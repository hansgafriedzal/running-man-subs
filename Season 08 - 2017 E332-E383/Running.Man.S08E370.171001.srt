00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,770
(People's Recommendation Project: A Place for 1 Percent)

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:16,580
(Those with 3 I Go Stickers must travel with another member.)

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,950
(Haha and So Min were chosen to receive a penalty.)

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,950
(So Min's destination is...)

5
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,420
(Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car.)

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,431
(So Min's partner is Kwang Soo, the penalty maniac.)

7
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,570
(The day finally came.)

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,871
(Kwang Soo and So Min leave to receive the penalty.)

9
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:46,041
(Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour started.)

10
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,511
(The only money they got was the allowance from the members.)

11
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:56,450
(They had to pick envelopes that seem to contain a lot of money.)

12
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,890
(Kwang Soo picked Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok's envelopes.)

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,121
(So Min picked Haha, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan's envelopes.)

14
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,761
(Kwang Soo received 96 dollars and So Min received 54 dollars.)

15
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:10,700
(Let's see you in Indonesia for Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour.)

16
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,771
(They finally go to their destination.)

17
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:21,780
(A steep cliff and violent waves)

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,420
(The riders must fight against the waves on a wooden cable car.)

19
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,021
(The rough journey starts now.)

20
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:34,791
(Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game)

21
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:39,560
(Find the one who is speaking the truth.)

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,231
(The fierce battle for the truth between the tiger moths starts now.)

23
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:50,410
(It's an autumn day that contains the abundance of Chuseok.)

24
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,440
- Hello. - Hello.

25
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,981
- Hello. - Hello.

26
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,610
- Hello. - Hello.

27
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,950
- What is this? - Hello.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,310
Hello.

29
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,420
What is this?

30
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,750
This must be a historic site.

31
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,791
(C rest stop has a statue of a Goguryeo warrior on a horse.)

32
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,021
Is that Genghis Khan?

33
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,160
(Does he think he is in Mongolia?)

34
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,690
Genghis Khan?

35
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,790
- Why would Genghis Khan be here? - Seriously.

36
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,931
Why would Genghis Khan be here?

37
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,671
I see.

38
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,130
It looks like a statue of an unknown warrior.

39
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:22,040
We need to take a look at Haha's outfit.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,510
(The statue isn't the only thing we need to take a look at.)

41
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,810
(He is armed with an outfit of bright colors.)

42
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,181
Everyone was laughing when he came in.

43
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,451
(The fashionista who spreads hipness in North Chungcheong Province, Haha)

44
00:02:32,451 --> 00:02:34,250
He is wearing Lee Deok Hwa's clothes again.

45
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,551
I burst out laughing as soon as I saw him.

46
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,790
(He is wearing Lee Deok Hwa's clothes again.)

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,021
It's morning soccer league fashion.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,560
Chris Brown.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
- What? - Chris Brown.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,060
- For goodness' sake. - Be quiet and eat the brownie.
	

51
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,361
- Chris Brown, my foot. - He doesn't dress like that.

52
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,801
- You have toothpaste on your shirt. - Where?

53
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,940
(You should worry about yourself.)

54
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,271
Really?

55
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:55,341
- Where? - Really?

56
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,970
- It's all over the shirt. - He wears it at home,

57
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,810
at a shoot, when he sleeps, and when he works out.

58
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,540
He is well-known for not having a lot of clothes.

59
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,750
- Listen. - I should buy him clothes.

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,380
I really have multiple sets of the same items.

61
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
- I plan to post a picture of them. - I see.

62
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,461
After the late Steve Jobs...

63
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,690
(He only wears black clothes.)

64
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,861
- He is incredible. - It's comfortable.

65
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,290
- You should post a picture. - It's comfortable.

66
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,130
- He only wears one outfit. - His fashion never changes.

67
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,500
- It's comfortable. - He only wears one outfit.

68
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,070
So Min wants people to talk about her outfit, too.

69
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,301
- No, I don't. - Her outfit matches Jae Seok's.

70
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,871
You should pull down your pants a little.

71
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,510
- Look at her pants. - Seriously.

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,181
- You pulled up your pants too high. - Listen.

73
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,980
Don't say such things to So Min.

74
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,151
- Why not? - So Min will find it funny.

75
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,081
- She will pull up her pants higher. - That's right.

76
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,480
- She will pull up her pants higher. - That's right.

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,521
She will pull them up to her chest.

78
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,250
She will wear them as a top.

79
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,250
She will pull them up to here.

80
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,991
She takes things to extremes.

81
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,160
These pants come with suspenders.

82
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
My goodness.

83
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,060
Kwang Soo got his hair cut.

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,290
I got my hair cut.

85
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,461
- It's refreshing to look at. - He looks like a human being now.

86
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,530
A haircut is necessary.

87
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,671
People said a haircut will make him look better, but he looks the same.

88
00:03:58,671 --> 00:03:59,671
(He looks the same.)

89
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:02,070
You say that because you are used to my changing styles.

90
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,341
Didn't Ahn Jung Hwan have that hairstyle in 2002?

91
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,940
- The windswept hairstyle. - What are you talking about?

92
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,750
What are you doing?

93
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,421
(He tries a kiss on the ring.)

94
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,421
All right.

95
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,021
(The producer cuts them off.)

96
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,321
He knows when to cut us off.

97
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,591
- That was clean. - He knows we are out of ideas.

98
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,061
- "All right." - It's time to move on.

99
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:28,160
We have an announcement to make before the start of the race.

100
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,530
- Okay. - My goodness.

101
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:31,771
Similar to So Min and Kwang Soo,

102
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,040
Haha and Se Chan had planned...

103
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,470
to go to Giant Canyon Swing to carry out their penalty.

104
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:42,581
(They were supposed to go to Giant Canyon Swing in September.)

105
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,581
Why aren't they going?

106
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,480
Due to complications,

107
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,280
the media visa is getting delayed.

108
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,651
They don't have the media visa yet.

109
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,961
Before the end of this year...

110
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,160
- Our penalty is gone. - Nice!

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
- Yes! - Really?

112
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,360
- Let's pass! - That's complete nonsense.

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,961
- There is no way we can go. - Can a penalty go away like that?

114
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,061
- Look for something in Korea. - It's still valid.

115
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,401
(The situation can't be helped.)

116
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,571
I learned about this...

117
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,401
from "Live Info Show".

118
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,071
- The longest zipline... - That's right.

119
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,470
- in Korea was just made. - A zipline.

120
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,941
- Send them over there. - It's the longest zipline in Korea.

121
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:18,850
(The length of 389m promises to make them forget about the US.)

122
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,581
Why would you watch something like that?

123
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:21,620
Seriously.

124
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,790
- It's incredible. - It's on par with the one in Spain.

125
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,660
You can get a beautiful view of the nature.

126
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,660
Seriously. It will be beautiful.

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,430
- It will be incredible. - The view will be beautiful.

128
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,561
- Thank you for a nice input. - All right.

129
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:36,970
I bet my entire fortune Jae Seok will end up on it.

130
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,401
(I bet my entire fortune Jae Seok will end up on it.)

131
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,970
Seriously. It will happen before this year passes.

132
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,540
- Hey. - Jae Seok...

133
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,040
Jae Seok will hit his own mouth...

134
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,980
and say that he shouldn't have said anything.

135
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,180
I bet you will sit next to him with your entire fortune.

136
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,881
I bet he will be holding a crocodile.

137
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,550
- He will be holding a crocodile. - That's right.

138
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,761
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok enjoy the longest zipline in Korea.)

139
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,321
- For goodness' sake. - A crocodile.

140
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,831
That's right.

141
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:07,530
Anyway, we must complete the penalty before the year passes.

142
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,530
That's right.

143
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,370
That's why we came up with a plan to replace it with another swing.

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,370
The original destination was Giant Canyon Swing.

145
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,271
When we visit Australia for Kwang Soo's penalty,

146
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,410
we will visit New Zealand as well.

147
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,910
- That's a good idea. - You will go to New Zealand.

148
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:22,040
Then they can go on Nevis Swing.

149
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,350
(Let's go to Nevis Swing, the place the crew recommends.)

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,581
(It's the biggest swing in the world.)

151
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:32,790
(It's a destination the members were the wariest of.)

152
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,160
That's a good idea. They always find a way.

153
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,091
- Are you saying we will go on it? - Why?

154
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:40,061
The zipline that was on "Live Info Show"...

155
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:41,860
- would be preferable. - Seriously.

156
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,331
Nevis Swing seemed intense.

157
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:45,571
It sounds like...

158
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,600
we should come to an agreement.

159
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,571
Since it isn't the destination we picked,

160
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,511
we should come to an agreement.

161
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,280
What do you think about the change?

162
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,540
- My head hurts. - They should do it.

163
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,151
As a viewer, I am curious.

164
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,280
The viewers would be upset...

165
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,021
- if they don't hold their promise. - For goodness' sake.

166
00:07:02,251 --> 00:07:04,490
Those crazy swings should be destroyed.

167
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:06,790
They must be frustrated.

168
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,420
I am glad I won't be going on that swing.

169
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,160
That place would make a nice alternative, too.

170
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,300
- Which place? - The one from "Live Info Show".

171
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,061
Did you invest in that zipline?

172
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,631
You brought it up so many times.

173
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,370
Isn't it better than Nevis Swing?

174
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,430
It's definitely better.

175
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,670
- It's much better. - You won't have to go abroad.

176
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,771
Would you please let us choose from a few options?

177
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:27,980
- The one in New Zealand is... - We will look up all the swings.

178
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,711
We will look up all the swings.

179
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:31,011
There is a swing in Jamsil, too.

180
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:32,550
Let's move on so that we can relocate to the shade.

181
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,751
(The producer cuts them off.)

182
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,951
Finally, Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car...

183
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:38,151
Is the talk over?

184
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,151
Are we really going?

185
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,860
You are really going.

186
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,261
You are going.

187
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,660
(Do we really need to go?)

188
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,701
Since the two countries are close, choosing either of them...

189
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,261
If I choose either of them, the production cost will be reduced.

190
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,970
- The plane tickets. - You are right.

191
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,941
- They can visit the two countries. - That's right.

192
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:54,941
The three of you should go.

193
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,110
Will one person see crocodiles and ride the swing?

194
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,470
Haha, you are in trouble.

195
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,881
(Am I going as Kwang Soo's plus one?)

196
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,410
You have to see the crocodiles, too.

197
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,280
Why do I need to go?

198
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,350
Seriously.

199
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,120
- It's your penalty. - I get that, but...

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,521
I get that it's my penalty, but...

201
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,920
Can I shave my head instead?

202
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,061
(Can I shave my head instead?)

203
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,660
Let's say for now that you are going.

204
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,360
(The producer is resolute.)

205
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,300
He isn't interested in Haha shaving his head.

206
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,470
- I guess he really wants you to go. - Seriously.

207
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:26,670
He isn't interested in Haha shaving his head.

208
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,870
He doesn't care whether he shaves his head...

209
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,240
- or not. - That's right.

210
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,841
He and I can go to Brazil and get Brazilian waxing.

211
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,411
We can do that.

212
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,411
All right.

213
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:35,480
(He isn't interested in waxing either.)

214
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,551
- Will it end like this? - All right.

215
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:40,451
He doesn't care whether you get Brazilian waxing or not.

216
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,951
Not too long ago, Kwang Soo and So Min rode...

217
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:47,860
- Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car. - Yes.

218
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,961
(They are done with their penalty.)

219
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,730
How was it, So Min?

220
00:08:53,061 --> 00:08:54,100
What is it?

221
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,331
I survived on the allowances you sent me.

222
00:08:57,331 --> 00:08:58,331
That's right.

223
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,941
We had a race with that money.

224
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,671
- Really? - I got 100 dollars.

225
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,711
(Their race piques the other members' interest.)

226
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,341
- So Min got 50 dollars. - Really?

227
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,880
All right. So this is the race we have prepared for today.

228
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,650
It's Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

229
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,551
(The crew prepared Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.)

230
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:14,250
It's Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

231
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,821
- Truth or Dare? - I used to host the show back then.

232
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,490
Kwang Soo is good at this game.

233
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,120
I like this game.

234
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,291
This game will be an individual match.

235
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,260
There will be four rounds in total.

236
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,400
- It's an individual match? - Yes.

237
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,730
We will watch the clips from Tiger Moth Tour in Indonesia soon.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,970
Questions of the game will be based on this trip.

239
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,201
(Questions about their trip will be presented.)

240
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,240
Kwang Soo and So Min will read the question...

241
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,270
and choose either one of Truth or False Cards.

242
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,781
(Kwang Soo and So Min will choose either one of Truth or False Cards.)

243
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,980
Answer according to your cards, and claim that you're telling the truth.

244
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,681
We have to find out who's telling the truth.

245
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:47,520
Other members will listen to So Min and Kwang Soo...

246
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,421
and choose the person you think is telling the truth.

247
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:53,490
(Members must choose who they think is telling the truth.)

248
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,490
Whoever chooses the correct member will be exempted from the penalty.

249
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,031
From what penalty will we be exempted?

250
00:09:57,191 --> 00:09:59,831
Whoever makes the wrong guess will face the penalty...

251
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:01,701
and receive a penalty badge.

252
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,230
The penalty badge is at stake for every round.

253
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,730
- I see. - It's for every round?

254
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,770
Kwang Soo and So Min. Regardless of the result of the rounds,

255
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,010
you will be exempted if the majority of the members chooses you.

256
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,740
If you aren't chosen by the majority, you'll face the penalty...

257
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,380
and receive the penalty badge.

258
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,620
(Whoever isn't chosen will face the penalty and get the badge.)

259
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:21,250
After the race,

260
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,921
two members with the most number of penalty badges...

261
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,791
will get to proceed with Chuseok live travel broadcast.

262
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:31,031
(2 members with most badges must broadcast on Chuseok about traffic.)

263
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,591
Goodness, this is the worst.

264
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,461
- Broadcast on Chuseok? - You want us to do a live show?

265
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,061
You want us to do a live show?

266
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:37,531
(Are you serious?)

267
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:43,571
(2 members will deliver a live segment on Chuseok in real life.)

268
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,640
On which date though?

269
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,911
- It will be on October 8. - Sorry?

270
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,441
- October 8? - The 8th?

271
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:51,110
- It's the last Sunday. - The last Sunday of the holidays.

272
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,880
- I bet the traffic will be heavy. - The traffic is the worst then.

273
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,520
- I really don't want to do this. - Where will we broadcast?

274
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,750
- 2 of us will do it? - Yes, 2 of you will do it.

275
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,890
- You know how it looks. - Basically, I...

276
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,821
(A man only gazes afar while the announcement is made.)

277
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,331
- He only tells lies. - It's all a lie.

278
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,531
I can't focus on the game today.

279
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,031
He keeps asking me the questions.

280
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,370
"Is it over?"

281
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:18,841
(I can only think about how I will be on that swing.)

282
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,681
Unless it's hilarious, I don't think I can laugh today. I keep...

283
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,480
- I can see the despair on his face. - You should go and face it then.

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,181
You should get on the lane bound for Seoul and go to Seoul.

285
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:28,880
(You can go home early today.)

286
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,390
Lane bound for Seoul?

287
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,821
You can just head to Gimpo International Airport.

288
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,921
- I must get on it after my work. - I mean it's...

289
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,260
All right. We will begin Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game now.

290
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,561
- All right. - Excuse me.

291
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,661
- I should do my best then. - I must make the correct guesses.

292
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,801
Otherwise, I'll work during the holidays.

293
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:45,000
- Tell me the rules of the game. - I need to try my best today.

294
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,941
- Everything? - I wasn't paying attention.

295
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,640
This will happen in the morning of the eighth?

296
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,071
We'll end up getting on the Nevis Swing.

297
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:53,140
(Don't even worry about the game. We'll end up going there.)

298
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,850
This is the 1st round of 4 rounds.

299
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,620
Let the first round of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game begin.

300
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,720
We're starting? Gosh, I need to do a good job.

301
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,350
I have to do well today. I'm serious.

302
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,451
To be honest,

303
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:07,520
- I'm free on the last day. - Right.

304
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,561
But I don't want to come in for work on the last day of the holidays.

305
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,561
- We'll spend at least two hours. - Exactly.

306
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:15,260
I'm not chosen for the penalties that we have to go abroad because...

307
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm not scared and because I actually want to go.

308
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,770
- But I don't want this penalty. - Is that so?

309
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,171
- But I think I might get this. - Why don't you like this penalty?

310
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,841
- What's there to like it? - Why do you say that?

311
00:12:24,841 --> 00:12:27,711
- I have to come in on a day off. - Let's help Jong Kook get this one.

312
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:30,150
- Because it's not a scary ride? - Right.

313
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,980
- So this is bothersome to him. - He doesn't want to waste his time.

314
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,281
Let me ask this.

315
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:34,980
What's your plan on the last day of the holidays?

316
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,921
(Why don't you want to put aside time on the last day?)

317
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,791
I need to work out.

318
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,961
- I must exercise. - Hold on a minute.

319
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,431
- I have to work out. - You only need to work out.

320
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,061
It's annoying to go back and forth.

321
00:12:47,061 --> 00:12:49,400
But the idea of coming to work on that day is the worst.

322
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,571
- I agree. - But still.

323
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:54,041
On this round, a meal ticket at the rest stop is at stake.

324
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,100
(1st round of Truth Game)

325
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,841
The member who gets the answer will win a meal ticket.

326
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,711
- The food there is great. - This is amazing.

327
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:02,041
The member who gets the wrong answer will not be allowed to eat...

328
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,711
and will receive a penalty badge.

329
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,951
We win when we get the majority of the votes, right?

330
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,150
Kwang Soo and So Min.

331
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,051
The one who gets the majority of the votes can eat.

332
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,490
- Or you'll get a penalty badge. - I might not get to eat.

333
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,360
Kwang Soo is terrible at lying, but So Min is just as horrible.

334
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,000
- They easily get flustered. - Besides, they tell small lies.

335
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,400
Our credibility is in the gutter.

336
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,071
I can spot his lies when I observe his face,

337
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,571
- but not So Min. I don't know hers. - I don't know her well.

338
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:28,701
- But she gets flustered. - But...

339
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,270
don't you trust me though?

340
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,171
- No way. - What nonsense are you saying?

341
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,341
No, we don't trust you.

342
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:36,041
So Min tends to tell small lies...

343
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,480
instead of lying about important stuff.

344
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:38,681
But...

345
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,951
the only thing he does in his life is lie.

346
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:43,321
How could you? How could you criticize about my life?

347
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,120
- She's not wrong though. - What do you mean...

348
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,250
- by that? - She's right.

349
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:48,220
His life is filled with lies. It's true.

350
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,831
What do you mean my life is filled with lies?

351
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,860
I'll play the first video of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

352
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,600
All we have to do is choose, right?

353
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,270
What kind of a clip is this?

354
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,571
It's been a while hosting a show while sitting down.

355
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,370
- While sitting down? - I'm serious.

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,770
- We are sitting down. - We're watching clips.

357
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,311
Let me play the clip.

358
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,770
Play the video.

359
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,411
(The video for the 1st round is played.)

360
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:11,311
(The 1st question of the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game)

361
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,681
We are really going.

362
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,750
(2 weeks ago, Incheon International Airport)

363
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,791
(We are really going to Indonesia at last.)

364
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,520
- There are so many people here. - I can't believe this is happening.

365
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,821
Am I going to Indonesia or Australia?

366
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,390
There are so many people.

367
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,461
They must be going to Indonesia...

368
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:29,331
- to receive the penalty. - What are you talking about?

369
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,801
Come to your senses.

370
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,500
You should wash your face on the plane.

371
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:43,110
(They set out to Yogyakarta which takes 10 hours in total.)

372
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,980
(From Jakarta to Yogyakarta, it takes 1 hour and 20 minutes.)

373
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,220
(9pm, at Adisutjipto International Airport)

374
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,380
- Hey. - Goodness.

375
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:49,921
This is nice.

376
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,921
(Various cultures coexist in Indonesia.)

377
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,291
- Was that good? - It was so good.

378
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,390
(Noises fill the airport.)

379
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,931
- You got to try it? - Kwang Soo surprised me.

380
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:02,801
- He's the Prince of Asia. - Right.

381
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,900
(Welcome, Prince of Asia.)

382
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,000
Pay attention to his face now.

383
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,571
- So Min told me... - But the thing is...

384
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:12,470
she was disgusted by his facial expression then.

385
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:15,240
(They're excited to see Kwang Soo.)

386
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,750
Look at that face.

387
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,911
(He puts on a look as if he's the national guest.)

388
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,451
But the thing is that...

389
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,321
- he never does this with his hands. - That's my point.

390
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,051
- He doesn't do that. - He rarely does this.

391
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,561
- But aren't you envious? - But this...

392
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,431
(They welcome the betrayer couple.)

393
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,360
- There were so many people. - Lee Kwang Soo!

394
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,071
- Kwang Soo! - Look at you.

395
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,201
Kwang Soo is so popular.

396
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,171
It's not something that we can witness in Korea.

397
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,270
Look at his unusual smile.

398
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,411
(But at the thought of the penalty, he gets sad.)

399
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:50,980
We really came.

400
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:52,911
This is where we finally ended up.

401
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,720
I had no idea that we'd be here.

402
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,821
(The Tiger Moth Tour begins. What kind of misfortunes awaits?)

403
00:15:58,821 --> 00:15:59,961
We're here.

404
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,890
- We are finally here. - Your hotel is nice.

405
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,760
- Gosh, that's a fancy hotel. - That's a five-star hotel.

406
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,461
Tell us about our schedule.

407
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,031
We were informed the seventh floor is the lobby.

408
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:11,831
I'll share the schedule in the lobby.

409
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,970
We prepared a meal since we figured you'd be hungry.

410
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,411
And you can have a good night's sleep.

411
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,811
You'll face the penalty tomorrow. That's the schedule.

412
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,140
Then we can sleep tonight?

413
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,951
(Since tomorrow will be a long day, they're letting us rest.)

414
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:26,720
(They arrive in the lobby at ease.)

415
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,620
You jumped in Korea, remember?

416
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,350
- Do we have to do it? - Let's jump again.

417
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,020
- We arrived here. - You know how it works, right?

418
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:35,120
- We'll jump, and we'll be here. - We arrived here from Korea.

419
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,661
1, 2, 3.

420
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:37,760
(Jumping)

421
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,031
(What on earth are you doing?)

422
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,000
(But they're doing their best acting the scene.)

423
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:50,811
- Why didn't, did you edit that? - Why didn't you edit it?

424
00:16:50,811 --> 00:16:52,110
- You promised us. - Why didn't you edit that?

425
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,681
- But no one does that nowadays. - Right.

426
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,110
- That... - I used to do that.

427
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,250
- Didn't "Wooroemae" use that? - Exactly.

428
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,551
(Didn't "Wooroemae" use that?)

429
00:17:00,551 --> 00:17:01,821
So Min suggested doing it.

430
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:03,150
1, 2, 3.

431
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,150
(This technique was seen in "Wooroemae" in 1986.)

432
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,460
(Where are you, villains?)

433
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,331
(Grabbing him by his collar)

434
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,630
What are you doing? What's going on?

435
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:15,960
(What is your problem?)

436
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,331
- It's from this morning. - What's wrong with you?

437
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:19,370
(From this morning?)

438
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,140
(She grabbed him by his collar in the morning,)

439
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,610
(and it continues even in Indonesia.)

440
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,011
- Combine it from the morning. - What's wrong with you?

441
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,910
How can they combine the two clips?

442
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
This is so weird. Are we in Indonesia?

443
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,221
We are in Indonesia, right?

444
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,021
- Yes, we are in Indonesia. - We're in Yogyakarta.

445
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,491
Anyway, you have arrived in Indonesia.

446
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,600
Since it's been a long day, give us your bags. We'll move them for you.

447
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,900
Hand us your bags.

448
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:50,331
We'll give you the cards for your rooms.

449
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:52,130
Kwang Soo, you have Room 549.

450
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,170
- So Min, here's yours. - Thank you.

451
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,771
It's Room 501.

452
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,541
Can't I put the bag in my room?

453
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,341
- No, let us. - I can do it.

454
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,910
- Something's going on. - I can do it.

455
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,680
- They gave us the card, but why... - You can't give them that easily.

456
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,781
You willingly gave them your luggage.

457
00:18:07,781 --> 00:18:09,751
You have received the cards for your rooms.

458
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,521
Take a brief recess, and we'll resume later.

459
00:18:12,721 --> 00:18:13,960
We can go up now?

460
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,291
- Yes. - I can take a shower now?

461
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:17,130
Yes, you can. Do whatever you want.

462
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,291
(But what about our bags?)

463
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,430
Can we take our luggage?

464
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,460
I need my luggage to wash.

465
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,700
Why did they take the luggage?

466
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,071
(But the luggage the crew took hasn't moved.)

467
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,700
Your luggage...

468
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,100
has been confiscated by the crew.

469
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,511
(It's confiscated by the crew?)

470
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,710
(Confiscated!)

471
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,481
(No way.)

472
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:38,551
What are you doing?

473
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,920
- I saw that coming. - This is so awkward.

474
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,620
Seriously. Why did you give it to them?

475
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,821
- You fell for it so easily. - What are you doing?

476
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:48,021
- The producer isn't normal. - It's confiscated?

477
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:50,061
There's a reason that we took away your luggage.

478
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,130
It's right in front of us.

479
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,301
I can just take this, can't I?

480
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,700
How could you...

481
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:02,841
There are only two ways of retrieving your luggage.

482
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:05,241
You will have to either accomplish your given mission.

483
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,410
Or for 30 dollars, you may take...

484
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,680
- 30 dollars? - 1 item.

485
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,910
(They must pay 30 dollars per item.)

486
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,180
(Unbelievable)

487
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,581
I only have 50 dollars.

488
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:16,321
- Isn't it three dollars? - This is stealing.

489
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:18,450
They're thieves.

490
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,660
Do we pay if we fail the mission?

491
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:23,360
- If you clear the mission... - Can we take it?

492
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,761
If you clear it, you may take the luggage for free.

493
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,960
I keep asking, but did I do something wrong?

494
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,071
- All my things... - Our trip here was too easy.

495
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:32,630
I thought it was strange.

496
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,241
Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour...

497
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:36,910
has started.

498
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,910
Here's your first mission.

499
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:46,110
Let's start Catch the Bag If You Can.

500
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,620
- There's a title. - Did someone...

501
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,751
come up with the title?

502
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,350
We do a lot of research.

503
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,551
(We work hard constantly.)

504
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,221
Catch the Bag If You Can.

505
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,761
There's a traditional Indonesian game called Spoon and Marble Race.

506
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,100
- Spoon and Marble Race? - You must pass the goal while...

507
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,331
holding a spoon with a marble with your mouth.

508
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,630
Didn't we play that often?

509
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,700
- Right. - Right?

510
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,011
We're in a hotel, so we can't run.

511
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,081
Hold the spoon in your mouth. Without dropping the marble,

512
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,610
transfer it to the person next to you.

513
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,110
You succeed if you place the marble in the cup.

514
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,051
- This is easy. - Are we on the same team?

515
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:21,821
Yes. You have 60 seconds.

516
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:24,950
You succeed if you place over 10 marbles in the goal.

517
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,120
- This is possible. - I agree.

518
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,160
They're given a mission as soon as they arrive.

519
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,430
I bet it was annoying.

520
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,130
I couldn't believe it.

521
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:39,031
(Let's make 10 marbles in the goal.)

522
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,971
10 marbles in 60 seconds means you succeed.

523
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:45,471
You may take your luggage without paying.

524
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,041
If you fail, you must pay.

525
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,581
- Okay. - Get ready.

526
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,180
Let's do it.

527
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,950
Start.

528
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,581
(Spoon and Marble Race starts.)

529
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,221
(Being careful)

530
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,860
It's similar to the marble game during childhood.

531
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,920
- It doesn't seem hard. - It wasn't.

532
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,791
- They should move faster. - We play games often.

533
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,001
Kwang Soo is getting faster.

534
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:11,200
So Min should lower herself to make it faster.

535
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,801
They should have switched places.

536
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,640
Transferring the marble is easier.

537
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,140
So Min wanted to do it.

538
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:19,011
- I see. - Marbles are heavy.

539
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,741
They might knock over the cup.

540
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:23,210
- It isn't difficult. - 30 seconds passed.

541
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,210
You have 10 seconds.

542
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,420
- He's good at receiving it. - Right.

543
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,321
How many are there?

544
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:32,991
- 3, 2, 1. - We did it.

545
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:33,991
(How many marbles are in the cup?)

546
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:35,291
Time is up.

547
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:37,261
Let's count the marbles.

548
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:38,591
My teeth hurt.

549
00:21:38,591 --> 00:21:39,591
(It's time to count.)

550
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:43,001
1, 2, 3, 4,

551
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:46,900
5, 6, 7, 8.

552
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,670
(Currently, there are 8 marbles.)

553
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,011
(Did they place 10 marbles?)

554
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,771
- Is it less than 10? - They have 8.

555
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:54,940
We cleared the mission in one go.

556
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,081
- 8, 9, 10. - We have 10.

557
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,920
(They succeed.)

558
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,350
We have 10.

559
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,190
- We made it. - Didn't we?

560
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,190
- We work well as a team. - That was fast.

561
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,890
It was hard to succeed.

562
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,890
(They feel overwhelmed.)

563
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,831
- We worked well together then. - Right.

564
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,660
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo could put 11.

565
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,031
Of course. We would make it easily.

566
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:17,370
- Did you think you said the answer? - Yes.

567
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,430
(She was nervous.)

568
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,640
- I shouldn't say anything. - You shouldn't.

569
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,210
- We made it. - It was almost impossible.

570
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,210
(They can take the luggage for free.)

571
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,880
- You cleared the mission. - Okay.

572
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:31,680
- Our teamwork makes it possible. - You'll get your luggage.

573
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,521
Between the two of you,

574
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,521
choose which luggage you'll open.

575
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:40,160
- Must we choose one? - I have everything in it.

576
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,390
- Can't we open both? - Do we open only one?

577
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:44,460
You can open only one of them.

578
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,160
You didn't tell us before.

579
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:48,061
You're so mean.

580
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,170
You must take items in the luggage.

581
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,700
I want to slap Chul Min on the neck.

582
00:22:56,071 --> 00:22:58,440
- I'm serious. - What do you have in your bag?

583
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,410
- What do you have? - I have everything.

584
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,910
- Me too. - I have two luggage.

585
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,251
I have everything in my luggage. Let's open mine.

586
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,420
I will let you if you pay me 2.5 dollars.

587
00:23:11,321 --> 00:23:12,521
How about 2.3 dollars?

588
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:15,591
- Pay two dollars. - I don't have much money.

589
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,831
Let's open mine. I'll pay you two dollars.

590
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,801
- I can't give more than two. - Okay.

591
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:22,430
- Two dollars? - Okay.

592
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,501
(They agree to open Kwang Soo's.)

593
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,071
Kwang Soo pays two dollars to open his luggage.

594
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,370
- Okay. - Goodness.

595
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,971
- I gave her two dollars. - Let's open his.

596
00:23:28,971 --> 00:23:30,011
(Current mission money status)

597
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,370
- So Min has 56 dollars. - Kwang Soo has a lot.

598
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,011
(He finally opens his luggage.)

599
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,281
Here are the toiletries.

600
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,450
You have nothing in it.

601
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,081
You can only open it once.

602
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:42,120
- I'll take my toiletries. - You can only open it once.

603
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,051
Show us what you have inside the luggage.

604
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,150
I have this.

605
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,620
(Is that a game player?)

606
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,630
Why did you bring it all the way here?

607
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,501
We have a lot of free time.

608
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:56,160
- Why did you pack that? - Why did you take a game player?

609
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,100
He has the wrong attitude.

610
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,041
- He has no common sense. - I agree.

611
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,271
(Goodness)

612
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,640
You shouldn't waste electricity at the hotel.

613
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,781
Electricity?

614
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,680
What's wrong with using it?

615
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,680
- Put back the item that you chose. - Okay.

616
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,650
(He puts it back in the luggage.)

617
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,350
What's this?

618
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,190
- It glows in the dark. - Why did you bring it?

619
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,721
- Why did you pack that? - What for?

620
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,331
- Why did you take the frog? - What is it for?

621
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:24,860
It's for sleeping.

622
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,531
(Frog that glows in the dark makes him sleep better.)

623
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,200
I get scared to sleep in unfamiliar places.

624
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,771
You may take only one item...

625
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,200
from your luggage.

626
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:34,900
I must take toiletries.

627
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,170
To take an item from the luggage,

628
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:40,710
throw an Indonesian coin into the luggage.

629
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:46,180
(He may take the item that he hits with a coin.)

630
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,620
You may take the first item that you hit with the coin.

631
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,390
You should tell us before.

632
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,021
- Why didn't you? - Is there another mission?

633
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:54,261
- That's so unfair. - Come on.

634
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,120
That's horrible.

635
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,160
- Let's be fair. - Goodness.

636
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,001
There are too many missions.

637
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,430
- Does that make sense? - That's too much.

638
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,170
We already cleared the mission.

639
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,501
How could you, Chul Min?

640
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:08,341
Am I going to New Zealand?

641
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,910
(He only thinks of himself.)

642
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,710
Watch the video. Forget about New Zealand.

643
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,610
I can't concentrate.

644
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,110
What about the two dollars that I paid?

645
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:19,311
- Throw the coin behind the line. - I remember these boxers.

646
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,920
(Which boxers?)

647
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,591
- I remember them. - What are you doing?

648
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,821
- What are you doing? - Remember the ones you showed?

649
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:30,061
- I wore each of them. - Remember?

650
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,561
(It was during a family special.)

651
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,301
I remember the rainbow boxers.

652
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,700
- Is it that one? - Yes.

653
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,771
- Do you still have them? - Didn't they rot?

654
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,741
Kwang Soo likes those colors.

655
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,571
- Didn't they stretch? - No, they didn't.

656
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,071
They shrank when I washed them.

657
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,110
This is an Indonesian coin.

658
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,081
Excuse me, Mr. Producer.

659
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:52,081
(She calls the producer.)

660
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:54,321
Can you tell us if there's another mission?

661
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,420
- Is it the last mission? - It should be.

662
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,350
- It's the last. - There can't be more.

663
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,890
Who throws the coin?

664
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,920
- One of you can do it. - It's me.

665
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,960
(Trust me.)

666
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,531
- Can you do it? - Of course.

667
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:07,160
I don't think you can.

668
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,430
There's something that we brought.

669
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,501
It's called slime monster.

670
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:13,501
- Try to throw it. - It's hard to throw.

671
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:16,001
(He throws the slime monster to test it.)

672
00:26:16,001 --> 00:26:18,571
- Gosh. - It's okay.

673
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:19,880
- What do you mean? - I'll try again.

674
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,311
It's not okay.

675
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:25,251
(The grip isn't so bad.)

676
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,721
- It's good enough. - It won't work.

677
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:29,890
- I don't think so. - It doesn't matter.

678
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,221
Throw the coin instead. Kwang Soo.

679
00:26:32,521 --> 00:26:35,321
(What's going on?)

680
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,190
(The slime monster is everywhere.)

681
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,890
- Gosh. - What happened?

682
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,200
It's all over my clothes.

683
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:43,900
What is it?

684
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,571
- It's slime. - What?

685
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,170
Please say, "challenge".

686
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,610
(He decides to throw the coin.)

687
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,640
- It's because of the slime monster. - Can he take the whole luggage?

688
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,910
(It's not as easy as he thought.)

689
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,481
- Goodness. - Wait.

690
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:03,221
Can you pull it toward the right?

691
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,251
(Hello.)

692
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,091
It's still here.

693
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:08,091
(He finds more slime monster.)

694
00:27:08,091 --> 00:27:10,261
It's everywhere. What's going on?

695
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,291
- It's like cell division. - What is it?

696
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:14,360
Did it reproduce?

697
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,761
What's going on?

698
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,170
I keep finding more.

699
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,031
It's slime monster.

700
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:20,140
(It's an invasion of a green monster.)

701
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,841
My clothes turned green.

702
00:27:25,071 --> 00:27:26,140
Challenge.

703
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,581
(He plays the game.)

704
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,251
(Question for Round 1 of Truth Game)

705
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,581
- Please. - Is this the question?

706
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:35,981
I remember it.

707
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:39,420
(He throws the coin to determine which item to take.)

708
00:27:40,061 --> 00:27:43,061
- The coin could fall in between. - Which item did it hit?

709
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,960
It's the first item that the coin hits.

710
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,501
(Here's the first question.)

711
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,801
Which does the coin hit?

712
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,231
It's where the coin lands.

713
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,831
(Which item did Kwang Soo get?)

714
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:56,200
- Is it the first item that it hits? - What is it?

715
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,610
This is the question.

716
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,981
- Do you remember it? - I remember it clearly.

717
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:01,841
What was in his luggage?

718
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,110
- Boxers and toiletries. - A game player and a bag.

719
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,420
- Medicine. - Glow-in-the-dark frog.

720
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,751
It's not easy for the coin to land on the frog.

721
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,551
Kwang Soo and So Min.

722
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:16,091
Choose an envelope, and decide whether it's true or not.

723
00:28:16,091 --> 00:28:17,890
- Really? - True or false?

724
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:20,061
Is it only one of them who tells the truth?

725
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:22,061
- That's right. - Is that so?

726
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:25,430
(Which will Kwang Soo and So Min choose?)

727
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,771
Please come to the front 1 by 1.

728
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:31,370
- Make your statement. - Is it a statement?

729
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,241
- I state that... - We must listen carefully...

730
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,440
when Kwang Soo makes an argument.

731
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,481
I say that it's true.

732
00:28:37,481 --> 00:28:38,551
He looks relaxed.

733
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,920
- Also, - His face looks relaxed.

734
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,781
the coin landed on my underwear. I remember it clearly.

735
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:44,120
I remember it clearly.

736
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,591
(He says the coin landed on his underwear.)

737
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,460
Round 1 is easy.

738
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,930
You know it by looking at my face.

739
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,991
- Right. - Yes.

740
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,600
Will you only say the truth?

741
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,031
Yes. I'll only say the truth.

742
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,930
During Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour,

743
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:00,741
- did you sneak into So Min's room? - Sorry?

744
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,341
No, I didn't.

745
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,811
- What's with the glow-in-the-dark? - Sorry?

746
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,541
- The frog. - Did someone give it to you?

747
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,311
- Everyone's curious. - I bought it.

748
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,180
I don't like to sleep in the dark.

749
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,521
Did you buy two and give one to someone else?

750
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,450
This game doesn't work that way.

751
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,450
(Speechless)

752
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,950
When was your last kiss?

753
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:19,821
- Excuse me. - What's with you?

754
00:29:19,821 --> 00:29:21,190
Do you have a girlfriend?

755
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,620
Shut it.

756
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,591
- I don't. What's with you? - You don't?

757
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:27,130
Tell us the truth.

758
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,130
I'm telling you the truth.

759
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,231
He's getting angry.

760
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:31,630
We have to find the truth.

761
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,640
It's a truth game.

762
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,741
It's not the kind you play when you drink.

763
00:29:35,771 --> 00:29:37,271
Why are you so worked up?

764
00:29:37,271 --> 00:29:38,870
- I mean... - You look angry.

765
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,511
When you lie, you tend to say a lot.

766
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:44,380
Your explanation gets long. But let me tell you.

767
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,051
- Where did the coin end up? - Look at the bag.

768
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,251
Which item is taking...

769
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,551
the most space?

770
00:29:50,551 --> 00:29:51,791
- The game console? - Exactly.

771
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:54,491
It has a solid surface and takes up a lot of space.

772
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,831
Also, I think it was intentional.

773
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,531
He probably wanted to play games so badly.

774
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:02,761
(So Min says the coin ended up on the game console.)

775
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,271
Let me ask you one more question.

776
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:08,471
(Jae Seok wants to ask another question.)

777
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:11,910
What material was your toiletry bag?

778
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,481
What's with you?

779
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,511
(Stop pretending to be sharp.)

780
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,981
Stop playing detective.

781
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:19,880
- What was the material? - What's with the way you speak?

782
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,920
- Was it cloth? - Let me stand up.

783
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,120
- What was the material? - What?

784
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,620
- Am I a criminal? - What was it?

785
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,620
Cut it out.

786
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:29,761
It's not easy for the coin to end up right in the middle.

787
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,460
Did it go in directly or bounce in?

788
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,061
To be honest, I don't remember.

789
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:35,130
- You don't remember? - I don't.

790
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:38,170
Kwang Soo is telling the truth.

791
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:39,400
Let me explain.

792
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,170
Stop trying to manipulate us.

793
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,501
You're like Solomon.

794
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:43,971
Kwang Soo is telling the truth.

795
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,571
- Gosh. - You're telling the truth.

796
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:46,781
My goodness.

797
00:30:46,781 --> 00:30:48,481
We don't have to hear anymore.

798
00:30:48,481 --> 00:30:50,450
Are you being honest?

799
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,251
Of course. Kwang Soo packed the game console himself.

800
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,150
- It means he wanted to use it. - Then...

801
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,150
did he play games that night?

802
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
He said he did.

803
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:00,591
- He said he did. - What?

804
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,561
If he got the game console, he must have played games.

805
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:03,660
What is she saying?

806
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,761
- I mean... - He played alone?

807
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:06,400
- I didn't play games. - How can you not know?

808
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,501
She's either lying or talking gibberish.

809
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:12,771
I'd guess Kwang Soo is telling the truth,

810
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,170
- but I hate to see that face. - What do you mean?

811
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,140
(Jae Seok hates that Kwang Soo looks so confident.)

812
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,241
- It's disgusting. - It's disgusting.

813
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:22,180
- He looks so confident. - Right?

814
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,150
His face is disgusting.

815
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,450
- No, listen. - Your face is disgusting.

816
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,450
Gosh.

817
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,950
- I'm telling the truth. - If you want to shoot on the 8th,

818
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,091
- do whatever you want. - Oh, right.

819
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:34,491
- I won't say anymore. - I forgot about that.

820
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:36,690
- Let's have a good start. - That depends on this.

821
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,491
It'll decide whether we'll shoot on the 8th.

822
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:43,370
(Who is telling the truth, Kwang Soo or So Min?)

823
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,801
- One... - Hold on.

824
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:47,440
- Gosh. - My goodness.

825
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,140
This is huge.

826
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,271
If you get it wrong, you won't get any food.

827
00:31:51,271 --> 00:31:52,511
One.

828
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,581
(If they get it wrong, they'll get a penalty badge.)

829
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:54,581
- 2. - 2.

830
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,880
It'd be absurd if I lose.

831
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,081
Three.

832
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,450
(Whichever attracts more supporters will get to eat.)

833
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,180
(Whom will the members choose?)

834
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,221
- All right. - I choose So Min.

835
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:04,791
(Jae Suk and Ji Hyo choose So Min.)

836
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,160
(Kwang Soo attracted more supporters.)

837
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,291
Gosh! This is frustrating.

838
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,591
Why would you choose So Min?

839
00:32:11,591 --> 00:32:14,731
Kwang Soo was so calm.

840
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,031
So Min looked so frustrated.

841
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,571
Which item did Kwang Soo get?

842
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,801
Please put on your earphones.

843
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:22,900
Let's see it.

844
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,511
- Let's see it. - If Kwang Soo lied,

845
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27,410
it means he's a real actor.

846
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,380
So Min looked so frustrated.

847
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,650
You're a real actor.

848
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,481
So Min looked so...

849
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:35,981
Let's watch the video.

850
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,051
- Gosh. - Kwang Soo looked so natural.

851
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,660
So Min is still innocent.

852
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,991
Please. I'm worried.

853
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:46,660
(They can get only one item. Where did the coin end up?)

854
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
(The game console is right in the middle.)

855
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,731
- The game console was there? - It was there?

856
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,370
Then the coin might have ended up there.

857
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,910
- The game console was there? - Just watch.

858
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,251
(Did the coin end up on the underwear bag?)

859
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,481
(Game console)

860
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,650
You're getting the game console.

861
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:10,091
Hey.

862
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,650
(I can't believe this.)

863
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,390
He got the game console.

864
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:15,991
- The game console? - I got it right.

865
00:33:15,991 --> 00:33:16,991
Did I win?

866
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:20,261
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo get it right.)

867
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:21,531
- We got it right. - So Min.

868
00:33:21,531 --> 00:33:23,271
- So Min. - We got it right.

869
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:30,440
(The ones who were fooled by Kwang Soo will get no food.)

870
00:33:31,841 --> 00:33:34,680
(The only item they will have is the game console.)

871
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,680
Kwang Soo.

872
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
(The only item they will have is the game console.)

873
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,350
Can you wash your body with the game console?

874
00:33:40,081 --> 00:33:42,450
Why did you bring that?

875
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,120
You won't play games here.

876
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,791
I thought we wouldn't have a lot to do.

877
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,791
(I wanted to play games during our free time.)

878
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,890
Hold on.

879
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,130
- I was telling the truth. - Hold on.

880
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,200
Thank you for believing me.

881
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,001
Thank you.

882
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,971
It's Jong Kook's fault.

883
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,110
You led us on.

884
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,640
Jong Kook said it too loudly...

885
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,610
in the beginning.

886
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,551
- Right? - It's Jong Kook's fault.

887
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,250
Jong Kook got so many in trouble.

888
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,480
Stop doing that.

889
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,181
- I... - It's all his fault.

890
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,551
overlooked one thing.

891
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:19,190
I thought I was very close with Kwang Soo, but I wasn't.

892
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,491
(I wasn't so close with Kwang Soo.)

893
00:34:21,091 --> 00:34:22,920
- You were being fooled. - I didn't know that.

894
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,261
- You were fooled. - I didn't know.

895
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:25,690
I thought I was close with him.

896
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,161
Kwang Soo was fooling you with that sly look.

897
00:34:28,161 --> 00:34:30,601
Haha, why do you never trust me?

898
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,670
- I trusted you. - Why do you never trust me?

899
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,741
- I trusted you. - Does it make me a bad person...

900
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,270
and So Min a good person?

901
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,971
What is going on?

902
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,141
Everyone's apologizing to So Min.

903
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:41,980
You've lost your innocence.

904
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,480
- What? - You've lost your innocence.

905
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:45,781
Before, it showed when he was lying.

906
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,351
(Tiger Moth Tour Badges)

907
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,891
Order whatever you want.

908
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,051
Let's go.

909
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,591
- It's coming. - It's coming.

910
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,661
This is the charm of rest areas.

911
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:58,991
Who ordered pork cutlet? It looks so tasty.

912
00:34:59,161 --> 00:35:01,601
This rest area has their own dishes.

913
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,730
It's stew.

914
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:03,900
It looks tasty.

915
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,371
It tastes so good.

916
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:07,040
(Let's enjoy our food.)

917
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,741
Are we really not getting any food?

918
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,270
Really?

919
00:35:12,341 --> 00:35:13,681
It looked like the food was already ready.

920
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,911
The stew...

921
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:16,281
(Only Kwang Soo and the smart ones can enjoy lunch.)

922
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,411
It tastes amazing.

923
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:19,480
(Only Kwang Soo and the smart ones can enjoy lunch.)

924
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,420
Is there no lunch for us?

925
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,391
I'm sure there's another chance.

926
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,891
Are we really having no food?

927
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:25,920
(They were fooled, and they get no food.)

928
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,920
Seriously?

929
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,560
(Aren't you giving us any food?)

930
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,591
I get no food at home or at work.

931
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:34,431
(I'm so sad.)

932
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:36,471
You get no food at home or at work?

933
00:35:36,971 --> 00:35:38,871
Where can I eat?

934
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:39,900
You get no food at home?

935
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,770
- Where can I eat? - Prepare your own food.

936
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,741
- What? - Prepare your own food.

937
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:46,580
I thought you were on a diet.

938
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,880
I look thinner, right? I've lost 2kg.

939
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,880
(He's lost 2kg.)

940
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,451
Why are you not giving us any food?

941
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,491
(Everybody's laughing except for one person.)

942
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,451
(Panicking)

943
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:02,020
- What's wrong? - He thought about Nevis Swing.

944
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,591
- I thought about Nevis Swing. - Stop it.

945
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:08,360
I can't get this song out of my head.

946
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,371
(Swing, swing, swing, my baby)

947
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:14,170
(He's going to ride Nevis Swing with Se Chan.)

948
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,170
It keeps on playing in my head.

949
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,681
I can't stand it anymore.

950
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:21,681
(They're upset.)

951
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,580
Ji Hyo, give me some.

952
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,610
That seemed natural.

953
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
That seemed very natural.

954
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,420
(What are you doing?)

955
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,621
It looked very natural.

956
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,190
Gosh.

957
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,991
(Seok Jin was stopped by Jae Seok.)

958
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,460
What am I doing with a spoon in my hand at 50?

959
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,161
- Gosh. - Seok Jin.

960
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:42,761
I used to do that back in middle school.

961
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:44,900
One of my friends is a managing director of a company.

962
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,540
(He's upset.)

963
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,270
He's a managing director.

964
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:53,511
Another one is a senior managing director.

965
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,741
I have money too.

966
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,380
A friend of yours is retired even.

967
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,980
Observe the rules.

968
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,121
- What's with you? - Don't break the rules.

969
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:02,281
At your age.

970
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,420
Think of your age.

971
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,591
I can at least eat the salad, right?

972
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,991
If you don't even let me eat the salad, I'll get mad.

973
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:11,661
Do you have to eat it?

974
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:12,860
(Jae Seok stops him.)

975
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,801
Hey.

976
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,031
You punk.

977
00:37:17,871 --> 00:37:20,241
I'm seriously getting angry.

978
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,400
I mean it.

979
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,540
(Seok Jin is not even allowed to eat the salad.)

980
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,411
Let me at least eat the salad.

981
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,880
- I got him. - Let me eat the salad.

982
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Give up.

983
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,781
- I'm going to drink some water. - Give up.

984
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:32,781
Gosh, it's so annoying.

985
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,051
(All Seok Jin got was a sip of water.)

986
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:39,121
Please take the same seats as before.

987
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,690
(Good luck, Haha.)

988
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:44,761
It's you, right?

989
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:47,230
- Hey. - You're riding Nevis Swing with me.

990
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,630
Aren't you scared? Why are you so lively?

991
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:50,801
We're not there yet.

992
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:51,871
Gosh.

993
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:53,900
I'm so jealous of you two.

994
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,440
(I love New Zealand.)

995
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,241
- Really? - Yes.

996
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,141
This is why you never get penalized.

997
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:01,480
But you'll get penalized today.

998
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,781
Kwang Soo would never take you with him.

999
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,511
Why don't we do this?

1000
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:07,250
Se Chan and I will ride the swing,

1001
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,080
and you can just hang on to the rope.

1002
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,690
(Just hang on to the rope.)

1003
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,621
(That sounds fun.)

1004
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,560
- He'll die. - Hey.

1005
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:16,491
And...

1006
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:18,591
put some oil on your hands beforehand.

1007
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:19,591
(It'll be exciting.)

1008
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,161
I'm sorry.

1009
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,860
(Scared)

1010
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,170
That was risky.

1011
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,270
I haven't heard Seok Jin's scared voice in a long time.

1012
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,610
- This time, - He wants me dead.

1013
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,670
Jong Kook got seriously angry.

1014
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,781
Seok Jin was looking Jong Kook in the eye,

1015
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:35,781
but then...

1016
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:37,250
(Seok Jin lowered his eyes.)

1017
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,781
I can't help it. I'm older than him,

1018
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,480
but I can't help it.

1019
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,721
You'll pretend you're not scared even if you are, right?

1020
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,690
I won't.

1021
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,261
Even if he's scared,

1022
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,190
he'll just say, "This is a bit scary."

1023
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,830
- You're right. - It's not funny at all.

1024
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,391
- Right? - You're right.

1025
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,230
- "This is kind of scary." - "This is a bit scary."

1026
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,000
- "This is scary." - And then, he'll jump.

1027
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,770
- And then, he'll jump. - "This is not easy."

1028
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,471
It's because he's Kim Jong Kook.

1029
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:00,971
- Right? - Right.

1030
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,670
- He has to do it. - It's hard.

1031
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,810
And I'm Haha.

1032
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:06,511
Hey, you.

1033
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:09,080
- This isn't a special about that. - It's driving me crazy.

1034
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,551
- Keep your mouth shut. - Hey!

1035
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:11,851
You should've told me at the end.

1036
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,080
- I can't focus. - Right now...

1037
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,980
I'm about to lose it.

1038
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:17,391
All right.

1039
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,351
I'll play the clip for the second round of Tiger Moth Tour...

1040
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:22,060
Truth Game that the loser of the game will broadcast live on Chuseok.

1041
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,860
- Please put on your earphones. - Wait. This is...

1042
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,991
As you've seen before, look how good Ji Hyo is at this.

1043
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:28,101
- We must be very observant. - I must follow Ji Hyo's decision.

1044
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,301
I'm going to get it right now.

1045
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,330
All right. We'll play the clip now.

1046
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,871
Play the video.

1047
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:33,940
(Who will get the penalty badge?)

1048
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,241
(The 2nd question of Tiger Moth Tour)

1049
00:39:38,241 --> 00:39:40,181
Why did you bring that here?

1050
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,710
You wouldn't even play with it.

1051
00:39:41,781 --> 00:39:43,411
Tell him you'll give him the money and do it again.

1052
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,610
- Kwang Soo... - Can't I get a chance with money?

1053
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,420
I will sell this device.

1054
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,721
(He's selling it rather hurriedly.)

1055
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:50,951
It's expensive.

1056
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:53,360
All right. First off, take out your gaming device.

1057
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,560
- I don't need this. - If that's the case,

1058
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,060
give me five dollars, and I'll give you another chance.

1059
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,761
- Just one. - What do you think? Should we pay?

1060
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:02,601
Pay him, and let's do it again.

1061
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,571
You gave me 2 dollars and 3 dollars.

1062
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:06,031
(They earn another chance after paying 5 dollars.)

1063
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,371
I counted the money, and it's five dollars.

1064
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:09,871
(Let's do well this time.)

1065
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:11,040
- It's So Min's turn. - Okay.

1066
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,681
Take out the gaming device. You might select that again.

1067
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,580
- That's so big. - The controllers...

1068
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,110
(The controllers are separate.)

1069
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,380
- The controllers... - Let me throw it this time.

1070
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,621
I can't take them out?

1071
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,520
- I can take them out too, can't I? - They are part of the device too.

1072
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,761
- I can take them out though. - Take out the device only.

1073
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,020
(What?)

1074
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,860
You could've taken them out together if they were connected.

1075
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:33,330
(Whispering)

1076
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,270
She told me to hit you once.

1077
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,301
(Producer, let me hit you.)

1078
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:40,571
This device has neither the cables nor the controllers.

1079
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,571
The only thing I can do with this is to hit someone.

1080
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,270
(It's heavy.)

1081
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,011
- That's the only thing I can do. - Fine.

1082
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:50,610
- You can take out the controllers. - This is bad.

1083
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,051
- Okay. - We'll let you do that.

1084
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,181
- He ought to exclude them. - That's right.

1085
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,790
Kwang Soo, move. Let me practice.

1086
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,721
(Kwang Soo, move. Let me practice.)

1087
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,721
(Throwing)

1088
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:04,560
Hey.

1089
00:41:05,091 --> 00:41:07,130
What are you doing? I can't exactly go into your room.

1090
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,931
- Come on! - Don't say something like that!

1091
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:12,431
- Your lines are so lame. - No, the rule...

1092
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,871
- It was the rule. - That was terrible.

1093
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,971
- That was the rule of the game. - Your line is disgusting.

1094
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,841
That's the worst line of today.

1095
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:19,411
- It's really disgusting. - What's wrong with you?

1096
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,181
It was like a joke.

1097
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,851
- It was harder than it looked. - What was that?

1098
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,451
(No one is interested in this fleeting romance.)

1099
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,991
- You may start now. - Okay.

1100
00:41:30,351 --> 00:41:32,721
- Let's go. We can do this. - I'll try now.

1101
00:41:33,121 --> 00:41:34,261
Let me try it.

1102
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:35,460
- You'll try it now. - Yes.

1103
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:40,801
(She desperately needs toiletries to wash away her long day.)

1104
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:43,500
(Will her coin land on the toiletries?)

1105
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,301
(It did land on something.)

1106
00:41:45,301 --> 00:41:46,371
Where did it go?

1107
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,571
Where is it?

1108
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,270
(It lands on top of the padded vest.)

1109
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,080
- It fell here. - It did fall on top of that.

1110
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,380
They aren't clothes.

1111
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,980
- It's your padded vest. - What is this?

1112
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,221
- Why did you bring it to Indonesia? - I mean...

1113
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,051
I wrapped the gaming device with this to avoid breaking it.

1114
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:04,221
(I didn't have bubble wraps.)

1115
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,020
I didn't bring this to wear.

1116
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,931
- Congratulations. - I wrapped the device with this.

1117
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,591
You think I'm crazy? Why would I bring this...

1118
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:14,460
- to Indonesia? - This is a duck down vest.

1119
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,500
(It looks warm.)

1120
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,571
This isn't the end. Aren't you hungry?

1121
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,170
- Why don't you have your meal? - Goodness.

1122
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:22,471
What do I wear tomorrow then?

1123
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,670
Wear this.

1124
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:25,571
I don't need this.

1125
00:42:25,571 --> 00:42:28,011
(They head to the restaurant with the warm, padded vest.)

1126
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,650
Hey, what time was that?

1127
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,181
Gosh, you were on a tight schedule.

1128
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,310
We were just starting.

1129
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,851
(They began their journey at 9am, but the current time is 11pm.)

1130
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:36,721
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes.

1131
00:42:36,721 --> 00:42:39,420
We'll start the mission for your dinner.

1132
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:43,431
How many games did you play?

1133
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:44,991
- The whole day is over. - It's only the beginning.

1134
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:46,900
There's a mission for dinner?

1135
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,661
- I'm so sick of missions. - Before...

1136
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,571
Currently, you're carrying out the penalty in Indonesia.

1137
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:53,400
- You said we'll rest. - We even played...

1138
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,601
games from the flight to Indonesia because she wanted to play games.

1139
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:58,210
Did I hear it wrong? He said we'll have to do a mission?

1140
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,741
We're going to start a mission for your dinner.

1141
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:03,880
Take out an item that you need from your luggage.

1142
00:43:03,911 --> 00:43:05,080
It's the luggage again.

1143
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:06,551
- The luggage? - Take out an item...

1144
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,980
- from the luggage. - Just one?

1145
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,121
(It's a special chance for them.)

1146
00:43:09,121 --> 00:43:11,991
(They take out an item they need from their luggage.)

1147
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,960
Take out only one item.

1148
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,920
- Will you take out toiletries? - Yes.

1149
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:17,891
I got mine.

1150
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:20,730
- You took out your toiletries. - Yes.

1151
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,201
- What about you, So Min? - Wait, no.

1152
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,801
I should take out the outfit for tomorrow.

1153
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,701
I can't take out the whole outfit?

1154
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:26,801
(A whole outfit)

1155
00:43:26,801 --> 00:43:28,141
- Should I allow that? - Yes, please.

1156
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,411
- But that's not fair. - So...

1157
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:33,281
I'm okay with that, but the viewers might think it's unfair.

1158
00:43:33,281 --> 00:43:34,411
Hey, shut your mouth.

1159
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,351
It looks like he's favoring you.

1160
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:40,621
Just take out one item that you really need.

1161
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,781
Pants.

1162
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,520
Pants. Which one should I wear?

1163
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,761
(She's seriously worried.)

1164
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:48,591
They look the same. Why are you thinking about this?

1165
00:43:48,661 --> 00:43:50,661
- No, they're different. - What?

1166
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,400
- They're different. - I thought you had the same pants.

1167
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,701
How are they different? Even the lengths are the same.

1168
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:58,270
This pair has buttons, and this pair has a zipper.

1169
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,241
This is a high-waist pair.

1170
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,601
But no one will know about the buttons or the zipper except you.

1171
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,670
Please choose one for me.

1172
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,440
(Stop talking, and choose one.)

1173
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,580
That one.

1174
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,480
- This one? This? Okay. - Yes.

1175
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,911
(She chose a pair of pants with buttons for tomorrow.)

1176
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,020
All right.

1177
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,951
It does look like they're on their honeymoon.

1178
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,391
You'll have your meal soon. Bring the food in, please.

1179
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:20,591
(It's time for dinner they've been waiting for.)

1180
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
- Thank you. This looks tasty. - What is that?

1181
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,431
Your dinner will be a traditional dish of Indonesia.

1182
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:28,101
This is Indonesian stir-fried rice, nasi goreng.

1183
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:29,931
I know this dish.

1184
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:32,371
And this is called ikan gurame.

1185
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:34,341
This is made with a fish called gurame.

1186
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,071
I see. This is a gurame.

1187
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,071
All right. You can...

1188
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,181
only eat this through your decisions.

1189
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,810
Your choice, the mission for your dinner.

1190
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:46,451
Will you choose the item you need?

1191
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:49,380
Or will you choose delicious dishes to fill your empty stomach?

1192
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:55,360
(Will they choose the item they need or the food to fill their hunger?)

1193
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,230
Depending on your choices, you can get either the item or food.

1194
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,031
To be honest, I'm hungry.

1195
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,531
This is a new way of stressing me out.

1196
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,670
(To wash or to eat.)

1197
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,040
This isn't a team mission, is it?

1198
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,571
- She can choose the pants or this. - That's correct.

1199
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:11,511
I can choose either the toiletries or the food.

1200
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:15,110
I'll choose the pants. You should choose the food and share it.

1201
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,181
You want us to share?

1202
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,351
I'll choose the toiletries. Or you can pay me two dollars.

1203
00:45:19,721 --> 00:45:21,380
Give me two dollars in exchange. Or this deal is off.

1204
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:22,551
Okay. Hurry.

1205
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,020
- We don't have time. I'm hungry. - Let's rock-paper-scissors.

1206
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,790
- And then what? - The loser will pay two dollars.

1207
00:45:27,621 --> 00:45:30,330
- The loser can make a choice. - If I lose,

1208
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,460
I'll give you two dollars and take my toiletries.

1209
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,931
- And we share the food. I'm in. - Yes.

1210
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:35,400
Rock-paper-scissors.

1211
00:45:35,601 --> 00:45:37,531
(So Min wins.)

1212
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,400
Give me two dollars. Give it to me.

1213
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:43,641
- I'll save up 30 dollars like this. - I have to take out a loan soon.

1214
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,371
And it'd be better for me to buy the items.

1215
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,210
- Give me my two dollars. - What's happening now?

1216
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,110
I'll choose the stir-fried rice.

1217
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:51,980
Then I'll choose the toiletries, okay?

1218
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,051
All right.

1219
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,551
- We'll take out the pants. - Okay.

1220
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:56,650
I chose the toiletries.

1221
00:45:57,051 --> 00:45:58,391
I used up all of the singles.

1222
00:45:58,391 --> 00:45:59,721
(Kwang Soo pays 2 dollars.)

1223
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,360
Try this. This is good.

1224
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,520
(A tasty dish brings peace to them.)

1225
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,960
I think this is a spicy pepper.

1226
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,560
- Was it good? - It was so good.

1227
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,761
- It's really tasty. - This is delicious.

1228
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:13,071
- It smells great. - It's like it's their honeymoon.

1229
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:14,540
- But they don't like each other. - It's good.

1230
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:16,040
- They were forced to get married. - Exactly.

1231
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,641
(They're quiet at last. They're finally in peace.)

1232
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:19,980
I really like the rice.

1233
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,281
I like how dry it is.

1234
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,810
- You like it dry? - Isn't it tasty?

1235
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,951
What do people call this kind of rice?

1236
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,080
(He's referring to Annam rice.)

1237
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,891
- Wasn't the rice offered to Buddha? - No, that wasn't it.

1238
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:32,920
(There he turns into a klutz again.)

1239
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,020
That's from the story of Simcheong, and she offered 300 rice bags.

1240
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:36,360
Oh, right.

1241
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,230
You're going to lend me the cleansing foam, right?

1242
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,230
(I'm sharing my food.)

1243
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,871
Why aren't you answering me?

1244
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,371
- You'll let me borrow it, right? - For a dollar.

1245
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:49,911
- No. - For a dollar.

1246
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:51,871
- You ate my food. - What are you doing?

1247
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,610
You're eating my food, and you also took the toiletries.

1248
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,741
It's so hard to meddle with you right now.

1249
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:58,150
I hate this power struggle with you.

1250
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,621
Promise me in front of the cameras.

1251
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:00,920
That you're going to lend me your cleansing foam.

1252
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:02,181
For a dollar,

1253
00:47:03,551 --> 00:47:04,851
I'll lend you the toothbrush and cleansing foam.

1254
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:07,420
Then stop eating. Don't eat.

1255
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,690
Didn't I pay for this fair and square? I gave you two dollars.

1256
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,400
This is so interesting. What is this?

1257
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,571
(I can't hear anything.)

1258
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,330
For a dollar, I'll lend you a toothbrush, toothpaste,

1259
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:19,641
shampoo, and conditioner.

1260
00:47:20,071 --> 00:47:21,170
I can't give you more than these.

1261
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,011
- You get shampoo and conditioner. - Then take just a spoonful.

1262
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,940
Goodness.

1263
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,241
(How can she be so mean? Who is this girl?)

1264
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,451
You made a promise. Have your spoonful, and give up.

1265
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,150
Eat up.

1266
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,781
Fine.

1267
00:47:38,221 --> 00:47:40,520
(Gobbling up)

1268
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:44,830
(I'll only have a mouthful.)

1269
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,830
(He eats every grain of leftover rice on the plate.)

1270
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,971
Don't you think this is too much?

1271
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,341
Give me 50 cents.

1272
00:47:58,071 --> 00:47:59,471
You ate 50-cents' worth of food. Give me 50 cents.

1273
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,040
That would be 50 cents.

1274
00:48:01,911 --> 00:48:03,080
I won't give you the money.

1275
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,150
- Why? - I had a change of heart.

1276
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:06,420
(He changes his attitude.)

1277
00:48:06,721 --> 00:48:09,221
(Why?)

1278
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:11,121
I didn't say out loud that I was going to pay you.

1279
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,761
(He is true to his reputation.)

1280
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:15,460
I don't need to pay you, and I won't lend you the toiletries.

1281
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:21,060
(Now that he's been fed, he's feeling sleepy.)

1282
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:22,130
Excuse me?

1283
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:24,571
Excuse me?

1284
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,630
(What a jerk.)

1285
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,601
Give me water, please.

1286
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,270
Water, please.

1287
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:33,181
(He's very satisfied with the stir-fried rice.)

1288
00:48:33,181 --> 00:48:34,380
This is good.

1289
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:36,451
Give me. You said you'll give me the money.

1290
00:48:36,451 --> 00:48:37,911
I got you on the cameras.

1291
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:39,580
It's a promise you made with your fans in Indonesia.

1292
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:40,821
No matter how hard...

1293
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,891
Why are you bringing my fans into this?

1294
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,920
This is a promise with all those fans at the airport.

1295
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,290
(We believe in you, Kwang Soo.)

1296
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:50,591
As the Prince of Asia...

1297
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:52,091
You're talking trash.

1298
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:53,931
What on earth are you saying?

1299
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,161
Keep your promise.

1300
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:56,730
(The first meal of Tiger Moth Tour ends with them fighting.)

1301
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,330
You may go to your rooms now.

1302
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,471
(It's 1:30am.)

1303
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,871
After you get some sleep,

1304
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:03,971
we'll go to Indonesian Manual Wooden Cable Car at last.

1305
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,110
(They go to Manual Wooden Cable Car tomorrow.)

1306
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:07,141
- Do you have... - I'm not surprised.

1307
00:49:07,141 --> 00:49:09,281
any good news? We heard nothing good today.

1308
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,681
That's why we have good news.

1309
00:49:12,681 --> 00:49:14,420
(Good news?)

1310
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:18,020
You're given one more chance to open the luggage.

1311
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,761
Here's your second mission to open the luggage.

1312
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:23,161
It's called It's 4am, Not 4pm.

1313
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:25,060
(It's 4am, Not 4pm)

1314
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,161
(In Indonesia, it's 4am, Not 4pm?)

1315
00:49:29,531 --> 00:49:30,801
(Was the rhyme intentional?)

1316
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,931
"It's 4am, Not 4pm"?

1317
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:33,940
- Isn't it incredible? - What a great punch line.

1318
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:36,841
You mean the good news is...

1319
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,940
you allowing me to take...

1320
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:43,110
one item out of so many from my luggage?

1321
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:46,351
(He's speechless.)

1322
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:48,781
Can you just give back my luggage? It's ridiculous.

1323
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:51,750
How could you...

1324
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,460
Here's the mission called It's 4am, Not 4pm.

1325
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:57,031
When it's 4am in Indonesia,

1326
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,690
it's 6am in Korea.

1327
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:01,560
- Right. - Call other members at that time...

1328
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,471
to proceed the mission.

1329
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,871
You may call any member.

1330
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,400
You fail immediately if you hear any assigned taboo words.

1331
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,380
You get a chance to open the luggage if you succeed.

1332
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,341
The taboo words you have to avoid...

1333
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:18,411
will be given at 4am at the corridor on the 5th floor.

1334
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:20,781
Have a good night.

1335
00:50:20,781 --> 00:50:21,821
(They get three hours of sleep.)

1336
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:25,351
(He's speechless again.)

1337
00:50:25,351 --> 00:50:27,290
Look how sad I look.

1338
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,721
(She tears up.)

1339
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:29,960
You just look sleepy.

1340
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,460
Go to bed now.

1341
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,301
- Go to bed. - How can I sleep without changing?

1342
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,301
Keep these clothes on.

1343
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,670
Is that all?

1344
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,471
Will you give them to me?

1345
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:42,741
- I'm sorry. - I need to wash up.

1346
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:45,170
- I don't have much. - I must brush teeth for your sake.

1347
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,241
- That's why... - It's okay.

1348
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,351
I won't talk much with you tomorrow.

1349
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:51,851
(He won't talk to her tomorrow.)

1350
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:54,451
Let's go.

1351
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,951
(You're watching Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour.)

1352
00:50:57,150 --> 00:51:00,790
The mission starts at 4am. It must be 1am then.

1353
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,330
We had to clear another mission after three hours.

1354
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:05,690
- It was terrible. - We had no food or sleep.

1355
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,730
- We couldn't even wash. - We couldn't sleep.

1356
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,801
We can tell from your facial expression.

1357
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,031
It's horrible in Indonesia.

1358
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:13,841
It must be worse for Nevis Swing.

1359
00:51:14,241 --> 00:51:16,170
- We won't go. - I can imagine.

1360
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:17,770
No way.

1361
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:20,610
(He sighs.)

1362
00:51:21,241 --> 00:51:22,310
(They go into their separate rooms.)

1363
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,451
- Here it is. - Lend me your foam cleanser.

1364
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:27,020
- Please? - This is what I earned.

1365
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,020
I have to wash my hair.

1366
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,621
(She begs Kwang Soo.)

1367
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:31,750
Please, Kwang Soo.

1368
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,491
I'll lend you the game console.

1369
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,261
What can I do with this? May I sell it?

1370
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:39,091
What's this?

1371
00:51:40,661 --> 00:51:42,000
May I sell it?

1372
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,371
(He finds something on the game controller.)

1373
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:46,230
- It's the slime monster. - It is.

1374
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,670
It's everywhere.

1375
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:50,610
It's on all of my items.

1376
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,440
Please, Kwang Soo.

1377
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,810
I beg you, Kwang Soo.

1378
00:51:55,511 --> 00:51:56,911
- What? - Foam cleanser.

1379
00:51:57,551 --> 00:52:00,580
(She begs for his foam cleanser.)

1380
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,951
(Kwang Soo decides to be generous after she begs desperately.)

1381
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,790
- Don't give it to me now. - Take it now.

1382
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,020
How can I use it later?

1383
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:10,690
(He gives her the foam cleaner on her hand.)

1384
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,391
There isn't even much left.

1385
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,871
(She sighs.)

1386
00:52:18,971 --> 00:52:21,571
How can I use it if you give it to me all at once?

1387
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,940
- Keep it somewhere. - Where?

1388
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,871
What can I do with it?

1389
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:27,380
I can only give it to you now.

1390
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,810
I don't have a place to store it.

1391
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:30,150
- Give me a plastic bag. - I'll do it carefully.

1392
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,851
- They will get mixed. - Let me do it.

1393
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:33,750
- They will get mixed. - What's this?

1394
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,750
(What is this?)

1395
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,121
- It's the slime monster. - Why is it here?

1396
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:41,121
(The slime monster is everywhere.)

1397
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:43,230
I never opened the bag. How did it get in here?

1398
00:52:43,431 --> 00:52:45,690
- It's the slime monster. - Is it a real monster?

1399
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,761
(What's it made of?)

1400
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
- Why is it here? - Where did it come from?

1401
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,531
I don't know.

1402
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,040
Is the monster alive? I keep finding more.

1403
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:57,341
Seriously.

1404
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,940
- What else can I do? - I can't use it if you give it now.

1405
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:02,110
Give me a lot of conditioner.

1406
00:53:02,911 --> 00:53:04,650
Give me more. I have long hair.

1407
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,520
- I have long hair too. - My hair is longer.

1408
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,880
(They argue about hair length.)

1409
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,721
I'll help you later.

1410
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,960
Give me more. That's enough only for the tip of my hair.

1411
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,391
I need to wash the back.

1412
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,860
Use the soap. I don't have much left.

1413
00:53:18,091 --> 00:53:19,830
There's no soap either.

1414
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:21,601
Hey, stop it.

1415
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:22,830
(They argue over little things.)

1416
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:24,770
Give me some toothpaste.

1417
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:26,670
Are we prisoners?

1418
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,000
- What are we doing? - Are we prisoners?

1419
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,571
What's the reason? Is this necessary?

1420
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,641
You're on Indonesia Tiger Moth Tour to be penalized.

1421
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,181
Are they on "The Law of Jungle"?

1422
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,580
It's terrible.

1423
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,681
(Around 4am)

1424
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:42,051
It was so tiring.

1425
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,591
(2 minutes before 4am)

1426
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:49,360
Hello.

1427
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:51,891
- What time is it over there? - She looks like a frog.

1428
00:53:51,891 --> 00:53:52,960
It's 4am.

1429
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,560
- My face was swollen. - She looks like a frog.

1430
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,960
(What's going on?)

1431
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,571
Hello.

1432
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,440
He's a ghost in the subway.

1433
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,310
He looks like a wrestler.

1434
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:08,880
Current time 4:01am.

1435
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:10,411
(It's 6am in Korea.)

1436
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,821
The luggage in the 7th floor lobby is open.

1437
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,621
- Pardon me? - You may not go.

1438
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:19,290
The member to clear the mission...

1439
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,060
may take...

1440
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:25,330
the items of his or her choice in the black bag.

1441
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,701
(Pack your items in the black bag.)

1442
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:28,130
Is this necessary?

1443
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,770
Just give me my things.

1444
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,701
Please.

1445
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:36,571
You may move once you get another member on the phone.

1446
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:39,040
You must keep them on the line until you take your items.

1447
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:41,980
You aren't allowed to tell them not to hang up.

1448
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,951
You fail the mission if the other says the taboo words.

1449
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:45,951
(The other must not say the taboo words.)

1450
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:47,750
He can't say the taboo words or hang up?

1451
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:48,821
Right.

1452
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:53,690
The taboo words are "Let me sleep" or "I'm going to sleep."

1453
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,721
Please start the mission.

1454
00:54:57,391 --> 00:55:00,500
(So Min tries calling someone right away.)

1455
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,301
- Hello? - Se Chan.

1456
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,040
I had an event,

1457
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,971
so I was at the airport back then.

1458
00:55:10,971 --> 00:55:12,841
- I see. - It's me.

1459
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,011
(She gets lucky.)

1460
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,141
Hello, So Min.

1461
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,480
(She must prolong the call.)

1462
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,781
- What's up? - Se Chan.

1463
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:20,480
By the way...

1464
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:23,621
Can you sing me a song?

1465
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,690
(She asks for a song.)

1466
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,020
What? A song?

1467
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,591
Can you sing me a song?

1468
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,190
(She asks him to sing at 6am.)

1469
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:32,230
- Are you drunk? - No, I'm not.

1470
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,360
(She sounds drunk.)

1471
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,500
What's going on?

1472
00:55:35,261 --> 00:55:37,571
I thought she was drunk. She kept saying nonsense.

1473
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,971
It'd be funny if Se Chan said something strange.

1474
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,701
(I couldn't sleep at the thought of you.)

1475
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:43,871
I'd be in trouble.

1476
00:55:44,871 --> 00:55:47,380
I'll call Seok Jin first.

1477
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,880
(He calls Seok Jin.)

1478
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,321
- Did you call me? - Seok Jin wouldn't pick up.

1479
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:55,650
- I bet he's sleeping. - I couldn't answer.

1480
00:55:55,951 --> 00:55:58,051
(He's not helpful at all.)

1481
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,351
How about Jae Seok?

1482
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:00,790
(He calls Jae Seok next.)

1483
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,661
(Will diligent Jae Seok pick up?)

1484
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,560
- I couldn't hear the phone ring. - You couldn't?

1485
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,830
You called me back.

1486
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,360
I called you back later.

1487
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,500
I think he's sleeping. I'll try Se Chan.

1488
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,371
The number you have dialed is busy.

1489
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,701
It must be So Min.

1490
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,940
- Hello? - Se Chan.

1491
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,040
(She enters the 7th floor lobby.)

1492
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,741
Can you sing me a song please?

1493
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:26,721
- Are you drunk? - No I'm not.

1494
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:29,281
Why would I drink at work?

1495
00:56:30,091 --> 00:56:31,790
It's so out of the blue.

1496
00:56:31,951 --> 00:56:36,221
It's because I suddenly missed you.

1497
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:38,630
What time is it over there?

1498
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:41,360
Can you sing me a song?

1499
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,701
He's such a gentleman.

1500
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:45,471
- What? - You have a good voice.

1501
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:46,641
(You have a good voice, Se Chan.)

1502
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,440
Right now,

1503
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,770
I'm tired.

1504
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:58,051
I can't sing for you now.

1505
00:56:58,851 --> 00:56:59,920
Really?

1506
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,721
He was close to saying the words.

1507
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:04,290
- Normally... - Are you on a mission?

1508
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,491
(She has to hurry before he hangs up!)

1509
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:07,190
- Are you on a mission? - Me?

1510
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,830
- Yes. - No, I'm not.

1511
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,431
- It's not that. - Really?

1512
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:15,031
Excuse me, but where are my pants with buttons?

1513
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,101
You took them from me.

1514
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,170
It's nothing.

1515
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,571
(Meanwhile...)

1516
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,040
I'll call Haha.

1517
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,071
(He tries to call Haha this time.)

1518
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,310
- He wouldn't pick up. - Of course not.

1519
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:30,480
- He would be sleeping. - He's sleeping.

1520
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,150
He wouldn't pick up.

1521
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,150
Why does everyone sleep so much?

1522
00:57:38,821 --> 00:57:41,460
I'll try Jong Kook. He recently finished a project.

1523
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,261
(He failed again.)

1524
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,431
I heard the phone ringing, but I didn't pick up.

1525
00:57:50,431 --> 00:57:51,431
Really?

1526
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:52,900
Who would anyone be up at 6am?

1527
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,801
When he calls me early in the morning, he's usually drunk.

1528
00:57:55,801 --> 00:57:57,571
That's why I don't pick up any calls at that time.

1529
00:57:57,571 --> 00:57:59,040
(Kwang Soo likes drunk dialing.)

1530
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:00,540
(Sad)

1531
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,610
(Why don't you try calling Ji Hyo?)

1532
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:03,181
Why don't you try calling Ji Hyo?

1533
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:05,051
She'd be sleeping anyway.

1534
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,821
(She's only awake in the afternoon.)

1535
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,321
She's definitely sleeping.

1536
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,860
(He tries calling Ji Hyo as his last hope.)

1537
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:17,460
- Change the caller ringtone please. - Okay.

1538
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,661
- She's had it for four years. - I'm tired of it.

1539
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:24,696
- Kwang Soo. - Ji Hyo.

1540
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:26,035
(She's awake at this hour?)

1541
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:27,305
- Yes? - Why are you awake?

1542
00:58:29,136 --> 00:58:30,705
I'm with someone.

1543
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:33,176
- What? - Where are you?

1544
00:58:33,705 --> 00:58:34,906
I'm in Indonesia.

1545
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,375
Where in Indonesia are you? I'm in Indonesia too.

1546
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:40,145
Right. You're in Indonesia too, right?

1547
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,515
- You were in Indonesia? - She was in Indonesia too.

1548
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:43,585
- Really? - Really?

1549
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:45,455
- That's unbelievable. - You had a shoot?

1550
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:47,455
Really?

1551
00:58:48,426 --> 00:58:49,886
I was so surprised.

1552
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:52,855
I have to go. We've been talking for eight minutes.

1553
00:58:54,066 --> 00:58:55,165
Are you hanging up on me?

1554
00:58:55,926 --> 00:58:58,196
Bye. I have to go.

1555
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,265
Really? Okay.

1556
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:02,035
(Kwang Soo appears.)

1557
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:03,066
I mean...

1558
00:59:03,736 --> 00:59:05,535
- Bye. - How long will you be here?

1559
00:59:05,736 --> 00:59:06,846
Bye.

1560
00:59:09,406 --> 00:59:11,645
- Really? - Sorry?

1561
00:59:11,645 --> 00:59:14,245
Is this all the hats? I brought more.

1562
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:15,886
(Kwang Soo has to buy time.)

1563
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,955
- Hey. - Who is it?

1564
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:19,515
Did you have breakfast?

1565
00:59:20,355 --> 00:59:21,426
Who is it?

1566
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,225
Did you have breakfast?

1567
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:26,895
Aren't you tired?

1568
00:59:26,895 --> 00:59:28,395
Get some sleep.

1569
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:29,895
Hey.

1570
00:59:29,895 --> 00:59:30,966
Ji Hyo.

1571
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:34,406
(Kwang Soo is angry.)

1572
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:37,935
He looks seriously angry.

1573
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,875
I don't remember it.

1574
00:59:39,875 --> 00:59:41,276
- That's hilarious. - I don't remember it.

1575
00:59:41,475 --> 00:59:44,375
Why are you awake at this hour?

1576
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,776
Aren't you tired?

1577
00:59:45,776 --> 00:59:47,946
She's okay. Her voice sounds fine.

1578
00:59:47,946 --> 00:59:50,555
I'll call you soon.

1579
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:52,285
Ji Hyo.

1580
00:59:52,855 --> 00:59:55,125
(Kwang Soo focuses on moving the stuff.)

1581
00:59:55,185 --> 00:59:56,386
It fits.

1582
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:58,696
So Min is calling me.

1583
00:59:58,696 --> 01:00:00,495
- Don't get it. She's drunk. - Please answer it.

1584
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:03,796
- She's drunk. - Ji Hyo.

1585
01:00:03,796 --> 01:00:04,895
(I'm not drunk.)

1586
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:06,835
- She's drunk. - I thought she really was drunk.

1587
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:09,506
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1588
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:11,176
Ji Hyo.

1589
01:00:12,375 --> 01:00:15,205
Ji Hyo, this is So Min.

1590
01:00:15,576 --> 01:00:18,276
(So Min is talking to Ji Hyo?)

1591
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:20,085
- She hung up on me. - This is So Min.

1592
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:22,816
Why are you awake?

1593
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:26,285
It's too late. Go to bed.

1594
01:00:26,316 --> 01:00:27,355
(I still have a lot left.)

1595
01:00:27,355 --> 01:00:28,355
Call me later.

1596
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:33,026
You're definitely going to Australia.

1597
01:00:33,026 --> 01:00:34,026
(So Min, I'm taking you to Australia.)

1598
01:00:34,826 --> 01:00:36,265
(After three hours of war,)

1599
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,296
(the penalty day starts.)

1600
01:00:37,296 --> 01:00:38,296
Good morning.

1601
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:39,995
(After three hours of war, the penalty day starts.)

1602
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:41,366
Aren't we jumping today?

1603
01:00:41,366 --> 01:00:43,475
(We should teleport.)

1604
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:45,205
Let's jump to the cable car.

1605
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:46,745
- To the cable car? - Yes.

1606
01:00:46,745 --> 01:00:47,745
Isn't it...

1607
01:00:48,906 --> 01:00:49,906
Let's try.

1608
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:53,076
Please use the best one.

1609
01:00:53,076 --> 01:00:54,085
(We'll jump many times.)

1610
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:55,245
1, 2, 3.

1611
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:00,955
- They used it. - You used it.

1612
01:01:00,955 --> 01:01:02,055
I'm touched.

1613
01:01:02,055 --> 01:01:03,055
(I'm really touched.)

1614
01:01:03,656 --> 01:01:04,796
1, 2, 3.

1615
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,765
(They succeeded after 7 tries.)

1616
01:01:08,066 --> 01:01:10,495
- This is fun. - We're inside now.

1617
01:01:10,495 --> 01:01:12,265
This is fun.

1618
01:01:15,165 --> 01:01:17,335
Was it really necessary?

1619
01:01:17,335 --> 01:01:18,475
(They can't teleport anymore.)

1620
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,475
Are we going to keep doing it?

1621
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,705
(They'll move by a car from now.)

1622
01:01:21,046 --> 01:01:23,276
It's getting a bit boring, right?

1623
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,076
We'll give you a mission where you can win additional fees.

1624
01:01:26,076 --> 01:01:27,886
Additional fees? We don't have to pay to play, right?

1625
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:30,285
- You'll compete with each other. - Okay.

1626
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,986
We'll compete with each other? That'd be weird.

1627
01:01:33,486 --> 01:01:34,986
I'm ready for anything.

1628
01:01:35,386 --> 01:01:39,696
I'll give you a quiz on Indonesia.

1629
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:42,526
- On Indonesia? - If you say the right answer,

1630
01:01:42,596 --> 01:01:44,165
you'll get five dollars.

1631
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:45,196
- Five dollars? Okay. - Okay.

1632
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,906
Here goes the question.

1633
01:01:47,335 --> 01:01:49,006
In Indonesia,

1634
01:01:49,535 --> 01:01:53,035
you should not touch a certain body part of a child.

1635
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,475
- Which part is it? - What about adults?

1636
01:01:56,076 --> 01:01:57,816
(Thinking)

1637
01:01:57,816 --> 01:01:59,346
Let me answer. Are there options?

1638
01:02:00,245 --> 01:02:01,245
No, there aren't.

1639
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:02,986
- Let me answer. - I was faster.

1640
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:03,986
The head.

1641
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,386
(Which part of a child's body should you not touch in Indonesia?)

1642
01:02:05,386 --> 01:02:07,926
- The head? - Yes, including hair.

1643
01:02:08,156 --> 01:02:09,585
- Correct. - Wait.

1644
01:02:10,426 --> 01:02:12,995
We'll give you the money later.

1645
01:02:13,725 --> 01:02:15,966
Indonesians consider the head sacred.

1646
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,696
If you touch someone's head,

1647
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:19,535
they think you're intruding into his or her soul's shelter.

1648
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:20,605
- You knew the answer? - Yes.

1649
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:22,165
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

1650
01:02:22,165 --> 01:02:24,305
It's even worse to touch the head with your left hand, right?

1651
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:25,875
No. Is that correct?

1652
01:02:26,006 --> 01:02:27,946
- Is it true? - If you touch the head...

1653
01:02:27,946 --> 01:02:31,046
with your left hand, it's unacceptable.

1654
01:02:31,316 --> 01:02:32,346
Exactly.

1655
01:02:32,846 --> 01:02:35,685
You should never touch children's heads, thinking they're adorable.

1656
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,055
You really knew it.

1657
01:02:37,285 --> 01:02:40,756
Anyway, So Min won five dollars for question number 1.

1658
01:02:40,756 --> 01:02:41,756
Right.

1659
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,526
Here goes the next question.

1660
01:02:43,526 --> 01:02:46,256
I'm getting serious. I'm serious.

1661
01:02:46,256 --> 01:02:47,296
(The second question)

1662
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,395
In Indonesia,

1663
01:02:49,895 --> 01:02:52,796
how do girls greet...

1664
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:54,506
each other?

1665
01:02:54,506 --> 01:02:55,506
Let me answer.

1666
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:58,776
They pretend they kiss the other on the cheek.

1667
01:02:58,776 --> 01:03:00,906
Isn't that the French way?

1668
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:04,515
(Isn't that the French way?)

1669
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:05,776
You're such a know-it-all.

1670
01:03:07,846 --> 01:03:09,285
- Correct. - Yes!

1671
01:03:09,415 --> 01:03:10,486
What?

1672
01:03:11,515 --> 01:03:12,515
They kiss the other on the cheek.

1673
01:03:12,515 --> 01:03:13,785
(Kwang Soo wins five dollars.)

1674
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:16,685
I think I've seen it.

1675
01:03:16,685 --> 01:03:17,696
- It gave me the chills. - How?

1676
01:03:17,696 --> 01:03:18,696
Like this?

1677
01:03:19,256 --> 01:03:22,665
(What are you doing?)

1678
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,035
It's called cipika cipiki.

1679
01:03:24,035 --> 01:03:25,136
- Cipika? - Cipika?

1680
01:03:25,395 --> 01:03:26,696
- Cipika. - Cipika cipiki.

1681
01:03:26,696 --> 01:03:27,835
- Cipika cipiki. - Cipika cipiki.

1682
01:03:28,236 --> 01:03:29,705
What about between a guy and a girl?

1683
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:30,705
(I'm suddenly curious.)

1684
01:03:30,705 --> 01:03:32,406
- They don't do it. - That's what...

1685
01:03:32,406 --> 01:03:33,946
they'll decide by themselves.

1686
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:35,975
I'm just curious.

1687
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:38,316
The next question is about a gesture.

1688
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,875
I'll make a certain gesture.

1689
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:43,756
Guess what it means in Indonesia.

1690
01:03:44,515 --> 01:03:45,585
Here we go.

1691
01:03:45,716 --> 01:03:48,326
(What does this gesture mean in Indonesia?)

1692
01:03:48,326 --> 01:03:49,355
Let me answer.

1693
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:51,026
You're stopping your sweat...

1694
01:03:51,725 --> 01:03:53,256
from going into your eyes.

1695
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:55,725
Stopping your sweat from going into your eyes?

1696
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:57,535
- Wrong. - Why do you know so much?

1697
01:03:57,535 --> 01:03:58,765
It must have been close.

1698
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:00,935
- It wasn't close at all. - No.

1699
01:04:01,136 --> 01:04:02,935
- He was just teasing me. - Did you make a deal?

1700
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:04,506
(What does this gesture mean in Indonesia?)

1701
01:04:04,506 --> 01:04:06,236
"Stop it."

1702
01:04:06,236 --> 01:04:07,576
- Wrong. - Let me answer.

1703
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:08,875
(Wrong)

1704
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:09,906
Go to the left.

1705
01:04:09,906 --> 01:04:11,616
(Go to the left.)

1706
01:04:11,645 --> 01:04:12,776
Wrong.

1707
01:04:12,776 --> 01:04:15,486
Let me answer. "Don't come here."

1708
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:18,955
- Wrong. - "I'm drunk."

1709
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:21,125
"You're stupid."

1710
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:22,285
"You're stupid."

1711
01:04:22,285 --> 01:04:24,196
It doesn't have a good meaning.

1712
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:25,455
Let me answer.

1713
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,026
"Get lost."

1714
01:04:27,326 --> 01:04:28,665
- I was going to say that too. - Wrong.

1715
01:04:28,696 --> 01:04:29,866
I thought the same.

1716
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:31,566
It doesn't have a good meaning?

1717
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:33,705
In Korea, we do this.

1718
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:35,535
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1719
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,375
No.

1720
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,205
"You're nuts."

1721
01:04:40,245 --> 01:04:41,576
Please use proper words.

1722
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:43,846
- Let me answer. "A crazy person". - "A crazy girl".

1723
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,375
- "A crazy person". - "A crazy girl".

1724
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:46,785
The correct answer is, "A crazy person".

1725
01:04:46,785 --> 01:04:50,316
(Kwang Soo wins 5 dollars.)

1726
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:52,756
You have to say, "Let me answer" first.

1727
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,756
The producer...

1728
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:56,455
didn't say you could answer.

1729
01:04:56,455 --> 01:04:57,756
I was faster.

1730
01:04:57,826 --> 01:05:01,765
- Why did you let him cheat? - Cheat?

1731
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:04,596
You took the money without permission too.

1732
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:05,796
You didn't have the permission.

1733
01:05:05,796 --> 01:05:07,265
But I gave you my stuff.

1734
01:05:07,665 --> 01:05:09,466
Do you expect me to do everything your way?

1735
01:05:09,966 --> 01:05:11,506
How much do you expect me to give up?

1736
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:12,776
Can't you be more generous?

1737
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,946
(They're arguing like real siblings.)

1738
01:05:14,946 --> 01:05:16,046
You're going to Australia with me.

1739
01:05:16,046 --> 01:05:17,745
(You're going to the crocodile cage.)

1740
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:20,316
(You're a crazy person.)

1741
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:24,316
(They touch each other's head with their left hands.)

1742
01:05:24,316 --> 01:05:28,685
(They insult each other in the Indonesian way.)

1743
01:05:28,685 --> 01:05:31,225
You're both out of your mind.

1744
01:05:31,225 --> 01:05:33,526
- You two are crazy. - But you're cute together.

1745
01:05:34,395 --> 01:05:37,696
Here goes the second mission.

1746
01:05:37,696 --> 01:05:38,835
It's pretty simple.

1747
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,506
It's Kwang Soo's favorite, roulette.

1748
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:42,205
What's my favorite?

1749
01:05:42,335 --> 01:05:44,475
Both of you will spin two wheels.

1750
01:05:44,875 --> 01:05:46,335
The 1st wheel has numbers 1 to 8 on it.

1751
01:05:46,335 --> 01:05:48,276
The other one has plus and minus signs on it.

1752
01:05:49,046 --> 01:05:52,176
The numbers determine how much you will get.

1753
01:05:52,745 --> 01:05:56,386
If I get a minus sign, do I lose money?

1754
01:05:56,415 --> 01:05:58,156
- We'll take it away. - And...

1755
01:05:58,156 --> 01:06:00,785
you can even end up with a minus amount, right?

1756
01:06:01,486 --> 01:06:02,955
(So Min gives it a try.)

1757
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:04,156
I should pick a good number.

1758
01:06:04,156 --> 01:06:05,196
The number is not important.

1759
01:06:05,426 --> 01:06:06,725
1, 2, 3.

1760
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,966
It doesn't make any sound.

1761
01:06:09,026 --> 01:06:10,796
- What's that? - On the way here,

1762
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:12,596
- Is it broken? - it broke.

1763
01:06:12,995 --> 01:06:14,605
Aren't you supposed to throw a dart?

1764
01:06:14,605 --> 01:06:16,335
It won't stop spinning.

1765
01:06:16,335 --> 01:06:21,576
(Which number will So Min get?)

1766
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:22,576
- It's a 6. - It's a 6.

1767
01:06:22,576 --> 01:06:23,576
- 60 dollars. - 60 dollars.

1768
01:06:23,576 --> 01:06:25,676
I hope I get a plus sign.

1769
01:06:25,676 --> 01:06:28,116
(As she got a big number, she has to get a plus sign.)

1770
01:06:28,116 --> 01:06:29,886
(If she gets a plus sign, she'll have more money than Kwang Soo.)

1771
01:06:29,886 --> 01:06:31,685
That's the sound it should make.

1772
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:33,455
(If she gets a plus sign, she'll have more money than Kwang Soo.)

1773
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:39,796
(Will So Min get plus 6 or minus 6?)

1774
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:41,725
- It's a plus sign. - Oh, my.

1775
01:06:41,725 --> 01:06:42,796
(Plus 6)

1776
01:06:42,796 --> 01:06:45,096
I'm getting 60 dollars.

1777
01:06:45,096 --> 01:06:48,105
Did you see? Please capture this. I'm getting 60 dollars.

1778
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,206
You're getting 60 dollars.

1779
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:50,336
I knew it.

1780
01:06:50,505 --> 01:06:52,406
- I'm so lucky. - So Min...

1781
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:54,776
has won 100 dollars in this car.

1782
01:06:54,975 --> 01:06:56,076
I won 100 dollars.

1783
01:06:56,076 --> 01:06:57,076
(So Min won 100 dollars in the car alone.)

1784
01:06:57,076 --> 01:06:58,446
It's Kwang Soo's turn now.

1785
01:06:58,776 --> 01:07:00,845
Let me hold it for you.

1786
01:07:01,845 --> 01:07:03,416
I'm already ahead of her.

1787
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:05,416
Kwang Soo is ahead of So Min.

1788
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:09,355
(The roulette can turn the situation around.)

1789
01:07:09,355 --> 01:07:13,496
(Will Kwang Soo be able to maintain the first place?)

1790
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:14,496
I'm getting dizzy.

1791
01:07:16,425 --> 01:07:17,536
(The result is out.)

1792
01:07:17,536 --> 01:07:18,536
It's an eight.

1793
01:07:19,295 --> 01:07:20,435
- It's a 1. - It's a 1?

1794
01:07:21,005 --> 01:07:22,265
It's 10 dollars.

1795
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:23,975
It's a one.

1796
01:07:23,975 --> 01:07:26,036
(Kwang Soo got the smallest number.)

1797
01:07:26,036 --> 01:07:28,105
Will it be a plus sign or a minus sign?

1798
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:31,416
It won't make a big difference. Take it easy.

1799
01:07:32,746 --> 01:07:33,746
Start.

1800
01:07:34,086 --> 01:07:35,116
Is this even worth anything?

1801
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:37,086
(Does it matter if he gets plus or minus?)

1802
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,956
- You never know. - I'm neither happy nor sad.

1803
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:41,925
I'll spin it.

1804
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,286
(It's still better to get a plus.)

1805
01:07:43,286 --> 01:07:49,265
(Would he win or lose 10 dollars?)

1806
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:53,706
(It's a minus.)

1807
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:54,836
It's a minus.

1808
01:07:55,866 --> 01:07:57,105
He got a minus.

1809
01:07:59,536 --> 01:08:00,576
I turned it around.

1810
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:01,845
I turned it around completely.

1811
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,175
- Kwang Soo is so bad. - He got minus 8.

1812
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:06,215
All the roulettes...

1813
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,685
What if you spin it again,

1814
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:11,185
and if you get a plus, you can take 20 dollars.

1815
01:08:11,185 --> 01:08:13,286
If you get a minus, you lose 20 dollars.

1816
01:08:14,126 --> 01:08:15,885
- Just plus or minus? Not this? - No.

1817
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:17,456
What if you spin the plus or minus,

1818
01:08:17,656 --> 01:08:20,326
and if you get a minus, you lose the 15 dollars you won.

1819
01:08:20,425 --> 01:08:22,465
- You'll lose everything. - You'll get zero dollars.

1820
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,295
- But if you win... - You'll get 20 dollars.

1821
01:08:24,295 --> 01:08:25,635
If you get a plus, you get 20 dollars.

1822
01:08:25,635 --> 01:08:26,635
Okay.

1823
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,605
(He can win 20 dollars if he gets a plus.)

1824
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:30,066
Good luck.

1825
01:08:30,975 --> 01:08:32,435
I hope you're happy.

1826
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:35,045
(He spins it as best as he can.)

1827
01:08:35,045 --> 01:08:36,276
Please.

1828
01:08:37,416 --> 01:08:40,616
(If it's a plus, he gets 20 dollars. If it's a minus, he gets 0.)

1829
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,746
- Okay. - What will it be?

1830
01:08:42,746 --> 01:08:44,986
This is the question.

1831
01:08:45,515 --> 01:08:47,786
- It's a minus. - I remember now.

1832
01:08:47,786 --> 01:08:49,286
- I don't remember. - He is...

1833
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:50,996
- really unlucky. - He is, right?

1834
01:08:50,996 --> 01:08:53,496
Please come forward, and take the truth or false cards.

1835
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:56,066
- You didn't know the question. - You remember, right?

1836
01:08:56,295 --> 01:08:57,435
Yes, I remember.

1837
01:08:57,435 --> 01:08:59,366
(Who will tell the truth, and who will lie?)

1838
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:00,736
Gosh.

1839
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,605
I can't trust them.

1840
01:09:03,066 --> 01:09:04,935
I'm going to look at their eyes.

1841
01:09:05,076 --> 01:09:08,105
I'll tell you exactly what happened.

1842
01:09:08,276 --> 01:09:10,316
Kwang Soo is usually unlucky,

1843
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:12,576
but sometimes, he gets lucky in the beginning.

1844
01:09:12,576 --> 01:09:15,416
- Right, right. - He got a plus and won the money.

1845
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:18,515
(So Min claims that Kwang Soo got a plus and won the money.)

1846
01:09:18,515 --> 01:09:19,685
That's right.

1847
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:21,086
- Let me tell you this. - Kwang Soo did.

1848
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:23,725
- So Min is convincing. - She's calm.

1849
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:27,725
I had much more money than her.

1850
01:09:27,725 --> 01:09:29,395
I started with 100 dollars, and she had 50.

1851
01:09:29,395 --> 01:09:30,536
In the end...

1852
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:31,765
I can say the result, right?

1853
01:09:32,066 --> 01:09:33,135
It doesn't matter.

1854
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,305
In the end, I lost.

1855
01:09:34,305 --> 01:09:35,706
(In the end, I lost.)

1856
01:09:36,066 --> 01:09:37,236
She overtook me.

1857
01:09:37,236 --> 01:09:40,076
(Kwang Soo claims he got a minus, and So Min overtook him.)

1858
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:41,545
That wasn't the only game.

1859
01:09:41,545 --> 01:09:42,946
- There were games after this. - There were, right?

1860
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,246
-That's right, So Min. - There weren't games like this.

1861
01:09:45,246 --> 01:09:48,586
I don't have much to say about this.

1862
01:09:48,586 --> 01:09:50,786
It's either a plus or minus.

1863
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,685
Excuse me, but are you listening to the radio?

1864
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:57,696
(Excuse me, but are you listening to the radio?)

1865
01:09:57,925 --> 01:09:59,496
What are you doing?

1866
01:09:59,496 --> 01:10:01,225
Can you lower the volume?

1867
01:10:01,225 --> 01:10:02,666
What are you doing?

1868
01:10:02,666 --> 01:10:04,935
- I don't really know him. - I thought this was free time.

1869
01:10:04,935 --> 01:10:06,536
I'm still debating.

1870
01:10:06,536 --> 01:10:08,536
- You're listening. - Right.

1871
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:11,475
I lost most of my money here.

1872
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:12,475
You punk.

1873
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:14,505
(You punk)

1874
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:16,005
Stop lying. Tell the truth.

1875
01:10:16,005 --> 01:10:19,045
(What punk?)

1876
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:20,246
(Stop lying. Tell the truth.)

1877
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:21,916
I was watching you.

1878
01:10:22,116 --> 01:10:23,486
Who are you, mister?

1879
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,616
Who are you?

1880
01:10:25,616 --> 01:10:28,385
Punk, I was watching you. Stop lying.

1881
01:10:28,385 --> 01:10:30,026
- You punk. - You punk.

1882
01:10:30,095 --> 01:10:31,755
Kwang Soo.

1883
01:10:31,755 --> 01:10:32,925
You're telling the truth.

1884
01:10:32,925 --> 01:10:35,965
(Kwang Soo, you're telling the truth.)

1885
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:37,635
Thank you. I'm serious.

1886
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:39,135
Again?

1887
01:10:39,135 --> 01:10:41,066
(Nobody believes him, but Jong Kook does.)

1888
01:10:41,066 --> 01:10:43,305
You're indeed Justice Kook.

1889
01:10:43,305 --> 01:10:46,746
If you're lying, you're in trouble.

1890
01:10:46,746 --> 01:10:48,045
- Please give us some advice. - What's this about?

1891
01:10:48,305 --> 01:10:51,576
So Min suggested this game.

1892
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:54,316
He lost, so he asked So Min to play another round.

1893
01:10:54,446 --> 01:10:56,185
That's why there were other games after this.

1894
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,515
- No. - Mister.

1895
01:10:57,515 --> 01:10:59,715
I've been watching you.

1896
01:10:59,956 --> 01:11:01,755
- If you think... - Excuse me.

1897
01:11:01,755 --> 01:11:03,055
Keep watching me then.

1898
01:11:03,725 --> 01:11:05,795
- Don't say anything. Just watch. - All right.

1899
01:11:05,925 --> 01:11:07,026
Sure.

1900
01:11:07,026 --> 01:11:09,566
- You're right. - You were watching me.

1901
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:12,265
- Why would you speak now? - That's true.

1902
01:11:12,336 --> 01:11:13,635
I'm telling you everything.

1903
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:16,105
- Whatever situation... - Kwang Soo.

1904
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,135
I'm being honest.

1905
01:11:17,135 --> 01:11:18,605
- He doesn't look confident. - He's sweating.

1906
01:11:18,605 --> 01:11:19,836
No, it's oil.

1907
01:11:20,475 --> 01:11:22,876
Listen to me. I'm serious.

1908
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,045
I started going downhill...

1909
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:25,316
Stop it, you punk.

1910
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:27,045
You punk.

1911
01:11:27,045 --> 01:11:31,555
(Kwang Soo explodes.)

1912
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:32,755
I let you go a few times.

1913
01:11:33,385 --> 01:11:34,925
- Fine. - Do you want to be handcuffed?

1914
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:36,425
I think you are right.

1915
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:37,996
- I am. - Give me a vote.

1916
01:11:37,996 --> 01:11:40,196
Please give me a vote. I'm certain.

1917
01:11:40,326 --> 01:11:41,496
All right.

1918
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:43,965
We won't be using these cards for this round.

1919
01:11:44,395 --> 01:11:46,265
We'll decide using the Car of Truth.

1920
01:11:46,265 --> 01:11:49,366
(They'll decide using the Car of Truth.)

1921
01:11:49,366 --> 01:11:50,605
- Car of Truth? - In the parking lot,

1922
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:53,946
there are two buses with Kwang Soo and So Min's names on them.

1923
01:11:54,045 --> 01:11:57,345
Please get on the bus of the person you think is telling the truth.

1924
01:11:57,576 --> 01:11:58,645
However,

1925
01:11:58,746 --> 01:12:03,316
the penalty for this round is a very scary ride.

1926
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:08,185
(If you make the wrong choice, you get a scary penalty.)

1927
01:12:08,755 --> 01:12:12,126
(The staff members already tried it out.)

1928
01:12:12,126 --> 01:12:14,725
(They couldn't recover from it.)

1929
01:12:14,725 --> 01:12:16,066
Let's end this here.

1930
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:17,795
Oh, my goodness. I don't like rides.

1931
01:12:17,795 --> 01:12:19,366
This is so difficult.

1932
01:12:19,366 --> 01:12:20,706
Please make up your minds.

1933
01:12:21,336 --> 01:12:25,076
Let's move to the Car of Truth.

1934
01:12:25,076 --> 01:12:26,135
(If you want to avoid the penalty, you must get on the Car of Truth.)

1935
01:12:27,045 --> 01:12:29,246
(It's time to choose.)

1936
01:12:29,246 --> 01:12:30,675
Come here, everybody.

1937
01:12:32,045 --> 01:12:33,316
Please come.

1938
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:35,185
- Jeon So Min. - I'm serious.

1939
01:12:35,185 --> 01:12:37,885
- Jeon So Min. - I think you know.

1940
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:39,916
- I'm truthful. - Truth gets told,

1941
01:12:39,916 --> 01:12:41,555
and justice wins.

1942
01:12:42,026 --> 01:12:43,925
I think So Min is lying.

1943
01:12:43,925 --> 01:12:46,055
That's what I thought from the beginning.

1944
01:12:46,055 --> 01:12:47,295
I lost in the end.

1945
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,236
I was ahead of her by 50 dollars, but I lost.

1946
01:12:50,236 --> 01:12:52,196
Remember the first time.

1947
01:12:52,336 --> 01:12:55,066
Kwang Soo is really good at lying now.

1948
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:56,135
I'm serious.

1949
01:12:56,406 --> 01:12:58,305
- You punk. - There he goes again.

1950
01:12:58,406 --> 01:12:59,975
What?

1951
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,576
If you're lying, I won't leave you alone.

1952
01:13:02,576 --> 01:13:04,345
Is he a mental patient?

1953
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:05,845
- What is wrong with you? - I won't leave you alone.

1954
01:13:05,845 --> 01:13:07,486
Jae Seok, trust me this time. I'm telling the truth.

1955
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:09,786
I think it's So Min.

1956
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:10,786
(Ji Hyo uses her instincts.)

1957
01:13:11,255 --> 01:13:12,515
- Okay. - Really.

1958
01:13:12,515 --> 01:13:14,055
I'm serious, Haha.

1959
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:15,586
Okay.

1960
01:13:15,586 --> 01:13:18,725
You have to go on the ride.

1961
01:13:19,026 --> 01:13:20,055
I'm serious.

1962
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,326
Se Chan.

1963
01:13:21,326 --> 01:13:22,765
Please trust me this time.

1964
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:24,135
Haha, let's go.

1965
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:25,836
Haha.

1966
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:29,135
- Go away, you liar. - It's over.

1967
01:13:29,135 --> 01:13:30,276
Once you get on, it's over.

1968
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:31,975
It'll most likely be you.

1969
01:13:32,706 --> 01:13:34,805
- Hold on. - He usually doesn't talk a lot.

1970
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:36,605
He doesn't talk a lot.

1971
01:13:36,605 --> 01:13:38,475
When he's lying...

1972
01:13:38,475 --> 01:13:39,746
I know we're going on the Nevis Swing together,

1973
01:13:39,746 --> 01:13:42,885
but don't try to control me.

1974
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:44,316
Follow me, Haha.

1975
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:47,055
You're a coward.

1976
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,156
- Hold on. - Follow me.

1977
01:13:48,156 --> 01:13:50,425
- You're going to get on, right? - Where are you going to go?

1978
01:13:50,496 --> 01:13:52,725
- I don't know yet. - Don't regret it. He's wrong.

1979
01:13:53,526 --> 01:13:54,696
I'm honest.

1980
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:56,465
Let's see how this looks.

1981
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:57,836
(He peeks into So Min's bus.)

1982
01:13:58,095 --> 01:13:59,295
I'm here,

1983
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:01,135
- your younger brother. - All right.

1984
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:02,336
- Se Chan. - Yes, brother.

1985
01:14:02,336 --> 01:14:05,305
Think about how terrible you felt when you lost to Kwang Soo.

1986
01:14:05,305 --> 01:14:06,746
- Right. - Think about it.

1987
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:08,845
Even if we get lied to,

1988
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:11,215
- it's better to let So Min fool us. - I agree.

1989
01:14:14,715 --> 01:14:15,845
I'll get on this bus.

1990
01:14:18,215 --> 01:14:20,225
Do I have no credibility?

1991
01:14:20,225 --> 01:14:21,826
No, this is better.

1992
01:14:21,826 --> 01:14:23,355
This is so unfair.

1993
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:25,055
Am I not credible?

1994
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:26,626
I can't believe Haha went there.

1995
01:14:26,626 --> 01:14:27,826
Are you still debating, Ji Hyo?

1996
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,496
No, I think it's Kwang Soo.

1997
01:14:30,496 --> 01:14:33,805
If Ji Hyo gets this right,

1998
01:14:34,066 --> 01:14:37,036
I feel sorry for your previous boyfriends.

1999
01:14:37,036 --> 01:14:38,836
(You can never lie to her.)

2000
01:14:38,836 --> 01:14:40,276
They can't lie to you at all.

2001
01:14:41,105 --> 01:14:44,175
- She knows everything. - She's good at this.

2002
01:14:44,576 --> 01:14:46,045
- Somebody's coming. - Seok Jin.

2003
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,786
(She touts them with prizes.)

2004
01:14:47,786 --> 01:14:49,215
- Okay. - Look at this.

2005
01:14:50,116 --> 01:14:51,986
- Seok Jin. - I have low energy.

2006
01:14:51,986 --> 01:14:54,355
Enjoy the ride.

2007
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:56,656
- Enjoy the ride. - I'll drink it up.

2008
01:14:56,656 --> 01:14:58,095
- Ji Hyo. - Watch her.

2009
01:14:58,855 --> 01:15:00,166
I wish you luck.

2010
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:02,925
I wish you luck.

2011
01:15:03,395 --> 01:15:05,795
I'm so tired these days because I'm babysitting.

2012
01:15:05,866 --> 01:15:07,206
- Have one. - It's ginseng.

2013
01:15:07,206 --> 01:15:09,105
(They love the free gifts.)

2014
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:11,206
(Gulping)

2015
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:13,645
- This is sweet. - It's good.

2016
01:15:13,645 --> 01:15:15,376
- It's the pure extract. - It's good.

2017
01:15:16,175 --> 01:15:18,276
I like this.

2018
01:15:19,746 --> 01:15:21,586
Thank you. Oh, really?

2019
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:24,916
- The bus can't leave. Come. - Me?

2020
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,885
It's time to go. Why aren't you coming?

2021
01:15:26,885 --> 01:15:28,055
What do you mean?

2022
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,696
- That wasn't the plan. - He told me something.

2023
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:32,425
I'm certain.

2024
01:15:32,425 --> 01:15:34,225
- Why are you trying to take me? - Don't go.

2025
01:15:34,225 --> 01:15:36,196
- Seok Jin, why do you think so? - We took a vote,

2026
01:15:36,196 --> 01:15:39,166
and you're the most gullible one from here.

2027
01:15:39,166 --> 01:15:40,366
(He's so gullible.)

2028
01:15:40,366 --> 01:15:41,566
- Seok Jin. - Why do you think so?

2029
01:15:41,566 --> 01:15:43,336
Seok Jin, that bus is cooler.

2030
01:15:43,336 --> 01:15:44,706
(It's at least cooler.)

2031
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:47,746
(He gets up without a second thought.)

2032
01:15:47,746 --> 01:15:49,805
Let go.

2033
01:15:49,805 --> 01:15:51,545
- It's so hot here. - Focus.

2034
01:15:51,545 --> 01:15:54,446
- It's so hot here. - Focus. Focus!

2035
01:15:54,515 --> 01:15:56,715
- Seok Jin. - He doesn't care.

2036
01:15:56,715 --> 01:15:58,215
You'll be punished for sure.

2037
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:00,086
You'll be punished.

2038
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:01,555
Okay.

2039
01:16:01,986 --> 01:16:04,526
(I don't like the heat.)

2040
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,026
- Who is it? - It's Seok Jin.

2041
01:16:06,026 --> 01:16:08,265
- Seok Jin. - All right.

2042
01:16:08,265 --> 01:16:10,866
- Isn't it cooler here? - It's So Min.

2043
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,166
- Okay. - It's a lot cooler here, right?

2044
01:16:13,196 --> 01:16:15,366
- Good job. - Why aren't they coming here?

2045
01:16:15,366 --> 01:16:17,276
- Good job. - Let's go.

2046
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:19,805
(How will Kwang Soo and So Min defend themselves?)

2047
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:21,946
As long as more people don't come here...

2048
01:16:21,946 --> 01:16:23,876
Aren't you certain though?

2049
01:16:24,215 --> 01:16:25,876
- I'm not. - I'm not.

2050
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:29,645
- Look at this situation. - This is the strange thing, Ji Hyo.

2051
01:16:29,715 --> 01:16:34,055
Let's do the opposite of Jae Seok.

2052
01:16:34,225 --> 01:16:36,185
- For sure. - Let's do that.

2053
01:16:36,185 --> 01:16:39,126
You have to ride the Navy Swing anyway. Do you want this too?

2054
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:42,395
(You have to ride the Navy Swing anyway.)

2055
01:16:42,395 --> 01:16:43,566
Isn't it the Nevis Swing?

2056
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,696
Is it? Nevis Swing.

2057
01:16:45,696 --> 01:16:48,066
(It's the same thing.)

2058
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:50,736
I'm telling the truth.

2059
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:52,336
(If Kwang Soo's claim is a lie, they both get punished.)

2060
01:16:52,336 --> 01:16:53,776
This is the truth.

2061
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:55,805
I think So Min...

2062
01:16:55,805 --> 01:16:58,446
She didn't act like it was unfair.

2063
01:16:58,446 --> 01:17:00,746
She looked like she was pulling our legs.

2064
01:17:00,746 --> 01:17:03,015
- I think... - That's why.

2065
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:07,555
I see her motive in wanting to take the members.

2066
01:17:09,055 --> 01:17:14,465
(Is So Min's plea a lie?)

2067
01:17:14,465 --> 01:17:16,496
We have a lie detector ready if you need it.

2068
01:17:16,496 --> 01:17:18,435
The one you put your hand on?

2069
01:17:18,465 --> 01:17:20,066
I can do it.

2070
01:17:20,305 --> 01:17:21,536
- Should we try it? - I can do it.

2071
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:23,005
(They bring in a special equipment.)

2072
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:24,135
Put your hand on this.

2073
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:25,776
(It's a lie detector.)

2074
01:17:25,776 --> 01:17:27,345
- All right. - Your hands are sweaty.

2075
01:17:27,345 --> 01:17:28,576
- So Min. - Yes.

2076
01:17:28,776 --> 01:17:32,446
- Is this a lie or not? - It's not.

2077
01:17:33,045 --> 01:17:34,116
It's the truth.

2078
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:35,515
- Are you certain? - I am.

2079
01:17:35,515 --> 01:17:36,816
(She says she's not lying.)

2080
01:17:37,816 --> 01:17:40,055
(What will their special equipment make out?)

2081
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,225
I am.

2082
01:17:41,786 --> 01:17:42,885
(Zapping)

2083
01:17:42,885 --> 01:17:47,566
That stings.

2084
01:17:48,366 --> 01:17:49,725
No.

2085
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:51,965
Can we change our minds?

2086
01:17:52,295 --> 01:17:53,566
- Gosh. - Hold on.

2087
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:55,706
This made me lose trust in you.

2088
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,376
I'm telling the truth.

2089
01:17:57,376 --> 01:17:59,076
Wait. This is saying she's lying.

2090
01:17:59,076 --> 01:18:00,906
They're both actors,

2091
01:18:00,906 --> 01:18:03,045
so they're great at acting. They'll always trick us.

2092
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:06,986
I can't act without a script.

2093
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,685
- What do you mean? - I can't do it on the spot.

2094
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,685
- Put your hand on this. - Ad-libbing?

2095
01:18:11,685 --> 01:18:12,956
Try it again.

2096
01:18:13,885 --> 01:18:15,986
I can't act without a script.

2097
01:18:15,986 --> 01:18:17,755
This is not acting. This is for real.

2098
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:18,855
- Are you sure? - This is the truth.

2099
01:18:18,855 --> 01:18:20,795
Should we trust her?

2100
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:22,496
I'm getting anxious.

2101
01:18:23,395 --> 01:18:25,236
I'm telling the truth.

2102
01:18:25,236 --> 01:18:26,866
- Are you certain? - I am.

2103
01:18:26,866 --> 01:18:32,005
(Will it be true this time?)

2104
01:18:33,776 --> 01:18:36,376
(It's the truth.)

2105
01:18:36,376 --> 01:18:38,515
It's fine. Please take this away.

2106
01:18:38,515 --> 01:18:40,086
We'll trust So Min.

2107
01:18:40,086 --> 01:18:42,185
Hold on. Why was she...

2108
01:18:42,316 --> 01:18:44,956
- so surprised? - I know, right?

2109
01:18:45,956 --> 01:18:48,685
(Was she surprised...)

2110
01:18:48,685 --> 01:18:50,956
(that it was deemed to be true?)

2111
01:18:50,956 --> 01:18:52,795
Why was she shocked by the result?

2112
01:18:52,996 --> 01:18:54,795
No, I thought it was going to be a lie.

2113
01:18:54,795 --> 01:18:57,265
- You never know. - If she was telling the truth,

2114
01:18:57,265 --> 01:19:00,536
she would have been like, "Right?"

2115
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:03,105
But she was surprised. That's strange.

2116
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,236
Listen to the way she said it.

2117
01:19:05,336 --> 01:19:08,906
If she was lying,

2118
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:11,145
she would have breathed in while saying that.

2119
01:19:11,145 --> 01:19:14,246
But she breathed out.

2120
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,486
There's such thing.

2121
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:18,885
I think she's telling the truth.

2122
01:19:19,616 --> 01:19:20,826
Wait.

2123
01:19:20,826 --> 01:19:22,526
- He's just... - There's such thing?

2124
01:19:22,526 --> 01:19:23,925
- guessing today. - There is.

2125
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,696
If somebody else said that, you would have disagreed.

2126
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:27,395
- Her exclamation... - Am I not right?

2127
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:29,265
She was surprised that this was right.

2128
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,965
- That's what she meant. - Are you sure?

2129
01:19:31,965 --> 01:19:33,236
Of course, I am.

2130
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:35,736
We're not doubting her anymore after what Jong Kook said.

2131
01:19:36,706 --> 01:19:38,435
He's so convincing.

2132
01:19:38,435 --> 01:19:40,645
- Do you want to try it? - No, I'm scared of it.

2133
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:41,675
- Why? - It scares me.

2134
01:19:41,675 --> 01:19:42,805
Try it.

2135
01:19:42,805 --> 01:19:44,145
- Try it. - Put your hand on it.

2136
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:45,215
(Seok Jin becomes a subject to verify the special equipment.)

2137
01:19:45,215 --> 01:19:47,015
- Why are you ramping it up? - I'm not.

2138
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,715
(Seok Jin becomes a subject to verify the special equipment.)

2139
01:19:48,715 --> 01:19:50,656
Ask me a question. I'm getting sweaty.

2140
01:19:50,656 --> 01:19:51,855
Wait. Do you have...

2141
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:54,156
a question for him?

2142
01:19:54,385 --> 01:19:57,326
That burns.

2143
01:19:58,326 --> 01:19:59,555
He's full of lies.

2144
01:19:59,755 --> 01:20:01,425
He's full of lies.

2145
01:20:01,425 --> 01:20:03,895
- That burns. - I didn't even ask a question.

2146
01:20:03,895 --> 01:20:06,366
He's a liar.

2147
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:08,736
He's a liar himself.

2148
01:20:08,736 --> 01:20:10,906
The lie detector is confusing us.

2149
01:20:11,036 --> 01:20:13,036
This is confusing us more.

2150
01:20:13,036 --> 01:20:15,076
Can we try this on Kwang Soo?

2151
01:20:15,345 --> 01:20:17,045
They're probably doing it.

2152
01:20:17,045 --> 01:20:18,576
They probably are.

2153
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:22,816
I'll answer truthfully to your questions.

2154
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:24,486
"I'm lying right now."

2155
01:20:24,555 --> 01:20:25,555
No.

2156
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:29,055
(He says no.)

2157
01:20:29,055 --> 01:20:30,095
I'm confident.

2158
01:20:30,095 --> 01:20:33,026
(What does the lie detector think?)

2159
01:20:33,026 --> 01:20:35,765
I got a minus. Look.

2160
01:20:35,765 --> 01:20:37,696
(It thinks he's telling the truth.)

2161
01:20:37,696 --> 01:20:39,765
"I'm lying right now."

2162
01:20:40,066 --> 01:20:41,135
I'm confident.

2163
01:20:41,605 --> 01:20:42,666
No.

2164
01:20:42,935 --> 01:20:44,305
I'm telling the truth.

2165
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:45,876
(He gets asked the same question.)

2166
01:20:46,105 --> 01:20:47,305
(Zapping)

2167
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:51,246
(It's a lie.)

2168
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:54,545
(Were you lying, Kwang Soo?)

2169
01:20:54,545 --> 01:20:56,885
You punk, you can lie to us one time...

2170
01:20:57,215 --> 01:20:59,816
- but not twice. - You can't lie to us twice.

2171
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:05,055
The culprit always returns to the scene of the crime.

2172
01:21:05,055 --> 01:21:06,126
I'm telling the truth.

2173
01:21:06,696 --> 01:21:08,526
Please give me another chance.

2174
01:21:09,765 --> 01:21:13,336
"When I went to Indonesia,"

2175
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:16,605
"I went into So Min's room."

2176
01:21:17,276 --> 01:21:19,175
I didn't.

2177
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:25,515
(He says no.)

2178
01:21:25,515 --> 01:21:27,185
I don't know why I should be doing this.

2179
01:21:27,185 --> 01:21:29,715
"I went into So Min's room." Yes or no.

2180
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,916
- No. - No? Are you sure?

2181
01:21:31,916 --> 01:21:34,385
Why should I be doing this?

2182
01:21:34,385 --> 01:21:35,826
(He says no again.)

2183
01:21:35,826 --> 01:21:37,656
This is how truthful...

2184
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:39,425
(It's true again.)

2185
01:21:39,425 --> 01:21:40,566
Then,

2186
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:45,366
"So Min came into my room." Yes or no.

2187
01:21:45,836 --> 01:21:46,935
No.

2188
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:52,076
(He says she didn't come into his room.)

2189
01:21:52,076 --> 01:21:54,906
(Zapping)

2190
01:21:55,105 --> 01:21:57,416
(It's a downright lie.)

2191
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:58,746
I was thinking.

2192
01:21:59,076 --> 01:22:00,715
She came when we were filming.

2193
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:03,416
- She came. I'm right. - My gosh.

2194
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:05,416
I know this sounds weird,

2195
01:22:05,656 --> 01:22:07,055
but she came to film.

2196
01:22:07,055 --> 01:22:09,555
I'm being honest. This is a malfunction.

2197
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,526
Please give it back.

2198
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:13,126
You can't just take it back.

2199
01:22:13,326 --> 01:22:15,295
What does that make me?

2200
01:22:15,295 --> 01:22:17,895
(It leaves many questions behind.)

2201
01:22:17,895 --> 01:22:19,135
Can you give me that?

2202
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,765
- Let's see how you usually are. - Is this what they used?

2203
01:22:21,765 --> 01:22:23,066
Spin it three times.

2204
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:24,536
I don't know.

2205
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:27,005
Spin it like how you did before.

2206
01:22:27,005 --> 01:22:28,076
This is how it felt like.

2207
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,145
(It's the same roulette Kwang Soo said he got a minus on.)

2208
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:33,645
See? You get lucky sometimes too.

2209
01:22:33,645 --> 01:22:34,816
Try it again.

2210
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,816
If you get a plus, you are done.

2211
01:22:38,515 --> 01:22:40,755
See? It works.

2212
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:43,326
- He can get a plus. - What's going on?

2213
01:22:45,225 --> 01:22:49,095
(The third spin)

2214
01:22:49,095 --> 01:22:51,696
See? He got a plus all three times.

2215
01:22:51,696 --> 01:22:55,265
This is so interesting.

2216
01:22:55,265 --> 01:22:58,276
A lie detector? A roulette?

2217
01:22:58,276 --> 01:22:59,805
- That's how it seems. - He doesn't have to...

2218
01:22:59,805 --> 01:23:01,605
get minuses all the time.

2219
01:23:01,605 --> 01:23:03,576
He got pluses all three times.

2220
01:23:03,576 --> 01:23:04,816
It always goes the opposite.

2221
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:07,215
That's the strange thing. It gives me goosebumps,

2222
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,645
but I got a minus last time.

2223
01:23:09,345 --> 01:23:11,755
Please prove yourself. Spin it for the last time.

2224
01:23:12,015 --> 01:23:13,626
Today's a weird day for me.

2225
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:19,095
(If you're telling the truth, prove yourself.)

2226
01:23:20,526 --> 01:23:24,166
(The last spin...)

2227
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,295
(is a plus again.)

2228
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:27,435
See?

2229
01:23:28,566 --> 01:23:31,675
- Who am I supposed to trust? - Fine.

2230
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:32,836
This might seem weird.

2231
01:23:32,836 --> 01:23:34,706
It was weird that I got four pluses in a row.

2232
01:23:35,576 --> 01:23:36,916
However, that day...

2233
01:23:36,916 --> 01:23:38,416
(Why is Kwang Soo getting lucky all of a sudden?)

2234
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:39,715
What am I supposed to do?

2235
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:41,345
I did get a minus. How am I supposed to prove it?

2236
01:23:41,345 --> 01:23:43,916
This is what happened today, and it was different last time.

2237
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,326
(What is he saying?)

2238
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:48,855
Okay. It's strange.

2239
01:23:48,855 --> 01:23:50,996
- What is he saying? - I know it's strange.

2240
01:23:50,996 --> 01:23:53,095
"What am I supposed to do?"

2241
01:23:53,095 --> 01:23:54,465
(Is it Kwang Soo or So Min who's telling the truth?)

2242
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:55,496
I'm being honest.

2243
01:23:56,725 --> 01:23:58,236
(This is where the truth will be revealed.)

2244
01:23:58,236 --> 01:24:00,265
Why are we going bungee jumping?

2245
01:24:00,265 --> 01:24:02,236
- No way. - I won't do it.

2246
01:24:02,236 --> 01:24:04,206
- We won't do it. - We can't.

2247
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,336
We can't bungee jump.

2248
01:24:06,336 --> 01:24:08,805
- We can't. - It's the one that springs up.

2249
01:24:08,805 --> 01:24:10,776
- Is it zip lining? - Seok Jin and I did it before.

2250
01:24:13,246 --> 01:24:15,616
- This is it. - That's right.

2251
01:24:15,746 --> 01:24:18,286
I don't like bungee jumping, but I don't like this either.

2252
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:19,916
This is driving me nuts.

2253
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,156
I'm sorry.

2254
01:24:22,156 --> 01:24:24,295
I'm sorry that I keep saying this,

2255
01:24:24,496 --> 01:24:29,595
but this made me wet myself a little bit.

2256
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,536
What am I supposed to do about the Nevis Swing?

2257
01:24:32,536 --> 01:24:34,206
- Stop it, Haha. - Gosh.

2258
01:24:34,265 --> 01:24:35,536
Stop it.

2259
01:24:35,536 --> 01:24:37,805
Stop talking about the Nevis Swing.

2260
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:40,706
I'd rather become their honorary ambassador.

2261
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:42,805
It's a slingshot.

2262
01:24:42,805 --> 01:24:44,576
- Have you decided? - Yes.

2263
01:24:44,816 --> 01:24:45,876
I'm telling the truth.

2264
01:24:45,876 --> 01:24:47,416
I believe...

2265
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,246
- the pieces of the puzzle... - Were you telling me the truth?

2266
01:24:49,246 --> 01:24:51,616
came together on the bus.

2267
01:24:51,755 --> 01:24:53,885
I don't know about these two.

2268
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:55,326
Please make your final decisions.

2269
01:24:55,355 --> 01:24:58,026
If you think it was a minus, please pick Kwang Soo.

2270
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,566
If you think it was a plus, please pick So Min.

2271
01:25:00,566 --> 01:25:01,866
Please decide.

2272
01:25:01,866 --> 01:25:03,595
(If it was a plus, you need to pick So Min.)

2273
01:25:03,965 --> 01:25:05,196
One,

2274
01:25:05,965 --> 01:25:07,105
two...

2275
01:25:07,105 --> 01:25:08,906
(The person with more votes gets the penalty exemption.)

2276
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:12,906
(What will the 6 members say?)

2277
01:25:12,906 --> 01:25:14,345
- Three. - I have no idea.

2278
01:25:15,576 --> 01:25:19,446
(It's 3 on 3.)

2279
01:25:19,616 --> 01:25:23,215
- It's 3 on 3. - It's a tie.

2280
01:25:23,215 --> 01:25:25,286
- Seok Jin... - That means Kwang Soo...

2281
01:25:25,586 --> 01:25:26,715
has to go on.

2282
01:25:26,715 --> 01:25:28,156
Really? Why?

2283
01:25:28,156 --> 01:25:29,526
If there's a tie,

2284
01:25:29,526 --> 01:25:31,095
Kwang Soo has to go on.

2285
01:25:31,095 --> 01:25:32,826
He lost in the Tiger Moth Tour Truth Game.

2286
01:25:32,826 --> 01:25:35,295
Let me reveal the answer.

2287
01:25:35,295 --> 01:25:37,095
I don't know about this.

2288
01:25:38,465 --> 01:25:39,996
I hope you're happy.

2289
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:44,605
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, and Se Chan picked plus.)

2290
01:25:44,605 --> 01:25:46,605
Please. Let it be a minus.

2291
01:25:46,706 --> 01:25:47,746
Please.

2292
01:25:50,475 --> 01:25:51,515
Please.

2293
01:25:52,876 --> 01:25:55,345
(Was it a plus or minus?)

2294
01:25:55,345 --> 01:25:58,286
(It's a minus.)

2295
01:25:58,286 --> 01:25:59,656
It doesn't work for you.

2296
01:25:59,656 --> 01:26:01,486
- It's a minus. - It is.

2297
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:03,755
- It's a minus. - It's a minus.

2298
01:26:03,755 --> 01:26:05,925
(Seok Jin, Haha, and Ji Hyo get the penalty exemption.)

2299
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:06,996
You were telling the truth.

2300
01:26:08,095 --> 01:26:09,965
Didn't we win? We guessed it right.

2301
01:26:09,965 --> 01:26:11,666
See?

2302
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,336
- So Min. - Where did she go?

2303
01:26:14,105 --> 01:26:16,135
- So Min. - My gosh.

2304
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:19,836
So Min, this won't do.

2305
01:26:20,946 --> 01:26:23,045
I won't trust her anymore.

2306
01:26:23,675 --> 01:26:25,316
Remember what I said?

2307
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:28,586
(It's so unfair for him.)

2308
01:26:29,816 --> 01:26:31,416
Please come forward.

2309
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:34,456
You must convince the members according to what your card says.

2310
01:26:34,456 --> 01:26:37,055
Your goal is to get as many on your side as possible.

2311
01:26:37,055 --> 01:26:38,626
(He was supposed to tell the truth,)

2312
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:43,435
(and he spun it the same way he did in Indonesia.)

2313
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:47,406
See? It works.

2314
01:26:48,465 --> 01:26:51,076
See? He got a plus all three times.

2315
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:53,946
See?

2316
01:26:54,805 --> 01:26:57,916
(He got pluses four times in a row.)

2317
01:26:58,616 --> 01:26:59,616
This might seem weird.

2318
01:26:59,616 --> 01:27:02,345
What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to prove it?

2319
01:27:02,345 --> 01:27:04,916
This is what happened today, and it was different last time.

2320
01:27:04,916 --> 01:27:06,855
(You should've been honest beforehand.)

2321
01:27:08,685 --> 01:27:10,696
There are four members who got selected.

2322
01:27:10,696 --> 01:27:11,956
So Min, come on.

2323
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:15,095
Only 2 out of 4 will go on the ride.

2324
01:27:15,095 --> 01:27:16,166
- Okay. - Okay.

2325
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:18,265
We prepared some rice cakes.

2326
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:20,605
2 are filled with honey, and 2 are wasabi.

2327
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:21,736
I can't do this.

2328
01:27:21,736 --> 01:27:22,866
Gosh.

2329
01:27:22,866 --> 01:27:27,505
(2 are honey-filled rice cakes, and 2 are wasabi.)

2330
01:27:28,845 --> 01:27:32,345
I think this is honey, Jae Seok.

2331
01:27:32,975 --> 01:27:35,416
- Be quiet. - Go away.

2332
01:27:35,986 --> 01:27:38,555
(It's all thanks to you that we are doing this.)

2333
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:40,626
The unlucky members can choose first.

2334
01:27:40,725 --> 01:27:41,956
- Kwang Soo, choose. - He is right.

2335
01:27:42,026 --> 01:27:44,725
It will be funny if the ones Jong Kook and Se Chan didn't pick...

2336
01:27:44,725 --> 01:27:46,626
- contain wasabi. - That's right.

2337
01:27:46,626 --> 01:27:48,526
- Hurry up. - That's why we will pick first.

2338
01:27:48,526 --> 01:27:49,895
- We will try our luck. - Okay.

2339
01:27:49,895 --> 01:27:51,336
- Okay. - Okay.

2340
01:27:52,336 --> 01:27:53,866
- I pick this one. - Okay.

2341
01:27:54,265 --> 01:27:56,435
We really are unlucky.

2342
01:27:56,435 --> 01:27:58,175
(Kwang Soo picks the rice cake Jae Seok wanted to pick.)

2343
01:27:58,175 --> 01:28:00,145
- He chose the heavy one. - I had a good feeling about it.

2344
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:01,345
I felt an affinity...

2345
01:28:01,345 --> 01:28:02,805
- the moment I laid my eyes on it. - I bet you like that one.

2346
01:28:02,805 --> 01:28:04,446
- I knew it. - I like this one.

2347
01:28:04,645 --> 01:28:06,545
- I like this one. - I did, too.

2348
01:28:06,616 --> 01:28:09,116
- I will pick this one. - Okay. That's good.

2349
01:28:09,116 --> 01:28:10,515
(They finish choosing the rice cake.)

2350
01:28:10,515 --> 01:28:11,515
What's inside?

2351
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,215
How did the unlucky members do?

2352
01:28:13,725 --> 01:28:15,456
- Shall we go? - I hope mine contains honey.

2353
01:28:15,456 --> 01:28:16,456
(It's time to choose who will go on the slingshot.)

2354
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:23,295
(The one with wasabi rice cake are the lucky winners.)

2355
01:28:25,166 --> 01:28:30,336
(Which 2 members were chosen by wasabi rice cake?)

2356
01:28:31,336 --> 01:28:33,545
- In 2, 3. - Wasabi will hit them hard.

2357
01:28:33,545 --> 01:28:34,706
(They put rice cake in their mouths at the same time.)

2358
01:28:34,975 --> 01:28:36,475
Wasabi will hit them hard.

2359
01:28:36,706 --> 01:28:38,145
It hit Jae Seok.

2360
01:28:38,715 --> 01:28:40,746
- Jae Seok is enduring it. - That's right.

2361
01:28:40,746 --> 01:28:42,015
It hit Jae Seok.

2362
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,385
(My goodness.)

2363
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:45,656
Does mine contain honey?

2364
01:28:45,656 --> 01:28:46,786
It hit Se Chan.

2365
01:28:46,786 --> 01:28:48,555
- It hit Se Chan. - It hit Se Chan.

2366
01:28:48,555 --> 01:28:49,725
(Jae Seok and Se Chan eat wasabi rice cake.)

2367
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:50,895
It's Jae Seok and Se Chan.

2368
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,425
Are they okay?

2369
01:28:54,725 --> 01:28:55,725
Is it sweet? How does it taste?

2370
01:28:56,626 --> 01:28:58,536
- It's Se Chan. - It's Se Chan.

2371
01:28:58,536 --> 01:28:59,935
(Jae Seok and Se Chan are chosen to go on the slingshot.)

2372
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,236
Se Chan is struggling.

2373
01:29:01,236 --> 01:29:02,935
(Jae Seok pretends like it isn't him.)

2374
01:29:03,406 --> 01:29:05,135
Jae Seok, you will die if you eat it.

2375
01:29:05,135 --> 01:29:08,145
(Don't pretend like yours isn't wasabi rice cake.)

2376
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:09,975
- Look at him. - Gosh, I can smell it.

2377
01:29:10,416 --> 01:29:11,416
Jae Seok.

2378
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:13,916
- Jae Seok. - Brush your teeth.

2379
01:29:13,916 --> 01:29:19,786
You have wasabi on your front teeth.

2380
01:29:19,786 --> 01:29:22,786
(Wasabi colors his teeth green.)

2381
01:29:23,086 --> 01:29:24,755
I can smell wasabi from here.

2382
01:29:26,225 --> 01:29:27,265
Doesn't it make your teeth tingle?

2383
01:29:27,265 --> 01:29:30,336
(With the taste of wasabi in their mouths,)

2384
01:29:30,336 --> 01:29:33,265
(Jae Seok and Se Chan board the slingshot.)

2385
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:36,336
How should we position our heads?

2386
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,206
- My goodness. - This is happening for real.

2387
01:29:39,435 --> 01:29:41,505
They're pulling the ropes now, right?

2388
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:43,276
Make it tight like a slingshot.

2389
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:44,715
I am so scared.

2390
01:29:44,715 --> 01:29:46,076
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2391
01:29:46,076 --> 01:29:49,185
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2392
01:29:49,185 --> 01:29:52,156
(The slingshot is ready to be launched.)

2393
01:29:52,156 --> 01:29:53,725
- I am already scared. - Wait a minute.

2394
01:29:54,086 --> 01:29:55,185
- Wait a minute. - My goodness.

2395
01:29:55,286 --> 01:29:58,355
Please stop. Please stop.

2396
01:29:58,355 --> 01:30:00,095
(Please stop going up.)

2397
01:30:00,095 --> 01:30:01,566
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

2398
01:30:01,566 --> 01:30:02,925
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. - My goodness.

2399
01:30:02,925 --> 01:30:04,366
Se Chan, I feel like I am going to die.

2400
01:30:04,366 --> 01:30:05,395
- Seriously. - My goodness.

2401
01:30:05,395 --> 01:30:06,935
- Seriously. - Give us a sign.

2402
01:30:06,935 --> 01:30:07,935
My goodness.

2403
01:30:08,336 --> 01:30:10,236
- Give us a sign. - I am so scared.

2404
01:30:10,236 --> 01:30:11,276
(They are ready to go.)

2405
01:30:11,276 --> 01:30:12,276
Get ready.

2406
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:15,005
- In 1, 2. - In 1, 2.

2407
01:30:15,005 --> 01:30:16,545
(Get ready.)

2408
01:30:16,545 --> 01:30:17,545
- 3. - 3.

2409
01:30:17,545 --> 01:30:18,545
(Shoot.)

2410
01:30:18,816 --> 01:30:19,816
- 3. - 3.

2411
01:30:19,975 --> 01:30:21,885
(They are shot into the air.)

2412
01:30:22,586 --> 01:30:25,015
(The shock pushes the camera down to his face.)

2413
01:30:25,015 --> 01:30:27,626
(It gets a close look at Jae Seok's face.)

2414
01:30:38,635 --> 01:30:40,805
(They use their head voices.)

2415
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:44,105
(He is using his face incredibly well.)

2416
01:30:50,215 --> 01:30:51,576
My goodness.

2417
01:30:52,776 --> 01:30:54,416
(The sight is enough to send chills down their spines.)

2418
01:30:55,746 --> 01:30:57,656
(I am sorry, but I love you.)

2419
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:01,526
(It's never-ending.)

2420
01:31:02,885 --> 01:31:05,395
(Please save us.)

2421
01:31:10,295 --> 01:31:12,536
(Are they scared...)

2422
01:31:12,536 --> 01:31:14,465
(or excited?)

2423
01:31:14,465 --> 01:31:18,175
(Perhaps it's both.)

2424
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:19,975
Please get us down.

2425
01:31:20,145 --> 01:31:23,246
Jae Seok, look far ahead.

2426
01:31:24,015 --> 01:31:26,015
- You do that. - Look far ahead.

2427
01:31:26,215 --> 01:31:27,215
Look far ahead.

2428
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:29,715
(With much shouting, the 2nd round of Truth Game ends.)

2429
01:31:30,086 --> 01:31:32,385
(Next week)

2430
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:36,555
(Things become more intense.)

2431
01:31:36,555 --> 01:31:41,095
(Scary penalties await them.)

2432
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:46,435
(It's more thrilling.)

2433
01:31:46,435 --> 01:31:49,805
(Indonesia Manual Wooden Cable Car)

2434
01:31:50,406 --> 01:31:52,406
(Is there another penalty?)

2435
01:31:52,406 --> 01:31:55,376
(Running Man gives back to its viewers with a live broadcast.)

2436
01:31:55,376 --> 01:31:59,116
(Next Sunday at 4:50pm)
