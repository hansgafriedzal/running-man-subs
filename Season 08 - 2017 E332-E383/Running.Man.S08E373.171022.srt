1
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:08,089
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:09,929
- Hello. - This place is really pretty.

3
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:12,929
- It was in "The Beauty Inside". - That's right.

4
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,269
It's the same cafe.

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:16,229
The owner of the cafe has my respect.

6
00:00:16,229 --> 00:00:18,468
- Big respect. - Respect, respect.

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,468
So Min, you cut your bangs.

8
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,979
I cut my bangs to make myself look refresh without cutting my hair short.

9
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,078
- Why did you refresh yourself? - Did someone dump you?

10
00:00:26,078 --> 00:00:27,648
- Did something happen? - Did someone break your heart?

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,778
- You and your boyfriend broke up. - No.

12
00:00:29,848 --> 00:00:32,248
- You and your boyfriend broke up. - She is looking for another lover.

13
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:37,159
Ji Hyo, you never change your hairstyle.

14
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,318
- I don't have a change of heart. - I know.

15
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:41,428
- I always remain the same. - Seriously.

16
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,629
- You are amazing. - Ji Hyo is really like that.

17
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:44,629
- I always remain the same. - Ji Hyo remains calm...

18
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:48,329
while those around her suffer because of her.

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:50,199
Those around her suffer because of her.

20
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:52,538
- She is fine. - No matter what happens,

21
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:53,708
- she remains unaffected. - That's right.

22
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:54,939
- She is cool. - She remains unaffected.

23
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,409
- She is a strong woman. - She is incredible.

24
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:57,579
- Respect. - Big respect.

25
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:58,638
(Respect for a strong woman)

26
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:00,778
Se Chan, your face is very swollen today.

27
00:01:00,778 --> 00:01:02,049
(By the way...)

28
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:03,978
(Why is his face puffy?)

29
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:05,448
I'm not swollen, I gained weight.

30
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:06,719
(He is stressed out.)

31
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:09,988
Both Se Chan and I binge eat these days.

32
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:12,488
- New Zealand changed us. - I eat my stress away.

33
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,529
- I can't stop thinking about it. - You look better.

34
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:15,829
My face is rounder, right?

35
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:18,098
Your mouth doesn't look as protruded.

36
00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:20,098
I realized something during last week's shoot.

37
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:21,868
The members have a lot of moles on their necks.

38
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,139
- That's right. - They have moles on their necks.

39
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,738
- That's right. - I have a mole right here.

40
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:29,568
Haha, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok have them.

41
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:31,879
- Seok Jin, you don't have any. - No, I don't.

42
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,079
- You have a wart instead. - Doesn't he have a mole?

43
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,049
- What are you talking about? - You have a wart.

44
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,079
- A wart? - I don't have a wart.

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,419
- Don't grandpas get warts? - Don't say that.

46
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:40,488
You can get warts at any age.

47
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,419
Anyone can get warts.

48
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,958
- Scary grandpas get them. - The two of you are attacking me.

49
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,728
- I see a wart! - Get your hand off of me.

50
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,829
Don't cut in when we are talking.

51
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,059
(So Min and Seok Jin show off their chemistry from the start.)

52
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,098
For goodness' sake.

53
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:58,698
Thank you for working hard on various projects.

54
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,038
(Thank you for working hard on various projects.)

55
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,538
- It was nothing. - Why is he using such a warm tone?

56
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:05,309
- Seriously. - We must be done with the projects.

57
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,648
Only a few members worked hard.

58
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:08,649
That's right.

59
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:13,179
I gave Seok Jin the nickname of Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

60
00:02:13,649 --> 00:02:15,689
- He slips away from penalties. - That's right.

61
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,219
- He is incredible. - Last week,

62
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,258
I did an amazing job of slipping away.

63
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:21,959
He's so good at it.

64
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,429
To soothe your tired body and mind with a fall vacation,

65
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:29,098
we prepared "Running Man, Do Whatever You Want".

66
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,698
(Running Man's fall vacation, Do Whatever You Want)

67
00:02:31,698 --> 00:02:33,239
We are getting a vacation.

68
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,638
- Do Whatever You Want. - We are finally getting a prize.

69
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,839
Before you go,

70
00:02:38,038 --> 00:02:40,608
please write down the vacation you recommend...

71
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:44,018
to the person to your left.

72
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:46,179
Jong Kook should have sat to your left.

73
00:02:46,179 --> 00:02:47,619
Where do you want to send me?

74
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,589
Gosh, this is upsetting.

75
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,659
Let's recommend good places to each other.

76
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,758
- Let's write down what we want. - Okay.

77
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:55,629
One bad place will ruin everything.

78
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,529
- It will be a dog fight. - This isn't a penalty.

79
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,598
You are right. This is a vacation.

80
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:02,369
Kwang Soo, don't joke around with this.

81
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:04,198
I know what you've always wanted to do.

82
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,568
(Don't worry.)

83
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,268
This is for Seok Jin.

84
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,578
"From Seok Jin".

85
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:11,939
Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

86
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:13,608
(What does So Min want to do?)

87
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:16,249
I could have written down your nickname.

88
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:17,848
- Which one? - Anyang Hothead.

89
00:03:19,478 --> 00:03:20,848
- Anyang Hothead. - Anyang Hothead?

90
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,249
Anyang Hothead.

91
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,788
Sinsa-dong Mudfish and Anyang Hothead.

92
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,589
Anyang Hothead. You must think it suits you.

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,828
Jong Kook likes his new nickname.

94
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:33,568
This is perfect for you.

95
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,728
- My goodness. - It's tailored to your needs.

96
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:37,668
- Really? - Yes.

97
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:39,638
- I don't want to do anything. - You don't want to do anything.

98
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:40,939
- No. - You will get your wish.

99
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,309
- My goodness. - That's right.

100
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,339
You won't do anything.

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,309
Wait a minute.

102
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,448
Keep writing without looking in my direction.

103
00:03:48,448 --> 00:03:49,649
(Urgent)

104
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,318
- You look a bit like Han Hyo Joo. - Who?

105
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,149
(My goodness, he says I look like Han Hyo Joo.)

106
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,149
Thank you.

107
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,858
Jae Seok, why are you being annoying in the morning?

108
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:02,828
When she was looking down, she looked a bit like Han Hyo Joo.

109
00:04:02,828 --> 00:04:05,059
- How annoying! - Don't spoil her.

110
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,059
(Anyang Hothead chimes in.)

111
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,399
- Seriously. - Don't say such a thing.

112
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:12,298
From this side, her eye is this big due to a sty.

113
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:13,339
(He reveals that she has a sty.)

114
00:04:13,339 --> 00:04:14,339
Why won't it go away?

115
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:17,138
Do you have a sty? Gosh, I shook her hand earlier.

116
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:20,849
Why did you say that? Don't tell people.

117
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,408
That's right.

118
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:25,249
Kwang Soo recently hosted Kim Ki Bang's wedding.

119
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,718
- An acquaintance of mine was there. - Okay.

120
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:29,718
- How did Kwang Soo do? - I heard you did a terrible job.

121
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,789
I heard it was very boring.

122
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,088
It was my first time to get booed for hosting a wedding.

123
00:04:34,088 --> 00:04:36,359
- How is that possible? - From afar,

124
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,599
I couldn't hear what the guests were saying, but they did this.

125
00:04:39,898 --> 00:04:40,898
(That's wrong.)

126
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:43,268
- They did this. - Seriously.

127
00:04:43,268 --> 00:04:46,338
You have no right to talk about hosting a wedding.

128
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,208
- Why do you say that? - At my sister's wedding,

129
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,439
you said my father's name instead of the groom's name.

130
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,439
(Seok Jin's father almost walked down the aisle twice.)

131
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,979
He said my father's name.

132
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,179
Why did you do that?

133
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,948
- Did you finish writing? - Yes.

134
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:03,258
Hand the envelope to the person to your left.

135
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,619
Here you go.

136
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:07,658
- It contains my sincerity. - I will see what you wrote.

137
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,458
It's something you like.

138
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,859
- Really? - Really.

139
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:14,328
- I can trust you, right? - Of course you can.

140
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:17,198
- You don't have to do anything. - Don't open it yet.

141
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:20,609
Please take turns to talk about with which thoughts...

142
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,739
- you recommended the plan. - Shall we do that?

143
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,309
- Let's start with Cunning Yang. - Shall I go first?

144
00:05:24,309 --> 00:05:25,508
- Shall we start with Cunning Yang? - Cunning Yang.

145
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,049
- It's from Kwang Soo, right? - Yes, it is.

146
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,278
"Dear Se Chan. Se Chan, it's me, Kwang Soo."

147
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,919
"I am having many thoughts."

148
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,318
"What could be a vacation of your dreams?"

149
00:05:36,718 --> 00:05:39,789
"I suddenly remembered..."

150
00:05:39,818 --> 00:05:41,859
Why did you write a letter?

151
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,799
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

152
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:46,729
This is why you were terrible with hosting the wedding.

153
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:47,828
- For goodness' sake. - Why would you bring that up?

154
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,299
You shouldn't have made these unnecessary comments.

155
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:51,698
(Where is the actual recommendation?)

156
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,338
- Seriously. - This is excessive.

157
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:58,809
"I suddenly remembered something you always wanted to try."

158
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,849
- We still didn't get to the point. - This is ridiculous.

159
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:03,679
- For goodness' sake. - What is this?

160
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:06,989
It's waxing.

161
00:06:06,989 --> 00:06:08,218
(What?)

162
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:09,958
(Waxing?)

163
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:10,958
What?

164
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,789
(Am I hearing things?)

165
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:14,789
Waxing!

166
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:17,299
"Satiate your curiosity and gain confidence..."

167
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,229
- "with waxing." - Waxing!

168
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:21,528
Isn't this a penalty?

169
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:24,539
Se Chan has talked about it.

170
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,939
He was curious about waxing.

171
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,239
How much hair do you want me to remove?

172
00:06:27,239 --> 00:06:28,239
(There are different types of waxing.)

173
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:29,939
- What? - Everything?

174
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,338
Where do you want him to be waxed?

175
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:35,648
Are you referring to the Brazilian waxing?

176
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:38,218
- Come on. - Hey.

177
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,489
- Okay. Say that I got the waxing. - Well, I'm not the one getting it.

178
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,518
To whom should I show my waxed body?

179
00:06:42,888 --> 00:06:45,658
Do I have to get naked in front of you and show you my body?

180
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:48,559
- That's right. - How could you feel shy about that?

181
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:49,559
(He's disappointed.)

182
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:51,828
- It's too much. Why would I get it? - Waxing?

183
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,499
- I wrote a good one compared to it. - Hey, this vacation is...

184
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:56,299
- You should've written a good one. - This is a penalty, not a vacation.

185
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,239
No, hear me out. Se Chan really talked about getting a waxing.

186
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,568
- Kwang Soo is so weird. - What's gotten into him?

187
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:02,338
- He's gotten strange. - Are you doing this on purpose...

188
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,408
- because Jong Kook likes me? - Why are you doing this?

189
00:07:03,408 --> 00:07:04,539
That's right, you jerk.

190
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:06,809
(That's right, you jerk.)

191
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:08,708
So watch your back.

192
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:11,749
- But still, Kwang Soo. - Be grateful it was just waxing.

193
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:12,979
He got it in for me.

194
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:14,148
I was going to write shaving your head.

195
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,718
Anyway, since he wrote it, you must carry it out.

196
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,919
Whether it's your leg or some other part, you must do it.

197
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,189
- That's right. - Right.

198
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:20,888
But seriously, what is his deal with me?

199
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:21,989
(The first vacation spot gives them the chills.)

200
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,799
Gosh, Kwang Soo can be so scary.

201
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:26,129
- Compared to this, mine is great. - Kwang Soo...

202
00:07:26,429 --> 00:07:28,028
I'll read what Se Chan wrote for me.

203
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:30,099
"To my hero, Haha."

204
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:33,939
"I think you've been stressed out lately because of Nevis Swing."

205
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,939
"Since you have to get on the ride as the penalty,"

206
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:38,439
"I hoped that you would familiarize yourself with the word, 'swing'."

207
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,948
- He's in trouble. He's doomed. - Poor Haha.

208
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:43,419
"Go to a dancing studio and learn how to swing dance."

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,318
I mean it, Haha.

210
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:46,448
- This is... - You have to get on that ride.

211
00:07:46,448 --> 00:07:47,689
- I want you to get used to it. - Really?

212
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,749
You know swing dance?

213
00:07:48,749 --> 00:07:50,689
- He can learn how to jive or rumba. - That's too harsh.

214
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:52,318
- Swing dance... - Actually, Haha and I learned...

215
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:55,328
- them on a show back in the days. - I learned the cha-cha dance.

216
00:07:55,328 --> 00:07:57,599
- You'll be fine. - You have a knack for dancing.

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,698
- Get comfortable with it. - He must be cool to look good.

218
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,429
You'll look cool.

219
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:02,568
Goodness, what a bad move.

220
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:05,539
- So it just rhymed with "swing". - Right.

221
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:07,568
- It rhymes with Nevis Swing. - But that was witty, Se Chan.

222
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:08,908
- It was, wasn't it? - Yes, it was.

223
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:09,979
- Thank you. - Sure.

224
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,439
You like everything he says, don't you?

225
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,609
Well, waxing was good too.

226
00:08:13,549 --> 00:08:14,708
What about Ji Hyo's?

227
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,078
Well, mine is...

228
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,349
Ji Hyo likes sleeping.

229
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:20,549
- My gosh. - She likes it.

230
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:22,789
- I guess it's a good one. - "To Ji Hyo, my neighbor."

231
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:25,419
"It seems like you can never get enough sleep."

232
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,729
"This place is perfect for you to take a long nap."

233
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,528
- "Go to a sleeping cafe." - Seriously? She's going to sleep?

234
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:32,999
- Haha really wrote that. - "Sleep tight and rest."

235
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,898
- That's such a great one. - Can she really do that though?

236
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:36,298
- It's good for her, - This week,

237
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,938
- but what about the show? - she won't get any air time.

238
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:41,038
- Do you not want her on the show? - Really?

239
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:43,839
- Is that what you want? - I'll be on the show for a second.

240
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,379
No. Imagine how funny it'd be if you were to have sleep paralysis.

241
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,449
But I never get sleep paralysis.

242
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:49,648
(This will be enough for your air time.)

243
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:51,819
- You just look silly like that. - He can write that?

244
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:54,188
- Goodness, this is... - But he really...

245
00:08:54,388 --> 00:08:55,619
thought about Ji Hyo.

246
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,418
- You should sleep talk. - That's right.

247
00:08:57,418 --> 00:09:00,089
- You're tired today. It's perfect. - That sounds like fun.

248
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:01,388
- Shall I read mine? - Yes.

249
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,888
- Isn't that a good one? - It is.

250
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:04,158
Ji Hyo wrote this, right?

251
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:05,599
- I did. - What is it?

252
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,329
Hold on. Gosh.

253
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:09,499
- What is it? - I bet it's ramyeon.

254
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:10,739
- Does he have to eat ramyeon? - No.

255
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,499
- If I were to write his... - I was serious about this.

256
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:13,668
- I wrote this for you. - That's a long letter.

257
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:14,938
Jong Kook, read it.

258
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:16,908
"Kim Jong Kook".

259
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,148
- My letter isn't affectionate. - Goodness.

260
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,579
She just wrote, "Kim Jong Kook".

261
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,048
- I like that. - Ji Hyo.

262
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,048
- Ji Hyo. - Was she challenging him?

263
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,388
- "Kim Jong Kook". - But...

264
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,418
I like how plain it sounds. She just wrote his name.

265
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,589
- That's right. - I hate those endearments.

266
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,388
"To Jong Kook, the health promoter".

267
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,459
"I want you to eat sweet potatoes as they are in season now."

268
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:38,558
That's nice.

269
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,569
- You like sweet potatoes. - "Go to a sweet potato farm."

270
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,469
(Go to a sweet potato farm.)

271
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,739
"Dig sweet potatoes yourself."

272
00:09:46,099 --> 00:09:48,209
- He likes healthy food. - That's right.

273
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:51,138
- You can work out while digging. - Hey, she's right.

274
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,739
- Get some fresh air. - I hate things like this.

275
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,008
You know what I mean?

276
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,579
I hate doing small stuff.

277
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:59,648
- I rather do something big. - Like trivial tasks?

278
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,688
- Hey. - Like trivial tasks?

279
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,758
- I really hate doing those. - When you grab the stem...

280
00:10:03,888 --> 00:10:06,158
- I'll read what Jong Kook wrote. - Learning to swing dance is good.

281
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:09,459
"To Jae Seok. You love eating noodles."

282
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,829
- He does. - "Jae Seok."

283
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,129
- I was really thoughtful. - "You especially like ramyeon."

284
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,499
Go to a ramyeon buffet and eat as much ramyeon as you want.

285
00:10:15,798 --> 00:10:17,869
"Let's get it!" I love this.

286
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,369
- There's a ramyeon buffet? - You want me to eat ramyeon?

287
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,569
- This place actually exists? - There's such place?

288
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:23,678
- This is it. This is a good one. - Jong Kook gave me a good one.

289
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:25,678
- I knew he likes eating noodles. - Thank you.

290
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:26,749
(This is how he takes care of Jae Seok.)

291
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:28,678
This is amazing.

292
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,018
I really want to visit that buffet.

293
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,479
- I'm really curious about it too. - I want to go there too.

294
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,749
Jong Kook is being so nice to Jae Seok.

295
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:34,548
Then I'll change mine to the ramyeon buffet too.

296
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:35,589
No, leave it.

297
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:38,518
(When have you ever seen me eating ramyeon?)

298
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,829
- It's time to read mine now. - I'm sure you'll like what I wrote.

299
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:43,359
- Jae Seok wrote it for you. - Jae Seok annoys me.

300
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:45,099
- I'm sure you'll like it. - I wonder what he wrote.

301
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:48,528
"To Seok Jin, Sinsa-dong Mudfish".

302
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:49,938
"Fishing..."

303
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:51,638
- You want me to go fishing? - Yes.

304
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:53,638
- I hate fishing. - What's wrong with him?

305
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,739
- I know that he hates fishing. - Hey.

306
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,778
There are tons of fish at Noryangjin Market.

307
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:59,109
- You should go fishing. - As soon as I heard it,

308
00:10:59,109 --> 00:11:02,148
- I started yawning. - "Go fishing. Catch fresh seafood."

309
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,079
- "Cook seafood ramyeon." - That's right.

310
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,719
And this is his favorite part.

311
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,349
This is the best part of it.

312
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,219
"Lie down as you look up to the sky and hum."

313
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,959
It's a description of a mad man.

314
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,028
- Hey. - "Look up the sky"?

315
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,499
- Are you in your right mind? - This is what I'm talking about.

316
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:20,168
- He likes lying down. - That's true.

317
00:11:20,168 --> 00:11:22,528
When he lies down, he starts humming.

318
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:23,538
(It's a personalized vacation for him.)

319
00:11:24,469 --> 00:11:26,499
- Who knows? Kwang Soo... - All right.

320
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:29,308
I gave her a good one. Right before the shoot, she told me...

321
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:30,538
that she didn't want to do anything.

322
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:31,538
- Hey, read yours. - Shall we hear yours?

323
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:33,408
"To So Min".

324
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:36,879
"So Min, you always talk and chat like a parrot relentlessly."

325
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,979
- That sounds affectionate. - "I bet it's hard to always talk."

326
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,589
"So I found the perfect vacation for you to relax."

327
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,758
- This sounds caring. - "It's temple stay."

328
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:45,859
- That's nice. - Temple stay.

329
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:47,258
"Get yourself sorted out there."

330
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,658
- "Try the practice of silence." - She can go to the temple.

331
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:50,058
- That would be so hard for her. - "And declutter..."

332
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,258
- "your mind." - That will be so frustrating.

333
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,528
The letter just sounds caring,

334
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,829
but in the end, he told her to be quiet.

335
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,168
(The letter sounds caring, but in the end, he told her to be quiet.)

336
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,168
I guess two of our female members will be very quiet.

337
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,209
- That's right. - One of them will be sleeping.

338
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,508
- So Min wrote this letter. - I can't wait to hear this one.

339
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:08,908
"To Kwang Soo".

340
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,379
"Kwang Soo, you're working hard."

341
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,018
"I heard prawns are in season now."

342
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:15,918
He's going to catch prawns.

343
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:18,089
- You're making him catch prawns. - "I saw..."

344
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:21,788
"I saw that you really enjoyed eating shrimps in Indonesia."

345
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,158
"People are picking pen shells in the mudflat near the West Sea."

346
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:27,168
"Pick a lot of pen shells."

347
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,099
"And prawns and their shells are great for your joints."

348
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:31,538
"I hope you can enjoy your vacation as you eat the heads too."

349
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:32,869
- You have to eat the heads too. - What is he doing?

350
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:35,008
We'll get to see the mudflat. It's been a while.

351
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,339
He has to pick prawns.

352
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,278
She wants me to go to the mudflat and pick pen shells?

353
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:42,109
When you sprinkle the salt, they come up. You can pick them then.

354
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,178
Anyway, he can do that. I'm glad mine is great.

355
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:46,319
- Everyone will be on their own? - Will we be by ourselves?

356
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:48,589
- Put recommended vacation spots... - This is great.

357
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,489
back into the envelopes and hand over them to me.

358
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:51,859
You're not going to mix these letters, right?

359
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:53,188
I've never gotten such a good one.

360
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:54,629
I just got the chills.

361
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,658
- Se Chan. - Am I right?

362
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,999
- Why? - No way. They wouldn't do that.

363
00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:00,129
- What is it? - What is it?

364
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:02,729
- They might mix those. - Can I eat temple food there?

365
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,499
- We might pick one of those? - But...

366
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,668
- what if Jong Kook... - If we do pick one...

367
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:07,709
What if Jong Kook picks the one with ramyeon buffet?

368
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:09,869
- That's feasible. - I really want to eat...

369
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:10,938
- ramyeon. - That's right.

370
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:13,278
If I do choose the ramyeon buffet, I'm doomed.

371
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:15,749
- This is good. Let's go! - It's a penalty for him.

372
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:17,079
Ramyeon buffet.

373
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,648
Now, I will...

374
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,589
tell you the rules of Do Whatever You Want, the fall vacation...

375
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:24,359
- for our Running Man's members. - What is it?

376
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:26,928
There are eight vacation spots that you recommended for each other.

377
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:30,729
(There are 8 vacation spots that you recommended for each other.)

378
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:35,229
Those are the vacation spots that all of you will...

379
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,869
- enjoy together. - I knew it.

380
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,168
- Didn't I tell you? - It was for the member next to me.

381
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,709
You said it was for the member sitting next to me.

382
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:45,239
Among these 8 vacation spots, you will draw 5 randomly.

383
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,749
Among these 8 vacation spots, you will draw 5 randomly.

384
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,209
(They will draw 5 vacation spots randomly.)

385
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,678
- This is crazy. - We're in trouble.

386
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:52,949
- What if we get the waxing? - Waxing? You little...

387
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:55,119
- Kwang Soo. - I didn't know we all would get it.

388
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:57,219
I don't like learning how to swing dance too.

389
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:00,758
You will have only eight hours to finish them.

390
00:14:00,758 --> 00:14:02,258
(They only have 8 hours for their vacation.)

391
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,629
Within the given time, you can enjoy...

392
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,428
your vacation with the budget of 1,000 dollars.

393
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,798
- 1,000 dollars? - The sleeping cafe will be great.

394
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:12,398
That'd be awesome. We can eat everything there.

395
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:17,109
However, if you fail to enjoy five of your vacations in time...

396
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,879
or if you fail to spend all of the budget,

397
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,379
you must come up with 1,000 dollars and return the money to us.

398
00:14:23,379 --> 00:14:26,048
(If they fail, they must return 1,000 dollars to the crew.)

399
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:27,589
We have to use up the money.

400
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:28,949
1,000 dollars won't be hard.

401
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:32,459
We have chance cards that will help you maximize your experience.

402
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:33,989
- What are those? - Please discuss among yourselves.

403
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:35,989
- And use them at critical moments. - We have chance cards?

404
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:38,158
We have the dividing card.

405
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:39,528
- Dividing card? - What is that?

406
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:42,829
8 of you can split into 2, and go to 2 vacation spots simultaneously.

407
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:44,099
(They can go to 2 vacation spots at once.)

408
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:45,768
We also have the deleting card.

409
00:14:46,438 --> 00:14:47,969
- That's nice. - This is the best one.

410
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,808
And another one is the recommendation card.

411
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,839
You can call your acquaintance and change the vacation spot.

412
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:53,908
(Recommendation card)

413
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,308
And you have the dud card.

414
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:57,319
(They won't get anything from it.)

415
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,518
We'll get nothing from that.

416
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,918
- Choose one. - Okay. I'll get us a good one.

417
00:15:00,918 --> 00:15:03,188
(Kwang Soo will choose the first vacation spot.)

418
00:15:03,288 --> 00:15:04,288
Kwang Soo's choosing.

419
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:05,859
(Waxing, swing dance, sleeping cafe, picking sweet potatoes,)

420
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:07,528
(ramyeon buffet, temple stay, fishing, and catching shrimps)

421
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:10,058
- We never know... - I chose the middle one.

422
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:11,959
I rather go fishing.

423
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,829
Look at his face. Goodness.

424
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:15,999
- I guess it's a bad one. - What is it?

425
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:17,599
- I knew you'd pick a bad one. - Is it waxing?

426
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,839
Is it really waxing?

427
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,908
- What is it? - What is it?

428
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:22,008
Sweet potatoes...

429
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:24,038
(It's picking sweet potatoes.)

430
00:15:24,038 --> 00:15:25,038
Sweet potatoes.

431
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,278
Goodness, what's wrong with that guy?

432
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,008
We have to pick them from the field.

433
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:32,678
- Se Chan, choose one. - Can I?

434
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:34,188
You picked the sweet potatoes.

435
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,089
- The five vacation spots... - Get the sleeping cafe or buffet.

436
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:38,459
- Just don't get the waxing. - Don't pick the waxing.

437
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,329
(Please let's just make sure we don't get waxing.)

438
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,688
- Hey, what is it? - Make sure it's not waxing.

439
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:43,999
You can't choose waxing.

440
00:15:44,798 --> 00:15:46,569
(As he sighs, he sinks his head.)

441
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:49,268
(What is the vacation spot Se Chan has chosen?)

442
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:51,798
I'm sorry. My name is on this letter.

443
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:53,908
- What is it? - Is it the swing dance?

444
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,239
No, it's waxing.

445
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,739
(His name implies that they have a chance to get waxing.)

446
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,138
(We have to get our hair waxed together?)

447
00:15:58,138 --> 00:15:59,209
Seriously?

448
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,278
- All of us have to do it. - How could you pick that one?

449
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,918
How could you pick that one? And why did you write that?

450
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,778
I don't have any hair to shave.

451
00:16:06,349 --> 00:16:08,288
Let's use the chance for the waxing.

452
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:10,888
I have the perfect amount of hair right now.

453
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,188
(The one who recommended waxing committed the biggest crime.)

454
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:14,258
Exactly.

455
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,158
Once you start waxing, you have to get it regularly.

456
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,798
- What's the third one? - Let's use the chance card.

457
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:18,928
It's not that...

458
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:21,099
Why did you do that?

459
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,168
What is it?

460
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:23,699
(Did Ji Hyo pick a bad vacation spot too?)

461
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:24,768
- Ji Hyo, what is it? - Ji Hyo.

462
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,569
- It's Haha's. - I'm sorry, Haha.

463
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,008
- Is it the swing dance? - It's the swing dance.

464
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:29,268
(It's the swing dance.)

465
00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:31,638
- This episode won't be any fun. - Goodness.

466
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:33,249
Jong Kook.

467
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,849
- Goodness. - I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

468
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,678
Let me pick one myself.

469
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:39,819
We've picked the worst options so far.

470
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,489
- Exactly. - We have the worst ones.

471
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,119
- Gosh. - It's the fourth choice.

472
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:44,388
Waxing is too much.

473
00:16:44,388 --> 00:16:45,918
- I'll make sure to pick ramyeon. - Okay.

474
00:16:45,918 --> 00:16:47,688
- Please. - Ramyeon.

475
00:16:47,688 --> 00:16:50,028
- Please. - We need at least one good place.

476
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:53,028
(He reacts loudly after checking his choice.)

477
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,099
- What is it? - Is it ramyeon?

478
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:56,469
- What is it? - Is it ramyeon?

479
00:16:56,469 --> 00:16:57,569
It's ramyeon buffet!

480
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:59,069
(Jae Seok chose the ramyeon buffet.)

481
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,408
- Yes! - Nice.

482
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:04,309
- Respect. - Good job.

483
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:05,609
- It's your turn now. - Respect!

484
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,648
- We respect Jae Seok. - Respect.

485
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:09,648
Let's go have some ramyeon.

486
00:17:09,648 --> 00:17:11,019
- He's Superman. - I chose ramyeon.

487
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:13,819
- Thank goodness I picked this. - Goodness.

488
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,188
- It's like the oasis in a desert. - But Jong Kook doesn't like it.

489
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,589
What else do we have left? She shouldn't pick prawn fishing.

490
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,859
- It's vow of silence, right? - Are we going to ride a boat?

491
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,428
- What is it? - What should we do?

492
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,859
- What is it? - So it's prawn fishing.

493
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,198
(What's their last vacation spot?)

494
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,968
It's Sinsa-dong Mudfish, fishing.

495
00:17:27,968 --> 00:17:29,898
(She has picked fishing.)

496
00:17:29,898 --> 00:17:31,539
- How are we supposed to... - It's fishing?

497
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:32,769
- It's fishing? - Yes.

498
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,269
Do we have to have ramyeon again?

499
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,738
- You wrote that. - We have ramyeon buffet too.

500
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:39,678
- Let's go have some ramyeon first. - Good.

501
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:44,079
Please decide the order first before you start your vacation.

502
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,748
- Let's eat first. - Ramyeon.

503
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:47,218
Let's make waxing the last to do.

504
00:17:47,218 --> 00:17:49,718
Let's use the chance card to get rid of it later.

505
00:17:49,718 --> 00:17:51,488
- Let's get rid of it from the list. - Put the strange ones at the back.

506
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,119
That waxing is the worst to be honest.

507
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:55,228
- Right. - Why did you write that?

508
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,388
Let's go to the sweet potato farm first.

509
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:57,698
- Good idea. - All right.

510
00:17:57,698 --> 00:18:00,829
Let's do a physical activity first and go to fill ourselves.

511
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,928
- Then the fishing. - Let's go fishing after.

512
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:05,369
Let's cross out swing dance and waxing from the list later on.

513
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,339
- We'll go pick sweet potatoes. - Right.

514
00:18:07,708 --> 00:18:09,908
I'll search if there's any sweet potato farm in Incheon.

515
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:13,079
We'll help you find available places if you can't.

516
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,879
- Will there be any? - It should be located around here.

517
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:18,319
There's a farm that provides picking experiences for people.

518
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,089
- A sweet potato farm in Incheon. - I found one too.

519
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,218
- Where is it located? - It should be somewhere near here.

520
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,188
They aren't answering. Hello?

521
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:27,089
- Hello? - Is it the sweet potato farm?

522
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,859
- Yes. - Are you open today?

523
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,728
- From 1pm today. - From 1pm?

524
00:18:31,728 --> 00:18:33,629
- Can we pick sweet potatoes? - It's too late.

525
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,829
- We should change schedule then. - Yes.

526
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,839
- We'll call you later. - Thank you.

527
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,998
- We have to use the GPS. - Bye.

528
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,238
But this place is open from 1pm. What time is it now?

529
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:41,369
- It's 10am. - That's...

530
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,569
- It's too late then. - We need to go right now.

531
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:45,309
And the sun will be high up in the sky around 1pm.

532
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:46,438
- It'll be hot. - It'll be extremely hot.

533
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:47,978
- We might get sunstroke. - It's better in the morning.

534
00:18:47,978 --> 00:18:49,208
- I'll try calling them. - Try it.

535
00:18:49,408 --> 00:18:50,849
Kwang Soo, try it.

536
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,148
(He tries calling another farm.)

537
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:53,688
You won't be able to host the wedding. Are you okay with that?

538
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:54,918
What?

539
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,658
- Can you tell them? - Sure.

540
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,418
The music.

541
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:00,988
The music is nice.

542
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,488
(She starts dancing.)

543
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:03,859
It goes well with the farm.

544
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,398
Goodness.

545
00:19:07,998 --> 00:19:09,398
(They're impossible.)

546
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:11,968
Hello?

547
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,138
- Is this the sweet potato farm? - Yes.

548
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,738
- Are you open today? - Yes.

549
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,648
- From what time? - Ask him if we can go now.

550
00:19:20,648 --> 00:19:22,609
From what time are you open?

551
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,678
We're open from the morning.

552
00:19:26,349 --> 00:19:27,948
Can we go right now?

553
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:29,319
Ask him if it's okay to shoot there.

554
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:31,259
- Tell him we're Running Man. - Is it okay...

555
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,829
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo of Running Man.

556
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:36,559
(The owner stays silent.)

557
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,099
It seems like he doesn't know who Kwang Soo is.

558
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,769
I don't think he knows you.

559
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:42,898
Hold on. I'll let you talk to the famous person.

560
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,339
Kwang Soo, you better work harder.

561
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:48,609
Hello, sir. I'm Yu Jae Seok of Running Man.

562
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:50,779
Oh, hello.

563
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,478
- See? He responded differently. - It's different.

564
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,408
- He recognized Jae Seok right away. - Goodness.

565
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,579
We're filming the show at the moment,

566
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,888
and we have to find a farm in which we can pick sweet potatoes.

567
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:02,948
Can we go with our filming crew?

568
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:04,289
Yes, of course.

569
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,188
Goodness, thank you. We'll head there right now then.

570
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:09,529
- Okay, call me when you're here. - Okay.

571
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,629
Thank you.

572
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:11,658
Good.

573
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,228
- We respect him. - He said okay right away.

574
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:14,599
- Respect. - Goodness.

575
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,369
- Respect! - Respect.

576
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,869
(Should I go pick sweet potatoes in Indonesia?)

577
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:21,738
- Let's go. - Let's go.

578
00:20:21,938 --> 00:20:24,079
- Get it. - Let's get it.

579
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,478
- We'll pick sweet potatoes, right? - Yes.

580
00:20:26,478 --> 00:20:27,708
Let's get it.

581
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:30,948
- I'm so excited to have ramyeon. - Me too.

582
00:20:30,978 --> 00:20:32,718
I didn't know there was a buffet for ramyeon.

583
00:20:32,718 --> 00:20:34,289
I might have ramyeon in a long time.

584
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,519
- Really? - Jong Kook.

585
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,089
I'll put chicken breast in your ramyeon.

586
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:39,158
(Will it be healthy food then?)

587
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:42,089
So Min, I'd love that.

588
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,259
(They're excited to be on their relaxing vacation.)

589
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:46,569
Join in.

590
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:52,569
(We're on our vacation today.)

591
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:57,309
By the way, waxing is too...

592
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:58,509
Kwang Soo wrote that.

593
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,009
(Who recommended waxing?)

594
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,978
That's too much.

595
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,349
Right. Or go do it alone.

596
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,648
We can use the chance card later.

597
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,049
- Get your body waxed. - Or we have to go together.

598
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:09,349
- What? - Goodness.

599
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,218
We have to spend all 1,000 dollars.

600
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:13,559
Shouldn't we buy a huge sack to put in sweet potatoes then?

601
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:15,888
- Right. - We should pick a lot of them.

602
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:18,359
We have to pick a lot of them.

603
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,168
I'm so curious to know by the way.

604
00:21:21,168 --> 00:21:22,498
Why is this a relaxing vacation?

605
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,668
(He comes to wonder suddenly.)

606
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,468
- What is? - This.

607
00:21:26,468 --> 00:21:27,708
Why is this a vacation?

608
00:21:27,968 --> 00:21:30,408
I just don't get why she wrote that for me.

609
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,908
What do you mean? I wrote it for you.

610
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,549
Sweet potatoes...

611
00:21:35,009 --> 00:21:37,849
I did a good job in writing fishing.

612
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,488
Hey, it takes much time to catch fish.

613
00:21:40,488 --> 00:21:41,988
It's only a waste of time.

614
00:21:41,988 --> 00:21:44,819
- I'm a master of fishing. - What are you talking about?

615
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:47,488
Don't lie, Jae Seok.

616
00:21:47,488 --> 00:21:49,129
I'm like a fisherman.

617
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,559
They call me a fisherman in the field.

618
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:55,629
When we went to fishing, everyone caught fish except for you.

619
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:59,599
(3 years ago)

620
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:06,478
(The members caught big fish here and there.)

621
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:09,279
(Reeling)

622
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,279
(He failed to catch fish alone.)

623
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,218
(Jae Seok was the only one who couldn't catch anything.)

624
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:17,388
When will I get to catch something?

625
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,658
I'll show you this time.

626
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:23,188
I'll show you what fishing is.

627
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,759
- Shall we bring it on today? - Goodness.

628
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:29,998
I'll show you the difference between an amateur and an expert.

629
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:32,299
If you fail to catch at least one, you will get somewhere waxed.

630
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:34,208
- Deal? - Goodness.

631
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,839
Then it'll become a penalty. Let's go first and talk later.

632
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,079
Why are you stepping back?

633
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,948
- Are you not confident? - Why are you getting upset?

634
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:44,049
Goodness, get off.

635
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:46,049
This isn't your car.

636
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:48,319
- I'm driving, so get off. - This isn't your car.

637
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,859
It's not my car, but I'm driving this car, so get off.

638
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,488
Let him off at the crossroad over there.

639
00:22:52,488 --> 00:22:54,228
- Right. - Drop him off there.

640
00:22:54,228 --> 00:22:56,698
Take a taxi and come to the farm.

641
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:58,599
(They're on their way to the farm.)

642
00:22:59,898 --> 00:23:00,928
We're here.

643
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,898
It feels like there's the sweet potato farm somewhere around here.

644
00:23:02,898 --> 00:23:04,369
- We're here. - Goodness.

645
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:06,069
Here it is.

646
00:23:06,269 --> 00:23:08,009
Let's pick sweet potatoes, and leave here quickly.

647
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,539
Let's pick them quickly, and get some ramyeon.

648
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:10,809
Let's not waste time here.

649
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:12,839
I've never picked sweet potatoes before.

650
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:16,408
(Try our delicious sweet potatoes.)

651
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:18,379
It's the first course of your vacation.

652
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:21,049
It's what Ji Hyo recommends to Jong Kook.

653
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:22,519
(The first course is the sweet potato farm.)

654
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:25,019
Before you start enjoying your vacation, there's one announcement.

655
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:26,928
Please come in.

656
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:28,329
- What? - What's coming in?

657
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:30,398
Perhaps, we have to choose tools.

658
00:23:30,498 --> 00:23:32,498
- No way. - No way.

659
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:36,228
(They're getting suspicious.)

660
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:38,839
Gosh, it's a roulette again.

661
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:40,208
It's a roulette.

662
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,138
- Is it a roulette again? - What is it?

663
00:23:42,138 --> 00:23:44,178
(They have a bad feeling about this.)

664
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,208
- What is this? - "Company credit card".

665
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,509
- What is this? - We might have to pay for this.

666
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:50,319
- We might have to pay for this. - Goodness.

667
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,418
You told us to use the 1,000 dollars. What is this now?

668
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:55,819
(What is this suspicious roulette for?)

669
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:56,888
All right, guys.

670
00:23:56,888 --> 00:24:00,988
You have to use up 1,000 dollars throughout the five courses.

671
00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:05,228
The roulette is fairly divided by your names and the company card.

672
00:24:05,398 --> 00:24:07,569
After you finish enjoying each course, you'll spin the roulette,

673
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:10,369
and the chosen person will pay for the expenses.

674
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:11,668
(They'll spin the roulette to decide whom will pay for each course.)

675
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:12,998
- I mean... - What is this?

676
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:15,069
I thought we were going to have a relaxing vacation.

677
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:16,138
Isn't this a vacation?

678
00:24:16,138 --> 00:24:19,039
If you don't wish to spin the roulette,

679
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,809
- do you see the box over there? - Yes.

680
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:22,279
It's the golden bell box.

681
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,178
(Golden bell box)

682
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:28,519
Until you fill this sack with sweet potatoes,

683
00:24:28,748 --> 00:24:32,019
vote for one member whom you want to pay for the course.

684
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:36,529
(They'll write a member's name in secret and put it in the box.)

685
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:39,599
- In secret? - Any kind of paper is fine.

686
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,198
Write someone's name on a piece of paper and put it in the box.

687
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:43,398
That person will pay for the course.

688
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,668
If there are several pieces of paper inside the box...

689
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:47,738
That's why I was given a pen.

690
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:49,438
If it's one person, will that person pay for the course?

691
00:24:49,438 --> 00:24:51,408
That's right. If there are several papers,

692
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,349
we'll draw one among them.

693
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:55,648
Let's just go for the company card.

694
00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:57,379
- Right, let's hold hands. - The company card.

695
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,678
Right? Let's not write names.

696
00:24:58,678 --> 00:25:00,148
Why are you trying to write a name already?

697
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:01,388
I just want to ask a question.

698
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,988
Is it okay to write a name on here?

699
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:04,759
- Don't do this. - Let's not write names.

700
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,789
Let's go for the company card.

701
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,359
Let's spin the roulette.

702
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:11,129
We'll leave the roulette and the box here.

703
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:13,428
Enjoy picking sweet potatoes.

704
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,928
(They shouldn't vote for anyone if they want to use the company card.)

705
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:16,769
- Let's go pick sweet potatoes. - Right.

706
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:19,839
We're going to the ramyeon buffet, so we shouldn't waste time here.

707
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,039
- Right. - Okay.

708
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:22,208
Let's go.

709
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,539
- Where do we get the tools? - We should eat ramyeon.

710
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,309
So Min.

711
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:27,708
- Goodness. - What are you doing?

712
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:28,809
It's nothing.

713
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,148
You guys are too much.

714
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:34,849
(Who will get to pay for the first course?)

715
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:36,888
- We're running out of time. - That's right.

716
00:25:36,988 --> 00:25:38,759
We don't have much time.

717
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,928
Where should I dig? Here?

718
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,928
All right, guys. Look here.

719
00:25:43,228 --> 00:25:44,228
You guys...

720
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:46,099
haven't picked sweet potatoes before, right?

721
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:48,129
Have you?

722
00:25:48,428 --> 00:25:49,529
Have you?

723
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,599
I'm experienced with everything.

724
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,769
I'm the master of fishing and picking sweet potatoes.

725
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:57,178
About 10 years ago from now...

726
00:25:57,178 --> 00:25:59,408
Stop talking nonsense and just pick sweet potatoes.

727
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:00,579
Well...

728
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:03,009
Ji Hyo!

729
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:05,148
- There are so many here. - Where?

730
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,589
It's nice here.

731
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,748
(They have found a place with a lot of sweet potatoes.)

732
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:10,619
Se Chan, you're no joke.

733
00:26:10,888 --> 00:26:12,059
Ji Hyo.

734
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:18,759
Check this out. It's long just like Kwang Soo.

735
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,728
- Come on. - It looks like Kwang Soo.

736
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:21,928
I don't look like that.

737
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:24,069
You look exactly like this.

738
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:26,809
Check this out. It's like Seok Jin.

739
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:28,638
It's like Seok Jin.

740
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:30,208
(Ta-da. Doesn't it look like Seok Jin?)

741
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,138
What? How does that look like me?

742
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:33,138
It sort of does.

743
00:26:33,648 --> 00:26:34,708
Look over here.

744
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:36,379
(Their friendship grows through the experience.)

745
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:37,978
Hey.

746
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:41,019
Gosh, look at this.

747
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:42,619
It's easy to dig them out.

748
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:44,759
We're doing very well.

749
00:26:44,888 --> 00:26:46,829
- This is great. - Isn't it?

750
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:48,728
- There's a lot. - Dig here, Se Chan.

751
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:50,228
I'll do it.

752
00:26:50,228 --> 00:26:51,958
(He volunteers to help.)

753
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,529
I've done everything.

754
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:55,698
- Dig over here. - We're doing very well.

755
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,968
(The sweet potato expert shows off.)

756
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,938
- You're so good at shoveling. - I know.

757
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:01,069
Jae Seok is good at shoveling.

758
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:04,109
I've done it for 10 years.

759
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,708
(His talent is shoveling.)

760
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:10,079
(He conquers all the sweet potato fields.)

761
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,718
- There are no sweet potatoes. - Why not?

762
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:14,248
There aren't any over here.

763
00:27:14,388 --> 00:27:15,849
- There aren't any. - Dig over here.

764
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,388
There aren't any where Jae Seok is digging.

765
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,888
- I found some. - Where?

766
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:25,398
(Is the expert finally showing off his skills?)

767
00:27:26,869 --> 00:27:28,769
(Screaming in joy)

768
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:30,539
(That's tiny.)

769
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:31,869
It's so small.

770
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:34,809
(On the contrary, he finds a small sweet potato.)

771
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:36,168
What's that, Jae Seok?

772
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:39,978
I let them go because they're too small.

773
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:40,978
(It's not worth it.)

774
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:42,849
(The others find big ones.)

775
00:27:42,849 --> 00:27:44,549
- I got lucky. - Goodness.

776
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:47,388
- They're here. It's so small. - I know.

777
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:49,918
Look how small it is,

778
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,789
but they found big ones.

779
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:52,958
It's this small.

780
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,759
(Look how small it is.)

781
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,458
They're so small.

782
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,829
Am I responsible for that?

783
00:27:58,829 --> 00:28:02,269
No, but they found big ones over there.

784
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:03,539
(He gets discouraged.)

785
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,539
Why can't I find any here?

786
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,869
- It's strange. - There aren't any.

787
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:09,238
These are so small.

788
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:11,039
Goodness.

789
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,648
Guys, look at these. Jae Seok's are so tiny.

790
00:28:16,849 --> 00:28:19,579
So Min, be careful what you say.

791
00:28:20,218 --> 00:28:21,388
Be careful what you say.

792
00:28:21,748 --> 00:28:24,188
The sweet potatoes that Jae Seok found...

793
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:25,759
(Make yourself clear.)

794
00:28:26,158 --> 00:28:28,289
So Min, what are you saying?

795
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:30,158
Jae Seok's are so tiny.

796
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:31,958
So Min!

797
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,269
Are you out of your mind?

798
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:35,269
(Speak accurately.)

799
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:36,468
Hey.

800
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,668
- These are big. - I feel so proud.

801
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,908
There are only big ones.

802
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:42,968
Let me see.

803
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,208
(Why are they so small over here?)

804
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,279
Why are the sweet potatoes so tiny?

805
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,178
(Why are they so small over here?)

806
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,178
Look at this.

807
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,119
Isn't it cute?

808
00:28:56,089 --> 00:28:57,259
Gosh, this is big.

809
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,188
- Good ones are over here. - Right.

810
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:02,789
Big ones are over here.

811
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:05,658
I'm quite experienced with digging sweet potatoes.

812
00:29:06,529 --> 00:29:08,698
I'll show you my expertise in fishing.

813
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:09,968
I found more.

814
00:29:10,269 --> 00:29:11,738
I want to go somewhere.

815
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:12,968
(Jae Seok dreams of traveling.)

816
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,638
Based on what Ji Hyo wrote,

817
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:20,248
you must steam the sweet potatoes.

818
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,478
Steaming them takes 20 minutes. 1 of you should take some.

819
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:26,079
I'll take them now.

820
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:27,448
- I'll do it. - I will.

821
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:28,819
- I will. - No, I will.

822
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:30,458
I'll do it since I'm the youngest.

823
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,418
- No, I should do it. - I will.

824
00:29:32,658 --> 00:29:36,829
As a sweet potato veteran, I'll take them.

825
00:29:36,829 --> 00:29:38,599
- I'll do it. - Do you have mythomania?

826
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,928
Why do you say that you're good at everything?

827
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:42,668
- Let's go. - This should be enough.

828
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:45,339
- Let's go together. This is enough. - Okay, let's go.

829
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,069
- We'll be back. - See you soon.

830
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:52,978
While I shovel,

831
00:29:52,978 --> 00:29:55,178
- What are you doing? - someone should pick them.

832
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:56,178
I'll pick them.

833
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,978
Let's dig out big ones.

834
00:29:57,978 --> 00:29:59,279
(He struggles for 10 minutes.)

835
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,549
- Seriously. - So Min, can you help me?

836
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,488
Gosh, look at these.

837
00:30:05,589 --> 00:30:08,359
Hey, look how big they are.

838
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,759
Look over here.

839
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:11,998
So Min.

840
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,228
Didn't you ask me to pull it up?

841
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,968
I've been struggling to...

842
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:18,269
- take it off. - You asked to pull it up...

843
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:20,069
because you like it.

844
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,069
(It looks like a diaper.)

845
00:30:21,468 --> 00:30:22,738
My goodness.

846
00:30:23,579 --> 00:30:26,339
Gosh, I'm getting angry.

847
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:29,279
How does he find good ones?

848
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,248
Ji Hyo, look at this.

849
00:30:31,379 --> 00:30:33,079
- Gosh. - That's huge.

850
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,849
(It's big like Jong Kook.)

851
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:36,658
Look at them.

852
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:39,688
There's another one here.

853
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:41,559
It's a great exercise.

854
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,529
That's right, Jong Kook.

855
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,359
(He finishes picking sweet potatoes.)

856
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,569
Sweet potatoes are being steamed on the other side.

857
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:48,829
You may go and eat them.

858
00:30:50,569 --> 00:30:51,569
Are they done?

859
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,569
- Shall we open it? - It's been 20 minutes.

860
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:55,369
- I can smell them. - They look delicious.

861
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:56,438
Let's see.

862
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,579
(They look big and delicious.)

863
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,478
- These look amazing. - They look delicious.

864
00:31:00,478 --> 00:31:02,109
- They're cooked. - They'd be good with milk.

865
00:31:02,109 --> 00:31:03,948
- Shall we eat them? - They're ready to eat.

866
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,049
(He splits it open.)

867
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:06,948
- It's a pumpkin sweet potato. - It's golden.

868
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,549
- Take a bite. - It's golden.

869
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:10,119
- What color is it? - Be careful.

870
00:31:10,718 --> 00:31:11,988
Gosh, look at this.

871
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,728
- How is it? - It's so good.

872
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:15,988
It's not necessary to peel it.

873
00:31:16,228 --> 00:31:17,428
You can push out the inside.

874
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:20,968
- It's very sweet. - Now is the perfect time to eat.

875
00:31:21,998 --> 00:31:23,269
- It's delicious. - They'll still be good tomorrow.

876
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,698
- Be careful of your hand. - We'll give you kimchi.

877
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,539
(Even its complementary dish kimchi is served.)

878
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,109
Let's get it, let's get it.

879
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:30,478
- Why are you being nice to us? - Get it.

880
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:32,178
Look. Put it on top.

881
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:34,549
That's exactly what I'm doing.

882
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:36,549
I know what to do.

883
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:37,849
That's right.

884
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:39,218
Crunchy cucumber field?

885
00:31:39,718 --> 00:31:41,488
- Gosh. - I've never done this before.

886
00:31:41,488 --> 00:31:43,119
Ji Hyo, this was a great idea.

887
00:31:43,218 --> 00:31:44,458
It's therapeutic indeed.

888
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:45,458
Isn't it great?

889
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:48,589
- You deserve respect, Ji Hyo. - A lot of respect.

890
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:49,728
(Enjoy sweet potato picking this autumn.)

891
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,829
The drinks you have here cost a dollar each.

892
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,799
That's a good price.

893
00:31:55,869 --> 00:31:57,638
The total cost is 106 dollars.

894
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:59,168
Running Man members deserve it.

895
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,539
It's 50 dollars' worth of sweet potatoes.

896
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,069
Let's spend more.

897
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:03,478
- Come on. - We have enough.

898
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:04,809
What about our crew members?

899
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:05,809
(Let's spend a lot.)

900
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:09,109
- Really? - My goodness.

901
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,379
(He suddenly cares about the crew members.)

902
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:14,188
Here's a drink for each of you.

903
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:16,349
It's because it's not his money.

904
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,559
Does anyone want some Coke?

905
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:19,859
Take it.

906
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:22,059
He's acting like he's never met them before.

907
00:32:22,888 --> 00:32:25,359
It's okay as long as I don't pay.

908
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,629
(He hopes he doesn't get picked.)

909
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:31,269
(It's time to determine how they'll pay.)

910
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:35,238
If there are no names inside the box,

911
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:38,178
- Do we spin the roulette? - you'll spin the roulette.

912
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,549
If there is a name in the box, that person will pay.

913
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:43,549
Here we go.

914
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:44,549
Here I go.

915
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:47,349
Let's not put anyone's name in it.

916
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:49,119
- Let's trust each other. - Pay with the company card.

917
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,119
Right?

918
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:51,559
Here I go.

919
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:55,488
(There's something inside.)

920
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:59,029
It won't be necessary to carry that heavy roulette today.

921
00:32:59,998 --> 00:33:02,968
I think a war is about to break.

922
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:06,539
It's a sweet potato.

923
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,638
Is there a name on it?

924
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,638
"Yu Jae Seok".

925
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:11,678
(The first candidate is Jae Seok.)

926
00:33:11,678 --> 00:33:13,448
Whoever wrote it should be ashamed.

927
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:15,379
What is it?

928
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,079
What did you write?

929
00:33:18,148 --> 00:33:19,988
Does it look like Yu Jae Seok?

930
00:33:19,988 --> 00:33:20,988
Does it?

931
00:33:21,718 --> 00:33:22,819
We have to write it.

932
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:24,988
- This is done. - Take it off.

933
00:33:24,988 --> 00:33:26,728
All right.

934
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,428
Whoever wrote it should be ashamed.

935
00:33:28,928 --> 00:33:30,898
Gosh, it's written on a sweet potato.

936
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,059
"Beloved Kim Jong Kook".

937
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:36,099
(The second candidate is Jong Kook.)

938
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,438
It's the same handwriting as the letter to Jong Kook.

939
00:33:40,938 --> 00:33:43,438
- What? Let me see it. - What?

940
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:45,109
It's the same handwriting.

941
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,079
Was it Ji Hyo?

942
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,879
It must be Ji Hyo.

943
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:53,648
He'll know it's me if I refer to him as an older man.

944
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:56,589
(She erases it.)

945
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:01,859
I'd like Jong Kook to pay since I recommended this place.

946
00:34:01,859 --> 00:34:04,799
(Ji Hyo targets Jong Kook.)

947
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:09,429
(Were you the one who wrote my name, Ji Hyo?)

948
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,438
Okay.

949
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,969
- "Lee Kwang Soo". - "Lee Kwang Soo".

950
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,069
Me?

951
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,578
- "Kim Jong Kook". - It's a variety of people.

952
00:34:17,578 --> 00:34:18,578
"Yu Jae Seok".

953
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,449
He's picked twice.

954
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,808
"Jeon So Min".

955
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,949
There's So Min?

956
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,679
Yes. Next is "Lee Kwang Soo".

957
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,679
Is it me again?

958
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,688
- That's right. - Why is it me?

959
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,748
Is there one more?

960
00:34:29,118 --> 00:34:31,319
- It's "Yu Jae Seok". - All right.

961
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:32,788
Jae Seok has the most votes.

962
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:35,728
- Luckily, I'm not a candidate. - He's popular.

963
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,629
- Kwang Soo got 2 votes. - 2 votes.

964
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,469
I have 3 votes. Jong Kook has 2 votes.

965
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:42,629
So Min has one vote.

966
00:34:42,868 --> 00:34:45,538
How many people put a name in the box?

967
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:46,708
Eight people.

968
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:48,839
- Did everyone write? - Everyone did.

969
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:50,279
I didn't write any.

970
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:52,009
(Jong Kook says that he didn't write any.)

971
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,978
It's not that. I'm sorry.

972
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:56,949
- I thought I could write two names. - Who did you write?

973
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:59,648
(Whose name did you write?)

974
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:02,918
- Do I have to tell you? - I didn't write any.

975
00:35:02,918 --> 00:35:04,719
(Why is she looking at me?)

976
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,859
There are two leaves.

977
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:08,629
Shall I say whom I want to exclude?

978
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:10,429
Whose names did you write?

979
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:13,868
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.

980
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,469
How dare you?

981
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:17,139
- Did you write these? - So Min.

982
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,799
- I didn't write them. - So Min.

983
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:20,438
- Those aren't mine. - Did you write these?

984
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:21,839
I'll take out the stone.

985
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,839
(She takes out Kwang Soo's name.)

986
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:25,639
- Okay. - Look, I have three votes.

987
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:28,279
- I have 3 votes. - I only have 1 vote.

988
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,319
3 votes for Jae Seok, 2 votes for Jong Kook.

989
00:35:31,348 --> 00:35:33,449
- Gosh, So Min. - 1 vote for So Min and Kwang Soo.

990
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:34,489
Okay.

991
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:37,159
The person with the most votes should pick.

992
00:35:37,188 --> 00:35:38,489
It'd be funny if you pick yourself.

993
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,728
- No. - You only get one chance.

994
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:41,989
- You get one chance. - Really?

995
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:43,299
Pick one right away.

996
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:45,199
You might pick your own name.

997
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,529
(Jae Seok has the highest probability.)

998
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:50,469
(Who will pay for the costs at the sweet potato farm?)

999
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,469
Here's the name.

1000
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:54,069
One.

1001
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:58,279
(The total cost is 106 dollars.)

1002
00:35:58,279 --> 00:35:59,279
2, 3.

1003
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:02,279
(Who will pay the vacation costs?)

1004
00:36:02,279 --> 00:36:03,549
It's Kim Jong Kook.

1005
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:06,379
(Jong Kook must pay.)

1006
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,819
(He didn't get chosen.)

1007
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:10,788
Why are you doing this to me?

1008
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:14,589
Jong Kook said that the members deserve it.

1009
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,799
- Right. - Thank you for the food.

1010
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:19,359
Thank you, Jong Kook.

1011
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,998
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

1012
00:36:20,998 --> 00:36:23,469
All of us recognize this face.

1013
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:26,038
He's going to start getting angry.

1014
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:30,339
- Come on. - Anyang Hothead is coming soon.

1015
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,239
Anyang Hothead.

1016
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,148
(Before Jong Kook gets angry, sweet potato digging is finished.)

1017
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:39,748
Let's do a chance card lottery.

1018
00:36:39,748 --> 00:36:40,918
Ji Hyo, you pick one.

1019
00:36:40,918 --> 00:36:42,219
You should do it.

1020
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:43,688
Just pick one.

1021
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:45,589
I hope we can divide into two groups.

1022
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,788
Is it a dud?

1023
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:48,659
- It's a dividing card! - It's a dividing card!

1024
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:49,998
- A dividing card. - Unbelievable.

1025
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:51,228
Respect.

1026
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:52,998
Big respect.

1027
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:56,168
One team will go fishing, and the other will take a dance class.

1028
00:36:56,368 --> 00:36:57,768
My goodness.

1029
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:59,938
We'll leave the rest to chance.

1030
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:01,308
It'll be chosen randomly.

1031
00:37:01,308 --> 00:37:02,339
All right.

1032
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:03,879
I bet Kwang Soo will be taking a swing dance class.

1033
00:37:03,879 --> 00:37:05,308
Two, three.

1034
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:09,009
(Swing dance, fishing, swing dance, fishing)

1035
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:10,418
Let me see.

1036
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,319
Kwang Soo will be taking a swing dance class.

1037
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,049
Ji Hyo is taking a swing dance class.

1038
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:16,859
- I'm a bad dancer. - It'll be so cringe worthy.

1039
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,188
(They move to the second spot, expecting hardships.)

1040
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:26,299
(Team Fishing, Team Swing Dance)

1041
00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:27,699
75 dollars is a lot.

1042
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,299
Is that how much it usually costs?

1043
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:30,998
Dance classes are expensive.

1044
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,069
I see.

1045
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,268
Let's go for company card.

1046
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:35,139
- That sounds good. - Promise me.

1047
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,639
- Company card. - We have no choice.

1048
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:38,739
Promise me.

1049
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,909
Put your hand here. Otherwise, you're not with us.

1050
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,679
Let's shout, "Swing, swing, swing."

1051
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,478
- Start. Swing, swing, swing. - Swing, swing, swing.

1052
00:37:45,478 --> 00:37:46,478
Okay.

1053
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,188
- What's with your expression? - What?

1054
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:53,688
(What's that face?)

1055
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,228
Why were you smiling? Your eyes...

1056
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,398
I'm not supposed to smile on a variety show?

1057
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,498
- I can't believe this. - We're here to relax.

1058
00:38:04,898 --> 00:38:07,009
- Today's theme is relaxing. - I give up.

1059
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,609
- Stop it. - I give up.

1060
00:38:08,609 --> 00:38:10,478
We have to go for company card.

1061
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:12,009
(Will Team Swing Dance be all right?)

1062
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,279
We have to pay 400 dollars.

1063
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:15,879
Not everyone has to catch one.

1064
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:16,879
No.

1065
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,379
As soon as we catch one,

1066
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:21,089
- we'll make ramyeon. - We'll make ramyeon with it.

1067
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,389
Wink at that car.

1068
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,788
- Why? - It's a beat-up car.

1069
00:38:24,918 --> 00:38:27,089
Gosh, she's making us wink at a beat-up car again.

1070
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:29,029
I already winked.

1071
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:31,098
I winked without realizing.

1072
00:38:31,098 --> 00:38:32,699
Why do you wink?

1073
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:34,268
- It brings good luck. - It does?

1074
00:38:34,268 --> 00:38:35,998
We'll catch big fish today.

1075
00:38:35,998 --> 00:38:37,098
Really?

1076
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:39,139
- We'll catch huge ones. - I winked too.

1077
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:40,708
- Did you wink? - I did.

1078
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,308
I have a good feeling.

1079
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:45,239
(Team Fishing is feeling positive.)

1080
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,308
- It's so blue. Look at the sea. - Look at that.

1081
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:51,449
It's the ocean. The sea!

1082
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:54,848
- Look at that. - Look at that.

1083
00:38:54,848 --> 00:38:56,918
- This place is great. - It's nice here.

1084
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:59,089
- I didn't think it'd be this nice. - It's so nice.

1085
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:02,188
- So Min, it's nice, right? - Yes, it is.

1086
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:04,659
- I'll teach you how to fish. - It's so nice.

1087
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,458
Hold on, captain!

1088
00:39:06,598 --> 00:39:08,199
- Hello. - Where are you?

1089
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:10,538
- I'm here. - Hello.

1090
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:12,299
- It looks so luxurious. - Hello.

1091
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:13,808
Nice to meet you.

1092
00:39:13,808 --> 00:39:15,368
Thank you for welcoming us on a holiday.

1093
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:17,708
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1094
00:39:17,708 --> 00:39:19,639
- How much do we have to pay? - How much do we have to pay?

1095
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:23,179
It's my own boat.

1096
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,549
So...

1097
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,819
just pay me about 200 dollars for the fuel.

1098
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:29,589
Thank you.

1099
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:30,859
It's too cheap.

1100
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:32,219
It's a holiday today.

1101
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:34,458
- Be quiet. - We'll pay 300 dollars.

1102
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:36,659
(That's not necessary.)

1103
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:39,159
- Think about it. - Let's do that.

1104
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,929
We can pay with the company card.

1105
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:45,969
(Right, we can pay with the company card.)

1106
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,339
Let us pay just 200 dollars.

1107
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:51,078
200 dollars? That's just for the fuel.

1108
00:39:51,078 --> 00:39:52,509
We should pay him for his time too.

1109
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:54,009
He's working on a holiday.

1110
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:55,679
- Let's pay 300 dollars. - We should pay 300 dollars.

1111
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:57,679
- We'll pay 300 dollars. - Sure.

1112
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,118
Thank you.

1113
00:39:59,118 --> 00:40:00,489
He asked us for 200 dollars.

1114
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,819
- He needs some profits. - He's right.

1115
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,018
Don't write any names.

1116
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,489
Of course. We'll pay with the company card.

1117
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:07,659
Let's pay with the company card.

1118
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,389
- Don't write any names. - We should pay him a bit more.

1119
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,058
Let's do it that way.

1120
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:12,299
It's nice. There's some shade too.

1121
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:13,529
- It's nice. - Jae Seok.

1122
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:16,768
- Show us. - Stop rolling your eyes, So Min.

1123
00:40:17,438 --> 00:40:18,438
(Will they spin the roulette?)

1124
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:19,498
It's nice.

1125
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:21,969
It's not so hard to catch webfoot octopuses.

1126
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,509
I've caught some before.

1127
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:25,478
I tried it five years ago.

1128
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,379
- Webfoot octopuses? - You could catch one right away.

1129
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:29,248
- I almost felt bad. - Hey.

1130
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:31,118
If you're after webfoot octopuses, get on another boat.

1131
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:34,949
This boat is for catching tuna.

1132
00:40:35,148 --> 00:40:36,759
- How is this a tuna boat? - What are you saying?

1133
00:40:36,918 --> 00:40:38,688
- It's for webfoot octopuses. - Look at my arms.

1134
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,958
They're too nice for webfoot octopuses.

1135
00:40:41,228 --> 00:40:43,898
If you want tuna, Jong Kook can catch them with his fists.

1136
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:47,368
(If you want tuna, Jong Kook can catch them with his fists.)

1137
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:49,799
By the way,

1138
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:51,069
I'll put this here.

1139
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:52,938
(The box gets on board too.)

1140
00:40:52,938 --> 00:40:55,208
- We don't need it. - We don't need it.

1141
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:57,879
(You didn't hear? We don't need it.)

1142
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,839
- We're not going to use it. - Put it away.

1143
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:01,779
We decided to be nice.

1144
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:03,049
Let's stay this way to the end.

1145
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:05,578
If you write someone's name now,

1146
00:41:06,219 --> 00:41:07,918
you're a jerk.

1147
00:41:08,118 --> 00:41:10,058
- Of course. - Let me tell you.

1148
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:12,558
- After what you said... - Of course.

1149
00:41:12,558 --> 00:41:14,288
I won't forgive you.

1150
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:16,898
- I don't think he will. - Seriously.

1151
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:19,859
I already start to feel sick.

1152
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:21,699
- No way. - Are you nervous?

1153
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:23,469
(The boat departs.)

1154
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,998
Look at the sea!

1155
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:27,938
(They have been exhausted from all the missions and penalties.)

1156
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:31,109
(The beautiful waves are relieving all their stress.)

1157
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,879
(This is therapeutic.)

1158
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,719
The sun on the waves looks beautiful.

1159
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:44,359
It looks so beautiful.

1160
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:47,259
Saving it in my heart.

1161
00:41:47,259 --> 00:41:48,429
I'll do Se Ho's version.

1162
00:41:49,228 --> 00:41:52,098
(Saving it in my eyes)

1163
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:55,328
(Se Ho's version shocked everyone.)

1164
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:57,199
What's with him?

1165
00:41:57,768 --> 00:42:00,208
Saving it in my eyes.

1166
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,308
(Saving the view in my eyes)

1167
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:04,239
(You guys look so happy.)

1168
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,808
Stop it.

1169
00:42:07,578 --> 00:42:08,748
What is Jong Kook doing?

1170
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,648
I'm getting all wet.

1171
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:11,779
Me too.

1172
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:13,918
- Look at this. - The water is spraying everywhere.

1173
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,288
Come sit here.

1174
00:42:16,518 --> 00:42:18,219
The waves are so strong.

1175
00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:20,558
(Therapeutic, my foot.)

1176
00:42:20,558 --> 00:42:21,989
It's cold.

1177
00:42:21,989 --> 00:42:23,898
(They're getting sprayed by the waves.)

1178
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:25,359
The waves are so strong.

1179
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,768
(We're getting all wet.)

1180
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:30,538
- It's cold. - I feel like I'm back in Indonesia.

1181
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:31,569
(Memories of the Tiger Moth Tour)

1182
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:36,739
(It looks as if they're being penalized.)

1183
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,279
You're so wet.

1184
00:42:38,578 --> 00:42:40,978
I'm soaked.

1185
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:47,089
Wherever I go, it's never easy.

1186
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:50,589
This is not what I was expecting.

1187
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,759
I didn't expect this.

1188
00:42:52,759 --> 00:42:54,089
(I didn't know it'd be so tough.)

1189
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,958
Help!

1190
00:42:57,429 --> 00:42:58,759
Help!

1191
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:00,929
So Min, stay seated.

1192
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:02,469
- Help! - Goodness.

1193
00:43:02,898 --> 00:43:05,868
The sea is angry.

1194
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:07,069
I can't...

1195
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:09,509
- stay here any longer. - My pants are all wet.

1196
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:11,239
We can't shoot in this situation.

1197
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:13,978
Can we really shoot?

1198
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:16,578
Sir, help!

1199
00:43:16,578 --> 00:43:18,918
Help!

1200
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,248
Sir!

1201
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:21,788
We'll have webfoot octopuses next time.

1202
00:43:21,788 --> 00:43:23,759
(We'll just buy some.)

1203
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,719
We're here.

1204
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,089
We finally made it.

1205
00:43:27,288 --> 00:43:28,659
It's time to fish.

1206
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:31,029
- You've tried this before, right? - Yes.

1207
00:43:31,328 --> 00:43:34,129
- If somethings bites it... - Do we put it into the water?

1208
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:35,868
- Can we start? - Yes.

1209
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:36,938
Can we put it into the water now?

1210
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:38,239
It has to touch the bottom.

1211
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,668
The bait is so nice. I'm sure we'll catch some.

1212
00:43:42,368 --> 00:43:43,909
- We'll catch something. - Good luck.

1213
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:46,978
We'll definitely catch something.

1214
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:48,549
We have to.

1215
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:50,219
Let's do it.

1216
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,279
- Let's catch something. - Who will catch one first?

1217
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:54,518
I want to beat you guys.

1218
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:56,719
She wants to beat us.

1219
00:43:57,058 --> 00:44:00,489
If I can beat Jong Kook, I'll win.

1220
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:02,458
(You wish.)

1221
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,529
Let's try to catch fluke.

1222
00:44:05,998 --> 00:44:07,768
I'm a fluke expert.

1223
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:09,828
That's absurd.

1224
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:12,098
Gosh.

1225
00:44:12,098 --> 00:44:14,609
He denies everything I say.

1226
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,038
(He denies everything I say.)

1227
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:20,009
Just go to a sashimi place and eat some fluke.

1228
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,308
You're fishing at a nice place thanks to me.

1229
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:24,578
Be quite and be grateful.

1230
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:27,049
Just eat some seafood ramyeon later.

1231
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:28,049
(The fishing king says to thank him.)

1232
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:30,018
(I'll see how many you catch.)

1233
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,018
Okay.

1234
00:44:31,118 --> 00:44:33,118
Let me show you.

1235
00:44:33,118 --> 00:44:34,429
(Sea fishing starts.)

1236
00:44:36,058 --> 00:44:39,529
(Did something bite Seok Jin's bait?)

1237
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:42,768
All I'm getting is seaweed.

1238
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,368
(He was fooled by seaweed.)

1239
00:44:45,398 --> 00:44:47,069
They're not interested in the shrimp.

1240
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:55,009
(Time is ticking away.)

1241
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:56,248
Take a bite.

1242
00:44:57,279 --> 00:44:58,578
I said, "Take a bite."

1243
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:02,819
(It's unbelievable quiet,)

1244
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:05,389
(and there isn't a single webfoot octopus in sight.)

1245
00:45:05,389 --> 00:45:06,489
It's so quiet.

1246
00:45:07,259 --> 00:45:09,029
The water is so calm.

1247
00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:13,728
Be confident.

1248
00:45:14,368 --> 00:45:15,699
We'll catch something.

1249
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:17,098
I'm sure we will.

1250
00:45:17,668 --> 00:45:19,699
I'll show you guys.

1251
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:21,239
(Which of the two will break the calm?)

1252
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:23,978
Reel it in.

1253
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:25,609
Reel it in.

1254
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:27,409
Sir!

1255
00:45:27,478 --> 00:45:28,648
Sir!

1256
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:31,118
(So Min calls the captain hurriedly.)

1257
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:38,989
(Nothing has happened to Jae Seok and Jong Kook's baits yet.)

1258
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:43,259
Something ate the bait and left.

1259
00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:47,598
You should have reeled the line in when something nibbled at the bait.

1260
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:49,469
(It ate just the body of the shrimp.)

1261
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:52,398
It just left the head of the shrimp.

1262
00:45:53,368 --> 00:45:55,868
- It must have been a fluke. - It must have been a fluke.

1263
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:58,379
- Really? - You should have caught it.

1264
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:00,279
- What a shame. - I didn't feel anything.

1265
00:46:00,449 --> 00:46:02,248
- It's a shame. - You didn't notice.

1266
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:04,819
- It's very subtle. - So Min...

1267
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,748
is getting hooked on fishing.

1268
00:46:06,748 --> 00:46:08,219
I'm a fishing queen.

1269
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,859
(I'm a fishing queen.)

1270
00:46:10,859 --> 00:46:12,359
I'm a fishing queen.

1271
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:15,029
It's fun.

1272
00:46:15,188 --> 00:46:17,659
- Fishing is fun. - It gets more and more fun.

1273
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:20,828
Jae Seok is being so quiet.

1274
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,799
Just wait and see.

1275
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:25,969
He was so...

1276
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:28,708
He was so confident.

1277
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:32,208
Stop it. That's enough.

1278
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,909
(I will show you soon.)

1279
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,118
- He talked big. - Seriously.

1280
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:40,648
(So Min's fishing rod bends again while the other members quarrel.)

1281
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:43,989
(This is real!)

1282
00:46:44,518 --> 00:46:50,598
(Is the novice fisher, So Min fated to catch fish?)

1283
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:51,759
For goodness' sake.

1284
00:46:52,129 --> 00:46:55,299
It swam away when I felt the bite and reeled in.

1285
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:58,139
(The head of shrimp is gone this time.)

1286
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:00,239
- It ate the head this time. - It ate cleanly.

1287
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:01,969
That's too bad.

1288
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,239
How did it eat the head?

1289
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:06,339
(Don't people usually feel the bite if fish finishes the bait?)

1290
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:08,279
Did it eat the shrimp again?

1291
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:09,409
(Did it eat the shrimp again?)

1292
00:47:10,819 --> 00:47:13,618
This is driving me crazy. When did this happen?

1293
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:15,018
I didn't feel anything.

1294
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:18,058
So Min, you became well-known among the flukes.

1295
00:47:18,058 --> 00:47:19,159
I am like the owner of a restaurant.

1296
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:20,558
You are known as someone who gives food for free.

1297
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:21,728
(It's like a soup kitchen.)

1298
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:24,859
I don't even feel a nibble.

1299
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,598
Why won't fish eat my bait?

1300
00:47:26,598 --> 00:47:27,629
(Their baits are untouched.)

1301
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:29,069
It lures the fish, but...

1302
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:30,998
It's similar to my life.

1303
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:33,368
Even though I can lure men, I can't make any one of them mine.

1304
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:38,978
(Even though I can lure men, I can't make any one of them mine.)

1305
00:47:39,078 --> 00:47:45,078
(Not many men bite the bait even though I gave them so much.)

1306
00:47:45,549 --> 00:47:48,949
(My life is similar to fishing.)

1307
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:54,089
(How is Team Swing Dance doing while So Min looks back on herself?)

1308
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:55,458
(They arrive at the dance academy with the acclaimed instructors.)

1309
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:56,558
They are dancing.

1310
00:47:56,828 --> 00:47:58,759
- Is this the right place? - Yes, it is.

1311
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:01,469
They are the instructors.

1312
00:48:02,268 --> 00:48:04,098
That's swing dance.

1313
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,799
- That's right. - Is that it?

1314
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,938
It looks cool.

1315
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:08,868
- Let's go. - Let's take our shoes off.

1316
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:10,179
It looks difficult.

1317
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:19,248
- Hello. - Hello.

1318
00:48:19,248 --> 00:48:22,389
- It's nice to meet you. - Who spoke to us on the phone?

1319
00:48:22,389 --> 00:48:24,418
- I did. - You did. Hello.

1320
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:27,489
- What brings you here? - We are here...

1321
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:30,299
- to learn swing dance. - Swing dance.

1322
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:31,898
What you did just now is swing dance, right?

1323
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:33,668
Yes, I'm dancing it right now.

1324
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:34,929
You need two people for it.

1325
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:37,469
Have you heard of Nevis Swing?

1326
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:38,569
Stop it.

1327
00:48:38,868 --> 00:48:41,208
We only have an experience with Nevis Swing.

1328
00:48:41,409 --> 00:48:43,279
That's why we are here.

1329
00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:44,609
We came here to get over Nevis Swing.

1330
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:46,239
(They enter the world of swing dance.)

1331
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:49,609
(The instructors give a swing dance performance.)

1332
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:59,819
(Their facial expressions and steps make the onlookers dance.)

1333
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:02,288
(They have the perfect teamwork.)

1334
00:49:02,529 --> 00:49:04,529
(They are so cool.)

1335
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,398
There she goes.

1336
00:49:09,398 --> 00:49:11,868
(They are surprised by the endless difficult dance moves.)

1337
00:49:12,598 --> 00:49:16,339
(The passionate swing dance is bound to burn Running Man's vacation.)

1338
00:49:19,578 --> 00:49:20,648
Please stop.

1339
00:49:20,648 --> 00:49:24,018
(Is this what swing dance is like?)

1340
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:26,049
- Please stop. - Is that how it normally goes?

1341
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:28,118
- This is the easy version. - This is the easy one?

1342
00:49:28,118 --> 00:49:30,458
- Yes, it is. - We don't know anything about it.

1343
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:31,859
I will do the man's part.

1344
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:34,058
- I will do the man's part. - Me too.

1345
00:49:34,058 --> 00:49:35,228
(They show off their manliness.)

1346
00:49:36,129 --> 00:49:38,859
Everything that is related to swing is scary.

1347
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:41,668
We need to partner up.

1348
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:45,139
Since there are three men, someone must do the woman's part.

1349
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:47,909
Please pick one of us.

1350
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,639
- Should he do the woman's part? - Me?

1351
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:51,078
(As soon as they finish asking,)

1352
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:52,179
(she chooses Kwang Soo.)

1353
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,179
- Should I do the woman's part? - Your face is the prettiest.

1354
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:55,409
Really?

1355
00:49:55,748 --> 00:50:00,989
(If I do the woman's part, I must do this...)

1356
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:03,819
(and that, right?)

1357
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,629
(Why is it me?)

1358
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,989
He has long hair.

1359
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:12,529
His hair is as long as mine. He can wear a hair piece.

1360
00:50:12,898 --> 00:50:14,429
There is a hair piece.

1361
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:15,498
(Now, he is Kwang Ja, not Kwang Soo.)

1362
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,498
(The instructors finally reveal the dance routine they will learn.)

1363
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:21,909
(Relaxed)

1364
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,978
(Clumsy)

1365
00:50:25,339 --> 00:50:26,339
(Claps)

1366
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:31,848
(The cheerful swing steps add to the swing rhythm.)

1367
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:34,549
How do they do that?

1368
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:39,819
(Even though it looks easy, they can only follow clumsily.)

1369
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:44,529
(Lifting)

1370
00:50:44,699 --> 00:50:48,998
(They pull off difficult dance moves with a smile on.)

1371
00:50:51,438 --> 00:50:54,069
(Welcome to the world of swing dance.)

1372
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:55,538
Bravo!

1373
00:50:55,668 --> 00:50:56,909
- It was cool. - Bravo!

1374
00:50:56,909 --> 00:50:58,038
Respect, respect.

1375
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:00,248
(Swing dance deserves big respect.)

1376
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:02,049
This isn't the dance routine we will learn, right?

1377
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,879
- It is. - It is.

1378
00:51:04,018 --> 00:51:06,049
Would you please take out a few dance moves?

1379
00:51:06,248 --> 00:51:09,489
We don't know if we will be able to learn it.

1380
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:11,918
- The basic steps will be enough. - That's right.

1381
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:15,029
Your talent, skills, and facial expressions...

1382
00:51:15,389 --> 00:51:19,029
- will take care of everything. - Our bodies won't follow.

1383
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:22,129
We need to learn the basic rules of swing dance.

1384
00:51:22,129 --> 00:51:24,268
We heard the lesson is 70 dollars per hour.

1385
00:51:24,299 --> 00:51:26,739
We should reach an agreement on the price.

1386
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:29,268
We need to bargain.

1387
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:31,679
- Let's bargain for the price. - 75 dollars per hour.

1388
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,808
It's 75 dollars per hour for each person.

1389
00:51:33,808 --> 00:51:34,949
- 75 dollars. - Yes.

1390
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:37,118
How about we agree on 300 dollars for everyone?

1391
00:51:37,418 --> 00:51:38,618
It's for an hour.

1392
00:51:38,918 --> 00:51:43,288
We dress casually for the lesson...

1393
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:45,259
because it's a popular dance in the US.

1394
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:47,058
Kwang Soo, I will do it for you.

1395
00:51:47,288 --> 00:51:49,828
It looks funny if it's at the front. Let's put it on the side.

1396
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:51,998
Kwang Soo, it looks good on you.

1397
00:51:51,998 --> 00:51:54,228
- How pretty! - You look like a gypsy woman.

1398
00:51:54,398 --> 00:51:55,728
Look.

1399
00:51:55,728 --> 00:51:57,139
Doesn't he look beautiful?

1400
00:51:57,569 --> 00:51:59,799
You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1401
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:01,668
(Surprised)

1402
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,179
- Why would you bring up Sol Bi? - You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1403
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:05,978
You remind me a bit of Sol Bi.

1404
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:07,379
Kwang Soo, it looks good on you.

1405
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:10,179
(Se Chan is wearing an item for men.)

1406
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:11,379
(Laughing)

1407
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,049
I feel like we are in "Rustic Period".

1408
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:17,058
We are like the thugs in "Rustic Period".

1409
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:18,589
- The two of you... - We are like the thugs.

1410
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:20,629
- Breaking news! - That's right.

1411
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:21,889
- Breaking news! - That's how it goes.

1412
00:52:22,188 --> 00:52:23,398
What does that make you?

1413
00:52:23,398 --> 00:52:24,429
(What does that make you?)

1414
00:52:24,429 --> 00:52:25,759
(A wild woman)

1415
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:27,268
- Sol Bi. - Sol Bi.

1416
00:52:27,328 --> 00:52:28,368
- Stop it. - Seriously.

1417
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:29,728
He isn't Sol Bi.

1418
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:31,868
Isn't he a shaman?

1419
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:36,208
Why don't you wear a wrap instead of a skirt?

1420
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,609
- It's nice. - It's nice.

1421
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,109
Would you please make your voice more feminine?

1422
00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:42,248
- We need to concentrate. - Kwang Ja.

1423
00:52:42,379 --> 00:52:44,719
We won't be able to learn anything.

1424
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:46,248
(They divide into groups and begin training.)

1425
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:50,359
(He teaches the steps one by one.)

1426
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,558
(He gives them a lesson according to their capabilities.)

1427
00:52:55,129 --> 00:52:56,328
Backwards.

1428
00:52:56,328 --> 00:52:58,659
(Haha and Se Chan are doing pretty well.)

1429
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:00,429
Good. Good job.

1430
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:01,469
(You are doing a good job.)

1431
00:53:02,129 --> 00:53:05,098
Please go slowly.

1432
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:06,299
Let's go.

1433
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,708
(They keep missing the steps.)

1434
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,009
That was incredible.

1435
00:53:12,009 --> 00:53:13,578
(She is in a daze.)

1436
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:17,118
(These two are struggling with the basic steps.)

1437
00:53:17,118 --> 00:53:20,118
(They always show the same dance moves.)

1438
00:53:20,118 --> 00:53:24,618
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo have a dance they used for the past 7 years.)

1439
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:26,418
Let's try this by ourselves.

1440
00:53:26,518 --> 00:53:28,188
- In 1, 2, 3, 4. - In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1441
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:33,199
Wrong steps.

1442
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:34,898
We forgot everything without her.

1443
00:53:34,898 --> 00:53:36,129
- I will move to the front. - Please show us again.

1444
00:53:36,299 --> 00:53:37,739
In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1445
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:39,239
(The women need a lot of instructions.)

1446
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:40,509
Good job.

1447
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,639
(They are improving slowly.)

1448
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:44,839
(I am starting to get it.)

1449
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:46,679
(They train with passion.)

1450
00:53:46,679 --> 00:53:47,748
Stretch out your legs.

1451
00:53:47,978 --> 00:53:49,148
I'm exhausted.

1452
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,779
You are exhausted, right? Let's take a short break.

1453
00:53:53,719 --> 00:53:56,389
No, I don't want to stop.

1454
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,458
Go.

1455
00:53:58,018 --> 00:53:59,259
Please show me one more time.

1456
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:01,328
- Kwang Soo, are you okay? - I'm okay.

1457
00:54:01,328 --> 00:54:02,788
Please don't stop me.

1458
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:06,359
(No one can stop me.)

1459
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:07,429
(She's praising him.)

1460
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:10,069
(She praises Kwang Soo to stop him,)

1461
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:12,839
(but his steps only get faster.)

1462
00:54:13,368 --> 00:54:14,868
- Is it good? - Yes, it's good.

1463
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:16,139
Please teach us the next move.

1464
00:54:16,139 --> 00:54:17,639
- Shall we move on? - Yes.

1465
00:54:17,909 --> 00:54:21,179
Let's have one couple stand here, and the other one stand here.

1466
00:54:21,909 --> 00:54:23,049
- Now. - Stand here.

1467
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:24,819
- Please take good care of me. - Please take good care of me.

1468
00:54:25,018 --> 00:54:27,018
A man and a woman, the leader and follower...

1469
00:54:27,018 --> 00:54:28,319
face each other.

1470
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,889
Then cross while facing each other.

1471
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:32,288
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1472
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:34,889
(They have a good teamwork.)

1473
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:36,929
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

1474
00:54:36,929 --> 00:54:38,199
Return to your place.

1475
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,558
Which foot goes first?

1476
00:54:39,558 --> 00:54:40,699
I'm sorry,

1477
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:42,629
but my partner looks angry.

1478
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:44,139
I'm not angry, but focused.

1479
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:45,839
- He won't even look at me. - I'm focusing hard.

1480
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:47,168
I'm very focused.

1481
00:54:47,308 --> 00:54:48,708
- I'm taking this seriously. - Since this is a partner dance,

1482
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:50,978
you need to depend on and trust each other.

1483
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,109
-You also need to have love... - Friendship.

1484
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:54,308
- for one another. - You need an eye contact.

1485
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:56,179
- An eye contact. - Let's go, Ji Hyo.

1486
00:54:56,179 --> 00:54:58,449
- I love you, Se Chan. - I love you, Ji Hyo.

1487
00:54:58,449 --> 00:54:59,848
- That's what it means to dance. - Let's love each other.

1488
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,418
Love and cherish each other.

1489
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:05,188
The facial expression is important.

1490
00:55:05,188 --> 00:55:06,259
(I love you.)

1491
00:55:06,259 --> 00:55:07,328
That's great.

1492
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:09,659
(They are full of love.)

1493
00:55:09,788 --> 00:55:11,429
All right. Let's move on.

1494
00:55:11,728 --> 00:55:12,998
Let's try what we learned earlier.

1495
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:15,469
I can't stop myself.

1496
00:55:15,598 --> 00:55:16,969
You look like you are in a good mood.

1497
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:19,098
It's the feeling of swing dance.

1498
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:21,038
- Good. - This part is for women.

1499
00:55:21,038 --> 00:55:24,478
The move where you turn your hips is called swivel.

1500
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:27,848
We will walk forward as we swivel.

1501
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:33,078
(Swivel adds beauty to the swing rhythm.)

1502
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:34,889
It's something you are good at.

1503
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:35,989
Do this quickly.

1504
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:38,958
Do this quickly.

1505
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:43,259
2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Women will go around men.

1506
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:46,359
- What are you doing? - Did you lose your mind?

1507
00:55:46,668 --> 00:55:48,168
- Did you lose your mind? - Did I do it wrong?

1508
00:55:48,168 --> 00:55:49,828
- You look scary. - This is swing dance.

1509
00:55:49,828 --> 00:55:51,239
You are doing well.

1510
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,739
- It was nice. - Kwang Soo is very scary.

1511
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,639
Women need to turn fast in the count of eight.

1512
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:56,879
- Fast? - Yes.

1513
00:55:56,879 --> 00:55:58,679
- Circle the man. - I need quick steps.

1514
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:00,748
We used to go like this. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1515
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,748
(They must move faster.)

1516
00:56:02,748 --> 00:56:04,049
6, 7, 8. That's right.

1517
00:56:04,049 --> 00:56:05,779
You are doing well.

1518
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,089
That's good.

1519
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:09,148
- Go faster. - That's good.

1520
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:13,228
(I'm faster and more unique compared to the others.)

1521
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:15,728
You are very fast.

1522
00:56:15,728 --> 00:56:17,598
May we remove the flower?

1523
00:56:17,859 --> 00:56:20,069
- He looks like a crazy person. - He is crazy for dance.

1524
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:21,969
That flower makes him look like a crazy person.

1525
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,339
You are doing well even though it's a bit scary.

1526
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,538
- Let's try again. - Stand behind him.

1527
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:27,308
(Short and Tall Couple continues to smile.)

1528
00:56:27,469 --> 00:56:29,739
- 5, 6, 7, 8. - Start to move forward.

1529
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:31,679
Next.

1530
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,578
- This is great. - The next movement is...

1531
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,978
- It's Haha's favorite. - I did it a long time ago.

1532
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:41,549
- It's too difficult for now. - Just do it.

1533
00:56:42,618 --> 00:56:43,859
(Do you mean this?)

1534
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,889
He can do it.

1535
00:56:44,889 --> 00:56:45,889
(Do you mean this?)

1536
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:48,429
Kwang Soo, it's for men.

1537
00:56:48,429 --> 00:56:50,529
It's the male dancer's part. It's not for women.

1538
00:56:50,629 --> 00:56:51,958
It's for male dancers.

1539
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,629
Yours is moving the pelvis.

1540
00:56:53,629 --> 00:56:55,368
- Can I do it too? - No.

1541
00:56:55,668 --> 00:56:57,339
- It's almost the last part. - It's the highlight.

1542
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:01,509
The male dancer lifts the female.

1543
00:57:01,509 --> 00:57:05,078
This is how you do it. The female dancer must jump.

1544
00:57:05,078 --> 00:57:08,049
- You must jump. - As she jumps,

1545
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:11,078
go down and up like this.

1546
00:57:11,078 --> 00:57:12,418
(The man's strength and the woman's jumping are the key.)

1547
00:57:12,418 --> 00:57:15,219
- The man supports. In 5, 6, 7, 8. - In 5, 6, 7, 8.

1548
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,819
- Step, down, up, down. - That's right.

1549
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:19,018
- You did well. - Good job.

1550
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,129
- We can do it. - Was it okay?

1551
00:57:20,129 --> 00:57:21,429
I'm too heavy.

1552
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:23,089
- You're light. - You aren't heavy at all.

1553
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:26,098
- You're very light. - May we try it?

1554
00:57:26,098 --> 00:57:27,228
(Can you take a look at us?)

1555
00:57:27,228 --> 00:57:28,368
We're confident.

1556
00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:29,398
- Okay. - I practiced a lot too.

1557
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:31,368
- Go ahead. - We'll give it a try.

1558
00:57:31,938 --> 00:57:35,009
1, 2, 3, 4. Back, step, down.

1559
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,208
That was great.

1560
00:57:37,208 --> 00:57:39,478
- How was it good? - It wasn't.

1561
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:41,978
You didn't see Kwang Soo's face.

1562
00:57:41,978 --> 00:57:43,779
- His face was strange. - Really?

1563
00:57:43,779 --> 00:57:44,848
Fix his facial expression.

1564
00:57:44,848 --> 00:57:46,518
Let me take a look at the facial expression.

1565
00:57:46,518 --> 00:57:47,848
- Facial expression? Okay. - Yes.

1566
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:52,188
- Get ready. - 1, 2, 3, 4. Back, step, down.

1567
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:56,259
(It's the wrong smile of a swing dancer.)

1568
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:58,859
Good job. You're doing very well.

1569
00:57:59,098 --> 00:58:02,199
I bet they can try this move.

1570
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,598
Please follow our move.

1571
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:08,609
5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1572
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:09,909
(He adds a kick.)

1573
00:58:09,909 --> 00:58:11,808
- That's so easy. - 5, 6, 7.

1574
00:58:11,808 --> 00:58:14,679
(Do you mean a kick between my legs?)

1575
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:16,848
- Watch us carefully. - Let's go.

1576
00:58:16,879 --> 00:58:18,418
Try it, Kwang Soo.

1577
00:58:18,418 --> 00:58:19,719
- Watch carefully. - All right.

1578
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:22,049
- Haha, give him the count. - You can do it.

1579
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:23,719
- Get ready, set. - Wait.

1580
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:25,958
- I'm not a real woman. - Start with the count.

1581
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:29,188
1, 2, 3, 4, back, step, down.

1582
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,139
(How could you?)

1583
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:38,938
You must hold him up.

1584
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:40,409
I did.

1585
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:42,009
- Haha. - He let me go.

1586
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:44,808
After you put down your partner,

1587
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:49,078
you'll choreograph the next part.

1588
00:58:49,078 --> 00:58:52,478
For example, you may finish in this pose.

1589
00:58:52,478 --> 00:58:54,049
- You can finish like this. - Or...

1590
00:58:54,248 --> 00:58:55,248
do this.

1591
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:58,219
(Swinging)

1592
00:58:58,219 --> 00:59:00,328
- You may finish in this pose. - Can you do that?

1593
00:59:01,029 --> 00:59:02,389
Let's try that.

1594
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:04,828
- Show us how you did the last part. - Be creative.

1595
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:08,129
Put your leg around the partner's waist.

1596
00:59:08,398 --> 00:59:10,339
- Lift her up. - Here's how you move.

1597
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:11,398
Turn her around.

1598
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:14,139
Separate the legs while you jump.

1599
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:15,168
Three.

1600
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,978
It doesn't work.

1601
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:19,009
(Come on!)

1602
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:20,549
Haha wanted to kick him.

1603
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:21,949
How dare you?

1604
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:25,319
(They're not fighting. They're creating the last part.)

1605
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:27,319
Practice on your own.

1606
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:31,418
Let's practice one last time while watching the teacher.

1607
00:59:31,518 --> 00:59:32,518
Okay.

1608
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:35,759
Cross and turn. Watch the arms.

1609
00:59:35,828 --> 00:59:39,199
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1610
00:59:39,498 --> 00:59:43,199
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo dance well together.)

1611
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:45,239
One more time.

1612
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:48,969
(They're very focused that they're not speaking.)

1613
00:59:48,969 --> 00:59:51,139
Gosh, what are we doing?

1614
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:53,509
Please let me go eat ramyeon.

1615
00:59:53,578 --> 00:59:54,708
Try harder.

1616
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,808
What is this?

1617
00:59:55,808 --> 00:59:57,018
(What's this on my head?)

1618
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,418
What are we doing?

1619
00:59:59,848 --> 01:00:01,989
(What do you mean? It's swing dance.)

1620
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:07,029
(Their surprising swing dance performance is coming up soon.)

1621
01:00:07,989 --> 01:00:10,328
- We don't have much time. - We must hurry.

1622
01:00:10,328 --> 01:00:12,129
We can't stay here long.

1623
01:00:12,629 --> 01:00:15,898
Fishing is not about catching fish. It's about catching time.

1624
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:19,398
(They haven't caught any fish for 1 hour.)

1625
01:00:19,398 --> 01:00:21,339
I didn't catch anything.

1626
01:00:21,339 --> 01:00:22,938
(They haven't caught any fish for 1 hour.)

1627
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:27,009
Bite, bite.

1628
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:30,319
(They even get aggressive.)

1629
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:32,518
Can anyone catch just one fish?

1630
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:34,648
Let's try to catch at least one.

1631
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:37,759
What happened? Come on, Jae Seok.

1632
01:00:38,118 --> 01:00:39,929
There aren't any fish, So Min.

1633
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:40,989
(He has no idea what's going on.)

1634
01:00:43,228 --> 01:00:44,458
(Jong Kook's fishing rod moves.)

1635
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,868
Didn't something get caught? Take a look.

1636
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:47,868
(It's tight.)

1637
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:48,929
- He caught something. - He did.

1638
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:51,768
(Did Jong Kook catch something after an hour?)

1639
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:53,199
What's going on?

1640
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:55,009
(Will Jong Kook catch first?)

1641
01:00:55,639 --> 01:01:01,348
(Will Jong Kook fill the containers with fish?)

1642
01:01:01,348 --> 01:01:04,449
I caught it. I caught a webfoot octopus.

1643
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:05,949
- Hurry up. - It's a webfoot octopus.

1644
01:01:05,949 --> 01:01:07,049
(Did he catch a webfoot octopus?)

1645
01:01:07,049 --> 01:01:08,089
He caught a webfoot octopus.

1646
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:14,929
(Jong Kook catches a large webfoot octopus.)

1647
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:15,929
It's a webfoot octopus.

1648
01:01:15,929 --> 01:01:18,359
(After 1 hour, they finally catch something.)

1649
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:20,529
- He caught one. - I caught a webfoot octopus.

1650
01:01:20,629 --> 01:01:22,398
- Gosh. - May I touch the head?

1651
01:01:22,398 --> 01:01:23,398
Yes, take it off.

1652
01:01:24,038 --> 01:01:25,038
- Take it off. - Goodness.

1653
01:01:25,038 --> 01:01:26,938
Gosh, it's interesting.

1654
01:01:27,509 --> 01:01:29,069
You can eat it raw.

1655
01:01:29,139 --> 01:01:32,279
The webfoot octopus bit the bait. It's so cute.

1656
01:01:32,308 --> 01:01:34,279
I should have caught it.

1657
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:36,078
You don't know anything about fishing.

1658
01:01:36,078 --> 01:01:39,118
Gosh, this is so frustrating. It's so annoying.

1659
01:01:40,248 --> 01:01:42,688
I bet the webfoot octopus that he caught is all we're catching today.

1660
01:01:43,418 --> 01:01:44,458
That's how I feel.

1661
01:01:47,489 --> 01:01:48,558
- It's a webfoot octopus. - I caught one.

1662
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,699
I caught a webfoot octopus.

1663
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,159
(They catch the second one.)

1664
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:54,969
- It's big. - Goodness.

1665
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:56,429
I almost lost it.

1666
01:01:56,938 --> 01:01:58,569
He caught another one.

1667
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:01,109
- It's really big. - It's so big.

1668
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,109
(This is what fishing is like.)

1669
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:10,518
Fish recognize the bait of a professional fisherman.

1670
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:13,078
- Goodness. - He insisted on fishing...

1671
01:02:13,078 --> 01:02:14,918
even though he's not good at it.

1672
01:02:16,248 --> 01:02:18,489
Is something wrong with my bait? Why can't I catch any?

1673
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:22,188
I'm in a lonely fight.

1674
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:26,029
I'm fighting against the sea, fishing, and the fish.

1675
01:02:26,029 --> 01:02:27,328
(It's a saying of the king of fishing.)

1676
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:30,998
No fish falls for my bait.

1677
01:02:30,998 --> 01:02:32,598
(Jae Seok hasn't caught any.)

1678
01:02:32,598 --> 01:02:33,739
I felt something.

1679
01:02:33,938 --> 01:02:36,038
Is something wrong with my bait? Why can't I catch any?

1680
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:37,708
(He's at risk of losing his title.)

1681
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:42,509
(Will he recover his damaged reputation?)

1682
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:46,319
Did you feel something?

1683
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:48,688
(Something bites the bait.)

1684
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:50,089
He got something.

1685
01:02:50,089 --> 01:02:53,989
(Those who looked down on me, just watch what I got.)

1686
01:02:53,989 --> 01:03:00,029
(He calls himself the king of fishing. Will he prove himself?)

1687
01:03:00,029 --> 01:03:01,268
The fishing rod got bent.

1688
01:03:01,268 --> 01:03:02,826
(He calls himself the king of fishing. Will he prove himself?)

1689
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:07,376
(He catches a tiny webfoot octopus.)

1690
01:03:07,376 --> 01:03:10,686
- Come on. - Okay.

1691
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:13,586
- This is great. - It's a small webfoot octopus.

1692
01:03:13,586 --> 01:03:15,615
Okay, this is great.

1693
01:03:16,255 --> 01:03:17,385
Okay, nice.

1694
01:03:17,385 --> 01:03:18,755
(It's a small webfoot octopus.)

1695
01:03:18,885 --> 01:03:21,296
- Finally, - I'm going to catch one myself.

1696
01:03:21,296 --> 01:03:25,095
they're reacting to my professional fishing bait.

1697
01:03:25,365 --> 01:03:27,595
You caught such a small one.

1698
01:03:27,965 --> 01:03:29,735
Be quiet, So Min.

1699
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:32,266
I'm on the fishing channel.

1700
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:34,976
Did you catch it on camera?

1701
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:36,005
(Yu Jae Seok, the webfoot octopus expert)

1702
01:03:36,005 --> 01:03:39,345
You missed such an important moment.

1703
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:42,276
The smallest octopus in the container is Jae Seok's.

1704
01:03:43,146 --> 01:03:44,746
- It's the smallest. - It's a baby.

1705
01:03:46,046 --> 01:03:48,715
His sweet potatoes and webfoot octopus are small.

1706
01:03:48,715 --> 01:03:50,726
(Everything he gets is small.)

1707
01:03:52,226 --> 01:03:57,195
(Is Jae Seok's expertise in small things?)

1708
01:03:58,325 --> 01:04:00,226
He's Small Jae Seok.

1709
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:01,296
(He gets a new nickname, "Small Jae Seok".)

1710
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,365
My goodness.

1711
01:04:02,365 --> 01:04:03,936
(He gets a new nickname, "Small Jae Seok").

1712
01:04:05,365 --> 01:04:07,876
It'd be great if I catch one fluke.

1713
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:08,876
(No one catches any fluke.)

1714
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:11,706
What if the fish want us to stop fishing?

1715
01:04:12,046 --> 01:04:13,146
Stop fishing.

1716
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:14,945
It's time for us to leave.

1717
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:16,845
(They caught one webfoot octopus each.)

1718
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:20,885
Wait a minute. I think I caught something.

1719
01:04:20,885 --> 01:04:24,086
(Wait a minute. I think I caught something.)

1720
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:26,586
- It's fluke. - I caught something.

1721
01:04:27,026 --> 01:04:28,496
- He caught it. - What is it?

1722
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:33,695
(He feels a different type of bite.)

1723
01:04:33,695 --> 01:04:34,796
I caught it.

1724
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,936
- It's fluke. - What is it? It's not fluke.

1725
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:38,936
What is it?

1726
01:04:40,035 --> 01:04:41,075
What is it?

1727
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,735
(What type of fish is it?)

1728
01:04:42,735 --> 01:04:43,776
What is it?

1729
01:04:43,905 --> 01:04:45,746
- What is it? - It's flathead.

1730
01:04:45,746 --> 01:04:48,945
(Jong Kook catches huge flathead.)

1731
01:04:48,945 --> 01:04:49,976
It's flathead.

1732
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:52,016
He caught something.

1733
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:53,516
(He caught a great one.)

1734
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:54,816
That's amazing.

1735
01:04:54,816 --> 01:04:56,785
- Jong Kook is amazing. - Jong Kook caught it.

1736
01:04:56,985 --> 01:04:59,226
How did you catch it?

1737
01:04:59,856 --> 01:05:02,026
I had a feeling that I got lucky.

1738
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,496
Can we eat this fish, sir?

1739
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:08,666
You can eat it raw, but it's perfect for stew.

1740
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:10,195
Maybe not for ramyeon.

1741
01:05:10,805 --> 01:05:12,706
I just felt it.

1742
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:15,235
- Its mouth... - Congratulations.

1743
01:05:15,235 --> 01:05:16,836
Why can't I catch anything like that?

1744
01:05:16,836 --> 01:05:19,376
(Jong Kook proved his class.)

1745
01:05:20,106 --> 01:05:22,246
We have enough webfoot octopuses to make ramyeon.

1746
01:05:22,246 --> 01:05:24,715
Something ate the shrimp and left.

1747
01:05:25,485 --> 01:05:27,316
This is the first thing I caught.

1748
01:05:27,316 --> 01:05:28,356
(A small webfoot octopus)

1749
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:30,526
- I'm sorry. - Look at that.

1750
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,155
It's interesting.

1751
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:34,655
- Put them in one by one. - Okay.

1752
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:37,365
Yes, like that.

1753
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:39,425
I'm sorry, but...

1754
01:05:39,425 --> 01:05:41,796
- stop saying that at the back. - You're doing a good job.

1755
01:05:42,766 --> 01:05:43,905
Look at that soup.

1756
01:05:44,566 --> 01:05:46,135
They have so much ink.

1757
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,535
It's webfoot octopus ink ramyeon.

1758
01:05:49,305 --> 01:05:50,546
The soup...

1759
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:51,575
(This is the real vacation.)

1760
01:05:51,575 --> 01:05:52,876
This is making me eat a lot.

1761
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:55,575
(Jae Seok puts a webfoot octopus in his mouth.)

1762
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:59,146
- It tastes so good. - It tastes really good.

1763
01:05:59,746 --> 01:06:01,615
- It tastes fantastic. - With webfoot octopuses...

1764
01:06:01,615 --> 01:06:03,925
(Even Jong Kook enjoys ramyeon today.)

1765
01:06:03,925 --> 01:06:05,485
It tastes much better.

1766
01:06:07,356 --> 01:06:10,425
Dear ramyeon advertisers...

1767
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,925
(This is my chance.)

1768
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:15,566
(So Min is good at describing flavors.)

1769
01:06:15,566 --> 01:06:18,336
(She'll make people's mouths water.)

1770
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:21,276
(Dear advertisers, what do you think of me?)

1771
01:06:21,276 --> 01:06:23,135
You look too ambitious. Stop it.

1772
01:06:23,135 --> 01:06:24,575
(They're trying to protect her.)

1773
01:06:24,575 --> 01:06:26,575
(Disappointed)

1774
01:06:27,816 --> 01:06:29,376
You should hum now.

1775
01:06:29,376 --> 01:06:30,416
(The last task is humming.)

1776
01:06:30,416 --> 01:06:32,215
Just me? Shouldn't everyone do it?

1777
01:06:33,816 --> 01:06:35,586
How do you hum?

1778
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:37,825
(Humming)

1779
01:06:37,825 --> 01:06:38,885
Like this.

1780
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:42,356
(I'm happy when you smile)

1781
01:06:42,356 --> 01:06:43,456
Isn't this humming?

1782
01:06:43,456 --> 01:06:45,396
That's just a nasal sound.

1783
01:06:46,226 --> 01:06:48,365
(I thought I was humming.)

1784
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:51,366
- One song comes to my mind. - Which one?

1785
01:06:52,335 --> 01:06:55,776
("Meeting" by Noh Sa Yeon)

1786
01:06:56,276 --> 01:07:00,106
(Seok Jin likes it.)

1787
01:07:00,715 --> 01:07:03,675
(To get over it)

1788
01:07:03,816 --> 01:07:06,686
(It's too...)

1789
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:09,415
Judging from the way she sings,

1790
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:11,286
she must have been born before 1965.

1791
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:13,856
(So Min sounds old.)

1792
01:07:15,255 --> 01:07:19,866
(They all start to sing together.)

1793
01:07:20,396 --> 01:07:21,995
(She hits the high notes.)

1794
01:07:21,995 --> 01:07:23,465
I love you

1795
01:07:23,465 --> 01:07:26,436
(She hits the high notes.)

1796
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:32,276
(They sing together despite the age gap.)

1797
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:37,146
(Relaxing tour, I love you)

1798
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:40,186
- Harmony. - What's with you?

1799
01:07:40,986 --> 01:07:42,955
I want to be good at singing.

1800
01:07:42,955 --> 01:07:44,226
(After accomplishing all tasks, they're back.)

1801
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,486
Good work, everybody.

1802
01:07:45,755 --> 01:07:47,255
Thank you, Captain.

1803
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:50,766
I'm so happy to finally land.

1804
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,495
- It was exhausting. - I felt sick.

1805
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,665
It wasn't easy.

1806
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:57,366
(Jae Seok goes back onto the boat.)

1807
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,705
I'm happy to land.

1808
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:00,406
Give me some paper.

1809
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:04,476
(While everyone is getting off the boat,)

1810
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:07,675
(Jae Seok writes down a name.)

1811
01:08:07,675 --> 01:08:08,715
Here.

1812
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:10,845
What are you doing?

1813
01:08:11,215 --> 01:08:12,686
- What? - What are you doing?

1814
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:14,915
- I'm taking this thing off. - What?

1815
01:08:14,915 --> 01:08:17,226
(Whose name did he write?)

1816
01:08:17,585 --> 01:08:20,826
The total cost of your tour was...

1817
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,696
- 300 dollars. - 300 dollars? Okay.

1818
01:08:22,696 --> 01:08:25,366
(They have to pay 300 dollars.)

1819
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:29,095
If the box is empty, we'll turn the wheel.

1820
01:08:31,536 --> 01:08:33,566
I see my name.

1821
01:08:33,566 --> 01:08:36,036
(Unbelievable)

1822
01:08:37,505 --> 01:08:39,976
- Who did it? - Who did it?

1823
01:08:41,715 --> 01:08:44,016
(Seok Jin is a candidate.)

1824
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:47,156
It's Jae Seok's handwriting.

1825
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,486
I recognize his handwriting.

1826
01:08:48,486 --> 01:08:50,316
It's definitely his.

1827
01:08:50,316 --> 01:08:52,326
I can't believe this. Wait.

1828
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:53,585
(There's something more in the box.)

1829
01:08:53,585 --> 01:08:55,095
Someone wrote a name on a towel.

1830
01:08:55,826 --> 01:08:57,125
A towel?

1831
01:08:57,696 --> 01:08:58,925
Oh, my.

1832
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:00,095
(Jae Seok's name is written on a towel.)

1833
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,436
Do you have a pen?

1834
01:09:02,436 --> 01:09:03,566
(While they were moving to the fishing spot...)

1835
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:07,536
(While Jae Seok was hiding from the waves,)

1836
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:13,345
(Seok Jin wrote his name on a towel.)

1837
01:09:13,976 --> 01:09:16,345
(He didn't see it, did he?)

1838
01:09:17,016 --> 01:09:18,786
- There's something more. - What's that?

1839
01:09:18,786 --> 01:09:20,516
- It's an oil control film. - Is there a name on it?

1840
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:22,686
- There is. - It says, "Kim Jong Kook".

1841
01:09:23,516 --> 01:09:25,085
It's written clearly.

1842
01:09:26,686 --> 01:09:31,196
(While Jong Kook was covering his face...)

1843
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:33,196
She's writing his name when he's covering his face.

1844
01:09:33,196 --> 01:09:34,696
(So Min is taking the chance.)

1845
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:39,665
(So Min wrote Jong Kook's name.)

1846
01:09:39,705 --> 01:09:41,936
I can't believe you.

1847
01:09:41,936 --> 01:09:44,175
The whole time, I was...

1848
01:09:45,045 --> 01:09:46,406
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1849
01:09:46,406 --> 01:09:47,446
There are three balls.

1850
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:48,675
So Min will pick one.

1851
01:09:49,215 --> 01:09:51,585
- So Min will pick one. - Yes.

1852
01:09:51,585 --> 01:09:52,915
Pull it out at once.

1853
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:54,156
Just do it.

1854
01:09:54,516 --> 01:09:56,255
The one who gets chosen...

1855
01:09:56,255 --> 01:09:57,925
- will pay. - Should I pick this one?

1856
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:01,055
I can spend this much for the members.

1857
01:10:02,226 --> 01:10:04,226
Pick Jae Seok.

1858
01:10:04,925 --> 01:10:09,066
Go after Sinsa-dong Mudfish.

1859
01:10:09,135 --> 01:10:11,606
Just pick one at once.

1860
01:10:12,135 --> 01:10:13,536
Who is it?

1861
01:10:13,536 --> 01:10:14,606
(Who did she pick?)

1862
01:10:14,606 --> 01:10:17,375
The total cost of your tour was...

1863
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:18,545
300 dollars.

1864
01:10:18,545 --> 01:10:20,005
(The one who gets chosen has to pay 300 dollars.)

1865
01:10:20,776 --> 01:10:21,816
Who is it?

1866
01:10:21,816 --> 01:10:24,686
(Seok Jin will pay for the fishing.)

1867
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:26,486
Really?

1868
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:28,656
(Annoyed)

1869
01:10:30,486 --> 01:10:33,686
(Thank you for everything, Seok Jin.)

1870
01:10:33,686 --> 01:10:35,625
I'm so happy.

1871
01:10:36,226 --> 01:10:37,465
So Min, that little...

1872
01:10:37,696 --> 01:10:39,696
I should have written her name.

1873
01:10:40,595 --> 01:10:41,835
Something is being printed.

1874
01:10:42,436 --> 01:10:43,665
It's a receipt.

1875
01:10:43,665 --> 01:10:45,465
(Seok Jin pays 300 dollars.)

1876
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:48,135
I recommended this activity for Seok Jin.

1877
01:10:48,135 --> 01:10:50,135
- He should pay. - Thank you for the good time.

1878
01:10:50,135 --> 01:10:51,675
(Team Fishing is finished.)

1879
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:53,875
Let's do this.

1880
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:55,946
- Is it our turn? - Do we go first?

1881
01:10:56,175 --> 01:10:57,845
Be confident and bright.

1882
01:10:57,845 --> 01:10:59,915
I'm getting nervous now.

1883
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:01,856
We're more serious than ever.

1884
01:11:01,915 --> 01:11:03,415
This is not a competition.

1885
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,385
We're here to enjoy ourselves.

1886
01:11:07,226 --> 01:11:09,625
(They learned swing dance for an hour.)

1887
01:11:09,625 --> 01:11:11,526
- Good! - Nice.

1888
01:11:11,526 --> 01:11:14,236
(They learned swing dance for an hour.)

1889
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:19,165
(Will they be able to pull it off?)

1890
01:11:19,805 --> 01:11:21,505
Play the music.

1891
01:11:21,505 --> 01:11:23,705
(The music starts.)

1892
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:28,576
(They're getting into the rhythm.)

1893
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:31,415
(They make an eye contact.)

1894
01:11:34,616 --> 01:11:37,625
(They're pulling off the steps perfectly.)

1895
01:11:39,656 --> 01:11:41,095
(She's back to her confident self.)

1896
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:46,095
(Perfect teamwork)

1897
01:11:49,236 --> 01:11:52,366
(They're perfectly in sync.)

1898
01:11:54,736 --> 01:11:57,406
(They even look relaxed.)

1899
01:11:59,646 --> 01:12:03,415
(Ji Hyo is doing a great job.)

1900
01:12:07,116 --> 01:12:12,186
(They spent only an hour to prepare for this performance.)

1901
01:12:13,085 --> 01:12:14,925
(It's the most difficult part.)

1902
01:12:16,255 --> 01:12:18,396
(They perfectly manage it.)

1903
01:12:19,196 --> 01:12:23,635
(Ji Hyo has changed.)

1904
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,766
They're so calm.

1905
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:28,036
She is doing so well.

1906
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,276
I'm exhausted.

1907
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:30,276
(It's time to jump.)

1908
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:33,005

1909
01:12:34,245 --> 01:12:36,215
(Freestyle dance of each team)

1910
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:40,955
(The name of this dance is "Floundering in the sea of swing".)

1911
01:12:42,055 --> 01:12:43,656
(They finish it off nicely.)

1912
01:12:45,026 --> 01:12:48,295
(Bravo)

1913
01:12:48,295 --> 01:12:49,755
Great job.

1914
01:12:49,755 --> 01:12:52,425
- We did it! - It was perfect.

1915
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:54,795
Nevis Swing.

1916
01:12:54,795 --> 01:12:56,066
Respect, respect.

1917
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:57,165
(Respect)

1918
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,066
Good teamwork.

1919
01:12:59,736 --> 01:13:01,106
As soon as the music started,

1920
01:13:01,106 --> 01:13:03,736
both of you looked like different people.

1921
01:13:03,736 --> 01:13:05,845
They changed at once.

1922
01:13:05,976 --> 01:13:07,616
- They're talented. - Totally.

1923
01:13:07,976 --> 01:13:10,175
I didn't expect such great teamwork.

1924
01:13:10,175 --> 01:13:12,016
- It was amazing. - You did a fantastic job.

1925
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:13,085
Great teamwork.

1926
01:13:13,085 --> 01:13:14,255
It was definitely therapeutic.

1927
01:13:14,415 --> 01:13:15,616
We're taking a day off today.

1928
01:13:15,755 --> 01:13:17,486
All right. Next...

1929
01:13:17,486 --> 01:13:18,856
- You win. - Give it a try.

1930
01:13:18,856 --> 01:13:20,385
- Just try. - I don't remember a thing.

1931
01:13:20,385 --> 01:13:22,055
- They did it at one go. - Next team.

1932
01:13:22,255 --> 01:13:23,595
Let's welcome the next team.

1933
01:13:23,795 --> 01:13:24,965
Haha and...

1934
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:26,125
- Kwang Soo. - Let's go.

1935
01:13:27,095 --> 01:13:28,196
Let's go.

1936
01:13:28,436 --> 01:13:29,766
Haha looks great.

1937
01:13:29,766 --> 01:13:31,005
Take a pose.

1938
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:32,066
(Haha looks like a newsboy.)

1939
01:13:32,936 --> 01:13:33,936
Are you ready?

1940
01:13:33,936 --> 01:13:34,936
Let's get it.

1941
01:13:34,936 --> 01:13:36,875
(Let's get it.)

1942
01:13:38,646 --> 01:13:40,245
(Warming up)

1943
01:13:41,516 --> 01:13:44,016
(They look too excited.)

1944
01:13:44,016 --> 01:13:45,286
Are we paying with a company card?

1945
01:13:45,516 --> 01:13:46,786
Let's do that.

1946
01:13:46,986 --> 01:13:48,215
Swing.

1947
01:13:48,915 --> 01:13:50,385
- Swing, swing, swing. - Way to go!

1948
01:13:50,385 --> 01:13:51,726
(Their steps are energetic.)

1949
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:55,856
(Their facial expressions are priceless.)

1950
01:13:57,526 --> 01:14:01,135
(Great teamwork between the tallest and the shortest)

1951
01:14:01,135 --> 01:14:04,305
(They're perfectly in sync.)

1952
01:14:07,675 --> 01:14:09,705
Nice facial expression.

1953
01:14:09,705 --> 01:14:11,276
(They're natural-born swing dancers.)

1954
01:14:14,715 --> 01:14:17,686
(The audience looks somewhat uncomfortable.)

1955
01:14:22,915 --> 01:14:25,755
Nice! Way to go!

1956
01:14:26,885 --> 01:14:27,896
(It's time to jump.)

1957
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,196
Look at him.

1958
01:14:31,495 --> 01:14:33,425
(Success)

1959
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:36,536
(How will they finish it off?)

1960
01:14:41,675 --> 01:14:42,936
(Shorty's freeze)

1961
01:14:44,045 --> 01:14:45,076
(Fantastic collaboration of swing dance and B-boying)

1962
01:14:45,076 --> 01:14:46,305
Respect!

1963
01:14:49,076 --> 01:14:52,516
(Haha and Kwang Soo's performance is finished.)

1964
01:14:54,516 --> 01:14:57,726
I want to cry for some reason.

1965
01:14:57,885 --> 01:14:59,085
Let's give them a big hand.

1966
01:15:00,826 --> 01:15:03,396
(Swing dance class for Haha is over.)

1967
01:15:05,226 --> 01:15:07,965
The amount of money you spent for this activity...

1968
01:15:08,135 --> 01:15:10,906
- is 320 dollars in total. - Okay.

1969
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:11,965
(It was for registering for the class and buying props.)

1970
01:15:11,965 --> 01:15:13,406
Before we calculate the balance,

1971
01:15:13,736 --> 01:15:16,036
let's check the golden bell box.

1972
01:15:16,036 --> 01:15:17,875
We probably won't have anybody.

1973
01:15:17,906 --> 01:15:20,745
- Won't they spin the roulette? - We'll use the company card.

1974
01:15:20,745 --> 01:15:21,915
(If there's nobody, they'll use the company card.)

1975
01:15:22,175 --> 01:15:23,276
Let's use the company card.

1976
01:15:23,276 --> 01:15:25,085
(A few hours ago on their way to the swing dance class)

1977
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:26,415
Let's say swing, swing.

1978
01:15:26,415 --> 01:15:29,486
(This team decides to use the company card.)

1979
01:15:30,215 --> 01:15:32,186
(In a moment)

1980
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:34,396
Is she in a sleeping cafe? I thought we didn't pick that one.

1981
01:15:35,856 --> 01:15:36,955
I know, right?

1982
01:15:36,955 --> 01:15:38,526
(She makes her own sleeping cafe.)

1983
01:15:38,526 --> 01:15:39,726
Isn't this cheating?

1984
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:42,066
She's not allowed to this.

1985
01:15:42,366 --> 01:15:46,436
She's in her own sleeping cafe. This doesn't make sense.

1986
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:47,536
(They want to betray her.)

1987
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:52,776
(They unite without Ji Hyo who's sleeping.)

1988
01:15:53,446 --> 01:15:56,415
(They decide to write Ji Hyo's name.)

1989
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:57,446
Ji Hyo?

1990
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:05,425
(They all vote for Ji Hyo.)

1991
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,656
- There are names inside. - Please pick a name.

1992
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:09,656
- Please call it out for us. - You can open it like this.

1993
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:11,925
- You can pick whichever. - They are all in there.

1994
01:16:11,925 --> 01:16:13,896
- You can read all of them. - All of them.

1995
01:16:13,896 --> 01:16:14,936
(It's from me, Haha, and Se Chan.)

1996
01:16:14,936 --> 01:16:15,965
There are four names.

1997
01:16:19,665 --> 01:16:23,436
(Ji Hyo won't just watch. She betrays them as well.)

1998
01:16:23,436 --> 01:16:25,646
(They unite over their betrayal for each other.)

1999
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:27,415
- Four? - We all put it in? When?

2000
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:29,375
(Who will ring the golden bell?)

2001
01:16:30,316 --> 01:16:31,486
Lee Kwang Soo.

2002
01:16:33,646 --> 01:16:34,786
Lee Kwang Soo.

2003
01:16:34,786 --> 01:16:36,715
(Did Ji Hyo write my name?)

2004
01:16:36,715 --> 01:16:37,885
Lee Kwang Soo.

2005
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:39,085
(It's him again.)

2006
01:16:39,085 --> 01:16:40,356
(He got two votes?)

2007
01:16:40,356 --> 01:16:42,425
Song Ji Hyo. It's all Song Ji Hyo.

2008
01:16:42,925 --> 01:16:44,066
I got two for Song Ji Hyo.

2009
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,295
I got 2 for Lee Kwang Soo. It's 2 on 2.

2010
01:16:46,366 --> 01:16:47,736
- My goodness. - What happened?

2011
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,696
- Who did that? - Somebody bent their promise.

2012
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:51,366
Who did you write?

2013
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:52,505
(Which of you is it?)

2014
01:16:52,505 --> 01:16:53,736
- Who is it? - Hold on.

2015
01:16:53,736 --> 01:16:55,005
- Ji Hyo, I wanted to stop. - Who is it?

2016
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:56,305
That's not the problem right now.

2017
01:16:56,305 --> 01:16:57,845
It's 100 percent certain you wrote my name and I wrote yours.

2018
01:16:58,875 --> 01:16:59,906
This is obvious.

2019
01:17:00,406 --> 01:17:03,076
- I can't write my own name. - Right.

2020
01:17:03,215 --> 01:17:04,585
- That's right. - I'm getting goosebumps.

2021
01:17:04,585 --> 01:17:06,245
- It's either one of us. - Let's clean this up later.

2022
01:17:06,486 --> 01:17:08,085
Please pick one.

2023
01:17:08,085 --> 01:17:10,215
- Just 1? - Yes, you just need to pick 1.

2024
01:17:10,215 --> 01:17:11,856
If it's against Ji Hyo...

2025
01:17:11,856 --> 01:17:14,955
(Is it Kwang Soo or Ji Hyo?)

2026
01:17:14,955 --> 01:17:16,356
Make sure nobody sees it.

2027
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,965
(What's that supposed to mean?)

2028
01:17:19,965 --> 01:17:21,696
I think this person has a connection with me.

2029
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:23,335
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2030
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:26,566
(Who will pay for everything?)

2031
01:17:28,606 --> 01:17:30,205
(It's Kwang Soo.)

2032
01:17:30,205 --> 01:17:31,305
It's Kwang Soo.

2033
01:17:32,906 --> 01:17:35,476
(Kwang Soo has to pay 320 dollars with his personal credit card.)

2034
01:17:35,476 --> 01:17:37,146
Ji Hyo got lucky again.

2035
01:17:39,345 --> 01:17:42,415
- Thanks. This was therapeutic. - I know. Thanks.

2036
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:44,526
- Please turn on some music. - Thanks so much.

2037
01:17:44,555 --> 01:17:46,955
- Isn't this a party? - Let's go party.

2038
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:48,026
Let's go.

2039
01:17:48,156 --> 01:17:50,625
(He dances as soon as the music comes on.)

2040
01:17:50,625 --> 01:17:51,665
Let's go.

2041
01:17:51,665 --> 01:17:53,936
(This is a party. Thanks, Kwang Soo!)

2042
01:17:55,165 --> 01:17:58,135
(Swing dance is scary, everybody.)

2043
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:02,705
(The swing dance was therapeutic for their body and soul.)

2044
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:06,505
(I'm happy as long as you are.)

2045
01:18:07,915 --> 01:18:10,486
(Kwang Soo pays 320 dollars, and the swing dance is over.)

2046
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,955
Thank you, Kwang Soo.

2047
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,415
- Thank you. - That was very therapeutic.

2048
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:20,425
I paid for it, and it was great.

2049
01:18:20,625 --> 01:18:23,696
I know Ji Hyo wrote my name.

2050
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:25,226
Who was the other one?

2051
01:18:25,366 --> 01:18:26,965
It's already over so there's no point talking.

2052
01:18:26,965 --> 01:18:28,536
- Wasn't it you? - It wasn't me.

2053
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:29,635
(Trust me.)

2054
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:32,335
- Did you write my name? - I didn't.

2055
01:18:32,566 --> 01:18:34,305
I guess I wrote my own name.

2056
01:18:34,436 --> 01:18:36,036
I think you're mistaken.

2057
01:18:36,036 --> 01:18:37,276
I guess I did.

2058
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:39,705
When you were sleeping, Kwang Soo said to pick you.

2059
01:18:39,946 --> 01:18:41,616
- That's not it. - So...

2060
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,576
- I thought we were doing that. - Look at you.

2061
01:18:43,616 --> 01:18:46,686
You are such a jerk.

2062
01:18:46,686 --> 01:18:48,555
Watch this on TV.

2063
01:18:48,555 --> 01:18:50,156
He wanted to make you pay 500 dollars.

2064
01:18:50,215 --> 01:18:52,925
Anyway, he wanted to make you pay.

2065
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:54,226
- Gosh. - I'm serious.

2066
01:18:54,226 --> 01:18:55,396
He wanted to make you pay 500 dollars.

2067
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,995
Haha, let's go for some ramyeon.

2068
01:18:59,465 --> 01:19:00,635
There's one nearby.

2069
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:01,795
(He's searching for a ramyeon buffet.)

2070
01:19:01,795 --> 01:19:03,936
- Ramyeon... - Really?

2071
01:19:03,936 --> 01:19:05,965
(He tries calling them.)

2072
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:07,776
- I hope... - How long would it take?

2073
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:09,635
- Hello? - Hello.

2074
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:11,675
Is this the ramyeon buffet?

2075
01:19:11,906 --> 01:19:14,245
- Yes, it is. - Are you open today?

2076
01:19:14,545 --> 01:19:16,516
- Yes, we are. - Really?

2077
01:19:16,516 --> 01:19:17,946
- Really? - I guess they're not closed.

2078
01:19:18,316 --> 01:19:21,455
This is Yang Se Chan from Running Man.

2079
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:22,955
- Okay. Hello. - Hello.

2080
01:19:22,955 --> 01:19:25,656
Can the eight of us come and eat now?

2081
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:27,555
Yes, it's possible.

2082
01:19:28,326 --> 01:19:30,566
Thank you. We'll be on our way.

2083
01:19:30,795 --> 01:19:32,866
- Yes, thank you. - Thank you.

2084
01:19:33,165 --> 01:19:34,835
I've never been to such place.

2085
01:19:35,295 --> 01:19:36,766
I'm going to make it good.

2086
01:19:36,766 --> 01:19:38,465
(He's planning to fill himself up with good ramyeon.)

2087
01:19:38,665 --> 01:19:43,205
(There's 1 hour and 30 minutes left until the mission is over.)

2088
01:19:43,335 --> 01:19:45,076
Is this the famous...

2089
01:19:45,076 --> 01:19:46,205
- Yes. - Have you been here?

2090
01:19:46,705 --> 01:19:49,175
- Is this a snack stand? - It's like a convenience store.

2091
01:19:49,276 --> 01:19:50,946
- Look at all the ramyeon. - I know.

2092
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:54,585
- Amazing. - I didn't know this place existed.

2093
01:19:54,585 --> 01:19:56,156
There's tteokbokki too.

2094
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:58,255
This is like a department store.

2095
01:19:58,925 --> 01:20:01,156
- Look. - You can pick your toppings.

2096
01:20:01,555 --> 01:20:02,995
This is perfect for me.

2097
01:20:02,995 --> 01:20:05,495
This is perfect for Jae Seok.

2098
01:20:05,495 --> 01:20:06,566
It's therapeutic for him.

2099
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:09,436
- They have jjajang tteokbokki too. - They do.

2100
01:20:09,896 --> 01:20:11,266
- Do they have what I want? - I want this.

2101
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:13,665
(They choose according to preference.)

2102
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:15,476
Should I put in eggs now?

2103
01:20:15,675 --> 01:20:17,545
No, not yet. It has to boil first.

2104
01:20:18,005 --> 01:20:21,476
I didn't know this place existed.

2105
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:24,845
- It's cool that you can make it. - Right?

2106
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:27,555
Jong Kook, this is a great gift for me.

2107
01:20:27,555 --> 01:20:28,955
- This is awesome. - Right?

2108
01:20:28,955 --> 01:20:30,385
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

2109
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:34,425
(They start gulping it down.)

2110
01:20:35,755 --> 01:20:39,066
(It finally seems like they're on vacation.)

2111
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,295
(Jong Kook tries the first frozen tteokbokki of his life.)

2112
01:20:41,936 --> 01:20:43,536
This is like real tteokbokki.

2113
01:20:44,366 --> 01:20:46,736
I didn't know you'd eat this.

2114
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:49,436
(He's eating fast food.)

2115
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:50,776
That's great.

2116
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:52,545
- Were you sitting here, Kwang Soo? - Go ahead.

2117
01:20:55,175 --> 01:20:56,976
(Spurting)

2118
01:20:56,976 --> 01:21:00,915
(She spurts spicy sauce towards Haha.)

2119
01:21:01,455 --> 01:21:03,455
Look what So Min did to me.

2120
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:05,826
(Thanks, So Min.)

2121
01:21:05,826 --> 01:21:08,055
- Look what she did to me. - I'm sorry, Haha.

2122
01:21:08,055 --> 01:21:09,196
It's okay.

2123
01:21:09,295 --> 01:21:10,826
You are kind of scary.

2124
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:12,495
Put it in.

2125
01:21:12,495 --> 01:21:14,335
I have to use the sauce. What do I do?

2126
01:21:14,335 --> 01:21:15,835
This is spicy, So Min.

2127
01:21:16,366 --> 01:21:18,335
I don't have the sauce.

2128
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:20,335
Do you have scissors?

2129
01:21:20,335 --> 01:21:21,476
(She spurts the sauce and collects it back.)

2130
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:24,675
(She swallows it without biting the noodles off.)

2131
01:21:24,675 --> 01:21:25,845
This is awesome.

2132
01:21:26,745 --> 01:21:29,976
(We bought quite a lot.)

2133
01:21:29,976 --> 01:21:34,116
(Who's going to pay here?)

2134
01:21:34,816 --> 01:21:37,085
Let's spin the roulette.

2135
01:21:37,085 --> 01:21:38,585
Let's do that.

2136
01:21:38,726 --> 01:21:41,055
We can stop people from getting near it.

2137
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:44,925
I shouldn't do it. I'm not doing this.

2138
01:21:44,925 --> 01:21:45,925
(He reflects on himself.)

2139
01:21:45,925 --> 01:21:48,036
- What is it? - Somebody did it, right?

2140
01:21:48,665 --> 01:21:49,835
Do what?

2141
01:21:49,835 --> 01:21:51,005
(Do what?)

2142
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:52,036
So Min did, right?

2143
01:21:52,036 --> 01:21:55,276
It doesn't even cost a lot. Let's spin the roulette.

2144
01:21:55,276 --> 01:21:56,705
(This is their chance to unite.)

2145
01:21:56,705 --> 01:21:58,106
We finished the cheese.

2146
01:21:58,106 --> 01:21:59,276
Can we have more cheese?

2147
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:01,576
- Do you want that? - Yes, I do.

2148
01:22:02,276 --> 01:22:03,516
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

2149
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:04,646
(He got caught.)

2150
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:06,816
I'm going to the bathroom.

2151
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:08,555
- Kwang Soo - Where did you go?

2152
01:22:08,856 --> 01:22:10,385
- Kwang Soo. - Let's stop.

2153
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,656
He's addicted.

2154
01:22:12,955 --> 01:22:14,125
It's a disease.

2155
01:22:14,595 --> 01:22:16,295
Everybody,

2156
01:22:16,455 --> 01:22:20,425
you used 78 dollars in total here.

2157
01:22:21,266 --> 01:22:23,036
We can't use it all.

2158
01:22:23,036 --> 01:22:24,465
- We can't use 200 dollars. - We give up.

2159
01:22:24,505 --> 01:22:26,835
- There are 192 dollars left. - We can't use it.

2160
01:22:27,005 --> 01:22:29,236
- We didn't use enough. - We have to do waxing.

2161
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:31,875
We spent less than 10 dollars per person.

2162
01:22:32,705 --> 01:22:35,845
Let's open the golden bell box.

2163
01:22:36,616 --> 01:22:37,885
Did anyone put a name in it?

2164
01:22:37,915 --> 01:22:39,385
I didn't do it this time.

2165
01:22:39,385 --> 01:22:41,215
(They wanted to use the company card this time.)

2166
01:22:41,215 --> 01:22:42,986
Should we eat more of this?

2167
01:22:43,215 --> 01:22:45,156
So many people have participated.

2168
01:22:45,755 --> 01:22:46,856
Really?

2169
01:22:47,156 --> 01:22:48,856
- Really? - There are so many.

2170
01:22:49,396 --> 01:22:51,326
(Jae Seok went to the bathroom 20 minutes ago.)

2171
01:22:51,326 --> 01:22:53,026
Where's the bathroom?

2172
01:22:55,335 --> 01:22:58,266
(He recommends Seok Jin.)

2173
01:23:01,606 --> 01:23:04,345
(We were thinking the same.)

2174
01:23:05,845 --> 01:23:06,946
It's full.

2175
01:23:08,976 --> 01:23:10,446
I'll pay for these two.

2176
01:23:10,816 --> 01:23:12,016
(They've been doing this for 8 years.)

2177
01:23:12,016 --> 01:23:13,116
Don't you have the other kind?

2178
01:23:13,116 --> 01:23:14,816
(They don't trust each other.)

2179
01:23:15,415 --> 01:23:16,786
Oh, gosh.

2180
01:23:17,356 --> 01:23:18,986
We did this again?

2181
01:23:19,156 --> 01:23:20,425
I just hope I don't get picked.

2182
01:23:20,425 --> 01:23:23,526
There's Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Haha.

2183
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,495
- Who wants to pick? - I will.

2184
01:23:26,866 --> 01:23:29,595
- There are so many of Seok Jin. - I'll pick.

2185
01:23:30,436 --> 01:23:31,665
Can he practice?

2186
01:23:31,665 --> 01:23:32,766
- He can't. - No?

2187
01:23:33,165 --> 01:23:34,635
It's 50-50 chance.

2188
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:36,675
I have 50 percent chance.

2189
01:23:37,005 --> 01:23:38,976
- I picked one. - The cost...

2190
01:23:39,205 --> 01:23:40,205
Show it.

2191
01:23:40,205 --> 01:23:44,986
(He already paid 300 dollars earlier and Kwang Soo paid a lot too.)

2192
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:48,486
(Who will end up paying the most?)

2193
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:50,986
(It's on me.)

2194
01:23:50,986 --> 01:23:51,986
Let's see.

2195
01:23:52,186 --> 01:23:54,925
(My gosh)

2196
01:23:55,826 --> 01:23:58,726
- Thank you, Seok Jin. - Thank you.

2197
01:23:58,726 --> 01:24:00,595
Why does this happen?

2198
01:24:00,595 --> 01:24:03,436
Where do we go for the last one?

2199
01:24:04,106 --> 01:24:05,606
Let's go for waxing.

2200
01:24:05,606 --> 01:24:08,375
Since Kwang Soo recommended it, he has to do it.

2201
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:10,305
But is that the rule? He must do it?

2202
01:24:10,305 --> 01:24:13,276
Se Chan got recommended, so he has to do it too.

2203
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:16,576
The person who suggested it has to do it.

2204
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:18,585
Then we'll do it,

2205
01:24:18,585 --> 01:24:20,915
- and we'll pick one more person. - Sure.

2206
01:24:20,915 --> 01:24:22,215
How much money do we have left?

2207
01:24:22,816 --> 01:24:24,726
It's 192 dollars.

2208
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,255
If it's 30 dollars each...

2209
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:27,896
Should we look into it?

2210
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,696
- You should look into it first. - That's important.

2211
01:24:30,696 --> 01:24:32,595
Call a place nearby.

2212
01:24:33,425 --> 01:24:35,736
We have to get the price right too.

2213
01:24:35,736 --> 01:24:37,805
We can figure it out when we get there.

2214
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:38,805
(The waxing service has to be exactly 192 dollars.)

2215
01:24:39,005 --> 01:24:40,675
Yes, this is the waxing shop.

2216
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,705
Hello, is this the waxing shop?

2217
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:45,845
- Yes. - Are you open today?

2218
01:24:46,576 --> 01:24:48,076
- We are. - I see.

2219
01:24:48,345 --> 01:24:50,946
How are the prices like?

2220
01:24:50,946 --> 01:24:52,116
(How are the prices here?)

2221
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:54,186
What parts are you getting it done?

2222
01:24:54,186 --> 01:24:55,616
Excuse me.

2223
01:24:56,186 --> 01:24:59,555
We need to spend 192 dollars.

2224
01:24:59,686 --> 01:25:03,255
I'm sorry. I know this is an odd situation.

2225
01:25:03,656 --> 01:25:07,566
We might need to film us waxing.

2226
01:25:08,295 --> 01:25:10,436
Are you getting the Brazilian waxing?

2227
01:25:10,436 --> 01:25:11,705
- No, no. - No, no.

2228
01:25:11,705 --> 01:25:14,276
(Do you want to get the Brazilian waxing?)

2229
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:16,036
- No, no. - No.

2230
01:25:16,036 --> 01:25:17,406
I'm sorry.

2231
01:25:17,406 --> 01:25:19,406
Why would we get Brazilian and film it?

2232
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,516
No.

2233
01:25:20,646 --> 01:25:22,776
It would be dangerous to film it.

2234
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:25,045
- It has to be on TV. - Not that type of filming.

2235
01:25:25,045 --> 01:25:26,646
- It has to be appropriate. - This is SBS.

2236
01:25:26,646 --> 01:25:28,415
It's on TV.

2237
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:30,726
If not Brazilian...

2238
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:32,226
- Everything but that. - Legs or...

2239
01:25:32,226 --> 01:25:33,856
We can do any other part.

2240
01:25:34,495 --> 01:25:37,526
If we want to use 192 dollars, how many people should we have?

2241
01:25:37,526 --> 01:25:39,095
- It's all men. - It's for men.

2242
01:25:39,326 --> 01:25:41,736
You can get your legs done.

2243
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,635
- Three people? - Legs?

2244
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:44,635
Okay.

2245
01:25:44,635 --> 01:25:46,705
- I'll send you our address. - Okay, thank you.

2246
01:25:46,705 --> 01:25:48,936
- Thank you. - We can check it there.

2247
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:50,106
(The waxing shop is their final stop.)

2248
01:25:50,106 --> 01:25:52,276
(Will they be able to succeed in their mission within 35 minutes?)

2249
01:25:52,276 --> 01:25:53,345
Men and women?

2250
01:25:53,505 --> 01:25:55,375
- Yes, it's for both. - Hello.

2251
01:25:55,375 --> 01:25:56,375
It's separate.

2252
01:25:56,415 --> 01:26:00,146
It's for three men. Does it hurt a lot?

2253
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:04,585
Well, the pain is inevitable.

2254
01:26:04,585 --> 01:26:06,986
If it's 192 dollars, what parts are they doing it?

2255
01:26:07,085 --> 01:26:08,995
2 people on their legs and 1 person on a single leg.

2256
01:26:08,995 --> 01:26:11,526
(1 person will get a single leg done.)

2257
01:26:11,526 --> 01:26:12,566
No way.

2258
01:26:13,396 --> 01:26:15,095
We have to match the price.

2259
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:16,995
- It's his first time. - The price doesn't work out.

2260
01:26:16,995 --> 01:26:20,205
Can we do this then? The person who will get one leg done...

2261
01:26:20,205 --> 01:26:22,476
- 1 of 3? - Yes, it'll be 1 out of 3 of you.

2262
01:26:22,476 --> 01:26:24,005
Can we get three changes of clothes?

2263
01:26:24,005 --> 01:26:26,745
- Sure. - You can come over here.

2264
01:26:26,906 --> 01:26:30,686
This is so painful. Every week is so bad.

2265
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:33,215
Please. I can't get waxing done.

2266
01:26:33,316 --> 01:26:34,786
I think Seok Jin is a good candidate.

2267
01:26:35,016 --> 01:26:36,486
You have 30 minutes left.

2268
01:26:36,486 --> 01:26:37,925
We have to hurry.

2269
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:39,686
Let's pick one.

2270
01:26:39,686 --> 01:26:42,196
We won't waste time.

2271
01:26:42,295 --> 01:26:45,196
When you all put down your heads, we'll throw this on top.

2272
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,495
- I have to tell this to my wife. - Please hurry up.

2273
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:49,696
I'll remember this.

2274
01:26:52,236 --> 01:26:53,736
(This person will join Kwang Soo and Se Chan.)

2275
01:26:53,736 --> 01:26:56,036
- Just a moment please. - Make up your mind.

2276
01:26:56,036 --> 01:26:57,036
Just a moment.

2277
01:26:57,675 --> 01:27:00,106
- Don't do that. You scared me. - Put your head down.

2278
01:27:00,106 --> 01:27:02,816
- Please put your head down. - Please.

2279
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:04,915
I have to go somewhere with Dream.

2280
01:27:04,915 --> 01:27:06,715
Stop mumbling.

2281
01:27:06,715 --> 01:27:08,116
- Okay. - Please join us...

2282
01:27:08,116 --> 01:27:09,656
Please, sir.

2283
01:27:09,656 --> 01:27:11,625
Which member will join us?

2284
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:13,585
We'll pick now. One.

2285
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,026
Put your head down. Two.

2286
01:27:16,026 --> 01:27:21,396
(Who did Kwang Soo and Se Chan pick?)

2287
01:27:21,795 --> 01:27:22,835
Two.

2288
01:27:27,066 --> 01:27:29,875
(Seok Jin got picked.)

2289
01:27:30,005 --> 01:27:31,705
It worked.

2290
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,205
It's not me.

2291
01:27:33,205 --> 01:27:35,446
Thank you. Thank you so much!

2292
01:27:35,516 --> 01:27:37,816
- Respect. - Respect.

2293
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:39,516
Respect.

2294
01:27:39,516 --> 01:27:40,755
He wanted to do it.

2295
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,316
- He wasn't even nervous. - He thinks it's obviously not him.

2296
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:45,755
What do you mean? My heart was beating fast.

2297
01:27:45,755 --> 01:27:47,356
Should we do rock-paper-scissors?

2298
01:27:47,356 --> 01:27:48,656
Let's do rock-paper-scissors for one leg.

2299
01:27:48,656 --> 01:27:50,566
Do rock-paper-scissors and decide who it'll be.

2300
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:51,795
Is it the loser or the winner?

2301
01:27:51,795 --> 01:27:52,795
The loser.

2302
01:27:52,995 --> 01:27:54,135
Rock-paper-scissors

2303
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:56,665
(Se Chan wins.)

2304
01:27:56,665 --> 01:27:58,335
- Okay. - This is driving me nuts.

2305
01:27:58,465 --> 01:27:59,465
Thank you.

2306
01:28:00,036 --> 01:28:01,305
I won.

2307
01:28:01,305 --> 01:28:03,906
Do rock-paper-scissors. We have no time.

2308
01:28:03,906 --> 01:28:05,946
- There are 15 minutes left. - I don't want to do just 1 side.

2309
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:07,745
I really don't want that.

2310
01:28:07,745 --> 01:28:09,276
We have 15 minutes. Hurry.

2311
01:28:09,276 --> 01:28:10,316
Rock-paper-scissors.

2312
01:28:11,045 --> 01:28:13,915
(This is between the two people who paid the most today.)

2313
01:28:13,915 --> 01:28:16,385
(Who will get one leg waxed and pay the fees?)

2314
01:28:16,385 --> 01:28:17,425
Rock-paper-scissors.

2315
01:28:18,255 --> 01:28:21,196
(It's Seok Jin.)

2316
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:25,566
(Seok Jin gets to have one leg waxed and pay the fees.)

2317
01:28:25,925 --> 01:28:28,595
(The Sinsa-dong Mudfish is completely ruined today.)

2318
01:28:29,396 --> 01:28:31,465
- This is... - This is how it feels like.

2319
01:28:31,465 --> 01:28:33,606
It's so nice. It'll be quick.

2320
01:28:34,005 --> 01:28:36,576
I guess people film here. I had no idea.

2321
01:28:36,576 --> 01:28:38,906
We only have 20 minutes left. Let's hurry.

2322
01:28:38,906 --> 01:28:40,205
- Let's hurry. - Hurry.

2323
01:28:40,205 --> 01:28:41,646
- We have no time. - Hug the stuffed animal.

2324
01:28:41,646 --> 01:28:43,316
What's this?

2325
01:28:43,316 --> 01:28:45,316
- Is it that bad? - It won't hurt that much.

2326
01:28:45,316 --> 01:28:46,686
There's a stuffed animal to hug?

2327
01:28:47,486 --> 01:28:50,116
- I don't want to do it. - I have no hair.

2328
01:28:50,116 --> 01:28:51,955
- It'll be very painful. - Is it really bad?

2329
01:28:52,826 --> 01:28:54,095
I think it will.

2330
01:28:54,095 --> 01:28:55,726
Kwang Soo, it'll be worst for you.

2331
01:28:55,726 --> 01:29:00,665
That must be painful. His hair looks like ivy.

2332
01:29:00,665 --> 01:29:02,536
They are tangled up.

2333
01:29:02,536 --> 01:29:04,705
That looks like a rifle.

2334
01:29:04,705 --> 01:29:05,705
(Are you ready?)

2335
01:29:06,005 --> 01:29:07,476
What's this?

2336
01:29:07,476 --> 01:29:09,505
He put it on. I'm done. I have to do it.

2337
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:12,175
He's going to rip it now.

2338
01:29:12,175 --> 01:29:13,545
(He keeps on talking.)

2339
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:14,875
This is driving me crazy. What did I do wrong?

2340
01:29:15,415 --> 01:29:17,316
That hurts already.

2341
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:19,486
You have the most amount of hair.

2342
01:29:19,486 --> 01:29:20,486
Hold on, sir.

2343
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:22,585
Hold on.

2344
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:25,786
Are you doing it already? Sir.

2345
01:29:28,326 --> 01:29:30,896
(He starts without warning since they have no time.)

2346
01:29:31,425 --> 01:29:32,625
(Look at all that hair.)

2347
01:29:32,625 --> 01:29:34,766
Wait. Wait a minute.

2348
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,165
(It's clean.)

2349
01:29:37,165 --> 01:29:38,566
(That really hurts.)

2350
01:29:38,566 --> 01:29:40,606
It really hurts.

2351
01:29:40,936 --> 01:29:42,936
I'm serious.

2352
01:29:42,936 --> 01:29:44,146
Does it really hurt?

2353
01:29:45,476 --> 01:29:48,175
(This is not the vacation I had in mind.)

2354
01:29:49,146 --> 01:29:52,215
(He wrote waxing this morning...)

2355
01:29:52,215 --> 01:29:55,116
(only to tease Se Chan.)

2356
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:57,726
(You're lucky I stopped with waxing!)

2357
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,026
(I was going to make you shave your head.)

2358
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:03,595
(He thought only Se Chan would have to do it.)

2359
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:06,526
(This is what he gets for his actions.)

2360
01:30:07,436 --> 01:30:09,465
(Look at his face.)

2361
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:12,406
Get his hands.

2362
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:14,005
- Does it hurt? - Please slow down.

2363
01:30:14,036 --> 01:30:15,476
Slow down.

2364
01:30:18,606 --> 01:30:20,745
(That was unexpected.)

2365
01:30:21,646 --> 01:30:23,516
Excuse me. How could you?

2366
01:30:23,516 --> 01:30:25,415
(They never had such rude customers.)

2367
01:30:27,085 --> 01:30:28,786
That hurts.

2368
01:30:29,186 --> 01:30:30,885
We only have five minutes.

2369
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:32,186
If we don't finish, do we fail?

2370
01:30:32,186 --> 01:30:33,255
Flip over.

2371
01:30:34,295 --> 01:30:36,396
They have no mercy.

2372
01:30:36,755 --> 01:30:40,295
They really have no mercy.

2373
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:42,866
That's how you are supposed to do it.

2374
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,665
That's my flesh. You just pinched me.

2375
01:30:44,665 --> 01:30:45,805
No, it's not.

2376
01:30:46,036 --> 01:30:48,106
- I think it's my flesh. - My gosh.

2377
01:30:48,135 --> 01:30:50,205
Look. Kwang Soo's legs are so pretty.

2378
01:30:50,205 --> 01:30:51,875
His legs are really pretty.

2379
01:30:52,305 --> 01:30:57,215
I'm worried about Seok Jin. What is he going to do with the other leg?

2380
01:30:57,215 --> 01:30:59,085
You should pay now.

2381
01:30:59,745 --> 01:31:01,555
- Pay now. - We are in trouble.

2382
01:31:02,286 --> 01:31:04,455
(They are almost done waxing with 3 minutes left.)

2383
01:31:04,455 --> 01:31:06,786
Why did you write this down, Kwang Soo?

2384
01:31:06,786 --> 01:31:07,795
(He's losing it.)

2385
01:31:07,795 --> 01:31:09,795
You are done. I'll hold you, Se Chan.

2386
01:31:09,826 --> 01:31:11,396
It's clean.

2387
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:13,396
Thank you for the good work.

2388
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:15,736
Kwang Soo, look at your legs. They're so smooth.

2389
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:17,436
Yours look better that way.

2390
01:31:19,106 --> 01:31:21,005
(It's much cleaner.)

2391
01:31:21,005 --> 01:31:22,536
It's clean. It's nice.

2392
01:31:22,536 --> 01:31:23,705
They turned like this?

2393
01:31:24,175 --> 01:31:27,175
(They were hairy men.)

2394
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:32,116
(Now, they are hairless.)

2395
01:31:32,316 --> 01:31:35,316
You have successfully completed all the missions.

2396
01:31:35,316 --> 01:31:37,226
(Do Whatever You Want race is finally over.)

2397
01:31:37,226 --> 01:31:38,486
We are finally done.

2398
01:31:38,856 --> 01:31:40,995
- Good job - Good job

2399
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,755
- Good work - Good work

2400
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:44,396
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2401
01:31:44,396 --> 01:31:45,726
Thank you for the food.

2402
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:47,495
(Running Man members will run even harder next week.)

2403
01:31:47,995 --> 01:31:49,566
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

2404
01:31:49,995 --> 01:31:51,005
(They are...)

2405
01:31:51,635 --> 01:31:54,776
You can't run a restaurant here. Where's your boss?

2406
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:56,005
(They are united over their comedic skills.)

2407
01:31:56,576 --> 01:31:57,576
Are you here by yourself?

2408
01:31:57,705 --> 01:31:59,076
Who are you?

2409
01:31:59,205 --> 01:32:00,516
(The best in Korea)

2410
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:03,845
(Mungdol Gang, the beautiful criminals)

2411
01:32:03,845 --> 01:32:08,156
(Yuchen Gang, the worst-looking gangsters)

2412
01:32:08,156 --> 01:32:12,686
(Ma Jong Kook, the squad detectives)

2413
01:32:12,686 --> 01:32:14,925
(Kang Daniel, every lady's heartthrob)

2414
01:32:14,925 --> 01:32:17,095
(Jo Se Ho, also known as Jo Daniel)

2415
01:32:17,095 --> 01:32:18,896
(Ha Yeon Soo, every guy's heartthrob)

2416
01:32:18,896 --> 01:32:20,396
(Noh Sa Yeon, the godmother of the entertainment business)

2417
01:32:20,795 --> 01:32:22,766
(Kang Daniel...)

2418
01:32:22,766 --> 01:32:25,165
(versus Kwang Daniel)

2419
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:27,776
(The crazy war has started.)

2420
01:32:28,576 --> 01:32:30,406
(City of Crime, next Sunday at 4:50pm)
