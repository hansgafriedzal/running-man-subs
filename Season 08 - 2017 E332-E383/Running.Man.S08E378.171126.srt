1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,095
(Incheon International Airport on the day of departure for penalties)

2
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,531
People at the airport are in a frenzy.

3
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,333
They don't look so bad in the outfits.

4
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,202
(Oh, my goodness. Look at their outfits.)

5
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:17,704
- It looks like Kwang Soo owns it. - Poor Haha.

6
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:19,939
- It looks like Kwang Soo owns it. - It's as I expected.

7
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,242
Kwang Soo, it looks like you tried to dress up.

8
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:23,743
(What are the outfits that attract their attention?)

9
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:25,845
- Jong Kook and Haha... - It seems they have a unique theme.

10
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:28,815
(The Fashionable Trio: Airplane, Box, and Scales)

11
00:00:28,815 --> 00:00:30,283
- Kwang Soo... - They don't look that bad.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,553
- seems like he dressed up. - Exactly.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,423
(Confident poses of men with a true sense of fashion)

14
00:00:36,423 --> 00:00:38,558
Isn't it nice? It will be a popular look in Japan.

15
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:39,693
I think Kwang Soo owns the outfit.

16
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:43,530
(They didn't fathom that their last week's penalty would be so moving.)

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,032
If this is our airport fashion, shouldn't we bring our luggage?

18
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:48,335
- You guys look nice. - Shouldn't we have our luggage?

19
00:00:48,802 --> 00:00:51,738
Do you remember how Haha insisted on taking the box outfit?

20
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:54,574
(Do you remember how Haha insisted on taking the box outfit?)

21
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:57,544
(This is the best out of the three.)

22
00:00:57,544 --> 00:00:58,778
(You're still picky even now.)

23
00:00:58,778 --> 00:01:00,146
- You know these outfits? - This is the best one.

24
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:01,881
It's better to wear something that completely stands out.

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:04,250
Otherwise, people think that's your real sense of fashion.

26
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,385
- Do you get it? - Yes.

27
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:07,854
(So when Haha chose the outfit first,)

28
00:01:07,854 --> 00:01:10,824
(he was happy to get the box outfit.)

29
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,360
- But you... - Just to wear that outfit...

30
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,795
Did you work hard just to wear that outfit?

31
00:01:15,962 --> 00:01:19,332
Now that I'm wearing this outfit, his outfit looks much cooler.

32
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,201
(I think the airplane outfit looks better.)

33
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:23,336
- You look so weird. - What about Kwang Soo's outfit?

34
00:01:23,336 --> 00:01:25,872
- Jong Kook looks like an artist. - Me?

35
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:27,540
- Doesn't it look nice? - It does.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,843
Whenever he walks, the airplanes fall.

37
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:32,479
(The planes drop just like his confidence does whenever he walks.)

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,214
- He had way more than that. - The amusement park...

39
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:36,049
- That one is much better. - It looks like you own the outfit.

40
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,450
Kwang Soo, you should just come to this side.

41
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:39,085
- Kwang Soo. - It looks like it's your outfit.

42
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,420
- What? - Isn't that his?

43
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,288
- Who would wear this? - Just come here.

44
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:43,957
Everyone can agree that this is made for him.

45
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,426
- Look at the length of the pants. - I agree.

46
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:48,361
(The pants length is customized for Kwang Soo, the model.)

47
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:50,263
How can it fit him perfectly?

48
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:52,866
It fits with his hairstyle.

49
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:59,139
Everyone, today is the day you'll depart for your penalties at last.

50
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:01,708
Do you remember the project, A Place for One Percent?

51
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,677
Haha and Se Chan were selected to ride Nevis Swing in New Zealand.

52
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,579
- We are going at last. - Among the viewers watching...

53
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,149
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo were picked to try Cage of Death...

54
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,118
In Australia for the project, Half and Half Tour.

55
00:02:12,118 --> 00:02:13,620
- It was from Half and Half Tour. - That's not scary at all.

56
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:16,156
- We just got our visas to go now. - The penalties...

57
00:02:16,156 --> 00:02:18,691
Four of you were exempted from participating in the penalties,

58
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,760
but So Min and Seok Jin will join them on their trip to Australia.

59
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,831
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook will join them on their trip to New Zealand.

60
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:27,567
We're tagging along just to tease them, right?

61
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:29,335
On these penalty trips,

62
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,838
- your decisions will cause results. - Really?

63
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:33,807
Today's special is called Swallowtail Butterfly Tour.

64
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,208
(Small decisions will cause big results.)

65
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:37,577
(Excuse me, Haha.)

66
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:40,680
- Stop hitting me with your box. - I'm sorry.

67
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,248
- Stop hitting him. - I just got too excited.

68
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:45,285
My goodness.

69
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:47,187
Is there a chance for us to redeem ourselves?

70
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:50,590
For this penalty trip, the place of your penalty was modified.

71
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,258
- For Haha and Se Chan... - That's right!

72
00:02:52,258 --> 00:02:53,660
who might feel it's unfair,

73
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,563
- we prepared six special chances. - Awesome!

74
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:58,665
(The staff prepared a set of 6 special chances.)

75
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,034
Wait, Haha. It hurts.

76
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,136
- Are you serious? - All right.

77
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:05,104
However,

78
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:08,308
advantages and disadvantages are mixed in this set of chances.

79
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:09,375
(It's a mix of both?)

80
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:13,046
Team Australia and Team New Zealand will each choose...

81
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:14,914
- three Chance Cards randomly. - Chance Cards?

82
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:18,451
You can only read the Chance Cards when you accomplish...

83
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,087
the given missions presented to you in each country.

84
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:24,457
- You can also refuse to use them. - Okay!

85
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,292
We can refuse to use it?

86
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:28,528
- Seriously? - We've been wronged!

87
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,530
- We didn't choose this destination. - That's right, Haha.

88
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,831
(What are these random Chance Cards?)

89
00:03:31,831 --> 00:03:34,167
"We won't receive it." "We will get it."

90
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,536
- What are these? - "We will go."

91
00:03:36,736 --> 00:03:39,072
"We will do it." "We won't receive it." "We will get it." "We will go."

92
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:40,907
- Is it, "We won't receive money"? - All right.

93
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,408
(Team New Zealand chooses...)

94
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,743
"We'll be..."

95
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,178
- "exempted from the penalty." - That's right.

96
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,480
- "We won't get the penalty." - "We won't get the penalty."

97
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,883
- "We all won't do the penalty." - "We all won't do the penalty."

98
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:50,884
Look at this.

99
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,586
(They choose three cards accordingly.)

100
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,257
"We won't go to the penalty place."

101
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:59,959
"We'll have our meal."

102
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,061
- "We'll go home." - "We'll go home."

103
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:04,364
"We'll go home," is the best one.

104
00:04:04,364 --> 00:04:05,398
(Team Australia also chooses their cards.)

105
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:07,033
- Hey. - This might be correct.

106
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:09,502
- "We won't go to a penalty place." - Choose a good one.

107
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:11,237
Kwang Soo, stand with Team Australia.

108
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:13,506
Why are you pretending to be in their team?

109
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,807
(I don't want to look out of place.)

110
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:16,442
- You're wearing your own outfit. - It's not that.

111
00:04:16,442 --> 00:04:18,411
- It wasn't a penalty for you. - Stop acting like you're with them.

112
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,680
You're wearing your own outfit. Gosh, you stand out too much.

113
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,849
- It does look like your outfit. - Look at them.

114
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,485
Let me just stay with them.

115
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:28,454
(I miss standing with them.)

116
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:31,057
- Hey, line them up. - Please!

117
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:33,026
All right. So you have chosen your three Chance Cards.

118
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,461
Right now, the cards are covered. After you accomplish your missions,

119
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,730
you can choose one of the cards and read all of them.

120
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,566
That's the only way we can read them?

121
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,603
However, you can refuse to use the Chance Cards...

122
00:04:43,603 --> 00:04:45,872
- even if you accomplish missions. - We have a choice.

123
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,342
Swallowtail Butterfly Tour will begin now.

124
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:50,910
We'll head to the boarding gate now as you are.

125
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,612
- Okay! - Okay.

126
00:04:52,845 --> 00:04:54,347
- Look at Kwang Soo. - In this outfit?

127
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:55,982
It really looks like he owns the outfit.

128
00:04:55,982 --> 00:04:58,551
How am I going to use the toilet in this outfit?

129
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,520
- You should remove the airplanes. - I have to take off everything.

130
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,854
- Remove some of the airplanes. - My goodness.

131
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:04,557
Do we have scissors? Make a hole in Haha's outfit for the toilet.

132
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:06,826
(Do we have scissors? Make a hole in Haha's outfit for the toilet.)

133
00:05:07,927 --> 00:05:09,596
(Their journey to the gate is complicated and humiliating.)

134
00:05:09,596 --> 00:05:11,164
This is humiliating.

135
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:14,300
- Which way is it? - Stay as a group.

136
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,569
I need to stand between them.

137
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,605
This is driving me crazy.

138
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,672
Don't you think it's ready by now?

139
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:22,475
I'm also carrying out a penalty too.

140
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:24,677
Kwang Soo, why did you dress up?

141
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:26,212
My outfit is a penalty too.

142
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,380
(They have a long way ahead.)

143
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:31,484
(They'll travel to Sydney together and then part ways.)

144
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:36,723
(They make a domestic transfer to Darwin.)

145
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:44,664
Why are you waving at the camera all of a sudden?

146
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:47,367
Do you think this is a travel TV show?

147
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:50,169
You're not on a trip to have fun.

148
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:52,005
Why did you do that?

149
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:53,039
Join me, Jae Seok.

150
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,308
We are here to carry out the penalty.

151
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:56,776
I want to at least feel like I'm traveling.

152
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,177
(I wish it was a trip, not a penalty.)

153
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,882
The in-flight mission will begin now.

154
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,420
(We filmed under cooperation of the crew and passengers.)

155
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,454
Let me see.

156
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:11,958
"When the seatbelt light is turned off, pick one representative...

157
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,959
and find Producer Jung Hae.

158
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,462
(1 presentative must find Producer Jung Hae. The assigned seat is 4B.)

159
00:06:16,462 --> 00:06:17,530
What did you say?

160
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,699
- 4B. - 1 of us must go to 4B.

161
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,834
- Should I go? - Yes, So Min. You should go.

162
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:25,038
When they give you the mission, share it with us.

163
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,039
(He's nagging.)

164
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:27,607
Don't try to deceive us again.

165
00:06:27,974 --> 00:06:28,975
(A close-up shot of a chatterbox)

166
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:29,976
- So Min. - Yes?

167
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:33,513
(She films a close-up shot of the chatterbox.)

168
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:34,681
- So Min. - Yes?

169
00:06:35,982 --> 00:06:37,617
(She studies Kwang Soo's facial features.)

170
00:06:37,617 --> 00:06:39,318
Just go to 4B. Go to 4B.

171
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,454
- Go to 4B. - Go to 4B.

172
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:45,825
(Where is 4B?)

173
00:06:48,594 --> 00:06:49,962
What if she can't find the seat?

174
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:50,997
(I'm right here.)

175
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,668
Hello.

176
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:57,970
(It's packed with staff members, and yet, you couldn't find me.)

177
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,172
Hello.

178
00:06:59,172 --> 00:07:02,542
(She closes up on him out of embarrassment.)

179
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,946
The first mission with the Chance Card on the line,

180
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:09,415
Relay Crocodile Quiz will begin.

181
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,951
(Relay Crocodile Quiz)

182
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:14,287
You succeed if 3 out of 4 members answers correctly.

183
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:16,956
Here comes the first question.

184
00:07:18,725 --> 00:07:23,029
Crocodiles are reptiles within the subfamily of Crocodylinae...

185
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:26,833
with tough scales that cover their backs from head to tail.

186
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,235
Their leather...

187
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,304
is made into expensive handbags and belts...

188
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:35,208
when it has a great number of scales and beautiful patterns.

189
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,542
In that case,

190
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:40,146
(This is the first question with the Chance Card on the line.)

191
00:07:40,146 --> 00:07:42,215
does this crocodile wallet contain...

192
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,885
10 dollars and above or not?

193
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:50,189
I still can't get used to these kinds of quizzes.

194
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:51,791
10 dollars and above?

195
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,426
Yes or no?

196
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:58,531
(Does the crocodile wallet contain 10 dollars and above or not?)

197
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:03,035
The production staff doesn't give us a lot of money.

198
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:04,537
Even if the wallet is expensive,

199
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,773
I think it contains less than 10 dollars.

200
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:10,610
(I think it contains less than 10 dollars.)

201
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:12,378
- It contains less than 10 dollars. - Yes.

202
00:08:13,346 --> 00:08:14,347
Please check.

203
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:16,315
(It's time to check her answer.)

204
00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:22,789
(10-dollar bill)

205
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,659
(1-dollar bill)

206
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:28,628
- How much money does it contain? - 11 dollars.

207
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:30,963
(She fails to get the 1st question right.)

208
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:32,732
You failed to get the 1st question right.

209
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,400
For goodness' sake.

210
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:37,236
Since you failed the mission,

211
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,704
please put your lip print...

212
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:41,707
on this acrylic board as big as you can.

213
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:44,944
(What? My lip print?)

214
00:08:44,944 --> 00:08:46,312
- My lip print? - Yes.

215
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:50,616
What is So Min doing over there?

216
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,485
Look. She is doing something on her own.

217
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,554
- What is she doing? - She is looking at the mirror.

218
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:55,721
Is she looking at the mirror?

219
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:57,657
I just need to make it as big as possible, right?

220
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:58,925
(I just need to make it as big as possible, right?)

221
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:00,259
The thickness doesn't matter, right?

222
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,028
As big as possible.

223
00:09:02,028 --> 00:09:04,564
(She draws big lips.)

224
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:06,799
(If you have small lips, draw big lips.)

225
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,067
That was unnecessary.

226
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,303
It needs to be a print.

227
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,771
Okay, I will give you my lip print.

228
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:12,972
(Why is she going this far?)

229
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:18,644
(Her lips are scary enough to make Joker run away.)

230
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:20,313
I need to print my lips before the lipstick dries.

231
00:09:22,448 --> 00:09:25,418
(She kisses the acrylic board)

232
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:29,622
(She makes the print big and clear.)

233
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:33,292
(She laughs like a middle-aged man.)

234
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:37,196
(She leaves her lip print on the acrylic board.)

235
00:09:37,196 --> 00:09:38,865
Here comes the next question.

236
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:40,433
Do I need to answer it?

237
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,468
No, when I give you the question,

238
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,871
bring someone you think would know the answer.

239
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:47,073
Do I get to keep this?

240
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,743
No, please give it back to me.

241
00:09:50,743 --> 00:09:51,911
(I can't let you have it.)

242
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:54,013
He picked you, right?

243
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:55,748
I...

244
00:09:56,816 --> 00:10:00,519
(What were you up to?)

245
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,787
What did you paint on your lips?

246
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,456
- What is that? - You look like a clown.

247
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,392
Jae Seok.

248
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:07,793
- You... - Jae Seok.

249
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,629
- What? - You should go.

250
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,297
Go.

251
00:10:11,297 --> 00:10:12,665
It must be the mission.

252
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,167
Good luck, Jae Seok. Please succeed.

253
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,303
(So Min's face tells me...)

254
00:10:17,303 --> 00:10:19,538
(that this mission won't be easy.)

255
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,773
Here comes the question.

256
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:22,174
- It's the second question. - What is this?

257
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:24,777
Please put a lip print...

258
00:10:24,777 --> 00:10:26,545
that is bigger than So Min's.

259
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:28,814
(Put a lip print that is bigger than So Min's.)

260
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:31,284
(What?)

261
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:34,153
(Open your mouth like a crocodile and put a lip print.)

262
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,488
- Bigger than So Min's? - Yes.

263
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:38,157
(Revealing the 2nd question to So Min)

264
00:10:38,157 --> 00:10:40,893
Please bring someone...

265
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:43,729
who will be able to put a lip print that is bigger than yours.

266
00:10:43,796 --> 00:10:46,098
- You may not reveal the question. - Okay.

267
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:47,633
(She may not reveal the question.)

268
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:52,038
(She walks over to Jae Seok without worrying much.)

269
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:53,506
So Min...

270
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:55,308
didn't have to paint beyond her lips, did she?

271
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,442
(I don't understand why she painted beyond her lips.)

272
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,710
What is wrong with her?

273
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,479
Excuse me.

274
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:02,548
Excuse me.

275
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:05,051
She doesn't mind her face.

276
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,152
"Excuse me."

277
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,421
(The clown calls over the flight attendant without shame.)

278
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:09,789
Aren't you embarrassed of your face?

279
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:11,557
I need to erase it quickly.

280
00:11:13,025 --> 00:11:15,361
It's okay because Jae Seok will soon be in this state.

281
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,063
- Shall I go? - Yes.

282
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:19,665
(Can Jae Seok succeed when he only painted his lips?)

283
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,867
(Opening his mouth wide)

284
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:28,407
(He does the mission like an aggressive crocodile.)

285
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,278
I did it.

286
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,146
(So Min's lip print and Jae Seok's lip print.)

287
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:36,282
Did I succeed?

288
00:11:36,282 --> 00:11:37,550
(The mission is a success.)

289
00:11:37,683 --> 00:11:40,686
- So Min failed, and you succeeded. - Okay.

290
00:11:40,686 --> 00:11:42,888
Here comes the third question. The third one is...

291
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,557
Crocodile Telepathy.

292
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,058
Go back to your seat,

293
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,694
choose a member who will be the best at telepathy,

294
00:11:48,694 --> 00:11:50,162
and send him over here.

295
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:55,034
(Choose a member who will be the best at telepathy.)

296
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,802
There is no such member.

297
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,838
Telepathy?

298
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,374
You succeeded.

299
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,709
Yes. Kwang Soo.

300
00:12:04,076 --> 00:12:06,045
- What is it? Did you succeed? - Yes. Go.

301
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:10,149
(He heads over to the producer without knowing about the mission.)

302
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,584
Here comes the third question.

303
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,953
Okay. It's a quiz.

304
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,721
The ancestor of crocodiles is...

305
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,891
Postosuchus of the Jurassic Period.

306
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,059
Postosuchus.

307
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:21,994
Here comes the question.

308
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:23,963
In that case,

309
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:26,899
yell either "Croco" or "Dile".

310
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:29,268
You fail if you yell the same word as me.

311
00:12:31,037 --> 00:12:32,138
Crocodile.

312
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:34,306
(Between "Croco" and "Dile",)

313
00:12:34,306 --> 00:12:36,275
(say the one that is different from the one the producer chooses.)

314
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,610
1, 2, 3.

315
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,912
1, 2, 3.

316
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,481
1, 2, 3.

317
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,217
- Croco. - Crod.

318
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:47,553
("Croco" and "Crod")

319
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:48,754
"Crod" isn't an option.

320
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:50,289
"Crod" isn't an option. "Codil" isn't either.

321
00:12:50,289 --> 00:12:51,524
- Start. - All right.

322
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:52,958
1, 2, 3.

323
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:54,160
- Croco. - Croco.

324
00:12:56,162 --> 00:12:57,196
Come on.

325
00:12:57,196 --> 00:12:58,264
(Please give me one more chance.)

326
00:12:58,264 --> 00:12:59,965
- I will give you one more chance. - Okay.

327
00:13:00,132 --> 00:13:01,267
Here we go.

328
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,668
1, 2, 3.

329
00:13:02,668 --> 00:13:03,836
- Dile. - Dile.

330
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,906
(With 2 out of 4 members out, the Relay In-flight Mission fails.)

331
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:08,107
Shall I leave?

332
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:10,376
1, 2, 3.

333
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,544
- Croco. - Croco.

334
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,512
1, 2, 3.

335
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:15,514
(They are in sync like the members of a choir.)

336
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:17,783
(Kwang Soo is upset.)

337
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:18,818
How are you doing this?

338
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:20,619
Are you reading my mind? How are you doing this?

339
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,389
- You failed. - How are you doing this?

340
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:24,757
Please go back to your seat.

341
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,991
May we try one more time?

342
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:28,360
- One more time. - This is your last chance.

343
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:30,029
1, 2, 3.

344
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,297
- Dile. - Dile.

345
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:35,901
(For goodness' sake.)

346
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,838
(Their "cooperation" results in a failure.)

347
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:43,542
(Team Nevis Swing is heading to New Zealand.)

348
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:44,844
Half and Half Rock-Paper-Scissors?

349
00:13:45,177 --> 00:13:47,713
(Half and Half Rock-Paper-Scissors)

350
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:51,317
(The producer and 2 members play rock-paper-scissors in turn.)

351
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:54,520
(The mission is a success if there are 2 wins and 2 losses.)

352
00:13:55,154 --> 00:13:57,189
The two of you should go first.

353
00:13:57,289 --> 00:13:58,390
Ji Hyo should go first.

354
00:13:58,657 --> 00:14:00,292
We have it easy.

355
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,161
It doesn't matter if we win or lose.

356
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,195
Let's go.

357
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,331
Rock-paper-scissors

358
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:06,832
I lost.

359
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:07,900
(1 loss)

360
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,168
Rock-paper-scissors

361
00:14:09,168 --> 00:14:10,302
(Scissors, paper)

362
00:14:10,436 --> 00:14:11,804
- I lost. - You lost.

363
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:14,173
- Both of you need to win. - Win.

364
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,641
(Both of them need to win.)

365
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:21,280
(Both of them need to win for the Chance Cards.)

366
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,382
(Can Jong Kook start the miracle of the Chance Cards?)

367
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,284
Rock-paper-scissors

368
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:27,253
(Rock, paper)

369
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,123
(There is no miracle.)

370
00:14:31,123 --> 00:14:33,125
(They fail to acquire the Chance Cards.)

371
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,326
Did we fail?

372
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,796
(I can't believe you failed us.)

373
00:14:37,796 --> 00:14:38,898
(Watch me.)

374
00:14:38,898 --> 00:14:40,032
Come on.

375
00:14:42,902 --> 00:14:44,637
How are you so good at rock-paper-scissors?

376
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,172
He is good at rock-paper-scissors.

377
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:49,375
(Both teams fail to win the Chance Cards.)

378
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,911
(They fly for three more hours...)

379
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:55,681
(and arrive at Queenstown, New Zealand.)

380
00:14:56,148 --> 00:15:00,753
(The nature of New Zealand is clean and clear.)

381
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,087
1, 2, 3.

382
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:05,291
(The production crew is waiting for the members to come out.)

383
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,796
(10 minutes pass.)

384
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:13,399
(Even after 30 minutes, the members don't come out.)

385
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,667
Why aren't they coming out?

386
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,168
Let me check.

387
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,942
We are stepping on land after hours.

388
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,410
This is incredible.

389
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:26,278
This is nice.

390
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:28,280
(The air is nice.)

391
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,883
(They get to see New Zealand...)

392
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,419
(two hours after landing.)

393
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:36,689
We are stepping on land after many complications.

394
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,890
New Zealand!

395
00:15:38,057 --> 00:15:40,526
I have never seen...

396
00:15:40,526 --> 00:15:42,061
people get caught for so long...

397
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:45,431
- at a tourist's destination. - A place full of pain, New Zealand

398
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:47,666
(No one is in their right minds.)

399
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:48,901
Let's go, Ha Pills.

400
00:15:48,901 --> 00:15:50,202
- Ha Pills. - Ha Pills.

401
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:51,503
- Let's go, Ha Pills. - We have a lot to share.

402
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:52,571
We have a lot to share.

403
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:55,641
- Yang No Name. Song Kwan Tae. - Yang No Name.

404
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:57,810
For goodness' sake.

405
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:01,247
(The four of them come out with new nicknames.)

406
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,615
I am very curious...

407
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:04,450
about why we got out so late.

408
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:06,385
How did this happen?

409
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,487
Let's go over the first story.

410
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:10,322
Let's talk about Ha Pills.

411
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:12,491
I say this all the time,

412
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:14,059
but immigration check scares me.

413
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:16,061
I become anxious because I don't speak English.

414
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:18,797
- What did Haha say? - Haha gave me...

415
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:21,433
some words of courage.

416
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:22,868
- However... - "Se Chan."

417
00:16:22,868 --> 00:16:24,870
"Se Chan, don't worry."

418
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:26,472
"No problem."

419
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:28,607
He continued to say those words.

420
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,311
(Se Chan, don't worry. No problem.)

421
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:34,947
At the immigration check to enter Australia,

422
00:16:34,947 --> 00:16:37,516
I was trembling, and Haha went ahead of me.

423
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:39,685
He told the immigration officer,

424
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:41,253
"My crew."

425
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,188
"Oh, crew. Okay."

426
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,624
Then he stamped my passport.

427
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,493
I told Haha that he was my hero.

428
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,028
Haha continued to say,

429
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:50,929
"Don't worry, no problem."

430
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:52,197
He continued to say that.

431
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,632
I trusted him.

432
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:55,834
However, the immigration check was tougher at New Zealand.

433
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,002
Haha said,

434
00:16:57,002 --> 00:16:58,137
"Se Chan."

435
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,841
"No problem. Don't worry." I said okay. A moment later,

436
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:05,277
- someone stopped Haha. - He was stopped.

437
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,914
"Why? What's wrong?"

438
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:12,751
(Surprised)

439
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:14,186
"Me?"

440
00:17:14,186 --> 00:17:16,555
- I didn't say that. - You did.

441
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:19,091
Say just what actually happened.

442
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:21,293
- They took his baggage. - They took my baggage.

443
00:17:21,293 --> 00:17:25,364
The sniffer dog started sniffing at my baggage...

444
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:29,702
and barked. They opened my baggage and found two anxiety pills.

445
00:17:29,702 --> 00:17:31,103
(They found two anxiety pills.)

446
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:32,438
(It was for Nevis Swing.)

447
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:36,575
I was so surprised. I said, "Trust me."

448
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:39,111
- You said that too many times. - He said, "Follow me."

449
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:40,946
"These pills are popular in Korea."

450
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:42,915
"Very popular."

451
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:45,317
- My goodness. - My goodness.

452
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:48,287
- They took him somewhere. - They took me somewhere.

453
00:17:48,554 --> 00:17:52,091
I was so annoyed. A woman patted me on the back.

454
00:17:52,091 --> 00:17:54,860
- She was very nice. - They were nice.

455
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,529
She told me nicely, "You're not allowed to bring these."

456
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:00,299
I said, "But it's very famous in Korea."

457
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,868
She still said no. I just got my digestion pills back.

458
00:18:03,602 --> 00:18:05,571
That's why my nickname is...

459
00:18:06,305 --> 00:18:09,441
- Ha Pills. - Ha Pills.

460
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,543
Meanwhile...

461
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:15,247
Meanwhile, something hilarious happened.

462
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:18,217
While your baggage was being checked,

463
00:18:18,217 --> 00:18:21,286
someone wanted to take a picture with me.

464
00:18:21,286 --> 00:18:24,256
Se Chan was behind me. As he's a member too,

465
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:26,358
I told him to come.

466
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:27,860
She was being nice.

467
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,728
That person was getting ready to take a picture,

468
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:31,330
and I approached.

469
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,732
She looked at her phone screen and then at me.

470
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:35,067
(She looked at Se Chan.)

471
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,435
- "Who are you?" - "Who are you?"

472
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:38,871
She looked so serious. "Who are you?"

473
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:41,039
(Why are you ruining my picture with Ji Hyo?)

474
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,541
- Was she Korean? - Yes.

475
00:18:42,741 --> 00:18:44,276
"Me?" So...

476
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:47,012
- Ji Hyo said I was a member too. - I said, "He's a member too."

477
00:18:47,012 --> 00:18:48,447
"Really?"

478
00:18:48,547 --> 00:18:51,016
In the end, she let me be in the picture.

479
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,618
And then she said,

480
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,287
- "What's your name?" - "What's your name?" I got hurt.

481
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:58,123
That's why your nickname is Yang No Name.

482
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,525
(It's a sad story.)

483
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,293
I'm Yang No Name.

484
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,195
- Work harder. - I will.

485
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:05,364
Ji Hyo's new nickname is...

486
00:19:05,364 --> 00:19:07,466
- I'm sorry. - Song Kwan Tae.

487
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,868
Hi, Kwan Tae.

488
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,805
Why did you...

489
00:19:12,871 --> 00:19:15,441
We stopped over in Australia on the way to New Zealand.

490
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,476
Ji Hyo wasn't showing up.

491
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:19,211
Then we heard an announcement.

492
00:19:19,278 --> 00:19:21,246
It was in Korean.

493
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:23,315
Ms. Cheon Soo Yeon.

494
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:25,918
They were looking for Ms. Cheon Soo Yeon.

495
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:28,554
When she got there, it turned out...

496
00:19:28,787 --> 00:19:30,956
- her baggage... - The thing is...

497
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,458
belonged to Mr. Kim Kwan Tae.

498
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,628
(5 hours ago at Sydney Airport)

499
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:39,298
Ji Hyo took someone else's baggage.

500
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:40,732
Really?

501
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,534
Her baggage is still on the carousel.

502
00:19:42,568 --> 00:19:44,670
- Mr. Kim is looking for his. - Unbelievable.

503
00:19:45,037 --> 00:19:46,939
- Mr. Kim, we're sorry. - We're sorry.

504
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:49,107
- Our member made a mistake. - She did.

505
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,976
Please forgive her. Have a nice trip.

506
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:52,277
We're sorry.

507
00:19:52,277 --> 00:19:53,579
Kwan Tae.

508
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,514
My goodness.

509
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:59,451
Ji Hyo picked up that baggage so confidently.

510
00:19:59,451 --> 00:20:01,019
- She did. - "That's mine."

511
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,488
- Right? - "That's mine."

512
00:20:03,088 --> 00:20:05,023
"Is that yours?" "Yes."

513
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:08,794
Ji Hyo, he must have been as surprised as you were.

514
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,098
Mr. Kim, I'm sorry. I took your baggage by mistake.

515
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:15,801
I sincerely apologize.

516
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:19,705
I don't care about anything else. We just need Jong Kook.

517
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:21,640
You're right.

518
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,476
Look. It's beautiful.

519
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,212
I've seen this place on TV.

520
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,781
- That's permanent snow, right? - Yes. It never melts.

521
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:31,750
(Queenstown is a popular vacation spot for the locals too.)

522
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,619
- It's so beautiful. - It's so sunny.

523
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:36,722
You'll see a really beautiful lake soon.

524
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:37,789
It's so picturesque.

525
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,558
It was where "The Lord of the Rings" was shot.

526
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,293
- Really? - Oh, really?

527
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,462
- It's so beautiful, right? - It is.

528
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:46,732
It was such a long journey.

529
00:20:46,732 --> 00:20:50,536
I'm so happy to finally see this.

530
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:54,540
This street is so beautiful. We should get out.

531
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,308
(They randomly decided to get out of the car.)

532
00:20:56,308 --> 00:21:00,112
- It's so nice. - It's fantastic.

533
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:03,415
- The weather is perfect. - This is it.

534
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,484
It's crazy.

535
00:21:06,118 --> 00:21:09,221
Are we really here for the penalty?

536
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,491
Se Chan, it's so nice here.

537
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:14,993
It's so beautiful here.

538
00:21:14,993 --> 00:21:16,862
- Shouldn't we take a picture? - Let's do that.

539
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:18,764
Ji Hyo, come here.

540
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:21,333
Come close.

541
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,035
1, 2, 3.

542
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:25,470
(Kwan Tae, Jong Kook, Pills, and No Name)

543
00:21:25,804 --> 00:21:28,106
Thank you, guys. I'm here thanks to you.

544
00:21:28,807 --> 00:21:30,542
- It's beautiful. - It's crazy.

545
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:32,978
Gosh.

546
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:34,079
(The weather here is crazy too.)

547
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,380
It took so long.

548
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:38,584
How many hours was it?

549
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:40,118
We're finally here.

550
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:41,320
(Scruffy)

551
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,088
Did it take two days?

552
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:45,757
- I can't breathe. - It's very humid.

553
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:47,693
- It's humid. - It's the rainy season here.

554
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,194
The weather is...

555
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:51,930
- It's so humid. - It's very hot.

556
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,298
I'm the only one wearing a sweater.

557
00:21:53,298 --> 00:21:54,700
- We're finally here. - I look like I'm in Korea.

558
00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:57,703
(For the unlucky ones, even the weather is bad.)

559
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:59,538
- It's raining. - It's raining.

560
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:01,106
- It's the rainy season. - It's...

561
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:04,643
- It's the rainy season. - It is, and it's also off-season.

562
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:06,812
Shouldn't crocodiles take a rest?

563
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:08,513
Wouldn't they be sensitive now?

564
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:10,482
On the way here...

565
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:12,417
We've never been to Darwin before.

566
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:15,287
Everyone we met on the way said,

567
00:22:15,287 --> 00:22:17,389
- "Why would you go there?" - "Darwin?"

568
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:19,358
"What can you do there around this time?"

569
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:21,259
"Everything must be closed now."

570
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:24,930
Even Koreans living here said, "Not many have been there."

571
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,299
It's near the equator.

572
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,769
It takes four and a half hours from Sydney.

573
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:32,204
By airplane.

574
00:22:32,204 --> 00:22:33,472
It's raining. Excuse me.

575
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,573
It's...

576
00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:35,874
- What about us? - heavy rain.

577
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:39,478
(Go on, you guys.)

578
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:41,780
- What? - It's like the Amazon.

579
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,515
- We were just starting to talk. - It started raining so hard.

580
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,317
I haven't seen this heavy rain in a long time.

581
00:22:45,317 --> 00:22:47,119
Come here.

582
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,554
It's raining so hard.

583
00:22:49,554 --> 00:22:51,523
(They hurriedly get in the car.)

584
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:54,693
It's raining so hard.

585
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:57,529
You failed to complete the in-flight mission.

586
00:22:57,529 --> 00:22:59,464
You're not allowed to open the mission bag.

587
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:03,135
How are we going to see the crocodiles?

588
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,038
Only Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will see them.

589
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:07,139
Oh, right.

590
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,640
Why are you two here?

591
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,108
- I don't know. - I don't know.

592
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:13,378
You two surprised Kwang Soo in the airplane.

593
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,080
- He even took a picture. - I was shocked.

594
00:23:15,247 --> 00:23:17,883
- I was going to the bathroom. - You were mistaken.

595
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:20,218
They were...

596
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:23,321
sitting next to each other, holding hands.

597
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:24,790
I was so shocked.

598
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,991
(Were they holding hands?)

599
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:30,195
You were mistaken.

600
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:33,765
(They were both Seok Jin's hands.)

601
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:36,501
- You were mistaken. - I was so shocked.

602
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:38,904
It was so cowardly of me.

603
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,573
I just accepted it and went to the bathroom.

604
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:44,743
- That's ridiculous. - I just ignored it.

605
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:46,812
You're making me look weird.

606
00:23:46,812 --> 00:23:48,947
I was mistaken.

607
00:23:49,047 --> 00:23:51,349
- I was so flustered. - The picture looks so convincing.

608
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:54,753
- Wherever So Min goes, - Something goes wrong.

609
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:57,289
- Ridiculous things happen. - absurd things happen.

610
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,558
Wherever So Min goes, something weird happens.

611
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:02,360
And it's always something inappropriate.

612
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,062
It's always a bit dirty.

613
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:05,063
(It's always inappropriate for TV.)

614
00:24:05,063 --> 00:24:06,131
- Right. - I don't understand.

615
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:08,233
I don't know what is wrong with my life.

616
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:10,268
That's very well said. It's always inappropriate.

617
00:24:10,268 --> 00:24:11,403
It is.

618
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:14,473
We'll arrive at a park near our hotel soon.

619
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,408
- All right. - Let us take a shower.

620
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:17,609
- I want to take a shower. - I want to wash myself.

621
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:19,611
- I need to wash my hair. - I need a shower.

622
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:21,813
To be honest, and I know I'm no different,

623
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,716
but I was passing by So Min, and she smelled bad.

624
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:28,687
(The actress smells bad.)

625
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:30,689
So Min hasn't washed her hair in a while.

626
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:31,857
- It's itchy. - Does your hair smell?

627
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,792
No. Your hair smells too.

628
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,528
- Should we smell each other's hair? - No.

629
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:38,296
I want to see how bad it is.

630
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,765
- Stop it. - Let's do it.

631
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,566
- Hair? - Yes.

632
00:24:42,033 --> 00:24:43,068
(Smell my hair.)

633
00:24:43,068 --> 00:24:44,269
Take a big whiff.

634
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:46,338
(How does So Min's hair smell?)

635
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:53,211
(Laughing)

636
00:24:53,678 --> 00:24:55,747
So Min, smell Kwang Soo's.

637
00:24:56,014 --> 00:24:57,682
(Is it that bad?)

638
00:24:57,682 --> 00:24:59,050
- Smell Kwang Soo's hair. - It smells so bad.

639
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:00,719
- I was so surprised. - See?

640
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:02,387
- It's bad, right? - I was so shocked.

641
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:03,855
I smelled it too.

642
00:25:03,855 --> 00:25:05,757
It's like someone punched me in the nose.

643
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,126
- Smell Kwang Soo's hair. - I was so shocked.

644
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,728
- Let's not do it. - Come on.

645
00:25:09,728 --> 00:25:12,030
- Don't do it. - Come here.

646
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,298
Gosh.

647
00:25:13,298 --> 00:25:16,368
(It even looks dirty.)

648
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,837
- I think it'll smell bad. - It's going to smell terribly.

649
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:23,275
(How bad does Seok Jin's hair smell?)

650
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:24,476
Here.

651
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:26,511
Gosh!

652
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:30,715
(Jae Seok is furious.)

653
00:25:30,782 --> 00:25:33,118
Gosh. Kwang Soo, it's real.

654
00:25:33,118 --> 00:25:35,086
- Goodness. - I'm not acting.

655
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:36,488
(Is it that bad?)

656
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:37,823
How...

657
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:45,230
(Laughing)

658
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,631
- I can't believe it. - Hey.

659
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,433
It smells like tom yum goong.

660
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,469
Did you have tom yum goong?

661
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:53,238
(It smells like Asian food.)

662
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:54,840
So Min.

663
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,975
- It smells like tom yum goong. - Smell it.

664
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,276
- Exactly like tom yum goong. - So Min.

665
00:25:58,276 --> 00:26:00,445
I've never smelled anything this bad.

666
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:03,748
Someone probably poured tom yum goong over his head.

667
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:04,749
Smell it.

668
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,518
Take a big whiff.

669
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,620
Gosh.

670
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:11,189
(Frowning)

671
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:12,791
It smells weird.

672
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,993
- It's tom yum goong, right? - It smells like toast.

673
00:26:14,993 --> 00:26:16,494
- Toast? - Toast?

674
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:17,562
That sounds nice.

675
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:18,997
Toast smells good.

676
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:20,398
Gosh.

677
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:22,567
It smells almost like poop.

678
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:23,602
Let me smell yours.

679
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:25,136
He smells like an old man.

680
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:26,972
I don't smell that bad, do I?

681
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,807
It smells okay. It's annoying.

682
00:26:30,342 --> 00:26:32,277
I'm sorry. After smelling Seok Jin's hair,

683
00:26:32,277 --> 00:26:34,079
I lost the ability to smell.

684
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:35,347
I can't smell anything.

685
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,315
- Seok Jin smells the worst. - Seriously.

686
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:39,985
The viewers won't like it.

687
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:41,820
It's impossible to like the smell of your hair.

688
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:44,489
It's terrible.

689
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,791
When your hair smells that bad and you scratch your head,

690
00:26:47,092 --> 00:26:49,461
- you get stuff under your nails. - Right.

691
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:51,096
It's awful.

692
00:26:51,096 --> 00:26:52,163
Show me your nails.

693
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,299
- Why? - They might be dirty.

694
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:55,667
This is what I saw.

695
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:59,037
(Are they caught?)

696
00:26:59,204 --> 00:27:01,273
- What? - That was the moment.

697
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:02,307
That was the moment.

698
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:03,808
(It seems familiar.)

699
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,543
- That was exactly it. - No way.

700
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,178
- Gosh. - Isn't it true?

701
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,515
Gosh, I'm tired of it.

702
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:11,683
Are you the new Monday Couple?

703
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,285
No, we aren't.

704
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:17,289
I'm okay with that, but what about So Min?

705
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,890
Don't ruin my future.

706
00:27:19,557 --> 00:27:21,526
We're here.

707
00:27:21,526 --> 00:27:22,594
(Where did Team Australia arrive?)

708
00:27:23,028 --> 00:27:24,796
There's a view of the sea.

709
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:27,732
- The trees look amazing. - It's beautiful here.

710
00:27:27,766 --> 00:27:29,200
It's the sea.

711
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,036
What are those?

712
00:27:31,036 --> 00:27:33,471
- As soon as we arrive... - What are they?

713
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:34,539
They're cans.

714
00:27:35,206 --> 00:27:37,542
What are they? Are those pickled cans?

715
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:39,811
It's a boomerang.

716
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:41,112
(There's even a boomerang.)

717
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:44,482
Here's your mission for the second Chance Card.

718
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:46,618
The mission for the second Chance Card...

719
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:49,054
is called Fly Like a Butterfly, Throw the Boomerang.

720
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,790
(Fly Like a Butterfly, Throw the Boomerang)

721
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,193
Throw the boomerang used for hunting in Australia...

722
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:59,030
to hit the cans with Australian specialty products written on them.

723
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:02,067
You must acquire all the products written on the cans that...

724
00:28:02,067 --> 00:28:04,035
you've missed within the time limit.

725
00:28:04,102 --> 00:28:06,037
Otherwise, you fail.

726
00:28:06,037 --> 00:28:07,605
- Find them here? - What are they?

727
00:28:07,605 --> 00:28:09,107
- Find them here? - If we hit...

728
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:10,775
all of them, we don't have to find anything?

729
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:12,043
- No. - If we hit all of them.

730
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:13,778
(It's important to hit many cans.)

731
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:17,082
Get out of the way, Seok Jin.

732
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:22,053
(Jae Seok makes a scene.)

733
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:24,322
So Min, get out of the way. You'll get hurt.

734
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:26,491
Don't throw it in our direction.

735
00:28:27,025 --> 00:28:28,493
You're trying to act cool.

736
00:28:28,526 --> 00:28:30,061
- Throw it like this. - I'm scared.

737
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,930
Be careful. That's not how to do it.

738
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,931
(Shall I try it?)

739
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:34,299
It won't fly, Kwang Soo.

740
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,333
Move out of the way.

741
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:37,102
Do you know a lot about boomerang?

742
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:39,671
(Do you know a lot about boomerang?)

743
00:28:40,271 --> 00:28:41,840
Have you ever seen a boomerang?

744
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,443
My nickname was Yoomerang when I was a child.

745
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:46,578
No way.

746
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,413
What are you talking about?

747
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:50,949
- Hold it like this. - Isn't it the other way?

748
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:51,950
Like this.

749
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,718
Throw it low. Kwang Soo.

750
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,620
It's raining,

751
00:28:56,254 --> 00:28:57,989
so consider everything before throwing.

752
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,859
Jae Seok, take off your leggings first.

753
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,660
(It's not time to brag.)

754
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,597
- Jae Seok. - What are you talking about?

755
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:06,765
(He's wearing tight leggings.)

756
00:29:07,132 --> 00:29:09,467
- Aren't those pajamas? - Isn't it the boyfriend look?

757
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:11,669
- My goodness. - Seriously.

758
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:14,639
I didn't wear them for the shoot.

759
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,441
Do you wear them for yoga?

760
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:20,145
I wore these to be comfortable on the plane.

761
00:29:20,745 --> 00:29:24,282
It feels great to run on the lawn.

762
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:28,486
(Seok Jin suddenly feels free as he runs across the green lawn.)

763
00:29:28,486 --> 00:29:29,521
It's amazing.

764
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:31,890
- Seok Jin. - It's amazing.

765
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,892
It's great to run on the lawn.

766
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:35,026
(He's so excited.)

767
00:29:35,026 --> 00:29:36,327
It's great to run on the lawn.

768
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:37,295
He's lying.

769
00:29:37,295 --> 00:29:38,329
(However, he's lying.)

770
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:39,597
(No, I'm not.)

771
00:29:39,597 --> 00:29:40,698
It feels great.

772
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,700
Is he trying to act young?

773
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:45,236
It feels really good.

774
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:46,638
Try running.

775
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:48,640
- Give it a try. It's great. - Seok Jin.

776
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,141
He's trying to act energetic.

777
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,543
Try running. It's great.

778
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:54,479
He said it was great to run, but he wasn't running.

779
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,681
(His running was slower than his walking.)

780
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,784
(It's because the flight was long.)

781
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:02,821
- I'll give it a try. - It's because of the game.

782
00:30:03,054 --> 00:30:05,023
- I'll give it a try. - I didn't use much,

783
00:30:05,023 --> 00:30:06,758
but it says that I used up all my data for the day.

784
00:30:06,891 --> 00:30:09,194
- I'll give it a try. - It's because of the game.

785
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,329
- I'll give it a try. - You told me to download it.

786
00:30:11,329 --> 00:30:12,464
I didn't use up mine.

787
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,933
- Challenge. - Why didn't you use wireless?

788
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:16,367
(She's determined.)

789
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,236
Let me try.

790
00:30:18,236 --> 00:30:20,538
He told me to download a game, so I did.

791
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,507
- I used up all my data... - Why didn't you...

792
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:24,042
- for the day. - I'm going to play.

793
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:26,744
It says that I used up my data for the day.

794
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:28,746
You told me to download a game.

795
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:30,748
Challenge. Please show me some interest.

796
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:33,785
I didn't use the internet, but I don't have any data left.

797
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:35,687
- It can't be helped. - Seriously.

798
00:30:35,954 --> 00:30:36,988
I'll turn mine on.

799
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:38,923
What is the function called?

800
00:30:39,357 --> 00:30:40,358
Go ahead, So Min.

801
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:42,260
Wait, So Min. We were talking.

802
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,995
We need a conclusion.

803
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:45,230
(Wait, So Min.)

804
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,498
When can I go?

805
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:49,100
What is the sharing of internet called?

806
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,802
- You don't listen. - Jackspot?

807
00:30:50,802 --> 00:30:53,938
(Is it called jackspot?)

808
00:30:53,938 --> 00:30:55,206
"Jackspot"?

809
00:30:55,206 --> 00:30:56,441
Do you even know?

810
00:30:56,441 --> 00:30:57,509
It's called hotspot.

811
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:59,344
(Do you mean hotspot?)

812
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:01,246
Stay by my side.

813
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:03,047
You're my base station from now on.

814
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:04,415
(It doesn't matter how it's called.)

815
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:07,385
I downloaded a game because of you.

816
00:31:07,385 --> 00:31:09,754
Now, I used up my data as soon as I arrived.

817
00:31:09,754 --> 00:31:12,524
- Challenge. - It's time for you to play.

818
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:14,359
- It's real this time. - I'll throw this time.

819
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,426
So Min is up.

820
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:17,595
Here I go.

821
00:31:17,595 --> 00:31:22,467
(There's no need to find the product written on the can that she hits.)

822
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:25,370
- You got it. - It hit the can.

823
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:28,606
(So Min fails.)

824
00:31:28,606 --> 00:31:29,807
I told you not to do that.

825
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:31,676
You stepped on the line.

826
00:31:32,043 --> 00:31:33,211
You can't step on the line.

827
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:35,180
- Don't step on the line. - Play fair.

828
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,049
So Min, we have to play fair.

829
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,418
- Right. I'm sorry. - Many people are watching us.

830
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:43,521
I'm sorry. I'll play fair.

831
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:45,456
(She exposes her head.)

832
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:46,991
The smell drifted away.

833
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:49,360
Are you polluting the air...

834
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,996
- in Australia? - No wonder I smelled something.

835
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,431
How could you?

836
00:31:53,431 --> 00:31:55,567
You really need to wash your hair.

837
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,068
Get out of the way.

838
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:58,937
(Seok Jin goes next.)

839
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:01,306
(Swinging)

840
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:03,274
I didn't say, "challenge".

841
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:06,878
(He doesn't play fair by not saying the word.)

842
00:32:06,878 --> 00:32:08,780
- I should say, "challenge". - Start again.

843
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:10,548
Challenge.

844
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,251
I think Seok Jin is talented...

845
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,987
- Be quiet. - in sports.

846
00:32:16,387 --> 00:32:18,790
Be quiet. I need to concentrate.

847
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,892
(A talented athlete tries to concentrate.)

848
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:22,160
(It flies off.)

849
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:25,330
(That was so close.)

850
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,497
It wasn't close at all.

851
00:32:26,497 --> 00:32:28,199
It didn't go far enough.

852
00:32:28,199 --> 00:32:30,468
- It wasn't close at all. - It didn't go far.

853
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:32,904
- Not at all. - I thought a baby was throwing it.

854
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,707
Give it to me. I'll do it.

855
00:32:36,107 --> 00:32:37,141
Move out.

856
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:40,078
- I'm upset right now. - Jae Seok.

857
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:45,316
(No one was successful. Yoomerang takes action.)

858
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:49,087
(Will Yoomerang hit the cans?)

859
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,023
- That's right. - Jae Seok.

860
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:53,224
(Yoomerang succeeds.)

861
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:54,459
Nice shot.

862
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:55,893
- You did it. - How many is it?

863
00:32:56,027 --> 00:32:57,028
- Is it one? - I got it.

864
00:32:57,028 --> 00:32:58,062
Didn't I hit three?

865
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,897
We'll count the knocked out ones.

866
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,933
- Three cans. - You don't have to buy them.

867
00:33:01,933 --> 00:33:03,968
- What is it? "Manuka honey". - Do we have to go out?

868
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:05,503
It's a type of honey.

869
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:08,573
(It's a famous Australian honey that's good for digestion.)

870
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:10,108
Do we have to go out?

871
00:33:10,108 --> 00:33:11,309
(He wants to taste it.)

872
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:12,777
(It explodes.)

873
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:13,778
Goodness.

874
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:17,515
(He's forced to dance with the fizz.)

875
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:19,651
Gosh, what is he doing?

876
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:22,754
Did you have to do that?

877
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,589
I wanted to drink it.

878
00:33:24,589 --> 00:33:25,590
(He's disappointed.)

879
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,025
Why are you drinking it?

880
00:33:27,025 --> 00:33:28,760
(I'm just going to drink it.)

881
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:30,862
Can we each play one last time?

882
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:32,196
Each of you get one more chance.

883
00:33:32,196 --> 00:33:33,331
Okay.

884
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:34,866
- Let's be serious. - Let's go.

885
00:33:34,866 --> 00:33:36,467
- So Min. - Come here, So Min.

886
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,970
It's okay even if we fail.

887
00:33:39,237 --> 00:33:40,638
It's difficult.

888
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,507
(Jae Seok gains confidence.)

889
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:43,508
Make it curve.

890
00:33:43,508 --> 00:33:44,776
(Jae Seok gains confidence.)

891
00:33:44,776 --> 00:33:48,780
(Will he succeed again?)

892
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,381
You got it.

893
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:52,817
(He hits another can.)

894
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:54,319
- He got it. - Did you hit it?

895
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,586
You didn't say, "challenge". Try it again.

896
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,021
(He didn't say challenge.)

897
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:58,623
- I did. - You didn't.

898
00:33:58,623 --> 00:33:59,891
- No way. - You didn't say it.

899
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:01,626
- Didn't you hear me? - I heard you.

900
00:34:01,626 --> 00:34:02,994
- What do you mean? - I said it.

901
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:04,195
- I heard him say it. - I said it.

902
00:34:04,195 --> 00:34:05,997
- He succeeded. - Why did you whisper it?

903
00:34:05,997 --> 00:34:07,498
- Why? - Did you say it or not?

904
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,734
He really whispered it.

905
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,602
- No way. - Can't he say it in silence?

906
00:34:11,602 --> 00:34:12,637
It's because...

907
00:34:12,637 --> 00:34:13,738
(He said it in his head.)

908
00:34:13,738 --> 00:34:16,174
my Saturday show stopped shooting.

909
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:19,844
I lost confidence. Do I have to explain that?

910
00:34:20,278 --> 00:34:21,913
- The broadcast network... - But that's...

911
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,348
Why if we don't want to say it?

912
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:26,451
All of us work in entertainment. I'm going through a tough time.

913
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:29,354
- Is it my fault that... - In that case...

914
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:30,588
I couldn't say the word?

915
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:31,622
(Is it my fault?)

916
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,261
(The word "challenge" has a special meaning for him.)

917
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:41,699
(We can empathize with Jae Seok's sad story.)

918
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,835
- He's so strict. - That's so mean.

919
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:45,370
I don't know about this.

920
00:34:46,537 --> 00:34:48,906
I wonder what Haha would think about it.

921
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:50,208
He did say the word.

922
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:52,243
He whispered it.

923
00:34:52,243 --> 00:34:54,345
Is it important whether he said it or not?

924
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,615
Don't you consider his feelings at all?

925
00:34:57,615 --> 00:34:58,950
Forget it.

926
00:35:00,118 --> 00:35:02,120
One day, I'll shout out the word as much as I want.

927
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:04,589
Jae Seok, I'm rooting for you.

928
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:05,990
Challenge!

929
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,025
(Jae Seok gets another chance.)

930
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,194
Let's say it together.

931
00:35:10,428 --> 00:35:11,763
- Let's do it together. - That's better.

932
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:14,699
- Shout, "challenge" together. - In 1, 2, 3.

933
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,200
- Challenge. - Challenge. That's it.

934
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,969
- This is right. - I agree.

935
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,303
This is teamwork.

936
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,573
- It's more sincere. - This is teamwork.

937
00:35:23,374 --> 00:35:28,679
(Will saying, "challenge" together be effective?)

938
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,984
(She hits a can.)

939
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:36,587
- It's because we said it together. - It worked.

940
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:38,022
They're spirulina...

941
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,258
- and vegemite. - Thank goodness.

942
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:42,760
Spirulina is a health product.

943
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,096
Vegemite is a type of jam in Australia.

944
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:46,798
- All right. - Let's say it together.

945
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:48,266
Let's do it together.

946
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:50,101
- In 1, 2, 3. Challenge. - Challenge.

947
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,602
(Jae Seok gets another chance.)

948
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:53,838
Okay.

949
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,473
(He hits 2 cans.)

950
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:56,641
- 2. - 2 cans.

951
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:57,642
That's right.

952
00:35:57,642 --> 00:35:59,710
(He's truly Yoomerang after all.)

953
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:01,012
"Crocodile jerky".

954
00:36:01,813 --> 00:36:02,880
"Didjeridu".

955
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:05,116
- What's that? - "Didjeridu".

956
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:08,453
(Didjeridu is the Aborigine's musical instrument.)

957
00:36:08,953 --> 00:36:11,055
Didjeridu is Australia's traditional instrument.

958
00:36:11,055 --> 00:36:12,990
- Didjeridu? - Didn't I say it right?

959
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,826
- Didjeridu? - Didjeridu.

960
00:36:15,493 --> 00:36:18,663
Don't laugh at me. You already knew the name.

961
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:20,164
Isn't it didjeridu?

962
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:21,966
- Didjeridu? - Didjeridu.

963
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:23,601
You mispronounced it.

964
00:36:23,601 --> 00:36:26,737
Carry the cans with you, and buy the products...

965
00:36:26,737 --> 00:36:28,473
on your own.

966
00:36:28,473 --> 00:36:30,107
- "Crocodile". - "Chain".

967
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:31,742
- Is it a key chain? - Take the cans with you.

968
00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:32,877
- How about this one? - Look.

969
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:34,245
"Kangaroo skin" is kangaroo lotion.

970
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:37,548
(What's this?)

971
00:36:37,548 --> 00:36:38,683
That's not it.

972
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,186
- It means leather. - It's the skin.

973
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:44,355
We need to find kangaroo leather?

974
00:36:44,355 --> 00:36:45,656
How?

975
00:36:45,656 --> 00:36:46,858
It isn't lotion.

976
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:48,926
Do you think kangaroos use lotion?

977
00:36:49,327 --> 00:36:51,329
Do you think kangaroos...

978
00:36:51,329 --> 00:36:52,930
carry lotion in their pouches...

979
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,398
- and use it? - How many do we have?

980
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:56,868
I thought they made it out of kangaroos.

981
00:36:57,268 --> 00:36:58,569
- We have 5 items. - 5 items.

982
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,105
Let's go to the nearby mart.

983
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:02,940
- Okay. - Let's go.

984
00:37:03,908 --> 00:37:05,376
(The items they need to get)

985
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,911
(Golden Wattle, Kangaroo meat, Kangaroo skin,)

986
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:08,379
(Crocodile paw key chain, Kangaroo paw key chain)

987
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:11,849
(Meanwhile, the happy Team New Zealand...)

988
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:12,950
My gosh.

989
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:14,285
It's so beautiful.

990
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:15,753
- This view is crazy. - It's gorgeous.

991
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:19,857
It's time for your second Chance Card mission.

992
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:22,026
What is this Chance Card for?

993
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:23,561
I think it's going to be something good.

994
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:26,998
New Zealand is where jet boats...

995
00:37:26,998 --> 00:37:28,766
were first invented.

996
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:29,967
Really?

997
00:37:29,967 --> 00:37:31,869
Since we're at the motherland of jet boats,

998
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,038
let's try a mission that's going to be full of thrill and excitement.

999
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:35,973
Here's the second mission.

1000
00:37:36,474 --> 00:37:38,376
It's The Memory Skills of the Tiger.

1001
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,510
"The Memory Skills of the Tiger"?

1002
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,245
(The Memory Skills of the Tiger)

1003
00:37:41,245 --> 00:37:42,380
Are you talking about me?

1004
00:37:42,547 --> 00:37:43,748
No. The tiger's.

1005
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:45,449
There's a place in New Zealand...

1006
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:47,351
that was listed in the Guinness World Records...

1007
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:51,289
as the longest official place name in the world.

1008
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:52,456
The longest name of a place?

1009
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:56,060
If you succeed in memorizing the name of this place...

1010
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,630
after a 10-minute, jet boat ride,

1011
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,432
you'll be able to get a Chance Card.

1012
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,700
That's way too easy.

1013
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,303
- How long could it be? - How long is it?

1014
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:07,838
I'm pretty sure the four of us will be able to memorize that.

1015
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,309
- Hold this part. - Okay.

1016
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:12,476
(What's the longest place name in the world?)

1017
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,649
- My gosh. - No way.

1018
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:20,117
Is this the correct name?

1019
00:38:20,117 --> 00:38:21,185
How can the four of us...

1020
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:25,289
(How can there be a place with a name like this?)

1021
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,657
How can the four of us...

1022
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:28,125
(It has 45 letters.)

1023
00:38:28,125 --> 00:38:30,494
- This is practically a sentence. - Wait a minute.

1024
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:32,330
What does it say? Try reading it.

1025
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,600
"Taumatawhakatangihanga..."

1026
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,768
"koauauo..."

1027
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:41,105
- "tamateaturipukaka..." - My gosh, this is way too long.

1028
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:45,476
"pikimaungahoronukupokaiwhe..."

1029
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,912
"nuakitanatahu."

1030
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,381
Bring me a New Zealander who can actually memorize this.

1031
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:52,850
- This is so unexpected. - My gosh.

1032
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,086
Bring me someone who actually memorizes this.

1033
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:03,661
(Here's a New Zealander who can memorize the name.)

1034
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:06,330
This place is located...

1035
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,433
in southern Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.

1036
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,869
It's a name of a hill that's located near Porangahau.

1037
00:39:11,969 --> 00:39:14,138
- They named it too long. - It's too long.

1038
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:15,973
- There's a total of 85 letters. - 85 letters?

1039
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:19,644
It was listed in the Guinness World Records, and this is what it means.

1040
00:39:19,644 --> 00:39:23,247
"The summit where Tamatea, a mountain climber with big knees,"

1041
00:39:23,247 --> 00:39:26,550
"played the flute for his loved one."

1042
00:39:26,951 --> 00:39:28,219
This is...

1043
00:39:28,219 --> 00:39:29,553
- This is way too much. - This is...

1044
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:32,556
How are we supposed to memorize this?

1045
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:34,759
1, 2, 3, 4,

1046
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:36,827
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1047
00:39:36,827 --> 00:39:40,064
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

1048
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:42,099
- 1, 2, 3, 4... - Is that how you count?

1049
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,467
(What in the world are you doing?)

1050
00:39:44,468 --> 00:39:46,037
That means there are 10... No, wait.

1051
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:47,872
Can't you continue counting after 10?

1052
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,373
Can't you continue on with 11 and 12?

1053
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,975
I get confused.

1054
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:53,844
- How does that confuse you? - There are 45 letters.

1055
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:56,847
- That's more confusing. - It's confusing.

1056
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:58,582
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

1057
00:39:58,582 --> 00:39:59,917
7, 8, 9, 10.

1058
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:02,453
- 11, 12. That's better. - 11, 12, 13, 14,

1059
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:04,221
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

1060
00:40:04,221 --> 00:40:06,123
(I can't argue. It's better to count this way.)

1061
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:07,658
- 25, 26, 27, 28... - 25, 26, 27, 28...

1062
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,761
(He's counting a lot better than he did before.)

1063
00:40:11,562 --> 00:40:13,330
I was right. It has 45 letters in Korean.

1064
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,765
So tell me. Which way was easier to count?

1065
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:16,367
My way was easier.

1066
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,035
(He's being stubborn.)

1067
00:40:18,035 --> 00:40:19,470
- The first method? - There were four...

1068
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,239
(The first method? Are you serious?)

1069
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,641
Jong Kook, we're in New Zealand.

1070
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,309
- We're in New Zealand. - Be reasonable. Which is easier?

1071
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:26,644
(Se Chan, which way is easier?)

1072
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:28,679
- Your method is way easier. - Right?

1073
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,780
(He didn't even hesitate to answer.)

1074
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:31,348
I have my own way of counting.

1075
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:33,050
Your way of counting is absurd.

1076
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,985
You obviously counted better the second time around.

1077
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:36,554
Haha, your method doesn't matter...

1078
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:38,189
when you're with Jong Kook. You should know that by now.

1079
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,658
- But it's how I count. - No, that doesn't matter.

1080
00:40:40,658 --> 00:40:43,060
How are we going to memorize this? Let's give it a try.

1081
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,062
We each need to memorize 11 letters.

1082
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:47,098
You'll be riding the jet boat in five minutes. Please hurry up.

1083
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:49,033
Then I'll memorize this part.

1084
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,202
"Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauo".

1085
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:52,369
Then I'll do the next part.

1086
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,705
I'll continue on with...

1087
00:40:54,705 --> 00:40:57,174
- "tamateaturipukakapikimaunga". - Just memorize your part.

1088
00:40:57,508 --> 00:40:59,910
- This part is mine. - Yes, memorize that.

1089
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,978
- Don't you think that's... - This part.

1090
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:02,780
(How are they so confident? They're taking too many at once.)

1091
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:07,251
(They start memorizing each of their parts.)

1092
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:14,658
(Jong Kook tries to memorize it by using the most basic tactic.)

1093
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,495
I'm done memorizing my part.

1094
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:22,566
(Se Chan tries to memorize it by adding a rhythm to it.)

1095
00:41:23,267 --> 00:41:25,469
(Dancing)

1096
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:27,972
Come on. Let's go.

1097
00:41:27,972 --> 00:41:29,540
(He tries using a dialogue from "Nameless Gangster".)

1098
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,078
(Haha tries to memorize it by making it into a dialogue.)

1099
00:41:35,012 --> 00:41:37,181
(He memorizes it like a gangster.)

1100
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:41,118
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo, who is very bad at memorizing things,)

1101
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:43,554
(has frozen on the spot.)

1102
00:41:44,288 --> 00:41:45,990
(I'm thoughtless...)

1103
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,226
(because my brain is empty.)

1104
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,995
- Let's give it a try. - I think we got it.

1105
00:41:50,995 --> 00:41:52,496
(They just need to combine what they've each memorized.)

1106
00:41:52,496 --> 00:41:53,597
Let's begin.

1107
00:41:54,532 --> 00:41:56,767
(Dancing)

1108
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:02,873
(Acting like a gangster)

1109
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:09,013
(Jong Kook's very stable.)

1110
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,588
(Interestingly, they all succeeded in memorizing each of their parts.)

1111
00:42:17,588 --> 00:42:18,656
We got it. Okay.

1112
00:42:18,656 --> 00:42:19,890
We got the whole name right.

1113
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:21,492
(Now, they just need to get it right again after they come back.)

1114
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,829
- Everyone, get on the boat. - Let's go.

1115
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:28,799
(Their Chance Card depends on this 10-minute, jet boat ride.)

1116
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:33,304
(He continues to memorize his part out loud.)

1117
00:42:34,338 --> 00:42:35,372
Okay.

1118
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:38,475
(They're trying harder than ever to memorize their parts.)

1119
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,544
Jong Kook, remember this.

1120
00:42:40,978 --> 00:42:43,347
Haha and I will be able to avoid Nevis Swing.

1121
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:46,116
- We need to win this Chance Card. - Yes, of course.

1122
00:42:46,116 --> 00:42:47,952
- I hope we get it right. - Let's get it.

1123
00:42:50,487 --> 00:42:53,991
(They keep memorizing it out loud.)

1124
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,393
(Not only does Se Chan and Haha try their best,)

1125
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:59,129
(but Jong Kook and Ji Hyo also try hard to memorize their parts too.)

1126
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,564
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1127
00:43:00,564 --> 00:43:02,366
(They shout out each of their parts in order not to forget.)

1128
00:43:02,366 --> 00:43:03,934
- Let's go! - We can do it!

1129
00:43:03,934 --> 00:43:05,703
- Nice. - Let's go.

1130
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,304
See you!

1131
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:09,473
(Their mission to memorize the name begins now.)

1132
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,809
Let's get it. Let's get it.

1133
00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:13,043
Let's go.

1134
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,079
You're going to make it big in this episode.

1135
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:17,181
Let's go!

1136
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:19,950
(Warm sunlight and cool breeze)

1137
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,852
Isn't the view beautiful? Just look at it.

1138
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,320
It's so pretty.

1139
00:43:24,488 --> 00:43:25,789
- My gosh. - This is amazing.

1140
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,993
- It's cool, but the sun is hot. - I know.

1141
00:43:28,993 --> 00:43:30,895
- It's really nice. - That's what makes it so nice.

1142
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:33,731
The sun's shining, and there's a cool breeze.

1143
00:43:33,898 --> 00:43:37,201
But I can't stop memorizing my part as I look at this view.

1144
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:39,136
- Okay! - My gosh.

1145
00:43:39,136 --> 00:43:40,304
(The jet boat starts to speed up.)

1146
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:43,774
- Okay. My gosh. - My goodness.

1147
00:43:44,241 --> 00:43:45,910
My gosh, it's really fast.

1148
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:49,013
What is this?

1149
00:43:49,346 --> 00:43:51,448
(The sightseeing's over. The jet boat starts going faster.)

1150
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:52,449
What is this?

1151
00:43:52,449 --> 00:43:53,517
Oh, my gosh!

1152
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:58,956
- This is no joke. - My gosh!

1153
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,060
- Let me look at the scenery! - Gosh, my sunglasses.

1154
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,995
Let me enjoy the view!

1155
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,432
(Screaming)

1156
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:13,470
(They're screaming their lungs out...)

1157
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,639
(with this beautiful scenery in front of them.)

1158
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,508
Let us enjoy the view!

1159
00:44:17,908 --> 00:44:19,944
Let us enjoy the scenery!

1160
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:22,846
(The driver allows them to enjoy the view by making turns.)

1161
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,682
Let us enjoy the nice view!

1162
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,285
(A deep sea creature has appeared in New Zealand.)

1163
00:44:28,285 --> 00:44:29,353
What is this?

1164
00:44:30,287 --> 00:44:31,689
This is not what I expected.

1165
00:44:31,956 --> 00:44:33,090
Give me my anxiety pills!

1166
00:44:33,724 --> 00:44:36,160
- My anxiety pills! - Anxiety pills!

1167
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,062
(This is fun.)

1168
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,698
Jong Kook's really enjoying this right now.

1169
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:45,102
(They experience a thrilling ride in New Zealand.)

1170
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,675
(Just then...)

1171
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:52,910
- What? - He's going to spin?

1172
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,878
- Jong Kook, hold on tight. - This is great.

1173
00:44:54,878 --> 00:44:56,013
He's going to make a spin.

1174
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,215
(He's going to spin the boat in the middle of the lake?)

1175
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:01,151
Hold onto your hats.

1176
00:45:05,856 --> 00:45:08,759
(The boat makes a 540-degree turn without slowing down.)

1177
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,464
(This is what you call a real jet boat ride.)

1178
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:15,599
- Oh, my gosh. - My gosh.

1179
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,468
(This is only the beginning. The jet boat starts going faster.)

1180
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:18,535
Slow down.

1181
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:20,771
Slow down! The engine's going to burst!

1182
00:45:21,338 --> 00:45:23,273
This is going to overheat the engine!

1183
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:25,376
Stop speeding! It's going to overheat the engine!

1184
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,478
- There's a forest in front of us. - No!

1185
00:45:28,178 --> 00:45:30,748
(The jet boat heads straight to the bush.)

1186
00:45:31,348 --> 00:45:34,485
(No! We're going to crash!)

1187
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:35,886
No!

1188
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:37,354
(Stop the jet boat! Stop!)

1189
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:42,826
(The boat passes right by the bush.)

1190
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:45,462
(The driver is very skilled at driving the boat.)

1191
00:45:45,763 --> 00:45:47,431
- No, stop! - Stop this!

1192
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:50,300
(They're already dumbfounded by what just happened.)

1193
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,302
That's a rock over there! That's a rock!

1194
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:54,371
- What? - No, wait. Stop.

1195
00:45:54,371 --> 00:45:55,372
- My gosh. - Where are we going?

1196
00:45:55,372 --> 00:45:58,208
(The pillars aren't very far apart, and there's a pile of rocks.)

1197
00:45:59,643 --> 00:46:02,746
(But the boat isn't slowing down.)

1198
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:05,315
(Watch where you're going!)

1199
00:46:10,487 --> 00:46:13,090
(This is crazy.)

1200
00:46:15,392 --> 00:46:16,560
(Watch out!)

1201
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,961
We're going to crash!

1202
00:46:18,062 --> 00:46:19,163
We're going to crash!

1203
00:46:19,696 --> 00:46:21,698
- This is practically a punishment. - My gosh.

1204
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,934
(It was a shocking and horrific jet boat ride.)

1205
00:46:23,934 --> 00:46:25,936
This was unbelievable.

1206
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:27,738
Please...

1207
00:46:27,738 --> 00:46:31,308
(But what were we supposed to memorize again?)

1208
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:33,444
What was the name? I forgot everything.

1209
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,312
I can't think properly.

1210
00:46:35,746 --> 00:46:37,548
- I can't remember. - You need to!

1211
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:39,149
(It's as if they reset their brains.)

1212
00:46:39,817 --> 00:46:40,951
I forgot everything.

1213
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:42,619
What was it?

1214
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:44,955
(Thanks to the crazy jet boat ride, they forgot the name of the place.)

1215
00:46:45,756 --> 00:46:46,924
Jong Kook, do you remember?

1216
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,325
- It was... - I can't remember anything.

1217
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:49,860
- We can't forget. - My gosh.

1218
00:46:50,494 --> 00:46:52,229
- I can't remember anything! - My goodness.

1219
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:55,032
(The last bit of memory that was left escapes from their minds.)

1220
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:56,934
(When is this going to end?)

1221
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:58,702
- Stop that! - No!

1222
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,774
(She bursts into tears.)

1223
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:05,809
You must remember it!

1224
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:09,079
- I can't ride Nevis Swing tomorrow. - We must win the Chance Card.

1225
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,115
We need that Chance Card! Please!

1226
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:16,353
- Okay. We're here. - That was some good driving.

1227
00:47:16,386 --> 00:47:18,088
It was so scary.

1228
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:19,289
(People do this for fun?)

1229
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:20,491
Thank you.

1230
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:22,159
(Their boat ride is over.)

1231
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,261
Everyone, did you enjoy your boat ride?

1232
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,296
- Sure. - Hold on. Hang on a second.

1233
00:47:26,296 --> 00:47:27,764
- Wait. - Give me a minute.

1234
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,466
- Wait. - Hold on.

1235
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:30,801
Wait.

1236
00:47:30,801 --> 00:47:32,236
(For some reason, everyone seems uneasy.)

1237
00:47:32,236 --> 00:47:33,871
- It starts with "Tau". - It does, right?

1238
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:36,006
Okay. Let's do this. Let's give it a go!

1239
00:47:36,006 --> 00:47:37,107
(They pretend to be confident.)

1240
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:38,842
That's a really good Chance Card, right?

1241
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,677
- This is a great one. - Okay.

1242
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:42,212
- This won't disappoint you. - Okay.

1243
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:44,148
- Hey, are you ready? - Not yet.

1244
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:45,816
- You can do it, right? Shall we? - Let's try it.

1245
00:47:45,816 --> 00:47:47,417
- Let's give it a try. - Can you do it? Okay.

1246
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:49,386
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's get it.

1247
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:50,621
Challenge!

1248
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,622
(Their fate depends on this.)

1249
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:52,656
Let's get it.

1250
00:47:53,557 --> 00:47:55,893
Taumatawhakatangi...

1251
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,763
hangakoauauo.

1252
00:48:00,397 --> 00:48:02,599
- He got it right. - I speak with an accent.

1253
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,535
Don't count my interjections.

1254
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,872
- Hey. - Don't count it. This isn't it.

1255
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,007
We won't count that.

1256
00:48:10,007 --> 00:48:12,342
Tamatea...

1257
00:48:12,676 --> 00:48:14,811
- You know? - "You know?"

1258
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:17,881
- Turipukaka - You did it.

1259
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:19,616
- You know? - You're doing fine.

1260
00:48:20,551 --> 00:48:22,186
- You know? - "You know?"

1261
00:48:24,688 --> 00:48:28,158
(Haha memorized his part with a method from his hometown.)

1262
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:30,460
(As soon as he rode the boat, his mind went blank.)

1263
00:48:30,894 --> 00:48:33,597
- I can't remember mine. - Don't forget your part.

1264
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:36,233
- Auauo. - I cannot remember my part!

1265
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:40,370
(I trust you, my hero.)

1266
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,806
(If they can't win the Chance Card here,)

1267
00:48:42,806 --> 00:48:45,475
(they will have to ride Nevis Swing tomorrow.)

1268
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:48,111
(Was Haha's method good enough to beat the thrill of the boat ride?)

1269
00:48:50,247 --> 00:48:53,483
- Pikima. - Don't count, "you know."

1270
00:48:54,117 --> 00:48:55,752
- That was good. - Is it my turn?

1271
00:48:56,086 --> 00:49:01,792
Ungahoronuku...

1272
00:49:03,827 --> 00:49:05,929
Pokaiwhenu.

1273
00:49:05,929 --> 00:49:07,130
(Jong Kook remembers his as well.)

1274
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:09,466
- Is it my turn? - This is great.

1275
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:10,567
(Only six syllables remain.)

1276
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,537
Aki...

1277
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,841
(Please remember it, Ji Hyo!)

1278
00:49:18,809 --> 00:49:22,713
Akitanatahu.

1279
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:24,081
That's correct!

1280
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,283
(Team New Zealand successfully accomplishes their mission.)

1281
00:49:26,283 --> 00:49:28,118
- Yes! - We did it.

1282
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:31,188
- I didn't think it was possible. - Oh, my. No way.

1283
00:49:31,188 --> 00:49:32,623
(It's time to choose a Chance Card.)

1284
00:49:32,623 --> 00:49:34,424
- You accomplished your mission. - Yes.

1285
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,727
- There's a great Chance Card. - Okay.

1286
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,196
- They are the ones we chose. - Look through the cards,

1287
00:49:39,263 --> 00:49:40,631
and choose 1 of the 3.

1288
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:43,200
(They choose 1 of the 3 cards.)

1289
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,868
(They will choose the card and decide to use it or not.)

1290
00:49:44,868 --> 00:49:46,236
"We won't do it."

1291
00:49:46,236 --> 00:49:48,705
Negative statements might give us positive outcomes.

1292
00:49:48,705 --> 00:49:50,540
- I agree. I thought so too. - Think about this one too.

1293
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:53,210
Why are there 2 lines? What could these 2 lines mean?

1294
00:49:53,243 --> 00:49:54,811
Is it, "We won't do the penalty"?

1295
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:56,813
But there are two lines.

1296
00:49:57,014 --> 00:49:58,081
This must be long.

1297
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:00,784
- Hold on, Haha. - Why are there two lines?

1298
00:50:00,784 --> 00:50:02,753
- They actually might be good. - I don't know.

1299
00:50:03,387 --> 00:50:04,388
Why are there two lines here?

1300
00:50:04,388 --> 00:50:05,622
(This is driving us crazy.)

1301
00:50:05,622 --> 00:50:07,291
We don't know why there are two lines.

1302
00:50:08,558 --> 00:50:11,762
(He has 0 interest as to why there are 2 lines.)

1303
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,097
- Haha, let's make this simple. - My goodness.

1304
00:50:14,097 --> 00:50:16,867
Gosh, didn't he sound so weird just now?

1305
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,302
I asked why there were two lines.

1306
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:20,337
He said, "I don't know."

1307
00:50:22,472 --> 00:50:26,076
(I don't care if there are lines or not. It's your penalty anyway.)

1308
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:28,945
How could you say that?

1309
00:50:28,945 --> 00:50:30,447
- But I was telling you the truth. - Seriously.

1310
00:50:30,447 --> 00:50:32,316
- Hold on. - Right. The lines are covered.

1311
00:50:32,316 --> 00:50:34,117
I've never seen someone answer my question like that.

1312
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,887
- Since I'm not doing the penalty, - "I don't know."

1313
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:39,389
- I can't get into this. - He can't guess it.

1314
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:41,491
What if they did this on purpose? You didn't, right?

1315
00:50:41,491 --> 00:50:43,560
(Anyway, they are very nervous about the two lines.)

1316
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:47,297
Which one would you want? We can't make the decision for you.

1317
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:49,066
Haha, let's go with "We won't do it."

1318
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,702
- "We won't do it." - "We won't do it."

1319
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:54,304
- This is the simplest out of all. - Okay. Go with that one.

1320
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:55,939
(Haha and Se Chan choose the simplest one.)

1321
00:50:57,374 --> 00:50:59,142
If you are going to use the Chance Card,

1322
00:51:00,077 --> 00:51:02,579
peel off the tape. If you don't want to use it,

1323
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:04,514
destroy it.

1324
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:06,516
- You guys are so cruel. - But...

1325
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:08,585
(Will they choose to use the Chance Card or not?)

1326
00:51:08,585 --> 00:51:10,487
Hey, whatever happens, we should go for it.

1327
00:51:10,487 --> 00:51:13,256
- Shouldn't we use... - A great card is 1 of the 3.

1328
00:51:13,256 --> 00:51:15,192
- Let's use this card. - We have a great card?

1329
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,894
You do have to use the card. Think about it, guys.

1330
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:20,063
We even played the game in order to win the card.

1331
00:51:20,063 --> 00:51:21,698
Destroying this doesn't make sense.

1332
00:51:21,698 --> 00:51:23,200
They just said a great card is among them.

1333
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:24,935
- Let's peel it off. - Okay.

1334
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:26,236
(Their final decision is to use the card.)

1335
00:51:26,236 --> 00:51:27,371
Peel it off. Do it.

1336
00:51:28,538 --> 00:51:30,307
(What is the Chance Card Team New Zealand chose?)

1337
00:51:30,307 --> 00:51:32,309
- What is it? - 1, 2, 3.

1338
00:51:32,309 --> 00:51:33,810
- "All..." - "All"?

1339
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,145
"All of us won't do it"?

1340
00:51:35,145 --> 00:51:37,948
- It's "all of us". - "All of us won't do it"?

1341
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:39,683
- It's "All of us won't do it." - All right.

1342
00:51:39,683 --> 00:51:41,017
"All of us..."

1343
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:44,054
- "All of us..." "Nevis Swing..." - "Nevis Swing..."

1344
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,691
- "Penalty"? What is this? - Wait, hey.

1345
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:49,826
(All of them will do the penalty?)

1346
00:51:49,826 --> 00:51:51,027
- "Penalty". - "Penalty".

1347
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:54,064
- "Complain..." - "Complain..."

1348
00:51:54,064 --> 00:51:58,068
(All of us won't complain about the penalty.)

1349
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:01,238
My gosh, you guys are so annoying.

1350
00:52:01,238 --> 00:52:02,706
(They picked, "All of us won't complain about the penalty.")

1351
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:04,608
- Does it mean all of us will do it? - Wait.

1352
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:06,476
Hold on. How is this...

1353
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:08,412
- How can this be a chance for us? - How is it a chance for us?

1354
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:11,515
I told you it's a mixed set. A good one was among the cards.

1355
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:14,684
- We won't complain about it? - What should we do?

1356
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:17,387
- We can refute this. - It says, "all of us" here.

1357
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,823
Does it imply that we are facing the penalty too?

1358
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,158
All of you will face the penalty.

1359
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:23,860
(The entire Team New Zealand will face the penalty.)

1360
00:52:25,128 --> 00:52:28,698
All of you will face the penalty, and you won't complain about it.

1361
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:30,300
That means all of us are doing it together.

1362
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,401
Yes.

1363
00:52:31,968 --> 00:52:33,403
We're going to join them too?

1364
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:34,871
Yes.

1365
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:40,043
(Their penalty has become his penalty in an instant.)

1366
00:52:41,978 --> 00:52:44,281
I bet one of the cards will say, "The members..."

1367
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,216
"won't face the penalty."

1368
00:52:46,216 --> 00:52:48,285
This feels...

1369
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:52,389
nice. I don't like the penalty, but I feel good about it.

1370
00:52:52,389 --> 00:52:53,623
(He loves dragging people down.)

1371
00:52:54,891 --> 00:52:56,126
But I...

1372
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:59,696
But I came here to support you.

1373
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:02,132
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo came to support but have become victims.)

1374
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:04,067
(We're sorry, Ji Hyo.)

1375
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:06,136
You're happy, right? You're okay with this, right?

1376
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,538
I didn't plan on this.

1377
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:11,007
- Let's get it! - Poor Ji Hyo.

1378
00:53:11,007 --> 00:53:12,075
(Chance Cards can be scary.)

1379
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,178
All right. We figured that you might be hungry.

1380
00:53:15,178 --> 00:53:16,780
- We ordered some food for you. - Okay.

1381
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:20,450
My gosh, look at the owner. He has the reggae look.

1382
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:23,019
- Hello. - Hi.

1383
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,855
- That looks really good. - I respect you.

1384
00:53:24,888 --> 00:53:27,224
(He has a presence.)

1385
00:53:28,391 --> 00:53:29,993
My gosh, that looks really good.

1386
00:53:29,993 --> 00:53:32,362
(It's a barbecue dish with mashed potatoes.)

1387
00:53:33,597 --> 00:53:36,399
(It's a roasted blue cod dish of New Zealand.)

1388
00:53:37,868 --> 00:53:40,036
(And there are more!)

1389
00:53:40,036 --> 00:53:43,206
- My goodness. - Gosh.

1390
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:45,642
- Are we really eating this? - Thank you.

1391
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:49,613
(It's a platter of fruits and vegetables with venison and ham.)

1392
00:53:50,547 --> 00:53:52,182
This is the best.

1393
00:53:52,182 --> 00:53:53,250
(Chicken salad with Manuka honey)

1394
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:55,585
(Delicious)

1395
00:53:57,287 --> 00:53:59,623
(As soon as he has a bite,)

1396
00:53:59,623 --> 00:54:01,057
(he's mesmerized.)

1397
00:54:01,057 --> 00:54:03,393
- This is amazing. - Try this. Let me cut it for you.

1398
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,996
Admire the scenery in the back while you eat.

1399
00:54:06,897 --> 00:54:08,965
Say that this costs 20 dollars,

1400
00:54:08,965 --> 00:54:11,034
but with the view, it's 40 dollars.

1401
00:54:13,537 --> 00:54:14,738
Is it crispy?

1402
00:54:14,738 --> 00:54:15,805
- How is it? - Or is it tender?

1403
00:54:15,805 --> 00:54:17,974
(They enjoy the meal with a picturesque view.)

1404
00:54:17,974 --> 00:54:20,610
The weather is great here,

1405
00:54:20,744 --> 00:54:23,480
but I wonder what Team Australia is...

1406
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:25,916
- doing? - Doing?

1407
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,784
(What is Team Australia up to?)

1408
00:54:27,784 --> 00:54:30,921
(Meanwhile, Team Australia...)

1409
00:54:31,288 --> 00:54:33,990
You accomplished your mission.

1410
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,191
- Yes. - We did.

1411
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:36,826
Let me check the items one more time.

1412
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:40,330
Here's the crocodile paw key chain.

1413
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:42,465
- Is this the key chain? - Yes, it is.

1414
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:44,100
- It's the crocodile paw. - Yes.

1415
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,635
Okay. It's the key chain, right?

1416
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:47,304
- It's the kangaroo paw key chain. - It's the kangaroo key chain.

1417
00:54:47,304 --> 00:54:49,306
A key chain? A kangaroo paw key chain?

1418
00:54:49,306 --> 00:54:51,007
- This is interesting. What is it? - How much is it?

1419
00:54:51,308 --> 00:54:52,409
(Kangaroos are the symbol of Australia.)

1420
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:54,244
All right. I have the kangaroo meat.

1421
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:56,446
- Yes, yes. It's a kangaroo steak. - Is that kangaroo meat?

1422
00:54:56,446 --> 00:54:58,481
- Okay. This is it. - We got it.

1423
00:54:58,748 --> 00:55:00,216
This looks like liver.

1424
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:02,285
Since the skin was too expensive, I took a picture.

1425
00:55:02,285 --> 00:55:03,920
I can't buy it. It's too expensive.

1426
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,189
This is about 1,200 Australian dollars.

1427
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:09,793
- A golden wattle. - I also have this in photos too.

1428
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,361
Let me pick it up.

1429
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:13,930
Well, I got them. They do smell like acacia.

1430
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:16,099
You may choose...

1431
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:19,235
- 1 of the 3 cards now. - Really?

1432
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:21,538
(It's time to choose one of the cards.)

1433
00:55:21,538 --> 00:55:23,139
These are the cards you chose.

1434
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:25,508
You have "We won't go," "We'll go," and "We will do it."

1435
00:55:25,508 --> 00:55:28,878
(The current status of Chance Cards Team Australia has)

1436
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:31,681
I want to go to our hotel and home.

1437
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:33,283
- Choose "We'll go." - I agree.

1438
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:35,218
- What do you think? - I don't feel good about it.

1439
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:36,353
"We'll go home."

1440
00:55:36,353 --> 00:55:38,221
- You chose your card now. - Yes.

1441
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:40,390
If it's "We'll go home," we're going home right away, right?

1442
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,760
It's up to you to either use the card or not.

1443
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,030
(There's one more decision left. Will they use it or not?)

1444
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:49,699
I already informed you. It's a mix of advantages and disadvantages.

1445
00:55:49,699 --> 00:55:50,700
- Okay. - Let's do it.

1446
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,303
If you decide not to use it, you can just read the card.

1447
00:55:53,303 --> 00:55:56,106
If you decide to use the card, you'll comply with the card.

1448
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:57,374
- Let's do this. - We ought to.

1449
00:55:57,374 --> 00:55:58,642
We earned this Chance Card.

1450
00:55:58,642 --> 00:56:00,076
- We fly into the face of danger. - Right.

1451
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:01,411
- Let's jump into it. So Min. - We'll use it.

1452
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:03,179
- You'll peel it off. - Okay.

1453
00:56:03,413 --> 00:56:05,148
- Let's go. - We will go home.

1454
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:09,886
(They are certain they will be heading home.)

1455
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:11,721
- We're going home. - Let's do this.

1456
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:15,158
(This Chance Card has to do with the final penalty tomorrow.)

1457
00:56:15,158 --> 00:56:19,462
(Will this be their lucky chance to avoid these vicious crocodiles?)

1458
00:56:26,603 --> 00:56:29,773
(They are certain they will be heading home.)

1459
00:56:30,373 --> 00:56:31,608
- We're going home. - Let's do this.

1460
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:35,045
(This Chance Card has to do with the final penalty tomorrow.)

1461
00:56:35,045 --> 00:56:39,349
(Will this be their lucky chance to avoid these vicious crocodiles?)

1462
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:40,950
- "One more member..." - "One more..."

1463
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,254
(One more member is going to be penalized.)

1464
00:56:44,988 --> 00:56:48,258
(One more member is going to be penalized.)

1465
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:52,162
I told you.

1466
00:56:52,162 --> 00:56:54,130
- It doesn't affect us. - Gosh.

1467
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,532
(They'll be penalized anyway.)

1468
00:56:55,532 --> 00:56:56,566
All right.

1469
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,168
- Well... - We're...

1470
00:56:58,168 --> 00:56:59,269
It's bad for me, right?

1471
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:03,339
One more member is going to be penalized.

1472
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:05,275
Let's decide tomorrow...

1473
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,644
who will be penalized.

1474
00:57:07,644 --> 00:57:11,214
There was no way it'd be "We're going home."

1475
00:57:11,514 --> 00:57:12,649
You said...

1476
00:57:12,916 --> 00:57:15,885
- It's a four-day trip. - What?

1477
00:57:15,952 --> 00:57:18,354
It won't do anything to you.

1478
00:57:18,354 --> 00:57:21,591
I knew it'd be a bad one.

1479
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:22,592
It's no big deal.

1480
00:57:22,592 --> 00:57:25,895
They're two guys. A girl would be better.

1481
00:57:25,895 --> 00:57:26,896
(Now, you treat me like a girl?)

1482
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:30,133
To be honest,

1483
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:32,235
for Seok Jin, this might be the last chance.

1484
00:57:32,235 --> 00:57:34,170
(This might be your last chance.)

1485
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,706
I don't mean anything bad.

1486
00:57:37,006 --> 00:57:39,509
So Min would have more chances...

1487
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:42,278
- than you. - That's funny.

1488
00:57:42,512 --> 00:57:44,047
Let's decide tomorrow.

1489
00:57:44,047 --> 00:57:46,149
You're done for today.

1490
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,051
- Really? - As you worked hard,

1491
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,153
we prepared a special Australian meal.

1492
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:51,154
Really?

1493
00:57:51,154 --> 00:57:52,856
- Let's go eat. - Let's go.

1494
00:57:52,856 --> 00:57:54,424
(They're going to try a special Australian meal.)

1495
00:57:55,925 --> 00:57:57,460
It's a steakhouse.

1496
00:57:58,294 --> 00:57:59,362
It smells good.

1497
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,164
It smells like steak.

1498
00:58:01,798 --> 00:58:05,502
We thought you'd be hungry, so we ordered for you.

1499
00:58:05,502 --> 00:58:06,636
Thank you.

1500
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,471
Thank you.

1501
00:58:09,939 --> 00:58:12,342
- Thank you. Let's share it. - Thank you.

1502
00:58:12,342 --> 00:58:15,812
- Thank you. - It looks tasty.

1503
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:17,413
(They're happy to see food.)

1504
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,082
The white one is crocodile steak.

1505
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,885
(The white one is crocodile steak.)

1506
00:58:21,885 --> 00:58:22,852
What?

1507
00:58:22,852 --> 00:58:24,754
(The white one is crocodile steak.)

1508
00:58:24,754 --> 00:58:26,756
(Shocked)

1509
00:58:26,756 --> 00:58:28,558
(Crocodile steak?)

1510
00:58:30,293 --> 00:58:33,863
The white one is crocodile steak. The other one is kangaroo meat.

1511
00:58:34,697 --> 00:58:36,266
(Appetizing)

1512
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:40,403
This is driving me crazy.

1513
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:42,138
Why did you order this?

1514
00:58:42,338 --> 00:58:43,873
So Min, try the kangaroo.

1515
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:45,341
It tastes good.

1516
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:46,743
Let me try.

1517
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:49,179
(I'll have a taste.)

1518
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:50,880
This is crocodile.

1519
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:53,183
- How does it taste? - Gosh.

1520
00:58:53,817 --> 00:58:55,952
- It tastes good. - It does.

1521
00:58:56,052 --> 00:58:57,854
It's a bit denser.

1522
00:58:57,854 --> 00:58:58,855
It tastes like kangaroos.

1523
00:58:58,855 --> 00:59:02,125
(It tastes like kangaroos.)

1524
00:59:02,125 --> 00:59:03,793
- What does that mean? - For example,

1525
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:06,529
Jong Kook's flesh looks very hard, right?

1526
00:59:06,529 --> 00:59:08,531
I told you.

1527
00:59:08,531 --> 00:59:10,366
- Is it like liver? - No.

1528
00:59:10,533 --> 00:59:12,435
It's a bit denser.

1529
00:59:12,435 --> 00:59:14,737
You feel the kangaroo's muscles.

1530
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,440
I've tried crocodile steak.

1531
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,609
If you ignore the fact that it's crocodile,

1532
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:21,144
- Does it taste good? - it tastes like fish.

1533
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:22,712
Which part is it?

1534
00:59:22,712 --> 00:59:24,280
- It smells good. - Really?

1535
00:59:24,547 --> 00:59:26,049
Let me try.

1536
00:59:26,149 --> 00:59:27,283
Which part is it?

1537
00:59:27,917 --> 00:59:29,686
- I don't know. - How does it taste?

1538
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:31,087
This is kangaroo meat?

1539
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,323
It's a bit sour.

1540
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,624
(Crocodile is a bit sour.)

1541
00:59:34,624 --> 00:59:36,125
It's sour?

1542
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,393
Yes.

1543
00:59:38,127 --> 00:59:39,295
Is it close to fish or meat?

1544
00:59:39,462 --> 00:59:41,331
It's right in the middle.

1545
00:59:41,698 --> 00:59:44,000
If you forget that it's crocodile, it tastes good.

1546
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:46,102
But I can't stop thinking about crocodiles.

1547
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:49,772
(He can't stop thinking about crocodiles.)

1548
00:59:51,074 --> 00:59:53,910
I'm craving kimchijjigae.

1549
00:59:54,377 --> 00:59:55,545
Are you okay?

1550
00:59:55,545 --> 00:59:58,314
He's sweating.

1551
00:59:59,215 --> 01:00:01,584
- He's wearing winter clothes. - I'm just hot.

1552
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:04,053
(It's not a cold sweat.)

1553
01:00:04,754 --> 01:00:06,256
So Min, I'm hot.

1554
01:00:06,256 --> 01:00:08,057
It's a thick sweater.

1555
01:00:08,591 --> 01:00:12,128
If you look up the Sydney weather on the internet,

1556
01:00:12,295 --> 01:00:15,365
it says the highs are around 23 to 24°C.

1557
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,233
It's cold at night.

1558
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:19,269
I'm an expert when it comes to this country.

1559
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:22,005
- I've been here five times. - Really?

1560
01:00:22,005 --> 01:00:26,175
I shot my first commercial in Australia.

1561
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:27,577
What commercial?

1562
01:00:27,877 --> 01:00:30,546
A beer commercial.

1563
01:00:30,813 --> 01:00:32,982
- You shot a beer commercial? - Yes.

1564
01:00:32,982 --> 01:00:34,384
You don't drink at all.

1565
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:38,254
(You don't drink at all.)

1566
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:40,123
A beer would knock you down.

1567
01:00:40,123 --> 01:00:42,191
- How did you shoot a commercial? - Be quiet.

1568
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:44,861
I wasn't famous back then. It was shot abroad.

1569
01:00:44,861 --> 01:00:45,862
What?

1570
01:00:45,862 --> 01:00:47,997
We shot for three days.

1571
01:00:48,131 --> 01:00:50,533
Was it like the beer commercials we know?

1572
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:51,834
No, it wasn't.

1573
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:54,837
He was just swept away in the foam.

1574
01:00:54,837 --> 01:00:57,273
- Exactly. - He was swept away.

1575
01:00:57,273 --> 01:00:59,842
- So you were the foam. - Yes.

1576
01:00:59,842 --> 01:01:01,778
- You played the foam. - He did.

1577
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:03,212
(Jae Seok in his early days)

1578
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:06,816
(He threw himself...)

1579
01:01:06,816 --> 01:01:11,321
(into the beer.)

1580
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:16,459
(He gave his all for his first commercial.)

1581
01:01:18,695 --> 01:01:21,698
Anyway, I shot my first commercial in Australia.

1582
01:01:21,864 --> 01:01:23,866
Australia is special to me.

1583
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,937
You can go to the hotel now.

1584
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:29,505
Do we get to decide tomorrow?

1585
01:01:29,872 --> 01:01:30,873
Sorry?

1586
01:01:30,873 --> 01:01:33,543
Do we get to decide which of the two will be penalized?

1587
01:01:33,543 --> 01:01:36,546
I'll think about it.

1588
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:40,550
By the way, we managed to book only two times.

1589
01:01:40,883 --> 01:01:44,220
One of you will have to go alone.

1590
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,992
(One of you will have to go alone.)

1591
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:52,395
- Two will go together. - Alone?

1592
01:01:52,395 --> 01:01:53,896
(What?)

1593
01:01:53,896 --> 01:01:58,735
(I can't believe it.)

1594
01:01:58,735 --> 01:02:00,737
Isn't it already decided who will go alone?

1595
01:02:00,737 --> 01:02:01,738
Kwang Soo.

1596
01:02:01,738 --> 01:02:04,440
(Isn't it already decided who will go alone?)

1597
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,776
I might prick you with this fork.

1598
01:02:06,776 --> 01:02:08,144
Anyway...

1599
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:09,278
(They don't know who will go alone yet.)

1600
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:11,781
All right. To Kwang Soo.

1601
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,316
- Cheers. - No. Let's see.

1602
01:02:13,316 --> 01:02:14,917
(They comfort Kwang Soo.)

1603
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:19,722
(The sun sets.)

1604
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:24,293
Who will be going?

1605
01:02:25,128 --> 01:02:26,162
- Hello. - Hello.

1606
01:02:26,162 --> 01:02:27,764
- What are you doing? - Hi.

1607
01:02:27,764 --> 01:02:29,732
- What are you doing? - I just took a shower.

1608
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:33,236
By the way, tomorrow,

1609
01:02:33,236 --> 01:02:35,405
you should be penalized for me.

1610
01:02:35,405 --> 01:02:36,672
I can't...

1611
01:02:36,873 --> 01:02:39,942
I'm sorry. I'm going to bed. Hello?

1612
01:02:39,942 --> 01:02:42,045
- Hey. - Hello?

1613
01:02:42,045 --> 01:02:44,380
Hey! What are you doing?

1614
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:49,085
Unbelievable. She hung up on me.

1615
01:02:49,085 --> 01:02:50,453
(Age doesn't matter when it comes to penalties.)

1616
01:02:53,923 --> 01:02:57,493
(The penalty day is here.)

1617
01:02:57,493 --> 01:03:01,397
- Well... - Finally, it's today.

1618
01:03:01,397 --> 01:03:02,465
(The big day is here.)

1619
01:03:02,465 --> 01:03:04,267
Here we are once again.

1620
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:08,504
We went to check the place this morning.

1621
01:03:08,805 --> 01:03:09,872
You won't be disappointed.

1622
01:03:09,872 --> 01:03:11,941
(You won't be disappointed.)

1623
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:14,744
Were the crocodiles doing well?

1624
01:03:15,378 --> 01:03:17,847
- If they're tired... - Right.

1625
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,149
- It's important. - Look.

1626
01:03:20,149 --> 01:03:21,884
It's off-season.

1627
01:03:21,918 --> 01:03:25,088
They'll be having visitors after a long time.

1628
01:03:25,088 --> 01:03:26,322
They'd be so excited.

1629
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:29,625
They'd be so excited to finally have visitors.

1630
01:03:29,625 --> 01:03:31,127
They might even playfully bite you.

1631
01:03:31,127 --> 01:03:32,728
What?

1632
01:03:33,196 --> 01:03:34,363
Gosh.

1633
01:03:34,697 --> 01:03:37,633
You'll experience Cage of Death soon.

1634
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:38,901
Before we meet the crocodiles,

1635
01:03:38,901 --> 01:03:41,571
let's get back to the Chance Card.

1636
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:44,507
Between Seok Jin and So Min,

1637
01:03:44,507 --> 01:03:46,542
let's decide who will be penalized.

1638
01:03:46,776 --> 01:03:50,480
There are two cars outside.

1639
01:03:50,546 --> 01:03:53,950
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will choose between the two cars...

1640
01:03:53,983 --> 01:03:56,219
and get in the same one together.

1641
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:59,222
Seok Jin and So Min will choose separate cars.

1642
01:03:59,222 --> 01:04:00,857
The one who chooses...

1643
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,593
the car where Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are in...

1644
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:06,896
- will be penalized. - So we should try to choose...

1645
01:04:06,896 --> 01:04:07,964
the car that's empty.

1646
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:09,532
Whoever comes, I'll be so happy to see them.

1647
01:04:09,532 --> 01:04:11,134
My heart is pounding.

1648
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:13,236
My day depends on this decision.

1649
01:04:13,236 --> 01:04:15,805
Please ask the drivers to set off as soon as they get in.

1650
01:04:16,105 --> 01:04:19,041
And one of us has to be penalized alone.

1651
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:23,913
(One of us has to be penalized alone.)

1652
01:04:23,913 --> 01:04:25,014
What?

1653
01:04:25,314 --> 01:04:28,050
- Yes. - It's Kwang Soo.

1654
01:04:28,384 --> 01:04:30,486
Please decide who will go alone.

1655
01:04:30,486 --> 01:04:33,022
We have something prepared.

1656
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:34,390
By the way,

1657
01:04:34,857 --> 01:04:38,394
there's this biggest, most ferocious crocodile.

1658
01:04:38,394 --> 01:04:41,197
(The biggest, most ferocious crocodile)

1659
01:04:41,197 --> 01:04:43,332
It's called Chopper.

1660
01:04:43,332 --> 01:04:47,803
It lost both of its front legs in the wild.

1661
01:04:47,803 --> 01:04:49,539
(It lost both of its front legs in the wild.)

1662
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:55,011
(The crocodile lost its front legs in the wild.)

1663
01:04:55,011 --> 01:04:57,380
(The hidden card of Cage of Death)

1664
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:05,254
(It's 5.5m long and weighs 790kg.)

1665
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:09,058
Like in "Inside Men"?

1666
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:10,660
Exactly.

1667
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:12,061
"Inside Men"?

1668
01:05:12,395 --> 01:05:14,530
It must be a crocodile version...

1669
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,265
of Lee Byung Hun.

1670
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:19,435
(Do you know what life without arms is like?)

1671
01:05:20,203 --> 01:05:22,505
Should Kwang Soo and I choose a car?

1672
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:24,106
- Yes, please. - Okay.

1673
01:05:24,106 --> 01:05:25,608
Seok Jin and So Min, please turn around.

1674
01:05:25,608 --> 01:05:26,809
Don't look.

1675
01:05:27,443 --> 01:05:28,477
We won't.

1676
01:05:29,145 --> 01:05:31,747
Our whole day depends on this.

1677
01:05:31,948 --> 01:05:35,952
Our day depends on this decision.

1678
01:05:36,419 --> 01:05:38,721
- Which one should we choose? - Are those our cars?

1679
01:05:38,721 --> 01:05:40,957
Yes. This is van number two.

1680
01:05:41,524 --> 01:05:43,459
- Honestly... - It's better...

1681
01:05:44,293 --> 01:05:45,795
It's better for...

1682
01:05:46,062 --> 01:05:47,830
Seok Jin to do it.

1683
01:05:47,964 --> 01:05:49,565
- So Min already... - He should just do it.

1684
01:05:49,565 --> 01:05:51,400
- went to Indonesia with you. - Yes.

1685
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,469
- He might as well. - Seok Jin is so cunning...

1686
01:05:53,469 --> 01:05:55,037
- more than anything. - I agree.

1687
01:05:55,071 --> 01:05:57,273
We have to make him do it.

1688
01:05:57,273 --> 01:05:59,008
(Will their wish come true?)

1689
01:05:59,008 --> 01:06:00,009
Everyone.

1690
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:02,111
They made their decision.

1691
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,146
- Did they? - To be fair,

1692
01:06:04,146 --> 01:06:06,649
I'll write a number on the sketchbooks.

1693
01:06:07,149 --> 01:06:08,484
I'll put them down.

1694
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:10,453
I want the squirrels.

1695
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,521
- I'll take it. - I will.

1696
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:14,190
(She chooses the squirrels.)

1697
01:06:14,190 --> 01:06:15,691
- I'll take it. - I will.

1698
01:06:15,691 --> 01:06:18,394
- I want the squirrels. - No.

1699
01:06:18,394 --> 01:06:20,796
- I have good feelings about them. - No.

1700
01:06:20,796 --> 01:06:21,964
I already decided...

1701
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:23,032
to take the one you choose.

1702
01:06:23,032 --> 01:06:25,301
- I have good feelings about them. - No.

1703
01:06:25,301 --> 01:06:27,103
- I'll take it. - Please reconsider.

1704
01:06:27,103 --> 01:06:29,038
- No way. - This could be the one.

1705
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:31,007
It's number one.

1706
01:06:31,007 --> 01:06:32,742
Okay, I'm number one.

1707
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,176
- I'm number two. - This is good.

1708
01:06:34,277 --> 01:06:36,012
When you open the door,

1709
01:06:36,012 --> 01:06:38,014
if you find Jae Seok and Kwang Soo in the car,

1710
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:40,283
you'll follow them to Cage of Death.

1711
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,986
If not, you'll ride the car alone.

1712
01:06:43,986 --> 01:06:45,721
(One person will get exempted.)

1713
01:06:45,721 --> 01:06:47,523
(Who will join us?)

1714
01:06:48,024 --> 01:06:51,260
- Let's go. - Which one is 1 and 2?

1715
01:06:51,394 --> 01:06:54,196
- Let's crawl - Crocodile.

1716
01:06:54,196 --> 01:06:55,665
This is number two.

1717
01:06:55,698 --> 01:06:57,600
Do you see the camera inside?

1718
01:06:57,833 --> 01:07:01,971
Do you see it? They're filming the backseat.

1719
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:04,407
(The cameraman is filming the backseat.)

1720
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:06,108
I saw it.

1721
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:08,044
After filming us, he turned around.

1722
01:07:08,044 --> 01:07:10,012
There must be people in the backseat.

1723
01:07:10,012 --> 01:07:12,048
- There's a camera in there too. - No.

1724
01:07:12,048 --> 01:07:13,316
Didn't you see him?

1725
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:16,285
Look, he's filming the backseat.

1726
01:07:18,554 --> 01:07:20,323
Yes, I knew it.

1727
01:07:20,356 --> 01:07:21,924
My hunch is never wrong.

1728
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:25,027
That's amazing. They're filming inside.

1729
01:07:25,795 --> 01:07:28,431
(Hello)

1730
01:07:32,134 --> 01:07:33,302
Wait a minute.

1731
01:07:33,569 --> 01:07:35,604
(Seok Jin will meet the crocodiles.)

1732
01:07:35,604 --> 01:07:37,206
- Wait a minute. - He got caught.

1733
01:07:37,373 --> 01:07:38,841
What's going on?

1734
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:42,078
(She laughs triumphantly.)

1735
01:07:43,045 --> 01:07:44,547
(It's completely empty.)

1736
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:49,285
(She can't stop laughing.)

1737
01:07:50,086 --> 01:07:52,321
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1738
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:54,457
What's going on?

1739
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:55,825
- Let's go. - No.

1740
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:57,693
Put on your seatbelt.

1741
01:07:57,693 --> 01:07:59,295
- Goodness. - Wait.

1742
01:07:59,895 --> 01:08:00,963
Let's go now.

1743
01:08:00,963 --> 01:08:02,531
(Let's go before he runs away.)

1744
01:08:02,531 --> 01:08:04,400
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1745
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,103
- We finally caught him. - We did.

1746
01:08:07,236 --> 01:08:09,805
Why was the cameraman filming the backseat?

1747
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,541
He was fooled.

1748
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:15,277
(She feels relieved.)

1749
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:16,645
That was amazing.

1750
01:08:16,645 --> 01:08:18,114
I had no idea.

1751
01:08:19,582 --> 01:08:21,050
The weather is beautiful.

1752
01:08:21,183 --> 01:08:23,119
It's a perfect day to see the crocodiles.

1753
01:08:24,687 --> 01:08:26,422
It's a perfect day to see the crocodiles.

1754
01:08:26,422 --> 01:08:28,691
(It's a perfect day to see the crocodiles.)

1755
01:08:28,691 --> 01:08:30,359
Because the weather was nice.

1756
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:31,627
Because the weather was bad.

1757
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:38,300
(The weather is beautiful today.)

1758
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,337
(It's perfect to be with crocodiles.)

1759
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:46,842
(She's excited to be exempted.)

1760
01:08:46,842 --> 01:08:48,811
(She's very excited.)

1761
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:50,679
Look at So Min.

1762
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:52,982
She's so cheeky.

1763
01:08:53,182 --> 01:08:55,151
- Gosh. - It's hard to decide who is worse.

1764
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:57,019
I know.

1765
01:08:57,319 --> 01:08:58,854
So Min is really cheeky too.

1766
01:08:59,522 --> 01:09:02,057
Hello, everyone. I'm Jeon So Min.

1767
01:09:02,057 --> 01:09:07,696
We're in Darwin, Australia where crocodiles live.

1768
01:09:07,696 --> 01:09:08,998
Will...

1769
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:12,768
those three members survive today?

1770
01:09:12,935 --> 01:09:14,203
Stay tuned.

1771
01:09:14,236 --> 01:09:15,971
(Stay tuned.)

1772
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:19,375
(Let's go to Cage of Death together.)

1773
01:09:20,443 --> 01:09:22,645
- This must be it. - Where?

1774
01:09:22,778 --> 01:09:23,913
- "Crocodile"? - You're right.

1775
01:09:23,913 --> 01:09:25,014
Is it here?

1776
01:09:27,016 --> 01:09:28,851
(They finally arrive.)

1777
01:09:28,851 --> 01:09:32,521
One of you will go in alone.

1778
01:09:32,521 --> 01:09:37,159
(One of them faces the crocodile alone.)

1779
01:09:37,159 --> 01:09:39,962
You go in alone. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1780
01:09:39,962 --> 01:09:41,697
You don't have to worry...

1781
01:09:41,697 --> 01:09:44,934
because the cage that they had been using...

1782
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:46,202
recently got cracked.

1783
01:09:46,402 --> 01:09:48,103
- How is that possible? - It got cracked?

1784
01:09:48,103 --> 01:09:50,739
They changed it to a new and sturdy one.

1785
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:52,875
(The cage is new.)

1786
01:09:53,409 --> 01:10:00,115
(The old cage looks scary with scratches made by crocodiles.)

1787
01:10:00,483 --> 01:10:01,617
My goodness.

1788
01:10:01,617 --> 01:10:05,754
(With full of fear, they get out of the van.)

1789
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:10,759
(Welcome to Australia.)

1790
01:10:11,293 --> 01:10:12,361
Be careful.

1791
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:15,698
(Their fans congratulate them for meeting the crocodiles.)

1792
01:10:15,998 --> 01:10:19,468
(Prince of Asia came to see the crocodiles!)

1793
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:22,705
(Lucky So Min enters as well.)

1794
01:10:22,705 --> 01:10:23,873
Wait for me.

1795
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,374
Wait for me.

1796
01:10:26,075 --> 01:10:27,176
We're here, So Min.

1797
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:28,844
Be careful.

1798
01:10:28,844 --> 01:10:29,912
Hello.

1799
01:10:29,912 --> 01:10:31,847
(They enter the dark entrance together.)

1800
01:10:31,847 --> 01:10:33,015
Gosh.

1801
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:35,684
- It's like a cave. - What's going on?

1802
01:10:35,684 --> 01:10:37,686
It's dark like a labyrinth.

1803
01:10:37,686 --> 01:10:39,188
You got lucky, So Min.

1804
01:10:39,221 --> 01:10:42,625
We were almost fooled by Kwang Soo's cameraman.

1805
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:44,293
(What awaits the members?)

1806
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:47,329
(They finally come into view.)

1807
01:10:47,329 --> 01:10:54,003
(They're giant crocodiles.)

1808
01:10:54,403 --> 01:10:56,105
- Gosh. - Do we go in there?

1809
01:10:56,105 --> 01:10:58,173
- Look at their tails. - Where?

1810
01:10:58,173 --> 01:10:59,174
Look over here.

1811
01:10:59,174 --> 01:11:00,276
(Are they real?)

1812
01:11:00,276 --> 01:11:01,777
It's a real crocodile tail.

1813
01:11:02,077 --> 01:11:03,846
- It's real. - Is it real?

1814
01:11:04,446 --> 01:11:05,748
- Is it real? - Look.

1815
01:11:06,382 --> 01:11:07,783
It's huge.

1816
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,052
What if we get hit by the tail?

1817
01:11:10,753 --> 01:11:12,922
- What if it's fake? - I can't believe it.

1818
01:11:13,355 --> 01:11:14,523
Isn't it fake?

1819
01:11:14,523 --> 01:11:16,025
(They want to believe that it's fake.)

1820
01:11:16,025 --> 01:11:21,130
(However, the crocodiles above their heads are real.)

1821
01:11:21,697 --> 01:11:24,400
- It's the crocodile I mentioned. - Is that it?

1822
01:11:24,433 --> 01:11:25,901
It's Chopper.

1823
01:11:25,901 --> 01:11:28,904
(His front feet are missing.)

1824
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:30,773
- Look at... - Is it alive?

1825
01:11:30,773 --> 01:11:32,975
the air bubbles rising.

1826
01:11:33,776 --> 01:11:35,377
- This is incredible. - It's alive.

1827
01:11:35,778 --> 01:11:36,946
It's like Lee Byung Hun of crocodiles.

1828
01:11:36,946 --> 01:11:38,847
(They see Chopper right in front of them.)

1829
01:11:39,515 --> 01:11:42,618
(They're speechless.)

1830
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:44,920
Do we go inside there?

1831
01:11:46,322 --> 01:11:51,493
(They will stand next to that gruesome crocodile.)

1832
01:11:51,594 --> 01:11:55,764
(They move to where the cage is.)

1833
01:11:55,764 --> 01:11:57,399
- Look. - It's a baby crocodile.

1834
01:11:57,399 --> 01:11:58,734
It's a baby crocodile.

1835
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:01,637
What if he jumps out of the cage?

1836
01:12:01,637 --> 01:12:02,905
No way.

1837
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:05,574
- You can go inside there to look. - Right.

1838
01:12:05,908 --> 01:12:07,142
Go inside here?

1839
01:12:07,643 --> 01:12:09,011
- Gosh. - That startled me.

1840
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:10,245
It startled me.

1841
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:11,947
(They make eye contact with baby crocodiles.)

1842
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:13,482
You can look at them in the eyes.

1843
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:15,384
(They make eye contact with baby crocodiles.)

1844
01:12:16,352 --> 01:12:17,686
He's doing that again.

1845
01:12:17,686 --> 01:12:19,388
- He has his mouth open. - It's because...

1846
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:22,524
You seem to be in a good mood, So Min.

1847
01:12:23,692 --> 01:12:25,394
She's all smiles.

1848
01:12:25,828 --> 01:12:27,196
- I'm so happy. - I try not to look at her.

1849
01:12:27,196 --> 01:12:29,999
- It's different from Indonesia. - Why?

1850
01:12:29,999 --> 01:12:31,734
It's great. There's so much to see.

1851
01:12:31,734 --> 01:12:34,236
There's a lot to watch.

1852
01:12:34,236 --> 01:12:35,404
What?

1853
01:12:35,404 --> 01:12:37,106
There were more to see in Indonesia.

1854
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:38,407
Are we things to watch?

1855
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:39,642
Goodness.

1856
01:12:39,642 --> 01:12:40,843
(You can do it, guys.)

1857
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,778
(They're fun to watch.)

1858
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:44,880
I'll give you time to look around.

1859
01:12:44,947 --> 01:12:46,115
- What? - Pardon me.

1860
01:12:46,148 --> 01:12:48,050
Do we go in here?

1861
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,686
What's this?

1862
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:53,322
(It makes them freeze.)

1863
01:12:53,322 --> 01:12:56,925
(The pool with crocodiles is deep.)

1864
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:58,527
(Do we go in there?)

1865
01:12:58,527 --> 01:12:59,528
Look at the scratch mark.

1866
01:12:59,528 --> 01:13:01,697
- Do we go in the water? - Yes.

1867
01:13:01,697 --> 01:13:03,132
- Are they scratch marks? - Wait.

1868
01:13:03,132 --> 01:13:06,001
- Look at the scratch marks. - They're scratch marks.

1869
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:09,638
(The new cage is covered with scratches.)

1870
01:13:09,972 --> 01:13:12,441
(These are teeth marks...)

1871
01:13:12,441 --> 01:13:17,913
(made by the crocodiles when they attacked the cage.)

1872
01:13:19,181 --> 01:13:20,983
- Claws? - Excuse me.

1873
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:22,985
(This is insane.)

1874
01:13:23,652 --> 01:13:25,521
Are they paw scratches?

1875
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:26,622
(They're teeth marks.)

1876
01:13:26,622 --> 01:13:28,023
They're teeth marks.

1877
01:13:28,023 --> 01:13:29,224
- Teeth? - Teeth.

1878
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:34,196
(The crocodiles are more violent than expected.)

1879
01:13:34,697 --> 01:13:35,731
Look.

1880
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:37,933
(And they're much bigger.)

1881
01:13:37,933 --> 01:13:39,001
They're huge.

1882
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:40,402
It's like a dinosaur.

1883
01:13:40,602 --> 01:13:42,705
This crocodile is called Axel.

1884
01:13:42,705 --> 01:13:44,740
- It's the second biggest. - Axel?

1885
01:13:44,740 --> 01:13:46,775
(Axel is the second biggest crocodile here.)

1886
01:13:46,775 --> 01:13:49,511
(It's 5.1m long and weighs 900kg.)

1887
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:51,613
Two of you will go in here.

1888
01:13:51,613 --> 01:13:54,383
On the right is Chopper that I mentioned earlier.

1889
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:58,353
(One person goes in the cage near Chopper.)

1890
01:13:58,353 --> 01:14:00,489
This is insane. What should we do?

1891
01:14:00,489 --> 01:14:01,790
That's Chopper.

1892
01:14:02,591 --> 01:14:04,393
It's the one we saw earlier.

1893
01:14:04,393 --> 01:14:05,694
(Chopper is the biggest crocodile here.)

1894
01:14:05,694 --> 01:14:06,962
(He represents gruesomeness and violence.)

1895
01:14:06,962 --> 01:14:11,100
(Who will get lucky and face him alone?)

1896
01:14:11,934 --> 01:14:15,437
We'll decide which one of you will go alone.

1897
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:19,041
The member without a partner will go in the cage alone.

1898
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:21,043
It's the biggest crocodile here.

1899
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:22,945
He lost his front foot in the wild.

1900
01:14:23,112 --> 01:14:24,480
It's 5.5m long.

1901
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,749
It weighs 790kg.

1902
01:14:26,749 --> 01:14:29,184
A troublemaker crocodile awaits.

1903
01:14:29,752 --> 01:14:30,986
Goodness.

1904
01:14:31,854 --> 01:14:33,889
I didn't think it'd be this bad.

1905
01:14:34,022 --> 01:14:36,558
5.5m is longer than a van.

1906
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,895
I can't believe it.

1907
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:42,631
(He can't believe what's going on.)

1908
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:43,932
- Now, - Why am I here?

1909
01:14:43,932 --> 01:14:45,367
your mission is called...

1910
01:14:45,701 --> 01:14:48,604
Cage of Clap. Here are the rules.

1911
01:14:48,604 --> 01:14:50,606
Did you see them?

1912
01:14:50,606 --> 01:14:52,207
Everyone was...

1913
01:14:52,207 --> 01:14:53,642
speechless.

1914
01:14:53,942 --> 01:14:55,844
Then suddenly they listen carefully.

1915
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:58,413
- What's the mission? - Seriously.

1916
01:14:58,413 --> 01:14:59,982
Cage of Clap.

1917
01:14:59,982 --> 01:15:02,751
I don't want to live like them.

1918
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:05,487
(Kwang Soo pays full attention after seeing the crocodile.)

1919
01:15:05,487 --> 01:15:07,890
Three of you will put on eye patches.

1920
01:15:08,123 --> 01:15:10,526
Clap or make sounds to notify where you are.

1921
01:15:10,526 --> 01:15:15,764
The two members to meet first will pair up.

1922
01:15:16,498 --> 01:15:17,633
Goodness.

1923
01:15:17,633 --> 01:15:20,035
- Are you joking? - Are you playing with us?

1924
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:22,004
Rock-paper-scissors is simpler.

1925
01:15:22,004 --> 01:15:24,173
The one without a partner will be sad.

1926
01:15:24,206 --> 01:15:25,274
What is this?

1927
01:15:25,274 --> 01:15:26,475
My goodness.

1928
01:15:26,475 --> 01:15:27,643
(Clapping a lot is key.)

1929
01:15:27,643 --> 01:15:29,211
We have to clap a lot.

1930
01:15:30,646 --> 01:15:31,713
Wait.

1931
01:15:32,214 --> 01:15:34,449
Remember the 337 clap, okay?

1932
01:15:35,083 --> 01:15:38,253
(Follow this sound.)

1933
01:15:38,654 --> 01:15:39,822
Look at them.

1934
01:15:39,822 --> 01:15:41,056
(What do you think about this?)

1935
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:43,425
My gosh, look at them.

1936
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:46,295
I can't believe they're doing that.

1937
01:15:46,295 --> 01:15:47,696
What are you doing?

1938
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:49,865
(Let's remember this sound.)

1939
01:15:49,865 --> 01:15:51,233
- Remember this sound. - Okay, I will.

1940
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:53,769
Are you even human?

1941
01:15:54,102 --> 01:15:56,371
- You're unbelievable. - No, wait.

1942
01:15:56,738 --> 01:15:58,540
(You guys are so fun to watch.)

1943
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:02,044
It's time for you to wear your eye patches.

1944
01:16:02,044 --> 01:16:03,846
(I need to do something too. Come follow this sound.)

1945
01:16:03,846 --> 01:16:06,315
What was that? What's wrong with you?

1946
01:16:06,315 --> 01:16:07,983
What are you doing?

1947
01:16:07,983 --> 01:16:09,618
(He tries to seduce Kwang Soo by crying like a crow.)

1948
01:16:09,618 --> 01:16:10,786
What are you doing?

1949
01:16:10,786 --> 01:16:12,421
- You can't make sounds. - Aren't we allowed?

1950
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:14,556
- You can make sounds. - See?

1951
01:16:15,023 --> 01:16:18,160
(Really? Then let me make my signature sound as well.)

1952
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:22,364
(They each cry like birds that are mating.)

1953
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:24,132
Is this fun? Are you happy?

1954
01:16:24,132 --> 01:16:26,068
(This is so interesting to watch since I'm not involved.)

1955
01:16:26,235 --> 01:16:28,103
Hey, is it fun to see us so desperate?

1956
01:16:28,103 --> 01:16:29,771
- Hey. - Are you enjoying this?

1957
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:32,074
I finally understand why Running Man is loved by so many people.

1958
01:16:32,074 --> 01:16:33,141
(This must be why our show is so popular.)

1959
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:34,610
Please wear your eye patches.

1960
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,711
Should I take off my bag?

1961
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,881
Once they wear their eye patches, So Min can split them apart.

1962
01:16:38,881 --> 01:16:41,083
- You can separate them. - Okay.

1963
01:16:42,784 --> 01:16:44,987
My gosh, I really can't go alone. I'm being serious.

1964
01:16:44,987 --> 01:16:46,355
Let's just avoid going inside alone.

1965
01:16:46,355 --> 01:16:47,689
- I just need to avoid this. - Seriously.

1966
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:49,992
So Min, please place them wherever you want them to stand.

1967
01:16:50,792 --> 01:16:51,994
- So Min. - Yes?

1968
01:16:52,561 --> 01:16:54,162
- Please be nice. - Okay.

1969
01:16:54,897 --> 01:16:55,931
- So Min, please be nice. - Yes.

1970
01:16:56,131 --> 01:16:57,633
- Stay here. - Where am I?

1971
01:16:57,633 --> 01:17:00,402
- Where's the center? - It's right ahead of you.

1972
01:17:00,602 --> 01:17:01,770
Come here, Kwang Soo.

1973
01:17:02,004 --> 01:17:03,405
- Where are you taking me? - Come here.

1974
01:17:03,739 --> 01:17:05,641
- Where are you taking me? - Come on.

1975
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:10,846
(Wait a minute. Where is she taking him?)

1976
01:17:10,846 --> 01:17:13,615
- What? Where am I going? - No, don't worry.

1977
01:17:13,615 --> 01:17:14,816
Where am I?

1978
01:17:14,816 --> 01:17:17,119
- Follow me. - Why is my voice echoing?

1979
01:17:17,653 --> 01:17:19,254
How am I supposed to get out of here?

1980
01:17:19,421 --> 01:17:21,223
There's nothing in front of you. Take three steps forward.

1981
01:17:21,223 --> 01:17:23,292
1, 2, 3. Good job.

1982
01:17:23,292 --> 01:17:24,660
How do you expect me to get out of here?

1983
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,994
Give it your best try.

1984
01:17:25,994 --> 01:17:27,029
- What? - Is everyone ready?

1985
01:17:27,029 --> 01:17:28,196
- Yes. - Yes.

1986
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:29,831
What is this smell?

1987
01:17:31,867 --> 01:17:36,071
Ready, get set, go!

1988
01:17:36,805 --> 01:17:40,208
(Can you hear me? I'm over here!)

1989
01:17:40,208 --> 01:17:42,244
(Making sounds)

1990
01:17:43,312 --> 01:17:45,247
(Hey, guys! I'm over here!)

1991
01:17:46,014 --> 01:17:47,749
(The two birds are near each other.)

1992
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:48,884
I can hear you.

1993
01:17:48,884 --> 01:17:50,953
(They both get a hold of where the other person is.)

1994
01:17:50,953 --> 01:17:52,187
Jae Seok!

1995
01:17:53,055 --> 01:17:55,324
(They're shocked.)

1996
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:57,192
(Clapping)

1997
01:17:57,192 --> 01:17:58,260
Hey, I hear...

1998
01:17:59,861 --> 01:18:01,697
- I can hear a clap. - So Min.

1999
01:18:01,697 --> 01:18:04,466
(They're lost again because of So Min.)

2000
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:05,934
Kwang Soo!

2001
01:18:05,934 --> 01:18:06,969
(Do you remember this sound, Kwang Soo?)

2002
01:18:07,402 --> 01:18:11,039
(I'm making that sound too. Where are you Seok Jin?)

2003
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,942
(He makes sounds with his mouth as he makes clapping sounds.)

2004
01:18:15,577 --> 01:18:17,446
- Kwang Soo! - Seok Jin!

2005
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:19,181
(Seok Jin slowly approaches where Kwang Soo is hidden.)

2006
01:18:19,715 --> 01:18:21,383
- I can't get out of here! - Who is this?

2007
01:18:21,383 --> 01:18:22,551
Where are you?

2008
01:18:22,751 --> 01:18:25,520
- Seok Jin! - Jae Seok!

2009
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,555
- Where are you? - Where are you?

2010
01:18:26,555 --> 01:18:27,923
I'm over here!

2011
01:18:27,923 --> 01:18:29,224
- Jae Seok! - I'm over here.

2012
01:18:29,524 --> 01:18:31,460
(They both make sounds.)

2013
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,528
- Jae Seok! - I'm here!

2014
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:36,898
- Who is this? Oh, is that you? - What are you doing?

2015
01:18:36,898 --> 01:18:38,867
(I found someone! Oh, it's Kwon Ryeol.)

2016
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:40,035
What do you think I'm doing?

2017
01:18:40,369 --> 01:18:41,570
I'm trying to find my partner.

2018
01:18:41,803 --> 01:18:42,838
I'm here!

2019
01:18:42,904 --> 01:18:47,542
(Where am I right now?)

2020
01:18:48,477 --> 01:18:49,544
Where are you, Seok Jin?

2021
01:18:49,544 --> 01:18:50,912
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin slowly start to approach each other.)

2022
01:18:50,912 --> 01:18:52,347
- Come over here! - Where are you?

2023
01:18:53,148 --> 01:18:54,516
- Here! - I'm here!

2024
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:56,318
Where?

2025
01:18:56,318 --> 01:18:58,353
(They came into contact!)

2026
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:01,523
Who are you? Who are you?

2027
01:19:01,523 --> 01:19:02,791
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin miraculously become partners.)

2028
01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:04,993
Jae Seok and Seok Jin have become partners.

2029
01:19:05,694 --> 01:19:07,062
- I can't believe this. - My gosh!

2030
01:19:07,062 --> 01:19:11,199
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin have become partners.)

2031
01:19:12,634 --> 01:19:13,802
(Wait a minute. They're partners?)

2032
01:19:13,802 --> 01:19:14,836
Wait.

2033
01:19:15,704 --> 01:19:17,806
How was I supposed to get out of there?

2034
01:19:18,673 --> 01:19:19,674
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2035
01:19:19,674 --> 01:19:20,709
Wait.

2036
01:19:21,143 --> 01:19:24,646
(Kwang Soo has to enter Cage of Death by himself.)

2037
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:26,982
You need to sign a safety agreement before you go in.

2038
01:19:26,982 --> 01:19:28,817
Do they need to agree with the fact that they're going to die?

2039
01:19:28,817 --> 01:19:30,552
What are you talking about?

2040
01:19:30,552 --> 01:19:32,354
- Hey. - Why would we die?

2041
01:19:32,621 --> 01:19:35,190
We're not going in there to become their food.

2042
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:36,992
- I can't believe you said that. - We're not going to be their food.

2043
01:19:36,992 --> 01:19:38,527
You can't say stuff like that just because you're not going in.

2044
01:19:38,794 --> 01:19:40,495
- My goodness. - Unbelievable.

2045
01:19:40,495 --> 01:19:42,097
It's not even funny.

2046
01:19:42,264 --> 01:19:43,365
Oh, my gosh.

2047
01:19:43,365 --> 01:19:45,233
(They get ready to sign the safety agreement.)

2048
01:19:45,233 --> 01:19:46,601
What is this?

2049
01:19:47,102 --> 01:19:48,637
Do you know how to read this?

2050
01:19:48,637 --> 01:19:51,640
(It feels scarier because it's written in English.)

2051
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:53,842
My gosh. Cage of Death.

2052
01:19:53,842 --> 01:19:57,712
(They complete signing the safety agreement in fear.)

2053
01:19:58,313 --> 01:20:00,315
- So Min. - Why are we even doing this?

2054
01:20:00,315 --> 01:20:02,250
(This is the cage that we saw on TV.)

2055
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,853
You need to hurry up since there's not a lot of time.

2056
01:20:04,853 --> 01:20:06,154
Okay, okay.

2057
01:20:06,154 --> 01:20:09,257
Okay, we'll hurry up. We'll do as you wish.

2058
01:20:09,658 --> 01:20:10,992
Do we go inside right now?

2059
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:13,595
They said we need to hurry up to meet the schedule.

2060
01:20:14,362 --> 01:20:15,697
I'm really angry right now.

2061
01:20:15,697 --> 01:20:17,099
I didn't know the crocodiles had a schedule.

2062
01:20:17,132 --> 01:20:18,667
- I didn't know that. - I'm so upset.

2063
01:20:18,934 --> 01:20:22,237
The crocodiles' schedule is more important than ours.

2064
01:20:22,237 --> 01:20:24,506
The crocodiles are busy scaring so many people every day.

2065
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:28,643
- Do we need to wear this? - Why do we need to wear this?

2066
01:20:28,643 --> 01:20:30,212
So that we can get a good look of the crocodiles.

2067
01:20:30,812 --> 01:20:32,047
How am I supposed to put this on?

2068
01:20:32,314 --> 01:20:34,749
(I'm very aware of how angry you are right now.)

2069
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:36,485
They want us to take a video of the crocodiles with this.

2070
01:20:37,819 --> 01:20:40,055
- So you're practically a camera. - That's right.

2071
01:20:40,455 --> 01:20:41,690
So Min, you should join us too.

2072
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,024
(Seok Jin puts on his diving mask.)

2073
01:20:44,593 --> 01:20:45,994
Why are you wearing it like that?

2074
01:20:46,595 --> 01:20:48,830
I think she should join us.

2075
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:50,332
Why do you have two noses?

2076
01:20:50,332 --> 01:20:52,067
How am I supposed to do this? How do I wear this?

2077
01:20:52,067 --> 01:20:54,970
- Like this. - Then I can't breathe.

2078
01:20:55,804 --> 01:20:57,439
- What are you doing? - That's how you wear it.

2079
01:20:57,439 --> 01:20:58,940
Then I won't be able to breathe.

2080
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:01,776
- It'll leak that way. - How am I supposed to wear this?

2081
01:21:01,776 --> 01:21:03,145
(Seok Jin's big nose isn't helping at all.)

2082
01:21:03,145 --> 01:21:05,147
- I can't even wear this properly. - I'm so worried for him.

2083
01:21:05,213 --> 01:21:06,982
It's because Seok Jin's old.

2084
01:21:07,182 --> 01:21:09,217
- He's never worn this. - This is my first time.

2085
01:21:09,584 --> 01:21:10,852
Let's go inside.

2086
01:21:10,852 --> 01:21:12,988
We're not mentally ready yet.

2087
01:21:13,855 --> 01:21:15,323
This is driving me crazy.

2088
01:21:17,993 --> 01:21:19,861
I'm so nervous.

2089
01:21:19,861 --> 01:21:21,763
(They finally enter the infamous Cage of Death.)

2090
01:21:21,763 --> 01:21:24,566
(Both Jae Seok and Seok Jin can't stop sighing.)

2091
01:21:24,566 --> 01:21:28,603
My gosh, I still don't understand why I have to do this.

2092
01:21:29,571 --> 01:21:32,607
(The guy who needs to enter by himself feels more uneasy.)

2093
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:34,109
We're ready.

2094
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:36,077
- Are you ready? - We're ready.

2095
01:21:36,077 --> 01:21:37,946
- Are you sure? - We're champions.

2096
01:21:37,946 --> 01:21:40,649
Head on outside. When you go down the ladder, you need to face me.

2097
01:21:40,649 --> 01:21:43,818
(It's even more disturbing to watch.)

2098
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,055
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2099
01:21:47,055 --> 01:21:51,159
(They can't see the bottom of the ladder.)

2100
01:21:52,194 --> 01:21:57,165
(They're on their way to see the aggressive crocodiles.)

2101
01:21:57,933 --> 01:22:00,101
The crocodiles are angry. The crocodiles are hungry.

2102
01:22:00,368 --> 01:22:02,370
- They're angry and hungry. - Yes. They're angry and hungry.

2103
01:22:04,673 --> 01:22:06,107
(It's a lot more frightening from up above.)

2104
01:22:06,107 --> 01:22:07,943
My gosh, this is crazy. Why are we doing this?

2105
01:22:07,943 --> 01:22:09,444
You need to turn around and climb down.

2106
01:22:09,444 --> 01:22:10,712
My gosh.

2107
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,048
I guess it's really narrow.

2108
01:22:13,782 --> 01:22:16,318
- Is it just the two of us? - This is so scary.

2109
01:22:16,318 --> 01:22:17,652
Don't we get a guardian?

2110
01:22:18,386 --> 01:22:20,021
No. They're going to remove the ladder.

2111
01:22:20,021 --> 01:22:21,590
- What? Really? - Yes.

2112
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:23,024
My gosh.

2113
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:25,894
We're going to remove the ladder. There are small holes like this.

2114
01:22:25,894 --> 01:22:28,230
- We need to keep our hands away. - Yes. Don't put your hands there.

2115
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:31,233
The chain will extend once we move the cage.

2116
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:32,901
- So be careful not to get caught. - Okay.

2117
01:22:32,901 --> 01:22:35,604
- We'll get rid of the ladder now. - Have there been any accidents?

2118
01:22:35,604 --> 01:22:36,738
Let's just hope nothing happens.

2119
01:22:36,738 --> 01:22:40,242
(It's bulletproof glass, but they can't help but feel nervous.)

2120
01:22:40,775 --> 01:22:42,611
(They finally remove the ladder.)

2121
01:22:42,611 --> 01:22:44,946
So Min, you can watch them from downstairs.

2122
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,281
We'll see you downstairs, you guys.

2123
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:48,083
Bye, guys.

2124
01:22:48,483 --> 01:22:50,518
My gosh, I have to go in there by myself.

2125
01:22:53,855 --> 01:22:56,791
Look at all these scratches from their teeth.

2126
01:22:56,791 --> 01:23:00,095
(These scratches are from the crocodiles' teeth and claws.)

2127
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:01,529
This is crazy.

2128
01:23:01,863 --> 01:23:02,897
(The cage starts moving.)

2129
01:23:03,932 --> 01:23:05,934
(They begin going down.)

2130
01:23:05,934 --> 01:23:07,402
- Tell us first. - My gosh, that shocked me.

2131
01:23:07,402 --> 01:23:08,570
Please tell us before this moves.

2132
01:23:11,206 --> 01:23:12,207
(They're now fully disconnected.)

2133
01:23:12,207 --> 01:23:14,142
- I can't believe this. - My gosh.

2134
01:23:14,142 --> 01:23:15,744
- I'll close the cage now. - Okay.

2135
01:23:15,744 --> 01:23:16,911
I hope you come back alive.

2136
01:23:16,911 --> 01:23:18,580
Please don't say that.

2137
01:23:18,713 --> 01:23:20,115
- Be careful. - Okay.

2138
01:23:20,115 --> 01:23:21,483
My goodness.

2139
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:23,852
- Oh, my gosh! - My goodness!

2140
01:23:24,185 --> 01:23:25,754
- Hey, keep your hands safe. - Okay.

2141
01:23:26,154 --> 01:23:27,222
Keep your hands inside.

2142
01:23:27,956 --> 01:23:29,357
Where are we going?

2143
01:23:29,991 --> 01:23:33,695
(The cage is heading towards Axel, the crocodile that's 5m long.)

2144
01:23:33,695 --> 01:23:35,397
- This is driving me crazy. - My goodness.

2145
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:38,600
(The cage is heading towards Axel, the crocodile that's 5m long.)

2146
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,536
- This is really scary. - We're so high up.

2147
01:23:41,703 --> 01:23:43,738
- This cage is too tiny. - It's so scary.

2148
01:23:43,738 --> 01:23:45,507
This is already scary enough.

2149
01:23:45,874 --> 01:23:47,342
- This is the crocodile. - My gosh.

2150
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:50,478
It just passed by.

2151
01:23:51,313 --> 01:23:52,414
I guess they're going to come here.

2152
01:23:52,747 --> 01:23:58,253
(A huge crocodile that's about 900kg is right above their heads.)

2153
01:23:58,253 --> 01:23:59,287
They're coming.

2154
01:23:59,287 --> 01:24:01,990
(A huge crocodile that's about 900kg is right above their heads.)

2155
01:24:02,791 --> 01:24:07,162
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin haven't seen the crocodile yet.)

2156
01:24:07,462 --> 01:24:09,064
This is... My gosh.

2157
01:24:09,064 --> 01:24:10,865
(Where in the world is the crocodile?)

2158
01:24:10,865 --> 01:24:12,434
Where's the crocodile?

2159
01:24:12,434 --> 01:24:14,302
Where is it?

2160
01:24:16,071 --> 01:24:17,906
My gosh, are we going down?

2161
01:24:18,173 --> 01:24:20,342
(The cage finally descends.)

2162
01:24:20,342 --> 01:24:21,943
This is driving me crazy.

2163
01:24:21,943 --> 01:24:24,779
(The cage finally descends.)

2164
01:24:28,583 --> 01:24:31,353
- Is there water coming in? - The water's coming in now.

2165
01:24:32,153 --> 01:24:35,357
(They start to feel scared as their feet start getting cold.)

2166
01:24:35,357 --> 01:24:36,591
They're coming in.

2167
01:24:37,192 --> 01:24:38,526
They're here.

2168
01:24:39,694 --> 01:24:40,762
I can't believe this.

2169
01:24:40,762 --> 01:24:43,198
(So Min and Kwang Soo are also shocked by what they see.)

2170
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:44,332
They're really inside.

2171
01:24:44,733 --> 01:24:47,202
They're so nearby. That's a real crocodile.

2172
01:24:47,202 --> 01:24:48,603
(Is this seriously happening?)

2173
01:24:48,603 --> 01:24:50,638
- The crocodile's moving. - It's a real crocodile.

2174
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:54,409
It's a real, living crocodile. This is crazy.

2175
01:24:56,344 --> 01:24:57,846
My gosh, how deep are we going to go?

2176
01:24:57,846 --> 01:24:59,114
(They're panicking.)

2177
01:24:59,114 --> 01:25:00,648
- What is this? - Are we really going to be okay?

2178
01:25:00,648 --> 01:25:02,417
- Where is it? - Where's the crocodile?

2179
01:25:02,484 --> 01:25:04,185
- My gosh. - How deep are we going to go?

2180
01:25:04,486 --> 01:25:06,354
This is much scarier.

2181
01:25:06,921 --> 01:25:08,456
- Where's the crocodile? - I don't know.

2182
01:25:09,157 --> 01:25:10,992
- My gosh. - Don't move the cage. Be careful.

2183
01:25:10,992 --> 01:25:12,560
- Stop shaking the cage. - Hey!

2184
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,828
- What is this? - My gosh.

2185
01:25:13,962 --> 01:25:15,196
My goodness.

2186
01:25:15,363 --> 01:25:17,232
- It's right here. - It's over there.

2187
01:25:17,232 --> 01:25:18,867
My gosh, it's right over there.

2188
01:25:19,067 --> 01:25:21,636
- Where? - It's right here. Look over there.

2189
01:25:21,636 --> 01:25:22,771
(The infamous crocodile that weighs 900kg is right before their eyes.)

2190
01:25:26,174 --> 01:25:29,711
(It starts moving as soon as it sees humans.)

2191
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:31,246
- My gosh. - That startled me.

2192
01:25:31,246 --> 01:25:32,647
What is this? Where did it go?

2193
01:25:33,515 --> 01:25:35,283
- My gosh, it's moving. - I know.

2194
01:25:35,283 --> 01:25:36,518
- It's moving. - Exactly.

2195
01:25:37,185 --> 01:25:38,453
My gosh. Look.

2196
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:40,054
It came down.

2197
01:25:40,655 --> 01:25:41,790
It came down.

2198
01:25:42,857 --> 01:25:48,263
(The ruthless crocodile, Axel, is right in front of the cage.)

2199
01:25:48,263 --> 01:25:50,298
It's right in front of us.

2200
01:25:53,635 --> 01:25:56,171
(I am the predator of this area.)

2201
01:25:58,039 --> 01:25:59,574
(Shouting)

2202
01:26:01,276 --> 01:26:03,311
(Munching)

2203
01:26:06,648 --> 01:26:07,982
It's so big.

2204
01:26:07,982 --> 01:26:09,184
Look at its teeth, Kwang Soo!

2205
01:26:10,151 --> 01:26:11,252
Look at its teeth!

2206
01:26:12,454 --> 01:26:14,622
It hurt its tooth.

2207
01:26:14,622 --> 01:26:17,158
(The broken tooth is a testament of its strong jaw movements.)

2208
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:22,197
My goodness.

2209
01:26:22,764 --> 01:26:25,600
It's as big as a house. It's so big.

2210
01:26:28,436 --> 01:26:30,004
(Startled)

2211
01:26:30,805 --> 01:26:33,174
(It tries to swallow the pole that is used for feeding.)

2212
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:36,711
- Stay still. - My goodness, it looked at me.

2213
01:26:38,313 --> 01:26:39,948
Look at this. Come here.

2214
01:26:40,615 --> 01:26:41,649
Come here.

2215
01:26:43,351 --> 01:26:45,119
It's cute.

2216
01:26:45,753 --> 01:26:47,989
It's not cute. Don't call it cute.

2217
01:26:47,989 --> 01:26:49,057
It's cute.

2218
01:26:49,891 --> 01:26:51,593
Stop it. Don't do that.

2219
01:26:51,593 --> 01:26:53,027
(She tries to communicate with the crocodile.)

2220
01:26:53,027 --> 01:26:54,329
Its foot is so big.

2221
01:26:56,264 --> 01:26:57,999
Look, it's peeing.

2222
01:26:58,633 --> 01:27:00,902
- It's peeing. - What is that?

2223
01:27:01,536 --> 01:27:02,904
My goodness.

2224
01:27:02,904 --> 01:27:05,406
(What is that?)

2225
01:27:08,543 --> 01:27:11,579
Don't say that.

2226
01:27:12,881 --> 01:27:14,315
What was that?

2227
01:27:14,315 --> 01:27:16,351
Are you asking because you really don't know?

2228
01:27:17,285 --> 01:27:18,686
What was that? Did you see that?

2229
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:23,391
(They can't describe what they saw.)

2230
01:27:24,092 --> 01:27:26,661
(The world of crocodile is embarrassing and shocking.)

2231
01:27:30,265 --> 01:27:31,933
I told you to stay away.

2232
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,334
I told you to stay away.

2233
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:38,106
You weren't respectful towards the crocodile.

2234
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:40,275
(It's a male crocodile.)

2235
01:27:40,275 --> 01:27:41,342
It's a male crocodile.

2236
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:43,845
- Hey. - Is it a male crocodile?

2237
01:27:43,845 --> 01:27:44,879
(At that moment)

2238
01:27:47,115 --> 01:27:50,118
(After peeing, the crocodile thrashes more violently.)

2239
01:27:51,352 --> 01:27:54,022
(Screaming)

2240
01:27:55,323 --> 01:27:58,026
(They back away as farthest as they can go.)

2241
01:27:58,526 --> 01:28:00,461
- It's going that way. - It's going.

2242
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:04,399
(It's angry jaws threaten the middle-aged men.)

2243
01:28:04,933 --> 01:28:07,035
- It's going that way. - It's going.

2244
01:28:07,035 --> 01:28:08,670
(Screaming)

2245
01:28:10,038 --> 01:28:13,274
(Fear makes them scream in the water.)

2246
01:28:13,274 --> 01:28:17,412
(They turn pale in a few minutes.)

2247
01:28:18,146 --> 01:28:19,180
It's angry.

2248
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:20,982
It must be angry.

2249
01:28:20,982 --> 01:28:22,016
(We apologize if we made you angry.)

2250
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:23,451
It's under us.

2251
01:28:23,451 --> 01:28:26,854
(It goes to rest in the water.)

2252
01:28:26,854 --> 01:28:27,922
(Maybe not.)

2253
01:28:30,024 --> 01:28:32,393
(It threatens them by slamming against the cage.)

2254
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:38,299
(Its movements are more aggressive.)

2255
01:28:39,634 --> 01:28:47,208
(Can Jae Seok and Seok Jin finish the penalty successfully?)

2256
01:28:49,644 --> 01:28:50,678
(Next week)

2257
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:53,081
(It's the real deal.)

2258
01:28:53,715 --> 01:28:57,452
(The king of crocodiles, Chopper appears.)

2259
01:28:57,452 --> 01:29:00,288
(It's more aggressive and ruthless.)

2260
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:04,092
(Can the members come out in one piece?)

2261
01:29:05,393 --> 01:29:08,062
(This time, they meet the wild crocodiles.)

2262
01:29:08,062 --> 01:29:11,399
(They explore the wild swamp that is full of crocodiles.)

2263
01:29:11,899 --> 01:29:13,668
(The crocodile egg isn't that big.)
