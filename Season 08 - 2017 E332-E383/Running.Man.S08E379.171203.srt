1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,794
(Last week on Running Man)

2
00:00:07,794 --> 00:00:09,896
(People's Recommendation Project: Place for 1 Percent)

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,500
(It was decided that Haha and Se Chan will ride Nevis Swing.)

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,902
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo, exempted from the penalty, joined them.)

5
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:17,437
You are to accompany them to New Zealand.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,474
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are to experience the Cage of Death.)

7
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:22,776
You'll travel for your penalty.

8
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:26,579
(As So Min and Seok Jin joined them, their penalty trips began.)

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:29,382
(Are there suspicious Chance Cards for this trip?)

10
00:00:30,517 --> 00:00:35,188
(They chose 3 cards which can be either helpful or disadvantageous.)

11
00:00:35,188 --> 00:00:38,792
(They can only check their cards when they accomplish missions.)

12
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:40,994
(They can also decline to use the cards.)

13
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:43,196
- We can refuse to use them? - We don't have to use them.

14
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:46,700
(And thus began their Swallowtail Butterfly Tour.)

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,535
(Two teams headed to Darwin and Queenstown.)

16
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,471
(Both teams arrived in Australia and New Zealand.)

17
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:55,175
(Team New Zealand successfully accomplished their first mission.)

18
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:59,279
(They decided to choose 1 card between 2 cards.)

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,114
(All of us won't complain about the penalty.)

20
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:04,984
(Everyone on Team New Zealand won a chance to ride Nevis Swing.)

21
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:08,788
(Team Australia also successfully accomplished their first mission.)

22
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:14,894
(They chose a card that gave another member to join their penalty.)

23
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:19,165
(Seok Jin, the slippery fellow of Jamwon-dong, is chosen.)

24
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:23,169
(They finally reached the ultimate place for Cage of Death.)

25
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,205
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin will enter the cage together,)

26
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:29,142
(and Kwang Soo will enter the cage all by himself.)

27
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:34,280
(Will they be able to overcome their fear and complete the penalty?)

28
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:40,320
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok's cage is descending toward Axel.)

29
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,889
Is there water coming in?

30
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:44,023
The water's coming in now.

31
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,961
(They start to feel scared as their feet start getting cold.)

32
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:49,028
They're going in.

33
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,830
They're in the water.

34
00:01:52,332 --> 00:01:53,333
I can't believe this.

35
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:55,201
(So Min and Kwang Soo are also shocked by what they see.)

36
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:56,836
They're really inside.

37
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:58,471
They're really close.

38
00:01:58,605 --> 00:01:59,706
That's a real crocodile.

39
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,175
- The crocodile's moving. - It's a real crocodile.

40
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,579
It's a real, living crocodile. This is crazy.

41
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:08,815
Oh, no. Jae Seok is scared.

42
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,050
They went into the water.

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,019
- Where? - It's right here. Here.

44
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,621
Gosh, I'm scared!

45
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:19,325
(The crocodile starts batting the cage at the sight of them.)

46
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:22,328
- My gosh. It startled me. - What's going on? It's moving.

47
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,764
- It's moving! - It's coming.

48
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:26,132
- It's moving. - I saw it too.

49
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,335
My gosh, look. It came down.

50
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,438
It came down after spotting them.

51
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:32,672
My gosh.

52
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:35,742
(The ruthless crocodile, Axel, is right in front of the cage.)

53
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:38,411
It's right in front of us.

54
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:41,247
I saw it!

55
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,316
(I'm the predator around here!)

56
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:47,454
(Bellowing in fear)

57
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,521
It's huge!

58
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:54,060
(Crunching)

59
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,163
(Frozen)

60
00:02:58,398 --> 00:02:59,632
- It's so big. - My gosh!

61
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:00,934
Look at its teeth, Kwang Soo!

62
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:02,936
Look at its teeth!

63
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:07,774
(The broken tooth is a testament of its strong jaw movements.)

64
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,312
- My goodness. - Oh, dear!

65
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:14,881
- It's as big as a house. - Seriously.

66
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,882
It's gigantic!

67
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:19,185
(Escaping this cold cage is impossible.)

68
00:03:20,854 --> 00:03:22,188
(Startled)

69
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:25,825
(They're lucky they didn't pass out in the water.)

70
00:03:25,825 --> 00:03:28,061
- Stay still. - My goodness.

71
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:29,162
It looked at me.

72
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:33,266
(Axel even tries to eat up the pole used in feeding.)

73
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:38,404
(It scares the life out of them.)

74
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,910
- It's heading that way. - It's on the move.

75
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,847
(The furious-looking jaw threatens Jae Seok and Seok Jin.)

76
00:03:48,314 --> 00:03:50,550
- It's heading that way. - It's on the move.

77
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,586
(He can't refrain himself from screaming even in the water.)

78
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,292
(Their countenance grows pale in a matter of few minutes.)

79
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,196
- It must be angry. - I think it's furious.

80
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:04,397
It must be livid.

81
00:04:04,397 --> 00:04:05,765
(We will repent if we upset you.)

82
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,669
(It continues to hover around them.)

83
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,204
It's here. The crocodile is close.

84
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:12,405
It's there.

85
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:15,942
(I'm begging you. Please get away from us.)

86
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:17,577
It's going under them.

87
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,379
It just bit.

88
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:25,318
(I'll just go down to rest quietly.)

89
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:27,220
(Did you fall for that?)

90
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:30,423
(It intimidates them as it bats the cage.)

91
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:33,560
(Shaking)

92
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:39,732
(Will Jae Seok and Seok Jin be able to complete their penalty?)

93
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,069
(Snapping)

94
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:44,537
My goodness.

95
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:49,876
(It's getting riled up by the scent of humans in the off-peak season.)

96
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,279
(Is Seok Jin losing his mind?)

97
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:56,482
Don't go near it. Don't.

98
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:57,817
- Don't get close. - Why?

99
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:58,918
It's angry. It's livid.

100
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:00,386
It bumped into the cage.

101
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,690
Did you hear it breathing?

102
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,891
Did you see it snapping?

103
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,530
(Is she writing an emergency message?)

104
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,368
(Crocodile, let's go.)

105
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,037
(Crocodile, let's go.)

106
00:05:18,037 --> 00:05:20,006
Did you write "Crocodile, let's go"?

107
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,741
Why would you cheer for the crocodile?

108
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,811
You should cheer for the members, not the crocodile.

109
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:27,647
It's simply going about its day.

110
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:30,683
(So Min inspires Kwang Soo to write something as well.)

111
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:31,951
I wrote something as well.

112
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:33,620
"Cinnamon flavor"?

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,621
(Cinnamon flavor and vanilla flavor)

114
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,089
- Seok Jin is cinnamon flavor, - Cinnamon flavor.

115
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:37,724
- and Jae Seok is vanilla flavor. - Jae Seok is vanilla flavor.

116
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,294
Is Jae Seok 46 years old?

117
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,162
(Seok Jin is 52 years old, and Jae Seok is 46 years old.)

118
00:05:43,162 --> 00:05:47,467
(She even provides the year of manufacture.)

119
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,735
Can you read this?

120
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,236
Can you read this?

121
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,171
(Put it down this instant.)

122
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,306
It feels strange.

123
00:05:53,906 --> 00:05:55,541
This is really scary.

124
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:58,111
It's so big.

125
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,481
Jae Seok and Seok Jin's penalty ends here.

126
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:04,283
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok's Cage of Death penalty ends.)

127
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,352
Kwang Soo, please go get ready.

128
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:09,856
(Is it my turn?)

129
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,994
(Kwang Soo is an A plus. Look forward to it.)

130
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:21,434
(I am not Korean beef.)

131
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:25,672
The container shook when the crocodile struck it.

132
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:28,474
(The warriors finally step on land.)

133
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:30,043
It was scary.

134
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,178
It was scary.

135
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:34,781
The way it snapped its jaw was very scary.

136
00:06:36,549 --> 00:06:38,217
It's really huge.

137
00:06:38,217 --> 00:06:39,919
- It's really big, right? - Its size is no joke.

138
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,921
- Seok Jin. - Did it look big from the outside?

139
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:43,356
- It's really big. - It was no joke.

140
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:44,524
- Does it look big from the outside? - Yes.

141
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:45,858
- Also, - It's huge.

142
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:47,360
when the crocodile struck the container,

143
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:48,861
- it shook. - It left a mark.

144
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:50,863
It left a mark on the container.

145
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,732
- It left a mark. - It left a mark with its teeth.

146
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,167
You should go inside now.

147
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,535
- This is nice. - You should go inside alone.

148
00:06:55,535 --> 00:06:58,037
- It was... - The cameraman won't go, right?

149
00:06:58,037 --> 00:06:59,238
You will go alone.

150
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,606
Please give me back my glasses.

151
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:01,674
(I don't have Cameraman Yoon Sang by my side today.)

152
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:03,976
By the way, the pool Kwang Soo will enter...

153
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:07,246
has the biggest crocodile that's 5.5m long and weighs 790kg.

154
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,615
It's Lee Byung Hun among crocodiles.

155
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:10,783
- That's right. - "Inside Men".

156
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:11,851
(That's the crocodile I will see.)

157
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,854
(Its lack of front legs shows that it had a wild life.)

158
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:20,059
(Chopper measures 5.5m and weighs 790kg.)

159
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,863
(Kwang Soo, are you here by yourself?)

160
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,231
"The name says it all."

161
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,033
Chopper.

162
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,601
5.5m...

163
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,104
- It looks bigger in the water. - I think it does.

164
00:07:31,604 --> 00:07:33,239
It's three times longer than me.

165
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:41,114
(Chopper is the king of crocodiles and is bigger than most cars.)

166
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:46,486
(Kwang Soo finally enters Cage of Death by himself.)

167
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:47,854
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

168
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,555
- Be careful. - Say your last words.

169
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:50,723
- Say your last words. - It looks dangerous.

170
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:53,426
Don't say that.

171
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:55,061
- Say a few words. - Don't say that.

172
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,429
Give me the PIN number of your bank account.

173
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,231
Why would I give you the PIN number of my bank account?

174
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,433
- This is your last chance. - Is it good?

175
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:01,601
- It's good. - Is it good?

176
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:03,803
Your money could be lost.

177
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:06,105
(Be quiet.)

178
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:10,409
(So Min teases Kwang Soo when he is feeling faint.)

179
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:12,612
Why would you ask him that?

180
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,781
This could be his last moment.

181
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:16,349
Kwang Soo.

182
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:18,718
Why didn't she get picked for this penalty?

183
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,221
(It's fun to watch them.)

184
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:23,623
- For goodness' sake. - She is so annoying.

185
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:25,925
(He enters the cage by himself.)

186
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,226
I am really entering the cage by myself.

187
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:28,427
(He enters the cage by himself.)

188
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,563
What is this?

189
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:31,798
(What is this?)

190
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:33,800
Where did it go wrong?

191
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,301
I am in a cage by myself.

192
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,469
Okay.

193
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:38,037
Let's do this.

194
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:39,105
Hi, Kwang Soo.

195
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,873
- Go away. - Good luck.

196
00:08:40,907 --> 00:08:43,376
Okay, okay.

197
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,479
Where did it go wrong? Where did it go wrong?

198
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,847
I will watch you from below.

199
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:49,182
(Chopper is waiting somewhere in the pool.)

200
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,483
Where is it? Where is it?

201
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:53,286
(Chopper is waiting somewhere in the pool.)

202
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,154
- We will remove the ladder. - Okay.

203
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:58,224
(The ladder is removed.)

204
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:00,359
- Don't wet your pants. - I won't.

205
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:02,929
(He is alone now.)

206
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:04,463
What is this on the bottom?

207
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,932
There is something.

208
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:08,734
The bottom is made of a net. That startled me.

209
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,670
Gosh, it's going down. Okay.

210
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,172
It's like going into a pool.

211
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,541
It's like going into a tub.

212
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,477
I'm just soaking half of my body.

213
00:09:19,712 --> 00:09:20,980
She is closing the entrance.

214
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,215
Thank you.

215
00:09:22,215 --> 00:09:23,783
I will be next door to see Chopper.

216
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:25,051
Yes. Chopper.

217
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:26,219
(Good luck.)

218
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,720
- See you. - See you.

219
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:29,555
My goodness.

220
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:30,990
(The cage begins to move.)

221
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,058
My goodness.

222
00:09:32,158 --> 00:09:34,160
Okay. Okay.

223
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,663
It's like a merry-go-round.

224
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,800
My goodness.

225
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,869
(He pours out words when he is nervous.)

226
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:44,036
This is crazy.

227
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,239
The bottom is made out of a net.

228
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:48,875
Is this secure?

229
00:09:49,475 --> 00:09:50,543
It opens.

230
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:53,846
(He is nervous.)

231
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:55,681
This is crazy.

232
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,116
I mean...

233
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:58,150
(Kwang Soo's lonely words fill the cage.)

234
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,986
It opens. It shouldn't open.

235
00:09:59,986 --> 00:10:01,721
All right. Okay.

236
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,422
I can do this. I can.

237
00:10:03,422 --> 00:10:04,790
There isn't a problem. Okay.

238
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,058
(Mumbling)

239
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,194
My goodness.

240
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:09,996
Okay. Let's go.

241
00:10:09,996 --> 00:10:11,364
(The cage moves toward Chopper's pool.)

242
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,331
Okay.

243
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:14,400
(The cage moves toward Chopper's pool.)

244
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:18,137
(In the pool...)

245
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:21,040
(is Chopper.)

246
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,275
It's big.

247
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:24,143
- It's really big. - It's big.

248
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:25,177
(It's really big.)

249
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:26,879
It's huge.

250
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,748
It's the ferocious one.

251
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:31,751
(Welcome, Kwang Soo.)

252
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:34,053
My goodness.

253
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:38,457
(Chopper is beneath his feet.)

254
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:40,960
My goodness, it's big.

255
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:43,496
It's big.

256
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:47,366
It's too big. The cage is going too near.

257
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,834
No.

258
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:49,902
Too near!

259
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:51,170
(He uses his English skills.)

260
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,271
Too near!

261
00:10:53,906 --> 00:10:56,709
(A close look at a crocodile that measures 5.5m and weighs 790kg)

262
00:10:56,709 --> 00:10:57,944
It's too big.

263
00:10:58,244 --> 00:10:59,278
What was that?

264
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,981
(Splashing)

265
00:11:02,782 --> 00:11:03,916
Okay.

266
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:08,955
(The cage enters the pool, and the water comes up.)

267
00:11:08,955 --> 00:11:11,390
It's going down.

268
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,459
My goodness.

269
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,262
Chopper. Okay.

270
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:20,366
(He moves backward.)

271
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,968
Okay.

272
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:25,805
(He can only say "My goodness" and "What should I do?")

273
00:11:25,805 --> 00:11:27,106
What should I do?

274
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:32,678
(There is Chopper right before the cage.)

275
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,013
It's right in front of me.

276
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:36,983
Chopper has a lot of scars.

277
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:38,617
He must have had a hard life.

278
00:11:40,319 --> 00:11:42,922
I am just going to look at you...

279
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:44,156
inside this cage.

280
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,392
My goodness.

281
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,794
It's your toy.

282
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:52,798
(Chopper's favorite toy enters the pool.)

283
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:53,899
It's too big.

284
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:54,967
(It doesn't change upon second look.)

285
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,339
(Biting)

286
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,440
Okay.

287
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:06,979
(Chopper welcomes the yellow ball with enthusiasm.)

288
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:08,647
(Look at the way it bites.)

289
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,316
It bit the ball.

290
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,084
- Okay, okay, okay. - It's angry.

291
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,452
- My goodness. - How scary!

292
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,654
All right. Here it goes.

293
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:17,857
Okay.

294
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,459
It bit the ball. Okay.

295
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,228
My goodness.

296
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:23,496
It's too close.

297
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:27,133
(After warming up with a ball, Chopper moves toward Kwang Soo.)

298
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,670
- Kwang Soo is wearing a yellow top. - Kwang Soo is wearing a yellow top.

299
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,738
My goodness.

300
00:12:33,406 --> 00:12:35,641
Both the ball and Kwang Soo are yellow.

301
00:12:35,641 --> 00:12:37,309
(Kwang Soo's top is the same color as Chopper's favorite toy.)

302
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:39,245
His top is the same color as the ball.

303
00:12:39,245 --> 00:12:40,546
(Kwang Soo's top is the same color as Chopper's favorite toy.)

304
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,248
After the ball agitates the crocodile...

305
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:43,582
Well,

306
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:45,151
it's a coincidence...

307
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:48,054
that Kwang Soo wore a yellow top.

308
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:49,588
It's a coincidence.

309
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:51,657
My goodness.

310
00:12:51,657 --> 00:12:52,792
(To Chopper, Kwang Soo is a bigger ball.)

311
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,361
It bit the ball. Okay. My goodness.

312
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,363
It's too close.

313
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,266
You live up to your name.

314
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:01,867
Good job, Chopper.

315
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:09,241
(Biting)

316
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,177
(Flailing)

317
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:12,878
My goodness.

318
00:13:14,447 --> 00:13:15,514
My goodness.

319
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:19,218
(That big, yellow ball looks fun.)

320
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,121
I am only standing next to it.

321
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:23,823
He has...

322
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:24,957
(The big, yellow ball trembles in fear.)

323
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,125
He has no reason to dislike me.

324
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:28,194
He has no reason to mind me.

325
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,698
It's too close. It's too close.

326
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:34,834
(Against Kwang Soo's wish, the cage moves towards Chopper.)

327
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:36,669
The cage shouldn't go further.

328
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:38,404
Chopper will get agitated.

329
00:13:38,537 --> 00:13:40,539
Chopper might get agitated.

330
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:42,641
The cage might touch him.

331
00:13:43,042 --> 00:13:44,610
He might look me in the eyes.

332
00:13:44,777 --> 00:13:47,279
Wait, Chopper is looking in this direction.

333
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,380
(They are close enough to have eye contact.)

334
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,515
He is looking in this direction.

335
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,250
My goodness.

336
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:52,751
This is...

337
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,886
(This is interesting.)

338
00:13:53,886 --> 00:13:55,488
Where is he going?

339
00:13:57,423 --> 00:14:01,760
(Snapping)

340
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:07,399
(This is how strong Chopper is.)

341
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:11,337
(The sound of its teeth sends chills down his spine.)

342
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:15,074
He is too close.

343
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:16,475
Gosh, you came so close.

344
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:18,544
(Chopper circles Kwang Soo like he is on a hunt.)

345
00:14:18,544 --> 00:14:21,380
My goodness. I can't do this.

346
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:22,648
My goodness.

347
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:24,884
(Chopper circles Kwang Soo like he is on a hunt.)

348
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:27,386
My goodness. You are coming in this direction.

349
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:32,024
(Is it good? Is it a yellow ball?)

350
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,793
(It circles Kwang Soo for a while.)

351
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:38,364
(Snapping)

352
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:45,404
(Even from the outside, they feel the power of Chopper's bite.)

353
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,006
It's climbing the cage.

354
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,876
My goodness.

355
00:14:51,877 --> 00:14:53,045
My goodness.

356
00:14:53,045 --> 00:14:57,116
(Chopper lives up to his name as he continues to chop.)

357
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:01,453
(Calm down, Chopper.)

358
00:15:02,054 --> 00:15:05,024
(Flailing)

359
00:15:06,058 --> 00:15:08,194
He's startled.

360
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:10,462
It makes you do that with your feet.

361
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:12,298
It makes you do that.

362
00:15:12,298 --> 00:15:14,567
If feels as if the cage is not there.

363
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:15,568
It's scary.

364
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,436
- You don't see the cage. - It's scary.

365
00:15:17,436 --> 00:15:19,605
It feels as if you are floating in the water.

366
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,174
(Chopper bites at the cage again.)

367
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:24,743
The cage got a scratch.

368
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:28,380
The cage got a scratch.

369
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:31,250
What happened? Gosh.

370
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,719
(Chopper keeps biting at the cage.)

371
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,757
(It has calmed down.)

372
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,759
(It's hovering around the cage.)

373
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,228
What is it doing?

374
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:48,133
It would have been dangerous without that cage.

375
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,136
(It puts its head close to the cage.)

376
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:53,505
- It's showing its face. - It moves so fast.

377
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,074
- It's very active. - Gosh.

378
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:59,645
- Look at that. - Chopper is smiling.

379
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:02,615
I think he likes him.

380
00:16:05,818 --> 00:16:11,090
(Chopper was trying to attract Kwang Soo's attention.)

381
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:15,761
The zookeeper thinks you should try to kiss him.

382
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:18,564
(Kiss?)

383
00:16:19,798 --> 00:16:23,702
(Those who get along with Chopper can kiss him.)

384
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,171
The zookeeper has never seen anyone...

385
00:16:26,171 --> 00:16:28,474
Chopper liked so much.

386
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:30,576
She thinks...

387
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:32,678
Kwang Soo should try kissing him.

388
00:16:32,678 --> 00:16:35,014
Kwang Soo is too scared. He's avoiding Chopper.

389
00:16:35,014 --> 00:16:36,882
(Kwang Soo is trying to kiss Chopper, but he's scared.)

390
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:39,518
- Is he going to kiss him for real? - No.

391
00:16:40,185 --> 00:16:41,787
He can't do that.

392
00:16:41,787 --> 00:16:44,556
- I see. - You mean inside the cage?

393
00:16:44,556 --> 00:16:46,692
- Through the cage? - Yes.

394
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,594
That wasn't our plan.

395
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,130
Kissing is too...

396
00:16:51,664 --> 00:16:53,766
(Kwang Soo, bite the bullet, and kiss me.)

397
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,567
It's too close.

398
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,038
Kiss him.

399
00:16:59,038 --> 00:17:00,139
(Kiss the crocodile.)

400
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,740
This is your chance.

401
00:17:02,408 --> 00:17:04,443
Chopper is doing everything he can...

402
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:06,312
to save Kwang Soo's part.

403
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,383
(Give me a kiss.)

404
00:17:12,785 --> 00:17:15,854
(I can't kiss him!)

405
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,290
The cage is broken.

406
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:24,763
(Scared, Kwang Soo steps back.)

407
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:26,332
This is your chance. Kiss him.

408
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:27,933
(Do it now.)

409
00:17:27,933 --> 00:17:29,101
Way to go.

410
00:17:29,401 --> 00:17:30,469
Kiss him.

411
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,205
- They're kissing. - He's close.

412
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,074
(Chopper sticks his mouth out.)

413
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:38,944
(Will Kwang Soo stick his mouth out too?)

414
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:42,681
(Chopper is so close.)

415
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:48,387
(His smile intimidates Kwang Soo.)

416
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:49,988
It's too close.

417
00:17:50,556 --> 00:17:51,690
It's too close.

418
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:57,363
(Their mouths get close.)

419
00:17:57,396 --> 00:18:00,566
(Kwang Soo and Chopper kiss.)

420
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:01,900
It's so close.

421
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,669
(They kissed.)

422
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,071
Like in "Free Willy",

423
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:08,307
- he's communicating... - Communication with a crocodile.

424
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:11,176
with a crocodile. The boy has grown up.

425
00:18:11,176 --> 00:18:12,277
(Romance with a crocodile)

426
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:13,579
He's communicating with a crocodile.

427
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:17,216
Was "Free Willy" about...

428
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,785
- A dolphin in a zoo... - A turtle?

429
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:21,620
- What? - A dolphin?

430
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:23,756
(That was close.)

431
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:26,959
(The crocodile boy comes back.)

432
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,194
- He's here. - Kwang Soo.

433
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,698
It was scary, wasn't it?

434
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:35,534
- It's huge. - It's big, right?

435
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,770
Chopper seemed to like you.

436
00:18:38,203 --> 00:18:40,506
- Yes. - He didn't want to leave you.

437
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:41,774
He stayed nearby the whole time.

438
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:43,942
After you left, it went away.

439
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,111
(I love you, Kwang Soo.)

440
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,713
Anyway,

441
00:18:47,713 --> 00:18:50,215
you've completed the Cage of Death penalty in Australia.

442
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,384
(Cage of Death is completed.)

443
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:54,586
- Good work. - Let's go now.

444
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:55,754
- We did it. - Congratulations.

445
00:18:55,754 --> 00:18:57,423
You're the only one who didn't get penalized.

446
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:00,793
- The penalty is completed. - Yes.

447
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:03,896
It's time to decide what to do with the remaining Chance Cards.

448
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,197
It's important.

449
00:19:05,197 --> 00:19:07,733
- Are there more? - Yes.

450
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,001
There are two more.

451
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,035
("We will do..." and "We won't go...")

452
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:12,104
Yesterday, we picked a positive one...

453
00:19:12,104 --> 00:19:14,039
- "We won't go..." - We picked "We will go..."

454
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,008
We picked "We will go..." and one more got penalized.

455
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,977
- Wouldn't "We won't go..." be good? - I think I know.

456
00:19:18,977 --> 00:19:20,045
What?

457
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,247
"We will do..." must be...

458
00:19:22,247 --> 00:19:25,150
"We will do it one more time."

459
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,552
Probably.

460
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:28,053
- You're probably right. - It makes sense.

461
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:31,623
"We won't go..."

462
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,858
- "get penalized again." - "Get penalized again."

463
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,893
(We won't get penalized again.)

464
00:19:34,893 --> 00:19:36,295
What if it's, "We won't go home?"

465
00:19:36,295 --> 00:19:38,497
- No way. - It wouldn't make sense.

466
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:39,965
- You've made a choice. - Yes.

467
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:41,834
You can choose not to use it too.

468
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:43,368
- Well... - We'll use it.

469
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:45,804
We should. "We will go..." was a bad one.

470
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:46,972
- Exactly. - This one must be a good one.

471
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:48,373
If we don't use it, the whole things is pointless.

472
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:49,475
- You want to use it? - Yes.

473
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:51,076
I don't want to use it.

474
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:53,712
Please open it.

475
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:55,547
- So Min. - There are two lines.

476
00:19:55,547 --> 00:19:58,884
- Yesterday, we picked a positive... - Exactly.

477
00:19:58,884 --> 00:19:59,985
Both of them might be bad.

478
00:19:59,985 --> 00:20:02,287
(Their last choice made Seok Jin get penalized.)

479
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:04,323
Yesterday, we picked a positive one,

480
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:05,624
- Exactly. - and it turned out to be a bad one.

481
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,059
It was a bad one.

482
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:08,327
Both of them might be bad.

483
00:20:08,327 --> 00:20:09,761
"Another..."

484
00:20:09,761 --> 00:20:10,796
(Another penalty)

485
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:13,298
(We won't go receive another penalty?)

486
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:14,466
Okay!

487
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:15,667
- "Another penalty..." - "Another penalty..."

488
00:20:16,468 --> 00:20:17,503
Okay!

489
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:18,837
- There's another line. - "We won't go..."

490
00:20:18,837 --> 00:20:20,706
"receive another penalty."

491
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:22,441
(What is the other line?)

492
00:20:22,441 --> 00:20:23,942
There's another line.

493
00:20:23,942 --> 00:20:25,511
- Let's see. - "Another penalty..."

494
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:29,014
"We won't go home..."

495
00:20:29,014 --> 00:20:33,785
(We won't go home before we receive another penalty.)

496
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:35,420
"Before we receive..."

497
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,260
- He's crazy. - Are you kidding us?

498
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,862
(Our producer is crazy.)

499
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,765
- Are you kidding us? - What is this?

500
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:49,234
- What are you doing? - We just celebrated.

501
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:50,602
What are you doing?

502
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:53,038
- All of them are bad, aren't they? - Hold on.

503
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:54,873
- Tell us the truth. - What is this?

504
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,809
You picked the worst one.

505
00:20:57,809 --> 00:20:59,611
- How can we be sure it's true? - What are you doing?

506
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:03,515
If the other team had picked it, they would have tried Nevis Bungee.

507
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:04,616
What?

508
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:10,255
(Nevis Bungee is bungee jumping off a cliff.)

509
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:13,358
Let me tell you what penalty you'll receive.

510
00:21:13,358 --> 00:21:14,893
This time, there's no cage.

511
00:21:14,893 --> 00:21:16,728
You'll get to see wild crocodiles close up.

512
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,997
It's wild crocodile experience.

513
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:20,365
(Wild crocodile experience)

514
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:22,134
He's crazy.

515
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,268
(Wild crocodiles?)

516
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:24,503
- Wild crocodiles? - You're crazy.

517
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:25,571
You're crazy.

518
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,539
- Will you stop... - You're overzealous.

519
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:29,241
if someone gets hurt?

520
00:21:29,241 --> 00:21:30,809
You could have chosen not to use the card.

521
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:32,511
It was your choice.

522
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:33,812
It was either "We will go..." or "We won't go..."

523
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,547
We chose a negative one today.

524
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,549
- It should have been a good one. - Yes.

525
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:40,085
- You said there was a good one. - It was your choice.

526
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:41,520
The other team took more.

527
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,255
They were the ones you won.

528
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:45,023
I mean... Listen.

529
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,825
- How could you say that? - Gosh.

530
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:49,294
- You're evil. - He's crazy.

531
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:51,563
We won't go home before we do it?

532
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:53,031
I have to go home.

533
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,333
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

534
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,234
If none of you show...

535
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,269
the same thing as I show, you can go home.

536
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,270
(They'll play rock-paper-scissors.)

537
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,838
- That doesn't make sense. - That doesn't make sense.

538
00:21:59,972 --> 00:22:02,741
- Wait. It can be possible. - It can be.

539
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:06,211
Why do you take his side?

540
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:07,713
We could all show the same thing.

541
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:09,615
Do you want to try?

542
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,183
You win if none of you show the same thing as I show.

543
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:14,119
- Okay. - Don't give a signal.

544
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,555
- So Min. - It was so obvious.

545
00:22:16,555 --> 00:22:20,325
(So Min is bad at doing something secretly.)

546
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,893
- Are you ready? - Yes.

547
00:22:21,893 --> 00:22:22,995
- Rock... - Rock...

548
00:22:22,995 --> 00:22:24,863
(They might have to see wild crocodiles.)

549
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:26,298
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

550
00:22:26,365 --> 00:22:28,433
Wild crocodile experience.

551
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:32,304
(Will they escape their bad luck?)

552
00:22:32,304 --> 00:22:33,538
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

553
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:38,010
(All of them show scissors.)

554
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:41,179
- Gosh. - Unbelievable.

555
00:22:41,313 --> 00:22:43,782
- I can't believe it. - It's impossible.

556
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:45,584
Let's go.

557
00:22:46,051 --> 00:22:47,886
We already saw the crocodiles.

558
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,054
(They have to see wild crocodiles.)

559
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:52,024
(Meanwhile, in New Zealand,)

560
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:55,460
(D-Day is here, and it's a beautiful weather.)

561
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,062
Beautiful weather.

562
00:22:57,396 --> 00:22:59,798
It's perfect for Nevis Swing.

563
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,200
Look at that.

564
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,836
Even the weather is nice.

565
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,171
It's New Zealand.

566
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,240
We'll have to go on Nevis Swing.

567
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,441
(They have no choice.)

568
00:23:09,808 --> 00:23:10,842
(The sky is so clear.)

569
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:12,611
I was hoping for heavy rain.

570
00:23:13,378 --> 00:23:15,113
Haha didn't get any sleep.

571
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:16,214
I did.

572
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:18,383
- He had a nightmare. - Really?

573
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:20,218
He was solving problems.

574
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:21,953
He was on a quiz show.

575
00:23:21,953 --> 00:23:23,455
And he couldn't solve anything.

576
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:24,790
(He couldn't solve any problems on a quiz show.)

577
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,160
It's no surprise, is it?

578
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:30,095
It's not a nightmare.

579
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:31,096
(It's just like in reality.)

580
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:32,364
It's...

581
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:34,299
Man.

582
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:36,802
Is this the LA weather or the New Zealand weather?

583
00:23:37,135 --> 00:23:40,372
It's the LA weather plus the New Zealand weather.

584
00:23:40,372 --> 00:23:41,573
- What's that? - What?

585
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,208
- What's that? - What's that?

586
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,643
- What's that? - What?

587
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,345
We should have breakfast.

588
00:23:47,345 --> 00:23:49,614
It's good for your health.

589
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:50,682
- Really? - Try it.

590
00:23:51,283 --> 00:23:52,984
- What's this? - What?

591
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:54,753
- "Diet water jelly"? - "Diet water jelly"?

592
00:23:54,953 --> 00:23:58,056
It helps lose weight,

593
00:23:58,256 --> 00:23:59,558
but it's also a nice breakfast.

594
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:01,026
You often skip breakfast.

595
00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:02,127
I don't.

596
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:03,328
- You guys skip it. - Right.

597
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,863
Drink this every morning.

598
00:24:04,863 --> 00:24:05,964
- Hey. - It's good.

599
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:07,933
If you drink it,

600
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,534
- you'll be full. - I'm full.

601
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,203
It's a nice start of the day.

602
00:24:11,503 --> 00:24:13,739
All right. As I said yesterday,

603
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:16,508
you can win a Chance Card by completing a mission.

604
00:24:16,508 --> 00:24:19,077
It's a swing dance mission.

605
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:20,846
(Swing dance in Queenstown)

606
00:24:21,313 --> 00:24:24,049
(The mission for the last Chance Card begins.)

607
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,753
(They have to attract 30 people within the given time.)

608
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:31,123
(They do their best to attract the audience.)

609
00:24:31,456 --> 00:24:34,459
(They use all the skills they have.)

610
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:37,596
(The mission is accomplished.)

611
00:24:38,463 --> 00:24:39,531
Thank you.

612
00:24:39,998 --> 00:24:41,333
- Guys. - Yes.

613
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,034
You'll choose a Chance Card.

614
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,036
There are two left.

615
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,940
One is very good,

616
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,109
and the other is very bad.

617
00:24:51,877 --> 00:24:54,813
("We will receive..." and "We won't receive...")

618
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:57,149
Okay. "We will receive..." would be better.

619
00:24:57,149 --> 00:24:58,984
- Should we start with this one? - This is it.

620
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,085
No.

621
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:01,286
We choose this one.

622
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:02,354
- Have you decided? - Yes.

623
00:25:02,354 --> 00:25:04,623
Would you like to use the card?

624
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:05,791
- Yes. - Yes.

625
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:08,026
Take a look at the Chance Card.

626
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:11,530
(They worked hard to win the last Chance Card.)

627
00:25:11,663 --> 00:25:13,031
- "One of the penalized..." - What is it?

628
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:15,000
(One of the penalized will not...)

629
00:25:16,034 --> 00:25:17,235
(What will happen to one of us?)

630
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,104
Please, just this once.

631
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,305
(It could be an exemption from Nevis Swing.)

632
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,373
Just this once.

633
00:25:21,807 --> 00:25:23,308
(What does it say below?)

634
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:24,409
What?

635
00:25:24,876 --> 00:25:25,977
"One will not be penalized."

636
00:25:25,977 --> 00:25:27,913
(One of them will not be penalized.)

637
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,448
"One will not be penalized." Thank you.

638
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:32,284
- Thank you. I was voted. - What?

639
00:25:32,284 --> 00:25:33,285
(One of them is exempt from Nevis Swing.)

640
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:34,352
That's amazing.

641
00:25:35,153 --> 00:25:38,123
Seriously. Please save me once, Ji Hyo.

642
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:40,325
We don't know whom it will be.

643
00:25:40,325 --> 00:25:41,393
It could be me.

644
00:25:41,393 --> 00:25:43,295
(He makes a shocking comment.)

645
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:46,298
That's true, but everyone else is brave.

646
00:25:46,298 --> 00:25:47,299
- No. - Gosh.

647
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,501
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's do that.

648
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,536
Let's do it up here.

649
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:53,238
Right.

650
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,307
- This is how Running Man works. - Yes.

651
00:25:55,307 --> 00:25:57,042
- That's right. - You have to earn it.

652
00:25:57,108 --> 00:25:58,443
- Okay. - Let's go.

653
00:25:58,443 --> 00:26:00,111
This is how Running Man works.

654
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,848
- Can we decide up there? - Yes.

655
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:05,650
The member to be exempted...

656
00:26:05,884 --> 00:26:07,586
(They head to Nevis Swing.)

657
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,653
What do I do?

658
00:26:08,787 --> 00:26:11,690
It feels real now, Haha.

659
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:13,925
(Sighing)

660
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,361
We're ascending far.

661
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:17,596
(40-minute drive from Queenstown)

662
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:20,298
40 minutes of hiking is very high from the ground.

663
00:26:20,532 --> 00:26:22,434
- Right. - This is 40 minutes of driving.

664
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:24,970
We're going up to the peak.

665
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,305
This is confusing because...

666
00:26:27,305 --> 00:26:30,075
the view around us is beautiful.

667
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:31,309
When you think about riding the swing?

668
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,846
When I think about that, I'm angry and scared.

669
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:35,914
(Thinking of the destination makes him furious.)

670
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,083
(Haha has 17 years of experience in entertainment.)

671
00:26:38,083 --> 00:26:40,952
(This is his fatal weakness in entertainment.)

672
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,522
(He's the biggest coward.)

673
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:46,524
(When he goes somewhere risky,)

674
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:49,494
(half of his comments can't be aired.)

675
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,229
(He hasn't gotten over...)

676
00:26:51,229 --> 00:26:53,598
(his fear for extreme rides.)

677
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,002
(It's the most difficult moment of his 17 years in this industry.)

678
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:59,337
Nevis Swing sounds fun, doesn't it?

679
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:02,374
(He teases Haha.)

680
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:05,377
Imagine hanging in the air.

681
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,345
- Walk in the air. - He's a penalty destroyer.

682
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:10,582
Imagine sitting while hanging in the air.

683
00:27:10,582 --> 00:27:14,452
There's a view of a cliff in front of you.

684
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,455
You're hanging in the air, and the seat is unsteady.

685
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:19,391
The seat keeps moving.

686
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:22,861
You never know when you'll fall. Three.

687
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:25,196
- 2, 1. - 2, 1.

688
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:26,264
Do you know what I mean?

689
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:27,832
My goodness.

690
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:29,134
Do you know the feeling?

691
00:27:29,134 --> 00:27:30,535
- Stop it. - You fall suddenly.

692
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:31,603
Stop it, Jong Kook.

693
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:34,172
You hear the wind while you fall.

694
00:27:34,806 --> 00:27:36,141
Stop it!

695
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,843
(Stop it, darn it.)

696
00:27:38,843 --> 00:27:40,211
Are you making sound effects?

697
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:42,347
It's like the IMAX theater.

698
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:44,115
(Is this a nightmare with sound effects?)

699
00:27:44,115 --> 00:27:45,550
I can imagine it.

700
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,651
(He's wearing 3-D glasses.)

701
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:48,320
I can imagine it.

702
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:49,821
It's terrible.

703
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,890
I'm breaking out in a cold sweat.

704
00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:53,692
I can't breathe.

705
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:56,361
Then you should yawn.

706
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,596
(He expresses his concern for him.)

707
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:01,199
Then your brain gets some oxygen.

708
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:02,801
(What kind of advice is that?)

709
00:28:05,203 --> 00:28:06,204
Try yawning.

710
00:28:06,204 --> 00:28:07,305
(He encourages him.)

711
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:08,440
Start.

712
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:11,209
Come on and yawn. Go.

713
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:12,377
(Yawning)

714
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,613
Breathe oxygen into your brain. Go.

715
00:28:15,814 --> 00:28:18,350
(Will this help him a little?)

716
00:28:19,017 --> 00:28:21,152
Look at the trees. Aren't they amazing?

717
00:28:21,152 --> 00:28:22,354
(He breathes in during the ride.)

718
00:28:22,354 --> 00:28:23,955
Haha is so funny.

719
00:28:24,322 --> 00:28:25,623
- Are we here? - Where is it?

720
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:27,559
- We're almost there. - Really?

721
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:29,527
- I don't see the swing. - We have to go up higher.

722
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:31,529
We'll ascend in another vehicle.

723
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,064
It's an off-road vehicle.

724
00:28:33,064 --> 00:28:34,733
It's an SUV, Haha's favorite.

725
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,102
- We'll go up in a 4WD. - Yes.

726
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,374
(He makes an engine sound.)

727
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:44,542
(Stop it, you punk.)

728
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:46,611
Se Chan might get hit today.

729
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:48,513
He's my partner, Ji Hyo.

730
00:28:48,513 --> 00:28:50,015
I'll take care of him.

731
00:28:50,015 --> 00:28:51,082
(Otherwise, he might cry.)

732
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:55,153
- Gosh, we're really going. - Goodness.

733
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:56,187
Let's go.

734
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,027
I was so nervous in the van.

735
00:29:02,093 --> 00:29:03,862
Give him something to calm down.

736
00:29:08,366 --> 00:29:10,435
(The staff members give him medicine to calm him down.)

737
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,170
Gosh, look at that.

738
00:29:12,337 --> 00:29:14,372
What? Seriously.

739
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:15,940
(Haha remains silent.)

740
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:18,209
Fully enjoy the taste.

741
00:29:18,576 --> 00:29:19,611
Breathe in at the same time.

742
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:21,613
(Enjoy the taste while breathing in.)

743
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:24,115
Make yourself yawn like this.

744
00:29:24,115 --> 00:29:25,250
Stop it.

745
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:27,085
Get away.

746
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,288
You're on my team, Haha.

747
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:31,790
We're here for you.

748
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,992
Look at the dandelion seeds.

749
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:36,394
- Look at him. - Jong Kook is here too.

750
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:37,929
He came here to play.

751
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:44,069
(Standing among dandelion seeds in the air,)

752
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:47,372
(Jong Kook enjoys the beautiful nature.)

753
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,541
(Look at the sky, Haha.)

754
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,644
(The way to Nevis Swing is beautiful.)

755
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:55,847
(He's so happy.)

756
00:29:56,548 --> 00:30:00,351
(If only I were a good fighter...)

757
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,520
(He gulps down water.)

758
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,389
(After waiting for 5 minutes...)

759
00:30:04,756 --> 00:30:06,257
The car is here. Let's go.

760
00:30:06,257 --> 00:30:07,659
Let's hurry and finish the shoot.

761
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:08,960
Let's get it.

762
00:30:09,094 --> 00:30:10,462
(Laughing)

763
00:30:10,462 --> 00:30:12,297
You make me feel reassured...

764
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,631
- Let's go. - a little.

765
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:14,833
- Let's go. - Let's go now.

766
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:15,834
He's passionate.

767
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,502
(They head to Nevis Swing.)

768
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:21,873
(The off-road vehicle moves unsteadily.)

769
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:24,075
The ride feels great.

770
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:25,510
It's so unsteady.

771
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,112
(They start to feel it.)

772
00:30:27,245 --> 00:30:30,115
It's how it feels whenever we head to a scary ride.

773
00:30:30,582 --> 00:30:31,649
Goodness.

774
00:30:31,783 --> 00:30:35,653
- Yes! - Yes, man!

775
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,057
(Jong Kook shoots a travel show by himself.)

776
00:30:39,224 --> 00:30:40,458
Remember to breathe, Haha.

777
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:42,460
- Yawn. - You should yawn.

778
00:30:44,896 --> 00:30:46,197
(Sighing)

779
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:47,832
It helps you.

780
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:49,868
Remember that brain lacks in your oxygen.

781
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:51,703
(Yawning can help.)

782
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:52,937
Keep yawning.

783
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:54,806
Did you say, "brain lacks in your oxygen"?

784
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:56,040
You mean the brain lacks oxygen.

785
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,510
He was too nervous.

786
00:30:58,643 --> 00:31:01,779
Are you nervous?

787
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:03,781
- Are you nervous? - He must be.

788
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:06,518
- I'm scared too. - That's why he keeps repeating.

789
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:08,453
He said, "brain lacks in your oxygen."

790
00:31:08,586 --> 00:31:10,455
- Goodness. - I'm scared too, Haha.

791
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:13,358
Stop showing me how scared you are.

792
00:31:13,358 --> 00:31:14,459
Okay.

793
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:16,427
- I'll use a Chance Card. - This is great.

794
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:19,030
Once we climb up the road, you'll find Nevis Swing.

795
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,031
Which road?

796
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:21,199
The road over there.

797
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,302
(The road gets rougher.)

798
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:26,004
It vibrates a lot.

799
00:31:26,804 --> 00:31:27,872
Goodness.

800
00:31:27,939 --> 00:31:31,543
It looks scary on your left side. Don't look.

801
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:32,644
(It's the edge of a cliff on the left.)

802
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,846
- Don't look, Haha. - It's really scary.

803
00:31:35,413 --> 00:31:36,447
If you fall...

804
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,184
Be quiet.

805
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,886
Keep breathing.

806
00:31:41,886 --> 00:31:42,887
(Let's stay calm.)

807
00:31:42,887 --> 00:31:44,522
That must be it.

808
00:31:46,191 --> 00:31:50,795
(He screams in shock.)

809
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:51,796
That's incredible.

810
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:52,864
(Incredible)

811
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:55,567
Look, Haha.

812
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,101
That's it.

813
00:31:57,101 --> 00:31:59,671
(What did they see?)

814
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:04,609
(Welcome to Nevis Swing.)

815
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:09,480
(It's the biggest and the worst swing in the world.)

816
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:14,586
(Highest speed of 125km per hour, 160m in height, 300m in trajectory)

817
00:32:14,786 --> 00:32:17,388
(It's the marvelous Nevis Swing.)

818
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,123
Haha.

819
00:32:19,123 --> 00:32:21,593
(He's speechless.)

820
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,828
I saw it, Haha.

821
00:32:23,995 --> 00:32:26,164
- This must be it. - It's incredible.

822
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:27,699
My goodness.

823
00:32:28,533 --> 00:32:29,601
My gosh.

824
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:30,668
Keep breathing.

825
00:32:30,935 --> 00:32:32,937
(He's lost for words.)

826
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:33,938
Yawn.

827
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:36,374
(He keeps suggesting him to yawn.)

828
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:39,344
Don't cover your face. You can't inhale properly.

829
00:32:39,344 --> 00:32:41,679
Do this as you inhale.

830
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:43,014
This is insane.

831
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:44,515
Your hand is sweaty.

832
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:45,516
(What's going on with you?)

833
00:32:45,516 --> 00:32:47,285
- His hand is sweaty. - I'm sorry.

834
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,387
Give him some medicine.

835
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:50,655
(He needs to calm down.)

836
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:54,058
- Can you give me some? - He can't do it.

837
00:32:54,058 --> 00:32:56,628
He can't ride the swing now. Otherwise, he'll die.

838
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:59,464
(Nevis Swing looks more frightening in real life.)

839
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:02,000
I have to go to the restroom.

840
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,335
Excuse me, where's the toilet?

841
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:05,603
(He goes directly to the restroom.)

842
00:33:05,603 --> 00:33:07,305
- Here it is. - Is that it?

843
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:10,842
Even the restroom sign looks scary.

844
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:13,244
- Look at the sign. - It's a man falling.

845
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:14,345
He's falling.

846
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:16,547
I'm going in.

847
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:18,383
(They go into the restroom.)

848
00:33:18,383 --> 00:33:20,285
I don't think I can go on the ride.

849
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,519
It's okay, Haha.

850
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,887
- Can you do it? - You startled me.

851
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,088
(Se Chan comforts Haha.)

852
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,590
What's going on?

853
00:33:25,623 --> 00:33:28,293
Se Chan is throwing up.

854
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:30,595
(He laughs at Se Chan who's throwing up.)

855
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,298
Se Chan.

856
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:34,399
(Vomiting)

857
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:37,335
(He kept suggesting to yawn.)

858
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:39,537
(His nose gets runny.)

859
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,773
I suddenly felt nauseous. Haha?

860
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:47,045
Goodness.

861
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:48,846
(He takes some medicine.)

862
00:33:49,614 --> 00:33:52,150
(I'm usually not a coward.)

863
00:33:53,251 --> 00:33:54,352
What are you eating, Se Chan?

864
00:33:55,386 --> 00:33:57,021
I'm eating some candy.

865
00:33:58,356 --> 00:33:59,424
You should yawn.

866
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:01,259
Yawn.

867
00:34:01,526 --> 00:34:02,593
(Yawning)

868
00:34:05,196 --> 00:34:06,798
I'm being serious.

869
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:08,199
(He pretends not to be a coward.)

870
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,367
What's going on with me?

871
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:13,504
I definitely practiced breathing, right?

872
00:34:14,605 --> 00:34:16,741
Acting brave doesn't fit you.

873
00:34:16,741 --> 00:34:17,809
(Now, they know.)

874
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:20,445
Why did you message me...

875
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:22,914
to say that you can do it?

876
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:24,582
(Se Chan sent him a video to encourage him.)

877
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:26,617
Haha, you can do it.

878
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:29,354
You're the hero in our hearts.

879
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:31,189
Haha.

880
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:32,724
- You can do it. - You can do it.

881
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:37,795
- Leader of Mapo. - Leader of Mapo.

882
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:40,465
(You can do it, Haha.)

883
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:43,935
(How dare you tease me?)

884
00:34:43,935 --> 00:34:45,069
What will you do?

885
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:46,571
We came all the way here.

886
00:34:49,307 --> 00:34:50,942
(Ji Hyo appears with a camera.)

887
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:53,311
What is that?

888
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:55,847
(His eyes are already red.)

889
00:34:55,847 --> 00:34:57,515
- Ji Hyo. - You startled me.

890
00:34:57,582 --> 00:35:00,051
Inside the building,

891
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:04,088
there's a surveillance camera.

892
00:35:04,322 --> 00:35:06,791
I took a look, and it looks really scary.

893
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:09,160
(Even Ji Hyo, who doesn't get scared easily, feels nervous.)

894
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,863
He's enjoying the trip alone again. My gosh, there he goes again.

895
00:35:12,897 --> 00:35:15,032
(Jong Kook's "Backpack Travels")

896
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:18,369
I think the scenery here is very beautiful.

897
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,138
I don't even want to look at him.

898
00:35:20,138 --> 00:35:22,640
My gosh. He's trying to show off his English.

899
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,175
You should just live here.

900
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:26,611
I'm from the United Kingdom.

901
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:27,845
- Really? - So...

902
00:35:27,912 --> 00:35:30,014
- "Really"? Unbelievable. - Hey.

903
00:35:30,014 --> 00:35:32,350
Hey, Hothead. Come here. Hey.

904
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:35,153
- Don't call him. Don't do that. - Should I stop?

905
00:35:35,653 --> 00:35:37,889
- He's not here to meet people. - Yes, that's right.

906
00:35:38,256 --> 00:35:39,323
Give me a minute.

907
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:41,259
- Don't worry. Don't. - Okay.

908
00:35:41,292 --> 00:35:42,393
I shouldn't worry.

909
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,128
(Haha ventures out to stop this international blind date.)

910
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:46,130
I drove away like crazy.

911
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:47,632
I had such a great time.

912
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:50,835
- These two guys are... - Hi.

913
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:52,170
- really scared. - I'm Paris.

914
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,471
- You're Paris? - Yes.

915
00:35:53,471 --> 00:35:56,941
(He's about to deliver his punch line after the introduction.)

916
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,210
It's nice to meet you.

917
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,244
Where's the toilet?

918
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,480
(I need to pee.)

919
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,148
(He's blunt and isn't shy at all.)

920
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,483
Show him the toilet, please.

921
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:08,085
- Thank you. - What's going on with Haha?

922
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,188
(After Haha visits the toilet for the fourth time,)

923
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:13,524
(they are fully ready to ride Nevis Swing.)

924
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:16,394
(Meanwhile, in Australia...)

925
00:36:16,394 --> 00:36:17,795
- Where are we now? - I see eagles.

926
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:18,796
- Is this another... - Where are we?

927
00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:20,898
- What are we doing here? - They are eagles.

928
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:22,834
- Aren't they eagles? - They are hawks.

929
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,602
- They are hawks. - Seriously? They're hawks?

930
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:26,838
This feels different.

931
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,606
- Where on earth are we now? - Where are we?

932
00:36:28,973 --> 00:36:30,708
That's a river. It's a river.

933
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,210
My gosh, this place...

934
00:36:32,944 --> 00:36:34,312
I guess we're going by boat.

935
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:35,546
What are we doing?

936
00:36:36,214 --> 00:36:37,515
Hey, hey, everyone.

937
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,250
- Hi. - Hi.

938
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,818
- This is the thing, right? - Yes?

939
00:36:40,818 --> 00:36:42,220
- Yes. - Are you the crocodile's food?

940
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:43,521
- What? - What did he say?

941
00:36:43,521 --> 00:36:44,856
He asked if we were the feed for the crocodile.

942
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:46,791
(They are terrified.)

943
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:47,792
No.

944
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,360
- Are we the crocodile's food? - Yes.

945
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,262
- No, we are not. - You look tasty.

946
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:52,563
- No. - No.

947
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:54,732
(He's joking.)

948
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,935
My name is Tony. Welcome to Crocodylus Park.

949
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:00,471
You guys are here to help me feed some crocodiles today.

950
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:01,606
- We didn't hear... - Yes.

951
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:02,940
We are going to feed the crocodiles?

952
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,675
(It's news to him.)

953
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:08,479
You won't be in a cage this time. You'll ride the boat...

954
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,882
to meet the wild crocodiles in person.

955
00:37:10,882 --> 00:37:12,383
- What did you say? - It's such a special place.

956
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:14,185
(Welcome to the tour of wild crocodiles.)

957
00:37:14,185 --> 00:37:16,954
- When did we say we'll feed them? - They haven't eaten anything, no?

958
00:37:16,954 --> 00:37:20,625
(There are basks of crocodiles that are desperate for their meals.)

959
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:22,460
- It's here. It's here! - Where?

960
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,061
(Looking vicious)

961
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:27,899
However, one of you must personally feed the crocodiles.

962
00:37:27,899 --> 00:37:29,400
When the crocodile jumps to eat its food,

963
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,969
the other members will try to take a selfie with the crocodile.

964
00:37:32,904 --> 00:37:34,539
- He's talking gibberish. - Look at this guy.

965
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:37,708
- You are one nasty producer. - Everyone's face must be visible.

966
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:41,812
(Faces of 4 members including the crocodile's must be in the photo.)

967
00:37:41,812 --> 00:37:42,813
Right now,

968
00:37:42,813 --> 00:37:44,815
this mission is harder than the penalty we just faced...

969
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,584
- over the last three weeks. - Hold on a second.

970
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:47,685
One of us has to feed the crocodile.

971
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,787
- When we feed the crocodile... - We must do it when it jumps.

972
00:37:49,787 --> 00:37:52,256
He wants them to explain because he's planning to do this mission.

973
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,491
Seok Jin, get out of here.

974
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,126
You're on their side. Get away from us.

975
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:58,162
- Just trust me. - This is unbelievable.

976
00:37:58,162 --> 00:38:00,865
He's such a traitor.

977
00:38:00,898 --> 00:38:02,967
It's going to be a great clip. I can't wait to try this.

978
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:04,435
We already tried this ourselves.

979
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:05,670
Our staff tried to take a selfie...

980
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,238
- when it jumped. - Does it actually jump?

981
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:08,706
Wait. That's why...

982
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,207
one of the staff members is missing.

983
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:11,709
(This just got a whole lot scarier.)

984
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,110
(Why are there less staff members?)

985
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,212
- What you're saying is terrifying. - I don't see one of them.

986
00:38:15,212 --> 00:38:16,213
I don't see the staff member.

987
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,316
As long as you don't stick your head or hands,

988
00:38:18,316 --> 00:38:20,284
- they say it's safe. - Who doesn't know that?

989
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:22,520
If you follow the instructions well, it will be a great experience.

990
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,690
The crocodiles don't jump into the boat?

991
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,959
Can crocodiles come inside?

992
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,995
If you come with me, we'll feed them and make them jump,

993
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:33,497
and you guys would have to collect the crocodiles' eggs...

994
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:34,832
- from the nest. - Okay. Goodness.

995
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:36,067
(His response is late.)

996
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,269
What he said had nothing to do with your question.

997
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:40,171
They are talking about two different things.

998
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:41,939
They can't communicate with each other.

999
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:44,308
- When we try, will they jump? - "Try".

1000
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:46,177
- Yes. - They'll jump?

1001
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,745
Do they jump into the boat?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1002
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:48,980
I'll be in the boat too.

1003
00:38:49,046 --> 00:38:50,314
And then, we'll head over there.

1004
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:51,649
- They will jump into the boat. - In that case,

1005
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:53,417
we should turn off the engine.

1006
00:38:53,584 --> 00:38:55,086
They are talking about two different things.

1007
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:56,921
What are you saying?

1008
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,089
(He's frustrated.)

1009
00:38:58,289 --> 00:38:59,523
(I'll smile and pretend I got it.)

1010
00:38:59,523 --> 00:39:00,725
- Okay. - Okay. Let's go.

1011
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:02,460
My goodness, this isn't what I was expecting.

1012
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:05,463
- This isn't right. - I don't know if they'll jump.

1013
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:08,766
- Hi. - So we're going to feed them.

1014
00:39:08,766 --> 00:39:11,769
(They walk into the creepy-looking place.)

1015
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,571
This is crazy.

1016
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:14,705
(A tang of fishy smell permeates.)

1017
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,107
So Min, this is no joke.

1018
00:39:16,107 --> 00:39:17,441
I already...

1019
00:39:17,642 --> 00:39:20,378
- smell the spoiled meat they like. - I do too.

1020
00:39:20,378 --> 00:39:22,480
- I can smell it too. - It smells like trout.

1021
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,749
- My gosh, this is... - I smell the fermented fish.

1022
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:27,084
It's a perfect environment for them.

1023
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,186
Look at the color of the water.

1024
00:39:29,186 --> 00:39:30,321
(The swamp has a deep green color.)

1025
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:32,156
- It matches the crocodiles' colors. - Exactly.

1026
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,191
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1027
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:36,961
How many crocodiles live in the swamp?

1028
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,730
40 females and 8 male crocodiles live here.

1029
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:42,099
- They are real crocodiles. - If we fall, we're done for.

1030
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:43,768
If we fall into the water, it's over.

1031
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:45,603
This has a different vibe from the cage.

1032
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:48,005
- This is for Discovery Channel. - Precisely.

1033
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:49,540
- Hey, this is... - It's interesting.

1034
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,409
National Geographic would cover something like this.

1035
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:53,044
It's something I'd see in movies.

1036
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:56,747
Didn't Tarzan fight against a crocodile in somewhere like this?

1037
00:39:56,814 --> 00:39:57,915
Do you know who Tarzan is?

1038
00:39:57,915 --> 00:39:59,717
- This is cool. - It is.

1039
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,519
I feel special.

1040
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,087
(He feels like he's an explorer.)

1041
00:40:03,087 --> 00:40:04,188
Like a giraffe?

1042
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:07,658
Drop it.

1043
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:11,829
At a place like this, impalas are the first ones to die.

1044
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:14,265
(Seok Jin, the impala, is crocodiles' primary prey.)

1045
00:40:14,265 --> 00:40:15,900
- They can die while drinking water. - I'm going to run away.

1046
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,134
I'm going to run away.

1047
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:20,037
- You applied cologne, didn't you? - Pardon?

1048
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:21,806
The smell of cologne in the jungle is...

1049
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:24,642
signaling the animals to attack you.

1050
00:40:24,642 --> 00:40:26,644
Wait. There's a crocodile in the back.

1051
00:40:26,644 --> 00:40:28,012
- Where? - A crocodile is in the back.

1052
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:29,013
- Gosh, you startled me. - It's a crocodile.

1053
00:40:29,013 --> 00:40:30,981
- A crocodile is in the back. - Where?

1054
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,416
(A huge crocodile shows up.)

1055
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,918
- It's a real crocodile. - There's one, indeed.

1056
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:35,753
- I didn't know it could be so big. - It's a crocodile.

1057
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,189
- The trees make it hard to spot. - There is a crocodile here.

1058
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,691
- It's protective coloration. - Yes, it is.

1059
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,927
That's not a rock. It's a crocodile, right?

1060
00:40:43,194 --> 00:40:44,328
It's a crocodile.

1061
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:47,398
I do feel like I'm in Africa.

1062
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:49,800
- Sorry? - It does feel like that.

1063
00:40:49,934 --> 00:40:52,069
This does feel like we're in a jungle.

1064
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,472
- There's one over there too. - Where?

1065
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,606
Up there?

1066
00:40:55,606 --> 00:40:56,607
- There's one. - That one is huge.

1067
00:40:56,607 --> 00:40:58,209
- I don't know if it's real or not. - The left one is massive.

1068
00:40:58,209 --> 00:40:59,443
It's moving.

1069
00:40:59,477 --> 00:41:00,745
- It is moving. - It's going.

1070
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:01,979
It's moving.

1071
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:04,315
I wouldn't know if it's a crocodile or a tree if it doesn't move.

1072
00:41:04,315 --> 00:41:05,916
- It looks just like a tree. - Seriously.

1073
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,351
- It looks identical. - There's another one next to it.

1074
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:09,320
- You'll be done if you sit on it, - There are a lot.

1075
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,622
- mistaking it for a tree. - You bet.

1076
00:41:12,857 --> 00:41:14,792
Seok Jin, you shouldn't spray cologne before coming here.

1077
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:16,761
- We're in a jungle. - Who would sit on that?

1078
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:18,562
- Do you think I'm stupid? - I mean...

1079
00:41:18,562 --> 00:41:20,798
- There are other places to sit on. - Seok Jin.

1080
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:24,068
You're good as dead if you sit on it after wearing cologne.

1081
00:41:24,068 --> 00:41:25,736
- I mean it, Seok Jin. - Who would sit on the crocodile?

1082
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:27,905
- Are there crocodiles underwater? - Yes.

1083
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:30,541
- There are crocodiles at the front. - Where? I can't see.

1084
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,243
- They are under the water. - I see the crocodiles.

1085
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:33,310
It's floating on the water.

1086
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,146
- I can only see its nose. - Its head is sticking out.

1087
00:41:35,146 --> 00:41:36,714
- Don't stick out your head. - It's a crocodile.

1088
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:39,016
Everyone, we'll pull over on the right...

1089
00:41:39,016 --> 00:41:40,851
- so you can collect the eggs. - What?

1090
00:41:41,685 --> 00:41:43,687
- What? - We're going to collect the eggs?

1091
00:41:43,687 --> 00:41:44,989
- Right here? - Yes.

1092
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:47,057
- It's looking at us. - What are you talking about?

1093
00:41:47,057 --> 00:41:48,993
- There's a crocodile over there. - There's a crocodile.

1094
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:50,461
What are you getting at?

1095
00:41:50,461 --> 00:41:51,729
We're going to get off here?

1096
00:41:51,729 --> 00:41:54,064
The zookeeper is going to make sure you are safe.

1097
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:56,233
But the crocodile is staring at us.

1098
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:57,468
I see one over there too.

1099
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,171
- There's another one there. - There are tons here.

1100
00:42:00,337 --> 00:42:02,439
- How will the zookeeper help us? - There's one more.

1101
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,874
There's one more over there.

1102
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:05,209
Here's another one.

1103
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:07,111
They are scattered all over the place.

1104
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:11,081
Only two of you will go and collect the eggs.

1105
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:14,084
- Will the parents let us take them? - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1106
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:15,519
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1107
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:19,023
The winners will stay in the boat, right?

1108
00:42:19,023 --> 00:42:20,191
Let's set the rules first.

1109
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:22,293
- The winners will stay here. - Exactly.

1110
00:42:22,726 --> 00:42:24,795
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are here.

1111
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:25,863
(They're the ultimate unlucky pair.)

1112
00:42:25,863 --> 00:42:27,264
(Eggs must be collected for them to hatch safely.)

1113
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:28,432
Rock-paper-scissors

1114
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:29,633
(Eggs must be collected for them to hatch safely.)

1115
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,839
(Wild crocodiles will be observing the process from somewhere.)

1116
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:37,208
(Which 2 members will get to observe them up close?)

1117
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,442
Rock-paper-scissors

1118
00:42:38,742 --> 00:42:41,712
(What a surprise! Jae Seok and Kwang Soo win!)

1119
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:47,585
(So Min and Seok Jin will collect the eggs.)

1120
00:42:47,685 --> 00:42:49,854
You two may go and collect the eggs now.

1121
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,689
(Seok Jin and So Min will enter the nest of crocodiles.)

1122
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:53,791
Promise me that you won't leave me.

1123
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:54,892
Don't worry about that.

1124
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:56,493
They're taking the poles with them.

1125
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,728
(He's shocked.)

1126
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,296
It must be dangerous here.

1127
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:00,998
The captain must think it's dangerous.

1128
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,032
He brought a pole with him.

1129
00:43:02,032 --> 00:43:04,168
But the thing is that collecting their eggs...

1130
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:06,437
- is such... - The captain...

1131
00:43:06,437 --> 00:43:09,440
- It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance. - Exactly.

1132
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,709
- Actually, I want to try this. - So do I.

1133
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:13,978
I will go into Cage of Death.

1134
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:15,379
(I'll rather go into Cage of Death.)

1135
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:17,748
I will let other members try this since they want to do it.

1136
00:43:17,748 --> 00:43:18,816
I really want to try this.

1137
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:20,684
- Then do you want to come with me? - Sorry?

1138
00:43:20,684 --> 00:43:22,186
- Seok Jin has to go. - Come with us.

1139
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:23,187
Only two of us must try it.

1140
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:24,622
- How about you 2 go for it? - 2 of you must go now.

1141
00:43:24,788 --> 00:43:26,223
Seok Jin, we need to film this,

1142
00:43:26,223 --> 00:43:28,425
so pretend it doesn't hurt if the crocodile bites you.

1143
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,227
- Hey. - Scream when you see...

1144
00:43:30,227 --> 00:43:31,929
- the crocodile. - It'll definitely hurt.

1145
00:43:31,996 --> 00:43:33,264
Hold on.

1146
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:35,165
- We'll go when it's safe. - When it's safe?

1147
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:37,401
- It must be dangerous over there. - I think so too.

1148
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,603
I think things are tense and dangerous.

1149
00:43:39,603 --> 00:43:41,705
Everyone here are flustered.

1150
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,540
Something must've come. It must've shown up.

1151
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,875
- What is it? - They're hitting it.

1152
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:46,610
Look at that. Right now, they are...

1153
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:48,379
- My gosh. - Did you see that?

1154
00:43:48,746 --> 00:43:50,314
You want us to go there?

1155
00:43:50,981 --> 00:43:52,650
You want us to go there?

1156
00:43:53,317 --> 00:43:56,020
I don't think So Min can cross.

1157
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:58,022
- Is it okay? - Okay.

1158
00:43:58,022 --> 00:44:00,758
- Is it safe there? - Up there.

1159
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:03,994
Around the nest. Come this way.

1160
00:44:03,994 --> 00:44:05,195
Thank you.

1161
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:06,997
Okay.

1162
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:08,899
Truth be told, I was scared.

1163
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,501
Jae Seok, they are real crocodiles.

1164
00:44:10,935 --> 00:44:12,069
They are real.

1165
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:14,371
- Hey. - It's no match for haunted houses.

1166
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:15,673
- There's no shelter. - Jae Seok.

1167
00:44:15,673 --> 00:44:17,975
- Labyrinth of Fear is make-believe, - My gosh, this is insane.

1168
00:44:17,975 --> 00:44:19,209
but this is real.

1169
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:21,412
They are real wild crocodiles.

1170
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,514
(This is at another level. This is the real jungle.)

1171
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:24,882
Be careful. Watch out.

1172
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:26,817
Be careful. It's going to start now.

1173
00:44:26,817 --> 00:44:28,619
- What am I going to do? - So Min, crocodiles live here.

1174
00:44:28,852 --> 00:44:30,921
- I'm serious. - Quiet. They might come.

1175
00:44:30,955 --> 00:44:32,122
Okay. I'll be quiet.

1176
00:44:32,122 --> 00:44:33,857
- Don't talk too loudly. - There are no crocodiles?

1177
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:35,793
- Hey, be careful. - Yes.

1178
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:37,294
(This is an entirely different kind of experience.)

1179
00:44:37,294 --> 00:44:38,762
The eggs won't be deep in the forest, right?

1180
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,497
(Can they safely collect the eggs?)

1181
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:43,067
Okay, you guys. This is the nest.

1182
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,269
Right here. You will stay here.

1183
00:44:45,402 --> 00:44:46,937
The eggs are here?

1184
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:49,173
(The eggs are below So Min and Seok Jin's feet.)

1185
00:44:49,173 --> 00:44:50,374
- Right here? - Yes.

1186
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:53,143
The eggs are underneath this?

1187
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:55,379
(This is the nest where the crocodile eggs are kept.)

1188
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:57,548
(The cameraman climbs down to film.)

1189
00:44:57,548 --> 00:44:58,816
- The crocodiles are here. - Hey, hey.

1190
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:01,318
(Hey, no! You can't go down there.)

1191
00:45:01,318 --> 00:45:02,419
Be careful.

1192
00:45:02,419 --> 00:45:03,687
- It's dangerous. - Don't go there.

1193
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:05,589
Don't go near the water.

1194
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:07,725
- There must be crocodiles. - Don't go near the water.

1195
00:45:07,725 --> 00:45:09,626
(The crocodiles might attack you.)

1196
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:11,061
Gosh.

1197
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:12,763
Is this...

1198
00:45:12,763 --> 00:45:14,298
They're guarding the whole place.

1199
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:17,101
- To prevent any danger. - Yes, just in case.

1200
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:19,903
(They're guarding around the nest.)

1201
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:21,438
They're guarding the place.

1202
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:24,775
This is a wild environment.

1203
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,311
If you see here,

1204
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:29,046
they're very delicate.

1205
00:45:30,881 --> 00:45:35,919
(Crocodiles laid eggs in the bush.)

1206
00:45:36,353 --> 00:45:38,522
(Crocodile eggs)

1207
00:45:39,223 --> 00:45:40,224
(There are so many.)

1208
00:45:40,224 --> 00:45:41,291
- Are there eggs? - Yes.

1209
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:42,292
- There are so many. - Are they hatched?

1210
00:45:42,292 --> 00:45:43,560
- No. - Really?

1211
00:45:43,627 --> 00:45:44,728
There are so many.

1212
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:47,164
He's checking the eggs.

1213
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:50,067
He's making sure the eggs will hatch.

1214
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:51,602
(At a low temperature, a female is born.)

1215
00:45:51,602 --> 00:45:52,669
He's taking a temperature.

1216
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:55,172
He's taking a temperature.

1217
00:45:55,973 --> 00:45:57,541
It's 31.5°C.

1218
00:45:57,541 --> 00:45:58,642
(At a high temperature, a male is born.)

1219
00:45:58,642 --> 00:45:59,710
- Is it good? - It's 31°C.

1220
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,744
It's 31°C.

1221
00:46:00,744 --> 00:46:01,912
You don't get to see this often.

1222
00:46:01,912 --> 00:46:04,748
- When will we get to see it again? - We got to see crocodile eggs.

1223
00:46:07,317 --> 00:46:08,919
They're not very big.

1224
00:46:08,919 --> 00:46:10,421
- No bigger than chicken eggs. - Right.

1225
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:12,589
Maybe a bit bigger. They're as big as duck eggs.

1226
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:13,624
How did they lay eggs here?

1227
00:46:13,624 --> 00:46:15,659
Did they cover up the eggs afterwards?

1228
00:46:16,293 --> 00:46:19,396
It's very important that we mark on top of the eggs.

1229
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:20,664
(They draw a line on each egg.)

1230
00:46:20,664 --> 00:46:21,832
We mark them all.

1231
00:46:22,433 --> 00:46:23,700
What does he mean?

1232
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,936
He's drawing on the eggs.

1233
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:27,104
(Why is he doing that?)

1234
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:30,941
- Make sure it doesn't roll. - Okay.

1235
00:46:30,974 --> 00:46:32,109
Okay.

1236
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:33,610
It has to stay this way.

1237
00:46:33,644 --> 00:46:36,380
They make marks to make sure the eggs don't roll.

1238
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,481
I see.

1239
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:39,083
- Interesting. - Very gentle.

1240
00:46:39,183 --> 00:46:40,484
Do you want to try?

1241
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:44,088
- There are so many. - There are so many eggs.

1242
00:46:44,088 --> 00:46:45,422
They laid a lot of eggs.

1243
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:46,957
There are so many.

1244
00:46:46,957 --> 00:46:48,859
(A crocodile lays 15 to 30 eggs at a time.)

1245
00:46:49,493 --> 00:46:51,995
They're going to hatch the eggs in a safer environment, right?

1246
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:53,063
Yes.

1247
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:54,164
(They're trying to hatch the eggs safely.)

1248
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,232
It's big.

1249
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:56,433
Like this.

1250
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:57,835
It's quite heavy.

1251
00:46:57,835 --> 00:46:59,269
(It's heavy.)

1252
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:00,671
You have to be careful.

1253
00:47:00,938 --> 00:47:01,939
It's so interesting.

1254
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:02,940
- Is it cold? - It feels like a ping-pong ball.

1255
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,142
- No. - I think it'll feel warm.

1256
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:06,977
It really feels like a ping-pong ball.

1257
00:47:06,977 --> 00:47:08,712
- It's like a ping-pong ball. - It's like plastic.

1258
00:47:08,812 --> 00:47:10,180
Is it smooth?

1259
00:47:10,581 --> 00:47:12,149
They said it felt like a ping-pong ball.

1260
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,784
You're being sensitive.

1261
00:47:13,784 --> 00:47:16,520
- I was just asking. - They said...

1262
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,522
it was like plastic.

1263
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:21,925
- We're good. Are you all right? - They're coming back.

1264
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:23,827
- Crocodiles are coming. - They're coming back.

1265
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:27,731
(Crocodiles are approaching.)

1266
00:47:28,165 --> 00:47:29,533
Are the parents coming?

1267
00:47:29,533 --> 00:47:31,768
If you don't go near the nest, it'll be all right.

1268
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,972
They're keeping them out by tapping on their heads.

1269
00:47:34,972 --> 00:47:37,207
- Really? - The parents are coming.

1270
00:47:37,207 --> 00:47:38,308
Hurry up, please.

1271
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,043
I feel a bit bad.

1272
00:47:40,244 --> 00:47:42,146
You don't have to. We're trying to...

1273
00:47:42,146 --> 00:47:43,881
Last few. We're almost there.

1274
00:47:44,014 --> 00:47:46,917
They're making sure...

1275
00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:48,952
the eggs hatch safely.

1276
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:53,090
- It's for their safety. - But the parents don't know it.

1277
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,391
- They don't. - No.

1278
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:56,994
But the babies will be released back here, right?

1279
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:59,163
- What if they don't recognize them? - Hold on.

1280
00:47:59,163 --> 00:48:00,430
- Hey. - This doesn't seem right.

1281
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,232
You say that because you don't have your own babies yet.

1282
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:05,502
They will recognize them. What are you saying?

1283
00:48:05,536 --> 00:48:07,171
The babies will look like them. They can recognize their babies.

1284
00:48:07,538 --> 00:48:10,607
(Are you sure?)

1285
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:11,975
I don't think everything will fit in there.

1286
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:14,645
(They cover the eggs with grass.)

1287
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,314
- Okay. Oh, like that. - You cover them up.

1288
00:48:18,382 --> 00:48:19,650
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1289
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,152
- When will we get to do this again? - I'm getting scared.

1290
00:48:22,152 --> 00:48:24,588
This is such a rare experience.

1291
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:25,622
Exactly.

1292
00:48:25,622 --> 00:48:28,792
Engrave this moment to your eyes and heart.

1293
00:48:29,193 --> 00:48:31,662
You were so happy when you won the rock-paper-scissors.

1294
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:34,064
- Who? - You were so happy.

1295
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:35,165
We were being generous.

1296
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:36,400
- You're dealing with lives. - Seriously.

1297
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,602
We gave up on this opportunity...

1298
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:40,070
so you can experience it.

1299
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,538
As if. You were so happy.

1300
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:44,608
- It's the last egg. - Okay.

1301
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:48,579
(They handle the last egg carefully.)

1302
00:48:49,313 --> 00:48:52,482
(They're done collecting the eggs.)

1303
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:54,351
- My goodness. - They're so precious.

1304
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,587
The eggs will hatch...

1305
00:48:56,587 --> 00:48:58,922
in the laboratory.

1306
00:48:58,922 --> 00:48:59,957
Artificially.

1307
00:48:59,957 --> 00:49:03,060
After that, they'll release the babies back here.

1308
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:04,895
After hatching them safely,

1309
00:49:04,895 --> 00:49:06,496
- when they... - With these hands.

1310
00:49:06,496 --> 00:49:07,898
can survive on their own.

1311
00:49:07,998 --> 00:49:10,267
These hands contributed to...

1312
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:11,602
the preservation of crocodiles.

1313
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:12,903
(These hands contributed to the preservation of crocodiles.)

1314
00:49:12,903 --> 00:49:17,040
Do you have your own show or something?

1315
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:20,210
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1316
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,280
You always seem to be shooting something on your own.

1317
00:49:23,914 --> 00:49:24,982
What's with you?

1318
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:30,854
(She shot a show on her own in front of the crocodile cage.)

1319
00:49:30,854 --> 00:49:33,523
(They're onto her.)

1320
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:35,392
Are you shooting a show on your own?

1321
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:37,060
(Did you all see it?)

1322
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,895
Who are you talking to?

1323
00:49:38,895 --> 00:49:40,464
She talks to herself a lot.

1324
00:49:40,631 --> 00:49:42,032
My goodness.

1325
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:44,268
(So Min's show continues.)

1326
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:46,069
It looks...

1327
00:49:46,069 --> 00:49:47,571
It looks like a place...

1328
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:48,905
- from a movie. - It looks like maesaengi soup.

1329
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:50,674
- What? - Maesaengi?

1330
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,110
- There's a crocodile. - It's a big one.

1331
00:49:53,543 --> 00:49:56,380
(A crocodile appeared.)

1332
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:57,547
You see only the head.

1333
00:49:58,148 --> 00:50:00,083
- It's a crocodile. - We're in the wild.

1334
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,084
(A crocodile is looking at their boat.)

1335
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:02,319
How do they jump?

1336
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:06,356
You can feed them whenever you want.

1337
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:08,525
Let me know when you're ready.

1338
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:11,762
Decide who is going to feed them.

1339
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:16,233
It's been decided that So Min will do it.

1340
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,238
(5 minutes before departure)

1341
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:23,874
So Min should do it.

1342
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:25,375
I'll do it.

1343
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:26,877
Be careful. It might eat you.

1344
00:50:27,311 --> 00:50:28,512
Who's going to do it?

1345
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:30,113
So Min.

1346
00:50:30,647 --> 00:50:32,816
(They all say So Min should do it.)

1347
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:34,151
Breathe.

1348
00:50:34,184 --> 00:50:35,786
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

1349
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:39,189
- There's no need to waste time. - Breathe before you answer.

1350
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:41,291
It'd time to feed the crocodiles.

1351
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,627
The zookeeper will demonstrate first.

1352
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:45,228
- It's meat. - It's steak.

1353
00:50:45,562 --> 00:50:46,763
Are you hungry?

1354
00:50:46,763 --> 00:50:48,065
It looks very fresh.

1355
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:49,666
(Prepare food crocodiles like.)

1356
00:50:49,666 --> 00:50:51,201
As we go up here,

1357
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,136
you'll see Popper.

1358
00:50:53,403 --> 00:50:55,605
Put the food out like this.

1359
00:50:55,605 --> 00:50:56,606
(Put the food out as if you are fishing.)

1360
00:50:56,606 --> 00:50:58,208
It looks like he's fishing.

1361
00:50:59,876 --> 00:51:01,011
Watch.

1362
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:03,313
(Attract the crocodile's attention by bouncing the food off the water.)

1363
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,381
And then...

1364
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:05,882
Popper, come on.

1365
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:07,351
- Popper? - Popper.

1366
00:51:07,351 --> 00:51:08,685
- Popper. - Pop.

1367
00:51:08,685 --> 00:51:09,753
(It's called Popper.)

1368
00:51:09,753 --> 00:51:11,355
- Popper. - It pops up.

1369
00:51:11,355 --> 00:51:12,422
Like popcorn.

1370
00:51:13,623 --> 00:51:14,958
- Gosh. - Come on, Popper.

1371
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,760
- It's here. - Where?

1372
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:19,529
(Give me my food.)

1373
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,899
(It pops up just like its name.)

1374
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:25,102
(I can't do that.)

1375
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:30,173
(It snatches the meat.)

1376
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,875
She ate it.

1377
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:35,245
(They see it for the first time.)

1378
00:51:35,245 --> 00:51:36,313
She ate it.

1379
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:37,481
(Fascinating)

1380
00:51:37,781 --> 00:51:40,317
(They break into applause.)

1381
00:51:40,317 --> 00:51:41,852
Now, you guys have to do it.

1382
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,520
- Okay. - Do you want to go first?

1383
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,588
She'll try.

1384
00:51:44,588 --> 00:51:46,123
- Okay. - So Min.

1385
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:47,991
Seriously...

1386
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:49,126
- Do a good job. - When will you get to do it again?

1387
00:51:49,126 --> 00:51:51,061
- You should be honored. - Can you take a picture?

1388
00:51:52,396 --> 00:51:53,997
- That's ribs. - Give it to me.

1389
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:56,066
I'm scared. They'll eat it?

1390
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:57,634
- There's one. - There's one.

1391
00:51:57,701 --> 00:51:59,336
- Look at that. - Over there.

1392
00:51:59,336 --> 00:52:01,972
(They found a crocodile.)

1393
00:52:01,972 --> 00:52:03,874
- Let's get ready. - Let's get ready.

1394
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:08,245
(Both So Min...)

1395
00:52:08,245 --> 00:52:10,313
(and the other members are nervous.)

1396
00:52:10,313 --> 00:52:11,448
Come on.

1397
00:52:11,515 --> 00:52:12,883
Are you taking a selfie?

1398
00:52:12,883 --> 00:52:13,984
- No. - Yummy.

1399
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:15,685
We all have to be in the picture.

1400
00:52:15,685 --> 00:52:16,686
- All of us? - Yes.

1401
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:17,921
- Yes. - Come on.

1402
00:52:18,355 --> 00:52:20,290
- We all have to be in it. - It's not a selfie?

1403
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:22,926
- Where did it go? - Hey.

1404
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:24,995
Are you ready?

1405
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:26,463
- Yes. - It's there.

1406
00:52:26,463 --> 00:52:30,901
(Will they succeed in feeding the crocodile?)

1407
00:52:31,435 --> 00:52:33,136
Her name is Cinderella.

1408
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:35,672
- Cinderella. - Cinderella.

1409
00:52:36,373 --> 00:52:37,941
(She suddenly feels familiar.)

1410
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:39,743
- Cinderella. - Cinderella.

1411
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:41,645
(Will she come close?)

1412
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:43,113
- Cinderella. - I can't see her.

1413
00:52:43,113 --> 00:52:44,748
- It's in the water. - It's coming here.

1414
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:46,883
- Cinderella. - I can't see her.

1415
00:52:46,883 --> 00:52:49,653
(It suddenly disappeared.)

1416
00:52:50,454 --> 00:52:51,588
Dip it.

1417
00:52:51,855 --> 00:52:55,425
(Bubbles)

1418
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:56,993
It's coming.

1419
00:52:56,993 --> 00:52:59,496
- It's there. - I see bubbles.

1420
00:52:59,496 --> 00:53:00,730
(She's approaching.)

1421
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:01,998
- Cinderella. - It's going away.

1422
00:53:01,998 --> 00:53:03,800
Inside there is Casanova.

1423
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:06,903
- Casanova? - Casanova?

1424
00:53:06,903 --> 00:53:07,971
Inside there is Casanova.

1425
00:53:07,971 --> 00:53:08,972
(A crocodile called Casanova?)

1426
00:53:08,972 --> 00:53:10,440
It's called Casanova.

1427
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,509
That one is Casanova. It's funny.

1428
00:53:12,876 --> 00:53:14,110
Casanova!

1429
00:53:14,411 --> 00:53:16,580
My phone number is...

1430
00:53:17,914 --> 00:53:20,650
(Call me, will you?)

1431
00:53:21,685 --> 00:53:23,153
My phone number is...

1432
00:53:23,153 --> 00:53:24,187
(Casanova is So Min's type.)

1433
00:53:24,187 --> 00:53:27,257
Why would you tell him your phone number?

1434
00:53:27,557 --> 00:53:29,359
I was born in 1986.

1435
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:32,229
How old are you?

1436
00:53:34,731 --> 00:53:36,566
- Come on. - Deeper.

1437
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:38,201
- Yummy. - It's like rowing.

1438
00:53:38,201 --> 00:53:39,436
(Yummy)

1439
00:53:39,436 --> 00:53:40,570
It's delicious.

1440
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:44,508
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1441
00:53:44,608 --> 00:53:47,310
- Is this a children's show? - Kids come if you do this.

1442
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,746
(Yummy. Come on.)

1443
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:50,814
Won't they?

1444
00:53:50,814 --> 00:53:52,582
If I was a kid, I'd never come.

1445
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:54,251
I'd never come.

1446
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:58,688
Come on, crocodile.

1447
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:02,292
We're going to give them a big one.

1448
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:03,560
Look at the color.

1449
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:05,495
- It's a lot of meat. - It's a lot.

1450
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:06,663
It's a family set.

1451
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:09,165
- Come. - That one is called Sunshine.

1452
00:54:09,165 --> 00:54:10,233
Come.

1453
00:54:10,233 --> 00:54:11,935
- It's coming. - Dip the meat.

1454
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:13,103
Dip it.

1455
00:54:13,103 --> 00:54:14,971
- Where is it? - Over there.

1456
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:17,340
It's coming. Crocodile.

1457
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:19,242
Come on, Sunshine. Let's go.

1458
00:54:19,242 --> 00:54:20,877
- It's coming. - Sunshine.

1459
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:24,514
- Sunshine. - Sunshine.

1460
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:26,917
- Sunshine, come on. - It's coming.

1461
00:54:26,917 --> 00:54:28,752
(They have to feed her and take a picture.)

1462
00:54:31,555 --> 00:54:32,689
(Look)

1463
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:33,857
(Can we take the picture now?)

1464
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:36,192
- Is it here? - No.

1465
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:40,497
No. The meat dropped.

1466
00:54:40,497 --> 00:54:41,765
(Only the rope is left.)

1467
00:54:41,765 --> 00:54:44,134
(The meat dropped.)

1468
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:46,469
- Give us more meat. - Give us more meat.

1469
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:48,171
Let's use this.

1470
00:54:48,171 --> 00:54:50,874
Move over. I'm coming.

1471
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:53,810
Dropping the meat might not be a bad thing.

1472
00:54:55,312 --> 00:54:56,479
It came off.

1473
00:54:56,479 --> 00:54:57,681
(He keeps moving in vain.)

1474
00:54:57,681 --> 00:54:59,082
Is it here?

1475
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:00,150
It feels like I'm washing the meat.

1476
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:01,685
When will you get to eat something like this?

1477
00:55:01,685 --> 00:55:02,953
- Sunshine. - Sunshine.

1478
00:55:02,953 --> 00:55:05,021
- When will you... - Sunshine.

1479
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:06,289
They must be resting.

1480
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,058
The meat became white.

1481
00:55:08,491 --> 00:55:09,693
We washed it too much.

1482
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:10,961
All the blood got removed.

1483
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:13,563
(Calling for the crocodile)

1484
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:14,998
(Crying like a rooster)

1485
00:55:14,998 --> 00:55:16,333
What kind of sound is that?

1486
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,835
They might run away.

1487
00:55:18,835 --> 00:55:19,903
Are they coming?

1488
00:55:20,503 --> 00:55:21,938
So this was our penalty.

1489
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:23,974
(The sound of labor)

1490
00:55:23,974 --> 00:55:25,175
This was the penalty.

1491
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,377
The sun is about to set.

1492
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:28,478
It's about to set.

1493
00:55:28,478 --> 00:55:30,113
I'm the one who lost.

1494
00:55:30,547 --> 00:55:33,316
Use this. Let it go.

1495
00:55:33,316 --> 00:55:34,351
(They try to lure another crocodile.)

1496
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:35,585
Don't put out your hand.

1497
00:55:35,952 --> 00:55:37,153
- My hand? - There's one over here.

1498
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:38,588
- Here's one. - Is it coming?

1499
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:39,623
(They badly want to succeed.)

1500
00:55:39,623 --> 00:55:41,124
- Stay still. - It's coming.

1501
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:44,361
- It's coming. Please. - It's yummy.

1502
00:55:44,361 --> 00:55:45,495
- Jae Seok isn't in the frame. - Prepare the camera.

1503
00:55:45,495 --> 00:55:46,763
- Prepare the camera. - Jae Seok.

1504
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:48,231
- It's coming. - Kwang Soo.

1505
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:49,933
- Kwang Soo. - Come this way, Jae Seok.

1506
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:51,701
- I'm so scared. - I'll do it.

1507
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:53,103
Wait, I'll do it.

1508
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:55,171
Excuse me. Can you take our picture?

1509
00:55:56,072 --> 00:55:57,173
Please?

1510
00:55:57,707 --> 00:55:59,242
- Come in the frame. - Here it is.

1511
00:55:59,242 --> 00:56:00,944
- It's yummy. - He's not in the frame.

1512
00:56:01,244 --> 00:56:03,380
- It's yummy. - Goodness.

1513
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,382
(Even when a crocodile approaches,)

1514
00:56:05,382 --> 00:56:07,484
- Take a photo now. - Do it.

1515
00:56:07,484 --> 00:56:08,518
(they can't take a photo.)

1516
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:09,919
It's yummy.

1517
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:11,287
- Take a photo now. - Take it.

1518
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:12,355
Take a photo.

1519
00:56:12,689 --> 00:56:14,290
- Hurry and take a photo. - No.

1520
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,525
Take a photo now.

1521
00:56:15,625 --> 00:56:17,360
- Goodness. - The crocodile left.

1522
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,062
Move one of the rods away.

1523
00:56:19,062 --> 00:56:20,397
Where did it go?

1524
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:22,065
There's a bigger one. Do you see it?

1525
00:56:22,065 --> 00:56:23,900
- What's that? - It's a bigger crocodile.

1526
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,901
(Did a bigger crocodile appear?)

1527
00:56:24,901 --> 00:56:26,102
- It's bigger. - Be careful.

1528
00:56:26,903 --> 00:56:28,338
- What's going on? - Goodness.

1529
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:30,273
They found out that we have food.

1530
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:33,476
Come this way.

1531
00:56:33,476 --> 00:56:34,878
- Get ready. - Wait.

1532
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:36,312
- Do it slowly. - Come in the frame.

1533
00:56:36,312 --> 00:56:37,881
Do it slowly.

1534
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:39,082
You have to be in the frame, Jae Seok.

1535
00:56:39,082 --> 00:56:41,451
- I'm too scared to do it. - Come on.

1536
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:44,688
(They're startled by the crocodile's gesture.)

1537
00:56:44,688 --> 00:56:46,389
(The red teeth look gruesome.)

1538
00:56:47,057 --> 00:56:48,391
My goodness.

1539
00:56:48,391 --> 00:56:49,592
- Gosh. - The meat fell off.

1540
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:51,361
- Goodness. - You got it.

1541
00:56:51,361 --> 00:56:53,063
- Get in the frame. - Oh, no.

1542
00:56:53,063 --> 00:56:54,464
- Gosh. - The meat fell off.

1543
00:56:55,398 --> 00:56:57,434
You have to be in the photo.

1544
00:56:57,434 --> 00:56:59,002
- Seok Jin. - Let's take a photo.

1545
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,336
(Let's take a photo.)

1546
00:57:00,336 --> 00:57:01,438
- It's here. - Seok Jin.

1547
00:57:01,604 --> 00:57:03,273
Come in the frame.

1548
00:57:03,373 --> 00:57:04,741
- Come in the frame. - Kwang Soo.

1549
00:57:04,741 --> 00:57:07,310
The crocodile is ready to jump.

1550
00:57:07,444 --> 00:57:08,712
Turn around, Jae Seok.

1551
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:10,547
I have to keep watching.

1552
00:57:11,314 --> 00:57:13,483
(Either he took a selfie alone,)

1553
00:57:13,483 --> 00:57:15,685
(or he took one without any crocodile.)

1554
00:57:15,685 --> 00:57:16,853
Kwang Soo.

1555
00:57:16,853 --> 00:57:18,521
Did you see the red teeth?

1556
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:23,893
- Pardon me. - We're doomed.

1557
00:57:23,893 --> 00:57:26,062
- We're doomed. Take it out. - Wait.

1558
00:57:26,262 --> 00:57:28,098
- What's going on? - Take it out.

1559
00:57:28,264 --> 00:57:30,066
- Wait. - Did I get it on camera?

1560
00:57:30,066 --> 00:57:31,134
- Let's calm down. - Relax.

1561
00:57:32,001 --> 00:57:33,002
(He holds the stick with a camera.)

1562
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:34,337
It's hiding.

1563
00:57:34,471 --> 00:57:36,272
It went back in the water.

1564
00:57:37,807 --> 00:57:40,944
(The camera gets stuck in the tree.)

1565
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:43,313
We're doomed. We have to take it out.

1566
00:57:43,313 --> 00:57:44,447
Goodness.

1567
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:49,252
(What they filmed today got lost.)

1568
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:52,722
(What should we do now?)

1569
00:57:52,722 --> 00:57:55,625
I'm sorry. It got stuck in the tree.

1570
00:57:56,192 --> 00:57:57,227
Was it filmed?

1571
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:58,461
(Everyone looks at the water.)

1572
00:57:59,162 --> 00:58:00,497
- Is that it? - Yes.

1573
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:01,898
We can take it out.

1574
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:04,000
Thankfully, it's standing up.

1575
00:58:04,267 --> 00:58:05,268
(Jae Seok is quite flustered.)

1576
00:58:05,268 --> 00:58:06,770
Did we lose everything?

1577
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:08,171
All we have to do is take it out.

1578
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:10,173
Can you take it out?

1579
00:58:10,874 --> 00:58:13,610
(It's a moment of risk.)

1580
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:17,247
(An assistant boat comes to rescue.)

1581
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:19,315
- Okay, grab it. - Goodness.

1582
00:58:19,315 --> 00:58:20,383
(Please save our camera.)

1583
00:58:20,383 --> 00:58:21,417
It's over here.

1584
00:58:21,684 --> 00:58:26,422
(All staff members hope that the camera will be saved.)

1585
00:58:26,422 --> 00:58:27,423
Okay.

1586
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:29,692
(He successfully takes out the camera.)

1587
00:58:29,692 --> 00:58:31,027
He got it.

1588
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:33,997
(Jae Seok is relieved about the camera.)

1589
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:35,999
It's still stuck in the tree.

1590
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,001
Thank goodness.

1591
00:58:38,001 --> 00:58:40,470
- There we go. - What a relief.

1592
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:43,039
I'm so relieved.

1593
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:47,110
I'd be exasperated if we lost what we shot.

1594
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:49,145
- You'd feel bad. - Did you see...

1595
00:58:49,145 --> 00:58:51,948
Chul Min yell at me in anger?

1596
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:56,319
(We're doomed.)

1597
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:58,454
(We have to take it out.)

1598
00:58:58,454 --> 00:59:00,256
(We have to take out the camera!)

1599
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:02,992
I'm sorry. We almost lost what we shot.

1600
00:59:02,992 --> 00:59:05,061
When Chul Min said that we were in trouble,

1601
00:59:05,161 --> 00:59:07,730
he said it while looking at you.

1602
00:59:07,764 --> 00:59:09,165
- I'm sorry, Chul Min. - He did that.

1603
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:10,834
While holding the camera,

1604
00:59:10,834 --> 00:59:12,802
I didn't want to damage the tree.

1605
00:59:12,802 --> 00:59:14,404
So many things happened.

1606
00:59:14,404 --> 00:59:16,439
Things can get wild in nature.

1607
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:18,808
Thank you, thank you very much.

1608
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:21,110
- Yes. - You're welcome.

1609
00:59:21,377 --> 00:59:22,745
We should have succeeded.

1610
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:24,681
All we needed was a photo.

1611
00:59:24,681 --> 00:59:26,015
We had a chance,

1612
00:59:26,015 --> 00:59:27,750
but Jae Seok dropped the camera.

1613
00:59:28,518 --> 00:59:30,253
(Jae Seok is the troublemaker.)

1614
00:59:30,253 --> 00:59:32,121
Why do you cause trouble?

1615
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:34,791
- He's such a troublemaker. - Seriously.

1616
00:59:35,225 --> 00:59:37,594
- Jae Seok. - He's a troublemaker.

1617
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:38,995
Gosh, Jae Seok.

1618
00:59:38,995 --> 00:59:40,063
I'm sorry, So Min.

1619
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:41,831
- You're as bad as me. - I'm sorry.

1620
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:43,633
It's the last one.

1621
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:45,602
- Isn't it the last one? - It's fine.

1622
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:48,104
- They might come. - We used most of the bait.

1623
00:59:48,104 --> 00:59:49,105
Isn't it fun?

1624
00:59:49,105 --> 00:59:50,373
(Kwang Soo puts on bait.)

1625
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:52,208
(What happened?)

1626
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:54,477
- In reality... - Did it fall?

1627
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:56,412
- Did it fall? - The meat fell in.

1628
00:59:56,412 --> 00:59:58,681
There are troublemakers everywhere.

1629
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:00,350
He was the one who dropped it,

1630
01:00:00,483 --> 01:00:02,719
but I can't say anything in English.

1631
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,921
Gosh.

1632
01:00:05,455 --> 01:00:07,757
- He's a troublemaker. - You're a troublemaker.

1633
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:10,693
(He shows his anger with facial expressions.)

1634
01:00:10,693 --> 01:00:12,262
- Okay. - Go get it.

1635
01:00:12,262 --> 01:00:13,696
- Okay. - Okay.

1636
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:18,001
Be careful.

1637
01:00:18,401 --> 01:00:20,336
The meat turned white.

1638
01:00:20,336 --> 01:00:21,804
(They keep fishing.)

1639
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:23,039
Are there three?

1640
01:00:25,942 --> 01:00:27,176
Are there three?

1641
01:00:28,244 --> 01:00:30,713
(A crocodile pops up.)

1642
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,883
- Bring the camera. - Hold it up.

1643
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:36,452
- Hold the camera higher. - Hold it up.

1644
01:00:36,452 --> 01:00:38,788
(They're determined to go home.)

1645
01:00:38,788 --> 01:00:39,856
Higher.

1646
01:00:39,856 --> 01:00:41,391
- Get the camera. - Do it.

1647
01:00:41,391 --> 01:00:43,059
- Let's do it. - It's as if...

1648
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:44,127
It's coming.

1649
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:45,561
- It's as if the fish is jumping. - It's coming.

1650
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:46,629
(They're feeling lucky.)

1651
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:48,498
It's coming. Come on.

1652
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:50,066
(What happened?)

1653
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,734
What have you done?

1654
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,002
- It's as if the fish is jumping. - It's coming.

1655
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:56,205
(He lets the crocodile take the bait.)

1656
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:57,607
- Goodness. - I'm sorry.

1657
01:00:57,607 --> 01:00:59,442
- You're such a troublemaker. - Stop it.

1658
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:00,543
I'll do it better.

1659
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,245
- It's here. - Goodness, Jae Seok.

1660
01:01:02,245 --> 01:01:03,746
It's eating the meat.

1661
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:05,915
- Take a photo now. - Take it.

1662
01:01:05,915 --> 01:01:07,183
Take a photo.

1663
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:09,252
- Take it. - Get in the shot.

1664
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:11,521
Get in the shot.

1665
01:01:11,854 --> 01:01:12,922
Get in the shot.

1666
01:01:12,956 --> 01:01:15,658
We got a photo.

1667
01:01:15,892 --> 01:01:17,360
You're such a troublemaker.

1668
01:01:17,493 --> 01:01:18,928
What's wrong with you today?

1669
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:21,064
He won't come because he's full.

1670
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,333
- He ate and left. - No way.

1671
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:25,969
We finally had a chance after three hours.

1672
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:29,672
- Goodness. - I'm sorry.

1673
01:01:29,672 --> 01:01:31,507
- You're such a troublemaker. - Stop it.

1674
01:01:31,507 --> 01:01:32,608
I'll do it better.

1675
01:01:32,608 --> 01:01:34,310
- It's here. - Goodness, Jae Seok.

1676
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:35,812
It's eating the meat.

1677
01:01:35,812 --> 01:01:37,981
- Take a photo now. - Take it.

1678
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:39,248
Take a photo.

1679
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:41,317
- Take it. - Get in the shot.

1680
01:01:41,417 --> 01:01:43,586
Get in the shot.

1681
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,988
Get in the shot.

1682
01:01:45,021 --> 01:01:47,724
We got a photo.

1683
01:01:47,957 --> 01:01:49,425
You're such a troublemaker.

1684
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:50,994
What's wrong with you today?

1685
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,129
He won't come because he's full.

1686
01:01:53,296 --> 01:01:55,398
- He ate and left. - No way.

1687
01:01:55,398 --> 01:01:58,034
We finally had a chance after three hours.

1688
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,936
The crocodile is in the photo.

1689
01:01:59,936 --> 01:02:01,070
- Is it? - Yes.

1690
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:02,505
It looks clear.

1691
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:04,040
(They take a photo with the crocodile.)

1692
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,441
The crocodile looks clear.

1693
01:02:05,441 --> 01:02:07,610
- We got the photo. - This is amazing.

1694
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,278
- It has meat in the mouth. - Approved.

1695
01:02:09,379 --> 01:02:11,714
(They successfully take a photo with a crocodile.)

1696
01:02:11,714 --> 01:02:12,715
Okay.

1697
01:02:12,715 --> 01:02:13,783
Goodness.

1698
01:02:14,484 --> 01:02:15,518
Why did you drop it?

1699
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:18,087
All three of you are cursing at me at once.

1700
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:20,023
You're such a terrible troublemaker.

1701
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:21,791
- Seriously. - Goodness.

1702
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,560
My throat became sore from screaming so much.

1703
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,628
Gosh.

1704
01:02:25,928 --> 01:02:28,331
You have one last Chance Card.

1705
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:29,732
- Aren't we done? - I hope it's a good one.

1706
01:02:29,732 --> 01:02:31,768
- What do you want to do? - Let's not take it.

1707
01:02:31,768 --> 01:02:33,770
You may check what it is after rejecting it.

1708
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:34,837
- We reject it. - How about...

1709
01:02:34,837 --> 01:02:36,039
What do you think, So Min?

1710
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:37,106
I want to reject it.

1711
01:02:37,106 --> 01:02:38,441
- How about you? - I want to take it.

1712
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:41,544
- How about you? - I prefer to rest after this.

1713
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:43,312
It's 2 to 1.

1714
01:02:43,646 --> 01:02:45,214
- How about you? - I want to reject it.

1715
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:47,350
- It's 3 to 1. - I'll reject it.

1716
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,852
- We'll reject it. - You decided to reject it.

1717
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:51,287
- Yes. - Take a look.

1718
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:52,588
(They reject the Chance Card.)

1719
01:02:52,588 --> 01:02:54,290
There has to be something good.

1720
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:57,026
(What was written on the Chance Card?)

1721
01:02:57,026 --> 01:02:58,027
What is it?

1722
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:59,395
"You may go to..."

1723
01:02:59,729 --> 01:03:00,797
I'll take it.

1724
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:02,398
Take a look first.

1725
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:09,038
(You may go to a restaurant of your choice.)

1726
01:03:09,038 --> 01:03:10,173
A restaurant?

1727
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:12,708
This isn't right.

1728
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,776
Goodness.

1729
01:03:14,811 --> 01:03:17,046
(He punches everyone.)

1730
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:19,849
(I said that we should take it.)

1731
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:20,917
(He can't control his anger.)

1732
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,652
I'll buy it for you.

1733
01:03:22,652 --> 01:03:23,653
Let's go.

1734
01:03:23,653 --> 01:03:24,854
(Their mission is over.)

1735
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:25,922
I'll treat you.

1736
01:03:27,757 --> 01:03:30,560
(Team New Zealand stands in front of the swing.)

1737
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:32,728
- Let's take a look. - I can't do it.

1738
01:03:32,728 --> 01:03:34,230
Let's check it out.

1739
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,364
What's that bridge for?

1740
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,334
We have to cross the bridge to get there.

1741
01:03:38,568 --> 01:03:39,635
Is that it?

1742
01:03:39,836 --> 01:03:42,105
That's why it's like the Golden Gate Bridge.

1743
01:03:42,638 --> 01:03:43,940
This is...

1744
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,976
(It's a bridge over a cliff.)

1745
01:03:46,976 --> 01:03:48,377
(A bridge over a cliff)

1746
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:52,148
(It's the only route to the Nevis Swing.)

1747
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:56,786
(If you want the swing, you must cross the bridge.)

1748
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,588
My gosh. Look below.

1749
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:00,623
I can't even cross that.

1750
01:04:00,656 --> 01:04:02,625
There's bungee jumping next to it.

1751
01:04:02,792 --> 01:04:03,860
Oh, dear.

1752
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:05,194
There's bungee jumping.

1753
01:04:06,329 --> 01:04:11,968
(Haha and Se Chan start gagging again.)

1754
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:17,507
(Jong Kook is taking a selfie.)

1755
01:04:17,507 --> 01:04:18,975
How are we supposed to cross this?

1756
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:23,179
(Looking at it makes him sigh.)

1757
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:24,480
Nevis.

1758
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:25,581
(Looking at it makes him sigh.)

1759
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:27,150
Do we go this way?

1760
01:04:32,088 --> 01:04:33,923
(He pops in.)

1761
01:04:33,923 --> 01:04:35,691
No, there are holes.

1762
01:04:35,691 --> 01:04:36,959
(Are you guys scared? I'm excited.)

1763
01:04:36,959 --> 01:04:37,960
(I'm excited too.)

1764
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,262
It's moving.

1765
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:41,564
(Once you cross the scary bridge,)

1766
01:04:41,564 --> 01:04:46,202
(it's the Nevis Swing.)

1767
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:52,675
(Before they start, they must be trained for safety.)

1768
01:04:52,675 --> 01:04:54,210
- What's this? - Fill out this one.

1769
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:55,311
You have to fill it out.

1770
01:04:55,311 --> 01:04:57,446
- Is this a memorandum of some sort? - You have to fill it out.

1771
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:00,183
First name.

1772
01:05:00,216 --> 01:05:01,918
It's Dong Hoon. My surname is Ha.

1773
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:03,419
It's Ha Dong Hoon?

1774
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,722
- Okay. - Please, please. Help me.

1775
01:05:07,757 --> 01:05:09,825
- Killing me softly. - He just threw up.

1776
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,296
(They're registered.)

1777
01:05:13,296 --> 01:05:14,764
You four?

1778
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:17,466
- These two are going. - Are you guys going together?

1779
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,735
- Together, yes. My crew. - You're going to be fine.

1780
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:22,905
My hero.

1781
01:05:23,706 --> 01:05:25,007
All right. So what's your name?

1782
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:27,610
Your name.

1783
01:05:28,077 --> 01:05:30,313
(He's silent.)

1784
01:05:30,313 --> 01:05:31,547
Haha.

1785
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:32,815
- This one? - Yes.

1786
01:05:32,815 --> 01:05:34,217
(He's funny.)

1787
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,586
- Take your hat off. - Your hat.

1788
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:38,254
Make sure there's nothing in your pockets.

1789
01:05:38,354 --> 01:05:39,422
He's going to weigh you.

1790
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:41,624
(Once you're registered, they weigh you.)

1791
01:05:41,657 --> 01:05:42,825
They're going to weigh me?

1792
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:46,295
(My weight?)

1793
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,565
Take your hat off.

1794
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,168
Are you going to film this?

1795
01:05:52,168 --> 01:05:54,270
(She's hesitant.)

1796
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:57,306
With clothes on, you're much heavier than expected.

1797
01:05:57,306 --> 01:05:58,674
Don't worry. You have clothes on.

1798
01:05:58,674 --> 01:06:00,443
Your clothes must be very heavy.

1799
01:06:01,377 --> 01:06:03,379
- Step on. - My gosh.

1800
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:04,547
Are you going to film this?

1801
01:06:04,647 --> 01:06:06,749
Step on. Stay still.

1802
01:06:06,749 --> 01:06:10,152
(She steps on the scale.)

1803
01:06:10,586 --> 01:06:12,188
Oh, my goodness.

1804
01:06:13,089 --> 01:06:14,123
Oh, my goodness.

1805
01:06:15,858 --> 01:06:17,226
He's not allowed to say that.

1806
01:06:17,226 --> 01:06:19,128
- He's not allowed to say. - I think it's a secret.

1807
01:06:19,128 --> 01:06:20,963
I have my clothes on.

1808
01:06:23,266 --> 01:06:24,433
Okay.

1809
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,737
(They get safety training and put equipment on.)

1810
01:06:30,006 --> 01:06:32,108
How do you say, "Please make it tight"?

1811
01:06:32,208 --> 01:06:33,643
Can you make it tighter?

1812
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:39,382
(He tries his best to tighten the safety belt.)

1813
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:40,816
If it's a little bit loose, that's okay.

1814
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:43,419
There's a chance game, right? Why am I nervous?

1815
01:06:43,419 --> 01:06:44,520
These guys here,

1816
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,956
they have to sit down but upside down.

1817
01:06:46,956 --> 01:06:47,957
Okay.

1818
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:49,191
You guys are doing upside down?

1819
01:06:49,825 --> 01:06:51,127
You guys are doing upside down, yes?

1820
01:06:51,127 --> 01:06:52,528
- What? - Upside down?

1821
01:06:52,862 --> 01:06:54,297
- Do you want to go upside down? - Upside down?

1822
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:56,966
No way.

1823
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:58,334
I want to stay upright.

1824
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:59,902
He says no.

1825
01:07:00,403 --> 01:07:01,804
- I want to stay upright. - It's not upside down.

1826
01:07:03,406 --> 01:07:05,708
(He almost said yes.)

1827
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:06,876
- Strong? - Yes.

1828
01:07:06,876 --> 01:07:09,979
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are relaxed.)

1829
01:07:09,979 --> 01:07:13,215
(He's laughing, and she's dancing.)

1830
01:07:13,349 --> 01:07:14,684
Okay, guys. Are you ready?

1831
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,052
- Yes. - Ready.

1832
01:07:16,352 --> 01:07:17,853
Time to go.

1833
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,221
- Go? - Yes.

1834
01:07:19,355 --> 01:07:21,023
Challenge yourselves.

1835
01:07:21,057 --> 01:07:22,792
- Okay. - Challenge yourselves.

1836
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:23,859
- Okay. - Yes.

1837
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:25,294
(He roots for them in Korean.)

1838
01:07:25,294 --> 01:07:26,395
Don't worry. No problem.

1839
01:07:27,096 --> 01:07:28,264
(I hope you don't change your mind.)

1840
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:33,669
(The safety training is done. They are off to the Nevis Swing.)

1841
01:07:33,669 --> 01:07:35,705
Let's get it.

1842
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:37,273
Let's get it.

1843
01:07:37,273 --> 01:07:38,374
You can do it.

1844
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:41,077
I don't think I can do it. I think I have to give up.

1845
01:07:41,077 --> 01:07:42,378
(They can't even look at it.)

1846
01:07:42,678 --> 01:07:43,946
My goodness. Hold on.

1847
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:46,048
(He's shocked.)

1848
01:07:46,415 --> 01:07:47,516
Look at that.

1849
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:49,885
(Jong Kook steps on.)

1850
01:07:50,886 --> 01:07:52,254
- My gosh. - I can't go.

1851
01:07:52,254 --> 01:07:53,789
(Wait for us, Jong Kook.)

1852
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:55,157
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1853
01:07:55,157 --> 01:07:56,359
You can't go.

1854
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:58,527
Haha can't cross.

1855
01:07:59,228 --> 01:08:00,796
- Hurry. - Look forward.

1856
01:08:03,065 --> 01:08:05,267
(On top of a tall cliff...)

1857
01:08:05,267 --> 01:08:06,902
It's so long.

1858
01:08:06,902 --> 01:08:08,504
(On top of a tall cliff, the bridge hangs.)

1859
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:10,106
This is driving me crazy.

1860
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:11,774
I can't do this, Ji Hyo. What should I do?

1861
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:13,676
What do I do?

1862
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:15,344
Don't look down.

1863
01:08:15,611 --> 01:08:17,813
He's incredible.

1864
01:08:18,948 --> 01:08:20,149
He's insane.

1865
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:23,018
(They watch Jong Kook go...)

1866
01:08:23,018 --> 01:08:27,857
(and gather up the courage to start.)

1867
01:08:29,358 --> 01:08:30,626
Here we go.

1868
01:08:31,527 --> 01:08:32,795
Byul.

1869
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,098
What do I do?

1870
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:37,299
This is driving me crazy.

1871
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,834
Look forward. Look far.

1872
01:08:38,834 --> 01:08:40,736
(They're cautious.)

1873
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:47,943
Don't look down.

1874
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:49,278
I'm serious.

1875
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,481
My gosh.

1876
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:53,983
Bring your legs to the sides.

1877
01:08:53,983 --> 01:08:56,118
- There's a gap in the middle. - This is unbelievable.

1878
01:08:56,118 --> 01:08:57,586
(Jong Kook is filming everything.)

1879
01:08:58,921 --> 01:09:00,623
(They only look straight ahead.)

1880
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,893
- This is insane. - It's shaking.

1881
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:07,596
Bring your legs to the sides.

1882
01:09:07,596 --> 01:09:08,864
There's a gap in the middle.

1883
01:09:09,331 --> 01:09:13,769
(When does this bridge end?)

1884
01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:15,671
Why are we even here?

1885
01:09:15,671 --> 01:09:17,773
Don't shake it, Jong Kook.

1886
01:09:17,773 --> 01:09:19,108
Don't shake it.

1887
01:09:20,476 --> 01:09:21,644
Oh, my goodness.

1888
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:23,379
Oh, my goodness.

1889
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:27,783
(Jong Kook arrives first and looks down.)

1890
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:33,355
My gosh. This...

1891
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:35,791
(They're almost here.)

1892
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:37,460
My foot is about to go numb.

1893
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:38,861
I'm focusing too much strength in my toes.

1894
01:09:38,861 --> 01:09:40,863
This is like a scene from "Silmido".

1895
01:09:42,331 --> 01:09:43,833
I looked down.

1896
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:47,436
(They finally reach the end.)

1897
01:09:47,436 --> 01:09:49,538
(Isn't that enough for a penalty?)

1898
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,006
Mission complete.

1899
01:09:51,707 --> 01:09:53,342
Mission complete.

1900
01:09:53,442 --> 01:09:58,948
(My legs are giving out already.)

1901
01:10:01,016 --> 01:10:02,117
It's high.

1902
01:10:02,117 --> 01:10:06,355
(It's time to use the exemption card.)

1903
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:07,756
You startled me.

1904
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:10,359
(Burping)

1905
01:10:11,727 --> 01:10:14,063
Burping is a type of breathing.

1906
01:10:14,063 --> 01:10:15,798
It's a type of breathing. Good job.

1907
01:10:15,798 --> 01:10:17,132
Good job, Haha.

1908
01:10:17,132 --> 01:10:18,901
What did I do wrong?

1909
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:20,870
I'm sorry if I did anything wrong.

1910
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:23,239
This is really scary.

1911
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:26,041
Everybody, since you successfully completed the swing dance...

1912
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:27,209
(They got a chance card from completing a mission.)

1913
01:10:27,209 --> 01:10:28,544
- You have a chance card. - Right.

1914
01:10:28,544 --> 01:10:30,145
(They got a chance card from completing a mission.)

1915
01:10:31,247 --> 01:10:34,316
(They completed the swing dance, so they got an exemption chance.)

1916
01:10:34,316 --> 01:10:36,652
(One person won't be penalized.)

1917
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:38,053
Who will be exempted?

1918
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:40,523
If you pick the exemption card,

1919
01:10:40,789 --> 01:10:43,359
you can use it, give it up,

1920
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:45,194
or not use it.

1921
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:46,562
Okay.

1922
01:10:46,929 --> 01:10:47,997
- This is unbelievable. - Haha...

1923
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,533
is crying right now.

1924
01:10:50,566 --> 01:10:52,134
- He's really crying. - This is unbelievable.

1925
01:10:52,301 --> 01:10:56,739
(I cry sometimes in front of the swing.)

1926
01:10:56,739 --> 01:10:58,173
This is unbelievable.

1927
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:00,009
Please pick. One at a time.

1928
01:11:00,009 --> 01:11:03,746
(Out of 4 cards, only 1 is an exemption card.)

1929
01:11:04,947 --> 01:11:08,551
(Who is going to be that one person?)

1930
01:11:08,551 --> 01:11:09,652
I'll take this.

1931
01:11:09,685 --> 01:11:12,288
Please take it.

1932
01:11:12,288 --> 01:11:14,456
Please show me in three.

1933
01:11:14,456 --> 01:11:15,524
Do you want this?

1934
01:11:16,358 --> 01:11:17,459
Who wants to switch?

1935
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:19,895
(He's easily influenced.)

1936
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:21,263
No, it's okay.

1937
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:23,999
Look at his face.

1938
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,434
Ready.

1939
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:26,936
One,

1940
01:11:28,837 --> 01:11:30,005
two...

1941
01:11:30,005 --> 01:11:31,707
(Who will be exempted?)

1942
01:11:31,707 --> 01:11:32,875
Three.

1943
01:11:36,645 --> 01:11:39,682
(Jong Kook is exempted.)

1944
01:11:39,682 --> 01:11:42,952
(He's the least scared of them all.)

1945
01:11:42,952 --> 01:11:44,887
I'll live as your slave all my life.

1946
01:11:46,855 --> 01:11:48,857
(Collapsing)

1947
01:11:48,857 --> 01:11:51,160
For the rest of my life,

1948
01:11:51,594 --> 01:11:54,396
I'll live as your dog.

1949
01:11:56,432 --> 01:11:58,567
Don't do this.

1950
01:11:58,567 --> 01:11:59,868
Please, Jong Kook.

1951
01:11:59,868 --> 01:12:01,236
After we got here,

1952
01:12:01,236 --> 01:12:02,371
I don't think I can do it.

1953
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:04,473
I can't do it after seeing that.

1954
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,542
This is brutal.

1955
01:12:06,542 --> 01:12:08,277
Since he picked the exemption card...

1956
01:12:08,277 --> 01:12:09,578
Please, Jong Kook.

1957
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:10,646
I'm serious.

1958
01:12:10,846 --> 01:12:12,081
Look at me, Jong Kook.

1959
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:14,249
- It's me, Jong Kook. - What?

1960
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:15,985
It's me.

1961
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:17,686
It's me, Ha Dong Hoon.

1962
01:12:18,487 --> 01:12:21,123
- All right. - Give it to him.

1963
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:22,791
Since "X-Man", right?

1964
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:26,395
When you conquered...

1965
01:12:27,129 --> 01:12:28,998
all three music awards,

1966
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:30,532
who was next to you?

1967
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:32,568
I was there.

1968
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,136
(It was me, Ha Dong Hoon.)

1969
01:12:35,738 --> 01:12:37,606
(Do you remember the days?)

1970
01:12:37,606 --> 01:12:39,808
(We used to sweep "X-Man" as a team.)

1971
01:12:39,808 --> 01:12:42,044
(It's been 13 years,)

1972
01:12:42,044 --> 01:12:44,113
(and we are still a team.)

1973
01:12:45,381 --> 01:12:47,049
This is heartbreaking.

1974
01:12:47,049 --> 01:12:52,388
Please become Dream and So Wool's godfather.

1975
01:12:54,623 --> 01:12:55,891
This is heartbreaking.

1976
01:12:55,891 --> 01:12:57,526
This looks really scary.

1977
01:12:57,526 --> 01:12:58,827
- You should try that. - Haha,

1978
01:12:58,827 --> 01:13:00,396
hold this.

1979
01:13:00,696 --> 01:13:02,698
(Grabbing)

1980
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:04,933
Haha.

1981
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:06,135
Thank you.

1982
01:13:06,135 --> 01:13:07,636
I'm sorry, Se Chan.

1983
01:13:07,636 --> 01:13:08,871
(Were you scared, Haha?)

1984
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:10,172
Thank you very much.

1985
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:11,974
What is your decision, Jong Kook?

1986
01:13:11,974 --> 01:13:13,042
One,

1987
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:15,911
- two, - Thank you.

1988
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:17,346
three.

1989
01:13:18,147 --> 01:13:21,984
(Ripping)

1990
01:13:23,018 --> 01:13:25,621
(He hesitates...)

1991
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:29,658
(and rips the exemption card.)

1992
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:30,826
What was that?

1993
01:13:30,826 --> 01:13:33,028
(This is not a paused screen.)

1994
01:13:33,028 --> 01:13:34,196
What was that, Jong Kook?

1995
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,564
Let's do it together.

1996
01:13:36,498 --> 01:13:38,200
We came this far.

1997
01:13:39,001 --> 01:13:41,303
(Let's go on it together.)

1998
01:13:41,303 --> 01:13:43,939
(Punching)

1999
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:45,274
- Do you think this is funny? - Wait.

2000
01:13:45,874 --> 01:13:47,443
Do you find this funny?

2001
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,844
- Do you think this is funny? - Wait.

2002
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:50,612
He's really mad.

2003
01:13:50,646 --> 01:13:53,482
(Give it back.)

2004
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:56,085
No.

2005
01:13:56,418 --> 01:13:57,486
No!

2006
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:00,622
This can't be happening.

2007
01:14:00,622 --> 01:14:01,623
(It's a puzzle.)

2008
01:14:01,623 --> 01:14:03,726
I'm sorry. I'm not pretending.

2009
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:04,893
This is for real. I'm serious.

2010
01:14:06,595 --> 01:14:07,696
Sir,

2011
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:09,331
please take this.

2012
01:14:09,331 --> 01:14:10,365
(I put it together. Isn't this good enough?)

2013
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:12,067
- Haha. - I'll do anything.

2014
01:14:12,067 --> 01:14:14,036
This doesn't say the right word.

2015
01:14:14,036 --> 01:14:15,404
This won't work.

2016
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:18,540
(It's missing a piece.)

2017
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:20,209
- This won't work. - Please.

2018
01:14:20,409 --> 01:14:23,846
Please help me.

2019
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:25,781
- Haha. - What do I do?

2020
01:14:26,014 --> 01:14:27,816
It's not the right word, so it doesn't count.

2021
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:29,685
(Punching)

2022
01:14:29,685 --> 01:14:32,321
(You're just like Jong Kook.)

2023
01:14:32,554 --> 01:14:35,357
(They all get to go on Nevis Swing.)

2024
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:37,993
Let's go.

2025
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:39,461
Let's get it. Come on.

2026
01:14:39,528 --> 01:14:40,963
This feels like a dream.

2027
01:14:40,963 --> 01:14:42,698
I'm going on this? Me?

2028
01:14:42,898 --> 01:14:44,500
Me? I'm going on this?

2029
01:14:45,167 --> 01:14:46,201
(He's going mad.)

2030
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:48,937
Me? I'm going on this?

2031
01:14:49,671 --> 01:14:53,375
You need to breathe.

2032
01:14:53,375 --> 01:14:54,376
Breathe.

2033
01:14:54,376 --> 01:14:55,477
(He's enraged.)

2034
01:14:56,044 --> 01:14:57,646
I need to imagine.

2035
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:00,382
Dream, you are down there.

2036
01:15:00,449 --> 01:15:01,650
So Wool is down there as well.

2037
01:15:02,184 --> 01:15:04,987
There's a war, so I have to save you.

2038
01:15:05,554 --> 01:15:07,556
Aliens have invaded.

2039
01:15:07,556 --> 01:15:08,857
I'm coming to save you.

2040
01:15:08,857 --> 01:15:10,159
(He hypnotizes himself.)

2041
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,094
Daddy is coming to save you.

2042
01:15:12,427 --> 01:15:14,596
This looks so scary.

2043
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:16,932
Okay, let's do this.

2044
01:15:16,932 --> 01:15:18,367
Let's go.

2045
01:15:18,367 --> 01:15:20,702
(Will the two cowards be fine?)

2046
01:15:23,906 --> 01:15:27,142
(The reality is in front of him.)

2047
01:15:27,843 --> 01:15:29,378
We're going to walk straight.

2048
01:15:29,378 --> 01:15:30,879
- What? How? - Yes?

2049
01:15:30,879 --> 01:15:32,614
- What did she say? - Come on.

2050
01:15:33,048 --> 01:15:35,250
- Come on. - You're going to be strong.

2051
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:37,085
No, I'm going to die.

2052
01:15:37,186 --> 01:15:38,387
He said he's dying.

2053
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:39,488
(They lost all motivation in front of the cliff.)

2054
01:15:39,488 --> 01:15:40,556
From now on?

2055
01:15:40,556 --> 01:15:42,090
- You go first. - No.

2056
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:43,292
We'll go together.

2057
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:45,394
Come on.

2058
01:15:45,527 --> 01:15:47,329
- How? We're going to die. - What do I do?

2059
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:48,697
You can move it back.

2060
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,501
You got to stand all the way up.

2061
01:15:54,002 --> 01:15:55,204
(She's too kind.)

2062
01:15:57,239 --> 01:15:58,340
It's fine, okay?

2063
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,408
(Why are you doing this to me?)

2064
01:15:59,408 --> 01:16:01,076
Can you tell her to hold me?

2065
01:16:01,076 --> 01:16:02,077
All right.

2066
01:16:02,077 --> 01:16:05,080
I need you to come up here so that I can keep you nice and safe.

2067
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,081
(It's difficult just to get on the swing.)

2068
01:16:06,081 --> 01:16:07,783
- Okay. - Lie down.

2069
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:10,986
Hands down.

2070
01:16:12,321 --> 01:16:14,122
(They put safety equipment on at the end of the cliff.)

2071
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:15,858
Hold on. Is this okay?

2072
01:16:15,858 --> 01:16:17,025
I think it's tangled.

2073
01:16:17,025 --> 01:16:18,360
Be careful.

2074
01:16:19,661 --> 01:16:21,196
Dream. So Wool.

2075
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,698
Please make it tight.

2076
01:16:23,265 --> 01:16:25,534
- Tight. - Strong.

2077
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:27,636
Please.

2078
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,238
Tight.

2079
01:16:29,238 --> 01:16:30,706
- When you sit down... - Me too.

2080
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:32,374
When you sit down, I'll tighten it up.

2081
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:35,344
We're going to get a double-check.

2082
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:38,046
- Double-check. - Double-check. Triple-check.

2083
01:16:38,046 --> 01:16:39,948
- Hold on. - Hold on.

2084
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:41,049
(Once they check, it's time to jump.)

2085
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:43,886
Be careful, sir.

2086
01:16:44,186 --> 01:16:45,554
(They check the equipment for the cowards.)

2087
01:16:45,554 --> 01:16:46,855
All ready, team.

2088
01:16:46,855 --> 01:16:48,223
How are we supposed to sit?

2089
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:49,958
Hold on.

2090
01:16:49,958 --> 01:16:52,327
- Hold on. - How do we position ourselves?

2091
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:53,996
- Keep looking up. - How do you say it in English?

2092
01:16:54,029 --> 01:16:56,565
My hands are shaking. Wait.

2093
01:16:57,132 --> 01:16:59,635
Oh, my goodness. My legs aren't touching the ground.

2094
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:02,804
(They're in mid-air.)

2095
01:17:03,338 --> 01:17:04,907
- What's this? - Dream.

2096
01:17:04,907 --> 01:17:06,909
- A little bit more. - Hold on.

2097
01:17:06,909 --> 01:17:08,076
So Wool.

2098
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:11,947
(What are we doing?)

2099
01:17:12,147 --> 01:17:13,548
So Wool.

2100
01:17:13,548 --> 01:17:18,186
Hey, hey! Hey.

2101
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,388
Hey...

2102
01:17:19,388 --> 01:17:23,225
(Cursing)

2103
01:17:23,392 --> 01:17:26,395
(This is a real situation.)

2104
01:17:30,432 --> 01:17:33,769
(They're at the descending point.)

2105
01:17:33,769 --> 01:17:34,803
Hold on.

2106
01:17:35,137 --> 01:17:40,776
(They're 160m high. The cliff is under them.)

2107
01:17:42,377 --> 01:17:43,612
Hold on.

2108
01:17:44,046 --> 01:17:45,147
Hold on.

2109
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,682
I'm doing this for you, Dream.

2110
01:17:46,682 --> 01:17:48,083
I love you, Byul.

2111
01:17:51,987 --> 01:17:53,455
I love you. I love you, Se Chan.

2112
01:17:53,622 --> 01:17:55,490
- In three... - I love you, Haha. Hold on.

2113
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:56,825
Two.

2114
01:17:56,825 --> 01:17:57,926
Two,

2115
01:17:57,926 --> 01:17:59,227
- one. - Please.

2116
01:18:00,128 --> 01:18:01,430
- Two, - Hold on.

2117
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:02,497
- one. - Please.

2118
01:18:02,497 --> 01:18:04,533
(They descend.)

2119
01:18:09,571 --> 01:18:14,843
(Groaning)

2120
01:18:17,446 --> 01:18:23,552
(They form a parabola as they go down.)

2121
01:18:23,552 --> 01:18:26,922
(It's the fiery swing.)

2122
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:28,156
Oh, my goodness.

2123
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,225
(She's terrified.)

2124
01:18:30,225 --> 01:18:31,760
Oh, my goodness. Where are they?

2125
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,161
- Where are they? - Oh, my goodness.

2126
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,668
(Their faces are distorted.)

2127
01:18:39,668 --> 01:18:42,571
It's the cliff!

2128
01:18:42,571 --> 01:18:43,972
The cliff!

2129
01:18:44,373 --> 01:18:46,375
(They run into the cliff.)

2130
01:18:46,375 --> 01:18:47,576
It's the cliff.

2131
01:18:48,577 --> 01:18:52,748
(The swing moves back before they hit it.)

2132
01:18:52,748 --> 01:18:53,949
Dream and So Wool.

2133
01:18:53,949 --> 01:18:58,053
Se Chan. Byul. Running Man. My fans.

2134
01:18:58,053 --> 01:19:01,656
Wait. Look up. Don't look down.

2135
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:06,028
My hands are numb. Look up.

2136
01:19:06,028 --> 01:19:07,329
(The swing is done now.)

2137
01:19:07,329 --> 01:19:09,331
Look at the water.

2138
01:19:10,499 --> 01:19:12,000
This is insane.

2139
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,268
My hands are numb.

2140
01:19:13,268 --> 01:19:15,604
Se Chan, I can't help you.

2141
01:19:16,038 --> 01:19:17,105
My hands are numb.

2142
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,408
They couldn't even scream.

2143
01:19:19,408 --> 01:19:20,976
They couldn't even...

2144
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:22,377
(They finally speak.)

2145
01:19:22,377 --> 01:19:23,478
This is beautiful.

2146
01:19:23,478 --> 01:19:25,147
Look down.

2147
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:28,250
Breathe.

2148
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:29,718
Breathe now.

2149
01:19:29,718 --> 01:19:31,586
(Breathe in.)

2150
01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:32,687
Do it.

2151
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:34,056
Mom.

2152
01:19:35,424 --> 01:19:37,559
You know what?

2153
01:19:37,559 --> 01:19:41,296
I've done many things in my life,

2154
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:42,764
but there's nothing as scary as this.

2155
01:19:44,499 --> 01:19:49,805
(It felt like it was never going to end, but they're done now.)

2156
01:19:51,406 --> 01:19:53,408
- Se Chan. - Near the beginning...

2157
01:19:53,408 --> 01:19:55,210
I'm still not myself.

2158
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,546
- I was so scared. - This is going to drive me nuts.

2159
01:19:57,846 --> 01:20:01,116
Running Man... I don't like you.

2160
01:20:01,116 --> 01:20:03,618
This is the penalty of your life, Haha.

2161
01:20:05,921 --> 01:20:07,956
This looks more scary. Look.

2162
01:20:07,956 --> 01:20:09,124
(It's not easy coming back up.)

2163
01:20:09,124 --> 01:20:10,959
- They look so shabby. - Oh, my goodness.

2164
01:20:10,959 --> 01:20:12,694
Look at them from the back. They look so shabby.

2165
01:20:12,894 --> 01:20:14,629
Hey, hey. My legs.

2166
01:20:14,629 --> 01:20:15,997
My hands are numb as well.

2167
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:17,866
Are we going up?

2168
01:20:17,866 --> 01:20:19,434
Yes, we are almost there. Don't look.

2169
01:20:19,434 --> 01:20:20,669
What was that?

2170
01:20:20,669 --> 01:20:22,471
(Their shoulders look weak after what they've gone through.)

2171
01:20:22,471 --> 01:20:23,672
- It's windy. - Hey.

2172
01:20:23,672 --> 01:20:25,640
I hate this sound.

2173
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,642
- Hurry. Speed it up. - Hurry. Pass.

2174
01:20:27,642 --> 01:20:29,411
- Speed it up. - Quick. Hurry up.

2175
01:20:29,411 --> 01:20:31,179
- Don't look. - Please.

2176
01:20:31,179 --> 01:20:32,747
"Speed it up."

2177
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:34,416
(They want to speed it up.)

2178
01:20:34,549 --> 01:20:35,750
(This extreme sport makes you speak English.)

2179
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:36,985
Please.

2180
01:20:37,986 --> 01:20:39,054
Please.

2181
01:20:39,054 --> 01:20:41,656
- Hurry. Speed it up. - Really.

2182
01:20:42,157 --> 01:20:43,225
All done.

2183
01:20:43,225 --> 01:20:44,292
(They hold their heads up until the end.)

2184
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:47,496
Going down is not the end.

2185
01:20:47,496 --> 01:20:49,331
(Are we finally done?)

2186
01:20:49,331 --> 01:20:50,732
My legs.

2187
01:20:51,666 --> 01:20:52,701
(Hitting)

2188
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:53,835
(My legs)

2189
01:20:53,835 --> 01:20:56,037
Wave at the camera.

2190
01:20:56,037 --> 01:20:57,839
- Good. - Good job.

2191
01:20:57,839 --> 01:20:59,508
(We're finally standing on something.)

2192
01:20:59,508 --> 01:21:01,276
Sorry. I'm sorry.

2193
01:21:01,276 --> 01:21:03,945
- I'm sorry, my brother. - Jong Kook.

2194
01:21:04,012 --> 01:21:05,247
- Okay. - That wasn't good?

2195
01:21:05,247 --> 01:21:06,515
No, that wasn't.

2196
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:07,749
That wasn't it.

2197
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:09,117
Okay, give me that.

2198
01:21:09,117 --> 01:21:11,753
- Okay. - Jong Kook.

2199
01:21:11,887 --> 01:21:14,322
My hands went numb.

2200
01:21:16,558 --> 01:21:21,096
(They've earned Jong Kook's respect.)

2201
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,831
I give you my respect.

2202
01:21:22,831 --> 01:21:24,633
(The first team successfully finishes their mission.)

2203
01:21:25,567 --> 01:21:27,702
(It's time to get ready for the second team.)

2204
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:29,905
- Sorry. - Sorry.

2205
01:21:29,905 --> 01:21:32,707
(They return in glory.)

2206
01:21:32,707 --> 01:21:34,142
Wow, fantastic.

2207
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:36,411
(He sounds excited.)

2208
01:21:37,012 --> 01:21:39,080
Encore.

2209
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,483
(They're so cool.)

2210
01:21:42,184 --> 01:21:43,285
(Everybody on land knows how great we are.)

2211
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:45,487
Nevis Swing.

2212
01:21:45,487 --> 01:21:46,688
Nevis.

2213
01:21:46,688 --> 01:21:49,357
- Swing. - I say, "Nevis", you say, "Swing".

2214
01:21:49,424 --> 01:21:50,659
Nevis.

2215
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:51,860
- Swing. - Swing.

2216
01:21:52,327 --> 01:21:53,461
Good job.

2217
01:21:53,495 --> 01:21:55,263
Where is the restroom?

2218
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:59,501
Why were you falling for so long?

2219
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:04,039
- It's not a swing. It just drops. - It's just... This is just...

2220
01:22:04,039 --> 01:22:05,540
(It's beyond your imagination.)

2221
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,042
This is really...

2222
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:10,512
The water...

2223
01:22:10,512 --> 01:22:11,947
approaches you.

2224
01:22:11,947 --> 01:22:15,383
Stop lying. You had your eyes closed.

2225
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:18,920
- You closed your eyes. - I opened them in the middle.

2226
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,988
I couldn't even scream.

2227
01:22:19,988 --> 01:22:21,856
We didn't hear you scream.

2228
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,792
You make this sound.

2229
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:25,227
(You can't even breathe.)

2230
01:22:25,227 --> 01:22:29,064
(He expressed himself with his face.)

2231
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:31,633
My goodness.

2232
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:32,767
(Now that I think about it,)

2233
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:36,605
(we're pretty great.)

2234
01:22:39,474 --> 01:22:40,609
Come here.

2235
01:22:41,209 --> 01:22:42,844
Let's pick something.

2236
01:22:43,845 --> 01:22:45,680
We have to show off.

2237
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,182
Wait. Excuse me.

2238
01:22:47,649 --> 01:22:48,950
Is this free size?

2239
01:22:49,184 --> 01:22:51,653
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook can pick a different color.

2240
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:53,488
- No, they can't pick one. - They can't.

2241
01:22:53,488 --> 01:22:55,423
They didn't go on the swing.

2242
01:22:55,423 --> 01:22:57,259
But we're here. We have to get one too.

2243
01:22:57,259 --> 01:22:58,627
- You didn't go on it. - That's mean.

2244
01:22:58,627 --> 01:23:01,029
This shirt is only for people who went on it.

2245
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:03,865
We, Nevis swingers, wear hoodies.

2246
01:23:03,865 --> 01:23:05,967
It's only for those who went on it.

2247
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:07,369
Do you want sunglasses as well?

2248
01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:09,537
Let's get everything with the swing on it.

2249
01:23:09,537 --> 01:23:10,939
- Top and bottom. - What should we do?

2250
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,108
In 1, 2, 3.

2251
01:23:13,108 --> 01:23:14,109
(Let's perform our ritual first.)

2252
01:23:14,109 --> 01:23:18,446
(Nevis swingers do the swing dance after going on the swing.)

2253
01:23:18,546 --> 01:23:19,948
(Did you see that, rookies?)

2254
01:23:19,948 --> 01:23:21,516
- Nevis. - Swing.

2255
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:23,918
(Look forward to how Jong Kook and Ji Hyo do it.)

2256
01:23:23,918 --> 01:23:25,053
Let's do it.

2257
01:23:25,053 --> 01:23:26,254
Nevis.

2258
01:23:26,254 --> 01:23:29,658
- Nevis. - Swing.

2259
01:23:29,658 --> 01:23:32,227
(If you want to be cool, follow the Nevis swingers.)

2260
01:23:33,728 --> 01:23:34,696
(Be like us.)

2261
01:23:34,696 --> 01:23:37,499
We're back again.

2262
01:23:39,267 --> 01:23:41,369
I'm so envious of how relaxed he is.

2263
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:43,338
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo get ready to descend.)

2264
01:23:43,338 --> 01:23:46,241
Both of them have such calm faces.

2265
01:23:46,975 --> 01:23:48,276
How are they so different?

2266
01:23:49,477 --> 01:23:52,213
They are incredible.

2267
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:55,583
Ji Hyo, I love you. Jong Kook, I love you.

2268
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:57,786
Don't worry. Even I did it.

2269
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,754
It's comforting, right?

2270
01:24:00,255 --> 01:24:01,323
(Nodding)

2271
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:03,658
In middle...

2272
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:04,993
In the middle...

2273
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,329
As you come up,

2274
01:24:07,329 --> 01:24:10,498
you should yawn a few times.

2275
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:12,867
You will want to yawn.

2276
01:24:12,867 --> 01:24:15,136
You will want to yawn. Make sure you yawn.

2277
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:20,542
It looks like Jong Kook is a bit nervous.

2278
01:24:20,542 --> 01:24:22,410
It's impossible not to be nervous.

2279
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:23,945
I am really nervous.

2280
01:24:23,945 --> 01:24:25,447
- You are nervous, right? - Yes. I am scared.

2281
01:24:25,447 --> 01:24:27,949
(They become nervous when they face the swing.)

2282
01:24:27,949 --> 01:24:29,651
I am trembling once again.

2283
01:24:30,985 --> 01:24:32,987
(I am trembling once again now that I am here.)

2284
01:24:32,987 --> 01:24:34,656
- Are you okay? - What?

2285
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:36,891
- Are you okay with being here? - I can do this.

2286
01:24:36,891 --> 01:24:38,026
- Like a man... - Don't do that.

2287
01:24:38,026 --> 01:24:39,260
Like a man, I will watch them go.

2288
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,029
You will get yourself killed. Come here.

2289
01:24:41,029 --> 01:24:42,530
(Come on.)

2290
01:24:42,530 --> 01:24:43,665
Take your words back.

2291
01:24:43,665 --> 01:24:44,733
I take my words back.

2292
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:46,968
I don't want you to die.

2293
01:24:46,968 --> 01:24:48,737
(Come here, Se Chan.)

2294
01:24:48,737 --> 01:24:50,772
I became scared again. This is driving me crazy.

2295
01:24:51,639 --> 01:24:53,341
- Do you have a lip balm? - Come here.

2296
01:24:53,341 --> 01:24:55,443
- Be quiet. - It's okay.

2297
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:57,278
- Let's hold each other tight. - Let's hold each other tight.

2298
01:24:57,278 --> 01:24:58,313
- That's right. - Hold on tight.

2299
01:24:58,346 --> 01:24:59,814
Watching others do it makes me scared too.

2300
01:24:59,814 --> 01:25:00,815
- All right. - All right.

2301
01:25:00,815 --> 01:25:02,817
- Are you guys ready? - Yes.

2302
01:25:02,817 --> 01:25:04,319
All right. All right.

2303
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:05,387
There they go.

2304
01:25:06,187 --> 01:25:08,356
All right. Come on in.

2305
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:09,457
There they go.

2306
01:25:09,457 --> 01:25:10,525
Haha, come here.

2307
01:25:10,525 --> 01:25:12,026
(They finally face the cliff.)

2308
01:25:12,026 --> 01:25:13,528
My goodness.

2309
01:25:13,528 --> 01:25:15,697
- My goodness. - Come all the way up.

2310
01:25:15,697 --> 01:25:17,365
You got this.

2311
01:25:17,365 --> 01:25:19,334
Turn around back towards me.

2312
01:25:19,334 --> 01:25:20,568
- Are you guys all right? - All right.

2313
01:25:20,568 --> 01:25:21,870
Keep going backwards.

2314
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:24,706
(They even turn around.)

2315
01:25:24,706 --> 01:25:25,974
- Backwards? - Are they riding it backwards?

2316
01:25:25,974 --> 01:25:27,108
Are you riding it backwards?

2317
01:25:27,108 --> 01:25:28,777
(What is going on?)

2318
01:25:29,344 --> 01:25:31,279
They are crazy.

2319
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:34,115
(Are they riding it backwards?)

2320
01:25:34,816 --> 01:25:36,017
There.

2321
01:25:36,017 --> 01:25:37,085
(Laughing)

2322
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:38,553
(Why is he laughing?)

2323
01:25:38,553 --> 01:25:39,854
Haha, come here.

2324
01:25:39,854 --> 01:25:41,723
Do you guys realize what you are doing...

2325
01:25:41,723 --> 01:25:43,525
is the most extreme way?

2326
01:25:45,126 --> 01:25:46,961
- Yes, I heard. - Cool.

2327
01:25:46,961 --> 01:25:49,631
(It's the most extreme way of riding the swing.)

2328
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:51,266
- My goodness. - Good luck.

2329
01:25:51,266 --> 01:25:54,202
(Have a safe trip.)

2330
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,571
Oh, my goodness.

2331
01:25:56,938 --> 01:25:58,640
All right. Take a step back.

2332
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:00,341
Are they really going to do this?

2333
01:26:00,809 --> 01:26:01,776
Sit back.

2334
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:04,045
(I hope they will be okay.)

2335
01:26:04,646 --> 01:26:06,080
- All right. - I hope you find it a good one.

2336
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,549
All right.

2337
01:26:07,549 --> 01:26:09,117
- Behind? Okay. - We are all set.

2338
01:26:09,117 --> 01:26:11,252
- All right. Take a seat. Get comfy. - Sit.

2339
01:26:11,252 --> 01:26:13,354
(The fearless duo is ready for the drop.)

2340
01:26:13,354 --> 01:26:14,456
Take a seat. Get comfy.

2341
01:26:14,456 --> 01:26:18,626
- Sit. Just sit. - Yes. Just sit.

2342
01:26:18,626 --> 01:26:20,528
(The 1st stage is letting the swing support your weight.)

2343
01:26:20,528 --> 01:26:21,996
- My palms are sweating. - Are you ready?

2344
01:26:21,996 --> 01:26:23,131
All right. Okay.

2345
01:26:23,131 --> 01:26:24,199
(The 1st stage is letting the swing support your weight.)

2346
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:26,935
Are you ready? I want to explain how to get upside down.

2347
01:26:26,935 --> 01:26:29,637
What's going to happen is, I want to raise you up higher.

2348
01:26:29,637 --> 01:26:31,406
When you are out there, you are going to lean back.

2349
01:26:31,406 --> 01:26:34,008
Your legs are going to come around the outside of the straps.

2350
01:26:34,008 --> 01:26:35,877
Around. Then lock the position.

2351
01:26:35,877 --> 01:26:37,445
- Our legs. Okay. - Yes.

2352
01:26:37,445 --> 01:26:39,247
- Your legs. Go wide. - Okay.

2353
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:40,915
You can come up that way.

2354
01:26:40,915 --> 01:26:42,617
- Are you guys ready? - All right.

2355
01:26:42,617 --> 01:26:45,787
(After the explanation, only the drop remains.)

2356
01:26:45,787 --> 01:26:47,288
They are so brave.

2357
01:26:47,655 --> 01:26:49,123
Well, go upside down.

2358
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:50,124
- Upside down? - Yes.

2359
01:26:50,124 --> 01:26:51,459
- Right now? - Yes.

2360
01:26:51,459 --> 01:26:52,460
- Okay. - How will you do that?

2361
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,395
(Go upside down.)

2362
01:26:54,729 --> 01:26:56,764
- Right now? - Yes.

2363
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:59,200
(Do they need to lie down in the air?)

2364
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,502
- Inside? - What are they doing?

2365
01:27:00,502 --> 01:27:02,036
Then the other leg.

2366
01:27:02,036 --> 01:27:03,571
- It doesn't work for me. - Inside?

2367
01:27:03,872 --> 01:27:05,106
Look at them.

2368
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,175
- Like this? - I can't watch.

2369
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:08,710
- This is crazy. - Look at them.

2370
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:11,079
(The 1st stage is leaning back in the air.)

2371
01:27:11,079 --> 01:27:12,814
- This is crazy. - Link your feet to the swing.

2372
01:27:13,348 --> 01:27:14,816
- Why would you do that? - Ji Hyo, link your feet.

2373
01:27:14,816 --> 01:27:16,751
- Like this? Is this okay? - Did I do it right?

2374
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:17,752
- This foot? - No, it's the other way.

2375
01:27:17,752 --> 01:27:19,621
Push and turn just like that.

2376
01:27:19,621 --> 01:27:21,289
Okay.

2377
01:27:21,289 --> 01:27:23,157
- What are they doing? - Like this.

2378
01:27:23,157 --> 01:27:24,726
All right. Now, let's go.

2379
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:28,096
- This is crazy. - Jong Kook, this is really scary.

2380
01:27:28,263 --> 01:27:29,397
Here they go.

2381
01:27:30,064 --> 01:27:31,466
(Laughing)

2382
01:27:31,466 --> 01:27:33,635
- He is laughing. - Are you guys ready?

2383
01:27:33,635 --> 01:27:35,136
Yes, we are ready.

2384
01:27:35,136 --> 01:27:37,505
(Are you guys ready?)

2385
01:27:37,505 --> 01:27:38,773
Yes.

2386
01:27:39,674 --> 01:27:45,113
(They face the worst fear in the most extreme position.)

2387
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:49,250
(The countdown starts.)

2388
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,351
- Three. - Okay.

2389
01:27:51,386 --> 01:27:52,487
Two.

2390
01:27:53,788 --> 01:27:54,856
One.

2391
01:27:56,257 --> 01:27:58,459
(Get ready...)

2392
01:27:58,459 --> 01:27:59,460
One.

2393
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,397
(and shoot.)

2394
01:28:03,998 --> 01:28:05,066
One.

2395
01:28:09,003 --> 01:28:12,273
(This isn't a work of computer graphics.)

2396
01:28:15,043 --> 01:28:19,013
(His jaw drops.)

2397
01:28:19,013 --> 01:28:20,281
Did we do that?

2398
01:28:20,615 --> 01:28:21,783
Oh, my goodness.

2399
01:28:26,754 --> 01:28:29,023
(Hanging upside down, they swing down the cliff.)

2400
01:28:34,095 --> 01:28:36,030
My goodness.

2401
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:38,299
(It's time to swing back.)

2402
01:28:38,299 --> 01:28:40,401
My goodness.

2403
01:28:40,935 --> 01:28:43,304
We're falling for way too long.

2404
01:28:44,739 --> 01:28:47,342
(Laughing)

2405
01:28:47,342 --> 01:28:48,876
(It's more fun to ride the swing upside down.)

2406
01:28:48,876 --> 01:28:51,245
This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable.

2407
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:53,548
- Respect! - Big respect!

2408
01:28:53,548 --> 01:28:54,816
Big respect!

2409
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:56,884
Hero! My hero!

2410
01:28:57,819 --> 01:28:59,687
I bet blood will rush to their heads.

2411
01:29:00,121 --> 01:29:02,156
How do I say that in English?

2412
01:29:02,156 --> 01:29:04,559
Haha, how do I say that in English?

2413
01:29:04,559 --> 01:29:07,261
Blood puke.

2414
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:08,329
Puke?

2415
01:29:09,464 --> 01:29:11,366
Blood puke.

2416
01:29:11,366 --> 01:29:12,500
(I am right.)

2417
01:29:14,002 --> 01:29:15,236
(Their faces are red...)

2418
01:29:15,236 --> 01:29:16,237
This is hilarious.

2419
01:29:16,237 --> 01:29:19,907
(because blood rushed to their heads.)

2420
01:29:19,907 --> 01:29:21,576
(That's why this is the most extreme position.)

2421
01:29:21,576 --> 01:29:22,644
I feel dizzy.

2422
01:29:26,914 --> 01:29:28,616
Did they tell us to sit on our way up?

2423
01:29:28,616 --> 01:29:29,684
Did they?

2424
01:29:30,918 --> 01:29:32,553
- Shall we try sitting up? - Shall we?

2425
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:33,554
Let's go.

2426
01:29:33,554 --> 01:29:35,223
(Struggling)

2427
01:29:36,457 --> 01:29:38,793
Jong Kook, this is much better.

2428
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,395
Gosh, I felt like I was dying.

2429
01:29:40,628 --> 01:29:42,697
- We're going up. - It's beautiful down there.

2430
01:29:43,665 --> 01:29:44,732
This is incredible.

2431
01:29:45,066 --> 01:29:48,169
(They now notice the beautiful scenery below them.)

2432
01:29:48,169 --> 01:29:50,705
I can see the scenery now.

2433
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:53,274
I couldn't see it earlier since blood was rushing to my face.

2434
01:29:54,409 --> 01:29:55,877
How was it? Was it good?

2435
01:29:55,877 --> 01:29:59,647
- It was incredible. - It was incredible.

2436
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:02,517
Jong Kook, the first drop was really scary, right?

2437
01:30:02,517 --> 01:30:04,819
When we fell upside down...

2438
01:30:04,819 --> 01:30:06,254
(He laughs until the end.)

2439
01:30:06,254 --> 01:30:07,855
I could only laugh.

2440
01:30:08,456 --> 01:30:09,891
He is laughing. He is laughing again.

2441
01:30:09,891 --> 01:30:10,992
What's so funny about that?

2442
01:30:11,059 --> 01:30:12,126
Aren't you scared now?

2443
01:30:12,126 --> 01:30:14,629
- Why is he laughing? - Did you yawn?

2444
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:17,165
- We are fine. - We are fine now. At the bottom,

2445
01:30:17,365 --> 01:30:20,001
we couldn't open our eyes because blood rushed to our heads.

2446
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:21,235
- Ji Hyo. - Yes?

2447
01:30:21,235 --> 01:30:23,104
You are truly the ace.

2448
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,206
- They can do anything. - You put me to shame.

2449
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,009
You are the ace, and I'm the Nevis.

2450
01:30:28,009 --> 01:30:29,577
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's extreme ride is a success.)

2451
01:30:30,878 --> 01:30:31,879
Good job.

2452
01:30:31,879 --> 01:30:34,115
(We have so much respect for you.)

2453
01:30:34,115 --> 01:30:36,117
(With Jong Kook and Ji Hyo completing the penalty...)

2454
01:30:36,117 --> 01:30:37,752
It's indescribable, right?

2455
01:30:37,985 --> 01:30:39,420
Thank you.

2456
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,456
(All 4 members of Team New Zealand clear the mission.)

2457
01:30:41,456 --> 01:30:43,024
Ji Hyo, you are incredible.

2458
01:30:43,224 --> 01:30:44,392
It was unbelievable.

2459
01:30:45,259 --> 01:30:46,294
You will get the hoodie now.

2460
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:47,528
- Haha. - Hoodie!

2461
01:30:47,528 --> 01:30:49,530
- I will get the hoodie now. - Yes.

2462
01:30:50,098 --> 01:30:51,766
This is touching.

01:30:54,135 --> 01:30:56,504
The Nevis Swing penalty is completed.

2465
01:30:56,504 --> 01:30:58,873
(The Nevis Swing penalty is completed.)

2466
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:00,208
Finally!

2467
01:31:00,341 --> 01:31:03,845
We are finally done with it.

2468
01:31:04,078 --> 01:31:06,814
- Number 26. - Number 27.

2469
01:31:06,881 --> 01:31:08,015
Number 30.

2470
01:31:08,382 --> 01:31:09,450
31.

2471
01:31:10,017 --> 01:31:11,319
- Nevis... - Nevis...

2472
01:31:11,919 --> 01:31:12,987
- Swing! - Swing!

2473
01:31:13,454 --> 01:31:16,891

Same Money, Different Dreams Race.

2475
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,461
(Same Money, Different Dreams?)

2476
01:31:21,028 --> 01:31:24,065
(Everyone is given a suitcase that is filled with money.)

2477
01:31:24,632 --> 01:31:25,867
(Decide whether to empty the suitcase...)

2478
01:31:25,867 --> 01:31:27,401
(or fill the suitcase.)

2479
01:31:27,668 --> 01:31:31,205
(Emptying saves the team, and filling saves an individual.)

2480
01:31:31,205 --> 01:31:33,674
(The money-related dilemma is endless.)

2481
01:31:34,308 --> 01:31:36,210
(In this race,)

2482
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,079
(everything is about money...)

2483
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:40,214
(and for money.)

2484
01:31:40,214 --> 01:31:41,816
(Decide between the victory of an individual...)

2485
01:31:41,816 --> 01:31:43,317
(and the victory of the team.)

2486
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:44,619
(What lies at the end of this dilemma?)
