1
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:12,320
(Asia Culture Center, Gwangju)

2
00:00:12,322 --> 00:00:16,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:17,990
- Ji Hyo.
- Hello.

4
00:00:17,994 --> 00:00:19,060
You are here, Ji Hyo.

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:20,760
Hello, Jong Kook.

6
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:21,760
Go away.

7
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,830
(Jong Kook is sulking.)

8
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,230
- Hello, Jong Kook.
- No, go away.

9
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:28,200
- She didn't relate to your story.
- It's not like that.

10
00:00:28,204 --> 00:00:30,370
She had no reason to give me "Poor".

11
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:34,010
(The story goes back 2 weeks.)

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,440
(During the Christmas Special,
So Min rated his story "Poor".)

13
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:38,880
I couldn't relate to it.

14
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:41,280
(She couldn't relate to him then.)

15
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:43,950
It wasn't that bad.

16
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:47,020
Perhaps my explanation was
a bit lacking.

17
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:49,290
You are talking
about excellent, fair, and poor.

18
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:52,160
- If she had a justifiable reason...
- I had forgotten about it.

19
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:54,360
It's all in the past.

20
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,730
Do you understand her?

21
00:00:55,732 --> 00:00:56,800
- I don't.
- He holds grudges.

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,400
It's possible that
she didn't relate to your story.

23
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,500
- That's funny.
- He is scary.

24
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:03,300
- I had forgotten about it.
- He holds grudges.

25
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,670
- So many days have passed.
- A week has passed.

26
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:07,510
So Min, take a fist to your face
and get it over with.

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,740
(So Min, take a punch
and get it over with.)

28
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,180
(It's better that way
since Jong Kook holds grudges.)

29
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,850
Take a fist to your face,
and get it over with.

30
00:01:12,449 --> 00:01:16,150
Jong Kook catches a cold
and gets his feelings hurt easily.

31
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,650
(There is a soft heart
behind the muscles.)

32
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,680
He gets his feelings hurt
very easily.

33
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,220
I see that...

34
00:01:21,925 --> 00:01:23,420
Kwang Soo only looks handsome
with a nice hairstyle.

35
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,860
(The comment comes out of nowhere.)

36
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:26,960
(Why is he bringing this up?)

37
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:28,960
That came out of nowhere.

38
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,460
- Seok Jin.
- I can't believe you.

39
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,560
You are talking nonsense.

40
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:32,830
Kwang Soo only looks handsome
with a nice hairstyle.

41
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,670
With that hairstyle,
he reminds me of Chil Deuk.

42
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,700
- Chil Deuk is back.
- What are you talking about?

43
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,000
Come on.

44
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:41,310
He has that hairstyle...

45
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,480
because he enrolled somewhere
in drama.

46
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,710
(His hairstyle has nothing to do
with his fashion sense.)

47
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:46,310
When I got out of the car,

48
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:48,250
every staff members said,
"What's wrong with your hair?"

49
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:51,320
"Are you trying to be funny?"
Everyone had a comment.

50
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:53,950
- He isn't handsome anymore.
- Your face is enough.

51
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:55,690
Kwang Soo,
you don't need to do more.

52
00:01:55,692 --> 00:01:57,060
- You look funnier.
- What do you mean?

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,860
- You look funnier now.
- What do you mean by that?

54
00:01:59,529 --> 00:02:01,390
- I mean...
- Look at Kwang Soo.

55
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:02,530
This is a cool hairstyle.

56
00:02:02,532 --> 00:02:04,700
All right.
This is the first episode...

57
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,900
of the new year.

58
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:08,540
It's especially cold this winter.

59
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:10,200
- We came to Gwangju,
- Yes.

60
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:11,570
- the city of lights.
- The city of lights.

61
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:12,840
Gwangju, the city of lights.

62
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:17,410
It's the biggest cultural center
in Asia that is located in Gwangju,

63
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:19,450
Asia Culture Center.

64
00:02:20,116 --> 00:02:21,910
Today, you will have a race here...

65
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:23,990
to welcome 2018,
the Year of the Golden Dog...

66
00:02:24,154 --> 00:02:26,950
with the penalty
of bathing your body on the line.

67
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,650
This is the Gold Pouch Race,
the Mysterious Stone Pouch.

68
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,760
There are 4 Gold Pouches
and 4 Stone Pouches.

69
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:35,160
You will choose a pouch.

70
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,900
All members with the Stone Pouches
at the end of the race...

71
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:39,930
will have the penalty
of bathing your body.

72
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:42,630
The members who win
in each mission...

73
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,370
will receive advantages
for the race.

74
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,410
Okay.

75
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,810
However, among you are
two members with Hands of Stone...

76
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:53,280
who can change a Gold Pouch
into a Stone Pouch...

77
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,680
through the hidden mission.

78
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:59,850
(There are 2 members
with Hands of Stone.)

79
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,260
I told you.

80
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:03,590
If everyone's Gold Pouch...

81
00:03:03,593 --> 00:03:05,090
turns into Stone Pouch,

82
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,630
Team Hands of Stone wins...

83
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,700
and the rest of the members
receive the penalty.

84
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:11,960
If there is a member
with a Gold Pouch,

85
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:16,270
those with Hands of Stone and
Stone Pouches receive the penalty.

86
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,300
However, while there are
two members with Hands of Stone,

87
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:22,210
they don't know each other.

88
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:23,340
They don't know each other.

89
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:26,750
If a member with Hands of Stone
performs...

90
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:29,550
the hidden mission on the other,

91
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:31,020
his or her Stone Pouch
will change into the Gold Pouch.

92
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,880
They need to spot each other.

93
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:34,690
- They need to spot each other.
- That's right.

94
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:38,160
What happens if the two members
are Jong Kook and So Min?

95
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:39,790
Will it be okay?

96
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,830
- My goodness.
- If they are Jong Kook and So Min,

97
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:43,600
will So Min be able to do
the mission?

98
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,630
They know, but they pretend
not to know.

99
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:48,530
- Even if they know,
- I got goosebumps.

100
00:03:48,538 --> 00:03:49,530
they will feign ignorance.

101
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,840
So Min is hiding next to Kwang Soo.

102
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:53,910
(She is avoiding Jong Kook.)

103
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,180
- She stuck her head out.
- She is avoiding Jong Kook.

104
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,480
Thank goodness she is a woman.
If she was a guy,

105
00:03:59,682 --> 00:04:01,120
he would've killed her.

106
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:05,090
When will Jong Kook and Kwang Soo
receive the penalty?

107
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,480
- It got postponed.
- They will receive it today.

108
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,920
- I see.
- We should receive it today.

109
00:04:08,157 --> 00:04:09,950
- Today?
- We should.

110
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,220
Please pick a pouch.

111
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,230
- Okay.
- Okay.

112
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,260
- Pick the one in the front.
- Okay.

113
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,400
Okay. Move out of the way.

114
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,900
- I am choosing.
- Move out of the way.

115
00:04:19,903 --> 00:04:20,970
(The member with a Stone Pouch
at the end,)

116
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,640
I will take the last one.

117
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,970
- I made a choice.
- I am not sure about my choice.

118
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:27,140
(They will be penalized.)

119
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,780
(The ace member, Ji Hyo, has...)

120
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,710
(a Gold Pouch.)

121
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,890
(So Min has a Gold Pouch.)

122
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:39,450
All right.

123
00:04:39,455 --> 00:04:41,320
(Jong Kook and Haha)

124
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:43,320
(Both of them have Gold Pouches.)

125
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:45,390
I am not lucky.

126
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,760
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan have Stone Pouches.)

127
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,760
(So Min, Haha, Ji Hyo, and Jong Kook
have Stone Pouches.)

128
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:52,500
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo,
and Se Chan have Stone Pouches.)

129
00:04:52,635 --> 00:04:54,570
A Stone Pouch changes
into a Gold Pouch...

130
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:57,270
when the two members
with Hands of Stone change it.

131
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:58,440
- Yes.
- So Min.

132
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,540
(You are suspicious.)

133
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:03,340
This mission is for you.

134
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,710
Are Ji Hyo and So Min doing this?

135
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,080
(Are they the ones
with Hands of Stone?)

136
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:07,950
No, Jae Seok. I don't have them.

137
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:09,220
- You don't?
- No.

138
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,750
- I think...
- Ji Hyo and So Min...

139
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:12,880
(Seeing how you're naming us...)

140
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,460
I have a feeling Jae Seok might be
one of the Hands of Stone.

141
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:19,960
Yes, I do.

142
00:05:20,496 --> 00:05:23,060
(Is he acting? Is he revealing
his identity from the start?)

143
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:27,700
(This morning,
30 minutes before the shoot)

144
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:30,340
Are you giving me another mission?

145
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
My last mission wasn't long ago.

146
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:35,340
You are 1 of the 2 members who have
Hands of Stone that can change...

147
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:37,880
the gold in members' pouches
into stone.

148
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,650
(Jae Seok is 1 of 2 members
with Hands of Stone.)

149
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,220
Jae Seok, your hidden mission is...

150
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,080
stepping on members' feet.

151
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,880
(This hidden mission can change
the gold into stone.)

152
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,090
I need to step on their feet?

153
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,690
(They catch on quickly. It won't be
easy to step on their feet.)

154
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:52,820
That's too difficult.

155
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,030
(They catch on quickly. It won't be
easy to step on their feet.)

156
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,530
(He has no time to waste.
He starts from the opening.)

157
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,900
No, the pouch changes from
what you have.

158
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,000
The Stone Pouch can change
to a Gold Pouch, right?

159
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,640
(He steps on Se Chan's foot.)

160
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,000
My gosh, these shoes.

161
00:06:03,706 --> 00:06:04,910
- So that's...
- Goodness.

162
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,340
My gosh, these shoes.

163
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:09,140
(He steps hard on Se Chan's foot.)

164
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,280
What are you doing?

165
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,580
You need to get
your new shoes stepped on.

166
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:15,580
- They are new. I must step on them.
- Jae Seok.

167
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:17,650
(He accomplishes his mission,
but Se Chan has a Stone Pouch.)

168
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,890
(Jae Seok can't change
his pouch into a Gold Pouch.)

169
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,190
(Place for the Year
of the Golden Dog's first mission)

170
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,830
(Wait.
This indoor set looks like...)

171
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,060
- Wait.
- This set is quite intriguing.

172
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,070
I know what this is.

173
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:32,400
Fortune-telling.

174
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,200
For this mission,

175
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:35,900
your fortune for the new year
will be interpreted.

176
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,070
After having your fortune
for 2018 read,

177
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,570
you will be paired with a member
that's most compatible with you...

178
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,270
and proceed with the mission.

179
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:43,780
(The members will be matched with
those most compatible to them.)

180
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,010
So Min knows a lot
about fortune-telling.

181
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,950
- I like having mine read.
- She gets into this.

182
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,950
- Fortune-telling of five elements.
- Right, she has them read.

183
00:06:50,019 --> 00:06:51,450
- Fortune-telling of five elements.
- What is that?

184
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:54,750
- Fire, gold, tree, water, and soil.
- I see, I see.

185
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:55,960
- People do get them read.
- Right.

186
00:06:56,626 --> 00:06:58,020
My fortune is of the tree.

187
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,690
Seok Jin, I'm compatible
with someone of the tree.

188
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:01,330
- I thought you were of the gold.
- Yes, my fortune is of the gold.

189
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,960
- Why are you...
- So let me elaborate.

190
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,560
When gold meets water,

191
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:08,200
- it depends on the size of water.
- Is that why...

192
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:09,630
(For some reason...)

193
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,340
If gold meets a big puddle of water,
it will sink, but if water is...

194
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,710
Are you going to read
our fortune today?

195
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:16,340
- Are you going to read ours?
- Go sit over there. Go.

196
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,780
- What's gold not compatible with?
- It's fire.

197
00:07:18,781 --> 00:07:19,940
I guess I'm fire.

198
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,810
(That means I must be of the fire.)

199
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,380
I must be quite a big fire.

200
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,750
I must be burning up.

201
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:27,320
Fiery Jong Kook.

202
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,890
Call me Fiery Jong Kook from now on.

203
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,260
(It could be true or not.)

204
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:33,520
All right. Then let us
introduce you...

205
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,460
a fortune-teller, Park Sung Jun
who will read your fortunes.

206
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,200
- Gosh.
- He's back again.

207
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,830
- I saw him on TV.
- Hello.

208
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't like him.

209
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,200
- I saw him on TV.
- I don't like him.

210
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:43,570
My gosh, you're back again.

211
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:45,270
- Thank you for coming so far.
- I saw him on TV.

212
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:46,710
Didn't you collapse last year?

213
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,140
I'm going to...

214
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,650
I'm going to take off my shoes
and sit this year.

215
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,640
- Seok Jin must go first.
- He told you not to do anything.

216
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:54,810
- Last year...
- My goodness.

217
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:57,320
- He said not to do anything.
- This year...

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
- I'm looking forward to 2018.
- Stuck to the ground.

219
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:02,250
- Seok Jin's fortune must be good.
- I hope my fortune is great.

220
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,260
- It's about time.
- Yes, 2018 will be his year.

221
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,460
- Hello.
- Hi.

222
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:06,630
- Long time no see.
- Hi.

223
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,460
This is...

224
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:09,890
from an analysis, right?

225
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,630
Yes, I look at yin and yang along
with the elements.

226
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:12,930
- You're not making this up, right?
- No.

227
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,330
These tell me
about the person's disposition...

228
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:19,010
and the environment
of his or her fortune.

229
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:22,570
- Birthdays determine the elements.
- They are all different?

230
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,010
Yes. So for you, Seok Jin,

231
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,010
you are a solid rock.

232
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:27,650
- A rock? Like a stone?
- Yes.

233
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,880
- Really?
- He's a speculum metal then.

234
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,950
I really hope his fortune is
better than last year's.

235
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:33,890
- Do you remember last year's?
- Yes.

236
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:35,750
- It can't be worse than that.
- Right.

237
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:37,120
You told me not to start anything.

238
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:38,390
You told him to do nothing.

239
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,960
(Seok Jin's last year's fortune
wounded him deeply.)

240
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:46,100
(His fortune said that Seok Jin
must not try to do anything.)

241
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,970
(What kind of fortune
will 2018 bring Seok Jin?)

242
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,070
- For the last two years,
- Yes?

243
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:52,170
you did a great job
of holding yourself back.

244
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,580
You did a great job
of holding yourself back.

245
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:57,340
- 2 years? He waited for 2 years?
- My goodness.

246
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:59,910
(Lady Luck will be
on my side now at last!)

247
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,220
- 2 years? He waited for 2 years?
- What did he say? What?

248
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,120
- Goodness.
- Things are looking up for him.

249
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,620
Gosh, this sounds...

250
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,250
- quite hopeful.
- Things will go his way now.

251
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:08,390
It's finally here.

252
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,720
(Will he be successful now?)

253
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:10,890
- So now...
- Yes?

254
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:13,860
(So now...)

255
00:09:13,863 --> 00:09:15,760
you can wait one more year.

256
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,600
(You can wait 1 more year.)

257
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,970
(We knew it!)

258
00:09:22,405 --> 00:09:24,100
(Darn it!)

259
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,970
- How much more must he wait?
- I must wait more?

260
00:09:25,975 --> 00:09:27,940
- He's the funniest.
- Seok Jin, you're almost there!

261
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,340
- You're almost there!
- You can do it.

262
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:30,540
- Seok Jin.
- It's almost over.

263
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,010
You waited for two years.

264
00:09:32,014 --> 00:09:33,610
Waiting for one more year
isn't that hard.

265
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,480
Exactly.
You're almost there, Seok Jin.

266
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,220
- One more year.
- This will be over soon.

267
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,650
However,

268
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:41,490
good things will start happening
to you from 2020.

269
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:42,920
- He has a long way to go.
- That's so far away.

270
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,020
- That's too far in the future.
- He still has a lot left.

271
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:45,430
- I must wait for 2 years, not 1.
- Right.

272
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:47,760
- 2020?
- That's so far away.

273
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:48,890
2020?

274
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:50,460
Then you will be over 60 by then.

275
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:52,600
If you wait diligently
for one more year,

276
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:54,970
things will begin to move
in your favor.

277
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:58,270
- It'll be time for you to prepare.
- He can finally get moving.

278
00:09:58,274 --> 00:09:59,370
- He can start crawling now.
- Right now,

279
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,840
he can crawl around.

280
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,710
Things are beginning
to look better for him.

281
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:05,810
By the way,

282
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:08,880
will I have some luck
in the offspring department?

283
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:11,720
(By the way, will I have some luck
in the offspring department?)

284
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:12,920
Why are you asking that, Seok Jin?

285
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,360
- What? Why?
- Why are you asking that, Seok Jin?

286
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,320
Are you guys trying?

287
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,060
- No.
- Last year...

288
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:21,290
I just find babies
insanely adorable these days.

289
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:22,600
Well,

290
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:25,630
- your luck regarding children...
- Okay.

291
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:26,660
If were to discuss this,

292
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,600
your luck will stay with you
until the first half of next year.

293
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,840
- So we may be able to conceive?
- Yes.

294
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:34,410
- What about after next year?
- We can't conceive after that?

295
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,370
After next year,
his luck will thin out.

296
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,110
- Is that so?
- He's going to get weaker.

297
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:41,410
How can he get weaker from this?

298
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,450
- He's going to get weaker? Really?
- Hold on.

299
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,990
I don't think you know me well.

300
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,520
In your fortune, you may get weaker
in the course of time.

301
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,090
(Whatever!)

302
00:10:53,095 --> 00:10:54,730
He's going to lose energy
and get weaker.

303
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,860
- Come back to your spot.
- Seriously.

304
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,200
Seok Jin, come back to your spot.

305
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:03,270
(This year's fortune left him
scarred again.)

306
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,270
(Seok Jin's fortune for 2018)

307
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:08,010
(April showers bring May flowers,)

308
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,840
(but it will happen after 2 years.)

309
00:11:09,912 --> 00:11:12,010
- My fortune was the best last year.
- Yes, Kwang Soo's was the best.

310
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,510
- Mine was the best last year.
- Really?

311
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:15,510
- Mine and Kwang Soo's was the best.
- Right.

312
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:18,120
- Kwang Soo had a haircut.
- Look forward to yours.

313
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,780
- Kwang Soo, are you sick?
- I'm curious about mine too.

314
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:20,920
What?

315
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:23,250
- It could've changed his fortune.
- You look sick.

316
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:24,830
No, no. Hello.

317
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,160
- He even acts strange.
- I don't think it will be good.

318
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:28,290
(They keep commenting on his hair.)

319
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:29,860
- I liked his back, long hair.
- Why did he cut his hair?

320
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:31,360
Kwang Soo, you should get
some extensions.

321
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,130
I will get mine read later.

322
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,970
(I will get mine read later.)

323
00:11:35,972 --> 00:11:37,130
- I'll do it later.
- No, no.

324
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,300
- What?
- Okay, okay.

325
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:39,740
- We'll be quiet.
- You'll be fine.

326
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,110
(You'd better not speak a word.)

327
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:45,350
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

328
00:11:46,382 --> 00:11:48,210
You only have an entrance,
but no exit.

329
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:49,380
(You only have an entrance,
but no exit.)

330
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:50,510
What does he mean?

331
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,880
(You only have an entrance,
but no exit.)

332
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:55,320
it means that things can go in,
but never come out, right?

333
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:56,820
What does that mean?

334
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,730
What did you mean by that?

335
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:01,430
You have a lot of thoughts,
and your mind is clustered,

336
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,390
but since you can't express them.

337
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,830
You feel frustrated and annoyed.

338
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:07,730
You aren't like an average person.

339
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:09,700
When these elements coincide
with loneliness,

340
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:14,540
you may show
some signs of a pervert.

341
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:15,710
He went out of the line.

342
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:17,480
My gosh!

343
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:18,910
Yes, he's a pervert.

344
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:20,540
(The revelation brings shock
to everyone.)

345
00:12:20,549 --> 00:12:22,580
A pervert? A pervert.

346
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,850
Don't you think he's being too mean?

347
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:27,050
But he really surprised me.

348
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:28,920
His interpretation is spot on.

349
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,690
- How could he say this?
- Only we know that he's a pervert.

350
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:34,460
- What are you saying?
- This was our secret.

351
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:36,230
I'm sure some people may know,
but...

352
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:37,630
I'm not a pervert.

353
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:38,800
(Let's keep it a secret.)

354
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,870
You're not a complete pervert.

355
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:43,130
Your looks...

356
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,370
aren't of the typical pervert.

357
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:47,510
(Your looks aren't
of the typical pervert.)

358
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,640
He's not a typical pervert.

359
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,840
Should I be relieved?

360
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,950
His looks are average.

361
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,780
That's why...

362
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:55,650
I could say that
he's somewhat of a pervert.

363
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:56,750
- Somewhat of a pervert?
- Yes.

364
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,920
I just meant that you have
a unique way of thinking.

365
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:01,350
- It's not a bad thing.
- Okay. I see.

366
00:13:01,357 --> 00:13:03,690
First off, your fortune for 2018...

367
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:05,920
is the brightest.

368
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:07,360
(2018 is the brightest year
for him.)

369
00:13:07,363 --> 00:13:09,560
- His drama will be a hit then.
- His drama will be successful.

370
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:11,360
Is he going to be
as successful as Joong Ki?

371
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:12,600
(Can he be with Joong Ki now?)

372
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:14,440
- Is it a good year for me?
- Yes.

373
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:19,970
This year is the brightest
before the sunset.

374
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:21,240
In other words...

375
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:22,610
Before the sunset?

376
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,380
Wait.

377
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,950
The sun has been up only
for a short while.

378
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:28,820
The sun has been up only
for a short while.

379
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,380
Your last moment.

380
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:35,020
(It's his last moment
before the sunset.)

381
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:37,560
- "Last moment"?
- Is he trying to be funny?

382
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,290
- I had a feeling about this.
- No, no.

383
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,160
- He's the funniest.
- "Last moment".

384
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,260
Let me elaborate.

385
00:13:42,264 --> 00:13:45,570
You will burn the last flame
you have left in you,

386
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,530
- Already?
- so it's the brightest for you.

387
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,970
I'm only 33.

388
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:49,970
(Is that good or bad?)

389
00:13:49,972 --> 00:13:51,340
How could I have my last moment?

390
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:54,000
Later on, in your early 40s,

391
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,480
you will have great fortune.

392
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:58,950
The great fortune you had
for past 3 or 4 years...

393
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:02,510
will continue until early next year.

394
00:14:02,518 --> 00:14:04,120
Then your flame will start
to dim a bit.

395
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,520
(He's shocked.)

396
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:07,820
I'll have my last moment? Already?

397
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,250
- Things will be better at 41.
- Right.

398
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,830
Things will be better for you at 41.

399
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,790
Hey, Seok Jin has to wait
this year again.

400
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,230
I keep waiting.

401
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:17,200
Among the members of Running Man,

402
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:19,400
there's someone who can give you...

403
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,500
affection and warmth.

404
00:14:21,504 --> 00:14:23,300
- Okay. One member?
- Yes.

405
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,770
That member is...

406
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:27,040
(There's someone who can give me
affection and warmth?)

407
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,270
So Min.

408
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,440
What?

409
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:32,340
- So Min...
- It's me?

410
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,280
and Kwang Soo share similar traits.

411
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:36,780
So Min is affectionate
and warmhearted.

412
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,120
- That's how she is.
- Okay.

413
00:14:38,154 --> 00:14:40,920
That's why when you and So Min meet,

414
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,460
- you are quite compatible.
- My gosh.

415
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:45,190
I'm like his lucky charm.

416
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:47,590
The Best Couple Award goes to...

417
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,290
Lee Kwang Soo and Jeon So Min.

418
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:54,970
(Is it because of the fortune?
We make a good couple.)

419
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:58,540
Hey, you guys should give it a try.

420
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:01,940
Only So Min can improve
your luck for the next six years.

421
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:04,180
Only So Min can improve
your luck for the next six years.

422
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,810
Be nice to me.

423
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:07,780
He should read So Min's fortune too.

424
00:15:07,783 --> 00:15:09,150
Okay.

425
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:12,490
But the problem is that only you
will benefit from the relationship.

426
00:15:12,721 --> 00:15:15,190
It's not going to benefit So Min.

427
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,190
- See?
- It's not going to benefit you.

428
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,190
- Let's have dinner together.
- Forget it.

429
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,460
I mean it.

430
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:24,200
Is it not going to
benefit me at all?

431
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,730
If you two become a couple,

432
00:15:27,536 --> 00:15:29,540
you'll have to look after
Kwang Soo as if he was your son.

433
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:32,500
You'll have to continue
giving in to him.

434
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:33,600
- You have to help him out.
- It seems so.

435
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:36,540
So Min has to keep helping
Kwang Soo out.

436
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,980
She has to look after him.

437
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,780
Kwang Soo doesn't have
good dating skills.

438
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:43,610
What do you know?

439
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,650
(My fortune talks
about my dating skills?)

440
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,280
Dating skills are...

441
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:48,390
- irrelevant. Aren't they?
- Does that come out?

442
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,550
- Psychological...
- Isn't this his personal opinion?

443
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm talking about
psychological skills.

444
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,260
- They are weak.
- His psychological skills?

445
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:55,260
- He has poor skills.
- He's impatient.

446
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:56,460
You're his dating coach.

447
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:59,030
I'm his coach.
He has such poor skills.

448
00:15:59,034 --> 00:16:01,270
My skills have become worse
because of you.

449
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,970
Without me, his skills would be
even worse.

450
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,540
Let me tell you a good thing.

451
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:10,110
This year and next year, you have
the highest chance of...

452
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:12,140
meeting the love of your life
in the coming 10 years.

453
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:16,280
(He has a high chance of
meeting the love of his life.)

454
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,880
- You're mine
- You're mine

455
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,190
He'll probably get married.

456
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,090
Why are you looking at So Min?

457
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,860
- While talking about love...
- That's not why I looked at her.

458
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,590
You might meet your future wife.

459
00:16:27,596 --> 00:16:29,490
- My future wife?
- Yes.

460
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,230
He's now old enough to get married.

461
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,360
- It's about time he got married.
- Yes.

462
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,270
Joong Ki got married too.
Kwang Soo likes to copy him.

463
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,300
Exactly.

464
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,870
He has nothing to do with this.

465
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:39,370
(I won't get married
just to copy Joong Ki.)

466
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,110
This year,

467
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,910
- you might meet someone.
- I see.

468
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,310
- That's a good thing.
- Yes.

469
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:47,720
- You're lucky this year.
- Yes.

470
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,350
Thank you.

471
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,650
It's a lucky year for you.
That's what's important.

472
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:52,850
- Okay.
- It's your last year.

473
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:54,150
(Kwang Soo's fortune for 2018)

474
00:16:54,156 --> 00:16:55,520
(It'll be a brilliant year.)

475
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:57,590
(Spend your last lucky year
with So Min.)

476
00:16:57,926 --> 00:16:59,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:06,570
Your birthday has energy of...

478
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,740
- It's small gold, right?
- gold.

479
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,630
- Small gold.
- That's right.

480
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,100
You can compare it to...

481
00:17:12,107 --> 00:17:15,980
jewels or a sharp metal.

482
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,440
You think too much and get
submerged in your thoughts.

483
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:22,080
- You worry a lot too.
- That's right.

484
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:24,390
I'd say you're...

485
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,420
half Jae Seok...

486
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,920
and half Kwang Soo.

487
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:31,190
(Half Jae Seok and half Kwang Soo)

488
00:17:31,193 --> 00:17:32,190
That's the worst.

489
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,720
Should she sit between the two?

490
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:36,930
- You have both our strengths.
- Collaboration.

491
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,230
You're like a gift set.

492
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,170
You're not average.

493
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,970
You're creative, but
you can sometimes be a bit weird.

494
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,870
You think a lot and have a lot
going on in your head.

495
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,910
- You're also very conservative.
- I am.

496
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,980
If you hadn't become an actress,

497
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:54,080
- you would have enjoyed teaching.
- A teacher?

498
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:57,210
- That's true.
- A teacher would suit you too.

499
00:17:57,219 --> 00:18:01,420
Someone told me I would have
become even more successful.

500
00:18:01,724 --> 00:18:04,730
Teaching gives you...

501
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,520
a sense of superiority
and satisfaction.

502
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:08,560
That's why I'm not lucky with guys.

503
00:18:08,564 --> 00:18:11,430
I tend to try to lecture guys,
and they don't like it.

504
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,600
You're lecturing him right now.

505
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:16,070
You're lecturing him.

506
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:19,070
You're talking more than him.

507
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,680
I'm sorry.

508
00:18:23,078 --> 00:18:25,980
Guys tend to... How is my love life?

509
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:29,950
Your future husband will be
like a parent.

510
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:32,750
You want a man...

511
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:35,450
who can look after you...

512
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,690
- like a parent.
- That's right.

513
00:18:37,693 --> 00:18:39,790
You'd make a nice couple...

514
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,030
- with Se Chan too.
- Really?

515
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,430
(She'd make a nice couple
with Se Chan.)

516
00:18:43,432 --> 00:18:46,200
- I'm the one that got away.
- No matter how much you fight,

517
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:47,400
you will never break up.

518
00:18:47,803 --> 00:18:51,170
If you get married,
you won't be able to get divorced.

519
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,600
That's bad.

520
00:18:53,609 --> 00:18:55,210
- Because we can't get divorced?
- You can't get divorced.

521
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,040
- That's bad?
- That's bad.

522
00:18:57,112 --> 00:19:00,310
You'll be inseparable.

523
00:19:00,315 --> 00:19:02,020
(They'll be inseparable.)

524
00:19:02,084 --> 00:19:03,580
You'll stick together like taffy.

525
00:19:03,752 --> 00:19:04,980
That sounded weird.

526
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:06,450
They'll be inseparable.

527
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:07,950
- I was surprised.
- Like taffy.

528
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:10,290
- They'll stay together like taffy.
- They'll stay together like taffy.

529
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:12,090
You'll be obsessed with each other.

530
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,760
I like that.

531
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,600
She's a pro at obsessing.

532
00:19:16,298 --> 00:19:17,660
- Thank you.
- No problem.

533
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:18,760
Thank you so much.

534
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,870
(So Min's fortune is not
entirely satisfying.)

535
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,800
(So Min's fortune for 2018)

536
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:24,570
(She could have become
a teacher too.)

537
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:25,900
(Don't try to lecture guys.)

538
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:28,040
- Se Chan.
- Is it my turn?

539
00:19:28,243 --> 00:19:29,970
- Go.
- It's your turn.

540
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,550
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

541
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,380
(I'm nervous.)

542
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:37,820
You're very different
from the other members.

543
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,780
You have the energy of fire.

544
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,520
- Fire?
- It's a huge fire.

545
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:43,890
- A huge fire?
- Yes.

546
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:48,030
I'd like to talk about
Haha and Jong Kook...

547
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,490
in relation to your fortune.

548
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:52,900
When you're with Jong Kook,

549
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:56,100
there's stress you can't avoid.

550
00:19:56,104 --> 00:19:57,940
(When Se Chan is with Jong Kook,)

551
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,000
(there's stress he can't avoid.)

552
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:02,670
That's accurate.

553
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:05,010
- How can...
- Are you saying that on purpose?

554
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,810
How can you see through that?

555
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,480
- How...
- How...

556
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:10,010
Do you watch Running Man often?

557
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:12,350
- I understand what that means.
- Seriously.

558
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,490
Really?

559
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:16,490
You can never change it.
It's your destiny.

560
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:18,790
I'd say that.

561
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,060
Will it be like that all my life?

562
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:21,930
The unsatisfactory man.

563
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,830
- Stress is your destiny.
- Stress is your destiny.

564
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:24,930
(Stress is your destiny.)

565
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,500
You have to accept it.

566
00:20:26,502 --> 00:20:27,700
- Accept it.
- Accept it.

567
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:30,300
(Is it really destiny?)

568
00:20:30,305 --> 00:20:31,700
- I have to accept it?
- Accept it.

569
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:33,240
- We'll always be together.
- Of course.

570
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:37,510
Haha is the one who can
relieve your stress.

571
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,040
I knew it.

572
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,510
- Nevis.
- Nevis Swing.

573
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:41,580
Swing.

574
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:45,590
Haha is moist land.

575
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:48,520
- He has a lot of moisture.
- He's very emotional.

576
00:20:48,524 --> 00:20:50,820
- I'm moist.
- He's emotional.

577
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,820
When a huge fire meets moist land,

578
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:55,430
it calms down.

579
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:58,030
When Jong Kook gives him stress,

580
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,500
he relieves it by talking to Haha.

581
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,970
I'm the one who connects the two.

582
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,570
- Yes.
- We're a good match.

583
00:21:04,573 --> 00:21:06,140
- We are.
- Of course.

584
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:09,740
It seems like you'll be lucky
in the coming years.

585
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:13,510
Look ahead 4 to 5 years.

586
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,980
You'll become...

587
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,750
luckier and luckier.

588
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:18,850
That's great.

589
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,820
- That's great.
- I love it.

590
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,350
(Se Chan's fortune for 2018)

591
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:23,920
(Man of Fire)

592
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:25,890
(Accept your stress in 2018.)

593
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

594
00:21:29,565 --> 00:21:31,630
- Ji Hyo.
- Why am I nervous?

595
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,240
Of the five elements,
you have the energy of wood.

596
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,940
Wood? I think you said that
last year too.

597
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,670
- Ji Hyo is wood?
- She's wood.

598
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:42,470
In the past two years,

599
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:46,010
you've been lucky with guys.

600
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:49,050
From now on,
you'll be lucky with money.

601
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,850
I'll be lucky with money?

602
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:54,090
You'll be even pickier this year.

603
00:21:54,256 --> 00:21:56,020
No man can satisfy you.

604
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,720
(No man will satisfy her this year.)

605
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:01,830
This year too?

606
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:03,560
- This year too?
- That's a problem.

607
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,770
She should meet a man soon.

608
00:22:07,603 --> 00:22:08,940
I see.

609
00:22:09,004 --> 00:22:11,000
You become even pickier with guys.

610
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:13,770
When you look for a man,

611
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:16,340
you look for someone
you can look up to.

612
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:17,480
That's right.

613
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,580
There is a problem.

614
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
(The problem is...)

615
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:22,680
It's that there are very few men
you can look up to.

616
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:27,720
(There are very few men
she can look up to.)

617
00:22:28,156 --> 00:22:29,250
Gosh.

618
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:31,460
You said that last year too.

619
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,090
Although you'll be luckier
with money than with guys...

620
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,500
this year,

621
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:39,560
you'll still have some luck
until March or April.

622
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:41,570
You might meet someone.

623
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,870
There's not much time left.

624
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,270
- March or April?
- Yes.

625
00:22:45,273 --> 00:22:46,770
(If it's March or April...)

626
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:48,240
How is it between me and Jong Kook?

627
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,340
You said some good things
about him and me last year.

628
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:51,780
Suddenly...

629
00:22:52,047 --> 00:22:53,750
Why...

630
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,350
Isn't this a confession of her love?

631
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,020
(Last year's fortune telling)

632
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,990
(Ji Hyo was dry wood last year too.)

633
00:23:04,993 --> 00:23:07,890
(You're always thirsty
for something.)

634
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:11,570
(Jong Kook is a huge water.)

635
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,800
(Are Ji Hyo and Jong Kook
a perfect match?)

636
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:17,240
As a couple...

637
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:20,300
A tree born in the summer
needs water.

638
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:22,710
As Jong Kook is a huge water,

639
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:26,540
he can help you grow.

640
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:29,750
(I'm thirsty, Jong Kook.)

641
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,820
(Jong Kook would feel burdened.)

642
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,090
He feels burdened.

643
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,790
I have to be careful
until March or April.

644
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,920
(Beware of Ji Hyo
in the first quarter of the year.)

645
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:41,230
Until the end of April...

646
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,630
I'd give your match...

647
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:50,200
85 to 95 points out of 100.

648
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:51,200
(That's great.)

649
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:52,740
- That's a lot.
- That's great.

650
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:54,270
(Shocked)

651
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:56,640
(Thank you for your nice words.)

652
00:23:57,045 --> 00:23:58,280
(Ji Hyo's fortune for 2018)

653
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,810
(March will be a romantic month.)

654
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,820
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo
would make a great couple.)

655
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,010
(It's Ji Hyo's huge water,
Jong Kook's turn.)

656
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

657
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,850
Jong Kook...

658
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:12,260
(What does the new year
have in store for Jong Kook?)

659
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,330
You are always dissatisfied
and make risky moves.

660
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,260
(Jong Kook will be dissatisfied
and make risky moves.)

661
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:20,430
- Me?
- Yes.

662
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:23,400
You'll be dissatisfied
and make risky moves.

663
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:27,670
You should try not to make
risky moves.

664
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:29,010
I'll try.

665
00:24:29,111 --> 00:24:31,110
This year,

666
00:24:31,113 --> 00:24:32,780
you'll go through many changes.

667
00:24:32,948 --> 00:24:34,980
Your mindset changes,

668
00:24:35,117 --> 00:24:36,650
and you want to change.

669
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:39,190
You might move to another place...

670
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:42,020
or change workplaces.

671
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:44,720
Jong Kook has been
talking about that...

672
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:45,930
for the last few years.

673
00:24:45,961 --> 00:24:47,330
This year,

674
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:48,960
you're lucky with girls too.

675
00:24:48,964 --> 00:24:51,090
(He's lucky with girls.)

676
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:53,330
- Finally.
- He's getting married.

677
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:55,500
- Please.
- That's the best thing.

678
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:56,800
Girls?

679
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:59,000
(Will I finally meet someone?)

680
00:24:59,007 --> 00:25:00,070
You'll meet many women.

681
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,610
(He'll meet many women.)

682
00:25:01,943 --> 00:25:03,340
- Many?
- Many?

683
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:04,940
- Is it many?
- He waited for a long time.

684
00:25:04,946 --> 00:25:06,310
You'll meet countless women.

685
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:07,780
- Countless women?
- Goodness.

686
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:09,380
You should meet women.

687
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,150
- Countless women?
- Countless women?

688
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:12,550
It's okay for you to do that.

689
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:15,620
You should meet
so that you can find someone.

690
00:25:15,757 --> 00:25:18,050
Based on your fortune in changes,

691
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,660
you could move to a new house
as you meet a new woman.

692
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:24,530
- What's this?
- It's marriage.

693
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,600
It sounds like marriage.

694
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,530
It's likely a marriage.

695
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:29,370
Really?

696
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:33,500
You have a lot of fortune
in moving and changes.

697
00:25:33,508 --> 00:25:36,340
If I'm in a situation to move,
is it better to move?

698
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:38,910
- You should move this year.
- Really?

699
00:25:39,614 --> 00:25:40,980
It's finally time, Jong Kook.

700
00:25:41,216 --> 00:25:44,980
As your desire for
money and women get strong,

701
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:47,850
you may find stability and changes
as you meet someone.

702
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,820
If you move accordingly,
things will turn out well.

703
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,330
- Okay, sir.
- He'll have many changes.

704
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:55,530
- Goodness.
- That sounds good.

705
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:57,290
(Jong Kook's fortune for 2018)

706
00:25:57,299 --> 00:25:59,260
(It is a year of changes and
luck with women.)

707
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,700
(Please get married this year.)

708
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,330
(How about Haha's fortune in 2018?)

709
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,010
In 2016 and 2017, compared to
the amount of work you did,

710
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,010
the results weren't as good.

711
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:13,010
That's right. It's true.

712
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,480
- He worked very hard.
- Right.

713
00:26:14,482 --> 00:26:16,150
Why are you smiling?

714
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:18,820
However, in 2018...

715
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:23,550
(His career wasn't the best
during the past two years.)

716
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:26,090
(How about in 2018?)

717
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:29,930
The result of your work
will be worse.

718
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:33,000
Gosh, wait a minute.

719
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:37,770
Compared to 2016 and 2017,
will it be worse in 2018?

720
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:40,970
Will it be worse? I'm sorry, Haha.

721
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,210
(When will he be rewarded?)

722
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,310
- My goodness.
- Pardon me?

723
00:26:46,114 --> 00:26:49,350
You have the worst fortune.

724
00:26:49,718 --> 00:26:50,820
What I mean is...

725
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,420
(He's knocked down.)

726
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,260
(It must be painful for Haha.)

727
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,330
Help him get up. Haha.

728
00:27:01,796 --> 00:27:03,000
He lost strength.

729
00:27:03,064 --> 00:27:05,000
- Come on, Haha.
- Get up.

730
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
- Haha.
- It's only a start.

731
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,730
It's only the beginning, Haha.

732
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:09,970
- It's only the beginning.
- No way.

733
00:27:09,971 --> 00:27:13,340
His bad fortune this year
doesn't make me laugh.

734
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:15,580
Do you mean my career
in TV broadcasting?

735
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,810
I mean in various fields...

736
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:19,210
- including TV broadcasting.
- Like what?

737
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:22,080
The moment before the sun rises
is the darkest.

738
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,310
Your fortune is like pitch darkness.

739
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,320
(His fortune is pitch dark.)

740
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:31,860
However, you start to see
the end of the dark, long tunnel.

741
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,600
Once you pass it,
you'll be able to breathe.

742
00:27:36,164 --> 00:27:38,760
I think that...

743
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:43,100
you'll be very fortunate
in 3 to 4 years.

744
00:27:43,104 --> 00:27:47,140
If you endure this year,
things will be great afterwards.

745
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,380
The only source of strength
to help you endure bad fortune...

746
00:27:52,814 --> 00:27:56,150
- is your children.
- Right.

747
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:58,080
- Dream and Soul.
- He always thinks about family.

748
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:00,220
- They're Dream and Soul.
- That's right.

749
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:04,290
I'll take a look at
when you'll be fortunate.

750
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,590
- He feels bad for Haha.
- Right.

751
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:09,030
He wants to tell him
something positive.

752
00:28:09,965 --> 00:28:12,600
(Let's see.)

753
00:28:13,768 --> 00:28:15,870
In 2022...

754
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:21,910
(2022 is 4 years later.)

755
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,610
That's years later.

756
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:27,610
When you're 44, 45, or 46 years old,

757
00:28:27,615 --> 00:28:29,080
you'll be very fortunate.

758
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:30,350
That's good.

759
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,480
That's a good thing.

760
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:35,020
It's better to be fortunate
when you're older.

761
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,250
- He's right.
- In 2022?

762
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,050
- Keep working hard.
- It's better this way.

763
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,160
He's right.

764
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:40,590
(Haha's fortune for 2018)

765
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,490
(Life starts when you're older.)

766
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:44,000
(Look forward to 2022.)

767
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:47,330
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

768
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,340
Your fortune in money is
quite stable...

769
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,670
and well stocked.

770
00:28:54,743 --> 00:28:57,970
Your fortune says that you adapt
well to various circumstances...

771
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:02,550
and make smart maneuvers
in earning money.

772
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,020
You also like to
dig deep into things,

773
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,180
so you hold money in both hands.

774
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,350
You try to protect what you have,

775
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:13,160
and you prefer
certainty and stability.

776
00:29:13,161 --> 00:29:16,530
However, you'll want to
start something new this year.

777
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:18,900
- Really?
- How did he know?

778
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:21,270
We should open up
an organic bakery, Jae Seok.

779
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,970
- How about an organic bakery?
- Seok Jin...

780
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,500
- keeps insisting on that.
- It's time.

781
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,670
He suggested opening up
Grasshopper Bakery.

782
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:29,780
He's been saying that for years.

783
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,740
This year is the time to
open up an organic bakery.

784
00:29:32,747 --> 00:29:37,520
As I said last year, Seok Jin
and bread don't go well together.

785
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,220
(If bakery doesn't work...)

786
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,480
He won't be lucky with bakeries.

787
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:44,050
How about
an organic food restaurant?

788
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,290
- Does it exist?
- Organic won't work for you.

789
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:49,360
If Seok Jin starts
a business like a bakery,

790
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,300
he should sell low-cost products
that aren't healthy but cheap.

791
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,760
- Like junk food?
- That's right.

792
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,170
You should keep to distribution.

793
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,300
- Distribution?
- Manufacturing won't work.

794
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,470
Don't manufacture.

795
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:01,510
Come on, don't say that.

796
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:07,910
You'll want to start new things
this year.

797
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,480
I suggest that you follow
such desires...

798
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:14,350
- this year.
- Okay.

799
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,320
It's similar to mine.

800
00:30:15,323 --> 00:30:17,350
Right, it's similar to Jong Kook's.

801
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:18,860
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

802
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,590
- Goodness.
- You always have good fortune.

803
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,190
(Jae Seok's fortune for 2018)

804
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,060
(Everything is okay as long as
he avoids Seok Jin.)

805
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,600
(Don't open an organic bakery.)

806
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:32,540
(Couple selection result)

807
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,840
Here's the current status
of pouches.

808
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,440
Even though the Hands of Stone...

809
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,940
- completed their mission...
- Really?

810
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:40,040
(Gold gets changed to Stone.)

811
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:43,350
(Although Hands of Stone
were successful...)

812
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:45,480
the gold hasn't changed.

813
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:47,450
- They must have chosen incorrectly.
- Right.

814
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:49,250
(The number of stones
hasn't changed.)

815
00:30:49,257 --> 00:30:51,590
- They did their mission?
- When did they do it?

816
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,330
Nothing happened.

817
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:54,790
When did they do it?

818
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:57,060
(He definitely stepped on
Se Chan's foot.)

819
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:03,000
(That means Se Chan was stone
from the beginning.)

820
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,970
Seok Jin came early
to the waiting room.

821
00:31:08,977 --> 00:31:11,210
During the prior round,

822
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:13,340
Seok Jin and Jong Kook
massaged other members.

823
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:14,480
I'm not suspecting you.

824
00:31:14,482 --> 00:31:16,150
Seok Jin had his elbow on me.

825
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:18,750
He moved it while
pretending to lean on me.

826
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:19,980
- Really?
- He's here.

827
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:21,920
Seok Jin made me feel
electricity on my hand.

828
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,350
- A massage?
- Electricity.

829
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,720
- Was it a massage?
- I was just playing.

830
00:31:25,727 --> 00:31:27,490
I wouldn't be that obvious.

831
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:29,360
You haven't massaged us once
in eight years.

832
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:31,690
He's never done it
in the last eight years.

833
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:32,800
Let him do it.

834
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:36,470
It's certain that
Seok Jin received a mission,

835
00:31:36,471 --> 00:31:38,800
but we don't know
what the mission is.

836
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:39,870
Where have you been?

837
00:31:40,742 --> 00:31:41,810
Are you massaging me again?

838
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,340
It's because it's fun
to see your reaction.

839
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:45,410
You must be one of them.

840
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:48,880
- What's that?
- What is it?

841
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,850
What do we have here?

842
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:52,550
- What is it?
- My goodness.

843
00:31:52,554 --> 00:31:56,760
(Is it a stepping-stone set
with a water puddle?)

844
00:31:56,991 --> 00:31:59,060
It's a game of falling in the water.

845
00:31:59,194 --> 00:32:01,330
There are jumping boards.

846
00:32:01,663 --> 00:32:02,660
(There are four jumping boards.)

847
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,760
We have to fall in the water.

848
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,730
(Shall I change some gold
into stones?)

849
00:32:07,735 --> 00:32:09,370
It's per couple.

850
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:11,800
- Is it an individual game?
- We won't win today, Haha.

851
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:14,070
(Hands of Stone Jae Seok succeeds.)

852
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,040
We won't win today, Haha.

853
00:32:16,044 --> 00:32:18,310
- Kwang Soo.
- Jong Kook has advantage today.

854
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:20,510
- That's great.
- What did you say?

855
00:32:20,515 --> 00:32:22,350
- What's your color?
- Mine is orange.

856
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:23,980
Why are you taking it?

857
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:25,250
I just took one.

858
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:27,920
Stop being obvious
in clearing your mission.

859
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:30,190
No, I wouldn't be this obvious.

860
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:32,430
I've worked with you over 20 years,

861
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,760
but you never massaged my shoulder.

862
00:32:34,762 --> 00:32:36,060
- I know.
- Seriously.

863
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:37,760
- He's never touched me before.
- I do it because you enjoy it.

864
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:39,930
Why do you keep massaging us...

865
00:32:39,968 --> 00:32:41,200
while looking in this direction?

866
00:32:41,202 --> 00:32:43,530
- It's because...
- It's very strange.

867
00:32:43,538 --> 00:32:45,740
Why do you look in this direction
while clearing the mission?

868
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,070
I'm doing it for fun.

869
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:48,110
(Just admit it.)

870
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:51,910
Let's start a couple's game called
Skipping Piggyback Ride.

871
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:53,510
Piggyback?

872
00:32:54,716 --> 00:32:56,320
The four couples start together.

873
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:58,790
With one partner
on the other's back,

874
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:00,350
you skip the stepping stones.

875
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:04,020
The last couple to arrive at
the destination wins.

876
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,760
- The last couple?
- The last?

877
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,630
The one getting a piggyback ride
chooses a finger from 1 to 5.

878
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:12,060
If you pick a number that
coincides the most,

879
00:33:12,066 --> 00:33:15,270
the couple skips
the stepping stones accordingly.

880
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:18,670
The couple to arrive at
the water puddle loses.

881
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:20,300
If you arrive at the jumping board,

882
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:22,310
half the number of members
must go in the water.

883
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,510
(Half the members
at the jumping board must go in.)

884
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:26,980
(1 of the 2 must go in the water.)

885
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:29,450
That means one of us
goes in the water.

886
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,910
It'll be me, won't it?

887
00:33:30,918 --> 00:33:32,920
- Really? Okay.
- Gosh.

888
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,520
Please go to your places.

889
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:38,760
- It's the winning team last year.
- Okay.

890
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

891
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:40,990
We can do it.

892
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,790
- Good fortune cross.
- Good fortune cross.

893
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:44,590
- We miss U Ie.
- We miss U Ie.

894
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,900
(We miss U Ie.)

895
00:33:48,469 --> 00:33:50,330
- Good fortune, let's be happy.
- Good fortune, let's be happy.

896
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:51,600
(How about this?)

897
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:53,070
- What?
- What should we do?

898
00:33:53,808 --> 00:33:55,170
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

899
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,470
- Kook.
- That's enough.

900
00:33:56,477 --> 00:33:59,180
Min, siblings.

901
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:02,710
- You should play along.
- He hates it.

902
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:04,180
Where did that come from?

903
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,050
- "Kook Min siblings"?
- What was that?

904
00:34:06,054 --> 00:34:08,820
- It makes no sense.
- She took them from their names.

905
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,820
Kook Min siblings.

906
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:12,890
(She tries again.)

907
00:34:12,894 --> 00:34:14,460
What is she doing?

908
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:17,530
(That couple will be funny today.)

909
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:20,730
One partner gets on
the other's back.

910
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:22,870
Choose who will get
a piggyback ride.

911
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,000
- Three.
- Ji Hyo is light.

912
00:34:26,007 --> 00:34:27,110
(Se Chan gives a ride.)

913
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:31,240
(Seok Jin is older yet strong.)

914
00:34:32,013 --> 00:34:33,010
Hold tight.

915
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:34,180
(They're weak.)

916
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:37,380
It's great to see
So Min and Jong Kook together.

917
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:39,050
Don't we look close?

918
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,490
(Goodness)

919
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:44,360
(Ji Hyo is way over here.)

920
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:46,390
All right. One.

921
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:48,320
(The last couple to arrive
at the puddle wins.)

922
00:34:48,329 --> 00:34:49,360
Two.

923
00:34:49,364 --> 00:34:52,030
(They must choose a number
that doesn't coincide.)

924
00:34:56,738 --> 00:34:58,810
(They both choose 3.)

925
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,040
(Jong Kook and So Min, Seok Jin and
Haha must skip 3 stepping stones.)

926
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,240
How many stepping stones?

927
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,670
2 teams must skip 3 stepping stones.

928
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,210
- For goodness' sake.
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

929
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:06,780
- Okay! Okay!
- That's a lot.

930
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:08,920
Kwang Soo.

931
00:35:10,218 --> 00:35:11,950
(Their reactions are as varied
as their fortunes.)

932
00:35:11,953 --> 00:35:14,550
- This is crazy.
- It hurts a lot.

933
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:18,360
(The moment they move,
the suffering begins.)

934
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:20,890
(Round 2 arrives
when they are in pain.)

935
00:35:20,895 --> 00:35:21,990
Let's go.

936
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:23,160
One.

937
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:26,000
Two.

938
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,670
Okay, okay.

939
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,410
We are safe.

940
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:38,710
Gosh, you are heavy.

941
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:40,510
Don't say that.

942
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:42,580
- My goodness.
- Don't say that.

943
00:35:43,384 --> 00:35:45,150
(Is the acupressure mat painful,
or is Ji Hyo heavy?)

944
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:46,690
My goodness.

945
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:48,320
Stop pressing down on me.

946
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:49,690
I am not doing anything.

947
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:51,820
Let's go.

948
00:35:51,826 --> 00:35:53,490
This is the beginning.

949
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:58,160
For goodness' sake.

950
00:35:58,466 --> 00:36:00,530
- This is crazy.
- You must endure it.

951
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,730
You must endure it.

952
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:03,170
I know it's painful,
but you must endure it.

953
00:36:03,304 --> 00:36:04,470
Hurry up.

954
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:06,040
It's okay.

955
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,710
- Step on it.
- For goodness' sake.

956
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:09,640
- A little bit more.
- Hurry up.

957
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,380
Okay, okay.

958
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:13,080
The last one.

959
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,010
Okay.

960
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,210
Hurry up.

961
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:17,280
(It hurts a lot.)

962
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,220
In 1, 2,

963
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,790
(These are how many steps
the teams have left.)

964
00:36:25,326 --> 00:36:26,460
Did you pick?

965
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:29,530
It's over for them.

966
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:31,360
(Either Jong Kook or So Min
must dive.)

967
00:36:31,365 --> 00:36:32,630
Okay. We are still in the game.

968
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:34,600
Let's go.

969
00:36:34,602 --> 00:36:37,570
So Min and I should never be
on the same team.

970
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:39,040
- 4.
- 4.

971
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,070
- 5.
- 5. Okay.

972
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:41,140
Let me down.

973
00:36:41,943 --> 00:36:43,580
Step aside.

974
00:36:43,678 --> 00:36:44,940
(Step aside, So Min.)

975
00:36:44,946 --> 00:36:46,180
Is it okay if Se Chan let me down?

976
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:48,010
(Step aside so that I can dive.)

977
00:36:48,716 --> 00:36:50,280
What are they doing this time?

978
00:36:50,284 --> 00:36:52,420
Jong Kook cold act is a pretense.

979
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:54,820
He looks after So Min.

980
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:56,620
- Come on out.
- What are they doing?

981
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,420
Why are you trying to go
into the water?

982
00:36:58,426 --> 00:37:00,090
- Let me.
- Come on out. I will go in.

983
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:01,820
His cold act is a pretense.

984
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:03,360
(He treats her warmly.)

985
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,630
- His cold act is a pretense.
- Come on out.

986
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,130
I will go into the water.

987
00:37:07,134 --> 00:37:08,460
(He jumps into the cold water.)

988
00:37:08,469 --> 00:37:10,800
- Jong Kook.
- Don't go into the water.

989
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:13,170
What is going on?

990
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:15,670
Don't say that.
I went in because I could.

991
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:17,210
I don't think
I will be able to sleep easily.

992
00:37:17,345 --> 00:37:19,410
I am reminded of something.

993
00:37:19,413 --> 00:37:21,580
I saw a couple fight viciously...

994
00:37:21,582 --> 00:37:22,950
before they suddenly began to kiss.

995
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:26,820
Isn't that what they are doing?

996
00:37:29,557 --> 00:37:30,890
What are you doing?

997
00:37:30,892 --> 00:37:32,560
It feels like a party.

998
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,320
(It feels like a party.)

999
00:37:34,328 --> 00:37:35,760
That came out of nowhere.

1000
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,330
(He brings up a party
out of nowhere.)

1001
00:37:37,832 --> 00:37:38,960
That came out of nowhere.

1002
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,300
It's a party.

1003
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:42,370
- It's beautiful.
- I know.

1004
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,400
Seok Jin's team is out...

1005
00:37:45,406 --> 00:37:47,240
if they pick a coinciding number.

1006
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,410
Let's go.

1007
00:37:48,442 --> 00:37:49,710
Pick carefully.

1008
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,340
One.

1009
00:37:51,345 --> 00:37:52,840
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan
have 5 steps left.)

1010
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:53,940
Two.

1011
00:37:53,948 --> 00:37:55,250
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo
have 5 steps left.)

1012
00:37:55,716 --> 00:37:56,780
All right.

1013
00:37:56,784 --> 00:38:00,250
(Seok Jin and Haha pick 5.)

1014
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:02,360
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan pick 4.)

1015
00:38:06,427 --> 00:38:07,690
For goodness' sake.

1016
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:09,590
(Seok Jin and Haha
and Jae Seok and Kwang Soo pick 5.)

1017
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,160
- What is it?
- We must advance five steps.

1018
00:38:11,198 --> 00:38:12,300
Did we win?

1019
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,100
Yes, you did.

1020
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:15,800
Okay. Let's play
rock-paper-scissors.

1021
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:16,900
- What?
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1022
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:18,570
Let's have one team enter the water.

1023
00:38:18,573 --> 00:38:20,140
(Half of them must enter the water.)

1024
00:38:20,141 --> 00:38:21,440
- Yes.
- We need two people.

1025
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:23,640
2 out of 4 people
must enter the water.

1026
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,070
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

1027
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,410
Rock-paper-scissors

1028
00:38:30,384 --> 00:38:32,550
- I dodged it.
- You should have played scissors.

1029
00:38:32,787 --> 00:38:34,220
You should have played scissors.

1030
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,760
(Kwang Soo decides for them.)

1031
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,660
Come here.

1032
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:46,400
(Come here.)

1033
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,770
(Running away)

1034
00:38:50,004 --> 00:38:51,630
Catch him.

1035
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,970
Two people entered the water.

1036
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:55,740
Jong Kook, would you call him?

1037
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:57,340
Enter the water.

1038
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:58,570
I don't have to do that.

1039
00:38:58,579 --> 00:38:59,910
- Hurry up.
- What?

1040
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,520
- Hey!
- Hey!

1041
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:04,050
Hold on.

1042
00:39:05,786 --> 00:39:06,980
Where is Jae Seok?

1043
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:08,220
For goodness' sake.

1044
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:09,320
Hey.

1045
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:10,890
(He hides to apprehend
the rule breaker.)

1046
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:11,990
Catch him.

1047
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:13,820
Come here.

1048
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,190
Two people entered the water!

1049
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:16,930
- Hurry up.
- Two people entered the water!

1050
00:39:17,264 --> 00:39:18,330
Hold on.

1051
00:39:18,332 --> 00:39:19,530
(Splashing)

1052
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,100
Hold on.

1053
00:39:22,136 --> 00:39:24,570
(It's cold.)

1054
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,810
It's Gollum. It's Gollum.

1055
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,840
(His hair reminds people of Gollum.)

1056
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:36,850
- Look at his hair.
- He looks like Gollum.

1057
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:39,120
(Kwang Soo isn't here.)

1058
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,720
Kwang Soo, do something
about your hair.

1059
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:42,120
Kwang Soo, fix your hair.

1060
00:39:42,123 --> 00:39:43,290
(I am angry.)

1061
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:49,030
(I can put Jae Seok and Seok Jin
back into the water.)

1062
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:51,830
(Slipping)

1063
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,100
(He falls down.)

1064
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:01,470
(Slapstick comedy makes the best
the New Year's greeting.)

1065
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:03,880
Is he a fool?

1066
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:05,340
Is he a fool?

1067
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:06,880
Kwang Soo.

1068
00:40:09,283 --> 00:40:12,120
(He falls down again.)

1069
00:40:12,153 --> 00:40:13,520
Look at Kwang Soo's hair.

1070
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:16,150
Please come to the middle.

1071
00:40:16,157 --> 00:40:17,990
(The winners can exchange
their pouches.)

1072
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:20,260
Before the exchange, I will reveal
what everyone has.

1073
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:24,530
There are five Gold Pouches...

1074
00:40:24,598 --> 00:40:26,200
and three Stone Pouches.

1075
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:32,770
(Stepping on Kwang Soo's foot
results in one more Gold Pouch.)

1076
00:40:32,773 --> 00:40:35,000
Seok Jin did his mission.

1077
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:36,440
(It may not be Seok Jin,)

1078
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:38,140
(but it must be the work
of another Hands of Stone.)

1079
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,440
Please open your pouches...

1080
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,840
- and check.
- Let's check.

1081
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:43,150
Seok Jin didn't touch me.

1082
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:45,050
The contents must have changed.

1083
00:40:46,053 --> 00:40:47,950
- Jong Kook has Gold Pouch.
- Let's see.

1084
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:52,160
(He had Stone Pouch.)

1085
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:56,830
(He now has Gold Pouch.)

1086
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:02,170
(The two Hands of Stone did
a mission on me.)

1087
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:08,500
(So Min showed a lot of interest.
Is she one of the Hands of Stone?)

1088
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:09,810
So Min.

1089
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,110
This mission is for you.

1090
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:15,440
(Seok Jin massaged everyone.)

1091
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:18,580
(Is he one of the Hands of Stone?)

1092
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:22,650
If a Hands of Stone does a mission,

1093
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:24,490
does stone change into gold?

1094
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,290
For stone to change into gold,

1095
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:28,420
two Hands of Stone
must do a mission.

1096
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:30,000
- They must do it on one person.
- I see.

1097
00:41:31,265 --> 00:41:33,930
(Who is the other Hands of Stone...)

1098
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:36,530
(who did a mission on Kwang Soo?)

1099
00:41:36,537 --> 00:41:38,100
Either Ji Hyo or Se Chan
has a chance...

1100
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,440
to change the pouch.

1101
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:42,910
Play if you don't want to lose,
rock-paper-scissors

1102
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,810
- Darn it.
- Okay. Okay.

1103
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,980
- It's a good opportunity.
- He wants to change his pouch.

1104
00:41:47,114 --> 00:41:49,950
Is there a point in knowing
if someone has stone or gold?

1105
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:52,520
That's the point of the race.

1106
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:54,050
Seok Jin.

1107
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:56,050
Stop talking nonsense.

1108
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,490
That's the point of the race.

1109
00:41:57,658 --> 00:42:00,160
Is there a way I can change
my stone to gold?

1110
00:42:00,294 --> 00:42:02,330
You should try to change it.

1111
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,930
You should touch your own shoulder.

1112
00:42:05,633 --> 00:42:07,230
(Why don't you do the mission
on yourself, Hands of Stone?)

1113
00:42:07,234 --> 00:42:08,770
That's a good idea.

1114
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,600
Do it twice.

1115
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,400
That's a good idea.

1116
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:15,670
Can Hands of Stone
do a mission on himself?

1117
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,170
- Is it possible?
- He can't do it on himself.

1118
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:19,080
The two Hands of Stone
have different missions.

1119
00:42:20,014 --> 00:42:21,510
The two Hands of Stone
have different missions.

1120
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:24,780
(The other one's mission isn't
stepping on feet.)

1121
00:42:24,785 --> 00:42:26,850
- I will exchange my pouch.
- With whom?

1122
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:28,120
I will exchange it
with So Min's pouch.

1123
00:42:29,156 --> 00:42:31,620
If you want to do what's right
for the team,

1124
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,320
don't be so sure
that I am the Hands of Stone.

1125
00:42:33,327 --> 00:42:34,520
- Seriously.
- Seok Jin.

1126
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:35,760
(Se Chan had a Stone Pouch.)

1127
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:39,530
(Is his exchange a success?)

1128
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,700
(Gold)

1129
00:42:44,238 --> 00:42:50,080
(As a result, So Min gets stone.)

1130
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:53,110
We will now move
to the next location.

1131
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:55,350
(They ride a bus
to go and have a meal.)

1132
00:42:55,983 --> 00:42:57,110
I need your care.

1133
00:42:57,117 --> 00:42:58,280
Do we have water?

1134
00:42:58,385 --> 00:42:59,620
Please give me water.

1135
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:03,890
(Drinking)

1136
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:06,890
(Do you want some?)

1137
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:08,630
I need some more.

1138
00:43:10,698 --> 00:43:12,360
Seok Jin gave me water...

1139
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:14,530
- for the first time ever.
- Is it a mission?

1140
00:43:14,835 --> 00:43:16,300
Is it a mission?

1141
00:43:16,537 --> 00:43:18,440
- He gave me water earlier.
- Really?

1142
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,970
He never gave me water before.

1143
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:22,310
I took the water bottle from him
and drank.

1144
00:43:22,343 --> 00:43:23,880
Now that I think about it...

1145
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,610
- He never does that.
- When I drink water, he goes,

1146
00:43:26,614 --> 00:43:28,840
- "Let me have some."
- That's right.

1147
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:30,950
He gave me water earlier
for the first time ever.

1148
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:32,480
- Seok Jin is the Hands of Stone.
- Seok Jin.

1149
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:34,280
- It's not me.
- Come clean already.

1150
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:36,120
This happened the last time, too.

1151
00:43:36,123 --> 00:43:37,890
You didn't believe me
no matter what I said.

1152
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:39,730
This is driving me crazy.

1153
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:41,960
(S Korean course restaurant,
Gwangju)

1154
00:43:41,962 --> 00:43:44,060
- It's a Korean course restaurant.
- Gwangju is well-known for it.

1155
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:45,400
This is incredible.

1156
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,730
- 1, 2, 3...
- This is a Korean course.

1157
00:43:47,735 --> 00:43:48,870
What is this?

1158
00:43:49,603 --> 00:43:51,130
It smells delicious.

1159
00:43:51,138 --> 00:43:52,300
(Delicious dishes fill the table.)

1160
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,170
The samhap looks delicious.

1161
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,310
(These are the tasty dishes
in the style of Jeolla Province.)

1162
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,510
- My goodness.
- Look at this meal.

1163
00:43:57,544 --> 00:43:59,350
- This is incredible.
- This is no joke.

1164
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:01,280
Do you want some water?

1165
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,280
Give me some water.

1166
00:44:02,283 --> 00:44:03,580
This is driving me crazy.

1167
00:44:03,784 --> 00:44:05,050
Does he need to do it
in front of the camera?

1168
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,220
What are you doing?

1169
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,280
(She gets her foot stepped on.)

1170
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:09,920
I don't know what she is doing.

1171
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:11,220
For goodness' sake.

1172
00:44:11,292 --> 00:44:12,290
She got her foot stepped on.

1173
00:44:12,293 --> 00:44:14,160
(So Min makes Jae Seok
do a mission on her.)

1174
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:15,330
For goodness' sake.

1175
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:16,930
(Is So Min the second
Hands of Stone?)

1176
00:44:16,931 --> 00:44:19,230
We will have a mission
with a meal on the line.

1177
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:20,600
Before that,

1178
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,470
we will tell you what's inside
everyone's pouches.

1179
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:24,470
It will give us some clues.

1180
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:25,900
Inside the pouches are...

1181
00:44:25,906 --> 00:44:28,370
(I wonder if the other
Hands of Stone did a mission.)

1182
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,110
Inside the pouches are...

1183
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:32,510
4 golds and 4 stones.

1184
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:33,910
It's the same as before.

1185
00:44:34,448 --> 00:44:35,980
(That means...)

1186
00:44:35,983 --> 00:44:37,520
We're back to square one.

1187
00:44:38,085 --> 00:44:39,110
It's the same.

1188
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,280
(Is it Seok Jin
with his massage and water?)

1189
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:43,150
(Is it So Min
who got her foot stepped on?)

1190
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:46,390
(Is one of them the other
Hands of Stone?)

1191
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,320
I will explain the mission.

1192
00:44:48,329 --> 00:44:51,360
We prepared a course with 30 dishes.

1193
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:52,590
30 dishes?

1194
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,230
The result of the mission
will decide...

1195
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,100
the number of the dishes.

1196
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:57,200
The name of the mission is...

1197
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,300
Food Stone Flicking.

1198
00:44:59,673 --> 00:45:01,740
(A mission to win side dishes,
Food Stone Flicking)

1199
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:02,770
- "Food Stone Flicking"?
- "Food Stone Flicking"?

1200
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:04,570
- "Food Stone Flicking"?
- "Stone Flicking"?

1201
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:05,610
(Is it similar to Stone Flicking?)

1202
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:08,680
It's a 4-on-4 team match.
We have put 30 stickers...

1203
00:45:08,682 --> 00:45:11,780
of the side dishes on the stones
on the ends of the table.

1204
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:13,220
(They will receive 30 stones
with names of side dishes.)

1205
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,380
Each team will have
a strategy meeting...

1206
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:17,820
and place the stones
however they want.

1207
00:45:17,825 --> 00:45:19,760
Each teammate will take
a turn to flick the stones.

1208
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,630
- You must remove 20 stones to win.
- Okay.

1209
00:45:23,364 --> 00:45:25,860
You can only have a meal with the
side dishes of the remaining stones.

1210
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:27,900
The team with more side dishes
will win.

1211
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:29,500
How will we split the teams?

1212
00:45:29,503 --> 00:45:30,500
(Let's break into teams.)

1213
00:45:30,504 --> 00:45:32,140
Jong Kook!

1214
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:34,740
Hey, don't come near me.
Don't get close to me.

1215
00:45:35,576 --> 00:45:38,510
(I know you have a big heart.
Be on my team.)

1216
00:45:38,812 --> 00:45:39,940
Should we split the teams like this?

1217
00:45:39,947 --> 00:45:41,510
(Se Chan, Haha, Seok Jin,
and Ji Hyo make a team.)

1218
00:45:41,515 --> 00:45:42,780
- Like this?
- Let's go with this team.

1219
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,110
- I like this.
- Hold on.

1220
00:45:44,118 --> 00:45:46,480
- We will continue with these teams.
- Okay!

1221
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:47,550
(Team Pink versus Team Blue)

1222
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:49,520
Goodness, "pickled radish".

1223
00:45:49,523 --> 00:45:50,790
(Placement of stones is the key.)

1224
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,490
- Goodness.
- We have to eat this.

1225
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:55,820
Let's place really good dishes
in the center.

1226
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:56,930
- Yes, yes.
- Should we put them in the back?

1227
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,600
- First off, let's get them out.
- Put them where they'll be safe.

1228
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,170
- Why don't we put this in front?
- Let's put bad dishes in front.

1229
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,500
- Dishes like these...
- "Soy sauce". "Chojang".

1230
00:46:03,504 --> 00:46:04,530
Wasabi too.

1231
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:05,700
Does anyone want fermented skate?

1232
00:46:05,739 --> 00:46:07,670
- Put that in front. Do you want it?
- I can't eat skate.

1233
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:09,140
- We are not desperate for it.
- Hold on a second.

1234
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:10,770
- We should place this here.
- That one.

1235
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:12,180
Anchovy jeon.

1236
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:14,910
- They don't want the skate.
- Really?

1237
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:16,980
- I can't eat skate.
- Only some people can eat it.

1238
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,950
(They are done
placing their stones.)

1239
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,980
- Team Blue can go first.
- Try it.

1240
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:22,320
I must get rid of one first.

1241
00:46:22,556 --> 00:46:23,860
Take the wasabi.

1242
00:46:25,426 --> 00:46:28,460
(What is Jae Seok's plan?)

1243
00:46:29,096 --> 00:46:30,860
(Pickled radish)

1244
00:46:30,864 --> 00:46:35,630
(He will break Team Pink's defense
with a dish they don't want.)

1245
00:46:35,636 --> 00:46:36,630
(Falling)

1246
00:46:36,637 --> 00:46:38,030
- There you go.
- Okay.

1247
00:46:38,038 --> 00:46:39,740
(He removes the stone for wasabi.)

1248
00:46:40,174 --> 00:46:41,240
Flip it.

1249
00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:43,940
(He successfully penetrates
into Team Pink's camp.)

1250
00:46:43,944 --> 00:46:45,070
It was wasabi.

1251
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:47,250
- Should I go next?
- Yes.

1252
00:46:47,714 --> 00:46:48,880
(Seok Jin goes next.)

1253
00:46:48,882 --> 00:46:50,110
- This one...
- Radish water kimchi.

1254
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:52,350
- If both fall, it'd be great.
- They might fall together.

1255
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,650
Okay.

1256
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:56,290
(Seok Jin is aiming at radish
water kimchi. What is his plan?)

1257
00:46:56,824 --> 00:46:57,920
(Radish water kimchi)

1258
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:00,660
(He must control his power to remove
the stone for radish water kimchi.)

1259
00:47:02,463 --> 00:47:03,560
Okay!

1260
00:47:03,564 --> 00:47:05,760
(He eliminates both his team's stone
and Team Blue's stone.)

1261
00:47:06,133 --> 00:47:07,200
Are you all right?

1262
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,400
- I did it gently. I had no choice.
- Okay.

1263
00:47:09,403 --> 00:47:10,400
(Both stones are out.)

1264
00:47:10,404 --> 00:47:12,640
- I could have made that work.
- Who's next?

1265
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:15,040
- Should I go next?
- Let me go next.

1266
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:18,310
Hey, go for chojang and salad.
No, go for the anchovy jeon.

1267
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:19,710
We can't play offense then.

1268
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:20,910
(We'll break your defense.)

1269
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:22,010
Target the one in front.

1270
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:24,510
(She's nervous
as Jong Kook is up next.)

1271
00:47:24,518 --> 00:47:26,120
Hold on a second.

1272
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,050
Okay. Let's go with that.
Wait, should we use that instead?

1273
00:47:28,055 --> 00:47:31,190
(Can Jong Kook break their defense?)

1274
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:32,750
Okay!

1275
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:34,490
(He gets rid of the salad
and penetrates into their camp.)

1276
00:47:34,495 --> 00:47:35,760
- Great job, Jong Kook. Great!
- Gosh, that.

1277
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:37,530
- That was a hard one.
- That was so cool.

1278
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:38,860
Great, great. That was nice.

1279
00:47:38,866 --> 00:47:40,930
- That was a good one.
- Yes, it was great.

1280
00:47:41,468 --> 00:47:42,630
Things are going great for me today.

1281
00:47:42,636 --> 00:47:44,870
Since our stone penetrated,
we can use that to end the game.

1282
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:46,270
- That will be difficult.
- Gosh, how cool.

1283
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,870
I don't think we can eliminate that.

1284
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,070
Should I use this to
get into their side?

1285
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:52,480
- Yes, yes.
- Hold on, if we flick this stone...

1286
00:47:52,513 --> 00:47:55,010
But they won't be able to hit this.
It's harder than it looks.

1287
00:47:55,449 --> 00:47:57,180
- Or should we...
- If that goes into their side...

1288
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,620
Hey, you should flick the stone
for cabbage wraps.

1289
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:01,350
Haha, we should play
this game like this.

1290
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:03,460
Since our stone is in their side,
we can use it to finish this.

1291
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:07,420
(Team Pink decides to penetrate
into Team Blue's side.)

1292
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:08,520
This game is over.

1293
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:10,500
(Try to penetrate if you can.)

1294
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:13,730
(Will Se Chan's attack
be successful?)

1295
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:16,230
(Flicking)

1296
00:48:16,236 --> 00:48:17,870
- Gosh.
- That wasn't bad.

1297
00:48:18,605 --> 00:48:20,140
- Okay. Good job.
- That wasn't bad.

1298
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,440
They can't touch that.

1299
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,440
- Of course, we can get rid of it.
- How? With which one?

1300
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:24,440
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

1301
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,510
- Use the chili pepper.
- Wait.

1302
00:48:25,512 --> 00:48:26,680
- What if I use that one?
- Chili pepper.

1303
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,840
- Should I use that to remove that?
- If you use that,

1304
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:30,510
it'd be terrible.
We have to discard cabbage wrap.

1305
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:32,520
- Remove lettuce and cabbage wrap.
- Yes, use chili pepper for that.

1306
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:35,690
Use chili pepper to get rid of them.
Hit the stone hard.

1307
00:48:36,056 --> 00:48:37,360
I don't think I can pull it off.

1308
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:38,990
No, no. You can do it.
Just hit it hard.

1309
00:48:39,393 --> 00:48:40,790
Make sure the stone goes inside.

1310
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,160
Make sure it goes
inside just slightly.

1311
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:46,230
(My gosh, Jong Kook.
Let me flick this stone.)

1312
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:49,030
- Don't let it fall off the table.
- Right.

1313
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:50,400
- There!
- Yes!

1314
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:51,970
(The cabbage wrap is out.)

1315
00:48:52,172 --> 00:48:53,810
You did it. This counts, right?

1316
00:48:53,874 --> 00:48:55,270
- Well done.
- Gosh, Jong Kook.

1317
00:48:55,275 --> 00:48:56,810
We can't let their stones stay
in our side.

1318
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:58,880
- Okay, okay.
- This counts, right?

1319
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:00,310
I'm going next.

1320
00:49:00,314 --> 00:49:03,280
(Kwang Soo gets rid
of Team Pink's stone in their side.)

1321
00:49:03,283 --> 00:49:06,050
- You did well.
- They won't get to eat a lot.

1322
00:49:06,153 --> 00:49:07,150
Okay. Good luck.

1323
00:49:07,154 --> 00:49:08,980
(Haha of Team Pink tries next.)

1324
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,650
- My gosh! Okay! 2 stones.
- 2 stones.

1325
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:12,890
(He removes two stones,
doenjang and kimchi, at once.)

1326
00:49:12,893 --> 00:49:14,260
- 2 stones at once!
- 2 stones.

1327
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:17,760
(He discards salted anchovy
to remove doenjang and kimchi.)

1328
00:49:17,764 --> 00:49:19,700
- Move aside. Step aside.
- Move aside.

1329
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,270
I'll use chojang.

1330
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:23,370
- If only there was a bigger space.
- Don't push it.

1331
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,800
- Don't push the stone.
- Flicking it that way is better.

1332
00:49:25,806 --> 00:49:27,400
- But it won't go far though.
- Let me...

1333
00:49:27,407 --> 00:49:29,570
- Haha did the same thing though.
- Yes, Haha did it.

1334
00:49:29,576 --> 00:49:31,340
- You can't do that.
- You can't push the stone.

1335
00:49:31,345 --> 00:49:32,640
- Flick only your stone.
- Don't use that one.

1336
00:49:32,713 --> 00:49:33,710
(He's nagging profusely.)

1337
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:35,340
- You touched it.
- Don't touch the other stones.

1338
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:37,380
- Go for those.
- Exactly. I'll get rid of two.

1339
00:49:37,384 --> 00:49:42,290
(He goes for the frontal attack
despite Jong Kook's disapproval.)

1340
00:49:42,823 --> 00:49:46,990
(With this one move,
I'll bring ruins to you.)

1341
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:50,500
Okay!

1342
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:52,230
(What? Did he lose his stone too?)

1343
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:53,930
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1344
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:57,530
(He wasted such a good chance.)

1345
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:59,030
(It was so hard to put the stone
in their side.)

1346
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,740
- That's all right.
- We don't need to eat that dish.

1347
00:50:01,742 --> 00:50:03,340
- That's okay.
- We only lost chojang.

1348
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,980
- Chojang? Okay.
- Who's up next?

1349
00:50:05,078 --> 00:50:06,580
It's Haha. Wait, no.
It's you, Seok Jin.

1350
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:08,650
What should we do? Should we use
this to finish the game?

1351
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:10,780
Jong Kook is powerful.

1352
00:50:10,784 --> 00:50:11,780
Aim at the center to be safe.

1353
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:13,450
Should I finish the game?
Or should I use this side dish?

1354
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:16,050
- Let's try to finish it.
- Yes, go for it.

1355
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:17,650
Hey, aim at the center to be safe.

1356
00:50:17,658 --> 00:50:19,290
- Aim at chojang and chili pepper.
- We won't have anything to eat.

1357
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:22,660
(He plans to end it while trying
to remove several side dishes.)

1358
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:25,960
(Jong Kook can drive the stone...)

1359
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:31,470
(into the opponent's side and
is good at nagging their teammates.)

1360
00:50:32,139 --> 00:50:33,970
(What kind of move will he show?)

1361
00:50:33,974 --> 00:50:35,040
- No!
- Yes!

1362
00:50:35,042 --> 00:50:37,740
(What just happened?
It just slides off the table.)

1363
00:50:38,645 --> 00:50:41,510
(He said he was going to finish it,
but he makes a colossal mistake.)

1364
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:44,850
(How fun! I enjoyed
watching your attempt to end it.)

1365
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,550
(What just happened?
They are flustered.)

1366
00:50:47,554 --> 00:50:48,880
That was a strong flick.

1367
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:50,690
- Is he on our team?
- Hey, this is...

1368
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:52,750
Okay, okay. Let me do this. Wait.

1369
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:55,360
But the upside is that
we have important side dishes.

1370
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:57,190
(The important side dishes
are safe.)

1371
00:50:57,197 --> 00:50:58,430
Hold on.

1372
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:00,630
- Who's up?
- Me.

1373
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:01,730
Seok Jin.

1374
00:51:01,735 --> 00:51:04,170
Hey, just mess up
the cluster of side dishes.

1375
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:07,610
(Okay. I got it.)

1376
00:51:08,308 --> 00:51:09,540
I bet he feels a lot of pressure.

1377
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,580
(No, we can't go down like this.)

1378
00:51:12,245 --> 00:51:14,510
(Seok Jin is determined to
mess up the cluster...)

1379
00:51:14,514 --> 00:51:19,280
(and manages to destroy the zone
for the important side dishes.)

1380
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:20,550
(Amazing!
What's gotten into you, Seok Jin?)

1381
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:22,720
- Yes!
- Yes, Seok Jin!

1382
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:27,130
(No way. This can't be
really happening.)

1383
00:51:27,427 --> 00:51:35,800
(They clustered their important side
dishes to avoid getting eliminated.)

1384
00:51:36,536 --> 00:51:39,300
(A flick from Seok Jin kicks
them off the table.)

1385
00:51:39,306 --> 00:51:40,970
I'm sorry,
but didn't he just push the stone?

1386
00:51:43,176 --> 00:51:46,070
Give me one more chance.
Let me redeem myself.

1387
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,550
(I can't let this fly.)

1388
00:51:49,783 --> 00:51:51,680
- Jong Kook, just finish this game.
- Okay, go for it.

1389
00:51:51,985 --> 00:51:53,950
(Shake off your mistake,
and show them what you've got!)

1390
00:51:54,388 --> 00:51:55,950
Just don't get rid
of the potato dish.

1391
00:51:56,523 --> 00:52:02,990
(The fate of Team Blue depends
on Jong Kook's fingertip.)

1392
00:52:11,538 --> 00:52:12,739
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1393
00:52:12,739 --> 00:52:14,641
(What? It just flew by.)

1394
00:52:15,509 --> 00:52:17,878
(Redeem himself? He ends up
losing their stone again.)

1395
00:52:17,878 --> 00:52:19,579
Why did the stone go that way?

1396
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:22,649
- That was so funny.
- It was hilarious!

1397
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:23,850
This is crazy!

1398
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,355
Why did it go that way?

1399
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:29,823
Is it because of the gloves?

1400
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,691
- I can't believe it, Jong Kook.
- He's on our team!

1401
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:32,759
Is it the gloves?

1402
00:52:32,759 --> 00:52:34,694
- Why does it keep going that way?
- The funny thing is that...

1403
00:52:35,328 --> 00:52:37,497
we all know that Jong Kook
messed up,

1404
00:52:37,497 --> 00:52:38,965
- but we can't say anything.
- No, no.

1405
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:42,035
(They keep their silence.)

1406
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:44,037
Now that I look at them
as a third party,

1407
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:45,305
I understand how I might've looked.

1408
00:52:45,739 --> 00:52:47,274
I feel so proud of myself.

1409
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,010
Gosh, I should...
I must take off my gloves.

1410
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,111
Gosh, this...

1411
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:52,712
If you lose four more stones,
the game will be over.

1412
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,714
- It's over if you lose four more.
- Hey, what we should do is...

1413
00:52:54,714 --> 00:52:57,617
- We should hit this part.
- I see. Okay.

1414
00:52:58,018 --> 00:52:59,920
(Haha of Team Pink goes next.)

1415
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,987
- Here I go.
- Okay.

1416
00:53:01,288 --> 00:53:04,024
(He will focus on attacking the zone
of important side dishes.)

1417
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:05,826
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

1418
00:53:05,826 --> 00:53:07,327
I hit it really hard though.

1419
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:09,696
(Haha, end this game!)

1420
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,367
Okay!

1421
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,236
(Sliding off)

1422
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:18,238
- 4 stones dropped.
- 4 stones!

1423
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,606
(Exactly 4 stones are eliminated.)

1424
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,644
(Team Pink takes the win!)

1425
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,413
What's up with the direction?

1426
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:28,281
How could it go that way?

1427
00:53:28,281 --> 00:53:29,916
(He misses again.)

1428
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:32,886
- I picked the wrong team.
- We had help from him.

1429
00:53:32,886 --> 00:53:34,921
We were so close. Seriously.

1430
00:53:34,955 --> 00:53:36,389
- What a bummer.
- Our team...

1431
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:38,425
- My favorite dishes remain.
- Only the winning team can eat.

1432
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,160
- Yes!
- The losing team will eat...

1433
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,428
(They'll have rice and dried laver.)

1434
00:53:41,628 --> 00:53:42,696
(Side dishes they protected)

1435
00:53:42,696 --> 00:53:44,798
We managed to protect tteok galbi.
We did it.

1436
00:53:44,798 --> 00:53:46,266
Gosh, we have so many side dishes.

1437
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,468
I understand the saying,
"the table legs might break."

1438
00:53:48,535 --> 00:53:50,570
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1439
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,571
(Feeling proud)

1440
00:53:51,571 --> 00:53:53,907
(Looking pitiful)

1441
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:57,010
The dried laver is good.
It must be from the south.

1442
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,279
(I'm glad the dried laver is tasty.
It must be from the south.)

1443
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:00,447
It's delicious.

1444
00:54:00,547 --> 00:54:01,615
Gosh, give me tteok galbi.

1445
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,383
(Team Pink is feasting
on tteok galbi.)

1446
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:04,985
The tteok galbi is really juicy.

1447
00:54:04,985 --> 00:54:06,887
(This tteok galbi is the juiciest!)

1448
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:11,091
(This tteok galbi is the best
in the world!)

1449
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:12,425
It's really juicy.

1450
00:54:12,993 --> 00:54:14,694
(Amazed)

1451
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:15,695
It tastes so good.

1452
00:54:15,695 --> 00:54:17,531
Please let me have a taste.

1453
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:18,632
(Desperate)

1454
00:54:18,632 --> 00:54:20,901
I'll stop suspecting you, Seok Jin.

1455
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:22,802
Even if you massage my shoulders,
I'll pretend I have no idea.

1456
00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:24,838
- What?
- Please.

1457
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:26,139
(Ignoring)

1458
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:29,075
Try tteok galbi with chili peppers.
It tastes amazing.

1459
00:54:29,376 --> 00:54:31,945
(Jae Seok steals fried eel.)

1460
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:33,680
It tastes different.

1461
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:38,151
(Let me have a taste.)

1462
00:54:38,151 --> 00:54:40,186
Jae Seok.

1463
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,454
Why are you eating it?

1464
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:43,557
- What?
- Why are you eating it?

1465
00:54:44,124 --> 00:54:46,259
(Kwang Soo attempts to
retrieve the fried eel.)

1466
00:54:46,259 --> 00:54:47,327
When did he take it?

1467
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:48,862
(Choking)

1468
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:51,665
(Kwang Soo retrieves fried eel...)

1469
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:52,799
(and wraps it with dried seaweed.)

1470
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:53,934
Look at that.

1471
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:55,302
What?

1472
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,004
Look at him.

1473
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,539
(I give up.)

1474
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:02,742
I thought you were pulling out
my uvula.

1475
00:55:02,742 --> 00:55:04,544
(Kwang Soo...)

1476
00:55:04,544 --> 00:55:06,613
- Jae Seok.
- How does it taste?

1477
00:55:07,147 --> 00:55:08,915
It tastes amazing. It's crispy.

1478
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:10,784
Is it crispy
even after Jae Seok chewed it?

1479
00:55:10,784 --> 00:55:12,586
Yes. It's still crispy.

1480
00:55:12,586 --> 00:55:16,156
Who has the biggest eyes?

1481
00:55:16,156 --> 00:55:17,490
- Me.
- Why?

1482
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:19,593
I'm giving this to the one
with the biggest eyes.

1483
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:20,860
- It's me.
- It's me.

1484
00:55:21,628 --> 00:55:22,629
Seok Jin.

1485
00:55:22,629 --> 00:55:23,697
(I have bigger eyes.)

1486
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:24,831
Mine are huge.

1487
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:25,966
(They show off
the white of their eyes.)

1488
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:27,067
- Look at my eyes.
- My eyes are bigger.

1489
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,134
Look at me.

1490
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:30,203
- Look at my eyes.
- My eyes are actually big.

1491
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:31,972
- Look at my eyes.
- Look at me.

1492
00:55:31,972 --> 00:55:33,840
(Wide open)

1493
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,076
- Come here.
- What about me?

1494
00:55:36,076 --> 00:55:38,011
- My eyes are bigger.
- Kwang Soo's were bigger.

1495
00:55:38,178 --> 00:55:39,713
I'm sorry. Kwang Soo's eyes were
the biggest.

1496
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:42,482
The funny thing is that
Jong Kook isn't doing anything.

1497
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:43,683
I have no chance.

1498
00:55:43,683 --> 00:55:44,718
(I can't do anything
with these eyes.)

1499
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:46,219
There's no point.

1500
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:49,756
Guys, I like big nostrils.

1501
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:51,691
(Let me try.)

1502
00:55:51,758 --> 00:55:52,759
Me.

1503
00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:53,927
(My nostrils are big.)

1504
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:54,995
Let me see.

1505
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:56,997
- Let me see.
- Look.

1506
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,832
- Mine are big.
- Let me see.

1507
00:55:59,432 --> 00:56:00,433
Look at me.

1508
00:56:00,433 --> 00:56:03,003
(Why are her nostrils so big?)

1509
00:56:04,204 --> 00:56:06,473
(So Min uses dried laver.)

1510
00:56:06,473 --> 00:56:09,275
- What are you doing?
- So Min, come here.

1511
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:11,077
Good job.

1512
00:56:12,045 --> 00:56:13,680
This is so annoying.

1513
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,948
(Let me have some food.)

1514
00:56:14,948 --> 00:56:16,316
- It tastes so good.
- This is annoying.

1515
00:56:16,316 --> 00:56:18,151
If you have thick eyebrows,
come to me.

1516
00:56:18,151 --> 00:56:19,719
(If you have thick eyebrows,
come to me.)

1517
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,054
Mine are thick.

1518
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:22,722
If you...

1519
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:23,823
Okay.

1520
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:25,925
Look.

1521
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:28,995
(What do you think of my eyebrows?)

1522
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,430
Who has...

1523
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:31,965
- thick eyebrows?
- Me.

1524
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:36,202
(He drops dried laver.)

1525
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,270
Excuse me.

1526
00:56:37,303 --> 00:56:38,304
What are you doing?

1527
00:56:38,304 --> 00:56:40,874
(He wraps fried eel
with dried laver.)

1528
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:42,075
I dropped it.

1529
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:43,977
- It's my dried laver.
- It's just dried laver, right?

1530
00:56:43,977 --> 00:56:45,445
It's really...

1531
00:56:47,047 --> 00:56:48,548
Why are you eating it?

1532
00:56:48,548 --> 00:56:50,016
(I saw it.)

1533
00:56:50,016 --> 00:56:51,317
- What?
- Why are you eating eel?

1534
00:56:51,317 --> 00:56:52,886
- Why are you eating it?
- Eel...

1535
00:56:53,153 --> 00:56:57,157
(Kwang Soo attempts to
retrieve the eel again.)

1536
00:56:57,724 --> 00:56:59,092
(Jae Seok bites
Kwang Soo's fingers.)

1537
00:56:59,092 --> 00:57:01,061
(Screaming)

1538
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:03,630
It's here.

1539
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,432
(Is Kwang Soo giving up?)

1540
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:06,433
So Min, take it out.

1541
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:08,401
(He asks for help.)

1542
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:11,071
- Take it out.
- Push his belly.

1543
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:13,106
That's it.

1544
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:14,574
Take it.

1545
00:57:14,574 --> 00:57:17,243
- Let's give them more.
- That's his tongue.

1546
00:57:17,444 --> 00:57:18,445
(The eel is intercepted.)

1547
00:57:18,445 --> 00:57:19,512
Hey.

1548
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:24,818
(Eel tastes great with dried laver.)

1549
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:28,154
(Give me my eel!)

1550
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,258
Why were you eating eel?

1551
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:35,695
I thought I was doing
an endoscopy on Jae Seok.

1552
00:57:35,695 --> 00:57:37,464
I felt something soft.

1553
00:57:37,564 --> 00:57:38,865
I thought you were pulling out
my tongue.

1554
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:41,701
You might starve to death.

1555
00:57:41,701 --> 00:57:45,338
(You might starve to death,
Jong Kook.)

1556
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:46,606
You shouldn't stay like that.

1557
00:57:46,606 --> 00:57:48,675
- I'm sorry.
- That's not how you do it.

1558
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:50,744
- We don't do it like that.
- I was just being realistic.

1559
00:57:50,744 --> 00:57:52,645
What was I supposed to do?

1560
00:57:52,645 --> 00:57:56,382
I'm passing this fried eel over...

1561
00:57:56,382 --> 00:57:58,218
to Jong Kook.

1562
00:57:58,885 --> 00:58:00,086
Pass it to Jong Kook.

1563
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:01,721
(Please pass it to Jong Kook.)

1564
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:04,157
Here. Pass it to Jong Kook.

1565
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:07,594
Why don't you give it to him
directly?

1566
00:58:08,428 --> 00:58:10,196
I'm giving it to Jong Kook.

1567
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,766
Let's just take a little.

1568
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:15,735
He didn't say how much of it
we should pass onto him.

1569
00:58:15,735 --> 00:58:16,936
(Let's take a little bit.)

1570
00:58:16,936 --> 00:58:18,571
Stop it.

1571
00:58:18,571 --> 00:58:20,073
Hold on. I'll take this.

1572
00:58:20,073 --> 00:58:22,442
(Whatever)

1573
00:58:23,276 --> 00:58:27,547
(The eel disappears.)

1574
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:29,015
What happened to my eel?

1575
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:32,152
- It's not here yet.
- There was an accident.

1576
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:35,054
Please pass this tteok galbi
to Jong Kook.

1577
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:36,856
(Please pass it onto Jong Kook.)

1578
00:58:36,856 --> 00:58:38,591
I ate some.

1579
00:58:39,259 --> 00:58:40,493
I just need this much.

1580
00:58:41,027 --> 00:58:42,862
(So Min takes everything.)

1581
00:58:43,696 --> 00:58:45,532
(I'm getting nothing again.)

1582
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:47,367
Gosh, you're...

1583
00:58:47,367 --> 00:58:50,436
(Kwang Soo retrieves tteok galbi.)

1584
00:58:50,436 --> 00:58:52,806
Are you crazy?

1585
00:58:54,107 --> 00:58:56,810
(How will tteok galbi taste
wrapped in dried laver?)

1586
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,447
I've eaten many different things,

1587
00:59:01,447 --> 00:59:03,216
but I don't know
their natural flavors.

1588
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:06,553
(Let's move on.)

1589
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,721
(Today's penalty is water bomb.)

1590
00:59:09,322 --> 00:59:11,291
It's war.

1591
00:59:11,524 --> 00:59:12,659
What's that?

1592
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,760
What's that?

1593
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,428
(They'll be throwing shoes.)

1594
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:16,763
(Barrel men)

1595
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,298
It's the barrel man game.

1596
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:21,568
This is your last chance to
avoid the water bomb.

1597
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:23,069
It's Lucky Man Quiz.

1598
00:59:23,069 --> 00:59:24,971
(Lucky Man Quiz)

1599
00:59:24,971 --> 00:59:26,206
Lucky Man?

1600
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:27,307
Lucky Man.

1601
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,843
If you know the answer
to the question,

1602
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:32,745
stick as many knives as you want
into the two barrels,

1603
00:59:32,745 --> 00:59:34,314
and say the answer.

1604
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,884
If someone sticks more knives
than the previous person does,

1605
00:59:38,051 --> 00:59:40,053
that person will have priority
to say the answer.

1606
00:59:40,053 --> 00:59:43,590
The one who sticks the most knives
gets the chance to say the answer.

1607
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:44,724
(That person has priority.)

1608
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:47,260
- It was hard last time.
- You have to stick many knives.

1609
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,862
We've done it before.

1610
00:59:49,429 --> 00:59:51,898
The rules are the same
except one thing.

1611
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:52,966
(There's a new rule.)

1612
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:56,970
Let's say one of the men popped up.

1613
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,138
If you cause the other man
to pop up too,

1614
00:59:59,172 --> 01:00:02,575
you'll lose twice as many knives
as you've stuck.

1615
01:00:02,575 --> 01:00:04,377
(If you cause the other man
to pop up too,)

1616
01:00:04,377 --> 01:00:07,180
(you'll lose twice as many knives
as you stuck.)

1617
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,848
- You'll lose them?
- Yes.

1618
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:10,950
You should be careful.

1619
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:15,054
(Who will win this game where you
have to be both bold and patient?)

1620
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:19,792
As it's 2018, each member will
get 18 knives.

1621
01:00:19,993 --> 01:00:23,296
By throwing your shoes,
you can get additional knives.

1622
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:24,297
(You can get additional knives.)

1623
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:26,299
Let me tell you the numbers of
Gold Pouches and Stone Pouches.

1624
01:00:26,299 --> 01:00:27,533
- Yes.
- Right.

1625
01:00:28,701 --> 01:00:29,969
At the moment...

1626
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:31,104
(The final update)

1627
01:00:31,104 --> 01:00:33,840
There are 2 Gold Pouches
and 6 Stone Pouches.

1628
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,742
(2 Gold Pouches and 6 Stone Pouches)

1629
01:00:35,742 --> 01:00:37,877
(The number of Gold Pouches
decreased by 2 on the way.)

1630
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:39,512
Six Stone Pouches?

1631
01:00:39,545 --> 01:00:40,980
There are six Stone Pouches?

1632
01:00:41,281 --> 01:00:42,815
- How many Stone Pouches?
- There are six.

1633
01:00:42,815 --> 01:00:44,817
(Jae Seok and
another Hands of Stone...)

1634
01:00:44,817 --> 01:00:46,686
(have started moving.)

1635
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,687
When did it happen?

1636
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:49,455
- I didn't do anything.
- It happened during lunch.

1637
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:51,424
- I didn't do anything.
- It must be the other team.

1638
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:53,026
- They were moving all the time.
- Right?

1639
01:00:53,026 --> 01:00:55,028
We were just trying to get food.

1640
01:00:55,028 --> 01:00:56,629
- Six Stone Pouches?
- It's the other team.

1641
01:00:56,629 --> 01:00:58,765
(It's time for two Hands of Stone
to work together.)

1642
01:00:58,765 --> 01:01:01,801
(Who is the other one?)

1643
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:06,639
You can win additional knives
in this game.

1644
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:08,074
Just do it like this.

1645
01:01:08,074 --> 01:01:09,375
- Right.
- There you go.

1646
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,944
You have 23 knives now.

1647
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:12,512
This side...

1648
01:01:13,179 --> 01:01:14,948
- Multiplied by two?
- Yes.

1649
01:01:14,948 --> 01:01:17,016
- Yes.
- I have the most knives.

1650
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:20,086
Do you have your knives?

1651
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:21,087
- Yes.
- Yes.

1652
01:01:21,087 --> 01:01:22,155
Here is...

1653
01:01:23,256 --> 01:01:24,324
the first question.

1654
01:01:25,858 --> 01:01:29,262
What is the name of the string...

1655
01:01:29,262 --> 01:01:33,599
attached to books such as the Bible?

1656
01:01:34,334 --> 01:01:36,769
One, bookmark string.

1657
01:01:37,337 --> 01:01:39,572
Two, middle string.

1658
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:42,342
Three, notice string.

1659
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,610
Four, dividing string.

1660
01:01:45,178 --> 01:01:47,013
It's hard.

1661
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:48,948
Me.

1662
01:01:49,382 --> 01:01:51,217
Say how many knives
you're going to bet.

1663
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:52,285
One.

1664
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:53,953
(If she sticks it successfully,
she gets the chance.)

1665
01:01:53,953 --> 01:01:55,621
Please stick it into the barrel.

1666
01:01:59,726 --> 01:02:00,927
(Sticking)

1667
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:02,528
(So Min succeeds.)

1668
01:02:02,528 --> 01:02:03,663
Me.

1669
01:02:03,997 --> 01:02:05,031
I'll bet five.

1670
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:06,566
(Kwang Soo never lets
So Min succeed.)

1671
01:02:06,566 --> 01:02:07,934
- Five?
- Yes.

1672
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:10,236
You get the chance
only if the man doesn't pop up.

1673
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,306
- Pop up.
- Pop up.

1674
01:02:13,573 --> 01:02:14,941
I'm sure it will.

1675
01:02:15,008 --> 01:02:16,175
Otherwise, it'd be weird.

1676
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:18,211
Right.

1677
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:20,246
Even more?

1678
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,948
(It's the last knife.)

1679
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:24,017
- It's there.
- If you stick so many...

1680
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:25,051
Okay.

1681
01:02:25,585 --> 01:02:26,719
It's not like you.

1682
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:27,720
(Kwang Soo gets the chance.)

1683
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,256
- I have no idea.
- I can't even try.

1684
01:02:30,256 --> 01:02:32,759
If no one wants to try,
Kwang Soo will get the chance.

1685
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:35,128
If he says the wrong answer,
So Min will get the chance.

1686
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:36,195
(If Kwang Soo is wrong,
So Min will get the chance.)

1687
01:02:36,262 --> 01:02:37,330
Okay. I'll say the right answer.

1688
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:38,798
- I'm sure.
- Kwang Soo.

1689
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,033
- I know the answer.
- I'll give you three seconds.

1690
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:42,402
Two, middle string.

1691
01:02:42,969 --> 01:02:44,737
Two, middle string.

1692
01:02:45,338 --> 01:02:46,739
- That's wrong.
- That sounded wrong.

1693
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:48,574
I don't think it's middle string.

1694
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:49,842
Is it?

1695
01:02:49,842 --> 01:02:52,045
(What's the name of the string?)

1696
01:02:52,045 --> 01:02:53,346
It's wrong. I knew it.

1697
01:02:53,346 --> 01:02:54,947
(Kwang Soo has to return 5 knives.)

1698
01:02:54,947 --> 01:02:56,482
So Min will get it right.

1699
01:02:56,783 --> 01:02:57,884
So Min.

1700
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,019
Three, notice string.

1701
01:03:01,254 --> 01:03:03,556
Three, notice string.

1702
01:03:03,556 --> 01:03:05,691
- Please.
- Okay.

1703
01:03:05,758 --> 01:03:07,593
There are two left.

1704
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:09,095
It's either 1 or 4 now.

1705
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:11,998
You have to bet your knives.
You have to bet at least six.

1706
01:03:13,466 --> 01:03:17,637
(Se Chan was born as huge fire.)

1707
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:19,839
I'll bet six.

1708
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:21,407
- Do it.
- Let me try.

1709
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,277
- I think he'll get it right.
- I bet six.

1710
01:03:24,277 --> 01:03:25,344
Six?

1711
01:03:25,344 --> 01:03:26,879
You can stick them
into the other barrel too.

1712
01:03:26,879 --> 01:03:28,314
- Can I?
- Yes.

1713
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:31,150
- Really?
- That's why we have two.

1714
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:33,886
- Really?
- You should have told us.

1715
01:03:33,886 --> 01:03:36,055
(Why did I stick all of them
into one barrel?)

1716
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:37,657
(Se Chan goes for the other barrel.)

1717
01:03:37,657 --> 01:03:38,791
One.

1718
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:45,498
(I even won Excellence Award.
It's time to get moving.)

1719
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,002
5 and 6. Okay.

1720
01:03:50,236 --> 01:03:52,839
The next person has to bet
at least seven.

1721
01:03:52,839 --> 01:03:54,373
The other barrel has
many empty slots.

1722
01:03:55,174 --> 01:03:56,242
I'll bet seven.

1723
01:03:56,776 --> 01:03:58,511
Then I have to bet eight.

1724
01:03:58,778 --> 01:04:00,947
(Seok Jin will finally
shake up the game.)

1725
01:04:00,947 --> 01:04:02,381
Was one bookmark string?

1726
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:04,283
(Confused)

1727
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:06,552
Was it?

1728
01:04:06,552 --> 01:04:08,054
(What was the question?)

1729
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,222
Was one bookmark string?

1730
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:11,491
He doesn't even remember
the choices.

1731
01:04:11,757 --> 01:04:13,092
Was number one bookmark string?

1732
01:04:13,092 --> 01:04:14,193
(He only memorizes number 1.)

1733
01:04:14,193 --> 01:04:15,394
- One is bookmark string.
- It's exactly...

1734
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:17,296
- Two.
- like this year's fortune.

1735
01:04:17,296 --> 01:04:18,698
He acts before thinking.

1736
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:20,333
Let's go.

1737
01:04:20,433 --> 01:04:21,634
Okay, one.

1738
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:23,436
- He's amazing.
- What?

1739
01:04:23,436 --> 01:04:24,804
(He makes a bet with 7 knives.)

1740
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:26,172
All right.

1741
01:04:26,339 --> 01:04:29,008
(He already stuck 6 knives.)

1742
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:30,243
Please.

1743
01:04:31,444 --> 01:04:32,945
- It won't pop.
- Okay.

1744
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:35,214
- Do I stick two more?
- Yes.

1745
01:04:35,414 --> 01:04:36,816
- I bet two more.
- Okay.

1746
01:04:36,816 --> 01:04:38,718
(Se Chan bets 2 more.)

1747
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:40,386
- Okay.
- Here we go.

1748
01:04:40,453 --> 01:04:41,721
Come on. Okay.

1749
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:43,356
(He successfully sticks in 2.)

1750
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:44,524
I hope it pops for him.

1751
01:04:44,524 --> 01:04:45,992
If it pops, you lose.

1752
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,426
This is incredible.

1753
01:04:47,927 --> 01:04:50,429
- It'll pop no matter what.
- Go on.

1754
01:04:50,696 --> 01:04:52,064
Will anyone invest two?

1755
01:04:52,064 --> 01:04:53,499
If I win, I'll give back four.

1756
01:04:53,799 --> 01:04:55,401
- I'll invest two.
- Okay.

1757
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:56,702
Seok Jin.

1758
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:58,671
- If I win, I'll give two more.
- Recite the choices.

1759
01:04:58,738 --> 01:05:00,106
What were the choices?

1760
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:02,441
1 was bookmark string,
4 was...

1761
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:06,512
- My answer is one anyway.
- Never mind.

1762
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:09,148
- How can you invest in him?
- Come on.

1763
01:05:09,148 --> 01:05:10,316
Make your investment now.

1764
01:05:10,316 --> 01:05:11,884
- Will you give 4?
- If I win, I'll give back 4.

1765
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:13,352
- Will you give 4?
- I'll give you 2 more.

1766
01:05:13,819 --> 01:05:17,523
If this were a stock investment,
she's investing in an unknown stock.

1767
01:05:18,824 --> 01:05:21,294
Please don't pop. Please don't.

1768
01:05:22,762 --> 01:05:24,197
There aren't many here.

1769
01:05:26,465 --> 01:05:28,000
Please pop.

1770
01:05:28,467 --> 01:05:29,535
Okay.

1771
01:05:29,969 --> 01:05:31,204
(Double my investment?)

1772
01:05:31,204 --> 01:05:33,039
They're lasting for so long.

1773
01:05:38,277 --> 01:05:41,180
(This is as far as
Seok Jin will go.)

1774
01:05:41,447 --> 01:05:44,317
(Her dream of doubling
her investment is destroyed.)

1775
01:05:44,317 --> 01:05:46,385
(He gets back his 9 knives.)

1776
01:05:46,385 --> 01:05:48,721
This year's fortune
proves to be right.

1777
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:49,755
(He's depressed.)

1778
01:05:49,755 --> 01:05:51,657
Don't take bold steps.

1779
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,593
Do things slowly.

1780
01:05:54,193 --> 01:05:56,028
(Se Chan gets the chance to answer.)

1781
01:05:56,028 --> 01:05:58,231
- My answer is one.
- That's right.

1782
01:05:58,297 --> 01:05:59,465
- What's the answer?
- Number one?

1783
01:05:59,465 --> 01:06:00,700
He should say the answer.

1784
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,301
My answer is one.

1785
01:06:02,435 --> 01:06:03,636
It's bookmark string.

1786
01:06:03,936 --> 01:06:05,071
One?

1787
01:06:05,238 --> 01:06:06,672
You're scaring me.

1788
01:06:06,806 --> 01:06:08,241
What did you say exactly?

1789
01:06:08,274 --> 01:06:09,542
One.

1790
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,444
It's bookmark...

1791
01:06:11,444 --> 01:06:13,112
It's what marks pages.

1792
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:16,015
- Could you repeat?
- Mark what?

1793
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:17,083
(What is he saying?)

1794
01:06:17,416 --> 01:06:18,684
What I mean is,

1795
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:19,885
the string marks pages.

1796
01:06:20,586 --> 01:06:23,356
Be more accurate. In 3, 2...

1797
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:25,191
I'll choose four instead.

1798
01:06:25,825 --> 01:06:27,760
Four, dividing string.

1799
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,095
(He changes his answer.)

1800
01:06:29,095 --> 01:06:30,463
(Incorrect)

1801
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:32,965
- Number one was correct.
- That was correct.

1802
01:06:32,965 --> 01:06:34,700
- Was that it?
- Isn't number one correct?

1803
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,669
- It's like a bookmark.
- The answer is bookmark string.

1804
01:06:36,669 --> 01:06:38,471
It's a string used as a bookmark.

1805
01:06:39,205 --> 01:06:40,806
(He returns his 8 knives.)

1806
01:06:40,806 --> 01:06:42,074
Bookmark?

1807
01:06:43,276 --> 01:06:46,112
(Se Chan and Seok Jin
shouldn't open a business together.)

1808
01:06:46,112 --> 01:06:49,882
(The two of them fail together.)

1809
01:06:49,949 --> 01:06:52,418
The next question is very easy.

1810
01:06:52,418 --> 01:06:54,053
- That's good.
- Everyone will make bets.

1811
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:55,154
We should.

1812
01:06:55,254 --> 01:06:56,555
Everyone will make bets.

1813
01:06:56,989 --> 01:06:58,758
Which animal does year 2018...

1814
01:06:58,758 --> 01:07:00,493
- represent?
- Jae Seok.

1815
01:07:00,626 --> 01:07:02,261
- So Min.
- Ji Hyo.

1816
01:07:03,296 --> 01:07:05,131
We didn't see the choices yet.

1817
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:07,199
There are only five choices.

1818
01:07:07,767 --> 01:07:09,135
I'll bet one for now.

1819
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:10,803
I'll bet three.

1820
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:15,174
(Jae Seok makes a bet of 1 knife.)

1821
01:07:16,008 --> 01:07:18,844
I know the answer.
We talked about it before.

1822
01:07:19,278 --> 01:07:22,715
Okay.
We'll be competing each other again.

1823
01:07:22,948 --> 01:07:24,283
- I bet five.
- Okay.

1824
01:07:24,617 --> 01:07:27,119
I knew Ji Hyo was competitive.

1825
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,055
I haven't played in a while.

1826
01:07:29,055 --> 01:07:33,759
(Lucky Ji Hyo makes a bet
after a long time.)

1827
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,761
Ji Hyo stuck five knives.

1828
01:07:35,795 --> 01:07:37,930
You must bet six
if you bet for the first time.

1829
01:07:37,997 --> 01:07:40,700
- Jae Seok must stick five more.
- Five more?

1830
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,135
Can you guess which answer it is?

1831
01:07:43,469 --> 01:07:44,804
Come on.

1832
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:47,173
We don't care because we're moths.

1833
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:48,507
We just go for it.

1834
01:07:48,507 --> 01:07:49,608
- Isn't it...
- We go for it.

1835
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,677
better to wait which answer remains?

1836
01:07:51,677 --> 01:07:53,446
No, we don't care.

1837
01:07:53,546 --> 01:07:55,648
(In that case...)

1838
01:07:55,648 --> 01:07:56,882
May I make a bet now?

1839
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:59,151
- You must bet seven knives.
- I will.

1840
01:08:00,986 --> 01:08:02,655
I don't want to play this round.

1841
01:08:02,855 --> 01:08:04,890
If it pops for Kwang Soo,
do I get the chance?

1842
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:06,826
I hope it pops for Kwang Soo.

1843
01:08:06,826 --> 01:08:07,993
(Kwang Soo bets 7 knives.)

1844
01:08:08,694 --> 01:08:10,429
Seven knives are a lot.

1845
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:12,698
- Please pop.
- Is he betting them all?

1846
01:08:13,399 --> 01:08:15,634
I must win no matter what.

1847
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:17,870
Which number do you think it is?

1848
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:19,905
Answers to the last 2 questions
were number 1.

1849
01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:20,973
It's number three.

1850
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:23,542
(He hopes that it will pop.)

1851
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:25,778
I'll get it right.

1852
01:08:25,778 --> 01:08:31,317
(The others watch
Kwang Soo's bold action.)

1853
01:08:31,317 --> 01:08:33,319
It'll pop this time.

1854
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,388
(Kwang Soo sticks 4 knives safely.)

1855
01:08:35,388 --> 01:08:36,822
This isn't like Kwang Soo.

1856
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:41,460
(He sticks in 5 knives safely.)

1857
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:43,796
- I have two left.
- Okay.

1858
01:08:44,130 --> 01:08:45,297
Kwang Soo.

1859
01:08:45,965 --> 01:08:47,533
This isn't like you.

1860
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:51,337
Okay.

1861
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:53,005
(He sticks in 6 knives
without a problem.)

1862
01:08:53,005 --> 01:08:54,140
(He's lucky in 2018.)

1863
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:57,243
Please pop. It has to pop.

1864
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:59,445
- It's the last spark.
- 5, 4...

1865
01:08:59,445 --> 01:09:01,046
It's not the last spark.

1866
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:05,584
(Although it's the last fortune
for him,)

1867
01:09:05,584 --> 01:09:10,423
(Kwang Soo does get lucky
after all.)

1868
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:12,258
- Two.
- This is it.

1869
01:09:12,258 --> 01:09:15,494
(Will he stick in 7 knives
successfully?)

1870
01:09:15,494 --> 01:09:16,629
Okay.

1871
01:09:16,629 --> 01:09:19,064
Jae Seok must stick in
two more knives.

1872
01:09:19,064 --> 01:09:20,166
- Two more?
- Yes.

1873
01:09:20,166 --> 01:09:21,901
- That's a total of 8.
- 2 will be worth it.

1874
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:23,335
It's worth playing.

1875
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:25,070
Okay.

1876
01:09:25,471 --> 01:09:26,772
Two is worth playing.

1877
01:09:26,772 --> 01:09:28,574
You should go for it, Jae Seok.

1878
01:09:28,574 --> 01:09:30,843
I'll just watch them play.

1879
01:09:30,843 --> 01:09:32,578
(Their competition
gets more intense.)

1880
01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:36,048
If Jae Seok fails this round,
we'll get four choices.

1881
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:39,552
(Jae Seok only has 1 knife left.)

1882
01:09:39,552 --> 01:09:40,853
You lose if it pops.

1883
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:43,222
Okay.

1884
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:44,990
What will you do now?

1885
01:09:45,324 --> 01:09:46,992
- I'll bet more.
- This time...

1886
01:09:47,259 --> 01:09:50,062
Ji Hyo already made a bet of eight.

1887
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:52,231
- You must stick 4 more.
- Is it 4?

1888
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:53,499
My goodness.

1889
01:09:53,766 --> 01:09:55,734
I'm so glad that
I didn't play this round.

1890
01:09:57,036 --> 01:09:58,170
My goodness.

1891
01:09:58,170 --> 01:09:59,405
(What's up with everyone?)

1892
01:10:00,206 --> 01:10:03,142
She'll answer correctly
and win this round.

1893
01:10:03,642 --> 01:10:05,811
- Right.
- It'll be over.

1894
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:07,446
That would be amazing.

1895
01:10:07,513 --> 01:10:08,614
There aren't many left.

1896
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:09,615
(Will she be lucky again?)

1897
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:11,050
She had the most fortune this year.

1898
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:13,185
Okay!

1899
01:10:13,185 --> 01:10:15,187
(It pops.)

1900
01:10:15,187 --> 01:10:16,455
Goodness.

1901
01:10:16,589 --> 01:10:18,824
I only benefited others.

1902
01:10:18,824 --> 01:10:21,393
- You need to stick 1 more.
- Stick 1 more.

1903
01:10:21,393 --> 01:10:22,795
If it pops this time,
you'll lose double.

1904
01:10:22,795 --> 01:10:25,164
(If she fails,
she loses double the amount.)

1905
01:10:25,164 --> 01:10:26,499
Double the amount?

1906
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:31,670
(She fails for the second time.)

1907
01:10:31,904 --> 01:10:33,038
Yes!

1908
01:10:33,038 --> 01:10:35,508
(Lucky Ji Hyo loses her luck.)

1909
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:37,977
(The barrel man pops up every time
Ji Hyo sticks in a knife.)

1910
01:10:37,977 --> 01:10:39,311
What's going on?

1911
01:10:39,378 --> 01:10:40,546
- Ji Hyo.
- Goodness.

1912
01:10:41,146 --> 01:10:42,615
How could this happen?

1913
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:45,684
(She returns 18 of her knives.)

1914
01:10:45,684 --> 01:10:47,586
I wanted to win.

1915
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,257
Jae Seok bet eight knives so far.

1916
01:10:51,257 --> 01:10:54,026
It's time to answer the question.

1917
01:10:54,059 --> 01:10:55,127
What will you do, Kwang Soo?

1918
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,629
If he's wrong, do I get the chance?

1919
01:10:56,629 --> 01:10:57,997
- Can I go after Kwang Soo?
- Okay.

1920
01:10:58,063 --> 01:10:59,865
- You're after Kwang Soo.
- Right?

1921
01:10:59,865 --> 01:11:01,634
- I forgot about So Min.
- I stuck three knives.

1922
01:11:01,634 --> 01:11:03,469
Gosh, that's right.

1923
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:06,105
If So Min takes all,
that would be incredible.

1924
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:09,074
All the bold ones made a bet.

1925
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:11,877
Let's watch Jae Seok lose.

1926
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:13,679
- Ji Hyo.
- Narrow down the answers.

1927
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,114
Ji Hyo started the game for us.

1928
01:11:15,848 --> 01:11:18,350
- I didn't even get to play.
- Let's go.

1929
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,785
(The real competition starts now.)

1930
01:11:19,919 --> 01:11:21,754
There's no way that
he'll answer correctly.

1931
01:11:21,754 --> 01:11:27,393
(Which number will Jae Seok guess?)

1932
01:11:27,393 --> 01:11:28,494
Number three, dog.

1933
01:11:28,494 --> 01:11:31,764
(Jae Seok chooses number 3.)

1934
01:11:31,764 --> 01:11:33,432
(Is number 3 the right answer?)

1935
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:34,567
Three.

1936
01:11:34,567 --> 01:11:35,834
- Is it dog?
- Dog.

1937
01:11:36,635 --> 01:11:41,907
(If he gets it wrong,
the others get their chance.)

1938
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:04,730
Number three, dog.

1939
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:05,264
(Jae Seok chooses number 3.)

1940
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,756
(Is number 3 the right answer?)

1941
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,844
Three.

1942
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,380
- Is it dog?
- Dog.

1943
01:12:10,036 --> 01:12:12,004
(If he gets it wrong,
the others get their chance.)

1944
01:12:15,274 --> 01:12:17,780
Is number three dog?

1945
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:19,278
(Incorrect)

1946
01:12:19,612 --> 01:12:21,880
- My goodness.
- Jae Seok is eliminated.

1947
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:26,185
(Passionate Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1948
01:12:26,185 --> 01:12:29,922
- Bye, you're eliminated
- Bye, you're eliminated

1949
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:32,658
Kwang Soo made a bet of seven.

1950
01:12:32,891 --> 01:12:35,527
Answers to the last 2 questions
were 1.

1951
01:12:35,561 --> 01:12:37,162
- Don't win.
- It's either 2 or 4.

1952
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:39,465
The question is easy.

1953
01:12:39,465 --> 01:12:41,600
That means the choices were...

1954
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:43,068
one, spoon worms.

1955
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:45,704
Two, dog meat.

1956
01:12:45,971 --> 01:12:48,340
- Four is most likely.
- In 5, 4...

1957
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,342
Four, dog.

1958
01:12:50,843 --> 01:12:54,013
- No.
- Is number four dog?

1959
01:12:54,813 --> 01:12:57,549
(His choice is correct.)

1960
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:58,984
Yes!

1961
01:12:58,984 --> 01:13:03,222
(The competition was fierce.
The final winner is Kwang Soo.)

1962
01:13:03,222 --> 01:13:04,289
Kwang Soo.

1963
01:13:04,289 --> 01:13:06,659
I was thinking that too.

1964
01:13:07,493 --> 01:13:08,594
The question was easy.

1965
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:09,762
The choice would be the last.

1966
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:10,996
(Number 4 is the answer.)

1967
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,565
Here's the next question.

1968
01:13:13,565 --> 01:13:15,868
I'll win this time no matter what.
Don't joke around.

1969
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:19,304
Among the choices,
which doesn't appear...

1970
01:13:20,472 --> 01:13:23,342
in a children's song called
"Butterfly"?

1971
01:13:23,842 --> 01:13:25,711
One, yellow butterfly.

1972
01:13:26,045 --> 01:13:27,780
Two, swallowtail butterfly.

1973
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,715
Three, swallow.

1974
01:13:29,715 --> 01:13:31,150
Four, white butterfly.

1975
01:13:31,884 --> 01:13:33,318
I know the answer.

1976
01:13:34,053 --> 01:13:35,254
I bet three.

1977
01:13:35,921 --> 01:13:38,190
(She definitely knows the answer.)

1978
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:39,658
Let me win once.

1979
01:13:41,593 --> 01:13:43,295
(So Min bets 3 knives.)

1980
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:44,530
I bet four.

1981
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:45,831
(Jae Seok bets 4 knives.)

1982
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:47,866
Okay.

1983
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:50,135
I compete against So Min again.

1984
01:13:50,736 --> 01:13:53,372
(Butterfly, butterfly,
fly over here)

1985
01:13:53,372 --> 01:13:55,908
(Here's the correct answer
for the viewers.)

1986
01:13:55,908 --> 01:13:58,544
(Number 2, swallowtail butterfly)

1987
01:13:58,644 --> 01:14:00,679
I bet five knives.

1988
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:03,048
I'll stick five knives.

1989
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:04,349
(Everyone gets competitive.)

1990
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:06,318
If we aren't careful, I'll lose.

1991
01:14:07,019 --> 01:14:08,220
Isn't it white butterfly?

1992
01:14:08,454 --> 01:14:09,588
No.

1993
01:14:09,688 --> 01:14:11,223
Swallowtail butterfly,
white butterfly

1994
01:14:11,223 --> 01:14:13,225
- Come as you dance
- Come

1995
01:14:13,225 --> 01:14:14,293
- The spring breeze
- The spring breeze

1996
01:14:14,293 --> 01:14:15,594
The yellow butterfly is missing.

1997
01:14:15,594 --> 01:14:17,329
- The yellow butterfly?
- Yes.

1998
01:14:17,963 --> 01:14:20,032
The yellow butterfly.
Was it number one?

1999
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,802
- I haven't heard it for so long.
- Right?

2000
01:14:23,802 --> 01:14:24,870
(Ji Hyo and So Min are stuck.)

2001
01:14:24,903 --> 01:14:26,405
Next person.

2002
01:14:26,405 --> 01:14:27,439
(Kwang Soo makes his bet.)

2003
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:29,241
(There is only one left.)

2004
01:14:29,241 --> 01:14:30,409
The last one.

2005
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,278
Oh, no. Goodbye.

2006
01:14:33,645 --> 01:14:35,380
(Goodbye, Kwang Soo.)

2007
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,782
Goodbye. And...

2008
01:14:37,382 --> 01:14:39,051
No, I'm going to bet more.

2009
01:14:40,018 --> 01:14:41,987
We just got rid of a tiger moth.

2010
01:14:41,987 --> 01:14:42,988
(The whole place is
filled with tiger moths.)

2011
01:14:42,988 --> 01:14:44,256
- Wait.
- Please.

2012
01:14:45,057 --> 01:14:46,058
So Min.

2013
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:47,693
(So Min is making a rash bet
with the wrong answer.)

2014
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:48,761
Okay.

2015
01:14:49,762 --> 01:14:52,931
(The tiger moth war continues
until one drops out.)

2016
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:53,999
Okay.

2017
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,702
- Yes.
- Is she going to continue?

2018
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:02,841
(Goodness, So Min knows.)

2019
01:15:02,841 --> 01:15:04,042
So Min knows.

2020
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,311
You just bet six of them.

2021
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:07,346
You're right.

2022
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:09,648
- Tell me the answer.
- Two, swallowtail butterfly.

2023
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:11,784
Two, swallowtail butterfly.

2024
01:15:11,784 --> 01:15:13,485
(That's the wrong answer.)

2025
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:15,087
- Two, swallowtail butterfly.
- Yes.

2026
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:16,889
That's it.

2027
01:15:18,056 --> 01:15:19,591
(They get six more knives
thanks to Jae Seok.)

2028
01:15:19,591 --> 01:15:20,959
"Yellow butterfly
and white butterfly"

2029
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:22,060
- Yes.
- Right.

2030
01:15:22,094 --> 01:15:23,462
"Even sparrows tweet"

2031
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:25,964
Swallowtail and white butterfly

2032
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:29,101
- We thought it was the yellow.
- We both thought...

2033
01:15:29,101 --> 01:15:30,803
We went with swallowtail butterfly.

2034
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:33,338
- Okay.
- It's not swallowtail butterfly.

2035
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:35,808
Here's the current score.

2036
01:15:35,808 --> 01:15:37,142
The current number of knives.

2037
01:15:37,142 --> 01:15:39,611
(With two questions left, these are
the number of knives they have.)

2038
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:41,780
(Jong Kook is the current winner.)

2039
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,182
Is Jong Kook winning?

2040
01:15:43,182 --> 01:15:44,883
- He's leading with 26.
- I didn't do anything.

2041
01:15:44,883 --> 01:15:45,884
He just sat around.

2042
01:15:45,884 --> 01:15:47,619
- That's why he has 26.
- Wow, really?

2043
01:15:47,853 --> 01:15:48,921
I'll keep it going.

2044
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:50,589
He's very cautious.

2045
01:15:51,056 --> 01:15:53,225
That's just my personality.

2046
01:15:53,225 --> 01:15:54,293
(I'll make my bet when I'm sure.)

2047
01:15:54,293 --> 01:15:56,128
Now, I have another picture quiz.

2048
01:15:56,461 --> 01:15:58,831
You can take a close look
and answer it correctly.

2049
01:15:58,964 --> 01:16:01,800
When you order pizza,
this thing sits in the middle.

2050
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,203
What is this called?

2051
01:16:04,903 --> 01:16:06,538
I know this because
I've worked at a pizza place.

2052
01:16:07,139 --> 01:16:09,908
One, pizza holder.

2053
01:16:10,642 --> 01:16:12,611
Two, pizza guard.

2054
01:16:13,312 --> 01:16:15,347
Three, pizza saver.

2055
01:16:15,814 --> 01:16:17,549
Four, pizza stick.

2056
01:16:18,584 --> 01:16:19,718
I don't think he knows.

2057
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:21,587
I bet three.

2058
01:16:21,753 --> 01:16:24,656
- I'm going.
- If he's sure, I won't jump in.

2059
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,659
(Se Chan, the ex-pizza part timer,
attempts to save himself.)

2060
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:28,794
I bet three.

2061
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:30,829
I bet...

2062
01:16:31,663 --> 01:16:33,031
This will be the hardest year yet.

2063
01:16:33,031 --> 01:16:34,900
(I'll have to wait this year.)

2064
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:38,670
- How many can I bet?
- You can join with four.

2065
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:40,172
(No one wants to step in
because Se Chan is so sure.)

2066
01:16:40,172 --> 01:16:41,673
If he's perfectly sure, there's...

2067
01:16:41,673 --> 01:16:42,741
Are you completely sure?

2068
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:44,509
I used to deliver pizza.

2069
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:45,777
He's going to take this to the end.

2070
01:16:46,712 --> 01:16:47,846
So Min.

2071
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,148
- Will you jump in?
- I'll bet five.

2072
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:51,216
Okay, jump in.

2073
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:52,551
- Fine.
- Okay.

2074
01:16:54,086 --> 01:16:55,220
There's no reason to save these.

2075
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,322
- Oh, good.
- There's no reason to save these.

2076
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,358
(Kwang Soo is eliminated at once
as always.)

2077
01:16:59,358 --> 01:17:01,226
That's the Kwang Soo we know.

2078
01:17:01,593 --> 01:17:02,895
Kwang Soo is back.

2079
01:17:02,895 --> 01:17:03,896
(The Kwang Soo we know is back.)

2080
01:17:03,896 --> 01:17:07,499
- There he is.
- Kwang Soo returns. Welcome back.

2081
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:09,368
There he is.

2082
01:17:09,568 --> 01:17:11,503
No, you have to use that one.
You can't use that one anymore.

2083
01:17:11,937 --> 01:17:13,672
If it pops out again,
we're taking away twice as much.

2084
01:17:16,275 --> 01:17:18,043
- Wow.
- Wow, that's unbelievable.

2085
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,646
(Kwang Soo of 2018
just got unluckier than ever.)

2086
01:17:20,646 --> 01:17:22,214
- This is insane.
- That's who you are.

2087
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:24,149
Welcome back, Kwang Soo.

2088
01:17:24,383 --> 01:17:25,550
Welcome.

2089
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:26,885
(Kwang Soo became the MVP again
with his unlucky hand.)

2090
01:17:27,552 --> 01:17:28,887
That's amazing.

2091
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:30,789
How does he do that?

2092
01:17:31,089 --> 01:17:32,224
Do you know how sad I was...

2093
01:17:32,224 --> 01:17:33,725
- because you seemed normal now?
- Me too.

2094
01:17:33,725 --> 01:17:34,960
I was worried.

2095
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,262
It was as if a superhero
lost his supernatural power.

2096
01:17:37,262 --> 01:17:38,530
My gosh.

2097
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:40,832
Kwang Soo got eliminated,

2098
01:17:40,832 --> 01:17:42,834
so So Min gets the first chance
to give an answer.

2099
01:17:45,003 --> 01:17:46,238
I don't know this.

2100
01:17:47,072 --> 01:17:48,307
I have to take a guess.

2101
01:17:48,607 --> 01:17:49,808
I don't know the answer.

2102
01:17:49,808 --> 01:17:51,843
(What's this thing that holds
a pizza down in a box?)

2103
01:17:52,344 --> 01:17:53,912
One, pizza holder.

2104
01:17:55,514 --> 01:17:57,449
- One, pizza holder.
- No?

2105
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:00,252
It's wrong?

2106
01:18:01,653 --> 01:18:02,988
Wait, it's not pizza holder?

2107
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,056
What?

2108
01:18:04,156 --> 01:18:05,424
What do you mean?

2109
01:18:05,490 --> 01:18:06,992
Which pizza shop did you work at?

2110
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:10,095
"Hey, go place
the pizza holder there."

2111
01:18:10,095 --> 01:18:12,264
Maybe the owner made it up
and called it...

2112
01:18:12,264 --> 01:18:13,832
- a pizza holder.
- "Put the holder in."

2113
01:18:13,832 --> 01:18:15,434
He said that before I went out.

2114
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,769
"Bring the holders."
That's what he said.

2115
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:20,539
It was a term that was only
used at that shop.

2116
01:18:21,139 --> 01:18:22,174
Pizza guard was number two, right?

2117
01:18:22,174 --> 01:18:24,876
Se Chan, if you get this right,
you'll be winning.

2118
01:18:26,011 --> 01:18:28,080
I choose number two, pizza guard.

2119
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:30,983
You just chose
number two, pizza guard.

2120
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,751
Yes, number two, pizza guard.
Why are you asking again?

2121
01:18:32,818 --> 01:18:34,319
Two, pizza guard.

2122
01:18:36,722 --> 01:18:37,956
What was that?

2123
01:18:38,824 --> 01:18:41,626
The question is over. The answer is
number three, pizza saver.

2124
01:18:41,994 --> 01:18:44,463
- It's number three.
- It's pizza saver.

2125
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,833
Then why did my employer
tell me to bring the holders?

2126
01:18:48,233 --> 01:18:50,502
That's easier to say.

2127
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:53,238
(Se Chan the ex-pizza delivery guy
loses 3 knives.)

2128
01:18:53,672 --> 01:18:55,741
- Here's the question.
- It's the last one.

2129
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:57,109
Let's do this one.

2130
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:59,378
How many do I have?
Am I in second place?

2131
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:02,014
- How should I...
- Give me one moment.

2132
01:19:02,014 --> 01:19:03,248
I didn't do anything,
and I'm in second place.

2133
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:05,884
- I'll jump in with this one.
- What if I double mine?

2134
01:19:06,518 --> 01:19:09,688
This question isn't too hard either.

2135
01:19:09,755 --> 01:19:12,124
- We have to get this one right.
- It's the last question.

2136
01:19:12,858 --> 01:19:14,793
You all know the Chinese dish,
ganjjajang, right?

2137
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:15,794
- Yes.
- Yes.

2138
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:17,963
- I used to work at a Chinese place.
- Ganjjajang from Chinese places.

2139
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:19,965
- I really did.
- You worked at a Chinese place?

2140
01:19:19,965 --> 01:19:21,199
Yes, I was the delivery guy.

2141
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,801
In the word "ganjjajang",

2142
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:26,471
gan is a Chinese character.
What does this character mean?

2143
01:19:26,571 --> 01:19:27,706
Gan?

2144
01:19:27,773 --> 01:19:30,375
One, to see.

2145
01:19:31,343 --> 01:19:33,979
- Two, to become dry.
- To become dry.

2146
01:19:34,379 --> 01:19:37,015
- Three, between.
- Between.

2147
01:19:37,182 --> 01:19:39,551
Four, sincerity.

2148
01:19:40,085 --> 01:19:41,453
- I'll answer.
- Se Chan...

2149
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:42,788
- So Min.
- I bet 10 knives.

2150
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:46,291
Okay. Haha jumped in first
with 10 knives.

2151
01:19:46,291 --> 01:19:47,492
It's game over if it pops up, right?

2152
01:19:48,093 --> 01:19:50,262
If it pops up, it's game over,
and Jong Kook wins.

2153
01:19:50,262 --> 01:19:51,263
That's...

2154
01:19:51,263 --> 01:19:52,330
(If it pops up, Jong Kook will win.)

2155
01:19:52,330 --> 01:19:53,899
I'm going to jump in too.

2156
01:19:54,032 --> 01:19:55,434
- Here we go.
- Come on.

2157
01:19:55,434 --> 01:19:56,435
(Haha bets 10 knives.)

2158
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:57,636
Here we go with 10 knives.

2159
01:19:58,603 --> 01:20:00,939
(Goodness)

2160
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:02,808
(Did it pop out right away?)

2161
01:20:02,808 --> 01:20:03,842
Okay.

2162
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,177
- Wow, it popped out.
- All right.

2163
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:07,312
He went overboard with
betting 10 knives.

2164
01:20:07,312 --> 01:20:08,413
(He has to pluck in 9 more knives
into the 2nd barrel.)

2165
01:20:10,382 --> 01:20:12,717
(Wait, will I end up
winning like this?)

2166
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:14,619
How did that pop out right away?

2167
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:15,687
It's game over once it pops out.

2168
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:16,855
Game over.

2169
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:18,023
(Wait.)

2170
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:20,392
(That means the winner is...)

2171
01:20:20,392 --> 01:20:21,960
Haha, 20 knives are
taken away from you.

2172
01:20:22,461 --> 01:20:23,628
The game is...

2173
01:20:24,262 --> 01:20:26,398
- over as of now.
- It's over.

2174
01:20:26,965 --> 01:20:28,433
- How can this be?
- How can it be?

2175
01:20:28,433 --> 01:20:29,601
How can...

2176
01:20:29,601 --> 01:20:31,770
- We solved one question.
- Great job, everyone.

2177
01:20:32,104 --> 01:20:34,072
- Jong Kook didn't do anything.
- Why does he get to win?

2178
01:20:34,072 --> 01:20:35,173
That's it.

2179
01:20:35,173 --> 01:20:37,409
- How can this be?
- He didn't do anything.

2180
01:20:37,843 --> 01:20:40,011
It's always the best idea
to play it safe.

2181
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:42,013
Everyone, gambling
isn't good for you.

2182
01:20:42,013 --> 01:20:43,582
- What happened?
- Don't gamble.

2183
01:20:44,182 --> 01:20:46,351
Haha lost 20,
so he now has 1, not 21.

2184
01:20:46,351 --> 01:20:48,887
It feels as if I am stuck in
a pitch-black room.

2185
01:20:48,887 --> 01:20:50,422
(Was his fortune correct?)

2186
01:20:50,422 --> 01:20:52,290
- Can we play one more round?
- Don't gamble, everyone.

2187
01:20:52,858 --> 01:20:53,959
- Last round?
- Last one.

2188
01:20:54,226 --> 01:20:55,594
- Last one?
- Jong Kook, it's up to...

2189
01:20:55,594 --> 01:20:57,162
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

2190
01:20:57,529 --> 01:21:00,265
I didn't do anything to win.
It'll be weird if I stopped this.

2191
01:21:00,265 --> 01:21:02,400
Yes, thank you.
Then Haha can take a rest.

2192
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,003
- Haha is bankrupt.
- Yes, he is.

2193
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:10,142
- We'll keep the same question.
- Okay, thank you.

2194
01:21:10,142 --> 01:21:11,309
(The question remains the same.)

2195
01:21:11,309 --> 01:21:14,679
(The real, final round)

2196
01:21:14,779 --> 01:21:15,881
All right.

2197
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,582
We're starting again from now.

2198
01:21:17,682 --> 01:21:19,251
I want to join too.

2199
01:21:19,317 --> 01:21:20,685
- It's too late. Go back.
- Why?

2200
01:21:20,685 --> 01:21:21,953
- How many?
- Seven.

2201
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:23,021
- Then...
- Me too.

2202
01:21:23,021 --> 01:21:24,222
I'm going to begin at eight.

2203
01:21:24,222 --> 01:21:25,624
(Just take a rest.)

2204
01:21:25,624 --> 01:21:27,492
No, Jae Seok.

2205
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:29,594
- How many do you have?
- Only six.

2206
01:21:29,594 --> 01:21:32,297
- You're out. It's just you and me.
- I'm going to bet eight.

2207
01:21:32,697 --> 01:21:34,132
I want to bet eight.

2208
01:21:34,132 --> 01:21:36,201
Gosh, I hate him.

2209
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:37,869
Jae Seok bet eight.

2210
01:21:38,069 --> 01:21:39,371
- 8 knives?
- There's 1.

2211
01:21:42,607 --> 01:21:43,975
- Okay.
- Okay, you're done.

2212
01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:47,512
(He gets eliminated
at the second knife.)

2213
01:21:47,712 --> 01:21:49,881
- What was that?
- Wait, Jae Seok.

2214
01:21:49,881 --> 01:21:52,551
- You need to keep this going.
- How did he do that?

2215
01:21:52,551 --> 01:21:54,152
You need to push in
the rest of the knives.

2216
01:21:54,152 --> 01:21:55,820
I think I'm going to cry.

2217
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,556
Come on, put them in.

2218
01:21:57,622 --> 01:21:58,924
You still have a chance.

2219
01:21:59,291 --> 01:22:00,425
My gosh.

2220
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,395
What?

2221
01:22:03,395 --> 01:22:04,729
(Again?)

2222
01:22:04,729 --> 01:22:06,031
This has to be a prank.

2223
01:22:06,097 --> 01:22:07,399
How did he do that?

2224
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:09,301
- Really?
- How does this make any sense?

2225
01:22:09,301 --> 01:22:10,502
- What is this?
- Really?

2226
01:22:10,502 --> 01:22:13,104
Jae Seok, we'll take away
16 knives. You have 3 left.

2227
01:22:13,104 --> 01:22:15,073
(Jae Seok gets 16 knives taken away,
leaving him with 3.)

2228
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:17,442
- Jong Kook is still winning.
- I have eight.

2229
01:22:17,442 --> 01:22:18,910
That's amazing.

2230
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,545
- Ji Hyo.
- My gosh.

2231
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:21,713
My goodness.

2232
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:23,081
To be honest,

2233
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:24,683
the only two that has
a chance of winning are...

2234
01:22:24,683 --> 01:22:26,451
Seok Jin and Se Chan.

2235
01:22:27,252 --> 01:22:29,054
Then you two can
put an end to this game.

2236
01:22:29,054 --> 01:22:30,422
I'll give you one more chance.

2237
01:22:30,889 --> 01:22:34,059
(The truly, last, final round)

2238
01:22:34,092 --> 01:22:35,193
Rock, paper, scissors

2239
01:22:35,193 --> 01:22:36,261
- Okay.
- You can go first.

2240
01:22:36,261 --> 01:22:38,330
(Se Chan won, so he will go first.)

2241
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:41,600
If this pops up again, something is
just telling us to stop.

2242
01:22:42,267 --> 01:22:45,637
To win against Jong Kook,
you have to bet more than six.

2243
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:46,871
Six?

2244
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:48,773
Let's start with six.

2245
01:22:48,773 --> 01:22:50,208
- 6 knives, okay.
- Let's start with 6.

2246
01:22:50,642 --> 01:22:52,544
- Let's do it.
- One.

2247
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,713
(Feeling nervous)

2248
01:22:54,713 --> 01:22:56,448
What if Jong Kook wins
without lifting a finger...

2249
01:22:56,448 --> 01:22:58,817
(What if Jong Kook wins
without lifting a finger...)

2250
01:22:58,817 --> 01:23:00,252
(Jong Kook wins
without lifting a finger.)

2251
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:01,686
Forget it.

2252
01:23:01,686 --> 01:23:03,121
We're done. I'm quitting.

2253
01:23:03,188 --> 01:23:05,924
(Forget it!)

2254
01:23:05,924 --> 01:23:08,560
- You have to put in the rest.
- Jong Kook didn't do anything.

2255
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:11,263
That's unbelievable.

2256
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:13,632
- Is someone playing a joke on us?
- No.

2257
01:23:13,632 --> 01:23:15,734
- Are you doing this?
- How could we?

2258
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:16,935
Did you do something to this?

2259
01:23:16,935 --> 01:23:19,604
- Maybe you have a button.
- We don't.

2260
01:23:19,604 --> 01:23:21,473
- They might have a button.
- Then lift up both of your arms.

2261
01:23:21,473 --> 01:23:23,141
- I mean...
- We have to investigate.

2262
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:25,710
Everyone, stop gambling.

2263
01:23:26,011 --> 01:23:27,779
Hey, go through their pockets.

2264
01:23:28,013 --> 01:23:29,814
- Who's doing this?
- Who has a hand in their pocket?

2265
01:23:29,814 --> 01:23:31,116
I'm not doing this.

2266
01:23:31,583 --> 01:23:33,985
Everyone, do you need
another chance?

2267
01:23:33,985 --> 01:23:36,121
We can't do that.
We don't have more players.

2268
01:23:36,121 --> 01:23:38,056
- Forget it.
- We lost.

2269
01:23:38,123 --> 01:23:39,724
Isn't the answer number two?

2270
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:41,793
The answer is two, to become dry.

2271
01:23:41,793 --> 01:23:44,629
Exactly. That was
the only question I actually knew.

2272
01:23:45,263 --> 01:23:46,665
Wait, isn't it sincerity?

2273
01:23:46,831 --> 01:23:48,266
It's to become dry.

2274
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,202
(He's sure it's sincerity.)

2275
01:23:51,202 --> 01:23:52,871
That's what I thought too.
Number four.

2276
01:23:52,871 --> 01:23:54,105
My employer told me...

2277
01:23:54,105 --> 01:23:55,874
Do you think regular jjajangmyeon is
made without...

2278
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:57,309
- any sincerity?
- My employer said...

2279
01:23:57,309 --> 01:23:59,411
he makes ganjjajang
with more sincerity...

2280
01:23:59,711 --> 01:24:01,680
because it was
50 cents more expensive.

2281
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:02,714
(50 cents worth of sincerity)

2282
01:24:02,714 --> 01:24:04,082
Oh, so that wasn't it.

2283
01:24:04,683 --> 01:24:07,952
The winner is Jong Kook
who has 26 knives left.

2284
01:24:08,386 --> 01:24:09,554
However...

2285
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:11,656
(However...)

2286
01:24:12,657 --> 01:24:14,759
(Will it be stone or gold? The final
result is yet to be revealed.)

2287
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:18,863
The current status is
0 Gold Pouches and 8 Stone Pouches.

2288
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:22,133
(0 Gold Pouches, 8 Stone Pouches)

2289
01:24:22,133 --> 01:24:25,970
(Did everyone's pouch end up
becoming Stone Pouches?)

2290
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,306
(Thanks to the Hands of Stone,)

2291
01:24:28,306 --> 01:24:30,842
(the 6 other members
will be water-bombed.)

2292
01:24:31,343 --> 01:24:32,544
The last chance you have is...

2293
01:24:32,544 --> 01:24:36,915
for you to figure out
the two Hands of Stone.

2294
01:24:36,948 --> 01:24:38,149
Let's get them.

2295
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,685
You will each walk into
the voting booth...

2296
01:24:40,685 --> 01:24:45,223
and write the names of two people
you believe are the Hands of Stone.

2297
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:48,226
So it's Seok Jin
and one more person.

2298
01:24:48,226 --> 01:24:49,327
It's Jae Seok.

2299
01:24:49,461 --> 01:24:51,429
Hey, I'm telling you. It's not me.

2300
01:24:51,429 --> 01:24:52,530
It's Jae Seok.

2301
01:24:52,764 --> 01:24:53,898
(Do most members think
it's Seok Jin and Jae Seok?)

2302
01:24:53,898 --> 01:24:56,368
- The two, old men.
- This is really frustrating.

2303
01:24:56,701 --> 01:24:59,804
I mean, I... I won't say it
because it'll only sound weird.

2304
01:24:59,804 --> 01:25:00,905
(Jae Seok puts on bad acting.)

2305
01:25:00,905 --> 01:25:03,742
(Is Jae Seok really
the Hands of Stone?)

2306
01:25:03,742 --> 01:25:05,910
So Min, it's odd that
you aren't investigating today.

2307
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:08,146
- Me?
- You're usually curious.

2308
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,214
First of all...

2309
01:25:09,214 --> 01:25:10,915
(So Min is usually talkative.
Why is she so silent today?)

2310
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,051
Do you have an idea?

2311
01:25:13,051 --> 01:25:16,321
I don't think it's Seok Jin.
I thought it was him, but no.

2312
01:25:16,321 --> 01:25:17,322
I'm not it.

2313
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:19,023
If it's not him, who is it?

2314
01:25:19,023 --> 01:25:20,525
- I'm really not it.
- Se Chan?

2315
01:25:20,525 --> 01:25:21,760
(Is Seok Jin desperate
because he really isn't it?)

2316
01:25:23,094 --> 01:25:25,397
- I think they're these two.
- Jae Seok and...

2317
01:25:25,397 --> 01:25:27,265
Jae Seok and So Min.

2318
01:25:27,432 --> 01:25:28,900
- The two of them.
- I thought so too.

2319
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:30,068
Anyone that's not me.

2320
01:25:30,802 --> 01:25:35,006
(Hands of Stone remain in mystery.
What will happen to them?)

2321
01:25:35,774 --> 01:25:39,310
(Everyone except for Jong Kook
have begun to vote.)

2322
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:40,712
I'm sure of one,

2323
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:43,415
but I'm confused
about the other one.

2324
01:25:44,582 --> 01:25:46,317
It's either So Min or Jong Kook.

2325
01:25:47,552 --> 01:25:50,288
(Haha chooses Jae Seok and So Min.)

2326
01:25:50,855 --> 01:25:52,957
I'll go with my gut feeling.

2327
01:25:53,591 --> 01:25:55,393
Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

2328
01:25:55,393 --> 01:25:57,896
- I choose Jae Seok and Seok Jin.
- They were so obvious.

2329
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,063
(Kwang Soo is contemplating.)

2330
01:25:59,063 --> 01:26:00,131
I really have no idea.

2331
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:01,833
(Which two will he choose?)

2332
01:26:03,802 --> 01:26:07,071
(He votes for Jae Seok and Seok Jin
like Ji Hyo and Se Chan.)

2333
01:26:08,306 --> 01:26:11,242
I'll go with Jae Seok and Se Chan.

2334
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:12,343
(So Min chooses
Jae Seok and Se Chan.)

2335
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:15,980
(Another possible candidate,
Seok Jin)

2336
01:26:18,316 --> 01:26:21,085
(He chooses So Min and Se Chan.)

2337
01:26:21,453 --> 01:26:24,956
(Who's Jae Seok's partner,
the other Hands of Stone?)

2338
01:26:25,824 --> 01:26:29,294
I will announce the two
Hands of Stone now.

2339
01:26:29,294 --> 01:26:31,396
They successfully...

2340
01:26:31,396 --> 01:26:36,334
carried out their mission
so that you will all get wet.

2341
01:26:36,835 --> 01:26:39,003
And those of you
who guess them right...

2342
01:26:39,003 --> 01:26:43,308
will be excluded from
the water bombs.

2343
01:26:43,641 --> 01:26:46,945
Among the five members other than
Jong Kook and the Hands of Stone,

2344
01:26:46,945 --> 01:26:51,049
3 members guessed right
and 2 guessed wrong.

2345
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:52,717
Three people got it right?

2346
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:55,220
(The three will be
excluded from the penalty.)

2347
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:57,055
The first Hands of Stone is...

2348
01:26:57,055 --> 01:27:00,091
(The first Hands of Stone is...)

2349
01:27:00,091 --> 01:27:01,326
Jae Seok.

2350
01:27:01,392 --> 01:27:04,095
- It was you?
- It had to be him.

2351
01:27:04,529 --> 01:27:07,832
(There were two Gold Pouches left
during the last mission.)

2352
01:27:07,832 --> 01:27:10,635
(He successfully...)

2353
01:27:10,635 --> 01:27:13,571
(carried out the mission
for Hands of Stone.)

2354
01:27:13,972 --> 01:27:16,207
(Nonetheless,
I carried out the mission.)

2355
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:18,910
The second Hands of Stone is...

2356
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:20,445
Who is it?

2357
01:27:20,445 --> 01:27:22,413
(Who's the mysterious
second Hands of Stone?)

2358
01:27:22,881 --> 01:27:24,382
This person put on great acting.

2359
01:27:24,382 --> 01:27:25,550
Gosh, please.

2360
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,118
(Is she acting?
Or did she spot something?)

2361
01:27:28,052 --> 01:27:32,123
(This Hands of Stone will decide
the members who'll get wet today.)

2362
01:27:32,524 --> 01:27:33,791
Gosh, please.

2363
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:36,394
- It's Seok Jin.
- See?

2364
01:27:36,394 --> 01:27:37,896
(The second Hands of Stone is
Seok Jin.)

2365
01:27:37,896 --> 01:27:38,963
Really?

2366
01:27:40,198 --> 01:27:43,801
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and
Kwang Soo answered correctly.)

2367
01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:47,071
(Haha and So Min were wrong.)

2368
01:27:48,172 --> 01:27:50,208
(Excited)

2369
01:27:51,242 --> 01:27:53,711
(Today morning
right before the shooting)

2370
01:27:56,281 --> 01:27:57,315
We met up so early.

2371
01:27:57,315 --> 01:28:00,985
You are one of
the two Hands of Stone.

2372
01:28:01,019 --> 01:28:02,820
Your hidden mission is...

2373
01:28:03,054 --> 01:28:05,957
to share your water
with other members.

2374
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:11,496
(He got way too motivated and
offered Kwang Soo his water.)

2375
01:28:11,863 --> 01:28:12,830
The couples...

2376
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,198
(Stepping on foot)

2377
01:28:14,499 --> 01:28:16,501
(But Jae Seok did his mission too,)

2378
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:20,238
(so Kwang Soo ended up
with a Gold Pouch.)

2379
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,509
(Ji Hyo, have some water.)

2380
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:28,680
(Seok Jin never shares water,
but today, he was the water fairy.)

2381
01:28:30,014 --> 01:28:31,649
- I'm fine.
- Have some.

2382
01:28:32,817 --> 01:28:36,554
(He suspiciously kept on
doing his mission.)

2383
01:28:38,723 --> 01:28:42,026
(The water fairy successfully
changed everyone's pouches.)

2384
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,929
(Seok Jin must be
the Hands of Stone.)

2385
01:28:45,129 --> 01:28:46,130
Did you two know?

2386
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:49,667
To be honest, I thought
it was Haha at first.

2387
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:52,270
I figured out later
that it was Jae Seok.

2388
01:28:52,303 --> 01:28:56,741
He's not a guy who's considerate
enough to offer us water.

2389
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:59,143
He said something to me
which he never said before.

2390
01:28:59,143 --> 01:29:00,211
What did I say?

2391
01:29:00,645 --> 01:29:02,347
It was weird
that you offered me water.

2392
01:29:02,347 --> 01:29:03,948
Then I said, "I'm fine."

2393
01:29:03,948 --> 01:29:04,949
But you said, "Have some."

2394
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:07,452
(He sounded so awkward
saying, "Have some.")

2395
01:29:07,452 --> 01:29:08,586
"Have some"?

2396
01:29:08,753 --> 01:29:10,755
My gosh, Seok Jin.

2397
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:13,091
Ji Hyo and Se Chan are
excluded from the water bomb.

2398
01:29:13,091 --> 01:29:14,359
- Okay.
- That's awesome.

2399
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:16,094
My gut feelings were right.

2400
01:29:16,094 --> 01:29:17,962
Kwang Soo, you guessed
the Hands of Stone correctly,

2401
01:29:17,962 --> 01:29:19,797
but you have to get the penalty
from last episode.

2402
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:21,065
Right.

2403
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:22,767
(Kwang Soo will receive the penalty
carried over from last episode.)

2404
01:29:22,767 --> 01:29:25,370
(Here are the people
who will get the water bomb.)

2405
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:28,773
It's still a cold, winter day.

2406
01:29:28,773 --> 01:29:30,141
(The four members get to start
the new year with a water bomb.)

2407
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:32,944
Thanks to Kwang Soo,
I also get to receive a water bomb.

2408
01:29:32,944 --> 01:29:34,946
I want to show him
how things will turn out...

2409
01:29:34,946 --> 01:29:36,347
when he gets water-bombed with me.

2410
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:38,416
Kwang Soo, we have to
do this anyway.

2411
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:42,687
Let's not keep this on.

2412
01:29:43,221 --> 01:29:44,722
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Yes, do it.

2413
01:29:44,722 --> 01:29:46,290
- I'm doing it. Really?
- Kwang Soo.

2414
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:47,392
- Yes.
- I'm doing it.

2415
01:29:47,392 --> 01:29:48,393
- Kwang Soo.
- I'll do it.

2416
01:29:48,393 --> 01:29:50,094
- Let's take the jacket off.
- I'm doing it.

2417
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,763
- Are you serious?
- Take off everything.

2418
01:29:51,763 --> 01:29:54,132
- Okay.
- Wait, are you going topless?

2419
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:56,868
(They become competitive.)

2420
01:29:56,901 --> 01:29:58,002
Okay.

2421
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:00,071
(Their passion is
headed to a wrong place.)

2422
01:30:00,071 --> 01:30:01,139
Take it off.

2423
01:30:03,141 --> 01:30:04,509
- Wait...
- Take them off.

2424
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:06,511
What's he doing?

2425
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:07,945
- What's with you?
- What's with you?

2426
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:09,147
- What's wrong?
- Take them off.

2427
01:30:09,313 --> 01:30:10,381
- Do it!
- What's with you two?

2428
01:30:10,648 --> 01:30:12,250
Take them off.

2429
01:30:12,550 --> 01:30:13,885
So Min, stop it.

2430
01:30:13,885 --> 01:30:15,453
Come on, stop it.

2431
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:17,321
You don't have to do this.

2432
01:30:17,522 --> 01:30:20,358
- You don't have to join them.
- Stop it.

2433
01:30:20,391 --> 01:30:21,726
What's with you all?

2434
01:30:21,859 --> 01:30:23,094
Come on, take them off.

2435
01:30:23,094 --> 01:30:26,264
- What's with you all?
- Someone stop So Min.

2436
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,332
- Okay, fine.
- Let's take them off.

2437
01:30:28,332 --> 01:30:29,333
(Kwang Soo has gone crazy already.)

2438
01:30:29,333 --> 01:30:30,802
My goodness.

2439
01:30:30,802 --> 01:30:33,304
What's with you?
So Min, what's wrong?

2440
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:35,506
- Keep the shirt on.
- What's with you, So Min?

2441
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:37,842
- Why is So Min jumping in?
- What's with her?

2442
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:41,145
- Someone stop him.
- Stop it.

2443
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:42,346
That's enough.

2444
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:43,681
- Do it!
- That's enough.

2445
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,249
I'm going to take them all off.

2446
01:30:45,249 --> 01:30:46,818
- That's enough.
- Do it!

2447
01:30:46,818 --> 01:30:47,885
This isn't...

2448
01:30:48,553 --> 01:30:50,321
- My gosh.
- Do it.

2449
01:30:50,722 --> 01:30:52,724
I'm not in this insanity, okay?

2450
01:30:52,724 --> 01:30:54,092
- Of course.
- One.

2451
01:30:54,092 --> 01:30:55,560
- All right.
- Two.

2452
01:30:56,227 --> 01:30:57,228
- Let's go.
- Three.

2453
01:30:57,228 --> 01:30:58,296
(The four will begin the year
with a cold water bomb.)

2454
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:01,199
(Splash)

2455
01:31:08,606 --> 01:31:10,475
(They come to their senses.)

2456
01:31:13,344 --> 01:31:14,345
(Kwang Soo!)

2457
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:16,881
(Yes, Jong Kook!)

2458
01:31:16,881 --> 01:31:17,882
(She's having fun
not realizing how she looks.)

2459
01:31:17,882 --> 01:31:18,950
Hey.

2460
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:23,488
(Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, So Min,
and Haha receive their penalties.)

2461
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:25,623
- That was awesome.
- So awesome.

2462
01:31:25,623 --> 01:31:28,392
It's the year 2018,
the year of the dog.

2463
01:31:28,392 --> 01:31:31,763
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Happy New Year.

2464
01:31:31,763 --> 01:31:35,199
(We will run hard this year too.
Happy New Year, everyone.)

2465
01:31:37,135 --> 01:31:38,436
(In the new year,)

2466
01:31:38,436 --> 01:31:41,973
(there is something
we really wish to do.)

2467
01:31:41,973 --> 01:31:43,441
(We'll wear spandex.)

2468
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:44,542
(What?)

2469
01:31:44,542 --> 01:31:46,711
(Is Kwang Soo really
dressed in spandex?)

2470
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:47,912
Se Chan becomes a catfish.

2471
01:31:47,912 --> 01:31:49,881
(Did Se Chan really
become a catfish?)

2472
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:51,883
(Whatever they think
becomes a reality?)

2473
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:53,951
(Help us, celebrities.)

2474
01:31:53,951 --> 01:31:55,620
Is this Yoon Kye Sang?

2475
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:56,687
Are you all alone?

2476
01:31:57,588 --> 01:32:00,057
(Celebrities have joined in
to help out the members.)

2477
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:02,727
(The more they contribute,
the less they will be humiliated.)

2478
01:32:02,727 --> 01:32:05,963
(Celebrities try their best
to keep them from wearing spandex.)

2479
01:32:07,131 --> 01:32:09,000
(The New Year Star Wars)
