1
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,083
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:11,554
(Film a new TV rating notice for the new year, 2018!)

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:16,493
(The winner will have the chance to direct the TV rating notice.)

4
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:19,562
(The new TV rating notice, which will air for a month,)

5
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:23,066
(was at stake for the last week's dirty and cruel race.)

6
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,169
(In the midst of tricks, some succeeded and some failed.)

7
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:29,539
(They obtained R Ddakjis depending on the results of the race.)

8
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,041
(And)

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:34,010
(The final round will depend on the R Ddakjis they have obtained.)

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,213
(It's their last chance to be the director of TV rating notice.)

11
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:40,483
(Which member will be in the limelight of the TV rating notice?)

12
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:42,686
(Storyboards of each member)

13
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,021
(The last mission will determine the director of TV rating notice.)

14
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:46,323
- What is this? - What's all this?

15
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,958
Do we need to bet again?

16
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,260
Is this what we're doing today?

17
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,328
(The set is quite cutting edge.)

18
00:00:51,328 --> 00:00:52,829
- What's happening today? - My gosh.

19
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:54,130
This looks so cool.

20
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:55,999
The set looks fancy.

21
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,067
(Which member will win the notice?)

22
00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:59,703
Did you guys know this about So Min?

23
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,806
She told me that when she was either in high school or college,

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,607
she always sang this specific song when her time was up.

25
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,876
My parents are really strict.

26
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,746
I couldn't stay out late. I had to go home when it was midnight.

27
00:01:09,746 --> 00:01:12,515
I always sang this song when I was leaving the karaoke.

28
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:13,717
Which song? Sing the chorus.

29
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:18,121
("Good Time" by Cleo)

30
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,691
(I want to spend the night, but I need my parents' permission)

31
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,228
- You must've been with a guy. - So...

32
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,597
- She was with a guy back then. - That's why...

33
00:01:27,597 --> 00:01:30,800
- I hated that she sang that song. - She sang it for the guy.

34
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,369
- She must've sounded cute though. - That sounds about right.

35
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,803
The guy must have enjoyed it though.

36
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:36,439
- She was singing it for him. - She only picked songs like that.

37
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,208
- Gosh. You know what I mean? - It is annoying.

38
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,309
"Blue Rain".

39
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,478
Where are Seok Jin and Jong Kook?

40
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:44,347
Right now, Seok Jin and Jong Kook...

41
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:47,183
are on their way here. The previous mission took longer than expected.

42
00:01:47,183 --> 00:01:48,818
- It's rush hour now. - I know.

43
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:53,857
Se Chan must film another show, so we must wrap up by seven here.

44
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:57,127
That means all three of them are out of the race.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,495
Including me?

46
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,530
- You must go film the show. - I can participate longer.

47
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,531
You have to go.

48
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,200
So for the following mission, Seok Jin and Jong Kook will...

49
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,903
bet through the phone remotely.

50
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:08,405
- Are you serious? - Yes.

51
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:11,541
- Wait. - Cutting edge of the 21st century.

52
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:13,343
- This is so funny. - The show of the 21st century.

53
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:16,279
- When we start the game, - Okay.

54
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:18,548
- you will participate remotely. - I got it.

55
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:19,849
- Okay. - Okay.

56
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:21,918
Actually, we have to be there to feel the moment.

57
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:24,220
- That's right. - That's kind of disappointing.

58
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,288
(What is the final mission?)

59
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,591
You can acquire R Ddakjis as many as you bet.

60
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:31,561
It's a 4-on-4 mission, Along with Mistrust.

61
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,896
(Betting mission, Along with Mistrust)

62
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,731
- It's a team match. - It's 4-on-4.

63
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,732
Teach me how to play.

64
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:37,467
There will be four rounds.

65
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:41,271
Come up with a list of players after reading keywords for each round.

66
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:46,109
Bet on your team's victory or loss for each game without disclosing it.

67
00:02:46,543 --> 00:02:49,612
If you win the bet, you will acquire the number of ddakjis you've bet.

68
00:02:49,612 --> 00:02:52,449
If you lose, you will forfeit the number of ddakjis you've bet.

69
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,217
(They will either win or lose ddakjis.)

70
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:58,121
However, if you bet on your team's victory,

71
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,122
and your team does win the game,

72
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:03,126
then you will be given double the number of ddakjis you've bet.

73
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:05,628
- Double? That's a lot. - On our team?

74
00:03:05,628 --> 00:03:08,198
- I'm going to bet all in. - Me too, Jae Seok.

75
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:09,499
- Let's go with Team Nevis. - Yes, let's do that.

76
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,701
- Take Team Australia or... - We'll go with Team New Zealand.

77
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,670
- Is that what you want? - Our pride is at stake then.

78
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,538
- I'm going to take this seriously. - Fine. Okay.

79
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:19,609
(Keywords are quiz, draw of luck, 1-on-1 match, and challenge.)

80
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,544
We must win this round.

81
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:22,979
- That's right. We came this far. - Here...

82
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,949
- You should come this way. - My gosh, I'm so exhausted.

83
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:28,218
You know what's at stake on this round, right?

84
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:29,719
(Everyone, you'd better get ready.)

85
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,221
- Of course. - Five seconds.

86
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,423
- Right. - Five seconds for the notice.

87
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,491
(The winner will be the director.)

88
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:36,292
I won't be able to win. I don't have a lot.

89
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,462
All right, everyone. The first game is...

90
00:03:39,462 --> 00:03:40,964
- a quiz. - Okay.

91
00:03:41,297 --> 00:03:43,500
Jae Seok and Haha. Please come up to the front.

92
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,102
My gosh, in this team, I'm the smart one.

93
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:48,605
He's the smartest one in our team.

94
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:50,206
- That's why we feel so sad. - My gosh.

95
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,474
- I can't do it. - This is unbelievable.

96
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:55,211
Well, this might not test us about our common knowledge.

97
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,613
I might be able to win.

98
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:58,081
- That's true. - We don't know what it's about.

99
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,250
We are going to start now.

100
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,819
- Whoever solves 2 questions 1st... - Is it over then?

101
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:03,887
- will win. - Should we bet first?

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,925
Now, you will place your bets.

103
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:09,993
(The betting begins!)

104
00:04:10,326 --> 00:04:13,162
(They must bet on their member's victory or loss.)

105
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:14,430
(They will win the same number ddakjis they bet.)

106
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,401
(If they bet on the victory and win, they will earn double the amount.)

107
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,471
I have to be smart about this. It's an individual match in the end.

108
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:24,407
- It's an individual match. - My gosh.

109
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,075
Do you have 20? How many do you have?

110
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,311
- I have 38. - Write the number of ddakjis.

111
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,547
(Currently, So Min and Kwang Soo are in 3rd and 4th place.)

112
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:32,448
- Jae Seok is going to do well. - If I win...

113
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,484
- I bet he's going to win. - This game...

114
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:35,518
(Contemplating)

115
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,220
I think Jae Seok is going to win.

116
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:40,657
What? Why are you betting so many?

117
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,959
I have to beat you.

118
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:45,295
(Is that how you're going to play?)

119
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:46,796
(Thinking)

120
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:51,067
If I bet on my loss...

121
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,168
(I must win the bet.)

122
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,837
The first game is a quiz.

123
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,206
- Quiz. - Which members are playing?

124
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,976
- Jae Seok from Team Australia. - Okay.

125
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:02,712
Haha from Team New Zealand.

126
00:05:02,712 --> 00:05:05,181
(It's almost like David versus Goliath.)

127
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,849
Jae Seok will win if this is a quiz.

128
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,419
It's the same chance that I win rock-paper-scissors 10 times...

129
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,688
- in a row against you. - That's right.

130
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,958
- Cover your bet. Don't change it. - Okay.

131
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,059
(8 of them finish betting.)

132
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:19,896
I will give you the first question.

133
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,464
It's an open-ended question.

134
00:05:21,898 --> 00:05:25,001
- On archery targets, what is... - This is really hard.

135
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,638
the color of the spot for 10 points, the highest points a player can win?

136
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:31,541
(What's the color of the spot for 10 points in archery?)

137
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,209
I know the answer, but I'll keep quiet.

138
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:35,812
- Jae Seok knows a lot about sports. - Yes, he does.

139
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,714
- Try to think it over. - Isn't this too easy?

140
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,582
Really, Haha? Do you know the answer?

141
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:42,719
This is too easy. Everyone knows unless you're an idiot.

142
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:44,120
Exactly. This is too easy.

143
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,157
All right. Show your answers. 1, 2, 3.

144
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:49,525
(What are their answers?)

145
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,828
Which color did you write?

146
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:54,097
(Jae Seok wrote, "yellow", and Haha wrote, "cobalt blue".)

147
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:56,733
My gosh, "cobalt blue"?

148
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,569
(I know where he's going with this. He has bet on his loss.)

149
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:01,437
- What? - This is wrong?

150
00:06:01,638 --> 00:06:03,539
What are you talking about? Why would you write, "cobalt blue"?

151
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,607
The answer is...

152
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:06,476
The answer is...

153
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:09,479
- yellow. - That's right.

154
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,047
How could you get this wrong?

155
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:14,283
(Kwang Soo and So Min are cheering.)

156
00:06:15,518 --> 00:06:16,552
(But they are happy too?)

157
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,221
- Isn't this too easy? - I knew it.

158
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:20,089
- Jae Seok. Please! - Please!

159
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,025
We'll present you the next question.

160
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,462
When someone disturbs or gets in the way of something...

161
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:28,831
that seems promising or has potential to be successful,

162
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,199
we say that he or she is "spoiling" the situation.

163
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,735
From what is the term derived?

164
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,537
My gosh, it's so hard.

165
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:35,571
(From what is the term, "spoil" derived?)

166
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,839
It's vinegar.

167
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:40,143
It's not a candle. It's not, right?

168
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,878
A long time ago, I knew...

169
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:43,813
(From what is the term, "spoil" derived?)

170
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:46,149
(On the other hand, Haha writes his answer with confidence.)

171
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:47,917
I learned this before.

172
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:49,218
This is crazy.

173
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,520
I knew it, but I can't remember it now.

174
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,721
No, Jae Seok. You must remember it.

175
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:53,489
- I can't remember this. - Show your answers.

176
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,158
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

177
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,592
I can't remember this.

178
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,528
No way. Did I say the right answer?

179
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:00,363
- I saw this somewhere. - Jae Seok...

180
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:02,665
wrote, "vinegar" for his answer.

181
00:07:02,732 --> 00:07:04,100
Are you sure you don't remember?

182
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,002
(My gosh! He wrote, "vinegar"!)

183
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:09,539
- I can't remember it. - Haha wrote, "My gosh, it's crazy."

184
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,475
(My gosh, it's crazy.)

185
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:14,410
Haha wrote, "My gosh, it's crazy."

186
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,345
(Look at that guy. That guy is crazy indeed.)

187
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:19,916
- Oh, this is crazy - Oh, my.

188
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:22,752
I learned this a long time ago, but it was such a long time ago.

189
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:25,588
The term, "spoil" derives from...

190
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:29,025
(If vinegar is correct, the 1st round is over with Jae Seok's win.)

191
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:34,797
(In that case, his teammates can obtain double what they have bet.)

192
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,967
The term, "spoil" derives from...

193
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:40,570
vinegar.

194
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,705
(Vinegar is correct.)

195
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,210
(It derives from vinegar as too much vinegar can spoil the food.)

196
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,344
Jae Seok.

197
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:51,647
- Yu Jae Seok! - Yu Jae Seok!

198
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:52,715
Yu Jae Seok!

199
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:54,784
(Wait. The word really derives from "vinegar"?)

200
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:56,786
- Jae Seok. - My gosh.

201
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:59,222
What a bummer. I should've bet more.

202
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,390
You're so smart, Jae Seok. How did you know that?

203
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,726
He has never let me down! Never!

204
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,161
My gosh, Jae Seok is so cool.

205
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:07,263
1, 2, 3. Show us your bets.

206
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:08,464
I bet five on my winning.

207
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,399
(Jae Seok bet 5, and Haha bet 20.)

208
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,401
- Jae Seok, you'll receive 10. - My gosh.

209
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:14,137
(10 R Ddakjis go to Jae Seok.)

210
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,371
- You bet 23, right? - Yes.

211
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,539
46 R Ddakjis go to Kwang Soo.

212
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:18,207
42 R Ddakjis go to So Min.

213
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:20,343
- I also guessed correctly. - How many R Ddakjis did you bet?

214
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,711
- 20. - 20.

215
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,147
Since your guess is correct, you get 20 R Ddakjis.

216
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:26,549
Se Chan gets four R Ddakjis. Ji Hyo, how many did you bet?

217
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,284
- 3. - You get 3 R Ddakjis.

218
00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:31,587
Jae Seok wins the first round.

219
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:32,989
(Meanwhile, at the site of the remote betting...)

220
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,791
Both of you won R Ddakjis.

221
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,459
- I should have bet 20. - I get 20 R Ddakjis.

222
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:37,894
I didn't occur to me sooner.

223
00:08:37,894 --> 00:08:40,396
It's hard to stay updated at a distance.

224
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:41,497
(Jong Kook gets 10 R Ddakjis and Seok Jin gets 20 R Ddakjis.)

225
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,399
(The current rankings: Seok Jin, Jong Kook, So Min,)

226
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,101
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, Haha, Jae Seok, Se Chan)

227
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,869
(The current rankings: Kwang Soo, So Min, Seok Jin,)

228
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:48,638
(Jong Kook, Haha, Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

229
00:08:48,638 --> 00:08:52,008
With 81 R Ddakjis, Kwang Soo is leading.

230
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:54,477
He has one more R Ddakji than So Min.

231
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:57,180
What was the title of your storyboard?

232
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,683
("2018 Start Afresh", directed by Kwang Soo)

233
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:04,854
(The members get water bombed in 8 provinces of Korea.)

234
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:06,722
We can't let that happen.

235
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,991
- We must stop him. - We must stop Kwang Soo.

236
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,828
So Min's "Running Man's Sea Story" is close behind.

237
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:15,097
("Running Man's Sea Story", directed by So Min)

238
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,999
(The members star in her show as fish, seaweed, rock, etc.)

239
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,601
That's dangerous.

240
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,304
My storyboard is good.

241
00:09:21,537 --> 00:09:23,372
The next mission is a game of chance.

242
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:25,308
The representatives are So Min and Ji Hyo.

243
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,876
You choose between odd and even.

244
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,245
I will go all in. I have no other choice.

245
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,214
- Odd or even? - Odd.

246
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:32,315
Please let it be even.

247
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,316
It's even.

248
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:34,517
(So Min wins.)

249
00:09:34,517 --> 00:09:36,586
(Jae Seok hits the jackpot.)

250
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,722
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

251
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,224
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

252
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:45,361
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

253
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,763
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals", directed by Jae Seok)

254
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:49,498
(Other members play various animals in humiliating costumes...)

255
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:50,967
(and make Jae Seok shine.)

256
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,335
It's the worst!

257
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:53,736
Please.

258
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,371
We need to stop Jae Seok.

259
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:57,607
I am in second place.

260
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,408
(Haha's "Man out of a Comic Book" is in 2nd place.)

261
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:00,509
I could still win.

262
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,144
- It's still in the top three. - You need to win.

263
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:03,279
- Let's go. - Okay.

264
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,447
You need to win no matter what.

265
00:10:04,447 --> 00:10:06,082
- You can win, right? - This is my last chance.

266
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:08,384
- I only have one R Ddakji. - Me, too.

267
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:10,620
- Do you have one R Ddakji? - Yes, I do.

268
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,655
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan end up losing everything.)

269
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:14,257
Ji Hyo and I are the same.

270
00:10:14,257 --> 00:10:17,026
This mission is a 1-on-1 match.

271
00:10:17,026 --> 00:10:19,061
Before that, Jong Kook and Seok Jin will join...

272
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:20,963
- since they have arrived. - Welcome.

273
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,633
Did you win?

274
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,468
I bet 20 R Ddakjis on you losing.

275
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,937
The two of you fell far in the rankings.

276
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,573
- Doing it from a distance... - It made you lose your touch.

277
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,008
- It made me lose my touch. - Of course it did.

278
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,577
In this 1-on-1 mission,

279
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:36,846
you will kick trays with your feet.

280
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:39,682
Jump high and kick both trays with your feet spread apart.

281
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,585
The one who kicks the trays higher wins.

282
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,588
(Kwang Soo versus Se Chan)

283
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,189
He has long legs.

284
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,225
Kwang Soo, show us a kick.

285
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:51,027
Show us a kick.

286
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,862
- I am much taller than him. - That's right.

287
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:54,563
I can just raise my legs and touch the trays.

288
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:57,934
Kwang Soo could fail on purpose.

289
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,069
You know,

290
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:02,371
I can't trust Kwang Soo.

291
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,640
What is he writing? What are you writing?

292
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,342
I can't trust Kwang Soo.

293
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,610
Kwang Soo, you will do your best, right?

294
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,412
Of course. I have to win.

295
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,747
- If I win, I get twice the amount. - That's right.

296
00:11:11,747 --> 00:11:13,082
I will bet on Kwang Soo's win.

297
00:11:13,082 --> 00:11:14,984
- He gets twice the amount that way. - Kwang Soo. What did you write?

298
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,185
Is it win or lose?

299
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,553
I have to bet on winning.

300
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,555
- Tell us. - I have to bet on winning.

301
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:20,957
- Look me in the eye. - His pants...

302
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:22,258
- are too thick. - Is it win or lose?

303
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,260
(They are, right?)

304
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,328
Kwang Soo.

305
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:27,997
Play with your underwear on.

306
00:11:27,997 --> 00:11:29,165
I can't trust him.

307
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,734
(He takes off his pants.)

308
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,602
He has a point.

309
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:35,137
(He takes off his pants in front of the camera.)

310
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:37,440
He needs to win to get twice the R Ddakjis he bet.

311
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,009
(I love your passion, Kwang Soo.)

312
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:41,677
Kwang Soo, you are working hard.

313
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:44,380
Kwang Soo, you are working hard.

314
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,248
Now, the staff members...

315
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,817
are unfazed.

316
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,152
He is like a grandpa.

317
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:51,287
(It comes very normally now.)

318
00:11:51,287 --> 00:11:52,488
Please place a bet.

319
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:54,490
Bet your R Ddakjis on whether or not your team will win.

320
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:57,893
(I have to win.)

321
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:00,997
We have to take this to the end.

322
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:02,098
(Jumping)

323
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,599
- His jump was low. - He can't jump.

324
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,568
- His jump was low. - He can't jump.

325
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:07,670
(His lousy jump makes people change their bets.)

326
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,538
- His jump was low. - He is stiff.

327
00:12:09,538 --> 00:12:10,740
He is stiff.

328
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,541
(It's a practice.)

329
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,609
He is stiff.

330
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,011
This isn't an easy task.

331
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,345
Se Chan.

332
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,014
Try jumping.

333
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,715
- How? - Jump with your feet apart.

334
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:22,618
(He is far below the trays.)

335
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:24,086
His jump was lower.

336
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,389
- Seok Jin. - I will bet on Kwang Soo.

337
00:12:26,489 --> 00:12:28,657
- Don't be fooled. - I will bet on Kwang Soo.

338
00:12:28,657 --> 00:12:30,359
- May I practice once? - No.

339
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,961
Can I practice? Do I have to go right away?

340
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,829
I want to do it without the trays over here.

341
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:35,264
- I will face this way. - Try it.

342
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:40,669
(Panting)

343
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,104
Kwang Soo wants to win.

344
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,040
Does it hurt?

345
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:47,143
(Sniffling)

346
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,477
- This is... - Kwang Soo.

347
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,012
- What? - You fell on the floor.

348
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:52,214
(You are in pain, right?)

349
00:12:55,718 --> 00:12:57,686
(Grunting)

350
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,689
(He pushed the mat and fell on the floor.)

351
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:03,859
(I landed on my back onto the floor, right?)

352
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,327
Don't you feel a nosebleed coming?

353
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,929
- I can't breathe. - You must be in pain.

354
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,064
He can't breathe.

355
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,899
Why did I fall on the floor?

356
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,368
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

357
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:14,070
- What? - You fell on the floor.

358
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,304
(Get it together, Kwang Soo.)

359
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:17,339
- You fool. - Don't you feel a nosebleed coming?

360
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,809
- Don't you taste blood? - You are fine.

361
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,777
(The match begins in earnest.)

362
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:23,946
- Let's go. - Is Se Chan going first?

363
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,748
- Yes, I am going first. - Please flip over the board.

364
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,249
- This is hard. - This is hard.

365
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:28,484
Here I go.

366
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:31,287
We will have a few rounds.

367
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,523
(Since he has no chance of placing 1st,)

368
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:37,526
(Se Chan has no reason to lose on purpose.)

369
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:41,297
(Can Se Chan succeed in the 1st round?)

370
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,467
He failed. He failed.

371
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,903
(He jumped pretty high,)

372
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,506
(but his left foot didn't touch the tray.)

373
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,178
- He failed. He failed. - He failed.

374
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,814
Kwang Soo, you will win if you succeed.

375
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:01,717
- It won't be easy for Kwang Soo. - Didn't my feet touch the trays?

376
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:03,419
- Good luck. - If I fall backwards as I kick...

377
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,721
- I will succeed if I do that. - You will succeed.

378
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,923
- You can do it, Kwang Soo. - You can do it.

379
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,492
You can do it.

380
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:11,093
Here I go.

381
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:13,863
He is going to fail.

382
00:14:13,863 --> 00:14:15,965
No, he wants to do well.

383
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,234
Do it seriously.

384
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,970
(The fate of this round depends on Kwang Soo.)

385
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:24,039
(Can Kwang Soo succeed?)

386
00:14:25,674 --> 00:14:27,710
(Kwang Soo does it again.)

387
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,579
(He jumps slightly, so he won't touch it.)

388
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:32,448
He failed.

389
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,718
I can't believe him!

390
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:38,687
It could be a part of his plan.

391
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:40,189
It's not easy...

392
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,690
- to kick the trays with both feet. - That's not the case.

393
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,159
He must have bet on losing.

394
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,628
- It's neither win nor lose. - Both of them lost.

395
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:47,329
- They did, right? - It's a failure.

396
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:50,232
- It's neither win nor lose. - Both of them lost.

397
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,867
- They did, right? - It's a failure.

398
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,235
In this case,

399
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,737
there is neither a winner nor a loser.

400
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:58,307
(Now, there is neither a winner nor a loser.)

401
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:00,476
Is that the case?

402
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:02,144
Kwang Soo...

403
00:15:02,144 --> 00:15:05,247
bet everything on losing.

404
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,249
I will take the number of R Ddakjis...

405
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:08,751
everyone bet.

406
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,119
Are you taking it from all of us?

407
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,787
Yes, I am.

408
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:14,456
- Thank goodness I bet 5. - I also bet 5.

409
00:15:15,357 --> 00:15:17,459
Thank goodness. I bet one.

410
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,428
I bet one.

411
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:21,230
Will you take it from all of us?

412
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,331
(Is that how the rules work?)

413
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,699
How many did Kwang Soo bet?

414
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,501
Did you bet on winning or losing?

415
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:27,269
- I bet on losing. - Show us your board.

416
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,404
- I bet on losing. - What did you write?

417
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,639
- I took off my pants... - What did he write?

418
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,174
- to bet on losing. - What did he write?

419
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:33,742
He bet 15 on losing.

420
00:15:33,742 --> 00:15:35,477
- You are less than human! - It's not like that.

421
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,780
People bet their R Ddakjis on you.

422
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,481
He didn't bet 15, but 45.

423
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,850
- 45. - Hold on.

424
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:43,919
- Hold on. - You are less than human!

425
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,021
- It's not like that. - You are less than human!

426
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:47,957
Why do the rules work that way?

427
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,458
- For goodness' sake. - 45.

428
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,060
You failed, Kwang Soo.

429
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,529
(The current rankings: Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo,)

430
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:55,998
(So Min, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

431
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,066
(The current rankings: Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo,)

432
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:58,200
(Jong Kook, Seok Jin, So Min, Ji Hyo, Se Chan)

433
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,535
Kwang Soo.

434
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:01,237
Kwang Soo took a big loss.

435
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,239
You shouldn't have been so greedy.

436
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,974
I didn't think you would fail!

437
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,408
I couldn't do it.

438
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:09,578
Jae Seok is in first place.

439
00:16:09,578 --> 00:16:11,447
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" is in first place.

440
00:16:11,547 --> 00:16:14,016
- We have to stop it. - We can't let that happen.

441
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,285
- We have to stop it. - We will be dressed up as animals.

442
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:18,387
Haha's "Man out of a Comic Book" is on the second place.

443
00:16:18,387 --> 00:16:19,888
- It's a good one. - If you win this round,

444
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,490
yours will get chosen.

445
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,425
Should I go all in?

446
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,427
This is the final round.

447
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:29,198
The representatives for this round are...

448
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:30,933
Seok Jin and Jong Kook.

449
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,468
The mission is...

450
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,803
Dibidibidip.

451
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,438
(Dibidibidip)

452
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:38,741
I don't know how it will go.

453
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,709
It doesn't go as you wish.

454
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,611
- This one... - I don't know how it will go.

455
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:44,813
I don't have a choice but to bet on winning.

456
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:46,448
I will bet on winning.

457
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:47,750
It will give us more R Ddakjis.

458
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,917
(A lot of members go all in.)

459
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:51,020
Look. This is my only chance.

460
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,123
(Jae Seok goes all in despite being in 1st place.)

461
00:16:54,356 --> 00:16:57,059
He went all in. What is going on?

462
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,495
You're going to go all in too.

463
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:01,730
I might lose.

464
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Right? I might lose.

465
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:06,502
Seok Jin will go first.

466
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,272
Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Haha will defend.

467
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,408
Do you want me to win?

468
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:14,510
- You have to win. - I have to win.

469
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,078
The outcome depends on the number of times you hold out.

470
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,613
The number of times I hold out.

471
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,049
- Ji Hyo. - I am done if Seok Jin loses.

472
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:21,850
- Hang in there. - Nevis Swing! Let's go!

473
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,252
- Let's go. - Nevis Swing.

474
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:25,487
- Nevis... - In 1, 2, 3. Swing!

475
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,656
- He has to win. - He has to win.

476
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:29,091
- Winning is good. - Seok Jin.

477
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,659
Eliminate her right away.

478
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,428
Eliminate her right away.

479
00:17:32,728 --> 00:17:33,929
Eliminate her right away.

480
00:17:34,396 --> 00:17:35,698
- Eliminate her right away. - All right.

481
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,867
Let's begin.

482
00:17:38,867 --> 00:17:39,968
Dibidibidip.

483
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:42,004
(He eliminates her in one try.)

484
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,305
Okay.

485
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,240
He really beat her in one try.

486
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,542
Dibidibidip.

487
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,810
Dibidibidip.

488
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,112
Okay!

489
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,780
(He eliminates 2 people in 2 turns.)

490
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,649
(This is incredible.)

491
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:54,817
(Sighing)

492
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,820
(Seok Jin is ready to eliminate...)

493
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,588
(3 people in 3 turns.)

494
00:17:59,588 --> 00:18:03,058
(Can Seok Jin's third attack go as well?)

495
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,461
(He is stopped.)

496
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,164
Okay. He did it.

497
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,867
(He eliminates everyone in four turns.)

498
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,135
(He screams in excitement.)

499
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,937
- Dibidibidip. - Okay.

500
00:18:14,937 --> 00:18:16,205
(What happened?)

501
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,639
(He wins after four tries.)

502
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,974
Are you next?

503
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,042
He wins in four tries.

504
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,644
(Thanks to Seok Jin, Jae Seok is more likely to win.)

505
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:24,046
Listen, Jae Seok.

506
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:26,215
- Go easy on me during your shoot. - Okay.

507
00:18:26,215 --> 00:18:27,716
Make me look nice.

508
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:28,884
If he defeats everyone...

509
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,553
Gosh, you're terrible.

510
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:33,622
(Haha)

511
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:35,224
It's over if he defeats all at once.

512
00:18:35,224 --> 00:18:36,725
That's correct.

513
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:40,295
(Haha's fate depends on Jong Kook.)

514
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,499
(He's close to winning.)

515
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:45,234
Let's start.

516
00:18:45,601 --> 00:18:47,069
- You can do it. - If Jong Kook...

517
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:48,737
defeats all of them,

518
00:18:48,737 --> 00:18:49,738
it'll be very surprising.

519
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,340
Kim Jong Kook.

520
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,741
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

521
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,109
- Nevis. - Kim Jong Kook.

522
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:55,110
Nevis.

523
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,245
Let's do it.

524
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:58,213
Goodness.

525
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,915
It won't be easy.

526
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:01,917
Shall I start?

527
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:03,819
Here I go.

528
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,155
(Will Haha's belief in Jong Kook help him win?)

529
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:08,123
Dibidibidip.

530
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:09,725
Wait a minute.

531
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,761
Dibidibidip.

532
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:15,397
- Wait a minute. - Why?

533
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:16,899
I...

534
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:18,167
Did you bet on your loss?

535
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,668
(Did he bet on his loss?)

536
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:20,936
- He did. - Kwang Soo.

537
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,037
(I was supposed to lose.)

538
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,473
Do I win if I defend once more?

539
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:26,008
Do this next, Jong Kook.

540
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:28,076
Do I win if I defend once more?

541
00:19:28,076 --> 00:19:29,178
(Remember this, Kwang Soo.)

542
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:31,246
That would be cheating.

543
00:19:34,349 --> 00:19:35,784
Dibidibidip.

544
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:41,056
(Gosh, I fell for it.)

545
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,760
(That seemed natural.)

546
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,995
Do a fake one.

547
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:49,665
So Min, you must win.

548
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,999
You have to win.

549
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,901
Dibidibidip.

550
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,403
(Jong Kook was blocked once.)

551
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,904
I really want to win.

552
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,905
(This round determines the winner.)

553
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,007
- It's for a month. - It'd be great.

554
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,409
Dibidibidip.

555
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:02,444
(She blocks him.)

556
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,579
She blocked him.

557
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:04,813
Dibidibidip.

558
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:05,848
(Jong Kook loses.)

559
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:07,316
It's over.

560
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:10,018
(Jae Seok's victory is confirmed.)

561
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,587
I'm in complete darkness.

562
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,888
- It's over. - But...

563
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,089
I'm not happy...

564
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,625
because I don't want to become a parrot.

565
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:18,994
I won.

566
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:20,629
It's the animal kingdom.

567
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:21,730
(The winner is "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".)

568
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:24,399
The winning TV rating notice is...

569
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,236
"Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

570
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,638
What far do I go to dress up as a catfish?

571
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:30,639
- Pardon? - To dress up.

572
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,441
- I will... - How do I dress up as a giraffe?

573
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:34,977
discuss with the staff in detail.

574
00:20:35,177 --> 00:20:36,378
I'll make it happen.

575
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:39,848
It's called "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

576
00:20:40,215 --> 00:20:42,017
You'll simply dress up as animals.

577
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:43,418
(He prepares in detail.)

578
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:45,787
(There are new shocking characters.)

579
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,457
(The terrible reality of "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

580
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:52,561
(Jae Seok's shooting of TV rating notice is coming up soon.)

581
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:56,298
Everyone did a good job during the shoot.

582
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,399
Thank you.

583
00:20:57,399 --> 00:20:59,234
- Thank you. - This is upsetting.

584
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:01,904
Let's do it one more time.

585
00:21:01,904 --> 00:21:03,305
Let's do it again after one month.

586
00:21:03,438 --> 00:21:06,174
I realized how seriously I must play.

587
00:21:06,174 --> 00:21:07,175
No way.

588
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,545
I gave them good roles, but they're upset.

589
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:13,348
You must be hungry since we started early.

590
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:14,850
- That's right. - We're hungry.

591
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,819
We prepared Monday Tasting Session...

592
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:20,055
where you can eat whatever menu you want.

593
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,958
(Monday Tasting Session?)

594
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,527
- This is necessary. - I'm so excited.

595
00:21:25,561 --> 00:21:26,895
We haven't done it in a long time.

596
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,066
(It's a delicious gift from the staff.)

597
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,368
(Common lunch dishes...)

598
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:35,070
(are all in one place.)

599
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,338
Gukbap sounds good.

600
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,240
Vietnamese spring rolls?

601
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,374
Steak?

602
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:40,676
I want gukbap.

603
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:42,377
What I want now is gukbap.

604
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:45,347
- What's this? - Among the dishes,

605
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:49,418
select the one that you'd like to eat.

606
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:50,452
Okay.

607
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:51,720
- Really? - One dish we want?

608
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,721
I want jjajangmyeon.

609
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:54,156
(Jae Seok chooses jjajangmyeon.)

610
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,490
I want this one.

611
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,758
Goodness.

612
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:58,260
- I want Vietnamese spring rolls. - Get out of my way.

613
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,628
You move.

614
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,797
- Mine is steak. - Mine is Vietnamese spring rolls.

615
00:22:01,797 --> 00:22:03,398
Is that so? Mine is steak.

616
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:06,501
(Each member picks a dish.)

617
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:07,869
Did you pick a dish?

618
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,004
- Yes. - Yes.

619
00:22:09,471 --> 00:22:11,540
With the name of the dish,

620
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,308
each of you will jump...

621
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,977
on the box.

622
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,578
Four of them are filled with ice water.

623
00:22:16,578 --> 00:22:18,180
The other four are safe.

624
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,949
The menus chosen by those who fall into the ice water are eliminated.

625
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,486
The menus chosen by the ones who are safe...

626
00:22:24,486 --> 00:22:25,988
are the menus you will eat.

627
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:30,158
(They can only try the menus chosen by the 4 surviving members.)

628
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:31,393
Really?

629
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:33,495
(Only half of the chosen dishes can be eaten.)

630
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:35,697
Please stand next to the box of your choice.

631
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:38,500
- Is yours 7? - Shall I pick 4?

632
00:22:38,767 --> 00:22:40,002
I'll take four.

633
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:41,570
I'll take one.

634
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:45,641
The menus of the members who falls into the water will be eliminated.

635
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:46,642
(If you fall, say goodbye to your menu.)

636
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:47,976
I want some chicken.

637
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:49,211
I want gukbap.

638
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:50,312
(Chicken)

639
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:51,847
Please.

640
00:22:52,547 --> 00:22:53,915
Okay.

641
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,717
1, 2, 3.

642
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:57,419
(Se Chan's steak is out.)

643
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,587
Goodness.

644
00:22:58,587 --> 00:22:59,721
I knew it.

645
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:00,889
Pork cutlet.

646
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:03,725
(Jjajangmyeon and pork cutlet are safe.)

647
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:04,793
Let's go.

648
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,361
I knew it.

649
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:07,663
(Vietnamese spring rolls are out.)

650
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:08,897
Who's next?

651
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,899
(Chicken is out.)

652
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,367
- 1, 2, 3. - 3.

653
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:14,503
(Pork belly barbecue is safe.)

654
00:23:14,503 --> 00:23:16,004
That's great, Jong Kook.

655
00:23:16,004 --> 00:23:17,039
I'm hungry.

656
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,540
Shall we jump at the same time?

657
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,810
- At the same time? - Three dishes are safe.

658
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,578
(One of them is safe.)

659
00:23:23,578 --> 00:23:24,780
Please. What's yours?

660
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:25,981
- Tangsuyuk. - Tangsuyuk?

661
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,450
Jjajangmyeon is safe, right?

662
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,118
- Yes. - That's right.

663
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,887
- They'll jump together. - No.

664
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:32,888
They're similar.

665
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:33,989
One.

666
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,058
Two.

667
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:37,159
(Gukbap and tangsuyuk)

668
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:39,394
- Two. - Get a shot of Ji Hyo's face.

669
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:40,996
He said to get a shot of her face.

670
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:42,497
Is it me?

671
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,599
You can't tell each other.

672
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,867
That makes it obvious.

673
00:23:45,867 --> 00:23:47,169
My goodness.

674
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:49,471
You can't do that, Director.

675
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,539
(Don't make it so obvious.)

676
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:52,808
Let's go. 1, 2, 3.

677
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,409
It's Ji Hyo. No, it's not.

678
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:55,510
Is it me?

679
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:59,214
(Contrary to everyone's prediction, Haha is eliminated.)

680
00:23:59,548 --> 00:24:01,183
(She gets tangsuyuk.)

681
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:02,918
Is it me?

682
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,453
(He gets fooled.)

683
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,621
(The broken box reminds him.)

684
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,989
I jumped too confidently.

685
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,057
(The broken box reminds him.)

686
00:24:09,057 --> 00:24:12,127
I'm in complete darkness.

687
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:15,697
The four dishes that you chose are...

688
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:17,999
jjajangmyeon, pork belly, tangsuyuk, and pork cutlet...

689
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:19,267
for today.

690
00:24:19,601 --> 00:24:22,037
For Monday Tasting Session,

691
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:24,406
today's real race is...

692
00:24:24,406 --> 00:24:26,408
(Today's real race is...)

693
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:29,778
It's called Someone's Bad Luck.

694
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,179
- What do you mean? - Happiness with 10 Dollars?

695
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:34,149
Within five hours,

696
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:36,752
you must eat all four dishes...

697
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,587
- with 10 dollars. - What?

698
00:24:38,587 --> 00:24:41,089
You must eat all four dishes...

699
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:42,591
- with 10 dollars. - What?

700
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:43,725
(All with 10 dollars?)

701
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:44,926
All of them?

702
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,194
If you go over time...

703
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:48,597
or fail to eat all the dishes with 10 dollars,

704
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:50,699
everyone will be penalized.

705
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,000
What is he talking about?

706
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,902
- Only use 10 dollars? - All 8 of us?

707
00:24:53,902 --> 00:24:56,438
Don't you know how much one jjajangmyeon is?

708
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:57,639
What about tangsuyuk?

709
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:59,174
During the race,

710
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,909
the member who doesn't get to eat...

711
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:03,011
receives a Bad Luck Badge.

712
00:25:03,011 --> 00:25:04,446
If you clear the mission,

713
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:07,349
the one with the most Bad Luck Badges places last.

714
00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:09,618
The one who comes in last chooses another member...

715
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:11,386
to be penalized together.

716
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:12,387
Again?

717
00:25:12,387 --> 00:25:13,488
(Two members are penalized.)

718
00:25:14,456 --> 00:25:17,826
For 2018, the year of dog, the penalty is...

719
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,562
walking 10,000 steps with a dog penalty suit on.

720
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,663
(Walking 10,000 steps with a dog penalty suit on)

721
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,732
- 10,000 steps? - The penalty is taking...

722
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,168
10,000 steps.

723
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,270
Here's 10 dollars.

724
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:31,106
How can we eat 4 dishes with 10 dollars?

725
00:25:31,106 --> 00:25:33,141
We must go to cheap restaurants.

726
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,477
We should search the cheapest restaurants.

727
00:25:35,944 --> 00:25:37,746
- We don't have time. - Let's hurry.

728
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,847
Let's go.

729
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,550
(Happiness with 10 Dollars race starts.)

730
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:43,919
(Where should we go first?)

731
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,887
Wait, where should we go?

732
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:47,389
(The timer is on.)

733
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,957
- The time started. - Right.

734
00:25:48,957 --> 00:25:50,091
There goes the time.

735
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,126
(Time limit is 5 hours.)

736
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:52,327
Where should we go first?

737
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:53,428
Let's eat jjajangmyeon first.

738
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,462
- Jjajangmyeon? - Let's do that.

739
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:55,697
Jjajangmyeon.

740
00:25:57,132 --> 00:26:01,469
(They must find a cheap place to eat.)

741
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,438
- Let's go. - Machine jjajangmyeon.

742
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:05,807
- A cheap restaurant... - Let's go here.

743
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:08,476
I found jjajangmyeon that costs a dollar.

744
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:09,511
- A dollar? - Yes.

745
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,913
(Jjajangmyeon is a dollar?)

746
00:26:12,047 --> 00:26:13,548
It costs a dollar.

747
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:14,850
- Where is it? - In Gunpo.

748
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,117
Let's go.

749
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,619
Are we going to Gunpo?

750
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,754
- Let's go. It's only a dollar. - Isn't it too far?

751
00:26:19,754 --> 00:26:21,022
There's enough gas in the car.

752
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:23,558
There's enough gas.

753
00:26:23,558 --> 00:26:24,893
We should go there.

754
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,297
There's tangsuyuk for 1.5 dollars in Gangseo-gu.

755
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:32,200
- 1.5 dollars? - It's 1.5 dollars in Gangseo-gu.

756
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,869
- Let's go to Gunpo. - Hey.

757
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:35,403
Let's go to Gunpo first.

758
00:26:35,403 --> 00:26:36,404
Why are you angry?

759
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:37,539
Let's eat jjajangmyeon.

760
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:38,874
Why are you so angry?

761
00:26:38,907 --> 00:26:40,008
Let's go now.

762
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,943
- Their break time starts at 3pm. - Let's go.

763
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,378
Let's go to Gunpo.

764
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:46,448
(No one can stop Jae Seok from eating jjajangmyeon.)

765
00:26:46,548 --> 00:26:48,216
Let's go to Gunpo.

766
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,285
Let me call the restaurant first.

767
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,453
Let's call first.

768
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,722
We don't have time, so call in the car.

769
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:56,358
Why is Jae Seok so angry?

770
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,360
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

771
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,461
Close the door.

772
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:03,031
(Close the door?)

773
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,267
I'm going to Gunpo, so get in another van.

774
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:07,502
I'm going to Gunpo, so get in another van.

775
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:09,638
- What? - Wait for me.

776
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:12,107
- What's wrong? - Hurry. We don't have time.

777
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,909
- Goodness. - We have time.

778
00:27:14,876 --> 00:27:15,977
Let's get in.

779
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:18,013
- I'll sit in the back. - Goodness.

780
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:19,981
Why are you so impatient?

781
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:22,951
Hurry up. We don't have time.

782
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:24,719
Goodness.

783
00:27:24,753 --> 00:27:27,889
Jae Seok, it's in Gunpo.

784
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:28,957
(No one can stop Jae Seok.)

785
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,826
Jae Seok is so into it.

786
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,728
- What's the number? - I have to go, Bo Pil.

787
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,397
Please put on your seat belt.

788
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:36,898
I have to go, Bo Pil.

789
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:40,235
Is it really a dollar in Anyang?

790
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:41,369
How can they make profit?

791
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,471
There's a place that sells pork cutlet for a dollar in Sanbon.

792
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:45,006
- What? - We can go after Gunpo.

793
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:46,241
Let's eat everything there.

794
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,677
- Is it okay if we go? - Yes.

795
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,211
It's in Sanbon.

796
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,579
(They head to the jjajangmyeon restaurant.)

797
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:53,214
Jjajangmyeon will be delicious.

798
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,917
- Gosh, I'm so hungry. - It'll be delicious.

799
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:58,954
I like green peas in jjajangmyeon.

800
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:02,724
Fried egg with jjajangmyeon is good too.

801
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:04,025
- I agree. - Right.

802
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:05,627
I like ground beef jjajangmyeon.

803
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,329
It's with ground beef.

804
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:10,031
- It's fun to pick out the beef. - It's expensive.

805
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:12,167
It's expensive though.

806
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,769
Seok Jin, how much was jjajangmyeon when you were little?

807
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:20,175
(Seok Jin vaguely remembers how it tasted 40 years.)

808
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:22,544
- How much... - Five cents?

809
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:24,179
I'd say 30 cents.

810
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:25,747
- 30 cents. - I don't remember.

811
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,818
They had to go to China if they wanted jjajangmyeon.

812
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,653
That's not true.

813
00:28:31,653 --> 00:28:32,954
They had to go to China.

814
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,155
It was the Korean Empire period.

815
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:36,558
They had to travel to Tang Dynasty.

816
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:37,659
Tang Dynasty?

817
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,462
Tang Dynasty envoys would bring jjajangmyeon...

818
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:43,898
when they were visiting our king.

819
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,033
Exactly.

820
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,971
You used brass coins, right?

821
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:51,539
I did.

822
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,208
You did?

823
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,143
He used Joseon coins.

824
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:57,178
Joseon coins...

825
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,080
(Have you ever seen secret royal inspectors?)

826
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,615
Have you ever seen secret royal inspectors?

827
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,652
Have you ever seen horse badges?

828
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:06,388
One of my school friends became a secret royal inspector.

829
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,189
One of your school friends?

830
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,191
One of my school friends...

831
00:29:10,191 --> 00:29:11,993
He used to be such a troublemaker,

832
00:29:11,993 --> 00:29:14,529
but he became a secret royal inspector.

833
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:15,530
(He passed the 17th-century state exam.)

834
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,298
I didn't know he became one.

835
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,068
Weren't you taken during the Manchu War of 1636?

836
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:22,904
I worked as a Japanese interpreter.

837
00:29:22,904 --> 00:29:26,541
(He even interpreted.)

838
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:31,079
It's the Qing Dynasty, not Japan.

839
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,048
It is?

840
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:38,186
One of the Qing commanders was Japanese.

841
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:39,821
Were there really dinosaurs?

842
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,489
- What? - Were there really dinosaurs?

843
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,825
Did you evolve from a monkey?

844
00:29:43,925 --> 00:29:45,026
Bipedalism.

845
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,162
(Are you taking it that far?)

846
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:50,031
Can you handle this one too?

847
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:54,035
Back then, my back didn't ache.

848
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:57,272
My back became bad when I started walking on two legs.

849
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:58,406
(He'll soon remember the time he was an ameba.)

850
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:00,675
(From Seoul to Gunpo)

851
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,778
I wonder how one-dollar jjajangmyeon tastes.

852
00:30:03,945 --> 00:30:07,449
This place was going to close down.

853
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:09,684
That's why they started selling jjajangmyeon for one dollar.

854
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:10,985
- But... - It became popular?

855
00:30:10,985 --> 00:30:12,887
It became so popular, and they're still in business.

856
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:13,922
(Their one-dollar jjajangmyeon became a hit.)

857
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:15,223
That's incredible.

858
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,659
(Mouth-watering)

859
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,527
I think we're almost there.

860
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:20,962
Can't you use GPS?

861
00:30:20,962 --> 00:30:22,831
- It's in that building. - Are we here?

862
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:24,933
- I found it. "Free jjajangmyeon". - Okay.

863
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:26,067
It's that place.

864
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,669
- "5-dollar tangsuyuk". - "5-dollar tangsuyuk".

865
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:29,404
- We found it! - Tangsuyuk costs five dollars?

866
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:30,872
- Awesome. - One-dollar jjajangmyeon?

867
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,943
Is there really one-dollar jjajangmyeon?

868
00:30:35,443 --> 00:30:38,480
Can they get any profit?

869
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,617
Running Man members are about to taste one-dollar jjajangmyeon.

870
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:45,687
My mouth is watering.

871
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:50,358
Smell it. It smells so good. Ji Hyo, it smells great.

872
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,061
This costs only one dollar?

873
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:54,662
Hello.

874
00:30:54,662 --> 00:30:55,930
- Can we order? - Does it really cost one dollar?

875
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,565
Excuse me.

876
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,801
Is it okay if we shoot in the corner?

877
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,269
- Sure. - Is it okay?

878
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,337
Thank you.

879
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:03,838
(Jjajangmyeon, 1 dollar)

880
00:31:03,838 --> 00:31:05,173
Does it really cost only one dollar?

881
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:07,041
It's incredible.

882
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:10,678
Let's just eat as much as we want here.

883
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,849
Happiness with 10 Dollars. We're at the first restaurant now.

884
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:16,618
Order one portion,

885
00:31:16,618 --> 00:31:18,386
and pay for it.

886
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,456
Before we start,

887
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:23,424
let's decide how many people will eat here...

888
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,393
by playing a game.

889
00:31:26,027 --> 00:31:29,164
Choose one customer here.

890
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:32,367
The number of bills the customer has...

891
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:34,669
will determine how many people will eat.

892
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:38,039
Each member will randomly draw...

893
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:40,208
a number.

894
00:31:40,475 --> 00:31:44,679
The result will determine who will eat here.

895
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,214
Those who don't get to eat here...

896
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:49,184
will get a Bad Luck Badge.

897
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:51,119
If the customer has eight bills, everyone gets to eat?

898
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,222
The bigger your number is, the lower your chance is.

899
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:57,058
I guess up to three people will eat.

900
00:31:57,058 --> 00:31:58,660
If the customer has one bill, will only one person eat?

901
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,328
Yes.

902
00:32:00,328 --> 00:32:01,896
Eight would be the worst.

903
00:32:01,896 --> 00:32:03,097
(Smaller numbers are better.)

904
00:32:03,097 --> 00:32:04,165
Let's see.

905
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,267
I want one.

906
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,670
(Who will lucky and choose a low number?)

907
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,971
Please.

908
00:32:10,371 --> 00:32:11,472
This.

909
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:15,143
- Seok Jin, turn your spoon around. - I haven't seen mine.

910
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,046
It's five.

911
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:20,048
- Can I try again? - It's over.

912
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:21,616
It's my turn.

913
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,184
I doubt it's eight.

914
00:32:23,184 --> 00:32:24,252
(Jae Seok's turn)

915
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:28,156
- Four. - It's not bad.

916
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,258
- Three. - Three.

917
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:31,259
Three.

918
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,327
My turn.

919
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:34,128
Eight.

920
00:32:34,128 --> 00:32:35,897
(Haha picked 8.)

921
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:37,665
I'm in complete darkness.

922
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,902
It's true. You've been very unlucky these days.

923
00:32:41,569 --> 00:32:43,171
Here we go.

924
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,672
(Kwang Soo's turn)

925
00:32:44,672 --> 00:32:45,740
Six.

926
00:32:46,107 --> 00:32:48,076
4, 5, 6.

927
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,477
1, 2, 3 are left.

928
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:50,578
Seven is left too.

929
00:32:50,745 --> 00:32:52,647
Let's turn them around at the same time. 1, 2, 3.

930
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,148
(1, 2, and 7 are left.)

931
00:32:57,952 --> 00:32:59,020
It's seven.

932
00:32:59,153 --> 00:33:01,155
(So Min: 1, Ji Hyo: 2)

933
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:02,557
Yes.

934
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:03,791
It's seven.

935
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,895
- Choose one customer now. - The lady.

936
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,064
Hold on. Let's look around.

937
00:33:10,965 --> 00:33:12,800
They must be friends.

938
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,435
- There's a lady over there too. - Choose the lady.

939
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:15,637
- This lady? - Yes.

940
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:19,007
- Because... - Could we see...

941
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:21,209
how many bills you have?

942
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:23,645
Mothers usually use credit cards. It's students that use...

943
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:26,147
No, it's not like that.

944
00:33:26,147 --> 00:33:27,949
- Are you sure? - Because...

945
00:33:27,949 --> 00:33:29,417
Just sit down.

946
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:30,485
Be quiet.

947
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,021
The number of bills in her wallet.

948
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:34,656
- Just the bills? - Yes.

949
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:37,258
(The number of bills will determine how many members can eat.)

950
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:45,566
(Who will get to eat?)

951
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,634
one...

952
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:50,371
(Two bills)

953
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:52,307
She must use credit cards.

954
00:33:52,307 --> 00:33:54,242
- Thank you. - It's 11 dollars.

955
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:57,378
- Thank you. - She must use credit cards.

956
00:33:57,378 --> 00:33:59,113
(She usually uses credit cards.)

957
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:01,816
Who will get to eat?

958
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,653
Just those two will eat.

959
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:07,755
I wanted jjajangmyeon.

960
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,224
(We get to eat.)

961
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:13,928
Could Kwang Soo have been right about students?

962
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:16,497
Do you have any bills?

963
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,099
How many do you have?

964
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,467
In your wallet.

965
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,371
Wait.

966
00:34:23,371 --> 00:34:25,540
(A lot)

967
00:34:26,507 --> 00:34:29,110
- Gosh. - I knew it.

968
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,244
He has more than 10.

969
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:32,680
What did I say?

970
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,815
(Kwang Soo is speechless.)

971
00:34:33,815 --> 00:34:35,817
(We should have listened to him.)

972
00:34:35,817 --> 00:34:37,085
What did I tell you?

973
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:38,219
Students use cash.

974
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,487
You have a lot of cash.

975
00:34:39,987 --> 00:34:41,222
(Disappointed)

976
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,326
Kid, are you going to eat that?

977
00:34:45,827 --> 00:34:47,528
- Stop it. - Gosh.

978
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,830
Don't do that.

979
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,465
- You shouldn't leave any food. - Be quiet.

980
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:51,532
Stop it.

981
00:34:52,066 --> 00:34:53,167
Be quiet.

982
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:57,405
Those who don't get to eat will receive a Bad Luck Badge.

983
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,674
My goodness.

984
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:01,008
(Bad Luck Badges)

985
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,944
Two bowls of jjajangmyeon are served.

986
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:05,380
- Gosh. - So Min and Ji Hyo.

987
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,582
(They're for So Min and Ji Hyo.)

988
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,050
Like this?

989
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,318
Two bowls are served.

990
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,153
Even though we paid for one portion?

991
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,488
(One-dollar jjajangmyeon for So Min and Ji Hyo)

992
00:35:13,488 --> 00:35:15,289
- We could have all eaten. - Exactly.

993
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,158
We could have all eaten.

994
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,026
I thought we were going to share one bowl.

995
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:21,529
- Let me mix it for you. - Can I get chili powder?

996
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:24,198
I thought we were going to share one bowl.

997
00:35:24,198 --> 00:35:26,667
- So did I. - After we're done shooting,

998
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,569
come back here.

999
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:31,072
- It looks so tasty. - You can eat then.

1000
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:34,609
- I want it so badly. - Jjajangmyeon...

1001
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:36,677
She's eating it.

1002
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:38,446
Eat it with pickled radish.

1003
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:42,417
- The slurping sound. - Does it taste good?

1004
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:43,618
Eat it with pickled radish.

1005
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:46,988
It looks tasty.

1006
00:35:46,988 --> 00:35:48,022
(It's driving me crazy.)

1007
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,891
- It tastes really good. - I can't believe...

1008
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:51,025
it costs only one dollar.

1009
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,661
- It doesn't taste cheap. - There's enough sauce too.

1010
00:35:53,661 --> 00:35:56,564
- It's just right. - It's sweet and spicy.

1011
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:57,565
Guys.

1012
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:58,633
(It's sweet and spicy.)

1013
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,169
(I'm happy I'm so lucky.)

1014
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:03,938
We came all the way to Gunpo. Can't we...

1015
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:05,006
Call your friends.

1016
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:07,175
Guys, why don't we order one more bowl?

1017
00:36:07,175 --> 00:36:10,178
- Don't do that. - Can we do that?

1018
00:36:10,278 --> 00:36:14,015
If you really want to eat,

1019
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,551
- pay another dollar... - Are we going to draw again?

1020
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:17,718
Are we drawing again?

1021
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:20,988
The one who draws one will get to eat.

1022
00:36:20,988 --> 00:36:23,024
- One? - Okay.

1023
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:24,325
I want one.

1024
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,827
Let's draw one at the same time.

1025
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,695
- Draw one. - Let's do it together.

1026
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,197
Please.

1027
00:36:29,197 --> 00:36:30,398
- At the same time. - Please.

1028
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:32,266
I'm not sure if I'll be lucky.

1029
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,235
Please. Just this once.

1030
00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:35,870
Hold on.

1031
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,438
What did you pick?

1032
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:39,774
- What's your number? - Six.

1033
00:36:39,774 --> 00:36:41,876
We're 6 people, and I picked 6.

1034
00:36:41,876 --> 00:36:43,678
That was close. Two.

1035
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,214
- The rest... - I still have a chance.

1036
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:48,049
- It's your turn. - Turn it around.

1037
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:51,152
You know how much I love jjajangmyeon, right?

1038
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:52,286
Please.

1039
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,655
I want my number to change to one.

1040
00:36:54,655 --> 00:36:56,190
Jae Seok chose this place.

1041
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,259
(I want my number to change to one.)

1042
00:36:58,259 --> 00:36:59,360
Jae Seok chose this place.

1043
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,428
What are you doing?

1044
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:02,930
- Five. - I still have a chance.

1045
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,299
(Jae Seok is eliminated.)

1046
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:06,367
I have a chance.

1047
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:08,836
I actually don't want it that much.

1048
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:10,671
- Could it be Jong Kook? - Let me eat.

1049
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:12,173
I have a feeling it's Jong Kook.

1050
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:13,174
Should Jong Kook wait?

1051
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:15,276
The two of us should go first. You go first.

1052
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,544
(Kwang Soo checks his number.)

1053
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:19,180
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1054
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,915
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1055
00:37:20,915 --> 00:37:22,016
Could it be Jong Kook?

1056
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,752
(It's either Haha or Jong Kook.)

1057
00:37:24,752 --> 00:37:27,488
It's either of these two.

1058
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:29,357
- Jong Kook... - But...

1059
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,292
(Please let me eat.)

1060
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,360
- Jjajangmyeon... - Should I go first?

1061
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,761
Hold on.

1062
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,296
(Please let me eat.)

1063
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,864
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1064
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,635
(Shouting)

1065
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:43,471
(Haha is exhilarated.)

1066
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:48,976
(Haha surpassed the darkness and picked 1.)

1067
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:51,879
(My goodness.)

1068
00:37:51,879 --> 00:37:52,947
Haha.

1069
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,015
Thank you.

1070
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,317
Whatever. I'll just eat it.

1071
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:57,652
Hey.

1072
00:37:57,818 --> 00:38:00,988
You're breaking the rules.

1073
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:03,925
Pay another dollar and try again.

1074
00:38:04,358 --> 00:38:05,426
No.

1075
00:38:05,426 --> 00:38:07,562
If you run out of time,

1076
00:38:07,562 --> 00:38:08,563
- Right. - everyone will be penalized.

1077
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:09,764
Let's hurry.

1078
00:38:10,431 --> 00:38:11,966
It looks like more than one serving.

1079
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:13,568
My gosh, this is amazing.

1080
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,671
(Slurping)

1081
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:17,905
I really want to eat it.

1082
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,945
(It's driving him crazy as he can hear and see the noodles.)

1083
00:38:23,945 --> 00:38:26,948
- Doesn't it look really delicious? - Yes, indeed.

1084
00:38:26,948 --> 00:38:28,883
I will let you have a bite if you take my badge.

1085
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:30,818
(Haha, the strategist, makes a sweet deal.)

1086
00:38:30,818 --> 00:38:32,086
- My gosh, that's really tempting. - Goodness.

1087
00:38:32,086 --> 00:38:33,287
- I will give you this much. - My gosh, you...

1088
00:38:33,287 --> 00:38:34,555
I will feed you this much.

1089
00:38:34,755 --> 00:38:36,090
- If you take this. - Dear me.

1090
00:38:36,457 --> 00:38:37,858
5, 4...

1091
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,126
We have to go to four places.

1092
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:40,928
(I can't stop thinking about the slurping sound.)

1093
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:44,098
(Will someone be tempted to accept this deal?)

1094
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:45,466
- I'm in! - Okay.

1095
00:38:45,466 --> 00:38:48,636
(Kwang Soo, the lover of jjajangmyeon, is in.)

1096
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,005
(He's a slave to his desire.)

1097
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:52,506
- I'll give you the Bad Luck Badge. - You can't...

1098
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:53,741
- skimp on the food. - Okay.

1099
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:55,509
(I should've gone for it.)

1100
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:56,677
Gosh, that looks so tasty.

1101
00:38:56,677 --> 00:38:57,945
- All right. - Let me taste it.

1102
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,047
- Hey, here it is. - Give him a lot.

1103
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,749
- I'm going to give you a lot. - Okay.

1104
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:03,317
- Here you go. 1, 2, 3. - My gosh.

1105
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:05,319
I really want to eat jjajangmyeon.

1106
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:06,654
(Eating someone else's food is the tastiest.)

1107
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:09,490
(I'm not going to watch this.)

1108
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,196
- Whose badge is that now? - Can't we give it to other people?

1109
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,399
- We need to go to the next place. - Right.

1110
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,500
- Let's have pork belly. - What's next?

1111
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,469
- Let's eat pork belly next. - Yes, let's do that.

1112
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,537
There's a thin pork belly place near Bucheon Station.

1113
00:39:24,138 --> 00:39:25,640
- It's open 24 hours. - Let's go.

1114
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,941
Let's go to Bucheon.

1115
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,010
- You must order one serving. - Let's get going first.

1116
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,177
It is cheap.

1117
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:33,014
(The number of Bad Luck Badges for each member)

1118
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,950
- We'll have pork belly next. - That sounds good too.

1119
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:39,220
I'm going to put rice, a piece of pork belly,

1120
00:39:39,487 --> 00:39:42,923
garlic with gochujang on top of the lettuce.

1121
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:46,160
I'm going to eat it with salt.

1122
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,928
- I'm so hungry. - We must eat it with rice.

1123
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,296
I think we're almost there.

1124
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:51,632
- We are 3.7km away. - All right.

1125
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,169
(Humming)

1126
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:57,038
We got here faster than I thought.

1127
00:39:57,738 --> 00:40:02,076
(Seok Jin starts humming all of a sudden.)

1128
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:03,844
(Glancing)

1129
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:08,349
(Singing)

1130
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:09,817
What was the name of the song?

1131
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:13,587
(He makes a trumpet sound.)

1132
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:14,755
- What? - That was good.

1133
00:40:14,755 --> 00:40:17,091
- I was surprised with myself too. - Hey, that sounded really cool.

1134
00:40:17,091 --> 00:40:18,192
Let's try that again.

1135
00:40:18,192 --> 00:40:20,528
(They suddenly form an a capella group.)

1136
00:40:20,528 --> 00:40:22,496
(So Min joins in too.)

1137
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,765
What is that?

1138
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:28,569
(Drop the beat.)

1139
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:29,804
Hey, we sound great.

1140
00:40:30,004 --> 00:40:33,040
(Their questionable song continues.)

1141
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,577
(It's caught between being a noise and a song.)

1142
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,418
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo is enjoying the song in her dreams.)

1143
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:46,487
How could Ji Hyo sleep in this commotion?

1144
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:49,256
Is she sleeping? My gosh, Ji Hyo is sleeping?

1145
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:50,357
(It must have been the tasty jjajangmyeon.)

1146
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:52,860
- We are here. We arrived. - We're at the restaurant.

1147
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,862
- Jae Seok, it's this one here. - This is it.

1148
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:56,197
Let's eat!

1149
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:57,965
- Let's eat! - It's 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1150
00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,300
- No way. - This is the place.

1151
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,602
- Look. It's open 24 hours. - It's 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1152
00:41:01,602 --> 00:41:03,237
How could it be only 2 dollars and 50 cents?

1153
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:05,172
My gosh, thin pork belly. I love it.

1154
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:07,608
- It's only 2 dollars and 50 cents? - Hello.

1155
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:10,845
- Has the owner gone mad? - My gosh.

1156
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:13,013
- It's only 2 dollars and 50 cents? - Yes.

1157
00:41:13,447 --> 00:41:15,549
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1158
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,951
I'm sorry to ask this,

1159
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:19,787
but could we film in this restaurant?

1160
00:41:20,755 --> 00:41:22,089
- Would it be okay? - Sure.

1161
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:23,924
- Thank you, ma'am. - We'll film only on this side.

1162
00:41:23,924 --> 00:41:25,593
- Thank you! - Thank you!

1163
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:29,363
My gosh, the owner seems really good-natured.

1164
00:41:30,131 --> 00:41:33,734
(The cameras are set up quickly to film at the corner.)

1165
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:34,902
We're rolling.

1166
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:37,538
- You've arrived now. - Yes, we have.

1167
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:40,141
This time, you won't have to choose a number.

1168
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,443
- All of you might be able to eat. - Okay!

1169
00:41:42,443 --> 00:41:43,677
- Awesome. - What is the mission?

1170
00:41:43,677 --> 00:41:45,012
For this mission,

1171
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:46,514
you'll choose either odd or even.

1172
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:48,449
How are we going to play that?

1173
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:51,652
Whoever correctly guesses whether the number of spoons...

1174
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:53,053
and chopsticks is odd or even will get to eat.

1175
00:41:53,754 --> 00:41:55,189
- This is an individual game. - Right.

1176
00:41:56,657 --> 00:41:58,559
- I can shake this, right? - Yes, you can.

1177
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,827
Of course.

1178
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,496
- It sounds like there are a lot. - The chopsticks are in there too.

1179
00:42:03,497 --> 00:42:06,600
Hey, Jae Seok, what do you think?

1180
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,601
(I can pick the opposite of his choice.)

1181
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,669
I'll choose the opposite.

1182
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,738
- I'll go last. - No, tell us.

1183
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:12,973
- I want to pick the opposite. - Let's choose the same answer.

1184
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,408
What do you think, So Min?

1185
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:15,676
I'll go with odd.

1186
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,444
- Me too. - Odd?

1187
00:42:17,444 --> 00:42:18,612
- Odd? - Then I'll go with even.

1188
00:42:18,712 --> 00:42:19,980
Even, odd, even.

1189
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,882
Hey, everyone. What about this?

1190
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:24,618
If you think it's odd, go that side. Come here if you think it's even.

1191
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:25,753
- That was clever. - Okay.

1192
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:27,154
My gosh, we picked different choices. This is bad.

1193
00:42:27,154 --> 00:42:28,689
- Which side is for even? - This side.

1194
00:42:28,689 --> 00:42:30,758
This side is for even, and that side is for odd.

1195
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:32,827
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo choose odd.)

1196
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:34,862
- I'll count one by one. - All right.

1197
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:35,963
Okay.

1198
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:37,064
- Odd. - Okay.

1199
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:38,199
Don't play any tricks now.

1200
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,900
- Don't play tricks. - You think so lowly of me.

1201
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:41,602
- Even. - Even.

1202
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:43,070
- Let's all say it. Odd. - Odd!

1203
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,138
That's great.

1204
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:45,472
- Even! - Even!

1205
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:47,675
- Odd! - Odd!

1206
00:42:48,676 --> 00:42:49,877
- Even! - Even!

1207
00:42:50,578 --> 00:42:51,779
Hey, this is making me so nervous.

1208
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:53,447
- Odd. We're almost there. - We are almost done.

1209
00:42:53,981 --> 00:42:55,649
(Does he have 1 or 2 spoons left?)

1210
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:57,017
He has more.

1211
00:42:57,585 --> 00:42:59,486
- There are two left. - It looks like there are more.

1212
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:00,654
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo chose odd.)

1213
00:43:00,654 --> 00:43:02,056
(Jae Seok, Haha, Se Chan, and So Min chose even.)

1214
00:43:03,057 --> 00:43:04,258
Gosh, there are two left.

1215
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:05,526
(Fidgeting)

1216
00:43:05,526 --> 00:43:09,129
Wait, why are you putting the spoon between your bottom?

1217
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,564
- Why are you doing that? - No, this is the last one.

1218
00:43:10,564 --> 00:43:12,233
(I only have one left. There's an even number of them.)

1219
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,500
Odd!

1220
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,069
- Yes! - Hold on.

1221
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:17,037
(He finds a deeply hidden spoon.)

1222
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:18,539
- Hey. - All right. It's odd.

1223
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:19,907
(He fails to hide a spoon.)

1224
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,810
- Don't join Jae Seok. Then you win. - Seriously?

1225
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,678
I wasn't even expecting to win.

1226
00:43:24,778 --> 00:43:25,980
(The losing members will receive Bad Luck Badges.)

1227
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,715
- Four servings of pork belly. - My gosh, Jae Seok.

1228
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:29,149
They have to get the badges too, right?

1229
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:31,518
(The number of Bad Luck Badges for each member)

1230
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:34,622
(The thin pork belly is being grilled on the pan.)

1231
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,957
- My goodness. - Oh, my. Can you hear it sizzling?

1232
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:39,193
- It looks good, Seok Jin. - This is amazing.

1233
00:43:39,193 --> 00:43:40,961
Don't grill them. You have to stir-fry them.

1234
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:43,564
- Right. That's the way to go. - Stop teasing us.

1235
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:45,499
- The oil seeps out. - You're right.

1236
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,867
- Cook kimchi too. - We can cook kimchi with it.

1237
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,469
(I'd give anything to eat that.)

1238
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,037
(This is like a torture for members who lost.)

1239
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:51,672
My goodness. Look at this.

1240
00:43:52,106 --> 00:43:54,308
Seriously? You're not good at cooking pork melly.

1241
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:55,676
- Seriously. - "Pork melly"?

1242
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:58,646
- I bet you want to eat this. - You don't know how to cook it.

1243
00:43:58,646 --> 00:43:59,647
- Move aside. - Are you trying to eat this?

1244
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:00,814
No, no. Let me cook it for you.

1245
00:44:00,814 --> 00:44:02,616
- No, that's all right. - Come on.

1246
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,084
- Why are you hitting me? - There's no need.

1247
00:44:04,084 --> 00:44:06,086
- What's wrong with you? - Let me cook it for you.

1248
00:44:06,086 --> 00:44:08,088
- Why would you cook it for us? - Come on. Move aside.

1249
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:09,757
- Hey, eat up. - My goodness.

1250
00:44:09,757 --> 00:44:11,025
- Are you serious? - Why are you doing this?

1251
00:44:11,025 --> 00:44:12,326
This is how you ought to do it.

1252
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:14,228
- Unbelievable. - Hey, hold on. Hey.

1253
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:16,897
(His hands are swifter than their eyes.)

1254
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:17,965
- Get it. - Wait.

1255
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:19,500
There's a fight going on over there.

1256
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,469
(They are searching and seizing the hidden pork belly.)

1257
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:24,738
(Screaming in pain)

1258
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:27,508
I researched a lot about this while watching TV.

1259
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,077
(He's always improving as he watches the shows.)

1260
00:44:30,077 --> 00:44:32,713
I studied a lot about you.

1261
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,515
- He's bleeding! - My gosh!

1262
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:35,783
Hey.

1263
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,719
(Shall we enjoy our meal now?)

1264
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,387
- I got to taste one. - He ate one in the end.

1265
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:42,256
I ate it.

1266
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:46,627
(Place the piece of meat, a bit of doenjang,)

1267
00:44:46,627 --> 00:44:48,195
(and seasoned, sliced spring onions.)

1268
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:49,997
- It's true. - Haha.

1269
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,136
(This is the pork belly that brings joy to Ji Hyo.)

1270
00:44:56,603 --> 00:44:57,838
I gave you half of my jjajangmyeon.

1271
00:44:58,906 --> 00:45:00,841
(The meat impresses him right away.)

1272
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,078
I will buy someone's Bad Luck Badge.

1273
00:45:05,446 --> 00:45:07,247
I'm going to trade one.

1274
00:45:07,247 --> 00:45:08,349
(Haha and Se Chan get a bite and take the badge.)

1275
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:09,984
- That's good. - Why are you doing this?

1276
00:45:09,984 --> 00:45:11,552
- You're going to take my badge. - Okay.

1277
00:45:12,086 --> 00:45:13,487
- No, you can't do that. - I can't help myself.

1278
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:15,022
(It's a good deal for Kwang Soo since he has two badges.)

1279
00:45:15,022 --> 00:45:16,790
I sold my badge to him. I gave it back to him.

1280
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:20,828
(Se Chan and Haha receive 1 more badge.)

1281
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,964
- Give him your badge. - Come on, do it.

1282
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:26,166
- Yes, give one to Jae Seok. - Give it to Jae Seok.

1283
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:27,968
(Should I try getting rid of mine too?)

1284
00:45:27,968 --> 00:45:29,303
- Everyone. - Hey.

1285
00:45:30,471 --> 00:45:33,807
I will give this to whoever takes my badge.

1286
00:45:33,807 --> 00:45:35,009
No, no. Forget it.

1287
00:45:35,009 --> 00:45:38,245
(No, no. Forget it.)

1288
00:45:39,546 --> 00:45:41,382
- Gosh, he's so annoying. - Forget it.

1289
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:43,717
Why would I take his badge?

1290
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:45,886
- Why would I do that? - Give him your badge.

1291
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,355
- The price was very reasonable, - Right.

1292
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:50,557
- but the meat was fresh. - It was very delicious.

1293
00:45:50,591 --> 00:45:52,926
- Which food will you try next? - I didn't even get to eat a lot.

1294
00:45:52,926 --> 00:45:54,428
- Tangsuyuk in Mok-dong. - Let's eat pork cutlet.

1295
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:55,796
- Shouldn't we eat tangsuyuk? - Did you find a place?

1296
00:45:55,796 --> 00:45:57,598
- Tangsuyuk! - It's time for tangsuyuk.

1297
00:45:57,598 --> 00:45:58,699
- Tangsuyuk. - It's cheap.

1298
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:00,367
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1299
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,803
I have to eat tangsuyuk.

1300
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:06,407
- We don't have much time left. - We're running out of time.

1301
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,375
If we don't finish on time, all of us will face the punishment.

1302
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,510
- Exactly. - That's right.

1303
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,078
It's going to be evening rush hour soon.

1304
00:46:11,078 --> 00:46:12,379
- There will be a lot of traffic. - Precisely.

1305
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:13,580
- So we must hurry. - Luckily,

1306
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,749
tangsuyuk and pork cutlet restaurants are nearby.

1307
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:18,352
I must eat tangsuyuk. Seriously. That's only fair.

1308
00:46:18,352 --> 00:46:20,254
I'll choose tangsuyuk over pork cutlet.

1309
00:46:20,254 --> 00:46:21,355
Let me have tangsuyuk.

1310
00:46:21,355 --> 00:46:22,656
Tangsuyuk must be delicious too.

1311
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:24,725
Strangely, we are only eating pork today.

1312
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,060
- That's right. - If I eat tangsuyuk...

1313
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,528
(She sounds happy.)

1314
00:46:27,528 --> 00:46:28,962
(Eat ulmyeon in sadness, eat jjajangmyeon when you're annoyed)

1315
00:46:28,962 --> 00:46:30,397
I'm annoyed, so be quiet.

1316
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:31,965
(I'm starving right now.)

1317
00:46:31,965 --> 00:46:33,300
(She stubbornly sings the song.)

1318
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,735
(Tangsuyuk)

1319
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,236
- Tangsuyuk - Tangsuyuk

1320
00:46:36,236 --> 00:46:37,371
My goodness.

1321
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,173
If I don't get to eat tangsuyuk,

1322
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:40,207
it won't be pretty then.

1323
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:42,242
I don't think you will be able to eat pork cutlet either.

1324
00:46:42,376 --> 00:46:44,445
- Jae Seok can't eat that either. - Right?

1325
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:45,813
- Hey, Se Chan. - Yes?

1326
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:48,115
Se Chan, you'd better watch your tongue.

1327
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:49,450
- It's either me or you. - Today, I'm...

1328
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,918
I'm really on the edge today.

1329
00:46:50,918 --> 00:46:54,655
I have a feeling that Jae Seok will go back on an empty stomach.

1330
00:46:54,655 --> 00:46:56,857
(Look at that joker.)

1331
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,325
This is driving me crazy.

1332
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:00,627
- Hey, we're here. - Yes, we are.

1333
00:47:01,195 --> 00:47:02,763
- We are only 400m away. - There's a college here?

1334
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,131
We are almost there.

1335
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:06,967
Besides, since we don't have much time, we must hurry.

1336
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:08,535
When we get there, we'll finish the game quickly.

1337
00:47:08,602 --> 00:47:10,304
We'll move things along really fast.

1338
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:11,839
My gosh, I can't believe we actually found this place and came.

1339
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,440
- My gosh. - That's pork cutlet!

1340
00:47:14,108 --> 00:47:15,876
- It's only two dollars! - That looks good.

1341
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,377
Goodness, let's get pork cutlet.

1342
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,780
(There's a pork cutlet restaurant next to the tangsuyuk restaurant.)

1343
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,482
Hey, the pork cutlet costs only two dollars. We'll be done then.

1344
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:22,950
(How amazing!)

1345
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,785
- It's right next to each other. - It's next to the other restaurant.

1346
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:26,019
They are next to each other.

1347
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:28,055
- We will accomplish our mission. - This is incredible.

1348
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:30,591
- This is the tangsuyuk place. - This is it.

1349
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:32,025
- Here it is. - 1 dollar and 50 cents!

1350
00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:33,360
This must be the place.

1351
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,528
Hey, a bowl of anchovy noodles is only a dollar.

1352
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:35,829
(Tangsuyuk, 1 dollar and 50 cents)

1353
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:37,731
We can walk to the next restaurant after this.

1354
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,299
They are right next to each other.

1355
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:40,534
How could this be possible?

1356
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:44,404
- Excuse me, could we film in here? - Yes.

1357
00:47:44,438 --> 00:47:45,806
- Could we film in here? - Would you be okay with that?

1358
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,374
- Is that all right with you? - Thank you.

1359
00:47:47,374 --> 00:47:48,742
All right. Thank you.

1360
00:47:48,775 --> 00:47:50,978
- Is it only 1 dollar and 50 cents? - Hello.

1361
00:47:50,978 --> 00:47:52,980
- Is that so? - We'll have some while we shoot.

1362
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,248
- We're sorry. - Thank you.

1363
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:55,816
- My gosh, this is amazing. - I see.

1364
00:47:55,816 --> 00:47:56,850
(Which members will get to eat?)

1365
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:58,118
Thank you.

1366
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,654
I'm surprised that we found this place and actually came here.

1367
00:48:02,256 --> 00:48:04,591
- "1 dollar and 50 cents"? - How could it be so cheap?

1368
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:07,427
It's crispy and savory.

1369
00:48:07,427 --> 00:48:10,631
Freshly-fried tangsuyuk costs only 1 dollar and 50 cents.

1370
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:11,765
(It's only 1 dollar and 50 cents!)

1371
00:48:11,899 --> 00:48:14,801
I'm jealous of people who live in the neighborhood.

1372
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:16,737
Students must come here often.

1373
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:19,139
It's perfect for students.

1374
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:20,674
It's not only for students.

1375
00:48:20,674 --> 00:48:22,075
(How many will enjoy tangsuyuk?)

1376
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:23,510
I hope we all get to eat it.

1377
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,946
Here's the next mission.

1378
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,948
- There are four in the kitchen. - Right.

1379
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:31,151
Ask one of them for their age.

1380
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:36,023
The number of members that corresponds to the first digit of...

1381
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,925
their age will get to eat.

1382
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:39,526
The 10th digit?

1383
00:48:39,526 --> 00:48:40,861
No, the first digit.

1384
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:43,497
- If it's 31, 1 gets to eat. - 1 person gets to eat.

1385
00:48:43,497 --> 00:48:44,598
(It depends on their age.)

1386
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:48,168
We must select someone in their late 20s or 30s.

1387
00:48:48,502 --> 00:48:50,037
We can all eat if the age is 28.

1388
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:52,739
What if it's zero like 30?

1389
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:53,807
No one gets to eat.

1390
00:48:53,807 --> 00:48:55,309
We're in trouble.

1391
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:56,910
Choose a number.

1392
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,646
We should choose the early digits.

1393
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:00,647
It's difficult.

1394
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:01,915
Pick one, Kwang Soo.

1395
00:49:01,915 --> 00:49:04,718
(Kwang Soo starts.)

1396
00:49:04,718 --> 00:49:07,087
I'll eat tangsuyuk no matter what.

1397
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:08,188
What's your number?

1398
00:49:08,355 --> 00:49:09,590
1, 2, 3.

1399
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,859
(Which number did he pick?)

1400
00:49:13,827 --> 00:49:17,998
(He gets number 8.)

1401
00:49:18,465 --> 00:49:21,101
(We knew it.)

1402
00:49:21,101 --> 00:49:22,669
He was so determined to eat.

1403
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:23,971
(Why does it always happen to me?)

1404
00:49:23,971 --> 00:49:25,505
I bet you won't get to eat.

1405
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:26,707
That's hilarious.

1406
00:49:26,707 --> 00:49:27,774
Who's next?

1407
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:29,376
I want to eat something.

1408
00:49:29,376 --> 00:49:30,611
1, 2, 3.

1409
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:31,878
(Se Chan gets 7.)

1410
00:49:31,878 --> 00:49:32,946
- 7. - 7.

1411
00:49:32,946 --> 00:49:33,947
What is it?

1412
00:49:33,947 --> 00:49:35,349
- 7. - In 2, 3.

1413
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:36,917
(So Min gets 5.)

1414
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:38,552
- Five. - Ji Hyo?

1415
00:49:38,585 --> 00:49:39,886
- 4. - She gets 4.

1416
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:41,788
I'm next. In 2, 3.

1417
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:44,258
- Mine is 6. - It's 6.

1418
00:49:44,258 --> 00:49:45,525
(Haha gets number 6.)

1419
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:46,627
- We'll get... - They're 1, 2, 3.

1420
00:49:46,627 --> 00:49:48,929
- We're 1, 2, 3. - We'll eat no matter what.

1421
00:49:48,929 --> 00:49:50,197
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1422
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:51,565
I got two.

1423
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:53,267
- Am I 1? - 3.

1424
00:49:53,267 --> 00:49:56,069
(Seok Jin is 3, Jae Seok is 2, Jong Kook is 1.)

1425
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:58,005
He doesn't even like it.

1426
00:49:58,005 --> 00:49:59,673
He doesn't even want any.

1427
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,508
I got number one.

1428
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:04,177
I was only thinking about their age.

1429
00:50:04,177 --> 00:50:05,178
I didn't care which number I would pick,

1430
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:06,446
but it turned out to be one.

1431
00:50:06,446 --> 00:50:08,382
Jong Kook is good at guessing the age.

1432
00:50:08,448 --> 00:50:10,417
Let's pick one person.

1433
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,818
If it's 28, all of us get to eat.

1434
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:14,021
I bet the owner is 28.

1435
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:16,356
- The person on the right. - They could be...

1436
00:50:16,356 --> 00:50:18,859
31 years old.

1437
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:20,961
Pick the woman in the middle.

1438
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:22,095
Let's pick the one in the middle.

1439
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,997
She seems 27 years old.

1440
00:50:23,997 --> 00:50:25,198
(She appears to be 27.)

1441
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:26,900
She's in her early 20s.

1442
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,036
- She's in her early 20s. - She's in her early or mid 20s.

1443
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:32,306
I pick the man on the left.

1444
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:36,076
(He seems to be in the late 20s or 30s.)

1445
00:50:36,443 --> 00:50:38,679
- Let's pick the one on the right. - It could be...

1446
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,280
- Could he be in his 30s? - By the way,

1447
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,249
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

1448
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:43,817
We apologize.

1449
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:46,620
Which person shall we pick?

1450
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,854
Let's pick the woman.

1451
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:49,356
The one in the middle.

1452
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:50,390
- I agree. - Me too.

1453
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,525
- Me too. - Do you want to choose?

1454
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:54,027
Based on majority vote, you choose the woman.

1455
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:55,395
(They pick the woman.)

1456
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:56,630
How old are you?

1457
00:50:57,297 --> 00:50:58,999
- Is she in her early 20s? - How old are you?

1458
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:01,868
(Tangsuyuk depends on her age.)

1459
00:51:01,868 --> 00:51:03,337
If it's 28, all of us get to eat.

1460
00:51:03,337 --> 00:51:05,172
(Tangsuyuk depends on her age.)

1461
00:51:05,172 --> 00:51:06,173
How old are you?

1462
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:08,408
(How old could she be?)

1463
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:09,676
I'm 33 years old.

1464
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:11,978
(She's in her early 30s.)

1465
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:13,213
I'm 33 years old.

1466
00:51:14,981 --> 00:51:16,817
See? She's 33.

1467
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:17,918
(Four members fail to eat.)

1468
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:19,586
She's as old as you.

1469
00:51:19,586 --> 00:51:20,787
Does Jae Seok get to eat?

1470
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:23,256
(The three get to eat.)

1471
00:51:23,256 --> 00:51:24,558
We're the first three.

1472
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:26,426
- We're the first three. - Does he get to eat?

1473
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,527
It's the three of us.

1474
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:31,031
(33 years is the best age.)

1475
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:32,466
She looks very young.

1476
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:34,568
- I thought you were in your teens. - I thought she was 26.

1477
00:51:34,568 --> 00:51:35,736
(Did you think I was in my late 20s?)

1478
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,171
What about the man on the right?

1479
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:40,040
- Pardon? - I'm 37 years old.

1480
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,009
(He's 37 years old. That was close.)

1481
00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:44,444
We should have picked him.

1482
00:51:44,444 --> 00:51:46,480
(He could have gotten his first meal.)

1483
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,714
How old are you?

1484
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:49,549
- I'm 19 years old. - 19?

1485
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:52,719
(You should have picked me.)

1486
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:54,621
- He's 19. - 19?

1487
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:56,089
- Is he 19 years old? - 19?

1488
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:57,124
- He's a senior in high school. - Who?

1489
00:51:57,124 --> 00:51:58,358
(He could have made everyone eat.)

1490
00:51:58,358 --> 00:52:00,627
He's a senior in high school.

1491
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:02,028
He's 19 years old!

1492
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:04,698
(He wasn't 33 years old!)

1493
00:52:04,698 --> 00:52:06,600
I had a chance to eat too.

1494
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,667
You picked her.

1495
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:09,035
I said to pick the man!

1496
00:52:09,102 --> 00:52:10,637
I told you that he looked young.

1497
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:12,906
I told you that he seemed young.

1498
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,541
Even I could have eaten.

1499
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:17,844
- Anyway, we get to eat. - Let's eat.

1500
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:20,447
I already have two badges.

1501
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:23,483
I had nothing to eat for hours.

1502
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:24,518
(Each of them gets a badge.)

1503
00:52:24,518 --> 00:52:25,819
For how many people is it?

1504
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:27,287
- It's for 1 person. - 1 person?

1505
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:28,588
- Is it this much? - Really?

1506
00:52:28,588 --> 00:52:29,823
It's a lot.

1507
00:52:30,257 --> 00:52:31,925
- It's freshly fried. - Right.

1508
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:33,260
- Really? - It smells amazing.

1509
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,461
The portion is generous.

1510
00:52:34,961 --> 00:52:37,364
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

1511
00:52:37,798 --> 00:52:39,399
(He takes a bite.)

1512
00:52:39,399 --> 00:52:40,834
(It only costs 1.5 dollars.)

1513
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:41,968
Is it delicious?

1514
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:43,236
It's very good.

1515
00:52:43,236 --> 00:52:46,406
- It only costs 1.5 dollars. - It's really delicious.

1516
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:49,509
(They're about to pass out.)

1517
00:52:49,509 --> 00:52:50,677
It's really delicious.

1518
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:53,447
Give me a piece.

1519
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:54,448
I gave you some.

1520
00:52:54,448 --> 00:52:55,515
I'm so tired.

1521
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:57,150
(He's desperate.)

1522
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,986
- It's because I'm tired. - Bring your dish.

1523
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:01,154
Look at my eyes.

1524
00:53:01,154 --> 00:53:02,255
(They complain about hunger.)

1525
00:53:02,255 --> 00:53:03,323
Look at Haha.

1526
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,059
(Will So Min get a bite?)

1527
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:07,194
No, it's okay.

1528
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:08,462
- It's really good. - It's okay.

1529
00:53:08,528 --> 00:53:11,331
(Did she really refuse?)

1530
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:12,466
It's okay.

1531
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:14,134
(Is she refusing a bite?)

1532
00:53:14,968 --> 00:53:20,440
(So Min loves to steal other people's food.)

1533
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,608
It's really good.

1534
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,445
- What's going on? - What's happening?

1535
00:53:25,445 --> 00:53:26,646
What's going on?

1536
00:53:26,646 --> 00:53:28,315
- What's happening? - What's going on?

1537
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:29,583
(The other table gets tangsuyuk.)

1538
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:30,717
That's not right.

1539
00:53:30,717 --> 00:53:32,752
It's because...

1540
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:33,753
(You didn't know, did you?)

1541
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,088
- The pork cutlet is... - What are you doing?

1542
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,089
What's going on?

1543
00:53:36,089 --> 00:53:37,657
You should win to eat.

1544
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:40,026
Pork cutlet costs 2.5 dollars.

1545
00:53:40,026 --> 00:53:41,428
We have enough money to eat it.

1546
00:53:41,428 --> 00:53:42,796
- What are you doing? - What's going on?

1547
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:48,401
If we spend more, imagine what will happen to you.

1548
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:50,637
(He's about to choke.)

1549
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:51,805
I'm about to choke.

1550
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:54,174
You're not some gangster.

1551
00:53:54,508 --> 00:53:56,510
I'm just informing them.

1552
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,611
(He gives him a warning.)

1553
00:53:58,645 --> 00:54:01,014
He's drinking the sauce.

1554
00:54:01,414 --> 00:54:03,717
(He's so hungry that he drinks the sauce.)

1555
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:05,852
- Hey. - It's because I'm really hungry.

1556
00:54:05,852 --> 00:54:06,887
Wait a minute.

1557
00:54:06,887 --> 00:54:09,356
- Se Chan is very hungry. - It's because I like it.

1558
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:10,457
It's delicious.

1559
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:11,558
Were you that hungry?

1560
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:13,660
Still, you shouldn't drink the sauce.

1561
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,694
It's delicious.

1562
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:16,863
- Let's eat pork cutlet. - Let's go.

1563
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:18,798
Let's go. Shall we go next door?

1564
00:54:18,798 --> 00:54:20,734
- It's right next door. - It's two dollars.

1565
00:54:20,734 --> 00:54:21,835
- Is it right next door? - Yes.

1566
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:23,236
- Thank you. - Let's go.

1567
00:54:23,236 --> 00:54:24,437
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1568
00:54:24,437 --> 00:54:25,505
(We thank the staff.)

1569
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:27,007
It's right next door.

1570
00:54:27,507 --> 00:54:29,776
- We have 2 dollars and 50 cents. - That's great.

1571
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:30,844
(They take their time.)

1572
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:33,013
Wait.

1573
00:54:34,915 --> 00:54:37,717
Is it closed?

1574
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:40,420
(We're on break.)

1575
00:54:41,388 --> 00:54:42,789
- We're in trouble. - Why?

1576
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:45,759
- It's closed. - The restaurant is closed.

1577
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:51,730
Is it closed?

1578
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:54,470
(We're on break.)

1579
00:54:55,368 --> 00:54:56,770
- We're in trouble. - Why?

1580
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,730
- It's closed. - The restaurant is closed.

1581
00:54:59,739 --> 00:55:02,000
- Why did you eat? - Wait.

1582
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,170
(This is bad news.)

1583
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,680
(The pork cutlet restaurant was next door to the tangsuyuk place.)

1584
00:55:08,114 --> 00:55:14,350
(They took their time as they were certain to clear the mission.)

1585
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,790
It's their break time.

1586
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,620
- Right now? - They're preparing.

1587
00:55:17,624 --> 00:55:20,020
Why did you eat without thinking?

1588
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,720
(They only have 2.5 dollars left.)

1589
00:55:22,729 --> 00:55:24,060
- It's because of Se Chan. - Didn't you read it?

1590
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,990
Where's the two-dollar place?

1591
00:55:25,999 --> 00:55:27,060
Find it now.

1592
00:55:27,067 --> 00:55:28,360
- Isn't it in Mokdong? - Goodness.

1593
00:55:28,368 --> 00:55:30,100
- Where was it? - Where is it?

1594
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,130
- I saw it. - This is terrible.

1595
00:55:32,138 --> 00:55:34,240
- Didn't you read it? - It's in Hongdae.

1596
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,300
Let's go to Hongdae.

1597
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:37,870
- Let's go. - Let's go to Hongdae.

1598
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:38,870
Let's hurry.

1599
00:55:38,878 --> 00:55:40,550
- There's one. - Let's just go.

1600
00:55:40,647 --> 00:55:42,980
I'll scold you in the car.

1601
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,320
Let's go.

1602
00:55:44,384 --> 00:55:46,820
- Is it 2.5 dollars? - Yes.

1603
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,150
How could you act out of whim?

1604
00:55:49,155 --> 00:55:50,920
I saw how flustered Se Chan was.

1605
00:55:50,924 --> 00:55:52,120
(They head to Hongdae.)

1606
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,260
I was so surprised.

1607
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,190
Where is it in Hongdae?

1608
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:56,220
Call the restaurant.

1609
00:55:56,229 --> 00:55:58,100
- Where is it in Hongdae? - It can't be more than 2.5 dollars.

1610
00:55:58,298 --> 00:56:00,760
We almost got in trouble.

1611
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,830
No, we're already in trouble.

1612
00:56:03,837 --> 00:56:04,930
We don't have time.

1613
00:56:04,938 --> 00:56:06,740
Turn on the light.

1614
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,900
How much time do we have?

1615
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,100
(They have 40 minutes left.)

1616
00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:10,310
How much is the place?

1617
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:11,640
- It's 2.5 dollars. - Are you sure?

1618
00:56:11,645 --> 00:56:14,180
- Yes. - If it's 50 cents more...

1619
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,340
(They fail if it's more than 2.5 dollars.)

1620
00:56:15,348 --> 00:56:17,050
If it's 2.8 or 2.9 dollars,

1621
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:18,810
- it's over. - What is it?

1622
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:21,380
- Is it more expensive? - There's a 1.9-dollar one.

1623
00:56:21,388 --> 00:56:22,780
- Where? - It's in Hongdae.

1624
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,190
Really? Let's go.

1625
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,920
- Is it in Hongdae? - Is it an old price?

1626
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,620
The blog post was written...

1627
00:56:28,628 --> 00:56:29,720
- It's this year. - It was posted...

1628
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:31,190
- No, it's last year. - in September 2017.

1629
00:56:31,197 --> 00:56:33,400
- It's served with kkakdugi. - That's great.

1630
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,630
I want some kkakdugi.

1631
00:56:34,634 --> 00:56:35,830
(They head for the pork cutlet.)

1632
00:56:36,136 --> 00:56:39,670
(They arrive at the restaurant in 25 minutes.)

1633
00:56:40,774 --> 00:56:42,500
Even noodles cost three dollars.

1634
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:43,570
(Is this the place?)

1635
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:45,310
How can pork cutlet cost 1.9 dollars?

1636
00:56:45,578 --> 00:56:47,840
- It's the main street. - It's true.

1637
00:56:47,847 --> 00:56:49,640
Is it okay to shoot?

1638
00:56:49,649 --> 00:56:51,050
Is it okay?

1639
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:53,180
Is it okay to shoot here?

1640
00:56:53,186 --> 00:56:54,580
There's fish cake soup too.

1641
00:56:54,587 --> 00:56:56,580
- We're here to eat pork cutlets. - Hello.

1642
00:56:56,589 --> 00:56:57,750
- Hello. - Hello.

1643
00:56:57,757 --> 00:56:59,050
Does your pork cutlet cost...

1644
00:56:59,059 --> 00:57:01,630
Does it really cost a dollar and 90 cents?

1645
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:05,090
The members have found pork cutlets...

1646
00:57:05,098 --> 00:57:07,730
that cost a dollar and 90 cents per portion.

1647
00:57:07,734 --> 00:57:09,860
How lucky they are.

1648
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:10,900
(They're so lucky.)

1649
00:57:10,904 --> 00:57:13,040
The owners must be out of their minds.

1650
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:14,970
Is it even possible?

1651
00:57:15,108 --> 00:57:16,600
Does it really cost only a dollar and 90 cents?

1652
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:18,070
- Do we just get pork cutlets? - Yes.

1653
00:57:18,078 --> 00:57:20,240
- That's okay. - That's okay.

1654
00:57:20,246 --> 00:57:21,910
They must get no profit.

1655
00:57:22,048 --> 00:57:23,750
Noodles cost more than pork cutlets.

1656
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,410
(Their pork cutlets cost a dollar less than the noodles.)

1657
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:29,480
Curry pork cutlet with sauce costs exactly 2 dollars and 50 cents.

1658
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:31,150
(Curry pork cutlet with sauce)

1659
00:57:31,157 --> 00:57:33,150
Guys, you have to draw a number.

1660
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:34,890
- Here we go. - Let's do this.

1661
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:38,090
If I fail this time too, I'll have starved all day.

1662
00:57:38,098 --> 00:57:41,060
Jong Kook isn't...

1663
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,430
- desperate. - I'm not.

1664
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:44,300
You shouldn't be desperate if you want to win.

1665
00:57:44,304 --> 00:57:45,900
Draw a number...

1666
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:47,510
1, 2, 3.

1667
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:49,500
- 3. - Mine must be 1.

1668
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,270
- 1, 2, 3. - Unbelievable.

1669
00:57:51,277 --> 00:57:53,170
- I can't believe it. - I picked two.

1670
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,640
1 of the 2...

1671
00:57:54,647 --> 00:57:55,940
(If they're lucky, everyone will get to eat.)

1672
00:57:55,949 --> 00:57:57,280
I'm so happy.

1673
00:57:58,118 --> 00:58:01,680
You'll roll an eight-sided dice.

1674
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:03,080
The number will determine how many can eat?

1675
00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:05,050
(They'll roll an eight-sided dice.)

1676
00:58:05,058 --> 00:58:06,550
That's correct.

1677
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,590
Ma'am, please roll the dice.

1678
00:58:08,695 --> 00:58:10,200
Are you ready?

1679
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,360
- Ready... - You can do this.

1680
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:13,390
- Please. - We want an eight.

1681
00:58:13,399 --> 00:58:15,500
Please do a good job.

1682
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:16,970
- We want an eight. - Please.

1683
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,770
Throw it high.

1684
00:58:18,905 --> 00:58:20,100
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1685
00:58:20,106 --> 00:58:24,210
(They're hungry, and some of them will be penalized soon.)

1686
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:30,450
(The owner will determine who will get pork cutlets.)

1687
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,380
- Wow, two. - Okay.

1688
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:37,960
(Only 2 people can eat.)

1689
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,360
- Okay. - Two people can eat.

1690
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,190
I haven't eaten anything.

1691
00:58:42,195 --> 00:58:44,590
- What number do you have? - I haven't eaten anything.

1692
00:58:44,597 --> 00:58:45,760
Four.

1693
00:58:45,899 --> 00:58:47,830
- My number is five. - I haven't eaten anything.

1694
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:49,230
Too bad.

1695
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:51,900
- We can order curry pork cutlets. - Okay.

1696
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:53,700
- Two curry pork cutlets? - Yes.

1697
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:54,700
- Two? - Yes.

1698
00:58:54,707 --> 00:58:57,870
We have to move to another place.

1699
00:58:57,877 --> 00:58:59,510
- Okay. - Okay.

1700
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:01,440
I haven't eaten anything.

1701
00:59:01,447 --> 00:59:02,810
Is that even possible?

1702
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:05,280
- Pork cutlets have arrived. - Thank you.

1703
00:59:05,285 --> 00:59:06,310
(They'll enjoy the pork cutlets in a park.)

1704
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,720
Thank you.

1705
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,620
Two-dollar pork cutlets.

1706
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:12,890
- They're freshly fried. - Pork cutlets.

1707
00:59:13,326 --> 00:59:14,930
- Oh, my. - Look at that.

1708
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:17,960
This costs two dollars?

1709
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:20,400
Let me try a piece first.

1710
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,430
- Okay. - Go ahead.

1711
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:22,830
Let's try it.

1712
00:59:22,836 --> 00:59:23,900
(Impressed)

1713
00:59:23,903 --> 00:59:25,930
- It looks tasty. - It's steaming.

1714
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:26,940
Does it taste like curry?

1715
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:28,770
- It tastes good. - It tastes good.

1716
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,440
- It's driving me crazy. - Can I try the sauce?

1717
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:34,940
Se Chan, come here.

1718
00:59:34,948 --> 00:59:36,810
Okay. I'll be right there.

1719
00:59:38,084 --> 00:59:39,620
- Here. - Thank you.

1720
00:59:39,919 --> 00:59:42,680
(Jong Kook shares his food with others.)

1721
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:43,990
Thank you.

1722
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:48,130
(I picked it up on the street.)

1723
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:49,590
Thank you.

1724
00:59:49,596 --> 00:59:50,760
Aren't you going to eat?

1725
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:52,260
Eat.

1726
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:56,060
The one who has accumulated the most Bad Luck Badges...

1727
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:59,330
is Se Chan.

1728
00:59:59,339 --> 01:00:04,010
He'll choose one member who will be penalized with him.

1729
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:05,270
You know what the penalty is.

1730
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:08,410
You have to take 10,000 steps in dog costumes.

1731
01:00:08,414 --> 01:00:10,650
You can only walk straight.

1732
01:00:12,018 --> 01:00:14,420
(They'll walk the crowded Hongdae street...)

1733
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,820
(in these costumes.)

1734
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:22,160
Se Chan, please put this headband on a member.

1735
01:00:22,428 --> 01:00:24,960
(This is hard.)

1736
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,690
I'll put it on from behind.

1737
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,760
(The Nevis Swing trio and Jae Seok have been excluded.)

1738
01:00:28,768 --> 01:00:30,430
I've been penalized so many times.

1739
01:00:30,436 --> 01:00:31,630
One...

1740
01:00:31,638 --> 01:00:34,000
(The candidates are Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

1741
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:35,000
Two...

1742
01:00:35,008 --> 01:00:36,610
(The candidates are Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

1743
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:42,480
(One of them will take 10,000 steps in a dog costume.)

1744
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:43,910
Three.

1745
01:00:43,917 --> 01:00:50,460
(Who will wear the costume that symbolizes the Year of the Dog?)

1746
01:00:51,524 --> 01:00:55,420
(So Min)

1747
01:00:55,428 --> 01:00:56,990
(Se Chan, you brat.)

1748
01:00:56,996 --> 01:00:58,630
Good. It's a good choice.

1749
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,460
I was hoping he'd choose So Min.

1750
01:01:01,467 --> 01:01:03,630
So Min has never done anything like this.

1751
01:01:03,636 --> 01:01:07,470
You should try wearing tights. So Min.

1752
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:10,510
I had to walk next to Kwang Soo when he was wearing a rooster costume.

1753
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,680
(It's no big deal.)

1754
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,850
That's right.

1755
01:01:14,948 --> 01:01:16,610
- Yes. - In the Year of the Rooster.

1756
01:01:16,616 --> 01:01:18,780
Our youngest members will be penalized.

1757
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:20,450
It's been decided.

1758
01:01:21,587 --> 01:01:25,450
(It even starts to snow.)

1759
01:01:25,458 --> 01:01:27,460
- It's snowing. - It's freezing.

1760
01:01:29,128 --> 01:01:31,460
(The dogs,)

1761
01:01:31,464 --> 01:01:35,770
(Se Chan, and So Min are on the street.)

1762
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:40,100
It's like "A Dog of Flanders".

1763
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,700
- You look cute. - You look great.

1764
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:43,910
I love it.

1765
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,110
I'd love to try it.

1766
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,710
Are you sure? Do you want to switch?

1767
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:50,650
- I'd love to try it. - It's freezing.

1768
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:52,210
- So Min, this is amazing. - You look great.

1769
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:53,410
It's hilarious.

1770
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:54,980
- It's snowing. - Guys.

1771
01:01:54,988 --> 01:01:56,450
We'll give you step counters.

1772
01:01:56,456 --> 01:01:59,550
If you take 5,000 steps for real, you'll have to walk 2.5km.

1773
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:01,290
- 2.5km? - So just shake your step counter...

1774
01:02:01,294 --> 01:02:03,960
while you walk until it says you've taken 5,000 steps.

1775
01:02:03,963 --> 01:02:06,060
- Shake it while you walk. - Shake your step counter.

1776
01:02:06,065 --> 01:02:08,430
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1777
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:09,760
We'll see you next week.

1778
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:10,800
See you next week.

1779
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:12,200
(We'll see you next week.)

1780
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:13,700
- Can we go home? - Bye.

1781
01:02:13,706 --> 01:02:15,700
Se Chan and So Min, bye.

1782
01:02:15,708 --> 01:02:18,480
- Bye! - Bye!

1783
01:02:19,145 --> 01:02:21,340
Se Chan, wait and see.

1784
01:02:21,347 --> 01:02:23,310
I'll get back at you.

1785
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:24,980
- I'll get back at you next week. - You look great.

1786
01:02:24,984 --> 01:02:26,010
(See you next week.)

1787
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:28,550
Bye!

1788
01:02:28,554 --> 01:02:30,920
- We have to walk 2.5km? - Yes.

1789
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,150
Guys, be careful.

1790
01:02:32,158 --> 01:02:34,060
- There you go. - Come here.

1791
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,220
- You're doing great. - Don't fight.

1792
01:02:36,229 --> 01:02:39,060
- That's my boy. - You're doing a good job.

1793
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:41,530
- That's my boy. - Look at that.

1794
01:02:41,868 --> 01:02:42,860
What's happening?

1795
01:02:42,869 --> 01:02:44,040
(People are surprised to see them.)

1796
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,630
Don't take pictures.

1797
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:46,700
(Embarrassed)

1798
01:02:46,706 --> 01:02:48,040
I'm so embarrassed.

1799
01:02:48,608 --> 01:02:50,680
Se Chan, I'm so embarrassed.

1800
01:02:51,444 --> 01:02:55,410
(They became stars on social media that day.)

1801
01:02:56,749 --> 01:02:59,220
(It's Running Man again.)

1802
01:03:00,186 --> 01:03:01,780
Hello, I'm Yang Se Hyung.

1803
01:03:01,788 --> 01:03:04,290
(Lying)

1804
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,320
- Hello, I'm Song Ji Hyo. - This is Jeon So Min.

1805
01:03:06,325 --> 01:03:09,090
I'm Song Ji Hyo. Hello.

1806
01:03:09,095 --> 01:03:10,990
(Sorry. We had no choice.)

1807
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:16,930
Why are we doing this in Hongdae on a snowy evening?

1808
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:18,270
You and me...

1809
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:21,470
(I'm sorry, So Min.)

1810
01:03:22,308 --> 01:03:25,140
So Min, we're almost done. We'll walk to Hapjeong-dong.

1811
01:03:25,144 --> 01:03:26,280
(They might walk all the way to Hapjeong-dong.)

1812
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:30,280
(They're shaking their step counters.)

1813
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:31,680
I'm done!

1814
01:03:31,684 --> 01:03:34,120
(Finally!)

1815
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,420
- You're lying. - I'm serious.

1816
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,050
I'm done.

1817
01:03:39,058 --> 01:03:40,220
Okay.

1818
01:03:40,326 --> 01:03:41,490
You're finished.

1819
01:03:41,794 --> 01:03:43,830
Both of you are finished.

1820
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,330
- You can go home now. - Let's go home!

1821
01:03:45,498 --> 01:03:47,100
Let's go. Thank you.

1822
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,530
Bye.

1823
01:03:48,534 --> 01:03:52,530
You can see it on TV at 4:50pm on Sunday. Thank you.

1824
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:55,400
(Now, "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" will be revealed.)

1825
01:03:55,408 --> 01:03:57,040
Please watch Running Man.

1826
01:03:57,276 --> 01:04:00,270
I'm so embarrassed.

1827
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:01,450
(Now, "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals" will be revealed.)

1828
01:04:02,148 --> 01:04:04,680
(The shooting starts early in the morning.)

1829
01:04:04,684 --> 01:04:06,180
It's pretty.

1830
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:08,780
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1831
01:04:08,788 --> 01:04:11,490
I see all the costumes are ready.

1832
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:14,390
I love this. It's perfect.

1833
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,200
Kwang Soo is just a giraffe?

1834
01:04:17,363 --> 01:04:18,990
I should have made him do something else.

1835
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:20,460
What a shame.

1836
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,870
I didn't pay so much attention to Kwang Soo.

1837
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:25,600
(They start preparing in the waiting room.)

1838
01:04:26,806 --> 01:04:27,840
(Other members arrive.)

1839
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,340
- What are you doing here? - Good morning.

1840
01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:31,810
- Good morning. - Is today the day?

1841
01:04:35,448 --> 01:04:37,480
Look at those costumes.

1842
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:39,650
Is there a catfish costume?

1843
01:04:41,454 --> 01:04:43,080
(Everything is set for you.)

1844
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:44,290
What is this?

1845
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,960
(The costumes have been prepared according to Jae Seok's plan.)

1846
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:50,090
- This is Seok Jin's. - Yours is here.

1847
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,690
This is mine? What am I?

1848
01:04:51,697 --> 01:04:54,860
- What are you? - What am I?

1849
01:04:54,867 --> 01:04:56,430
You look like a kid. What am I?

1850
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,100
- You look like a kid. What am I? - You're Toshio.

1851
01:05:00,106 --> 01:05:01,570
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1852
01:05:01,574 --> 01:05:03,600
- Why do you look so neat? - I won't...

1853
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:05,470
do anything.

1854
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:06,540
(Haha's role is...)

1855
01:05:06,546 --> 01:05:08,140
You'll be Toshio.

1856
01:05:08,147 --> 01:05:09,450
(Toshio)

1857
01:05:10,449 --> 01:05:14,120
(Toshio is a baby ghost from the movie, "Ju-On".)

1858
01:05:14,353 --> 01:05:15,350
What?

1859
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:16,480
(Jae Seok put a lot of thought into it.)

1860
01:05:16,489 --> 01:05:18,090
You said you wanted to be something funny.

1861
01:05:18,758 --> 01:05:20,350
You said you were tired of penguins.

1862
01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:21,520
Is this mine?

1863
01:05:21,527 --> 01:05:23,990
What? Yes. It's a catfish.

1864
01:05:23,996 --> 01:05:24,990
This doesn't look like a catfish.

1865
01:05:24,997 --> 01:05:26,590
I know. What happened?

1866
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:28,670
I'm a man.

1867
01:05:30,469 --> 01:05:33,230
(Why does a catfish need a bra?)

1868
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:35,600
Haha, good morning. Are you Toshio?

1869
01:05:35,608 --> 01:05:37,310
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1870
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,610
- Your costume is cute. - Go to the next room.

1871
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,550
Se Chan, will you be a mermaid?

1872
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:44,880
I'm supposed to be a catfish. I'm not sure.

1873
01:05:45,017 --> 01:05:47,080
Why would a catfish wear a bra?

1874
01:05:47,587 --> 01:05:49,980
Are you a female catfish?

1875
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,250
- Are you female? - Yes. I'm a female catfish.

1876
01:05:52,258 --> 01:05:53,420
(He's given up.)

1877
01:05:55,728 --> 01:05:57,990
(They have to wear costumes Jae Seok assigned to them.)

1878
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,760
It's going to be cold.

1879
01:06:00,466 --> 01:06:02,070
It looks more like a mermaid.

1880
01:06:02,168 --> 01:06:03,660
It does.

1881
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:04,840
(The silver costume looks garish.)

1882
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:08,340
I'm a man.

1883
01:06:09,709 --> 01:06:10,940
Good morning.

1884
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,370
- Seok Jin is here. - Good morning.

1885
01:06:12,378 --> 01:06:13,670
Good morning.

1886
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,140
- Seok Jin, you'll be a beggar. - What?

1887
01:06:15,147 --> 01:06:16,840
(You'll be a beggar.)

1888
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,050
- What? - You'll be a beggar.

1889
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:20,210
A beggar? Why am I a beggar?

1890
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:22,450
A beggar? Good morning.

1891
01:06:22,588 --> 01:06:25,050
- Okay. - A beggar.

1892
01:06:25,057 --> 01:06:26,250
Why am I a beggar?

1893
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:27,460
Are you a beggar?

1894
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:28,420
What is this?

1895
01:06:28,427 --> 01:06:29,830
(Why am I a beggar?)

1896
01:06:30,796 --> 01:06:33,690
(He bet all his money that Jong Kook and Ji Hyo weren't together.)

1897
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:37,700
(Many viewers said they wanted to see him broke.)

1898
01:06:37,703 --> 01:06:40,030
(Jae Seok decided to grant their wish.)

1899
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:43,600
I'm a beggar? What are you?

1900
01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:44,780
A catfish.

1901
01:06:45,077 --> 01:06:46,240
(He's no better.)

1902
01:06:46,245 --> 01:06:47,610
I'm a female catfish.

1903
01:06:47,813 --> 01:06:50,250
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1904
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:52,280
It's so noisy.

1905
01:06:52,285 --> 01:06:53,980
(Jong Kook comes in.)

1906
01:06:53,986 --> 01:06:55,080
Hello.

1907
01:06:55,087 --> 01:06:56,550
- Hello. - He's here.

1908
01:06:56,555 --> 01:06:58,920
- Jong Kook... - Your costume is a cat.

1909
01:06:58,924 --> 01:07:01,520
- I'm a cat. - It's pink.

1910
01:07:01,527 --> 01:07:03,160
- It's cute. - It is.

1911
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,760
I like cute things.

1912
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:06,360
It's cute.

1913
01:07:06,365 --> 01:07:08,100
I'm a cat.

1914
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:12,140
- I'm glad you like it. - It's cute.

1915
01:07:12,438 --> 01:07:15,600
It looks like you're shooting a finance commercial.

1916
01:07:15,608 --> 01:07:18,770
- I tried to look normal. - It's like a finance commercial.

1917
01:07:18,778 --> 01:07:20,340
You look trustworthy.

1918
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,440
(Ji Hyo arrives.)

1919
01:07:22,448 --> 01:07:23,750
What's this?

1920
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,910
No way.

1921
01:07:25,918 --> 01:07:28,190
(Goodness)

1922
01:07:28,954 --> 01:07:31,020
(This can't be.)

1923
01:07:31,023 --> 01:07:32,420
Ji Hyo, that's you.

1924
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:33,920
- Am I No-Face? - Yes, you are.

1925
01:07:33,926 --> 01:07:35,820
- I'm No-Face? - Yes.

1926
01:07:35,828 --> 01:07:37,460
- What is wrong with you? - Aren't you happy?

1927
01:07:37,463 --> 01:07:38,900
You're No-Face.

1928
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:41,260
(No-Face is a character in Japanese animation.)

1929
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,430
(It has an oval face with dark eye makeup.)

1930
01:07:43,436 --> 01:07:45,030
- You need to... - What's this?

1931
01:07:45,037 --> 01:07:47,810
do makeup like No-Face, okay?

1932
01:07:48,274 --> 01:07:50,910
You're No-Face. I thought hard...

1933
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,640
to make you look funny and settled on this.

1934
01:07:53,646 --> 01:07:55,380
- You're No-Face. - Seriously.

1935
01:07:55,548 --> 01:07:57,010
- She's No-Face. - No way.

1936
01:07:57,016 --> 01:07:58,980
I had no idea.

1937
01:08:00,086 --> 01:08:03,590
I'm a man. Why do I have to dress as a woman?

1938
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,420
- You're here. - Just do it.

1939
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:08,060
- Hey. - Just do it.

1940
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,790
(He makes everybody laugh.)

1941
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,090
What are you supposed to be?

1942
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:14,570
I'm supposed to be a catfish.

1943
01:08:15,534 --> 01:08:16,930
Why do I look like a cutlassfish?

1944
01:08:16,936 --> 01:08:19,370
You're a female catfish. Why are your shoulders so wide?

1945
01:08:19,538 --> 01:08:20,670
Hey.

1946
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:22,600
You don't need to put any makeup on.

1947
01:08:22,608 --> 01:08:23,770
You look like a catfish.

1948
01:08:23,776 --> 01:08:25,070
You do.

1949
01:08:25,077 --> 01:08:27,410
(He already looks like a catfish with his face alone.)

1950
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:30,180
- Hello. - Hello.

1951
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:31,980
- Come on over, Kwang Soo. - Hello.

1952
01:08:31,984 --> 01:08:33,280
- Hi, Haha. - Hi.

1953
01:08:33,285 --> 01:08:35,090
- Kwang Soo. - Get changed, giraffe.

1954
01:08:35,488 --> 01:08:37,220
- Kwang Soo... - What's this?

1955
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:38,850
needs some makeup too.

1956
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:40,290
That's you today.

1957
01:08:40,593 --> 01:08:42,390
- That's me? - How do I put this on?

1958
01:08:42,395 --> 01:08:43,660
Yes, it's you.

1959
01:08:43,729 --> 01:08:45,060
Hurry, Kwang Soo.

1960
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:48,830
If you don't want to do it, you can win.

1961
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:50,030
- Okay. - Sure.

1962
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:51,830
Let's play another round.

1963
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,700
- All right. - What?

1964
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:56,770
It looks good.

1965
01:08:56,776 --> 01:08:58,510
You look so scary.

1966
01:08:58,878 --> 01:09:01,110
Is this Toshio?

1967
01:09:01,514 --> 01:09:03,580
Am I just a person next to the homeless person?

1968
01:09:05,217 --> 01:09:06,520
It looks good.

1969
01:09:08,287 --> 01:09:10,920
What's this? Goodness.

1970
01:09:10,923 --> 01:09:13,290
- It's good. Good. - Where are you?

1971
01:09:13,526 --> 01:09:15,030
Let's play another round.

1972
01:09:15,428 --> 01:09:16,890
Let's play another round.

1973
01:09:16,896 --> 01:09:19,330
Just another round.

1974
01:09:19,598 --> 01:09:21,460
I'm so mad.

1975
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:23,170
(He gets up.)

1976
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:25,200
How tall am I?

1977
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,470
I'm too tall.

1978
01:09:27,473 --> 01:09:29,600
You have to put makeup on. Sit down.

1979
01:09:29,608 --> 01:09:30,910
That's so cool.

1980
01:09:31,343 --> 01:09:32,670
Let's do another round.

1981
01:09:32,678 --> 01:09:34,380
(He still wants to play another round.)

1982
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,680
Another round. I mean it. Please?

1983
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:40,010
I just remembered what I could dress Jae Seok as.

1984
01:09:40,019 --> 01:09:42,150
I can't say it now because he may not do it.

1985
01:09:42,688 --> 01:09:44,350
Let's play another round.

1986
01:09:44,356 --> 01:09:46,850
- Am I an alien? - One more time.

1987
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:48,090
I'm not a catfish.

1988
01:09:48,093 --> 01:09:50,420
- You can't. - Let's play another round.

1989
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:52,930
Why am I female?

1990
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:56,230
Why am I female? Why?

1991
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,640
What's this?

1992
01:09:58,337 --> 01:10:00,000
I have a fear of heights.

1993
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:01,170
(Shaking)

1994
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:02,810
(He's wobbly.)

1995
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:06,470
Can you catch Kwang Soo in the camera?

1996
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:07,910
You have to.

1997
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:10,340
Ji Hyo likes her No-Face costume.

1998
01:10:10,349 --> 01:10:12,280
It's a giraffe.

1999
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:13,920
I'm not a giraffe.

2000
01:10:14,286 --> 01:10:15,650
He ate it.

2001
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:18,150
Everybody is happy.

2002
01:10:18,157 --> 01:10:20,490
It looked like I was feeding a real giraffe.

2003
01:10:21,694 --> 01:10:23,820
Eat, giraffe.

2004
01:10:23,829 --> 01:10:25,230
Who told you to win?

2005
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:29,230
(It's a giraffe that eats gimbap.)

2006
01:10:29,235 --> 01:10:31,200
The giraffe almost ate my hand.

2007
01:10:33,138 --> 01:10:34,740
- Let me ask you for a favor. - What is it?

2008
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,470
Can you change the lightbulb?

2009
01:10:39,478 --> 01:10:40,710
You're going to fall.

2010
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:43,210
I'm relieved.

2011
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:44,880
They're so happy.

2012
01:10:45,484 --> 01:10:47,280
I knew they'd like it.

2013
01:10:47,286 --> 01:10:48,320
(While they have fun,)

2014
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,920
(the set is being prepared.)

2015
01:10:50,923 --> 01:10:55,290
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals", directed by Jae Seok)

2016
01:10:55,427 --> 01:11:00,500
(How will the set look?)

2017
01:11:02,868 --> 01:11:04,870
- It's because I'm wearing this. - Really?

2018
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,430
It's because of this.

2019
01:11:06,438 --> 01:11:09,400
Seok Jin is naturally funny.

2020
01:11:09,408 --> 01:11:11,810
- He's totally transformed. - The makeup was done perfectly.

2021
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,210
Thank you.

2022
01:11:14,246 --> 01:11:16,340
(He's a homeless person.)

2023
01:11:16,348 --> 01:11:17,510
What?

2024
01:11:17,516 --> 01:11:19,280
It doesn't look like you put makeup on.

2025
01:11:19,285 --> 01:11:20,810
- Gosh. - I'm serious.

2026
01:11:20,819 --> 01:11:22,380
Of course, this is my makeup.

2027
01:11:22,388 --> 01:11:23,580
Did you see what he did?

2028
01:11:23,589 --> 01:11:25,590
- "Gosh". - You punk.

2029
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:27,120
"You punk".

2030
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,690
(The trophy goes in the can.)

2031
01:11:28,694 --> 01:11:29,990
I need to find it.

2032
01:11:30,029 --> 01:11:32,100
It's Top Excellence Award.

2033
01:11:32,197 --> 01:11:33,630
Gosh.

2034
01:11:35,267 --> 01:11:37,570
Jee Seok Jin of Running Man.

2035
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:43,170
(He received the award last month.)

2036
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:46,170
(It's the irony of fate.)

2037
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,040
Why is my nose runny?

2038
01:11:48,047 --> 01:11:49,240
Do homeless people have runny noses?

2039
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:51,710
- I don't think so. - It's cold.

2040
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:53,210
Why do I have a runny nose?

2041
01:11:53,218 --> 01:11:54,550
And...

2042
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:57,320
we haven't started yet,

2043
01:11:57,323 --> 01:11:59,120
so don't run around too much. Stay still.

2044
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:02,220
- Okay? - I'm not running around.

2045
01:12:02,227 --> 01:12:04,190
- I'm staying still. - Don't run around.

2046
01:12:04,597 --> 01:12:07,300
(Fidgeting)

2047
01:12:07,933 --> 01:12:09,230
And Seok Jin.

2048
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:11,970
Stop looking for cameras. Stay still.

2049
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:14,810
My feet are frozen.

2050
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:16,300
You're a parrot.

2051
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:17,470
Thank you.

2052
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:19,540
(At that moment)

2053
01:12:23,983 --> 01:12:26,780
- You look great. - That looks great, Ji Hyo.

2054
01:12:26,919 --> 01:12:29,850
(Ta-da)

2055
01:12:29,955 --> 01:12:31,390
- Leave it that way. - Leave it.

2056
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:32,620
She looks great.

2057
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:33,920
Don't touch her.

2058
01:12:33,926 --> 01:12:35,220
It looks perfect.

2059
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:36,320
It does?

2060
01:12:36,328 --> 01:12:38,360
(She looks exactly like No-Face. The actress has transformed.)

2061
01:12:38,364 --> 01:12:39,660
Aren't you happy with it?

2062
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:42,560
It'll help you get new roles.

2063
01:12:42,568 --> 01:12:45,640
(She can act more characters now.)

2064
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:51,110
(She puts the costume on.)

2065
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:54,510
(She claps for herself.)

2066
01:12:56,248 --> 01:13:00,710
(She's put on many costumes before,)

2067
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,750
(but this one is the best.)

2068
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,750
(She comes in.)

2069
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:08,130
You scared me.

2070
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:10,230
- I was startled. - You look great, Ji Hyo.

2071
01:13:10,763 --> 01:13:12,990
- That scared me. - It's No-Face.

2072
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:14,960
- Goodness. - You really scared me.

2073
01:13:14,967 --> 01:13:16,160
(She has everybody's attention.)

2074
01:13:16,168 --> 01:13:17,400
It looks great.

2075
01:13:17,403 --> 01:13:20,230
- This is so funny. - Ji Hyo.

2076
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:21,970
Kwang Soo looks cool.

2077
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:23,970
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

2078
01:13:23,976 --> 01:13:26,540
He looks like a character from "Cats".

2079
01:13:26,545 --> 01:13:28,710
I do look cool. I like this.

2080
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:30,780
For his nose...

2081
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:32,210
Can you let...

2082
01:13:32,217 --> 01:13:33,880
- Se Chan do this? - Do this.

2083
01:13:33,886 --> 01:13:35,180
- Let him do it. - It's okay.

2084
01:13:35,187 --> 01:13:37,020
- Would you like to try? - Ma'am.

2085
01:13:37,222 --> 01:13:39,720
Don't give up on me. Please.

2086
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:41,590
Do this for the nose.

2087
01:13:41,593 --> 01:13:42,720
(Leave me to it.)

2088
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:44,260
- Is that white? - Yes.

2089
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,830
I'll do the outline.

2090
01:13:47,099 --> 01:13:50,000
- Why? Just do it. - No, this is right.

2091
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:53,300
(Let me see.)

2092
01:13:53,305 --> 01:13:56,470
(It goes like this.)

2093
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:58,470
All right. You have to do that on the nose.

2094
01:13:58,477 --> 01:14:01,110
- This is meticulous. - Right.

2095
01:14:03,615 --> 01:14:05,620
- See? It's better. - That's good.

2096
01:14:06,318 --> 01:14:07,980
You are happy about it.

2097
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:09,150
Aren't you happy it looks good?

2098
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:11,590
- This is it. - Right?

2099
01:14:12,024 --> 01:14:13,660
That's what we want.

2100
01:14:14,993 --> 01:14:19,290
(The expert and Se Chan work passionately together.)

2101
01:14:19,298 --> 01:14:22,060
(The giraffe makeup is complete.)

2102
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:23,430
Thank you.

2103
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:27,600
(He gets up.)

2104
01:14:31,443 --> 01:14:33,640
(Sighing)

2105
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:38,810
(He puts the giraffe head on.)

2106
01:14:38,817 --> 01:14:41,010
You've never been a giraffe to this level, right?

2107
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,050
You're a perfect giraffe.

2108
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:46,050
- He looks great. - You never did it to this level.

2109
01:14:46,058 --> 01:14:47,450
He thinks Kwang Soo looks great.

2110
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:48,620
(He looks biologically giraffe.)

2111
01:14:48,627 --> 01:14:50,420
Can you do it up to here?

2112
01:14:50,429 --> 01:14:51,760
Let's take a picture.

2113
01:14:53,866 --> 01:14:55,470
How am I supposed to do this?

2114
01:14:55,634 --> 01:14:56,960
You're not in the screen.

2115
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:59,200
- I can't do anything else. - Hold on.

2116
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:00,800
- Wait. - I can't do this.

2117
01:15:00,806 --> 01:15:02,040
I'm coming down.

2118
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,340
Come down.

2119
01:15:03,375 --> 01:15:04,640
Let's take...

2120
01:15:04,643 --> 01:15:06,740
(Collapsing)

2121
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,210
Are you all right?

2122
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:10,510
(It's dangerous to stand on two feet.)

2123
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:12,310
Are you okay? Be careful.

2124
01:15:12,317 --> 01:15:13,980
Be careful.

2125
01:15:13,986 --> 01:15:16,280
Be careful, Kwang Soo. Are you okay?

2126
01:15:16,288 --> 01:15:17,750
I just bungee jumped.

2127
01:15:17,856 --> 01:15:19,220
That was so scary.

2128
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:20,820
(He's petrified.)

2129
01:15:20,826 --> 01:15:22,720
Who did that?

2130
01:15:22,728 --> 01:15:24,360
Don't take pictures.

2131
01:15:24,463 --> 01:15:25,890
Don't try to take pictures.

2132
01:15:25,898 --> 01:15:27,290
I wanted to commemorate...

2133
01:15:27,299 --> 01:15:28,900
My phone is broken.

2134
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:30,600
- Is it okay? - It's broken.

2135
01:15:30,602 --> 01:15:32,100
Why did you do this?

2136
01:15:32,104 --> 01:15:34,070
- Is it okay? - This is all I had, and it's gone.

2137
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,200
- Goodness. - Is it okay?

2138
01:15:35,207 --> 01:15:37,670
- I lost everything. - Seok Jin.

2139
01:15:37,709 --> 01:15:39,370
- His phone is broken. - It is.

2140
01:15:39,378 --> 01:15:40,780
It won't work.

2141
01:15:42,047 --> 01:15:48,090
(So Min, the parrot, shows up.)

2142
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:56,060
(She's an angry parrot.)

2143
01:15:57,029 --> 01:15:58,400
I'm angry.

2144
01:15:58,897 --> 01:16:00,130
I'm angry.

2145
01:16:01,133 --> 01:16:02,500
It looks great.

2146
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:04,600
- I like the parrot. - She's a parrot.

2147
01:16:05,404 --> 01:16:06,530
Look at the giraffe.

2148
01:16:06,538 --> 01:16:08,610
Are you a giraffe or a lion? What are you?

2149
01:16:08,807 --> 01:16:10,170
- He's a giraffe. - How could you?

2150
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:11,810
- I can knock you out. - How is he a lion?

2151
01:16:11,810 --> 01:16:13,170
(This looks like "Fantastic Beasts".)

2152
01:16:13,178 --> 01:16:15,180
- You look like a duck. - She's a parrot.

2153
01:16:18,817 --> 01:16:20,810
(The angry parrot terrorizes the giraffe.)

2154
01:16:20,819 --> 01:16:22,390
Stop it.

2155
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:24,520
She kicked him.

2156
01:16:24,523 --> 01:16:25,950
Stop it.

2157
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,720
(He can't move by himself.)

2158
01:16:27,726 --> 01:16:29,820
I can't move.

2159
01:16:29,828 --> 01:16:32,060
(I was born human.)

2160
01:16:32,064 --> 01:16:33,790
What's this? What did I do?

2161
01:16:33,799 --> 01:16:36,600
(Who is this giraffe in the mirror?)

2162
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:40,240
- Put your shoes on, Jong Kook. - I have shoes?

2163
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,500
I'm sorry, but I wasn't trying to make you look cute.

2164
01:16:42,507 --> 01:16:43,840
I'm so cute.

2165
01:16:44,042 --> 01:16:45,210
I love this.

2166
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:47,570
- Gosh... - He loves it.

2167
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:50,610
(He's supposed to be a cat, but he looks like Tiger Mask.)

2168
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:53,880
(The members are ready to go.)

2169
01:16:53,886 --> 01:16:56,380
I think we are all ready. Let's get moving.

2170
01:16:56,388 --> 01:16:57,550
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go to the set.

2171
01:16:57,556 --> 01:16:58,550
Let's finish this fast.

2172
01:16:58,557 --> 01:17:00,150
- Hold onto him. Stop eating. - Seok Jin.

2173
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,660
You have to hold him. He can't walk on his own.

2174
01:17:04,396 --> 01:17:06,460
You've never been a giraffe to this level, right?

2175
01:17:06,465 --> 01:17:07,630
(Kwang Soo is a perfect giraffe today.)

2176
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:11,500
She's a parrot on a roost.

2177
01:17:12,437 --> 01:17:13,530
(Jong Kook is a muscular cat.)

2178
01:17:13,538 --> 01:17:16,240
He can be a cat on top of a fireplace.

2179
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:19,770
Seok Jin needs to hold an empty can.

2180
01:17:19,778 --> 01:17:21,240
(Se Chan is a catfish, and Seok Jin is a beggar.)

2181
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,210
(Ji Hyo is No-Face, and Haha is Toshio.)

2182
01:17:23,215 --> 01:17:24,980
No-Face looks great.

2183
01:17:25,217 --> 01:17:29,450
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

2184
01:17:30,389 --> 01:17:32,950
- This is yours. - I caught a cat.

2185
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:34,220
(They're in the studio.)

2186
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:37,830
What's that?

2187
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:41,330
It looks like we're doing a performance.

2188
01:17:41,566 --> 01:17:43,560
This looks like a performance.

2189
01:17:43,568 --> 01:17:45,100
Who does this for a TV rating notice?

2190
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,470
Who does a TV rating notice like this?

2191
01:17:49,174 --> 01:17:51,970
Why is one shoulder lower than the other?

2192
01:17:51,977 --> 01:17:53,040
Haha is a bit taller.

2193
01:17:53,045 --> 01:17:54,070
(My crutches are of different heights.)

2194
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:55,240
It's high.

2195
01:17:55,247 --> 01:17:56,510
Everybody.

2196
01:17:56,515 --> 01:17:58,050
(He's the main guy today.)

2197
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,180
So Min, go on the roost.

2198
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:01,950
You are the only one who looks nice.

2199
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,250
(She fits in 200 percent.)

2200
01:18:04,256 --> 01:18:06,550
So Min.

2201
01:18:06,558 --> 01:18:08,660
You look like a real bird.

2202
01:18:08,827 --> 01:18:09,920
That's so funny.

2203
01:18:09,928 --> 01:18:11,990
I'll put you into places.

2204
01:18:11,997 --> 01:18:13,060
(I'm a real bird.)

2205
01:18:13,065 --> 01:18:15,760
The giraffe goes at the back.

2206
01:18:15,767 --> 01:18:16,930
Where?

2207
01:18:17,836 --> 01:18:18,930
Move over.

2208
01:18:18,937 --> 01:18:22,900
(He's slow.)

2209
01:18:22,908 --> 01:18:25,010
(He's a sad animal with a long torso.)

2210
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,740
- In front of that? - That's good.

2211
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,940
- Turn around. - Stop going. Turn.

2212
01:18:29,948 --> 01:18:33,220
(He takes forever.)

2213
01:18:33,318 --> 01:18:35,780
- And the cat... - Okay.

2214
01:18:35,787 --> 01:18:37,080
is next to the parrot.

2215
01:18:37,089 --> 01:18:38,790
- Go next to the parrot. - Here?

2216
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:39,950
- Here? - Yes.

2217
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,320
That's a good seat.

2218
01:18:41,326 --> 01:18:43,690
It's good. I'm in the middle.

2219
01:18:43,962 --> 01:18:46,990
Move. Go away.

2220
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:48,370
She's too into her role.

2221
01:18:50,035 --> 01:18:51,170
Let me see.

2222
01:18:52,004 --> 01:18:53,870
(He's not into his character yet.)

2223
01:18:53,872 --> 01:18:55,670
(She isn't either.)

2224
01:18:55,674 --> 01:18:57,870
(He isn't.)

2225
01:18:59,077 --> 01:19:01,910
You have to lie down.

2226
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:05,420
You have to lie down. You're a catfish.

2227
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,550
- Am I really a catfish? - Yes.

2228
01:19:08,387 --> 01:19:09,450
(He keeps on having identity issues.)

2229
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:10,680
- Your costume... - You can't see me.

2230
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:12,490
wasn't ready.

2231
01:19:14,192 --> 01:19:17,890
Shouldn't the giraffe go in between those two?

2232
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:19,990
- Where? - Next to the parrot.

2233
01:19:19,998 --> 01:19:21,260
(That's the spot.)

2234
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,900
(They help him.)

2235
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:28,940
(It requires a few people to move him.)

2236
01:19:30,008 --> 01:19:31,810
We can do this in five seconds?

2237
01:19:32,944 --> 01:19:35,150
Are there too many people on this side?

2238
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,640
Yes, there are.

2239
01:19:36,648 --> 01:19:40,220
- Let's go back then. - Jae Seok.

2240
01:19:40,752 --> 01:19:41,820
Stop moving me around.

2241
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,380
There are too many people here.

2242
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:44,820
It's not an easy thing to do.

2243
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:49,260
The beggar has cookies in his can.

2244
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:52,160
(Goodness)

2245
01:19:52,964 --> 01:19:54,030
- Take it out. - Why?

2246
01:19:54,032 --> 01:19:55,060
Stop eating.

2247
01:19:55,067 --> 01:19:56,760
- Why do you want to take it out? - What are you doing?

2248
01:19:56,768 --> 01:19:58,200
- Hey. - Stop eating.

2249
01:19:58,203 --> 01:19:59,440
My trophy.

2250
01:20:00,138 --> 01:20:02,370
- Bring it back. - He put cookies in here.

2251
01:20:02,374 --> 01:20:05,180
- Hey. - It has to be realistic.

2252
01:20:05,444 --> 01:20:08,110
You have to be hungry. Why did you put cookies in there?

2253
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:09,340
My gosh.

2254
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:10,550
(Don't ruin the atmosphere. Stay still, homeless man.)

2255
01:20:11,316 --> 01:20:13,610
This is good. You two look so cute.

2256
01:20:13,618 --> 01:20:15,580
(Toshio and No-Face)

2257
01:20:15,587 --> 01:20:16,580
(Are we doing this right?)

2258
01:20:16,588 --> 01:20:17,890
You guys are so cute.

2259
01:20:18,023 --> 01:20:19,350
- What about me? - What?

2260
01:20:19,357 --> 01:20:21,250
- What about me? - Stay still.

2261
01:20:21,259 --> 01:20:23,060
(This is so sad.)

2262
01:20:23,695 --> 01:20:26,130
Jong Kook looks like Ahn Moon Suk.

2263
01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:29,630
He looks like her from the side.

2264
01:20:29,634 --> 01:20:31,430
(Who's Ahn Moon Suk from these two?)

2265
01:20:31,636 --> 01:20:34,230
Cat, come here please.

2266
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:35,240
Where?

2267
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,100
The beggar...

2268
01:20:37,109 --> 01:20:39,770
- is your owner. - I am his?

2269
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:42,480
(The beggar is your owner.)

2270
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:44,080
- Okay. - Lie down.

2271
01:20:44,082 --> 01:20:46,580
(I am...)

2272
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:49,020
(the cute cat.)

2273
01:20:49,287 --> 01:20:51,560
- Good job. - You met a bad owner.

2274
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,720
Seok Jin is pretending to pat Jong Kook's head.

2275
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:55,990
He's not really touching him.

2276
01:20:56,094 --> 01:20:57,490
He's pretending.

2277
01:20:57,496 --> 01:20:58,560
(I can't touch this cat.)

2278
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:01,130
Then I'll come in.

2279
01:21:01,266 --> 01:21:03,260
I'll stand here. It's here.

2280
01:21:03,268 --> 01:21:05,670
(He wants the camera on him.)

2281
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:08,240
- Let's not move around. - Sorry?

2282
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,600
Give us some lines.

2283
01:21:09,608 --> 01:21:12,240
- What lines? - Let us say the age 12 part.

2284
01:21:12,444 --> 01:21:13,570
Okay. I'll give you a line.

2285
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:15,550
We can say, "12 years and older".

2286
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:17,140
You can make a squawking sound.

2287
01:21:17,149 --> 01:21:18,350
Like this?

2288
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,680
Say, "rated".

2289
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:21,920
- Rated. - "Rated 12 years and older".

2290
01:21:21,953 --> 01:21:23,750
Rated. Okay?

2291
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:25,320
I'll come to the middle.

2292
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:27,890
Running Man is...

2293
01:21:27,893 --> 01:21:28,960
- Rated... - Rated...

2294
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,420
12 years and older.

2295
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:32,600
Be louder.

2296
01:21:32,664 --> 01:21:35,000
12 years and older.

2297
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,330
12 years and older.

2298
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:39,930
- 12 years and older. - 12 years and older.

2299
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:41,470
Stop it.

2300
01:21:41,706 --> 01:21:42,800
Do your job.

2301
01:21:42,807 --> 01:21:44,370
I was teaching her.

2302
01:21:44,376 --> 01:21:46,970
- 12 years and older. - 12 years and older.

2303
01:21:46,978 --> 01:21:49,110
12 years and older. Rated 12 years and older.

2304
01:21:49,114 --> 01:21:50,440
12 years and older.

2305
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:51,480
(I can do it too.)

2306
01:21:51,483 --> 01:21:52,650
Stop it.

2307
01:21:53,518 --> 01:21:56,050
- Why are you holding the trophy? - Right?

2308
01:21:56,054 --> 01:21:57,650
Why is his trophy there?

2309
01:21:57,722 --> 01:22:00,560
It's honoring his past.

2310
01:22:00,692 --> 01:22:01,960
Okay?

2311
01:22:02,093 --> 01:22:03,960
Jong Kook, can you go on your knees?

2312
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:06,500
- I can't see your face. Do this. - Okay.

2313
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,160
Lick your hands.

2314
01:22:08,233 --> 01:22:10,470
(I'm an obedient cat.)

2315
01:22:10,769 --> 01:22:11,940
You two are great.

2316
01:22:12,003 --> 01:22:14,300
Toshio and No-Face are good.

2317
01:22:14,306 --> 01:22:15,370
- What about me? - The giraffe.

2318
01:22:15,373 --> 01:22:18,210
You have to make some noise. Do this with your tongue.

2319
01:22:18,677 --> 01:22:20,710
Right.

2320
01:22:20,712 --> 01:22:21,710
(Like this?)

2321
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:23,510
- Do this. - Do I say something?

2322
01:22:23,515 --> 01:22:25,010
No, don't do that.

2323
01:22:25,016 --> 01:22:26,710
Stick your tongue out, and act.

2324
01:22:26,718 --> 01:22:27,980
(This is good acting.)

2325
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:30,020
I won't come to the center.

2326
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:33,220
I own this beggar.

2327
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,120
I own this beggar.

2328
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:37,320
- That looks so scary. - Wait.

2329
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:39,190
I feel sorry for that beggar.

2330
01:22:39,197 --> 01:22:41,290
- What's wrong? - What?

2331
01:22:41,299 --> 01:22:42,860
Why can't a cat raise a person?

2332
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:43,900
- Lie on his lap. - Me?

2333
01:22:43,902 --> 01:22:45,040
Yes.

2334
01:22:45,203 --> 01:22:47,900
Repeat after Jae Seok.

2335
01:22:48,306 --> 01:22:50,170
Say, "Running Man is".

2336
01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:51,570
I'll copy him.

2337
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,640
While you guys are here,

2338
01:22:54,646 --> 01:22:56,440
I'll come in.

2339
01:22:56,448 --> 01:22:58,010
Do you have to look so gentle?

2340
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:02,050
- Running Man is... - Running Man is...

2341
01:23:02,053 --> 01:23:03,280
No.

2342
01:23:03,288 --> 01:23:04,380
Running Man is...

2343
01:23:04,389 --> 01:23:05,520
- Rated... - Rated 12 years and older.

2344
01:23:05,523 --> 01:23:07,020
12 years and older. Got it?

2345
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:09,090
She's copying you because she's a parrot.

2346
01:23:09,094 --> 01:23:12,100
It's not funny.

2347
01:23:12,397 --> 01:23:15,430
Sir, you can do that when you're the director.

2348
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:17,460
Let's do this again.

2349
01:23:17,469 --> 01:23:18,830
Let's do it again.

2350
01:23:18,837 --> 01:23:20,070
I'm so mad!

2351
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:22,100
What if I win again?

2352
01:23:22,107 --> 01:23:23,200
My gosh.

2353
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,270
Keep doing that, So Min.

2354
01:23:25,277 --> 01:23:26,770
Keep doing that.

2355
01:23:26,778 --> 01:23:29,210
Let's practice. This is the last time.

2356
01:23:29,614 --> 01:23:30,750
Ready.

2357
01:23:32,517 --> 01:23:34,480
- It's good. - Let's go.

2358
01:23:34,653 --> 01:23:37,350
(They've practiced.)

2359
01:23:37,355 --> 01:23:38,820
(They're absorbed in their roles.)

2360
01:23:38,823 --> 01:23:42,420
(Let's show our great acting skills.)

2361
01:23:42,427 --> 01:23:45,060
- Sorry. I need to use the bathroom. - Jae Seok.

2362
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:47,630
(Excuse me.)

2363
01:23:47,632 --> 01:23:48,900
Jae Seok.

2364
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,860
Why do you need to use the bathroom?

2365
01:23:49,868 --> 01:23:51,100
I'll be back.

2366
01:23:51,636 --> 01:23:52,970
Why all of a sudden?

2367
01:23:53,338 --> 01:23:54,740
Does he have a mission to complete?

2368
01:23:54,839 --> 01:23:56,270
Is this a mission or something?

2369
01:23:57,742 --> 01:23:59,380
I'm getting dizzy.

2370
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:03,710
(Chuckling)

2371
01:24:03,715 --> 01:24:08,490
(She's satisfied with how she looks.)

2372
01:24:09,688 --> 01:24:11,520
- This looks good. - We can't get...

2373
01:24:11,523 --> 01:24:12,520
solo shots, right?

2374
01:24:12,524 --> 01:24:13,550
You have a good spot.

2375
01:24:13,558 --> 01:24:15,420
- We're in the background, right? - Yes.

2376
01:24:15,427 --> 01:24:16,790
- Running Man is... - Hey.

2377
01:24:16,795 --> 01:24:19,690
When Jae Seok says his line, let's jump in.

2378
01:24:19,698 --> 01:24:22,830
You can't do that.

2379
01:24:25,303 --> 01:24:28,540
It won't take long. Let's go in one try.

2380
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:30,710
Let's do it twice and pick the better one.

2381
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:34,280
Let's practice. Let's go.

2382
01:24:34,312 --> 01:24:35,610
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2383
01:24:35,814 --> 01:24:36,980
Let's go.

2384
01:24:39,517 --> 01:24:40,810
Running Man is...

2385
01:24:40,819 --> 01:24:41,920
- Rated... - Rated...

2386
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,260
12 years and older. Jae Seok is stupid.

2387
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:47,820
(Jae Seok is stupid.)

2388
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:49,730
Don't do that.

2389
01:24:50,228 --> 01:24:51,520
- Don't do that. - That was good.

2390
01:24:51,529 --> 01:24:52,800
Hey, don't do that.

2391
01:24:52,997 --> 01:24:54,360
You call that improvisation?

2392
01:24:54,366 --> 01:24:55,670
She's a drunk parrot.

2393
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,070
Let's go twice.

2394
01:24:59,137 --> 01:25:02,140
Flap your wings as if you're flying.

2395
01:25:02,807 --> 01:25:05,570
You have a big role, So Min. I'm jealous.

2396
01:25:05,577 --> 01:25:07,310
- You get to flap your wings. - She's the main character.

2397
01:25:07,312 --> 01:25:08,980
I have a big role.

2398
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,240
Jong Kook, lick your hand.

2399
01:25:11,249 --> 01:25:12,880
You're sticking your tongue out, right?

2400
01:25:12,884 --> 01:25:14,650
No-Face and Toshio.

2401
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:15,790
- I'm doing it. - Good.

2402
01:25:16,688 --> 01:25:19,190
And... Hey.

2403
01:25:19,524 --> 01:25:20,760
(What?)

2404
01:25:21,559 --> 01:25:23,420
Why are you playing the lobster?

2405
01:25:23,428 --> 01:25:25,090
I have to do something.

2406
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,330
This is a lonely spot.

2407
01:25:27,465 --> 01:25:30,230
- I don't know what you are. - Me neither.

2408
01:25:30,235 --> 01:25:32,500
- Are you a catfish or a mermaid? - I don't know.

2409
01:25:32,504 --> 01:25:33,840
You're an alien.

2410
01:25:33,872 --> 01:25:35,070
Let's go.

2411
01:25:35,173 --> 01:25:36,300
I should play this.

2412
01:25:36,307 --> 01:25:37,870
- Let's go. - You'll make noise.

2413
01:25:37,876 --> 01:25:39,670
Don't play that.

2414
01:25:39,677 --> 01:25:42,140
- You'll make noise. Stay still. - Let me do it.

2415
01:25:42,147 --> 01:25:43,880
- Stay still. - Goodness.

2416
01:25:43,882 --> 01:25:45,580
Do what I tell you to do.

2417
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,610
Why do you have so many ambitions?

2418
01:25:47,619 --> 01:25:49,350
I thought I was supposed to hit this.

2419
01:25:49,354 --> 01:25:51,380
- I'm sorry. - Put it down.

2420
01:25:51,389 --> 01:25:52,920
Don't do it.

2421
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:58,560
(While the three members argue,)

2422
01:25:58,563 --> 01:26:00,090
(they are forgotten.)

2423
01:26:00,098 --> 01:26:01,300
Seok Jin.

2424
01:26:04,068 --> 01:26:06,300
- Put it down. - Don't do it.

2425
01:26:06,938 --> 01:26:08,540
You scumbag of a beggar!

2426
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,210
- Stop it. - I'm sorry.

2427
01:26:11,376 --> 01:26:13,370
- Finish it. - Stop it.

2428
01:26:13,378 --> 01:26:14,640
Hurry.

2429
01:26:15,246 --> 01:26:16,710
Why are you hitting me?

2430
01:26:16,714 --> 01:26:18,850
(Too much greed makes the other members mad.)

2431
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,980
- Why do I have this then? - Don't be greedy.

2432
01:26:20,985 --> 01:26:22,550
- Fine. - Don't be greedy.

2433
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:24,580
- This is a TV rating notice. - Put it down.

2434
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:26,960
Viewers don't expect anything from you,

2435
01:26:27,325 --> 01:26:29,160
- so don't do it. - It's mine.

2436
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,430
Don't do it. Put this inside.

2437
01:26:31,996 --> 01:26:34,260
This is symbolic. Leave it alone.

2438
01:26:34,265 --> 01:26:36,030
- Go. - Leave it inside.

2439
01:26:36,034 --> 01:26:37,060
It's mine!

2440
01:26:37,068 --> 01:26:39,300
- That stupid beggar. - Hurry up.

2441
01:26:39,304 --> 01:26:42,000
- Get out. Come here. - Hurry.

2442
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:43,000
(They wrestle with each other.)

2443
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:44,840
- Don't do it. - Kick him out.

2444
01:26:45,143 --> 01:26:46,270
Get out.

2445
01:26:46,277 --> 01:26:47,340
- Don't do it. - Kick him out.

2446
01:26:47,345 --> 01:26:49,040
- Fine. - Do as you are told.

2447
01:26:49,047 --> 01:26:50,410
- Spray salt on him. - Gosh.

2448
01:26:50,415 --> 01:26:52,850
- What are you doing? - He's a tyrant.

2449
01:26:53,017 --> 01:26:54,610
Do as you are told, everybody.

2450
01:26:54,619 --> 01:26:56,120
That's the only way we will get done quickly.

2451
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,580
- Let's do two takes. - Okay.

2452
01:26:57,589 --> 01:26:59,220
Here we go. Cue.

2453
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:00,760
(They calm down.)

2454
01:27:02,827 --> 01:27:03,820
Running Man is...

2455
01:27:03,828 --> 01:27:05,160
- Rated... - Rated...

2456
01:27:05,163 --> 01:27:08,290
12 years and older.

2457
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:10,160
You blocked out the words.

2458
01:27:10,168 --> 01:27:11,500
His timing was off, too.

2459
01:27:11,503 --> 01:27:16,800
- You blocked out my voice. - He said the words a bit late.

2460
01:27:16,808 --> 01:27:18,300
This is a festival.

2461
01:27:18,309 --> 01:27:21,240
- Festival, my foot! - It's a festival.

2462
01:27:21,246 --> 01:27:23,040
The audio...

2463
01:27:23,047 --> 01:27:24,780
(Kicking)

2464
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:26,610
You blocked out the audio.

2465
01:27:26,618 --> 01:27:27,950
No-Face is angry.

2466
01:27:27,952 --> 01:27:29,220
No-Face, are you okay?

2467
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,450
Do it right.

2468
01:27:30,455 --> 01:27:31,680
All right.

2469
01:27:31,689 --> 01:27:34,690
You blocked out So Min's voice.

2470
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:38,060
Don't beat the empty can. Take it from him.

2471
01:27:38,062 --> 01:27:39,200
Hey.

2472
01:27:40,632 --> 01:27:42,700
- Why are you coming this way? - He is exhausted.

2473
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:43,830
(Kicking)

2474
01:27:44,636 --> 01:27:45,630
Hey.

2475
01:27:45,637 --> 01:27:46,630
(Kicking)

2476
01:27:46,638 --> 01:27:48,300
What do you think you are doing?

2477
01:27:48,773 --> 01:27:50,810
- Seok Jin. - All right. All right.

2478
01:27:50,909 --> 01:27:52,970
I want to get off this thing.

2479
01:27:52,977 --> 01:27:54,380
All right. I won't beat the empty can.

2480
01:27:54,512 --> 01:27:56,310
I am feeling dizzy.

2481
01:27:57,215 --> 01:27:59,150
I need some anxiety-relieving pills.

2482
01:28:00,018 --> 01:28:02,250
It's a festival. I did it because it's a festival.

2483
01:28:02,987 --> 01:28:04,490
This will be our last take.

2484
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:08,050
I am not the type to shoot for long. I work quickly.

2485
01:28:08,059 --> 01:28:09,430
- Okay. - We only need five seconds.

2486
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:12,360
- It's shaped like a heart. - Stop it.

2487
01:28:13,498 --> 01:28:15,800
Let's go. Position your hands.

2488
01:28:16,968 --> 01:28:18,800
- Let's go. - Your hair is flying in the air.

2489
01:28:19,203 --> 01:28:20,630
I can't make you go flying in the air.

2490
01:28:20,638 --> 01:28:23,300
(What can I do?)

2491
01:28:23,308 --> 01:28:25,510
(I guess you are right.)

2492
01:28:25,877 --> 01:28:28,710
Focus. This is the last take.

2493
01:28:29,047 --> 01:28:31,180
(For the last time, action.)

2494
01:28:31,683 --> 01:28:32,780
Running Man is...

2495
01:28:32,784 --> 01:28:33,880
- Rated... - Rated...

2496
01:28:33,885 --> 01:28:37,990
12 years and older. Jae Seok is an utter jerk!

2497
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:40,420
- So Min! - What are you doing?

2498
01:28:40,425 --> 01:28:41,890
You utter jerk!

2499
01:28:42,427 --> 01:28:44,490
Can't you do it right?

2500
01:28:44,495 --> 01:28:46,090
Hey!

2501
01:28:46,097 --> 01:28:47,630
(There goes what was supposed to be our last take.)

2502
01:28:47,632 --> 01:28:49,760
- What are you doing? - I got so angry.

2503
01:28:49,767 --> 01:28:50,960
I was too angry.

2504
01:28:50,969 --> 01:28:52,940
This is a TV rating notice for 12 years and older.

2505
01:28:53,004 --> 01:28:54,870
What exactly is our problem?

2506
01:28:54,872 --> 01:28:56,370
Why can't we finish it?

2507
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:58,540
Let me take off my shoes!

2508
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,610
I feel nauseous.

2509
01:29:01,779 --> 01:29:04,680
Focus. This is the last take.

2510
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:08,120
Let's focus. This isn't hard.

2511
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:10,680
Your greed is making this hard.

2512
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:12,320
Why do you keep messing it up...

2513
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,790
when there is only one line?

2514
01:29:15,126 --> 01:29:17,260
Look at us siblings from Mapo-gu.

2515
01:29:17,261 --> 01:29:19,200
- You are doing well. - We don't try anything.

2516
01:29:19,964 --> 01:29:22,630
- Your greed is making this hard. - Stop being greedy.

2517
01:29:22,634 --> 01:29:24,160
Why are you so greedy?

2518
01:29:24,168 --> 01:29:26,540
Squash the greed that bubbles up in your heart.

2519
01:29:26,838 --> 01:29:28,940
All of us need to do our part.

2520
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,400
Put it down.

2521
01:29:30,408 --> 01:29:32,910
- What? - Put the lobster down.

2522
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,810
This is the last piece of my pride.

2523
01:29:35,313 --> 01:29:36,940
I need this for my pride.

2524
01:29:36,948 --> 01:29:37,980
All right.

2525
01:29:37,982 --> 01:29:39,620
It's okay to hold a lobster.

2526
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:41,120
Let's go.

2527
01:29:42,353 --> 01:29:45,520
This is the last take. You need to do your parts well.

2528
01:29:45,523 --> 01:29:48,220
(With the hope that this'll be the last take, action.)

2529
01:29:48,359 --> 01:29:49,490
Running Man is...

2530
01:29:49,494 --> 01:29:50,520
- Rated... - Rated...

2531
01:29:50,528 --> 01:29:54,500
12 years and older. 12 years and older.

2532
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:56,530
Why does it sound like she's swearing?

2533
01:29:56,534 --> 01:29:58,800
(Did she just swear?)

2534
01:29:58,803 --> 01:30:00,770
Hold on. Don't repeat it like that.

2535
01:30:00,772 --> 01:30:03,770
- Don't do it. - Don't do it.

2536
01:30:04,709 --> 01:30:06,070
It really sounds a bit...

2537
01:30:06,077 --> 01:30:07,710
It sounds like a swear word.

2538
01:30:07,712 --> 01:30:10,240
Let's wrap it up. I think we are getting there.

2539
01:30:10,248 --> 01:30:12,180
- You are doing well, right? - Yes.

2540
01:30:12,583 --> 01:30:14,110
Let's go.

2541
01:30:14,118 --> 01:30:17,050
No matter how it goes, this will be our last take.

2542
01:30:17,055 --> 01:30:18,220
- Okay. - Okay.

2543
01:30:18,289 --> 01:30:19,290
Let's go.

2544
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,150
(The production crew is out of tape.)

2545
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:22,320
It will air for a month.

2546
01:30:22,326 --> 01:30:23,890
(This time, it's the real one.)

2547
01:30:24,629 --> 01:30:28,360
No matter how it goes, this will be our last take.

2548
01:30:28,366 --> 01:30:29,530
Okay.

2549
01:30:30,368 --> 01:30:31,400
Cue.

2550
01:30:31,402 --> 01:30:33,000
(Let go of your greed.)

2551
01:30:33,237 --> 01:30:35,270
(For the very last time, action.)

2552
01:30:35,273 --> 01:30:36,410
Running Man is...

2553
01:30:37,108 --> 01:30:41,770
(We reveal the finished version of "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".)

2554
01:30:41,779 --> 01:30:43,010
("Yu Jae Seok and the Animals")

2555
01:30:44,415 --> 01:30:45,610
(You will see this TV rating notice starting from next week.)

2556
01:30:45,616 --> 01:30:47,510
- Running Man is... - Rated...

2557
01:30:47,518 --> 01:30:51,990
12 years and older. Jae Seok is stupid.

2558
01:30:53,057 --> 01:30:54,590
My goodness.

2559
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:56,430
(Embezzlers, Jae Seok and So Min)

2560
01:30:56,794 --> 01:30:58,890

(Se Chan and Seok Jin)

2564
01:31:04,135 --> 01:31:05,500
(I am 203cm tall.)

2565
01:31:06,104 --> 01:31:07,770
(The swindlers,)

2566
01:31:07,772 --> 01:31:09,540

2568
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:15,640
(Prison?)

2569

(They will become new people after 8 years.)

2570
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:21,350
(Welcome to Running Prison.)

2571
01:31:21,352 --> 01:31:24,280
(The eight petty criminals' prison live start.)

2572
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,220
(Tofu is the only way they can escape.)

2573
01:31:26,224 --> 01:31:29,220
(If you want to leave, acquire tofu.)

2574
01:31:29,227 --> 01:31:30,990
(Tofu disappears.)

2575
01:31:30,995 --> 01:31:33,630
(Prison survival race for tofu)

2576
01:31:34,165 --> 01:31:36,400
Curse you! Three generations of your family will fall.

2577
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,160

2578
