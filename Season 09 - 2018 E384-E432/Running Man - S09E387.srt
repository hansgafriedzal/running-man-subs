1
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,780
My gosh, hello.

2
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,540
- Hello. Let me say hello again. - Hi.

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,540
- All right. - Hello.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,950
Hurry, and take the side seat.

5
00:00:16,285 --> 00:00:17,780
I haven't been to a rest area for a while.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,510
Rest areas serve great food, my gosh.

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,750
I must eat pork cutlet.

8
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,080
- Me too. - Pork cutlet.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,350
- Pork cutlets are delicious. - Or I want udon.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,720
- I had pork cutlet yesterday. - I want to eat udon.

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,760
So Min, it seems you didn't go to a salon today.

12
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,590
Seok Jin, what do you mean? Look at my thick makeup.

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,930
- Your makeup is thick? - You have makeup on?

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,890
- Yes. - The hat. Did you wash your hair?

15
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,900
Didn't actors in "The Age of Shadows" wear it?

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,030
Do people wear this kind of hat these days?

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,730
- Jun Jin used to wear this. - Really?

18
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:39,100
Jin used to wear this kind of hat a lot.

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,500
- Kye Sang wore this kind of hat. - That's right.

20
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,710
- Members of g.o.d wore it a lot. - It was when they sang "Road".

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,170
- It was when they sang "Road". - Exactly.

22
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,740
No, Jang Hyuk wore it first.

23
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,210
- Do you remember that? - Remember what?

24
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,350
- On Ryu Hyun Jin's wedding day... - I don't remember, Seok Jin.

25
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,810
Why can't you remember?

26
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,320
- Don't interrupt me. Why not? - I don't remember.

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,120
- Why are you interrupting me? - I don't remember.

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,750
Don't stop me. This is important.

29
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,520
- I don't remember the day. - You remember, Ji Hyo, right?

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,190
- You already talked about that. - Come again?

31
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,260
- What do you mean? - He already talked about it.

32
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,190
- When did I talk about it? - You talked about it last week.

33
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,860
- I talked about this? - You mentioned it last week.

34
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,560
- Are you sure? - You two talked about it.

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,430
Seok Jin, you talked about it during the opening segment.

36
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,810
I see.

37
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:12,570
What's happening with him?

38
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,870
Seok Jin is flustered now.

39
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,040
There must be an eraser in his head.

40
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,370
He's developing a new character. Seok Jin, player of the gate ball.

41
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,510
"Gate ball"?

42
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:21,680
(Play gate ball, and live a long, healthy life.)

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,910
Today, to celebrate the new year and in light of our wish for you...

44
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,260
to turn over a new leaf through missions, we prepared our race.

45
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,130
The race is Along with the New.

46
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:35,300
- "Along with the Gods" is popular. - "Along with the Gods".

47
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,760
- Someone might die today. - Someone...

48
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,100
- No, someone will get superpower. - Is that it?

49
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,430
- Don't talk about death. - Hey, by the way...

50
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,300
- It's not that. - I can't help but look at you.

51
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,410
(He chokes up.)

52
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,740
- Hey. - I end up looking at you.

53
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,900
- Seok Jin, stop it. - Yes, stop.

54
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,900
All is fair when it's about death.

55
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,870
- Don't talk about dying. - Promise me that you won't die.

56
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,020
(Promise me that you won't die.)

57
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:56,680
- I won't die. - Please, Seok Jin.

58
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,910
- I'm not going to die. - The order...

59
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,310
"I won't die."

60
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,120
Why do you think that I'm going to die?

61
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,050
No, I won't. I'm still healthy.

62
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,320
I don't even take health supplements despite my age.

63
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,700
- That's why you should take some. - Take some supplements.

64
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:11,030
- Take supplements. - Drop the act. Don't let it worsen.

65
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,290
- When you get old, - Right.

66
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,930
going to clinics should be part of your routine.

67
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,860
Stop it. That's enough.

68
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,930
I'm serious.

69
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,770
Before you start your race today, there is...

70
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,510
- a mission to get Chance Cards. - Really?

71
00:02:22,515 --> 00:02:25,210
We'll proceed with Along with a Spending Spree.

72
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,880
(Mission to gain Chance Cards, Along with a Spending Spree)

73
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:29,780
You won't get a lunch break today.

74
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:31,550
Starting now, you'll have your lunch.

75
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,220
Come up with an order after discussing among yourselves.

76
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,720
You need to buy food from the rest area within...

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,930
- 20-dollar budget in a relay. - In a relay?

78
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:41,860
If everyone buys a dish, the mission is successful.

79
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,470
If you accomplish your mission, only one member will be...

80
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:47,460
- given a special Chance Card. - A Chance Card?

81
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,130
If you fail the mission, one of the members will face a punishment.

82
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,130
From the start?

83
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,300
This sounds like it's about loyalty.

84
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,210
Isn't the probability to fail about 90 percent?

85
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,040
It's about 99.9 percent.

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,510
I think Se Chan and Kwang Soo should go last.

87
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,550
- No, I won't betray you. - Se Chan and Kwang Soo should.

88
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,820
- Se Chan does unexpected things. - Yes, he does.

89
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,680
- I do that when it's about money. - That's right.

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,150
Se Chan should be consistent with his character.

91
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,460
He should be either loyal or traitorous. He acts differently.

92
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,830
Se Chan would keep changing his sides and get nothing in the end.

93
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:21,860
I tend to change my side.

94
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,310
- He's involved in both teams. - I'm in both teams.

95
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,200
- We should decide the order. - Yes, let's do that.

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,970
Should we play the timing game?

97
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,380
- 1. - 2.

98
00:03:32,185 --> 00:03:33,240
(They will go 7th and 8th.)

99
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,810
- It's them. - You two will go last.

100
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,240
- You will go last. - Both of you will go last.

101
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,050
- What are you doing? - You'll go last.

102
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:39,450
The rest of us should play the timing game.

103
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,250
- One. - Both of you are out.

104
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,290
(Haha and Jong Kook will go 5th and 6th.)

105
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,490
Go over there.

106
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:46,350
Move down. Ji Hyo, come here.

107
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,460
- I can win by not doing anything. - This is nice.

108
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,730
- You must do nothing to win. - All right.

109
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,600
The four of us can play the game now.

110
00:03:52,605 --> 00:03:54,340
I guess we are inseparable, right?

111
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:57,070
- Right? - This is great. I like the order.

112
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,540
- Get ready. - What are we playing?

113
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:00,740
- The timing game. - I can win if I don't do anything.

114
00:04:01,685 --> 00:04:03,010
- 1. - 2.

115
00:04:03,045 --> 00:04:04,280
Three.

116
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,350
(You fools. I can win this game if I don't do anything.)

117
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:11,150
(What?)

118
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,750
- Move down. - This is weird.

119
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,420
- Move down. - Move to this side.

120
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,390
- Ji Hyo, sit in the third seat. - You're not motivated at all.

121
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:17,460
- Come here. - Move down.

122
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,490
This is weird. I should've won since I did nothing.

123
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:22,100
If you do nothing, you'll become a pushover.

124
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:25,060
Is there a hat festival today?

125
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,590
- One. - We didn't start yet.

126
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,800
We just started.

127
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,030
- I have to say, "Start". - You said, "Start".

128
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,100
Start when I say the word.

129
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,510
You're quick since you look like Jun Jin.

130
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,210
- She's quick. - She's the fastest.

131
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:37,540
All right. Start.

132
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,680
One.

133
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:40,280
Two.

134
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,110
- 1. - 2.

135
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,710
(So Min loses just like Seok Jin.)

136
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,350
- Jin, come here. - Move.

137
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,610
- Jin, come here. - Move down here.

138
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,350
I will get to eat though.

139
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,020
Hey, move down. Get out of here.

140
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:52,230
- I will get a turn, right? Ji Hyo. - Move down.

141
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:54,060
Ji Hyo and I should play rock-paper-scissors.

142
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:55,660
Rock-paper-scissors

143
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:56,930
(Jae Seok will go 1st.)

144
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,170
- I'll go first. - Gosh.

145
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,400
I have a bad feeling about Jae Seok.

146
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,800
Okay!

147
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,970
- Jae Seok shouldn't go first. - Okay.

148
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,470
Hey, don't you know me? I don't...

149
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,840
- You like to spend money. - I'm quite sensible.

150
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,470
- You can spend up to 3 dollars. - Spend only 2 dollars and 50 cents.

151
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,110
- Only spend three dollars. - Jae Seok.

152
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,920
I will eat moderately.

153
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:18,210
Is today's special about test-takers?

154
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,190
(Is today's special about test-takers?)

155
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:22,360
- Seriously? Okay, fine. - Look at him.

156
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:24,290
- I see how it is. I got it. - Your outfit is horrible.

157
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,920
I see. You pointed at me.

158
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,560
- I got it. - Okay.

159
00:05:27,965 --> 00:05:29,660
- I changed my mind. - What's your color coordination?

160
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,930
I didn't change my outfit because I was lazy.

161
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,660
- Buy your food, and bring it here. - Jae Seok.

162
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,360
Just have ramyeon. That's neat.

163
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,740
I had breakfast before coming here,

164
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,110
so I can't eat a lot.

165
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:41,770
You can't eat a lot.

166
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,910
- You had breakfast? - I had breakfast.

167
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:44,970
- I don't overeat. - Jae Seok.

168
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,480
- Let's be reasonable. - Don't you worry.

169
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,040
- People don't want us to overdo it. - Don't worry.

170
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,780
- Hey, viewers hate it the most... - Did I upset him?

171
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,620
- when they can't understand us. - Right. They must understand us.

172
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,720
- That's right. - Okay.

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,520
I really had breakfast.

174
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,490
(Will he make a reasonable decision?)

175
00:05:58,595 --> 00:05:59,860
What should I eat?

176
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:01,630
- Hello. - Hi.

177
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:04,860
(He passes by the food that gives off tempting smell...)

178
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,170
(and arrives at the food court.)

179
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,740
There are a lot of delicious dishes.

180
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:11,310
What should I eat?

181
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:13,110
That...

182
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:14,670
(Jae Seok is entranced by the menu.)

183
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,240
I really want to eat seafood soft tofu stew.

184
00:06:16,415 --> 00:06:17,470
Then I will have...

185
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,550
(Which dish did he choose after contemplating?)

186
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:22,350
- A dollar. - After looking at the order,

187
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:23,780
I won't be able to eat.

188
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
- I'm not sure about So Min. - So Min...

189
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,150
I'll just have a bowl of udon.

190
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,620
- That's five dollars. - Please let me have udon.

191
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:31,420
What's taking him so long? Which dish did he choose?

192
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,560
- He must have ordered a main dish. - Why is he taking so long?

193
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,920
(He starts talking out of the blue.)

194
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,660
Just buy fishcake on a stick. Hey, buy a small dish.

195
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,460
(What?)

196
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,470
(Whom is he talking to?)

197
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,240
- There's no one there. - We are at a rest area.

198
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,370
- Seok Jin, no one's there. - Really?

199
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,540
- Whom are you talking to? - You did that on purpose, right?

200
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,670
No one is there, Seok Jin.

201
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,840
I thought he was talking to the Grim Reaper.

202
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,420
Seok Jin, promise me that you won't die.

203
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,250
- Get a grip. Get yourself together. - That surprised me.

204
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,910
We are at a rest area.

205
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,110
- You startled me. - He talked to the empty space.

206
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,860
- I didn't look at that side. - Whom was he talking to?

207
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:02,920
- I didn't see... - No one was there.

208
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,560
I didn't look there, but rest areas always serve fishcake on a stick.

209
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,860
- Why don't they have it here? - Sorry?

210
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:09,360
He's back.

211
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:11,290
- Jae Seok is back. - He's coming back.

212
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,590
- What did he bring? - He has soup.

213
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,730
What is he bringing?

214
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:16,160
- That's good. - That's not that bad.

215
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,470
- That's pretty good. - That's great.

216
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,830
- How much was it? - How much?

217
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,470
- Jae Seok. - That looks delicious.

218
00:07:20,685 --> 00:07:22,380
- Right? - Give Ji Hyo the rest of money.

219
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,410
(Jae Seok chooses jjajangmyeon.)

220
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,310
- How much was it? - How much?

221
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,680
- Jae Seok, how much was it? - It must be 4 or 5 dollars.

222
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,710
Ji Hyo, take the money, and go.

223
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,860
- How much was it? - Take it, and go.

224
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:37,350
- I'll be back. - Don't show it. Pick what you want.

225
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,720
- Okay. - What kind of food do they have?

226
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,160
- Are there a lot? - They serve every kind of food.

227
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,660
You sprinkled chili powder.

228
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,370
You bet.

229
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,170
That looks really good. It's steaming.

230
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,870
No, Jae Seok.

231
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,310
- He's going to slurp. - My gosh.

232
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,670
- Right? My gosh. - Goodness.

233
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,400
You won't be hungry for the whole day, Jae Seok.

234
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,470
When he eats noodles, his slurping sounds really tasty.

235
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,310
The shape of his mouth is cute.

236
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:03,210
When viewers watch this, some of them will order jjajangmyeon.

237
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,920
I agree. He's enjoying jjajangmyeon more than usual.

238
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:08,490
To be honest, I had breakfast before coming here.

239
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,560
I'm going to eat some snacks.

240
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,230
I want to eat tteokbokki. It's three dollars.

241
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,060
That's expensive.

242
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,590
(Which dish did she choose?)

243
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,460
If everyone chooses a two-dollar dish,

244
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,670
- Right. - it'd be a happy ending.

245
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:24,610
Let's buy cheap dishes, so Jae Seok looks selfish.

246
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:26,040
It's really hot.

247
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:28,040
- Then... - What did you buy?

248
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,100
- What is that? - What did you buy?

249
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,280
- That's so nice of you. - She's so nice.

250
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,270
Ji Hyo. I bet that only cost a dollar.

251
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,540
(Ji Hyo chooses...)

252
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,840
(garaetteok.)

253
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,050
That's garaetteok.

254
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,920
Ji Hyo, will this be enough for your lunch?

255
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:41,820
- What's this? - Goodness, Ji Hyo.

256
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,950
What are you doing? That's mine!

257
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,490
- That's mine. - Stop that, Seok Jin.

258
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,720
(Seok Jin steals garaetteok.)

259
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,500
- What are you doing? - Hey! Shoot.

260
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:51,030
She gave me the green light that I can take it.

261
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:53,560
- Really? - No. Ji Hyo didn't do that.

262
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,400
- You gave me the green light. - When did I do that?

263
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:57,570
- You took it and split it. - Seriously?

264
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,200
- Seok Jin. - Can he do that?

265
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,740
- I apologize on his behalf. - I bet you'll do the right thing.

266
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,980
I'm off now.

267
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,750
- Be back soon. - I'll be back.

268
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:09,380
I really want to eat udon.

269
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,810
(So Min only wanted to eat udon.)

270
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,880
What should I do?

271
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,250
(Thinking)

272
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,860
"Udon". I want udon.

273
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:21,460
Actually, I suffered from the flu and gastritis a few days ago,

274
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,220
so I didn't get to eat anything for a week.

275
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,530
I don't even have eggs at home.

276
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,700
I want to eat pork cutlet and udon, but I can only eat one, right?

277
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:33,340
(She can only choose one. Which dish did So Min choose?)

278
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:36,180
When I calculated the prices, it's about 4 dollars and 50 cents.

279
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,970
No. Jae Seok's dish costs over four dollars.

280
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,140
- Let's say it's about 5 dollars. - 5 dollars.

281
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,620
- Then it's 8 dollars already. - This must be 2 dollars.

282
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:47,380
You need to think about why...

283
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,720
the production crew set the limit at 20 dollars.

284
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,620
The games don't pop out of nowhere.

285
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,190
They are actually played at research center.

286
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,500
Is there a research center?

287
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,490
There are staff members who play eight of us.

288
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,700
Did you know that?

289
00:09:58,705 --> 00:10:00,490
Through simulations...

290
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,760
Then the person who plays me must be hot-headed.

291
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,100
That person...

292
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,600
He comes out of prison...

293
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,070
(He comes out of the prison...)

294
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,110
He comes just for the simulations of the games.

295
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,840
That actor was replaced many times.

296
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,180
- Really? - Yes.

297
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:16,940
- The actor can be replaced. - It has happened many times.

298
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,420
- Really? - Yes.

299
00:10:18,425 --> 00:10:20,620
It's not easy to play me.

300
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,990
What's taking So Min so long?

301
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,690
Is So Min back?

302
00:10:24,695 --> 00:10:26,590
- There she comes. - She is back.

303
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,490
- A hat from "The Age of Shadows". - Kim Tak Goo.

304
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,590
There she comes.

305
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,230
There comes Kim Tak Goo.

306
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,670
- What do you have? - How many dishes did she buy?

307
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,730
- How many dishes did you buy? - I only ordered udon.

308
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,410
She gave me pork cutlet for free.

309
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:40,230
(Udon...)

310
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,680
(and pork cutlet?)

311
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,810
She asked, "You are Jeon So Min, right?"

312
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,410
"Please take this."

313
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,920
Don't lie.

314
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:50,750
Are you saying it was given for free?

315
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,610
Yes. I only ordered udon.

316
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,080
The employee said the pork cutlet is a wrong order.

317
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,120
There is no way you got that big pork cutlet for free.

318
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,250
The pork cutlet is the main dish.

319
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,120
- No, it's not. - That doesn't make any sense.

320
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,460
Udon usually isn't served...

321
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,430
- in that dish. - That's an earthen pot.

322
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,230
We are counting on you, Seok Jin.

323
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,400
Seok Jin.

324
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,040
- We have a good chance. - That's right.

325
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:12,000
I didn't get a lot of money.

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,770
We can make it work.

327
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:16,510
I only have small bills, too.

328
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:18,340
So Min.

329
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,610
You know,

330
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,580
I wanted to share with everyone.

331
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,080
Kim Tak Goo, make sure you eat everything.

332
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,010
I don't even have eggs at home.

333
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,250
(She tries to make the members feel sorry for her.)

334
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,620
You live alone.

335
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:33,490
I am sure she doesn't want to eat this much.

336
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,530
She did it to be funny.

337
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,090
I should think of it as a joke.

338
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,370
It's a variety show, after all.

339
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:42,170
I can't believe she did that.

340
00:11:43,915 --> 00:11:46,240
My heart is pounding right now.

341
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,300
Before a fight,

342
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,640
elementary school students' heart pound.

343
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:53,450
I wouldn't say it happens before a fight.

344
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,850
It happens before a beating.

345
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,110
So Min, eat up. You really wanted those dishes.

346
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,650
Jong Kook, my heart is pounding.

347
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,180
I bet my fortune...

348
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,990
that Jong Kook will make So Min cry in two months.

349
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,450
- It will happen in 2 months. - It won't happen in 2 months.

350
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,750
It will happen today.

351
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,930
So Min's dad will call Jong Kook.

352
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,500
"Jong Kook, I apologize."

353
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:14,100
(I am sure So Min did it to be funny.)

354
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,500
I can't believe So Min.

355
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:20,880
I got a dollar and 50 cents.

356
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,940
(Does that mean 3 people spent 18 dollars and 50 cents?)

357
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,910
There are eight of us.

358
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:28,280
Not everyone will be able to eat.

359
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,580
Not everyone will be able to eat.

360
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,710
Please give me jjajangmyeon.

361
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,210
(Jae Seok ordered a 6-dollar jjajangmyeon.)

362
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,680
Please give me garaetteok.

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,750
(Ji Hyo, who wasn't hungry, ordered a 2-dollar garaetteok.)

364
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,350
Please give me a pork cutlet and udon set.

365
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,750
(So Min ordered a dish that costs a 10 dollar and 50 cent.)

366
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,190
(Worried)

367
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,060
Seok Jin will be able to eat, right?

368
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,190
(The change is a dollar and 50 cents.)

369
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,130
What will I eat with this money?

370
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,240
(What is Seok Jin's decision?)

371
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:53,610
Seok Jin!

372
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,200
He is nice.

373
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,940
- Really? - He is nice.

374
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,370
- He bought red bean jelly. - He is really nice.

375
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,580
Did you buy red bean jelly?

376
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:04,110
The current situation left me with no choice.

377
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,250
Really?

378
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:07,950
- The current situation? - What does that mean?

379
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,120
- Seok Jin, what happened? - Give me the change.

380
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,200
(My goodness.)

381
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,530
There should be at least 10 dollars left.

382
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,090
Jong Kook, get going.

383
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,700
(She feels like she is chewing sand.)

384
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:22,700
All right.

385
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,570
(Jong Kook leaves with 60 cents.)

386
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:25,910
Jong Kook.

387
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,510
For goodness' sake!

388
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,910
I can't believe Jong Kook!

389
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,740
(She throws punches as soon as Jong Kook leaves.)

390
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,080
I can't believe Jong Kook!

391
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:36,620
For goodness' sake!

392
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:40,820
Kim Jong Kook!

393
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:43,120
Ji Hyo did this in the past.

394
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,330
- Ji Hyo. - The past is repeating itself.

395
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,530
I will rip Jong Kook's name tag and get eliminated.

396
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,630
Hey! Be quiet!

397
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,100
(So Min is like the delinquent version of Ji Hyo...)

398
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,230
(that was often brought out due to Jong Kook's cool-headedness.)

399
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,230
Ji Hyo, I am so upset.

400
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,610
- Seriously. - I understand.

401
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:02,440
You have a long way to go.

402
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:04,470
Have you sworn at Jong Kook?

403
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,780
Of course I have.

404
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:07,640
- There he comes. - He is back.

405
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
I think he bought a soda.

406
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:13,220
Am I wrong?

407
00:14:14,565 --> 00:14:16,390
- No, he didn't. - He didn't.

408
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:17,660
Seok Jin, please.

409
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:19,760
Stop imagining things.

410
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:21,320
You need to be careful.

411
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,090
Is the person with the soda holding a scythe by any chance?

412
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,270
(Seok Jin, it's time to go.)

413
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:31,730
Stop it!

414
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,370
(Don't follow a stranger.)

415
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,510
He is back. He is back.

416
00:14:35,645 --> 00:14:37,140
Your steps are light.

417
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,740
Of course they are.

418
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,970
I don't have much in my pockets.

419
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,220
You don't?

420
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:43,310
Didn't you buy anything?

421
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,720
- Didn't you buy anything? - I did.

422
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,350
You bought gum.

423
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,620
- Really? - How much money do we have left?

424
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,220
Was the change enough to buy gum?

425
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,620
(He gives Haha the change.)

426
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,890
What is this?

427
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:58,500
(He gets 10 cents.)

428
00:14:59,035 --> 00:15:01,060
- He brought food. - Did he bring food?

429
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,560
For goodness' sake.

430
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,870
- Really? - It's better to eat.

431
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,140
- Is that all? - Thus,

432
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:10,240
the mission fails since you spent over 20 dollars.

433
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,750
Se Chan and Kwang Soo won't be able to eat.

434
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:16,380
Why did you set the limit to 20 dollars?

435
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,150
It's not the matter of the limit. How much did you have?

436
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,450
I had 10 cents.

437
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:21,880
(I see.)

438
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,720
I thought you would have 50 cents.

439
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,360
So Min's dish...

440
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:28,430
- is the most expensive. - In the entire rest area, right?

441
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:31,730
It's the most expensive dish in the entire rest area.

442
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,990
It couldn't have been a random choice.

443
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,230
I will take a piece of gum as a dessert.

444
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,330
(It's the gum Jong Kook bought.)

445
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,500
It's dessert.

446
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,740
(Eat up, So Min.)

447
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:39,730
Everyone got to eat something...

448
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,740
except for you and me.

449
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,840
I drank two bottles of water...

450
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,080
- because my throat went dry. - Me, too.

451
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,950
I finished my bottle of water.

452
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,320
Along with a Spending Spree...

453
00:15:52,325 --> 00:15:55,350
was a failure since you spent more than 20 dollars.

454
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,120
One of you will get Penalty Card.

455
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,030
The person with this card will get a penalty no matter what.

456
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:02,530
It's a game of chance.

457
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,860
- How will we decide? - There is a container of spoons.

458
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,230
That's how a member will be chosen.

459
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,760
(The container has spoons with the numbers from 1 to 8.)

460
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,500
The worst-case scenario is Jong Kook getting the Penalty Card.

461
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,700
The worst-case scenario is Jong Kook getting the Penalty Card.

462
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,800
Give me the penalty instead!

463
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,040
Spare Jong Kook.

464
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:19,440
That would be the worst.

465
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,780
He will visit So Min in her dream.

466
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:24,210
- Pick a number. - Let's go...

467
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,980
- Let's go with four. - That's the unlucky number.

468
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,220
Let's go with four.

469
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,950
The person who gets four will receive the penalty.

470
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,130
Okay.

471
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:32,760
Don't look.

472
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,360
It will be incredible if he gets four.

473
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,590
Yes, it will be incredible if he gets four.

474
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,590
(Being the unlucky one, Kwang Soo may choose four.)

475
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,600
4! 4!

476
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,330
- Show us right away. - 4! 4!

477
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,970
- It's three. - Okay.

478
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,600
(Kwang Soo avoids the penalty.)

479
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,380
(That's too bad.)

480
00:16:48,915 --> 00:16:54,110
If no one gets it before it's Jong Kook's turn...

481
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:55,850
Imagine if I picked four.

482
00:16:55,955 --> 00:16:57,480
(He picks 6 and avoids the penalty.)

483
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
- 6! Okay! - Everyone, 4 should go...

484
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
(Not knowing what the penalty is makes them nervous.)

485
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,930
So Min.

486
00:17:04,935 --> 00:17:07,060
You are done for if Jong Kook picks four.

487
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:11,370
Then the real nightmare will begin.

488
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:12,890
Five!

489
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,200
(He picks 5 and survives.)

490
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,740
My goodness.

491
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,300
My goodness.

492
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:21,800
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

493
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,300
(The container passes by the unluckiest ones.)

494
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,480
Everyone.

495
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:26,550
Look at this.

496
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:29,810
The numbers that were picked are 3, 5, and 6.

497
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,420
Four will complete the sequence.

498
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,250
My goodness.

499
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:34,960
It's the empty spot.

500
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:36,520
- Four is the empty spot. - It's the empty spot.

501
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,230
- If Jong Kook picks 4... - Jong Kook, pick 4.

502
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:40,790
My goodness.

503
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,860
The envelope is black, your favorite color.

504
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,770
- This is unbelievable. - Pick four.

505
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:47,260
- If I pick 4... - Pick 4.

506
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
The spirit of variety shows is on your side.

507
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,930
(Jong Kook picks the fourth spoon.)

508
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,540
- So Min. - So Min, pray.

509
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,830
- So Min, pray. - Four.

510
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,200
- So Min. - So Min, pray.

511
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,580
- So Min, pray. - Four.

512
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:57,810
Show us.

513
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,840
It's four!

514
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,350
(He gets goosebumps.)

515
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,890
(The unthinkable happens.)

516
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,650
(The members and the staff are shocked.)

517
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,790
(Furious Jong Kook warning is issued.)

518
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,890
(What should I do?)

519
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,130
So Min!

520
00:18:16,135 --> 00:18:18,230
This is a disaster!

521
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:20,230
- Did he really pick four? - How did this happen?

522
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,630
- I got goosebumps. - This is it.

523
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,630
3, 4, 5, 6. You filled the empty spot.

524
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,830
I filled the empty spot.

525
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,100
So Min will feel so uncomfortable today.

526
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,350
So Min's face went pale.

527
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:34,110
She will feel more uncomfortable when the penalty is revealed.

528
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,750
We will move to the next location for Three People Race.

529
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:39,880
- Okay. - Let's go.

530
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,820
(What is the ending of this ridiculous drama?)

531
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:44,630
It's a miraculous day.

532
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:47,230
The chemistry between the national siblings shine.

533
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:51,590
That's why I am sitting between them.

534
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,860
(That's why I am sitting between them.)

535
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,970
(Jae Seok is my shield.)

536
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,830
Before we reach the next location,

537
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,600
you will have a mission to win the Chance Card...

538
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,200
since you already took the Penalty Card.

539
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,340
(It's a mission to win a Chance Card.)

540
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,410
It's called Pinocchio's Answer.

541
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,040
- Pinocchio's Answer? - Is it about lying?

542
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,010
Answer the producer's three question...

543
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,780
with lies in three seconds.

544
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,450
One of the members who succeed...

545
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,520
will receive the Chance Card.

546
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,750
You know each other pretty well.

547
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,920
If you think a member is telling the truth,

548
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,230
blow the whistle.

549
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:24,660
Who wants to go first?

550
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,430
- I will go first. - Seok Jin will go first.

551
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,160
- Get ready. - Okay.

552
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
Let's go.

553
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,060
What's your real name?

554
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,640
Jee Seok Jin.

555
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:35,180
(What?)

556
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:37,200
You're supposed to lie.

557
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
- It's so hard. - You should've said, "Ji Seok Sam".

558
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,670
- You should've said, "Seok Sam". - You're right.

559
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,280
- It's not that easy. - Gosh.

560
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,540
- It's hard. - We're...

561
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,190
- launching a new game right now. - I know.

562
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:49,450
You should have started it right.

563
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,120
- Let's see how good you are. - This is a launch party.

564
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,520
Let's see how good you are.

565
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,490
You shouldn't launch the game this way.

566
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:57,830
I'll watch you.

567
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,260
Why did you ruin everything?

568
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,540
No one came to our launch party.

569
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,800
- Watch, and learn from me. - Ready.

570
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,510
Start. What do you do first thing in the morning?

571
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,410
Goodness...

572
00:20:09,785 --> 00:20:11,180
(Goodness)

573
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,170
- Jae Seok. - What's different from Seok Jin?

574
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,780
Can't I say that?

575
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,440
- Say your answer right away. - Can't I?

576
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,410
- Say it right away. - All right.

577
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,910
I didn't know.

578
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,950
I get it.

579
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,560
- Let's try again. Ready. - Okay.

580
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:26,060
Start. How much do you weigh?

581
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,000
I weigh 102kg.

582
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,660
Who do you talk to on the phone most often?

583
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,970
- See? - Well...

584
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:36,900
Hey, why can't you say, "Angelina Jolie"?

585
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,440
- That'd be okay, right? - "I weigh 102kg" was weird too.

586
00:20:39,545 --> 00:20:41,780
- He didn't have to say that. - Okay.

587
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:43,400
I get it. You try.

588
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,040
Okay. I'm good at this kind of game.

589
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,450
- Let's try. - Okay.

590
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:51,250
Start. Do you like So Min?

591
00:20:51,295 --> 00:20:53,890
No... Yes.

592
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:56,760
What do you call your girlfriend?

593
00:20:57,095 --> 00:20:58,190
Honey.

594
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,090
See?

595
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:02,760
(Honey)

596
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,800
- Honey. - You do call her honey.

597
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,600
Why can't you say, "Bear Paw"?

598
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
(Coaching)

599
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:14,370
- What? - What are you saying?

600
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,640
If I play like you...

601
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,340
- What is he saying? - You're bad too.

602
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,040
After doing such a bad job, what are you saying?

603
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,110
Why is it so hard?

604
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,780
- Haha, try. - Gosh.

605
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,590
Ready, start. What comes to your mind when you see Jong Kook?

606
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,490
I want to kill him. Hold on.

607
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,090
You mean it.

608
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,560
I was lying.

609
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:37,020
It's not a lie.

610
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,860
- I was lying. - He even said it to me once.

611
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,890
- Really? - Hold on.

612
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,360
- He doesn't understand the game. - No.

613
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,900
- I was lying. - He meant it.

614
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,240
He meant it.

615
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:46,930
Ji Hyo, try.

616
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,770
- Ji Hyo, let's try. - Good luck.

617
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,000
Ready, start.

618
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,210
What is your real name?

619
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:53,710
Kim Jong Kook.

620
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:55,250
Who are you most uncomfortable with among the members?

621
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,380
Kim Jong Kook.

622
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,020
That's true.

623
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,820
- That's true. - Why did you tell the truth?

624
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,420
- Hold on. - Why...

625
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,190
Every time someone says something about me...

626
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:10,530
- Why did she say, "Jong Kook"? - Why is it true every time?

627
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,630
You said, "Jong Kook", both times.

628
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,070
- What's going on? - Jong Kook just said,

629
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:18,740
"Why is it true every time someone says something about me?"

630
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:20,440
It might be a lie.

631
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,670
- But it's true. - It might be a lie.

632
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,850
- Jong Kook should try. - Try.

633
00:22:24,855 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll only tell lies.

634
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,870
- Ready, start. - Okay.

635
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,750
- Your best body part? - Neck.

636
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:34,690
- Your favorite, Haha or Se Chan? - Se Chan.

637
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,250
You have a girlfriend hidden in the US, right?

638
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,660
- Se Chan... - Yes.

639
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,350
After all the things I've done...

640
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,620
Hold on.

641
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,160
He didn't even hesitate.

642
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,030
- He didn't even hesitate. - No one blew the whistle.

643
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,360
I wanted to blow the whistle,

644
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,470
but everyone else was quiet.

645
00:22:48,745 --> 00:22:50,500
I got hurt.

646
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,170
What have I done for the past year?

647
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,800
I've been taking care of him for the past year.

648
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,240
Haha looks so happy.

649
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:00,140
- I like it. - I lied.

650
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,710
- I was going to blow the whistle. - Give him the last question.

651
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,250
If he succeeds, he'll win a Chance Card.

652
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:05,280
I did ask the last question, but let me ask another one.

653
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,850
- Okay. - Ready, start.

654
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,890
- Who is the most beautiful actress? - Ji Hyo.

655
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:14,450
(This is tricky.)

656
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,620
(It's true.)

657
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,560
It's true.

658
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,830
Why is it true?

659
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,530
It's not true.

660
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,060
Something's bothering me.

661
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,860
- I've seen beautiful actresses. - We're just playing a game,

662
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,900
but why do you say each other's name?

663
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,510
It's because she's in my sight right now.

664
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:32,240
So is So Min.

665
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,340
Do you think I would want to say her name right now?

666
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,550
(Do you think I would want to say her name right now?)

667
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:40,090
- Even if it's a lie... - Not today.

668
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,320
Who do you want to give a second chance?

669
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,350
I don't think they were fair to me.

670
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,060
Give Haha another chance.

671
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:48,390
Ready, start.

672
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,390
How tall are you?

673
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,830
203cm.

674
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,730
Who is your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?

675
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:56,500
(Who is your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?)

676
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,970
Jong Kook.

677
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,170
Hold on.

678
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:05,140
(Jong Kook gets hurt and hits Haha.)

679
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,540
- Hold on. - Jong Kook.

680
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,180
- It's not like that. - This is how I felt.

681
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,810
- I felt this way too. - Hold on.

682
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:14,550
That's how I felt.

683
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:17,750
- It's not like that. - That was funny.

684
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,290
- Jae Seok is older. - That was funny.

685
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,690
You're sitting next to me.

686
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,390
Why don't you let Kwang Soo try again?

687
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,100
- He's good. - Let him try again.

688
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:26,490
- He's good. - Jong Kook...

689
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,800
(Please ask the same question.)

690
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:32,940
- Give me a question. - Next.

691
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:34,710
In your life...

692
00:24:36,845 --> 00:24:40,270
(In your life...)

693
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,250
Who's your favorite, Jae Seok or Jong Kook?

694
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,190
Jong Kook.

695
00:24:47,025 --> 00:24:48,450
(He thought it'd be a different question,)

696
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,150
(but it was the same.)

697
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,450
(He gave the same answer.)

698
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,020
(He blows the whistle.)

699
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,160
(Do you hear the whistle? I really like Jong Kook better.)

700
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Both times...

701
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,760
I can't believe you.

702
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,660
Think of all the things Jong Kook has done for you.

703
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,600
- That question was weird. - You're so ungrateful.

704
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,030
I blew the whistle.

705
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,540
Ask the same question to Se Chan.

706
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,010
This is your last year anyway.

707
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,910
I blew the whistle.

708
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,320
- This is your last year. - I blew the whistle.

709
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:19,080
(Laughing)

710
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,890
- The sound was so loud. - It was.

711
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,060
It sounded like you crushed a watermelon.

712
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:27,050
Why would you exaggerate so much?

713
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,060
How many people are you fighting with?

714
00:25:29,065 --> 00:25:31,260
It didn't sound like that.

715
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,730
- Do you want to hear that sound? - He's a fighting cock.

716
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,030
He's a fighting cock.

717
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,270
He really is a fighting cock.

718
00:25:38,445 --> 00:25:40,940
He really is a fighting cock.

719
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:42,500
He's picking fights...

720
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,140
A fighting cock?

721
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:47,280
Kwang Soo said it first.

722
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:49,040
- I said it quietly. - This is so funny.

723
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,350
- A fighting cock? - He said it first.

724
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,320
- I didn't say it, Kwang Soo did. - I can't believe it.

725
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,750
Do you know what's really scary?

726
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,750
Seok Jin isn't saying anything.

727
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,490
(He isn't saying a word.)

728
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:03,030
He doesn't want to get in trouble with Jong Kook.

729
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,360
He's being so quiet.

730
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,400
I should protect my pride.

731
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:09,070
- I should protect my pride. - Gosh.

732
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,530
Seok Jin is so...

733
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,340
You failed to win Chance Cards.

734
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:16,770
(Where is this bus...)

735
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,240
(headed?)

736
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,840
- Where are we going? - Okay.

737
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,180
What's that?

738
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,340
- Wait. - Oh, my.

739
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,610
- It says, "correction". - It says, "correction".

740
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,880
- Where are we? - What's happening?

741
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,120
What's that?

742
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,090
- We're at a prison. - Hold on.

743
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:32,460
We're at a prison.

744
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:33,820
Hold on.

745
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
At last, you're taking us to a prison?

746
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,060
What's going on?

747
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,170
(The walls isolate the prisoners from the outside world.)

748
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:43,100
- For real? - Aren't those prison uniforms?

749
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,740
- Is this "Prison Playbook"? - Are we at a prison?

750
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:46,200
Is this really a prison?

751
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,740
- Are we going in? - Are we going in?

752
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,840
(Welcome to Running Prison.)

753
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,580
- Seriously? - By the way,

754
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,240
this place suits Jong Kook very well.

755
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,310
(This place suits Jong Kook.)

756
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:55,640
He deserves to be here.

757
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
- What are you saying? - It suits him so well.

758
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,550
- He's finally here. - Think of all your sins.

759
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:02,250
- That's not true. - Think of all the fights.

760
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,520
He's our fighting cock.

761
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,620
As a part of our project, Along with the New,

762
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,690
we came to this place to become new people.

763
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,020
Why would you bring us to a prison?

764
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,090
Why are we at a prison?

765
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,860
- Before we start the race, - We have to escape?

766
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,140
I'll tell you what crimes you committed in the previous mission.

767
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:21,570
You'll serve a certain time before you're released as a new person.

768
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:24,240
Along with the New, Crime and Punishment.

769
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:26,980
- We have to serve time? - We have to serve time?

770
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,720
We have to serve a sentence?

771
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:31,010
Let me tell you what crimes you committed.

772
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,620
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

773
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,850
You committed disorderly conduct by taking off your clothes.

774
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,790
- That's right. - That's right.

775
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:41,260
(Does he really have a stylist?)

776
00:27:42,365 --> 00:27:46,430
(Jae Seok suddenly takes off his clothes during the shoot.)

777
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:53,470
(Jae Seok commits disorderly conduct by taking off his clothes.)

778
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:56,740
I undressed because I was hot. That's disorderly conduct?

779
00:27:56,845 --> 00:28:00,580
Haha committed defamation by ridiculing Jae Seok's style.

780
00:28:01,255 --> 00:28:04,180
Seok Jin committed theft by eating Ji Hyo's rice cakes.

781
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,310
We were just sharing it.

782
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,550
Jong Kook committed verbal violence...

783
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,850
by telling Seok Jin he'd get Alzheimer's.

784
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,250
- That's right. - He deserves it.

785
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,060
- He deserves to go to prison. - He deserves it.

786
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,090
- I knew it. - My goodness.

787
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,490
He committed physical violence by hitting others' heads too.

788
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,760
You committed two crimes.

789
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,600
So Min spent too much money and caused an internal disturbance.

790
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,300
- So Min? - An internal disturbance.

791
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,410
Se Chan committed defamation...

792
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:32,110
by making fun of Seok Jin.

793
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,650
- Defamation. - Defamation?

794
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:37,510
Ji Hyo abetted the other members in spending too much money.

795
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,650
- You abetted the others. - Is that a crime?

796
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:41,110
Kwang Soo.

797
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,590
I didn't do anything.

798
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,780
- What about Kwang Soo? - Kwang Soo.

799
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,560
I didn't do anything today.

800
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,850
Kwang Soo...

801
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,830
I didn't do anything wrong.

802
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,600
Kwang Soo...

803
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:53,290
didn't do anything special. He neglected his duties.

804
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,770
What are you talking about?

805
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:56,500
I can't believe this.

806
00:28:56,505 --> 00:28:58,870
This is ridiculous. What are you talking about?

807
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,370
I made you guys laugh so hard.

808
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,170
You neglected your duties.

809
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,500
What are you talking about?

810
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,580
His crime is so trivial.

811
00:29:06,785 --> 00:29:08,450
It's so insignificant.

812
00:29:08,555 --> 00:29:09,850
Hold on.

813
00:29:09,985 --> 00:29:12,250
I committed violence now.

814
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,410
It hurt my pride.

815
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,850
He didn't do anything.

816
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,720
Your sentence will be determined now.

817
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,020
Your sentence will be determined randomly...

818
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,660
- by drawing cards. - This is important.

819
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,930
It'll determine how long you'll shoot today.

820
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,030
- Really? - Really?

821
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,560
- It ranges from 2 hours... - What?

822
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,030
to 12 hours.

823
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,830
- Can we really go home? - Can we really go home?

824
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,370
- Yes. - We can go home?

825
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,340
If you pick 2 hours, you can leave in 2 hours.

826
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:39,810
For Jong Kook's penalty,

827
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,610
it'll be the double of what he picks.

828
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,520
(Jong Kook's penalty will be doubled.)

829
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:50,260
- Is it 24 hours if he picks 12? - Yes.

830
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:53,890
(I need 24 hours)

831
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,000
(He's angry.)

832
00:29:55,005 --> 00:29:56,330
My goodness.

833
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,160
24 hours

834
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,290
- What are you doing? - I meant...

835
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,800
- 24 hours - What are you doing?

836
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,430
I meant 24 hours...

837
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,570
(What did you say?)

838
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,640
(Do you want to be scolded for 24 hours?)

839
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,010
The person who comes in last...

840
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:15,540
will get self-bathing penalty on top of...

841
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,250
- Self-bathing? - his original sentence.

842
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,780
(The person who comes in last...)

843
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,320
(will receive an additional self-bathing penalty.)

844
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,050
Pick a card in a random order.

845
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,920
- I pick this one. - I'll take the last one.

846
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,260
- Only show it to your cameraman. - I'll take the last one.

847
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,260
Dong Hwan.

848
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,970
- I have a strong feeling about it. - Do you want to switch?

849
00:30:35,575 --> 00:30:37,200
- Okay. - Is it a secret?

850
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:38,260
- Let's exchange. - It's a secret.

851
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,840
You may exchange them.

852
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:46,750
(Why is she smiling?)

853
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,420
Okay.

854
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,520
(Sighing)

855
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,050
It's me.

856
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,060
(What's Jong Kook's sentence?)

857
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:04,700
(It's 12 hours.)

858
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:06,660
(His sentence is 24 hours.)

859
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,870
Gosh, I can't do this.

860
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:13,600
Jong Kook's sentence is a minimum of four hours...

861
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,310
to a maximum of 24 hours.

862
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,510
- By the way... - He looks quite upset.

863
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,740
(He doesn't look happy.)

864
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,850
Did he pick 12 hours?

865
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:24,250
- Did you? - Who picked two hours?

866
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:27,150
- After the shoot, - My friends.

867
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,890
what you should do...

868
00:31:28,965 --> 00:31:31,660
is go abroad that's over five hours away.

869
00:31:31,965 --> 00:31:33,390
Take a plane, okay?

870
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:37,020
You'll change into prisoner attire.

871
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,160
Please follow the prison guard's order.

872
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,260
(They enter Running Prison.)

873
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,930
- My goodness. - Gosh.

874
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:44,360
- Thank you. - Where should we go?

875
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,100
- Why would we go to prison... - This is upsetting.

876
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,540
- for stealing some rice cake? - Seriously.

877
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:54,340
(They enter Running Prison at 11am.)

878
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,550
This is a real prison.

879
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,950
It's a real prison.

880
00:32:01,095 --> 00:32:03,090
It feels strange.

881
00:32:03,465 --> 00:32:06,060
- Seriously. - Isn't this a movie set?

882
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:07,830
It is.

883
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:11,020
- Seriously. - I don't want to go inside.

884
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,490
(The place where they're forced into...)

885
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,360
- Do we go in? - Is this the dressing room?

886
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,570
Do we really go in?

887
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,640
All I did was eat a pork cutlet set for lunch.

888
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:20,130
Come this way.

889
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,270
(All members are transferred at 11:10am.)

890
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,270
Goodness.

891
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,150
(All members are transferred at 11:10am.)

892
00:32:26,455 --> 00:32:27,510
(Song Ji Hyo)

893
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,480
(Their personal items and clothes are kept in custody.)

894
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:35,180
- My goodness. - I can't believe we're in prison.

895
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,120
What's happening today?

896
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,260
(What's their first mission?)

897
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:39,920
- What is this? - There's water.

898
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,890
(There are buckets of water.)

899
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:43,460
- What's the water for? - What's going on?

900
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,500
Before we officially start,

901
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:49,030
here's your first mission with a chance to increase or reduce...

902
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,240
your sentence.

903
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:52,600
It's called Wanting to be Forgiven.

904
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,300
(Wanting to be Forgiven)

905
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,780
Confess something you've done wrong to the members.

906
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:00,110
Based on your sincerity,

907
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,110
others will decrease the hours from 0 to 10 minutes.

908
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,950
Your sentence will be reduced by the total number of minutes.

909
00:33:07,095 --> 00:33:08,490
We're the judges.

910
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:11,120
The total is 70 minutes maximum.

911
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
(It can be reduced by 0 to 70 minutes.)

912
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,850
- 70 minutes? - It's over an hour.

913
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,660
- 1 hour? - Your sentence could be 23 hours.

914
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:20,530
Is it a life sentence?

915
00:33:22,245 --> 00:33:23,440
It's 1 night 2 days.

916
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:26,140
- You have to stay here a few days? - What?

917
00:33:26,515 --> 00:33:28,510
- You have to stay here a few days? - What?

918
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,500
Jong Kook will stay here.

919
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,940
- What? - Be careful what you say.

920
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,770
Why did you make that comment?

921
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,780
- She's irritating him. - So Min is irritating him.

922
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:38,850
Let's see.

923
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,720
You will be slapped by water to be forgiven.

924
00:33:42,725 --> 00:33:46,190
If you don't get slapped by water, your sentence will increase.

925
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,790
Kwang Soo.

926
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,520
(To whom will he apologize?)

927
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,820
Kwang Soo has a lot to confess.

928
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,260
After he gets married...

929
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,590
(Booing)

930
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,030
Get lost.

931
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,160
- I spit on you. - What's going on?

932
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,900
- I spit on you. - What?

933
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,240
- You're ugly. - He's a petty criminal.

934
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:02,840
- He's a petty criminal. - Right.

935
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,040
- Your cap looks very cheap. - It's in poop color.

936
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:06,280
His face looks cheap too.

937
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:09,340
What if he cries?

938
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,620
(Are we being too harsh?)

939
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:11,820
I won't play.

940
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,590
I won't.

941
00:34:14,725 --> 00:34:17,280
- He already finished. - Is that it, Kwang Soo?

942
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,260
- Kwang Soo's turn is over. - It's over.

943
00:34:19,895 --> 00:34:24,400
(His turn is over even before he confesses.)

944
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:25,990
I will confess...

945
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,490
(He wants to ask forgiveness to...)

946
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,870
I will confess to So Min.

947
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:34,210
- I haven't told this to anyone. - Okay.

948
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:36,510
After So Min moved to a new place,

949
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:40,280
she couldn't install the blinds.

950
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:43,580
I brought my drill to her house...

951
00:34:43,585 --> 00:34:45,250
and helped her put up the blinds.

952
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:47,320
Why are you asking for forgiveness?

953
00:34:47,355 --> 00:34:49,320
- However, - Did you steal something?

954
00:34:49,395 --> 00:34:50,590
So Min.

955
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:54,330
I cracked the ceiling.

956
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:56,460
I cracked the ceiling.

957
00:34:57,565 --> 00:34:59,890
I'm renting my place.

958
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,270
I'm sorry, but I'm not good at installing blinds.

959
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:03,760
It was harder than I thought.

960
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,170
There are many men like that.

961
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,870
- Just admit that you can't do it. - That's right.

962
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,700
- Suddenly, Kwang Soo said... - Don't pretend to know.

963
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,510
that he felt hot.

964
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:14,740
- He only had on a sleeveless shirt. - Sleeveless?

965
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:19,110
(Sleeveless shirt is the extreme end of being pretentious.)

966
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,280
My goodness.

967
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,420
What are you talking about?

968
00:35:22,595 --> 00:35:24,680
- Shouldn't he be penalized? - What are you talking about?

969
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,920
I wasn't wearing a sleeveless shirt. It's a misunderstanding.

970
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,320
- Kwang Soo wears it often. - No way.

971
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,590
- He took off his shirt. - What do you mean?

972
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,530
- He stretched his arms. - No way.

973
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,900
She's lying.

974
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,800
Stretch your arms like this...

975
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,170
while showing your hair on the belly.

976
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,470
(He punches him.)

977
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,770
- Be quiet. - Okay, Kwang Soo.

978
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:43,810
- Don't talk while older men talk. - Okay.

979
00:35:45,415 --> 00:35:48,310
This is what's funny. He promised to install the blinds.

980
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,480
He went somewhere while the drill was being charged.

981
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,110
- Then he went to Myeongdong. - Why?

982
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,490
- I don't know why. - Why did you go to Myeongdong?

983
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:56,550
I went to eat.

984
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,060
(He answers nonchalantly.)

985
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,420
(Did he go eat by himself?)

986
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,960
I went to eat because I was hungry.

987
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,390
- What about me? - What?

988
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,900
- What about me? - You had no food at home.

989
00:36:07,105 --> 00:36:09,260
What's going on between you two?

990
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
(They act like real siblings.)

991
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,530
- That's strange. - He went to eat?

992
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,700
(They act like real siblings.)

993
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,110
1, 2, 3.

994
00:36:14,145 --> 00:36:16,210
- 10 minutes. - Really?

995
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,300
Is it 65 minutes?

996
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,510
(The total is 65 minutes.)

997
00:36:18,685 --> 00:36:20,070
If his sentence is two hours,

998
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,450
- He gets to leave early. - he gets to leave after an hour.

999
00:36:22,855 --> 00:36:25,280
(I'm sorry, but I don't want to forgive him.)

1000
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,290
- I don't want to forgive him. - Wait.

1001
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,450
That's right, So Min.

1002
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:30,490
That's a good choice.

1003
00:36:30,495 --> 00:36:32,820
- I won't forgive him. - Good job.

1004
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,090
(His sentence increases by 65 minutes.)

1005
00:36:34,895 --> 00:36:37,720
Let's move to the group cell and start your life in prison.

1006
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,760
- Okay. - Okay.

1007
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,230
(Current sentence minutes)

1008
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:42,760
(Imprisonment finally starts.)

1009
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,660
- It looks scary below. - It's scary.

1010
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,200
It's scary below. Don't look down.

1011
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
I can't walk in the middle.

1012
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:49,940
- It's not scary. - Come on.

1013
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Be a man.

1014
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,080
(They move to the group cell.)

1015
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:53,780
It's a group cell.

1016
00:36:53,855 --> 00:36:55,240
It's a real cell.

1017
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,510
(This is...)

1018
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,010
(This is a cell for 8 people.)

1019
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,280
It's a real cell that I only heard of.

1020
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,520
"What the cell leader says is the law."

1021
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,690
(What the cell leader says is the law.)

1022
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,490
- What's this? - It's the restroom.

1023
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:08,460
This must be the restroom.

1024
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:10,600
- Is it a real restroom? - It's divided.

1025
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:13,360
There are toothbrushes for everyone.

1026
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,830
We're really in prison.

1027
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,260
(Basic needs are prepared.)

1028
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
- It's cold in here. - Goodness.

1029
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,300
(They can't leave until they serve their sentence.)

1030
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,440
We can't leave.

1031
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,940
- Really? - We're trapped.

1032
00:37:23,215 --> 00:37:25,240
- It feels suffocating already. - It's cold.

1033
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,980
Gosh, is there a way to escape?

1034
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,910
- There's no way to escape at all. - Seriously.

1035
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,180
Why are there beans and a millstone?

1036
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,350
(Beans and a millstone?)

1037
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,020
(Why are there beans and a millstone in the cell?)

1038
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,550
Why is there a millstone?

1039
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,660
It's a millstone.

1040
00:37:39,665 --> 00:37:44,230
This is the cell where you'll be imprisoned.

1041
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:47,090
There are two ways to reduce your sentence.

1042
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,100
- Okay. - What are they?

1043
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:51,260
Clear a mission and exchange the sentence with a member...

1044
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,570
whom you suspect has less.

1045
00:37:52,945 --> 00:37:54,870
If you make a block of tofu by using the tools,

1046
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,470
your sentence will be reduced by half.

1047
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,200
(If you make tofu, your sentence will be reduced.)

1048
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,250
- A block of tofu? - We have to make tofu?

1049
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,640
(They can't believe what they hear.)

1050
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,310
- Gosh. - Make a block of tofu?

1051
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,410
- Soft tofu? - Is it possible?

1052
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,110
We're doing everything.

1053
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,520
Did you put them here so that we make tofu?

1054
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,520
- How can we? - You make tofu...

1055
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,260
There are instructions on how to make tofu.

1056
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,830
- You're right. - Gosh.

1057
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:18,760
(They can learn how to make tofu in prison.)

1058
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,490
What if it takes 12 hours to make tofu?

1059
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:24,500
- No. - It takes a few hours.

1060
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,530
Use whatever ways to make tofu.

1061
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,670
Then your sentence is reduced by half.

1062
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,180
You may ask someone to bring you tofu as well.

1063
00:38:31,815 --> 00:38:33,150
- Ask someone? - To bring it here?

1064
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:37,920
We need a phone to call someone to bring tofu.

1065
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:42,280
It's up to you to find a way.

1066
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
It's up to us?

1067
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,820
We can't attach a message to a pigeon or anything.

1068
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,960
Should we yell?

1069
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:50,200
Can you go out from there?

1070
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:52,160
Jung Geol!

1071
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,300
(He calls his manager.)

1072
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:55,090
Jung Geol!

1073
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,570
(Do you hear me?)

1074
00:38:56,705 --> 00:38:57,860
Jung Geol!

1075
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,570
(If you can hear me, bring me some tofu.)

1076
00:39:01,415 --> 00:39:03,070
Let's start a riot.

1077
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,070
(Let's start a riot.)

1078
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,640
(We'll attack them instead.)

1079
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,510
Start a riot? That's so much like Jong Kook.

1080
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,510
If a member who finished their sentence comes back with tofu,

1081
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,350
that will be accepted.

1082
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:15,550
- One of us can bring it? - Yes.

1083
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,860
Let's ask one person.

1084
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,460
However, he can only bring one block.

1085
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:22,990
- Some of us will leave soon. - Right.

1086
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,720
- That's true. - If you have two hours...

1087
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,130
- For me... - Save one person if you leave.

1088
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,760
The saved member can save someone else.

1089
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,160
- Then we can all leave. - After two hours...

1090
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,030
- We work as a team? - Would that work?

1091
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:34,200
I don't think so.

1092
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,340
- Someone will betray. - We can help each other.

1093
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,680
And the cell leader has absolute power.

1094
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,840
You must obey the cell leader.

1095
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,980
The cell leader can send the members to the solitary cell.

1096
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,610
(The cell leader can put members in solitary confinement.)

1097
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,120
- That sounds fun. - Do you remember that time?

1098
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,120
He went to the solitary cell, but the cell was the paradise.

1099
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,620
- Right? - That did happen.

1100
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,590
- I was the leader. Do you remember? - Right.

1101
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:59,160
(He was dragged to the solitary cell for infuriating the cell leader,)

1102
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,170
(but it turned out to be paradise.)

1103
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,860
(However, there are 2 solitary cells today.)

1104
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,030
(What kind of secrets are hidden in these solitary cells?)

1105
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,600
Whenever the bell rings, you will vote to select the cell leader,

1106
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,210
- so it may change. - We are going to vote?

1107
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,040
If you vote for me, I'll make...

1108
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,240
- a peaceful environment. - Can you swear to that?

1109
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,340
I won't betray you.

1110
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,740
Ji Hyo never betrays us.

1111
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,110
- You know that, right? - Ji Hyo...

1112
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,890
- Then I'm sorry, but... - We should team up.

1113
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:25,090
- show us a special talent. - Okay.

1114
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:26,690
Dance for us.

1115
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,590
We have no choice here.

1116
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,730
- Show us your dance. - Okay.

1117
00:40:31,905 --> 00:40:32,990
(Seok Jin dances right away.)

1118
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:34,270
There's no music.

1119
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:37,530
(Ambition exudes from his dance.)

1120
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,300
Ji Hyo, you should interrupt him and start dancing.

1121
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,070
(Ji Hyo, the 2nd candidate, starts dancing.)

1122
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,070
(The first cell leader is me, it's me)

1123
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,850
- Ji Hyo, don't forget me. - That's great.

1124
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:47,870
- Okay. - There you go.

1125
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,150
One of them will be the cell leader?

1126
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:51,080
Is this how we're going to vote for the cell leader?

1127
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,350
- Vote now. - Hey.

1128
00:40:52,355 --> 00:40:53,680
- They must be authoritative. - What else can we do?

1129
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,550
- In that case... - You guys are too mean.

1130
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:56,850
This isn't how it is in dramas.

1131
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,220
- They are powerful. - Stop talking.

1132
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,050
- How can cell leaders... - There's no other way.

1133
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,320
- What about recent songs? - Which one knows recent songs?

1134
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,820
Sing the most recent song you know.

1135
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,560
(Sing a recent song among songs you know.)

1136
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,040
(Growl)

1137
00:41:09,045 --> 00:41:11,360
("Growl" by Exo is the title track of their 1st album in 2013.)

1138
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,370
- That's the most recent song? - Growl

1139
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,940
(It sounds like a Korean traditional song.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1140
00:41:16,245 --> 00:41:18,470
- Growl - Growl

1141
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:23,280
(It's a different song. It only shares the same title.)

1142
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,010
Growl

1143
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,850
- Growl - All right.

1144
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:30,920
(It's when "Growl" meets Korean traditional music.)

1145
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,760
Okay. Sing us a more recent song.

1146
00:41:33,465 --> 00:41:35,530
You'll win as long as you don't sing "Chunhyangga".

1147
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:39,200
- I have a song in mind. - Go ahead.

1148
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,940
(For Ji Hyo, "Hot Issue" has been popular for 8 years.)

1149
00:41:44,945 --> 00:41:47,770
(Which song will she sing this time?)

1150
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,540
(Are you leaving me?)

1151
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,140
- Great. - That's it.

1152
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,850
- Ji Hyo, sing a bit more. - You're almost there.

1153
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:56,840
(She sings another line.)

1154
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,980
She got it right.

1155
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,380
(Babbling)

1156
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,890
(She sings it out of nowhere.)

1157
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,190
What are you doing?

1158
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,950
(After babbling...)

1159
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,620
(You can't fool anyone, Ji Hyo.)

1160
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,120
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - What are you doing?

1161
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,390
Is this how you're going to do this?

1162
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,300
(Why does she keep doing this?)

1163
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,940
At that time, he came to her.

1164
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:20,470
All right.

1165
00:42:20,475 --> 00:42:22,370
Should we vote now?

1166
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,680
Which one should I vote for?

1167
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:26,980
(6 members cast their votes to decide the first cell leader.)

1168
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:28,410
- I'll announcement it now. - Okay.

1169
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,280
- One of you will be chosen. - Okay.

1170
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:35,110
(To whom will the honor of becoming the first cell leader go?)

1171
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,420
The first cell leader is...

1172
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:39,550
(1st candidate, Seok Jin, 2nd candidate, Ji Hyo)

1173
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,860
Seok Jin.

1174
00:42:42,065 --> 00:42:44,560
(Seok Jin, the ambitious one, is elected as the cell leader.)

1175
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,660
- Mr. Cell Leader. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1176
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,670
- Get away from me. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1177
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:52,470
- Hey, get away from me. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1178
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:53,670
I love you.

1179
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,200
- Go away. - Mr. Cell Leader.

1180
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,600
(Seok Jin is elected after twists and turns.)

1181
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,510
(What kind of environment will he make for the cell?)

1182
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:02,640
(Remaining sentences)

1183
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,420
He became the cell leader just like the other time.

1184
00:43:06,725 --> 00:43:09,180
Hey, whoever voted for me should sit down.

1185
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,590
- Okay. - You should stand over there.

1186
00:43:10,595 --> 00:43:13,260
- Se Chan, go stand over there. - That's right.

1187
00:43:13,395 --> 00:43:15,890
- Jong Kook, you can sit. - Thank you.

1188
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,960
- Kwang Soo, goodness. - The cell leader...

1189
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:19,660
(The prisoner who's on bad terms with him...)

1190
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,890
- What are you doing? - Move aside.

1191
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,500
(The hated prisoner is forced to turn the millstone.)

1192
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,340
- Do your best. - Hey.

1193
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:27,300
- So Min. - Yes?

1194
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,740
- Sit. - Okay.

1195
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:30,570
- Stand up. - Okay.

1196
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,570
- Whom should you listen to? - Okay.

1197
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,710
Whom should you listen to?

1198
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:35,480
- Seok Jin. - Stand up.

1199
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:38,110
But it looks like Jae Seok is the cell leader.

1200
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:40,750
(But it looks like Jae Seok is the cell leader.)

1201
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,280
Exactly. You should help Seok Jin out.

1202
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,950
- Jae Seok looks like the leader. - You.

1203
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,620
- Jae Seok, you should go first it. - My goodness.

1204
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,620
- You're getting under my skin. - This is...

1205
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,320
- I wasn't trying to do that. - Who is the cell leader here?

1206
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:51,430
We let you become the cell leader.

1207
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:52,890
You "let" me become the leader?

1208
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,490
I was the one who helped you get it.

1209
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,660
- Haha. - Yes?

1210
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,800
- You're off now. - Move.

1211
00:43:57,805 --> 00:43:59,370
- Go grind it. - You'd better move.

1212
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,700
- Grind it. - Come and grind this.

1213
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,370
Do you want to join our gang?

1214
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,700
Yes, I'll serve you for the rest of my life.

1215
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,070
- Go! - Grind it now.

1216
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,210
- Turn the millstone. - How could he change so quickly?

1217
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:08,570
- Is this how you'll play this? - Go work.

1218
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:10,010
- Are you serious? - I told you to grind it.

1219
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,140
This is a bit...

1220
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,410
- Do as you're told. - Goodness.

1221
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,990
(Obey the cell leader.)

1222
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:18,050
- Wait until the next election. - Hey, kid.

1223
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,860
- Kid. - I got it. "Kid"?

1224
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,550
- Take off your glasses. - By the way...

1225
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,330
- Hey, hey. - That little jerk.

1226
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:26,390
I wish you'd be more kind to the cellmates,

1227
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,660
- What did you say? - sir.

1228
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,100
- Send him to the solitary cell. - You should try...

1229
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:31,660
My goodness.

1230
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,300
- I should do that, right? - Yes, it'd be great.

1231
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,940
(Why don't you put him in the solitary cell now?)

1232
00:44:37,245 --> 00:44:38,540
Hey, I was just...

1233
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,810
(Solitary cell)

1234
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:42,110
- Go to the cell. - What?

1235
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,520
- You're scaring me, so go now. - The solitary cell.

1236
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:46,290
- Seriously? - Go to the cell.

1237
00:44:49,695 --> 00:44:51,680
This is power!

1238
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,590
- See if you can get out of here. - My goodness.

1239
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:56,090
You know what? I was curious about the cell anyway.

1240
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,730
I was curious about the solitary cell.

1241
00:44:59,205 --> 00:45:04,800
(So Jong Kook is dragged to the solitary cell.)

1242
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,310
I can't believe he kicked me out to the solitary cell.

1243
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:09,110
I made him the cell leader.

1244
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:13,910
There are two solitary cells.

1245
00:45:13,915 --> 00:45:16,080
Choose the one you like, and enter.

1246
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,580
(He will choose between the 1st and 2nd solitary cell and enter.)

1247
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,680
(The 2 solitary cells give off a creepy vibe.)

1248
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,420
(What secrets lie beyond the doors?)

1249
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,120
I'll choose the Solitary Cell One.

1250
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,720
(Jong Kook chooses the Solitary Cell One.)

1251
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,030
Okay.

1252
00:45:32,935 --> 00:45:36,930
(The door of the Solitary Cell One opens at last.)

1253
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,100
(What is the shocking secret...)

1254
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,570
(Jong Kook will face inside the cell?)

1255
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:44,800
- Hey, guys. Get some rest. - Yes, sir.

1256
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,010
1, 2, 3.

1257
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:47,070
What's this?

1258
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,070
- You already did that much? - Yes.

1259
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:52,990
(The bucket is full of bean extract, ground by the millstone.)

1260
00:45:53,725 --> 00:45:55,190
- Hey. - Ji Hyo has a knack for this.

1261
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:57,150
Ji Hyo is good at cooking too.

1262
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,320
(Master of tofu)

1263
00:45:59,165 --> 00:46:03,230
(When the rest of them were busy settling their ranks...)

1264
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:04,560
I think we can make a block of tofu.

1265
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
- You think so? - I think we can do it, no?

1266
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,400
(Ji Hyo took over the millstone quietly.)

1267
00:46:10,875 --> 00:46:12,740
- I think I am good at this. - Let me help.

1268
00:46:13,215 --> 00:46:14,430
You are good at this.

1269
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,110
We can make tofu with that.

1270
00:46:16,645 --> 00:46:18,570
I think we can make about two blocks of tofu.

1271
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,970
(Can they make tofu and reduce their sentence?)

1272
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,950
- Wait. He's back. - Jong Kook, you're back.

1273
00:46:22,955 --> 00:46:24,110
Look at him.

1274
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,320
- Did you get splashed? - What happened?

1275
00:46:26,855 --> 00:46:28,150
(What goes on in the solitary cell?)

1276
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,090
- What is it? What happened? - He's staring at Seok Jin only.

1277
00:46:30,465 --> 00:46:31,850
He's only looking at Seok Jin.

1278
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,120
What on earth happened?

1279
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,090
(He came back wet. What happened in the solitary cell?)

1280
00:46:35,135 --> 00:46:37,060
I elected you as cell leader.

1281
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:38,220
Seok Jin.

1282
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,200
- What happens in there? - His pants are completely wet.

1283
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:42,570
Hey, Jong Kook.

1284
00:46:42,705 --> 00:46:43,930
I only...

1285
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,030
sent you there because the cell leader...

1286
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,010
I sent you there because I thought it was a paradise.

1287
00:46:48,145 --> 00:46:50,570
Did you just put your hand on me?

1288
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,350
(He's startled.)

1289
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:55,640
- Get some rest. - Rest up.

1290
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,050
(The bell rings.)

1291
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,020
- Everyone. - We'll change our cell leader.

1292
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,250
- Okay. - Give it back.

1293
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:04,490
All right. You will elect a new cell leader.

1294
00:47:04,665 --> 00:47:07,060
Everyone, please help me win the next term.

1295
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:10,290
The second cell leader has been voted.

1296
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:11,960
- It's Jong Kook. - Seok Jin.

1297
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,990
(Seok Jin's era is over.)

1298
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,270
Face the wall.

1299
00:47:15,975 --> 00:47:17,260
(Of course, I should face the wall.)

1300
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,740
- "Face the wall". - That's so downgrading.

1301
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,570
He sounded so serious. My goodness.

1302
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,740
(I'm all right.)

1303
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,340
(The cell leader's word is law.)

1304
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,020
With the incumbent cell leader, you will complete...

1305
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:34,250
- a mission for a Chance Card. - Okay.

1306
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,120
- It's the Voice of the Scene. - "The scene"?

1307
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,180
(A Chance Card is at stake.)

1308
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,220
You will listen to the intro of a randomly chosen film.

1309
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,230
If you guess the film in order, the mission is successful.

1310
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:44,390
- It's about films? - Whoever guesses...

1311
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,260
the most films will receive the Chance Card.

1312
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,330
(The winning member can acquire a Switch Card.)

1313
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:52,530
(Which 1 of these members will obtain the Switch Card?)

1314
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,010
You can come up with the order to guess the films now.

1315
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:58,200
It may be advantageous if you go first...

1316
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,340
or go last.

1317
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,680
This... Tell you what, Jong Kook.

1318
00:48:00,685 --> 00:48:02,350
Listening to the beginning of the film won't be advantageous.

1319
00:48:02,355 --> 00:48:03,910
So start with Jae Seok,

1320
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,340
- then Kwang Soo. - No, you shouldn't.

1321
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,910
- Make them go first. - You should go sixth.

1322
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:09,180
- There are eight of us. - Okay.

1323
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,280
- Going fourth is good. It raises... - Okay.

1324
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,290
- your chance. - Seok Jin will go first.

1325
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,090
(Okay. Seok Jin will go 1st.)

1326
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:17,960
- Jae Seok will go second. - Okay.

1327
00:48:18,405 --> 00:48:19,800
- Kwang Soo, you're third. - What about...

1328
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:21,900
You should go fourth.

1329
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:23,630
Going fourth isn't that bad.

1330
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,740
(Let me think.)

1331
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:28,340
(What about me?)

1332
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,910
I'll go fourth.

1333
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:32,840
So Min wasn't chosen.

1334
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,370
- She won't go in the beginning. - The fifth place...

1335
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,480
The member in fifth place is likely to guess the correct answer.

1336
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,020
- Haha. - Thank you, Jong Kook.

1337
00:48:38,355 --> 00:48:40,280
- That's not fair. - It's not fair at all.

1338
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,650
You favor Haha the most.

1339
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:42,850
I'll go 5th, and he'll go 6th.

1340
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,390
After Se Chan,

1341
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:46,450
Ji Hyo will go.

1342
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,790
Isn't it nice?

1343
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,190
So Min is last.

1344
00:48:49,335 --> 00:48:50,620
So Min...

1345
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:52,760
You won't even give her a chance.

1346
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,030
- Right. - It will be the hardest for her.

1347
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:57,070
All right. I'll play the film for the first quiz.

1348
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:59,930
The traffic jam during the morning rush hour has completely subsided.

1349
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:03,670
(It's from the first film.)

1350
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,970
This is bad.

1351
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,350
I think I know which film it is.

1352
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:08,750
This is...

1353
00:49:09,085 --> 00:49:10,410
I bet...

1354
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,380
- it's a disaster film. - Five.

1355
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:14,790
It's a disaster film or a film with a monster.

1356
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,420
I know the answer.

1357
00:49:17,725 --> 00:49:19,090
"The Host".

1358
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:21,320
- "The Host". - "The Host".

1359
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,690
"The Host" directed by Bong Joon Ho.

1360
00:49:23,265 --> 00:49:24,490
(That's incorrect.)

1361
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:25,890
(That was close.)

1362
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,430
That wasn't even close.

1363
00:49:27,435 --> 00:49:28,660
I'll give you the next line.

1364
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,900
- Play the film. - It won't be my turn anytime soon.

1365
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,440
The traffic is smooth on Dongbu and Seobu Expressway.

1366
00:49:33,745 --> 00:49:35,370
- It's a traffic report. - Hold on.

1367
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,940
Traffic is moderate on Dongbu Expressway and Seobu Expressway.

1368
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:39,370
Is this traffic radio?

1369
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,870
- Hold on. - Is this supposed to be a movie?

1370
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:44,740
- This is... - I might have a chance.

1371
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,550
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1372
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:53,820
Okay. Whose turn is it now?

1373
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,850
It's my turn.

1374
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:57,290
Play the next line.

1375
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,120
On Gangbyeon Expressway and Olympic Expressway,

1376
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,890
traffic looks good all the way...

1377
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:03,000
from Cheonho Bridge to Banghwa Bridge.

1378
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:06,430
- That was short. - Isn't this just traffic radio?

1379
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,530
(What is this movie?)

1380
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:09,170
- "The Tunnel". - I think that's right.

1381
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,680
("The Tunnel")

1382
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:15,110
(Is it correct?)

1383
00:50:15,155 --> 00:50:16,480
I was thinking of that one too.

1384
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,910
- It's wrong? - It's wrong?

1385
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,610
(Kwang Soo is wrong.)

1386
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,280
I thought it was correct.

1387
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,280
- Really? - I was thinking of that one too.

1388
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,050
- Ha Jung Woo is in it. - Ha Jung Woo is in it.

1389
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,790
I thought it was "The Tunnel".

1390
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,760
Here goes the next line.

1391
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:31,390
There's another piece of news.

1392
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:33,330
(I know it.)

1393
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,970
Another piece of news?

1394
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,730
I don't remember the title.

1395
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,510
Ha Jung Woo is in it.

1396
00:50:41,545 --> 00:50:43,340
In the radio booth...

1397
00:50:43,645 --> 00:50:45,840
I watched that movie.

1398
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,140
- 5, 4, - Hold on.

1399
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:50,280
- 3, 2... - That's too fast.

1400
00:50:50,285 --> 00:50:51,880
(Surprised)

1401
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,620
Don't count down so fast.

1402
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:56,760
- 100, 99, - Hold on.

1403
00:50:56,795 --> 00:50:59,020
- 98, 97... - 98, 97...

1404
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,550
It's supposed to be two syllables...

1405
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,690
No.

1406
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,760
- No. - "The Terror Live".

1407
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,590
("The Terror Live")

1408
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:08,000
"The Terror Live".

1409
00:51:08,475 --> 00:51:09,660
(Correct)

1410
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,030
I knew it too.

1411
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,930
- I knew it too. - I can't believe I remembered it.

1412
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:14,640
I knew it too.

1413
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:21,340
(The movie starts with a traffic announcement.)

1414
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,910
(It's a thriller movie starring Ha Jung Woo.)

1415
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:29,690
(Congratulations, Jong Kook.)

1416
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,020
- Do you remember it now? - Yes.

1417
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,120
- "The Terror Live". - Now, I remember it.

1418
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,960
- Here we go. - I'll get it right this time.

1419
00:51:37,665 --> 00:51:38,890
- Start. - Ghosts...

1420
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,030
(The second question)

1421
00:51:40,675 --> 00:51:41,860
I know it.

1422
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:42,930
(Roaring)

1423
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,300
No resort in bird sanctuary!

1424
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,500
I know this one.

1425
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,200
(No resort in bird sanctuary!)

1426
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,140
- I know this one. - What is this?

1427
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:53,610
- Gosh. - I know it.

1428
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:55,970
You have to know this.

1429
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,010
- Haha. - It's obvious.

1430
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,550
- What? - Yes.

1431
00:51:59,555 --> 00:52:01,410
- "1987: When the Day Comes". - Gosh.

1432
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,180
- What are you talking about? - "1987: When the Day Comes"?

1433
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,790
It's still showing at cinemas.

1434
00:52:05,795 --> 00:52:08,090
There's no way they'd play it here.

1435
00:52:08,235 --> 00:52:10,030
- Kwang Soo. - The next line.

1436
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:12,160
- Play it. - I want to get it right.

1437
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,390
The title is...

1438
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:14,390
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1439
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,500
- Withdraw! - Withdraw!

1440
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:20,670
They repeated the same word.

1441
00:52:22,415 --> 00:52:24,770
If I tell you the answer,

1442
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:27,470
- can you move me up? - They repeated the same word.

1443
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,480
- Okay. - I'm serious.

1444
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:33,280
Can you discuss with others?

1445
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,320
5, 4, 3,

1446
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:36,950
- 2, 1. - 2, 1.

1447
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,150
"A Violent Prosecutor".

1448
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:44,100
("A Violent Prosecutor")

1449
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:45,460
It's correct.

1450
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,030
I was right.

1451
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:50,400
I was right. Move me up two spots.

1452
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,430
- Move me up. - Okay.

1453
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,660
- It's with Gang Dong Won. - Okay.

1454
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,740
I knew it was the one with Gang Dong Won.

1455
00:52:56,145 --> 00:53:03,110
(The movie starts with a protest to protect a bird sanctuary.)

1456
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:08,820
(So Min was very impressed by Gang Dong Won's swindler role.)

1457
00:53:09,595 --> 00:53:12,120
- Can you move me up? - Which place do you want?

1458
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,590
Me?

1459
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,220
The one before you.

1460
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,430
The one before me? Okay.

1461
00:53:17,435 --> 00:53:19,360
Wait. Is that tofu?

1462
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
- Tofu arrived. - What?

1463
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,530
(Tofu arrived?)

1464
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,530
(Tofu arrived.)

1465
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:27,940
Tofu arrived.

1466
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:29,670
How did it get here?

1467
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:32,870
- Tofu? How did it get here? - How did it get here?

1468
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,210
(How did the tofu get here?)

1469
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,010
It's for Jong Kook.

1470
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,240
How did it get here?

1471
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,280
- It's for Jong Kook. - How did it get here?

1472
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,320
What happened?

1473
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:46,920
- Okay. - How did he do it?

1474
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,630
- I'm so relieved. - You should eat it.

1475
00:53:48,635 --> 00:53:52,200
Did you make it in the solitary cell?

1476
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:53,730
He must have done something.

1477
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,660
- He must've carried out a mission. - He must have made it there.

1478
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,240
Send me to the solitary cell.

1479
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:02,170
(What happens in the solitary cell?)

1480
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:03,270
There must be something...

1481
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:04,710
in the solitary cell.

1482
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:08,070
(What's the secret of the solitary cells?)

1483
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,280
Number eight.

1484
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:12,010
Send me to the solitary cell now.

1485
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,720
Can I send someone to the solitary cell?

1486
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,920
- Yes. - Send me now.

1487
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:18,060
Guys, there's more than one solitary cell.

1488
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:19,120
You should know that.

1489
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,950
- That's up to you. - Right.

1490
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,620
- The solitary cell... - You wanted to go.

1491
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,990
See you.

1492
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:25,820
Thank you. I'll see you in a while.

1493
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:27,760
- See you. - Go to the solitary cell.

1494
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,530
(Haha is looking forward to winning tofu.)

1495
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:31,900
Hello.

1496
00:54:32,445 --> 00:54:33,840
I'm a model prisoner.

1497
00:54:34,315 --> 00:54:36,670
Please choose between...

1498
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,040
the two solitary cells.

1499
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,040
(Haha has to choose.)

1500
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,450
(Let me see.)

1501
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:44,640
I choose number two.

1502
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,240
- Okay. Please go in. - Okay.

1503
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,890
(Haha chooses number 2 unlike Jong Kook.)

1504
00:54:49,895 --> 00:54:53,950
(What's in solitary cell number 2?)

1505
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,230
What's that?

1506
00:54:57,065 --> 00:54:59,500
What's that? Wait.

1507
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:01,970
(Pots?)

1508
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:05,160
(Let me sit down.)

1509
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,170
You're in the solitary cell with pots.

1510
00:55:10,315 --> 00:55:12,140
You'll be splashed with water.

1511
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:13,510
That's it?

1512
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:17,310
That's it?

1513
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,120
(Really?)

1514
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:20,910
What's going on?

1515
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,890
Please splash the water. 1, 2, 3.

1516
00:55:24,895 --> 00:55:27,720
(Splash)

1517
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,330
(Soaked)

1518
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:34,360
(Can I get tofu now?)

1519
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,000
You can go back now.

1520
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:41,610
(That's it?)

1521
00:55:41,615 --> 00:55:43,200
(All this cell has are pots.)

1522
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,440
Gosh.

1523
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:47,710
What is this? Jong Kook took a lot longer.

1524
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:49,570
(What was in the solitary cell Jong Kook went to?)

1525
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,450
- I choose number one. - Okay.

1526
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:58,390
(What was in solitary cell number 1?)

1527
00:55:59,495 --> 00:56:04,030
(Spend some time alone in the cozy solitary cell.)

1528
00:56:04,035 --> 00:56:05,760
(You can take a break from the cold and hunger here.)

1529
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,370
I thought I'd be penalized.

1530
00:56:10,045 --> 00:56:11,640
(This is nice.)

1531
00:56:12,605 --> 00:56:13,800
There's a phone.

1532
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,470
(There's a cell phone?)

1533
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,540
Can I use it?

1534
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,240
(He can talk to someone outside.)

1535
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,110
- Hello. - Deok Jin.

1536
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,380
- This is Jong Kook. - Hi.

1537
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:27,220
Can you get me some tofu?

1538
00:56:27,825 --> 00:56:29,450
Excuse me.

1539
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,780
- Do you have tofu? - Yes.

1540
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,790
- Please give this to Jong Kook. - Okay.

1541
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,030
- Tell him he can take his time. - Okay.

1542
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:39,260
(After secretly asking for tofu...)

1543
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,530
Is there some water?

1544
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:42,130
Please give me some water.

1545
00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:46,970
(He wets his clothes to deceive others.)

1546
00:56:46,975 --> 00:56:50,100
(This way, they won't suspect anything.)

1547
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:53,710
(That's how he had tofu delivered.)

1548
00:56:54,685 --> 00:56:56,880
Is this all?

1549
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,680
Wait.

1550
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,780
(I don't believe it.)

1551
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,020
Hold on.

1552
00:57:01,125 --> 00:57:03,050
Let me go to cell number one.

1553
00:57:03,195 --> 00:57:05,220
Please let me go to a solitary cell.

1554
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,690
Let me go.

1555
00:57:06,995 --> 00:57:08,760
Let me go to a solitary cell!

1556
00:57:09,435 --> 00:57:10,960
Please!

1557
00:57:11,905 --> 00:57:13,120
(Haha only got penalized.)

1558
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,660
- Haha is back. - Ji Hyo.

1559
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,930
Please send me one more time.

1560
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,860
What did you do?

1561
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,200
Please send me one more time.

1562
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:21,430
Right now.

1563
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:22,570
- No. - No?

1564
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,010
- What happened? - Please send me one more time.

1565
00:57:25,185 --> 00:57:26,780
Hit me once.

1566
00:57:28,085 --> 00:57:29,140
(Kicking)

1567
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,350
Go to the solitary cell.

1568
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:32,550
Go to the solitary cell.

1569
00:57:32,725 --> 00:57:34,110
Haha will go to...

1570
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,950
- the solitary cell. - What's going on?

1571
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,750
- What's there? - Ji Hyo.

1572
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,960
(I'll choose cell number 1 this time.)

1573
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,460
Cell number one.

1574
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:43,220
- Between the 2 cells... - I choose number 1.

1575
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:47,130
(He chooses number 1 without hesitation.)

1576
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,530
(Angry)

1577
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,430
Hey!

1578
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:56,340
(Why are the pots here again?)

1579
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,710
(The cells switch all the time.)

1580
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,450
(Gosh, I'm so unlucky.)

1581
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:09,090
(Splash)

1582
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:13,360
(He's splashed for the 2nd time.)

1583
00:58:15,135 --> 00:58:16,820
I'll be right back.

1584
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:18,120
(Angry)

1585
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,030
(Haha only got splashed with water.)

1586
00:58:22,105 --> 00:58:25,030
Let's continue with the quiz.

1587
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:26,030
- Okay. - Okay.

1588
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,170
Before that,

1589
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:30,940
- Se Chan will be released. - Okay!

1590
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,910
- Why? - Okay!

1591
00:58:32,915 --> 00:58:34,380
- Se Chan will be released. - Yes!

1592
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:39,410
(Every member picked a sentence card.)

1593
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:42,910
(Se Chan's sentence was only 3 hours.)

1594
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,390
(It's not bad.)

1595
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:48,830
(His sentence even got reduced by 70 minutes.)

1596
00:58:50,435 --> 00:58:53,160
(Se Chan is released...)

1597
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,490
(after serving his sentence.)

1598
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:56,530
- Yes! - Has it been two hours?

1599
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,430
- Please get me tofu. - Was his sentence two hours?

1600
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,440
Please get me tofu.

1601
00:59:00,715 --> 00:59:03,840
- Please. - Everyone, worship me!

1602
00:59:04,015 --> 00:59:05,070
Se Chan.

1603
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:06,440
- Everyone, - I won't ask for more.

1604
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,470
- serve me. - Please.

1605
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:09,480
Please change.

1606
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:10,640
- Is he really getting out? - You can go.

1607
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,810
Can I really go?

1608
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:12,980
Can I go home?

1609
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,350
Yes!

1610
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,820
I could come back with tofu, right?

1611
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:17,350
I should go back to tofu-making.

1612
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,660
Worship Se Chan

1613
00:59:19,665 --> 00:59:21,320
- Please. - I'll remember you.

1614
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,690
- Guys. - Se Chan.

1615
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:25,360
- So Min, you've been so quiet. - Se Chan!

1616
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,630
- You... - Have a good life.

1617
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,130
Live for yourself. Don't ever come back here.

1618
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,670
What are you talking about?

1619
00:59:33,375 --> 00:59:35,410
I don't believe you.

1620
00:59:35,415 --> 00:59:37,870
Take care of yourself first. Goodness.

1621
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:39,880
Don't come back to this dirty place.

1622
00:59:39,885 --> 00:59:41,710
Go live a happy life, punk.

1623
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:50,090
(He leaves prison without lingering feelings.)

1624
00:59:51,395 --> 00:59:55,390
(The mission to win Chance Cards starts.)

1625
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,760
Who will win the card?

1626
00:59:57,765 --> 00:59:59,960
Play the movie.

1627
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,100
(Third movie plays.)

1628
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,230
(A door opens.)

1629
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:11,370
(Sound of heels clacking on the floor)

1630
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:15,240
(The sound continues. Gosh, it's nice to meet you, ma'am.)

1631
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,780
It's nice to meet you, ma'am.

1632
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:21,650
(Jong Kook is 1st, Ji Hyo is 2nd, and Jae Seok is 3rd.)

1633
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:24,920
(I think I recognize the movie.)

1634
01:00:25,865 --> 01:00:27,450
(If Jong Kook is wrong, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok get a chance.)

1635
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,490
Goodness.

1636
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,960
(If Jong Kook is wrong, Ji Hyo and Jae Seok get a chance.)

1637
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,130
What's your answer?

1638
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:34,330
"The Thieves"?

1639
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:35,930
(He makes a guess.)

1640
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:39,860
(If he's correct, Jong Kook wins.)

1641
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,010
"The Thieves".

1642
01:00:41,915 --> 01:00:43,200
- That's right. - Is that correct?

1643
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,770
("The Thieves" is correct.)

1644
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,980
That's what I thought at first. I knew it.

1645
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:53,780
(It's a scene from "The Thieves"...)

1646
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:58,690
(where Jun Ji Hyun and Shin Ha Kyun meet.)

1647
01:01:01,065 --> 01:01:02,360
Did Jong Kook win?

1648
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,860
I have to switch with someone.

1649
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:08,160
One of you will be released very soon.

1650
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,370
Really?

1651
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:16,370
(Jong Kook's life will change if he switches with this member.)

1652
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,970
- Is it three hours? - This is your chance.

1653
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:19,040
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

1654
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,280
- It's worth it to try. - You can switch with me.

1655
01:01:21,315 --> 01:01:26,780
By the way, why are you so quiet, So Min?

1656
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,550
- Wait a minute. - What?

1657
01:01:28,955 --> 01:01:30,490
- Listen. - Can we leave?

1658
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,220
- So Min? - She's so quiet.

1659
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,120
- So Min is... - Isn't she so calm?

1660
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,160
- She seems disconnected from us. - Right.

1661
01:01:37,165 --> 01:01:39,160
- She's so quiet. - She's not saying much at all.

1662
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,400
She sympathizes with you because she's being released soon.

1663
01:01:43,435 --> 01:01:44,760
So Min.

1664
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,500
(He chooses So Min.)

1665
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,610
- Jong Kook switched... - No way.

1666
01:01:49,615 --> 01:01:51,710
- No. - his sentence with So Min.

1667
01:01:51,915 --> 01:01:53,470
(Jong Kook and So Min are enemies.)

1668
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,640
(They switch their sentences.)

1669
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,210
- All right. - I'm curious.

1670
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,580
The two of you will check your sentences after switching.

1671
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:00,980
We'll turn our backs.

1672
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,150
(What was So Min's sentence?)

1673
01:02:02,895 --> 01:02:04,590
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

1674
01:02:05,795 --> 01:02:06,850
What's wrong?

1675
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,360
(Did you read my sentence?)

1676
01:02:10,165 --> 01:02:11,830
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1677
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,260
My goodness.

1678
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,860
(Her sentence is 10 hours.)

1679
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,930
- I can make 20 blocks of tofu. - My sentence is...

1680
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:19,240
Let's see.

1681
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:23,070
(What was Jong Kook's sentence?)

1682
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:26,609
- I can make 20 blocks of tofu. - My sentence is...

1683
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:31,414
(It was 10 minutes.)

1684
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:37,286
(So Min gets 2 hours of sentence.)

1685
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,890
She started making tofu.

1686
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,558
- Why are you making tofu? - Why?

1687
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,160
Why is she making tofu?

1688
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,129
- She's suddenly making tofu. - She wouldn't make tofu.

1689
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,031
I got goosebumps.

1690
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,365
What happened?

1691
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:52,135
- What happened? - What is it?

1692
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:53,169
What happened?

1693
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:56,506
My goodness.

1694
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,408
- What's going on? - What happened?

1695
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,810
What happened? Why are you about to cry?

1696
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,779
What happened? Is it good or bad?

1697
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,847
- What happened? - Ji Hyo.

1698
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,250
- Please send me back once more. - I want...

1699
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,885
- Please. - I want to go to the solitary cell.

1700
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:10,953
- Do it before I hit you. - Are you the cell leader?

1701
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,288
Please send me once more.

1702
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:13,823
- That's a threat. - It's a threat.

1703
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:14,891
- That's a threat. - Yes.

1704
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,759
- Don't send him. - Please just once.

1705
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:18,861
- Don't send him. - It's the last time.

1706
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:21,030
I won't ask for it anymore.

1707
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,031
(A whistle blows.)

1708
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:23,299
- What? - Jong Kook is released.

1709
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,700
(Jong Kook is released.)

1710
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:25,768
(Laughing)

1711
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,204
- Really? - His sentence was three hours.

1712
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,572
It was him.

1713
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:31,808
- That's why... - Is this possible?

1714
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,177
- you made tofu, didn't you? - This is real victory.

1715
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:38,014
(Thanks to So Min, he's the 2nd to be released.)

1716
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,215
(Thanks to you, I can smell the fresh air.)

1717
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:40,883
- Goodbye, So Min. - Jong Kook can hit Haha.

1718
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,885
- Be happy, Jong Kook. - I will.

1719
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,521
Don't we get another chance?

1720
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,291
Is the four-hour sentence next?

1721
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,993
There's one more mission left.

1722
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,161
- One more. - Is that so?

1723
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,996
Until...

1724
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,033
6pm...

1725
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:58,301
(The one who has the most by 6pm must serve their sentence.)

1726
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,535
Unless something changes,

1727
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,438
the person who has the longest sentence by 6pm...

1728
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:06,509
will serve the entire sentence. Then they'll get a self-bath.

1729
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:08,111
That will be So Min.

1730
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:09,479
- Don't leave me. - It's So Min.

1731
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:10,613
You have a chance to switch.

1732
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,181
We have a chance, right?

1733
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,850
(Who will win the last Switch Card?)

1734
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,485
- I still have a chance. - If someone brings you tofu...

1735
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:17,453
Why do you keep making tofu?

1736
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,390
From the back, she looks like a tofu expert.

1737
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,692
(She's almost like a tofu expert.)

1738
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:26,262
She has bits of beans on her. Doesn't she?

1739
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,563
(She has a 10-hour sentence.)

1740
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,466
Is it colder outside?

1741
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:31,767
It's chilly.

1742
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,303
It's cold.

1743
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:36,906
(They get to exercise outside.)

1744
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,008
- It's very cold. - It's been a long time.

1745
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,109
(Kwang Soo is moved.)

1746
01:04:40,109 --> 01:04:41,577
I haven't been out in so long.

1747
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:43,012
There's sunlight.

1748
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,348
(They almost forgot about the warm sunlight.)

1749
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,250
It's good to be outside.

1750
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,851
He's trying to escape.

1751
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,386
(He runs fast.)

1752
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:51,654
You could get shot.

1753
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,124
(How dare he try to escape?)

1754
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:56,859
(I was only jogging.)

1755
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,494
This is great.

1756
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:00,263
(So Min approaches the producer.)

1757
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,398
- Wait. - What is it?

1758
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,101
Kwang Soo was about to steal it. I'll keep it here for now.

1759
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,802
(It's her precious tofu.)

1760
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,972
(While the others were playing,)

1761
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,041
(she turned the millstone.)

1762
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,442
(She kept turning it...)

1763
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,744
(and worked hard.)

1764
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,513
(So Min completed a block of tofu.)

1765
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,182
(Please protect my tofu.)

1766
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:22,051
Among us, who has the least...

1767
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,386
amount of sentence?

1768
01:05:23,686 --> 01:05:25,922
- I can't tell you. - Really?

1769
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,623
I bet it's Kwang Soo.

1770
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,091
- It's Kwang Soo. - What?

1771
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:31,494
- I bet it's Kwang Soo. - It's either Kwang Soo or Seok Jin.

1772
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,262
I think it's you.

1773
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,363
(I doubt it.)

1774
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,933
Will Jong Kook bring some tofu?

1775
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:39,569
- I think he left with Se Chan. - Why doesn't he?

1776
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:40,570
He's not bringing back tofu.

1777
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,572
(Who will be released next?)

1778
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:46,075
Here's the mission for the last Chance Card.

1779
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:50,112
- It's Red Light, Green Light. - What is it?

1780
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,081
(Red Light, Green Light)

1781
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,283
The one who will be It...

1782
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,253
is our new producer who was a drill instructor in the military.

1783
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,254
(He's the new producer.)

1784
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,422
- A drill instructor? - Really?

1785
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:00,690
(It's nice to meet you.)

1786
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:02,491
- He used to be a drill instructor. - Hello.

1787
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,528
He'll give you an order before saying "Red Light, Green Light".

1788
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,965
If he gives an order of two people looking at each other,

1789
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,334
you must look at each other to not be eliminated.

1790
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,804
Either tap him and come back to the safety line,

1791
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,006
or be the last person to survive.

1792
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,642
- That's how you win. - I'll win.

1793
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,345
You must choose a partner who won't betray.

1794
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:23,679
- Right. - I'll play with Ji Hyo.

1795
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,015
- You know that I won't betray. - I want to play with her too.

1796
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,583
You know that I won't betray.

1797
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,252
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo, let's play.

1798
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:31,520
Let's cooperate until the end.

1799
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,423
- I don't want to play with him. - I have to survive.

1800
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,359
- Me neither. - Do you promise me?

1801
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:37,360
I'll support you.

1802
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,595
Here is some tofu

1803
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,130
(It's a surprise.)

1804
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,999
- Se Chan! - Hey.

1805
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,270
(Have you been waiting? I brought tofu to save you.)

1806
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,171
(It's tofu. No, it's Se Chan.)

1807
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,239
Se Chan!

1808
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,407
(It's tofu. No, it's Se Chan.)

1809
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:54,810
Here is some fresh tofu

1810
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,614
(Fresh tofu will reduce their sentence by half.)

1811
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,916
(That's mine.)

1812
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,385
- Se Chan. - Se Chan.

1813
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,787
(So Min loses her slippers.)

1814
01:07:05,921 --> 01:07:08,491
(Give that to me, Se Chan.)

1815
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:10,626
- Here's some tofu. - Se Chan.

1816
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:11,761
- Hey. - Se Chan.

1817
01:07:11,761 --> 01:07:13,362
- Se Chan. - Here's some tofu.

1818
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,632
(Se Chan plays hard to get with his tofu.)

1819
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,034
- Pass it to me. - Se Chan.

1820
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,235
- Come here. - It's tofu.

1821
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,269
(Follow me if you want it.)

1822
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:21,704
- Here's some tofu. - Se Chan, please.

1823
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,372
Give me some tofu.

1824
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:27,877
Se Chan, look at me. I was too excited to see you.

1825
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:29,111
I was excited to see you.

1826
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,413
(Her feet are covered with mud.)

1827
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,015
It's not because you're excited to see me.

1828
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:35,284
- Your shoes are too big. - Right.

1829
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,652
I'm desperate.

1830
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:37,787
(I'm desperate for tofu.)

1831
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:38,921
I'm desperate.

1832
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,524
- Prisoners. - Yes, sir.

1833
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:42,858
I can't hear you. Prisoners!

1834
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,026
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

1835
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,395
- That's not enough. Sit down. - Yes, sir!

1836
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,597
- Please, sir. - Se Chan.

1837
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,900
One of us will get to leave soon.

1838
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:51,901
Give it to me.

1839
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:55,571
(Give the tofu to me.)

1840
01:07:56,272 --> 01:08:01,143
(I want to go out into the world with that tofu.)

1841
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:02,278
Move back.

1842
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:05,247
(He becomes authoritative.)

1843
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:08,351
You're funny. That was hilarious.

1844
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,219
Se Chan, it was a funny comment.

1845
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,520
- Unbelievable. - I'm serious.

1846
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,622
Everyone has their reasons.

1847
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,292
- How about this? - What?

1848
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,462
Hide the tofu somewhere on the second floor.

1849
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,630
- The first to find it gets it. - That's a good idea.

1850
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,332
- That's not a bad idea. - Right?

1851
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:26,402
Please fix Kwang Soo's microphone.

1852
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:29,071
(Kwang Soo's microphone falls out.)

1853
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,007
- It fell off. - Let's leave him out.

1854
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,275
- What? - Leave him out.

1855
01:08:33,342 --> 01:08:36,212
What does it have to do with my microphone falling off?

1856
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,781
(The battery in the microphone is being changed.)

1857
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,316
- How... - Get lost.

1858
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,517
Why would I?

1859
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:44,253
- You didn't take care of yourself. - He didn't take care of himself.

1860
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:45,554
Haha is right.

1861
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,022
- What do you mean? - You didn't take care of yourself.

1862
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,624
- Line up after Jae Seok. - Okay.

1863
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,526
Jae Seok, Haha,

1864
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,728
- and Ji Hyo. - He didn't take care of himself.

1865
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:55,264
Am I excluded?

1866
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:57,700
(Pushing)

1867
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:02,037
(He takes his anger out on a staff member.)

1868
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:06,342
(Things likes this only happen to Kwang Soo.)

1869
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:07,676
Am I excluded?

1870
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,145
(Gosh)

1871
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,814
I'll hide it on the second floor.

1872
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,049
- Finders keepers. - Okay.

1873
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:16,318
Kwang Soo will be excluded. Seok Jin...

1874
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:17,820
- and So Min are included. - Thank you.

1875
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,355
- I'll be fast. - Okay.

1876
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,690
(I'll find it and reduce my sentence to half.)

1877
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,359
- It starts as soon as I come out. - Okay.

1878
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:26,829
Some people might get released right away with that.

1879
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,197
I bet some people will.

1880
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,500
(While Se Chan hides the tofu, they play a game.)

1881
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,768
Should we start playing a game?

1882
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:34,303
Yes, let's play Red Light, Green Light.

1883
01:09:34,303 --> 01:09:36,372
If I find that and make tofu,

1884
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:38,007
my sentences becomes one-fourth?

1885
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,775
You have to try your best, Kwang Soo.

1886
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:41,610
I'll risk my life. All right.

1887
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:44,013
- Be my partner, So Min. - Okay, I like that.

1888
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,614
- Be my partner, Seok Jin. - Okay.

1889
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,583
- We'll both be fine. - Okay.

1890
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,351
- Let's go. - Okay.

1891
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:50,686
Let's get started.

1892
01:09:50,986 --> 01:09:52,922
Lie down on the ground.

1893
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,356
Red light, green light

1894
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:58,060
(Lie down on the ground.)

1895
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,396
(Collapsing)

1896
01:10:00,396 --> 01:10:01,597
Seok Jin is out.

1897
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:04,533
I'm sorry.

1898
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,503
(He pretended to lie down.)

1899
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:10,172
- Seok Jin is out. - I'm sorry.

1900
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,074
- You're out. - Goodness.

1901
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,910
Haha went on his belly.

1902
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,579
- No, I looked to my side. - He went on his belly.

1903
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,113
- He went on his belly. - He did.

1904
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:19,315
Haha is out.

1905
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,449
(He's in an awkward position.)

1906
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,252
Ji Hyo is on her side!

1907
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:26,121
He never said to lie on your back. You just need to lie down.

1908
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:28,190
- Are we done? - Yes.

1909
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:30,559
- We should have another chance. - Go in when Se Chan comes out.

1910
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,895
Next command.

1911
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:35,030
Put your arms around each other's shoulders.

1912
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,398
Red light, green light

1913
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,134
(Put your arms around each other's shoulders.)

1914
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,135
I didn't hear that.

1915
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,770
I'm your partner.

1916
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:43,606
(Arguing)

1917
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:44,807
Jae Seok.

1918
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,542
(They're still near the start line.)

1919
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,144
- Jae Seok. - We have to go forward.

1920
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,714
- Jae Seok. - Next instruction.

1921
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,716
Make a sexy pose.

1922
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,251
Red light, green light

1923
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,153
(Make a sexy pose.)

1924
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,190
(They try their best to be sexy.)

1925
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:02,691
So Min is not sexy.

1926
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:04,860
(He picks on So Min.)

1927
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:09,832
(How's this? Is this sexy?)

1928
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,402
(I approve.)

1929
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:16,205
(4th instruction)

1930
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:19,775
Grab each other by the collar. Red light, green light

1931
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:22,711
(Grab each other by the collar.)

1932
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,749
(Grabbing)

1933
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:28,083
We have to go forward.

1934
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,885
Get into a push-up position.

1935
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:31,520
Red light, green light

1936
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,222
(They move up a lot.)

1937
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,657
Green light

1938
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:36,225
So Min is in bare feet.

1939
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,660
(So Min is very motivated. She's barefoot again.)

1940
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,429
(Kwang Soo is slow.)

1941
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,463
Kwang Soo is out.

1942
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,665
- You got caught. You're out. - Come.

1943
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:43,766
You're out, Jae Seok.

1944
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,434
- Kwang Soo is out. - Come.

1945
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,303
Don't be so greedy, Kwang Soo.

1946
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,837
Hurry up, Kwang Soo. We have the next instruction.

1947
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:50,172
They're in push-up positions.

1948
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:53,275
(Kwang Soo is out.)

1949
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,543
Next instruction.

1950
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:57,012
Touch your nose with your tongue. Red light, green light

1951
01:11:57,012 --> 01:12:00,015
Hey, how can you do that?

1952
01:12:01,016 --> 01:12:03,352
(How can you do that?)

1953
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,621
Jae Seok is out. So Min did it.

1954
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:08,958
(Why can't you do this?)

1955
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,092
Jae Seok is out.

1956
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:11,660
My gosh.

1957
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:13,462
This is impossible.

1958
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,598
- Jae Seok is out. - Jae Seok is out.

1959
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:17,833
Look at this guy.

1960
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,436
My tongue doesn't touch my nose. I can't do it.

1961
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,770
They told me to do it.

1962
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:22,871
Gosh...

1963
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:23,939
Ready.

1964
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,474
(He's done hiding the tofu.)

1965
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:26,909
Set, go.

1966
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,111
(He's done hiding the tofu on the 2nd floor.)

1967
01:12:29,111 --> 01:12:30,713
(Whoever finds it gets to have it.)

1968
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,182
It's on the second floor.

1969
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,817
Go wild. It's on the second floor.

1970
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,552
I have to find this.

1971
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,020
- I have to find this. - Me too.

1972
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,722
(If you find the tofu, your sentence gets halved.)

1973
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,190
(While they look for the tofu, the game continues outside.)

1974
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,558
Where did he hide it?

1975
01:12:42,558 --> 01:12:43,959
(While they look for the tofu, the game continues outside.)

1976
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,294
Where is it?

1977
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:48,731
Make a cute face. Red light, green light

1978
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:52,301
(They act cute.)

1979
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,136
Make a heart...

1980
01:12:54,136 --> 01:12:56,138
(Ji Hyo touches his back.)

1981
01:12:56,138 --> 01:12:57,239
Red light, green light

1982
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,343
(They have to run to the start line.)

1983
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,511
Oh, dear.

1984
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,513
(Falling)

1985
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:08,651
(So Min shows slapstick humor.)

1986
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,553
(Ji Hyo sprints back.)

1987
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,888
Ji Hyo wins.

1988
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,257
You can go look for the tofu.

1989
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,726
I have no luck today.

1990
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:18,827
So Min, you have no time.

1991
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:20,396
Go up, and find the tofu.

1992
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,197
Go on the second floor.

1993
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,933
(Did they find it already?)

1994
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:26,602
My socks are wet.

1995
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:27,936
My shoes are wet too.

1996
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:30,305
Why are you only looking in the cells?

1997
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,410
(Seok Jin takes out something.)

1998
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,712
(He found the tofu.)

1999
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,347
(A few minutes earlier)

2000
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:43,852
(He found the tofu by the 2nd floor railing.)

2001
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:46,388
- Goodness. - Where did it go?

2002
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,624
(He hid it inside his clothes.)

2003
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,993
(Giggling)

2004
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,761
I have it.

2005
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,363
You found it?

2006
01:13:54,530 --> 01:13:55,831
You found it?

2007
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,633
Where did you find it?

2008
01:13:57,633 --> 01:14:00,936
(Where was it?)

2009
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,672
- Where did you find it? - You just put it there.

2010
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,607
I did.

2011
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,110
- You found out. - Your sentence...

2012
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,978
is halved.

2013
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:11,613
Okay.

2014
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,449
Ji Hyo wins this game.

2015
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,650
- Wow. - Good job.

2016
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,952
You can switch your sentence with another person.

2017
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,554
Before that...

2018
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,657
- It's the cell leader. - Who?

2019
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:22,925
Jae Seok is released.

2020
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,893
(Jae Seok is released this time.)

2021
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,229
- Jae Seok. - I knew it would be him.

2022
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:30,299
(He picked 4 hours,)

2023
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,235
(the 3rd shortest sentence.)

2024
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:38,273
There's another person who is soon-to-be released.

2025
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:39,975
- There's another person? - Yes.

2026
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,311
(I want to switch with that person.)

2027
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,480
Let's go. Friends.

2028
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,714
Change your clothes.

2029
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:46,949
(I'm going back into society.)

2030
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,650
Friends, I...

2031
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:51,186
It's Jong Kook. Run.

2032
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,988
(Have some tofu.)

2033
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,189
Jong Kook!

2034
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,024
It's Jong Kook. He has tofu.

2035
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:57,993
- Jong Kook! - Jong Kook!

2036
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,762
- Jong Kook. - Please.

2037
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,663
I beg you. Please.

2038
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:03,432
Jong Kook.

2039
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,267
- Jong Kook. - Please.

2040
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,469
- My sentence is so long. - Let's go.

2041
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,037
- Jong Kook. - I have 10 to 11 hours.

2042
01:15:09,037 --> 01:15:10,472
- Jong Kook. - What did you do?

2043
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:12,207
The tofu is here.

2044
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,643
- Where's my tofu? Who did this? - He has tofu.

2045
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,345
Somebody took it.

2046
01:15:16,645 --> 01:15:19,414
- Go to Jong Kook. - Somebody took my tofu.

2047
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:26,321
(She checked her tofu a few minutes earlier.)

2048
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:30,526
(Why is there a white towel instead of tofu?)

2049
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,462
(So Min's missing tofu case)

2050
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,231
(I know. It was you, right?)

2051
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,934
- I don't even know where it is. - Jae Seok.

2052
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:41,203
It's you, right? It's Jae Seok.

2053
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,337
(Suspect 1 is Jae Seok who just got released.)

2054
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,339
It's not me.

2055
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,942
Think about those who didn't leave to look for the tofu.

2056
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,277
- Give it back. - It's not me.

2057
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,578
(Suspect 2 is Kwang Soo who was left here alone.)

2058
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:51,146
- Give it back. - Find it for her.

2059
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,882
It's not me. This is not fair.

2060
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,651
Who took my tofu?

2061
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:58,120
I was playing the game, and they put a towel in here.

2062
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,290
- How many years do you have? - Kwang Soo.

2063
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,524
Is it the same as before?

2064
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,059
It is. Only an hour has passed.

2065
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,060
Here.

2066
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:10,933
(Take this tofu, So Min.)

2067
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:15,204
(Jong Kook, you're giving this to me?)

2068
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:18,507
- He's being nice. - I switched...

2069
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,975
with her.

2070
01:16:19,975 --> 01:16:22,311
- Jong Kook. - He switched with you.

2071
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:24,213
You're acting so warm.

2072
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,315
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - It's nothing.

2073
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,518
I worked so hard to make that tofu.

2074
01:16:29,518 --> 01:16:31,053
I know. Good job.

2075
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,288
But that tall jerk...

2076
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,290
(That tall jerk took it.)

2077
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,925
It's not me, punk.

2078
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:39,094
Hey, don't fight.

2079
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,896
- What's going on? - What was that?

2080
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:42,664
I hope they kiss.

2081
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:44,333
My tofu, gosh.

2082
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,968
It's not me.

2083
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,469
Who is it?

2084
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:49,872
You'll get punished. I hope three generations of your family fail.

2085
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:51,440
- Goodness. - What?

2086
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,642
(That wasn't nice.)

2087
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:54,843
Don't say that.

2088
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,511
You went too far.

2089
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,146
(Kwang Soo overreacts to what she did.)

2090
01:16:58,513 --> 01:17:02,150
(When So Min left to find Se Chan's tofu...)

2091
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,553
(He moves slowly.)

2092
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:07,789
(He takes the tofu.)

2093
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,991
Lee Kwang Soo.

2094
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:12,094
I'm done. It's complete.

2095
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,762
It's been over 30 minutes.

2096
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,764
I can't believe he's doing this.

2097
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,132
Kwang Soo,

2098
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,301
you submitted a tofu,

2099
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,603
- so your sentence is halved. - Yes!

2100
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:26,475
(He switched the tofu with a towel.)

2101
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,410
(We'll see about this.)

2102
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,012
- It's not me. - All right.

2103
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:31,813
At this time,

2104
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,350
Ji Hyo has a chance to switch with another person.

2105
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:37,119
The person who is going to be released soon...

2106
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,521
- has 15 minutes left. - It's almost time.

2107
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:41,523
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's not me.

2108
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:42,791
- Don't pick me. - It's him.

2109
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:44,559
The person with the longest sentence...

2110
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:47,229
has seven hours.

2111
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,931
- Oh, dear. Are you all right? - Who is it?

2112
01:17:48,931 --> 01:17:50,198
It's So Min.

2113
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:52,768
- Is that after being halved? - It is her.

2114
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:53,869
- No. - It's not.

2115
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:56,605
If she gets halved, she only has around five hours.

2116
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:57,940
It's not her.

2117
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,475
There's another person with seven hours. It's the longest.

2118
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:03,679
- Seven hours? - We don't have any more games left.

2119
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,547
You have to make a good decision, Ji Hyo.

2120
01:18:05,547 --> 01:18:06,748
You have to make a good decision.

2121
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:08,216
If you pick seven hours, that's the end.

2122
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,619
Hold on, Ji Hyo.

2123
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,821
- Can you let me investigate? - Sure.

2124
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:15,057
- Everybody. - Who are you?

2125
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:17,392
- I am... - You got released. You're done.

2126
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:19,594
- Get lost. - Go away.

2127
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:22,564
Get away from my house. You're irrelevant.

2128
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,132
Can I borrow your coat?

2129
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,804
(Jae Seok tries again with a detective look.)

2130
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,505
- These people... - Go away, you beggar.

2131
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,341
You came as a beggar.

2132
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:34,943
(Yelling)

2133
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:37,145
You look like a beggar.

2134
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:38,947
- I think so too. - It's true.

2135
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,949
- Did it? - It kind of did.

2136
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,551
- A little bit. - Just a bit.

2137
01:18:42,684 --> 01:18:44,553
Ji Hyo, you have to decide.

2138
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,621
What's the shortest sentence left?

2139
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:47,990
15 minutes. It's 10 minutes now.

2140
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:50,659
It's not So Min. She's not a suspect.

2141
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:54,062
The most important thing is that somebody took her tofu.

2142
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:55,497
I think it's Kwang Soo.

2143
01:18:55,497 --> 01:18:56,565
- He ate it. - I'm 100-percent sure.

2144
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:57,899
Consider the circumstance.

2145
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,434
- He was smacking his lips. - I didn't eat anything.

2146
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,136
Look at my mouth. Check it.

2147
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,538
- Check my mouth. - Hold on. There's a piece stuck.

2148
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:06,241
(She opens his mouth wide.)

2149
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:10,379
(Let me see where my tofu is.)

2150
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:12,514
- Hold on. - I didn't eat it.

2151
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,249
- There's a piece of tofu. - That's from earlier.

2152
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:16,418
- I didn't eat it. - It's definitely him.

2153
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:17,886
You still have the tofu from earlier?

2154
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,421
Think about it, Ji Hyo.

2155
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,289
You don't need to hesitate.

2156
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,592
Let me tell the truth.

2157
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:25,594
I have seven hours left. Pick me if you want.

2158
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,895
(Is he confessing?)

2159
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:31,800
(Is this Kwang Soo's timer?)

2160
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:34,503
Pick me if you want. I have nothing to lose.

2161
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,670
- Pick him. - Hey.

2162
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,805
- I have seven hours left. - Think about it.

2163
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:39,975
- She just smiled. - Ji Hyo.

2164
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,810
(Hold on. What does that smile mean?)

2165
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:45,447
(This morning when they were selecting their sentences)

2166
01:19:45,747 --> 01:19:49,818
(The person who picked 10 hours, the 2nd longest sentence...)

2167
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:53,722
(was Ji Hyo.)

2168
01:19:54,356 --> 01:19:57,059
(She has 7 hours left. She laughs at Kwang Soo's lie.)

2169
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,460
- I have seven hours left. - Ji Hyo.

2170
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,262
This is the decisive hint.

2171
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,463
Pick him. I'm sure.

2172
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:02,898
You don't have seven hours, right?

2173
01:20:02,898 --> 01:20:04,633
- I have seven hours left. - No.

2174
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,801
- Hold on. - I'm sure.

2175
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,169
- What is your decision, Ji Hyo? - Hold on.

2176
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,437
- Wait. - Do it.

2177
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,172
- Is it you? - Don't feel pressured.

2178
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,140
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

2179
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,409
(She switches with Kwang Soo.)

2180
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:16,845
As long as I'm not in last place. It's okay.

2181
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,647
You're not in last place.

2182
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:21,817
Ji Hyo, we'll show you the time left.

2183
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:23,351
Kwang Soo, we'll give you yours too.

2184
01:20:23,351 --> 01:20:25,821
- In three, you'll show everybody. - How much did you have left?

2185
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:29,391
- We'll show everybody? - In 1, 2, 3.

2186
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:34,896
(1 hour and 3 minutes)

2187
01:20:34,896 --> 01:20:37,032
Kwang Soo said he had seven hours.

2188
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,834
1 hour.

2189
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,203
(He does have 7 hours and 10 minutes now.)

2190
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,271
- 1 hour. - Kwang Soo.

2191
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,308
You had seven hours?

2192
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,043
(Thanks, Kwang Soo.)

2193
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:50,512
That's why you smiled.

2194
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:53,348
(Kwang Soo comes in last place for stealing and lying.)

2195
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,451
I knew it. You thief.

2196
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,053
- You had seven hours. - You ate it, right?

2197
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,388
- It was you, right? - I didn't eat it. I submitted it.

2198
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,624
- Hey. - It was finished. I submitted it.

2199
01:21:02,724 --> 01:21:04,659
- See? I told you. - I know.

2200
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:07,162
You have seven hours?

2201
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:08,930
I have seven hours.

2202
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:11,967
What a thief.

2203
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:13,301
Still, I was close.

2204
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,437
Three generations of your family will fail.

2205
01:21:15,437 --> 01:21:16,605
Shut your mouth.

2206
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,807
I'll marry you then.

2207
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:21,009
(Our family can fail then!)

2208
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,011
- What? - What was that?

2209
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,013
- Was that a proposal? - Was it?

2210
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,716
I just got nauseous.

2211
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:29,017
(I'm against this marriage.)

2212
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,418
(It's not that bad.)

2213
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,220
I'm just saying.

2214
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,591
(Jail time is over after the unexpected proposal.)

2215
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:39,161
The rest of you can be released.

2216
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:40,896
- Can we go? - Are they all leaving?

2217
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,198
Kwang Soo,

2218
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:45,267
make tofu for seven hours.

2219
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:46,768
By himself?

2220
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,004
You'll be left alone with your cameraman...

2221
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:51,640
and do self-bathing. You'll be released then.

2222
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,009
I did most of the work.

2223
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:56,444
So Min used all of it, so I submitted it.

2224
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:59,014
- You submitted it? - Yes.

2225
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:02,551
Then Kwang Soo, have a great rest of the time.

2226
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:04,753
- We'll visit. - We will.

2227
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,188
Take care.

2228
01:22:06,188 --> 01:22:09,024
- Go back, Kwang Soo. - Can they buy me tofu?

2229
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,192
They can.

2230
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,127
- I have plans today. - What plans?

2231
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,629
(I can't come.)

2232
01:22:14,629 --> 01:22:16,398
Where do you have to be?

2233
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:18,233
- I'm sorry. - With whom?

2234
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,802
- And I have no money. - What do you mean?

2235
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:24,472
I'll transfer you the money. Get me some tofu.

2236
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,974
I didn't bring my wallet.

2237
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:29,811
If you buy me tofu, I won't forget your kindness.

2238
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:31,279
I won't forget it.

2239
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:32,714
- I don't trust you. - Do you think anybody will?

2240
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,683
It doesn't benefit us in any way.

2241
01:22:34,683 --> 01:22:37,385
- Let's leave. - Shall we go?

2242
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:39,421
Kwang Soo, please return to the same cell.

2243
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:41,089
- I don't want to go. - Take care.

2244
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:44,359
Please help me. I'm sorry. I won't steal again.

2245
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,595
- Give me one chance. - Make a tofu.

2246
01:22:46,595 --> 01:22:48,330
- Give me another chance. - Hope that they buy you tofu.

2247
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,565
Please buy me 1. Just 1.

2248
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,334
They are all leaving!

2249
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:58,607
(The thief, Kwang Soo, gets imprisoned again.)

2250
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:00,508
How am I supposed to make this?

2251
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,910
(His only friend for 7 hours is the millstone.)

2252
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,713
How do I make this? Do I have to self-bathe too?

2253
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:09,184
(The self-bathing system is ready.)

2254
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,386
My goodness. When will I finish?

2255
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:13,188
I'm sorry.

2256
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,857
What's wrong with you?

2257
01:23:15,857 --> 01:23:18,693
What did I do? What did I...

2258
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:22,797
- Why do you keep committing crimes? - No, that's not why.

2259
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:24,132
(His cameraman is mad at him.)

2260
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:26,134
I shouldn't have said I had seven hours left.

2261
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:28,737
This is driving me nuts.

2262
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,040
(Spinning)

2263
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,241
When will I grind all this?

2264
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:36,811
(He keeps on spinning it, but the soybeans don't go away.)

2265
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,515
(What did I do so wrong?)

2266
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,753
To make this...

2267
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:46,021
Jae Seok!

2268
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:48,923
(He comes back.)

2269
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,861
(Kwang Soo, I got you tofu.)

2270
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:55,930
- Kwang Soo. - Jae Seok.

2271
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,332
You punk.

2272
01:23:57,332 --> 01:23:58,933
- Jae Seok. - You are still here.

2273
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:01,136
I'm sorry.

2274
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:02,704
I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

2275
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,372
- I felt this for the first time. - Kwang Soo.

2276
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,041
I felt like this for the first time.

2277
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:07,676
You punk.

2278
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,513
- You can't commit crimes. - I'm sorry.

2279
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:14,783
- Your parents are watching you! - I'm sorry.

2280
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,085
- Kwang Soo. - Yes.

2281
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,386
I knew you'd come.

2282
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:20,588
- I never doubted it. - You punk...

2283
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:23,792
(They're absorbed in their act.)

2284
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:25,660
- Thank you, Jae Seok. - Here.

2285
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,362
- You're fine. - Thank you.

2286
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:29,831
- It's all good. - Give it to me.

2287
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,000
This is enough.

2288
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,436
Thank you. I committed a big crime.

2289
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:35,704
Give me a spoon.

2290
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:38,306
I repented for everything.

2291
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,342
(You don't have to feed me.)

2292
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:42,410
- My gosh. - I'm sorry.

2293
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,845
Thanks.

2294
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,547
Sorry?

2295
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,082
I'm going to eat this on my way home.

2296
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,551
(Thanks for the spoon.)

2297
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,721
(Give me the tofu.)

2298
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,290
What are you saying?

2299
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:57,559
What are you doing?

2300
01:24:57,726 --> 01:25:01,162
- Really? - Jong Kook got this earlier.

2301
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,932
- I wanted to eat it on my way. - Why would you do that?

2302
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:07,302
Buy one on your way home! Give this to me!

2303
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:09,104
- Jae Seok. - If you give it to him,

2304
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,472
he has 3 hours and 10 minutes left.

2305
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:13,541
(His sentence will be shortened to 3 hours and 10 minutes.)

2306
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,676
This is...

2307
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,412
enough.

2308
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,447
- Are you giving it to him? - Yes.

2309
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,216
Thank you. Thank you, Jae Seok.

2310
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:24,552
Kwang Soo, you have 3 hours and 10 minutes left.

2311
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,020
Thank you.

2312
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,122
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2313
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,556
- Be good. - Okay.

2314
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,758
- Don't betray people. - Okay.

2315
01:25:29,758 --> 01:25:31,025
- I won't steal. - Don't, okay?

2316
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,227
- Don't steal people's stuff. - Okay.

2317
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,328
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

2318
01:25:33,328 --> 01:25:35,530
- I'll be good. - It's cold.

2319
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,432
I'll finish my sentence and get back.

2320
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,168
That's right. Finish the three hours.

2321
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,336
- All right? - Yes.

2322
01:25:41,436 --> 01:25:42,871
- Thank you! - No worries.

2323
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:45,540
- I'll repay my debt of gratitude. - Okay.

2324
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,109
- All right, Kwang Soo. - Please take care!

2325
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:49,644
- Okay. - Thank you.

2326
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:51,646
You don't know how to make it, right?

2327
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,947
Isn't this how you do it?

2328
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:55,283
I'm done. I have to boil this.

2329
01:25:55,683 --> 01:25:56,885
Haha!

2330
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,790
(He once again pretends like he's born again.)

2331
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:04,159
You're not like that, right?

2332
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:05,660
I was a fool.

2333
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,962
I wanted to get out.

2334
01:26:07,962 --> 01:26:09,330
(I have changed.)

2335
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:10,398
I'm sorry.

2336
01:26:10,398 --> 01:26:15,637
- I'll take care of your parents. - What?

2337
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,773
My dad and my mom? Why?

2338
01:26:19,474 --> 01:26:21,443
Don't worry. I'm a loyal person.

2339
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,846
Are you empty... Are you empty-handed?

2340
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,315
Haha. Hold on.

2341
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:31,753
(I'll see you back in society.)

2342
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,021
Haha!

2343
01:26:35,156 --> 01:26:36,491
What did you do?

2344
01:26:37,459 --> 01:26:38,760
Be good.

2345
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,962
(Thanks to Haha, his sentence is reduced to 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

2346
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:42,263
Be good.

2347
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,203
Seok Jin! My gosh.

2348
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,105
My mom keeps on asking why I'm not coming home.

2349
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,776
- Feeling! - Intuition!

2350
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:56,044
- Cross! - Cross!

2351
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,546
- Good job. - Ji Hyo!

2352
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,381
- Thank you. - Do your best.

2353
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,116
Thank you. Okay.

2354
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,351
So this...

2355
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:04,452
(He's almost done. He focuses on making tofu.)

2356
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:05,687
The stove...

2357
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:09,924
Does this become that?

2358
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:13,094
This becomes that when I boil it?

2359
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:16,598
(That doesn't look like tofu.)

2360
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,932
This is tofu?

2361
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:20,702
Kwang Soo.

2362
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:24,606
(Kwang Soo)

2363
01:27:24,706 --> 01:27:28,910
(Her warmth makes him regret about his mistakes and betrayal.)

2364
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,411
Kwang Soo.

2365
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:32,947
How could you lie to me so shamelessly?

2366
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,849
- I'm sorry. - I'm not that gullible,

2367
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:36,618
- I regret it. - but you tricked me.

2368
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,619
(I reflected on myself.)

2369
01:27:37,619 --> 01:27:39,354
Please give me another chance. I'm sorry.

2370
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:42,891
Cry.

2371
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,093
Cry. Let me see you cry.

2372
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:47,228
If I see a drop of tear, I'll give it to you.

2373
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,530
Goodness.

2374
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,665
(She provokes him.)

2375
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,700
Kwang Soo, you are released.

2376
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:55,436
(His sentence has expired.)

2377
01:27:57,372 --> 01:27:58,540
(Come back, you punk.)

2378
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,241
Hey, come back.

2379
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,643
- What did you say? - Kwang Soo.

2380
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,211
Take your tofu, and get lost.

2381
01:28:03,211 --> 01:28:05,179
Take it, and get lost. I don't need it.

2382
01:28:05,179 --> 01:28:06,581
- Don't throw it at me. - It's for you.

2383
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:07,949
I got released.

2384
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:10,585
- I brought it for you. - I don't want it.

2385
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:13,054
This is for making stew. I can't eat it.

2386
01:28:13,254 --> 01:28:16,524
Everybody gave me regular ones. Only you got me this.

2387
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:17,592
(If he didn't get out, she would have made him eat it.)

2388
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:18,660
(Congratulations on your release.)

2389
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:21,362
Kwang Soo, take a self-bath,

2390
01:28:21,529 --> 01:28:23,097
and go home.

2391
01:28:23,164 --> 01:28:26,000
For the rest of my life, I'll serve others...

2392
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,504
and live cleanly. Thank you.

2393
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,307
There's a button. You can press it.

2394
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,741
I'm talking right now.

2395
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:35,343
I'm talking.

2396
01:28:35,343 --> 01:28:36,678
I'm sorry.

2397
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,813
It's difficult to come here the 1st time, but not the 2nd time.

2398
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,848
- I'm sorry. - Okay?

2399
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:48,590
(A water bomb for one person stands in a lonesome way.)

2400
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:53,761
(One man exits the prison to receive the penalty.)

2401
01:28:54,996 --> 01:29:00,168
(Goodbye, prison. A bath is bound to change me.)

2402
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,437
It's a do-it-yourself penalty.

2403
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,172
You need to speak louder because there is no microphone.

2404
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,007
There is no microphone.

2405
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,141
(There are only 1 producer and 1 cameraman on the set.)

2406
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:08,710
It's a do-it-yourself penalty.

2407
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,844
(There are only 1 producer and 1 cameraman on the set.)

2408
01:29:12,146 --> 01:29:13,848
Don't you think this is too cruel?

2409
01:29:14,782 --> 01:29:17,685
- I need to press it myself? - Yes, the button is next to you.

2410
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:22,624
(The water comes out when he presses the button.)

2411
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,592
I am sorry, viewers.

2412
01:29:25,793 --> 01:29:30,198
I will pay penance and start a new life.

2413
01:29:30,999 --> 01:29:35,436
If you lie or steal,

2414
01:29:35,903 --> 01:29:37,171
you will receive a penalty.

2415
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:39,340
I am sorry.

2416
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,109
(I am sorry, viewers.)

2417
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:45,013
(Shall we begin?)

2418
01:29:49,317 --> 01:29:52,487
(He does his own work.)

2419
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:53,788
I am sorry!

2420
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:54,856
(He feels like his sins are washed away.)

2421
01:29:54,856 --> 01:29:56,557
I won't do it again.

2422
01:29:57,792 --> 01:29:59,460
(Screaming)

2423
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:00,762
No one is here.

2424
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:03,765
Where do I need to go?

2425
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,300
Kwang Soo.

2426
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:08,302
Please clap for the slate.

2427
01:30:08,736 --> 01:30:12,173
(Don't make fun of me!)

2428
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:19,781
(Waddling)

2429
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:21,482
I will clap.

2430
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:23,518
In 1, 2, 3.

2431
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:28,256
(Running Man in Jeju)

2432
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,191
(The first story)

2433
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,326
(The queen of variety shows, Gu Ha Ra)

2434
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:33,961
(The woman with many charms, Seor In A)

2435
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,897
(The girl with fruit-like charms, Mi Na of Gugudan)

2436
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:37,832
(The master of variety shows, Lee Da Hee)

2437
01:30:38,433 --> 01:30:39,867
(In Jeju Island,)

2438
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:41,869
(they dream of romance.)

2439
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:43,504
(Like you are shot)

2440
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,273
(The crazy one...)

2441
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:47,041
(next to the crazy one)

2442
01:30:47,041 --> 01:30:48,910
(All of them are crazy.)

2443
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,211
She is Lee Jung Hyun!

2444
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:52,380
(Even So Min is shocked...)

2445
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:54,849
(by the craziness.)

2446
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,384
Why is she going that far?

2447
01:30:57,485 --> 01:30:59,253
Let's insert it at the count of three.

2448
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:00,755
In 1, 2, 3.

2449
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:03,991
You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?

2450
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:05,159
(You are an utter jerk, aren't you?)

2451
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:08,096
(Craziness at Jeju Special)
