1
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,685
(Recap)

2
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:13,625
(Lee Da Hee, a tall rookie of the variety shows)

3
00:00:14,251 --> 00:00:16,425
(Koo Ha Ra, the athletic idol singer)

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,420
(Seor In A, super rookie of 2018)

5
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,655
That's Seor In A.

6
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,565
(Mina of Gugudan, the bubbly one)

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,830
(These 4 beautiful ladies flew to Jeju Island to join the race.)

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,790
(Or could they be the best TV personalities for variety shows?)

9
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:30,960
(Are they idol singers?)

10
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:33,770
(No, they are the crazy ladies.)

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,815
(These queens of variety shows came to take over Running Man.)

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,370
(A partner race, Rule of Collection)

13
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,215
(Each partner chooses a number from 1 to 6.)

14
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:47,725
(The pairs with the highest and lowest sums of numbers win.)

15
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:53,195
(The remaining pairs will face the water bomb.)

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,760
(The water bomb is at stake on the last mission, Pirate Roulette Quiz.)

17
00:00:57,761 --> 00:01:00,660
(The reckless members choose Betting Pirate with the hope of winning.)

18
00:01:00,664 --> 00:01:03,735
(The unfortunate members make it hard for the pirate to rest.)

19
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:07,630
(Let's insert it on the count of three for our partnership's sake.)

20
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,775
You're the worst. You're such a jerk.

21
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:14,545
(Kwang Soo has become a jerk. What will happen to him now?)

22
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:18,340
- Please pop. Please. - "You're such a jerk."

23
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:19,615
(The last question will determine the winning pair.)

24
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:21,885
Do you want to do it together this time?

25
00:01:21,918 --> 00:01:22,985
- Okay. - Are you sure?

26
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:24,355
I'm sure it will pop.

27
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:26,580
You have to insert it this time.

28
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:28,650
If you do it at the same time, we won't know which one caused it.

29
00:01:28,658 --> 00:01:30,335
I know. That's the point. All right.

30
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,160
- If we get this one, we will win. - We can win then.

31
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,590
All right. Stick it in on the count of three.

32
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,535
- All right. 1, 2, 3. - She's counting.

33
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:42,170
- I can't believe you! - No, no.

34
00:01:42,172 --> 00:01:44,415
(Kwang Soo's hand still doesn't move.)

35
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:48,045
I missed my cue. I missed my cue.

36
00:01:48,178 --> 00:01:49,670
- Hey, "1, 2, 3." - I just missed my window.

37
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,240
- How could you miss this? - I'm sorry.

38
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:53,215
I'm sorry. I really am. You counted out of nowhere.

39
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:55,110
You didn't give me a heads-up.

40
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:57,680
Had you counted before to let me know, I would've done it.

41
00:01:57,687 --> 00:01:59,395
Jong Kook, she's so cute.

42
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:00,950
- My gosh, she's the cutest. - One more time.

43
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:03,250
- 1, 2, 3. Then you insert it. - No, I mean...

44
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,660
You could've said, "1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3."

45
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:07,590
- You went, "1, 2, 3." - You really are a jerk.

46
00:02:07,597 --> 00:02:08,790
- It just caught me off guard. - You are such a jerk.

47
00:02:08,798 --> 00:02:10,760
I can't believe you. Anyway, just insert it then. I'll watch.

48
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,175
Mine didn't pop.

49
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,600
(Pressured)

50
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:14,705
- This is driving me crazy. - I bet it will pop.

51
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,505
(She's watching him intently.)

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,115
I bet it's going to pop.

53
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,540
I'm sure of it.

54
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,540
(He's serious.)

55
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:22,610
Kwang Soo, if yours pop this time,

56
00:02:22,612 --> 00:02:24,180
I think I'm going to be really angry.

57
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,915
You won't be friends with Da Hee anymore.

58
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:28,550
Da Hee knows the answer.

59
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:29,550
(Kwang Soo has nowhere to turn.)

60
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:30,550
This is crazy.

61
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:31,695
(What will happen to Kwang Soo?)

62
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:33,620
Okay!

63
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,650
(He succeeds.)

64
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,425
- We did it. - You have three left.

65
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,560
You have the opposite feelings.

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,895
(Will I escape the curse of bad luck starting today?)

67
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,990
- Let's take a seat. - You're not challenging it, right?

68
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,260
All right. Then you will have the chance to answer the question first.

69
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:46,535
- Okay. - Good luck.

70
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,270
The answer is number one, boiled pork.

71
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,700
(Confident Da Hee chooses number 1, boiled pork.)

72
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,800
- Boiled pork. - It's because...

73
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,570
Da Hee knows how trotters...

74
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:57,215
- originated. - They didn't exist back then.

75
00:02:57,347 --> 00:03:00,080
And I was slightly confused with chicken soup.

76
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,110
Since it's soup, I thought it'd be boiled down.

77
00:03:02,118 --> 00:03:06,495
- So to get it delivered... - Why do you two stand like that?

78
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:10,235
Wait, no. It's not what you think.

79
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,420
- Are you models, posing for shots? - No.

80
00:03:12,429 --> 00:03:14,390
- It's not what you think. - You always stand behind her.

81
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:16,875
- Why do you do that? - I want her to be on camera.

82
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,270
Both of them are cunning.

83
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,370
Insert it for number one, boiled pork.

84
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,975
- Okay. - Number one, boiled pork.

85
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:25,700
Okay!

86
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,010
(They make a bet on an answer.)

87
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,245
Number one, boiled pork.

88
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:30,540
(Is number 1, boiled pork the right answer?)

89
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:32,140
(It's wrong.)

90
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,050
I can't believe this. No way.

91
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,610
- I told you so. - Hey, I told you...

92
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,555
- boiled pork wasn't it. - My gosh, seriously.

93
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,655
- Kwang Soo should've answered it. - This was...

94
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:45,495
(This isn't what we were expecting.)

95
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,230
Ha Ra will get it right.

96
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,330
(Ha Ra and Jae Seok will try.)

97
00:03:49,332 --> 00:03:50,605
Number five, hangover soup.

98
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,770
Everyone, you think it's not the answer because it's soup.

99
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,770
You're wrong.

100
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:56,270
The soup would've spilled.

101
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,500
(5, hangover soup)

102
00:03:57,507 --> 00:03:59,800
- I'll insert 5. Jae Seok. - 5.

103
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,270
- You should choose. - No, no.

104
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:02,545
You should insert three.

105
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:05,915
(Popping)

106
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,710
See?

107
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:09,985
Let's change. Hurry!

108
00:04:10,587 --> 00:04:12,480
- We should go. Six? - This is crazy.

109
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,050
- Five. - What am I going to do?

110
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:15,325
- Let's do 3. - 3?

111
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:16,965
I'm not sure if we'll have a chance.

112
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,735
How could it pop at our first try?

113
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,090
(So Min places her bet in the midst of the commotion.)

114
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,165
- I thought it was correct. - I can't believe this.

115
00:04:22,198 --> 00:04:24,360
(And she fails.)

116
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:27,070
(It's the disappointing end of a reckless player.)

117
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,405
She tried.

118
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,340
- I'm going all in with six. - Did she just try that?

119
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,015
I'm going all in with six.

120
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,345
We need one for the Answer Pirate.

121
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:35,985
Three.

122
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:37,615
Chicken soup.

123
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,910
No. Should I try one?

124
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:41,985
Yes, try it.

125
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,410
- Besides, - Go for it.

126
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,880
- there's only three options. - Go for it.

127
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:45,955
(They pick number 3, chicken soup.)

128
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,995
(This lady who staked everything she had...)

129
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:55,865
(is the super rookie among the unlucky ones.)

130
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:56,900
It has to pop.

131
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,030
(She couldn't say anything as she failed 3 times in a row.)

132
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,900
I guess her name didn't mean what I thought it meant.

133
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:08,885
(Will she be able to redeem herself this time?)

134
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,280
- I mean, seriously. - Hey!

135
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:14,750
(As expected, she is still the unlucky one.)

136
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,810
- Come here! - I mean, seriously.

137
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:19,780
Hey! Darn you. Come here!

138
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,965
What's wrong with you? What are you?

139
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:25,095
We should perform an exorcism. Prepare for an exorcism.

140
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,005
We have to do an exorcism on her. She's giving me the chills.

141
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,805
- Yes, do it. - We have to perform one.

142
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,935
- Who are you? - In A.

143
00:05:32,702 --> 00:05:34,530
- You're not In A, are you? - This is unbelievable.

144
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:35,705
You're not her, right?

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,275
We have 10, right?

146
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,115
But what's the answer?

147
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,245
What if we have the wrong answer?

148
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,855
It doesn't matter. We must go for it.

149
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,540
Look at those love birds.

150
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:46,915
(What's Korea's first delivery food?)

151
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,425
1, 2, 3.

152
00:05:50,053 --> 00:05:51,455
- If they succeed with nine... - My goodness.

153
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,550
(What happened?)

154
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:56,550
We won!

155
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,635
- What just happened? - Yes!

156
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:01,705
(Se Chan and Mina, who did nothing, win the game.)

157
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,145
The victory goes to Se Chan's team.

158
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,170
- Yes! - It's their win. The answer is...

159
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,015
- What's the answer? - It's number five, hangover soup.

160
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,700
- We were going to go for that. - Hey.

161
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,770
We should've thought it as rice soup.

162
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:17,915
(People cooked the soup during the night, and it arrived at dawn.)

163
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,550
- They won't change. - No, they probably won't.

164
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,910
- It's over then. - Hey, this was...

165
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,210
- All right. - The stage.

166
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,995
Let me reveal the final sums.

167
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:28,565
- The highest sum, 10 points, - Good for you, Kwang Soo.

168
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,935
Goes to Kwang Soo and Da Hee.

169
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,265
- And... - "And"?

170
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,705
Jae Seok and Ha Ra have 10 points too.

171
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:40,870
- Come on. - Except for these three pairs,

172
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,830
the rest will face the water bomb.

173
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,840
(They'll face the penalty.)

174
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,640
- We did it! We did it! - It's over.

175
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:47,085
(They set out to get the penalty in the snowing weather.)

176
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,710
Let's go.

177
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,715
(Jong Kook, So Min, and In A are exempted from the penalty.)

178
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:55,985
The three of you will get the water bomb now.

179
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,195
One,

180
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:00,595
- two, - It'll be warm!

181
00:07:01,357 --> 00:07:02,565
- 3! - 3!

182
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,665
(Is this a warm shower?)

183
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,435
(It's fun to watch others get the water bomb.)

184
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:14,730
(His hair looks like seaweed.)

185
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:15,830
- I feel so bad. - Good job.

186
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,100
- Well done. - Great work, everyone.

187
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,485
(The race in Jeju Island begins now!)

188
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:25,740
(Part 2 of Jeju Island Special, Roads of Jeju's Famous Locations)

189
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:30,385
(Find the tastiest, coolest, and the most entertaining activities.)

190
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,325
(The chaotic race in Jeju Island begins now.)

191
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,625
This is just for you.

192
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,860
- Hello. Hi. - Hello.

193
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,105
- Hi. - Hi.

194
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,565
- Good morning. - Hello.

195
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,360
- Welcome. - Morning, everyone.

196
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:46,475
It's warm.

197
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:50,815
- Haha is all dressed up today. - Right.

198
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,200
- He got excited about this trip. - His outfit tells me...

199
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,670
- "Head, shoulder, knees, and feet". - He has a problem.

200
00:07:54,677 --> 00:07:56,210
- "Swag". - He dressed up like G-Dragon,

201
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:59,515
but he's not even close.

202
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,785
(Try to copy me if you can.)

203
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,055
Now that I see him in person, Haha is no match for him.

204
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,825
- He also talks like G-Dragon too. - Right.

205
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,595
"Okay."

206
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:14,590
- Haha, don't go overboard. - I think this is removable.

207
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:17,330
It's not that it's removable. He's afraid he might lose it,

208
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,260
- so he tied it there. - Hey, that's enough.

209
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,705
- Don't mental institutions do this? - Stop it.

210
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:23,030
- Don't they? - Cool it.

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,040
- I think they do this there. - I saw that too.

212
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,975
- Do you go to soccer classes then? - Hey.

213
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,670
It's better to get this over with now.

214
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,580
Are you here to take coaching classes or what?

215
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm not lying when I saw this, but lately, Yu Seok, the cameraman,

216
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:33,780
dresses better than you.

217
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:35,285
(The cameraman is a better dresser.)

218
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,655
Look. He's wearing the navy jacket.

219
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,780
- Wear something like that. - He has a lot of clothes. I see.

220
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,790
Look at the navy jacket. That looks nice.

221
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,725
- That's a nice color. - His clothes are colorful.

222
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:47,965
Today, it's a relaxing tour where you can enjoy the nature.

223
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,660
This race in Jeju Island is called Bingo to the Flowery Road.

224
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,235
- He said it's a relaxing tour. - This is nice.

225
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:54,730
- "Flowery Road"? - "Bingo to the Flowery Road"?

226
00:08:54,737 --> 00:08:55,805
(Flowery road? Relaxing?)

227
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,975
- This will be a 4-on-4 team match. - 4-on-4?

228
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,370
You select and carry out a mission in a square.

229
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,215
If you succeed, you win a square on the bingo board...

230
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:07,410
and get an opportunity to win a Chance Card.

231
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,550
Okay.

232
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,255
The first team to complete a line wins.

233
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,420
The winning team takes the best accommodation,

234
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,250
the luxury suite.

235
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:16,425
- The suite! - The suite!

236
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:22,465
(The winning team gets to rest in the luxury suite.)

237
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:24,960
(Let's go to the suite.)

238
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:25,960
I have never been to one.

239
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:28,670
The losing team sleeps on an ice rink.

240
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:29,905
- An ice rink? - An ice rink?

241
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,000
(Do the losers have to sleep on an ice rink?)

242
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,300
- An ice rink? - Yes.

243
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,045
- The losing team sleeps on it. - That's the worst.

244
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:40,480
(The losing team gets to be cozy in the tents on an ice rink.)

245
00:09:40,483 --> 00:09:41,810
Your face might become paralyzed.

246
00:09:41,818 --> 00:09:44,955
People who sleep on the ice rink might not wake up the next day.

247
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,290
Sleeping on an ice rink is too much.

248
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,650
Those who sleep on the ice rink will be...

249
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:52,560
3 members from the losing team and 1 member from the winning team.

250
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:53,560
- Why? - Why?

251
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:56,790
(3 members from the losing team and 1 member from the winning team)

252
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,375
Why would you choose one member from the winning team?

253
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:02,170
The winning team saves one member from the losing team,

254
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:05,515
and the losing team selects one member from the winning team.

255
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,040
There are so many twists and turns.

256
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:09,070
That means Jae Seok will sleep on the ice rink...

257
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:11,040
whether he wins or loses.

258
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,840
- You are the same. - That's not true.

259
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,110
- You are the same. - Speak for yourself.

260
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,620
We have two people who are most likely to be selected.

261
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,995
- What are you talking about? - One of them will be selected.

262
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:20,520
The only way I can save myself...

263
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,450
is by winning with Jae Seok in my team.

264
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,595
That's right. That's the only way.

265
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:27,965
I can already picture who will sleep...

266
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:29,890
on the ice rink.

267
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:31,635
Please bring in the bingo board.

268
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,205
What is that? There are a lot of options.

269
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,040
There are a lot of options.

270
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,500
(Various places in Jeju Island are included.)

271
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:43,545
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

272
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,840
(The missions of Bingo to the Flowery Road...)

273
00:10:46,849 --> 00:10:50,285
(lets them enjoy all aspects of the beautiful island.)

274
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,280
"The first tangerine tree". "Korean peninsula in Jeju Island".

275
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,425
- I know what it is. - It's beautiful.

276
00:10:57,293 --> 00:11:00,905
(The first tangerine tree of Jeju Island dates back to 1911.)

277
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,860
(The shape of the Korean peninsula is a treasure of the Olle Trail...)

278
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:08,005
(that is located in Namwon Keuneong Promenade.)

279
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:10,205
What's the oldest building in Jeju Island?

280
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:16,185
(Gwandeogjeong breathes with the history since 1448.)

281
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:23,785
(The biggest Camellia Hill in Asia)

282
00:11:24,086 --> 00:11:26,120
I should eat the meat noodles with 60 years of traditions.

283
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,590
I told you that I want to eat it on my way here.

284
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,495
- We should eat black cattle. - Black cattle.

285
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:35,230
(Black cattle is a natural monument that was given to the king.)

286
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:38,135
(The oldest meat noodles restaurant serves a delicious dish.)

287
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,630
There is "eliminating the name tag of the target".

288
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,675
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

289
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:45,875
My goodness.

290
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:49,045
(It's not fitting for a healing trip.)

291
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:50,680
(Confident)

292
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,615
Before the race, you will be divided into two teams.

293
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:56,950
In the count of three,

294
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,595
all members must either sit or stand.

295
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,190
When 4 members sit down and 4 members stand up,

296
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,795
the two teams will be divided.

297
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:06,420
The team members are important.

298
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:08,165
(The team members are important for victory.)

299
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:09,565
Let's go.

300
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:11,800
We either sit or stand.

301
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:13,000
(Odd numbers sit and even numbers stand at first.)

302
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,330
- What should I do? - Up and down! In 1, 2...

303
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:17,800
(You become a team with the members who choose the same position.)

304
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,975
My goodness.

305
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:21,245
My goodness.

306
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,470
(5 members are standing, and 3 members are sitting.)

307
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,740
The teams haven't been decided yet.

308
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,940
- Kwang Soo stood up a bit late. - No, I didn't.

309
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:29,110
- Sit or stand at three. - Okay.

310
00:12:29,118 --> 00:12:30,110
Here we go.

311
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,480
Up and down! In 1, 2...

312
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:34,765
(Are the teams decided this time?)

313
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:36,925
It's 4 versus 4.

314
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,995
Up and down! In 1, 2...

315
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,005
It's 4 versus 4.

316
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,400
We can win with these members.

317
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:47,370
(Haha, Jong Kook, Jae Seok, and So Min are standing.)

318
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,630
We can win with these members.

319
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,405
I am a bit surprised.

320
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:52,700
I am a bit surprised.

321
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,185
Victory is ours.

322
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,110
(Let's see.)

323
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:58,415
Hold on. Hold on.

324
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,240
- Give me a chance. - Let's do it once again.

325
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:02,310
It won't be fun with these teams.

326
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:03,550
- It won't be fun. - We will be destroyed.

327
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:05,220
- Let's try it one more time. - We will be destroyed.

328
00:13:05,221 --> 00:13:06,480
- This won't work. - Let's try it one more time.

329
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,665
- This won't work. - This won't work.

330
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:10,450
- Victory is ours. - Let's sleep in the suite.

331
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,120
- Let's sleep in the suite. - This is great.

332
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,295
Seriously.

333
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:15,430
- We are set. - This is great.

334
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,265
Okay. We will sleep on the ice rink.

335
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,360
- It won't be fun. - This won't work.

336
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:22,630
We are the varsity team, and they are the junior varsity team.

337
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:26,575
(We are the varsity team, and they are the junior varsity team.)

338
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,910
- What are you talking about? - For goodness' sake.

339
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:29,970
Junior varsity team, my foot!

340
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,315
Just you wait.

341
00:13:31,847 --> 00:13:34,550
- This is new. - "Just you wait"?

342
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,625
Are these the teams?

343
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,180
We have everything.

344
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,580
We have strength, intellect,

345
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:42,050
and flippant charms. We have everything.

346
00:13:42,058 --> 00:13:43,390
We are set.

347
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:45,295
We don't have anything.

348
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,505
Your team doesn't have stamina.

349
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,765
- Stamina? - They have no stamina.

350
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,060
- They have no stamina. - This is the worst.

351
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:54,730
- We are the weakest team. - What should I do?

352
00:13:54,737 --> 00:13:55,830
We are the weakest team.

353
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,640
There usually were Team Jae Seok and Team Jong Kook.

354
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,475
You will have to come up with new names today.

355
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:03,485
Team Senior and Team Junior.

356
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,415
Jae Seok debuted before Seok Jin.

357
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:06,740
That's right.

358
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:07,985
Team Junior Jee.

359
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,485
Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee.

360
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:13,495
If you don't do well today, you will get a scolding.

361
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,825
A scolding? Hey.

362
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:17,895
It's natural for a junior to get a scolding from the senior.

363
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,460
- Jae Seok is your senior. - He is a senior comedian.

364
00:14:20,463 --> 00:14:23,990
I will get you one day, you punk.

365
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,475
Hold me back.

366
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:26,800
- What? - Hold me back.

367
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,930
I know you won't do anything to begin with.

368
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:30,630
We will go with Team Senior Yu,

369
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,800
- and Team Junior Jee. - So it's Team Junior.

370
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:35,970
After Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee change,

371
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,515
- the race will begin. - Is this really happening?

372
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:40,340
Is this really happening?

373
00:14:40,349 --> 00:14:41,710
It's okay. We will win. Let's win.

374
00:14:41,717 --> 00:14:43,285
Let's show them what we can do.

375
00:14:44,086 --> 00:14:45,695
I don't belong in this team.

376
00:14:46,088 --> 00:14:47,850
I have a different color.

377
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:49,390
- Stop it. - Hey.

378
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,960
- I don't belong in this team. - You represent this team.

379
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:54,330
- You lowered the team's quality. - We are like oil and water.

380
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,690
- We don't belong together. - You represent this team.

381
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:59,235
You lowered the team's quality.

382
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,245
I don't belong in this team.

383
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:07,415
(Team Senior Yu and Team Junior Jee)

384
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,985
Jae Seok, let's go.

385
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,615
- Are we taking the car? - We have the fighting spirits.

386
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:15,910
Please take this before you go.

387
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:16,985
Okay.

388
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:23,025
(Why is there a roulette?)

389
00:15:23,492 --> 00:15:26,160
- What is this? - Before you go,

390
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:29,005
you see "eliminating the name tag of the target", right?

391
00:15:29,532 --> 00:15:31,900
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

392
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,660
For this, you eliminate the name tag...

393
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,230
of the chosen member in the opposing team.

394
00:15:35,237 --> 00:15:37,540
(Eliminate the name tag of the chosen member.)

395
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,300
You will choose the member before you go.

396
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:41,610
So that the other team doesn't see the result,

397
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,570
- spin the roulette at your spot. - Let's avoid Jong Kook.

398
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:45,215
Let's avoid Jong Kook.

399
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:47,850
It will be easy to dominate the race.

400
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,185
- Our team... - Let's spin the roulette.

401
00:15:50,219 --> 00:15:51,920
It doesn't matter which member we get.

402
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:53,180
I hope we get Seok Jin.

403
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,525
Seok Jin will be the best choice.

404
00:15:55,758 --> 00:15:57,495
- Say, "Start." - Start.

405
00:15:58,327 --> 00:15:59,695
It's only right that you spin the roulette.

406
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,105
My goodness.

407
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,865
It's only right that you spin the roulette.

408
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:04,435
My goodness.

409
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,045
- My goodness. - My goodness.

410
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:09,970
- This is fun. - It's game over.

411
00:16:09,972 --> 00:16:11,875
- This is great. - This is fun.

412
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:14,075
Let's stick together today.

413
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,445
- We have to do this. - We have to win.

414
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,240
It will be too boring if we lose.

415
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:21,310
We have to win.

416
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:24,080
We will win today.

417
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,780
I am sorry. I will be serious today.

418
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,320
I am sorry. I won't be funny today.

419
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:29,650
- I am sorry. - Don't expect us to joke around.

420
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,395
- We will win today. - Dear viewers,

421
00:16:31,527 --> 00:16:32,935
don't laugh for an hour.

422
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:34,630
Watch the show with seriousness.

423
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,830
Watch the race...

424
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:39,060
as if you are watching the Olympic Games. We are serious.

425
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,930
We will be fine as long as you do well.

426
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:42,205
This is Pyeongchang Olympics.

427
00:16:42,238 --> 00:16:43,370
We can spin the roulette now, right?

428
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:46,275
- Pick a member. - Spin the roulette.

429
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,085
- Say, "Start." - It's a practice round.

430
00:16:49,378 --> 00:16:50,745
Spin it for practice.

431
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,140
- Spin it for practice. - It's a practice round.

432
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:53,480
It's nothing.

433
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:55,485
- Okay! So Min! - So Min! We did it.

434
00:16:56,852 --> 00:16:59,080
(They give a ceremony after seeing they picked So Min.)

435
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,880
- For goodness' sake. - All right.

436
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,750
The four of you must shout, "Start."

437
00:17:02,758 --> 00:17:04,760
- We did that. - No, you didn't.

438
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,995
We did that.

439
00:17:06,562 --> 00:17:08,330
Okay, okay.

440
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,265
Okay. Spin the roulette.

441
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:11,560
In 2, 3.

442
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,445
- Why would you spin it? - It's a practice round.

443
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,530
- Why would you spin it? - It's a practice round.

444
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:17,915
It's a practice round.

445
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,100
So Min!

446
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:21,910
(They get So Min again.)

447
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,345
No.

448
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,840
(They make the ceremony look more natural.)

449
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,625
Let's go.

450
00:17:28,717 --> 00:17:29,710
Come on.

451
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,220
- Say, "Start." - Let's go.

452
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,455
- Start. - Start.

453
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,850
- Here I go. - Let's spin it together.

454
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,290
In 1, 2, 3.

455
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:39,395
(After Ji Hyo shouts, "Start," they spin the roulette for real.)

456
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:45,535
(Please let it be So Min again.)

457
00:17:51,907 --> 00:17:54,385
(They get Jong Kook.)

458
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:57,570
We have to shout, "Start," together.

459
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:59,380
- You picked Jong Kook. - No, no.

460
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:00,640
- Come on. - One person should spin it.

461
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:03,785
Actually, my finger wasn't on the roulette.

462
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,980
- Who said, "Start"? - You picked Jong Kook.

463
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:08,865
Kwang Soo, you should have kept your unlucky finger off of it.

464
00:18:10,492 --> 00:18:11,795
Where should we go first?

465
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,095
- Camellia will be pretty. - Let's go to Camellia Hill.

466
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:15,605
- I want to go there. - We will go to Camellia Hill.

467
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,935
- I love camellia. - Camellia Hill.

468
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:21,035
- Let's go and eat black cattle. - Black cattle?

469
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,305
- How about black cattle? - I want to eat meat noodles.

470
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,800
Aren't we eating black cattle?

471
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:28,345
- Did you think we would raise them? - We'd be eating it?

472
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,210
- We are only here for two days. - Hold on.

473
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,740
I get that you are annoyed,

474
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,680
- but don't snap at me. - Think about it.

475
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:35,325
We are in this together.

476
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,510
I don't belong in this team.

477
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,780
You belong in this team more than I do.

478
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:41,650
- I don't belong here. - We won't raise the black cattle.

479
00:18:41,657 --> 00:18:43,850
If they were red, I am yellow. I don't belong in this team.

480
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,020
- Hey. - For goodness' sake.

481
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:48,390
- You are taking forever. - Seriously.

482
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:50,005
We are going to eat meat noodles.

483
00:18:50,499 --> 00:18:52,500
What's taking you so long? Hurry up.

484
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,930
- We are set. - We just don't have the teamwork.

485
00:18:54,937 --> 00:18:56,470
Gosh, they are so annoying.

486
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:58,615
- Let's eat black cattle. - Let's do that.

487
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:03,145
Did the roulette point at my name?

488
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,280
Go, and do it.

489
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:08,410
- Stop the car. - Do it.

490
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:10,425
Hurry up, and run.

491
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,355
Run.

492
00:19:12,988 --> 00:19:14,095
- That's right. - Haha.

493
00:19:14,156 --> 00:19:15,650
What's wrong?

494
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:16,950
- Start driving. - What is he doing?

495
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,160
- Go. - Hey.

496
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm sorry.

497
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:20,820
(Will Haha think that he's the target?)

498
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,005
Was it me?

499
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:25,075
- Is it me? - I don't think it's you.

500
00:19:25,267 --> 00:19:26,535
It's not you.

501
00:19:28,337 --> 00:19:29,405
Okay.

502
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:31,105
It was enough to look suspicious.

503
00:19:31,907 --> 00:19:35,245
(Dark treasure of Jeju Island and arboretum)

504
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,970
Let's get to the black cattle ranch first.

505
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:38,615
- We're leaving. - Okay.

506
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:41,185
What's our strategy?

507
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,510
After eating,

508
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:45,120
if we see the other team, we'll tear off his name tag.

509
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,125
- Okay. - Finish at the mandarin trees.

510
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:49,550
- That's one bingo. - Is that bingo?

511
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:50,550
Listen.

512
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,660
- The center is the most important. - The center?

513
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,035
"Eliminating the name tag of the target".

514
00:19:54,596 --> 00:19:56,165
Why did we get Jong Kook?

515
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,135
How could our target be Jong Kook?

516
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,335
It was as if it were planned.

517
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:02,305
Teams were arranged if it were planned.

518
00:20:02,638 --> 00:20:04,030
- Gosh. - How is it possible?

519
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,340
- We should definitely win. - I agree.

520
00:20:06,341 --> 00:20:08,970
- We usually imagine the worst team. - Right.

521
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:11,015
This is the worst team that I've never imagined.

522
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,240
(It's the worst team ever.)

523
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:14,585
Is it the worst?

524
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,585
Who makes it the worst team?

525
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,280
Don't ask.

526
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,225
(You know the answer.)

527
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,890
(Are you talking about me?)

528
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,520
- Who do you think it is? - Pardon?

529
00:20:25,527 --> 00:20:26,995
Who makes this team the worst?

530
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,365
I'll show you what I have.

531
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:30,605
Get ready, everyone.

532
00:20:32,501 --> 00:20:35,105
This is great. It's perfect to drive in Jeju Island.

533
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,230
- It's the best. - When there are no cameras...

534
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:38,775
(She looks around carefully.)

535
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,685
This is great.

536
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,485
It feels...

537
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,040
like...

538
00:20:46,048 --> 00:20:47,440
(She hesitates.)

539
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:50,210
It's my first time being on a team with people...

540
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,555
who aren't weaker than me.

541
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:56,050
Se Chan and Kwang Soo...

542
00:20:56,058 --> 00:20:58,160
are around my age.

543
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,420
- That's true. - I feel comfortable with them.

544
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:01,265
I think Seok Jin is...

545
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,630
He's quite weak.

546
00:21:02,631 --> 00:21:04,600
- I don't have to be careful... - He's weak.

547
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,700
Around Seok Jin.

548
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:06,760
Seok Jin is weak.

549
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:09,330
It's my first time being around my seniors.

550
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:10,605
Seok Jin doesn't count.

551
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,000
So Min, have you been to Jeju Island often?

552
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,170
- Jeju Island? - Yes.

553
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,510
I used to live here.

554
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:18,440
- When? - It was when I was six.

555
00:21:18,447 --> 00:21:19,740
- Really? - I lived for about a year.

556
00:21:19,748 --> 00:21:21,750
- Really? - It was due to my dad's work.

557
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,610
- Did your father work here? - Yes.

558
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,380
Did he work in Jeju Island?

559
00:21:25,387 --> 00:21:27,925
During his stay here,

560
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:32,495
while he peed in the ocean in Jeju Island,

561
00:21:33,562 --> 00:21:36,830
- he caught an octopus. - Really?

562
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,300
- How did he? - As he peed,

563
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,460
the water turned warm.

564
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:41,305
An octopus came up from underneath the rocks.

565
00:21:41,637 --> 00:21:43,430
Your stories...

566
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,775
including about your father are strange.

567
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:47,400
- They're unbelievable. - They're strange.

568
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:49,670
- I agree. - You tell unbelievable stories.

569
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:53,040
It was my first time eating octopus that was freshly caught.

570
00:21:53,048 --> 00:21:55,250
- Really? - It was an octopus that...

571
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,185
- your father caught with his urine. - Yes.

572
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,420
It was surprised by the warmth.

573
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,480
- So Min. - Yes?

574
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:00,850
Do you have memories in Jeju Island?

575
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:01,850
Let me think.

576
00:22:01,857 --> 00:22:03,250
Have you come here with a boyfriend?

577
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:04,325
I have.

578
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,595
- Have you? - Yes.

579
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,490
Jeju Island.

580
00:22:08,497 --> 00:22:10,205
Did you come here alone with him?

581
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,935
Just us two.

582
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,330
You sound nostalgic.

583
00:22:16,338 --> 00:22:17,875
- "Just us two." - "Just us two."

584
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,715
- The woman... - However

585
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,545
that I loved the most got married.

586
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:24,370
That's great news.

587
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,255
(Jae Seok makes him feel worse.)

588
00:22:28,116 --> 00:22:29,210
- I think... - Seriously?

589
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,550
It's great for her.

590
00:22:30,552 --> 00:22:32,380
How dare you say that?

591
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:33,880
- Get out! - What's wrong?

592
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,050
- How could you? - What is it?

593
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:37,625
Don't ruin my beautiful memory.

594
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,420
- Gosh. - You probably gave her a hard time.

595
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:41,565
My goodness.

596
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,290
(Here they go again.)

597
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:44,600
But listen.

598
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,560
Just don't say anything.

599
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:49,145
Don't say anything after saying but.

600
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,230
- Stop it. - I'm getting...

601
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:53,840
- upset little by little. - The water looks great.

602
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:57,210
- Let's just win today. - Goodness.

603
00:22:57,212 --> 00:22:58,580
This is great.

604
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,515
- It's great. - Isn't it?

605
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:02,210
We're here.

606
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,285
(While they argue, they arrive at Camellia Hill.)

607
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:06,855
- Camellias bloom in the winter. - It's so windy.

608
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:09,650
- A song is called "Camellia Lady". - "Camellia Lady".

609
00:23:09,658 --> 00:23:13,535
- Countless numbers of - "Camellia Lady".

610
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:16,865
- Nights - Nights

611
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm thankful Jong Kook is a singer.

612
00:23:20,168 --> 00:23:23,005
If not, his voice sounds so weak.

613
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:28,970
Are you trying to pick a fight?

614
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,110
Jong Kook is a singer.

615
00:23:30,112 --> 00:23:31,580
- What do you mean? - Seriously.

616
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,140
- Jae Seok. - What did I say?

617
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:35,050
- He's trying to pick a fight. - It's just my opinion.

618
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:37,110
- Mr. Yu. - What is it?

619
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,920
We're having a good time today.

620
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,080
Wasn't that an attack?

621
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:42,750
What do you mean? I was only speaking my mind.

622
00:23:42,758 --> 00:23:44,050
- What's wrong with that? - Gosh.

623
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,720
Don't make it uncomfortable, and get out of the car.

624
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:46,820
He's strange.

625
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:47,820
- Let's get out first. - Do I take this with me?

626
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,165
(They don't stop arguing.)

627
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:52,335
- It's so windy. - Where do we go?

628
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,730
- The wind is warm. - It's warm.

629
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,905
It's warm today.

630
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,515
- There's sunlight. - The weather is...

631
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,800
- great today. - There's sunlight.

632
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:01,710
- I know. - Where are the camellias?

633
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,170
- Let's go. - Where are they?

634
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:04,270
(The best Camellia Hill in Asia)

635
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,415
This is amazing.

636
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:07,710
I didn't know there was a place like this.

637
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,250
- There are many new places here. - It's not cold.

638
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:12,280
- Are camellia flowers red or white? - They're red.

639
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:15,165
(With various camellia flowers from the world, it changes with seasons.)

640
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,360
(At this beautiful arboretum...)

641
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,420
What's that?

642
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:21,990
- It's Tray Karaoke. - It's Tray Karaoke.

643
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,290
- It is. - It's Tray Karaoke.

644
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,435
Gosh, it's Tray Karaoke.

645
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:26,875
Tray Karaoke?

646
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,105
(She's excited alone.)

647
00:24:29,538 --> 00:24:31,305
Look at these camellia flowers.

648
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,600
- They're pretty. - They're pretty, So Min.

649
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:35,270
- Are these camellia flowers? - I see.

650
00:24:35,277 --> 00:24:38,180
- I can't find where you are. - Jong Kook.

651
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,640
(Jong Kook makes So Min's heart flutter.)

652
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:41,785
Indeed.

653
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,755
I see you very clearly, So Min.

654
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,255
I see you clearly.

655
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,290
- Move. Don't hurt the flowers. - Hey.

656
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,550
So Min is a camellia.

657
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,025
- I'm a camellia. - She was.

658
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,020
Goodness.

659
00:24:52,027 --> 00:24:54,320
- You're at the first destination. - It's so beautiful here.

660
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,190
I was worried being in the car with Jong Kook,

661
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,865
but we didn't argue so much.

662
00:24:58,366 --> 00:25:00,930
- That's not it. - The way he drives is so different.

663
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,870
He wanted to pick a fight...

664
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:04,430
- No, his driving... - during the ride.

665
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,500
Made me want to fight.

666
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,470
- When we're in a big group... - They were close to arguing.

667
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,470
Jae Seok knows how to agitate people.

668
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:10,545
Sorry?

669
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:12,240
That jerk.

670
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,210
- Jae Seok is... - Let's sit down.

671
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:15,210
What do we do?

672
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,885
Your mission is called...

673
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,320
Camellia Flower Tray Karaoke.

674
00:25:19,321 --> 00:25:22,325
(Camellia Flower Tray Karaoke)

675
00:25:22,357 --> 00:25:24,350
You get five chances.

676
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,820
Sing "Camellia Lady" without making any mistakes.

677
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:29,190
(You must sing "Camellia Lady" without any mistakes to succeed.)

678
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,505
Then, you clear the mission.

679
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:33,275
If you make a mistake, the tray falls on you.

680
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:34,605
I know.

681
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:41,945
(This is a song by Lee Mi Ja, a famous Korean singer.)

682
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,415
Aren't you familiar with "Camellia Lady"?

683
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,485
You'll sing verse two.

684
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:49,685
Verse two?

685
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:52,680
- Wait a minute. - That's too harsh.

686
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,080
(Does anyone know the second verse?)

687
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,025
- You're really terrible. - Is this...

688
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:58,295
I hardly know the lyrics.

689
00:25:58,927 --> 00:26:00,120
The three Chance Cards are...

690
00:26:00,128 --> 00:26:02,490
listen to the whole song, listen to one measure, and changing seats.

691
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,465
You get two chances to use them.

692
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,075
Let's start right away.

693
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:07,530
You'll pick seats after listening.

694
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:08,605
Goodness.

695
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,300
Play the song.

696
00:26:11,306 --> 00:26:15,185
(The main song plays.)

697
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:18,140
(Try to memorize the lyrics with them.)

698
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:22,385
The story engraved on.

699
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:26,495
Camellia petals.

700
00:26:26,888 --> 00:26:30,665
With the secret story.

701
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:33,495
In her heart.

702
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:37,290
Camellia Lady.

703
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,300
(She murmurs to herself.)

704
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,535
Is.

705
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:49,485
Waiting.

706
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:57,285
When will her love come back

707
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,555
I don't know this song.

708
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:12,160
(This part is sung by the whole group.)

709
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,875
- I'm in trouble. - To the lonely camellia flower?

710
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,670
- "Camellia Lady is waiting". - My part is...

711
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:16,745
(It's difficult.)

712
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,975
- I'm in trouble. - You may not discuss.

713
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:21,200
- Pick a number. - Goodness.

714
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:22,610
I need number three.

715
00:27:22,611 --> 00:27:23,970
"Camellia Lady is waiting".

716
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,540
- "Camellia Lady waits"? - "Waiting".

717
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:27,115
- "Waiting". - You may not discuss.

718
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:28,325
We can't discuss?

719
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:29,485
You may not discuss.

720
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,310
- I need to pick number three. - What?

721
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,680
The story engraved on.

722
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:33,720
You may not discuss.

723
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:34,850
I'm number four.

724
00:27:34,856 --> 00:27:37,250
(Jae Seok picks his original seat.)

725
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:38,260
- What's your number? - Number one.

726
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,320
That's a relief.

727
00:27:39,327 --> 00:27:40,865
(Haha and So Min pick their original seats.)

728
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:41,990
(Everyone picks their original seats.)

729
00:27:41,997 --> 00:27:43,030
Wait, do it again.

730
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:44,260
- We didn't cheat. - We didn't.

731
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,560
- No way. - We didn't cheat.

732
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:47,000
- We didn't cheat. - We didn't do anything.

733
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:48,030
No way.

734
00:27:48,036 --> 00:27:49,070
- We swear. - We didn't do anything.

735
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,375
- I got goosebumps. - This is unbelievable.

736
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,300
- We got the same result. - I can't remember anyway.

737
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:54,300
- We only have four. - I don't...

738
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:55,685
I don't know the melody.

739
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:57,210
Let's play for now.

740
00:27:57,212 --> 00:27:58,640
(They sit in their original seats.)

741
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:01,650
If you discuss, you'll have to pick another number.

742
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,785
(It's their first attempt.)

743
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,010
Gosh.

744
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:05,080
(How will it turn out?)

745
00:28:05,086 --> 00:28:06,555
Please play the sound.

746
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:09,450
Music starts.

747
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:11,820
(It's their first try.)

748
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:17,390
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

749
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:19,460
The story.

750
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,005
What is he doing?

751
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,430
(The tray comes down.)

752
00:28:23,438 --> 00:28:25,240
Haha, how could you?

753
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,400
- The story - What?

754
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:27,975
What was that melody?

755
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:31,170
- I don't know the song. - What are your lyrics?

756
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,715
- It hurt. - "The story engraved on".

757
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:37,980
The story engraved on.

758
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:40,580
Camellias.

759
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,390
Isn't it "The story engraved on camellia petals"?

760
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,395
- I think so. - Isn't it camellia petals?

761
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:47,820
- With - With the secret story.

762
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,565
In her heart.

763
00:28:50,765 --> 00:28:53,060
Camellia Lady.

764
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:54,130
- You're terrible at singing. - Is.

765
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,430
- Waiting - So Min.

766
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:57,330
Can you sing with emotions?

767
00:28:57,339 --> 00:29:02,945
- Camellia Lady - Camellia Lady.

768
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:04,980
What was the last line?

769
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,480
(What was my part?)

770
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,640
- What? - It went...

771
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:09,350
(Are you serious?)

772
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:11,995
It went, "Wherever" or something like that.

773
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,225
"Or something like that"?

774
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,925
- What did you hear? - Seriously,

775
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:18,920
you should have at least heard a phrase.

776
00:29:18,927 --> 00:29:20,595
- Seriously... - Hold on.

777
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:23,290
Are there teams within this team?

778
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,360
- It's not like that. - It's not like that.

779
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:28,030
- We're all in this. - We all aim to succeed.

780
00:29:28,036 --> 00:29:29,805
- So Min, come here. - Jae Seok.

781
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:32,100
- Jae Seok. - Hey.

782
00:29:32,107 --> 00:29:33,340
Choose the right team.

783
00:29:33,341 --> 00:29:36,870
- Choose the right team. - He should know at least a little.

784
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:38,740
- So Min, are you sure? - Seriously...

785
00:29:38,747 --> 00:29:41,110
- You should've heard something. - You should have.

786
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,610
The thing is,

787
00:29:42,617 --> 00:29:44,610
I was flustered. I was listening to the beginning part.

788
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,680
Do you want to sleep on the ice rink tonight?

789
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:48,690
Sing the beginning part then.

790
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,650
- What? Hold on. - Sing the beginning part.

791
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:53,520
- What is he saying? - Sing the beginning part.

792
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:55,505
If it's correct, I'll let it slide.

793
00:29:56,131 --> 00:29:58,860
I'm sorry.

794
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,860
(I sincerely apologize.)

795
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:03,130
- I'm sorry. - You should have apologized.

796
00:30:03,138 --> 00:30:05,875
- The thing is... - Stop giving excuses.

797
00:30:06,107 --> 00:30:08,910
You can either hear the whole song, hear one line, or switch places.

798
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
- Okay. - Let's do this.

799
00:30:09,911 --> 00:30:11,170
You can use only two Chance Cards.

800
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,380
Why are you picking one yourself?

801
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,680
- Did you pick one? - It'll be the whole song.

802
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,785
(He's confident in his choice.)

803
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,655
- You're unlucky. - Hey!

804
00:30:21,389 --> 00:30:22,390
Why did you do it?

805
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,550
(They have only 2 chances, )

806
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:24,950
(and Jae Seok picked "switching places".)

807
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,720
- I shouldn't have done it. - Why did you do it on your own?

808
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,790
My team...

809
00:30:28,797 --> 00:30:30,965
No. You already picked one.

810
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:32,975
I can't believe you.

811
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:36,845
- But I... - He didn't even hear his line.

812
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:39,115
We're Team Senior Yu.

813
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:41,575
Our team was named after me.

814
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,770
That's just the team's name, nothing more.

815
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:46,840
- Aren't you going to say something? - We named the team after you,

816
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:48,625
- so pull yourself together. - Jae Seok.

817
00:30:49,217 --> 00:30:50,810
- Pull yourself together, will you? - Gosh.

818
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:53,020
- Are you serious? - Why did you do it on your own?

819
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,680
My goodness.

820
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:57,265
- Let's try. - Gosh.

821
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,120
- "The story"... - "On camellia petals"...

822
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,595
- "Engraved on camellia petals". - "Engraved on camellia petals".

823
00:31:00,895 --> 00:31:05,960
- Love engraved on camellia petals - The story engraved on.

824
00:31:05,967 --> 00:31:07,035
It's "the story".

825
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,030
It sounded like, "the story".

826
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,315
It doesn't suit the melody.

827
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:14,400
(The story engraved)

828
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:17,740
You sound so sly.

829
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,915
He's great.

830
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,910
- Sly? - He's amazing.

831
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,510
- You sound so sly. - Sly?

832
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,780
- You sound sly. - I sounded sly?

833
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:27,055
I'm short.

834
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:28,850
- I'm short. - You're short.

835
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:30,525
- Jong Kook is sly. - Sly?

836
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:31,725
I'm embarrassing.

837
00:31:32,427 --> 00:31:33,595
Exactly.

838
00:31:34,295 --> 00:31:35,890
- How did you know? - Let's draw a number.

839
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:36,890
(Let's switch places.)

840
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:40,135
- What was it? - The story.

841
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:42,445
- We're in trouble. - I'm number one.

842
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:46,675
- The story - Stop discussing.

843
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:48,045
- MR. - The story on.

844
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,570
- That must be it. - "Engraved on".

845
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:52,180
- "The story on"... - Play.

846
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,055
- The story on - Play the music.

847
00:31:54,115 --> 00:31:56,410
(They can't even agree on the first line.)

848
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:58,595
(Will their second try be successful?)

849
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:01,280
(Second try)

850
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:05,050
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

851
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:09,190
The story.

852
00:32:09,197 --> 00:32:11,290
On camellia petals.

853
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:13,435
- It's "engraved on". - It's "engraved on".

854
00:32:13,468 --> 00:32:15,730
(Jong Kook told you.)

855
00:32:15,737 --> 00:32:18,405
- It's "engraved on". - He deserves a beating.

856
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,875
You deserve a beating.

857
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:22,645
Come here.

858
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:24,370
Get up.

859
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:25,940
We're Team Senior Yu.

860
00:32:25,947 --> 00:32:28,110
- We're Team Senior Yu. - I didn't know my part.

861
00:32:28,116 --> 00:32:30,550
When you've done something wrong, you should be criticized.

862
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,595
You should learn to take criticism.

863
00:32:33,688 --> 00:32:35,790
Draw a Chance Card.

864
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,920
Draw one. Let Jong Kook do it.

865
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:38,960
Look.

866
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,265
(Let Jong Kook do it this time.)

867
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:48,435
(If he draws something bad, he'll feel bad.)

868
00:32:48,836 --> 00:32:51,100
Look. I'll show you.

869
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:54,575
(I'll show you all.)

870
00:32:54,909 --> 00:32:58,715
(Will it go as Jae Seok planned?)

871
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,085
Look. It's the whole song, see?

872
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:03,685
Go away.

873
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:07,055
Why can't you do this? Do you see this?

874
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:09,165
Apologize.

875
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,420
- Why? - Kiss his hand.

876
00:33:11,426 --> 00:33:12,995
Kiss his hand.

877
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:15,065
Kiss his hand.

878
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,705
Gosh.

879
00:33:16,898 --> 00:33:18,700
- Hey. - Focus.

880
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,660
Focus. Let's hear the whole song again.

881
00:33:20,668 --> 00:33:21,660
Okay.

882
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:22,870
- Gosh. - Good job.

883
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,515
Listen to others' parts too. I don't know my part.

884
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:29,170
All right. Play the music.

885
00:33:29,177 --> 00:33:33,415
(As their last chance, they hear the whole song again.)

886
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:41,680
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

887
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:43,690
(It's "engraved on".)

888
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,025
(The story engraved on camellia petals)

889
00:33:45,827 --> 00:33:46,820
(With the secret story in her heart)

890
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:52,300
(Listening carefully)

891
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,260
It's "in her heart".

892
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:55,970
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

893
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:57,270
"Camellia Lady is"...

894
00:33:57,272 --> 00:34:03,610
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

895
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:04,770
(Nodding)

896
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:07,155
(Camellia Lady is waiting)

897
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:16,050
(When will her love come back)

898
00:34:16,057 --> 00:34:17,265
What did she sing?

899
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:30,730
(To the lonely camellia flower?)

900
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:32,415
All right. It's "To the lonely camellia flower".

901
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,875
- I didn't hear my part. - Let's start right away.

902
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:37,445
- "When will"... - "To the lonely"...

903
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:39,380
- "To the lonely"... - What should I do?

904
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,740
- To the lonely... - Play...

905
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:44,110
- the music. - What was my part? The story...

906
00:34:44,118 --> 00:34:45,180
The story...

907
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:46,280
(Third try)

908
00:34:46,287 --> 00:34:48,825
- The story - "Engraved on"...

909
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,165
"Camellia petals".

910
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:55,990
The story on camellia petals.

911
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:57,065
It's "engraved on".

912
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,060
(He's wrong again.)

913
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,060
(Engraved!)

914
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:02,245
"Engraved", you idiot!

915
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:04,605
Let me engrave your body.

916
00:35:06,107 --> 00:35:08,370
I can't believe you guys.

917
00:35:08,376 --> 00:35:10,745
- How many times did I tell you? - Jae Seok!

918
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:12,680
Guys, say something.

919
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,740
How could you do this?

920
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:17,755
What are you doing?

921
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,255
- It's "engraved"... - What are you?

922
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:20,580
(Let me teach you a lesson.)

923
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:22,365
What are you doing?

924
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,650
- Hold on. - Let me take care of it.

925
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm sorry.

926
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,520
I can't believe it.

927
00:35:27,528 --> 00:35:29,430
- That's enough. - Is he a spy?

928
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:30,690
- Please ignore this one. - Are you a spy?

929
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:32,535
- Apologize to everyone. - What?

930
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,305
- What? - Apologize.

931
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:35,630
Apologize.

932
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:37,600
- I can't let it slide. - Hands on your belly.

933
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,475
- Okay. - Hands on your belly.

934
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,670
- Hands on your belly. - Hands on your belly.

935
00:35:42,677 --> 00:35:44,170
- I'm sorry. - There you go.

936
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:45,580
- Good. - Do you remember my part?

937
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,850
The story.

938
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:51,010
- It's "engraved on". - Okay.

939
00:35:51,018 --> 00:35:52,010
Let's try singing the whole thing.

940
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,025
Stop pointing your spoon at me.

941
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:57,750
- I've had enough. - I'm sorry.

942
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:01,195
If you sing it wrong again, I'll engrave your body.

943
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,290
(Haha is practicing diligently.)

944
00:36:03,297 --> 00:36:06,635
I don't know my part. When will her.

945
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:09,630
When will her love.

946
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:11,830
It was your part before.

947
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,200
- He didn't hear it. - I didn't hear that part.

948
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,385
- Why? - I was busy listening to mine.

949
00:36:16,477 --> 00:36:18,545
I don't remember what I heard in the beginning.

950
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,540
What?

951
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:22,910
- Tell her something. - How could I remember it?

952
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:24,610
- Can't you say anything? - When will her love...

953
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,920
(I remember it now.)

954
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:29,290
(When will her love come back)

955
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,920
- Good. - Let's start.

956
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:32,820
- Okay. - What was the last line?

957
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:33,820
The last line.

958
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:37,090
(To the lonely camellia flower?)

959
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,690
The lonely camellia flower blooms.

960
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,000
- What? - "To the lonely camellia flower".

961
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:42,030
The lonely camellia flower blooms.

962
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:44,805
- Isn't that a different song? - "To the lonely camellia flower".

963
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:46,475
All three of them got up.

964
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,270
To the lonely camellia flower?

965
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:51,645
Fine. Stay in your seats.

966
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,880
- We're here. - Okay.

967
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,215
- I've never seen black cattle. - Neither have I.

968
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,485
We're in Jeju Island. Is this Olle Trail?

969
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,180
- Are we on Olle Trail? - I think so.

970
00:37:01,189 --> 00:37:03,525
No, this is not Olle Trail.

971
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,425
It's somewhere else.

972
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,495
Just agree with him.

973
00:37:07,595 --> 00:37:09,490
- I'm sorry. - I really don't like him.

974
00:37:09,497 --> 00:37:11,290
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

975
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,435
You're number three.

976
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:16,105
- Hey. - What's that?

977
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:18,700
- What is this? - Is this all poop?

978
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:19,800
- It's all poop. - Really?

979
00:37:19,807 --> 00:37:21,000
It's all poop.

980
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:22,710
No. Oh, it is.

981
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,785
It is.

982
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:25,715
It's all poop?

983
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,685
It's poop.

984
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,550
I've never seen anything like this before.

985
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,385
(Are you surprised?)

986
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,620
The road is covered with poop.

987
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:35,590
- There's so much. - It's all poop.

988
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,590
Gosh.

989
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,620
(It's a poop trail.)

990
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,995
(Come here.)

991
00:37:40,228 --> 00:37:45,065
(They're struggling to get poop on each other.)

992
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:49,530
(They take hold of the team leader.)

993
00:37:49,537 --> 00:37:50,530
(He steps on it.)

994
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,700
Seok Jin stepped on poop.

995
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:56,245
(Look at Seok Jin. He stepped on poop.)

996
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,045
Don't sweat over this.

997
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:01,210
Focus on winning.

998
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:02,910
- I'll be lucky today. - Seok Jin stepped on poop.

999
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:03,910
(I'll be lucky.)

1000
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:06,180
- It's all poop. - Look at that.

1001
00:38:06,187 --> 00:38:07,680
(Look at the cows.)

1002
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:10,995
- But they're brown. - One of them is black.

1003
00:38:11,058 --> 00:38:12,695
- Where? - They're mixed.

1004
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,795
There are so many of them.

1005
00:38:15,196 --> 00:38:16,465
There are calves too.

1006
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,100
The black cattle you see over there are...

1007
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,860
- the treasure of Jeju Island. - Black cattle.

1008
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,045
(Jeju's treasure, black cattle)

1009
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,915
They were Jeju Island's specialty in the Joseon dynasty period.

1010
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,670
20 of them were offered to the king...

1011
00:38:29,677 --> 00:38:30,670
every year.

1012
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,815
(Black cattle are rare and taste good.)

1013
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,910
If you complete the black cattle mission,

1014
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:38,010
you'll win a Chance Card and a meal.

1015
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,720
(They can win a meal.)

1016
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,850
Will we get to eat black cattle?

1017
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:41,955
Really?

1018
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,225
- Okay. - Black cattle.

1019
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:44,520
We have to win it.

1020
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:45,935
This mission is...

1021
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,790
Cow Quiz.

1022
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:50,065
(Cow Quiz)

1023
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:52,335
If you get more than two questions right, you succeed.

1024
00:38:52,366 --> 00:38:54,360
It's a quiz related to cows.

1025
00:38:54,368 --> 00:38:55,670
- Cow Quiz? - It's a quiz?

1026
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,770
(They have to get two or more questions right.)

1027
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:58,705
- It's a quiz? - I'm bad at quizzes.

1028
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:01,570
- I'm really bad at quizzes. - It doesn't matter.

1029
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:03,770
- Don't say that in front of Ji Hyo. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1030
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:05,070
- That's rude. - She doesn't understand questions.

1031
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,680
- You're nothing compared to her. - I apologize.

1032
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:09,210
(You and Ji Hyo belong to different classes.)

1033
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:10,855
- You're not even close to her. - Kwang Soo.

1034
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,420
- Stop talking. - Are you making fun of her?

1035
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:16,150
- Don't take the title away from me. - She's worse than me.

1036
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:18,420
(Everyone in the team is bad at solving quizzes.)

1037
00:39:18,426 --> 00:39:20,920
(Can they win the Chance Card and Meal Card for black cattle?)

1038
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:23,165
- All right. First question. - Okay.

1039
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:25,565
You know the story "Minister Hwang Hui and the Farmer", right?

1040
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,270
- I don't know much about history. - What is that?

1041
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,005
(He's perplexed.)

1042
00:39:31,539 --> 00:39:34,275
(Minister Hwang Hui? I don't know much about history.)

1043
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,945
It was right after when Joseon had been established as a country.

1044
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:39,040
Hwang Hui at a young age was walking down the street.

1045
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,925
He met an old man, heading to the field with a brown and a black bull.

1046
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:46,820
Hwang Hui asked which one did a better job plowing the field.

1047
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,080
The man whispered to his ear,

1048
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:51,395
"This bull plows the field much better."

1049
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:56,305
Hwang Hui asked why the old man had whispered to him.

1050
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,360
He answered, "They have ears too."

1051
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:02,570
"If they hear they're not good, they won't be happy either."

1052
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,530
From this encounter, Hwang Hui had an epiphany.

1053
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:08,475
Then he carefully chose his words and became a wise prime minister.

1054
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,545
(Wait. This is similar to that.)

1055
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:13,240
The man covered their ears like he was playing the game, Of Course.

1056
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,110
(Was it similar to the game, Of Course on "X-Man"?)

1057
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:17,510
- No, it's not. - It's not?

1058
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,380
Kwang Soo, don't associate it with weird stuff.

1059
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:22,180
I mean, he covered the ears. Didn't he? Isn't it the same?

1060
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:24,125
- I know this. I got goose bumps. - Are you serious?

1061
00:40:24,325 --> 00:40:25,495
- Here's the question. - I really know this story.

1062
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,795
- In the story I told you, - I have a bad feeling about this.

1063
00:40:28,229 --> 00:40:31,790
The farmer said 1 of the 2 bulls did a better job.

1064
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,675
- Which bull was that? - Is it a multiple-choice question?

1065
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,535
Number One, the black bull.

1066
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,970
Number Two, the brown bull.

1067
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:38,230
(Ji Hyo is confused.)

1068
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,775
- It's 1 of those 2 choices? - Yes.

1069
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,600
- That's it? - It's 1 of those 2.

1070
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:42,945
- He picked 1 of the 2? - Kwang Soo, look.

1071
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:46,615
Kwang Soo, look. We are here to see the black cattle.

1072
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,225
- Black cattle. - So it must be the black bull.

1073
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,055
Or should we expect a twist?

1074
00:40:51,786 --> 00:40:53,155
Minister Hwang Hui...

1075
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:55,850
- "Hwang" means brown. - Hey.

1076
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:58,550
- Is it the same character though? - His name does have "Hwang" in it.

1077
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:01,195
- Are you sure it's the same one? - Yes, it is the same one.

1078
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,690
- Does "Hwang" mean brown? - Does he use the same character?

1079
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:07,930
(He does use the same Chinese character, but how is it relevant?)

1080
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:09,270
(What's Ji Hyo's answer?)

1081
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,405
I think it's the black one.

1082
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:12,875
- I was going to pick the opposite. - Is it the black one?

1083
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,275
- Should we do rock-paper-scissors? - Sure.

1084
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:17,740
- This is just among us. - Let's do whatever we want.

1085
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,615
- Or we won't make a decision. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1086
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,325
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo win.)

1087
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,610
- I really hope you win. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1088
00:41:24,618 --> 00:41:26,455
- I'll pick Number 1. You'll pick 2. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1089
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,180
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors.

1090
00:41:28,189 --> 00:41:30,350
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1091
00:41:30,357 --> 00:41:31,525
- Okay. - Which one will it be?

1092
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:33,360
- I sort of remember this. - What's your answer?

1093
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,620
(I think I know.)

1094
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,965
The brown bull. Number Two, brown bull.

1095
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,035
(Kwang Soo keeps saying he remembers the story and is confident.)

1096
00:41:42,069 --> 00:41:47,075
(Their opinions differ. Is his memory reliable?)

1097
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:50,570
- I told you! See? I told you. - My gosh. You got it right.

1098
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:53,215
(Kwang Soo's answer is correct.)

1099
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:54,740
- I knew it. - I kind of remember this.

1100
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:56,210
- My goodness, Kwang Soo. - It's because...

1101
00:41:56,217 --> 00:41:57,610
I was three when I heard it.

1102
00:41:57,618 --> 00:42:00,180
- When I went to bed, my mother... - The Chinese character...

1103
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,650
- When I went to bed, - Did that help?

1104
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,250
My mom read me this story at the bedside.

1105
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,660
(She read me "Minister Hwang Hui and the Farmer".)

1106
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,130
We managed to read the crew's thought. That's all.

1107
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,690
- Exactly. - Since there are black cattle.

1108
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:12,560
- Things are going well for us. - Hey.

1109
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:14,860
- That's what we did. - Let me be really objective.

1110
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,470
"We" didn't manage to do that. "I" got this right.

1111
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,930
- No, that's not true. - I disagree.

1112
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,300
- Kwang Soo. - I was going to pick the brown one.

1113
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,440
I won the rock-paper-scissors.

1114
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,510
- We all contributed to this win. - Then I picked the right one.

1115
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:25,170
- We all got the right answer. - Let's not do this.

1116
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:26,240
- Aren't you in the same team? - I...

1117
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:28,415
- The three of us... - They'll go to the ice rink.

1118
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,150
- I'll go to the suite. - Dream on, Kwang Soo.

1119
00:42:30,151 --> 00:42:32,720
(They will end up on the ice rink, and I'll be in the suite.)

1120
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,955
We are not in the same team.

1121
00:42:34,088 --> 00:42:35,950
- Okay. He did a good job after all. - Let's do this.

1122
00:42:35,956 --> 00:42:37,850
- Right. You did an excellent job. - Let's compliment him.

1123
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,660
- Why don't we pat him on the back? - Well done.

1124
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,895
- I'm serious. - Well done.

1125
00:42:41,195 --> 00:42:42,395
Great job.

1126
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,875
(His hand dives into the poop while being patted.)

1127
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:47,805
He touched the poop.

1128
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:51,330
(This is unbelievable. He dips his hand in the poop.)

1129
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,240
- Come on, Kwang Soo. Unbelievable. - That's disgusting.

1130
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,200
- That's nasty. - Go away. Stay away from us.

1131
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:56,310
(No way.)

1132
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,310
That's nasty.

1133
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:59,145
(He's having fun.)

1134
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:01,315
This is real poop.

1135
00:43:01,749 --> 00:43:03,085
This is real.

1136
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:04,655
- Wipe it there. - That's disgusting.

1137
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:05,710
We must get this right.

1138
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,655
- The staff members are flustered. - They are flustered now.

1139
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:08,850
Give us a harder one.

1140
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:10,450
- I was going to do that. - Sure. Take your shot at it.

1141
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:11,795
- Here's the second question. - Okay.

1142
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,420
You'll all take turns and answer it.

1143
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,620
(For this one, everyone must answer it.)

1144
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:18,965
Name a celebrity whose surname is So within 5 seconds.

1145
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,970
(That's not a common surname.)

1146
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,830
We will start with Kwang Soo. Get ready. Start.

1147
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:25,900
- One. - So Yu Jin.

1148
00:43:25,906 --> 00:43:26,940
- Two. - So Ji Sub.

1149
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:29,075
- 3, 4, - So... So Chan Whee.

1150
00:43:30,578 --> 00:43:35,540
(If Ji Hyo can answer, they'll get the Chance and Meal Cards.)

1151
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:40,980
(Can she think of one more celebrity whose surname is So?)

1152
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:42,155
Time is up!

1153
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,950
- So Dingfang. - Who is that?

1154
00:43:44,959 --> 00:43:46,860
There's a Chinese actor named So Dingfang.

1155
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,390
(He should've said that earlier.)

1156
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:49,990
Then why did you say So Ji Sub earlier?

1157
00:43:49,997 --> 00:43:51,665
(You should've gone with So Dingfang then.)

1158
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:54,760
(If he knew another one, why did he say So Ji Sub?)

1159
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,270
Then why did you say So Ji Sub earlier?

1160
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,900
- You shouldn't have used that one. - You...

1161
00:43:57,905 --> 00:43:59,440
(He turns on Kwang Soo for his action.)

1162
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,640
It was you.

1163
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:02,770
- Why did you say that? - You said that name.

1164
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:04,870
(He slaps Seok Jin with the dirty hand.)

1165
00:44:04,879 --> 00:44:07,710
- It was you who said his name. - You shouldn't have named him.

1166
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:12,720
(Kwang Soo's massage with his dirty hand enrages Seok Jin.)

1167
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,820
Stop it.

1168
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:16,225
(Because of So Dingfang, their unsanitary fight begins.)

1169
00:44:16,357 --> 00:44:17,750
This just turned into a fight of poop.

1170
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,335
(What are they doing?)

1171
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,195
Seriously.

1172
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:26,100
(Get this poop powder!)

1173
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,635
(I hate you guys.)

1174
00:44:28,669 --> 00:44:31,675
(We're staying away because you guys are disgusting.)

1175
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,100
All right. This is a quiz about a pun.

1176
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,945
I'm good at those.

1177
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,140
It's Pictionary.

1178
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:39,855
- We'll solve it together, right? - Yes.

1179
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:41,985
Look at this drawing.

1180
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:45,780
- Is that a pumpkin? - Guess the title of the drawing.

1181
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,455
(Guess the title of the drawing within 1 minute.)

1182
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:50,125
- Look at this. - The time limit is one minute.

1183
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:51,850
This is a cow.

1184
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:52,960
(The cow is looking at the burning flame.)

1185
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,820
- "My gosh, it's burning nicely." - Hey, keep quiet. Come on.

1186
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:58,365
- "A big loss for a small gain"? - Could it be a name of a celebrity?

1187
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,160
Or is it beef bulgogi?

1188
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,660
- Cow and the fire. - Cow...

1189
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:02,930
- Beef bulgogi. - Fluorine.

1190
00:45:02,937 --> 00:45:05,475
- The cow is looking at the fire. - Right.

1191
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,215
The fact that it's looking at the fire is important.

1192
00:45:07,408 --> 00:45:08,745
"Fire" by BTS?

1193
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,540
- Could it be BTS? - No, I don't think so.

1194
00:45:11,545 --> 00:45:13,680
Then tell us how many characters are in the title.

1195
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:15,715
- There are three. This is the hint. - Okay.

1196
00:45:15,816 --> 00:45:17,185
- He said there are 3. - 3 characters?

1197
00:45:17,318 --> 00:45:19,085
The cow is crossing its legs.

1198
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,620
Beef tripe.

1199
00:45:20,621 --> 00:45:22,480
(They don't have a clue, but time is ticking away.)

1200
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:23,725
A fable...

1201
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:25,650
- How could we get this right? - Hold on.

1202
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:27,120
- You set us up to fail. - Wait.

1203
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:28,390
We can tell you the answer, right?

1204
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,730
That's right. Tell us the answer.

1205
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,990
- 5, 4, - This isn't right. It's too hard.

1206
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,735
- 3, 2, 1. - This is too hard. Seriously.

1207
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:40,740
The answer is...

1208
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,605
(What's the title of the drawing in which a cow is looking at a fire?)

1209
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:56,865
The answer is...

1210
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:58,595
It's "Firefighter".

1211
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,290
I don't get the last character.

1212
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,720
- The cow is neglecting it. - It's neglecting the fire.

1213
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:03,235
My gosh. Are you serious?

1214
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,790
You failed to finish your mission.

1215
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,430
- But the thing is... - It's securing the fire.

1216
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:07,700
If it's "Gall Bladder",

1217
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:09,670
- shouldn't it hold its stomach? - No, it's "Firefighter".

1218
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,100
(It means the cow has to pee.)

1219
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:12,705
- No, it's "Firefighter". - "Firefighter".

1220
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:14,240
I'm sorry.

1221
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:16,785
- How could you mix those two? - My apologies.

1222
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,145
I can't believe he's in my team.

1223
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:20,810
He's the worst among us.

1224
00:46:20,814 --> 00:46:21,810
- I'll give up. - He's the worst among us.

1225
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:24,580
I will just go to the ice rink.

1226
00:46:24,585 --> 00:46:27,525
Kwang Soo, please be nice even though I'm bad at this.

1227
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:29,280
All right. You failed to accomplish your mission.

1228
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,965
(Do you think you can win the stickers like this?)

1229
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:33,290
- When will her love - You'll start now.

1230
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,260
- Hey, hey. - We were so close.

1231
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:36,905
We were so close even though Jae Seok messed up.

1232
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,930
- He made the same mistake twice. - Fine. I got it.

1233
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,235
Why don't you get rid of me then?

1234
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:43,200
I am planning on it. How did you figure that out?

1235
00:46:43,203 --> 00:46:44,270
(Stop fighting, and try finishing it.)

1236
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:45,330
All right. Here we go.

1237
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,470
- Play the song, please. - What's my first line?

1238
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,945
- "The story"... - "The story"...

1239
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:50,810
- "engraved on"... - "engraved on"...

1240
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,555
(They only have 2 chances left. They must go past the first verse.)

1241
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:58,580
The story engraved.

1242
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:02,220
On camellia petals.

1243
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:04,620
With a secret.

1244
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,890
(He gets it wrong.)

1245
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:07,390
- What just happened? - Hey, that hurts.

1246
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:09,260
(The trays come down during the second line.)

1247
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:11,865
- What just happened? What is it? - I can't believe you.

1248
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:14,860
- It's correct up to "with". - What did you say?

1249
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:16,570
- It's correct up to "with". - With...

1250
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:17,570
- See? - What are you going to do?

1251
00:47:17,571 --> 00:47:19,205
- You nagged me, but you messed up. - Look.

1252
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,270
If you didn't mess up before,

1253
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:23,885
I would've fixed the lyrics and got them right this time.

1254
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:26,485
Is it my fault?

1255
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,280
Is this my fault?

1256
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:29,340
(They get violent.)

1257
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:31,755
It's hard to be with this team.

1258
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:33,450
So Min, is it my fault?

1259
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,620
- Listen. - It's better to lose.

1260
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:35,850
- I think... - It's because...

1261
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,790
Is this our last chance?

1262
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,365
(This is exhausting.)

1263
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,860
Here's your last chance.

1264
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,220
Let's give each other a chance.

1265
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:43,930
- "With the secret story" - Let's do it.

1266
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:46,030
- Come here. - These are the lyrics.

1267
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:47,500
"With the secret story."

1268
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,770
- With the secret story - With the secret story.

1269
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,445
- In her heart - In her heart, that's right.

1270
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:59,370
- Camellia Lady is - Camellia Lady is.

1271
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,410
Raise the tone.

1272
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:05,180
- Waiting - Waiting.

1273
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:08,525
When will her love.

1274
00:48:08,856 --> 00:48:11,620
- When will her love come - That's wrong.

1275
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,295
- When will her - When will her love come back?

1276
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:15,920
When will her... I can't do it.

1277
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,490
The melody is wrong.

1278
00:48:17,498 --> 00:48:18,560
- We'll start after we get it. - Hey.

1279
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:20,635
What are the lyrics?

1280
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,175
When will her love.

1281
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,870
- Come back - Come back.

1282
00:48:25,873 --> 00:48:27,970
- "When will her love"... - "Come back".

1283
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:31,310
- "Come back". - Is Jong Kook giving a lesson?

1284
00:48:31,311 --> 00:48:32,385
What?

1285
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:34,085
We have to hurry up.

1286
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:36,650
Goodness.

1287
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,755
Let's sing the last measure together.

1288
00:48:37,784 --> 00:48:40,720
- To the lonely - To the lonely.

1289
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:43,490
- Camellia Lady - Camellia flower?

1290
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,490
- It's not "lady". - Isn't it?

1291
00:48:44,491 --> 00:48:45,750
Camellia Lady.

1292
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:46,890
- It's not "lady". - Isn't it?

1293
00:48:46,894 --> 00:48:48,490
Camellia.

1294
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:51,660
(The last measure is the problem.)

1295
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:53,100
(They get serious.)

1296
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,945
To the lonely.

1297
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:01,200
- Camellia flower? - Camellia flower?

1298
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,400
"To the lonely camellia flower?"

1299
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,710
- I'm worried. - Let's do it.

1300
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,070
This is your last chance.

1301
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:06,310
(If they fail, they won't win any Bingo Sticker.)

1302
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:08,240
Camellia Lady.

1303
00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:09,755
Wait, with the secret story...

1304
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:10,810
- This is the melody. - "With the secret story".

1305
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:13,420
- Play music. - "The story engraved on".

1306
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,420
Play music.

1307
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:15,450
- "Camellia petals". - "Camellia petals".

1308
00:49:15,455 --> 00:49:16,565
"The story engraved on".

1309
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:21,820
The story engraved on.

1310
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:25,690
Camellia petals.

1311
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,530
With the secret story.

1312
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:32,545
In her heart.

1313
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:36,715
(Jong Kook sings correctly.)

1314
00:49:36,977 --> 00:49:39,580
Camellia Lady is.

1315
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,580
(Jong Kook guides him.)

1316
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:42,910
Waiting.

1317
00:49:42,916 --> 00:49:44,025
That's right.

1318
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:50,220
Camellia Lady.

1319
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:52,925
(Haha sings the third measure successfully.)

1320
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,835
(Next is So Min.)

1321
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:59,600
(She seemed unsure during the last practice.)

1322
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:05,545
(Will So Min sing the correct lyrics?)

1323
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:09,710
When will her love.

1324
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:13,585
Come back.

1325
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:17,155
(She sings correctly.)

1326
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:23,120
(They clear the mission if they sing the last measure correctly.)

1327
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:25,020
(Will they make it without any mistake?)

1328
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:30,835
- Camellia flower? - Camellia flower?

1329
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:35,505
(This must be correct.)

1330
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:43,370
(They clear the mission miraculously.)

1331
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:45,670
(We can't believe that we did it.)

1332
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:46,680
We got it.

1333
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,640
- Goodness. - It was difficult.

1334
00:50:48,649 --> 00:50:49,680
It was really difficult.

1335
00:50:49,683 --> 00:50:51,225
- It was difficult. - It was hard.

1336
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:52,710
Still...

1337
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,120
- We did it. - Of course.

1338
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,120
We barely made it.

1339
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:58,525
(Camellia Hill is cleared.)

1340
00:50:58,625 --> 00:50:59,760
There's a piece of paper.

1341
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,435
- Meat noodles. - We'll pick...

1342
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:02,890
- meat noodles. - Okay.

1343
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:03,930
(Let's go eat meat noodles.)

1344
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,190
Before you go,

1345
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:08,330
you need to pick a Chance Card.

1346
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:10,700
(It's time to pick another Chance Card.)

1347
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:11,730
We have no choice, right?

1348
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:13,140
(We have to pick a good one.)

1349
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,540
There are...

1350
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:17,410
Steal Card, Cancel Card,

1351
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:20,655
Exchange Card, and Dud. It's a total of four.

1352
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:22,355
- I'll pick if you don't want to. - How about this?

1353
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:23,750
- Let's pick. - I'll pick if you don't want to.

1354
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,350
(Jong Kook picks a Chance Card.)

1355
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:26,425
We picked one.

1356
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:29,380
- That's great. It's Steal Card. - Steal Card.

1357
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,990
(Team Senior Yu picks a Steal Card.)

1358
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:34,490
(Let's steal Team Junior Jee's land.)

1359
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:35,635
Do we get to steal it?

1360
00:51:35,896 --> 00:51:37,160
That's right.

1361
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,735
Where did they go?

1362
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:39,830
They went to see black cattle.

1363
00:51:39,833 --> 00:51:41,100
This one? That's good.

1364
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,860
We can pick the same, right?

1365
00:51:42,869 --> 00:51:45,330
Take off the sticker...

1366
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,445
and put it on the black cattle.

1367
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:50,010
Why?

1368
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:51,815
(Why would we take ours off?)

1369
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:54,655
The other team picked a Steal Card. You stole from each other.

1370
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,925
- Goodness. - Did they steal too?

1371
00:51:59,186 --> 00:52:01,680
(They ended up switching their land.)

1372
00:52:01,688 --> 00:52:03,195
We should have picked a Cancel Card.

1373
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:10,005
(Team Junior Jee picks a Steal Card.)

1374
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,760
(They steal Camellia Hills from Team Senior Yu.)

1375
00:52:15,769 --> 00:52:19,505
(The teams switch places.)

1376
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,640
Let's go while showing off.

1377
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,470
- Let's go to mandarin trees. - Let's go.

1378
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:24,610
- Go to mandarin tress. - Let's go to mandarin trees.

1379
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:25,715
Let's go.

1380
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,155
We work quite well as a team.

1381
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:30,180
We can say that if we win.

1382
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:31,180
Let's win.

1383
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:33,085
However, if we lose,

1384
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:36,925
we can't ever be on the same team.

1385
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:39,290
What about just once more?

1386
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:40,290
- If we lose... - Just once more.

1387
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:42,220
Let's surprise everyone today...

1388
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:44,030
instead of betraying each other.

1389
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,760
There's no reason to betray each other.

1390
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:47,000
(They promise not to betray each other.)

1391
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,845
Wait, Haha sent me a text message.

1392
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:54,340
(Did he send Team Senior Yu's secret information?)

1393
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:55,445
What did he say?

1394
00:52:55,809 --> 00:52:58,715
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1395
00:52:59,146 --> 00:53:00,485
- Goodness. - What is it?

1396
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,680
(Was the text message related to Kwang Soo?)

1397
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:04,780
Who is it from?

1398
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:08,120
Kwang Soo sent a message to Haha.

1399
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:09,480
I sent it a long time ago.

1400
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:10,890
It was a long time ago.

1401
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:12,365
"Haha, please pick me."

1402
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,290
"My team is hopeless."

1403
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:18,235
"I'll do anything for you. I'll help you win."

1404
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,030
I sent that before the game.

1405
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:21,930
- Let's check the time. - Before the game.

1406
00:53:21,935 --> 00:53:23,030
(Kwang Soo tried to be a spy.)

1407
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,270
- Kwang Soo. - It was a long time ago.

1408
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:25,505
It was during my childhood.

1409
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,100
My goodness.

1410
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:29,240
(It was 10 minutes ago.)

1411
00:53:29,242 --> 00:53:32,070
I think everyone got a text message.

1412
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:33,980
- Let me check. - "Please pick me."

1413
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,410
"My team is hopeless."

1414
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:36,580
"I'll do anything for you."

1415
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,150
- Is it from Kwang Soo? - "I'll help you win."

1416
00:53:38,151 --> 00:53:39,685
He also sent me a message...

1417
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:40,720
a while ago.

1418
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,220
I'll forward it to Seok Jin and Se Chan.

1419
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:44,290
That's a good idea.

1420
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:45,290
(He tells on Kwang Soo.)

1421
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:46,760
- Before we left... - Well,

1422
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,120
it could be before we left.

1423
00:53:48,128 --> 00:53:49,395
Do you think I'd do the same?

1424
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,790
- Gosh, Kwang Soo. - Would I do the same?

1425
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:53,700
That was harsh, Kwang Soo.

1426
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:54,830
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1427
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,675
Stop thinking about betraying.

1428
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,170
- It's already late. - You should think about winning.

1429
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,200
I agree.

1430
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:01,415
I'll be honest. I wasn't going to say it.

1431
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:03,785
I had a big dream.

1432
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,240
What dream?

1433
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:06,655
- Winning alone? - By sending the message,

1434
00:54:07,681 --> 00:54:10,985
I wanted to use it against them.

1435
00:54:13,186 --> 00:54:14,220
Come on, Kwang Soo.

1436
00:54:14,221 --> 00:54:15,855
Okay, goodness.

1437
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,765
He totally fooled us.

1438
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:20,260
- Kwang Soo. - Seriously.

1439
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,195
You're a piece of trash.

1440
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:24,790
- You're a piece of trash. - Kwang Soo.

1441
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:25,830
You're creeping me out.

1442
00:54:25,832 --> 00:54:27,200
I wanted to use it.

1443
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,100
- Drop the subject. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1444
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,545
Can't you understand it?

1445
00:54:31,037 --> 00:54:32,470
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1446
00:54:32,472 --> 00:54:34,675
(Seok Jin does something on his phone.)

1447
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:36,985
- This is frustrating. - I tried to use it against them.

1448
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,215
- This is frustrating. - I tried to use it against them.

1449
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:41,580
Wait, Seok Jin.

1450
00:54:41,581 --> 00:54:43,080
Did you send a text message?

1451
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,080
No.

1452
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:45,310
Did you send a text message?

1453
00:54:45,318 --> 00:54:47,280
- No, how could I? - What?

1454
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:49,455
- Seok Jin. - I didn't.

1455
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:52,020
Ji Hyo, verify it with Jae Seok.

1456
00:54:52,025 --> 00:54:53,050
(They call Jae Seok to verify.)

1457
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:55,065
- You can't do that as our leader. - You're frustrating.

1458
00:54:55,795 --> 00:54:57,105
Ji Hyo.

1459
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,090
Did Seok Jin send you a text message?

1460
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,430
Yes, he did.

1461
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,200
(He answers without hesitating.)

1462
00:55:02,202 --> 00:55:03,470
- Seok Jin! - Seok Jin.

1463
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,600
What if I didn't notice?

1464
00:55:05,605 --> 00:55:06,640
(He's another cheater.)

1465
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,700
- What's wrong with everyone? - No.

1466
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,310
- This is wrong. - What if I didn't notice?

1467
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:11,810
This is wrong, Seok Jin.

1468
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,980
What did Seok Jin say in his message?

1469
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,340
He said that he's an X-man...

1470
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:17,280
and will destroy the team.

1471
00:55:17,284 --> 00:55:20,950
(Jae Seok repeats exactly what Seok Jin wrote him.)

1472
00:55:20,954 --> 00:55:22,855
Stop it. Goodness.

1473
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:24,690
- Hey. - Forget it, Seok Jin.

1474
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,150
It's our strategy.

1475
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,735
What's wrong with him?

1476
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:29,965
This is driving me crazy.

1477
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:33,005
- We got it. - My plan worked perfectly.

1478
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:35,100
- I knew it. - They'll be...

1479
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,470
- completely fooled by us. - They'll be fooled.

1480
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,545
They'll fall for it.

1481
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,470
- I knew it. - Seok Jin.

1482
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,770
The other team is...

1483
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:43,100
- in my hands. - Right.

1484
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:45,140
- I knew it. We have... - They're in my hands.

1485
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:46,470
Control over them.

1486
00:55:46,479 --> 00:55:48,655
- This is ridiculous. - Okay.

1487
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:49,840
We'll win today.

1488
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:52,185
(They head for the mandarin tree mission.)

1489
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:53,850
Is it in the middle of a city?

1490
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:56,055
Is there a mandarin farm in the city?

1491
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:57,620
Look to the front.

1492
00:55:57,624 --> 00:55:58,990
(Look at that.)

1493
00:55:58,992 --> 00:56:00,390
- It suddenly appeared. - It's great.

1494
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:01,760
It suddenly appeared.

1495
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:04,465
- There's a view of nature. - What's that?

1496
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:06,190
It's a house with a stone fence.

1497
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,635
Is there a mandarin farm here?

1498
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:09,275
This is it.

1499
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,130
The tree in the back...

1500
00:56:12,138 --> 00:56:14,640
was planted in 1911. It's the first mandarin tree in Jeju Island.

1501
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,215
- In 1911? - It was in 1911.

1502
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:18,670
- What? Was it in 1911? - "To express gratitude..."

1503
00:56:18,678 --> 00:56:20,810
"for King cherry trees sent from Korea,."

1504
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:23,280
"Japan sent 14 mandarin trees."

1505
00:56:23,283 --> 00:56:25,310
"The first one was planted in Jeju Island."

1506
00:56:25,318 --> 00:56:28,220
(It's the first Jeju mandarin tree.)

1507
00:56:28,221 --> 00:56:30,690
- It's... - The tree is older than Seok Jin.

1508
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,025
- Right. - It's much older than him.

1509
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,865
Do mandarins grow?

1510
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:36,020
- It's very old. - Do mandarins still grow?

1511
00:56:36,029 --> 00:56:37,405
- Yes. - Do they still grow?

1512
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:39,790
There they are.

1513
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:41,000
- There's one. - They're on the tree.

1514
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,435
- There are two. - Really?

1515
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:43,670
They're really there.

1516
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,045
They must be expensive.

1517
00:56:45,338 --> 00:56:46,700
Here's your next mission.

1518
00:56:46,706 --> 00:56:47,740
(What's their mission?)

1519
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:49,600
It's called Find This Person in Jeju Island.

1520
00:56:49,609 --> 00:56:51,710
(Find This Person in Jeju Island)

1521
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:55,180
Find a person who's native to Jeju Island without a mandarin tree...

1522
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:58,080
neither at his home nor at his relatives'.

1523
00:56:58,084 --> 00:56:59,410
- Then you clear the mission. - Relatives?

1524
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:00,720
- I see. - What do you mean relatives?

1525
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,880
Up to cousins.

1526
00:57:01,888 --> 00:57:03,950
- They must live in an apartment. - Right.

1527
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:05,120
(Mandarins are a specialty in Jeju Island.)

1528
00:57:05,125 --> 00:57:09,135
(Does every other person in Jeju Island own a mandarin tree?)

1529
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:13,165
(I have mandarin trees in the yard. We grow mandarins too.)

1530
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,835
(There are only mandarin trees. We have mandarin trees at home.)

1531
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:17,570
I heard that...

1532
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,030
mandarin trees are very common.

1533
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,740
- They're everywhere? - Everyone has a tree at home.

1534
00:57:21,741 --> 00:57:23,685
But there are so many apartment buildings.

1535
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:25,670
(Will they be able to find someone who has no mandarin trees?)

1536
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:26,910
Just find one person.

1537
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:28,380
- You don't have much time. Hurry. - Let's go.

1538
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:30,510
It might not take so long.

1539
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,185
If we're lucky, we might find someone soon.

1540
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,350
It might not take so long.

1541
00:57:35,355 --> 00:57:36,380
Here.

1542
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,950
(He drives the car for the staff.)

1543
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:40,965
- Hello. - Hello.

1544
00:57:41,227 --> 00:57:43,565
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes.

1545
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,590
Do you have mandarin trees at home?

1546
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:49,930
(Do you have mandarin trees at home?)

1547
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:51,145
Yes, I do.

1548
00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:53,470
- I see. Thank you. - Yes, I do.

1549
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,940
(He has mandarin trees.)

1550
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:56,240
- Thank you. - Mandarins taste good.

1551
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:57,315
They do.

1552
00:57:58,111 --> 00:58:00,680
- Most own mandarin trees, right? - Yes.

1553
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,640
Do you know anyone...

1554
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:05,080
who doesn't have mandarin trees?

1555
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:06,110
- There aren't many. - See?

1556
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,120
We're looking for someone...

1557
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:10,965
whose relatives don't have mandarin trees either.

1558
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,425
There won't be many.

1559
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,795
- 80 percent will have them. - 80 percent?

1560
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:17,130
We'll have to find the 20 percent.

1561
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,560
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1562
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:19,735
Thank you.

1563
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,200
(It might be harder than we thought.)

1564
00:58:21,201 --> 00:58:23,275
- My goodness. - How are we going to find them?

1565
00:58:23,703 --> 00:58:25,145
I see no people.

1566
00:58:26,272 --> 00:58:28,770
- There are no people. - It's Monday.

1567
00:58:28,775 --> 00:58:29,800
(The street is empty.)

1568
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:30,870
Everyone must be working.

1569
00:58:30,877 --> 00:58:33,010
I can't believe this. Cheonjiyeon Waterfall is near here.

1570
00:58:33,012 --> 00:58:34,580
- Where? - Cheonjiyeon Waterfall...

1571
00:58:34,581 --> 00:58:37,985
Won't there be a lot of people from Jeju Island there?

1572
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:40,720
Isn't it too far?

1573
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,280
Look at that sign.

1574
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,220
- Where? - Over there.

1575
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:45,390
It's behind that tree.

1576
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:49,065
Hey, it doesn't mean that the waterfall is near here.

1577
00:58:49,395 --> 00:58:50,530
The sign is just to say...

1578
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:51,930
it's in that direction.

1579
00:58:51,931 --> 00:58:53,505
It might be 50km away.

1580
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,930
I'm sorry, but we're a team.

1581
00:58:55,935 --> 00:58:58,200
- She just didn't make sense. - Listen to...

1582
00:58:58,204 --> 00:58:59,945
your team members.

1583
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:01,175
I'll find someone.

1584
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:04,110
- Hello, sir. - Ask him.

1585
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,745
(Polite)

1586
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:08,140
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes. I live over there.

1587
00:59:08,148 --> 00:59:09,755
Are you from here?

1588
00:59:10,016 --> 00:59:11,850
Do you have mandarin trees?

1589
00:59:11,851 --> 00:59:13,385
(Step 2)

1590
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,795
I don't.

1591
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:18,290
What about...

1592
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:20,120
Does any of your relatives...

1593
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:22,820
have mandarin trees?

1594
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:23,930
Your cousins.

1595
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,400
(They found someone who is from here and doesn't have mandarin trees.)

1596
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:30,445
(Do his relatives have mandarin trees?)

1597
00:59:30,537 --> 00:59:32,030
My in-laws do.

1598
00:59:32,038 --> 00:59:34,270
(My relatives do.)

1599
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:36,040
(I see.)

1600
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,785
His in-laws...

1601
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:39,910
- His relatives do. - Thank you.

1602
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:40,910
Thank you.

1603
00:59:40,914 --> 00:59:42,310
- His in-laws do. - Thank you.

1604
00:59:42,315 --> 00:59:43,415
I wish your family happiness.

1605
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:46,210
It's hard.

1606
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,920
Their relatives have mandarin trees.

1607
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,880
Someone might be allergic to mandarins.

1608
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:52,365
If we find that person, we'll succeed.

1609
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:53,565
That's right.

1610
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:55,760
- If the whole family is allergic... - Exactly.

1611
00:59:55,762 --> 00:59:57,135
There's a supermarket.

1612
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:00,700
Does any of your relatives have mandarin trees?

1613
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,775
Yes.

1614
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,470
- My aunt does. - Your aunt.

1615
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,775
Do you have mandarin trees?

1616
01:00:06,873 --> 01:00:09,300
Why? I do.

1617
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,110
- We're asking around. - I hope...

1618
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,885
your trees will grow well.

1619
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,080
Thank you.

1620
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:15,140
(Culture shock)

1621
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:17,255
- Here. - Please.

1622
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,655
Hello.

1623
01:00:19,118 --> 01:00:22,455
Are you from Jeju Island?

1624
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,225
- Are you from Jeju Island? - Yes.

1625
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,220
Do you have mandarin trees?

1626
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:29,465
- No. - Okay.

1627
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:30,930
- The final question. - The final question.

1628
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,830
Does any of your relatives have mandarin trees?

1629
01:00:34,834 --> 01:00:35,905
- Your cousins. - Your cousins.

1630
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,775
(What's his answer?)

1631
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,775
No.

1632
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,115
We found him.

1633
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,510
(They finally found someone.)

1634
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:46,910
- We found him. - Thank you.

1635
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:47,985
We found him.

1636
01:00:48,014 --> 01:00:50,040
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1637
01:00:50,049 --> 01:00:51,050
Happy New Year.

1638
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,585
Let's buy one of these.

1639
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:54,850
- Mission complete. - Okay.

1640
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:55,880
(They found someone after 30 minutes.)

1641
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:56,965
Thank you.

1642
01:00:57,724 --> 01:00:59,390
(They finally completed the mission.)

1643
01:00:59,392 --> 01:01:01,660
- We succeeded. - There were no more people to ask.

1644
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:02,820
- The mandarin tree. - Okay.

1645
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:05,365
We can complete the whole mission soon.

1646
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:06,590
- We'll be done soon. - We have only one more.

1647
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:07,600
Let's go there.

1648
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:08,660
(They only have to visit the shape of Korean Peninsula.)

1649
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:11,045
- We have to win a Chance Card. - That's right.

1650
01:01:11,104 --> 01:01:12,200
It's important.

1651
01:01:12,205 --> 01:01:13,715
Who wants to draw it?

1652
01:01:13,973 --> 01:01:15,040
Chance Cards...

1653
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,040
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1654
01:01:16,042 --> 01:01:18,610
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1655
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:19,570
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

1656
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,580
Rock-paper-scissors.

1657
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,680
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1658
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,355
Rock-paper-scissors.

1659
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,680
(Se Chan wins.)

1660
01:01:24,684 --> 01:01:25,850
Okay.

1661
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:27,195
- Se Chan... - Pick one.

1662
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:28,880
He's unlucky.

1663
01:01:28,888 --> 01:01:30,695
- Just avoid the dud. - Just avoid the dud.

1664
01:01:31,724 --> 01:01:33,550
(What does his reaction mean?)

1665
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,695
Oh, my.

1666
01:01:38,164 --> 01:01:40,190
(Dud)

1667
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,760
How can this be possible?

1668
01:01:41,768 --> 01:01:43,105
(He picked the dud.)

1669
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:47,040
(We won't say anything.)

1670
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,775
How can this be possible?

1671
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,740
I have nothing to say.

1672
01:01:51,744 --> 01:01:52,985
(Why did you win rock-paper-scissors?)

1673
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,310
- I think... - I mean...

1674
01:01:54,314 --> 01:01:56,310
we're meant to sleep in the ice rink.

1675
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:57,850
- How can I pick the dud? - Come here.

1676
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,350
Come here.

1677
01:01:59,352 --> 01:02:00,655
I can't believe it.

1678
01:02:00,853 --> 01:02:01,925
The other team...

1679
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:05,165
completed the meat noodle mission.

1680
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:07,065
We have to go there then.

1681
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,095
And...

1682
01:02:09,495 --> 01:02:11,530
- the other team... - No way.

1683
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:12,905
Picked an Exchange Card.

1684
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:16,275
Black cattle and Camellia Hill got switched again.

1685
01:02:16,669 --> 01:02:18,345
(Then it means...)

1686
01:02:18,671 --> 01:02:20,815
They must want to eliminate the name tag.

1687
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,640
It seems so.

1688
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:23,815
Then we could try to do that too.

1689
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,215
That's right.

1690
01:02:25,979 --> 01:02:27,055
We can win that way.

1691
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,940
- That's right. - Let's avoid it.

1692
01:02:28,948 --> 01:02:31,010
- Exchange Card or... - We'll go there...

1693
01:02:31,017 --> 01:02:32,925
- and there. - There.

1694
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:34,920
We'll go to the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1695
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:35,955
Let's go.

1696
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,950
We'll pick a Chance Card here and...

1697
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:39,950
- They want to remove the name tag. - It's hard.

1698
01:02:39,959 --> 01:02:41,135
(How will their strategy pay off?)

1699
01:02:41,627 --> 01:02:43,220
Everyone seems to be enjoying.

1700
01:02:43,229 --> 01:02:44,805
It looks so tasty.

1701
01:02:45,531 --> 01:02:47,005
Four bowls will be served.

1702
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:49,835
I can't wait to taste it.

1703
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:50,870
It's coming.

1704
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,270
(Steaming)

1705
01:02:52,271 --> 01:02:53,675
- It's... - It's steaming.

1706
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:56,640
(Thick pork broth)

1707
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:57,640
- It's... - Thank you.

1708
01:02:57,643 --> 01:02:58,810
(It's been boiled for many hours.)

1709
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:00,580
The broth looks so thick.

1710
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,410
It looks so tasty.

1711
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:04,410
(60 years of history)

1712
01:03:04,417 --> 01:03:06,155
It looks amazing.

1713
01:03:06,853 --> 01:03:09,155
- Let's try. - It looks so...

1714
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:12,195
It has 60 years of history.

1715
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:15,195
(Slurping)

1716
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:18,930
(Enjoying)

1717
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:20,330
- How does it taste? - Good.

1718
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:22,260
(Slurping)

1719
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:23,260
It tastes good.

1720
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:24,470
(She slurps the noodles.)

1721
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:25,545
It tastes very good.

1722
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:28,770
(The tasty noodles...)

1723
01:03:28,775 --> 01:03:30,885
(fill her mouth.)

1724
01:03:31,878 --> 01:03:33,385
It was worth our efforts.

1725
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,140
(The family is finally at peace.)

1726
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:36,255
The broth is so thick.

1727
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:39,850
(It tastes even better with meat and kimchi.)

1728
01:03:39,852 --> 01:03:40,925
It tastes great.

1729
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:42,380
Things are going so well.

1730
01:03:42,388 --> 01:03:43,890
(Our team is the best.)

1731
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,965
My heart is warming up.

1732
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,235
Really.

1733
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:51,565
Let's go.

1734
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:53,800
- We have to... - We have to eliminate...

1735
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,100
We have to eliminate the name tag.

1736
01:03:55,101 --> 01:03:56,460
I think we'll succeed.

1737
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,270
We have to go where they're going.

1738
01:03:58,271 --> 01:04:00,945
Call Kwang Soo and ask.

1739
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:03,615
(He's calling Kwang Soo.)

1740
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:05,815
- Hello? - Kwang Soo.

1741
01:04:06,145 --> 01:04:07,885
- Yes? - Why did you call me?

1742
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:09,385
Where are you going?

1743
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:11,655
- Where are we going? - Yes.

1744
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:14,855
We haven't decided yet. We just finished eating.

1745
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:17,365
Where are you going?

1746
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,890
- We should meet... - Yes.

1747
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:21,720
And settle things. Let's meet.

1748
01:04:21,727 --> 01:04:23,830
Where are you going?

1749
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:25,505
Where are you going, Kwang Soo?

1750
01:04:26,165 --> 01:04:28,335
We're going to see the shape of Korean Peninsula.

1751
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:33,545
(In fact, they're going to the oldest building in Jeju Island.)

1752
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:36,640
Not the oldest building in Jeju Island?

1753
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:37,985
(Sharp)

1754
01:04:38,311 --> 01:04:40,385
- What? - The oldest building.

1755
01:04:42,014 --> 01:04:43,715
(Well...)

1756
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,925
Are you sure you're not going there?

1757
01:04:45,952 --> 01:04:47,850
We have to meet once anyway.

1758
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:49,155
Let's meet.

1759
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:53,120
Well... Let's meet.

1760
01:04:53,126 --> 01:04:55,235
(Let's meet.)

1761
01:04:55,795 --> 01:04:57,965
- The way he speaks. - The way you speak.

1762
01:04:58,998 --> 01:05:01,800
- I think we'll meet anyway. - Okay.

1763
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:02,960
Let's do this.

1764
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,670
Let's meet at the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1765
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:07,200
Bring the oldest guy, Seok Jin.

1766
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:09,240
Hey. Who is your target?

1767
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:10,375
(Suddenly)

1768
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,085
What?

1769
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:13,670
- What are you doing? - Who is your target?

1770
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:18,125
All of you would be easy targets for us.

1771
01:05:18,184 --> 01:05:20,110
But we picked the easiest opponent.

1772
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,755
(They picked the easiest opponent.)

1773
01:05:22,722 --> 01:05:24,020
- It must be you. - Is it me?

1774
01:05:24,023 --> 01:05:25,095
(Surprised)

1775
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:27,220
- Is it me? - It must be you.

1776
01:05:27,226 --> 01:05:28,935
Yes, it's you.

1777
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:30,930
- Bingo. - Is it really me?

1778
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,205
Bingo.

1779
01:05:32,331 --> 01:05:33,330
Let's meet first.

1780
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:34,430
(Let's meet.)

1781
01:05:34,433 --> 01:05:36,105
Let's do this.

1782
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:38,545
- Okay. - Gosh.

1783
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:40,870
Gosh, I wonder who their target is.

1784
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:42,875
Gosh, I'm so curious.

1785
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:45,885
It's about time one of them betrayed the others.

1786
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:48,055
If someone tells us who their target is...

1787
01:05:48,414 --> 01:05:50,415
Should we promise that we'll spare that person?

1788
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:51,910
(They approach Seok Jin.)

1789
01:05:51,918 --> 01:05:53,385
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1790
01:05:53,419 --> 01:05:54,950
Just listen.

1791
01:05:54,954 --> 01:05:57,565
(He turns off the speaker.)

1792
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:59,195
- Okay. - Seok Jin.

1793
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:02,420
- Isn't it on speaker? - I turned it off.

1794
01:06:02,428 --> 01:06:04,605
- Just listen. - Okay.

1795
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,765
- If you... - Yes?

1796
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,360
Text me who your target is,

1797
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:11,770
we'll spare you...

1798
01:06:11,771 --> 01:06:13,470
if we win.

1799
01:06:13,472 --> 01:06:15,900
It's a promise.

1800
01:06:15,908 --> 01:06:18,585
Okay? Text me the name.

1801
01:06:18,611 --> 01:06:19,715
Okay.

1802
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,515
Why would you say that while we're shooting?

1803
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:24,725
You could have texted me.

1804
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,195
What did he say?

1805
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:30,220
- What? - What did he say?

1806
01:06:30,223 --> 01:06:32,965
He said they weren't shooting. He talked about something else.

1807
01:06:33,292 --> 01:06:35,390
Seok Jin. What are you doing right now?

1808
01:06:35,394 --> 01:06:36,760
Gosh.

1809
01:06:36,762 --> 01:06:39,160
I'm getting irritated.

1810
01:06:39,165 --> 01:06:41,405
- What's with you? - He talked about something else.

1811
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,200
- Let's ignore Seok Jin from now on. - Gosh.

1812
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:45,800
Gosh.

1813
01:06:45,805 --> 01:06:47,870
I don't know anymore.

1814
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:50,575
Just know that you're already at a disadvantage.

1815
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:54,285
- Have you heard from Seok Jin yet? - No.

1816
01:06:54,747 --> 01:06:56,855
I think he's thinking.

1817
01:06:58,084 --> 01:06:59,455
Why isn't he telling us?

1818
01:06:59,919 --> 01:07:00,950
We're here.

1819
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:02,495
(They arrive at the oldest building in Jeju Island.)

1820
01:07:03,556 --> 01:07:05,165
This must be the oldest...

1821
01:07:06,425 --> 01:07:09,060
This building has been designated as treasure number 322.

1822
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:11,830
Built in 1448, it's the oldest building in Jeju Island.

1823
01:07:11,831 --> 01:07:13,305
- We're here. - It's called Gwandeogjeong.

1824
01:07:13,332 --> 01:07:14,405
Gwandeogjeong.

1825
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,700
It's right in the center of the city,

1826
01:07:16,702 --> 01:07:19,505
so people often use this place as a meeting point.

1827
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:21,370
- A meeting point. - The next mission is called...

1828
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:23,100
Meet a Celebrity.

1829
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:25,210
(Meet a Celebrity)

1830
01:07:25,211 --> 01:07:27,170
Meet a celebrity who's in Jeju Island right now...

1831
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:28,855
- and take a picture with them. - What?

1832
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:31,080
Meet a celebrity who's in Jeju Island right now...

1833
01:07:31,083 --> 01:07:32,650
- and take a picture with them. - What?

1834
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:35,025
My friend, Jin Ho, is here right now.

1835
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:36,450
Kim Jin Ho from SG Wannabe.

1836
01:07:36,455 --> 01:07:38,290
- Really? - He's in Jeju Island right now.

1837
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:39,590
- He's here? - Yes.

1838
01:07:39,592 --> 01:07:41,260
- I was going to... - Tell him to come.

1839
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,490
I don't know if he's nearby. I wonder where he is.

1840
01:07:43,496 --> 01:07:45,565
- But if we... - Lee Jung.

1841
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:48,530
But if we rip a name tag, we're done.

1842
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:50,375
(We just need to rip a name tag.)

1843
01:07:50,803 --> 01:07:51,870
Right?

1844
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:54,040
(Both teams will get a bingo.)

1845
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,440
(Eliminating the name tag of the target)

1846
01:07:55,441 --> 01:07:57,810
We have to eliminate their name tag.

1847
01:07:57,810 --> 01:08:00,210
- We have to. There's no other way. - I agree.

1848
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:01,980
- We have to guess again. - Of course.

1849
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:03,210
What? It's me.

1850
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:05,250
(What? It's me.)

1851
01:08:05,251 --> 01:08:07,795
It's me. He said it's me.

1852
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,980
- What? - He texted me. It's me.

1853
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:10,990
- Really? - Yes.

1854
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,825
He said it's So Min. Look.

1855
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:14,235
Look.

1856
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,090
- "I'll pick you." - Really?

1857
01:08:16,095 --> 01:08:17,330
"It's So Min." That's what it said.

1858
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:19,890
Really? It's really you?

1859
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:21,175
(What is Seok Jin's strategy?)

1860
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:23,860
I'm going to send it.

1861
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:25,800
- Seok Jin, I... - I'm going to say it's So Min.

1862
01:08:25,805 --> 01:08:27,445
(Watch me.)

1863
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:29,600
(They're going to pretend like they're attacking So Min.)

1864
01:08:29,608 --> 01:08:31,670
Let's run at So Min.

1865
01:08:31,677 --> 01:08:32,970
Jong Kook will try to block us, right?

1866
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:34,315
Let's rip his name tag then.

1867
01:08:35,848 --> 01:08:38,280
- He said it's me. - We can't trust him though.

1868
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,580
Pretend like it's me...

1869
01:08:40,586 --> 01:08:43,180
and protect me.

1870
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:45,665
I'm sorry, but this is my team.

1871
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:48,620
- I'll make the calls. - Fine.

1872
01:08:48,627 --> 01:08:50,320
(Stay out of this.)

1873
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:52,730
- Why are you doing this? - Each person...

1874
01:08:52,732 --> 01:08:54,230
Each person should... Hold on.

1875
01:08:54,233 --> 01:08:56,000
- Don't you know this is my team? - Hold on.

1876
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:57,060
All of a sudden?

1877
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:58,570
- It's not all of a sudden. - Look.

1878
01:08:58,571 --> 01:09:00,300
- This is my team. - Look at this guy.

1879
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:03,200
I formed the foundation for the team and all of a sudden?

1880
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:04,840
I get this team is named after you,

1881
01:09:04,844 --> 01:09:07,685
but you should be satisfied with the team name.

1882
01:09:07,913 --> 01:09:09,415
- Let's get away. - Hey.

1883
01:09:09,715 --> 01:09:12,955
If we have one less person, it's a disadvantage.

1884
01:09:13,252 --> 01:09:14,380
That's right.

1885
01:09:14,387 --> 01:09:15,825
That's the only way for us to win.

1886
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:17,025
See?

1887
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,865
I want my team to win.

1888
01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:20,990
Here.

1889
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,660
(He did something honorable, and he's full of confidence.)

1890
01:09:22,661 --> 01:09:25,865
I'll say it's Jong Kook then.

1891
01:09:26,832 --> 01:09:29,135
It's weird if we don't mention his name.

1892
01:09:29,802 --> 01:09:31,670
That means you're only trying to save yourself.

1893
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,730
How?

1894
01:09:32,738 --> 01:09:34,105
How does it matter?

1895
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:37,610
- How does that matter? - Let's all say it's Jong Kook.

1896
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,170
I'm trying to trick them.

1897
01:09:39,178 --> 01:09:41,080
- It's odd if we don't mention him. - Se Chan.

1898
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,280
We're in this situation, so let's all send it.

1899
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:45,850
You're a weasel.

1900
01:09:45,851 --> 01:09:48,355
You consider me that way? Fine.

1901
01:09:49,622 --> 01:09:50,890
(Look who's accusing me.)

1902
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:52,125
- So Min. - Yes.

1903
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:54,160
What if I get blown away?

1904
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,820
- Hey. - What is wrong with her?

1905
01:09:55,828 --> 01:09:57,665
(Why does she want to get punished?)

1906
01:09:58,531 --> 01:10:00,160
Why are you trying this?

1907
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:01,200
Jong Kook held the club.

1908
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,035
- You have layers on, so it's okay. - Jong Kook.

1909
01:10:03,502 --> 01:10:04,875
- Jong Kook. - Does that hurt?

1910
01:10:05,404 --> 01:10:07,075
(You have layers on so it's okay.)

1911
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,740
- Does that hurt? - Jong Kook.

1912
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:10,600
- Hey, don't do that. - Jae Seok.

1913
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:11,740
- Try it. - Lie down.

1914
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:12,770
- Lie down. - Let me try.

1915
01:10:12,778 --> 01:10:14,185
Lie down for me.

1916
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,510
You hit his lower back.

1917
01:10:19,518 --> 01:10:20,895
- I'm sorry. - You hit his lower back.

1918
01:10:21,454 --> 01:10:23,680
(She hits the wrong spot.)

1919
01:10:23,689 --> 01:10:25,120
You hit his lower back.

1920
01:10:25,124 --> 01:10:26,350
(This is ridiculous.)

1921
01:10:26,358 --> 01:10:27,865
- I'm sorry. - You hit his lower back.

1922
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,195
Was that your butt?

1923
01:10:29,662 --> 01:10:32,130
Why is your butt so low?

1924
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:35,030
(His butt is too low.)

1925
01:10:35,034 --> 01:10:36,630
You hit my tailbone.

1926
01:10:36,635 --> 01:10:38,370
(Team Senior Yu is having fun.)

1927
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,130
- We're here. - I said it's So Min.

1928
01:10:40,139 --> 01:10:42,040
We're here. Is this the oldest building?

1929
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,600
(It's finally time to go head-to-head.)

1930
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,240
- Let's go. - Aren't they here already?

1931
01:10:45,244 --> 01:10:46,445
- Are they here? - There.

1932
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:47,740
- They're here. - No.

1933
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,055
No, they're not here.

1934
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:51,725
- Isn't that Jae Seok? - No, it's not him.

1935
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,025
I thought it was here.

1936
01:10:53,052 --> 01:10:54,380
- They're here. - It's them.

1937
01:10:54,386 --> 01:10:56,120
- It won't work. - We have to block it.

1938
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,695
They're here.

1939
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,850
- What do we do? - Hey.

1940
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:01,860
Jong Kook, go to the back. Hold on.

1941
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:03,665
(Team Junior Jee walks into the tiger's den.)

1942
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:07,465
(Jong Kook hides in the back to make a surprise attack.)

1943
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:09,575
Hide.

1944
01:11:09,869 --> 01:11:13,005
(So Min hides as well because she might be the target.)

1945
01:11:14,206 --> 01:11:16,170
- They're here. - They're inside.

1946
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:17,515
(They're determined.)

1947
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:20,745
(Everybody will think we'll lose.)

1948
01:11:21,046 --> 01:11:24,710
(They're plotting an ending that's against everyone's expectation.)

1949
01:11:24,717 --> 01:11:27,285
(Let's turn this around.)

1950
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:28,795
- Where are they? - Let's go, Se Chan.

1951
01:11:29,021 --> 01:11:30,080
Where are you going?

1952
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:31,395
- Jong Kook. - Hey.

1953
01:11:32,124 --> 01:11:33,365
Jong Kook.

1954
01:11:33,792 --> 01:11:34,920
Come back.

1955
01:11:34,927 --> 01:11:36,160
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan betray them first.)

1956
01:11:36,161 --> 01:11:37,365
Jong Kook.

1957
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,965
- Get away. - Run away, Jong Kook.

1958
01:11:41,033 --> 01:11:43,300
(Get away, Jong Kook.)

1959
01:11:43,302 --> 01:11:45,670
- Get away. - Run away, Jong Kook.

1960
01:11:45,671 --> 01:11:47,105
Why should he run away?

1961
01:11:47,206 --> 01:11:49,445
- Be careful, Jong Kook. - Wait.

1962
01:11:49,608 --> 01:11:50,985
It's Jong Kook.

1963
01:11:51,043 --> 01:11:52,585
Run away, Jong Kook.

1964
01:11:52,611 --> 01:11:55,115
Jong Kook, they set you up.

1965
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:57,080
- What are they doing? - I don't know.

1966
01:11:57,082 --> 01:11:58,080
(They're confused.)

1967
01:11:58,083 --> 01:11:59,380
Get away, Jong Kook.

1968
01:11:59,385 --> 01:12:01,855
(Why are they telling me to get away?)

1969
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:04,550
(Where did he go?)

1970
01:12:04,557 --> 01:12:06,565
- What's going on? - What's all this?

1971
01:12:07,493 --> 01:12:08,860
Come here, Seok Jin.

1972
01:12:08,861 --> 01:12:10,695
(Team Senior Yu is confused about this strategy.)

1973
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,590
- You're going to rip my name tag. - What?

1974
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,030
- You're going to rip mine. - Why would we rip yours?

1975
01:12:15,034 --> 01:12:16,330
It's not you. Why would we rip yours?

1976
01:12:16,335 --> 01:12:18,470
Who is it?

1977
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:20,105
It's not you. Why would we rip yours?

1978
01:12:20,339 --> 01:12:21,515
It's not me.

1979
01:12:22,174 --> 01:12:23,740
(Jong Kook is watching everything.)

1980
01:12:23,742 --> 01:12:26,745
- I swear I'm not lying. - Seok Jin.

1981
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:29,840
(What? They made eye contacts.)

1982
01:12:29,848 --> 01:12:31,580
It's Jong Kook.

1983
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:34,625
(They find Jong Kook alone and unite again.)

1984
01:12:35,321 --> 01:12:37,695
(Why are they coming here?)

1985
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:38,790
He's here.

1986
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:39,950
(Eliminate his name tag.)

1987
01:12:39,959 --> 01:12:41,535
Hey, rip his name tag.

1988
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,095
Rip his name tag.

1989
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:45,360
Seok Jin.

1990
01:12:45,364 --> 01:12:47,530
(This is strange.)

1991
01:12:47,533 --> 01:12:48,775
Is it me?

1992
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:52,030
- Jong Kook. - It might be you.

1993
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:54,230
- No, hold on to So Min. - It's not her.

1994
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,900
(Team Senior Yu is confused by the other team's strategy.)

1995
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,870
- Hold on. Kwang Soo. - There he is.

1996
01:12:57,876 --> 01:13:00,045
(This is our chance.)

1997
01:13:00,112 --> 01:13:01,280
Jong Kook.

1998
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,485
(They get a head start thanks to the unplanned strategy.)

1999
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:09,095
(Team Junior Jee surrounds the opponents with great force.)

2000
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:11,195
- Jong Kook. - No, hold on to So Min.

2001
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:13,195
- It's not me? - It's not you.

2002
01:13:13,759 --> 01:13:15,735
- Hold on. - Be careful.

2003
01:13:16,862 --> 01:13:19,960
(Team Senior Yu protects So Min, )

2004
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:23,735
(and Jong Kook is all alone.)

2005
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:28,840
(If they all attack Jong Kook, they can turn this around.)

2006
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:31,410
Let's run at So Min. Jong Kook will try to block us, right?

2007
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,670
Let's rip his name tag then.

2008
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:35,285
- I'll do it. - Wait.

2009
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:37,380
I'll do it.

2010
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:38,580
(Seok Jin steps up as the team leader.)

2011
01:13:38,584 --> 01:13:40,080
- You're going to rip mine. - Why would we rip yours?

2012
01:13:40,085 --> 01:13:43,555
(If he's not the target, he won't be eliminated.)

2013
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:46,850
(Seok Jin steps up and distracts them.)

2014
01:13:46,859 --> 01:13:47,990
Don't come.

2015
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:49,395
- Go. Let's go. - Don't come.

2016
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:51,660
(Seok Jin gets in between Jong Kook and Haha.)

2017
01:13:51,664 --> 01:13:53,965
(This is their chance.)

2018
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:56,760
- Don't come. - We told you.

2019
01:13:56,769 --> 01:13:58,105
Go. Let's go.

2020
01:13:58,837 --> 01:14:01,615
(Will Seok Jin's plan succeed?)

2021
01:14:03,742 --> 01:14:05,110
(What?)

2022
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:06,470
(Ripping)

2023
01:14:06,478 --> 01:14:08,280
- Go. Let's go. - Don't come.

2024
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,340
(What?)

2025
01:14:09,348 --> 01:14:11,625
(What's going on?)

2026
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:13,310
(What happened?)

2027
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:14,595
What just happened?

2028
01:14:14,953 --> 01:14:16,420
(Why did Seok Jin get eliminated?)

2029
01:14:16,422 --> 01:14:18,895
(That means...)

2030
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,590
(This morning, they were choosing the target.)

2031
01:14:21,593 --> 01:14:23,920
(Team Senior Yu's target was Seok Jin.)

2032
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:25,235
This is interesting.

2033
01:14:25,831 --> 01:14:26,960
(It was me?)

2034
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,205
What were you doing?

2035
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:31,275
- That's not how you do this. - Why did you do that?

2036
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,230
This is so not fun. What was that?

2037
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:34,815
This isn't fun at all.

2038
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:37,275
- What are you doing? - What did you do?

2039
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:39,210
What just happened?

2040
01:14:39,211 --> 01:14:40,770
Why did he come?

2041
01:14:40,779 --> 01:14:42,440
- Why did you do that? - Why did you do that for?

2042
01:14:42,448 --> 01:14:44,210
Did you overestimate yourself? Why did you do that?

2043
01:14:44,216 --> 01:14:45,825
I thought it wasn't me.

2044
01:14:46,151 --> 01:14:48,380
- I didn't think it was me at all. - Why not?

2045
01:14:48,387 --> 01:14:50,280
I just thought it wasn't me.

2046
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:53,325
Why did he hit the empty can last week?

2047
01:14:53,859 --> 01:14:55,835
Why do you keep ruining the plan?

2048
01:14:56,962 --> 01:14:58,160
Then,

2049
01:14:58,163 --> 01:14:59,605
should we give you a chance?

2050
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:01,700
(They lost, but this is not the end.)

2051
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,830
(They can switch one team member.)

2052
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:05,945
The winning team can save one person from the losing team.

2053
01:15:06,505 --> 01:15:08,370
- Then, should we give you a chance? - Yes.

2054
01:15:08,373 --> 01:15:10,315
Let's go to the torturing equipment.

2055
01:15:10,843 --> 01:15:12,110
Let's go to the torturing equipment.

2056
01:15:12,111 --> 01:15:13,815
(Dashing)

2057
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:15,410
(This is their last chance to avoid sleeping at the ice rink.)

2058
01:15:15,414 --> 01:15:18,225
We'll time you from now on.

2059
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:21,280
(I'll twist his legs.)

2060
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:23,780
- You can take turns. - I'll do one person at a time.

2061
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:25,290
- You can take turns. - It's one person at a time.

2062
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,650
We knew this would happen,

2063
01:15:26,658 --> 01:15:29,420
so we prepared for this.

2064
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:31,235
- Let's time this. - Okay.

2065
01:15:31,463 --> 01:15:32,960
It's how long you can resist, right?

2066
01:15:32,965 --> 01:15:34,330
- Cross your legs. - Okay.

2067
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,900
- Like this? I'll resist. - Yes.

2068
01:15:35,901 --> 01:15:37,360
You can't ask for a time out.

2069
01:15:37,369 --> 01:15:39,075
Get set, go.

2070
01:15:39,505 --> 01:15:40,775
(Groaning)

2071
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,475
(He's done.)

2072
01:15:43,842 --> 01:15:45,040
It's over.

2073
01:15:45,043 --> 01:15:46,545
(He feels the electricity.)

2074
01:15:46,612 --> 01:15:47,855
Two seconds.

2075
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,555
That was two seconds. That was long.

2076
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:52,785
I'm in first place right now.

2077
01:15:53,585 --> 01:15:55,820
This will take forever,

2078
01:15:55,821 --> 01:15:57,865
so let's go to a different one.

2079
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:01,160
Should we move on?

2080
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,460
Let's see how many hits they can take.

2081
01:16:03,462 --> 01:16:04,730
In a row? Okay.

2082
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,830
(He clenches his teeth.)

2083
01:16:05,831 --> 01:16:07,035
I'm ready.

2084
01:16:08,901 --> 01:16:10,335
- Would you be okay? - Yes.

2085
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:11,575
Here's one.

2086
01:16:15,174 --> 01:16:17,675
(Shaking)

2087
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:20,910
- He lasted. - He did.

2088
01:16:20,913 --> 01:16:22,340
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

2089
01:16:22,347 --> 01:16:24,650
- Here's two. - He's resisting.

2090
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,955
- Yes. - Here's two.

2091
01:16:31,623 --> 01:16:33,925
(It's painful.)

2092
01:16:34,426 --> 01:16:36,865
Wait. What's wrong? Why are you sitting?

2093
01:16:36,929 --> 01:16:38,530
Jae Seok.

2094
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,465
- What? - You're so funny.

2095
01:16:40,532 --> 01:16:42,775
Who are you to hit him?

2096
01:16:43,035 --> 01:16:44,570
- Jae Seok, - I mean...

2097
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,570
we're not going to use this to make our decision.

2098
01:16:46,572 --> 01:16:48,775
(We're not going to use this to make our decision.)

2099
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:50,400
- What? - Let's edit this out.

2100
01:16:50,409 --> 01:16:51,440
- Okay. - You're going to edit this out?

2101
01:16:51,443 --> 01:16:53,740
That was too violent.

2102
01:16:53,745 --> 01:17:01,185
We need to decide who will survive and who will sleep at the ice rink.

2103
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:03,450
Let's go to the hotel and finish off.

2104
01:17:03,455 --> 01:17:05,120
He must be disappointed.

2105
01:17:05,123 --> 01:17:06,350
Hold on.

2106
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:07,620
We'll do it too.

2107
01:17:07,626 --> 01:17:08,935
We won't pick the person who doesn't scream.

2108
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,735
- I'm serious. - Let's decide when we get there.

2109
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:13,565
Let's decide when we get there. Don't do it here.

2110
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:14,830
It's you for sure.

2111
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:16,700
(You're sleeping outside.)

2112
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:18,630
- It's you. - Fine.

2113
01:17:18,637 --> 01:17:20,930
- We'll sleep together. - Let's do this.

2114
01:17:20,939 --> 01:17:22,870
Let's do this. This is good.

2115
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:24,400
- We'll sleep together. - Good.

2116
01:17:24,409 --> 01:17:26,710
- Okay. - You'll sleep outside,

2117
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:28,240
and you'll freeze.

2118
01:17:28,247 --> 01:17:29,715
- Good plan. - Good.

2119
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:35,455
(Darkness falls in the outdoor ice rink.)

2120
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:37,995
This is entirely outdoors.

2121
01:17:39,057 --> 01:17:40,850
(There are three small tents on the ice rink.)

2122
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:42,435
It's so small.

2123
01:17:44,129 --> 01:17:45,630
This is just the ground.

2124
01:17:45,631 --> 01:17:46,690
(There are sleeping bags for a comfortable rest.)

2125
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:48,700
I heard it's getting cold tonight.

2126
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,935
It's really cold.

2127
01:17:51,503 --> 01:17:52,930
Team Senior Yu is the winner,

2128
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:55,115
so you'll be sleeping in luxurious suite rooms.

2129
01:17:55,507 --> 01:17:56,500
(The winners will get a comfortable rest...)

2130
01:17:56,508 --> 01:18:00,445
(in the elegant, luxurious suite rooms.)

2131
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,655
(Welcome, Team Senior Yu.)

2132
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:06,910
The losing team...

2133
01:18:06,919 --> 01:18:08,020
- will sleep on the ice rink. - We're sleeping here?

2134
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,180
This isn't good.

2135
01:18:09,187 --> 01:18:10,820
You can't sleep here.

2136
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:11,820
(How are you supposed to sleep here?)

2137
01:18:11,823 --> 01:18:13,490
Before that, there will be a change of fates...

2138
01:18:13,492 --> 01:18:15,360
between the flowery road and the icy road.

2139
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,620
This is important.

2140
01:18:16,628 --> 01:18:17,660
(One person from each team will switch where they sleep.)

2141
01:18:17,663 --> 01:18:18,805
This isn't possible.

2142
01:18:18,997 --> 01:18:21,300
First of all, the winning team...

2143
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,400
will choose one person they'd like to save...

2144
01:18:23,402 --> 01:18:24,705
from the losing team.

2145
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:28,375
(Which lucky person will sleep in the suite room?)

2146
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,900
It's Team Junior Jee,

2147
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:33,070
so Seok Jin has to be there.

2148
01:18:33,078 --> 01:18:35,410
We want Seok Jin to stay here,

2149
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:38,380
and Kwang Soo has no reason to be here.

2150
01:18:38,383 --> 01:18:40,610
- I agree. - We gave you a chance.

2151
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:41,620
(We saw you in Gwandeogjeong Pavilion.)

2152
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,620
- We gave you a chance and you lied. - You lied.

2153
01:18:44,623 --> 01:18:47,250
You two can choose A, B, or C.

2154
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:48,290
- I want the middle. - I want B.

2155
01:18:48,293 --> 01:18:49,865
I want the middle.

2156
01:18:50,429 --> 01:18:53,490
Get out. Both of you, get out.

2157
01:18:53,498 --> 01:18:55,735
- It's either one of them. - Let's see who sleeps in C.

2158
01:18:57,703 --> 01:18:59,645
- Feeling! Intuition! Cross! - Feeling! Intuition! Cross!

2159
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:02,445
We'll be in A and B. Come to C.

2160
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:06,240
I was going to...

2161
01:19:06,244 --> 01:19:08,155
exclude Ji Hyo.

2162
01:19:08,413 --> 01:19:09,780
(She almost didn't get saved, )

2163
01:19:09,781 --> 01:19:12,155
(but what made Jae Seok change his mind?)

2164
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:15,620
(On their way to Gwandeogjeong Pavilion)

2165
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:19,420
(Their destination was being kept a secret to avoid the other team.)

2166
01:19:19,424 --> 01:19:22,360
(Jong Kook guessed right.)

2167
01:19:22,361 --> 01:19:23,990
Are you going to the oldest building in Jeju Island?

2168
01:19:23,996 --> 01:19:27,465
(How did Jong Kook guess right?)

2169
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,275
Ji Hyo said...

2170
01:19:31,169 --> 01:19:33,330
they're going to the oldest building.

2171
01:19:33,338 --> 01:19:34,645
(Come to the oldest building.)

2172
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:39,645
(Ji Hyo was the one who provided the information.)

2173
01:19:39,911 --> 01:19:41,980
Come here, Ji Hyo.

2174
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,040
You can sleep in the hotel.

2175
01:19:43,048 --> 01:19:44,825
(She betrayed her team, so she gets to sleep in the suite room.)

2176
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:46,950
- Let's decide. - Yes.

2177
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:48,620
We have to decide.

2178
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:51,180
- Everybody, let's do this. - What?

2179
01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:54,935
The five of you can go to your hotel rooms,

2180
01:19:55,494 --> 01:19:57,960
- and you'll get a call. - They'll call us? That's cruel.

2181
01:19:57,963 --> 01:19:59,090
Should we go then?

2182
01:19:59,097 --> 01:20:00,190
(The person to get the call will come back down.)

2183
01:20:00,198 --> 01:20:01,700
- You know, I... - This is cruel.

2184
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,375
Jae Seok is getting a call.

2185
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:05,845
You got a call from Kwang Soo.

2186
01:20:06,538 --> 01:20:08,440
- Hello? - Come to C.

2187
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,440
(The decision has been made.)

2188
01:20:09,441 --> 01:20:11,540
- We haven't started. - What?

2189
01:20:11,543 --> 01:20:13,240
- It's not yet? - We haven't started yet.

2190
01:20:13,245 --> 01:20:14,880
- We didn't start. - It's not yet.

2191
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,015
(They know who it is even before they start.)

2192
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:19,785
This is nerve-wracking.

2193
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:22,550
This is nerve-wracking. I really don't want to go.

2194
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:23,550
(Please don't let it be me.)

2195
01:20:23,555 --> 01:20:25,790
Think about it. We won,

2196
01:20:25,791 --> 01:20:28,935
so why does it feel like we lost?

2197
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:33,305
What? Why am I getting a call?

2198
01:20:33,532 --> 01:20:35,400
(She gets a call from Seok Jin.)

2199
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,535
Yes, Seok Jin.

2200
01:20:36,802 --> 01:20:37,935
Magnet human.

2201
01:20:39,471 --> 01:20:40,745
(He's worried.)

2202
01:20:41,173 --> 01:20:43,440
(Pausing)

2203
01:20:43,442 --> 01:20:45,185
I'm sorry for calling you.

2204
01:20:47,379 --> 01:20:48,785
Can you give the phone to Jong Kook?

2205
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:50,485
Hold on.

2206
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:52,625
Me?

2207
01:20:54,286 --> 01:20:56,820
(That's right. Jong Kook was rude to Seok Jin.)

2208
01:20:56,822 --> 01:20:58,620
Yes. Hello?

2209
01:20:58,623 --> 01:20:59,920
(Yes. Hello?)

2210
01:20:59,925 --> 01:21:00,995
Yes.

2211
01:21:01,093 --> 01:21:02,220
Jong Kook.

2212
01:21:02,227 --> 01:21:04,460
- Yes. - I haven't heard that tone.

2213
01:21:04,463 --> 01:21:06,065
Can you keep being polite?

2214
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:07,890
- Seok Jin. - Yes.

2215
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:10,135
I only did that because this is TV.

2216
01:21:11,069 --> 01:21:13,500
- Jong Kook. - Yes, Kwang Soo.

2217
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:14,630
(He's so warm.)

2218
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,515
We'll talk casually to you then.

2219
01:21:17,409 --> 01:21:18,815
Sure, go ahead.

2220
01:21:18,977 --> 01:21:19,970
(This is a different situation.)

2221
01:21:19,978 --> 01:21:21,115
You can talk casually.

2222
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,280
Jong Kook.

2223
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,780
- You have to be polite. - You can't do that.

2224
01:21:23,782 --> 01:21:25,880
Really? I'm sorry.

2225
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:27,780
That was Se Chan.

2226
01:21:27,786 --> 01:21:29,080
- I'm sorry. - He called you by your name.

2227
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:30,255
I'm sorry.

2228
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:31,990
(I'm speechless.)

2229
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,565
Was that Se Chan?

2230
01:21:36,828 --> 01:21:37,895
I'm sorry.

2231
01:21:37,996 --> 01:21:40,390
I shouldn't have done that.

2232
01:21:40,398 --> 01:21:41,460
(You have to respect him still.)

2233
01:21:41,466 --> 01:21:43,275
We took a vote, and it was a unanimous decision.

2234
01:21:44,202 --> 01:21:46,270
(They got a unanimous vote for the person sleeping on the rink?)

2235
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:48,375
We took a vote, and it was a unanimous decision.

2236
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:50,615
He got voted.

2237
01:21:52,277 --> 01:21:53,345
(Somebody got voted.)

2238
01:21:56,448 --> 01:21:57,955
Should I pass it on?

2239
01:21:58,450 --> 01:22:01,450
(If it's not Jong Kook, is it 1 of the other 3?)

2240
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:02,625
Yes.

2241
01:22:03,488 --> 01:22:04,555
Okay.

2242
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,625
I'll pass it on. Hold on.

2243
01:22:06,858 --> 01:22:09,195
(He's uneasy.)

2244
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:14,830
What?

2245
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,200
(Is it really me?)

2246
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:17,275
What?

2247
01:22:17,502 --> 01:22:18,570
Go.

2248
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,970
- Hold on. - Sorry.

2249
01:22:19,971 --> 01:22:21,030
(Do I get to stay?)

2250
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:22,515
I got a special order.

2251
01:22:22,807 --> 01:22:24,540
Where?

2252
01:22:24,543 --> 01:22:26,910
- Really? - I got a special order.

2253
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:28,880
I'm sorry.

2254
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,910
- Really? - Yes.

2255
01:22:29,915 --> 01:22:32,150
- What? Am I safe? - Really?

2256
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:33,285
Jae Seok.

2257
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,120
Follow me.

2258
01:22:36,121 --> 01:22:37,320
Jong Kook.

2259
01:22:37,322 --> 01:22:38,320
(Jong Kook, please say it's not me.)

2260
01:22:38,323 --> 01:22:40,565
- What? - Jong Kook.

2261
01:22:40,759 --> 01:22:43,320
(Come here, So Min.)

2262
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,435
What?

2263
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:45,735
Jong Kook.

2264
01:22:46,031 --> 01:22:48,900
(Haha is left alone, and he's dazed.)

2265
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,460
Hold on.

2266
01:22:50,468 --> 01:22:52,545
- I'll take this. - He's getting a call.

2267
01:22:54,372 --> 01:22:57,115
He's getting a call, so let's leave.

2268
01:22:57,242 --> 01:22:59,685
I didn't know I'd be saved.

2269
01:22:59,778 --> 01:23:00,770
Hello?

Where are you?

2272
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:05,985
I got left alone.

2273
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:09,525
Haha, why aren't you coming down?

01:23:11,756 --> 01:23:13,950

(They discussed about allocating tent C.)

2282
01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:30,245
(Haha caused the discord in their team.)

2283
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:34,345
(They all agree to invite Haha who caused the discord.)

2284

Let's get going.

2285
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:38,055
(No, the ice rink.)

2286
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:42,595
This feels like a dream. It feels like I'm dreaming.

My gosh.

2290
01:23:50,028 --> 01:23:53,165
This is too cozy.

2291
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,200
Is this the outside?

2292
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:59,145
- Hurry up. Go in. - Haha.

2293
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:02,940
- It's shaking in the wind. - How do we...

2294
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:04,415
This is insane.

Everybody, good night.

2296

We'll go now.

2297
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,215
I'm so mad!

- Everybody, - In the morning...

Sleep tight.

Good night.
