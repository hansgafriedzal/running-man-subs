00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:11,855
(Paju, Gyeonggi Province)

2
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:16,355
(Where is everyone? The field is empty.)

3
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:21,260
(Where are the members? Why is Kim Yoon Sang there by himself?)

4
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:22,890
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,265
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

6
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:26,360
(Why are they playing rock-paper-scissors?)

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,830
- Rock-paper-scissors - Okay.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,360
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,700
- No! - I'm last.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,330
You're 1st and 2nd. I'm 3rd.

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,630
- Okay. - 4th and 5th.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,845
- Okay. - Let's do this.

13
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:38,970
(Why is she trying to look cute all of a sudden?)

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,810
- Wait, hold on. - No, don't do that.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,570
- That wasn't it. - Why did you do that?

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,940
I'm rushing.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,180
(We'll reveal why the ladies are filming a clip.)

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,685
Make a storyboard and a clip that represents your team.

19
00:00:51,065 --> 00:00:52,395
All right.

20
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,220
Okay. We're starting, Jae Seok.

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,690
(It looks like they're preparing to do something.)

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,895
Cue.

23
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,930
(It's time, Jae Seok.)

24
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,005
(Can I just walk over there?)

25
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:04,130
(They're filming under Haha's command since he's most tech-savvy.)

26
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,000
- Great. It's my turn now. - You should give it a try too.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,205
- It's my turn. - Okay.

28
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,905
- You can just press it. - Okay. Get ready.

29
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,545
Get ready.

30
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:17,720
- I did it. - That's not it, Jae Seok.

31
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:18,940
I did it right.

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,055
(How can you not even do this simple task?)

33
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,850
(Jae Seok feels small when it comes to new technology.)

34
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,620
- Everyone, cup your faces. - 1, 2.

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,825
Hold on.

36
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,565
- Wait. Start. - 1, 2.

37
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:32,995
(He does his best just in case Haha scolds him again.)

38
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,290
We can apply special effects on this.

39
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,705
(Special effects can conceal their looks.)

40
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,430
- This is nice. - My gosh, what is that?

41
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,645
(Team Jae Seok finishes making their clip.)

42
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:51,255
("Oldies Use New Technology: Why Is Sang Yeob with Them?")

43
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:54,510
- We can choose songs from here. - Okay. Let's choose one.

44
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,220
(They are looking for the background music.)

45
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,350
- My goodness. - No, let's not choose that one.

46
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,495
No, let's not do that. Let's not use that song.

47
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:03,150
Come on. Don't use that song.

48
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,795
We can't use my song.

49
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:07,260
(Smiling)

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,490
Jong Kook, this isn't a photo. You need to move in this clip.

51
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,230
- I have to move? - Yes, you have to move.

52
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,300
- I'll move like this. I will. - You will move? Okay.

53
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,945
1, 2, 3, 4.

54
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,440
(Jong Kook is happy that his song is chosen.)

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,870
- Should we jump? - Jump?

56
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,170
- Should we jump a few times then? - Yes.

57
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,045
- Get ready. Start. - Five jumps.

58
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:27,850
(You're lovely from head to toe)

59
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,210
- Okay. - Okay.

60
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,620
- I think we did it. Is that so? - We did it. It worked perfectly.

61
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,695
("He Was Embarrassed to Pick His Song: He's the Happiest")

62
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:40,890
- It doesn't look unnatural. Great. - It's natural

63
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,935
It doesn't look unnatural

64
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:46,160
- We should start with gateball. - All right.

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,700
(Seok Jin and Se Chan are in the third team.)

66
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,440
- We should... - Thanks for this new character.

67
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,800
- Seok Jin, this isn't a bad one. - What?

68
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
This new character isn't bad.

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,570
All right. This is great.

70
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,370
The new generation knows how to work this app.

71
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,155
We're starting, Seok Jin. Get ready.

72
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,785
Start.

73
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,765
(He puts on the performance of his lifetime.)

74
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:09,420
(This looks great!)

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,960
- Why are you so good? - Hey.

76
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,295
It went right in.

77
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:23,815
("Seok Jin, the Promising Player: 1st Talent in 50 Years")

78
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,200
(Amazing! This is perfect!)

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,310
Seok Jin, you did a good job filming this.

80
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:29,715
- It's perfect. - Awesome. This is perfect.

81
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,140
Start.

82
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,355
(Only the ladies remain.)

83
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:37,095
(Unlike previous teams, they look lovely.)

84
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,990
(These five ladies show off their cuteness.)

85
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,625
You should bend your head like this.

86
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:58,015
("They Are Friendly Off-Camera: But Fierce During Missions")

87
00:03:58,415 --> 00:03:59,800
Hey, this is funny.

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,385
(It's been a while since they rediscovered their cute sides.)

89
00:04:02,915 --> 00:04:05,110
(They are completely focused on the clip.)

90
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,585
That was fun.

91
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,580
- That was interesting. - We could see people...

92
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,480
- waiting in the back. - We could see ourselves.

93
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,020
- I didn't know we'd be in it. - Right.

94
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,165
- That was fun. - It was, indeed.

95
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:18,720
Hello, everyone. My name is Kim Yoon Sang. I'm an SBS announcer,

96
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,130
your host for the gala show of Running Man's 36-Strategy Olympics.

97
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:26,600
I heartily welcome you to the show that many national players joined.

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,630
Let me introduce you the players of your heated cheers.

99
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,570
They're an assembly of players with great speed.

100
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,970
However, at the end of their chase,

101
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,185
they've always faced unfortunate endings.

102
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:40,485
This bobsleigh team will run with all their might as always.

103
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,650
(4 players can write history on the ice.)

104
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,795
(Bobsleigh players challenge the limits of mankind.)

105
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,725
(Screaming)

106
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:54,035
(Screaming)

107
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,530
- Get in. Get in now. - Will you get in first?

108
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,660
Get in the front. Take the front.

109
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,900
- Get in the front. - All right.

110
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,105
Sang Yeob, you're next.

111
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,900
(Here we come.)

112
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,315
- Let's go. - Push.

113
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:08,185
Hey.

114
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:11,910
- Hey. - My goodness.

115
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,910
- Move it. - What are we doing?

116
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,780
(The fathers are worried that their kids might watch this.)

117
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,720
Doesn't this make you feel embarrassed?

118
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,350
- This is really embarrassing. - I didn't know about this.

119
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,165
You guys are too mean.

120
00:05:21,595 --> 00:05:23,420
- It's our first meeting. I'm sorry. - By the way,

121
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,520
- Yoon Sang should commentate. - Right.

122
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,330
After introducing us, he's looking at us with pity.

123
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,030
- Can he pretend he doesn't know us? - Unbelievable.

124
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,770
- He's really here to host the show. - My gosh.

125
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,970
- He's like a machine. - He's not approachable at all.

126
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,245
Moving on.

127
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,270
(The machine is speaking his lines.)

128
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,470
- I can't believe him. - Seriously.

129
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,640
- He's unbelievable. - There was a global fad of...

130
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,710
- "Young Mi". - Come out now.

131
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,210
They might not have Ms. Glasses,

132
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,650
but they have the charismatic leader, Ji Hyo.

133
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:53,865
Here's Team Song, the curling team with the best teamwork.

134
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:57,960
(Team Kim caused a sensation in Korea and all around the world.)

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,605
(Team Song will challenge to defeat the mighty Team Kim.)

136
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,900
- Ji Hyo looks like the player. - Ji Hyo does resemble her.

137
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:06,030
Ji Hyo looks like her.

138
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,475
(Ji Hyo is the charismatic leader.)

139
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:11,245
(Ji Hyo is the spitting image of the curling player.)

140
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,970
(Everyone seems busy while trailing behind Ji Hyo.)

141
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,040
Move aside.

142
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
(Whom is she talking to?)

143
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,340
(What are you doing?)

144
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,840
- I'm sorry to interrupt. - She's cutting the grass.

145
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,910
Move away.

146
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,610
- Everyone, gather up. - That's not it.

147
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,780
Hey.

148
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,495
All right, girls.

149
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:28,090
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

150
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,350
Ji Hyo does look like her.

151
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,020
- You do look like her. - I know, right?

152
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,420
- Ms. Glasses. - Ji Hyo does look like her.

153
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,935
(Young Mi! We need to get the Luxury Package!)

154
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:40,330
He's the oldest member among the members of Running Man.

155
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,330
- The oldest member? - He shows the perfect chemistry...

156
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,700
with the youngest member. This gateball team is the friendliest.

157
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,415
- Gateball? - What? Gateball?

158
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:54,150
(You can discover how fun gateball can be in the twilight years.)

159
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,520
(Gateball, the national sport, is the protector of elders' health.)

160
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,725
My gosh.

161
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,095
Seok Jin.

162
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:03,795
Seok Jin, try to get the ball in here.

163
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:05,290
- Seok Jin. - What is this?

164
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,735
(Seok Jin shows up.)

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,660
Seok Jin, get the ball in here.

166
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,660
(Mr. Jee shows up.)

167
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,660
My goodness.

168
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,730
(He's still going strong.)

169
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,975
(Everyone is moved by his powerful gait.)

170
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:18,470
Seok Jin, get the ball in here.

171
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,700
(Seok Jin tries to put on a funny skit.)

172
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,545
Don't try to make it funny. Just do it.

173
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:24,685
Gateball is a good sport for the elders.

174
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:26,910
Gateball is a good sport for the elders.

175
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,785
(It's the miracle of Mr. Jee.)

176
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:31,520
- He did it! - Yes!

177
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,820
I'll live a long life!

178
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,220
- This is amazing. - I will live a long life!

179
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,625
- That was awesome. - I told you he could do it.

180
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:41,735
They proudly represent Korea and are the pride of Asia.

181
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:44,200
They are the mascots of 36-Strategy Olympics.

182
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:46,830
Let me introduce you Soohorang and the human-faced bird.

183
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,030
- Who? - The human-faced bird?

184
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,805
- Soohorang and the bird? - What?

185
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:54,210
(The whole world loved the mascot of Pyeongchang Olympics, Soohorang.)

186
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,415
(The human-faced bird became the symbol of the opening ceremony.)

187
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,710
- It's the tiger. - It's the tiger.

188
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,710
(Soohorang who might be Jong Kook...)

189
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,195
That's Soohorang!

190
00:08:04,665 --> 00:08:05,980
It's the human-faced bird.

191
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,090
(The bird with Kwang Soo's face enters.)

192
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,660
That's the human-faced bird.

193
00:08:08,665 --> 00:08:10,290
- Wait. - That's Soohorang!

194
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,460
(He looks just like the bird.)

195
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,735
That's the human-faced bird.

196
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,790
That's the human-faced bird.

197
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,960
- He does look like the bird. - Why is he the tiger?

198
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,530
- He doesn't need any disguise. - Jong Kook.

199
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,100
- That's Jong Kook. - He didn't put on makeup?

200
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
He looks like the bird even without makeup.

201
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,140
- The human-faced bird... - You don't need the disguise.

202
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,270
He looks just like the bird.

203
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,615
- He's the human-faced bird. - This is how the bird flies.

204
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:30,840
This is how it's done.

205
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,855
(Fly, bird with Kwang Soo's face!)

206
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,890
Why does he always do this?

207
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,855
Why does he always ride on my back?

208
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,190
All right!

209
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,320
(Hey, there's a party going on here!)

210
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,865
- Why does he always do this? - This is great.

211
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,020
(Kwang Soo is the last one to be introduced.)

212
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,990
Kwang Soo doesn't look any different.

213
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,060
- My goodness. - Of course, I do.

214
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,200
It's a good look on you.

215
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,270
- Seriously. - Did you fight in the waiting room?

216
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,345
- Why do you ask? - Why are you standing so far apart?

217
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:58,475
It just happened this way.

218
00:08:58,785 --> 00:09:00,540
The programs they are in compete in the same time slot.

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,910
Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,910
That's not the reason.

221
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,510
- "Mom's Diary" and "Live". - They compete for viewer ratings.

222
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,950
When I went to the gym, "Live" was on TV.

223
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,280
I told my manager...

224
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,995
to change the channel for Son Heung Min's live match.

225
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,750
He sent me a video of that.

226
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,160
I filmed a video and sent it to him right away.

227
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,290
Why did you...

228
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,990
- Why did you do that? - What?

229
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,605
He doesn't watch the program I am in.

230
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,190
I don't know why he does that.

231
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,860
This is frustrating.

232
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,900
- For goodness' sake. - He is an embodiment of revenge.

233
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
I am an embodiment of revenge.

234
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,270
Everyone,

235
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,570
- this isn't the end. - Are more people coming?

236
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,770
- Are more people coming? - Everyone is here.

237
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,985
Are more people coming?

238
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:36,010
- Are more people coming? - Everyone is here.

239
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,140
I will introduce the last team...

240
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,440
that completes...

241
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,980
Running Man's 36-Strategy Olympics.

242
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,110
- Really? - Are there more guests?

243
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,680
The real athletes are here.

244
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,820
They are the Formula One drivers of the ice track.

245
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,520
- Really? - The Avengers on ice...

246
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,250
in the national skeleton team,

247
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,360
- Yun Sung Bin and Kim Ji Soo! - Really?

248
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,605
(Yun Sung Bin and Kim Ji Soo of the national skeleton team?)

249
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:58,135
(Are you serious?)

250
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,505
Really?

251
00:10:00,645 --> 00:10:04,015
(Yun Sung Bin and Kim Ji Soo)

252
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,315
(They are really here.)

253
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,955
Iron Man!

254
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:16,310
(Yun Sung Min is a gold medalist from the Pyeongchang Olympics.)

255
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,750
(Kim Ji Soo is top 6 from the Pyeongchang Olympics.)

256
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:26,635
(Iron Man of ice finally comes to Running Man.)

257
00:10:26,935 --> 00:10:28,390
(They give them a warm welcome.)

258
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,990
Hello.

259
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,775
(He bursts out laughing.)

260
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:38,375
(Kwang Soo's looks make even Iron Man falter.)

261
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:42,040
(Kwang Soo is happy that he made Sung Bin laugh.)

262
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,110
Hello.

263
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,010
(Celebrities are fascinated by these real celebrities.)

264
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,320
They really came. They really came.

265
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:49,525
He even brought his helmet.

266
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,320
(They are all over the place.)

267
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,650
- Where should I go? - Stand here.

268
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,780
Stand in the middle.

269
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,490
- Make yourself comfortable. - Stand in the center.

270
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,690
Do as you please.

271
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,900
The national skeleton team.

272
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:03,500
- The pride of Korea! - Please introduce yourselves.

273
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:07,300
I am a skeleton racer who competed in the Pyeongchang Olympics,

274
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,400
Yun Sung Bin.

275
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,740
(A gold medalist, Yun Sung Bin)

276
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,270
- It's your turn. - I am...

277
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,170
also a skeleton racer. My name is Kim Ji Soo.

278
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,310
(Top 6, Kim Ji Soo)

279
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,640
This is incredible.

280
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,850
- Will they join us for today? - It's an honor.

281
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,980
Yoon Sang, what is going on?

282
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,180
- They will join you for today. - Really?

283
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,850
Sang Yeob told me that Yoon Sang makes a lot of mistakes...

284
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,360
- during sports news. - Really?

285
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,365
- He is very good at soccer. - Really?

286
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,075
He got hit by a ball he kicked.

287
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:41,645
(An actual footage of "SBS News")

288
00:11:43,145 --> 00:11:45,180
(The ball hit his face.)

289
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:47,115
(My goodness.)

290
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:50,070
(He smiled as if it was planned.)

291
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,540
- Did you do it on purpose? - It was like a comedy skit.

292
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,180
He will succeed Shim Hyung Rae in slapstick comedy.

293
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,980
You know,

294
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,680
Producer So Hyun told me...

295
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,020
that she started out on the same year as Yoon Sang.

296
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,620
"Jae Seok, Yoon Sang needs to be popular."

297
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,030
(Jae Seok, Yoon Sang needs to be popular.)

298
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,505
Speak for yourself!

299
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,770
Speak for yourself, So Hyun.

300
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,600
She told me that Yoon Sang needs to be popular.

301
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,030
Running Man needs to be more popular.

302
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,475
"Speak for yourself."

303
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:21,040
You said in an interview...

304
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,550
that you want to visit Running Man.

305
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,780
It's Running Man.

306
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,580
That's why you wanted to visit the show.

307
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,150
It will be funny if he and Jong Kook have a match.

308
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,650
Why would you pit me against an athlete in a national team?

309
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,225
I am a singer.

310
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,360
Don't lie! You are not a singer.

311
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,660
People keep misunderstanding me.

312
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,930
Your occupation changed a long time ago.

313
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,060
- My occupation never changed. - You are an entertainer.

314
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Although I can sing well, people said that...

315
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,905
I have a mosquito's voice.

316
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,745
He is incredible.

317
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:54,910
Sung Bin, you won a gold medal.

318
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,810
I heard that you were affected by it...

319
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,310
for a while afterwards.

320
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,280
I continuously watched a video of the match.

321
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,855
- A video of your match? - Yes.

322
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,250
We do that, too.

323
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,420
- We revisit the good memories. - To be honest,

324
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,150
- we revisit... - Of course, we do.

325
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,390
the good memories.

326
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,730
I didn't do it to relive the touching moment,

327
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,060
but to analyze my techniques.

328
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,560
Watching the video 2 or 3 times is enough...

329
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,770
to analyze your techniques. How many times did you watch it?

330
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,300
No, you have to watch it continuously...

331
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,400
- to catch the minuscule mistakes. - Really?

332
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
He showed it to me and said,

333
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,810
"Don't I look cool?"

334
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,340
(He is lying.)

335
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,840
My goodness.

336
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,510
- That's incredible. - He is just like us.

337
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,495
- He is just like us. - That's right.

338
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:41,360
Watching a video of the match must fill you with pride.

339
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,920
- It wasn't satisfactory. - Really?

340
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,420
Did Sung Bin say that?

341
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,890
No. He said he looked too cool.

342
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,235
(Ji Soo shakes his head.)

343
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:50,365
That's a good attitude.

344
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:53,960
He continues to reflect upon himself.

345
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,670
- Who does he think he is? - Who are you to teach him?

346
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,900
It's not like that.

347
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,770
He fixed Park Ji Sung's form...

348
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,410
and Ryu Hyun Jin's workout routine.

349
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,910
He will do the same for them.

350
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,280
Jong Kook has fixed the forms...

351
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,885
of the world-famous athletes.

352
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:10,380
(Jong Kook's nagging even help win a gold medal twice.)

353
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,520
He has done that.

354
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,355
They are the national treasures.

355
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,190
Sung Bin, when do you begin...

356
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,820
receiving your monthly pension?

357
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,260
- My monthly pension? - That's right.

358
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,495
(Flustered)

359
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:22,965
You don't have to answer that.

360
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,400
(He is very interested in pension.)

361
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,660
Pension?

362
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,870
Seok Jin is cool today.

363
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,530
He is older than the two of them combined.

364
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,940
(He is older than the two of them combined.)

365
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,110
(25 plus 25 is still less than 53.)

366
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,370
He is so cool. I'm very impressed.

367
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,410
Really?

368
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,780
- How old are you? - I am 25 years old.

369
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,840
My goodness.

370
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,755
The 2 of them combined are 3 years younger than me.

371
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:44,120
We will answer your question...

372
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,125
if you tell us when you will begin to receive...

373
00:14:47,165 --> 00:14:48,520
your monthly pension, Seok Jin.

374
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,290
I have 10 years to go.

375
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,790
Take good care of your health.

376
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,890
My understanding is the two of you are friends.

377
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,160
Are they the same age?

378
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,700
You must know each other's strengths and weaknesses.

379
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,000
In your opinion, what is Sung Bin like?

380
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,845
They must be close.

381
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,345
Tell us honestly.

382
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,040
- He is cold-hearted. - Cold-hearted.

383
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,745
He stays focused on his goal.

384
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:12,240
Describing him as cold-hearted before anything...

385
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,380
- makes him sound cold. - Seriously.

386
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,150
Wouldn't "cool-headed" be a better description?

387
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,880
- He is cool-headed. - "Cool-headed" is better.

388
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,050
"When it comes to competitions, he is cool-headed."

389
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,050
- Make sure you say that. - I made a mistake.

390
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,160
It sounds like you said, "This jerk is cold-hearted."

391
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,860
"He is as hard as nails."

392
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,005
Do you have any other questions?

393
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,835
Da Hee.

394
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:34,030
Did you bring that helmet as a prize?

395
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,575
No, I need to wear it.

396
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,375
(I see.)

397
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,670
(Cold-hearted)

398
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,310
- My goodness. - He is cold-hearted!

399
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,215
- He is cold-hearted. - He is too cold-hearted.

400
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,140
- He sticks out. - Da Hee.

401
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,080
- He has likes and dislikes. - He sounded like he hated Da Hee.

402
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,825
- You know... - She usually doesn't flush.

403
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:55,520
(Da Hee is knocked out for the first time in Running Man.)

404
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,490
Did something bad happen to you?

405
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,260
(Kwang Soo slanders him.)

406
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,960
- Maybe he hates Da Hee. - He is realistic.

407
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,530
Other members are beginning...

408
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,075
to attack you.

409
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:08,400
I am sorry.

410
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,530
(I have a warm heart.)

411
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,740
Feel free to ask them questions.

412
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,800
Do you have anything you want to know?

413
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,345
Do you have a girlfriend?

414
00:16:15,555 --> 00:16:17,110
- Han Na. - Han Na doesn't disappoint.

415
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,310
It's perfectly natural to be curious.

416
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,040
- Good job. - Good job.

417
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,110
- Do you have a girlfriend? - Yes, I do.

418
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,380
Ji Soo has a girlfriend.

419
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,520
How about you, Sung Bin?

420
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,180
It looks like Han Na was turned down.

421
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,320
- No, no. - Thank about it.

422
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,465
"Do you have a girlfriend?" "Yes, I do."

423
00:16:30,635 --> 00:16:33,620
It just sounds like it.

424
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,990
You are right.

425
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,160
Maybe he lied about it...

426
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,800
Don't you need to go to the Korean Folk Village?

427
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:40,735
I am sorry. I forgot.

428
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:43,400
- I am sorry. - Look at him.

429
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,540
(Kwang Soo gets lost on his way to an ancestral rite.)

430
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,910
If you could team up with a member as a couple,

431
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,610
- who would you choose? - Choose among female members.

432
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,640
Tell us your opinion.

433
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,115
What is...

434
00:16:54,155 --> 00:16:55,410
Step back.

435
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,485
Gosh, she drives me crazy.

436
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,395
I am curious.

437
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:02,150
(Even Han Na tries to get their attention.)

438
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,520
I would choose...

439
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,860
(What is Sung Bin's answer?)

440
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,530
someone...

441
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:08,635
who can help me with games.

442
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:11,260
- Who do you think will help? - It's Ji Hyo.

443
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,205
I wouldn't know...

444
00:17:13,275 --> 00:17:14,670
- until later. - Okay.

445
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,945
- How about you, Ji Soo? - My choice is...

446
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,670
So Min.

447
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,910
(So Min)

448
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,240
- Why? - Why is she your choice?

449
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,615
She is cute.

450
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:28,150
You have a girlfriend.

451
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,155
Your girlfriend is watching.

452
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:31,720
(She can't hear anything.)

453
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,925
You have a girlfriend.

454
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:36,890
- She will be annoyed. - Seriously.

455
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,820
Why are you stepping forward?

456
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,920
- Why are you stepping forward? - Go back.

457
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,630
Why are you stepping forward?

458
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,730
For goodness' sake.

459
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,000
You know,

460
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
I hate that about So Min.

461
00:17:48,445 --> 00:17:49,800
(Me?)

462
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
- She knows it's her. - She knows.

463
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,540
- "Me?" - For goodness' sake.

464
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,910
Sung Bin, how about you?

465
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,070
He gave his answer.

466
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,510
Wake up, will you?

467
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,620
He will decide after he sees how good everyone is.

468
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,585
It's like "A Moment to Remember".

469
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,355
He didn't give anyone's name.

470
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,820
He didn't give anyone's name.

471
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,250
(The question and answer session ends thanks to Seok Jin.)

472
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:11,760
What are we doing with these guests?

473
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,835
Before we begin the gala show in earnest,

474
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,605
since this is a festival,

475
00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:22,810
the athletes prepared a performance.

476
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:24,470
- The athletes did? - My goodness.

477
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,875
- Who? - The two of them?

478
00:18:26,085 --> 00:18:28,410
Really? The athletes prepared a performance.

479
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,715
For the first performance to open the event.

480
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:33,980
Haha, Kwang Soo,

481
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,410
- What? - Ji Hyo, and Se Chan...

482
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,980
will swing dance.

483
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,220
I don't even remember anymore.

484
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,990
- We learned it forever ago! - We aren't prepared for this.

485
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,695
- This is ridiculous. - They didn't even know about this.

486
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,405
- Swing dance? - Seriously?

487
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:50,490
- Hurry up. - That was so sudden.

488
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,900
I don't remember it at all.

489
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,545
I was a human-faced bird, and now, I have to swing dance?

490
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,430
(It's Running Man's one and only talent.)

491
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,875
- What? - What's going on?

492
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,215
(Excited)

493
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:02,645
(They don't remember how to swing dance.)

494
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:07,640
(However, their bodies...)

495
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,380
(remember.)

496
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,650
You remember it.

497
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,980
They remember.

498
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,925
(Swing dance is science.)

499
00:19:15,795 --> 00:19:17,590
(Their bodies automatically react to swing dance.)

500
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,665
Your bodies remember it.

501
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:23,830
(Including a dancing human-faced bird...)

502
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,275
(and Se Chan)

503
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:29,675
(Even the guests are satisfied.)

504
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:32,240
(They dance with their jaws dropped.)

505
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,710
- Look at Kwang Soo's face. - Look at his face.

506
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,170
It looks terrible.

507
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,385
He looks so scary.

508
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:40,080
- He's smiling. - What is he doing?

509
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,455
What is he doing?

510
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,650
(Panting)

511
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,850
It was a great performance.

512
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,150
It wasn't.

513
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,820
It was a great performance.

514
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,350
- The ending was strange. - All right.

515
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,190
- It's getting more exciting. - What's going on?

516
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,330
- Was that a good performance? - It's Running Man's girl group.

517
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:56,905
- "Girl group"? - Who?

518
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:00,600
(Running Man's girl group?)

519
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,870
So Min, Da Hee, and Han Na are up next.

520
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,400
It's "I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S.

521
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,740
- Aren't you good at dancing? - You're up.

522
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,310
- Who is it? - Let's go.

523
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,640
("I'm Your Girl" cover dance)

524
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,955
Do we start on this side?

525
00:20:14,595 --> 00:20:17,785
(So Min and Da Hee look all right.)

526
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:21,125
- Han Na doesn't know. - She doesn't know the dance.

527
00:20:22,035 --> 00:20:23,550
Pardon? Isn't this it?

528
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,095
- That's right. - Right?

529
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:26,460
What's going on?

530
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,660
- Wait a minute. - Han Na seems to know it.

531
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,690
Wait a minute.

532
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,230
- Isn't it the diamond step? - It's good that she dances.

533
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,405
She seems to know how to dance, but what's wrong with her moves?

534
00:20:34,815 --> 00:20:37,445
- What's wrong with her moves? - She moves like an old woman.

535
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,870
An old woman?

536
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,210
Her moves are strange. Can you start the dance again?

537
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,470
- I don't know exactly. - One more time.

538
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,580
Play the music.

539
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,040
- I should watch her. - Do you know it?

540
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,540
- What? - I'll follow Da Hee.

541
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,125
Come to the center, Han Na.

542
00:20:51,865 --> 00:20:53,955
I can't dance in sync with them.

543
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:55,625
Just dance however you want.

544
00:20:56,765 --> 00:20:58,420
- What is she doing? - What?

545
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,490
Just dance.

546
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,065
Look at So Min.

547
00:21:01,705 --> 00:21:04,435
(It's a culture shock.)

548
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:06,175
Her grooves are strange.

549
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,105
(Dancing)

550
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,470
Doesn't it go like this?

551
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,945
- It looks like... - Right?

552
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:16,370
It looks like Zumba dance.

553
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,715
- That's right. - You have strange grooves.

554
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,880
(You danced like this, Han Na.)

555
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,950
That's exactly it.

556
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,650
- Is that it? - She didn't dance like this.

557
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,350
- Being excited is more important... - I agree.

558
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,850
- than accurate movements. - That's so interesting.

559
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,295
Excitement is more important.

560
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:31,635
(Coming up next)

561
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:35,405
(Trust no one around you.)

562
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:37,930
(Mysterious happenings during peaceful Olympic games)

563
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,000
(The culprit is among us.)

564
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,275
(Today's real mission is revealed soon.)

565
00:21:45,445 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a big match.

566
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,510
(It's a big match of strength.)

567
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:53,285
(Who will be the winner, Sung Bin or Jong Kook?)

568
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,650
Now, the special gala show...

569
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,620
will officially start.

570
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Again?

571
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,695
Here's your first mission.

572
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:04,420
It's Defeat the National Team.

573
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,430
(Defeat the National Team)

574
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:08,700
Defeat Sung Bin and Ji Soo?

575
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:12,040
Each team writes and submits games that they're confident about.

576
00:22:12,045 --> 00:22:14,430
Four of them will be selected.

577
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,400
It'll be a team play.

578
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,670
(Teams will play 4 games.)

579
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,340
Really?

580
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,115
Team Skeleton will submit four games.

581
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:26,450
One of the members in the winning team...

582
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:29,450
will receive Luxury Package Sticker immediately.

583
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,855
- Immediately? - Really?

584
00:22:31,025 --> 00:22:33,755
(Luxury Package will be given immediately?)

585
00:22:33,825 --> 00:22:38,490
(The sticker is everyone's wish. Shuddering Sticker is a nightmare.)

586
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,730
(To win Luxury Package by turning the final roulette,)

587
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,630
(it's important to win as many Luxury Stickers as possible.)

588
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,430
(Will Luxury Stickers be given out now?)

589
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,830
We must win no matter what.

590
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,440
However, if Team Skeleton wins,

591
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,615
they'll win a gold medal.

592
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,910
Among the remaining teams,

593
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,680
a member of the team that has the highest score...

594
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,685
will be given a Luxury Sticker.

595
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:03,710
That sounds nice.

596
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,050
Per team, write the game categories that you're confident about.

597
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,565
Per team?

598
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,420
What should we write?

599
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,865
- Let's write a nonsensical one. - Which one?

600
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:15,930
How about voice mimicry?

601
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,770
- Pardon? - He did voice mimicry today.

602
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:20,600
- Right. - We'll win right away.

603
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
It's something that we can win.

604
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,470
- We must win this. - Right.

605
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,700
- Okay. - Okay.

606
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,545
- It's needless to say. - Okay.

607
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:29,215
What can we play so that we win?

608
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,910
- They wrote theirs immediately. - I'm good at most games.

609
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,340
They didn't have to think.

610
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,025
Let's write this.

611
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:37,425
No, that can't be it.

612
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:39,180
Come on.

613
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,150
- We wouldn't win. - Arm wrestling.

614
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,850
- We can win. - I don't think so.

615
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,490
- You have strong arms. - They're from the national team.

616
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,890
- Just this once. - Sung Bin...

617
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,365
Sung Bin has huge arms.

618
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:48,730
- His arms are huge. - Do arm wrestling.

619
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,330
(They submit games that they're familiar with.)

620
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,635
(Jee Seok Jin's Game, Human Magnet)

621
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,610
(He looks around carefully.)

622
00:23:56,615 --> 00:24:02,045
(Which game will the national team submit?)

623
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:06,040
You'll play once four games are selected.

624
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,680
I saw a video of Sung Bin.

625
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,610
In the village for athletes,

626
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,355
he did Sargent jumps.

627
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:15,120
- He jumped over 1m. - Did he jump vertically?

628
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,565
Yes.

629
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:20,465
It's very difficult.

630
00:24:20,505 --> 00:24:22,390
Did he jump 1m?

631
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,330
(Sung Bin jumps up over 1m.)

632
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:26,360
- Goodness. - It's a vertical jump.

633
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,460
That's amazing.

634
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,800
Did you submit it?

635
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,305
Pardon?

636
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:31,970
- He did. - We will...

637
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,615
definitely lose.

638
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:35,870
Did they write Thigh Wrestling?

639
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,970
Didn't you do long jumps, Ji Soo?

640
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,410
Yes, I was in long jump.

641
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,380
- Really? - Goodness.

642
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,810
- We have Da Hee. - Da Hee is good at it.

643
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,110
(We have Da Hee.)

644
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,680
Da Hee is good at long jumps.

645
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,165
(She was good at long jumps on Running Man.)

646
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,450
By the way, So Min.

647
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,665
Stop thanking him for selecting you...

648
00:24:52,805 --> 00:24:54,890
during the shoot.

649
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,935
(Stop thanking him during the shoot.)

650
00:24:58,305 --> 00:24:59,830
When did she thank him?

651
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,730
(During break a few minutes ago)

652
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,605
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

653
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:06,140
- It never happened to me. - Why did you?

654
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,670
- What do you mean? - It's my first time...

655
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,715
this has happened to me.

656
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:11,710
- When did she thank him? - She did.

657
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,720
We aren't teamed up in couples.

658
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,410
Ji Soo was looking away.

659
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,150
(It's because it was my first time.)

660
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,790
"Thank you for selecting me."

661
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:22,320
(Ji Soo, thank you for selecting me.)

662
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,525
- Why are you thanking him? - Seriously.

663
00:25:24,865 --> 00:25:27,560
Goodness, So Min. It isn't even funny.

664
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,890
Jae Seok, please select the games.

665
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,560
Shall I? I'll select a game.

666
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,060
- Select well. - Of course.

667
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,070
- What you select is important. - Select well.

668
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,275
- We'll definitely win our game. - Right.

669
00:25:38,345 --> 00:25:40,140
I'll pick one.

670
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,470
- Please. - Let's get it.

671
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,070
(What's the first game?)

672
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,355
(Jae Seok picks High Jump.)

673
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:47,210
(What's this?)

674
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,210
You did write "High Jump".

675
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,250
(Sung Bin wrote High Jump.)

676
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,420
What? Change it.

677
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,590
What do we do?

678
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,190
They're so coldhearted.

679
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,990
Let's play High Jump.

680
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,130
- That's too harsh. - What do we do?

681
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:05,360
One member from each team participates.

682
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,400
While standing still, jump over mats...

683
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
that keep rising.

684
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,070
The team with the highest record wins.

685
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,510
You earn one point.

686
00:26:15,515 --> 00:26:17,740
Pick a representative from each team.

687
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,940
Se Chan will play.

688
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,340
From our team? Okay.

689
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,410
Jong Kook will play.

690
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,625
(Jong Kook plays.)

691
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,585
Sang Yeob will play.

692
00:26:25,595 --> 00:26:27,350
The one who's lightest should play.

693
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,825
- She can't do it. - How about Han Na?

694
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,750
(It's not even close.)

695
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,400
- Da Hee should play. - Try jumping.

696
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:33,800
Da Hee.

697
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:36,290
- Da Hee can do it. - She has long legs.

698
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,660
(She makes it very easily.)

699
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,175
You play, Da Hee.

700
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:44,030
- It's you. You should play. - It requires thigh strength.

701
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,170
Who will play from this team?

702
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:49,310
(Sung Bin represents Team Skeleton.)

703
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,610
- You're so cold-hearted. - You're harsh.

704
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,040
- You're so harsh. - Seriously.

705
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,050
- You're cold-hearted. - That's cruel.

706
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:57,210
Are you trying to win from the start?

707
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,420
It's a game, so we should win.

708
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,580
They're so cold-hearted.

709
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,265
(One representative from each team is selected.)

710
00:27:02,365 --> 00:27:04,590
(Se Chan, Da Hee, Jong Kook,)

711
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,660
(Sang Yeob, and Sung Bin)

712
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,120
Se Chan is up.

713
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,330
Jump on one foot.

714
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,690
Se Chan is good at sports.

715
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,160
- And... - It's not a big deal.

716
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,900
Even I could do it.

717
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,370
- Please be quiet. - Okay.

718
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,940
- I'll concentrate. Be quiet. - He's so serious.

719
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,440
- He said to be quiet. - Be quiet.

720
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,970
Machine sounds may also affect the game,

721
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,280
- so turn off all the cameras. - What?

722
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:29,110
- Will I be shown? - What's wrong?

723
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,550
Where will I be aired?

724
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,850
- Don't you want to focus? - Where will I be aired?

725
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,650
- Really? - Why would you turn them off?

726
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,250
- Come on. - I should be aired.

727
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,565
All right.

728
00:27:37,795 --> 00:27:39,220
Don't make sounds.

729
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,420
Goodness.

730
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,390
It's Se Chan.

731
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,290
- This is... - Se Chan is good.

732
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,560
He's good at sports.

733
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,760
(He lands easily.)

734
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,130
- It's a success. - See?

735
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,375
- That was light. - It's very basic.

736
00:27:50,545 --> 00:27:53,010
- It's light. - You're amazing.

737
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:54,170
What's amazing about that?

738
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,470
- His jump was so light. - Right.

739
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,510
It was stable.

740
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,440
- Da Hee is up next. - Here's Da Hee.

741
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,680
Let's go, Da Hee.

742
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,910
Let's go.

743
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,010
Can you step aside? We're shooting.

744
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,420
(Are you an audience member?)

745
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,920
I'm in the shoot.

746
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,490
- I'm shooting. - You are?

747
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,365
- He is? - I'm in the shoot.

748
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:11,720
(She bursts out laughing.)

749
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,065
What?

750
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:15,665
What? What's wrong?

751
00:28:15,975 --> 00:28:19,075
- She's laughing. - You're making me feel bad.

752
00:28:19,745 --> 00:28:21,360
Why are you laughing at my face? I'm just standing.

753
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,100
Is she crazy? I didn't make any funny faces.

754
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,470
When you were dancing,

755
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,840
this is what she said.

756
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,710
"Kwang Soo is so ugly."

757
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,055
(She thought Kwang Soo was so ugly.)

758
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:34,680
Can you take those off?

759
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,910
He's cold.

760
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,410
- These are warm. - They keep him warm.

761
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,920
They're uncomfortable to look at.

762
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,680
(His hair looks funny.)

763
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,125
Really?

764
00:28:43,365 --> 00:28:46,520
(Human-faced bird is sad as he is uncomfortable to look at.)

765
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,760
We'll catch you if you fall. So don't worry.

766
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,105
- Okay. - Da Hee. 1, 2, 3.

767
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:56,470
(She succeeds easily.)

768
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,170
- Good job! - Nice!

769
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,200
Let's beat them!

770
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,115
(They're pretty good.)

771
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,340
- Jong Kook, give it a try. - This?

772
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,940
- Okay. - It'd be easy for him.

773
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,810
Jong Kook has strong thighs.

774
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,925
(Smooth)

775
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,280
He's Running Man's athlete.

776
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,125
(That's my boy.)

777
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:17,790
He's Running Man's athlete.

778
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,860
He looked a bit pretentious.

779
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,890
What?

780
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,090
- He looked a bit pretentious. - What?

781
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:24,800
He was like this.

782
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,460
I just wanted to be quick.

783
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,430
I wanted to be quick.

784
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,730
- Sang Yeob. - Sang Yeob.

785
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,400
- Sang Yeob. - Take it easy.

786
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,570
Don't be nervous.

787
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,510
I'm a bit worried.

788
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,115
- Sang Yeob is clumsy. - I'm worried.

789
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:42,585
(He succeeds with great power.)

790
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,290
Nice.

791
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:46,680
Good job.

792
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,920
- It was no problem. - It was nothing.

793
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,950
Sung Bin.

794
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,360
(It's the incredible high jumper's turn.)

795
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
You don't even cheer for him.

796
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,595
Let's go!

797
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,865
(Relaxed)

798
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,975
His thighs look heavy.

799
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:01,430
What was that?

800
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,430
(What just happened?)

801
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,505
- Hold on. - He didn't even bend his legs.

802
00:30:06,585 --> 00:30:10,315
(Flying)

803
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,440
- Hold on. - He didn't even bend his legs.

804
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,910
He flew.

805
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,910
He flew, didn't he?

806
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,580
- Seriously... - He didn't bend his legs.

807
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,120
Was it the wind?

808
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,330
Were you making fun of us?

809
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:23,850
I feel humiliated.

810
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,535
- He flew up like Iron Man. - He just flew up.

811
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:28,930
It looked so smooth.

812
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,135
(It looks effortless.)

813
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,660
(It's no big deal.)

814
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,300
Was it the wind?

815
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,230
He flew, right?

816
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:39,500
Five mats will be added.

817
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,240
Five? That's a lot.

818
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,915
Will you be able to do it?

819
00:30:43,285 --> 00:30:44,940
We'll fall this time.

820
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,310
It looks difficult.

821
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,140
It looked so smooth.

822
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,450
Seriously...

823
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,720
They just gave these to me and left.

824
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,420
- Are you a staff? - I don't work here.

825
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,450
(I'm on the show.)

826
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,420
- Is there a memorial service? - What?

827
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,820
(He looks like he is attending a memorial service.)

828
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,460
- What are you talking about? - Are you sure?

829
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,560
I'm a human-faced bird.

830
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,775
(Don't get me wrong. I'm a human-faced bird.)

831
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:08,060
Go.

832
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,930
- You can do this. - From now on...

833
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,100
By the way, why is your makeup so patchy today?

834
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,540
I have a new stylist.

835
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:16,270
It's her first day.

836
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,570
- Someone new came. - But...

837
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,410
are you shooting a war scene?

838
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,810
(Are you shooting a war scene?)

839
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,180
Does it look that bad? Does it look bad?

840
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,125
Is it patchy?

841
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:28,890
- Are you shooting a war scene? - Mind your own business.

842
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,690
- Especially this part. - It's none of your business.

843
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,160
Your lips are blue too.

844
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,720
Your face looks patchy.

845
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,990
- He looks like a student soldier. - I have a new stylist.

846
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,705
Start.

847
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:39,930
It's so high.

848
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,340
It is high.

849
00:31:41,345 --> 00:31:42,730
It is...

850
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:43,730
(It's a lot higher.)

851
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,700
It is a bit less than 1m.

852
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,740
(It's 90cm tall.)

853
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,710
You can do this. You have to.

854
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,870
You have to do this.

855
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:54,280
(You have to do this for Team Gateball.)

856
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,655
I'm nervous.

857
00:31:58,295 --> 00:32:00,120
(Se Chan is nervous.)

858
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,850
(It doesn't look as effortless as last time.)

859
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,890
Amazing.

860
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,135
Se Chan.

861
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,765
Sung Bin seems...

862
00:32:08,775 --> 00:32:11,090
impressed too.

863
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,300
Se Chan looks different.

864
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,330
- I don't think Da Hee can do this. - It'll be too hard.

865
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,300
- Da Hee... - You're a bit nervous, right?

866
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,900
You can do this

867
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,340
- You can do this. - It's so high.

868
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,300
- Be careful. - We'll catch you if you fall.

869
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,710
I'll take my microphone off for a moment.

870
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,880
What are you going to do?

871
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,740
- She took her microphone off. - Her microphone...

872
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,150
(Speak into this.)

873
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,710
Are you fishing?

874
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,580
- I just want to catch... - Are you fishing?

875
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,720
everything Da Hee says.

876
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,665
(Jae Seok becomes a sound director.)

877
00:32:36,695 --> 00:32:38,025
All right.

878
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:39,420
Start.

879
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,590
You're fishing.

880
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,660
(It's 90cm tall.)

881
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,690
- Start. - Let's go.

882
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,405
(The mats are up to her waist. Will she manage?)

883
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,830
(Jumping)

884
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,570
(She slips.)

885
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,940
It must hurt.

886
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,970
She landed on her knees.

887
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,770
- It made a loud noise. - Good job.

888
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,480
- Good job. - Good job.

889
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,185
Da Hee failed. But she did her best.

890
00:33:02,195 --> 00:33:04,380
- It is hard. - It is.

891
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,320
It was too high.

892
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,350
I'm not sure I can do this.

893
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,560
It'd be funny if he failed.

894
00:33:09,565 --> 00:33:11,350
I'm not sure I can do this.

895
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,860
Let me hold the mats.

896
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,330
I did too much leg exercise yesterday.

897
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,860
(After Da Hee's failure, he feels more nervous.)

898
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,090
Gosh.

899
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,300
You can do it.

900
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,900
(Will Jong Kook be able to overcome this pressure?)

901
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,575
His thighs are so big.

902
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,870
(Jong Kook manages 90cm.)

903
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,170
- It looked so smooth. - Amazing.

904
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,085
(Jong Kook is incredible.)

905
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:34,340
- The male members are all good. - It looked very smooth.

906
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,085
He's surprisingly agile.

907
00:33:37,095 --> 00:33:40,780
- Sung Bin. - It'd be very funny if he fails.

908
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,120
(They're pretty good at it.)

909
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,250
- If he fails... - If he flies again...

910
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,860
- He'll fly this time too. - He will.

911
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,690
He hasn't bent his legs once.

912
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,930
Exactly.

913
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,035
It's as if he has wings.

914
00:33:52,175 --> 00:33:54,130
- He doesn't even bend his legs. - Can I start?

915
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,375
Can I start?

916
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,600
What was that?

917
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,145
(He flies again.)

918
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:02,710
- He flew again. - How can he do that?

919
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,870
(How can he fly like that?)

920
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,110
It looked like you were flying.

921
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,480
- Do you have wires attached to you? - What is this?

922
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,810
- There has to be something. - Do you have wires?

923
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,910
Are you hiding something?

924
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,125
(Is there something under your sleeves?)

925
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,420
How can he fly like that?

926
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,365
That's incredible.

927
00:34:16,465 --> 00:34:18,620
(While Jong Kook used his knees,)

928
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,795
(Sung Bin effortlessly flew up.)

929
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,760
It's as if someone pulled him up.

930
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,300
- It looked effortless. - He flew up.

931
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,905
Five more mats will be added.

932
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,045
This won't be easy. We'll fail this time.

933
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,970
- I knew he'd succeed. - We can't do that.

934
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,945
He didn't even bend his legs.

935
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,340
Please put them here.

936
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,540
(The mats are delivered by the human-faced bird again.)

937
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,280
Is it really okay to make the old man work?

938
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,550
(He looks like an old man.)

939
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,280
He's an old man.

940
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,220
- We're sorry. - I'm just 34.

941
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,750
- I'm not old. - He looks old.

942
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,120
We don't need a memorial service.

943
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,520
(You came to the wrong place.)

944
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Can you give me a bowl of yukgaejang?

945
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,760
What are you talking about?

946
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
You're mistaken.

947
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,930
(I'm just a human-faced bird.)

948
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,340
That looks so high.

949
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:02,610
It's up to your belly.

950
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,570
- We can't do that. - Let's try.

951
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,470
- It won't be easy. - It won't be easy for Se Chan.

952
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,675
Let me measure it.

953
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,240
- It's 110cm tall. - 110cm.

954
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,870
(It's 110cm tall.)

955
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,280
Se Chan.

956
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,040
- If you pull it off, - Let's go.

957
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,710
- we'll be so impressed. - You can do this.

958
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,980
- It's 110cm high. - There you go.

959
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,155
If you pull it off, you'll be a hero.

960
00:35:21,195 --> 00:35:22,450
Will he be able to do it?

961
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,250
Even Jong Kook is practicing.

962
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,820
It's impossible.

963
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,160
I won't be able to do it.

964
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,690
Se Chan, you can do this.

965
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,030
- You can do this. - You can do this.

966
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,290
I don't think so.

967
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,130
- You can. - You can.

968
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,460
You can.

969
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,600
Se Chan, you look so sexy right now.

970
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,100
(You look so sexy.)

971
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,875
I mean it.

972
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:44,885
Han Na seems to have a crush on you.

973
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,950
She's been cheering for you the whole time.

974
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:52,450
- That's not true. - Let me hear her cheer for me.

975
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,950
Han Na is strong, and you're weak.

976
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,490
(A new couple)

977
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,365
If you pull it off, run to Han Na.

978
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:03,135
- You can do this! - I can do it.

979
00:36:03,735 --> 00:36:05,505
Let's run to her.

980
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:10,775
(Se Chan is motivated.)

981
00:36:10,945 --> 00:36:14,000
(The height is 110cm.)

982
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,585
(Will Se Chan get to run to Han Na?)

983
00:36:19,725 --> 00:36:21,540
(Fail)

984
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,280
Se Chan.

985
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
Are you okay?

986
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,310
(Embarrassed)

987
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,820
(It didn't work.)

988
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,095
Will he succeed?

989
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:31,720
(Se Chan fails despite the strong motivation.)

990
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,460
- He hit it so hard. - Are you okay?

991
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,300
- Were you trying to be funny? - No.

992
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,260
Han Na says she's embarrassed by you.

993
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,170
(What are you going to do now?)

994
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,830
This is so humiliating.

995
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,440
He hit right into the mats.

996
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:48,840
- I was startled. - It's so high that I got scared.

997
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,970
Exactly.

998
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:53,020
110cm is really high.

999
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:55,380
Jong Kook, do you want me to cheer for you?

1000
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,810
- I'm okay. - Are you sure?

1001
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:57,950
- I don't need it. - Cheer for him.

1002
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,580
- Cheer for him! - I can cheer for you.

1003
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
- I'm really okay. - Jong Kook, you can do this.

1004
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,065
(Affectionate)

1005
00:37:03,535 --> 00:37:05,250
He can't look her in the eye.

1006
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,620
(He is forced to accept it.)

1007
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Here we go.

1008
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,090
(Se Chan failed at 110cm.)

1009
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,530
- You can do this. - Let's go.

1010
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,175
Let me start.

1011
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:17,330
(It looks almost impossible for a non-athlete.)

1012
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:19,200
I've never done this before.

1013
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,615
(Will he pull it off?)

1014
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,880
(He succeeds!)

1015
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,940
Jong Kook!

1016
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,855
(He did it!)

1017
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:34,980
I've never tried it before, so it's hard to know.

1018
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,250
Amazing.

1019
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,920
- I knew it. - Jong Kook...

1020
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,635
His thighs...

1021
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,565
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

1022
00:37:42,735 --> 00:37:44,560
It's Sung Bin's turn now.

1023
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,800
- Okay. - Ji Soo doesn't even...

1024
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,635
cheer for him.

1025
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:51,500
Sung Bin, you can do this.

1026
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,000
- He is so good. - He'll fly again.

1027
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,315
- Fly up. - He'll fly again.

1028
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:58,540
- Look at that. - He flew up.

1029
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,085
(Is this even possible?)

1030
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:03,910
(After looking around,)

1031
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:07,655
(he flies up.)

1032
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:13,120
- He flew up. - Unbelievable.

1033
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,320
What was that?

1034
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,300
He flew again.

1035
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:17,560
It's impossible.

1036
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,460
He's like a cat.

1037
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,760
It looks so effortless.

1038
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,300
- Isn't it so weird? - It is.

1039
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,800
- Someone must be pulling him up. - He stays in the air so long.

1040
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,100
He can jump so high.

1041
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,315
Five more mats will be added.

1042
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:30,610
(Kwang Soo goes to get the mats.)

1043
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,870
Is it really okay to make the old man work?

1044
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,510
- Five more... - The old man...

1045
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,950
The game hasn't even started, but Kwang Soo is already exhausted.

1046
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,010
Five more.

1047
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,580
- He's exhausted. - I'm not.

1048
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,490
This is impossible. It's up to my chest.

1049
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,220
- It's not going to work. - No.

1050
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,320
- Let me measure it. - Shouldn't we add about three more?

1051
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,790
- Hey, this is... - This is it.

1052
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,430
- It's about this high. - This is amazing.

1053
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,575
- Let's push them slightly. - My gosh, this is incredible.

1054
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:55,060
It's 120cm.

1055
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,130
(The height will be 120cm this time.)

1056
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,470
120cm.

1057
00:38:58,475 --> 00:39:00,500
It was 110cm before. These added 10 more?

1058
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,740
- This is impossible. - So tell me.

1059
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,670
- How could we do this? - It's impossible.

1060
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,770
- All right. - Sang Yeob.

1061
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,320
- Me? - Sang Yeob will start first.

1062
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:07,640
My gosh, this is...

1063
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,780
(How can I do this?)

1064
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,110
Sang Yeob, if you succeed,

1065
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,185
- you should shoot action movies. - We'll start now.

1066
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,655
I think I can do this.

1067
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,320
- Start. - Really?

1068
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,350
I think you can do this too.

1069
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,920
- He's getting better. - It'd look so cool.

1070
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,690
- Our show can unravel... - Hidden talent.

1071
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,790
- potential talents of yours. - That's right.

1072
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:26,200
- You wouldn't do this at home. - Never.

1073
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,760
- You'd only do it here. - Only on Running Man.

1074
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,070
- You can only find those mats here. - You bet.

1075
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,045
Besides, who would bring these mats to your home?

1076
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:34,100
I can bring them to you.

1077
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,270
(I can bring these mats to you.)

1078
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,870
- Anytime and anywhere. - Kwang Soo.

1079
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,955
- Bring them in packs of five. - You got it.

1080
00:39:41,055 --> 00:39:42,925
- I'll start. - Sang Yeob.

1081
00:39:43,195 --> 00:39:44,655
Be confident.

1082
00:39:46,265 --> 00:39:47,780
- He's serious. - Do it.

1083
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,065
You can do this.

1084
00:39:49,295 --> 00:39:50,490
Take a deep breath.

1085
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,720
(He will challenge himself to the extreme height of 120cm.)

1086
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,235
I'll go now. One...

1087
00:39:56,675 --> 00:39:58,335
I made it to the top.

1088
00:39:58,505 --> 00:40:03,275
(His feet got caught in the mats.)

1089
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:05,470
- I made it to the top. - That was so close.

1090
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,240
- I made it to the top. - It was so close.

1091
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,610
You failed, but you were very close.

1092
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,585
- His ankle got in the way. - I was on top of the mats.

1093
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:15,680
(Only two contestants remain for the challenge.)

1094
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,880
- It was so close. - It's Jong Kook's turn.

1095
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,750
- But that was an accomplishment. - It's 120cm high.

1096
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,590
- It goes up to someone's shoulder. - Or someone's chest.

1097
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,020
Look. It's as high as my shoulders.

1098
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,920
It'd be as high as Jin Young's shoulders.

1099
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,205
Right?

1100
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:30,960
- Good luck. - Jong Kook.

1101
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,130
- If he succeeds, it'd be amazing. - Exactly.

1102
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,700
- This is quite a challenge. - His thighs...

1103
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,245
- I'll start now. - Okay.

1104
00:40:36,315 --> 00:40:37,845
You can do this, Jong Kook.

1105
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,615
I'll get the mats again.

1106
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:43,485
(He seems hesitant to jump.)

1107
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:49,255
(After taking a few deep breaths, he jumps at last.)

1108
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:53,295
(Even Sang Yeob, who was confident, failed to jump over this height.)

1109
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:56,065
(The height made Sung Bin shake his head in disbelief.)

1110
00:40:57,035 --> 00:41:02,295
(Will Jong Kook be able to jump on top of the mats?)

1111
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:08,175
(His feet could only touch the mats.)

1112
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,900
- Jong Kook, you were so close. - What a bummer.

1113
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,870
- I couldn't. I couldn't do it. - Try it one more time.

1114
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,510
(As Jong Kook fails, Sung Bin feels relieved.)

1115
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,955
I couldn't bend my thighs.

1116
00:41:20,055 --> 00:41:23,010
- That was so close. - That was really close.

1117
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,310
- Give him 1 more chance. - 1 more chance.

1118
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,820
- If you let him try it again... - Give him one more chance.

1119
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,490
- No, we cannot. - The mats moved.

1120
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,720
- The mats moved. - That was close.

1121
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,220
- But he could get his feet on top. - My gosh, he did.

1122
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,160
- He got his feet on top at least. - It was so close.

1123
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,190
- It's Sung Bin's turn. - My gosh, he could do this.

1124
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,630
(If Sung Bin succeeds, Team Skeleton will win.)

1125
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,930
- He's shaking his head again. - Right now...

1126
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,400
- He's good at acting. - Why are you sighing?

1127
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,130
- Don't act like you're in trouble. - I know you'll do well.

1128
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,300
- But Sung Bin might fail too. - That's right.

1129
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,700
- He might not succeed. - Can I move back a bit?

1130
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,270
- Han Na... - I'm sorry, but that'd be cheating.

1131
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,210
(I'm sorry, but that'd be cheating.)

1132
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,710
- He can't move back, can he? - Yes, he can.

1133
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,310
- No, listen. - He can do that.

1134
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,780
- Then I would've moved back too. - He can move back.

1135
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,220
- I thought that wasn't allowed. - Of course, it's allowed.

1136
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,520
- It's allowed. It's acceptable. - Then let me move back and do it.

1137
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,650
It's acceptable.

1138
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,135
(Sung Bin will try it after overcoming many distractions.)

1139
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:13,900
(He flies up again!)

1140
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,800
- This was hard for him. - Yes, it was hard.

1141
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,330
- This one was hard for him. - It was difficult for him.

1142
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,375
(Without any warm-up exercises, he jumps up 120cm.)

1143
00:42:19,485 --> 00:42:22,170
(No way. He jumped up that high?)

1144
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,510
(It was a bit challenging, but Sung Bin takes the victory.)

1145
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,880
Let's see how high he can jump.

1146
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,210
- Let's add 5 more mats. - Add 5 more.

1147
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,050
- He can do that? - Right now, it's 120cm.

1148
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,820
- He'll try 130cm - You think he can do that?

1149
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,860
I'm in awe now.

1150
00:42:33,865 --> 00:42:36,450
(1m 30cm will be hard though.)

1151
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,420
It comes up as high as my chest now.

1152
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,835
If he succeeds, he's superhuman.

1153
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:42,790
- It's 130cm. - It's too high.

1154
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,790
- Is it higher than your shoulders? - Yes, it is.

1155
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,570
- It's higher than her shoulders. - I can only see her face.

1156
00:42:46,575 --> 00:42:47,900
So he's trying to jump this high?

1157
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,070
It's higher than Jae Seok's nipples.

1158
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:53,400
(It's higher than Jae Seok's nipples.)

1159
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,940
- I must explain thoroughly. - Mats are much higher.

1160
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,650
- Mats are much higher. - They are much higher.

1161
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:00,755
The mats are this much higher than Jae Seok's nipples.

1162
00:43:00,825 --> 00:43:02,180
- That much? - Yes.

1163
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,310
Hey, listen.

1164
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:05,785
Our show airs on a weekend night. How could you say that word?

1165
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:07,320
- I apologize. - I'm sorry.

1166
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,980
(I apologize for the inappropriate word use.)

1167
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,520
- I'm sorry. - You must refer to them indirectly.

1168
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,020
- Use "nubbin" instead. - I'm sorry.

1169
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,360
(This is a mess.)

1170
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,835
What? "Nubbin"?

1171
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:18,635
(That was the refined term.)

1172
00:43:18,775 --> 00:43:20,260
Seriously.

1173
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,300
- Sung Bin... - It's an honor to see this.

1174
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,070
- This really is an honor. - I'm mesmerized.

1175
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,400
- This is incredible. - You've never done this, right?

1176
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,275
- Have you tried jumping this high? - I'm not sure.

1177
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,840
- It's 130cm. - I think he can succeed.

1178
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,815
- He can do this? - But this is too high.

1179
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:33,680
- He can pull this off. He can. - He didn't have to frown so far.

1180
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,540
- Tell me if he's about to fall. - We'll catch you.

1181
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,950
"Falling". Give me a sign.

1182
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,590
- Shouldn't we say, "Catch"? - Don't fall.

1183
00:43:38,595 --> 00:43:40,950
(The overwhelming height makes a gold medalist nervous.)

1184
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,080
All right. Be quiet now.

1185
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,490
The staff must be quiet too.

1186
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:48,490
(If he succeeds this time, he will break the record.)

1187
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:49,530
(Chirping)

1188
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,165
- Birds, be quiet. - "Birds, be quiet."

1189
00:43:52,175 --> 00:43:54,905
(We came here to root for him.)

1190
00:43:55,005 --> 00:43:56,745
Be quiet, you stupid birds!

1191
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,800
- He did it? - Hey, you.

1192
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,115
Be quiet, you stupid birds!

1193
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:02,000
(He flies like a bird...)

1194
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,945
(and successfully jumps over 130cm.)

1195
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:06,815
(I missed it.)

1196
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:08,380
It was the birds.

1197
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
- I missed it because of you! - You.

1198
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,850
(Kwang Soo's yelling was more disruptive than the chirping.)

1199
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,755
- How dare you curse? - I missed it.

1200
00:44:16,095 --> 00:44:17,850
Let's give it up for him.

1201
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,320
(Sung Bin sets the record of 130cm and takes the win.)

1202
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,635
- Good job. - Let's give it up for him.

1203
00:44:23,675 --> 00:44:26,530
(No wonder he won a gold medal. It was incredible.)

1204
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,330
- The record is 130cm! - 130cm.

1205
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,670
(Sung Bin sets the record of 130cm for high jumping.)

1206
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,600
- It's hard to jump on it. - It's unbelievable.

1207
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,170
- It's hard to climb on top. - How did he do this?

1208
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,610
- He's incredible. - Seriously.

1209
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:39,215
With Sung Bin's record of 130cm,

1210
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:40,540
Team Skeleton wins.

1211
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,210
- They earned one point. - We lost.

1212
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,920
(Team Skeleton wins 1 point.)

1213
00:44:44,925 --> 00:44:46,980
- For the next game... - I'll choose.

1214
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,855
- Sure. - Kwang Soo.

1215
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:51,350
- Kwang Soo will pick. - You must pick the one we wrote.

1216
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:55,195
- We wrote games we're good at too. - Exactly.

1217
00:44:55,535 --> 00:45:01,060
(As long as they don't pick Team Skeleton's games, they have a shot.)

1218
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,175
(Members wrote games suitable for variety shows instead of sports.)

1219
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:09,815
(He looks at them carefully.)

1220
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:12,955
He looks like an ascetic from a Chinese film.

1221
00:45:14,155 --> 00:45:19,525
(Let the card that we wrote present itself.)

1222
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:21,720
(He has finally picked a game.)

1223
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,790
- What is it? - What is it?

1224
00:45:23,795 --> 00:45:26,965
(Will it be a game that's advantageous to the members?)

1225
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:32,405
(It's running. He chooses the wrong card.)

1226
00:45:32,645 --> 00:45:33,930
- It's running. - Running?

1227
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,200
Hey, you.

1228
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,230
(How are we going to beat them in running?)

1229
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:40,340
- What is this? - Why does it relate to lower body?

1230
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,600
- Hold on. - What's wrong with you?

1231
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,840
You wrote running, didn't you?

1232
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,510
Team Skeleton submitted this game.

1233
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,540
- It's a 10m race. - If we only play their games...

1234
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,180
But why did Kwang Soo choose?

1235
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,255
(He's resentful.)

1236
00:45:52,595 --> 00:45:54,380
- My legs aren't good now. - I mean... It's just...

1237
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,850
(He becomes the scapegoat.)

1238
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:57,050
Kwang Soo.

1239
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,090
(His bad luck can't be cured.)

1240
00:45:59,095 --> 00:46:01,635
Everyone will start running at the sound of the whistle.

1241
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,960
The runner who crosses the finish line first will win.

1242
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,775
The winner will earn one point.

1243
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,710
How fast can you run 100m?

1244
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:13,340
I can run 100m in about 10 seconds.

1245
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,240
10... 10 seconds?

1246
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,610
- 10 seconds for 100m? - 10 seconds?

1247
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,010
- About 10 seconds? - About 10 seconds?

1248
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:20,320
- What about you, Sung Bin? - Exactly 11 seconds.

1249
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:21,940
- 11 seconds? - Okay.

1250
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,250
We might have a shot for a 10m race.

1251
00:46:23,255 --> 00:46:25,710
- 10m race? - Not really because...

1252
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,180
- he has a fast start. - That's right.

1253
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,950
- But you never know. It's 10m. - I forgot about that.

1254
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,750
He's faster in shorter distances.

1255
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,920
- He's known for his start. - He's the fastest in the world.

1256
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,905
(He's the fastest starter in the world.)

1257
00:46:37,675 --> 00:46:39,560
(Sung Bin broke the record with 4.59 seconds for his start.)

1258
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,675
("He Writes History at Every Game." "The Fastest Starter".)

1259
00:46:43,115 --> 00:46:48,045
(This Iron Man with muscular thighs flies on the ice.)

1260
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:51,110
He's the fastest in the world.

1261
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:53,140
Now that we've played a few games with them, I think...

1262
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,655
they are very cunning.

1263
00:46:54,885 --> 00:46:57,310
(They only wrote games that they'd be good at.)

1264
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,810
They only wrote games they're good at.

1265
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:00,720
- We can't do athletic exercises. - Hold on a second.

1266
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,490
When athletes star on variety shows,

1267
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,520
- they usually win, of course, - Let's have some fun.

1268
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,065
but they'd pick games we could play too.

1269
00:47:08,905 --> 00:47:11,930
All right. Ji Soo, why don't you come forward?

1270
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,630
(Han Na, Seok Jin, Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Ji Soo will go 1st.)

1271
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,530
The whistle. Hey, don't cheat.

1272
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:16,970
(Seok Jin from Team Gateball)

1273
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,970
- I'm nervous. - Who's going to give us the sign?

1274
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,240
- Ji Soo, we might win, you know. - Yes?

1275
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,215
- He might not make it. - Of course.

1276
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,985
(Ji Soo from Team Skeleton)

1277
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:27,740
Get ready.

1278
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,210
(Get ready.)

1279
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,480
All right. Hey, your foot.

1280
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,080
(His foot crosses the line.)

1281
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,220
- Kwang Soo, move back. - Hey.

1282
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,265
(This cunning runner gets caught for the false start.)

1283
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:40,360
Kwang Soo has long legs.

1284
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,790
- Look at Han Na. - You never know.

1285
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,390
- Jae Seok, look at Han Na. - Han Na, that's not fair.

1286
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:46,260
Let her take a step forward.

1287
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,860
- No, no. - I can't?

1288
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,145
(Matches must always be fair.)

1289
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:53,500
We don't need to sabotage each other.

1290
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,400
- That's right. - We have to defeat them.

1291
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,240
(The race comes down to the national team and members of Running Man.)

1292
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,040
Did you see that? He's leaning forward.

1293
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,110
(Starting position for the win)

1294
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,450
You should copy him.

1295
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,810
- How do I do that? - Lean forward.

1296
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,425
- Who will give us the signal? - All right. We have the whistle.

1297
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:09,320
Get ready.

1298
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:14,195
(I cannot lose even if I'm on a variety show.)

1299
00:48:14,535 --> 00:48:16,135
- Wait. - Hold on.

1300
00:48:18,805 --> 00:48:20,675
- Wait. - Hold on.

1301
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:22,535
- What was that? - Ji Soo.

1302
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:24,775
Can a national athlete do that?

1303
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:26,970
(Embarrassment surges through him.)

1304
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:27,970
- Wait. - I'm sorry.

1305
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,170
Can a national athlete do that?

1306
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,870
- Must he do his best? - What's wrong with you?

1307
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,610
- You're really going to try hard? - I'm sorry.

1308
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,380
- Okay. Fine. I'll do it. - I'm sorry.

1309
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,425
Do you have to stand in that order?

1310
00:48:36,825 --> 00:48:38,210
Let's switch our places.

1311
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,925
- Why isn't Ji Soo in the middle? - Right, let's do that.

1312
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:45,295
Light shoulder bumping is allowed, right?

1313
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,930
(He pushes with his shoulder even before the start.)

1314
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,360
You're being nasty, Kwang Soo.

1315
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,360
Kwang Soo looks like an arch.

1316
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:56,570
Come here, Kwang Soo. Ji Soo, go to the middle.

1317
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,200
(The race is already nasty from the start.)

1318
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,500
Get ready.

1319
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,315
Wait. What's this from the start?

1320
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:09,140
(Jae Seok tightly holds onto Kwang Soo's clothes.)

1321
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,910
- Listen. - We haven't even started.

1322
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:13,150
- Don't do that. - We haven't even started.

1323
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,230
- What are you doing? - He makes his cheating so obvious.

1324
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:18,650
He grabbed it to feel secured.

1325
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,420
That's right. I grabbed it to feel secured.

1326
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,490
- Why would you grab it? - Seriously.

1327
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,890
- Let's not cheat. - Don't cheat.

1328
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:27,300
- You always... - Don't cheat.

1329
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,060
This is sports.

1330
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,970
Why are you scolding me? I didn't do anything.

1331
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,270
- Don't cheat. - I just don't like your face.

1332
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,400
This is just an outfit. I look normal.

1333
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,340
- "Normal"? - Goodness.

1334
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,040
If you touch, it's cheating, and you'll be eliminated.

1335
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,140
- Okay. - Get ready.

1336
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,780
(The game really starts.)

1337
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,450
(It's a 10m run.)

1338
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:48,020
(Initial concentration could defeat a national team player.)

1339
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,165
(10m run starts.)

1340
00:49:53,465 --> 00:49:55,090
(They exclaim in an instant.)

1341
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:58,305
(What's the result of this short yet competitive race?)

1342
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:01,300
(Ji Soo springs out as expected.)

1343
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,700
(He finishes the race first.)

1344
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,600
They weren't even close.

1345
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,840
He's so fast.

1346
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,870
(National team members are on a different level.)

1347
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:13,540
- He's very fast. - He's really fast.

1348
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:14,540
He's so fast.

1349
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,380
Ji Soo places 1st in 2.36 seconds. Kwang Soo places 2nd.

1350
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,820
That was so close.

1351
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,880
- Good job, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1352
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,950
I was so close to Ji Soo.

1353
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:25,425
(Ji Soo and Kwang Soo make the cut.)

1354
00:50:26,535 --> 00:50:28,535
Next up is Sung Bin.

1355
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:30,260
- Sang Yeob. - Yes?

1356
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,560
I can do it.

1357
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,700
This is the final round.

1358
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,560
You never know.

1359
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,900
(Sung Bin and Jong Kook compete.)

1360
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,170
(Se Chan from Team Gateball)

1361
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,700
(Sang Yeob from Team Bobsleigh)

1362
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,670
(Sung Bin from Team Skeleton)

1363
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:47,280
(Jong Kook from Team Soohorang and Human-faced Bird)

1364
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,040
(Jin Young from Team Curling)

1365
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,350
- Get ready. - Get ready.

1366
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,450
(This is the actual, final round.)

1367
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,495
Set.

1368
00:50:56,095 --> 00:51:01,035
(Set...)

1369
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:06,440
(They expected the whistle.)

1370
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:08,175
(He loses his balance.)

1371
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:14,340
(Gosh, what are you doing?)

1372
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,110
Can you give us the count instead?

1373
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:20,040
Come on. I thought it was the start.

1374
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,355
(He misses the start signal.)

1375
00:51:22,085 --> 00:51:23,655
Let's go. Get ready.

1376
00:51:24,195 --> 00:51:25,450
Set.

1377
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,850
(Jokes are over. It's time to run.)

1378
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:31,150
(It's impossible to predict the result.)

1379
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,960
(Team 2 for 10m run starts.)

1380
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,505
(It's Jong Kook versus Sung Bin.)

1381
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:39,905
- What? - You're close.

1382
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:46,515
(It's difficult to determine the winner.)

1383
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:48,375
- What happened? - They were so fast.

1384
00:51:48,385 --> 00:51:49,570
(Both of them were fast.)

1385
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,110
- What happened? - They went in.

1386
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,480
I think Jong Kook won.

1387
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:56,985
- Jong Kook was faster. - He's the fastest runner among us.

1388
00:51:58,555 --> 00:52:04,550
(Determining the winner on slow motion)

1389
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,835
(Jong Kook finished first.)

1390
00:52:07,865 --> 00:52:09,835
First place is...

1391
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:12,830
- Jong Kook, and Sung Bin is second. - Both made it.

1392
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:14,130
Okay.

1393
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,230
(Do I have to play hard?)

1394
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,505
Goodness.

1395
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:19,970
The whole team passed.

1396
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,880
Jong Kook might be the winner.

1397
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,170
- It's a fight of pride. - We need a plan.

1398
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,740
- Let's make a plan. - Come this way.

1399
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,840
Two of you, come here.

1400
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,740
(Team Soohorang and Human-faced Bird against Team Skeleton)

1401
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,050
We've been running for eight years.

1402
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,480
- Let's go. - We ran once a week.

1403
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,650
That's true.

1404
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,980
There's no cheating.

1405
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,320
- No cheating. - No cheating.

1406
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,520
Stand in between them.

1407
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,920
Kwang Soo, why are you standing next to them?

1408
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Why are you standing there?

1409
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,365
Kwang Soo can do it.

1410
00:52:42,635 --> 00:52:44,505
- Show them, Kwang Soo. - Get ready.

1411
00:52:45,235 --> 00:52:48,070
- Wait. Wait a minute. - Be careful.

1412
00:52:48,075 --> 00:52:49,230
Get ready.

1413
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,545
(Their first step needs to be ahead to win.)

1414
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:53,515
Set.

1415
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:56,375
Get ready.

1416
00:52:56,655 --> 00:52:58,085
Set.

1417
00:52:58,285 --> 00:52:59,510
- Start over. - Gosh.

1418
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,540
- Come on. - I'm sorry.

1419
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,710
(He always starts before.)

1420
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,090
- What are you doing? - I'm sorry.

1421
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:07,080
It's a warning.

1422
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,480
- He must be nervous. - Jong Kook is being sensitive.

1423
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,795
It's a warning.

1424
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:14,920
Athletes don't want to come to the show because of Jong Kook.

1425
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:16,395
What do you mean?

1426
00:53:16,975 --> 00:53:18,465
It's hard for me too.

1427
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:21,575
It's hard for me too!

1428
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:24,745
- No... - I worked out until 2:30am!

1429
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:28,900
Wait. It's not hard.

1430
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,570
Nobody told you to work out.

1431
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:31,670
He's so funny.

1432
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,145
It's not easy.

1433
00:53:34,155 --> 00:53:35,510
Get ready.

1434
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:38,085
(The war of stars starts.)

1435
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:41,720
(Running Man versus National Team)

1436
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:46,526
Get ready.

1437
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:49,095
(The war of stars starts.)

1438
00:53:49,196 --> 00:53:52,732
(Running Man versus National Team)

1439
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:54,134
Start.

1440
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:57,137
(Sung Bin falls down.)

1441
00:53:57,137 --> 00:54:00,774
(It's a neck and neck match between Jong Kook and Ji Soo.)

1442
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:01,942
Who won?

1443
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:05,078
(Jong Kook competes against a national team member.)

1444
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,713
- Who won? - Who was it?

1445
00:54:06,713 --> 00:54:08,215
(Did Jong Kook win?)

1446
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,183
- I think Jong Kook won. - Did he?

1447
00:54:10,183 --> 00:54:11,551
Jong Kook.

1448
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:12,886
He won.

1449
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:16,356
(They finished almost at the same time.)

1450
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:19,059
- Sung Bin slipped. - He slipped.

1451
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:20,327
That's right.

1452
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:24,531
(Sung Bin falls behind as he slips from the start.)

1453
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,534
He usually doesn't do it,

1454
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:29,970
but Sung Bin held the start position during skeleton.

1455
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:33,640
(He held the start position during skeleton.)

1456
00:54:34,074 --> 00:54:35,542
However, this time,

1457
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:36,776
- this is what he did. - That's why he won.

1458
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:38,645
- He was determined. - Did he slip?

1459
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:40,780
He started from the skeleton start position...

1460
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,482
in the beginning.

1461
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:44,017
(The ice surface was easier.)

1462
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:46,086
This is exciting.

1463
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:47,587
He slipped.

1464
00:54:49,789 --> 00:54:52,859
Do we measure based on the head or the foot?

1465
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,261
Wait.

1466
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:56,229
(We must be wise about this.)

1467
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:57,464
Wait a minute.

1468
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,299
Let's ask Sung Bin.

1469
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,667
It's based on the chest.

1470
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:01,835
- The chest? - The chest.

1471
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:03,169
- Is it the chest? - Yes.

1472
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:05,005
- It's the same as marathon. - Right.

1473
00:55:05,005 --> 00:55:06,239
That's good.

1474
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:11,778
Did you run with your chest pushed forward?

1475
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:13,580
Is that why?

1476
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,448
- All right. - I had my chest forward.

1477
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:17,450
- The winner is... - I pushed out my chest.

1478
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:22,722
(It was a neck and neck final match.)

1479
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:24,090
Ji Soo places first.

1480
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:26,226
(His head and chest finished first.)

1481
00:55:26,226 --> 00:55:28,862
His head and chest came 1st, but Jong Kook's foot came in 1st.

1482
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:30,430
- His foot? - Yes.

1483
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:38,338
(Ji Soo's chest comes in 1st. Jong Kook's foot comes in 1st.)

1484
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,307
Look, Jong Kook's right foot came in first.

1485
00:55:40,307 --> 00:55:41,474
- If it were short track... - Wait.

1486
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:43,543
Short track counts the foot that comes in first.

1487
00:55:43,543 --> 00:55:45,011
If it were short track...

1488
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:46,246
All right.

1489
00:55:46,246 --> 00:55:49,449
As the result of the 10m run,

1490
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,952
since Kim Ji Soo won first place,

1491
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:55,388
Team Skeleton wins. They earn one point.

1492
00:55:55,388 --> 00:55:56,890
That was so close.

1493
00:55:58,658 --> 00:56:01,261
Let's hear voice mimicry.

1494
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:03,697
We'll play voice mimicry this time.

1495
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:05,265
- It's a relay. - It's a relay game.

1496
00:56:05,265 --> 00:56:06,433
The one who can't do it is eliminated.

1497
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,867
- That's great. - Do you understand?

1498
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:10,270
It includes animals and objects.

1499
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,504
Get ready.

1500
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:13,673
Ready. Start.

1501
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:16,876
"Goodness, stay out of it."

1502
00:56:16,876 --> 00:56:18,278
What was that?

1503
00:56:18,545 --> 00:56:22,349
(She mimics Joo Hyun.)

1504
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,150
- Wasn't she simply cursing? - No.

1505
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,119
(If you mumble while cursing, is it mimicking Joo Hyun?)

1506
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:28,288
Then I'd just curse too.

1507
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,357
(So Min succeeds.)

1508
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:32,158
- You did it, right? - Yes.

1509
00:56:32,158 --> 00:56:33,159
Da Hee?

1510
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:34,327
(Next is Da Hee's turn.)

1511
00:56:34,327 --> 00:56:36,663
"Ye Ri, you wench. Mom!"

1512
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:39,265
("Ye Ri, you wench. Mom!")

1513
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:40,667
(Da Hee succeeds.)

1514
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:43,470
- Good job. - Jin Young?

1515
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:44,537
Jin Young?

1516
00:56:44,537 --> 00:56:46,539
(Jin Young is here.)

1517
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,408
"Hey, what kind of situation is this?"

1518
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:50,644
"I'm upset right now."

1519
00:56:50,644 --> 00:56:52,379
She sounds just like her.

1520
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:56,683
(An Seong Daek's line, "What kind of situation is this?")

1521
00:56:56,683 --> 00:56:59,986
(She mimics her perfectly.)

1522
00:57:00,253 --> 00:57:02,155
She's good.

1523
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:04,791
She sounds just like her.

1524
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,126
Next is Han Na.

1525
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:08,662
(Whom will Han Na mimic?)

1526
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:11,231
(Growling)

1527
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:14,367
(It's a new type of mimicry.)

1528
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,469
- A dog. - Was she mimicking a sick person?

1529
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:17,804
It works well for her.

1530
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:19,673
Can you be more enthusiastic?

1531
00:57:19,673 --> 00:57:20,974
What should I do?

1532
00:57:20,974 --> 00:57:22,442
- Just do anything. - Right.

1533
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:24,377
Even I can do that.

1534
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:26,179
What is she doing?

1535
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:29,282
(What is she doing?)

1536
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,483
What's that?

1537
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,218
- A horse? - No. It's a train.

1538
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:34,320
It's a train approaching from far away.

1539
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:36,723
(A train is approaching.)

1540
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:37,757
Look at her face.

1541
00:57:37,757 --> 00:57:39,359
(A train is approaching.)

1542
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,760
Train, my foot.

1543
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,898
(Train, my foot.)

1544
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:46,199
What?

1545
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,867
- Wasn't it okay? - She's being unreasonable.

1546
00:57:47,867 --> 00:57:50,203
- It's ridiculous. - Hold on.

1547
00:57:50,203 --> 00:57:51,838
Wasn't it convincing?

1548
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:53,473
- Wasn't it? - Have you tried it before?

1549
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,808
- No. This is the first time. - It is?

1550
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,576
- Yes. - It doesn't count.

1551
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,145
- Ji Hyo. - I'll do a really short one.

1552
00:57:59,145 --> 00:58:00,447
Okay.

1553
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:02,549
"All right."

1554
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:04,117
- Who is that? - What's that?

1555
00:58:04,117 --> 00:58:05,919
The SBS voice actor...

1556
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:07,787
I think I recognize it.

1557
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:08,888
Give her another chance.

1558
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:12,092
- Listen carefully. - All right.

1559
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:13,927
- What is that? - That's just your voice.

1560
00:58:13,927 --> 00:58:15,929
(Cold)

1561
00:58:15,929 --> 00:58:17,864
- I thought it sounded like him. - Seok Jin.

1562
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:20,467
"Hello, everyone, I'm Hwang Su Gwan."

1563
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,068
(Fail)

1564
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:24,804
Hey. It sounded just like him.

1565
00:58:25,638 --> 00:58:29,743
(This is how Dr. Hwang Su Gwan sounded in the 90s.)

1566
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:34,547
(This is Seok Jin's impression of him in 2018.)

1567
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:36,850
(What's with the judgment?)

1568
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:37,951
We've heard it so many times.

1569
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,519
It sounded just like him.

1570
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,121
- It sounded exactly like him. - Everyone.

1571
00:58:41,121 --> 00:58:43,456
"Smile because it's Monday."

1572
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:46,226
- "Smile big on Tuesday." - It's him.

1573
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,828
"Smile for your life on Thursday."

1574
00:58:48,828 --> 00:58:51,664
- "On Saturday..." - That's enough.

1575
00:58:51,664 --> 00:58:52,899
"I'm Hwang Su Gwan."

1576
00:58:52,899 --> 00:58:54,868
- It sounds just like him. - "I'm Hwang Su Gwan."

1577
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,036
- Try something else. - What?

1578
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,606
Let me try Yoon Si Nae.

1579
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:01,574
- I'll sing "For No Reason". - Okay.

1580
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:05,011
(For no reason)

1581
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:06,679
(I said it first)

1582
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:09,349
- That's Hwang Su Gwan. - That's Hwang Su Gwan.

1583
00:59:10,016 --> 00:59:13,052
"Hello, everyone, I'm Hwang Su Gwan."

1584
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:15,722
Young people don't know who those people are.

1585
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:17,257
You just want to fail me.

1586
00:59:17,257 --> 00:59:19,759
Maeng Gu sings Jin Young's song, "Goodbye".

1587
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,795
- Okay. - Se Chan is good at impressions.

1588
00:59:21,795 --> 00:59:25,331
(Goodbye)

1589
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:27,867
(Struggling)

1590
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:34,440
(Goodbye)

1591
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:37,443
- All right. - Why are you failing all of us?

1592
00:59:37,877 --> 00:59:41,080
- Why is that? - No matter what we do...

1593
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,649
Didn't I sound just like Hwang Su Gwan?

1594
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:44,117
- "Hello, everyone." - I'll give you another chance.

1595
00:59:44,117 --> 00:59:45,285
- "I'm Hwang Su Gwan." - Do something else.

1596
00:59:45,285 --> 00:59:46,352
- I'll mimic a water deer. - A water deer.

1597
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:47,887
- A wild water deer. - Good.

1598
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:49,122
I know how they sound.

1599
00:59:49,122 --> 00:59:53,259
(How will Se Chan mimic a water deer?)

1600
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:58,498
Why are you failing us?

1601
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:01,701
(This is how a water deer sounds.)

1602
01:00:01,701 --> 01:00:03,069
Hey.

1603
01:00:04,003 --> 01:00:06,039
That's right. That's how they sound.

1604
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:08,141
- That's how they sound. - It's so funny.

1605
01:00:08,141 --> 01:00:10,043
- It counts. - It counts.

1606
01:00:10,043 --> 01:00:11,477
- Please start. - A cuckoo.

1607
01:00:11,477 --> 01:00:12,912
- A cuckoo. - A cuckoo? Nice.

1608
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:14,747
(Do you want to hear a cuckoo?)

1609
01:00:14,747 --> 01:00:20,920
(It might be hard for an athlete. How will Ji Soo mimic a cuckoo?)

1610
01:00:22,322 --> 01:00:24,357
(Cuckoo)

1611
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:27,360
(It sounds just like a cuckoo.)

1612
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:29,629
(We're in trouble.)

1613
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,464
- I'm in trouble. - It counts.

1614
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:33,399
- It's an animal. - He's good at it.

1615
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:35,301
It sounded just like a cuckoo.

1616
01:00:36,836 --> 01:00:41,808
(Compare it to a real cuckoo.)

1617
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:45,311
(It sounds as if two cuckoos are communicating.)

1618
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:49,215
- Oh no. He's really good. - I have to accept this.

1619
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:52,018
- It sounded just like the bird. - I'm not sure what I can do.

1620
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:54,153
- I'll try Raccoon from "Tazza". - Raccoon?

1621
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,455
Raccoon?

1622
01:00:55,455 --> 01:00:57,657
(Raccoon from "Tazza"?)

1623
01:00:58,024 --> 01:01:03,129
(Raccoon is the scene-stealer with a deep voice.)

1624
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:05,431
- I'll be objective. - It'll be short.

1625
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:07,867
(Sung Bin looks shy. How will he mimic him?)

1626
01:01:07,867 --> 01:01:09,435
I just need money.

1627
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:13,473
(I just need money.)

1628
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:14,807
I just need money.

1629
01:01:14,807 --> 01:01:16,109
(Was Raccoon just here?)

1630
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:17,143
- That's amazing. - It was okay, right?

1631
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:18,144
I admit it.

1632
01:01:18,144 --> 01:01:20,213
- He's really good. - What was that?

1633
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,182
(Even his mimicry is top-notch.)

1634
01:01:23,182 --> 01:01:24,350
Sang Yeob.

1635
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:26,552
(Even the impression genius feels burdened.)

1636
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:29,956
- Yu Hae Jin in "The Pirates". - Okay. "The Pirates".

1637
01:01:29,956 --> 01:01:32,592
(Yu Hae Jin in "The Pirates"?)

1638
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:39,232
(Yu Hae Jin played a talkative and frivolous pirate.)

1639
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:47,040
(Sang Yeob takes out his secret weapon...)

1640
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,742
(against the versatile athletes.)

1641
01:01:49,742 --> 01:01:51,444
- "The Pirates". - Okay. "The Pirates".

1642
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:53,379
"Have you ever been to a beach?"

1643
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:57,250
"It's spectacular."

1644
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:00,053
(It's spectacular.)

1645
01:02:00,486 --> 01:02:02,388
(That was spectacular.)

1646
01:02:02,388 --> 01:02:03,923
Unbelievable.

1647
01:02:03,923 --> 01:02:06,559
- Nice. - "It's spectacular."

1648
01:02:06,926 --> 01:02:08,661
Sang Yeob is on fire.

1649
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:10,430
Let me take a break.

1650
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:11,998
- Take care of your voice. - Okay.

1651
01:02:13,433 --> 01:02:16,302
- I'll mimic a car. - Okay.

1652
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:18,938
(Roar)

1653
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:19,973
Two cars.

1654
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:21,441
(Roaring)

1655
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:24,510
(It's a novice-level impression.)

1656
01:02:24,677 --> 01:02:26,045
- Three cars. - Stop it.

1657
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:27,280
(It's a novice-level impression.)

1658
01:02:27,313 --> 01:02:28,681
Isn't that a saw?

1659
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,284
- Kwang Soo. - What's that?

1660
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:35,154
"Goal." Why?

1661
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:36,756
(Fail)

1662
01:02:36,756 --> 01:02:38,624
- What's wrong? - Why?

1663
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,059
- It's weird. - It sounded just like him.

1664
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,327
- It's weird. - It's Shin Moon Sun.

1665
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:42,862
- Try again. - It sounded like him.

1666
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,397
"Shoot me."

1667
01:02:45,198 --> 01:02:46,566
- I know that one. - "Shoot me."

1668
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:48,634
- Is that Shin Moon Sun? - No.

1669
01:02:48,634 --> 01:02:50,169
Make up your mind.

1670
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:52,338
- Say, "Shin Moon Sun". - Shin Moon Sun.

1671
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:53,906
- Why? - I thought it was Ahn Sung Ki.

1672
01:02:53,906 --> 01:02:56,142
- I thought it was him. - It was Ahn Sung Ki.

1673
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:57,977
Is this a quiz?

1674
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:01,848
- Is this a quiz? - Jong Kook.

1675
01:03:01,848 --> 01:03:04,183
- I can't do anything. - Then you're out.

1676
01:03:04,183 --> 01:03:06,252
"Will I be the king?"

1677
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:07,587
No.

1678
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:11,858
(You won't be the king.)

1679
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:15,361
Jae Seok has already made up his mind.

1680
01:03:15,528 --> 01:03:18,965
You're out. Let's start again. Those eliminated can't participate.

1681
01:03:18,965 --> 01:03:20,099
One more round.

1682
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:21,467
(Round 2 starts from So Min.)

1683
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:22,969
(Getting ready)

1684
01:03:24,103 --> 01:03:26,939
"Hello, I'm Bae Cheol Soo of 'Bae Cheol Soo's Music Camp'."

1685
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:30,076
(Bae Cheol Soo's Music Camp)

1686
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,311
Good job.

1687
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:34,347
- She improved. - She's not good.

1688
01:03:34,347 --> 01:03:36,282
She's just brazen.

1689
01:03:36,282 --> 01:03:38,584
- You just have to be brazen. - She doesn't care.

1690
01:03:38,584 --> 01:03:40,386
- She's so brazen. - She is good.

1691
01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:41,687
She's shameless.

1692
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:42,989
Da Hee.

1693
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:46,059
"If you keep doing this, you'll end up having bloody stool."

1694
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:49,062
(If you keep doing this, you'll end up having bloody stool.)

1695
01:03:49,062 --> 01:03:50,663
(Fail)

1696
01:03:50,663 --> 01:03:53,099
Who's that? It's Baek Yun Shik.

1697
01:03:53,099 --> 01:03:54,767
(It's supposed to be Baek Yun Shik.)

1698
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:55,968
Jin Young.

1699
01:03:56,135 --> 01:03:59,338
(Barking)

1700
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:01,507
(She doesn't stop even when she is eliminated.)

1701
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:02,708
Step back, please.

1702
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:03,810
- "Hello." - Do you have one?

1703
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:05,411
- Kim Hye Soo in "Tazza". - All right.

1704
01:04:05,411 --> 01:04:07,547
(Kim Hye Soo in "Tazza"?)

1705
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:10,349
(Kim Hye Soo was frustrated and infuriated in this scene.)

1706
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:13,486
I can shoot you!

1707
01:04:14,754 --> 01:04:17,657
(How will Se Chan's version sound?)

1708
01:04:17,657 --> 01:04:19,992
"I can shoot you!"

1709
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:22,528
"I can shoot you!"

1710
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:24,163
- Stop. - "I can..."

1711
01:04:24,163 --> 01:04:26,933
- "I can really shoot you!" - You're out.

1712
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:28,701
- Why? - You're out.

1713
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:30,269
Let me try Grand Prince Suyang.

1714
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:32,305
Grand Prince Suyang. Good.

1715
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:37,243
(Jong Kook failed at it.)

1716
01:04:37,243 --> 01:04:38,611
Played by Lee Jung Jae.

1717
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:40,580
"Will I be the king?"

1718
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,316
(Will I be the king?)

1719
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:44,350
It was okay.

1720
01:04:44,350 --> 01:04:46,519
(Pass)

1721
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,221
How was it different?

1722
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:49,889
- What's the difference? - Do it again.

1723
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:52,792
- What's the difference? - "Will I be the king?"

1724
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:54,427
- Aren't I better? - Please do it again.

1725
01:04:54,427 --> 01:04:56,362
"Will I be the king?"

1726
01:04:56,429 --> 01:04:58,865
- What? - Hey.

1727
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,099
What is this?

1728
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,702
- I'm being objective, not biased. - Are you serious?

1729
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:05,238
- "Will I be the king?" - I've heard it many times.

1730
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:06,439
Yes.

1731
01:05:06,439 --> 01:05:08,007
- Sang Yeob. - "Will I be the king?"

1732
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:10,243
- Sang Yeob. - I'll mimic Jang Hyuk...

1733
01:05:10,243 --> 01:05:14,180
saying Choi Min Soo's last line in "Sandglass".

1734
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,414
Okay.

1735
01:05:15,414 --> 01:05:17,650
- Jang Hyuk. - Look at my mouth.

1736
01:05:19,285 --> 01:05:22,989
"I thought I could have you, Eon Nyeon!"

1737
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:25,291
You've done that too many times now.

1738
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:27,827
- This is not okay. - "I can shoot you!"

1739
01:05:27,827 --> 01:05:30,429
- "I can shoot you!" - Isn't ours better?

1740
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:32,098
- Which one's better? - "I can shoot you!"

1741
01:05:32,098 --> 01:05:34,534
(While they're fighting...)

1742
01:05:34,634 --> 01:05:38,137
"Look at these bullets."

1743
01:05:38,137 --> 01:05:41,541
(Random)

1744
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:44,410
"Two bullets from Vladivostok..."

1745
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,979
- What are you doing? - What are you doing right now?

1746
01:05:46,979 --> 01:05:49,148
- What is this? - It's your fault.

1747
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:52,151
- "2 bullets..." - "2 bullets..."

1748
01:05:52,218 --> 01:05:53,853
Stop it.

1749
01:05:53,853 --> 01:05:55,354
- "2 bullets"? - What are you doing?

1750
01:05:55,354 --> 01:05:56,656
(Please come up with something new.)

1751
01:05:57,323 --> 01:05:59,859
- If So Min succeeds, we'll win. - That's right.

1752
01:05:59,859 --> 01:06:01,294
- So Min. - If she fails, do another round.

1753
01:06:01,294 --> 01:06:02,495
So Min, you can do this!

1754
01:06:02,929 --> 01:06:07,300
(I need something new.)

1755
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:13,339
(Laughing)

1756
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:15,241
- Isn't that Kim Je Dong? - Kim Je... You're right.

1757
01:06:15,241 --> 01:06:16,909
- How did you know? - Isn't that Kim Je Dong?

1758
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,444
(How did you know?)

1759
01:06:18,444 --> 01:06:19,645
How did I know?

1760
01:06:19,645 --> 01:06:21,347
- Do it again. - How did I know?

1761
01:06:21,347 --> 01:06:22,448
Do it again.

1762
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:25,218
- It must have been similar. - How did I know?

1763
01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:27,520
- It doesn't sound the same. - Do it again.

1764
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,821
Do it again.

1765
01:06:28,854 --> 01:06:32,458
(Laughing)

1766
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:34,427
Isn't that just a crazy woman?

1767
01:06:34,427 --> 01:06:35,828
It's Kim Je Dong.

1768
01:06:35,828 --> 01:06:38,064
(Although it's a bit scary, So Min's impression is accepted.)

1769
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:40,333
- It's Kim Je Dong. - I knew it.

1770
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,268
The winner of the mimicry contest...

1771
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:44,704
is Team Curling!

1772
01:06:44,704 --> 01:06:46,872
(Thanks to So Min, Team Curling wins.)

1773
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:49,442
She'll tell people that she won a mimicry contest.

1774
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:51,377
She's so brazen.

1775
01:06:51,444 --> 01:06:53,279
(In a moment)

1776
01:06:53,946 --> 01:06:56,949
(Don't trust anybody.)

1777
01:06:56,983 --> 01:06:59,719
(The peaceful games are interrupted by mysterious incidents.)

1778
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:02,488
(The culprit is among us.)

1779
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:05,825
(Today's real mission will be revealed shortly.)

1780
01:07:07,126 --> 01:07:08,761
(And...)

1781
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:11,030
(The strength competition)

1782
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:15,134
(Who will be stronger, Sung Bin or Jong Kook?)

1783
01:07:15,134 --> 01:07:17,370
- Pick one. - To be fair,

1784
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:18,871
- Ji Soo should pick one. - Pick one.

1785
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:20,139
Ji Soo.

1786
01:07:20,973 --> 01:07:22,575
(Seok Jin stops.)

1787
01:07:23,676 --> 01:07:25,077
Not Seok Jin.

1788
01:07:25,077 --> 01:07:27,213
- Please pick, Ji Soo. - Please.

1789
01:07:27,213 --> 01:07:30,850
(What's the 4th game?)

1790
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:32,852
What is it?

1791
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:35,054
- Long jump. - It's long jump?

1792
01:07:36,722 --> 01:07:38,157
(They have to compete in long jump against the national team?)

1793
01:07:38,157 --> 01:07:40,926
- It's all the same. - This is not fun.

1794
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:43,329
Why did you pick that? Pick again.

1795
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:45,097
- This is all they have. - I know.

1796
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:46,399
Why do you keep picking these?

1797
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:48,134
Is this a competition against the national team?

1798
01:07:48,134 --> 01:07:50,202
He used to do long jump.

1799
01:07:50,202 --> 01:07:54,573
Please pick one person to represent your team.

1800
01:07:54,573 --> 01:07:56,342
Who wrote this?

1801
01:07:56,342 --> 01:07:58,244
They wrote four,

1802
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:00,579
- and three got picked. - How's that possible?

1803
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:04,350
By the way, who wrote Jee Seok Jin's Game?

1804
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:06,852
Use common sense.

1805
01:08:06,852 --> 01:08:08,187
- Even if it gets aired, - This is too hilarious.

1806
01:08:08,187 --> 01:08:11,157
you should pick a fun game that we can play with the players.

1807
01:08:11,157 --> 01:08:12,258
What is this?

1808
01:08:12,258 --> 01:08:14,260
- Why Jee Seok Jin's Game? - It's so much fun.

1809
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,829
- It's so much fun. - That's beside the point.

1810
01:08:16,829 --> 01:08:19,332
- I wrote arm wrestling. - That's not good either.

1811
01:08:19,332 --> 01:08:20,833
His arms are so thick.

1812
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,535
That doesn't mean he's good at arm wrestling.

1813
01:08:22,535 --> 01:08:24,303
Why did you write "mimicry" then?

1814
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:26,439
What are we supposed to do?

1815
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:29,041
- Who wrote that? - That's not what I meant.

1816
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,876
How far did you go in long jump?

1817
01:08:30,876 --> 01:08:34,313
- I went to college for it. - He's a former player.

1818
01:08:34,313 --> 01:08:37,550
- He's a former, long jump player. - He has no sense of conscience.

1819
01:08:38,117 --> 01:08:39,819
(What conscience?)

1820
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:41,821
- What do you mean? - I need to scold you.

1821
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:45,057
From what I heard, there's another long jump player.

1822
01:08:45,057 --> 01:08:46,692
- Who? - Yoon Sang too.

1823
01:08:46,692 --> 01:08:48,561
- Really? - How far did you get?

1824
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:50,496
I did it in elementary school.

1825
01:08:50,496 --> 01:08:52,264
- What sport was it? - Track. I did long jump.

1826
01:08:52,264 --> 01:08:53,799
- Really? - Yes.

1827
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,868
They usually don't do it in elementary school.

1828
01:08:55,868 --> 01:08:57,603
Can you show us?

1829
01:08:57,603 --> 01:08:58,871
- Me? - Yes.

1830
01:08:58,871 --> 01:09:00,439
(He's surprised.)

1831
01:09:00,706 --> 01:09:02,241
I'll try it.

1832
01:09:02,908 --> 01:09:05,811
- I had no idea. - It's suede.

1833
01:09:06,445 --> 01:09:09,081
(He enters with suede shoes.)

1834
01:09:09,081 --> 01:09:10,149
You can be fast in those shoes.

1835
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:11,150
(That was random.)

1836
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,318
You can be really fast in those shoes.

1837
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:14,487
Suede shoes are good.

1838
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:15,621
(He gets ready to jump with suede dress shoes.)

1839
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:17,656
He has to wipe the bottom.

1840
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:19,992
(How good is Yoon Sang in long jump?)

1841
01:09:19,992 --> 01:09:21,227
I'm looking forward to this.

1842
01:09:21,227 --> 01:09:23,162
He has a good body.

1843
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:24,897
He has good proportions.

1844
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,465
You're handsome.

1845
01:09:26,465 --> 01:09:27,800
Run-up is the important part.

1846
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:29,201
- All right. - I'll start.

1847
01:09:29,535 --> 01:09:30,736
Start.

1848
01:09:30,736 --> 01:09:32,838
(The siren is heard.)

1849
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:35,207
(It's been a while since I felt like this.)

1850
01:09:35,207 --> 01:09:38,577
(At this moment, he's not an anchor.)

1851
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:40,079
(He's a bird with suede shoes on.)

1852
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:42,181
- Why is he making that face? - I know, right?

1853
01:09:42,748 --> 01:09:44,483
(Flying)

1854
01:09:45,451 --> 01:09:47,253
(His legs spread apart.)

1855
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:51,257
(He jumped over 3m 50cm.)

1856
01:09:51,257 --> 01:09:54,293
Are your pants okay?

1857
01:09:54,293 --> 01:09:56,796
(He spread his legs.)

1858
01:09:56,796 --> 01:09:57,897
My pants ripped.

1859
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,899
(Oh, my goodness)

1860
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:02,768
(His pants couldn't withstand his passion.)

1861
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:05,037
(This is an emergency.)

1862
01:10:05,037 --> 01:10:06,572
My bad.

1863
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:08,307
I heard his pants ripping.

1864
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:10,609
Why did you make him do that?

1865
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:12,077
(But he made everybody laugh by getting his pants ripped.)

1866
01:10:12,077 --> 01:10:13,679
- Are you all right? - It ripped.

1867
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,382
Yoon Sang, do you know what face you made?

1868
01:10:16,382 --> 01:10:17,450
When you were jumping...

1869
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,617
Hey, stop it.

1870
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:19,752
(The investigation has to continue.)

1871
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:21,053
- Stop it. - It ripped.

1872
01:10:21,053 --> 01:10:23,989
(The truth of the ripped pants)

1873
01:10:23,989 --> 01:10:26,492
- What are you doing? - I wanted to show that it was real.

1874
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:27,593
(They come up with an emergency solution.)

1875
01:10:27,593 --> 01:10:30,429
I hope you're okay with this. Are you all right?

1876
01:10:30,429 --> 01:10:31,897
You can join us, Yoon Sang.

1877
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:34,333
- You're a great athlete. - I agree.

1878
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:36,101
Let's start with long jump.

1879
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:39,071
We'll have one person from each team.

1880
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:40,739
Let's pick a variety of people.

1881
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:42,908
Let's mix up those who participated before...

1882
01:10:42,908 --> 01:10:44,977
and those who didn't.

1883
01:10:44,977 --> 01:10:46,645
- Seok Jin... - Stop it.

1884
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:49,148
- Why do you keep picking him? - What's wrong with you?

1885
01:10:49,148 --> 01:10:51,250
- His knees hurt. - Hold on.

1886
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,819
If he lands the wrong way, his knees will get injured.

1887
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:55,921
- You both ran, right? - Yes, we did.

1888
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:57,289
- Who did high jump? - Me.

1889
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:59,124
- It's his turn to do long jump. - That's fair.

1890
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:01,660
- It's not. - It's okay.

1891
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:03,329
It's okay.

1892
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:05,998
- Please come here. - Good job.

1893
01:11:05,998 --> 01:11:07,900
- Good luck. - All right.

1894
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,869
- Please give a round of applause. - Let's go.

1895
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:12,271
(Let's go, my team.)

1896
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:14,540
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1897
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:16,408
- Please go first. - Okay.

1898
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:20,846
- Seok Jin, use your thighs. - Okay.

1899
01:11:20,846 --> 01:11:22,348
Ready, set,

1900
01:11:22,748 --> 01:11:24,149
go.

1901
01:11:26,185 --> 01:11:28,454
(I'm 53 years old.)

1902
01:11:28,454 --> 01:11:32,358
(But at this moment, I'm a youth.)

1903
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:37,830
(He looks like an impala in the run-up. He has a strong will.)

1904
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:39,999
(Groaning)

1905
01:11:41,033 --> 01:11:42,735
(Collapsing)

1906
01:11:44,203 --> 01:11:45,738
There.

1907
01:11:45,905 --> 01:11:47,239
2m 30cm.

1908
01:11:47,239 --> 01:11:49,241
It's 2m 30cm.

1909
01:11:49,909 --> 01:11:51,377
(They feel bad for him.)

1910
01:11:51,377 --> 01:11:53,812
I feel bad for him.

1911
01:11:53,812 --> 01:11:55,247
What was that?

1912
01:11:55,247 --> 01:11:56,715
- What now? - Goodness.

1913
01:11:56,715 --> 01:11:58,817
This is not Running Man.

1914
01:11:59,285 --> 01:12:02,855
We have to be thankful that he's at least jumping.

1915
01:12:02,855 --> 01:12:04,223
Next.

1916
01:12:04,223 --> 01:12:08,227
(Kwang Soo, the human-faced bird, is up next.)

1917
01:12:08,227 --> 01:12:09,728
You can do it, Kwang Soo.

1918
01:12:09,862 --> 01:12:11,397
Ready.

1919
01:12:14,066 --> 01:12:15,568
Go.

1920
01:12:16,936 --> 01:12:19,338
- Look at his face. - Go.

1921
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:23,208
(The human-faced bird gets ready to take off.)

1922
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,677
(Dashing)

1923
01:12:24,677 --> 01:12:26,078
Foul.

1924
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:28,080
Foul.

1925
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,481
(Jae Seok calls a foul.)

1926
01:12:30,683 --> 01:12:33,185
(He crossed the line.)

1927
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:35,087
- My goodness. - Foul.

1928
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:39,858
(He jumped far, but it's a foul.)

1929
01:12:39,858 --> 01:12:42,061
You crossed the line. Foul.

1930
01:12:42,394 --> 01:12:43,829
- What? - It's a foul.

1931
01:12:43,829 --> 01:12:45,397
- What do you mean? - You crossed the line.

1932
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:47,366
- I did? - How far was that?

1933
01:12:47,366 --> 01:12:48,867
That was 4m 30cm.

1934
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:50,202
That's so far.

1935
01:12:50,202 --> 01:12:51,870
- 4m 30cm? - Yes.

1936
01:12:51,904 --> 01:12:53,205
Who's next?

1937
01:12:53,205 --> 01:12:54,707
- Haha. - Yes.

1938
01:12:54,707 --> 01:12:56,375
- I've never seen him do this. - Good luck.

1939
01:12:56,375 --> 01:12:57,810
- Look at him. - Set...

1940
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:59,345
- You never know. - You don't.

1941
01:12:59,345 --> 01:13:02,648
I think he can get over 3m.

1942
01:13:03,315 --> 01:13:04,750
Good job.

1943
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:07,019
(His run-up has swag.)

1944
01:13:07,987 --> 01:13:10,222
Good job.

1945
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:12,992
- That looks cool. - Good job.

1946
01:13:12,992 --> 01:13:15,127
- Wait. - Hey.

1947
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:16,629
(Halting)

1948
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,597
(He's not ready to jump yet.)

1949
01:13:18,597 --> 01:13:21,634
- The start looked good. - You looked so cool though.

1950
01:13:21,634 --> 01:13:24,470
- That looked like high jump. - Are you doing high jump?

1951
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:25,804
You looked cool when you turned like that.

1952
01:13:25,804 --> 01:13:27,473
- You did. - Turn again.

1953
01:13:27,473 --> 01:13:29,642
Haha, that looked cool.

1954
01:13:29,808 --> 01:13:31,977
(He changes direction.)

1955
01:13:31,977 --> 01:13:34,113
- Turn. - Do it.

1956
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:37,983
- Good job. - It's working.

1957
01:13:37,983 --> 01:13:40,819
(The shorty's counterattack)

1958
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:41,987
What was that?

1959
01:13:41,987 --> 01:13:43,255
(It wasn't enough.)

1960
01:13:44,356 --> 01:13:47,259
- He barely made it. - You barely made it on the mat.

1961
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:49,228
(Dream and So Wool, I'm sorry that I'm too short.)

1962
01:13:49,228 --> 01:13:52,598
- What was that? - You barely made it on the mat.

1963
01:13:53,565 --> 01:13:55,868
Why did you run sideways?

1964
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:58,537
- I should have used my right leg. - You barely made it.

1965
01:13:58,537 --> 01:13:59,638
Da Hee.

1966
01:13:59,638 --> 01:14:00,806
Good luck.

1967
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:02,107
Da Hee.

1968
01:14:02,574 --> 01:14:04,677
Ji Soo is holding her hoodie.

1969
01:14:04,677 --> 01:14:05,878
(This looks like...)

1970
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:08,747
(a young lady and a butler.)

1971
01:14:08,747 --> 01:14:10,749
(He's obedient.)

1972
01:14:10,749 --> 01:14:12,251
He looks like Se Chan when he was Alfredo.

1973
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:14,053
- Alfredo? - Yes.

1974
01:14:14,053 --> 01:14:16,255
- He looks like Se Chan. - I agree.

1975
01:14:16,255 --> 01:14:18,490
- He's like Se Chan next to Han Na. - True.

1976
01:14:18,924 --> 01:14:21,427
- He's like Se Chan next to Na Eun. - I can see that.

1977
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,861
Good luck.

1978
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:24,196
- Go. - That's not the line.

1979
01:14:24,196 --> 01:14:26,331
You never know.

1980
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:29,068
(The long-legged woman with a burning ambition runs.)

1981
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:31,236
You never know.

1982
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:33,238
(She runs at full speed.)

1983
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:34,373
Here she comes.

1984
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:36,108
(Leaping)

1985
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:39,478
(I'm the advancing Da Hee.)

1986
01:14:39,478 --> 01:14:40,913
She made it.

1987
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:42,481
- It's closer than that. - A little bit.

1988
01:14:42,481 --> 01:14:43,816
70cm.

1989
01:14:43,816 --> 01:14:45,050
It's around 70cm.

1990
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:46,251
(She's first place with 2m 70cm.)

1991
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:48,253
You never know. This might be the highest.

1992
01:14:48,554 --> 01:14:50,089
You never know.

1993
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:51,957
Da Hee is good.

1994
01:14:52,057 --> 01:14:53,358
Ji Soo is next.

1995
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:55,160
(Ji Soo from Team Skeleton)

1996
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,196
- Ji Soo. - Good luck.

1997
01:14:57,196 --> 01:14:59,898
(He looks relaxed as he starts.)

1998
01:15:01,533 --> 01:15:03,736
(He gets his thighs warmed up.)

1999
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:08,674
(He ran powerfully toward the world.)

2000
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,809
(Let's fly again.)

2001
01:15:16,582 --> 01:15:19,518
(He actually flies.)

2002
01:15:21,253 --> 01:15:22,755
(What was that?)

2003
01:15:22,755 --> 01:15:25,491
- Where was it? - He flew.

2004
01:15:27,092 --> 01:15:31,897
(This comes from a national-level athlete's thighs.)

2005
01:15:33,165 --> 01:15:36,201
- Where was it? - He flew.

2006
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:39,037
- It's 4m 50cm. - 50cm.

2007
01:15:39,204 --> 01:15:40,606
He flew.

2008
01:15:40,606 --> 01:15:42,674
- That was good. - He's good.

2009
01:15:42,674 --> 01:15:45,077
- He's different. - He was so relaxed.

2010
01:15:45,144 --> 01:15:48,447
- He flew. - He did.

2011
01:15:48,447 --> 01:15:50,415
This is so not fair.

2012
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:51,984
Let's do arm wrestling.

2013
01:15:52,251 --> 01:15:54,086
- This won't count, - Okay.

2014
01:15:54,086 --> 01:15:56,088
- but let's do thigh wrestling. - Okay.

2015
01:15:56,255 --> 01:15:58,991
If those two face off, who will win?

2016
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:00,392
- I'm curious. - Right?

2017
01:16:00,392 --> 01:16:04,663
(Everybody is curious about Jong Kook versus Sung Bin.)

2018
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:06,832
- Who's going to play? - This won't count,

2019
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:09,168
so Team Curling doesn't have to play.

2020
01:16:09,201 --> 01:16:11,670
- Se Chan. - Okay.

2021
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:14,706
Sung Bin will play from this team.

2022
01:16:15,407 --> 01:16:17,409
- Look at his thighs. - I did long jump.

2023
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:19,278
- It's Jong Kook's turn then. - Okay.

2024
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:22,247
You didn't go,

2025
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:23,649
- so go ahead, Jae Seok. - Me?

2026
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,584
- He did the impression. - Okay.

2027
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:27,653
His thighs will be split.

2028
01:16:28,554 --> 01:16:31,156
- Please come up, Sung Bin. - Is he facing Jae Seok?

2029
01:16:32,224 --> 01:16:34,026
- Look at his thighs. - You never know.

2030
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:36,795
Compared to Jong Kook...

2031
01:16:36,795 --> 01:16:38,797
I think his are wider...

2032
01:16:38,864 --> 01:16:40,399
than Jong Kook's.

2033
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:43,535
(Everybody is focused on his thighs.)

2034
01:16:43,535 --> 01:16:50,475
(He trained with over 200kg of weight to strengthen his thighs.)

2035
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:57,349
(His thighs were made like steel through endurance.)

2036
01:16:57,349 --> 01:16:59,318
It looks like he's wearing winter pants.

2037
01:16:59,318 --> 01:17:00,919
It looks like cotton pants.

2038
01:17:00,986 --> 01:17:03,455
Isn't this too much of a difference?

2039
01:17:03,789 --> 01:17:05,991
You never know. You have to play first.

2040
01:17:05,991 --> 01:17:07,860
- They do look really different. - You have to try.

2041
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:09,862
- Ready. - I though these were his arms.

2042
01:17:10,395 --> 01:17:11,797
(Jae Seok's legs look even skinnier today.)

2043
01:17:11,797 --> 01:17:14,700
The camera is on top.

2044
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,535
- You never know. - You have to play first.

2045
01:17:16,535 --> 01:17:17,669
Set...

2046
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:19,638
(They only have 10 seconds.)

2047
01:17:19,638 --> 01:17:25,711
(It's game over once your legs split open or your knees touch.)

2048
01:17:25,711 --> 01:17:27,779
Set, go.

2049
01:17:28,113 --> 01:17:29,681
Jae Seok.

2050
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,385
Oh, dear.

2051
01:17:33,385 --> 01:17:37,089
(The reality is cruel.)

2052
01:17:37,089 --> 01:17:38,357
Did he play with you?

2053
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:41,860
(The unexpected result came in 2 seconds.)

2054
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:44,296
He was testing you out.

2055
01:17:44,296 --> 01:17:47,266
His thighs look strong. They do, right?

2056
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:50,168
Hold on. I think I can do this.

2057
01:17:50,235 --> 01:17:51,470
(He is filled with a gallant spirit.)

2058
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:52,738
Really? Try it.

2059
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:55,307
- I'll defend. - He's not weak.

2060
01:17:55,307 --> 01:17:57,109
Let me do this.

2061
01:17:57,109 --> 01:18:00,178
- Ready, set... - Let's go.

2062
01:18:00,178 --> 01:18:01,413
Set...

2063
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:02,881
(It's time for Jae Seok to close Sung Bin's legs.)

2064
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:05,150
(Jae Seok was confident.)

2065
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,752
(Will he withstand Sung Bin's attack?)

2066
01:18:06,752 --> 01:18:07,986
Start.

2067
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:10,689
He can do it.

2068
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:12,391
He's not using any force.

2069
01:18:14,826 --> 01:18:17,195
What is he doing?

2070
01:18:17,696 --> 01:18:20,599
(This is an automatic door.)

2071
01:18:20,599 --> 01:18:22,034
(He's miserable.)

2072
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,869
Jae Seok, you'll hurt yourself.

2073
01:18:25,304 --> 01:18:26,838
He's making fun of you.

2074
01:18:26,838 --> 01:18:29,608
Let go! Let go!

2075
01:18:29,775 --> 01:18:31,977
- Stand up! - Turn the cameras off!

2076
01:18:32,144 --> 01:18:34,179
This is a battle between Sung Bin and me!

2077
01:18:34,212 --> 01:18:36,581
Is this funny? Stop laughing!

2078
01:18:36,581 --> 01:18:37,616
(I'm sorry.)

2079
01:18:37,616 --> 01:18:39,217
Sung Bin, open your legs.

2080
01:18:39,217 --> 01:18:42,054
(Open sesame.)

2081
01:18:42,054 --> 01:18:44,823
Move over. This is embarrassing.

2082
01:18:44,823 --> 01:18:46,658
This is so embarrassing.

2083
01:18:46,892 --> 01:18:48,160
Move over.

2084
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,962
- Oh, dear. - Take him.

2085
01:18:49,962 --> 01:18:51,330
Take him out.

2086
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:52,497
Go, Se Chan.

2087
01:18:52,497 --> 01:18:54,466
Try, Se Chan.

2088
01:18:54,466 --> 01:18:56,068
His thighs are like rocks.

2089
01:18:56,068 --> 01:18:57,302
(Se Chan takes the mound after the female members cheer for him.)

2090
01:18:57,302 --> 01:18:58,704
I was supposed to face Jae Seok.

2091
01:18:58,704 --> 01:19:01,440
- Why would you carry this? - Just in case.

2092
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:03,542
(Spraying)

2093
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:05,077
Where are you spraying it?

2094
01:19:05,077 --> 01:19:07,279
- That was so random. - Where are you spraying?

2095
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:08,780
This is what you do.

2096
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,915
Why would you spray that?

2097
01:19:09,915 --> 01:19:11,883
It helps.

2098
01:19:11,883 --> 01:19:14,252
Oh, gosh.

2099
01:19:14,252 --> 01:19:17,289
- Why would you spray this? - It'll help.

2100
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:19,157
I faced Jong Kook before.

2101
01:19:19,157 --> 01:19:20,392
Try it.

2102
01:19:20,392 --> 01:19:21,927
Ready.

2103
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:23,829
Put a fist in between.

2104
01:19:24,162 --> 01:19:25,297
Ready.

2105
01:19:25,297 --> 01:19:27,232
(Why is there tension between these two?)

2106
01:19:28,033 --> 01:19:31,470
(He has thighs of a national-level athlete.)

2107
01:19:31,503 --> 01:19:35,140
(Jong Kook has the best thighs in Running Man.)

2108
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:39,011
(He trains them all year round.)

2109
01:19:39,011 --> 01:19:46,918
(He's going to write history again.)

2110
01:19:46,918 --> 01:19:49,755
When did you not work out?

2111
01:19:49,821 --> 01:19:50,989
Goodness.

2112
01:19:50,989 --> 01:19:53,658
- Se Chan's thighs are like rocks. - They are.

2113
01:19:53,725 --> 01:19:57,229
(Almost everybody knows.)

2114
01:19:57,229 --> 01:20:01,500
(He beats everybody he plays.)

2115
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,568
(Se Chan has rock thighs.)

2116
01:20:03,568 --> 01:20:07,939
(He's the new icon of power.)

2117
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,674
(What's the result of this match?)

2118
01:20:09,674 --> 01:20:11,009
- You have to exert force. - Okay.

2119
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,310
Set, go.

2120
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:14,746
- He's resisting it. - Set, go.

2121
01:20:14,746 --> 01:20:16,381
He's resisting it.

2122
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:18,150
- It'll end quickly. - His knees touched.

2123
01:20:18,817 --> 01:20:20,619
He's resisting it.

2124
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:21,686
(There's a sound.)

2125
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:22,988
- His knees touched. - Se Chan.

2126
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:25,457
Did you just fart?

2127
01:20:25,457 --> 01:20:27,059
No, I didn't.

2128
01:20:27,059 --> 01:20:28,460
- That was the spray. - I heard the sound.

2129
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,028
No, I'm just hungry.

2130
01:20:30,028 --> 01:20:32,998
You farted. Admit it and ask them to edit it out.

2131
01:20:32,998 --> 01:20:35,033
I farted.

2132
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:36,635
I did. So?

2133
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:38,170
That was a weak fart. Why?

2134
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:40,505
- "Weak fart". - I heard the sound.

2135
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:42,240
- That was a weak fart. - Switch.

2136
01:20:42,674 --> 01:20:44,843
This might change.

2137
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:47,379
Set, go.

2138
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:49,347
- Oh, dear. - Hey.

2139
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:50,382
Move your hands.

2140
01:20:50,382 --> 01:20:52,017
(Splitting)

2141
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:54,019
(Groaning)

2142
01:20:54,152 --> 01:20:56,188
(Are you okay, Se Chan?)

2143
01:20:56,188 --> 01:20:58,056
Move. Hey.

2144
01:20:58,056 --> 01:21:00,459
- Spray this for him. - Is this fun, Jong Kook?

2145
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:02,994
(Is this fun, Jong Kook?)

2146
01:21:02,994 --> 01:21:04,830
It's fun, right? You're playing with kids.

2147
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:05,931
No.

2148
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:08,834
You work out, so you play with people.

2149
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:10,869
Jong Kook and Sung Bin.

2150
01:21:10,869 --> 01:21:12,337
All right.

2151
01:21:12,337 --> 01:21:13,505
Let's do this.

2152
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:15,407
- This is the real match. - You don't know about this one.

2153
01:21:15,407 --> 01:21:17,576
But he's so strong. This won't work.

2154
01:21:17,576 --> 01:21:20,479
- We wanted to watch this. - Look at his legs.

2155
01:21:20,846 --> 01:21:22,080
Look at these two.

2156
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,015
This is worth watching.

2157
01:21:24,015 --> 01:21:25,217
(It's finally time.)

2158
01:21:25,884 --> 01:21:27,919
He's too strong.

2159
01:21:27,919 --> 01:21:29,421
- This won't work. - My gosh.

2160
01:21:29,421 --> 01:21:31,389
This is a big match.

2161
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:34,059
- His are much thicker. - They are.

2162
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:35,727
But he has some fat.

2163
01:21:35,727 --> 01:21:37,729
- That's true. - He has some fat.

2164
01:21:37,729 --> 01:21:39,831
I have no fat at all.

2165
01:21:39,831 --> 01:21:42,067
Meat like this tastes badly.

2166
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,704
(Meat like this tastes badly.)

2167
01:21:45,704 --> 01:21:46,705
I'm serious.

2168
01:21:46,705 --> 01:21:48,440
- There's no fat at all. - No.

2169
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:50,775
Legs like these are strong.

2170
01:21:50,775 --> 01:21:52,177
Ready.

2171
01:21:52,544 --> 01:21:53,778
Pay attention.

2172
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:55,280
- It's 10 seconds. - Right.

2173
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,848
I'm nervous for them.

2174
01:21:56,848 --> 01:21:59,518
- This is no joke. - Jong Kook never faced him.

2175
01:21:59,518 --> 01:22:00,752
- I know, right? - Oh, dear.

2176
01:22:00,752 --> 01:22:02,087
- Okay. - Set...

2177
01:22:02,087 --> 01:22:07,025
(The real trial of strength begins.)

2178
01:22:09,294 --> 01:22:10,862
I'm nervous for them.

2179
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,408
- This is no joke. - Jong Kook never faced him.

2180
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,760
- I know, right? - Oh, dear.

2181
01:22:14,766 --> 01:22:16,101
- Okay. - Set...

2182
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:21,039
(The real trial of strength begins.)

2183
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:22,741
(Sung Bin attacks first.)

2184
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:24,042
Go.

2185
01:22:24,476 --> 01:22:26,011
Look at Jong Kook.

2186
01:22:26,411 --> 01:22:29,014
He's shaking.

2187
01:22:29,014 --> 01:22:31,283
Jong Kook can't do it.

2188
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:36,121
(This is a tight match between their thighs.)

2189
01:22:36,288 --> 01:22:38,823
Jong Kook can't do it.

2190
01:22:39,591 --> 01:22:42,194
(Shaking)

2191
01:22:42,794 --> 01:22:44,596
He's shaking. Sung Bin is shaking too.

2192
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:46,331
Jong Kook can't do it.

2193
01:22:46,331 --> 01:22:47,532
(They're both flushed.)

2194
01:22:47,866 --> 01:22:49,034
Stop.

2195
01:22:49,034 --> 01:22:52,604
(Their strengths are similar, so the game ends.)

2196
01:22:52,971 --> 01:22:55,974
(The first match is a tie.)

2197
01:22:55,974 --> 01:22:58,176
You just have to attack now.

2198
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,644
- How was it? - He's so strong.

2199
01:22:59,644 --> 01:23:00,745
He's strong.

2200
01:23:00,745 --> 01:23:02,214
- He's so strong. - I've never seen...

2201
01:23:02,214 --> 01:23:04,349
Jong Kook's legs open this much.

2202
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:05,750
He's strong.

2203
01:23:07,452 --> 01:23:08,853
Hey!

2204
01:23:09,054 --> 01:23:10,422
(Hey!)

2205
01:23:10,422 --> 01:23:12,891
- You have to relax your muscles. - Stop it.

2206
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:14,492
- Stop it. - Hey!

2207
01:23:14,492 --> 01:23:16,161
You have to spray it.

2208
01:23:16,828 --> 01:23:18,163
- Why would you spray here? - Kwang Soo.

2209
01:23:18,163 --> 01:23:19,431
- Stop it. - You might hurt.

2210
01:23:19,431 --> 01:23:20,665
Wait, Kwang Soo.

2211
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:22,834
- My goodness. - Hold on.

2212
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:24,469
(Stop it, Kwang Soo.)

2213
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,439
- Are you out of your mind? - You can get hurt.

2214
01:23:27,439 --> 01:23:28,440
Ready...

2215
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:30,742
(It's Jong Kook's turn to attack.)

2216
01:23:30,742 --> 01:23:32,344
- This is incredible. - Don't get nervous.

2217
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:34,246
- Set... - He's strong.

2218
01:23:34,246 --> 01:23:36,314
- I'm curious about the outcome. - Hold on.

2219
01:23:36,314 --> 01:23:39,150
(They're more nervous than before.)

2220
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,453
Set, go.

2221
01:23:43,555 --> 01:23:46,057
(This is the last, thigh wrestling match.)

2222
01:23:46,057 --> 01:23:47,325
He can't close his legs.

2223
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:49,794
(They're shocked.)

2224
01:23:49,828 --> 01:23:52,831
(He tries his best.)

2225
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:56,701
(Frowning)

2226
01:23:57,369 --> 01:24:01,239
(This is a tight match that won't end easily.)

2227
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:03,241
(They're exclaiming...)

2228
01:24:03,241 --> 01:24:05,710
(in admiration.)

2229
01:24:06,177 --> 01:24:11,583
(Jong Kook's thighs are getting closer a tiny bit.)

2230
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:12,717
Stop.

2231
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:14,552
(Game over)

2232
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:15,954
Goodness.

2233
01:24:15,954 --> 01:24:17,555
(Jong Kook's thighs closed slightly near the end.)

2234
01:24:17,555 --> 01:24:18,623
Sung Bin won a little bit.

2235
01:24:18,623 --> 01:24:20,225
- That's right. - He won by a bit.

2236
01:24:20,225 --> 01:24:21,293
Jong Kook.

2237
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:22,861
- That's right. - He won by a bit.

2238
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:24,362
Sung Bin wins.

2239
01:24:24,362 --> 01:24:25,897
(Sung Bin wins in thigh wrestling.)

2240
01:24:25,897 --> 01:24:27,032
He's incredible.

2241
01:24:27,032 --> 01:24:28,466
- No wonder he got gold. - You were both cool.

2242
01:24:28,466 --> 01:24:29,768
- How was it? - That was so sexy.

2243
01:24:29,868 --> 01:24:31,636
I only watched him on TV,

2244
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:34,005
- and I finally got to play him. - How was it?

2245
01:24:34,005 --> 01:24:35,373
- Make this about me. - I applaud him.

2246
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:36,975
- Right? - I just want to applaud him.

2247
01:24:36,975 --> 01:24:39,611
- Thank you. - He's so strong.

2248
01:24:39,678 --> 01:24:41,880
Make this interview about me.

2249
01:24:42,213 --> 01:24:44,015
(What is he doing?)

2250
01:24:44,015 --> 01:24:45,350
What do you mean?

2251
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,718
After my match,

2252
01:24:46,718 --> 01:24:48,386
this could be the interview.

2253
01:24:48,987 --> 01:24:52,057
This?

2254
01:24:52,057 --> 01:24:53,124
It was just this.

2255
01:24:53,124 --> 01:24:54,192
This can go after the match.

2256
01:24:54,192 --> 01:24:56,394
I wasn't going to say this, but you were pitiful.

2257
01:24:56,394 --> 01:24:57,529
(I was going to hold back.)

2258
01:24:57,529 --> 01:25:00,398
- Stop it. - We'll edit it out for your kid.

2259
01:25:00,398 --> 01:25:02,133
My goodness.

2260
01:25:02,133 --> 01:25:03,335
(This is what Jae Seok wanted to show.)

2261
01:25:04,169 --> 01:25:06,805
(Thigh wrestling)

2262
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:08,039
Set, go.

2263
01:25:08,039 --> 01:25:10,108
(I came this far with my thin thighs.)

2264
01:25:10,108 --> 01:25:14,746
(History is made in thigh wrestling.)

2265
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:18,016
(I, Yu Jae Seok, did it.)

2266
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:20,251
(I bet you were surprised.)

2267
01:25:20,251 --> 01:25:21,953
(I only watched him on TV,)

2268
01:25:21,953 --> 01:25:23,922
(and I finally got to play him.)

2269
01:25:23,922 --> 01:25:25,390
(I applaud him.)

2270
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:27,559
(Thank you for the interview.)

2271
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,661
(Did you see that, son?)

2272
01:25:30,362 --> 01:25:33,098
That made Se Chan and me look so bad.

2273
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:36,134
Sung Bin has to thank me though. I made Jong Kook get weaker.

2274
01:25:36,134 --> 01:25:39,371
He kept on saying that. He said he made Jong Kook weaker.

2275
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:40,572
Stop it.

2276
01:25:40,972 --> 01:25:42,674
- Take good care of the elderly. - Okay.

2277
01:25:42,674 --> 01:25:43,742
(I feel bad about myself too.)

2278
01:25:43,742 --> 01:25:46,344
These two came after a long time,

2279
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:47,912
- but they have to leave now. - They do?

2280
01:25:47,912 --> 01:25:49,948
- It's too bad. - It is.

2281
01:25:49,948 --> 01:25:52,183
Next time...

2282
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:54,219
Do you want to see better celebrities next time?

2283
01:25:54,219 --> 01:25:55,754
(He's joking.)

2284
01:25:56,254 --> 01:25:58,490
I hope to perform well again and be invited to this show.

2285
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:59,858
I'll try my best.

2286
01:25:59,858 --> 01:26:02,360
(Sung Bin and Ji Soo, we had so much fun with you.)

2287
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:03,862
After the first mission,

2288
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:07,332
Ji Hyo won the Luxury Sticker.

2289
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:09,501
Sung Bin will hand out...

2290
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:12,504
the suitcase with her name on it.

2291
01:26:12,504 --> 01:26:14,606
- Suitcase? - What's that?

2292
01:26:14,606 --> 01:26:16,107
This? What is it?

2293
01:26:16,107 --> 01:26:18,910
(Congratulations, Ji Hyo.)

2294
01:26:19,477 --> 01:26:21,112
I'm so envious of her.

2295
01:26:21,946 --> 01:26:23,915
What? It's empty.

2296
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:25,083
(There's nothing.)

2297
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,551
- What? - There's nothing.

2298
01:26:27,118 --> 01:26:28,353
What?

2299
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:30,688
What? Did someone steal it?

2300
01:26:30,688 --> 01:26:32,624
(What? Someone stole it?)

2301
01:26:33,124 --> 01:26:35,794
(The Luxury Stickers got robbed?)

2302
01:26:35,794 --> 01:26:37,362
Did someone steal it again?

2303
01:26:37,529 --> 01:26:40,031
- What's that? - Do we get going?

2304
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:41,132
(There's a mysterious message for the Running Man members.)

2305
01:26:41,132 --> 01:26:42,767
- What? - What's this now?

2306
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:44,102
(There's a mysterious message for the Running Man members.)

2307
01:26:44,569 --> 01:26:46,604
(Scout List)

2308
01:26:46,604 --> 01:26:48,773
They won't give it to us so easily.

2309
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:54,045
(What list is this?)

2310
01:26:54,379 --> 01:26:55,980
What's this?

2311
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,950
(Some people are watching.)

2312
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:01,820
- There are 3 people. - 3 people?

2313
01:27:02,187 --> 01:27:04,923
(It's a message from three people.)

2314
01:27:04,923 --> 01:27:06,291
(Scout List)

2315
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,092
(Scoffing)

2316
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:09,427
Are you surprised?

2317
01:27:09,427 --> 01:27:13,331
You must have been excited about receiving the Luxury Stickers.

2318
01:27:13,832 --> 01:27:16,401
The stickers are in our hands.

2319
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:20,872
We are the coaches who got rejected when we tried to scout you...

2320
01:27:20,872 --> 01:27:24,509
for aerobic exercise club. We are currently among you.

2321
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:26,511
(We are currently among you.)

2322
01:27:27,378 --> 01:27:29,881
The coaches are among us.

2323
01:27:29,881 --> 01:27:32,283
(Are the 3 coaches among us?)

2324
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:36,321
We came here today...

2325
01:27:36,387 --> 01:27:39,657
to eliminate the gold medalist who is hiding among you...

2326
01:27:39,657 --> 01:27:42,260
and overcome a blow to our egos.

2327
01:27:43,094 --> 01:27:46,865
(Are the 3 coaches aiming for a gold medalist?)

2328
01:27:47,565 --> 01:27:51,336
If we find the gold medalist first,

2329
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,706
your names will be on the Shuddering Package.

2330
01:27:56,674 --> 01:27:59,744
If you find us first,

2331
01:28:00,044 --> 01:28:02,847
we will put our names on it.

2332
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:08,119
- Shall we begin the real race? - Shall we begin the real race?

2333
01:28:08,786 --> 01:28:15,793
(Laughing)

2334
01:28:16,294 --> 01:28:18,897
- There are three coaches, right? - We must catch them.

2335
01:28:18,897 --> 01:28:24,135
(The three coaches who are in hiding sent them a video message.)

2336
01:28:24,135 --> 01:28:27,505
(Who are the 3 coaches?)

2337
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:30,108
- Those are Kwang Soo's fingers. - Those are your fingers.

2338
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:32,377
(Those are Kwang Soo's fingers.)

2339
01:28:32,377 --> 01:28:35,079
- It's Kwang Soo. - No one else has such long fingers.

2340
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,149
- You... - Why are you ganging up on me?

2341
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:39,551
- It's you. - For goodness' sake.

2342
01:28:39,551 --> 01:28:40,952
It's not me!

2343
01:28:40,952 --> 01:28:43,688
It's not me! It's not me!

2344
01:28:43,688 --> 01:28:44,923
It's not me! Is it you?

2345
01:28:44,923 --> 01:28:46,424
- It's not me. - It's you, right?

2346
01:28:46,424 --> 01:28:47,425
Don't be ridiculous.

2347
01:28:47,425 --> 01:28:48,593
- Look. - It's not me!

2348
01:28:48,593 --> 01:28:50,595
- I caught a coach. - We are done.

2349
01:28:50,595 --> 01:28:52,597
- What are you talking about? - We caught the three of them.

2350
01:28:52,597 --> 01:28:53,798
Why are you catching people already?

2351
01:28:53,798 --> 01:28:55,733
They're Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Da Hee.

2352
01:28:55,733 --> 01:28:57,135
- Da Hee. - I am not a coach.

2353
01:28:57,135 --> 01:28:58,136
- We caught them. - I am not a coach.

2354
01:28:58,136 --> 01:28:59,871
- They are the coaches. - I swear I am not a coach.

2355
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:01,005
They are the coaches.

2356
01:29:01,005 --> 01:29:03,641
(Who are the 3 coaches and the gold medalist?)

2357
01:29:03,708 --> 01:29:06,744
(Are there coaches among us?)

2358
01:29:06,744 --> 01:29:09,681
(Who are the coaches?)

2359
01:29:09,681 --> 01:29:12,917
(You can't trust anyone.)

2360
01:29:13,184 --> 01:29:15,420
(Don't let them deceive you.)

2361
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,088
(However)

2362
01:29:17,088 --> 01:29:19,123
(Did someone take these pictures in secret?)

2363
01:29:19,123 --> 01:29:21,125
(People are eliminated.)

2364
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:23,094
(You disappear when you get your picture taken.)

2365
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:25,163
(Do you want to live?)

2366
01:29:25,163 --> 01:29:27,031
(Suspicious figures...)

2367
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:29,267
(watch the athletes.)

2368
01:29:29,267 --> 01:29:31,903
(There are coaches among us.)

2369
01:29:32,804 --> 01:29:34,505
(To survive,)

2370
01:29:34,505 --> 01:29:37,442
(they must identify the coaches before sunrise.)

2371
01:29:37,442 --> 01:29:39,243
(Coaches in hiding...)

2372
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:41,846
(versus the athletes who must find them)

2373
01:29:41,846 --> 01:29:43,081
- Who are they? - You are a coach.

2374
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:45,083
(Who will be the winners of this mysterious match?)

2375
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:46,751
(Don't get your picture taken.)

2376
