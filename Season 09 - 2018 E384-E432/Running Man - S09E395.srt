1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,747
(Last week)

2
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:14,150
(Team Bobsleigh, fast-chasers on the ice)

3
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,920
(Team Curling, Ms. Glasses and her cool gang)

4
00:00:17,454 --> 00:00:20,023
(Team Gateball, life starts at the age of 50.)

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,660
(Soohorang and the human-faced bird, mascots of Pyeongchang Olympics)

6
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:26,496
(And the impressive guests were invited.)

7
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:29,266
(Kim Ji Soo and Yun Sung Bin from Team Skeleton)

8
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:32,102
(They thrived on the ice, and last week, on the show.)

9
00:00:32,569 --> 00:00:35,839
(They're the strongest pair. Is there anything they can't do?)

10
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:37,774
Can a national athlete do that?

11
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:41,044
(They were exceptionally witty too.)

12
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:43,780
(Sung Bin and Ji Soo ruled Running Man.)

13
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:47,010
You joined us today for a brief moment today. How was it today?

14
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,452
- I laughed a lot. My cheeks hurt. - Really?

15
00:00:49,452 --> 00:00:51,421
- My gosh. - Stay for the whole show next time.

16
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,858
Yes, stay for long just like his face.

17
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:56,359
"Just like his face"?

18
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,094
- Only my side hair is long. - It's so long.

19
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:59,562
- It's long. - It looks longer than usual today.

20
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:01,331
After the first mission,

21
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:04,768
Ji Hyo won the Luxury Sticker.

22
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:09,939
Sung Bin will hand out the briefcase with her name on it.

23
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:11,775
- Briefcase? - What's that?

24
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:13,443
This? What is it?

25
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:16,112
(Congratulations, Ji Hyo.)

26
00:01:17,013 --> 00:01:19,449
- I'm so envious of her. - Is that it?

27
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:21,251
What? It's empty.

28
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:22,819
(There's nothing.)

29
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,987
There's nothing inside.

30
00:01:24,688 --> 00:01:25,855
What?

31
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:28,058
What? Did someone steal it?

32
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:29,859
(What? Someone stole it?)

33
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,063
(The Luxury Stickers got robbed?)

34
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,431
- Did someone steal it again? - It's empty.

35
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:36,299
- What? - What was that?

36
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:37,334
Do we need to get going?

37
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,535
(There's a mysterious message.)

38
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,236
- What? - What's this now?

39
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:41,538
There's a list.

40
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:43,907
(Scout List)

41
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,542
- They won't make it easy for us. - What is this?

42
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,676
Kwang Soo!

43
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,381
(Why is this list thrown at the members out of nowhere?)

44
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:53,149
What's this?

45
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:56,219
(Some people are watching.)

46
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,888
- There are 3 people. - 3 people?

47
00:01:59,723 --> 00:02:02,125
(It's a message from three people.)

48
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,628
(Scoffing)

49
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:06,830
Are you surprised?

50
00:02:06,896 --> 00:02:10,734
You must have been excited about receiving the Luxury Stickers.

51
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,703
The stickers are in our hands.

52
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:18,341
We are the coaches who got rejected when we tried to scout you...

53
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:21,911
for aerobic exercise club. We are currently among you.

54
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,880
(We are currently among you.)

55
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:26,049
They're among us.

56
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:27,617
The coaches are here.

57
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:30,186
(Are the 3 coaches among us?)

58
00:02:31,788 --> 00:02:34,023
We came here today...

59
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:37,460
to eliminate the gold medalist who is hiding among you...

60
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,996
and overcome a blow to our egos.

61
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,667
(Are the 3 coaches targeting the gold medalist?)

62
00:02:45,535 --> 00:02:49,105
If we find the gold medalist first,

63
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:52,242
your names will be listed for the Shuddering Package.

64
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,877
(The losers' names will be listed for the Shuddering Package.)

65
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,514
However, if you find us first,

66
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:00,683
we will list our names for the package.

67
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:05,889
- Shall we begin the real race? - Shall we begin the real race?

68
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:13,830
(Laughing)

69
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:15,632
- There are 3 coaches? - Yes, 3 coaches.

70
00:03:15,632 --> 00:03:16,633
Let's find them.

71
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:20,336
(The three hidden coaches have sent them a video message.)

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,907
(Who are the three coaches that are among us?)

73
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:25,975
This is the Family Package Part 2,

74
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:28,511
and we're about to start today's actual race.

75
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,914
The 36th Olympic of Running Man,

76
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,483
The Sticker That Disappeared.

77
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:35,185
(The 36th Olympic of Running Man, The Sticker That Disappeared)

78
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:38,488
Among you, there are three coaches that are holding a grudge...

79
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:41,224
against the players that have turned them down.

80
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:44,994
And there's also one gold medalist that they're hoping to find.

81
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:48,998
If the gold medalist gets caught during the final race,

82
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,500
the victory will go to the coaches.

83
00:03:50,967 --> 00:03:54,737
Their names will go up on the Luxury Package slot.

84
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,639
And six players out of the group...

85
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,642
will have their names put up on the Shuddering Package slot.

86
00:04:00,143 --> 00:04:01,311
On the other hand,

87
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:05,381
if the players and the gold medalist succeed...

88
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,050
in finding the three coaches,

89
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,618
the victory will go to the players.

90
00:04:08,618 --> 00:04:12,822
Thus, the three coaches will end up on the Shuddering Package slot.

91
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:15,558
Each member who wins a round will be given a clue...

92
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,629
about who the coaches and the gold medalist could be.

93
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:21,097
(The winner of each round will be given clues.)

94
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,733
The players have the upper hand since there are only three coaches.

95
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:24,868
And you're one of the coaches.

96
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:26,002
- Exactly. - You're one of them.

97
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:27,570
You and Da Hee are one of them.

98
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,571
- It's you and Da Hee. - It's not me.

99
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:29,939
I get accused every episode, but it's really not me.

100
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:30,974
Wait until they give you a clue.

101
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,309
- Don't you all think he's weird? - Yes, he's weird.

102
00:04:33,309 --> 00:04:34,844
It's because of my outfit.

103
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,479
It's really not me.

104
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,615
First of all,

105
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:41,117
Ji Hyo won the first mission.

106
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,886
So instead of giving her a stolen sticker,

107
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:46,089
she'll be getting a clue about the coaches.

108
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,690
Steal it!

109
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:49,993
(Running)

110
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,494
Steal it!

111
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:53,162
What are you doing?

112
00:04:53,263 --> 00:04:54,697
- I was going to check for you. - It's okay.

113
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,299
But she might be the coach.

114
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,301
Yes, she might be the coach.

115
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,270
(Ji Hyo herself might actually be the coach.)

116
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,877
(The three coaches all have different last names.)

117
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:11,180
The first clue always points out at everyone.

118
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:13,149
(Lee Da Hee, Lee Sang Yeob, Lee Kwang Soo)

119
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,884
(These three people can't all be coaches.)

120
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:17,153
- Let's move onto the next mission. - Let's go.

121
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:19,889
Let's go. Let's go.

122
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:22,158
- This is insane. - Come to think of it,

123
00:05:22,158 --> 00:05:23,726
I think they're all women.

124
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,828
- The gold medalist is a woman. - That's possible.

125
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:27,830
- The gold medalist is a woman. - The three evil women.

126
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,799
- And the coaches are women too. - Right. Because if that's the case,

127
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,367
- I think I'm right. - the clues will be hard to get.

128
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,836
- No. - It could actually be Seok Jin.

129
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,138
It's Seok Jin.

130
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:36,139
I'm not a coach.

131
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,674
- Really? Are you sure? - Yes.

132
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,208
Then it could be the remaining four.

133
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:42,178
(Then it could be the remaining four women.)

134
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:43,680
He's so sharp.

135
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,848
(That was sharp, wasn't it?)

136
00:05:45,848 --> 00:05:47,283
There are 3 coaches, not 4.

137
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,052
- 3 coaches. - 3 coaches and 1 gold medalist.

138
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,887
Seok Jin doesn't really know what's going on.

139
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,756
Wait. What's going on? Tell me.

140
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,592
- My gosh. - I don't get it.

141
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,294
Maybe Seok Jin's a bronze medalist.

142
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:01,564
(Seok Jin could be a bronze medalist without anyone's knowing.)

143
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,266
- A bronze medalist? - He makes things up.

144
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,569
You'll all be able to get a clue about the coaches...

145
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:09,939
through the mission we're about to do now.

146
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:12,041
It's Talk Backwards.

147
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,977
(Talk Backwards)

148
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,378
- "Talk Backwards"? - What's this?

149
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:17,580
After you listen to a word I say, you all need to take turns...

150
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,349
and say each letter of the word backwards.

151
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:21,117
I'll start with a word that has three syllables,

152
00:06:21,284 --> 00:06:24,954
and it'll go up to seven syllables. If you all succeed,

153
00:06:24,954 --> 00:06:26,856
you'll all be given a clue about the coaches.

154
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:28,658
That's too hard.

155
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,227
For example, if I say, "Yu Jae Seok".

156
00:06:31,227 --> 00:06:33,062
- Seok, Jae, Yu. - Seok, Jae, Yu.

157
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:36,499
Then I'll move onto the next word. For example, "Please do not park."

158
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:39,702
- Park, Not, Do, Please. - Park, Not, Do, Please.

159
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:40,770
It's so hard.

160
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,672
And if I say, "Team that scouts talented people".

161
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,841
You'll have to say "People, Talented, Scouts, That, Team".

162
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,309
- It's so hard. - It's so difficult.

163
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:48,277
This is so similar to the other group game we played.

164
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,679
- You're right. - Okay.

165
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,081
- We only have to do it once. - It starts here.

166
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,816
- It's just once. - And it moves onto here.

167
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:56,152
But wait a minute. Think about this, Sang Yeob.

168
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,588
They're giving us a clue about the coaches.

169
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,823
That means the coaches won't want this game to succeed.

170
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,359
- The coaches will try to ruin it. - Exactly.

171
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,895
- The coaches will get in the way. - They'll get it wrong.

172
00:07:05,895 --> 00:07:07,296
The coaches will purposely make a mistake.

173
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:09,065
We need to doubt the person that makes a mistake.

174
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:10,900
- That person is the coach. - The overall race is important,

175
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,001
but we need to pay attention right now.

176
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:14,604
Ji Hyo, you can do it properly this time.

177
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:15,672
Da Hee.

178
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:17,340
Don't wear your hat if your scalp itches.

179
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,409
(Just take your hat off if your scalp itches.)

180
00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:21,878
- My gosh, stop scratching. - Da Hee.

181
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,746
- Wash your hair. - Da Hee.

182
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,214
It's okay. You don't need to wear it.

183
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:27,083
I guess her scalp was really itchy.

184
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,584
Yes, she was scratching like this.

185
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:32,655
But your hair probably doesn't smell as bad as So Min's.

186
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,824
- My hair smells nice. - Does it smell?

187
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:38,327
- It doesn't smell, right? - No, it doesn't.

188
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,229
- What about mine? - They're both...

189
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,966
- They're both smelling their hair. - What?

190
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,868
Hey, don't lie. I washed my hair.

191
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:48,371
Turn around, and smell Jin Young's.

192
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:49,806
Mine?

193
00:07:52,608 --> 00:07:54,711
(Gosh, my nose!)

194
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,946
Hey, So Min. So Min.

195
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,314
Come over here.

196
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,582
Your hair smells too.

197
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,850
You smell too.

198
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:03,653
- You should smell her hair. - Smell it.

199
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:04,987
- Jin Young. - Do you want to?

200
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:06,089
Smell Jin Young's hair.

201
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,224
I'll be really objective and see if it smells or not.

202
00:08:08,224 --> 00:08:09,525
I'm so upset.

203
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:12,195
I washed my hair.

204
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,199
(Surprised)

205
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:18,801
- Does it smell? - It must smell really bad.

206
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:20,536
- Jin Young. - Is it as bad as So Min's?

207
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:22,004
- This is... - Let me try.

208
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:23,239
Jin Young, your hair...

209
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:25,108
smells...

210
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:27,276
really unpleasant.

211
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:28,678
- Wait. - What's wrong?

212
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:30,813
- Yes, that's right. I'm serious. - Let me try.

213
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,315
- You... - I'll really be honest.

214
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:34,350
- Don't overreact. - Okay.

215
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,385
- I'll be really honest. - Does it really smell?

216
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:38,955
(Angry)

217
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:41,157
Really?

218
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:43,025
- We're not lying. - Really?

219
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,094
- It's really serious. - I really washed my hair.

220
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,629
It smells like...

221
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:49,966
the old real estate agency that used to be in my neighborhood.

222
00:08:49,966 --> 00:08:51,534
(It reminds him of the real estate agency from his childhood.)

223
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,703
- I'm being serious. It really does. - He's not lying.

224
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,639
Do you understand why I said it smells a little unpleasant?

225
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,740
(The national tours gifted her with the smell of the countryside.)

226
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,375
- Seriously. - You should smell it.

227
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,877
- Me? - You smell it.

228
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,712
I'm not really sensitive when it comes to smells.

229
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,448
If he says it smells, it'll be the truth. Does it smell?

230
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,583
- It doesn't smell, right? - I'm not sensitive with smells.

231
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,651
He's so cool.

232
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:11,220
(I'm not sensitive with smells.)

233
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,658
(I don't care what they say. Your hair doesn't smell to me.)

234
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:19,695
- My gosh. - He's so considerate.

235
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:22,031
- Stop lying. - Your nose is bleeding.

236
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,167
(Jong Kook, your nose is bleeding.)

237
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,502
(They can't stand him being sweet.)

238
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:28,070
He probably held his breath.

239
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,772
He must not have smelled it.

240
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,641
What is this?

241
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,943
Are you trying to show your affection for her?

242
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:36,312
- I'm so sick of this. - I'm really not sensitive.

243
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,314
My gosh, I'm sick of this whole affection thing.

244
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:41,450
Jin Young will start, and it'll carry on...

245
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,353
by going in a zigzag until the last line.

246
00:09:44,353 --> 00:09:46,088
- I can't get it wrong. - We can do this.

247
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:47,590
Let's start.

248
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,891
- Finale. - Le.

249
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,259
- Na. - Fi.

250
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,961
- Blow a whistle. - Whistle.

251
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:53,729
- A - Blow.

252
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:54,764
Let's eat omu-rice.

253
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,265
- Rice. - Omu.

254
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,535
(Incorrect)

255
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,537
(It's his turn, but he didn't say anything.)

256
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:03,072
- Kwang Soo, why are you quiet? - It's your turn.

257
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:05,942
- You're being weird. - No, it was supposed to...

258
00:10:05,942 --> 00:10:08,244
- It's obviously this way. - It's this way.

259
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:10,112
- He's a coach. - You're a coach.

260
00:10:10,112 --> 00:10:11,547
- Seriously. - I'm not a coach.

261
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,416
- You're being too obvious. - It's not me.

262
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:15,084
- Haha, you know it's not me, right? - Unbelievable.

263
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,053
You know it's not because I'm a coach, right?

264
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:18,521
This is so wrong.

265
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:20,156
- I can't believe this. - This is not the way to go.

266
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:21,791
Should we start with Haha and go this way?

267
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,025
Then let's start with Haha.

268
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,927
- Then it'll go this way. - It'll go this way...

269
00:10:24,927 --> 00:10:26,996
and come down to Jong Kook and continue on.

270
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,898
Get ready.

271
00:10:29,232 --> 00:10:31,200
Let's begin.

272
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,668
- Watercress. - Cress.

273
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:33,736
- Ter. - Wa.

274
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:34,904
Water strider.

275
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:35,972
- Der. - Stri.

276
00:10:35,972 --> 00:10:37,006
- Ter. - Wa.

277
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,107
The Battery of Love.

278
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,775
- Love. - Of.

279
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:41,677
Ry.

280
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:43,312
Of.

281
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:47,116
- No, it's "Ry". Come on. - What?

282
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:48,384
Hey, you.

283
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,652
Are you a coach?

284
00:10:49,752 --> 00:10:51,053
- No. - You...

285
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:52,989
- Listen. "The Battery of Love". - I know.

286
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:54,257
You should've said, "Ry".

287
00:10:54,257 --> 00:10:55,791
You got it wrong.

288
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:58,094
Da Hee's mad again. Look at her all angry.

289
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,062
Then why don't you try it? Say it backwards.

290
00:11:00,062 --> 00:11:03,199
Love, Of, Ry, Ter, Bat, The.

291
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:04,567
Was that so hard to do?

292
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:06,802
(So Min, was that so hard?)

293
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,137
- Why are you angry? - No.

294
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:11,908
(Da Hee's desire to win the game made her explode.)

295
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:13,175
Tell her you're too old.

296
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:15,811
If my mom was like this, I might actually die.

297
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:18,347
That would be so funny.

298
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:19,615
(A shouting mother that's obsessed about winning)

299
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:20,783
- I know. Think about it. - My gosh.

300
00:11:20,783 --> 00:11:22,184
If So Min was your girlfriend...

301
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:24,520
and your mom was Da Hee, that would be a disaster.

302
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,455
If she was my mom, I really could've died.

303
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:27,757
- No one will be on your side. - I'll be discarded in no time.

304
00:11:27,757 --> 00:11:29,692
And what if you're the dad?

305
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:32,995
(What if you're the dad, Jong Kook?)

306
00:11:33,462 --> 00:11:35,331
(It's funny just by imagining them as a family.)

307
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:37,500
(A girlfriend that's full of suspicion)

308
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,535
(A mom who's obsessed about winning)

309
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:43,105
(A Spartan dad)

310
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,141
(My goodness.)

311
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:46,475
How terrible.

312
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:50,146
This is your last chance.

313
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,148
- We'll start with Jin Young. - Okay.

314
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:53,616
It's our last chance.

315
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:55,217
Come on. Let's do it properly.

316
00:11:55,217 --> 00:11:56,218
Come on, guys.

317
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,954
We need a clue about the coaches.

318
00:11:57,954 --> 00:11:59,021
Get ready.

319
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:01,157
Let's begin.

320
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:02,325
Ear syringe.

321
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,060
- Ringe. - Sy.

322
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:05,528
Ringe.

323
00:12:05,661 --> 00:12:07,396
(Incorrect)

324
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:08,698
Ringe.

325
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:11,600
(That's not what the word was.)

326
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,503
Da Hee, how can you get it wrong? It only had three syllables.

327
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:16,672
(How can you get it wrong when it only had three syllables?)

328
00:12:16,672 --> 00:12:18,240
(Embarrassed)

329
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:21,344
- How could you get it wrong? - No, that's not it.

330
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,980
Jin Young already said, "Ringe". How could you say it again?

331
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,681
It's because she's a coach.

332
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:26,782
- Do you think so? - She's a coach.

333
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:28,484
She's Coach Lee. I know who she is now.

334
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,253
- Let's try just 1 more time. - Give us 1 more chance.

335
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:32,989
- This is really the end. - Okay.

336
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,256
- If anyone gets it wrong, - That means...

337
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,125
- that person is really the coach. - he or she is the coach.

338
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,727
- No doubt. - Let's start with Jin Young.

339
00:12:37,727 --> 00:12:40,229
I made myself clear. Whoever gets it wrong this time is the coach.

340
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,364
Let's begin.

341
00:12:41,364 --> 00:12:43,065
- Work and life. - Life.

342
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,300
- And. - Work.

343
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,335
- Labyrinth of fear. - Fear.

344
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,037
(Hesitant)

345
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:49,405
- Of. - He's a coach, right?

346
00:12:49,405 --> 00:12:50,639
No, I'm not.

347
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,975
You said it way too late.

348
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:56,212
Jae Seok must be a coach.

349
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:57,480
- You're right. - My gosh.

350
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,348
(They're doubting him for nitpicking at Seok Jin.)

351
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:00,683
Oh, my gosh.

352
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:02,952
- He's right, isn't he? - He did that on purpose.

353
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:05,054
- So Min, I'm... - He was quick to judge.

354
00:13:05,054 --> 00:13:06,589
If he answers incorrectly,

355
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,691
- he gets caught. - You know I'm not, right?

356
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:11,527
I expected it from him as soon as the game started.

357
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:13,996
- I knew it. - Come on.

358
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:16,632
- That's right. - He's a coach after all.

359
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,934
- Jong Kook. - Long time no see.

360
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,569
Long time no see.

361
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,472
- This is unbelievable. - He returned as a coach.

362
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,608
- It's time that you were a coach. - That's right.

363
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:29,345
I won't be giving you a hint.

364
00:13:29,345 --> 00:13:31,747
- Give us a chance. - Give us one more chance.

365
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:33,616
- 1 more time, please. - Let's play 1 more game.

366
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:35,284
As the last game,

367
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:38,220
will you play Subtract Multiplication or Song Ji Hyo Game?

368
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,122
- Song Ji Hyo Game. - What's that?

369
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:43,492
If I say, "river", make a word such as "river port".

370
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:45,127
- Let's play Song Ji Hyo Game. - Three-syllable word?

371
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,295
- This is difficult. - Song Ji Hyo Game?

372
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:49,932
- Let's play it in this order. - Okay.

373
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,867
- Get ready. - Three syllables?

374
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,235
Make a three-syllable word.

375
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,971
Get ready, set, go. Dog.

376
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,006
Bird.

377
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,974
(Dog bird)

378
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,309
- What? - Dog.

379
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,244
(She says a curse word unconsciously.)

380
00:14:02,244 --> 00:14:04,580
- What? - My goodness.

381
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,515
I'm sorry. What is it?

382
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,784
- I'm sorry. - How could you?

383
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,352
- Jin Young. - I'm sorry.

384
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,221
How could you say that?

385
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:13,956
- Jin Young. - You're the boss.

386
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,925
Shall I complete the curse word?

387
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,061
- So Min. - How about "kki"?

388
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,430
- Stop it. - I'll say "kki".

389
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:24,366
You could say, "Is anyone there?"

390
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,069
- How about "Is anyone there?" - "Ridgeback prawn" is possible.

391
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:31,774
- It's a shrimp that's like a dog. - "Ridgeback prawn"?

392
00:14:31,774 --> 00:14:33,342
It's called ridgeback prawn.

393
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,643
(They're trying too hard.)

394
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:35,978
You're amazing.

395
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:38,948
Song Ji Hyo Game requires you to think...

396
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,616
in a short period of time.

397
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:42,918
You say words that you use often without realizing it.

398
00:14:42,918 --> 00:14:44,954
(You say words that you use often without realizing it.)

399
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,856
- It shows how you've lived. - Seriously.

400
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,924
- No. - Be careful.

401
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:51,293
- "Dog bird". - I was in a rush.

402
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:54,730
The hint on the coach will not be given.

403
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,067
- Do the coaches know each other? - Yes.

404
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,702
Then they can help each other out.

405
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:00,870
What's this?

406
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,204
(There's something.)

407
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:03,472
- Really? - Yes.

408
00:15:03,606 --> 00:15:05,307
- What's the cushion for? - It's so funny.

409
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:07,476
Is it for one person again?

410
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:09,512
Why is there a cushion?

411
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:13,849
- It's called Catch the Tail Quiz. - Catch the Tail Quiz?

412
00:15:13,849 --> 00:15:15,451
(Catch the Tail Quiz)

413
00:15:15,751 --> 00:15:17,086
Catch the Tail Quiz?

414
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,921
- Choose members of your choice. - Catch the Tail?

415
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,022
(What is Catch the Tail Quiz?)

416
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:23,893
Make a team of four with members of your choice.

417
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:28,597
(To make a team of his choice,)

418
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:31,066
(he wants to be on Jong Kook's team.)

419
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:32,935
(He makes a move.)

420
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,069
Catch the Tail.

421
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,738
It's connected to the previous team.

422
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:39,375
- Go away, Jae Seok. - Why are you coming?

423
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,743
- Why? - It's embarrassing.

424
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,178
I want to play with Jong Kook.

425
00:15:42,178 --> 00:15:44,079
Rules aren't important.

426
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,815
- Wait. - Stay out, coach.

427
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:47,983
Stay out, coach.

428
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,152
(He keeps a distance.)

429
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:51,620
- Where will you go? - Listen.

430
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,290
- Do you know what makes me angry? - What?

431
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,492
There's always So Min lurking around.

432
00:15:56,492 --> 00:15:58,194
What? Go away, So Min.

433
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:00,496
- Look at her. - We're his children.

434
00:16:00,496 --> 00:16:04,133
Pop the balloon. You'll find a question inside.

435
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:06,969
The team that puts the question on the sitting cushion first...

436
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,904
- can answer it. - That sounds fun.

437
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,239
- Let's go, team. - Let's go.

438
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,808
Each member of the team guesses a syllable.

439
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,443
The first team to answer wins.

440
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:16,745
The winning team gets a hint about the coaches.

441
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,747
If no team answers correctly, there won't be any hints.

442
00:16:18,747 --> 00:16:22,117
Let's determine the teams with the spoons.

443
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:24,753
- Teams? - Let's do it randomly.

444
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,556
Do you see the colors on the spoons?

445
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:28,657
(The ones with the same color become a team.)

446
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:31,293
- Let me be on Jong Kook's team. - It's random.

447
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:34,263
Jong Kook will pick last.

448
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:35,331
(He's worried about competition.)

449
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:37,466
- You pick last. - Okay.

450
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,069
I wish I could be in his position.

451
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,403
- At the top? - Just once.

452
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,938
- You can't. - Where everyone wants me.

453
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:45,674
Let's start with Ji Hyo. Pick one.

454
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:48,244
- Mine is green. - Green.

455
00:16:48,244 --> 00:16:49,511
- It's not bad. - Okay.

456
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,014
- It's red. - That's not bad.

457
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:53,549
- Blue. - Blue isn't bad.

458
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:55,718
We have three teams.

459
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,553
The rest will overlap.

460
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,188
- Does it start now? - Yes.

461
00:16:59,188 --> 00:17:01,156
Everyone wants to be on Jong Kook's team.

462
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:03,092
(They hope for Jong Kook.)

463
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:04,660
(That's needless to say.)

464
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,262
- All of us want him. - It's one person.

465
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:07,930
- Please. - Let it be me.

466
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,833
It doesn't matter which team Da Hee, Ji Hyo, and Han Na are on.

467
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,601
- It doesn't matter. - Please.

468
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:14,403
I hope everyone else is on other teams.

469
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,338
- It starts now. - Which team is Jin Young on?

470
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,706
Don't we know the results later?

471
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:20,576
- There is one man - I haven't picked yet.

472
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:23,279
- It's blue. - It's blue.

473
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:24,546
It's blue.

474
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,382
- Whose team is she on? - It's Han Na.

475
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,850
Is it Da Hee?

476
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,652
(How about Sang Yeob?)

477
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:31,487
Mine is blue too. Who's team is blue?

478
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:32,521
Come here and join us.

479
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,189
- In this case... - We need one more person.

480
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,824
One more person will join.

481
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:37,359
- Someone should pick blue. - That's right.

482
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,594
- You only get one more member. - Pick blue.

483
00:17:38,594 --> 00:17:40,929
- Seok Jin, pick the blue spoon. - Get rid of it.

484
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,097
What if he picks the blue one?

485
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:44,600
- No. - No way.

486
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,202
- Blue, blue - Blue, blue

487
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,972
- Don't pick blue - If he picks the blue one,

488
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:51,774
your team is complete.

489
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:55,277
The one who picks the blue one.

490
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:59,014
- Let's go. It's green. - It's green.

491
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:02,951
Why did you pick it? I don't want you.

492
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:06,088
- Come on, Seok Jin. - Just accept it.

493
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,723
Jong Kook will join us.

494
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,291
Even if I join, it'll be difficult.

495
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:11,293
Seok Jin will make it hard.

496
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,796
- Please. - We're doomed.

497
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,331
- It'll be blue. - It's red.

498
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,832
He's with Da Hee.

499
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,033
(Kwang Soo joins Da Hee.)

500
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,837
(Are you red too?)

501
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,739
What? Da Hee.

502
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:25,574
- Am I that bad? - No.

503
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:27,710
- I'm not that bad, am I? - I'm happy.

504
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,545
- Seriously. - It's great.

505
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,713
Pick the blue one.

506
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:32,281
- Pick the blue. - Go on.

507
00:18:33,182 --> 00:18:35,617
- Please pick the blue one. - Please pick it.

508
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:38,654
- Please pick the blue one. - Pick the blue one.

509
00:18:38,654 --> 00:18:40,122
- No way. - Pick the blue one.

510
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,290
- Let's go. - Please.

511
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,324
Please pick it.

512
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,325
- Come on. - Let's go.

513
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:47,429
(Se Chan joins Team Blue.)

514
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:49,365
(Team Blue is complete.)

515
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:50,733
Yes.

516
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,735
- It's okay. - Kim Jong Kook.

517
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,370
Let's go.

518
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,571
That's upsetting.

519
00:18:55,571 --> 00:18:58,140
Play with me and Kwang Soo.

520
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,110
Kim Jong Kook, Kim Jong Kook

521
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,945
Pick a green one, Jong Kook.

522
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,414
So Min is the worst player.

523
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:07,282
Pick a green spoon, So Min.

524
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,184
- Don't pick a green one. - Join Team Red.

525
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:11,854
- Pick a red spoon, So Min. - Next is So Min.

526
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,055
Please.

527
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:14,289
- She picked it. - She got one.

528
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,758
(Which team will So Min join?)

529
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:16,759
Is it green?

530
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,260
(So Min joins Team Green.)

531
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,596
- That's good. - Good job.

532
00:19:20,896 --> 00:19:23,999
(We're doomed.)

533
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:25,701
She really picked green.

534
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:30,005
(Green spoons are thrown to the ground.)

535
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,708
- My goodness. It's unbelievable. - That's right.

536
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:34,543
- It's the worst. - Team Green is the worst.

537
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:36,945
Even Jong Kook can't save Team Green.

538
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,581
- Hey. - Jae Seok belongs to green.

539
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:41,950
- If I join Team Green... - Seriously.

540
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,586
- It'd be bad. Seriously. - I refuse.

541
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:45,954
- I can't join Team Green. - Please.

542
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:47,489
- Join Team Red. - Let's pick green.

543
00:19:47,523 --> 00:19:50,125
Let's pick green.

544
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,460
- Shuffle them well. - Please.

545
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,461
Don't join us.

546
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:55,330
Only Jong Kook can save our team.

547
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,866
- Let's go. - Pick a green spoon.

548
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,436
- Let's go. - Pick well.

549
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:04,406
(If Jae Seok picks green, Jong Kook joins Team Red automatically.)

550
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:08,010
(Jae Seok's selection determines the fate of Team Red and Green.)

551
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,578
- Please. - Don't join us.

552
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,649
(Avoid the green one.)

553
00:20:13,782 --> 00:20:15,350
Yours is the last one.

554
00:20:18,821 --> 00:20:20,289
(He can't believe it.)

555
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:26,795
(Jae Seok joins Team Green. Haha and Jong Kook join Team Red.)

556
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:29,698
This is unbelievable.

557
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:31,733
Come here.

558
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,235
(They become the worst team.)

559
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,737
- Hey. - Did you see him?

560
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:38,540
He grabbed the green spoon directly.

561
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,775
(It's surprising.)

562
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,810
- Listen. - He must be...

563
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,246
attracted to green.

564
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:46,181
I can't believe it.

565
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,249
It's the worst.

566
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:51,320
Why can't I get away from Seok Jin and Jae Seok?

567
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,088
Who went to Okinawa with me?

568
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:54,089
(He's tired of them.)

569
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,457
- Mongolia. - How about Mongolia?

570
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:57,059
Where's Team Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

571
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,494
How about Australia?

572
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,129
- Why am I in here? - This is too hard.

573
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:04,333
- I don't belong with them. - Seriously, it's too tiring.

574
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:05,934
I can't get away from them.

575
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:07,803
- It drives me crazy. - Why?

576
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,204
Random selection doesn't work either.

577
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,406
Why am I so unlucky?

578
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:15,811
What about me? I'm going to lose my mind.

579
00:21:15,811 --> 00:21:16,979
(Team Blue, Team Red, and Team Green)

580
00:21:16,979 --> 00:21:18,413
- Please step back. - Okay.

581
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:20,048
We should do well since there are only three teams.

582
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:22,117
Only the person in the front can pop the balloon.

583
00:21:22,117 --> 00:21:24,686
If another team member grabs the question,

584
00:21:24,686 --> 00:21:26,054
the other team keeps it.

585
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:27,356
Let's grab it when the balloon pops.

586
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:28,757
Grab it when the balloon pops.

587
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,360
Let's avoid Jong Kook's team and steal from Team Green.

588
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,195
Let's steal from Team Green first.

589
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:35,330
- Grab the other teams. - Right.

590
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,566
- Shall we? - Just grab them.

591
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,134
Let's stand when they come near us.

592
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:40,969
Get ready, set.

593
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:42,971
I'll be sitting down here.

594
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:45,841
Are you scared? Are you afraid?

595
00:21:45,974 --> 00:21:48,610
- Hey, Glasses. Try to attack us. - "Glasses"?

596
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,212
Look at him.

597
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:52,514
- That guy... - This is frustrating.

598
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:54,049
(We have Jong Kook with us.)

599
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,451
- You don't scare us at all. - He's a coward.

600
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:59,988
Let's go to the coward.

601
00:21:59,988 --> 00:22:01,823
(Did you call Haha a coward?)

602
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:03,825
- Are you going forward? - Hey.

603
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,327
(Team Red attacks Team Blue.)

604
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,697
- Go, go. - There's a camera.

605
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,766
We should do something.

606
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:12,334
Let's get them from the back.

607
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,503
Target Se Chan.

608
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:15,938
Let's get them from the back.

609
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,708
Target Se Chan. Go this way.

610
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:21,743
- Hey. - No.

611
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:25,113
(Ji Hyo attacks Se Chan.)

612
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:26,949
- That's right. - Grab it quickly.

613
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:29,952
(It was a close call, but Se Chan runs away.)

614
00:22:30,052 --> 00:22:32,154
- We almost had it. - Get closer, Ji Hyo.

615
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:34,590
- Hurry. - Don't catch me.

616
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:36,291
Come on.

617
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,061
- Hey. - Be careful.

618
00:22:41,063 --> 00:22:43,432
- Come on. - Get a little closer.

619
00:22:43,432 --> 00:22:45,233
- Be careful. - Get a little closer.

620
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,235
Get a little closer.

621
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,437
(They chase at full speed.)

622
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:50,405
Stop. Grab it.

623
00:22:50,606 --> 00:22:54,176
(Sang Yeob grabs Team Green's balloon.)

624
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:56,011
- He's coming. - Get him.

625
00:22:56,945 --> 00:22:58,180
- Let's go. - Grab the question.

626
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,681
(Grab the question.)

627
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,049
- Grab the question. - What?

628
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,619
(Did they drop the question?)

629
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:04,786
No!

630
00:23:05,287 --> 00:23:06,622
Give it to me.

631
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:08,690
Give it to me.

632
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,992
I got it.

633
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,093
Okay.

634
00:23:11,093 --> 00:23:12,894
- Let's go. - We have to put it there.

635
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:14,096
We have to put it there.

636
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,397
Move to the left.

637
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,432
- 1, 2, 1, 2. - Let's go!

638
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:19,301
(We have to hurry.)

639
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:22,838
(Where are you going?)

640
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,806
Get Han Na!

641
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:25,941
(Charging)

642
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:27,676
(Team Red attacks Team Blue's balloon.)

643
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,678
Get it!

644
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:30,912
(Team Red attacks Team Blue's balloon.)

645
00:23:31,146 --> 00:23:32,147
(We have to get there first!)

646
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,815
- Go! - Go!

647
00:23:35,183 --> 00:23:36,184
Hurry!

648
00:23:36,184 --> 00:23:38,620
(Kwang Soo touches down first.)

649
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,888
Where is the question?

650
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:41,890
- It hasn't burst yet. - Where is it?

651
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:43,091
It's burst.

652
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,559
Put the question down.

653
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,994
- It's burst. - It's here.

654
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,095
It's here.

655
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:49,698
It's here. You saw it, didn't you?

656
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:51,566
Tear it.

657
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,802
- It's here. - Ours is here.

658
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:56,338
Sang Yeob's team gets to answer the question.

659
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:58,473
It's torn.

660
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:01,343
(Kwang Soo puts Team Blue's question paper in his mouth...)

661
00:24:01,343 --> 00:24:03,679
(and puts his down.)

662
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,813
That's ours.

663
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,515
- I'm so exhausted. - That's ours.

664
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,784
- Did you put it in your mouth? - Yes.

665
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:10,085
Sang Yeob gets to answer the question.

666
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:13,121
(Sang Yeob gets to answer the question.)

667
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,390
Do we get a chance if they fail?

668
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,793
- Ours is on the cushion. - It's here.

669
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:20,696
Decide the order, and say the four letters.

670
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:22,264
Sang Yeob should go first.

671
00:24:22,264 --> 00:24:23,532
Like this.

672
00:24:23,765 --> 00:24:25,200
You have to answer right away.

673
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,069
- Each person says one letter. - Start.

674
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:29,671
What is the name of the technology...

675
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:31,807
for wireless local area networking...

676
00:24:31,807 --> 00:24:34,009
based on radio waves or infrared rays? Start.

677
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:38,680
(The correct answer is WiFi.)

678
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,752
(Sang Yeob, just say, "W".)

679
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,620
WiFi. W.

680
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,523
(He says all four letters.)

681
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:49,624
(Fail)

682
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:50,826
Hey!

683
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:52,928
- Just one letter! - Sang Yeob!

684
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:54,162
W, I, F, I.

685
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:55,731
Just one letter!

686
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:59,301
Why did you say the whole word? We all knew the answer!

687
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,470
We have a chance.

688
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:02,971
- We all knew the answer. - I mean...

689
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:04,706
Is he stupid?

690
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:07,476
- How could you? - I did my best.

691
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,444
- Come on. - Sang Yeob, you're doing great.

692
00:25:09,444 --> 00:25:11,079
- You're doing great. - Way to go!

693
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,415
Don't steal my stupid image.

694
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,549
It's Haha's.

695
00:25:14,616 --> 00:25:16,685
- It's Haha's. - It took me three years.

696
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:19,454
- It's Haha's. - Sang Yeob is doing great.

697
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:20,589
(Sorry)

698
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:23,592
Each person says one letter.

699
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,827
We talked about it.

700
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:28,396
I'm too impatient.

701
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,564
Okay.

702
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,799
I'm sorry.

703
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,400
Thank you.

704
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,602
(Could Sang Yeob be the coach?)

705
00:25:33,668 --> 00:25:35,504
- Here goes the next question. - Let's go.

706
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:36,505
Let's go!

707
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,340
If we say the correct answer, we'll get a hint, right?

708
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:40,041
- Yes. - We need to...

709
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,543
- win the hint by all means. - We'll move.

710
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:42,544
We'll move...

711
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:43,979
and attack them.

712
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:45,514
Look for a chance.

713
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,415
- Ready. - Jong Kook...

714
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,651
Let's go for Jong Kook's team.

715
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:50,786
Okay.

716
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:52,721
Wait for us. Approach them.

717
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:54,156
Come here.

718
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:55,624
(Team Blue wants to attack Team Red head-on.)

719
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,726
Let's attack Jong Kook.

720
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:59,127
- Let's go. - Okay.

721
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,163
- Let's go. - Kwang Soo, get them.

722
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:03,832
(Kwang Soo, get them.)

723
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,600
- Get them! - Stay away.

724
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,335
- Get them. - Get them.

725
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:09,104
Attack Kwang Soo.

726
00:26:09,104 --> 00:26:11,239
- Okay. - I got their balloon.

727
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:14,743
(Team Red gets Team Blue's balloon.)

728
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,645
We got it. We can go now.

729
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:19,915
(Jae Seok has an eye on Team Red's balloon.)

730
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,683
- Come on! - We got the balloon.

731
00:26:21,683 --> 00:26:24,119
(They have the balloon.)

732
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:25,320
(The question paper drops.)

733
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,556
- Get it! - Let's go!

734
00:26:27,556 --> 00:26:28,557
Go!

735
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,159
(Ji Hyo picks up the paper.)

736
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,394
Come here.

737
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:33,895
- Go! - Where is the paper?

738
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,730
- Where is it? - Go!

739
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,499
- Go! - Let's go!

740
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:39,601
(To get the chance, they have to get to the cushion first.)

741
00:26:39,601 --> 00:26:41,903
(What?)

742
00:26:41,903 --> 00:26:43,605
So Min. Hold on.

743
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:45,340
- What happened to her? - So Min.

744
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,843
(So Min falls.)

745
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,345
- Get up! - So Min.

746
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:52,047
- So Min. - Get up!

747
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:54,182
- Hey. - That was close.

748
00:26:54,182 --> 00:26:55,250
Hey.

749
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,919
So Min fell. Move!

750
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,155
Kwang Soo.

751
00:27:00,155 --> 00:27:03,325
(Kwang Soo touches down.)

752
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,894
Gosh. So Min.

753
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:07,696
- So Min. - So Min.

754
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:08,964
So Min.

755
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:10,899
Kwang Soo will say the first letter.

756
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:12,567
- Okay. - It's okay.

757
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:13,902
They won't get it right.

758
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,003
- Ready. - I'll go first.

759
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:17,939
You have to say the answer right away. Ready, start.

760
00:27:17,939 --> 00:27:19,641
What is the name of the organization...

761
00:27:19,641 --> 00:27:22,177
that pursues to preserve the world's natural and cultural heritage?

762
00:27:22,177 --> 00:27:23,178
U.

763
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:25,080
(The correct answer is UNESCO.)

764
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,586
(The first letter is right. Da Hee, say, "Ne".)

765
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,522
- Well... - Hey.

766
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,092
(What?)

767
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,693
- Hey. - Hey.

768
00:27:38,693 --> 00:27:40,428
It's UNESCO.

769
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:43,832
- UNESCO. - Da Hee.

770
00:27:43,832 --> 00:27:45,233
Even I knew the answer.

771
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,168
Even I knew it.

772
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:48,536
Was that a goat?

773
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:51,473
- I was going to say, "Ne". - Goodness.

774
00:27:51,473 --> 00:27:53,275
I give my title to her.

775
00:27:53,275 --> 00:27:55,710
(She can be the stupid one.)

776
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,712
- I can't believe this. - It's okay.

777
00:27:57,712 --> 00:27:59,581
It's okay.

778
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,316
I'm sorry.

779
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:02,617
I'm really sorry.

780
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:03,952
(Puzzled)

781
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:05,620
We did a good job.

782
00:28:06,054 --> 00:28:07,589
You thought it was UNICEF, didn't you?

783
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,590
What?

784
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,192
(Nodding)

785
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:12,894
You thought it was UNICEF?

786
00:28:12,894 --> 00:28:14,162
Seriously?

787
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:16,364
- Really? - Gosh.

788
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:19,301
- UNICEF offers money. - Seriously?

789
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:22,003
- Is that true? - Stop it now.

790
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,605
I'm so sick of it.

791
00:28:23,605 --> 00:28:25,173
Really?

792
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:27,676
I said, "It's UNESCO," after hearing someone say it.

793
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:29,177
Was it a coincidence?

794
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:31,313
Someone over here said it's UNESCO.

795
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,315
Da Hee must have frozen.

796
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:35,617
It'd be understandable if Kwang Soo did.

797
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:37,485
Da Hee was the second player.

798
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,887
I even said U.

799
00:28:38,887 --> 00:28:39,988
You knew it was UNESCO, right?

800
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:41,423
- Yes. - Yes.

801
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:43,591
Even I knew it.

802
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,626
Let's take a break.

803
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:45,760
(Did Da Hee say the wrong answer on purpose?)

804
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,697
So Min, why did you fall?

805
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:51,199
- Well... - You should never run.

806
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,435
It suddenly felt so heavy.

807
00:28:53,468 --> 00:28:54,903
There was a huge stone.

808
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,237
(Team Green failed because of So Min.)

809
00:28:56,838 --> 00:29:01,543
(Could So Min be the coach?)

810
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:05,046
Let's go to the final race place.

811
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,881
- Let's go. - I'm disappointed.

812
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:09,117
(Will they identify the coaches during the final mission?)

813
00:29:09,818 --> 00:29:10,885
(Final Race)

814
00:29:10,885 --> 00:29:13,888
It's time for the final race.

815
00:29:13,989 --> 00:29:16,458
Let me explain the rules for I Am on the National Team.

816
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:18,927
(I Am on the National Team)

817
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:22,163
Find the hints about the coaches and the gold medalist...

818
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:25,200
hidden in this building. Using the hints,

819
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,670
pick out and eliminate the coaches at the trial...

820
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,773
which is held every 30 minutes.

821
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:33,308
- There will be trials? - Trials?

822
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:34,976
- It's been a long time. - Indeed.

823
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,379
(They need to find as many hints as possible.)

824
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,613
Okay.

825
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,181
(The highlight of the race)

826
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:43,518
You'll also find invitations to the gala show.

827
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:44,619
- Gala show? - Gala show?

828
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,187
(Gala show)

829
00:29:46,888 --> 00:29:48,990
Once you find it, you can't transfer it to anyone.

830
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,894
You have to attend the show with a person of your choice.

831
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,963
The venue and time will be announced later.

832
00:29:54,963 --> 00:29:57,298
- What's that? - Gala show?

833
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,800
- Are we going to perform? - Are we going to?

834
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,302
Only four people can attend the gala show.

835
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:04,472
If there are less coaches, the coaches will be eliminated,

836
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:06,174
and it's the same the other way around.

837
00:30:06,174 --> 00:30:09,744
(The group with less people will be eliminated.)

838
00:30:09,744 --> 00:30:11,880
For example, if there are 3 coaches and 1 player...

839
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,881
The player will be out.

840
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,516
If there are three players,

841
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:15,517
the coach will be out.

842
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:16,851
(The minority will be eliminated.)

843
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,688
Three coaches will try to bring a player.

844
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:21,689
I guess.

845
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,591
If there are 2 coaches and 2 players...

846
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,795
or if all of them are players, nothing will happen.

847
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:28,229
(Nothing will happen.)

848
00:30:28,797 --> 00:30:31,032
If there are 2 and 2, it'll be fierce.

849
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,333
We need to choose the right one.

850
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,403
Please go to your positions now.

851
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:36,871
- Let's get it! - Let's get it!

852
00:30:36,871 --> 00:30:39,007
(Will they be able to eliminate all the coaches?)

853
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,377
(Everyone is in position.)

854
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:44,612
All right. I'll win...

855
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,048
and experience the Luxury Package.

856
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:53,488
I'm suspecting Jae Seok and Da Hee.

857
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,324
I want to be careful today.

858
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:58,927
Let me think after finding some hints.

859
00:30:59,594 --> 00:31:02,097
Da Hee has been a little suspicious.

860
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,665
Da Hee.

861
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,101
The thing is,

862
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:09,204
when she couldn't say anything after I said, "U",

863
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:10,972
it was too strange.

864
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:14,809
It showed in the bus too.

865
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:15,944
(It showed.)

866
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,782
Da Hee has been talkative today.

867
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:21,950
(Jin Young suspects Da Hee too.)

868
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,351
I suspect Da Hee.

869
00:31:24,185 --> 00:31:26,354
(Meanwhile, Da Hee...)

870
00:31:26,354 --> 00:31:29,324
(sighs deeply.)

871
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,494
Let's start the race.

872
00:31:32,494 --> 00:31:33,661
Five.

873
00:31:34,496 --> 00:31:35,630
Four.

874
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:37,132
Three.

875
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,567
2, 1.

876
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:41,469
The race starts.

877
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:43,738
Let's go.

878
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:47,942
(The final race starts.)

879
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,178
I need to find the hints.

880
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:51,379
(They have to find the hints.)

881
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,847
It can't be here, right?

882
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:54,082
It can't be...

883
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:58,052
(Coaches should be eliminated at the trial 30 minutes later.)

884
00:31:58,052 --> 00:32:00,622
In the trash can? I guess not.

885
00:32:00,622 --> 00:32:01,656
(The coaches need to eliminate the gold medalist.)

886
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:02,957
Have you found anything yet?

887
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,826
- No. - Are you...

888
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:06,728
a coach? No, right?

889
00:32:06,728 --> 00:32:08,062
I'm just a player.

890
00:32:08,062 --> 00:32:10,098
- Right? - I'm nothing.

891
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:12,734
- Whom do you suspect? - Jae Seok is definitely suspicious.

892
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,035
And Da Hee.

893
00:32:14,202 --> 00:32:16,337
- So Min! - Hey.

894
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:18,406
Have you found any hints yet?

895
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,475
What? Yes.

896
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:22,010
- You've found something? - What?

897
00:32:22,076 --> 00:32:23,244
So Min, come here.

898
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,481
Are you really not a coach?

899
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:28,283
- No. - Are you sure?

900
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:33,321
They don't let me do these things because I get caught easily.

901
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:35,356
- You get caught? - They don't let me.

902
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:39,494
- Ever since I messed up once. - You messed up?

903
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,595
Did it show too much?

904
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:42,897
I'm looking for the medalist and the coaches.

905
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:44,566
- I see. - You can't find anything there.

906
00:32:44,566 --> 00:32:46,467
Jong Kook and Jae Seok are there.

907
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,468
You haven't found anything yet?

908
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:49,003
I'm going to look somewhere else.

909
00:32:49,003 --> 00:32:50,805
- Where? - In the main building.

910
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:51,873
- Really? - Come with me.

911
00:32:51,873 --> 00:32:53,007
Okay.

912
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:58,880
(Jong Kook is looking for hints in the annex lobby.)

913
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,515
"Love Battery"? What's that?

914
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,818
What's that? What is this?

915
00:33:04,686 --> 00:33:06,054
"Scout list"?

916
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,655
I didn't know about this list.

917
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:10,658
What's this?

918
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:14,729
(There's another scout list?)

919
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,932
(Two lists in different colors are in the main and annex buildings.)

920
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,969
When we started, they didn't explain about the list.

921
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,370
My guess is that...

922
00:33:22,637 --> 00:33:25,173
the coaches will probably scout their players.

923
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:27,875
That's to put things simply. That's what the word means.

924
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,845
(He listens to Se Chan for a while.)

925
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:33,348
You seem to be well-informed.

926
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:35,516
- Pardon? - You seem to know a lot.

927
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,952
Jong Kook, it's not rocket science. Don't you know English?

928
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,821
Are you usually...

929
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,990
- this sharp? - I'm on top of my game today.

930
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,591
(Did he always have good reasoning skills like today?)

931
00:33:43,591 --> 00:33:46,527
In my opinion, they will try to pick the card for the Luxury Package.

932
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:48,329
Once they get six members, it's over.

933
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:51,132
My gosh. They startled me.

934
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,835
(The sound of the staff passing by...)

935
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:55,436
(scared him this much?)

936
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:56,704
They startled me.

937
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,806
- Is that how you should play this? - What do you mean?

938
00:33:58,806 --> 00:33:59,974
You think this is good enough?

939
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,142
(He sounds threatening.)

940
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:03,311
- You think this is good enough? - What's up with your right fist?

941
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,813
Hold on. I might be in trouble. Everyone, don't move.

942
00:34:05,813 --> 00:34:07,148
(He retreats right away.)

943
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:08,249
Hold on a second.

944
00:34:08,249 --> 00:34:09,450
Jong Kook.

945
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:10,685
Are you a coach? Hold on.

946
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:12,120
- One second. - If you put names on the list...

947
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,023
- Let me make a round. - Hey, I'm not a coach.

948
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,491
I was just sharing my opinion.

949
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,092
(His pupils shake.)

950
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,494
Why did I come here?

951
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,163
Why did I come here?

952
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,998
Jong Kook, I'm going to go.

953
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:25,933
Pretend you didn't see me. You never saw me.

954
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,135
Why did you come here?

955
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:28,970
I was just passing by.

956
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,971
(He becomes Jong Kook's target.)

957
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:31,105
Okay. Tell you what.

958
00:34:31,406 --> 00:34:32,573
For now...

959
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:35,476
(You scared me.)

960
00:34:35,877 --> 00:34:37,211
I think I might've peed.

961
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:38,680
Let me go to the restroom and check.

962
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,915
- We'll part our ways for now. - Okay.

963
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,052
I got it. I didn't come here for you.

964
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,321
- Scout? - Scout. Okay.

965
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,790
- Thank you for the information. - Why is there a scout list?

966
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,859
(What is the purpose of that scout list?)

967
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:55,029
(Jong Kook comes upstairs to find a hint.)

968
00:34:55,029 --> 00:34:56,497
It's not easy to find one.

969
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,203
What's this?

970
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:03,504
Wait.

971
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:04,972
No way.

972
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,407
(He finally finds a hint.)

973
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:07,542
It's in black.

974
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,111
It's in black.

975
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:13,314
What is this? A pair of sunglasses?

976
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,482
(What? Sunglasses?)

977
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,851
When you put them on, you'll be given the hint.

978
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:17,919
The sunglasses?

979
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,187
(The hint will be given by a voice message.)

980
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:21,089
Stop lying. If I wear them,

981
00:35:22,023 --> 00:35:23,191
I'll get the hint?

982
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,894
Coach A is a member of Running Man.

983
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:31,532
(This is a hint about Coach A. Coach A is a member of Running Man.)

984
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:33,768
Hold on.

985
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:35,570
If the coach is a member of the show...

986
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,571
(Sang Yeob, Da Hee, Jin Young, and Han Na aren't Coach A.)

987
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,374
The four special guests we have aren't official members of the show.

988
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:43,745
(Coach A is 1 of the 8 members of Running Man.)

989
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:47,715
It's Jae Seok then. It's Jae Seok.

990
00:35:48,649 --> 00:35:50,218
I must meet up with him then.

991
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:54,322
(Jae Seok is looking for a hint in the wardrobe department.)

992
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,524
(He spots a hint.)

993
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,860
(He puts on the sunglasses for the hint.)

994
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:05,400
It's been 10 years or more since Coach C's debut.

995
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,337
Except Han Na, everyone debuted 10 years ago.

996
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:13,975
(Everyone's debut was 10 years ago except Han Na's.)

997
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:19,614
(Kwang Soo finds a hint too.)

998
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:29,757
Coach C is a woman.

999
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,061
One of them was a woman.

1000
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:37,098
(Ji Hyo, Da Hee, Jin Young, and So Min debuted at least 10 years ago.)

1001
00:36:39,934 --> 00:36:41,469
- Da Hee. - Yes?

1002
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:43,438
I bet you'll be eliminated after 10 minutes.

1003
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:45,173
- What? - You'll be out in 10 minutes.

1004
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:47,208
- Kwang Soo. - It's a sure thing.

1005
00:36:47,308 --> 00:36:50,344
- You... - Whatever you do, you'll be out.

1006
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:52,480
Don't eliminate me.

1007
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,614
Try to find a lot of hints.

1008
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:56,284
- Coaches can eliminate us, right? - What?

1009
00:36:56,284 --> 00:37:00,021
They can eliminate the gold medalist or other members, right?

1010
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:01,355
Of course.

1011
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:02,757
How?

1012
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:04,625
They can remove the name tags to check.

1013
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,728
(They can remove the name tags to check.)

1014
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,430
- Is it Name Tag Elimination? - What?

1015
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,766
Can't they? Don't you have a name tag?

1016
00:37:11,766 --> 00:37:13,501
(In the race, you can remove name tags.)

1017
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:14,836
In this race, we don't do that.

1018
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:16,804
Of course, we do.

1019
00:37:17,438 --> 00:37:18,840
- Am I wrong? - Yes. You don't know the rules.

1020
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,007
My gosh.

1021
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,410
- Let me tell you one thing. - What is it?

1022
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,744
If you're not the coach,

1023
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:27,448
go to a clinic as soon as we're done with the shoot.

1024
00:37:28,549 --> 00:37:29,917
You...

1025
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,752
Or it could be that you're truly dumb.

1026
00:37:31,752 --> 00:37:33,421
No, I'm not dumb.

1027
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:34,589
Hey.

1028
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,458
It's because I haven't played a game like this on TV.

1029
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:38,459
I'm just new to this.

1030
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:39,994
- I never played this with friends. - What is this?

1031
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,263
Can't she manage her anger? What was that?

1032
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:43,397
(Why is she angry at me?)

1033
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:44,832
I mean, seriously.

1034
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:47,134
Why are you angry at me? You...

1035
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,370
- Hey. - Listen.

1036
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,605
- Are you drunk or what? - What?

1037
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,206
- No, that's not it. - Hold on a second.

1038
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:54,842
- Try to see it from my perspective. - No, let go. I don't get you.

1039
00:37:58,246 --> 00:37:59,347
Sorry?

1040
00:37:59,347 --> 00:38:01,315
(The staff members urgently pull Da Hee away.)

1041
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:02,650
- Hey! - No, no. Come.

1042
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:04,752
- Let's talk in private. - What's happening to me?

1043
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:07,622
(For the first time, she gets a crash course about the race.)

1044
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:10,658
(Isn't this how you play?)

1045
00:38:10,658 --> 00:38:12,727
Hey, you. What's going on?

1046
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,762
- Did you find a hint? - It's not that.

1047
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:16,898
- She's explaining the rules again. - Is that so?

1048
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,266
(She's embarrassed.)

1049
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:21,335
Is that a high-level strategy? Did you get a mission?

1050
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:22,803
- What will I do? - Haha.

1051
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,805
- Isn't she acting weird? - She said we're tearing name tags.

1052
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:28,242
No, listen. She was having a meeting with the writer.

1053
00:38:28,242 --> 00:38:29,810
- She was explaining it again. - Hey, don't make it obvious.

1054
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,512
- It's not fun then. - Exactly.

1055
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:32,914
- All right, Da Hee. - No, listen.

1056
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:34,348
You can do better next time, okay?

1057
00:38:34,348 --> 00:38:36,350
- Okay. - It's not over yet.

1058
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,686
- Don't be so chatty next time. - Come again?

1059
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:40,321
You weren't supposed to tell the rules.

1060
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,156
If you tell everyone that, everyone knows you're the coach.

1061
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,292
I'm not the coach, Kwang Soo.

1062
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,459
No. Okay.

1063
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:46,928
- Do you want to walk together? - No, stop doing that.

1064
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,763
- Don't ask me things like that. - Why not?

1065
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,431
You're too scary. Go away.

1066
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,333
- Please go away. - Hey.

1067
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,101
- Hey. - Get lost! Don't talk to me.

1068
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,905
When I don't know the rules, you should teach me nicely.

1069
00:38:57,905 --> 00:38:59,307
I just didn't know the rules.

1070
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:00,975
We could've found a hint, you know.

1071
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:02,543
- Don't distract me. - You fool.

1072
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,780
(She's full of mysteries. Is she really a coach?)

1073
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,317
(Se Chan finds the scout list on the 1st floor of the main building.)

1074
00:39:09,317 --> 00:39:10,518
What's this?

1075
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,154
(Scout List)

1076
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:16,123
(What is this?)

1077
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:19,460
(On the scout list,)

1078
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,063
(there are photos?)

1079
00:39:22,063 --> 00:39:23,230
That's Haha.

1080
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:24,966
Is someone taking photos of us?

1081
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,601
(What are these photos for?)

1082
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,471
There are photos of Kwang Soo, Haha, and Jae Seok.

1083
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:32,607
(Kwang Soo, Haha, and Jae Seok are in the photos.)

1084
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:34,108
Is someone taking photos of us here?

1085
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,612
Is someone taking photos of us here?

1086
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:40,314
(Why are these photos on the list?)

1087
00:39:40,314 --> 00:39:41,482
Jong Kook.

1088
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,184
Jong Kook, I have something to tell you.

1089
00:39:43,184 --> 00:39:45,553
Come here. We were sharing information. Come quickly.

1090
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:47,555
Hey, this will probably shock you.

1091
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:48,923
- Right now... - We shared everything here.

1092
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:52,326
- Someone is taking photos. - What?

1093
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:54,161
- Someone is taking photos. - Hey.

1094
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:56,263
- They will put photos on that list. - Listen.

1095
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:58,599
There are two photos on the board now.

1096
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:01,102
- The photos on the list are... - Whose photos are they?

1097
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:03,971
- Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, - Okay.

1098
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,574
- and Haha. - My photo is on it?

1099
00:40:06,574 --> 00:40:07,942
- Hey. - They are on the scout list.

1100
00:40:07,942 --> 00:40:10,144
- You'll be eliminated soon. - In my opinion...

1101
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:11,979
- You should stay away from this. - Listen.

1102
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,914
- How will I stay away? - Say that Haha gets eliminated.

1103
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,217
Say that Haha gets eliminated.

1104
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:18,185
My reasoning will be correct.

1105
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,188
To eliminate members, coaches must put their photos on the list.

1106
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,857
(Photos will lead to elimination.)

1107
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:26,727
(When their photos are on the list, they will be eliminated?)

1108
00:40:26,727 --> 00:40:28,396
- This is my opinion. - Then I...

1109
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:29,697
- Listen. - Okay.

1110
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,599
It's highly likely that Jae Seok staged this.

1111
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,236
(It's highly likely that Jae Seok staged this.)

1112
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,040
(His photo on the scout list is staged by Jae Seok?)

1113
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,741
He took a photo of himself.

1114
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,476
- He did the same thing before. - He did that once.

1115
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:45,446
It's because he's known for staging set-ups.

1116
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:47,448
- He even sprayed his name tag once. - Exactly.

1117
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:52,186
(Last summer, during the race between thieves and the sheriff,)

1118
00:40:52,186 --> 00:40:55,823
(he sprayed paint on his name tag to thwart suspicions.)

1119
00:40:55,823 --> 00:41:00,094
(With years of experience as a spy, he fooled everyone.)

1120
00:41:00,094 --> 00:41:02,196
- He even sprayed his name tag once. - Exactly.

1121
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:03,431
He's the best at staging set-ups.

1122
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,332
(Don't trust him.)

1123
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,934
Jae Seok.

1124
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,736
There's something I want to tell you.

1125
00:41:09,036 --> 00:41:11,038
You're in a sticky situation now.

1126
00:41:11,505 --> 00:41:12,940
- During the first trial... - What about the hint?

1127
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,742
- Seok Jin. - You're in danger.

1128
00:41:14,742 --> 00:41:17,778
Hints are your weapons in court.

1129
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:19,780
Your gibberish isn't.

1130
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,549
(Your gibberish is useless in court.)

1131
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:22,883
I wasn't talking nonsense.

1132
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:26,353
As an old friend, I'm giving you an advice.

1133
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:27,855
You might be eliminated during the first trial.

1134
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:30,224
Don't worry about me. I'll let the hints speak for themselves.

1135
00:41:30,424 --> 00:41:32,326
I've already acquired supporters.

1136
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:36,030
I can't say this because I'm worried a coach might be among us.

1137
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,031
(I'm being careful.)

1138
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,466
That's you.

1139
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,935
- Seok Jin, go on your way. - Okay. I'll be on my way.

1140
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:42,036
- Do your best. - All right.

1141
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:43,070
He's in a pickle now.

1142
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,140
I think he will be eliminated in the first trial.

1143
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:51,612
(Is Jae Seok, the expert in staging set-ups, a coach?)

1144
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,382
Where are the hints?

1145
00:41:56,851 --> 00:41:59,487
(To Jin Young, this race is too hard.)

1146
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:01,122
I can't find any.

1147
00:42:01,722 --> 00:42:04,925
(She finds the scout list now.)

1148
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,129
What's this? What is it?

1149
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,867
(Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Haha, and Sang Yeob)

1150
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:15,603
- So Min, come here. - What's that?

1151
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:17,638
What? What is this? Did they get recruited?

1152
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:18,906
(So Min sees the list too.)

1153
00:42:20,508 --> 00:42:22,510
- This is how they get recruited. - No way.

1154
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,845
- Coaches must've taken them. - Who took these photos?

1155
00:42:24,845 --> 00:42:26,413
- Who took these? - I don't know.

1156
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,316
(It seems the people in the photos...)

1157
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,451
Hold on a second.

1158
00:42:30,451 --> 00:42:33,187
(aren't affected for the time being.)

1159
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,457
- Kwang Soo. Who is this? - Sang Yeob. Haha.

1160
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:39,760
Seok Jin. Isn't this Seok Jin? Yes, it is.

1161
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,662
(Jae Seok, Haha, Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and Sang Yeob are on it.)

1162
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:44,899
(Then why were these photos taken?)

1163
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:47,234
Why can't I find any hints?

1164
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,904
When did we meet? It was taken on the second floor.

1165
00:42:49,904 --> 00:42:51,005
(He's shocked after seeing it.)

1166
00:42:51,005 --> 00:42:52,506
But Haha is the ultimate idiot.

1167
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:54,542
- He won't remember. - He probably can't remember.

1168
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,277
It was taken upstairs. Right there.

1169
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,745
Da Hee was there too.

1170
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:00,748
Where we got our photos taken isn't important.

1171
00:43:00,748 --> 00:43:04,285
- Think about whom we were with. - At that time?

1172
00:43:04,285 --> 00:43:06,921
- It's because... - Player Seok Jin is out.

1173
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:11,392
(Is Seok Jin eliminated?)

1174
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:17,198
(Why is Seok Jin eliminated all of a sudden?)

1175
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:20,901
Here's a hint on Coach B.

1176
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,169
Se Chan.

1177
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:23,537
(Here's a hint on Coach B.)

1178
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,506
- What is it? - We get a hint on Coach B.

1179
00:43:25,506 --> 00:43:27,274
His main profession is acting.

1180
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,110
(Coach B's main profession is acting.)

1181
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,313
- What? - Acting?

1182
00:43:32,313 --> 00:43:34,081
- Gosh. - Coach B is an actor.

1183
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,749
- Wait. - Are you an actor?

1184
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,084
- Is he... - What are you?

1185
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,152
(Aren't you an actor?)

1186
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:39,920
- Is it you? - What are you?

1187
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,223
Come on, I've been on Running Man for eight years.

1188
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:44,725
Are you an entertainer or an actor? Answer the question.

1189
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,927
Tell us accurately.

1190
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,028
- Listen. - Are you Coach B?

1191
00:43:48,028 --> 00:43:50,731
(I make people laugh, and I also act.)

1192
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:51,932
Coach B is...

1193
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:55,169
The trial is about to start soon.

1194
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,972
Please gather to the courtroom.

1195
00:43:58,205 --> 00:44:00,507
- We only got one hint on Coach B. - Coach B?

1196
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:04,211
We need to find out how Seok Jin was eliminated.

1197
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:07,014
Is there a photo of Seok Jin at the first-floor cafe?

1198
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:08,082
- There is. - Right.

1199
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,850
- I brought it right now. - Is there one?

1200
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,552
- His photo was taken. - Listen.

1201
00:44:11,552 --> 00:44:14,388
The one whose photo is taken and attached is eliminated.

1202
00:44:14,388 --> 00:44:16,257
- That's how you get eliminated. - Right.

1203
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:18,225
- Here's what's funny. - Really?

1204
00:44:18,225 --> 00:44:20,194
Among the members in the photos,

1205
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:22,796
some of them staged a set-up.

1206
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,198
- We must remember it. - Definitely.

1207
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:26,267
- Let's see who they are. - They're over there.

1208
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:28,135
(They check the scout list one last time.)

1209
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:31,505
(Only Da Hee's photo remains on the scout list.)

1210
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:32,806
Who is it?

1211
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:34,475
- It's her. - She staged it.

1212
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:35,910
- It's Da Hee. - It's a set-up.

1213
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,580
We suspected that it was Da Hee from the beginning.

1214
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,714
That's why she did it.

1215
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:42,383
It's very clear to me now.

1216
00:44:42,383 --> 00:44:43,851
I know all except the gold medalist.

1217
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:45,819
(Everyone heads to the trial.)

1218
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:48,789
How did Seok Jin get eliminated?

1219
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,491
I'm scared to be in the courtroom again.

1220
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:51,625
(1st trial session starts.)

1221
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:53,560
I figured everything out.

1222
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,696
Really? You have a sixth sense.

1223
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:58,032
You'll be very surprised.

1224
00:44:58,032 --> 00:45:00,601
So Min, do you have a younger brother?

1225
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,202
- I do. - Really?

1226
00:45:02,436 --> 00:45:04,071
- Is that a hint? - Yes.

1227
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:05,506
What is it, Da Hee?

1228
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,675
- What is it, Jae Seok? - Goodness.

1229
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:09,109
- What is it? - This is crazy.

1230
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:10,477
Da Hee.

1231
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:12,179
What is it, Jae Seok?

1232
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,614
You'll make a big mistake.

1233
00:45:13,614 --> 00:45:15,015
- If I get eliminated... - He's here.

1234
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,617
- You're here, coach. - Me?

1235
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:19,420
(Everyone's present including Kwang Soo who's been suspicious.)

1236
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,523
(Who are the 3 coaches?)

1237
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:25,693
One of the members is eliminated.

1238
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:26,827
That's right.

1239
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:29,296
We can't let the coaches trick us.

1240
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,432
As you know,

1241
00:45:31,532 --> 00:45:34,234
- the losing teams will compete. - No way.

1242
00:45:34,234 --> 00:45:36,870
Remember this. There are lies...

1243
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,672
to what people said.

1244
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:41,375
- There are groundless rumors. - So keep that in mind.

1245
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:45,980
I'll tell you one hint of mine that's most accurate.

1246
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,948
- It's a general hint. - A general hint.

1247
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:49,817
- It's not Se Chan. - Right.

1248
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:52,686
(It's not Se Chan.)

1249
00:45:52,686 --> 00:45:55,456
- Stop it. - Let me participate in the game.

1250
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,257
Let me participate in the game.

1251
00:45:57,257 --> 00:45:58,759
- He's not suspicious at all. - Let me...

1252
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,028
be a part of the game. Why are you denying me?

1253
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:03,163
- Let me say it again. - Why do you deny me?

1254
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:05,566
According to the hint I have, it isn't Se Chan.

1255
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,468
It's not specific to any coaches.

1256
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:10,771
- In general, it isn't Se Chan. - Then what is he?

1257
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,940
Who am I? Am I someone who will be eliminated?

1258
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,475
Wait a minute.

1259
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:18,312
Is it possible the hint said that it excluded Se Chan?

1260
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:20,080
- That makes no sense. - What do you think?

1261
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,949
This is possible.

1262
00:46:22,049 --> 00:46:25,986
Jae Seok's hint may be related to the gold medalist.

1263
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:28,989
What's certain is that it's not Se Chan.

1264
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:30,991
- Shall I just go home? - I said it several times.

1265
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,559
I'm not needed here.

1266
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,229
- Se Chan. - Why do you give me a hard time?

1267
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:37,564
Go start your car.

1268
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,767
It's not you.

1269
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:41,602
(Go spend time for yourself.)

1270
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:44,004
"Start your car"?

1271
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:47,174
Let's share hints related to the coaches.

1272
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,376
- Coach C. - C?

1273
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:50,577
Let's catch Coach C.

1274
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,579
- Any hints about Coach C? - I have one.

1275
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,114
- I do too. - I do.

1276
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:55,649
We know a lot about Coach C.

1277
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:56,884
What do you know about Coach C?

1278
00:46:56,884 --> 00:47:00,154
- Coach C is female. - It's a female.

1279
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:01,755
- She uses her legal name. - It's her legal name.

1280
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:03,023
That's right.

1281
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,725
Coach C...

1282
00:47:04,725 --> 00:47:06,960
has over 10 years of experience.

1283
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,328
10 years?

1284
00:47:08,796 --> 00:47:11,832
(The candidates are Jin Young, Da Hee, and So Min.)

1285
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:12,966
Han Na is excluded.

1286
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:15,569
- She also has a younger brother. - She has a younger brother?

1287
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:17,971
(Coach C has a younger brother.)

1288
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,040
Who has a younger brother?

1289
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,308
Da Hee and So Min.

1290
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:23,010
Wait a minute.

1291
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:27,748
I think Da Hee is lying about having a younger brother.

1292
00:47:27,748 --> 00:47:31,018
That's wrong, Han Na. That hint is...

1293
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,653
Just go to prison later.

1294
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,421
(He cuts her off.)

1295
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:37,558
- You'll go to prison first. - Da Hee looks so tired.

1296
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:38,859
(Da Hee looks tired today.)

1297
00:47:38,859 --> 00:47:41,161
You rank zero place, Da Hee.

1298
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:42,229
- That's not it. - Just go.

1299
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:44,965
- All I do is deny that it's not me. - Wait a minute.

1300
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,600
Everyone.

1301
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:50,070
It's time to point out one person.

1302
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,972
Please discuss amongst yourselves.

1303
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:53,974
Let's catch Coach C.

1304
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:55,109
C?

1305
00:47:55,175 --> 00:47:56,243
Let's catch Coach C.

1306
00:47:56,243 --> 00:47:58,245
- Coach C is... - It's most convincing.

1307
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,314
- Han Na, it's So Min. - We have to make it clear.

1308
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:01,882
I'm about to lose my mind.

1309
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:03,917
I tried to convince them in the past,

1310
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,586
- but I was eliminated. - Really? Should I not say anything?

1311
00:48:05,586 --> 00:48:08,088
- No. - Then everyone will suspect me.

1312
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,156
Then get on the list.

1313
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:10,557
- I'm not it. - Why don't you...

1314
00:48:10,557 --> 00:48:13,393
- To be honest... - Don't lose a talented member.

1315
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:21,268
(Don't lose a talented member.)

1316
00:48:21,268 --> 00:48:22,536
Are you losing yourself?

1317
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:24,938
- Are you losing yourself? - Don't say anything.

1318
00:48:24,938 --> 00:48:26,306
Don't say anymore.

1319
00:48:26,306 --> 00:48:28,308
What is she saying? Talented what?

1320
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:29,643
She claims to be precious.

1321
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:30,711
What did you say?

1322
00:48:30,711 --> 00:48:32,679
I bet everyone thinks this.

1323
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,248
"She's a coach."

1324
00:48:34,448 --> 00:48:37,084
- Will we accuse her now or later? - Hey.

1325
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,919
- Give me a chance. - She's like an insurance.

1326
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,989
Da Hee, can you give us a reason why you're not a coach?

1327
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,524
Let me explain.

1328
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,092
(Sighing)

1329
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:47,027
- I'd be surprised if she's acting. - Let's listen.

1330
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,829
My goodness.

1331
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,131
Let me say one thing.

1332
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:56,203
I asked Da Hee how the coaches eliminate other members.

1333
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,607
At first, she said by tearing off their name tags.

1334
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,545
- Then at the same place, - She knew it already.

1335
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:08,482
I saw her getting scolded by one of the writers.

1336
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:09,850
I witnessed it.

1337
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:12,753
(I witnessed her getting scolded by one of the writers.)

1338
00:49:12,753 --> 00:49:14,388
- At the same place, - Kwang Soo.

1339
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,089
- I was there. - We saw it.

1340
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:17,624
- We saw it. - Did you see it?

1341
00:49:17,624 --> 00:49:19,526
- I saw it. - We witnessed it.

1342
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:22,229
- Each person... - The writer was frustrated.

1343
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,898
- No way. - Who should be the first?

1344
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,934
- Tell us, Da Hee. - Da Hee...

1345
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,969
- kept patting my back. - Really?

1346
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,904
You and you...

1347
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:33,540
are coaches. I'll expose you.

1348
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,477
- I'm only telling the truth. - Da Hee.

1349
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:39,713
- Jae Seok. - You have one minute to talk.

1350
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:41,782
- Da Hee... - Please say your last words.

1351
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:44,051
The writer was about to slap her.

1352
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:45,986
I was there too.

1353
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,188
- The writer looked frustrated. - I was shocked.

1354
00:49:48,188 --> 00:49:51,058
I was talking to other members on the second floor.

1355
00:49:51,058 --> 00:49:55,429
I heard Da Hee coming, but she stayed outside instead.

1356
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:59,099
Are you suspecting me too? You sided with me before.

1357
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,969
It's so easy to embarrass someone.

1358
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,806
(It's so easy to embarrass someone.)

1359
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,343
- Wait. - Fine, fine. I'll just go up.

1360
00:50:09,343 --> 00:50:12,212
(She's completely upset.)

1361
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:14,414
- Don't. - Wait, Da Hee.

1362
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,650
- That's not what we meant. - No, it wasn't.

1363
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,152
Da Hee, what was the hint that you found?

1364
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,587
Da Hee is crying!

1365
00:50:20,587 --> 00:50:21,922
No, I'm not.

1366
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:24,691
(He's surprised.)

1367
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:26,493
- Da Hee is crying. - This is frustrating.

1368
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:28,762
No, I'm not a coach.

1369
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:31,898
- I'm not it. - Cry in prison instead.

1370
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:34,501
Why are you ruining the atmosphere?

1371
00:50:34,501 --> 00:50:36,303
- Da Hee. - It's so unfair.

1372
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:38,238
- I won't do this with Da Hee. - Kwang Soo.

1373
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:40,907
Da Hee might sign with her blood.

1374
00:50:41,074 --> 00:50:44,511
It'd be amazing if it wasn't her.

1375
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:46,413
Please say whom you suspect.

1376
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:48,782
- I think it's Da Hee. - It's Da Hee.

1377
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:50,951
I also think it's Da Hee.

1378
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,819
- What do you think, Kwang Soo? - I think...

1379
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:54,688
- I'm not it. - Tell us.

1380
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:55,856
- Is it Da Hee? - Yes.

1381
00:50:55,856 --> 00:50:57,090
- What do you think, Jin Young? - It's Da Hee.

1382
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:59,159
- Does everyone think it's Da Hee? - Yes.

1383
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,894
- Then... - Go up.

1384
00:51:00,894 --> 00:51:03,297
- She's going up. - Let's go, Da Hee.

1385
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:04,865
- Let's go, Da Hee. - Da Hee.

1386
00:51:04,865 --> 00:51:07,067
We'll reveal Da Hee's identity.

1387
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:10,771
Is Da Hee a coach or a player?

1388
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:12,839
Or is she the gold medalist?

1389
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:14,775
It's either Da Hee or So Min.

1390
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:16,476
It's definitely So Min if it isn't Da Hee.

1391
00:51:16,476 --> 00:51:18,111
You're terrible.

1392
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:21,481
- So Min, you're the worst. - 1, 2, 3.

1393
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:24,151
(If she's a player, 2 players will be eliminated in total.)

1394
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:28,455
- What if she's the gold medalist? - 2, 3.

1395
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:29,923
(If she's the gold medalist, the coaches win.)

1396
00:51:30,691 --> 00:51:33,226
(Is Da Hee a coach as everyone expected?)

1397
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:34,828
(Player)

1398
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:36,897
- What? - Was she a player?

1399
00:51:41,635 --> 00:51:43,303
Don't make that face.

1400
00:51:43,303 --> 00:51:44,671
- Was she a player? - What's this?

1401
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:46,039
- This is creepy. - I knew it.

1402
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,508
Da Hee is a player.

1403
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:50,277
This is creepy.

1404
00:51:50,377 --> 00:51:51,778
(They're creeped out.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1405
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:53,347
- Turn around, Da Hee. Show us. - I knew it.

1406
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:56,817
You suspected me, right? You're a coach.

1407
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:00,520
- What? - Calm down, Da Hee.

1408
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,090
It's not like we have a lot of money at risk.

1409
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,225
- It's possible to make mistakes. - It's just a show.

1410
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:07,427
- How could she cry? - What did I do so wrong?

1411
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:09,529
They're in a relationship as she called him a coach.

1412
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:11,765
- No. - That must be it.

1413
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:13,900
- That's not right. - Look at them.

1414
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,802
- That's wrong. - It wasn't Da Hee?

1415
00:52:15,802 --> 00:52:18,839
- That means it's So Min. - It's So Min.

1416
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:20,907
- Me? - It's definitely her.

1417
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:23,276
- You suspected me. - Seriously?

1418
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:29,149
(Coach C has over 10 years of experience.)

1419
00:52:29,149 --> 00:52:32,152
(It's a woman who uses her legal name.)

1420
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:35,021
(Coach C has a younger brother.)

1421
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:37,257
(Coach)

1422
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:39,292
(Jeon So Min)

1423
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,363
(Coach C is So Min.)

1424
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:47,334
(Coaches have the ability to eliminate the gold medalist.)

1425
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,369
(Take a photo of a member suspected to be the gold medalist.)

1426
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:52,305
(Put it on the red scout list.)

1427
00:52:52,305 --> 00:52:55,642
(Coaches can eliminate members by tearing off their name tags.)

1428
00:52:55,642 --> 00:52:59,780
(Hints about the coaches are given if they eliminate a player.)

1429
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:05,952
(When Seok Jin was eliminated, a hint about Coach B was revealed.)

1430
00:53:05,952 --> 00:53:11,525
(Was Seok Jin not the gold medalist?)

1431
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,428
I'm not a coach, I swear.

1432
00:53:14,428 --> 00:53:18,298
(Let me deny it for now.)

1433
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:21,067
Someone must be framing you.

1434
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:23,069
You're being framed like I was.

1435
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,338
I'm always the first one to get eliminated.

1436
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:26,740
Then again,

1437
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,675
they wouldn't let you be a coach, would they?

1438
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:30,043
- That's right. - What?

1439
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:32,712
(They wouldn't let you be a coach, would they?)

1440
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:34,781
What are you talking about?

1441
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:35,916
Are you serious?

1442
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:38,952
- Da Hee, you should smile. - I am smiling.

1443
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:40,554
- How could she say such a thing? - Why would you diss her?

1444
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:42,489
(How could she say such a thing?)

1445
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:43,690
I quit.

1446
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,159
(I quit.)

1447
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,761
- Hold on. - What is this?

1448
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:48,962
- Hey. - Are you kidding me?

1449
00:53:48,962 --> 00:53:50,764
- She is new. - Goodness.

1450
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:52,065
Come back.

1451
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,601
- Are you scared? - What is this?

1452
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:57,370
Let's go back and get ready for round two.

1453
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:58,638
Let's go.

1454
00:54:00,607 --> 00:54:03,009
Everyone will suspect me now. What should I do?

1455
00:54:03,009 --> 00:54:04,744
It'll be my turn next time.

1456
00:54:04,744 --> 00:54:06,246
I can't find a way out.

1457
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:09,015
Jin Young doesn't have a little brother.

1458
00:54:09,483 --> 00:54:11,918
I can't guess who the gold medalist is.

1459
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:15,655
Also, what about Da Hee? I never took a picture of her.

1460
00:54:15,655 --> 00:54:16,790
(I never took a picture of her.)

1461
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:21,761
Now that I think of it, I never took a picture of Da Hee.

1462
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:25,398
But a picture of her was on the blue list.

1463
00:54:25,398 --> 00:54:27,167
Someone else must have taken it.

1464
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,604
But it can't be anyone on my team.

1465
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:34,107
I guess the gold medalist took the picture.

1466
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,576
(Someone who is not a coach is taking pictures?)

1467
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,981
(Is the gold medalist taking pictures too?)

1468
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:43,850
(She needs to find the gold medalist soon.)

1469
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,553
Han Na has been suspecting Da Hee.

1470
00:54:46,553 --> 00:54:49,823
She suspected Jin Young at first, but she changed her mind.

1471
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:56,096
(Han Na was active during the first trial.)

1472
00:54:56,229 --> 00:55:00,767
(Did Han Na try to eliminate Da Hee because she is a gold medalist?)

1473
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,703
She was so active. I suspect she is the gold medalist.

1474
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,939
Should I put a picture of Han Na on the list?

1475
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,841
Han Na...

1476
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:10,143
(Is Han Na really the gold medalist?)

1477
00:55:10,277 --> 00:55:15,048
The race will begin again.

1478
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:17,884
No one has taken a picture of me. Let me check the pictures.

1479
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:19,786
And...

1480
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:23,890
Someone is there.

1481
00:55:24,758 --> 00:55:25,759
Is that Jae Seok?

1482
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:28,161
(When he sticks his head out,)

1483
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:31,498
(he sees Jae Seok standing still.)

1484
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:34,134
(What is he doing?)

1485
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,369
What are you doing?

1486
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:39,072
- What do you mean? - Why are you...

1487
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:41,308
I'm just looking around. I don't know who the coaches are.

1488
00:55:41,308 --> 00:55:42,709
(Jae Seok looks suspicious.)

1489
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,679
I think he took a picture of me.

1490
00:55:46,146 --> 00:55:48,148
(What was he doing?)

1491
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:49,549
I think he took a picture of me.

1492
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,284
Gosh.

1493
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:53,420
(Jae Seok finds a nobody.)

1494
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,588
- Hey. - Yes?

1495
00:55:54,654 --> 00:55:56,056
Go find hints.

1496
00:55:56,323 --> 00:55:58,458
I can't find anything.

1497
00:55:58,458 --> 00:55:59,593
- You should... - Se Chan.

1498
00:55:59,593 --> 00:56:01,194
- Yes? - Come here.

1499
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:03,763
There he goes again.

1500
00:56:03,763 --> 00:56:05,231
- He's making me uncomfortable. - Hey.

1501
00:56:05,231 --> 00:56:08,068
- Don't let him see you. - I should run away.

1502
00:56:08,068 --> 00:56:09,803
- Just go. - Bye, Jong Kook.

1503
00:56:09,803 --> 00:56:10,870
(I'm running away.)

1504
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:12,806
Why would you tell him?

1505
00:56:13,273 --> 00:56:14,774
I'm different from you.

1506
00:56:14,774 --> 00:56:15,775
(Weak)

1507
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:16,977
I wish I could just leave.

1508
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,379
- Se Chan. - Yes?

1509
00:56:19,379 --> 00:56:22,015
- Come here right now. - Okay.

1510
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:24,417
We're friends. Come over here quickly.

1511
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,418
We're friends?

1512
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:27,253
(We're uncomfortable friends.)

1513
00:56:27,253 --> 00:56:28,388
Come here.

1514
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:30,256
- Between Friends. - Between Friends.

1515
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,093
I was just sitting here.

1516
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:38,398
- I was watching Jin Young. - Okay.

1517
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:41,534
Look at this. This chair.

1518
00:56:41,534 --> 00:56:43,403
- Do you remember it? - Yes.

1519
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,739
- I took a picture... - Hold on.

1520
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:46,940
Please leave us alone.

1521
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:48,975
- Jong Kook. - Just pass by.

1522
00:56:48,975 --> 00:56:51,845
- We need to talk. - Se Chan has nothing to do with...

1523
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:53,513
- today's game. - No.

1524
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:55,048
But I do.

1525
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:56,383
Jong Kook.

1526
00:56:56,383 --> 00:56:58,752
It's the same as talking to any pedestrian.

1527
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:00,787
I think he took a picture of me...

1528
00:57:00,787 --> 00:57:02,422
or something.

1529
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,691
- You think... - If you see...

1530
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:06,926
a picture of me,

1531
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:08,161
you can be sure.

1532
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,130
- Jong Kook. - We can be sure even now.

1533
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:11,598
He definitely is a coach.

1534
00:57:11,598 --> 00:57:13,800
- To be sure... - To be sure...

1535
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:16,903
If something happens to me, just keep that in mind.

1536
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:19,272
(Screaming)

1537
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:20,607
What happened?

1538
00:57:21,174 --> 00:57:22,342
What's wrong?

1539
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:23,543
What is it?

1540
00:57:23,543 --> 00:57:24,844
(Jin Young receives a hint.)

1541
00:57:24,844 --> 00:57:26,613
- What happened? - Haha.

1542
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:28,181
Did you find it? What is it?

1543
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:30,116
(Share it with us.)

1544
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:31,584
- Are you just a player? - Yes.

1545
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:34,554
Coach A is over 40.

1546
00:57:34,554 --> 00:57:36,556
(Coach A is over 40.)

1547
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:39,559
(Jong Kook)

1548
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:41,327
(Jae Seok)

1549
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:44,664
It must be Jae Seok. We should consider Jong Kook too.

1550
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,733
(Coach A is among these three.)

1551
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:49,002
Jae Seok came to my mind right away.

1552
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:52,338
All right. Keep it in mind.

1553
00:57:52,338 --> 00:57:53,840
- Okay. - Keep looking.

1554
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,475
- We have to. - Saved in my heart.

1555
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,476
(Saved in my heart)

1556
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:58,745
- Saved. - Saved...

1557
00:57:58,745 --> 00:58:00,146
- In our hearts. - In our hearts.

1558
00:58:00,146 --> 00:58:01,381
Saved...

1559
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:02,882
- In the players' hearts. - In the players' hearts.

1560
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,517
Hurry up.

1561
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:06,686
(They're closer to identifying the coaches.)

1562
00:58:06,686 --> 00:58:09,322
This is my last chance.

1563
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,558
I need to risk everything.

1564
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:13,960
There's only a picture of Da Hee.

1565
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:15,995
This board must be...

1566
00:58:16,396 --> 00:58:19,432
for gold... What's the word?

1567
00:58:19,432 --> 00:58:20,567
(Behind So Min...)

1568
00:58:20,567 --> 00:58:21,968
(is Han Na?)

1569
00:58:21,968 --> 00:58:24,704
It must be the list for the gold medalist.

1570
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:27,640
I think this picture was taken in the lobby.

1571
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:30,910
On the way to the dressing room. She is looking a little up.

1572
00:58:31,144 --> 00:58:33,313
She must have been looking at Kwang Soo.

1573
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,783
I'm suspecting Han Na. She was attacking Da Hee.

1574
00:58:36,783 --> 00:58:38,351
(What is she saying?)

1575
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:40,386
Should I take a picture of Han Na?

1576
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:43,590
(Peekaboo)

1577
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:46,159
(Surprised)

1578
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:47,160
Han Na.

1579
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,696
(Surprised)

1580
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:51,564
I've been hiding here...

1581
00:58:52,298 --> 00:58:53,633
to find a coach.

1582
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,470
(And the most suspected member has shown up.)

1583
00:58:57,637 --> 00:58:59,506
I've been hiding here...

1584
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,574
to find a coach.

1585
00:59:02,142 --> 00:59:05,912
(And the most suspected member has shown up.)

1586
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,448
(I hope she didn't hear what I said.)

1587
00:59:09,282 --> 00:59:10,583
I'm here to find you.

1588
00:59:10,583 --> 00:59:13,787
- Why? - I suspect you.

1589
00:59:13,787 --> 00:59:15,755
- As what? - As a coach.

1590
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:17,123
- A coach? - Yes.

1591
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,660
When I got here,

1592
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,028
you were touching the machine.

1593
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:23,363
- I was just curious. - I thought...

1594
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:25,498
you were going to print a picture. Then you'd be a coach.

1595
00:59:25,498 --> 00:59:26,800
No.

1596
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,568
I have nothing to print.

1597
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:29,569
Then you're not a coach.

1598
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:31,337
(You're not a coach.)

1599
00:59:31,337 --> 00:59:33,473
I've been suspecting you.

1600
00:59:33,473 --> 00:59:35,108
Everyone is suspecting me.

1601
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:36,376
Are you the gold medalist?

1602
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:38,144
- No. - Really?

1603
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:40,480
Are you just feeling a bit down?

1604
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,482
- Do I look down? - I mean...

1605
00:59:42,482 --> 00:59:43,583
- You're a bit quiet. - But even if...

1606
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,953
I am the gold medalist, I wouldn't tell you.

1607
00:59:46,953 --> 00:59:48,488
Okay. Because I might be a coach?

1608
00:59:48,488 --> 00:59:49,889
- Yes. - Okay.

1609
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,124
- But... - Then...

1610
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:53,726
you should tell me the truth.

1611
00:59:53,726 --> 00:59:56,095
If I die during the next trial...

1612
00:59:56,095 --> 00:59:58,464
(Han Na, take the bait.)

1613
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:00,667
- If you're the gold medalist... - I don't know what to do.

1614
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:02,268
She must be the gold medalist.

1615
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,237
(So Min must be the gold medalist.)

1616
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:05,839
I don't know what to do.

1617
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:08,341
- Everyone is suspecting me. - So Min.

1618
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,476
I can't tell you anything more.

1619
01:00:10,643 --> 01:00:13,379
I can't trust you. Everyone is suspecting me.

1620
01:00:13,379 --> 01:00:17,684
- What should we do? - I have to find a coach.

1621
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:19,686
- Okay. Go now. - I'll get going.

1622
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:23,189
What is this? So Min must be the gold medalist.

1623
01:00:23,189 --> 01:00:24,624
(She's completely fooled.)

1624
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:26,926
I need to run away.

1625
01:00:28,294 --> 01:00:30,864
Gosh, I'm so scared.

1626
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:32,365
What should I do?

1627
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:36,269
I don't want to be a spy ever again.

1628
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:37,270
(It shortens your life.)

1629
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,972
It shortens your life.

1630
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,740
(What will happen to the novice spy?)

1631
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,175
I'm a bad liar.

1632
01:00:43,209 --> 01:00:44,244
Who is it?

1633
01:00:44,244 --> 01:00:46,512
So Min shouldn't be eliminated.

1634
01:00:47,046 --> 01:00:49,415
I need to find another hint.

1635
01:00:49,883 --> 01:00:51,484
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1636
01:00:52,018 --> 01:00:53,786
Whom are you suspecting?

1637
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,522
- It's definitely So Min. - No, I don't think so.

1638
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:59,292
- The hints point to her. - No, you're wrong.

1639
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,660
We shouldn't eliminate her.

1640
01:01:00,927 --> 01:01:02,262
- We shouldn't. - Why not?

1641
01:01:02,262 --> 01:01:04,097
It's not her.

1642
01:01:04,397 --> 01:01:06,065
She's being framed.

1643
01:01:06,065 --> 01:01:09,369
I'm here to defend her.

1644
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,639
I don't think it's So Min.

1645
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:14,407
My goodness.

1646
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:16,976
We need to decide based on the hints.

1647
01:01:16,976 --> 01:01:19,178
- It's my hunch. - What?

1648
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:20,680
Have you found any hints?

1649
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,549
I found a hint that So Min is not a coach.

1650
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,985
Really? We've all been suspecting her.

1651
01:01:25,985 --> 01:01:28,354
That's the problem. So Min shouldn't be eliminated.

1652
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:30,423
- So Min is not a coach. - She isn't.

1653
01:01:30,423 --> 01:01:33,826
I went to the scout list.

1654
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:35,728
I was hiding...

1655
01:01:35,728 --> 01:01:38,097
She was trying to find the coaches.

1656
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:42,068
Stop depending on your hunch.

1657
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:44,103
- Hold on. - Coach Jeon So Min is out.

1658
01:01:44,103 --> 01:01:45,204
Who?

1659
01:01:45,204 --> 01:01:47,273
Coach Jeon So Min is out.

1660
01:01:47,273 --> 01:01:50,543
(Coach Jeon So Min is out.)

1661
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:51,711
Coach? She's a coach?

1662
01:01:51,711 --> 01:01:52,845
- She is. - "Coach Jeon So Min is out."

1663
01:01:52,845 --> 01:01:54,414
- She's a coach? - She was a coach.

1664
01:01:54,414 --> 01:01:56,482
- How did she get eliminated? - You should be quiet.

1665
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:58,184
- Keep your mouth shut. - I shouldn't do anything.

1666
01:01:58,184 --> 01:02:00,987
Keep your mouth shut.

1667
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:03,423
- Ji Hyo. - She said So Min was not a coach.

1668
01:02:03,423 --> 01:02:05,224
- Hey. - But...

1669
01:02:05,224 --> 01:02:06,292
I think...

1670
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,293
- Hey. - Ji Hyo.

1671
01:02:07,293 --> 01:02:08,594
- You don't even have any hints. - She kept on saying...

1672
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:10,196
So Min was not a coach.

1673
01:02:10,196 --> 01:02:11,764
Come to think of it,

1674
01:02:11,764 --> 01:02:14,901
when the writer asked why I thought she was the gold medalist,

1675
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:16,836
she pulled out her phone.

1676
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:20,206
(After So Min deceived Han Na)

1677
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:22,742
What's going on? I think So Min is the gold medalist.

1678
01:02:23,977 --> 01:02:25,311
Let's wait here.

1679
01:02:25,311 --> 01:02:27,347
I think this spot is where you can get some hints.

1680
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:29,582
(She gets closer.)

1681
01:02:31,484 --> 01:02:33,486
- Why are you still here? - What?

1682
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:35,254
- Why are you hiding here? - I'm looking for the coaches.

1683
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:37,123
(So Min was going to walk up to her and take a picture from behind.)

1684
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:38,591
Are you taking a picture?

1685
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,293
No.

1686
01:02:41,661 --> 01:02:44,797
(I can see it.)

1687
01:02:44,797 --> 01:02:47,300
- I didn't take a picture. - What did you do with your phone?

1688
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,768
- I didn't. - Hold on. What's this?

1689
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:49,802
I didn't take any pictures.

1690
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:51,404
- Really? Let me see your phone. - I didn't.

1691
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:53,506
- I didn't take a picture. - Let me see your gallery.

1692
01:02:53,506 --> 01:02:55,174
- So Min. - I didn't take any pictures.

1693
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:57,343
But what about your phone?

1694
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,278
- I didn't. - You were looking at it.

1695
01:02:59,879 --> 01:03:02,348
I wasn't looking at my phone. I was looking at you from behind.

1696
01:03:02,348 --> 01:03:03,716
I looked at the mirror here.

1697
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:05,385
- Why would you look at me? - No, I looked at the mirror.

1698
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,620
- I looked at myself in the phone. - Oh, okay.

1699
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:09,322
(That resolved her doubt.)

1700
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:12,492
What was that? I thought you were the gold medalist.

1701
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:15,128
- She was looking in the mirror. - Hey.

1702
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,397
I guess that was that. Was she taking a picture of me to kill me?

1703
01:03:17,397 --> 01:03:20,333
(She comes to a big realization.)

1704
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,768
(She got tricked by So Min's nonsense.)

1705
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:23,436
What am I doing, Ji Hyo?

1706
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:25,071
I think I shouldn't do anything.

1707
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:26,672
- Han Na, you should stay still. - I got everything wrong.

1708
01:03:26,672 --> 01:03:28,107
I might get eliminated this way.

1709
01:03:28,107 --> 01:03:31,477
I think I'm hopeless in solving mysteries.

1710
01:03:32,111 --> 01:03:34,047
(She confesses that she's hopeless in solving mysteries.)

1711
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:36,149
You have to talk based on evidence.

1712
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:38,718
Stop talking based on your hunch.

1713
01:03:38,718 --> 01:03:40,420
- Hey. - I shouldn't do anything.

1714
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,188
- Stop abusing yourself. - You don't have any evidence.

1715
01:03:42,188 --> 01:03:44,390
(She won't try to help So Min now.)

1716
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:46,292
(By the way, how did So Min get eliminated?)

1717
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,994
- Come here. - Hey.

1718
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:50,830
- Come here. - You're a coach, right?

1719
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:52,532
(She arrests Coach Jeon So Min.)

1720
01:03:52,532 --> 01:03:53,633
- She's a coach, right? - Seok Jin.

1721
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:55,768
- Look at her. She's like this. - She's a coach.

1722
01:03:55,768 --> 01:03:57,804
- She's this kind of person. - Oh, gosh.

1723
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,773
- She said this to me. - You're so shrewd.

1724
01:04:00,773 --> 01:04:02,975
- "I swear it's not me." - I'll never trust you.

1725
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,611
- So Min. - Somebody is worse than me.

1726
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:07,246
(They feel betrayed.)

1727
01:04:07,246 --> 01:04:09,315
- Who? - What?

1728
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:11,250
Can I say who it is?

1729
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,518
(Can I say who eliminated me?)

1730
01:04:13,086 --> 01:04:17,190
(Who's the gold medalist that got Coach So Min out?)

1731
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,727
(At that moment, Haha finds a hint.)

1732
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:25,231
The gold medalist uses their real name.

1733
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:27,333
(The gold medalist uses their real name.)

1734
01:04:27,333 --> 01:04:31,304
(They use their real name?)

1735
01:04:31,437 --> 01:04:32,805
My gosh.

1736
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:34,474
It was right next to the white box.

1737
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:37,543
(Ji Hyo finds a hint in the corner too.)

1738
01:04:37,543 --> 01:04:40,146
The gold medalist has been to Daema Island.

1739
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:42,014
(The gold medalist has been to Daema Island.)

1740
01:04:42,014 --> 01:04:47,753
(If they've been to Daema Island and use their real name,)

1741
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:52,258
(the gold medalist is either Sang Yeob or Kwang Soo.)

1742
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:55,361
(Is the gold medalist Sang Yeob or Kwang Soo?)

1743
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:57,497
- Han Na. - Yes?

1744
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:01,367
- What? - You might eliminate me.

1745
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:02,468
I won't.

1746
01:05:02,468 --> 01:05:03,803
- Did anything happen? - Do you want to talk?

1747
01:05:03,803 --> 01:05:05,872
Was there any information?

1748
01:05:05,872 --> 01:05:07,974
Information? About whom?

1749
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,376
About everybody. About Coach A or B.

1750
01:05:10,476 --> 01:05:12,145
- About A or B? - Yes.

1751
01:05:12,879 --> 01:05:14,780
- Are you the gold medalist? - What?

1752
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:17,750
(By any chance,)

1753
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:21,320
(is Sang Yeob a gold medalist looking for hints about the coach?)

1754
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,922
I have to find some hints.

1755
01:05:24,357 --> 01:05:27,026
Should I take a picture?

1756
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:29,529
(He wants to take a picture?)

1757
01:05:30,663 --> 01:05:32,798
(Kwang Soo can take a picture.)

1758
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:35,835
(What is his identity?)

1759
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:41,107
You saw this and didn't tell me.

1760
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:43,976
Please give me the hint.

1761
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:46,512
Coach B is a male.

1762
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:49,882
(Coach B is a male.)

1763
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:57,590
(In an earlier hint, they said Coach B's occupation was acting.)

1764
01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,159
(Then Coach B is an actor.)

1765
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:01,427
My goodness.

1766
01:06:01,994 --> 01:06:04,397
It's either Kwang Soo or Sang Yeob.

1767
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:09,969
(Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo are strong candidates for Coach B.)

1768
01:06:10,636 --> 01:06:13,339
- Did you find anything? - I found nothing.

1769
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:16,008
(The hints about the gold medalist and Coach B both point to them.)

1770
01:06:16,008 --> 01:06:17,710
What about you? Did you find anything?

1771
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,512
No, so nobody wants to share information with me.

1772
01:06:19,512 --> 01:06:20,947
(One of them is the gold medalist, and the other is Coach B.)

1773
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:22,782
Let's take the pictures first and send it.

1774
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,852
(What are their identities?)

1775
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,755
Tell me the results of your investigation.

1776
01:06:29,755 --> 01:06:31,190
The investigation result is...

1777
01:06:31,557 --> 01:06:32,592
(Give me your name tag!)

1778
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:34,694
(My investigation result leads to you.)

1779
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:35,995
- What was that? - There.

1780
01:06:37,263 --> 01:06:38,531
What was that?

1781
01:06:38,831 --> 01:06:41,200
(Han Na is out.)

1782
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,369
- What was that? - I'm sorry.

1783
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:44,570
Who are you?

1784
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:46,539
- Isn't it you? - What?

1785
01:06:47,273 --> 01:06:49,242
Isn't it her? Isn't she...

1786
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:51,377
Aren't you the gold medalist?

1787
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:57,283
(Sang Yeob is after the gold medalist.)

1788
01:06:57,283 --> 01:07:01,621
(He's a coach who got turned down by the players and held a grudge.)

1789
01:07:01,621 --> 01:07:04,624
(Let me see who's on our scout list.)

1790
01:07:04,624 --> 01:07:06,025
Who's this?

1791
01:07:06,225 --> 01:07:07,827
I have Seok Jin too.

1792
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:11,163
(He found out that the gold medalist is a coward.)

1793
01:07:11,163 --> 01:07:13,432
The gold medalist is a coward.

1794
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:17,703
(He hunted down Seok Jin.)

1795
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:19,672
(Ripping)

1796
01:07:19,672 --> 01:07:22,775
(Seok Jin is out.)

1797
01:07:22,775 --> 01:07:26,512
(He got an innocent player out.)

1798
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:27,680
It's Han Na.

1799
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,449
(His next target is Han Na.)

1800
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:34,186
(I think she's the gold medalist.)

1801
01:07:35,421 --> 01:07:37,657
(He hunted her down right away.)

1802
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:39,792
- What was that? Who are you? - I'm sorry.

1803
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:41,093
Who are you?

1804
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:42,995
- Isn't it you? - What?

1805
01:07:42,995 --> 01:07:44,196
Aren't you the gold medalist?

1806
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:45,898
- Are you a coach? - I am.

1807
01:07:45,898 --> 01:07:47,033
(I'm a coach.)

1808
01:07:47,033 --> 01:07:49,035
(Oh, dear.)

1809
01:07:49,035 --> 01:07:51,037
(I can trust anybody here.)

1810
01:07:51,037 --> 01:07:54,040
I'm sorry. I guessed wrong.

1811
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,409
Han Na is out.

1812
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:59,278
(Sang Yeob was Coach B who got Han Na out.)

1813
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:03,149
(Who is Kwang Soo who can take pictures?)

1814
01:08:03,816 --> 01:08:04,850
(This morning, in a secret place)

1815
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:08,120
This is the 36th Running Man Olympics.

1816
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:10,022
The stickers are gone.

1817
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,557
Kwang Soo,

1818
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:14,327
you're the gold medalist.

1819
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:16,162
(Kwang Soo was the gold medalist.)

1820
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:21,167
(Da Hee was suspicious and slandered him,)

1821
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:25,538
(so he took a picture of her right away.)

1822
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:29,709
(Like the coaches who glued the photos on the red scout list,)

1823
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:32,044
(the gold medalist could also glue the coach's photo on the blue list.)

1824
01:08:32,044 --> 01:08:33,179
- Da Hee? - Yes.

1825
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:34,580
- What about you, Jin Young? - Da Hee.

1826
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:39,485
(He thought she was a strong candidate, but she was a player.)

1827
01:08:39,485 --> 01:08:43,956
(As the gold medalist, I'll get the coach out next.)

1828
01:08:43,956 --> 01:08:45,424
- It's So Min. - It's her.

1829
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:46,692
- It's So Min. - It has to be her.

1830
01:08:46,692 --> 01:08:47,960
According to the list...

1831
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:51,063
- No, go. It's okay. - Why?

1832
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:53,499
(He finally bumped into her. This was his chance.)

1833
01:08:53,499 --> 01:08:58,237
(He got his phone ready to take a picture of her.)

1834
01:08:58,237 --> 01:09:01,974
(I'm the gold medalist.)

1835
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,643
(But I'm the gold medalist.)

1836
01:09:04,643 --> 01:09:07,747
(You must be a coach then.)

1837
01:09:08,414 --> 01:09:10,850
(Typing)

1838
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,218
(Hold on.)

1839
01:09:12,218 --> 01:09:13,652
Give it to me.

1840
01:09:13,652 --> 01:09:16,589
Give it to me. What are you doing? Give it to me.

1841
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:18,324
(He flapped his long arms to send a picture of her.)

1842
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:22,795
(The picture was glued on, so he just had to get her out.)

1843
01:09:22,795 --> 01:09:24,630
(Struggling)

1844
01:09:25,598 --> 01:09:28,067
(This is an intense struggle between the coach and the medalist.)

1845
01:09:28,067 --> 01:09:29,735
Why are you doing this to me?

1846
01:09:29,735 --> 01:09:32,037
- You know better. - You can't do this.

1847
01:09:32,037 --> 01:09:33,606
(Ripping)

1848
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:37,343
(He got So Min out.)

1849
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,311
(It was Kwang Soo who got Coach So Min out.)

1850
01:09:39,311 --> 01:09:41,380
Oh, dear.

1851
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:46,318
(Coaches versus Gold Medalist)

1852
01:09:46,385 --> 01:09:52,191
- Player Kang Han Na is out. - What?

1853
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:53,926
(Han Na is out?)

1854
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:55,227
- Hey. - See?

1855
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:59,131
(They're startled by the news.)

1856
01:10:00,132 --> 01:10:03,335
- Here's a hint about Coach B. - Who? B?

1857
01:10:03,502 --> 01:10:04,804
Coach B is...

1858
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:07,606
a male.

1859
01:10:07,606 --> 01:10:11,744
(Coach B is a male.)

1860
01:10:12,178 --> 01:10:14,313
It's a male?

1861
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:16,982
It's either Kwang Soo or Sang Yeob then.

1862
01:10:16,982 --> 01:10:18,284
It's Sang Yeob.

1863
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:19,785
I'll repeat.

1864
01:10:19,785 --> 01:10:23,055
(Kwang Soo hears the hint.)

1865
01:10:23,055 --> 01:10:26,192
(Coach B was Sang Yeob!)

1866
01:10:26,192 --> 01:10:27,526
I got goose bumps. Come here, Ji Hyo.

1867
01:10:27,526 --> 01:10:28,994
(Kwang Soo is Coach B.)

1868
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:31,530
I didn't know Kwang Soo was like that. Don't be like that.

1869
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:32,932
Hold on.

1870
01:10:32,932 --> 01:10:34,567
(What? It's not me!)

1871
01:10:36,902 --> 01:10:39,038
I have to get ready to defend myself.

1872
01:10:39,038 --> 01:10:40,172
(Let's say it's Kwang Soo.)

1873
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,274
Wait. You have to watch what you say.

1874
01:10:42,274 --> 01:10:44,710
The identity of the gold medalist can be narrowed.

1875
01:10:45,177 --> 01:10:46,245
You have to be careful.

1876
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:48,881
You have to be careful from now on. You have to be very careful.

1877
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,349
(I have to get Sang Yeob out.)

1878
01:10:50,349 --> 01:10:51,550
Oh, wait.

1879
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:54,920
(He has to take a picture of him to get him out.)

1880
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,055
Wait.

1881
01:10:56,455 --> 01:10:57,656
- Hey. - Wait.

1882
01:10:57,656 --> 01:10:59,191
(Where is he running?)

1883
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:02,828
(Coach Sang Yeob keeps on lurking around the scout list.)

1884
01:11:03,596 --> 01:11:07,666
(He sees a picture of Kwang Soo.)

1885
01:11:09,802 --> 01:11:11,570
I was going to take a picture of Da Hee,

1886
01:11:11,737 --> 01:11:13,506
but Sang Yeob was in the picture.

1887
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:14,907
I'll send that one.

1888
01:11:15,941 --> 01:11:17,309
(He accidentally took a photo of Sang Yeob.)

1889
01:11:17,309 --> 01:11:20,813
(He sends the picture over.)

1890
01:11:22,047 --> 01:11:23,382
Okay, it got sent.

1891
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:24,984
If I go back now, they're going to think it's me.

1892
01:11:24,984 --> 01:11:26,318
(There's no time.)

1893
01:11:27,019 --> 01:11:28,821
I have to get him out. I have to get Sang Yeob out.

1894
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:32,525
The gold medalist. That's the important thing.

1895
01:11:32,525 --> 01:11:34,727
(Meanwhile, Sang Yeob keeps on searching for the gold medalist.)

1896
01:11:35,027 --> 01:11:36,362
Can you go out that way as well?

1897
01:11:36,662 --> 01:11:37,863
Where were you?

1898
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:40,132
I went around this way.

1899
01:11:40,366 --> 01:11:41,700
(Se Chan and Haha are on full alert.)

1900
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,035
Why?

1901
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:44,937
Han Na is out.

1902
01:11:46,238 --> 01:11:47,573
Really?

1903
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,075
I can't hear the announcement in the hallway.

1904
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:52,044
(He acts obliviously.)

1905
01:11:53,712 --> 01:11:55,614
(Isn't he weird?)

1906
01:11:56,582 --> 01:11:57,816
There are three guys.

1907
01:11:57,816 --> 01:11:58,817
(It's him.)

1908
01:11:58,817 --> 01:12:01,253
- It's So Min... - Sang Yeob is weird.

1909
01:12:01,253 --> 01:12:04,089
It's So Min, Sang Yeob...

1910
01:12:04,089 --> 01:12:06,492
It's either Kwang Soo or Sang Yeob.

1911
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:08,327
Is it Sang Yeob then?

1912
01:12:08,327 --> 01:12:09,562
(I'll finish off...)

1913
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:12,398
(Coach B.)

1914
01:12:13,432 --> 01:12:14,600
Kwang Soo.

1915
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,703
(This voice is...)

1916
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:19,171
Kwang Soo.

1917
01:12:19,705 --> 01:12:22,474
(They finally meet.)

1918
01:12:24,043 --> 01:12:26,879
(Kwang Soo is ready...)

1919
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,349
(to prepare his innocence.)

1920
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:32,284
(If he gets Coach Sang Yeob out,)

1921
01:12:32,284 --> 01:12:35,621
(there will be only one coach left.)

1922
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:38,691
The gala show starts now.

1923
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:41,427
(The gala show...)

1924
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:44,530
(is starting?)

1925
01:12:44,663 --> 01:12:45,731
What?

1926
01:12:45,731 --> 01:12:48,300
(The invitation was found, and everything pauses now.)

1927
01:12:49,034 --> 01:12:51,637
(The coach is right in front of me.)

1928
01:12:52,037 --> 01:12:55,140
(Everybody stops and puts on blindfolds.)

1929
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:59,678
(The gala show has begun, and it'll provide important hints.)

1930
01:12:59,778 --> 01:13:01,814
(4 people can participate in the gala show.)

1931
01:13:01,814 --> 01:13:05,150
(From the 4 participants, the minority, whether it be...)

1932
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:08,554
(the coaches or the players, is out.)

1933
01:13:08,587 --> 01:13:11,724
(If there are 3 coaches and 1 player, the player is out.)

1934
01:13:11,724 --> 01:13:14,893
(If there are 3 players and 1 coach, the coach is out.)

1935
01:13:14,893 --> 01:13:16,862
(If there are 2 coaches and 2 players...)

1936
01:13:16,862 --> 01:13:21,100
(or all players, nothing happens.)

1937
01:13:21,166 --> 01:13:22,735
(Somebody just found...)

1938
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:24,970
(the gala show invitation.)

1939
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,572
All I needed was 10 seconds.

1940
01:13:27,873 --> 01:13:29,174
Please.

1941
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:32,378
I didn't know this would happen.

1942
01:13:33,846 --> 01:13:35,848
(Moments ago)

1943
01:13:36,515 --> 01:13:39,852
(The first person who found the invitation was Haha.)

1944
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:43,088
You must participate with one person of your choice.

1945
01:13:43,389 --> 01:13:45,557
Hold on. Let me come up with a strategy.

1946
01:13:45,557 --> 01:13:46,558
(The result of the gala show depends on whom he brings.)

1947
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:50,262
In any way, it has to be 3 to 1, right?

1948
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:51,764
Or four?

1949
01:13:51,764 --> 01:13:53,899
(There are two coaches left.)

1950
01:13:53,899 --> 01:13:58,404
(Sang Yeob is a strong candidate.)

1951
01:13:58,404 --> 01:14:03,042
(Sang Yeob was acting suspiciously, so Haha became certain.)

1952
01:14:03,342 --> 01:14:06,011
(So he decides to invite...)

1953
01:14:06,011 --> 01:14:07,246
Sang Yeob.

1954
01:14:07,246 --> 01:14:09,648
(So he decides to invite Sang Yeob, a strong candidate.)

1955
01:14:09,948 --> 01:14:14,253
(Gala show invitation list)

1956
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,089
(Jae Seok found the second invitation.)

1957
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:18,290
What's this?

1958
01:14:19,124 --> 01:14:21,160
You can pick one person,

1959
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,929
and we'll invite that person to the gala show.

1960
01:14:24,596 --> 01:14:28,934
(The person Jae Seok chose was...)

1961
01:14:30,536 --> 01:14:31,804
Se Chan.

1962
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:35,374
(In contrast to Haha, he picked somebody who is likely a player.)

1963
01:14:35,374 --> 01:14:37,543
(Gala show invitation list)

1964
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:40,579
(They have different plans. What will be the result?)

1965
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:43,482
We'll know once we see it.

1966
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:48,921
All four of you participated in the gala show.

1967
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:50,255
As I said before,

1968
01:14:50,255 --> 01:14:53,225
if there's more of one side,

1969
01:14:53,492 --> 01:14:56,028
the person on the lesser side will get eliminated.

1970
01:14:56,028 --> 01:14:57,396
(Sang Yeob will be out if he's the only coach.)

1971
01:14:57,396 --> 01:15:00,165
But if there's an equal split or if you're all players,

1972
01:15:00,165 --> 01:15:02,501
nothing will happen.

1973
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:05,170
(Nothing will happen if there are 2 players and 2 coaches.)

1974
01:15:05,237 --> 01:15:06,572
I'm getting goose bumps.

1975
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:09,141
(This is a golden opportunity to figure out Coach A's identity.)

1976
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:11,076
All right. According to the result of the gala show...

1977
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:12,478
(The result is revealed.)

1978
01:15:12,478 --> 01:15:13,979
The number of people who are out is...

1979
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:15,514
(The person who is out from these four...)

1980
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:17,316
The number of people who are out is...

1981
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:22,321
(Who is going to be out?)

1982
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:25,357
None.

1983
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,292
I got goose bumps.

1984
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:32,464
(Nothing happened.)

1985
01:15:32,464 --> 01:15:34,867
(Sang Yeob wasn't eliminated.)

1986
01:15:34,867 --> 01:15:36,135
Is there more to this?

1987
01:15:36,135 --> 01:15:37,336
That means...

1988
01:15:37,836 --> 01:15:40,873
there could be 2 coaches and 2 players...

1989
01:15:40,873 --> 01:15:42,341
What's going on?

1990
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:45,010
Or there could be four players.

1991
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,079
Wait. Who's left?

1992
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:48,447
Hold on.

1993
01:15:48,914 --> 01:15:50,282
See?

1994
01:15:50,516 --> 01:15:52,851
The trial has started.

1995
01:15:53,819 --> 01:15:54,987
(With the shocking result, the last trial begins.)

1996
01:15:54,987 --> 01:15:57,422
Please participate.

1997
01:15:57,422 --> 01:16:01,126
(Coaches versus players. Who will win?)

1998
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:04,029
(The last trial)

1999
01:16:04,029 --> 01:16:05,230
Nobody got out?

2000
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,266
- Come inside, and listen to me. - It's 2 and 2 then.

2001
01:16:07,266 --> 01:16:09,468
- Let's talk. - Nobody got out?

2002
01:16:09,701 --> 01:16:11,336
This is complicated.

2003
01:16:11,336 --> 01:16:12,738
Why? Why?

2004
01:16:12,838 --> 01:16:14,139
(There are less possibilities now but this is more complicated.)

2005
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:15,507
For this trial,

2006
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:18,544
you can discuss amongst yourselves and submit two names.

2007
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:20,646
Two people with the most votes will come up.

2008
01:16:20,646 --> 01:16:21,880
Okay.

2009
01:16:22,047 --> 01:16:23,949
Who has hints about the coaches?

2010
01:16:23,949 --> 01:16:27,286
Everybody, we shared all these,

2011
01:16:27,653 --> 01:16:31,690
but Coach A is a Running Man member in their 40s.

2012
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,593
From my point of view, that's either Jong Kook or Haha.

2013
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:37,629
- That's Jae Seok's point of view. - Yes, that's right.

2014
01:16:37,896 --> 01:16:40,933
Oh, gosh. I'm 40.

2015
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,368
The hint about Coach B...

2016
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:45,938
(The hints about Coach B point to Sang Yeob.)

2017
01:16:45,938 --> 01:16:48,373
- Near the end, Han Na got out. - Yes.

2018
01:16:48,373 --> 01:16:49,675
- It was a decisive hint. - It was a male.

2019
01:16:49,675 --> 01:16:52,911
Coach B is either Kwang Soo or Sang Yeob.

2020
01:16:53,478 --> 01:16:54,913
- Actor? Yes. - Right.

2021
01:16:54,913 --> 01:16:57,149
Then let's organize this.

2022
01:16:57,149 --> 01:16:59,084
The three people we are certain about should go there.

2023
01:16:59,117 --> 01:17:00,118
Me?

2024
01:17:00,118 --> 01:17:02,487
Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Jin Young are not it.

2025
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:03,989
- They're not coaches? - No.

2026
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:07,893
- And the suspects should come here. - Come here.

2027
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:09,494
Don't take this personally.

2028
01:17:09,494 --> 01:17:11,129
(I'll sit next to Se Chan.)

2029
01:17:11,129 --> 01:17:12,698
Come here. Kwang Soo, come here.

2030
01:17:12,698 --> 01:17:13,932
Don't go there, Kwang Soo.

2031
01:17:13,932 --> 01:17:15,267
(Kwang Soo,)

2032
01:17:15,267 --> 01:17:16,268
(where are you going?)

2033
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:18,670
- You belong here. - It's really not me.

2034
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,772
It's really not me. You want me to sit here?

2035
01:17:20,772 --> 01:17:22,507
- Sit here. - It's really not me.

2036
01:17:22,507 --> 01:17:23,642
- Come here. - You have to be here.

2037
01:17:23,642 --> 01:17:25,310
- Oh, gosh. What? - You have to be here.

2038
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:28,247
(In everyone's eyes, he's just a suspicious candidate.)

2039
01:17:28,413 --> 01:17:30,015
All right. We don't have much time.

2040
01:17:30,015 --> 01:17:32,017
- Hold on. - You're acting weirdly.

2041
01:17:32,017 --> 01:17:33,485
I'm the gold medalist.

2042
01:17:33,752 --> 01:17:34,820
What?

2043
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,456
- I'm the gold medalist. - All of a sudden?

2044
01:17:37,656 --> 01:17:39,124
(He reveals his identity since he's getting accused,)

2045
01:17:39,124 --> 01:17:40,859
(but others tell him off.)

2046
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:43,362
- Really? - All of a sudden?

2047
01:17:43,762 --> 01:17:46,331
- The gala show... - I got So Min out.

2048
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:48,000
There are no medalists here, right?

2049
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,935
- Who's a medalist here? - There are none. I told you.

2050
01:17:49,935 --> 01:17:51,570
It has to be Sang Yeob then.

2051
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,305
- Because... - It's not you then.

2052
01:17:53,405 --> 01:17:54,473
You, go there.

2053
01:17:54,473 --> 01:17:56,008
(If Kwang Soo is the medalist, Coach B has to be Sang Yeob.)

2054
01:17:56,975 --> 01:17:59,544
What I want to say now...

2055
01:17:59,778 --> 01:18:02,814
- is that I'm the gold medalist. - Wait.

2056
01:18:02,881 --> 01:18:05,384
Because this has to be certain.

2057
01:18:05,384 --> 01:18:08,420
- If you're the medalist... - How did you get So Min out?

2058
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:11,089
- We're all players. - How did you get So Min out?

2059
01:18:11,223 --> 01:18:12,491
How did you get So Min out?

2060
01:18:12,491 --> 01:18:13,659
(He asks Sang Yeob to testify.)

2061
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:17,129
- I got her out? - How did you get her out?

2062
01:18:17,129 --> 01:18:18,563
Did you say, "I got her out?"

2063
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:20,165
Isn't that what he's talking about?

2064
01:18:20,232 --> 01:18:22,200
Only the gold medalist can eliminate her.

2065
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,071
The gold medalist is supposed to get her out?

2066
01:18:26,672 --> 01:18:29,708
- You should go to jail. - Wait.

2067
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,109
That must have been a mistake.

2068
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:34,012
- Somebody got her by mistake. - Fine.

2069
01:18:34,012 --> 01:18:36,214
It's So Min, Sang Yeob, and Haha.

2070
01:18:36,214 --> 01:18:38,050
It's So Min, Sang Yeob, and Jae Seok.

2071
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,584
I'm serious.

2072
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:41,153
Sang Yeob is 100 percent.

2073
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,323
Do you have anything else?

2074
01:18:44,323 --> 01:18:47,092
- Jong Kook. - I'll reveal a hint about Coach A.

2075
01:18:47,092 --> 01:18:48,226
- Tell us. - Did you get one?

2076
01:18:48,226 --> 01:18:49,594
Here it is.

2077
01:18:49,928 --> 01:18:51,229
Coach A...

2078
01:18:51,229 --> 01:18:52,931
(These three are the candidates.)

2079
01:18:53,598 --> 01:18:56,234
- Coach A has a son. - He has a son?

2080
01:18:56,234 --> 01:18:57,936
(Coach A has a son?)

2081
01:18:58,537 --> 01:19:00,539
(20 minutes before trial)

2082
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:04,509
(Jong Kook found a decisive hint.)

2083
01:19:04,977 --> 01:19:07,245
Coach A has a son.

2084
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:09,848
(Coach A has a son.)

2085
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:13,018
(That's right. It's him.)

2086
01:19:13,018 --> 01:19:15,153
This is for certain. It's him.

2087
01:19:15,153 --> 01:19:18,090
(That excludes him too. This is a decisive hint.)

2088
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,659
- Coach A has a son. - He has a son?

2089
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:22,627
- It's either Haha or Jae Seok. - Yes.

2090
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:25,263
(That narrows down to 2 people for Coach A.)

2091
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:26,598
- Then... - Okay.

2092
01:19:26,598 --> 01:19:29,301
in my point of view, everything fits like a puzzle.

2093
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:30,902
- All right. - All right. I get it.

2094
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:33,038
- The son... - You have to share the information.

2095
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:35,007
Why are you playing solo?

2096
01:19:35,007 --> 01:19:36,808
(Are you here to solve mysteries for fun?)

2097
01:19:36,808 --> 01:19:39,778
You have to share the information. Share!

2098
01:19:39,811 --> 01:19:42,414
That's why... Hold on.

2099
01:19:42,414 --> 01:19:45,584
That's why the gala show was decisive.

2100
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:48,420
That's why the gala show... Gosh, it was decisive.

2101
01:19:48,487 --> 01:19:50,055
I know for sure too.

2102
01:19:50,055 --> 01:19:52,157
I went to the gala show.

2103
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,726
I am just an ordinary person.

2104
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:56,395
- Right. - Let me say something.

2105
01:19:56,395 --> 01:20:00,065
- Ordinary people change the world. - That's right. Please hear me out.

2106
01:20:00,065 --> 01:20:02,734
To whom did Jae Seok give the gala show invitation?

2107
01:20:02,734 --> 01:20:04,169
Me.

2108
01:20:05,203 --> 01:20:06,872
(Moments before the start of the gala show)

2109
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:11,009
- Jae Seok, did you invite me? - Yes. Of course.

2110
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,411
(Yes, of course.)

2111
01:20:12,644 --> 01:20:15,080
(Did Jae Seok know Se Chan was a player and invited him?)

2112
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,950
The important point is this. Why do you think I chose Se Chan?

2113
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:20,819
- Because you're not a coach. - You're a player.

2114
01:20:20,819 --> 01:20:22,521
I have to bring a player to be safe.

2115
01:20:22,521 --> 01:20:24,523
- Right, right. - One more.

2116
01:20:24,523 --> 01:20:27,159
- Haha brought Sang Yeob. - That's right.

2117
01:20:27,159 --> 01:20:29,327
Haha came and said this.

2118
01:20:29,327 --> 01:20:31,863
I didn't think this was important at first.

2119
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:33,198
"Haha, whom did you pick?"

2120
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:34,633
"Sang Yeob". "Why?"

2121
01:20:34,866 --> 01:20:36,101
"He's acting weirdly."

2122
01:20:36,101 --> 01:20:38,437
(Haha said Sang Yeob acted weirdly.)

2123
01:20:39,905 --> 01:20:41,440
Let's finish this quickly.

2124
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,275
- Who invited you, Haha? - Did you get the invitation?

2125
01:20:43,675 --> 01:20:45,343
- I picked somebody. - Whom did you pick?

2126
01:20:45,444 --> 01:20:46,778
Sang Yeob.

2127
01:20:47,379 --> 01:20:49,448
- Sang Yeob? - Yes, he's acting weirdly.

2128
01:20:50,582 --> 01:20:53,485
(In the same situation, Jae Seok and Haha made different choices.)

2129
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:56,655
There's a hole in this.

2130
01:20:56,788 --> 01:20:59,724
The weird person will pick another weird person.

2131
01:20:59,724 --> 01:21:02,060
If you think they're weird and you still bring them,

2132
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:05,030
that means you can fall into a trap.

2133
01:21:05,297 --> 01:21:10,302
No, because I was certain about Sang Yeob.

2134
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:13,338
My intention was if Sang Yeob...

2135
01:21:14,272 --> 01:21:18,009
Because we're all players, right? He'll be eliminated.

2136
01:21:18,009 --> 01:21:20,412
(If Haha took Coach Sang Yeob, Sang Yeob would be out.)

2137
01:21:20,412 --> 01:21:22,481
- He'll be eliminated. But... - Right.

2138
01:21:22,481 --> 01:21:23,949
(If there were three players, Sang Yeob would've been out.)

2139
01:21:23,949 --> 01:21:25,750
If either he or I...

2140
01:21:26,284 --> 01:21:29,788
- is a coach, it'll be a tie. - Right.

2141
01:21:29,788 --> 01:21:31,056
(Even if there were two coaches, it'd be a tie.)

2142
01:21:31,056 --> 01:21:33,091
If either he or I is a coach, it'll be a tie.

2143
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:35,193
(The players will not get eliminated.)

2144
01:21:35,193 --> 01:21:38,096
I had nothing to lose. It was a test too.

2145
01:21:38,096 --> 01:21:39,397
No, that's not true.

2146
01:21:39,798 --> 01:21:43,401
- To be honest, both makes sense. - You're right.

2147
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:45,570
This is driving me crazy.

2148
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:47,706
- My point is this. - This is way too easy.

2149
01:21:47,706 --> 01:21:49,541
If Jae Seok was a coach, he wouldn't have invited me.

2150
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:50,976
- Exactly. - Because...

2151
01:21:50,976 --> 01:21:52,944
if he was a coach, he had the risk...

2152
01:21:52,944 --> 01:21:54,146
- of getting eliminated. - Exactly.

2153
01:21:54,146 --> 01:21:55,814
- You guys are so frustrating. - This is...

2154
01:21:55,814 --> 01:21:58,383
so obvious. The answer's already so clear.

2155
01:21:58,683 --> 01:22:00,685
But Haha also has a point.

2156
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:02,521
- Seriously. - It was a safe bet for him.

2157
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:04,289
- Exactly. - Because...

2158
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:06,158
- So Min got eliminated. - He was testing the waters.

2159
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:09,494
That doesn't make any sense. He could've gotten me eliminated.

2160
01:22:09,494 --> 01:22:12,330
Okay, it's time to vote.

2161
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,432
- This is insane. - This is...

2162
01:22:14,432 --> 01:22:15,800
This is really driving me crazy.

2163
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,169
I'll just trust my instinct.

2164
01:22:17,169 --> 01:22:19,871
- Seriously. - We just held a small meeting.

2165
01:22:19,871 --> 01:22:22,240
- I'm suspicious of him as well. - A and B are so obvious.

2166
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,341
It's Sang Yeob and Haha.

2167
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:26,178
I'll repeat what he just said but with a different name.

2168
01:22:26,178 --> 01:22:27,445
It's exactly the same.

2169
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,681
- Everyone. - Pay attention.

2170
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:31,049
- You need to concentrate. - Seriously.

2171
01:22:31,049 --> 01:22:32,450
I'm being really serious right now.

2172
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,985
- I'm serious too, everyone. - Yes.

2173
01:22:33,985 --> 01:22:35,820
- I'm being sincere. - Let me repeat myself.

2174
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,289
- Don't end up regretting. - Trust me.

2175
01:22:37,289 --> 01:22:40,292
Come on. We're almost there.

2176
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:42,761
(They finish voting.)

2177
01:22:42,761 --> 01:22:44,696
If the gold medalist gets eliminated,

2178
01:22:44,696 --> 01:22:46,598
the players will end up losing.

2179
01:22:46,598 --> 01:22:49,501
And it'll be the same if you fail to catch the remaining two coaches.

2180
01:22:49,501 --> 01:22:51,503
(Team Coach loses if both Coach A and Sang Yeob are caught.)

2181
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:53,905
(The winning team will get the Luxury Stickers,)

2182
01:22:53,905 --> 01:22:56,074
(and the losing team will get the Shuddering Stickers.)

2183
01:22:56,074 --> 01:22:57,709
Gosh, this is such a close bet.

2184
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:00,445
The first candidate got seven votes.

2185
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:02,480
(The candidate who got the highest number of votes)

2186
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,548
Lee Sang Yeob.

2187
01:23:03,548 --> 01:23:05,250
- See? - Sang Yeob is definitely a coach.

2188
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,985
(A single mistake has led him to get eliminated.)

2189
01:23:06,985 --> 01:23:08,186
- Almost everyone... - Everyone voted for him.

2190
01:23:08,186 --> 01:23:11,056
That means even a coach voted for you so that he could live.

2191
01:23:11,156 --> 01:23:12,290
I know.

2192
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:15,560
The 2nd and 3rd candidates each received...

2193
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:18,063
4 and 3 votes. It was a close match.

2194
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:20,098
(The 2nd and 3rd candidates only had a difference of 1 vote.)

2195
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:22,801
(This is crazy.)

2196
01:23:23,535 --> 01:23:25,237
- Just one vote? - That's so close.

2197
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:26,238
(There's only a difference of one vote.)

2198
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:27,505
The one who got four votes...

2199
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,176
(The teams' results depend on that one vote.)

2200
01:23:31,676 --> 01:23:34,779
(Please don't let it be the other coach.)

2201
01:23:34,779 --> 01:23:36,982
(Who will join Sang Yeob?)

2202
01:23:36,982 --> 01:23:38,550
Haha got 4 votes, and Jae Seok got 3 votes.

2203
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,684
- Haha, please come up here. - Okay.

2204
01:23:39,684 --> 01:23:40,952
(Haha gets 4 votes.)

2205
01:23:41,186 --> 01:23:42,721
(He's shocked.)

2206
01:23:42,721 --> 01:23:44,689
- That one vote saved me. - My gosh.

2207
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:46,324
(Their destiny gets divided due to a single vote.)

2208
01:23:46,491 --> 01:23:48,793
(He can't believe Haha got voted out.)

2209
01:23:48,793 --> 01:23:49,928
Who...

2210
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:51,429
- See? - My gosh.

2211
01:23:51,429 --> 01:23:54,165
That means one of you voted for me.

2212
01:23:54,165 --> 01:23:55,567
This is crazy.

2213
01:23:55,567 --> 01:23:57,202
- My gosh. - But it's still a relief.

2214
01:23:57,302 --> 01:23:59,037
- I'm so relieved. - Who voted for Haha?

2215
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:00,939
Why can't you guys tell?

2216
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:02,440
- You voted for me, didn't you? - No way.

2217
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,142
- Was it you? - They both voted for Haha.

2218
01:24:04,142 --> 01:24:05,343
You guys voted for Haha?

2219
01:24:06,077 --> 01:24:07,245
Let's just get the penalty.

2220
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:09,948
- We did it. We're done. - Who did this?

2221
01:24:09,948 --> 01:24:11,082
Who voted for Haha?

2222
01:24:11,283 --> 01:24:13,418
- You voted for me, didn't you? - Of course.

2223
01:24:13,418 --> 01:24:16,521
He's definitely a coach. I just didn't point him out.

2224
01:24:16,521 --> 01:24:17,789
You're so stupid!

2225
01:24:17,889 --> 01:24:19,090
Are you serious?

2226
01:24:19,724 --> 01:24:21,693
Let's just get the penalty.

2227
01:24:22,227 --> 01:24:25,163
Let's check their identities.

2228
01:24:25,163 --> 01:24:28,166
1, 2, 3.

2229
01:24:28,166 --> 01:24:30,001
(What are they?)

2230
01:24:31,603 --> 01:24:34,005
(Sang Yeob is definitely a coach.)

2231
01:24:34,072 --> 01:24:35,540
You completely got fooled.

2232
01:24:36,207 --> 01:24:38,710
(Both teams depend on Haha.)

2233
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,313
(Is Haha a coach or a player?)

2234
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,381
(Coach)

2235
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:46,151
(Haha was also a coach.)

2236
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:47,886
See? I told you.

2237
01:24:48,219 --> 01:24:50,155
(Team Players wins for having caught both coaches.)

2238
01:24:50,155 --> 01:24:51,189
He was a coach?

2239
01:24:51,189 --> 01:24:52,824
- They're both coaches. - Nice!

2240
01:24:52,824 --> 01:24:55,026
- Are you serious? - I told you so.

2241
01:24:55,026 --> 01:24:57,162
(What a pity.)

2242
01:24:58,196 --> 01:25:00,465
(I'm a player.)

2243
01:25:01,366 --> 01:25:02,701
Good job.

2244
01:25:03,468 --> 01:25:04,669
That was so close.

2245
01:25:04,769 --> 01:25:06,338
I can't believe this.

2246
01:25:07,005 --> 01:25:09,240
We were so close!

2247
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:10,975
(He tried his best to survive, but he lost by just one vote.)

2248
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:12,310
I'm so angry.

2249
01:25:14,212 --> 01:25:17,148
You guys are coaches, and you're holding a grudge against...

2250
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:20,618
the players for having turned down your offer to train them.

2251
01:25:20,618 --> 01:25:22,187
Right. How could I forget?

2252
01:25:22,187 --> 01:25:23,555
(He starts acting right away.)

2253
01:25:24,289 --> 01:25:26,191
- Seriously. - No one accepted my offer.

2254
01:25:26,191 --> 01:25:27,325
I know.

2255
01:25:27,325 --> 01:25:29,594
I really got so angry. I'm serious.

2256
01:25:29,594 --> 01:25:31,696
I was about to quit coaching.

2257
01:25:31,696 --> 01:25:33,898
(Role-playing as the spy is so fun.)

2258
01:25:34,566 --> 01:25:36,501
People might doubt So Min,

2259
01:25:36,501 --> 01:25:37,936
but they'll never doubt me.

2260
01:25:37,936 --> 01:25:39,304
- They won't doubt me. - Really?

2261
01:25:39,304 --> 01:25:40,405
I failed so many times.

2262
01:25:40,405 --> 01:25:41,673
I heard you're like a drain.

2263
01:25:41,673 --> 01:25:42,974
(I heard you're like a drain.)

2264
01:25:42,974 --> 01:25:44,542
- A drain? - You're the worst spy ever.

2265
01:25:44,542 --> 01:25:45,710
- I know. - Because she fails?

2266
01:25:45,710 --> 01:25:47,879
- Yes, that's it. - It's true though.

2267
01:25:47,879 --> 01:25:50,248
- I heard she's really bad. - It's true.

2268
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:51,349
I heard that about her.

2269
01:25:51,349 --> 01:25:53,151
I'll be working with amateurs.

2270
01:25:54,085 --> 01:25:56,321
- Don't worry, I'll be... - This is the worst.

2271
01:25:56,621 --> 01:25:59,391
- How will they get hints? - I'll surprise you today.

2272
01:25:59,391 --> 01:26:01,860
- This combination is funny. - I won't let you down.

2273
01:26:02,694 --> 01:26:04,028
But it's the worst.

2274
01:26:04,763 --> 01:26:07,465
(Haha had already prepared himself for the worst.)

2275
01:26:07,565 --> 01:26:12,537
(He started framing others.)

2276
01:26:12,537 --> 01:26:16,307
(He made people like him by acting naively.)

2277
01:26:16,374 --> 01:26:18,910
(He tried so hard to survive.)

2278
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:21,546
- I'm the gold medalist. - You?

2279
01:26:21,813 --> 01:26:24,749
(But So Min got eliminated by lying to the real gold medalist.)

2280
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,651
I'm the gold medalist.

2281
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:29,854
(Sang Yeob made a sudden move after feeling threatened,)

2282
01:26:29,854 --> 01:26:32,424
(but he got caught for not knowing the rules properly.)

2283
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:35,627
(They both ended up making mistakes just like amateurs.)

2284
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:39,664
(I can't believe we lost by just one vote.)

2285
01:26:40,498 --> 01:26:42,100
But I really...

2286
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:44,969
The coaches were Haha, Sang Yeob, and So Min.

2287
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,771
Are we three getting the stickers?

2288
01:26:46,771 --> 01:26:48,807
I already have two of those.

2289
01:26:48,807 --> 01:26:49,974
We could've won.

2290
01:26:49,974 --> 01:26:52,577
And Kwang Soo, who performed greatly as the gold medalist,

2291
01:26:52,577 --> 01:26:54,312
will get a Luxury Sticker.

2292
01:26:54,579 --> 01:26:56,881
Good job, Kwang Soo.

2293
01:26:56,881 --> 01:26:58,450
So Min will end up going no matter what.

2294
01:26:58,450 --> 01:26:59,617
(The coaches and the gold medalist get their designated stickers.)

2295
01:26:59,617 --> 01:27:01,719
- Sang Yeob's almost settled to go. - I know.

2296
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:03,254
- But... - However,

2297
01:27:03,388 --> 01:27:06,357
the Shuddering Sticker slot needs three more people.

2298
01:27:06,357 --> 01:27:07,492
Exactly.

2299
01:27:07,592 --> 01:27:08,760
- What? - Do we choose?

2300
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,128
Please bring out the briefcases.

2301
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:11,596
- Again? - There's more?

2302
01:27:11,596 --> 01:27:13,765
- This is insane. - Not all of you will be safe.

2303
01:27:13,765 --> 01:27:15,900
- This is... - I can't believe this.

2304
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:18,036
There are eight briefcases.

2305
01:27:18,036 --> 01:27:21,272
And three of them have Shuddering Stickers inside.

2306
01:27:21,272 --> 01:27:22,674
(3 out of 8 briefcases have Shuddering Stickers inside.)

2307
01:27:22,674 --> 01:27:24,108
We'll find out who gets to go.

2308
01:27:24,776 --> 01:27:27,245
The ones who voted for Jae Seok should pick first.

2309
01:27:27,245 --> 01:27:28,947
- That's a good idea. - Let's do that.

2310
01:27:28,947 --> 01:27:31,950
Haha, I still remember.

2311
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:34,586
- You almost got it. - You can go ahead and open them.

2312
01:27:34,586 --> 01:27:35,787
- Jong Kook, open it. - Okay.

2313
01:27:35,787 --> 01:27:37,555
(I almost made a big mistake today.)

2314
01:27:39,357 --> 01:27:40,992
(What? Luxury Package?)

2315
01:27:40,992 --> 01:27:43,862
It's the Luxury Package. My gosh.

2316
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:46,464
(This is ridiculous.)

2317
01:27:46,798 --> 01:27:49,701
- He's so lucky. - This is absurd.

2318
01:27:50,268 --> 01:27:52,170
- I'm sorry. - He's so lucky.

2319
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:54,405
This is all thanks to you. You did well today.

2320
01:27:54,873 --> 01:27:56,441
I can't believe he got that.

2321
01:27:56,441 --> 01:27:58,276
- I'm sorry. - Seriously?

2322
01:27:58,276 --> 01:27:59,777
This is just how things turned out.

2323
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:01,045
You need to...

2324
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:02,080
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

2325
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,982
I hope you get the Shuddering Package.

2326
01:28:03,982 --> 01:28:06,584
(He picked the briefcase with the Shuddering Package.)

2327
01:28:06,951 --> 01:28:07,986
(Se Chan always ends up being pitiful.)

2328
01:28:07,986 --> 01:28:10,488
What's wrong? What is it?

2329
01:28:10,822 --> 01:28:12,023
My gosh.

2330
01:28:12,524 --> 01:28:15,059
I was told to go home all day.

2331
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:17,228
And I doubted the wrong person.

2332
01:28:17,395 --> 01:28:19,364
I run over to Jong Kook whenever he calls me.

2333
01:28:19,397 --> 01:28:20,899
And I go when he tells me to go.

2334
01:28:21,065 --> 01:28:23,167
I really enjoyed your company today.

2335
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:24,369
Se Chan, stick your name on the board.

2336
01:28:24,536 --> 01:28:26,104
There are two more people left.

2337
01:28:27,272 --> 01:28:28,706
There are only two more?

2338
01:28:28,973 --> 01:28:30,575
That's 4 against 2.

2339
01:28:30,575 --> 01:28:32,343
- Let's take one each. - Yes, let's do that.

2340
01:28:32,343 --> 01:28:33,344
- Let's go. - Okay.

2341
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:35,713
(The remaining 6 each choose a briefcase.)

2342
01:28:35,914 --> 01:28:38,483
Let's all take turns opening them. Han Na, you go first.

2343
01:28:38,483 --> 01:28:40,285
Okay. I hope I get the Luxury Package.

2344
01:28:40,285 --> 01:28:42,487
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2345
01:28:42,487 --> 01:28:45,256
- You need to unlock it first. - It's locked.

2346
01:28:45,256 --> 01:28:47,559
(She was trying to open it when it was still locked.)

2347
01:28:47,559 --> 01:28:49,060
- Wait. - You need to unlock it.

2348
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,128
- Come on. - She's unbelievable.

2349
01:28:50,128 --> 01:28:51,429
(Her briefcase opening skills are as bad as her problem-solving skills.)

2350
01:28:51,429 --> 01:28:53,031
- She's unbelivable. - It's the other way around.

2351
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:54,766
- She's a little off. - Like this?

2352
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:56,067
- Like this? - Yes.

2353
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:58,236
Okay. In 1, 2, 3.

2354
01:28:58,236 --> 01:29:00,171
- My gosh. - No, come on.

2355
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:01,439
In 1, 2, 3.

2356
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:04,008
(She's using one hand to open it and the other hand to close it.)

2357
01:29:04,342 --> 01:29:05,577
- That's not it. - What's wrong?

2358
01:29:05,577 --> 01:29:06,611
You need to open it like this.

2359
01:29:06,611 --> 01:29:08,580
(This moment is supposed to be very tense.)

2360
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,181
- You need to hold it like this. - Oh, okay.

2361
01:29:10,181 --> 01:29:12,684
She probably voted for Jong Kook instead of me.

2362
01:29:12,684 --> 01:29:13,785
Yes, probably.

2363
01:29:13,785 --> 01:29:15,286
I think I picked the wrong one.

2364
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:16,287
- Open it. - Come on.

2365
01:29:16,287 --> 01:29:17,889
- In 1, 2, 3. - In, 1, 2, 3.

2366
01:29:18,256 --> 01:29:19,824
- She got the Shuddering Package. - My gosh.

2367
01:29:19,824 --> 01:29:21,092
Oh, gosh.

2368
01:29:21,092 --> 01:29:22,527
(She opened it the wrong way and got the Shuddering Package.)

2369
01:29:23,294 --> 01:29:24,462
- She got the Shuddering Package. - My gosh.

2370
01:29:24,462 --> 01:29:26,564
(She ends the day with the Shuddering Package.)

2371
01:29:26,564 --> 01:29:27,899
She got the Shuddering Package.

2372
01:29:28,366 --> 01:29:29,367
(There are 5 people remaining.)

2373
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:30,768
- There's just 1 more ticket. - There's 1 more.

2374
01:29:30,768 --> 01:29:32,170
I can't believe she got that.

2375
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:33,271
It's so funny.

2376
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:34,639
In 1, 2, 3.

2377
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:36,841
I got the Luxury Package.

2378
01:29:37,175 --> 01:29:38,710
In 1, 2, 3.

2379
01:29:39,177 --> 01:29:41,813
(Even Da Hee ends up getting the Luxury Package.)

2380
01:29:42,213 --> 01:29:43,948
- She got the Luxury Package. - My gosh.

2381
01:29:44,148 --> 01:29:46,084
- Oh, please. - It's 1 of you 3.

2382
01:29:46,451 --> 01:29:49,020
(One of them will be getting the Shuddering Package.)

2383
01:29:49,554 --> 01:29:52,056
Jae Seok, change briefcases.

2384
01:29:52,056 --> 01:29:53,358
Take Ji Hyo's.

2385
01:29:53,725 --> 01:29:55,793
Take Ji Hyo's. Exchange your briefcases.

2386
01:29:55,793 --> 01:29:57,395
- Why? - What?

2387
01:29:57,528 --> 01:29:59,263
- Why? - What?

2388
01:29:59,263 --> 01:30:00,698
Let him have yours.

2389
01:30:00,765 --> 01:30:02,166
No reason.

2390
01:30:02,166 --> 01:30:04,068
- I feel sorry for him. - No, I don't want to change.

2391
01:30:04,068 --> 01:30:05,169
No, I don't want to change.

2392
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:06,771
- Really? - Then let's keep going.

2393
01:30:06,771 --> 01:30:08,072
- Let's go. - Keep going.

2394
01:30:08,072 --> 01:30:10,842
I feel like there might be feces inside Jae Seok's briefcase.

2395
01:30:10,975 --> 01:30:12,477
There might be a huge feces.

2396
01:30:12,477 --> 01:30:14,045
- Open them all at once. - Really?

2397
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:15,680
- You're not going to change it? - No.

2398
01:30:15,847 --> 01:30:17,081
- All at once. - In one,

2399
01:30:17,615 --> 01:30:19,450
- 2... - 3.

2400
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:23,521
(Who will end up getting the Shuddering Sticker?)

2401
01:30:24,288 --> 01:30:25,423
Three.

2402
01:30:26,557 --> 01:30:28,059
(Ji Hyo ends up getting the Shuddering Sticker.)

2403
01:30:28,059 --> 01:30:29,193
- It's the Luxury Package. - Ji Hyo got it.

2404
01:30:30,028 --> 01:30:31,229
It's Ji Hyo.

2405
01:30:33,031 --> 01:30:36,601
(The briefcase she almost gave away had the Shuddering Sticker inside.)

2406
01:30:36,934 --> 01:30:38,069
(I'm glad I didn't get it.)

2407
01:30:38,069 --> 01:30:40,471
- She should've switched briefcases. - You should've switched.

2408
01:30:40,471 --> 01:30:41,472
(Jae Seok should've gotten it.)

2409
01:30:41,472 --> 01:30:42,573
You should've switched.

2410
01:30:42,573 --> 01:30:44,509
- I feel so sorry for her. - My gosh.

2411
01:30:44,509 --> 01:30:46,978
I almost even considered switching briefcases.

2412
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:51,082
But I didn't because Ji Hyo got angry

2413
01:30:51,082 --> 01:30:53,685
I figured I shouldn't bother her

2414
01:30:53,685 --> 01:30:55,086
(What a great day.)

2415
01:30:55,086 --> 01:30:56,921
- You should've switched. - Can we pick again?

2416
01:30:57,255 --> 01:30:58,656
(The Family Package Project has come to an end.)

2417
01:30:59,323 --> 01:31:01,292
- I got the Luxury Package. - I can't believe...

2418
01:31:01,292 --> 01:31:02,660
I got the Luxury Package.

2419
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:05,730
(2nd Week Results, Luxury Package, Shuddering Package)
