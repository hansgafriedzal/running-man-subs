1
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:11,093
- Hello.
- Hi, hi.

2
00:00:11,093 --> 00:00:13,003
- Hello.
- Hi.

3
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,603
- Hi.
- Hi.

4
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:16,779
Hello, Si Hyun. You're here today.

5
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,679
- Hello.
- Hi, everyone.

6
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:20,808
(Wait. What's that?)

7
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:22,608
- Can you film his bottom?
- Hi.

8
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:24,348
(Cameramen, can you film his bottom?)

9
00:00:24,348 --> 00:00:26,179
(His pants are sagging today.)

10
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:27,788
- Look at his bottom.
- Hold on. Look at this.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,788
- Come on.
- Show it to them just once.

12
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:31,988
- Show it to the viewers.
- Why would I do that?

13
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,859
- Look at your bottom.
- These are just pants.

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:34,888
Your pants look weird.

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,458
I don't know if I have to pull up the pants or lower them.

16
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,299
- They are baggy pants, - Those are baggy pants.

17
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:40,399
But his pants are too tight.

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,998
- Take a photo.
- They are baggy pants.

19
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,738
Why are you taking a photo?

20
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,369
It's because your bottom isn't curvy.

21
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:47,238
My bottom isn't the problem. It's the pants.

22
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:48,609
What is it?

23
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:50,939
Hold on. Is the problem with the design?

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:51,939
Or is it your body?

25
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,479
(What's the problem here?)

26
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,278
- It's him. His bottom isn't curvy.
- The pants are designed this way,

27
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:56,479
- It's not that. - and his body doesn't suit it.

28
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,678
- His bottom isn't perky.
- They aren't curvy at all.

29
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,619
(Both the design and his figure are the problem.)

30
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:03,388
There's this thing inside his pants. Look.

31
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:05,228
- I wore a diaper just in case.
- What's this?

32
00:01:05,859 --> 00:01:08,458
I think he was trying to cover up that his bottom was flat.

33
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,228
- Put pads on your bottom.
- Yes, you should wear those.

34
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,598
- We wear that for the colonoscopy.
- Hey.

35
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,969
Don't pay attention to my pants.

36
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:17,969
- Your pants are delaying the shoot.
- Stop that!

37
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,609
- Why did you wear baggy pants?
- My gosh.

38
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,568
- You're unbelievable.
- The string is thin too.

39
00:01:21,568 --> 00:01:24,139
Kwang Soo, hold on a second.

40
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:25,939
(The shape... What... What?)

41
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:27,779
- They are yellow.
- My gosh, the pants.

42
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,178
- What's wrong with my pants?
- Hey.

43
00:01:29,178 --> 00:01:31,079
(What did the pants look like?)

44
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,988
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with my pants?

45
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:34,388
Lower the pants, will you? My gosh.

46
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:36,419
- What should I do?
- Hey.

47
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:37,889
- It looked weird.
- Hold on.

48
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,788
We wear those pants when we undergo the colonoscopy.

49
00:01:39,788 --> 00:01:40,788
Hey.

50
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,898
- What should I do?
- It's not that.

51
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,258
Kwang Soo, you should tie it here.

52
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,799
- How?
- Tie it in the back.

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
We'll tie it with a rubber band.

54
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:50,038
- Let's tie it.
- Hey, you should tie it.

55
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,898
- Right here.
- There you go.

56
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:54,508
- Why did you wear this pair?
- This is it.

57
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:57,579
- You shouldn't have worn them.
- That's a good idea, Jae Seok.

58
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,848
- He really is high-maintenance.
- That's perfect.

59
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:01,708
- Look what I did for you.
- It's all done now.

60
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,878
(He unexpectedly acquires a tail.)

61
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:04,878
- Is it okay? Thank you, Jae Seok.
- It worked.

62
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,519
(My gosh, let me touch it.)

63
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,188
- Look. Look at that.
- It looks good now.

64
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:09,718
- What is this?
- It's all done now.

65
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:11,789
- It's good now.
- What's up with my pants?

66
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,158
- It's finished now.
- Hey.

67
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,428
Being his stylist is a hard job.

68
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:17,898
Seok Jin dressed too young for his age.

69
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:18,958
- This is too much.
- Now, I am...

70
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,729
Don't you think pink is too much for your age?

71
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:22,269
- No, no.
- Isn't that your son's?

72
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,069
I want to wear outfits that make me look young instead of handsome.

73
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,069
That's my focus.

74
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,968
At this rate, he will wear baby clothes.

75
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,579
(Following your logic, you'll end up in baby clothes soon.)

76
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:31,879
Seok Jin, how young do you want to look?

77
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,449
- Seok Jin.
- Seok Jin.

78
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,808
- If you want to do that...
- Later, his wife will...

79
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,879
wrap him up in a blanket.

80
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,278
(He will be wrapped with a blanket.)

81
00:02:38,278 --> 00:02:41,049
"Hello, I know that he has to film today."

82
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:43,218
"I brought him."

83
00:02:43,218 --> 00:02:45,519
During the breaks, she will change his diaper.

84
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,799
(Changing diapers during breaks)

85
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,289
(Seok Jin's time goes backward.)

86
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:51,498
- Okay.
- Give him baby clothes.

87
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:53,099
- I wouldn't look good in those.
- Get them in pink.

88
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,398
- Baby clothes don't have pants.
- Come again?

89
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:57,898
(What? That came out of nowhere.)

90
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:59,169
- Why wouldn't there be pants?
- Probably not.

91
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:01,908
- Why do you think about that stuff?
- It's not that.

92
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:03,778
- I was just curious about them.
- My gosh.

93
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:06,449
- Right? There are no pants.
- He can wear the diaper.

94
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,879
(Actually, there are no pants.)

95
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,319
Before we wrap up the Family Package Project,

96
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,088
- it's a break week.
- That's why...

97
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,849
- the others aren't here.
- We'll have a break.

98
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,058
Sang Yeob and I exchange text messages every other day.

99
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,488
- My gosh.
- He's so talkative.

100
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:23,859
- It was due to the scheduling.
- They wanted to come today.

101
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,158
- They are actor and actresses.
- Right. Today, we will take...

102
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,629
a break and have TV Rating Notice Race Part Two.

103
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:29,968
(TV Rating Notice Race Part 2)

104
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:31,599
It's about time.

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,599
- Yes, please!
- Yes, let's change that!

106
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,238
- It lasted longer than I thought.
- This is great.

107
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:36,598
- Yes, it lasted quite long.
- It lasted more than a month.

108
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,479
(Jae Seok won the chance to direct the first TV rating notice.)

109
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:45,419
(He directed his TV rating notice with animals and sea creatures.)

110
00:03:45,748 --> 00:03:48,188
The current one is great. Why would we change that?

111
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:50,958
I keep missing the opening segment because I don't want to see that.

112
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,789
Seriously. I don't want to watch that notice.

113
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:54,958
- It comes up again midway.
- Exactly. Right?

114
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,699
I get called an idiot every week.

115
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,799
- It's in the clip.
- Right. That's right.

116
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,329
That's the only thing I hear from the notice.

117
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,398
The part two of the TV rating notice is called Have a Nice Day.

118
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:05,799
(Have a Nice Day)

119
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:09,009
Since it's part two, we've improved the race.

120
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:11,129
Not only will you get to direct the five-second clip,

121
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,248
but you'll also handle the poster and photo on our official website.

122
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,079
- Even the photo on the website?
- That's a lot.

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,954
The same photo will be used for the website, right?

124
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,489
- It will be our official photo.
- That's great.

125
00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,389
We'll distribute the posters all over the TV station too.

126
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:25,489
Can you throw in one more?

127
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:27,259
(One more, please.)

128
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:28,829
When the preview airs,

129
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,329
can't you add, "So and So's Running Man" in it?

130
00:04:31,329 --> 00:04:33,298
- No, they can't do that.
- That's being greedy.

131
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:35,305
- Right. That's asking too much.
- People think it's Jae Seok's.

132
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:37,968
It could be, "Haha's Running Man" or "Seok Jin's Running Man".

133
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,538
- Haha is trying too hard.
- Haha, cut it out.

134
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,139
Shouldn't we try harder?

135
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,679
Haha.

136
00:04:43,778 --> 00:04:46,038
Don't overdo yourself because you lost a weekend-show.

137
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:49,848
(Don't overdo yourself because you lost a weekend-show.)

138
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:52,319
- Just carry on like usual.
- He wanted to spice things up.

139
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,348
Haha, don't feel hasty.

140
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,489
"Don't feel hasty."

141
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,458
You already feel anxious?

142
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,209
What's wrong with him today? It's making me uncomfortable.

143
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,489
- Hey, take it slow.
- He's making it uneasy for me.

144
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,229
Don't show them your weak side.

145
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:04,999
- What is this?
- Rest on Saturdays.

146
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:07,829
Just for a while. Just rest for a while.

147
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,598
- Keep your chin up!
- I'll keep my chin up!

148
00:05:09,598 --> 00:05:10,699
I can do this!

149
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,699
(I'll keep my chin up. I can do this!)

150
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,538
(Our challenge...)

151
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:16,778
(can be put on hold for a while.)

152
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,548
I saw Jun Ha in passing. I only smelled meat on his hands.

153
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,708
He's been having a lot of barbecue.

154
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,619
Why are they doing this on this show?

155
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,949
- I have a problem with Haha.
- What is it?

156
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,588
We do a lot of businesses together.

157
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:32,559
I feel like his value is decreasing.

158
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:35,559
- Really? But he's on Running Man.
- Even so.

159
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,028
If Jong Kook feels this way...

160
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,869
I mean, he loves Haha unconditionally.

161
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:43,098
- His value seems to be decreasing.
- My gosh.

162
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:46,509
You will have two rounds of missions today.

163
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:49,639
After the missions, the winner will win the TV rating notice trio and...

164
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,179
- direct however they want.
- This is great. Great!

165
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,679
Before we start the race,

166
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,879
you will come up with your own storyboards...

167
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,278
- and present them.
- We have to do that again?

168
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,588
- Right, we should do that.
- With the clip, I brought fame...

169
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:02,119
- to Ji Hyo and Haha.
- What are you talking about?

170
00:06:02,788 --> 00:06:05,989
(Haha was Toshio, and Ji Hyo was Kaonashi. They became stars?)

171
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,858
- She was Kaonashi.
- Me? Me?

172
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:09,528
I turned you into stars with the notice.

173
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:10,798
- Thank you!
- No problem.

174
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,429
(Thank you, Jae Seok!)

175
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,528
(I did it for you, punk.)

176
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:14,898
- That's enough.
- Don't be weird.

177
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,898
Why do you keep hugging each other?

178
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:18,168
(We don't need to rush.)

179
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,309
I can do this. I can do this.

180
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,139
That was great. Well done.

181
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,439
- Right.
- That was good.

182
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:26,478
- Whenever he hugs you, - Kwang Soo.

183
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:28,348
- Your value increases.
- Is that so?

184
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:31,379
(Is it because of Jae Seok's influence?)

185
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,449
Come on.

186
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,218
- Hug him. Hug him often.
- What are you talking about?

187
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:35,689
- You're unbelievable.
- "Hug him."

188
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:37,588
- Hold my hands. Hold them.
- Hug him. Hug him often.

189
00:06:37,588 --> 00:06:38,865
(Riding his coattail is the best.)

190
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,158
Then should we go draw?

191
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:41,329
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

192
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:42,588
What should I draw?

193
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:44,999
- Can we search things online?
- Sorry?

194
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,398
- We can use the Internet?
- Of course, we can.

195
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:48,468
You can do whatever you want.

196
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:51,199
So Min, you're not scheduled to be in a film or a drama, right?

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,668
No, why?

198
00:06:52,869 --> 00:06:55,009
- I thought about cutting your hair.
- No, you can't.

199
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:56,778
- No, no.
- Are you on a project?

200
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:57,978
What did you say? Cut my hair?

201
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,679
We won't be using a wig. You will really have your hair cut.

202
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,179
You will really cut my hair?

203
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:03,449
You can't use a wig.

204
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:05,778
Okay, fine. Are you good with shaving your head?

205
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:07,389
(Okay, fine. Are you good with shaving your head?)

206
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,319
- Let's do this.
- So Min.

207
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,158
The Chinese queue would be funny. The Chinese queue.

208
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,989
- We can spell R with it.
- He will have hair on the back.

209
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:14,728
- He will have hair up to here.
- Right.

210
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,028
I'll just have hair in the back? Okay.

211
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:19,728
How about just poop?

212
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:20,728
Poop?

213
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,499
- Poop?
- With my hair?

214
00:07:22,968 --> 00:07:24,798
(That's going too far.)

215
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:26,509
- Will he pluck all of his hair?
- All right then.

216
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:28,939
I will base mine on a film I recently watched.

217
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,309
"The Greatest Showman".

218
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:31,939
(I have my inspiration.)

219
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:36,978
(It's a musical film about a circus troupe's fight against prejudice.)

220
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,788
There are some characters in the film.

221
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:42,519
- The bearded man. The giant.
- Right, right.

222
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,788
I will use those characters.

223
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:45,689
So Min, you'll be doing this.

224
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,059
Jae Seok, how?

225
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:49,389
- How will I hang onto that?
- Right now...

226
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,598
(So Min will do an advanced, aerial stunt act.)

227
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,699
- How will I hang onto that?
- You'll be doing this.

228
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,228
That's none of my concern.

229
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:56,868
That's right. It's not his concern.

230
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,439
You can use duct tape, can't you?

231
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,668
As long as Jae Seok doesn't win...

232
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,509
I really hope mine gets picked this time. I really do.

233
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,848
As for Kwang Soo,

234
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:10,278
it's bigger than last time.

235
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:12,348
- How much bigger can it get?
- What's that?

236
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,848
- Sorry?
- I'm afraid of heights.

237
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:14,949
(Stop it, please.)

238
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,119
- I can't go higher than that.
- This is a circus troupe.

239
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:21,528
Every time yours gets picked, I'll be at least 3m tall.

240
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:22,559
(What a coincidence.)

241
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:26,269
Hey, I'm trying to make you famous.

242
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:27,929
- Okay.
- That's the spirit.

243
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:29,798
Ji Hyo, what about yours?

244
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,469
I'm going to use kaonashis, Jae Seok.

245
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,009
How many are there?

246
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,908
Everyone ought to dress up as it.

247
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,408
That's a family of kaonashis.

248
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,038
Everyone is a kaonashi.

249
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:40,349
(This time, everyone is a kaonashi.)

250
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:42,455
Hey, don't you think it'd be too much if everyone was a kaonashi?

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,048
- That's cute.
- And as for Jong Kook,

252
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,788
he will be wearing a sleeveless top.

253
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:51,418
(Jong Kook will get special treatment.)

254
00:08:51,418 --> 00:08:53,489
- That's adorable.
- He will wear a tank top?

255
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,188
- Hey, that's not the same.
- I like that idea.

256
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:57,428
- That's a good idea. Good job.
- That's great.

257
00:08:57,428 --> 00:08:58,729
You're doing well, Ji Hyo!

258
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,779
- It only sounds the same.
- That's a good idea.

259
00:09:01,328 --> 00:09:03,969
Everyone will be dressed up as a kaonashi,

260
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,099
- but Jong Kook will be...
- He will have manlike fortitude.

261
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:08,438
- He has broad shoulders.
- The tank top will look tough.

262
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:10,209
I can wear the tank top and act tough?

263
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,678
(Look forward to your part, Jong Kook.)

264
00:09:13,349 --> 00:09:15,479
- Isn't that Seok Jin?
- Ji Hyo, I like that.

265
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,879
Right. I forgot about Seok Jin.

266
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,148
(She realizes she forgot Seok Jin after finishing her drawing.)

267
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:22,619
Hey, are you serious?

268
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,459
My gosh. What do I do?

269
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:25,788
- That happens.
- Hey, Seok Jin.

270
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:27,729
- I have a problem.
- Make him the lotus flower.

271
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:29,599
- The lotus flower?
- Don't forget me.

272
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:32,698
- Everyone, did you all finish?
- Yes.

273
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:35,428
- Let's take turns presenting.
- Okay.

274
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:39,369
It's my favorite anime series, "Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog".

275
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,269
("Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog" family)

276
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:42,938
So Min, your drawing is very good.

277
00:09:43,178 --> 00:09:44,479
As you can see,

278
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:46,648
Haha is Demetan,

279
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:48,009
- the main character.
- I am in the middle!

280
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:49,349
Thank you.

281
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:51,379
He is Demetan, and Ji Hyo is Ranatan.

282
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,519
- Ranatan.
- Yes, Ranatan.

283
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,188
- Why do you keep...
- It's cute.

284
00:09:55,188 --> 00:09:57,318
Treating them like they are lovers?

285
00:09:57,558 --> 00:09:59,729
There is nothing between them.

286
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:01,688
I gave the matter much thought,

287
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,099
but they resembled the characters the most.

288
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,359
Now,

289
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,928
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo...

290
00:10:07,928 --> 00:10:10,538
are Demetan's dad and mom.

291
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,739
- What?
- I must ask,

292
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:14,538
- why is Kwang Soo Demetan's mom?
- Is there a problem?

293
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,969
- Who is the mom?
- The character has my eyes.

294
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:18,609
- Kwang Soo is. Her silhouette...
- Kwang Soo is the female frog.

295
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:20,308
- I guess they have similar looks.
- In the anime series, you'll see...

296
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,448
- that they both have a sleek image.
- They have similar looks.

297
00:10:22,448 --> 00:10:23,948
Isn't Demetan's mom sick?

298
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:26,818
(Isn't Demetan's mom sick?)

299
00:10:26,818 --> 00:10:28,119
You are right. She is sick.

300
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,318
You should dress up as a woman.

301
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:32,989
Jong Kook is Gyata.

302
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,788
- It suits him.
- He has a big build like Gyata.

303
00:10:35,788 --> 00:10:38,759
- Se Chan is Zari.
- Zari, the crayfish.

304
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:41,528
I forgot about Seok Jin at first.

305
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,269
I forgot about Seok Jin at first.

306
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,698
- That's why...
- I can't believe you did that.

307
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:47,639
- I drew...
- There aren't a lot of members.

308
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,308
Grandpa Loach.

309
00:10:50,438 --> 00:10:52,639
- There is Grandpa Loach.
- He is in the anime series.

310
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,648
- He is very kind.
- Really?

311
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:57,019
- He is wise.
- He helps the others.

312
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:58,148
He is in the anime series.

313
00:10:58,148 --> 00:11:00,589
Seok Jin is Grandpa Loach.

314
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:02,688
Everyone will have balloons on their bellies.

315
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:03,759
- On our bellies?
- Yes.

316
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,918
- Will they pop?
- Yes, they will get bigger.

317
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,589
In the corner, I will say,

318
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,089
"Running Man is..."

319
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:10,959
Haha will say, "for 12 years..."

320
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,328
- Ji Hyo will say, - Gosh, you are so nice to me.

321
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:13,969
"and older".

322
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:15,528
Then Jong Kook and Se Chan...

323
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:17,239
will pop the balloons on the members' bellies.

324
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:19,239
- Do we punch their bellies?
- Yes.

325
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:21,209
(Punching?)

326
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,609
You should remember that this show is for 12 years and older.

327
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,749
- Don't you think it's too violent?
- It's too violent.

328
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:29,030
This show shouldn't have such a violent TV rating notice.

329
00:11:29,308 --> 00:11:31,778
Ji Hyo and Seok Jin will be exempt.

330
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,624
Only Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Haha will get their balloons popped...

331
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:34,948
by the two villains.

332
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,219
(Only Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Haha are in this predicament.)

333
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:38,558
- The two villains.
- We became villains.

334
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:39,828
May I pop their bellies instead?

335
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:41,658
Of course.

336
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:43,599
However, you are not allowed to express pain.

337
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,058
(Don't show your pain even if you get punched.)

338
00:11:46,058 --> 00:11:48,298
- We are not allowed to show pain.
- No.

339
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,038
- You need to stay cheerful.
- That's right.

340
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,538
Then you must say, "Ribbit, ribbit."

341
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:53,568
- After the balloons pop?
- Yes. After the balloons pop.

342
00:11:53,568 --> 00:11:55,509
"Running Man is for 12 years and older."

343
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:57,509
Punch, punch, punch. "Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit."

344
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,678
(She gives them a summary.)

345
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:03,719
(I like the scenario.)

346
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,349
I want to see...

347
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,965
- if I will throw a good punch.
- For goodness' sake.

348
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,365
- It's like a baby's doodle.
- An elementary schooler's doodle.

349
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,658
As you can see, the theme is "The Greatest Showman".

350
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,489
- I couldn't tell.
- I couldn't tell.

351
00:12:13,489 --> 00:12:14,989
That's not "The Greatest Showman".

352
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:16,904
Anyone would know it depicts "The Greatest Showman".

353
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:19,058
If you have seen the movie, you will go,

354
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,129
"Right."

355
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:22,369
My drawing will touch you...

356
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,739
the same way the movie did.

357
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:28,538
- He really can't draw.
- Seriously.

358
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,315
That looks nothing like "The Greatest Showman".

359
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:33,048
Hugh Jackman's character, the greatest showman,

360
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:35,379
- will be played by me.
- The main character.

361
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:37,048
As you can see,

362
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,278
there is a werewolf.

363
00:12:40,148 --> 00:12:41,849
- Is that a werewolf?
- Yes.

364
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,188
Isn't it a Yorkshire Terrier?

365
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,359
- It's it a fluffy dog?
- Anyone...

366
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,389
- who has seen the movie...
- From that drawing?

367
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,859
Would know it's a werewolf.

368
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:52,129
It's a sapsali.

369
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:53,869
- No, it's not. It's a werewolf.
- How is that a werewolf?

370
00:12:53,869 --> 00:12:55,928
- Who will play it?
- Se Chan.

371
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:57,139
- Me?
- Se Chan will play it.

372
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,668
I think I will look terrible.

373
00:12:58,668 --> 00:13:00,709
A werewolf would be a good choice.

374
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,239
- Also, Kwang Soo will be...
- The Joker.

375
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:04,778
Taller than the last time...

376
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:06,548
so that he'll go out of the screen.

377
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:07,879
(Kwang Soo, the giraffe)

378
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,148
- He will go out of the screen.
- How high should my heels be?

379
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,818
- A very tall man.
- A very tall man?

380
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:14,318
Until when do I have to play a very tall man?

381
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,688
You can be a joker.

382
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,719
Another choice would be a building.

383
00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:19,729
Let's say this show is taking place in the 63 Building.

384
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:22,229
- That's a good idea.
- It's monumental.

385
00:13:22,229 --> 00:13:25,129
It can be the 63 Building or Lotte World Tower.

386
00:13:25,359 --> 00:13:27,229
Why would 63 Building appear in "The Greatest Showman"?

387
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:28,745
Kwang Soo always plays the same type of characters.

388
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,469
As you can see, So Min is hanging...

389
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:32,139
upside down.

390
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:34,438
- Why do I always hang from things?
- Blood will rush to her face.

391
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,109
Actually, she has...

392
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,739
the most important part in my scenario.

393
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:41,249
In "The Greatest Showman", the character is beautiful.

394
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:43,095
Is there really a character who hangs upside down?

395
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,849
She has a love interest, too.

396
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:46,148
(It's a romantic role with a love interest.)

397
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:47,849
So Min isn't playing that character.

398
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,359
I will dress her up as another animal.

399
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,619
(Her dream is shattered.)

400
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:54,428
She will be a bat or something.

401
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:56,599
Is there no bat in "The Greatest Showman"?

402
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,729
No.

403
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:00,099
So Min will be a bat...

404
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,298
- or something.
- Something that hangs.

405
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:03,639
Now, Ji Hyo is...

406
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,168
someone I like very much.

407
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:06,568
I made her a star by assigning her the right character.

408
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,068
Ji Hyo rose to stardom.

409
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,578
Kaonashi and Toshio.

410
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:10,938
(The super rookies, Toshio and Kaonashi)

411
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:12,808
They will appear in the TV rating notice once more.

412
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,178
(It's all thanks to their popularity.)

413
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:16,078
Is that dot supposed to be me?

414
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:18,249
(Is that dot supposed to be me?)

415
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,548
Yes.

416
00:14:19,548 --> 00:14:20,688
Is that me?

417
00:14:20,849 --> 00:14:22,818
- Okay.
- The two of them...

418
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,288
- We are a set.
- A set.

419
00:14:24,318 --> 00:14:25,959
Since they are my favorite characters,

420
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,989
they will make an appearance.

421
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:30,158
We will need makeup.

422
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:31,359
I know.

423
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:33,928
My scenario is very impactful...

424
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:35,698
- and simple.
- Let's see it.

425
00:14:35,698 --> 00:14:38,099
The title is, "With Se Chan at the Fish Market".

426
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,568
It sounds like a hassle.

427
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,739
(With Se Chan at the Fish Market)

428
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:46,249
I dressed up as a fish for the last TV rating notice.

429
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:48,278
- I was so unsatisfied with it...
- That's right.

430
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,578
That I decided to make everyone dress up as fish.

431
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:52,989
Upon consideration, I realized that each member...

432
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:56,048
- resembled a specific fish.
- Yes, there is.

433
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,788
Since Haha has...

434
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:00,688
an image of a delinquent, he will be flying fish.

435
00:15:00,688 --> 00:15:02,688
- Flying fish. I like it.
- Flying fish.

436
00:15:02,898 --> 00:15:05,928
As for So Min, I couldn't decide easily.

437
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:08,269
Because you told me that the catfish costume suited me,

438
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:10,839
you will be a catfish.

439
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,398
- Catfish.
- So Min...

440
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,438
will wear the same costume.

441
00:15:14,438 --> 00:15:15,469
- So Min will be a catfish.
- Catfish.

442
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:16,839
She will have whiskers.

443
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,578
(I must avoid it.)

444
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:21,109
- Jae Seok...
- Which fish will I be?

445
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,219
Likes to chitchat and talk.

446
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,048
- Dried pollack.
- Dried pollack?

447
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:29,658
- Dried pollack.
- He should be dried.

448
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,188
- He should be dried.
- He should be dried.

449
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,459
It's impossible to dress up as a dried fish!

450
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,688
- It's possible...
- He should be dried.

451
00:15:35,688 --> 00:15:36,999
To dress up as a dried fish.

452
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:39,599
He is like dried seafood.

453
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:42,599
Dried seafood? For goodness' sake.

454
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,698
Seok Jin is...

455
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,739
This is a bit heartbreaking.

456
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:51,639
When I am next to him, I can see his white hair.

457
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,648
(Seok Jin is in his 50s.)

458
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,548
That reminded me of white marlin.

459
00:15:56,678 --> 00:15:59,148
- White marlin.
- He has white hair.

460
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:02,619
(He accepts his fate.)

461
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:05,389
Why doesn't he play shellfish?

462
00:16:05,719 --> 00:16:07,428
- Clam?
- Cockle.

463
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:09,828
- Then he will be shellfish...
- Sea cucumber.

464
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:11,599
That is closed.

465
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:12,759
He will be inside.

466
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:15,729
(Se Chan's choice is a closed clam.)

467
00:16:15,729 --> 00:16:17,869
- He will be inside it.
- He will be inside the shell.

468
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:19,739
- Will it be closed?
- It will be closed.

469
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,038
A closed clam.

470
00:16:21,109 --> 00:16:22,538
How about he sticks out his tongue?

471
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:24,054
(He can stick his tongue out of the shell.)

472
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,538
Okay. Hold on.

473
00:16:25,538 --> 00:16:26,749
(He can be a scallop.)

474
00:16:26,808 --> 00:16:28,548
I came up with a scenario.

475
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:31,619
It's Kaonashi's Day.

476
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:33,519
- She was Kaonashi last time.
- Kaonashi.

477
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,918
(Kaonashi's Day)

478
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,389
Jong Kook will be behind me.

479
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,729
- I am still thinking.
- He is wearing a sleeveless top.

480
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,249
I will make him wear a sleeveless top.

481
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,435
I don't know if it will be a cropped sleeveless top...

482
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,898
- or a regular one.
- Go with a cropped top.

483
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:47,229
- Let's go with a cropped top.
- That's right.

484
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:49,028
It's not appropriate for 12-year-olds.

485
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:51,568
Go with a cropped top. He went shirtless in "Mom's Diary".

486
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:53,009
That's right. Let's go with it.

487
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:54,438
People might like it.

488
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:56,739
- Female viewers will love it.
- That's right.

489
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,808
- They will love it.
- Also,

490
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,109
everyone...

491
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:02,918
- will gather slowly.
- We will gather around.

492
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:05,348
- We'll see only half of Kwang Soo.
- Why?

493
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,749
(The members and half of Kwang Soo)

494
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:10,719
- Only a half of him will appear.
- Why?

495
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,428
- He will be at the edge.
- That's right.

496
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:13,929
I thought it was a tree.

497
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:14,989
Only half of him will appear.

498
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:17,358
What did you do to make Ji Hyo love you so much?

499
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,429
Seok Jin is next.

500
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:20,499
(It's Seok Jin's turn to present his scenario.)

501
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,269
Seok Jin's drawing is a sea of blood.

502
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,298
(Seok Jin's drawing is a sea of blood.)

503
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:25,798
- Look at the color.
- Sea of blood.

504
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,669
- What is wrong with you?
- It's a misunderstanding.

505
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:29,979
This is a red carpet.

506
00:17:30,578 --> 00:17:32,808
A red carpet in Hollywood.

507
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:34,878
(The Global Stars on the Red Carpet)

508
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:36,679
Which one is Jong Kook?

509
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:39,019
- My drawing is a bit off, - What is that?

510
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:40,219
But this is Jong Kook...

511
00:17:40,219 --> 00:17:41,388
as Sailor Moon.

512
00:17:41,388 --> 00:17:43,719
(This is Jong Kook as Sailor Moon.)

513
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:46,628
- My drawing is a bit off.
- I see.

514
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:48,429
Sailor Moon is too much.

515
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:52,128
It will be too much of a hassle. Let's prevent him from winning.

516
00:17:52,128 --> 00:17:54,328
(Let's prevent him from winning.)

517
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,098
I won't let that happen.

518
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,368
- I will do my best.
- Let's work together.

519
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,568
I won't let that happen.

520
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,228
"It will be too much of a hassle."

521
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:02,769
It's a scenario no one wants.

522
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,009
Mine is simple.

523
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,318
The makeup will be simple, too.

524
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,048
My scenario involves the sea.

525
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,679
A mudflat...

526
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:11,148
- by the sea.
- Let's stay inside the studio.

527
00:18:11,419 --> 00:18:12,778
We don't want to go to the sea.

528
00:18:12,778 --> 00:18:14,019
(Mudflat Is My World)

529
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:17,959
Dressed in a suit, I will look at the sea.

530
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,508
You should wear those pants. Gosh, what is that?

531
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,298
Gosh, what is that?

532
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:25,628
What is up with your bottom?

533
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:28,068
Those pants are for endoscopy.

534
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,138
I know because I got one.

535
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,274
Then I will turn around and say,

536
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,038
"Running Man is..."

537
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,209
In the distance...

538
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:39,009
will be the seven of you dressed up as spoon worms.

539
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,949
(7 members as spoon worms)

540
00:18:42,949 --> 00:18:44,179
You will shout, "for 12 years and older".

541
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:46,618
- Only you are human.
- Yes.

542
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,749
You should wear those pants.

543
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:50,519
Haha, you will be...

544
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,989
(He clenches his teeth.)

545
00:18:54,028 --> 00:18:55,358
Haha will be inside the sea.

546
00:18:55,989 --> 00:18:57,828
- He will be inside the sea.
- He will be in the water.

547
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:59,929
That's right. He will be a spoon worm in the water.

548
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:00,999
Okay.

549
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,899
Okay. I will do that if you wear those pants.

550
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,169
(He pokes fun at Kwang Soo again.)

551
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:08,368
He will be deep inside the sea.

552
00:19:08,469 --> 00:19:09,578
He will be inside the sea.

553
00:19:10,308 --> 00:19:11,479
He will be inside the sea.

554
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,679
- That's my scenario.
- Okay.

555
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,149
- It's simpler than I expected.
- That's right.

556
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,118
Why does Jong Kook's drawing...

557
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:21,249
have everyone hanging?

558
00:19:21,449 --> 00:19:23,788
Mine is simple. You will hang from the horizontal bar.

559
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:28,088
(Prince Jong Kook of the Horizontal Bar Kingdom)

560
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:31,729
- In teams of two, - He loves it too much.

561
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:34,798
The members will do a chin-up and shout, "Running Man is".

562
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,169
Why would we do that?

563
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,269
Why would we do a chin-up? Isn't that too much?

564
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:38,298
Why?

565
00:19:38,298 --> 00:19:40,709
- It's too hard.
- Doing one chin-up is not hard.

566
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:42,308
Every time you complain,

567
00:19:42,308 --> 00:19:44,078
I'll add 10kg sandbags to your legs.

568
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,009
I mean...

569
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:47,348
We could do something easier.

570
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:49,509
For Jae Seok, I'll add...

571
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,578
a 10kg sandbag to each of his legs.

572
00:19:52,378 --> 00:19:53,848
- And do three chin-ups?
- Yes.

573
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,388
That'd give you more balance.

574
00:19:55,388 --> 00:19:56,858
It's better than only one leg.

575
00:19:56,858 --> 00:19:59,159
- Okay.
- Why are you so quiet?

576
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:00,159
No.

577
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:01,628
Why are you suddenly...

578
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:02,788
- What do you think?
- I like it.

579
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:03,858
Why...

580
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:05,128
More than anything,

581
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,229
I think it suits the concept...

582
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:08,298
- of our show.
- Hey.

583
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,038
- Why are you suddenly quiet?
- No.

584
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:11,568
So Min, why are you so quiet?

585
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:13,409
- Hey.
- I love the idea.

586
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:14,469
Se Chan, say something.

587
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:15,939
Chin-ups are easy.

588
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:17,739
- Yes.
- It's a good idea.

589
00:20:17,739 --> 00:20:18,808
- I agree.
- Gosh.

590
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,578
I'll start preparing right away.

591
00:20:20,578 --> 00:20:22,848
- You flatterer.
- Flatterer...

592
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,149
I'll start preparing.

593
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:26,419
- Gosh.
- Chin-ups are no problem.

594
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:27,449
- You're right.
- Exactly.

595
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,919
I have a really simple idea. Do you want to hear it?

596
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,219
- What is it?
- Seriously,

597
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,489
- it'll be so easy.
- What is it?

598
00:20:34,489 --> 00:20:35,659
It's really simple.

599
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:36,858
- What is it?
- You don't need...

600
00:20:36,858 --> 00:20:38,999
- any costumes or makeup.
- What is it?

601
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:43,538
It's a doppelganger theme.

602
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:47,209
Jae Seok is going to bring Jung Bum Kyun.

603
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,269
(Comedian Jung Bum Kyun)

604
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:50,338
Se Chan is going to bring Yang Se Hyeong.

605
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:53,878
Seok Jin is going to bring Jo Woo Jong.

606
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:56,519
Ji Hyo is going to bring Cheon Seong Moon.

607
00:20:57,578 --> 00:20:58,618
Her brother.

608
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:00,749
Kwang Soo is going to bring Han Gi Beom.

609
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:03,159
(Kwang Soo is going to bring Han Gi Beom.)

610
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:04,288
What?

611
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:05,489
- And...
- Why...

612
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:06,528
You two look alike.

613
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:08,558
I don't even know what he's doing these days.

614
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,999
He teaches basketball.

615
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:12,328
- They look alike.
- It might be tricky for So Min.

616
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:15,399
- So Min's dad...
- My dad?

617
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,899
If he can appear...

618
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,999
- Woo Min looks like her too.
- He's okay too.

619
00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:20,308
But her dad would have more impact.

620
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:22,669
Also, it can be a bit difficult for Jong Kook.

621
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:23,979
Park Se Ri...

622
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,608
(The queen of golf?)

623
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:27,679
They look alike.

624
00:21:28,108 --> 00:21:29,878
- If she can appear...
- They look exactly alike.

625
00:21:29,878 --> 00:21:30,979
I don't think she can come.

626
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,088
- They look alike.
- Just ask her to appear.

627
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,989
You don't have to do anything...

628
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:37,058
except asking them to make an appearance.

629
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,489
- Just help with their makeup.
- That sounds easy.

630
00:21:40,489 --> 00:21:42,788
Who is your doppelganger?

631
00:21:42,788 --> 00:21:44,699
I'm the main character so...

632
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:48,169
Shouldn't your mom appear and say, "Running Man..."

633
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:49,699
His mom should say, "Running Man..."

634
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:50,699
She'd love that.

635
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,068
- My mom should appear?
- Of course.

636
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:54,409
She'll dress like you.

637
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,378
She'd love that.

638
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,278
Yes, I'm afraid she'll love it too much.

639
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,478
- She'd love it too much.
- My dad would say yes right away.

640
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:03,818
It's a good idea, isn't it?

641
00:22:03,818 --> 00:22:05,078
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad.

642
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,318
I love it.

643
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:09,618
Every idea seems tricky this time too.

644
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,588
- You're done with the scripts now.
- Yes.

645
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:14,088
For the first round, you'll form teams of two.

646
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,598
- Let's decide the teams first.
- Okay.

647
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:19,328
Outside, you'll see four different parts of beef.

648
00:22:19,328 --> 00:22:21,499
We've prepared two sets of each part.

649
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,068
(The ones who choose the same parts will be a team.)

650
00:22:23,068 --> 00:22:24,739
You'll choose a part one by one.

651
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,909
The ones who choose the same part will be a team.

652
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:29,979
Each part will be out when it's been chosen by two people.

653
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:31,009
(Each part can be chosen by up to 2 people.)

654
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:33,649
Let's decide in which order you'll choose a part.

655
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,679
(Round 1 depends on whom you team up with.)

656
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:37,249
(The order has been decided by drawing lots.)

657
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:38,679
- Should we start?
- Let's go.

658
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:40,818
What will we be doing today?

659
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:41,848
(Haha, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Se Chan, So Min, Jong Kook, Jae Seok)

660
00:22:41,848 --> 00:22:44,118
- The smell is driving me crazy.
- I smell beef.

661
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:45,719
I guess we'll be eating beef.

662
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,429
- Please start.
- Okay.

663
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:50,499
- See you.
- Haha.

664
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:52,759
- See you.
- Make the right choice.

665
00:22:52,868 --> 00:22:53,929
Here?

666
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:56,128
(Everything looks tasty.)

667
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,439
It all looks tasty.

668
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:58,868
Look at that tenderloin.

669
00:22:58,868 --> 00:22:59,909
(Every part looks delicious.)

670
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:00,969
Rib eye.

671
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:04,909
It looks high-quality.

672
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:07,249
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

673
00:23:07,249 --> 00:23:09,848
(I can't make a choice.)

674
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:12,719
Look at that marbling.

675
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:13,719
(Mouth-watering)

676
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,558
I choose chuck flap.

677
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:21,858
(Haha chooses chuck flap.)

678
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,929
- I'll be right back.
- Seok Jin.

679
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:27,098
- See you.
- Bye.

680
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:28,828
(Let me see.)

681
00:23:28,828 --> 00:23:30,469
I choose rib eye.

682
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:31,549
(Seok Jin chooses rib eye.)

683
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:33,138
I'm supposed to choose one?

684
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,108
Chuck flap, ribs, rib eye, and tenderloin?

685
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,409
Are we going to eat them?

686
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,778
What did you choose?

687
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:38,778
(Kwang Soo could be Haha or Seok Jin's partner.)

688
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,378
- What did you choose?
- What did you choose? Rib eye?

689
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:41,449
- Tenderloin?
- Tenderloin.

690
00:23:41,449 --> 00:23:42,479
Tenderloin.

691
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,848
Tenderloin sounds great.

692
00:23:43,848 --> 00:23:44,848
(They've all chosen different parts.)

693
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:45,848
I'm relieved that...

694
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:47,649
we'll all be on different teams.

695
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:51,159
(They'll be on different teams.)

696
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,659
I'm relieved too. It would have been terrible.

697
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,028
Let's play dirty.

698
00:23:55,028 --> 00:23:56,028
(Let's play dirty.)

699
00:23:56,028 --> 00:23:57,058
I'm ready.

700
00:23:57,058 --> 00:23:59,229
Please support my doppelganger idea. Isn't it great?

701
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,598
- I liked it.
- Right?

702
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,999
- It's not bad.
- It's good, right? It's so simple.

703
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,269
Has anyone chosen chuck flap?

704
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,509
(Has anyone chosen chuck flap?)

705
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,608
(I chose chuck flap.)

706
00:24:07,608 --> 00:24:09,048
You chose it? What about tenderloin?

707
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:11,009
- I chose it.
- Oh, there are four options.

708
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:12,009
(Haha chose chuck flap, and Kwang Soo, tenderloin.)

709
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,754
- What did you choose?
- What did you choose?

710
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:14,808
What did you choose?

711
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,578
He chose tenderloin.

712
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:19,548
(Se Chan chose tenderloin.)

713
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:20,588
Tenderloin? Okay.

714
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:21,919
Okay.

715
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,689
- Kwang Soo.
- Let's do this.

716
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:24,759
They'll play dirty.

717
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,358
I'm so relieved.

718
00:24:26,358 --> 00:24:27,864
This is the first time we've been partners.

719
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:28,989
Is that right?

720
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,499
This is the first time.

721
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,128
Today,

722
00:24:32,128 --> 00:24:35,828
- I'll definitely play dirty.
- Okay.

723
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:37,868
I'll do everything...

724
00:24:37,868 --> 00:24:39,068
- I've stayed away from.
- Me too.

725
00:24:39,068 --> 00:24:40,939
I'll do everything I want for a change.

726
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,709
There are many things I've been staying away from...

727
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:43,939
for the show's sake.

728
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,638
I'll imagine that I'm on an internet show.

729
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:47,179
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Okay.

730
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,108
I just want to avoid Kwang Soo.

731
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:50,348
(It's exhausting.)

732
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:51,848
- It's exhausting.
- So Min is coming.

733
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,388
I can see it.

734
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:54,388
(She's even worse than Kwang Soo.)

735
00:24:54,388 --> 00:24:55,618
- What is it?
- Chuck flap?

736
00:24:55,818 --> 00:24:57,818
(Did you choose chuck flap too?)

737
00:24:57,818 --> 00:24:59,788
No, it's not okay.

738
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:02,788
- She chose ribs.
- No.

739
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,659
- She chose chuck flap.
- I'm partners with Haha.

740
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:05,828
Gosh, it'll be exhausting.

741
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:08,598
(So Min and Haha are on the same team.)

742
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:10,999
She's the female version of Kwang Soo.

743
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:11,999
(The female version of Kwang Soo)

744
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:14,009
That team is going to fail.

745
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:16,209
- It'll be a mess.
- We'll beat at least those two.

746
00:25:16,378 --> 00:25:20,108
Haha and I don't get along.

747
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:21,108
(We don't get along.)

748
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:23,078
I've met many different people,

749
00:25:23,078 --> 00:25:24,219
but you're difficult to me.

750
00:25:24,219 --> 00:25:25,249
Gosh.

751
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:27,318
I don't get to choose.

752
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,818
I'll have to take what's left.

753
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,818
Exactly, the leftovers.

754
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:31,818
- That's right.
- It's sometimes good...

755
00:25:31,818 --> 00:25:33,929
to have no choice.

756
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,358
But it's not always good.

757
00:25:37,358 --> 00:25:38,798
Still, you can't have everything...

758
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:40,298
- your way.
- It's frustrating...

759
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,699
to have no choice when that's not what you want.

760
00:25:41,699 --> 00:25:43,038
It makes things easier.

761
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:44,098
(Arguing)

762
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:46,138
- I feel so uncomfortable.
- This is uncomfortable.

763
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,568
(We feel uncomfortable too.)

764
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:48,969
- I mean...
- I'm getting annoyed.

765
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,739
Please put them on the same team.

766
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:55,149
Don't separate them.

767
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:56,979
You know what?

768
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:58,419
As soon as we're on the same team,

769
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,919
we get along very well.

770
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:01,788
They couldn't get along any better.

771
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:03,358
We become invincible.

772
00:26:03,358 --> 00:26:04,358
That's right.

773
00:26:04,989 --> 00:26:05,989
Okay.

774
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:06,989
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

775
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:09,459
- I better make the right choice.
- It's still cold to wear shorts.

776
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:10,959
It isn't.

777
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,128
Cut it out.

778
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:13,499
Here?

779
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,798
(He has to choose between ribs and rib eye.)

780
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:16,999
I choose ribs.

781
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:21,469
(There are ribs and rib eye left.)

782
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:23,138
- There are two left.
- What are they?

783
00:26:23,138 --> 00:26:24,308
Ribs and rib eye.

784
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,179
(What will Ji Hyo and Jae Seok choose?)

785
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,009
- They're here.
- What did you choose?

786
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,989
(Jong Kook chose ribs, and Seok Jin, rib eye.)

787
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:34,689
- Gosh.
- What did you choose?

788
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,259
(What did you choose?)

789
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:37,659
What did you choose?

790
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,159
I chose ribs.

791
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,088
This is what we were talking about.

792
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,999
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin versus Jae Seok and Jong Kook)

793
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,628
(Did you choose ribs?)

794
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:49,868
It'll be exhausting.

795
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:53,108
My goodness.

796
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,009
They kept arguing.

797
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:57,439
Gosh.

798
00:26:57,439 --> 00:27:01,378
(My goodness. Let's do this.)

799
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:02,578
Let's do this.

800
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:04,848
- We'll be the winners.
- Gosh.

801
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:05,878
I can't believe it.

802
00:27:05,878 --> 00:27:06,949
(They become invincible together.)

803
00:27:06,949 --> 00:27:10,259
The ones who chose the same parts will become a team.

804
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,058
- I knew it.
- Please enjoy your meat.

805
00:27:13,058 --> 00:27:14,689
After that, I'll announce the first mission.

806
00:27:14,689 --> 00:27:16,358
Gosh, So Min.

807
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:18,959
- Really?
- Oh, my.

808
00:27:18,959 --> 00:27:20,568
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

809
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:22,229
Here comes charcoal.

810
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:24,469
(They're exhausted after deciding teams.)

811
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:26,239
- That looks delicious.
- Yes.

812
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,439
It looks so tasty.

813
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,108
The meat looks fantastic.

814
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,009
- It looks delicious.
- My mouth is watering.

815
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,149
(The beef makes their mouths water.)

816
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,848
(This is crazy.)

817
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:35,909
It's so tender.

818
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:37,278
It's high-quality.

819
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,288
(Eat up.)

820
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:43,959
- Thank you for the meat.
- Thank you.

821
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:45,419
It tasted so good.

822
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,189
Everyone, did you enjoy your meal?

823
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:48,459
- Yes.
- Really.

824
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,058
Let me announce the rules for the first game.

825
00:27:51,058 --> 00:27:54,568
Each team has to find a celebrity who can appear as a guest.

826
00:27:54,568 --> 00:27:55,568
- What?
- What?

827
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,169
Then you should know many people.

828
00:27:57,169 --> 00:27:58,999
Kwang Soo and I don't know many people.

829
00:27:58,999 --> 00:28:00,068
(They have to find guests.)

830
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:01,169
We don't know many people.

831
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:02,568
You know I don't have many friends.

832
00:28:02,568 --> 00:28:03,709
(What is the mission about?)

833
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,449
Let's come up with a strategy. Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

834
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,449
If your guest is the oldest...

835
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:11,278
or the youngest, you'll win no points.

836
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,419
The 2nd oldest will win 20 points,

837
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,019
and the 3rd oldest, 10 points.

838
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:19,259
It's better to be older.

839
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,159
- It's tricky.
- But the oldest wins no points.

840
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,929
(You should go for the 2nd or 3rd oldest.)

841
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:24,959
If some of them were born in the same year,

842
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,068
we'll look at their birthdays.

843
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:28,969
1987, 1986, 1985,

844
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:31,439
- 1984...
- It should be around there.

845
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,838
We should go for the middle.

846
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:35,138
- It's difficult.
- It's tricky.

847
00:28:35,138 --> 00:28:36,578
It'll be hard to win.

848
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,808
(They have to predict the other teams' strategies.)

849
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,108
You'll also play games with the guests...

850
00:28:42,108 --> 00:28:45,019
and win points according to the result.

851
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,078
(They can win additional points.)

852
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:48,548
- It's hard.
- It's driving me crazy.

853
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:50,118
Should we start calling?

854
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:51,419
Please get in the cars.

855
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,588
- Okay.
- Okay.

856
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:54,259
Please start.

857
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:56,058
(The mission starts.)

858
00:28:56,699 --> 00:28:58,528
Ji Hyo, whom should we call?

859
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,868
- We should go for the middle.
- Yes.

860
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:04,169
Should I play my hidden card?

861
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:05,439
What is it?

862
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,608
Kim Seok Jin of BTS.

863
00:29:09,368 --> 00:29:10,608
(What?)

864
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:12,078
Really?

865
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:13,378
BTS?

866
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,479
I think he is about 22 years old.

867
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,719
- Should I call him?
- Do it.

868
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:19,919
(He brags about his friendship.)

869
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,019
- See?
- There you go.

870
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:23,959
(It's at least ringing.)

871
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:29,999
- Hello.
- Seok Jin.

872
00:29:29,999 --> 00:29:32,128
- Hi.
- Hi.

873
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:33,169
Hi.

874
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:34,169
(Surprised)

875
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:35,798
Hi, Seok Jin. This is Seok Jin.

876
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:37,499
- How are you?
- It's good to hear from you.

877
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:38,638
Hello, Seok Jin.

878
00:29:38,638 --> 00:29:40,269
Blood, sweat, tears

879
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:41,868
This is Ji Hyo.

880
00:29:41,969 --> 00:29:43,878
Hello, Ji Hyo.

881
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:46,348
- Hey.
- Are you shooting Running Man?

882
00:29:46,348 --> 00:29:47,909
- Yes.
- We're shooting Running Man.

883
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:50,249
My voice is on Running Man.

884
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,679
I can't believe it.

885
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,249
It's our honor.

886
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,919
Say hello to the Running Man viewers.

887
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:59,219
Hello, viewers of Running Man.

888
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,259
This is Jin of BTS.

889
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:03,499
As my name is the same as Seok Jin's,

890
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,759
we maintain our friendship.

891
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,328
I'm Kim Seok Jin.

892
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:08,528
(He talks sweetly.)

893
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:11,038
You talk so well. You're good at everything.

894
00:30:11,068 --> 00:30:12,169
Where are you now?

895
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:15,808
I'm at a shoot with the other members.

896
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,209
- Really?
- Are you at a shoot?

897
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:19,409
- Yes.
- Are you in Korea?

898
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,348
I'm in Korea. Call me anytime you want to see me.

899
00:30:22,348 --> 00:30:23,348
Really?

900
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:25,149
(I'm in Korea. Call me anytime you want to see me.)

901
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:26,348
(Call him anytime?)

902
00:30:26,348 --> 00:30:27,649
Call me anytime.

903
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:29,588
How about today?

904
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,719
- Today?
- Do you have time?

905
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:34,229
(Do you mean today?)

906
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:35,729
It's so sudden.

907
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:38,929
You told him to contact you anytime.

908
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,598
- Do you mean today?
- Today.

909
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:43,298
- It won't take long.
- Which area are you in?

910
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:45,169
I'm in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province.

911
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,638
- Your shoot is in Gwangju.
- Really?

912
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:48,669
Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province?

913
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:50,578
(Whom will Seok Jin and Ji Hyo invite?)

914
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:54,378
Is there anyone to call? It has to be predictable.

915
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:55,878
So Min.

916
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:58,179
Someone young will put us at a disadvantage.

917
00:30:58,278 --> 00:30:59,788
- It'd be uncertain.
- Someone young is dangerous.

918
00:30:59,788 --> 00:31:01,618
Inviting someone young will be dangerous.

919
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,959
Let's do this.

920
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:05,288
You should call Kwang Soo right now.

921
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:07,259
Put down a bait.

922
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,199
Tell him that we should place 2nd and 3rd.

923
00:31:10,229 --> 00:31:11,358
- Then...
- Will he believe me?

924
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:13,328
Propose it, and make him confused.

925
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:14,328
(Will he believe us?)

926
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:15,929
You and I are on the same team.

927
00:31:17,739 --> 00:31:18,969
Tell him sincerely.

928
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,439
- Hello?
- Kwang Soo.

929
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:22,709
Yes?

930
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,638
I spoke with Haha.

931
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:28,548
- What if we try to place...
- 2nd and 3rd place.

932
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:29,878
2nd and 3rd together?

933
00:31:29,878 --> 00:31:31,878
- We could do that.
- Right.

934
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,649
How?

935
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,219
Tell us the year the person you invite was born.

936
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:38,058
Tell us the year he was born.

937
00:31:38,058 --> 00:31:40,959
The eldest person will be born in 1965.

938
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,858
- 1965?
- Or early 1947.

939
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,098
We aren't sure yet.

940
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,368
- Early 1947?
- You know someone of that age?

941
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:49,899
It's because Jae Seok's team said...

942
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,169
- that they'll meet Song Hae.
- What?

943
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,638
Really? That's helpful information.

944
00:31:54,709 --> 00:31:57,538
Yes, you should invite the eldest person possible...

945
00:31:57,538 --> 00:31:59,338
or the youngest one possible.

946
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,479
- Okay, I see.
- Okay, Haha.

947
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:03,078
- Bye.
- Bye.

948
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:04,649
They're both...

949
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:06,719
such cheaters.

950
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:09,048
They're terrible punks.

951
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,159
(He's furious.)

952
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:13,128
- We must place 2nd...
- For 20 points.

953
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:14,429
To earn 20 points.

954
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,699
How about someone born in 1982?

955
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,259
- 83.
- 1982.

956
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:19,358
(Shall we look for someone born in 1982?)

957
00:32:19,358 --> 00:32:20,628
When was Sae Ho born?

958
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:22,269
Is he going somewhere today?

959
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:23,769
Was he born in 1982?

960
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,899
I met Sae Ho yesterday.

961
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:27,969
He doesn't have much work these days.

962
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:30,009
- Hello, Haha.
- Sae Ho.

963
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:32,479
- Hey, what's up?
- Hello.

964
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,378
- Yes, Haha.
- How old are you?

965
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:35,449
What year were you born?

966
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:36,979
I was born in 1982.

967
00:32:36,979 --> 00:32:38,149
- 1982?
- 1982?

968
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,088
Yes, many people are calling me today.

969
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:42,618
Why? Who?

970
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:45,959
I'm not sure. I don't know what's going on.

971
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,989
I was getting ready today.

972
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,259
May we come see you?

973
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:52,399
You may come, but I heard that someone else is coming.

974
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:54,669
I don't think I can tell you what's going on.

975
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:56,969
Does it happen to be Jae Seok?

976
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,439
I have to respect their place.

977
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,538
It's Jae Seok, isn't it?

978
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:01,269
I'm not sure.

979
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:03,278
It's Yu Jae Seok, right?

980
00:33:03,578 --> 00:33:06,649
I can't say much, but it's an interesting situation.

981
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:07,979
All right.

982
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,249
I'll be here alone.

983
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,878
- Okay.
- Bye.

984
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:13,348
Isn't it amazing?

985
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,219
This is amazing.

986
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:17,358
- We got helpful information.
- Right.

987
00:33:17,358 --> 00:33:19,639
(Haha and So Min found out that Jae Seok invited Sae Ho.)

988
00:33:19,828 --> 00:33:21,159
It's hard to predict.

989
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,459
This mission is hard to predict.

990
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:26,328
- What about Sae Ho?
- Sae Ho.

991
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,568
- Cho Sae Ho.
- Sae Ho would be great.

992
00:33:28,769 --> 00:33:30,068
- Wait.
- We should...

993
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:31,798
Sae Ho needs work.

994
00:33:31,798 --> 00:33:33,568
- Right.
- He isn't working.

995
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,068
Jae Seok.

996
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:36,979
You keep inviting members from that show.

997
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,209
- It's a misunderstanding.
- Did I?

998
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,348
- Did I misunderstand?
- Of course.

999
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:42,679
I wouldn't.

1000
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:44,348
You keep inviting them.

1001
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:45,519
(He tries to call Sae Ho.)

1002
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,088
Ho Sae, Ho Sae, Ho Sae, Carlos.

1003
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:50,358
This is Ho Sae, Ho Sae, Ho Sae, Carlos.

1004
00:33:50,358 --> 00:33:51,358
Where are you?

1005
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:53,459
I'm at Joo Ho's cafe.

1006
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,858
- Why did you go there?
- That means you aren't working.

1007
00:33:55,858 --> 00:33:57,999
I have to go to Busan soon.

1008
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:58,999
When?

1009
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:01,328
I leave on a train at 6pm tonight.

1010
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:03,169
- That's great.
- That's good.

1011
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,169
- What?
- I wanted to find you some work.

1012
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:09,238
You lost work recently.

1013
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:11,339
I wanted to find you something.

1014
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:15,508
- Yes. That's right.
- Are you in Apgujeong?

1015
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:17,379
We'll see you there.

1016
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:18,749
(They invite themselves.)

1017
00:34:18,749 --> 00:34:19,919
Is something going on?

1018
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,919
- See you soon.
- Let's talk in person.

1019
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,888
Sae Ho, I live in the area.

1020
00:34:25,058 --> 00:34:26,558
- Is this Jong Kook?
- Yes.

1021
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,258
- What is it?
- Ask the owner...

1022
00:34:28,459 --> 00:34:31,058
to prepare what I always have.

1023
00:34:31,158 --> 00:34:32,758
- Sae Ho.
- Yes?

1024
00:34:32,758 --> 00:34:34,968
You know my favorite drink? Order it for me.

1025
00:34:35,328 --> 00:34:37,769
- You've never been here.
- Hey.

1026
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:40,769
You still know my favorite drink.

1027
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:41,968
- Sae Ho.
- I got it.

1028
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,408
Order what I always get.

1029
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:45,279
- Okay.
- Sae Ho.

1030
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:48,908
- Yes, Jae Seok?
- Pay me back today.

1031
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:50,749
I never borrowed money from you.

1032
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:52,279
What are you talking about?

1033
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:53,519
I'm sorry, but I never did.

1034
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,988
You borrowed money two weeks ago.

1035
00:34:54,988 --> 00:34:56,658
- What?
- How much was it?

1036
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:58,519
Can I say it on TV?

1037
00:34:58,689 --> 00:34:59,959
Yes, you can.

1038
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:01,288
You borrowed 1,500 dollars.

1039
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,729
- This is true.
- What?

1040
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:04,058
- This is true.
- It's a scary world.

1041
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,368
Gosh, this must be true.

1042
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,868
For now...

1043
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,968
- I got it.
- You must pay people back.

1044
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:12,198
Let's talk in person.

1045
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:14,908
- Okay, see you.
- See you.

1046
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:19,339
I think the best age would be of someone...

1047
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:22,379
- born between 1985 and 1987.
- Right?

1048
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:25,379
Shall we call Park Jung Min? He was born in 1987.

1049
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:26,618
Really?

1050
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,519
- Shall I call him?
- Yes.

1051
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:29,959
- Is he an actor?
- He was born in 1987.

1052
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,158
- That's fine. He's 32.
- Right.

1053
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:36,129
Hello.

1054
00:35:36,129 --> 00:35:37,859
- Hey, where are you?
- Why?

1055
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,198
I just came back home right now.

1056
00:35:40,368 --> 00:35:41,629
Were you at a shoot?

1057
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:43,968
Yes. Did you call to ask me to give you something?

1058
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:46,138
- No.
- Is it for something?

1059
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:47,238
(He's flustered.)

1060
00:35:47,238 --> 00:35:48,609
- In the past, - What does he mean?

1061
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:50,538
We shot Running Man at Jung Min's house.

1062
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:52,078
- Did you ask for something?
- We stole his bidet.

1063
00:35:52,078 --> 00:35:53,078
- Really?
- Yes.

1064
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,779
He's never been on the show, but his bidet has.

1065
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,819
That's nice.

1066
00:35:57,779 --> 00:35:59,988
(Hideout Race in March of last year)

1067
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:02,388
(Jung Min decides to donate his bidet.)

1068
00:36:02,589 --> 00:36:05,488
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo enter Jung Min's house without him.)

1069
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:09,258
(Jung Min's bidet appears on the show.)

1070
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,758
Can you come to Gangnam?

1071
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:14,729
Where in Gangnam?

1072
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:15,868
Nonhyeon.

1073
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,799
- Here's why.
- Yes.

1074
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:20,339
You were selected as the person...

1075
00:36:20,368 --> 00:36:22,508
we'd like to invite the most.

1076
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:24,538
Stop lying.

1077
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,848
It's true. You got 20 votes.

1078
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,549
From whom?

1079
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:30,379
All the members including the staff.

1080
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:32,218
What do I have to do there?

1081
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:34,519
- You'll receive a trophy.
- Right.

1082
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,689
- Okay.
- We give you a prize.

1083
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:38,718
(Will Jung Min pretend to fall for Kwang Soo's trick?)

1084
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,859
Anything is possible. Send me the address.

1085
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:43,258
(He's very kind.)

1086
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,058
Okay, I'll send it to you now.

1087
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:47,029
- Okay, Kwang Soo.
- See you soon.

1088
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:48,169
See you.

1089
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,968
(They successfully invite Jung Min.)

1090
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:52,769
- Who was born in 1983?
- 1983?

1091
00:36:52,769 --> 00:36:54,769
- Born in 1983.
- There aren't many.

1092
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:57,578
We have to find out. We got helpful information.

1093
00:36:57,578 --> 00:36:59,749
- You're right.
- It must be younger than Sae Ho.

1094
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:00,879
That's right.

1095
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:02,749
- It's better that we place second.
- Right.

1096
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:05,979
Among celebrities born in 1982,

1097
00:37:05,979 --> 00:37:08,848
I'll look up for their birthdays.

1098
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:12,819
Kang Hye Jung, Lee Si Young, Wheesung, Sae Ho.

1099
00:37:13,558 --> 00:37:14,629
Lee Young Eun? Wait.

1100
00:37:14,988 --> 00:37:17,058
- Lee Young Eun.
- Her birthday is August 9th.

1101
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,399
Sae Ho was born on August 9th.

1102
00:37:19,459 --> 00:37:20,569
They have the same birthday.

1103
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:21,929
(They find actress Lee Young Eun.)

1104
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:23,799
It'd be fun to compare by hour.

1105
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,038
It's unbelievable.

1106
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:27,868
Don't we want to make Jae Seok and Jong Kook upset?

1107
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:31,279
You and I agree on matters like this.

1108
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,379
What time was Sae Ho born?

1109
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,979
He was born in the morning.

1110
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,649
- Is that all we know?
- Let's ask her...

1111
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:39,448
to say that she was born at 11:50pm.

1112
00:37:39,448 --> 00:37:42,019
Ask her to say that she was born at 11:58pm

1113
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,988
- Don't we need...
- Don't give them a chance.

1114
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:45,459
Proof?

1115
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:47,928
No, ask her mother to say it.

1116
00:37:48,428 --> 00:37:49,488
It's fine.

1117
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:52,698
She'll say that she was born at 11:58pm.

1118
00:37:52,698 --> 00:37:54,999
Hold on. Haha is so scary.

1119
00:37:54,999 --> 00:37:57,868
- Why?
- Your scale is so big.

1120
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,269
Is there a scale to fraud?

1121
00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:03,209
- The scale of your fraud is big.
- "Scale"?

1122
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:05,178
Winning is important.

1123
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:06,618
(That's why people talk about Haha.)

1124
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:08,908
- Finally.
- I learned something important.

1125
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:10,178
It's necessary.

1126
00:38:10,178 --> 00:38:11,498
(It's a fraud on a higher level.)

1127
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:15,118
She replied to me.

1128
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,149
- She did.
- Here it is.

1129
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:17,689
(Lee Young Eun is an old friend of Haha.)

1130
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:18,959
Sound positive.

1131
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:20,459
We must invite her.

1132
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,259
(She's also So Min's colleague from college.)

1133
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:29,399
- Hello.
- Hello.

1134
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:32,138
- I'm So Min from Running Man.
- We're from Running Man.

1135
00:38:32,138 --> 00:38:33,169
I'm Haha.

1136
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:36,069
You're selected as the most-wanted celebrity...

1137
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:38,879
- on Running Man.
- Congratulations.

1138
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:41,348
- Was I?
- Hello, Young Eun.

1139
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:43,178
This is Haha. Do you remember me?

1140
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:45,479
- Hello, Haha.
- Hello.

1141
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,718
Young Eun, this is So Min from class of 2005.

1142
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:50,859
- Hello. She's my senior.
- Hello.

1143
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,419
- That's right.
- Hello.

1144
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:54,058
- It's a connection by fate.
- Right.

1145
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:56,598
This is out of the blue. Why was I selected?

1146
00:38:56,598 --> 00:38:58,399
- Were you born on August 9th?
- Why me?

1147
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:00,428
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

1148
00:39:00,428 --> 00:39:02,799
- Unbelievable.
- Do you have the same birthday?

1149
00:39:02,868 --> 00:39:04,698
No, mine is August 20th.

1150
00:39:04,868 --> 00:39:06,508
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1151
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:07,968
Mine is August 7th.

1152
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:09,779
- Really?
- This is amazing.

1153
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:12,678
- Is it about people born in August?
- That's right.

1154
00:39:12,738 --> 00:39:15,979
(Is it about people born in August? That's right.)

1155
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,149
Pardon me for asking, but what time were you born?

1156
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:23,888
I was born around 12:20am.

1157
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,488
It was around then.

1158
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:28,158
On which day?

1159
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:31,428
Wait, I did some research.

1160
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:33,428
- You were born...
- Yes?

1161
00:39:33,499 --> 00:39:36,029
- On August 9...
- Okay.

1162
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:40,538
At 11:59pm.

1163
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,839
- I was?
- Yes, yes.

1164
00:39:44,078 --> 00:39:45,908
I heard it. I really did.

1165
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:47,508
From whom?

1166
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,718
From your mom.

1167
00:39:50,279 --> 00:39:51,379
Is that so?

1168
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,919
You were born around 11:50pm. I'm serious. You really were.

1169
00:39:55,488 --> 00:39:57,819
Isn't that true? Why don't you think about it again?

1170
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,888
- Was I?
- "Was I?"

1171
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:02,899
No, no. I was told I was born between 11pm to 1am.

1172
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:04,459
Come again?

1173
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,169
You know they used to count hours by two back then.

1174
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:08,899
(The 1st pair goes from 11pm to 1am the next day.)

1175
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:11,098
- You can forget about that now.
- Okay.

1176
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:15,538
- You were born at 11:59pm.
- You were born at 11:59pm.

1177
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,408
- Congratulations.
- Yes!

1178
00:40:18,379 --> 00:40:21,209
You were born around 11:50pm.

1179
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,919
- Right.
- Sure. I got it.

1180
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,319
Congratulations.

1181
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:25,419
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

1182
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:27,118
- Okay.
- My gosh, this is crazy.

1183
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:30,089
(Haha invites Young Eun to complete his grand scheme.)

1184
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:32,189
Haha, I have so much respect for you.

1185
00:40:32,189 --> 00:40:34,558
- How do you come up with this?
- My gosh.

1186
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:36,058
Is this your innate quality?

1187
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:38,698
- Since when were you smart?
- Well, this is...

1188
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:40,698
Well, it's just that...

1189
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:42,328
I never had the chance to show this.

1190
00:40:43,038 --> 00:40:45,538
- Is that why you were...
- If I had shown my intelligence,

1191
00:40:45,738 --> 00:40:48,169
- You couldn't survive?
- I couldn't have survived.

1192
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,339
(My gosh, it's so hard to be me.)

1193
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:52,738
That's why you were a bit...

1194
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:54,368
I mean, you taught yourself everything.

1195
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,508
I'm a bit what?

1196
00:40:56,008 --> 00:40:57,319
What were you going to say?

1197
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:58,779
- That I was a jerk?
- No, no.

1198
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,249
Do I sound so conceited?

1199
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:02,718
You taught yourself that, right?

1200
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:05,118
- You trained yourself for it.
- You were on it too.

1201
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:07,459
- No, I just helped you a bit.
- Weren't you?

1202
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:09,288
Hey, stop lying!

1203
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:11,959
All the momentum came from you.

1204
00:41:12,328 --> 00:41:13,328
I have a question.

1205
00:41:13,328 --> 00:41:16,368
Time to time, you talk to the camera when you're alone.

1206
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:17,538
Why do you do that?

1207
00:41:18,098 --> 00:41:20,209
- Is it because you're frustrated?
- I don't have anyone to trust.

1208
00:41:20,209 --> 00:41:22,439
Now, my only friend is the camera.

1209
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:27,078
The camera listens to me when I talk and puts up with me.

1210
00:41:27,348 --> 00:41:29,649
The truth airs without being distorted.

1211
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:32,348
It doesn't betray me like people do.

1212
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,549
- It accepts me as I am.
- I see.

1213
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:35,819
(They compete to see who can be more emotional.)

1214
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,218
I know what you mean.

1215
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,359
That's why I film myself a lot at home.

1216
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,928
(I know exactly how you feel.)

1217
00:41:43,529 --> 00:41:45,859
(He's weird. I don't go that far.)

1218
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,828
Dream's baby nickname was Selfie.

1219
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:50,138
"Selfie, Selfie."

1220
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:53,209
I don't have anyone I can trust. It's the truth.

1221
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,408
(His doubt regarding people has grown due to Running Man.)

1222
00:41:55,408 --> 00:41:57,078
All right. You invited your guest.

1223
00:41:57,879 --> 00:42:00,479
Before we reveal the mission you will try with the guest,

1224
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:03,718
predict the outcome of the mission,

1225
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:07,189
and bet on the victory or loss.

1226
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:10,718
(They can bet on the victory or loss in secret.)

1227
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:14,029
If you bet on the correct outcome, you will earn 10 points.

1228
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:15,264
If I make the correct bet, I'll get the points?

1229
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:16,959
Yes. And if you guess the outcome correctly,

1230
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,258
the guest will get...

1231
00:42:18,258 --> 00:42:20,129
- the Korean beef gift set.
- Really?

1232
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,328
- Let's do our best.
- Right.

1233
00:42:22,328 --> 00:42:23,738
(Do it for Young Eun's sake.)

1234
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:27,538
I mean it. Seriously. Let's be civil about this.

1235
00:42:27,939 --> 00:42:29,038
Let's be nice about it.

1236
00:42:29,038 --> 00:42:30,138
(Contemplating)

1237
00:42:30,138 --> 00:42:32,408
- We should both bet on the victory.
- No, Haha.

1238
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:34,578
Let's make sure we don't jeopardize each other.

1239
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,718
If we accomplish the mission, it will be good for everyone.

1240
00:42:36,718 --> 00:42:39,448
- We can both get 10 points.
- We can give her the Korean beef.

1241
00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:42,049
- Exactly. Our intention is good.
- That'd be better.

1242
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:44,058
Victory, then.

1243
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:46,189
Victory, then.

1244
00:42:47,328 --> 00:42:49,698
(What? Loss?)

1245
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:52,629
(She writes down "loss" without missing a beat.)

1246
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,198
Did you really write down "victory"?

1247
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:57,368
Since my handwriting is bad, let me rewrite this.

1248
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,038
- Hey, hey.
- What?

1249
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,908
I can see everything through your camera.

1250
00:43:04,308 --> 00:43:06,178
I didn't write it, Haha. I was going to write it again.

1251
00:43:06,178 --> 00:43:08,448
(She pretends to be unaffected.)

1252
00:43:08,808 --> 00:43:10,249
(Feeling embarrassed)

1253
00:43:10,848 --> 00:43:12,819
(Despite her instincts to cheat, her acts are sloppy.)

1254
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:13,919
I can't believe her.

1255
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:15,019
I'll trust you this time.

1256
00:43:15,948 --> 00:43:17,258
I did it. I really wrote it.

1257
00:43:17,258 --> 00:43:19,689
(I really wrote down, "victory".)

1258
00:43:19,689 --> 00:43:20,904
- You really wrote it.
- I did.

1259
00:43:20,928 --> 00:43:22,029
Then me too.

1260
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:23,058
(I will write the same.)

1261
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,258
(So Min shows that she has written "victory" too.)

1262
00:43:25,258 --> 00:43:27,899
(They both bet on the victory. What will happen to them?)

1263
00:43:28,229 --> 00:43:29,968
Will you bet on our victory or loss?

1264
00:43:30,138 --> 00:43:31,339
I might write "victory"...

1265
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:33,069
or "loss".

1266
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,468
Victory or loss.

1267
00:43:35,468 --> 00:43:37,068
(What's he saying? I'll follow my guts.)

1268
00:43:37,408 --> 00:43:39,209
- We must make sure we win.
- You bet.

1269
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,678
But I can't show you mine just in case.

1270
00:43:42,678 --> 00:43:45,358
- Yes, cover up, and write it down.
- I have to write it in secret?

1271
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:47,819
But if you bet on the loss,

1272
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:49,864
- we don't need to play at all.
- It ruins the purpose.

1273
00:43:49,888 --> 00:43:51,718
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan finish betting too.)

1274
00:43:52,788 --> 00:43:55,359
Let's not lie. Come on. Goodness.

1275
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,698
We can both get 10 points.

1276
00:43:57,799 --> 00:43:59,359
- You're right.
- Aren't I right?

1277
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:00,999
Hey, for this mission,

1278
00:44:01,899 --> 00:44:03,468
we are in the same team.

1279
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:06,308
Did you say, "hey"? Don't forget that we're filming.

1280
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:08,185
- When did I call you that?
- How could you say that?

1281
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:10,678
- How could you call me that?
- When did I say that?

1282
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:11,979
Didn't you hear him say that?

1283
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:13,808
- He said that.
- When did I say that?

1284
00:44:13,948 --> 00:44:15,549
- This is weird.
- I'm not that rude.

1285
00:44:15,549 --> 00:44:16,819
You called me that.

1286
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,578
(Jong Kook and Jae Seok finish betting while quarreling.)

1287
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:20,589
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

1288
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:22,549
(Anyway, what's today's mission?)

1289
00:44:22,549 --> 00:44:24,764
I will announce the mission you will try with your guest.

1290
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,788
The team mission you will try with the guest is...

1291
00:44:27,258 --> 00:44:29,158
- Nice Bowling.
- What?

1292
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:31,399
The three of you will take turns to bowl.

1293
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:33,799
If the final score is over 150, you succeed.

1294
00:44:33,868 --> 00:44:36,238
My gosh, this is a hard one.

1295
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,968
Wait, we'll bowl at a bowling alley?

1296
00:44:37,999 --> 00:44:39,339
Yes, we'll go to a bowling alley.

1297
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,479
- I'm terrible at bowling.
- What?

1298
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,908
This is what I mean. I think you're already setting it up.

1299
00:44:46,908 --> 00:44:48,008
My gosh, I'm serious.

1300
00:44:48,008 --> 00:44:49,919
Had I known, I wouldn't have bet on the victory.

1301
00:44:49,919 --> 00:44:51,379
My gosh, Jae Seok.

1302
00:44:52,618 --> 00:44:55,888
- Stop acting.
- I'm serious. I'm bad at bowling.

1303
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,459
I will do my best though. I will.

1304
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:01,558
(Something is fishy. Jae Seok is never humble.)

1305
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,629
- But 200...
- When I bowled last time,

1306
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:05,229
the score was 70 or something.

1307
00:45:05,299 --> 00:45:07,229
Jae Seok, I'll make you do well.

1308
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:09,738
- I mean it.
- It's not that.

1309
00:45:09,738 --> 00:45:11,368
- I'm bad at it.
- No, I'll help you.

1310
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:13,038
- You can do it.
- That's not the point.

1311
00:45:13,038 --> 00:45:15,238
You can do it. You will improve with my coaching.

1312
00:45:15,308 --> 00:45:17,609
- I'm talking about myself. Why...
- Listen.

1313
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:19,908
I'll give it a try. I'll help you become a great bowler.

1314
00:45:19,979 --> 00:45:21,824
- I can give you a crash course.
- This is crazy.

1315
00:45:21,848 --> 00:45:23,495
- My gosh, Jong Kook.
- I got this, Jae Seok.

1316
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,149
I'll give you a crash course.

1317
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:26,788
I'm sorry,

1318
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:29,189
- What is it? - but your hand keeps coming over.

1319
00:45:29,189 --> 00:45:30,218
Keep it midway.

1320
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:31,788
We're not supposed to split the space in half.

1321
00:45:31,788 --> 00:45:33,388
- I didn't do that.
- Let me tell you what it is.

1322
00:45:33,388 --> 00:45:35,788
- You need to call dibs on it.
- It's not about calling dibs.

1323
00:45:35,788 --> 00:45:37,198
Why don't you push my hand then?

1324
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:39,198
Push it away.

1325
00:45:39,799 --> 00:45:41,899
- No, listen.
- This is my natural angle.

1326
00:45:41,899 --> 00:45:43,069
If it's too close,

1327
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:45,069
- it's not comfortable.
- The centrifugal force...

1328
00:45:45,269 --> 00:45:47,609
I'm comfortable with this angle.

1329
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:51,008
(I shouldn't have bothered.)

1330
00:45:52,109 --> 00:45:54,509
I don't like my partner, but I should still put up with him.

1331
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,279
I can't believe he can't bowl.

1332
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,819
I'm so upset.

1333
00:46:03,118 --> 00:46:04,589
Let's cut. 1, 2, 3.

1334
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:05,658
(He's sick of this.)

1335
00:46:06,758 --> 00:46:09,529
(And they head to the bowling alley for 30 minutes in silence.)

1336
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:12,359
I used to come to this area often when I was young.

1337
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:14,098
- It's cool in here.
- Come inside.

1338
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:15,368
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1339
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,769
- Hello.
- Honey.

1340
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:19,569
(It's been a while since he said, "honey".)

1341
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:20,709
Sae Ho.

1342
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:23,508
- What's going on?
- My gosh.

1343
00:46:23,508 --> 00:46:24,709
(Sae Ho guarantees to be funny.)

1344
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:26,908
- You're already at the cafe.
- What brings you here?

1345
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:28,709
It's been a while.

1346
00:46:28,709 --> 00:46:30,979
(Viewers of Running Man, it's been a while.)

1347
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:32,249
No, it hasn't been a while.

1348
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:33,319
- I must say hello.
- Don't do that.

1349
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:35,189
- I should introduce myself.
- No, we like you to be natural.

1350
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:36,589
- It's been a while.
- We are meeting casually.

1351
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:37,964
- Our show hates that the most.
- Is that so?

1352
00:46:37,988 --> 00:46:39,189
- We hate self-introductions.
- We don't like introductions.

1353
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:40,689
- But still. I must say hi.
- No, no.

1354
00:46:40,788 --> 00:46:42,459
- It's not natural.
- I'm sorry about that.

1355
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:44,129
- It looks unnatural.
- Why don't you come this way?

1356
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:45,529
- Cameras aren't here.
- Here...

1357
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:46,698
- Hello, Sae Ho.
- But I see cameras.

1358
00:46:46,698 --> 00:46:48,069
- They aren't here?
- Pretend they don't exist.

1359
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:49,229
- Pretend they aren't here.
- This is my agent.

1360
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:50,269
My gosh. Hello.

1361
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:52,309
- He's my junior comedian.
- It's nice to meet you.

1362
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:54,538
- Let's sit down.
- Take a seat.

1363
00:46:54,669 --> 00:46:56,069
But why did you wear Eun I's pants?

1364
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:57,538
They aren't Eun I's. They are mine.

1365
00:46:57,939 --> 00:46:59,808
- These are Eun I's.
- I wore them to your show once.

1366
00:46:59,808 --> 00:47:01,379
- No, they belong to her.
- I...

1367
00:47:01,408 --> 00:47:02,479
- Honey.
- Yes?

1368
00:47:02,479 --> 00:47:04,178
Your beanie is about to fall off.

1369
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,718
- What if this happens?
- It might come off.

1370
00:47:05,718 --> 00:47:06,919
- Honey.
- It might come off.

1371
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:07,919
What if it comes off?

1372
00:47:07,919 --> 00:47:09,288
- What if this happens?
- Coming off.

1373
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,558
The microphone.

1374
00:47:10,758 --> 00:47:12,258
Honey, we won't be here for long.

1375
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:14,018
Don't put it on you. Just hold it, and talk.

1376
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,065
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Why don't you sit down?

1377
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:17,098
Stop it, and sit down.

1378
00:47:17,098 --> 00:47:18,674
(It's time to have coffee with these warmhearted members.)

1379
00:47:18,698 --> 00:47:20,169
They keep calling me.

1380
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:21,368
- Who?
- Who? They called you, right?

1381
00:47:21,368 --> 00:47:24,738
But if I tell you, am I violating the rule?

1382
00:47:24,738 --> 00:47:26,209
- This wasn't supposed to happen.
- This is good.

1383
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,939
If people called him, they probably found out we were coming.

1384
00:47:28,939 --> 00:47:30,508
- You told them, didn't you?
- Did you tell them?

1385
00:47:30,508 --> 00:47:31,709
Let me tell you the whole story.

1386
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:33,549
- Let's pick someone else.
- You shouldn't have done that.

1387
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:34,779
You shouldn't have told them.

1388
00:47:34,779 --> 00:47:36,819
- You told them?
- Hold on a second.

1389
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:38,649
- How can't you not pick on this?
- Wait. I... Hold on.

1390
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,689
Let's be frank. You came to see me.

1391
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:43,189
- You can't do that, Sae Ho.
- I told you we were coming.

1392
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:44,419
You weren't supposed to tell them about us.

1393
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:46,459
- You shouldn't have done that.
- When we watch the show later...

1394
00:47:46,459 --> 00:47:49,859
- You just ruined the whole episode.
- I ruined the episode?

1395
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,029
- Look.
- It's all because of you.

1396
00:47:52,029 --> 00:47:53,868
- No, listen.
- It was supposed to be a secret.

1397
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:57,038
You called me when I was enjoying my day off.

1398
00:47:57,238 --> 00:47:59,738
- You asked me where I was.
- Sae Ho, you can't say that.

1399
00:47:59,738 --> 00:48:00,868
- Sae Ho.
- You should eat some.

1400
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:02,109
What's on your agenda today?

1401
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:05,538
- I'm leaving for Busan at 6pm.
- Why?

1402
00:48:05,538 --> 00:48:06,879
- I have a filming.
- For what?

1403
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:08,709
- Well, it's for a commercial.
- For fun?

1404
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:09,848
(Feeling smug)

1405
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,879
- You're filming it in Busan?
- Yes, I am.

1406
00:48:12,718 --> 00:48:14,249
Should we move to a place where you can do your mission?

1407
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:15,618
- I think we should.
- Sae Ho.

1408
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:17,634
- Wait. We're going somewhere?
- Are you good at...

1409
00:48:17,658 --> 00:48:20,298
- Wait. We're going somewhere?
- Are you good at bowling? Are you?

1410
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,328
- My gosh, I am...
- Have you ever bowled before?

1411
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:25,399
Known as Bowling Cho.

1412
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:28,069
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1413
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:30,114
- Are you good at bowling?
- Do you know how to bowl?

1414
00:48:30,138 --> 00:48:31,198
- Really?
- Yes.

1415
00:48:31,198 --> 00:48:32,598
Before we go to a bowling alley,

1416
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:35,308
tell us the date of your birth and the time you were born.

1417
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:36,879
- Even the time he was born?
- Seriously?

1418
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:38,238
The time I was born?

1419
00:48:39,379 --> 00:48:42,408
I don't know for sure,

1420
00:48:42,808 --> 00:48:44,218
but if my memory serves me right,

1421
00:48:44,218 --> 00:48:46,948
I remember it to be between 6am to 8am.

1422
00:48:46,988 --> 00:48:48,218
- I see.
- It must've been hard for your mom.

1423
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:51,488
- My mom had a C-section.
- I see.

1424
00:48:51,788 --> 00:48:54,428
- It must've been hard.
- It must've been hard for your mom.

1425
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:57,058
Now that I look at you,

1426
00:48:57,158 --> 00:49:00,229
I can see that your mom had a C-section.

1427
00:49:00,698 --> 00:49:02,375
- Your face is fitting.
- What do you mean?

1428
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,069
- It looks like it was a C-section.
- What kind of face would that be?

1429
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:05,198
- I can see that in your face.
- It's not that.

1430
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:07,008
- There's a particular look for it?
- Yes.

1431
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,669
Hey, Jong Kook.

1432
00:49:08,669 --> 00:49:10,508
- There's a look for C-sections.
- That's insulting.

1433
00:49:10,508 --> 00:49:11,508
- I'm serious.
- I'm sorry,

1434
00:49:11,508 --> 00:49:12,908
but did I offend you?

1435
00:49:13,178 --> 00:49:15,609
- We had a nice talk two days ago.
- Yes, we did.

1436
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:18,779
- I cherish him as my friend.
- Exactly. That's why.

1437
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:21,118
- Why don't we get going first?
- Come with us.

1438
00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:23,019
Can I just go like this?

1439
00:49:23,019 --> 00:49:24,158
- Yes.
- Of course, you can.

1440
00:49:24,158 --> 00:49:26,518
(They head to the bowling alley due to his tight schedule.)

1441
00:49:26,988 --> 00:49:28,859
I find myself in this van all of a sudden.

1442
00:49:29,288 --> 00:49:30,959
- What?
- I'm suddenly in this van.

1443
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:33,269
- Yes, you are.
- I don't know what's happening.

1444
00:49:33,569 --> 00:49:35,598
- That's true.
- I must clarify one thing.

1445
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:36,799
You said...

1446
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:38,638
I borrowed 1,500 dollars from you, but it's not true.

1447
00:49:38,638 --> 00:49:39,738
- What?
- I never borrowed any money.

1448
00:49:39,738 --> 00:49:40,738
You didn't?

1449
00:49:40,738 --> 00:49:42,339
- I never borrowed any money.
- Really?

1450
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:43,439
Try to remember.

1451
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,109
One day, he asked me...

1452
00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:47,149
to give some money to someone as a wedding gift for him.

1453
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:49,178
He said he didn't have money at that moment...

1454
00:49:49,178 --> 00:49:50,379
and promised he'd pay me back the next day.

1455
00:49:50,379 --> 00:49:52,078
But when I arrived at the wedding,

1456
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:54,189
they didn't accept any gifts.

1457
00:49:54,189 --> 00:49:57,459
I told Jae Seok that they didn't accept any gifts,

1458
00:49:57,459 --> 00:50:00,459
and he told me to return the money to him.

1459
00:50:01,529 --> 00:50:03,029
What kind of logic is that?

1460
00:50:03,198 --> 00:50:04,758
I was...

1461
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:07,328
No. Honey, think about it.

1462
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:08,399
What did I say?

1463
00:50:08,399 --> 00:50:11,098
Let's say I asked you to give them 100 dollars for me.

1464
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:12,908
- And you went to the wedding.
- I did.

1465
00:50:13,169 --> 00:50:15,069
- You had 100 dollars, right?
- Yes.

1466
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,638
Should you return the money to me or not?

1467
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:17,979
- I should.
- Right?

1468
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:19,979
That's why you owe me 100 dollars.

1469
00:50:20,149 --> 00:50:22,649
- Tell me your account number.
- Okay.

1470
00:50:22,649 --> 00:50:23,718
Right?

1471
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,678
Like I always say,

1472
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:28,448
he would've been a thug had he been good at fighting.

1473
00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:29,788
Seriously.

1474
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:30,959
Luckily, he's bad at fighting.

1475
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:32,788
You can't have everything.

1476
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:33,788
No one can have everything.

1477
00:50:33,788 --> 00:50:34,859
He's scary.

1478
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:36,859
- You can't have everything.
- No.

1479
00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:39,899
Luckily, Jae Seok has cotton fists.

1480
00:50:40,229 --> 00:50:42,569
- Right.
- I'm sorry to say this.

1481
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:44,138
I really appreciate that you came today.

1482
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,839
But you shouldn't...

1483
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,669
- dream of staying here.
- No.

1484
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,538
You know me.

1485
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:53,209
- I do.
- I love watching Running Man.

1486
00:50:53,209 --> 00:50:55,249
Whenever you invite me,

1487
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:56,819
I have so much fun.

1488
00:50:57,178 --> 00:50:58,779
- But...
- But you don't want to stay?

1489
00:50:58,779 --> 00:50:59,948
Just stay quiet.

1490
00:50:59,948 --> 00:51:02,089
You can leave after the bowling game.

1491
00:51:02,089 --> 00:51:03,758
- If...
- Be quiet.

1492
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:05,718
- If we...
- Stop talking.

1493
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:07,658
- From the spring...
- Stop talking.

1494
00:51:07,658 --> 00:51:09,189
- We can...
- Be quiet.

1495
00:51:11,598 --> 00:51:13,868
- I didn't mean to...
- Please be quiet.

1496
00:51:13,968 --> 00:51:15,269
You're talking too much.

1497
00:51:15,468 --> 00:51:18,839
(I can't talk? You guys called me.)

1498
00:51:22,008 --> 00:51:24,339
It feels like I'm being arrested.

1499
00:51:25,479 --> 00:51:29,109
(Sae Ho is taken to the bowling alley by the friendly guys.)

1500
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:32,718
(Haha and So Min are waiting for Young Eun.)

1501
00:51:32,718 --> 00:51:33,888
Let's greet her cheerfully.

1502
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:35,589
(They're ready to welcome her.)

1503
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:36,618
Is she here?

1504
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:38,959
- Hi.
- Look who's here.

1505
00:51:38,959 --> 00:51:41,988
- Hi.
- You haven't changed a bit.

1506
00:51:42,288 --> 00:51:43,459
My goodness.

1507
00:51:43,459 --> 00:51:44,658
(Lee Young Eun)

1508
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:51,738
(She's shown off her charms in many dramas and variety shows.)

1509
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:54,238
(She appeared on a variety show with Haha in 2004.)

1510
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:56,808
I'm so happy to see her. It's amazing.

1511
00:51:56,808 --> 00:51:59,038
I can't believe she's here.

1512
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,078
I can't believe it either.

1513
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:03,649
She used to be on many variety shows.

1514
00:52:03,649 --> 00:52:04,779
That's right.

1515
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:06,718
I used to see you on TV.

1516
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:07,788
- Exactly.
- Really?

1517
00:52:07,788 --> 00:52:08,919
My goodness.

1518
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:10,118
What should I do?

1519
00:52:10,118 --> 00:52:13,428
- It's embarrassing.
- She was popular among celebrities.

1520
00:52:13,428 --> 00:52:14,629
- Really?
- Yes.

1521
00:52:14,629 --> 00:52:15,928
That's what I heard too.

1522
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:17,799
That's what I heard too.

1523
00:52:18,459 --> 00:52:19,529
I'm joking.

1524
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:21,029
(She's still funny.)

1525
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:23,538
You're done casting a guest.

1526
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:25,368
(Haha and So Min has cast Young Eun.)

1527
00:52:25,368 --> 00:52:26,439
She's the best.

1528
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:28,669
There's something we need to check.

1529
00:52:28,669 --> 00:52:30,114
(Where does she stand in terms of age?)

1530
00:52:30,138 --> 00:52:32,779
- You were born on August 9, 1982.
- Yes.

1531
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:33,948
What time were you born?

1532
00:52:33,948 --> 00:52:35,649
We need to know the time.

1533
00:52:35,649 --> 00:52:38,649
(As she was born on the same day as Sae Ho, the time is important.)

1534
00:52:38,649 --> 00:52:43,618
(They're going to pretend Young Eun was born later.)

1535
00:52:43,959 --> 00:52:48,828
(Don't forget you were born at 11:59pm.)

1536
00:52:48,928 --> 00:52:51,158
(What time?)

1537
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:55,669
(Say the answer we agreed on.)

1538
00:52:56,098 --> 00:52:59,439
(Say you were born at 11:59pm.)

1539
00:52:59,439 --> 00:53:02,169
I was born at 12:20am.

1540
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,879
(12:20am?)

1541
00:53:05,879 --> 00:53:08,209
They were trying to...

1542
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:10,819
- make me say something else.
- We weren't.

1543
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:12,988
Let's do this again. Please say it clearly.

1544
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:15,089
- What time were you born?
- 11:50pm.

1545
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,758
12:20am.

1546
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:19,629
- 12:20am?
- No. 11:50pm.

1547
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:20,959
- Young Eun.
- 11:50pm.

1548
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:21,959
- Hold on.
- Really?

1549
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:23,058
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

1550
00:53:23,058 --> 00:53:24,129
Stop shooting.

1551
00:53:24,428 --> 00:53:26,468
- 1, 2, 3.
- Sorry.

1552
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:29,738
The thing is...

1553
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:32,069
(The thing is...)

1554
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:33,839
We need you to have been born at that time.

1555
00:53:33,968 --> 00:53:35,308
Why?

1556
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:37,308
Because you were.

1557
00:53:38,379 --> 00:53:40,178
You were born at 11:50pm.

1558
00:53:40,348 --> 00:53:41,408
Really?

1559
00:53:41,408 --> 00:53:43,948
But I can't change the time I was born.

1560
00:53:43,948 --> 00:53:45,249
- It's okay.
- You're not changing anything.

1561
00:53:45,249 --> 00:53:46,888
We've already talked to your mom.

1562
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:49,388
- Your mom...
- Yes.

1563
00:53:49,388 --> 00:53:50,988
It's what your family register says.

1564
00:53:50,988 --> 00:53:53,189
- I don't know what happened.
- We've checked.

1565
00:53:53,328 --> 00:53:54,988
Your guest was born...

1566
00:53:54,988 --> 00:53:58,058
on August 9, 1982, at 12:20am...

1567
00:53:58,058 --> 00:54:00,529
- No!
- No!

1568
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,928
Please say it.

1569
00:54:01,928 --> 00:54:03,868
She didn't say, "Start."

1570
00:54:03,868 --> 00:54:04,939
She didn't.

1571
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:06,908
Say, "Start," and then what time you were born.

1572
00:54:06,968 --> 00:54:08,408
1, 2, 3.

1573
00:54:08,408 --> 00:54:09,439
Start.

1574
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:11,339
(Innocent)

1575
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:12,908
- 12:20am.
- No.

1576
00:54:12,908 --> 00:54:14,448
Start. 12:20am.

1577
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:15,508
No.

1578
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:16,519
(Young Eun was born at 12:20am.)

1579
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,118
- I can't lie.
- Gosh.

1580
00:54:18,118 --> 00:54:19,149
Ma'am.

1581
00:54:19,149 --> 00:54:20,218
(She's stubborn.)

1582
00:54:20,448 --> 00:54:22,488
Let me announce the result.

1583
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:24,919
Your guest, Young Eun,

1584
00:54:24,919 --> 00:54:27,189
was born on August 9, 1982,

1585
00:54:27,189 --> 00:54:30,158
at 12:20am.

1586
00:54:30,158 --> 00:54:31,158
Gosh.

1587
00:54:31,158 --> 00:54:32,399
(If she's the oldest, they'll fail to win points.)

1588
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:34,468
Among all the guests,

1589
00:54:35,368 --> 00:54:37,999
she's the second oldest. Therefore, you win 20 points.

1590
00:54:38,138 --> 00:54:41,439
(She's the 2nd oldest?)

1591
00:54:41,508 --> 00:54:42,709
Gosh.

1592
00:54:42,709 --> 00:54:46,178
(As Young Eun was born a few hours earlier, they win 20 points.)

1593
00:54:46,178 --> 00:54:47,408
She was born at 12:20am.

1594
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:50,118
We're not supposed to lie.

1595
00:54:50,118 --> 00:54:52,819
- Her mom was right.
- She was born at 12:20am.

1596
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:55,019
- She was born at 12:20am.
- That's right.

1597
00:54:55,348 --> 00:54:56,819
Look at this.

1598
00:54:56,888 --> 00:54:58,258
- I have goosebumps.
- Young Eun.

1599
00:54:58,258 --> 00:54:59,288
- See?
- What's going on?

1600
00:54:59,288 --> 00:55:01,558
Justice prevails, and truth is revealed.

1601
00:55:01,558 --> 00:55:02,999
- Of course.
- The world is still beautiful.

1602
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,058
Of course.

1603
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:05,899
I can't believe she was born at 12:20am.

1604
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:07,328
Bless you.

1605
00:55:07,468 --> 00:55:09,468
We'd like to thank your mother.

1606
00:55:09,468 --> 00:55:11,368
We thank your mother. Seriously.

1607
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:12,939
(It means Sae Ho is the 3rd oldest.)

1608
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:14,538
The second oldest was...

1609
00:55:14,538 --> 00:55:17,738
- It must be us. - born on August 9, 1982.

1610
00:55:17,738 --> 00:55:20,049
Lee Young Eun was born at 12:20am.

1611
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:22,448
Young Eun and I are the same age.

1612
00:55:22,448 --> 00:55:25,819
The third oldest is Sae Ho, who was born between 6am and 8am.

1613
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:28,819
- Why were you born so late?
- Young Eun was born on August 9?

1614
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:29,859
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook win 10 points.)

1615
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:31,488
- This is...
- I can't believe it.

1616
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:32,618
How is this possible?

1617
00:55:32,618 --> 00:55:35,558
Hong Jin Young was born on August 9 too.

1618
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:36,859
Why were you born so late?

1619
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:38,698
(What?)

1620
00:55:38,698 --> 00:55:40,428
If you had been born earlier,

1621
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:42,669
- we would have won 20 points.
- Jong Kook, that's...

1622
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:46,368
You're talking about what happened 37 years ago.

1623
00:55:46,508 --> 00:55:49,578
How could I have predicted this 37 years ago?

1624
00:55:49,578 --> 00:55:51,879
He was born through C-section.

1625
00:55:51,879 --> 00:55:54,408
- We lost because of the time.
- Please apologize to my mom.

1626
00:55:54,609 --> 00:55:56,218
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

1627
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:57,755
- But if...
- We were rude to his mother.

1628
00:55:57,779 --> 00:55:59,448
It was too close.

1629
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:00,919
He's here.

1630
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:03,558
(We now know who the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th oldest guests are.)

1631
00:56:03,558 --> 00:56:04,558
Hi.

1632
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:07,959
(Who is the oldest guest?)

1633
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:09,058
(Lee Jong Hyuk)

1634
00:56:09,058 --> 00:56:11,359
Actor Lee Jong Hyuk is here.

1635
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:15,299
(He's been in many dramas, variety shows, and musicals.)

1636
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:17,499
(The handsomest, middle-aged actor)

1637
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:21,169
Let me announce the result.

1638
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,678
I think I'll be the oldest.

1639
00:56:23,678 --> 00:56:25,638
What are you talking about? You're young.

1640
00:56:25,638 --> 00:56:26,779
How old are you?

1641
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:28,549
He's just 44 or 45.

1642
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:31,649
Your guest is the oldest.

1643
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:33,718
Your guest is the oldest.

1644
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:35,689
(Laughing)

1645
00:56:35,689 --> 00:56:37,258
You've failed to win points.

1646
00:56:37,658 --> 00:56:40,459
I feel offended.

1647
00:56:40,459 --> 00:56:41,459
Exactly.

1648
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:43,558
Can I have more ice?

1649
00:56:43,558 --> 00:56:45,928
- What's going on?
- It's hot in here.

1650
00:56:45,928 --> 00:56:48,169
He's only in his early 40s.

1651
00:56:48,368 --> 00:56:49,939
He's in his early 40s.

1652
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:52,169
Shouldn't the oldest guest win more points?

1653
00:56:52,169 --> 00:56:54,238
- It's hard to be the oldest.
- It's hard.

1654
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:57,709
- Jung Min...
- Order juice.

1655
00:56:57,779 --> 00:56:59,415
- He doesn't drink coffee?
- Please give us another juice.

1656
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:02,508
I'll make sure Jung Min gets the Korean beef set.

1657
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:03,578
(When is he coming?)

1658
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:05,749
He can't? Is it him on that motorbike?

1659
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:07,749
Really?

1660
00:57:07,988 --> 00:57:11,519
(A motorbike approaches.)

1661
00:57:12,089 --> 00:57:15,359
He's making eye contact with us. Is it him?

1662
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,459
Is he coming on a motorbike?

1663
00:57:16,459 --> 00:57:18,698
- I don't know.
- Could it really be him?

1664
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,698
You should go out. I think it's him.

1665
00:57:20,698 --> 00:57:24,198
(Is he just someone the cafe owner knows?)

1666
00:57:24,198 --> 00:57:26,238
I think it's Jung Min. Stop him.

1667
00:57:26,538 --> 00:57:28,008
- Is it him?
- Is it him?

1668
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:29,138
Is it Jung Min?

1669
00:57:29,308 --> 00:57:31,178
He came with a motorbike?

1670
00:57:31,379 --> 00:57:32,839
- It's him.
- He came with a motorbike.

1671
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:33,879
(A man approaches the cafe.)

1672
00:57:33,879 --> 00:57:35,649
(He has the aura of an actor.)

1673
00:57:35,649 --> 00:57:37,249
He has blond hair.

1674
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:39,448
(It was you?)

1675
00:57:39,448 --> 00:57:41,019
He dresses very casually.

1676
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:42,488
- He came with a motorbike?
- Hi.

1677
00:57:42,488 --> 00:57:43,589
Hi.

1678
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,089
(Actor Park Jung Min is here.)

1679
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,888
(His acting gives you shivers.)

1680
00:57:48,888 --> 00:57:53,529
(Park Jung Min is a genius actor who can pull off various roles.)

1681
00:57:54,629 --> 00:57:56,169
(Bowing)

1682
00:57:56,169 --> 00:57:57,299
We didn't think it was you.

1683
00:57:57,299 --> 00:57:59,238
I couldn't park my motorbike there.

1684
00:57:59,238 --> 00:58:01,415
(The cafe owner didn't let him park his motorbike there.)

1685
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:03,138
You guys could've talked it out.

1686
00:58:03,408 --> 00:58:05,109
He had to...

1687
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:06,578
- park somewhere else.
- This way.

1688
00:58:06,578 --> 00:58:07,979
Please put on a microphone.

1689
00:58:08,209 --> 00:58:09,578
(Puzzled)

1690
00:58:09,578 --> 00:58:11,919
Is this a serious shoot?

1691
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:13,324
You haven't seen each other in a while?

1692
00:58:13,348 --> 00:58:15,488
- It's been a while.
- When did we last meet?

1693
00:58:15,488 --> 00:58:17,388
(His back is facing the camera.)

1694
00:58:17,388 --> 00:58:19,788
- It's been a couple of months.
- A couple of months?

1695
00:58:19,788 --> 00:58:20,928
Please come here.

1696
00:58:20,928 --> 00:58:22,359
Come this way.

1697
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:24,299
Jung Min doesn't have a lot of experience.

1698
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,459
(Please understand.)

1699
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:28,569
(He's not used to variety shows.)

1700
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:29,899
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

1701
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:30,899
What's going on?

1702
00:58:30,899 --> 00:58:31,939
- Have a seat.
- Have a seat.

1703
00:58:31,939 --> 00:58:33,109
- We don't know either.
- We don't know.

1704
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:34,138
Let's hear it.

1705
00:58:34,138 --> 00:58:36,279
- I'm not even wearing makeup.
- He hasn't changed a bit.

1706
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:37,439
(I'm wearing no makeup.)

1707
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:42,479
(Jung Min is here, but the team doesn't win any points.)

1708
00:58:42,479 --> 00:58:46,348
(Result)

1709
00:58:47,488 --> 00:58:49,348
Let me give you a mission.

1710
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:51,919
Your mission is called...

1711
00:58:51,919 --> 00:58:53,758
Play, Eat, Shop.

1712
00:58:53,758 --> 00:58:55,288
Play, Eat, Shop?

1713
00:58:55,288 --> 00:58:59,258
You're going to play, eat, and shop...

1714
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:00,968
the way Young Eun wants.

1715
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:06,339
If you succeed, Young Eun will win a Korean beef set.

1716
00:59:06,738 --> 00:59:07,738
(Korean beef?)

1717
00:59:07,738 --> 00:59:08,769
Let's do this.

1718
00:59:08,769 --> 00:59:11,209
Here is Haha's mission bag.

1719
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:12,379
Thank you.

1720
00:59:12,379 --> 00:59:13,848
This is So Min's.

1721
00:59:13,848 --> 00:59:17,218
(There is a secret hidden in these bags.)

1722
00:59:17,218 --> 00:59:23,288
(Haha and So Min hears about the mission.)

1723
00:59:23,288 --> 00:59:29,529
(They're given only 10 dollars...)

1724
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,658
(for the Play, Eat, Shop mission.)

1725
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:35,499
(3 activities with 10 dollars?)

1726
00:59:35,598 --> 00:59:38,439
On top of that, you have a hidden mission.

1727
00:59:38,638 --> 00:59:40,939
You'll get a bag for your mission.

1728
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:42,808
There's a pedometer hidden in the bag.

1729
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:44,779
That darn pedometer.

1730
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:48,749
When the mission is finished,

1731
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:51,019
the total of the 3 pedometers must be less than 10,000 to win.

1732
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:53,488
If it's over 10,000, you fail.

1733
00:59:55,549 --> 01:00:01,729
(The amount spent and steps must be less than 10,000.)

1734
01:00:03,859 --> 01:00:06,428
You may eat what you'd like.

1735
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:08,968
- We'll treat you to coffee...
- Right now?

1736
01:00:08,968 --> 01:00:11,468
- Like we said.
- I'd like iced coffee.

1737
01:00:11,468 --> 01:00:13,638
Okay, come with me.

1738
01:00:13,638 --> 01:00:15,439
Shall I order it? Would you like to stay?

1739
01:00:15,439 --> 01:00:17,178
Shall we bring it to you?

1740
01:00:17,209 --> 01:00:19,578
- Would you like to come?
- Sure.

1741
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:21,279
Hello.

1742
01:00:21,279 --> 01:00:23,149
One iced Americano, please.

1743
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:25,218
- Hello.
- I'd like water, So Min.

1744
01:00:26,019 --> 01:00:27,388
Water with ice.

1745
01:00:27,388 --> 01:00:29,189
Please give me a glass of iced water.

1746
01:00:29,488 --> 01:00:31,758
I can't sleep well if I drink coffee.

1747
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:33,758
Her heart starts to beat fast.

1748
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:35,158
I feel bad.

1749
01:00:35,158 --> 01:00:37,098
- I won't get a drink.
- It's okay.

1750
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:39,098
- We promised you.
- I'm sorry.

1751
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:40,669
- Is it two iced Americano?
- Yes.

1752
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:42,698
- No, it's 1.
- It's 1.

1753
01:00:43,198 --> 01:00:44,468
- How much is it?
- It's 3.80 dollars.

1754
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:46,169
- 3.80 dollars?
- Yes.

1755
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:47,908
(They spend 3.80 dollars.)

1756
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:49,237
- Is hot Americano cheaper?
- Is it one cup?

1757
01:00:49,237 --> 01:00:51,078
Is hot Americano cheaper? How about a hot drink?

1758
01:00:51,078 --> 01:00:53,308
- It's too hot.
- One iced Americano, please.

1759
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:04,636
(When they make a bet, )

1760
01:01:04,636 --> 01:01:07,977
(Haha bets on success.)

1761
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:09,776
(You really wrote "success".)

1762
01:01:09,946 --> 01:01:12,047
(So Min bets on success.)

1763
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,547
(He crosses it out.)

1764
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:17,317
(He quickly crosses out success.)

1765
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,417
(Haha bets on failure.)

1766
01:01:22,187 --> 01:01:25,457
(So Min bets on success. Haha bets on failure.)

1767
01:01:26,026 --> 01:01:28,127
Is it the price of the ice?

1768
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:31,326
- Yes.
- It's 30 cents more expensive.

1769
01:01:31,326 --> 01:01:33,497
We'll order iced coffee.

1770
01:01:33,497 --> 01:01:36,236
- Thank you.
- I don't usually buy it.

1771
01:01:36,236 --> 01:01:37,567
(Only one coffee arrives.)

1772
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:41,236
- Let's share it.
- I'll drink water.

1773
01:01:41,236 --> 01:01:43,446
- I don't drink coffee.
- We drank a lot before.

1774
01:01:43,446 --> 01:01:44,776
Really? Can I drink it?

1775
01:01:44,776 --> 01:01:46,676
- Of course.
- It's really okay.

1776
01:01:46,776 --> 01:01:48,747
I prefer water.

1777
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:49,946
What do you want to do today?

1778
01:01:50,517 --> 01:01:51,517
Do you like to exercise?

1779
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:53,156
- No.
- You don't?

1780
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:55,457
Taking care of a baby...

1781
01:01:55,457 --> 01:01:57,056
can feel suffocating.

1782
01:01:57,056 --> 01:01:58,127
- Didn't I tell you?
- How about seeing cherry blossoms?

1783
01:01:58,127 --> 01:01:59,926
- What? Cherry blossoms?
- Seeing cherry blossoms?

1784
01:01:59,926 --> 01:02:01,426
(Cherry blossoms?)

1785
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:03,227
That sounds amazing.

1786
01:02:03,227 --> 01:02:05,526
- Do you mean taking photos?
- Yes.

1787
01:02:05,797 --> 01:02:07,037
That's amazing.

1788
01:02:07,437 --> 01:02:09,236
We can throw cherry blossoms too.

1789
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:11,466
- We can take portraits.
- Right.

1790
01:02:11,736 --> 01:02:13,506
This is popular these days.

1791
01:02:13,607 --> 01:02:14,937
I want to go to an amusement park.

1792
01:02:14,937 --> 01:02:16,047
Amusement park?

1793
01:02:16,047 --> 01:02:18,047
(I want to go to an amusement park.)

1794
01:02:18,107 --> 01:02:20,946
(That costs so much.)

1795
01:02:21,547 --> 01:02:22,846
I saw this in the playground.

1796
01:02:22,846 --> 01:02:25,587
Right, there was a merry-go-round.

1797
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:26,886
There were bars too.

1798
01:02:26,886 --> 01:02:29,357
Is it okay for me to say it?

1799
01:02:29,357 --> 01:02:31,687
- Pardon? Massage?
- I also want a massage.

1800
01:02:31,687 --> 01:02:33,397
- Haha.
- She has a massage license.

1801
01:02:33,397 --> 01:02:34,426
- No.
- Seriously.

1802
01:02:34,426 --> 01:02:36,426
- I don't mean that.
- It's true.

1803
01:02:36,497 --> 01:02:39,696
She's really good at giving massages.

1804
01:02:39,696 --> 01:02:41,096
Would you like to buy anything?

1805
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,636
I saw a pair of jeans yesterday.

1806
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,377
A pair of jeans?

1807
01:02:46,736 --> 01:02:48,906
She's wearing jeans.

1808
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:51,207
The color was neon pink.

1809
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:54,147
Neon pink? What did you say? I'm sorry.

1810
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:55,877
(He almost loses his temper.)

1811
01:02:55,877 --> 01:02:57,147
(Pink pants are popular.)

1812
01:02:57,147 --> 01:03:00,017
I'm sorry. We saw each other after a long time.

1813
01:03:00,357 --> 01:03:03,526
I'd like to hear about your everyday life.

1814
01:03:03,526 --> 01:03:05,556
I'm sure you have things to do.

1815
01:03:05,556 --> 01:03:07,426
- Here it is.
- Go ahead.

1816
01:03:07,596 --> 01:03:09,767
My four-year-old child goes to...

1817
01:03:09,767 --> 01:03:11,196
- preschool.
- Do you get up early?

1818
01:03:11,196 --> 01:03:13,196
- I wake up at 8am.
- 8am?

1819
01:03:13,196 --> 01:03:14,397
I get up around then.

1820
01:03:14,667 --> 01:03:16,866
- So...
- Do you do laundry every day?

1821
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:18,707
(He shakes the pedometer.)

1822
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:21,837
Don't you clean up every day?

1823
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:23,247
Right, I do everything.

1824
01:03:23,247 --> 01:03:25,506
Your children must get up and cry.

1825
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:27,977
- Right, however...
- That's difficult.

1826
01:03:28,446 --> 01:03:30,647
Your face hasn't changed much.

1827
01:03:30,647 --> 01:03:31,986
Yours didn't either.

1828
01:03:31,986 --> 01:03:33,306
- Seriously.
- You look the same.

1829
01:03:35,116 --> 01:03:37,156
Let's decide on what to do today.

1830
01:03:37,156 --> 01:03:39,056
- We got her a drink.
- That sounds good.

1831
01:03:39,056 --> 01:03:40,096
Do you remember?

1832
01:03:40,196 --> 01:03:42,026
This mission must be done with 10 dollars.

1833
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,797
What did you want to do?

1834
01:03:43,797 --> 01:03:47,236
- I want to go to an amusement park.
- Amusement park or...

1835
01:03:47,236 --> 01:03:49,866
(Was that the condition?)

1836
01:03:50,537 --> 01:03:52,877
I'm sorry to ask,

1837
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:55,236
but could you give me a few drops of coffee in here?

1838
01:03:55,236 --> 01:03:56,247
(Speaking of which...)

1839
01:03:56,247 --> 01:03:57,707
(He doesn't want to buy one.)

1840
01:03:57,707 --> 01:03:59,747
I want to smell it.

1841
01:03:59,747 --> 01:04:00,977
(He doesn't have much money.)

1842
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:03,147
Thank you so much.

1843
01:04:03,147 --> 01:04:04,417
My goodness.

1844
01:04:04,687 --> 01:04:06,187
I can see its color.

1845
01:04:06,216 --> 01:04:07,317
Thank you.

1846
01:04:07,317 --> 01:04:08,716
(Each drop is precious.)

1847
01:04:08,716 --> 01:04:11,426
- You should have told me.
- It's okay.

1848
01:04:11,426 --> 01:04:13,596
- I feel too pressured.
- Don't be.

1849
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:15,526
- It tastes like coffee.
- Really?

1850
01:04:15,826 --> 01:04:17,696
- Goodness.
- This is amazing.

1851
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,437
Yes, it's perfect right now.

1852
01:04:20,937 --> 01:04:22,806
Do you want to go to an amusement park?

1853
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:24,067
Let's go to Children's Grand Park.

1854
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:25,977
- Children's Grand Park?
- There are rides...

1855
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:28,617
like the pirate ship ride called The Vikings. I want to ride that.

1856
01:04:28,736 --> 01:04:30,406
- That sounds good.
- The Vikings?

1857
01:04:30,406 --> 01:04:32,817
Can you afford a ticket to the park?

1858
01:04:32,817 --> 01:04:34,276
It's free.

1859
01:04:34,576 --> 01:04:36,147
- It's free to enter.
- Yes.

1860
01:04:36,147 --> 01:04:37,616
Okay, let's go.

1861
01:04:37,616 --> 01:04:39,817
We'll go and make sure you ride The Vikings.

1862
01:04:39,817 --> 01:04:41,857
- We'll make sure of it.
- No matter what.

1863
01:04:41,857 --> 01:04:43,826
- Let's go.
- Let's go. This is great.

1864
01:04:45,227 --> 01:04:48,696
Here's the team mission you'll clear with Jung Min.

1865
01:04:48,797 --> 01:04:50,297
It's called 3 Flipping Sets.

1866
01:04:50,297 --> 01:04:51,526
(3 Flipping Sets)

1867
01:04:52,026 --> 01:04:54,437
(Flipping puck ddakji, paper ddakji, and business card)

1868
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:58,306
If you clear the mission, we'll give a Korean beef gift set to Jung Min.

1869
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:01,328
(Clearing 2 out of 3 missions gives Jung Min a Korean beef gift set.)

1870
01:05:01,477 --> 01:05:04,247
You can grill it tonight at home.

1871
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:05,806
It was his birthday recently.

1872
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:07,776
- Consider it as your birthday gift.
- Right.

1873
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:11,547
The first mission is flipping puck ddakji.

1874
01:05:11,547 --> 01:05:12,547
(Flipping puck ddakji)

1875
01:05:13,017 --> 01:05:14,386
You get only one chance.

1876
01:05:14,817 --> 01:05:17,656
You'll play it in a relay. Among 150 pieces of ddakji,

1877
01:05:17,857 --> 01:05:19,656
you must flip over 100 to win.

1878
01:05:19,826 --> 01:05:21,727
It's been a while, so I lost my sense.

1879
01:05:21,957 --> 01:05:23,866
- Flip 100 of 150 pieces.
- Do you mean these?

1880
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:25,267
- Yes.
- This is easy.

1881
01:05:25,767 --> 01:05:26,767
Give it a try, Jung Min.

1882
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:28,797
After practicing, choose an order.

1883
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:29,837
Like this?

1884
01:05:29,937 --> 01:05:31,406
Are you athletic, Jung Min?

1885
01:05:31,707 --> 01:05:33,236
- Yes.
- You're quick, right?

1886
01:05:33,736 --> 01:05:34,736
That's good.

1887
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:35,937
Can you do this?

1888
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:38,806
(He practices with the muscles he gained from boxing.)

1889
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,076
(There's not much change.)

1890
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:44,687
(This isn't it.)

1891
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:46,957
Wait.

1892
01:05:49,056 --> 01:05:51,256
- You're not athletic at all.
- Wait.

1893
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:53,526
Try it again. Think of it as your last chance.

1894
01:05:56,596 --> 01:05:58,196
Can we switch him with someone else?

1895
01:05:58,196 --> 01:06:00,437
Which year did I say?

1896
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:01,797
Didn't I say 1983 or 1984?

1897
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:04,207
- How can you not do this?
- Wait.

1898
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:06,377
- How about six?
- Why can't I do it?

1899
01:06:06,806 --> 01:06:07,977
You didn't flip any.

1900
01:06:10,776 --> 01:06:12,047
I'm done with practice.

1901
01:06:12,047 --> 01:06:14,576
(I'm done with practice.)

1902
01:06:15,616 --> 01:06:17,547
What do you mean? You didn't flip any.

1903
01:06:18,147 --> 01:06:19,756
What are you doing?

1904
01:06:20,056 --> 01:06:22,156
- Kwang Soo.
- We need to score points.

1905
01:06:23,156 --> 01:06:25,127
I'm making it move.

1906
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:26,497
Shall I do it?

1907
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:28,497
Here you go. Try this.

1908
01:06:28,696 --> 01:06:29,897
You try it.

1909
01:06:32,866 --> 01:06:36,136
(About 120 pieces flip.)

1910
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:43,607
(With a heavy blow, the stack of ddakjis collapses.)

1911
01:06:45,276 --> 01:06:46,317
Do it like this.

1912
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:48,877
- Kwang Soo.
- This is it.

1913
01:06:48,877 --> 01:06:50,517
You were an expert.

1914
01:06:50,517 --> 01:06:51,547
- How did you do it?
- You did it.

1915
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:53,917
You can start. These are 150 pieces. You made it.

1916
01:06:53,957 --> 01:06:54,957
May I start right away?

1917
01:06:54,957 --> 01:06:57,057
- Say start, and decide the order.
- You go first.

1918
01:06:57,057 --> 01:06:58,156
Kwang Soo will start.

1919
01:06:58,156 --> 01:07:00,026
- Do you want it lower?
- You should finish it off.

1920
01:07:00,026 --> 01:07:01,797
It's pointless. You have to succeed.

1921
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:02,797
Just finish it in one go.

1922
01:07:03,026 --> 01:07:04,526
Say start before starting.

1923
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:06,037
- 1, 2, 3, start.
- Start.

1924
01:07:07,037 --> 01:07:09,766
(He must flip 100 to win.)

1925
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,307
Aim at the top.

1926
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:14,936
(Please flip 120 pieces like you did before.)

1927
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:18,446
(Will he succeed in the beginning?)

1928
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:24,717
(The blow wasn't as heavy as before.)

1929
01:07:24,717 --> 01:07:26,217
(He can't believe it.)

1930
01:07:26,986 --> 01:07:29,887
Stop playing around. What's wrong with you?

1931
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:31,356
- Is he doing it on purpose?
- What's wrong?

1932
01:07:31,356 --> 01:07:33,127
(Did he do it on purpose?)

1933
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:35,497
(We must bet on success no matter what.)

1934
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:38,866
(They both promise to bet on success.)

1935
01:07:39,997 --> 01:07:41,637
(Se Chan bets on success.)

1936
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:44,866
(Kwang Soo bets on failure as expected.)

1937
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,406
Kwang Soo took his turn. The second player starts.

1938
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:48,807
What have you done?

1939
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:50,446
You give it a try.

1940
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:53,247
- This looks good.
- Blowing diagonally is allowed.

1941
01:07:53,247 --> 01:07:54,247
All right.

1942
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:55,516
(He insists on his own rules.)

1943
01:07:55,516 --> 01:07:58,146
- What's the point of saying that?
- What?

1944
01:07:58,516 --> 01:08:00,516
(He fixes his posture carefully.)

1945
01:08:00,516 --> 01:08:01,717
100 pieces?

1946
01:08:02,557 --> 01:08:03,957
That's more than two-thirds.

1947
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:06,127
(Please fail.)

1948
01:08:07,427 --> 01:08:10,427
(He used to be good at ddakji. Will Se Chan be able to succeed?)

1949
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,436
Okay, okay.

1950
01:08:15,066 --> 01:08:16,106
Okay.

1951
01:08:16,137 --> 01:08:17,606
(What just happened?)

1952
01:08:17,606 --> 01:08:18,906
- You flipped a lot.
- I did.

1953
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:20,207
Let's remove them.

1954
01:08:20,406 --> 01:08:22,576
There's a lot. I did good, right?

1955
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:23,677
I think we made it.

1956
01:08:23,677 --> 01:08:25,247
- I think we got 100.
- We made it.

1957
01:08:25,247 --> 01:08:27,092
I think so too. Give them to me. Let me count them.

1958
01:08:27,116 --> 01:08:29,387
Let's count. 1, 2, 3, 4...

1959
01:08:29,387 --> 01:08:31,816
(His eyes become wider as the numbers go up.)

1960
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:34,116
66, 67, 68, 69.

1961
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:36,826
Okay. You just need 30.

1962
01:08:36,887 --> 01:08:37,957
You only need to flip 31.

1963
01:08:37,957 --> 01:08:39,627
- You can do it.
- You can do 31.

1964
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:41,156
I'm sure you can do 31.

1965
01:08:41,257 --> 01:08:43,066
- I'm sure you can do it.
- Jung Min.

1966
01:08:43,927 --> 01:08:45,167
Bring it close.

1967
01:08:45,326 --> 01:08:47,167
Blow on the bottom.

1968
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:48,544
Do this, okay?

1969
01:08:50,137 --> 01:08:52,307
(Will Jung Min flip 31 of them?)

1970
01:08:53,736 --> 01:08:55,877
(He only gets 4.)

1971
01:08:58,347 --> 01:08:59,547
What was that?

1972
01:09:00,976 --> 01:09:03,316
(He can't hide his sense of relief.)

1973
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:04,616
I got four.

1974
01:09:05,547 --> 01:09:06,816
Four?

1975
01:09:06,816 --> 01:09:07,917
(It's four.)

1976
01:09:08,016 --> 01:09:09,826
You flipped 73 in total.

1977
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,326
You failed the first mission.

1978
01:09:11,326 --> 01:09:13,533
(They flipped 73 in total, so they fail the 1st mission.)

1979
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:14,957
What did you do? Goodness.

1980
01:09:15,997 --> 01:09:18,597
If you fail another mission, this is over,

1981
01:09:18,597 --> 01:09:20,997
and Jung Min will go home empty-handed.

1982
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:25,606
I wanted to get the beef gift set for him. I said it a few times.

1983
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:28,166
(Se Chan has to win, and Kwang Soo has to lose. Who will it be?)

1984
01:09:28,476 --> 01:09:29,976
There are three rounds...

1985
01:09:29,976 --> 01:09:32,547
to the Nice Treasure Hunt.

1986
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:36,146
You must find each member's name tag.

1987
01:09:36,646 --> 01:09:38,486
You have three minutes.

1988
01:09:39,356 --> 01:09:41,787
One Running Man member...

1989
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:44,087
will hide the treasures,

1990
01:09:44,257 --> 01:09:46,526
and one person will find...

1991
01:09:46,526 --> 01:09:48,097
the name tags with Jong Hyuk.

1992
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:49,127
Let's get started.

1993
01:09:50,427 --> 01:09:54,266
- You can hide the name tags now.
- Okay.

1994
01:09:54,436 --> 01:09:57,606
I can hide them wherever I want, right?

1995
01:09:58,266 --> 01:09:59,377
(Did Ji Hyo choose to win or lose?)

1996
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:00,436
What does she have?

1997
01:10:00,677 --> 01:10:02,076
Is it to win or to lose?

1998
01:10:03,177 --> 01:10:04,737
I'm 100-percent sure she wants to lose.

1999
01:10:06,377 --> 01:10:09,247
(On their way to the coffee shop while betting for a win or a loss)

2000
01:10:09,616 --> 01:10:11,287
(He thought she would choose to lose, )

2001
01:10:11,287 --> 01:10:13,087
(and he was right.)

2002
01:10:13,686 --> 01:10:15,757
(What did Seok Jin pick?)

2003
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:17,957
(Win)

2004
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:20,196
I'm 100-percent sure she wants to lose.

2005
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:22,856
What am I supposed to do? I'm going to make her get it.

2006
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:27,396
All right. I'll make this ridiculous.

2007
01:10:28,167 --> 01:10:29,566
You have one minute left.

2008
01:10:30,137 --> 01:10:31,967
She'll find it for sure.

2009
01:10:32,807 --> 01:10:34,507
As soon as she comes through here...

2010
01:10:34,507 --> 01:10:35,807
Right?

2011
01:10:35,837 --> 01:10:37,106
All right.

2012
01:10:39,516 --> 01:10:40,547
This is good.

2013
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:42,347
(He sticks it on the cameraman's chest.)

2014
01:10:43,646 --> 01:10:47,887
(He wants to win, so he'll hide them in obvious places.)

2015
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:51,257
- He's coming.
- Okay.

2016
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:53,057
I'll put this here.

2017
01:10:53,226 --> 01:10:54,356
She has to know.

2018
01:10:54,356 --> 01:10:56,066
(He leaves the last one on a chair by the windows.)

2019
01:10:56,066 --> 01:10:57,696
All right. She will find them for sure.

2020
01:10:57,696 --> 01:11:01,637
(Even if Ji Hyo wants to lose, Jong Hyuk can find them.)

2021
01:11:02,266 --> 01:11:04,967
(I trust you, Jong Hyuk.)

2022
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,236
2, 1.

2023
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:08,877
We're going now?

2024
01:11:09,137 --> 01:11:11,207
- Let's go. We can take our time.
- Hey, run.

2025
01:11:11,207 --> 01:11:13,146
No, it's okay.

2026
01:11:13,146 --> 01:11:16,186
I think he made them obvious, so we can take our time.

2027
01:11:16,186 --> 01:11:17,616
- Of course.
- Do you trust Seok Jin?

2028
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:19,287
Of course, I do.

2029
01:11:19,287 --> 01:11:24,226
(It's in their face from the beginning.)

2030
01:11:24,226 --> 01:11:25,427
(What do I do?)

2031
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:26,696
I don't trust him.

2032
01:11:27,297 --> 01:11:29,156
- It's not this way, right?
- This won't do.

2033
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:33,037
(She tries to sit on it.)

2034
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:36,707
(Why did she just sit down?)

2035
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:38,436
What are you doing?

2036
01:11:39,037 --> 01:11:41,106
(He doesn't suspect anything and leaves.)

2037
01:11:41,106 --> 01:11:43,076
- You're working hard.
- Why isn't she trying?

2038
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:44,707
My shoe lace got untied.

2039
01:11:45,507 --> 01:11:47,146
You want to lose, right?

2040
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:49,347
- No. I want to win.
- Right? You need to lose.

2041
01:11:49,816 --> 01:11:51,316
How does he not realize?

2042
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:54,356
He didn't see that while he was coming up?

2043
01:11:55,486 --> 01:11:57,887
He didn't see that? This is driving me nuts.

2044
01:11:58,127 --> 01:12:00,597
Didn't he see this? It's on your chest.

2045
01:12:00,726 --> 01:12:03,826
Goodness. This is driving me nuts. What is wrong with him?

2046
01:12:04,396 --> 01:12:06,266
I told you to put them where I can see them.

2047
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:11,406
(How much easier can it get?)

2048
01:12:12,507 --> 01:12:14,837
(It even follows you around.)

2049
01:12:15,207 --> 01:12:16,606
(I'm here.)

2050
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,547
(He passes it.)

2051
01:12:19,146 --> 01:12:20,347
Here.

2052
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:21,847
It might be here.

2053
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:24,616
(He's impossible.)

2054
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:26,616
It should be colorful, not white.

2055
01:12:26,616 --> 01:12:29,557
(You just have to turn your head...)

2056
01:12:29,557 --> 01:12:31,326
(to see it.)

2057
01:12:31,326 --> 01:12:32,856
- Hey, Seok Jin.
- Hey.

2058
01:12:34,797 --> 01:12:36,826
You should film me. Film me.

2059
01:12:36,826 --> 01:12:40,667
(He calls out the cameraman and tries to make it obvious.)

2060
01:12:40,667 --> 01:12:43,736
(Will Jong Hyuk notice?)

2061
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:47,007
- Why is this so hard?
- Film me.

2062
01:12:47,837 --> 01:12:50,047
(He complains.)

2063
01:12:51,377 --> 01:12:53,377
I am really bad at finding things.

2064
01:12:53,377 --> 01:12:54,576
Goodness.

2065
01:12:54,646 --> 01:12:56,116
I'm really bad at this.

2066
01:12:56,616 --> 01:12:59,486
You have to look from far away.

2067
01:13:00,356 --> 01:13:02,516
You can't look at the trees. You have to look at the forest.

2068
01:13:02,516 --> 01:13:03,557
It's this way, right?

2069
01:13:03,557 --> 01:13:05,526
(He looks at it widely from this way.)

2070
01:13:05,526 --> 01:13:06,597
I think so.

2071
01:13:06,797 --> 01:13:08,427
I'm actually not sure.

2072
01:13:08,656 --> 01:13:10,127
I don't know what's going on.

2073
01:13:10,226 --> 01:13:12,936
You might think it's weird, but I don't know.

2074
01:13:13,766 --> 01:13:14,896
(Winking)

2075
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:16,866
Ji Hyo, you're so shameless.

2076
01:13:19,007 --> 01:13:20,106
Jong Hyuk.

2077
01:13:21,976 --> 01:13:24,976
(Why is Ji Hyo calling him urgently?)

2078
01:13:24,976 --> 01:13:26,576
You can write 1,000 Chinese characters here.

2079
01:13:26,576 --> 01:13:28,417
Be quiet.

2080
01:13:28,417 --> 01:13:29,917
(I feel like I'm getting smarter with all these books.)

2081
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:31,847
You can write 1,000 Chinese characters.

2082
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:33,457
Who needs that right now?

2083
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:34,616
What is wrong with her?

2084
01:13:35,387 --> 01:13:37,486
I think she's here to look around.

2085
01:13:37,486 --> 01:13:39,087
I'm not.

2086
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:40,797
I'm trying my best.

2087
01:13:41,156 --> 01:13:44,167
(He passes by the cameraman.)

2088
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:46,597
(Will he finally notice?)

2089
01:13:47,967 --> 01:13:49,167
(He passes by.)

2090
01:13:49,736 --> 01:13:54,076
(He passes by the cameraman and finds one on the cushion.)

2091
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:55,177
One.

2092
01:13:56,446 --> 01:13:58,877
(He found one.)

2093
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,177
- Where did you find this?
- I found one.

2094
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:03,087
You're really good at this.

2095
01:14:03,087 --> 01:14:05,616
- Of course. I have good vision.
- He's so good.

2096
01:14:05,847 --> 01:14:08,887
(Of course. I have good vision.)

2097
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:11,026
He's so good.

2098
01:14:11,526 --> 01:14:13,226
- This is ridiculous.
- This is so funny.

2099
01:14:13,226 --> 01:14:14,427
This is ridiculous.

2100
01:14:14,497 --> 01:14:16,427
I guess you didn't see that.

2101
01:14:16,896 --> 01:14:19,026
Didn't you see one on your way up?

2102
01:14:19,266 --> 01:14:20,797
You have 10 seconds left.

2103
01:14:20,797 --> 01:14:21,837
- 10 seconds?
- Yes.

2104
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:23,207
You have 10 seconds, Jong Hyuk.

2105
01:14:23,406 --> 01:14:25,866
- 10 seconds.
- 10, 9...

2106
01:14:25,866 --> 01:14:27,736
(How is this possible?)

2107
01:14:28,076 --> 01:14:29,377
- 6...
- 10 seconds?

2108
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:30,476
- 10 seconds.
- Hold on.

2109
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:31,547
- 4...
- This way.

2110
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:33,316
(He looks around the sofa next to the stairs.)

2111
01:14:33,316 --> 01:14:34,616
One. Done.

2112
01:14:35,047 --> 01:14:36,917
(He runs out of time right next to the stairs.)

2113
01:14:36,917 --> 01:14:39,047
(They fail the mission.)

2114
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:40,156
Goodness.

2115
01:14:40,516 --> 01:14:42,856
You have failed the mission.

2116
01:14:43,986 --> 01:14:45,726
(You're a rascal.)

2117
01:14:45,726 --> 01:14:47,497
- I mean...
- Where did you leave it?

2118
01:14:47,627 --> 01:14:48,927
You can't move it.

2119
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:50,326
(There's a name tag.)

2120
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:54,896
Hey.

2121
01:14:55,037 --> 01:14:58,207
Seok Jin is a genius.

2122
01:14:58,266 --> 01:15:00,837
- Hey, you know what I mean?
- I knew it.

2123
01:15:00,837 --> 01:15:02,307
- You finally see it.
- Do you have one?

2124
01:15:02,307 --> 01:15:03,906
Goodness. Hey.

2125
01:15:03,976 --> 01:15:06,476
How can I make it more obvious?

2126
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,177
It's over.

2127
01:15:08,177 --> 01:15:10,547
- This is driving me nuts.
- This is funny.

2128
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,316
- This is funny.
- This is ridiculous.

2129
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:13,787
It was on the stairs...

2130
01:15:13,957 --> 01:15:15,616
- on your way up.
- Really?

2131
01:15:16,757 --> 01:15:18,526
It was here in the beginning.

2132
01:15:19,026 --> 01:15:20,526
She has to lose to win.

2133
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:22,726
- That's why she wanted to go slow.
- She came up...

2134
01:15:23,026 --> 01:15:24,967
and sat on it. You said,

2135
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:27,797
"Why are you sitting here?" Then you went sideways.

2136
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:30,307
She wasn't looking for them.

2137
01:15:30,307 --> 01:15:32,107
(Thanks to Jong Hyuk, Ji Hyo wins 10 points.)

2138
01:15:32,337 --> 01:15:33,877
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook are at a bowling alley.)

2139
01:15:33,877 --> 01:15:37,377
I'll tell you the rules to Nice Bowling.

2140
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:40,446
You'll take turns to bowl.

2141
01:15:40,446 --> 01:15:43,516
If the total score is over 150, you win.

2142
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:45,516
This won't be easy.

2143
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:47,887
If you are successful, the guest takes the Korean beef gift set.

2144
01:15:47,887 --> 01:15:49,686
We have to win.

2145
01:15:49,787 --> 01:15:52,696
- We could've had 20 points by now.
- Right.

2146
01:15:52,696 --> 01:15:54,026
Can you tell me what this is about?

2147
01:15:54,026 --> 01:15:55,326
What's good?

2148
01:15:55,326 --> 01:15:57,196
You just have to bowl and go home.

2149
01:15:57,196 --> 01:15:59,337
If you try to do more than that,

2150
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:01,236
it'll make things awkward between us.

2151
01:16:01,297 --> 01:16:02,936
- I see.
- Sae Ho,

2152
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:04,337
you have your role.

2153
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:05,366
I know.

2154
01:16:05,366 --> 01:16:08,337
Honey, you're not in the best condition, so don't talk.

2155
01:16:08,337 --> 01:16:09,946
You should just bowl and go home.

2156
01:16:10,207 --> 01:16:11,476
When will I be in a better condition?

2157
01:16:11,476 --> 01:16:12,576
Never.

2158
01:16:12,576 --> 01:16:13,946
- When will I be better?
- I think...

2159
01:16:13,946 --> 01:16:15,847
- you're not being very funny.
- Really?

2160
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:17,247
- I'll try to bowl better.
- All right.

2161
01:16:17,247 --> 01:16:18,547
- You're in a very bad condition.
- Okay.

2162
01:16:18,547 --> 01:16:20,457
- Decide who will go first.
- Okay.

2163
01:16:20,486 --> 01:16:21,726
The person who's not as good...

2164
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,587
should go first.

2165
01:16:23,587 --> 01:16:25,757
- That's right.
- I'll go next.

2166
01:16:25,757 --> 01:16:27,226
You're not that good, so you can go first.

2167
01:16:27,226 --> 01:16:28,696
I'm bad at this.

2168
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:30,196
Relax.

2169
01:16:30,297 --> 01:16:31,696
Sae Ho.

2170
01:16:31,696 --> 01:16:32,766
I'll do what I normally do.

2171
01:16:32,766 --> 01:16:35,396
Look at the point in the middle. The big one.

2172
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:37,507
- Let's see.
- Let's watch you bowl first.

2173
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:38,967
- Let's watch and see.
- Let's go.

2174
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:40,807
I'm Bowling Cho.

2175
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:42,606
Bowling Cho.

2176
01:16:42,606 --> 01:16:44,347
Do it your style.

2177
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:48,076
(He throws a small bowling ball.)

2178
01:16:48,076 --> 01:16:51,717
(It goes in the gutter.)

2179
01:16:57,356 --> 01:17:00,057
(This isn't it.)

2180
01:17:00,057 --> 01:17:03,696
(I know it isn't.)

2181
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:05,627
Hold on.

2182
01:17:05,627 --> 01:17:07,097
- No.
- Attention.

2183
01:17:07,696 --> 01:17:10,467
(You're in a bad condition to bowl too.)

2184
01:17:10,467 --> 01:17:11,606
I told you.

2185
01:17:11,606 --> 01:17:13,783
- I already told you. I'm bad.
- I know, but I told you.

2186
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:16,146
- You can't be that bad.
- Come here, honey.

2187
01:17:16,146 --> 01:17:17,646
I told you I was bad.

2188
01:17:17,646 --> 01:17:20,016
- You should have told us.
- I did.

2189
01:17:20,116 --> 01:17:22,576
You said you were good at bowling.

2190
01:17:22,576 --> 01:17:23,887
I didn't say that.

2191
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:27,816
I just said Bowling Cho was my nickname.

2192
01:17:28,856 --> 01:17:30,627
- Why? Why is it Bowling Cho?
- How can you be so bad then?

2193
01:17:30,627 --> 01:17:33,997
I hope my life rolls on like a bowling ball, so I'm Bowling Cho.

2194
01:17:34,557 --> 01:17:36,396
You can't do this.

2195
01:17:36,696 --> 01:17:38,026
You can get a spare.

2196
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:41,097
- Does one person bowl twice?
- This is unbelievable.

2197
01:17:41,097 --> 01:17:42,807
Sae Ho, listen to me.

2198
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:44,366
- Honey, no.
- Hey.

2199
01:17:44,366 --> 01:17:45,436
- Hold on.
- Come on.

2200
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,677
- You can't do that.
- Your right arm touches your ear.

2201
01:17:47,677 --> 01:17:49,037
Sit down.

2202
01:17:49,037 --> 01:17:50,637
- Raise your arm to the ear.
- Let's go.

2203
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,677
Raise it up in a straight line.

2204
01:17:52,816 --> 01:17:54,446
Stop fooling around. Try your best.

2205
01:17:54,446 --> 01:17:55,816
- Raise it up in a straight line.
- I can get mad.

2206
01:17:55,816 --> 01:17:57,316
Straight line.

2207
01:17:57,316 --> 01:17:59,587
- All right. It was straight.
- What happened?

2208
01:17:59,587 --> 01:18:00,717
(He has a different facial expression now.)

2209
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,986
- All right. It was straight.
- What happened?

2210
01:18:03,186 --> 01:18:04,287
Good job.

2211
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,757
(He gets a spare.)

2212
01:18:08,257 --> 01:18:09,667
(He's triumphant.)

2213
01:18:10,597 --> 01:18:12,526
I told you. Straight line.

2214
01:18:12,597 --> 01:18:14,097
- Straight line.
- What happened?

2215
01:18:14,097 --> 01:18:16,137
- I don't know.
- It's okay.

2216
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:17,537
I just did it.

2217
01:18:17,606 --> 01:18:18,637
Good job.

2218
01:18:18,637 --> 01:18:19,707
You have to do it straight.

2219
01:18:19,707 --> 01:18:22,007
- What happened?
- I don't know either.

2220
01:18:22,007 --> 01:18:23,646
- Good job.
- I did it, right?

2221
01:18:23,747 --> 01:18:25,276
- How did you bowl?
- I don't know.

2222
01:18:25,276 --> 01:18:26,347
Hold on.

2223
01:18:26,917 --> 01:18:29,646
Did you want to lose, so you made him do this?

2224
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:31,387
What? Really?

2225
01:18:31,387 --> 01:18:33,156
How can you say that?

2226
01:18:33,616 --> 01:18:36,026
That's ridiculous. I have to win.

2227
01:18:36,026 --> 01:18:37,186
You can't do that.

2228
01:18:37,186 --> 01:18:38,356
- Of course not.
- We're in this together.

2229
01:18:38,356 --> 01:18:39,427
Of course.

2230
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:41,226
I haven't practiced. I'll start.

2231
01:18:41,226 --> 01:18:43,226
(Does he have to lose? Or is Jong Kook insisting?)

2232
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:44,627
Nice.

2233
01:18:44,627 --> 01:18:46,067
(Jong Kook bowls for the 2nd frame.)

2234
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:47,196
That wasn't good.

2235
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:49,807
(He gets 9 pins.)

2236
01:18:49,807 --> 01:18:51,236
- Nice!
- Nice!

2237
01:18:55,137 --> 01:18:56,877
(Nice.)

2238
01:18:58,476 --> 01:18:59,677
(I don't think Jae Seok finds it nice.)

2239
01:18:59,677 --> 01:19:01,446
- Are you sure?
- You're good.

2240
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:02,446
This is great.

2241
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:03,747
I can bowl like that too.

2242
01:19:03,747 --> 01:19:05,616
(Is that good? Or is Jae Seok acting?)

2243
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:07,917
(The ace member's 2nd turn)

2244
01:19:07,917 --> 01:19:09,826
It turned.

2245
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:12,997
(He misses a spare unfortunately.)

2246
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:14,457
(Laughing)

2247
01:19:14,457 --> 01:19:15,757
I flipped my wrist and...

2248
01:19:21,137 --> 01:19:22,196
Sae Ho.

2249
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,707
- Why were you so good?
- I don't know.

2250
01:19:24,707 --> 01:19:26,837
It wasn't you. I was laughing because of him.

2251
01:19:27,736 --> 01:19:30,076
- You laugh after a delay?
- Good job.

2252
01:19:30,946 --> 01:19:33,677
- All right. It's my turn.
- Good luck, Jae Seok.

2253
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:35,646
- Let's go.
- I almost had it.

2254
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:36,917
Then...

2255
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:38,347
does that mean I did better than you?

2256
01:19:38,347 --> 01:19:39,917
- Yes, for now.
- Right?

2257
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:40,986
Okay.

2258
01:19:40,986 --> 01:19:42,757
- I'll show you.
- All right.

2259
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,927
I don't know why I flipped my wrist.

2260
01:19:45,927 --> 01:19:47,427
I should have thrown it in a straight line.

2261
01:19:47,427 --> 01:19:48,907
(Jae Seok stands with a stable form.)

2262
01:19:49,526 --> 01:19:53,696
(I'll show you my bowling skills.)

2263
01:19:53,696 --> 01:19:55,037
Raise your arm straight up.

2264
01:19:55,766 --> 01:19:57,106
It's in the gutter.

2265
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,707
(The watermelon heads for the pit.)

2266
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:02,236
(Sighing)

2267
01:20:02,236 --> 01:20:04,877
I think he did that on purpose.

2268
01:20:05,976 --> 01:20:07,217
I can kind of tell.

2269
01:20:07,417 --> 01:20:08,476
No...

2270
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:10,847
- This is not easy.
- It's not.

2271
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,967
(Is this difficult for him? Or is he trying to lose?)

2272
01:20:13,616 --> 01:20:16,787
(Betting to win or lose)

2273
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:19,726
- We get 10 more points?
- Yes.

2274
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:21,026
(Jae Seok makes a decision to win 10 points.)

2275
01:20:21,026 --> 01:20:22,156
This is big.

2276
01:20:22,356 --> 01:20:23,596
We do this individually, right?

2277
01:20:25,896 --> 01:20:29,337
(Fail)

2278
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:31,566
This is really not easy.

2279
01:20:31,566 --> 01:20:33,766
(He has to do something to prevent getting 150 points.)

2280
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:35,476
Are you a weightlifter?

2281
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:37,476
Is this weightlifting?

2282
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:39,347
(Jong Kook doesn't like anything he does.)

2283
01:20:39,946 --> 01:20:41,016
I'll aim slightly to the right.

2284
01:20:41,016 --> 01:20:43,047
- Okay.
- Stand a little bit to the right.

2285
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,587
Look straight ahead.

2286
01:20:45,587 --> 01:20:47,347
Do what you normally do. Throw it naturally.

2287
01:20:47,587 --> 01:20:51,457
Be natural. Oh, gosh.

2288
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:55,226
(His ball takes a diagonal path.)

2289
01:20:55,497 --> 01:20:56,526
Oh, gosh.

2290
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,497
(Okay, that was natural.)

2291
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:04,707
(He's in trouble, but this is so funny.)

2292
01:21:05,037 --> 01:21:07,337
Come here. Come here.

2293
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:08,377
(Hey, you need to see me.)

2294
01:21:09,476 --> 01:21:10,677
- Come.
- I'll bowl better!

2295
01:21:11,847 --> 01:21:12,877
(He feels truly sorry.)

2296
01:21:12,877 --> 01:21:14,357
- I'll be better.
- This is nonsense.

2297
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:16,587
- This doesn't make sense.
- I'll bowl better!

2298
01:21:17,186 --> 01:21:18,646
That was so bad.

2299
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:21,156
I know. I have to win.

2300
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:23,287
You're unbelievable.

2301
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:25,356
I'll clean these.

2302
01:21:25,887 --> 01:21:28,656
- Sit down.
- Are you going to be this mad?

2303
01:21:28,726 --> 01:21:29,766
Sit down first.

2304
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:30,896
(Jong Kook throws him down.)

2305
01:21:30,896 --> 01:21:32,696
I could be bad at it.

2306
01:21:33,467 --> 01:21:34,766
You're not that bad.

2307
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:36,766
This is good, Bowling Cho.

2308
01:21:37,837 --> 01:21:40,177
(He gets 6 pins.)

2309
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:41,637
(He walks quietly.)

2310
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:45,606
Hold on.

2311
01:21:46,076 --> 01:21:47,377
Hold on.

2312
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,047
Is bowling supposed to be this scary?

2313
01:21:50,217 --> 01:21:51,646
He wants to lose for sure.

2314
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:52,656
(They finish 4 frames in a heavy atmosphere.)

2315
01:21:52,656 --> 01:21:54,516
I told you I don't.

2316
01:21:54,557 --> 01:21:56,357
(They finish 4 frames in a heavy atmosphere.)

2317
01:21:57,526 --> 01:21:58,627
Let's go.

2318
01:21:58,627 --> 01:22:01,067
(Jong Kook bowls for the 5th frame, and they have 37 points.)

2319
01:22:02,967 --> 01:22:04,097
It slipped.

2320
01:22:04,097 --> 01:22:06,366
(He's not doing as well as usual.)

2321
01:22:09,337 --> 01:22:10,366
(Glaring)

2322
01:22:10,366 --> 01:22:11,436
Why?

2323
01:22:12,307 --> 01:22:14,106
Why? What?

2324
01:22:15,377 --> 01:22:17,906
It's like he brought you when you didn't want to come.

2325
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:20,377
You have to get a spare.

2326
01:22:20,377 --> 01:22:21,377
(He's just saying that.)

2327
01:22:21,377 --> 01:22:23,287
- I'll do this. I'm doing this.
- Okay.

2328
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:24,847
Let's go. I'm getting a spare.

2329
01:22:25,146 --> 01:22:26,156
I'm doing it.

2330
01:22:26,156 --> 01:22:27,387
(I'll focus and do it the proper way.)

2331
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:28,387
Good one.

2332
01:22:28,856 --> 01:22:30,387
- He'll get it.
- It worked.

2333
01:22:32,557 --> 01:22:36,667
(Will he hit the remaining 4 pins and get a spare?)

2334
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:40,066
(He only got two.)

2335
01:22:40,066 --> 01:22:41,066
It turned left.

2336
01:22:41,497 --> 01:22:43,007
You are worse than me.

2337
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:46,507
(He's frank.)

2338
01:22:46,776 --> 01:22:48,707
See? He's not better than me.

2339
01:22:48,936 --> 01:22:50,507
Look at the score.

2340
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:51,906
- It slipped.
- Oh, gosh.

2341
01:22:51,906 --> 01:22:54,247
- How can you just hit those?
- It slipped.

2342
01:22:54,946 --> 01:22:56,686
Really? I think he's worse than me.

2343
01:22:56,686 --> 01:22:57,946
Nice.

2344
01:22:58,247 --> 01:22:59,587
- Nice?
- I'll be good. Nice.

2345
01:23:00,316 --> 01:23:01,957
- Nice.
- I'm going to be watching you.

2346
01:23:01,957 --> 01:23:04,026
I'm going to watch "Infinite Challenge" again.

2347
01:23:04,026 --> 01:23:05,087
(Jae Seok bowled in it.)

2348
01:23:05,526 --> 01:23:07,156
I'll see if you were this bad.

2349
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:09,797
- Don't say "Infinite Challenge".
- Why not?

2350
01:23:09,797 --> 01:23:11,467
- Don't mention it.
- I thought you bowled there.

2351
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:12,526
I did.

2352
01:23:12,526 --> 01:23:13,846
(That was short but a good time.)

2353
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:16,537
(Cleaning)

2354
01:23:16,537 --> 01:23:18,337
Why are you wiping it so much?

2355
01:23:18,807 --> 01:23:20,377
You're horrible anyway.

2356
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:22,037
- Give it to me.
- I can't wipe it?

2357
01:23:22,236 --> 01:23:23,776
- Give it.
- I'm not horrible.

2358
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,316
What are you doing? Just bowl.

2359
01:23:26,316 --> 01:23:27,717
(I'll get going first.)

2360
01:23:27,717 --> 01:23:30,287
Come here.

2361
01:23:30,287 --> 01:23:31,816
- Where are you going?
- I think I should leave.

2362
01:23:31,816 --> 01:23:32,856
Goodness.

2363
01:23:32,856 --> 01:23:35,287
Hurry up. Stop wiping it.

2364
01:23:35,287 --> 01:23:36,927
Stop yelling at me.

2365
01:23:38,486 --> 01:23:39,497
Oh, gosh.

2366
01:23:39,656 --> 01:23:41,557
This is stress... I mean...

2367
01:23:41,557 --> 01:23:42,837
- Strike?
- Let me get a strike.

2368
01:23:42,866 --> 01:23:44,497
You keep doubting me.

2369
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:46,266
- So do better.
- I will.

2370
01:23:46,266 --> 01:23:48,597
- Don't go for the gutter.
- Okay, I know.

2371
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:52,007
Raise your arm straight up.

2372
01:23:52,537 --> 01:23:54,007
Raise your arm up. Go.

2373
01:23:54,007 --> 01:23:55,576
(Jae Seok throws the ball with Jong Kook nagging him.)

2374
01:23:55,576 --> 01:23:56,677
Up.

2375
01:23:56,677 --> 01:23:57,747
- Good shot.
- Goodness.

2376
01:23:58,677 --> 01:23:59,776
That's not good.

2377
01:23:59,776 --> 01:24:01,377
His hand didn't go up to his head.

2378
01:24:02,717 --> 01:24:03,717
That's not good.

2379
01:24:03,717 --> 01:24:06,116
(Falling)

2380
01:24:07,957 --> 01:24:12,356
(Oh, what?)

2381
01:24:12,356 --> 01:24:14,297
Wasn't that good? I think that was good.

2382
01:24:14,297 --> 01:24:15,702
(He gets a high score unexpectedly.)

2383
01:24:15,726 --> 01:24:16,766
That was good, right?

2384
01:24:16,766 --> 01:24:17,826
Why are you not happy?

2385
01:24:17,826 --> 01:24:18,866
(You knocked over so many pins.)

2386
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:20,342
- Why are you not happy?
- What do you mean?

2387
01:24:20,366 --> 01:24:22,436
I have to get a spare. That's what I was planning.

2388
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:25,007
(He's suspicious.)

2389
01:24:25,467 --> 01:24:26,736
I'll get a spare.

2390
01:24:26,736 --> 01:24:27,807
(He only has 2 pins left.)

2391
01:24:27,807 --> 01:24:30,606
Push it forward. Eyes on the pins. Look far away.

2392
01:24:31,476 --> 01:24:34,616
Speak for yourself.

2393
01:24:34,847 --> 01:24:37,146
You look down here.

2394
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,847
- I don't look down.
- Goodness.

2395
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:41,057
Try it. Do what you did just now.

2396
01:24:41,217 --> 01:24:42,686
I'm trying.

2397
01:24:42,887 --> 01:24:44,826
- I'll do it.
- Go.

2398
01:24:44,826 --> 01:24:46,396
Come back. Where are you going?

2399
01:24:46,427 --> 01:24:47,497
Sit down.

2400
01:24:47,726 --> 01:24:48,896
Give me your jacket.

2401
01:24:49,226 --> 01:24:51,127
(He gets his jacket taken away.)

2402
01:24:52,766 --> 01:24:55,037
Is bowling supposed to be this uncomfortable?

2403
01:24:55,896 --> 01:24:58,807
- You're supposed to cheer.
- Right?

2404
01:24:58,866 --> 01:25:00,207
You keep nagging.

2405
01:25:00,207 --> 01:25:01,637
Just go.

2406
01:25:02,137 --> 01:25:04,047
Move back a little bit. Don't sit there.

2407
01:25:04,047 --> 01:25:05,747
I'm sitting on a chair.

2408
01:25:05,747 --> 01:25:07,047
It's fine.

2409
01:25:07,446 --> 01:25:08,677
(Jae Seok bowls for the 6th frame, 2nd shot.)

2410
01:25:08,677 --> 01:25:11,146
Throw it straight. Relax. Good job.

2411
01:25:11,146 --> 01:25:12,787
Oh, my.

2412
01:25:13,486 --> 01:25:14,486
Relax.

2413
01:25:14,486 --> 01:25:15,816
(Relax. Good job.)

2414
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:17,287
(Oh, my.)

2415
01:25:19,257 --> 01:25:20,257
Good luck.

2416
01:25:20,627 --> 01:25:21,997
(I should just clap.)

2417
01:25:22,967 --> 01:25:25,097
(The score is low like Jae Seok has planned.)

2418
01:25:25,266 --> 01:25:26,436
Okay!

2419
01:25:26,936 --> 01:25:29,167
(Sae Ho gets ready for the 7th frame.)

2420
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:30,537
(He throws it powerfully.)

2421
01:25:31,736 --> 01:25:33,507
Good job.

2422
01:25:36,007 --> 01:25:37,007
It keeps going into the gutter.

2423
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,047
(He won't turn around.)

2424
01:25:39,347 --> 01:25:40,747
(Thanks, Sae Ho.)

2425
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:41,987
It keeps going into the gutter.

2426
01:25:43,387 --> 01:25:47,316
(He's glaring at the back of Sae Ho's head.)

2427
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:49,826
(He never turns back.)

2428
01:25:50,856 --> 01:25:52,156
(He avoids looking back while grabbing a ball.)

2429
01:25:52,156 --> 01:25:53,656
Wipe the ball.

2430
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:55,726
Sae Ho, wipe it once.

2431
01:25:57,127 --> 01:25:58,726
Why are you sweating so much?

2432
01:25:59,637 --> 01:26:01,097
Why are you sweating so much?

2433
01:26:01,366 --> 01:26:04,007
(He's sweating instead of shedding tears.)

2434
01:26:05,637 --> 01:26:06,677
Don't flip your wrist.

2435
01:26:06,677 --> 01:26:09,377
(He's terrifying.)

2436
01:26:09,377 --> 01:26:10,707
(You scared me.)

2437
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:11,847
- Okay.
- Go straight up.

2438
01:26:11,847 --> 01:26:13,217
Don't tell me too many things.

2439
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:14,717
- I'll follow my instincts.
- Okay.

2440
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:15,847
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2441
01:26:17,686 --> 01:26:19,486
(This is Sae Ho's 7th frame, 2nd swing.)

2442
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:20,917
Nice.

2443
01:26:21,656 --> 01:26:22,686
Your wrist.

2444
01:26:23,326 --> 01:26:24,326
You punk!

2445
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:27,427
(What instinct?)

2446
01:26:29,497 --> 01:26:31,627
Why would you rotate your wrist outwards?

2447
01:26:31,627 --> 01:26:32,967
(I'm just wondering, )

2448
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,467
(but why am I getting scolded?)

2449
01:26:34,467 --> 01:26:36,366
I told you to do this.

2450
01:26:36,637 --> 01:26:39,007
(When did this start going wrong?)

2451
01:26:39,436 --> 01:26:41,637
Jong Kook, you look very angry.

2452
01:26:41,637 --> 01:26:42,646
Is it so hard to bring your arm up?

2453
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:43,677
- I know.
- You just have to raise it up.

2454
01:26:43,677 --> 01:26:45,007
I know the mission is important,

2455
01:26:45,276 --> 01:26:47,316
but you didn't even get a spare.

2456
01:26:47,316 --> 01:26:49,146
- Come back.
- Come back.

2457
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:50,347
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

2458
01:26:50,347 --> 01:26:52,316
Do you have a frozen shoulder? Can't you raise your arm?

2459
01:26:52,316 --> 01:26:53,387
(Sae Ho is about to cry.)

2460
01:26:53,656 --> 01:26:55,757
You don't have to have a frozen shoulder.

2461
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:58,627
Goodness. Let's not be greedy, Jong Kook.

2462
01:26:59,896 --> 01:27:01,356
Let's not be greedy.

2463
01:27:01,356 --> 01:27:03,167
(He lets go of his greed and shoots.)

2464
01:27:08,236 --> 01:27:09,436
Gosh!

2465
01:27:09,566 --> 01:27:10,866
I keep missing the center.

2466
01:27:11,137 --> 01:27:14,276
I would be fine if you were good and scolded me.

2467
01:27:14,476 --> 01:27:16,707
(Goodness)

2468
01:27:19,106 --> 01:27:20,377
(I spoke what was on my mind.)

2469
01:27:20,377 --> 01:27:21,877
Why did you do that?

2470
01:27:22,787 --> 01:27:24,217
Sorry, I have a headache.

2471
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:25,217
(What did I just do?)

2472
01:27:25,217 --> 01:27:26,257
(Was bowling this difficult emotionally?)

2473
01:27:26,257 --> 01:27:27,457
Still.

2474
01:27:28,587 --> 01:27:31,127
- Good luck.
- Okay, I'll get it.

2475
01:27:31,127 --> 01:27:32,557
- Spare.
- Watch.

2476
01:27:32,557 --> 01:27:34,277
(This is Jong Kook's 8th frame, 2nd swing.)

2477
01:27:39,097 --> 01:27:40,866
Okay. I got it.

2478
01:27:40,866 --> 01:27:42,497
(It's a clean shot.)

2479
01:27:44,307 --> 01:27:45,906
(Swinging)

2480
01:27:46,736 --> 01:27:48,037
(Okay. I got it.)

2481
01:27:48,707 --> 01:27:49,877
- Nice.
- I guess...

2482
01:27:49,877 --> 01:27:51,446
- you were really nervous.
- Why?

2483
01:27:51,446 --> 01:27:52,677
What was this?

2484
01:27:53,316 --> 01:27:55,016
(He swung his arm around because he wanted a spare.)

2485
01:27:55,016 --> 01:27:56,587
- Nice spin.
- Okay.

2486
01:27:56,717 --> 01:27:57,917
It's my turn.

2487
01:27:58,387 --> 01:28:00,387
(It's impossible to turn this game around.)

2488
01:28:01,787 --> 01:28:03,127
- Oh, gosh.
- He lost.

2489
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:05,087
(And for the remaining 2 frames, )

2490
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:07,356
(Jae Seok tried his best to lose.)

2491
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:09,696
Go.

2492
01:28:09,696 --> 01:28:10,826
(Sae Ho's final swing in the 10th frame)

2493
01:28:10,826 --> 01:28:12,866
You got it. Oh, gosh.

2494
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,467
(It ends up in the gutter.)

2495
01:28:14,467 --> 01:28:16,307
I told you 100 times that I am bad at bowling.

2496
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:19,507
I don't bowl much.

2497
01:28:21,606 --> 01:28:23,807
(They fail with the score of 76.)

2498
01:28:24,106 --> 01:28:26,417
Thus, you failed the mission.

2499
01:28:26,877 --> 01:28:29,347
That means Sae Ho won't get the beef gift set.

2500
01:28:29,347 --> 01:28:31,446
That's too bad.

2501
01:28:31,847 --> 01:28:33,156
- Also...
- Should I leave?

2502
01:28:34,257 --> 01:28:35,757
The two of you...

2503
01:28:35,757 --> 01:28:38,587
made a bet on whether the mission will be successful or not.

2504
01:28:39,557 --> 01:28:42,097
- Gosh.
- Firstly, Jong Kook wrote...

2505
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:43,896
"Success".

2506
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:46,073
- Unfortunately, Jae Seok wrote...
- You can tell us later.

2507
01:28:46,097 --> 01:28:48,366
- Look at me.
- "Failure".

2508
01:28:48,366 --> 01:28:50,537
(Unfortunately, Jae Seok wrote "Failure".)

2509
01:28:50,537 --> 01:28:52,066
Look at me. Hey.

2510
01:28:52,066 --> 01:28:53,736
Jae Seok obtains additional points.

2511
01:28:53,736 --> 01:28:56,847
Why did you reveal that right now? You could have revealed it later.

2512
01:28:56,946 --> 01:28:59,007
Jae Seok, sit down.

2513
01:28:59,446 --> 01:29:00,446
Sit down.

2514
01:29:00,616 --> 01:29:02,146
Take a seat.

2515
01:29:02,476 --> 01:29:03,787
It's easy...

2516
01:29:04,116 --> 01:29:05,646
to fail.

2517
01:29:05,646 --> 01:29:07,957
It's easy to fail. We can easily force it.

2518
01:29:08,016 --> 01:29:10,986
We can only succeed when we bring our hearts together.

2519
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:13,656
You failed on purpose.

2520
01:29:13,856 --> 01:29:16,497
Don't you think it's selfish?

2521
01:29:16,497 --> 01:29:18,073
- You are having an important talk.
- Let's be honest.

2522
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:19,436
- What do you think?
- I have to go.

2523
01:29:19,436 --> 01:29:20,837
- I have somewhere to be.
- Sae Ho.

2524
01:29:20,837 --> 01:29:21,837
Thank you for today.

2525
01:29:21,837 --> 01:29:23,366
- Sae Ho, go home.
- I will do that.

2526
01:29:23,366 --> 01:29:24,366
- You know, - Go on.

2527
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,707
- The two of you should talk it out.
- It's not like that.

2528
01:29:26,707 --> 01:29:29,137
Sit down. Sit down and listen to me.

2529
01:29:29,137 --> 01:29:30,377
- Come on.
- Sit here.

2530
01:29:30,377 --> 01:29:32,507
- No.
- Sit down.

2531
01:29:32,507 --> 01:29:33,616
Tell me what you think.

2532
01:29:33,747 --> 01:29:36,028
- It's not like that.
- You write "Success" or "Failure".

2533
01:29:36,146 --> 01:29:39,356
Between success and failure, which one is harder?

2534
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:40,387
The thing is,

2535
01:29:41,287 --> 01:29:42,516
I feel really uncomfortable.

2536
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,557
(I feel really uncomfortable.)

2537
01:29:44,757 --> 01:29:45,757
Tell me.

2538
01:29:45,757 --> 01:29:48,326
It was fun to see you and bowl with you.

2539
01:29:48,326 --> 01:29:50,927
- However...
- Tell me what you think.

2540
01:29:51,226 --> 01:29:53,066
I think I feel uncomfortable.

2541
01:29:53,637 --> 01:29:55,337
I can't believe Jae Seok.

2542
01:29:55,337 --> 01:29:57,667
I trust people too easily.

2543
01:29:58,366 --> 01:30:00,436
(What is he doing when the game is over?)

2544
01:30:01,736 --> 01:30:03,177
I trust people too much.

2545
01:30:03,177 --> 01:30:05,146
(He takes the correct form...)

2546
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:07,146
(and swings gently.)

2547
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:10,917
He did it.

2548
01:30:12,047 --> 01:30:14,757
(He took out the spares perfectly.)

2549
01:30:16,457 --> 01:30:17,457
He did it.

2550
01:30:19,156 --> 01:30:21,127
(Shocked)

2551
01:30:22,326 --> 01:30:24,927
(Jae Seok's bowling skills are unexpected.)

2552
01:30:26,066 --> 01:30:27,766
You are a swindler.

2553
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,707
- You know that?
- I am not a swindler.

2554
01:30:30,707 --> 01:30:31,987
(The real swindling begins now.)

2555
01:30:32,066 --> 01:30:33,076
(Next week)

2556
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:36,007
(The backstabbing race isn't over.)

2557
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:39,076
(Twists and turns of events)

2558
01:30:39,747 --> 01:30:41,877
(The grand finale finally unfolds.)

2559
01:30:42,316 --> 01:30:44,547
(Don't let your guard down for a second.)

2560
01:30:44,547 --> 01:30:47,557
(It's not over until it is.)

2561
01:30:47,557 --> 01:30:49,257
(What becomes of the TV rating notice?)

2562
01:30:49,257 --> 01:30:50,627
(And)

2563
01:30:51,127 --> 01:30:53,997
(So Min and Se Chan's One Year Anniversary Special)

2564
01:30:53,997 --> 01:30:56,026
(An outing organized just for them)

2565
01:30:56,026 --> 01:30:58,266
(Whatever Se Chan wishes for comes true.)

2566
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:00,436
(Of Se Chan, )

2567
01:31:00,436 --> 01:31:02,097
(by Se Chan, )

2568
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:03,736
(and for Se Chan.)

2569
01:31:04,266 --> 01:31:06,337
(They even get Twice as the special guest.)

2570
01:31:06,537 --> 01:31:09,106
(Se Chan's special day begins.)

2571
01:31:10,146 --> 01:31:11,606
Shazam!

2572
01:31:11,606 --> 01:31:14,247
(Se Chan's 1 Year Anniversary Special, One Day)
