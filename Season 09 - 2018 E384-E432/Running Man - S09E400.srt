1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:10,825
(Last week)

2
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:14,880
(The final race of the Family Package Project)

3
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,195
(It's You Take the Shuddering Package.)

4
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:19,850
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook became the team leaders.)

5
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:20,850
(Global, package, family)

6
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:22,520
(Hong Kong, land, and island)

7
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:24,135
Our destinations depend on our choices?

8
00:00:24,394 --> 00:00:29,205
(They met the team leaders through the door of the fate.)

9
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:31,960
(Ridiculous missions ensued.)

10
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:36,955
(They must complete the missions to avoid the penalty by today.)

11
00:00:37,674 --> 00:00:40,370
(This is so annoying! This should count as a penalty.)

12
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:41,970
(Team Jae Seok must stand in line whenever they see a queue.)

13
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:43,540
(Team Jong Kook must play yut with three brothers on Shinshimo Island.)

14
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:45,155
(Team Seok Jin must ride the longest zip line in Korea.)

15
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:47,065
(And today...)

16
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,010
(Avoid getting the Shuddering Package.)

17
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:53,635
(The war abroad, on land, and on an island unfolds.)

18
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,820
(Will it be a Luxury Package or a Shuddering Package?)

19
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:59,735
(Their 4 weeks' worth of effort will come to an end today.)

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,860
(It's the grand finale of the Family Package Project.)

21
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:08,315
(Which 6 members will depart for the Shuddering Tours?)

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,185
My gosh, I hate this.

23
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:12,600
It's fine as long as it's not me.

24
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:15,070
Then on our way there,

25
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,740
we should come up with a fair game.

26
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,540
Just to be clear, no one wants to ride it, right?

27
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:19,540
No.

28
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:22,880
We should get someone.

29
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:25,665
The one with the latest birthday will be chosen.

30
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:27,550
- I like that. - It's about the birthday.

31
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:28,750
- I'm game. - Are you?

32
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,035
We should switch.

33
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,435
- Later birthdays will win? - The latest birthday will win.

34
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:34,360
- The later birthdays are better? - The latest birthday will win.

35
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:36,800
- The highest number will win? - The higher, the better.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,460
We should just pick a group of four people.

37
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,000
- We should pick a group. - Okay.

38
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:41,445
(They will choose 2 members with the roulette.)

39
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:43,855
- My gosh, I'm nervous. - Time matters if it's the same day.

40
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:45,870
- Time will be a deciding factor. - Right, right.

41
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:51,340
(The earliest birthday gets 4 slots. The next 2 members get 1 slot each.)

42
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:53,380
My gosh, I'm really nervous. It's double.

43
00:01:53,383 --> 00:01:55,595
(I must win since four slots are at stake on this game.)

44
00:01:56,886 --> 00:02:03,460
(Whoever doesn't win has a higher chance in riding the zip line.)

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,590
Can you come here for a second?

46
00:02:06,596 --> 00:02:07,805
Please.

47
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:09,690
- Please come this way. - They are coming.

48
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,260
- Come this way, please. - This way, please.

49
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:12,330
We have four people here.

50
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:14,600
- Why don't you stand over here? - Come this way, please.

51
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:15,845
Please move along.

52
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,700
We have four people here. Okay.

53
00:02:17,707 --> 00:02:20,070
(4 employees who will determine Team Land's fate are invited.)

54
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,070
I choose him.

55
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,770
(He picks the youngest-looking cashier.)

56
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,425
Please come this way. You and I are partners.

57
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,380
I'll choose the chef.

58
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:28,810
My gosh, you chose the chef.

59
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:31,580
I pick Mr. Lee Jin Ho, the chief of the Product Department.

60
00:02:31,588 --> 00:02:34,435
I'll stand next to Im Young Min, the sales' chief.

61
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,520
We'll start from here.

62
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,005
- I'll go first? - Yes.

63
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,790
What's the date of your birthday?

64
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:44,830
(Sang Yeob chose the chef. When is his birthday?)

65
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,060
- Just the date. - It's on the 24th.

66
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:48,815
(It's on the 24th.)

67
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:51,100
(Sang Yeob is happy while Seok Jin is disappointed.)

68
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:52,315
I got goosebumps.

69
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,670
- Is today his lucky day? - My gosh, what's going on?

70
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:57,495
- What's up with him today? - He is...

71
00:02:57,947 --> 00:02:59,340
All right.

72
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,580
(Seok Jin changed the rules at the last minute.)

73
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,080
What's the date of your birthday?

74
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:04,880
(Did Seok Jin make the right move?)

75
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,835
- It's on the 31st. - My gosh!

76
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,750
It's on the 31st.

77
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:10,820
(Seok Jin's decision has brought upon a miracle.)

78
00:03:10,827 --> 00:03:12,735
- That's the highest it can get. - Yes!

79
00:03:12,896 --> 00:03:15,390
- It's the winning number. - It's the highest.

80
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:16,690
(I must avoid being last.)

81
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:17,730
- This is incredible. - My gosh.

82
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,760
I just got goosebumps. I got goosebumps.

83
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:22,215
I didn't think it would be the 31st.

84
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,415
I'm on the 19th.

85
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,500
- That's not bad. - That's not bad.

86
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:27,740
- Thank you. - My goodness.

87
00:03:27,744 --> 00:03:29,370
Will Haha place last?

88
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,655
(Haha's fate depends on the 19th.)

89
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:32,340
(Was he born later than the 19th?)

90
00:03:32,348 --> 00:03:35,125
- It's double. - Your name will be written twice.

91
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:37,495
Mr. Lee Jin Ho,

92
00:03:39,088 --> 00:03:40,535
what day of the month were you born?

93
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:44,020
(If it's earlier than the 19th, Haha loses.)

94
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:48,005
(If it's later than the 19th, Ji Hyo loses.)

95
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:49,560
It's on the 19th.

96
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,775
(My answer is 19th as well.)

97
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:53,870
- The number is the same. - 19th?

98
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,930
- What time were you born? - What time?

99
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:56,445
- Do you know? - The time of birth.

100
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,170
- 12:35am. - Yes!

101
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:01,885
(Yes!)

102
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,640
- If it's 12:35am... - It's bad, isn't it?

103
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:06,340
- The later the time, the better. - My goodness.

104
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,380
- The later the time, the better. - What time were you born?

105
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,820
(How about Haha's partner?)

106
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,095
- 11pm. - Yes!

107
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,890
- I am not last. - 11pm.

108
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:18,220
(Thanks to his partner, Haha doesn't finish last.)

109
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,035
- Ji Hyo. - Thank goodness.

110
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,690
(I can't believe I will get 4 slots.)

111
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,430
Ji Hyo will get the most number of slots.

112
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,760
Thank you so much for being born at 11pm.

113
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,170
Seriously.

114
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,030
(Ji Hyo gets 4 slots. Haha and Sang Yeob get 1 slot each.)

115
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:30,740
I keep going to the restroom.

116
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,200
(Haha gets 3 slots, Seok Jin gets 2 slots, and Ji Hyo gets 1 slot.)

117
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,270
- I became sensitive. - Already?

118
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:35,655
How many slots does Haha have?

119
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:38,010
- He has three slots, right? - Haha has...

120
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:39,455
- 3 slots. - 3 slots.

121
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,680
(It can't be like this.)

122
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,125
3 slots. I have 3 slots, too.

123
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,465
Sang Yeob, what is your opinion on variety shows?

124
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:47,850
(Why is he suddenly asking about his opinion on variety shows?)

125
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:49,720
- What do you mean? - What is your opinion on them?

126
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:53,320
A variety show has different characters.

127
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,490
That's right.

128
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,905
I recommend that you become a character who says,

129
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,630
- "I will do it." - That's right.

130
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,060
I was going to say the same thing.

131
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:02,430
You are a veteran. Let me tell you.

132
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,515
You should be Yes Man.

133
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:05,870
(Yes Man?)

134
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,585
- Yes Man? - You will be rich and popular.

135
00:05:08,778 --> 00:05:10,010
You will land a pizza commercial.

136
00:05:10,013 --> 00:05:11,140
"We don't have anyone to deliver pizza."

137
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,540
(Take the bait.)

138
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:15,280
- "What should I do?" - "I will deliver it!"

139
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:16,580
(Here comes Yes Man.)

140
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:19,480
(He takes the bait.)

141
00:05:19,489 --> 00:05:20,750
All right. I will write my name down.

142
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,065
(He is naive.)

143
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:25,005
Let's light up the fireworks!

144
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:27,590
- My goodness. - I will do it.

145
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:30,400
(The innocent sheep wants to have a unique character.)

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,460
Yes Man did it.

147
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:32,930
Yes Man!

148
00:05:32,936 --> 00:05:34,945
(Yes Man fills the remaining slots with his name.)

149
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:40,440
(Sang Yeob, congratulations on your new character...)

150
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:43,585
(and the higher probability of riding the zip line.)

151
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,080
(The festive car runs on the highway.)

152
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,010
It's a good day to go on the zip line.

153
00:05:49,018 --> 00:05:50,535
(They arrive at the zip line spot in Hadong.)

154
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:55,235
- I suddenly feel carsick. - Hold on. I feel nauseous.

155
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,935
It's okay. I can do this.

156
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:00,035
Only the people who are chosen will ride the zip line.

157
00:06:00,496 --> 00:06:02,560
Oxygen is scarce up here. I am serious.

158
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,545
I bet oxygen is scarce up here.

159
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes Man, I love you.

160
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:09,100
(Please do this for us.)

161
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:10,855
Yes Man went home.

162
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:14,425
- Yes Man clocked out. - Yes Man clocked out.

163
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:18,210
We are here. This is it.

164
00:06:18,214 --> 00:06:19,540
This is ridiculous.

165
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:20,680
(Is this the zip line? This is ridiculous.)

166
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:21,925
This is ridiculous.

167
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:25,850
(Is this your first time at this kind of a zip line?)

168
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:27,305
I feel like I am going to puke.

169
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,835
This is crazy.

170
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,420
Let's stop this.

171
00:06:31,427 --> 00:06:33,235
We can't go down this slope.

172
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:35,305
How will we go down?

173
00:06:35,398 --> 00:06:37,230
One. Let's go.

174
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:41,000
(An actual video of the ride)

175
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:45,985
(The land is nowhere in sight.)

176
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:50,610
(After traveling down 732m on a steep slope,)

177
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:53,895
(you go down another 1,487m.)

178
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,180
(The adventure ends after you travel 967m over the archipelago.)

179
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,080
- The slope is... - Look at this.

180
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:01,020
Look at the slope of the zip line.

181
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:02,865
This is ridiculous.

182
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,220
- This is too much. - This is crazy.

183
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:07,275
This is ridiculous.

184
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,875
- This is... - Does it go down to there?

185
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,245
- It seems so. - It's so far way.

186
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:16,030
(Haha heads to the restroom.)

187
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,000
(Retching)

188
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:21,255
(He retches in extreme nervousness.)

189
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:26,795
(I remember Se Chan did this for the Nevis Swing.)

190
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:33,495
(It's time to choose 2 people who will ride the zip line.)

191
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:37,090
We have to spin the wheel.

192
00:07:37,093 --> 00:07:39,320
Let's ask the director to spin the wheel.

193
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:41,775
- There will be no practice rounds. - Okay.

194
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:43,930
There will be no take backs or practice rounds?

195
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,430
There will be no practice rounds. Don't make excuses.

196
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:48,230
Please spin the wheel. Who will ride the zip line first?

197
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,445
Get your fingers off the wheel.

198
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,900
(Ji Hyo has 7 slots, Haha has 3 slots,)

199
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:54,185
(Seok Jin has 3 slots, and Sang Yeob has 3 slots.)

200
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:55,570
Who will it be?

201
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:57,825
(Which member is fated to ride the zip line first?)

202
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:00,340
(Meanwhile, Team Island)

203
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,780
- We arrived at the island. - Okay.

204
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,050
(They arrive at Shinshimo Island, the three brothers' island.)

205
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:05,395
This is Shin Island.

206
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,050
You are right.

207
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:09,135
- Is this Shin Island? - Shin Island.

208
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:11,705
This is Shin Island, not Shi Island or Mo Island.

209
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,130
Before you get started with the mission,

210
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,975
I will share additional rules regarding the Running Balls.

211
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:19,760
Depending on the outcome of the mission,

212
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,800
the team will get either 4 or 40 Running Balls.

213
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:23,645
The distribution of these Running Balls...

214
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:25,815
will be decided by the team members' votes.

215
00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:29,870
If every member gets one vote, they will be distributed evenly.

216
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,140
If one member gets more votes than the others,

217
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,265
he or she will receive all of them.

218
00:08:34,717 --> 00:08:35,910
However,

219
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:38,495
if a member is voted unanimously,

220
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:41,650
the member he or she chooses...

221
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,765
will receive all the Running Balls.

222
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,520
Please cast your votes carefully.

223
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:48,290
- This is the war of nerves. - We will have to play smart.

224
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:50,190
If you receive 40 Running Balls, you will get a Shuddering Sticker.

225
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:53,300
The producer is carrying a ballot box.

226
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:54,630
It's the moving ballot box.

227
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,945
You can change your decision, right?

228
00:08:56,973 --> 00:08:59,500
You can revise your ballots until the end of the mission.

229
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,370
(You can revise your ballots until the end of the mission.)

230
00:09:01,377 --> 00:09:02,770
Should I write down Kwang Soo's name ahead of time?

231
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,710
(Should I write down Kwang Soo's name ahead of time?)

232
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:06,025
My name?

233
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:08,780
Let's base our decisions on how we do on the mission.

234
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,010
Don't make up your mind from the start.

235
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,120
I didn't make up my mind.

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,695
- Okay. - Also,

237
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:16,165
if all of us write our own names, we will have a happy ending.

238
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:17,820
- Our own names? - Our own names?

239
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:19,805
Then the Running Balls will be divided evenly.

240
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,890
- Let's write our own names. - Let's do that.

241
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:23,960
- Let's do that. - Kwang Soo won't write his name.

242
00:09:23,966 --> 00:09:26,700
- I will. - He can't be trusted.

243
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:28,330
Let's write our own names.

244
00:09:28,337 --> 00:09:30,755
- Let's do it now. - Will you change it?

245
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:32,200
Tell me before you do that.

246
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,425
It has begun.

247
00:09:34,677 --> 00:09:37,155
(Tell me before you do that.)

248
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:40,140
That's great. Da Hee, you are doing great.

249
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,080
Pressure him. I like it when you do that.

250
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,450
You became annoyed so early on today.

251
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,795
- I am sorry. - He is an utter jerk.

252
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:50,720
- Write it on the left corner. - Oh, here?

253
00:09:50,726 --> 00:09:51,820
The voter.

254
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:53,335
- Write down the name of the voter. - Okay.

255
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:56,875
- Did you write it down already? - Yes.

256
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:58,830
Did you make your vote?

257
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,930
- Yes. - Already?

258
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:02,930
- Oh, you want me to do it now. - No, write down your name.

259
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,240
(The producer is flustered.)

260
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,985
Write down the name of the voter.

261
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,185
You should pull her aside and explain the rules.

262
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,840
- I mean... - What is wrong with her?

263
00:10:11,848 --> 00:10:14,280
He said I could change my decision later.

264
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,725
- Did you write down a name? - Yes.

265
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,395
What?

266
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,550
Why did you write my name? Write your own.

267
00:10:21,557 --> 00:10:23,065
I wrote my own name right here.

268
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:25,305
Then why did you write my name and cross it out?

269
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:27,090
(My goodness.)

270
00:10:27,096 --> 00:10:28,960
- Write your own name. - She voted.

271
00:10:28,965 --> 00:10:30,430
- Write yours. - She's done.

272
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,360
She made a decision in her mind.

273
00:10:32,368 --> 00:10:34,530
- She already voted. - Did you vote already?

274
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,630
- Yes, she did. - Gosh, my nose is runny.

275
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,900
Don't get mad at her for her vote.

276
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:41,070
It's time to find the three brothers.

277
00:10:41,077 --> 00:10:43,270
Please ask around to find them.

278
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,380
- Okay. - Okay.

279
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,710
Let's finish the mission quickly.

280
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,765
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

281
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:49,480
(Team Island bickers from the start.)

282
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,580
- It's nice. - I feel like I am on a picnic.

283
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:52,895
I know.

284
00:10:53,756 --> 00:10:55,865
Da Hee, I am going to get a Luxury Sticker.

285
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:59,835
You should get a Shuddering Sticker at least once.

286
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,490
Jong Kook has a Shuddering Sticker.

287
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:05,560
(Jong Kook has a Shuddering Sticker.)

288
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:09,400
Don't you care more about being with Jong Kook?

289
00:11:09,405 --> 00:11:11,515
He will go on the Luxury Package.

290
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:13,785
Who? Me?

291
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:15,140
- Luxury Package? - Trust me.

292
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,385
He has a Shuddering Sticker.

293
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:18,740
- Trust me, Jong Kook. - Okay.

294
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:19,840
How about you?

295
00:11:19,849 --> 00:11:23,765
Between Luxury Package and Jin Young, what would you choose?

296
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,350
This is what Jong Kook is like.

297
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:26,880
If Jin Young really wants it, he will go with her.

298
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,820
- Of course. - Well...

299
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,820
- I am not desperate about a man. - No?

300
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:33,990
(I am not desperate about a man.)

301
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:36,505
That's why you should be desperate, okay?

302
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,600
(That's why you should be desperate, okay?)

303
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:42,130
Why are you asking him to be desperate?

304
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,470
(Jin Young tries to tame a tiger.)

305
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:47,510
When a woman isn't desperate, I ask her to leave.

306
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,770
- I am like that. - I am like that, too.

307
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,855
I think Jin Young likes him,

308
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,280
but it's not enough to go on the Shuddering Package.

309
00:11:55,284 --> 00:11:56,725
Really?

310
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,580
That's what I gathered.

311
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:01,090
If she gets a chance to go on the Luxury Package,

312
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,565
she will go.

313
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:05,890
When I was on Running Man last time...

314
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,730
- Was it Kwang Soo who said it? - What?

315
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,230
Someone said that I called Jong Kook in a drunken state...

316
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:11,630
only to have him screen my call.

317
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,730
Someone said that.

318
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:16,530
- I keep seeing in the comments. - What?

319
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,685
"Even though Jong Kook rejected her, she keeps making advances."

320
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,400
Really?

321
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,770
- Firstly... - Say it. Say it.

322
00:12:21,777 --> 00:12:23,310
Have I ever called you in a drunken state?

323
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:25,055
I have never done that.

324
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:30,210
(Say that I have never called you in a drunken state.)

325
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:32,150
I think you did call me.

326
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,580
(I don't know about drinking though.)

327
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:34,820
- What? - At night.

328
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:36,365
I did call you but...

329
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,490
- I don't know if you were drunk. - Stop it.

330
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:40,690
- I mean... - Stop it.

331
00:12:40,696 --> 00:12:42,505
- Stop it. - I don't know if you were drunk.

332
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,245
(She hits him in embarrassment.)

333
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,260
- My goodness. - What is that?

334
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:49,115
There is a township office.

335
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,785
- Look. - You are right.

336
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:53,540
- There are a lot of buildings. - I know.

337
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:55,585
- Let's go. - There is...

338
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,710
- a township office. - That's right. Let's get off.

339
00:12:57,713 --> 00:12:59,640
- We should ask here. - I see a sign.

340
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:00,995
We should ask here.

341
00:13:01,217 --> 00:13:03,210
We don't have a clue right now.

342
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:06,750
We will get useful information at the township office.

343
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:08,250
- Are we allowed to do this? - Can we...

344
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,350
- Can we ask at the township office? - Are we allowed to do this?

345
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,120
We don't have a clue on how to find the three brothers.

346
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:13,320
It's game over.

347
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:15,890
- We will get our answer right away. - Then it's a matter of going there.

348
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,875
Can the production crew go in?

349
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,430
Can they?

350
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:22,615
- Hello. - Hello.

351
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,070
- Hello. - Hello.

352
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,870
Is it okay if we shoot here?

353
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:31,325
- I'm not sure. - We weren't sure about that either.

354
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:33,780
- I was wondering... - Just do it.

355
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,310
Okay, thank you.

356
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:36,810
- Thank you. - Thank you.

357
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,880
- Thank you for being kind. - He has a good personality.

358
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:42,835
We were wondering if there's a family of...

359
00:13:43,392 --> 00:13:46,120
three brothers living in this region.

360
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,930
- Three brothers? - Pardon?

361
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,160
(Are there three brothers in this region?)

362
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,960
That's not common.

363
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,400
- It's not common. - Why?

364
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,930
- It's not common, right? - It's because...

365
00:13:55,938 --> 00:13:57,955
in this region,

366
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:01,370
there aren't many people who work around here.

367
00:14:01,377 --> 00:14:03,870
- Don't they move out? - They work elsewhere.

368
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,910
- Right, that's what I said. - There aren't many people...

369
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,980
- who work here. - Right.

370
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:09,980
Are there any elderly people...

371
00:14:09,985 --> 00:14:13,180
who live with their brothers?

372
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:16,050
- Are there anyone like that? - No.

373
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:18,390
It's okay if they make baby noises.

374
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:19,720
- They can be infants. - Right.

375
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,160
How about this?

376
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:23,190
I was there during lunch.

377
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,130
It's for planting rice seedlings.

378
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:27,715
- Some people are planting them. - Right now?

379
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,400
- It's a group of 20 people. - Really?

380
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:31,500
Is it nearby?

381
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:33,815
It takes 20 to 30 minutes by car.

382
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,670
- We should go there. - I see.

383
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:36,925
Thank you so much.

384
00:14:38,147 --> 00:14:39,825
- Will we go where they're planting? - Let's go.

385
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,110
- Will there be people? - I think so.

386
00:14:42,118 --> 00:14:45,980
The colors in this neighborhood are pretty.

387
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:47,790
- You're right. - It's so colorful here.

388
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,990
- It's because it's sunny. - It's because of the good weather.

389
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,290
Isn't the bus stop nice too?

390
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:55,560
This would make a great background for photos.

391
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:57,660
- Shall we take a photo? - What?

392
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,575
Look over here.

393
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:01,915
1, 2.

394
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:04,800
(On a warm, spring day,)

395
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:06,185
(they make a souvenir.)

396
00:15:07,476 --> 00:15:08,470
It's done.

397
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:10,325
Shall we take one while looking at the sky?

398
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,740
Let's look at the sky.

399
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,540
- She seems so excited. - Let's do that.

400
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,595
- Look directly at the sky? - Yes.

401
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:19,295
(Just stare aimlessly at the sky.)

402
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:22,950
- How about we do this? - Can we please stop?

403
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,420
Let's pose like models.

404
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:26,035
- Andre Kim's trademark pose? - Yes.

405
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,660
- Okay. - Like Andre Kim?

406
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:29,390
- In 3, 2, 1. - 3, 2.

407
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,645
(Are you really making that pose?)

408
00:15:31,233 --> 00:15:35,030
(What else can I do?)

409
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:37,585
(She successfully trains Jong Kook.)

410
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,070
(Is this a wedding photoshoot?)

411
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:41,440
What are they doing?

412
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:42,685
(Laughing)

413
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:44,610
- Do it, Kwang Soo. - Do what?

414
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,440
Take a photo in this pose.

415
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,925
Why should I?

416
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,795
(They put their heads together.)

417
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,080
(They look like enemies.)

418
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,905
(Let's smile, Kwang Soo.)

419
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:56,935
Let's go now.

420
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:58,520
- Let's go. - We don't have time.

421
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:00,520
- Let's go. - We don't have time for this.

422
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:01,790
(They move while blaming the lack of time.)

423
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,575
It must be here.

424
00:16:04,033 --> 00:16:05,560
- All of them are here. - Where?

425
00:16:05,568 --> 00:16:07,570
It's a sight I've only seen in dramas.

426
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,530
We'll definitely get information from them.

427
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,400
- Hello. - Hello.

428
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:13,185
Hello.

429
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,870
Hello, sir. You're working hard.

430
00:16:15,878 --> 00:16:18,040
- They'll like her. - He likes Jin Young.

431
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,440
They'll like Jin Young.

432
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:23,295
Keep showing your teeth. You must show your teeth.

433
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:25,880
- Hello. - Hello.

434
00:16:25,888 --> 00:16:27,750
- Hello. - Hello, ma'am.

435
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:30,065
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

436
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,090
- You're working hard. - Hello.

437
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:35,190
- Hello. - You're working so hard.

438
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:36,760
We'd like to ask a question.

439
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,675
We should give this to each of them.

440
00:16:39,835 --> 00:16:42,245
- You're the best. - I agree.

441
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:43,970
Hello, ma'am.

442
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,800
- Have one each. - Please drink this.

443
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,100
(She's very cute and polite.)

444
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,755
- Please drink it. - That's right.

445
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:50,925
- Have a drink. - Thank you.

446
00:16:51,146 --> 00:16:54,025
Please have a drink. Hello.

447
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,810
Why didn't you come with Song Ji Hyo?

448
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,595
Ji Hyo went somewhere else.

449
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:00,480
He's her biggest fan.

450
00:17:00,489 --> 00:17:02,250
Do you like Ji Hyo?

451
00:17:02,258 --> 00:17:04,420
When you appeared on "Law of the Jungle",

452
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:05,620
I saw you many times.

453
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:07,630
Do you mean me? Thank you.

454
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,160
I saw you running in bushes.

455
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,475
- You're number one. - Thank you.

456
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:15,600
The work must be difficult.

457
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,985
- Don't let others be mean to you. - I'll work harder.

458
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,540
Are there any families of three brothers...

459
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:26,310
- in this neighborhood? - Three brothers?

460
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,595
Is there a family of three brothers in this neighborhood?

461
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,880
(He has one.)

462
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,080
You too.

463
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:34,180
- Wait. - Do you have two brothers?

464
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:36,850
The three brothers must live here.

465
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,520
Do they live near here?

466
00:17:38,527 --> 00:17:41,590
- No, they aren't here. - You must cross the sea.

467
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:44,260
We should have made three brothers.

468
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:46,730
- Three brothers? - That's not your fault.

469
00:17:46,735 --> 00:17:48,830
Not making three brothers isn't your fault.

470
00:17:48,837 --> 00:17:50,330
We're just asking.

471
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:52,970
I'd make three sons if you had called ahead.

472
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:54,755
In that short period of time?

473
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:57,070
How long in advance should we have called?

474
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,040
How could you make three sons in the meantime?

475
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:01,925
I'd have one more child if you had called yesterday.

476
00:18:02,318 --> 00:18:03,750
Yesterday?

477
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:05,180
(No way.)

478
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,850
Is it possible in a day?

479
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:08,020
(His eyes quaver.)

480
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,820
Medical practice is advanced these days.

481
00:18:09,825 --> 00:18:11,805
(He speaks without changing expressions.)

482
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:14,930
Pardon me? Is it true?

483
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,245
- No way. - You seem so naive.

484
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:19,875
- Go and see. - Okay, thank you.

485
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,500
There's a family of three children.

486
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:26,100
They're somewhere. They have three children.

487
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:28,110
- Listen, Jong Kook. - Hello.

488
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,540
- Let's shake hands. - Hello, sir.

489
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:30,710
(They get acquainted.)

490
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:31,740
Is there a family of three...

491
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,825
Why do you only like black?

492
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:37,225
How did you know that?

493
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:40,150
- Black? - You should also like white.

494
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:43,765
Black doesn't get dirty easily. Thank you for noticing.

495
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,835
Instead of getting married, you want others to have children.

496
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm sorry, sir.

497
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:50,405
I promise to have three children, sir.

498
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:52,460
- You'd better keep your promise. - I will.

499
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:53,730
I'll have three children.

500
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:56,430
Your mother expected so much from you on "Mom's Diary".

501
00:18:56,438 --> 00:18:58,155
You're right.

502
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,740
This is how I get scolded.

503
00:19:00,743 --> 00:19:03,810
I'm impressed that all of them know all this.

504
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:06,310
- They know everything about here. - They all know.

505
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:08,180
- Thank you so much. - Thank you so much.

506
00:19:08,183 --> 00:19:09,780
- Thank you. - Thank you.

507
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:11,220
- Good luck on your work. - Thank you.

508
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,580
- We haven't seen it in a long time. - Goodbye.

509
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:16,805
- Good luck. - Thank you, goodbye.

510
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:18,935
I think...

511
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:21,460
- it'll get more difficult. - It's getting harder.

512
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:23,945
It makes me concentrate on the voting.

513
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:26,245
What are you talking about?

514
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,730
- Look how pretty it is. - What is?

515
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:32,300
When would we walk on a street like this again? Look at this.

516
00:19:32,307 --> 00:19:34,440
- The yellow paint is coming off. - You're right.

517
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:37,470
- There's a house here. - Hello, sir.

518
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,610
- Hello. - Hello.

519
00:19:39,615 --> 00:19:41,310
May we ask you a question?

520
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,110
- We're from Running Man on Sunday. - Hello.

521
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,180
Hello.

522
00:19:45,187 --> 00:19:49,120
On this island, is there a family of three brothers?

523
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,890
Is there a family of three brothers?

524
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,520
- Three brothers? - Yes.

525
00:19:52,528 --> 00:19:54,305
- Who are living together? - Yes.

526
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,705
I have a family of three brothers.

527
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,475
My older brother lives in Uijeongbu.

528
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:02,700
- He moved away. - Really?

529
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:04,500
- Jong Kook, talk to them. - For now...

530
00:20:04,506 --> 00:20:06,500
- Listen. - This is great.

531
00:20:06,508 --> 00:20:08,540
We searched very hard,

532
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,610
- but we couldn't find any. - Listen, sir.

533
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:11,940
- Please, sir. - Listen.

534
00:20:11,947 --> 00:20:14,310
Let's make a deal.

535
00:20:14,316 --> 00:20:16,965
- He has a family of three brothers. - Right.

536
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:19,080
Instead of meeting his older brother,

537
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,020
can we meet another member of his family?

538
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,750
I have a daughter-in-law.

539
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,520
- Okay. - That sounds good.

540
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:27,320
Will you substitute his brother with his daughter-in-law?

541
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:28,560
Yes, is it possible?

542
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:30,430
- We can't clear this mission. - He's right.

543
00:20:30,432 --> 00:20:32,560
It was supposed to be three brothers.

544
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,685
As a penalty,

545
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:38,340
if you accept 10 Running Balls, we'll let you continue.

546
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,500
- 10? - 10?

547
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:41,270
- Accept 10 balls? - Yes.

548
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:43,685
Will you accept 10 Running Balls and continue?

549
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,940
- Will you accept 10? - Let's do it.

550
00:20:45,948 --> 00:20:47,380
- Let's do it. - His brothers aren't here.

551
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:48,780
- It's hard to find. - Right.

552
00:20:48,784 --> 00:20:50,410
- Okay. - They said there aren't any.

553
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,450
- They don't live here. - Accept 10 as a penalty.

554
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:54,080
- In 3, 2, 1. - 2, 1.

555
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:55,335
- Start. - Start.

556
00:20:55,524 --> 00:20:57,035
Let's play a game.

557
00:20:57,326 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm disappointed.

558
00:20:58,527 --> 00:21:00,520
(Will they finish the next mission safely?)

559
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:01,590
Let's go in.

560
00:21:01,597 --> 00:21:03,205
- Hello. - Hello.

561
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,175
- Hello. - Hello.

562
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:08,615
These are three brothers of the family.

563
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:11,670
It's the daughter-in-law instead of the eldest brother.

564
00:21:11,673 --> 00:21:14,285
- That's right. - She'll join the game.

565
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:17,510
So we're here to play yut.

566
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,340
- Do you play it often... - Yes.

567
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:21,040
- during the holidays? - You won't defeat us.

568
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:22,325
Really?

569
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,410
I see.

570
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,795
- Some people have old talents. - Right.

571
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:28,605
We have...

572
00:21:28,757 --> 00:21:31,165
- What is it? - Do you have the game board?

573
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,005
- We need to spread it out. - Of course.

574
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:36,190
- You must play it often. - Right.

575
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:38,975
- Is it already prepared? - He has it prepared at home.

576
00:21:39,568 --> 00:21:41,645
We need one more layer to see better.

577
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,930
Spread it out. You lose your turn...

578
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,800
- if one stick goes out. - You're right, sir.

579
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:47,985
That should be hard to do.

580
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,025
- That will be hard. - It'll be unless you throw it hard.

581
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:54,040
All right, let's win in one go.

582
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,880
That sounds good.

583
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:59,080
I thought you were only good at sports. Are you good at yut?

584
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,350
Me? I don't know if I'm that good.

585
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,565
We need to tie up a string.

586
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,320
(We need to tie up a string to play it properly.)

587
00:22:06,328 --> 00:22:07,890
- A string? - A string?

588
00:22:07,896 --> 00:22:10,475
- A string? - Why do we need a string?

589
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,460
It's to measure the height.

590
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,375
(I'm a professional.)

591
00:22:14,603 --> 00:22:17,215
- We don't need to. - He's right.

592
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:20,500
- The height should be measured. - I didn't know that.

593
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:23,085
He's a professional yut player on the national team.

594
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:26,655
You must throw 1.5m high.

595
00:22:26,682 --> 00:22:29,095
- Do we tie up a string? - One of the sticks...

596
00:22:29,284 --> 00:22:31,750
must be higher than the string.

597
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:32,780
(It's a special method.)

598
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,990
Did he just make up that rule?

599
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,035
- It's an original rule. - Really?

600
00:22:38,226 --> 00:22:40,135
- Look at that. - Here it is.

601
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:42,590
- Here it is. - What is it?

602
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,600
Are you tying up a string like that?

603
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,160
He's setting them up for the string.

604
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:48,600
(He sets it up naturally.)

605
00:22:48,604 --> 00:22:50,545
- Sir. - Wait, sir.

606
00:22:50,973 --> 00:22:52,270
Why...

607
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:53,500
(He does it with bare hands.)

608
00:22:53,508 --> 00:22:55,270
- Sir. - Wait, sir.

609
00:22:55,277 --> 00:22:56,470
- Yes? - Why...

610
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,855
It doesn't work well.

611
00:22:57,879 --> 00:22:59,980
- Sir. - Help him.

612
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,750
- That's right. - What's going on?

613
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,725
This is impressive.

614
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,895
- She brought a hammer. - Where did you find it?

615
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:09,450
The game became more serious.

616
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,505
- What's this? - I've never played it like this.

617
00:23:12,628 --> 00:23:14,905
We should invite a professional judge.

618
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,730
Sir, isn't this too high?

619
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,200
- Shall we lower it? - No, no.

620
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
- It's high enough to hang laundry. - They're very determined.

621
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:24,215
- They seem determined to win. - We're...

622
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,415
We're not that serious about this.

623
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:30,370
- Look at that. - They have that.

624
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:32,055
- What's that? - Let me fix it.

625
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,325
Sir, what do you do for a living?

626
00:23:34,816 --> 00:23:36,025
Sir.

627
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:38,795
What is going on here?

628
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,250
- It's a broken hoe. - It's a hoe?

629
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:44,305
- We could fix the rope with that. - It's broken.

630
00:23:44,626 --> 00:23:46,420
This is fun.

631
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:48,030
(Another strange item appears.)

632
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,260
It feels nice that they're so enthusiastic about this.

633
00:23:51,266 --> 00:23:53,845
They play yut like this?

634
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,000
If the sticks go up just this high,

635
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,300
- It's a fail, right? - it's a fail.

636
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,500
It's a fail.

637
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,770
Sir, can you demonstrate?

638
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:02,970
Your daughter-in-law...

639
00:24:02,978 --> 00:24:04,225
(Of course, I can demonstrate.)

640
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,525
(Here we go.)

641
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:11,995
(Here, I'm demonstrating.)

642
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,750
- It's a geol. - One stick went above the string.

643
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,520
There must be a technique to get one stick go higher.

644
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:22,030
There is another version.

645
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,205
Like this.

646
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:24,830
- It's a fail. - It's a fail.

647
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:27,260
- It's a fail. - It's okay when one stick is out.

648
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:28,270
(He takes a chance.)

649
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,630
Sir. Hold on.

650
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,100
- It's okay when one stick is out? - That's a fail.

651
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:33,570
That's a fail.

652
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,040
- Is it okay? - It's a fail when one is out.

653
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:36,455
It's a fail.

654
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:39,910
So at least one stick has to go above the string.

655
00:24:39,915 --> 00:24:41,480
If even one stick gets out, it's a fail.

656
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,580
If none of the sticks touches the string, it's a fail.

657
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,380
Your last try was a fail, right?

658
00:24:46,388 --> 00:24:48,020
- Yes. - Yes.

659
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:49,365
You denied it earlier.

660
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:50,750
It's a fail.

661
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,620
We should decide which team will be which color.

662
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:55,190
- Which color do you want? - Which color do you want?

663
00:24:55,197 --> 00:24:57,460
We want the passionate red.

664
00:24:57,466 --> 00:24:58,845
You want red.

665
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,700
(The color of Team Running Man will be blue.)

666
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:03,585
Let me see.

667
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:06,640
What if we get a mo from the beginning?

668
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:08,170
(Nervous)

669
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,940
You have to move your stones wisely.

670
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:10,940
Well...

671
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:13,110
(These old men seem to know a lot about yut.)

672
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:14,750
(How good are they?)

673
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,195
We should look closely.

674
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:21,990
(One stick gets out.)

675
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,550
- It's a fail, right? - It's a fail.

676
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,820
(Is it a fail?)

677
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:28,760
- It's a fail, right? - Yes.

678
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:30,830
- Okay. - You look annoyed.

679
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,030
- Are you okay? - It's better this way.

680
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:34,600
It's not good to start first.

681
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:37,270
- It's better to fail? - What? Of course.

682
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:39,315
If you start later, you can catch the other team.

683
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:41,300
That was your plan?

684
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:44,410
- No. It happened to be a fail. - All right.

685
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,810
I don't think this is the Shishimo rules.

686
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:47,580
They're just making everything up.

687
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,180
- I'm confused. - They're making it up.

688
00:25:49,184 --> 00:25:50,910
No, we're not.

689
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:52,135
(Will Team Island complete their mission?)

690
00:25:52,254 --> 00:25:56,465
(Team Hong Kong is attempting to accumulate 100 in queue numbers.)

691
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,620
There was a restaurant only a few steps away.

692
00:25:58,627 --> 00:25:59,835
That was close.

693
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,660
What if we don't get to eat?

694
00:26:02,664 --> 00:26:04,930
What if we only take buses before we go back to Korea?

695
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,060
No way.

696
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,670
How long do I have to be on the same team with Jae Seok?

697
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,770
(How long do I have to be on the same team with Jae Seok?)

698
00:26:11,773 --> 00:26:13,470
Hey.

699
00:26:13,475 --> 00:26:15,585
Let's get this straight.

700
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:18,280
Today, you chose me.

701
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,940
You guys attract each other like magnets.

702
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:22,395
I shouldn't be on the same team as So Min's.

703
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:23,950
It makes me shudder.

704
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:26,080
The air conditioner is off.

705
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,750
- Of course. - Se Chan, take your shirt off.

706
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,250
- It's cool in here. - Right?

707
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:33,135
You can keep your shirt on. It's okay.

708
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,590
I'm hot. Why do you say that?

709
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:37,090
- What's with you? - Calm down.

710
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:38,815
You're too worked up right now.

711
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:40,200
(Jae Seok checks Se Chan's eye.)

712
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,600
You're so worked up.

713
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,100
- Can you tell? - You're worked up.

714
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,700
- Are you a doctor? - Calm down.

715
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:46,715
- Calm down? - Trust me and calm down.

716
00:26:46,808 --> 00:26:48,285
This is strange.

717
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,610
On the bright side, 11 people were in line.

718
00:26:51,613 --> 00:26:53,040
- There were 11 people. - It counts.

719
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:54,950
Of course. Let's get off.

720
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,550
Let's go. We're finally here. It looks better here.

721
00:26:57,552 --> 00:26:58,580
There are many restaurants here.

722
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,750
There are more places on the left side.

723
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:02,665
There are so many people.

724
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:04,020
It's crowded.

725
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:05,490
- It's so crowded. - I like it.

726
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,205
It looks like Hong Kong now.

727
00:27:07,262 --> 00:27:09,690
- It's nice. - It looks like a Hong Kong street.

728
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:12,875
Listen carefully.

729
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,830
There are many lines here. We should choose wisely.

730
00:27:14,836 --> 00:27:16,830
I'm too scared to say anything.

731
00:27:16,838 --> 00:27:19,485
- So am I. - I'm scared.

732
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:21,585
I see a line over there.

733
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,210
(Jae Seok sees a line again.)

734
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,540
- It's a line. - 1, 2, 3, 4...

735
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,795
There are five people.

736
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,210
You have to get in line.

737
00:27:30,218 --> 00:27:32,120
- What is this line for? - Let's get in the line.

738
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,965
What's this place?

739
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:35,450
It's a restaurant.

740
00:27:35,457 --> 00:27:36,450
(They're lucky.)

741
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,790
- It's a restaurant. - It's a restaurant?

742
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:38,790
It's a restaurant.

743
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:40,705
(They're lucky because they're hungry.)

744
00:27:41,596 --> 00:27:42,790
How many people are in line?

745
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:45,160
When we first saw the line, there were five people.

746
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,260
- Okay. - So we'll count five.

747
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,270
(5 will count.)

748
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,030
- We have to choose what to eat. - What's that?

749
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,600
Isn't that Japanese ramen?

750
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:56,910
(Isn't that Japanese ramen?)

751
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:57,910
Well...

752
00:27:57,913 --> 00:27:59,740
- Isn't that Japanese ramen? - Isn't that Japanese ramen?

753
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:01,865
It's Japanese ramen.

754
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:05,880
Why did you say you saw a line? Watch your mouth.

755
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:07,820
- Ramen? - It's a ramen place.

756
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:09,250
Is this a follow-up to our Okinawa trip?

757
00:28:09,257 --> 00:28:11,005
(Is this a follow-up to our Okinawa trip?)

758
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:16,260
(Is the noodle torture starting again?)

759
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:17,630
When you're in Hong Kong...

760
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:19,560
You should try dim sum or xiaolongbao.

761
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:22,730
You have to eat here. At least one dish.

762
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:24,400
- Ramen... - Let's order ramen.

763
00:28:24,406 --> 00:28:26,785
This one.

764
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,370
- We might be able to eat. - Just one?

765
00:28:28,376 --> 00:28:29,470
- 2? - Yes, 2.

766
00:28:29,477 --> 00:28:31,485
Let's order this one too. What's that?

767
00:28:31,947 --> 00:28:33,410
(They have to obey the rules.)

768
00:28:33,415 --> 00:28:34,695
Thank you.

769
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:37,265
- Is this the place? - Yes.

770
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:39,780
(They're not allowed to shoot here.)

771
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:40,995
We can't?

772
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:43,135
We can't shoot here?

773
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,890
- Luckily, - Right.

774
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:48,290
we can't shoot here.

775
00:28:48,296 --> 00:28:50,090
Then it doesn't count?

776
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:51,800
The five people don't count.

777
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,300
- No? - It's not our fault.

778
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:54,660
The owner said no.

779
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,170
You have to experience the place for it to count.

780
00:28:57,172 --> 00:28:58,685
We don't have much time. Let's go.

781
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:01,910
This is why you should look carefully.

782
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,810
I thought it counts...

783
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:06,310
You're the one who should look more carefully.

784
00:29:06,314 --> 00:29:09,110
- Hey. - Watch your mouth.

785
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:11,680
Sushi. There's a sushi place.

786
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:12,680
(They look for another line.)

787
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:13,965
There's another line.

788
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:16,990
No. Don't look at it.

789
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:18,720
(Jae Seok is too careless.)

790
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:21,575
- Don't look at it. - Let me count.

791
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:24,245
Wait. We didn't see it.

792
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:25,960
- We didn't see the line. - 1, 2, 3, 4,

793
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,230
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. There are 10 people.

794
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:30,770
Let's get in the line.

795
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:32,370
- There are 10 people. - Let's get in the line first.

796
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:34,815
- What's this place? - It's a restaurant.

797
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:36,770
(Let's see what they have.)

798
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,710
- It's noodles again. - It's noodles again.

799
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,180
(It's a noodle restaurant again.)

800
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:42,895
(There are only noodles on the menu.)

801
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,910
It's a soba restaurant.

802
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:46,480
- What do they have? - Only noodles.

803
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:47,920
- Yakisoba. - Hold on.

804
00:29:47,922 --> 00:29:50,690
- It's a soba place again. - It's a soba place again.

805
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:52,735
- Isn't that soba? - It is.

806
00:29:53,194 --> 00:29:54,920
This is a problem.

807
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:57,575
(It looks like a cafe, but they have only noodles on the menu.)

808
00:29:57,665 --> 00:30:00,460
- This is not what we should eat. - We should eat xiaolongbao.

809
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:02,000
Should we ask if we can take out the food?

810
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:04,015
Should we get sandwiches?

811
00:30:04,406 --> 00:30:07,300
Chul Min, I don't think we can shoot here.

812
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:08,840
They've given us permission.

813
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:12,110
But my fans are going crazy.

814
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:14,280
(But my fans are going crazy.)

815
00:30:14,282 --> 00:30:17,510
What are you talking about? Come on.

816
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,550
- I think we can go in. - I don't want to...

817
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,990
cause too much trouble. Would it really be okay?

818
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:25,005
They say it's okay.

819
00:30:25,126 --> 00:30:28,605
(Now, they have no choice but to go in.)

820
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,030
Oh, this place is...

821
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,630
(Yu Jae Seok is here!)

822
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,730
It's very big.

823
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,315
(An enthusiastic welcome)

824
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:39,815
(They stop eating and welcome Jae Seok.)

825
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:44,585
(Hello, Hong Kong.)

826
00:30:45,013 --> 00:30:50,325
(Jae Seok just waved at me.)

827
00:30:51,553 --> 00:30:52,780
Hi.

828
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:54,995
You're a huge star here.

829
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:56,650
All right.

830
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,460
(We'd like to thank everyone for their cooperation.)

831
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,720
Oh, my.

832
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:01,005
Excuse me.

833
00:31:01,196 --> 00:31:03,290
(Se Chan takes off his shirt.)

834
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:04,505
Okay.

835
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:07,900
Take out the lint roller.

836
00:31:07,902 --> 00:31:09,200
(Take out the lint roller.)

837
00:31:09,204 --> 00:31:10,570
Why did you bring it?

838
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,900
(It's a must for a fashionista.)

839
00:31:13,908 --> 00:31:15,770
- Roll it. - It's...

840
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:18,580
(Let me roll it on your face.)

841
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,010
- Is it for your face? - Is this too unnatural?

842
00:31:21,015 --> 00:31:22,910
- It's for his face. - There's nothing.

843
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,310
Your t-shirt is so cute.

844
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,780
- Do you want to try? - I'm okay.

845
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:27,120
- I'm okay. - We don't need it.

846
00:31:27,122 --> 00:31:30,150
- How about your back? - It's okay.

847
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:31,190
Okay.

848
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:33,390
Cameras like this...

849
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:36,560
(Extreme close-up)

850
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,090
- This angle is... - It's very flattering.

851
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,560
This angle is flattering?

852
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:41,500
No angle is flattering for Jae Seok.

853
00:31:41,503 --> 00:31:43,570
(Let me film you at this flattering angle.)

854
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,045
You only see her forehead.

855
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:49,385
(Her face fills up the frame.)

856
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:51,840
(Let me try.)

857
00:31:51,846 --> 00:31:53,310
Han Na.

858
00:31:53,314 --> 00:31:54,940
Your eyes are very far apart.

859
00:31:54,949 --> 00:31:57,110
(Now that I see your face...)

860
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:59,020
(Hurt)

861
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,880
Do you get that a lot?

862
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,650
- Her eyes are far apart. - So Min.

863
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,550
This angle works best for you.

864
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,775
(The best angle for So Min)

865
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:09,660
- You look like Kim Kwang Kyu. - She looks cute.

866
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:12,615
You look just like Kwang Kyu.

867
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,315
Let me see.

868
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,785
(Upside down)

869
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:17,800
(Hello, teeth.)

870
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,900
- This is not okay. - Is that an alien?

871
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:23,270
You're so ugly.

872
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:24,485
(An alien from another star)

873
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,880
We're having so much fun with one selfie stick.

874
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,225
Isn't Hong Kong amazing?

875
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,410
You look so excited.

876
00:32:30,418 --> 00:32:32,220
If I did this to Jong Kook, he'd say,

877
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,080
"This is too unnatural. What are you doing?"

878
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:38,790
"Stop it. There are other cameras." I'm having so much fun.

879
00:32:38,793 --> 00:32:39,990
- Yes. - It makes me happy.

880
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:41,890
You can do whatever you want.

881
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,190
I'm so happy.

882
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:46,900
(Jong Kook, are you watching?)

883
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,360
- Our food is here. - Our food is here.

884
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,330
Thank you.

885
00:32:49,337 --> 00:32:51,000
- Thank you. - What's that?

886
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:52,685
- We'll gobble it up. - It looks tasty.

887
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,755
(They enjoy the food.)

888
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,510
It has a curry flavor.

889
00:32:57,512 --> 00:32:59,640
(The 10 people in the line are counted now.)

890
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,040
- It tastes good. - Right?

891
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,395
It has a charm.

892
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,910
- Let's do this. - Let's do well.

893
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,220
- We can do this. - We have to try xiaolongbao.

894
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:08,790
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

895
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,865
(Let's try some Hong Kong food next time.)

896
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,405
- We don't have much time. - Now,

897
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,560
- we don't have much time. - We don't.

898
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:16,660
Let's go to the place you know.

899
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:18,930
- Let's go. - Let's have some dumplings.

900
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,260
Se Chan, how do we get there?

901
00:33:20,268 --> 00:33:21,860
- Do we turn right? - Yes, we have to cross.

902
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,530
We need to follow the people.

903
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:25,815
No, no. They're just talking over there.

904
00:33:26,307 --> 00:33:27,500
Hey, there's a line here.

905
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,370
(Wait a second.)

906
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:31,340
- Hey, there's a line here. - Hold on a second.

907
00:33:31,346 --> 00:33:32,540
(What kind of line is it this time?)

908
00:33:32,547 --> 00:33:33,740
- Hold on a second. - Oh, no.

909
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:36,180
(Jae Seok spots a line across the dim sum restaurant.)

910
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,310
We have to get on the bus again.

911
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:39,950
(Unbelievable. It's a line for the bus again.)

912
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:41,295
All right. The line.

913
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:43,365
- There are five people here. - Come on, Jae Seok.

914
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,690
I told you we were going that way.

915
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:46,520
- Why did you mention the line? - Hold on.

916
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,675
He definitely said that there was a line.

917
00:33:49,297 --> 00:33:52,730
(Thanks to his mouth, the team finds a line again.)

918
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:54,360
Okay. We'll ride the bus again.

919
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:55,745
(Thanks to Jae Seok, they ride the bus again.)

920
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,945
Why do you keep mentioning lines?

921
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:00,540
- Stop mentioning it. - Okay.

922
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,370
- Tsim Sha Tsui is right there. - I got it.

923
00:34:02,377 --> 00:34:03,740
We can ride the bus there.

924
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,440
(They ride the bus right in front of Tsim Sha Tsui.)

925
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:07,955
- Let's ride it there. - I should ask them.

926
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,510
- "Ma'am". - A photo...

927
00:34:09,517 --> 00:34:11,410
(What?)

928
00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:12,520
- What did you say? - "Ma'am".

929
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,180
(Don't people say that in a gangster film?)

930
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:15,290
What was that?

931
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,905
- What did you say? Hold on. - I said, "ma'am".

932
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,920
- I was shocked. I thought... - Wait. You should've said this.

933
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,820
- Jae Seok. - I saw a lot of Hong Kong films.

934
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,260
- People understand this phrase. - This... It...

935
00:34:24,265 --> 00:34:26,460
- Isn't that a Busan dialect? - Hey.

936
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,830
- "Hey, I'll show you." - "Hey, listen up."

937
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,630
"Your father lives in Yeomchang-dong, right?"

938
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,830
- "Hey". Just like this. - "Hey".

939
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,700
My gosh, these two are like flies.

940
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:34,900
They're coming at me.

941
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,570
They keep gnawing and bothering me.

942
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,110
(They annoy him.)

943
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:41,910
- Hey, you. You can't... - What?

944
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,250
- say anything to Jong Kook. - Jae Seok.

945
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:44,750
Jong Kook always says this is unnatural.

946
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:47,080
This is so much fun. This isn't unnatural at all.

947
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:48,480
You're thriving today. You are.

948
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,020
- Right. This is great. - Se Chan is thriving.

949
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,450
Here it is. Here it comes.

950
00:34:51,459 --> 00:34:52,620
(They are forced to ride the bus again.)

951
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,620
- 4 people to Tsim Sha Tsui. - 4.

952
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:57,090
(After adding 5 more people, the accumulated number is 26.)

953
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:58,460
(Thank you.)

954
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,460
They startled me.

955
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:01,675
(Jae Seok is a top star.)

956
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,900
- With his mouth? - What did you mouth to them?

957
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,070
He mouthed, "Thank you."

958
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,640
- "Thank you." - "Thank you."

959
00:35:06,641 --> 00:35:08,400
- I thought he cursed at them. - I thought so too for a second.

960
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:09,670
- To them, you know. - Hey.

961
00:35:09,677 --> 00:35:11,425
This is what Jae Seok did.

962
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,640
(Mouthing)

963
00:35:13,648 --> 00:35:16,410
- They are giving us a big welcome. - Jae Seok looks...

964
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:18,880
- like a real man in Hong Kong. - I thought they wouldn't know.

965
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:22,820
- He was very ladylike in Japan. - Stop it.

966
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,620
(He was very ladylike in Japan.)

967
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,620
(He learned Japanese from a female voice actor in a translating app.)

968
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,990
(His Japanese was overly gentle.)

969
00:35:29,997 --> 00:35:31,430
- My gosh, this punk. - He's a man here.

970
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:33,375
(He's so manly in Hong Kong.)

971
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:34,930
- Let's get off. - Let's get off.

972
00:35:34,936 --> 00:35:36,430
Okay. Let's go eat dim sum. Let's get it.

973
00:35:36,437 --> 00:35:38,700
(They get off while hoping to find a dim sum restaurant with a line.)

974
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:39,940
Where are we?

975
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:42,855
- I think this is the harbor. - Really?

976
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:44,110
(The beautiful waterfront is seen at a glance.)

977
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,455
I can smell it already.

978
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:46,640
My gosh, look at that.

979
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,050
- Look at the boat. It's a boat. - Are we at the right place?

980
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,850
(Ferries that connect Hong Kong islands come and go at the harbor.)

981
00:35:50,852 --> 00:35:52,735
My gosh, look at the ferry. That looks so interesting.

982
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:54,195
It looks very vintage.

983
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,150
I just remembered something.

984
00:35:56,157 --> 00:35:58,020
It happened a long time ago, so I can't remember clearly.

985
00:35:58,025 --> 00:36:01,490
- 20 or 30 people waited in line. - Let's go there.

986
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:03,190
- We must think about our mission. - Let's go there.

987
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:04,560
- Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go.

988
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:06,800
- What about the dim sum? Please. - We can eat it on the other side.

989
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,530
- I hope there are 90 people, right? - Exactly.

990
00:36:08,536 --> 00:36:10,445
- It's because... - We should complete our mission.

991
00:36:10,605 --> 00:36:12,440
We should cross over straight away...

992
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,485
- And we'll have dim sum. - and end it after eating dim sum.

993
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,140
- Isn't this the line? Is this it? - 1, 2, 3, 4...

994
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:19,610
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - We will count 5 people.

995
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:21,010
(Unlike Jae Seok's memory, there are only 5 passengers.)

996
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:23,780
- All right. 5 people. - 6 people. Wait, wait.

997
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:26,395
- Let's wait a while. - We should wait for a bit more.

998
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:28,350
It became packed all of a sudden.

999
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:29,390
(The dock is swarming with people.)

1000
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,135
- This is great. - I don't know how many there are.

1001
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,890
There are many kids here too. They dropped the baggage.

1002
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,890
There are 15 people. 15 people.

1003
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:37,530
- There are 15 people. - We counted the heads earlier.

1004
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:40,530
(The producer can't accept it since he already counted before.)

1005
00:36:40,535 --> 00:36:42,400
- Okay, okay. We understand that. - So Min.

1006
00:36:42,403 --> 00:36:43,770
So Min, let's not play dirty.

1007
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:45,500
We should just go. We should just forget about it.

1008
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:46,940
So Min. Forget about it.

1009
00:36:46,941 --> 00:36:48,270
(My gosh, that producer gets on my nerves!)

1010
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:49,485
Come here.

1011
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:51,955
I'm sorry. She's a bit riled up.

1012
00:36:52,146 --> 00:36:53,410
Let me vote.

1013
00:36:53,414 --> 00:36:55,580
"Jung Chul Min".

1014
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:57,750
(She votes for the producer.)

1015
00:36:57,752 --> 00:36:59,480
- Let's go. Give us the money. - So Min, come here.

1016
00:36:59,487 --> 00:37:01,380
(They set out to ride the ferry after angrily casting her vote.)

1017
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,935
- Let's set out - Jae Seok, it's so pretty.

1018
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,405
My gosh, I feel like I'm on a trip.

1019
00:37:08,296 --> 00:37:09,960
(They get to admire the real side of Hong Kong for the first time.)

1020
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:11,530
My gosh, this is nice.

1021
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:14,560
- Do you know where you're going? - No.

1022
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:17,400
- You're going to Hong Kong Island. - Island?

1023
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:20,040
(I asked around and found out you're going to Hong Kong Island.)

1024
00:37:20,041 --> 00:37:22,470
- You're going to Hong Kong Island. - Hong Kong Island?

1025
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:24,070
Where is Hong Kong Island?

1026
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:25,510
We are already in Hong Kong. What do you mean by Hong Kong Island?

1027
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:26,940
(Where is this island that everyone is worried about?)

1028
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:30,110
(Hong Kong Island is the heart of politics and commerce.)

1029
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:32,420
(It's where all the popular places are clustered together.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1030
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,720
This is equivalent to Gangnam in Seoul.

1031
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,020
- That's great. - That's great.

1032
00:37:35,022 --> 00:37:37,790
- The buildings we saw from there... - It's all over there.

1033
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:39,520
- We arrived. - We are here.

1034
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:40,860
- Great. - This is excellent.

1035
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,135
(What will happened to Team Hong Kong?)

1036
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,360
(The members decide on who will zip line first.)

1037
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:48,215
(The director will spin it.)

1038
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:54,455
(Ji Hyo has 7 slots. Haha, Seok Jin, and Sang Yeob have 3 slots each.)

1039
00:37:55,076 --> 00:38:00,125
(Ji Hyo takes up 50 percent of the roulette, but you never know.)

1040
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:05,095
(Everyone is desperate to let the others ride the zip line.)

1041
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,120
The first one to ride it is...

1042
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:09,635
(Everyone wants to avoid the ride. Which member will be chosen first?)

1043
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:13,475
(Haha is chosen!)

1044
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:17,005
(He used up his luck for the day during the birthday game.)

1045
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,860
(Now, only 1 of the 3 members needs to be picked.)

1046
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,145
(The thought of it makes them retch.)

1047
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:26,400
I knew it. Today is Haha's day.

1048
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,670
(This guy who rode the Nevis Swing goes pale.)

1049
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:31,025
You should spin it. No practices. This is it.

1050
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:33,140
1, 2, 3.

1051
00:38:33,147 --> 00:38:34,210
- Start. - Start.

1052
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:35,410
- Spin it. - Start.

1053
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:39,450
(The roulette is spun to pick the last member.)

1054
00:38:39,453 --> 00:38:41,465
(She has 7 slots.)

1055
00:38:41,889 --> 00:38:46,190
(They each have 3 slots.)

1056
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,560
(Which member will join Haha?)

1057
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:52,205
(It's Sang Yeob.)

1058
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:56,385
(Yes Man is here to comfort me.)

1059
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:03,370
(He seems different from the time when he earned his nickname.)

1060
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:05,880
I knew it. I am the lucky one!

1061
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,295
Lady Luck is on my side.

1062
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,480
Seok Jin, my luck hasn't run out yet. It hasn't.

1063
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:12,225
Haha will ride it first, and then Sang Yeob will go.

1064
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,280
I'll ride it for our team's sake.

1065
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,320
(Haha gets ready for the zip line.)

1066
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:17,520
It looks quite windy.

1067
00:39:17,525 --> 00:39:19,890
- The weather... - I'm sorry. I'm easily scared.

1068
00:39:19,894 --> 00:39:21,020
(He's nervous as if he's in space.)

1069
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,405
I want to brave it out.

1070
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:25,900
My gosh. Goodness.

1071
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,460
Haha. Daddy is going to...

1072
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:28,660
Take a seat.

1073
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:30,030
- My goodness. - Your left foot.

1074
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,685
So Wool. Dream. Honey.

1075
00:39:33,107 --> 00:39:36,225
I rode the Nevis Swing. I can handle this.

1076
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,740
(I can ride this zip line.)

1077
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:43,765
(Just like that time, I can ride this fabulously.)

1078
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:46,920
(I thought it would end there. Why am I hanging here?)

1079
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:48,050
I'm going.

1080
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,565
(Why am I hanging here?)

1081
00:39:49,757 --> 00:39:51,165
He's removing the safety pin.

1082
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:53,460
1, 2.

1083
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,660
- My gosh. - Darn it!

1084
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:56,390
(Darn it. My gosh!)

1085
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,190
(It scares him too.)

1086
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,100
That's all right. That's all right. You can do this.

1087
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:02,300
- I love you. I love you. - You can do this.

1088
00:40:02,303 --> 00:40:03,330
You can do it!

1089
00:40:03,337 --> 00:40:05,230
- I love you! - Let's do this. This is nothing.

1090
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,300
Get ready.

1091
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:07,785
- 3. - 3.

1092
00:40:07,842 --> 00:40:11,510
- 2, 1. - 2, 1.

1093
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,710
(Haha is 1 second away from his 1st flight at 894m in Hadong.)

1094
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:15,850
Go!

1095
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,625
(Go!)

1096
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,765
Go!

1097
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:25,205
(Haha, the 1st rider, makes a great leap forward.)

1098
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:26,790
Go!

1099
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:32,560
(My gosh! Darn it. Goodness. Shoot!)

1100
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:36,545
(For how much longer will I go down?)

1101
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:39,340
No, no. I see a cliff.

1102
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,585
(The legend of Mount Geumo, the golden stork.)

1103
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,740
(He's losing it.)

1104
00:40:43,744 --> 00:40:45,010
No!

1105
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:47,010
So Wool. Dream.

1106
00:40:47,014 --> 00:40:48,440
(Stuttering)

1107
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:51,295
Go Eun. Hey, hey.

1108
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:55,135
(His facial expression is the same as that on the Nevis Swing.)

1109
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:57,750
Sang Yeob.

1110
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,720
(Laughing)

1111
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:00,860
(What's happening down there?)

1112
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:01,990
Sang Yeob, it's your turn.

1113
00:41:01,996 --> 00:41:04,075
(What's happening down there?)

1114
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:08,860
(Why am I here?)

1115
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,370
(Why was I so rash earlier?)

1116
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:16,355
(He wants to take back his generosity now.)

1117
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:18,755
Don't cry.

1118
00:41:19,246 --> 00:41:20,955
The wind... The wind is biting.

1119
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:24,565
My life up to this point...

1120
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:26,435
just flashed by.

1121
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:28,720
Dream. So Wool.

1122
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:30,220
Daddy...

1123
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:32,635
(Retching)

1124
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:35,120
Daddy loves you very much.

1125
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,560
(He's a bit shy to share his feelings.)

1126
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:38,145
I love you so much too, honey.

1127
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:39,915
And...

1128
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:42,515
I'd like to thank the viewers too.

1129
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,845
Let me open up now. I love you, Sung Yong.

1130
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:46,700
Sung Yong. Sung Yong.

1131
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,715
You must answer me when I'm talking to you!

1132
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,940
(Please stay by my side, my beloved ones.)

1133
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:52,425
Hurry. Stay next to me.

1134
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,855
I want to sing now.

1135
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,765
Life is full of opportunities

1136
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:03,890
I believe I can

1137
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,005
Darn it. I didn't curse. I didn't.

1138
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,420
10, 9, 8, 7...

1139
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:09,660
(This is what I meant.)

1140
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:11,930
I wish this could go faster.

1141
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,700
I'm almost there.

1142
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:15,700
Oh, no. What will I do? What will I do?

1143
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,545
(I can see the landing point at last.)

1144
00:42:18,973 --> 00:42:21,000
(Haha lands safely.)

1145
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:22,140
I'm about to pass out.

1146
00:42:22,143 --> 00:42:25,155
(Now that it's over, the self-pity he held back gets unleashed.)

1147
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:29,180
(This is Haha's first message after successfully landing.)

1148
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:32,395
What have I done wrong? Why do you always make me do this?

1149
00:42:33,254 --> 00:42:34,535
Jae Seok.

1150
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:36,365
Wait and see.

1151
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:38,905
I can't do this kind of activity.

1152
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:40,120
I have to ride another one?

1153
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:41,490
(If you make me do this again, I'll hate you.)

1154
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:42,530
You can do this!

1155
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,290
(Sang Yeob gets ready.)

1156
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:47,175
- My gosh. Goodness. My gosh! - A bit more.

1157
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:48,730
Sang Yeob, go for it.

1158
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:49,800
(He tries a new activity on this lucky day.)

1159
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:51,585
- 4, 3... - 3...

1160
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:55,415
- 3, 2, 1. - 3, 2, 1.

1161
00:42:57,711 --> 00:43:00,055
- Go! - Let's go!

1162
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,555
My gosh, it's fast. It's faster than I thought.

1163
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,410
- Go! - Let's go!

1164
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,820
(Screaming)

1165
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:08,435
Look at him with his arms wide open.

1166
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:16,175
(I will spread my wings and fly freely all over Hadong.)

1167
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:21,945
(Unlike Haha, Yes Man admires the nature and enjoys the ride.)

1168
00:43:26,006 --> 00:43:30,485
(He flies in the sky over Hallyeosudo.)

1169
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:35,780
(He passes through the wind as if he's sliding.)

1170
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:42,535
(He arrives at the destination in an instant.)

1171
00:43:44,058 --> 00:43:47,120
(The first flight is a success.)

1172
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:48,805
(He's moved.)

1173
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:50,590
Watch your feet.

1174
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:51,875
Watch the feet.

1175
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,830
(The spectacular view is hard to forget.)

1176
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:55,930
Put your feet.

1177
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,145
- It wasn't a big deal, right? - Good job.

1178
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:00,570
- Sang Yeob. - That was amazing.

1179
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:01,740
That was amazing.

1180
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,170
(Haha and Sang Yeob finish zip lining.)

1181
00:44:03,177 --> 00:44:04,855
Let's give them a round of applause.

1182
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:07,940
Yes Man.

1183
00:44:07,948 --> 00:44:09,280
Betraying Man.

1184
00:44:09,283 --> 00:44:10,410
Cross.

1185
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,665
(Yes Man and Betraying Man unite.)

1186
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,520
This makes me feel accomplished.

1187
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,535
Are you Yes Man, and is he Betraying Man?

1188
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,620
(They head to Incheon after clearing the mission.)

1189
00:44:18,626 --> 00:44:21,375
You have succeeded the mission.

1190
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,675
- Good job. - Let's go.

1191
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,390
- We're here. - We're here.

1192
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,530
We're here.

1193
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,560
We arrived.

1194
00:44:27,568 --> 00:44:28,730
(Team Hong Kong arrives on the island.)

1195
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:30,970
The weather is cooler here.

1196
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:32,770
- Really? - Hong Kong is better.

1197
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,215
I got it now.

1198
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:36,540
We have to go to the main street.

1199
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:39,310
It isn't so crowded here.

1200
00:44:39,313 --> 00:44:42,255
(That's strange.)

1201
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:44,080
It's almost empty.

1202
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:46,735
It must be here somewhere.

1203
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,535
We just can't find it.

1204
00:44:49,323 --> 00:44:52,220
Will there be a waiting line for the Ferris wheel?

1205
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,920
No, the seats are empty.

1206
00:44:53,928 --> 00:44:55,220
They're empty.

1207
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:57,405
Why isn't there a waiting line...

1208
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,260
- by the electronics store? - I don't think there are any.

1209
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:01,930
- It's completely empty. - Even the buses are empty.

1210
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:03,200
- There isn't anyone. - There's no one.

1211
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,715
Why isn't there a line?

1212
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:06,800
Let's go back.

1213
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:08,740
- Why aren't people waiting? - We shouldn't have taken the ferry.

1214
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:09,810
I know.

1215
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,440
- We shouldn't have taken the ferry. - Was that a mistake?

1216
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:12,610
(They trusted Jae Seok.)

1217
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:13,810
Did we make a mistake?

1218
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,040
- What happened? - Listen.

1219
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:18,180
I wanted to give you a ferry ride in Hong Kong.

1220
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:19,895
I got motion sickness.

1221
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:22,050
I'm about to throw up the noodles.

1222
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:24,435
The ride was good for the first three minutes.

1223
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:28,705
- What happened? - Wait, we still have three hours.

1224
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:30,990
I know what's here.

1225
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:34,300
People wait in line to get on the escalator.

1226
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:36,630
- Are they from "Chungking Express"? - Right.

1227
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:37,915
The movie "Chungking Express".

1228
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:42,385
(It's the world's longest escalator from "Chungking Express".)

1229
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:45,340
- That's it. - I know what it is.

1230
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:47,595
We should go there. It appeared on "Chungking Express".

1231
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:50,995
I played a game there on Running Man.

1232
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,820
That's where we should go.

1233
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,620
Will there be many people waiting to get on the elevator?

1234
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:56,690
- It's an escalator. - Right.

1235
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,820
- I hope there will be 50 people. - That would be amazing.

1236
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,460
- It's crowded here. - It's crowded.

1237
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,620
It's over here.

1238
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:03,760
- Aren't you happy that we're here? - Let's go farther.

1239
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,660
I agree with you for now.

1240
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,530
- Move out of the way. - Why?

1241
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:10,345
- Follow me. - He wants us to follow him.

1242
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:12,015
So Min, let's follow him.

1243
00:46:12,473 --> 00:46:15,000
- I think it's near here. - I think this is it.

1244
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:17,070
(They arrive at the entrance.)

1245
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:20,440
(Will it be crowded like Jae Seok said?)

1246
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:24,050
(There are many people on the escalator.)

1247
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:30,090
(How many people are waiting in line?)

1248
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,205
Is this the waiting line?

1249
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:33,860
- I think it's here. - What's this?

1250
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:36,130
(There's no waiting line.)

1251
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,860
This is the site from the movie.

1252
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:41,515
- Is this it? - It's where the line starts.

1253
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:44,785
You may get on it when there are five waiting in line.

1254
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:47,685
Wait a minute. They keep getting on it.

1255
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,100
How will there be a waiting line?

1256
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:50,570
- Is there a waiting line? - Wait.

1257
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:52,225
Is this where you meant?

1258
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:54,010
Is this where I was talking about?

1259
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:56,350
- Yes. - There should be a waiting line.

1260
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,010
(You said that there's a line.)

1261
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,250
Tell us.

1262
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:02,250
Is a waiting line possible for an escalator?

1263
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:03,990
- Wait a minute. - What is this?

1264
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,990
I'm not here to take you around.

1265
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:09,190
(I'm not your tour guide.)

1266
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:11,430
It's a misunderstanding. We're on Running Man.

1267
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:13,260
I'm not...

1268
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,100
your tour guide right now.

1269
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,970
I'm here to clear a mission with you.

1270
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:21,255
- There's no waiting line. - Right.

1271
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:23,970
- There is no line. - How is this possible?

1272
00:47:23,977 --> 00:47:25,040
There is...

1273
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:26,240
(That's strange.)

1274
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:28,410
- There's a famous egg tart place. - Where is that?

1275
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:30,610
After you take three sets of these escalators,

1276
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,410
- it's on the right. - That's right.

1277
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:33,965
- I saw it. - Let's go up.

1278
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:39,505
(It's a famous egg tart shop with a long, waiting line.)

1279
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,020
(I know it too.)

1280
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,960
- There's a famous place. - He didn't see it.

1281
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:44,060
- He's lying again. - Jae Seok.

1282
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,630
Don't agree with her. We'll just listen to her.

1283
00:47:45,632 --> 00:47:47,600
- I'm sure of it. - He'll jinx it again.

1284
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:49,430
There's definitely a waiting line. Let's go.

1285
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:51,700
- Then the escalator doesn't count. - Okay.

1286
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:54,415
- It doesn't count? - No.

1287
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:57,440
The egg tarts at that shop are very delicious.

1288
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:58,570
I've heard about it too.

1289
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:02,110
People still go even if they have to wait in line.

1290
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,310
We looked it up.

1291
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:05,810
A British governor couldn't forget the taste of this egg tart.

1292
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,380
- I know. - When he returned to the UK...

1293
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,320
He missed the egg tarts.

1294
00:48:09,323 --> 00:48:10,690
- Right. - So he came back.

1295
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,290
- How could it be so great? - This is good.

1296
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,390
(Their success rate is high.)

1297
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,260
It's on the right. I can smell it. Right?

1298
00:48:16,263 --> 00:48:18,930
Just wait and see. There will be 20 people waiting.

1299
00:48:18,932 --> 00:48:21,630
Wait and see. There will be a line.

1300
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:22,900
(They must find up to 100.)

1301
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:23,970
Isn't this it?

1302
00:48:23,971 --> 00:48:25,330
(They must find up to 100.)

1303
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:26,370
Is it here?

1304
00:48:26,373 --> 00:48:30,010
(How many people are waiting in line for this popular shop?)

1305
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,840
- Is it here? - There's no waiting line.

1306
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:34,780
(What's going on?)

1307
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,010
(It's completely empty.)

1308
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,695
- Isn't this the place? - Wait.

1309
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:40,395
This is it.

1310
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:42,395
Is it here?

1311
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,750
(It's usually so crowded.)

1312
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,060
(However, it's completely empty.)

1313
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:50,730
- There's no waiting line. - What happened, Han Na?

1314
00:48:50,731 --> 00:48:53,175
It's a famous, tasty restaurant.

1315
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:55,175
It's under construction.

1316
00:48:55,502 --> 00:48:58,685
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1317
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:02,800
Travel guidebooks always say that there's a long line.

1318
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,910
- There's a long, waiting line. - That's right.

1319
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:06,795
Then why is it so empty?

1320
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:10,210
(Hong Kong is full of waiting lines.)

1321
00:49:10,217 --> 00:49:13,420
(However, it's so empty today.)

1322
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,850
Nothing is going well today.

1323
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,020
(Let's think.)

1324
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:19,090
- What's going on? - I think it's because of So Min.

1325
00:49:19,092 --> 00:49:22,020
(He avoids taking responsibility.)

1326
00:49:22,029 --> 00:49:23,890
I thought I was unlucky,

1327
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:25,960
but every time I was unlucky, she was with me.

1328
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:29,900
Whenever I felt unlucky, Producer Jung was always around.

1329
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:32,145
I think he's the one.

1330
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:34,500
When I came here last time...

1331
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:35,940
(Let's go somewhere else.)

1332
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:37,210
There was a square.

1333
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,580
(Stop talking.)

1334
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,440
Don't ever come back to Hong Kong. Don't come back to Hong Kong.

1335
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,510
(They cover Jae Seok's mouth.)

1336
00:49:43,517 --> 00:49:44,550
Instead of this shop,

1337
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:46,110
- how about this one? - Where?

1338
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,220
- There's a temple in Hong Kong. - Will there be people?

1339
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,220
(They search a temple.)

1340
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:50,920
- Wouldn't this be a good place? - It looks empty.

1341
00:49:50,924 --> 00:49:52,835
I bet it's empty.

1342
00:49:52,893 --> 00:49:54,220
Let me explain.

1343
00:49:54,228 --> 00:49:58,075
To go back to Seoul, we must pass Tsim Sha Tsui anyway.

1344
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:00,260
- I recommend we go there. - Let's go to Tsim Sha Tsui.

1345
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,270
What will you do? Make a decision, Jae Seok.

1346
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,630
- It only takes five minutes. - On foot?

1347
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:05,670
Let's go.

1348
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,070
(Let's go to the temple.)

1349
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:09,655
If temple doesn't work, let's go to Tsim Sha Tsui.

1350
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:11,310
- Okay? - To the temple?

1351
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,080
Let's go to the temple.

1352
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,080
(They go to the temple.)

1353
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,780
We don't get to eat the tart.

1354
00:50:15,782 --> 00:50:18,510
I'm thirsty. Do we have to wait in line to get water?

1355
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:20,835
I can't believe that this is happening.

1356
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,490
Let's find at least 20 people at the temple.

1357
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:27,335
- I bet it's empty. - I think so too.

1358
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:29,090
We're almost there.

1359
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:30,560
- Where is it? - I think it's here.

1360
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:33,400
Is there... I think people are waiting in line.

1361
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,445
- Where? - I see some people.

1362
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:38,515
- I think there are some people. - They keep going in.

1363
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,715
There's a waiting line.

1364
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:43,770
(Many people are standing inside the temple.)

1365
00:50:43,777 --> 00:50:45,525
- This is the temple. - Okay.

1366
00:50:46,013 --> 00:50:47,525
Is this the entrance?

1367
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:49,580
It starts from here.

1368
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:54,680
(This place, which is empty, is the starting place.)

1369
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,035
The line starts here.

1370
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,020
When you look inside,

1371
00:50:58,025 --> 00:50:59,790
- people are waiting to get in. - No.

1372
00:50:59,793 --> 00:51:02,705
- There's no waiting line. - There's no line.

1373
00:51:02,763 --> 00:51:04,405
Who suggested this place?

1374
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:06,060
- Who suggested this place? - Jae Seok.

1375
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,845
Did Jae Seok suggest it?

1376
00:51:08,168 --> 00:51:11,070
- We suggested Tsim Sha Tsui. - We suggested Tsim Sha Tsui.

1377
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:12,785
Jae Seok suggested the temple first.

1378
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:16,610
(The three strongly recommended Tsim Sha Tsui.)

1379
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,625
(Jae Seok drags them to the temple.)

1380
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,095
How about this?

1381
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:22,710
Let's go to Tsim Sha Tsui.

1382
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:25,080
(Now, he suggests Tsim Sha Tsui.)

1383
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,620
- Tsim Sha Tsui. - Goodness.

1384
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:27,680
What did he say?

1385
00:51:27,688 --> 00:51:30,335
To get to Tsim Sha Tsui from here,

1386
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:33,105
you must go back and take the ferry.

1387
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,520
Why did we take the ferry in the first place?

1388
00:51:35,529 --> 00:51:37,760
- That's where we made the mistake. - It was the ferry.

1389
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,160
You have 1.5 hours until you have to go back.

1390
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:43,100
(They must go to the airport in 1.5 hours.)

1391
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:46,185
- 1.5 hours? - Is that all we have?

1392
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,940
(They must take the 5:30pm flight to return home.)

1393
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:54,440
We must go to Disneyland now.

1394
00:51:54,448 --> 00:51:56,825
We came all the way to Hong Kong.

1395
00:51:57,984 --> 00:52:00,620
This is what I think.

1396
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,565
I'm terribly unlucky.

1397
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,120
I really am.

1398
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,920
- You should accept it. - Right.

1399
00:52:06,927 --> 00:52:10,260
I think Jae Seok is cursed in Hong Kong.

1400
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:14,315
(He's definitely cursed in Hong Kong at this rate.)

1401
00:52:14,801 --> 00:52:16,715
- In Hong Kong? - Yes.

1402
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:19,130
You must be cursed.

1403
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:22,340
I don't think I can go back to Korea.

1404
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:24,170
People will criticize me if I go back like this.

1405
00:52:24,177 --> 00:52:26,680
We didn't get to enjoy Okinawa when we went there.

1406
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,040
We didn't even see the ocean.

1407
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:31,350
Listen, So Min. If I repeat this 2 to 3 times,

1408
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:33,420
people will think that I take horribly boring trips.

1409
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,450
(Jae Seok's horribly boring trips)

1410
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:37,950
- Jae Seok's trips? - Yes.

1411
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,590
Whatever place I suggest is horribly boring.

1412
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:41,820
It's not fun at all.

1413
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:45,705
(It's not fun at all after experiencing it.)

1414
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:49,160
- Seriously. - You only traveled with him once.

1415
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:51,500
- We couldn't eat egg tarts. - Han Na.

1416
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:54,355
- You're so talkative. - We couldn't eat xiaolongbao.

1417
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,370
What should I do?

1418
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:58,385
(Team Hong Kong's mission is over.)

1419
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:01,710
- Go. - Do well, Kwang Soo.

1420
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:03,980
- One of them must go higher. - It must go higher.

1421
00:53:03,984 --> 00:53:05,650
- Remember the string. - Okay.

1422
00:53:05,652 --> 00:53:07,395
- Good luck. - Throw them.

1423
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,365
- He got it. - Gae!

1424
00:53:10,056 --> 00:53:11,520
(Is it gae?)

1425
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,220
- It's gae. - Wait a minute!

1426
00:53:13,226 --> 00:53:14,360
- It's gae! - Isn't it geol?

1427
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,460
It's gae!

1428
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:17,360
(She interferes with the board.)

1429
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:18,630
- It's gae. - It's gae.

1430
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:20,260
Isn't this considered flipped?

1431
00:53:20,267 --> 00:53:22,300
It's on the bottom. It's gae.

1432
00:53:22,302 --> 00:53:23,970
- It's gae. - It's gae.

1433
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,970
- Gae! - Gae.

1434
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:27,770
- It feels... - Gae!

1435
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:30,410
- I know it's gae, but... - It's gae.

1436
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:31,710
(Even his team members say it's gae.)

1437
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:33,495
- Wait... - It's gae!

1438
00:53:33,713 --> 00:53:36,765
The daughter-in-law was like, "Gae!"

1439
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,210
- Here, sir. - I was surprised.

1440
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,950
- "Gae!" - Sir.

1441
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:43,505
We'll go this way.

1442
00:53:43,757 --> 00:53:46,035
- Catch them! - My goodness.

1443
00:53:46,092 --> 00:53:47,090
Catch them!

1444
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:50,875
(He throws the sticks with a shout.)

1445
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:52,830
- Geol! - Gosh.

1446
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:54,760
If ours had been geol, we would have been caught.

1447
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:55,760
Okay.

1448
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,470
- Above the string? - Yes.

1449
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:59,045
- Above the string. - Above.

1450
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:00,500
- Above the string. - Do it.

1451
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:02,255
Don't cheat.

1452
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:04,340
Everyone is so sensitive right now.

1453
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:08,355
If they don't go above the string, it's a fail.

1454
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:10,710
(It's too low.)

1455
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:12,010
- It's too low. - It's too low.

1456
00:54:12,018 --> 00:54:13,780
It didn't go above the string.

1457
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:14,950
It didn't.

1458
00:54:14,955 --> 00:54:17,550
(Laughing)

1459
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:19,605
He's too happy.

1460
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,175
He's really happy.

1461
00:54:22,562 --> 00:54:25,760
Don't think they'll go easy on us. It's not like that.

1462
00:54:25,765 --> 00:54:27,460
Throw them up high.

1463
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:30,345
- If it's a fail... - Fail.

1464
00:54:31,204 --> 00:54:32,445
Fail!

1465
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:33,970
(Glaring)

1466
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:36,615
Why did you say that?

1467
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:38,985
I said it very quietly.

1468
00:54:39,446 --> 00:54:40,740
- I'm sorry. - Don't worry.

1469
00:54:40,747 --> 00:54:42,610
- I said it quietly. - Geol.

1470
00:54:42,616 --> 00:54:44,210
(It's Kwang Soo's turn, and they need geol.)

1471
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:46,480
- Look closely. - Geol.

1472
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:48,620
- Fail! - Hey.

1473
00:54:48,622 --> 00:54:50,405
(Fail)

1474
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:53,150
(Yelling)

1475
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,705
Come on.

1476
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:56,490
Focus.

1477
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,405
Did you hear her voice? "Focus."

1478
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:01,300
Gosh. It's driving me crazy.

1479
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:03,670
Okay. You better not make any mistakes.

1480
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:04,900
Her voice changed.

1481
00:55:04,905 --> 00:55:06,100
(The second oldest brother goes.)

1482
00:55:06,106 --> 00:55:09,100
It must be a fail.

1483
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,770
- Fail! - It's a fail.

1484
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,210
It's touching.

1485
00:55:12,212 --> 00:55:13,795
(His daughter-in-law steps up.)

1486
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,595
- Hold on. - It's a fail.

1487
00:55:15,615 --> 00:55:17,095
Hold on.

1488
00:55:17,117 --> 00:55:19,680
- Hold on. - Look.

1489
00:55:19,686 --> 00:55:22,220
Look at this. It's not touching.

1490
00:55:22,222 --> 00:55:24,290
- It's obviously... - It's touching.

1491
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:25,590
(Take a look.)

1492
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:27,320
- It's touching. - It's not.

1493
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:30,230
Hold on. She just pushed me.

1494
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,445
Is it okay?

1495
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:34,100
It's not touching.

1496
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,060
- It's a fail. - Yes, it is.

1497
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:38,830
- Okay. - He brought a camera right away.

1498
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,300
Good job.

1499
00:55:40,307 --> 00:55:42,485
- You were insisting. - Good job.

1500
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,940
Da Hee, we have to catch them.

1501
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:47,140
- Yes. - What do you want?

1502
00:55:47,147 --> 00:55:48,940
- What do you want? - Yut would be the best.

1503
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,295
Yut.

1504
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,125
Either yut or mo.

1505
00:55:52,152 --> 00:55:54,720
- Can I throw them like this? - Yes.

1506
00:55:54,721 --> 00:55:56,220
- It's okay. - Right?

1507
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:57,490
Hold on.

1508
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:00,090
You're being too generous with Da Hee.

1509
00:56:00,093 --> 00:56:02,220
- Can I throw them like this? - Yes.

1510
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:04,175
It doesn't matter.

1511
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,505
Ta-da.

1512
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,560
- If it's... - It's touching!

1513
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:09,200
- It's touching! - It's gae.

1514
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:11,600
- It's gae. - Should we run away?

1515
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:12,670
We should listen to Da Hee.

1516
00:56:12,672 --> 00:56:15,600
If we get geol and then gae, we can go there.

1517
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:16,610
All right.

1518
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,725
(It's the daughter-in-law's turn.)

1519
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:20,455
It's a fail.

1520
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,880
- Gae. - Gae.

1521
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:23,610
- Let's catch them! - Let's catch them!

1522
00:56:23,617 --> 00:56:24,710
Let's catch them.

1523
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:25,810
(Laughing)

1524
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:27,335
- You should run away. - Throw them up high.

1525
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:30,450
(Thanks to the daughter-in-law, the brothers are ahead.)

1526
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:32,320
- Geol. - Geol.

1527
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:35,205
Catch them with gae and make a turn with geol.

1528
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:36,790
(What?)

1529
00:56:36,796 --> 00:56:39,560
- Make a turn? - Yes. That's what we say.

1530
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:41,760
- Make a turn? - You make turns at the corners.

1531
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,930
- Here too. - Ma'am.

1532
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:46,030
(You can make turns at the corners.)

1533
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,155
He's using professional terms.

1534
00:56:49,142 --> 00:56:52,555
(He hasn't shown off all his skills yet.)

1535
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:54,940
That's not okay. We'll get a back do.

1536
00:56:54,948 --> 00:56:56,340
(It's neck and neck.)

1537
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:57,565
We'll get a back do.

1538
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,165
- Yut! - Yut!

1539
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,950
- He can throw them again. - It's yut.

1540
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,520
(Amazed)

1541
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:04,950
How can he get only one stick above the string?

1542
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:06,220
I'm finally showing off my skills.

1543
00:57:06,226 --> 00:57:08,220
- I tried to copy him. - There you go.

1544
00:57:08,228 --> 00:57:09,220
- Gae. - Gae.

1545
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:12,060
He throws one first.

1546
00:57:12,065 --> 00:57:13,700
- Try it. - He's stubborn.

1547
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,130
- Throw one first? - Yes, do it.

1548
00:57:15,135 --> 00:57:17,500
- Just try it. - Try it.

1549
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:20,500
(The old men have fabulous skills.)

1550
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:21,700
(Will Kwang Soo...)

1551
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:25,355
(be able to copy him?)

1552
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:27,680
Wait.

1553
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:29,355
(What?)

1554
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:32,110
(He throws one...)

1555
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:34,435
(and puts the other three down gently.)

1556
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:37,120
(What is that?)

1557
00:57:37,123 --> 00:57:38,850
He threw only one.

1558
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:40,760
He shouldn't just put the others down.

1559
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,190
You're confusing it with another game.

1560
00:57:42,195 --> 00:57:45,330
You throw 1, and drop the other 3.

1561
00:57:45,331 --> 00:57:48,300
Let him try again. He didn't know.

1562
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:49,860
Kwang Soo didn't know. You can try again.

1563
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:52,900
- Drop the other three? - Just throw them.

1564
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,670
You have only one chance.

1565
00:57:54,674 --> 00:57:56,100
Do it well.

1566
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:57,985
Good. You threw them well.

1567
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,710
- Geol. - Geol.

1568
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:01,240
- We should catch them. - Let's catch them!

1569
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:02,810
Do, gae, geol.

1570
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,080
- We've been caught. - One more time.

1571
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:06,720
Kwang Soo, good job.

1572
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,935
I'm sorry, sir.

1573
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:09,880
I'm sorry, sir.

1574
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:11,935
We caught you once too.

1575
00:58:12,058 --> 00:58:13,220
- You have to... - This feels nice.

1576
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:14,905
catch the other team.

1577
00:58:15,862 --> 00:58:17,790
- Good. That was nice. - Nice.

1578
00:58:17,797 --> 00:58:20,060
(Kwang Soo throws a mo.)

1579
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:21,300
- It's mo. - It's mo.

1580
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:22,900
Throw them again first. We'll decide later.

1581
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:24,130
Sir.

1582
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:25,415
Good.

1583
00:58:26,072 --> 00:58:28,315
If it's do...

1584
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:32,725
(The man makes monkey sounds.)

1585
00:58:32,846 --> 00:58:36,225
Hold on. Can he do that?

1586
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:37,510
(It's allowed on this island.)

1587
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:39,410
It's allowed.

1588
00:58:39,419 --> 00:58:40,850
- It's okay? - It's okay.

1589
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:43,020
- Is it really okay? - It is.

1590
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,290
- Sabotage. - Sabotage is allowed.

1591
00:58:45,291 --> 00:58:47,190
Of course. As long as you don't touch them.

1592
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:48,675
(I have to focus.)

1593
00:58:49,763 --> 00:58:50,975
(Attack)

1594
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:53,760
(He's so cute.)

1595
00:58:53,767 --> 00:58:56,330
- We shouldn't lose. - We won't.

1596
00:58:56,336 --> 00:58:58,185
It's a fail.

1597
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:00,500
This works best.

1598
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:03,555
We have to win. Otherwise, we can't leave.

1599
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,825
It's too late to leave.

1600
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:07,755
You have to win to leave.

1601
00:59:07,847 --> 00:59:11,695
Can I use earphones?

1602
00:59:11,785 --> 00:59:14,920
(The men's strategy even surprises the cheaters.)

1603
00:59:14,921 --> 00:59:16,150
We need earplugs.

1604
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:18,905
My opponent makes sounds, and my team members rush me.

1605
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:20,920
- You have only 30 seconds. - 30 seconds?

1606
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:22,605
(Hurry up.)

1607
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:26,330
A time limit has been added. You have only 30 seconds.

1608
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:28,600
- Is there such a thing? - This is not baduk.

1609
00:59:28,601 --> 00:59:31,585
- Why 30 seconds? - Hold on.

1610
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,455
There's no way we can beat them.

1611
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:36,885
(The more you learn, the harder it becomes.)

1612
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,510
Your chance is gone after 30 seconds.

1613
00:59:38,511 --> 00:59:41,210
Hurry up. I told you.

1614
00:59:41,214 --> 00:59:43,310
- I'm stressed out. - It's like baduk.

1615
00:59:43,316 --> 00:59:44,950
I just want to escape.

1616
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:46,510
- Hurry. - Okay.

1617
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,995
(Kwang Soo throws the sticks under stress.)

1618
00:59:49,355 --> 00:59:50,890
It's a fail.

1619
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:52,405
- It could have been yut. - Hey.

1620
00:59:52,792 --> 00:59:54,020
Focus.

1621
00:59:54,027 --> 00:59:55,675
(Laughing)

1622
00:59:56,796 --> 00:59:59,060
(My strategy worked.)

1623
00:59:59,065 --> 01:00:01,930
He gets on people's nerves.

1624
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:03,600
He's so happy. He's laughing.

1625
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:04,600
(That's how we play around here.)

1626
01:00:04,604 --> 01:00:08,015
We need do to catch them.

1627
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:11,285
(Let me show you my skills.)

1628
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:13,425
(Show them.)

1629
01:00:14,514 --> 01:00:15,510
Here we go.

1630
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:16,755
- Don't get them out. - It's a fail!

1631
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,465
You get them out every time!

1632
01:00:18,885 --> 01:00:23,135
(The youngest is the least skilled.)

1633
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:26,235
- He got scolded. - Okay.

1634
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:28,935
Da Hee should throw yut, right?

1635
01:00:29,062 --> 01:00:32,790
I'm usually not that lucky.

1636
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,915
You can do this.

1637
01:00:35,935 --> 01:00:37,145
It's yut!

1638
01:00:37,704 --> 01:00:39,870
- Throw them one more time. - It's yut!

1639
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:41,940
(I'm not supposed to be good at this game.)

1640
01:00:41,941 --> 01:00:43,500
Throw them one more time.

1641
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,870
- Da Hee. Pull yourself together. - Da Hee.

1642
01:00:45,879 --> 01:00:47,240
- Hold on. - We need geol.

1643
01:00:47,247 --> 01:00:48,995
- Geol. - Let's do this.

1644
01:00:50,283 --> 01:00:52,050
- Yut! - It's yut.

1645
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:53,080
(Another yut)

1646
01:00:53,086 --> 01:00:54,680
- Throw them one more time. - Yut.

1647
01:00:54,687 --> 01:00:56,765
- One more time. - Good.

1648
01:00:56,823 --> 01:00:58,665
- Is it good? - Yes. Good job.

1649
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:01,305
We need geol.

1650
01:01:02,428 --> 01:01:03,490
Yut!

1651
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:04,930
(Three yuts in a row)

1652
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:06,230
Da Hee!

1653
01:01:06,232 --> 01:01:07,900
- Da Hee, let's go! - Let's go!

1654
01:01:07,901 --> 01:01:09,100
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1655
01:01:09,102 --> 01:01:10,930
Three yuts. Now, we need geol.

1656
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:12,970
Geol and something else.

1657
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:14,500
(She can throw whatever and still be the MVP.)

1658
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:17,040
Geol.

1659
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:18,525
(Da Hee casually throws the sticks again.)

1660
01:01:18,878 --> 01:01:20,010
It's the fourth yut!

1661
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,255
- Yut! - What's going on?

1662
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:27,720
(What is going on?)

1663
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,365
I'm getting scared now.

1664
01:01:30,256 --> 01:01:31,565
Da Hee.

1665
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:33,590
- Da Hee. - What's going on?

1666
01:01:33,593 --> 01:01:35,060
- Good. - Da Hee.

1667
01:01:35,061 --> 01:01:37,375
Look at the men's faces.

1668
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:40,190
We need geol.

1669
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:42,615
- Geol. - Geol.

1670
01:01:44,237 --> 01:01:45,570
- Geol. - Geol!

1671
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,900
- Hold on. - Good.

1672
01:01:47,907 --> 01:01:50,710
Catch them, and throw the sticks again.

1673
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,940
What did you do?

1674
01:01:51,945 --> 01:01:53,340
- Da Hee. - What is this?

1675
01:01:53,346 --> 01:01:55,655
- How did you do that? - I don't know.

1676
01:01:55,815 --> 01:01:58,465
- Anything is fine. - Yes.

1677
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:01,220
(Da Hee's final try)

1678
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,695
- Do. - Do.

1679
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,650
- Okay. - Okay.

1680
01:02:04,657 --> 01:02:06,960
- The tables have turned. - You did an amazing job.

1681
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,490
- It was fantastic. - You did it.

1682
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:09,790
- Now, we just have to... - Da Hee.

1683
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:12,130
- We just have to finish. - It was amazing.

1684
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:13,460
We just have to finish well.

1685
01:02:13,466 --> 01:02:15,300
- Unbelievable. - Hold on.

1686
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:17,570
Ma'am, why are you glaring at me?

1687
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,870
I didn't...

1688
01:02:18,871 --> 01:02:20,970
- Stop annoying her. - I mean...

1689
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:24,710
- Even the way you look is annoying. - I didn't throw them.

1690
01:02:24,711 --> 01:02:26,240
All right. Let's go.

1691
01:02:26,245 --> 01:02:28,610
(The daughter-in-law throws.)

1692
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:29,855
- Gae. - Gae.

1693
01:02:30,316 --> 01:02:32,350
We're in trouble. We need something big.

1694
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:34,735
- Hold on. - Is it my turn?

1695
01:02:34,821 --> 01:02:37,120
- You have 30 seconds. - This is our last try.

1696
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:38,690
What? It's our last try.

1697
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:40,290
- Then... - A situation like this...

1698
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:41,920
doesn't happen often.

1699
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:43,290
Kwang Soo, please.

1700
01:02:43,296 --> 01:02:44,590
Kwang Soo, everything depends on you.

1701
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:47,330
Kwang Soo.

1702
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:48,830
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1703
01:02:48,835 --> 01:02:50,300
Kwang Soo, please.

1704
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:53,200
Let's go home. We might not be able to leave.

1705
01:02:53,206 --> 01:02:54,700
(Focused)

1706
01:02:54,707 --> 01:02:57,870
Anything except a back do would be fine.

1707
01:02:57,877 --> 01:02:59,355
It's a fail!

1708
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:02,310
(It works best right before throwing.)

1709
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:05,895
You seem to only disturb me.

1710
01:03:06,419 --> 01:03:09,335
He must think I'm his rival.

1711
01:03:09,622 --> 01:03:11,390
- Only me... - You two...

1712
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:12,920
- look alike. - That's right.

1713
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:14,660
When he was young...

1714
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,090
You two look like each other.

1715
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:18,390
- You do. - Yes, you do.

1716
01:03:18,398 --> 01:03:21,675
- Don't they look like each other? - Even their smiles are similar.

1717
01:03:22,135 --> 01:03:23,560
Kwang Soo, those from up above...

1718
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:25,200
- will help us. - This depends on you.

1719
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:27,240
(Kwang Soo, let's go back home.)

1720
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,340
This depends on you.

1721
01:03:28,341 --> 01:03:29,670
- You just need a good one. - Hurry up.

1722
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,740
- Fail. - It can be anything...

1723
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:34,010
- as long as it's not a back do. - Kwang Soo.

1724
01:03:34,013 --> 01:03:35,525
This depends on you!

1725
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:37,310
Please, Kwang Soo.

1726
01:03:37,316 --> 01:03:39,680
We're being helped by those from up above.

1727
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:43,695
(The mission is over if he gets mo or do. It's up to Kwang Soo.)

1728
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,750
- as long as it's not a back do. - Kwang Soo.

1729
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:48,261
This depends on you!

1730
01:03:48,861 --> 01:03:50,063
Please, Kwang Soo.

1731
01:03:50,063 --> 01:03:52,432
We're being helped by those from up above.

1732
01:03:52,432 --> 01:03:56,436
(The mission is over if he gets mo or do. It's up to Kwang Soo.)

1733
01:03:57,403 --> 01:03:58,905
Hey!

1734
01:03:58,905 --> 01:04:01,074
(He got mo, but it went outside.)

1735
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:02,842
- Hey! - Hey.

1736
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:05,545
(It's like making a dish and knocking it over.)

1737
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:08,114
- Hey! - It's over.

1738
01:04:08,314 --> 01:04:10,616
- Are you a spy? - It's mo, but it's out.

1739
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:13,186
(His distraction worked.)

1740
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,221
(Are you sure you don't have a secret mission?)

1741
01:04:15,221 --> 01:04:16,923
You must be so unlucky.

1742
01:04:16,923 --> 01:04:18,224
(They're speechless.)

1743
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:21,360
You were trying to be funny.

1744
01:04:22,795 --> 01:04:24,263
I can't continue. My heart...

1745
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:27,700
Hey, you. What are you doing?

1746
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:30,303
- It went out. - It was almost over.

1747
01:04:30,303 --> 01:04:33,106
- Back do, okay? - All right.

1748
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,112
(Please get do or mo, Jong Kook.)

1749
01:04:39,112 --> 01:04:40,379
It's back do.

1750
01:04:40,379 --> 01:04:45,084
(If he gets do or mo, they can go to Incheon Airport right away.)

1751
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,654
- It's geol. - He got geol.

1752
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:50,389
Why are you doing this too?

1753
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:53,426
(The guys feel really guilty now.)

1754
01:04:53,426 --> 01:04:54,560
- It's geol. - He got geol.

1755
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,761
Why are you doing this too?

1756
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:58,531
(The guys feel really guilty now.)

1757
01:04:59,432 --> 01:05:02,235
Good job. Congratulations.

1758
01:05:02,235 --> 01:05:04,504
Why does this keep happening?

1759
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:06,706
First of all,

1760
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:09,475
you won in the game of yut,

1761
01:05:09,742 --> 01:05:11,644
but you failed the mission.

1762
01:05:11,644 --> 01:05:14,313
(They won the game but couldn't win with mo or do.)

1763
01:05:15,615 --> 01:05:17,183
Can we play another game?

1764
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:18,885
(He looks miserable.)

1765
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:21,354
- We couldn't focus. - We'll try...

1766
01:05:21,354 --> 01:05:22,622
We'll try to tone it down.

1767
01:05:22,622 --> 01:05:25,124
We won't be too happy or anything.

1768
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:26,659
- Sir. - We're okay.

1769
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:28,594
- One more game? - In this game,

1770
01:05:28,594 --> 01:05:29,962
it's best 2 out of 3.

1771
01:05:29,962 --> 01:05:32,131
(What are you talking about?)

1772
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:33,900
That's the rule.

1773
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,835
- This is Shinshimo Island! - It can't be just one game.

1774
01:05:35,835 --> 01:05:37,603
- Great. - Good point.

1775
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:39,872
- You're the master of this game. - That's right.

1776
01:05:39,872 --> 01:05:43,176
Let's select him as a human cultural asset.

1777
01:05:43,543 --> 01:05:45,711
Let's select this village as the village of yut.

1778
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,181
- To get on the cruise... - His wife is here.

1779
01:05:48,181 --> 01:05:50,116
- Oh, dear. - Hello, ma'am.

1780
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:52,084
Are you playing a game here?

1781
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:55,254
- Yes, we are. - Did you hear our rules?

1782
01:05:56,155 --> 01:05:57,290
You have to throw it above this line.

1783
01:05:57,290 --> 01:05:59,525
I'm bad. Just play.

1784
01:05:59,892 --> 01:06:00,960
(She's jolly.)

1785
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,261
Kwang Soo.

1786
01:06:03,095 --> 01:06:06,065
(Da Hee is the first to go.)

1787
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,301
(Geol)

1788
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:09,936
- Geol. - Geol.

1789
01:06:09,936 --> 01:06:11,070
It's okay, ma'am.

1790
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,005
(First player on the other team is the wife.)

1791
01:06:13,005 --> 01:06:14,440
Here you go.

1792
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,243
- I hope she doesn't get geol. - Please throw it above the string.

1793
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:20,913
(She throws it indifferently.)

1794
01:06:20,913 --> 01:06:23,182
- What is it? - It's geol.

1795
01:06:23,182 --> 01:06:25,785
Catch her. That changes the lead.

1796
01:06:25,785 --> 01:06:29,455
In the beginning, you said, "I'm bad."

1797
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:30,923
I'm bad.

1798
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:34,026
- I'm bad. - She's good at catching up.

1799
01:06:34,393 --> 01:06:36,162
It's mo!

1800
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:37,663
(She said that she's bad, but she gets mo.)

1801
01:06:37,663 --> 01:06:40,132
(Let's go, honey.)

1802
01:06:40,132 --> 01:06:42,535
- Sir, it's mo. - It's mo.

1803
01:06:42,902 --> 01:06:45,204
It's mo

1804
01:06:45,204 --> 01:06:47,673
- She gets another try. - One more time.

1805
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:48,975
(She gets to play 3 times during her 1st turn.)

1806
01:06:50,843 --> 01:06:54,213
- Geol. - That changes the flow of the game.

1807
01:06:54,213 --> 01:06:56,716
She's really good at this.

1808
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,584
We were going soft.

1809
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:00,086
(Did you see that?)

1810
01:07:00,086 --> 01:07:01,854
(His wife is actually the best player.)

1811
01:07:01,854 --> 01:07:04,590
I keep getting geol. I hope I get yut.

1812
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:06,325
(You should have ended it earlier.)

1813
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:08,594
It doesn't feel right.

1814
01:07:08,594 --> 01:07:09,895
(Running Man doesn't have many chances left.)

1815
01:07:10,062 --> 01:07:12,365
- Gae. - Gae? It's gae.

1816
01:07:12,732 --> 01:07:16,135
Is that good? Just go around.

1817
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,904
- You're going around anyway. - Like this?

1818
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:21,774
I have a question. I'm not clear about this.

1819
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:23,209
Can you move your piece after you put it down?

1820
01:07:23,209 --> 01:07:26,679
It's supposed to be final once you put it down.

1821
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:28,514
That's how it is for us.

1822
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:30,249
- We're not sure. - We don't know.

1823
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:31,484
In those situations,

1824
01:07:31,484 --> 01:07:32,885
- you have to say, "pudong". - Sorry?

1825
01:07:32,885 --> 01:07:33,953
Say, "pudong".

1826
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:35,955
(Pudong?)

1827
01:07:35,955 --> 01:07:37,023
What's that?

1828
01:07:37,023 --> 01:07:39,725
That means you can't move. That makes it final.

1829
01:07:40,693 --> 01:07:42,295
You have to say it then.

1830
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:44,764
- Do we have to say it? - You can't move then.

1831
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:46,365
- If we say it? - Yes.

1832
01:07:46,365 --> 01:07:47,933
(If you say it, the other team can't move their piece again.)

1833
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,702
I think you made it up.

1834
01:07:49,802 --> 01:07:51,370
- Does that rule exist? - Just listen to him.

1835
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,605
- Are you supposed to say that? - Just do it.

1836
01:07:52,605 --> 01:07:54,040
- Okay. - That's the rule.

1837
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:55,941
We can do this.

1838
01:07:55,975 --> 01:07:59,445
- I'm starting to get dazed. - Hold on.

1839
01:07:59,445 --> 01:08:00,479
I'm most curious about this.

1840
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:02,715
Do these people truly live on Shinshimo Island?

1841
01:08:02,882 --> 01:08:04,550
Didn't you recruit them?

1842
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:06,852
Let's go for geol.

1843
01:08:07,353 --> 01:08:10,790
(He tries to focus and throws the yut.)

1844
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:13,592
- This is... - It's back do.

1845
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:14,994
(Back Do)

1846
01:08:14,994 --> 01:08:16,195
Back do.

1847
01:08:16,195 --> 01:08:17,430
(Laughing)

1848
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:20,166
(I want to escape this island.)

1849
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,233
Geol?

1850
01:08:21,233 --> 01:08:24,403
- Do I catch up to them with geol? - No, but you'll get close to them.

1851
01:08:24,603 --> 01:08:26,872
- I need geol then. - Geol.

1852
01:08:27,073 --> 01:08:28,874
- Is it geol? - It's gae.

1853
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:30,343
- Okay. - It's gae.

1854
01:08:30,343 --> 01:08:31,544
Use this other piece.

1855
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:33,045
Use the other piece.

1856
01:08:33,045 --> 01:08:34,413
- The one at the front. - Is it my turn?

1857
01:08:34,513 --> 01:08:36,015
Pudong!

1858
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:37,083
- Pudong! - Pudong!

1859
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,951
(Nice one.)

1860
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:40,519
Nice. Good job.

1861
01:08:40,519 --> 01:08:42,955
- That's how you do it, right? - That's it, right?

1862
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:45,424
- Right? - Good job.

1863
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:46,759
I learned it.

1864
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:49,295
- Good job. - I said it.

1865
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,731
- You remembered. - Good job.

1866
01:08:51,764 --> 01:08:53,332
- Yes, sir. - Good one.

1867
01:08:53,332 --> 01:08:55,234
We almost got into trouble.

1868
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:56,902
(With Kwang Soo's "pudong", they reclaim the flow.)

1869
01:08:57,203 --> 01:08:58,871
- It's yut. - It's yut.

1870
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,506
Good job.

1871
01:09:00,673 --> 01:09:01,774
- It's do. - Do.

1872
01:09:01,774 --> 01:09:03,075
(Running Man is close behind the other team.)

1873
01:09:03,075 --> 01:09:05,611
I guess you play this game all the time.

1874
01:09:06,045 --> 01:09:07,513
Do you know what our problem is?

1875
01:09:07,513 --> 01:09:09,215
- The end. - I know.

1876
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:11,784
- The process is good. - Where is it?

1877
01:09:11,784 --> 01:09:14,420
(They only have two spaces to go.)

1878
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,755
Like this?

1879
01:09:15,855 --> 01:09:17,456
We're good leading up to this.

1880
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,592
- It's do. - Do.

1881
01:09:19,592 --> 01:09:21,861
(They move a space.)

1882
01:09:21,861 --> 01:09:23,329
You need another one.

1883
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:24,463
(Kwang Soo gets the last chance again.)

1884
01:09:24,463 --> 01:09:27,533
It's do. Kwang Soo, I gave you a turn.

1885
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:29,402
- Mo or do. - It's mo or do.

1886
01:09:29,402 --> 01:09:30,703
I can't do this.

1887
01:09:30,703 --> 01:09:32,505
Kwang Soo, I gave you a chance.

1888
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:34,140
- Why did you do that for? - Do it.

1889
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,474
(You should have finished it off.)

1890
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,710
- This is our only chance. - Oh, my.

1891
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:38,811
Throw it.

1892
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:40,646
(While Kwang Soo is resenting, the other team plays.)

1893
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:42,181
This is up to you. Hurry up.

1894
01:09:42,181 --> 01:09:43,582
We can't do this.

1895
01:09:44,483 --> 01:09:46,051
Please say, "start" with me!

1896
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:47,486
(It's finally my turn.)

1897
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:51,290
1, 2, 3.

1898
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,825
- Start! - Start!

1899
01:09:55,094 --> 01:09:57,329
I can feel how desperate you are.

1900
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:59,732
- Mo or do. - Please, Kwang Soo.

1901
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:01,834
(The team's fate depends on Kwang Soo's throw.)

1902
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:06,372
(If he gets mo or do, the mission is a success.)

1903
01:10:06,372 --> 01:10:07,940
It's mo. It's do.

1904
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,074
(What?)

1905
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:10,576
- It's do! - But it's out.

1906
01:10:10,576 --> 01:10:11,944
You're going out.

1907
01:10:13,879 --> 01:10:15,714
- It's do! - But it's out.

1908
01:10:15,714 --> 01:10:17,983
(It's do, but it's outside again.)

1909
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,152
- It's do! - But it's out.

1910
01:10:20,152 --> 01:10:21,454
It touched!

1911
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:23,255
- It touched. - It's a fail.

1912
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:24,990
What is wrong with you?

1913
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,893
It's difficult doing that all the time.

1914
01:10:27,893 --> 01:10:29,094
(Wait, I've seen this situation before.)

1915
01:10:29,094 --> 01:10:31,263
(Don't be so hard on me. After me...)

1916
01:10:31,263 --> 01:10:32,865
(is you.)

1917
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:34,800
- Jong Kook. - Why is it me again?

1918
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,202
- Jong Kook. - This?

1919
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:38,103
Gather your energy.

1920
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:40,639
You should have ended it.

1921
01:10:41,073 --> 01:10:44,076
No, you'll be fine. You have the energy.

1922
01:10:44,076 --> 01:10:46,245
- Let's do this. It's possible. - 1, 2, 3.

1923
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:48,013
- 1, 2, 3. Start! - Start!

1924
01:10:48,013 --> 01:10:49,482
Let's go!

1925
01:10:49,682 --> 01:10:53,285
(If he gets mo or do, the mission is a success.)

1926
01:10:53,285 --> 01:10:56,055
(If they fail the mission, they get 40 Running Balls.)

1927
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:58,824
(What's the result?)

1928
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:02,995
(Do)

1929
01:11:02,995 --> 01:11:04,396
It's do!

1930
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:08,801
(They finally did it.)

1931
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:10,236
It's do!

1932
01:11:11,904 --> 01:11:14,673
(She's losing it.)

1933
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:20,212
It's do!

1934
01:11:20,446 --> 01:11:24,650
We got do, sir.

1935
01:11:25,084 --> 01:11:26,352
This is seriously...

1936
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:28,354
- Jong Kook. - That was so difficult.

1937
01:11:28,454 --> 01:11:30,856
What did I say?

1938
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:33,158
Hey, we did it.

1939
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,060
- That was the best game of my life. - That was so hard.

1940
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,962
It's the 1st time in 33 years that I felt so thrilled.

1941
01:11:36,962 --> 01:11:39,765
- I sweated so much. - Goodness.

1942
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:41,400
- That was the best. - Thank you, ma'am.

1943
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:44,303
Thank you for your time.

1944
01:11:44,303 --> 01:11:45,704
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1945
01:11:45,704 --> 01:11:47,139
Thank you for entertaining us.

1946
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,874
- It was so much fun. - I agree.

1947
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:51,544
- We felt like a family. - That's true.

1948
01:11:51,544 --> 01:11:53,145
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1949
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:55,714
- Thank you. - Please be well. Thank you.

1950
01:11:55,714 --> 01:11:57,383
Thank you very much.

1951
01:11:57,783 --> 01:12:00,920
(All three teams have completed their missions.)

1952
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:05,024
(The conclusion of Family Package Project.)

1953
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:07,259
This is bad.

1954
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:09,194
Did they fail?

1955
01:12:09,194 --> 01:12:11,564
Se Chan, it's going to be you.

1956
01:12:11,564 --> 01:12:13,699
I know it's going to be me. I already think that way.

1957
01:12:13,866 --> 01:12:15,901
Lastly, Han Na...

1958
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:18,203
picked Se Chan. So...

1959
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:19,505
Hey, look.

1960
01:12:19,505 --> 01:12:20,906
So what does that mean?

1961
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:22,441
Se Chan got the most votes...

1962
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,609
(He got 70 more Running Balls as a penalty.)

1963
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:25,511
- You'll get 20 Running Balls. - Poor you.

1964
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:28,013
What did I do so wrong?

1965
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:30,649
Haha's...

1966
01:12:31,083 --> 01:12:33,085
love, Seok Jin.

1967
01:12:34,086 --> 01:12:36,355
- I love you. - Hey, you...

1968
01:12:36,355 --> 01:12:38,023
You two talked about this, right?

1969
01:12:38,524 --> 01:12:39,625
I'll say it one at a time.

1970
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:40,960
Jin Young...

1971
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,995
- voted for Kwang Soo. - Really?

1972
01:12:42,995 --> 01:12:45,464
Jong Kook voted for Kwang Soo.

1973
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:47,299
(Jong Kook voted for Kwang Soo too.)

1974
01:12:47,299 --> 01:12:48,701
- Da Hee... - Yes.

1975
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,669
I won't leave you alone.

1976
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:52,471
Kwang Soo.

1977
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,872
(She also voted for him.)

1978
01:12:54,473 --> 01:12:57,376
- You never know. - We were thinking the same.

1979
01:12:57,376 --> 01:12:58,811
Kwang Soo...

1980
01:12:59,645 --> 01:13:02,214
picked Kwang Soo.

1981
01:13:02,815 --> 01:13:04,016
Really?

1982
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:06,518
- Hey. - Really?

1983
01:13:06,518 --> 01:13:07,953
- Stop lying. - Really?

1984
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,122
He erased it and wrote his name down.

1985
01:13:10,122 --> 01:13:11,323
(He's so sly.)

1986
01:13:11,624 --> 01:13:13,025
My gosh, I knew it.

1987
01:13:13,025 --> 01:13:15,294
Did you write your name instead?

1988
01:13:16,395 --> 01:13:18,664
(Se Chan has 71, Jae Seok has 16, Da Hee has 15, and Seok Jin has 5.)

1989
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:20,566
Da Hee has 14.

1990
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,604
(All balls are put together, and 6 are picked for Shuddering Package.)

1991
01:13:25,604 --> 01:13:27,406
(Once the spaces are filled, they will turn the roulettes for...)

1992
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:29,775
(Luxury Package, Shuddering Package,)

1993
01:13:29,775 --> 01:13:30,843
(and then the people going on those trips.)

1994
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:31,910
This is the end.

1995
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:34,179
(Today, the destinations and the people will be decided.)

1996
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:36,181
Will it be decided today?

1997
01:13:36,181 --> 01:13:37,383
Yes, it will be.

1998
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:39,785
All right. We'll pick out the balls now...

1999
01:13:39,785 --> 01:13:41,820
to put people's names down for Shuddering Package.

2000
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:45,324
Before we start, there's one additional rule.

2001
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,326
Once the Running Balls are selected,

2002
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:50,796
if somebody has been picked already...

2003
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:52,331
For example, if Se Chan gets picked first...

2004
01:13:52,331 --> 01:13:53,866
and he gets picked again,

2005
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:56,135
then he can pick another person...

2006
01:13:56,135 --> 01:13:58,270
- to join the Shuddering Package. - Pardon?

2007
01:13:58,270 --> 01:14:01,273
(If a name gets repeated, they can choose a person to join the list.)

2008
01:14:01,273 --> 01:14:02,574
Do I get to pick?

2009
01:14:02,574 --> 01:14:04,743
- If it gets repeated? - He'll be choosing the whole time.

2010
01:14:04,743 --> 01:14:06,045
(Se Chan has many Running Balls, so it's good news for him.)

2011
01:14:06,145 --> 01:14:07,813
You should try to avoid it.

2012
01:14:07,813 --> 01:14:09,815
- Get ready. - You should try to avoid it.

2013
01:14:09,815 --> 01:14:13,218
Everybody, get ready. You better be nervous.

2014
01:14:13,218 --> 01:14:14,953
All of you, got it?

2015
01:14:15,054 --> 01:14:16,922
He should try to avoid getting picked.

2016
01:14:16,922 --> 01:14:20,693
Why didn't you point at Jong Kook?

2017
01:14:20,693 --> 01:14:21,794
At that instant,

2018
01:14:21,794 --> 01:14:22,895
I felt like my finger would break.

2019
01:14:22,895 --> 01:14:25,464
I was going down and thought my finger would break.

2020
01:14:25,864 --> 01:14:28,634
(He was pointing at everybody...)

2021
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:30,202
(and skipped Jong Kook.)

2022
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:31,904
(His finger wanted to survive.)

2023
01:14:31,904 --> 01:14:33,105
Hey.

2024
01:14:33,105 --> 01:14:34,473
Why aren't you acting like earlier?

2025
01:14:34,473 --> 01:14:36,575
- I couldn't do it. - Se Chan.

2026
01:14:36,575 --> 01:14:38,744
He sent many messages to Jong Kook in Hong Kong.

2027
01:14:38,744 --> 01:14:40,112
Wasn't that edited out?

2028
01:14:40,112 --> 01:14:41,513
- No. - No, it'll be aired.

2029
01:14:41,513 --> 01:14:43,082
Did you say something to me?

2030
01:14:43,082 --> 01:14:45,751
You punk. I'll make sure I watch it.

2031
01:14:45,951 --> 01:14:48,454
(I'm so happy Jong Kook is not here.)

2032
01:14:48,821 --> 01:14:50,956
(Are you watching, Jong Kook?)

2033
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:54,426
(He went with the flow and warned Jong Kook many times.)

2034
01:14:54,793 --> 01:14:57,663
(Jong Kook took the message.)

2035
01:14:58,263 --> 01:15:00,566
So Min too. Han Na said something too.

2036
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:02,434
- Really? - I think I did something wrong.

2037
01:15:02,434 --> 01:15:04,536
Okay. Okay!

2038
01:15:04,903 --> 01:15:07,172
(Can you edit it out? Please.)

2039
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:08,273
He said, "okay".

2040
01:15:08,273 --> 01:15:09,575
(For everybody's peace, the originals were put away.)

2041
01:15:09,575 --> 01:15:11,009
- Should we put them in? - Yes.

2042
01:15:11,143 --> 01:15:12,945
- Let's go. - All of them?

2043
01:15:12,945 --> 01:15:14,813
Se Chan has so many.

2044
01:15:14,813 --> 01:15:17,750
- Okay, I'm the lead today. - He has the attention.

2045
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,752
Let's just enjoy this.

2046
01:15:19,752 --> 01:15:21,620
(Se Chan has 60 percent of the balls, so he has given up.)

2047
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,856
(Running Balls are picked for the Shuddering Package roulette.)

2048
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:25,124
(If there's a repeat, they can pick a different person.)

2049
01:15:25,124 --> 01:15:27,259
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2050
01:15:27,259 --> 01:15:28,660
What now?

2051
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,696
(Se Chan, Jae Seok, Da Hee, and Seok Jin have the highest chances.)

2052
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:32,131
You have...

2053
01:15:32,131 --> 01:15:34,566
one Running Ball each, and imagine if you get picked.

2054
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:35,901
- That's not possible. - It's up to chance.

2055
01:15:35,901 --> 01:15:37,870
I hope it's not me.

2056
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:39,938
You never know about this.

2057
01:15:39,938 --> 01:15:41,140
All right.

2058
01:15:41,473 --> 01:15:43,075
- Why are there so many? - Catch it.

2059
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:44,643
- Just pick one. - Let's go!

2060
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,345
It's just one.

2061
01:15:46,445 --> 01:15:48,714
- Just one. I'll put these back. - No.

2062
01:15:48,714 --> 01:15:51,016
The second ball was Da Hee's.

2063
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:52,584
I'll put the rest back in.

2064
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:54,453
How do we do this?

2065
01:15:54,453 --> 01:15:55,921
(She only has 15, but she almost got picked.)

2066
01:15:55,921 --> 01:15:58,390
1st ball. 1st...

2067
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,725
It must be Se Chan.

2068
01:16:00,392 --> 01:16:01,760
This is the first person.

2069
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,895
(Is it Se Chan with over 60 percent chance...)

2070
01:16:02,895 --> 01:16:06,131
(or somebody else?)

2071
01:16:10,035 --> 01:16:11,069
It's Da Hee.

2072
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:13,005
(What?)

2073
01:16:13,806 --> 01:16:14,873
(Sighing)

2074
01:16:14,873 --> 01:16:16,842
- Why? - I beat her.

2075
01:16:17,276 --> 01:16:18,610
This is unbelievable.

2076
01:16:18,844 --> 01:16:20,779
It's Da Hee.

2077
01:16:20,779 --> 01:16:22,881
- Why? - I beat her.

2078
01:16:22,915 --> 01:16:24,650
- This is unbelievable. - Hold on.

2079
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,452
Se Chan has 70.

2080
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,122
It's 70 versus 14.

2081
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:32,424
- This is insane. - Get her sticker.

2082
01:16:32,424 --> 01:16:34,593
- It's Da Hee. - Hold on.

2083
01:16:34,593 --> 01:16:35,961
Stick it on the pink area.

2084
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:37,329
- Next. - Please.

2085
01:16:37,329 --> 01:16:39,064
There's a good chance.

2086
01:16:39,064 --> 01:16:40,666
Spin it.

2087
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,334
She had 14 and got picked.

2088
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:44,136
Please be me.

2089
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:47,239
Please be me. Please pick me, Jae Seok.

2090
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:49,174
- You got it. - There it is.

2091
01:16:50,008 --> 01:16:52,211
If it's not me, I'm really lucky.

2092
01:16:53,045 --> 01:16:54,680
(Who's the second one?)

2093
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:55,914
It's Se Chan.

2094
01:16:55,914 --> 01:16:57,683
(Of course.)

2095
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,985
- Of course. - That was obvious.

2096
01:16:59,985 --> 01:17:01,653
Of course.

2097
01:17:01,653 --> 01:17:04,089
- Se Chan is here. - It's a formula.

2098
01:17:04,089 --> 01:17:06,859
- Put it on the pink. - Da Hee and Se Chan are confirmed.

2099
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:09,194
If they get picked again,

2100
01:17:09,194 --> 01:17:10,863
- They get to choose, right? - they get to choose.

2101
01:17:10,863 --> 01:17:11,864
Please let it be me.

2102
01:17:11,864 --> 01:17:13,732
(Whose Running Ball will it be next?)

2103
01:17:13,732 --> 01:17:14,800
Who is it?

2104
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,103
(Please... Please...)

2105
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:19,805
- Da Hee. - Goodness.

2106
01:17:19,805 --> 01:17:21,473
(It's Da Hee again.)

2107
01:17:21,874 --> 01:17:23,876
(She gets to choose.)

2108
01:17:23,876 --> 01:17:25,143
Are you happy?

2109
01:17:25,544 --> 01:17:28,513
- Look at Kwang Soo's face. - Don't do it.

2110
01:17:28,814 --> 01:17:30,649
Is that all you can show me?

2111
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:32,284
"Is that all you can show me?"

2112
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:35,654
(He kneels down.)

2113
01:17:36,154 --> 01:17:38,323
You're so desperate.

2114
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:40,259
"You're so desperate."

2115
01:17:42,361 --> 01:17:43,362
(Begging)

2116
01:17:43,362 --> 01:17:47,532
- "You're so desperate." - He's so desperate.

2117
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:51,270
Da Hee, 1, 2, 3.

2118
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:52,571
(Kwang Soo pleaded. Who will it be?)

2119
01:17:52,571 --> 01:17:53,639
Kwang Soo.

2120
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:56,341
(It's Kwang Soo.)

2121
01:17:56,742 --> 01:17:58,410
You're going on the Shuddering Package.

2122
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:00,479
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2123
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:03,415
- Things go around. - Congratulations.

2124
01:18:03,415 --> 01:18:05,484
I remember you picking her.

2125
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:06,885
Best of luck.

2126
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:09,354
Congratulations.

2127
01:18:09,755 --> 01:18:12,324
- Let's continue. - This is so much fun.

2128
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:13,425
Da Hee?

2129
01:18:13,425 --> 01:18:15,794
(The fourth ball comes down.)

2130
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:17,029
My gosh. What now?

2131
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:19,331
The next ball was Se Chan's.

2132
01:18:20,065 --> 01:18:22,134
- I hope I get picked. - It squeezed out.

2133
01:18:22,134 --> 01:18:23,168
Let's go.

2134
01:18:23,168 --> 01:18:24,369
(Whose ball is the fourth one?)

2135
01:18:24,503 --> 01:18:26,538
- Jin Young. - What?

2136
01:18:26,538 --> 01:18:30,509
(What? Jin Young only had 1 Running Ball.)

2137
01:18:30,509 --> 01:18:31,743
- Jin Young? - You?

2138
01:18:31,910 --> 01:18:33,478
What do you mean?

2139
01:18:33,478 --> 01:18:35,714
- Didn't she have 1? - She only had 1.

2140
01:18:35,914 --> 01:18:37,582
Congratulations.

2141
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:39,084
- You were too lucky today. - Congratulations

2142
01:18:39,084 --> 01:18:40,953
You have to choose.

2143
01:18:41,053 --> 01:18:42,621
- Jae Seok. - Is this even possible?

2144
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:44,489
It's her first time getting picked for the Shuddering Package.

2145
01:18:44,489 --> 01:18:47,092
What's going on?

2146
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,193
- Hey. - What is this?

2147
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:49,494
- Nothing lasts. - There are two left.

2148
01:18:49,494 --> 01:18:50,762
(There are 2 spaces left. The 5th Running Ball comes down.)

2149
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:52,664
I hope Jae Seok gets picked.

2150
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:57,135
- I think I can avoid this. - Please.

2151
01:18:57,502 --> 01:19:00,005
- Se Chan. - Okay.

2152
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:03,542
(Se Chan gets to pick somebody else.)

2153
01:19:06,845 --> 01:19:08,680
(Laughing)

2154
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:11,149
(He's anxious.)

2155
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:14,219
- Jae Seok is so cheeky. - Don't give him a peck.

2156
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:17,856
- He keeps on saying, "Seok Jin". - What are you talking about?

2157
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:20,025
I'm going to hit your mouth.

2158
01:19:20,592 --> 01:19:22,194
(They're fighting for Se Chan's love.)

2159
01:19:22,194 --> 01:19:23,495
- Se Chan. - Yes.

2160
01:19:24,396 --> 01:19:25,564
You know, right?

2161
01:19:25,864 --> 01:19:28,100
Don't hold his hands. Se Chan.

2162
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,068
(He gives a politician smile.)

2163
01:19:30,068 --> 01:19:32,671
- Why are your hands so warm? - He's like a politician.

2164
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:35,273
- I have a warm heart. - His hands are warm.

2165
01:19:35,374 --> 01:19:36,808
- It looks like you're campaigning. - I'll decide.

2166
01:19:36,808 --> 01:19:38,043
Wait.

2167
01:19:38,143 --> 01:19:40,579
(He wants to recommend Sang Yeob.)

2168
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:43,281
- What? What did you do? - What did you just do?

2169
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:44,549
It's Seok Jin.

2170
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:46,051
What was that?

2171
01:19:46,051 --> 01:19:47,619
(He provoked Se Chan...)

2172
01:19:47,619 --> 01:19:50,322
(then hit his cap.)

2173
01:19:51,623 --> 01:19:53,225
(What did you just do?)

2174
01:19:53,225 --> 01:19:54,993
- Hold on. - Look at him.

2175
01:19:54,993 --> 01:19:56,395
Wait. Why did you hit me?

2176
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:58,063
- He hit me. - Hey!

2177
01:19:58,063 --> 01:19:59,765
- I choose Seok Jin. - I couldn't understand that.

2178
01:19:59,765 --> 01:20:01,099
Why did you manipulate this?

2179
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:02,934
- What did I do? - Okay.

2180
01:20:02,934 --> 01:20:05,303
- Seok Jin. - He tried to drag me in.

2181
01:20:05,303 --> 01:20:06,638
(It's Da Hee, Se Chan, Kwang Soo, Jin Young, and Seok Jin.)

2182
01:20:06,638 --> 01:20:09,174
- I must have been crazy. - Why did you do that?

2183
01:20:09,174 --> 01:20:11,643
- You never know. - I can avoid this.

2184
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:13,478
Last space.

2185
01:20:13,478 --> 01:20:15,213
(This person will fill in the last space.)

2186
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:17,682
Please. I don't want to get picked.

2187
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:19,184
- Just one. - How will I live?

2188
01:20:19,184 --> 01:20:20,819
Please. I'm lucky.

2189
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:23,555
Last space. Rest are all Luxury Packages.

2190
01:20:25,223 --> 01:20:27,692
(The last ball comes down.)

2191
01:20:28,293 --> 01:20:29,394
It's Se Chan again.

2192
01:20:29,394 --> 01:20:30,729
- Second ball is mine? - It's all probability.

2193
01:20:30,729 --> 01:20:33,331
(According to probability, Se Chan has the highest chance.)

2194
01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:36,034
(Even if you have one Running Ball, you can't be sure.)

2195
01:20:36,034 --> 01:20:40,072
(Who's the last person to go on the Shuddering Package list?)

2196
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:41,740
It's Se Chan.

2197
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,208
Okay!

2198
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:44,443
(It's Se Chan again.)

2199
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:46,978
What did you say to me in Hong Kong again?

2200
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:49,614
(Are you talking about me?)

2201
01:20:49,614 --> 01:20:52,684
Oh, dear. You should have kept your mouth shut.

2202
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:55,620
You should have kept your mouth shut.

2203
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:58,056
You should have stayed quiet.

2204
01:20:58,056 --> 01:21:01,093
- Se Chan is so cool. - Why did you do that to me?

2205
01:21:01,693 --> 01:21:03,528
So Min. So Min and Han Na.

2206
01:21:03,929 --> 01:21:06,865
- Them? - Han Na keeps looking away.

2207
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:08,133
Wait. Han Na and...

2208
01:21:08,133 --> 01:21:10,469
I've never heard Jae Seok being so polite.

2209
01:21:11,136 --> 01:21:13,105
- I know. - Don't say anything.

2210
01:21:13,271 --> 01:21:16,341
- Don't say anything. - Oh, gosh. Hold on.

2211
01:21:16,341 --> 01:21:17,776
This is a dilemma.

2212
01:21:17,776 --> 01:21:19,644
- Han Na and So Min. - Why me?

2213
01:21:19,644 --> 01:21:20,812
What is the problem, Se Chan?

2214
01:21:20,812 --> 01:21:22,013
(She's polite.)

2215
01:21:22,414 --> 01:21:25,283
- Why? Earlier, you were... - What is the problem?

2216
01:21:25,283 --> 01:21:27,119
You were happy when you were giving me 70.

2217
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:29,454
What is the problem? I wanted to go to Tsim Sha Tsui.

2218
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:31,289
What about Jong Kook?

2219
01:21:31,289 --> 01:21:32,824
Jong Kook, come here for a second.

2220
01:21:32,824 --> 01:21:35,260
(He's confident.)

2221
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,595
Jong Kook?

2222
01:21:36,595 --> 01:21:38,163
You can put my sticker down.

2223
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:40,866
(He doesn't care.)

2224
01:21:40,932 --> 01:21:43,201
- What's wrong? - That's not how you do this.

2225
01:21:43,201 --> 01:21:44,436
What's wrong?

2226
01:21:44,436 --> 01:21:46,204
- Are you mad? - Hey.

2227
01:21:46,204 --> 01:21:47,739
- Stick it on. - That's not what I meant.

2228
01:21:47,739 --> 01:21:48,740
Hold on.

2229
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,109
(Put me on the Shuddering Package.)

2230
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:53,345
- Hold on. - Move.

2231
01:21:53,345 --> 01:21:55,013
- Let go! - Don't do it.

2232
01:21:55,013 --> 01:21:56,748
- Resist. - Stop it.

2233
01:21:56,748 --> 01:21:59,184
- Stop him. - This isn't necessary.

2234
01:21:59,184 --> 01:22:00,519
(Kwang Soo kicks Se Chan.)

2235
01:22:01,653 --> 01:22:03,755
- Stick it on. - This isn't necessary.

2236
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:05,423
- Calm down. - For goodness' sake.

2237
01:22:05,423 --> 01:22:07,926
I don't care either way. Stick it on.

2238
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,094
It won't hurt me.

2239
01:22:09,094 --> 01:22:10,996
- Calm down. - Stick it on.

2240
01:22:10,996 --> 01:22:12,364
I am envious of him.

2241
01:22:12,364 --> 01:22:13,865
- How is he so confident? - Hey!

2242
01:22:13,865 --> 01:22:15,133
- Stick it on. - What?

2243
01:22:15,133 --> 01:22:17,169
- Put my sticker on it. - Okay! I will do that.

2244
01:22:17,169 --> 01:22:18,170
Hey.

2245
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,471
(Is that so?)

2246
01:22:19,471 --> 01:22:21,039
(He attempts to imitate Jong Kook and gets chosen instead.)

2247
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:22,274
Come on!

2248
01:22:23,175 --> 01:22:24,176
(That's not how you do it.)

2249
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:25,544
- For goodness' sake. - Okay!

2250
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,179
- It's done, right? We passed. - It's done.

2251
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:29,080
- Yes! - Yes!

2252
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:31,183
- I got the Luxury Package! - We did it!

2253
01:22:31,183 --> 01:22:33,552
- We did it. - I got the Luxury Package.

2254
01:22:33,552 --> 01:22:34,553
I did it once.

2255
01:22:34,553 --> 01:22:36,154
Where does it go?

2256
01:22:36,154 --> 01:22:38,323

I will work harder.

2370

(Through this roulette, some will enjoy their time in Switzerland...)

2408
01:28:35,713 --> 01:28:37,115
(while the others will cry of terror in the UK.)

2426
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:12,183
I won't get it. I got it! I got it!

2427
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:15,453
(Luxury Package: Haha, Jong Kook,)

2428
01:29:15,453 --> 01:29:18,656
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Han Na, and Jin Young)

2429
01:29:19,424 --> 01:29:23,461
(Shuddering Package: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Kwang Soo,)

2430
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:26,931
(So Min, Sang Yeob, and Da Hee)

2431
01:29:27,332 --> 01:29:28,933
I got it!

2432
01:29:28,933 --> 01:29:31,336
I am going to Switzerland!

2433
01:29:32,270 --> 01:29:33,571
My goodness.

2434
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:35,373
(A slot's difference on the roulette changes the members' fate)

2435
01:29:35,673 --> 01:29:38,476
(We love Switzerland.)

2436
01:29:39,944 --> 01:29:41,713
That was incredible.

2437
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:43,214
- I can't believe it. - My heart is pounding.

2438
01:29:43,481 --> 01:29:45,850
- This is crazy. - Isn't this Week One?

2439
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,952
- This is Week One, right? - Come here.

2440
01:29:47,952 --> 01:29:49,454
You jerk!

2441
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:51,656
This is your fault.

2442
01:29:52,924 --> 01:29:55,126
Gather around if you went to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

2443
01:29:55,126 --> 01:29:56,861
- Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear. - Raise your hand.

2444
01:29:56,894 --> 01:29:58,930
- How about the crocodiles? - Raise your hand.

2445
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:01,099
- I went to Osaka, too. - Osaka.

2446
01:30:01,466 --> 01:30:02,734
How is this possible?

2447
01:30:03,034 --> 01:30:05,403
That group has the best members.

2448
01:30:05,403 --> 01:30:07,038
- This is... - Jae Seok.

2449
01:30:07,038 --> 01:30:08,373
You know,

2450
01:30:08,373 --> 01:30:11,175
you should have sent us after the first week.

2451
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:12,644
Why did you make us struggle for four weeks?

2452
01:30:12,644 --> 01:30:15,913
You made us harbor false hope.

2453
01:30:15,913 --> 01:30:18,650
We will leave as soon as your visas and the preparation for the shoot...

2454
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:19,851
are in order.

2455
01:30:20,118 --> 01:30:21,853
This is crazy.

2456
01:30:21,853 --> 01:30:23,054
May I bring my children with me?

2457
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:25,289
(May I bring my children with me?)

2458
01:30:25,289 --> 01:30:26,290
(I am sure my son, Dream, will like Switzerland.)

2459
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:28,259
- Who? - Your children?

2460
01:30:28,259 --> 01:30:29,594
Don't do that.

2461
01:30:29,594 --> 01:30:32,263
Look at Jae Seok's facial expression.

2462
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:37,001
If you want to bring your family with you...

2463
01:30:37,735 --> 01:30:38,803
To the ghost hotel?

2464
01:30:38,803 --> 01:30:41,039
Can my wife go on this trip instead?

2465
01:30:41,372 --> 01:30:42,840
- What? - She will like it.

2466
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,409
How will she wing walk?

2467
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:46,110
Can my wife go on this trip instead?

2468
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,545
- He is ridiculous. - My wife will go in my place.

2469
01:30:47,545 --> 01:30:48,746
Yes Man.

2470
01:30:48,746 --> 01:30:51,082
My dad likes these kinds of trips.

2471
01:30:51,082 --> 01:30:53,751
- I think my dad will like it, too. - It's a good opportunity.

2472
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:56,154
(The members for the two packages are decided.)

2473
01:30:56,354 --> 01:30:57,722
(Next week)

2474
01:30:58,022 --> 01:31:01,059
(The end of the war of TV rating notice)

2475
01:31:01,059 --> 01:31:02,760
(Only one scenario is chosen.)

2476
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,163
(Who is the winner of this war?)

2477
01:31:05,163 --> 01:31:07,065
(However)

2478
01:31:07,799 --> 01:31:10,768
(It's not over until it is.)

2479
01:31:10,768 --> 01:31:13,104
(What in the world is this?)

2480
01:31:13,104 --> 01:31:15,306
(There is an array of strange outfits.)

2481
01:31:15,306 --> 01:31:17,742
(Stay alert until the end to avoid becoming the sacrifice.)

2482
01:31:17,742 --> 01:31:21,345
(The most intense and the worst shoot for TV rating notice)

2483
01:31:22,113 --> 01:31:25,016
(Become either the sacrifice or the hero.)

2484
01:31:25,016 --> 01:31:27,518
(Who is the final winner of the TV rating notice war?)

2485
01:31:27,518 --> 01:31:30,388
(TV Rating Notice Final, Game of Thrones)
