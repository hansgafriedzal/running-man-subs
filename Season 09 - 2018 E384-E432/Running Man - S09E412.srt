1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,811
(Previously)

2
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:11,514
(Get Your Number Eights began.)

3
00:00:11,514 --> 00:00:14,584
(Will the winner be getting amazing benefits?)

4
00:00:14,584 --> 00:00:19,022
(The winner will be able to change the profile of every member.)

5
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:22,325
(For 8 long days, he will be able to change it however he wants to.)

6
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:27,264
(He could put a photo of grasshopper on Jae Seok's profile.)

7
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,633
(It's easy to become the winner.)

8
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:35,105
(The first 3 people who get the number 8 will go to the finals.)

9
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:38,942
(The final mission will determine the winner.)

10
00:00:38,942 --> 00:00:42,512
(Hoping to win, they came up with ideas for the profiles.)

11
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:47,317
(The members' competition gets out of hand.)

12
00:00:47,317 --> 00:00:52,689
(Which would be the most extraordinary idea?)

13
00:00:53,256 --> 00:00:56,860
I came up with a lot of ideas.

14
00:00:57,294 --> 00:01:00,063
(The board is packed.)

15
00:01:00,063 --> 00:01:03,233
Jong Kook is "Sulky"...

16
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:06,703
- and "Hong Jin Young's boyfriend". - What?

17
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:09,406
For the latter one, I will put a photo of Jin Young.

18
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,107
Jin Young... You should ask Jin Young for permission.

19
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:14,577
I will choose the photo of her doing this. "You!"

20
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,646
I plan to choose that photo.

21
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:18,248
He shouldn't win.

22
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:21,685
Kwang Soo will be "Beanpole".

23
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,920
- So... - I hate this even more.

24
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:27,023
I will put a photo of a really tall tree.

25
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,925
I will make that his profile picture.

26
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,728
And another one is "Stop, Song Joong Ki."

27
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,863
It means he's coming after him.

28
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:35,265
- It's his goal. - No matter what happens,

29
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,734
I will stop him from winning.

30
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:40,103
"The Accidental Detective 2: In Action" was successful.

31
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:41,738
That movie had three million audience mark.

32
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:44,541
- My gosh. - Dong Il and Sang Woo...

33
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,843
- brought in about 1.5 million each. - 1.5 million each.

34
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:48,511
- Right. - What about me?

35
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,513
(His fellow actors each brought in 1.5 million audience.)

36
00:01:50,513 --> 00:01:51,548
(What about me then?)

37
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,116
- Did I bring in zero viewers? - You did your best.

38
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:55,251
You promoted it.

39
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:56,753
- Okay. Fine. - Calm down.

40
00:01:56,753 --> 00:01:59,122
- But you did well for a cameo. - Right.

41
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,991
(Haha praises him.)

42
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,127
- You did really well. - You did well for a cameo.

43
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:05,128
Why was I a cameo?

44
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:07,263
The director was generous enough to give you a lot of parts.

45
00:02:07,263 --> 00:02:09,766
I grew my hair for a year just for that. Why am I a cameo?

46
00:02:09,766 --> 00:02:11,301
Stop it.

47
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:15,271
That's it for me.

48
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:18,475
Let's check mine.

49
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:21,244
- Haha is "Ha the Coward". - "Ha the Coward".

50
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,513
- Okay. Yes. - Do you accept it?

51
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:26,383
Kwang Soo is... He was "Asia's Prince" before.

52
00:02:26,383 --> 00:02:27,484
Are you done with Haha?

53
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,152
(Is he done with Haha?)

54
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,353
I am done with Haha. Why?

55
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:31,821
- It's boring. That's all. - Why?

56
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,623
(He's utterly honest.)

57
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,891
(Seok Jin hits him.)

58
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:35,992
(One attacks with facts and another physically attacks.)

59
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:37,494
- It's boring. - Just listen.

60
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:39,095
- It's just that it's too boring. - Is everything you do fun?

61
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:40,864
- There's no wit. - Is everything you do fun?

62
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:43,133
Jae Seok tilted his head.

63
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,001
If you say that, it will sound boring.

64
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,637
- We will listen some more. - Wait.

65
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:51,741
Kwang Soo was previously known as "Asia's Prince".

66
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,344
(Yawning)

67
00:02:54,344 --> 00:02:56,112
Now everyone thinks I am boring.

68
00:02:56,112 --> 00:02:58,114
He was previously known as "Asia's Prince".

69
00:02:58,114 --> 00:03:01,217
So Min is "Fart".

70
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:04,053
("Fart".)

71
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,221
Will you really do this?

72
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,424
- Will you not react? - But "Fart" is...

73
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:08,925
What is "Fart"?

74
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,393
- You have to react. - You...

75
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,061
You have to let us be able to react.

76
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,863
You have to work, you know?

77
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:16,533
- Let us be able to react. - All right.

78
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:19,335
Wait. There's something amazing coming up.

79
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,838
Wake me when that amazing thing comes up.

80
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:25,241
(He goes to sleep.)

81
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,477
Seok Jin is desperate.

82
00:03:27,544 --> 00:03:29,245
(He finishes presenting his ideas.)

83
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:33,683
(Who will be the winner that will actually get to use these ideas?)

84
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,985
- I want it. - I want it too.

85
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:39,622
All right. This is the 1st mission to win 8.

86
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:41,724
You have to find acquaintances that are related to eight.

87
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:43,526
- What? - That are related to eight?

88
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:44,561
Acquaintances?

89
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,595
(Acquaintances related to 8?)

90
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,664
- I don't have friends. - You will be given...

91
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:51,468
4 keywords. The 2 people who choose...

92
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,336
the same keyword will cast a guest who meet the requirements.

93
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:56,506
Then you will have a match against the guest.

94
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:57,774
The winning member will be given an eight.

95
00:03:57,774 --> 00:03:58,842
Really?

96
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:00,443
- 2 people will compete? - 2 people will compete?

97
00:04:00,443 --> 00:04:01,544
We will be competing.

98
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:03,513
It's really important whom you become a team with.

99
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:04,647
I have to win.

100
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:08,985
Before we begin the race, let's play Pick a Suitcase...

101
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:10,653
to win the 1st 8s.

102
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,722
- What? - The 1st 8s.

103
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:14,657
- They are offering the 1st 8s. - I need to start with them.

104
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:17,927
In these eight suitcases,

105
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:21,397
there are 1, 3, or 5 of them.

106
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:22,932
You can start with five of them from the start?

107
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:24,901
The person who picks the case with five will be the winner.

108
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,036
- He will surely win. - That's amazing.

109
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,438
I need to choose it.

110
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,874
(They laugh.)

111
00:04:30,874 --> 00:04:32,475
How can you with that unlucky hand of yours?

112
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:35,111
It amuses me that he manages to have such expectations.

113
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,847
I will pick it. Watch me.

114
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,682
- All right. - Let's go find the case with five.

115
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:40,683
(Who will be picking the case with 5 cards of number 8?)

116
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:41,784
Let's do this.

117
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,153
I will choose the last one remaining.

118
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,855
I can't trust my hands.

119
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,724
Let's change.

120
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:49,726
No. No. I am certain that this has five cards.

121
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,262
It's obvious. This has five cards.

122
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:53,963
- Yes. - You can't see it.

123
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,866
(Who will get 5 cards and who will get 1 card?)

124
00:04:57,767 --> 00:05:01,971
(As Jae Seok wished, he got 5 cards.)

125
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:05,542
(He tries to keep a poker face.)

126
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,811
(Who will be getting the other case with five cards?)

127
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:09,846
(It's Se Chan.)

128
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:11,114
I'm the winner.

129
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:12,715
Don't laugh.

130
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:15,552
If you get five cards, you will most likely win.

131
00:05:15,552 --> 00:05:18,354
(Kwang Soo gets...)

132
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:21,391
(1 card.)

133
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:23,626
Okay. Okay. Okay.

134
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,995
(He's flustered.)

135
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:28,398
(The other person who got as unlucky as Kwang Soo...)

136
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,133
(is Seok Jin.)

137
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,568
This is it.

138
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:34,170
(We have a feeling that today will be another bad day for him.)

139
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,072
(Jae Seok and Se Chan get 5 cards of number 8.)

140
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:37,473
(Jong Kook, So Min, Haha, and Ji Hyo get 3 cards.)

141
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:39,175
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin get 1 card.)

142
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,412
You will choose a keyword related to eight.

143
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:43,780
Choose one.

144
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:46,215
(The 2 people who choose the same keyword will form a team.)

145
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,617
All of them have different colors, right?

146
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:49,852
All right. Can we open these?

147
00:05:49,852 --> 00:05:51,087
Yes. Open and check them.

148
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:52,522
Whom would I go with?

149
00:05:52,522 --> 00:05:55,024
- I have a bad feeling. - What? "Celebrity born in August"?

150
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:56,125
My gosh.

151
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,393
(Is it you again?)

152
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:58,962
My gosh.

153
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,197
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin have to cast a celebrity born in August.)

154
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:03,032
I got the same one as Ji Hyo. "Celebrity who's won 8 awards".

155
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,334
You got "Celebrity who's won 8 awards"?

156
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:07,337
(Haha and Ji Hyo have to cast a celebrity who's won 8 awards.)

157
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,671
"Someone who's worked on a title with 'eight' in it."

158
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:11,641
There's no such work. Which movie or TV show has eight in the title?

159
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,743
(They have to cast someone who's worked on a title with 8 in it.)

160
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:16,646
"A celebrity with a perfectly proportioned body". Great.

161
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:18,781
But it's...

162
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,416
Okay, Se Chan!

163
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:21,884
(Why is it me again?)

164
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:25,021
Okay! Nice! I will be with Jong Kook today.

165
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:26,522
(They will cast a celebrity with a perfectly proportioned body.)

166
00:06:26,522 --> 00:06:29,125
- You're with me! - Yes! Jong Kook!

167
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,493
(They will now start casting the keyword-related guests.)

168
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,562
I am with Ji Hyo again!

169
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:33,997
(They will now start casting the keyword-related guests.)

170
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:35,932
(Each team's mission)

171
00:06:35,932 --> 00:06:39,636
Let's go.

172
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,037
I have to wear the belt.

173
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:42,071
(Jong Kook and Se Chan's awkward partnership begins.)

174
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,706
- Okay. - Yes, Jong Kook.

175
00:06:43,973 --> 00:06:45,041
("Yes, Jong Kook"?)

176
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,243
When I say "okay", you should say "okay" too.

177
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:48,378
Why would you say "Yes, Jong Kook"?

178
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:50,680
- It means it's great. - It lowers the energy.

179
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,483
- Okay. Okay. - Okay. Okay.

180
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,551
- Great. - Great.

181
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,552
(Jong Kook is happy again.)

182
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,621
- What do we do now? - What do we do?

183
00:06:58,621 --> 00:07:00,523
You need to start casting people.

184
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:02,325
- Is that right? - Someone with a perfect body.

185
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,227
- Wait. - Okay.

186
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:05,762
(Let's see who's there.)

187
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,497
- Perfectly proportioned body? - Wouldn't...

188
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:10,233
Wouldn't they be models or actors?

189
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:11,467
(He thinks carefully.)

190
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,403
Should I give Bo Gum a call?

191
00:07:13,403 --> 00:07:15,405
(He thinks of calling Bo Gum.)

192
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:17,006
- Bo Gum? - Really?

193
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,508
He certainly has a perfectly proportioned body.

194
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,543
Bo Gum has a perfectly proportioned body.

195
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:23,946
(He calls Bo Gum.)

196
00:07:23,946 --> 00:07:28,217
- Hello? - Bo Gum.

197
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:31,220
- Yes, hello. - Have you been well?

198
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,955
Are you well?

199
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:35,091
Yes. I am doing well.

200
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,395
Bo Gum, actually, we are shooting Running Man.

201
00:07:39,395 --> 00:07:41,731
Don't walk. Run. Running Man.

202
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:42,932
(He's too excited to talk to Bo Gum.)

203
00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:45,134
You know Yang Se Chan, right? He's right next to me.

204
00:07:45,134 --> 00:07:47,036
Hello. I am Yang Se Chan.

205
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:49,672
- Hello. - I am your big fan, Bo Gum.

206
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:51,541
- Bo Gum. - I am your fan too.

207
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,978
Yes. We have to find a celebrity with a perfectly proportioned body.

208
00:07:56,913 --> 00:08:00,083
We are given a mission to complete.

209
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:03,086
Your face to body ratio is about 1 to 8, right? Is it 1 to 9?

210
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,521
No, it's not 1 to 8.

211
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:07,323
- What's wrong with you? - Come on.

212
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,492
Don't be humble.

213
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:12,762
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

214
00:08:12,762 --> 00:08:14,731
(Will Bo Gum be willing to join them?)

215
00:08:14,731 --> 00:08:19,102
(What are you doing right now, Bo Gum?)

216
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:20,636
I am on the way to the office.

217
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,572
- To the office? You are good. - Right.

218
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,273
Why are you going to the office? For work?

219
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:26,542
I have a meeting today.

220
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:28,144
- I see. - Meeting is good.

221
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:31,047
Have the meeting then.

222
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,750
Thank you for answering my call.

223
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,585
- No problem. - Always...

224
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:37,887
The weather is really hot. Take care of yourself.

225
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,555
You are so good.

226
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:42,425
- You are such a good man. - Take care of your health.

227
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:44,927
- I will call you again. - Thank you.

228
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,029
By the way, your face to body radio is 1 to 9.

229
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:50,166
- Thank you. - Bye.

230
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:53,503
Thank you, Jong Kook.

231
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,972
You mostly asked all the questions,

232
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:59,242
and Bo Gum gave short answers. So I only heard your voice.

233
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,410
I wanted to hear his voice.

234
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,513
- Hey. - It's just that it's a shame.

235
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,014
You kept talking.

236
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:06,315
- Whose fan are you? - I wanted to hear his voice.

237
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,151
- Whose fan are you? - I am your fan.

238
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:10,353
- How dare you say that? - You are my fan, and yet...

239
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:12,722
- You talked t0o much. - You are the president of...

240
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:15,057
Kim Jong Kook celebrity fan club.

241
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:16,826
- Am I the president? - You are.

242
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:19,061
- Really? - Yes, act like one.

243
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:20,963
I do, but I just wanted to hear Bo Gum's voice.

244
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:22,665
He's been on many dramas.

245
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,934
Right. But still...

246
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:26,936
- It would've been great if he came. - We're not that close.

247
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:29,405
- All right. Let's call this guy. - Okay.

248
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,174
- It's Loco. - Loco?

249
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:32,542
- Yes. - "Above Live"?

250
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,343
- Yes, Loco. - Goodness, Loco.

251
00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:36,112
- The phone is turned off. - His phone is turned off.

252
00:09:36,112 --> 00:09:38,614
- He must've had too much to drink. - He's probably sleeping now.

253
00:09:38,981 --> 00:09:40,983
Should I give Dong Wook a call?

254
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:42,585
Yes, let's call him.

255
00:09:42,852 --> 00:09:46,422
- He's favorable toward our show. - That's right.

256
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:50,393
(Calling Dong Wook)

257
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,195
Gosh, I can't reach him.

258
00:09:52,562 --> 00:09:54,330
That leaves us no choice, Jong Kook.

259
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:56,666
Jong Kook, we have no choice. I'll just call this person.

260
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,733
- Who is it? - It's...

261
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:59,836
It's our secret weapon. I'll call now.

262
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:03,372
(Who is Jong Kook and Se Chan's secret weapon?)

263
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,842
A lot of celebrities were born in August.

264
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:07,343
Yes.

265
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:09,745
- Eun Ji was born in August. - Se Hyeong was born in August.

266
00:10:09,745 --> 00:10:11,280
- Se Hyeong? - Yes, Yang Se Hyeong.

267
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:13,516
- Goodness. - Whom should we call?

268
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,685
Hold on. Let me see who else was born in August.

269
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,854
- Gosh. - What should we do...

270
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:20,923
Oh, right. Shin Hae Sun. She was born in August too.

271
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:22,992
(The most sought-after actress, Hae Sun, was born in August?)

272
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,227
- Who? - Shin Hae Sun.

273
00:10:24,227 --> 00:10:25,928
- She was in "My Golden Life". - Yes, I know her.

274
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,064
Actually, Hae Sun...

275
00:10:28,064 --> 00:10:29,632
It's a bit uncomfortable to mention this on here, but...

276
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,367
- "Happy Together" made her popular. - Hey.

277
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,202
You're talking nonsense.

278
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,037
- Her drama made her popular. - You're talking crazy.

279
00:10:35,037 --> 00:10:37,473
- She's the fruit of the program. - Gosh, you're unbelievable.

280
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:40,243
- You're full of yourself. - No, I'm not full of myself.

281
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:41,644
- Hey. - Listen to this guy.

282
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,846
Let's give her a call then even if she can't join us.

283
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:45,982
- Do you know her phone number? - Of course not.

284
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:48,851
- You don't even have her number. - I can call her agency.

285
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,354
Don't you know my name makes everything possible?

286
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:52,521
I have... What did you say?

287
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:54,991
- My name makes everything possible. - Makes what possible?

288
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,292
- Should I call her then? - Call my house.

289
00:10:56,292 --> 00:10:58,127
If it's you on the phone, they won't put you through.

290
00:10:58,361 --> 00:11:00,363
- Hey, I'm talking business here. - Say that...

291
00:11:00,363 --> 00:11:02,965
- Say that it's you, it won't work. - I'm talking about this show.

292
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:05,234
- What are you talking about? - Why not?

293
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,904
I have Hae Sun's phone number.

294
00:11:07,904 --> 00:11:10,506
If you have her number, I'll buy you lunch for the rest of my life.

295
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:11,741
Forever.

296
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:12,942
- Look. - Only if you have her number.

297
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:15,945
(Does he really have her number? He's calling someone.)

298
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,446
- Hello? - Hello.

299
00:11:17,446 --> 00:11:18,681
Hae Sun!

300
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:21,117
- Hello? - Hey, Hae Sun!

301
00:11:21,117 --> 00:11:22,184
"Hey, Hae Sun"?

302
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:23,653
- Don't be so casual. - Hello.

303
00:11:23,653 --> 00:11:25,621
- Goodness, hey, you. - Don't be so casual with her.

304
00:11:25,621 --> 00:11:27,523
- Hae Sun. - He has lost it.

305
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:31,193
- It's great that you're doing well. - Thank you.

306
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,995
- It's her? - Of course. Ask her.

307
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,664
Hello.

308
00:11:34,664 --> 00:11:38,167
- Hi. Hello. - I'm Jee Seok Jin.

309
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:40,202
- Oh, hello. - See? Did you hear that?

310
00:11:40,202 --> 00:11:41,671
Her voice pitch got lower.

311
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:43,906
- Hae Sun. - Do you know Jae Seok?

312
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:46,676
- Of course. - What did I tell you?

313
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:49,011
Isn't your birthday in August?

314
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:51,681
- Yes, it is. - On what day is it?

315
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,015
It's August 31.

316
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:55,451
- Goodness. - Goodness. It's the last day.

317
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,886
It's the last day of August.

318
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:58,254
- Gosh. - It's the last day.

319
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:01,557
- I'm sorry to call so suddenly. - Yes?

320
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:05,795
We must meet with a celebrity who was born in August and do a mission.

321
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,063
I see.

322
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,764
Are you free right now?

323
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,935
Yes, I'll be at SBS in Mok-dong for the entire day.

324
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,537
- Really? - That's great.

325
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:16,405
- Then can we meet for a second? - This is great.

326
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:21,177
(Please say yes, Hae Sun.)

327
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:22,945
- Yes, of course. - This is great news.

328
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:25,014
- We got her on our first try. - This is great.

329
00:12:25,014 --> 00:12:26,382
- Hae Sun. - Yes?

330
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:28,384
Can we head over there now?

331
00:12:28,384 --> 00:12:30,886
- Yes, yes. Please come. - Okay. I got it.

332
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:32,021
We'll be there soon.

333
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:34,423
- Sure. See you later. - Okay, see you soon.

334
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:35,891
Hae Sun.

335
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:37,026
Hey!

336
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,195
- I had a question for her. - Listen.

337
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,796
Hae Sun must be tired. She said her drama is premiering today.

338
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:42,131
You didn't let me talk to her.

339
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:43,833
Hae Sun is probably tired.

340
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,735
- I should've called her. - All right.

341
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,070
- You invited your guest. - Yes.

342
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:49,805
- I'll give you the hidden mission. - What is it?

343
00:12:49,805 --> 00:12:51,374
- What do we have to do? - This is important.

344
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:54,443
- I'll win no matter what. - The member who finishes...

345
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:59,281
the hidden mission first will be paired up with the guest.

346
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:00,783
Keep in mind that pairing up...

347
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:03,486
- is more advantageous. - Is that so?

348
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:06,022
Draw the hidden missions that you will carry out.

349
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:09,225
- Our missions are different. - I see.

350
00:13:09,225 --> 00:13:10,993
- You choose. - I'll choose this one.

351
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:12,261
(What kind of missions will they do?)

352
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,431
- Should we keep this a secret? - It's better to keep it a secret.

353
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:19,335
Gosh, how am I supposed to do this?

354
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:22,505
Mine is impossible to complete. You won.

355
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:25,541
This is impossible. How... How could...

356
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:28,177
- Gosh, unbelievable. - She must say you're full of life.

357
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:30,546
(She must say that you're full of life.)

358
00:13:31,213 --> 00:13:32,782
(No way. How did he figure that out?)

359
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:33,783
How did you know?

360
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:36,252
It was reflected over there. You must've been more careful.

361
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:37,353
- You could see that? - It was reflected.

362
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:39,021
- I can see that. - Gosh, yes, you can see that.

363
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,023
I can see through it because the paper is very thin.

364
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,426
- She must say you're full of life. - You have good eyes.

365
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,794
Goodness.

366
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:46,595
I have to act like I'm full of life.

367
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:48,864
Dear me. This is crazy.

368
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:54,637
You must invite a guest whose project's title has number eight in.

369
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,872
- That's hard. Number eight? - It's hard.

370
00:13:56,872 --> 00:13:58,407
The mission is hard, and teaming up with her is hard too.

371
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,342
- Me too. - Today won't be easy for me.

372
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,545
It's a hardship after a hardship. He's the biggest hardship.

373
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,480
He's as big as Mount Paektu.

374
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:07,817
I just thought of this one. "Christmas in August".

375
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:09,952
- Han Seok Kyu and Shim Eun Ha. - Shim Eun Ha.

376
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:11,387
(The main leads of the best romantic movie?)

377
00:14:11,387 --> 00:14:12,421
- Do you know their numbers? - No.

378
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:13,722
(The main leads of the best romantic movie?)

379
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,757
I do want to meet them though.

380
00:14:14,757 --> 00:14:16,792
- It'd be awesome if they joined. - It's my wish. Exactly.

381
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,161
The staff can really compliment us for our job this time.

382
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,362
Right?

383
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:21,363
- Do you know them? - We...

384
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,033
We might even win the Grand Award.

385
00:14:24,033 --> 00:14:27,002
(Grand... Grand Award?)

386
00:14:27,002 --> 00:14:29,905
But are there other films or dramas with number eight?

387
00:14:30,005 --> 00:14:32,241
- Number eight. - She would be the biggest guest.

388
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,242
Who is she?

389
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:36,645
- Anne Hathaway in "Ocean's Eight". - That's amazing. That one counts.

390
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:37,713
Do you know her number?

391
00:14:37,713 --> 00:14:38,881
(Can they invite her and win the Grand Award?)

392
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,216
Direct message her.

393
00:14:40,883 --> 00:14:41,884
Direct message?

394
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:43,552
(Should I really try that?)

395
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:45,221
- Who? - "Reply" series.

396
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,455
- The drama. - "Reply..."

397
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,592
- "1988". - "88". "1988". In the drama...

398
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:51,794
Ryu Jun Yeol, Ko Kyoung Pyo,

399
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,796
- Bo Gum, Ahn Jae Hong, - Kyoung Pyo is in the army.

400
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:55,364
And Lee Dong Hwi...

401
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:58,267
- Jeon Mi Seon. - Park Jung Min was in it.

402
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,703
Jung Min made a special appearance before.

403
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:02,004
But I can't.

404
00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,706
I can't call him out anymore.

405
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:06,175
For the show, he rode his motorcycle from Seongnam.

406
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,177
I saw that show. Wasn't that show...

407
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:11,280
He wasn't on the show. How could you have seen it?

408
00:15:11,914 --> 00:15:13,883
(It only took Kwang Soo's phone call.)

409
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,285
(Jung Min is a loyal actor friend who came all the way to Gangnam.)

410
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,453
(Thank you.)

411
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:18,821
- Hello. - You rode the motorcycle here?

412
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,524
I didn't recognize you for a second.

413
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:24,126
(However, he didn't get much airtime after he made his appearance.)

414
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:25,561
Jung Min.

415
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,163
(You know how I feel, right?)

416
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,398
Can you come here for a second?

417
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,967
- Should I give him a call? - Yes, call him.

418
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,202
- Call him. - I feel sorry to even call him.

419
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:34,837
Just call him. See what he's up to now.

420
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:37,206
(He musters up his courage...)

421
00:15:37,206 --> 00:15:38,474
I don't think he'll answer it.

422
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,742
(He cautiously calls Jung Min.)

423
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,344
He said he'd give Kwang Soo his number. Or was it a wrong one?

424
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:44,446
- Hey, Kwang Soo. - Jung Min.

425
00:15:44,613 --> 00:15:46,415
- Yes? - Are you sleeping?

426
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:48,517
Yes, I was sleeping.

427
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:50,286
Jung Min.

428
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,056
I'm sorry. This is for Running Man again.

429
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:56,325
(Sighing)

430
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:59,195
What is it again this time? They'll edit me out again.

431
00:15:59,195 --> 00:16:00,396
I'm really sorry.

432
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:03,232
(What is it again this time? They'll edit me out again.)

433
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,000
No, they won't. Jung Min!

434
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,869
I won't let this slide.

435
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:09,772
- He came all the way from Seongnam. - Exactly.

436
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:12,141
Jung Min, I'm sorry. You won't be edited out.

437
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:13,842
- Jung Min. - He's hurt. He's hurt.

438
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:16,245
I'm not joining you today.

439
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,781
(You probably won't want to, right?)

440
00:16:18,781 --> 00:16:20,583
- Okay, get some more sleep. - I'm sorry.

441
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,585
- Bye. - Have a good day.

442
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:24,687
I'm sorry, Jung Min.

443
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:25,854
(I like you very much.)

444
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:26,956
Good luck with "Sunset in My Hometown"!

445
00:16:26,956 --> 00:16:28,757
(I'll be more famous and invite you then.)

446
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,726
Whom else can we call?

447
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,561
Sung Dong Il was in the drama too.

448
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,997
- Right. He was in the drama too. - Yes, he was in it.

449
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:37,233
If it's not too much to ask, why don't we invite him?

450
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,035
But Dong Il lives in Incheon.

451
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:41,637
It is quite far.

452
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:43,439
He lives in Incheon.

453
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:44,873
We can go to him.

454
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,875
(But should we still give him a call?)

455
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,344
I'm nervous.

456
00:16:48,344 --> 00:16:51,013
(Calling Dong Il)

457
00:16:51,013 --> 00:16:52,548
Would he know who I am?

458
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:55,184
Tell him we're wrapping up. Hey, what's up?

459
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:56,452
Hello, Dong Il.

460
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:57,553
What's up?

461
00:16:57,553 --> 00:17:00,689
- Hello, Mr. Sung. - We're filming Running Man now.

462
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:03,525
So?

463
00:17:03,592 --> 00:17:06,595
I'm Jeon So Min. Hello, Mr. Sung.

464
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,197
Oh, hello.

465
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,132
I'm a big fan.

466
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:11,900
I see. I'm a fan too.

467
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,003
Thank you. I think he knows who I am.

468
00:17:14,003 --> 00:17:15,571
- He might not. - Really?

469
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:16,705
Dong Il.

470
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:18,407
(Laughing vigorously)

471
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:19,975
- Dong Il. - What is it?

472
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:21,343
Where are you now?

473
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,579
I'm here and there. I'm in Korea.

474
00:17:24,713 --> 00:17:26,015
- This is crazy. - Gosh.

475
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,583
He must've had a few drinks last night.

476
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,151
- Dong Il. - Yes?

477
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:30,786
I'm in Seoul.

478
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:32,655
- You're in Seoul? - He's in Seoul.

479
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:35,324
I have a shoot and other stuff.

480
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,893
- If you have some time to spare, - If you can...

481
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,095
- can we meet up? - Yes, just this once.

482
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,197
Why would we meet up? And you out of all people?

483
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,601
- Give him a call time to time. - You never call me.

484
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,236
Dong Il is a busy guy.

485
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:49,705
Do you have a bit of time?

486
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:51,874
I was wondering if we could meet for a few minutes.

487
00:17:51,874 --> 00:17:53,075
Where do I have to go?

488
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:54,443
(He sounds like a cool guy.)

489
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,911
(This is awesome. He might meet with us.)

490
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,446
Are you in Gangnam?

491
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:59,415
Yes, I'm in Gangnam.

492
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,083
We're in Gangnam too.

493
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,786
- Then Dong Il... - I'm in Yeoksam-dong.

494
00:18:03,786 --> 00:18:05,187
- Are we in Yeoksam-dong? - I see.

495
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:06,221
(They'll meet at this cafe.)

496
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,724
Dong Il, I will text you the address.

497
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,526
- It won't be long, right? - Yes, yes.

498
00:18:10,526 --> 00:18:11,794
If it's long, I'll leave.

499
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:13,762
- Yes, I know that very well. - It will be short.

500
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:15,731
- Okay. - Thank you, Dong Il.

501
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:17,933
- Sure. - Thank you.

502
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:20,569
(This is awesome! They've invited Sung Dong Il.)

503
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,238
(20 minutes later)

504
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:27,309
- Hello. - Gosh. Hello.

505
00:18:27,476 --> 00:18:30,412
(At last, he has shown himself.)

506
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:33,882
(He's the national treasure, Actor Sung Dong Il.)

507
00:18:33,882 --> 00:18:35,084
Hello.

508
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:37,252
- Let me use the restroom. - Sure.

509
00:18:37,252 --> 00:18:39,955
(He freely goes to the restroom as soon as he arrives.)

510
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:41,623
That's... That's the women's restroom.

511
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,258
Dong Il, it's on the right side.

512
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:48,497
(They're restless.)

513
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:50,833
He's... He's free-spirited by nature.

514
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,568
He's like a bohemian.

515
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:55,137
Why are you waiting out here?

516
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:57,206
Hello, Mr. Sung.

517
00:18:57,206 --> 00:18:58,741
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

518
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:00,376
- Let me wash my hands first. - Sure, sure.

519
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:04,246
(This bohemian is very hygienic.)

520
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:05,748
There's no tissue.

521
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,349
(Wiping)

522
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,452
(It seems he's close with the cameo of his movie, Kwang Soo.)

523
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:11,653
- Hello. - Hey.

524
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,622
- I had to wash my hands. - Hello. Thank you.

525
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:14,857
So Min is...

526
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:16,592
- a big fan of yours. - I'm a big fan.

527
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,694
- I looked you up on the way here. - Thank you.

528
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:22,364
- He didn't know who I was earlier. - No, no.

529
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,733
A long time ago,

530
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:27,002
he appeared when "The Accidental Detective 1" was released.

531
00:19:27,002 --> 00:19:28,203
It's been a while.

532
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,271
- That's right. - With Kwon Sang Woo.

533
00:19:29,271 --> 00:19:30,806
Yes.

534
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:33,709
- Let's put a microphone on you. - You haven't?

535
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:38,680
(The staff gets him ready.)

536
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,482
Is coffee okay? Or do you want juice?

537
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:41,683
- Coffee... - Well...

538
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:45,087
I'd love some morning coffee.

539
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,856
(Dong Il is so funny.)

540
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:50,459
Don't forget your microphone. I have a dozen at home.

541
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:52,795
He just leaves with the microphone still on.

542
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,163
He's like that.

543
00:19:54,163 --> 00:19:57,466
(Dong Il seems at home. What will his team's mission be?)

544
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,001
I think we're here.

545
00:19:59,001 --> 00:20:00,035
(Meanwhile, Haha and Ji Hyo...)

546
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:01,670
So many people work here.

547
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:02,905
Hello.

548
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:07,176
(This is where we're supposed to meet our guest.)

549
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:11,747
(Who is the 8-time winner guest?)

550
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,549
- Hello. - Hello.

551
00:20:16,485 --> 00:20:19,421
(Mamamoo)

552
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:23,759
(Summer 2018, their new song, "Egoistic", tops the charts.)

553
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,195
(In 2016,)

554
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,231
(with "You're the Best", they topped the charts 8 times.)

555
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:30,532
- Hello. - Hold on.

556
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,834
- Hello. - Hello.

557
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,936
They don't seem ready yet.

558
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,838
(Hold on.)

559
00:20:35,871 --> 00:20:37,573
- Hold on. - They're practicing.

560
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:39,741
Some of them seem ready.

561
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:41,477
(These don't seem ready.)

562
00:20:41,477 --> 00:20:43,111
But not everyone.

563
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:45,314
They were in a hurry.

564
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:47,115
Is it really okay?

565
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:48,484
- Can we come in? - Yes.

566
00:20:48,484 --> 00:20:49,751
Okay.

567
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:51,253
Mamamoo.

568
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:53,021
(Nice to see you.)

569
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,022
Hello.

570
00:20:54,022 --> 00:20:55,591
My goodness.

571
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:56,725
Nice to meet you.

572
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,126
Hi.

573
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:02,464
(The race starts.)

574
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:04,066
We found out something on our way here.

575
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:06,134
- What a coincidence. - Seriously.

576
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,136
- What is it? - Is it Hwasa's birthday today?

577
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:10,205
- That's right. - How did you know?

578
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:12,140
(It's Hwasa's 23rd birthday.)

579
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,141
How did you know?

580
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,610
So...

581
00:21:14,676 --> 00:21:17,412
- We were in a hurry. - we prepared a present.

582
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:18,547
Really...

583
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,116
- Are you serious? - That's why we're a bit late.

584
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:22,651
We wanted to celebrate together.

585
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:24,186
- Is this for real? - Hold on.

586
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,455
(Wait for the surprise gift.)

587
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:27,523
Really?

588
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:30,259
- For real? - Is it a cake?

589
00:21:30,526 --> 00:21:34,963
- Happy birthday, dear Hwasa - Happy birthday, dear Hwasa

590
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:38,433
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

591
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:40,469
A gopchang cake!

592
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,906
(A gopchang cake)

593
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,574
It looks tasty. I love it.

594
00:21:45,574 --> 00:21:48,410
- We made it. - Really?

595
00:21:48,744 --> 00:21:51,146
- Ji Hyo and I made it. - It's incredible.

596
00:21:51,146 --> 00:21:53,315
(This is how this gopchang cake was made.)

597
00:21:53,482 --> 00:21:56,251
(They picked hidden missions after contacting Mamamoo.)

598
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:59,821
(They had to make all 4 members do the mission.)

599
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:04,126
(Make the guests feed you.)

600
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:07,195
They might think I'm crazy.

601
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:09,865
It's Hwasa's birthday today.

602
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,500
- Really? - Really?

603
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:13,502
- It's Hwasa's birthday? - It's Hwasa's birthday?

604
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,803
(It's Hwasa's birthday today?)

605
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:15,971
Is it July 23 today?

606
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,606
- It is. - It is.

607
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,641
- Oh, my. - It's her birthday.

608
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:22,411
- We should bring a cake. - What about this?

609
00:22:22,411 --> 00:22:23,812
Why don't we make a gopchang cake?

610
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,447
(Why don't we make a gopchang cake?)

611
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:27,382
If we don't cut it...

612
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,484
We could just roll it and stick candles in it.

613
00:22:30,152 --> 00:22:31,520
It'll be amazing.

614
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,055
(Does it make sense?)

615
00:22:33,055 --> 00:22:34,523
She'll love it, right?

616
00:22:34,523 --> 00:22:36,425
(Does it make sense?)

617
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:39,328
Like this. It's working.

618
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:41,697
(Gopchang turns into a cake.)

619
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,165
It's working.

620
00:22:43,966 --> 00:22:45,934
Yes. Like that.

621
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,302
That looks great.

622
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:48,503
(They made the world's first gopchang cake.)

623
00:22:48,503 --> 00:22:50,272
It should look neat.

624
00:22:50,272 --> 00:22:51,473
(It looks perfect.)

625
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,976
- Happy birthday, Hwasa. - Happy birthday.

626
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:56,278
(A gopchang cake for Hwasa)

627
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:58,614
(I've never received a birthday cake like this.)

628
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:00,315
We made it ourselves.

629
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:02,250
How did you get gopchang?

630
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,785
- We went to a restaurant. - We went to one.

631
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:05,153
- It's touching, right? - Yes.

632
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:06,121
Let me try it.

633
00:23:06,121 --> 00:23:07,222
(She takes a bite right away.)

634
00:23:07,222 --> 00:23:08,690
You're eating it already?

635
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,125
(Shocked)

636
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:13,161
(This is Hwasa style.)

637
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:14,363
It looks tasty.

638
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,464
(Their mouths water.)

639
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:16,732
It looks tasty.

640
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,333
She makes it look so tasty.

641
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,401
(We want some too.)

642
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:20,502
All right.

643
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:22,371
(Well...)

644
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:24,806
We knew this would happen.

645
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:26,575
(Haha prepared something to accomplish his mission.)

646
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:29,344
- Did you prepare scissors? - We cut some up.

647
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,013
(You're so thoughtful.)

648
00:23:31,013 --> 00:23:32,180
Can we eat it now?

649
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,548
Of course.

650
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,083
- Happy birthday, Hwasa. - Take good care of yourself.

651
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,585
Thank you.

652
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:38,086
Like this...

653
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:39,121
(Give me some too.)

654
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:40,555
It's warm.

655
00:23:40,555 --> 00:23:41,857
It tastes good.

656
00:23:41,857 --> 00:23:43,191
- Try some. - Does it taste good?

657
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:45,961
(The way Hwasa eats gopchang made it sell like hotcakes.)

658
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:47,596
- Does it taste good? - Yes.

659
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:51,333
(They have no idea what Haha's plan is.)

660
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,534
- It tastes so good. - It tastes good, right?

661
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:53,935
Is there an age limit?

662
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,837
Our concert is...

663
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:58,740
That's big.

664
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:01,977
(She's enjoying it.)

665
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,913
Your hair looks like gopchang.

666
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:07,516
(Your hair looks like gopchang.)

667
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:08,984
It's ready to eat.

668
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:11,319
(Reggae gopchang style)

669
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,424
- Right? - Do the onions taste good?

670
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:17,025
Yes. Try some.

671
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,361
I don't eat onions.

672
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,462
- You don't? - Try some.

673
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:22,364
I like them.

674
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:24,966
(Give me some. I feel dizzy.)

675
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:26,735
- It's okay. - It tastes so good.

676
00:24:27,803 --> 00:24:31,506
(Hold on.)

677
00:24:32,174 --> 00:24:36,044
(While making the cake, )

678
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:39,014
(he only ate gopchang.)

679
00:24:39,014 --> 00:24:40,182
I like them.

680
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,883
(Why is he asking for onions?)

681
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,318
What?

682
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,087
- It's okay. - It tastes so good.

683
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:46,154
(He must be trying to complete his mission.)

684
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:48,056
- You don't like gopchang? - What?

685
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:50,025
- Why do you only eat onions? - Oh, my. Moon Byul...

686
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:52,260
I like gopchang too.

687
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,261
- Is there some? - Try it.

688
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:54,396
- Yes. Try it. - Try some gopchang.

689
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:55,797
Why aren't you eating any?

690
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,866
I want you to feed me.

691
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,902
(He tries to be cute.)

692
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:04,506
(Ji Hyo is now sure.)

693
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:05,974
There's no gopchang left.

694
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,410
It's okay for me.

695
00:25:08,443 --> 00:25:09,611
- I like onions. - Onions?

696
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:10,712
They look so tasty.

697
00:25:10,712 --> 00:25:12,114
The onions look so tasty.

698
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:14,516
(Ji Hyo intercepts the onions.)

699
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,051
(As Ji Hyo steals the onions, )

700
00:25:16,051 --> 00:25:17,652
(Haha's opportunity is gone.)

701
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,187
I love onions.

702
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:22,390
You must love onions.

703
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,127
- We do. - It tastes so good.

704
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,496
Is there more? I really like it.

705
00:25:27,496 --> 00:25:28,563
But...

706
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:34,402
(Haha's second try fails too.)

707
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:36,304
- All right. - The onions taste great.

708
00:25:36,304 --> 00:25:37,806
I love onions.

709
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:40,776
I can't believe it. I love mushrooms too.

710
00:25:40,776 --> 00:25:42,244
- Mushrooms? - Ji Hyo likes them too.

711
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:43,311
She likes them.

712
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,613
She must love them.

713
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:45,981
That's a lot.

714
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:48,049
Do you eat aluminum foil too?

715
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:49,251
Eat it.

716
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,920
What are you talking about?

717
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,089
What's with her?

718
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,491
- Why are you doing this? - I can't eat the foil.

719
00:25:56,491 --> 00:25:58,460
I'm just trying to have some fun.

720
00:25:58,493 --> 00:26:00,562
- Is this a mission? - No.

721
00:26:00,562 --> 00:26:02,397
It'd be too childish.

722
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:04,733
(Yes, we have a childish mission.)

723
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,101
It can't be...

724
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:08,403
It tastes so good.

725
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,105
Green onions?

726
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,908
- What's going on? - You brat.

727
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:14,676
I want to punch you.

728
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:17,012
(His mission fails, and he hates Ji Hyo.)

729
00:26:17,012 --> 00:26:18,213
I want to be friends with Hwi In.

730
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,381
It's mine.

731
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:20,582
(Ji Hyo ruins Haha's plan every time.)

732
00:26:20,582 --> 00:26:22,117
They have to eat more than the other?

733
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:23,351
It seems so.

734
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,486
(What should I do?)

735
00:26:24,486 --> 00:26:26,054
They have to get more food from us than the other?

736
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,656
Mamamoo is here.

737
00:26:27,656 --> 00:26:30,091
(He goes back to the beginning.)

738
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,226
The eight-time winner.

739
00:26:31,226 --> 00:26:32,694
The legend.

740
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,563
Mamamoo is here.

741
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:37,766
Why don't you teach us your dance moves?

742
00:26:37,766 --> 00:26:39,367
- So suddenly? - Yes.

743
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:42,771
Right now?

744
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,973
I want Hwasa...

745
00:26:44,973 --> 00:26:47,442
to teach Ji Hyo...

746
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,578
your dance moves.

747
00:26:49,644 --> 00:26:51,112
- Please stand up. - Me?

748
00:26:51,112 --> 00:26:52,681
Yes. Please stand here.

749
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:54,649
Something must be going on.

750
00:26:54,983 --> 00:26:56,351
Why...

751
00:26:56,351 --> 00:26:58,253
- Please stand here. - Something must be going on.

752
00:26:58,253 --> 00:26:59,654
Why...

753
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:03,124
You should put them down.

754
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:04,893
They might have a dance move where I can...

755
00:27:04,893 --> 00:27:06,061
use these.

756
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,496
- The balance dance. - Oh, okay.

757
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,131
(Haha fails to make Ji Hyo put down the food.)

758
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,233
Oh, that's right.

759
00:27:11,233 --> 00:27:13,034
We have the balance dance.

760
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:17,706
That's the worst dance move you have.

761
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:20,775
(He becomes restless and criticizes their dance moves.)

762
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:23,111
Put down the food.

763
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:26,581
Let's be more serious.

764
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,217
Oh, I have an idea.

765
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,386
(Ji Hyo suddenly has an idea.)

766
00:27:31,386 --> 00:27:33,788
I have a dance move...

767
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:36,224
- I want to recommend to Mamamoo. - Okay.

768
00:27:36,224 --> 00:27:37,592
- For their new song. - All right.

769
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:39,661
- Please do as I do. - Okay.

770
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:40,662
(Ji Hyo is usually a bad dancer.)

771
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,097
Like this?

772
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,865
- Like this? - Yes.

773
00:27:43,865 --> 00:27:45,433
And then...

774
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,402
a wave and...

775
00:27:47,402 --> 00:27:49,004
(Wink)

776
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,772
(Worried)

777
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:52,741
Let's do it all together.

778
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:54,643
Hold on. It's so old-fashioned.

779
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:57,612
(Hold on. It's so old-fashioned.)

780
00:27:57,612 --> 00:27:58,613
(He stops them.)

781
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,181
It'll make you all look so old-fashioned.

782
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,716
- Don't do it. - Stop it.

783
00:28:01,716 --> 00:28:03,652
Seriously. It's the bullet of love.

784
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,187
(Get out of my way.)

785
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,556
A wave and a wink.

786
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,824
Start.

787
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:13,161
(Singing)

788
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:15,664
(Haha tries to interrupt.)

789
00:28:15,664 --> 00:28:17,365
Wink.

790
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:19,501
(They wink too.)

791
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,936
All right.

792
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:22,103
Done.

793
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,571
Ji Hyo's mission is complete.

794
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:26,374
- Right? - Ji Hyo's mission is complete.

795
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,443
What was the mission?

796
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:29,978
(What was her mission?)

797
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:31,613
All right.

798
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:34,916
(Exchange winks with the guest.)

799
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,285
I had to make the guests wink at me.

800
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:39,754
(Ji Hyo took advantage of Haha's plan and succeeded.)

801
00:28:39,754 --> 00:28:41,456
I knew what your mission was.

802
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,425
You had to make them feed you, right?

803
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,494
(How did you know?)

804
00:28:48,096 --> 00:28:51,132
You can feed Haha now.

805
00:28:51,132 --> 00:28:52,334
(The mission is already over.)

806
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:54,035
He likes mushrooms and onions.

807
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,570
He likes green onions too.

808
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,505
- I like pork belly. - Give him everything at once.

809
00:28:58,006 --> 00:29:00,508
(Let us feed you.)

810
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:03,244
(This is our love for you, Haha, )

811
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:05,947
(who helped Ji Hyo win.)

812
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,816
Eat a lot.

813
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:10,452
- Everything at once. - He ate them all.

814
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:12,454
(Ji Hyo and Mamamoo become a team, )

815
00:29:12,454 --> 00:29:14,489
(and Haha will compete against them alone.)

816
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:16,691
We have to sit facing each other?

817
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:17,993
(Jong Kook and Se Chan are at a cafe in Sangam-dong.)

818
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,394
Facing each other?

819
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:21,863
I'm sitting with my fan club president.

820
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,431
I was your first fan club...

821
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,367
- president. - That's right.

822
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,936
(It's about time that she arrived.)

823
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:30,605
(I'll call the secret weapon.)

824
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:34,242
(He called the secret weapon to come.)

825
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:36,344
(Okay, I'll see you in Sangam-dong.)

826
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:39,647
(Who is Jong Kook and Se Chan's secret weapon?)

827
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:41,082
You're the president, so act like one.

828
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:42,417
(We're waiting for you.)

829
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:44,786
She's here.

830
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:46,855
- Is she here? - Where is she?

831
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,189
(Their secret weapon is here.)

832
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,026
(She obviously has long legs.)

833
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:53,928
(She arrives on her long legs.)

834
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:55,463
It was you.

835
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:56,931
(Who is their long-legged secret weapon?)

836
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:58,266
Goodness.

837
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:03,805
(A celebrity with long legs, Jang Do Yeon)

838
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,073
- Put on a microphone. - Goodness.

839
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:06,941
- Put on a microphone. - Do Yeon.

840
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:09,411
Aren't you too dressed up?

841
00:30:09,411 --> 00:30:11,112
- These are my pajamas. - Pajamas?

842
00:30:11,112 --> 00:30:13,415
I dressed up as an enka singer going to an event.

843
00:30:13,415 --> 00:30:14,783
(She dresses up as a Japanese singer.)

844
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:17,018
(Singing in Japanese)

845
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:20,055
- Put on a microphone, Do Yeon. - I see.

846
00:30:20,055 --> 00:30:22,323
- Your shoes look uncomfortable. - They're fine.

847
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,159
Put on comfortable ones.

848
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,861
- These are comfortable. - Come on and put these on.

849
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:29,431
- Do Yeon. - Put these on.

850
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:30,932
(Wait a minute.)

851
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,100
(That looks suspicious.)

852
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,302
- No, why are you... - Put on comfortable shoes.

853
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:35,904
Hey.

854
00:30:35,904 --> 00:30:37,539
(Their hidden missions were...)

855
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:40,108
(Time to select their hidden missions)

856
00:30:40,442 --> 00:30:43,578
(Change shoes with the guest.)

857
00:30:43,711 --> 00:30:45,213
(Will it be possible?)

858
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:47,415
(Make the guest hang onto your arm.)

859
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,451
(That's your mission, isn't it?)

860
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,552
These are more uncomfortable.

861
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:51,953
- Put these on. - What are you doing?

862
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:53,755
- What's going on? - That's not allowed.

863
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:55,824
- Why not? - You can't take her shoes.

864
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:58,159
- What's going on? - That's not allowed.

865
00:30:58,193 --> 00:30:59,961
It's because her feet hurt.

866
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,496
- My feet don't hurt. - Do Yeon.

867
00:31:01,496 --> 00:31:03,498
These are 280mm.

868
00:31:03,832 --> 00:31:06,901
- No, they aren't. - They're 280mm. They're too big.

869
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,603
- No. - You have such big feet.

870
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:11,773
- Do Yeon, you can't balance. - Do Yeon.

871
00:31:11,773 --> 00:31:14,175
Hold onto my arm.

872
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:16,111
(He's acting suspiciously.)

873
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,446
No, don't do it.

874
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:20,181
Just hang onto me.

875
00:31:20,181 --> 00:31:22,317
(He fails as her feet don't come off the floor.)

876
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,352
Don't your feet hurt?

877
00:31:24,352 --> 00:31:25,954
(Se Chan clears his mission.)

878
00:31:25,954 --> 00:31:27,722
Keep those shoes on.

879
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:28,990
(Okay, give me the other shoe.)

880
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,192
- Give me the other shoe. - No, stop it.

881
00:31:31,192 --> 00:31:34,262
You can't do this to a woman.

882
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:35,263
(He kicks away his shoe.)

883
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:37,031
- You can't do this... - Why did you kick it?

884
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,433
You can't do this to a woman.

885
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:40,602
- Are you advertising something? - Why did you kick it?

886
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,871
- You can't do this to a woman. - What are you doing?

887
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:44,672
- Keep my shoes on. - Hang onto my arm.

888
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,574
- Can you be so violent on SBS? - We're not.

889
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:49,410
- Come on, Do Yeon. - I can't wear them with bare feet.

890
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,312
- Stop. - What are you doing?

891
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,781
Go outside and fight. Why did you even invite me?

892
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:56,918
(What is going on with you two?)

893
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:58,953
- Jong Kook. - Do Yeon.

894
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:02,090
Hang onto my arm. You can't balance alone.

895
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,893
- Put these shoes on. - What are you doing to me?

896
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:06,961
- What are you doing to her? - It's done.

897
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:09,364
- Gosh. - Se Chan clears the mission.

898
00:32:09,364 --> 00:32:10,765
Okay.

899
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:13,201
- Was that his mission? - Did she have to hang onto you?

900
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:16,571
I'd feel bad to hang onto his arm even if he has big arms.

901
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,872
You tried to hang onto it.

902
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,674
- I'm sorry. - You almost did.

903
00:32:19,674 --> 00:32:22,243
I didn't think I'd have another chance.

904
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:23,611
May I leave?

905
00:32:23,611 --> 00:32:25,380
- No, we're starting now. - No.

906
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,381
(I'm sorry, but this is the start.)

907
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:28,216
No, we're starting now.

908
00:32:28,216 --> 00:32:30,552
Is this how you invite guests on Running Man?

909
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,553
(She's flustered.)

910
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:33,454
(I'm sorry, did we surprise you?)

911
00:32:33,454 --> 00:32:35,690
I guess things have changed quite a bit.

912
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,293
Usually, I'm invited by a writer on the show.

913
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,561
The members usually invite the guests.

914
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,863
- Is it like impromptu interviews? - Yes.

915
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,965
Guests come when they're available.

916
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:46,301
- It's real time. - Do Yeon.

917
00:32:46,301 --> 00:32:48,236
Your shoes are quite big.

918
00:32:48,236 --> 00:32:50,271
Even I fit in them. Is your size 280mm?

919
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:53,274
- No, it isn't. - My feet fit in your shoes.

920
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,076
- It's done. - What are you doing?

921
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:57,612
(Se Chan put on Do Yeon's shoes.)

922
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:00,882
(Do Yeon's feet didn't fit into Se Chan's shoes.)

923
00:33:00,882 --> 00:33:03,017
My feet fit into your shoes.

924
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:06,187
The size isn't written on it. That's annoying.

925
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:10,792
(Disappearance of big-footed Do Yeon's 280mm)

926
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,761
The first mission is Pinching Toes.

927
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,630
(Mission 1: Pinching Toes)

928
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,066
Three of you pinch each other with your toes.

929
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,001
The first to scream is eliminated.

930
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,603
- Okay. - It's a total of two rounds.

931
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,037
I'm not ticklish either.

932
00:33:23,471 --> 00:33:26,441
What if we can't pinch Jong Kook because he's muscular?

933
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:27,875
He's softer than you think.

934
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:31,246
You can choose which body part to pinch.

935
00:33:31,312 --> 00:33:33,715
- His nose? - "His nose"?

936
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:36,184
It's protruding the most. It's where I can pinch.

937
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:38,853
You can pinch anywhere that's allowed on TV.

938
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:40,722
Really? That's not fun.

939
00:33:40,722 --> 00:33:42,056
(Only what's allowed on TV?)

940
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,391
(She's very witty.)

941
00:33:43,391 --> 00:33:45,827
- I knew it. - What about his ear?

942
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:47,362
(They sit down, ready to pinch.)

943
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:49,364
Pull up your shorts more, Se Chan.

944
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,566
They won't go up higher. You'll tear them.

945
00:33:51,566 --> 00:33:54,602
Gosh, do celebrities even wear shorts like these anymore?

946
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:59,073
(Aren't these too tight for a celebrity?)

947
00:33:59,073 --> 00:34:00,575
That's embarrassing.

948
00:34:00,575 --> 00:34:02,010
- Jong Kook. - Do Yeon.

949
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,412
- That's embarrassing. - What has the stylist done?

950
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:08,249
Aren't these too short to wear?

951
00:34:08,883 --> 00:34:10,652
I wear them, Jong Kook.

952
00:34:10,652 --> 00:34:12,353
(He loses his temper.)

953
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,855
People wear them.

954
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:16,391
- Is that so? I'm sorry, Se Chan. - People do.

955
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:17,825
Get ready.

956
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,193
(They're about to start the game.)

957
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:20,862
(She wraps it around herself.)

958
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,064
You're wrapping it around you? I see.

959
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,433
Everything below his neck is metal.

960
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:27,302
(You must brace yourself.)

961
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:29,470
My toes won't pinch any part of his body.

962
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:32,206
Put your leg up and grab his hair.

963
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,675
Grab his hair.

964
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:35,677
Get ready.

965
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,011
Start.

966
00:34:37,011 --> 00:34:38,346
(Jong Kook and Se Chan pinch each other's thighs.)

967
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:40,915
(Round 1 starts.)

968
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:44,018
(She pulls his hair.)

969
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:46,321
(He feels pain on his scalp.)

970
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:48,423
(He transfers the pain to Se Chan's thigh.)

971
00:34:48,423 --> 00:34:50,425
(Screaming)

972
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:53,294
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

973
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:55,496
(That hurts.)

974
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:58,833
- What's wrong? - This game is for Jong Kook.

975
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,035
How could he pinch me like this with his toes?

976
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:03,604
- Let me see. - He practically slapped me.

977
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:06,274
- It's bruised. - Did it hurt?

978
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:08,076
- Of course it did. - Really?

979
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:10,545
- Of course it did. - He's so strong.

980
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,313
- Are you okay? - Okay.

981
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:15,116
(After being pinched by metal toes, Se Chan is eliminated.)

982
00:35:15,283 --> 00:35:18,386
- Next up are Jong Kook and Do Yeon. - Okay.

983
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:21,322
- Get started. - I can't win by strength.

984
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:23,958
Jong Kook is too strong, so I should pick...

985
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,060
- Pick what? Wait. - a stimulating body part.

986
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,862
(I'll pick a stimulating body part.)

987
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,163
Pick a sensitive part.

988
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:31,265
- Sensitive part. Shall we start? - Yes.

989
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:35,970
(The part that Do Yeon attacks is...)

990
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,606
(his ear.)

991
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,475
Put your big toe in his ear.

992
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,343
- Inside his ear? - Yes.

993
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,612
Push it right in.

994
00:35:44,612 --> 00:35:47,315
That's a good place. They're ready.

995
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,183
- He loses if he makes a sound. - That's right.

996
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,185
- Get ready, set. - Hold it for a minute.

997
00:35:51,185 --> 00:35:52,420
(Round 2 starts.)

998
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,755
(Laughing)

999
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,156
It's over.

1000
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:58,893
It's over. He made a sound.

1001
00:35:58,893 --> 00:36:02,597
Instead of pinching my ear, she was picking at it.

1002
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:06,601
(Do Yeon makes a deep attack that's only possible with her long toe.)

1003
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,737
Your toes are like fingers.

1004
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:12,740
- Good job. - Your toes are like fingers.

1005
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,942
It's because her feet are big.

1006
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:16,711
- It went right in. - It's because they're 300mm.

1007
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:18,913
- My earwax was picked. - That's okay.

1008
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:20,515
- Is it okay? - It's okay between celebrities.

1009
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:22,250
- Really? - The score is 1 to 1.

1010
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,551
Okay!

1011
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,086
(The scores are tied.)

1012
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,255
Let's move onto the last game.

1013
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:32,326
- Last mission is called Toe Zero. - "Toe Zero"?

1014
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,462
When the offense calls out a number...

1015
00:36:34,462 --> 00:36:37,432
and equals the number of toes, the offense wins.

1016
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:39,233
The team wins a point.

1017
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:42,603
The losing team gets a hit on the head.

1018
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:44,772
(The losing team gets a hit on the head.)

1019
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,107
"A hit on the head"?

1020
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,010
The 1st team to win 2 points wins.

1021
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,411
(The 1st to get 2 points wins.)

1022
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:52,713
- I know what it is. - That's a penalty.

1023
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:53,881
What do you think, Jong Kook?

1024
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:56,617
Do Yeon's feet seem as big as mine.

1025
00:36:56,684 --> 00:36:58,286
Stop it!

1026
00:36:58,286 --> 00:36:59,554
(Stop talking about my feet.)

1027
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:01,422
I couldn't help but notice. I'm sorry.

1028
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:03,491
- She's our guest. - Goodness.

1029
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:05,893
Should I throw them out?

1030
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:08,563
You should invite Lee Bong Geol instead.

1031
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:10,364
(He's a wrestler with big feet.)

1032
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:12,333
If you want to make fun of people.

1033
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,402
(Order of attack: Do Yeon, Jong Kook, Se Chan.)

1034
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:17,071
The number is from 1 to 6. Is there 0?

1035
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:18,172
There is.

1036
00:37:18,172 --> 00:37:19,474
(Do Yeon starts.)

1037
00:37:19,474 --> 00:37:20,908
Okay.

1038
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:22,743
Four.

1039
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,745
(She calls out 4.)

1040
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:29,817
(Do Yeon fails as the number of toes is 5.)

1041
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,619
It's five.

1042
00:37:31,953 --> 00:37:33,054
Next.

1043
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:34,355
(I will do better next time.)

1044
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:35,590
Zero.

1045
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,924
Okay.

1046
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:39,594
(He looks at others carefully.)

1047
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:42,463
(He takes a chance and calls out zero.)

1048
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:43,865
- Wait a minute. - What?

1049
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,700
- Didn't he say it too early? - No way.

1050
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,603
I called out the number when we calmed down.

1051
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:52,039
I waited in case someone complains.

1052
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:55,610
- You'll be penalized. - Get ready, Do Yeon.

1053
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,111
- Come here. - It's one of us.

1054
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:58,312
Only one of us gets hit.

1055
00:37:58,312 --> 00:38:00,515
He's a bully.

1056
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,083
- "A bully"? - I can't hit well...

1057
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,352
because I hurt my right hand.

1058
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:05,953
- You make people bleed with it. - No, I don't.

1059
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:06,954
(He's very scared.)

1060
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,322
(They don't bleed.)

1061
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:10,391
- You can make others bleed. - My right hand...

1062
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,593
- hurts right now. - Please start.

1063
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:13,594
(He picks his slightly injured right hand.)

1064
00:38:13,594 --> 00:38:14,929
I'll use this hand.

1065
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:16,864
I'll get hit next time.

1066
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:19,534
- Like this. - Don't hit my eyes.

1067
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,335
I'll hit right here.

1068
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:25,773
(It's a hitting contest between a fan club president and an artist.)

1069
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,408
(The sound is powerful.)

1070
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:30,678
(He hits him with love.)

1071
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,413
(It's a thrilling physical contact.)

1072
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:34,682
- You didn't punch me, right? - Se Chan.

1073
00:38:34,682 --> 00:38:36,083
- One more. - Gosh, that was nice.

1074
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:38,152
- Who's next? It's your turn. - Let's go.

1075
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,388
Start.

1076
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:42,223
Zero.

1077
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:43,991
(The number of toes is 0.)

1078
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,860
- Okay. - Zero.

1079
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,563
(Do Yeon succeeds.)

1080
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,798
(Her attack is a success.)

1081
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:52,600
(Karma visits Jong Kook.)

1082
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,136
Jong Kook gets hit once, and the other team gets a point.

1083
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:56,404
It goes up to three points.

1084
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:58,172
How can I do it?

1085
00:38:58,172 --> 00:39:00,141
- Let's see. - How can I hit him?

1086
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:02,843
- He has such a smooth forehead. - And I'm the president.

1087
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:04,245
Are you okay with this?

1088
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:06,614
(The sound is once again powerful.)

1089
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:09,684
- Gosh, your forehead is dented. - Okay.

1090
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:12,053
(Gosh, your forehead is dented.)

1091
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,521
- It's okay. - It's just a game.

1092
00:39:13,521 --> 00:39:14,889
It's just a game.

1093
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:18,960
- It's only a game. - Of course. I know.

1094
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,394
(It's Do Yeon's turn again.)

1095
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,764
- Zero. - I'm safe.

1096
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:25,866
(Do Yeon's attack fails.)

1097
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,501
I've been waiting.

1098
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,704
(I've been waiting for you to fail.)

1099
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:31,872
I got a cramp.

1100
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:34,875
(Jong Kook gives Se Chan a cramp.)

1101
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:36,243
(That's not necessary.)

1102
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,712
It hurts so much. Okay.

1103
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,013
(I better not fail this time.)

1104
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,181
Whose turn is it?

1105
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,582
- It's your turn. - It's your turn.

1106
00:39:41,582 --> 00:39:43,217
You look a bit annoyed.

1107
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:45,186
He just looked so scary.

1108
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,654
- "Whose turn is it?" - His position...

1109
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,222
- I didn't do that. - You didn't?

1110
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:49,423
Was it just me?

1111
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:50,825
It's 1 to 1 now.

1112
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:54,261
(It's Jong Kook's turn to attack.)

1113
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:56,263
Two.

1114
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,565
Gosh.

1115
00:39:57,565 --> 00:40:00,334
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

1116
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:01,802
- Did you raise your toe? - Yes.

1117
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:02,870
Why?

1118
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,872
- What about you? - I raise my toe all the time.

1119
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:07,174
- So do I. - You two...

1120
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:08,943
(Jong Kook can flick them in the forehead now.)

1121
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:10,011
(Singing)

1122
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,880
He reminds me of Choi Min Sik from "I Saw the Devil".

1123
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,181
(Choi Min Sik from "I Saw the Devil")

1124
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:17,351
(I'll flick you in the forehead when you're suffering the most.)

1125
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:20,421
This would make it easier for me.

1126
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:21,856
(Jong Kook carefully decides to use the other hand.)

1127
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,124
My right hand would be better.

1128
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:24,825
Why are you doing this?

1129
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:28,896
(Extremely scared)

1130
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,699
(Moaning)

1131
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:35,469
(Full power)

1132
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:39,040
(It's unbelievable every time.)

1133
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,143
I should have scratched his forehead.

1134
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:43,678
- Is it already over? - Is it over?

1135
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:45,713
Jong Kook wins.

1136
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:48,616
We'll give him a badge.

1137
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,851
I haven't been in the SBS building in a while.

1138
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:52,319
Me neither.

1139
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,388
She has a press conference...

1140
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,323
for her new drama.

1141
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,692
- Is this her room? - Yes.

1142
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,026
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin arrive at Hae Sun's waiting room.)

1143
00:40:59,593 --> 00:41:01,595
You should knock first.

1144
00:41:01,896 --> 00:41:04,031
(Seok Jin opens the door without knocking.)

1145
00:41:04,031 --> 00:41:05,299
We're sorry.

1146
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,334
Gosh. You have such bad manners.

1147
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:10,171
- She knows we're here. - Still...

1148
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:11,672
My goodness.

1149
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:12,973
You can't just open the door like that.

1150
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,575
Why would a door make a sound?

1151
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,110
- We're sorry. - Why would a door make a sound?

1152
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,244
- Seok Jin. - It means you should get ready.

1153
00:41:17,244 --> 00:41:19,013
You should let the person know that...

1154
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:21,182
you're coming in.

1155
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:23,684
You shouldn't just open the door.

1156
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:25,052
Are you there?

1157
00:41:25,052 --> 00:41:27,321
(Knocking)

1158
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,423
Why are you trying to be so polite?

1159
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:31,726
- This is why stars don't like you. - Hae Sun, are you in there?

1160
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:37,431
(Will Hae Sun open her door?)

1161
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,632
Hae Sun!

1162
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,101
Oh, my.

1163
00:41:40,101 --> 00:41:41,736
- Hello. - Hae Sun.

1164
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:43,804
My goodness.

1165
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:49,643
(Her drama got the highest viewer rating of 45.1 percent.)

1166
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:53,180
(Shin Hae Sun is the queen of viewer ratings.)

1167
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,382
Hae Sun is here!

1168
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:56,383
(This is my first time on Running Man.)

1169
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:59,520
It's been such a long time. You're very busy these days, right?

1170
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,821
No, I'm not.

1171
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:01,922
- You're not? - No.

1172
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,891
In the lobby,

1173
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,694
I saw you and Yang Se Jong on the screen.

1174
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,296
And there are so many fans.

1175
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,766
What changed the most...

1176
00:42:11,766 --> 00:42:14,235
after you became very popular?

1177
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:17,505
- I sleep less now. - You sleep less.

1178
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:21,075
You must be earning more money too.

1179
00:42:21,175 --> 00:42:23,611
- Right? - Right.

1180
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:26,013
(He asks her about money from the start.)

1181
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,214
You get paid more for commercials now, right?

1182
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,049
Before, I got paid so little.

1183
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:33,154
(She is so honest.)

1184
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,255
So compared to before...

1185
00:42:34,255 --> 00:42:36,824
- But I don't get paid very much. - Seok Jin.

1186
00:42:36,824 --> 00:42:39,827
I'm sorry, but stop doing this gesture.

1187
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:41,395
Don't do that.

1188
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:43,497
Anyway...

1189
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,133
- You have a press conference today. - Yes.

1190
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,502
- What time is it? - I have...

1191
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:50,504
a radio show at 1pm.

1192
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,473
- And then... - A radio show at 1pm?

1193
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:55,309
Including Tom Cruise,

1194
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,645
our guests have only one hour these days.

1195
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:59,780
(Just-1-hour guests)

1196
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,182
- Don't worry. - Okay.

1197
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:02,483
We're used to it.

1198
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:04,819
One hour is enough.

1199
00:43:04,852 --> 00:43:06,053
We're so happy to meet you.

1200
00:43:06,053 --> 00:43:08,422
- We have so many questions. - We do.

1201
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:11,725
This is so frustrating. I want to talk to her,

1202
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:14,562
but Seok Jin keeps doing ad-libs.

1203
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:17,832
How do I look?

1204
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:18,933
(Jumping)

1205
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,535
- What? - You already started?

1206
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:23,003
How do I look?

1207
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,905
(He is breathing heavily.)

1208
00:43:25,172 --> 00:43:27,141
- You look hot. - I look hot?

1209
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,642
(Why is he jumping?)

1210
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:30,144
(I am hot, indeed.)

1211
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,545
I am hot.

1212
00:43:31,545 --> 00:43:34,215
(It won't be easy for him.)

1213
00:43:34,215 --> 00:43:35,482
Why do I look hot?

1214
00:43:35,482 --> 00:43:37,084
Today...

1215
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,252
Because you're jumping?

1216
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:39,787
(That's obvious.)

1217
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:42,022
He's trying to do something.

1218
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,490
8... 8...

1219
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,326
(Seok Jin is gesturing "8".)

1220
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:48,762
Gosh, I think I'll lose.

1221
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:50,431
(Exhausted)

1222
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:53,234
- You look exhausted. - You look exhausted.

1223
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:56,837
(Is this it?)

1224
00:43:57,805 --> 00:44:00,241
- That's not it. - It'll be hard.

1225
00:44:00,241 --> 00:44:04,311
What kind of music do you listen to these days?

1226
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,513
(Is that his mission?)

1227
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:09,483
Do you listen to "Ddu-du Ddu-du" by BLACKPINK?

1228
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:12,052
This song.

1229
00:44:12,052 --> 00:44:15,089
(What is Jae Seok's mission?)

1230
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:18,425
(Make the guest copy your dance.)

1231
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,161
Don't do it.

1232
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:23,163
Preserve your dignity. Don't do it.

1233
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,499
- I have no dignity though. - Just don't do it.

1234
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:28,135
An actress should protect her image.

1235
00:44:28,135 --> 00:44:30,104
(But he can't protect his own image.)

1236
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:33,173
- Am I supposed to say something? - No.

1237
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:35,876
(It's a race against time now.)

1238
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,912
It's not very hard.

1239
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:39,513
- Try it. - Don't do it.

1240
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:41,682
Don't do it.

1241
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:44,084
You can't do it? It's so simple.

1242
00:44:44,084 --> 00:44:45,686
Try it.

1243
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,021
(She realizes what she should do.)

1244
00:44:47,021 --> 00:44:48,022
Like this?

1245
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:50,891
Try it. Start.

1246
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:54,695
(She seems to have realized something. Will she dance?)

1247
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:55,729
How do I look?

1248
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:58,699
(Dancing)

1249
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:00,167
How do I look?

1250
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,503
- You look busy. - Busy?

1251
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:04,538
(Am I wrong?)

1252
00:45:04,872 --> 00:45:07,474
- Jae Seok wins. - Why?

1253
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:09,576
Thank you.

1254
00:45:10,811 --> 00:45:12,613
Thank you, Hae Sun.

1255
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:13,681
She danced.

1256
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:15,382
- This? - Yes.

1257
00:45:15,382 --> 00:45:17,885
Let's start the 2 to 1 competition now.

1258
00:45:18,652 --> 00:45:20,154
We'll play...

1259
00:45:20,154 --> 00:45:22,189
the Spot the Difference game in the waiting room.

1260
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:23,924
(Spot the Difference)

1261
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,225
Spot the Difference?

1262
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,094
There will be offense and defense.

1263
00:45:27,094 --> 00:45:29,163
Within a minute, you have to find...

1264
00:45:29,163 --> 00:45:31,832
- 5 differences in this room. - 5?

1265
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:34,401
- Find more differences to win. - Within a minute?

1266
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,103
- We'll find the differences first. - Okay.

1267
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,205
(Jae Seok and Hae Sun will find the differences first.)

1268
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:40,407
What should I do?

1269
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:43,477
I'll put it here.

1270
00:45:44,345 --> 00:45:46,480
(He is thinking hard.)

1271
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,283
- I'll sit here. - We have a big advantage.

1272
00:45:49,283 --> 00:45:51,652
We're two people.

1273
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:53,120
In addition,

1274
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,621
Seok Jin is...

1275
00:45:54,621 --> 00:45:57,091
someone who doesn't pay attention to things.

1276
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:58,392
(We're confident.)

1277
00:45:58,392 --> 00:45:59,493
Come in.

1278
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:01,929
Can we come in? So this is the original version?

1279
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:15,843
(The original version)

1280
00:46:16,243 --> 00:46:18,212
(They can observe for 3 minutes.)

1281
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:19,513
- It's very unique. - We should pay attention.

1282
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:21,281
- Hae Sun, pay attention. - Okay.

1283
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:25,786
Pay attention to things like this. Remember the direction of it.

1284
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,955
(I'll remember everything.)

1285
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:30,424
I hope he won't be so mean as to mix these up.

1286
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:31,625
There are six of them.

1287
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,893
(Shaking)

1288
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:34,061
My arm hurts.

1289
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,163
(The bottle is heavy.)

1290
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:39,566
You should keep your arm up.

1291
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:42,102
There are two of them.

1292
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:43,937
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1293
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:45,672
There are five of them.

1294
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:49,343
(If no one's watching, I can put my arm down, right?)

1295
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,045
Keep your arm up.

1296
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:52,980
- Don't put it down. - Hurry up.

1297
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,648
You shouldn't put your arm down.

1298
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:55,883
All right.

1299
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,451
- You're very observant. - We're done.

1300
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,452
- Okay. - We checked everything.

1301
00:46:58,452 --> 00:47:00,254
You can move things around for a minute.

1302
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,522
A minute after they leave the room.

1303
00:47:01,522 --> 00:47:04,425
He won't be able to change anything. He's so bad at games.

1304
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:06,393
- There will be five differences. - Okay.

1305
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:08,495
What if he fails to change five things?

1306
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:11,365
- What if he changes only two? - I wouldn't be surprised.

1307
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:14,234
They paid attention to such details.

1308
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,403
They checked everywhere.

1309
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:20,541
(Noises)

1310
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,276
He's obviously moving the chair.

1311
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:26,513
(He moved five things.)

1312
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:29,183
- Time is up. You can go in. - Should we go in?

1313
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,250
Let's find everything at once.

1314
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,253
(They have 1 minute to find the differences.)

1315
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:35,722
He's holding a different bottle.

1316
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,925
(Is it that obvious?)

1317
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:40,561
The bottle has changed. The chair has changed too.

1318
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:43,597
- The chair and this. - It moved.

1319
00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:47,167
(They've found 3 in 10 seconds.)

1320
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,137
- It's back here. - That's right.

1321
00:47:50,504 --> 00:47:52,272
Oh, these got switched.

1322
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:54,775
- This and that. - They got switched.

1323
00:47:55,242 --> 00:47:57,244
- I think we're done. - We're done.

1324
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:59,079
- Aren't we done? - There's one left.

1325
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,314
- There's 1 left? - There's 1 left?

1326
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:02,282
(He tells them the truth himself.)

1327
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:04,084
You shouldn't tell them.

1328
00:48:04,952 --> 00:48:06,220
Thank you.

1329
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,654
(Thank you for letting us know.)

1330
00:48:07,654 --> 00:48:08,822
(What's with me?)

1331
00:48:08,822 --> 00:48:10,457
What could be the last one?

1332
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:12,292
I have no idea.

1333
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,694
There's 10 seconds left.

1334
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:15,896
10, 9,

1335
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,899
- 8, 7, - What is it?

1336
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:21,835
- 6, 5... - Hold on.

1337
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:24,605
Hold on.

1338
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:25,772
The towel?

1339
00:48:25,772 --> 00:48:27,774
- No. It's the same. - It's the same?

1340
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,643
(The minute is over.)

1341
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:30,744
Okay.

1342
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:32,980
(They couldn't find the last one.)

1343
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,181
What is the last one?

1344
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,883
(They have to say the 5 differences now.)

1345
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,317
I don't know the last one.

1346
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,353
That's a relief.

1347
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:41,688
If they didn't find everything, I still have a chance.

1348
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,091
- Then... - Hold on.

1349
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:45,759
(Hold on.)

1350
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,227
Should I tell you?

1351
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:50,564
- You have three seconds. - This.

1352
00:48:50,864 --> 00:48:52,733
(The mirror looks different.)

1353
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:54,134
One more time.

1354
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:56,403
That's right!

1355
00:48:56,403 --> 00:48:59,173
- That's right! - The mirror.

1356
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:03,744
(Is it one of the differences?)

1357
00:49:03,744 --> 00:49:05,012
The mirror.

1358
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,013
It's correct.

1359
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:07,014
(That was amazing.)

1360
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,415
I knew it.

1361
00:49:08,515 --> 00:49:10,651
- You're the best. - The mirror.

1362
00:49:10,651 --> 00:49:14,021
The bag, the chair, the pot, the bottle,

1363
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:15,322
- and the mirror. - The mirror.

1364
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,424
- Now... - Leave the room.

1365
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:20,561
Gosh. I'm bad at this.

1366
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:22,162
(I'm bad at this kind of game.)

1367
00:49:22,162 --> 00:49:24,731
I'm bad at finding differences.

1368
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:28,202
We'll do something simple to show how terrible Seok Jin is.

1369
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:29,570
You'll see.

1370
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,406
We'll make it much simpler.

1371
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,874
- This is the original. - Yes.

1372
00:49:33,874 --> 00:49:35,142
Come in.

1373
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:37,544
Shall I take a look?

1374
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,047
What happened?

1375
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:48,455
(The original version)

1376
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:51,391
Okay.

1377
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:52,926
The mirror is over there.

1378
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:54,461
Here's the chair.

1379
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:55,729
(He pretends to be detailed.)

1380
00:49:55,729 --> 00:49:58,165
What are you trying to do?

1381
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:00,534
There are two of each.

1382
00:50:00,534 --> 00:50:02,169
2, 2, and 2.

1383
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,804
There are six chairs.

1384
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:06,273
On the ceiling...

1385
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:07,874
The ceiling?

1386
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:10,410
There are four lights.

1387
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,912
(He checks useless places.)

1388
00:50:11,912 --> 00:50:14,481
- Okay. - See how dull he is.

1389
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:16,083
No, I'm very sharp.

1390
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:17,351
- Let's go. - Okay.

1391
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:18,452
Here we go.

1392
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:19,720
- Okay. - Okay.

1393
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,622
(What simple changes will they make?)

1394
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,523
There's nothing to change.

1395
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,226
You have one minute.

1396
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,195
Change the watch.

1397
00:50:28,729 --> 00:50:30,163
(He puts his watch on the other wrist.)

1398
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,665
I'll move them...

1399
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:33,033
like this.

1400
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:34,601
(She moves the snacks.)

1401
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:35,702
He won't recognize this.

1402
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:36,770
(He changes to a different color hat.)

1403
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,672
If I roll up my sleeve, won't it be easy?

1404
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:41,174
(She rolls up her sleeves.)

1405
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,743
Switch places.

1406
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:43,744
Okay.

1407
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:44,811
(They switch their places.)

1408
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:46,513
- Please come in. - Okay.

1409
00:50:46,913 --> 00:50:48,081
Five things.

1410
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:49,883
(He has 1 minute.)

1411
00:50:49,883 --> 00:50:53,954
(Will Seok Jin recognize that they switched places?)

1412
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:55,555
Two people.

1413
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,891
(There are still two people.)

1414
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:01,094
(How can he be so inattentive?)

1415
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:03,930
(He passes by the disorganized snacks.)

1416
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,332
Are there five differences?

1417
00:51:05,332 --> 00:51:07,167
(Are there five differences?)

1418
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,438
(He's much duller than the rumors say.)

1419
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:19,112
(He stares at them. Did he notice the difference?)

1420
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:20,914
(He passes by.)

1421
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,884
(His indifference doesn't disappoint them.)

1422
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:25,252
That's impressive.

1423
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:26,586
What is?

1424
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,222
Wait, give me more time.

1425
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:31,191
The mirror is the same.

1426
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,592
He's an icon of indifference.

1427
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:33,794
Seriously.

1428
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:35,329
- I know. - It's unbelievable.

1429
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,130
He's only interested in himself.

1430
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,598
Goodness.

1431
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:43,403
There's something on top which wasn't there before.

1432
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:44,671
On top.

1433
00:51:44,671 --> 00:51:46,573
(It has been there.)

1434
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:49,076
(He stares.)

1435
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:51,712
(Did he finally recognize it?)

1436
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:53,213
Weren't you doing this before?

1437
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:55,015
(Weren't you doing this before?)

1438
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,483
(His mistake is so frustrating that it's impressive.)

1439
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,452
Were his hands by his side?

1440
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,986
Were they by his side?

1441
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,722
There must be something here.

1442
00:52:01,722 --> 00:52:04,257
- 10. - Weren't you wearing heels?

1443
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:06,593
Eight.

1444
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:09,062
- Seven. - Wait, I have no idea.

1445
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:10,764
What is it?

1446
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,199
- Seriously. - Okay.

1447
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,200
I'll say five differences.

1448
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,301
(The time is up.)

1449
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,702
I need to guess.

1450
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:17,804
I'm sure this one is different.

1451
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,773
I think it was over there.

1452
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:23,243
These moved from here to there.

1453
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,781
That thing on top wasn't there before.

1454
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:29,416
That plastic bag on top.

1455
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:32,853
What are the last two?

1456
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,821
Did that many change?

1457
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:37,124
Please say the answers.

1458
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:41,061
We switched places. We thought you'd notice.

1459
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:42,562
Goodness.

1460
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:44,531
My watch moved to the right wrist.

1461
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,967
- How would I guess that? - Why not?

1462
00:52:47,134 --> 00:52:49,002
How would I guess that?

1463
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,071
Why couldn't you?

1464
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,073
- You're so dull. - How can I guess that?

1465
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:54,441
Why not? This cap...

1466
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,143
isn't mine.

1467
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:57,310
It isn't?

1468
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,646
(It isn't?)

1469
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:02,082
- How would I guess that? - Why wouldn't you?

1470
00:53:02,082 --> 00:53:04,751
- They're so different. - The color is very different.

1471
00:53:04,751 --> 00:53:05,952
How can you not see that?

1472
00:53:05,952 --> 00:53:07,020
How could I?

1473
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,022
Did you see how surprised Hae Sun was?

1474
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,924
- She was so surprised. - It was unbelievable.

1475
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:12,392
- All we did... - I had no idea.

1476
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,161
Was switch places.

1477
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:16,263
- How could you not know? - Jae Seok won.

1478
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:17,931
He wins an eight.

1479
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:19,533
(Jae Seok gets an 8.)

1480
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,169
- I knew it when we teamed up. - Thank you.

1481
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:23,270
Thank you.

1482
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,571
This is for Hae Sun.

1483
00:53:24,571 --> 00:53:26,072
(Hae Sun gets a red ginseng gift set.)

1484
00:53:26,072 --> 00:53:29,443
It's not much, but we'll give a present to Hae Sun.

1485
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:30,710
Thank you.

1486
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:32,512
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1487
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:34,414
(Thank you, I enjoyed it.)

1488
00:53:35,182 --> 00:53:36,349
Let's go.

1489
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:37,984
- Let's finish it. - Okay.

1490
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:42,222
Here's your mission with the guests. It's called Challenge 88 Points.

1491
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,591
(Challenge 88 Points)

1492
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:46,793
Each of you will sing one song.

1493
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:49,429
The team to score closest to 88 points wins.

1494
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:51,765
- We shouldn't sing so well. - That's right.

1495
00:53:51,765 --> 00:53:54,501
Score as closest to 88 points. This is our 8th anniversary.

1496
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:56,403
- It's so difficult. - What on earth?

1497
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:58,972
(Mamamoo and Ji Hyo versus Haha)

1498
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:00,574
("Tears" by So Chan Whee and "Don't Laugh" by Haha and Skull)

1499
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,144
(Will Mamamoo score 88 points for Ji Hyo?)

1500
00:54:04,144 --> 00:54:05,912
("Tears" by So Chan Whee)
subtitles synced and corrected by riri13

1501
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:07,113
Look at her.

1502
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:08,515
(They get ready.)

1503
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:10,250
- She's different. - She's completely ready.

1504
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,353
(The performance queen starts off differently.)

1505
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,622
(How will Mamamoo sing?)

1506
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:17,724
1, 2, 3, go.

1507
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:22,596
(Everybody, shake your body.)

1508
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:24,531
Look at her.

1509
00:54:24,531 --> 00:54:26,333
(She dances against the wall.)

1510
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:29,503
(It seems like she had a drink at a gopchang restaurant.)

1511
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:31,371
Everyone, please score 88 points.

1512
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:32,806
(Don't sing too well.)

1513
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:35,542
(Nothing is going on with me)

1514
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:36,710
Mamamoo

1515
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,079
(She shows off her talent as soon as she grabs a microphone.)

1516
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:40,447
Mamamoo

1517
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:46,086
(Scoring 88 points isn't her priority.)

1518
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,724
(Rapper Hwasa's high pitch part)

1519
00:54:50,724 --> 00:54:51,791
(She sings in high pitch.)

1520
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:53,527
That was good.

1521
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,596
- You're Mamamoo. - Get ready!

1522
00:54:57,531 --> 00:54:59,866
Don't sing too hard.

1523
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:06,840
(They know the mission, but they get too excited with the high pitch.)

1524
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,074
Mamamoo

1525
00:55:08,074 --> 00:55:10,544
(She's worried that they'll score 100 points.)

1526
00:55:11,645 --> 00:55:13,313
Don't get so emotional.

1527
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:16,783
(Their singing makes the viewers content, but Ji Hyo anxious.)

1528
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:18,385
(Nice, Mamamoo.)

1529
00:55:18,652 --> 00:55:22,088
(Erase everything)

1530
00:55:22,088 --> 00:55:25,292
(They remember their mission of scoring 88 points...)

1531
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:28,595
(only at the last moment.)

1532
00:55:29,029 --> 00:55:30,997
What's wrong with you today?

1533
00:55:31,631 --> 00:55:35,435
(They can't control their excitement.)

1534
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:39,906
That was amazing.

1535
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:41,641
You sang so well.

1536
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:42,842
"Tears" is...

1537
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:43,843
(They sang "Tears".)

1538
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:45,579
(Did they score close to 88 points?)

1539
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:46,613
Please.

1540
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:48,214
(Did they score close to 88 points?)

1541
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,620
(They score 99 points.)

1542
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,921
- What? - 99.

1543
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:56,289
(It shouldn't be 99 points.)

1544
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:58,758
It's because Mamamoo sang.

1545
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:01,494
(We sang so carelessly.)

1546
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:04,064
- It's because of them. - How could we score 99 points?

1547
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:05,432
You scored 99 points.

1548
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:07,701
(If Haha scores between 78 to 98, he wins.)

1549
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:09,069
Give me the microphone.

1550
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:10,203
("Don't Laugh")

1551
00:56:10,203 --> 00:56:11,571
It'll be easy. Okay.

1552
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:14,474
(He chooses his own song with confidence.)

1553
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,476
(Ji Hyo approaches.)

1554
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:18,912
(She disturbs him.)

1555
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:20,547
You're the best

1556
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:25,986
(She disturbs him with Mamamoo's song.)

1557
00:56:26,219 --> 00:56:29,222
(Mamamoo also starts to disturb him.)

1558
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:31,024
You're all bullies!

1559
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:35,328
(Despite the disturbance, )

1560
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:38,298
(he continues his Korean, reggae song.)

1561
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,867
(He's annoyed.)

1562
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,502
(Despite Mamamoo's interruption, )

1563
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,804
(Haha does his best.)

1564
00:56:44,804 --> 00:56:48,074
(Haha's song is over.)

1565
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:51,044
(Ji Hyo and Mamamoo scored 99 points.)

1566
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:54,381
(Haha wins if he scores 11 points lower or higher than 88 points.)

1567
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,687
(Haha's song is over.)

1568
00:57:00,687 --> 00:57:01,755
(Ji Hyo and Mamamoo scored 99 points.)
(Haha's song is over.)

1569
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,056
(Ji Hyo and Mamamoo scored 99 points.)

1570
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:06,393
(Haha wins if he scores 11 points lower or higher than 88 points.)

1571
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,430
(The score is exactly 88 points.)

1572
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,232
(Haha scores exactly 88 points.)

1573
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:14,000
(Is it for real?)

1574
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,935
(How is this possible?)

1575
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,303
That's a lie.

1576
00:57:17,303 --> 00:57:22,342
(He's so happy that he can fly.)

1577
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:25,178
- 88 points. - How is it possible?

1578
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:26,646
It gives me goosebumps.

1579
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:30,083
(The problem is that Mamamoo sang too well.)

1580
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:32,285
I thought that...

1581
00:57:32,352 --> 00:57:33,720
Something went well.

1582
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,655
(A miracle moves him.)

1583
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:37,490
I'm a little disappointed...

1584
00:57:37,524 --> 00:57:39,292
because I tried my best.

1585
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:42,028
(However, he only scored 88 points.)

1586
00:57:42,028 --> 00:57:44,931
- Don't you feel sorry to Skull? - 88 points...

1587
00:57:44,998 --> 00:57:47,600
You tried your best, but you only scored 88 points.

1588
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,036
I concentrated and did my best.

1589
00:57:50,036 --> 00:57:51,871
(Haha wins an 8.)

1590
00:57:52,672 --> 00:57:54,908
So Min cleared the mission.

1591
00:57:54,908 --> 00:57:56,409
- Thank you. - So Min is...

1592
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:57,811
on Dong Il's team.

1593
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,447
You're on your own now. I'm on your team.

1594
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:02,248
It's 2 against 1.

1595
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:03,850
- We'll definitely win. - Now,

1596
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,985
I'm tired of you.

1597
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:07,620
(I'm tired of you.)

1598
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,290
What do you mean?

1599
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,093
I've been with you for two years on dramas and films.

1600
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:15,261
We've worked together for two years in a row.

1601
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:18,798
If you win by yourself, that'll be highly rewarding.

1602
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,302
There's favoritism too.

1603
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,671
- That's right. - I may lose on purpose for you.

1604
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:25,672
That's right.

1605
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,641
(That's an important point.)

1606
00:58:28,641 --> 00:58:30,443
- Yes. - We'll keep seeing each other.

1607
00:58:30,443 --> 00:58:32,011
Yes, that's right.

1608
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:35,448
That's right. We'll last forever.

1609
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:38,418
I got this far with that type of personality.

1610
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:40,854
- You don't know what I'll do. - That's true.

1611
00:58:40,854 --> 00:58:42,322
My wife doesn't trust me either.

1612
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:45,592
- No, she trusts you. - My kids don't trust me either.

1613
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:47,694
- No way. - I argued yesterday again...

1614
00:58:47,727 --> 00:58:49,796
- with the kids. - Stop it.

1615
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:52,265
Don't say that.

1616
00:58:52,265 --> 00:58:56,269
Your mission is called 3 Watermelon Games.

1617
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:57,504
- Watermelons? - Yes.

1618
00:58:57,504 --> 00:59:00,774
It's best 2 out of 3, and it's 2 on 1.

1619
00:59:00,774 --> 00:59:04,511
The first mission is called Fold the Watermelon Tube.

1620
00:59:04,511 --> 00:59:06,679
The team that deflates the watermelon tube first...

1621
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:08,615
and puts it in a container wins.

1622
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:10,416
That?

1623
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:11,751
It's better to have two people then.

1624
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,120
I can do it. I'll do this. Okay.

1625
00:59:14,287 --> 00:59:16,489
- Let's make a plan. - Okay.

1626
00:59:16,489 --> 00:59:18,591
(You're making a plan?)

1627
00:59:18,591 --> 00:59:21,394
- The stopper comes up, right? - Yes, we have to push it down.

1628
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:24,597
We have to push it down, so you can push it down...

1629
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:26,800
- while I take the air out. - Okay.

1630
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,201
All right.

1631
00:59:28,268 --> 00:59:29,502
He's so...

1632
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:31,938
(He calls Kwang Soo over this time.)

1633
00:59:33,106 --> 00:59:36,242
(Is he telling Kwang Soo his plan?)

1634
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,512
Try your best.

1635
00:59:39,512 --> 00:59:40,513
(This is Dong Il's incredible plan.)

1636
00:59:40,513 --> 00:59:42,949
I will. He told me...

1637
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,284
to try my best.

1638
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:46,586
Once you close the container, you are done.

1639
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:48,788
- Okay. - He said he's on my side.

1640
00:59:48,788 --> 00:59:49,889
He's like a spy.

1641
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,391
(Trust me, Kwang Soo.)

1642
00:59:51,391 --> 00:59:52,692
Ready,

1643
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:53,893
set, go.

1644
00:59:53,893 --> 00:59:55,762
Take it out.

1645
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:57,897
Pull it.

1646
00:59:57,897 --> 00:59:58,898
(Struggling)

1647
00:59:58,898 --> 01:00:00,466
Why can't I open this?

1648
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:03,403
(With Dong Il's help, So Min opens the stopper.)

1649
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:04,437
Hold onto it.

1650
01:00:04,437 --> 01:00:06,039
(With Dong Il's help, So Min opens the stopper.)

1651
01:00:06,706 --> 01:00:08,575
(He's very focused.)

1652
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:11,010
(He pushes with his whole body.)

1653
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,579
(Air escapes.)

1654
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:14,013
You have to hold with both hands.

1655
01:00:14,013 --> 01:00:15,315
(What?)

1656
01:00:15,315 --> 01:00:17,050
You said you'd help me.

1657
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:19,652
I'll push down.

1658
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:21,654
You said you'd help me.

1659
01:00:21,654 --> 01:00:23,423
That's what you said.

1660
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,024
- What? - He's taking a break.

1661
01:00:25,024 --> 01:00:26,659
(I'm just taking a break. Why?)

1662
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:28,428
He's taking a break.

1663
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:30,063
(With Dong Il's hard work, So Min and Dong Il get ahead.)

1664
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:31,798
I'll do this.

1665
01:00:32,398 --> 01:00:33,399
(He's behind.)

1666
01:00:33,399 --> 01:00:34,734
Okay.

1667
01:00:35,201 --> 01:00:37,604
(I'm going to rip this apart.)

1668
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:39,906
You can't do that.

1669
01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:42,542
- He's ripping it. - You can't push down. Take it out.

1670
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:44,210
He's ripping it.

1671
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,278
(There he goes again.)

1672
01:00:45,278 --> 01:00:46,679
He's always like that.

1673
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:49,582
(It's all about the victory. He doesn't hear a thing.)

1674
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:51,951
Look at him. Look what he's doing.

1675
01:00:51,951 --> 01:00:54,287
He already lost.

1676
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,489
My kids are watching.

1677
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,191
(Kwang Soo, my kids are watching.)

1678
01:00:58,224 --> 01:01:00,526
Jun, Bin, and Yul are watching.

1679
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:02,195
That's right. They'll watch and learn.

1680
01:01:02,195 --> 01:01:04,063
They'll watch and learn from you.

1681
01:01:04,063 --> 01:01:05,765
Jun, watch "King of Mask Singer" for a moment.

1682
01:01:05,765 --> 01:01:07,333
(He begs urgently.)

1683
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,202
Jun, change the channel for a moment.

1684
01:01:09,202 --> 01:01:11,137
(He's the biggest cheater in town.)

1685
01:01:11,137 --> 01:01:14,407
(He cheats and starts folding the tube first.)

1686
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:16,676
Jun, change the channel for a moment.

1687
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:18,778
(I don't know anymore.)

1688
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:20,079
Hey.

1689
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,383
(So Min runs away with the container.)

1690
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,519
(Goodness)

1691
01:01:27,153 --> 01:01:29,856
(I'm going to keep going.)

1692
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:31,691
(Kwang Soo runs after her.)

1693
01:01:31,691 --> 01:01:34,894
Dong Il, give me a few moments.

1694
01:01:34,894 --> 01:01:37,530
(This game becomes messy.)

1695
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,198
That little...

1696
01:01:39,632 --> 01:01:41,935
(She runs out.)

1697
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:44,103
Where did she go?

1698
01:01:46,172 --> 01:01:48,942
Will this fit?

1699
01:01:49,175 --> 01:01:52,812
(Dong Il does it the right way.)

1700
01:01:53,646 --> 01:01:54,781
Where did you go?

1701
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:58,017
(This is a noneducational scene that kids shouldn't watch.)

1702
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:00,653
(She goes into the scorching heat.)

1703
01:02:00,653 --> 01:02:03,089
I'm barefoot. What do I do?

1704
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,557
Goodness.

1705
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,393
What is wrong with her?

1706
01:02:07,393 --> 01:02:09,429
(The two biggest cheaters roam around Gangnam.)

1707
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,264
(He folds it one by one.)

1708
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:13,199
This is not the stopper.

1709
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:15,702
Where did they go?

1710
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:20,506
Isn't it better to be doing this?

1711
01:02:20,506 --> 01:02:22,442
Why do they live like that?

1712
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:24,010
(It must be tiring to live like that.)

1713
01:02:24,644 --> 01:02:26,980
You don't even have shoes on. What are you doing?

1714
01:02:27,013 --> 01:02:28,581
You're an idiot.

1715
01:02:28,581 --> 01:02:29,983
(This is ridiculous.)

1716
01:02:30,883 --> 01:02:33,286
Do you think Dong Il's done?

1717
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:36,589
(She steals the lid again.)

1718
01:02:37,991 --> 01:02:39,926
This is not how you play this game!

1719
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:42,762
(She is about to go into the building.)

1720
01:02:43,262 --> 01:02:46,366
(She hides the lid in the entrance.)

1721
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:50,903
When you get old, you have to do things slowly.

1722
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:54,073
It's dangerous. I have high blood pressure.

1723
01:02:54,073 --> 01:02:56,209
(He's worried about his health.)

1724
01:02:56,209 --> 01:02:58,277
I didn't have my shoes on.

1725
01:02:58,277 --> 01:03:01,547
I hid it.

1726
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:04,751
Why is she doing this?

1727
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:06,853
- Where's the lid? - What?

1728
01:03:06,853 --> 01:03:09,288
- Where's the lid? - I don't know. This is ours.

1729
01:03:09,288 --> 01:03:11,457
- Hold this down. - What's this?

1730
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:13,760
This game isn't supposed to be like this.

1731
01:03:14,494 --> 01:03:16,529
I just have to close this.

1732
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:19,966
- It won't work. - It won't.

1733
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:22,035
This is not a searching game.

1734
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:25,738
(He searches everywhere.)

1735
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,542
(He finds an extra lid.)

1736
01:03:29,542 --> 01:03:32,345
We have no time.

1737
01:03:33,246 --> 01:03:35,982
(Both teams try to close the lid. They have to close it completely.)

1738
01:03:35,982 --> 01:03:37,750
It worked.

1739
01:03:37,984 --> 01:03:40,353
(He forces it in.)

1740
01:03:40,353 --> 01:03:41,487
It worked.

1741
01:03:41,487 --> 01:03:42,855
(Will it be this team that has more people but is slow?)

1742
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:46,926
(Or will it be Kwang Soo who's alone but uses all kinds of tactics?)

1743
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:51,130
(Which team will close the lid first?)

1744
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:53,299
- Dong Il and So Min win. - Hold on.

1745
01:03:53,299 --> 01:03:55,234
(Dong Il and So Min win.)

1746
01:03:55,234 --> 01:03:56,869
Hold on.

1747
01:03:57,103 --> 01:03:58,938
(He's almost there.)

1748
01:03:59,405 --> 01:04:02,041
Come here. Bring it.

1749
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:03,676
Bring it.

1750
01:04:03,676 --> 01:04:06,312
I thought you'd be on my side. Why are you mad?

1751
01:04:06,312 --> 01:04:08,247
You said you'd be on my side.

1752
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,016
- Why are you mad? - This is so tiring.

1753
01:04:10,016 --> 01:04:11,884
You said you were on my side.

1754
01:04:11,884 --> 01:04:14,020
- Hey. - You said there's favoritism.

1755
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,956
If he can close this in 10 seconds,

1756
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:18,224
we lose.

1757
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:19,759
(He makes a suggestion.)

1758
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:21,060
- Really? Okay. - Sure.

1759
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,762
If not,

1760
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:24,430
So Min can slap your cheek.

1761
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:25,932
(That's if you can't do it.)

1762
01:04:26,365 --> 01:04:28,000
- Oh, gosh. - 10 seconds.

1763
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,203
- But... - I'm giving you a chance.

1764
01:04:30,236 --> 01:04:32,371
I thought you were on my side.

1765
01:04:32,438 --> 01:04:34,340
That's why I'm giving you this opportunity, you fool.

1766
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,808
- Okay. - I tried it.

1767
01:04:35,808 --> 01:04:37,076
- You can close it in five seconds. - Ready.

1768
01:04:37,076 --> 01:04:38,744
- 10 seconds? - Ready... 10 seconds.

1769
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:40,580
(He's finally taking my side.)

1770
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:41,614
- Okay. - Set, go.

1771
01:04:41,614 --> 01:04:43,082
(The additional 10 seconds start.)

1772
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:47,386
10 seconds is enough. You can do it in 5 seconds.

1773
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:48,387
Once I close it, this is over.

1774
01:04:48,387 --> 01:04:50,823
(This is Dong Il's bonus for Kwang Soo.)

1775
01:04:50,823 --> 01:04:53,793
(Can Kwang Soo live up to his expectation?)

1776
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:54,894
- It's done. - It's over.

1777
01:04:54,894 --> 01:04:56,596
- You're done. - Slap him.

1778
01:04:57,263 --> 01:04:59,532
(He automatically tells her to slap him.)

1779
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:02,535
You can't do it in 10 seconds.

1780
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,070
We did it.

1781
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,038
- I'll go for your forehead. - I can't...

1782
01:05:06,038 --> 01:05:07,206
(This is ridiculous.)

1783
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:09,208
You said there's favoritism.

1784
01:05:09,208 --> 01:05:10,877
I can go the other way too.

1785
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:14,113
See? I can.

1786
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,483
- I see that. - I can go both ways.

1787
01:05:17,483 --> 01:05:19,886
- He told me to. - This is a penalty.

1788
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:23,222
There are rules. You cheated.

1789
01:05:23,222 --> 01:05:25,658
You need to be penalized. The viewers who are watching...

1790
01:05:25,658 --> 01:05:28,995
with their kids can say, "You get hit when you cheat."

1791
01:05:28,995 --> 01:05:30,329
(He represents the viewers.)

1792
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:31,397
(Do you have to get hit?)

1793
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:33,866
- You get hit? - Yes,

1794
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:35,701
- this is public broadcasting. - I though he was on my side.

1795
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:37,637
Families watch this.

1796
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:39,405
Be gentle.

1797
01:05:39,405 --> 01:05:40,873
It's been such a long time. I don't want to hit your eyes.

1798
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:43,209
I'd close my eyes. It feels better.

1799
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:45,745
(Children, if you cheat, you get slapped.)

1800
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:49,048
(This is a lesson for many young viewers.)

1801
01:05:49,048 --> 01:05:51,751
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

1802
01:05:51,751 --> 01:05:53,886
It's okay. You've sinned.

1803
01:05:53,886 --> 01:05:55,288
Goodness.

1804
01:05:55,288 --> 01:05:57,223
You're making a fool out of us honest people.

1805
01:05:57,223 --> 01:05:59,225
- Okay. I'm sorry. - We took the air out.

1806
01:05:59,525 --> 01:06:01,394
- Apologize to the viewers. - I'm sorry.

1807
01:06:01,394 --> 01:06:03,496
- You get hit when you cheat. - That's right.

1808
01:06:03,496 --> 01:06:06,199
You get hit when you cheat.

1809
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:09,869
(Running Man creates a world where you get hit when you cheat.)

1810
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:12,705
(So Min and Dong Il win the first mission.)

1811
01:06:12,705 --> 01:06:13,873
The second mission...

1812
01:06:13,873 --> 01:06:14,907
(Following is the second mission.)

1813
01:06:14,907 --> 01:06:16,909
It's Watermelon Seeds Lottery.

1814
01:06:16,909 --> 01:06:18,778
It's a lottery.

1815
01:06:18,778 --> 01:06:21,147
There are three small watermelons in front of you.

1816
01:06:21,147 --> 01:06:24,483
You can pick a watermelon you like and split it in half.

1817
01:06:24,483 --> 01:06:26,385
You pick a side,

1818
01:06:26,385 --> 01:06:28,988
- and you win with the most seeds. - This sounds fun.

1819
01:06:28,988 --> 01:06:30,623
(The person with the most seeds win.)

1820
01:06:30,856 --> 01:06:33,159
This is like an old game.

1821
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,895
- Is it? - We play by ourselves.

1822
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:37,396
Okay, you never know.

1823
01:06:37,396 --> 01:06:39,532
Please pick one each.

1824
01:06:39,665 --> 01:06:41,701
Which one do you think has more seeds?

1825
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:43,769
- The ripe one? - Right.

1826
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:44,804
(Which one has more seeds?)

1827
01:06:44,804 --> 01:06:47,039
- This... - "Authentic Masterpiece".

1828
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,041
- Please cue the music. - Pick one.

1829
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,376
All right.

1830
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,311
- Okay. Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1831
01:06:52,311 --> 01:06:53,746
(Kwang Soo gets to pick second.)

1832
01:06:53,746 --> 01:06:55,081
Okay.

1833
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:56,949
That's fine.

1834
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,685
This one's the widest.

1835
01:06:59,685 --> 01:07:00,987
(He has a good feeling.)

1836
01:07:00,987 --> 01:07:02,788
- Good. - Okay. You go first, So Min.

1837
01:07:02,788 --> 01:07:04,323
(So Min goes first.)

1838
01:07:04,323 --> 01:07:06,392
It's better to cut it vertically.

1839
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:07,393
Can we cut it vertically?

1840
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:08,694
- Of course. - It doesn't matter.

1841
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:10,963
Hold on. Mine's the smallest.

1842
01:07:10,963 --> 01:07:11,964
It is.

1843
01:07:11,964 --> 01:07:13,566
(His is the smallest vertically.)

1844
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:16,502
- You can cut it vertically? - I was ready...

1845
01:07:16,502 --> 01:07:18,871
- to cut it vertically. - We can cut it vertically?

1846
01:07:18,871 --> 01:07:20,706
Of course. As long as you cut it somehow.

1847
01:07:20,706 --> 01:07:22,141
This is an apple.

1848
01:07:22,141 --> 01:07:23,476
(So Min's watermelon looks long.)

1849
01:07:25,077 --> 01:07:26,746
You can stick one side out.

1850
01:07:26,746 --> 01:07:28,481
Is it left or right?

1851
01:07:28,481 --> 01:07:30,383
- I say left. - Left.

1852
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:32,218
It's this side.

1853
01:07:32,351 --> 01:07:34,120
(It's Kwang Soo's turn.)

1854
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,088
It's the same regardless of where I cut.

1855
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:37,523
- It's small. - It's circular,

1856
01:07:37,523 --> 01:07:39,392
so it doesn't matter where you cut.

1857
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:40,393
The widest part.

1858
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:41,394
(He finds the widest side. What will be the result?)

1859
01:07:41,394 --> 01:07:42,495
- Pick one side. - There are not that many seeds.

1860
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:44,263
I pick left.

1861
01:07:44,964 --> 01:07:46,299
(He picked first.)

1862
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:47,500
It's ripe.

1863
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,235
(He's careful.)

1864
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:51,504
(He takes a peek inside.)

1865
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:54,707
- Hold on. I'm not in the middle. - I thought...

1866
01:07:54,707 --> 01:07:56,409
(Is he changing the direction?)

1867
01:07:56,409 --> 01:07:57,910
I'm not in the middle.

1868
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,312
Wait.

1869
01:07:59,979 --> 01:08:01,514
I'm not in the middle. Let go.

1870
01:08:01,514 --> 01:08:03,015
(Is he changing directions again?)

1871
01:08:03,015 --> 01:08:05,117
- I have to cut it properly. - Why do you keep cutting it again?

1872
01:08:05,117 --> 01:08:07,620
- I'm not in the middle. - Once you cut, it's over.

1873
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,788
That's not true.

1874
01:08:08,788 --> 01:08:11,590
- I didn't cut it completely. - He didn't. It's okay.

1875
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,359
- This is good. - It looks like...

1876
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:16,128
he's cutting fish. He's making thin cuts.

1877
01:08:16,128 --> 01:08:17,897
I'm right in the middle.

1878
01:08:17,897 --> 01:08:18,998
It's ripe.

1879
01:08:18,998 --> 01:08:20,633
This is the biggest watermelon.

1880
01:08:20,633 --> 01:08:22,668
- You should pick this side. - That's right.

1881
01:08:23,336 --> 01:08:25,905
This is the side you're not picking, right?

1882
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:28,007
Let's check one by one.

1883
01:08:28,441 --> 01:08:29,875
Do I go first?

1884
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:31,844
I hope there are many seeds.

1885
01:08:32,478 --> 01:08:34,347
- Let's go with So Min. - Okay.

1886
01:08:34,347 --> 01:08:35,781
I'll show you.

1887
01:08:35,815 --> 01:08:39,752
(She picked last. How many seeds does she have?)

1888
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,088
I'll show you.

1889
01:08:42,088 --> 01:08:43,189
Ta-da.

1890
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:44,457
(It's filled with seeds.)

1891
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,891
There are so many.

1892
01:08:46,192 --> 01:08:47,293
(This watermelon is filled with seeds.)

1893
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:49,362
- There's a lot. - There are so many.

1894
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,963
- Kwang Soo is next. - Kwang Soo.

1895
01:08:50,963 --> 01:08:52,431
(Next is Kwang Soo.)

1896
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:55,000
(He has to have more than those two.)

1897
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,235
I'm looking forward to this.

1898
01:08:56,235 --> 01:08:57,803
He's done.

1899
01:08:58,270 --> 01:08:59,338
Okay.

1900
01:08:59,338 --> 01:09:01,707
(It's filled with black seeds.)

1901
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:04,076
Okay. These are dots.

1902
01:09:04,076 --> 01:09:05,478
(She's shocked.)

1903
01:09:05,745 --> 01:09:07,947
(Dong Il is the last to go.)

1904
01:09:07,947 --> 01:09:09,582
Dong Il.

1905
01:09:09,582 --> 01:09:11,217
(He picked the biggest watermelon. What's the result?)

1906
01:09:11,217 --> 01:09:13,986
(Goodness)

1907
01:09:15,187 --> 01:09:17,890
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... - You have...

1908
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:20,059
- around 10. - There are hardly any. Oh, gosh.

1909
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:21,060
He hardly has any.

1910
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,129
I looked at his and started blushing.

1911
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:26,265
I've never seen one with so few seeds.

1912
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:28,901
- He tapped on it too. - 1, 2, 3, 4...

1913
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,469
You're on TV. Say it properly.

1914
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:33,005
I don't have seeds? I have three kids.

1915
01:09:33,105 --> 01:09:34,640
- No, that's not what I mean. - How dare you...

1916
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,208
call me a seedless watermelon?

1917
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:38,310
- What about my kids? - That's not it.

1918
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:40,479
(Dong Il loses out. It's So Min versus Kwang Soo.)

1919
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,947
Kwang Soo is next.

1920
01:09:42,114 --> 01:09:43,783
28, 29, 30.

1921
01:09:43,783 --> 01:09:44,850
(He has 30 seeds.)

1922
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:45,951
I have 30.

1923
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:47,787
- 30? - I'm winning so far.

1924
01:09:47,787 --> 01:09:48,821
I have 30.

1925
01:09:48,821 --> 01:09:50,556
- Lastly, it's So Min's turn. - Make it fair.

1926
01:09:50,556 --> 01:09:52,024
(He's confident he'll win.)

1927
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,125
I...

1928
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,927
- have too many to count. - 1, 2, 3, 4...

1929
01:09:54,927 --> 01:09:56,762
(For fair play, the director counts.)

1930
01:09:56,829 --> 01:10:00,266
(If So Min loses, they have to play another game.)

1931
01:10:00,466 --> 01:10:03,068
(Counting)

1932
01:10:03,068 --> 01:10:06,439
(28, 29, 30, 31...)

1933
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:08,073
What are you doing?

1934
01:10:08,174 --> 01:10:10,376
(His finger doesn't move with the counting.)

1935
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:13,179
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1936
01:10:13,179 --> 01:10:16,015
I was counting with you. What are you saying?

1937
01:10:16,015 --> 01:10:18,050
- I was counting too. - Let him be.

1938
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,486
You were pointing in the air.

1939
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:22,054
- You can count to 10,000. - Let's see. Count it.

1940
01:10:22,054 --> 01:10:24,056
- I'm serious. Count it. - Count it, Kwang Soo.

1941
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:27,226
(He doesn't trust anything. He starts counting it himself.)

1942
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:28,327
6, 7, 8...

1943
01:10:28,327 --> 01:10:30,963
(Is that necessary?)

1944
01:10:31,297 --> 01:10:33,666
- 25, 26... - 27.

1945
01:10:33,966 --> 01:10:36,535
(He's almost at 30.)

1946
01:10:36,535 --> 01:10:38,537
(He tries to flick one out.)

1947
01:10:38,537 --> 01:10:39,772
Why are you taking it out?

1948
01:10:39,772 --> 01:10:41,207
(He's mad.)

1949
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,975
I have more.

1950
01:10:42,975 --> 01:10:44,477
Besides that, there are three more.

1951
01:10:44,477 --> 01:10:46,445
Yes. I have over 30.

1952
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:48,714
- She has 31. - 31?

1953
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:51,550
It's 31, right?

1954
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:53,586
Yes, it is.

1955
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:55,187
(Good for you.)

1956
01:10:55,187 --> 01:10:58,390
(So Min and Dong Il win 2 to 0. So Min takes another 8.)

1957
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,527
(All teams are done. They go to the last location.)

1958
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:06,665
(Number 8s per member)

1959
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:09,869
There must be a way to turn the tables.

1960
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:12,004
It's been a while since we've been at the ring.

1961
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:14,273
(This is where you get physical. What will they do here?)

1962
01:11:14,273 --> 01:11:15,975
Do we fight?

1963
01:11:15,975 --> 01:11:18,911
It looks like we're fighting in the ring.

1964
01:11:18,944 --> 01:11:21,313
You got your eights, right?

1965
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:22,414
- Yes. - Yes.

1966
01:11:22,414 --> 01:11:25,684
The final mission is going to be held in the octagon.

1967
01:11:25,684 --> 01:11:27,119
- What's this? - This is important.

1968
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:28,454
It's the Eight Colored Shoes Quiz.

1969
01:11:28,454 --> 01:11:30,022
(Final mission: 8 Colored Shoes Quiz)

1970
01:11:30,022 --> 01:11:31,223
- What? - Is it a quiz?

1971
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:33,292
- I'm in trouble. - "Eight colored shoes"?

1972
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,060
You'll put on shoes of eight different colors...

1973
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:37,062
and solve quizzes that have to do with the number eight.

1974
01:11:37,062 --> 01:11:38,531
Okay.

1975
01:11:38,631 --> 01:11:41,634
The buzzer is the shoe that a staff member picks.

1976
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:45,938
A member who puts the shoe in this basket first gets a chance.

1977
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:49,875
If you get your shoe stolen, you can stand by the whip cream cannon.

1978
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,777
If it's the right answer,

1979
01:11:51,777 --> 01:11:54,280
the person who got their shoe stolen gets the penalty.

1980
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,616
If you say the wrong answer, you get the penalty.

1981
01:11:57,983 --> 01:11:59,552
Goodness.

1982
01:11:59,552 --> 01:12:01,053
If you get a question right,

1983
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:03,389
you can take as many number eights...

1984
01:12:03,389 --> 01:12:05,558
from a member's bag.

1985
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:07,026
- As many as you want? - Yes.

1986
01:12:07,026 --> 01:12:08,294
Is that good?

1987
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:09,328
You're right.

1988
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:13,065
The 1st 3 people to collect 8 number 8s...

1989
01:12:13,065 --> 01:12:14,867
move onto the final round.

1990
01:12:14,867 --> 01:12:20,372
(The 1st 3 people to collect 8 number 8s, move on.)

1991
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:22,174
This is so...

1992
01:12:22,174 --> 01:12:24,109
- This is the end. - Let me move onto the final round.

1993
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:25,311
But they ask you...

1994
01:12:25,311 --> 01:12:27,212
- random questions. - I know.

1995
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,213
- They ask you ridiculous questions. - I know.

1996
01:12:28,213 --> 01:12:29,715
They're too difficult.

1997
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:31,917
Who knows that a toilet is a swan?

1998
01:12:31,917 --> 01:12:33,886
No, it's a pony. It's "bidet".

1999
01:12:33,886 --> 01:12:36,889
Be quiet.

2000
01:12:37,156 --> 01:12:38,457
- Why are you mad? - Why are you...

2001
01:12:38,457 --> 01:12:40,492
- doing that to her? - Stop it.

2002
01:12:40,593 --> 01:12:41,961
She could've just moved on.

2003
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:44,697
She gave him the correct information and he got mad. He almost hit her.

2004
01:12:44,697 --> 01:12:47,333
I smelled something sweet.

2005
01:12:48,434 --> 01:12:49,935
Be quiet.

2006
01:12:49,935 --> 01:12:52,671
- I smelled honey. - This is funny.

2007
01:12:52,671 --> 01:12:54,139
"Be quiet."

2008
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:57,543
(Everyone has picked their shoes.)

2009
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:00,679
It's all about who takes your shoe,

2010
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:03,215
so it's better to get it taken by people who are bad in quizzes.

2011
01:13:03,215 --> 01:13:05,384
(This is Jae Seok's tip.)

2012
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:08,821
(He finds a good spot.)

2013
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:11,790
(Let's do this together, idiots.)

2014
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,225
Wait.

2015
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:15,995
In a row?

2016
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:17,663
- Thank you. - You know what?

2017
01:13:17,663 --> 01:13:18,964
She got them all right before.

2018
01:13:18,964 --> 01:13:20,566
She's the queen of quizzes.

2019
01:13:20,799 --> 01:13:21,867
- She's the best. - She's the queen of quizzes.

2020
01:13:21,867 --> 01:13:24,103
- Here's the first question. - Okay.

2021
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:31,777
To commemorate the hosting of 1988 Seoul Olympics,

2022
01:13:31,844 --> 01:13:37,082
Olympic Expressway was named. Where does it not pass?

2023
01:13:38,684 --> 01:13:40,619
- Jae Seok has to know this. - 1988?

2024
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:42,221
- I don't know. - You know too, right?

2025
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:43,522
- I know 100 percent. - I have to see.

2026
01:13:43,522 --> 01:13:45,658
Number one, "Seoul".

2027
01:13:45,724 --> 01:13:47,393
Number two, "Daegu".

2028
01:13:47,393 --> 01:13:49,194
Number three, "Damyang".

2029
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:50,896
Number four, "Namwon".

2030
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:53,032
- I got it. - I know too.

2031
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,833
- This is hard. - I don't know.

2032
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,169
The buzzer for this question is...

2033
01:13:57,169 --> 01:14:03,876
(What's the shoe color for this question?)

2034
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:05,544
- I think it's blue. - It's purple.

2035
01:14:06,111 --> 01:14:07,479
Who's purple?

2036
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:08,814
- It's Ji Hyo. - Come here.

2037
01:14:08,814 --> 01:14:10,049
Who's purple?

2038
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:11,250
- It's Ji Hyo. - Come here.

2039
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:14,853
(People are going after Ji Hyo.)

2040
01:14:14,853 --> 01:14:16,355
How far is she going?

2041
01:14:16,789 --> 01:14:18,857
- How far is she going? - Don't go there.

2042
01:14:18,857 --> 01:14:20,125
Ji Hyo.

2043
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,027
(She's faster than others and different from them.)

2044
01:14:22,027 --> 01:14:24,229
(Grabbing)

2045
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,331
Take it from her.

2046
01:14:26,331 --> 01:14:27,666
(She gets away.)

2047
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:30,002
(She avoids Kwang Soo's attack.)

2048
01:14:30,002 --> 01:14:31,637
Take it from her.

2049
01:14:31,704 --> 01:14:35,374
(But a dangerous insect snatches it.)

2050
01:14:35,874 --> 01:14:38,143
(He touches down.)

2051
01:14:38,143 --> 01:14:39,745
- I got it. - I did it.

2052
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:40,746
He took it out.

2053
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:41,947
That was so...

2054
01:14:41,947 --> 01:14:43,182
Fine, I got it.

2055
01:14:43,182 --> 01:14:45,651
(She's enraged.)

2056
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:46,885
(They've heard that tone of voice before.)

2057
01:14:46,885 --> 01:14:48,554
That's my voice. Okay?

2058
01:14:48,554 --> 01:14:49,855
- Fine, let's do this. - All right.

2059
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,090
- Ji Hyo. - Let's do this. Okay.

2060
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,758
- You have to come here. - Okay.

2061
01:14:52,758 --> 01:14:55,160
(I get that you're angry, but can you come to the front?)

2062
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,495
Okay.

2063
01:14:56,495 --> 01:14:57,629
Get it wrong, Jae Seok.

2064
01:14:57,629 --> 01:14:58,697
I have no chance.

2065
01:14:58,697 --> 01:15:00,099
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

2066
01:15:00,132 --> 01:15:03,235
number one, "Seoul".

2067
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:05,771
(It was to commemorate the Seoul Olympics, and that's the answer?)

2068
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:07,606
- It doesn't pass Seoul? - He's wrong.

2069
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,441
(What city does Olympic Expressway not pass?)

2070
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:11,744
(Number 1, "Seoul" is correct.)

2071
01:15:11,744 --> 01:15:13,479
- It's Seoul? - Is it?

2072
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,515
- It's Seoul? - Is it?

2073
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:19,485
(She's even more mad.)

2074
01:15:19,485 --> 01:15:20,853
It's east to west.

2075
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:23,288
- It connects east and west. - Isn't it Namwon?

2076
01:15:23,288 --> 01:15:24,423
No.

2077
01:15:24,423 --> 01:15:27,159
How could it not pass Seoul when it's for the Seoul Olympics?

2078
01:15:27,159 --> 01:15:30,796
Jae Seok, you got it right, so you can pick a member's bag...

2079
01:15:30,796 --> 01:15:33,265
and take as many number eights as you want.

2080
01:15:33,265 --> 01:15:36,502
- As many as I want? - Which member do you pick?

2081
01:15:36,502 --> 01:15:38,437
You have to pick the person with many number eights.

2082
01:15:38,437 --> 01:15:40,072
I can't...

2083
01:15:40,072 --> 01:15:42,407
really pick anybody,

2084
01:15:42,407 --> 01:15:44,510
so be honest and tell me how many you have.

2085
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:47,846
You have to be honest.

2086
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:49,648
(Look at his face.)

2087
01:15:49,648 --> 01:15:51,049
I'll tell you.

2088
01:15:51,583 --> 01:15:54,186
Let me tell you this.

2089
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:58,123
- Be honest, and I'll exclude you. - Okay.

2090
01:15:58,123 --> 01:16:00,259
(He'll give leeway to those who are honest.)

2091
01:16:00,259 --> 01:16:02,161
(Whispering)

2092
01:16:02,161 --> 01:16:03,929
Zero?

2093
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:06,632
It was 1, 3, or 5.

2094
01:16:06,632 --> 01:16:07,900
You have zero?

2095
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,568
- You can't have zero. - That's true.

2096
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:12,604
I'll take yours.

2097
01:16:12,604 --> 01:16:13,705
His?

2098
01:16:13,705 --> 01:16:15,474
- You can't have zero. - He can't.

2099
01:16:15,474 --> 01:16:17,309
Why is he saying he has zero?

2100
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:18,544
I'm serious. I have zero.

2101
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:20,946
- I have none. - That's not possible.

2102
01:16:20,946 --> 01:16:23,482
You can look in the bag and take as many as you want.

2103
01:16:23,782 --> 01:16:25,050
Does he get to look?

2104
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:26,385
Kwang Soo...

2105
01:16:26,385 --> 01:16:28,420
- Does he get to look? - Yes.

2106
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,022
He said he had zero.

2107
01:16:30,022 --> 01:16:32,524
- Zero? - I don't think it's true.

2108
01:16:32,524 --> 01:16:35,060
(Kwang Soo is flustered. How many 8s does he have?)

2109
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,563
- Does he really have zero? - Take as many as you want.

2110
01:16:39,131 --> 01:16:41,567
Let's move onto the next question.

2111
01:16:41,567 --> 01:16:43,468
(Let's move onto the next question.)

2112
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,204
- I think he has none. - He does?

2113
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:47,406
- Really? - Does he have zero?

2114
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:49,241
- Why? - Really?

2115
01:16:49,241 --> 01:16:50,709
You really have none?

2116
01:16:51,677 --> 01:16:53,412
Let's ask a question about ourselves.

2117
01:16:53,412 --> 01:16:54,513
Okay.

2118
01:16:54,513 --> 01:16:56,448
Guess what my mom's blood type is.

2119
01:16:56,548 --> 01:16:58,350
If I lose, I'm going home.

2120
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,018
(They bet an eight and guessed each other's mom's blood type.)

2121
01:17:00,052 --> 01:17:01,119
1, 2, 3.

2122
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:02,154
- Blood type O. - Blood type O.

2123
01:17:02,154 --> 01:17:03,255
1, 2, 3.

2124
01:17:03,255 --> 01:17:04,389
- Blood type B. - Blood type O.

2125
01:17:04,389 --> 01:17:05,791
I got it.

2126
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:08,594
Give it to me. Hurry up. Give it to me.

2127
01:17:08,594 --> 01:17:09,928
B?

2128
01:17:10,329 --> 01:17:12,431
I have five now.

2129
01:17:12,431 --> 01:17:14,066
(He only had one, but he got it taken away.)

2130
01:17:14,066 --> 01:17:16,568
(Sighing)

2131
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:19,738
- Goodness. - He had zero?

2132
01:17:20,072 --> 01:17:21,740
How can he have none?

2133
01:17:22,474 --> 01:17:24,676
- Here's the question. - Is this a riddle?

2134
01:17:24,676 --> 01:17:26,879
- You have a good chance. - Okay.

2135
01:17:26,879 --> 01:17:31,750
Which song won the Grand Award in 1988 Gangbyeon Song Festival...

2136
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,052
that was held in August?

2137
01:17:34,052 --> 01:17:36,054
- 1988? - Grand Award?

2138
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:39,625
Number one, "Love Like a Sad Picture" by Lee Sang Woo.

2139
01:17:39,725 --> 01:17:43,195
Number two, "Always Think of You" by Lee Sun Hee.

2140
01:17:43,195 --> 01:17:46,398
Number three, "Damdadi" by Lee Sang Eun.

2141
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:49,201
Number four, "Is There Anybody?" by Han Young Ae.

2142
01:17:49,201 --> 01:17:50,569
- I know this. - I got it.

2143
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:52,004
(Which song won the 1988 Gangbyeon Song Festival?)

2144
01:17:52,004 --> 01:17:53,372
(The older members are excited.)

2145
01:17:53,372 --> 01:17:55,641
- I know this. - You do?

2146
01:17:55,641 --> 01:17:57,643
- I'm certain. - The buzzer is...

2147
01:17:58,043 --> 01:17:59,111
blue.

2148
01:17:59,111 --> 01:18:00,512
(It's Jae Seok.)

2149
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:01,580
It's him.

2150
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,049
(It's him.)

2151
01:18:04,383 --> 01:18:05,817
Take it from him. Hurry.

2152
01:18:05,817 --> 01:18:07,185
(He does a tap dance to escape.)

2153
01:18:07,185 --> 01:18:08,654
Take it.

2154
01:18:08,654 --> 01:18:09,922
Take it from him. Give it to me.

2155
01:18:09,922 --> 01:18:12,357
Give it to me.

2156
01:18:12,357 --> 01:18:13,859
(Kwang Soo steals it and touches down.)

2157
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:16,194
- I had it. - No, no.

2158
01:18:16,194 --> 01:18:17,796
(Which song won the 1988 Gangbyeon Song Festival?)

2159
01:18:17,796 --> 01:18:18,864
Did you know?

2160
01:18:18,864 --> 01:18:21,733
I tried not to get it taken by Seok Jin.

2161
01:18:21,733 --> 01:18:24,102
- I know this for sure. - Kwang Soo doesn't.

2162
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:25,871
He was born in 1985.

2163
01:18:25,871 --> 01:18:27,339
He was four years old.

2164
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:29,408
I think it's number 2 or 3.

2165
01:18:29,408 --> 01:18:31,877
- You were three. - What's the answer?

2166
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:34,212
- That's not your real age. - Do you want me to tell you?

2167
01:18:34,212 --> 01:18:35,814
Should I tell you?

2168
01:18:38,216 --> 01:18:40,519
(It's number 1.)

2169
01:18:40,919 --> 01:18:42,220
What's the answer?

2170
01:18:42,220 --> 01:18:44,923
This is a mental game. Seok Jin swayed you.

2171
01:18:44,923 --> 01:18:46,291
(Go with number 1.)

2172
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:47,793
What's the answer?

2173
01:18:50,963 --> 01:18:54,232
Number three, "Damdadi" by Lee Sang Eun.

2174
01:18:54,232 --> 01:18:55,701
(He goes with his gut.)

2175
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:58,270
(Did he just ignore me?)

2176
01:18:59,137 --> 01:19:00,205
What?

2177
01:19:00,205 --> 01:19:01,473
Okay!

2178
01:19:01,473 --> 01:19:05,344
(Number three, "Damdadi" is correct.)

2179
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,112
I knew.

2180
01:19:07,112 --> 01:19:09,314
This is the right answer.

2181
01:19:09,648 --> 01:19:11,149
- Because... - "Damdadi".

2182
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:13,485
- It's correct. - Were you in the song festival?

2183
01:19:13,485 --> 01:19:14,987
I haven't even seen it.

2184
01:19:14,987 --> 01:19:17,456
- He could have been on it. - I don't even know what it is.

2185
01:19:17,556 --> 01:19:19,925
I heard he was born in 1958, not 1985.

2186
01:19:19,925 --> 01:19:21,626
- 1958? The year of the dog. - What are you saying?

2187
01:19:21,626 --> 01:19:23,261
Kwang Soo, you got it right.

2188
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:24,396
- Yes. - That was so close.

2189
01:19:24,396 --> 01:19:26,999
You can pick a member's bag and take as many eights as you want.

2190
01:19:26,999 --> 01:19:28,333
That was so close.

2191
01:19:28,834 --> 01:19:29,835
Can I just say it?

2192
01:19:29,835 --> 01:19:30,936
I'm going to kill you.

2193
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:32,904
- I want to take So Min's bag... - I'm going to kill you.

2194
01:19:32,904 --> 01:19:34,873
(He picks So Min's bag without hesitating.)

2195
01:19:34,873 --> 01:19:36,108
- Why? - Hey!

2196
01:19:36,108 --> 01:19:38,210
That's not what we said.

2197
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:41,613
- I want to take So Min's bag... - Hold on. Come here.

2198
01:19:41,947 --> 01:19:43,448
- I'll take five. - What?

2199
01:19:43,448 --> 01:19:44,883
- 5? - She has 5.

2200
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:47,586
(She had 5?)

2201
01:19:47,586 --> 01:19:48,687
Is that possible?

2202
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:50,322
- Hey. - She has five?

2203
01:19:50,322 --> 01:19:52,924
- Then So Min has zero, - Oh, gosh.

2204
01:19:52,924 --> 01:19:54,292
- and Kwang Soo has five. - Oh, gosh.

2205
01:19:54,292 --> 01:19:55,727
- Here's question three. - Okay.

2206
01:19:55,727 --> 01:19:57,429
Get ready.

2207
01:19:57,429 --> 01:19:59,097
- Oh, gosh. - My bad.

2208
01:19:59,097 --> 01:20:01,033
Here's the third question.

2209
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:03,201
Out of all the kings in Joseon...

2210
01:20:03,201 --> 01:20:06,104
(Goodness)

2211
01:20:06,104 --> 01:20:07,105
(They give up.)

2212
01:20:07,105 --> 01:20:08,740
I...

2213
01:20:09,341 --> 01:20:11,843
A few people should be sitting down.

2214
01:20:12,811 --> 01:20:14,312
You never know. They could be in movies.

2215
01:20:14,312 --> 01:20:16,982
- Sit down, Ji Hyo. - Oh, gosh.

2216
01:20:16,982 --> 01:20:18,817
(I'll stand back up when I have to get physical.)

2217
01:20:18,817 --> 01:20:20,152
Come on.

2218
01:20:20,619 --> 01:20:23,121
Out of all the kings in Joseon,

2219
01:20:23,121 --> 01:20:25,524
who's the eighth king?

2220
01:20:25,524 --> 01:20:28,827
- I only know up to seventh. - Hold on.

2221
01:20:28,827 --> 01:20:30,328
Rat, cow, tiger, rabbit...

2222
01:20:30,328 --> 01:20:33,398
(He's serious.)

2223
01:20:33,398 --> 01:20:35,067
What are you talking about?

2224
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:36,468
What are you talking about?

2225
01:20:36,468 --> 01:20:38,904
- What are you talking about? - What is it?

2226
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:40,972
(He's incredible.)

2227
01:20:40,972 --> 01:20:42,707
Number one,

2228
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:46,078
"Taejo". Number two, "Sejo".

2229
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:48,146
Number three, "Yejong".

2230
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:49,881
Number four, "Yeonsangun".

2231
01:20:49,881 --> 01:20:50,982
Okay.

2232
01:20:50,982 --> 01:20:52,551
The buzzer is...

2233
01:20:52,551 --> 01:20:53,685
green.

2234
01:20:53,685 --> 01:20:55,587
(It's So Min.)

2235
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:56,755
It's green.

2236
01:20:56,755 --> 01:20:59,591
I'm sorry.

2237
01:20:59,591 --> 01:21:02,094
(It's a chaos.)

2238
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:05,764
(As soon as Kwang Soo picks it up, they run like piranhas.)

2239
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:08,700
(Where did Jong Kook come from?)

2240
01:21:09,267 --> 01:21:11,403
(The herbivores may fight, but Jong Kook always wins.)

2241
01:21:11,403 --> 01:21:12,471
Goodness.

2242
01:21:12,471 --> 01:21:14,906
We don't know the answer, and we're weak too.

2243
01:21:14,906 --> 01:21:17,042
Jong Kook went for it.

2244
01:21:17,042 --> 01:21:19,277
I thought this was the Super Bowl.

2245
01:21:19,277 --> 01:21:22,013
- What's the answer? - It's number three, "Yejong".

2246
01:21:22,013 --> 01:21:23,248
(He's confident.)

2247
01:21:23,248 --> 01:21:24,916
(Is it the answer?)

2248
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:27,752
(Jong Kook is correct.)

2249
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:28,753
That was strong.

2250
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:29,821
Yes!

2251
01:21:29,821 --> 01:21:31,523
It was Yejong?

2252
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,391
(For your information, this is So Min.)

2253
01:21:33,391 --> 01:21:34,726
I...

2254
01:21:34,926 --> 01:21:37,095
I got my number eights taken away,

2255
01:21:37,362 --> 01:21:38,730
and I have whip cream on my face.

2256
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,699
- Look at the cream. - Can I have some bread?

2257
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:42,300
(Can we dip it in bread?)

2258
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,302
(She wipes off the whip cream and reflects on the day.)

2259
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:45,804
There's so much whip cream.

2260
01:21:45,804 --> 01:21:47,506
It's your fault.

2261
01:21:47,506 --> 01:21:48,840
(It's your fault, Kwang Soo.)

2262
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:49,908
How's this my fault?

2263
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:52,644
Taejo, Jeongjong, Taejong, Sejong, Munjong, Danjong, Sejo...

2264
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:53,912
That's right.

2265
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:57,516
Jong Kook, pick a person and take as many as you want.

2266
01:21:57,516 --> 01:21:59,217
Then Kwang Soo...

2267
01:21:59,217 --> 01:22:00,819
(It's obvious.)

2268
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:02,320
It's obvious.

2269
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,823
- It's obvious. - Jae Seok...

2270
01:22:04,856 --> 01:22:06,558
He took five, right?

2271
01:22:06,558 --> 01:22:08,894
- It's obvious. - He took five.

2272
01:22:08,894 --> 01:22:10,061
Hold on.

2273
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:11,663
- Listen to me. - Wait.

2274
01:22:11,663 --> 01:22:13,198
Give me a minute. Okay.

2275
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:15,200
- I have five, but... - Fine. I'll think about it.

2276
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,702
- If you had 4, - He has 4.

2277
01:22:17,702 --> 01:22:19,070
Whose would you take?

2278
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,505
I would have taken mine, but...

2279
01:22:20,505 --> 01:22:22,207
(He can't deny it.)

2280
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,843
(It makes sense to take Kwang Soo's.)

2281
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:27,279
You have to see which two people move on.

2282
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:28,813
I'll take Kwang Soo's then.

2283
01:22:28,813 --> 01:22:30,615
(Is that right?)

2284
01:22:30,615 --> 01:22:32,117
That's right.

2285
01:22:32,284 --> 01:22:33,852
I'll take four.

2286
01:22:33,852 --> 01:22:36,721
It's obvious. There's no point talking.

2287
01:22:36,755 --> 01:22:38,390
Jong Kook, you move onto the final round.

2288
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:39,524
Okay.

2289
01:22:39,524 --> 01:22:40,559
(With 4 more, Jong Kook gets 8 8s and moves on.)

2290
01:22:40,559 --> 01:22:41,593
That was good.

2291
01:22:41,593 --> 01:22:44,829
I was waiting for it, and there was one question I knew.

2292
01:22:44,863 --> 01:22:46,164
I got it.

2293
01:22:46,164 --> 01:22:48,033
Answer. Number three, "Never Go Back".

2294
01:22:48,033 --> 01:22:49,801
This isn't it. I swear.

2295
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:51,970
(Haha said it wasn't right, but Jae Seok was correct.)

2296
01:22:51,970 --> 01:22:53,104
I'll take two.

2297
01:22:53,104 --> 01:22:54,906
- Did he have that many? - Really?

2298
01:22:55,006 --> 01:22:58,743
(Se Chan miraculously answers a question right.)

2299
01:22:58,743 --> 01:23:00,078
Okay!

2300
01:23:00,212 --> 01:23:01,279
Come on.

2301
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:03,481
(Jong Kook, Se Chan, and Jae Seok are in the final round.)

2302
01:23:03,481 --> 01:23:06,051
This is the final round.

2303
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:08,853
It's My Four Line Fate.

2304
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:10,455
(Final round: My Four Line Fate)

2305
01:23:10,455 --> 01:23:13,391
This is a bomb quiz.

2306
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:14,392
Is it a quiz again?

2307
01:23:14,392 --> 01:23:17,195
There are four lines attached to a bomb.

2308
01:23:17,195 --> 01:23:21,299
There are 3 correct lines, and 1 incorrect line.

2309
01:23:21,733 --> 01:23:23,468
Listen to the question,

2310
01:23:23,668 --> 01:23:27,339
and you'll cut the correct lines one by one.

2311
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,608
If you cut the incorrect line,

2312
01:23:29,608 --> 01:23:31,276
the bomb will explode.

2313
01:23:31,576 --> 01:23:33,812
That person is eliminated immediately.

2314
01:23:33,812 --> 01:23:34,813
(If you cut the incorrect line, you're eliminated immediately.)

2315
01:23:34,813 --> 01:23:38,083
The last person remaining becomes the winner.

2316
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,718
This sounds fun.

2317
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:42,654
Please pick the order.

2318
01:23:42,654 --> 01:23:45,624
Is there no lighting for the remaining people?

2319
01:23:45,624 --> 01:23:47,692
(An unprecedented question)

2320
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,894
(They're already sad because they are out.)

2321
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:52,230
- This is too dark. - Am I on TV?

2322
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,832
Be quiet!

2323
01:23:53,832 --> 01:23:55,834
The main characters are on TV.

2324
01:23:55,834 --> 01:23:57,002
(Be quiet.)

2325
01:23:57,002 --> 01:23:58,403
What was that?

2326
01:23:58,403 --> 01:23:59,771
(The lights come back on for the losers.)

2327
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:02,274
- What's this? - We're the main ones.

2328
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:04,776
- Turn it off. - This is not intense anymore.

2329
01:24:04,776 --> 01:24:07,746
Focus on us. It was good earlier.

2330
01:24:07,746 --> 01:24:10,649
- Our faces don't show. - Be quiet!

2331
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:11,716
Keep your mouth shut!

2332
01:24:11,716 --> 01:24:13,084
Our face doesn't show.

2333
01:24:13,084 --> 01:24:14,619
(He's strict.)

2334
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:16,554
(Keep your mouth shut!)

2335
01:24:16,554 --> 01:24:18,690
- "Keep your mouth shut." - Keep it shut.

2336
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:19,991
Keep it shut.

2337
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:21,660
Be quiet.

2338
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:23,428
- Jong Kook. - Keep it shut.

2339
01:24:23,662 --> 01:24:25,063
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

2340
01:24:25,063 --> 01:24:28,066
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2341
01:24:28,333 --> 01:24:29,467
(Jae Seok loses.)

2342
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:31,636
You're going last.

2343
01:24:31,636 --> 01:24:32,971
- Rock-paper-scissors - Okay.

2344
01:24:32,971 --> 01:24:34,639
(Se Chan is 1st.)

2345
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,408
(This is the first question. He gets to decide who goes first.)

2346
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:38,376
If you look at the probability, I should go first.

2347
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:39,911
I'll go first.

2348
01:24:40,011 --> 01:24:42,213
Jae Seok will go second,

2349
01:24:42,213 --> 01:24:43,481
and Jong Kook will go third.

2350
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:47,152
(You have to survive until the end. Who will be the winner?)

2351
01:24:47,285 --> 01:24:48,386
Here's the question.

2352
01:24:48,386 --> 01:24:51,656
In August 1998...

2353
01:24:51,656 --> 01:24:52,924
August?

2354
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:56,928
Which song won first place in "Inkigayo"?

2355
01:24:56,928 --> 01:24:58,663
Hold on. What year again? 1998?

2356
01:24:58,663 --> 01:24:59,831
1998?

2357
01:24:59,831 --> 01:25:01,700
Jong Kook has the advantage.

2358
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:03,234
- Okay. - This was...

2359
01:25:03,234 --> 01:25:04,703
- when he was active. - Okay, 1998.

2360
01:25:04,703 --> 01:25:07,739
Number one, "To My Boyfriend" by Fin.K.L.

2361
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:10,975
Number two, "Breakup with Her"  by Kim Hyun Jung.

2362
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:13,912
Number three, "Good Love" by Kim Min Jong.

2363
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:16,715
Number four, "Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies.

2364
01:25:16,715 --> 01:25:19,417
- I have no idea. - They all got first place.

2365
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,052
I don't know.

2366
01:25:21,052 --> 01:25:22,320
I have no idea.

2367
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,389
You have to go with...

2368
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:26,691
people's inclination back then.

2369
01:25:26,691 --> 01:25:28,460
Let's go. Hurry, everybody.

2370
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,527
(Se Chan gets to go first.)

2371
01:25:29,527 --> 01:25:31,396
- Let's go. - I don't know.

2372
01:25:31,796 --> 01:25:33,765
This is hard. I don't remember.

2373
01:25:34,733 --> 01:25:35,834
Pick the most popular one.

2374
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:38,636
Number two, "Breakup with Her" by Kim Hyun Jung.

2375
01:25:38,636 --> 01:25:39,838
(After some thinking, )

2376
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:41,873
(he picks number 2. He has to cut the line.)

2377
01:25:41,873 --> 01:25:43,408
You have to guess.

2378
01:25:44,509 --> 01:25:46,911
1, 2, 3.

2379
01:25:46,911 --> 01:25:50,148
(If it's right, nothing will happen. If it's not, the bomb will explode.)

2380
01:25:50,515 --> 01:25:51,750
(Cutting)

2381
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:52,751
Okay.

2382
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,785
(Number 2 is correct. Se Chan survives.)

2383
01:25:53,785 --> 01:25:55,019
("Breakup with Her" got 1st place on August 9, 1998.)

2384
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:56,454
- Is he right? - Is he?

2385
01:25:57,222 --> 01:25:59,991
(I knew it.)

2386
01:26:00,091 --> 01:26:01,626
It's for August, right?

2387
01:26:01,626 --> 01:26:04,095
There's an advantage for people in my age group.

2388
01:26:05,063 --> 01:26:06,464
I have no idea.

2389
01:26:06,464 --> 01:26:07,665
I know the wrong answer.

2390
01:26:07,665 --> 01:26:10,568
I don't know if "Good Love" was in August 1998.

2391
01:26:10,568 --> 01:26:12,771
No, it was from that time,

2392
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:15,206
but there's a song that didn't win first place.

2393
01:26:15,206 --> 01:26:16,875
Don't ballads...

2394
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,410
usually get released in autumn and winter?

2395
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,011
I'll go with the one I'm certain about.

2396
01:26:20,011 --> 01:26:21,913
It got first place for sure. "To My Boyfriend".

2397
01:26:21,913 --> 01:26:24,115
(It has to be 1st place.)

2398
01:26:24,115 --> 01:26:25,650
- It has to be. - I don't know if it's that time.

2399
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,018
That I'm not sure.

2400
01:26:27,152 --> 01:26:28,987
- I don't know. - Number one,

2401
01:26:28,987 --> 01:26:30,989
- "To My Boyfriend" by Fin.K.L. - It's the most famous.

2402
01:26:31,122 --> 01:26:34,159
1, 2, 3.

2403
01:26:35,393 --> 01:26:36,628
(Cutting)

2404
01:26:36,628 --> 01:26:38,062
It's wrong.

2405
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:41,666
("To My Boyfriend" won 1st place in September 1998.)

2406
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,302
(That's not it?)

2407
01:26:44,302 --> 01:26:45,770
- This is not it? - It's not.

2408
01:26:45,837 --> 01:26:47,739
- Yes. - This wasn't it?

2409
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:50,175
Good thing I went last.

2410
01:26:50,175 --> 01:26:52,710
- President of my fan club! - Yes, sir!

2411
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:54,612
That wasn't it.

2412
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:56,514
(He leaves the star and the president of his fan club.)

2413
01:26:56,514 --> 01:26:57,582
Okay.

2414
01:26:57,582 --> 01:26:58,917
Se Chan, what's going on?

2415
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,151
Let's win.

2416
01:27:00,151 --> 01:27:01,219
(The winner is 1 of these 2.)

2417
01:27:01,219 --> 01:27:03,822
(Se Chan is the 1st candidate.)

2418
01:27:03,822 --> 01:27:07,125
(He doesn't think about his bucktooth. He's daring.)

2419
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:09,060
(He was being annoying and picked out all the weaknesses...)

2420
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,863
(of the members in 7 People Profile.)

2421
01:27:11,863 --> 01:27:13,431
Why am I a grandpa?

2422
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:14,566
Okay.

2423
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:16,935
(Jong Kook is the 2nd candidate.)

2424
01:27:16,935 --> 01:27:19,103
(He thought Haha got a new identity.)

2425
01:27:19,103 --> 01:27:21,806
(His idea of members' profiles were absurd but truthful.)

2426
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:24,776
- He's my fan. - He's a big fan.

2427
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:26,744
- Here it is. - Okay.

2428
01:27:26,744 --> 01:27:31,382
Which incidents happened in 1998?

2429
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:34,953
Number one, "France wins the World Cup".

2430
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:39,190
Number two, "First visit to Mount Geumgang after the division".

2431
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:42,160
Number three, "'Titanic' is released in Korea".

2432
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,796
Number four, "g.o.d's debut".

2433
01:27:44,996 --> 01:27:46,564
1998?

2434
01:27:47,098 --> 01:27:48,333
I'll go.

2435
01:27:48,333 --> 01:27:50,301
Number one, "France wins the World Cup".

2436
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:51,836
(He goes for the most obvious one.)

2437
01:27:51,836 --> 01:27:52,904
(That's for sure.)

2438
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:54,739
1, 2, 3.

2439
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,443
(Number 1 is correct.)

2440
01:27:58,843 --> 01:28:01,145
- It's right. - That's for sure.

2441
01:28:02,847 --> 01:28:04,349
I'll go with number two.

2442
01:28:04,349 --> 01:28:05,817
"First visit to Mount Geumgang after the division".

2443
01:28:05,817 --> 01:28:07,285
What?

2444
01:28:07,585 --> 01:28:09,888
- Okay. - All right. One...

2445
01:28:09,888 --> 01:28:12,524
(Did the 1st visit to Mount Geumgang after the division happen in 1998?)

2446
01:28:12,524 --> 01:28:15,527
(If it's incorrect, Se Chan will win.)

2447
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:18,296
(Is the 2nd multiple choice the right answer?)

2448
01:28:18,296 --> 01:28:20,131
- 2, 3. Look. - I think it'll explode.

2449
01:28:20,131 --> 01:28:21,232
It didn't go off.

2450
01:28:21,232 --> 01:28:22,233
I think it'll explode.

2451
01:28:22,233 --> 01:28:24,235
(The 1st visit to the mountain took place in November, 1998.)

2452
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:27,505
The second one's the only one not related to entertainment.

2453
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:29,040
That's too hard.

2454
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,174
(Now, the correct answer is either the 3rd or 4th choice.)

2455
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:31,409
I have no idea.

2456
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:34,412
(If Se Chan gets it wrong, Jong Kook will win.)

2457
01:28:35,213 --> 01:28:36,247
(If not, they'll solve another problem.)

2458
01:28:36,247 --> 01:28:37,815
- I have decided. - Go ahead.

2459
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:39,784
I'll go with number four, g.o.d's debut.

2460
01:28:40,685 --> 01:28:43,288
(Se Chan chooses number four.)

2461
01:28:43,888 --> 01:28:45,290
- I think he's right. - This is the right answer.

2462
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,958
- You think so too, right? - This is the correct one.

2463
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:47,959
(Is it correct or incorrect?)

2464
01:28:47,959 --> 01:28:49,827
1, 2, 3.

2465
01:28:50,862 --> 01:28:53,364
(The 4th multiple choice is wrong.)

2466
01:28:53,398 --> 01:28:54,532
- That was wrong? - Hey.

2467
01:28:54,532 --> 01:28:56,134
(The group debuted in 1999.)

2468
01:28:56,768 --> 01:28:58,770
(Hey, did I just win?)

2469
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,572
- Did I win the whole thing? - He won.

2470
01:29:00,939 --> 01:29:04,542
All right. Today's race's victory goes to Jong Kook.

2471
01:29:04,542 --> 01:29:06,311
(Jong Kook will get to change their online profiles.)

2472
01:29:06,311 --> 01:29:09,614
I haven't won for a long time. I didn't expect anything, but I won.

2473
01:29:09,614 --> 01:29:12,584
- I'll consider your opinions. - Give that to me.

2474
01:29:12,584 --> 01:29:14,118
It won't be just my idea.

2475
01:29:14,118 --> 01:29:15,420
Sir, here you go.

2476
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,221
- It has started again. - Mr. Kim Jong Kook.

2477
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:19,223
- Do you need anything? - I see.

2478
01:29:19,223 --> 01:29:22,060
- All right. Okay. - Are you all right?

2479
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:24,028
- Excuse me, Mr. Kim. - Okay.

2480
01:29:24,028 --> 01:29:25,930
- Let's have naengmyeon together. - What?

2481
01:29:25,930 --> 01:29:27,332
- What? - Let's get naengmyeon.

2482
01:29:27,332 --> 01:29:29,901
(Profiles on other search engines will change after screening.)

2483
01:29:29,901 --> 01:29:31,836
(Yes, it's summer!)

2484
01:29:32,036 --> 01:29:33,571
(They go on a summer vacation.)

2485
01:29:33,605 --> 01:29:36,474
(And queens of vacations will join.)

2486
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:38,076
(Jennie, a queen with endless charms)

2487
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:40,745
(Jin Ki Joo, multi-talented beauty)

2488
01:29:40,979 --> 01:29:43,948
(Okay! It's a real vacation!)

2489
01:29:44,349 --> 01:29:45,583
(However, )

2490
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:48,720
(the biggest heat wave hits Korea.)

2491
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:52,390
(On the day of their vacation, the heat wave strikes.)

2492
01:29:53,658 --> 01:29:56,561
(But we're with the queens of vacations.)

2493
01:29:56,561 --> 01:29:59,464
(These ladies don't spare themselves.)

2494
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:01,933
(Thanks to their effort, the laughter cools down the heat.)

2495
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,069
(Everything will be decided by these unlucky hands.)

2496
01:30:05,403 --> 01:30:07,639
(Vacation to blow away the heat wave)

2497
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:09,374
(What's wrong with Jennie?)

2498
01:30:10,942 --> 01:30:12,877
(What is this? This feels nasty.)

2499
01:30:12,944 --> 01:30:14,779
(Unlucky Vacation)
