1
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:08,090
(One day in August)

2
00:00:08,098 --> 00:00:10,500
(Sampe Jigu, Han River)

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,425
(A special race awaits the members.)

4
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:16,365
(Knocking)

5
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:21,910
(He is already on his guard.)

6
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,910
(Before the shoot begins,)

7
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:24,140
What is it?

8
00:00:24,147 --> 00:00:25,280
(Jae Seok gets a questionnaire.)

9
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:27,280
- Please fill it out. - What?

10
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:29,475
Please fill it out.

11
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:30,620
What is this?

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,115
(He is on his guard.)

13
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,590
Kwang Soo, here you go.

14
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:36,720
(All the members receive the same questionnaire as well.)

15
00:00:36,726 --> 00:00:38,260
"The Secret That Can't Be Told"?

16
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:40,285
(What is this?)

17
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,425
- "The Secret that Can't Be Told". - "The Secret that Can't Be Told".

18
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:45,400
"Write down the secrets you know about the members."

19
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:49,925
(You are prohibited from telling the others.)

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,170
- The members' secrets? - Yes.

21
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:55,070
(Thinking)

22
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:57,635
They are secrets for a reason.

23
00:00:57,681 --> 00:00:59,810
Why would I reveal them?

24
00:00:59,816 --> 00:01:01,980
You want me to tell the secrets that are true, right?

25
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:04,050
They have to be true.

26
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:06,150
If I do that, a few of them will have to retire.

27
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:08,720
What should I do? Those who will have to retire are...

28
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:11,820
Seok Jin, Kwang Soo,

29
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:15,790
So Min, and Se Chan. I can end their careers.

30
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,800
I won't reveal Jong Kook's secrets because he is my business partner.

31
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:20,070
(His business partner's secrets are safe.)

32
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,470
It's for my sake.

33
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:24,870
Gosh, how much should I reveal about Kwang Soo?

34
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,540
Kwang Soo.

35
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,540
(Meanwhile, Kwang Soo...)

36
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:31,675
About three days ago,

37
00:01:32,682 --> 00:01:34,345
So Min...

38
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,845
I don't know if I should reveal it since it really happened.

39
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:41,250
(He reveals So Min's secret he witnessed 3 days ago.)

40
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:43,285
What did you write about me?

41
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,290
- I couldn't write anything. - What did you write about me?

42
00:01:45,295 --> 00:01:46,730
- I couldn't write anything. - I protected you.

43
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,690
I protected you.

44
00:01:48,698 --> 00:01:50,300
- Seriously, - Did you write anything down?

45
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
I wrote down a secret that can be told.

46
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,100
Although the questionnaire was named The Secret that Can't Be Told,

47
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:56,995
I didn't want to force you to retire.

48
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,640
I will make this episode...

49
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,070
your last episode.

50
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:05,275
Thank you for your hard work, So Min.

51
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:08,005
The female celebrity's name was...

52
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,180
(He reveals other members' secrets without taking a breather.)

53
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:12,680
I can write down another one, right?

54
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,090
Let's go down together.

55
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,290
(They even report real secrets that exceed expectations.)

56
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:19,585
(What is the purpose of writing down these secrets?)

57
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:23,430
- Hello. - Hello.

58
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:28,025
Please take a shot of So Min's new hairstyle.

59
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:30,465
- She got a bob cut. - A bob cut.

60
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,600
It's unstylish.

61
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:36,780
Seok Jin kept asking me if I couldn't wear a wig.

62
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,180
- I had no choice. - It suits you.

63
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,980
She got a haircut to play the role of an unstylish woman.

64
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:44,675
I don't see why it was necessary since she was already unstylish.

65
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:46,450
She reminds me of the countryside.

66
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:48,650
Doesn't she have many lookalikes with that new haircut?

67
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:50,160
- Who? - You know,

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,060
Kim Byung Ok in "Lady Vengeance".

69
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:56,730
- She resembles him a bit. - She does.

70
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,700
- She resembles Byung Ok. - She resembles him a bit.

71
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,800
- She does. - She does, right?

72
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,930
- I am so scared. - Right?

73
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,400
(I can contain my anger.)

74
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,700
- She does. - Isn't that Choi Yang Rak's hair?

75
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:06,770
(It looks familiar.)

76
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,410
- You are right. - "Alkkagi".

77
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:09,910
He had that hair in "Alkkagi".

78
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,980
- It's Yang Rak's hairstyle. - By the way...

79
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,240
It's Yang Rak's hairstyle.

80
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:16,180
Seok Jin leads fashion.

81
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,880
He is wearing Heung Bu's pants today.

82
00:03:17,887 --> 00:03:19,080
(Heung Bu's pants)

83
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:20,790
He is wearing Heung Bu's pants today.

84
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,920
(He leads fashion with Heung Bu's pants.)

85
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,660
- Heung Bu's pants. - That's hilarious.

86
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,790
I can't believe Jae Seok noticed them.

87
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:29,290
Seok Jin, show them the back of your pants as well.

88
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,300
(The back is worse.)

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,800
There is a patch on the back of the knee.

90
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:34,930
Seriously.

91
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,870
A swallow might show up today like it did in the fairy tale.

92
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:39,595
- A swallow. - A swallow might show up.

93
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:43,270
A swallow will be able to break your legs.

94
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,140
(Heung Bu's pants make his legs look skinnier.)

95
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:47,350
Stop it already.

96
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,105
This is the hobo look.

97
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:52,645
I will forgive you since it was funny.

98
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:55,350
What are we doing today?

99
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,890
- What are we doing today? - Yes.

100
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:00,360
You know.

101
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,190
- What? - You know.

102
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:04,300
(Does Jae Seok know about the race of the day?)

103
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,055
Is it a secret mission?

104
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:07,570
Does Jae Seok know?

105
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,200
Today, we will have a race Jae Seok prepared.

106
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,035
Did Jae Seok prepare the race?

107
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:13,910
Did you prepare the race?

108
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,980
Jae Seok is so mean. How could he feign ignorance...

109
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,410
and ask what we are doing today?

110
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:20,780
He feigned ignorance and asked, "What are we doing today?"

111
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,720
Hold on. The race I prepared today is...

112
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,080
- Tell us. - You know,

113
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:27,650
I got the idea...

114
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:30,190
from watching a movie.

115
00:04:30,193 --> 00:04:32,090
"Truth or Dare".

116
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:34,460
("Truth or Dare")

117
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,360
- What does mean? - Don't roll your tongue.

118
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:38,000
- Isn't it a scary movie? - Yes, it is.

119
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,930
- I watched "Truth or Dare". - You did, right?

120
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,300
- It shows a strange-looking face. - You either tell the truth...

121
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:43,570
- or perform a dare. - That's right.

122
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,240
(You either tell the truth or perform a dare.)

123
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,500
That's right.

124
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,540
(You either tell the truth or perform a dare.)

125
00:04:47,544 --> 00:04:48,640
Truth or Dare.

126
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:51,340
You either tell the truth or perform a dare.

127
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:54,710
If you don't want to tell the truth, you simply have to perform a dare.

128
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:57,050
- Telling the truth will be easier. - That's right. Everyone,

129
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:00,050
do you agree to participate in this game?

130
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:01,990
(Do you agree to participate in this game?)

131
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:04,290
- Yes. - Of course. This is a shoot.

132
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:06,890
Everyone,

133
00:05:06,896 --> 00:05:10,360
do you agree to participate in Truth or Dare?

134
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:11,600
1, 2, 3.

135
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:12,660
- Yes. - Yes.

136
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:14,270
- 1, 2, 3. - Yes.

137
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,970
(All the members agree to participate in Truth or Dare.)

138
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,270
That's good. Everyone agreed to participate in the game.

139
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:21,770
Why are you trying to look so cool? What are you doing?

140
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:23,440
(What are you doing?)

141
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,610
- Are you launching a new program? - It'll start now.

142
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:27,010
What happens if I don't agree?

143
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:28,110
- What? - What happens if I don't agree?

144
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:29,880
Then you can go home.

145
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,450
- Go home. - I agree to participate.

146
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,875
- You can go home. - No, I agree to participate.

147
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,590
Okay.

148
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:38,185
Truth or Dare.

149
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:39,720
Where are we going?

150
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,655
A moment ago,

151
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,660
all of you agreed to participate in Truth or Dare.

152
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:48,300
We had no choice if we didn't want to go home.

153
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,270
We will now begin the first game.

154
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:53,670
- Are we starting right away? - We are in a bus.

155
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,640
(Are we starting right away in this bus?)

156
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:57,780
- Right now? It's so soon. - In a bus?

157
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,880
Yes.

158
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,180
The first question goes to Seok Jin.

159
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,180
(Seok Jin's decision)

160
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,980
Okay.

161
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,620
Truth or Dare?

162
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:09,550
(Truth or Dare?)

163
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:11,815
Go for dare.

164
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:14,630
- Dare. - Then he has to perform a dare.

165
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:15,790
I choose dare.

166
00:06:15,798 --> 00:06:18,795
(The first player, Seok Jin, chooses dare.)

167
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,200
(A dare envelope is handed to him.)

168
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:22,730
What does it say? Can you tell us?

169
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,540
- Can we take a look together? - "Is Your Nose Big?"

170
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,300
(The name of the dare is "Is Your Nose Big?")

171
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:28,810
"Put a 10-cent coin in your nose for 3 seconds to succeed."

172
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:30,170
- You can easily do that. - A 10-cent coin?

173
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,710
- It's easy. - It's easy.

174
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:33,340
- It's not too bad. - It's easy.

175
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:35,880
- It's easy. - It's a reasonable dare.

176
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,250
While Seok Jin has a big nose,

177
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:39,820
his has small nostrils.

178
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:42,290
How does the size differ?

179
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,060
(He practices before he begins.)

180
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,360
What? I don't think it's going in.

181
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:51,530
- Put it sideways. - He got a nose surgery.

182
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:52,630
It's not going in.

183
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:55,030
(He faces an unexpected challenge.)

184
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:57,270
Gosh, it's not going in.

185
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,370
- Hold on. - I told you. His nose is big,

186
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,170
but his nostrils are small.

187
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:03,470
- This is a disaster. - Get ready.

188
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,005
Go.

189
00:07:05,048 --> 00:07:07,380
- It will be hard. - My goodness.

190
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,910
- It hurts. - Is it not going in?

191
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:11,250
- Is it not going in? - It's not going in.

192
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:14,115
- Seok Jin doesn't have a big nose. - Five,

193
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,090
- 4, 3, - For goodness' sake.

194
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:19,060
- 2, 1. - He is trying so hard.

195
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:21,525
- One. - Time's up.

196
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:23,700
It's not going in. Do you want to try it?

197
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,900
- Time's up. - Are you serious?

198
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,700
Seok Jin is out.

199
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:30,330
(Time's over.)

200
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:31,640
- What? - Out?

201
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,835
- Out? - Out?

202
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:35,970
(A failure to put a coin in his nostril...)

203
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:39,040
(gets him eliminated.)

204
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:40,080
(They are only 15 minutes into the shoot.)

205
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:42,610
- He said Seok Jin is out. - What?

206
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:44,420
- Already? - What is going on?

207
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,880
- Out? - Please pull over.

208
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:47,550
(Please pull over, Mr. Driver.)

209
00:07:47,557 --> 00:07:49,990
- He asked the driver to pull over. - Are you serious?

210
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,920
- What? - What are you doing?

211
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:55,090
- Are you sending him home? - We just began.

212
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:57,200
(Seok Jin breaks the record of going home the earliest.)

213
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,700
- We just began. - Gosh, that startled me.

214
00:08:00,703 --> 00:08:03,070
(They see something.)

215
00:08:03,072 --> 00:08:05,440
(After the sudden announcement of Seok Jin's elimination,)

216
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,870
(masked strangers enter the bus.)

217
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:09,705
Gosh, that startled me.

218
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:11,810
- Is this the end for him? - Is he going home early?

219
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:14,050
- Is he leaving? - Heung Bu!

220
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,880
Heung Bu! Come back!

221
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,875
Like the song title goes, "Heung Bu Is Shocked".

222
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:20,690
"Heung Bu Is Shocked".

223
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,550
Seok Jin is shocked

224
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,090
- He really left. - Really?

225
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,060
- Is he out? - Hold on.

226
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,360
We are leaving.

227
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:32,630
You received an invitation.

228
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,100
What is this?

229
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,600
(What is this invitation?)

230
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,400
What is this?

231
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,700
- What is this? - It's an invitation.

232
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,910
"Dangerous Choice, Truth or Dare."

233
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:45,080
"You have been invited to the Truth or Dare Game."

234
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,250
"You are out if you tell a lie or fail to perform a dare."

235
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:51,080
"When three members are out, the timer starts."

236
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,880
"If you don't figure out a way..."

237
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,990
"to end the game until the time is up,"

238
00:08:54,991 --> 00:08:56,650
- "everyone is out." - It looks like...

239
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,790
we need to figure out a way to end the game.

240
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:02,290
Whether we choose Truth or Dare,

241
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:05,100
we must succeed in receiving a hint to end the game.

242
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,000
It's the same in the movie.

243
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,800
- Really? - Yes.

244
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,870
- Then we can escape. - That's right.

245
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:14,040
The person who asked the first question was...

246
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,435
- Jae Seok. - What?

247
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:19,010
The person who asked the first question was...

248
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,410
- Jae Seok. - What?

249
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,580
- What is happening? - Is this an individual race?

250
00:09:21,584 --> 00:09:23,050
Are we on our own?

251
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:26,215
(This morning, two hours before the shoot,)

252
00:09:26,689 --> 00:09:31,285
(the mysterious man visited Jae Seok who came before the other members.)

253
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:35,930
(You startled me. Who are you?)

254
00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:37,330
What is this all of a sudden?

255
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,700
Truth or Dare.

256
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:41,000
Choose one, please.

257
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,770
(I did suggest this idea, but this is so sudden.)

258
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,270
Unbelievable.

259
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:47,640
(This is his catch-22. Will he choose Truth or Dare?)

260
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,770
I choose dare.

261
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,310
- You chose dare. - Okay.

262
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:51,340
(The first challenger is Jae Seok.)

263
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,935
What is this?

264
00:09:53,749 --> 00:09:55,310
"Truth or Dare".

265
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,780
"You chose dare."

266
00:09:56,786 --> 00:09:59,050
"Make all of the members participate in this game."

267
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,320
"If they don't, you will be eliminated."

268
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:01,915
(He will be eliminated if they don't participate in it.)

269
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,090
I'll be eliminated if I fail?

270
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:05,590
(He must get everyone to play the game.)

271
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:09,690
(That's why Jae Seok pretended to be a cool host.)

272
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,000
(He tried multiple times. He screamed at the members...)

273
00:10:13,002 --> 00:10:15,530
(and pretended to be serious.)

274
00:10:15,538 --> 00:10:16,770
1, 2, 3.

275
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,300
(Before they realized it, everyone agreed to play.)

276
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,710
(You heard them, right? Everyone said they'd play.)

277
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,270
(Jae Seok's one-sided hosting led him to the first success.)

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,440
- That's why he asked us... - I see.

279
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,010
- My goodness. - all those questions.

280
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,580
I'm in the same boat with you all.

281
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:30,150
I have to choose between Truth and Dare.

282
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,520
The man came to my car and asked me that.

283
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,285
Since Jae Seok succeeded his first dare,

284
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,590
- we will give him a hint. - My gosh.

285
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,120
(Jae Seok gets the first hint since he successfully did his dare.)

286
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:41,185
- You should give me the hint. - Will he read it by himself?

287
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,930
We all have to work together.

288
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,730
- We need hints to figure this out. - Exactly.

289
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,960
- How does this qualify as a hint? - This is a team mission.

290
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,465
"Only Jae Seok takes care of Seok Jin."

291
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:52,840
(First hint: Only Jae Seok takes care of Seok Jin.)

292
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:55,170
- That's the hint? - How is this a hint?

293
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:56,710
- This can't be a hint. - Something is going on here.

294
00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:59,740
Think about it. Seok Jin was eliminated right away.

295
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:01,080
My guess is that it has to do with this.

296
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,080
We have to figure out how we can end this game...

297
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,580
- by gathering hints like this one. - That's our first step.

298
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:08,590
- Remember the forms you filled out? - Yes.

299
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:12,090
We will use the true stories from the forms.

300
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:15,060
You will select the ones we wrote down?

301
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:18,000
We're all on the same team. You didn't take it too far, right?

302
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
- Of course not. - No, I didn't.

303
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:22,070
(The bigger the secrets are, the more unfavorable it gets.)

304
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,130
Kwang Soo.

305
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,740
You didn't see this coming when you filled it out, right?

306
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,070
I had no idea.

307
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,470
(I'm doomed.)

308
00:11:27,476 --> 00:11:29,870
- Hey. - I had no idea we'd be a team.

309
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,980
- What is it? What? - I thought the harsher,

310
00:11:31,981 --> 00:11:33,310
- the better. - Gosh, you're unbelievable.

311
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,680
- What are you saying now? - Listen.

312
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:37,950
But I... I only wrote down the facts.

313
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,875
- Hey. - What's worse is that Haha...

314
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,420
- Never mind. - I didn't...

315
00:11:41,424 --> 00:11:42,750
I didn't write one for Haha...

316
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:45,085
because I thought he'd end up in big trouble.

317
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,290
- I'm serious. - Let's go all the way.

318
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,430
Where are we going by the way?

319
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:50,130
I wonder what Seok Jin is doing now.

320
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:51,630
(The bus with dangerous secrets travels deep into some place.)

321
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,500
(In no time, they arrive at their destination.)

322
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:55,865
- Let's go. Let's get it! - What is this place?

323
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:58,100
(They get off the bus since they have arrived.)

324
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,035
- Hey. - Where are we?

325
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:01,910
Where are we?

326
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:03,410
(The gate gives off an eerie vibe.)

327
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,340
Isn't that... Isn't that a real warehouse?

328
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,750
We'll go in there? What's that place?

329
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,680
(What is the secret hidden in this place?)

330
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:12,215
What's going on?

331
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:17,385
(7 members except Seok Jin enter the mysterious warehouse.)

332
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:22,755
(This place is spacious. What is this place?)

333
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:24,600
What's that?

334
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,125
- Cell 1, Cell 2... - Hey, guys!

335
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,900
- Hey, guys! - Seok Jin!

336
00:12:28,904 --> 00:12:30,770
- Seok Jin is locked up. - What's happening here?

337
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:32,470
(Wait, but he's surrounded by massage boards.)

338
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:33,670
Don't you think this is too harsh?

339
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:34,770
- These are massage boards. - Hey.

340
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:36,110
- Help me. - What's happening?

341
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,480
- There's a lock here. - What is this?

342
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,075
(Where is Seok Jin locked up at?)

343
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:42,150
(Welcome to Truth or Dare House.)

344
00:12:42,151 --> 00:12:43,905
I see a bucket of water in this one.

345
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,550
If we don't do chin-ups, we'll fall into the water?

346
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,250
- One cell has a treadmill. - I guess we have to keep running.

347
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:50,350
We can neither sit nor stand in that cell.

348
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,460
(And Seok Jin is locked up inside.)

349
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,390
- That must be really hard. - I think it gets worse.

350
00:12:53,396 --> 00:12:54,760
- You're right. - Hey.

351
00:12:54,764 --> 00:12:57,655
- Gosh, I hate this. - Darn it!

352
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,930
Gosh, this hurts!

353
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,030
(But at that time...)

354
00:13:00,036 --> 00:13:01,430
(Clinking)

355
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,000
- No, someone is locking the doors. - What's going on?

356
00:13:03,005 --> 00:13:04,740
- Open up! - No, no!

357
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,670
(It gets worse. Someone is locking the doors.)

358
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:09,770
(They hurriedly run to the door but to no avail.)

359
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:11,180
- What just happened? - Oh, no!

360
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,510
- They locked us in here. - They really locked us in.

361
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:13,580
They even used a lock.

362
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:15,280
(Without the faintest idea of what's happening to them...)

363
00:13:15,284 --> 00:13:17,310
- We can't go out. - They locked the doors.

364
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,045
(They locked up their only exit.)

365
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:22,350
- Hold on. Is this really happening? - Wait.

366
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,445
- Is there a restroom here? - They really locked it.

367
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,020
Hey, they locked the doors from outside.

368
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:27,190
- Hey. - They locked the doors.

369
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,525
What is this place now?

370
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,900
- What's going on here? - This is getting crazy.

371
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,670
(Truth or Dare, which only ends with the hidden secret, begins.)

372
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,500
The member who will receive the question is...

373
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:37,800
(The third member after Jae Seok and Seok Jin is...)

374
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,340
- Lee Kwang Soo. - My gosh.

375
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,610
(Kwang Soo is the third member who will get the question.)

376
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,710
(It's Kwang Soo, the weakest member's turn.)

377
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:43,810
Kwang Soo, choose truth.

378
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,540
- You just need to tell the truth. - Go with truth.

379
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,650
Remember that Cell Two has a treadmill.

380
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,080
Kwang Soo, you'll sweat buckets in there.

381
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:51,220
- Why is it my turn? - Just go with truth.

382
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,875
Truth or Dare.

383
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:56,590
- Kwang Soo, don't go with dare. - Kwang Soo, go with truth.

384
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,620
- He should choose truth. - Of course.

385
00:13:58,627 --> 00:13:59,990
Truth... All I have to do is tell the truth.

386
00:13:59,995 --> 00:14:01,660
- I might fail to do my dare. - That's right.

387
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,490
- But I can just tell the truth. - You can do that.

388
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,130
- Right. I can't fail with truth. - Hey.

389
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:07,200
- You should tell that. - Tell what?

390
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,470
The truth. Tell the truth.

391
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:10,630
(He pretends as if it's not a big deal.)

392
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,940
What are you saying?

393
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,600
- What was that? - Tell that.

394
00:14:13,609 --> 00:14:15,070
- Sorry? - You can just tell the truth.

395
00:14:15,077 --> 00:14:16,310
- What is he saying? - That'll be better.

396
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:17,910
- You just need to tell the truth. - Okay.

397
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,140
Just tell the truth.

398
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:22,250
It's scary that he can't know the question before choosing.

399
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:23,510
That's a true dare.

400
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,220
(Will he choose Truth or Dare which his career is at stake?)

401
00:14:26,222 --> 00:14:27,320
- Truth. - Okay!

402
00:14:27,323 --> 00:14:29,050
(I have nothing to be scared of!)

403
00:14:29,058 --> 00:14:30,420
I can just answer truthfully.

404
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:33,120
- What is it? What's the question? - What is it?

405
00:14:33,129 --> 00:14:35,125
I can answer every question.

406
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,090
They're my family.

407
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:38,660
- Viewers... - What is it?

408
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,495
Read it. Kwang Soo, read it for us.

409
00:14:40,936 --> 00:14:42,000
Let me see. What is it?

410
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:43,030
(He freezes as soon as he reads.)

411
00:14:43,038 --> 00:14:44,100
He froze.

412
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:45,840
(What is the question?)

413
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,040
"Tell Kwang Soo's embarrassing..."

414
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:49,340
"Tell your embarrassing stories that Jae Seok knows about."

415
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:51,205
(Kwang Soo's embarrassing stories with women)

416
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,280
Poor him. This is bad.

417
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,380
Kwang Soo.

418
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:57,575
(Kwang Soo, just tell them.)

419
00:14:57,786 --> 00:14:59,120
Come on, tell them.

420
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:01,250
- What's wrong with that? - Just tell them.

421
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:03,790
You must tell the truth for us to get the hints.

422
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,160
- Kwang Soo, just don't lie. - That's right.

423
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,855
Just be honest.

424
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:09,430
You guys are so annoying right now.

425
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,600
- "Just don't lie"? - This is...

426
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,530
(This game is fun as long as it's not about me.)

427
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,930
But Jae Seok knows a lot of my stories.

428
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:19,570
Tell embarrassing stories with women that Jae Seok knows about.

429
00:15:19,575 --> 00:15:20,970
- I bet this one is funny. - It's probably this one.

430
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:23,310
Probably? Okay. Go ahead.

431
00:15:23,312 --> 00:15:25,175
I asked Jae Seok...

432
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,240
for advice about the troubles I had.

433
00:15:27,249 --> 00:15:28,510
(He asked Jae Seok for advice regarding women.)

434
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:29,510
It was at night.

435
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:30,710
- It was about your dating life? - Right.

436
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,180
- Yes. - Don't leave out details.

437
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:34,475
I had a feeling...

438
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:36,220
that she was interested in me.

439
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:38,290
- And I was interested in her too. - There was a fling.

440
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:40,460
Yes. I went to Jae Seok's house.

441
00:15:40,462 --> 00:15:42,030
The two of us talked in the car.

442
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:44,060
- It was the two of you in the car. - You went to Apgujeong?

443
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,895
Jae Seok said,

444
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,695
"Kwang Soo."

445
00:15:48,037 --> 00:15:49,665
"If you don't tell her..."

446
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:52,740
- Was it a green light? - "about your feelings now,"

447
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,435
"you might lose her for good."

448
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:59,535
(This dating coach gave Kwang Soo a sharp advice.)

449
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:01,250
(Everyone sighs.)

450
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,480
- Right now. - "This is the time."

451
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:04,075
Okay.

452
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:06,980
- That's right. - The story is embarrassing me.

453
00:16:06,989 --> 00:16:08,790
The next day...

454
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,190
(He followed Jae Seok's advice and texted her the next day.)

455
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:12,155
- You did it right away. - "I think..."

456
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:13,320
"I like you."

457
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:14,860
- You texted her? - Yes.

458
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:16,590
- Great. That was great. - I did.

459
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:17,660
Can I tell the whole story?

460
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,455
- You did well. - Okay.

461
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:21,695
I said,

462
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:23,700
"Do you want to date me?"

463
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:26,140
(Do you want to date me?)

464
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,240
- Kwang Soo. - Well done.

465
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:28,740
- This... - No.

466
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:29,940
- Seriously. - Okay.

467
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,540
- I'm getting hot. - This is more...

468
00:16:31,547 --> 00:16:33,410
- romantic than a romance movie. - Right?

469
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:34,550
So what happened?

470
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,210
- She answered... - My heart is fluttering.

471
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:37,845
my text message.

472
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:38,980
"Kwang Soo."

473
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:42,890
(Was the dating coach's advice spot on?)

474
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:43,890
("Kwang Soo...")

475
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,190
"You might've gotten the wrong idea."

476
00:16:45,194 --> 00:16:48,325
("You might've gotten the wrong idea.")

477
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,060
(He's known for his misunderstandings.)

478
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:51,925
How humiliating.

479
00:16:52,368 --> 00:16:54,800
(This happens all the time to guys with little experience.)

480
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,170
"I don't see you like that."

481
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,200
I...

482
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,600
- "We're just colleagues." - You'd have my vote.

483
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,600
That guy...

484
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:01,640
(Enraged)

485
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,335
destroyed...

486
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,740
my precious tie with her.

487
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,875
This is so humiliating.

488
00:17:06,982 --> 00:17:08,650
Whenever I think about her...

489
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:11,380
She wouldn't have known this if you didn't confess.

490
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:12,620
You...

491
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:15,020
- "We're colleagues." - You have my vote.

492
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:17,815
Kwang Soo, did this happen only once?

493
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:19,760
- You know the number of times? - Pardon?

494
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:21,060
- Did that happen only once? - What do you mean?

495
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,060
I guess there's another one.

496
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:25,095
- What? - Did you get dumped only once?

497
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,900
(This dating coach has an urgent sense to make reports.)

498
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,730
Is that the only celebrity?

499
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:30,900
How much did you tell them?

500
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:33,070
- You should've told only one story. - Kwang Soo, tell the truth.

501
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:35,340
- Just tell the truth. - You should've written down one.

502
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,070
If we can help it, we shouldn't choose truth.

503
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,480
There are so many.

504
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,305
Is this what he said? The lady...

505
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,080
who was having a fling with me.

506
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:44,320
This is another lady now.

507
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,420
She had a love scandal with someone else.

508
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:46,680
Is that what you told him?

509
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,345
(She had a love scandal with someone else. Is this it?)

510
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:51,690
- That's not it. - What is it then?

511
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,190
Tell me what you told him so I can talk about that!

512
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,460
- I didn't tell him that. - I mean...

513
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:57,860
- I told him no such stories. - Tell me what you told him...

514
00:17:57,866 --> 00:17:59,030
- so I can tell that story. - I didn't say that.

515
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:00,930
- Why would you bring that up now? - Listen to me.

516
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,095
I told him no such stories.

517
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:05,400
If you tell me about how many times you confessed your feelings,

518
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:06,740
- How many times? - we'll accept your answer.

519
00:18:06,742 --> 00:18:07,740
It's about your confessions.

520
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,865
The criteria for confessions might be a bit tricky.

521
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:12,905
I'll count similar experiences.

522
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,045
- I did that about 4 times. - 4 times?

523
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:18,220
(If Jae Seok wrote down a higher number than 4,)

524
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,245
(Kwang Soo will go to the cell with the treadmill since he lied.)

525
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:23,820
You really got dumped four times?

526
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:24,990
His number is lower than mine.

527
00:18:24,993 --> 00:18:26,020
(He got dumped about 3 times.)

528
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,890
I wrote you got dumped 3 times, but you said 4 times.

529
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:29,385
Who is the last one?

530
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,690
Gosh, that's right.

531
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,730
But you told the truth.

532
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:34,060
That's true.

533
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,470
- He asked me for advice thrice. - Look at his face.

534
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,300
- Thank you for your sacrifice. - Seriously.

535
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:39,895
You did that for our team.

536
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,310
He did that for our team.

537
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,570
Anyway, they weren't meant to be.

538
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,580
- That's why it didn't happen. - That's right.

539
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:47,240
- Right. - But at that time...

540
00:18:47,249 --> 00:18:48,750
I called Jae Seok.

541
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:51,050
I said, "Jae Seok, she texted me back."

542
00:18:51,053 --> 00:18:52,720
I told him what she wrote.

543
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,990
- As soon as I told him that... - What did he say?

544
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,485
(Laughing)

545
00:18:59,795 --> 00:19:01,190
- He's such a rascal. - Hey.

546
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:02,590
Jae Seok, you're such a rascal.

547
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,500
- Listen. - Did you do that on purpose?

548
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,000
He wanted you to get popular.

549
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,360
- Hey. - That's right.

550
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:08,900
He was bored at home. This was a nice distraction.

551
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:09,930
You fell for it.

552
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:11,340
- He wanted to make funny stories. - No.

553
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,840
- To make funny stories? - I...

554
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,240
- I... - He wanted to make it funny.

555
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:16,440
It's great if things work out after he confesses his feelings.

556
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:18,440
- What if he gets dumped? - Even if it doesn't work out,

557
00:19:18,447 --> 00:19:21,880
as you just said, I was a bit bored that day.

558
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:23,250
- It made you laugh. - It...

559
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:24,250
(It made Jae Seok's boring day more interesting.)

560
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,420
It made you laugh.

561
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:26,450
It was like a welcoming rain.

562
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:30,385
(Kwang Soo wins a hint by sacrificing himself. What is it?)

563
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,530
(The second hint: 100 versus 100)

564
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,560
Hold on.

565
00:19:35,564 --> 00:19:36,590
(100 versus 100?)

566
00:19:36,598 --> 00:19:37,860
I think I know.

567
00:19:37,866 --> 00:19:39,900
We once filmed an episode called "100 versus 100".

568
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,330
That's right.

569
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:43,670
- Some judo players came and... - That's right.

570
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,640
Could it be about people we know? Our acquaintances?

571
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:49,210
I think we need 2 or 3 more hints.

572
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:50,870
I think so too. It's still unclear.

573
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,880
(What could be the solution?)

574
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:55,510
Now I'll ask all of you a question.

575
00:19:55,517 --> 00:19:57,250
Truth or Dare?

576
00:19:57,252 --> 00:19:58,420
Let's choose dare.

577
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,950
- Let's choose dare. - I can't do this.

578
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:01,590
- Let's choose dare. - Let's choose dare.

579
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,950
We should choose dare.

580
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:03,950
Let's choose dare.

581
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:05,090
- Hold on. - I can't do this.

582
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:08,260
You said we should choose truth.

583
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:09,360
- Let's choose dare. - Let's choose dare.

584
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:10,630
- You said we should choose truth. - Let's choose dare.

585
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:11,700
It's for everyone.

586
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
We're good at group games.

587
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:15,330
1, 2, 3.

588
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:17,195
- Dare! - Dare!

589
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:19,470
(Kwang Soo is forced to choose dare.)

590
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,000
- We all chose dare. - Truth.

591
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,640
(Why are you doing this to me?)

592
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:24,205
Dare. You're too late.

593
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:26,880
- What does it say? - A Sweet Life?

594
00:20:26,882 --> 00:20:30,505
(Their group mission is called A Sweet Life.)

595
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,580
Each of us will get a bag of 10 candies.

596
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:36,390
Each round, we have to submit...

597
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,190
some of our candies.

598
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,390
After three rounds, if we have submitted...

599
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:43,530
more than 30 candies, we succeed.

600
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:46,530
It means we all need to submit a certain number of candies.

601
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:47,700
- But... - At the end...

602
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's say after three rounds,

603
00:20:49,004 --> 00:20:50,530
we have submitted more than 30 candies.

604
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,470
The one who has the least candies left...

605
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,040
- will be out. - So...

606
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,710
(The one who has the least candies left will be out.)

607
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,535
It's a mind game.

608
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,710
Let's not think too much.

609
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:00,840
(Loyalty is their weakest point.)

610
00:21:00,849 --> 00:21:03,410
- Let's all submit at least five. - Should we?

611
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:04,680
- Then it's 35 in total. - If anyone submits less...

612
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:06,150
Hold on.

613
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:07,620
Let me...

614
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,690
announce the blacklist.

615
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:10,690
- You're on the list. - You.

616
00:21:10,692 --> 00:21:12,160
Why would you announce that?

617
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,520
Who gives you the right?

618
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:14,530
- Seriously. - Okay.

619
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,890
- Five candies, okay? - Okay.

620
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:16,960
Promise?

621
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:18,860
- Trust me. - You better submit five.

622
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,030
- You. - I'll submit five.

623
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,670
- Submit 5. - I took out 5.

624
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,030
You better submit five.

625
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,940
(So Min is ready to submit five.)

626
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:28,470
I hate it when she does this.

627
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:29,540
It's too obvious.

628
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:30,710
She already took out five.

629
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:32,210
- I took out five. - She's suspicious.

630
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:34,110
Seriously. There's no reason to lie.

631
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:36,945
These two are the same.

632
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,350
(Kwang Soo takes out 5 too.)

633
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:39,720
- What? - Stop it.

634
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,220
I shouldn't do this?

635
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:42,290
Just trust him.

636
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:44,150
Otherwise, he'll get mean.

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,420
(Will they be all right?)

638
00:21:45,427 --> 00:21:47,120
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide the order.

639
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,830
Let's just play Race of Wits.

640
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,330
- Okay. - Again?

641
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:53,630
(It might become their official game.)

642
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:55,170
Ready.

643
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,500
- Start. - One.

644
00:21:56,505 --> 00:21:57,500
- 2. - 3.

645
00:21:57,506 --> 00:21:58,600
- 4. - 5.

646
00:21:58,607 --> 00:21:59,600
Six.

647
00:21:59,608 --> 00:22:00,900
(Haha loses.)

648
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,405
Seven.

649
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:04,840
- Gosh. - You go first.

650
00:22:04,846 --> 00:22:06,080
(Haha will submit his candies first.)

651
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,510
Haha goes first.

652
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:08,550
Close your eyes.

653
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,610
Please turn around.

654
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,010
- Okay. - Trust me.

655
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:12,620
My image...

656
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:16,190
(Should I keep my promise?)

657
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:23,290
(They all promised to submit at least 5 candies.)

658
00:22:23,298 --> 00:22:25,255
It's simple. I don't even have to think.

659
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:30,700
(Haha submits 5 candies as promised.)

660
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:33,440
(I kept my promise.)

661
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:34,840
- I'm done. - I...

662
00:22:34,843 --> 00:22:36,810
I always keep my promise.

663
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,110
You can submit more than five if you want.

664
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,340
- I'll submit just five. - That'd be simple.

665
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,580
Okay.

666
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:43,410
I really submitted five.

667
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,510
(Jong Kook submits 5 candies.)

668
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,720
- I'll submit my candies. - Go ahead.

669
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,320
I trust you.

670
00:22:48,323 --> 00:22:49,490
Think after you submit your candies.

671
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,020
I can't wait to find out...

672
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:52,685
how many he submitted.

673
00:22:52,694 --> 00:22:54,290
(Let me see.)

674
00:22:54,296 --> 00:22:55,790
Haha.

675
00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:57,130
- Haha. - Yes?

676
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:58,130
You shouldn't look.

677
00:22:58,133 --> 00:23:00,330
(This 40-year-old guy is very curious.)

678
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,125
What's taking you so long?

679
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,530
There's no reason to take so long.

680
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:05,395
(How many candies did Jae Seok submit?)

681
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:06,700
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

682
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:08,195
Really?

683
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,510
(Will she submit 5 candies as she normally would?)

684
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:11,875
I'm sure she'll be reasonable.

685
00:23:13,015 --> 00:23:15,605
(Okay. I've made up my mind.)

686
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:20,050
(What? Just 1?)

687
00:23:20,055 --> 00:23:24,120
(She breaks her promise and submits just 1 candy.)

688
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:25,615
But...

689
00:23:26,695 --> 00:23:28,460
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

690
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:30,490
I don't hear any rustle.

691
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:32,500
(Is he not submitting any?)

692
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:34,200
(Se Chan deliberately makes a rustling sound.)

693
00:23:34,202 --> 00:23:35,870
Don't think too much.

694
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:38,170
Let's just trust each other.

695
00:23:38,173 --> 00:23:39,770
Let's at least win a hint...

696
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,100
- if we're doing this anyway. - Submit five first,

697
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:42,370
and think later.

698
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,540
We shouldn't...

699
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:45,580
I'm done.

700
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,840
(In the end, Se Chan submits only 2.)

701
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:49,850
Let me announce the result of Round One.

702
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,650
- It's supposed to be over 30. - Yes.

703
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,120
- It's supposed to be 35. - I submitted a lot.

704
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:54,220
We're supposed to be finished now.

705
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,320
It has to be 35.

706
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:56,490
The number of the candies you submitted is...

707
00:23:56,491 --> 00:23:58,990
(After Round 1)

708
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:00,390
17.

709
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,155
(It's less than half of their goal.)

710
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:04,460
- You jerks... - You guys...

711
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:05,800
- Also, - I...

712
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:08,070
what we have here is 17 candies...

713
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,000
and one microphone cover.

714
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:11,770
(17 candies and 1 microphone cover)

715
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:13,470
A microphone cover? Kwang Soo, do you have yours?

716
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,110
(It must be Kwang Soo.)

717
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,540
Haha, where is yours?

718
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:18,010
- What happened? - It's not me!

719
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:19,110
Gosh!

720
00:24:19,114 --> 00:24:20,610
- It's really not me. - What did you do?

721
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:22,250
- Where's your microphone cover? - It's not me, I swear.

722
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,880
- Hey! - When did this happen?

723
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:25,480
Are you serious?

724
00:24:25,487 --> 00:24:27,375
(It's fun to watch them fight.)

725
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,690
Stop doing this.

726
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,890
(Haha looks frustrated. What really happened?)

727
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:35,325
(A few minutes ago, Jae Seok was submitting candies.)

728
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:39,125
(Haha dropped his microphone cover while trying to peek.)

729
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:43,130
(Haha himself wasn't aware of it.)

730
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:45,840
(Kwang Soo approaches.)

731
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:51,840
(Kwang Soo picks up Haha's microphone cover.)

732
00:24:51,847 --> 00:24:53,980
(Is mine still here?)

733
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,350
We just need to submit 30.

734
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,910
(He submits only Haha's microphone cover.)

735
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,880
I submitted some, I swear.

736
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:01,550
Your bag is still full.

737
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:02,720
I submitted some.

738
00:25:02,724 --> 00:25:04,415
Did he take others' candies too?

739
00:25:05,026 --> 00:25:07,090
He probably didn't know the director would mention it.

740
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,190
(Why did you mention it?)

741
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:09,260
Gosh.

742
00:25:09,264 --> 00:25:10,760
- You took off the cover? - You're not telling us the numbers?

743
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:12,030
You're unbelievable.

744
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,330
You'll find out how many I submitted.

745
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:16,270
You took the cover off and submitted it?

746
00:25:16,271 --> 00:25:17,330
(It's funny, right?)

747
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,640
It is funny though.

748
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
So we've submitted 17 so far.

749
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:21,440
Let's think about it.

750
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,835
- Who grabbed my neck? - We need to submit 13 more.

751
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:25,410
- Submit some. - Okay.

752
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,175
Hold on.

753
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:28,610
(Jong Kook makes you answer automatically.)

754
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:30,280
Hold on. Jae Seok.

755
00:25:30,285 --> 00:25:31,650
- Submit some. - He got caught.

756
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:33,280
- Submit some. - He answered, "Okay."

757
00:25:33,288 --> 00:25:35,620
- Submit some. - Think about it.

758
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:37,020
If there are 17 candies...

759
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:38,690
You're suddenly talking. You must have submitted less than five.

760
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:39,820
Make up for it now.

761
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,220
- I mean... - If she'd submitted five,

762
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:44,390
she'd be driving us crazy right now.

763
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:46,760
"Why didn't you submit five?"

764
00:25:46,768 --> 00:25:49,430
But she's just smiling. She definitely didn't submit enough.

765
00:25:49,437 --> 00:25:50,730
- For me, - I'm sure.

766
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,270
I already submitted five. I can't submit anymore.

767
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:53,600
Cut it out.

768
00:25:53,608 --> 00:25:54,740
Those who submitted five don't have to submit more, right?

769
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:56,110
Guys, are you having fun?

770
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,570
(Don't leave me out.)

771
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:00,840
(He paid extra attention to his outfit today,)

772
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,780
(but he's been watching the other members from behind the whole time.)

773
00:26:04,786 --> 00:26:06,620
(Are you guys having fun?)

774
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:08,020
- Are you having fun? - Seok Jin.

775
00:26:08,023 --> 00:26:09,550
Pay attention to me.

776
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:11,290
We're doing something important here. Please keep quiet.

777
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,960
It's important for me too.

778
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:15,060
- There are two more rounds. - It's your last chance.

779
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,430
- Okay. - Let's start Round Two.

780
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:18,530
- Let me start. - Haha will go first.

781
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,600
(Haha starts Round 2.)

782
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,200
(Thank you for your microphone cover.)

783
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:23,870
That microphone cover thing was very interesting.

784
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,070
I...

785
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:27,200
already submitted five, so I won't submit any.

786
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:31,470
(As Haha submitted 5 in Round 1, he submits none this time.)

787
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,510
I'm so angry.

788
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,050
I really am.

789
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,545
I trusted at least three of them.

790
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:39,020
(Were we too selfish?)

791
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,980
Gosh, they're all the same. Okay.

792
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,250
Who else submitted five?

793
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:43,920
Let me...

794
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:44,990
You want to go first?

795
00:26:44,993 --> 00:26:48,290
(Shameless)

796
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:49,730
- Come here. - Stop pretending.

797
00:26:49,731 --> 00:26:51,360
I wanted to let it go,

798
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:52,800
- What? - but I've had enough.

799
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,360
- Stop now. - You're going too far.

800
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:55,470
- You want to see my bag? - You go.

801
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,830
Seriously? Can I show them my bag?

802
00:26:56,838 --> 00:26:58,070
- Are you sure? - Can I?

803
00:26:58,073 --> 00:26:59,470
- You go. - You can't show them.

804
00:26:59,474 --> 00:27:00,700
- No? - You can't.

805
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:02,840
- Did you hide some here? - No.

806
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,040
I could show you my bag.

807
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:05,940
You sound so confident. You must be hiding some somewhere.

808
00:27:05,947 --> 00:27:08,180
You shouldn't search his body while shooting.

809
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:09,680
Seriously...

810
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,950
Are you a detective or something?

811
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:12,050
I mean...

812
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:13,120
Gosh.

813
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,620
Why do I have to put up with this?

814
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:16,150
Do you seriously think I'm hiding candies there?

815
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:18,260
(Even I wouldn't do that.)

816
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,320
What are you doing?

817
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:20,360
Is he hiding some in his shoes?

818
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:21,660
Let's just trust him.

819
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:23,090
Gosh.

820
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,390
I can't believe this.

821
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,460
(He has to submit something now.)

822
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:27,155
I'm not even surprised.

823
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:31,300
(Everyone is suspecting and criticizing me.)

824
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,270
- This is your last chance. - Okay.

825
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:34,440
I'll do it.

826
00:27:34,442 --> 00:27:37,970
(This time, I have to submit something.)

827
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:42,075
(I'm submitting just the wrapper.)

828
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:45,020
I can't do this.

829
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,980
(I can't believe myself.)

830
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:48,350
(As Jong Kook submitted 5, he submits nothing this time.)

831
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,915
I pass.

832
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,690
(Rustling)

833
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:54,385
I submitted some, I swear.

834
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:57,160
(Se Chan submits 1 candy.)

835
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:59,100
(Ji Hyo pretends to submit a lot...)

836
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,930
(but submits just 1 in the end.)

837
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:04,030
(Jae Seok submits 2.)

838
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,700
It has to be over 30 this time.

839
00:28:05,707 --> 00:28:07,270
Let's put an end to this.

840
00:28:07,275 --> 00:28:09,840
- After Round Two, - I'm sure we're done.

841
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:11,680
the number of candies submitted is...

842
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,810
- 22. - Gosh.

843
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,350
(It's only 5 more.)

844
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,410
(Whose fault is it?)

845
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,710
- I can't believe it. - I can't believe it.

846
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:18,820
Is it just three more?

847
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,050
I can't...

848
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:22,350
- It's five more? - Seriously...

849
00:28:22,357 --> 00:28:24,250
Someone must have submitted nothing.

850
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:25,920
- Why would you do that? - I mean...

851
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,590
How can someone submit nothing two times in a row?

852
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:28,830
- How can you do that? - I submitted some.

853
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,290
- Why are you doing this? - I submitted some.

854
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:31,800
- What's with you? - I submitted some.

855
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,030
We have to go over 30.

856
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:36,400
Let's at least win a hint.

857
00:28:36,404 --> 00:28:38,070
- Everyone should submit four. - Let's do that.

858
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:40,540
Let's submit four each. Do it now.

859
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,670
- The thing is... - I'll take...

860
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:43,310
- that... - I'll take the penalty!

861
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:44,810
(Jong Kook is angry.)

862
00:28:44,813 --> 00:28:46,240
Submit four!

863
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:47,380
So we can win a hint.

864
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:49,510
- I will. - You should've said so sooner.

865
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,710
Why won't you listen to me?

866
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,375
(It's fun today.)

867
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:55,250
So Min, please turn around. Please turn around.

868
00:28:55,256 --> 00:28:57,450
(Kwang Soo managed to survive.)

869
00:28:57,459 --> 00:29:02,185
(He is submitting only 1, not 4?)

870
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,790
Kwang Soo didn't submit four.

871
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,825
(I can see everything.)

872
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:10,170
- Seok Jin. - He didn't submit four!

873
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:12,540
I'm not done yet.

874
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,000
I saw it.

875
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:15,710
- What's with him? - He didn't submit four.

876
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,070
- I'm not done yet. - What are you doing?

877
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,240
- I'm not done. - He submitted only 1 or 2.

878
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:19,905
Good job.

879
00:29:20,015 --> 00:29:22,905
(He turns in 1 additional piece.)

880
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,820
- He turned in one. - What?

881
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,050
He turned in one.

882
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,945
- My goodness. - Goodness.

883
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:32,790
- What's wrong with him? - He turned in one.

884
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:35,130
- What are you doing? - How many did I turn in?

885
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,090
- Kwang Soo. - I turned them in.

886
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,160
(Kwang Soo turns in another one.)

887
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,200
(If it wasn't for Seok Jin...)

888
00:29:41,202 --> 00:29:44,770
It's fine as long as you aren't last. Turn in four.

889
00:29:44,773 --> 00:29:46,640
- It's not difficult. - Look at the front.

890
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:49,010
It's fun to get clues.

891
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,210
Jae Seok should turn in at least three pieces.

892
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:56,050
(He grabs a lot.)

893
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:57,510
(What is he doing?)

894
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,520
(He keeps them in his cap.)

895
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,975
(Bulging)

896
00:30:01,189 --> 00:30:02,320
(He only turns in one piece.)

897
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:04,790
If we turned in five pieces,

898
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,590
the rest of them should give at least four.

899
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:10,030
You can tell based on how much remains in the pocket.

900
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:13,560
- That's... - The total should be 30.

901
00:30:13,568 --> 00:30:15,530
Jae Seok, your cap is bulging out.

902
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:18,865
(Stop lying, Jae Seok.)

903
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,570
Your cap is bulging out too much.

904
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:24,410
- Wait a minute. - What is that?

905
00:30:24,412 --> 00:30:25,540
What's that?

906
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:27,310
- Gosh. - What's in your cap?

907
00:30:27,315 --> 00:30:28,550
- Stop. - Your head is uneven.

908
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,950
What's that inside?

909
00:30:30,952 --> 00:30:33,420
- Wait a minute. - How many do you have?

910
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:34,850
You're annoying.

911
00:30:34,856 --> 00:30:39,255
I turned in a lot. I really did.

912
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,320
How many pieces are in his cap?

913
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:43,690
(Ji Hyo gives 2 pieces.)

914
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:45,130
I'll give two pieces.

915
00:30:45,133 --> 00:30:48,100
We have to win anyway.

916
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:49,500
Yes.

917
00:30:49,504 --> 00:30:50,630
(Jong Kook gives nothing.)

918
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:52,125
I'm done.

919
00:30:52,474 --> 00:30:53,940
Turn in yours, So Min.

920
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,610
- What? - Do it. I'm watching you.

921
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:57,910
(They succeed if someone turns in 2 pieces.)

922
00:30:57,912 --> 00:31:01,805
(How many did So Min turn in?)

923
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:03,310
Se Chan.

924
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:05,175
(Se Chan and Haha remain.)

925
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,680
(Did someone hide it in here?)

926
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:10,985
Hand them in. Hand more in.

927
00:31:11,392 --> 00:31:14,920
(Did So Min, Se Chan, and Haha turn in a total of 2 pieces?)

928
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:16,230
It's over.

929
00:31:16,231 --> 00:31:18,560
I'll announce the final result.

930
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:20,800
- It has to be 30 pieces. - Goodness.

931
00:31:20,802 --> 00:31:23,300
- Are there over 30 pieces? - Result of Round 3.

932
00:31:23,304 --> 00:31:25,100
The total amount of candy is...

933
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:26,900
(Is it 30 pieces?)

934
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:29,740
(They promised to turn in 5 pieces each.)

935
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:34,580
(They agree to turn in at least 4 pieces.)

936
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:40,150
(It turns into a violent mess. Did they turn in over 30 pieces?)

937
00:31:40,155 --> 00:31:42,520
- It's 29 pieces. - Goodness.

938
00:31:42,524 --> 00:31:44,720
(With 29 pieces, they fail.)

939
00:31:44,726 --> 00:31:46,020
Really?

940
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:48,120
(The member with the least number of candies goes to jail.)

941
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:50,385
Who is it?

942
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:51,390
Tell us how many we have.

943
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,760
- I'll announce first place. - The first place?

944
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,170
(He announces the one who turned in the least.)

945
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,200
Why would you announce that?

946
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:58,370
Who placed first?

947
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:00,370
- Why would you announce it? - I'm not first place.

948
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,010
- The first place is... - Isn't that too harsh?

949
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,270
There's a first place.

950
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:05,540
- 2 people placed first. - 2 people?

951
00:32:05,547 --> 00:32:07,635
- Why would you announce it? - Wait.

952
00:32:07,715 --> 00:32:10,510
- Two people placed first? - I turned mine in.

953
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:12,420
With seven pieces, they placed first.

954
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,920
- 7 pieces? - 7 pieces?

955
00:32:13,922 --> 00:32:15,850
- I knew it. - They turned in one per round.

956
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:17,920
- That's harsh. - I know.

957
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:19,855
The two people are...

958
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:22,230
- Jae Seok and Kwang Soo. - Wait.

959
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,560
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo)

960
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,060
(Two familiar faces)

961
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:27,100
- That was obvious. - Kwang Soo.

962
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:30,030
- I knew it. - How could you?

963
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:31,670
If you had turned in one more...

964
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:35,570
Both So Min and Se Chan have six.

965
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:37,570
- That's right. You too, So Min? - Yes.

966
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:38,910
- I'm conscientious. - Jong Kook told us to turn in four.

967
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,610
What do you mean conscientious?

968
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:41,810
Ji Hyo is great.

969
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:44,010
- I turned in five pieces. - Jong Kook, Haha,

970
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:46,850
and Ji Hyo turned in 5 each. 1 of you...

971
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:49,220
- will go to jail. - Yellow one's going to jail?

972
00:32:49,224 --> 00:32:51,790
- I don't know anymore. - I'll definitely do it next time.

973
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:52,920
Forget it.

974
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,060
- I'll turn it in next round. - One.

975
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:58,290
Open up like this. 1, 2, 3.

976
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:00,600
(Jong Kook goes to jail.)

977
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:03,170
It's Jong Kook. It ended up being him.

978
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,470
He loves to exercise, and he gets to do it here.

979
00:33:05,473 --> 00:33:06,940
He usually does it at the gym.

980
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:09,610
- It must be fate. - Right.

981
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:11,940
(I don't have to go to the gym today.)

982
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,780
- Okay. - He got it.

983
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:15,280
(He goes to Cell 2.)

984
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:16,950
Can I walk faster?

985
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:19,005
He enters jail.

986
00:33:19,854 --> 00:33:22,685
Next question is for Ji Hyo.

987
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:25,120
Truth or Dare?

988
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,920
You should pick truth. If you pick dare...

989
00:33:26,928 --> 00:33:27,960
Dare.

990
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:29,590
(She doesn't hesitate.)

991
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:31,730
- Wait a minute. - Give us a minute.

992
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,330
- If you tell the truth... - No.

993
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:35,000
- Then we can't win. - I don't want to pick truth.

994
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,030
- Ji Hyo. - I don't want to pick truth.

995
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:39,600
- I know how you feel. - I saw Kwang Soo torn into pieces.

996
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:42,170
I don't want to do it. Dare.

997
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:44,305
(What is Ji Hyo's mission?)

998
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,810
- Do you shake? - We don't know what's inside.

999
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:47,810
(As If You're Insane)

1000
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:49,950
- Ji Hyo will do well. - "Shake only the head."

1001
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:53,020
- Goodness. In 20 seconds? - That's amazing.

1002
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:55,120
- Will they come out? - It'll be hard.

1003
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:56,120
Take all of them out?

1004
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:57,120
(It's full of candies.)

1005
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:58,945
Does she flip them?

1006
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,490
- No. - Leave them like this?

1007
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:01,620
How will they come out?

1008
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:03,630
I told you to choose truth.

1009
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:05,530
If you fail this time, the countdown will start.

1010
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:06,900
I told you to choose truth.

1011
00:34:06,901 --> 00:34:08,830
- There's room for three. - No.

1012
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:10,400
No, I can do it.

1013
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:12,300
- You can do it. - If you fail, the countdown begins.

1014
00:34:12,307 --> 00:34:14,670
- She has to do it in a cruel way. - Get ready.

1015
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:15,940
Start.

1016
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:17,435
(Ji Hyo's mission starts.)

1017
00:34:17,478 --> 00:34:20,410
- That's right. That's good. - They're coming out?

1018
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,650
- They come out 1 by 1. - They're coming out, Ji Hyo.

1019
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,720
- One on the left isn't coming out. - Hurry up. Do it faster.

1020
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,480
- That's good. - Do it faster.

1021
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:30,190
- That's right. - Right.

1022
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:31,390
You're insane.

1023
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:33,020
(Ji Hyo is doing well.)

1024
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:35,290
- That's good. - You're almost done.

1025
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:37,290
Keep going. You're almost done.

1026
00:34:37,298 --> 00:34:38,860
You almost got it.

1027
00:34:38,866 --> 00:34:42,400
(Dare is better than truth, right?)

1028
00:34:42,403 --> 00:34:44,800
(She wants to save everyone by winning clues.)

1029
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:48,495
(Her banging of her head is noble.)

1030
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:49,670
(They're almost empty.)

1031
00:34:49,677 --> 00:34:52,040
- A little more. - There's only one left.

1032
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:57,510
- You have 1 left. - 1 is left.

1033
00:34:57,518 --> 00:34:58,820
- Done! - Success.

1034
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,620
(She gets rid of all the candies.)

1035
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:02,345
You got it.

1036
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:05,045
(They're empty.)

1037
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,455
19.77 seconds.

1038
00:35:07,495 --> 00:35:10,130
- I'm so dizzy. - That was impressive.

1039
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:12,430
She was really insane.

1040
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,260
- I can't see well. - That was really surprising.

1041
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:17,670
Dare can be successful.

1042
00:35:17,672 --> 00:35:20,795
- Wait, let's see the clue. - 100 to 100.

1043
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:23,610
- "Being out"? - "Being out can save your friend."

1044
00:35:23,611 --> 00:35:27,810
Someone has to be eliminated to save all of us.

1045
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:29,750
- Is that what it means? - One has to be out.

1046
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:31,945
You have to sacrifice yourself.

1047
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,750
(Which member will be eliminated?)

1048
00:35:35,757 --> 00:35:39,390
Read the chance mission that we prepared.

1049
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:41,390
- Okay, is there a chance? - There's a chance.

1050
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,885
- We need one of these. - Right.

1051
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:46,260
- Do we play once more? - What is it?

1052
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:48,000
- Seok Jin. - What?

1053
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:49,830
- What is it? - Find a Lying Member.

1054
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:53,165
(It can save 1 of the 2.)

1055
00:35:53,408 --> 00:35:55,100
"Eliminated and surviving members..."

1056
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,810
"choose one member to save."

1057
00:35:57,812 --> 00:36:00,910
"When both teams choose the same member, he'll be saved."

1058
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:02,410
"One more clue is given."

1059
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,310
If they choose different members,

1060
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:08,020
one of you will be punished as well.

1061
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:09,590
(Additional member is sent to jail.)

1062
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,820
- We have to... - We must choose the same.

1063
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:14,390
- choose the same member. - Let's choose the same member.

1064
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:16,290
If we pick different members...

1065
00:36:16,297 --> 00:36:18,390
There's nothing to be funny about.

1066
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:19,660
Okay, I got it.

1067
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:23,070
6 of us must choose the same members as 2 of you.

1068
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,995
- Okay. - Okay.

1069
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:26,970
Whom shall we pick?

1070
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:29,570
If we consider consistency,

1071
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:32,410
- it should be Jong Kook. - We should pick Jong Kook.

1072
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:34,010
I don't think he'll yield.

1073
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:36,950
Jong Kook is very comfortable in there.

1074
00:36:36,951 --> 00:36:39,420
He looks like he's working out at a good gym.

1075
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,650
He keeps throwing punches.

1076
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:44,320
- Jong Kook, go easy on me. - Okay.

1077
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:46,560
- Okay. - May I be released, Jong Kook?

1078
00:36:46,561 --> 00:36:49,060
If you get a chance, you should. Do you prefer getting out?

1079
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,290
- Let me get out. - Getting out is better.

1080
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:53,000
- How can I stay? - Getting out is good.

1081
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,600
- You're working out. - Still...

1082
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:57,230
- You're exercising. - I'm hot in here.

1083
00:36:57,238 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm about to lose my mind the longer I stay here.

1084
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,940
- Let me get out. - Have you made up your mind?

1085
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:03,510
- Let me get out. - What?

1086
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,510
We're arguing right now.

1087
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:08,410
They're arguing. He said, "Getting out is better."

1088
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,950
Shall we change our decision?

1089
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:11,650
He wants to stay in.

1090
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:13,815
Jong Kook said that he's hot.

1091
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:15,620
Have you decided?

1092
00:37:15,623 --> 00:37:18,120
- We agreed. - Are you ready?

1093
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,620
(They agree on who gets out.)

1094
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:21,420
If we fail, one more goes in.

1095
00:37:21,429 --> 00:37:23,230
- It's over once you go in. - I know.

1096
00:37:23,231 --> 00:37:26,000
Please, guys.

1097
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,700
- Yes? - We made an agreement.

1098
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,870
1, 2, 3.

1099
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:32,870
(What did they agree on?)

1100
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:38,135
(Whom did Jong Kook and Seok Jin choose?)

1101
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,780
(Their choices agree.)

1102
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:45,380
(Seok Jin finally gets released and stands before the camera.)

1103
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:47,315
I'm finally getting out.

1104
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:49,550
- Jong Kook is doing well inside. - Right.

1105
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:52,020
- Jong Kook is very well. - I'll get another chance.

1106
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:54,120
- Thank you. - Do your feet hurt a lot?

1107
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:55,760
They hurt a lot.

1108
00:37:55,763 --> 00:37:57,790
- I'm impressed by your loyalty. - Thank you.

1109
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:59,725
- We get a hint. - We're loyal.

1110
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,660
- Jong Kook, hang in there. - Okay, Seok Jin.

1111
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:02,830
Show it to us.

1112
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:05,270
"Game Is over When Everyone Stays in Their Places." What?

1113
00:38:05,273 --> 00:38:06,970
(Fourth clue)

1114
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,570
Everyone stays in their places.

1115
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:10,770
- Let me see the last 1. - "100 to 100".

1116
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:12,840
- We shot 100 to 100 before. - Wait.

1117
00:38:12,847 --> 00:38:16,050
- "Only Jae Seok"... - "Takes care of Seok Jin".

1118
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,950
- "Being out can"... - "Being out can save your friend."

1119
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,615
"Game is over when everyone stays in their places."

1120
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,950
- We have to do something. - What's this?

1121
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,685
- What does it mean? - Where is our place?

1122
00:38:26,794 --> 00:38:29,660
Stand in the order of your age.

1123
00:38:29,664 --> 00:38:32,230
- Doesn't it mean our age? - I don't think so.

1124
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:34,030
Does anyone become 100 years old when you add something?

1125
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,600
- 100 to 100. - 100 years old?

1126
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:38,770
- It's 100 years old each. - Our total age is over 100.

1127
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:40,900
There are about 5 100-year-olds.

1128
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:43,170
- It's 100 to 100. - It's 2 by 2.

1129
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,410
Our total age is over 100.

1130
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:47,010
We need more clues.

1131
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:49,775
The game is done when we're in our places?

1132
00:38:49,984 --> 00:38:51,610
Jong Kook, hang in there. We'll save you.

1133
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,020
(What do the clues mean?)

1134
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,050
It's time for another question.

1135
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:58,590
- Next up is Se Chan. - Is it me?

1136
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,455
It's Se Chan.

1137
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:03,330
- Truth or Dare? - Pick truth.

1138
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:05,030
- Pick truth. - Pick truth.

1139
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:06,800
- I'll choose... - You should pick truth.

1140
00:39:06,801 --> 00:39:08,660
- Dare will be hard. - I don't think I can do it.

1141
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:09,930
Truth.

1142
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:11,400
Se Chan is honest.

1143
00:39:11,405 --> 00:39:13,565
He has nothing to hide.

1144
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,070
(Pick another member whom you'll answer truthfully with.)

1145
00:39:17,078 --> 00:39:19,710
(If everyone tells the truth, they win a hint.)

1146
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:21,080
Pick someone honest.

1147
00:39:21,082 --> 00:39:23,150
Seok Jin is very honest.

1148
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,875
I just got out.

1149
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,420
I just got out.

1150
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,650
- I choose Seok Jin. - Just tell the truth.

1151
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:28,920
- I choose Seok Jin. - Tell the truth.

1152
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:29,990
- I choose Seok Jin. - No!

1153
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,250
Just tell the truth.

1154
00:39:31,258 --> 00:39:33,390
- You just have to tell the truth. - I can't!

1155
00:39:33,394 --> 00:39:34,820
Just tell the truth.

1156
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:35,930
I just got out.

1157
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,260
Just tell the truth.

1158
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:38,560
- Gosh. - You don't have to go back in.

1159
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:39,730
Okay.

1160
00:39:39,734 --> 00:39:40,830
Okay. Seok Jin.

1161
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:42,870
(Seok Jin has to tell the truth.)

1162
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,495
You're amazing.

1163
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,440
It'd be so funny if he has to lie.

1164
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:49,010
Let me see the question first.

1165
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,110
His nose is big,

1166
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:51,870
but his nostrils are small.

1167
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,180
(His nose is big, but his nostrils are small.)

1168
00:39:54,181 --> 00:39:55,650
- Heung Bu. - Okay.

1169
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,280
I just need to tell the truth, right?

1170
00:39:57,284 --> 00:39:58,880
I'll tell the truth.

1171
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:01,680
- That's right. - Take off your glasses.

1172
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,250
If you lie,

1173
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:05,590
- I'm nervous. - whipped cream will be splashed...

1174
00:40:05,593 --> 00:40:06,790
- and... - I'll be out.

1175
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:08,560
you'll go to the cell with ice water and a chin-up bar.

1176
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:10,430
(He'll be splashed and sent to the cell with ice water.)

1177
00:40:10,431 --> 00:40:13,600
(I'll tell the truth.)

1178
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,030
This show cares so much...

1179
00:40:16,037 --> 00:40:18,030
about Seok Jin's health.

1180
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,700
They make him stand on the massage board and...

1181
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:21,000
- He can just tell the truth. - Yes.

1182
00:40:21,008 --> 00:40:23,310
A cold shower is very good for you too.

1183
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,840
I'll definitely tell the truth.

1184
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:27,680
It was so painful to be in the cell.

1185
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:29,610
This question is about...

1186
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:31,510
a secret Haha knows.

1187
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:33,520
(It's a secret Haha knows about Seok Jin.)

1188
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:35,180
It's about Seok Jin.

1189
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:36,985
What do you know about me?

1190
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:39,890
- I didn't write anything serious. - Really?

1191
00:40:39,894 --> 00:40:42,020
Okay. I'm going to tell the truth.

1192
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,530
(I'm a bit worried.)

1193
00:40:43,531 --> 00:40:44,830
About four weeks ago,

1194
00:40:44,832 --> 00:40:47,300
you were waiting for a Running Man shoot.

1195
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,730
You said something that shocked the other members...

1196
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:54,335
and made your stylist cry. What was it?

1197
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:55,710
(I think I know.)

1198
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,310
I know.

1199
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,080
What is it?

1200
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,140
What did I say?

1201
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:02,180
Yes, that's the one.

1202
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:03,510
- That's the one? - Yes.

1203
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:04,710
That's right.

1204
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,480
- What? - I remember it.

1205
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:08,720
He said...

1206
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:10,790
he wanted to be on a certain show.

1207
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,320
(Seok Jin said he wanted to be on a certain show.)

1208
00:41:13,327 --> 00:41:14,960
We all said, "What?"

1209
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:16,485
"Are you serious?"

1210
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,890
Gosh.

1211
00:41:17,898 --> 00:41:19,525
Hey!

1212
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,625
Haha!

1213
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:24,400
- It's up to you. - Seriously...

1214
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,970
Seriously... It must be so hard to decide.

1215
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:29,310
I haven't been sleeping well since that day.

1216
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:30,710
I was so shocked.

1217
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:32,240
(What shocked Kwang Soo so much?)

1218
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:34,540
Are you going to tell the truth?

1219
00:41:34,548 --> 00:41:36,445
Tell the truth,

1220
00:41:36,917 --> 00:41:38,380
or you'll be penalized.

1221
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:39,680
Of course, it was just a joke.

1222
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:41,220
It was.

1223
00:41:41,222 --> 00:41:42,220
(Why did I make such a joke?)

1224
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:44,345
When Seok Jin goes home,

1225
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:46,460
his wife will say, "Seok Jin, you're out."

1226
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,720
(Seok Jin's wife will say he's out.)

1227
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:49,930
- "You're out." - That's possible.

1228
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,560
He'll be out either at home or here.

1229
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,460
(Seok Jin faces a dilemma.)

1230
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:58,900
Tell the truth within five seconds, or you'll be penalized.

1231
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:01,040
- It's okay. She'll understand. - Five...

1232
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:03,570
What should I do? I just got out.

1233
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:04,870
- Gosh. - All right.

1234
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:07,740
(He might have to go into the ice water bucket.)

1235
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:11,045
(I'm sorry.)

1236
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:12,750
(Okay. I'll tell the truth.)

1237
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:14,745
I said,

1238
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:15,920
"Gosh..."

1239
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:21,085
(Exclaiming)

1240
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:23,360
You have to think.

1241
00:42:23,364 --> 00:42:24,960
You have to think a lot.

1242
00:42:24,965 --> 00:42:28,325
"Oh, there's a show I want to do."

1243
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:32,300
(Will he tell the shocking truth?)

1244
00:42:32,306 --> 00:42:33,800
Which show?

1245
00:42:33,808 --> 00:42:34,970
"Gosh..."

1246
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:38,240
(Exclaiming)

1247
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:39,840
"I want to be on 'Flaming Youth'."

1248
00:42:39,847 --> 00:42:44,350
(I want to be on "Flaming Youth".)

1249
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,020
("Flaming Youth" airs at 11:10pm on SBS every Tuesday.)

1250
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,880
I was just joking.

1251
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:50,290
(It's a show where middle-aged singles make friends.)

1252
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,360
(He actually said it!)

1253
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,760
I was just joking!

1254
00:42:55,763 --> 00:42:57,930
- Su Jeong, I was just joking! - Turn off the sound!

1255
00:42:57,932 --> 00:43:00,060
- I was just joking! - Turn off the sound!

1256
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,300
(You should probably sleep here tonight.)

1257
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:03,225
- I mean... - That's too bad.

1258
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:04,730
It was really a joke.

1259
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:06,470
- "Flaming Youth". - He told the truth.

1260
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:07,570
He did.

1261
00:43:07,575 --> 00:43:08,970
Those cells are awful.

1262
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:10,970
- It's terrible. - He told the truth.

1263
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:13,140
- Now we can win a hint. - Seriously...

1264
00:43:13,147 --> 00:43:15,280
(Thank you for your sacrifice.)

1265
00:43:15,282 --> 00:43:18,375
Let's just choose dare from now on.

1266
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:19,880
The truth hurts too much.

1267
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,280
It does.

1268
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,420
- Se Chan. - Yes.

1269
00:43:22,423 --> 00:43:25,490
If you tell the truth, we can win a hint.

1270
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:26,720
Here we go, Se Chan.

1271
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:27,920
I can tell the truth.

1272
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:31,590
While Se Chan answers the question, can we have Jong Kook's door open?

1273
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:32,660
What?

1274
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:35,360
- Is it about Jong Kook? - What is it?

1275
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:36,370
Okay.

1276
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:38,570
It feels much better with the door open.

1277
00:43:38,572 --> 00:43:40,100
Se Chan's question must be related to you.

1278
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:41,840
- Really? - Can you hear us well?

1279
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:42,910
Yes.

1280
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,670
- Here we go. - What is it?

1281
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:45,940
What could it be?

1282
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:48,410
- It's a secret Kwang Soo knows... - Me?

1283
00:43:48,415 --> 00:43:50,010
about Se Chan.

1284
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:51,110
What is it?

1285
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:52,150
(Oh, it's that one.)

1286
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:55,420
You always take screenshots of the shows Jong Kook is on...

1287
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:58,685
and send them.

1288
00:43:58,692 --> 00:44:01,755
He is the president of my celebrity fan club.

1289
00:44:01,762 --> 00:44:03,990
When Kwang Soo asked you if it was fun,

1290
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:05,460
what did you answer?

1291
00:44:05,466 --> 00:44:10,395
(What did he answer to the question, "Was it fun?")

1292
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:12,370
I don't want to be here.

1293
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:13,800
(Haha is scared.)

1294
00:44:13,807 --> 00:44:16,570
(You texted me this.)

1295
00:44:16,577 --> 00:44:18,010
(I can't say that.)

1296
00:44:18,012 --> 00:44:19,380
(When I asked him how he could watch all Jong Kook's shows...)

1297
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,580
I can't say that.

1298
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,975
- Not this. - You're so mean.

1299
00:44:23,217 --> 00:44:24,950
- I think I know. - No.

1300
00:44:24,952 --> 00:44:26,980
I don't think I can say it.

1301
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:28,420
We need a hint.

1302
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:29,920
We have to get out of here.

1303
00:44:29,924 --> 00:44:32,120
I even mentioned "Flaming Youth".

1304
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:33,920
I didn't want to tell anyone, but...

1305
00:44:33,928 --> 00:44:37,385
(If I tell the truth, that monster will come after me.)

1306
00:44:37,498 --> 00:44:41,055
(Between the truth and survival, what will Se Chan choose?)

1307
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:44,425
"I can watch his shows because I like him so much."

1308
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:47,540
(How can he be so shameless?)

1309
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,310
- It's no problem. - You must want to survive.

1310
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:53,975
(He is penalized for his lie.)

1311
00:44:54,048 --> 00:44:55,680
(Here, both lies and truths hurt.)

1312
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:57,210
It hurt.

1313
00:44:57,217 --> 00:44:59,550
- The wind hurt. - The thing is,

1314
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:01,080
the cream completely melted.

1315
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:03,190
It must have been something you couldn't say.

1316
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,550
(For Se Chan's safety, we'll protect the secret.)

1317
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:06,020
Se Chan.

1318
00:45:06,026 --> 00:45:07,790
Se Chan, you're out.

1319
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:10,285
(Se Chan is sent to jail.)

1320
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:12,860
(You know...)

1321
00:45:12,866 --> 00:45:14,030
(how I always want to be close to you, right?)

1322
00:45:14,034 --> 00:45:15,100
It's so cold.

1323
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:16,130
Se Chan.

1324
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:18,765
He must feel so uncomfortable right now.

1325
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,540
Let me ask all of you.

1326
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:24,340
Truth or Dare?

1327
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:25,470
- Dare! - Dare!

1328
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:26,510
1, 2, 3.

1329
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:28,110
- Dare! - Dare!

1330
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:29,780
- Never choose truth. - Who would choose truth?

1331
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:30,910
We can't do this.

1332
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:32,610
Our friendship got hurt.

1333
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:34,080
- Let's not choose truth. - We have to choose dare.

1334
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:35,150
- We have to choose dare. - Definitely.

1335
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:36,320
We can't say anything more.

1336
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:38,785
Blowing Eggs.

1337
00:45:39,093 --> 00:45:41,020
"All surviving members have to participate."

1338
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:43,830
"Within 100 seconds, you'll take turns."

1339
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,430
"Blow eggs upside down."

1340
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:47,900
(Blow 10 eggs upside down.)

1341
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:49,060
It's hard.

1342
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:50,130
Practice.

1343
00:45:50,137 --> 00:45:51,695
(They start practicing.)

1344
00:45:52,106 --> 00:45:53,570
That's not how you do it.

1345
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:55,000
(Blowing)

1346
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:57,170
- I feel dizzy. - Gosh.

1347
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:58,470
Move your head.

1348
00:45:58,479 --> 00:46:00,010
So Min!

1349
00:46:00,014 --> 00:46:02,105
That's not how you do it.

1350
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:03,550
- Hey! - I can't do this.

1351
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,550
That's not how you do it.

1352
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:06,650
Blow here.

1353
00:46:06,653 --> 00:46:07,980
(The egg hits Seok Jin's nose.)

1354
00:46:07,988 --> 00:46:10,220
(My nose hurts.)

1355
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:12,285
(The egg hits Kwang Soo's nose too.)

1356
00:46:12,593 --> 00:46:14,220
(Those with big noses might get hurt.)

1357
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:16,030
It keeps hitting my nose.

1358
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,555
Gosh.

1359
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,595
Guys, you should move your head.

1360
00:46:22,836 --> 00:46:25,100
(Jae Seok figures out the right way.)

1361
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,795
Move your head.

1362
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:28,295
When?

1363
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:32,105
(Will Jae Seok's tip help Kwang Soo succeed?)

1364
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:33,810
(The egg breaks.)

1365
00:46:33,814 --> 00:46:35,980
(The raw egg gets all over Kwang Soo's face.)

1366
00:46:35,983 --> 00:46:37,905
Gosh.

1367
00:46:38,152 --> 00:46:41,950
(He blows hard enough, but he moves too slowly.)

1368
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:43,350
What are you doing?

1369
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:44,690
Was it raw?

1370
00:46:44,691 --> 00:46:46,185
Were they raw eggs?

1371
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:49,285
(The practice is over.)

1372
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:50,790
Ready.

1373
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:52,285
(Blow 10 eggs upside down within 100 seconds.)

1374
00:46:52,299 --> 00:46:54,225
(Haha starts.)

1375
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:59,865
(1 is done.)

1376
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:03,465
(It's not going well.)

1377
00:47:03,644 --> 00:47:06,005
(I should step in.)

1378
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,480
Jae Seok, go.

1379
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:09,310
(Jae Seok takes over.)

1380
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:12,380
(He knows how to succeed.)

1381
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:15,450
(During the practice)

1382
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:17,320
(Blow and move!)

1383
00:47:17,324 --> 00:47:21,715
(Blowing 9 eggs upside down would be no problem.)

1384
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:25,255
- Gosh. - Move on.

1385
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:28,425
Gosh.

1386
00:47:29,236 --> 00:47:30,900
What are you doing?

1387
00:47:30,904 --> 00:47:32,530
Two.

1388
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,200
- Gosh. - What's with you?

1389
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,840
Why are you blowing so hard?

1390
00:47:35,843 --> 00:47:37,270
Gosh.

1391
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:38,470
Hey.

1392
00:47:38,479 --> 00:47:40,640
What is this?

1393
00:47:40,647 --> 00:47:43,650
(The landing and the sound are impeccable.)

1394
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,780
How many are you going to break?

1395
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:47,215
- What are you doing? - How many are they?

1396
00:47:47,688 --> 00:47:49,050
(2 are done.)

1397
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:50,950
- There you go. - Two are done.

1398
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:53,985
Look at the mess they make!

1399
00:47:54,595 --> 00:47:57,225
(Seok Jin is the 3rd player.)

1400
00:47:57,831 --> 00:48:00,530
(His nose gets in the way, and he doesn't blow hard enough.)

1401
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:02,195
What are you doing?

1402
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:03,970
Okay.

1403
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,330
Hurry up!

1404
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,040
We don't have much time.

1405
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,395
Hurry up! We don't have much time.

1406
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,770
Yes!

1407
00:48:10,777 --> 00:48:12,740
(He gets the 3rd egg upside down.)

1408
00:48:12,746 --> 00:48:13,910
All right.

1409
00:48:13,914 --> 00:48:15,010
Ji Hyo.

1410
00:48:15,015 --> 00:48:16,040
Good.

1411
00:48:16,049 --> 00:48:17,450
Keep going.

1412
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:20,020
(Ji Hyo gets the 4th egg upside down right away.)

1413
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,520
Ji Hyo is good at it.

1414
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:24,415
(She gets the 5th egg upside down too.)

1415
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,720
- Yes! - Keep going.

1416
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:27,860
(Blowing)

1417
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,655
Gosh.

1418
00:48:29,796 --> 00:48:31,090
(He gets the 7th egg upside down by chance.)

1419
00:48:31,098 --> 00:48:32,230
- I did it! - Good.

1420
00:48:32,232 --> 00:48:33,760
Hurry up.

1421
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,000
Just two more.

1422
00:48:35,002 --> 00:48:36,200
- Good! - Hurry up.

1423
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:37,530
- One more. - Hurry up!

1424
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:38,870
Hurry up!

1425
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:41,640
(Two more to go...)

1426
00:48:41,642 --> 00:48:42,700
(until 10)

1427
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:44,440
Just one more.

1428
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:46,070
(Let me show you.)

1429
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,240
(There's 25 seconds left.)

1430
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:48,875
Hurry up!

1431
00:48:48,982 --> 00:48:53,345
(It's not going well.)

1432
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:54,980
Here.

1433
00:48:54,988 --> 00:48:56,790
(Seok Jin tries again.)

1434
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,850
Hurry up!

1435
00:48:57,858 --> 00:48:59,250
Put it down.

1436
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:00,815
Gosh.

1437
00:49:01,395 --> 00:49:02,620
My goodness.

1438
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:05,460
(He breaks another egg.)

1439
00:49:05,465 --> 00:49:07,560
(I have to do this.)

1440
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:08,600
Okay!

1441
00:49:08,602 --> 00:49:09,730
You did it.

1442
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:11,900
(With 11 seconds left, there's 1 more egg to go.)

1443
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:14,595
(Will Kwang Soo succeed?)

1444
00:49:14,775 --> 00:49:15,900
Gosh.

1445
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:19,510
(He gets splashed again.)

1446
00:49:19,513 --> 00:49:21,175
What did you do?

1447
00:49:21,448 --> 00:49:22,480
Hey.

1448
00:49:22,482 --> 00:49:27,475
(While Kwang Soo makes a mistake, Haha makes a quick attempt.)

1449
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:31,745
(Will they succeed?)

1450
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:34,120
- What are you doing? - I got it.

1451
00:49:34,127 --> 00:49:36,655
(Haha succeeds.)

1452
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:38,330
(They win a clue.)

1453
00:49:38,332 --> 00:49:39,925
It was a success.

1454
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:41,955
You got all 10.

1455
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:44,900
(I also did my best.)

1456
00:49:44,905 --> 00:49:46,495
We got it.

1457
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:49,100
Many of them bounced off.

1458
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:50,705
Take your hint.

1459
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:53,010
- What? - "Bird that flies high sees far"?

1460
00:49:53,013 --> 00:49:55,310
(What does it mean?)

1461
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:58,875
"Bird that flies high sees far".

1462
00:49:58,986 --> 00:50:00,050
"100 versus 100".

1463
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:01,180
(How is it related to the previous hints?)

1464
00:50:01,188 --> 00:50:03,545
"Bird that flies high sees far".

1465
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:09,320
(Wait a minute.)

1466
00:50:09,329 --> 00:50:13,230
(Is there something high up?)

1467
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,760
"Bird that flies high sees far".

1468
00:50:14,768 --> 00:50:16,765
(Something might be hidden up there.)

1469
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:18,900
- Is there anything up there? - Let's look.

1470
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:21,540
(Let's go upstairs first.)

1471
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:22,940
Is there a hint outside?

1472
00:50:22,943 --> 00:50:24,170
(Only Jae Seok takes care of Seok Jin.)

1473
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:25,640
(100 versus 100)

1474
00:50:25,646 --> 00:50:27,210
Do we have to be high up?

1475
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:28,735
This is scary.

1476
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:31,980
- "Being out..." - "Being out saves your friend."

1477
00:50:31,985 --> 00:50:33,620
"saves your friend."

1478
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,875
(Looking around)

1479
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:37,590
(What's this?)

1480
00:50:37,591 --> 00:50:40,685
- What is it? - What is it?

1481
00:50:41,094 --> 00:50:42,685
- What's this? - It's a scale.

1482
00:50:42,763 --> 00:50:44,325
It's a scale.

1483
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:46,360
- Right, it's a scale. - That's right.

1484
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:47,460
It's a scale.

1485
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:48,760
There are three.

1486
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:51,695
(There's a drawing of a scale on the floor.)

1487
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,240
There are 3 R Stickers. There are 2 on this side.

1488
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:55,740
(They're on top of the scale.)

1489
00:50:55,742 --> 00:51:00,340
(There are 3 and 2 R Stickers.)

1490
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:02,480
- It's a scale. - 3 and 2 people should stand.

1491
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:03,650
3 and 2.

1492
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,575
There are three R Stickers.

1493
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,320
It's 100 to 100.

1494
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:08,380
- It's our weight. - 100 to 100.

1495
00:51:08,388 --> 00:51:09,990
100 to 100.

1496
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,050
What's "100 to 100"?

1497
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:12,120
We have to stay in our places.

1498
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,790
- Right. - This must be the place.

1499
00:51:13,794 --> 00:51:15,860
- There are 3 and 2. - 3 and 2.

1500
00:51:15,862 --> 00:51:16,960
(Will they figure out how to escape?)

1501
00:51:16,963 --> 00:51:18,585
Wait, look.

1502
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,555
Look.

1503
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:24,470
2 and 3 people go to each side. Make it 100 to 100.

1504
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,740
- Do you mean 100kg? - Yes, 100kg.

1505
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,240
That's...

1506
00:51:28,241 --> 00:51:30,340
(Three people's weight can't equal 100kg.)

1507
00:51:30,344 --> 00:51:31,770
100kg isn't possible.

1508
00:51:31,778 --> 00:51:33,635
Shall we make our total age 100?

1509
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:36,675
- Shall we make our total age 100? - Age?

1510
00:51:36,683 --> 00:51:38,210
We can make our total age 100.

1511
00:51:38,218 --> 00:51:39,820
"Only Jae Seok takes care of Seok Jin."

1512
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,020
(That's it.)

1513
00:51:42,022 --> 00:51:44,185
- Our total age equals 100. - You and I work.

1514
00:51:44,257 --> 00:51:45,690
Is it 100? How old are you?

1515
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:47,290
- I'm 47 years old. - It's 100.

1516
00:51:47,294 --> 00:51:48,920
- You're 53. - Hey.

1517
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:50,190
- Wait. - The total is 100.

1518
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:51,590
It must be our age.

1519
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:52,630
(They have figured it out.)

1520
00:51:52,632 --> 00:51:53,960
I told you before.

1521
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:55,700
I'm 40 years old.

1522
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:56,930
I'm 33.

1523
00:51:56,937 --> 00:51:58,900
- I'm 34. - 3 people should stand here.

1524
00:51:58,905 --> 00:52:00,140
- Wait. - This is for three people.

1525
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,440
- 34 plus... - 33.

1526
00:52:03,443 --> 00:52:04,470
(34 plus 33)

1527
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:06,410
- It's me, So Min, and Se Chan! - Se Chan!

1528
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:08,180
Me, So Min, and Se Chan make 100.

1529
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:10,545
We need to release him.

1530
00:52:10,784 --> 00:52:11,810
(Se Chan should be released.)

1531
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:13,220
- He can't come out. - We must take him out.

1532
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,380
- That's right. - Our total age is 100.

1533
00:52:15,389 --> 00:52:16,490
- Really? - We need three people.

1534
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,320
He must be released.

1535
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:19,550
- That's right. - He can't come out.

1536
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:20,990
We need him.

1537
00:52:20,994 --> 00:52:23,290
Someone has to switch places with him.

1538
00:52:23,296 --> 00:52:24,430
We must save him.

1539
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:25,925
("Being out saves your friend," is an important clue.)

1540
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,570
(Will they figure out the secret to this game?)

1541
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,870
Was it "Being out saves your friend"?

1542
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:36,470
- You should get eliminated now. - No, I must stay here.

1543
00:52:36,476 --> 00:52:38,035
(He must stay with Seok Jin.)

1544
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:43,450
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok must stay on the scale.)

1545
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:46,010
(Jae Seok shouldn't go to jail.)

1546
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:49,050
I should be eliminated.

1547
00:52:49,055 --> 00:52:50,090
(Haha must go to jail.)

1548
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,790
- Haha. - I must be out.

1549
00:52:51,792 --> 00:52:53,020
That's his place.

1550
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:54,890
Two of us must stay here.

1551
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:59,530
My place wasn't here. It was over there.

1552
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:01,260
That means...

1553
00:53:01,268 --> 00:53:02,300
(Ji Hyo, Haha, and Jong Kook must stay in jail.)

1554
00:53:02,302 --> 00:53:04,330
Haha, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo must be in jail.

1555
00:53:04,337 --> 00:53:05,430
- That's right. - Right.

1556
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:06,800
That's why it's three.

1557
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:08,470
Haha and Jong Kook.

1558
00:53:08,475 --> 00:53:09,540
(Jong Kook plus Ji Hyo)

1559
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:11,670
The total age of Haha, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo is 121 years.

1560
00:53:11,678 --> 00:53:14,810
(Their total age is 121 years.)

1561
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:16,110
Really?

1562
00:53:16,116 --> 00:53:17,580
That's right.

1563
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:18,950
It's 121 years.

1564
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:19,980
(The answer was age.)

1565
00:53:19,986 --> 00:53:21,615
It was our age.

1566
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:25,515
It's resident registration number. Men are 1, and women are 2.

1567
00:53:25,592 --> 00:53:27,390
(Ji Hyo goes to jail number 2.)

1568
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:28,520
- That's right. - Right?

1569
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:29,760
Look at that.

1570
00:53:29,763 --> 00:53:31,030
I must switch with Jong Kook.

1571
00:53:31,031 --> 00:53:32,755
We got everything.

1572
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:34,200
- Right. - That's right.

1573
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:35,730
- I got goose bumps. - This is amazing.

1574
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:36,830
(How will they open Cell One?)

1575
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:38,070
- Seriously. - By the way,

1576
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:40,140
how will we get Jong Kook out and put Ji Hyo inside?

1577
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,840
- Should we play Truth or Dare? - We must lose.

1578
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:45,370
Our failure won't release Jong Kook.

1579
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:48,580
This is how we can escape this room. Wasn't there a secret?

1580
00:53:48,582 --> 00:53:50,310
(Do you remember what was written on the invitation?)

1581
00:53:50,317 --> 00:53:52,580
"Dangerous Choice, Truth or Dare."

1582
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:55,350
"When three members are out, the timer starts."

1583
00:53:55,355 --> 00:53:57,150
"If you don't figure out a way..."

1584
00:53:57,157 --> 00:54:00,385
"to end the game until the time is up, everyone is out."

1585
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:03,260
- All cells must be occupied. - That's right.

1586
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,390
- They should be occupied. - Let's do that.

1587
00:54:04,397 --> 00:54:05,590
I'll go inside.

1588
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,830
They must be full.

1589
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:08,495
We figured out everything.

1590
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:10,665
Summer before marriage.

1591
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,825
Last summer?

1592
00:54:12,939 --> 00:54:14,465
I was...

1593
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:16,965
Choi Soo Jong.

1594
00:54:17,577 --> 00:54:19,310
(He says a blatant lie.)

1595
00:54:19,312 --> 00:54:24,005
(This is how the big picture becomes reality.)

1596
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,575
We got it.

1597
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:27,280
(Haha goes to jail intentionally.)

1598
00:54:27,287 --> 00:54:29,680
Many things happened during the summer before marriage.

1599
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:32,820
Now, three cells are occupied.

1600
00:54:32,826 --> 00:54:34,615
We must do it now.

1601
00:54:35,095 --> 00:54:39,625
(All 3 cells are occupied.)

1602
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:42,830
Let's find our places.

1603
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:43,900
(The time limit is 10 minutes.)

1604
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:45,170
What's going on?

1605
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:46,230
That startled me.

1606
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:47,600
(The time limit is 10 minutes.)

1607
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:51,665
(The timer is on for 10 minutes.)

1608
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,240
The game has started!

1609
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,280
(The countdown starts.)

1610
00:54:54,281 --> 00:54:55,880
Where's the key?

1611
00:54:55,882 --> 00:54:57,310
- How can he get out? - Can you open the door?

1612
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,045
Can you open the door?

1613
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:01,350
- How can we save him? - There's something else.

1614
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:02,875
What's this?

1615
00:55:03,056 --> 00:55:05,050
- What's this? - It's a seesaw.

1616
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:06,050
(It's a real seesaw.)

1617
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:08,015
- What is this for? - Is it a real seesaw?

1618
00:55:08,328 --> 00:55:10,130
It doesn't measure our age. Is it our weight?

1619
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:11,360
Is it our weight?

1620
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:14,460
(What does a seesaw have to do with opening the cell?)

1621
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:15,530
It's your last mission.

1622
00:55:15,535 --> 00:55:16,600
(Their last mission is given.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1623
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:18,265
- Bring it. - Take a look.

1624
00:55:19,673 --> 00:55:21,240
"Balance the Seesaw".

1625
00:55:21,241 --> 00:55:23,140
"All surviving members get on."

1626
00:55:23,143 --> 00:55:25,670
"Balance the seesaw and maintain it over three seconds."

1627
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:28,875
"Then the cell doors open."

1628
00:55:29,249 --> 00:55:30,510
The cell doors should open.

1629
00:55:30,517 --> 00:55:32,450
- Then switch places. - Right.

1630
00:55:32,452 --> 00:55:35,350
- We have to balance it. - I weigh about 62kg.

1631
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,390
- I weigh about 76kg. - 76kg?

1632
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,650
I weigh 72kg.

1633
00:55:38,658 --> 00:55:40,360
I weigh 49kg.

1634
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,090
Kwang Soo and Seok Jin should go over there.

1635
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:44,790
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin are on one side.)

1636
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:47,030
- Right. - We'll stand here.

1637
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:49,300
Let's balance it with the distance.

1638
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:50,870
Get off, So Min.

1639
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,525
I'll get on first.

1640
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Sit in the back.

1641
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:56,740
(Finding the balance quickly is key.)

1642
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:58,140
Let's see. Get on.

1643
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,265
- Hurry up. - I will...

1644
00:56:00,714 --> 00:56:03,810
(Time keeps passing.)

1645
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:05,250
Let's see.

1646
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:06,250
We got it.

1647
00:56:06,252 --> 00:56:07,880
- Wait a minute. - Keep it for three seconds.

1648
00:56:07,887 --> 00:56:09,120
- One. - Wait a minute.

1649
00:56:09,122 --> 00:56:10,490
- Wait. - Wait.

1650
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,690
Come forward, Seok Jin.

1651
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:13,090
- Wait. - Kwang Soo, go forward.

1652
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:14,855
- So Min. - Come forward, Seok Jin.

1653
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:16,360
Are we heavier?

1654
00:56:16,363 --> 00:56:17,630
Hold still.

1655
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,160
That won't work.

1656
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:20,900
(Finding the balance isn't easy.)

1657
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,830
Go back, Ji Hyo.

1658
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:24,630
If I do this, we're too heavy.

1659
00:56:24,638 --> 00:56:26,200
Go forward, Kwang Soo.

1660
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:28,265
Ji Hyo, come forward.

1661
00:56:28,441 --> 00:56:29,700
- Come as much as possible. - Shall I go?

1662
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:31,810
- Yes. - Go forward, So Min.

1663
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:34,680
(He floats.)

1664
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,810
Wait a minute.

1665
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:36,850
(Jae Seok got startled.)

1666
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:38,650
- Wait. - Why didn't you warn him?

1667
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,480
You should have warned him.

1668
00:56:40,487 --> 00:56:42,750
(Keep your manners.)

1669
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:44,090
How much do you weigh, So Min?

1670
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:45,450
- I weigh... - Put your feet up.

1671
00:56:45,458 --> 00:56:47,090
- 55kg? - I weigh 54kg.

1672
00:56:47,093 --> 00:56:50,190
(Hesitant)

1673
00:56:50,196 --> 00:56:51,630
- You said you weigh 49kg. - What?

1674
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:53,760
You said you weigh 49kg.

1675
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:55,060
I weigh 54kg.

1676
00:56:55,068 --> 00:56:56,900
You said your weight was 49kg.

1677
00:56:56,903 --> 00:56:58,665
Wait a minute.

1678
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:00,440
Hold it.

1679
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,540
- We got it. - Don't be tense.

1680
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,070
- Relax. - Don't be tense, Kwang Soo.

1681
00:57:04,077 --> 00:57:05,970
- Go forward a little. - Relax.

1682
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:07,180
Go back.

1683
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:08,380
(Will they make it in 3.5 minutes?)

1684
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:10,580
Go back a little. You got it.

1685
00:57:10,583 --> 00:57:14,315
1, 2, 3.

1686
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:16,790
(They successfully balance the seesaw.)

1687
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,220
We got it!

1688
00:57:18,224 --> 00:57:19,320
It was a success.

1689
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:20,390
Success.

1690
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:21,960
Switch places.

1691
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:23,020
Good job.

1692
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:25,190
Everyone, go to your places.

1693
00:57:25,198 --> 00:57:26,930
(Everyone takes their places.)

1694
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:28,725
Keep your places.

1695
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:29,900
Go to your places.

1696
00:57:29,903 --> 00:57:33,025
(Ji Hyo goes to Cell 2. Jong Kook goes to Cell 1.)

1697
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:35,070
So that's what the numbers are.

1698
00:57:35,075 --> 00:57:37,810
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Haha take their proper cells.)

1699
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,870
The total age is 121 years, right?

1700
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:41,940
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok versus Kwang Soo, So Min, Se Chan)

1701
00:57:41,948 --> 00:57:44,545
(What will be the result?)

1702
00:58:05,972 --> 00:58:08,140
Everyone, go to your places.

1703
00:58:08,141 --> 00:58:09,870
(Everyone takes their places.)

1704
00:58:09,876 --> 00:58:11,665
Keep your places.

1705
00:58:11,778 --> 00:58:12,840
Go to your places.

1706
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:15,975
(Ji Hyo goes to Cell 2. Jong Kook goes to Cell 1.)

1707
00:58:16,082 --> 00:58:18,010
So that's what the numbers are.

1708
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:20,750
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Haha take their proper cells.)

1709
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:22,820
The total age is 121 years, right?

1710
00:58:22,822 --> 00:58:25,220
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok versus Kwang Soo, So Min, Se Chan)

1711
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:27,815
(What will be the result?)

1712
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:35,055
(Truth or Dare is a success.)

1713
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:36,700
(They're gold medalists at the moment.)

1714
00:58:36,703 --> 00:58:38,000
You're not good enough for us.

1715
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:39,865
All right!

1716
00:58:40,406 --> 00:58:42,440
- All right. - We did it.

1717
00:58:42,442 --> 00:58:45,505
- This feels great. - All right.

1718
00:58:45,512 --> 00:58:46,980
This feels nice.

1719
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,580
Our teamwork is amazing.

1720
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:52,310
We never fail things like this.

1721
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:55,750
I found out today. We're 321 years old altogether.

1722
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:58,490
- That's right. - I got goose bumps from something.

1723
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:01,885
- Our age... - You are 100 years old together.

1724
00:59:02,295 --> 00:59:03,690
(It's a century with these two together.)

1725
00:59:03,696 --> 00:59:05,560
- These two together. - That's what shocked me.

1726
00:59:05,565 --> 00:59:08,300
- Okay. - It's only true this year.

1727
00:59:08,301 --> 00:59:10,300
That's true.

1728
00:59:10,303 --> 00:59:12,700
(And a week later)

1729
00:59:12,705 --> 00:59:13,700
(Dangerous Choice follows Truth or Dare.)

1730
00:59:13,706 --> 00:59:16,765
- Hello. - Hello.

1731
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,970
Today, it'll be a couple race...

1732
00:59:19,979 --> 00:59:21,875
where eight teams will compete.

1733
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:24,750
(Actress Lee Elijah, Actress E Xi A)

1734
00:59:24,751 --> 00:59:27,180
(Actress Lee Ju Yeon, Singer Sun Mi, Comedian Kim Ji Min)

1735
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:30,150
(Bobby of iKON, Seung Ri of Big Bang, B.I of iKON)

1736
00:59:30,156 --> 00:59:32,690
(This is a couple race with the 8 hottest stars.)

1737
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:36,090
In a moment, Running Man members will look at the items...

1738
00:59:36,095 --> 00:59:38,890
and choose one that they like. You become a couple...

1739
00:59:38,898 --> 00:59:40,730
with the member who chooses the same item.

1740
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:44,100
All right. Please choose an item each...

1741
00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:46,495
and fill out the cards.

1742
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:49,100
(They think about the Running Man members they like and choose.)

1743
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:50,270
I...

1744
00:59:50,276 --> 00:59:51,935
(They think about the Running Man members they like and choose.)

1745
00:59:52,345 --> 00:59:57,205
(They also fill out the card that'll be placed next to the item.)

1746
00:59:57,817 --> 00:59:59,775
It's raining.

1747
01:00:00,019 --> 01:00:02,920
Today, it's a couple race where you'll be partnered up...

1748
01:00:02,922 --> 01:00:05,520
with the guests who are the hottest stars.

1749
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:08,620
You'll select your partners first.

1750
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:10,830
- Already? - The guests...

1751
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:13,390
have already chosen a couple item.

1752
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:14,700
They have?

1753
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:16,630
This is what we used to do during blind dates.

1754
01:00:16,636 --> 01:00:19,830
The couples will be decided according to what you pick.

1755
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,640
As you know, there are five women...

1756
01:00:22,642 --> 01:00:24,170
and three men here today.

1757
01:00:24,177 --> 01:00:26,940
If there are three men, there'll be a male couple.

1758
01:00:26,946 --> 01:00:29,280
- There are three men. - Not me. I pick Sun Mi.

1759
01:00:29,282 --> 01:00:32,010
- Sun Mi has been here before. - Yes, that's right.

1760
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:34,120
- She was here with Elijah. - Elijah.

1761
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,620
- Elijah was my partner. - That's right.

1762
01:00:36,623 --> 01:00:38,820
And Ju Yeon is a good friend of So Min.

1763
01:00:38,825 --> 01:00:40,590
- We're from the same school. - Really?

1764
01:00:40,593 --> 01:00:42,060
Class of 2005 at Dongduk Women's University.

1765
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:44,430
People say this.

1766
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:47,330
You hang out with people who have similar tendencies as you.

1767
01:00:47,333 --> 01:00:48,460
That's not true.

1768
01:00:48,468 --> 01:00:51,800
- I heard she's not ordinary either. - We're different.

1769
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:53,900
- Are they similar? - We...

1770
01:00:53,907 --> 01:00:56,910
We had drinks together a few times. She's not ordinary at all.

1771
01:00:56,910 --> 01:00:59,910
From what I hear, she's 1 of the top 5 psychos...

1772
01:00:59,913 --> 01:01:03,210
in the music industry.

1773
01:01:03,216 --> 01:01:04,480
That's true.

1774
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:06,010
- Right? - Yes.

1775
01:01:06,019 --> 01:01:07,650
- Is she the Five Psychos? - Yes, Five Psychos.

1776
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:09,720
- Five Psychos. She's a member. - Here.

1777
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:13,720
So Min is 1 of the top 5 psychos in the acting industry.

1778
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:16,290
- I can't imagine it. - I know. I can't tell.

1779
01:01:16,296 --> 01:01:19,090
In front of you are the cards that they wrote.

1780
01:01:19,098 --> 01:01:21,330
- They wrote us letters. - Letters.

1781
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:23,800
- There are letters. - This is a guy.

1782
01:01:23,803 --> 01:01:24,970
(They guess whose item each one is from the writing and the content.)

1783
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:27,170
This has to be Seung Ri 100 percent.

1784
01:01:27,173 --> 01:01:30,340
"I'm going to count to 3, and you can come get the bag. 1, 2, 3."

1785
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:32,835
("I'm going to count to 3, and you can come get the bag. 1, 2, 3.")

1786
01:01:33,112 --> 01:01:35,580
- It's obvious he's promoting. - This has to be Seung Ri.

1787
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:38,280
- The bag is Seung Ri's. - This is Ju Yeon.

1788
01:01:38,284 --> 01:01:40,210
- "I only drink dewdrops." - It's Ju Yeon.

1789
01:01:40,219 --> 01:01:42,120
"Let's drink together." This is 100 percent, right?

1790
01:01:42,121 --> 01:01:44,350
She's not ordinary. Her brain is not ordinary.

1791
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:46,720
- Check all of them. - Hey!

1792
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:49,290
- This is a guy. - This has to be Seung Ri.

1793
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:51,960
- "I'm going to count to three..." - We already mentioned it.

1794
01:01:51,965 --> 01:01:55,430
- I already said that. - When?

1795
01:01:55,435 --> 01:01:57,100
(I said that 2 minutes ago.)

1796
01:01:57,103 --> 01:01:59,330
- When? - I said that.

1797
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:01,570
- Why are you stealing it from me? - When did you say that?

1798
01:02:01,574 --> 01:02:03,370
- I said it earlier. - Why did you whisper?

1799
01:02:03,376 --> 01:02:05,070
I didn't. I said it loud and clear.

1800
01:02:05,078 --> 01:02:07,440
- He said it clearly. - When was it?

1801
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:10,410
- Earlier. - This is driving me nuts.

1802
01:02:10,416 --> 01:02:13,350
- Seok Jin. - I feel like a loner.

1803
01:02:13,353 --> 01:02:15,020
(He's very sad.)

1804
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:17,590
What do you mean? It's more like you are bullying us.

1805
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,020
Why did you whisper? You excluded me.

1806
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:21,620
- Everybody heard it. - He said it to everybody.

1807
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:23,990
- It's a one-way street. - I know.

1808
01:02:23,997 --> 01:02:25,990
How are you picking who's going first?

1809
01:02:25,999 --> 01:02:29,300
Let's play Race of Wits.

1810
01:02:29,302 --> 01:02:31,570
He won't skip games. He won't let it slide.

1811
01:02:31,571 --> 01:02:34,640
I'm going to get witty. We played this so many times.

1812
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,800
- Start. - One.

1813
01:02:36,809 --> 01:02:38,170
- 2. - 3.

1814
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:40,340
- Does the loser pick 1st? - 4.

1815
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:41,640
Yes, the loser picks first.

1816
01:02:41,647 --> 01:02:43,675
- 5. - 6.

1817
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:45,650
(Seok Jin stands alone.)

1818
01:02:45,651 --> 01:02:47,380
(The game is finished in a blind of an eye.)

1819
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:49,620
(Six...)

1820
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:51,190
Do you guys practice?

1821
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,990
Does he pick last?

1822
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:54,790
Seok Jin is going last.

1823
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:57,490
- For this round, we jump. - Do we jump?

1824
01:02:57,497 --> 01:02:59,330
Yes. Start.

1825
01:02:59,332 --> 01:03:00,330
- 1. - 2.

1826
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:01,400
- 3. - 4.

1827
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:03,125
- 5. - 6.

1828
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,725
- 5. - 6.

1829
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:07,570
(He was moving up and down, and he's in 7th place.)

1830
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:09,700
- This... - It's hard to jump.

1831
01:03:09,709 --> 01:03:11,070
Jumping is hard.

1832
01:03:11,077 --> 01:03:12,410
- Start. - One.

1833
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:13,710
- 2. - 3.

1834
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:16,110
- Okay. - Haha and Jae Seok.

1835
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:18,010
- Goodness. - Face up or down

1836
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:19,945
(The bottom half is decided. It's time for the top half.)

1837
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:22,080
Okay. You're gone.

1838
01:03:22,088 --> 01:03:24,320
- This time... - I'm nervous for some reason.

1839
01:03:24,323 --> 01:03:26,520
Slap each other and the person who doesn't laugh wins.

1840
01:03:26,526 --> 01:03:28,620
(This time)

1841
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:30,830
(Slapping)

1842
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,490
(All of a sudden?)

1843
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:34,200
- Hey. - Didn't we start?

1844
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,060
- We did. You're out. - Didn't we?

1845
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:37,470
- You're out. - Why?

1846
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,700
- You're out. You made a sound. - Why?

1847
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,470
You made a sound. You're out.

1848
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:44,570
- You're out. - I didn't make a sound.

1849
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:46,310
Do rock-paper-scissors.

1850
01:03:46,312 --> 01:03:47,640
(The person who gets to choose 1st is...)

1851
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:49,640
- Good. - So Min goes first.

1852
01:03:49,649 --> 01:03:52,750
- So Min has many options. - So Min.

1853
01:03:52,752 --> 01:03:55,650
I knew it. She's good with couple races.

1854
01:03:55,655 --> 01:03:57,520
- Right? - For some reason,

1855
01:03:57,523 --> 01:03:59,390
- I'm drawn to this heart. - Good.

1856
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:01,560
- Really? - It's Seung Ri.

1857
01:04:01,561 --> 01:04:03,520
- It might not be. - That's true.

1858
01:04:03,529 --> 01:04:05,730
- They might have switched them. - That's true.

1859
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,060
No, I don't think so. It can't be.

1860
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:10,060
- It might be fake. - It might be a trick.

1861
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:13,330
I like this one. This heart is the biggest.

1862
01:04:13,339 --> 01:04:16,095
(So Min chooses the heart bag.)

1863
01:04:16,442 --> 01:04:18,265
- Next is... - Me.

1864
01:04:18,277 --> 01:04:19,740
I think... This...

1865
01:04:19,745 --> 01:04:21,010
(He's drawn to this item.)

1866
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:22,310
- Are those socks? - Yes.

1867
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:24,010
It says, "Kwang Soo". This is either good or bad.

1868
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:26,580
- I don't want him to have this. - That's good.

1869
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:29,020
They were looking for Kwang Soo, and you took it.

1870
01:04:29,021 --> 01:04:30,650
That's good.

1871
01:04:30,656 --> 01:04:32,490
- You never know. - Good job, Se Chan.

1872
01:04:32,492 --> 01:04:33,990
- Okay. - Who's next?

1873
01:04:33,993 --> 01:04:36,490
- I think this letter... - The music one?

1874
01:04:36,496 --> 01:04:38,060
sounds the most sincere.

1875
01:04:38,064 --> 01:04:40,855
- But... - Kwang Soo likes music.

1876
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:44,795
I thought this looked like a guy's writing.

1877
01:04:44,804 --> 01:04:46,270
(Ji Hyo chooses the scarf.)

1878
01:04:46,272 --> 01:04:49,470
It says, "Haha", so I have to take it.

1879
01:04:49,475 --> 01:04:51,470
- Haha is mine... - Aren't you disgusted?

1880
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:52,540
on Running Man.

1881
01:04:52,545 --> 01:04:55,035
(The others have no chance.)

1882
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:56,940
- Haha. - And my wife...

1883
01:04:56,949 --> 01:04:58,545
understands too.

1884
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:00,450
I find that so interesting.

1885
01:05:00,453 --> 01:05:03,120
That's a relief.

1886
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:05,190
- Okay, this. - Okay.

1887
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,985
- What's that? - A fan.

1888
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,490
- Okay. - All right.

1889
01:05:08,494 --> 01:05:11,325
- This one is for you. - Okay.

1890
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:14,700
(They all choose their items.)

1891
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,430
We'll first invite...

1892
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:19,730
- the guest... - Me.

1893
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:22,640
- who chose the headphones. - I'm curious.

1894
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:25,340
- He looks excited. - I'm curious too.

1895
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:26,340
- Who will it be? - He's into this.

1896
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:28,710
It's hard to be excited every time to be honest.

1897
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:30,605
It's coming up. They pressed the button.

1898
01:05:30,917 --> 01:05:32,080
Please. They're coming.

1899
01:05:32,084 --> 01:05:33,920
(This person makes Kwang Soo's facial muscles twitch.)

1900
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:38,020
(This person probably gets emotional when they listen to music.)

1901
01:05:38,024 --> 01:05:41,620
(They are coming now.)

1902
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:42,790
- It's a woman. - It is.

1903
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:44,430
Who is it?

1904
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,790
- Is it Sun Mi? - She's pretty.

1905
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:47,800
- She's hiding. - Is it Sun Mi?

1906
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,000
(Who is the partner with the headphones?)

1907
01:05:52,004 --> 01:05:53,600
I think it's Lee Elijah.

1908
01:05:53,606 --> 01:05:56,065
- It's Elijah. - Elijah.

1909
01:05:56,075 --> 01:05:58,365
It's Elijah.

1910
01:05:58,411 --> 01:06:00,165
Elijah.

1911
01:06:00,746 --> 01:06:02,580
(Let's talk about Elijah.)

1912
01:06:02,582 --> 01:06:05,280
(She's a great actress, looks beautiful, and is funny.)

1913
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:09,220
(She'll dominate Running Man again with her talents.)

1914
01:06:09,222 --> 01:06:10,920
Are we a couple? Yes.

1915
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,390
- Elijah. - Hello.

1916
01:06:12,391 --> 01:06:15,260
I'm sorry, but what was this?

1917
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:16,790
(You know what it is.)

1918
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:18,685
She's so weird from the beginning.

1919
01:06:19,198 --> 01:06:21,200
- You don't look that happy. - No, I am.

1920
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,000
- Are you in the same agency? - We are.

1921
01:06:24,003 --> 01:06:26,165
- Yes. - You work in the same company.

1922
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:29,170
They became partners,

1923
01:06:29,175 --> 01:06:31,210
and they're both not that happy.

1924
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:33,840
She didn't say anything to me yet.

1925
01:06:33,846 --> 01:06:35,040
(This is what happens when you are partnered with your family.)

1926
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:37,180
- Did you see Kwang Soo? - He might be shy.

1927
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,410
This is funny.

1928
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:39,580
- Yes! - Yes!

1929
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:41,075
(Let's try our best.)

1930
01:06:41,254 --> 01:06:44,550
All right. It's so awkward between you two.

1931
01:06:44,557 --> 01:06:46,690
- What's wrong? - This is suffocating.

1932
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:47,820
(Following the suffocating couple...)

1933
01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:51,015
Next is the couple cushion.

1934
01:06:51,063 --> 01:06:53,185
- Okay. - The couple cushion.

1935
01:06:53,733 --> 01:06:55,425
Do you think...

1936
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:57,100
- this is a guy? - It's a guy.

1937
01:06:57,103 --> 01:07:00,370
It's a guy. The excessive ones are all guys.

1938
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:01,840
Who stamps the paper with their lips?

1939
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:03,970
This person doesn't know moderation.

1940
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:06,640
They either have too much experience on variety shows...

1941
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:08,205
They're here.

1942
01:07:08,514 --> 01:07:10,010
- They're here. - They're here.

1943
01:07:10,016 --> 01:07:11,605
(The person is here.)

1944
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:13,180
- It's a woman. - It is.

1945
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:14,420
It's a woman.

1946
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:15,520
(Jae Seok's cushion partner is...)

1947
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:17,290
Xi A. It's Xi A.

1948
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,350
It's E Xi A.

1949
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:19,985
(E Xi A is a new, popular actress.)

1950
01:07:20,893 --> 01:07:24,390
(She steals the men's hearts and catches attention with her acting.)

1951
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:27,360
(She's the scene-stealer who gets everybody's attention.)

1952
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:28,830
I said this earlier.

1953
01:07:28,834 --> 01:07:31,070
She either has too much experience on variety shows...

1954
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:32,830
- or not at all. - Right.

1955
01:07:32,838 --> 01:07:35,600
This is "Match Made from Above" style.

1956
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:37,595
I watched it a lot.

1957
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:40,410
You can watch her later.

1958
01:07:40,413 --> 01:07:42,410
- What? - She's a former girl group member.

1959
01:07:42,415 --> 01:07:43,910
- Really? - You didn't know, right?

1960
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:45,650
- She's from a girl group? - Which one?

1961
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:47,275
Really?

1962
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,420
- She's incredible. - Really?

1963
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:50,420
(She has unexpected charms. How will she do today?)

1964
01:07:50,423 --> 01:07:52,950
Next is the headband.

1965
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:54,460
- The headband? - It's Jong Kook.

1966
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,360
- Come here. - What? Me? Okay.

1967
01:07:56,362 --> 01:07:59,390
In amusement parks, there are people...

1968
01:07:59,398 --> 01:08:02,160
- who only work in the summer. - During the busy seasons?

1969
01:08:02,168 --> 01:08:04,500
Yes. This is where I put my money.

1970
01:08:04,503 --> 01:08:06,600
This is where you collect money.

1971
01:08:06,605 --> 01:08:07,900
You're the boss.

1972
01:08:07,907 --> 01:08:09,140
- They're coming up. - They're here.

1973
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:10,270
Who is it?

1974
01:08:10,276 --> 01:08:11,510
- I think it's Sun Mi. - Is it a guy or a girl?

1975
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,940
It's Ji Min.

1976
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:14,240
- What? - It's a woman.

1977
01:08:14,246 --> 01:08:16,635
It's a woman.

1978
01:08:16,882 --> 01:08:21,850
(The Heart Man's partner is...)

1979
01:08:21,854 --> 01:08:23,080
It's Ju Yeon.

1980
01:08:23,089 --> 01:08:24,615
(Lee Ju Yeon is the original beauty face and a great entertainer.)

1981
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:28,120
(She started off as After School and is now an actress.)

1982
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:31,730
(She can dance, sing, and act. She transforms all the time.)

1983
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:34,100
(1 of the top 5 psychos is here.)

1984
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:36,895
She's here! Jong Kook, she's here!

1985
01:08:37,603 --> 01:08:39,165
Jong Kook...

1986
01:08:41,273 --> 01:08:43,235
(She twists her ankle.)

1987
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:48,035
(It looks like she's full of pride, but she flounders.)

1988
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:51,210
Look! Look at her. Look at her strut.

1989
01:08:51,217 --> 01:08:52,250
She's unique.

1990
01:08:52,251 --> 01:08:54,010
- She's 1 of the top 5 psychos. - Top 5 psychos.

1991
01:08:54,019 --> 01:08:56,050
Goodness. Jong Kook.

1992
01:08:56,055 --> 01:08:58,250
(Why is he embarrassed for her?)

1993
01:08:58,257 --> 01:09:00,220
- She's 1 of the top 5. - Top 5 psychos.

1994
01:09:00,226 --> 01:09:01,690
- She's one of them. - Where do I stand?

1995
01:09:01,694 --> 01:09:02,760
Here.

1996
01:09:02,762 --> 01:09:03,990
(I'm partners with Jong Kook.)

1997
01:09:03,996 --> 01:09:05,590
- Gosh. - Lucky you.

1998
01:09:05,598 --> 01:09:06,990
She's indeed in the top five.

1999
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:09,195
We're from the same school. Hey.

2000
01:09:09,702 --> 01:09:12,130
- Did you take the sock? - There's only Sun Mi left.

2001
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:13,270
- What? - The sock?

2002
01:09:13,272 --> 01:09:15,000
I was going to pick the sock.

2003
01:09:15,007 --> 01:09:16,570
Really? Why didn't you?

2004
01:09:16,575 --> 01:09:19,605
I thought it'd be him.

2005
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:21,840
I'm happy I don't have you either.

2006
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:22,880
Okay.

2007
01:09:22,882 --> 01:09:25,180
What's going on? There's something going on between you two.

2008
01:09:25,184 --> 01:09:26,710
With her? No, not at all.

2009
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:28,780
- We're close. We're friends. - We're friends.

2010
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:31,020
- Not at all. - She got his name wrong.

2011
01:09:31,023 --> 01:09:32,945
She called him "Chan Young".

2012
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:34,620
(Why is he Chan Young?)

2013
01:09:34,627 --> 01:09:36,090
What? Why?

2014
01:09:36,095 --> 01:09:37,930
I don't know. She says I'm Jung Chan Young.

2015
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:40,490
They met and drank all day. When they were going home,

2016
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:41,760
she said, "It was nice meeting you, Chan Young."

2017
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,700
(That's what happened.)

2018
01:09:44,703 --> 01:09:46,700
- What are you doing? - I was so mad.

2019
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:48,470
I was angry. She didn't even get my last name right.

2020
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:49,570
Who's Jung Chan Young?

2021
01:09:49,575 --> 01:09:50,910
Who did you get him confused with?

2022
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:53,570
He's the husband of an After School member.

2023
01:09:53,579 --> 01:09:55,610
- Then why... - I have no idea.

2024
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:57,175
That's so scary.

2025
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:59,010
- She's a psycho, right? - She's no joke.

2026
01:09:59,018 --> 01:10:00,610
There's no basis for her to say that.

2027
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,445
She might be in the top three.

2028
01:10:02,788 --> 01:10:04,720
(She proves her class as 1 of the top 5 psychos.)

2029
01:10:04,723 --> 01:10:07,120
- Next is the bag. - They're the same.

2030
01:10:07,126 --> 01:10:08,360
The bag?

2031
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,030
I'm getting anxious. Whose is this?

2032
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,060
They're here.

2033
01:10:12,064 --> 01:10:13,190
(It looks like a man's silhouette.)

2034
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:14,230
We're right.

2035
01:10:14,233 --> 01:10:16,700
It's a man, So Min. It's B.I.

2036
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:19,570
(Is it Seung Ri like the card hinted or is it someone else?)

2037
01:10:19,572 --> 01:10:22,270
(Who is the one behind the heart?)

2038
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,410
(It's The Great Seung Ri.)

2039
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:27,540
(He went from Big Bang's youngest member to a person of influence.)

2040
01:10:27,546 --> 01:10:30,580
(He's CEO Lee who owns global businesses.)

2041
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:34,010
(He writes history every day.)

2042
01:10:34,019 --> 01:10:36,115
It's obviously Seung Ri.

2043
01:10:36,455 --> 01:10:38,790
(This is suffocating to watch.)

2044
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:40,350
Look at his dress shoes.

2045
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:41,720
It's obviously him.

2046
01:10:41,727 --> 01:10:43,785
Why did he turn so unctuous?

2047
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:46,060
(He starts promoting his song out of nowhere.)

2048
01:10:46,065 --> 01:10:48,430
(He's on fire as soon as he comes out.)

2049
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:49,600
What's this?

2050
01:10:49,602 --> 01:10:51,430
- This is old style. - Is it not like this anymore?

2051
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:53,370
- No, it's changed. - Over there.

2052
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:55,265
- That's your partner. - Here's your partner.

2053
01:10:56,075 --> 01:10:57,710
- Hello. - Hello.

2054
01:10:57,710 --> 01:10:59,405
Nice to...

2055
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:02,240
Who is this cute lady?

2056
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:05,375
(He does a skit all of a sudden.)

2057
01:11:05,718 --> 01:11:07,380
(Who is this guy?)

2058
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:08,650
Are you a gangster or something?

2059
01:11:08,654 --> 01:11:11,050
- Is he a gangster or something? - What's this?

2060
01:11:11,056 --> 01:11:12,990
Why is he doing that?

2061
01:11:12,992 --> 01:11:14,490
- What's that? - No...

2062
01:11:14,493 --> 01:11:15,720
No, today...

2063
01:11:15,728 --> 01:11:19,460
- Why are you talking like a thug? - I'm dressed for the role.

2064
01:11:19,465 --> 01:11:21,160
- Turn it into romance. - Didn't I get it right?

2065
01:11:21,166 --> 01:11:22,760
- No. - It's romance.

2066
01:11:22,768 --> 01:11:24,800
This is good.

2067
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:27,540
From what I hear,

2068
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,140
Seung Ri is the only member who's active, right?

2069
01:11:31,143 --> 01:11:32,710
- This is your prime. - That's right.

2070
01:11:32,711 --> 01:11:34,810
- This is the happiest time. - That's right.

2071
01:11:34,813 --> 01:11:37,710
People who didn't know me know me now.

2072
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:39,445
It took 13 years.

2073
01:11:39,585 --> 01:11:41,580
It took 13 years.

2074
01:11:41,587 --> 01:11:44,920
This is his prime since he started as Big Bang.

2075
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:46,650
- That's right. - That's great.

2076
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:49,520
You two look so good together.

2077
01:11:49,528 --> 01:11:50,860
(We expect great chemistry between them.)

2078
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:51,890
Who's next?

2079
01:11:51,897 --> 01:11:53,160
Next is the sock.

2080
01:11:53,165 --> 01:11:54,830
- Me? Wait. - The sock.

2081
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:57,295
There are three people left, right? Ji Min...

2082
01:11:57,336 --> 01:12:00,795
- Four people. - They're running out of options.

2083
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,500
- They're coming. - Who is it?

2084
01:12:02,508 --> 01:12:04,310
(There are 2 female and 2 male guests left.)

2085
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:05,470
They're here.

2086
01:12:05,477 --> 01:12:07,710
(There's a 50-percent chance he'll be partnered with a female.)

2087
01:12:07,713 --> 01:12:08,880
Please let it be a guy.

2088
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:11,450
(Who chose the sock and will be partners with Se Chan?)

2089
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:15,345
(It's B.I of iKON, who is popular among children.)

2090
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:18,620
(He plays the leading role in "Love Scenario".)

2091
01:12:18,624 --> 01:12:21,720
(He's the irreplaceable leader of iKON.)

2092
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:23,360
(I'm here, girls.)

2093
01:12:23,362 --> 01:12:26,360
B.I and Se Chan are...

2094
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:28,060
- are kind of awkward. - Right.

2095
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,500
- It's awkward. They're awkward. - B.I looks so handsome.

2096
01:12:30,502 --> 01:12:32,230
I'm a big fan of his.

2097
01:12:32,237 --> 01:12:33,600
- Really? - Yes.

2098
01:12:33,606 --> 01:12:34,970
Thank you. Let's have fun today.

2099
01:12:34,974 --> 01:12:36,740
- I'm a big fan of yours too. - And...

2100
01:12:36,742 --> 01:12:38,170
he has a stage name.

2101
01:12:38,177 --> 01:12:39,865
He's Jung Chan Young.

2102
01:12:40,779 --> 01:12:42,880
(He's not Yang Se Chan.)

2103
01:12:42,881 --> 01:12:44,140
Am I Jung Chan Young?

2104
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:45,750
What did you do to me?

2105
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:47,550
(Sorry, Chan Young. I mean, Se Chan.)

2106
01:12:47,553 --> 01:12:50,280
Next is the bracelet.

2107
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:51,450
Okay!

2108
01:12:51,457 --> 01:12:52,720
They're coming up.

2109
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:54,320
- Is it a woman? - Wait. I'm not sure.

2110
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:55,490
Okay!

2111
01:12:55,494 --> 01:12:57,090
It's Sun Mi. It's Sun Mi, Seok Jin.

2112
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:58,460
(You can slightly see her silhouette.)

2113
01:12:58,464 --> 01:13:00,755
I avoided a man.

2114
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:05,800
(It's not a man. She's small.)

2115
01:13:05,804 --> 01:13:07,670
It's Ji Min.

2116
01:13:07,673 --> 01:13:09,335
(Kim Ji Min is a beautiful comedian.)

2117
01:13:09,975 --> 01:13:11,910
(Sighing)

2118
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,370
Go get your father.

2119
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:14,940
Get your father.

2120
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:16,580
Bow to him, Ji Min.

2121
01:13:16,582 --> 01:13:17,810
(She's so polite.)

2122
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:20,350
- She's polite. - Who is it? Is it you?

2123
01:13:20,352 --> 01:13:22,480
- It's me. - Why?

2124
01:13:22,488 --> 01:13:23,650
I'm still happy.

2125
01:13:23,656 --> 01:13:25,350
(It's strictly a senior-junior relationship.)

2126
01:13:25,357 --> 01:13:26,720
How did this happen?

2127
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:28,260
Let's go, Sun Mi.

2128
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,660
Let's go, Bobby.

2129
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:31,160
They're here.

2130
01:13:31,163 --> 01:13:32,760
- It's Sun Mi. - Who is it?

2131
01:13:32,765 --> 01:13:34,090
It's Sun Mi and Bobby.

2132
01:13:34,099 --> 01:13:35,460
We don't know who their partners are.

2133
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:37,060
They're both coming up. It depends on where they go.

2134
01:13:37,069 --> 01:13:38,630
(Would it be male-male and female-female couples?)

2135
01:13:38,637 --> 01:13:39,900
- Come out. - Sun Mi and Bobby.

2136
01:13:39,905 --> 01:13:42,070
(Or would it be male-female couples?)

2137
01:13:42,074 --> 01:13:46,040
(What will the last result be?)

2138
01:13:46,045 --> 01:13:47,780
- They're so... - He's wearing a scarf.

2139
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,910
(Bobby is Ji Hyo's partner, and Sun Mi is Haha's partner.)

2140
01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:50,775
It's Bobby and Ji Hyo.

2141
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:54,080
(He smiles with his eyes, but he has a manly side.)

2142
01:13:54,086 --> 01:13:57,520
(He's the hip hop champion who stole the ladies' hearts.)

2143
01:13:57,523 --> 01:13:59,990
(24 hours is not enough for this charming woman.)

2144
01:13:59,992 --> 01:14:03,920
(She flipped Korea upside down with her unrivaled performance.)

2145
01:14:03,929 --> 01:14:06,225
- Hello. - They look good together.

2146
01:14:06,298 --> 01:14:09,300
- They look good together. - Those two look good together.

2147
01:14:09,301 --> 01:14:10,630
That's true.

2148
01:14:10,636 --> 01:14:12,770
What if these 2 and those 2 are couples?

2149
01:14:12,771 --> 01:14:14,500
- They look good together. - Let's do that.

2150
01:14:14,506 --> 01:14:16,295
They look good together.

2151
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:19,870
(The couple selection is over with Haha and Sun Mi, Ji Hyo and Bobby.)

2152
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:24,380
(Couples)

2153
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,950
We have incredible people here today.

2154
01:14:25,951 --> 01:14:27,545
Please give them a round of applause.

2155
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:29,520
I'm so excited.

2156
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,850
They're incredible.

2157
01:14:31,857 --> 01:14:33,585
This is great.

2158
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:36,660
Let's talk to Sun Mi first.

2159
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:37,890
She's awesome.

2160
01:14:37,896 --> 01:14:40,860
How have you been?

2161
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:42,600
- I've been well. - She swept all the festivals.

2162
01:14:42,601 --> 01:14:44,360
That's what I was about to say.

2163
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:48,940
There are performances that dominated the college festivals.

2164
01:14:48,941 --> 01:14:50,500
People go insane.

2165
01:14:50,509 --> 01:14:51,910
The video went viral too.

2166
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:55,110
There was a festival where all the sexy ladies were invited to.

2167
01:14:55,114 --> 01:14:56,740
She came out and swept it all.

2168
01:14:56,749 --> 01:14:58,480
- No way. - I'm serious.

2169
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,950
- No. - I'm serious.

2170
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:03,515
Sun Mi, can you show us the performance?

2171
01:15:03,889 --> 01:15:05,490
But the thing is,

2172
01:15:05,491 --> 01:15:09,060
it went popular because I was soaked.

2173
01:15:09,061 --> 01:15:10,990
We can't pour water on you.

2174
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:13,260
Is this water for me by any chance?

2175
01:15:13,265 --> 01:15:14,925
(We can't pour water on her.)

2176
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:17,200
Sun Mi.

2177
01:15:17,202 --> 01:15:21,295
Do you think we got this to see your performance?

2178
01:15:21,306 --> 01:15:23,900
(It's obviously drinking water.)

2179
01:15:23,909 --> 01:15:25,170
That's not right.

2180
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:26,840
(She's not ordinary.)

2181
01:15:26,845 --> 01:15:28,380
That's not right.

2182
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,980
(She's just as bad as me.)

2183
01:15:29,982 --> 01:15:31,705
Show us how it's like.

2184
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,180
There were muscular men standing behind her.

2185
01:15:34,186 --> 01:15:35,620
Can you stand behind her?

2186
01:15:35,621 --> 01:15:37,320
Who? Me?

2187
01:15:37,322 --> 01:15:38,920
No, it's okay.

2188
01:15:38,924 --> 01:15:40,420
Kwang Soo, stand behind her.

2189
01:15:40,425 --> 01:15:42,960
- Should I stand behind... - Should we stand behind her?

2190
01:15:42,961 --> 01:15:44,930
- We'll stand behind her. - Do we just stand?

2191
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,430
It looks awful with the two of them standing there.

2192
01:15:47,432 --> 01:15:48,460
(That's true.)

2193
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:52,225
(It's better not to have them there.)

2194
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:57,000
(She pulls herself together and starts dancing to "Gashina".)

2195
01:15:57,009 --> 01:15:58,835
(Grabbing)

2196
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:02,240
(What was that for?)

2197
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:04,780
(His heart drops.)

2198
01:16:04,783 --> 01:16:06,845
(Mom...)

2199
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:09,850
(It goes wrong from the start.)

2200
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,090
(His heart is about to drop from the slightest contact.)

2201
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,350
It's part of the choreography.

2202
01:16:13,358 --> 01:16:15,220
- Do we do it together? How? - Yes.

2203
01:16:15,227 --> 01:16:16,260
You have to hug her.

2204
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:18,355
You have to hug her from the back. That's right.

2205
01:16:20,132 --> 01:16:21,800
(Let me borrow your body.)

2206
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,530
(Turning)

2207
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:25,065
That's right.

2208
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,700
(What's this?)

2209
01:16:27,706 --> 01:16:29,270
You should have told us first.

2210
01:16:29,274 --> 01:16:30,340
She did it by herself.

2211
01:16:30,342 --> 01:16:32,910
The guys turn around.

2212
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:35,080
(The song is reaching its climax.)

2213
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,610
(Swirling)

2214
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,675
- This is next. - "No".

2215
01:16:40,352 --> 01:16:42,015
Do it now.

2216
01:16:43,188 --> 01:16:44,250
(Why are you leaving the pretty me here?)

2217
01:16:44,256 --> 01:16:45,620
- Do I shoot? - Shoot.

2218
01:16:45,624 --> 01:16:46,720
(Shoot now.)

2219
01:16:46,725 --> 01:16:50,015
(They all shoot.)

2220
01:16:50,295 --> 01:16:52,985
(They dominate the stage.)

2221
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:54,730
- Great job. - Shoot your guns.

2222
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:56,455
- Good. - Good job.

2223
01:16:56,568 --> 01:16:58,525
(He approves as well.)

2224
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:01,640
(He was going down nicely...)

2225
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,870
(How far are you going?)

2226
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:04,435
Good job.

2227
01:17:05,277 --> 01:17:06,410
Hey.

2228
01:17:06,411 --> 01:17:07,770
(This is an old, comedic dance.)

2229
01:17:07,779 --> 01:17:08,810
(Dancer Kwang Soo's solo time)

2230
01:17:08,814 --> 01:17:10,010
What?

2231
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,080
(She's shocked.)

2232
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:13,280
- That's not it. - That's not it.

2233
01:17:13,285 --> 01:17:14,880
Hey, what's this?

2234
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:16,850
- It's part of the performance. - Oh, gosh.

2235
01:17:16,855 --> 01:17:18,950
What's this?

2236
01:17:18,957 --> 01:17:21,090
There's the choreography that comes before this.

2237
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:23,290
- That was awesome. - That was.

2238
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:25,590
- She's different. - She's good.

2239
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:27,560
They're all great dancers.

2240
01:17:27,566 --> 01:17:29,500
I don't have to mention Ju Yeon.

2241
01:17:29,501 --> 01:17:30,730
- Ji Min is good too. - She is.

2242
01:17:30,736 --> 01:17:31,730
- I guess. - She's good.

2243
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:33,265
Xi A is good too.

2244
01:17:33,572 --> 01:17:36,040
- Elijah is good too. - Elijah...

2245
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,670
I've seen her do the traditional mask dance.

2246
01:17:37,676 --> 01:17:39,140
It's ballet.

2247
01:17:39,144 --> 01:17:41,480
(She did the traditional mask dance.)

2248
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,840
- Ballet? - Oh, it was ballet.

2249
01:17:42,848 --> 01:17:43,840
Oh, right.

2250
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:45,710
- She does ballet. - What?

2251
01:17:45,717 --> 01:17:48,775
She does ballet. That's right.

2252
01:17:49,021 --> 01:17:50,820
Does anybody want to challenge that?

2253
01:17:50,822 --> 01:17:53,315
Do you want us to do "Gashina"?

2254
01:17:53,392 --> 01:17:54,620
- "Gashina"? - Sure, go ahead.

2255
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:55,620
You know "Gashina", right?

2256
01:17:55,627 --> 01:17:57,820
- I don't really know it. - You don't?

2257
01:17:57,829 --> 01:17:59,860
- Do it while you have a chance. - Sorry? Hold on.

2258
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:02,000
(A chance?)

2259
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,200
Hurry up.

2260
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:04,970
- You will lose your chance. - What are you saying?

2261
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,570
Why do you say such mean things?

2262
01:18:06,571 --> 01:18:08,700
Since this is her first time on Running Man...

2263
01:18:08,707 --> 01:18:11,370
He is picking on the guest. Isn't he picking on the guest?

2264
01:18:11,376 --> 01:18:13,510
- Who are you to give her a chance? - Isn't he picking on the guest?

2265
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:14,570
- Who are you to give her a chance? - It's not like that.

2266
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:15,840
A chance like this...

2267
01:18:15,847 --> 01:18:17,680
- Does the dance go like this? - Who are you to give her a chance?

2268
01:18:17,683 --> 01:18:19,110
If she refuses to do it, she won't get screen time.

2269
01:18:19,117 --> 01:18:21,350
I just feel bad. I just feel bad.

2270
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:23,680
SBS is giving you a lot of chances.

2271
01:18:23,689 --> 01:18:24,920
I hope I succeed.

2272
01:18:24,923 --> 01:18:26,990
(Speak for yourself.)

2273
01:18:26,992 --> 01:18:28,460
- I hope I succeed. - You need to do well.

2274
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,990
(The world of variety shows is a scary place.)

2275
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:32,430
- I need to do well. - You need to do well.

2276
01:18:32,431 --> 01:18:33,660
I received another chance today.

2277
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:34,900
That's right. You need to do well.

2278
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,930
Seriously.

2279
01:18:35,934 --> 01:18:38,870
Ju Yeon was incredible in her heyday.

2280
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,500
- She is incredible. - That's right.

2281
01:18:40,505 --> 01:18:42,370
She is still incredible.

2282
01:18:42,374 --> 01:18:44,710
She was in After School.

2283
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,070
- That's right. - There was this dance move.

2284
01:18:46,078 --> 01:18:47,340
- What is that? - After School's dance move.

2285
01:18:47,346 --> 01:18:48,780
- There is no such dance move. - No?

2286
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,340
- There is no such dance move. - That's Psy's dance move.

2287
01:18:50,349 --> 01:18:51,380
What is that?

2288
01:18:51,383 --> 01:18:53,010
There is that dance move.

2289
01:18:53,018 --> 01:18:55,280
I knew it. There is that dance move.

2290
01:18:55,287 --> 01:18:56,580
There is that dance move.

2291
01:18:56,588 --> 01:18:58,685
(She puts her hand on Jong Kook's shoulder.)

2292
01:18:59,257 --> 01:19:00,450
- After School. - You know,

2293
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:02,160
this kind of behavior amazes me.

2294
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,320
- She didn't even ask. - Although she met Jong Kook today,

2295
01:19:03,328 --> 01:19:05,990
she put her hand on his shoulder like this.

2296
01:19:05,998 --> 01:19:07,790
- She didn't even ask. - She is the best.

2297
01:19:07,799 --> 01:19:08,830
(She is 1 of the top 5 psycho.)

2298
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:09,860
She is the best.

2299
01:19:09,868 --> 01:19:11,830
She isn't aware of her surroundings.

2300
01:19:11,837 --> 01:19:13,430
I told you she is 1 of the top 5 psycho.

2301
01:19:13,438 --> 01:19:15,340
She is one of them.

2302
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:17,440
I can't balance myself.

2303
01:19:17,442 --> 01:19:18,610
You did a good job.

2304
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,405
His muscles are really firm.

2305
01:19:21,046 --> 01:19:23,210
(She is childlike.)

2306
01:19:23,215 --> 01:19:25,480
(She isn't aware of what she has done,)

2307
01:19:25,484 --> 01:19:26,480
(but everyone else is incredulous.)

2308
01:19:26,485 --> 01:19:29,780
That's good. That's good. Jong Kook is flustered.

2309
01:19:29,788 --> 01:19:31,020
Jong Kook is flustered.

2310
01:19:31,023 --> 01:19:32,920
(It looks like Jong Kook met his match today.)

2311
01:19:32,924 --> 01:19:36,160
Do Sun Mi's signature dance move of turning around...

2312
01:19:36,161 --> 01:19:37,520
in turns.

2313
01:19:37,529 --> 01:19:40,390
- Would you do that? - I can't wait to see it.

2314
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:42,260
- Shall B.I go first? - B.I.

2315
01:19:42,267 --> 01:19:43,730
You can do this, B.I.

2316
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:45,970
- What am I doing? - Touch your hair.

2317
01:19:45,971 --> 01:19:47,130
Let's see.

2318
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:48,370
- Am I dancing by myself? - That's right.

2319
01:19:48,373 --> 01:19:49,900
- I see. - You are dancing by yourself.

2320
01:19:49,908 --> 01:19:50,900
Go ahead.

2321
01:19:50,909 --> 01:19:52,040
Show us your version.

2322
01:19:52,044 --> 01:19:53,210
(He gathers his energy.)

2323
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:55,875
(He turns around innocently.)

2324
01:19:56,248 --> 01:19:58,745
(Did you call for me?)

2325
01:19:59,684 --> 01:20:00,950
(The original singer gets knocked out.)

2326
01:20:00,952 --> 01:20:02,480
That was good.

2327
01:20:02,487 --> 01:20:05,385
Sun Mi is so happy.

2328
01:20:05,424 --> 01:20:08,020
Seriously. It wasn't that funny.

2329
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:09,320
(He shoots shyly.)

2330
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:11,485
Shake your hips more, B.I. There you go.

2331
01:20:11,963 --> 01:20:13,530
There you go.

2332
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:14,590
(He becomes absorbed in the dance.)

2333
01:20:14,599 --> 01:20:16,300
(I can dance to "Gashina".)

2334
01:20:16,301 --> 01:20:18,070
Look at the way he shakes his hips.

2335
01:20:18,070 --> 01:20:19,070
That was cute.

2336
01:20:19,071 --> 01:20:20,100
(B.I's languid movements are impressive.)

2337
01:20:20,105 --> 01:20:22,265
That was amazing. You moved like this.

2338
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:25,310
All right. Ji Min, you are up next.

2339
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:26,570
Me?

2340
01:20:26,578 --> 01:20:28,480
I really can't dance.

2341
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:32,345
(Let's see how Ji Min does in her uncertainty.)

2342
01:20:33,118 --> 01:20:34,410
There you go.

2343
01:20:34,419 --> 01:20:35,620
That's good.

2344
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,780
(She captivates the audience with her disheveled hair.)

2345
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:40,245
(I am the queen of disheveled hair.)

2346
01:20:40,826 --> 01:20:44,690
(It looks amazing.)

2347
01:20:44,696 --> 01:20:46,660
(After doing the turn,)

2348
01:20:46,665 --> 01:20:49,360
(she twists her neck.)

2349
01:20:49,367 --> 01:20:51,260
(She can't be controlled.)

2350
01:20:51,269 --> 01:20:53,630
Stop it.

2351
01:20:53,638 --> 01:20:54,840
Turn off the music.

2352
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,100
(That's new.)

2353
01:20:57,109 --> 01:20:58,840
Pass. Pass.

2354
01:20:58,844 --> 01:20:59,910
(We applaud her explosive energy.)

2355
01:20:59,911 --> 01:21:02,275
Ji Min, that was...

2356
01:21:02,447 --> 01:21:05,450
When you twisted your neck, you lost your balance.

2357
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,780
- No, I didn't. - No?

2358
01:21:06,785 --> 01:21:08,010
It was intentional.

2359
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:09,615
She is good.

2360
01:21:10,255 --> 01:21:11,990
Up next is Chi Chi.

2361
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,220
A girl group, Chi Chi.

2362
01:21:13,225 --> 01:21:14,550
You can do this.

2363
01:21:14,559 --> 01:21:16,360
- What should I do? - Xi A.

2364
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:19,930
You had that role of Lee Byung Hun's mother.

2365
01:21:19,931 --> 01:21:21,755
Please forget about that.

2366
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:24,200
(What should I do?)

2367
01:21:24,202 --> 01:21:26,100
I will be at the yard.

2368
01:21:26,104 --> 01:21:28,570
(She is the most loving mother in "Mister Sunshine".)

2369
01:21:28,573 --> 01:21:29,570
Xi A.

2370
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:33,340
(She takes the stage.)

2371
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:37,410
(It's time to see the shy mother's dance skills.)

2372
01:21:37,415 --> 01:21:40,675
- Turn around. - Turn around.

2373
01:21:40,819 --> 01:21:44,750
(She is graceful and ladylike.)

2374
01:21:44,756 --> 01:21:46,985
(She transforms.)

2375
01:21:47,626 --> 01:21:50,560
(She twists her waist and blows a kiss.)

2376
01:21:50,562 --> 01:21:53,955
(A mother's splendid transformation)

2377
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:56,225
She is good.

2378
01:21:56,968 --> 01:21:58,200
(Swaying)

2379
01:21:58,203 --> 01:22:00,670
(She even shakes her hips seductively.)

2380
01:22:00,672 --> 01:22:02,070
(Excuse me, ma'am.)

2381
01:22:02,073 --> 01:22:03,070
Excuse me.

2382
01:22:03,074 --> 01:22:05,865
(She can't be controlled once she lets herself go.)

2383
01:22:06,278 --> 01:22:07,310
(Is she the person who was hesitant before?)

2384
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:08,380
Xi A.

2385
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:09,580
Did I go too far?

2386
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:11,080
You should have stopped after the turn.

2387
01:22:11,082 --> 01:22:12,380
Why did you shake your hips?

2388
01:22:12,384 --> 01:22:14,510
It was painful to watch.

2389
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:17,475
When was Chi Chi active?

2390
01:22:17,989 --> 01:22:19,550
Go back to your place.

2391
01:22:19,558 --> 01:22:21,560
For goodness' sake.

2392
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:23,090
Up next is Seung Ri.

2393
01:22:23,094 --> 01:22:24,290
I can't wait to see his version.

2394
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:25,630
Here comes the CEO.

2395
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,690
I can't wait to see his version.

2396
01:22:26,698 --> 01:22:30,030
After more than 10 years, he became the center of Big Bang.

2397
01:22:30,035 --> 01:22:31,570
- That's right. - He is standing tall.

2398
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,430
- He is receiving everyone's love. - That's right.

2399
01:22:33,438 --> 01:22:36,635
(It's time to see Seung Ri's version of "Gashina".)

2400
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:40,165
(Turning)

2401
01:22:41,079 --> 01:22:43,640
(What is this?)

2402
01:22:43,648 --> 01:22:46,750
(After turning around in a cool way,)

2403
01:22:46,751 --> 01:22:49,780
(he shoots everywhere.)

2404
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:52,120
(You are watching "Gashina" by Seung Ri,)

2405
01:22:52,123 --> 01:22:53,690
He is good.

2406
01:22:53,692 --> 01:22:56,815
(the dancing machine of YG Entertainment.)

2407
01:22:57,829 --> 01:22:59,860
(I am letting myself go.)

2408
01:22:59,864 --> 01:23:01,030
(His movements are shocking.)

2409
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:03,060
- He is good. - He is cool.

2410
01:23:03,068 --> 01:23:04,700
(Am I doing a good job?)

2411
01:23:04,703 --> 01:23:06,225
Hold on.

2412
01:23:06,304 --> 01:23:08,440
Seung Ri. Seung Ri.

2413
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,670
Seung Ri.

2414
01:23:09,674 --> 01:23:11,400
- I am sorry, but... - There are no members here.

2415
01:23:11,409 --> 01:23:12,470
Listen.

2416
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:15,680
It's strange because you are so different...

2417
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,380
when you are here without G-Dragon.

2418
01:23:17,382 --> 01:23:18,580
Seriously.

2419
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:21,310
- He is so cool. - I am finally showing the talent...

2420
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:23,480
that was inside of me.

2421
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:24,580
(Seung Ri shows his talent after 10 years.)

2422
01:23:24,589 --> 01:23:27,820
It has been dormant for 10 years. It has been aged.

2423
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:29,560
I have never taken it out before.

2424
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:30,590
It has been aged.

2425
01:23:30,595 --> 01:23:32,290
I have never taken it out before.

2426
01:23:32,297 --> 01:23:34,690
- Is that so? - Back in the days,

2427
01:23:34,699 --> 01:23:36,330
you glanced over at G-Dragon after the dance.

2428
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:37,900
- That's right. - He didn't like you acting up.

2429
01:23:37,902 --> 01:23:39,430
When I looked at him after showing my specialty,

2430
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:40,670
he went, "Stop being so flippant."

2431
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:43,140
(Grating his teeth)

2432
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:44,540
(The leader is very strict with Seung Ri.)

2433
01:23:44,542 --> 01:23:46,405
Did G-Dragon do that?

2434
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:47,610
That's right.

2435
01:23:47,612 --> 01:23:50,075
I couldn't read his mouth properly, but he went...

2436
01:23:50,081 --> 01:23:51,210
(Stop being so flippant.)

2437
01:23:51,216 --> 01:23:54,550
- He did it with a smile. - Yes, it was like that.

2438
01:23:54,552 --> 01:23:57,250
All right. We talked briefly.

2439
01:23:57,255 --> 01:24:00,650
We are now done with Sun Mi's interview.

2440
01:24:00,659 --> 01:24:02,060
- Really? - Yes.

2441
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:03,460
Didn't we go over everyone?

2442
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:04,860
- Didn't we go over everyone? - No, we haven't.

2443
01:24:04,863 --> 01:24:06,730
We are only done with Sun Mi's interview.

2444
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:07,760
Sun Mi.

2445
01:24:07,766 --> 01:24:09,460
I don't even need a lot of screen time.

2446
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:11,055
Can we stop?

2447
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:13,130
You should take a nap from time to time...

2448
01:24:13,138 --> 01:24:14,700
in the upright position.

2449
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:16,370
(The guests' interviews are precious.)

2450
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:19,370
We have Bobby with us.

2451
01:24:19,377 --> 01:24:20,470
(The rapper of iKON, Bobby)

2452
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:21,710
We finally meet.

2453
01:24:21,713 --> 01:24:24,480
You have heard of "Love Scenario" by iKON, right?

2454
01:24:24,482 --> 01:24:25,580
("Love Scenario" is a hit song by iKON.)

2455
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:28,280
It's popular among elementary school students.

2456
01:24:28,286 --> 01:24:30,280
- That's right. - It's like the national anthem.

2457
01:24:30,288 --> 01:24:31,820
Who composed the music and wrote the lyrics?

2458
01:24:31,823 --> 01:24:33,485
I did.

2459
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:34,520
(My partner is really awesome.)

2460
01:24:34,526 --> 01:24:36,855
He is really cool.

2461
01:24:36,961 --> 01:24:39,730
You might feel uncomfortable with revealing the actual numbers,

2462
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:41,360
but how much did you make with royalties?

2463
01:24:41,366 --> 01:24:43,000
- The song topped the charts... - That's right.

2464
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:44,830
for many months.

2465
01:24:44,836 --> 01:24:47,070
To be honest, I received the royalty...

2466
01:24:47,072 --> 01:24:48,270
three days ago.

2467
01:24:48,273 --> 01:24:50,100
Did it get processed only three days ago?

2468
01:24:50,108 --> 01:24:52,770
No, it was the second payment.

2469
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:54,010
- The 2nd payment. - The 1st payment...

2470
01:24:54,012 --> 01:24:55,680
was about 7,800,000 dollars.

2471
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,845
13,000,000 dollars.

2472
01:24:58,983 --> 01:25:03,150
The world isn't that easy.

2473
01:25:03,154 --> 01:25:05,820
(He is beginning to learn more about the world.)

2474
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:07,250
That was good.

2475
01:25:07,258 --> 01:25:08,860
(I promise to work harder.)

2476
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,830
I love B.I...

2477
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:13,890
and "Killing Me" so much.

2478
01:25:13,898 --> 01:25:16,325
Please give us a performance.

2479
01:25:16,401 --> 01:25:17,430
I love it.

2480
01:25:17,435 --> 01:25:19,230
I love "Killing Me" so much.

2481
01:25:19,237 --> 01:25:20,870
(I really want to see it.)

2482
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:23,495
("Killing Me" by iKON)

2483
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:25,470
(They are energetic from the start.)

2484
01:25:25,477 --> 01:25:26,470
This is it!

2485
01:25:26,478 --> 01:25:27,970
- They are incredible. - This is it.

2486
01:25:27,979 --> 01:25:29,705
This is killing me.

2487
01:25:29,981 --> 01:25:32,380
(Check out my sexiness.)

2488
01:25:32,384 --> 01:25:33,850
(Their vein-popping dance is a treat to the eyes.)

2489
01:25:33,852 --> 01:25:35,280
They are good.

2490
01:25:35,286 --> 01:25:36,915
I can't even copy them.

2491
01:25:37,255 --> 01:25:40,485
(We are iKON.)

2492
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,390
(This is the class of YG Entertainment.)

2493
01:25:43,395 --> 01:25:44,620
My goodness.

2494
01:25:44,629 --> 01:25:46,630
- Aren't they cool? - They are so cool.

2495
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:47,960
When Bobby stood next to me,

2496
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:50,460
he kept his eyes half-closed.

2497
01:25:50,468 --> 01:25:52,630
When he took the stage, he did this.

2498
01:25:52,637 --> 01:25:55,300
(I am telling you, he did this.)

2499
01:25:55,306 --> 01:25:56,540
I am serious.

2500
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,670
- Ji Hyo. - It was no joke.

2501
01:25:57,675 --> 01:25:59,410
Are you sure he did this?

2502
01:25:59,411 --> 01:26:00,440
Did I do it wrong?

2503
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:02,440
- For goodness' sake. - They are so cool.

2504
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:03,940
- They are so cool. - Hold on.

2505
01:26:03,948 --> 01:26:05,010
They surprised me.

2506
01:26:05,016 --> 01:26:06,850
- Seung Ri danced with us earlier. - That's right.

2507
01:26:06,851 --> 01:26:07,850
Did the three of you dance?

2508
01:26:07,852 --> 01:26:09,020
Seung Ri, can you dance with them?

2509
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,020
- Let's go. - Seung Ri, dance with them.

2510
01:26:11,022 --> 01:26:12,220
Now that he is...

2511
01:26:12,223 --> 01:26:14,450
the only member left from Big Bang, he does everything.

2512
01:26:14,459 --> 01:26:16,390
Let's do this.

2513
01:26:16,394 --> 01:26:18,360
(Let's do everything.)

2514
01:26:18,363 --> 01:26:19,530
Let's do this.

2515
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:22,295
(Seung Ri and iKON decide to perform "Killing Me".)

2516
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,455
White Skull, are you watching this?

2517
01:26:24,569 --> 01:26:26,070
Yigija Unit, are you watching this?

2518
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:29,095
(Are you watching this?)

2519
01:26:29,774 --> 01:26:32,570
(I see that he has a lot of pent-up anger.)

2520
01:26:32,577 --> 01:26:34,410
- What was that about? - What?

2521
01:26:34,412 --> 01:26:35,710
- Are you really okay? - Yes.

2522
01:26:35,713 --> 01:26:38,110
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am.

2523
01:26:38,116 --> 01:26:40,510
G-Dragon and the others won't be in the army forever.

2524
01:26:40,518 --> 01:26:41,650
Okay.

2525
01:26:41,653 --> 01:26:42,720
(He decides to worry about it later.)

2526
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,490
Whatever, I don't care. I'll just do it.

2527
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:47,150
(He brings out his instinct as a dancer.)

2528
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:50,085
("Killing Me" by Seung Ri and iKON)

2529
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:54,085
(Dancing in sync)

2530
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,655
(He spreads out his wings.)

2531
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:01,130
(Seung Ri soon falls out of sync.)

2532
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:03,940
- Hold on. - Hold on. This is...

2533
01:27:03,942 --> 01:27:05,100
- Jae Seok. - Seung Ri.

2534
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:06,710
He is trying to show off.

2535
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:08,370
- I have something to say. - He is trying to show off.

2536
01:27:08,379 --> 01:27:10,640
You dance to stand out, not harmonize.

2537
01:27:10,648 --> 01:27:12,710
- He wants to stand out. - You know,

2538
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:15,110
Bobby and B.I danced in harmony.

2539
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:16,250
You tried so hard to stand out.

2540
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:19,350
Because I didn't want to be outshined by iKON,

2541
01:27:19,357 --> 01:27:20,590
- Really? - so I asked my stylist...

2542
01:27:20,592 --> 01:27:22,390
if she had anything. She gave me this.

2543
01:27:22,393 --> 01:27:24,055
Is that so?

2544
01:27:24,062 --> 01:27:26,790
You should be careful of lightning.

2545
01:27:26,798 --> 01:27:28,160
It will destroy your back.

2546
01:27:28,166 --> 01:27:29,760
- Okay. - You should be careful today.

2547
01:27:29,767 --> 01:27:31,300
Stainless steel can be dangerous.

2548
01:27:31,302 --> 01:27:33,830
Seung Ri doesn't usually reveal what's inside his heart,

2549
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:35,500
but I hope he would discuss this today.

2550
01:27:35,507 --> 01:27:37,140
He joined YG Entertainment as a dancer.

2551
01:27:37,141 --> 01:27:40,970
- He is a good dancer. - Tell us about Big Bang's dance.

2552
01:27:40,979 --> 01:27:42,540
- To be honest, - He is a really good dancer.

2553
01:27:42,547 --> 01:27:45,080
there are many idol groups like BTS, Wanna One,

2554
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,650
and iKON. When you see their dance moves,

2555
01:27:47,652 --> 01:27:49,280
- they move like this. - That's right.

2556
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:50,850
Big Bang did everything.

2557
01:27:50,855 --> 01:27:53,650
We practiced with famous dancers and such.

2558
01:27:53,658 --> 01:27:56,060
However, all of Big Bang's dances turned out this way.

2559
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,890
(Swaying)

2560
01:27:57,896 --> 01:28:01,090
(It's incredibly simple.)

2561
01:28:01,099 --> 01:28:03,360
Why did we learn all these moves to begin with?

2562
01:28:03,368 --> 01:28:04,960
- Why did we learn these? - Let me sum up.

2563
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:06,870
- You're not happy with them. - Exactly.

2564
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:09,670
Can you dance to one of...

2565
01:28:09,674 --> 01:28:13,070
your songs with your own additional dance moves?

2566
01:28:13,077 --> 01:28:14,310
- Sure. - You can do this, right?

2567
01:28:14,312 --> 01:28:15,580
- Of course. - Which song will it be?

2568
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:16,780
- All right. - "Lies"?

2569
01:28:16,781 --> 01:28:18,240
- Play "Bang Bang Bang", please. - "Bang Bang Bang".

2570
01:28:18,249 --> 01:28:20,045
- "Bang Bang Bang". - "Bang Bang Bang". Gosh.

2571
01:28:20,285 --> 01:28:22,320
Did he gain weight? I keep thinking that.

2572
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,350
(But did Seung Ri gain weight too?)

2573
01:28:24,355 --> 01:28:26,790
- Hey, that was random. - Excuse me.

2574
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,420
- I'm sorry. My apologies. - Can you at least whisper?

2575
01:28:28,426 --> 01:28:29,590
Everyone keeps asking if you gained weight.

2576
01:28:29,594 --> 01:28:31,290
- Everyone is curious. - Turn off your microphones then.

2577
01:28:31,296 --> 01:28:34,260
- I can hear everything. - That's enough. Stop it now.

2578
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:35,960
I gained weight. Yes, yes, yes.

2579
01:28:35,967 --> 01:28:38,030
(Fine. I'll admit it.)

2580
01:28:38,036 --> 01:28:39,030
(He gains his freedom and weight.)

2581
01:28:39,037 --> 01:28:41,370
- Fine. I gained weight. - I'm sorry. You're about to dance.

2582
01:28:41,372 --> 01:28:44,040
- I got it. - He's cool now.

2583
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,270
I can't wait to see this.

2584
01:28:45,276 --> 01:28:47,010
(He's the most determined.)

2585
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,680
(His eyes undergo a change as soon as the song is played.)

2586
01:28:49,681 --> 01:28:51,775
(Powerful dance moves)

2587
01:28:52,283 --> 01:28:54,080
(But what is he doing?)

2588
01:28:54,085 --> 01:28:55,380
(Flapping)

2589
01:28:55,386 --> 01:28:57,145
- Isn't the original one better? - That looks weird.

2590
01:28:57,388 --> 01:28:58,380
- Hey. - Look.

2591
01:28:58,389 --> 01:29:01,090
(It does look different, but the moves look avant-garde.)

2592
01:29:01,092 --> 01:29:02,690
- Hey, that looks weird! - Wait a second.

2593
01:29:02,694 --> 01:29:04,815
- What is that? - The original is better.

2594
01:29:04,862 --> 01:29:06,260
- Hold on. The original is better. - What was that?

2595
01:29:06,264 --> 01:29:08,760
- This is from the ancient times. - Isn't this "Warrior's Descendant"?

2596
01:29:08,766 --> 01:29:11,430
- This is Seo Tai Ji's dance. - It's his dance move.

2597
01:29:11,436 --> 01:29:14,030
- White Skull... It's... - Listen.

2598
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:15,700
(His inferiority complex is activated once again.)

2599
01:29:15,707 --> 01:29:18,240
He behaves worse than Seok Jin when he's drunk.

2600
01:29:18,242 --> 01:29:19,670
What's up with you?

2601
01:29:19,677 --> 01:29:22,710
(Next week, more of Seung Ri's awesomeness will air.)

2602
01:29:22,714 --> 01:29:25,175
(This is just the beginning.)

2603
01:29:25,216 --> 01:29:26,350
(Chaotic Race...)

2604
01:29:26,351 --> 01:29:29,580
(that will win over everyone begins in earnest.)

2605
01:29:29,587 --> 01:29:32,320
(Their excitement is out of this world.)

2606
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:35,485
(These bubbly partners' special talents are beyond this world.)

2607
01:29:35,627 --> 01:29:38,885
(What's wrong with them?)

2608
01:29:38,896 --> 01:29:40,560
(And...)

2609
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:41,760
Why does that cost nine dollars?

2610
01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:44,295
(This suspicious secret brings them into deeper confusion.)

2611
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:47,465
(These couples are shocked.)

2612
01:29:47,905 --> 01:29:51,970
(They have the strangest battles to unravel the secret.)

2613
01:29:51,976 --> 01:29:55,540
(They desperately try in order to get out of the chaos.)

2614
01:29:55,546 --> 01:29:58,275
(What is the result these partners will face?)

2615
01:29:58,416 --> 01:30:00,680
(I salute to White Skull.)

2616
01:30:00,685 --> 01:30:02,780
(Are you watching this, G-Dragon?)

2617
01:30:02,787 --> 01:30:05,375
(Dangerous Choice Part 2)
