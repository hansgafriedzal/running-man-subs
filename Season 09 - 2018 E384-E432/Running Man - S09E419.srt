1
00:00:06,329 --> 00:00:09,290
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:11,800
- Did you film the TV rating notice? - Yes.

3
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:14,500
- We asked you to wear nice clothes. - That's right.

4
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,570
- The clothes are colorful. - I see some bright colors.

5
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:17,800
We wore nice clothes today.

6
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:19,540
It's nice.

7
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,325
Haha could be the SMPTE color bars.

8
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:25,280
I counted the colors. I am wearing 14 colors in total.

9
00:00:25,282 --> 00:00:26,650
(He is SMPTE color bars personified.)

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,810
I am amazed, but it suits him. It's a good outfit for him.

11
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:31,750
- The disorderly fashion. - The cute fashion.

12
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,605
The disorderly fashion.

13
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:35,750
I am amazed.

14
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,360
- Seok Jin, are you a prisoner? - Be quiet.

15
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:39,360
(His top is reminiscent of the prison bars.)

16
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:41,190
Don't say a thing about my clothes.

17
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:44,100
- The others can but not you. - Are you a prisoner?

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,900
Are you a prisoner somewhere?

19
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,830
- What are you talking about? - It seems that way.

20
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:49,700
You know nothing about fashion.

21
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:52,070
Kwang Soo attended...

22
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:55,070
Song Joong Ki's fan meeting.

23
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:57,010
- There are videos. - He attended it.

24
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,840
- Of course, he did. - They are good friends.

25
00:00:58,848 --> 00:01:00,350
You didn't say much, but you annoy me already.

26
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,280
Joong Ki is so nice. He keeps finding a use for him.

27
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:05,480
He keeps finding a use for me?

28
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:06,920
Yes. That's exactly what he is doing.

29
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:09,890
I received an official invitation as his friend.

30
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,590
Are you sure you didn't crash it?

31
00:01:11,594 --> 00:01:13,020
Perhaps you just walked up to the stage.

32
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,490
- What are you talking about? - I watched a video...

33
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:16,630
and he did this throughout the interview.

34
00:01:16,633 --> 00:01:19,260
- That's not true. - "Yes, I revere him."

35
00:01:19,269 --> 00:01:21,830
- "Yes." - I don't revere him.

36
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:23,270
It's in his nature.

37
00:01:23,273 --> 00:01:25,985
Do you know how Kwang Soo exited the stage?

38
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:28,010
Do you think I am a eunuch?

39
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,470
(Please allow your humble subject to leave now.)

40
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,240
Do you think I am a eunuch? Why would I leave like this?

41
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:33,750
"Yes, Your Majesty." Didn't you say that?

42
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,365
- "Yes, Your Majesty." - I didn't say that.

43
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:37,765
That's right.

44
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:40,250
- I exited confidently. - Really?

45
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:42,490
- I was invited. - Really?

46
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:45,020
In any case, we are grateful for Joong Ki.

47
00:01:45,028 --> 00:01:47,360
- That's right. - You should be grateful to me.

48
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,290
- He looks after you. - We thank him for looking...

49
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,400
- after Kwang Soo. - Seriously.

50
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,370
We hope he will invite Kwang Soo...

51
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,715
- to the 11th anniversary as well. - That's right.

52
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,315
Please do that.

53
00:01:57,674 --> 00:01:59,440
Song Joong Ki forever!

54
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:00,810
"Song Joong Ki forever"?

55
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,710
He needs to be popular for Kwang Soo to be popular.

56
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:04,880
My popularity has nothing to do with him.

57
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,880
(May the friendship between them last forever.)

58
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,080
You didn't learn the secret of the briefcase last week.

59
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,280
- That's right. - That's right.

60
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:13,295
- The briefcase. - I forgot about that.

61
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:20,205
(For the secret, Running Man had the Dangerous Delivery Race.)

62
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,390
(They succeeded to deliver the briefcase.)

63
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:28,485
(The staff promised to reveal the secret this week.)

64
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,470
What's the secret of the briefcase?

65
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:33,170
- The secret will be revealed today. - That's good.

66
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,840
That's only right.

67
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:37,380
- Bring in the briefcase. - Will we open it right away?

68
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,480
(Bring in the briefcase.)

69
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,010
(It's only the opening.)

70
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:41,450
- Will we open it right away? - Will we open it?

71
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:42,695
Will we open it?

72
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:44,380
- What is going on? - What is going on?

73
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:45,820
Why is there music?

74
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,090
("Sexy Back"?)

75
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,890
- "Sexy Back". - Why is there music?

76
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,020
(Is "Sexy Back" announcing a guest?)

77
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,090
What is going on?

78
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:53,275
- Do Yeon! - Jang Do Yeon.

79
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:55,260
- Do Yeon. - What are you doing here?

80
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,800
- Do Yeon. - Jang Do Feet.

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,515
(The tall femme fatale, Jang Do Yeon)

82
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:06,485
(She shook up Running Man with her big feet.)

83
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,285
(Jang Do Feet is here.)

84
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:12,855
(Sexy)

85
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,280
- Hey! - My goodness.

86
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:17,020
(She exudes the charms they can't handle.)

87
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,465
- Her feet are really big. - My goodness.

88
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:23,390
- Jang Do Feet. - Don't talk about my feet.

89
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:25,790
It must be true that you wear size 300mm.

90
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:27,630
I wear size 300mm.

91
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,190
You wear size 300mm.

92
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,615
I should bring her shoes that are big for me.

93
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,770
Share your shoes with her.

94
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,900
- You shouldn't be rude to me. - We aren't rude to you.

95
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:38,155
I am the briefcase girl.

96
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:40,870
- That explains "Sexy Back". - "Sexy Back".

97
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:43,780
Do Yeon, I heard that you rarely have a day off.

98
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,710
The thing is, I don't have any work that represents me.

99
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:48,080
I am the peddler of variety shows.

100
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,080
(She goes everywhere.)

101
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:52,020
- You are looking to settle down. - I go everywhere.

102
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:55,020
- You will get to settle down. - That's right.

103
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:57,360
Today, my work is here.

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,090
I am looking for a show to pick me up.

105
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:02,990
You should visit different shows...

106
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,100
and stick your foot in a show you like.

107
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:08,100
- That's right. I am busy. - How is Running Man?

108
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:09,430
Don't you want to stick your foot in it?

109
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,670
I have made many attempts,

110
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,270
but they have no place for me.

111
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:15,740
(They have no place for me.)

112
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,880
- I will come and go. - Okay.

113
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,380
I will come and go before they forget about me.

114
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:23,265
- That's good. - Do Yeon is quick-witted.

115
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,935
She is sharp.

116
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:26,990
Do Yeon is quick-witted.

117
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,190
Some people are slow-witted.

118
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,965
(Glancing)

119
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:33,235
- Some people are slow-witted. - You are too kind.

120
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:37,915
(He glances at the slow-witted member.)

121
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:39,730
Hold on. Who were you looking at?

122
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,130
- Where did you look? - Do you mean him?

123
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,430
- Make this work. - What do you mean?

124
00:04:42,438 --> 00:04:43,870
- Did you just look at me? - His face turned red.

125
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,940
Seok Jin's face turned red. That means he's really angry.

126
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,240
- I didn't. - You little runt.

127
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:50,210
- Did you look at me? - What did I do?

128
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:52,040
I think you looked at me the longest.

129
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,495
You were just standing there when I turned.

130
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,580
By the way,

131
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,095
- Do Yeon brought us the briefcase. - Right.

132
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:58,980
- Exactly. - Actually, today,

133
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,905
- I'll have a major role. - Is that so?

134
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,750
- My gosh. - You brought us the briefcase.

135
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,835
I'll play the role of Heo Cham, the host.

136
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,590
- I brought this for a reason. - What is that?

137
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:10,775
- Can I look at my script? - Sure.

138
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:13,515
- You're hosting today. Nice. - She's honest.

139
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:16,570
Today, we must reveal the secret behind this briefcase...

140
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:19,000
- you safely delivered last week. - You should let us know today.

141
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:20,240
- All right. - Right.

142
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,680
Dangerous Delivery Part Two. The Secret of the Briefcase.

143
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,980
(She's cheerful and energetic.)

144
00:05:25,982 --> 00:05:28,610
(Everyone gets excited at her old style of hosting from the 90s.)

145
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:30,280
- The Briefcase's Secret. - Hold on.

146
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:33,450
- You're good. - This is an old style of hosting.

147
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,990
- Everyone, brace yourselves. - She prepared this. Okay.

148
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,535
In this briefcase,

149
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,060
- there is a three-digit passcode. - Is that so?

150
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,130
You will complete missions in order to acquire hints.

151
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,000
You must open it with the hints to find out what's inside.

152
00:05:47,003 --> 00:05:49,300
If you don't find out the secret of the briefcase in the end,

153
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,770
two members will be chosen by the roulette for the penalty.

154
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,470
If you fail the mission,

155
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:56,540
you must put your names on the slots...

156
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:59,140
in order to acquire hints from us.

157
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:00,780
You must put your name up for the hints.

158
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:03,450
If you can't open the briefcase before you fill up the roulette,

159
00:06:03,453 --> 00:06:05,280
you will fail the final mission.

160
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,690
- After filling up the roulette... - Excuse me.

161
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,735
Do you need to be somewhere after this?

162
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,775
It feels like she's rushed.

163
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,230
I have a specific role today.

164
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,530
I used to come here for an easy time,

165
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:18,100
but trying to host this now is kind of hard.

166
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,460
All right.

167
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,345
We'll meet after you change into your team uniforms.

168
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:23,985
- We have to change into uniforms? - Yes, yes.

169
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,040
- Okay. - You're a great host.

170
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,385
No, I'm not.

171
00:06:28,811 --> 00:06:32,210
(A mission to obtain the first hint about the briefcase's secret)

172
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:34,450
(Why is there a balloon set in the empty studio?)

173
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,580
- What is this? - Welcome.

174
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:38,480
- What is this, Do Yeon? - There's a balloon.

175
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:41,320
- How many roles do you have today? - Come this way.

176
00:06:41,324 --> 00:06:42,950
I'm just doing this and that.

177
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,290
- What is that? - I'm scared.

178
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:45,490
- Isn't that a water bomb? - All right.

179
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,490
- Is that water? Darn it. - This is water.

180
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,960
Everyone, you will start your mission to find out...

181
00:06:49,966 --> 00:06:51,760
- the briefcase's secret. - Okay.

182
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:54,530
Everyone, what's our national holiday?

183
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:55,700
- Chuseok. - That's right.

184
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,400
What do we look at on Chuseok?

185
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:58,700
- Full moon. - That's correct!

186
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,610
The name of this mission is...

187
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,770
When the Full Moon Sets

188
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:06,425
(The name of this mission is When the Full Moon Sets.)

189
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:10,150
- Full moon? - She's a little weird.

190
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,480
- Did you prepare it or improvise? - Is that your theme?

191
00:07:12,488 --> 00:07:13,990
The theme of my hosting is retro.

192
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,550
- Retro? I get it. - I'll go back to the old style.

193
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:17,190
- This is a vintage style. - I see.

194
00:07:17,193 --> 00:07:19,120
- It's vintage. - That's trending now.

195
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,590
Let me explain about When the Full Moon Sets.

196
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,130
- You'll sit in this chair. - Okay.

197
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,730
You must lower the balloon to the Safe Zone.

198
00:07:25,735 --> 00:07:27,230
- We have to stop it? - Yes.

199
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,570
- You grab, let go, and grab again. - We can do this.

200
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:33,270
- But when Kwang Soo sits down... - That's not the problem.

201
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:34,540
- He will go over the line. - What if...

202
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:36,985
I sit down and go over the Safe Zone?

203
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,480
But he has long legs.

204
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,355
- Your upper body isn't that long. - Right.

205
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:42,265
No, Kwang Soo has a longer upper body than a lower body.

206
00:07:42,318 --> 00:07:43,450
No, no.

207
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,520
- That's not true. - He's upset.

208
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,050
Stop lying. You're 190cm tall.

209
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,620
Isn't your upper body about 150cm long?

210
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,450
Then are my legs about 40cm?

211
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:51,460
- Is that why you always... - My legs are only 40cm long?

212
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,090
Those legs are only 40cm long?

213
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:54,590
- Aren't I right? - No, you're wrong.

214
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:55,990
- I'm wrong? - You're wrong.

215
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,200
- You're wrong. - Do you know what this is?

216
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,360
This is Kwang Soo.

217
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,015
What are you doing?

218
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:02,800
(She artistically interprets the giraffe's sadness.)

219
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,715
- What is that? - What do you think? It's you.

220
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,840
- Tone it down. - Okay.

221
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,625
- Lower your hand. - I'm sorry.

222
00:08:09,378 --> 00:08:10,480
(She's unbelievable.)

223
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,195
You must make it look like his head.

224
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:13,950
(He can't refute it.)

225
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,010
- This is unbelievable. - Every one of you...

226
00:08:16,018 --> 00:08:17,780
will try to complete this mission,

227
00:08:17,787 --> 00:08:19,450
but you will choose the number of members that...

228
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,750
must succeed with a die.

229
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,250
(The die will decide the number of members that must succeed.)

230
00:08:22,258 --> 00:08:24,220
- It purely depends on luck. - The lower it is, the better it is.

231
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,260
If we get number one, it'd be awesome.

232
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,460
- Here's one important point. - What is it?

233
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,160
- I'm the Briefcase Girl today. - Yes.

234
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,000
- Is hosting my only job today? - Okay.

235
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,770
You may have a chance to use me.

236
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,700
(They can get 1 more chance to try with Do Yeon Chance Card.)

237
00:08:36,706 --> 00:08:39,040
- What is it? - If I join you on the mission...

238
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,570
and if you succeed, you'll get two hints.

239
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,410
- We must use that chance then. - We should.

240
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:44,740
- Is that so? - That's important.

241
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:46,810
- However, there is a twist. - We should use that chance.

242
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:49,365
If you fail the mission, you'll get the forehead flick.

243
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,080
One of you must face it.

244
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,050
- We must use Ms. Feet well. - The forehead flick.

245
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:55,490
- Excuse me, "Ms. Feet"? - Hold on.

246
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:57,920
- Everyone. - You wore smaller shoes on purpose.

247
00:08:57,927 --> 00:08:59,690
You wore smaller shoes on purpose.

248
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,760
- I think your toes are touching. - Are you scrunching your toes?

249
00:09:01,764 --> 00:09:04,030
Here's what you must look out for.

250
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:06,160
That time when I was on Running Man,

251
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,645
I measured my feet with Jong Kook and Se Chan.

252
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:11,400
- A lot of people messaged me. - What did they say?

253
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:12,855
They all have big feet.

254
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:15,170
"Do Yeon, my feet size is 290mm."

255
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,225
"Where can I buy my shoes?"

256
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,710
- "Keep your chin up, big foot!" - How nice of them.

257
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,610
- I got so many messages. - That's nice.

258
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,550
- Ms. Feet, that's awesome. - It's great.

259
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:24,920
- She's Grand Feet. - So...

260
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:26,750
- Grand Feet? - Yes, Grand Feet.

261
00:09:26,756 --> 00:09:27,890
Having big feet is great.

262
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:30,020
- Hold on. - Grand Feet.

263
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:32,220
- Ji Hyo will try it. - Go ahead.

264
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:33,690
- Ji Hyo gets lucky. - Yes.

265
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,890
All right. Start. Start, Ji Hyo.

266
00:09:34,897 --> 00:09:36,790
- Start. I'll throw it higher. - Start.

267
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,875
- Go rough with that. Don't mind it. - I don't know.

268
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,900
(The die has been cast.)

269
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:48,170
(Please let that be a low number.)

270
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,525
Be rough with that.

271
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,850
(The number of members for the 1st mission is 3.)

272
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,210
- Three. - That wasn't bad.

273
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,580
- That wasn't bad. - She picked a good number.

274
00:09:57,587 --> 00:09:58,720
- She picked three. - See?

275
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,090
- She's pretty good. - Right.

276
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,565
- Three is a great number. - That's nice.

277
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,760
Which one of you will go first then?

278
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,490
- Okay. Jong Kook will go 1st then. - Jong Kook, you go 1st.

279
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,605
- That must be hard to do it alone. - Put this fur cap on.

280
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
- It won't be easy. - It's not easy.

281
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:13,730
- It's not. - Pull it all the way up.

282
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:14,900
It's not easy.

283
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,170
(He puts on the fur cap with tacks.)

284
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,900
(He feels nervous after sitting under the massive water balloon.)

285
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,270
- All right. Say, "start". - It will pop at once.

286
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,440
- My goodness. - You passed now.

287
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:24,840
- About this much? - This would pass.

288
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,380
- Is this good enough? - You have to raise a bit higher.

289
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:28,480
- Raise it higher. - That would count as a success.

290
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:29,910
- I can raise it higher? - Raise it up to this point.

291
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,095
You have to know when to stop.

292
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:34,190
- Move back. The water will splash. - Start!

293
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,750
- Everyone, count for him. - Look at the water balloon.

294
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:37,220
1, 2, 3.

295
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:38,505
- Start! - Start!

296
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,790
All right.

297
00:10:39,795 --> 00:10:47,445
(Will Jong Kook, the first member, be able to complete the mission?)

298
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,870
(He survived without popping the water balloon.)

299
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:57,440
- It's almost touching. - How could he do that?

300
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,410
- It's almost touching. - This is amazing.

301
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:00,650
- It's incredible. - He's so good.

302
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,095
- What is this? - What should I do?

303
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,610
- It's a success! - This has to count as a success.

304
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:05,435
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

305
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:07,505
- Gosh, I almost popped it. - That was awesome.

306
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,890
(It's hard to believe their eyes.)

307
00:11:09,892 --> 00:11:12,060
- You're so lucky. - My gosh.

308
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,460
- One of us succeeded it. - All right.

309
00:11:14,463 --> 00:11:15,830
(So Min will try next.)

310
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,305
I'm so certain.

311
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,830
- I'm so certain that she'll fail. - No, I won't.

312
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,215
So Min will definitely pop it.

313
00:11:21,437 --> 00:11:22,745
- No. - We should move back.

314
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,540
Since Jong Kook succeeded, if you also succeed,

315
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,355
- We need 2 members to succeed. - we just need 1 more person.

316
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,755
All right.

317
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:30,210
- I'll count and grab it. - Right.

318
00:11:30,212 --> 00:11:31,940
You have to count in your head.

319
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,255
Here I go.

320
00:11:33,282 --> 00:11:34,625
Start.

321
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:39,020
(She fails within 1 second.)

322
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:40,350
My goodness.

323
00:11:40,356 --> 00:11:42,850
(It's expected of her.)

324
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,575
- My goodness. - Darn it.

325
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,690
(What just happened?)

326
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:50,490
(The huge balloon was so scary.)

327
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:51,845
Poor you.

328
00:11:52,068 --> 00:11:53,130
- That was huge. - Wait.

329
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:56,245
So Min grabbed the rope after the balloon popped.

330
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,370
(After the water balloon popped,)

331
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:04,025
(she grabbed the rope but to no avail.)

332
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:06,080
- So Min. - You didn't grab it?

333
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,910
- That's all right. - She did, but she was late.

334
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,210
I grabbed it right here.

335
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,880
- I grabbed it here. - You did grab it.

336
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,495
So Min, your hair looks great.

337
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:14,205
- It looks awesome. - It's all right.

338
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,750
- She looks like Byung Ok. - Great. Great.

339
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,060
- You look like Byung Ok. - Byung Ok.

340
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:20,475
Byung Ok in "Lady Vengeance".

341
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,330
- He played my father in a drama. - Right.

342
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,130
- "Dad". - She looks like Byung Ok.

343
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,230
(It's the same bob haircut, but it looks different.)

344
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:29,015
- You are so lucky. - I know, right?

345
00:12:29,205 --> 00:12:31,340
- I had no idea it'd be this bad. - Seriously.

346
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,540
Seok Ju, isn't this fun?

347
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,010
- Who is Seok Ju? - Seok Ju.

348
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,570
Are you talking about Ha Seok Ju?

349
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,310
- What are you talking about? - Ha Seok Ju.

350
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:38,825
"Seok Ju, isn't this fun?"

351
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:42,210
(As of now, only Jong Kook succeeded.)

352
00:12:42,218 --> 00:12:44,450
- Kwang Soo, just take a seat. - Take a seat.

353
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:45,650
- Here I go. I'll do it. - Just take a seat for now.

354
00:12:45,654 --> 00:12:47,650
- Seok Ju, you must succeed. - Okay, okay.

355
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,050
I'm not Seok Ju.

356
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:50,650
- Ha Seok Ju. I'm serious. - Let me really try.

357
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,005
Why did you do that in the match against Mexico?

358
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:54,630
- What do you mean? - You tackled the player.

359
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,030
Why did you tackle that player all of a sudden? Hold on.

360
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,260
(My gosh, you little...)

361
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:00,970
(Do you want me to hurt you with this fur cap?)

362
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,485
Don't bump your head into him.

363
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:05,640
- You look so cool right now. - You look great now.

364
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:08,355
- You look great now. - You look handsome.

365
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:11,355
- This looks great on you. - You look great.

366
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:13,410
- You look great with accessories. - You're a man from the future.

367
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,825
You look great.

368
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,525
- You look like a robot. - He has three eyeballs.

369
00:13:17,953 --> 00:13:20,595
- Can you make robot sounds? - Yes, try that.

370
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,135
Try it.

371
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,205
Hold on.

372
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:27,290
- If you're late, it's futile. - Yes, do it before it pops.

373
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:28,705
- It happened to So Min too. - That's right.

374
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:31,630
- Kwang Soo, take this seriously. - Okay.

375
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:34,215
By the way, am I the only one who thinks that...

376
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,685
he looks pathetic right now?

377
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,400
- Kwang Soo is always like that. - You just need to win.

378
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,570
- He's always like that. - I hunched forward for the game.

379
00:13:40,576 --> 00:13:42,210
- I did it for the game. - Great. That's great.

380
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:43,440
You just need to complete the mission.

381
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:45,510
You can feel it coming down. You can feel it.

382
00:13:45,514 --> 00:13:46,895
Start.

383
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:55,490
I can't do this. I can't. Listen.

384
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,605
(I can't do this.)

385
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:00,220
In my head, I let go of the rope, but I can't do it in real life.

386
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:01,760
- Just do it. - Fine, I'll do it.

387
00:14:01,764 --> 00:14:03,230
- It feels like diving, right? - Please understand me.

388
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:04,600
- Yes. - It feels like that, right?

389
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,930
- I know how that feels. - He's not mentally ready.

390
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:07,300
You can't let go of it, right?

391
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:08,430
- I'll do it. - Go ahead.

392
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:12,370
(He will really try it this time.)

393
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,755
- Start. - Start.

394
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:16,855
Come on.

395
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:21,010
(Kwang Soo was bound to fail anyway.)

396
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,725
You should have grabbed it sooner.

397
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,650
That's all right.

398
00:14:24,653 --> 00:14:28,605
Gosh, the water splashed on you completely.

399
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:29,790
It completely splashed on you.

400
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:31,805
Kwang Soo, you didn't know when to stop.

401
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:34,075
- Gosh, this is bad. - Hey, you got a new hat.

402
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:37,005
You look great.

403
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,130
- It looks nice on you. - What is it?

404
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:40,800
(The future human receives a kindergarten hat.)

405
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:42,915
- It looks like a kindergarten hat. - Right.

406
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:46,255
It won't be easy to succeed three times.

407
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,425
Kwang Soo is completely wet on the front.

408
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:49,810
Kwang Soo, your pants...

409
00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:51,940
- They're completely wet. - He was almost lying down.

410
00:14:51,947 --> 00:14:53,495
Why were you lying down?

411
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:56,250
I mean. I wanted to succeed.

412
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:57,965
- They're completely soaked. - What?

413
00:14:59,088 --> 00:15:00,295
What?

414
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,990
What?

415
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:03,820
- You can go now. - Go where?

416
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:05,760
Your pants are too wet. Go home.

417
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,460
It's been blurred out.

418
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,390
What are you talking about? What's wrong?

419
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:10,590
(If you're wet on the front, you get blurred out and must leave.)

420
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,875
Go home.

421
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,415
- Why would I go home? - Your pants are wet.

422
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:17,540
I think yours will get wet soon. Let's go home together.

423
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,770
Give me a ride.

424
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:20,910
Be quiet.

425
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,870
We're going in the same direction anyway.

426
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:24,940
I'll show you I can succeed.

427
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:26,440
I've done it before.

428
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:27,650
- Done what? - When?

429
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,795
- We've done it many times. - We have.

430
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:31,280
Have you ever succeeded?

431
00:15:31,287 --> 00:15:32,350
No.

432
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:33,450
(Embarrassed)

433
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:36,650
- Show us how to succeed. - I'll show you.

434
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,990
Jae Seok is good at this kind of games.

435
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:40,860
(Will the fourth player, Jae Seok, succeed?)

436
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm not doing it yet.

437
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,960
- I'm just practicing. - Check the distance.

438
00:15:43,966 --> 00:15:45,130
- That's perfect. - That's perfect.

439
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:47,315
- It has to touch the line. - I did it on purpose.

440
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,270
(He remembers the distance.)

441
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:51,970
- You'll remember the distance? - I just have to hold there now.

442
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,070
Okay.

443
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,640
- That's a great plan. - See?

444
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:56,010
(Jae Seok is so experienced and clever.)

445
00:15:56,011 --> 00:15:57,510
(He even marks the spot.)

446
00:15:57,513 --> 00:15:59,040
I remembered the spot.

447
00:15:59,048 --> 00:16:00,440
(He is well-prepared.)

448
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:02,250
Are you sure you can hold it exactly there?

449
00:16:02,251 --> 00:16:04,480
- Of course. - It sounds difficult.

450
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,550
(Has he really thought it through?)

451
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:06,880
Be quiet.

452
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:08,750
- If he succeeds, we'll do this. - Right.

453
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:11,105
- Hold on. Take off your glasses. - Why?

454
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,575
Just in case.

455
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:14,390
It doesn't matter at all.

456
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,390
It doesn't.

457
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,330
Are you...

458
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,945
feeling sad?

459
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:22,170
(Depressed)

460
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,200
(It seems like he's laughing.)

461
00:16:23,205 --> 00:16:24,970
He looks like he's about to cry.

462
00:16:24,974 --> 00:16:26,100
He's about to cry.

463
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:29,110
(Is it just me or is he really about to cry?)

464
00:16:29,111 --> 00:16:30,440
I always thought he smiled a lot,

465
00:16:30,446 --> 00:16:32,080
but he actually looks like he's about to cry.

466
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:33,340
I look like I'm about to cry?

467
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,565
- What are you talking about? - I mean...

468
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,295
He needs his glasses.

469
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,505
- He should never get surgery. - He needs his glasses.

470
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,190
Start.

471
00:16:43,192 --> 00:16:46,035
(Even his face is well-suited for variety shows. Jae Seok starts.)

472
00:16:46,495 --> 00:16:48,090
Show us that you can succeed.

473
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:49,805
He's going to hold that?

474
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:51,930
I'm worried he can't see the mark.

475
00:16:51,934 --> 00:16:53,600
- I can't see it well. - He can't see it.

476
00:16:53,602 --> 00:16:54,800
(He really can't see it well.)

477
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,170
- I can't... - Can you even see it?

478
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:57,430
Why can't I see it?

479
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:58,870
- Or... - If I throw it forward...

480
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,070
You can do it.

481
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:01,310
- I can do it. - Why don't we tie this around it?

482
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,310
- Okay. - Do it.

483
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,710
- That's a great idea. - Is this really necessary?

484
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:04,810
(Now it'll be impossible to miss it.)

485
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:06,880
If he still fails...

486
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,010
It's impossible.

487
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:09,250
Okay. Done.

488
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll grab that. I'm sure I can do it.

489
00:17:10,986 --> 00:17:12,280
- It'll get in the way. - Start.

490
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:13,535
(He really starts.)

491
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:18,660
(The balloon is supposed to get in the way.)

492
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,060
(Will this variety show master succeed?)

493
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:22,305
- When you feel it, just grab it. - Okay.

494
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:28,900
Oh, no. My goodness.

495
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:30,900
(What?)

496
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:33,840
(The balloon just passed.)

497
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,710
(Crying)

498
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:37,370
You completely missed it.

499
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,910
You completely missed it. It wasn't even close.

500
00:17:39,915 --> 00:17:42,810
You're holding a lot lower.

501
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:45,020
That was completely pointless.

502
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,680
It's not easy.

503
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:49,650
Did you use a ruler when you cut your hair?

504
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:53,160
(Jong Kook notices something.)

505
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:56,545
How can it be so neat?

506
00:17:56,932 --> 00:17:58,800
It just happened.

507
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,830
There was a boy in my class who looked like this.

508
00:18:00,836 --> 00:18:02,900
Did your son cut it?

509
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,670
- It just turned out this way. - For fun?

510
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:07,270
(Jae Seok fails.)

511
00:18:07,276 --> 00:18:09,570
I thought it'd work, but it didn't.

512
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:11,855
- Gosh. - The rest of you.

513
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:14,310
- Should we use Do Yeon Chance Card? - How many are left?

514
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:15,950
- 4. - Out of the 4,

515
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:17,580
- 2 have to succeed. - That's too...

516
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:19,050
Let's try. We can do it.

517
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,835
You have to succeed.

518
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,320
- Let me try. - Please succeed.

519
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:24,935
- It's too fast. - You just have to guess.

520
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,590
- There you go. - Don't move.

521
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:28,345
All right. Haha.

522
00:18:28,464 --> 00:18:30,105
Drop, pull.

523
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:32,200
- Let's do this. - Start.

524
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:33,500
- Good luck. - Start.

525
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,815
(Determined)

526
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:38,500
You have to succeed.

527
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:40,000
- No. - No.

528
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,785
- I knew it. - He looked...

529
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:44,310
(Scared)

530
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:45,610
- I knew it. - He looked...

531
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:47,595
Hey, come on.

532
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:49,110
That was so embarrassing.

533
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,480
He looked like a coward.

534
00:18:51,487 --> 00:18:54,520
I've never seen a man who's so pathetic in my life.

535
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:56,720
Let me try again.

536
00:18:56,725 --> 00:18:57,890
(He is such a coward that he gets another chance.)

537
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,505
He's such a coward.

538
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:01,530
With your foot...

539
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:02,530
(Cheating)

540
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:04,245
- Me? - Okay.

541
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:06,045
(Give me a sign with your foot.)

542
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,945
Haha. Look.

543
00:19:08,337 --> 00:19:09,585
Start.

544
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:11,970
You won't be able to see it.

545
00:19:11,974 --> 00:19:12,970
(I'll trust your foot.)

546
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,840
I'll give you a sign. Look at my foot.

547
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,325
(I'll give you a sign. Look at my foot.)

548
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:20,225
(Splash)

549
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:25,750
(Se Chan gave a sign when the balloon burst.)

550
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:28,420
(Identity Change 2)

551
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:30,620
I gave a sign when the balloon burst.

552
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:31,720
Me too.

553
00:19:31,727 --> 00:19:34,105
- When the balloon burst. - When the balloon burst.

554
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:35,630
- When the balloon burst. - It doesn't work.

555
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:38,560
- It's too difficult. - We'll probably fail.

556
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,900
I think we should use Do Yeon Chance Card.

557
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:40,960
Let's do that.

558
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:43,470
We should keep it for later.

559
00:19:43,472 --> 00:19:45,840
Two have to succeed. We'll play Race of Wits.

560
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,910
- Okay. - The three of us?

561
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,910
You can do it.

562
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,540
- Start. - One.

563
00:19:50,546 --> 00:19:51,995
- 2. - 3.

564
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:53,640
You.

565
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:54,650
(Puzzled)

566
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,650
(He lost while being too careful.)

567
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:58,150
- You. - You guys planned it, right?

568
00:19:58,153 --> 00:20:00,150
- We didn't. - You did.

569
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,235
What is he talking about?

570
00:20:02,357 --> 00:20:05,020
- We've never cheated. - You guys cheated.

571
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:06,860
We've never cheated in Race of Wits.

572
00:20:06,862 --> 00:20:08,330
How can three people play Race of Wits?

573
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,830
- What's the problem? - What's the problem?

574
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,760
- It's no problem, right? - It's no problem.

575
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:12,930
(Will he be able to succeed?)

576
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,575
- He might succeed. - I...

577
00:20:14,636 --> 00:20:15,830
- Okay. - How do you do it?

578
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:17,200
- Hold it... - It's so heavy.

579
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:18,200
Lower it.

580
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,940
Don't lower your head.

581
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,840
Say, "Start."

582
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,270
Please succeed.

583
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:25,210
He has to succeed.

584
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,240
Seriously.

585
00:20:26,248 --> 00:20:28,550
- We have only two chances left. - Okay.

586
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,680
(Will he succeed?)

587
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,635
- Ready. - Start.

588
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,635
I'll do it.

589
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:41,330
(Will the oldest member succeed?)

590
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,800
- Gosh, it hurts. - What hurts?

591
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,130
- What's wrong? - What hurts?

592
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,715
Where are my gloves?

593
00:20:49,805 --> 00:20:51,655
He has no gloves.

594
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,040
Where are my gloves?

595
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,610
Jae Seok, take care of Seok Jin.

596
00:20:55,611 --> 00:20:57,640
Why didn't anyone give me gloves?

597
00:20:57,646 --> 00:21:00,740
- Last time, you forgot your cup. - You should have taken them.

598
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:03,265
- Don't forget things again. - It hurts so much.

599
00:21:03,318 --> 00:21:04,750
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

600
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:06,735
(He's like a big baby.)

601
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,120
- Give him a sign. - Gosh.

602
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:10,520
- Okay. - Okay.

603
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:11,990
- Say, "Start." - Start.

604
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:14,420
(Jae Seok is ready to play a trick.)

605
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:17,275
(Seok Jin looks so serious.)

606
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,500
- My son is watching. - It's important.

607
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,945
My son is watching.

608
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,885
He said, "My son is watching."

609
00:21:23,205 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, my.

610
00:21:24,206 --> 00:21:25,200
What...

611
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:26,200
(Seok Jin starts.)

612
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,715
What's wrong?

613
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:33,340
(Jae Seok is stepping on the rope.)

614
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,380
(The balloon is not coming down.)

615
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:36,950
(Gosh, that brat.)

616
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:39,450
My timing was perfect.

617
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,890
It was incredible. 1, 2, pull.

618
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,250
(Is he my enemy?)

619
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,235
Gosh. What's with you?

620
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:46,420
(I love playing tricks.)

621
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:48,730
- Don't do it again. - I won't.

622
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,330
I might punch you.

623
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:51,575
(If you do it again, I might punch you.)

624
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,860
How manly.

625
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:54,360
I haven't had candies in a while.

626
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:55,785
(You mean your honey punch?)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

627
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,615
I can't believe their conversation.

628
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,340
(Their combined age is over 100.)

629
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:00,700
They're like that.

630
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,540
It's so funny. I don't think his punch will hurt.

631
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,080
(Hurt)

632
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
It's a honey punch.

633
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,055
I'm going to succeed.

634
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:09,650
Start.

635
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,110
(He really starts.)

636
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,280
1, 2, 3.

637
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,495
He succeeded!

638
00:22:14,189 --> 00:22:15,920
(The balloon didn't burst.)

639
00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:17,805
He succeeded!

640
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,390
(Seok Jin succeeds for the first time in a long time.)

641
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:23,460
Unbelievable.

642
00:22:23,465 --> 00:22:24,530
(He looks like a different person.)

643
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:25,945
Seok Jin.

644
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:27,730
(Seok Jin did it.)

645
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:30,800
Now, we have a chance. We have a chance.

646
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,170
(Jong Kook and Seok Jin have succeeded so far.)

647
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:33,540
What happened?

648
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,740
Wasn't it incredible?

649
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:35,910
- I grabbed it just in time. - It was amazing.

650
00:22:35,911 --> 00:22:36,940
It was perfect.

651
00:22:36,945 --> 00:22:38,040
- Only one more needs to succeed. - We have a chance.

652
00:22:38,046 --> 00:22:39,080
- Only one more. - Between Ji Hyo and me.

653
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,740
Se Chan, if you succeed, we're done.

654
00:22:40,749 --> 00:22:42,910
(The seventh player, Se Chan, starts.)

655
00:22:42,918 --> 00:22:44,695
Is it "drop, pull"?

656
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,195
Drop, pull.

657
00:22:46,655 --> 00:22:47,990
Not "drop, pull".

658
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,165
- Drop, pull. - Drop, pull.

659
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:52,275
- Drop, pull. - It works.

660
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:54,705
If Se Chan succeeds, we're done.

661
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:58,760
(If Se Chan succeeds, the first mission will be complete.)

662
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,000
- Start. - Start.

663
00:23:00,002 --> 00:23:03,445
(Will "drop, pull" work this time too?)

664
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,055
Start.

665
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:10,055
(Drop...)

666
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,855
He failed.

667
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:16,410
(The balloon drops,)

668
00:23:16,418 --> 00:23:19,665
(and he pulls too late.)

669
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,180
It worked last time.

670
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,220
(Se Chan fails.)

671
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,350
(No one can imitate my "drop, pull" skill.)

672
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,235
I ran out of luck.

673
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,960
- We still have Ji Hyo. - Yes. We can do it.

674
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,390
It's our last chance.

675
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,900
(If Ji Hyo fails, they won't get a hint.)

676
00:23:32,901 --> 00:23:34,530
- Higher. - It's too fast.

677
00:23:34,536 --> 00:23:36,345
Drop, pull.

678
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:38,300
- Drop, pull. - Drop, pull.

679
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,470
- Drop, pull. - There you go.

680
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:42,170
It should work.

681
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,640
- Drop, pull. - Drop, pull.

682
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:45,325
That's enough.

683
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:47,155
We should be fair.

684
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,610
We should be fair. She can't keep practicing.

685
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:50,965
How long are you going to practice?

686
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,650
He's so cold.

687
00:23:52,654 --> 00:23:55,250
What are you doing? It's for our team's success.

688
00:23:55,257 --> 00:23:57,050
Still...

689
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,635
She shouldn't succeed every day.

690
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,705
Oh, my.

691
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:02,360
(Seok Jin is jealous.)

692
00:24:02,364 --> 00:24:03,460
(He accidentally speaks his mind.)

693
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,030
What are you doing?

694
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,100
- Oh, my. - What is this?

695
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:08,870
- You should succeed too then. - Come on.

696
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,415
- What is this? - We're a team today.

697
00:24:12,474 --> 00:24:15,770
He wants Ji Hyo to fail so that he'll stand out.

698
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:19,855
He wasn't even trying to be funny. He's just mean.

699
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:21,280
He's just mean.

700
00:24:21,283 --> 00:24:22,610
Seriously...

701
00:24:22,617 --> 00:24:24,680
- We're a team today. - Good luck.

702
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:26,380
- I just wanted to motivate you. - "Good luck"?

703
00:24:26,388 --> 00:24:28,090
- He wanted to motivate her? - I just wanted to motivate you.

704
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,150
- Ready. - You have to succeed.

705
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,865
You can do it, Ji Hyo. Drop, pull.

706
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,790
- Start. - All right.

707
00:24:32,794 --> 00:24:34,275
(The last try)

708
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:37,830
(Everything is in Ji Hyo's hands now.)

709
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,500
(If she fails, they won't get the first hint.)

710
00:24:40,502 --> 00:24:41,670
I'm scared.

711
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,400
(What will be the result?)

712
00:24:43,405 --> 00:24:44,900
- Start. - Go.

713
00:24:44,906 --> 00:24:46,400
Let's do it.

714
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:48,085
(Drop, pull.)

715
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:49,955
- Drop, pull. - Pull.

716
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,555
She got it.

717
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:53,980
You did it.

718
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,395
(She's safe.)

719
00:24:55,717 --> 00:24:56,880
(She does it perfectly.)

720
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:58,495
You got it.

721
00:24:58,687 --> 00:24:59,680
(They clear the first mission.)

722
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:01,805
- Okay. - We got it.

723
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,635
That was amazing.

724
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,260
- You made it. - Okay.

725
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,060
- Good job. - That was unbelievable.

726
00:25:07,062 --> 00:25:09,060
- My hand is trembling. - That was amazing.

727
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,590
We're safe from the roulette.

728
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,060
That's right. I'll give you a hint about the passcode.

729
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:15,370
- Really? - The passcode.

730
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,085
Can we guess it right away?

731
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:20,370
"It's bigger than Jae Seok but smaller than Haha."

732
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,585
What?

733
00:25:22,377 --> 00:25:26,695
(Something bigger than Jae Seok but smaller than Haha.)

734
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:28,980
- Wait a minute. - It can't be someone's height.

735
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:31,025
Can we say it here?

736
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,050
- Wait a minute. - Is it okay?

737
00:25:33,054 --> 00:25:34,220
- Wait. - What are you saying?

738
00:25:34,222 --> 00:25:37,050
I mean... His is fine too.

739
00:25:37,058 --> 00:25:39,460
- What's funny? - You'll become a great man.

740
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:42,130
If it's bigger than Jae Seok but smaller than Haha, it's Se Chan.

741
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,590
Stop it. I said stop it.

742
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,430
- Goodness. - Come to the back with me.

743
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:50,530
Fine. I'm confident about it compared to you.

744
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,870
They're leaving. Get the camera ready.

745
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:55,070
- Kwang Soo. - Where are you going?

746
00:25:55,076 --> 00:25:57,755
- What are you trying to say? - Wait.

747
00:25:57,813 --> 00:26:01,895
I'm getting really upset. I'm very upset.

748
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,595
It was the cutest fight in the world.

749
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:07,080
- Stop it. I said stop it. - Don't brag.

750
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:08,250
(What could it be?)

751
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,905
Isn't it the size of their feet?

752
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:13,160
- Haha's feet are bigger than mine. - It's bigger than Jae Seok...

753
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:15,730
- but smaller than Haha. - What's your foot size?

754
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,630
- Mine is 270mm. - That must be it.

755
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:20,145
- Mine is 280mm. - It's the foot size.

756
00:26:20,302 --> 00:26:22,070
It must be 275mm.

757
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,285
(Is it 275, between 270 and 280?)

758
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:29,070
- What else is there? - Birthday.

759
00:26:29,077 --> 00:26:31,440
- Their birthday? - 0814.

760
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:33,140
- His is the 14th. - Mine is the 20th.

761
00:26:33,148 --> 00:26:35,810
- 814. - 815 and 822?

762
00:26:35,817 --> 00:26:38,280
- 820. - Mine is 814.

763
00:26:38,286 --> 00:26:40,135
- There's some difference. - It's 15.

764
00:26:40,288 --> 00:26:42,150
Don't you know his birthday by now?

765
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:44,590
- What I mean is... - When I call him...

766
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,620
and say, "I'm disappointed. Today is my birthday."

767
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:47,975
He says, "I'm sorry."

768
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:52,060
He says, "Why didn't you tell me before?"

769
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,575
- Even if it's tomorrow? - He'd definitely say that.

770
00:26:54,636 --> 00:26:56,470
- Right. - Is she leaving today?

771
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:57,900
- Really? - Yes.

772
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,400
- That's right. - Oh, no.

773
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,240
- That's sad. - Are you leaving?

774
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:04,040
We haven't seen you in a while. I'm sad.

775
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,440
If you're sad to see me leave, you'll invite me again.

776
00:27:06,448 --> 00:27:09,025
Please remember me.

777
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:12,920
- Do Yeon. - She's very busy these days.

778
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,120
- Right. - Thank you for coming.

779
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:16,750
- Thank you. - It was good to see you.

780
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,790
- Thank you, Do Yeon. - It was my pleasure.

781
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:20,205
Thank you.

782
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,130
What's this?

783
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:24,875
(It's lunchtime.)

784
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,600
It's bibimbap.

785
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:28,945
Fried eggs.

786
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:31,170
It's perfect with an egg.

787
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:32,385
(There's a raw egg instead.)

788
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:33,870
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

789
00:27:33,875 --> 00:27:37,140
- Your lunch is prepared. - It's bibimbap.

790
00:27:37,145 --> 00:27:41,280
We invited a special guest to have lunch with you.

791
00:27:41,283 --> 00:27:43,180
- Again? - We invited a special guest.

792
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:45,465
We have a guest for each section.

793
00:27:45,687 --> 00:27:47,795
- "Section guest"? - That sounds funny.

794
00:27:47,956 --> 00:27:50,620
- Who is it? - Won't it be a chef?

795
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:51,620
(Will it be a famous chef?)

796
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,520
Will it be Hong Yoon Hwa in disguise?

797
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:56,775
- Hong Yoon Hwa? - "How delicious will it be?"

798
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:59,860
(It's a special lunch guest.)

799
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:01,500
Goodness.

800
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:05,555
(Who is the guest for this section?)

801
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:09,140
(Chef Jang Do Yeon)

802
00:28:09,144 --> 00:28:10,685
Hello.

803
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:14,080
- It's Do Yeon. - We thought you left.

804
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:17,280
Hello, I'm someone else. I have a mole.

805
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,880
(I'm not Jang Do Yeon.)

806
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:21,365
(She's obviously someone else.)

807
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:24,750
She does have a mole. That's right.

808
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,205
Why did she get a mole?

809
00:28:26,628 --> 00:28:27,890
What are you doing?

810
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:29,660
It's the first time we meet, so I'll introduce myself.

811
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:32,630
I will be clearing the mission with you today.

812
00:28:32,634 --> 00:28:36,015
I'm Big Foot, not Big Mama.

813
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:37,530
(Chef Big Foot)

814
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,115
I'm Chef Jang Do Yeon.

815
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:40,800
What do you mean?

816
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:43,570
- I thought you left. - I thought you left.

817
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:44,870
- I know. - What do you mean?

818
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:46,880
- I should do as much as I can. - That's good.

819
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:49,295
- Yes. - That's good. I'm glad.

820
00:28:49,384 --> 00:28:51,280
For today's lunch,

821
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,780
we prepared bibimbap for you.

822
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:56,320
However, there's no fried egg in your bibimbap.

823
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,690
That's not a big deal.

824
00:28:57,692 --> 00:28:58,890
- It isn't, right? - Right.

825
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:00,335
(The essential part of bibimbap is missing.)

826
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,590
You must make your own fried egg.

827
00:29:02,597 --> 00:29:04,145
That's simple.

828
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:06,230
- Here's your mission. - What is it?

829
00:29:06,234 --> 00:29:07,475
This mission is...

830
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:08,870
(Their second mission)

831
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,130
Dangerous Egg Yolk.

832
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:13,270
(Goodness, Dangerous Egg Yolk)

833
00:29:13,274 --> 00:29:14,270
(She mimics him again.)

834
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:15,270
"Dangerous Egg Yolk"?

835
00:29:15,276 --> 00:29:16,825
(She mimics him again.)

836
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:18,880
- I like jokes like this. - No.

837
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,980
(Embarrassed)

838
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,195
Seriously?

839
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:25,435
- What do you mean? - The egg yolk can't be popped.

840
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,950
You're given 100 seconds.

841
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:29,690
- Use only your fork. - We can't grab it?

842
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,660
You can't touch the frying pan. Put the egg yolk...

843
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,330
over your bibimbap without popping it within 100 seconds.

844
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:37,575
(Success)

845
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:39,745
Six people must succeed?

846
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:40,960
Let's do it 1 by 1.

847
00:29:40,969 --> 00:29:42,430
- Shall Haha start? - Okay.

848
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:43,785
- Okay. - Okay.

849
00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:46,770
- Haha has lived alone. - Haha is good at cooking.

850
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,170
He's lived alone for a long time.

851
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:49,540
- Here we go. - Yes.

852
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:52,455
- In 2, 3. Start. - Start.

853
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:54,980
(The countdown starts.)

854
00:29:54,983 --> 00:29:56,825
Turn on the gas first.

855
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:59,150
(He's relaxed.)

856
00:29:59,154 --> 00:30:01,420
Put some oil first.

857
00:30:01,423 --> 00:30:02,850
- It takes time. - It needs to be heated.

858
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:04,950
100 seconds are not that short.

859
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:08,135
Haha, drop it close to the pan. That's right.

860
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:11,690
- He uses one hand. - Nice.

861
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:15,630
He's good. Look at that. It's perfect.

862
00:30:15,637 --> 00:30:17,370
(It's the level of the owner of a barbecue restaurant.)

863
00:30:17,372 --> 00:30:18,815
That's right.

864
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:20,870
He's like a chef.

865
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,240
Don't pop the egg yolk.

866
00:30:22,243 --> 00:30:25,380
That's how chefs cook.

867
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,980
(Being careful)

868
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:27,980
You have 30 seconds left.

869
00:30:27,982 --> 00:30:29,765
- Be careful. - That's all that remains?

870
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:32,665
- It's a short period of time. - He'll succeed if he makes it.

871
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:33,850
How many seconds are left?

872
00:30:33,855 --> 00:30:37,450
- 9, 8, 7... - Hurry up. Put it in.

873
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,175
- 6, 5... - Hurry.

874
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:41,720
(It's slippery.)

875
00:30:41,729 --> 00:30:43,760
- 4, 3... - Look at him.

876
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:44,790
(He places it inside the bowl.)

877
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,675
- He got it. - It isn't popped.

878
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:49,185
It isn't popped.

879
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:50,985
It isn't popped.

880
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:52,815
(Did it get placed safely inside the bowl?)

881
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:54,800
- It's leaking. - What do you mean?

882
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:56,410
It popped during the process.

883
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,640
- It did pop. - Gosh, that's unfortunate.

884
00:30:58,646 --> 00:31:00,255
(It completely popped.)

885
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,380
- It did pop. - Gosh, that's unfortunate.

886
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,380
(Haha fails.)

887
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:05,820
- Gosh, Haha. - You try it.

888
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,020
- I'm disappointed. - Try it.

889
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,650
I believe in you, Ji Hyo.

890
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:11,120
You should have made it.

891
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:13,405
If two more fail, we all fail.

892
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:14,620
Get ready.

893
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:15,690
Start.

894
00:31:15,697 --> 00:31:17,275
(The countdown starts.)

895
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:18,960
- Just crack it open right away. - Right away?

896
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,860
No, it gets stuck on the pan.

897
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,800
(She pours in a lot of oil.)

898
00:31:22,804 --> 00:31:24,400
- That's enough. - That's too much.

899
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:27,455
- It won't stick. - That's enough to deep-fry the egg.

900
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:29,970
- That's too much. - It doesn't matter how it tastes.

901
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:33,040
- Goodness. - I don't think she can do this.

902
00:31:33,047 --> 00:31:35,250
- Gosh. - That's not how to do it.

903
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:37,080
Make sure the egg yolk doesn't pop.

904
00:31:37,085 --> 00:31:38,550
Open it up.

905
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:41,420
- That's not how you do it. - Ji Hyo, what are you doing?

906
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:44,050
Put it lower!

907
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:46,460
- Put it lower. Open it up. - Open it up.

908
00:31:46,461 --> 00:31:48,260
(The egg white spills.)

909
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:51,105
(How does the egg yolk look?)

910
00:31:51,166 --> 00:31:52,460
It didn't pop.

911
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,460
(Miraculously, it didn't pop.)

912
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:56,030
- Keep it low. - Goodness.

913
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,030
(Despite her tactic, the egg yolk is safe.)

914
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,770
- That was scary. - The egg yolk came out...

915
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:01,485
like a baby.

916
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:03,885
That was close.

917
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:06,640
- All I have to do is transfer well. - You're running out of time.

918
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:07,980
You should make it small.

919
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:10,150
- I'll give it a try. - That's good.

920
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:11,880
- 10, 9... - You got it.

921
00:32:11,886 --> 00:32:13,950
- Do it slowly, Ji Hyo. - Do it slowly.

922
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,165
- Right. - Gosh.

923
00:32:15,957 --> 00:32:17,390
(It's not easy to move it with a fork.)

924
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:19,260
- Seven... - Lift it up.

925
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,790
- Six. - Lift up the bowl.

926
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:24,460
- No way. Seven. - Lift it up.

927
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:26,230
(She lifts it up carefully.)

928
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:29,545
- Okay. - She got it!

929
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:31,170
Okay.

930
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,555
(It's perfect.)

931
00:32:34,242 --> 00:32:36,525
- Okay. - That was hot.

932
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,140
(Ji Hyo succeeds with a perfect transfer.)

933
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:42,625
- She looked very awkward. - Ji Hyo.

934
00:32:42,784 --> 00:32:44,150
- I got it. - It was a success.

935
00:32:44,152 --> 00:32:46,035
(Ji Hyo is as good as always.)

936
00:32:46,154 --> 00:32:48,020
- Okay, I'll start. - It looks hard.

937
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,305
- All right. - Seok Jin.

938
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,590
It's his first time making a fried egg.

939
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:54,020
- I did it in the military. - Take a look.

940
00:32:54,028 --> 00:32:55,460
- Gosh. - He's a beginner.

941
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,130
- Yes. - Get ready.

942
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:58,345
Start.

943
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:00,245
It's on.

944
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:02,370
I've done it in the military.

945
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,885
(He'll make a perfect, fried egg based on his experience.)

946
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:06,670
- Oil. - Pour some oil.

947
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:07,885
Seok Jin, oil.

948
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,410
(Is he frying an egg without oil?)

949
00:33:11,412 --> 00:33:12,440
Seok Jin.

950
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:13,795
(Now, he pours some oil.)

951
00:33:13,815 --> 00:33:15,280
We have to take care of him.

952
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:18,795
If he was alone, he would've poured the oil after cracking the egg open.

953
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,120
(He cracks open an egg with one hand.)

954
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:23,550
- Okay. - He can't do it.

955
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:26,520
- Okay. - The pan should be heated.

956
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:29,560
- It's okay. It'll be cooked. - The pan should be heated.

957
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:31,075
It's starting to cook.

958
00:33:31,766 --> 00:33:33,030
I can hear the sound.

959
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:35,470
- No, Seok Jin. Oh, no. - Wait.

960
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,885
(What is he doing?)

961
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:39,540
(Pouring)

962
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,670
(Pouring a lot more)

963
00:33:40,675 --> 00:33:42,770
- What are you doing? - It's slippery.

964
00:33:42,777 --> 00:33:44,140
(Half of it is oil.)

965
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:46,240
The egg yolk is about to pop.

966
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,980
You shouldn't put oil on it.

967
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:50,180
- The egg yolk is about to pop. - What are you doing?

968
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,895
I'm covering it with oil.

969
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,850
He poured oil on the egg yolk.

970
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:55,050
The heat is getting low.

971
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:56,690
- It's not ready yet. - It's hot.

972
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,720
(Oil is splashing.)

973
00:33:57,725 --> 00:33:59,460
- Leave it alone. - It's okay.

974
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,490
(The oil splashes.)

975
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:02,475
It's like a volcanic eruption.

976
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:03,860
- 10. - Look at the oil.

977
00:34:03,865 --> 00:34:05,860
- You have to transfer it. - There's too much oil.

978
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:07,900
- It's hot. - It's too much oil.

979
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,985
- 9, 8... - You have to transfer it now.

980
00:34:10,238 --> 00:34:12,870
- Be careful, Seok Jin. - Put it in the bowl.

981
00:34:12,874 --> 00:34:14,655
- Get the other side. - It's separating.

982
00:34:14,942 --> 00:34:16,070
Do it.

983
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:18,240
- Let it go. - Don't do it that way. Let it go.

984
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:19,680
Just drop it.

985
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,480
(The egg yolk loses its shape.)

986
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:24,680
- What are you doing? - Goodness.

987
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:28,320
Everyone, express your condolences. The egg yolk has passed away.

988
00:34:28,323 --> 00:34:31,165
(Everyone, express your condolences. The egg yolk has passed away.)

989
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,905
Egg yolks are things that we eat.

990
00:34:33,961 --> 00:34:35,590
Why did you destroy the egg yolk?

991
00:34:35,596 --> 00:34:36,860
(You were a great egg yolk.)

992
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:37,860
(Egg Yolk, 2018 to 2018)

993
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:40,560
- How could he? - I'm sorry.

994
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:42,075
You're so mean.

995
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:44,070
Please succeed.

996
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,370
You can do it. I mean it.

997
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:48,810
- Chef Yu, show us. - Show us.

998
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,385
I'll show you guys.

999
00:34:50,778 --> 00:34:53,280
I'll show you how beautiful...

1000
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,850
- a fried egg can be. - Good luck.

1001
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,010
Chefs don't break eggs on edges.

1002
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,380
They use the surface.

1003
00:34:59,387 --> 00:35:00,620
That's what I do.

1004
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:01,865
Why would you do that?

1005
00:35:01,889 --> 00:35:03,650
- Why would you do that? - I just do that.

1006
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,620
Aren't you just pretentious?

1007
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:06,920
I think you're just pretentious.

1008
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:08,320
- I'll show you. - He's definitely pretentious.

1009
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:09,605
Ready.

1010
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,375
(Good luck, Pretentious Chef.)

1011
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,230
(He's given 100 seconds.)

1012
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:14,400
It's important to remain calm.

1013
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:15,430
He's so calm.

1014
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:18,270
(He checks the temperature relaxedly.)

1015
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:21,700
- He looks like an expert. - When you fry eggs,

1016
00:35:21,709 --> 00:35:23,710
you shouldn't fuss.

1017
00:35:23,711 --> 00:35:25,980
Hurry up.

1018
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,040
- Don't worry. - Hurry.

1019
00:35:28,049 --> 00:35:30,210
He's talking too much. I'm getting worried.

1020
00:35:30,218 --> 00:35:31,910
He usually fails when he does this.

1021
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:33,020
(Pouring)

1022
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,195
He's even bad at pouring oil.

1023
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,150
It looks so bad.

1024
00:35:37,158 --> 00:35:38,860
- Even the oil looks ugly. - Don't worry.

1025
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,190
- You don't have much time. - It doesn't look natural.

1026
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:42,690
You have less time than you think.

1027
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:44,005
(Breaking)

1028
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,200
The yolk broke.

1029
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:49,445
(What is this?)

1030
00:35:50,104 --> 00:35:53,040
(As soon as he drops the yolk,)

1031
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
(it breaks.)

1032
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,010
It's already broken.

1033
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,710
What is this?

1034
00:35:58,713 --> 00:35:59,980
Your thumb...

1035
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:02,150
- Why did you poke it? - Why did you break it?

1036
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,350
I'm sorry.

1037
00:36:03,351 --> 00:36:05,110
He's so bad.

1038
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,620
- He poked it with his thumb. - Why did you break it?

1039
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:10,120
Can I try again? Chef Big Foot.

1040
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,690
Offer your condolences.

1041
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:13,560
(Rest in peace.)

1042
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,235
Where did you put your thumb?

1043
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:16,630
I'm sorry.

1044
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:18,090
Your thumb...

1045
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:19,300
I'm sorry.

1046
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,100
Turn off the stove. You might get burned.

1047
00:36:21,102 --> 00:36:23,000
Gosh. What a shame.

1048
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:24,230
We should use the chance card.

1049
00:36:24,238 --> 00:36:27,115
- We should. - But if we use it...

1050
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:29,110
and Jong Kook fails,

1051
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,670
- it'll be over, right? - It'll be over.

1052
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:32,940
Let's use it a bit later. Let me try first.

1053
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,010
Okay.

1054
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:35,040
Try first.

1055
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:36,450
I think he'll do a good job.

1056
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:38,550
He's eaten...

1057
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:40,780
about two chicken farms' worth of eggs so far.

1058
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:42,050
He's eaten even more.

1059
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:43,390
(He has contributed to the poultry industry.)

1060
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,750
- Should I start? - He's the chickens' worst enemy.

1061
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,290
Let's go.

1062
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:48,460
(Since he's eaten so many eggs, he'll probably be good.)

1063
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:50,605
Thank you.

1064
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:52,360
Start. Let me start.

1065
00:36:52,366 --> 00:36:53,875
(He's given 100 seconds.)

1066
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:56,030
(He can't control his strength.)

1067
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:57,370
(He is overzealous.)

1068
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:58,940
- He's too strong. - He's too strong.

1069
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,455
Can't you control your strength?

1070
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:03,840
You don't need a lot of oil.

1071
00:37:03,845 --> 00:37:04,970
But I need at least this much.

1072
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:08,210
You need more. Otherwise, the egg can burn.

1073
00:37:08,216 --> 00:37:09,750
Don't be so stingy.

1074
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,050
- Don't try to save the oil. - What do you mean?

1075
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:12,580
I'm not.

1076
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:14,295
With one hand.

1077
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:15,965
Like this.

1078
00:37:16,224 --> 00:37:17,835
This is how you do it.

1079
00:37:18,426 --> 00:37:20,060
(The egg lover can control eggs very well.)

1080
00:37:20,061 --> 00:37:21,905
- The yolk is right in the middle. - Yes.

1081
00:37:22,063 --> 00:37:23,560
(Impressed)

1082
00:37:23,564 --> 00:37:25,005
That looks perfect.

1083
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,500
It looks beautiful.

1084
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,485
- It's going well. - Then after that...

1085
00:37:29,971 --> 00:37:32,570
Gosh, it's about to burst.

1086
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:33,900
(It's about to explode.)

1087
00:37:33,908 --> 00:37:35,870
The yolk is about to explode.

1088
00:37:35,877 --> 00:37:37,740
- The yolk is boiling. - Hey.

1089
00:37:37,745 --> 00:37:38,880
It's boiling.

1090
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,110
- Transfer it now. - No.

1091
00:37:40,114 --> 00:37:41,280
There are 10 seconds left.

1092
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:42,550
- 10 seconds? - You should transfer it.

1093
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,680
Go.

1094
00:37:43,684 --> 00:37:44,710
(Transfer it into the bowl.)

1095
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,135
You have to do it now.

1096
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:48,320
Go.

1097
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:51,050
(Will he be able to save the yolk?)

1098
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:52,575
- It's about to burst. - Oh, my.

1099
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:55,075
(It's lifted.)

1100
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:56,560
The egg white is protecting the yolk.

1101
00:37:56,564 --> 00:38:00,200
(If Jong Kook fails, their mission fails altogether.)

1102
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:02,030
- There you go. - The egg white is protecting it.

1103
00:38:02,036 --> 00:38:03,370
(It safely lands in the bowl.)

1104
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:04,630
- There you go. - Oh, my.

1105
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,000
We don't know yet.

1106
00:38:06,007 --> 00:38:08,240
- Please take a look. - Okay.

1107
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,440
Don't touch it. Put the camera...

1108
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:12,025
- inside. - Save it.

1109
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:13,180
It didn't burst.

1110
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,610
(Is the yolk safe?)

1111
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:15,925
You brat.

1112
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:19,320
Is it bleeding?

1113
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,465
- It didn't break, did it? - You brat.

1114
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:26,760
(The side is bleeding.)

1115
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:28,005
It's bleeding?

1116
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:29,905
There's a crack on the side.

1117
00:38:30,164 --> 00:38:31,730
The ribs are cracked.

1118
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:34,330
- It's bleeding. - He almost succeeded.

1119
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:36,845
- We'll use Do Yeon Chance Card. - We'll use Do Yeon Chance Card.

1120
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,770
That's too bad.

1121
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:39,800
It broke?

1122
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:41,185
- Yes. - It broke?

1123
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:42,810
He was almost done.

1124
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,940
Give him another chance.

1125
00:38:43,945 --> 00:38:45,925
Since it was so close,

1126
00:38:46,347 --> 00:38:48,625
if you put one name on the roulette,

1127
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,365
we'll reduce the number of successes you need by one.

1128
00:38:51,852 --> 00:38:53,150
- Okay. - Jae Seok.

1129
00:38:53,154 --> 00:38:55,990
(Okay. We choose Jae Seok.)

1130
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,390
He must know why.

1131
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,160
- I'm sure he knows. - Hey.

1132
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,360
He was the only one who failed even before starting cooking.

1133
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:03,890
I vote for Jae Seok too.

1134
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,700
- It's not okay. - Then...

1135
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,500
let's choose from those who failed.

1136
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,330
- From those who failed. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1137
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1138
00:39:11,005 --> 00:39:12,640
- Okay. Only those who failed. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1139
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,870
- I succeeded. - Okay.

1140
00:39:13,874 --> 00:39:15,000
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1141
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:16,170
(They're deciding whose name to sacrifice.)

1142
00:39:16,177 --> 00:39:17,240
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1143
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:18,870
(Haha loses.)

1144
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,195
Okay.

1145
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:21,410
Haha.

1146
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:23,950
(Haha's name goes on the wheel.)

1147
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:25,510
It's a deal.

1148
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,235
Haha's name will go on the wheel.

1149
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,905
We reduced the number by 1. 2 have failed so far.

1150
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:31,835
- Let me go first. - Okay.

1151
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:35,190
Since Kwang Soo lives alone, he might succeed.

1152
00:39:35,196 --> 00:39:37,105
Fried eggs...

1153
00:39:37,231 --> 00:39:38,690
- You've never made it? - I'm good at making them.

1154
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:40,000
Kwang Soo...

1155
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:42,100
His ex-girlfriend...

1156
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:45,070
- loved fried eggs. - I see.

1157
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:47,070
(Kwang Soo's ex-girlfriend loved fried eggs.)

1158
00:39:47,074 --> 00:39:48,240
(What?)

1159
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:50,755
Why do you bring her up now?

1160
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:55,625
(Lee Kwang Soo and Fried Eggs, the Secret Relationship)

1161
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,895
Okay.

1162
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,295
You have 100 seconds.

1163
00:39:58,986 --> 00:40:00,250
- Is that okay? - It's okay.

1164
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:01,695
Why are you doing this to me?

1165
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,390
What's with you?

1166
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:04,950
Fold the white.

1167
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:06,835
Pour some more oil.

1168
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:08,960
- Hey! - It didn't break.

1169
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:10,490
(It started interestingly, but Kwang Soo fails.)

1170
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,830
We'll write one more name.

1171
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:14,115
It's your last chance. If you write one more name,

1172
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,215
we'll reduce the number of successes you need by one.

1173
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:19,300
- We'll write another name. - Kwang Soo.

1174
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:22,470
The rest of you should play Race of Wits.

1175
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:23,810
Race of Wits?

1176
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:25,640
We haven't done anything yet.

1177
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:28,040
- We haven't even played the game. - Race of Wits?

1178
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:29,950
We played rock-paper-scissors.

1179
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,610
The rest should...

1180
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,350
- play Race of Wits. - I played rock-paper-scissors too.

1181
00:40:33,354 --> 00:40:36,050
- You did? - I can't believe you.

1182
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:37,950
You want me to burst you with my thumb?

1183
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:40,820
(Like your egg)

1184
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:41,820
What?

1185
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,490
You want to end up like your egg?

1186
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:46,630
- Even his cap is yellow. - You want me to burst you?

1187
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:47,830
- From his head. - Should I push you?

1188
00:40:47,835 --> 00:40:49,230
(He might end up like an egg.)

1189
00:40:49,236 --> 00:40:51,000
- You played before? I'm sorry. - Gosh.

1190
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:52,700
- Try to remember things. - I'm sorry.

1191
00:40:52,707 --> 00:40:53,740
We played together.

1192
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,710
Ji Hyo, you should play it too. That's the right way. I'm right.

1193
00:40:56,711 --> 00:40:57,940
My judgment is accurate.

1194
00:40:57,945 --> 00:40:59,380
- That's what old people say. - I'm right.

1195
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,940
They say, "I'm right."

1196
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:03,180
(I succeeded, so why do I have to play?)

1197
00:41:03,184 --> 00:41:04,610
- Right? - Gosh.

1198
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:05,920
- I'm right. - Why?

1199
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,350
Ask hundreds of thousands of people on the street.

1200
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:09,665
Hundreds of thousands?

1201
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:11,490
It'd take too long.

1202
00:41:11,492 --> 00:41:12,875
Listen carefully.

1203
00:41:13,027 --> 00:41:15,060
- Ji Hyo... - The four of you should play.

1204
00:41:15,062 --> 00:41:16,930
Although Ji Hyo succeeded...

1205
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:20,530
- If we fail... - She shouldn't play.

1206
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:22,400
(Jae Seok cuts in.)

1207
00:41:22,403 --> 00:41:23,830
Just write your name.

1208
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:25,000
Stop talking!

1209
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:28,040
(Jong Kook explodes.)

1210
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:29,585
I was talking.

1211
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:31,355
Gosh.

1212
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:33,355
Let me finish.

1213
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,350
- Stop talking. - Goodness.

1214
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,825
I feel so uncomfortable.

1215
00:41:38,419 --> 00:41:40,680
- Let me go home. - We do this every week.

1216
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:41,680
I feel so uncomfortable.

1217
00:41:41,689 --> 00:41:43,490
Okay. Let's do it.

1218
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,590
- The four of us? - He wants to do it.

1219
00:41:44,592 --> 00:41:46,290
- Race of Wits? - The four of them.

1220
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:48,105
Race of Wits. Ready.

1221
00:41:49,363 --> 00:41:51,190
- You should sit down. - I'm going to succeed.

1222
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:52,430
- Ready. - Hold on.

1223
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:53,800
We can't play like this.

1224
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:54,900
- What? - We're supposed to sit down.

1225
00:41:54,902 --> 00:41:56,530
What's wrong?

1226
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:57,830
We have to sit down.

1227
00:41:57,838 --> 00:41:59,440
- Really? - Ready.

1228
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,570
- Ready. - Start.

1229
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:02,740
- 1. - 1.

1230
00:42:02,743 --> 00:42:04,770
(Seok Jin said, "1".)

1231
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:06,155
Wait, what?

1232
00:42:06,313 --> 00:42:09,450
(Where is my chair? I did sit down.)

1233
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,765
Guys.

1234
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:12,525
Wait, what?

1235
00:42:14,855 --> 00:42:16,350
(Pathetic)

1236
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:17,735
Who took my chair?

1237
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:19,120
Who took it?

1238
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,160
(No one did.)

1239
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:21,190
We have to play rock-paper-scissors.

1240
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,560
- Seok Jin and Jong Kook. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1241
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:23,630
Okay. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1242
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,460
(As Seok Jin and Jong Kook lost, they play rock-paper-scissors.)

1243
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:26,660
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1244
00:42:26,667 --> 00:42:27,930
(Jong Kook loses.)

1245
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,600
- I win. - I wanted to tell you.

1246
00:42:29,603 --> 00:42:30,830
All right.

1247
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:31,830
I wanted to tell you.

1248
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,655
- Are we writing Jong Kook's name? - Yes.

1249
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:37,510
(Kim Jong Kook)

1250
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,440
- Who is going to try? - So Min and I.

1251
00:42:39,446 --> 00:42:40,825
Okay.

1252
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:42,495
Give me an egg.

1253
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,965
- I just need to save the yolk. - That's right.

1254
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,320
She succeeded.

1255
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:50,220
(So Min succeeds by removing the white.)

1256
00:42:50,224 --> 00:42:52,905
It's so round.

1257
00:42:53,427 --> 00:42:54,560
It looks very stable.

1258
00:42:54,562 --> 00:42:58,075
(Se Chan succeeds perfectly.)

1259
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:01,415
We're using Do Yeon Chance Card.

1260
00:43:01,435 --> 00:43:03,215
If we fail this time, it's over, right?

1261
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:05,545
Yes. And you get flicked on the forehead too.

1262
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:07,355
- Oh, right. - Right.

1263
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:09,155
- That's right. - That's right.

1264
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:11,655
- Let's do this, Do Yeon. - You can do this.

1265
00:43:12,246 --> 00:43:14,025
You use this to fry eggs?

1266
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:16,150
- Yes. - Really?

1267
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,380
Let's do this.

1268
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:19,880
- She used the surface. - It's the chefs' style.

1269
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,595
(The yolk drops smoothly.)

1270
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:24,750
- Nice. - Good.

1271
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,960
- It was incredible. - Look at this.

1272
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:29,060
(She makes a "V" sign.)

1273
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:30,190
Good job.

1274
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:31,975
I think she'll succeed.

1275
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,630
But around the yolk...

1276
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:35,730
- It's bubbling. - It...

1277
00:43:35,736 --> 00:43:38,530
- It's boiling. - The white is broken.

1278
00:43:38,539 --> 00:43:41,170
- 10 seconds. - Cut it away.

1279
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,400
- Should I cut it? - 10.

1280
00:43:42,409 --> 00:43:43,810
- You have to transfer it now. - Nine.

1281
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:47,180
(The yolk is about to burst, but she has to transfer it.)

1282
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:49,410
- Slowly. - Put it deeper.

1283
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,610
(The mission relies on Chef Big Foot.)

1284
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,820
- Slowly. - You have to transfer it.

1285
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,895
- Turn it. - You have to go.

1286
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:57,090
If we fail this time, it's over, right?

1287
00:43:57,091 --> 00:43:58,220
I think she'll succeed.

1288
00:43:58,225 --> 00:44:00,190
(Will Chef Big Foot pull it off?)

1289
00:44:00,194 --> 00:44:01,220
Lift it!

1290
00:44:01,228 --> 00:44:03,645
(Moving)

1291
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:08,530
(She lifted it well, but the yolk breaks.)

1292
00:44:08,535 --> 00:44:10,645
We'll write Do Yeon's name.

1293
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:14,170
But don't forget to turn off the stove.

1294
00:44:14,174 --> 00:44:15,370
(Turn off the stove even if your mission fails.)

1295
00:44:15,376 --> 00:44:17,155
What's that?

1296
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:19,240
(I'm sorry, guys.)

1297
00:44:19,246 --> 00:44:21,440
Your mission failed.

1298
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:23,525
You'll receive a hint,

1299
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:26,050
but you have to write two more names.

1300
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:27,620
Let's choose someone who isn't on the wheel yet.

1301
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:28,720
- Okay. - Okay.

1302
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:30,990
Then the two of you are excluded.

1303
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:34,190
The remaining 6 will play Race of Wits while the 2 sit.

1304
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:36,830
You're deciding which two will write their names on the wheel...

1305
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:39,560
and which one will be flicked on the forehead by Do Yeon.

1306
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:41,160
The person will have two penalties.

1307
00:44:41,168 --> 00:44:42,360
One person gets it all.

1308
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:43,870
Start.

1309
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:45,000
- 1. - 2.

1310
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:46,240
(Race of Wits starts.)

1311
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
- 3. - 4.

1312
00:44:47,241 --> 00:44:48,340
- Five. - Okay.

1313
00:44:48,342 --> 00:44:50,125
(Kwang Soo is selected.)

1314
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:54,095
(Wait, is it me?)

1315
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:57,110
Why are you pretending to be calm?

1316
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:58,910
Kwang Soo was being too careful.

1317
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,135
One more person?

1318
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:02,080
- Kwang Soo gets it all. - Right.

1319
00:45:02,089 --> 00:45:03,320
He gets a flick on his head.

1320
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:04,620
- There should be 2 names. - There should be 2 names.

1321
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:06,190
Two? That's right.

1322
00:45:06,193 --> 00:45:07,660
Shall I pick one person?

1323
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:08,690
(Pick a person?)

1324
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:09,690
That's good.

1325
00:45:09,697 --> 00:45:11,530
What do you think about that?

1326
00:45:11,532 --> 00:45:12,590
- That's good. - It sounds good.

1327
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:13,700
- What do you think? - I agree.

1328
00:45:13,701 --> 00:45:14,915
I agree.

1329
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,515
What do you think?

1330
00:45:17,404 --> 00:45:20,340
I asked what you think. What do you think?

1331
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:23,140
Three people agreed with my picking another member.

1332
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,810
Three votes. What do you think?

1333
00:45:24,812 --> 00:45:25,910
- Kwang Soo. - What do you think?

1334
00:45:25,913 --> 00:45:26,910
- I agree. - You agree?

1335
00:45:26,914 --> 00:45:27,940
- What should I do? - Kwang Soo.

1336
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:29,480
- I agree. - Everyone agrees.

1337
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:30,710
Listen.

1338
00:45:30,718 --> 00:45:31,980
I'll do this.

1339
00:45:31,986 --> 00:45:34,135
Jae Seok and I will play rock-paper-scissors.

1340
00:45:34,555 --> 00:45:36,320
If I lose,

1341
00:45:36,323 --> 00:45:38,550
my name will be attached twice, and I'll get the forehead flick.

1342
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:39,820
- Really? - Yes.

1343
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:41,290
If you lose,

1344
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:43,090
your name will be attached twice, and you'll get the forehead flick.

1345
00:45:43,097 --> 00:45:44,360
That's great.

1346
00:45:44,365 --> 00:45:46,360
Gosh, Kwang Soo knows how to fight.

1347
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,430
This is good.

1348
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:48,700
Kwang Soo gets competitive.

1349
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,745
- One person takes it all. - That sounds good.

1350
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:52,840
What if I don't play?

1351
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,470
You'll seem like a coward.

1352
00:45:55,476 --> 00:45:57,210
- Pathetic? - You'll be a coward.

1353
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,370
Pardon?

1354
00:45:58,379 --> 00:45:59,640
You're a tiger moth.

1355
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:01,310
Jae Seok won't refuse.

1356
00:46:01,315 --> 00:46:02,910
(Jae Seok wouldn't refuse this.)

1357
00:46:02,916 --> 00:46:04,880
- Will I be pathetic? - You'll be a pathetic coward.

1358
00:46:04,885 --> 00:46:05,880
Okay.

1359
00:46:05,886 --> 00:46:06,980
I'll be one.

1360
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:08,680
(He agrees to be a coward.)

1361
00:46:08,689 --> 00:46:11,220
(He refuses to fight.)

1362
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:12,990
- What? - Are you a coward?

1363
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:14,675
Will you be pathetic?

1364
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:16,160
(What's wrong with being a pathetic coward?)

1365
00:46:16,163 --> 00:46:17,930
- Will you be pathetic? - A coward.

1366
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,560
I'll be a pathetic coward.

1367
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:21,430
- That's what I will be. - Put his name on.

1368
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:24,270
- I'll only put my name on. - Kwang Soo will get a flick.

1369
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,540
- Jae Seok is quite wise. - Yes.

1370
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,600
- He isn't reckless. - He isn't.

1371
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,810
Kwang Soo's name will be attached and get a flick on his forehead.

1372
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:32,840
Let's do this.

1373
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:34,740
Let's play a simple game.

1374
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,525
If you win,

1375
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,780
I'll get the forehead flick, and my name will be attached twice.

1376
00:46:38,786 --> 00:46:40,120
I'll take all the punishment.

1377
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,780
What else?

1378
00:46:41,789 --> 00:46:43,390
What if you win?

1379
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:45,990
If I win, Jae Seok gets the flick, and his name will be attached.

1380
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,205
I'll put my name too.

1381
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:49,290
If he wins, you take all the punishment?

1382
00:46:49,296 --> 00:46:50,505
(If he wins, he'll put his name once.)

1383
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:51,990
That's strange.

1384
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:53,030
(In that case...)

1385
00:46:53,033 --> 00:46:54,030
I won't do it.

1386
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:57,000
(He rejects his second proposal.)

1387
00:46:57,004 --> 00:46:58,700
In that case...

1388
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:00,540
- Be more extreme. - Okay.

1389
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:02,400
Propose me something more extreme.

1390
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:03,870
- Then... - How about this?

1391
00:47:03,877 --> 00:47:05,355
If you win,

1392
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:07,355
I'll take all the punishment.

1393
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,780
- One flick on your forehead? - Yes.

1394
00:47:09,783 --> 00:47:10,910
Your name will be attached twice.

1395
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:11,980
- What if you win? - This is important.

1396
00:47:11,985 --> 00:47:13,180
What if I lose?

1397
00:47:13,187 --> 00:47:15,595
You can flick my forehead.

1398
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:16,790
- What? - That's not bad.

1399
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,165
- What if I lose? - That's more important.

1400
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:20,790
What would you like to do?

1401
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:22,490
- Don't get a flick. - Put your name on.

1402
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:23,530
Okay.

1403
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,030
- Put your name once. - Put your name once.

1404
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:26,030
Just once.

1405
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:27,975
- He doesn't get a flick? - You take it all.

1406
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,430
If not, he has no reason to accept it.

1407
00:47:30,437 --> 00:47:32,000
- Let's do that. - Do what?

1408
00:47:32,005 --> 00:47:33,855
I get flicked on my forehead.

1409
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:36,370
What are you trying to do?

1410
00:47:36,376 --> 00:47:39,510
- I don't know. - You can pick a person.

1411
00:47:39,513 --> 00:47:42,580
- Wait a minute. - Will it ever end?

1412
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,210
It's the same as picking a person.

1413
00:47:44,218 --> 00:47:45,710
What would be more advantageous?

1414
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:47,350
How can I survive?

1415
00:47:47,354 --> 00:47:50,020
Each of your names will be attached, right?

1416
00:47:50,023 --> 00:47:52,020
If he wins, your name will be attached twice.

1417
00:47:52,025 --> 00:47:55,020
Is that what you're proposing?

1418
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:57,060
Will you also participate?

1419
00:47:57,064 --> 00:47:59,060
I'm just a spectator.

1420
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:00,660
I'll play if Seok Jin plays.

1421
00:48:00,667 --> 00:48:01,960
- Why would I play? - Play with us.

1422
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:03,870
If not, pick Seok Jin.

1423
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:04,930
- Seok Jin. - Why me?

1424
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:06,500
If he won't play, pick Seok Jin.

1425
00:48:06,507 --> 00:48:08,040
What will the spectator do?

1426
00:48:08,041 --> 00:48:09,710
I'll make it short.

1427
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:10,840
Will you play or not?

1428
00:48:10,844 --> 00:48:13,810
(He really makes it short.)

1429
00:48:13,814 --> 00:48:16,110
- If the spectator... - If he plays,

1430
00:48:16,116 --> 00:48:17,380
- I'll select him. - Okay.

1431
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:21,020
Seok Jin, if you refuse this offer, you're done for.

1432
00:48:21,021 --> 00:48:23,590
(What do you mean?)

1433
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:25,150
Otherwise, you're done. You must do it.

1434
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:26,720
- Do you surrender? - Wait.

1435
00:48:26,727 --> 00:48:28,920
- Why are you doing this to me? - If not, you'll be punished.

1436
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,260
- You must play. - You have to.

1437
00:48:30,264 --> 00:48:31,860
- I'll pick you. - I'll play.

1438
00:48:31,865 --> 00:48:33,115
Okay.

1439
00:48:33,233 --> 00:48:34,460
Okay, that's good.

1440
00:48:34,468 --> 00:48:37,870
If Kwang Soo loses,

1441
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:40,070
he gets a flick, and his name is attached twice, right?

1442
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:42,170
If Kwang Soo wins,

1443
00:48:42,176 --> 00:48:43,770
he gets a flick on the forehead, but both names will be attached.

1444
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:45,440
- That's right. - Okay.

1445
00:48:45,445 --> 00:48:46,810
- It's clear, right? - Yes.

1446
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:47,810
It's clear.

1447
00:48:47,814 --> 00:48:49,980
What about throwing a die?

1448
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:53,750
It turns out that all of them are unlucky.

1449
00:48:53,754 --> 00:48:55,350
- All right. - You have no complaints, right?

1450
00:48:55,355 --> 00:48:57,120
I must win no matter what.

1451
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:58,990
- Yes. - My name will be attached anyway.

1452
00:48:58,992 --> 00:49:00,020
Good luck.

1453
00:49:00,027 --> 00:49:01,190
You can do it, Jae Seok.

1454
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:02,620
- Okay. - It must be high.

1455
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:03,890
- Higher number wins. - Yes.

1456
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:05,030
It must be high.

1457
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:06,715
The higher number wins.

1458
00:49:06,733 --> 00:49:08,030
Throw one.

1459
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:13,415
(The higher the number, the more advantageous Kwang Soo gets.)

1460
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:16,670
(Kwang Soo isn't good at missions. How will it turn out?)

1461
00:49:16,677 --> 00:49:17,740
Okay.

1462
00:49:17,744 --> 00:49:19,580
(He throws 5.)

1463
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,140
(He has hope.)

1464
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:23,610
You should say, "start".

1465
00:49:23,617 --> 00:49:25,495
- You didn't say, "start". - He didn't.

1466
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:28,020
- That's right. - Wait.

1467
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:29,350
- That won't work. - Why didn't you say, "start"?

1468
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:30,750
- It's an official game. - That's right.

1469
00:49:30,757 --> 00:49:32,150
You should have said it.

1470
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,960
Isn't this an official game?

1471
00:49:34,962 --> 00:49:36,630
- It's necessary for official games. - Kwang Soo.

1472
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,460
Even the viewers recognized that you didn't say it.

1473
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:40,530
That's right.

1474
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:41,960
(Is this an official game?)

1475
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:44,085
- You must say, "start". - I'm sorry.

1476
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,455
- Say, "start". - Start.

1477
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:50,070
(This is Running Man's annual campaign.)

1478
00:49:50,077 --> 00:49:53,195
(Remember to say, "start" before starting official games.)

1479
00:49:53,213 --> 00:49:54,680
- Start. - That's good.

1480
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:55,840
This is for real.

1481
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:58,210
This is an official throw of a die.

1482
00:49:58,218 --> 00:50:00,350
(When did it become an official game?)

1483
00:50:00,354 --> 00:50:03,750
(This is more competitive and important than the yolk game.)

1484
00:50:03,757 --> 00:50:06,490
(What will his number be?)

1485
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:07,760
- Two. - Okay.

1486
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:09,075
(It's a small number.)

1487
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:11,030
It got worse.

1488
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:13,445
That was very clean.

1489
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:16,060
It's two for Lee Kwang Soo.

1490
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:17,370
Right.

1491
00:50:17,371 --> 00:50:18,500
Did you hear that?

1492
00:50:18,505 --> 00:50:20,600
(How dare you?)

1493
00:50:20,607 --> 00:50:23,070
- If Jae Seok throws one, - Okay!

1494
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:24,440
he's really unlucky.

1495
00:50:24,444 --> 00:50:26,755
- Start. - Okay.

1496
00:50:27,514 --> 00:50:29,850
(He hopes for anything but one.)

1497
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:33,120
(Kwang Soo hopes that he throws 1.)

1498
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:38,050
(Whose side will the die take?)

1499
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:39,090
Six.

1500
00:50:39,092 --> 00:50:41,705
(It's amazing. It's 6.)

1501
00:50:42,062 --> 00:50:47,115
(Compared to Kwang Soo, Jae Seok is quite lucky.)

1502
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:52,200
- Give me one more chance. - Suddenly?

1503
00:50:52,205 --> 00:50:53,670
I got six anyway.

1504
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:54,770
He got six.

1505
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,140
How about this?

1506
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:59,010
If I lose, I'll get flicked twice.

1507
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:00,695
(He accepts the offer.)

1508
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,840
If I win, your name will be attached once.

1509
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:04,150
- That sounds good. - Just one.

1510
00:51:04,151 --> 00:51:05,380
(If Kwang Soo wins, his name is attached once.)

1511
00:51:05,385 --> 00:51:06,650
Let's start.

1512
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:07,895
Start.

1513
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:09,580
His eyes got wide.

1514
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:13,375
(A small bet became very serious.)

1515
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:15,620
(Will their names be attached?)

1516
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:19,090
(Or will Kwang Soo get flicked twice?)

1517
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,045
- Five. - Okay.

1518
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:23,230
(Okay, it's 5.)

1519
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:24,870
If I win, your names will be attached.

1520
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,485
I won't play anymore.

1521
00:51:26,707 --> 00:51:28,355
Start. I almost didn't say it.

1522
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:32,410
(Will Jae Seok throw 6 twice in a row?)

1523
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:36,480
(If Jae Seok throws 6, Kwang Soo takes all the punishment.)

1524
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:41,435
(If it's lower than 5, Jae Seok and Seok Jin's names are attached.)

1525
00:51:42,155 --> 00:51:44,565
(Goodness, it's 6.)

1526
00:51:45,092 --> 00:51:47,220
(He throws six twice in a row.)

1527
00:51:47,227 --> 00:51:48,735
Jae Seok.

1528
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:52,360
(Kwang Soo makes his opponents lucky.)

1529
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:53,930
- Jae Seok. - No way.

1530
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,275
This is unbelievable.

1531
00:51:55,302 --> 00:51:57,145
- It's unbelievable. - It's unbelievable.

1532
00:51:57,404 --> 00:51:58,770
(Should I go home?)

1533
00:51:58,772 --> 00:52:00,255
My goodness.

1534
00:52:00,941 --> 00:52:04,925
Between 1 and 6...

1535
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:06,440
- It will be his name tags. - So...

1536
00:52:06,446 --> 00:52:08,855
His name is attached twice, and he gets flicked twice.

1537
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:12,050
Put your name twice.

1538
00:52:12,052 --> 00:52:13,780
I'll flick his forehead later.

1539
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:16,250
(I'll flick Kwang Soo's forehead later.)

1540
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:17,820
- When will you do it? - Later.

1541
00:52:17,824 --> 00:52:20,160
- When you want to? - Yes.

1542
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,275
Have a seat. I'll flick your forehead later.

1543
00:52:23,797 --> 00:52:25,990
- How did I throw six? - I know.

1544
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:28,900
(Current roulette status)

1545
00:52:28,902 --> 00:52:31,130
I'll be leaving now.

1546
00:52:31,138 --> 00:52:32,330
- Are you really leaving? - Do Yeon.

1547
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,240
- See you in Part Two. - You'll be back anyway.

1548
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:35,640
Will you be back later?

1549
00:52:35,642 --> 00:52:37,070
I'm leaving. I'm busy.

1550
00:52:37,077 --> 00:52:38,370
- Really? - I'm leaving.

1551
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:39,510
- See you. - Bye.

1552
00:52:39,513 --> 00:52:41,280
- Enjoy your food. - See you, Do Yeon.

1553
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:42,755
(We thank Jang Do Yeon for joining us.)

1554
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:45,550
- You didn't give us a hint. - That's right.

1555
00:52:45,552 --> 00:52:46,550
(It's the second hint.)

1556
00:52:46,553 --> 00:52:48,520
"It's bigger than Jae Seok but smaller than Haha."

1557
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:49,550
- What is it? - What's that?

1558
00:52:49,556 --> 00:52:50,835
- Two. - What is it?

1559
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:52,350
- Is it someone's hand? - It's right.

1560
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:53,760
The 1st is 2.

1561
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,960
What could this mean?

1562
00:52:54,961 --> 00:52:56,305
(What is this?)

1563
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:57,845
It's the foot size.

1564
00:52:57,931 --> 00:53:01,745
- It's 200... - 275mm?

1565
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:03,930
It could be 275 or 276.

1566
00:53:03,937 --> 00:53:06,770
That's not how shoe size is measured.

1567
00:53:06,773 --> 00:53:08,770
It's by 5mm.

1568
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:10,540
Okay, it has something to do with two.

1569
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:12,170
Next game is called...

1570
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:14,340
Nationwide Zero Human.

1571
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:15,855
(Nationwide Zero Human)

1572
00:53:16,416 --> 00:53:17,765
- What is that? - "Nationwide"?

1573
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:18,910
"Zero"?

1574
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:21,780
There's a special guest who will join you.

1575
00:53:21,788 --> 00:53:23,150
- Isn't it Do Yeon? - She's on her way.

1576
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,620
If it is, she's working hard today.

1577
00:53:24,624 --> 00:53:25,950
- Is it Do Yeon? - Do Yeon is working hard.

1578
00:53:25,959 --> 00:53:27,535
Why is she covering her face?

1579
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:29,660
- Jang Do Man. - Why are you back?

1580
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:31,290
What's wrong with her nose?

1581
00:53:31,298 --> 00:53:32,330
(They burst out laughing.)

1582
00:53:32,332 --> 00:53:34,030
I came after Big Nose Seok Jin.

1583
00:53:34,034 --> 00:53:36,000
What did you do to your nose?

1584
00:53:36,002 --> 00:53:37,300
(This is Jang Nose Yeon.)

1585
00:53:37,304 --> 00:53:38,630
That's very detailed.

1586
00:53:38,638 --> 00:53:41,070
- You didn't have to do that. - She really came back.

1587
00:53:41,074 --> 00:53:42,985
You don't have to do that.

1588
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:45,070
- It's all right. - What's wrong?

1589
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:46,210
(She tries to take off the burden.)

1590
00:53:46,213 --> 00:53:47,610
Let's get going.

1591
00:53:47,614 --> 00:53:49,380
This mission is called...

1592
00:53:49,382 --> 00:53:51,410
Nationwide Zero Human.

1593
00:53:51,418 --> 00:53:53,450
You will be given five minutes.

1594
00:53:53,453 --> 00:53:55,750
Within five minutes, you must bring someone...

1595
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:57,590
who's from your hometown.

1596
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:59,220
(Bring someone from your hometown in 5 minutes.)

1597
00:53:59,226 --> 00:54:00,905
Where would I find someone from Gangwon Province?

1598
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:02,560
No one is from Dongducheon.

1599
00:54:02,562 --> 00:54:03,660
(It's impossible to find people from their hometowns.)

1600
00:54:03,663 --> 00:54:05,160
I can't find anyone.

1601
00:54:05,165 --> 00:54:06,830
It can be anyone from the same province.

1602
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,200
- Gyeongsang Province? - That's right.

1603
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:10,970
- There are many from Gyeonggi. - Right.

1604
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,500
- There are many from Seoul. - Of course.

1605
00:54:12,506 --> 00:54:13,700
There are many from Gyeongsang Province.

1606
00:54:13,707 --> 00:54:15,200
Can it be a staff member?

1607
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,240
That's possible.

1608
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:18,310
- Start. - Start.

1609
00:54:18,311 --> 00:54:20,855
There will be a few from Seoul.

1610
00:54:21,248 --> 00:54:23,155
- How about Gyeongsang Province? - Isn't he from Gyeonggi Province?

1611
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,250
- Yu Ri. - I'm from Seoul.

1612
00:54:25,252 --> 00:54:28,320
Are you from Seoul? I can bring you. Come here, Yu Ri.

1613
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:31,120
Anyone from Gyeongsang Province? No? Why isn't there anyone?

1614
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:32,590
Where's your hometown?

1615
00:54:32,592 --> 00:54:34,390
- I'm from Seoul. - Seoul?

1616
00:54:34,394 --> 00:54:35,620
Where were you born?

1617
00:54:35,629 --> 00:54:36,630
In Gyeonggi Province.

1618
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,630
(She finds someone easily.)

1619
00:54:37,631 --> 00:54:39,390
Gyeonggi Province? Come with me.

1620
00:54:39,399 --> 00:54:40,860
Are you from Gyeongsang Province?

1621
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:43,030
- I am. - Come with me for a moment.

1622
00:54:43,036 --> 00:54:45,000
- It doesn't matter to me. - All right.

1623
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:46,500
- Where are you from? - Gangwon Province.

1624
00:54:46,506 --> 00:54:48,370
Gangwon Province! Where specifically?

1625
00:54:48,375 --> 00:54:50,210
- Chuncheon. - Let's go.

1626
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,510
- Have you all gathered? - Yes.

1627
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:55,640
Let's start from the left. Please introduce yourselves.

1628
00:54:55,649 --> 00:54:57,380
- Introduce yourselves. - Hi.

1629
00:54:57,384 --> 00:54:58,580
Where are you from?

1630
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:01,435
Hello, I'm from Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province.

1631
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,635
- Mungyeong. - Mungyeong.

1632
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:05,450
I'm from the south.

1633
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:07,775
That's not the right accent.

1634
00:55:08,128 --> 00:55:09,760
You're so bad at it.

1635
00:55:09,763 --> 00:55:12,930
If you try to do the accent, it sounds awkward.

1636
00:55:12,933 --> 00:55:13,930
What do you think?

1637
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,570
- It sounds awkward. - You sound awkward.

1638
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:19,030
- Do you think so? - People don't do that.

1639
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,570
Is that right?

1640
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:22,100
- That's cool. - I have an accent.

1641
00:55:22,108 --> 00:55:25,510
- That's not it. - The weather is great.

1642
00:55:25,512 --> 00:55:27,310
- What do you think about that? - It's not right at all.

1643
00:55:27,314 --> 00:55:28,625
Why?

1644
00:55:29,149 --> 00:55:31,310
He's so bad with accents.

1645
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:32,950
How are you supposed to say it then?

1646
00:55:32,953 --> 00:55:36,150
- In Gyeongsang Province... - Say, "The weather is nice."

1647
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:37,490
This is nice.

1648
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,650
(It's simple.)

1649
00:55:38,658 --> 00:55:39,990
You don't overdo it.

1650
00:55:39,993 --> 00:55:42,020
It has to be light.

1651
00:55:42,028 --> 00:55:44,330
- Did he kind of exaggerate? - He exaggerated too much.

1652
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:45,575
(That's what the expert says.)

1653
00:55:46,099 --> 00:55:47,200
How embarrassing.

1654
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,100
(I'll protect my accents.)

1655
00:55:49,102 --> 00:55:51,945
- Next to me... - All right.

1656
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:54,370
is the scriptwriter Yu Ri.

1657
00:55:54,374 --> 00:55:57,010
- She's been with us for a while. - Right.

1658
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:58,870
You're the scriptwriter for Running Man,

1659
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:01,125
so do you have any requests for us?

1660
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:03,650
- Be honest. - I hope...

1661
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:05,880
I hope you don't break any rules.

1662
00:56:05,885 --> 00:56:09,320
Rule breaker. Who are you talking about specifically?

1663
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:12,220
Some people destroy the rules.

1664
00:56:12,225 --> 00:56:14,490
(They destroy rules.)

1665
00:56:14,494 --> 00:56:16,830
Somebody destroys the rules.

1666
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,030
- She didn't say who. - Don't take it the wrong way.

1667
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:21,460
She didn't say it was you.

1668
00:56:21,468 --> 00:56:23,570
Right. She didn't.

1669
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,870
Is there somebody else?

1670
00:56:25,872 --> 00:56:29,000
There are two more people who keep destroying the rules.

1671
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:30,740
- They destroy rules? - Right.

1672
00:56:30,744 --> 00:56:32,240
So Min, I see.

1673
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:34,525
I agree. It's them.

1674
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:36,040
Let me ask you this.

1675
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:38,510
Who's worse? The rule breaker or the rule destroyers?

1676
00:56:38,518 --> 00:56:39,750
Who's worse?

1677
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:41,035
Who is it?

1678
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:43,990
(She's been with us for 2 years. She never had this dilemma before.)

1679
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,290
(Rule breaker...)

1680
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,290
(versus rule destroyers)

1681
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:49,675
The rule breaker.

1682
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:51,845
The rule breaker.

1683
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:55,830
- She didn't say who it was. - This is great.

1684
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:59,830
To be honest, Jong Kook bends the rules,

1685
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,840
- so our staff has to work harder. - They improve.

1686
00:57:01,841 --> 00:57:02,870
- That's right. - They're on alert.

1687
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:05,410
- If not, we would have stalled. - Of course. I agree.

1688
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:08,410
I agree. Next. What is your role?

1689
00:57:08,415 --> 00:57:10,250
I am part of the camera team.

1690
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:12,380
She's part of the camera team.

1691
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:14,250
- The cameras. - What's hard...

1692
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:16,480
and fun about your job? You can say what's fun first.

1693
00:57:16,489 --> 00:57:20,220
It's fun to watch you guys...

1694
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:21,660
- without any editing. - You can watch us live.

1695
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:23,460
You're in the moment.

1696
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:25,360
- I agree. - You're in the moment.

1697
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:26,560
You sound so pure.

1698
00:57:26,566 --> 00:57:29,830
You watched many segments that didn't make the cut, right?

1699
00:57:29,836 --> 00:57:32,545
Are there some people who may be banned from TV?

1700
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:35,455
(Gazing)

1701
00:57:36,242 --> 00:57:38,610
- She looked at Kwang Soo. - Me?

1702
00:57:38,611 --> 00:57:41,010
- She can't deny it. - It's okay.

1703
00:57:41,014 --> 00:57:42,480
- She was looking up. - She was.

1704
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:44,150
- But... - She looked at Kwang Soo.

1705
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:46,650
Watch your mouth. You have to watch yourself.

1706
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:48,850
Is there anything you would like from us?

1707
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:50,705
Don't block the shots.

1708
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,390
- We block the cameras. - That's right.

1709
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:56,120
Who keeps blocking your camera?

1710
00:57:56,129 --> 00:57:57,830
(Gazing)

1711
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:59,075
Me again?

1712
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,730
- Kwang Soo. She looked up again. - No, wait.

1713
00:58:01,735 --> 00:58:02,860
Why did you block it?

1714
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,470
I didn't mean to.

1715
00:58:04,471 --> 00:58:06,530
- I was trying to look. - Be careful.

1716
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:07,840
I will.

1717
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:09,740
She told me directly, so I know now.

1718
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:11,940
- Pay attention. - I'll be cautious.

1719
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:14,440
That was Eun Ji. Who's next?

1720
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:15,940
- He's our scriptwriter. - Right.

1721
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:18,150
I don't have anything to do, so can I interview him?

1722
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:21,165
- Sure. Go ahead. - I'm really bored.

1723
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:24,250
- Hello. You're our scriptwriter. - Yes.

1724
00:58:24,257 --> 00:58:26,720
He used to be on "Infinite Challenge".

1725
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:30,445
Why are you here?

1726
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:32,460
(Why are you here?)

1727
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,860
- Goodness. - Why are you here, punk?

1728
00:58:34,868 --> 00:58:37,645
(I'm trying to move on.)

1729
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:39,830
Stop it.

1730
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:41,055
(I get to see you a day late, but it's still nice to see you.)

1731
00:58:41,508 --> 00:58:43,985
- What a coincidence. - I know.

1732
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:47,580
Don't insert the skull faces around us.

1733
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,580
You keep inserting them in the subtitles.

1734
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:51,480
They're trying to make fun of us.

1735
00:58:51,484 --> 00:58:54,650
They can insert the running skeletons.

1736
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:56,850
- Goodness. - All right.

1737
00:58:56,856 --> 00:58:59,350
- Then... - I'm looking forward to this one.

1738
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,490
She's Jae Seok's stylist.

1739
00:59:00,493 --> 00:59:01,820
She's my stylist.

1740
00:59:01,828 --> 00:59:03,320
Let's ask her all the questions we have.

1741
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:05,430
Is there anything you want Jae Seok to fix?

1742
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:06,805
Is there anything?

1743
00:59:18,215 --> 00:59:20,240
Is there anything you want Jae Seok to fix?

1744
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,680
Is there anything?

1745
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:23,125
(He's anxious.)

1746
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,395
(A close associate of Jae Seok reveals his secret.)

1747
00:59:26,052 --> 00:59:28,620
His pants are too tight.

1748
00:59:28,621 --> 00:59:29,995
(That's not presentable.)

1749
00:59:31,024 --> 00:59:33,835
She said his pants are too tight. He wears skinny jeans.

1750
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,060
I can't give them up.

1751
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:39,745
Excuse me. Why is it so tight around the hips?

1752
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:41,900
He prefers those types of clothes.

1753
00:59:41,901 --> 00:59:44,030
- He likes tight clothes. - Does he?

1754
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:45,730
You can't put it that way.

1755
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:47,940
If he likes tight-fitting clothes so much,

1756
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:49,940
you should paint his body.

1757
00:59:49,943 --> 00:59:51,270
It'll look like he has clothes on.

1758
00:59:51,277 --> 00:59:53,110
Stop it.

1759
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,180
Goodness.

1760
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:56,440
(That's Jae Seok's secret fashion style.)

1761
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:59,710
- Let's start the Zero game. - Okay.

1762
00:59:59,719 --> 01:00:01,950
This is tough.

1763
01:00:01,955 --> 01:00:04,420
- How? - This is too hard.

1764
01:00:04,424 --> 01:00:06,720
You must sit or stand at the same time...

1765
01:00:06,726 --> 01:00:08,360
- I call out a number. - Okay.

1766
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,630
You win if the number of people who stand up...

1767
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,060
is different from the number I call.

1768
01:00:12,065 --> 01:00:15,160
You have to win five times in a row.

1769
01:00:15,168 --> 01:00:16,915
- All right. - We have to be different from her.

1770
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,370
- In a row? - You must win in a row.

1771
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,100
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1772
01:00:21,107 --> 01:00:22,940
Start. Let's start.

1773
01:00:22,942 --> 01:00:24,470
1, 2, 3. 7 people.

1774
01:00:24,477 --> 01:00:27,410
(Do Yeon yells out "7".)

1775
01:00:27,413 --> 01:00:29,140
- What a relief. - We won.

1776
01:00:29,148 --> 01:00:30,710
We won once.

1777
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,950
- She'll do "zero" too. - She will.

1778
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:34,165
All right.

1779
01:00:35,188 --> 01:00:36,650
(This is a mental game.)

1780
01:00:36,656 --> 01:00:39,290
1, 2, 3. 4 people.

1781
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:41,405
2, 3. 4 people.

1782
01:00:43,796 --> 01:00:45,245
Bravo.

1783
01:00:45,365 --> 01:00:46,530
(They lose...)

1784
01:00:46,532 --> 01:00:48,745
(after the second attempt.)

1785
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:50,970
Did you stand up on purpose?

1786
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:51,970
(If Running Man loses, there's more material to air.)

1787
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:54,055
You are on the staff's side, right?

1788
01:00:54,107 --> 01:00:56,300
- Did you stand up on purpose? - No.

1789
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:57,785
(Yu Ri is hardworking.)

1790
01:00:58,444 --> 01:01:00,210
- Did we lose? - Did we?

1791
01:01:00,213 --> 01:01:02,940
You failed the mission. You have another chance.

1792
01:01:02,949 --> 01:01:04,550
- If you give up a name tag, - Hold on.

1793
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,280
- we'll give you another chance. - Okay.

1794
01:01:06,286 --> 01:01:08,520
(They get another chance if they give up a name tag.)

1795
01:01:08,521 --> 01:01:09,520
Okay.

1796
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:12,020
Stand up. Stand up, Yu Ri.

1797
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:13,660
- Who stood up earlier? - Who just stood up?

1798
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,160
We can get Jong Kook's name tag.

1799
01:01:15,161 --> 01:01:19,260
Look. We're in this together. I don't want another chance then.

1800
01:01:19,265 --> 01:01:22,875
This is what Yu Ri was talking about.

1801
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:24,930
You're a rule breaker.

1802
01:01:24,938 --> 01:01:26,670
- Listen to me. - Okay.

1803
01:01:26,673 --> 01:01:29,270
We're doing this for everybody's good.

1804
01:01:29,275 --> 01:01:31,840
- I'm not entirely responsible. - Fine. Then the four of you,

1805
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:33,780
- do rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

1806
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,940
- If they lose, - Sounds good?

1807
01:01:35,949 --> 01:01:38,180
- their partner gets the penalty. - Okay.

1808
01:01:38,184 --> 01:01:40,080
- You have to win. - Do rock-paper-scissors.

1809
01:01:40,086 --> 01:01:41,180
Good luck.

1810
01:01:41,187 --> 01:01:43,050
Rock-paper-scissors

1811
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:45,350
(Jae Seok and Se Chan win. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo lose.)

1812
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:47,290
All right! Nice.

1813
01:01:47,293 --> 01:01:48,605
Great.

1814
01:01:49,996 --> 01:01:52,260
Do you want a fist fight?

1815
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:54,730
What? Why would they do that?

1816
01:01:54,734 --> 01:01:57,470
I don't know who'll win then.

1817
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:00,100
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1818
01:02:00,106 --> 01:02:03,170
(Ji Hyo loses, and Jong Kook wins.)

1819
01:02:03,176 --> 01:02:06,110
- We take Ji Hyo's name tag. - Okay.

1820
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:08,340
- Her name wasn't on the roulette. - That's right.

1821
01:02:08,348 --> 01:02:10,280
Let's do better.

1822
01:02:10,283 --> 01:02:11,710
Let's go, Gyeongsang Province.

1823
01:02:11,718 --> 01:02:13,410
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1824
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:15,735
- Let's get started. - Ready.

1825
01:02:15,922 --> 01:02:18,150
1, 2, 3. 7 people.

1826
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:20,250
(First attempt)

1827
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:22,290
- I almost stood up. - This is good.

1828
01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:24,190
- We won once. - You won once.

1829
01:02:24,197 --> 01:02:28,160
Let's go again. 1, 2, 3. 3 people.

1830
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:30,200
(Second attempt)

1831
01:02:30,203 --> 01:02:31,970
- Okay. - All right.

1832
01:02:31,971 --> 01:02:33,070
(They win the second attempt...)

1833
01:02:33,072 --> 01:02:34,100
(this time.)

1834
01:02:34,107 --> 01:02:35,755
- Good. - All right.

1835
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:39,640
Here we go. 1, 2, 3. 5 people.

1836
01:02:39,645 --> 01:02:41,540
(Third attempt)

1837
01:02:41,547 --> 01:02:44,165
- That was close. - We have four people.

1838
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:45,750
Good thing I didn't stand up.

1839
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:48,120
- 2 more times? - We only need to win 2 more times.

1840
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:50,620
Here's the fourth attempt.

1841
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,020
1, 2, 3. 6 people.

1842
01:02:53,026 --> 01:02:54,575
(Six!)

1843
01:02:55,194 --> 01:02:57,290
(4 people stand up...)

1844
01:02:57,296 --> 01:02:59,090
(and 2 more on either side of Haha.)

1845
01:02:59,098 --> 01:03:00,130
We lost.

1846
01:03:00,133 --> 01:03:02,775
(Did they fail the mission?)

1847
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:06,070
(7 people stood up.)

1848
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:08,040
We got seven.

1849
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,470
Good thing I stood up, right?

1850
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:11,470
- We did it. - Last one.

1851
01:03:11,477 --> 01:03:12,740
- There's one left. - Last one.

1852
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:15,225
- This is the last one. - We only have one left.

1853
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:16,910
(Let's keep going.)

1854
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,525
Here's the last one.

1855
01:03:19,352 --> 01:03:21,820
(If they win this time...)

1856
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,950
1, 2...

1857
01:03:23,956 --> 01:03:25,520
(If they win this time, they can obtain a hint.)

1858
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:27,520
3. 7 people.

1859
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,290
(Seven!)

1860
01:03:29,295 --> 01:03:31,160
- 2... Hold on. - It's 7.

1861
01:03:31,164 --> 01:03:33,560
(Did seven people stand up?)

1862
01:03:33,566 --> 01:03:34,975
Seven.

1863
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:37,770
(8 people stood up.)

1864
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,000
2... Hold on.

1865
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:40,800
2, 4, 6, 8.

1866
01:03:40,807 --> 01:03:42,140
Okay.

1867
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:43,840
(They succeed the mission.)

1868
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:45,210
- We did it. - What a relief.

1869
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:47,410
- We won. - What a relief.

1870
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:49,755
- That was so close. - We did it.

1871
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:52,450
- We got it. - We did it.

1872
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:54,335
Thanks, Yu Ri. Thank you.

1873
01:03:55,054 --> 01:03:57,290
We did it. All right.

1874
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,720
We'll be able to open it once we see this.

1875
01:03:58,724 --> 01:04:00,050
- I think so. - It's this.

1876
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:01,660
- This... - What?

1877
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,375
- Chuseok? - It's a half-moon-shaped rice cake.

1878
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:05,145
Half-moon-shaped rice cake.

1879
01:04:05,331 --> 01:04:06,460
- Chuseok? Two syllables? - Chuseok.

1880
01:04:06,466 --> 01:04:08,000
- Moon. Chuseok. - Is this it?

1881
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,260
(What is this?)

1882
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:10,670
- 2 syllables. Chuseok. - 2 syllables.

1883
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:11,900
Chuseok.

1884
01:04:11,904 --> 01:04:13,515
- Half-moon-shaped rice cake. - Half-moon-shaped rice cake.

1885
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,955
- I think that's it. - What?

1886
01:04:16,576 --> 01:04:19,525
It's larger than me.

1887
01:04:20,012 --> 01:04:21,410
I think it's a date in between.

1888
01:04:21,414 --> 01:04:22,440
- It is a date? - Birthday?

1889
01:04:22,448 --> 01:04:23,980
Right? Three syllables.

1890
01:04:23,983 --> 01:04:25,750
- Your birthday is August 20, right? - Yes, August 20.

1891
01:04:25,751 --> 01:04:26,880
My birthday is August 14.

1892
01:04:26,886 --> 01:04:28,450
That works.

1893
01:04:28,454 --> 01:04:30,950
- August 15. - That's you.

1894
01:04:30,957 --> 01:04:32,690
(Ji Hyo's birthday is on August 15.)

1895
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:33,690
- Me? - Her birthday?

1896
01:04:33,693 --> 01:04:35,420
- 815? - But...

1897
01:04:35,428 --> 01:04:37,775
there are so many numbers in between.

1898
01:04:38,431 --> 01:04:40,530
What does this mean then? August 15 and...

1899
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:42,560
- That's the confusing part. - That is.

1900
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:44,670
- Victory. - Do we only get one chance?

1901
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:46,970
(They only get one chance to open the briefcase.)

1902
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:50,270
(If they don't open it in one try, they all get the penalty.)

1903
01:04:50,276 --> 01:04:51,440
Do you want to try another one?

1904
01:04:51,444 --> 01:04:52,870
- We have to. - Just one more?

1905
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:54,080
Let's be certain.

1906
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,925
Let's be certain. We only get one chance.

1907
01:04:56,115 --> 01:04:59,780
(What is the passcode of the briefcase?)

1908
01:04:59,785 --> 01:05:01,120
Here's the game.

1909
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,350
What's the most important thing about going home on Chuseok?

1910
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:05,690
- Safe driving. - Safe driving is important.

1911
01:05:05,691 --> 01:05:07,290
So this mission is called...

1912
01:05:07,293 --> 01:05:10,490
Drive Safely on Your Way Home on Chuseok.

1913
01:05:10,496 --> 01:05:12,090
(Fourth mission: Drive Safely)

1914
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:13,160
This is nice.

1915
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,630
- Drive safely. - Drive safely.

1916
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:17,030
The rule is simple.

1917
01:05:17,036 --> 01:05:19,000
You have to reverse park this car...

1918
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:22,100
without touching the paper cups.

1919
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:23,440
I'm an expert.

1920
01:05:23,442 --> 01:05:25,440
(They have to reverse park without making the paper cups fall.)

1921
01:05:25,444 --> 01:05:28,155
Let's roll the die...

1922
01:05:28,214 --> 01:05:29,640
and decide how many people will play.

1923
01:05:29,649 --> 01:05:31,650
A certain number of people have to do it.

1924
01:05:31,651 --> 01:05:33,050
I hope it's one.

1925
01:05:33,052 --> 01:05:34,750
Kwang Soo is a horrible driver.

1926
01:05:34,754 --> 01:05:36,935
- I'm even worse at parking. - Oh, dear.

1927
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,950
- Roll the die. - I'll do it.

1928
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,490
(Nobody asked him to do it.)

1929
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:41,720
Will you?

1930
01:05:41,727 --> 01:05:43,660
- Hey, it's Chuseok. - Do it.

1931
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:44,990
- Start. - Start.

1932
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:46,345
(They're worried.)

1933
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:49,500
(He rolls the die as if he's throwing a yut.)

1934
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:51,645
(Is he lucky today?)

1935
01:05:53,806 --> 01:05:55,000
(Please let it be 3.)

1936
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:56,800
- No... - It's six.

1937
01:05:56,809 --> 01:05:58,770
(Of course.)

1938
01:05:58,778 --> 01:06:00,225
It's six.

1939
01:06:00,813 --> 01:06:01,910
(This is driving me nuts.)

1940
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:03,840
6. 6 people have to do it.

1941
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:05,210
Let's do this.

1942
01:06:05,218 --> 01:06:06,695
Okay, who's starting?

1943
01:06:07,153 --> 01:06:09,550
- I'll go. - Make the best driver go.

1944
01:06:09,555 --> 01:06:10,990
- Jae Seok, - I'll show you.

1945
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:13,290
- you're the best driver. - Go ahead.

1946
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:14,975
You can do it.

1947
01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:16,660
Here he goes.

1948
01:06:16,662 --> 01:06:18,675
- Start. - Go.

1949
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,160
It's slow.

1950
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:23,060
You need to reverse park without making the cups fall.

1951
01:06:23,069 --> 01:06:25,785
It has to be at the level of your shoulders.

1952
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:27,540
There's a rear-view mirror.

1953
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,570
You have to go a little bit more. That's good. Stop.

1954
01:06:29,575 --> 01:06:31,540
That's good. Reverse.

1955
01:06:31,544 --> 01:06:33,010
(He just needs to reverse now.)

1956
01:06:33,012 --> 01:06:36,355
- The opening is too narrow. - It's so narrow.

1957
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:39,765
(He adds some background music.)

1958
01:06:40,853 --> 01:06:42,580
(Wait)

1959
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:43,895
Stop!

1960
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,820
(He's about to bump into it.)

1961
01:06:45,825 --> 01:06:47,935
Be careful!

1962
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,890
Stop fooling around.

1963
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:52,230
Don't enjoy this.

1964
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:53,790
- You have to go a little bit more. - I think I'm good.

1965
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:55,860
- No! - Watch the left.

1966
01:06:55,868 --> 01:06:58,015
- Straighten out your wheel. - It has to fit perfectly.

1967
01:06:58,104 --> 01:06:59,100
You have space on the right.

1968
01:06:59,105 --> 01:07:00,915
- Straighten out your wheel. - Keep going.

1969
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,940
- Watch the left. - Go forward.

1970
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:04,370
No, reverse.

1971
01:07:04,377 --> 01:07:06,355
You almost had it.

1972
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:07,940
No, reverse.

1973
01:07:07,947 --> 01:07:09,825
You almost had it.

1974
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:11,795
(He goes forward again.)

1975
01:07:12,985 --> 01:07:15,135
(He's the only one who's excited.)

1976
01:07:15,288 --> 01:07:17,365
He's having fun.

1977
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,550
- It's breezy, - What a rascal.

1978
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:22,305
and there are people around, so he's happy.

1979
01:07:22,461 --> 01:07:24,730
- They're watching him too. - I'm so happy.

1980
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,190
He mentioned that.

1981
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:29,060
He wanted to ride this when he was a child.

1982
01:07:29,068 --> 01:07:31,830
- I really wanted to ride this. - He did.

1983
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:33,745
(He reverses abruptly as he talks.)

1984
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,000
They didn't fall.

1985
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:38,340
- You have to go out. - Go out.

1986
01:07:38,344 --> 01:07:39,870
- Go straight slowly. - Straighten out.

1987
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,640
- He touched it. - Keep going.

1988
01:07:42,648 --> 01:07:43,840
That's good.

1989
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:46,480
(He has a little bit more to go.)

1990
01:07:46,485 --> 01:07:48,380
- You did it. - I did it.

1991
01:07:48,387 --> 01:07:51,135
(He passes the mission while humming an addictive tune.)

1992
01:07:51,157 --> 01:07:52,465
Great job.

1993
01:07:53,059 --> 01:07:55,175
(They complimented him too much.)

1994
01:07:55,828 --> 01:07:57,335
He's cute.

1995
01:07:58,030 --> 01:07:59,290
Hey, come back.

1996
01:07:59,298 --> 01:08:01,075
(It took him 47 years to realize that he enjoys speed.)

1997
01:08:01,434 --> 01:08:02,630
(He drives the convertible in the vast plains.)

1998
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:04,045
What is wrong with you?

1999
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:06,000
- He likes to drive. - He must be so happy.

2000
01:08:06,005 --> 01:08:07,340
- He likes to drive. - Yes.

2001
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,485
I'll return the car.

2002
01:08:09,608 --> 01:08:11,140
This is valet parking.

2003
01:08:11,143 --> 01:08:13,070
- Is it? - This is a valet.

2004
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:14,510
- You have to pay me two dollars. - Okay.

2005
01:08:14,513 --> 01:08:16,110
You know it's four dollars now, right?

2006
01:08:16,115 --> 01:08:17,780
- Oh, dear. - My goodness.

2007
01:08:17,783 --> 01:08:19,595
- I have to use the door. - Right.

2008
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:20,980
Who's next?

2009
01:08:20,986 --> 01:08:22,120
- Seok Jin. - Should I go?

2010
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:23,450
Go ahead, Seok Jin.

2011
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,750
He'll be fine.

2012
01:08:24,757 --> 01:08:26,520
- Drift. - He's a good driver.

2013
01:08:26,525 --> 01:08:27,590
He is.

2014
01:08:27,593 --> 01:08:29,720
I'm amazing. Start.

2015
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:31,045
(Can he recover from rolling a bad number?)

2016
01:08:31,497 --> 01:08:33,430
(That's drifting.)

2017
01:08:33,432 --> 01:08:35,760
He can be on the Gangbyeon Expressway.

2018
01:08:35,768 --> 01:08:38,100
You can go to your in-laws' with this.

2019
01:08:38,104 --> 01:08:39,630
(He can ride this to his in-laws'.)

2020
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:41,340
He has to leave two days before.

2021
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,485
- Slowly. - Come on.

2022
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,885
(He lines up the back of his car with the opening.)

2023
01:08:46,178 --> 01:08:47,580
(He reverses at full speed.)

2024
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:48,825
- Seok Jin. - Goodness.

2025
01:08:48,881 --> 01:08:51,065
- Seok Jin. - Goodness.

2026
01:08:51,117 --> 01:08:52,525
Gosh...

2027
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:53,750
Hold on.

2028
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:55,550
- This... - What is your problem?

2029
01:08:55,554 --> 01:08:56,720
I didn't...

2030
01:08:56,722 --> 01:08:57,950
do it on purpose.

2031
01:08:57,957 --> 01:08:59,850
- I swear I didn't. - What is your problem?

2032
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:01,320
- No, listen. - What is wrong with you?

2033
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:02,620
I couldn't stop it.

2034
01:09:02,628 --> 01:09:04,890
My foot won't come off.

2035
01:09:04,897 --> 01:09:07,190
He's stuttering.

2036
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,500
Get out.

2037
01:09:08,501 --> 01:09:09,660
Can I try another time?

2038
01:09:09,668 --> 01:09:11,200
- You can't. We failed. - You can't.

2039
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:12,630
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

2040
01:09:12,638 --> 01:09:14,100
(The third driver is the lucky Ji Hyo.)

2041
01:09:14,106 --> 01:09:15,200
Stop!

2042
01:09:15,207 --> 01:09:16,300
(She fails because of one cup.)

2043
01:09:16,308 --> 01:09:17,985
That was so close.

2044
01:09:18,010 --> 01:09:20,010
You're supposed to turn it once, right?

2045
01:09:20,012 --> 01:09:21,555
This is small...

2046
01:09:21,814 --> 01:09:24,095
(Driving in real life is different from the manual.)

2047
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:26,395
(She slams on the pedal and knocks over the cups.)

2048
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:28,680
(This is a true muscle car.)

2049
01:09:28,687 --> 01:09:31,035
(The fifth driver is the talented Jong Kook. He succeeds.)

2050
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:33,390
(It suits him 100 percent. Is this his car?)

2051
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:34,860
He drives this at home occasionally.

2052
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:36,390
(He tried it at home thanks to his son.)

2053
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:37,975
- Success. - You did it.

2054
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:40,460
- More, more. - Okay.

2055
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,260
(Se Chan succeeds as well.)

2056
01:09:42,268 --> 01:09:43,760
Kwang Soo, you have to succeed.

2057
01:09:43,769 --> 01:09:46,245
- You can do it. Go ahead. - We'll use the chance card

2058
01:09:46,705 --> 01:09:49,615
You have to succeed so that we can use Do Yeon.

2059
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:51,070
This is easy for him.

2060
01:09:51,076 --> 01:09:52,540
- We're almost done. - Okay.

2061
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:54,495
How is Kwang Soo's driving?

2062
01:09:54,947 --> 01:09:56,340
- He's... - He's dangerous.

2063
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:58,495
not very talented.

2064
01:09:58,884 --> 01:10:01,250
He pretends like he's a good driver.

2065
01:10:01,253 --> 01:10:03,180
Yes, that's how bad drivers are.

2066
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:05,165
(That's how bad drivers are.)

2067
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:07,565
- Start. - I'll do it my style.

2068
01:10:07,793 --> 01:10:09,205
- Start! - Okay.

2069
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:12,175
He put the lights on.

2070
01:10:12,798 --> 01:10:15,575
You have to succeed so that we can use Do Yeon.

2071
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:18,100
Kwang Soo, you have to make big turns.

2072
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:19,430
(He has to succeed so that they can use Do Yeon.)

2073
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:21,140
What's that? That looks cool.

2074
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:22,515
(His left hand is barely holding on.)

2075
01:10:23,642 --> 01:10:26,225
(He looks pretty cool.)

2076
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:28,040
You have to do this.

2077
01:10:28,047 --> 01:10:29,980
(Version 2 of his awesomeness)

2078
01:10:29,982 --> 01:10:31,865
Women like that move.

2079
01:10:32,418 --> 01:10:34,225
Your backside looks beautiful.

2080
01:10:34,987 --> 01:10:36,680
(Is it time to show my skills?)

2081
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:38,420
He's turning the wheel the other way.

2082
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:40,250
(He doesn't know a thing about driving.)

2083
01:10:40,259 --> 01:10:41,920
- Like this? - Of course.

2084
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:43,875
How did you get your license?

2085
01:10:44,196 --> 01:10:46,360
- Hey, how did you get it? - This is driving me nuts.

2086
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:48,215
- Stop. - No, don't come.

2087
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:49,930
(He's close.)

2088
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,430
- Go forward. - You have to go forward.

2089
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:53,745
Good. Come.

2090
01:10:53,973 --> 01:10:55,485
- More. One more time. - Keep coming.

2091
01:10:55,574 --> 01:10:57,340
- The front side... - Good.

2092
01:10:57,343 --> 01:10:58,755
(Moving)

2093
01:10:58,777 --> 01:11:00,210
(That's a new way of using the wheel.)

2094
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:01,610
Good. Good job.

2095
01:11:01,614 --> 01:11:03,010
- Go in. - Go straight in.

2096
01:11:03,015 --> 01:11:04,080
Keep going. Okay.

2097
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,410
Okay. Good. A little bit more.

2098
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:06,925
Your front is not straight.

2099
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:09,850
(If I'm not straight in the front...)

2100
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:10,990
Not too much.

2101
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:12,205
- Stop! - Stop!

2102
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:15,575
(He was almost done, but he moves back abruptly.)

2103
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:19,190
(He went too much.)

2104
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:20,505
Stop.

2105
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:22,000
- No, he got it. - He's good.

2106
01:11:22,001 --> 01:11:23,200
- Go forward. - Do I go forward?

2107
01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:24,770
- I'll go forward. - He's good.

2108
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,030
You have to watch these two.

2109
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:28,140
(Did he fail or succeed?)

2110
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,485
Let's see.

2111
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:34,155
(Please don't fall.)

2112
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,680
- Let's see. - He's good. All right.

2113
01:11:36,682 --> 01:11:39,595
(They didn't fall.)

2114
01:11:39,885 --> 01:11:41,450
Go. Go straight.

2115
01:11:41,453 --> 01:11:43,580
- You're good. Go. - Go straight.

2116
01:11:43,589 --> 01:11:44,820
Your wheel.

2117
01:11:44,823 --> 01:11:45,850
You're good.

2118
01:11:45,858 --> 01:11:47,090
- He's good. - Okay.

2119
01:11:47,092 --> 01:11:48,990
(The last driver, Kwang Soo, gets lucky and succeeds.)

2120
01:11:48,994 --> 01:11:50,475
- Let's use Do Yeon. - Success.

2121
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:52,160
- Do I go? - Do Yeon Chance.

2122
01:11:52,164 --> 01:11:54,045
Kwang Soo, you looked cool.

2123
01:11:55,668 --> 01:11:57,045
Jang Do Yeon Chance.

2124
01:11:57,303 --> 01:11:59,585
- Jang Do Yeon... - Jang Do Yeon Chance.

2125
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:01,140
Let's do this.

2126
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,900
The gas is on the right, and the brake is on the left, right?

2127
01:12:03,909 --> 01:12:05,170
- Do Yeon. - This...

2128
01:12:05,177 --> 01:12:06,940
- It's this. - Bring it down.

2129
01:12:06,946 --> 01:12:08,080
That's reverse.

2130
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,525
- That's drive. - I see.

2131
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:12,195
- Drive. - This is reverse.

2132
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:14,165
- Don't leave your door open. - Hold on.

2133
01:12:14,286 --> 01:12:16,180
- Stop! - There's a camera.

2134
01:12:16,188 --> 01:12:18,150
(She almost collides with the camera.)

2135
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:20,450
- You almost broke the camera. - Do Yeon.

2136
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:22,090
- What is this? - There's no brake.

2137
01:12:22,094 --> 01:12:23,760
- Is there no brake? - No, there isn't.

2138
01:12:23,762 --> 01:12:25,330
- Drive. - What do we do?

2139
01:12:25,331 --> 01:12:27,900
She has big feet, so she can't take her feet off.

2140
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,945
We're in trouble. We can't do it.

2141
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,370
Go towards the right. Good.

2142
01:12:33,372 --> 01:12:34,740
Take your foot off.

2143
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,070
- Take your foot off. - Reverse.

2144
01:12:36,075 --> 01:12:37,100
- Do Yeon. - Yes?

2145
01:12:37,109 --> 01:12:40,370
Turn the steering wheel the other way.

2146
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:41,880
(He didn't tell her to move.)

2147
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,710
- Stop! - The other way.

2148
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:46,110
Turn the wheel the other way.

2149
01:12:46,118 --> 01:12:48,580
- Go forward more. - This is too different from my car.

2150
01:12:48,587 --> 01:12:50,520
Whose car is it like?

2151
01:12:50,522 --> 01:12:51,935
Go forward more.

2152
01:12:52,524 --> 01:12:54,265
- Good. Stop. - Good.

2153
01:12:54,326 --> 01:12:56,135
Reverse, Do Yeon. Change the gear.

2154
01:12:56,595 --> 01:12:58,575
She's too serious.

2155
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:01,445
Come. A little bit more.

2156
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:03,860
- Stop. - Good.

2157
01:13:03,869 --> 01:13:05,400
- A little bit more. - Press on it lightly.

2158
01:13:05,404 --> 01:13:07,200
- Put your foot on it. - You're good.

2159
01:13:07,206 --> 01:13:09,700
- Turn the wheel. - To the right slightly.

2160
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,900
- Do Yeon, reverse. - Reverse.

2161
01:13:10,909 --> 01:13:12,610
- Stop! - Good.

2162
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:13,710
(Stop)

2163
01:13:13,712 --> 01:13:15,940
- Move slightly. - Keep it at that.

2164
01:13:15,948 --> 01:13:17,280
- Move very slightly. - Keep it at that.

2165
01:13:17,282 --> 01:13:19,010
- A little bit more. - One more time.

2166
01:13:19,018 --> 01:13:21,495
One more time. Just once.

2167
01:13:21,954 --> 01:13:23,750
- That's right. - Move as much as you did...

2168
01:13:23,756 --> 01:13:25,290
- one more time. - Reverse.

2169
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:26,720
- Reverse. - A little bit more.

2170
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:29,090
- One more time. - Reverse.

2171
01:13:29,094 --> 01:13:30,675
Go a little bit farther.

2172
01:13:31,263 --> 01:13:32,890
- One more time. - A little bit more.

2173
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:34,460
- Go a little bit farther. - Mind the handle.

2174
01:13:34,466 --> 01:13:35,530
- Okay. - A little bit more.

2175
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:36,930
- Yes! - Yes!

2176
01:13:36,935 --> 01:13:38,500
(She did it.)

2177
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:39,530
Gosh, she did it.

2178
01:13:39,538 --> 01:13:42,170
It's not an easy task.

2179
01:13:42,174 --> 01:13:44,255
You completed a difficult task.

2180
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:46,570
- Do Yeon. - Her foot got stuck.

2181
01:13:46,578 --> 01:13:47,780
She has big feet.

2182
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,580
- Good job, Jang Do Feet. - Jang Do Feet.

2183
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:51,180
- Thank goodness. - Good job.

2184
01:13:51,183 --> 01:13:52,410
(She is moved.)

2185
01:13:52,418 --> 01:13:53,925
Thank goodness.

2186
01:13:54,486 --> 01:13:56,820
Since you succeeded, you will get two hints.

2187
01:13:56,822 --> 01:13:58,120
Bravo.

2188
01:13:58,123 --> 01:13:59,490
We will know the passcode now.

2189
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:00,850
I am 100-percent sure of it.

2190
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:03,390
- Hangawi. - Hangawi.

2191
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:05,460
"Hangawi" and "Scissors" sound similar.

2192
01:14:05,464 --> 01:14:08,030
On the lunar calendar, Chuseok is August 15.

2193
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:09,530
That means the passcode is 815.

2194
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,770
- Ji Hyo's birthday is August 15th. - 815.

2195
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,530
- That's right. - The passcode is 815.

2196
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:14,970
- It's 815. - Let's go.

2197
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:17,600
Do you want to try the passcode or try the next mission?

2198
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:19,070
- We will go and try the passcode. - We will go.

2199
01:14:19,078 --> 01:14:20,170
(They decide to open the briefcase.)

2200
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:24,055
(Is the passcode 815 as they think?)

2201
01:14:24,516 --> 01:14:27,050
(The lobby of Mok-dong SBS)

2202
01:14:27,052 --> 01:14:28,635
There is the briefcase!

2203
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:29,820
We found it!

2204
01:14:29,822 --> 01:14:31,505
- Move out of the way! - 815!

2205
01:14:32,057 --> 01:14:33,090
It's mine.

2206
01:14:33,092 --> 01:14:34,935
- It's the briefcase! - 815.

2207
01:14:36,228 --> 01:14:38,045
- Hold on. - Let's open it. Try 815.

2208
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,190
Which way do the numbers go?

2209
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,760
- 8 should go first. - 815.

2210
01:14:41,767 --> 01:14:43,075
Eight.

2211
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:45,885
- Eight. - Maybe it won't open again.

2212
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:48,055
(Nervous)

2213
01:14:49,508 --> 01:14:52,025
1, 5.

2214
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:57,455
(They only have one chance. Let's see if the briefcase opens.)

2215
01:14:57,783 --> 01:14:59,280
(Clicking)

2216
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:01,520
(The passcode is 815.)

2217
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,865
There is the mission card.

2218
01:15:03,388 --> 01:15:04,650
(Expectant)

2219
01:15:04,656 --> 01:15:08,975
(What is the secret on the mission card?)

2220
01:15:09,161 --> 01:15:10,360
"Go to the ninth floor."

2221
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:13,890
(Go to the 9th floor.)

2222
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:15,760
- What is this? - Did we wait a week for this?

2223
01:15:15,768 --> 01:15:18,200
- Did we wait a week for this? - Is this it?

2224
01:15:18,203 --> 01:15:20,370
- Is this it? - What is this?

2225
01:15:20,372 --> 01:15:22,385
Something else will begin.

2226
01:15:22,708 --> 01:15:26,625
The ninth floor? Okay. Let's go and see what's there.

2227
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:30,195
Maybe Do Yeon is running over to the ninth floor.

2228
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:33,580
If Do Yeon is there again, I am going to have a word with her.

2229
01:15:33,585 --> 01:15:35,580
The ninth floor? Do we go that way?

2230
01:15:35,587 --> 01:15:37,080
- Let's take the elevator. - I can't believe it.

2231
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:38,350
I saw Do Yeon remove the microphone.

2232
01:15:38,357 --> 01:15:40,650
- What a letdown. We waited a week. - Is this it?

2233
01:15:40,659 --> 01:15:41,860
- Let's go. - The ninth floor.

2234
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,735
(They are on their way to the 9th floor.)

2235
01:15:44,963 --> 01:15:46,330
So Min, wear this.

2236
01:15:46,331 --> 01:15:47,390
Why?

2237
01:15:47,399 --> 01:15:48,400
(You look cute when you wear it, So Min.)

2238
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,115
- I think it's cute. - It's cute.

2239
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,470
Kwang Soo is wearing it.

2240
01:15:52,471 --> 01:15:53,470
(He has the same hairband.)

2241
01:15:53,472 --> 01:15:54,670
(Peek-a-boo)

2242
01:15:54,673 --> 01:15:57,785
(The same bunny-ear hairbands look different on them.)

2243
01:15:58,043 --> 01:16:01,085
(Hello, I am Kwang Soo.)

2244
01:16:02,481 --> 01:16:04,025
Kwang Soo is such an eyesore.

2245
01:16:05,751 --> 01:16:09,150
Kwang Soo, they want you to go to the 10th floor.

2246
01:16:09,154 --> 01:16:10,480
(Do you take me for a fool?)

2247
01:16:10,489 --> 01:16:11,890
All right. All right.

2248
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,850
(I heard everything too.)

2249
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:17,860
Don't hit me. It hurts. All right. All right. All right.

2250
01:16:17,863 --> 01:16:20,375
I was joking.

2251
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:22,600
(I promise I will kick you if you do it again.)

2252
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:24,600
(The violent bunny goes to the 9th floor with everyone.)

2253
01:16:24,603 --> 01:16:25,885
All right.

2254
01:16:27,439 --> 01:16:29,570
We came back to where we started.

2255
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:31,825
We could have stayed here.

2256
01:16:32,377 --> 01:16:33,625
- What? - What?

2257
01:16:34,046 --> 01:16:35,680
Kwang Soo, there is a panel.

2258
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:37,310
What? There is something.

2259
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:38,550
(A mysterious panel stands in the garden.)

2260
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,550
- Chuseok. - Chuseok.

2261
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,950
(Chuseok)

2262
01:16:41,954 --> 01:16:45,265
- What is that? - There are Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

2263
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,390
(It's a Chuseok panel with the faces of Seok Jin and Jae Seok.)

2264
01:16:48,393 --> 01:16:49,760
What is this?

2265
01:16:49,761 --> 01:16:51,120
- Jong Kook. - There is something.

2266
01:16:51,129 --> 01:16:52,360
There is a final mission.

2267
01:16:52,364 --> 01:16:53,390
(They find the final mission card.)

2268
01:16:53,398 --> 01:16:54,430
The final mission?

2269
01:16:54,433 --> 01:16:56,100
(What's the final mission?)

2270
01:16:56,101 --> 01:16:58,670
"Arrest the Chuseok Brothers who are hiding in the building..."

2271
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,770
- "in 20 minutes." - Seok Jin and Jae Seok?

2272
01:17:00,772 --> 01:17:02,115
Seok Jin and Jae Seok?

2273
01:17:02,608 --> 01:17:05,240
(Search the building,)

2274
01:17:05,244 --> 01:17:08,740
(and find Jae Seok and Seok Jin in 20 minutes.)

2275
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:10,695
They both have "Seok" in their names.

2276
01:17:10,816 --> 01:17:13,610
"Chu" from Chuseok can mean "to chase".

2277
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:15,450
- "Chase Seok Jin and Jae Seok." - Let's go.

2278
01:17:15,454 --> 01:17:16,965
We have 20 minutes.

2279
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:21,760
(The 2nd floor of the SBS building 30 minutes before the shoot)

2280
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:22,760
What?

2281
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:24,420
Will we have a special mission today?

2282
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:26,760
Today is the day.

2283
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:28,745
This is that briefcase.

2284
01:17:29,167 --> 01:17:31,485
This is that briefcase we saw before.

2285
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:34,145
- Right. Where are the others? - Hey.

2286
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:35,970
Can't you tell?

2287
01:17:35,974 --> 01:17:38,310
The two of us must have an important task.

2288
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,240
I carried it everywhere.

2289
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:42,210
Why is there a phone?

2290
01:17:42,214 --> 01:17:43,755
What is this?

2291
01:17:45,217 --> 01:17:46,210
There is nothing.

2292
01:17:46,218 --> 01:17:48,435
What's inside this briefcase? Can we open it?

2293
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:50,120
- No? - They told us not to open it.

2294
01:17:50,122 --> 01:17:52,805
(Clicking)

2295
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:55,220
- I can't believe you! - It opens.

2296
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:58,990
Come on, I didn't open it. It's unlocked.

2297
01:17:58,997 --> 01:18:00,990
(He wants to know what's inside.)

2298
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:02,630
Shall I open it?

2299
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:04,030
(Let's take a peek.)

2300
01:18:04,036 --> 01:18:05,300
- Let's open it. - What is inside?

2301
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:06,830
- We are the only ones here. - What's this?

2302
01:18:06,838 --> 01:18:08,770
(They open the Pandora's box.)

2303
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:10,115
- What is this? - What is it?

2304
01:18:12,077 --> 01:18:14,070
"We told you not to open it."

2305
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:16,855
- For goodness' sake. - "Why did you open it?"

2306
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,380
"We told you not to open it."

2307
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:22,665
(Are you kidding me?)

2308
01:18:24,022 --> 01:18:25,365
What?

2309
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:27,820
"You must go where the staff tells you to go..."

2310
01:18:27,826 --> 01:18:29,590
"because you received the Blank Penalty Ticket."

2311
01:18:29,594 --> 01:18:31,590
(You must go where the crew tells you to go...)

2312
01:18:31,596 --> 01:18:33,660
(because you received the Blank Penalty Ticket.)

2313
01:18:33,665 --> 01:18:35,800
- What is this? - You are a bad person.

2314
01:18:35,801 --> 01:18:37,060
(Where do they want us to go?)

2315
01:18:37,069 --> 01:18:39,615
- Where do you want us to go? - Where do you want us to go?

2316
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:44,400
- Hold on. - Why did you open it?

2317
01:18:44,409 --> 01:18:46,770
They told me to do whatever I wanted.

2318
01:18:46,778 --> 01:18:48,625
What is the Blank Penalty Ticket?

2319
01:18:49,581 --> 01:18:50,740
Hello.

2320
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:52,710
(Nervous)

2321
01:18:52,718 --> 01:18:55,780
Last week, I told you not to open the briefcase.

2322
01:18:55,787 --> 01:18:57,820
- The Blank Penalty Ticket? - That was last week.

2323
01:18:57,823 --> 01:18:59,520
Seok Jin opened it. I don't know anything about it.

2324
01:18:59,524 --> 01:19:01,460
- I just opened... - I will put him on the phone.

2325
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,820
(He tosses over the phone.)

2326
01:19:03,829 --> 01:19:05,590
- What are you doing? - You flipped it open...

2327
01:19:05,597 --> 01:19:06,730
- after I unlocked it. - You opened it.

2328
01:19:06,732 --> 01:19:08,260
You flipped it open.

2329
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:10,060
- You opened it. - I simply unlocked it.

2330
01:19:10,068 --> 01:19:12,970
- Why did you fiddle with it? - Hello.

2331
01:19:12,971 --> 01:19:13,970
Hello.

2332
01:19:13,972 --> 01:19:16,270
Last week, the briefcase contained...

2333
01:19:16,274 --> 01:19:18,610
the Blank Penalty Ticket.

2334
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:20,970
(My goodness.)

2335
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:22,780
Don't act when you heard the mission.

2336
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:24,440
- Hello. What did you say? - What are you doing?

2337
01:19:24,449 --> 01:19:25,750
Please tell me once more.

2338
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:29,150
Why are you doing this with the two of us?

2339
01:19:29,154 --> 01:19:31,050
Last week, Seok Jin...

2340
01:19:31,056 --> 01:19:34,790
- lost the briefcase twice. - That's right. He lost it twice.

2341
01:19:34,793 --> 01:19:36,960
Last week, you said,

2342
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:39,560
"I will take the briefcase now."

2343
01:19:39,564 --> 01:19:41,160
(Last week, you said, "I will take the briefcase now.")

2344
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:42,900
I said it once,

2345
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:45,130
but Haha took the responsibility.

2346
01:19:45,137 --> 01:19:46,345
(I just said that out of frustration.)

2347
01:19:47,139 --> 01:19:50,400
(Jae Seok saw Seok Jin lose the briefcase.)

2348
01:19:50,409 --> 01:19:51,710
(I will take the briefcase now.)

2349
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:54,780
(He regrets saying those words.)

2350
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,095
There is a way to avoid the penalty.

2351
01:19:57,749 --> 01:19:59,980
Find out the passcode,

2352
01:19:59,985 --> 01:20:01,965
- open the briefcase, - And?

2353
01:20:02,087 --> 01:20:06,235
and come back here in secret. Then I will tell you.

2354
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:08,290
You want us to come back here without telling the members?

2355
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,235
Where? Here? Without telling the members?

2356
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:14,145
(When the members went to the 9th floor)

2357
01:20:14,566 --> 01:20:16,200
I need to use the restroom.

2358
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:17,230
(Jae Seok excused himself in a natural way.)

2359
01:20:17,235 --> 01:20:19,930
(Okay. I can follow Jae Seok.)

2360
01:20:19,938 --> 01:20:21,230
For goodness' sake.

2361
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:23,770
Is there a way to go to the second floor from here?

2362
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,340
- No. - We have to go that way.

2363
01:20:25,343 --> 01:20:27,625
They will see us right away.

2364
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,010
What are these?

2365
01:20:29,014 --> 01:20:30,440
- What are these? - What are these?

2366
01:20:30,449 --> 01:20:32,465
- Bells? - There are bells.

2367
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:38,405
(There are 10 bells and new uniforms for them.)

2368
01:20:38,423 --> 01:20:39,865
What's the final mission?

2369
01:20:40,225 --> 01:20:42,160
"Hide from the members who are pursuing you."

2370
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:44,360
"If you don't get arrested, you are exempt from the penalty."

2371
01:20:44,362 --> 01:20:46,960
"Two members who are chosen by the roulette get the penalty."

2372
01:20:46,965 --> 01:20:49,560
"If you get arrested, you get the penalty."

2373
01:20:49,568 --> 01:20:50,660
This is driving me crazy.

2374
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:53,230
"You must wear the 10 bells among yourselves."

2375
01:20:53,238 --> 01:20:54,685
(10 bells?)

2376
01:20:55,073 --> 01:20:56,070
This is driving me crazy.

2377
01:20:56,074 --> 01:20:57,840
If we wear the bells, it's a given.

2378
01:20:57,843 --> 01:20:59,925
We are likely to get caught as we are,

2379
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:02,625
but they want us to run with the bells.

2380
01:21:04,082 --> 01:21:09,795
(They change into red uniforms.)

2381
01:21:11,423 --> 01:21:13,065
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

2382
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:15,390
Put one bell on your sneakers.

2383
01:21:15,393 --> 01:21:16,620
I will wear one bell.

2384
01:21:16,628 --> 01:21:17,660
(Wear 9 bells, Seok Jin.)

2385
01:21:17,662 --> 01:21:20,190
I will wear nine bells. I will wear them all.

2386
01:21:20,198 --> 01:21:21,190
(Seok Jin gets 9 bells.)

2387
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:22,700
Don't get caught.

2388
01:21:22,701 --> 01:21:25,215
- Will you wear all the bells? - Yes, I will.

2389
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:27,515
Seok Jin, I will survive no matter what.

2390
01:21:28,106 --> 01:21:29,740
- You need to survive. - That's right.

2391
01:21:29,741 --> 01:21:31,200
I really don't want the penalty.

2392
01:21:31,209 --> 01:21:33,470
"If you fail to arrest them, the Chuseok Brothers get exempt."

2393
01:21:33,478 --> 01:21:35,480
"Two members who are chosen by the roulette get the penalty."

2394
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,255
Two members? The chance is too great.

2395
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,950
Shouldn't we run?

2396
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:41,750
We parted ways on the first floor.

2397
01:21:41,753 --> 01:21:43,050
Where would you go?

2398
01:21:43,054 --> 01:21:44,720
They said they were going to the restroom.

2399
01:21:44,723 --> 01:21:46,190
5, 4.

2400
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:47,565
- Already? - Are we getting started?

2401
01:21:48,059 --> 01:21:49,120
Four.

2402
01:21:49,127 --> 01:21:50,460
(If they get arrested, they get the penalty.)

2403
01:21:50,462 --> 01:21:51,960
- Three. - We are getting started.

2404
01:21:51,963 --> 01:21:53,675
Why don't we split up?

2405
01:21:53,999 --> 01:21:56,130
- Two. - Let's not get penalized.

2406
01:21:56,134 --> 01:21:57,160
- One. - Seriously.

2407
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:59,100
- Let's go. - We have 20 minutes.

2408
01:21:59,104 --> 01:22:00,700
(The Chuseok Brothers are out if they get touched.)

2409
01:22:00,705 --> 01:22:04,300
(Can they arrest them in this big building...)

2410
01:22:04,309 --> 01:22:06,225
(in 20 minutes?)

2411
01:22:08,246 --> 01:22:10,655
(The Chuseok Race starts.)

2412
01:22:11,616 --> 01:22:13,325
Kwang Soo, good luck.

2413
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:15,450
Let's search the first floor and go underground.

2414
01:22:15,453 --> 01:22:17,150
Let's go underground...

2415
01:22:17,155 --> 01:22:19,265
- and check out the other side. - The other side.

2416
01:22:19,324 --> 01:22:21,760
They could be on the first floor.

2417
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,460
Jae Seok likes...

2418
01:22:23,461 --> 01:22:25,390
the open space.

2419
01:22:25,397 --> 01:22:26,830
Where are they?

2420
01:22:26,831 --> 01:22:28,030
They must be hiding.

2421
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:29,315
The first floor.

2422
01:22:29,434 --> 01:22:30,930
I will get going.

2423
01:22:30,936 --> 01:22:32,100
Go.

2424
01:22:32,103 --> 01:22:34,085
(Jae Seok goes first.)

2425
01:22:34,839 --> 01:22:36,000
(His movements are light since he has 1 bell.)

2426
01:22:36,007 --> 01:22:37,640
Where should we go?

2427
01:22:37,642 --> 01:22:39,085
(His movements are light since he has 1 bell.)

2428
01:22:39,678 --> 01:22:43,725
(While Jae Seok moves around the 2nd floor,)

2429
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:47,195
(Se Chan appears on the 1st floor.)

2430
01:22:47,652 --> 01:22:49,620
They must be... I hear the bells.

2431
01:22:49,621 --> 01:22:51,380
(I hear the bells somewhere.)

2432
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:54,890
(Kwang Soo hears Jae Seok's bell from the 1st floor.)

2433
01:22:54,893 --> 01:22:57,175
(Let's run away.)

2434
01:22:57,662 --> 01:23:00,645
(Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, Se Chan)

2435
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:04,060
(I hear it from above.)

2436
01:23:04,069 --> 01:23:05,315
(Kwang Soo begins chasing after the sound.)

2437
01:23:05,737 --> 01:23:07,600
- What is it? - I hear the bells.

2438
01:23:07,606 --> 01:23:09,000
Did you hear it? Was it above you?

2439
01:23:09,007 --> 01:23:10,455
Yes, above.

2440
01:23:10,542 --> 01:23:13,010
- Jong Kook. - Okay. Let's go upstairs.

2441
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:14,655
(The hunters close in.)

2442
01:23:15,247 --> 01:23:17,310
(Jae Seok is at the top of the staircase.)

2443
01:23:17,315 --> 01:23:20,995
(Jae Seok runs away through the side door.)

2444
01:23:21,353 --> 01:23:24,050
(As soon as the door closes,)

2445
01:23:24,055 --> 01:23:26,965
(Kwang Soo enters by a close call.)

2446
01:23:28,226 --> 01:23:31,675
(He passes by the door Jae Seok disappeared into.)

2447
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:36,175
(I definitely heard the sound from here. Did he go that way?)

2448
01:23:36,534 --> 01:23:40,685
(What a relief. I almost got caught.)

2449
01:23:41,806 --> 01:23:43,870
This is too dangerous.

2450
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:45,270
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin with 9 bells...)

2451
01:23:45,277 --> 01:23:46,770
Which floor is the editing room on?

2452
01:23:46,778 --> 01:23:48,980
- 6th floor. - Let's go to the 6th floor.

2453
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,280
- Does that go to the sixth floor? - Yes.

2454
01:23:50,282 --> 01:23:51,995
The editing room is complicated to get around.

2455
01:23:52,617 --> 01:23:54,780
(Clattering)

2456
01:23:54,786 --> 01:23:56,580
(He goes to the elevator while making a lot of noises.)

2457
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:59,220
6th floor. Let's go to the 6th floor.

2458
01:23:59,224 --> 01:24:01,765
If I last for about 15 minutes,

2459
01:24:02,060 --> 01:24:04,220
Jae Seok can probably last five minutes by himself.

2460
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:05,775
(He can manage from then on, right?)

2461
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:13,545
(He arrives on the 6th floor where the editing room is.)

2462
01:24:14,539 --> 01:24:15,570
(The editing room is across the hall.)

2463
01:24:15,573 --> 01:24:16,570
No one is here, right?

2464
01:24:16,574 --> 01:24:19,185
(The editing room is across the hall.)

2465
01:24:19,210 --> 01:24:23,740
(Let me hold out for 15 minutes in this complicated-looking floor.)

2466
01:24:23,748 --> 01:24:25,625
I'm going to run. I'm going to run there.

2467
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:30,965
(He runs to the editing room with a big plan in mind.)

2468
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:34,565
(What? He runs into Haha right away.)

2469
01:24:35,126 --> 01:24:37,435
(His grand plan has failed, and he runs away.)

2470
01:24:37,729 --> 01:24:41,960
(I got you! Freeze!)

2471
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:44,960
(Haha was checking the editing rooms on the 6th floor by chance.)

2472
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:46,345
Excuse me.

2473
01:24:47,172 --> 01:24:48,230
(He spotted Seok Jin on the 6th floor.)

2474
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,240
Hold on a second.

2475
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,755
(Is this destiny?)

2476
01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:54,385
(What a lucky find! Seok Jin is given to him on a silver platter.)

2477
01:24:55,113 --> 01:24:57,255
(Hello, Seok Jin!)

2478
01:24:57,849 --> 01:25:00,710
(Forget about 15 minutes. He's on the run in his 1st minute.)

2479
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:04,795
(He runs into a dead-end studio.)

2480
01:25:06,124 --> 01:25:08,105
I'm sorry. Please excuse us.

2481
01:25:08,526 --> 01:25:10,935
(Seok Jin desperately runs one last time while Haha says hello.)

2482
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:14,075
(Let me stay in the race for a bit longer today.)

2483
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:15,775
(Haha touches him.)

2484
01:25:16,267 --> 01:25:18,160
(Seok Jin is arrested.)

2485
01:25:18,169 --> 01:25:20,770
- I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry.

2486
01:25:20,772 --> 01:25:22,570
I had a feeling he was on this floor.

2487
01:25:22,574 --> 01:25:24,355
How could we meet there?

2488
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:27,870
- How could we meet there? - Are you all right?

2489
01:25:27,879 --> 01:25:29,155
I'm fine.

2490
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:32,210
The race starts. Jae Seok.

2491
01:25:32,217 --> 01:25:35,295
This was our plan. It was our plan. Make sure you stay alive.

2492
01:25:35,787 --> 01:25:39,635
Jee Seok Jin is eliminated.

2493
01:25:39,657 --> 01:25:42,405
What? Already?

2494
01:25:42,627 --> 01:25:44,990
- Already? - We started about two minutes ago.

2495
01:25:44,996 --> 01:25:46,675
- Really? - Yes.

2496
01:25:46,698 --> 01:25:47,690
Already?

2497
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:49,260
(They're happy but fascinated.)

2498
01:25:49,267 --> 01:25:51,615
It's great since we don't have time.

2499
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:53,985
Why did you give Seok Jin such an important assignment?

2500
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:56,055
This is no fun.

2501
01:25:56,341 --> 01:25:58,415
This is no fun. I didn't get to watch it.

2502
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:01,725
What? What did you say?

2503
01:26:02,013 --> 01:26:03,780
- He's out. - He's already eliminated?

2504
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:05,880
(Seriously, Seok Jin? I must last 15 minutes all by myself?)

2505
01:26:05,884 --> 01:26:08,365
My gosh, this guy is ridiculous.

2506
01:26:09,554 --> 01:26:12,090
- Where was that hall earlier? - You pressed 13th floor.

2507
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:13,735
- Ji Hyo, let's go down. - 13th floor?

2508
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:15,620
Let's check the 13th floor.

2509
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:17,820
I don't think Jae Seok went up to a high floor.

2510
01:26:17,829 --> 01:26:21,645
But think about it. He has to hide, so...

2511
01:26:22,767 --> 01:26:23,975
Goodness.

2512
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:27,485
Ji Hyo, that's awesome!

2513
01:26:27,505 --> 01:26:28,840
(Jackpot)

2514
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,885
Jae Seok is here!

2515
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:34,085
(Jae Seok was trying to hide in the open hall.)

2516
01:26:34,979 --> 01:26:39,765
(He was caught at an impeccable timing before their eyes.)

2517
01:26:40,351 --> 01:26:43,565
(He's the sole survivor! Catch Jae Seok!)

2518
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:46,435
- Where is that? - Ji Hyo.

2519
01:26:46,825 --> 01:26:48,165
Ji Hyo.

2520
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:52,160
Hold on. Hold on a second, Ji Hyo. Give me a second, Ji Hyo.

2521
01:26:52,163 --> 01:26:54,105
How did we meet so quickly?

2522
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:56,100
- How could we meet there? - We met face to face.

2523
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,530
- This is not right. How could... - We got him right away.

2524
01:26:58,536 --> 01:26:59,770
How could this happen?

2525
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:01,970
- How could we have met here? - Hold on. Hey.

2526
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:04,170
- Why did you come up here? - She said she wanted to come here.

2527
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:06,370
Besides, when the elevator doors opened up,

2528
01:27:06,377 --> 01:27:08,440
you passed by us right there then.

2529
01:27:08,446 --> 01:27:10,780
Why did you pass by at that time?

2530
01:27:10,782 --> 01:27:12,810
(This was only 1 minute ago.)

2531
01:27:12,817 --> 01:27:16,050
(I'll stay in the open hall on the 13th floor and hold out there.)

2532
01:27:16,054 --> 01:27:19,465
(I got a feeling from the open hall on the 13th floor.)

2533
01:27:20,258 --> 01:27:24,275
(Like telepathy, they both thought of the open hall.)

2534
01:27:25,763 --> 01:27:32,545
(And out of 1,200 seconds, they came face-to-face in that 1 second.)

2535
01:27:33,037 --> 01:27:35,800
- Out of all the time, why now? - Exactly.

2536
01:27:35,807 --> 01:27:38,085
Why did you pass by us then? What is this?

2537
01:27:38,176 --> 01:27:39,870
- Already? - What's more is that...

2538
01:27:39,878 --> 01:27:41,325
(Touching)

2539
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:42,740
When the door was open...

2540
01:27:42,747 --> 01:27:45,980
I didn't mean to touch him. What should we do?

2541
01:27:45,984 --> 01:27:48,750
I didn't mean to touch him. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

2542
01:27:48,753 --> 01:27:50,520
I touched you by accident when I was stroking my hair.

2543
01:27:50,522 --> 01:27:51,620
I was just doing this.

2544
01:27:51,623 --> 01:27:52,935
(Touching)

2545
01:27:53,157 --> 01:27:54,550
- Your hand was just there. - You've been arrested.

2546
01:27:54,559 --> 01:27:56,975
(She even perfectly reenacted the scene.)

2547
01:27:57,195 --> 01:28:00,405
- Let's go. - My day is just like that sunset.

2548
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:02,560
(Just like the sunset...)

2549
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:04,060
That was so futile.

2550
01:28:04,068 --> 01:28:06,470
- Yu Jae Seok is eliminated. - We'll go to the lobby now.

2551
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:08,015
Yu Jae Seok is eliminated.

2552
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,455
This is no fun. What is this?

2553
01:28:10,475 --> 01:28:12,840
- It already ended? - Yes.

2554
01:28:12,844 --> 01:28:13,910
Really?

2555
01:28:13,912 --> 01:28:15,580
(Only 6 minutes passed, but it's over?)

2556
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:16,910
(He didn't even see the Chuseok Brothers.)

2557
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:19,580
Seriously? What did they do to get caught?

2558
01:28:19,584 --> 01:28:20,610
What is this?

2559
01:28:20,618 --> 01:28:23,050
You guys had a great plan. 1 of you had only 1 bell.

2560
01:28:23,054 --> 01:28:24,420
It was a great strategy.

2561
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,220
Why did you get caught so quickly?

2562
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:27,250
What about you?

2563
01:28:27,258 --> 01:28:29,835
What do you mean? You guys had about a 30-second difference.

2564
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:32,890
- Stop it. Be quiet. - It was about the same.

2565
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:35,275
Gosh, this is crazy.

2566
01:28:35,767 --> 01:28:37,160
- Are you all right? - She's back?

2567
01:28:37,168 --> 01:28:38,970
You're wearing the same outfit from this morning.

2568
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:40,670
(The Briefcase Girl shows up for the last time.)

2569
01:28:40,672 --> 01:28:42,915
- This is crazy. - You didn't go home yet.

2570
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:46,340
Dangerous Delivery Part Two. The Secret of the Briefcase.

2571
01:28:46,344 --> 01:28:49,110
Last week, the staff had put in a Blank Penalty Ticket...

2572
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:52,425
where the member had to go wherever the staff chose.

2573
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:54,050
(We would've been in a royal mess.)

2574
01:28:54,052 --> 01:28:55,720
Had we opened this, we would've been in big trouble.

2575
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,080
(Feeling dizzy)

2576
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:59,450
- If someone opened the briefcase, - We could've been in trouble.

2577
01:28:59,457 --> 01:29:01,965
all of you had to leave right away.

2578
01:29:02,226 --> 01:29:05,690
- Where would I go with Seok Jin? - Seriously. I have a lot of work.

2579
01:29:05,697 --> 01:29:09,275
- What about us? - They will leave next week.

2580
01:29:09,767 --> 01:29:11,700
(They will be dragged to wherever the staff chooses next week.)

2581
01:29:11,703 --> 01:29:14,070
- Good for you. - My goodness.

2582
01:29:14,072 --> 01:29:16,270
- Kwang Soo. - This could've been terrible.

2583
01:29:16,274 --> 01:29:17,755
We should congratulate them.

2584
01:29:17,775 --> 01:29:21,370
All right. I hope you will spend...

2585
01:29:21,379 --> 01:29:22,780
- a nice Chuseok. - Right.

2586
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:24,740
I hope you'll be blessed with an abundance.

2587
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:26,150
I'd like to thank Jang Do Feet...

2588
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:29,050
- for joining us today. - Great work, everyone.

2589
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:32,050
I don't know where we'll end up next week.

2590
01:29:32,056 --> 01:29:34,550
We'll see you from somewhere next week.

2591
01:29:34,559 --> 01:29:36,820
- We don't get to choose, right? - They'll go anywhere.

2592
01:29:36,828 --> 01:29:39,160
We'll see you next week. Bye.

2593
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:40,845
Bye!

2594
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:42,460
Seok Jin, that sounded rude.

2595
01:29:42,467 --> 01:29:44,630
- Just like that character. - They'll edit it out if it is.

2596
01:29:44,636 --> 01:29:46,415
You said that the other day too.

2597
01:29:47,305 --> 01:29:51,470
(Screaming)

2598
01:29:51,476 --> 01:29:54,185
(What am I doing here?)

2599
01:30:01,085 --> 01:30:03,765
(Dangerous Delivery Finale: Dangerous Trip)
