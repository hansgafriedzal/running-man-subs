1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,432
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,034
- Hello. - The weather is gorgeous.

3
00:00:11,034 --> 00:00:12,936
- Hi. - Ji Hyo is wearing green.

4
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,704
- The weather is gorgeous. - You are right.

5
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:16,640
- Our outfits suit the weather. - They are wearing colorful clothes.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,242
- Yes, they are. - Only we are wearing dark clothes.

7
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,344
The four of them are like the Teletubbies.

8
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:23,346
(Guess what I realized.)

9
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:26,149
- You are right. - It's the Teletubbyland.

10
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,651
- Laa Laa. - You are right.

11
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,953
- Po. - You are right.

12
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,288
- Tinky-Winky. - You know,

13
00:00:31,288 --> 00:00:33,256
this is my first time to see Jong Kook wearing a bright color.

14
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:34,658
You are Laa Laa.

15
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:37,460
- He is like the manager of a gym. - You know...

16
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:39,162
The manager of a gym is going on a picnic.

17
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:40,864
Seriously.

18
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:43,033
Isn't it nice that I am wearing a bright color?

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,769
(They talk about Jong Kook in a yellow top.)

20
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:47,804
A bee is attracted to Kwang Soo.

21
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:50,640
I thought I should go for a bright look.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,075
Don't do that. It's a bee.

23
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,010
What is it?

24
00:00:55,912 --> 00:00:57,280
Don't do that. It's a bee.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,817
- What is it? - My goodness!

26
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:02,052
A bee almost went into my ear.

27
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:04,354
(My goodness.)

28
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,855
- Was there a bee? - My goodness.

29
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:07,223
There was nothing on the either one of you.

30
00:01:07,223 --> 00:01:09,092
There was a bee. There was a bee.

31
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,161
- There was a bee. - It went that way.

32
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:12,362
I heard it.

33
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:14,864
- Gosh, the two of you are cowards. - I heard it.

34
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,466
(The older members are the most cowardly.)

35
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,601
- His face went red. - I am telling you...

36
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:20,870
- a bee licked my face. - It doesn't have a tongue!

37
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,406
I am telling you a bee was close to my face.

38
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:24,441
Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:26,209
The bee didn't go to Jong Kook.

40
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,944
- What? - He is wearing the same color.

41
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:30,947
Jong Kook is scarier than a bee.

42
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:32,449
- He is a wasp. - Jong Kook's words...

43
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:34,551
- hurt more than a bee sting. - That's right.

44
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:36,319
- Seriously. - So Min, I see that...

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,121
- you didn't miss your flight. - What do you mean?

46
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:39,956
- After our performance abroad, - She left her passport.

47
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:42,058
she left her passport at the hotel.

48
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,394
Seok Jin said to her,

49
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:46,463
"You need to stop being a scatterbrain."

50
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,665
"It makes no sense to leave your passport at the hotel."

51
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,401
But the day before, he left his passport in the car.

52
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:53,069
I don't know what's wrong with him.

53
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:54,771
For two days, he didn't realize.

54
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,872
I don't know what's wrong with him.

55
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:58,308
For two days, he didn't realize he had left his passport.

56
00:01:58,308 --> 00:02:00,243
I didn't realize.

57
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:01,845
You are in no position to patronize her.

58
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:04,080
When we were having a meal yesterday,

59
00:02:04,214 --> 00:02:05,715
why did you slap Jae Seok?

60
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:06,916
- What? - When did I slap him?

61
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:07,951
You slapped him across the face.

62
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:09,386
(They team up to slander him.)

63
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:10,653
- I saw it. - You slapped him.

64
00:02:10,653 --> 00:02:13,123
- He didn't do it as a joke. - He slapped hard.

65
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,392
He used the back of his hand.

66
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:17,827
- You saw it, right? Jae Seok cried. - Jae Seok cried.

67
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:19,763
What are you talking about?

68
00:02:19,763 --> 00:02:23,066
This is how a rumor starts.

69
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:26,436
Jae Seok said he cried because Seok Jin's slap was weak.

70
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:28,772
(Jae Seok said he cried because Seok Jin's slap was weak.)

71
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:32,442
It broke my heart because I didn't feel a thing.

72
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,743
A fly on my cheek would have felt heavier.

73
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:36,012
The slap was loud but painless.

74
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:37,847
You still shouldn't have done it.

75
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:41,818
The slap is loud but painless.

76
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,153
What was that?

77
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,054
- What is it? - It tickles.

78
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:46,556
(It suddenly tickles.)

79
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,824
(Seok Jin's slap tickles.)

80
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,426
- What is going on? - Maybe it's an allergic reaction.

81
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,960
- What is going on? - His slap tickles.

82
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,633
The day after Seok Jin hit me, bees swarmed to my cheek.

83
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:59,135
- He has the Honey Punch. - It was the honey.

84
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,304
Seok Jin also wore a cast the next day.

85
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,740
- My goodness. - Seok Jin, don't hit anyone.

86
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,110
Today, you will have a race in which the ranks are important.

87
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:08,378
- Okay. - The ranks.

88
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:11,648
After three different rounds, you will determine the final ranks.

89
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,484
The 1st to 8th ranks will have different benefits...

90
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,753
and the number of Crown Badges...

91
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,855
which gives you an advantage in the final mission.

92
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,191
Let's decide on the ranks.

93
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,692
How will we decide?

94
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:27,430
- It's a roulette. - Are we using a roulette?

95
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,466
This is good for us.

96
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,034
This is good for us, the youngest members.

97
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,404
The members' names are on the roulette.

98
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,940
The person who gets picked will be in first rank.

99
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,143
Then he or she will decide the rest of the members' ranks.

100
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,845
- All right. - Let my name get picked.

101
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,813
- Let my name get picked. - This is really fair.

102
00:03:43,813 --> 00:03:44,914
It could be anyone.

103
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,749
- Spin it hard. - Let's go. I will spin it hard.

104
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,952
- Let's go. - Please let it be my name.

105
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,687
(The roulette begins to spin.)

106
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:54,057
(Let's see who will get picked as the 1st rank.)

107
00:03:55,024 --> 00:03:56,025
Come on.

108
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,327
Okay. The timing is perfect.

109
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,462
- It will be me. - It will be me.

110
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,931
(He is desperate.)

111
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:03,833
- It will be me. - It will be Kwang Soo.

112
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,834
Please don't let it be him.

113
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,302
(The roulette's decision is...)

114
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:09,138
- No, no! - Yes!

115
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:12,642
(Kwang Soo gets chosen in a pinch.)

116
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,645
(Here comes the 1st rank.)

117
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,647
- No! - Good job!

118
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:18,648
No!

119
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,183
This is the worst.

120
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:23,753
Kwang Soo, the younger members should come together.

121
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,422
(It's our world.)

122
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:28,191
(Haha, come on.)

123
00:04:30,026 --> 00:04:32,295
- Come here. - Why?

124
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:33,930
- The younger members. - You are 40 years old!

125
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,964
You are 40 years old.

126
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,600
Lee Kwang Soo is

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,502
Our sun

128
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:41,237
(Let's praise Lee Kwang Soo.)

129
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,272
I love you.

130
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:45,575
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

131
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,844
- My goodness. - Gosh, don't do this.

132
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:50,046
- Don't do this. - Lee Kwang Soo!

133
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:51,481
(Falling)

134
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:53,616
Don't do this.

135
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:56,486
Gosh, he fell hard.

136
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,855
- Jae Seok did it on purpose. - I think he did it on purpose.

137
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,324
(I am 100-percent sure he did it on purpose.)

138
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:03,660
Kwang Soo, you are too tall.

139
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,364
- I'm sorry. - Why don't you flick his forehead?

140
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:10,199
- His forehead? - He flicked your forehead a lot.

141
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,668
- Shall I do that? - Yes.

142
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,970
- He did flick my forehead a lot. - Hold on.

143
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,772
Why would you flick my forehead?

144
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,840
- Can I flick your forehead? - Why?

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,442
If you let me do it, I will give you an advantage.

146
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,579
Why don't you just put me in the lowest rank instead?

147
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:26,149
- Wait. - For goodness' sake!

148
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:27,417
(What an annoying mouth!)

149
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:30,019
(He can't flick Jae Seok's forehead.)

150
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:31,621
Okay. Okay.

151
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,023
Seok Jin is annoyed.

152
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:35,525
Seok Jin.

153
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,759
What?

154
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:41,364
Oh, he wants water!

155
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:44,334
- Move out of my way! It's my task. - Kwang Soo.

156
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,069
- My goodness. - Here is water.

157
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,470
I will take the other one.

158
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,838
(Annoying)

159
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,340
What is wrong with you?

160
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,643
(He is being really annoying.)

161
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,678
Put me in the lowest rank.

162
00:05:55,945 --> 00:05:59,315
What should I do? Should I do it?

163
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,751
He is using a strange tactic.

164
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,386
Do it and see what happens.

165
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:05,388
Put him in the lowest rank. It won't hurt you.

166
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:07,490
- Jae Seok. - What is going on?

167
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,860
Think about which standard you will use...

168
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,930
to decide on the ranks. Then it will be fair.

169
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,566
The member you want to go on a blind date with.

170
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,567
Okay.

171
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,702
The member I want to go on a blind date with...

172
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,504
- is Jae Seok without a question. - That's right.

173
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:23,539
- He will liven up the atmosphere. - That's right.

174
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:25,575
- And he won't get the girl. - And you look better.

175
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:28,845
(Those are Kwang Soo's reasons for picking Jae Seok.)

176
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:31,347
He will make me shine. I will use a different standard.

177
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,216
- You think I make you shine? - Yes.

178
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:35,318
- That's right. - That's why I'm standing here.

179
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:37,020
- This is driving me crazy. - That's right.

180
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,557
This is driving me crazy.

181
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:43,960
(The standard Kwang Soo used to rank everyone remains a secret.)

182
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,862
- I will announce the ranks. - Okay.

183
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:47,230
Let me come in second.

184
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:49,599
Please. I will be good to you.

185
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,467
Kwang Soo, remember the younger members.

186
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,436
- Kwang Soo. - Put yourself at ease.

187
00:06:53,436 --> 00:06:55,071
- I... - You can change it up now.

188
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,040
- The younger members. - Let's go.

189
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,307
I will announce the ranks first.

190
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:00,810
When Jong Kook put his arm on me,

191
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,413
I let him use my shoulder without thinking.

192
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:04,447
It happens naturally.

193
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,549
I let him use my shoulder.

194
00:07:08,317 --> 00:07:13,389
(Last week, Haha worked as Jong Kook's arm support.)

195
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,560
(Jae Seok succeeded the position without his knowledge.)

196
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,162
(He stuck to Jong Kook like a magnet.)

197
00:07:20,329 --> 00:07:22,131
- I let him use my shoulder. - I see that...

198
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,734
Jong Kook put him on the hook so that he wouldn't run away.

199
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:26,669
His hand is the hook.

200
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,672
When I put my hand on him, he moved towards me.

201
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:31,441
- He was like a magnet. - It happens.

202
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:32,909
It's good as long as you aren't offended.

203
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,210
- I am not offended. - That's right.

204
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,345
It's not like I am going to grow any taller.

205
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:37,947
- He can put his arm on me. - That's right.

206
00:07:37,947 --> 00:07:40,249
- That's right. - They are like safety bars.

207
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,751
- That's right. - He looks comfortable.

208
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:43,553
- Let me announce the ranks. - Okay.

209
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:44,554
(He will announce the ranks.)

210
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:47,924
(Jong Kook's side is the strongest.)

211
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:51,461
(Who will be Kwang Soo's right-hand man?)

212
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:52,829
Jong Kook is the last.

213
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:53,863
(He is certain.)

214
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,667
(Jong Kook is in the bottom rank.)

215
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,168
He's the lowest.

216
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,170
Jong Kook is in the eighth rank.

217
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,271
(It's a festival.)

218
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:04,540
I could have worked for you!

219
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,376
No, you are the last. Be glad it's not the 1,000th rank.

220
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,545
This is good.

221
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:11,614
- The 1st rank is Kwang Soo. - The 2nd rank.

222
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:13,483
- I will announce the second rank. - Who is it?

223
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:15,485
- The second rank. - Let's go.

224
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:17,954
- Come on. - Remember the younger members.

225
00:08:17,954 --> 00:08:19,655
(Who is in the 2nd rank?)

226
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:20,857
- Haha. - There you go.

227
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,191
My goodness.

228
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,659
(Haha is in the 2nd rank.)

229
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,195
- Why? - He and I have a connection.

230
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:28,164
- I think I know. - Move down.

231
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:30,600
- What's this all about? - Please put in the upper ranks.

232
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,269
- Here's how I decided. - Okay.

233
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,938
This is my personal opinion of who dresses well.

234
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,340
(This is the criterion of the ranks.)

235
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,342
- That was my standard. - Then I should be up there.

236
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,610
- Your outfit looks awesome today. - Right.

237
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,411
Then I have a shot.

238
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,046
- You think you have a shot? - You bet I do.

239
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,582
- I should be in the upper ranks. - You think you have a shot?

240
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:47,850
Is that why I'm placed last?

241
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,385
Whatever the criterion is, you'll be placed last.

242
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:52,221
(Determine the ranking of your fashion.)

243
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,289
My goodness.

244
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,191
I dress very well.

245
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:59,462
Here's what I think about Kwang Soo. Putting aside our sense of fashion,

246
00:08:59,796 --> 00:09:02,999
he ranked people based on his grudges.

247
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,767
That's how he ranked us.

248
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,736
He did not rank us based on our outfits.

249
00:09:06,969 --> 00:09:09,939
I always think that I dress very well.

250
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:13,242
I'm not that happy about this.

251
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:15,845
Kwang Soo doesn't know anything.

252
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,647
I should be placed first.

253
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:20,616
- I don't get why Haha is there. - By the way,

254
00:09:20,616 --> 00:09:21,918
- why are you standing there? - Exactly.

255
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:22,919
What do you mean?

256
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,287
- Can't you see? - Why are you standing there?

257
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,422
- Gosh, all of these are mine. - My goodness, that joker.

258
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,523
Dear me.

259
00:09:27,757 --> 00:09:29,692
You put yellow pickled radishes on your eyes.

260
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,961
(You're ridiculous.)

261
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,996
(The lenses do look like pickled radishes.)

262
00:09:33,996 --> 00:09:36,299
Are you trying to make your head look like a shuttlecock?

263
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:39,635
- I hate that you don't get this. - This is so annoying.

264
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,771
Actually, Haha's outfit is the coolest.

265
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:43,973
- Kwang Soo, tell us who's in third. - Yes?

266
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:46,843
Come on. Try to pay more attention to your outfits.

267
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,444
- Okay? - Here's third place.

268
00:09:48,878 --> 00:09:50,346
- Song Ji Hyo. - That's right.

269
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:52,381
(Ji Hyo is placed 3rd.)

270
00:09:52,381 --> 00:09:53,482
(As expected, Ji Hyo is in 3rd.)

271
00:09:53,482 --> 00:09:54,951
- Ji Hyo? - I agree with him.

272
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,319
- I should be next. - I...

273
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:57,720
- It's obvious now. - I'm next.

274
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,821
- I should be in fourth. - Okay.

275
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:01,224
I'm really torn now. As for the seventh place...

276
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,860
- 7th place? That was sudden. - You'll decide that 1st?

277
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,162
- Is it Jae Seok or Seok Jin? - Right.

278
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,497
- Here's the match. - Hey.

279
00:10:08,497 --> 00:10:10,933
- It's here. Goodness. - It's Jae Seok, of course.

280
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:14,103
This is a hard one. Seriously. This match is neck and neck.

281
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,671
Kwang Soo.

282
00:10:16,072 --> 00:10:19,208
I have a good sense of fashion, but I don't show it.

283
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,477
I only shop for clothes.

284
00:10:21,944 --> 00:10:23,946
I only shop for clothes. I don't buy anything else.

285
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:25,114
- Okay. - Pick the fourth place.

286
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,849
I'm not totally satisfied, but...

287
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:27,950
- Jae Seok is... - Okay.

288
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,452
- in seventh place. - Okay.

289
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:32,922
(It means Seok Jin is ranked higher than Jae Seok.)

290
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,991
Hey, you. You come here.

291
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:36,959
- You should go over there. - Seok Jin has won.

292
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,461
- How could Se Chan still be there? - Right?

293
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,962
- He's still there? - That's right.

294
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,164
- My goodness, this is the order. - This is...

295
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:43,733
- Let's be honest. It's me. - Hey, listen.

296
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,568
- I should be in fourth. - This is the right order.

297
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:46,903
- This is the right order. - Kwang Soo.

298
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,337
Se Chan does make an effort.

299
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,639
- That's right. I do. - I make an effort too.

300
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,641
- I invest a lot in my clothes. - I did go shopping a lot.

301
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:53,376
- Right, right. - Come on. I invest in my clothes.

302
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:55,044
- He does have cool clothes. - Exactly.

303
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,245
- Right, but I make an effort too. - He does have a lot of those.

304
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,480
- Se Chan is in sixth. - No.

305
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,616
(Okay. Se Chan is in 6th.)

306
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,251
(Okay! Se Chan is placed 6th!)

307
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,353
- Okay! - Really? Despite my efforts?

308
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,589
- He makes strange efforts. - Seok Jin is ranked too high.

309
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,791
- This is unbelievable. - This makes no sense.

310
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,526
- Okay, go ahead with fourth place. - I can't believe him.

311
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:12,828
- Seok Jin's wife used to be... - Right.

312
00:11:12,828 --> 00:11:14,730
- a stylist back in the days. - Right. She was a professional.

313
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,333
- She quit 20 years ago. - 20 years?

314
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,869
(It's been 20 years since she quit.)

315
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:21,570
- Hey. - Is that why his outfits are...

316
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,339
- from 20 years ago? - He's been staying in the past.

317
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:24,874
It's been 20 years since...

318
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:27,043
- she left that field. - She hasn't lost her touch yet.

319
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:29,545
Come on. You saw my outfits off-camera.

320
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,414
You're torn between So Min and Seok Jin?

321
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,982
- This is crazy. - Come on.

322
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:35,718
Did you see So Min wearing a beret the other day?

323
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,921
- I did see her beret. - I thought Junjin was here.

324
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:40,589
Eun Joo wore that hat.

325
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,592
(She thought she put on a cute hat.)

326
00:11:43,592 --> 00:11:45,828
(She's the spitting image of him.)

327
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:48,064
It went from Jang Hyuk, Junjin,

328
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,765
- That's right. - and to So Min.

329
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,367
(This is the line of celebrities with berets.)

330
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:53,636
- Jang Hyuk was TJ when he wore it. - That's true.

331
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:54,837
It had holes too.

332
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:57,306
- KCM wore that often too. - That's true.

333
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,641
KCM wore that often.

334
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,042
- Let me announce it. - Okay.

335
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,377
(It's a match of retro fashion, Seok Jin versus So Min.)

336
00:12:01,377 --> 00:12:02,878
- 4th place. - 4th place.

337
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:08,184
(Which one of them will be placed 4th after a heated battle?)

338
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:12,555
(After thinking hard about it, the 4th place goes to...)

339
00:12:12,555 --> 00:12:13,990
It's Seok Jin by the shape of his mouth.

340
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,324
- It's "Jee". - Look at his mouth.

341
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,893
- He changed just now. - He changed?

342
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:18,995
How did you know?

343
00:12:19,595 --> 00:12:22,031
(At a crucial moment when the 4th place is about to be announced...)

344
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:24,066
How did you know? Do you know ventriloquism?

345
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,702
How did you figure it out? Is it that obvious?

346
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,504
I know. I can tell by the shape of your mouth.

347
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:30,706
- It's the shape of my mouth? - I can tell when I look closely.

348
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:32,475
The fourth place goes to...

349
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:34,844
- It's "Jeon" right now. - Okay.

350
00:12:34,844 --> 00:12:36,545
(Chattering away)

351
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,281
(Moving his lips)

352
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,950
- It's "Jee". - It's "Jee" this time.

353
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:42,418
It's "Jee" right now.

354
00:12:42,418 --> 00:12:43,953
- I'll do it now. - Okay.

355
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:45,354
- Don't try to read me. - Okay.

356
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:46,555
"Don't try to read me."

357
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:47,790
- We can read him though. - The fourth place goes to...

358
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,358
(Which one will win over Kwang Soo's heart?)

359
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:50,960
- It's So Min. - It's "Jeon".

360
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,094
- Jeon So Min. - Yes!

361
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,798
(He was late.)

362
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:57,466
- I could tell it was "Jeon". - Yes.

363
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,469
(After a cutthroat battle, Seok Jin is placed 5th.)

364
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,105
- Right? It'd have hurt my pride. - Right.

365
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:04,807
I look forward to working with you.

366
00:13:05,174 --> 00:13:07,777
- I'm excited to work with you. - This is the result.

367
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,011
(Feeling satisfied)

368
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,246
Everyone must have felt it.

369
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:13,649
I thought hard and carefully about my decisions.

370
00:13:14,383 --> 00:13:16,419
I believe everyone is satisfied.

371
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:17,653
(Feeling proud)

372
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,956
(The order from top to bottom: Kwang Soo, Haha, Ji Hyo,)

373
00:13:20,956 --> 00:13:23,225
(So Min, Seok Jin, Se Chan, Jae Seok, and Jong Kook.)

374
00:13:23,526 --> 00:13:24,994
Do we have to stand in order?

375
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:27,363
(They set out to where their first mission will be held.)

376
00:13:27,363 --> 00:13:28,864
- Stand according to your ranks. - According to our ranks?

377
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:30,266
- Okay. - In respect to our ranks?

378
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:31,801
- I forgot about that. - Move.

379
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:33,669
- Go to the end. - My goodness.

380
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:36,539
Stand in accordance with how well you dress.

381
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,608
- I can't believe I'm below So Min. - Goodness, seriously. So Min.

382
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,211
- I hate that look on her face. - That's so annoying.

383
00:13:42,211 --> 00:13:44,447
- This is a great start. - All right.

384
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:46,916
The first mission to arrange the ranks is...

385
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,185
Quiz! Knowledge Is Power.

386
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,353
(Quiz! Knowledge Is Power)

387
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:52,988
- Okay! - It's a quiz.

388
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:54,523
- Jae Seok is great at quizzes. - Is it a quiz?

389
00:13:54,523 --> 00:13:56,492
- Well, this is great. - It's a quiz?

390
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:57,560
Let's go!

391
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,595
(On the other hand, their countenances grow grim.)

392
00:13:59,595 --> 00:14:02,331
Okay. Ji Hyo and Se Chan.

393
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:03,666
However,

394
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,502
depending on your ranks, the buzzers will differ.

395
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:09,972
(The buzzers are different for each rank.)

396
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,307
- Really? - The buzzers are different?

397
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,976
- It must be difficult to use them. - What good is having easy buzzers?

398
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:15,778
It's of no use if you can't answer them.

399
00:14:15,778 --> 00:14:17,813
You will ring each buzzer given to you.

400
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:20,683
Your ranks will be determined based on how fast you answer them.

401
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:22,585
(Thank goodness I'm in 1st place.)

402
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:25,154
However, among the eight of you,

403
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:27,656
there is an absolute member who knows...

404
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,025
- all the answers to the quizzes. - What?

405
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:31,460
- No way. - What?

406
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,362
- The member knows all the answers. - Hey!

407
00:14:33,796 --> 00:14:34,864
Who is it?

408
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:37,032
(One of us is the absolute member who knows all the answers?)

409
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,935
(A member has snuck into this battle of ranks.)

410
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,237
- What? - Who is it?

411
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:42,671
- This is unbelievable. - Hey.

412
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:44,507
(They have the same mission but different agendas.)

413
00:14:44,507 --> 00:14:46,942
- It's Kwang Soo. He has the look. - Who is it?

414
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,711
(When there's a spy, it's always Kwang Soo.)

415
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,146
- It's not me. - His reactions are a bit iffy.

416
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:51,413
- They were a bit off. - It's not me.

417
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,516
- It's not me. I'm serious. - He didn't show any reactions.

418
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:54,583
I'm telling you the truth.

419
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,552
Here we go again. I'm telling you. It's not me.

420
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:57,753
- It's not me. I'm serious! - It's you, isn't it?

421
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,088
- Mark my words. It's not me. - My gosh.

422
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,322
- My goodness. - It's really not me.

423
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,591
(He's always suspected first. Is he the absolute member?)

424
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:05,161
- I think it's Se Chan. - That's not true.

425
00:15:05,161 --> 00:15:07,062
- It's Se Chan. - Mark my words. It's not me.

426
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,431
(He seems particularly nervous today.)

427
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:11,167
- You look anxious today. - No, I'm not.

428
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:13,903
It's him.

429
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:16,472
After your mission, if you apprehend the absolute member...

430
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,274
through a vote,

431
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:22,511
the absolute member will be placed last and face the penalty.

432
00:15:22,511 --> 00:15:23,979
- Okay. - Let's arrest the spy.

433
00:15:24,313 --> 00:15:25,648
If you fail to apprehend the absolute member,

434
00:15:25,781 --> 00:15:27,883
the absolute member will be placed first.

435
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,084
(The absolute member will be in 1st place.)

436
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,188
- The member can change the ranks. - Again?

437
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,289
(The absolute member can change the ranks.)

438
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,924
We should be careful when trying to arrest the absolute member.

439
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,892
When we look at the difficulty level for the questions,

440
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,828
- we'll know if it's doable or not. - That's right.

441
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:41,997
- They'd go all red if it's wrong. - Go all red?

442
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:44,934
We'll start with an O-X quiz...

443
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:47,403
- to divide upper and lower ranks. - Okay.

444
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:48,637
- O-X quiz? - Yes, O-X quiz.

445
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:51,140
- I have a shot at this. - O-X quiz.

446
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:55,277
After hearing the question, stand behind the flags for your answers.

447
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:56,779
Here's the first question.

448
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:01,050
Cobras die when they bite their own tongues.

449
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,084
- What? - This question...

450
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,819
This question was on TV before. Hold on.

451
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,087
(I definitely know this question.)

452
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,522
Cobras die when they bite their own tongues?

453
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:07,756
(Everyone seems lost with the question.)

454
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:10,259
- Who? - This question was on TV before.

455
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,696
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo set out with big strides.)

456
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,864
(Both of them choose X.)

457
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:17,032
- Are you choosing, "no"? - Yes.

458
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,068
(Then I'll go over there.)

459
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:22,071
(It's better to go against Ji Hyo's answer on our show.)

460
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,872
(I'm getting good at solving quizzes nowadays.)

461
00:16:25,174 --> 00:16:26,208
This is a hard question.

462
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,643
(Meanwhile, So Min...)

463
00:16:27,643 --> 00:16:28,944
They have poison in their bodies.

464
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:30,045
(She trusts Ji Hyo and follows her to X.)

465
00:16:30,045 --> 00:16:31,780
Do they just not bite their tongues...

466
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,015
- although they die in the end? - I think they die.

467
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:35,517
How can they bite their tongues? They have teeth only on both ends.

468
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:37,486
- I gave this question on our show. - Do they not bite their tongues?

469
00:16:37,486 --> 00:16:38,787
(Do you remember that, Jae Seok?)

470
00:16:38,787 --> 00:16:40,222
- I gave this question on that show. - Right?

471
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,658
- I came up with this question. - You have 10 seconds.

472
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:44,159
- Here's a hint. - Right.

473
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:47,229
When vipers bite their tongues, they faint.

474
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,565
- They only faint? - They don't die, do they?

475
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,866
Hold on. Are cobras venomous?

476
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,002
- They're really venomous. - It's in their teeth.

477
00:16:53,002 --> 00:16:54,536
- It's not in their tongues. - They're venomous.

478
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,973
(Jae Seok and Haha choose O with 3 seconds left.)

479
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:00,309
Have you decided?

480
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:02,711
Was it in 2012? Or 2016?

481
00:17:03,012 --> 00:17:04,813
This question came up on one of my former shows.

482
00:17:04,813 --> 00:17:07,549
- I think Haha came up with this. - I came up with this one.

483
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:09,385
- Really? - You came up with this question?

484
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,686
- It was on Instagram. - I guess we're wrong.

485
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,921
- No, no. The answer is X. - How could they die?

486
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:15,624
- They're immune to their poison. - That's right.

487
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:17,092
- That makes no sense. - I'm 100-percent certain.

488
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:18,160
The answer is...

489
00:17:18,193 --> 00:17:20,129
(Members who answer it correctly will be in upper ranks.)

490
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:22,164
(And the other four will be in lower ranks.)

491
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:24,700
(What's the answer that will decide the upper and lower ranks?)

492
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,502
- The answer is "Yes". - That's right.

493
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:28,570
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Haha, and Se Chan are in upper ranks.)

494
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,205
- Okay! - Come on.

495
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:32,274
- They die? - Really? They die?

496
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,077
- They can die from that? - Cobras can die from it?

497
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,946
- All of us are smart enough for it. - I'm 100-percent certain.

498
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,716
- This is great. - How could you not know this?

499
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,751
- It's Se Chan. - It's one of them.

500
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:43,852
- Listen. - It has to be him.

501
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:45,654
I followed Jae Seok here.

502
00:17:45,654 --> 00:17:47,089
- You know the answer to this? - I'm certain of it.

503
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:48,657
He looks anxious.

504
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,225
- He seems nervous. - It was on TV.

505
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:53,662
Actually, on the last episode, Se Chan...

506
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:55,464
seemed pretty uneducated.

507
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,700
- Yang Chicken is his nickname. - He just got that reputation.

508
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,867
(Se Chan earned a new reputation.)

509
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:02,438
(On October 7, they found a shocking memo at his house.)

510
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:05,874
("Chicken" towel)

511
00:18:05,874 --> 00:18:11,513
(And Se Chan also misspelled "towel" in the following quiz.)

512
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,550
That's why the staff could have picked him for the absolute member.

513
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,618
- No, no. There's no way. - By the way, confusing "kitchen"...

514
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,986
- with "chicken" was terrible. - Right.

515
00:18:18,153 --> 00:18:19,788
Can you spell that now?

516
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:21,056
Of course, I can.

517
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:22,691
(Will Se Chan remember its spelling after 2 weeks?)

518
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:24,326
(Acting confidently)

519
00:18:24,426 --> 00:18:27,396
- Can you give us a notebook? - Let's see if he can spell it.

520
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:29,431
- I can do it. Come on. - Kitchen towel.

521
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,833
- I know it now. - It's been aired.

522
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,267
- Exactly. - Here we go.

523
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,602
Jong Kook...

524
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:35,204
Stop staring at me. You're making me nervous.

525
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:37,439
- Leave me alone. - Why would you be nervous?

526
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,741
Write while no one is watching.

527
00:18:38,741 --> 00:18:39,908
Kwang Soo, do you know how to spell it?

528
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,877
- Do you? - I do.

529
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:44,113
- Try it. - Try it.

530
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:46,281
- I feel offended. - Kitchen towel.

531
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,649
(Se Chan versus Kwang Soo, Spelling Bee)

532
00:18:48,117 --> 00:18:53,122
(They're more worked up about this than the real mission.)

533
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:55,023
Seok Jin, you should try it too.

534
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:56,825
- I know how to spell it. - Try it.

535
00:18:57,025 --> 00:18:58,994
I'm not going to write it wrong on purpose.

536
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,529
(How much knowledge do you have compared to the other members?)

537
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:01,730
Knowledge?

538
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:04,600
(Jee Seok Jin, self-claimed intellectual)

539
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,968
Seriously,

540
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,003
let me tell you the truth.

541
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,238
I'm the most knowledgeable one.

542
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:10,839
I'm number one.

543
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:13,275
Apart from me, everyone is on the same level.

544
00:19:14,443 --> 00:19:15,677
Should I reveal my answer first?

545
00:19:16,011 --> 00:19:17,112
- Should I? - Sure.

546
00:19:17,112 --> 00:19:18,981
Se Chan must have tried to memorize it.

547
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,250
I did. And it's still written on my fridge.

548
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,618
I'm confident.

549
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,054
"Kitchen towel".

550
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:27,556
Correct.

551
00:19:27,556 --> 00:19:29,358
- That's the correct answer? - Seok Jin.

552
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,826
Kwang Soo is wrong.

553
00:19:31,326 --> 00:19:32,494
Kwang Soo.

554
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,163
Is it okay to reveal it?

555
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,698
Kwang Soo wrote something else.

556
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:37,733
(What did he write?)

557
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:38,967
"Kitchyn tower".

558
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,703
(Wrong)

559
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:44,072
Tower?

560
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:45,574
- Tower? - Tower?

561
00:19:45,574 --> 00:19:47,543
"Kitchyn tower".

562
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:49,812
He wrote, "tower".

563
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,581
Let's see the most educated one's answer.

564
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,683
- Not many can write it. - Seok Jin is wrong too.

565
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,586
I'm the most knowledgeable one.

566
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:00,522
(He was confident when he said he was better than the others.)

567
00:20:00,522 --> 00:20:02,858
Seok Jin wrote "kitchen" wrong too.

568
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:04,526
- Is that wrong? - "CK"?

569
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:05,761
(He wrote "k" instead of "h".)

570
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,463
- Is it wrong? - Why did you write "k"?

571
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:10,199
"Kitcken".

572
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:11,533
(He wrote "kitcken" instead of "kitchen".)

573
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,001
- "Kitcken towel". - "Kitcken towel".

574
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:14,803
- What's the correct answer? - "Kitcken towel".

575
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:16,205
What's with you?

576
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:18,006
- You still don't know what's wrong? - I wrote "kitcken".

577
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,042
- This should be "h". - Oh, right.

578
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,243
Stop pretending.

579
00:20:21,243 --> 00:20:23,479
- He left out "towel". - It...

580
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,247
- Write "towel". - slipped my mind.

581
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:28,417
Seok Jin must be embarrassed.

582
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,586
"Oh, right. It slipped my mind."

583
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:32,354
It slipped your mind?

584
00:20:32,354 --> 00:20:33,555
(The spelling bee is over.)

585
00:20:33,655 --> 00:20:34,923
All right.

586
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:36,258
- It was "ch". - Okay.

587
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,594
The lower group will go first.

588
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,729
The upper group can watch.

589
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,030
What's that?

590
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:44,433
(That's our buzzer?)

591
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:45,467
They're plastic wraps.

592
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,303
To press the buzzer, you need to break through the wrap.

593
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,304
We have to break through it?

594
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,773
The layers of plastic wraps differ according to your ranks.

595
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,475
1st place gets 1 plastic wrap.

596
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:55,577
- Kwang Soo... - I can break it right away.

597
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:57,846
Ranks 2 to 4 get 2 layers.

598
00:20:58,113 --> 00:20:59,715
Ranks 5 to 7 get 3 layers.

599
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:01,383
Rank 8 gets 4 layers.

600
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,218
- 4 layers? - Did you get 4 layers?

601
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:04,586
Here's the question.

602
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,021
- It's a multiple-choice question. - Okay.

603
00:21:06,522 --> 00:21:11,226
Which of the following characters' names...

604
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,061
means "nosy"?

605
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:14,196
- Nosy? - Nosy?

606
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,498
Number one, Jerry.

607
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:17,733
- As in "Tom and Jerry"? - Jerry.

608
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,468
Number two, Goofy.

609
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,036
Number three, Snoopy.

610
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,070
It's hard.

611
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,572
Number four, Tom.

612
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,408
Number five, Donald Duck.

613
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,510
Number six, Mickey Mouse.

614
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,279
Which of them is nosy?

615
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:32,114
Isn't it clumsy?

616
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,182
(They have to press the buzzer first.)

617
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:38,120
(The 3-layer plastic wrap won't break.)

618
00:21:39,054 --> 00:21:41,990
(Neither will the 2-layer plastic wrap.)

619
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:44,860
We have to break through it.

620
00:21:45,661 --> 00:21:46,728
It's a character?

621
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:48,497
Answer.

622
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:50,933
(Kwang Soo's 1-layer plastic wrap breaks right away.)

623
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:54,436
(Their rankings are low,)

624
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:58,974
(but their faces deserve high rankings.)

625
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,243
(Let me say my answer.)

626
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:02,344
What are you doing?

627
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:04,546
Kwang Soo did it.

628
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:05,881
- Stop. It's over. - Kwang Soo gets the chance.

629
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:08,116
- Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo gets the chance. - Will you be okay?

630
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:10,018
- What's your answer? - It won't break.

631
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,188
Number five, Donald Duck.

632
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:14,856
(Does it mean "nosy"?)

633
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:16,692
I was going to say that too.

634
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:19,294
(Does it mean "nosy"?)

635
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:20,629
- It's wrong. - Answer.

636
00:22:20,996 --> 00:22:22,431
(Is it my turn?)

637
00:22:22,631 --> 00:22:24,533
- Answer. - You have to break a new one.

638
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,101
(You have to break plastic wraps again to answer.)

639
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:27,169
What?

640
00:22:27,469 --> 00:22:28,537
- You have to break a new one. - What?

641
00:22:28,537 --> 00:22:29,605
(Right away)

642
00:22:29,605 --> 00:22:30,639
Again?

643
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:31,740
(Let me try too.)

644
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,375
Answer.

645
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,377
Number six, Mickey Mouse.

646
00:22:35,377 --> 00:22:36,511
(Wrong)

647
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:38,380
Number two, Goofy. No?

648
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,514
Answer.

649
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:40,582
(So Min never gives up.)

650
00:22:40,582 --> 00:22:41,717
Number one, Jerry.

651
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,086
No? It's wrong?

652
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:46,521
Answer.

653
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:48,523
Number three, Snoopy.

654
00:22:48,523 --> 00:22:51,360
(Correct)

655
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:54,129
(Snoopy means "nosy".)

656
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,497
- Isn't he... - Why?

657
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:57,299
- Why is it Snoopy? - Kwang Soo is in fifth place.

658
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:59,935
Isn't he clumsy?

659
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:02,004
If the questions are this hard,

660
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:04,673
- we might have a chance. - We have a chance.

661
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:05,941
- You just have to guess. - I didn't know.

662
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:07,476
We have to remember that.

663
00:23:07,476 --> 00:23:10,412
- Right. - One of us knows all the answers.

664
00:23:10,412 --> 00:23:12,247
(The absolute member knows all the answers.)

665
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:17,653
(The absolute member is either in the lower group or the upper group.)

666
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:19,755
They said almost all the options.

667
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,390
- They really had no idea. - The absolute member isn't here.

668
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,424
It's not among us.

669
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:24,459
It's not among them?

670
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:25,894
Because...

671
00:23:25,894 --> 00:23:27,362
It's not me.

672
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:30,098
(Se Chan doesn't fit in the upper group.)

673
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:32,134
After about two wrong answers,

674
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:34,069
the absolute member would have wanted to say the correct one.

675
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:35,804
But they continued.

676
00:23:35,804 --> 00:23:37,472
- It must be among us. - Probably.

677
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,640
Right.

678
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,676
I think it's either Se Chan or Haha.

679
00:23:40,676 --> 00:23:42,044
- Right. - You'll see.

680
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:43,278
Keep an eye on us.

681
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:44,880
- Everything points to them. - Okay.

682
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,049
For this round, to press the buzzer,

683
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:49,618
you have to whistle with candies in your mouth.

684
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:50,719
I can't whistle.

685
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,821
The number of candies you get...

686
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,623
is in accordance with your rankings.

687
00:23:54,623 --> 00:23:55,857
Here's the question.

688
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:00,028
What does "Bbaengddae pants" mean in North Korean?

689
00:24:00,028 --> 00:24:02,397
- Bbaengddae? - I know what "bbaengko" is.

690
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,000
- Number one, hiphop pants. - Bbaengddae?

691
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,402
Number two, skinny jeans.

692
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,471
Number three, baggy pants.

693
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:11,540
Number four, jeans.

694
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,042
Number five, slacks.

695
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,144
Number six, leggings.

696
00:24:16,311 --> 00:24:17,713
(Ji Hyo puts the candies in her mouth.)

697
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,415
(She whistle right away.)

698
00:24:20,415 --> 00:24:21,650
Ji Hyo gets the chance.

699
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,151
Number four, jeans.

700
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,686
(She says the wrong answer.)

701
00:24:24,686 --> 00:24:26,088
Wrong?

702
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:27,155
(Numbers 4 and 5 are struggling to get the chance.)

703
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:28,523
- I have no idea. - Number five?

704
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:29,758
(Numbers 4 and 5 are struggling to get the chance.)

705
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,694
(He spits out a candy.)

706
00:24:34,296 --> 00:24:35,664
Give him one more!

707
00:24:36,164 --> 00:24:37,265
Give me one more.

708
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:39,868
- Shouldn't he put it back in? - Give me one more.

709
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,304
Give him one more.

710
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:44,239
Seok Jin has a small mouth.

711
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:47,442
Ji Hyo gets the chance.

712
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,311
Ji Hyo will say all the options.

713
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:50,579
Number two, skinny jeans.

714
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,514
(Ji Hyo succeeds easily and says the correct answer.)

715
00:24:52,514 --> 00:24:54,216
- Nice. - It's correct?

716
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:55,751
It means "skinny jeans"?

717
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:57,052
I thought so too.

718
00:24:57,052 --> 00:24:59,521
It's me and Seok Jin again.

719
00:24:59,821 --> 00:25:01,556
It's a competition between ranks 7 and 8.

720
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:02,958
Let's see who ends up at the bottom.

721
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:04,593
What's that?

722
00:25:04,593 --> 00:25:05,727
- What's that? - Is that a gag?

723
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,095
I can't do that.

724
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,630
- We have to blow it with our noses. - Okay.

725
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,066
(So Min has to blow up 1 bottle with her nose, and Seok Jin, 2.)

726
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:14,369
(Let me get ready.)

727
00:25:15,103 --> 00:25:17,472
You have a booger on your chin.

728
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:19,307
(Hold on.)

729
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,009
He has a huge booger on his chin.

730
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:23,111
Gosh, there's more.

731
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,112
(Something keeps coming out.)

732
00:25:24,112 --> 00:25:26,348
The tissue became so big after he blew his nose.

733
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:28,683
- What's in it? - Stop it.

734
00:25:28,683 --> 00:25:31,286
- Stop it. - Is it a treasure chest?

735
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:33,755
It looks like a pouch.

736
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:34,823
A nose pouch.

737
00:25:34,823 --> 00:25:36,124
How many nicknames do you have now?

738
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:37,592
Nose Pouch, Nostrils...

739
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:39,094
You should organize them.

740
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:40,195
Here's the question.

741
00:25:40,195 --> 00:25:41,963
Ranks 7 and 8 are left.

742
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,000
This word was coined by Shakespeare.

743
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,003
- It means... - What?

744
00:25:48,236 --> 00:25:50,038
"booty of a pirate".

745
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,342
- It's used by hiphop artists. - Right.

746
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,877
- Please say the answer. - I think I know.

747
00:25:55,877 --> 00:25:57,579
- I'm sure many people know. - Really?

748
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,748
Okay. I know this one.

749
00:25:59,748 --> 00:26:00,949
You have to blow up the bottle.

750
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,517
(Seok Jin is worked up.)

751
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,886
- Good. One is done. - Okay.

752
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:06,888
Swag.

753
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:09,090
(Correct)

754
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,859
(Seok Jin is in 7th place, and So Min, 8th.)

755
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:12,727
- So Min. - Okay.

756
00:26:13,595 --> 00:26:16,231
Why did you lose?

757
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:19,501
(5: Kwang Soo, 6: Ji Hyo, 7: Seok Jin, 8: So Min)

758
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:21,036
It's the upper group's turn.

759
00:26:21,036 --> 00:26:22,270
Okay.

760
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,905
- Move, lower group. - Okay.

761
00:26:23,905 --> 00:26:25,640
- Move. - Move.

762
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,875
- Move out of the way. - You punks.

763
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:29,678
We'll be able to find out now.

764
00:26:30,745 --> 00:26:31,947
Is that a gourd?

765
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,682
- What's that? - It's a gourd.

766
00:26:33,682 --> 00:26:34,783
(For this round, they are gourds.)

767
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:37,052
What are we supposed to do? You get only one?

768
00:26:37,118 --> 00:26:39,087
- It's not bad. - Good.

769
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:41,122
- I have an advantage. - That looks weak.

770
00:26:41,122 --> 00:26:42,157
Okay.

771
00:26:42,157 --> 00:26:43,825
It's not bad. I could do this.

772
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,261
For this round,

773
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,929
you have to break the gourds with your heads.

774
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,498
If you get this one right, you'll be in first place.

775
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:51,833
- First place. - Okay.

776
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,335
Let's do this!

777
00:26:53,335 --> 00:26:56,972
Back in elementary school, I even entered a math contest.

778
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,274
A dolphin has an organ...

779
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:03,078
that detects the direction and location of sounds.

780
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,679
(Haha gives up.)

781
00:27:05,247 --> 00:27:07,349
What's the name of it?

782
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,118
Number one, kiwi.

783
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,319
- Kiwi? - What?

784
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,854
Number two, melon.

785
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:15,056
Number three, grapes.

786
00:27:15,056 --> 00:27:16,758
Number four, apple.

787
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:17,826
- It's an organ? - What?

788
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:21,496
Number five, pineapple.

789
00:27:21,496 --> 00:27:23,531
(Se Chan breaks his gourd even before hearing everything.)

790
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:25,934
(He doesn't hesitate.)

791
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:27,936
- What's going on? - It's my turn.

792
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:29,304
Se Chan knows this?

793
00:27:29,304 --> 00:27:30,872
- He knows this? - What's the answer?

794
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:32,440
(Se Chan gets the chance right after the question is read.)

795
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,675
Number two, melon?

796
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:35,510
(He picks number 2, melon.)

797
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,849
(It's a difficult question. Is Se Chan's answer correct?)

798
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:42,684
Okay!

799
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,886
(Se Chan's answer is correct.)

800
00:27:44,886 --> 00:27:46,421
- He's the culprit. - No.

801
00:27:46,421 --> 00:27:47,889
Hold on. Listen.

802
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,824
He's the culprit.

803
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,927
Hold on. Listen.

804
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:53,895
We caught the absolute member.

805
00:27:53,895 --> 00:27:55,697
- Who are you trying to fool? - Hold on.

806
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:56,998
Listen.

807
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,600
- It doesn't make sense. - Listen.

808
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,668
He's the absolute member.

809
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:01,403
- Let's hear what he says. - Listen.

810
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:02,604
Don't make it so obvious.

811
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:03,838
- Don't make it so obvious. - You were too hasty.

812
00:28:03,838 --> 00:28:05,807
- A melon... - You were too hasty.

813
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:08,243
A melon has this.

814
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:10,045
- What do you mean? - What do you mean?

815
00:28:10,045 --> 00:28:11,246
The stem...

816
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:12,447
- I mean... - It doesn't make sense.

817
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:14,749
- No way. - It was a nonsense question.

818
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,685
(Frustrated)

819
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:17,886
- Gosh. - It's a nonsense question?

820
00:28:17,886 --> 00:28:20,722
- It wasn't. - It's not.

821
00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:22,123
(You're even more suspicious now.)

822
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:23,725
- It's not? - I hit Seok Jin too.

823
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:26,394
- I'm sorry. - Did you seriously guess?

824
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:27,562
- I did. - You did?

825
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:30,665
They told him, so he just answered back like a parrot.

826
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,734
First place is Se Chan.

827
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:34,736
Okay, it's not what you think.

828
00:28:35,036 --> 00:28:36,671
It's strange that Se Chan answered correctly.

829
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,373
- It's very strange. - Seriously.

830
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,542
- How could he? - All of them are similar...

831
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,011
- including apples. - Also,

832
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,680
he broke the gourd before anyone with such confidence.

833
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:47,549
He was in a hurry.

834
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:48,550
- He was. - He was waiting for it.

835
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,851
I should win.

836
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:52,087
- Here's the next question. - Let's go.

837
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,189
- The questions are difficult. - Just guess.

838
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,890
- My goal is Jae Seok. - Let's go.

839
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,891
(He wants to defeat Jae Seok.)

840
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:59,160
(Two big gourds? I'll break them easily.)

841
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:01,162
(I'll show you how intelligent I am.)

842
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:03,498
It's a short story by Joo Yo Seop.

843
00:29:03,898 --> 00:29:05,533
(What?)

844
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:07,969
(Joo Yo Seop?)

845
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,471
Darn it.

846
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:13,008
In his "Mother and a Guest",

847
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:16,177
how old is Ok Hee's mother?

848
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:19,014
- I can answer this. - Ok Hee's mother's age?

849
00:29:19,014 --> 00:29:23,718
Number 1, 20 years old. Number 2, 24 years old.

850
00:29:24,252 --> 00:29:28,289
Number 3, 27 years old. Number 4, 30 years old.

851
00:29:28,556 --> 00:29:30,392
Number 5, 33 years old.

852
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:31,626
Okay.

853
00:29:31,626 --> 00:29:33,862
(He breaks his gourd.)

854
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:35,063
Number 3, 27 years old.

855
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:40,769
(Jae Seok answers with confidence. Is 27 years old the answer?)

856
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:41,836
(Wrong)

857
00:29:41,836 --> 00:29:43,405
Number 2, 24 years old.

858
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:46,775
(He breaks two gourds.)

859
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,810
(Number 2, 24 years old)

860
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,211
Did he break them at once?

861
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:53,982
(Is Jong Kook's answer correct?)

862
00:29:53,982 --> 00:29:55,650
- Number 2, 24 years old. - 24 years old?

863
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,819
- Yes! - Goodness.

864
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,721
("My mother is 24 years old this year.")

865
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:00,755
26 years old?

866
00:30:01,256 --> 00:30:02,857
- That was strong. - Okay.

867
00:30:03,658 --> 00:30:05,660
(Disappointed)

868
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,530
Give Jong Kook a dog bowl. This is too easy for him.

869
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,098
(Gourds are too easy.)

870
00:30:10,098 --> 00:30:11,466
"Dog bowl"?

871
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:12,801
- "Dog bowl"? - Give him a metal bowl.

872
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,669
- Isn't it too weak for him? - Okay.

873
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:17,038
- What do you mean? - Give him a brass pot.

874
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,540
Give him an earthen pot.

875
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,208
Why did you take such a small gourd?

876
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:23,178
- It's mine. - Second place's gourd is small.

877
00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:25,080
Don't you know the rules?

878
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,581
- It's too small. - What?

879
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,717
That's why you're smaller than me.

880
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:31,553
(Even your gourd is smaller than mine.)

881
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:33,254
(What? I'm smaller?)

882
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:34,422
He got confident.

883
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:36,491
I don't know about that.

884
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,560
That's why you're smaller than me.

885
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,562
Let's get Jae Seok today.

886
00:30:40,562 --> 00:30:41,863
Here we go again.

887
00:30:41,863 --> 00:30:43,932
Here's the next question. It's a multiple choice.

888
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,233
Okay, I'll guess.

889
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:48,837
In the story of Buddha's birth...

890
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:49,904
Okay.

891
00:30:49,904 --> 00:30:53,074
When Buddha was born, this is what he shouted.

892
00:30:53,074 --> 00:30:55,510
- He shouted? - What did he say?

893
00:30:55,844 --> 00:30:57,579
- Did he shout when he was born? - When he was born?

894
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,080
- I've read it in a book. - Did he say something?

895
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,648
- Number one. - Baby sounds?

896
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:02,450
"Om mani padme hum."

897
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:05,820
That's right. I know this.

898
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,756
Number two, "Bodhisattva Mahasattva".

899
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:11,459
Number three, "Namo Amitabhaya".

900
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:15,096
Number four, "I am my own deity of the skies and earth."

901
00:31:15,196 --> 00:31:16,264
No way.

902
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,299
Number five, "All or nothing".

903
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,300
- What? - "All or nothing"?

904
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,102
Number six, "A big commotion".

905
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:22,203
By the way...

906
00:31:22,203 --> 00:31:25,173
(The choices are given, but they're hesitant.)

907
00:31:25,406 --> 00:31:28,243
It's difficult to say if it's number one.

908
00:31:30,078 --> 00:31:32,213
(The sound is loud, but it doesn't break.)

909
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:33,815
(It hurts so much.)

910
00:31:33,815 --> 00:31:35,383
- It didn't break. - Do it again.

911
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,885
It didn't break.

912
00:31:36,885 --> 00:31:38,353
(Haha gives it a try.)

913
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,988
What's the answer?

914
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:41,556
Number one.

915
00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:46,027
(Haha's answer is number 1.)

916
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:47,195
- What is it? - What is it?

917
00:31:47,262 --> 00:31:48,563
- What is it? - What is it?

918
00:31:49,531 --> 00:31:51,132
(Number 1...)

919
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:54,469
"Om baehon samsasam"?

920
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:57,038
What? He didn't pronounce it well.

921
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:58,106
He said something else.

922
00:31:58,106 --> 00:31:59,140
(He created a new phrase.)

923
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:00,375
I got it.

924
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,910
(He gives it a try.)

925
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:04,846
- Goodness. - What's the answer?

926
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,981
Number one, "Om mani padme hum."

927
00:32:06,981 --> 00:32:08,850
(He pronounces it correctly.)

928
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:13,988
(Jae Seok says it correctly. Is it the answer?)

929
00:32:13,988 --> 00:32:15,456
Did I pronounce it wrong?

930
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:16,891
(The answer is wrong.)

931
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:17,892
Wait.

932
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:19,093
(With the remaining choices,)

933
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:20,094
(he gives it another try.)

934
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:23,398
- The smaller one is worse. - Smaller ones are harder.

935
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:24,432
What's the answer?

936
00:32:24,432 --> 00:32:26,901
(What is Haha's answer?)

937
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,369
Hurry up.

938
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:31,206
Number four, "I am my own deity of the skies and earth."

939
00:32:31,206 --> 00:32:33,374
(He stammers the answer.)

940
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,976
Can you repeat it?

941
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:36,377
(Is it wrong once again?)

942
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:39,681
- What's wrong? - Tell him the answer, Se Chan.

943
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,915
I don't know.

944
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,350
Tell him the answer.

945
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,619
- Number four? - "I am my own deity."

946
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,087
(His answer is accurate this time.)

947
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:51,059
(Will his choice be correct?)

948
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,428
(Haha's answer is correct.)

949
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:55,730
(Screaming in happiness)

950
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:58,666
Why are you exaggerating your reaction?

951
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:00,201
Why not? I defeated Jae Seok.

952
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:01,636
- Are you that happy? - Yes.

953
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:03,671
What's wrong with being excited?

954
00:33:03,671 --> 00:33:05,640
- You aren't it, are you? - What's wrong with being excited?

955
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,308
- No. - No, right?

956
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:09,444
What's wrong with being excited?

957
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,112
It's Se Chan.

958
00:33:11,112 --> 00:33:12,614
Stop it.

959
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:14,449
Isn't it good to win first place?

960
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,651
Here's the order.

961
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:20,355
Here's the rank for the first round of Knowledge Is Power.

962
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,557
(Current order)

963
00:33:22,557 --> 00:33:26,461
Now, we'll vote for the absolute member.

964
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:29,631
Please vote for a member whom you think...

965
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:31,099
is the absolute member.

966
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,968
(If they succeed, the absolute member is ranked last.)

967
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:36,104
- I don't know. - Say something, Se Chan.

968
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:37,272
- Listen. - Why aren't you talking?

969
00:33:37,272 --> 00:33:38,840
- Why aren't you talking? - In terms of hierarchy,

970
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,174
which rank is the best?

971
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:42,176
- Listen, let me tell you. - Isn't it him?

972
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:46,247
You answered without listening to all the choices.

973
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,549
It means that you knew the answer.

974
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,519
- Listen. - He's strange too.

975
00:33:52,086 --> 00:33:53,788
(People suspect him all of a sudden.)

976
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:54,989
You're very strange.

977
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:56,624
Who are you? What's wrong with you?

978
00:33:56,624 --> 00:34:00,161
This is what detectives do.

979
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:02,563
Se Chan is the strongest candidate.

980
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:04,565
Se Chan looks quite tense.

981
00:34:04,565 --> 00:34:07,201
Didn't I tell you during the O-X quiz?

982
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:10,171
Certainly, Se Chan heard the conversation I had with Haha.

983
00:34:10,171 --> 00:34:12,607
That's probably why he answered that way.

984
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,810
However, it seemed like he acted with an intention.

985
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,111
(Did Se Chan plan to do it?)

986
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:22,050
(Before the last call, Se Chan changed his answer.)

987
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,854
(He follows Haha and Jae Seok as people suspect him.)

988
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:28,556
(Was Se Chan acting?)

989
00:34:28,556 --> 00:34:30,024
This is crazy.

990
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:34,295
Se Chan could have listened to all the choices before answering.

991
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:36,364
Number two, melon?

992
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:39,934
(Se Chan answered correctly before all the choices were said.)

993
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:44,038
(Usually, it's a difficult question for Se Chan to answer.)

994
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:48,409
It's strange that he guessed right after hearing four choices.

995
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,410
That's true.

996
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,914
- His explanation was... - I already said it, so stop it.

997
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:54,449
(Jae Seok cuts him off.)

998
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,050
Stay back.

999
00:34:56,351 --> 00:34:58,019
- All right. - He looks tense.

1000
00:34:58,019 --> 00:34:59,887
Think about the shape of a melon.

1001
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:02,557
You'll win first place like a fool...

1002
00:35:02,557 --> 00:35:04,058
- even if you're the absolute one. - Right.

1003
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,661
- "Like a fool"? Goodness. - You're a fool.

1004
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:08,796
Let's vote for the first rank.

1005
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:11,165
Okay. Let me look at their faces first.

1006
00:35:11,265 --> 00:35:13,134
This is what's strange.

1007
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,670
"Let me look at their faces first". That's strange.

1008
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,838
The answer, melon, was obviously strange.

1009
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:19,674
He didn't have to say anything, but he wanted to look at our faces.

1010
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:21,843
- "Let me look at their faces." - Goodness.

1011
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:23,044
You're today's absolute member.

1012
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:24,946
- This is insane. - It's you.

1013
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:26,514
"Let me look at their faces first."

1014
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,451
(Is Se Chan the absolute member as everyone predicts?)

1015
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:32,153
I don't know yet.

1016
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:34,789
I'll follow what I felt first.

1017
00:35:36,557 --> 00:35:38,459
Let's follow what we felt first.

1018
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:39,994
(Everyone suspects Se Chan.)

1019
00:35:39,994 --> 00:35:41,095
Yang Se Chan.

1020
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,565
This is difficult.

1021
00:35:44,565 --> 00:35:46,567
(Everyone finishes voting.)

1022
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,536
- All right. - Do we have the result?

1023
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:50,271
I'll announce the result.

1024
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:52,273
- The result is important. - Okay.

1025
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:55,510
Here's whom Ji Hyo voted.

1026
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,311
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Me?

1027
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,679
(Ji Hyo votes for Kwang Soo.)

1028
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:00,281
Is it Ji Hyo?

1029
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,250
It's not him.

1030
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,551
- Ji Hyo. - Why me?

1031
00:36:03,818 --> 00:36:06,521
- Se Chan's vote. - What on earth?

1032
00:36:06,654 --> 00:36:08,423
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Me?

1033
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:09,657
Kwang Soo?

1034
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:11,726
There's a team.

1035
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:13,861
- There's a team. - You're an assistant.

1036
00:36:13,961 --> 00:36:15,430
- No way. - You're an assistant.

1037
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,031
- I'm not. - You are.

1038
00:36:17,031 --> 00:36:19,934
Kwang Soo didn't do anything suspicious.

1039
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:21,969
I didn't do anything suspicious.

1040
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:25,006
- Here's whom Kwang Soo voted. - Let's hear it.

1041
00:36:25,473 --> 00:36:27,041
- Kim Jong Kook. - What?

1042
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,075
Did he?

1043
00:36:28,075 --> 00:36:29,210
(Kwang Soo votes for Jong Kook.)

1044
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:30,545
- What's going on? - Se Chan.

1045
00:36:30,545 --> 00:36:32,680
He acted suspiciously enough.

1046
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,348
You should have chosen Se Chan.

1047
00:36:34,348 --> 00:36:36,050
No one voted for him yet.

1048
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:38,519
The rest of you voted for Se Chan.

1049
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,021
- Right. - That's right.

1050
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:41,622
(The remaining 5 members voted for Se Chan.)

1051
00:36:41,622 --> 00:36:45,026
Wait, listen to me.

1052
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,527
Think about it.

1053
00:36:46,527 --> 00:36:49,197
When the question was given, I wanted to win first place.

1054
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:51,299
That's why I answered as quickly as possible.

1055
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:55,369
It's Se Chan, so it's Se Chan.

1056
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,805
Don't try to influence others.

1057
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,774
It's impossible that Se Chan won first place.

1058
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,611
Based on the results, the member with the most votes...

1059
00:37:03,644 --> 00:37:05,680
- is Se Chan. - That's right.

1060
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,881
(Se Chan gets the most votes.)

1061
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:10,017
For the arrest of the absolute member...

1062
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:14,822
(Did they succeed in arresting the absolute member?)

1063
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:16,557
Did we succeed?

1064
00:37:16,557 --> 00:37:17,792
(Did they succeed in arresting the absolute member?)

1065
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:18,960
You failed.

1066
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,562
(They failed to arrest the absolute member.)

1067
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,432
Why did you vote for me? I said I'm not.

1068
00:37:24,432 --> 00:37:26,901
(Is Se Chan not the absolute member?)

1069
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:29,871
(Then who could it be?)

1070
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,172
Did you really know the answer?

1071
00:37:31,172 --> 00:37:33,374
(Everyone is confused.)

1072
00:37:33,674 --> 00:37:34,942
The absolute member is...

1073
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:36,777
(The real absolute member)

1074
00:37:36,777 --> 00:37:38,045
It's Haha.

1075
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,448
(The absolute member is Haha.)

1076
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:42,617
- Really? - This is terrible.

1077
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:46,354
He's terrible. How could he do that?

1078
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:48,155
How is it possible?

1079
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:50,291
(Due to Haha's perfect acting,)

1080
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:53,027
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1081
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:54,028
(they fail to arrest the absolute member.)

1082
00:37:54,662 --> 00:37:57,632
Everyone is being interviewed on how they honestly feel.

1083
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:01,736
Haha, you know all the answers to the quiz.

1084
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:03,437
You're the absolute member.

1085
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:07,341
During the quiz mission, don't let others get suspicious of you.

1086
00:38:07,475 --> 00:38:10,444
- You must rank at least third. - Really?

1087
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:12,813
You succeed if you don't get arrested.

1088
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:13,948
(He had to avoid getting arrested.)

1089
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:17,285
The other members are being interviewed individually.

1090
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:20,254
Memorize the answers quickly and act like you don't know.

1091
00:38:20,421 --> 00:38:23,357
"What do dolphins use to detect sounds and directions?"

1092
00:38:23,357 --> 00:38:24,659
"Kiwi, melon, grapes, apples, pineapples".

1093
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:26,394
What do these have to do with it?

1094
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,463
"It's a short story by Joo Yo Seop."

1095
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,631
"How old is Ok Hee's mother?"

1096
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:32,633
She's only 24?

1097
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:33,901
How old is Ok Hee?

1098
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:35,970
If Ok Hee is six, how old was her mom...

1099
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,872
(I've never heard this before.)

1100
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:39,173
But they got married early back in the day.

1101
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,142
24, 24, 24.

1102
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:42,877
2, 4. 2, 4.

1103
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:46,581
24. 2, 4.

1104
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:49,350
"In the story of Buddha's birth..."

1105
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,052
"when Buddha was born, this is what he shouted."

1106
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,020
"Namo Amitabhaya"...

1107
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:56,857
"I am my own deity of the skies and earth."

1108
00:38:57,425 --> 00:38:59,627
It doesn't really make sense.

1109
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:03,864
It doesn't match the image of Buddhism.

1110
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:11,072
(To make it natural, he looked confident on purpose.)

1111
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,777
(He gave up on a question to avoid suspicion.)

1112
00:39:16,877 --> 00:39:20,181
(To fool Jae Seok, he mumbled his answer on purpose.)

1113
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:23,184
(Jae Seok fell for it and said the wrong answer.)

1114
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:27,822
(He won third place by saying the answer he already knew.)

1115
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:28,990
I'm sorry.

1116
00:39:29,757 --> 00:39:30,925
Good work.

1117
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:32,660
(Haha successfully completes his mission.)

1118
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,829
I wanted to say the correct answer right away.

1119
00:39:36,063 --> 00:39:38,933
- Couldn't you do any better? - What did you do?

1120
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,134
Why did you say, "melon"?

1121
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:41,902
(Why did I do so well today?)

1122
00:39:42,403 --> 00:39:45,406
Why did you have to say, "melon"?

1123
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:47,141
- Se Chan. - I mean...

1124
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:48,643
- Thank you. - When I said, "melon",

1125
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:50,978
I just took a guess.

1126
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:54,315
Why didn't you let me say anything? I kept denying it.

1127
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:55,549
But Jong Kook kept saying, "It's you."

1128
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,518
"You made a mistake, so pull yourself together."

1129
00:39:57,518 --> 00:40:01,422
I'm a fool? No, you're a fool. You shouldn't live like that.

1130
00:40:01,822 --> 00:40:04,925
I kept denying it. I denied it to the end.

1131
00:40:05,259 --> 00:40:06,627
- Gosh. - Sorry.

1132
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:09,263
Today's champion is Yang Se Chan!

1133
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,464
(They try to comfort him.)

1134
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:11,666
Toss him into the air.

1135
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:15,169
Se Chan even fooled himself.

1136
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:17,938
I mean, I just took a guess.

1137
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,840
I had no idea it would be Haha.

1138
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,275
Haha is...

1139
00:40:22,009 --> 00:40:23,444
in first place now.

1140
00:40:23,444 --> 00:40:25,579
- I'm not going to trust him. - He can decide...

1141
00:40:25,579 --> 00:40:27,148
- the other members' rankings. - Haha.

1142
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,949
- Haha. - Haha.

1143
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,651
I won't say much.

1144
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:31,886
Okay.

1145
00:40:31,886 --> 00:40:33,954
- I never suspected you. - Okay.

1146
00:40:34,055 --> 00:40:36,457
Some people suspected me.

1147
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:37,725
No one did.

1148
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:40,194
As soon as I beat Jae Seok,

1149
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:42,730
someone said, "You're suspicious."

1150
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,932
"Why are you so excited?"

1151
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:47,501
You did seem too excited.

1152
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:48,936
Kitcken.

1153
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:50,671
- Go to the back. - Why am I Kitcken?

1154
00:40:50,905 --> 00:40:52,640
- Go to the back. - Why am I Kitcken?

1155
00:40:52,773 --> 00:40:54,208
- Kitcken. - Go.

1156
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,876
- Come. - Move.

1157
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,178
Come here.

1158
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,080
Gosh.

1159
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,181
Move.

1160
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,882
- Come here. - Why am I in eighth place?

1161
00:41:01,882 --> 00:41:03,317
Stay here.

1162
00:41:03,317 --> 00:41:04,418
Also,

1163
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,754
as soon as Kitcken said that,

1164
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:09,724
someone agreed.

1165
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:11,125
Right.

1166
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:13,294
Ji Hyo.

1167
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:16,597
(Ji Hyo, go to the back.)

1168
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:18,699
- Ji Hyo. - I remember it clearly.

1169
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:20,000
I didn't know what to do.

1170
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,635
- Listen to him. - Go, Ji Hyo.

1171
00:41:21,635 --> 00:41:23,337
- Come to the back. - Hurry up.

1172
00:41:23,337 --> 00:41:24,672
- I mean... - Go.

1173
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:26,273
Also, I still remember this.

1174
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:27,441
From far away,

1175
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:30,077
as if to say, "Why are you there,"

1176
00:41:30,077 --> 00:41:32,346
- someone looked at me suspiciously. - That's right.

1177
00:41:32,346 --> 00:41:33,681
Please go to the back.

1178
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:36,984
(Jae Seok?)

1179
00:41:37,718 --> 00:41:39,220
- I think it's you. - You.

1180
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,221
Me?

1181
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:42,022
(It's you, Kwang Soo.)

1182
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:43,057
- Me? - Go.

1183
00:41:43,057 --> 00:41:44,625
Why me?

1184
00:41:44,658 --> 00:41:45,760
- Why? - Go.

1185
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,927
You looked at me like this.

1186
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,263
- You were a little suspicious. - Just go.

1187
00:41:49,263 --> 00:41:50,731
Just go.

1188
00:41:50,731 --> 00:41:52,533
Be quiet. Please be quiet, you three.

1189
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:54,668
I think you'll be here soon.

1190
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:57,638
- I have a question for Jae Seok. - Okay.

1191
00:41:57,638 --> 00:41:58,873
(Obedient)

1192
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:00,975
How many of the things you have are bigger than mine?

1193
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:04,311
(Well... Let me see.)

1194
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:05,913
(The size dispute begins again.)

1195
00:42:05,913 --> 00:42:08,449
Will he choose his pride?

1196
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:09,617
(Pride or ranking?)

1197
00:42:10,084 --> 00:42:13,988
(During the briefcase race, they received a controversial hint.)

1198
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,923
"It's bigger than Jae Seok's and smaller than Haha's."

1199
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:17,191
What?

1200
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:19,927
(And thus started the dispute regarding their sizes.)

1201
00:42:19,927 --> 00:42:21,595
I can definitely beat you.

1202
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:24,265
Haha, the camera.

1203
00:42:24,265 --> 00:42:25,499
What are you going to do?

1204
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,768
What is this?

1205
00:42:27,768 --> 00:42:29,737
(They competed to protect their pride.)

1206
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:31,038
I can't stand it.

1207
00:42:31,038 --> 00:42:33,340
Will he choose his pride?

1208
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:36,110
I'd say, none.

1209
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,213
(Determined)

1210
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,149
(He gives up his pride to get a high ranking.)

1211
00:42:42,149 --> 00:42:45,519
I'd say, none.

1212
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,754
He's confident.

1213
00:42:46,754 --> 00:42:49,290
That's pathetic.

1214
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:53,360
- I'd say, none. - Is this really necessary?

1215
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:54,895
Is this necessary?

1216
00:42:54,895 --> 00:42:55,930
(Do you have to do this?)

1217
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:57,631
- Let me ask you one more thing. - Okay.

1218
00:42:57,731 --> 00:43:00,534
Are you cute?

1219
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:03,470
- He is. - Yes!

1220
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,005
I think so.

1221
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:06,907
Come here.

1222
00:43:06,907 --> 00:43:08,909
- Really? - He passed.

1223
00:43:08,909 --> 00:43:10,644
- Thank you. - And...

1224
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:13,314
someone took my hand.

1225
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:14,882
I'm so thankful.

1226
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:16,817
- My partner, Jong Kook, come here. - Okay.

1227
00:43:17,084 --> 00:43:18,552
- Thank you. - I'm being very fair.

1228
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,754
- Just because he's your partner... - This is...

1229
00:43:20,754 --> 00:43:22,156
You're being unfair.

1230
00:43:22,256 --> 00:43:24,658
- Hold on. I... - Be quiet!

1231
00:43:24,758 --> 00:43:26,327
Be quiet!

1232
00:43:26,327 --> 00:43:27,995
Be quiet. Keep your mouth shut.

1233
00:43:28,596 --> 00:43:29,697
Be quiet.

1234
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:31,098
- Keep your mouth shut. - "Keep your mouth shut"?

1235
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:33,534
Look. Be quiet.

1236
00:43:33,634 --> 00:43:34,668
Be quiet.

1237
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,537
- Please give me fourth place. - These two...

1238
00:43:36,537 --> 00:43:37,872
- But... - To be honest, I...

1239
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:39,039
Right.

1240
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,308
Se Chan saved me.

1241
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:43,110
Think about how you got there.

1242
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:45,846
- Se Chan, come here. - Okay!

1243
00:43:45,846 --> 00:43:47,681
He did a great job.

1244
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,184
Are you a parrot on Haha's shoulder?

1245
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:51,752
He's so cute.

1246
00:43:51,852 --> 00:43:53,721
(I'm Haha's spokesperson.)

1247
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:55,823
So Min, switch with the cute guy.

1248
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:58,926
(I can't stand it anymore.)

1249
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:00,527
- Haha. - I can't take it anymore.

1250
00:44:00,628 --> 00:44:01,929
Jae Seok talks too much.

1251
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,163
It's driving me crazy.

1252
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:04,698
You made the right choice.

1253
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:05,766
- Haha. - I'm done.

1254
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,601
So Min didn't suspect me.

1255
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:08,969
Thank you.

1256
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:11,538
Gosh. I can't believe it.

1257
00:44:11,538 --> 00:44:12,606
(Jae Seok gets in trouble by talking too much.)

1258
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,676
Number 1 gets 8 badges, number 2 gets 7,

1259
00:44:15,676 --> 00:44:18,312
and number 8 gets 1.

1260
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:20,281
- Okay. - Unbelievable.

1261
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,650
It's shocking that I'm in fifth place after what I did.

1262
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,518
(It's shocking that I'm in 5th place.)

1263
00:44:25,552 --> 00:44:27,655
(He even gave up his pride.)

1264
00:44:27,655 --> 00:44:29,089
He gave up his pride.

1265
00:44:29,189 --> 00:44:30,257
He's cute.

1266
00:44:30,257 --> 00:44:31,792
"I'd say, none."

1267
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,094
I can't believe it.

1268
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:35,162
(It's time to have lunch according to their ranks.)

1269
00:44:35,162 --> 00:44:36,597
Gosh, it's ridiculous.

1270
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,432
Let's go have lunch.

1271
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:42,503
(Current ranking)

1272
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,571
I can't believe it.

1273
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:45,739
I'm sorry,

1274
00:44:46,206 --> 00:44:47,808
but I don't have much space here.

1275
00:44:47,808 --> 00:44:49,677
- Can you move over a little? - Sorry.

1276
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,211
If you sit over there...

1277
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,479
Go over there.

1278
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:54,515
- You should squeeze a bit more. - Here?

1279
00:44:54,515 --> 00:44:56,116
- We're already three people. - Squeeze.

1280
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:57,651
- Can't we sit 3 and 3? - Gosh.

1281
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,320
- Gosh. - We have more space now.

1282
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,689
See what happens if I win first place.

1283
00:45:01,689 --> 00:45:03,157
Win first place then.

1284
00:45:03,524 --> 00:45:04,658
Everyone.

1285
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:07,761
We prepared your favorite food.

1286
00:45:07,761 --> 00:45:10,264
Rice, beef radish soup, braised short ribs...

1287
00:45:10,397 --> 00:45:11,899
- There's meat. - It's Korean food.

1288
00:45:12,232 --> 00:45:13,434
I love beef radish soup.

1289
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,602
- Grilled ham... - I love it.

1290
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,438
and fried eggs.

1291
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:20,808
- There are only 8 portions. - 8 portions?

1292
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:22,309
But we're eight people.

1293
00:45:22,476 --> 00:45:26,080
You'll get your food in the order of your ranking.

1294
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:28,983
You can get as much food as you want.

1295
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:34,154
The last person can eat only the remaining food.

1296
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:35,990
(Only the remaining food?)

1297
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,558
Seok Jin will starve again.

1298
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:39,893
Please leave some for me.

1299
00:45:39,893 --> 00:45:42,296
- We have to eat. - We have to eat.

1300
00:45:42,296 --> 00:45:44,665
Haha, in first place, will go first.

1301
00:45:44,765 --> 00:45:46,133
- Okay. - Enjoy your lunch.

1302
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:47,501
Go, you liar.

1303
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:49,269
- You liar. - Go, you liar.

1304
00:45:49,837 --> 00:45:52,773
- We'll be fine. - What's that on his chest?

1305
00:45:52,773 --> 00:45:54,274
You'll be able to fill up your stomach.

1306
00:45:54,274 --> 00:45:55,476
Of course.

1307
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:57,244
I'm not looking forward.

1308
00:45:58,112 --> 00:45:59,279
Gosh.

1309
00:45:59,346 --> 00:46:00,714
Look how pretentious he is.

1310
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,950
- I want to kick him in the bottom. - Hurry up.

1311
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,885
- Gosh. - Your lower body looks great.

1312
00:46:04,952 --> 00:46:06,053
Your hips look great.

1313
00:46:06,553 --> 00:46:07,821
You're very flexible.

1314
00:46:08,355 --> 00:46:09,456
You're flexible.

1315
00:46:09,823 --> 00:46:11,225
(How much food will Haha get?)

1316
00:46:11,225 --> 00:46:12,359
Okay.

1317
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,031
I should get enough rice.

1318
00:46:17,031 --> 00:46:18,065
(8 portions)

1319
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:20,834
Other people should eat too.

1320
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:22,436
Let me just get this much.

1321
00:46:22,669 --> 00:46:25,105
Well... Oh, look at this.

1322
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,306
(Beef radish soup)

1323
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:27,875
All right.

1324
00:46:28,942 --> 00:46:30,811
The chunks are the best part.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1325
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:33,981
Look at this beef. This would be enough for a meal.

1326
00:46:34,748 --> 00:46:36,183
Beef radish soup.

1327
00:46:36,183 --> 00:46:37,551
He's taking all the chunks.

1328
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:39,520
- But he can't... - The bowl...

1329
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,021
take too much.

1330
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:42,356
(The others are watching him.)

1331
00:46:43,157 --> 00:46:44,324
Be reasonable.

1332
00:46:44,758 --> 00:46:46,060
Don't take too much.

1333
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,961
He's doing that on purpose.

1334
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:49,363
Hey!

1335
00:46:49,863 --> 00:46:52,433
- Don't go overboard. - He's taking all the beef.

1336
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,637
(Let me get some short ribs now.)

1337
00:46:56,703 --> 00:46:58,739
Two pieces?

1338
00:46:58,739 --> 00:47:00,074
That wouldn't be enough.

1339
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:01,909
That wouldn't do.

1340
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:03,277
(3 pieces out of 8)

1341
00:47:03,277 --> 00:47:05,546
One potato... Okay.

1342
00:47:05,546 --> 00:47:06,647
(3 short ribs and 1 potato)

1343
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:09,049
I love short rib patties.

1344
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:12,119
(2 short rib patties)

1345
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,221
2 fried eggs. Definitely.

1346
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:16,056
(Full)

1347
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,492
Haha is eating too much.

1348
00:47:18,492 --> 00:47:20,961
- He's going overboard. - He's too greedy.

1349
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:23,764
My goodness. I love this.

1350
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:26,667
(2.5 grilled hams)

1351
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,302
(1 more grilled ham)

1352
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:30,671
It still doesn't look enough.

1353
00:47:31,171 --> 00:47:33,640
So Min.

1354
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,509
- You can't do that. - So Min.

1355
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:37,511
(Let me go get my food.)

1356
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:39,313
You didn't get any questions right.

1357
00:47:39,313 --> 00:47:40,681
So Min, don't go overboard.

1358
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:43,584
So Min, be reasonable.

1359
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:47,354
(So Min is never reasonable.)

1360
00:47:47,354 --> 00:47:48,789
I love grilled ham.

1361
00:47:50,757 --> 00:47:52,993
(3 grilled hams)

1362
00:47:52,993 --> 00:47:54,661
(Beans in soy sauce are my favorite.)

1363
00:47:57,397 --> 00:47:59,099
- So Min. - Yes?

1364
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,400
Did you leave a lot?

1365
00:48:01,802 --> 00:48:03,237
Yes. There's still a lot left.

1366
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,339
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1367
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,407
(She leaves 6 beans.)

1368
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:10,077
(So Min is done.)

1369
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:11,712
I want fried eggs.

1370
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:13,380
(It's number 3, Jong Kook's turn.)

1371
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,615
This...

1372
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:16,350
I love this.

1373
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:18,118
(He likes grilled ham.)

1374
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:20,787
They took so much. Were there 8 in the beginning?

1375
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:23,490
They took so much.

1376
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:26,193
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1377
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:28,629
(He cuts it.)

1378
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:30,464
(He divides the rest into 5 pieces.)

1379
00:48:30,464 --> 00:48:31,565
It's based on the number of people.

1380
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,834
(The three members took a lot.)

1381
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,903
I like beans in soy sauce.

1382
00:48:36,937 --> 00:48:39,173
(They eat generous portions.)

1383
00:48:40,007 --> 00:48:41,441
I need to serve myself a lot.

1384
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:42,876
(I'll take all.)

1385
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,879
Hey, hey.

1386
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:47,681
- Don't take too much. - Come on.

1387
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:48,682
Hey!

1388
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:49,850
How can you take all the solids?

1389
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:52,019
If you take all, what's left for us?

1390
00:48:52,986 --> 00:48:55,022
Just take one. Good.

1391
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:57,257
(He takes another one.)

1392
00:48:58,192 --> 00:49:00,027
Take only one.

1393
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,995
Show me your crab leg dance.

1394
00:49:01,995 --> 00:49:02,996
(If so...)

1395
00:49:02,996 --> 00:49:05,098
Fine, let me go.

1396
00:49:05,933 --> 00:49:07,768
(Dancing)

1397
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:09,369
- Jae Seok. - Why do you live like this?

1398
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,438
You have no sense of pride.

1399
00:49:12,072 --> 00:49:13,440
(Very satisfied)

1400
00:49:13,607 --> 00:49:15,542
(Give me one egg.)

1401
00:49:15,742 --> 00:49:17,544
Okay, I accept it.

1402
00:49:18,512 --> 00:49:20,714
At least, one egg remains.

1403
00:49:20,714 --> 00:49:21,949
(He gets one fried egg.)

1404
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:24,785
He's taking it whole. Jae Seok, split it.

1405
00:49:25,185 --> 00:49:26,253
Hey.

1406
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:28,021
He'll get to eat though.

1407
00:49:28,021 --> 00:49:29,389
(All the protein is gone.)

1408
00:49:29,389 --> 00:49:30,958
My goodness.

1409
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:32,526
Jae Seok!

1410
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:33,860
(He takes all the remaining soup.)

1411
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,129
- You'll drop it anyway, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1412
00:49:36,964 --> 00:49:38,599
What are you doing?

1413
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:40,400
I trusted him.

1414
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:43,103
I have no choice but to eat two.

1415
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,440
- Leave us some kimchi. - Kimchi.

1416
00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:48,709
There's nothing to eat.

1417
00:49:51,178 --> 00:49:53,447
Yes, Kwang Soo didn't take his soup.

1418
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:56,250
- I'm going in. - He didn't take his soup.

1419
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,651
(Ji Hyo goes in before Kwang Soo realizes it.)

1420
00:49:57,651 --> 00:50:00,020
(She goes straight to the soup.)

1421
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,788
Give me one soup.

1422
00:50:01,955 --> 00:50:03,123
Give me one.

1423
00:50:03,657 --> 00:50:06,059
(She takes it at the speed of light.)

1424
00:50:06,059 --> 00:50:07,294
I forgot my soup.

1425
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:10,430
I served one for myself.

1426
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:11,798
You didn't take it, so it's mine.

1427
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:12,966
I didn't leave it.

1428
00:50:13,033 --> 00:50:14,701
- It's mine now. - Wait.

1429
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:16,536
- I forgot to take it. - No way.

1430
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:17,771
Seriously.

1431
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,107
What do you mean? I served it myself.

1432
00:50:20,107 --> 00:50:22,476
- You didn't take it. - I did take it.

1433
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:24,611
- No, you didn't. - This isn't yours, right?

1434
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:25,712
That's not mine.

1435
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,715
Wait, I forgot to take it.

1436
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,452
(He served the soup for others.)

1437
00:50:32,853 --> 00:50:34,221
I didn't expect much.

1438
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:35,422
There's nothing.

1439
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:36,823
There's absolutely nothing.

1440
00:50:36,823 --> 00:50:38,191
(The empty trays welcome him.)

1441
00:50:38,191 --> 00:50:39,526
There's only rice.

1442
00:50:40,294 --> 00:50:41,528
I'll take all the rice.

1443
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,069
(He smears his rice with the sauce.)

1444
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:51,805
(He gets all the remaining sauce.)

1445
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:59,579
(He takes as much of the remaining side dishes as possible.)

1446
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:02,549
I got something at least.

1447
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:05,285
- Can we eat? - Thank you for the food.

1448
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:07,120
Enjoy your food.

1449
00:51:07,621 --> 00:51:08,789
What's this?

1450
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:10,190
Do we go through the doors?

1451
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,391
What are these?

1452
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:13,093
My goodness.

1453
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,028
- What's this? - Gosh.

1454
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:16,296
What is it?

1455
00:51:16,463 --> 00:51:19,566
Before you proceed your second mission,

1456
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,636
you'll rearrange the rank.

1457
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:24,871
You'll receive benefits based on the rank.

1458
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,039
(Rearranging the rank)

1459
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:27,841
- Okay. - Already?

1460
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:29,009
Okay.

1461
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:32,479
Spin the roulette and call the person's friend.

1462
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,081
Ask for his rank.

1463
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:35,382
- I see. - Let's try.

1464
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:36,650
Please spin the roulette.

1465
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,751
That sounds good.

1466
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:39,386
I'll spin it.

1467
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:40,821
(Call a close friend.)

1468
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:42,489
(Asking helpful questions is important.)

1469
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:44,791
- Please let it be him. - I should be first in rank.

1470
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,026
- I want to rank first. - Please.

1471
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:47,527
Let it be me.

1472
00:51:48,028 --> 00:51:49,629
It's definitely me.

1473
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:51,198
- It's me. - Here it is.

1474
00:51:51,198 --> 00:51:52,332
(Seok Jin is unlucky.)

1475
00:51:52,332 --> 00:51:54,901
(Did he really get selected?)

1476
00:51:55,702 --> 00:51:56,870
- Is it Seok Jin? - It's me.

1477
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,271
- Is it Ji Hyo? - It's me.

1478
00:51:58,705 --> 00:51:59,773
It's me.

1479
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,274
She's so lucky.

1480
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:03,744
(As always, lucky Ji Hyo is selected.)

1481
00:52:03,744 --> 00:52:05,312
- Whom should I call? - Whom should she call?

1482
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:07,881
There are people Ji Hyo is working with on a program.

1483
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:09,383
Shall I call Yoon Ju?

1484
00:52:09,383 --> 00:52:10,417
Call Jang Yoon Ju.

1485
00:52:10,417 --> 00:52:11,685
(That's a must.)

1486
00:52:11,685 --> 00:52:13,887
- "Haha". - "Jae Seok".

1487
00:52:13,987 --> 00:52:15,655
It's been a while since she called me by my name.

1488
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:16,957
It's been a while.

1489
00:52:16,957 --> 00:52:19,559
(It also benefits Jae Seok and Haha since he's close to her.)

1490
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,795
- Ji Hyo. - Yoon Ju.

1491
00:52:21,795 --> 00:52:23,430
(She answers the phone.)

1492
00:52:23,597 --> 00:52:26,400
- Hello. - I'm at a shoot.

1493
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,968
Say hello to her.

1494
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:29,770
Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.

1495
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,371
This is Haha.

1496
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:33,340
- It's been a long time. - Yoon Ju.

1497
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,841
Jae Seok.

1498
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:37,944
- "Jae Seok". - Yoon Ju.

1499
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:42,015
I get to hear your voice through Ji Hyo's call.

1500
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:44,418
You're right, Jae Seok.

1501
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:45,986
- Where are you? - It's been awhile.

1502
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:48,121
I'm at a shoot too.

1503
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:50,724
Is that so? You must be busy then.

1504
00:52:50,724 --> 00:52:53,193
I'm free for a little bit.

1505
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:54,227
Is it okay?

1506
00:52:54,227 --> 00:52:56,263
Ji Hyo will ask you a question.

1507
00:52:56,263 --> 00:52:58,632
You have to decide a rank.

1508
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,734
- Rank us based on what you hear. - Be honest.

1509
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:02,102
Be objective and fair.

1510
00:53:02,102 --> 00:53:04,805
You have to be really honest, Yoon Ju.

1511
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:07,707
This is what I think.

1512
00:53:07,707 --> 00:53:10,710
(What will Ji Hyo's question be?)

1513
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:15,482
(I hope it's a question that's favorable to me.)

1514
00:53:15,482 --> 00:53:17,150
Rank Running Man members based on their looks.

1515
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:18,652
(I can rank 1st.)

1516
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:21,388
- "Based on looks"? - Based on looks.

1517
00:53:21,388 --> 00:53:23,056
Remember, Yoon Ju.

1518
00:53:23,056 --> 00:53:24,891
- Rank us from 1st to 8th. - Be nice.

1519
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:27,027
First in rank is Ji Hyo.

1520
00:53:27,027 --> 00:53:28,361
- Yes. - Right.

1521
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:29,429
- I rank first. - I agree.

1522
00:53:29,429 --> 00:53:30,864
Who ranks second?

1523
00:53:30,864 --> 00:53:33,333
- Hello, Yoon Ju. This is So Min. - Hello, I'm Kwang Soo.

1524
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,235
(Do you hear me, Yoon Ju?)

1525
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:38,905
- So Min? - So Min ranks second.

1526
00:53:38,905 --> 00:53:40,173
Yoon Ju.

1527
00:53:40,173 --> 00:53:41,908
- Yoon Ju. - What about me?

1528
00:53:42,075 --> 00:53:44,478
- Who ranks third? - The one who ranks third...

1529
00:53:44,478 --> 00:53:45,645
Say my name.

1530
00:53:45,645 --> 00:53:47,481
My heart flutters when I see Jong Kook.

1531
00:53:47,481 --> 00:53:50,183
(It's big news.)

1532
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:52,552
Me? Thank you.

1533
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:54,488
- How? - Thank you.

1534
00:53:54,488 --> 00:53:55,622
Thank you.

1535
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:57,657
- Exclude glasses. - I'll do my best!

1536
00:53:57,657 --> 00:53:59,559
Judge them without their glasses on.

1537
00:53:59,659 --> 00:54:01,127
- Imagine us naked. - Yoon Ju.

1538
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:04,164
Yoon Ju, you have to remember me.

1539
00:54:04,164 --> 00:54:06,600
- Yoon Ju. - Remember Se Chan.

1540
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,535
I get upset easily.

1541
00:54:08,535 --> 00:54:10,804
- Wait. - Don't say anything.

1542
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:12,739
- Next is Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1543
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:15,041
(She ranks Kwang Soo 4th.)

1544
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,710
Does Kwang Soo rank fourth?

1545
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:19,579
- Next has to be me. - Which members remain?

1546
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:20,714
Seok Jin.

1547
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,282
- Se Chan. - Haha.

1548
00:54:22,282 --> 00:54:23,383
There's Haha.

1549
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:25,418
- Think of us without glasses. - Wait.

1550
00:54:25,418 --> 00:54:28,021
- Seriously. - Haha is low in rank.

1551
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:29,055
Really?

1552
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,058
(Haha is low in rank.)

1553
00:54:32,058 --> 00:54:34,261
- Go away. - You're low in rank too.

1554
00:54:34,661 --> 00:54:36,096
- Yoon Ju. - Seriously.

1555
00:54:36,096 --> 00:54:38,031
I finally get to make my revenge.

1556
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,966
I remember what happened on "Infinite Challenge".

1557
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:41,701
She remembers what happened.

1558
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,837
- How could you? - On "Infinite Challenge"?

1559
00:54:43,837 --> 00:54:46,406
- Say Seok Jin. - Se Chan ranks fifth.

1560
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:47,674
- He ranks fifth. - Okay.

1561
00:54:47,674 --> 00:54:49,009
I'm higher than him.

1562
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:51,011
- Come on, Yoon Ju. - Come on.

1563
00:54:51,011 --> 00:54:53,113
- Don't do this. - You're unbelievable.

1564
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:55,215
I understand that you're trying to be funny.

1565
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:58,552
I think Seok Jin ranks sixth.

1566
00:54:58,552 --> 00:54:59,753
- Sixth? - Goodness.

1567
00:54:59,753 --> 00:55:01,221
I don't even feel good.

1568
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:03,990
Yoon Ju has no respect for the two of us.

1569
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,559
She takes it so seriously.

1570
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:07,494
- You're right. - Yoon Ju, wait.

1571
00:55:07,494 --> 00:55:09,262
- It doesn't matter who wins. - I'll try to understand.

1572
00:55:09,262 --> 00:55:10,597
This is about looks.

1573
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:12,232
- Right. - Without glasses...

1574
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,434
- With glasses. - Without glasses.

1575
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:16,269
My answer is...

1576
00:55:17,304 --> 00:55:21,007
(Who...)

1577
00:55:21,007 --> 00:55:22,242
(Who is uglier?)

1578
00:55:22,242 --> 00:55:23,677
Jae Seok ranks eighth.

1579
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:25,378
Okay, thank you.

1580
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:27,681
(Jae Seok is the ugliest.)

1581
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:30,684
Listen, Yoon Ju.

1582
00:55:30,784 --> 00:55:32,852
- Congratulations. - Come on, Yoon Ju.

1583
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:35,055
He dresses badly, and he's ugly.

1584
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,290
- He's the worst kind. - I like you.

1585
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,625
- Yoon Ju. - He's the worst.

1586
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,226
Come on, Yoon Ju.

1587
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:42,429
You finished ranking all of us.

1588
00:55:42,429 --> 00:55:44,464
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1589
00:55:44,464 --> 00:55:46,199
- Thank you, Yoon Ju. - Thank you.

1590
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:52,472
(Current ranking)

1591
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:55,442
Listen. From the fourth rank...

1592
00:55:55,442 --> 00:55:56,610
Come to the back.

1593
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:59,746
Yoon Ju judged us accurately.

1594
00:55:59,746 --> 00:56:02,148
- Seriously. - I didn't think she'd be serious.

1595
00:56:02,148 --> 00:56:03,316
To be honest,

1596
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:04,851
she was trying to be funny from here.

1597
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:06,953
- That's right. - She was serious.

1598
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:08,622
I thought about it.

1599
00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:10,290
How dare you, you ugly?

1600
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,591
I thought about it.

1601
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:13,693
(He steps on his foot.)

1602
00:56:13,693 --> 00:56:15,261
How dare you, you ugly?

1603
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:16,763
You stepped on my foot.

1604
00:56:16,763 --> 00:56:18,365
(How dare you step on my foot?)

1605
00:56:18,365 --> 00:56:19,766
Goodness.

1606
00:56:20,467 --> 00:56:22,102
Get away from me!

1607
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:25,071
- He's ugly and dresses badly. - He dresses badly.

1608
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:26,473
On top of that,

1609
00:56:27,007 --> 00:56:29,909
- he agreed that he's not big. - Right.

1610
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,745
Isn't that right?

1611
00:56:31,745 --> 00:56:33,613
- Listen. - Jae Seok.

1612
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:34,648
Stay out of it.

1613
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:38,218
The second mission is Break the Wall to the Future.

1614
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:42,288
Behind eight styrofoam doors,

1615
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:44,524
there are six mattresses...

1616
00:56:45,025 --> 00:56:47,794
and two obstacles.

1617
00:56:48,028 --> 00:56:49,029
(Mud and water)

1618
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:51,197
- Goodness. - They're mud and water.

1619
00:56:51,197 --> 00:56:52,332
Oh, no.

1620
00:56:52,332 --> 00:56:54,901
Break the wall randomly.

1621
00:56:55,101 --> 00:56:56,903
You're eliminated if you get an obstacle.

1622
00:56:57,537 --> 00:56:59,906
Two members are eliminated in each round.

1623
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:03,810
Mud bath is ranked lower than water.

1624
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,211
Goodness, that's right.

1625
00:57:05,445 --> 00:57:09,816
However, there's an absolute member who knows which wall stands...

1626
00:57:09,816 --> 00:57:11,751
- before the obstacles. - Again?

1627
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:12,886
(There's one absolute member.)

1628
00:57:13,853 --> 00:57:14,921
Who is it?

1629
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:16,990
Who is it? Say it.

1630
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,359
After the mission is over,

1631
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,094
you may arrest them based on voting.

1632
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:23,363
- There must be a mission. - Of course.

1633
00:57:23,363 --> 00:57:25,265
Do we have to rank within the top three?

1634
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:27,267
Or you must fall in a mud bath.

1635
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,069
That could be true.

1636
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,037
We'll have to see.

1637
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:34,808
Based on the rank that Yoon Ju decided,

1638
00:57:35,575 --> 00:57:38,078
you'll be given shoes.

1639
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:39,679
These are shoes based on your ranking.

1640
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:42,449
- First rank is aqua shoes. - That's nice.

1641
00:57:42,749 --> 00:57:44,984
2nd to 4th in rank are given heels.

1642
00:57:45,685 --> 00:57:47,921
5th to 7th in rank are given flippers.

1643
00:57:48,254 --> 00:57:49,989
The last in rank...

1644
00:57:50,123 --> 00:57:52,158
- is given acupressure slippers. - That's harsh.

1645
00:57:52,258 --> 00:57:54,694
Come on. He's already sad to be ugly.

1646
00:57:54,994 --> 00:57:57,464
Take your pair of shoes.

1647
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:59,399
- Stand in your place. - What on earth?

1648
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:03,837
(Aqua shoes, heels, flippers, and acupressure slippers)

1649
00:58:03,837 --> 00:58:05,171
- I choose number 7. - 7?

1650
00:58:05,171 --> 00:58:06,740
- I choose number 7. - I choose number 2.

1651
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,110
We will break one of the doors.

1652
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,546
In this round, you choose based on 1st come, 1st serve basis.

1653
00:58:14,247 --> 00:58:15,415
Isn't this it?

1654
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:16,583
He's going far.

1655
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,718
- Get ready. - I'm not it.

1656
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:20,420
Go.

1657
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,588
(Which wall will he break?)

1658
00:58:21,588 --> 00:58:22,589
- What? - Now...

1659
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:24,023
I picked number seven.

1660
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:27,627
- I'm standing in front of it. - What was that?

1661
00:58:27,694 --> 00:58:29,696
- I chose seven. - Get ready...

1662
00:58:29,696 --> 00:58:31,397
- Do we run towards this? - One...

1663
00:58:31,397 --> 00:58:32,766
We can run towards it, right?

1664
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,267
- Can we go to seven? - We can run towards it.

1665
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:36,369
- We have to go to seven. - Hold on.

1666
00:58:36,369 --> 00:58:38,004
- Hold on. - One...

1667
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:39,405
(Inching towards 7)

1668
00:58:39,806 --> 00:58:41,541
1, 2...

1669
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,377
(Number 7 is a safe zone. If they get to it, they move on.)

1670
00:58:44,377 --> 00:58:46,170
1, 2...

1671
00:58:46,179 --> 00:58:49,415
(Number 7 is a safe zone. If they get to it, they move on.)

1672
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:50,617
(They sprint towards 7.)

1673
00:58:50,617 --> 00:58:52,352
The soles of my feet are so painful.

1674
00:58:52,986 --> 00:58:54,053
I don't even know.

1675
00:58:54,053 --> 00:58:56,289
(This is a mess.)

1676
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:57,791
What's this?

1677
00:58:57,924 --> 00:58:59,058
(Kwang Soo was standing in front of 7.)

1678
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:00,560
(He goes straight to it.)

1679
00:59:01,728 --> 00:59:04,731
(On either side of 7 are Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.)

1680
00:59:05,932 --> 00:59:10,403
(Number 4 and 5 are the obstacles.)

1681
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:13,807
- Here. - I'm safe.

1682
00:59:14,207 --> 00:59:15,542
- I'm safe. - I'm safe.

1683
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:18,945
- So Min. - Look.

1684
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:20,880
(So Min breaks through the wall with her face...)

1685
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,017
(and falls into the water in number 5.)

1686
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:29,522
(That was a powerful dive.)

1687
00:59:29,522 --> 00:59:30,924
It's Jong Kook.

1688
00:59:31,324 --> 00:59:34,360
(Jong Kook gets showered in mud as he falls into 4.)

1689
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,197
It's Jong Kook. He fell!

1690
00:59:37,897 --> 00:59:38,998
- I'm safe. - I'm good.

1691
00:59:38,998 --> 00:59:41,167
(Some are happy, some are sad.)

1692
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:44,537
What's this?

1693
00:59:44,537 --> 00:59:46,406
(He doesn't know where to go.)

1694
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,143
- I'm safe. - I'm safe.

1695
00:59:50,176 --> 00:59:51,845
- Yes! - I'm safe!

1696
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,479
The soles of my feet hurt.

1697
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,215
I'm done.

1698
00:59:55,215 --> 00:59:56,516
(He was supposed to be invincible.)

1699
00:59:56,916 --> 00:59:59,285
I was wrong.

1700
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:03,423
Jong Kook is in 8th place, and So Min is in 7th.

1701
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:06,259
- One of us knows then. - Right.

1702
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:07,727
- One of us? - It has to be.

1703
01:00:07,727 --> 01:00:08,828
I'm sure.

1704
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:12,065
I was the last one left.

1705
01:00:12,265 --> 01:00:13,533
Really?

1706
01:00:13,533 --> 01:00:15,335
(Seok Jin says he wandered around and went to an empty door.)

1707
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:17,570
But she went to number five.

1708
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,805
(Hold on.)

1709
01:00:18,972 --> 01:00:21,608
I think Seok Jin is suspicious...

1710
01:00:21,608 --> 01:00:24,344
because I asked where he was going in the beginning,

1711
01:00:24,344 --> 01:00:27,447
and he stood in front of number six.

1712
01:00:27,447 --> 01:00:29,048
- He didn't say anything. - He didn't move either.

1713
01:00:29,048 --> 01:00:32,619
So Min wanted to switch with him, but he kept on insisting he'd stay.

1714
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:36,522
He would usually ask me to switch, but he didn't say one word.

1715
01:00:36,522 --> 01:00:37,724
(There are several testimonies.)

1716
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,994
(Seok Jin was standing in front of 6.)

1717
01:00:40,994 --> 01:00:44,831
(So Min wanted to switch...)

1718
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:45,832
- It's her. - You're acting weird.

1719
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:49,035
(He pushed So Min towards 5 which was water.)

1720
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,038
(What's up with Seok Jin?)

1721
01:00:52,105 --> 01:00:53,206
- I'm going to stay here. - No.

1722
01:00:53,206 --> 01:00:56,075
(Did he know 5 was water?)

1723
01:00:56,075 --> 01:00:57,277
That's right.

1724
01:00:57,277 --> 01:00:58,811
- I had a gut feeling. - He always asks to switch.

1725
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:00,046
He does.

1726
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:03,816
That's true. He always asks to switch.

1727
01:01:03,816 --> 01:01:07,120
I thought there was a good possibility,

1728
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,522
and I didn't want to switch.

1729
01:01:09,522 --> 01:01:11,257
Do you always wear your shirt that way?

1730
01:01:11,257 --> 01:01:12,558
(What's wrong with his sleeves?)

1731
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:15,261
- No. - You must be sweaty.

1732
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:16,429
- No, no. - You're wiping it off.

1733
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:18,431
- I'm not. - That was unnatural.

1734
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:20,733
It doesn't matter what the situation is.

1735
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:22,101
If I get suspected, I act weirdly.

1736
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:23,636
I'm going to write your name,

1737
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:25,905
but I don't know if it's you. I'm writing your name regardless.

1738
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:27,473
It's not me.

1739
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:29,142
I won't say it's you.

1740
01:01:29,175 --> 01:01:32,211
(7th rank: So Min, 8th rank: Jong Kook)

1741
01:01:33,012 --> 01:01:34,013
Okay.

1742
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:36,716
Let's get started again.

1743
01:01:36,716 --> 01:01:38,451
- What are you standing in front of? - Number four.

1744
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:39,552
I want to do four.

1745
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:41,287
I'm going to do it.

1746
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:44,190
I'm going to do it.

1747
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:47,327
- Who agrees to rock-paper-scissors? - Me.

1748
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:50,330
Why? Isn't it mine if I stood in front of it first?

1749
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:52,699
- It's him. - I agree.

1750
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:54,100
He's acting strangely.

1751
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,168
- You're acting strangely. - Why?

1752
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:57,036
- It's so obvious. - Can you let him go first?

1753
01:01:57,036 --> 01:01:58,338
It's so obvious.

1754
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:00,540
- Can you let him go first? - You guys are ridiculous.

1755
01:02:00,873 --> 01:02:03,042
I'm so natural.

1756
01:02:03,142 --> 01:02:05,712
Why are you doubting me? This is driving me nuts.

1757
01:02:05,712 --> 01:02:07,347
What did you say?

1758
01:02:07,347 --> 01:02:09,882
- "This is driving me nuts." - You're driving us nuts.

1759
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:11,918
Okay.

1760
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,086
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1761
01:02:13,086 --> 01:02:14,821
(They do rock-paper-scissors to be fair.)

1762
01:02:15,288 --> 01:02:16,990
Okay, I take four.

1763
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,325
- Rock-paper-scissors - This is driving me nuts.

1764
01:02:19,325 --> 01:02:20,426
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1765
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:21,728
- Okay. - What? Am I in last place?

1766
01:02:21,828 --> 01:02:23,763
- Rock-paper-scissors - Goodness.

1767
01:02:24,263 --> 01:02:25,365
- Hey. - Seok Jin.

1768
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:28,735
(He has to go to the remaining spot.)

1769
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:31,237
- Are you staying at three? - Yes.

1770
01:02:31,237 --> 01:02:32,905
I'll do two.

1771
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:34,540
- This is driving me nuts. - One at a time.

1772
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,076
Why don't you just get eliminated?

1773
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:38,978
Then we'll be less suspicious of you.

1774
01:02:38,978 --> 01:02:41,280
You guys put me at six.

1775
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:45,151
- Do you want to switch with me? - Sure, let's switch.

1776
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:47,420
(He doesn't hesitate.)

1777
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,222
- Really? - See?

1778
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:51,257
- Switch. It doesn't matter. - What if both...

1779
01:02:51,257 --> 01:02:52,792
- Are they both safe? - No,

1780
01:02:52,792 --> 01:02:54,727
he said he wanted two.

1781
01:02:54,727 --> 01:02:56,796
He wanted 4 or 2.

1782
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:57,897
(If Seok Jin survives, he's likely to be the absolute member.)

1783
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:59,932
- Let's switch. Okay. - Really?

1784
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:01,934
I don't care.

1785
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:04,604
Why does Kwang Soo not want to switch?

1786
01:03:04,604 --> 01:03:05,605
(He's another target.)

1787
01:03:05,605 --> 01:03:06,706
(He would've asked by now.)

1788
01:03:06,706 --> 01:03:08,608
- I already made up my mind. - What?

1789
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:09,976
(They're getting suspicious.)

1790
01:03:09,976 --> 01:03:11,144
Let's switch.

1791
01:03:11,144 --> 01:03:12,278
(He feels Kwang Soo out.)

1792
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,347
- I want to stay here. - Here?

1793
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:16,682
- Why? - You like to switch though.

1794
01:03:16,783 --> 01:03:18,351
- I know. - I like where I am.

1795
01:03:18,351 --> 01:03:19,485
I have a good feeling.

1796
01:03:19,919 --> 01:03:21,721
I think it's Kwang Soo.

1797
01:03:21,721 --> 01:03:22,922
(Who is the absolute member?)

1798
01:03:22,922 --> 01:03:25,792
It must be Kwang Soo and Seok Jin.

1799
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:27,727
- It could be two. - Okay, so...

1800
01:03:28,628 --> 01:03:31,130
- Kwang Soo, go first. - Is it one at a time?

1801
01:03:31,464 --> 01:03:33,399
- I'm scared. - One,

1802
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:35,301
two,

1803
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:37,103
three.

1804
01:03:39,272 --> 01:03:40,306
(He falls on a mattress as predicted.)

1805
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:43,109
- It's Kwang Soo. - I think it's him.

1806
01:03:43,409 --> 01:03:44,477
Okay!

1807
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:47,313
Do I go?

1808
01:03:47,914 --> 01:03:49,449
I'm going to vote for him.

1809
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:53,186
1, 2, 3.

1810
01:03:53,186 --> 01:03:54,220
Let's go!

1811
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:55,221
(He shouts in confidence.)

1812
01:03:56,456 --> 01:04:01,294
(Is he the absolute member who knows where the mattresses are?)

1813
01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:02,428
Let's go!

1814
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:04,697
(He breaks through the wall.)

1815
01:04:09,368 --> 01:04:12,538
(He gets five stars for breaking, jumping, and landing.)

1816
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:13,539
Are you all right?

1817
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:16,676
(He's not the absolute member.)

1818
01:04:16,909 --> 01:04:20,113
Okay, it's Kwang Soo.

1819
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:22,515
It wasn't Seok Jin!

1820
01:04:22,515 --> 01:04:23,516
(I'm absolutely not the absolute member.)

1821
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:25,251
- It's not me! - Sorry for doubting you.

1822
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:27,353
- I told you it wasn't me! - I'm sorry.

1823
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:28,454
It's not me!

1824
01:04:28,454 --> 01:04:30,156
It's not him.

1825
01:04:30,156 --> 01:04:32,692
- That was so funny. - He collapsed.

1826
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:33,693
(Sorry for doubting you.)

1827
01:04:33,693 --> 01:04:34,794
That was so funny.

1828
01:04:34,794 --> 01:04:37,830
- Number three. - Hey, that was so funny.

1829
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,933
- 1, 2, 3. - I laughed so much.

1830
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:42,135
- Three. - Oh, gosh.

1831
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:44,504
(Se Chan chose number 3.)

1832
01:04:44,504 --> 01:04:45,538
Okay!

1833
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:47,440
(He's safe.)

1834
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,309
- Okay! - He passed.

1835
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:51,310
Number four.

1836
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:53,513
(Haha, the former absolute member, chose 4.)

1837
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:55,148
- What a relief. - Are you good?

1838
01:04:55,815 --> 01:04:57,083
I was so scared.

1839
01:04:57,283 --> 01:04:59,285
(Then...)

1840
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:00,786
(1 of these 2 has the mud.)

1841
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:03,122
- It's one of them. - Goodness.

1842
01:05:03,122 --> 01:05:07,426
5 and 6 will go together.

1843
01:05:07,426 --> 01:05:10,530
1, 2...

1844
01:05:10,530 --> 01:05:11,898
(Will he get unlucky yet again and fall into the mud?)

1845
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:14,133
(Will she continue to be lucky?)

1846
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:15,668
Three. Run.

1847
01:05:15,801 --> 01:05:19,805
(Who will fall into the mud?)

1848
01:05:21,274 --> 01:05:23,409
(If it's not Jae Seok,)

1849
01:05:23,409 --> 01:05:26,012
(it's Ji Hyo.)

1850
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:28,781
(The lucky Ji Hyo falls into the mud.)

1851
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:30,049
What was that?

1852
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:31,717
- What was that? - What did you do?

1853
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:34,820
Ji Hyo is in 6th place, and Seok Jin is in 5th.

1854
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:35,888
(Ji Hyo fell into the mud, and Seok Jin fell into the water.)

1855
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:40,126
3rd and 4th ranks will be decided in this round.

1856
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:41,694
- This is going to be ridiculous. - I know.

1857
01:05:41,827 --> 01:05:44,530
What if we do rock-paper-scissors and decide for each other?

1858
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:45,998
- Should we do that? - That's a good idea, right?

1859
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:47,733
- Yes. - The person...

1860
01:05:47,733 --> 01:05:49,335
- who wins gets to decide. - For everybody.

1861
01:05:49,335 --> 01:05:51,270
- The winner decides for all. - What if I have...

1862
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,438
- Put your hands up if you agree. - something...

1863
01:05:52,438 --> 01:05:53,806
Put your hands up if you agree.

1864
01:05:53,806 --> 01:05:54,807
- Who agrees? - I agree.

1865
01:05:54,807 --> 01:05:56,175
- I agree totally. - Are you sure?

1866
01:05:56,175 --> 01:05:58,077
- It's not me. - Do you agree? Okay.

1867
01:05:58,077 --> 01:06:00,146
It's Kwang Soo. I can see it from here.

1868
01:06:00,146 --> 01:06:01,881
I swear it's not me.

1869
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:04,784
(They all doubt him.)

1870
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:07,587
Do you know how you look right now? This is your face.

1871
01:06:07,687 --> 01:06:10,323
- "It's not me." - It's not.

1872
01:06:10,323 --> 01:06:13,025
- It's not me. This way... - I agree.

1873
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:15,561
Your face!

1874
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:16,696
(Staring)

1875
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:20,466
I swear it's not me! Don't look at me like that.

1876
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:22,735
Don't look at me like that. I swear it's not me.

1877
01:06:22,735 --> 01:06:24,070
It's not me.

1878
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:26,505
I'll go where you tell me to. It's not me.

1879
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:27,506
(Is Kwang Soo the absolute member?)

1880
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:29,976
Can I say one thing?

1881
01:06:30,076 --> 01:06:32,878
Did he know when he asked to switch?

1882
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:34,614
(Did Jae Seok know when he asked to switch last time?)

1883
01:06:35,248 --> 01:06:36,916
He wanted to switch from two.

1884
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:37,917
(That's right. Moments ago...)

1885
01:06:37,984 --> 01:06:39,185
- Do you want to switch with me? - Sure, let's switch.

1886
01:06:39,185 --> 01:06:41,887
(Jae Seok was standing in front of 2.)

1887
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:45,324
(He switched with Seok Jin and survived.)

1888
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:49,462
(Did he know everything and planned it all?)

1889
01:06:49,562 --> 01:06:51,297
He wanted to switch from two.

1890
01:06:51,297 --> 01:06:53,132
We were all doubting him.

1891
01:06:53,132 --> 01:06:54,900
You're really natural right now.

1892
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,102
Why were you like that earlier?

1893
01:06:56,535 --> 01:06:58,704
He turns natural once he falls into the water.

1894
01:06:58,704 --> 01:07:00,139
He's himself again.

1895
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,974
- Okay, let's go. - That's not true.

1896
01:07:01,974 --> 01:07:04,076
Let's do rock-paper-scissors and go where we want.

1897
01:07:04,076 --> 01:07:05,544
- Okay. - I have no idea.

1898
01:07:05,544 --> 01:07:07,446
- It's Jae Seok or Kwang Soo. - I think it's Jae Seok.

1899
01:07:07,446 --> 01:07:08,848
(Is the absolute member Jae Seok or Kwang Soo?)

1900
01:07:08,848 --> 01:07:09,882
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1901
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:11,317
Rock-paper-scissors

1902
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:12,918
(The winner gets to decide the position.)

1903
01:07:12,918 --> 01:07:14,487
- You and me? - Rock-paper-scissors

1904
01:07:14,553 --> 01:07:15,855
Rock-paper-scissors

1905
01:07:15,855 --> 01:07:18,157
(Jae Seok wins. He's a strong candidate for the absolute member.)

1906
01:07:18,624 --> 01:07:20,059
- You go second. - Yes.

1907
01:07:20,059 --> 01:07:21,627
I go first. I get to stand where I want to.

1908
01:07:21,627 --> 01:07:22,862
That's right. Wait.

1909
01:07:22,862 --> 01:07:24,130
We should decide too.

1910
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,231
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1911
01:07:25,464 --> 01:07:27,199
(Kwang Soo is another candidate, and he goes last.)

1912
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:28,334
- Okay. - I take the last one left.

1913
01:07:29,335 --> 01:07:31,070
(He lost.)

1914
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:32,138
You get to go last.

1915
01:07:32,138 --> 01:07:33,172
- It's not me. - Fine.

1916
01:07:33,172 --> 01:07:34,940
I swear it's not me. Please.

1917
01:07:35,107 --> 01:07:36,442
It's not me!

1918
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:40,179
Viewers, it's not me. Please trust me. Please.

1919
01:07:40,246 --> 01:07:41,580
- Okay. - It's not me!

1920
01:07:41,714 --> 01:07:42,715
I...

1921
01:07:43,249 --> 01:07:44,583
- choose 2. - 2?

1922
01:07:44,583 --> 01:07:45,718
I choose one.

1923
01:07:46,485 --> 01:07:47,653
I choose three.

1924
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:49,021
- Four for me. - Okay.

1925
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:51,757
That person must have a mission.

1926
01:07:51,757 --> 01:07:52,925
Right?

1927
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,894
That's right. Maybe they have to be the remaining four.

1928
01:07:54,894 --> 01:07:56,462
They might just have to be the remaining four.

1929
01:07:56,462 --> 01:07:58,064
- That's true. - It's the remaining three.

1930
01:07:58,230 --> 01:07:59,565
The person who falls into the water...

1931
01:07:59,832 --> 01:08:01,000
is a bad man.

1932
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,535
(This is his gut feeling.)

1933
01:08:02,535 --> 01:08:03,903
Bad man?

1934
01:08:03,969 --> 01:08:04,970
- Hey. - Bad man?

1935
01:08:04,970 --> 01:08:06,405
- What do you mean? - What was that?

1936
01:08:06,472 --> 01:08:08,574
He wore his cap like a fool too.

1937
01:08:08,774 --> 01:08:10,242
- He's the absolute member. - Go.

1938
01:08:10,242 --> 01:08:12,078
Let's start with 1. Number 1.

1939
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:13,746
- One, - Is it this one?

1940
01:08:13,879 --> 01:08:14,947
two,

1941
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:16,515
three.

1942
01:08:16,515 --> 01:08:17,717
(Se Chan is doing well today. Will he move on?)

1943
01:08:18,617 --> 01:08:19,719
- Okay! - Is it a mattress?

1944
01:08:20,353 --> 01:08:22,588
(He lands on a mattress 3 times in a row.)

1945
01:08:22,588 --> 01:08:23,889
Why is he so lucky?

1946
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:25,458
It's not him.

1947
01:08:25,458 --> 01:08:26,625
It can't be the person who wins.

1948
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:28,561
I think they have to be the remaining three.

1949
01:08:28,561 --> 01:08:30,262
- This is crazy. - Two.

1950
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,298
He's going to lose.

1951
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:36,969
(He lands on a mattress 3 times in a row as well.)

1952
01:08:36,969 --> 01:08:38,137
It's either 3 or 4.

1953
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:39,739
Yes!

1954
01:08:40,506 --> 01:08:41,607
(They're getting very suspicious.)

1955
01:08:41,607 --> 01:08:43,042
It's him then.

1956
01:08:43,175 --> 01:08:45,478
It was Haha earlier, so it's him.

1957
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:47,680
- 3 and 4. - Hold on.

1958
01:08:48,447 --> 01:08:49,815
It's water and mud, right?

1959
01:08:49,815 --> 01:08:51,517
- Yes. - I'm going to fly.

1960
01:08:51,517 --> 01:08:53,886
Mud is 4th rank, and water is 3rd.

1961
01:08:54,086 --> 01:08:57,656
1, 2, 3.

1962
01:08:57,656 --> 01:09:00,393
(Who will be the 3rd rank and raise suspicions?)

1963
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:08,167
(Kwang Soo: 3rd rank, Haha: 4th rank)

1964
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:09,935
It's him. He's the culprit.

1965
01:09:10,336 --> 01:09:11,670
- Is it him? - It's him.

1966
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:13,105
- It's him. - No!

1967
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,540
- It's him. - It's not me.

1968
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:16,842
- It's not me! - He's the culprit, everybody.

1969
01:09:16,842 --> 01:09:18,043
I would have gone for six.

1970
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:19,378
Haha is in 4th rank,

1971
01:09:19,545 --> 01:09:21,180
and Kwang Soo is in 3rd.

1972
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:23,249
- 3rd rank? - Right on point.

1973
01:09:23,582 --> 01:09:25,785
I think it's Kwang Soo.

1974
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:27,019
Okay. This is good.

1975
01:09:27,019 --> 01:09:30,089
This is the final round.

1976
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:31,390
Let's do rock-paper-scissors,

1977
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:33,192
and the winner gets to decide. What do you think?

1978
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:34,226
Okay.

1979
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,494
- Rock - The winner gets to decide.

1980
01:09:35,494 --> 01:09:36,562
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1981
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:38,431
(Se Chan wins.)

1982
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,465
I...

1983
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:41,600
choose one.

1984
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,335
Good. I'll go for two.

1985
01:09:43,569 --> 01:09:44,637
Let's get started.

1986
01:09:44,637 --> 01:09:46,238
- It was my decision. - Watch.

1987
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:47,239
Ready...

1988
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,041
One,

1989
01:09:49,442 --> 01:09:50,543
two,

1990
01:09:51,177 --> 01:09:52,211
three.

1991
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,883
(Jae Seok gets the mattress, and Se Chan gets the mud.)

1992
01:09:57,883 --> 01:09:59,018
I survived.

1993
01:09:59,185 --> 01:10:00,252
This is cold.

1994
01:10:00,252 --> 01:10:01,454
(Jae Seok gets the mattress, and Se Chan gets the mud.)

1995
01:10:01,454 --> 01:10:03,656
(Se Chan is in 2nd rank for the 2nd mission.)

1996
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,959
How did this happen to me?

1997
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:09,428
- It's Jae Seok. - How!

1998
01:10:09,628 --> 01:10:10,796
You're acting strangely.

1999
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:12,765
- What? - How did you win?

2000
01:10:12,765 --> 01:10:13,799
I know.

2001
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:16,035
This doesn't make any sense. It's strange you won.

2002
01:10:16,035 --> 01:10:17,136
I can't...

2003
01:10:17,303 --> 01:10:18,804
- This is strange. - I can't believe it either.

2004
01:10:18,804 --> 01:10:20,339
It doesn't make any sense Jae Seok won this game.

2005
01:10:20,339 --> 01:10:22,141
- It doesn't. - I'm shocked too.

2006
01:10:22,508 --> 01:10:27,780
(Current ranking)

2007
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:29,548
It's either one of these.

2008
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:31,350
It's Jae Seok or Kwang Soo.

2009
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,518
But...

2010
01:10:32,985 --> 01:10:34,620
If Jae Seok won rock-paper-scissors...

2011
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,255
and told me where to go,

2012
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:38,557
I'd have the answer, but I won.

2013
01:10:38,557 --> 01:10:40,659
He switched too many times though.

2014
01:10:40,659 --> 01:10:42,761
I'm confident.

2015
01:10:42,828 --> 01:10:45,164
- Who got third place last time? - Haha.

2016
01:10:45,164 --> 01:10:46,165
It was Haha.

2017
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:47,333
Who's in third place this time?

2018
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:49,768
- That's it, everybody. - What do you mean?

2019
01:10:49,935 --> 01:10:51,003
This time...

2020
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:53,372
It's either Kwang Soo or Jae Seok.

2021
01:10:53,372 --> 01:10:56,075
- I'm so confused. - Think it through. It's not me.

2022
01:10:56,075 --> 01:10:57,243
I'm not the absolute member.

2023
01:10:57,510 --> 01:10:59,545
- Oh, gosh. - Two people...

2024
01:11:00,012 --> 01:11:02,147
will vote at a time.

2025
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:03,482
(They start voting.)

2026
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:07,653
(It's time to decide.)

2027
01:11:08,354 --> 01:11:11,257
(Whom did they vote as the absolute member?)

2028
01:11:11,357 --> 01:11:13,392
What's the result? I'm curious.

2029
01:11:13,459 --> 01:11:15,160
Is it close?

2030
01:11:15,594 --> 01:11:17,196
- It's very close. - Really?

2031
01:11:17,329 --> 01:11:18,464
It's either one of them.

2032
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:19,598
Here are the results.

2033
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:22,535
Kwang Soo has four votes.

2034
01:11:22,835 --> 01:11:23,936
- It's Kwang Soo. - Is it a tie?

2035
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:25,404
Jae Seok also has four.

2036
01:11:25,404 --> 01:11:27,072
- It's a tie. - Is it a tie?

2037
01:11:27,072 --> 01:11:29,141
(They both have 4 votes, and it's a tie.)

2038
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:30,976
- We'll vote again. - Vote again?

2039
01:11:30,976 --> 01:11:32,912
(They decide to vote again for the first time.)

2040
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:36,782
Then let's have them two go in the booth.

2041
01:11:37,049 --> 01:11:38,817
They're going to vote for each other.

2042
01:11:38,817 --> 01:11:40,553
- Can we discuss? - Obviously.

2043
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:41,921
We're going to vote for each other.

2044
01:11:41,921 --> 01:11:44,223
- You should go in the booth. - Okay, let's go.

2045
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,491
Come here.

2046
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:47,259
- Hey. - Who is it?

2047
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:48,494
- I think it's Kwang Soo. - What?

2048
01:11:48,494 --> 01:11:50,195
- I think it's him. - Do you?

2049
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:52,231
- I think it's Jae Seok. - Me too.

2050
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:53,399
(He thinks it's Jae Seok.)

2051
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:57,603
(Jae Seok started in 8th rank.)

2052
01:11:58,837 --> 01:12:03,309
(He switched with Seok Jin and avoided the obstacle,)

2053
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:07,580
(but people started to doubt him.)

2054
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:10,416
(Kwang Soo behaved strangely at times,)

2055
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:13,419
(but they were more suspicious because Jae Seok never wins.)

2056
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:17,389
(He's known for being unlucky, but he won.)

2057
01:12:17,389 --> 01:12:18,924
- I say it's Jae Seok. - Me too.

2058
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:19,992
Me too.

2059
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:21,393
Come out.

2060
01:12:21,393 --> 01:12:22,561
- You two can come out. - Are we good?

2061
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:24,997
(The re-voting has concluded.)

2062
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:27,032
All right. Here are the results.

2063
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,069
- Kwang Soo... - Please be nice.

2064
01:12:30,703 --> 01:12:33,205
Kwang Soo has 2 votes, and Jae Seok has 6.

2065
01:12:33,205 --> 01:12:34,206
(Jae Seok: 6 votes, Kwang Soo: 2 votes)

2066
01:12:34,206 --> 01:12:37,943
(The members voted that Jae Seok was the absolute member.)

2067
01:12:37,943 --> 01:12:41,213
According to the voting results, you were able to...

2068
01:12:41,213 --> 01:12:44,416
(According to the voting results, you were able to...)

2069
01:12:44,416 --> 01:12:45,517
Arrest the absolute member.

2070
01:12:45,517 --> 01:12:47,119
(They were successful.)

2071
01:12:48,187 --> 01:12:51,123
(Jae Seok was the second absolute member.)

2072
01:12:51,123 --> 01:12:53,993
You know which numbers advance through the game.

2073
01:12:54,893 --> 01:12:56,261
You're the absolute member.

2074
01:12:56,695 --> 01:12:58,464
This is...

2075
01:12:58,464 --> 01:12:59,665
(He was the absolute member who knew which numbers won.)

2076
01:13:00,232 --> 01:13:02,167
Jae Seok is in last place.

2077
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:03,402
(They arrest him right before he won.)

2078
01:13:03,402 --> 01:13:05,004
Please bring the penalty list.

2079
01:13:05,037 --> 01:13:06,238
(There's a penalty that the winner gets to pick.)

2080
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:07,506
Please choose one.

2081
01:13:07,506 --> 01:13:08,807
This is your worst day.

2082
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:11,377
- Slapping forehead. - Forehead?

2083
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:13,545
- Kwang Soo can do it. - Me?

2084
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:15,948
There's a chemistry.

2085
01:13:16,081 --> 01:13:17,316
- There's a forehead chemistry. - Okay!

2086
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:20,019
- "Forehead chemistry"? - Show us.

2087
01:13:20,285 --> 01:13:22,588
I welcome slaps from Kwang Soo.

2088
01:13:23,188 --> 01:13:24,556
I'll save this penalty...

2089
01:13:24,623 --> 01:13:26,592
and slap his forehead another time.

2090
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:29,695
(He'll save it for another time.)

2091
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:31,263
- Whenever. - This is great.

2092
01:13:31,263 --> 01:13:32,731
(I've seen this before.)

2093
01:13:32,898 --> 01:13:34,133
I'll slap him later.

2094
01:13:34,133 --> 01:13:37,202
(Jae Seok did that for Kwang Soo.)

2095
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:41,040
(Kwang Soo finally got the penalty in Busan.)

2096
01:13:41,407 --> 01:13:43,709
Not now. I'm working right now, so I can't hit him.

2097
01:13:43,709 --> 01:13:45,310
- Is this allowed? - There's no time.

2098
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:46,345
This is great.

2099
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:48,580
We can't waste our precious time on this.

2100
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,749
- I'll do it another time. - Oh, gosh.

2101
01:13:51,684 --> 01:13:52,785
I approve.

2102
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:54,153
(Will this yield an enormous butterfly effect?)

2103
01:13:54,153 --> 01:13:58,857
(Number of badges)

2104
01:13:59,324 --> 01:14:02,428
This is the last mission to decide on the final ranks.

2105
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:04,263
- It's the Dice of Fate. - What is that?

2106
01:14:04,263 --> 01:14:05,731
(Final Mission: Dice of Fate)

2107
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:06,899
Dice?

2108
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,067
Dice?

2109
01:14:08,367 --> 01:14:10,402
- Can we turn the tables? - Of course.

2110
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:11,637
Okay, there has to be.

2111
01:14:12,304 --> 01:14:17,409
Each member has a standard die with numbers 1 through 6,

2112
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,079
and you'll be given more pips...

2113
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:22,548
according to the number of badges you have.

2114
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:24,249
(They get more pips according to the number of badges.)

2115
01:14:24,249 --> 01:14:25,851
You can place the additional pips...

2116
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:28,787
on any side of the die you want.

2117
01:14:28,987 --> 01:14:31,490
- You get to roll the die twice, - It's the numbers game.

2118
01:14:31,657 --> 01:14:35,694
and your final ranks will be decided according to the largest sums.

2119
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:38,197
(Their finals ranks will be decided according to the largest sums.)

2120
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:39,364
You can turn the tables around.

2121
01:14:39,465 --> 01:14:41,867
We have to decide if we want to spread the pips out or not.

2122
01:14:41,867 --> 01:14:44,837
I should put it all on one side.

2123
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:45,871
(You've got one shot in life.)

2124
01:14:45,871 --> 01:14:46,905
It's one side.

2125
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:49,274
- I'm going for one side. - For sure.

2126
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:53,112
- Do we take our dice? - This is too little.

2127
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,149
Gosh, this is awesome.

2128
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:58,517
(Haha is currently in 1st place.)

2129
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:02,554
This is driving me nuts. If I lose here, I'm going to cry.

2130
01:15:02,788 --> 01:15:04,990
- Haha, I have a side with 10. - 10?

2131
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:06,058
(He has 2 sides with 10, and he spreads out the rest.)

2132
01:15:06,058 --> 01:15:07,259
What's that for?

2133
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,894
First place.

2134
01:15:08,894 --> 01:15:10,629
(1st and 2nd places seek for balance and stability.)

2135
01:15:10,629 --> 01:15:12,664
I'm thinking about putting everything on one side.

2136
01:15:14,633 --> 01:15:16,135
That works.

2137
01:15:16,368 --> 01:15:18,504
I'm going to put it on one side.

2138
01:15:18,871 --> 01:15:22,107
It's not all or nothing. It's "all".

2139
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:24,209
It's "all".

2140
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:26,245
If you have trypophobia,

2141
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:29,915
you can look away for a moment.

2142
01:15:31,183 --> 01:15:32,351
What's that?

2143
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:34,453
He's incredible.

2144
01:15:34,553 --> 01:15:36,088
He has many pips.

2145
01:15:36,088 --> 01:15:37,656
(They're done distributing the pips.)

2146
01:15:37,756 --> 01:15:40,993
If it's 27, I'm going to go nuts.

2147
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:43,462
- I'm going. - Okay.

2148
01:15:44,263 --> 01:15:46,598
- Okay, there's no practice. - All right.

2149
01:15:46,598 --> 01:15:49,067
I only have one side.

2150
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:50,769
(He has one empty side, and the rest are equally distributed.)

2151
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:52,805
(He rolls the balanced die.)

2152
01:15:52,805 --> 01:15:53,906
Dud.

2153
01:15:54,673 --> 01:15:56,942
- I hope it's a dud. - Dud.

2154
01:15:56,942 --> 01:15:59,812
(The final ranks will depend on the sum of two rolls.)

2155
01:15:59,812 --> 01:16:01,613
I have to be safe.

2156
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:06,318
(Will he keep his 1st place with this die?)

2157
01:16:06,685 --> 01:16:08,120
- Dud. - Okay, eight!

2158
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,154
It's safe.

2159
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:12,791
(He succeeds. He gets 8 on the 1st try.)

2160
01:16:13,425 --> 01:16:15,661
(He has many pips, so it works out for him.)

2161
01:16:15,661 --> 01:16:16,695
It's safe.

2162
01:16:17,963 --> 01:16:19,164
- I'm jealous. - Me too.

2163
01:16:19,198 --> 01:16:22,301
Se Chan is next.

2164
01:16:22,301 --> 01:16:23,368
I'm the lucky guy.

2165
01:16:23,368 --> 01:16:25,103
(Se Chan's 1st attempt)

2166
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,271
What's the highest number you have?

2167
01:16:26,305 --> 01:16:27,973
There are 2 sides with 10.

2168
01:16:28,907 --> 01:16:31,510
(He has 2 high numbers and 2 empty sides.)

2169
01:16:31,510 --> 01:16:33,078
Dud. It's a dud!

2170
01:16:34,213 --> 01:16:37,783
(4 sides are distributed safely.)

2171
01:16:37,783 --> 01:16:40,452
(How is his 1st attempt?)

2172
01:16:40,452 --> 01:16:41,587
- It's a dud. - Dud!

2173
01:16:41,587 --> 01:16:44,489
(It's a dud!)

2174
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:49,761
(His dream of winning dissipates.)

2175
01:16:49,928 --> 01:16:53,465
(He only had two empty sides.)

2176
01:16:53,465 --> 01:16:55,367
That burns.

2177
01:16:56,468 --> 01:16:58,170
(Yes, we have a chance too.)

2178
01:16:58,170 --> 01:16:59,705
What is this?

2179
01:17:01,206 --> 01:17:02,741
I had high numbers on either side.

2180
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:04,676
(Haha: 8, Se Chan: 0)

2181
01:17:05,077 --> 01:17:06,912
I put 1 pip each on all 5 sides.

2182
01:17:07,246 --> 01:17:09,047
The last side has 27.

2183
01:17:09,047 --> 01:17:10,983
(The lucky side of Kwang Soo's die has 27 pips.)

2184
01:17:10,983 --> 01:17:12,718
(Practicing)

2185
01:17:13,018 --> 01:17:15,153
Okay. I am bound to win if I get this side.

2186
01:17:15,153 --> 01:17:17,556
(He is bound to win if he gets the side with 27 pips.)

2187
01:17:18,123 --> 01:17:21,593
(He throws the die as he has practiced.)

2188
01:17:22,895 --> 01:17:25,297
(He throws powerfully for the one last hope in his life.)

2189
01:17:25,297 --> 01:17:27,566
(If the die stops here,)

2190
01:17:27,566 --> 01:17:30,369
(Kwang Soo can turn the tables.)

2191
01:17:30,369 --> 01:17:32,371
I just need to get this side once.

2192
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:37,609
(Let's see if Kwang Soo's tactic is successful.)

2193
01:17:38,644 --> 01:17:41,780
(He gets the side with 1 pip.)

2194
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:44,516
(There is no miracle.)

2195
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:48,820
(Haha comes close to getting outrun.)

2196
01:17:49,454 --> 01:17:53,592
(It gives hope to the other tiger moths.)

2197
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,163
My goodness. I thought he would succeed.

2198
01:17:58,563 --> 01:17:59,965
He almost ended the game.

2199
01:18:00,465 --> 01:18:02,935
(The current score in Round 1)

2200
01:18:04,169 --> 01:18:06,104
Do you have 27 pips on that side?

2201
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:08,774
- Do you have 27 pips on that side? - Yes, I do.

2202
01:18:08,774 --> 01:18:10,409
(She copies Kwang Soo, the senior tiger moth.)

2203
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:11,743
I have 27 pips on a single side as well.

2204
01:18:11,743 --> 01:18:13,345
- Okay. - Please.

2205
01:18:13,345 --> 01:18:15,113
- Please let her get a dud. - A dud.

2206
01:18:15,113 --> 01:18:16,615
- A dud. - A dud.

2207
01:18:16,615 --> 01:18:18,150
(So Min hurls the die.)

2208
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:21,219
(For a tiger moth, it's all or nothing.)

2209
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:22,888
- My goodness. - I got startled for a second.

2210
01:18:22,888 --> 01:18:23,956
(She gets the side with 0 pips.)

2211
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,959
(The wings of the tiger moth gets burnt.)

2212
01:18:26,959 --> 01:18:28,093
- I knew it. - Okay.

2213
01:18:28,093 --> 01:18:30,762
- They went all in. - It keeps you on your toes.

2214
01:18:30,762 --> 01:18:32,164
The tiger moths don't disappoint.

2215
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:33,899
- This is driving me crazy. - Move back.

2216
01:18:33,899 --> 01:18:35,701
- It's okay. - The tiger moths don't disappoint.

2217
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:36,902
- I still have a chance. - I will get it the next time.

2218
01:18:37,135 --> 01:18:38,637
Jump right in.

2219
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:40,339
- Is it my turn? Okay. - Jump right in.

2220
01:18:40,339 --> 01:18:41,807
- All right. - Here I go.

2221
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:44,843
Give me a decent number of pips.

2222
01:18:44,843 --> 01:18:46,044
Don't go sideways!

2223
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:47,946
(Unless he gets 0 pips, he is sure to join the high rank.)

2224
01:18:49,047 --> 01:18:51,817
(Jong Kook gets the side with 0 pips.)

2225
01:18:53,652 --> 01:18:56,021
(His despair gives the others hope.)

2226
01:18:56,021 --> 01:18:58,190
- Goodness... - How is this possible?

2227
01:18:59,024 --> 01:19:01,093
Jong Kook is unlucky today.

2228
01:19:01,593 --> 01:19:02,594
Please.

2229
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:03,762
Come on.

2230
01:19:03,762 --> 01:19:04,796
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

2231
01:19:04,796 --> 01:19:07,032
(Rise, my lucky energy.)

2232
01:19:07,632 --> 01:19:08,633
Two pips.

2233
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:10,736
Ji Hyo and Jong Kook aren't doing so well today.

2234
01:19:10,736 --> 01:19:11,737
(The ace members are suffering.)

2235
01:19:12,204 --> 01:19:14,006
I never thought a day like this would come to me.

2236
01:19:14,406 --> 01:19:17,576
- Haha is in the first place. - This is incredible.

2237
01:19:18,377 --> 01:19:20,679
(We didn't know we could be this unlucky.)

2238
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:23,548
A side with 20 pips and a side with 7 pips.

2239
01:19:23,548 --> 01:19:28,286
(All the other sides except for 2 have 0 pips.)

2240
01:19:28,286 --> 01:19:30,355
(He has no choice but to make a drastic bet.)

2241
01:19:30,355 --> 01:19:31,590
A dud.

2242
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:34,760
(Let's see if Seok Jin will succeed.)

2243
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:38,130
(No way! He gets the side with 20 pips!)

2244
01:19:38,964 --> 01:19:43,335
(Seok Jin, the tiger moth, succeeds after going all in.)

2245
01:19:43,335 --> 01:19:46,938
(He experiences a miracle in his 50s.)

2246
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:49,307
- No way! - I got the side with 20 pips.

2247
01:19:49,641 --> 01:19:52,077
(I can't believe my eyes.)

2248
01:19:52,677 --> 01:19:55,414
(Why didn't it work for me?)

2249
01:19:55,547 --> 01:19:57,315
You only get one shot in life!

2250
01:19:57,749 --> 01:19:59,017
Bring it on.

2251
01:19:59,017 --> 01:20:02,187
- That was insane. - Why did you do that, Seok Jin?

2252
01:20:02,187 --> 01:20:03,588
We get two throws.

2253
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:05,590
- I got the side with 20 pips. - If...

2254
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,926
If I fail here, I won't get to win.

2255
01:20:07,926 --> 01:20:09,995
Please. Please let me do this.

2256
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,567
(I have to do something...)

2257
01:20:15,567 --> 01:20:17,869
(before I admit to my defeat.)

2258
01:20:17,869 --> 01:20:21,706
(Jae Seok distributed the stickers on two sides.)

2259
01:20:22,707 --> 01:20:23,742
(His die has 2 sides with 13 pips.)

2260
01:20:23,742 --> 01:20:25,377
- It's a dud. - A dud.

2261
01:20:25,977 --> 01:20:29,181
(The die rolls towards a side with 13 pips.)

2262
01:20:29,181 --> 01:20:32,117
(A side with 13 pips can give him a chance to turn the tables.)

2263
01:20:32,451 --> 01:20:33,452
It's a dud.

2264
01:20:33,452 --> 01:20:37,089
(It's a dud.)

2265
01:20:37,089 --> 01:20:38,123
It's a dud.

2266
01:20:38,723 --> 01:20:42,661
(Goodbye, Jae Seok's chance of turning the tables.)

2267
01:20:43,028 --> 01:20:44,229
It's a dud.

2268
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:47,199
(He is an unlucky member through and through.)

2269
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:48,333
Jae Seok.

2270
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:51,570
There is a high chance I will win. It looks like I will win.

2271
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:53,205
(The 1st round ends with the members' joy and despair.)

2272
01:20:53,205 --> 01:20:57,075
(Seok Jin: 20, Haha: 8, Ji Hyo: 2, Kwang Soo: 1,)

2273
01:20:57,075 --> 01:20:59,277
(the rest: 0.)

2274
01:20:59,377 --> 01:21:00,479
Here I go.

2275
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:02,881
(Haha wants to secure his position in the 2nd place.)

2276
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:04,082
All right.

2277
01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:07,085
Did you spread the stickers?

2278
01:21:07,085 --> 01:21:08,753
(Please let it be a dud.)

2279
01:21:10,188 --> 01:21:13,758
(Let's see what Haha gets on his 2nd attempt.)

2280
01:21:14,693 --> 01:21:16,027
Okay! I did it!

2281
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:18,463
(He gets the side with 9 pips.)

2282
01:21:18,463 --> 01:21:20,799
(He is currently in the 2nd place with a score of 17.)

2283
01:21:20,799 --> 01:21:23,034
Okay! I did it! Nine pips.

2284
01:21:23,435 --> 01:21:25,003
- 9 pips. - 9 pips.

2285
01:21:25,036 --> 01:21:26,204
I did it.

2286
01:21:26,271 --> 01:21:27,539
Here I go.

2287
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:29,574
(Se Chan's 2nd attempt)

2288
01:21:29,574 --> 01:21:31,409
Please let it be a high number.

2289
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:32,611
Please let it be a high number. There you go!

2290
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:34,146
(He gets the side with 9 pips this time.)

2291
01:21:34,146 --> 01:21:36,114
- Nine pips. - Okay.

2292
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:38,350
It's not half bad. Okay!

2293
01:21:39,484 --> 01:21:41,219
- Are you ready? - Okay.

2294
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:42,721
(Kwang Soo's 2nd attempt)

2295
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:44,890
- I will get the side with 27 pips. - He might get it.

2296
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:47,025
I bet he will get it.

2297
01:21:47,025 --> 01:21:48,627
I bet he will get the side with one pip.

2298
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:49,728
(Come on out, the side with 27 pips.)

2299
01:21:50,395 --> 01:21:54,332
(Is the die rolling towards that direction?)

2300
01:21:54,332 --> 01:21:56,334
(Hold on.)

2301
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:57,636
I bet he will get the side with one pip.

2302
01:21:57,636 --> 01:22:00,972
(Let's see if he will place 1st with a lucky shot.)

2303
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:05,677
(He gets the side with 1 pip again.)

2304
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:09,648
(What are the odds?)

2305
01:22:10,282 --> 01:22:13,185
(You are in the lower rank.)

2306
01:22:14,119 --> 01:22:15,120
It's over.

2307
01:22:15,387 --> 01:22:16,588
I thought he would get it.

2308
01:22:16,588 --> 01:22:17,656
Seriously.

2309
01:22:17,656 --> 01:22:20,025
(Please let me avoid the lowest rank.)

2310
01:22:20,358 --> 01:22:21,459
Please.

2311
01:22:21,459 --> 01:22:22,561
(So Min's 2nd attempt)

2312
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:23,862
Please.

2313
01:22:23,862 --> 01:22:26,298
(She wants to turn the tables this time.)

2314
01:22:27,632 --> 01:22:28,700
Three pips.

2315
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:30,802
(The side has 3 pips.)

2316
01:22:30,802 --> 01:22:35,140
(The tiger moth gets the side with 3 pips.)

2317
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:37,409
- You still beat Kwang Soo. - No!

2318
01:22:37,409 --> 01:22:38,410
You still beat Kwang Soo.

2319
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,444
(How much more must I fall?)

2320
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:41,279
The ground is caved.

2321
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:42,314
Is it my turn?

2322
01:22:43,715 --> 01:22:45,250
(Ji Hyo is in the 5th place alongside Kwang Soo.)

2323
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,284
Please.

2324
01:22:47,652 --> 01:22:49,588
(Let's see what Ji Hyo's final score will be.)

2325
01:22:49,588 --> 01:22:51,189
A dud. My goodness.

2326
01:22:51,189 --> 01:22:52,424
- 9 pips. - 9 pips.

2327
01:22:52,424 --> 01:22:53,458
(Ji Hyo is in the 4th place with a score of 11.)

2328
01:22:53,458 --> 01:22:55,193
- 9 pips. - 9 pips.

2329
01:22:55,193 --> 01:22:56,995
Then I should move the stickers to one side.

2330
01:22:57,295 --> 01:22:58,797
(The members on the bottom become busy.)

2331
01:22:58,797 --> 01:23:00,765
I should have 11 pips on one side.

2332
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:02,300
Jae Seok is busy.

2333
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:04,502
He is so busy.

2334
01:23:04,669 --> 01:23:09,507
It's hard to play this game without many pips.

2335
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:11,743
- Five. - This is bad.

2336
01:23:11,977 --> 01:23:14,512
Is it my turn? This is bad. I am going all in.

2337
01:23:14,512 --> 01:23:16,581
- What will you do if you fail? - I am going all in.

2338
01:23:16,881 --> 01:23:19,384
(Jong Kook puts 19 pips on a single side.)

2339
01:23:19,384 --> 01:23:20,685
A lot of sides are empty.

2340
01:23:20,852 --> 01:23:22,621
A lot of sides are empty.

2341
01:23:22,921 --> 01:23:25,523
- You aren't usually like this. - I am going all in.

2342
01:23:25,523 --> 01:23:26,791
He is going all in.

2343
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:29,127
I have no other choice.

2344
01:23:29,594 --> 01:23:30,829
I have to.

2345
01:23:30,829 --> 01:23:33,031
(I need to get the side with 19 pips.)

2346
01:23:33,031 --> 01:23:34,099
I am going all in.

2347
01:23:34,099 --> 01:23:36,701
(He throws the die to make up for the past failure.)

2348
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:42,540
(Can Jong Kook turn the tables?)

2349
01:23:43,742 --> 01:23:45,043
- My goodness. - Yes!

2350
01:23:45,043 --> 01:23:47,912
(It's a dud again.)

2351
01:23:48,013 --> 01:23:49,314
- Dud! - He is in the last place.

2352
01:23:49,314 --> 01:23:50,815
(Jong Kook gets 2 duds in a row and ranks last.)

2353
01:23:50,815 --> 01:23:52,417
- Jong Kook. - I just need one pip.

2354
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,619
Why did you do that? That's so unlike you.

2355
01:23:54,619 --> 01:23:56,154
Jae Seok is so busy.

2356
01:23:56,154 --> 01:23:58,089
I just need one pip.

2357
01:23:58,089 --> 01:23:59,424
It's your last attempt.

2358
01:23:59,424 --> 01:24:00,692
Jong Kook.

2359
01:24:01,126 --> 01:24:02,327
All right.

2360
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:05,664
(Jong Kook is in the last place alongside Jae Seok.)

2361
01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:07,098
- Here I go. - Okay.

2362
01:24:07,098 --> 01:24:08,466
(Jae Seok is Jong Kook's rival.)

2363
01:24:08,466 --> 01:24:09,668
I bet he will get a dud.

2364
01:24:10,735 --> 01:24:13,738
(He distributes the pips so that only one side is empty.)

2365
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,374
- How many pips are there? - Seven.

2366
01:24:16,441 --> 01:24:17,542
I am in the fifth place.

2367
01:24:17,542 --> 01:24:19,778
It's impressive that I moved up that much.

2368
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:22,747
Okay. One more time. Please do me this favor.

2369
01:24:22,747 --> 01:24:24,516
- Seok Jin. - If he gets the same side...

2370
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:26,217
Let's get the same side one more time!

2371
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:28,586
(Let's get the side with 20 pips 1 more time!)

2372
01:24:29,321 --> 01:24:34,426
(On his 1st attempt, he went all in and took the 1st place.)

2373
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:40,999
(Let's see if he recreates the glorious moment.)

2374
01:24:41,866 --> 01:24:45,670
(No way! He gets the side with 20 pips again.)

2375
01:24:46,604 --> 01:24:50,175
(Seok Jin is on a roll today.)

2376
01:24:50,675 --> 01:24:51,876
(Screaming)

2377
01:24:51,876 --> 01:24:52,944
What is going on?

2378
01:24:52,944 --> 01:24:54,446
(Is this real?)

2379
01:24:55,513 --> 01:24:59,184
(They witness a miracle.)

2380
01:24:59,184 --> 01:25:00,719
- It's over. - It's over.

2381
01:25:01,152 --> 01:25:02,387
(Screaming)

2382
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:04,622
- It's over. - The world is mine!

2383
01:25:04,856 --> 01:25:06,524
The world is mine!

2384
01:25:06,591 --> 01:25:07,592
(He feels like his times of struggles are over.)

2385
01:25:07,592 --> 01:25:08,626
It's over.

2386
01:25:08,626 --> 01:25:10,695
What did we do all day?

2387
01:25:10,695 --> 01:25:12,397
(He is dejected.)

2388
01:25:12,397 --> 01:25:15,100
How did I get this side twice? This is insane.

2389
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,434
(The legendary penalty begins soon.)

2390
01:25:16,501 --> 01:25:18,036
In a surprising turn of events,

2391
01:25:18,036 --> 01:25:20,739
Jong Kook is in the last place with a score of zero.

2392
01:25:20,972 --> 01:25:24,509
The penalty is called the Collective Love and Penalty.

2393
01:25:24,509 --> 01:25:25,643
(Collective Love and Penalty)

2394
01:25:25,643 --> 01:25:28,646
Starting from the member in the first place,

2395
01:25:29,414 --> 01:25:32,717
you will use the tool you are given to throw water at the next member.

2396
01:25:32,717 --> 01:25:34,619
(Use the tool you are given to throw water at the next member.)

2397
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:36,087
Then Seok Jin won't get the penalty.

2398
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:37,422
No, I won't.

2399
01:25:38,056 --> 01:25:39,357
He will be dry.

2400
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:41,993
Are you in the seventh place? For goodness' sake.

2401
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:44,596
(Why is it Kwang Soo of all people?)

2402
01:25:44,596 --> 01:25:45,997
Why is Kwang Soo in the seventh place?

2403
01:25:45,997 --> 01:25:48,533
In the interview, I said I'd work hard to beat you.

2404
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,236
- Let's go. - That's cute.

2405
01:25:51,236 --> 01:25:52,771
Haha, clink the cups.

2406
01:25:52,771 --> 01:25:53,938
Cheers.

2407
01:25:53,938 --> 01:25:55,206
(Seok Jin holds a small cup.)

2408
01:25:55,206 --> 01:25:57,842
(The 2nd place simply gets his face moisturized.)

2409
01:25:58,376 --> 01:25:59,611
That's cute.

2410
01:25:59,611 --> 01:26:01,346
(Haha throws Ji Hyo a glass of water.)

2411
01:26:02,247 --> 01:26:05,383
(She gets moisturized more than Haha.)

2412
01:26:05,383 --> 01:26:06,684
(I can feel the water on me.)

2413
01:26:06,684 --> 01:26:07,719
It's annoying, right?

2414
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:09,687
Ji Hyo, what you suffered is nothing.

2415
01:26:09,687 --> 01:26:11,656
- Okay. - It's annoying, right?

2416
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:13,458
- Okay? - Okay.

2417
01:26:13,458 --> 01:26:14,626
Why are you directing your anger at me?

2418
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:16,428
- Okay. It's the collective love. - The collective love.

2419
01:26:16,428 --> 01:26:18,897
Check out how much I love you, Se Chan.

2420
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:20,665
- Move out or you'll get hit. - It'll hurt.

2421
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,502
(Se Chan, I love you this much.)

2422
01:26:24,502 --> 01:26:26,871
Jae Seok, why are you wet?

2423
01:26:27,305 --> 01:26:30,708
(Why is Jae Seok already wet?)

2424
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:33,011
(When Ji Hyo threw the water,)

2425
01:26:33,011 --> 01:26:36,848
(Jae Seok got hit while watching.)

2426
01:26:37,882 --> 01:26:39,684
- Okay. - Okay. I got hit.

2427
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:41,019
- Okay. - I got hit.

2428
01:26:41,019 --> 01:26:43,021
- Okay. Did you get hit? - I got hit.

2429
01:26:43,021 --> 01:26:44,022
(That's your business.)

2430
01:26:47,091 --> 01:26:50,695
(Is that a drenched grasshopper?)

2431
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:51,963
- My goodness. - Okay.

2432
01:26:52,897 --> 01:26:55,733
(Here is the side effect of the collective love.)

2433
01:26:55,834 --> 01:26:58,303
(You can become very ugly.)

2434
01:26:58,937 --> 01:27:00,071
Okay.

2435
01:27:00,839 --> 01:27:01,840
So Min, come here.

2436
01:27:02,674 --> 01:27:05,910
(Jae Seok throws So Min a washbowl of water.)

2437
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:07,579
- Okay. - Okay.

2438
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:10,181
- Okay. - Hey, I was worried about you.

2439
01:27:10,348 --> 01:27:11,683
Hey, I was worried about you.

2440
01:27:12,217 --> 01:27:15,420
- 1, 2... - Gosh, that's big.

2441
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,688
(So Min has a big bucket for him.)

2442
01:27:16,688 --> 01:27:17,856
- Three. - Look at her. She's not strong.

2443
01:27:17,856 --> 01:27:18,957
It was heavy even for us.

2444
01:27:18,957 --> 01:27:20,325
(Splashing)

2445
01:27:21,759 --> 01:27:23,194
(He can't handle her affection towards him.)

2446
01:27:23,194 --> 01:27:25,330
Good job. Well done.

2447
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:27,832
- Great. So Min, good job. - Okay.

2448
01:27:27,832 --> 01:27:29,868
- He fell back right away. - That was awesome.

2449
01:27:30,134 --> 01:27:32,036
Look at Jong Kook. I thought he was a staff member.

2450
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:34,806
(Feeling dejected)

2451
01:27:35,874 --> 01:27:36,908
Okay.

2452
01:27:37,242 --> 01:27:39,043
- Okay. - Pass on the love to him.

2453
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:40,245
(This is today's highlight.)

2454
01:27:40,245 --> 01:27:42,580
- This is fun. - Please crouch down.

2455
01:27:42,647 --> 01:27:44,816
- Okay. - Give me a second.

2456
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:46,651
(Wringing)

2457
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:47,752
I have more water in here.

2458
01:27:48,119 --> 01:27:51,055
(He squeezes out every ounce of affection from So Min.)

2459
01:27:51,055 --> 01:27:52,423
There's a lot.

2460
01:27:54,025 --> 01:27:55,360
This one will be strong. There's a lot of water.

2461
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:56,394
One,

2462
01:27:57,262 --> 01:27:58,263
two...

2463
01:27:58,263 --> 01:27:59,597
(His love fills the huge bucket for the finale.)

2464
01:27:59,597 --> 01:28:01,766
- You should splash from afar. - Why are you nervous?

2465
01:28:01,766 --> 01:28:03,601
- This feels great. - Great, great.

2466
01:28:03,668 --> 01:28:04,702
I'll do it right away.

2467
01:28:07,539 --> 01:28:09,274
(Splashing)

2468
01:28:09,841 --> 01:28:14,913
(I'll return all the love you have given me so far.)

2469
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:17,749
(His love is as vast as the ocean.)

2470
01:28:17,749 --> 01:28:19,150
It was like a bomb.

2471
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:22,253
Wait, Jong Kook.

2472
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:23,388
(Startled)

2473
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:26,224
(Okay. Your turn is over.)

2474
01:28:26,224 --> 01:28:27,258
What should I do?

2475
01:28:27,425 --> 01:28:29,460
I didn't do anything wrong.

2476
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,763
- Jong Kook is mad. - Listen to me. That's not it.

2477
01:28:31,763 --> 01:28:33,298
- Jong Kook is mad. - Okay.

2478
01:28:33,298 --> 01:28:35,266
I had a feeling that you guys were getting too comfortable.

2479
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,834
- That's not it. - Great.

2480
01:28:36,834 --> 01:28:39,404
No, no. I'm in seventh. I had no choice.

2481
01:28:39,437 --> 01:28:41,372
- He's really mad. - Are you all right?

2482
01:28:41,372 --> 01:28:44,375
- Gosh, that's cold. - I had a bit of water left.

2483
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,543
(He stays faithful to the end.)

2484
01:28:45,543 --> 01:28:47,545
Okay. This is great.

2485
01:28:48,146 --> 01:28:49,681
The winner of today's race is...

2486
01:28:50,114 --> 01:28:52,483
How many years has it been?

2487
01:28:52,483 --> 01:28:54,752
- Jong Kook was placed last. - Seriously.

2488
01:28:54,752 --> 01:28:57,221
Seok Jin won the race. I wonder if this has ever happened before.

2489
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:58,456
Hold on. He won the race,

2490
01:28:58,456 --> 01:28:59,857
but he only splashed the shot glass. Is that it?

2491
01:29:00,925 --> 01:29:02,827
- All right. - Seok Jin, here's your trophy.

2492
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:04,362
Here's the trophy.

2493
01:29:04,362 --> 01:29:07,432
(His victory seems insignificant compared to this historical moment.)

2494
01:29:07,565 --> 01:29:09,133
Seok Jin, here's the hat.

2495
01:29:10,868 --> 01:29:13,338
Congratulations on your winning, Seok Jin!

2496
01:29:13,338 --> 01:29:14,339
(We never know when he'll win again.)

2497
01:29:14,339 --> 01:29:15,940
This is a great accomplishment.

2498
01:29:17,408 --> 01:29:19,477
(Darkness falls on the night of Halloween.)

2499
01:29:19,477 --> 01:29:22,747
(The festival of the ghosts has begun.)

2500
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:25,550
(One by one, mysterious ghosts...)

2501
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:28,453
(are assembling.)

2502
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,556
(And important guests have come at the news of the festival.)

2503
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:34,225
(Ahn Hyo Seop, Son Na Eun, and Seo Young Hee)

2504
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:35,560
We're wearing this for this game.

2505
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:39,030
(The festival with ghosts who have a lot of grudges begins.)

2506
01:29:39,931 --> 01:29:42,200
(They can't ever get enough of laughter.)

2507
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:44,235
(They start fulfilling their wishes on this variety show.)

2508
01:29:44,535 --> 01:29:45,970
(However...)

2509
01:29:46,337 --> 01:29:48,306
(Someone has opened up a box that wasn't supposed to be open.)

2510
01:29:48,573 --> 01:29:51,209
(And this awakens the ghosts' instincts.)

2511
01:29:51,209 --> 01:29:53,645
(And the real identities of the ghosts are revealed.)

2512
01:29:53,645 --> 01:29:55,380
(There is an uninvited guest among them.)

2513
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,649
(What on earth happened here?)

2514
01:29:57,649 --> 01:29:59,951
(The Nightmare of Halloween)
