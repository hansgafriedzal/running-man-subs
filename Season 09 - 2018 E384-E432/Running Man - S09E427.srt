1
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,220
(Last week)

2
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:11,550
(Kang Han Na and Seol In A return.)

3
00:00:11,558 --> 00:00:14,195
(Joy and Irene come back stronger.)

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,060
(The couple battle starts as soon as they arrive.)

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:19,730
(It's a fierce battle where they steal each other's partners.)

6
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:24,530
(There hasn't been a matchmaking game like this before.)

7
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:25,900
(Some were happy...)

8
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,940
(and some were wounded.)

9
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:30,010
(Everyone found a pair.)

10
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,110
(Current partner status)

11
00:00:33,113 --> 00:00:35,710
With familiar partners,

12
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:38,110
you'll play Finding Thief Race.

13
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,280
"Finding Thief"?

14
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:42,085
(Familiar Partner, Finding Thief Race)

15
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:45,525
There's a thief hiding.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,830
Among you, there are two male...

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,130
and two female thieves.

18
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:54,930
Two each?

19
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,700
Gosh, Han Na. Look at her act.

20
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,430
(She's a thief.)

21
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,100
What do you mean?

22
00:01:01,108 --> 00:01:02,470
She got startled.

23
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,040
- All of a sudden. - That's strange.

24
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:06,140
That's very strange.

25
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:07,740
It's Finding Thief Race.

26
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:09,650
- A thief? - Wait a minute.

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,485
(What was that awkward tone?)

28
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:15,120
- She acted surprised. - No!

29
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:16,820
She's suspicious.

30
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,320
She's very suspicious.

31
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,290
Something smells fishy.

32
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:23,325
There's no reason why Irene would choose me.

33
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,960
- We need to make deductions. - Gosh, Han Na.

34
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:27,230
We haven't chosen the thieves yet.

35
00:01:27,234 --> 00:01:29,865
(The director tells them the truth.)

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,870
(The thieves haven't been picked?)

37
00:01:31,872 --> 00:01:33,570
Oh, not yet?

38
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:35,170
- See! - We haven't picked them.

39
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,140
I'm so sorry, Irene.

40
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:38,610
(They get suspicious so easily.)

41
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,545
You should've told us sooner!

42
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:42,080
(Amidst all this, he is calm.)

43
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:44,510
- Really? We're choosing now? - What?

44
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:45,680
I'm so sorry.

45
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,180
Seok Jin!

46
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:49,850
Enough with the acting from the start!

47
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,750
Seok Jin acts like he's the one.

48
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:52,890
- What are you doing? - Seriously.

49
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,360
- Don't act guilty. - Honestly,

50
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:56,020
I love it when you doubt me.

51
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,860
- Stop it. - I love it.

52
00:01:58,866 --> 00:02:00,430
Continue doing that for me.

53
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:01,530
(This 50-year-old yearns for attention.)

54
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,265
He wants us to do that.

55
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,370
(Whether you're a thief or not,)

56
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,370
(there's only one way to win.)

57
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:10,710
If your final partner is a thief, you get penalized.

58
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,180
If your final partner is a citizen, you receive a reward.

59
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,310
Okay.

60
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,640
From now,

61
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,210
let's randomly pick the thieves.

62
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,720
- Randomly? - I see.

63
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:23,155
I should observe their expressions.

64
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,455
We need to look at their faces.

65
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,720
Among the 6 cards, there are 4 citizen cards...

66
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:28,790
and two thief cards.

67
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,860
- I can't be a thief. - 4 citizens and 2 thieves.

68
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:33,060
- I'll go first. - It's so stressful to be a thief.

69
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,935
I'll take the last one.

70
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,470
- Me too. - Goodness.

71
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,570
I don't like...

72
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,570
- being a thief. - Right?

73
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,370
- You're anxious all day. - It's stressful.

74
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:44,940
It's such a hassle to be a thief.

75
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,875
(But deep down, he has his fingers crossed.)

76
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:52,350
(Sadly, Seok Jin is a citizen.)

77
00:02:52,352 --> 00:02:55,015
(I see... I'm a thief...)

78
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,790
(The men finish choosing.)

79
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,455
I checked mine.

80
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:01,260
Irene, good luck.

81
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,995
(It's the ladies' turn.)

82
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:05,465
Observe your partners.

83
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,465
(I'm watching you.)

84
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,170
(Everyone finishes choosing.)

85
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,430
I saw mine.

86
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,630
Citizens, we can do it.

87
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,840
Okay, thief.

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I got you, thief.

89
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:16,200
(They already start doubting.)

90
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,070
He's definitely a thief.

91
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,680
- He's a thief. - What do you mean?

92
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,110
- What do you mean? - Are you a citizen then?

93
00:03:21,114 --> 00:03:22,510
He is a citizen.

94
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:23,810
How do you know already?

95
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,550
We're both citizens.

96
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:28,250
If you turn out to be a thief, I'll be greatly disappointed.

97
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,250
Trust me.

98
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,450
- It's so easy to seduce Kwang Soo. - Right.

99
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:34,220
- I won't hurt you anymore. - She's doing it again.

100
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:35,720
Change into your uniforms,

101
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,460
- and let's move. - Okay.

102
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:40,730
(After they finish choosing,)

103
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:44,005
(all the thieves and citizens change their uniforms.)

104
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,470
Jae Seok, you're all-blue.

105
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,970
(He's wearing a blue top and blue pants.)

106
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:50,970
Isn't that a bit too much?

107
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:52,710
It's the chroma key effect.

108
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,015
- I didn't plan this. - Chroma key.

109
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,350
If it's funny, that'll suffice.

110
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,650
That's great.

111
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,350
(He's a funny chroma key.)

112
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:05,250
(He does look funny.)

113
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,390
(While they're eyeing one another in doubt,)

114
00:04:07,394 --> 00:04:09,260
(an important rule is thrown at them.)

115
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:10,890
To the winning couple,

116
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:12,830
we'll disclose their partners' identities.

117
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,600
(This is for every mission.)

118
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,130
- Goodness. - Really?

119
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,770
That's huge.

120
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,230
- Wow. - Okay.

121
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:21,370
For the losing couple,

122
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,570
we will disclose to all of you...

123
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:25,510
whether one of them is a thief or not.

124
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:28,480
(If one of them is a thief, everybody will know.)

125
00:04:28,482 --> 00:04:32,680
(That means, the thieves will try their best not to come last place.)

126
00:04:32,686 --> 00:04:34,220
Seok Jin, stop acting.

127
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,380
What are you doing?

128
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,120
- Why are you stretching? - What's wrong with you?

129
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,985
- I need to run. - Stretching won't help.

130
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,430
All right, we will play a game beforehand with a quite useful...

131
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,990
- chance card at stake. - A game?

132
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,960
This chance card...

133
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,900
will make the winning team gain victory by default.

134
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:52,770
- By default? - For the losing team,

135
00:04:52,773 --> 00:04:53,840
it will act as a revival card.

136
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,975
(The card can be used for victory or revival.)

137
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,110
The game...

138
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,410
is called Say Three Syllables.

139
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,080
Ji Hyo's good at this.

140
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll say the first syllable,

141
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,380
and a couple will finish it.

142
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:05,550
If it's a celebrity name and I say,

143
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:06,720
- Kim. - Jong.

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
- Kook. - Right.

145
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,750
I see.

146
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:10,725
- Do you get it? - Yes.

147
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,220
Should we run first?

148
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,255
(Joy asks a question.)

149
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,760
Where to?

150
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:17,530
We have to run first, right?

151
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,190
Where to?

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,460
- No. - Ji Hyo...

153
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,860
I told you. Joy is weird.

154
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,200
- She doesn't know. - She's lost.

155
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:25,670
Joy, wake up.

156
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:26,900
(Apart from her identity, she's just weird.)

157
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:27,970
If I say, "Hong", what should you say?

158
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:30,140
If you win three consecutive times, you pass.

159
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:31,710
Three consecutive times?

160
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,140
First category is...

161
00:05:33,146 --> 00:05:34,915
celebrities.

162
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:36,280
Nam.

163
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,280
Ji.

164
00:05:37,284 --> 00:05:38,985
Hyun.

165
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,050
Noh.

166
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,680
- Sa. - Yeon.

167
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:42,780
Do.

168
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:44,250
- Ji. - Won.

169
00:05:44,257 --> 00:05:47,190
(They get all three correct.)

170
00:05:47,194 --> 00:05:48,860
- Okay! - Yes!

171
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,525
Okay!

172
00:05:50,697 --> 00:05:52,160
They said, "Do Ji Won".

173
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:53,965
How did they think of that?

174
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:55,760
That was good.

175
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,030
(It was a hard one.)

176
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,200
That was good.

177
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,470
(They reacted very quickly.)

178
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,770
- That was... - Next category is...

179
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,040
- food. - Food?

180
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,805
- Hold on. - It's not bad.

181
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:08,080
Here we go. Gam.

182
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,340
- Ja. - Tang.

183
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:10,880
- Kim. - So.

184
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:11,880
Bap.

185
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:13,680
(Haha gives up.)

186
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,080
- What's kimsobap? - What?

187
00:06:15,088 --> 00:06:17,920
(Is there such a food name?)

188
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,150
- What is that? - What was that?

189
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,520
You could have said kimchi jjim.

190
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,790
You fail.

191
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,130
- What's kimso? - I don't know.

192
00:06:25,132 --> 00:06:26,430
- Kimsobap? - This is hard.

193
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:28,330
Try to explain yourself.

194
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,660
She's a thief.

195
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:31,800
I was thinking of another dish.

196
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:34,000
This category is animals.

197
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:35,875
- Wa. - Pi.

198
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,070
What?

199
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,110
(It's Jong Kook and In A's turn.)

200
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,980
(Jong Kook gets it wrong.)

201
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,910
- Wait. - Wapiti.

202
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:43,850
- I mean... - Hold on.

203
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,310
- You pointed at me. - You fail.

204
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,020
- You failed. - He pointed at me.

205
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,020
- This is his fault. - He pointed at me.

206
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:52,320
Amidst all this, So Min...

207
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,520
- told me an interesting story. - What?

208
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:55,660
- What? - What did she say?

209
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,530
"What if four-letter Chinese idioms come out?"

210
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,325
We're only doing three syllables.

211
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,500
(During the game)

212
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:04,370
(What if four-letter Chinese idioms come out?)

213
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,370
(We are only doing three syllables.)

214
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:10,040
(She can't differentiate between 3 and 4.)

215
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,240
Who goes first?

216
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:12,640
You do.

217
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:15,345
For this team, it doesn't matter who goes first.

218
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:18,085
The category is objects.

219
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,180
We'll start. Flower.

220
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:21,680
- Bou. - Quet.

221
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,220
- Instant. - Noodles.

222
00:07:23,223 --> 00:07:24,290
Extract.

223
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,920
(Instant noodles extract?)

224
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:31,460
(Do you get the extract by squeezing the noodles?)

225
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,630
- Instant noodles? - What was that?

226
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,430
What is instant noodles extract?

227
00:07:36,436 --> 00:07:39,130
- What is that? - Sorry.

228
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:40,200
Did we fail?

229
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:41,340
Of course.

230
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,800
The category is food.

231
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,475
Delicious.

232
00:07:44,711 --> 00:07:46,440
- Side. - Dishes.

233
00:07:46,446 --> 00:07:50,150
(Delicious side dishes?)

234
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,380
Delicious side dishes?

235
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:52,550
(Was that what they meant?)

236
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:53,980
- Delicious side dishes? - You should've said...

237
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:55,250
yam extract.

238
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,150
Why do you like extracts so much?

239
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,020
- Stop it. - Yam extracts are great.

240
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,920
- Extracts are food. - You like them too much.

241
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,660
- Yam extract. - Last round.

242
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:03,990
- Who's turn is it? - Who wants to go?

243
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,890
- She does. - Me.

244
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,700
- What's the category? - I imagined it for a second.

245
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:11,270
I imagined if you two...

246
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,130
were a couple.

247
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,240
Really? How did it look?

248
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,505
You cannot be lazy at all.

249
00:08:16,643 --> 00:08:17,710
Right.

250
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:18,910
I'm serious.

251
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,710
- He's right. - You shouldn't sleep.

252
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:23,180
- I have to be diligent. - Yes.

253
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:25,910
- You have to take care of her. - I see.

254
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,580
- Take care of her? - Yes.

255
00:08:27,587 --> 00:08:29,620
- I'm like a slave. - Yes.

256
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:31,090
A slave?

257
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,290
Let's start.

258
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,420
The category is animals.

259
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:34,560
Please give easy ones.

260
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:36,220
- Okay. - All right.

261
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,890
We'll start. Tal.

262
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:39,160
- Pi. - Dae.

263
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:40,300
- Ba. - By.

264
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,560
- Calf. - E.

265
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,435
- Le. - Phant.

266
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:44,970
- Those were too easy. - No.

267
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:46,570
Those were way too easy.

268
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,970
(Hold on.)

269
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,540
- Weren't they too easy? - Come on.

270
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,040
That's too much.

271
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,980
Even my kid could do it.

272
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,480
- What was that? - I'll be more diligent!

273
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,010
- You gave us the hard ones. - I've succeeded!

274
00:08:58,018 --> 00:09:00,980
(Kwang Soo's team and Se Chan's team rise to the finals.)

275
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:02,180
- This is the finals. - Okay.

276
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:03,890
This category...

277
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,050
is not limited. It just needs to make sense.

278
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:07,290
- I'll start. - Kwang Soo.

279
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:08,920
- Hold on. - There's an insect.

280
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:09,920
Why?

281
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:12,030
(Gibbering)

282
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:13,600
(She swings her arms about.)

283
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,530
- What was that? - I wasn't pranking her.

284
00:09:15,535 --> 00:09:16,770
- I'm serious. - What have you done?

285
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm serious.

286
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,400
- What have you done? - There was an insect.

287
00:09:19,406 --> 00:09:20,900
I'm not lying.

288
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,870
- Let me see. - Are you all right, Joy?

289
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,970
I'm sorry. There was an earwig.

290
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,680
- Joy. - Yes?

291
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,040
You were very natural.

292
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:33,050
(Put your arms in the air and swing them left and right)

293
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:35,150
Joy's reaction is worth remembering.

294
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:38,650
(If it comes out as an emoticon, it's worth buying.)

295
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:39,890
- We'll really start. - Okay.

296
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:41,120
Joy will go first.

297
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,790
- We'll start. - You'll go first.

298
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,760
Joy's turn. Kang.

299
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:46,190
- San. - Ae.

300
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:47,230
Jun.

301
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,730
- Ji. - Hyun.

302
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,730
S.

303
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:50,770
- Ky. - Lark.

304
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,500
(Correct)

305
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:55,100
(They get 3 consecutive questions right.)

306
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,840
- If we win again, it'll be a tie. - Right.

307
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:57,910
- Let's go. - Okay.

308
00:09:57,911 --> 00:09:59,870
Who'll go first? You have to decide.

309
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,280
Irene.

310
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,410
- You go first. - Right.

311
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:04,410
- Should I? - No, I'll go first.

312
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:05,580
Sure, go ahead.

313
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:06,610
(The answer already exists.)

314
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:09,220
I bet she picked him because she doesn't feel pressured.

315
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,750
I can see it in her facial expression.

316
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,290
She never once looked at you.

317
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,520
That's not true.

318
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:16,660
It's unusual for team members to stand like this.

319
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:19,260
- She's cold-hearted. - They usually face each other.

320
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll just take a peek at her.

321
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,030
(I can approach her first.)

322
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,500
(This slave...)

323
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:29,475
(has his eyes locked on her.)

324
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,640
(That was romantic.)

325
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:33,045
That was a romantic response.

326
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,115
That's great.

327
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:36,410
We'll start.

328
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,915
- All right. - Irene first.

329
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:41,650
Irene will go first. You.

330
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:42,950
- Little. - Punk.

331
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:47,460
(You little punk?)

332
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,920
(Incorrect)

333
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,060
(The lovely vibe and the chance card have both disappeared.)

334
00:10:51,064 --> 00:10:52,730
- "You little punk" works. - Goodness.

335
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:53,900
From how I see it,

336
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,430
Irene didn't care about what Se Chan would say.

337
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,270
It's all up to him to make it work.

338
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,370
Goodness.

339
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:00,870
You're quite high-maintenance.

340
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:02,040
The chance card will be given...

341
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,070
- to Kwang Soo's team. - Yes!

342
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,140
(The chance card will be useful.)

343
00:11:05,145 --> 00:11:06,975
We did it.

344
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,240
(We're off to a good start.)

345
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:09,680
We're off to a good start.

346
00:11:09,682 --> 00:11:12,050
This first mission offers a chance to check the identity of thieves...

347
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:15,020
as well as a chance to change partners.

348
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,350
It is the Barefoot Tango.

349
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,850
(Finding Thief Race first mission, The Barefoot Tango)

350
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,990
- What's that? - A barefoot tango?

351
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,560
The woman gets on the man's feet...

352
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,590
in a tango posture and they start walking.

353
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:27,960
The team that moves the rose from the flour pile...

354
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:30,830
to the vase with their mouth first wins.

355
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,630
It's going to be an intense race.

356
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,300
However, if the woman's foot touches the ground,

357
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,340
the other teams will punish them with water guns.

358
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:42,240
(Flour and water guns. How dirty will the game be?)

359
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:47,345
(Barefoot Tango Tournament Chart)

360
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:51,325
(Flour roses in the center of the race)

361
00:11:51,524 --> 00:11:53,190
- You can do it! - You're too close.

362
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:54,960
I'll be ready when you touch the ground.

363
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:57,360
There will be music playing. The race starts with the whistle.

364
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,390
Okay.

365
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,330
Jae Seok likes dancing.

366
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,100
He's getting ready.

367
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:04,405
We shouldn't start late, though.

368
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:06,170
Jae Seok likes dancing.

369
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,000
We'll play the music.

370
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,740
- "Havana"! - It's "Havana".

371
00:12:09,742 --> 00:12:11,445
I love "Havana".

372
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,610
(A melody full of sentiment)

373
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:16,680
Look at Joy!

374
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:19,145
(Along with Joy's groove)

375
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,125
(Glazed eyes)

376
00:12:25,225 --> 00:12:27,560
Kwang Soo's expression is too much.

377
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Hey, So Min.

378
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,265
They look good together!

379
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:35,030
(Wriggling)

380
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,930
(What's with Kwang Soo?)

381
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:37,930
(I can't lose.)

382
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,300
Hey, So Min.

383
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:42,775
(Wriggle wriggle)

384
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:45,310
So Min is a bit weird, right?

385
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:49,845
(There isn't a hint of "Havana" in So Min's dance.)

386
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:53,050
(Flap flap)

387
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:54,450
(When will the race start?)

388
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,150
(Whistle blows.)

389
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:57,855
Let's go!

390
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,420
1, 2. 1, 2.

391
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:00,860
Wait a minute.

392
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,055
(Awkward)

393
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,860
- How are they so fast? - They're so fast.

394
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,300
1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2.

395
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,500
We'll spray you if your feet touch the ground.

396
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:12,400
- Not here! We have to go around. - Okay.

397
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:13,470
Jae Seok.

398
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:15,405
Her feet are on the ground.

399
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,270
Get back up, Joy! Get back up!

400
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:19,410
(Get back up, Joy, get back up!)

401
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,940
Her feet touched the ground!

402
00:13:20,947 --> 00:13:22,610
Let's fire!

403
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:24,080
Why? Why?

404
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,855
1, 2. 1, 2. 1, 2.

405
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:29,750
Stick it in, hurry.

406
00:13:29,756 --> 00:13:31,390
She used her hands!

407
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,660
- Joy, you cheated. - You can only use your mouth.

408
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,760
I didn't know!

409
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,720
Use your mouth. Use your mouth!

410
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:38,530
I didn't know!

411
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:39,760
You have to use your mouth!

412
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:42,065
I tried so hard!

413
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:43,630
So Min, you did well.

414
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:45,230
Go, So Min!

415
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,200
Nice, So Min.

416
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,835
This isn't easy.

417
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:50,470
What do we do now?

418
00:13:50,476 --> 00:13:52,670
- They won by default. - Nice, So Min.

419
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:54,710
Water gun sprayers, come here!

420
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,710
We'll begin the second round.

421
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,310
The music will play.

422
00:13:58,318 --> 00:13:59,850
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo against Jong Kook and In A)

423
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,450
("I'm so sexy" by Yu Jae Seok and JYP)

424
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,350
(Wriggle wriggle)

425
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,490
Let's go.

426
00:14:05,491 --> 00:14:08,795
(The famous dancer revs up her engine!)

427
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,260
- I'm so sexy! - Sexy!

428
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,465
(I'm so sexy.)

429
00:14:15,902 --> 00:14:20,340
(The dancer shows up.)

430
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,205
(The club gets wilder!)

431
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,180
Nice.

432
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,540
(One more time?)

433
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,310
- Don't do it! - I'm so sexy!

434
00:14:32,318 --> 00:14:34,285
Why did you spray me?

435
00:14:35,622 --> 00:14:39,055
(Failing on both ends)

436
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,690
(Corny dad wave)

437
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,995
(Strangely pitiful)

438
00:14:46,165 --> 00:14:47,400
- Let's go. - Come on.

439
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,560
Let's go.

440
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,470
- 1, 2. - Look at him.

441
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,030
- He's carrying her. - Look.

442
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,470
- He's just carrying her. - Jong Kook is carrying her.

443
00:14:54,474 --> 00:14:56,100
- Hurry and go. - Why is she so heavy?

444
00:14:56,109 --> 00:14:58,245
I said, hurry and go!

445
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,410
Hurry and go!

446
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,840
We don't know who will win yet.

447
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:04,215
(Mouthful of rose)

448
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,650
Seok Jin, just move forward!

449
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:10,250
Don't get caught up with useless things!

450
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,220
(We'll get going, then.)

451
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,720
(Jong Kook and In A proceed...)

452
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,160
There's so much flour.

453
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:17,555
I'm not kidding. She's so heavy.

454
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,030
(Seok Jin blames Ji Hyo 100 times for every step he takes.)

455
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:22,995
You're saying it's Ji Hyo's fault?

456
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:25,500
(Meanwhile, this team is about to finish.)

457
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:26,800
Are you mocking us, In A?

458
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,675
(The rose goes in.)

459
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,635
- Hey. - Okay!

460
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:31,970
Nice.

461
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:33,610
(Jong Kook and In A proceed to semifinals.)

462
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,645
- Seok Jin... - She's actually so heavy!

463
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:39,710
Music, start.

464
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:42,280
Play music for a couple dance.

465
00:15:42,288 --> 00:15:44,190
Play music for couples to dance.

466
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,155
Let's go, let's go.

467
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:49,890
("Red Flavor" by Red Velvet)

468
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:53,090
(Irene dances to "Red Flavor".)

469
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:54,630
(Se Chan dances towards her.)

470
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:57,430
It's a couple dance, but Irene dances by herself.

471
00:15:57,437 --> 00:15:59,270
(Irene, look at me.)

472
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:02,935
(Instead of dance moves, it's a hopeless couple dance.)

473
00:16:04,143 --> 00:16:06,040
Lucky her.

474
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:09,545
(We can't lose to them!)

475
00:16:11,718 --> 00:16:14,780
(Flailing)

476
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,450
Han Na's dancing. She's dancing!

477
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:19,155
Look at Kang Han Na.

478
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:23,460
(Happy)

479
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:26,030
(Please don't use your good body like that.)

480
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,060
What kind of dance is that?

481
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:30,295
(The signal starts the race when they were busy dancing.)

482
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,965
(Fumbling)

483
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,200
She's falling.

484
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:39,270
Don't wear socks. It's easier to do it barefoot.

485
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,580
Take your socks off.

486
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,515
1, 2. 1, 2.

487
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,250
- Bite it. - I can't.

488
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:47,550
- Hurry up. - I can't.

489
00:16:47,553 --> 00:16:49,120
- Pick it up. - The other side!

490
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:51,290
My back is going to break.

491
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,490
Come on.

492
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:54,990
Nice job. Let's go now.

493
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:57,160
1, 2. 1, 2.

494
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,090
- Han Na, what are you doing? - What are you doing?

495
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:01,600
- Han Na, what are you doing? - Han Na!

496
00:17:01,601 --> 00:17:03,395
Are you okay?

497
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,000
Nice.

498
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:06,500
(Se Chan and Irene proceed to semifinals.)

499
00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:08,470
- Okay! - Okay!

500
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:09,640
(Barefoot Tango Tournament Chart)

501
00:17:09,642 --> 00:17:12,070
(Kwang Soo and Joy have a chance card.)

502
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,180
(They go against Se Chan and Irene.)

503
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,380
I hope the music is good.

504
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:18,180
You're being picky about the music?

505
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,450
I'm a little excited.

506
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,080
- Do you know why you're excited? - Why?

507
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,920
- It's not because of the music. - Right.

508
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,050
It's all because of Irene.

509
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,150
That's right.

510
00:17:25,158 --> 00:17:27,325
We'll start the music.

511
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:31,625
(It's our song!)

512
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:33,930
It's "Peek-A-Boo".

513
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:34,930
(Wild dance moves)

514
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:37,330
(Red Velvet magic that turns the field into a stage)

515
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:39,000
The two guys should leave!

516
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,105
(Awkward couple dancing on the side)

517
00:17:41,908 --> 00:17:44,670
(Decalcomania couple shimmy)

518
00:17:44,677 --> 00:17:46,470
The two guys should leave!

519
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,380
(Enraged middle-aged fan)

520
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,110
(We can't do that.)

521
00:17:50,116 --> 00:17:53,685
(The more jealousy, the more passion.)

522
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:57,750

523
00:17:57,757 --> 00:18:00,220
1, 2. 1, 2.

524
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,490
Se Chan, you can do it.

525
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:02,690
Nice, nice.

526
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,230
Se Chan, you can do it.

527
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,230
Hurry up!

528
00:18:05,231 --> 00:18:07,060
- Your feet might touch. - Kwang Soo!

529
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,130
Joy's feet touched the ground.

530
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,230
- Her feet touched the ground. - No, that is...

531
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,965
(I bit it first.)

532
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:17,940
(Is he Bigfoot?)

533
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:19,240
(Kwang Soo follows behind.)

534
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:21,140
He's catching up.

535
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:23,145
Smoke is coming out of Kwang Soo.

536
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:24,710
There's smoke coming out.

537
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,010
How can there be smoke?

538
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,820
(Like Thomas the Tank Engine)

539
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,050
We're almost there.

540
00:18:29,055 --> 00:18:31,250
(Kwang Soo's team arrives first through the power of flour engine.)

541
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,420
(They just need to stick the flower in the vase.)

542
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,420
- Come on. - There you go!

543
00:18:35,428 --> 00:18:36,990
You can do it!

544
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:37,990
It went in.

545
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:39,060
(Kwang Soo, who came first to secure a good spot, succeeds.)

546
00:18:39,065 --> 00:18:40,530
It went in! Kwang Soo won.

547
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,630
(Kwang Soo and Joy proceed to finals!)

548
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,400
There must be a thief...

549
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,800
since they're working so hard.

550
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:48,540
(I did work really hard. Not that I'm a thief.)

551
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,200
He needs some water.

552
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,110
- Open your mouth. - Give us some water.

553
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:56,015
(Spraying)

554
00:18:57,783 --> 00:19:01,255
(Easy flour rinsing with water scaling)

555
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,650
(Look at him.)

556
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,690
- It's scaling. - There, you're clean now.

557
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,020
You're clean now.

558
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,120
(He's actually clean.)

559
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,730
- Show your gratitude. - Thank you.

560
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,260
We scaled your teeth.

561
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:13,560
Thank you so much. Thanks.

562
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,335
(Kwang Soo tried hard to win. What is his identity?)

563
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,840
(Semifinals, Jong Kook and In A, Jae Seok and So Min)

564
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,070
(Jong Kook and In A get a head start.)

565
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,505
(Perfect couple freeze)

566
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:27,240
It went in.

567
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,280
(Jong Kook and In A proceed to finals!)

568
00:19:29,282 --> 00:19:31,345
Nice.

569
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,780
(Tango Finals)

570
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:34,980
(Jong Kook and In A, Kwang Soo and Joy)

571
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:36,480
We'll start the finals.

572
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:38,250
We have to look for the thief here.

573
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:41,420
There's definitely a thief there.

574
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:42,520
- Among us? - Yes.

575
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:44,390
I don't understand why.

576
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:45,930
- Let's win. - We have to.

577
00:19:45,932 --> 00:19:47,830
(Who will win the amazing benefit?)

578
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,665
("Fire" by BTS)

579
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:53,100
Kwang Soo, you know this dance, right?

580
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,200
- You know this, right? - You know this!

581
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,470
(He's getting ready.)

582
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,145
(Shoot!)

583
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:02,340
(I'm the hottest man in this town.)

584
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:04,745
(Squeaky)

585
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,650
(What... What are those joints?)

586
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:11,050
(His body crumples like he's on fire.)

587
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:14,390
(Then his joints get lit on fire!)

588
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,590
How do you know this?

589
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:16,760
(She's no match for Kwang Soo.)

590
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:19,895
(The dance battle is more heated than ever for the finals!)

591
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,900
(Maximum expectations)

592
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,430
(Muscular tiger versus attack of the giraffe)

593
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:26,470
Let's go.

594
00:20:26,472 --> 00:20:28,100
Ready, set, go.

595
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:30,770
- They're so fast, look. - Wow, they're really fast.

596
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:32,140
They're so fast.

597
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,710
1, 2. 1, 2.

598
00:20:33,713 --> 00:20:35,180
- They're fast. - Oh, sorry!

599
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,110
No, no, no!

600
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,650
(Long Kwang Soo swoops in again.)

601
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,020
Excuse me! You can't just...

602
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,880
I can't tell who will win.

603
00:20:42,888 --> 00:20:44,920
(Honk honk)

604
00:20:44,924 --> 00:20:46,120
He's starting his engine!

605
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,360
He looks like a white dragon.

606
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:50,960
(He charges forward.)

607
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,190
No! No.

608
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,335
(With the flour engine, he arrives at the finishing line first.)

609
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,035
Kwang Soo...

610
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,300
Kwang Soo hit her with his head!

611
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,105
He cheated!

612
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:03,300
- He hit her! - They won, they won.

613
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,470
(Kwang Soo stuck it in.)

614
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,310
- It's over. Kwang Soo! - Kwang Soo wins!

615
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:08,780
(Kwang Soo and Joy win The Barefoot Tango mission.)

616
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:12,115
- Are you okay? - He cheated.

617
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:13,815
Are you okay?

618
00:21:14,787 --> 00:21:17,620
The couple that placed last in Barefoot Tango...

619
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,320
is Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

620
00:21:19,325 --> 00:21:22,260
- They must reveal themselves. - I'll announce...

621
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:24,490
if any one of them is a thief.

622
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:27,330
One of them must be a thief for Seok Jin's performance.

623
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,600
In Seok Jin and Ji Hyo couple,

624
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,070
(Between the two of them...)

625
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,870
there is a thief.

626
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:33,900
See?

627
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:35,835
(One of them is a thief.)

628
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:36,900
I told you.

629
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:38,545
(Is one of them a thief?)

630
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:40,340
Look.

631
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:44,445
(Seok Jin is a citizen.)

632
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:49,055
(That means...)

633
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:53,525
(Ji Hyo is a thief.)

634
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:57,590
(During the random pick,)

635
00:21:57,596 --> 00:22:01,295
(she picked a thief card.)

636
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,400
(Ji Hyo is 1 of the 2 female thieves.)

637
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:06,970
It must be Seok Jin.

638
00:22:06,972 --> 00:22:08,840
- I think so. - Aren't you a thief?

639
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,100
(She keeps a poker face.)

640
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,940
(He's very flustered.)

641
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:13,070
You're a thief, aren't you?

642
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,510
- Are you a thief? - You're a thief.

643
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:18,680
- Are you a thief? - He's arguing with Ji Hyo.

644
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:20,010
They're fighting.

645
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,720
- I'm not it. - You are a thief.

646
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,780
- I'm human. - I am. You're a thief.

647
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,650
I'm human.

648
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:28,260
(Ji Hyo is good at acting.)

649
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,090
He says that he's human.

650
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:32,630
Are you human, Seok Jin?

651
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,600
- I'm human. - Seriously, Seok Jin?

652
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm human.

653
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,400
Are you human? Stop joking.

654
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,675
What do you mean? Thieves are human too.

655
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,770
I'm human. She keeps saying that I'm a thief.

656
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,340
You know who the thief is, right?

657
00:22:45,344 --> 00:22:47,780
- What do you mean? - Okay, I got it.

658
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,510
The winning couple will go to the room of truth.

659
00:22:52,518 --> 00:22:54,520
- Find out each other's identity. - Gosh.

660
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,120
You'll decide whether to switch partners.

661
00:22:57,123 --> 00:22:58,755
Okay.

662
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,260
One of them must be a thief if they switch.

663
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,090
(If they switch, one of them is likely a thief.)

664
00:23:03,095 --> 00:23:04,130
You aren't a thief, right?

665
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,565
- I'm a citizen. - Right.

666
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:09,600
(They find out their status.)

667
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:10,700
(They enter the room of truth.)

668
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:12,770
- Hello. - Hello.

669
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:16,775
(What is their identity?)

670
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,510
They'll stay as a couple if they're both thieves.

671
00:23:19,512 --> 00:23:21,875
Wouldn't they stay as a couple either way?

672
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:24,015
They'll stay together for now.

673
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:25,950
- To fool the citizens? - Yes.

674
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:27,620
When other couples switch,

675
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
one of them will be picked.

676
00:23:29,622 --> 00:23:31,320
This is difficult.

677
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:33,590
- It's difficult. - It isn't easy.

678
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:36,090
Here's the identity of your partner.

679
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:38,630
We'll start with Joy.

680
00:23:38,631 --> 00:23:41,600
(Joy and Kwang Soo find out about each other's identity.)

681
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,400
If they're both thieves and don't switch partners,

682
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:47,230
- they're smart. - It'll get complicated.

683
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,705
It has more factors to consider than I thought.

684
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:52,410
We have to see how they look.

685
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,770
Then we'll decide.

686
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,810
- Here they come. - They're coming out.

687
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:58,580
(Their time is up in the room of truth.)

688
00:23:58,584 --> 00:24:01,520
(They finally come out of the room.)

689
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
(Cold)

690
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,350
- They argued. - They argued.

691
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,055
They don't look happy.

692
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,420
Stop acting.

693
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:10,995
Both of them are acting.

694
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,890
Are they both thieves?

695
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:14,400
Joy looks upset.

696
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,930
What if they decided to look upset?

697
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:19,200
Their citizen identity can't be obvious.

698
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:22,100
They're afraid others will switch with their partner.

699
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,100
(It's time to announce their decision.)

700
00:24:24,109 --> 00:24:26,210
The winning couple made a decision.

701
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:30,075
Kwang Soo and Joy decided to...

702
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,310
stay as a couple.

703
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:33,850
(They stay as a couple.)

704
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:37,080
(Will they stay as a couple?)

705
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,350
It's the case that we talked about.

706
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,260
- Is it possible? - It is.

707
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,090
(Is it more likely that they're both citizens?)

708
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:47,465
(The first room of truth ends.)

709
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:50,500
- Gosh. - Gosh, wake up.

710
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:51,500
You're a thief.

711
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:53,070
Stop being a thief.

712
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:54,770
You're a thief.

713
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,140
Goodness.

714
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:58,470
What's wrong with you, thief? You're a thief.

715
00:24:58,477 --> 00:24:59,570
I'm not either.

716
00:24:59,578 --> 00:25:00,610
You're a thief.

717
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:02,240
(She's interested in the thieves' fight.)

718
00:25:02,248 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm sure that Joy and Kwang Soo are thieves.

719
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,350
Why?

720
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:07,680
(So Min proposes the idea that Joy and Kwang Soo are thieves.)

721
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:10,220
I heard Joy say it in passing.

722
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:12,020
When there weren't cameras, she told Kwang Soo,

723
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:13,090
"What do we do?"

724
00:25:13,092 --> 00:25:15,320
(So Min makes a report.)

725
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,320
We can be citizens.

726
00:25:16,328 --> 00:25:17,890
- "What do we do?" - We can be...

727
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,530
- I heard her. - That's incredible.

728
00:25:19,531 --> 00:25:21,200
What's incredible?

729
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,560
If they're citizens,

730
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:26,930
they don't have to come out looking upset.

731
00:25:26,939 --> 00:25:28,940
- What is it? - Someone could see them.

732
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,710
- I'm hungry. - Do you smell the food?

733
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,510
- It's jjajangmyeon. - It's definitely jjajangmyeon.

734
00:25:33,512 --> 00:25:35,080
Yes, it's driving me crazy.

735
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm about to go crazy.

736
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,110
- It smells like jjajangmyeon. - Jjajangmyeon and pickled radish.

737
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:40,310
It's driving me crazy.

738
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,820
(For lunch, warm jjajangmyeon is ready.)

739
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,680
I'm hungry.

740
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,690
(There's also tangsuyuk.)

741
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,420
Next mission is one round each for male and female.

742
00:25:48,427 --> 00:25:50,220
It's a food mission.

743
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:53,260
It's the total amount of time that the couple finishes eating.

744
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,600
The couple that eats the fastest...

745
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,235
- wins. - Can you eat fast?

746
00:25:56,402 --> 00:25:58,070
Do we have to do that?

747
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,100
The couple to finish last will lose.

748
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:01,970
- You can't do it? - I can do it.

749
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,770
The first round is A Curious Taste of Black.

750
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:07,110
(A round for male members, A Curious Taste of Black)

751
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,775
(We like the name.)

752
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,150
(He gets excited.)

753
00:26:12,151 --> 00:26:14,645
(Once you bite)

754
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,020
(He controls his excitement.)

755
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:18,050
I was just being excited.

756
00:26:18,057 --> 00:26:19,720
You should have fun during your free time.

757
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:23,060
I'm sorry, but I don't have time to have fun right now.

758
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:25,125
Jae Seok is busy these days.

759
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:27,060
I have no time to have fun at home.

760
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,000
- I know that. - At home,

761
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm very busy.

762
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:33,300
- Do you take care of your child? - Yes, I'm busy as a bee.

763
00:26:33,305 --> 00:26:35,200
When my wife calls, I go to her.

764
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:36,500
When my child calls me, I go to him.

765
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,710
- When the baby cries? - Then I go to her.

766
00:26:38,711 --> 00:26:40,310
You take care of the baby when she cries.

767
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,510
- He's so kind. - You must be busy.

768
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:44,580
(There's one person who stays silent.)

769
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:47,645
- I see. - I'm very busy, but...

770
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,250
I envy you.

771
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,520
- Really? - I envy you.

772
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:51,620
(He's envious of Jae Seok for being busy with his family.)

773
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:53,850
Jong Kook.

774
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:58,090
(I want to stop working out alone.)

775
00:26:58,097 --> 00:27:00,090
I seriously told him.

776
00:27:00,099 --> 00:27:02,030
If he wants to, he must make an effort.

777
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:03,100
That's true.

778
00:27:03,102 --> 00:27:04,100
It's true.

779
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:06,300
The first round is for men.

780
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:07,400
(Men's round starts now.)

781
00:27:07,406 --> 00:27:09,200
Female members will have their eyes covered...

782
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:12,210
and stand behind their partners and feed them jjajangmyeon.

783
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,580
As three teams play, we'll count how long it takes to finish a bowl.

784
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:17,945
We'll total the time.

785
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,350
- You like noodles. - I love noodles.

786
00:27:20,352 --> 00:27:22,850
You know how much I like noodles, right?

787
00:27:22,855 --> 00:27:24,050
Okay.

788
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,620
I'm not good at it.

789
00:27:25,624 --> 00:27:27,090
- I eat a lot. Don't worry. - Really?

790
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:28,220
I like eating.

791
00:27:28,227 --> 00:27:30,360
Don't do anything strange just because you're a thief.

792
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:34,625
Ji Hyo, we need to switch partners.

793
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,760
Give me a big mouthful.

794
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:38,400
(Teamwork is key.)

795
00:27:38,404 --> 00:27:39,670
Can we mix them first?

796
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,300
It's warm. Look at the steam.

797
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:43,470
- You're right. - Look at that.

798
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:44,710
(Oily and steamy)

799
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,610
This is the delicious kind.

800
00:27:46,612 --> 00:27:48,610
The noodles look great.

801
00:27:48,614 --> 00:27:49,910
- Get ready. - Where's your mouth?

802
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:51,410
- Get ready. - It's here. Wait a minute.

803
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:53,810
Does it not fit his neck?

804
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:55,820
(What about this couple?)

805
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:56,950
(What?)

806
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,585
What's wrong?

807
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,090
(She covers Seok Jin's eyes.)

808
00:28:00,092 --> 00:28:02,090
- Gosh. - You need to cover your eyes.

809
00:28:02,094 --> 00:28:03,590
My eyes?

810
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:05,160
(It's me who should cover my eyes.)

811
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:07,160
- You cover your own eyes. - Hey.

812
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:08,500
Why are you covering mine?

813
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,000
Ji Hyo should cover hers.

814
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:11,570
- What are you doing? - This thief is so...

815
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,230
- Hey, thief. - What's wrong with you?

816
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:15,700
- I thought... - When she covered his eyes,

817
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:17,840
he let her. He didn't budge.

818
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,970
He was looking for his chopsticks.

819
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:23,310
Goodness. My eyes...

820
00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,510
(They're a couple with great teamwork.)

821
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,510
They work so well together.

822
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:28,050
Why did you cover my eyes?

823
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,080
Practice with the chopsticks.

824
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:30,080
Men will eat.

825
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:32,620
Why did you break the chopsticks like this?

826
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:34,720
(She complains.)

827
00:28:34,726 --> 00:28:36,590
Can you give us another pair?

828
00:28:36,595 --> 00:28:37,960
(He loses 10 points on his slavery skills.)

829
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:41,330
I've been watching Irene.

830
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,400
She's never satisfied with what Se Chan does.

831
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:45,200
She keeps complaining under her breath.

832
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:48,235
(It's hard to keep up with her.)

833
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:49,400
Get ready.

834
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,570
- Here we go. - Here we go.

835
00:28:51,577 --> 00:28:52,570
- Let's show them. - Here we go.

836
00:28:52,578 --> 00:28:54,210
We're Song Ji Seok Jin.

837
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:55,980
- Get ready. - Song Ji Seok Jin.

838
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:57,915
Start.

839
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:00,185
All right, go.

840
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:02,950
(They eat a lot as soon as they start.)

841
00:29:02,955 --> 00:29:04,685
Go.

842
00:29:07,593 --> 00:29:10,225
I thought Se Chan was eating by himself.

843
00:29:10,362 --> 00:29:12,090
(They work well together.)

844
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:14,365
I thought he was cheating.

845
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:17,295
So Min and Jae Seok work well together.

846
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:20,230
(When So Min gives him a big bite,)

847
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:24,735
(Jae Seok takes it all in one go.)

848
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:29,480
(Song Ji Seok Jin had trouble from the start.)

849
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:33,610
(She feeds him quickly, but he can't keep up.)

850
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,585
She wants to switch her partner so badly.

851
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:39,320
Hey, hey.

852
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:42,020
- Eat. - She doesn't stop moving.

853
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,725
She keeps going.

854
00:29:44,229 --> 00:29:45,430
Irene is very good.

855
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,725
This isn't easy.

856
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,000
Jae Seok's team is the quickest.

857
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,860
- Really? - No way.

858
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:53,835
- No way. - Seok Jin's team is the dirtiest.

859
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:57,240
Swallow it without chewing.

860
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:58,910
Irene has her eyes covered.

861
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,510
She seems kinder than ever before.

862
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,215
(She seems kinder than ever before.)

863
00:30:02,915 --> 00:30:04,080
(She complains less with her eyes covered.)

864
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,315
She's doing well.

865
00:30:06,818 --> 00:30:08,620
(The blindfold makes Irene kind.)

866
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,850
She's very warm.

867
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,125
(The blindfold makes Irene kind.)

868
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:15,690
- Eat. - I think he finished eating.

869
00:30:15,694 --> 00:30:17,660
- He finished eating. - You have some left.

870
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:18,790
- Jae Seok. - I can't see.

871
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:20,790
- Hold the bowl. - I can't get the noodles.

872
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,230
That's it.

873
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,500
Se Chan is almost done.

874
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:26,565
(The two couples spurt at the last minute.)

875
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,700
- We're done. - I think we're done.

876
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,870
Jae Seok finished.

877
00:30:31,877 --> 00:30:33,240
(Jae Seok and So Min clear the mission.)

878
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,540
- Jae Seok. - Good job.

879
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,510
- Jae Seok. - The noodles are all on the table.

880
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:40,480
He has to finish the food dropped on the table.

881
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:43,120
(Did we spill a lot?)

882
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:46,355
(Grabbing)

883
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:50,125
(She feeds him with her hand.)

884
00:30:50,295 --> 00:30:51,530
Ji Hyo.

885
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,530
(He tastes her hand.)

886
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:54,160
That's incredible.

887
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,330
Is that necessary?

888
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:56,560
(Her ambition is impressive.)

889
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,900
- Seriously. - That must be easy.

890
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:03,240
Ji Hyo, come to my house and feed my children for me.

891
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,240
(He refers to Dream and So Wool.)

892
00:31:05,243 --> 00:31:08,380
- They don't eat. - Eat!

893
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,140
Open your mouth!

894
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:11,280
Seok Jin is done.

895
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,310
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo have completed the mission.)

896
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,410
Seok Jin is like a vacuum cleaner.

897
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,420
Lastly...

898
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,480
Why are you so slow?

899
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:17,990
Continue!

900
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,620
Se Chan is slower than I expected.

901
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,190
He is. What's wrong?

902
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:23,695
Are you done?

903
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,030
- Se Chan is done. - He's done.

904
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,290
Poor Seok Jin.

905
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:28,430
Okay. So Min.

906
00:31:28,433 --> 00:31:30,465
- Jae Seok. - Good work.

907
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,170
Why are you so slow?

908
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,570
It was hard.

909
00:31:33,572 --> 00:31:34,570
(Se Chan says it was hard.)

910
00:31:34,573 --> 00:31:37,500
(He's being suspicious.)

911
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:40,110
(He confidently said he loves food.)

912
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:43,580
(In the beginning, he was very fast.)

913
00:31:43,582 --> 00:31:45,150
(But in the end, he finished last.)

914
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,650
- Are you a thief? - No.

915
00:31:46,652 --> 00:31:49,620
(Suspicious)

916
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:50,680
(Se Chan is suspicious.)

917
00:31:50,689 --> 00:31:52,120
- He must be a thief. - No.

918
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:53,620
(Did he lose on purpose to stay with his partner?)

919
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:54,990
Good.

920
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,120
Seriously.

921
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,260
Irene, trust me.

922
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:58,690
Please put on your blindfolds.

923
00:31:58,697 --> 00:31:59,890
Ready.

924
00:31:59,898 --> 00:32:01,060
Let's do this, Han Na!

925
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,300
The last time I ate jjajangmyeon...

926
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,330
was on a show.

927
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:05,500
This is the first time since then.

928
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:08,070
Hold on.

929
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:09,740
- I can't believe you. - What happened?

930
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,940
She kept wiping my face,

931
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:13,270
but it's a mole.

932
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:14,880
(She kept wiping my face, but it's a mole.)

933
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,710
(Irene tried to wipe off a mole.)

934
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:20,445
She tried to wipe off a mole.

935
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:23,880
(Irene offered help for the first time.)

936
00:32:23,889 --> 00:32:26,420
(You have some sauce on your face.)

937
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,360
(But in reality...)

938
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,490
Is that a mole?

939
00:32:29,494 --> 00:32:32,490
(She got it wrong.)

940
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:34,490
I can't believe her. It's a mole.

941
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:36,160
What's wrong with you?

942
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:38,330
- I thought it was the sauce. - It's a mole.

943
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:41,500
Irene at least doesn't make you confused.

944
00:32:41,506 --> 00:32:43,270
- It shows who she likes... - She's straightforward.

945
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,400
and doesn't like.

946
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:45,870
- In A, here. - Put on your blindfolds.

947
00:32:45,877 --> 00:32:47,340
- Hold the chopsticks. - Ready.

948
00:32:47,345 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm nervous.

949
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:49,840
- Me too. - Ready.

950
00:32:49,848 --> 00:32:51,980
- Let's show them, Joy. - Let's show them.

951
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:53,480
- Ready. - Try to pick them up.

952
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:54,880
It's okay to do that.

953
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,150
Start.

954
00:32:56,154 --> 00:32:58,450
With some sauce, it's easy to eat.

955
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:00,785
Gosh, look at Kwang Soo.

956
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,120
(Kwang Soo is definitely the fastest.)

957
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:04,020
Kwang Soo is so fast.

958
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:05,060
Gosh.

959
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:06,760
- But he's eating on his own. - He's eating on his own.

960
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,130
This is not okay.

961
00:33:08,133 --> 00:33:09,400
You can't do that.

962
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:12,870
(He doesn't even need his partner.)

963
00:33:12,871 --> 00:33:15,070
You can't do that. Haha is fast too.

964
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,670
We don't know yet.

965
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:17,970
- He's so fast. - He's really fast.

966
00:33:17,976 --> 00:33:20,305
(He is like a vacuum cleaner.)

967
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:21,680
Jong Kook is catching up too.

968
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,280
But...

969
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:24,610
(He finishes half the bowl in one bite.)

970
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:26,580
- Jong Kook. - Where is his mouth?

971
00:33:26,585 --> 00:33:28,120
(1st place, 3rd place, 2nd place)

972
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,550
Haha is unexpectedly fast.

973
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:30,720
- Haha. - High up...

974
00:33:30,722 --> 00:33:32,720
- What's going on? - High up...

975
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:34,860
It's unbelievable.

976
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,160
Look at Haha.

977
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,260
(Han Na moves her hand like a machine,)

978
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:38,290
(and Haha slurps down the noodles like a vacuum cleaner.)

979
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,430
- Haha is almost done. - Unbelievable.

980
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:42,160
It even looks neat.

981
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,630
Haha is almost done.

982
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:44,930
He's almost done.

983
00:33:44,936 --> 00:33:46,500
(Haha is finishing up the sauce.)

984
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,840
He's done. Finished!

985
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,905
Haha is finished.

986
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:52,510
Are we finished?

987
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:54,240
Did we finish first?

988
00:33:54,246 --> 00:33:55,510
He's done.

989
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:57,480
- Finished! - Haha is finished.

990
00:33:57,482 --> 00:33:58,610
(Their speed and teamwork deserve an applause.)

991
00:33:58,617 --> 00:33:59,950
Did we finish first?

992
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,450
- You were really fast. - Your left hand.

993
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:03,820
Joy, you can't use your left hand.

994
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:04,990
Are we done?

995
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,520
(As soon as she hears Haha's team is finished,)

996
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:09,120
(Joy starts using her left hand.)

997
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,160
(They're desperate to catch up.)

998
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:13,090
Hey, that's...

999
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:14,730
Kwang Soo. What are you doing?

1000
00:34:14,733 --> 00:34:16,400
(They make you wonder why they're so desperate.)

1001
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:18,000
What are they doing?

1002
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,070
Let me chew it first.

1003
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,670
Has he eaten anything?

1004
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,805
Let me chew it first.

1005
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:24,400
You're done.

1006
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,810
- Jong Kook is done. - Jong Kook is done.

1007
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:26,970
Are we done?

1008
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:28,740
(Jong Kook finishes the bowl in a few minutes.)

1009
00:34:28,747 --> 00:34:30,310
Jong Kook ate it so neatly.

1010
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,650
(Jong Kook's determination deserves respect.)

1011
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,510
Why are you so slow?

1012
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,820
- Kwang Soo is very slow. - He's not finished yet.

1013
00:34:35,821 --> 00:34:37,420
He'll finish last.

1014
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:39,190
- He's done. - You're finished.

1015
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:41,890
(Kwang Soo and Joy finally finish the bowl.)

1016
00:34:41,893 --> 00:34:43,725
Joy needs...

1017
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,090
I think Haha is in first place.

1018
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,790
- Definitely. - He's in first place.

1019
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:50,300
- It's women's round now. - What are they eating?

1020
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,300
In the second round, you're going to eat tangsuyuk.

1021
00:34:52,304 --> 00:34:54,535
(The female members are going to eat tangsuyuk.)

1022
00:34:54,773 --> 00:34:56,270
I love tangsuyuk.

1023
00:34:56,274 --> 00:34:58,740
When the female member breaks plastic wrap with her face,

1024
00:34:58,743 --> 00:35:01,940
her partner will feed her tangsuyuk. Repeat it five times...

1025
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:05,280
and whistle. The time the female member takes...

1026
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:07,550
will be combined with the time her partner took in the first round.

1027
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:08,820
Okay.

1028
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,350
Here we go.

1029
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,550
So Min is very good.

1030
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,020
Bite off the plastic wrap.

1031
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,720
Let's beat Joy.

1032
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,820
So Min, just keep going.

1033
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:17,820
Don't miss the funny part.

1034
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:18,960
There was a funny part.

1035
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:22,260
(What funny part?)

1036
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:23,460
Se Chan said, "Let's do this!"

1037
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:25,195
Irene said, "You startled me."

1038
00:35:25,604 --> 00:35:27,200
Don't miss it.

1039
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:28,970
(You saw it?)

1040
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:31,300
(A few minutes earlier)

1041
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:32,640
- Let's do this! - You startled me.

1042
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,970
(You startled me.)

1043
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:36,210
(It was a funny moment.)

1044
00:35:36,214 --> 00:35:37,810
(You saw it?)

1045
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:38,980
Irene...

1046
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:40,810
I don't know anymore.

1047
00:35:40,819 --> 00:35:43,120
Just split up. You're making everyone uncomfortable.

1048
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:45,955
- I want to change my partner. - They're a good team.

1049
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:47,850
I love this combination.

1050
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:49,190
Here we go.

1051
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:50,820
Ready.

1052
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:51,930
And...

1053
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,560
(They have to break through the plastic wrap to eat.)

1054
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,330
(The tangsuyuk mission starts.)

1055
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,065
Get in there.

1056
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,530
(Joy breaks 1.)

1057
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:00,205
Joy.

1058
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,170
Break the next one.

1059
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,270
(Okay.)

1060
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,270
(Breaking)

1061
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:08,540
(Kwang Soo and Joy have finished 2.)

1062
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:09,840
They're fast.

1063
00:36:09,848 --> 00:36:11,810
Get in there. Use your forehead.

1064
00:36:11,816 --> 00:36:12,880
Break through.

1065
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,320
Keep going. There you go.

1066
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,780
(Irene finally breaks 1.)

1067
00:36:16,788 --> 00:36:17,820
Eat it.

1068
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,625
Good.

1069
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,060
So Min, use your forehead.

1070
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,090
Use your forehead.

1071
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,520
(What is So Min doing?)

1072
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:25,990
Use your forehead.

1073
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:27,060
So Min.

1074
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,430
There you go. Eat now.

1075
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:29,800
- Eat it. - Chew it.

1076
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,665
- Hurry up. - So Min.

1077
00:36:31,836 --> 00:36:33,970
- You whistle after eating five? - Yes.

1078
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:36,770
Joy, you have a big mouth, but you eat very slowly.

1079
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:39,310
(Joy pauses and chews the food.)

1080
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:40,670
Get in there.

1081
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,445
There you go.

1082
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:44,510
Keep going.

1083
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:45,850
Break through!

1084
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,880
Break it!

1085
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,180
Way to go, Irene!

1086
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:49,780
Keep going!

1087
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:52,115
Break through.

1088
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,690
Break it. Okay.

1089
00:36:53,692 --> 00:36:54,960
(Irene breaks the 2nd plastic wrap with her whole body.)

1090
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,020
Eat it. Chew it.

1091
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,190
So Min, come on.

1092
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,860
(So Min is battling with the plastic wrap.)

1093
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:00,930
Keep going.

1094
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:03,595
Break it!

1095
00:37:03,668 --> 00:37:04,660
So Min, break it!

1096
00:37:04,669 --> 00:37:06,130
(Biting)

1097
00:37:06,137 --> 00:37:07,230
So Min.

1098
00:37:07,238 --> 00:37:09,635
Isn't that Voldemort?

1099
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,840
(She looks just like Voldemort.)

1100
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:14,740
(She looks like the worst villain.)

1101
00:37:14,746 --> 00:37:16,240
So Min. There you go.

1102
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:18,210
There you go.

1103
00:37:18,216 --> 00:37:19,350
(Voldemort has finished 2.)

1104
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:20,650
So Min.

1105
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,785
So Min, you're amazing.

1106
00:37:23,488 --> 00:37:24,580
So Min.

1107
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:26,620
So Min is incredible.

1108
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:29,995
(Let me break the plastic wrap now.)

1109
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:31,730
So Min, break it!

1110
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,960
Can you eat?

1111
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:34,660
(Joy has finished 3.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1112
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:36,660
Eat the tangsuyuk first.

1113
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:37,660
Eat it.

1114
00:37:37,669 --> 00:37:39,170
Keep going.

1115
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,630
Irene is competitive. I love it!

1116
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,640
Irene, what are you doing?

1117
00:37:43,641 --> 00:37:44,670
She has some tangsuyuk in her mouth.

1118
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:47,270
(Irene is challenged by Joy.)

1119
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,010
(Breaking)

1120
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:50,040
Okay.

1121
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:52,245
(Irene has finished 3.)

1122
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:53,810
(Joy, take your time.)

1123
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:55,380
Eat it.

1124
00:37:55,387 --> 00:37:59,590
(No. I should get moving too.)

1125
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:03,090
(The family battle starts.)

1126
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,390
Joy.

1127
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:06,265
I'm sorry.

1128
00:38:06,731 --> 00:38:08,430
I can't break it.

1129
00:38:08,433 --> 00:38:10,500
Put it down.

1130
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:13,465
- Joy has only 1 left. - Joy has only 1 left.

1131
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,300
Joy has finished four.

1132
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,470
Get in there!

1133
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:18,070
Good!

1134
00:38:18,076 --> 00:38:20,870
(Irene is catching up.)

1135
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:23,180
(But Joy breaks her 5th plastic wrap.)

1136
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:24,180
Joy.

1137
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:26,285
Joy has such a big mouth.

1138
00:38:27,252 --> 00:38:29,755
- There you go. - She's good.

1139
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:33,120
- Now you have to eat fast. - It's important.

1140
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:35,290
So Min. Keep going.

1141
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:37,755
You look like a mess right now.

1142
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:39,490
So Min, eat this.

1143
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,230
(She has some food left in her mouth.)

1144
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:42,700
Keep going.

1145
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,000
(She continues with the food in her mouth.)

1146
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:46,530
So Min. There you go.

1147
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,770
You're so good. Why didn't you do better before?

1148
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,240
It's okay.

1149
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:51,940
(She spills some juices.)

1150
00:38:51,943 --> 00:38:53,975
It's okay to spill some juices.

1151
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,010
One more to go.

1152
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,110
Keep going!

1153
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,150
- You're so good. - Break it. Keep going!

1154
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:03,355
Break it!

1155
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:04,820
Break it, So Min!

1156
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:05,890
(So Min is amazing.)

1157
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,290
So Min, come on.

1158
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:08,590
- You're almost there. - You're almost there.

1159
00:39:08,593 --> 00:39:10,295
You're almost there.

1160
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:12,360
Isn't that tangsuyuk?

1161
00:39:12,363 --> 00:39:13,590
So Min, break it.

1162
00:39:13,598 --> 00:39:14,790
Break it.

1163
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:15,860
So Min, keep going.

1164
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:18,295
You're almost there. Break it.

1165
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:20,305
She's the best.

1166
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,300
- There you go. - You're almost there.

1167
00:39:22,307 --> 00:39:23,740
(She has finally broken 5.)

1168
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,310
There you go. So Min.

1169
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,470
This will go down in history.

1170
00:39:26,478 --> 00:39:27,870
(Your struggle today will go down in history.)

1171
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:31,240
(Congratulations on entering the Comedy Hall of Fame.)

1172
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:33,250
(She has given up her looks for the mission.)

1173
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:36,585
(We support actress and comedian Jeon So Min's endeavors.)

1174
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:37,850
This will go down in history.

1175
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:39,920
(She adds a page to the history of comedy.)

1176
00:39:39,924 --> 00:39:44,360
(They applaud her to show their respect.)

1177
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:45,730
- There you go. - Irene is going to whistle.

1178
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:46,760
(Irene is going to try to whistle.)

1179
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:48,430
- Whistle. - Now they have to whistle.

1180
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:50,095
Whistle.

1181
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,965
She whistled.

1182
00:39:53,104 --> 00:39:55,340
(Irene completes the tangsuyuk mission.)

1183
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,870
It's Joy's turn.

1184
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,370
Joy.

1185
00:39:58,376 --> 00:39:59,840
(Joy completes the tangsuyuk mission.)

1186
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,110
So Min.

1187
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:02,440
Whistle.

1188
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,210
Isn't she that girl?

1189
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:07,715
The one with Se Chan...

1190
00:40:07,986 --> 00:40:10,120
You mean the mixture of me and So Min?

1191
00:40:10,121 --> 00:40:12,415
She looks like that mixture.

1192
00:40:12,557 --> 00:40:13,690
The mixture of me and So Min.

1193
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,290
Where have you been since the opening?

1194
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,790
(We missed you.)

1195
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:19,230
So Min, eat.

1196
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,760
- So Min. - It's her, isn't it?

1197
00:40:20,765 --> 00:40:22,495
(Thank you for having me again.)

1198
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:24,660
Gosh, my stomach hurts.

1199
00:40:24,669 --> 00:40:26,430
(She has added a page to the history of funny faces.)

1200
00:40:26,437 --> 00:40:28,305
She's whistled.

1201
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:31,140
(Good job, So Min.)

1202
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:32,270
- She's amazing. - So Min.

1203
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:33,940
You finished last, but you were the best.

1204
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:36,140
- It was so funny. - I'm so touched.

1205
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:37,775
(After many funny moments, the game is over.)

1206
00:40:38,016 --> 00:40:39,150
Here we go.

1207
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,710
- Ji Hyo. - Let's do this.

1208
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,585
I have to change my partner.

1209
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:45,350
I have to change my partner. Let's do this.

1210
00:40:45,356 --> 00:40:47,350
If you do your best, you'll look pretty.

1211
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:49,090
- It's okay. - Han Na, let's go.

1212
00:40:49,093 --> 00:40:50,790
- So Min is weird, - I'm nervous.

1213
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,790
- but you're weird too. - No. Hold on.

1214
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,130
- What should I do? - You can do this.

1215
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:56,460
Ready.

1216
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,870
(Start)

1217
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,565
Look at Han Na.

1218
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:03,140
(Both Han Na and In A break 1 right away.)

1219
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:04,240
Look at Han Na.

1220
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:06,110
Way to go!

1221
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,210
Look at Han Na.

1222
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:09,880
(She takes a big bite.)

1223
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,150
- Han Na's eyes completely changed. - That's good.

1224
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,915
- The look in her eyes changed. - She's doing well.

1225
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,920
- Go. - Eat it.

1226
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:18,480
She's fast.

1227
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:20,285
She's doing well.

1228
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:22,920
- In A is doing well. - Here you go.

1229
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:25,890
In A is doing well.

1230
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,090
Ji Hyo.

1231
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:28,190
(He's impressed by In A and Han Na.)

1232
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,360
Wait a minute.

1233
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,500
Hurry.

1234
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:34,670
(This is difficult.)

1235
00:41:34,672 --> 00:41:35,970
That's good. Here you go.

1236
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,440
(She barely manages to break 1.)

1237
00:41:38,443 --> 00:41:40,040
Eat slowly.

1238
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:41,710
(The others are so fast.)

1239
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:43,040
Look.

1240
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:44,340
Hurry up.

1241
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:45,380
That's good.

1242
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,250
(She struggles.)

1243
00:41:47,252 --> 00:41:48,550
That's good.

1244
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:50,150
Eat slowly.

1245
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:51,420
They're so ambitious.

1246
00:41:51,422 --> 00:41:53,290
Go through it.

1247
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,490
All you have to do is whistle.

1248
00:41:55,493 --> 00:41:57,020
(Han Na takes another wrapped frame.)

1249
00:41:57,028 --> 00:41:58,120
That's good.

1250
00:41:58,129 --> 00:42:00,590
(This looks familiar.)

1251
00:42:00,598 --> 00:42:02,100
- You look so funny. - It's Hwang Bi Hong.

1252
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,260
That was hilarious.

1253
00:42:03,268 --> 00:42:05,060
(Hwang Bi Hong appears unexpectedly.)

1254
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:06,770
What's going on with Han Na?

1255
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:08,970
That was Hwang Bi Hong.

1256
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:10,770
It's what I wore for Halloween.

1257
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:12,370
- Han Na. - Hurry.

1258
00:42:12,377 --> 00:42:13,440
Come on.

1259
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:15,240
We don't have time to laugh.

1260
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,380
(She goes through 3 frames.)

1261
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:20,580
- She can't get through it. - In A.

1262
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,650
(While Hwang Bi Hong passes,)

1263
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:23,350
In A.

1264
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,450
(someone else appears.)

1265
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,090
- In A. - In A.

1266
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,490
- She got it. - In A.

1267
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:29,490
She got through it.

1268
00:42:29,494 --> 00:42:31,760
In A's face startled me.

1269
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:33,865
I thought it was a stranger.

1270
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:35,230
Don't say that.

1271
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:36,330
It's okay.

1272
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:37,960
- Jong Kook, that's worse. - What?

1273
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:39,130
What's wrong, In A?

1274
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:40,370
You look pretty.

1275
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,340
- Just do your best. - Her face looked really compressed.

1276
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,000
Just do your best.

1277
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:45,970
It's okay as long as you work hard.

1278
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,170
Okay, that's good.

1279
00:42:47,178 --> 00:42:49,440
(When In A goes through one, Han Na does too.)

1280
00:42:49,447 --> 00:42:51,480
- Chew well. - That's good.

1281
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:53,385
All right, that's good.

1282
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,150
(The one who whistles first will win.)

1283
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:56,550
She ate five of them.

1284
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:57,750
Time out.

1285
00:42:57,755 --> 00:42:59,385
She'll whistle now.

1286
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:00,590
Hurry up.

1287
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:01,620
She did it.

1288
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:03,290
(Han Na clears the mission first.)

1289
00:43:03,294 --> 00:43:05,590
- That's impressive. - She didn't take one minute.

1290
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:07,625
Didn't I do well?

1291
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,460
She did it. Okay.

1292
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:12,370
(The only person left is...)

1293
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,800
You did a good job.

1294
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:16,840
Good job.

1295
00:43:16,841 --> 00:43:19,270
In A did well. She works hard.

1296
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,470
Goodness.

1297
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:22,180
She's not an ace.

1298
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,115
(He's frustrated.)

1299
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:26,580
(She can't argue with him.)

1300
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,210
- What's going on? - How can you say that?

1301
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,480
Seok Jin.

1302
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,920
Why would you hurt her feelings?

1303
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,420
- Listen. - She should play...

1304
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:36,260
- She's good at certain things. - She should play her part.

1305
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,060
She should be better than that.

1306
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:39,430
She can't be good at everything.

1307
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,290
Of course not.

1308
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:42,760
(Whistling)

1309
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:43,760
- Okay. - I did it.

1310
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:44,960
Okay.

1311
00:43:44,969 --> 00:43:47,700
(What are the couples' final records?)

1312
00:43:47,705 --> 00:43:49,975
We're the winner.

1313
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,340
I'll announce the winner first.

1314
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,240
- Isn't it Haha and Han Na? - Right.

1315
00:43:55,246 --> 00:43:56,480
Right?

1316
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,215
They were both quick.

1317
00:43:58,249 --> 00:44:00,350
It's worth hoping for.

1318
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:01,480
Hard work will pay off.

1319
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:02,580
The winner is...

1320
00:44:02,587 --> 00:44:05,390
(The winning team gets a chance to switch partners.)

1321
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:06,450
The winner is...

1322
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:07,750
Haha and Han Na.

1323
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:08,860
(Haha and Han Na place first.)

1324
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:10,660
I knew it.

1325
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:12,460
They were so fast.

1326
00:44:12,463 --> 00:44:14,030
Both of them were fast.

1327
00:44:14,031 --> 00:44:15,930
They were outstanding.

1328
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:18,100
He finished jjajangmyeon in 44 seconds.

1329
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:19,800
She took 1 minute 55 seconds to pierce the plastic wrap frames.

1330
00:44:19,804 --> 00:44:21,070
Both of them were the fastest.

1331
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:23,270
Did you finish in 44 seconds?

1332
00:44:23,274 --> 00:44:25,000
That's incredible.

1333
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:27,540
I'll announce the loser.

1334
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:28,540
The loser is...

1335
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:29,640
(He announces the loser.)

1336
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:31,640
- It's Seok Jin and Ji Hyo. - Why?

1337
00:44:31,649 --> 00:44:33,480
What's the point of knowing about them?

1338
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:35,145
Why?

1339
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:36,680
(They're overly relieved.)

1340
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:40,125
(We didn't place last.)

1341
00:44:40,558 --> 00:44:42,890
It'd been great if it had been Kwang Soo.

1342
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:44,520
The losing team,

1343
00:44:44,529 --> 00:44:46,190
Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

1344
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:48,230
- One of them is a thief. - I know.

1345
00:44:48,232 --> 00:44:50,200
- What's the point? - It's one of them.

1346
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,660
- Is that all? - It's one of them.

1347
00:44:51,669 --> 00:44:52,900
Is this all?

1348
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,770
One of us is a thief.

1349
00:44:54,772 --> 00:44:56,000
(It's not me.)

1350
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,170
She's a thief.

1351
00:44:57,175 --> 00:44:58,700
What's this?

1352
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:00,410
It's pointless.

1353
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:02,110
(Are both of them thieves?)

1354
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:03,710
This couple is...

1355
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:05,510
very relieved.

1356
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:06,880
They were so surprised.

1357
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:09,480
I can't figure out if they're faking it or not.

1358
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,420
- I'm curious about that. - Me too.

1359
00:45:11,422 --> 00:45:12,750
I'm curious.

1360
00:45:12,757 --> 00:45:14,650
They're thieves.

1361
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:17,890
I think they're both citizens.

1362
00:45:17,895 --> 00:45:20,290
They're worried about someone taking away the partner.

1363
00:45:20,298 --> 00:45:21,860
That's why they control their expression...

1364
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:24,200
and stay suspicious.

1365
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:26,700
(Is Jong Kook's guess correct?)

1366
00:45:26,704 --> 00:45:29,270
I'll announce the identity of your partner.

1367
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,470
We'll start with Joy.

1368
00:45:30,475 --> 00:45:32,470
Joy is a citizen.

1369
00:45:32,477 --> 00:45:35,610
(Joy is a citizen indeed.)

1370
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:37,540
Kwang Soo.

1371
00:45:37,548 --> 00:45:38,680
He's a citizen.

1372
00:45:38,683 --> 00:45:43,185
(Kwang Soo is also a citizen.)

1373
00:45:43,621 --> 00:45:46,020
(As Jong Kook guessed, they're both citizens.)

1374
00:45:46,023 --> 00:45:47,990
Will you switch partners?

1375
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:49,860
Or stay being a couple?

1376
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:52,060
What should we do? We'll stay.

1377
00:45:52,063 --> 00:45:54,495
- We'll stay as a couple. - Will you?

1378
00:45:55,032 --> 00:45:56,760
We should be careful.

1379
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:59,030
Let's say that people find out we're both citizens.

1380
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:00,770
If a couple with a thief...

1381
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:02,340
wins,

1382
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,070
they'll try to switch partners with us.

1383
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:05,840
We're both citizens.

1384
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:08,470
We have to pretend like we're both thieves.

1385
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,645
(Let's pretend to be thieves.)

1386
00:46:11,883 --> 00:46:13,910
- They're out. - They argued.

1387
00:46:13,918 --> 00:46:14,950
They argued.

1388
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:16,650
They look upset.

1389
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,655
Are both of them thieves?

1390
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:23,260
That's why they control expression and stay suspicious.

1391
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:25,490
- I see. - A thief could separate them.

1392
00:46:25,496 --> 00:46:28,225
The winning couple.

1393
00:46:28,232 --> 00:46:30,600
Haha and Han Na will go to the room of truth.

1394
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,530
You'll find out each other's identity...

1395
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:36,035
and decide whether to change partners or not.

1396
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:37,440
If they change partners,

1397
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:39,640
it's likely that they'll switch with them.

1398
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,070
(If either Haha or Han Na is a thief...)

1399
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:43,215
This is exciting.

1400
00:46:43,414 --> 00:46:44,940
- That's possible. - Right.

1401
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:46,110
That's possible.

1402
00:46:46,117 --> 00:46:47,150
- Okay. - Okay.

1403
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:50,020
(What will Haha and Han Na decide?)

1404
00:46:50,021 --> 00:46:54,425
(What is their identity?)

1405
00:46:55,226 --> 00:46:57,960
Both of them can be thieves, or it's one of them.

1406
00:46:57,962 --> 00:46:59,960
- Aren't you a thief? - I am not.

1407
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:01,590
- You're not? - I'm not.

1408
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,660
Me neither.

1409
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,860
(Seok Jin is completely honest.)

1410
00:47:03,868 --> 00:47:05,600
You're a thief.

1411
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:08,235
She's driving me crazy.

1412
00:47:08,406 --> 00:47:09,600
My goodness.

1413
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:10,870
Ji Hyo is an actress.

1414
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,975
Her acting is classic.

1415
00:47:13,377 --> 00:47:14,440
Wait.

1416
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,240
(He looks so awkward.)

1417
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,940
- Was that a line? - Was it?

1418
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:19,110
Did you just say a line?

1419
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:20,880
"Her acting is classic"?

1420
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:23,120
- Did you write it at home? - "Her acting is classic"?

1421
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,050
He did.

1422
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:27,885
- She acts so well. - Goodness.

1423
00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:30,160
- They're coming out. - Let's read their faces.

1424
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:31,590
(Haha and Han Na come out.)

1425
00:47:31,596 --> 00:47:34,930
(They checked each other's identity.)

1426
00:47:34,932 --> 00:47:38,000
(Han Na looks upset.)

1427
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:41,030
(Are they acting, or are they shocked by the result?)

1428
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:42,340
What's your decision?

1429
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,970
What happened?

1430
00:47:43,975 --> 00:47:46,410
Here's the winning couple's decision.

1431
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,440
Haha and Han Na.

1432
00:47:48,446 --> 00:47:50,440
(Did they decide to stay as a couple or change partners?)

1433
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:51,940
They'll switch partners with Kwang Soo and Joy.

1434
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:53,710
- See? - One of them is a thief.

1435
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:54,980
(They switch with Kwang Soo and Joy.)

1436
00:47:54,986 --> 00:47:58,920
(The citizen couple is separated.)

1437
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,820
It's incredible.

1438
00:48:00,825 --> 00:48:01,820
This must be a tactic.

1439
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:03,590
One of them is definitely a thief.

1440
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:04,760
It's definite.

1441
00:48:04,762 --> 00:48:07,460
I had to change partners.

1442
00:48:07,465 --> 00:48:09,030
- Is that so? - I'm serious.

1443
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:12,400
Watch how I behave today and see if I act like a thief.

1444
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:13,530
- Kwang Soo. - I won't.

1445
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:14,630
- Seriously. - You were like a thief.

1446
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:16,240
- It's her. - He was like a thief.

1447
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,670
Han Na's acting improved.

1448
00:48:17,675 --> 00:48:19,410
- No way. - It's true.

1449
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:20,810
That's why she worked hard.

1450
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:23,310
I knew that Haha was good at pretending.

1451
00:48:23,314 --> 00:48:25,280
- I almost got in trouble. - I didn't know he was this good.

1452
00:48:25,282 --> 00:48:26,810
It can't be either of you.

1453
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:27,850
(Their suspicion gets worse.)

1454
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:30,785
As you continue suspecting,

1455
00:48:30,955 --> 00:48:32,150
let's move to the final round.

1456
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:33,620
(Let's move to the final round.)

1457
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:35,350
Is it already the final round?

1458
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,390
(Is it almost over?)

1459
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:38,460
(What if my partner is a thief?)

1460
00:48:38,462 --> 00:48:40,060
Is this the last round?

1461
00:48:40,064 --> 00:48:42,290
- No. - When can we change partners?

1462
00:48:42,299 --> 00:48:43,430
Do we not get another chance?

1463
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:46,970
You have more opportunities...

1464
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:49,440
- than you imagine. - Really? Okay.

1465
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,905
- Let's move to the final round. - Okay.

1466
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:54,210
(Current partner status)

1467
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:56,940
(Joy and Han Na switch partners.)

1468
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:58,040
Are you a thief?

1469
00:48:58,049 --> 00:48:59,550
Why would I be a thief?

1470
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,750
Aren't you a thief?

1471
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:02,750
- Aren't you a thief? - I'm not.

1472
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,680
I really am not.

1473
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:05,820
I promise.

1474
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:08,290
- I swear. Yes. - Is it Han Na?

1475
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:09,520
I'm really not a thief.

1476
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:11,290
- Really? - I'm not.

1477
00:49:11,295 --> 00:49:13,730
Don't trust Haha. He's not trustworthy.

1478
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:15,530
My goodness.

1479
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:16,900
Here we go.

1480
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,600
Here's the last mission and a chance to find out...

1481
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:22,470
your partner's identity and change your partner.

1482
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:24,570
It's Familiar Pirate Roulette Quiz.

1483
00:49:24,575 --> 00:49:27,010
- "Familiar Pirate Roulette"? - "Familiar Pirate Roulette"?

1484
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:28,770
What's Familiar Pirate Roulette Quiz?

1485
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,480
There's a box on top of each table.

1486
00:49:31,482 --> 00:49:33,210
Inside the boxes are...

1487
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:35,110
pirate roulettes of 24 slots, 16 slots,

1488
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,750
and 8 slots randomly.

1489
00:49:37,755 --> 00:49:40,050
The number of knives given depends on...

1490
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:41,950
the difficulty level of the question.

1491
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:43,060
Is this...

1492
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,920
The team to answer correctly...

1493
00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:46,690
will pick another team.

1494
00:49:46,697 --> 00:49:48,760
They find out if any of them is a thief.

1495
00:49:48,766 --> 00:49:51,330
(The winning couple can find out the identity of a couple.)

1496
00:49:51,335 --> 00:49:53,000
- Really? - That's amazing.

1497
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:56,140
The winning couple will stick knives into the other couple's roulette.

1498
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,870
If the pirate pops out,

1499
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:00,345
it's possible to switch partners with that couple.

1500
00:50:00,478 --> 00:50:02,110
It has to pop out, right?

1501
00:50:02,113 --> 00:50:04,410
Is the one with eight slots the best?

1502
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,480
- I'm a citizen. - Right.

1503
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:08,750
- You aren't a thief, right? - I'm not.

1504
00:50:08,753 --> 00:50:10,120
We should get a big one.

1505
00:50:10,121 --> 00:50:11,280
Right.

1506
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,690
If you answer incorrectly,

1507
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:14,890
the person next to you hits you with a squeaky hammer.

1508
00:50:14,892 --> 00:50:16,360
How about we decide...

1509
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,660
by playing rock-paper-scissors?

1510
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:19,760
Where you stand is important.

1511
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:21,760
- Why? Everyone found their spot. - Why not?

1512
00:50:21,766 --> 00:50:22,830
We should decide with rock-paper-scissors.

1513
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,300
Why don't we play Race of Wits?

1514
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:25,870
Let's play Race of Wits.

1515
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,970
Don't say anything if it's not Race of Wits.

1516
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:30,540
- Let's play Race of Wits. - What's wrong with him?

1517
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:32,040
Since when did you like that game?

1518
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:33,040
Pardon?

1519
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:34,340
What's its charm?

1520
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:35,670
Here's what I think.

1521
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:37,410
I played Race of Wits with a small number of people.

1522
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,310
It's so much more fun to play it with a big group.

1523
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:40,380
(It gets addicting with more people.)

1524
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:43,020
Race of Wits is fun with over 10 people.

1525
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,420
Let's play it.

1526
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,020
Just pick the winner.

1527
00:50:46,023 --> 00:50:47,350
- Decide the winner? - Yes.

1528
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:49,490
- Decide the winner. - That sounds good.

1529
00:50:49,493 --> 00:50:51,160
I'll tell you when to start.

1530
00:50:51,162 --> 00:50:52,360
I'll say one.

1531
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:53,760
Start.

1532
00:50:53,764 --> 00:50:55,090
- 1. - 2.

1533
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:56,100
- 3. - 4.

1534
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,730
- 5. - 5.

1535
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:59,170
(In Round 1...)

1536
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,200
- Come on. - Jae Seok and Jong Kook are out.

1537
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:02,940
Okay, okay.

1538
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,670
I like the tension so much.

1539
00:51:04,675 --> 00:51:07,510
Why did I get eliminated first? Goodness.

1540
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:09,040
- Start. - One.

1541
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:11,110
- Two. - For goodness' sake.

1542
00:51:11,115 --> 00:51:12,110
Three.

1543
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:13,110
(Watching Race of Wits fills me with satisfaction.)

1544
00:51:13,117 --> 00:51:15,920
- How nice. - She is good at this.

1545
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,020
- It's time to go. - Four.

1546
00:51:17,021 --> 00:51:18,480
(Even an elimination doesn't make anyone grimace.)

1547
00:51:18,489 --> 00:51:20,020
All right!

1548
00:51:20,024 --> 00:51:21,490
Han Na!

1549
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:25,060
Even those who get eliminated remain happy.

1550
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:26,590
Race of Wits is fun, right?

1551
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:28,290
- It's really fun. - Race of Wits is fun, right?

1552
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:29,530
- It's better than I expected. - It's fun, right?

1553
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,300
- It's exciting. - It's fun with a lot of people.

1554
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:33,470
It would be amazing if it becomes an Olympic event.

1555
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,235
An Olympic event?

1556
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,470
Jae Seok would be in the national team.

1557
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:39,210
- That much is given. - It would be hilarious.

1558
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:41,910
He would practice every day at the athletes' village.

1559
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:44,280
Thank you so much for playing Race of Wits for me.

1560
00:51:44,281 --> 00:51:46,650
- It was fun. - I love Race of Wits.

1561
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,450
I love Race of Wits.

1562
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:51,755
(Korea will win the event in the Olympics someday.)

1563
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:54,020
I love Race of Wits, but the end is disappointing.

1564
00:51:54,024 --> 00:51:55,020
I know.

1565
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:56,120
It ends with rock-paper-scissors.

1566
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:58,060
It makes me go, "Why didn't we play rock-paper-scissors from the start?"

1567
00:51:58,062 --> 00:51:59,230
- That's right. - It's not disappointing.

1568
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,230
Rock-paper-scissors.

1569
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:01,690
It happens.

1570
00:52:01,699 --> 00:52:03,360
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1571
00:52:03,367 --> 00:52:05,100
(Haha wins.)

1572
00:52:05,102 --> 00:52:07,170
Okay!

1573
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,370
Hold on. This doesn't mean we won.

1574
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:11,670
- We are deciding where to stand. - Right?

1575
00:52:11,675 --> 00:52:13,270
- You get to decide where to stand. - That's right.

1576
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:15,410
- You get to decide where to sit. - You get to decide where to sit.

1577
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:17,775
All right. Here is what we will do.

1578
00:52:17,982 --> 00:52:20,810
We must choose the right box. Where we sit is insignificant.

1579
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:22,680
- Let's pick the third one. - The one in the middle?

1580
00:52:22,686 --> 00:52:23,880
Yes.

1581
00:52:23,888 --> 00:52:25,950
Do you think this one will be nice? Okay.

1582
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:27,850
- We will sit here. - Okay.

1583
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:30,820
To our left will be...

1584
00:52:30,828 --> 00:52:32,890
- Se Chan. - Okay.

1585
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:35,960
To our right will be Seok Jin.

1586
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:38,530
- How about the rest? - You can sit anywhere.

1587
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:40,070
- In that case... - Where should we sit?

1588
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,570
You can sit over there.

1589
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:42,900
(Jong Kook's seat is...)

1590
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:44,940
Where should we sit? At the end?

1591
00:52:44,942 --> 00:52:46,645
Okay.

1592
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,810
(Kwang Soo automatically stands up.)

1593
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:49,280
Change my seat.

1594
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,010
- Change my seat. - What?

1595
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:53,310
What? What?

1596
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:54,880
All right.

1597
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:56,580
I will sit here.

1598
00:52:56,587 --> 00:52:58,320
- The seats have been chosen. - Yes.

1599
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:01,190
Please open the box in front of you and check the pirate roulette.

1600
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:03,090
It's better to have less slots to change your partner, right?

1601
00:53:03,093 --> 00:53:04,490
That's right.

1602
00:53:04,495 --> 00:53:06,325
In 1, 2, 3.

1603
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:09,360
No way!

1604
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:11,430
- No way. - Okay.

1605
00:53:11,435 --> 00:53:13,670
- Okay. - This is incredible.

1606
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:15,570
- Look at ours. - Okay.

1607
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:16,570
The ones with more slots are better.

1608
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:19,675
(Kwang Soo wants to escape from Han Na.)

1609
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,045
My goodness.

1610
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:28,750
What is up with your facial expression?

1611
00:53:28,752 --> 00:53:29,850
This is good.

1612
00:53:29,853 --> 00:53:32,580
(It's a big pirate roulette.)

1613
00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:34,220
It's good news!

1614
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:37,390
I can't believe Kwang Soo picked that pirate roulette.

1615
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:38,390
I mean...

1616
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:39,560
(They feel bad for Kwang Soo.)

1617
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,090
I can't believe it went to him.

1618
00:53:41,098 --> 00:53:42,130
Seriously.

1619
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:43,835
(I hoped for a small one.)

1620
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,200
(The number of slots...)

1621
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:47,970
(in each couple's pirate roulette)

1622
00:53:47,972 --> 00:53:51,370
Here comes the 1st question with 3 knives.

1623
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:52,540
- 3 knives. - 3 knives.

1624
00:53:52,543 --> 00:53:55,070
- That's good. - Haha's pirate will pop out.

1625
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:56,480
This is the first question.

1626
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,880
An alcoholic beverage that lessens the effects of a hangover...

1627
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:02,580
is "Hair of the blank" in English.

1628
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,050
What goes in the blank?

1629
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:06,290
"Hair of the blank"? Gosh, I saw this somewhere.

1630
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:08,490
Number one, bird.

1631
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,190
Number two, horse.

1632
00:54:10,194 --> 00:54:12,290
Number three, dog.

1633
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:13,660
Number four, water.

1634
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:14,660
I got it.

1635
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,800
(I got it.)

1636
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,660
Number one, bird.

1637
00:54:18,669 --> 00:54:21,100
- Bird? - It could refer to a woodpecker.

1638
00:54:21,105 --> 00:54:23,100
(It seems like he heard something about a woodpecker.)

1639
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:24,440
(He is certain.)

1640
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:28,470
(Is it correct?)

1641
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:31,115
(Incorrect)

1642
00:54:31,782 --> 00:54:34,680
Hold on. Hold on, hold on.

1643
00:54:34,685 --> 00:54:36,380
- Let's go. - I mean...

1644
00:54:36,387 --> 00:54:38,680
- Seok Jin is to my left. - We will go this way.

1645
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:40,320
(Jong Kook gets to hit Kwang Soo.)

1646
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:41,890
Does Haha get to decide?

1647
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,560
We won.

1648
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,255
Take off your hat.

1649
00:54:47,231 --> 00:54:49,700
Hold on. You have white hair.

1650
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,200
It's flour!

1651
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:54,100
- I see. - I have flour all over my hair.

1652
00:54:54,104 --> 00:54:56,440
I felt bad for a second.

1653
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,570
- It's flour. - Okay.

1654
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,000
I will hit lightly since this is the first round.

1655
00:54:59,009 --> 00:55:01,370
(Thud)

1656
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:02,640
I will hit lightly since this is the first round.

1657
00:55:02,646 --> 00:55:04,040
(It makes him bow his head.)

1658
00:55:04,048 --> 00:55:06,280
My goodness, that startled me.

1659
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:09,050
- The sound wasn't very loud. - I thought it would burst.

1660
00:55:09,053 --> 00:55:11,080
You should get his neck back up.

1661
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:12,480
- That was incredible. - Here.

1662
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:14,755
(The squeaky hammer is intact, but his neck is stuck.)

1663
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,290
- Okay. - It could have been disastrous.

1664
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:21,190
- Okay. - I got it.

1665
00:55:21,198 --> 00:55:22,360
(Now is my chance.)

1666
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,265
Hair of the dog.

1667
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,395
- Number 3, dog. - Number 3.

1668
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,670
All right!

1669
00:55:28,672 --> 00:55:30,170
(It's a colloquial expression that means "Like cures like".)

1670
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:33,640
- There you go. - I didn't think it was the answer.

1671
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:35,910
Come on out and ask about a couple of your choice.

1672
00:55:35,913 --> 00:55:38,775
- Which couple? - Haha's.

1673
00:55:39,016 --> 00:55:40,180
- Haha's? - Yes.

1674
00:55:40,184 --> 00:55:41,885
Okay. Okay.

1675
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:44,120
Haha and Joy.

1676
00:55:44,121 --> 00:55:45,580
(Is there a thief in Haha and Joy couple?)

1677
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,290
In Haha and Joy couple,

1678
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:48,290
(What is Haha's identity?)

1679
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:49,320
there is...

1680
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,560
(What is Haha's identity?)

1681
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:52,195
There is...

1682
00:55:54,598 --> 00:55:56,300
In Haha and Joy couple,

1683
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,300
(What is Haha's identity?)

1684
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:58,600
there is...

1685
00:55:58,602 --> 00:56:00,600
- No thief. - Okay, okay.

1686
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:01,630
Okay.

1687
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:03,900
(Joy is a citizen,)

1688
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:07,005
(so that means Haha is a citizen as well.)

1689
00:56:07,444 --> 00:56:09,575
- Okay, okay. - Okay.

1690
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,010
They now know which couple has a thief.

1691
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:14,380
- Now... - Haha and Joy are safe.

1692
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:15,810
- Okay. - Let's insert our swords there.

1693
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,280
We will insert our swords in Haha and Joy's pirate roulette.

1694
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:19,550
(These citizens have the smallest pirate roulette.)

1695
00:56:19,556 --> 00:56:21,420
In case the pirate pops out,

1696
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:23,890
they will need to pick the safest couple.

1697
00:56:23,894 --> 00:56:25,620
If you want to switch a partner...

1698
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:27,390
We keep our partners if it doesn't pop out, right?

1699
00:56:27,397 --> 00:56:29,060
All right.

1700
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,930
(The pirate doesn't pop out after the first sword.)

1701
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:33,570
It would be so easy for the pirate to pop out.

1702
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,430
- Right? - You have one more sword to go.

1703
00:56:35,439 --> 00:56:37,000
(Not knowing who is a thief, Joy is nervous.)

1704
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:38,705
All right.

1705
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:40,470
- It didn't pop out. - My goodness.

1706
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:42,205
It didn't pop out.

1707
00:56:42,246 --> 00:56:45,510
We don't know if there is a thief in Jae Seok and So Min couple.

1708
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:46,510
- We don't know. - We don't know.

1709
00:56:46,517 --> 00:56:48,780
Then why did you insert the swords in a smallest pirate roulette?

1710
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,020
Why didn't you pick a big one?

1711
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,750
Maybe they asked a question and found out...

1712
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:55,020
- that couple doesn't have a thief. - I see.

1713
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:56,760
You are smart.

1714
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,455
For goodness' sake.

1715
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:03,835
(Does that mean Han Na is a thief?)

1716
00:57:03,901 --> 00:57:06,330
There is a big chance Han Na is a thief.

1717
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:09,540
- What are you talking about? - There is a big chance.

1718
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,570
Hold on.

1719
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:11,970
Here comes the second question.

1720
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:15,440
A caldera lake is a crater lake that forms...

1721
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:17,610
in a volcanic crater...

1722
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:20,410
and has a diameter of 3km or longer.

1723
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:22,380
- That's right. - What does "Caldera" mean...

1724
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:24,350
in Spanish?

1725
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:25,580
Caldera.

1726
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:27,050
Number one, cup.

1727
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:29,220
Number two, cauldron.

1728
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,990
- Cauldron? - Number three, basket.

1729
00:57:31,995 --> 00:57:33,090
Number, plate.

1730
00:57:33,096 --> 00:57:34,790
I got it!

1731
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:37,160
Number two, cauldron.

1732
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,865
What?

1733
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:41,600
- It's incorrect. - Number two, cauldron?

1734
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:43,540
(Does "Caldera" mean "Cauldron" in Spanish?)

1735
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,270
It's incorrect. It can't be "Cauldron".

1736
00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:46,570
(Correct)

1737
00:57:46,577 --> 00:57:47,740
Is it correct?

1738
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:48,840
("Caldera" means "Cauldron" in Spanish.)

1739
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:51,110
- He is good these days. - That was incredible.

1740
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:55,110
Joy, please ask about us.

1741
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:56,220
- Kwang Soo. - Joy.

1742
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,750
Ask about us and you'll find out about your partner.

1743
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,585
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

1744
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:02,920
If we want to work this to our advantage,

1745
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:05,090
there is no need to check Seok Jin and Ji Hyo couple.

1746
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:07,725
In that case...

1747
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:09,190
(How about Jae Seok and So Min couple?)

1748
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,730
Gosh, is it Jae Seok?

1749
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:13,570
(Did they pick our pirate roulette because there is a thief?)

1750
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,500
I can't read Irene's face!

1751
00:58:15,505 --> 00:58:19,100
What is going on? What is she thinking?

1752
00:58:19,109 --> 00:58:20,470
It's hard to figure her out.

1753
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:22,275
(They pass over Se Chan and Irene couple.)

1754
00:58:22,646 --> 00:58:24,110
Hold on.

1755
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:25,110
(Which couple has two citizens?)

1756
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:27,580
What are you thinking?

1757
00:58:27,584 --> 00:58:29,720
Let's ask about Jong Kook's couple.

1758
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,850
Jong Kook's couple.

1759
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,850
With whom was Joy in the beginning?

1760
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:34,050
She was with Kwang Soo.

1761
00:58:34,057 --> 00:58:35,450
Kwang Soo?

1762
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:38,820
In Jong Kook and In A couple,

1763
00:58:38,829 --> 00:58:39,890
(Is there a thief...)

1764
00:58:39,896 --> 00:58:40,990
there is...

1765
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:44,295
(in Jong Kook and In A couple?)

1766
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:46,430
A thief.

1767
00:58:46,436 --> 00:58:48,400
(There is a thief!)

1768
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:49,400
Really?

1769
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:53,505
(How is there a thief in Jong Kook and In A couple?)

1770
00:58:53,677 --> 00:58:54,740
(You can't trust anyone in the world.)

1771
00:58:54,745 --> 00:58:57,640
You can insert three swords in a pirate roulette of your choice.

1772
00:58:57,648 --> 00:58:59,510
Which couple's pirate roulette will you choose?

1773
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:02,380
This is driving me crazy.

1774
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:05,385
(Staring)

1775
00:59:05,689 --> 00:59:07,190
- Kwang Soo. - Haha.

1776
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,720
- Insert the swords in ours. - How about this one?

1777
00:59:08,725 --> 00:59:10,990
- Look at Kwang Soo. - I am begging you.

1778
00:59:10,994 --> 00:59:13,890
Insert the swords into ours. We have a big pirate roulette.

1779
00:59:13,897 --> 00:59:14,960
- It won't pop out. - It's too big.

1780
00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:16,560
Do you really think it will pop out?

1781
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:18,965
The chance is 1 out of 23.

1782
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:20,600
What have I done wrong?

1783
00:59:20,604 --> 00:59:21,800
- Let's go with theirs. - Okay.

1784
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:22,830
(They pick the safest one.)

1785
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:25,035
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1786
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,070
Please, please.

1787
00:59:27,077 --> 00:59:30,040
It's the best one. It's the safest one.

1788
00:59:30,047 --> 00:59:31,210
If the pirate pops out, we switch partners.

1789
00:59:31,214 --> 00:59:32,940
That's right.

1790
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:36,845
(I really hope the pirate pops out so that I can get a new partner.)

1791
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:40,450
(Please pop out.)

1792
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:42,255
It didn't pop out.

1793
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:45,720
My goodness.

1794
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:47,560
(The second sword doesn't move the pirate either.)

1795
00:59:47,564 --> 00:59:48,790
It won't pop out.

1796
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:51,660
(22 slots and 1 sword remain.)

1797
00:59:51,668 --> 00:59:54,230
(Joy, I believe in you.)

1798
00:59:54,237 --> 00:59:57,140
(I want to be reunited with you.)

1799
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,905
I bet it will pop out.

1800
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:01,805
I bet it will pop out.

1801
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:04,210
Gosh, it didn't pop out.

1802
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:06,545
Kwang Soo wanted it to pop out.

1803
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:07,580
Seriously.

1804
01:00:07,584 --> 01:00:10,850
- Kwang Soo, you are safe with me. - He wants a different partner.

1805
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:13,150
The circumstances tell me you are a thief!

1806
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:14,350
(There is no doubt about it.)

1807
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:16,055
For goodness' sake.

1808
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,690
(Is Han Na a thief?)

1809
01:00:17,694 --> 01:00:18,920
- For goodness' sake. - For goodness' sake.

1810
01:00:18,929 --> 01:00:21,260
The next question comes with four knives.

1811
01:00:21,264 --> 01:00:23,500
- Okay. - They will make a pirate pop out...

1812
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,930
of a small one.

1813
01:00:24,935 --> 01:00:26,530
It's bound to happen.

1814
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:28,335
Come on!

1815
01:00:28,438 --> 01:00:30,040
It's bound to happen.

1816
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,270
Among the examples,

1817
01:00:31,274 --> 01:00:33,070
which one isn't a pure Korean word?

1818
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:34,240
Which one isn't a pure Korean word?

1819
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,775
Number one, you.

1820
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,010
Number two, wife.

1821
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:42,810
Number three, honey.

1822
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:44,350
Number four, darling.

1823
01:00:44,354 --> 01:00:46,250
I got it!

1824
01:00:46,256 --> 01:00:47,320
Okay.

1825
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:49,055
Number one, you.

1826
01:00:51,228 --> 01:00:53,090
- Number one, you. - It's correct.

1827
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,060
(Is "You" not a pure Korean word?)

1828
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:56,860
(It's correct.)

1829
01:00:56,867 --> 01:00:57,860
("You" uses Chinese characters.)

1830
01:00:57,868 --> 01:00:58,860
Yes!

1831
01:00:58,869 --> 01:01:00,430
- Does "You" use Chinese characters? - Yes.

1832
01:01:00,437 --> 01:01:02,500
It uses Chinese characters...

1833
01:01:02,506 --> 01:01:04,670
- for "Suitable" and "Body". - I didn't know.

1834
01:01:04,674 --> 01:01:06,170
Hold on. Han Na has no intention...

1835
01:01:06,176 --> 01:01:08,870
to get a question right.

1836
01:01:08,879 --> 01:01:10,940
Shouldn't you take a measure?

1837
01:01:10,947 --> 01:01:12,710
- That's ridiculous. - She doesn't do anything.

1838
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:14,510
"I see. Honey."

1839
01:01:14,518 --> 01:01:16,080
"Wife."

1840
01:01:16,086 --> 01:01:17,855
(She simply repeats after the examples.)

1841
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:20,390
(She turns on the parrot mode.)

1842
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:21,620
(Honey)

1843
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,820
(Darling)

1844
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,490
(She has zero interest in the question.)

1845
01:01:24,494 --> 01:01:26,320
(For goodness' sake.)

1846
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,160
She simply talks to herself.

1847
01:01:28,165 --> 01:01:30,560
It's fascinating.

1848
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,030
"Honey" is like an exclamation.

1849
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:33,130
Honey!

1850
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:35,330
"Honey" is like an exclamation.

1851
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,370
(Does she not answer the questions because she is a thief?)

1852
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:38,470
We should ask.

1853
01:01:38,475 --> 01:01:39,770
That's right.

1854
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:41,740
In Haha and Joy couple,

1855
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:43,440
- is there a thief? - Is there a thief?

1856
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:45,510
There is no thief.

1857
01:01:45,515 --> 01:01:47,445
I told you.

1858
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:49,480
(It's time to insert the swords.)

1859
01:01:49,486 --> 01:01:51,685
- Whose roulette will it be? - We will choose...

1860
01:01:51,988 --> 01:01:53,390
the one with the highest chance,

1861
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,520
- Haha and Joy's pirate roulette. - It's the best bet.

1862
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:57,490
The pirate will pop out for sure.

1863
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:59,930
If it doesn't, I must choose their roulette next.

1864
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,860
We will insert the swords. Please focus.

1865
01:02:01,865 --> 01:02:03,600
I will be really surprised if it doesn't pop out.

1866
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,630
I hope it pops out.

1867
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:06,765
(It's Seok Jin's chance to lose Ji Hyo, a thief.)

1868
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,200
(The first sword)

1869
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:11,135
It didn't pop out.

1870
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:13,070
Could it be that...

1871
01:02:13,076 --> 01:02:14,670
(Please pop out...)

1872
01:02:14,678 --> 01:02:16,840
(so that I can escape from Ji Hyo, a thief.)

1873
01:02:16,847 --> 01:02:18,745
It didn't pop out.

1874
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:21,980
Maybe it won't pop out.

1875
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:23,380
(The second sword doesn't do anything either.)

1876
01:02:23,386 --> 01:02:24,380
- This is unbelievable. - Hey!

1877
01:02:24,387 --> 01:02:26,450
- If it doesn't pop out... - If it doesn't pop out...

1878
01:02:26,456 --> 01:02:28,250
It needs to pop out. It has to pop out.

1879
01:02:28,258 --> 01:02:29,820
This is unbelievable.

1880
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:31,220
How many swords do you have left? 2? 4?

1881
01:02:31,228 --> 01:02:33,120
(In any case, Ji Hyo will be a citizen's partner...)

1882
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,995
(since both Seok Jin and Haha are citizens.)

1883
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:39,560
(The pirate pops out.)

1884
01:02:39,569 --> 01:02:41,000
- All right. - This is bad.

1885
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:43,600
- This is bad. - You did it.

1886
01:02:43,607 --> 01:02:46,100
I need a different partner.

1887
01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:48,640
I really need a different partner.

1888
01:02:48,645 --> 01:02:49,940
Either Haha...

1889
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:51,010
or Joy...

1890
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,940
is with a thief no matter what.

1891
01:02:52,949 --> 01:02:54,380
Perhaps both of them are thieves.

1892
01:02:54,384 --> 01:02:56,015
Joy.

1893
01:02:56,086 --> 01:02:57,220
You are a thief, right?

1894
01:02:57,220 --> 01:02:58,885
(Seok Jin is obsessed with attention.)

1895
01:02:58,955 --> 01:02:59,950
You are a thief, right?

1896
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,020
I am a citizen.

1897
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:02,020
You are lying.

1898
01:03:02,025 --> 01:03:04,020
(He confesses he is a citizen in the most suspicious way.)

1899
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:06,455
I know what you are because I asked.

1900
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:08,790
Are you a citizen?

1901
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:10,160
- Really? - Really.

1902
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,360
(Haha gets fooled by Ji Hyo's acting skills.)

1903
01:03:12,369 --> 01:03:14,100
Now,

1904
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:16,500
it's better to find a couple with two citizens.

1905
01:03:16,506 --> 01:03:17,770
- That's right. - That's right.

1906
01:03:17,774 --> 01:03:20,270
Then you can switch with that couple.

1907
01:03:20,277 --> 01:03:21,340
(In that case...)

1908
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:23,105
What?

1909
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:26,340
You can put yourself at ease!

1910
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:28,680
I am so scared and stressed out.

1911
01:03:28,685 --> 01:03:29,980
Why would you be stressed out?

1912
01:03:29,986 --> 01:03:32,780
Why do you think I am calm?

1913
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:34,620
- Why wouldn't you be calm? - I mean...

1914
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:36,020
(Kwang Soo is determined to get a different partner.)

1915
01:03:36,026 --> 01:03:37,320
I can't believe you.

1916
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,090
This question also comes...

1917
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:40,960
- with 4 swords. - 4 swords.

1918
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,360
A person has 12 pairs of ribs.

1919
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:45,760
What's the name of the 10th ribs?

1920
01:03:45,769 --> 01:03:47,070
I know this one!

1921
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:49,665
Number one, true ribs.

1922
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:51,170
- That sounds delicious. - Number two,

1923
01:03:51,174 --> 01:03:53,035
floating ribs.

1924
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:56,175
Number three, false ribs.

1925
01:03:56,246 --> 01:03:58,010
Number four, young ribs.

1926
01:03:58,014 --> 01:03:59,510
- I got it! - I got it!

1927
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:01,180
(They yell out at the same time.)

1928
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:02,780
Se Chan was faster.

1929
01:04:02,786 --> 01:04:04,150
Please give me a chance.

1930
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:07,090
- Se Chan was faster. - Please.

1931
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:08,420
Please give me a chance.

1932
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:10,520
They yelled out at the same time.

1933
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:11,690
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Yes.

1934
01:04:11,695 --> 01:04:12,890
Rock-paper-scissors.

1935
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:14,360
(They play rock-paper-scissors and Kwang Soo wins.)

1936
01:04:14,364 --> 01:04:15,890
- Okay! - You know,

1937
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:18,430
- Han Na didn't move an inch. - Come on out.

1938
01:04:18,435 --> 01:04:20,130
We need to answer the question.

1939
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:21,200
Han Na is disinterested.

1940
01:04:21,204 --> 01:04:23,100
She likes things as they are.

1941
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:25,000
- Which answer do you have in mind? - What's the answer?

1942
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:26,870
Number three, false ribs.

1943
01:04:26,876 --> 01:04:28,570
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1944
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:30,575
Number four, young ribs.

1945
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:34,010
Number four, young ribs.

1946
01:04:34,017 --> 01:04:35,710
Number three... No.

1947
01:04:35,719 --> 01:04:37,415
Number three.

1948
01:04:38,254 --> 01:04:39,350
What is wrong with you?

1949
01:04:39,356 --> 01:04:40,450
(My pick was number three.)

1950
01:04:40,457 --> 01:04:42,320
- I think... - What is wrong with you?

1951
01:04:42,325 --> 01:04:44,590
- Those are the 10th ribs. - There are other citizens.

1952
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,190
There are other citizens too!

1953
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,490
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1954
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:48,760
There are citizens other than me!

1955
01:04:48,765 --> 01:04:50,830
Han Na is good.

1956
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:51,830
- I mean... - Listen.

1957
01:04:51,835 --> 01:04:55,100
- I want to be with you. - Why?

1958
01:04:55,105 --> 01:04:57,200
You don't say a word to me. So why?

1959
01:04:57,207 --> 01:04:59,070
It's not like you ask me a question.

1960
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:01,005
- Kwang Soo. - My goodness.

1961
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,110
(It wakes him up.)

1962
01:05:04,114 --> 01:05:05,210
In the end,

1963
01:05:05,215 --> 01:05:07,110
- good days will come. - That's right.

1964
01:05:07,117 --> 01:05:08,210
I got it!

1965
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,050
- She said it first. - In A.

1966
01:05:11,054 --> 01:05:15,555
Number three, gasm ribs?

1967
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:17,420
I got it!

1968
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:19,720
The answer is false ribs!

1969
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:21,660
He needs to get hit.

1970
01:05:21,665 --> 01:05:23,495
Jae Seok, you need to hit Jong Kook.

1971
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,360
- Why? - Will Jae Seok hit me?

1972
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:26,995
(Do I get to hit Jong Kook?)

1973
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,200
- Stay where you are. - Why?

1974
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:31,170
- I was on my way to hit you. - I like meeting people halfway.

1975
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:34,040
(The hitter is more nervous.)

1976
01:05:34,044 --> 01:05:36,370
- Oh, is that so? - Okay.

1977
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,010
Running Man will continue to air.

1978
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:39,210
(He makes it clear.)

1979
01:05:39,215 --> 01:05:40,680
Go ahead and hit me.

1980
01:05:40,684 --> 01:05:41,980
Would you sit down?

1981
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:43,780
Why? I like to get hit standing up.

1982
01:05:43,787 --> 01:05:45,685
(He refuses to sit down.)

1983
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:48,050
Since he doesn't want to sit down, you can stand on a chair.

1984
01:05:48,058 --> 01:05:49,220
- Okay. - Fine.

1985
01:05:49,225 --> 01:05:51,490
(Seok Jin gets him a chair.)

1986
01:05:51,494 --> 01:05:52,890
- Okay. - Fine.

1987
01:05:52,896 --> 01:05:54,660
- Stand on a chair. Okay. - Okay.

1988
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:55,760
- Okay. - Okay.

1989
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:56,760
- Is this okay? - It's good.

1990
01:05:56,766 --> 01:05:58,765
- Okay. - Okay.

1991
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:00,830
(Smacking)

1992
01:06:00,837 --> 01:06:01,800
Okay.

1993
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:03,330
(Jong Kook is annoyed.)

1994
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:05,105
Okay.

1995
01:06:06,209 --> 01:06:07,270
Okay.

1996
01:06:07,277 --> 01:06:10,480
(He explodes with anger.)

1997
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,840
Don't be angry.

1998
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:13,010
- Don't be angry. - Okay.

1999
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:14,745
(Jae Seok hit a sleeping tiger.)

2000
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:15,880
Shout out, "I got it."

2001
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:17,020
I got it!

2002
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,685
- I got it! - I got it!

2003
01:06:19,355 --> 01:06:21,485
Number three, false ribs.

2004
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,350
Number three, false ribs.

2005
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,825
F, A, L, S, E.

2006
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:28,295
Ribs. Number three.

2007
01:06:28,364 --> 01:06:30,730
- Yes! - We had the correct answer.

2008
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:32,430
My goodness.

2009
01:06:32,435 --> 01:06:34,465
Which couple should we ask about?

2010
01:06:34,504 --> 01:06:36,740
Kwang Soo, why don't we ask...

2011
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,700
about Jong Kook's couple?

2012
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:40,370
Let's ask about Jae Seok's couple.

2013
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,570
But So Min is...

2014
01:06:42,579 --> 01:06:44,710
You are having a long discussion with Han Na.

2015
01:06:44,714 --> 01:06:46,510
There is a couple I want to ask about,

2016
01:06:46,516 --> 01:06:48,210
but she is insistent.

2017
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:50,880
Let Han Na pick the question.

2018
01:06:50,887 --> 01:06:53,150
I will let you pick the question.

2019
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:55,120
I will let you insert the swords as you please.

2020
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:58,890
- Okay. - Pick a couple you are sure about.

2021
01:06:58,895 --> 01:07:01,990
In Jong Kook and In A couple, is there a thief?

2022
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:04,730
In Jong Kook and In A couple,

2023
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:06,330
there is a thief.

2024
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:07,630
Really?

2025
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:09,030
(The unexpected answer throws them off.)

2026
01:07:09,038 --> 01:07:10,140
Really?

2027
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:11,570
- What is it? - What is it?

2028
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,100
What happened?

2029
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:14,740
It could have been disastrous.

2030
01:07:14,744 --> 01:07:15,940
(Thank goodness.)

2031
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:17,540
- What? - I thought they were citizens.

2032
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:19,010
Don't talk to me.

2033
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:21,710
(She sticks out her tongue.)

2034
01:07:21,718 --> 01:07:23,715
What?

2035
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:25,250
Hold on.

2036
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:27,320
She stuck out her tongue at me.

2037
01:07:27,323 --> 01:07:28,420
Why?

2038
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:29,720
- Why? - When did she do that?

2039
01:07:29,726 --> 01:07:31,090
He told me not to talk to him.

2040
01:07:31,094 --> 01:07:32,520
(That's why she stuck out her tongue.)

2041
01:07:32,529 --> 01:07:34,360
- I communicated with my tongue. - That's right.

2042
01:07:34,364 --> 01:07:35,860
Han Na is right.

2043
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:38,030
I understand her.

2044
01:07:38,034 --> 01:07:39,660
- She stuck out her tongue. - Then...

2045
01:07:39,669 --> 01:07:41,000
Insert the swords where you want.

2046
01:07:41,004 --> 01:07:42,130
Make the choices...

2047
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:43,800
and pave your own path.

2048
01:07:43,807 --> 01:07:45,670
(I will let you go.)

2049
01:07:45,675 --> 01:07:47,470
I still don't think you should change your partner.

2050
01:07:47,477 --> 01:07:49,970
(She is still a bit obsessive.)

2051
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:53,240
(What does she want me to do?)

2052
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:54,980
How frustrating.

2053
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:56,480
(He must be confused.)

2054
01:07:56,486 --> 01:08:00,585
I think you should go with a big pirate roulette.

2055
01:08:00,757 --> 01:08:02,785
You must think I am an utter fool.

2056
01:08:02,959 --> 01:08:04,220
It's not like that.

2057
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:06,090
It would be better for your future...

2058
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:09,260
to avoid changing your partner.

2059
01:08:09,265 --> 01:08:11,830
Seok Jin and Joy.

2060
01:08:11,835 --> 01:08:13,930
Why did you pick us?

2061
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:15,630
- Kwang Soo. - Why did you pick us?

2062
01:08:15,638 --> 01:08:16,700
What did you ask?

2063
01:08:16,706 --> 01:08:19,370
It's just that I know Joy is a citizen.

2064
01:08:19,375 --> 01:08:21,640
He knows Joy is a citizen.

2065
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:24,410
(Kwang Soo makes a wise decision to be reunited with Joy.)

2066
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:26,540
It won't be an easy task since you have four swords.

2067
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:28,180
(There are 8 slots and 4 swords.)

2068
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:30,080
(50 percent is a good chance.)

2069
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:31,850
Hurry up and do it.

2070
01:08:31,855 --> 01:08:33,950
(I must become a couple with Joy once more.)

2071
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:36,655
- I am confident. - It won't pop out.

2072
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:38,690
It doesn't pop out in this kind of a situation.

2073
01:08:38,695 --> 01:08:39,790
I know.

2074
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:42,190
- That's what makes him unlucky. - Come on.

2075
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:43,860
Joy is desperate, too.

2076
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,130
(Pop out.)

2077
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:46,965
It will pop out.

2078
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,435
I am sure it will pop out.

2079
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:51,270
(The second sword is a failure.)

2080
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:52,600
- You inserted it. - It doesn't pop out...

2081
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:54,070
in a situation like this one.

2082
01:08:54,077 --> 01:08:55,970
If it doesn't pop out, it will be like a festival.

2083
01:08:55,979 --> 01:08:57,410
Seriously. I will dance right away.

2084
01:08:57,413 --> 01:08:59,240
I will throw Kwang Soo in the air to celebrate.

2085
01:08:59,249 --> 01:09:00,710
(The third sword is a failure.)

2086
01:09:00,717 --> 01:09:02,780
Didn't you say you are confident?

2087
01:09:02,785 --> 01:09:04,580
Kwang Soo must be nervous.

2088
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:06,890
Get ready to throw Kwang Soo in the air.

2089
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:08,250
Get ready. Get ready.

2090
01:09:08,258 --> 01:09:10,520
- Get ready. - Look at Han Na.

2091
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,190
(She is ready to throw him in the air.)

2092
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,490
Han Na, get ready.

2093
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,060
- Okay. - I am ready.

2094
01:09:15,064 --> 01:09:16,490
- Get ready. - Kwang Soo, I am ready.

2095
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:17,860
Let's throw Kwang Soo in the air.

2096
01:09:17,867 --> 01:09:19,665
This is the last sword.

2097
01:09:19,736 --> 01:09:21,330
It will be amazing.

2098
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:22,700
(5 slots and 1 sword remain.)

2099
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:24,435
No.

2100
01:09:25,475 --> 01:09:27,940
(Will Kwang Soo get thrown in the air?)

2101
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:30,605
(Will the pirate pop out?)

2102
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:35,080
(The pirate remains the same.)

2103
01:09:35,084 --> 01:09:37,515
(The couples remain the same.)

2104
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:40,390
In 1, 2, 3.

2105
01:09:40,390 --> 01:09:42,585
(It's a festival for everyone but Kwang Soo.)

2106
01:09:43,026 --> 01:09:44,390
All right.

2107
01:09:44,394 --> 01:09:45,590
That was great.

2108
01:09:45,595 --> 01:09:47,760
- That was great. - All right.

2109
01:09:47,764 --> 01:09:50,160
Cheer up. This is good for your future.

2110
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:51,430
(Kwang Soo lost a 50-percent chance.)

2111
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:52,760
Get up now. Don't be like this.

2112
01:09:52,769 --> 01:09:55,035
It's so interesting. How could he fail?

2113
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:57,000
- You can win five knives. - Let's do this.

2114
01:09:57,006 --> 01:09:58,400
You can win five knives.

2115
01:09:58,408 --> 01:09:59,670
(You can win 5 knives by solving this question.)

2116
01:09:59,676 --> 01:10:01,040
Let's do this.

2117
01:10:01,044 --> 01:10:02,170
(We have to get it right.)

2118
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:04,040
- It's a short-answer question. - A short-answer question?

2119
01:10:04,047 --> 01:10:06,110
Okay. It might actually be better.

2120
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:07,310
Here we go.

2121
01:10:07,317 --> 01:10:09,780
What does this newly-coined word mean?

2122
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:12,350
I know many new words.

2123
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:14,520
Se Chan and Haha are good at these things.

2124
01:10:14,524 --> 01:10:16,050
(We know many new words.)

2125
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:18,755
Let's do this. Let's get it.

2126
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:20,190
"Jamanchu".

2127
01:10:20,196 --> 01:10:21,760
(Jamanchu)

2128
01:10:21,764 --> 01:10:22,890
What?

2129
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:26,630
(What does the newly-coined word, "jamanchu", mean?)

2130
01:10:26,636 --> 01:10:27,630
(I've never heard it before.)

2131
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:29,600
"Jamanchu".

2132
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,000
Let me answer!

2133
01:10:31,007 --> 01:10:36,740
(So Min seems confident. Will she get it right?)

2134
01:10:36,746 --> 01:10:38,410
"Confident but ugly man".

2135
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:41,145
(Confident but ugly man)

2136
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:42,910
Come here.

2137
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:45,550
(So Min comes up with a meaning based on the people around her.)

2138
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:49,020
(When you say the wrong answer, you get hit with a hammer.)

2139
01:10:49,025 --> 01:10:50,920
- Jamanchu? - Jamanchu?

2140
01:10:50,927 --> 01:10:52,590
- I think I've heard it somewhere. - Jamanchu.

2141
01:10:52,595 --> 01:10:54,490
Let me answer!

2142
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:56,960
(Will Jong Kook say the correct answer?)

2143
01:10:56,966 --> 01:11:00,730
"A memory that only you cherish"?

2144
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:02,400
Memory?

2145
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:06,170
(It sounds so old.)

2146
01:11:06,175 --> 01:11:07,470
Is it correct?

2147
01:11:07,477 --> 01:11:09,905
No?

2148
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:11,810
- Hold on. - Hit me.

2149
01:11:11,814 --> 01:11:13,710
(When you say the wrong answer, you get hit.)

2150
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:14,910
Hit me.

2151
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:17,580
- Hit me right now. - What are you doing?

2152
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:19,080
(Jae Seok steps backwards.)

2153
01:11:19,088 --> 01:11:20,250
- What are you doing? - Let's get it over with.

2154
01:11:20,256 --> 01:11:21,920
- Get me a stool. - What stool?

2155
01:11:21,924 --> 01:11:23,420
Get me a stool.

2156
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:25,790
(Here you go.)

2157
01:11:25,795 --> 01:11:26,990
Gosh. Get me a stool.

2158
01:11:26,996 --> 01:11:28,360
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok work well together.)

2159
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:29,960
- Gosh. - Why do you never trust me?

2160
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:31,860
- Thank you. - No problem.

2161
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:34,665
- I thought you'd like this angle. - Look to the front.

2162
01:11:34,704 --> 01:11:36,300
(Fine. Hit me once.)

2163
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:38,900
(Twice)

2164
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,410
- Hold on. - I'm sorry.

2165
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:43,375
(Why did you hit me twice?)

2166
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:45,310
- You hit me twice. - Hold on.

2167
01:11:45,314 --> 01:11:48,180
(I didn't mean to.)

2168
01:11:48,184 --> 01:11:50,380
- Why did you hit me twice? - I was going to hit you once.

2169
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,380
- Exactly. - I'm sorry.

2170
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:55,185
- Let go of me. - I was so annoyed.

2171
01:11:55,525 --> 01:11:56,720
Let go of me.

2172
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,790
- I was so annoyed. - Stay still.

2173
01:11:58,795 --> 01:12:00,855
(Jong Kook gets back at Jae Seok.)

2174
01:12:01,264 --> 01:12:02,490
(After hitting Jong Kook lightly twice,)

2175
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,590
(Jae Seok gets hit hard once.)

2176
01:12:03,599 --> 01:12:05,530
Let me answer!

2177
01:12:05,535 --> 01:12:07,130
It's too hard.

2178
01:12:07,136 --> 01:12:08,800
It's really hard.

2179
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:10,500
Let me give you a hint.

2180
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,570
It is related to dating.

2181
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:16,140
Also, people who have always been single often say this.

2182
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:17,240
Jamanchu.

2183
01:12:17,246 --> 01:12:18,540
People who have always been single?

2184
01:12:18,548 --> 01:12:19,810
(People who have always been single often say this.)

2185
01:12:19,816 --> 01:12:22,280
- People who have been single... - Jamanchu.

2186
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:24,515
When was your last relationship?

2187
01:12:24,587 --> 01:12:26,250
(You must understand singles well.)

2188
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:28,420
- Do you have any idea? - Why do you suddenly...

2189
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:30,520
You're so cruel.

2190
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:32,320
Do I have any idea?

2191
01:12:32,328 --> 01:12:34,225
You...

2192
01:12:36,065 --> 01:12:37,735
Let me answer!

2193
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:39,060
(It's related to dating.)

2194
01:12:39,068 --> 01:12:41,500
(Does he remember it now?)

2195
01:12:41,504 --> 01:12:44,300
(What will this dating expert say?)

2196
01:12:44,307 --> 01:12:46,200
I think you say it when you order more food.

2197
01:12:46,209 --> 01:12:48,140
- When you order more food? - When you order more food?

2198
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:51,340
When you order more food?

2199
01:12:51,347 --> 01:12:52,440
- When you order more food? - "Jjajangmyeon..."

2200
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:55,880
"10 dollars' worth of jjajangmyeon, please."

2201
01:12:55,885 --> 01:12:57,780
"Jjajangmyeon and dumplings, please."

2202
01:12:57,787 --> 01:13:01,150
(That must be it.)

2203
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,550
"Jjajangmyeon and dumplings, please." Isn't it correct?

2204
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:04,820
(Do they date at Chinese restaurants these days?)

2205
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:07,790
"Jjajangmyeon and dumplings, please."

2206
01:13:07,797 --> 01:13:08,960
It's taking too long.

2207
01:13:08,965 --> 01:13:10,060
As it's a bit hard,

2208
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:12,760
- we'll give you a crucial hint. - Okay.

2209
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,630
- It's very crucial. - Good.

2210
01:13:14,637 --> 01:13:17,140
It'd be the opposite of a blind date.

2211
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:19,405
(It's a crucial hint.)

2212
01:13:19,775 --> 01:13:21,770
- Let me answer! - Let me answer!

2213
01:13:21,777 --> 01:13:23,440
(We're sure this time!)

2214
01:13:23,446 --> 01:13:25,310
Isn't it "casual relationship preferred"?

2215
01:13:25,314 --> 01:13:26,440
Oh, my.

2216
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,880
(Jong Kook sounds confident. Is it correct?)

2217
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:30,980
- "Casual relationship preferred". - "Casual relationship preferred".

2218
01:13:30,987 --> 01:13:32,150
- It must be correct. - It must be correct.

2219
01:13:32,155 --> 01:13:35,920
(Jong Kook and In A's answer is correct.)

2220
01:13:35,925 --> 01:13:37,920
- Right? - The opposite of a blind date...

2221
01:13:37,927 --> 01:13:39,120
That's right.

2222
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:41,760
"Casual relationship preferred". That makes sense.

2223
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:42,960
It was correct.

2224
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,730
That's why I asked you.

2225
01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:47,700
This is why you still don't have a girlfriend.

2226
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:49,435
Hey.

2227
01:13:49,539 --> 01:13:53,270
(It's what everyone has wanted to point out.)

2228
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:54,740
Did you hear what she said?

2229
01:13:54,744 --> 01:13:56,540
"When was your last relationship?"

2230
01:13:56,546 --> 01:13:58,340
She asked me if I knew the answer.

2231
01:13:58,347 --> 01:13:59,840
Because it was about singles.

2232
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:01,810
(Stop preferring casual relationships now.)

2233
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:03,980
- Those two? - Jae Seok and So Min.

2234
01:14:03,986 --> 01:14:05,250
Okay.

2235
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:06,250
(Jong Kook and In A choose Jae Seok and So Min.)

2236
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:07,620
- Ask them. - Okay.

2237
01:14:07,623 --> 01:14:09,455
(Jae Seok gulps.)

2238
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,720
We want to know about Jae Seok's team.

2239
01:14:11,727 --> 01:14:12,790
(Are Jae Seok and So Min both citizens?)

2240
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:16,025
(Or is either of them a thief?)

2241
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:19,360
There is one or more thieves...

2242
01:14:19,368 --> 01:14:20,930
in Jae Seok and So Min's team.

2243
01:14:20,937 --> 01:14:23,235
(There is one or more thieves.)

2244
01:14:23,739 --> 01:14:25,770
Too bad. Hold on.

2245
01:14:25,775 --> 01:14:28,040
(There is one or more thieves?)

2246
01:14:28,044 --> 01:14:29,540
(It's unexpected.)

2247
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:30,840
Hold on. Let me think.

2248
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,675
(They start to think hard.)

2249
01:14:32,815 --> 01:14:34,980
(Which team should we switch partners with?)

2250
01:14:34,984 --> 01:14:37,950
Strategically, we have to switch with citizens.

2251
01:14:37,954 --> 01:14:39,750
A team where both are citizens.

2252
01:14:39,755 --> 01:14:41,050
Exactly. Definitely.

2253
01:14:41,057 --> 01:14:42,520
(Regardless of your own identities,)

2254
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:44,590
(it's safe to choose Seok Jin and Joy because they're citizens.)

2255
01:14:44,594 --> 01:14:46,090
- Okay. - Okay.

2256
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:47,725
We choose...

2257
01:14:49,165 --> 01:14:50,760
Seok Jin and Joy.

2258
01:14:50,766 --> 01:14:51,930
(Jong Kook and In A choose Seok Jin and Joy.)

2259
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:53,160
Do we look that easy?

2260
01:14:53,169 --> 01:14:54,630
Why?

2261
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:56,100
The pirate will definitely pop out this time.

2262
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:57,400
- It will. - It will.

2263
01:14:57,406 --> 01:14:58,470
Three knives are already in.

2264
01:14:58,474 --> 01:14:59,600
Okay.

2265
01:14:59,609 --> 01:15:01,040
- It will pop out. - We have to...

2266
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,340
switch partners.

2267
01:15:02,345 --> 01:15:03,540
There you go.

2268
01:15:03,546 --> 01:15:05,310
- One. - It'll definitely pop out.

2269
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:06,940
- It will pop out. - Two.

2270
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:09,445
If it doesn't, that'd be strange.

2271
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:10,650
In A.

2272
01:15:10,653 --> 01:15:11,950
It hasn't popped out yet.

2273
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:13,050
(It's not popping out.)

2274
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:14,450
(Despite the high chance, it still hasn't popped out.)

2275
01:15:14,457 --> 01:15:15,820
I can't believe it.

2276
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:18,120
Why isn't it popping out?

2277
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,490
There you go.

2278
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:20,490
It has popped out.

2279
01:15:20,496 --> 01:15:22,295
Switch partners.

2280
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:24,360
(Seok Jin and In A become partners.)

2281
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:25,660
Gosh.

2282
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:28,465
(Jong Kook and Joy become partners.)

2283
01:15:29,105 --> 01:15:30,230
Okay.

2284
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,900
(Jae Seok and So Min win 7 knives.)

2285
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,370
How did you know?

2286
01:15:33,376 --> 01:15:35,240
I knew the answer.

2287
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:37,310
Let's ask about Jong Kook's team.

2288
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:38,510
Jong Kook?

2289
01:15:38,514 --> 01:15:41,010
Jong Kook and Joy.

2290
01:15:41,017 --> 01:15:43,680
There is one or more thieves...

2291
01:15:43,686 --> 01:15:45,350
in Jong Kook and Joy's team.

2292
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,150
(There is one or more thieves.)

2293
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:48,785
We were right.

2294
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:52,690
(There is a thief in Jong Kook and Joy's team?)

2295
01:15:52,695 --> 01:15:53,790
Gosh, I'm so surprised.

2296
01:15:53,796 --> 01:15:55,460
I'm so surprised.

2297
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:56,760
Gosh.

2298
01:15:56,766 --> 01:16:01,935
(As Joy is a citizen, it must mean...)

2299
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:06,600
(Jong Kook is the first male thief.)

2300
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:08,840
(After deciding partners, thieves were decided.)

2301
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:10,775
I'm in trouble.

2302
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:15,045
(I'm a thief?)

2303
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:16,710
I'm so surprised.

2304
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,080
Really?

2305
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:21,050
Han Na or In A...

2306
01:16:21,057 --> 01:16:22,050
(Which team should we choose?)

2307
01:16:22,058 --> 01:16:23,920
But we know Han Na's identity.

2308
01:16:23,926 --> 01:16:25,390
Then...

2309
01:16:25,394 --> 01:16:27,290
- Irene and Se Chan... - It might be...

2310
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:28,690
It might be better.

2311
01:16:28,698 --> 01:16:30,060
Irene and Se Chan.

2312
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:31,530
We choose Irene and Se Chan.

2313
01:16:31,534 --> 01:16:33,830
(They switch partners with Se Chan and Irene.)

2314
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,600
- Okay. - Every team is dangerous.

2315
01:16:35,604 --> 01:16:38,470
- Every team is dangerous. - It gave me goosebumps.

2316
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:39,800
We're so surprised.

2317
01:16:39,809 --> 01:16:41,440
- We can't tell you who it is. - It's so unexpected.

2318
01:16:41,444 --> 01:16:42,540
Which team are you choosing?

2319
01:16:42,545 --> 01:16:43,770
- You guys. - Us?

2320
01:16:43,779 --> 01:16:44,810
Yes.

2321
01:16:44,814 --> 01:16:47,310
We want to be safe.

2322
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:49,080
I'm so surprised.

2323
01:16:49,085 --> 01:16:50,510
(They have 7 knives, and there are 16 slots.)

2324
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:52,215
Gosh.

2325
01:16:53,656 --> 01:16:55,120
They have seven knives.

2326
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:56,320
We have seven knives.

2327
01:16:56,325 --> 01:16:57,720
The chance is high then.

2328
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,090
(It's almost a 50-percent chance. It has to pop out.)

2329
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:01,295
- I'm so surprised. - We're doomed.

2330
01:17:01,497 --> 01:17:03,760
(They succeed after 4 tries.)

2331
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:05,030
- It has popped out. - It has popped out.

2332
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:06,830
- So we're changing partners. - It's okay, right?

2333
01:17:06,836 --> 01:17:08,500
- Are we switching partners? - Yes.

2334
01:17:08,504 --> 01:17:10,600
(They seem a little suspicious too.)

2335
01:17:10,606 --> 01:17:11,970
Me and Irene...

2336
01:17:11,974 --> 01:17:12,970
Are you switching partners?

2337
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:14,440
(Jong Kook asked about Jae Seok and So Min's identities.)

2338
01:17:14,443 --> 01:17:15,540
I'm starting to see it.

2339
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:17,940
It's driving me crazy.

2340
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,110
Gosh.

2341
01:17:19,115 --> 01:17:21,810
(They don't know each other's identity.)

2342
01:17:21,817 --> 01:17:22,980
I was so surprised.

2343
01:17:22,985 --> 01:17:24,815
(They feel unsure.)

2344
01:17:24,887 --> 01:17:26,650
What happened?

2345
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,020
You're a thief, right?

2346
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,050
Tell me.

2347
01:17:29,058 --> 01:17:31,220
I can't tell you until you tell me.

2348
01:17:31,227 --> 01:17:33,490
- Are you a thief? - No.

2349
01:17:33,496 --> 01:17:35,360
But Jong Kook is.

2350
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:36,490
Really?

2351
01:17:36,499 --> 01:17:39,430
That's right.

2352
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:41,465
Here's the last question.

2353
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:44,270
- You can win seven knives. - Okay.

2354
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,570
Seven.

2355
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:46,670
(You can win 7 knives by solving this difficult question.)

2356
01:17:46,675 --> 01:17:48,605
It's an English question.

2357
01:17:49,245 --> 01:17:50,810
- English? - Gosh.

2358
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:53,980
(We're allergic to English.)

2359
01:17:53,983 --> 01:17:56,015
Please.

2360
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:58,380
(I feel confident.)

2361
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:01,820
Which word should go in the blank?

2362
01:18:01,824 --> 01:18:05,390
You are the "blank" of my eye.

2363
01:18:05,394 --> 01:18:06,490
Okay. Let me answer.

2364
01:18:06,495 --> 01:18:08,160
- There are options. - There are?

2365
01:18:08,164 --> 01:18:09,890
He should get hit, though.

2366
01:18:09,899 --> 01:18:10,930
(Jong Kook is wrong.)

2367
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:12,430
- What? - He should.

2368
01:18:12,435 --> 01:18:13,530
I mean...

2369
01:18:13,536 --> 01:18:14,800
Come here.

2370
01:18:14,804 --> 01:18:16,300
(Fine. Hit me.)

2371
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:17,770
- Hit me. - Hold on.

2372
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:18,770
(It's happened before.)

2373
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,300
Hold on.

2374
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:21,740
Give me a second.

2375
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:24,005
- Hit me. - Hey.

2376
01:18:24,747 --> 01:18:26,010
Hit me.

2377
01:18:26,015 --> 01:18:27,310
There's a stool.

2378
01:18:27,316 --> 01:18:29,010
- I made a mistake last time. - Okay.

2379
01:18:29,018 --> 01:18:30,510
- I'll hit you just once this time. - Okay.

2380
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:32,685
- I got too worked up earlier. - Okay.

2381
01:18:34,056 --> 01:18:35,720
(Jae Seok jumps before hitting.)

2382
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:37,290
Is jumping allowed?

2383
01:18:37,293 --> 01:18:38,390
Okay.

2384
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:40,120
- Okay. - Okay.

2385
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:41,290
(Okay. I'll see you later.)

2386
01:18:41,297 --> 01:18:42,690
Let me answer.

2387
01:18:42,698 --> 01:18:44,360
Number four, "tear".

2388
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:47,900
(Kwang Soo always says whatever word he knows.)

2389
01:18:47,903 --> 01:18:49,730
Come here.

2390
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:52,470
Apparently, jumping is allowed.

2391
01:18:52,475 --> 01:18:54,540
But I have nothing to do with Jae Seok.

2392
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:55,770
Jumping is allowed.

2393
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:56,840
- I mean... - They say jumping is allowed.

2394
01:18:56,846 --> 01:18:58,240
I didn't do anything wrong.

2395
01:18:58,247 --> 01:19:00,040
They say jumping is allowed.

2396
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:01,980
It's allowed.

2397
01:19:01,984 --> 01:19:03,410
- Jumping is allowed. - I didn't...

2398
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,550
- I didn't do anything wrong. - Don't worry.

2399
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:08,350
I have to jump anyway because you're too tall.

2400
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:10,655
(Jumping)

2401
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:15,595
(Let's jump together.)

2402
01:19:16,398 --> 01:19:17,530
Hold on.

2403
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:18,760
You said jumping is allowed.

2404
01:19:18,767 --> 01:19:20,830
- You said jumping is allowed. - But you can't.

2405
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:22,730
- Why not? - You can't jump.

2406
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:24,300
"Why not?"

2407
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:25,600
- You can't. - Why can't I jump?

2408
01:19:25,608 --> 01:19:26,900
Sit down.

2409
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:28,540
1, 2, 3.

2410
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:31,740
(Jong Kook punishes Kwang Soo for cheating.)

2411
01:19:31,747 --> 01:19:33,310
(Kwang Soo's neck is pressed down.)

2412
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:34,380
Okay.

2413
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:35,580
(His neck is straightened.)

2414
01:19:35,584 --> 01:19:37,210
(They never leave his neck alone.)

2415
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:38,985
Thank you.

2416
01:19:39,388 --> 01:19:42,320
Number one, "apple".

2417
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:44,520
Number two, "peach".

2418
01:19:44,527 --> 01:19:46,590
Number three, "pear".

2419
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:48,760
Number four, "melon".

2420
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:49,760
Number...

2421
01:19:49,765 --> 01:19:51,560
- I know. - I know.

2422
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,130
I know.

2423
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:54,900
Number four, "melon".

2424
01:19:54,904 --> 01:19:55,900
(Wrong)

2425
01:19:55,905 --> 01:19:58,670
- I know. - I know.

2426
01:19:58,674 --> 01:19:59,870
- I raised my arm first. - I know!

2427
01:19:59,875 --> 01:20:02,570
(Among the tiger moths, Kwang Soo is the most passionate.)

2428
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:03,570
(Determined)

2429
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:06,510
I know. I know.

2430
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:07,980
I know.

2431
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:09,710
(He clenches his teeth.)

2432
01:20:09,718 --> 01:20:11,150
I said, I know.

2433
01:20:11,153 --> 01:20:13,050
I raised my hand first.

2434
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,250
Let me. Let me.

2435
01:20:15,257 --> 01:20:17,155
- Let me. - Okay.

2436
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:19,655
Number one, "apple".

2437
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:21,760
(He must get this right...)

2438
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:25,660
(in order to run away from Han Na.)

2439
01:20:25,668 --> 01:20:29,300
(Will his answer be able to save him?)

2440
01:20:29,305 --> 01:20:30,430
Yes!

2441
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:33,670
(I got it right!)

2442
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:37,775
(Goodbye, Han Na.)

2443
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:42,380
This time, you can choose the couple.

2444
01:20:42,384 --> 01:20:43,410
I'll stick it...

2445
01:20:43,419 --> 01:20:44,780
- wherever I want. - Why are you suddenly...

2446
01:20:44,787 --> 01:20:45,850
- talking to me? - Then...

2447
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:47,820
Why are you doing this after being so quiet?

2448
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:49,150
I mean...

2449
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:50,890
(What is her identity?)

2450
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,620
Han Na.

2451
01:20:52,628 --> 01:20:54,390
You can ask the question.

2452
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:55,660
- And you'll stick the sword? - Yes.

2453
01:20:55,664 --> 01:20:56,690
Okay.

2454
01:20:56,699 --> 01:20:58,595
(Kwang Soo will ask, and Han Na will stick the sword in.)

2455
01:20:59,635 --> 01:21:03,030
(A couple has Kwang Soo's attention.)

2456
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:07,770
(He is curious about Se Chan's team.)

2457
01:21:07,776 --> 01:21:09,640
Se Chan and So Min.

2458
01:21:09,645 --> 01:21:12,210
(If neither one of them is a thief,)

2459
01:21:12,214 --> 01:21:16,080
(he plans to switch teams with one of them.)

2460
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:19,650
In Se Chan's team, there is...

2461
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:24,620
(Is there a thief?)

2462
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:27,220
- Okay. - Okay.

2463
01:21:27,229 --> 01:21:33,765
(Is either Se Chan or So Min a thief?)

2464
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,170
(It's time to stick the swords in.)

2465
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,540
If Han Na sticks the swords in but it doesn't work,

2466
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:43,940
Han Na and Kwang Soo will...

2467
01:21:43,946 --> 01:21:47,110
(By the way)

2468
01:21:47,116 --> 01:21:49,480
Whom do you think I'll stab?

2469
01:21:49,485 --> 01:21:52,350
(She is scary.)

2470
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:54,450
- Hold on. - Whom will it be?

2471
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:56,520
(I will follow what the barrel man wants.)

2472
01:21:56,525 --> 01:21:59,120
Hold on, hold on. Why would you stick it in there?

2473
01:21:59,128 --> 01:22:00,925
(He is flustered.)

2474
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:03,190
(She sticks it in Haha and Ji Hyo's team where there is a thief.)

2475
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:04,560
- She did it. - It's all done.

2476
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,230
- That's it. - It's over.

2477
01:22:06,235 --> 01:22:07,430
Why would you put it in there?

2478
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:08,500
Great.

2479
01:22:08,504 --> 01:22:11,035
- Why? - It needs to pop out.

2480
01:22:11,607 --> 01:22:16,140
Kwang Soo! Hurry! You need to stop her.

2481
01:22:16,145 --> 01:22:19,710
It popped out!

2482
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:22,515
I asked about Se Chan and So Min, so why would you do this?

2483
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:26,250
Is Haha stupid? Why is he happy when Han Na is a thief?

2484
01:22:26,255 --> 01:22:28,285
Han Na is a thief.

2485
01:22:28,824 --> 01:22:29,820
(What is this situation?)

2486
01:22:29,825 --> 01:22:30,890
This is awesome.

2487
01:22:30,893 --> 01:22:31,920
(What is this situation?)

2488
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:33,290
Maybe they're not it.

2489
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:34,290
- What? - They're not the thieves.

2490
01:22:34,296 --> 01:22:36,660
(The two must not be thieves.)

2491
01:22:36,665 --> 01:22:38,330
- It's not them? - That was the last game, right?

2492
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,965
- Are you the thief? - No, I'm not.

2493
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:45,135
(Why do I feel duped?)

2494
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:47,740
- Why did you stand still? - No, that's not it.

2495
01:22:47,743 --> 01:22:49,840
- That's not it. - Why did you?

2496
01:22:49,845 --> 01:22:51,810
(He had to stop her.)

2497
01:22:51,814 --> 01:22:54,310
(Han Na shakes hands with Haha.)

2498
01:22:54,316 --> 01:22:56,145
Good job.

2499
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:57,580
It's what I wanted.

2500
01:22:57,586 --> 01:22:58,880
- Good job. - Okay.

2501
01:22:58,887 --> 01:22:59,880
Good job.

2502
01:22:59,888 --> 01:23:01,720
(Was this all planned out?)

2503
01:23:01,724 --> 01:23:05,225
(After the 2nd round, their identities were revealed.)

2504
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:10,260
(Both of them were citizens.)

2505
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:14,230
(If the thieves knew about them, they would be targeted.)

2506
01:23:14,236 --> 01:23:19,200
(They decided to switch teams in order to be safe.)

2507
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,570
(They planned to switch with Kwang Soo and Joy...)

2508
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:22,240
(who were highly likely to be citizens.)

2509
01:23:22,244 --> 01:23:23,740
I'll also make it seem like you're a thief.

2510
01:23:23,746 --> 01:23:25,310
All right. And then...

2511
01:23:25,314 --> 01:23:27,510
- Let's act when we get out. - All right.

2512
01:23:27,516 --> 01:23:31,280
(This couple had schemed a big picture.)

2513
01:23:31,286 --> 01:23:35,150
(Everything worked out the way they planned it.)

2514
01:23:35,157 --> 01:23:37,320
(If she's also a citizen, who is the other thief?)

2515
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:39,820
We have finished all the games.

2516
01:23:39,828 --> 01:23:42,060
I will now tell you the results.

2517
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:44,360
- We'll start with Joy. - All right.

2518
01:23:44,366 --> 01:23:45,630
(They'll find out her identity.)

2519
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:47,130
Turn around.

2520
01:23:47,136 --> 01:23:49,435
1, 2, 3.

2521
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:51,670
She was a citizen.

2522
01:23:51,673 --> 01:23:53,470
(Yes, I succeeded.)

2523
01:23:53,475 --> 01:23:55,270
- Kim Jong Kook. - I did it.

2524
01:23:55,277 --> 01:23:57,540
- You're a thief. - He must be.

2525
01:23:57,546 --> 01:23:59,645
(If he's a thief, he wins.)

2526
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:02,145
(Exclaiming)

2527
01:24:02,885 --> 01:24:06,250
(Why, deities, have you forsaken me by giving me a thief?)

2528
01:24:06,255 --> 01:24:08,150
It was all for you.

2529
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:09,720
(I'm sorry, Joy.)

2530
01:24:09,725 --> 01:24:12,020
- You were a thief? - You were?

2531
01:24:12,027 --> 01:24:13,720
Joy will be penalized.

2532
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:16,125
Jong Kook will receive a reward.

2533
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:17,660
Next couple, please.

2534
01:24:17,666 --> 01:24:20,330
We'll check Haha and Han Na.

2535
01:24:20,335 --> 01:24:22,565
I'm curious about Han Na.

2536
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:24,770
We thought Han Na was a thief.

2537
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:27,235
She is.

2538
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:28,570
- Citizen. - Citizen.

2539
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:30,470
- He wasn't a thief. - Han Na's a thief.

2540
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:32,945
- Then it's Han Na? - It's Han Na.

2541
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:36,580
(We're both citizens. We duped you.)

2542
01:24:36,585 --> 01:24:39,950
(Through their fearless switching of teams and scheming, they've won.)

2543
01:24:39,955 --> 01:24:43,720
(While these two are celebrating,)

2544
01:24:43,725 --> 01:24:44,720
(Kwang Soo is lost for words.)

2545
01:24:44,726 --> 01:24:46,990
Why did you do it?

2546
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:50,260
(Does that mean I voluntarily abandoned a citizen?)

2547
01:24:50,265 --> 01:24:51,660
Wait.

2548
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,330
Han Na is very smart.

2549
01:24:53,335 --> 01:24:55,330
No, that's not it. I didn't have plans...

2550
01:24:55,337 --> 01:24:57,600
to switch because I thought Kwang Soo was a citizen.

2551
01:24:57,606 --> 01:25:00,470
- No, that's not it. - I switched grudgingly.

2552
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,575
I thought you were a thief.

2553
01:25:02,744 --> 01:25:04,610
Kwang Soo will be penalized.

2554
01:25:04,613 --> 01:25:06,945
Ji Hyo will receive a reward.

2555
01:25:07,716 --> 01:25:09,545
Next couple.

2556
01:25:09,685 --> 01:25:10,750
Is it us?

2557
01:25:10,752 --> 01:25:13,815
I think Se Chan is a thief.

2558
01:25:14,122 --> 01:25:16,820
(One of them is a thief.)

2559
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:19,020
Are you a thief? Be honest with me.

2560
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:22,795
No, I'm not. Irene, take a good look.

2561
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:26,930
(While slaving for her, no one knew their identities.)

2562
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:28,130
Look.

2563
01:25:28,136 --> 01:25:33,935
(Se Chan went to So Min at the end. What is his identity?)

2564
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:36,670
- He's a citizen. - I was telling the truth.

2565
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:37,840
(He's a citizen.)

2566
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:41,815
(So Min is also a citizen, and they both receive rewards.)

2567
01:25:41,917 --> 01:25:43,780
(If Se Chan is a citizen,)

2568
01:25:43,785 --> 01:25:45,980
(that means Jae Seok is a thief.)

2569
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:47,150
Goodness.

2570
01:25:47,155 --> 01:25:48,920
- Jae Seok is a thief. - No way.

2571
01:25:48,924 --> 01:25:50,920
It's him.

2572
01:25:50,926 --> 01:25:51,920
We'll rip both of theirs at once.

2573
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:53,120
One of them is a thief.

2574
01:25:53,128 --> 01:25:54,960
(Jae Seok's fate is in Irene's hands.)

2575
01:25:54,963 --> 01:25:57,495
I can't believe this.

2576
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:59,330
- Turn around, please. - Okay.

2577
01:25:59,334 --> 01:26:00,630
(If Irene is a thief, Jae Seok gets penalized.)

2578
01:26:00,636 --> 01:26:03,000
I'm really curious about yours.

2579
01:26:03,005 --> 01:26:05,500
I have to watch this as a viewer myself.

2580
01:26:05,507 --> 01:26:09,340
(Everyone's identities will be revealed at this moment.)

2581
01:26:09,344 --> 01:26:10,710
All right. One.

2582
01:26:10,712 --> 01:26:12,810
(Between In A and Irene, who is the thief?)

2583
01:26:12,814 --> 01:26:13,840
Two.

2584
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:15,880
(Between In A and Irene, who is the thief?)

2585
01:26:15,884 --> 01:26:17,515
Three.

2586
01:26:17,786 --> 01:26:20,985
(Irene is a citizen.)

2587
01:26:21,556 --> 01:26:23,220
- Jae Seok! - I'm sorry.

2588
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:26,220
Irene, I'm sorry.

2589
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:28,225
- Irene. - Three.

2590
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:30,760
(In A was a thief.)

2591
01:26:30,766 --> 01:26:32,465
You!

2592
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:35,800
This is shocking.

2593
01:26:35,804 --> 01:26:37,300
- You trusted me. - Irene.

2594
01:26:37,306 --> 01:26:39,505
(This is a hair-raising twist.)

2595
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,270
I'm sorry.

2596
01:26:41,276 --> 01:26:42,470
- Irene. - Who got it right?

2597
01:26:42,477 --> 01:26:43,840
I'm sorry.

2598
01:26:43,845 --> 01:26:45,975
Jae Seok.

2599
01:26:46,048 --> 01:26:48,080
You fooled me perfectly.

2600
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:49,880
(Final Results)

2601
01:26:49,885 --> 01:26:51,880
Here is the penalty.

2602
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:54,350
- I'm curious. - I heard it's intense.

2603
01:26:54,356 --> 01:26:56,050
It's whipped cream.

2604
01:26:56,058 --> 01:26:59,320
They prepared a lot of it.

2605
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,520
Goodness.

2606
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:03,960
(Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Irene, and Joy will be penalized.)

2607
01:27:03,966 --> 01:27:06,230
There are four of you.

2608
01:27:06,234 --> 01:27:07,330
But only two?

2609
01:27:07,336 --> 01:27:08,430
But only two canons.

2610
01:27:08,437 --> 01:27:10,600
Okay!

2611
01:27:10,605 --> 01:27:13,570
(Yes, I have one last chance!)

2612
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:14,670
I can do it.

2613
01:27:14,676 --> 01:27:15,670
(Two of them can go free.)

2614
01:27:15,677 --> 01:27:17,510
- Irene. - So...

2615
01:27:17,512 --> 01:27:20,975
- here is your last chance. - Okay!

2616
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:22,680
- It's the barrel man. - Okay!

2617
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:24,750
(They will play the Pirate Roulette.)

2618
01:27:24,753 --> 01:27:26,950
If he pops up, you'll get penalized.

2619
01:27:26,955 --> 01:27:27,950
(You'll be chosen immediately.)

2620
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:29,020
- All right. - Go first.

2621
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,120
(They start with Irene.)

2622
01:27:31,126 --> 01:27:32,520
If it pops up, you get the penalty.

2623
01:27:32,527 --> 01:27:36,590
(Will Irene's first attempt be a safe one?)

2624
01:27:36,598 --> 01:27:37,630
(She's safe.)

2625
01:27:37,632 --> 01:27:39,430
You lose if it pops up, right?

2626
01:27:39,434 --> 01:27:41,230
- Okay. - Let's do one-by-one.

2627
01:27:41,236 --> 01:27:42,900
- Joy's next. - Right.

2628
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:44,200
Pop out.

2629
01:27:44,206 --> 01:27:48,640
(Will she be safe just like Irene was?)

2630
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:50,275
Pop out.

2631
01:27:51,013 --> 01:27:52,210
(Flying)

2632
01:27:52,214 --> 01:27:55,310
(The barrel man says hi.)

2633
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:57,315
(Collapsing)

2634
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,750
(Joy is chosen for the penalty.)

2635
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:02,150
Joy...

2636
01:28:02,157 --> 01:28:05,120
(They're halfway there.)

2637
01:28:05,127 --> 01:28:07,190
- Joy! - Yes! Yes!

2638
01:28:07,195 --> 01:28:09,425
(Only 1 more spot remains.)

2639
01:28:10,732 --> 01:28:13,660
Joy, who made the barrel man pop out,

2640
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,930
and another person of her pick...

2641
01:28:15,937 --> 01:28:17,200
- will be penalized. - Okay.

2642
01:28:17,205 --> 01:28:19,400
(I don't need to say it.)

2643
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:20,670
And another person of her pick...

2644
01:28:20,675 --> 01:28:23,775
(Wait. Is that me?)

2645
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:27,545
Don't you need to count down?

2646
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:31,080
(There's no need. I choose you.)

2647
01:28:31,086 --> 01:28:32,150
- Goodness. - You have to say 1, 2, 3.

2648
01:28:32,154 --> 01:28:35,550
Joy and Kwang Soo will be the ones getting the penalty.

2649
01:28:35,557 --> 01:28:37,290
(They were once separated due to betrayal...)

2650
01:28:37,292 --> 01:28:39,020
(but are beautifully reunited once again.)

2651
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:40,590
- All right. - Smile.

2652
01:28:40,595 --> 01:28:42,225
(Teasing)

2653
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:44,060
I'm feeling great today.

2654
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:46,730
(The schemers always have the last laugh.)

2655
01:28:46,735 --> 01:28:49,030
Are you ready?

2656
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,235
- One... - Here we go.

2657
01:28:51,606 --> 01:28:53,235
Two...

2658
01:28:54,443 --> 01:28:56,040
Three.

2659
01:28:56,044 --> 01:29:00,775
(From the start until the end, they are meant to be.)

2660
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:02,280
(They do say couples look alike.)

2661
01:29:02,284 --> 01:29:03,580
Goodness.

2662
01:29:03,585 --> 01:29:06,150
(It looks like Groot...)

2663
01:29:06,154 --> 01:29:08,550
(and his girlfriend.)

2664
01:29:08,557 --> 01:29:09,720
Goodness.

2665
01:29:09,724 --> 01:29:11,220
Joy, you look pretty.

2666
01:29:11,226 --> 01:29:12,920
- You look great. - You look great too, Joy.

2667
01:29:12,928 --> 01:29:15,090
Who are they?

2668
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:16,660
Joy, take a photo.

2669
01:29:16,665 --> 01:29:17,660
Yes, do that.

2670
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:19,130
1, 2, 3.

2671
01:29:19,134 --> 01:29:20,330
(It was nice to team up, but I hope we never meet again.)

2672
01:29:20,335 --> 01:29:23,530
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2673
01:29:23,538 --> 01:29:26,035
(They are headed somewhere.)

2674
01:29:26,374 --> 01:29:29,405
(Some people are searching for something.)

2675
01:29:29,644 --> 01:29:32,810
(After that thing was touched, everything started.)

2676
01:29:32,814 --> 01:29:34,010
It was here a while ago.

2677
01:29:34,015 --> 01:29:36,710
(Objects keep disappearing.)

2678
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:40,380
(Some of the ladies are suspicious.)

2679
01:29:40,388 --> 01:29:44,555
(Ever since they appeared, things became strange.)

2680
01:29:44,626 --> 01:29:47,120
(They are not the cute ladies we once knew.)

2681
01:29:47,129 --> 01:29:49,260
(They strive to reveal the girls' secret.)

2682
01:29:49,264 --> 01:29:52,060
