1
00:00:07,083 --> 00:00:09,552
- Don't do that. It's the new year. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,552 --> 00:00:11,121
- Hello. Happy New Year. - Hi.

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:13,223
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

4
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:15,692
- His outfits are improving. - He's all dressed up.

5
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,460
Gosh, no, no. Stop it. You're making me blush.

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,062
(Come on. Don't make me blush now.)

7
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,297
- This is embarrassing. - Doesn't he...

8
00:00:20,297 --> 00:00:21,298
- look great? - It's hot in here.

9
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:22,399
(Jae Seok shows up next.)

10
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,100
- What's going on? - Jae Seok.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,169
- A shearling jacket. - I wore a shearling jacket.

12
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,871
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

13
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,539
You look like pickled radish!

14
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:31,141
Pickled radish!

15
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,610
- Pickled radish! - I don't look like pickled radish.

16
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,845
You do. You look like you jumped out of gimbap.

17
00:00:35,845 --> 00:00:38,148
You called me Jaws Bar at Entertainment Awards.

18
00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:39,649
Now, you call me pickled radish.

19
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,784
For goodness' sake.

20
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,619
(She goes from Jaws Bar to pickled radish.)

21
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:45,021
- Se Chan dressed up today. - No, I didn't.

22
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:47,857
- Stop it, So Min. - Look at his ankles.

23
00:00:47,857 --> 00:00:48,958
My goodness.

24
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,428
Se Chan, your ankles will ache when you get old.

25
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:53,063
- You will get arthritis. - It's okay.

26
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,364
Your ankles will ache.

27
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,199
I am only 33 years old.

28
00:00:57,801 --> 00:00:59,069
You deserve a beating.

29
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,338
I am 38 years old now. It's a disaster.

30
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,073
- Are you 38 years old? - Yes.

31
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:04,774
You are pushing 40!

32
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,143
(You are pushing 40!)

33
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:10,213
(Song Ji Hyo, a woman who is pushing 40)

34
00:01:10,213 --> 00:01:11,247
Ji Hyo.

35
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,615
(They exchange blessings to start the year.)

36
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,883
You are pushing 40.

37
00:01:13,883 --> 00:01:16,252
- No one will think she is 38. - Happy New Year!

38
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,254
- Happy New Year! - Happy New Year!

39
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:19,622
What are you doing?

40
00:01:19,723 --> 00:01:21,391
Every day is a festival.

41
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,759
- Happy New Year! - Jae Seok.

42
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,594
- Why did you take off the jacket? - What happened?

43
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,929
- Hurry up, and bring the jacket. - I was startled...

44
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:27,497
- when I looked in the mirror. - Why?

45
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,598
The shoulders were too much.

46
00:01:28,598 --> 00:01:29,699
(The earlier outfit was too much.)

47
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,935
I wanted to talk about it during the opening! Why did you change?

48
00:01:33,737 --> 00:01:36,906
(5 minutes ago, Jae Seok entered for the 1st time)

49
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,877
(Power shoulders)

50
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,513
(He looked like he just played a game of rugby.)

51
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,416
Don't say anything before the opening.

52
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:47,851
He figured it out on his own.

53
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,319
- Really? - He had an instinct.

54
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:52,389
So Min was forced to look like a high school student.

55
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:54,691
A flashback. A flashback.

56
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,825
A flashback.

57
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:58,661
In dramas, main characters are sometimes forced...

58
00:01:58,795 --> 00:02:00,263
to look like high school students.

59
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:02,298
- That's right. - She is trying to look young.

60
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,401
- A flashback. - She went too far back in the past.

61
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:05,668
- That's right. - That's the impression I got.

62
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,137
It makes it impossible for you to enjoy the drama.

63
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,572
I thought her hair was dried herring.

64
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:11,174
(Is this hair or herring?)

65
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:12,275
Seriously.

66
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,010
- Why did you wear Hyun Woo's coat? - I didn't.

67
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,712
(Hyun Woo is his son.)

68
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,746
It's not his.

69
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:18,381
He wants to look cute.

70
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:19,382
- Isn't it Hyun Woo's? - It's his wife's.

71
00:02:19,382 --> 00:02:20,717
- Is it your wife's? - No, it's not.

72
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,453
The winner of Top Excellence Award wants to look cute.

73
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:25,755
I asked my stylist to bring clothes that will make me look young...

74
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:26,790
- and this happened. - In any case,

75
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,258
Seok Jin won Top Excellence Award.

76
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,793
Congratulations.

77
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:31,127
(We congratulate Seok Jin on winning Top Excellence Award.)

78
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:33,730
Running Man, Jee Seok Jin.

79
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,398
(Last year, "Entertainment Awards")

80
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:37,967
(Seok Jin did it!)

81
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,536
It is thanks to you...

82
00:02:39,536 --> 00:02:41,771
that I am where I am.

83
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:44,274
I will run to the best of my abilities. Thank you.

84
00:02:44,274 --> 00:02:45,608
(I will run to the best of my abilities.)

85
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:46,776
Congratulations.

86
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,678
Thank you.

87
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,548
- His diligence and effort paid off. - You're right.

88
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:53,249
It's all thanks to the dear members.

89
00:02:53,249 --> 00:02:56,186
There is no use in saying much as this won't air until later.

90
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:58,054
You want to say "These jerks" instead, right?

91
00:02:58,054 --> 00:03:00,056
(You want to say "These jerks" instead, right?)

92
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,226
"These jerks".

93
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,828
(What's the story behind "These jerks"?)

94
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:06,262
Thank you.

95
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:08,064
Seok Jin and I...

96
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:10,333
left the get-together early after "Entertainment Awards".

97
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,601
(At a get-together after "Entertainment Awards",)

98
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:12,802
(Seok Jin picked up the tab and left.)

99
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:13,803
How much is the total?

100
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:15,038
(He looked very manly.)

101
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:17,474
- It's not very expensive. - Thank you for the food.

102
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:20,677
Seok Jin and I left early because we had work the next day.

103
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,711
As he exited the restaurant, he said,

104
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:24,581
"I can't believe these jerks."

105
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:26,216
(I can't believe these jerks.)

106
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,353
(Did you really say that?)

107
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:31,588
Really?

108
00:03:31,588 --> 00:03:32,755
The total...

109
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,591
was quite expensive.

110
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,825
You know,

111
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,560
I had never seen people order takeout...

112
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,128
at a barbecue restaurant.

113
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:41,798
(He reveals how he truly felt.)

114
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,266
You told us to do that.

115
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,801
Did you see Jae Seok?

116
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,569
- He took a lot of pork belly. - 12 servings.

117
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:47,770
(He took a lot of pork belly.)

118
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,740
(He really ordered meat to go.)

119
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:52,242
12 servings.

120
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:53,810
(12 servings of pork belly)

121
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:57,380
(He ordered an entire pig to go.)

122
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,382
You told me to order meat to go.

123
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,585
In any case,

124
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,120
it's a happy occasion.

125
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,588
So Min won the Rookie Award.

126
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:06,756
(She won the Rookie Award.)

127
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:08,324
Kwang Soo and So Min won the Best Couple Award.

128
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:10,493
- The Best Couple Award. - Yes.

129
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:13,329
Running Man, Jeon So Min. Congratulations.

130
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:15,064
Congratulations.

131
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:17,567
(She received the honor of winning the Rookie Award.)

132
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,369
My goodness. I am sorry.

133
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,404
- I mean... - It's okay.

134
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,607
I love you. Thank you.

135
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:28,711
Lee Kwang Soo and Jeon So Min couple.

136
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:31,948
(Kwang Soo and So Min won the Best Couple Award.)

137
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:34,083
He is a mature man.

138
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,019
Aren't you glad I said that?

139
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,023
We are a bit more than colleagues.

140
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,660
So Min won three awards.

141
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,028
- You are right. - So Min won three awards.

142
00:04:45,028 --> 00:04:47,564
I shamelessly made Seok Jin pick up the tab.

143
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,365
- It's okay. - On that day,

144
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,134
I thought Jae Seok would help me.

145
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:53,836
Jae Seok suddenly stood up and said,

146
00:04:53,836 --> 00:04:56,739
"Is Seok Jin the only one who received an award?"

147
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,408
Then everyone said,

148
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:00,910
- "Jeon So Min! Jeon So Min!" - That's right.

149
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:02,312
"However,"

150
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:03,913
"who won the Top Excellence Award?"

151
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,516
- "Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!" - "Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!"

152
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:07,784
(The answer is obvious.)

153
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:11,087
(Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!)

154
00:05:11,721 --> 00:05:13,823
You can order takeout today!

155
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:16,659
- Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!

156
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:19,596
Seok Jin thinks we are joking.

157
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:22,832
(I can't believe these jerks.)

158
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,634
That night, I talked in my sleep.

159
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:27,637
"Jee Seok Jin! Jee Seok Jin!"

160
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:30,607
- My voice went hoarse. - Mine did, too.

161
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,542
The person who got drunk the most...

162
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:33,676
was Park Na Rae.

163
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,844
(The person who got drunk the most was Park Na Rae.)

164
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,512
(Drunk Park Na Rae)

165
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:38,147
Why was she there?

166
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:42,585
(Park Na Rae was invited to the get-together.)

167
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,754
(The owner of Na Rae Bar...)

168
00:05:44,754 --> 00:05:49,058
(enjoyed the get-together to the fullest.)

169
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,994
She was completely drunk.

170
00:05:50,994 --> 00:05:53,129
She had a get-together for an award she received the day before...

171
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,998
- with Running Man. - She's too much.

172
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,599
- Seriously. - She enjoyed herself.

173
00:05:56,599 --> 00:05:58,368
She didn't drink at first. When I asked why she wasn't drinking,

174
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,470
she said, "It will be unbecoming if I get drunk here."

175
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:02,405
At the end, when I asked if she is okay,

176
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,906
she gave me the finger.

177
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,242
(Na Rae showed them the epitome of drunkenness.)

178
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,410
She was completely drunk.

179
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,245
I feel like Na Rae should visit the show.

180
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,347
- She should. - That's right.

181
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,582
Today,

182
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:15,018
we will welcome the New Year by renewing Running Man.

183
00:06:15,018 --> 00:06:17,754
We will have a race to determine who will be in the TV rating notice.

184
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:19,322
- TV rating notice. - TV rating notice.

185
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,657
It is shown in the beginning of the show.

186
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,894
(This is TV rating notice.)

187
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:26,829
- It's shown every week. - Yes.

188
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,465
The winner of today's race...

189
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:30,767
will be the director of the TV rating notice...

190
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:33,002
and freely decide what to show in five seconds.

191
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:35,371
(The winner of the race can direct the 5-second TV rating notice.)

192
00:06:35,838 --> 00:06:37,607
- Alone? - The new TV rating notice...

193
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,242
will be aired for a month.

194
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,476
- A month? - Yes.

195
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,445
Then you can be the main member.

196
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:44,313
- For an example, - I will try my best to win.

197
00:06:44,313 --> 00:06:46,049
I can stand at the front and have the others in the back...

198
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:48,217
- if I am the director. - You will have free rein.

199
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:50,520
If I win, I will make Jae Seok wear that jacket.

200
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,221
(I'm going to make him wear that jacket.)

201
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,223
(Power shoulders)

202
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,958
- For goodness' sake. - We didn't get to make fun of him.

203
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,627
- He can do that, right? - If I say,

204
00:06:57,627 --> 00:06:59,929
"Kwang Soo, stand naked," does he have to follow?

205
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:02,198
(If I say, "Kwang Soo, stand naked," does he have to follow?)

206
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:03,399
He can take off his top.

207
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,867
This show is for 12 years and older.

208
00:07:04,867 --> 00:07:06,969
- 12 years and older. - What's wrong with you?

209
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,705
I can't stand naked and say,

210
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,707
"This show is for 12 years and older."

211
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:13,276
So Min, this show is for 12 years and older.

212
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,813
There's a rumor that our rating is changing because of you.

213
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,581
Running Man almost became a pay-per-view show because of you.

214
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,782
This show won't get aired...

215
00:07:19,782 --> 00:07:21,150
with that kind of TV rating notice.

216
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,152
As a result, the winner will make a storyboard...

217
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,488
of the TV rating notice you want to see...

218
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,024
and give a presentation.

219
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:29,225
(What will the winner want to do?)

220
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:30,960
What should I do?

221
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,230
- Can we use the water bomb? - You can use anything.

222
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,598
- Can we film it anywhere? - Yes.

223
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:37,100
Let's go to Nevis Swing again.

224
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,836
(Let's go to Nevis Swing again.)

225
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:42,371
- I will film in Korea. - Don't do that.

226
00:07:42,371 --> 00:07:43,806
As I say, "Running Man is for 12 years and older,"

227
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:45,775
the rest of you will be on Nevis Swing. Okay.

228
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:48,945
(Is that how you're going to be?)

229
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,246
My mind is set.

230
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:51,981
(Peeking)

231
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:54,650
- We will be at a zoo. - Look at his drawing!

232
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,385
We will be at a zoo.

233
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:59,255
(Is this Jae Seok's zoo?)

234
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:01,424
You are worse than Ji Ho, your son.

235
00:08:01,524 --> 00:08:02,959
Ji Ho is can draw better than me.

236
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:06,229
- "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals". - I also have big plans.

237
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:07,830
Should So Min be...

238
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:09,432
a frog or a parrot?

239
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:11,367
Should So Min be a frog?

240
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,269
Make her upper body a frog's and her lower body a parrot's.

241
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,139
- What? - That would be scary.

242
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,974
- It's like a collaboration. - That would be scary.

243
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,575
Just you wait.

244
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,544
My goodness.

245
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:23,079
I am worried about what So Min will do.

246
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,947
What kind of an animal is Se Chan?

247
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,249
I am a bear, right?

248
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:28,618
(A cute bear?)

249
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:29,886
You aren't a bear.

250
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,754
- I am strong. - You are fish.

251
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:33,022
- You aren't a bear. - You are fish.

252
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,357
Catfish.

253
00:08:34,357 --> 00:08:35,625
Catfish?

254
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,794
- I am not catfish! - Se Chan.

255
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,929
We don't have any fish.

256
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,731
A catfish suits you.

257
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:42,965
- A catfish is a good one. - Hold on.

258
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:44,433
Kwang Soo is a giraffe.

259
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,369
(Walking over)

260
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:47,703
Hold on. Let me take a look.

261
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:49,739
- Let me see how it looks. - Draw feelers.

262
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:55,845
(Which one is the real catfish?)

263
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:58,114
You are a catfish.

264
00:08:58,114 --> 00:08:59,682
- It's a permanent marker. - It's a permanent marker.

265
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,951
- It's an oil-based marker. - It's a permanent marker.

266
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,019
(It's an oil-based marker.)

267
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,788
Do you want me to walk around like this all day?

268
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,223
I am sorry.

269
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,457
You look like a catfish.

270
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:11,227
- Jae Seok, do something. - I am sorry.

271
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:13,296
(Seok Jin gets up.)

272
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:15,932
- Jae Seok, do something. - I am sorry.

273
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:17,266
I can't do anything about it.

274
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,101
(Rubbing)

275
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,070
You can't erase it with an eraser.

276
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:23,172
It's working.

277
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:28,311
(He gets a more realistic mustache.)

278
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:29,879
- Come on! - He became Woong's father.

279
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,480
It's Woong's father!

280
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,950
I guess there are things you can't erase with an eraser.

281
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,319
Are you acting this way because you won an award?

282
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:39,121
(Are you acting this way because you won an award?)

283
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,256
For goodness' sake.

284
00:09:40,256 --> 00:09:41,490
Okay, so he's a catfish.

285
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,558
(It's funny, right?)

286
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,594
They will let us do this.

287
00:09:44,594 --> 00:09:45,928
(They carefully make a storyboard for their 5 seconds.)

288
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:48,364
I can be a king.

289
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:49,932
Then I will do...

290
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:51,767
I will go to the fish market.

291
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,035
(My imagination will become real.)

292
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:54,270
This is...

293
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,938
like a dream. The thought of directing this scene...

294
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:58,007
- makes me so excited. - Seok Jin.

295
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,242
You won't be able to do it.

296
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:01,410
(You won't be able to do it.)

297
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,613
(The chance is slimmer than winning a lottery.)

298
00:10:03,613 --> 00:10:04,747
Wait, and see.

299
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:06,449
That's why I am not curious about your idea.

300
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,651
There is a twist. It's five seconds.

301
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,052
(They can't wait to see whose idea will win.)

302
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,954
- Is the current one five seconds? - Yes.

303
00:10:11,954 --> 00:10:14,056
- This isn't easy. - Seok Jin gets...

304
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,992
the most amount of screen time in the TV rating notice.

305
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:17,660
(He attacks with a fact.)

306
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,462
(Say that again, you jerk.)

307
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:20,730
Seriously.

308
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,633
- It's five seconds. - Excuse me?

309
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:27,036
5 seconds is long for him. He usually appears for 4 seconds.

310
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,939
- Se Chan, you're laughing too loud. - It's funny.

311
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,744
(Meanwhile, the high-schooler, So Min is...)

312
00:10:34,844 --> 00:10:39,015
(letting her imagination run wild.)

313
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:40,149
So Min, what are you drawing?

314
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,319
I'm drawing an underwater scene.

315
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:47,723
But I can't come up with anything cruel.

316
00:10:47,723 --> 00:10:49,458
Why would you come up with something cruel?

317
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,360
- What's with you? - Don't do that.

318
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,663
Or...

319
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:56,699
I'll make Jae Seok and Jong Kook kiss.

320
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,703
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook will kiss?)

321
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,038
Gosh.

322
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,473
This show is for the ages of 12 and over.

323
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:07,343
Please remember that.

324
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:08,611
(Disappointed)

325
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:10,112
My goodness.

326
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,382
Kwang Soo, why did you draw water bombs in the background?

327
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,450
You saw it right.

328
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,085
He doesn't realize he'll get hit with the water too.

329
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,153
(Are you talking about these water bombs?)

330
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,655
Fine, in my animal kingdom,

331
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:21,724
there will be a water bomb above just the giraffe.

332
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,858
I like that.

333
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,194
Okay. You're not wearing anything in my drawing.

334
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:28,397
- What? - Nothing under that green jacket.

335
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,099
I'll remove the water bomb.

336
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,001
All right. Then I'll give you clothes.

337
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:34,303
Okay. That sounds good.

338
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,639
(I like Kwang Soo's idea.)

339
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,674
Please present your ideas.

340
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,710
Mine is called...

341
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:43,245
Running Man's Sea Story.

342
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,847
"Running Man's Sea Story"?

343
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:48,417
(Running Man's Sea Story)

344
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:52,188
- Sea Story is dangerous. - It's the name of an adult game.

345
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,723
(Even the title is problematic.)

346
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,524
Why did she give it such a name?

347
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:59,061
- Everything she does... - Running Man Under the Sea.

348
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:02,365
Kwang Soo is seaweed.

349
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,899
(Kwang Soo is seaweed.)

350
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:05,368
Make me into a living creature.

351
00:12:05,368 --> 00:12:06,969
- I want to be a living creature. - That's nice.

352
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,070
- I like that. - I want to be able to move.

353
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,708
He'll be standing on ice, wearing green tights.

354
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,944
Please make sure his underwear lines don't show.

355
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:17,446
- So Min. - He'll be painted green all over.

356
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,349
I would like you to make...

357
00:12:20,349 --> 00:12:22,685
his outfit moist.

358
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,621
As you expected, Se Chan will be a catfish.

359
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,590
Please prepare some mud.

360
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,993
- He'll be lying in mud. - Mud?

361
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,695
- I hope she won't win. - Se Chan will...

362
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:33,963
be covered in mud.

363
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,097
I think Se Chan will look cute.

364
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,666
Wearing all that costume, we'll appear for 0.1 seconds.

365
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,870
As Ji Hyo is a girl...

366
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,406
Ji Hyo will be a red carp.

367
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:46,142
I want her costume to be covered with spangles.

368
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,044
Don't be just nice to Ji Hyo.

369
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:49,979
So Min!

370
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,647
Ji Hyo should look pretty.

371
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,049
She's happy she can wear spangles.

372
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:54,216
(She's happy.)

373
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:56,919
Spangles are nice.

374
00:12:59,288 --> 00:13:01,857
Jong Kook will be a rock.

375
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:03,125
(Jong Kook will be a rock.)

376
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,360
(I'm a rock?)

377
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,662
Like Gollum...

378
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,031
Jong Kook doesn't expect much from you.

379
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:13,035
I want his costume to have a hole here.

380
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:15,838
Hey, we can't do that on a show for 12 and over.

381
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:18,207
- His chest and belly should show. - We can't show our skin.

382
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,608
- He'll be a rock. - Why...

383
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:23,045
Why do you decide how much skin I should show?

384
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,214
Like this.

385
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,917
Celebrities are sensitive about showing their skin.

386
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,754
Seok Jin will be sticking to Jong Kook's shoulder.

387
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,322
- Me? - Yes.

388
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:35,691
- He's a sea urchin. - Can you show all that?

389
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:38,094
- In five seconds? - We have only five seconds.

390
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:40,096
Everyone will appear at the same time.

391
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,331
Seok Jin will have to curl up.

392
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:45,067
His arms and legs should be inside the costume.

393
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:47,703
- I have to curl up? - Like this.

394
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:49,405
- I'm a sea urchin? - Yes, you have to curl up.

395
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:51,974
Make Seok Jin a part of a picture puzzle.

396
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,609
- Will there be a prize? - Haha will...

397
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:56,479
be an octopus spitting ink.

398
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:59,849
I was too nice.

399
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,318
- Mine is too nice too. - Give us five more minutes.

400
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,919
- Give us 5 more minutes. - Give us 10 more.

401
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:06,021
- No. - Mine is too nice.

402
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:10,059
Also, look at Jae Seok.

403
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:11,694
He's an anchovy.

404
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:14,296
(Jae Seok is an anchovy.)

405
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:17,566
- What are you talking about? - It suits him.

406
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,535
So Min is good at casting.

407
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,403
He looks like an anchovy.

408
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,373
His costume has to be very tight.

409
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,876
It has to be really tight, so he looks very thin.

410
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,545
I can't have the shape of an anchovy.

411
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:33,582
The anchovy will be very tiny.

412
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,084
(Tiny?)

413
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,986
Why do you keep making me tiny?

414
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:39,555
Hey!

415
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:43,058
(Last fall, in the sweet potato field)

416
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:46,428
(Jae Seok's is tiny.)

417
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,665
(Hey, say it properly.)

418
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:53,936
(His nickname became Small Jae Seok.)

419
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:56,038
Why do you make me tiny?

420
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:57,373
- Small Jae Seok. - Hey!

421
00:14:57,373 --> 00:14:59,275
It's Small Jae Seok.

422
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:00,876
You did it in the chili pepper field too.

423
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,077
(He's angry.)

424
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:03,379
I mean...

425
00:15:03,379 --> 00:15:04,480
Small Jae Seok.

426
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,682
- Hold on. - It was a sweet potato field.

427
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,784
- A chili pepper field? - What's with him?

428
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,054
- It wasn't a chili pepper field. - Did you just admit it?

429
00:15:12,054 --> 00:15:13,923
- This is an inferiority complex. - No, it's not that.

430
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,824
(I'm sure of it.)

431
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:19,128
- No, I don't! - He feels inferior.

432
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:20,696
So Min...

433
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,598
Small Jae Seok. Gosh.

434
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:24,400
He's famous.

435
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,068
- He's famous? - Really?

436
00:15:26,068 --> 00:15:28,437
Everyone in this field knows.

437
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,706
What?

438
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:32,741
(You are watching storyboards that are fit for those 12 and over.)

439
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:34,643
- Has the word spread? - Yes.

440
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:39,014
I'll walk by, saying, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

441
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,983
(I'll just walk by.)

442
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,084
What?

443
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:44,720
There's still two more seconds.

444
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:48,991
Then you'll just spit some ink.

445
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,360
(Octopus Haha will wrap it up.)

446
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,130
You can have two seconds to yourself.

447
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:57,700
How much ink will he have to spit?

448
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,136
Please write, "12",

449
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,238
with ink.

450
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:03,872
Why am I not unhappy?

451
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,274
That was creative.

452
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,176
He's happy he can appear for two seconds.

453
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,445
It wasn't bad.

454
00:16:09,445 --> 00:16:11,313
(Someone is furious.)

455
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:13,148
So Min, you shouldn't be a frog.

456
00:16:13,148 --> 00:16:14,750
That'd be too comfortable.

457
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,019
- This is not okay. - I shouldn't have gone first.

458
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,153
It wasn't a good idea.

459
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,588
(I shouldn't have gone first.)

460
00:16:19,722 --> 00:16:21,023
You might not see it well.

461
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:22,324
Let me explain.

462
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:25,194
The title is, "There's a lot to Learn from Running Man".

463
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,564
(There's a lot to Learn from Running Man.)

464
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:33,636
I want to shoot it at Myeongjeong Hall in Changgyeong Palace.

465
00:16:34,236 --> 00:16:36,605
- I know that place. - I want to shoot there.

466
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,874
I'll be the king,

467
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,610
and the others will carry my palanquin.

468
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:44,647
In the opening scene,

469
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:46,582
we'll show Seok Jin's trophy.

470
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:49,285
And Seok Jin will smash it.

471
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:52,554
(Seok Jin will smash his own trophy.)

472
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,024
- My trophy? - "I don't deserve this!"

473
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:58,494
(I don't deserve this!)

474
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:01,163
This is not mine!

475
00:17:01,697 --> 00:17:03,666
- It's okay. - He even treated us to dinner.

476
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,301
- I like that. - And...

477
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:07,436
The servant who fans the king...

478
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,104
will be Jong Kook.

479
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:11,874
- He'll be shirtless. - Hold on.

480
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:14,410
(Jong Kook will be shirtless.)

481
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,745
- Why am I always shirtless? - This show is for 12 and over.

482
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:19,581
Jong Kook is shirtless in every scenario.

483
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,151
- You have no choice. - I can't.

484
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,586
Let's avoid going shirtless.

485
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,389
Haha, Seok Jin, and Kwang Soo...

486
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,692
will be horses.

487
00:17:29,692 --> 00:17:31,794
- They'll pull the palanquin. - Goodness.

488
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:35,064
- I'm a horse? - Here comes the climax.

489
00:17:35,064 --> 00:17:39,068
I'll whip the horses, saying, "Let's go watch Running Man."

490
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:42,805
The horses will say, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

491
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:44,740
That's it.

492
00:17:44,907 --> 00:17:46,108
It's not bad, is it?

493
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,377
Who will be whipped?

494
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:50,579
Someone popular should be whipped.

495
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,580
You're right.

496
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,915
- So I chose Jae Seok. - Nice.

497
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,750
(As Jae Seok is popular, he'll be whipped.)

498
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,218
I like that.

499
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,421
Okay. That was nice.

500
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:00,589
(Will Se Chan's dream come true?)

501
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,623
Ji Hyo.

502
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,460
I think mine is the simplest and the most straightforward.

503
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,262
- What is it? - We'll be using our bodies.

504
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:12,634
(Use Your Bodies)

505
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,037
This looks simple, but these letters are made of humans.

506
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:17,406
- It's us. - Are they bodies?

507
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,041
(Those letters are us?)

508
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:21,176
Use a drone camera or something.

509
00:18:21,677 --> 00:18:25,247
- 1, 2... - With our bodies?

510
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:26,682
- Yes, with our bodies. - Really?

511
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,484
- Wearing tights? - Yes.

512
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,387
Now that I think of it,

513
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:33,155
maybe our faces should be covered too.

514
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,157
(Our faces should be covered too.)

515
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,127
Then why does it have to be us?

516
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:39,428
We don't have to do it.

517
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:41,597
Hire some extras.

518
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,699
- Hire people. - No.

519
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,434
We'll show them...

520
00:18:45,434 --> 00:18:48,437
how well we can work together even without...

521
00:18:48,437 --> 00:18:51,173
- seeing each other's face. - It has a message.

522
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,409
What message?

523
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:55,144
- Does that make sense? - It can be fun.

524
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:56,278
Does that make sense?

525
00:18:56,278 --> 00:18:58,480
- I don't want to do this. - This really is for 12 and over.

526
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,750
- Everything we do is a penalty. - This is not okay.

527
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,720
- This wasn't the intention. - Let's have one normal scenario.

528
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,588
It's not supposed to be like this.

529
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:08,657
I'm not going to make Jong Kook take off his shirt.

530
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:11,560
- That's right. - Everyone will be equal.

531
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,929
- Everyone will be equal. - Exactly. You're so nice.

532
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,166
(You're so nice.)

533
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,901
What is this? Are you guys together?

534
00:19:18,934 --> 00:19:20,869
Is there something going on?

535
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,204
Why do you say she's nice?

536
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,939
She is nice.

537
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:27,443
(They've been suspicious since the fortune-telling.)

538
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:29,711
You're nice.

539
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,215
At the end, we'll all do our symbolic pose.

540
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:36,618
We'll do the running pose.

541
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:39,254
I'll say, "Running Man is for 12 and over."

542
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,456
I like it.

543
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:42,458
I like the idea. It has a message.

544
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,725
It's touching.

545
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:47,095
I hate that it'll be shot at a gym.

546
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:50,466
- It's "Healthy Running Man". - I like the title.

547
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:51,867
These are treadmills.

548
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:55,270
(Healthy Running Man)

549
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,406
You drew yourself so cute.

550
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:59,875
That's not how your hair looks.

551
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,143
(It's too cute.)

552
00:20:01,143 --> 00:20:02,845
I'm cute.

553
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:06,982
It's simple. I'll be holding a 12 sign.

554
00:20:06,982 --> 00:20:10,752
I'll say, "Running Man is for 12 and over," looking cute.

555
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,322
The rest will be running at full speed.

556
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,557
(The others will be running at full speed.)

557
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,059
We have to start again if we fall, right?

558
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:18,660
Yes.

559
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,928
(We can't do that.)

560
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:22,331
So Min will be holding 12kg dumbbells.

561
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:24,266
She'll hold it in each hand.

562
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,868
It's for ages 12 and over.

563
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,737
Members will dress up as Young Gu.

564
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,806
What are you talking about?

565
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:32,107
(Dressing up as Young Gu is necessary.)

566
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:33,642
What about Kwang Soo?

567
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,143
- He doesn't need to dress up. - I see.

568
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:37,012
- Why not? - You already look like him.

569
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:38,981
I'm going to dress up too.

570
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:41,450
- I'm jealous of you, Kwang Soo. - I'm going to dress up.

571
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,519
- I'm jealous of you. - I'm going to dress up.

572
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:47,689
It's simple. This is running backwards.

573
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:49,791
- Backwards? - Everyone's back is turned.

574
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,792
The faces aren't visible.

575
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,960
Why would we dress up as Young Gu?

576
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,061
There's no reason.

577
00:20:53,061 --> 00:20:55,297
(There's no reason behind dressing up.)

578
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,699
Why would we do a makeup when we don't face the camera?

579
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:59,768
We'll dress up anyway.

580
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,769
That's terrible.

581
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:02,971
- We show the back of our heads. - This is upsetting.

582
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,207
I think I was too nice.

583
00:21:05,207 --> 00:21:06,575
Why did your storyboard change?

584
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,244
- It keeps changing. - Mine is...

585
00:21:09,244 --> 00:21:12,214
very simple, and there won't be any suffering.

586
00:21:12,214 --> 00:21:14,082
It's called "Yu Jae Seok and the Animals".

587
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,084
You'll play animals.

588
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:19,555
(Yu Jae Seok and the Animals)

589
00:21:19,922 --> 00:21:23,191
I stand in the front.

590
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:26,428
I stand in front of the camera.

591
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:29,998
Jong Kook will either dress up as a cat on a stove...

592
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:32,334
- Jong Kook? - That's cute.

593
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:36,071
Seok Jin dresses up as an impala with a trophy on his head.

594
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,106
(Seok Jin has a trophy on his head.)

595
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:39,608
- He's a unicorn. - A unicorn?

596
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:40,609
- Pardon? - It's a unicorn.

597
00:21:40,609 --> 00:21:42,611
He's an impala who received the Top Excellence Award.

598
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,912
- That's good. - And...

599
00:21:43,912 --> 00:21:47,215
So Min was a frog, but I changed it.

600
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:50,085
She'll be a parrot on a perch.

601
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:53,755
She'll be on an actual perch with a thin bar.

602
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:57,125
(It's a perch with a thin bar.)

603
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:59,895
- It won't be easy to balance. - It's impossible.

604
00:21:59,895 --> 00:22:02,831
So Min has to keep her balance.

605
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,001
She has to hold the bar with her feet.

606
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:07,235
Can you do it?

607
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,837
You have to hold the bar...

608
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:10,539
with your feet like this.

609
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:13,442
So Min has to hold onto the perch like a bird.

610
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:14,643
(She must stand on the perch.)

611
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:16,078
She needs to practice.

612
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:18,714
Lastly, I'll come out.

613
00:22:18,847 --> 00:22:22,784
When I shout, "Running Man," you express age 12.

614
00:22:22,784 --> 00:22:24,086
- With our body? - Yes.

615
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:25,420
How?

616
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,488
It's like Ji Hyo's.

617
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:27,756
Did you just make that up?

618
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,024
No, I didn't.

619
00:22:29,024 --> 00:22:30,592
You just made it up.

620
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:32,494
- Where is it written? - Come on.

621
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:34,296
- It was my original idea. - Stop applying others' ideas.

622
00:22:34,296 --> 00:22:35,597
- I didn't. - Why would we do it?

623
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,666
- The animals will make 12. - How?

624
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:39,801
You have to come up with how.

625
00:22:39,801 --> 00:22:40,969
We can't express 12.

626
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,804
How is it possible?

627
00:22:42,804 --> 00:22:45,007
As a human being, I don't know. The animals...

628
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,675
- The animals... - You're the director.

629
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,210
How could you not know?

630
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,112
The animals will work together...

631
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,247
- How can animals make 12? - to show 12.

632
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,415
Just do it!

633
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:55,550
- How? - Just do it.

634
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,520
- All right. - How can we make 12?

635
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,689
I'll start up a fight.

636
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,024
(He'll start up a fight?)

637
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:03,325
What?

638
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:05,427
- What did you say? - I'll start up a fight.

639
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,329
You must show age 12.

640
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,799
Then I'll say, "Viewers of 12 years and older".

641
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,101
Take a look. Stop making things up.

642
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,169
That's all I have.

643
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,505
I changed the storyboard a little.

644
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:18,140
- Especially... - You changed a lot.

645
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,610
My idea was a beautiful birthday.

646
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,247
My title is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12".

647
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,382
(A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12)

648
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,751
- That's my title. - What is it?

649
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,420
It means age 12.

650
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,288
(It has no other meaning.)

651
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,657
- It's sensible. - It doesn't make sense.

652
00:23:35,657 --> 00:23:36,692
What doesn't?

653
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,794
What about animals expressing age 12?

654
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,263
- It makes sense. - Nothing makes sense here.

655
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:43,699
What is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12"?

656
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:46,635
If you're 12 years old, you should dress up as one.

657
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,236
You should dress up as a child.

658
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:50,439
- Me? - According to your title...

659
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:52,340
- You're 12 years old. - I'm just me.

660
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,508
- No. - You're 12 years old.

661
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:55,811
You should put rouge on your cheeks and forehead.

662
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,080
Why would I? This is up to me.

663
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,315
(This is my storyboard.)

664
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:03,018
- It's because of the title. - You can't tell me what to do.

665
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,320
- Seok Jin, listen. - You can't change it.

666
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,522
The title is "A Birthday in Seok Jin's World is Age 12".

667
00:24:07,522 --> 00:24:09,257
That means you're 12 years old.

668
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:11,393
- Okay, I'll accept that. - Okay.

669
00:24:11,393 --> 00:24:14,196
(He acts cool.)

670
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:16,765
- I'll accept one idea. - That's right.

671
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:17,766
I'll accept one.

672
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:20,235
You'll need a lot of Botox.

673
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,604
- I'm swollen from laser treatment. - Botox.

674
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,606
(He's swollen from a laser treatment.)

675
00:24:24,606 --> 00:24:26,141
- Next is... - What?

676
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:28,276
Did you get a laser treatment?

677
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:30,178
I said that he'll need a lot of Botox.

678
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,080
He responded, "I got a laser treatment."

679
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,516
(Seok Jin's response is "I got a laser treatment.")

680
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,650
I got a laser treatment.

681
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:38,320
- Goodness. - What is he talking about?

682
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:40,756
- Se Chan used to be a human being, - Human?

683
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:42,290
but he dresses up as Gollum.

684
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,759
(He changes Se Chan to Gollum.)

685
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,393
- Gollum? - He washes my feet.

686
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:48,663
Gollum is an old character. Not many people know about it.

687
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:49,664
It's too old.

688
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,500
That's what I want.

689
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,502
(This is my idea.)

690
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:55,003
Children of age 12 won't know.

691
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:56,872
I won't accept more than one suggestion.

692
00:24:56,872 --> 00:24:59,074
- I only accept the makeup. - Okay.

693
00:24:59,074 --> 00:25:01,643
Next, So Min...

694
00:25:01,743 --> 00:25:06,348
used to be a dancer that the king adores.

695
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,384
- That's a good role. - However, I changed it.

696
00:25:09,384 --> 00:25:11,386
- To what? - She'll be an actor.

697
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,255
- She's reborn. - What kind of actress?

698
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:14,756
(Seok Jin changed her role.)

699
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:15,824
As the Joker.

700
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:17,793
It's a role that I like.

701
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,228
She'll dress up as the Joker.

702
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,229
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

703
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:23,165
The time setting is during Joseon Dynasty.

704
00:25:23,265 --> 00:25:25,167
- The Joker shouldn't come out. - Of course.

705
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:27,135
It's not realistic.

706
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:29,504
The Joker comes out, and Rome comes out.

707
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:31,840
- Seok Jin. - Everything is included. It's okay.

708
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:35,110
Why are you nitpicking my idea?

709
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,145
- Kwang Soo. - Mine is very simple.

710
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:40,215
As you can see, my title is...

711
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:43,351
"2018 Start Afresh".

712
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:46,888
As you can see in the picture, water bombs are installed.

713
00:25:46,888 --> 00:25:49,357
So Min wears Young Gu wig.

714
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:50,525
- Why? - Makeup is simple too.

715
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:52,794
- Jong Kook... - Why am I Young Gu?

716
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:55,630
wears a sleeveless shirt and tights. He's dressed.

717
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,034
Jae Seok wears no makeup except his green jacket.

718
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:02,070
(Jae Seok's costume is his green jacket.)

719
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,872
Bring that jacket. Joo Eun, you have to take it.

720
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,073
What's wrong?

721
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:07,042
- What about the jacket? - It was the funniest.

722
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:09,244
I don't believe this.

723
00:26:09,244 --> 00:26:12,147
All members will get water bombed.

724
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,282
A clean-looking Kwang Soo appears.

725
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,951
Present the age ratings, and frame out.

726
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:19,054
All I say is "Viewers".

727
00:26:19,054 --> 00:26:21,122
- Who says age 12? - That's done by...

728
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,024
- He added it. - each member.

729
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:24,226
(Each member says it.)

730
00:26:24,926 --> 00:26:29,364
Members say each syllable, "Running Man is Age 12."

731
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:33,034
Seok Jin is in Daegu. Jae Seok is in Busan.

732
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,204
Jong Kook is in Gwangju. Haha is in Haenam.

733
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:38,340
He's lost his mind.

734
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,442
- Stop playing. - Goodness.

735
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:43,178
The members getting a water bomb...

736
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:44,946
won't be aired.

737
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,414
- What's the point... - After the water bomb...

738
00:26:46,414 --> 00:26:49,117
- of water bomb when it isn't aired? - That's right.

739
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,886
- I think it'll be fun. - Seriously.

740
00:26:50,886 --> 00:26:52,687
(There's no other reason.)

741
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:54,756
- That's cruel. - I'd feel satisfied.

742
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,858
What kind of idea is that?

743
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:59,361
They'll be on camera after the water bomb.

744
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:00,595
Viewers.

745
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:03,098
- My goodness. - I put everything together.

746
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:04,432
- Okay. - That's all I have.

747
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:07,569
My original idea was something cute.

748
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,137
My original idea was...

749
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:12,073
"Cute Running Man's Seafood Market".

750
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,243
- That's a good idea. - Everyone's costume was nice.

751
00:27:15,243 --> 00:27:18,914
As we walk and chitchat,

752
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:20,715
I wanted to make it pretty.

753
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:21,783
You changed it.

754
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,986
The more I listened to you, the angrier I got.

755
00:27:25,453 --> 00:27:27,188
I completely changed it.

756
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:31,026
This is in one frame. It's a TV screen.

757
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:33,228
(Running Man's Age Rating)

758
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:35,931
It's a PSA that viewers of Running Man must be over age 12.

759
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,967
It's a storyboard. The first scene is...

760
00:27:38,967 --> 00:27:41,803
Seok Jin who is smoking an electronic cigarette.

761
00:27:41,803 --> 00:27:43,171
- It's age 12 years or older. - Is that okay?

762
00:27:43,171 --> 00:27:45,006
Right. It's a public advertisement.

763
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:47,275
Next is Jae Seok watching pornography.

764
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:50,879
- Come on. - Ji Hyo is cursing while drunk.

765
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,115
Next is Kwang Soo and So Min who are fighting.

766
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:58,286
Se Chan writes bad comments on Seok Jin and So Min.

767
00:27:58,286 --> 00:28:00,188
Next is Jong Kook being a bully.

768
00:28:00,455 --> 00:28:03,291
These scenes are shown for one second.

769
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:04,759
Will you cross them out?

770
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,363
Then I tear them all and jump out of the screen.

771
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,134
Then I say, "No, Running Man is for age 12 years or older."

772
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:14,569
That's it.

773
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:20,408
(Haha denounces the bad actions of adults.)

774
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,243
That's complete nonsense.

775
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,445
- It's simple. - It's nonsense.

776
00:28:23,445 --> 00:28:25,547
If you look carefully,

777
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:29,250
water bombs are installed everywhere.

778
00:28:29,317 --> 00:28:32,320
After being aired for 1 second, they get a water bomb for 0.5 second.

779
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,688
Then I come out of the screen.

780
00:28:33,688 --> 00:28:36,024
- Come out of the screen, my foot. - I do.

781
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:39,761
Put ink inside Jae Seok's water bomb.

782
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:43,131
(Haha won't tolerate Jae Seok.)

783
00:28:43,131 --> 00:28:45,300
There's also mud.

784
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,501
My goodness.

785
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,337
- There's also mud. - There's nothing good.

786
00:28:49,337 --> 00:28:51,139
- It's hard to decide. - There's nothing good.

787
00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:53,608
Will the idea that wins first place...

788
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,143
be aired for one month?

789
00:28:55,143 --> 00:28:58,279
It'll be aired 8 times including Part 1 and 2.

790
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,082
- That's amazing. - I want to win first place today.

791
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:02,584
- Really? - I'm being serious.

792
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:04,285
Jae Seok can't win today...

793
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,154
- I want to win. - unless we want to suffer.

794
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:07,756
There are ones who shouldn't win.

795
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:11,026
I think Ji Hyo's is the worst. Our faces won't be shown.

796
00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:13,361
- Ji Hyo's is easy. - How can we make 12?

797
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,897
It's not about being simple.

798
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:17,365
There's nothing wrong with Ji Hyo's.

799
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:19,034
(There's nothing wrong with hers.)

800
00:29:19,034 --> 00:29:21,669
- Are you in a relationship? - Will you act as a couple?

801
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:22,771
What's going on?

802
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,439
There's not much to do for Ji Hyo's.

803
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:26,474
- All we do is dress up. - I wasn't going to say it.

804
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:30,078
I wasn't going to say it, but why are you together so often?

805
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:31,112
What do you mean?

806
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:33,081
You were together during the get-together.

807
00:29:33,081 --> 00:29:35,984
- Are you in a relationship? - They're suspicious.

808
00:29:36,017 --> 00:29:37,919
Will I lose all my money?

809
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,888
- Lose what? - I bet all of my money...

810
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:41,756
that they aren't in a relationship.

811
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:48,063
(Last Christmas, a romance began between Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

812
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:54,102
(Seok Jin bet all of his money that they aren't in a relationship.)

813
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:55,437
I want Seok Jin's money.

814
00:29:55,437 --> 00:29:59,140
Someone wrote that he wants to see me penniless.

815
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,677
(I want to see Seok Jin penniless.)

816
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:05,313
- If you two are dating... - I'll add one more.

817
00:30:05,313 --> 00:30:06,414
If they date...

818
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:07,982
Seok Jin will be penniless.

819
00:30:07,982 --> 00:30:10,685
He wanted them to be in a relationship.

820
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,354
Seok Jin won't dress up as an impala.

821
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,423
I'll make him penniless instead.

822
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:18,226
(Seok Jin turns into a penniless man instead.)

823
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:21,596
Today's race to select the winner is called...

824
00:30:21,596 --> 00:30:24,566
The mission to win the TV rating notice is War of R Ddakji.

825
00:30:24,566 --> 00:30:27,368
(War of R Ddakji)

826
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:28,536
- "R Ddakiji"? - "R Ddakiji"?

827
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,671
Ddakji?

828
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,439
- I'm good at that game. - Why are we playing that?

829
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:34,576
The member with the most ddakjis will win the race...

830
00:30:34,576 --> 00:30:36,478
and become the director of the clip.

831
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:37,912
- I have to win this. - Everyone will be...

832
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:39,514
given 20 ddakjis to start.

833
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:41,216
Depending on the success of your mission,

834
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,785
you may be given more or forced to hand in your ddakjis.

835
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:46,154
- Let me hand them out first. - Okay.

836
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:48,123
- Look at this. - Give this to Se Chan.

837
00:30:48,123 --> 00:30:49,324
This is for Kwang Soo.

838
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:51,292
- There are names on them. - Our ddakjis are in here too.

839
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:53,128
Goodness, these are real ddakjis.

840
00:30:53,128 --> 00:30:54,829
My gosh. These used to come with snacks.

841
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,064
- These are the ones. - These are nice.

842
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,732
- Goodness. - These are nice.

843
00:30:57,932 --> 00:31:00,001
If there are any extras, can you give me some?

844
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:02,704
- These look amazing. - We wore a lot of costumes.

845
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:04,706
We did all sorts of things.

846
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,174
Seok Jin...

847
00:31:06,508 --> 00:31:07,909
must not have done much.

848
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:10,678
(But it seems Seok Jin must not have done much.)

849
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:12,347
You used only three pictures for the rest of his ddakjis...

850
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,716
while other members have about five photos.

851
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:15,917
Exactly.

852
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,119
- I don't think I can get married. - Did you do that?

853
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,854
I can't get married now.

854
00:31:19,854 --> 00:31:23,391
(This photo from last August will fend men off.)

855
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:24,626
Gosh, So Min.

856
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,927
Gosh, her photos are so funny.

857
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,829
(My goodness. Why did I do that?)

858
00:31:27,829 --> 00:31:30,431
I see. This is how I look like. Goodness.

859
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:31,766
Haha has the oddest one among us.

860
00:31:31,766 --> 00:31:33,401
- His ddakjis... - All of mine are weird.

861
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:37,272
This one. I really hate this one.

862
00:31:37,872 --> 00:31:39,874
- This photo. Seriously. - Haha.

863
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:42,043
Haha, you look like a loser.

864
00:31:42,043 --> 00:31:43,611
(Your face looks like a loser's.)

865
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,946
"A loser"?

866
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:47,649
(I respect his loser face.)

867
00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:48,850
Haha.

868
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,386
Now, I'll tell you the rules.

869
00:31:51,786 --> 00:31:53,221
The first mission is...

870
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:55,256
Battle of 12.

871
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:56,858
(The 1st mission is Battle of 12.)

872
00:31:56,858 --> 00:31:58,459
You will make 4 teams of 2.

873
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,795
Each team will invite guests who are related to the number, 12.

874
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:02,730
When you win the given challenge,

875
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,933
you will obtain R Ddakjis.

876
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,834
There are four keywords for guests you must invite.

877
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,404
You will make a team with the member who chose the same keyword.

878
00:32:09,504 --> 00:32:11,306
You will personally invite guests who fit the description.

879
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,341
The battle will 2 to 1.

880
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:16,511
The members who win the battle will earn 20 R Ddakjis.

881
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:19,080
We have to invite guests? We have to do that?

882
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:20,848
Before you begin your mission,

883
00:32:20,848 --> 00:32:23,785
let us reveal the keywords related to the number 12.

884
00:32:24,385 --> 00:32:26,187
- Should we all choose one? - Yes.

885
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:28,823
(2 members with the same keyword will make 1 team.)

886
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,592
(The partner they choose will play an important role today.)

887
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:32,827
Should I stay away from hardcore members like Kwang Soo?

888
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,229
- Is this the keyword? - Yes.

889
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:35,396
(The partner they choose will play an important role today.)

890
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,701
"A celebrity with a 12-year age gap"?

891
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:41,936
(Jae Seok and So Min are a team.)

892
00:32:41,936 --> 00:32:44,706
"A celebrity who was born in December".

893
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:47,242
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook are a team.)

894
00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:49,110
My gosh, mine is hard.

895
00:32:49,644 --> 00:32:51,713
(A celebrity who lives in the area at the 12th bus stop)

896
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:53,915
"Celebrity whose debut was 12 years ago".

897
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:56,818
(Kwang Soo and Haha are a team.)

898
00:32:56,818 --> 00:32:58,653
- It's going to be a long day. - Ji Hyo.

899
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,688
- Did you get the same one? - Goodness!

900
00:33:01,723 --> 00:33:04,692
- We played a similar one before. - Yes, we did.

901
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:07,061
- Seriously. - He introduced a wrong person.

902
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:08,129
(Kwang Soo was exhausted then.)

903
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:12,166
(Haha supposedly gave him the number for Yu Seung Woo, the singer.)

904
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,603
(Haha gave him the number to "help" Kwang Soo last April.)

905
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:20,241
(Kwang Soo went to meet Seung Woo with a leery feeling of gratitude.)

906
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:23,645
(However, "Lee" Seung Woo showed up.)

907
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:29,484
(This was how the Tricky and Cunning Brotherhood was forged.)

908
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,853
- He gave me a wrong number. - I gave him a different Seung Woo.

909
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:33,388
(The brotherhood is reunited. He's already feeling tired.)

910
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:35,089
I had to shave on that day too.

911
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:37,959
Everyone, you will move to your designated vehicle for each team.

912
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,661
You can continue your discussion there.

913
00:33:39,661 --> 00:33:41,062
All right.

914
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,399
(The mission for each team)

915
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,000
- So Min. - Yes, Jae Seok?

916
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,236
- I researched a while ago. - Yes?

917
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,071
A celebrity who is 12 years older than me is...

918
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:52,340
Lee Gyeong Gyu.

919
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:54,709
- I see. Lee Gyeong Gyu. - We have a 12-year age gap.

920
00:33:55,109 --> 00:33:57,779
Or another celebrity is Chon Ho Jin who won the Grand Award.

921
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:58,946
(He won the Grand Award from KBS.)

922
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:00,148
I have never met him in person.

923
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,317
- Really? - I've never had the pleasure.

924
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,352
I only met him in passing.

925
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:06,654
But I was never properly introduced to him.

926
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:09,457
- I've never worked with him before. - I'd like to meet him too.

927
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:11,526
How old is 12 years older than your age?

928
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:12,527
It's 35 years old.

929
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:13,861
(It's 35 years old.)

930
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,029
- That's 12 years older than you? - Yes.

931
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:16,030
(But she was born in 1986.)

932
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,266
- 35 is 12 years older than you? - Yes.

933
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,801
Wait, no. It's 45 years old.

934
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:21,102
- Don't you think that's too much. - I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

935
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:23,204
Do you think you're in high school today?

936
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:26,274
People who are 12 years younger than you are...

937
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:28,209
- 35 years old. - That's right.

938
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,477
People who are 12 years older than me are 45.

939
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:30,945
What year were they born?

940
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:33,848
(Who are some celebrities that are 12 years older than So Min?)

941
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:35,583
This celebrity is 45 years old.

942
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:37,118
(That's right!)

943
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:38,619
- That celebrity? - Yes.

944
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,121
- Isn't that celebrity busy? - Hold on.

945
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,523
- Do you have the number? - That celebrity's phone number...

946
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:43,891
is the only one I know among celebrities we mentioned so far.

947
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:46,427
(Jae Seok has ties with this popular celebrity?)

948
00:34:46,427 --> 00:34:48,296
(We are on our way to meet you now!)

949
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:49,731
First off, let's get moving.

950
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:51,899
We'll go to Gangnam Station first.

951
00:34:52,233 --> 00:34:53,368
First off,

952
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:56,337
- we'll give you two stickers. - Okay.

953
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,306
What are the stickers for?

954
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,175
Put one of the stickers on your body,

955
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,910
and think about whether you want to put the other sticker...

956
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,146
- on the guest or not. - We can put it anywhere?

957
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,714
Yes, you can put anywhere on the guest's body.

958
00:35:06,714 --> 00:35:08,683
I can think about this and put it on when I want to, correct?

959
00:35:08,683 --> 00:35:10,385
Whoever puts the sticker on the guest within five minutes...

960
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:11,519
will get to team up with the guest.

961
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,687
After finding out the mission,

962
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:14,188
if you believe teaming up with each other is better,

963
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:15,923
you don't have to put the sticker on the guest.

964
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:17,592
So Min, think about this then.

965
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:19,160
It might be better if we don't put this on the guest.

966
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,695
You and I can partner up and win the game.

967
00:35:21,462 --> 00:35:23,030
It's better to win 20 ddakjis.

968
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,133
But only first place matters.

969
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,434
(Winning them together doesn't do me any good.)

970
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,668
You have a point, but...

971
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:29,237
Then why don't you help me?

972
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,671
My plan is better than yours.

973
00:35:31,072 --> 00:35:33,241
I think...

974
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,442
Well,

975
00:35:34,609 --> 00:35:36,811
I really want to see you in the anchovy costume.

976
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:41,182
(I'm sorry. I really want to see you in the anchovy costume.)

977
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:42,517
Hey.

978
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:44,552
I also want to see you on the perch.

979
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:46,921
I want you to...

980
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:49,791
perch on that rod. Mark my words.

981
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,426
Small Jae Seok, Small Jae Seok.

982
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:54,529
(Her teasing is on repeat.)

983
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:56,964
My goodness, have you gone mad?

984
00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:59,567
Seriously. This isn't a double entendre.

985
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,169
- I have never... - But you do mean that.

986
00:36:01,169 --> 00:36:04,205
Anyway, stop trying to cause misunderstandings.

987
00:36:04,572 --> 00:36:06,641
Then I will make you a whale.

988
00:36:06,641 --> 00:36:07,842
Stop it!

989
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,610
Stop bringing that up.

990
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,679
This doesn't suit the program.

991
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,448
What are you talking about? You don't want to be an anchovy...

992
00:36:13,448 --> 00:36:15,016
- Just stop talking. - or a whale. What do you want?

993
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:16,751
Just drop this.

994
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:18,252
Then what will you be in the sea?

995
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:19,554
I told you to stop.

996
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:21,522
This is exactly why you cannot win this mission.

997
00:36:21,689 --> 00:36:22,924
Don't win today.

998
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:24,826
I'll win today. Unbelievable.

999
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:25,927
(Will her story come true?)

1000
00:36:26,127 --> 00:36:27,762
Well, I looked up celebrities...

1001
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:29,397
born in December.

1002
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,066
- There were so many. - Daniel was born in December.

1003
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,768
(He was born on December 10.)

1004
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,404
- Should I call Daniel? - I really like him.

1005
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,172
I love him too.

1006
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,174
- Psy was born in December too. - Psy?

1007
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:42,210
-Hey, Kye Sang was born in December. - Yes?

1008
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,078
- Kye Sang was born in December. - Hey!

1009
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,913
- Yoon Kye Sang. - Let's meet him.

1010
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,648
I watched "The Outlaws" like crazy.

1011
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:49,484
He was born in December.

1012
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,420
(The leading role in the hit move, "The Outlaws" last year)

1013
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,258
(Yoon Kye Sang played the role of his lifetime, Jang Chen.)

1014
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:59,494
Why don't you send him a text first?

1015
00:36:59,827 --> 00:37:02,330
- "Kye Sang, it's Seok Jin." - You want me to do it?

1016
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,664
No, I don't want to do it.

1017
00:37:03,698 --> 00:37:06,400
I have never met him in person though.

1018
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,468
- Seok Jin. - What?

1019
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:08,603
You won the Top Excellence Award.

1020
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,171
Regardless of my award,

1021
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:11,439
- I can't do this. - Right now,

1022
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,074
- you're the recipient of the award. - But still...

1023
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:15,543
- I freeze in front of famous stars. - Seok Jin.

1024
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,178
Come on. Give him a call. You said you'll do it.

1025
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:18,746
- I'll give you the number. Come on. - Let's give it a shot.

1026
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:21,649
He's not picking up.

1027
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:23,718
He might not answer an unknown number.

1028
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:29,290
- Hello? - Yes?

1029
00:37:29,824 --> 00:37:31,559
Is this Mr. Yoon Kye Sang?

1030
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,160
(He's careful.)

1031
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,762
- Yes, this is he. - Hey.

1032
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,898
(Kye Sang answers the phone!)

1033
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:38,065
He picked up.

1034
00:37:38,165 --> 00:37:39,867
- I'm sorry. - Kye Sang!

1035
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,636
This is Jee Seok Jin from Running Man.

1036
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:42,837
Oh, hello.

1037
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:44,539
- I'm sorry to call you like this. - Kye Sang.

1038
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:45,907
We called just in case, but you answered our call.

1039
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:47,608
I'm sorry, Kye Sang. This is Jong Kook.

1040
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:50,044
- Oh, hello. - Have you been well?

1041
00:37:50,912 --> 00:37:52,346
I'm sorry, Jang Chen.

1042
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:53,848
What are you doing now?

1043
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:55,349
I just finished working out.

1044
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:56,584
- I see. - Now, I'm on my way home.

1045
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:58,152
- Were you at the gym? - Yes.

1046
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:59,887
Well, you know...

1047
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,089
I feel so bad for asking you this.

1048
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:06,827
We have to meet with a celebrity who was born in December.

1049
00:38:07,295 --> 00:38:09,730
- I see. - Yes, but...

1050
00:38:11,098 --> 00:38:12,867
Don't feel like you have to say yes.

1051
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:14,235
It's probably not possible for us to meet...

1052
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,203
with you since you're not ready now, right?

1053
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,605
(Can we come meet you now?)

1054
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:24,679
(Will their spur-of-the-moment meeting be accomplished?)

1055
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:25,880
Right now, I'm naked though.

1056
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,049
- You're naked? My apologies. - I see.

1057
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:31,552
(He's naked since he has to take a shower after his workout.)

1058
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:32,820
I'm so sorry, Kye Sang.

1059
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,122
- I feel so bad. I'm really sorry. - So he is...

1060
00:38:35,156 --> 00:38:37,158
I'm sorry to ask you this, but...

1061
00:38:37,158 --> 00:38:38,593
can you say one of your famous lines?

1062
00:38:39,293 --> 00:38:41,696
(He has many famous lines that contributed to the film's success.)

1063
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,098
(Which one will he say?)

1064
00:38:44,966 --> 00:38:47,201
I came here to collect my money. Why should I care about that?

1065
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:49,937
(He sounds fierce.)

1066
00:38:49,937 --> 00:38:53,040
(Goodness! He perfectly reenacts the scene.)

1067
00:38:53,908 --> 00:38:56,477
I came here to collect my money. Why should I care about that?

1068
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,013
(He's true to his nickname, Kye Sang, the almighty!)

1069
00:38:59,013 --> 00:39:00,181
- Kye Sang. - But...

1070
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:01,649
Thank you so much for this.

1071
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:03,651
Sorry to point this out, but did you say the line naked?

1072
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:05,152
(Sorry to point this out, but did you say the line naked?)

1073
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:07,788
I bet people are looking at him in the locker room.

1074
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,190
You were about to take a shower.

1075
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,258
I apologize for asking you to do this,

1076
00:39:11,258 --> 00:39:13,828
but I'm sure your fans appreciate this.

1077
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:15,896
Happy New Year, Kye Sang. Thank you.

1078
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,064
- Happy New Year. - Sure, sure.

1079
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,633
- Thank you. - Bye.

1080
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:19,767
Bye.

1081
00:39:20,468 --> 00:39:21,535
Who can we meet?

1082
00:39:21,535 --> 00:39:23,304
- Celebrities born in December... - Seok Jin.

1083
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:25,539
The one I can think on top of my head is...

1084
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:26,641
He was born in December.

1085
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:28,009
It's Jang Hyuk.

1086
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:29,377
(Jang Hyuk, Jong Kook's best friend)

1087
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:31,145
- He was born in December. - Don't you talk to him regularly?

1088
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,547
- Yes, I do. We are close. - Right.

1089
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:35,950
- Let me give him a call. - Yes, call him.

1090
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,118
- Great. - He's filming a drama now.

1091
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:38,185
Right. That's true.

1092
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:40,788
So I have to see if he's available or not.

1093
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:41,956
- Let's give it a try. - Wait a second.

1094
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:45,726
- Hey, Jong Kook. - Hey, Hyuk.

1095
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:47,061
- Are you in a shoot now? - "Hey, Jong Kook."

1096
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:49,296
Yes, I'm waiting for my scene now.

1097
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:51,532
- Is that so? We are now... - I like him.

1098
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:55,369
- filming Running Man. - Yes? I see.

1099
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:58,839
Our mission is to find a celebrity who was born in December.

1100
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,141
- In December? - Yes.

1101
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:02,476
- So I was thinking if I could... - That's right.

1102
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:05,446
go visit you and film us playing a game.

1103
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:08,149
But it would be hard since you're filming a drama now, right?

1104
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:11,819
(I know you're filming now, but can you meet with us briefly?)

1105
00:40:11,819 --> 00:40:12,820
- If... - If you come here,

1106
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,789
I'm in no matter what. We have each other's back.

1107
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:15,790
Right.

1108
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,592
(If you come here, I'm in no matter what. We have each other's back.)

1109
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,028
- He's so cool. - Thank you so much, Hyuk.

1110
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:23,531
All right then. I'll see you there.

1111
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,499
By the way, what will I be doing?

1112
00:40:25,499 --> 00:40:28,602
(He's nervous.)

1113
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:31,839
We don't know yet.

1114
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,141
- We don't know either. - It's a game.

1115
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,177
Running Man makes me worried.

1116
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:38,012
It'll be okay.

1117
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:39,447
You don't have to worry.

1118
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:41,649
I'm supposed to be charismatic.

1119
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,250
(Please remember.)

1120
00:40:44,118 --> 00:40:46,587
(He's playing a charismatic lawyer.)

1121
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:47,722
I know that.

1122
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:49,156
We'll protect your charisma.

1123
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:50,357
All right.

1124
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,926
- Okay. - Okay.

1125
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:53,127
(They'll visit Hyuk in Songdo.)

1126
00:40:53,127 --> 00:40:55,763
I'll tell you what you need to do...

1127
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:57,832
- with Hyuk. - Now?

1128
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:59,233
- Now? - Right now?

1129
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:00,301
Okay.

1130
00:41:00,468 --> 00:41:02,036
Let's see. 1, 2, 3.

1131
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,639
"Blowing..."

1132
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:08,609
(Blow up 10 plastic bottles with your nose.)

1133
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:10,911
He has to blow up plastic bottles with his nose?

1134
00:41:13,214 --> 00:41:14,715
I'm sorry, Hyuk.

1135
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,183
I'm sorry.

1136
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,586
He said, "Running Man makes me worried."

1137
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:20,121
Gosh.

1138
00:41:20,121 --> 00:41:21,188
I'm so sorry.

1139
00:41:21,188 --> 00:41:22,456
Can't you give us another one?

1140
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:23,657
Didn't you hear him?

1141
00:41:23,657 --> 00:41:26,393
- Exactly. He was worried. - He's supposed to be charismatic.

1142
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,229
Let's do another one.

1143
00:41:28,229 --> 00:41:31,332
- Give us another one. - He can't do this.

1144
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,636
Let's go. Where's the bus stop? Do we have to go down?

1145
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:38,139
There's one there, and there's another one there.

1146
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:40,674
We have to go 12 stops.

1147
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:44,245
We'll go 12 stops and look for someone who lives there.

1148
00:41:44,311 --> 00:41:46,080
If we can't find anyone, we'll come back 12 stops...

1149
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,548
and find someone here.

1150
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:50,217
(They'll move 12 stops back.)

1151
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:51,552
- Here? - Yes.

1152
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:53,954
No one said we can't do that. We'll move 12 stops...

1153
00:41:53,954 --> 00:41:55,489
and look there first.

1154
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:59,026
- All right. Let's go wherever. - Let's go.

1155
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,195
We don't know which bus will come first.

1156
00:42:01,362 --> 00:42:03,931
- This one goes to Yeongdeungpo. - Yeongdeungpo?

1157
00:42:04,064 --> 00:42:06,300
This goes to Gayang-dong.

1158
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:08,402
Gayang-dong.

1159
00:42:08,402 --> 00:42:12,940
(It might become a long journey depending on the bus.)

1160
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:15,810
The first bus is arriving.

1161
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:17,444
- The color is... - It's blue.

1162
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:21,248
(They have to get on the bus and go 12 stops.)

1163
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,416
- It's bus number 602. - It's 602.

1164
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:25,386
(The bus they must ride is bus number 602.)

1165
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,054
- Let's get on the bus. - Let's go.

1166
00:42:27,054 --> 00:42:29,056
- Hello. - Hello.

1167
00:42:29,056 --> 00:42:30,090
(They get on the bus.)

1168
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,226
Hold on. We're...

1169
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:33,627
(They check the route.)

1170
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:34,962
Where are we now?

1171
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:38,666
(Which stop will they get off at?)

1172
00:42:40,334 --> 00:42:42,269
Chungjeongno Station.

1173
00:42:43,804 --> 00:42:47,942
(There are many newspaper companies and government offices.)

1174
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:49,376
Are there celebrities that come from this area?

1175
00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:51,879
(Will there be any celebrities around there?)

1176
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:53,314
There's none.

1177
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:56,150
Let's go there first. If I remember correctly,

1178
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:59,353
there are many media companies around there.

1179
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,423
We might find some celebrities.

1180
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:05,326
I used to come to Sinchon a lot.

1181
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:06,694
We're passing by Sinchon.

1182
00:43:06,694 --> 00:43:09,296
When I was younger,

1183
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:13,000
- this place was so popular. - It was.

1184
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,769
I even received a few casting offers in this area.

1185
00:43:16,003 --> 00:43:18,072
I got some business cards.

1186
00:43:18,072 --> 00:43:20,174
(The legendary street casting)

1187
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:21,242
Really?

1188
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:23,244
Did you debut after getting business cards?

1189
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:24,645
I did.

1190
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:26,780
- Really? - Yes.

1191
00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:32,319
(Ji Hyo used to receive a lot of business cards.)

1192
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:36,490
I can't believe I'm with a person who debuted after getting a card.

1193
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:39,693
It's true. I debuted after getting a business card.

1194
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:42,830
- This brings back memories. - It's nice.

1195
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:44,698
Ewha Womans University is nice too. It would've been great...

1196
00:43:44,698 --> 00:43:45,799
- to come here. - You're right.

1197
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,902
(Meanwhile)

1198
00:43:47,902 --> 00:43:51,472
I have an exhausting partner today.

1199
00:43:51,472 --> 00:43:53,641
I wanted to take it easy today.

1200
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:55,776
- Gosh, today is... - Goodness.

1201
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:00,147
I really wanted to do well in today's game.

1202
00:44:00,147 --> 00:44:01,949
It's going to be ugly.

1203
00:44:01,949 --> 00:44:03,817
- Let's not do that again. - Seriously.

1204
00:44:03,817 --> 00:44:05,352
- Let's play fair. - Don't get cute.

1205
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:08,222
- Don't be too mean. - It depends on you.

1206
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:10,791
Let's not even start it.

1207
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:11,959
Let's play fair.

1208
00:44:11,959 --> 00:44:13,761
- It's a promise. - Seriously.

1209
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:15,529
Let's show them what fair play is.

1210
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,631
We learned everything from you.

1211
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:20,367
(Haha is the legendary betrayer.)

1212
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,069
Who do you think we learned it from?

1213
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,440
You learned it too well.

1214
00:44:27,241 --> 00:44:30,210
- Learn only good things. - You amaze me.

1215
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,845
(Teacher versus student)

1216
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:34,148
- It's true. - You're unbelievable.

1217
00:44:35,182 --> 00:44:37,785
We have to choose the right partner.

1218
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:40,120
- Someone who debuted 12 years ago. - 12 years.

1219
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:42,556
Someone who debuted 12 years ago...

1220
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:46,327
Let's do this. Let's start over.

1221
00:44:46,327 --> 00:44:47,962
You and me...

1222
00:44:47,962 --> 00:44:50,464
I really want to win.

1223
00:44:50,497 --> 00:44:51,865
I love my scenario.

1224
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:54,868
- Haha. - Yes?

1225
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:57,671
If I win, I'll take out your water bomb.

1226
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:00,040
(If I win, I'll take out your water bomb.)

1227
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,408
(Tempting)

1228
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:03,444
Kwang Soo usually...

1229
00:45:03,444 --> 00:45:05,612
- keeps his promises. - I promise.

1230
00:45:05,946 --> 00:45:07,047
I'll take yours out.

1231
00:45:07,047 --> 00:45:08,115
(Trust me.)

1232
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:11,452
When I say, "Running Man is for 12 and over..."

1233
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:12,886
"12 and over".

1234
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,788
- Can I say, "and over"? - You can say, "12".

1235
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:16,824
(You can say, "12".)

1236
00:45:16,824 --> 00:45:17,958
12?

1237
00:45:18,225 --> 00:45:20,160
Okay.

1238
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,862
- Keep your promise. - "Running Man is for..."

1239
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:24,798
- "12..." - "and over."

1240
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,434
Can I say something else?

1241
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:29,470
It sounds weird.

1242
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,804
(It doesn't sound nice.)

1243
00:45:30,804 --> 00:45:31,872
All right.

1244
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:34,274
- You can say, "for 12 and over". - Okay.

1245
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:36,677
- "Running Man is..." - "For 12 and over."

1246
00:45:36,677 --> 00:45:39,513
(Running Man is for 12 and over.)

1247
00:45:39,513 --> 00:45:41,248
It doesn't sound right.

1248
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,583
That part is too important.

1249
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,485
You start.

1250
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:47,321
- "Running Man is..." - "For 12 and over."

1251
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:49,390
- Like this? - It was nice.

1252
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,025
- I'll keep my promise. - Thank you.

1253
00:45:51,225 --> 00:45:52,826
I'll remove your water bomb.

1254
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:56,463
I found Lee Sang Yeob.

1255
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,898
He was on Running Man recently, right?

1256
00:45:57,898 --> 00:46:00,968
He debuted in 2007.

1257
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,403
Really?

1258
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:03,504
(This is his 12th year.)

1259
00:46:04,671 --> 00:46:10,110
(He recently did funny impressions on Running Man.)

1260
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:14,281
It's not a bad idea, is it? He even won an award recently.

1261
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:15,849
That's right.

1262
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,785
We should call him and congratulate him.

1263
00:46:20,287 --> 00:46:21,688
It's Sang Yeob.

1264
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:23,490
Hello.

1265
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,525
(He's curt.)

1266
00:46:24,525 --> 00:46:26,660
Hello, this is Running Man. We're Haha...

1267
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,795
And Kwang Soo.

1268
00:46:27,795 --> 00:46:30,964
- Hi, Sang Yeob. - Hello.

1269
00:46:30,964 --> 00:46:32,466
- Hello. - Hi.

1270
00:46:32,466 --> 00:46:34,468
(Gentle)

1271
00:46:34,468 --> 00:46:35,769
Hi. It's nice to speak to you.

1272
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,704
His voice changed instantly.

1273
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:40,274
- Nice to hear from you. - It gave me goosebumps.

1274
00:46:40,274 --> 00:46:42,309
What's your blood type?

1275
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:43,710
(Random)

1276
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,746
(Why is he asking that question?)

1277
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,348
It's B.

1278
00:46:48,582 --> 00:46:51,385
- That's right. You were chosen... - Yes.

1279
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:55,722
as the blood-type B star of 2017.

1280
00:46:55,722 --> 00:46:56,890
Wait.

1281
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:58,992
(The blood-type B star of 2017?)

1282
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:01,495
(What?)

1283
00:47:01,495 --> 00:47:02,729
Congratulations...

1284
00:47:03,464 --> 00:47:05,666
- on getting chosen. - on getting chosen.

1285
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:06,900
(Congratulations)

1286
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:09,570
Congratulations.

1287
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,339
The competition was fierce among blood-type B stars.

1288
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:14,041
- Really? - You got second place,

1289
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:15,676
and Jae Seok got third place.

1290
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:18,946
(Both of them are telling lies so skillfully.)

1291
00:47:19,847 --> 00:47:21,281
Are you shooting right now?

1292
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:23,283
- We are. - You are?

1293
00:47:23,283 --> 00:47:26,587
We're visiting our favorite guests.

1294
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:29,623
And you were chosen as the star of 2017.

1295
00:47:29,623 --> 00:47:32,559
We have a prize for you.

1296
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,628
(We have a prize for you.)

1297
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:35,929
- Do you have time? - I can come to you.

1298
00:47:36,163 --> 00:47:38,332
- Is that okay? - Should we meet halfway?

1299
00:47:38,398 --> 00:47:40,000
Should we do that?

1300
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,436
We'll be having tteokbokki in Hongdae. Can you come there?

1301
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:45,139
- All right. - You have to hurry.

1302
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:46,874
- Okay. - It's my treat.

1303
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:49,376
We even have a trophy.

1304
00:47:50,544 --> 00:47:53,180
(They're even lying about a trophy.)

1305
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,682
- Anyway, I'll see you there. - Okay.

1306
00:47:55,682 --> 00:47:57,618
- See you there. - But...

1307
00:47:57,618 --> 00:47:59,453
you have to hurry.

1308
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:02,356
- Okay. - Thank you. I love you.

1309
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:04,291
See you soon. Bye.

1310
00:48:06,894 --> 00:48:08,962
Don't ever do this to me.

1311
00:48:08,962 --> 00:48:10,497
- Let me explain. - Don't do this to me.

1312
00:48:10,497 --> 00:48:11,865
It's because of you.

1313
00:48:11,865 --> 00:48:14,034
- You played along so well. - Don't do this to me.

1314
00:48:14,034 --> 00:48:16,403
- I couldn't stop lying. - Haha is scary.

1315
00:48:16,403 --> 00:48:17,971
If our careers fail,

1316
00:48:17,971 --> 00:48:19,706
- we could con someone together. - Let's do that.

1317
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:20,807
Let's con Seok Jin.

1318
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,242
- We have to. - Okay.

1319
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:23,443
How are we going to make a trophy?

1320
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:24,878
(How are we going to keep our promise?)

1321
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:28,315
Let me tell you what the game is about.

1322
00:48:28,315 --> 00:48:30,884
(The game is revealed.)

1323
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:36,456
"Three Choices".

1324
00:48:36,456 --> 00:48:38,759
"You'll make three choices at a cafe."

1325
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:40,694
"If you make the same choice, you succeed."

1326
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:44,498
"The team that succeeds twice first will win."

1327
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:45,999
- What does that mean? - I don't understand.

1328
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:48,168
If we're choosing, it means that this is a roulette.

1329
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,772
Yes. We'll explain the details later.

1330
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:53,440
The team that wins two points first will win.

1331
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,677
You'll compete 2 to 1, so your victory lies with your partner.

1332
00:48:56,877 --> 00:49:01,081
That means you have a better chance if you're two people.

1333
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:05,652
(It's better to have a guest.)

1334
00:49:06,386 --> 00:49:07,487
(Look at him.)

1335
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:08,555
Hey.

1336
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:11,225
- I can't do this with you. - What?

1337
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:12,926
Don't do that.

1338
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:14,628
Your face says everything.

1339
00:49:14,761 --> 00:49:18,799
Please explain the situation with the subtitles.

1340
00:49:18,799 --> 00:49:20,701
- Who made it more obvious? - Haha.

1341
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,470
Let's stick together. There are many games left.

1342
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,538
(Don't betray me.)

1343
00:49:24,538 --> 00:49:26,206
I never said I wouldn't.

1344
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:28,008
Let's stick together.

1345
00:49:28,141 --> 00:49:31,078
(Thinking)

1346
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:32,679
- Look at him. - Let's take it easy.

1347
00:49:32,679 --> 00:49:34,581
- Let's play fair. - Seriously.

1348
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:35,983
I'm already tired.

1349
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:38,185
(He wants us to stick together?)

1350
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,486
Hey, give it to me.

1351
00:49:39,486 --> 00:49:41,855
(Give your sticker to me.)

1352
00:49:41,855 --> 00:49:43,090
You don't need it anyway.

1353
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,291
Can we choose one another?

1354
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,693
- Yes. - It's between us.

1355
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:47,928
- Let's exchange the stickers. - Sure.

1356
00:49:47,928 --> 00:49:49,396
Do we really need to do this?

1357
00:49:50,063 --> 00:49:52,199
- What? - It's like you don't trust me.

1358
00:49:53,467 --> 00:49:55,135
- I do. - I...

1359
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,404
Why wouldn't I trust you?

1360
00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:00,240
- You lost it? - Where is it?

1361
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,608
(You lost it?)

1362
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:02,676
It was here before.

1363
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:05,245
(Your sticker suddenly disappeared?)

1364
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:07,014
Can you give me one more?

1365
00:50:08,282 --> 00:50:09,416
Hey.

1366
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,351
(Forget it.)

1367
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:14,321
What's with him? He's tiring me out.

1368
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:17,057
Fine, let's go our separate ways.

1369
00:50:18,625 --> 00:50:19,926
- You're... - Haha.

1370
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:21,795
- That's not it. - You're...

1371
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,097
That's not why. Let's exchange.

1372
00:50:24,097 --> 00:50:25,966
- What's wrong with you? - Let's exchange.

1373
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:28,402
I didn't know it was here. Let's exchange.

1374
00:50:28,402 --> 00:50:29,870
- Just do it. - I'm angry,

1375
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,438
so I'll keep all.

1376
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:32,906
(They're sneaky traitors.)

1377
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:34,041
Wait a minute.

1378
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:35,976
- What do you mean? - Let me keep them.

1379
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:37,277
Don't you trust me?

1380
00:50:37,477 --> 00:50:39,346
I think I'm angry at you.

1381
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:40,947
Don't talk to me for a while.

1382
00:50:42,816 --> 00:50:45,218
Come on, Haha. Fine.

1383
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:48,322
(Team Jae Seok and So Min)

1384
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:50,324
Here's the mission.

1385
00:50:50,324 --> 00:50:51,391
What is it?

1386
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:53,393
Your mission is called...

1387
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,796
Karaoke of 12.

1388
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:57,030
- Karaoke? - What's that?

1389
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:59,499
You'll take turns singing.

1390
00:50:59,499 --> 00:51:01,968
The person with the higher score wins.

1391
00:51:02,235 --> 00:51:05,105
The winner will get 20 ddakjis.

1392
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:12,145
(They exchange a look of competitiveness.)

1393
00:51:13,714 --> 00:51:16,283
Jae Seok, let's sing together.

1394
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:17,451
You don't sing well.

1395
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:18,652
I sing well.

1396
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:19,753
What can you sing?

1397
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,458
I sang with Kim Dong Wan in the past.

1398
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,594
- Kim Dong Wan? - Kim Dong Wan of Shinhwa.

1399
00:51:27,661 --> 00:51:28,762
- Dong Wan? - Yes.

1400
00:51:28,762 --> 00:51:29,930
Sing the song.

1401
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,567
It's been a long time, so I forgot, but I added harmony.

1402
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,902
- No way. - Look it up.

1403
00:51:35,902 --> 00:51:37,904
You'll find it on the internet.

1404
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:39,473
- Really? - Yes.

1405
00:51:39,539 --> 00:51:41,108
- Did you sing with him? - Yes.

1406
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,477
I trained to be a singer in high school.

1407
00:51:44,277 --> 00:51:45,612
- But I was a faceless singer. - Really?

1408
00:51:45,612 --> 00:51:47,247
(She was a faceless singer.)

1409
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:50,517
- It was popular back then. - "Faceless singer"?

1410
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:54,821
The producer told me to stay as a faceless singer...

1411
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:57,457
and an actress, and then to reveal my identity later.

1412
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:58,959
I worked with him,

1413
00:51:59,426 --> 00:52:03,463
but the producer ran away to Japan because I had no talent.

1414
00:52:04,464 --> 00:52:07,334
Your relationships always end that way.

1415
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:09,803
It's the other person who runs away.

1416
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:11,338
I was quite surprised.

1417
00:52:11,338 --> 00:52:12,739
- There it is. - Right?

1418
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,608
(He presses play.)

1419
00:52:15,008 --> 00:52:16,343
That's my voice.

1420
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:17,778
Which part?

1421
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:20,046
(She hums.)

1422
00:52:20,046 --> 00:52:21,114
The female voice.

1423
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:24,651
Do you hear the harmony?

1424
00:52:29,456 --> 00:52:32,025
When will your part start?

1425
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,093
This is my part.

1426
00:52:35,362 --> 00:52:39,733
(It's been a long time)

1427
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:43,703
(I feel free at this moment)

1428
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:44,704
That's me.

1429
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:47,541
(For those who may be flustered...)

1430
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:53,213
("He Starlight" by Kim Dong Wan featuring Jeon So Min)

1431
00:52:53,447 --> 00:52:54,581
My part starts again.

1432
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:56,950
Listen closely.

1433
00:52:57,117 --> 00:53:00,220
(The times when I walked alone)

1434
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:01,288
It's me.

1435
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,990
(Aren't I a good singer?)

1436
00:53:04,057 --> 00:53:06,359
Did you add the harmony?

1437
00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:07,461
Sing it again.

1438
00:53:08,094 --> 00:53:11,665
The times when I walked alone

1439
00:53:11,665 --> 00:53:12,732
(He hits her.)

1440
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,735
(Stop playing around)

1441
00:53:16,536 --> 00:53:20,140
That's so fake.

1442
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,242
There's no sincerity in your voice.

1443
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:23,310
(She lacks sincerity.)

1444
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,345
- Do you know what? - What?

1445
00:53:25,345 --> 00:53:30,083
It's a song called "Doll" by Shin Hye Sung and Lee Jee Hoon.

1446
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,486
- Yes. - It's the epitome of harmony.

1447
00:53:32,486 --> 00:53:34,521
People sing it at the karaoke.

1448
00:53:34,521 --> 00:53:37,290
Will you add harmony while I sing it?

1449
00:53:37,424 --> 00:53:38,892
Do I have to?

1450
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:42,229
(So Min considers it the epitome of harmony.)

1451
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:45,866
(Will So Min and Jae Seok sing such a sweet song?)

1452
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,802
I'll miss you

1453
00:53:48,802 --> 00:53:52,372
It cannot be helped

1454
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:54,674
(Here's my high note.)

1455
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:58,912
When I'm exhausted from crying for so long

1456
00:53:58,912 --> 00:54:01,448
I'll look for you

1457
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:03,517
(She gives up.)

1458
00:54:03,517 --> 00:54:04,918
When will you sing in harmony?

1459
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:06,319
You sing horribly.

1460
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:09,623
I'm singing in low pitch for the background bass.

1461
00:54:09,623 --> 00:54:11,858
I can sing "Spring" in harmony very well.

1462
00:54:11,858 --> 00:54:14,694
Can you sing it? I'm good at singing it in harmony.

1463
00:54:14,694 --> 00:54:15,996
Really? I'll try again.

1464
00:54:15,996 --> 00:54:17,130
Start.

1465
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,665
In deep mountains

1466
00:54:18,665 --> 00:54:20,133
- Stop it. - There's a spring

1467
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:22,102
- That's not in harmony. - Who drinks from there?

1468
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:23,703
Stop it.

1469
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,472
Stop it already.

1470
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:27,374
Stop it. Goodness.

1471
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:28,875
That's enough.

1472
00:54:28,875 --> 00:54:30,443
- Stop singing. - It's harmony.

1473
00:54:30,443 --> 00:54:32,946
- Jae Seok. - Just stop it.

1474
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:33,947
Try it again.

1475
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:36,716
I'll sing in harmony instead. This is how you do it.

1476
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:40,020
You sing like this to add harmony.

1477
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,688
Start.

1478
00:54:42,188 --> 00:54:46,026
In deep mountains, there's a spring

1479
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,929
Who drinks from there?

1480
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:52,933
(They sing harmoniously as they play with notes.)

1481
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:54,901
Destroying eyes

1482
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:56,870
Those are not the lyrics.

1483
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,471
(What did you say?)

1484
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:02,309
(Something seems terribly wrong.)

1485
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:04,110
What are you singing?

1486
00:55:04,277 --> 00:55:06,613
What kind of lyrics are those?

1487
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,048
What are you?

1488
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,883
(They arrive in Gangnam.)

1489
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,652
What are some other songs?

1490
00:55:12,652 --> 00:55:14,220
(They select songs while waiting.)

1491
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,889
I should sing "Darling".

1492
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,958
That's a good one.

1493
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,025
(Knocking)

1494
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:22,462
(The guest is 45 years old.)

1495
00:55:24,864 --> 00:55:29,135
(It's a star who will shine this year.)

1496
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:32,172
(He also has amazing singing skills.)

1497
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:37,978
(Who is today's special guest who has it all?)

1498
00:55:38,979 --> 00:55:40,246
That's a good one.

1499
00:55:40,246 --> 00:55:41,314
(Knocking)

1500
00:55:41,314 --> 00:55:44,751
(The guest is 45 years old.)

1501
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:51,424
(It's a star who will shine this year.)

1502
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:54,461
(He also has amazing singing skills.)

1503
00:55:54,461 --> 00:56:00,266
(Who is today's special guest who has it all?)

1504
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:03,570
Young Chul.

1505
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:06,772
The one who will...

1506
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:10,343
shine in 2018 is me.

1507
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,213
(The most popular comedian singer, Kim Young Chul)

1508
00:56:13,213 --> 00:56:14,781
- Hello, Young Chul. - Come here.

1509
00:56:14,781 --> 00:56:17,217
Did you bring an English newspaper on purpose?

1510
00:56:17,283 --> 00:56:19,252
I always read the newspaper.

1511
00:56:19,252 --> 00:56:20,320
It's in English.

1512
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:24,024
- I always read the news. - Where did you get it?

1513
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:25,458
There's an English newspaper in his bag.

1514
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,788
Stop it.

1515
00:56:26,893 --> 00:56:28,561
There's his wallet too.

1516
00:56:28,895 --> 00:56:30,463
He has so much cash.

1517
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:32,198
Stop it. He just arrived.

1518
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:33,933
You take out his wallet as soon as he arrives.

1519
00:56:33,933 --> 00:56:36,403
- Is that her habit? - No.

1520
00:56:36,403 --> 00:56:38,171
Put the newspaper back in.

1521
00:56:38,171 --> 00:56:39,939
Thank you, Young Chul.

1522
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,042
I was really surprised.

1523
00:56:42,042 --> 00:56:43,143
Why?

1524
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:45,779
This is why I thought you called me.

1525
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:46,846
What?

1526
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:49,516
Did you hear what happened at the Entertainment Awards Ceremony?

1527
00:56:49,516 --> 00:56:51,584
- What? - Am I regular?

1528
00:56:51,718 --> 00:56:54,387
(She sticks a team sticker.)

1529
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:57,190
What does R mean?

1530
00:56:57,424 --> 00:56:59,826
Does it stand for regular?

1531
00:57:00,126 --> 00:57:02,162
- Did I become a regular member? - What did you do?

1532
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:04,931
- Am I a regular member now? - What did you do?

1533
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:06,366
Are you selecting another member?

1534
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:09,202
So Min and Young Chul will be a team.

1535
00:57:09,202 --> 00:57:10,203
(So Min and Young Chul versus Jae Seok)

1536
00:57:10,203 --> 00:57:13,440
Jae Seok will be on his own.

1537
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,442
- Did you do something wrong? - So Min.

1538
00:57:15,442 --> 00:57:16,576
(Just wait, and see.)

1539
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:18,712
(Their singing competition starts.)

1540
00:57:18,712 --> 00:57:21,715
All I have to do is score higher.

1541
00:57:21,715 --> 00:57:22,782
(So Min and Young Chul's average score versus Jae Seok's score)

1542
00:57:24,718 --> 00:57:26,252
(She clicks her tongue.)

1543
00:57:26,252 --> 00:57:28,254
Hello. 1, 2.

1544
00:57:28,321 --> 00:57:32,025
Microphone testing, 1, 2, thank you.

1545
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:35,195
What did you say?

1546
00:57:35,929 --> 00:57:38,865
(She prepares a lot for her bad singing skills.)

1547
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:40,900
Is this a warm-up?

1548
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:41,901
(They warm up first.)

1549
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:42,902
Go.

1550
00:57:42,902 --> 00:57:46,573
("Ring" has an unforgettable melody.)

1551
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,744
(He exaggerates his dance moves from the start.)

1552
00:57:56,449 --> 00:57:58,051
(Excited)

1553
00:57:58,418 --> 00:58:01,488
(It's a crazy dance.)

1554
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:06,059
So Min.

1555
00:58:06,426 --> 00:58:07,560
(She turns.)

1556
00:58:08,595 --> 00:58:09,729
What was that?

1557
00:58:10,897 --> 00:58:12,665
(She pokes.)

1558
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:13,933
(She does a finish.)

1559
00:58:15,135 --> 00:58:18,071
(Jae Seok loves this type of dance.)

1560
00:58:19,105 --> 00:58:21,407
(They remember the steps.)

1561
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:24,144
I can also make a whirlwind.

1562
00:58:24,878 --> 00:58:26,079
(She spins.)

1563
00:58:26,146 --> 00:58:27,280
It's a whirlwind.

1564
00:58:27,847 --> 00:58:30,784
(It's So Min's whirlwind dance.)

1565
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,087
Gosh, I'm dizzy.

1566
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,089
(What is Young Chul score?)

1567
00:58:36,089 --> 00:58:37,423
- It's 100. - I never sang it at a karaoke.

1568
00:58:37,423 --> 00:58:38,792
- You got 100. - It's 100.

1569
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:41,194
- So Min's dance was good. - Isn't it charming?

1570
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:42,495
(More than Young Chul's singing...)

1571
00:58:42,495 --> 00:58:45,165
- 1, 2. - You have to move forward.

1572
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:46,766
You can also do it this way.

1573
00:58:48,835 --> 00:58:50,069
You can also do it this way.

1574
00:58:50,537 --> 00:58:53,773
(She mimics various creatures.)

1575
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:55,141
(I'll practice that dance.)

1576
00:58:55,275 --> 00:58:56,409
Let's see.

1577
00:58:56,409 --> 00:58:57,410
Does the competition start?

1578
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,345
Yes, we'll each sing a song.

1579
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:01,848
We'll take the average of your scores...

1580
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:03,183
and compare it to mine.

1581
00:59:03,183 --> 00:59:04,484
I'm nervous.

1582
00:59:04,651 --> 00:59:06,319
Young Chul scored high.

1583
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:07,387
"Ring".

1584
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:08,988
(She gets energy from Young Chul.)

1585
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:11,191
- Are we starting? - Yes.

1586
00:59:11,357 --> 00:59:13,693
She'll start. Singing in Jin Young's version is good.

1587
00:59:13,693 --> 00:59:15,628
(The winner gets 20 ddakjis.)

1588
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:19,065
(How much will So Min score?)

1589
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,568
So Min.

1590
00:59:21,568 --> 00:59:22,669
(She transforms.)

1591
00:59:24,137 --> 00:59:25,371
(Ring)

1592
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:29,642
(He gets up.)

1593
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:32,312
(The old men can't resist dancing.)

1594
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:37,317
(Her singing is rather stable in the beginning.)

1595
00:59:38,484 --> 00:59:40,887
(I'm your older sister)

1596
00:59:42,255 --> 00:59:46,059
(She reaches the climax as she sings passionately.)

1597
00:59:48,528 --> 00:59:50,663
(Get ready.)

1598
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:52,365
(Ring)

1599
00:59:53,132 --> 00:59:55,068
(They waited for this part.)

1600
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:56,970
Let's go

1601
00:59:57,537 --> 00:59:59,205
(Spinning)

1602
00:59:59,205 --> 01:00:02,609
(She's out of breath.)

1603
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:04,611
(They're out of breath,)

1604
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:07,347
(but they can't stop dancing.)

1605
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,184
(The past 4 minutes felt like 4 hours.)

1606
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:13,253
(It's time to reveal the score.)

1607
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:14,888
- What is her score? - Please.

1608
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:16,322
(Panting)

1609
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:19,259
(From the middle, she gave up on singing and focused on dancing.)

1610
01:00:19,692 --> 01:00:20,894
What is my score?

1611
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:22,795
85. It's 85.

1612
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:25,632
(Compared to her singing skill, 85 percent is generous.)

1613
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:27,634
85. It's 85.

1614
01:00:28,868 --> 01:00:30,169
- 85 percent? - Is that good?

1615
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:32,438
- Is it not bad? - We needed to get over 90.

1616
01:00:32,438 --> 01:00:35,008
(Jae Seok and Young Chul are left. What will they get?)

1617
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:36,976
- Here? - Please have a seat.

1618
01:00:36,976 --> 01:00:38,244
(Haha and Kwang Soo are going to meet Sang Yeob.)

1619
01:00:38,244 --> 01:00:39,879
Let's make a paper award.

1620
01:00:41,414 --> 01:00:43,783
(They make a paper award from a blank paper.)

1621
01:00:43,783 --> 01:00:45,084
Do you want to make it?

1622
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:47,020
- Do you want to draw? I'll make it. - Okay.

1623
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:53,393
(It's a Blood Type B Star Award, so they are very sincere.)

1624
01:00:53,393 --> 01:00:55,295
You can do it comfortably.

1625
01:00:57,463 --> 01:01:01,567
(He's creating a prestigious-looking trophy from the drama awards.)

1626
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,969
This is so sloppy.

1627
01:01:04,804 --> 01:01:07,573
(Award ceremonies are about the sincerity, not the awards.)

1628
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:10,009
- It's all about the heart. - I know.

1629
01:01:10,576 --> 01:01:12,045
But that's really bad.

1630
01:01:12,612 --> 01:01:15,548
Look at yours.

1631
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:17,350
I have no time. I'm almost done.

1632
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,486
(It's entirely handmade.)

1633
01:01:20,486 --> 01:01:21,654
I'm almost done.

1634
01:01:22,655 --> 01:01:25,325
This is really bad.

1635
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,529
Doesn't it look pretty nice?

1636
01:01:29,896 --> 01:01:32,832
(It's a water bottle trophy.)

1637
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:34,267
It's pretty good.

1638
01:01:35,868 --> 01:01:37,303
(He gets up.)

1639
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:39,105
Isn't this nice?

1640
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,708
It is, right?

1641
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:43,776
Blood Type B Star Award.

1642
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:46,212
(This award is presented for your talent and wit on Running Man.)

1643
01:01:47,113 --> 01:01:48,381
Haha.

1644
01:01:48,514 --> 01:01:50,350
That looks good.

1645
01:01:50,783 --> 01:01:52,685
- He might cry. - Right?

1646
01:01:52,685 --> 01:01:54,120
(It's a more prestigious-looking trophy decorated with a wreath.)

1647
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:55,254
Put on a sticker.

1648
01:01:56,556 --> 01:01:58,925
(Sang Yeob will be happy, right?)

1649
01:02:00,727 --> 01:02:03,229
This came off.

1650
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,466
(Let's see.)

1651
01:02:06,466 --> 01:02:08,501
Hold on.

1652
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:10,703
Hold on.

1653
01:02:11,304 --> 01:02:13,373
- When did it come off? - I'm missing this.

1654
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,074
Am I not supposed to have it on me?

1655
01:02:15,074 --> 01:02:16,442
Come on.

1656
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:17,643
(We're both experts. Why are you doing this?)

1657
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:19,512
- Don't do this. - It really came off.

1658
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:21,781
Do I not need it? If not...

1659
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:23,983
He's a bit strange.

1660
01:02:24,884 --> 01:02:26,185
Get up.

1661
01:02:26,419 --> 01:02:27,954
I'm serious.

1662
01:02:27,954 --> 01:02:29,088
I don't have it.

1663
01:02:30,757 --> 01:02:32,125
I'm serious. I don't have it.

1664
01:02:32,592 --> 01:02:34,193
If you don't have it,

1665
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:36,763
you need another one...

1666
01:02:36,763 --> 01:02:38,164
to be on the same team as other people with the same color.

1667
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:40,066
It's his fault that he lost it.

1668
01:02:40,233 --> 01:02:41,367
(Where is it?)

1669
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:42,568
Are you going to put it on?

1670
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:46,806
It must be here somewhere. Where is it?

1671
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:48,341
(It must be here. Where is it?)

1672
01:02:49,909 --> 01:02:52,345
Come here.

1673
01:02:52,345 --> 01:02:53,479
I really don't have it.

1674
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,514
You punk.

1675
01:02:54,514 --> 01:02:56,315
(He discovers the trick.)

1676
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:57,450
Do you want to die?

1677
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,618
I don't have it.

1678
01:02:58,885 --> 01:03:00,987
(Do you want to die?)

1679
01:03:00,987 --> 01:03:02,855
- What's that? There it is. - My gosh.

1680
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:05,024
Goodness.

1681
01:03:05,024 --> 01:03:06,492
- Do you think I did it? - Never mind.

1682
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:07,627
Don't talk.

1683
01:03:07,627 --> 01:03:09,729
- It fell, so I sat on it. - It's okay.

1684
01:03:09,729 --> 01:03:11,130
- Haha. - I'm not talking to him.

1685
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:13,599
- You're mistaken. I sat on it. - I won't talk to him.

1686
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,234
I didn't know I sat on it.

1687
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:17,203
You...

1688
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:18,704
I'm truly innocent.

1689
01:03:18,805 --> 01:03:20,973
You are...

1690
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:22,642
(Goodness)

1691
01:03:22,642 --> 01:03:24,777
You are such a weird guy.

1692
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:26,345
Aren't you going to give me your sticker?

1693
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:28,514
(You promised.)

1694
01:03:29,615 --> 01:03:31,184
Why would I give you mine?

1695
01:03:31,651 --> 01:03:34,487
He's here. Sang Yeob is here.

1696
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,356
- Hello. - Welcome.

1697
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:39,225
- Hello. - Congratulations.

1698
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:41,761
Congratulations.

1699
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:45,965
(Congratulations, Sang Yeob.)

1700
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,402
(What is going on?)

1701
01:03:49,402 --> 01:03:50,570
"Congratulations."

1702
01:03:51,104 --> 01:03:53,372
"Blood Type B Star Award".

1703
01:03:53,673 --> 01:03:55,408
"Best Top Three".

1704
01:03:55,741 --> 01:03:57,443
"Lee Sang Yeob".

1705
01:03:57,743 --> 01:03:59,779
"This award is presented..."

1706
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:01,814
"for your talent and wit on Running Man".

1707
01:04:01,814 --> 01:04:04,150
"From members of Running Man, 2018".

1708
01:04:04,617 --> 01:04:08,821
(Singing)

1709
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,256
Let's take a picture.

1710
01:04:11,924 --> 01:04:13,059
(The tricksters get into position for a picture.)

1711
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:14,160
Turn.

1712
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,394
(The tricksters get into position for a picture.)

1713
01:04:15,394 --> 01:04:16,562
Long time, no see.

1714
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:23,569
(They try to take Sang Yeob away.)

1715
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:24,804
I stuck it on him!

1716
01:04:25,071 --> 01:04:26,873
(He sticks the team sticker.)

1717
01:04:27,006 --> 01:04:29,142
(Kwang Soo's sticker)

1718
01:04:29,475 --> 01:04:31,244
I stuck it on him. I did it first.

1719
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,678
Haha...

1720
01:04:33,246 --> 01:04:34,947
Haha did something.

1721
01:04:35,148 --> 01:04:36,249
He knew I was going to stick the sticker,

1722
01:04:36,249 --> 01:04:38,384
so he put my sticker on himself.

1723
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:39,552
He is...

1724
01:04:39,685 --> 01:04:41,354
- a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

1725
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:43,089
- He's a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

1726
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:45,124
(What was Haha's strategy that Kwang Soo found out?)

1727
01:04:45,124 --> 01:04:47,627
(Kwang Soo is going to betray me anyway.)

1728
01:04:47,627 --> 01:04:48,694
(Sly)

1729
01:04:48,694 --> 01:04:50,396
(He took off his own sticker...)

1730
01:04:50,396 --> 01:04:54,066
(and put on Kwang Soo's sticker.)

1731
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,969
(Even if Kwang Soo betrayed him first,)

1732
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:00,039
(Sang Yeob would have been on Haha's team.)

1733
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:02,208
- He's a dirty human being. - When did you see it?

1734
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:03,976
What's going on?

1735
01:05:04,076 --> 01:05:05,811
Is Kwang Soo's sticker on Sang Yeob?

1736
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:08,014
- Yes. - He tricked me.

1737
01:05:09,048 --> 01:05:11,317
Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo are on the same team.

1738
01:05:11,317 --> 01:05:13,219
- Yes. - Haha is on his own.

1739
01:05:13,219 --> 01:05:14,954
(I'm on my own.)

1740
01:05:14,954 --> 01:05:16,022
Oh, gosh.

1741
01:05:16,022 --> 01:05:18,191
- Congratulations, Sang Yeob. - Thank you.

1742
01:05:18,724 --> 01:05:20,259
Congratulations.

1743
01:05:21,427 --> 01:05:23,663
(How could you do this to me?)

1744
01:05:23,663 --> 01:05:25,831
- You are... - No, Haha.

1745
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:27,333
Think about it.

1746
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,235
I'm guilty too.

1747
01:05:30,736 --> 01:05:32,772
Let's ask Sang Yeob to show us.

1748
01:05:33,139 --> 01:05:35,007
He can do impressions of people.

1749
01:05:35,007 --> 01:05:36,409
After Kim Hak Do...

1750
01:05:36,409 --> 01:05:39,078
After Kim Hak Do and Jeong Jong Chul, he's the best.

1751
01:05:39,111 --> 01:05:41,080
It's true.

1752
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,415
That's the order.

1753
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:44,550
He has a new impression.

1754
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,453
- That day, So Min did... - Oh, right.

1755
01:05:47,453 --> 01:05:49,488
"I have two bullets."

1756
01:05:50,223 --> 01:05:53,759
(There was an impression battle during the filming.)

1757
01:05:54,026 --> 01:05:55,861
I have two bullets.

1758
01:05:57,296 --> 01:06:00,633
(It's an impression of Lee Jung Jae on "Assassination".)

1759
01:06:00,633 --> 01:06:03,603
(He strongly expresses injustice.)

1760
01:06:04,904 --> 01:06:07,106
I was impressed, so I worked on it.

1761
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:09,408
I'm sorry, Jung Jae.

1762
01:06:09,408 --> 01:06:11,277
(How is Sang Yeob's impression of Jung Jae on "Assassination"?)

1763
01:06:11,277 --> 01:06:13,479
"I have two bullets."

1764
01:06:13,479 --> 01:06:15,514
Goodness.

1765
01:06:15,514 --> 01:06:17,617
"I picked these guys,"

1766
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:18,751
"Your Honor."

1767
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,119
He's trying so hard.

1768
01:06:20,419 --> 01:06:25,625
(This is the class of the Grand Award recipient.)

1769
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:28,227
- There are so many people watching. - Excuse us.

1770
01:06:28,227 --> 01:06:29,495
Isn't he great?

1771
01:06:29,495 --> 01:06:31,097
- Isn't he good? - Thank you.

1772
01:06:31,097 --> 01:06:32,531
It was Lee Jung Jae.

1773
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:34,700
Please say a few words in Jang Hyuk's voice.

1774
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:36,402
I think he'll be good.

1775
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:39,605
Thank you.

1776
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:42,908
(They're amazed.)

1777
01:06:42,908 --> 01:06:45,011
I didn't know I was going to get such a great award.

1778
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:49,515
Thank you. "Un Nyun"!

1779
01:06:50,783 --> 01:06:51,984
(The line from "The Slave Hunters" is always funny.)

1780
01:06:51,984 --> 01:06:54,487
I'm sorry, sir.

1781
01:06:54,487 --> 01:06:56,255
Thank you.

1782
01:06:56,255 --> 01:06:57,657
That was so similar.

1783
01:06:57,657 --> 01:06:59,859
(Actor Lee Sang Yeob works hard to develop more impressions.)

1784
01:06:59,859 --> 01:07:01,727
- This is the first game. - I don't 'know what to do.

1785
01:07:01,727 --> 01:07:04,897
The three of you can order a drink each...

1786
01:07:05,464 --> 01:07:07,400
and give your credit cards to the barista.

1787
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,568
If your card is chosen, you lose.

1788
01:07:12,038 --> 01:07:13,873
Yes. Really?

1789
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,207
What's going on?

1790
01:07:15,207 --> 01:07:16,375
(If there are two members in your team, the chance doubles.)

1791
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,179
Then is it better to have more people?

1792
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:22,214
Isn't it a disadvantage to have more?

1793
01:07:22,214 --> 01:07:23,316
(It's more disadvantageous to have more people.)

1794
01:07:23,716 --> 01:07:25,951
(I tried hard to get Sang Yeob on my team.)

1795
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:27,920
Isn't it better to have more people?

1796
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,188
Gosh, this is great.

1797
01:07:29,355 --> 01:07:30,656
It's a great game.

1798
01:07:30,656 --> 01:07:32,358
This one's really good.

1799
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,627
(They learn a lesson on virtue and vice.)

1800
01:07:34,627 --> 01:07:36,028
This is so much fun.

1801
01:07:36,028 --> 01:07:37,396
I have two cards.

1802
01:07:38,364 --> 01:07:39,532
I have two cards.

1803
01:07:39,532 --> 01:07:41,334
- Yes. - Stop it.

1804
01:07:41,334 --> 01:07:42,635
He doesn't care about winning.

1805
01:07:42,735 --> 01:07:44,470
- He doesn't care. - I have one.

1806
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:46,138
I have one.

1807
01:07:46,138 --> 01:07:47,406
Hold on.

1808
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:49,375
I don't know what to do. I just got here.

1809
01:07:49,408 --> 01:07:51,777
This is mine, and this is Kwang Soo's.

1810
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:52,945
(They mix up their credit cards.)

1811
01:07:52,945 --> 01:07:55,348
(Haha, Sang Yeob, Kwang Soo)

1812
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:56,615
Let's go.

1813
01:07:56,615 --> 01:07:58,384
(The game of random chance begins.)

1814
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:01,287
There are three cards.

1815
01:08:01,354 --> 01:08:03,189
- Let's have something sweet. - Yes.

1816
01:08:03,189 --> 01:08:04,323
Let's have a cake.

1817
01:08:04,323 --> 01:08:07,326
Let's see. I want Sang Yeob to order.

1818
01:08:07,727 --> 01:08:09,929
- Me? - Yes. I want to buy you something.

1819
01:08:10,563 --> 01:08:13,666
Do you want to take the order from Jang Hyuk,

1820
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,102
- Jung Woo Sung, or Lee Jung Jae? - Jung Woo Sung.

1821
01:08:16,102 --> 01:08:18,104
- Jung Woo Sung. - Okay.

1822
01:08:18,304 --> 01:08:21,540
Can I have a tiramisu first?

1823
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,310
He does it right away.

1824
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,611
He doesn't say no.

1825
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,546
He's the same.

1826
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:29,915
Drinks? What about drinks?

1827
01:08:29,915 --> 01:08:31,417
Order drinks in Jang Hyuk's voice.

1828
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:33,119
Jang Hyuk.

1829
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,689
- Can I have iced Americano? - Me too.

1830
01:08:36,689 --> 01:08:40,025
Can I have three iced Americano?

1831
01:08:40,092 --> 01:08:41,927
That came out of nowhere.

1832
01:08:42,762 --> 01:08:44,029
That's it.

1833
01:08:44,029 --> 01:08:45,865
We have to pay.

1834
01:08:45,865 --> 01:08:47,500
(It's time to pay. The barista chooses the loser.)

1835
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:49,435
Here you go. Please choose what you like.

1836
01:08:49,702 --> 01:08:51,804
- You can choose any. - Choose any.

1837
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:54,774
(Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob have a 66.66-percent chance...)

1838
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:57,042
(while Haha has a 33.33-percent chance.)

1839
01:08:57,042 --> 01:08:58,944
- You can choose any. - Choose any.

1840
01:09:01,614 --> 01:09:05,184
(It's Haha's.)

1841
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,819
It's his.

1842
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:11,056
(There are so many twists in this race.)

1843
01:09:11,891 --> 01:09:13,559
We have two cards.

1844
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:15,227
We had two.

1845
01:09:15,327 --> 01:09:17,129
We won.

1846
01:09:17,129 --> 01:09:18,864
That was totally unexpected.

1847
01:09:19,098 --> 01:09:20,232
(As a twist, Haha loses.)

1848
01:09:20,232 --> 01:09:23,469
The first game is over. Haha got chosen, so he loses.

1849
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:26,505
(The first game is over.)

1850
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:31,277
What do we do? We are here for Jang Hyuk.

1851
01:09:31,277 --> 01:09:33,179
- My gosh. - I feel bad.

1852
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:34,914
- Right? - This game...

1853
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:36,515
- He's so charismatic. - Right?

1854
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:38,317
You can't make him play that game.

1855
01:09:38,317 --> 01:09:39,418
What plastic bottle?

1856
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,420
- Aren't there other games? - They're friends of 20 years.

1857
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,088
There are other games too.

1858
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:45,524
They have a friendship to preserve.

1859
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:46,592
- You know the rules, right? - Yes.

1860
01:09:46,592 --> 01:09:48,828
If you don't put the sticker on him, you two are a team.

1861
01:09:48,828 --> 01:09:50,396
Let's be on the same team.

1862
01:09:51,664 --> 01:09:52,898
From now on,

1863
01:09:52,898 --> 01:09:55,167
- you have to decide in 5 minutes. - 5 minutes?

1864
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,136
- Okay. - Time's up once I blow the whistle.

1865
01:09:57,136 --> 01:10:00,172
He's in the middle of a drama, and he has a charismatic role.

1866
01:10:00,172 --> 01:10:01,273
He's so charismatic.

1867
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:02,441
Hyuk.

1868
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:04,109
(It's Hyuk.)

1869
01:10:04,109 --> 01:10:05,744
- He's so charismatic. - Hyuk.

1870
01:10:05,744 --> 01:10:08,647
(It's the charismatic actor, Jang Hyuk.)

1871
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,749
You sounded worried.

1872
01:10:10,749 --> 01:10:12,651
I overheard you...

1873
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:14,820
- on the phone. - You were worried.

1874
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:17,590
You were worried about being on our show because of your current role.

1875
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:21,227
When I come on shows that involve my friends,

1876
01:10:21,227 --> 01:10:23,996
I know I have to embarrass myself.

1877
01:10:24,663 --> 01:10:27,032
So... I'm...

1878
01:10:27,032 --> 01:10:29,768
I'm just going to go with it.

1879
01:10:29,768 --> 01:10:32,438
He's not like this. He'll never do this on other shows.

1880
01:10:32,438 --> 01:10:35,741
- I know. - He has standards of his own.

1881
01:10:35,841 --> 01:10:37,276
When he sees us...

1882
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:40,613
When I see Cha Tae Hyun, Kim Jong Kook, and Hong Kyung In,

1883
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:42,581
I give it all.

1884
01:10:42,581 --> 01:10:45,484
Right. Thank you so much. We came here,

1885
01:10:45,484 --> 01:10:47,386
- but we're bothering you. - I feel bad.

1886
01:10:47,386 --> 01:10:50,823
- He's doing so well. - That's right.

1887
01:10:50,823 --> 01:10:52,892
- You're in the middle of a drama. - Right.

1888
01:10:52,892 --> 01:10:54,159
You need to take a break. We are sorry.

1889
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,694
- Sorry. - It's all right.

1890
01:10:55,694 --> 01:10:57,897
It's cold, so let's hurry.

1891
01:10:57,897 --> 01:10:59,331
- Yes. - All right.

1892
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:00,566
- It's over? - It's been five minutes.

1893
01:11:00,566 --> 01:11:01,634
- It's over? - Time's up?

1894
01:11:01,634 --> 01:11:03,202
We were asking how he was doing.

1895
01:11:03,202 --> 01:11:04,837
That doesn't count.

1896
01:11:04,837 --> 01:11:06,205
It's too bad,

1897
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,307
but Hyuk is on his own.

1898
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,844
Seok Jin and Jong Kook are on the same team.

1899
01:11:11,844 --> 01:11:12,912
No way.

1900
01:11:12,912 --> 01:11:14,213
What do we have to do?

1901
01:11:14,213 --> 01:11:15,648
- Goodness. - Let me explain.

1902
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:17,616
It's a game. It's 2 versus 1.

1903
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:22,054
Here's the game you'll be playing.

1904
01:11:23,822 --> 01:11:25,024
- It's simple. - We will explain.

1905
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:27,126
We asked for a different game.

1906
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:31,030
(I have to play that game?)

1907
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,731
We asked.

1908
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:34,066
We asked for another game.

1909
01:11:34,733 --> 01:11:36,835
- We asked. - We tried...

1910
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,103
to change it.

1911
01:11:38,103 --> 01:11:40,239
- We asked. - They said they didn't have any.

1912
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,474
- We asked. We're so sorry. - We didn't want to do it.

1913
01:11:42,474 --> 01:11:44,677
I felt so bad. You're my friend.

1914
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:48,414
This game is called Snort of 12.

1915
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:51,984
I have to blow this with my nose?

1916
01:11:52,551 --> 01:11:53,919
I told you. We tried.

1917
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:55,621
We asked for a different game.

1918
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,290
- We tried for an hour. - We asked for another one.

1919
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:00,659
- We asked for a different one. - We tried many times.

1920
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:03,095
- We did. Sorry. - We asked for another one.

1921
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:06,832
Why don't you just recruit me? I'll just be a regular.

1922
01:12:07,132 --> 01:12:10,002
- I'll be a regular. - Please.

1923
01:12:10,002 --> 01:12:11,337
We need a contract.

1924
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,738
The rules are simple.

1925
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:16,175
Breathe into the plastic bottles with your nose,

1926
01:12:16,241 --> 01:12:19,211
and the team that unflattens the bottles first wins.

1927
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:20,312
(1, 2, 3, 4)

1928
01:12:20,312 --> 01:12:21,914
He's counting.

1929
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:23,582
(He did.)

1930
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,185
Don't you need to blow your nose?

1931
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:27,886
I do.

1932
01:12:27,886 --> 01:12:29,955
Just in case. Thank you.

1933
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:32,224
Let's get clean first.

1934
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:35,227
It's like getting rid of last year's germs.

1935
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:37,229
I'm so sorry, Hyuk. We won't take long.

1936
01:12:38,163 --> 01:12:39,398
I'm sorry,

1937
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:41,033
- Top Excellence Award winner. - You two were the winners.

1938
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:43,736
We're both Top Excellence Award winners. I'm sorry.

1939
01:12:43,736 --> 01:12:45,904
Let me repeat. We tried to negotiate for an hour.

1940
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,941
- Let's unflatten this a little. - Jong Kook said...

1941
01:12:48,941 --> 01:12:50,643
his friend has a charismatic role.

1942
01:12:50,643 --> 01:12:53,646
Let's help him a little. They're too tight.

1943
01:12:53,646 --> 01:12:55,514
No, no.

1944
01:12:56,215 --> 01:12:59,251
- We have to do this properly. - It has to be fair?

1945
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,987
- Let's crush ours. - Okay.

1946
01:13:01,987 --> 01:13:04,156
- This... - Let's do that.

1947
01:13:04,156 --> 01:13:06,091
- Let's crush them a lot. - Okay.

1948
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,761
(He doesn't try.)

1949
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:09,895
Let's crush them.

1950
01:13:09,895 --> 01:13:13,365
You're pretending like you're crushing them.

1951
01:13:13,599 --> 01:13:15,501
- I'll do it. - I thought...

1952
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:17,102
- he was crushing them. - No.

1953
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:18,804
- You're faking it. - I did it.

1954
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:20,239
I really did it.

1955
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:22,574
Ours are so crushed.

1956
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:24,176
- Get ready. - Let's do this.

1957
01:13:24,176 --> 01:13:26,111
(Hyuk has to beat the other two with his nose muscles.)

1958
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:28,347
Do this. It doesn't take long.

1959
01:13:28,547 --> 01:13:29,848
Ready.

1960
01:13:31,116 --> 01:13:32,317
Set...

1961
01:13:32,317 --> 01:13:36,422
(Will Hyuk give it his best and win the mission?)

1962
01:13:36,755 --> 01:13:39,825
(He unflattens it in one try.)

1963
01:13:40,526 --> 01:13:43,195
(He sweeps it with his large lung capacity.)

1964
01:13:43,195 --> 01:13:44,663
(Meanwhile...)

1965
01:13:45,664 --> 01:13:48,300
(He's barely doing anything.)

1966
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:51,003
This is not working. How is he doing this?

1967
01:13:51,003 --> 01:13:52,404
Hurry up!

1968
01:13:53,572 --> 01:13:54,840
How do you do this?

1969
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,578
(Hyuk is faster than the other two.)

1970
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:02,281
(They're doing two at a time and are catching up.)

1971
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:03,615
This is not working.

1972
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:05,317
(He runs out of energy.)

1973
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:06,452
Next.

1974
01:14:06,785 --> 01:14:09,521
How many did he do? My snot is coming out.

1975
01:14:09,521 --> 01:14:11,590
(This match is unpredictable.)

1976
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,328
(It's over.)

1977
01:14:16,328 --> 01:14:17,663
My gosh.

1978
01:14:18,263 --> 01:14:19,331
(Giggling)

1979
01:14:19,331 --> 01:14:20,532
My gosh.

1980
01:14:20,933 --> 01:14:22,301
- Good job. - Was I funny?

1981
01:14:22,868 --> 01:14:24,136
- Was that fun? - Hyuk.

1982
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:26,205
(He cares more about being funny than his appearance.)

1983
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:27,306
I'm sorry.

1984
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,108
I'm so sorry.

1985
01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:30,409
It's totally okay.

1986
01:14:30,409 --> 01:14:31,777
That was so funny.

1987
01:14:31,777 --> 01:14:33,345
You tried your best.

1988
01:14:33,345 --> 01:14:35,647
Thanks so much.

1989
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:38,817
There's one of Hyuk's that's not unflatten properly,

1990
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,821
so Seok Jin and Jong Kook win.

1991
01:14:42,821 --> 01:14:44,590
(They win 20 ddakjis.)

1992
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,657
Sorry.

1993
01:14:45,657 --> 01:14:47,626
- He tried his best. - He did.

1994
01:14:47,626 --> 01:14:49,528
- Did you see his face? - Excuse me.

1995
01:14:49,928 --> 01:14:51,196
I couldn't do it because I was laughing.

1996
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:53,198
If it's really bad, please blur it out.

1997
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:56,535
- They'll do a good job. - I'm acting as a lawyer.

1998
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:58,704
It'll be fine.

1999
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:03,208
On my sixth bottle, I turned a bit pale.

2000
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:04,543
(He cares more about winning than the friendship.)

2001
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:07,379
- So I switched nostrils. - You turned pale?

2002
01:15:07,546 --> 01:15:09,214
- You switched nostrils? - I was doing this side,

2003
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,416
and I couldn't keep it up, so I switched.

2004
01:15:13,018 --> 01:15:16,255
(He got dizzy,)

2005
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:18,390
(so he switched to the other nostril.)

2006
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:20,692
There's a request from the Running Man fans.

2007
01:15:20,692 --> 01:15:23,028
Lee Sang Yeob did an impression of you.

2008
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:25,464
He got popular for saying, "Un Nyun".

2009
01:15:26,698 --> 01:15:28,400
"Un Nyun!"

2010
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:33,338
(The fans wanted to see the original version.)

2011
01:15:33,338 --> 01:15:35,073
Can we see the original?

2012
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:36,308
- Did you see it? - Did you?

2013
01:15:36,308 --> 01:15:38,710
- Did you see it on Running Man? - That line...

2014
01:15:38,844 --> 01:15:40,779
- is not supposed to be like that. - Then?

2015
01:15:40,779 --> 01:15:42,114
What is it?

2016
01:15:42,114 --> 01:15:43,816
He did it really weirdly.

2017
01:15:43,816 --> 01:15:46,652
- Really? - It looked weird.

2018
01:15:46,652 --> 01:15:48,387
Show us the original.

2019
01:15:48,387 --> 01:15:50,589
(How does the original do it?)

2020
01:15:50,589 --> 01:15:54,226
"Un Nyun". Like this.

2021
01:15:54,493 --> 01:15:55,961
- Was that it? - Yes.

2022
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:57,162
- Is this the original? - Yes.

2023
01:15:57,162 --> 01:15:58,297
It's the same.

2024
01:15:58,297 --> 01:15:59,965
(These two...)

2025
01:15:59,965 --> 01:16:02,868
(are not that different.)

2026
01:16:02,868 --> 01:16:04,102
(It's the same.)

2027
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,103
"Un Nyun".

2028
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:07,306
Maybe I speak and hear differently.

2029
01:16:07,639 --> 01:16:09,074
Perhaps.

2030
01:16:10,576 --> 01:16:12,177
We're finally here.

2031
01:16:12,177 --> 01:16:13,812
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan are by Sangam SBS Prism Tower.)

2032
01:16:13,812 --> 01:16:15,247
- She's here. - Is that her?

2033
01:16:15,247 --> 01:16:16,481
The lights are on.

2034
01:16:16,481 --> 01:16:18,116
(They're waiting for their guest.)

2035
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:21,253
(Only top stars drive this car.)

2036
01:16:21,253 --> 01:16:26,158
(Who's inside the car?)

2037
01:16:26,358 --> 01:16:27,659
- Na Rae. - Oh, dear.

2038
01:16:27,659 --> 01:16:30,863
(It's Park Na Rae, the star of entertainment awards.)

2039
01:16:30,863 --> 01:16:32,231
- Na Rae. - Oh, dear.

2040
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:34,099
Na Rae.

2041
01:16:34,099 --> 01:16:35,267
- Na Rae. - Na Rae.

2042
01:16:35,267 --> 01:16:36,869
- What's going on? - Na Rae.

2043
01:16:36,869 --> 01:16:38,403
(What happened among them?)

2044
01:16:39,204 --> 01:16:41,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2045
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:46,144
We're in trouble. This is going nowhere.

2046
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:47,679
(They stopped at a bus station.)

2047
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:49,982
- It's here. - Let's go there.

2048
01:16:50,249 --> 01:16:52,718
(Sangam was 12 stations away.)

2049
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:54,887
- Let's go. - Go.

2050
01:16:56,455 --> 01:16:59,725
("Comedy Big League" was being filmed today.)

2051
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:02,094
- Let's go there. - They're in Sangam.

2052
01:17:02,461 --> 01:17:03,528
Hold on.

2053
01:17:03,528 --> 01:17:05,397
(He's called Na Rae.)

2054
01:17:05,397 --> 01:17:06,598
- Hello? - Na Rae.

2055
01:17:06,832 --> 01:17:08,400
- Yes? - Where are you?

2056
01:17:08,634 --> 01:17:09,835
I'm on my way.

2057
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:12,471
- During our team dinner, - Yes.

2058
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:15,774
you made a big mess, so we have to talk.

2059
01:17:15,774 --> 01:17:19,044
I'll be in the parking lot we always park in.

2060
01:17:19,111 --> 01:17:20,579
See you later.

2061
01:17:21,914 --> 01:17:23,048
Really?

2062
01:17:23,048 --> 01:17:24,850
Have some tangerines.

2063
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,418
Na Rae.

2064
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:28,186
Are you sober now?

2065
01:17:28,487 --> 01:17:30,088
Are you okay?

2066
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:31,757
I'm going to court. What's going on?

2067
01:17:31,757 --> 01:17:33,258
Let's talk about that later.

2068
01:17:33,558 --> 01:17:34,760
Put on a microphone.

2069
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,928
What's going on?

2070
01:17:36,061 --> 01:17:37,963
Why am I putting this on? I have to go in.

2071
01:17:37,963 --> 01:17:39,531
- I need my jacket. - Give us 10 minutes.

2072
01:17:39,731 --> 01:17:41,500
- 10 minutes? - It'll only take 10 minutes.

2073
01:17:41,533 --> 01:17:44,636
You need to dress like a celebrity.

2074
01:17:45,437 --> 01:17:46,571
Here it is.

2075
01:17:46,571 --> 01:17:48,907
You didn't disappoint us with that color.

2076
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:52,444
Why are we all wearing only primary colors?

2077
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:55,714
- This is tangerine. - Tangerine? I see.

2078
01:17:56,415 --> 01:17:58,317
- We're doing a mission. - Okay.

2079
01:17:58,317 --> 01:18:03,121
Can you spare 10 minutes for us? Let's go to SBS.

2080
01:18:03,288 --> 01:18:04,456
What mission is this?

2081
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:06,325
- It's so simple. - Really?

2082
01:18:06,325 --> 01:18:08,660
I don't think you are sober yet.

2083
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,962
I don't think you are.

2084
01:18:09,962 --> 01:18:11,830
- That night was intense. - Na Rae.

2085
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:14,466
- This is really simple. - It's simple.

2086
01:18:15,033 --> 01:18:18,236
(Are there stones on a dish with a cup on the bottom?)

2087
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:20,672
- Explain. - We hold this...

2088
01:18:20,672 --> 01:18:24,609
and throw it up. If all five stones go in the cup, you win.

2089
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:26,445
- It's over once you do it 1st. - You have 5 chances.

2090
01:18:26,445 --> 01:18:27,679
But you're on your own.

2091
01:18:29,681 --> 01:18:30,983
- What? - You're by yourself.

2092
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,150
You're on your own.

2093
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,452
But there's a condition.

2094
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:36,321
If you get five in the cup first,

2095
01:18:36,421 --> 01:18:38,657
you win a big prize.

2096
01:18:38,657 --> 01:18:39,758
- Really? - Yes.

2097
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:42,027
This is not just for fun.

2098
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:43,462
We have to do this.

2099
01:18:43,462 --> 01:18:45,297
- We have to win. - We have to get this.

2100
01:18:45,297 --> 01:18:47,432
Our lives depend on this, Se Chan.

2101
01:18:47,432 --> 01:18:49,468
- This better be worth our time. - I know.

2102
01:18:49,468 --> 01:18:50,535
Ready.

2103
01:18:50,535 --> 01:18:54,139
(This is their first step toward winning.)

2104
01:18:54,139 --> 01:18:55,307
Set...

2105
01:18:56,341 --> 01:18:58,510
(Flipping)

2106
01:18:58,510 --> 01:18:59,611
Okay.

2107
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,279
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan get 2 at a time.)

2108
01:19:02,848 --> 01:19:04,149
- Okay. - Hold on.

2109
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:05,517
- We only have one left. - Ji Hyo.

2110
01:19:05,517 --> 01:19:06,785
Take a breath.

2111
01:19:07,152 --> 01:19:09,888
(Meanwhile for Na Rae...)

2112
01:19:09,888 --> 01:19:11,623
My gosh. Why is this not working?

2113
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:14,326
(Sighing)

2114
01:19:14,326 --> 01:19:17,195
Ji Hyo, take a breath.

2115
01:19:17,195 --> 01:19:18,563
We're almost done.

2116
01:19:18,563 --> 01:19:19,931
Oh, dear. Na Rae.

2117
01:19:19,931 --> 01:19:22,167
- You still have shaky hands. - Wait.

2118
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:25,537
(She has unexplained shaky hands.)

2119
01:19:25,537 --> 01:19:26,605
You have a tremor,

2120
01:19:26,605 --> 01:19:29,408
- so you can't do it. - Move over.

2121
01:19:29,875 --> 01:19:31,043
(Flying)

2122
01:19:32,978 --> 01:19:35,781
- Stop drinking. - Goodness.

2123
01:19:35,781 --> 01:19:37,883
Running Man is rated 12A.

2124
01:19:37,883 --> 01:19:41,453
- She's so funny. - Na Rae, we're done.

2125
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:42,754
- You are? - We have one left.

2126
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:44,122
We have one left.

2127
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:46,191
- Okay. - There you go.

2128
01:19:46,425 --> 01:19:47,826
All right. Get ready, Ji Hyo.

2129
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,896
- Okay. - Go, Ji Hyo.

2130
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:53,265
- My goodness. - Ji Hyo, hurry up.

2131
01:19:53,265 --> 01:19:54,833
Ji Hyo, Na Rae got the hang of it.

2132
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,535
Na Rae got the hang of it.

2133
01:19:56,535 --> 01:19:58,103
Na Rae got the hang of it. You need to hurry up.

2134
01:19:58,103 --> 01:19:59,738
- Okay. - Hurry up.

2135
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:01,506
Okay!

2136
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,842
(She comes from behind and wins.)

2137
01:20:04,409 --> 01:20:08,580
(This must be how the hare looked after losing to the tortoise.)

2138
01:20:09,815 --> 01:20:12,818
You should have picked up the stones for me.

2139
01:20:13,018 --> 01:20:15,253
Woman-who-is-pushing-40, what are you doing?

2140
01:20:15,253 --> 01:20:18,356
I ran around the room because of you.

2141
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:20,959
You should have picked up the stones for me.

2142
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:25,063
Hold on. How did you do so well toward the end?

2143
01:20:25,063 --> 01:20:27,799
My hands began to shake in a rhythmical way.

2144
01:20:27,799 --> 01:20:30,202
(My hands began to shake in a rhythmical way.)

2145
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:34,606
(Rhythmical)

2146
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:38,910
Na Rae got the hang of it. This is a disaster.

2147
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,346
Okay. We will give Na Rae a gift.

2148
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:45,183
Na Rae, your appearance on Running Man...

2149
01:20:45,183 --> 01:20:49,020
earned you a gift.

2150
01:20:50,622 --> 01:20:52,157
- Thank you for your hard work. - Hold on.

2151
01:20:52,157 --> 01:20:55,460
- Running Man gives you tangerines. - Hold on.

2152
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,796
- It matches your outfit. - They match.

2153
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:01,166
Please take these tangerines. I hope you have a good shoot today.

2154
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:03,602
Hold on. These tangerines look familiar.

2155
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:05,737
How did they come back to me?

2156
01:21:05,737 --> 01:21:07,772
You know,

2157
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:09,808
- life is a circle. - That's right.

2158
01:21:09,808 --> 01:21:11,376
- Bye. Thank you. - Good luck.

2159
01:21:11,376 --> 01:21:12,878
- All right. - Bye.

2160
01:21:12,878 --> 01:21:14,279
Good luck. Happy New Year!

2161
01:21:14,279 --> 01:21:15,614
Happy New Year!

2162
01:21:15,614 --> 01:21:17,349
(Thank you for coming despite your busy schedule, Na Rae.)

2163
01:21:17,716 --> 01:21:19,684
The one with the Rookie Award.

2164
01:21:19,684 --> 01:21:21,486
- All right. - It's hot.

2165
01:21:21,486 --> 01:21:22,554
(So Min's score is 85.)

2166
01:21:22,554 --> 01:21:24,022
I will go next.

2167
01:21:24,789 --> 01:21:26,458
Which song will you sing?

2168
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:27,526
I will sing "Darling".

2169
01:21:28,093 --> 01:21:29,161
He lives young, right?

2170
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:31,196
I was going to sing "Flower" by Jang Yun Jung.

2171
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:33,265
- That's a good idea. - Let's stick to trot.

2172
01:21:35,267 --> 01:21:38,537
(I must win.)

2173
01:21:40,205 --> 01:21:43,108
(A backup dancer interferes.)

2174
01:21:43,975 --> 01:21:45,777
(Stepping)

2175
01:21:46,077 --> 01:21:49,047
(He tries his best to concentrate.)

2176
01:21:52,984 --> 01:21:54,619
(She grabs the attention.)

2177
01:21:56,488 --> 01:21:58,590
(He is annoyed.)

2178
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:02,093
(So Min's dance makes Jae Seok impatient.)

2179
01:22:02,594 --> 01:22:03,695
What is going on?

2180
01:22:03,695 --> 01:22:05,764
(He takes off his clothes one by one.)

2181
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,667
(Darling)

2182
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:10,101
(You)

2183
01:22:10,268 --> 01:22:12,671
(Jae Seok's performance gets edited to meet TV guidelines.)

2184
01:22:13,705 --> 01:22:14,806
(Jae Seok's "Darling" receives a score of 83.)

2185
01:22:14,806 --> 01:22:16,074
- Thank goodness. - We did it.

2186
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:18,343
Jae Seok, why are you so bad at singing?

2187
01:22:18,343 --> 01:22:20,412
How are we two points apart when he sang so terribly?

2188
01:22:20,412 --> 01:22:23,081
So Min, the key wasn't high.

2189
01:22:23,081 --> 01:22:24,716
- He just can't sing. - Don't be ridiculous.

2190
01:22:24,716 --> 01:22:27,219
(It's So Min's fault.)

2191
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:30,021
If you score 82, it's a tie. If you score 81, you lose.

2192
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:31,623
Young Chul, help me.

2193
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:34,159
Don't worry. It will be game over once I sing this song.

2194
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:35,493
Young Chul.

2195
01:22:35,527 --> 01:22:37,529
- "Flower" by Jang Yun Jung. - All right.

2196
01:22:37,529 --> 01:22:39,397
- That's good. - Don't lower the key.

2197
01:22:39,397 --> 01:22:40,865
The current key is for women.

2198
01:22:40,865 --> 01:22:42,801
The key was high for Taeyang's song, too.

2199
01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:43,802
The current key is for women.

2200
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:45,303
(His score needs to be 81 or less for Jae Seok to win.)

2201
01:22:45,804 --> 01:22:47,739
I lowered the key since it was for women.

2202
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,875
(I have to do something.)

2203
01:22:51,576 --> 01:22:52,711
(Grabbing)

2204
01:22:54,212 --> 01:22:56,815
(He blocks the microphone...)

2205
01:22:56,815 --> 01:22:58,883
(and tickles Young Chul.)

2206
01:22:59,284 --> 01:23:01,886
(He attacks like an immature child.)

2207
01:23:01,886 --> 01:23:03,021
What are you doing?

2208
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:04,723
Move.

2209
01:23:06,324 --> 01:23:08,860
(Don't pester Young Chul.)

2210
01:23:09,427 --> 01:23:11,096
(Following)

2211
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:18,303
(Young Chul, focus on singing.)

2212
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:21,206
(What are you doing?)

2213
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,142
(She attacks viciously.)

2214
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:28,880
(A match that began with betrayal becomes a fistfight.)

2215
01:23:28,913 --> 01:23:30,048
(Grabbing)

2216
01:23:31,349 --> 01:23:32,984
(Pulling)

2217
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:36,288
(As the fight becomes more fierce,)

2218
01:23:36,288 --> 01:23:39,958
(the singing contest loses its original meaning.)

2219
01:23:40,692 --> 01:23:43,561
(She anesthetizes him.)

2220
01:23:44,462 --> 01:23:47,232
(As Jae Seok gets anesthetized,)

2221
01:23:47,232 --> 01:23:50,168
(Young Chul's steps turn sadder.)

2222
01:23:50,168 --> 01:23:52,370
For goodness' sake. Come here.

2223
01:23:52,370 --> 01:23:55,373
They will take all of my screen time.

2224
01:23:55,373 --> 01:23:56,541
Let go.

2225
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:58,743
(Both the singer and the listeners are in tatters.)

2226
01:24:00,412 --> 01:24:02,447
(Young Chul's song is over.)

2227
01:24:02,447 --> 01:24:03,915
Let's see it.

2228
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:06,084
(It's time to check the score.)

2229
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:09,087
(If the score is 81 or less, Jae Seok wins.)

2230
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:11,790
(If the score is 82 or more, So Min and Young Chul win.)

2231
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,525
The score, please.

2232
01:24:14,025 --> 01:24:16,161
99! Give me a big hand.

2233
01:24:16,161 --> 01:24:17,529
(So Min and Young Chul win.)

2234
01:24:17,529 --> 01:24:19,964
(Young Chul is the king of karaoke machines.)

2235
01:24:19,964 --> 01:24:23,201
I am a singer.

2236
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:25,737
"Are you the king of singers?" I am a singer.

2237
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:27,539
Good job, Young Chul.

2238
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:30,842
(So Min debuts successfully as a singer.)

2239
01:24:32,243 --> 01:24:34,612
So Min will receive 20 ddakjis.

2240
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:37,282
(Meanwhile, Haha and Kwang Soo...)

2241
01:24:37,282 --> 01:24:38,550
It's coming.

2242
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:41,586
- Thank you for the dessert. - Thank you.

2243
01:24:41,586 --> 01:24:44,622
Their dessert is popular.

2244
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,392
- Thank you. - My goodness.

2245
01:24:47,392 --> 01:24:49,494
- Thank you. - Sang Yeob, it's good to see you.

2246
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:51,696
- Seriously. Congratulations. - I missed you.

2247
01:24:51,696 --> 01:24:53,264
- I really missed you. - I missed you.

2248
01:24:53,264 --> 01:24:54,399
Thank you.

2249
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,568
(They enjoy a coffee break with Sang Yeob.)

2250
01:24:56,568 --> 01:24:59,371
Even the ice looks splendid.

2251
01:24:59,371 --> 01:25:00,472
I know.

2252
01:25:00,572 --> 01:25:02,107
What did you do yesterday?

2253
01:25:03,074 --> 01:25:05,043
I went home after the awards ceremony.

2254
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:06,644
You were really happy, right?

2255
01:25:06,911 --> 01:25:09,147
- Congratulations. - Seriously.

2256
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:11,383
I was so happy...

2257
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:13,084
that I drank a lot.

2258
01:25:13,084 --> 01:25:14,386
You drank.

2259
01:25:14,386 --> 01:25:15,453
The occasion called for it.

2260
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:18,223
When you called me,

2261
01:25:18,223 --> 01:25:20,325
- I was getting scolded by my mom. - Really?

2262
01:25:20,325 --> 01:25:21,693
That's why I picked up right away. "Hello?"

2263
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:23,762
That's why you picked up.

2264
01:25:23,762 --> 01:25:26,064
He answered a call from an unknown number.

2265
01:25:26,064 --> 01:25:28,633
I would have even answered a spam call about loans...

2266
01:25:28,633 --> 01:25:29,734
at that moment.

2267
01:25:29,968 --> 01:25:32,670
Had a loan shark called me, I would have gone, "Hello?"

2268
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:35,607
That's hilarious.

2269
01:25:35,607 --> 01:25:36,741
He is good.

2270
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:40,512
I love Sang Yeob. I love him.

2271
01:25:40,512 --> 01:25:42,313
That goes without saying.

2272
01:25:42,781 --> 01:25:44,482
You seem busy these days.

2273
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:46,451
(He suddenly talks to Kwang Soo.)

2274
01:25:46,818 --> 01:25:48,153
- Me? - Never mind.

2275
01:25:48,219 --> 01:25:49,888
Sang Yeob...

2276
01:25:49,954 --> 01:25:51,890
Sang Yeob is so refreshing.

2277
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,325
He is like lemon tart. He is so refreshing.

2278
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,228
Something is different...

2279
01:25:57,228 --> 01:25:58,396
- about him. - You hurt my feelings.

2280
01:25:59,097 --> 01:26:01,032
Why did you clench your fist?

2281
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,468
- He is really different. - My feelings are hurt.

2282
01:26:03,468 --> 01:26:06,037
(A star with blood type B, a star who is wanted as a member)

2283
01:26:06,037 --> 01:26:09,107
I will give you the mission now as you may be required to wait.

2284
01:26:09,574 --> 01:26:10,975
This is the second mission.

2285
01:26:10,975 --> 01:26:13,378
If Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win, the game ends.

2286
01:26:13,378 --> 01:26:14,479
- It's game over, right? - Yes.

2287
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:15,647
(If Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win, the game ends.)

2288
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,848
This is your second choice.

2289
01:26:17,515 --> 01:26:18,783
Once the mission begins,

2290
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:20,084
(Choice of 12, Round 2)

2291
01:26:20,084 --> 01:26:22,520
you win if the customer who walks into the cafe...

2292
01:26:22,654 --> 01:26:24,722
orders the menu you chose.

2293
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:27,025
Please pick a menu before the mission begins.

2294
01:26:27,859 --> 01:26:29,694
(You win the mission...)

2295
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:33,431
(by correctly guessing the menu the first customer will order.)

2296
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:34,866
(If either Sang Yeob or Kwang Soo gets it right,)

2297
01:26:34,866 --> 01:26:36,334
(Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo win.)

2298
01:26:36,334 --> 01:26:38,036
- We should choose differently. - We have an advantage.

2299
01:26:38,036 --> 01:26:39,671
- We do. - We have an advantage.

2300
01:26:39,671 --> 01:26:41,272
I made up my mind.

2301
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:45,076
Since there are a lot of female customers,

2302
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,545
I will choose hot latte.

2303
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:51,216
Since it's cold, I will choose hot chocolate.

2304
01:26:51,549 --> 01:26:52,884
Women like hot chocolate.

2305
01:26:52,884 --> 01:26:54,853
You can't change your choice after you say it.

2306
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,022
Then I will also choose hot latte.

2307
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:01,226
Why don't the two of you play Dreadful Pirate?

2308
01:27:02,193 --> 01:27:04,295
You want to ruin my chance.

2309
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:07,699
- I will choose a different one. - Which one?

2310
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:11,903
I will choose hot Americano.

2311
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,940
(Hot Americano, Hot chocolate, Hot latte)

2312
01:27:17,242 --> 01:27:19,077
Kwang Soo drives me crazy.

2313
01:27:19,077 --> 01:27:21,746
I am playing clean and fair today.

2314
01:27:21,813 --> 01:27:24,015
- I am serious. - You are playing fair?

2315
01:27:24,115 --> 01:27:25,283
Of course, I am.

2316
01:27:26,584 --> 01:27:29,521
Okay. Let's take this to the end. We don't know what will happen.

2317
01:27:29,621 --> 01:27:33,625
(They wait for a customer.)

2318
01:27:33,625 --> 01:27:36,060
We just need to wait until the next customer comes.

2319
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,962
- We should talk. - I see.

2320
01:27:38,596 --> 01:27:40,198
This is how a variety show works.

2321
01:27:41,332 --> 01:27:44,135
(5 minutes pass.)

2322
01:27:44,135 --> 01:27:46,371
(10 minutes pass.)

2323
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:48,873
(20 minutes pass.)

2324
01:27:48,873 --> 01:27:51,442
(No customer comes.)

2325
01:27:54,345 --> 01:27:55,880
(Rustling)

2326
01:27:57,282 --> 01:27:59,484
Sung Yong, I need to go to the restroom.

2327
01:28:00,318 --> 01:28:01,920
Do you need to use the restroom?

2328
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,755
I am okay. I am okay.

2329
01:28:03,755 --> 01:28:05,790
- Do you need to go? - I will be back soon.

2330
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:09,327
(Another 5 minutes pass.)

2331
01:28:10,595 --> 01:28:12,030
(The shoot resumes.)

2332
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,431
You will go with the menus you chose.

2333
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:14,566
- Yes. - Of course.

2334
01:28:16,367 --> 01:28:18,970
I still don't know why I am here.

2335
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:20,572
Where is the trophy?

2336
01:28:20,572 --> 01:28:22,040
- Here. - There you go.

2337
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,074
(He remembers he was invited as a star with blood type B.)

2338
01:28:23,074 --> 01:28:24,242
There you go.

2339
01:28:24,242 --> 01:28:26,210
It's an important award.

2340
01:28:26,911 --> 01:28:28,580
Lets' play rock-paper-scissors. I want to see my fortune.

2341
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:29,614
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2342
01:28:29,614 --> 01:28:31,516
(Haha wins alone by playing rock.)

2343
01:28:31,516 --> 01:28:32,584
What?

2344
01:28:32,584 --> 01:28:33,585
Two scissors.

2345
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:35,153
(Two scissors.)

2346
01:28:35,453 --> 01:28:37,655
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2347
01:28:38,289 --> 01:28:39,424
Rock-paper-scissors

2348
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:41,025
(Kwang Soo wins.)

2349
01:28:41,025 --> 01:28:42,594
He ended up winning.

2350
01:28:42,994 --> 01:28:44,128
He drives me crazy.

2351
01:28:45,597 --> 01:28:46,998
I am in a good mood today.

2352
01:28:47,899 --> 01:28:49,434
Me too.

2353
01:28:50,201 --> 01:28:51,336
By the way,

2354
01:28:51,803 --> 01:28:54,038
I take back my words about removing the water bomb.

2355
01:28:54,038 --> 01:28:56,207
(I take back my words about removing the water bomb.)

2356
01:28:56,441 --> 01:28:57,642
- What? - I said I'd remove it before.

2357
01:28:57,642 --> 01:28:59,344
You can't take back your words.

2358
01:28:59,344 --> 01:29:00,511
I just did.

2359
01:29:00,511 --> 01:29:02,780
(It's too late.)

2360
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,848
Okay.

2361
01:29:04,749 --> 01:29:06,618
- A customer is here. - Hold on.

2362
01:29:06,618 --> 01:29:08,886
(A customer comes in.)

2363
01:29:08,886 --> 01:29:12,857
(A customer comes in after 30 minutes of waiting.)

2364
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:15,627
Hot Americano, please.

2365
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,630
(He orders Haha's choice, hot Americano.)

2366
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:20,164
Hey.

2367
01:29:20,164 --> 01:29:21,966
(Something is strange.)

2368
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:24,002
Are you drinking it here?

2369
01:29:24,102 --> 01:29:25,269
It's to go.

2370
01:29:25,269 --> 01:29:26,270
(Why is Kwang Soo upset?)

2371
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,538
(What?)

2372
01:29:27,538 --> 01:29:29,440
(Who is he?)

2373
01:29:29,507 --> 01:29:32,243
(He made people laugh on the show.)

2374
01:29:32,243 --> 01:29:35,380
(He was a character who was as pure as snow.)

2375
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:38,583
(Haha's best friend, Park Geun Sik)

2376
01:29:38,916 --> 01:29:40,351
(No matter which mission he gets...)

2377
01:29:40,852 --> 01:29:42,453
(Rice and seasoning)

2378
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,955
(With his pure brain,)

2379
01:29:43,955 --> 01:29:46,290
(he made his presence known.)

2380
01:29:46,457 --> 01:29:48,626
(Did Haha's friend, Geun Sik,)

2381
01:29:48,626 --> 01:29:52,030
(visit the cafe by chance?)

2382
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,398
Hold on.

2383
01:29:53,398 --> 01:29:54,932
(My gosh. I know what's happening now.)

2384
01:29:55,366 --> 01:29:58,302
(What on earth happened?)

2385
01:29:58,369 --> 01:29:59,637
(10 minutes ago)

2386
01:29:59,637 --> 01:30:01,105
Hey, let's go to the restroom.

2387
01:30:02,774 --> 01:30:05,710
(Haha said that he was going to the restroom.)

2388
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:08,112
(But why is he coming back without using the restroom?)

2389
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,848
Hey, Kwang Soo... Hey, hey.

2390
01:30:11,082 --> 01:30:12,450
Hey, where are you now?

2391
01:30:13,051 --> 01:30:14,385
I'm pooping.

2392
01:30:14,385 --> 01:30:15,620
- You're pooping? - Yes.

2393
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,855
Can you come here right now and do a mission with me?

2394
01:30:17,855 --> 01:30:19,123
We are in Hongdae.

2395
01:30:19,390 --> 01:30:22,126
Come and just say, "Hot Americano, please."

2396
01:30:22,326 --> 01:30:23,661
I'll treat you to coffee.

2397
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:25,763
I'll send you the address. Stop pooping, and come right away.

2398
01:30:25,897 --> 01:30:27,765
- Okay. - Come as quickly as you can.

2399
01:30:27,999 --> 01:30:30,935
(Exactly 5 minutes later...)

2400
01:30:31,502 --> 01:30:33,538
- He's here. - Wait.

2401
01:30:33,538 --> 01:30:35,306
- Hot Americano, please. - Hold on.

2402
01:30:36,607 --> 01:30:37,842
Hey.

2403
01:30:37,842 --> 01:30:39,510
(He pretends that he doesn't see the camera.)

2404
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:40,812
Hot Americano, please.

2405
01:30:40,912 --> 01:30:42,113
Are you drinking it here?

2406
01:30:42,113 --> 01:30:43,414
It's to go.

2407
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:45,950
- Hey. - What?

2408
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:47,251
(He pretends to be surprised.)

2409
01:30:47,652 --> 01:30:48,920
Hey, Geun Sik, what brings you here?

2410
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,688
- Hey. - I came here for a cup of coffee.

2411
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:51,889
My gosh, why are you here?

2412
01:30:51,889 --> 01:30:53,558
- Gosh. - Long time, no see.

2413
01:30:53,558 --> 01:30:54,926
- What is this? - This is Lee Sang Yeob, the actor.

2414
01:30:54,926 --> 01:30:56,527
- Oh, my. Hello. - Are you serious?

2415
01:30:56,527 --> 01:30:58,262
- Hey, long time, no see. - Hello.

2416
01:30:58,563 --> 01:30:59,964
Hey, Happy New Year.

2417
01:30:59,964 --> 01:31:01,499
- Hey, Haha. - You can't do this. Hold on.

2418
01:31:01,499 --> 01:31:03,267
- You ordered hot Americano, right? - Yes.

2419
01:31:03,267 --> 01:31:05,436
I need to wake up.

2420
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,905
What did the customer who just walked in order?

2421
01:31:08,473 --> 01:31:09,674
Hot Americano.

2422
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:11,743
(He's brazen.)

2423
01:31:12,009 --> 01:31:13,578
- What is this? - What do you mean?

2424
01:31:13,578 --> 01:31:15,213
Are we going to play dirty?

2425
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:16,714
Is it ready?

2426
01:31:16,814 --> 01:31:18,483
- Seriously? - Let me pay for this.

2427
01:31:18,483 --> 01:31:19,817
No, no. Let me pay for this.

2428
01:31:19,817 --> 01:31:21,586
- Why don't you take a seat? - Seriously?

2429
01:31:21,652 --> 01:31:23,054
But seriously, why are you here?

2430
01:31:23,054 --> 01:31:25,223
- I needed coffee. - I can't believe this.

2431
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:26,491
Where are you coming from?

2432
01:31:26,557 --> 01:31:28,292
I was at home. I'm on my way to...

2433
01:31:28,292 --> 01:31:29,827
He said he always comes to this cafe.

2434
01:31:29,827 --> 01:31:31,295
I'm a regular here.

2435
01:31:31,729 --> 01:31:33,030
I was sitting there...

2436
01:31:33,131 --> 01:31:35,266
and thought how someone could look so alike.

2437
01:31:35,266 --> 01:31:36,400
(That's what he thought initially.)

2438
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,136
Okay, fine. Fine.

2439
01:31:38,136 --> 01:31:40,238
(He enjoys his Americano on a Monday afternoon.)

2440
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:41,806
Fine. We're going all the way today.

2441
01:31:42,073 --> 01:31:43,841
- Let's duke this out. - Hey.

2442
01:31:43,941 --> 01:31:46,110
But it was hilarious. As soon as he walked in,

2443
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:47,278
I asked if it was him, and he said,

2444
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:48,713
"Hot Americano, please."

2445
01:31:49,847 --> 01:31:51,082
(Let's play this dirty then.)

2446
01:31:51,082 --> 01:31:52,383
Okay, okay.

2447
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:54,952
Didn't I come really quickly though?

2448
01:31:54,952 --> 01:31:56,687
- It took me about three minutes. - Are you serious?

2449
01:31:56,687 --> 01:31:57,922
Yes, you were quick.

2450
01:31:57,989 --> 01:31:59,123
This is so funny.

2451
01:31:59,123 --> 01:32:02,493
- I don't know what the last one is. - Geun Sik, you are the best.

2452
01:32:02,493 --> 01:32:03,628
Thank you.

2453
01:32:03,861 --> 01:32:05,029
- Why are you thanking me? - Have a good day.

2454
01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:06,297
- I'm a fan! - What's wrong?

2455
01:32:06,297 --> 01:32:08,166
- No, he said the line. - Thank you.

2456
01:32:08,166 --> 01:32:09,834
- Have a good day. - See you around.

2457
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:11,469
Please take your seats, and we'll do the last game.

2458
01:32:11,469 --> 01:32:13,404
- Okay, okay. I still have a shot. - All right.

2459
01:32:13,404 --> 01:32:15,072
- When did you call him? - I won five now.

2460
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:16,874
I feel nervous all of a sudden now.

2461
01:32:17,241 --> 01:32:19,977
- He may have more air time than me. - No, no.

2462
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:21,179
Don't you worry.

2463
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:23,114
- He might have more air time. - No, don't worry.

2464
01:32:23,114 --> 01:32:24,282
(With the score, 1 to 1, it's the last round.)

2465
01:32:24,282 --> 01:32:25,917
- We have to win. - Then for this game,

2466
01:32:25,917 --> 01:32:27,585
I might have an advantage.

2467
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:28,920
You don't know that. This is an important one.

2468
01:32:29,887 --> 01:32:33,324
- The last choice for Choice of 12. - Please.

2469
01:32:33,858 --> 01:32:37,428
A tape has been attached on the floor of this cafe.

2470
01:32:37,428 --> 01:32:39,831
- It's near the entrance. - Okay.

2471
01:32:40,231 --> 01:32:42,266
Guess the customer's foot over the line.

2472
01:32:42,266 --> 01:32:44,202
Choice 1, right foot. Choice 2, left foot.

2473
01:32:44,202 --> 01:32:45,469
Choice Three, the customer steps on the line.

2474
01:32:45,469 --> 01:32:47,505
(With which foot will the customer pass the line?)

2475
01:32:47,505 --> 01:32:48,606
Hold on. Please read the choices again.

2476
01:32:48,606 --> 01:32:50,508
Choice 1, right foot. Choice 2, left foot. Choice 3,

2477
01:32:50,508 --> 01:32:52,577
- the customer steps on the line. - My gosh. This is too hard.

2478
01:32:53,077 --> 01:32:54,212
We are at an advantage.

2479
01:32:54,345 --> 01:32:55,580
"The customer steps on the line."

2480
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:56,881
- "The customer steps on the line." - Okay.

2481
01:32:58,382 --> 01:32:59,851
Whatever you choose, we'll win.

2482
01:32:59,851 --> 01:33:01,652
- Right foot. - Right foot.

2483
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,754
"The customer steps on the line."

2484
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:07,191
- Haha, stop it now. - Wait.

2485
01:33:07,191 --> 01:33:08,526
Whom do you keep calling?

2486
01:33:08,526 --> 01:33:10,828
- Geun Sik, don't go yet. - What are you doing?

2487
01:33:10,828 --> 01:33:12,230
- Geun Sik. - What's wrong with this guy?

2488
01:33:12,230 --> 01:33:13,264
Geun Sik, don't leave yet.

2489
01:33:13,264 --> 01:33:14,699
- What's gotten into you? - All right, all right.

2490
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:17,735
- Okay. - Gosh, that was hilarious.

2491
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:19,403
"The customer steps on the line."

2492
01:33:20,938 --> 01:33:23,608
Most people are right-footed, so when they see the line,

2493
01:33:23,674 --> 01:33:26,444
they will be compelled to use their right foot.

2494
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:28,246
- Did you choose Choice Three? - Yes.

2495
01:33:28,246 --> 01:33:29,981
Whoever wins will get to take Choice Three.

2496
01:33:29,981 --> 01:33:32,216
Whoever loses will have to take the left foot.

2497
01:33:33,184 --> 01:33:35,086
- I don't want to lose now. - Usually...

2498
01:33:35,086 --> 01:33:36,454
Haha, I'm sorry.

2499
01:33:36,454 --> 01:33:38,422
- I mean it. - People usually step on the line.

2500
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:43,527
(When he walks in a natural manner, does he end up...)

2501
01:33:43,527 --> 01:33:44,896
(stepping on the line?)

2502
01:33:44,896 --> 01:33:46,497
This is bound to happen.

2503
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:48,432
This is a given. Seriously.

2504
01:33:49,066 --> 01:33:50,434
- Whatever happens, that's a given. - You...

2505
01:33:50,434 --> 01:33:52,236
Did you come in with your right foot?

2506
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:54,505
I came in with my right foot first.

2507
01:33:56,774 --> 01:33:58,442
Welcome. Please come in.

2508
01:33:58,643 --> 01:34:01,045
- Are you guys filming here? - You can come in. Please come in.

2509
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,446
I can come in?

2510
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:03,915
Come in.

2511
01:34:04,015 --> 01:34:05,683
Don't try to calculate which foot to use now.

2512
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:08,085
(Hesitating)

2513
01:34:08,085 --> 01:34:10,187
(Just come in.)

2514
01:34:10,187 --> 01:34:11,422
Don't think about it.

2515
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:13,057
- How do we do that? - No, no.

2516
01:34:13,457 --> 01:34:14,926
Whatever happens, people will step on it.

2517
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:16,661
- My gosh. - I agree.

2518
01:34:16,661 --> 01:34:17,962
- Okay. - That is the right choice.

2519
01:34:17,962 --> 01:34:20,531
(Will the next customer step on it like Kwang Soo's prediction?)

2520
01:34:21,432 --> 01:34:22,900
- They have to just cross the line. - Okay!

2521
01:34:23,634 --> 01:34:24,936
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2522
01:34:27,939 --> 01:34:29,941
(Haha: left foot, Kwang Soo: on the line)

2523
01:34:29,941 --> 01:34:31,208
- Then I get the left foot. - Yes.

2524
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,543
- Okay. - All right.

2525
01:34:32,777 --> 01:34:33,945
I'm almost there!

2526
01:34:33,945 --> 01:34:36,280
If I win this game, it's a miracle. It will be incredible.

2527
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,848
Haha, it's either the customer steps on it or uses the right foot.

2528
01:34:37,848 --> 01:34:39,417
- Your chance is slim. - That's right.

2529
01:34:39,417 --> 01:34:40,751
To be honest, I'm not even nervous.

2530
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:45,723
(All they need to do is wait for the next customer.)

2531
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:50,094
He's coming in. He's coming.

2532
01:34:50,561 --> 01:34:52,296
- Customers are here. - Customers are here.

2533
01:34:52,296 --> 01:34:54,532
(At this moment, two guys walk into the cafe.)

2534
01:34:56,367 --> 01:34:59,437
(At this point, he will either use his left foot or step on the line.)

2535
01:34:59,437 --> 01:35:00,438
Customers are here.

2536
01:35:00,438 --> 01:35:03,808
(Who will be the victor?)

2537
01:35:03,908 --> 01:35:05,643
(Shortly)

2538
01:35:05,643 --> 01:35:07,545
(The last story with Eccentric Master)

2539
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:09,947
(Living with the master still surprises them.)

2540
01:35:09,947 --> 01:35:12,016
(His preferences are unapproachable and incomprehensible.)

2541
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:13,351
(What have I just eaten?)

2542
01:35:13,517 --> 01:35:15,386
(And above all,)

2543
01:35:15,386 --> 01:35:17,755
(the master delivers a heavy blow.)

2544
01:35:17,755 --> 01:35:19,056
Your minds are...

2545
01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:21,492
("All the Butlers" is coming up soon.)

2546
01:35:21,492 --> 01:35:23,060
He's coming in. He's coming.

2547
01:35:23,694 --> 01:35:25,429
- Customers are here. - Customers are here.

2548
01:35:25,429 --> 01:35:27,698
(At this moment, two guys walk into the cafe.)

2549
01:35:29,467 --> 01:35:32,603
(At this point, he will either use his left foot or step on the line.)

2550
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:33,671
Customers are here.

2551
01:35:33,671 --> 01:35:37,074
(Who will be the victor?)

2552
01:35:40,211 --> 01:35:43,214
(He stepped on the line!)

2553
01:35:45,349 --> 01:35:48,352
(Just as Kwang Soo predicted, he steps on the line.)

2554
01:35:51,522 --> 01:35:53,724
(He's in despair.)

2555
01:35:53,724 --> 01:35:55,126
(Justice is served!)

2556
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:56,360
- Hello. - Welcome.

2557
01:35:57,261 --> 01:35:59,096
The third choice is...

2558
01:35:59,296 --> 01:36:00,531
stepping on the line.

2559
01:36:00,531 --> 01:36:02,033
(Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob win in the end.)

2560
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,436
(Yes! This is going to be my year!)

2561
01:36:05,569 --> 01:36:07,671
(He's frustrated and can't believe what just happened.)

2562
01:36:07,671 --> 01:36:10,041
Kwang Soo, who won the mission, will be given 20 ddakjis.

2563
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,409
And Sang Yeob...

2564
01:36:11,409 --> 01:36:13,110
will receive a small gift that we've prepared.

2565
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,746
That's right. You deserve this gift.

2566
01:36:15,746 --> 01:36:17,915
Usually, stepping on the line means you are out.

2567
01:36:17,915 --> 01:36:18,916
(He holds a grudge.)

2568
01:36:18,916 --> 01:36:20,551
(This wraps up the mission with ddakjis.)

2569
01:36:20,551 --> 01:36:22,119
(However, the battle for TV rating notice begins now!)

2570
01:36:22,119 --> 01:36:23,187
(Next week)

2571
01:36:23,387 --> 01:36:25,456
(It's not over until it's over?)

2572
01:36:25,456 --> 01:36:28,292
(The war isn't over. It's a team match now!)

2573
01:36:28,359 --> 01:36:29,994
(Are you still clueless? It's an individual match in the end.)

2574
01:36:29,994 --> 01:36:31,462
I have to win by all means.

2575
01:36:31,729 --> 01:36:34,698
(They will only get 5 seconds.)

2576
01:36:34,698 --> 01:36:37,034
(Their unprecedented passion to become the center of the clip)

2577
01:36:37,034 --> 01:36:38,769
(Or is it their energy?)

2578
01:36:38,769 --> 01:36:41,238
Let's go, my story under the sea!

2579
01:36:41,238 --> 01:36:43,207
(And)

2580
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,776
(Finally, their imagination...)

2581
01:36:45,776 --> 01:36:52,149
(comes true.)

2582
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:54,885
(Which member will win?)
