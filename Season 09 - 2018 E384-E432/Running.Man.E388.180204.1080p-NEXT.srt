1
00:00:02,015 --> 00:00:08,750
(Jeju Island, the dreamland, is everlastingly exotic.)

2
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:13,250
- Hello. - Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,280
- Hi. - Hello.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,920
- Hello. - Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:16,235 --> 00:00:19,020
Did you sleep well? Good morning. Hey, Mi Yeon.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,160
- Hi. - Hello.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,820
- Hi. - Morning, everyone.

8
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,830
- Hello. - Hi.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,560
It's been a while since we last filmed in Jeju Island,

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,370
but it's snowing hard here, and there's a strong gust of wind.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,640
- It's hailing. - Just in case...

12
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,910
(The biting gust of wind pierces from the morning.)

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,210
(On top of that, it's hailing hard.)

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,750
He's worried that the flights might be canceled.

15
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:45,450
The producer told me that we were going to start our shoot early...

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,050
- because he had another shoot next. - That's right.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,520
- If it's canceled, it'd be bad. - Right.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,090
Seok Jin was feeling nervous and asked him this question quietly.

19
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:56,530
"Chul Min, can I go poop?"

20
00:00:57,805 --> 00:00:59,360
Seok Jin asked Chul Min that given the current state?

21
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,970
Why would he ask for permission to poop?

22
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:03,070
- My goodness. - It's because we had to hurry.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,430
You could've just gone without asking.

24
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,800
- Seok Jin. Seriously. - Even kids go without asking.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,540
- You're over 50 years old now. - It's because we have to hurry.

26
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:12,140
How could you ask someone younger than you for permission?

27
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:13,910
- Hey. - Would you not poop if he said no?

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,180
- The entire staff were waiting. - My goodness.

29
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,620
- No one has done that to poop. - Seriously.

30
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,720
Today's race is a partner race called Rule of Collection.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,260
(Rule of Collection)

32
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:30,190
You'll receive a black pig gift set for the winning prize.

33
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,830
- Okay. Let's win this. - Black pig.

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,830
Jeju Island is famous for that.

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,760
You will compete for the black pig gift set and the water bomb.

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,270
- Water bomb? - Water bomb? With today's weather?

37
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,710
It's hailing today.

38
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:45,070
(The water bomb with the biting wind...)

39
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,480
(and the high-end, black pig gift set are at stake for the race.)

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,810
First of all, let us present you female guests who have flown...

41
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,350
- all the way here to join the race. - It must've taken a lot of effort.

42
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,850
- All right. - Yes, I agree.

43
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,290
Please come on out.

44
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:58,190
- Come out, angels. - Please come on out!

45
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,760
I'm so thankful they came here.

46
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,060
(Wait, this song is...)

47
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,260
Lyrics go, "It's the night I want to spend with you".

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,030
("Good Time" by Cleo)

49
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,200
(It's the night I want to spend with you)

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,300
- This is her song. - With you

51
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,800
Here she comes.

52
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,430
(It's So Min's song.)

53
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
It's So Min?

54
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,510
(She sang it in her school days.)

55
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:16,140
(She dances like she's back in school.)

56
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,880
Why is she circling her hands?

57
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,380
- I see Ji Hyo. - So Min.

58
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,480
Did you see Ji Hyo? She walked out and went like this.

59
00:02:23,225 --> 00:02:25,410
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - She's a ghost.

60
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,250
(A shadowy ghost is behind So Min.)

61
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,280
- What's up with her? - So Min!

62
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,620
I didn't know, but we were supposed to come out together.

63
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,890
- Really? - Yes.

64
00:02:31,965 --> 00:02:33,390
- Hurry. - What's going on?

65
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,630
I saw you dancing right away when the song was played.

66
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:38,730
(I couldn't help it. It's my favorite song.)

67
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,430
Ji Hyo looks like she's going camping today.

68
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:44,730
I bundled up because it's snowing a lot in Jeju Island.

69
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,110
- You don't dress up for us anymore. - She doesn't care anymore.

70
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,270
She looks like a lumberjack.

71
00:02:49,615 --> 00:02:52,210
You're the one to talk. Look at you. Are you in the army or what?

72
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,140
(She gets infuriated.)

73
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,480
- Fine. I'm in the service. - Are you?

74
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,820
- Yes, I'm in the army. - Go fulfill your military duty.

75
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,080
No, his jacket is the carrot, and his hat is the root of it.

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,280
(No, his jacket is the carrot, and his hat is the root of it.)

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,090
What? The root of a carrot? Don't you dare call me that!

78
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,850
I was talking about your hat.

79
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,690
- Stop it. - Watch every word, So Min.

80
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:11,060
- We should bring in another guest. - Here we go.

81
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,160
- We are just getting started. - Okay.

82
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,370
- Can you still smell my cologne? - Yes.

83
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,570
What is happening? It's a quiet song.

84
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,030
(The entrance song is quite calm.)

85
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,070
What?

86
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,340
(Who is the first female guest?)

87
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:25,270
(A tall, multitalented actress)

88
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,310
- That's Lee Da Hee. - Really?

89
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,310
(Lee Da Hee, a tall, multitalented actress)

90
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:33,620
(Her build is superior, but her acting is more superior.)

91
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,320
(She showed her superiority on variety shows too.)

92
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,660
- I haven't seen you in ages. - Hey, long time no see.

93
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,820
- Hey. - Do you know each other?

94
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,560
- We've met a long time ago. - Of course.

95
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,530
- How do you know each other? - A long time ago, Da Hee...

96
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,800
was on "Open Your Heart" or a program similar to that.

97
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,370
- Weren't you on variety shows? - Wait, so...

98
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,200
- I haven't met you. - Really? We haven't?

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,070
(He's flustered.)

100
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,140
- What's the matter with him? - Why do you pretend you know her?

101
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,850
- He talked like we'd met, - I was just welcoming her.

102
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,150
- but I've never met him. - It sounds like you've been well.

103
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,690
You got taller.

104
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:09,350
- What's wrong with him? - She said she'd never met you.

105
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,050
I remember skipping ropes with you.

106
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,090
- Skipping ropes? Come on. - We even played the marble game.

107
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:18,060
- Da Hee has joined us. Who's next? - Great!

108
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,030
(They're expectant.)

109
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:22,000
- Okay. - What's this song?

110
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,170
Wait, the song sounds a bit...

111
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,530
(She shows up with a trendy song.)

112
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,140
- Who is it? - It's Koo Ha Ra.

113
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:28,610
- It's Koo Ha Ra. - Koo Ha Ra!

114
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:32,010
(She's the cute and sexy fairy of the Korean Wave.)

115
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,540
(Unexpectedly, she's an athletic singer with a strong will to win.)

116
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,610
Kwang Soo, it's Koo Ha Ra! It's Ha Ra!

117
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,810
- My gosh. - What's going on with you?

118
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,650
- Hey. - Why? Do you like her?

119
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
Do you like her?

120
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,650
(Her return has shaken the fans.)

121
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,450
- Ha Ra. - It's been so long, Ha Ra.

122
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,820
- No way. - It's Ha Ra.

123
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:48,360
- Long time, no see. - My gosh, it's Koo Ha Ra.

124
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,030
- It's nice to see you all. - How have you been?

125
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,630
It's been years, Ha Ra. I think Se Chan is a big fan.

126
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,760
- I'm a big fan. - Really?

127
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,270
- He's over the moon. - I was so shocked.

128
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,100
- Since when were you her fan? - Ever since she was in Kara.

129
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,640
- Really? - Yes.

130
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,170
- We have amazing guests today. - Seriously.

131
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,940
- I agree. - What's going on today?

132
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,380
- The airport must've been hectic. - It's been years, Ha Ra.

133
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,480
- Let's bring in the next guest. - Okay.

134
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:12,250
(The entrance song is hip.)

135
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,650
(Did a hip guest join the show?)

136
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,320
- Seor In A! - Seor In A!

137
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,860
(Seor In A, a rising star in the limelight)

138
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,720
- Seor In A is an actress. - Seor In A.

139
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,790
(Seor In A, a rising star in the limelight)

140
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,900
(She is the super rookie of the year who was searched the most online.)

141
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,540
Long time, no see!

142
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:31,400
(He pretends to know her too.)

143
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,670
Did you say, "Long time, no see"?

144
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,840
- I didn't see you since the awards. - Again?

145
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,170
- Did you see her at the awards? - Yes.

146
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,280
- We have one last guest. - We won't interview her?

147
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,650
- All right. Come on out! - It's Mina.

148
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,650
She's in Gugudan.

149
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,910
- Gugudan! - Long time, no see!

150
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,910
She's in Gugudan.

151
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,120
(She's the cutie of Gugudan.)

152
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,120
- Awesome. - Yes, dance for us!

153
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,820
- This is incredible! - We have an idol singer!

154
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,160
- She's much better. - She dances much better.

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,260
(Mina, cutie of Gugudan)

156
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,400
She's excellent.

157
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,560
(She is a member of Gugudan and released her own album.)

158
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,000
(Mina, the refreshing singer, is charming the music industry.)

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,970
I memorized the multiplication tables a lot in elementary school.

160
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,910
(He makes a pun with the name, Gugudan.)

161
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,270
What's gotten into him today?

162
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,810
- What's wrong? - He's acting so lame.

163
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,680
- I'm a huge fan. I'm serious. - That's enough.

164
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,180
You're my only favorite idol singer.

165
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,250
- I'm serious. - Four guests have gathered here.

166
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,980
- Right. - Welcome, everyone!

167
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,420
(We welcome you with passion.)

168
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:26,390
- Let's interview them one by one. - Okay.

169
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,860
First up is Lee Da Hee!

170
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,030
(Let's start with Lee Da Hee.)

171
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,270
Da Hee debuted in 2002 as a model.

172
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:35,830
This is the 17th year of her career.

173
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,430
That's impressive.

174
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,200
That's incredible.

175
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:42,740
You were recently on "The Law of Jungle".

176
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,010
Wasn't it hard?

177
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:46,540
- I had fun. - Really?

178
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,580
I want to go again.

179
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,280
She is picking her nose!

180
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,250
(She is flustered.)

181
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,620
She is picking her nose!

182
00:06:57,235 --> 00:06:58,950
What is wrong with him?

183
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,160
She scratched her nose.

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,190
She didn't pick her nose.

185
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:05,260
- Why would Da Hee pick her nose? - For goodness' sake.

186
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,400
Okay. I am sorry.

187
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,040
I am wearing an angora top, and fur keeps getting on my face.

188
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,900
Then did you really pick your nose?

189
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:14,470
No.

190
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,470
(She is flustered for the 2nd time.)

191
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,610
Did fur go into her nose?

192
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,110
- She picked fur out of her nose. - Really?

193
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,310
Fur went into her nose.

194
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:22,740
(This is a unique way to treat a guest.)

195
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,810
The thing is,

196
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,980
both Kwang Soo and Da Hee debuted as models.

197
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,950
Have you met her before?

198
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,890
No, this is my first time meeting her.

199
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,330
Didn't you work as a model?

200
00:07:32,335 --> 00:07:33,760
Da Hee, tell us.

201
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,930
I didn't get to work much as a model.

202
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,990
Kwang Soo, you were famous.

203
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,300
- No. - No?

204
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,530
- Not really. - Really?

205
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:44,170
I joined the fashion show only once.

206
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,100
- I did, too. - Really?

207
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,540
- Me, too. - Really?

208
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,240
Isn't that more of an experience?

209
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
(Isn't that more of an experience?)

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,510
When did you debut?

211
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,110
Don't be so harsh.

212
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,750
- Don't be so harsh. - It's not like that.

213
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,880
What is up with you today?

214
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,110
I can't believe you.

215
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,720
(Pictures from the days they experienced a modeling career)

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
What is up with you today?

217
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,020
Kwang Soo is just a tall man.

218
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,850
- He is just a tall man. - Don't say you were a model.

219
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,050
- Stop it. - You weren't much of a model.

220
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,660
I heard that Da Hee can sing.

221
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,100
- Is she a good singer? - She is a good singer.

222
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,290
- Let's hear her sing. - Da Hee.

223
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,960
I heard that you can sing.

224
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,130
When we ask the guests to sing,

225
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,130
- they usually go, "No, no." - That's right.

226
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,470
I don't get many chances to sing.

227
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,240
- This is a good opportunity. - Really?

228
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
- That's great. - Please sing a song.

229
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,540
Most guests hate it.

230
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:28,310
(Breathing out)

231
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,350
Please be quiet. Let's hear her sing.

232
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,450
It's very

233
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,920
Why don't you sing some other time?

234
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,390
(Considerate)

235
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,830
- Your throat is in a bad condition. - No, it's in a good condition.

236
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,060
What was that?

237
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,030
Is it because of the fur?

238
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,230
Could it be because of your angora top?

239
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,600
Why don't you jump to the chorus?

240
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,500
Take us to the highlight.

241
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:51,640
I can't stop her when she wants to sing.

242
00:08:51,675 --> 00:08:53,370
In 2, 3.

243
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:56,540
The act of waiting

244
00:08:56,585 --> 00:08:57,770
What should I do?

245
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,010
(What should I do?)

246
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,450
You failed!

247
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,010
- You failed! - Your throat is in a bad condition.

248
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,520
Isn't her participation in the OST more of an experience?

249
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,990
(Isn't her participation in the OST more of an experience?)

250
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,150
Don't say that.

251
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,120
That's no way to treat a guest!

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
- I am sorry. - Stop it already.

253
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,000
- Do you want to see me angry? - I am sorry.

254
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,030
This isn't the right time.

255
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,930
The next guest is Seor In A.

256
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,430
(The next guest is Seor In A.)

257
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,330
In A tends to throw...

258
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,500
- some profound words... - What are those words?

259
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,140
without thinking.

260
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,640
- Those words have a ripple effect. - What are those words?

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,080
Here are some examples.

262
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:36,140
"Actors are like nails."

263
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,550
- Nails? - Why?

264
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,820
I can't even laugh.

265
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,680
Let's hear her reason.

266
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,080
You grow nails.

267
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,350
You cut nails.

268
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,320
"Actors are like nails."

269
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:49,030
You can cut the parts you don't like...

270
00:09:49,265 --> 00:09:52,000
and paint them in colors of your choice.

271
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,870
(They are cringing.)

272
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:00,970
I am sorry, but do you still have MySpace?

273
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:02,700
Don't say anything.

274
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,980
Seriously.

275
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,170
That's no way to treat a guest!

276
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,440
I got goosebumps.

277
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,050
That's no way to treat a guest!

278
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,220
- That's... - I am sorry, In A.

279
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,320
She must have had sentimental posts.

280
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,050
Exactly how old are you?

281
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,290
How old are you?

282
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,050
I heard you were good at sports.

283
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,600
In A,

284
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,230
- you learned taekwondo, right? - Jiu jitsu?

285
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,630
- Yes. - Did you learn jiu jitsu as well?

286
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,470
I am learning jiu jitsu right now. I learned taekwondo in childhood.

287
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:29,060
Are you good at kicks?

288
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,600
In A, can you break wooden boards?

289
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,830
- Yes. - Would it be okay?

290
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,200
Kwang Soo, please hold it up.

291
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,510
She will kick it.

292
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,740
- In A. - Yes.

293
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:39,440
(Kicking)

294
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,240
My goodness.

295
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,480
(It hurts.)

296
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
She kicked my hands.

297
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,050
(I can't believe you kicked my hand, too.)

298
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,060
She kicked my hand.

299
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:53,090
- Are you okay? - She kicked his hand.

300
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,790
Did I really kick your hand?

301
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,060
- It shouldn't be too painful. - It's okay.

302
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,530
She should have kicked the middle.

303
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,060
- Look. - Are you okay?

304
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,370
She should have kicked the middle.

305
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,100
- Look. - She kicked his hand.

306
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:05,700
- I think she did. - She kicked his hand all right.

307
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,700
The end broke.

308
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,170
Why did you kick his hand?

309
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,810
- I must have aimed too high. - She obviously kicked his hand.

310
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,270
Kwang Soo is the one at fault.

311
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,040
He should have held up the wooden board higher.

312
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,880
- In A has long legs. - That's right.

313
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,250
- He should have held it up higher. - You are saying it's my fault...

314
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,380
- for getting kicked. - That's right.

315
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,260
- I got kicked. - It's your fault.

316
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:26,190
In A has long legs. You should have held it up higher.

317
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,290
(I am sorry, Kwang Soo.)

318
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,760
I want to see a jiu jitsu demonstration.

319
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,530
- Can you show us? - An arm bar.

320
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,130
- Then I will have to twist someone. - Really?

321
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,530
Why don't you twist Se Chan?

322
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,470
- Me? - Yes.

323
00:11:37,675 --> 00:11:38,840
I mean...

324
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:39,970
Let's do it this way.

325
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,700
Think of yourself as a molester.

326
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,410
- That's a good idea. - Yes.

327
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,140
- What should he do? - I love this kind of a set-up.

328
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
It suits him.

329
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,510
When I walk,

330
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,640
put your arm around me in a sneaky way.

331
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,910
Okay. That's good.

332
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,820
You can use the trick in real life.

333
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,720
Everyone should learn.

334
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
- He looks like a molester. - Go.

335
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,690
(What kind of self-defense technique will the jiu jitsu master show?)

336
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,000
She simply pushed him.

337
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,360
(She twists his arm...)

338
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,740
(and pushes him.)

339
00:12:10,915 --> 00:12:14,000
Anyone can do that.

340
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
- It's a simple push. - Hold on.

341
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,570
(It's a simple push.)

342
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,040
Anyone can do that.

343
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,880
This isn't jiu jitsu.

344
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,110
She simply threw a fit.

345
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,250
Try it on me.

346
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,280
- It's jiu jitsu. - She simply threw a fit.

347
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,480
Anyone can do this.

348
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,380
- Is this jiu jitsu? - Listen.

349
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,750
- What was that? - It's a useful tip.

350
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,660
- Didn't she simply throw a fit? - What do you think you are doing?

351
00:12:31,735 --> 00:12:33,090
Let's talk to the next guest.

352
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,420
- The next guest is Mina. - Mina!

353
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,530
- Mina is the best. - It's Mina.

354
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,930
- She is the best. - She is the best.

355
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,960
- In 2016, - I love the way her eyes crinkle.

356
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,100
she debuted as a member of I.O.I.

357
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,470
She now works diligently as a member of Gugudan.

358
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,470
I heard that...

359
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,970
Mina prepared a specialty at home.

360
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,080
Really?

361
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:54,180
- You did that for Running Man. - That's incredible.

362
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,150
The members told me not to show it.

363
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,650
What did you prepare?

364
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,450
- A voice impression. - A voice impression.

365
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,150
- A voice impression. - Although I practiced hard,

366
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,550
- the members told me not to do it. - Really?

367
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,860
Whom do you imitate?

368
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:06,590
Well,

369
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,100
- I imitate the rapper, Jolly V. - Jolly V.

370
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,830
(Can she do a voice impression of Jolly V?)

371
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,960
(She covers her mouth and imitates shyly.)

372
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,300
I did this.

373
00:13:15,745 --> 00:13:18,170
It becomes a specialty if you don't cover your mouth.

374
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:20,000
- You shouldn't cover your mouth. - Really?

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,140
- Please try again. - I will give it another try.

376
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:28,280
(She shows her face.)

377
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,010
That's hilarious.

378
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,080
- Mina, that's the way to do it. - That's hilarious.

379
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,920
- Her mouth looked funny. - For a successful specialty,

380
00:13:33,925 --> 00:13:35,750
you shouldn't cover your mouth.

381
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,220
(Jae Seok's coaching leaves the student satisfied.)

382
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,690
She is cute.

383
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:41,730
(Does he think it's cute?)

384
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:43,490
(She does it in a depressing way.)

385
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,390
How do you do it?

386
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,330
Try, "You jerk."

387
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,170
Do a voice impression of Joo Hyun.

388
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:50,770
For goodness' sake.

389
00:13:50,845 --> 00:13:52,600
Stay out of it, you jerk.

390
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,670
(She is good at this.)

391
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:56,640
That's really annoying.

392
00:13:57,355 --> 00:13:59,210
"Stay out of it, you jerk."

393
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,180
The next guest is a singer who debuted 10 years ago.

394
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,410
What a surprise!

395
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,280
Koo Ha Ra!

396
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:06,890
Koo Ha Ra!

397
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:09,020
Ha Ra said this...

398
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,420
back in the days.

399
00:14:10,865 --> 00:14:12,960
Do you remember saying this?

400
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:16,020
"I want to get married at the age of 36."

401
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,900
- 36? - 36?

402
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,830
Do you think differently now?

403
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,600
(What is your stand on it now?)

404
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:25,430
(Ha Ra wanted to get married at the age of 36.)

405
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,370
(Does she still wish the same?)

406
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,870
I don't want to get married anymore.

407
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,680
(I don't want to get married anymore.)

408
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,980
Those jerks!

409
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:38,250
Those jerks!

410
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,450
(Who hurt her?)

411
00:14:40,495 --> 00:14:42,520
Kwang Soo, stop it.

412
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,850
- Don't make assumptions. - Okay.

413
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,090
- It was all in my imagination. - You must have been hurt.

414
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,360
- It was all in my imagination. - For goodness' sake.

415
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,820
Women always meet a nice man...

416
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,130
- after pieces of trash. - Stop it.

417
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,230
(He makes assumptions.)

418
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,490
- Stop it. - It's like that.

419
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,700
Stop it.

420
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:55,730
- It's exhausting, right? - Yes.

421
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,030
- I am sorry, Ha Ra. - It's okay.

422
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,870
I think I will have fun today.

423
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,740
(It's thanks to the male members.)

424
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,910
That's right.

425
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,410
I think she will say...

426
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,010
what you said during the flight.

427
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:09,610
"Those jerks."

428
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,180
(The members of Running Man, those jerks.)

429
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,150
"The members of Running Man, those jerks."

430
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,820
(Let's hope she won't get hurt by the members of Running Man.)

431
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,490
"Those jerks."

432
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,060
I don't know whom those words will direct.

433
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,070
Now, let's choose the partners...

434
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:28,900
for these six women.

435
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,960
This is nerve-wracking.

436
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,710
The rules are simple.

437
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:35,600
Each female member will come out...

438
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,840
and say, "I like someone who is..."

439
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,340
If the condition applies to you, step forward.

440
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,380
When you do that, you have to squat walk.

441
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,650
If your hands leave your ears, you are out.

442
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,590
If your hands stay on your ears even if you fall, you are in.

443
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,250
What if your hands leave...

444
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,350
with your ears?

445
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,660
(What if your hands leave with your ears?)

446
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,730
- What? - What happens then?

447
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,230
Your hands leave with your ears.

448
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,330
- Then you are out. - You are out.

449
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,540
I will be careful not to do that.

450
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,530
- We will need strong ears. - You are out...

451
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,600
- if you hold your torn ears. - You are out.

452
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,140
(Let's decide on the partners.)

453
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,780
- Everyone, - Yes.

454
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:12,410
once you reach this zone,

455
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,220
the woman will make a decision.

456
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,110
- The woman will make a decision. - That's right.

457
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,520
This is nerve-wracking.

458
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,550
Which one...

459
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:21,720
should we start with?

460
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,820
Who wants to go first?

461
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,450
- Me. - Koo Ha Ra.

462
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,390
(Ha Ra volunteers.)

463
00:16:27,035 --> 00:16:28,760
This is like the final round.

464
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,190
- She's very confident. - Gosh.

465
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,690
- From the start... - It's like finals.

466
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,170
From the start...

467
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:34,330
It's already beginning.

468
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,830
Say what you look for in your partner.

469
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,340
- Okay. - Okay.

470
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:40,510
- She's so relaxed. - Yes.

471
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:41,670
She's a veteran.

472
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,270
She came back very relaxed.

473
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:44,570
Ready,

474
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,910
start.

475
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:47,210
I...

476
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,810
(What does Ha Ra look for in her partner?)

477
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,350
(I...)

478
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:58,750
(What is her dream partner like?)

479
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,130
I want someone in a black outfit.

480
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:06,630
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, Haha)

481
00:17:08,975 --> 00:17:11,840
(Those in black squat walk forward.)

482
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:14,870
(Black?)

483
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,580
(I'm wearing black inside.)

484
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm not wearing any black.

485
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,780
(Those not in black become restless.)

486
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,320
(I'm not wearing black either.)

487
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,580
(Wait, my undershirt is black.)

488
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,750
That's black. Take your sweater off.

489
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:31,820
Good.

490
00:17:32,365 --> 00:17:33,560
That's black.

491
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,990
You're late.

492
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,730
- It's over. - Hold on.

493
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:39,160
(Curious)

494
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,970
- Your hands are off your ears. - Oh, my.

495
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:46,040
- It's over. - I'm wearing black.

496
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:48,800
Oh, my.

497
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,540
- I'm wearing black. - It's over.

498
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,310
It's over.

499
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,280
Please turn around on the count of three.

500
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,010
1, 2, 3.

501
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,250
(It's time to see the candidates.)

502
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:01,890
(Many came.)

503
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:03,890
- Ha Ra. - Ha Ra.

504
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,890
- Ha Ra. - Please push the ones...

505
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,390
you don't like one by one.

506
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,390
1, 2...

507
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,830
(The candidates are Se Chan, Jong Kook, Haha, and Seok Jin.)

508
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:17,270
(You can push the ones you don't like out.)

509
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,330
1, 2, 3.

510
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,780
(Sorry, Seok Jin.)

511
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,370
She hit his head first.

512
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,050
- Next. - Well...

513
00:18:28,585 --> 00:18:31,010
- Next. - Kwang Soo, I still have a chance.

514
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:35,590
(Excited)

515
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:41,860
(Se Chan, Ha Ra's old fan, was so happy to see her today.)

516
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:45,760
(Will Se Chan make it to the finals?)

517
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,070
Haha.

518
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,770
- Haha. - Do you need help?

519
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,210
(Haha is eliminated.)

520
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:56,070
(I'm sorry.)

521
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,640
- Now... - Ha Ra, see what happens.

522
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,080
(Petty)

523
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:02,650
- See what happens. - Haha.

524
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:04,380
- See if your cold will go away. - Exactly.

525
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:06,320
Oh, my.

526
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:09,320
- Se Chan versus Jong Kook. - Se Chan, you can do this.

527
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,460
Ha Ra.

528
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,320
It's finals.

529
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,790
I've made it to the finals.

530
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,190
(I've made it to finals.)

531
00:19:16,665 --> 00:19:20,160
(Ha Ra, Se Chan's crush for years, is right in front of him.)

532
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,570
(But his opponent is Jong Kook.)

533
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,700
(Whom will Ha Ra choose?)

534
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:27,500
Okay!

535
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,400
(Se Chan is eliminated.)

536
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,010
I knew it. What was I hoping for?

537
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,740
- Okay. - You made it to second place.

538
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,210
I knew it.

539
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,250
Of course.

540
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,280
- Jong Kook and Ha Ra. - Okay.

541
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:40,680
Okay.

542
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,060
Next, So Min.

543
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:44,550
Me? Should I go first?

544
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,920
(It's So Min's turn now.)

545
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,160
(Uninterested)

546
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,430
I feel no excitement at all.

547
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:55,130
- Say exactly what you want. - Say what you want first.

548
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,800
I want...

549
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:01,140
someone very generous.

550
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,470
(I want someone very generous.)

551
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,470
- I'm very sensitive these days. - I'm so petty.

552
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,610
- I'm really petty. - I'm so petty...

553
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,610
- that my wife complains about it. - I'm petty.

554
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,410
- I'm so petty. - So Min.

555
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,950
(Forget it.)

556
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:17,390
- Oh, my. - This is how it works?

557
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:18,990
- We're all petty. - Can't you say something else?

558
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,920
- I'm petty. - I'm really petty.

559
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,290
I want...

560
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,460
(Second try)

561
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,400
I want someone handsome.

562
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,970
- I'm not handsome. - I'm ugly.

563
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:31,630
No one is handsome.

564
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,730
So Min.

565
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,400
(They try their best to look ugly.)

566
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,100
Look at Haha.

567
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,910
You guys are so mean.

568
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,840
(I can't believe them.)

569
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,380
- You'll have to wait. - Hey.

570
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,150
(Just give up.)

571
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,150
Are you serious?

572
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,220
- Try again later. - I can't give up.

573
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,650
Come on.

574
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,350
- I want... - Go back.

575
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,190
- I want. - Stop it.

576
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,490
I want someone short and old with a flat bottom and a pouty mouth.

577
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:03,070
(I want someone short and old, with a flat bottom and a pouty mouth.)

578
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:05,830
Stop it.

579
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,510
Calm down.

580
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,640
They're so mean.

581
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,240
This is how it works?

582
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,010
Unfortunately, So Min...

583
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,650
failed to find a partner.

584
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:18,910
It's Da Hee's turn now.

585
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,210
(Da Hee will find a partner.)

586
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,650
She and Kwang Soo will make a great team.

587
00:21:21,925 --> 00:21:23,480
Please say what you look for.

588
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,360
(What is Da Hee's dream partner like?)

589
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,830
I want someone not younger than me.

590
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:35,060
(Se Chan is younger than Da Hee.)

591
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,200
Hold on. Do you mean everyone except me?

592
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,400
That's right.

593
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,500
- Kwang Soo is your age. - That's okay.

594
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll just stay here.

595
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,210
(I'll just stay here.)

596
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,240
Don't take it personally.

597
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,310
You could have just said you wanted anyone but me.

598
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,810
- I mean... - Don't take it personally.

599
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,110
He welcomed all the guests...

600
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,380
- except me. - Is that why?

601
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,720
- He didn't welcome me. - I see.

602
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,250
All right.

603
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:57,850
Everyone except Se Chan.

604
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,320
Se Chan, you can still...

605
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,820
- try. - I can?

606
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,090
- It doesn't matter. - Of course.

607
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:05,700
Ready, start.

608
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:08,660
(It's time to choose.)

609
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,700
(Everyone welcomed Da Hee.)

610
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,340
(How many will be there?)

611
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,640
Da Hee, please turn around. 1, 2, 3.

612
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:20,110
(Only the one younger than her is here.)

613
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:22,810
(Cold)

614
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,420
Hold on.

615
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:27,580
(Why is he here?)

616
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,050
Hold on.

617
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,360
Hold on. This is just too much.

618
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,960
This is too much.

619
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:37,290
Da Hee. Hold on.

620
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,690
It's not like that.

621
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,800
She looked like Ha Jung Woo in "The Chaser".

622
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:46,100
(Is there a hammer or a club?)

623
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm hurt.

624
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,400
Seriously...

625
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,780
What is this?

626
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:53,040
You're not the only one who got hurt.

627
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,840
- Da Hee is hurt too. - She is?

628
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,150
You're both hurt.

629
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,110
Don't think we'll go for everyone.

630
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,580
We're hard to please.

631
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,260
We're very picky.

632
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:03,680
If I don't choose anyone now,

633
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,690
I might end up becoming...

634
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,760
- Seok Jin's partner, right? - Yes.

635
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,160
I don't want that.

636
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,230
(I don't want that.)

637
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,030
- So... - What's going on?

638
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,530
- What are you doing? - Hey.

639
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,930
Seok Jin didn't do anything.

640
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,670
- I don't like you. - What's wrong?

641
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,970
- So... - I don't like you.

642
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,870
- I can't believe her. - Seok Jin didn't do anything.

643
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,480
- I didn't do anything. - It's bad enough now,

644
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:26,250
but do you think it might get worse?

645
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,580
(Does it show?)

646
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,640
I don't like you.

647
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,850
She's the best.

648
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:32,210
If...

649
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,090
Da Hee pushes Se Chan out, they won't become a team.

650
00:23:36,095 --> 00:23:37,260
One,

651
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,150
two...

652
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,890
(Da Hee is cornered. Will she choose Se Chan?)

653
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,990
Three.

654
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:49,100
(Se Chan and Da Hee)

655
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:52,100
Anyway, Da Hee and...

656
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,540
Se Chan are a team now.

657
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,840
Next, In A.

658
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
- In A. - In A.

659
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,210
We're hard to please.

660
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,480
- We're picky. - We are.

661
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,420
- We know what we want. - Let's do this.

662
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:09,280
I want...

663
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,450
(I want...)

664
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,220
I want someone wearing a cap.

665
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,730
It's everyone.

666
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:19,830
- Oh, no. - What are you doing?

667
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,160
She's too easy.

668
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
She's opening up my heart.

669
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,470
- Should we go? - So Min changed the atmosphere.

670
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,630
- Right? - Completely.

671
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,970
- Ready... - What should we do?

672
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,540
- Should we go? - It's driving me crazy.

673
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,140
- Start. - Should we go?

674
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:35,240
(They move forward.)

675
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,350
They're moving.

676
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:38,380
(Kicking)

677
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,580
(Ji Hyo jumps in...)

678
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,850
(and kicks Haha away.)

679
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,020
What's happening?

680
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:45,760
Are you okay?

681
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,960
She kicked him in the jaw.

682
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,490
- You're eliminated. - Wait.

683
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,660
- What's with her? - You're eliminated.

684
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,660
A gangster wouldn't do that.

685
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,330
In A, turn around.

686
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,340
1, 2, 3.

687
00:24:58,475 --> 00:24:59,770
Peekaboo.

688
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,670
(Only you two?)

689
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,980
Haha had an accident on the way.

690
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:06,840
Ji Hyo won't leave me alone...

691
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,050
whenever we do couple games.

692
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:12,010
- You're mine. Don't do anything. - She's driving me crazy.

693
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,480
1, 2, 3. Push someone out.

694
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,250
- Push the one you don't like. - Push the one you don't like.

695
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:18,720
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

696
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:22,560
(Wait, it means...)

697
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,900
- What's this? - Unbelievable.

698
00:25:25,505 --> 00:25:26,760
- Wait. - What's happening?

699
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,300
- Do you want to try again? - Unbelievable.

700
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,470
Gosh.

701
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:32,670
(Irritated)

702
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,940
In A, please go back.

703
00:25:35,945 --> 00:25:39,070
- In A... - Kwang Soo thought he'd win.

704
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,240
- It's Mina's turn now. - Mina.

705
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,680
There will be a lot of competition.

706
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,320
Mina is...

707
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,880
Her smile is so pretty, right?

708
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,420
Please say what you look for.

709
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,990
I...

710
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:54,690
want someone wearing a shirt.

711
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,790
(I want someone wearing a shirt.)

712
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,030
A shirt?

713
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,830
(No one is wearing a shirt.)

714
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,300
- A shirt? - It's you.

715
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,510
Just say you want Jae Seok.

716
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,300
(Just say you want Jae Seok.)

717
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,410
Gosh.

718
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:13,010
You hurt our pride.

719
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:15,110
I can't find a shirt.

720
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:17,780
All I'm wearing is an undershirt.

721
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:19,010
This is...

722
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,220
It's too obvious whom she wants.

723
00:26:21,365 --> 00:26:22,580
Ready.

724
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,990
(There has been a lot of opposition.)

725
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,390
(But Mina wants only Jae Seok.)

726
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,560
(Mina is only loyal to Jae Seok with a collared shirt.)

727
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,960
(Did Jae Seok come?)

728
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,760
(She's disappointed.)

729
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,270
- What's going on? - He just put it on.

730
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,870
He wasn't wearing a collared shirt before.

731
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,400
- Why is she upset? - She's not.

732
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,740
- Am I that bad? - No.

733
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,970
It may be because she likes you.

734
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,570
- You weren't wearing a shirt. - "Am I that bad?"

735
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,910
- Am I that bad? - Listen.

736
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,010
(How can you react that way?)

737
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:53,720
(Kwang Soo was rejected when he borrowed a shirt from the staff.)

738
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:55,550
Listen.

739
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,450
- Listen. - He's discouraged.

740
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,590
Da Hee showed how she felt with her facial expression.

741
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,660
However, Mina...

742
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:05,490
(Her groaning explained her feelings.)

743
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,000
Please sit down.

744
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:11,670
- Mina, in 3, 2, 1. - The shirt looks borrowed.

745
00:27:12,015 --> 00:27:13,070
(Will you hold my hand?)

746
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,440
They become a couple.

747
00:27:15,815 --> 00:27:17,480
- Mina and Kwang Soo are together. - Yes.

748
00:27:18,115 --> 00:27:19,280
Come on.

749
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:20,850
Next is Ji Hyo.

750
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:23,380
Her partner is obvious.

751
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:26,980
However, we never know.

752
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,020
All right, Ji Hyo.

753
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,160
I can...

754
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:35,030
(He's nervous.)

755
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,490
I can make delicious food.

756
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,460
(What is she saying all of a sudden?)

757
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,330
- What do you mean? - What?

758
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,900
Are you awake yet?

759
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,400
You're not awake yet.

760
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,600
- Ji Hyo. - You keep saying that I'm old.

761
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,170
- Come on, Ji Hyo. - You keep saying that I'm old.

762
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,840
This is choosing your partner. You startled me.

763
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,970
Please answer again.

764
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,210
Tell us, Ji Hyo.

765
00:27:55,885 --> 00:27:58,580
I like men who don't wear glasses.

766
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:03,020
(Haha is the only one without glasses.)

767
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,020
It's Haha.

768
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:08,660
(Haha goes somewhere.)

769
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,860
You can't borrow other people's items from now on.

770
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,630
(He takes the camera director's glasses.)

771
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,370
Wait.

772
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:17,100
- You can't borrow things. - You can't.

773
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,200
It's not allowed.

774
00:28:19,075 --> 00:28:20,130
You can't do that.

775
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,470
(That's against the rules.)

776
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,770
You can't borrow from other people.

777
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,380
- You can't. - No.

778
00:28:24,715 --> 00:28:27,540
You can't borrow items from other people.

779
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,710
(He brings a permanent marker.)

780
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:30,480
Will you draw the glasses?

781
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,850
(He plans to draw him a tattoo.)

782
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,350
- Do it for me. - Really?

783
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,820
We aren't allowed to borrow.

784
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,890
We can't borrow any items.

785
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:38,750
(He starts to draw.)

786
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,820
It's done.

787
00:28:41,265 --> 00:28:44,260
(I have glasses on, Ji Hyo.)

788
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:49,230
(He even draws glasses with a permanent marker.)

789
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,700
Then I change my mind.

790
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,440
- To what? - Someone with glasses on.

791
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,470
Someone with glasses on?

792
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,540
(She wants a partner with glasses on.)

793
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:03,440
(Someone with glasses on?)

794
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,110
- Stop it. - May I change my mind to...

795
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,090
- someone with glasses? - He can't erase them.

796
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:08,920
If he meets the standard, he's required to come out.

797
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,720
- It's required. - Stop it.

798
00:29:10,795 --> 00:29:13,490
That's enough, Haha.

799
00:29:13,965 --> 00:29:17,160
If you have glasses on, you must come out.

800
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,560
(I took them off. It's all you.)

801
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,430
She's been my partner for weeks.

802
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,400
Ji Hyo!

803
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:25,070
Why do you find me so attractive?

804
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:29,340
Why me? I have two children, you punk.

805
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,840
- Stop it. - I have two children, you punk.

806
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,840
(Let me go.)

807
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,010
You punk.

808
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,750
You're full of charms.

809
00:29:35,155 --> 00:29:38,620
Start. You must come out.

810
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:40,550
(Wait a minute.)

811
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,550
What?

812
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,950
(In A suddenly intercepts him.)

813
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,950
- Take your hands off. - What?

814
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,120
Why won't you?

815
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:48,430
Wait, what's going on?

816
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:51,100
What do you want me to do?

817
00:29:51,135 --> 00:29:52,670
- She used a self-defense technique. - Self-defense.

818
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:53,730
That's self-defense.

819
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,630
That was a self-defense technique.

820
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,570
Did someone steal my partner?

821
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,100
My goodness.

822
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,200
(She pulls his hand away from his ear.)

823
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,570
- He let go of his hands. - He's eliminated.

824
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,140
(Haha is eliminated.)

825
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,110
- You must be happy, Haha. - What happened?

826
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:10,640
- Do you know what In A did? - Really?

827
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,980
Come back to your place.

828
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:13,950
Why did you save me suddenly?

829
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,150
(Haha and In A become partners.)

830
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:16,920
(Couples are formed.)

831
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,790
Everyone has a partner after some difficulties.

832
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:23,320
Here are the rules for Rule of Collection.

833
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,930
(Race for Rule of Collection officially starts.)

834
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:31,870
All partners pick a card numbered from 1 to 6.

835
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,870
The team whose total is the highest...

836
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,840
and the lowest win.

837
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,880
The highest and the lowest win.

838
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:41,180
Everyone except the winning two couples...

839
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,010
(The rest will get a water bomb.)

840
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,850
- Everyone else will get... - Everyone else?

841
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,280
a water bomb.

842
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,350
Only two couples can win.

843
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,750
Only two couples will survive.

844
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,290
The cards of the couple that comes in last will be revealed.

845
00:30:53,335 --> 00:30:56,430
(The cards of the couple that comes in last will be revealed.)

846
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:59,830
One person of the winning couple finds out who has a certain card.

847
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,360
- He may switch partners. - Switch partners?

848
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,700
(There's a chance to switch partners.)

849
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,870
Can you switch partners?

850
00:31:05,345 --> 00:31:07,740
- That's great. - We get to switch partners?

851
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,670
- My goodness. - That's great.

852
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,210
(What's the meaning behind your smile?)

853
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,580
I'm sorry.

854
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,140
(Wait, I'm sorry.)

855
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,280
Da Hee is finally smiling.

856
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,580
Da Hee looks so happy.

857
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,450
She's so excited.

858
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,920
She smiled very big.

859
00:31:24,025 --> 00:31:25,690
Did you get a shot of her face?

860
00:31:25,795 --> 00:31:27,900
Gosh, she finally smiles.

861
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:31,330
You must win to get a chance to switch partners.

862
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,390
- We must win? - We must win?

863
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,160
Only if we win.

864
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:37,600
It's time to select the number that will determine your fate.

865
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,040
The male partners will select the cards first.

866
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,110
Shall we?

867
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:43,170
This is...

868
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,070
(The total must be the highest or the lowest.)

869
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,070
The female partners may select them.

870
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,640
Is the highest or the lowest better?

871
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,280
That depends on my number.

872
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,450
- Is it the sum? - Yes.

873
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,180
- Let me see it. - It's a good number.

874
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,620
Isn't it good?

875
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,480
I'm not sure about mine.

876
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,350
The total must be the highest or the lowest.

877
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,620
That's right. Ji Hyo.

878
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,390
- I... - Let's show the card each.

879
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,530
(They don't show it to each other.)

880
00:32:05,605 --> 00:32:07,360
- We have a possibility. - We do.

881
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,470
(What will be the fate of these couples?)

882
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,470
- Let's go. - Clumsy.

883
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,200
- Slow cross. - Cross.

884
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,240
I think this is too small.

885
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:18,470
Your shirt color is different.

886
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,010
(Kwang Soo, your shirt color is different.)

887
00:32:21,025 --> 00:32:23,010
- What? - Something went wrong.

888
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,280
Did she break your heart already?

889
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,150
- He lost the couple shirt. - Right.

890
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,250
Stop teasing me.

891
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,320
- It's because he lost it. - I didn't lose it.

892
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,590
It's when the boyfriend lost the couple shirt?

893
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,290
- Gosh. - That's a good metaphor.

894
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,800
It's obvious with Jong Kook and Ha Ra.

895
00:32:37,805 --> 00:32:40,630
They look like professional game players.

896
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,160
They got together to play games.

897
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,400
They run a business.

898
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,870
- Ha Ra has calmed down a lot. - Really?

899
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,510
- She isn't like before. - Of course not.

900
00:32:48,515 --> 00:32:50,670
This is your first mission with Chance Card on the line.

901
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,940
Let's start Talent Competition.

902
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,380
(Talent Competition)

903
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,250
Talent Competition?

904
00:32:56,785 --> 00:32:59,550
Among six skills that female players feel most confident about,

905
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:02,550
we'll select three and hold competitions.

906
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,720
The couple with the most stickers wins.

907
00:33:04,765 --> 00:33:07,860
If the skill is what you submitted, you win one R Sticker.

908
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,660
If it's a skill submitted by someone else, you win two stickers.

909
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,230
(You win two R Stickers.)

910
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,860
Okay, it must be someone else's talent.

911
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,600
You'll play three rounds. The team with the most stickers...

912
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,510
gets a chance to switch partners and find out the number you want.

913
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:22,680
We'll win.

914
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:23,940
The team that comes in last...

915
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,910
will reveal the number that you have.

916
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:28,340
My goodness.

917
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,680
(The team that comes in last must reveal their numbers.)

918
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,620
This is difficult.

919
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:34,280
- We have to show our numbers? - How?

920
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:35,950
Can it be just one of us?

921
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,450
(Can only one of us show the number?)

922
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,120
- Both of you must show it. - Is that so?

923
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:42,320
(Let's not do this already.)

924
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,560
- Don't do this. - I won't.

925
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,330
- We haven't started yet. - Gosh.

926
00:33:45,605 --> 00:33:47,030
- Shall we select one? - Yes.

927
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,300
Select one.

928
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,460
(Which category is it?)

929
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
"Long jump".

930
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,500
(The first talent competition is long jump.)

931
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,910
- Are you good at long jumps? - It's for Ha Ra.

932
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:56,040
- Oh, no. - See?

933
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,140
- How about you? - Pardon?

934
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,840
- Are you good at it? - I am.

935
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,870
Is this your talent?

936
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,380
- Yes, it is. - Really?

937
00:34:02,585 --> 00:34:06,520
(She's talented in long jumps.)

938
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,320
- This is ours. - Da Hee says she's good...

939
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,860
- at everything including singing. - Look at her long legs.

940
00:34:12,095 --> 00:34:13,720
- I'm good. - Her legs are long.

941
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,130
That's right. She likes to jump.

942
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:22,270
Everyone, Da Hee will start first.

943
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:24,930
Have you done it professionally?

944
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,730
We do one-foot jump often...

945
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,840
- as children. - How old were you?

946
00:34:28,915 --> 00:34:30,670
- I was in kindergarten or so. - Kindergarten?

947
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,340
- Yes. - We're in trouble.

948
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,510
- Kindergarten? - She'll be good.

949
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,380
She'll jump far because her legs are long.

950
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,110
- Please start. - Shall I start now?

951
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,180
- Yes. - Yes.

952
00:34:39,655 --> 00:34:41,480
- Don't step on the line. - I won't.

953
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,820
- I can't do this well. - Good luck.

954
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:46,660
(She gets nervous.)

955
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:48,930
It won't be easy with those shoes.

956
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:52,460
Calm down, and relax.

957
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,600
(Will she show off her talent with her long legs?)

958
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,670
That's good.

959
00:34:59,715 --> 00:35:00,840
(Landing)

960
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:08,380
- She jumped really far. - Mark right here.

961
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,320
- It's not enough space. - There's her footprint.

962
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,150
No way. How did she jump that far?

963
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:21,320
I jumped to here.

964
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,400
- I got it. - It's right here.

965
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:25,390
- It's 43. - It's 2m 43cm.

966
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,930
Who can beat that?

967
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:28,930
Even men can't jump that far.

968
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,760
All right, Da Hee.

969
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,770
- Are you satisfied? - Yes.

970
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:34,270
(She can't believe it either.)

971
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,700
- Who wants to go next? - In A will go.

972
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,170
- Come on, In A. - Okay.

973
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,080
Give me your bag.

974
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:42,440
Let's go.

975
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,650
- Haha. - 2, 3, 4.

976
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,520
- In A, In A, in artist, baby - In A, In A, in artist, baby

977
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:53,720
(With a chant, they show their teamwork.)

978
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,630
She's good at this.

979
00:35:55,965 --> 00:35:57,790
- In A does it well. - She does.

980
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:00,030
- Yes. - Start farther back.

981
00:36:00,105 --> 00:36:01,830
(Where are they going?)

982
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,960
Okay, that's good.

983
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,870
- How far are you going? - How far are you going?

984
00:36:05,345 --> 00:36:08,140
I tried that far before, but you get tired on the way.

985
00:36:08,715 --> 00:36:09,840
Let's go, In A.

986
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:12,810
If In A jumps farther,

987
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,340
she wins two stickers. Da Hee, on the other hand...

988
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,380
You can do it, In A.

989
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:18,580
This is Da Hee's talent, so she gets another turn.

990
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,620
- You can do it. - I can do it.

991
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:22,250
Let's go.

992
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,390
(In A gives a try.)

993
00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,150
(Will In A break the record?)

994
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,630
(Will In A, full of confidence, be able to break the record?)

995
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:37,330
- It's right here. - No, no.

996
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,470
- This is the spot. - All right.

997
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,570
- There's a mark here. - Hold on.

998
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,130
- Where is it? - Here it is. This is it.

999
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,770
- This is the footprint. This is it. - My gosh.

1000
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,050
- It's 2m 44cm. - It's 45.

1001
00:36:51,725 --> 00:36:52,880
- It's 44. - Okay.

1002
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,410
- In A! - Yes!

1003
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:55,620
1, 2, 3, 4.

1004
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,520
(In A, In A)

1005
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,320
(In A, artist, baby)

1006
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:00,790
Great.

1007
00:37:00,935 --> 00:37:02,320
This is great. You were so cool.

1008
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,230
(Her eyes are fuming.)

1009
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,160
Look at Da Hee's face. She looks so intense again.

1010
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:09,660
(Oh, no. I got caught.)

1011
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,930
This means that...

1012
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,770
(Haha and In A are in 1st place.)

1013
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,270
Ha Ra is going to go for it now.

1014
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:16,640
She starred on "Idol Star Athletics Championships".

1015
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,710
(The time has come.)

1016
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:25,080
(Ha Ra holds the reputation for the best runner.)

1017
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,550
(Ha Ra, the athlete, has returned.)

1018
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,560
- Your pants are wide. Are you okay? - Will you be all right?

1019
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:33,790
I was wondering that too.

1020
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:35,060
- I should pull it up. - Pull it all the way up.

1021
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,090
If you jump with wide pants, it will make a flapping sound.

1022
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,430
The pants are highly resistant.

1023
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:42,940
- I don't know what will happen. - Good luck, Ha Ra.

1024
00:37:42,945 --> 00:37:44,260
That's true.

1025
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,740
- She starred on the sports show. - It's been a while.

1026
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,540
Don't be nervous.

1027
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:52,710
(The third challenger, Ha Ra goes for it.)

1028
00:37:54,015 --> 00:38:00,020
(Will she be able to defend her honor of the best athlete?)

1029
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:06,560
(What? What just happened?)

1030
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:12,730
- Come on. - Hey.

1031
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:14,800
That's all right.

1032
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:16,700
- Let's try it one more time. - No, no, no.

1033
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,070
- Do it one more time. - Wait, no, no.

1034
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,970
- Let me try one more time. - Come on, let her try it again.

1035
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,500
- Give her a chance. - Wait, please.

1036
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,200
- She should get a second chance. - I couldn't see. I couldn't.

1037
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,270
I couldn't see where it was.

1038
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,940
- Her nose is getting longer. - Where is it? Is this the line?

1039
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,010
- Ha Ra. - Yes?

1040
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,180
- You stepped here. - No, no.

1041
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:32,810
- Do you think you can do it? - Jae Seok.

1042
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,480
- Tighten your shoelaces. - Can you do it one more time?

1043
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,650
- My pants are wide. - Can you do it one more time?

1044
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,720
(She makes a point with her pants.)

1045
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,220
- Okay. This is your last chance. - Can you do it?

1046
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:41,320
Ha Ra, stick your pants in your socks.

1047
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,390
Ha Ra, are your toes okay?

1048
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:48,630
Ha Ra.

1049
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,360
Her pants became an old lady's pants.

1050
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,470
That's great.

1051
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,940
Ha Ra hasn't changed a bit.

1052
00:38:52,945 --> 00:38:55,470
Ha Ra hasn't changed at all. I thought she changed.

1053
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:56,600
She's doing her best.

1054
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,510
- She's determined now. - All right. And...

1055
00:38:58,515 --> 00:39:00,770
Don't let it burden you. It's all right.

1056
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,080
Start.

1057
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,880
- I see greed in her face. - She moved too far back.

1058
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,080
Slowly. It's all right.

1059
00:39:08,325 --> 00:39:09,520
Hey, what is this?

1060
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:14,020
Hey, hold on.

1061
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:15,330
She jumped a long distance.

1062
00:39:15,635 --> 00:39:17,660
(No way. That's incredible!)

1063
00:39:18,735 --> 00:39:19,870
Hey, hold on.

1064
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,190
(He's shocked.)

1065
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,960
- It's right there. - No, this is the spot.

1066
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,230
(Could she have possibly...)

1067
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,130
You did so well, but you jumped way behind the starting line.

1068
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,070
(What a bummer.)

1069
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,980
(She did jump far behind the line like Jong Kook said.)

1070
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,450
Where did I jump?

1071
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,250
- You jumped from here. - Where?

1072
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:46,560
- Then can you add the distance? - She was scared.

1073
00:39:46,565 --> 00:39:48,560
This isn't a place for you to play tricks.

1074
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
- No way. - My gosh.

1075
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,290
That was so close, Ha Ra.

1076
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:54,360
(Thanks to Ha Ra, In A and Haha are still in 1st place.)

1077
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,830
- Who's next? - Mina will go.

1078
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,100
- Mina! - All right!

1079
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,370
(Mina is up next.)

1080
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,470
And...

1081
00:39:59,645 --> 00:40:01,300
- Get ready. - Excuse me.

1082
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:03,710
Da Hee, why are you looking like that?

1083
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,340
- I can't watch? - I felt something creepy.

1084
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:11,310
(Her eyes are brimming with intensity.)

1085
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:15,290
(Da Hee, the scary-eyed woman, is watching.)

1086
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,320
We're going to give it a go.

1087
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,160
Where is she?

1088
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:22,890
Where is she?

1089
00:40:23,065 --> 00:40:24,930
(Peekaboo)

1090
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:27,030
Here she comes. She's going now.

1091
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:29,430
(She's doing a run-up in order to accelerate her speed.)

1092
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:30,900
Mina, run! Mina.

1093
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,500
- That's great! - Mina, keep running!

1094
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:37,970
(Screaming)

1095
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:40,840
She jumped far behind the line too.

1096
00:40:42,055 --> 00:40:44,010
It's 2m 16cm.

1097
00:40:44,055 --> 00:40:45,520
That was close.

1098
00:40:45,595 --> 00:40:48,260
Next up is Ji Hyo!

1099
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:50,520
I think Ji Hyo can do this well.

1100
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,020
- Excuse me. - Yes?

1101
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,020
Ha Ra keeps complaining that her pants were too long.

1102
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,390
She's complaining.

1103
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:56,760
Stop it.

1104
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,560
- That's enough. - She's disappointed. That's all.

1105
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
- Don't wear wide pants to shoots. - She's disappointed.

1106
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,830
- Don't wear such pants for shows. - It's just a shame.

1107
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,900
- She was too far behind. - I should change my pants.

1108
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
When she did her jump, did you know that...

1109
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,440
she made the flapping sound of a robe?

1110
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:09,810
- Like a pigeon flapping. - That's right.

1111
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:13,410
I saw several pigeons emerging from her pants.

1112
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,710
- I saw pigeons emerging. - People wear them for kendo.

1113
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,080
Da Hee, listen to the conversation.

1114
00:41:18,955 --> 00:41:20,480
(Focused)

1115
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,120
Da Hee, listen to the conversation.

1116
00:41:23,425 --> 00:41:24,920
She keeps looking at the mat.

1117
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,250
It's not going according to her plan today.

1118
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,160
(Da Hee is completely focused on the match.)

1119
00:41:28,835 --> 00:41:31,930
- They must not cross the line. - It's not going as she planned.

1120
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,060
When I heard this, I was so shocked.

1121
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,230
- I got the chills. - What is it?

1122
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,360
She was an athlete for long jumping.

1123
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,540
- At that time... - When?

1124
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:40,870
- I doubt it. Her limbs are short. - And then what?

1125
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,270
- Don't let that bother you. - Hey!

1126
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,840
- What? - Don't let him get to you.

1127
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:45,510
(He manages to provoke her.)

1128
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,270
Ji Hyo will try now.

1129
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,010
- Bring it back - Bring it back

1130
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:52,550
- Why are you singing it? - The title resembles her nickname.

1131
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,050
- I see. - Bring it back

1132
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,380
You're forcing the pun.

1133
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:56,820
They're making all sorts of puns.

1134
00:41:57,565 --> 00:42:01,250
(She displays the look of a real athlete.)

1135
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,360
Get ready. Start!

1136
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:05,560
There you go, Ji Hyo.

1137
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,800
She will turn 40 soon.

1138
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:09,830
She will turn 40 soon.

1139
00:42:14,475 --> 00:42:18,740
(Oh, my goodness)

1140
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,380
(This is unbelievable.)

1141
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:22,850
This is the spot.

1142
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:25,150
(Please)

1143
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,350
- 36. - Gosh.

1144
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,150
(Ji Hyo is placed 3rd.)

1145
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,220
- Currently, In A is... - Yes?

1146
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:34,490
- leading by 1cm. - I see.

1147
00:42:34,535 --> 00:42:36,230
Da Hee will go last now.

1148
00:42:36,535 --> 00:42:38,860
- It's her last chance. - The last chance.

1149
00:42:39,075 --> 00:42:41,660
- Long jumping was her talent. - You can do it, Da Hee.

1150
00:42:41,745 --> 00:42:43,460
Start.

1151
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,630
(Will Da Hee, the talent owner, be able to reclaim 1st place?)

1152
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,900
Please step on the line. Step on the line.

1153
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,210
(Will Da Hee, the talent owner, be able to reclaim 1st place?)

1154
00:42:53,015 --> 00:42:54,340
(Please)

1155
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:57,850
Great!

1156
00:42:59,555 --> 00:43:03,720
(She makes a powerful jump.)

1157
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,320
(It utterly shocks everyone.)

1158
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:09,120
- 8... 85? - My gosh.

1159
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:15,470
(What's the result of her jump that shocked everyone?)

1160
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:18,230
- 8... 85? It's 85! - My gosh.

1161
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,700
(Impressed)

1162
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:25,870
(Da Hee sets a new record of 2m 85m.)

1163
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:28,380
This concludes that the first round...

1164
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,880
- goes to Da Hee and Se Chan. - Awesome!

1165
00:43:30,885 --> 00:43:32,450
You were amazing, Da Hee.

1166
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,750
- She's amazing. - She's incredible.

1167
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,520
In A, you did well. You were so cool.

1168
00:43:35,695 --> 00:43:37,090
Let's put it here.

1169
00:43:37,095 --> 00:43:39,250
(Thanks to Da Hee's victory,)

1170
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,560
(Se Chan and Da Hee acquire 1 sticker.)

1171
00:43:42,565 --> 00:43:45,690
Let me choose the next round.

1172
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,660
- Let me pick. - Please.

1173
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,870
- "Nostalgic Dance". Whose is it? - Nostalgic Dance.

1174
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,470
(Nostalgic Dance)

1175
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:53,540
Nostalgic Dance.

1176
00:43:53,645 --> 00:43:55,370
That's So Min's.

1177
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,640
(It's So Min's talent.)

1178
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,340
- That's right. - Nostalgic Dance.

1179
00:43:58,355 --> 00:44:02,750
(Her best talent is doing the nostalgic dances.)

1180
00:44:02,825 --> 00:44:04,280
Actually, So Min...

1181
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,250
once trained to become an idol singer.

1182
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,020
- No, that's not true. - So...

1183
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:09,420
- Faceless Singer. - Right.

1184
00:44:09,465 --> 00:44:11,060
- Voiceless Singer. - Singer...

1185
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,320
- No, it's Faceless Singer. - Why?

1186
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,750
How could a singer be voiceless?

1187
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,420
- It's because she can't sing. - I'm a bad singer.

1188
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,620
- Hence, the name. - It's Faceless Singer.

1189
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,970
- I can't sing. - All right.

1190
00:44:18,975 --> 00:44:21,690
- So Min should start us off. - That's right.

1191
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,900
- Right. - So Min, it's your time.

1192
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,070
- Let's move back. - Break a leg.

1193
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:25,310
Here's the music.

1194
00:44:25,315 --> 00:44:26,770
I wish it's a song I know.

1195
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:27,900
Break a leg, So Min.

1196
00:44:28,075 --> 00:44:29,470
- This... - Go for it.

1197
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,410
I don't know the dance to this song. How could I know this?

1198
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:36,950
("Good Time" by Cleo)

1199
00:44:37,625 --> 00:44:39,180
- I can't dance to this. - Do sexy and cute moves.

1200
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,580
- It's So Min's time. - You're the best!

1201
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:44,950
(She changes all of a sudden.)

1202
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:49,530
(She does the key dance moves for the song.)

1203
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:53,200
(This 33-year-old woman looks adorable and sexy.)

1204
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:55,160
You're doing great!

1205
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:57,600
(She's summoning Cleo. People of 1999, reply to this.)

1206
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,670
You're great.

1207
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,330
Let's change. Let's change the song.

1208
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,430
(Her unfulfilled dream of an idol singer...)

1209
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,300
- This move was so long time ago. - She's actually good.

1210
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,670
- I haven't seen that dance in ages. - Exactly.

1211
00:45:05,585 --> 00:45:07,270
- She did it. - That was great.

1212
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,840
- Great. - She's good at it.

1213
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,010
So Min, you're excellent.

1214
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,980
(The second song is...)

1215
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,050
("Twist King" by Turbo from 1996.)

1216
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,020
Look at her. That was sudden.

1217
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,520
(She dances as soon as the song is played.)

1218
00:45:19,635 --> 00:45:22,190
My goodness. She knows the dance.

1219
00:45:22,205 --> 00:45:24,100
- She knows it. That's correct. - Is that it?

1220
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:25,900
- She's doing it right. - So Min.

1221
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,300
She's incredible indeed.

1222
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,170
So Min is good at dancing.

1223
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:32,130
I can't believe she actually knows it.

1224
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,670
(She twists her feet zealously.)

1225
00:45:38,145 --> 00:45:39,340
(I'm the master of nostalgic dance!)

1226
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,750
That's good. That's enough.

1227
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,810
That's it. Let's stop here.

1228
00:45:42,955 --> 00:45:44,010
Well done.

1229
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,850
- So Min, you did a great job. - That was excellent.

1230
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,580
- You did it. - You were amazing!

1231
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,120
- She's good. - Everyone.

1232
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,390
So Min did such a great job with it.

1233
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:54,350
- She was incredible. - She did well as expected.

1234
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:56,560
She did make the dance look like it's from the old days.

1235
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,190
Can they just go for it if they feel confident?

1236
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,700
- Sorry? - Can they just go for it?

1237
00:45:59,735 --> 00:46:02,360
If you're confident, anyone can go for it.

1238
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,060
- Oh, really? - Let's continue.

1239
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,930
Please. I hope it's a song I know.

1240
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,430
(What's the first song for Nostalgic Dance?)

1241
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:08,600
("Why Do You" by Chul Yi and Mi Ae)

1242
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,940
Mina went for it. That's it!

1243
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:12,470
(As soon as the song is played,)

1244
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,540
(Mina and In A go for it.)

1245
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,440
- Mina knows the dance! - In A, move forward.

1246
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,180
- Great. - There you go. Move forward.

1247
00:46:18,495 --> 00:46:21,480
(It's a cutthroat battle to take the center spot.)

1248
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:23,290
You're doing great.

1249
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:25,250
That was awesome, In A.

1250
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:27,260
- That was nice. - That was awesome, Mina!

1251
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,160
- Way to go, In A! - You're doing great, In A!

1252
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,260
Mina!

1253
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:39,170
(In A pulls out a hidden card.)

1254
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:41,430
Mina, please go back.

1255
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,440
Mina, wait.

1256
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,570
Wait.

1257
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:44,900
- Wait. - You were amazing.

1258
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,270
- In A. - Mina, please wait.

1259
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,880
- In A has so much energy. - In A wins.

1260
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,550
Both were great though.

1261
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:50,880
Next song.

1262
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,910
(The next song is...)

1263
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,680
All the songs are very old.

1264
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,450
- Come in. - This is me.

1265
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,420
("Mister" by Kara)

1266
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:01,060
(The original singer joins.)

1267
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:02,760
(Let me try too.)

1268
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,060
Kara!

1269
00:47:04,135 --> 00:47:06,760
(Ha Ra versus In A versus Mina)

1270
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:11,030
(The "Mister" dance is perfectly reproduced.)

1271
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:18,110
(Ha Ra is owning the stage.)

1272
00:47:19,285 --> 00:47:21,140
This is me.

1273
00:47:21,615 --> 00:47:22,810
Nice.

1274
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,540
Let Ha Ra win.

1275
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,410
- This is me. - We have no choice.

1276
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,350
- She has to win. - "This is me."

1277
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,350
- "This is me." - "I'm Koo Ha Ra."

1278
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,650
"This is me."

1279
00:47:30,895 --> 00:47:32,150
We have no choice.

1280
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,060
- I'm surprised by Mina. - Right.

1281
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:37,060
Her moves are so...

1282
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:40,260
- So energetic. - What did you do?

1283
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:43,400
That's not how you do it.

1284
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:46,030
(Determined)

1285
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,840
(The original singer gives strict instructions.)

1286
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,970
Nice.

1287
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,610
Let's start the game now.

1288
00:47:53,615 --> 00:47:55,880
Like I said, the champion...

1289
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,380
- The champion has an advantage? - has an advantage.

1290
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,310
They can join last.

1291
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,110
- Join when you want. - Join at the last minute.

1292
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:02,820
The music will keep playing.

1293
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,080
Reflecting everyone's opinions...

1294
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,220
- We'll... - Let's eliminate them one by one.

1295
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,790
We'll eliminate them one by one.

1296
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,590
If it's getting too fierce?

1297
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:11,860
Play the music.

1298
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,490
(Music starts.)

1299
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,800
Do you know this one? It's Lee Jung Hyun.

1300
00:48:15,945 --> 00:48:18,470
- This is mine. - Too bad for Mina.

1301
00:48:19,215 --> 00:48:24,110
("Wa" by Lee Jung Hyun)

1302
00:48:24,245 --> 00:48:26,510
- Just dance as you want. - Here we go.

1303
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:28,880
She's so good.

1304
00:48:29,355 --> 00:48:31,410
Let's go, Mina!

1305
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,950
(The 1999-born reinterprets "Wa".)

1306
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,810
- You don't know the dance? - It suits the song.

1307
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,720
- She doesn't know the song? - Let's go, Mina!

1308
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:38,050
Let's do this!

1309
00:48:38,095 --> 00:48:40,220
In A comes onto the stage.

1310
00:48:40,465 --> 00:48:41,790
In A.

1311
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,890
(Pushing)

1312
00:48:43,735 --> 00:48:46,030
Let's go.

1313
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,030
(After pushing Mina away, In A starts to techno dance.)

1314
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,830
Mina is eliminated.

1315
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:51,660
(She's getting into the zone.)

1316
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,530
- That's what we're talking about. - She's so good.

1317
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,670
She's so passionate.

1318
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,310
- Way to go! - She's so enthusiastic.

1319
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:58,500
Nice.

1320
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,810
That's Lee Jung Hyun.

1321
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,510
Go, Da Hee! Nice!

1322
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:04,680
- Great! - That's Lee Jung Hyun.

1323
00:49:05,455 --> 00:49:07,810
- That's Lee Jung Hyun. - Amazing.

1324
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,450
Way to go!

1325
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,620
(Powerful)

1326
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,920
(She owns the stage with her appearance and dance.)

1327
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,390
That's exactly like Lee Jung Hyun!

1328
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:15,420
We can't beat that!

1329
00:49:15,665 --> 00:49:18,190
We can't do this.

1330
00:49:19,205 --> 00:49:22,900
(She's having her moment.)

1331
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:25,870
- Gosh. - Da Hee did it!

1332
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,610
- Da Hee! - It's over.

1333
00:49:29,915 --> 00:49:31,500
- Da Hee wins. - No one can beat that.

1334
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,810
Da Hee wins.

1335
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,270
- No one can beat that. - Da Hee wins.

1336
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,840
- Da Hee wins. - No one can beat that.

1337
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,710
Let her win.

1338
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,550
- You win. - You win.

1339
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:41,580
I thought Lee Jung Hyun really came.

1340
00:49:42,365 --> 00:49:43,690
Look at this.

1341
00:49:43,895 --> 00:49:46,920
She couldn't even try after preparing this.

1342
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:49,520
Because of Da Hee, she couldn't even try.

1343
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,620
Too bad. She should have tried.

1344
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,630
It's unbelievable.

1345
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,360
Da Hee is...

1346
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,200
- threatening the others. - She is.

1347
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:59,200
Da Hee, how did you wait until today?

1348
00:49:59,545 --> 00:50:02,000
- Da Hee and Ha Ra... - She's unrivaled.

1349
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:03,310
Next song.

1350
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,810
(The next song is...)

1351
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,780
It's "Coming-of-Age Ceremony".

1352
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:14,020
(Da Hee and Ha Ra are getting ready.)

1353
00:50:14,525 --> 00:50:15,890
This is...

1354
00:50:16,595 --> 00:50:18,820
(Crowded)

1355
00:50:19,295 --> 00:50:20,720
Something is weird.

1356
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:22,420
(So Min's moves are accurate.)

1357
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,630
Look at So Min.

1358
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:27,990
(Stiff)

1359
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,460
Something is weird.

1360
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,500
- Something is weird. - Da Hee, you're eliminated.

1361
00:50:33,815 --> 00:50:36,970
(Someone weirder lies down.)

1362
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:39,440
(I feel tired today.)

1363
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,910
What is she doing?

1364
00:50:42,225 --> 00:50:43,850
Look at So Min.

1365
00:50:43,955 --> 00:50:46,280
- Way to go! - It's a mess.

1366
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,750
- What is this? - What is she doing?

1367
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,020
That's hilarious.

1368
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:53,360
- Da Hee. - Nice!

1369
00:50:54,195 --> 00:50:56,320
- Da Hee. - That's amazing.

1370
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,560
You're good.

1371
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,100
(Climax)

1372
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:01,990
(I'm...)

1373
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,200
(the dancing queen...)

1374
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,300
(here.)

1375
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,540
Okay. It's over.

1376
00:51:07,545 --> 00:51:10,400
- Good job, Ha Ra. - You did great.

1377
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,610
Good job, So Min.

1378
00:51:12,685 --> 00:51:14,570
- Is it okay to roll on the floor? - That was hilarious.

1379
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:16,410
- These three are not okay. - Good job.

1380
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:19,550
Is it okay to roll on the floor?

1381
00:51:19,555 --> 00:51:21,450
I thought Ha Ra collapsed.

1382
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:24,220
I thought it was the red carpet.

1383
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:25,750
I thought...

1384
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,790
it was the red carpet. I was so surprised.

1385
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,220
Da Hee, you're doing great,

1386
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,330
but I don't want to see that facial expression.

1387
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:34,060
"It's my turn."

1388
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:37,000
(Music is the only drug allowed by the law.)

1389
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,100
- It was so annoying. - She can't hide it.

1390
00:51:39,475 --> 00:51:41,030
Her emotions show on her face.

1391
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,670
She can't hide anything.

1392
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,210
This is the final round.

1393
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:47,480
Let's see who wins.

1394
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:49,340
In A is so cool.

1395
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,610
In A picked a song herself.

1396
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,050
She learned how to dance.

1397
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,610
- In A is... - She's so good.

1398
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,050
She's like a clubber.

1399
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,390
- Play the music. - Go, In A!

1400
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:01,990
("Bang Bang Bang" by BIGBANG)

1401
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:06,030
(From head to toe,)

1402
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:08,430
(she's so cool.)

1403
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:14,440
This is amazing.

1404
00:52:15,015 --> 00:52:16,440
Let's go!

1405
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:21,610

- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

1407
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,350
(She's full of hiphop spirit.)

1408
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:27,910
(She looks professional.)

1409
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,980
My face is so red.

00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,020
She's doing something.

1412
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,360
- She's doing something. - She's doing something.

1413
00:52:36,965 --> 00:52:38,330
What was that?

1414
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,660
(Freeze)

1415
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,070
- Amazing. - What was that?

1416
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:45,270
Oh, my.

1417
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:47,030
What was that?

1418
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,540
Was that really necessary?

1419
00:52:49,515 --> 00:52:53,010
Was that necessary?

1420
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:56,910
(Respect)

1421
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,950
Nothing can beat a freeze.

1422
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,750
Can you show us one more time?

1423
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,680
I can't believe it.

1424
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,120
- She's so strong. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1425
00:53:10,905 --> 00:53:12,560
(Impressed)

1426
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,860
I'm tired.

1427
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,160
Can you do it?

1428
00:53:16,205 --> 00:53:17,970
- Ha Ra. - She wants to try.

1429
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:20,130
How do you do it?

1430
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:23,540
You don't know? Do you want to learn it now?

1431
00:53:24,015 --> 00:53:28,980
- 1, 2, 3... - 1, 2, 3...

1432
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,680
- Put your arms down. - Okay.

1433
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,850
Go down and put your forehead on the floor.

1434
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,280
Get your feet off the floor.

1435
00:53:34,355 --> 00:53:35,820
(Ha Ra falls.)

1436
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:39,890
(Falling)

1437
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:42,430
Ha Ra, go back.

1438
00:53:43,105 --> 00:53:45,360
Hold on. Da Hee came to me...

1439
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,590
and asked...

1440
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,370
if "1, 2, 3" was really necessary.

1441
00:53:49,375 --> 00:53:51,030
- Is "1, 2, 3" necessary? - Da Hee, come here.

1442
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,300
She was wondering.

1443
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,630
- Da Hee, try. - No.

1444
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,040
- She doesn't think it's necessary. - No.

1445
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,440
- She thinks she can do it. - Try it.

1446
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,270
- Try. - How are you going to do it?

1447
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,940
You don't need the first part.

1448
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,780
You just have to support yourself with your arms.

1449
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,940
- Right? - Yes.

1450
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,250
- She might be able to do it. - Like this...

1451
00:54:06,495 --> 00:54:11,120
Will it really be okay if this airs?

1452
00:54:12,895 --> 00:54:14,490
Like this...

1453
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:17,890
(She rolls on the floor.)

1454
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,190
- Da Hee. - What's with you?

1455
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,530
What did she do?

1456
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,470
- Mina, can you do it? - Try it.

1457
00:54:23,475 --> 00:54:25,000
You can do it.

1458
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:26,900
Put your elbow here.

1459
00:54:27,215 --> 00:54:28,970
- Why are they learning it? - Here.

1460
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,470
- In A prepared so much. - Let's go.

1461
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:33,010
- Put your forehead on the floor. - It must be hard.

1462
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,380
- Let's do this. - You need strength.

1463
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:36,080
(Screaming)

1464
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,350
What was that sound?

1465
00:54:37,825 --> 00:54:40,650
(She sounds like a pterosaur.)

1466
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:43,280
- What was that sound? - It must be hard.

1467
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,980
- What was that? - What did you do?

1468
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,660
This is Jurassic Park.

1469
00:54:46,795 --> 00:54:48,290
It was a pterosaur.

1470
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,020
- Did you make that sound? - Did you?

1471
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,560
What was that scream?

1472
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,190
Who made that sound?

1473
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:54,630
Mina, what was it?

1474
00:54:54,935 --> 00:54:57,260
It's such a mess.

1475
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,530
Put your hands down.

1476
00:54:59,615 --> 00:55:01,270
- And your leg. - Okay.

1477
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,740
Put your forehead down.

1478
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:04,240
Lift your legs.

1479
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,810
- Lift your legs. - Lift your legs.

1480
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,080
(Thump)

1481
00:55:09,025 --> 00:55:12,110
What was that? Did someone fart?

1482
00:55:13,295 --> 00:55:14,580
What was that sound?

1483
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,750
(She can't control her body.)

1484
00:55:17,095 --> 00:55:19,260
- She's annoyed. - She'll be 40 soon.

1485
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:22,220
She'll be 40 soon.

1486
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:23,590
- How do you do it? - In A is amazing.

1487
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,120
Did In A win?

1488
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,260
- She wins, right? - She's amazing.

1489
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,390
This is the final round.

1490
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:30,000
- So Min has... - Right.

1491
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,960
- Please play an old song. - another chance.

1492
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,500
- This is the last song. - Go.

1493
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,970
(The last song is "I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S.)

1494
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,800
- So Min. - S.E.S.

1495
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,440
- I like S.E.S. - Let's go!

1496
00:55:40,915 --> 00:55:46,450
("I'm Your Girl" by S.E.S)

1497
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:50,850
(As soon as the song starts,)

1498
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,820
(So Min becomes immersed.)

1499
00:55:55,595 --> 00:55:57,290
(Mina joins.)

1500
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,860
Mina even knows this dance.

1501
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:01,260
Mina.

1502
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:04,660
She knows every dance.

1503
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,400
(The song was released 2 years before she was born.)

1504
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,770
S.E.S!

1505
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:12,200
Here comes Da Hee!

1506
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,310
(The real one is here.)

1507
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:19,580
(Da Hee looks exactly like Bada.)

1508
00:56:20,395 --> 00:56:21,580
Ji Hyo.

1509
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,550
(The 2018 version of S.E.S)

1510
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,590
- No one can stop Da Hee. - No.

1511
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:27,720
Seriously.

1512
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,320
(She's the best entertainer today.)

1513
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,260
She is amazing.

1514
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,300
They're S.E.S.

1515
00:56:33,835 --> 00:56:35,360
That's good enough.

1516
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,430
(The fierce dance battle ends.)

1517
00:56:37,205 --> 00:56:39,340
Where did she get the hair tie?

1518
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:40,630
Is she some crook?

1519
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,910
- Take away her hair tie. - She's a crook.

1520
00:56:42,915 --> 00:56:45,040
Did she invite a makeup team?

1521
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,240
- Let me say something. - Wait.

1522
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,580
Why did this team get a private dressing room?

1523
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,380
- That's not it. - Everyone else stays here,

1524
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:53,850
but you enter from back there.

1525
00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:57,950
(She's prepared to act like Lee Jung Hyun.)

1526
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,790
(She even looks like Ba Da.)

1527
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,560
(Where does she get changed?)

1528
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,560
- She needs time to do makeup. - What?

1529
00:57:04,905 --> 00:57:07,430
- She needs to change. - My goodness.

1530
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:08,760
- Everyone. - She's like a crook.

1531
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,900
We have a winner.

1532
00:57:09,905 --> 00:57:11,060
They're Da Hee and Se Chan.

1533
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,500
(Based on the votes, Se Chan and Da Hee win.)

1534
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,070
(They win twice consecutively.)

1535
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:16,170
This is her day.

1536
00:57:16,545 --> 00:57:17,870
I'm jealous.

1537
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,280
She's like a crook.

1538
00:57:19,285 --> 00:57:22,640
Everyone, it's the first time since the segment started.

1539
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,010
It's over since we have a winner.

1540
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,010
Okay.

1541
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,750
(They win with 3 R Stickers.)

1542
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:29,420
(Se Chan and Da Hee win a Chance Card.)

1543
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:35,420
As a result, Seok Jin and So Min come in last.

1544
00:57:35,435 --> 00:57:38,120
Please reveal your numbers.

1545
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,390
- Do we both reveal it? - Yes, both of you.

1546
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,230
(Both must show their numbers.)

1547
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,900
People will want my number once they find out.

1548
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,430
What is Seok Jin's number?

1549
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,770
(Seok Jin's number is 3.)

1550
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,170
- Three. - That's tricky.

1551
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,900
- It's a tricky number. - Three.

1552
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,770
(3 is a tricky number.)

1553
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:53,770
It's a tricky number.

1554
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:54,840
So Min?

1555
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:56,250
- It's 2. - 2.

1556
00:57:56,655 --> 00:57:58,010
That's a good number.

1557
00:57:58,955 --> 00:58:01,050
- Yes, it is. - Okay.

1558
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,790
The highest total as of now is...

1559
00:58:04,165 --> 00:58:05,220
12.

1560
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:08,820
(The highest total is 12.)

1561
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:12,630
Does that mean a couple has 6 and 6?

1562
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:15,430
The lowest total is...

1563
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:19,870
The highest total as of now is...

1564
00:58:20,237 --> 00:58:21,305
12.

1565
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:24,908
(The highest total is 12.)

1566
00:58:25,442 --> 00:58:28,712
Does that mean a couple has 6 and 6?

1567
00:58:28,712 --> 00:58:31,515
The lowest total is...

1568
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,985
- 5. - That was us.

1569
00:58:34,985 --> 00:58:37,288
(Seok Jin and So Min's total is 5.)

1570
00:58:37,288 --> 00:58:39,023
- It was us. - Why did you whistle?

1571
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:40,391
We should break that couple.

1572
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,092
The winning couple must break them.

1573
00:58:42,092 --> 00:58:45,429
For Se Chan and Da Hee who won,

1574
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:48,866
only one of you gets a Chance Card. Play rock-paper-scissors.

1575
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,334
I will win.

1576
00:58:50,768 --> 00:58:53,003
Rock-paper-scissors.

1577
00:58:53,203 --> 00:58:54,872
- Okay. - Se Chan.

1578
00:58:54,872 --> 00:58:56,473
- Step to the front. - Okay.

1579
00:58:56,473 --> 00:58:58,976
(He gets a chance to switch partners.)

1580
00:58:58,976 --> 00:59:01,078
Which number would you like to know?

1581
00:59:01,812 --> 00:59:03,013
Female player who has number one.

1582
00:59:03,514 --> 00:59:05,416
- Female player? - Yes.

1583
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,917
Female player that has number one...

1584
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:08,585
is Mina.

1585
00:59:08,585 --> 00:59:09,720
(It's Mina.)

1586
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,121
(In that case...)

1587
00:59:11,121 --> 00:59:12,256
It's Mina.

1588
00:59:13,924 --> 00:59:15,059
I have no idea.

1589
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:16,126
- Tell us. - No.

1590
00:59:16,694 --> 00:59:19,330
Gosh, it's too general.

1591
00:59:19,396 --> 00:59:22,933
Se Chan, would you like to switch partners?

1592
00:59:22,933 --> 00:59:24,335
(What will Se Chan choose?)

1593
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:25,402
I will be...

1594
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,438
partners with Mina.

1595
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:30,140
(He exchanges with Kwang Soo.)

1596
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:32,276
- I'm sorry. - Who?

1597
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:33,410
It was fun.

1598
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:35,346
- Gosh. - Mina.

1599
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:37,414
- Change partners. - Hello.

1600
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,049
- It's nice to meet you. - Who has 6 and 6?

1601
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:41,151
- She looks happier than before. - We were perfect.

1602
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:42,986
Da Hee looks so happy now.

1603
00:59:42,986 --> 00:59:44,154
They look good together as well.

1604
00:59:44,154 --> 00:59:45,723
They're the perfect height for each other.

1605
00:59:45,723 --> 00:59:47,524
- They look the best together. - Really?

1606
00:59:47,524 --> 00:59:48,792
- I agree. - Yes.

1607
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,161
You two look good as well.

1608
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:53,630
- He looks like her manager. - That's right.

1609
00:59:53,797 --> 00:59:56,033
- He looks like a good deacon. - I'm always ready to go.

1610
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,634
Shall we move on?

1611
00:59:57,634 --> 00:59:59,336
(What will be the result of the switch?)

1612
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,240
Meal Card and Chance Card are on the line for the next mission.

1613
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,475
Even Meal Cards?

1614
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:06,844
It's called Our Lunch Link.

1615
01:00:06,844 --> 01:00:08,612
(Our Lunch Link)

1616
01:00:09,012 --> 01:00:12,383
Partners will be linked by the wrists and search for...

1617
01:00:12,383 --> 01:00:15,252
the members' name stickers that are hidden in the hotel.

1618
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:19,723
Attach the stickers on the Top and Bottom roulettes.

1619
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:21,759
The selected couple from the Top roulette wins Korean beef steak...

1620
01:00:21,759 --> 01:00:24,461
- and a Chance Card. - Korean beef steak?

1621
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:27,164
(Winner from the Top roulette gets Korean beef steak and Chance Card.)

1622
01:00:27,164 --> 01:00:29,900
The rest of the couples will get sandwiches.

1623
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,502
The selected couple from the Bottom roulette...

1624
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,838
gets rice with dried laver and must reveal their numbers.

1625
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:38,542
All couples will start after linking their wrists.

1626
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:39,610
Let's get it. Let's hurry.

1627
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:40,644
- Get it, get it. - Let's go.

1628
01:00:40,644 --> 01:00:41,645
Let's go.

1629
01:00:41,645 --> 01:00:43,547
- This is great. - It's a nice place.

1630
01:00:43,547 --> 01:00:44,681
There's a lot here.

1631
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:46,216
We must win no matter what.

1632
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:48,852
- Jae Seok, we can't separate. - What?

1633
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:52,289
Do you have number six?

1634
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:57,161
(Jae Seok had number 6.)

1635
01:00:57,995 --> 01:00:59,730
(The highest total...)

1636
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:03,167
(is 12. That means...)

1637
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:07,104
(That means Ji Hyo's number is 6 as well.)

1638
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:08,939
- Yes, I have number six. - That's amazing.

1639
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:10,974
How can we both have six?

1640
01:01:10,974 --> 01:01:11,975
(They must keep it a secret.)

1641
01:01:11,975 --> 01:01:13,444
Be quiet so that no one finds out.

1642
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:17,281
How can we search in such a big place?

1643
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:18,749
- Da Hee. - Yes?

1644
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:21,251
Which number does Se Chan have?

1645
01:01:22,186 --> 01:01:23,720
- Se Chan's number? - Yes.

1646
01:01:23,954 --> 01:01:26,123
- Am I allowed to tell you? - Of course.

1647
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,760
You won't be partners with Se Chan again.

1648
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,061
Is your number high or low?

1649
01:01:31,094 --> 01:01:32,229
- Mine? - Yes.

1650
01:01:33,063 --> 01:01:36,300
Shouldn't we know our place since we're a team?

1651
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:39,036
The writer told me that...

1652
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:42,406
- I can believe everyone but you. - What?

1653
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,408
What are you talking about?

1654
01:01:45,843 --> 01:01:47,244
Da Hee, you must tell each other...

1655
01:01:47,244 --> 01:01:49,179
so that we know our place.

1656
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,949
Tell me if your number is high or low.

1657
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:53,450
- It's a high number. - Is it high?

1658
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,352
Yes, what's your number?

1659
01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:57,120
- Mine? - Yes.

1660
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:58,622
My number is six.

1661
01:01:58,856 --> 01:01:59,990
- Is it six? - Yes.

1662
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,458
- Really? - Yes.

1663
01:02:01,992 --> 01:02:03,293
- You have six? - Yes.

1664
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:10,200
(However, they're the couple with 6's.)

1665
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:12,636
(She's a trickster like Kwang Soo.)

1666
01:02:12,636 --> 01:02:13,770
What's your number?

1667
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:16,940
- What is it? - Mine is two.

1668
01:02:17,808 --> 01:02:19,009
Is your number six?

1669
01:02:19,176 --> 01:02:21,178
Yes, what's your number again?

1670
01:02:22,012 --> 01:02:24,815
- To be honest... - Be honest with me.

1671
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:26,850
- You shouldn't lie about it. - Let's show each other.

1672
01:02:27,184 --> 01:02:28,752
(They decide to show the number.)

1673
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:30,153
Show me. One.

1674
01:02:30,153 --> 01:02:31,889
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1675
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:35,092
- You didn't take it out. - Come on.

1676
01:02:35,092 --> 01:02:37,094
- Don't do it. - Is it six?

1677
01:02:37,394 --> 01:02:39,263
Is it six? I'll show you mine.

1678
01:02:39,263 --> 01:02:40,898
- In three. - Put it down here.

1679
01:02:41,098 --> 01:02:43,000
- Put it down. - Is this necessary?

1680
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,935
- Let it go. - Why won't you believe me?

1681
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:46,136
Throw it down.

1682
01:02:46,136 --> 01:02:47,638
- In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1683
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,206
(They hesitate.)

1684
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:50,741
(They're perfect for each other.)

1685
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:53,377
You're a cheater, aren't you?

1686
01:02:53,377 --> 01:02:55,579
- No. In 3, 2, 1. - In 3, 2, 1.

1687
01:02:55,746 --> 01:02:57,648
(It's a big mess.)

1688
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,649
- What? - Okay.

1689
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,517
- I got it. Give me one chance. - You're so...

1690
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:03,253
- You're so terrible. - Okay.

1691
01:03:03,253 --> 01:03:05,522
- You're terrible. - I won't look. I put it down.

1692
01:03:06,023 --> 01:03:07,090
Give it back.

1693
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:09,259
(Was Kwang Soo telling the truth?)

1694
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:12,896
(It's 5.)

1695
01:03:13,931 --> 01:03:16,934
(She's angry that he lied to her.)

1696
01:03:18,201 --> 01:03:20,671
You said that yours was six.

1697
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:23,607
- It's not. - I thought it was.

1698
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:25,375
I thought it was six.

1699
01:03:26,143 --> 01:03:27,344
Aren't we on the same team?

1700
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:29,112
Yes, we are.

1701
01:03:29,479 --> 01:03:32,683
You told me that yours was two. What I said was better.

1702
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,918
The difference is only one.

1703
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:37,754
Why does the difference matter?

1704
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:40,457
- I bet there's something here. - I agree.

1705
01:03:41,525 --> 01:03:43,660
(They look around.)

1706
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:45,562
- Where? - There it is.

1707
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:47,764
(They're the first to find a name sticker.)

1708
01:03:47,764 --> 01:03:49,733
- There it is. - Okay.

1709
01:03:51,134 --> 01:03:53,103
- Let's go and stick it. - Let's go. What is it?

1710
01:03:53,103 --> 01:03:54,805
- It's Jae Seok and Ji Hyo. - There's a lot.

1711
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:56,440
(They find Jae Seok and Ji Hyo's names.)

1712
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,075
- Let's go to Room 1509. - Let's stick them there.

1713
01:03:58,075 --> 01:03:59,142
Then look for more.

1714
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:01,645
Where is it? Look, Seok Jin.

1715
01:04:01,645 --> 01:04:02,713
- Where? - Seok Jin.

1716
01:04:02,746 --> 01:04:04,281
Where? This is amazing.

1717
01:04:04,281 --> 01:04:05,682
We found more. It's us.

1718
01:04:05,682 --> 01:04:07,150
(They find their own names.)

1719
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:10,554
(Stick them on the Top roulette and win Korean beef steak.)

1720
01:04:11,254 --> 01:04:12,589
(Other teams find name stickers.)

1721
01:04:12,589 --> 01:04:14,291
- We found them. - This is great.

1722
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:16,293
Let's split them just in case.

1723
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:17,394
Okay.

1724
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:19,896
- No one has been here. - Okay.

1725
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:20,897
(They're the first.)

1726
01:04:20,897 --> 01:04:24,067
Okay, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.

1727
01:04:24,067 --> 01:04:25,235
Let's stick them right away.

1728
01:04:26,803 --> 01:04:28,305
(Let's win steak and the Chance Card.)

1729
01:04:28,305 --> 01:04:30,040
- Okay. - We're safe now.

1730
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:31,341
Let's find other people's.

1731
01:04:31,808 --> 01:04:33,644
- We're on the Bottom roulette. - They're on the Top roulette.

1732
01:04:33,644 --> 01:04:35,178
Gosh, we got unlucky.

1733
01:04:35,379 --> 01:04:36,780
It's over.

1734
01:04:36,813 --> 01:04:37,981
Is it over?

1735
01:04:39,516 --> 01:04:43,420
We'll determine the winner and loser by turning the roulettes.

1736
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,556
Let's have Mina turn the Top roulette.

1737
01:04:46,723 --> 01:04:48,125
1, 2, 3.

1738
01:04:48,492 --> 01:04:50,093
That's great, Mina. Let's go.

1739
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:52,429
- Mina. - Please, Mina.

1740
01:04:52,429 --> 01:04:53,797
We have a high chance of winning.

1741
01:04:53,797 --> 01:04:54,865
(They have 3 names on the Top roulette.)

1742
01:04:56,733 --> 01:04:58,435
- No. - Don't do that.

1743
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:01,505
- Okay. - Keep going.

1744
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:03,306
- Yes! - We won!

1745
01:05:03,306 --> 01:05:05,876
(Jong Kook and Ha Ra win.)

1746
01:05:05,876 --> 01:05:07,010
We got it.

1747
01:05:07,544 --> 01:05:09,680
It's us, Ha Ra.

1748
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,481
- We had three. - We got it.

1749
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:14,117
We have four.

1750
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:15,919
We have too many.

1751
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:17,587
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's teams have 4 each.)

1752
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:19,923
Do you know how many weeks I've been eating that?

1753
01:05:19,923 --> 01:05:20,991
Drink water.

1754
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:22,659
Who would like to spin the roulette?

1755
01:05:22,893 --> 01:05:25,128
Da Hee can do it.

1756
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:26,963
- Do you trust me, Kwang Soo? - Of course.

1757
01:05:27,397 --> 01:05:29,166
Trust what? That was random.

1758
01:05:29,332 --> 01:05:31,068
In 1, 2, 3.

1759
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:32,536
Give me a fist bump.

1760
01:05:32,736 --> 01:05:36,339
(Give me some energy, my partner.)

1761
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:37,841
- She's unlucky now. - Let's go.

1762
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:40,444
(He spreads the unlucky energy.)

1763
01:05:40,444 --> 01:05:42,646
Kwang Soo has bad luck. Why did she fist bump him?

1764
01:05:43,013 --> 01:05:45,782
She's going to do poorly.

1765
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:49,653
(She spins the roulette with the unlucky energy.)

1766
01:05:49,653 --> 01:05:50,887
She's going to get unlucky because of the fist bump.

1767
01:05:50,887 --> 01:05:52,155
It won't be us.

1768
01:05:52,489 --> 01:05:53,857
But she fist bumped you.

1769
01:05:53,857 --> 01:05:55,726
- True. - Please let it be Jae Seok.

1770
01:05:56,259 --> 01:05:58,061
It's Jae Seok.

1771
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:03,400
(He gets to eat rice and seaweed for 5 weeks in a row.)

1772
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,169
You get seaweed for the fifth week.

1773
01:06:06,703 --> 01:06:11,508
(He's sick of this simple menu.)

1774
01:06:12,175 --> 01:06:14,244
Let's see your numbers.

1775
01:06:14,244 --> 01:06:15,545
This shouldn't have happened.

1776
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,581
Remember what I said?

1777
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:18,915
What is your number, Jae Seok?

1778
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,752
It's six.

1779
01:06:21,752 --> 01:06:22,986
- It's six? - See?

1780
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:25,422
- They have the highest numbers. - They have 6 and 6.

1781
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:27,657
- Her number is important. - What is your number, Ji Hyo?

1782
01:06:27,657 --> 01:06:29,259
- They have 6 and 6. - My gosh.

1783
01:06:29,793 --> 01:06:31,728
- We know now. - Isn't that incredible?

1784
01:06:31,728 --> 01:06:33,130
Hey.

1785
01:06:33,196 --> 01:06:35,532
If you have 4 or 5, you have to take theirs.

1786
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:37,467
Do rock-paper-scissors, Ha Ra and Jong Kook.

1787
01:06:37,467 --> 01:06:38,602
- You have to split. - Let's go.

1788
01:06:39,536 --> 01:06:41,304
Rock-paper-scissors

1789
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:43,473
(Ha Ra wins.)

1790
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:46,143
- We know the highest. - Yes, right.

1791
01:06:46,176 --> 01:06:49,079
- I have to decide. - Don't we know the lowest too?

1792
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:51,481
(Whose number will Ha Ra ask?)

1793
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:57,988
(She's curious.)

1794
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:03,193
(She hears the answer. What would she do?)

1795
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:04,594
I'll eat first.

1796
01:07:04,594 --> 01:07:06,296
(I'll think about it as I eat.)

1797
01:07:06,296 --> 01:07:07,397
Thank you for the food.

1798
01:07:07,531 --> 01:07:08,832
Thank you for the food.

1799
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:10,534
(Everybody but Jae Seok and Ji Hyo enjoys lunch.)

1800
01:07:10,534 --> 01:07:13,804
(The steak melts in my mouth.)

1801
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:17,007
This is not just any sandwich. It's like a dish.

1802
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:18,375
- It's really good. - Really?

1803
01:07:18,375 --> 01:07:19,876
Yes, the meat is soft.

1804
01:07:20,143 --> 01:07:21,344
Excuse me.

1805
01:07:21,945 --> 01:07:23,113
Is it good?

1806
01:07:23,113 --> 01:07:24,815
Of course. There's so much steak.

1807
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:26,016
It's so good.

1808
01:07:26,183 --> 01:07:28,018
- Is the seaweed good? - It is,

1809
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,553
but I've been having this for five weeks.

1810
01:07:29,553 --> 01:07:31,588
Put your head down, and eat.

1811
01:07:31,588 --> 01:07:33,623
- What? - Put your head down, and eat.

1812
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,659
That's rude. You want me to put my head down and eat?

1813
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:37,794
Put your head down, and eat.

1814
01:07:39,129 --> 01:07:40,463
- Here. - Jae Seok.

1815
01:07:41,631 --> 01:07:42,866
Jae Seok.

1816
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,735
(What do you think? Doesn't it look good?)

1817
01:07:45,735 --> 01:07:47,571
Stop doing that.

1818
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:49,840
It's really good.

1819
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,007
(Have some, Jae Seok.)

1820
01:07:51,775 --> 01:07:54,311
(Have my finger.)

1821
01:07:54,678 --> 01:07:57,447
(He knew it would be like this.)

1822
01:07:57,447 --> 01:07:58,949
- Hey. - That was mean.

1823
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,150
You put your finger in?

1824
01:08:00,717 --> 01:08:01,885
That was so cute.

1825
01:08:01,885 --> 01:08:03,186
Please give me a bite.

1826
01:08:03,186 --> 01:08:05,088
(Give me a bite.)

1827
01:08:05,088 --> 01:08:08,225
(Screaming)

1828
01:08:09,326 --> 01:08:10,460
(Ji Hyo joins as well.)

1829
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,461
- Jong Kook. - It's so good.

1830
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:12,929
Can I have a piece of the steak?

1831
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:14,164
You have a cold.

1832
01:08:14,197 --> 01:08:16,566
- Ha Ra has a cold as well. - He'll catch a cold.

1833
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,168
Both Ha Ra and I have a cold,

1834
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:20,604
- but why is she fine and I'm not? - He'll catch a cold.

1835
01:08:20,604 --> 01:08:22,205
- I catch colds easily. - Mina.

1836
01:08:24,507 --> 01:08:28,111
(She coughs on the steak.)

1837
01:08:28,879 --> 01:08:30,013
Da Hee.

1838
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:31,448
I'm a sea elephant.

1839
01:08:31,448 --> 01:08:34,117
(He tries to get a bite of Da Hee's sandwich.)

1840
01:08:34,117 --> 01:08:38,188
(Isn't it funny? Don't you want to give me a bite?)

1841
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,992
(Give a bite to the sea elephant.)

1842
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,260
Whose is this?

1843
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,729
(He bites into Kwang Soo's sandwich.)

1844
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:47,063
Hey.

1845
01:08:47,063 --> 01:08:48,331
There's no meat.

1846
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:50,634
Where's the meat?

1847
01:08:50,634 --> 01:08:52,669
(There's no meat in the sandwich?)

1848
01:08:52,669 --> 01:08:53,937
Where's the meat?

1849
01:08:53,937 --> 01:08:56,172
(The meat is missing. Who took it?)

1850
01:08:56,172 --> 01:08:57,674
What happened to the meat?

1851
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,309
Is it gone?

1852
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:03,613
(It was chaotic 1 minute ago.)

1853
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,916
(Lifting)

1854
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:10,520
(Da Hee grabbed the meat...)

1855
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,757
(and stole it.)

1856
01:09:13,757 --> 01:09:16,660
(She covered up her crime because Jae Seok came by.)

1857
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,929
What? What happened?

1858
01:09:19,195 --> 01:09:20,730
What happened to my meat?

1859
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:21,932
Hey.

1860
01:09:22,299 --> 01:09:23,500
(She tries to keep a poker face.)

1861
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:24,701
Did you eat mine?

1862
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,102
(She fails.)

1863
01:09:26,102 --> 01:09:27,470
Did you eat mine?

1864
01:09:28,872 --> 01:09:31,041
No, right? Where's my meat?

1865
01:09:34,077 --> 01:09:35,679
Let me see your pocket.

1866
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:37,514
You ate it, right? Open your mouth.

1867
01:09:37,781 --> 01:09:39,716
Open your mouth.

1868
01:09:39,883 --> 01:09:42,485
- Open your mouth. Where is it? - Hey.

1869
01:09:42,819 --> 01:09:44,988
- What happened to the meat? - My meat...

1870
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:49,693
(Give me my meat back.)

1871
01:09:49,693 --> 01:09:50,994
No.

1872
01:09:50,994 --> 01:09:53,029
(Justice is served.)

1873
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:56,599
(They quarrel several times today.)

1874
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:58,835
(Give me my meat.)

1875
01:09:59,803 --> 01:10:01,504
(Give me some too.)

1876
01:10:02,205 --> 01:10:03,606
(She kept the meat.)

1877
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,908
Gosh, Da Hee.

1878
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:06,876
She wasn't like that before.

1879
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,512
Da Hee wasn't like that.

1880
01:10:09,512 --> 01:10:10,914
(I like meat more as I get older.)

1881
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:12,015
Ji Hyo.

1882
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:14,150
I got some meat for you.

1883
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:16,586
Put some meat on top.

1884
01:10:17,287 --> 01:10:18,455
Look.

1885
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:20,657
(This is sad.)

1886
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:22,459
- Ji Hyo. - Goodness.

1887
01:10:22,492 --> 01:10:24,094
- I'm going to cry. - Heungbu...

1888
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,462
Heungbu is not a fictional character.

1889
01:10:25,595 --> 01:10:28,598
Don't just eat the seaweed. Eat some meat too.

1890
01:10:28,965 --> 01:10:31,034
He's so desperate.

1891
01:10:31,034 --> 01:10:32,135
- See? - My gosh.

1892
01:10:33,269 --> 01:10:34,904
(Grabbing)

1893
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:39,175
(He steals Jae Seok's food in his own way.)

1894
01:10:39,175 --> 01:10:40,377
Gosh.

1895
01:10:41,544 --> 01:10:42,879
Look at him.

1896
01:10:43,546 --> 01:10:46,616
If you're done eating, let's see what Ha Ra will do.

1897
01:10:46,616 --> 01:10:50,453
(It's time for Ha Ra to switch her teams.)

1898
01:10:51,154 --> 01:10:53,656
It's okay, Ha Ra. I've had the water bomb on me many times.

1899
01:10:53,656 --> 01:10:55,291
(It's okay, Ha Ra. I'll honor your decision.)

1900
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:57,160
I...

1901
01:10:57,794 --> 01:10:58,995
will change.

1902
01:10:58,995 --> 01:11:00,130
She's going to switch.

1903
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,364
- Yes. - With whom?

1904
01:11:01,364 --> 01:11:05,101
(Whom is she going to switch Jong Kook with?)

1905
01:11:05,101 --> 01:11:07,270
Jae Seok.

1906
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:09,005
(She wants to be a couple with Jae Seok.)

1907
01:11:09,005 --> 01:11:10,774
She has a high number too.

1908
01:11:10,774 --> 01:11:13,443
Ji Hyo and Ha Ra, please switch seats.

1909
01:11:13,676 --> 01:11:16,613
Hold on. Are Jong Kook and Ji Hyo a couple then?

1910
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:19,149
Why is it them?

1911
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,917
What? Is there something going on?

1912
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:22,285
Do we finally get to see it?

1913
01:11:22,919 --> 01:11:25,355
I didn't give her steak earlier.

1914
01:11:25,855 --> 01:11:27,891
(We're not in good terms.)

1915
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:29,426
We're not in good terms right now.

1916
01:11:30,794 --> 01:11:32,595
(She gets up.)

1917
01:11:32,595 --> 01:11:34,831
(Coughing)

1918
01:11:35,298 --> 01:11:36,466
Have a seaweed, Jong Kook.

1919
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:37,567
It's okay, Ji Hyo.

1920
01:11:37,567 --> 01:11:40,170
I have meat. Have some.

1921
01:11:40,203 --> 01:11:42,205
- Have some. - You like meat. You can have it.

1922
01:11:42,205 --> 01:11:43,273
No, it's for you.

1923
01:11:43,273 --> 01:11:44,474
You like meat.

1924
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:45,608
No, Ji Hyo. Take it.

1925
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:49,512
What's this?

1926
01:11:49,913 --> 01:11:51,114
- Are you insane? - What are you doing?

1927
01:11:51,114 --> 01:11:52,182
- What are you doing? - What's this?

1928
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,483
I'm celebrating.

1929
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:54,784
What are you doing?

1930
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,319
What's that?

1931
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:57,720
- Is he celebrating again? - Why?

1932
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:00,190
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo are back together, so it's a happy occasion.)

1933
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:01,558
- Does he want the meat? - That's for me?

1934
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:03,326
(They move to the final location now.)

1935
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:05,228
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1936
01:12:05,228 --> 01:12:06,763
(A college in Jeju Island)

1937
01:12:06,763 --> 01:12:08,698
There are...

1938
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:10,867
- so many new things in Jeju Island. - This looks awesome.

1939
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:12,569
Goodness.

1940
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:13,703
(Their eyes open wide.)

1941
01:12:13,903 --> 01:12:16,172
- This is awesome. - What's that?

1942
01:12:16,172 --> 01:12:17,273
(There are toys everywhere.)

1943
01:12:17,273 --> 01:12:19,275
- Look. - Goodness.

1944
01:12:19,542 --> 01:12:21,177
Look at the stadium.

1945
01:12:21,177 --> 01:12:23,012
(Their average age is 40, but they're still amazed.)

1946
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:24,681
These are all blocks.

1947
01:12:25,315 --> 01:12:27,684
(Is there something more?)

1948
01:12:27,684 --> 01:12:29,419
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1949
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:31,121
That's me.

1950
01:12:31,121 --> 01:12:32,655
These are blocks as well.

1951
01:12:32,655 --> 01:12:34,357
- It says "Running Man". - It does.

1952
01:12:34,357 --> 01:12:35,725
It's written here.

1953
01:12:35,725 --> 01:12:37,927
This is the final mission...

1954
01:12:37,927 --> 01:12:39,996
where you get to earn a Chance Card.

1955
01:12:39,996 --> 01:12:42,832
- We have to win here. - The winner takes all.

1956
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:46,069
The final mission is called the Pirate Roulette Quiz.

1957
01:12:46,136 --> 01:12:47,403
Because it's the pirate?

1958
01:12:47,504 --> 01:12:51,674
- Each couple gets 40 knives. - Okay.

1959
01:12:51,674 --> 01:12:53,676
Listen to the question, and if you want a chance to answer,

1960
01:12:53,676 --> 01:12:56,212
insert the number of knives you want in the Betting Pirate.

1961
01:12:56,212 --> 01:12:58,314
If the pirate doesn't pop up, you win the bet.

1962
01:12:58,314 --> 01:13:01,017
The couple who bets the most knives gets to answer.

1963
01:13:01,017 --> 01:13:03,319
I know this. I'll explain.

1964
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:04,921
But there's something else.

1965
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:06,422
(It's not that simple.)

1966
01:13:06,422 --> 01:13:08,224
You have to insert the number of knives...

1967
01:13:08,224 --> 01:13:10,860
according to the multiple choice in the Answer Pirate.

1968
01:13:11,127 --> 01:13:13,963
You only get to answer if the pirate doesn't pop up.

1969
01:13:14,797 --> 01:13:17,133
For example, if the answer is two,

1970
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:19,035
you have to insert two knives into the Answer Pirate.

1971
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:22,805
If we don't win, we lose.

1972
01:13:22,805 --> 01:13:23,840
(The couple with the most number of knives wins.)

1973
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,075
Before we start the last mission,

1974
01:13:26,075 --> 01:13:28,978
I'll tell you the highest and lowest combination of numbers.

1975
01:13:29,078 --> 01:13:31,114
The highest number combination...

1976
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:32,982
is 10.

1977
01:13:33,116 --> 01:13:34,350
- 10? - What?

1978
01:13:34,918 --> 01:13:37,086
(We have the highest numbers.)

1979
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:38,288
We were right.

1980
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,756
The lowest number combination...

1981
01:13:40,056 --> 01:13:41,958
- is 2. - 2?

1982
01:13:42,292 --> 01:13:43,793
- It's not us. - 1 and 1?

1983
01:13:43,793 --> 01:13:45,528
- Two? - Does that make sense?

1984
01:13:45,528 --> 01:13:46,629
(There's a couple who's lower than Seok Jin and So Min?)

1985
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:48,498
(The male member who had 1...)

1986
01:13:48,498 --> 01:13:50,833
(was Se Chan.)

1987
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,936
(With the Chance Card,)

1988
01:13:52,936 --> 01:13:56,406
(he got to partner up with Mina.)

1989
01:13:57,273 --> 01:13:58,441
Mina.

1990
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,777
- We don't know each other's. - We don't.

1991
01:14:00,777 --> 01:14:01,978
Excuse me.

1992
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:04,047
Mina is acting right now.

1993
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:06,216
(Look at her face.)

1994
01:14:06,216 --> 01:14:08,384
- I'm disappointed, Mina. - She's playing dumb.

1995
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:10,553
- You lied when we were eating. - What?

1996
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,189
No, you have to see the end result.

1997
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:14,724
Earlier,

1998
01:14:14,724 --> 01:14:17,794
Se Chan switched with Kwang Soo for a higher number.

1999
01:14:17,827 --> 01:14:19,495
They must be 1 and 1.

2000
01:14:19,495 --> 01:14:21,397
- It's them or them. - But...

2001
01:14:21,497 --> 01:14:22,665
it's not us.

2002
01:14:22,665 --> 01:14:24,534
You're going to reveal who's in first place, right?

2003
01:14:24,534 --> 01:14:26,903
Can you not say anything, Kwang Soo?

2004
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:28,605
- Stop saying anything. - It must be them.

2005
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:30,373
- It's them or them. - It's them.

2006
01:14:30,373 --> 01:14:32,909
It's them. She's not saying anything.

2007
01:14:33,176 --> 01:14:36,079
Da Hee is not saying anything.

2008
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:37,847
No, that's not it.

2009
01:14:37,847 --> 01:14:39,148
- What is it? - Just...

2010
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:41,751
I just want to play the game.

2011
01:14:41,751 --> 01:14:43,987
- You're the weirdest at the moment. - No.

2012
01:14:43,987 --> 01:14:45,321
What are you talking about?

2013
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:47,390
It's them.

2014
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,726
(The couple with the lowest numbers is not suspected anymore.)

2015
01:14:49,726 --> 01:14:51,928
It's Da Hee. It's in her name.

2016
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:54,597
Let's get started. We have to play first.

2017
01:14:54,664 --> 01:14:56,099
- Please give us the question. - All right.

2018
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:58,134
Here's the first question.

2019
01:14:59,068 --> 01:15:00,670
In Korean,

2020
01:15:00,803 --> 01:15:05,041
what's the word for "continuing to do the same work"?

2021
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,643
This is too easy.

2022
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:08,878
One, Gabdori.

2023
01:15:09,145 --> 01:15:11,147
Two, Samdori.

2024
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:14,617
Three, Sundori.

2025
01:15:14,617 --> 01:15:15,918
Is that it?

2026
01:15:15,918 --> 01:15:17,854
Four, Gomdori.

2027
01:15:18,421 --> 01:15:19,789
"Gomdori"?

2028
01:15:19,989 --> 01:15:21,824
Five, Baedori.

2029
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:23,693
Five! I mean, answer.

2030
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,329
(Shouting)

2031
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:27,830
I know.

2032
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:29,399
- That's not what you do. - I'm sorry.

2033
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:30,800
I'm sorry.

2034
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,402
- Do something about her. - We're not two.

2035
01:15:32,402 --> 01:15:33,469
We're not two.

2036
01:15:33,469 --> 01:15:34,771
Why is she doing that?

2037
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:36,439
I don't know. I'm sorry.

2038
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:38,274
- Why is she trying so hard to win? - She's suspicious.

2039
01:15:38,274 --> 01:15:39,475
Switch. Okay.

2040
01:15:39,475 --> 01:15:41,377
- What is wrong with her? - I'm sorry.

2041
01:15:41,377 --> 01:15:42,378
(We need to bet first, right?)

2042
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:44,847
Please bet. You can bet after saying, "answer".

2043
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:47,350
- Do you know this? - It's five, Baedori.

2044
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,384
Really?

2045
01:15:48,384 --> 01:15:49,819
- Answer. - Answer.

2046
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:50,853
How many would you like to bet?

2047
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:53,890
We'll bet seven.

2048
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,425
- That's a lot. - Answer.

2049
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:57,493
- It's too... - We'll bet eight.

2050
01:15:57,493 --> 01:15:58,561
Eight?

2051
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:00,730
If the pirate pops up, they're done for.

2052
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:04,033
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

2053
01:16:04,033 --> 01:16:05,234
- Okay. - It's my turn.

2054
01:16:05,234 --> 01:16:07,370
You have to insert all the knives.

2055
01:16:07,370 --> 01:16:08,771
It's shaking.

2056
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:10,640
Okay. One more. Please.

2057
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,508
- Please, In A. - Pop up.

2058
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,645
Okay.

2059
01:16:15,845 --> 01:16:18,448
You have to insert eight knives.

2060
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:19,916
We'll do that.

2061
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:21,417
I'm so nervous.

2062
01:16:22,118 --> 01:16:23,686
I'm nervous every time we do this.

2063
01:16:23,853 --> 01:16:26,422
- Should we take turns inserting? - Sure.

2064
01:16:26,422 --> 01:16:28,157
Pop up. I hope it explodes.

2065
01:16:28,958 --> 01:16:30,426
I want it to pop up.

2066
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:32,462
Jae Seok is nasty.

2067
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:34,964
- Kwang Soo... - Okay.

2068
01:16:34,964 --> 01:16:36,299
(Kwang Soo succeeds despite Jae Seok's remark.)

2069
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:38,234
- As long as you don't lose... - If we win, we get a chance.

2070
01:16:38,234 --> 01:16:39,902
I know. You have to be careful.

2071
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:41,604
No.

2072
01:16:41,604 --> 01:16:43,406
This is dangerous. It's risky from now on.

2073
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:45,241
We know the answer.

2074
01:16:46,576 --> 01:16:47,877
Okay.

2075
01:16:48,378 --> 01:16:49,645
One more. Let's go.

2076
01:16:49,645 --> 01:16:51,414
- Pop up. Make this fun. - Pop up.

2077
01:16:51,414 --> 01:16:52,982
Da Hee, if you lose here, you're the real star.

2078
01:16:52,982 --> 01:16:53,983
You're the best entertainer.

2079
01:16:53,983 --> 01:16:55,885
- Da Hee knows the exact answer. - The queen of variety shows.

2080
01:16:55,885 --> 01:16:58,121
- The queen of variety shows. - The queen of variety shows.

2081
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:00,089
Here I go!

2082
01:17:01,824 --> 01:17:02,892
Okay.

2083
01:17:02,892 --> 01:17:04,827
(They win by betting 8 knives.)

2084
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:08,331
- You have to bet two more. - Let's go.

2085
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:09,699
- They're doing it. - Good job.

2086
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:11,601
- Let's go. - Great.

2087
01:17:11,601 --> 01:17:14,237
- Please. - You have no choice.

2088
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:16,973
(Please)

2089
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,574
(They get one.)

2090
01:17:18,574 --> 01:17:19,776
Do the next one.

2091
01:17:20,076 --> 01:17:21,377
I think you're good at this.

2092
01:17:21,644 --> 01:17:23,079
This is unbelievable.

2093
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:25,248
Please. Please.

2094
01:17:25,748 --> 01:17:26,883
Okay.

2095
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:28,017
(Shrieking)

2096
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:32,121
(They lose the bet.)

2097
01:17:32,622 --> 01:17:34,824
(Things were going too well.)

2098
01:17:34,824 --> 01:17:36,359
(She makes weird noises.)

2099
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:41,063
Before she finished hearing the options, she knew the answer.

2100
01:17:41,864 --> 01:17:43,833
Insert the number of knives according to the multiple choice.

2101
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:49,305
(They get to answer after inserting the knives in the Answer Pirate.)

2102
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:53,042
If the pirate pops up, they're done, right?

2103
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:54,777
If the pirate pops up, they're done.

2104
01:17:55,044 --> 01:17:56,212
The answer is...

2105
01:17:56,412 --> 01:17:57,780
number two.

2106
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,115
Number two?

2107
01:17:59,115 --> 01:18:00,316
- Samdori. - Right.

2108
01:18:00,316 --> 01:18:01,684
- Samdori? - That's not true.

2109
01:18:01,684 --> 01:18:03,252
- Insert 2 knives. - Isn't it 5, Baedori?

2110
01:18:03,252 --> 01:18:04,754
- She was certain. - Really?

2111
01:18:04,754 --> 01:18:05,922
Really?

2112
01:18:06,155 --> 01:18:07,523
Isn't it Baedori?

2113
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,659
(She bet 2, instead of 5.)

2114
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,828
- Pop up. - The queen of variety shows.

2115
01:18:11,828 --> 01:18:13,696
(If they win here, they get to answer.)

2116
01:18:14,464 --> 01:18:15,598
Okay.

2117
01:18:15,998 --> 01:18:17,166
Answer?

2118
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:18,935
- What's the answer? - Maybe they're right.

2119
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:21,070
- They said Samdori. - Samdori?

2120
01:18:21,070 --> 01:18:23,573
Two, Samdori...

2121
01:18:23,906 --> 01:18:25,942
(It's wrong.)

2122
01:18:25,942 --> 01:18:27,210
It's wrong.

2123
01:18:27,477 --> 01:18:29,212
(It's not Samdori.)

2124
01:18:29,212 --> 01:18:31,347
- I think they're done. - They lost it.

2125
01:18:31,347 --> 01:18:32,448
This is awesome.

2126
01:18:32,448 --> 01:18:33,516
(They lost even more.)

2127
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:37,320
Let's get a new Betting Pirate.

2128
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:39,088
- We'll get a new one. - A new one?

2129
01:18:39,088 --> 01:18:40,456
The betting starts over?

2130
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:43,593
I'm not certain. We'll bet seven.

2131
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:45,962
- How many do we have to do? - Think about this.

2132
01:18:45,962 --> 01:18:47,163
Eight?

2133
01:18:47,897 --> 01:18:49,332
What's the answer?

2134
01:18:49,332 --> 01:18:50,466
(We lost 10 already.)

2135
01:18:50,466 --> 01:18:52,368
So what if the pirate doesn't pop up?

2136
01:18:52,368 --> 01:18:53,603
Let's go.

2137
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,004
(She's uneasy.)

2138
01:18:55,104 --> 01:18:57,106
- Please. - This one could be funny too.

2139
01:18:57,139 --> 01:18:58,574
Let's do this.

2140
01:18:58,841 --> 01:19:00,343
- Let's go. - Please.

2141
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:01,711
- This one could be funny too. - Let's go.

2142
01:19:01,711 --> 01:19:02,812
Ha Ra, one more.

2143
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:04,514
The queen of variety shows.

2144
01:19:04,514 --> 01:19:05,948
- Ha Ra. - Okay.

2145
01:19:05,948 --> 01:19:08,084
- Don't feel pressured. - Jae Seok.

2146
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:09,619
Okay, good.

2147
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:10,620
Good job.

2148
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:12,722
(Jae Seok is unusually bold, and they bet 7.)

2149
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:13,890
- Come on. - Nice.

2150
01:19:13,956 --> 01:19:15,324
This is great.

2151
01:19:15,324 --> 01:19:16,492
What's the answer?

2152
01:19:17,059 --> 01:19:18,561
Which option is it?

2153
01:19:18,694 --> 01:19:21,030
- It's 5. - It's 2.

2154
01:19:21,097 --> 01:19:23,032
- It's 5, Baedori. - 5, Baedori?

2155
01:19:23,032 --> 01:19:24,500
- Please insert the knives. - It's five, Baedori.

2156
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,936
Please pop up.

2157
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:28,304
(They have to insert 5 knives.)

2158
01:19:28,337 --> 01:19:29,872
I don't know.

2159
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:31,741
Please.

2160
01:19:31,741 --> 01:19:33,109
(She's careful.)

2161
01:19:33,809 --> 01:19:36,479
Pop up. Pop up.

2162
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,514
- There's one left. - It'll pop up.

2163
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:39,715
Please let this be funny.

2164
01:19:39,715 --> 01:19:41,517
You have many spaces left.

2165
01:19:41,517 --> 01:19:42,852
(Jae Seok is usually unlucky.)

2166
01:19:42,852 --> 01:19:44,487
Pop up.

2167
01:19:45,221 --> 01:19:46,622
- Pop up. - Gosh.

2168
01:19:46,622 --> 01:19:48,024
(They get a chance to answer.)

2169
01:19:48,024 --> 01:19:50,426
- Nice. - Five, Baedori.

2170
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:52,695
(It's wrong.)

2171
01:19:52,695 --> 01:19:53,996
- Yes. - Yes.

2172
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,432
(It's not 5?)

2173
01:19:56,432 --> 01:19:57,600
(This is so much fun.)

2174
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:02,805
This is awesome.

2175
01:20:02,872 --> 01:20:05,474
This is driving me nuts.

2176
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:07,009
What do we do now?

2177
01:20:07,209 --> 01:20:08,611
- Answer. - It's Gabdori or Samdori.

2178
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:10,012
- Answer. - We bet six.

2179
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,615
- Okay. - All right.

2180
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:14,183
Okay.

2181
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:16,118
- We'll bet. - You have to bet seven.

2182
01:20:16,118 --> 01:20:17,320
We'll bet seven.

2183
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,088
- I'll do three this time. - Can they bet?

2184
01:20:19,922 --> 01:20:21,490
Do you know the answer?

2185
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,526
- Of course. - We can bet.

2186
01:20:23,526 --> 01:20:25,595
- Of course. - I don't know.

2187
01:20:30,266 --> 01:20:31,400
Oh, dear.

2188
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:32,935
(In A does it again.)

2189
01:20:33,436 --> 01:20:34,570
(She's the new unlucky person.)

2190
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:36,806
- Put that down. - Give up your knives, Haha.

2191
01:20:37,707 --> 01:20:39,709
I thought she was lucky.

2192
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,477
(She seems to be the unlucky one.)

2193
01:20:41,477 --> 01:20:42,612
Let's bet.

2194
01:20:42,612 --> 01:20:45,014
(This is her new, hidden talent.)

2195
01:20:45,014 --> 01:20:46,315
Let's give up.

2196
01:20:46,649 --> 01:20:49,185
What's the answer?

2197
01:20:49,318 --> 01:20:50,953
We'll go with three, Sundori.

2198
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,855
Three, Sundori. Please insert the knives.

2199
01:20:53,623 --> 01:20:55,458
- Please don't pop up. - You can't pop up.

2200
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,659
It'll be really funny if it does.

2201
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,527
Goodness.

2202
01:20:58,527 --> 01:20:59,662
(It'll be really funny if it does.)

2203
01:20:59,662 --> 01:21:01,731
(Goodness)

2204
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,466
This is great. Let's do this.

2205
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:05,234
Let's bet.

2206
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:06,636
Does this make sense?

2207
01:21:06,636 --> 01:21:08,537
(Great job, Pirate.)

2208
01:21:08,537 --> 01:21:09,772
Nice.

2209
01:21:09,772 --> 01:21:11,540
We'll be done in one round.

2210
01:21:12,008 --> 01:21:15,111
It's like what I made him do for the TV rating notice.

2211
01:21:15,111 --> 01:21:16,379
His can is always empty.

2212
01:21:16,379 --> 01:21:18,047
(It's exactly like the reality.)

2213
01:21:18,047 --> 01:21:19,415
Is the can yours?

2214
01:21:19,482 --> 01:21:22,018
(The pirate is reborn again.)

2215
01:21:22,018 --> 01:21:24,053
- How many are you betting? - I'm betting seven.

2216
01:21:24,553 --> 01:21:28,024
- This is unbelievable. - We were almost there.

2217
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:33,663
(The pirate keeps on popping up.)

2218
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:36,532
This is unbelievable.

2219
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:37,967
What just happened?

2220
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,435
I'm sorry.

2221
01:21:39,435 --> 01:21:41,437
What just happened?

2222
01:21:41,437 --> 01:21:42,772
Is that even possible?

2223
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:44,840
- We'll bet seven. - Okay.

2224
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,142
Let's get it back.

2225
01:21:46,142 --> 01:21:47,510
- Ji Hyo. - I'll take three.

2226
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,145
Do four. You're lucky.

2227
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:50,713
How did you do that, Kwang Soo?

2228
01:21:51,213 --> 01:21:52,615
Do you know before you do it?

2229
01:21:52,615 --> 01:21:54,984
- It'll be awesome if it pops up. - He can't know.

2230
01:21:55,051 --> 01:21:56,452
I guess it could happen.

2231
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:57,853
Pop up.

2232
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:01,424
They're too...

2233
01:22:01,457 --> 01:22:02,892
lucky.

2234
01:22:02,892 --> 01:22:05,261
Ji Hyo, can you insert it in a bad spot?

2235
01:22:06,362 --> 01:22:07,963
(The pirate is quiet now.)

2236
01:22:07,963 --> 01:22:09,932
We'll go. We bet eight.

2237
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:11,033
Eight.

2238
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,468
Please.

2239
01:22:12,468 --> 01:22:14,170
It has to pop up.

2240
01:22:14,170 --> 01:22:16,272
It has to pop up for us.

2241
01:22:16,839 --> 01:22:18,307
It has to pop up.

2242
01:22:18,307 --> 01:22:19,775
- Slow down. - It has to pop up.

2243
01:22:20,109 --> 01:22:22,111
- Good. - It has to happen.

2244
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:23,379
It has to pop up.

2245
01:22:23,379 --> 01:22:25,748
My gosh. You potty pants.

2246
01:22:27,049 --> 01:22:28,217
(My gosh.)

2247
01:22:28,217 --> 01:22:29,885
(You potty pants.)

2248
01:22:29,885 --> 01:22:31,487
Hey.

2249
01:22:31,487 --> 01:22:33,089
- That was great. - You're so unlucky.

2250
01:22:33,589 --> 01:22:36,325
- You're so unlucky. - What is she doing now?

2251
01:22:36,358 --> 01:22:38,060
Why are you doing that all of a sudden?

2252
01:22:38,327 --> 01:22:40,830
- She's the female Kwang Soo. - This is great.

2253
01:22:41,163 --> 01:22:43,833
That was diarrhea.

2254
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,201
That was poop.

2255
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,736
Please.

2256
01:22:47,303 --> 01:22:48,704
- This is over. - The answer is...

2257
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,173
- four, Gomdori. - Gomdori?

2258
01:22:51,273 --> 01:22:52,842
Is it really Gomdori?

2259
01:22:53,976 --> 01:22:55,578
How many did we lose?

2260
01:22:55,578 --> 01:22:57,813
- That was shocking. - Wasn't that around 20?

2261
01:22:57,813 --> 01:22:59,515
- They're done. - We're done.

2262
01:22:59,515 --> 01:23:01,050
They're all done.

2263
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:03,986
Currently, first place team is...

2264
01:23:03,986 --> 01:23:05,721
Se Chan and Mina with 32 knives.

2265
01:23:07,223 --> 01:23:08,390
Us?

2266
01:23:08,457 --> 01:23:10,860
We didn't bet. They bet eight.

2267
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,195
(Here's the last question.)

2268
01:23:13,195 --> 01:23:14,764
Here's the last question.

2269
01:23:15,664 --> 01:23:17,266
(I'm going to get it right this time.)

2270
01:23:17,266 --> 01:23:21,237
During the Joseon Dynasty, if you sent this overnight...

2271
01:23:21,237 --> 01:23:25,407
from Namhansanseong Fortress to Seoul, it arrived by daybreak,

2272
01:23:25,407 --> 01:23:27,576
so it was called the Daybreak Soup.

2273
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:32,148
This is also the first delivery food in Korea. What is this?

2274
01:23:32,148 --> 01:23:33,282
Delivery food?

2275
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:35,718
- From Namhansanseong Fortress? - One, boiled pork.

2276
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:38,120
Two, trotters.

2277
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,189
Three, chicken soup.

2278
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:41,957
Four, jjajangmyeon.

2279
01:23:42,591 --> 01:23:44,226
Five, hangover soup.

2280
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:47,196
- This is difficult. - What kind of question is this?

2281
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:48,297
Answer.

2282
01:23:48,531 --> 01:23:50,166
I'll bet 10.

2283
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,868
I'll bet 11.

2284
01:23:52,868 --> 01:23:54,436
Jae Seok, do you know?

2285
01:23:54,436 --> 01:23:56,272
- We have to bet. - Let's watch.

2286
01:23:56,505 --> 01:23:58,073
Why did you bet 10?

2287
01:23:58,073 --> 01:23:59,842
It's one, boiled pork.

2288
01:23:59,842 --> 01:24:02,344
People eat it when they move, right?

2289
01:24:03,245 --> 01:24:06,448
I've delivered food. They don't deliver hangover soup.

2290
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:08,017
- Let's do this. - It's 10.

2291
01:24:08,017 --> 01:24:09,218
Let's do it together.

2292
01:24:09,718 --> 01:24:13,689
In 1, 2, 3.

2293
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:15,391
(Haha gets one.)

2294
01:24:16,091 --> 01:24:17,993
What's wrong with her?

2295
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,897
(She escapes from the reality.)

2296
01:24:21,897 --> 01:24:23,666
She's so unlucky.

2297
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:26,035
- We'll bet 11. - We are 1st.

2298
01:24:26,101 --> 01:24:28,771
In A is so unlucky.

2299
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:31,006
She's unbelievable.

2300
01:24:32,308 --> 01:24:34,043
How does that happen?

2301
01:24:34,043 --> 01:24:35,744
- Let me switch seats. - She didn't succeed once.

2302
01:24:35,744 --> 01:24:38,414
It's because I'm next to Kwang Soo.

2303
01:24:38,414 --> 01:24:39,882
Why are you blaming it on me?

2304
01:24:39,882 --> 01:24:42,618
It starts over, so you don't have to bet 11.

2305
01:24:42,618 --> 01:24:45,187
- It starts over. - We'll bet six. Answer.

2306
01:24:45,454 --> 01:24:48,224
- In A, you're unbelievable. - She's so unlucky.

2307
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:49,592
She's the female Kwang Soo.

2308
01:24:49,892 --> 01:24:51,861
She has to be on the unlucky special.

2309
01:24:53,429 --> 01:24:55,197
It always happens to her.

2310
01:24:56,432 --> 01:24:58,167
(Staring)

2311
01:24:59,835 --> 01:25:01,871
(Grabbing)

2312
01:25:02,805 --> 01:25:04,573
She transferred her energy.

2313
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:07,977
She gave him a touch of bad luck.

2314
01:25:10,579 --> 01:25:12,514
Two negatives make a positive.

2315
01:25:12,681 --> 01:25:13,816
Bad luck plus bad luck is...

2316
01:25:15,284 --> 01:25:16,852
(Bad luck plus bad luck...)

2317
01:25:16,852 --> 01:25:19,154
(plus bad luck)

2318
01:25:19,154 --> 01:25:20,256
My goodness.

2319
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,657
(I can't believe him.)

2320
01:25:21,957 --> 01:25:23,092
Then you have bad luck.

2321
01:25:23,959 --> 01:25:25,027
(Ha Ra tries to salvage the situation.)

2322
01:25:25,027 --> 01:25:26,095
Okay.

2323
01:25:26,795 --> 01:25:27,863
Please.

2324
01:25:27,863 --> 01:25:29,965
(The unlucky man, Jae Seok, begins to place his bet.)

2325
01:25:29,965 --> 01:25:30,966
The answer is one.

2326
01:25:30,966 --> 01:25:32,167
(She is sure about the answer.)

2327
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:33,335
(Does Da Hee know the answer?)

2328
01:25:33,335 --> 01:25:36,372
Trotter didn't exist back then.

2329
01:25:36,372 --> 01:25:37,840
I know how the dish came to be.

2330
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:38,841
Really?

2331
01:25:38,841 --> 01:25:40,509
Help me.

2332
01:25:40,709 --> 01:25:43,512
(Make sure no one finds out about this.)

2333
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:45,447
My goodness.

2334
01:25:45,447 --> 01:25:46,548
(He succeeds in placing 6.)

2335
01:25:46,548 --> 01:25:47,750
Who knows the answer?

2336
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:50,019
They inserted six knives.

2337
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:51,453
- We will give it a go. - We will give it a go.

2338
01:25:51,453 --> 01:25:52,955
- Seven knives. - That's a lot.

2339
01:25:54,323 --> 01:25:55,591
Why aren't we going?

2340
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:56,859
We should wait.

2341
01:25:56,859 --> 01:25:57,860
(Se Chan plans to watch the others as he is in 1st place.)

2342
01:25:57,860 --> 01:26:00,229
If the pirate pops up at our turn,

2343
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:02,031
another team will win.

2344
01:26:02,197 --> 01:26:05,301
We don't need to take that risk.

2345
01:26:05,901 --> 01:26:08,203
Da Hee knows the answer to this question.

2346
01:26:08,203 --> 01:26:09,905
Da Hee knows the origin of every dish.

2347
01:26:09,905 --> 01:26:11,106
- Really? - Yes.

2348
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:13,008
Not every dish.

2349
01:26:13,442 --> 01:26:16,045
The pirate will pop up.

2350
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,112
Da Hee will make the pirate pop up.

2351
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:18,847
They might fail.

2352
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:22,217
Let's insert the knives together and share the responsibility.

2353
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:24,019
- Okay. - That's a good idea.

2354
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:25,387
(If that's what you want, I can oblige.)

2355
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:26,488
All right.

2356
01:26:27,356 --> 01:26:29,191
Let's insert at the count of three.

2357
01:26:29,191 --> 01:26:30,392
In 1, 2, 3.

2358
01:26:30,392 --> 01:26:33,128
(Da Hee inserts hers, but Kwang Soo doesn't.)

2359
01:26:33,228 --> 01:26:34,797
In 1, 2, 3.

2360
01:26:34,964 --> 01:26:38,033
You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?

2361
01:26:40,269 --> 01:26:43,839
(You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?)

2362
01:26:43,839 --> 01:26:45,507
(An utter jerk)

2363
01:26:45,774 --> 01:26:48,377
(She calls him an utter jerk in a fit of anger.)

2364
01:26:48,377 --> 01:26:49,478
An utter jerk!

2365
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:53,415
"You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?"

2366
01:26:53,515 --> 01:26:55,250
Today,

2367
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,988
Da Hee even made a popular phrase.

2368
01:26:59,488 --> 01:27:03,125
"You are so mean. You are an utter jerk, aren't you?"

2369
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:05,227
I am sorry. I will insert my knife.

2370
01:27:06,295 --> 01:27:07,696
Go.

2371
01:27:07,863 --> 01:27:09,031
No, no.

2372
01:27:10,899 --> 01:27:12,468
Go.

2373
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:13,602
No, no.

2374
01:27:16,572 --> 01:27:17,673
Okay!

2375
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:19,241
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee succeed in betting 7 knives.)

2376
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:21,110
Da Hee knows the origin of every dish.

2377
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:22,478
No, I don't.

2378
01:27:22,478 --> 01:27:24,146
Jae Seok, are you going to bet more?

2379
01:27:24,146 --> 01:27:25,180
(13 out of 24 slots are filled.)

2380
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:27,316
Jae Seok. Jae Seok. Are you going to bet more?

2381
01:27:27,316 --> 01:27:29,051
- That's a good idea. - Are you going to bet more?

2382
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:30,652
- What? - Are you going to bet more?

2383
01:27:30,652 --> 01:27:32,855
- He is highly likely to fail. - Are you going to bet more?

2384
01:27:32,855 --> 01:27:33,922
Let me tell you this.

2385
01:27:33,922 --> 01:27:36,158
If we answer first, we will get the question right.

2386
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:37,393
- Is that so? - Yes.

2387
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,961
- Go. - Let's go.

2388
01:27:39,528 --> 01:27:40,662
Go.

2389
01:27:40,662 --> 01:27:42,297
- Let's go, Jae Seok. - Let's go.

2390
01:27:42,297 --> 01:27:44,466
Let's go. You know the answer.

2391
01:27:44,733 --> 01:27:46,168
The pirate might pop up.

2392
01:27:46,168 --> 01:27:47,403
It's okay. Let's go.

2393
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:50,839
Ha Ra won't pick the wrong slot.

2394
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,209
Ha Ra, go.

2395
01:27:55,511 --> 01:27:57,012
Ha Ra is sleeping.

2396
01:27:57,012 --> 01:27:58,313
I feel like she is inserting it in my stomach.

2397
01:27:58,313 --> 01:28:00,449
Hold on. For goodness' sake.

2398
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:01,950
It's okay.

2399
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,752
Didn't she sound like a middle-aged woman just now?

2400
01:28:03,752 --> 01:28:05,154
Hold on.

2401
01:28:05,654 --> 01:28:08,624
(Hold on, Pirate.)

2402
01:28:09,725 --> 01:28:11,126
Hold on.

2403
01:28:11,493 --> 01:28:13,495
(Ha Ra succeeds.)

2404
01:28:13,729 --> 01:28:16,298
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

2405
01:28:16,298 --> 01:28:18,067
There aren't a lot of open slots.

2406
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,668
(While 9 slots remain,)

2407
01:28:19,668 --> 01:28:20,669
(Kwang Hee puts his faith in Da Hee and bets more.)

2408
01:28:20,669 --> 01:28:23,605
- We will bet more. - They are cool.

2409
01:28:23,672 --> 01:28:25,207
I hope it pops up.

2410
01:28:26,942 --> 01:28:28,343
Do you want to insert together?

2411
01:28:28,343 --> 01:28:29,478
- Okay. - Do you promise?

2412
01:28:30,913 --> 01:28:33,348
Insert the knife on my mark this time.

2413
01:28:33,348 --> 01:28:35,050
If they insert the knives together, they will share the responsibility.

2414
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:36,585
That's why I suggested it.

2415
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:40,055
- If we do this, we will win. - We can do this.

2416
01:28:40,155 --> 01:28:41,924
Insert it at the count of three.

2417
01:28:41,924 --> 01:28:44,159
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2418
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:45,494
(Victory depends on the last question.)

2419
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:46,795
(Since she claims to know the answer,)

2420
01:28:46,795 --> 01:28:48,931
(the tall ones decide to take a leap of faith.)

2421
01:28:48,931 --> 01:28:50,499
In 1, 2, 3.

2422
01:28:51,133 --> 01:28:53,902
- I can't believe you! - No, no.

2423
01:28:53,902 --> 01:28:55,571
(Kwang Soo's hand doesn't move.)

2424
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:59,408
I missed my cue. I missed my cue.

2425
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:00,476
Hey,

2426
01:29:00,476 --> 01:29:03,445
how could you miss the cue when I counted to three?

2427
01:29:03,445 --> 01:29:05,914
It happened too quickly.

2428
01:29:05,914 --> 01:29:09,351
Had you said it slowly, I would've done it correctly.

2429
01:29:09,351 --> 01:29:12,521
She is so cute. My goodness.

2430
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:14,823
In 1, 2, 3. Then you insert.

2431
01:29:14,823 --> 01:29:17,326
You should have said it slowly.

2432
01:29:17,326 --> 01:29:19,228
- You went, "In 1, 2, 3." - You are an utter jerk.

2433
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:20,662
- It happened too quickly. - You are an utter jerk.

2434
01:29:20,662 --> 01:29:22,364
Hurry up, and insert the knife. I will watch you.

2435
01:29:22,364 --> 01:29:23,732
I didn't pick the bad slot.

2436
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:26,001
- I didn't pick the bad slot. - This is driving me crazy.

2437
01:29:26,468 --> 01:29:28,637
(A big shadow watches the utter jerk.)

2438
01:29:28,637 --> 01:29:29,738
It will pop up.

2439
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:31,039
It will pop up.

2440
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:32,107
(Serious)

2441
01:29:32,107 --> 01:29:35,744
Kwang Soo, I will be really angry if you make it pop up.

2442
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:37,579
She will be through with you.

2443
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,149
Da Hee knows the answer.

2444
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:41,150
(Kwang Soo meets the biggest crisis.)

2445
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,918
(What is his fate?)

2446
01:29:42,918 --> 01:29:44,286
(Next week)

2447
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,822
(The unlucky ones strike.)

2448
01:29:46,822 --> 01:29:49,958
(This is the curse of pirate roulette game.)

2449
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,628
(What will become of the fire moth couple?)

2450
01:29:53,095 --> 01:29:54,963
(The 2nd Jeju Island Special, Hopscotch Race)

2451
01:29:55,297 --> 01:29:58,467
(Jae Seok's team and Seok Jin's team have a face-off.)

2452
01:29:58,467 --> 01:30:01,303
(Who will take the attractions of Jeju Island?)

2453
01:30:01,303 --> 01:30:04,339
(They are serious.)

2454
01:30:04,339 --> 01:30:07,509
(This piece of land is ours.)

2455
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:09,678
(We can't let you have it.)

2456
01:30:09,678 --> 01:30:11,813
(They have a scramble to take more land in Jeju Island.)

2457
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:13,749
(Is there a traitor in the team?)

2458
01:30:14,116 --> 01:30:16,785
(The sly traitors aim to sell the land,)

2459
01:30:16,785 --> 01:30:19,221
(and the loyal strategists aim to defend the land.)

2460
01:30:20,088 --> 01:30:23,458
(Who will come out on top in this dirty fight?)

2461
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:24,927
