00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:10,447
Skip to 1:20

2
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:28,195
- My gosh, that looks good. - Is that so?

3
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,460
We can't eat a lot here.

4
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,720
- We should order two bowls. - Let's do that. Let's share.

5
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,200
- Let's share them. - We can save money too.

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,140
I can order. Tell the server that we're ready.

7
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:38,910
This isn't hard.

8
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:41,575
- Ordering food isn't that hard. - Excuse me.

9
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,040
- Soba, soba. - Soba?

10
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,770
- The best soba. - The best soba?

11
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,270
- Give us two bowls. - Yes, the best soba.

12
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,470
- 2 bowls, please. - 2 bowls.

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,440
(Two bowls?)

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,480
Thank you.

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,455
I didn't remember "two". I almost said, "this and this".

16
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:57,250
(This and this, please.)

17
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,620
- What does that mean? - "This and this".

18
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
It means, this and this.

19
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,230
- This and this? - Hey, but we are in trouble.

20
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,300
If this goes wrong, we'll end up eating too much.

21
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,205
This is my fourth meal.

22
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:11,200
(They started eating from Incheon International Airport.)

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,660
(He even ate the in-flight meal.)

24
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,245
How many meals will I eat today?

25
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,430
- We're going to get full. - Soba is served.

26
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,615
Here it is.

27
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:20,215
- It was fast. - My gosh.

28
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:25,825
(Okinawa soba made with flour and pork broth is flavorful.)

29
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:27,725
Did we order one with hot soup?

30
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,025
I wanted to eat cold soba.

31
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,250
We can slurp cold soba though.

32
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,950
I wanted to eat cold soba.

33
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,550
- This must be the trotter. - Thank you.

34
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,560
- Thank you. - Isn't that a perilla leaf?

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,920
- Yes, it is. - I wanted to eat cold soba.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,900
Hey, we are supposed to use individual bowls for this.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,175
- What? - My goodness.

38
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,615
- What? - My goodness.

39
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,545
We only ordered two bowls.

40
00:02:51,455 --> 00:02:53,970
(They already have 2 bowls. There are 2 more bowls of soba?)

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,115
That...

42
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,425
- We only ordered two. - Earlier, how many...

43
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,155
- Is that on the house? - Is it?

44
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:02,525
- Is that on the house? - What are you talking about?

45
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:04,650
- Thank you. - Sure.

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,020
(They must eat 1 bowl each. What on earth just happened?)

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,150
- This is bad. - I'm so flustered.

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,565
- Excuse me. Is this steak? - Hey.

49
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:17,445
Because we repeated, "2 bowls", it's 4 bowls in total.

50
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,370
(When they were ordering earlier,)

51
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,470
(two bowls of soba...)

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,670
(were put together with two more bowls.)

53
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,415
(I see. They want to order four bowls in total.)

54
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:30,380
(Everyone kept saying, "two bowls".)

55
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,710
- One person should order. - Hey.

56
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,450
- Hey, you. - I said it once. He repeated it.

57
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,725
- We have four bowls now. - I mean...

58
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:39,520
- Come on. This is ludicrous. - Seriously.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,890
I don't like hot soup. I like cold soup.

60
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,560
- Drop it. - You ordered the wrong one.

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,060
- The chunk of meat is big too. - It's hard to eat now.

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,290
- This is crazy. What will I do? - My gosh.

63
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,360
Four bowls of soba are too much.

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,530
- We should've ordered only one. - We should have.

65
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,975
We should have ordered one.

66
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:57,285
It's good, but...

67
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,100
- It is good. - It tastes like ramyeon.

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,515
(It's chewy and delicious though.)

69
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:06,255
We were supposed to order cold soba.

70
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:11,265
I asked the owner. Okinawa soba isn't cold.

71
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:13,650
- There isn't cold soba here. - It's different from Kyoto soba.

72
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,530
What if someone else recommends us soba?

73
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:18,405
- Then I'll order cold soba. - We can't go to the same place.

74
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,460
You'll have to go to the restaurant the person recommends you.

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,860
- This is crazy. - Let's eat cold soba next then.

76
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,660
- No, only in Kyoto... - There isn't cold soba in Okinawa.

77
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,015
- You can find it in Kyoto. - No, there must be.

78
00:04:28,255 --> 00:04:32,100
You were happy that Japan was close. Now, you're all grumpy.

79
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,770
This isn't to my liking.

80
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,185
(I'll be honest.)

81
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:39,280
- You know? - You don't seem to like it.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,450
- I want to eat something good too. - This is why...

83
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,465
This is why everyone criticizes him.

84
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,650
- You saw, right? He was elated. - I want to really enjoy this too.

85
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,920
- He has mood swings. - I must've reached menopause.

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,265
I have mood swings now.

87
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,830
- You finished eating soba. - Okay.

88
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,200
We'll spin the globe now.

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,860
- We have to spin it again. - Are we going to do it here?

90
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,670
- Let's do well this time. - So Min, you practiced this.

91
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,145
You have to say, "Start."

92
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,800
- We only have one chance. - Can I practice once?

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,470
- You want to practice once? - All right.

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,640
Hold this. Hold it.

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,315
(As she feels nervous and anxious, she practices first.)

96
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:14,010
(Cashier at a convenience store)

97
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,850
- That was great. - The cashier is a nice choice.

98
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,720
- Cashier at a convenience store. - Okay.

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,090
Okay, everyone. You can go outside, find a convenience store, and ask.

100
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,795
- Let's get out. - We did it.

101
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,235
- Okay. - Let's hurry.

102
00:05:25,445 --> 00:05:28,075
The producer is a bit scatterbrained because he didn't get much sleep.

103
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,740
The bill. We almost forgot the bill.

104
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,060
We definitely said we were practicing.

105
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,700
We said it was a practice, but the producer...

106
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,310
- My gosh, this is great. - Let's go out.

107
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,110
- Okay. - Where did Seok Jin go?

108
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,570
(Seok Jin went to the bathroom.)

109
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,415
He's high-maintenance.

110
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,110
- He really is. - It's too tight here.

111
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,280
We have to eat Japanese rice balls since we are here.

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
- What? - Rice balls.

113
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,695
Whatever they are, I can't eat anymore today.

114
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:52,495
If we keep this up, I might...

115
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,665
I might poop on the street.

116
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:57,160
(Jae Seok gets close to taking care of his business on the street.)

117
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
- We ate too much. - That'd be horrible.

118
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,160
Jae Seok, I feel really gassy now.

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,175
Exactly. I think I heard you fart a few times, but pretended I didn't.

120
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,530
It was one of those silent farts.

121
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,570
I got the feeling that she was full too. She's in trouble too.

122
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,970
It's just that we didn't talk about this. She keeps farting.

123
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,470
We ate so much. I've never eaten this much in my life.

124
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,040
- Do we need to do more? - It's 7:25pm.

125
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,180
It's hard for us to get on a plane tonight.

126
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,080
- Won't the restaurants close soon? - What?

127
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,350
- Won't they close soon? - In my opinion,

128
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,920
we can try one more place.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,050
If we succeed today but can't find a flight back to Korea,

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,660
- we can go back tomorrow morning. - We can return in the morning.

131
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,730
- Seriously. - Should we get going?

132
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,040
Why can't I find a convenience store?

133
00:06:36,045 --> 00:06:37,860
- Usually, there are tons here. - I can't find a single one.

134
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,660
- Okinawa. - What is this?

135
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,615
- That's pizza. - This is an empty street.

136
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:44,915
Why can't we find a convenience store? Japan has a lot of them.

137
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,540
- Seriously. Not even a single one. - This is quite flustering.

138
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
We shouldn't be walking aimlessly. Think about our step counters.

139
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,180
Here's the store. It's like a supermarket.

140
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
- Here is the convenience store. - "Food Market".

141
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,210
- This isn't a convenience store. - Let's see if they're doing well.

142
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,350
(That's a market.)

143
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,450
- They are the same. - They are interchangeable.

144
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,990
- They aren't? - We have step counters. Come on.

145
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,100
- Until when must we walk? - What are we doing here?

146
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,260
- Market and convenience stores... - Aren't they the same thing?

147
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,760
(My gosh, you're picky.)

148
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,960
My gosh, I can't find a convenience store here.

149
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,705
- Hold on. Producer Jung. - Why can't we find one?

150
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't take us without a plan.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you doing to us?

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,670
You should ask and find one nearby.

153
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,855
Hold on. Who is this? Someone keeps farting when we're walking.

154
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:30,050
My gosh, someone keeps farting in front of us.

155
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,180
Hold on a second. Stop right here.

156
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,595
Hey, wait a minute. This is serious.

157
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:37,360
Hold on. Which one of you keeps farting in front of the group?

158
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,405
- It's not me. - Seok Jin.

159
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:41,405
- Seok Jin. - Seriously.

160
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:44,630
- Who's doing that? - At the immigration checkpoint,

161
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,445
Seok Jin let me go before him. He has never done that for me.

162
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:51,040
- I wondered why he was generous. - No.

163
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,740
- Seok Jin. - It's because he farted.

164
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,740
You've gotten the wrong idea. It was not me.

165
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,280
- Everyone. - If it smells this bad,

166
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,040
- In front of us... - it means you need to poop soon.

167
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,195
Front of us...

168
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,450
- It will turn into poop soon. - Why do you keep doing that?

169
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,695
Excuse me. I'll be honest. Japanese food doesn't agree with me.

170
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:10,290
To be honest, it doesn't agree with me.

171
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,520
- I don't care about a food trip. - I am sorry, but...

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,935
I want to eat kimchi jjigae.

173
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,490
I want to eat kimchi jjigae.

174
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,530
Seok Jin.

175
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,200
- Why? - Don't keep walking in front of us.

176
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,230
- Fall back to fart. - Fall back to fart.

177
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,145
All of us have upset stomachs.

178
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:28,540
- Let's mind our manners. - Okay.

179
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,810
- Mind your manners, and fall back. - Let's bring our hands together.

180
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,410
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

181
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,150
- Let's go. - Let's go. Let's keep going.

182
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,395
(Do they think it will help?)

183
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,125
Isn't that a convenience store?

184
00:08:37,965 --> 00:08:39,550
- You are right. It's Lawson. - Is it a convenience store?

185
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,950
(They finally find a convenience store.)

186
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,420
He looks like he would like steak.

187
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,130
(They find an employee they have a good feeling about.)

188
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,330
(They succeed the mission if he recommends steak.)

189
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,460
If there are no flights tonight after we succeed the mission,

190
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,345
- we can take a flight tomorrow. - We can take a flight tomorrow.

191
00:08:57,785 --> 00:08:59,670
(They buy a few items.)

192
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,740
Ask him.

193
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,210
(Kyeong Hwan takes the lead and asks.)

194
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,485
Excuse me.

195
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:10,950
(Is he speaking the Gyeongsang dialect?)

196
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,480
(Staccato)

197
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,550
(Stuttering)

198
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,420
(Staccato)

199
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,290
(He asks the question,)

200
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,630
("Please recommend us a dish and a restaurant.")

201
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,500
(They succeed the mission if he recommends steak.)

202
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,170
(Which dish will the employee recommend?)

203
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,485
Ramen.

204
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,510
Ramen.

205
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,370
(He recommends ramen.)

206
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,540
- Ramen? - Ramen?

207
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,825
(They doubt their ears.)

208
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,680
(Do they need to eat noodles again?)

209
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,165
- Stop it. - Ramen?

210
00:09:45,205 --> 00:09:47,390
- Ramen? - I see.

211
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,065
There is a good restaurant nearby.

212
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,605
(Frustrated)

213
00:09:53,075 --> 00:09:54,790
Thank you.

214
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,160
Which ramen restaurant?

215
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,605
He is kind.

216
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,505
He is drawing us a map.

217
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,100
Thank you.

218
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,440
(They thank the kind employee and head to the ramen restaurant.)

219
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,745
Who knew it'd be ramen?

220
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,055
- Ramen. - We need to eat noodles again.

221
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,440
(At 8pm, they head to the ramen restaurant.)

222
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,955
That must be the ramen restaurant...

223
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:14,650
- at the corner. - The lights are on.

224
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,980
- There it is. - I am so full.

225
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,320
(They find the ramen restaurant in a quiet alley.)

226
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,690
(How does it taste?)

227
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,390
He makes it on the spot.

228
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:29,475
(The harmony of rich chicken broth and freshly-cooked noodles)

229
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,230
(The specialty of Okinawa, chicken ramen, is served.)

230
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,705
Thank you.

231
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:35,640
- It smells good. - It smells good.

232
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,415
It looks delicious.

233
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:40,200
(Chicken ramen is a noodle dish with chicken broth and pork.)

234
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,885
This one has lighter broth.

235
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,125
Does the seafood ramen taste okay?

236
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:46,580
Does the seafood ramen taste good?

237
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,995
(No matter how full they are, they always welcome tasty noodles.)

238
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:53,280
(The dish suits Seok Jin's taste.)

239
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,535
This is...

240
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:57,020
tastier than soba.

241
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,720
- It's really tasty. - The tasty dish...

242
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,160
makes me want to go out for another round.

243
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,435
(He clears the bowl in an instant.)

244
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:08,030
Let's call it a night and start tomorrow morning.

245
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,615
Thank you.

246
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,240
It's an incredibly tasty dish.

247
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,340
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

248
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,055
(It's very tasty.)

249
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,485
The day ended after two meals.

250
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,980
I am so full.

251
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,280
The day ended after a series of meals.

252
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,680
It looks like...

253
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,920
we are 15-minute walk away from the hotel.

254
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
- This is a countryside. - Let's take a taxi.

255
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,150
We should take a taxi.

256
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,790
Why don't we ask the taxi driver?

257
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,305
- Ask what? - The mission question.

258
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:36,960
The menu.

259
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,130
- You want to practice? - Yes. Let's practice.

260
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,715
- Will anyone recommend steak? - Excuse me.

261
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:49,085
Please recommend us a dish and a restaurant.

262
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:52,520
Okinawa soba.

263
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,810
- Soba? - It's soba again.

264
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,950
(Okinawa soba)

265
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,920
- Soba. - Soba.

266
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,670
Most people recommend Okinawa soba.

267
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:02,435
If number one is soba,

268
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:05,060
- what is number 2? - Number 2?

269
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
What would it be?

270
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,060
I guess it's steak.

271
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,560
- Steak. - I guess it's steak.

272
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,730
Steak.

273
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,030
He recommended steak.

274
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,440
We might have better luck tomorrow.

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,800
That's it.

276
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,470
(They arrive at the hotel.)

277
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,240
- It's clean. - It's nice.

278
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,925
Thank you.

279
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:28,380
Your mission is over for the day.

280
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,050
- We will have to stop. - The restaurants are closed.

281
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,965
- The restaurants are closed. - We are exhausted.

282
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:35,590
We will check the step counters before you go into the hotel.

283
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,920
The step counter.

284
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,135
Mine is strange. The count goes up even when I stand still.

285
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,675
- Okay. - You don't stand still.

286
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:44,945
When you go to bed, wear the step counter.

287
00:12:45,445 --> 00:12:48,170
Do we need to wear it to bed?

288
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,800
Are we the only ones who have to do this?

289
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,145
- Other teams... - They have to do it, too.

290
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:54,185
If the count is 20,000 when you wake up, you are sleeping.

291
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:57,310
- Where should I wear it? - I have no spare clothes.

292
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,810
- Where should I wear it? - I don't know what to do.

293
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,325
- What? - We have no spare clothes.

294
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,380
- Hold on. - Seriously.

295
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,825
Producer.

296
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,465
How am I supposed to wear it when I have no spare clothes?

297
00:13:08,575 --> 00:13:10,450
Wear it on your hair.

298
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,660
Wear it on your hair like a hairpin.

299
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,275
We can't sleep in these clothes.

300
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:19,830
(They check in at the lobby.)

301
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,415
Are there three beds?

302
00:13:21,485 --> 00:13:23,145
- Are there three beds? - Yes.

303
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,770
Beds. 1, 1, and 1.

304
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,240
(He chimes in.)

305
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,485
(Laughing)

306
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:29,815
1 bed. 2 rooms.

307
00:13:29,955 --> 00:13:31,910
They might give you six beds.

308
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,080
- 3 beds. 3 beds. - Don't say anything.

309
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,680
- Don't confuse him. - We can draw a picture.

310
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,750
Don't say anything.

311
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,625
- Thank you. Bye. - Thank you.

312
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,590
(White room and men in white)

313
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,720
Steak.

314
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,460
- It's steak. - It's steak.

315
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,630
(There is steak on TV.)

316
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,060
We will eat it tomorrow.

317
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,160
(This trip ends when we eat it.)

318
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,280
Is that an iron griddle?

319
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,400
- That's what we need to eat. - That's what we need to eat.

320
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,170
That's what we need to eat.

321
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,400
I hope we don't get another recommendation for soba.

322
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,540
(He takes off the camera and films the TV.)

323
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,720
I will film it.

324
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,855
The camera needs to film us.

325
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:05,080
I want to film steak.

326
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,225
- Did I position it right? - Yes, you did.

327
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,335
We are like Andre Kim.

328
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,490
(3 men in white)

329
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,965
We are dressed in white.

330
00:14:18,705 --> 00:14:20,890
It looks oily.

331
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,360
I bet it tastes delicious.

332
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,445
(They fall asleep and dream about steak.)

333
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:30,100
(They feel like they will be able to take the morning flight.)

334
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,415
- The weather is amazing. - It's refreshing.

335
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,010
The sunlight is nice.

336
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,685
You know,

337
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,440
that's the International Street.

338
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,295
It's the busiest street in Okinawa.

339
00:14:41,535 --> 00:14:42,650
Let's go.

340
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,395
This place makes me really feel like I am in Japan.

341
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:46,865
This place...

342
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,590
- is Japan through and through. - Seriously.

343
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,865
(International street has souvenir shops, restaurants, etc.)

344
00:14:50,905 --> 00:14:52,890
- I am in a good mood. - Me too.

345
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,390
(Seok Jin is in a good mood.)

346
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,490
Coming to the International Street put me in a good mood.

347
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,830
(Seok Jin's mood is very different from yesterday.)

348
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,030
There is steak everywhere.

349
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,745
- This restaurant serves steak. - There is steak everywhere.

350
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:08,215
(People in the International Street are bound to recommend steak.)

351
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:11,180
- It's time to spin the globe. - My goodness.

352
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,625
(The globe that will seal their fate appears.)

353
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:16,325
Who wants to go?

354
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:17,620
I will go.

355
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,550
- Celebrate 10,000 counts. - I will celebrate 10,000 counts.

356
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,950
- I will celebrate 10,000 counts. - We will start right away.

357
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,020
- We will start right away. - Yes.

358
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,150
In 1, 2, 3. Start.

359
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,105
The man with 10,000 counts will go.

360
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:31,430
(Who is the first person to recommend a dish?)

361
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,030
- The step counter... - What is it?

362
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,130
A convenience store employee.

363
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,230
(It's a lucky choice.)

364
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,670
- A convenience store employee. - That's good.

365
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,400
- We are off to a good start. - It's not bad.

366
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,710
Someone whose last name is Suzuki or people who are over 90...

367
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,755
- are difficult choices. - Let's go.

368
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:47,610
There must be a lot of convenience stores.

369
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,810
I found one. It's a convenience store, right?

370
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,980
(They find a convenience store right away.)

371
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,095
It's a convenience store.

372
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,520
Steak.

373
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,950
- It's a busy street. - Steak.

374
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,260
Steak. Steak.

375
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,935
(There is a steakhouse in front of the convenience store.)

376
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:03,290
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

377
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,100
(They enter the convenience store with hope.)

378
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,200
Hi.

379
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,530
(Whom should we ask?)

380
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,175
Who wants to ask?

381
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:11,740
Let's ask him.

382
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,900
Hi.

383
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,310
(A male employee is bound to prefer steak.)

384
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,825
He is an employee. I will ask him.

385
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,055
Excuse me.

386
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:28,535
Please recommend us a dish and a restaurant.

387
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:38,230
(The International Street is full of steakhouses.)

388
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,230
(Let's see if the employee recommends steak.)

389
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,330
Osoba.

390
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,585
Osoba?

391
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:47,940
Osoba?

392
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
(Osoba is soba with an honorific, O.)

393
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,280
It's soba, but he added an honorific, O.

394
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,580
Soba?

395
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,925
Soba. Yes.

396
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:57,480
(Are you serious?)

397
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,025
(I am serious.)

398
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:02,250
(Their prayer to get something other than soba goes unanswered.)

399
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,350
Soba.

400
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,540
(She is in a daze.)

401
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,790
You know...

402
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,060
(This can't be real.)

403
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,705
Most people recommend soba.

404
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:11,530
Please recommend us a restaurant.

405
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,440
Please ask him to recommend us a restaurant.

406
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,670
The best restaurant. The best restaurant.

407
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,185
- The best? - Yes.

408
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:21,290
I recommend C restaurant.

409
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,215
Please give us the address.

410
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:25,720
Everyone is so kind...

411
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,895
- to draw us a map. - I know.

412
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,690
This is the restaurant.

413
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,180
Thank you.

414
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,480
- Soba? - Soba.

415
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,790
- Thank you. - There are set menus.

416
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,820
- Thank you. - Thank you.

417
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,135
Bye.

418
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:41,390
We still have soba in our stomachs...

419
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,470
from yesterday.

420
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,630
- This is crazy. - Had you chosen soba,

421
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,205
this mission would have ended yesterday.

422
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:48,640
That's true.

423
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,900
- We would be in Seoul already. - I told you.

424
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,070
Listen.

425
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,600
At the airport,

426
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,910
- I said we should eat soba. - When did this happen?

427
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,685
- I said we should eat soba, right? - Did you?

428
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,980
(They talked about a dish they wanted to eat at Naha Airport.)

429
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,350
Let's eat this. Okinawa soba.

430
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,020
We need meat.

431
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,795
(We should eat meat.)

432
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,220
- Didn't I mention soba? - Did you?

433
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,260
(He gets angry.)

434
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,390
- I'm not lying. - You...

435
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,590
You said it, but we all mentioned it.

436
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,690
- Seriously. - Right.

437
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's go to the restaurant that he recommended.

438
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,745
(Let's go to the best soba restaurant.)

439
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:26,145
(They ask for directions.)

440
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:33,625
(It's difficult to find locals who know the restaurant.)

441
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:39,480
- Do you know this soba restaurant? - A soba restaurant?

442
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,695
- Right. - Yes, I know this restaurant.

443
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:45,360
- Soba restaurant? - I think she knows.

444
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,920
- She knows. - I think she does.

445
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,460
- Is it delicious? - Yes.

446
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,535
- Is it delicious? - Yes, it is.

447
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:55,640
- Is it the same as Okinawa soba? - It's quite far.

448
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,100
Yes, it's Okinawa soba.

449
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,420
- I see. - Is it Okinawa soba?

450
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:06,620
- What else do they have? - Okay.

451
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,480
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

452
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,065
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

453
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:17,495
(They get on a taxi.)

454
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,490
- Okay. - Let's go.

455
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,205
Excuse us.

456
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,860
- Where's the address? - I have it.

457
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,400
- There we go. - All right.

458
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,500
Anyway, we had soba yesterday.

459
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,745
We also have soba today.

460
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,510
This will be our last soba.

461
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,110
Let's make plans while we eat.

462
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,385
I think it'll be delicious.

463
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:40,140
I also think that it'll be tasty.

464
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,725
I'm certain of it.

465
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:46,650
(They ride the taxi for a while.)

466
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,090
I have a bad feeling. It's the mart that we passed yesterday.

467
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,505
- Really? - Yes.

468
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,520
It's the mart that we passed yesterday.

469
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,835
- Really? - Yes.

470
00:19:55,575 --> 00:19:58,460
(Looking for a convenience store last night)

471
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,645
(It's yesterday's market which looks quite familiar.)

472
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,270
- Don't say that. - I'm sure.

473
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,310
Don't ever say that.

474
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,370
- Stop talking nonsense. - I'm serious.

475
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,340
- That's nonsense. - We passed by this street.

476
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,540
In Japan...

477
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,150
- Isn't the restaurant on the left? - That's nonsense.

478
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,380
The neighborhoods are...

479
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,950
- We passed by that street. - Hey.

480
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,695
Isn't that the restaurant?

481
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:25,190
Isn't that the restaurant?

482
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,860
(Is it the same restaurant as yesterday's?)

483
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:34,915
(It's the Okinawa soba restaurant that they went to yesterday.)

484
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,215
- My goodness. - Gosh.

485
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,245
Is this the place?

486
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,845
Oh, my goodness.

487
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:43,055
Oh, my goodness.

488
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,440
No way.

489
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,855
(There's no way.)

490
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:49,950
- Is that really it? - Listen.

491
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,325
Did we just arrive at the airport?

492
00:20:53,435 --> 00:20:55,120
I can't believe it.

493
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,150
(Seok Jin didn't like the soba yesterday.)

494
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,535
Is this the right place?

495
00:20:58,445 --> 00:21:00,465
How could this happen?

496
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,990
(Time is the only thing that changed.)

497
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,500
Where are you going? It's this way.

498
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,060
Come this way.

499
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,470
- Are we back? - Are we really back here again?

500
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,930
Come on. It's here.

501
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,370
How is this possible?

502
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,515
We went out to the city.

503
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:17,855
- How are we back here? - I've seen this before.

504
00:21:18,265 --> 00:21:20,040
(Screaming)

505
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,990
It's like we're in a maze.

506
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,125
I'm only a guest, so I'm leaving.

507
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,695
To be honest,

508
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,465
can't I just leave?

509
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,420
I'm excited.

510
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,560
(Team Between Friends is on three missions in Thailand.)

511
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,960
This is unbelievable.

512
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,930
We didn't have a chance to travel like this.

513
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,200
- Right? - It's great.

514
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,130
- Once we get to Pattaya, - We're heading to Pattaya.

515
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,310
we have a mission.

516
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,600
- It's a drawing competition. - "Drawing Competition".

517
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,240
Jong Kook, there's a problem.

518
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,510
- What is it? - We should...

519
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,010
contact a Thai celebrity beforehand.

520
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,040
We should.

521
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,310
How about the one I mentioned?

522
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,955
- Namcha? - Yes.

523
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:00,990
(While selecting their missions as soon as they arrived,)

524
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,365
(Shorry said that he knew a Thai celebrity named Namcha.)

525
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:08,900
(Who is Namcha?)

526
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,000
(She is talented in singing, dancing, and acting.)

527
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,770
(She's a Thai multi-talented entertainer.)

528
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,615
(Does Shorry know such a popular Thai celebrity?)

529
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:21,285
- You should contact her. - Okay.

530
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:23,170
Send a message.

531
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,325
Why are you starting your social network site instead?

532
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,910
- I'll send a message from it. - I see.

533
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,625
Don't you know her number?

534
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,650
We're only acquaintances online.

535
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,750
He's her follower.

536
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,490
How are you different from her fans?

537
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,320
The difference is that she's also my follower.

538
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,830
- I see. - So I can send her messages.

539
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,890
- Thanks to YG Entertainment, - Right.

540
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,175
- Byung Jae knows... - It's a member of BLACKPINK.

541
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:46,860
- Lisa? - Yes, Lisa.

542
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,600
I'll send her a text to see what she's up to.

543
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,730
Do that.

544
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,320
She could be back in Thailand.

545
00:22:51,325 --> 00:22:52,870
I'll contact Nichkhun.

546
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,220
- Nichkhun is a good choice. - Will you call him directly?

547
00:22:55,225 --> 00:22:56,915
Is Seok Cheon around?

548
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,710
He only runs a Thai restaurant.

549
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,225
I see.

550
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,850
What do you think about that, Byung Jae?

551
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,680
Let's forgive him once.

552
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,820
If he does it again...

553
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,565
- I got a response. - Who is it?

554
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:08,290
- It's from Namcha. - He's your prey.

555
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,990
I wrote, "I'm Shorry. I'm in Thailand. Are you busy?"

556
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,990
She wrote, "Hello." What does "kinda" mean?

557
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,320
It means "a little bit".

558
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,035
She's kind of busy.

559
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:18,500
When you asked her, she said that she's a bit busy.

560
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,900
- Really? - Is she busy?

561
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,100
She's quite famous in Thailand, so she must be busy.

562
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,215
(Will they succeed in meeting a Thai celebrity?)

563
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,155
- Se Chan. - Yes?

564
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,680
Do you want to hear something creepy?

565
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,740
Yes.

566
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,095
At the airport,

567
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,325
I sent a text message to Na Eun.

568
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:45,090
(Jong Kook sent a message to Na Eun about traveling with them.)

569
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,175
(That'd be amazing if she traveled with us.)

570
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:51,545
She hadn't called me back, so...

571
00:23:52,415 --> 00:23:54,105
I wasn't thinking about it.

572
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:55,600
Apparently, she's in Thailand.

573
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,470
(Na Eun is in Thailand.)

574
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,900
(Is Son Na Eun in Thailand?)

575
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,370
- Really? In Thailand? - Yes.

576
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,240
Don't lie. Stop trying to tease me.

577
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,855
Na Eun is really in Thailand.

578
00:24:07,935 --> 00:24:09,690
- Stop lying. - It's true.

579
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,750
- Was she invited? - She's traveling with her family.

580
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750
- On a family trip? - With her family?

581
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,930
She didn't know that we were coming, right?

582
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:16,465
Of course.

583
00:24:17,475 --> 00:24:21,835
(Na Eun was Se Chan's partner.)

584
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:26,145
(Is she in Thailand as well?)

585
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,600
Wait, Jong Kook.

586
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,775
(How is this possible?)

587
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,200
They wouldn't bring me here for a prank, right?

588
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,470
- I'm not that important. - No.

589
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,955
- You're not that important. - Right?

590
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,040
- It's a coincidence. - Right.

591
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,850
- I knew it. - You aren't that important.

592
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,410
Does that mean that it's fate?

593
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,420
(Is this fate?)

594
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,350
- Do you like her? - I'm her fan, and we were partners.

595
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,120
- Were you? - We were partners twice.

596
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,390
- Really? - Yes.

597
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,190
You can have hopes for romance.

598
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,290
- Meeting that person... - That's right.

599
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,660
somewhere abroad.

600
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,000
- It's good to see them in Korea. - Right.

601
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,430
I got a hold of Na Eun.

602
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,670
- Really? - Yes.

603
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,070
- Can we say hello? - Of course.

604
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,315
- Hello? - Na Eun.

605
00:25:08,895 --> 00:25:10,770
- Hello. - Na Eun.

606
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,240
- Is it really Na Eun? - What's going on?

607
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,610
I'm on a family trip in Thailand.

608
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,680
Right. I'm sorry...

609
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,180
for bothering you while you're on a family trip.

610
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,290
(Se Chan listens carefully.)

611
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,920
- It's okay. - Is it?

612
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:29,375
I'm with Se Chan right now.

613
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,460
Oh, really?

614
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,560
(She speaks more slowly.)

615
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,770
(Oh, really?)

616
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,915
Gosh. Hello, Na Eun. This is Se Chan.

617
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,270
- Hello. - It's been a long time.

618
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,780
Na Eun, Se Chan thinks that...

619
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:49,395
it's fate that you're both in Thailand.

620
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,720
- Fate? - Yes.

621
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:55,435
(Isn't it our fate that we're both in Thailand?)

622
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:59,405
Is that so?

623
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,190
(Isn't it?)

624
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,190
- Na Eun. - Yes?

625
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:07,580
We're going to a night market in Bangkok later.

626
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:10,515
- Really? - Would you be free?

627
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:15,715
(Will you go to the night market with me?)

628
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:17,610
I like night markets.

629
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,040
(She accepts the invitation.)

630
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,980
(They're excited.)

631
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,580
(The boys get lucky.)

632
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,480
- Yes. - Na Eun.

633
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,150
- See you later, Na Eun. - Bye.

634
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,920
- See you later. - See you.

635
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,835
- Hello, I'm Shorry of Mighty Mouth. - Don't say that.

636
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:35,690
(What's wrong with you?)

637
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,690
See you later.

638
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,100
- Bye. - Bye.

639
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,445
Bye.

640
00:26:41,215 --> 00:26:43,675
You're amazing. You do everything for us.

641
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:45,570
You're the best.

642
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,045
It's a twist of fate.

643
00:26:48,055 --> 00:26:50,655
- We work well as a team. - Thank you.

644
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:52,980
By the way...

645
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,850
(A loud sound)

646
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,380
He keeps farting.

647
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,195
No, I didn't.

648
00:26:58,465 --> 00:26:59,980
(A loud sound)

649
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,950
(Jong Kook, please scold him.)

650
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,050
(He denies it.)

651
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,000
- Hey, you. - Why do you keep farting?

652
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:06,290
I didn't fart.

653
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,560
- Stop farting. - I didn't. He's lying.

654
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,230
The camera recorded the sound.

655
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,875
I'm not insane. Why would I fart in front of so many cameras?

656
00:27:14,915 --> 00:27:17,000
(Is Byung Jae insane?)

657
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,945
(Where did the sound come from?)

658
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:21,640
(Another sound)

659
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,015
He farted.

660
00:27:23,495 --> 00:27:26,710
(What's wrong? I didn't fart.)

661
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,055
(It's the first occurrence.)

662
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:31,250
(Another thud)

663
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,595
(Soon enough, there's the second thud.)

664
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,895
(Here's the ultimate one.)

665
00:27:39,475 --> 00:27:40,805
(He lifts himself up.)

666
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:45,760
(It's the third time when the sound and movement are suspicious.)

667
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,500
(Why do you keep lying?)

668
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,770
You punk.

669
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,800
He keeps farting in this position.

670
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,510
He keeps farting without stopping.

671
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,615
Are you comfortable with Jong Kook now?

672
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,580
Even I don't fart in front of him.

673
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,010
- I didn't fart. - Does he keep farting?

674
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,710
While he pretends...

675
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,110
to listen to you, he farts off of his seat.

676
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,380
That makes no sense.

677
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,550
This show is for people over 12, and my family is watching.

678
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,850
That's absurd.

679
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,320
You farted.

680
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,260
- Good thing that it didn't smell. - There's an elephant.

681
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,330
- Where? - Where?

682
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,860
- Where's an elephant? - Oh, my.

683
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,430
Over there. To the left.

684
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,745
- To the left. - It's walking.

685
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:23,010
What's that? It's so huge.

686
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,330
I've never seen an elephant before.

687
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,940
Is this a zoo?

688
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,540
- We're here. - We're here.

689
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,040
- Let's go. - Here we are.

690
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,785
(Asia's largest tropical park)

691
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:38,525
(This 6,600,000m² park is full of things to see and do.)

692
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:42,450
I see something.

693
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:44,730
Jong Kook, look at those birds.

694
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:46,400
- Birds. - They're alive.

695
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,960
There are birds. We have to pay to take pictures.

696
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,575
- We have to pay. - Really?

697
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,500
- There's a tiger. - Can we take a picture with it?

698
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,960
- It's a tiger. - It's a real tiger.

699
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,040
It's real.

700
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,345
Be quiet.

701
00:28:57,115 --> 00:29:00,410
- Unbelievable. It's a tiger. - It's a tiger.

702
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,455
- I can't believe it. - It's so close.

703
00:29:04,695 --> 00:29:06,690
Is it a pet?

704
00:29:06,695 --> 00:29:09,595
If you annoy him, he might bite you.

705
00:29:09,865 --> 00:29:12,820
It's staring at us. Look away.

706
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,490
Shouldn't we take a picture with it?

707
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,950
Jong Kook. Can you take a picture with the tiger?

708
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,920
- You're the tiger. - You're the tiger.

709
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,620
- Should I take one? - Do it.

710
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,935
Excuse me. Here's the Korean tiger.

711
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:27,545
One person, please.

712
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:31,115
This is crazy.

713
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:33,045
(Scared)

714
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:37,185
(Jong Kook sits next to the tiger.)

715
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:38,585
My goodness.

716
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,255
Jong Kook.

717
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:44,455
(What is he doing?)

718
00:29:45,205 --> 00:29:46,895
Say cheese.

719
00:29:48,065 --> 00:29:52,030
(He meets his relative.)

720
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,235
Okay.

721
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:56,635
(Nice to meet you, friend.)

722
00:29:58,015 --> 00:30:00,460
(Byung Jae is frightened.)

723
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,970
It felt weird.

724
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,500
(Is Byung Jae going to do it?)

725
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,770
(Getting up)

726
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,300
- It's getting up. - It's getting up.

727
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,140
- It's getting up. - Byung Jae.

728
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,440
(As Byung Jae approaches, the tiger gets up.)

729
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,250
(Frozen)

730
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,995
Could it be the color of your sweater?

731
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:21,065
(Why did I say I'd do this?)

732
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,965
(Yawning)

733
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:29,075
(Come take a picture with me.)

734
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:31,735
(Our eyes met.)

735
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:33,975
How is this possible?

736
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:38,270
(The tiger looks more frightening than ever.)

737
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,980
(Byung Jae sits next to it, scared.)

738
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,140
Smile.

739
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,740
(Smile)

740
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,630
- It'll be a nice memory. - Right.

741
00:30:48,635 --> 00:30:51,425
(Roar)

742
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:56,100
(Let's be friends.)

743
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,495
Amazing.

744
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,635
It was amazing. Good job.

745
00:31:00,045 --> 00:31:01,860
- Should we get some t-shirts? - Let's get some new clothes.

746
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,605
Let's go inside.

747
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:06,960
(It's cool inside the shopping mall.)

748
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,010
There are many clothes.

749
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,875
There are. Flower-printed shirts.

750
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:14,085
What do you say to flower-printed shirts?

751
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,070
- What about this? - We could all wear one of these.

752
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,440
- This one. - Hey.

753
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,320
- All four of us. - It'll be nice and cool.

754
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Friends are supposed to do that.

755
00:31:21,325 --> 00:31:22,450
Let's vote.

756
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,450
- Me. Let's wear these shorts. - Let's all wear them.

757
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,120
- Let's all wear them. - These?

758
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,790
- Yes. - We're friends.

759
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,965
(They change into their uniforms.)

760
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,360
(Colorful)

761
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,605
There's an elephant.

762
00:31:33,645 --> 00:31:34,830
Where?

763
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,730
- Isn't that a sculpture? - No. It's moving.

764
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,860
It's real.

765
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,205
(Artist elephants)

766
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:43,645
(Sunday, male, painter)

767
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:45,945
Hi.

768
00:31:46,025 --> 00:31:47,845
How sweet.

769
00:31:48,995 --> 00:31:51,840
(Nice to meet you, Sunday.)

770
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,480
- Oh, my. - It feels nice.

771
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,725
- Hi. - He's only three years old?

772
00:31:57,235 --> 00:31:59,250
(Waving)

773
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,265
(Nice to meet you guys.)

774
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:03,950
- Here. - Oh, my.

775
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,460
(He's stealing the guys' hearts.)

776
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,905
- He's very sweet. - He's so cute.

777
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,730
What are you doing?

778
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,075
(Standing on two feet)

779
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:15,315
(Let me show you my skills.)

780
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:17,830
(In love)

781
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,270
He is showing off his skills.

782
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,570
- Right. - I know.

783
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,940
- Good job, Sunday. - Thanks, Sunday.

784
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,880
Here's the mission.

785
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,325
All of you will make a painting...

786
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:31,080
- on the same subject as Sunday, - All of us?

787
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,295
and the park visitors will take a vote.

788
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:37,590
The subject is Sunday's favorite, landscape.

789
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,290
- Landscape? Okay. - Are we painting a landscape?

790
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,330
I don't think we'll lose to an elephant.

791
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,105
How well could an elephant paint?

792
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:46,675
I'm not sure I'll paint better than the elephant.

793
00:32:46,745 --> 00:32:48,230
We have to win.

794
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,875
- Sunday. - We'll beat you.

795
00:32:51,755 --> 00:32:53,010
It's a competition.

796
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,385
Ready.

797
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:56,540
What if he paints very fast?

798
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,025
Get ready, and...

799
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:02,055
start.

800
00:33:02,795 --> 00:33:04,955
- Seriously? - What if he is too fast?

801
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:08,735
(Let me see.)

802
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:15,065
(Team Between Friends start painting right away.)

803
00:33:17,115 --> 00:33:19,705
(They look very serious.)

804
00:33:21,145 --> 00:33:25,245
(This game is supposed to be fun, but it's getting too tense.)

805
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:29,685
(How well could an elephant paint?)

806
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:34,155
(Painting)

807
00:33:35,365 --> 00:33:38,010
(Sunday holds the brush with his trunk.)

808
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,965
(Sketching)

809
00:33:43,175 --> 00:33:46,105
(The audience is fascinated.)

810
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,930
(Meanwhile,)

811
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,160
(the human contestants...)

812
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,975
(Quick strokes)

813
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:59,070
(He is smudging the canvas with green paint.)

814
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,345
(Byung Jae is an impressionist.)

815
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,240
You're doing very well.

816
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,710
(Shorry actually majored in arts.)

817
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,840
(His painting looks nice,)

818
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,525
(but his movement looks frivolous.)

819
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:14,120
(With his lips tight,)

820
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,295
(Jong Kooks is making a detailed painting.)

821
00:34:18,775 --> 00:34:20,065
What are you painting?

822
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,910
What is that?

823
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:23,175
A tree.

824
00:34:23,715 --> 00:34:25,005
I just need some brown.

825
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:27,345
Use purple if you don't have brown.

826
00:34:28,855 --> 00:34:31,770
(The human contestants use brush strokes.)

827
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,285
(Tapping)

828
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,985
(The elephant relaxedly taps the canvas with his trunk.)

829
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:41,540
(He reminds you...)

830
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,480
(of the man who used to paint so effortlessly.)

831
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,895
(Bob Ross)

832
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:52,040
(A landscape painting is a piece of cake.)

833
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:54,035
The elephant is speeding up.

834
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:56,860
- He's so fast. - My goodness.

835
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,090
(How can he be so fast?)

836
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,275
I messed up.

837
00:34:59,615 --> 00:35:02,230
(Sunday is finishing up.)

838
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,615
I need some red.

839
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,640
- Red. - I need brown.

840
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,440
We don't have any. Use purple instead.

841
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,585
I messed up.

842
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:12,040
(Sunday is finished.)

843
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,585
(Time is up.)

844
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:16,080
Stop.

845
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,325
(The competition is over.)

846
00:35:17,735 --> 00:35:19,380
Already?

847
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,980
- It's already over? - My goodness.

848
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,365
Jong Kook and Shorry did a good job.

849
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,820
Good job, Shorry.

850
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,865
(Shorry's painting has a sense of dimension.)

851
00:35:28,775 --> 00:35:31,660
- No. - It looks very nice.

852
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,760
Mine looks weird.

853
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,960
- But Byung Jae... - Your canvas is...

854
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,970
full at least. It'll stand out.

855
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,840
(What is this?)

856
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,210
Isn't that a planarian?

857
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,540
Why did I paint a mushroom?

858
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,940
- Se Chan's shouldn't be chosen. - Then we'll be doomed.

859
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,155
Gosh.

860
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:48,625
Mine is bad too.

861
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:49,850
Gosh, I'm tired.

862
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,855
(How does Sunday's painting look?)

863
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,465
(What is this?)

864
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:59,405
(Ta-da)

865
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:03,460
I don't believe it.

866
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,860
It must have been painted by a human being.

867
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,600
- Sir, you painted it, right? - Sunday painted it?

868
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,175
(They can't believe what they see.)

869
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:09,670
Seriously?

870
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,270
- Unbelievable. - Look at the colors.

871
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,310
- He mixed red with yellow. - The combination of colors...

872
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,240
Look at the combination of colors.

873
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,940
How is this possible?

874
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:19,155
- It's a piece of art. - How can he do this?

875
00:36:19,695 --> 00:36:21,210
(What are those scribbles?)

876
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,695
Why do ours look so bad?

877
00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:26,280
Why did you paint fruits on the tree?

878
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,820
- The painting looked too empty. - I painted fruits.

879
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,920
It didn't look like a tree, so I painted fruits.

880
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,560
Sunday will choose one painting of yours...

881
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,460
that will compete against his.

882
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,605
He must have a good eye.

883
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:42,110
I'm getting nervous.

884
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,230
I hope he won't choose mine.

885
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,540
Please don't choose Se Chan's. We have to win.

886
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,845
- Don't come here. - We have to win.

887
00:36:48,325 --> 00:36:49,585
I'm nervous.

888
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:51,740
Yes, choose that one.

889
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,340
(Whose painting will Sunday choose?)

890
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,450
Not this?

891
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,595
I'm nervous.

892
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:58,760
Yes, choose that one.

893
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,850
(Jong Kook's?)

894
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,795
- Choose that one. - Not this?

895
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,370
Amazing.

896
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:05,860
He came... No.

897
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,060
- No! - Don't!

898
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,090
(Se Chan's mushroom)

899
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,860
No!

900
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,360
(No!)

901
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,505
Don't!

902
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,330
Please go away.

903
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,170
No!

904
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,585
(Turning away)

905
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,340
- This is exciting. - He's making us nervous.

906
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,785
He understands variety shows.

907
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:28,225
We're wearing the same color. Pick mine.

908
00:37:29,635 --> 00:37:31,250
(Everyone is watching Sunday's trunk.)

909
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,230
Come here. Hi.

910
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:34,450
Come on.

911
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,320
He's coming closer to Shorry.

912
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,650
Come on!

913
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,120
- Yes! - Yes!

914
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,960
He picked Shorry's!

915
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,390
Yes!

916
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,260
- I'm so relieved. - He has a good eye.

917
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,830
Good job.

918
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,200
- Thanks. - Good job. Thanks.

919
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,900
Shorry's painting will compete against Sunday's.

920
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,900
Okay.

921
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,455
(They even signed their paintings.)

922
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:01,525
(The vote starts.)

923
00:38:05,835 --> 00:38:11,550
(The visitors will vote for the painting for 30 minutes.)

924
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,665
(We'd like to thank everyone who participated in the voting.)

925
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,575
(What is the result?)

926
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:20,570
It's Sunday, the elephant versus Shorry.

927
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,075
I will announce the result of the voting.

928
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:28,145
(Which one of them will be the final victor of the match?)

929
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:32,010
- What is this? - How do we know which one won?

930
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,655
- My gosh, the hearts... - We lost.

931
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,790
- We lost? - Yes, we did. Hold on.

932
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,155
We lost by a landslide.

933
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:41,060
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. - We lost. We really did.

934
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:42,830
- We lost, Shorry. - 7, 8, 9, 10.

935
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,895
- There's no point counting. - We lost to an elephant?

936
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,765
I get it, you know. The brushstrokes are too good.

937
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:50,460
- It looks like a person painted it. - I love the composition here.

938
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,800
(No one would've guessed an elephant drew this painting.)

939
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,870
- Then what happens to us? - Since you failed the mission,

940
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,115
we'll add 1,000 steps to your counters.

941
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:00,545
Tell us how you want to divide the steps among yourselves.

942
00:39:00,685 --> 00:39:03,550
Shorry, why did you draw the S like this?

943
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:04,810
I...

944
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,180
You're right. The brushstroke wasn't that good.

945
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,610
- As it so happens, - Right.

946
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,695
- his painting lost out to Sunday's. - Right.

947
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,960
- I think... - I...

948
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,320
I will... I will take...

949
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,690
I will gladly receive those 1,000 steps.

950
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,690
Is that your idea?

951
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,935
- Sure. It's completely my idea. - Is that so?

952
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,835
I will take those steps.

953
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,835
- Should we laugh all together? - It's because...

954
00:39:24,245 --> 00:39:27,705
(Yes, let's smile. I'm lucky that I didn't get 1,000 punches.)

955
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,830
(Meanwhile, Team Love Triangle in Daema Island...)

956
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,170
- Where are we? - Enjoy your meal.

957
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,445
- We can just eat? - My gosh.

958
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:34,540
I guess he just sliced it.

959
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,810
(They can eat as much as they want.)

960
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,840
- This is so good. - Sir, this tastes divine.

961
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,910
Now, we'll inform your mission in Daema Island.

962
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,090
Your mission is accomplished when you catch the fish you ate.

963
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,080
Per type of fish you fail to catch,

964
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,850
you will earn 1,000 steps.

965
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,850
My gosh, this is too cruel.

966
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,795
- 7? He has to catch 7? - I only ate 2 types of fish.

967
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,530
- What are the other two? - I'm in trouble.

968
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,765
I ate them all.

969
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,990
- Haha. - Seriously.

970
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,760
If we don't pick Ji Hyo, it's impossible to complete our mission.

971
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,345
If we get Haha, it'd be a catastrophe.

972
00:39:59,915 --> 00:40:02,160
- We just have to pick my name. - Yes, we must pick her name.

973
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,500
Bring in the globe now.

974
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,470
- It's because... Look, Haha. - It's either Ji Hyo's or my name.

975
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,800
- We'd be okay with that. - My gosh, you are too harsh.

976
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,110
Picking Ji Hyo's name would be best.

977
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,785
If we get your name and can't catch any, it's 8,000 steps.

978
00:40:11,895 --> 00:40:13,425
For you, it'd be 7,000 steps.

979
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:16,455
- That's right. It's 7,000. - It's extra 7,000 or 8,000 steps.

980
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:19,225
When you're ready, say, "Start."

981
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:22,090
We'll practice.

982
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,790
(He taps it rather late.)

983
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,035
(He taps it after the globe comes to a stop.)

984
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:29,935
Wasn't that acceptable?

985
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:32,760
- Isn't that allowed? - This isn't acceptable?

986
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,230
You're too picky.

987
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,040
Remember "apartment in Busan"?

988
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,170
Remember that time? I should give this another try.

989
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,740
- Yes. Apartment in Busan. - Exactly.

990
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,985
Let me practice.

991
00:40:41,885 --> 00:40:45,110
(Haha)

992
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,380
(He picks Haha again.)

993
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,440
You don't need to spin it hard.

994
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,640
(He picks Haha again.)

995
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,125
I keep choosing Haha. What is happening?

996
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:52,765
My gosh.

997
00:40:53,735 --> 00:40:55,020
(He picks Haha 5 times and Kwang Soo 1 time.)

998
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,250
- Don't do it. - You shouldn't do that.

999
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,520
Ji Hyo, you should do it. You should pick your name too.

1000
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,735
(No one in our team can do this right.)

1001
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:01,790
(Ji Hyo picks her name.)

1002
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:02,935
That's right!

1003
00:41:03,075 --> 00:41:05,775
- She picked her name. - Ji Hyo is unbelievable.

1004
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:06,960
(She's our only hope.)

1005
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,100
Let's do this. Let's go.

1006
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,670
- Don't blame me. - Okay.

1007
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,240
- Don't blame me. - Let's do this.

1008
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,140
- Let's go. - Don't pick me or Kwang Soo.

1009
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,140
She might feel pressured, so even if she picks our names,

1010
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,340
- I understand. - let's just laugh.

1011
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,610
- Okay. - Laugh like you're happy.

1012
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,010
I can smile really happily.

1013
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,490
- Ji Hyo will try it. - Okay.

1014
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,355
- Start. - Start.

1015
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:27,620
(Feeling nervous)

1016
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,735
- This is nerve-wracking. - It's all right.

1017
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,190
(If she chooses Haha or Kwang Soo, it's the worst scenario.)

1018
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,835
(She must choose herself or Sang Yeob to be successful.)

1019
00:41:35,445 --> 00:41:38,160
It's Sang Yeob!

1020
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,400
That's all right. It's five.

1021
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,130
- This is good. - This isn't bad.

1022
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,600
- We were so close though. - Let me tell you the names.

1023
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,070
They are filefish, smallscale blackfish, yellowtail amberjack,

1024
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,915
striped beakfish, and squid.

1025
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:51,540
(Now that they think of their mission,)

1026
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,425
(catching five different types of fish is quite a lot.)

1027
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:58,425
Hold on. Did you say, "Start"?

1028
00:41:58,695 --> 00:42:00,180
- She... - She did say so.

1029
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,450
- When? - Don't we all have to say that?

1030
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,790
- We all have to say that. - We didn't say it together.

1031
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,550
- That's the rule. - I almost forgot. Right.

1032
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,760
- Why didn't you say it with us? - Let's do this again.

1033
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,660
- We must count before we start. - Right.

1034
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,960
Let's count before we say, "Start."

1035
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,430
- 1, 2, 3. Just like this? - Okay. Start.

1036
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,200
- 1, 2, 3. Start. - 1, 2, 3. Start.

1037
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,370
(The staff will give them another chance.)

1038
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:21,285
(Please let it be my name this time.)

1039
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:25,210
(They turned down Sang Yeob which is their second best shot.)

1040
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,785
(These four members are only aiming for Ji Hyo's name.)

1041
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:33,880
(It's the worst pick. She chooses Haha with 8 species.)

1042
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,500
- Haha. - No, no.

1043
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:38,450
- Haha. Let me read yours. - No, Sang Yeob...

1044
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,860
- We'll go with Sang Yeob. - You had filefish,

1045
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,220
- I'm sorry. - yellowtail amberjack,

1046
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,030
chicken grunt, conger eel, conger eel,

1047
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,330
- Okay. It's 1 to 1 now. - and squid.

1048
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,705
- It's 1 to 1. - 1 to 1.

1049
00:42:46,715 --> 00:42:48,160
- 1 to 1. - Don't you agree?

1050
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,470
- But still... - Sang Yeob, you should decide.

1051
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,370
- In this situation... - We ought to play three times.

1052
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:53,500
Tell us if the score is 1 to 1 or not. Just answer me that.

1053
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,570
- Of course, it is. - It's 1 to 1.

1054
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,270
Because I didn't say, "Start."

1055
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,470
- Then... - We'll accept the result this time.

1056
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,480
We'll accept the name we pick this time.

1057
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,650
- I'm telling you the truth. - Then...

1058
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,430
Why doesn't everyone including the staff say it?

1059
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:06,020
- Say, "Start" when we count. - Okay, let's do it all together...

1060
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,395
because we are a family.

1061
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:10,195
I mean if we ask...

1062
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,150
the chef to do it, it'd be funny.

1063
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,990
- Should we ask him? - Yes, let's do that.

1064
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,230
(To be fair, they will ask the Japanese chef to choose.)

1065
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,290
My gosh, Haha is a genius.

1066
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,375
He's a genius. Seriously.

1067
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:24,300
- His fingers are sensitive too. - That's right.

1068
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,170
(The Japanese chef, sushi master, will pick the name.)

1069
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,270
If he picks my name, we're good.

1070
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,085
(Please pick Ji Hyo's name.)

1071
00:43:30,195 --> 00:43:32,410
(He feels nervous for some reason.)

1072
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,550
After counting to three, say, "Start."

1073
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:36,880
- 1, 2, 3. Start. - Start.

1074
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,150
- Start. - Start.

1075
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,680
- Okay. - We'll accept it this time.

1076
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,750
- We mean it. - We're serious.

1077
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,380
- Seriously. - We'll accept it.

1078
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,465
- The chef will say, "Start." - Okay.

1079
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,865
- 1, 2, 3. Start. - 1, 2, 3. Start.

1080
00:43:49,915 --> 00:43:53,460
(Per species they fail to acquire, they'll add 1,000 steps.)

1081
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,645
(He must pick Ji Hyo's name for the sake of the counter.)

1082
00:44:00,355 --> 00:44:01,640
It's Haha.

1083
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,950
(Haha with 8 species to catch is chosen.)

1084
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:06,710
Filefish, yellowtail amberjack, red seabream, smallscale blackfish,

1085
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,210
chicken grunt, conger eel, striped beakfish, and squid.

1086
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,150
Thank you. Thank you.

1087
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,830
(We are doomed.)

1088
00:44:13,835 --> 00:44:17,195
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1089
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:21,335
(It's hard to even memorize those 8 species.)

1090
00:44:21,345 --> 00:44:24,130
Hold on. Can we have a meeting? Just give us 20 seconds.

1091
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,535
Is there a way we can get out of this?

1092
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:27,400
I can't do this.

1093
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,050
Why did you have to eat a lot?

1094
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:32,000
We should've stopped when we had Sang Yeob's name.

1095
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,715
Why did you have to risk it?

1096
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:36,170
- What's wrong with you today? - We could've worked together.

1097
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,715
Why did you do that?

1098
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:40,310
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1099
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,080
(It's time to return to their hotel while feeling bitter.)

1100
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,625
(It feels like such a long day today.)

1101
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:48,750
(Trudging)

1102
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,590
- Thank you. - That's dangerous.

1103
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,690
- Thank you. - No problem.

1104
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:52,720
- My gosh. - Thank you.

1105
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,260
- This is the place. - Let's take this.

1106
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,590
This must be it.

1107
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:58,210
- This must be the reception. - The ambience looks nice.

1108
00:44:58,215 --> 00:44:59,745
How pretty.

1109
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:02,130
- Excuse us. - Excuse us.

1110
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:04,300
- Hello. - Hello.

1111
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,815
You speak Korean.

1112
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:08,400
- Come in, please. - Okay.

1113
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,610
(How will their lodging look?)

1114
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,185
- I'll go in for now, but... - This looks nice.

1115
00:45:14,525 --> 00:45:19,950
(It's a cute, cozy, and traditional bed and breakfast in Japan.)

1116
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,120
This looks nice.

1117
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:25,495
(It's the best place for them to reflect on their rough day.)

1118
00:45:26,575 --> 00:45:28,005
This is lovely.

1119
00:45:28,105 --> 00:45:29,875
It's been here for 100 years?

1120
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:33,605
It's been here for 160 years.

1121
00:45:33,885 --> 00:45:35,345
- My gosh. - Really?

1122
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:37,575
Then this must be a family business.

1123
00:45:38,355 --> 00:45:42,145
(When you climb the stairs with marks of a 160-year-history,)

1124
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:47,225
(there's a room where the members will stay for the night.)

1125
00:45:51,795 --> 00:45:54,895
- It's warm. It's warm. - It is so warm in here.

1126
00:45:55,065 --> 00:45:56,895
(Impressed)

1127
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:00,320
(Today must have been the toughest for Sang Yeob.)

1128
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,730
Hold on.

1129
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,230
- Let's change. - Wait.

1130
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,270
- I need my bag. - Seriously.

1131
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,830
- Sang Yeob, let's get some sleep. - Yes?

1132
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,705
Don't do anything fishy during the night.

1133
00:46:09,555 --> 00:46:10,910
- Right. - I won't.

1134
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,215
(He takes Haha's step counter.)

1135
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,150
(Rattling)

1136
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:19,725
- The blankets... - Hey, hey. Bring it back.

1137
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:21,125
Bring it back.

1138
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,280
Unbelievable. What's the matter with you?

1139
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,095
- Hear me out. - Bring it.

1140
00:46:25,195 --> 00:46:26,950
- Give it back. I can't believe you. - That's not what I meant.

1141
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,150
- Hey, about what you did... - Did you just slap me?

1142
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,150
- It infuriates me. - I was just messing with you.

1143
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:32,390
I was testing if you trusted me or not.

1144
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,705
Kwang Soo, you have a problem!

1145
00:46:35,345 --> 00:46:37,190
(Thus began the 7th war of the step counter.)

1146
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:38,535
Sang Yeob, hold Haha!

1147
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:40,870
- I'm going to up his number. - Hey!

1148
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,960
(Even Sang Yeob joins.)

1149
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,970
- I'll hold him. - Hey, Ji Hyo.

1150
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,270
I love you!

1151
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,540
(He has lost it.)

1152
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,200
(This childish war continued for 30 minutes.)

1153
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,810
I got it. Okay, I got it.

1154
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,385
- Where did he hide it? - Hey.

1155
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:52,925
Let's not attack each other.

1156
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,025
So what's our plan?

1157
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:58,480
- Let's make a deal and sleep. - Let's just sleep.

1158
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,820
They were very crafty when they were making this game.

1159
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,050
2nd and 3rd places aren't important.

1160
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,290
We must take the first place.

1161
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,035
Ji Hyo is in first.

1162
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:08,690
(What? Look at that.)

1163
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,105
What is it?

1164
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:13,430
(1st place is the only way to survive. Let me take your spot!)

1165
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,305
(Ji Hyo bumps her head.)

1166
00:47:16,215 --> 00:47:17,630
What are you doing?

1167
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:19,070
(He's dejected.)

1168
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,200
Are we even a team?

1169
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,920
(Are we even a team?)

1170
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:24,155
Is this what family is about?

1171
00:47:24,855 --> 00:47:26,780
- My head. - Is this what traveling is about?

1172
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,210
Kwang Soo, come on. What's your deal with me?

1173
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,580
- What's going on here? - We are a team.

1174
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,165
Kwang Soo, what is it that you want?

1175
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:36,450
- Look at his eyes. - Be honest with us.

1176
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,035
1st place. To be exempted.

1177
00:47:38,075 --> 00:47:39,495
I don't want to face the penalty.

1178
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:42,690
Is that so? Will you be happy if you get those?

1179
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,505
I don't care which one of you ends up last...

1180
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,030
as long as it's not me.

1181
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,875
Will you be happy if we make that happen for you?

1182
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:49,715
- Is that it? - Yes.

1183
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,210
- But... - What about you?

1184
00:47:51,215 --> 00:47:53,315
- First place. - What about you?

1185
00:47:53,585 --> 00:47:55,145
I don't want to be last.

1186
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:57,215
- What's yours, Haha? - What about you, Haha?

1187
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:00,255
Whatever it was, it wasn't this.

1188
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:03,850
(Whom is he trying to fool?)

1189
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,055
Then what is it?

1190
00:48:05,965 --> 00:48:07,450
How is this a family?

1191
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:09,660
How is this a team?

1192
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,890
I won't when we sleep.

1193
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,350
- You won't? - This is the end.

1194
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:13,790
Let me be honest.

1195
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,190
Including what you did to me and teased me about,

1196
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,630
I'll forgive everything.

1197
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,730
Stop kidding around.

1198
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,400
- We're the ones who should forgive. - It should be us.

1199
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,745
I decided to forgive you.

1200
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,870
Can you rewind the camera recording?

1201
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,580
The show is over for me after today's shoot.

1202
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,280
What about you two?

1203
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,725
What will you do, Kwang Soo?

1204
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,010
Will you keep living like this?

1205
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,250
- Sang Yeob. - Yes?

1206
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,925
Why would you leave after this shoot?

1207
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:41,965
I'll change my phone number.

1208
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:43,620
I'll change it.

1209
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,490
I'll even change the service provider.

1210
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,790
I ask you not to shoot dramas for a while.

1211
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,935
(Haha asks him a favor.)

1212
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:53,500
Let's promise each other.

1213
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Even if we start tomorrow,

1214
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,600
let's not bother each other during sleep.

1215
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,630
- Right. - From now on to tomorrow morning.

1216
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,180
Until we leave tomorrow.

1217
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,645
This is really the last time.

1218
00:49:03,295 --> 00:49:04,770
The winner of rock-paper-scissors...

1219
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,855
gets the loser's step counter for 10 seconds.

1220
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:08,480
I'm sorry.

1221
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,750
I feel anxious.

1222
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,920
I lost too much just a moment ago.

1223
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,090
I have to harass someone before sleeping.

1224
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,695
- Okay. - Let's play one last game.

1225
00:49:16,735 --> 00:49:18,090
It's the loser.

1226
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,505
The loser gives his step counter.

1227
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:21,890
Okay?

1228
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,360
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1229
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,435
(Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo lose.)

1230
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,175
This is great.

1231
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:29,345
I played this game because of you.

1232
00:49:29,385 --> 00:49:31,175
My target is you too.

1233
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,615
I lost so much.

1234
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:35,085
How about this?

1235
00:49:35,485 --> 00:49:37,840
You get 10 seconds each.

1236
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,590
You get another 10 seconds each.

1237
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:43,055
You can shake the step counter more.

1238
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:46,580
Wouldn't that be great with a table in between?

1239
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,990
You're a piece of trash.

1240
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,080
Isn't it a good idea?

1241
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,260
- It means that we both lose. - That's right.

1242
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,360
It'd be great. Think about it.

1243
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,560
- It sounds thrilling. - You shake someone else's counter.

1244
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,135
Each of you shake the other's step counter.

1245
00:49:59,215 --> 00:50:01,060
(He seems convinced.)

1246
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,275
Swap the step counters.

1247
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,200
Swap them.

1248
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,715
- Wait, you swap them for us. - I'll give it to you.

1249
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:10,720
Fine, I won't do it.

1250
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:13,110
(He shakes them immediately.)

1251
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:14,640
- What? - I'll stop.

1252
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,880
- Come on, Haha. - I was trying to be funny.

1253
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,010
(I've never seen anyone like them.)

1254
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,080
I swapped them.

1255
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,620
Don't start. Put it down.

1256
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,165
Put it down for now.

1257
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:25,560
Should we do this?

1258
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,790
I don't know.

1259
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,205
(Why are we doing this?)

1260
00:50:28,475 --> 00:50:29,660
Get ready.

1261
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,160
Listen to him.

1262
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,675
- Wait until it's 2:30am. - I think Haha is being too...

1263
00:50:35,545 --> 00:50:36,815
Start.

1264
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:40,380
(Does Sang Yeob attack first?)

1265
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,470
(My goodness)

1266
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:43,570
You didn't start together.

1267
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,215
Let's go.

1268
00:50:45,395 --> 00:50:47,510
(Give back my step counter.)

1269
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,990
My goodness. They're scary.

1270
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,590
10 seconds are up.

1271
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,080
- Time is up. - Time is up.

1272
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,780
- Stop it. - Stop.

1273
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,390
- Stop. - Stop.

1274
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,190
- Stop it. - Hey, stop it.

1275
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,320
Give it back!

1276
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,590
Both of us will lose. Put it down.

1277
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,190
- You put it down. - We'll both lose.

1278
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:03,830
- Come on. - Put it down.

1279
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,460
You're a piece of trash.

1280
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,930
Put it down.

1281
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,730
- Stop shaking it. - Let it go.

1282
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:09,800
Let it go.

1283
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,130
Stop shaking it.

1284
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:12,475
No.

1285
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:14,240
Just stop shaking it.

1286
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,470
- Stop it. - Hey.

1287
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,485
- Stop at the count of 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1288
00:51:17,555 --> 00:51:18,920
Stop.

1289
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,540
I told you to stop.

1290
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,810
Stop at the count of three.

1291
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:24,680
- 1, 2, 1, 2, 3. Throw it. - 3.

1292
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,125
Please.

1293
00:51:26,405 --> 00:51:28,560
- Please. - Oh, no.

1294
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,150
- My goodness. - Please stop.

1295
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,050
Wait, stop it.

1296
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,000
- Stop. - Stand over there.

1297
00:51:34,005 --> 00:51:35,460
- Stand over there. - Okay.

1298
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,130
This will be pointless.

1299
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,730
The game will be pointless.

1300
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,600
- Put it down. - Seriously, put it down.

1301
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,530
- I put it down. - This is hilarious.

1302
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,100
- Put it on the floor. - I laughed so much.

1303
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,630
- I laughed so much. - Let's swap.

1304
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,800
- Let's swap. - That was hilarious.

1305
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,815
Take your hand off. Lift your hand.

1306
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:51,255
- Okay. - Lift hands at the same time.

1307
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:55,740
- 1, 2. I let it go. - That was funny.

1308
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,890
1, 2, 3.

1309
00:51:57,895 --> 00:51:59,225
My hand is off.

1310
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:01,950
Three. My hand is off.

1311
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:04,630
(The step counter is in his other hand.)

1312
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,950
(It's not over yet.)

1313
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,260
That's hilarious.

1314
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,030
- I won. - You're a piece of trash.

1315
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,430
- Hey. - Please stop.

1316
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,790
Please stop.

1317
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:14,200
- Stop it. - It's over for you.

1318
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,510
I put it down. I did.

1319
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,330
- I put it down. - Okay.

1320
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,700
- Let it go. 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1321
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,915
I stopped.

1322
00:52:22,485 --> 00:52:24,380
Why should we do this?

1323
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,715
What's my count?

1324
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:29,080
It's 4,670.

1325
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,695
Yours is 5,060.

1326
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:32,695
What are you doing?

1327
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:34,280
Wait.

1328
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,925
Stop it.

1329
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:37,820
(Sang Yeob became part of the team.)

1330
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,150
How dare you?

1331
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,660
- Die! - Wait.

1332
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,660
I put yours down.

1333
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,490
I really put it down.

1334
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,700
I can't stay here anymore.

1335
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,530
- Where is it? - I let it go.

1336
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,930
- Stop shaking it. - They're hilarious.

1337
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,470
- You keep shaking it. - I let it go.

1338
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,800
- Okay. - I let it go.

1339
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,215
- Stop it. - Okay, I let it go now.

1340
00:52:57,355 --> 00:52:59,980
It was nice in the city. There were many restaurants.

1341
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,440
There were so many good restaurants, but why are we back here?

1342
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,955
It must be a tasty restaurant.

1343
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:08,320
We were so happy on International Street.

1344
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,765
- You know what the worst is? - What?

1345
00:53:10,805 --> 00:53:14,165
We go back and meet the worker at a convenience store.

1346
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,920
- Ramen again? - Again...

1347
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,590
we go straight and see ramen again.

1348
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,605
Let's order one bowl today.

1349
00:53:20,745 --> 00:53:22,430
We ordered a total of four.

1350
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,430
Let's be careful of that.

1351
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,470
We should be careful.

1352
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:27,400
- Be careful what you say. - Let's order one.

1353
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,470
Don't talk too much.

1354
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,210
- Let's eat and move to the next. - Let's go.

1355
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,815
- Let's hurry. - Shall we?

1356
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:34,085
It's crowded here.

1357
00:53:34,325 --> 00:53:35,510
Goodness.

1358
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:37,495
Look how crowded it is.

1359
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:40,280
- The pork cutlet looks good. - It's full of people.

1360
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,435
(The restaurant is packed with customers.)

1361
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:46,230
(Do we have to show it again?)

1362
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:47,460
(It's the same as yesterday.)

1363
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,035
(It's a soba restaurant that sells Okinawa soba.)

1364
00:53:50,615 --> 00:53:53,030
- Excuse me. - Goodness.

1365
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,630
You can't shoot because we're full.

1366
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,410
The tables are full.

1367
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:00,515
- They're full? - It's full.

1368
00:54:01,085 --> 00:54:03,770
- Thank you very much. - Thank you.

1369
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,240
(Thank you for not letting us in.)

1370
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,310
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1371
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:10,050
Why do you thank her when it's full?

1372
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,310
It's full.

1373
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:13,280
- Let's go. - It's such a popular place.

1374
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,750
- We can't eat here. - We can't.

1375
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,260
Rules are rules.

1376
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:20,565
Let's get a takeout and eat it at a nearby park.

1377
00:54:20,975 --> 00:54:22,830
- Listen. - It's too packed.

1378
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:24,690
- However, rules are rules. - Hey.

1379
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,800
I didn't know it was such a popular restaurant.

1380
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,500
It must be a famous, tasty restaurant.

1381
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,570
- It must be delicious. - Customers keep going in.

1382
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:32,500
They keep going in. They're lining up.

1383
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,710
- It's only us who don't like it. - Is it delicious?

1384
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,470
- It's delicious. - I see.

1385
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:37,740
He says that it's delicious.

1386
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,880
Since we don't have time, we'll order a takeout.

1387
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,355
- Get one order for takeout. - Yes.

1388
00:54:43,495 --> 00:54:45,450
Was there a railroad here in the past?

1389
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:47,595
- I think so. - You're right.

1390
00:54:48,065 --> 00:54:49,890
(So Min sits on a steep spot.)

1391
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,530
What's this?

1392
00:54:51,535 --> 00:54:53,665
Why did you sit at a bad spot?

1393
00:54:54,245 --> 00:54:56,420
- Let's just sit and eat. - There's a comfortable spot.

1394
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,290
We should sit in one row for the look.

1395
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,260
Would we look better?

1396
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,800
It looks better than yesterday.

1397
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,475
(The soba looks better than yesterday.)

1398
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:07,585
(Today's soba is only soup and noodles.)

1399
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:09,440
(Shall I smell it?)

1400
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,715
How is it?

1401
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:12,985
It's okay.

1402
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:14,520
Compared to yesterday,

1403
00:55:14,525 --> 00:55:15,985
did we order something else?

1404
00:55:16,025 --> 00:55:17,325
What's this?

1405
00:55:17,395 --> 00:55:19,680
I think we ordered something else.

1406
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,220
- No. - It's the same.

1407
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,665
It's with jokbal.

1408
00:55:22,765 --> 00:55:27,565
This is what gives that taste.

1409
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,320
- That's it. - It's the sauce.

1410
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,475
- It's soy sauce jokbal. - Can you not add the meat?

1411
00:55:31,675 --> 00:55:34,000
- I have to add it. - We must add everything given.

1412
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,145
(We have no choice.)

1413
00:55:35,985 --> 00:55:38,215
There's a lot of soy sauce.

1414
00:55:40,055 --> 00:55:41,840
- I can smell it. - Gosh.

1415
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,670
- It's the same as yesterday. - It is.

1416
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,470
It's the same jokbal as yesterday.

1417
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,685
Add the noodles.

1418
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,840
It's the same as yesterday.

1419
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,325
(It's the same soba as yesterday.)

1420
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:55,050
It's known as a tasty restaurant among the locals.

1421
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,290
As it's adjusted to the locals' taste,

1422
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:00,260
the smell could be quite strong.

1423
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,720
- It's still delicious. - It's delicious.

1424
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,460
It's not the soba...

1425
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,990
- that we're used to. Right. - We have warm buckwheat soba too.

1426
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,200
It's similar to that.

1427
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,930
- Go ahead. - I'll take enough.

1428
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,615
Eat some meat.

1429
00:56:11,185 --> 00:56:13,540
Isn't it Seok Jin's turn now?

1430
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,520
- Seok Jin eats much more. - No.

1431
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:17,270
- This reminds me. - What?

1432
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:19,710
- Eat a lot. - We came all the way to Okinawa.

1433
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,555
In this park that we don't know...

1434
00:56:22,465 --> 00:56:26,730
(They were hoping for steak and sushi.)

1435
00:56:26,735 --> 00:56:29,950
(They're eating soba in the middle of a park.)

1436
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:32,735
People will think that we're sharing a bowl.

1437
00:56:33,035 --> 00:56:35,260
If we get another recommendation for soba...

1438
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,420
It's delicious.

1439
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,590
If we stay within 20km, that's...

1440
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,930
- the soba restaurant to go to. - If that happens again...

1441
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,230
- We'll go back there. - Right.

1442
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,100
If the restaurant is full, we'll eat it here again.

1443
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,470
(That's the worst part.)

1444
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,610
That's scarier than Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

1445
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,140
- That'd be terrible. - It's Super Scary Soba.

1446
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,755
- We'll go there. - Super Scary Soba.

1447
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:54,585
(Super Scary Soba)

1448
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:57,995
(They must escape this place by carefully spinning the globe.)

1449
00:56:58,065 --> 00:56:59,725
Let's spin it.

1450
00:56:59,905 --> 00:57:02,650
Spin well so that we get to see various dishes.

1451
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,190
- That's what we want too. - Seriously.

1452
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,990
- For the viewers, - Right.

1453
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,170
we want to show them what kind of food there is in Okinawa.

1454
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:13,200
We went to the same soba restaurant twice.

1455
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,130
They'll think that it's a mistake.

1456
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:17,200
- Right. - They'll think it's a rerun.

1457
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,370
How about...

1458
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,840
- So Min this time? - Me?

1459
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,270
We need someone like...

1460
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,245
a taxi driver to get out of here.

1461
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:25,310
I'm getting nervous.

1462
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,520
Hit it a few times.

1463
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:29,585
- Hit it like that. - It's spinning.

1464
00:57:29,935 --> 00:57:33,050
In 1, 2, 3.

1465
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,150
(Taxi driver is the best choice.)

1466
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,690
I'm getting nervous.

1467
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,895
Hit it a few times.

1468
00:57:37,905 --> 00:57:39,965
- Hit it like that. - It's spinning.

1469
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:43,430
In 1, 2, 3.

1470
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:44,605
(Taxi driver is the best choice.)

1471
00:57:45,445 --> 00:57:46,630
What?

1472
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,045
(Someone over 90)

1473
00:57:49,275 --> 00:57:52,270
"Someone over 90".

1474
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:55,315
People over 90 must love soba.

1475
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:58,870
(There were many elderly people in the soba restaurant.)

1476
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:00,280
Soba is a traditional food.

1477
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,510
You're right.

1478
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,850
- People over 90... - There were many in the restaurant.

1479
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,610
- The soba restaurant? - The customers...

1480
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:09,320
They'll recommend the same soba restaurant.

1481
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,920
(Pull yourself together.)

1482
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,065
We could ask where else they usually eat.

1483
00:58:14,305 --> 00:58:15,490
Please give us one more chance.

1484
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,260
You have to say, "Start".

1485
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,690
- Let's go. 1, 2, 3. - Start.

1486
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:21,205
- Start. - Start.

1487
00:58:21,705 --> 00:58:23,700
- So Min, pick one. - Pick one.

1488
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,545
(This is their last chance to get out of this labyrinth.)

1489
00:58:26,645 --> 00:58:31,815
(We have to get away from this area.)

1490
00:58:32,315 --> 00:58:33,940
- "Convenience store clerk". - "Convenience store clerk".

1491
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,615
(Convenience store clerk)

1492
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:39,285
Hey.

1493
00:58:39,295 --> 00:58:41,920
The closest store is the one we've been to.

1494
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,550
(The clerk at the only store in the area recommended ramen.)

1495
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,465
They recommended ramen,

1496
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:49,260
and after we ate ramen,

1497
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,630
someone recommended soba.

1498
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,290
- You set us up, right? - Jae Seok.

1499
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:54,000
- It's a trap, right? - Are you sure there's no button?

1500
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,060
There's a button, right?

1501
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,200
There's no button. It's impossible to control the result.

1502
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,475
We have to obey the rules.

1503
00:58:59,615 --> 00:59:02,180
- Let's go back to the store. - Again?

1504
00:59:02,185 --> 00:59:03,300
Again?

1505
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,585
No!

1506
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:06,610
- Seriously... - Please!

1507
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,510
- Hey. - No more noodles! I want meat!

1508
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,010
- Okinawa is large. - Please.

1509
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,920
There are many good restaurants in Okinawa.

1510
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,980
- There are sushi, - Our step counters...

1511
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,320
- tonkatsu... - We don't care about step counters.

1512
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,050
We have to get out of this area.

1513
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,290
- I don't want any more soba. - As soon as we woke up,

1514
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:25,390
we came here, excited.

1515
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,105
As soon as the restaurant opened.

1516
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:30,370
Convenience store clerks and taxi drivers keep recommending...

1517
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,630
soba.

1518
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,775
Taxi drivers recommend soba, convenience store clerks ramen.

1519
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:35,900
Soba, ramen, soba, ramen...

1520
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:39,110
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go to the convenience store.

1521
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:41,010
- Let's go. - Convenience stores...

1522
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,880
are open 24 hours a day. There might be a new clerk.

1523
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,410
That's right. The man who was there last night can't still be there.

1524
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,780
- Let's go. - Gosh.

1525
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,295
How is this possible?

1526
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:53,490
Anything except soba would work.

1527
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,490
Anything except soba.

1528
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:55,620
- And ramen. - And ramen.

1529
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,430
Anything except soba and ramen.

1530
00:59:57,435 --> 00:59:59,205
I really don't want any more ramen.

1531
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:01,775
Let me tell you.

1532
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:03,700
If I have one more bowl of soba,

1533
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,375
I'll be able to make it myself.

1534
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:07,900
I'll be able to make it.

1535
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,640
The stock is based on soy sauce.

1536
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,670
(He's analyzed the ingredients.)

1537
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,885
I want rice, not noodles.

1538
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,925
We passed this street last night.

1539
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:20,595
- Did we? - Yes.

1540
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,150
We even remember the way.

1541
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:23,690
(Amazed)

1542
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,520
Do you know what bothers me the most?

1543
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,290
On this sunny day in Okinawa, we're walking around the same place.

1544
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:31,360
This area isn't even beautiful.

1545
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,730
I want to go back to International Street.

1546
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,500
There are so many good restaurants on that street.

1547
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,445
Why would they recommend a place in this area?

1548
01:00:38,745 --> 01:00:41,000
That's where you farted last night.

1549
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
That's right.

1550
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,470
(They're back on the fart street.)

1551
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:48,480
Even the wind direction is the same.

1552
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,680
(The wind direction is the same.)

1553
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:51,880
The wind blew in this direction.

1554
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,280
Even the wind blows in the same direction.

1555
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,620
(It's like a Moebius strip.)

1556
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,850
Don't fart.

1557
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,520
If you fart again, everything will be the same.

1558
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,895
Don't fart.

1559
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:03,290
Okay. Let's cheer up.

1560
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,090
- No. - Let's get excited.

1561
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,660
(Let's cheer up. Let's get excited.)

1562
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,300
- Stay calm, or you might fart. - Okay.

1563
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,400
Let's stay hopeful. We're here.

1564
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,015
(They have arrived.)

1565
01:01:14,285 --> 01:01:16,370
Hold on. There are so many customers.

1566
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:17,710
It's the only convenience store in this area.

1567
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:19,085
(The store is full.)

1568
01:01:19,855 --> 01:01:22,310
If all of us go in, we'll become a nuisance.

1569
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:24,410
- Let's send one person in. - Okay.

1570
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,810
- And ask the question. - Buy something,

1571
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,225
- and ask this question. - Okay.

1572
01:01:29,695 --> 01:01:31,320
See if it's the same man.

1573
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,120
I don't think so.

1574
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,660
- It looks like a woman. - I can't see.

1575
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:37,030
- It's a woman, right? - It is.

1576
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,990
- Okay. - The loser will go in?

1577
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:40,500
It doesn't matter.

1578
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,935
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1579
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:43,500
I win.

1580
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,700
Rock-paper-scissors

1581
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,300
(Kyeong Hwan loses.)

1582
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,370
Kyeong Hwan, you go in.

1583
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,370
Kyeong Hwan...

1584
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,980
She looks like the type of person who likes soba.

1585
01:01:51,985 --> 01:01:54,310
You should sound like someone who likes meat.

1586
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,310
Just speak naturally.

1587
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,950
"Excuse me."

1588
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,010
- You sound like a woman. - "I..."

1589
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:00,650
Why do you speak like a woman?

1590
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,580
- Let me try. - Hold on.

1591
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:05,125
I've been traumatized because of So Min.

1592
01:02:05,495 --> 01:02:12,290
(So Min has been saying Jae Seok sounds like a Japanese woman.)

1593
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:17,175
(Jae Seok has been traumatized.)

1594
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:19,700
After all this time in Japan,

1595
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,200
I'm traumatized.

1596
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,010
I can't speak Japanese anymore.

1597
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,640
- "No more soba." Start. - Start.

1598
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:27,380
- No more soba - No more soba

1599
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:29,255
She might hear us and recommend soba.

1600
01:02:29,385 --> 01:02:31,310
- Here I come. - I don't think she heard.

1601
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:32,450
(He approaches the clerk.)

1602
01:02:32,455 --> 01:02:35,595
Speak naturally. Don't sound too cheesy.

1603
01:02:37,465 --> 01:02:39,295
I'll get a bottle of coke.

1604
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:40,935
A bottle of coke.

1605
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:43,905
I'm nervous. I can't hear anything.

1606
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,905
And...

1607
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:49,205
Is it really okay to shoot the same thing over and over?

1608
01:02:49,275 --> 01:02:51,630
- Okinawa has many delicious dishes. - This is too much.

1609
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:53,630
- Japanese food is so popular. - We're in Okinawa.

1610
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:56,000
We should try the restaurants on International Street.

1611
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,985
I'm so shocked.

1612
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:00,880
What are you filming?

1613
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,040
(The camera is facing the wrong direction.)

1614
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,580
- Oh, right. - What are you filming?

1615
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,650
(Why is it facing that way?)

1616
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,120
- Have you been filming the staff? - What are you doing?

1617
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,765
- Why would you film Chul Min? - Right.

1618
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:16,035
(So Min has been filming the staff all day.)

1619
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:18,905
Just return it.

1620
01:03:18,975 --> 01:03:20,090
Gosh.

1621
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,300
(I at least filmed something.)

1622
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,435
Right.

1623
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,545
Does she like steak?

1624
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:29,500
Here.

1625
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,870
(Kyeong Hwan is standing close to the clerk.)

1626
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:36,010
(Cheesy)

1627
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:39,085
(He practices the question.)

1628
01:03:40,225 --> 01:03:43,895
(He is standing in front of the clerk.)

1629
01:03:44,665 --> 01:03:46,220
- He's going to start. - He's starting soon.

1630
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,665
My goodness.

1631
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:50,635
- He's going to start. - Please.

1632
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:53,900
I don't even hope for steak anymore.

1633
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,000
I just want to avoid noodles.

1634
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,100
Tonkatsu, sushi...

1635
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,730
- I don't want any more soba. - He's asking her.

1636
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,200
(Kyeong Hwan is asking the question.)

1637
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,200
He's asking her.

1638
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,945
(No noodles, yes steak)

1639
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:05,285
He's asking her.

1640
01:04:07,685 --> 01:04:14,220
(Please recommend a delicious dish to us.)

1641
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,365
(Desperate)

1642
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:20,965
(A dish?)

1643
01:04:21,635 --> 01:04:24,605
She's wearing a mask. I can't read her lips.

1644
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:26,130
Oh, my.

1645
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,830
(No more noodles, please.)

1646
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,275
Please don't say noodles.

1647
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:35,015
(Stress-related stomach pain)

1648
01:04:35,445 --> 01:04:36,570
My stomach aches again.

1649
01:04:36,570 --> 01:04:38,840
(The staff members burst into laughter.)

1650
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:40,780
- My stomach aches again. What? - It's over?

1651
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,785
- Did she say soba? - What happened?

1652
01:04:43,025 --> 01:04:44,380
If it's soba again...

1653
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,010
Gosh. Please.

1654
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:48,580
If it's soba again, I'll kill you.

1655
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,120
I won't forgive you.

1656
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,020
If it's the same restaurant again...

1657
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,160
Guys, I won't forgive you.

1658
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,205
You'll see me angry for the first time.

1659
01:04:57,235 --> 01:04:58,690
Stop joking.

1660
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:01,475
I'm going to cry. Please don't do this.

1661
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:03,400
Don't you want to film something else?

1662
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,100
(He is asking the cameramen.)

1663
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,670
Don't you? Kwon Ryeol.

1664
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,840
You want to film something new, right?

1665
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,745
We're even wearing the same clothes. Nothing has changed.

1666
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,685
She's pointing to a different direction.

1667
01:05:16,755 --> 01:05:18,480
- A different direction? - It's a different direction.

1668
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,680
(She is pointing the opposite direction from the soba place.)

1669
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,720
- It's that way? - It's that way.

1670
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,855
(There is still hope.)

1671
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:27,590
(The clerk is making everyone confused.)

1672
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:32,235
(What did she recommend?)

1673
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:37,035
(Ramen)

1674
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:41,670
(Did you say ramen?)

1675
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:43,040
- Okinawa ramen? - Yes.

1676
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,710
(Yesterday)

1677
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:48,915
(Different place, same answer)

1678
01:05:49,725 --> 01:05:52,880
Excuse me. Do you mean ramen?

1679
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,150
Really?

1680
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:55,795
Yes. It's the best.

1681
01:05:56,695 --> 01:05:58,990
Ramen...

1682
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,565
Is it that way?

1683
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,360
(They have to first go in the direction of the soba place.)

1684
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,360
Is it there?

1685
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,375
I don't want to come to Japan with Seok Jin and Jae Seok again.

1686
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:11,500
- It's not our fault. - Seriously...

1687
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,830
You...

1688
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,300
He should have spoken naturally. His Japanese sounds too cheesy.

1689
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,445
We still don't know.

1690
01:06:18,385 --> 01:06:20,610
(How am I going to tell them?)

1691
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:21,610
How should I tell them?

1692
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,410
(It's ramen, not soba.)

1693
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:27,355
(It went well.)

1694
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,995
My goodness.

1695
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:32,050
His face... He says it's something good.

1696
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,365
- He says it's something good. - Okay.

1697
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:36,120
- That's a relief. - It's something good.

1698
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,600
(It must not be soba or ramen.)

1699
01:06:37,605 --> 01:06:38,760
What's taking him so long?

1700
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,200
(It's great.)

1701
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,405
How should I tell them?

1702
01:06:43,075 --> 01:06:44,300
It's ramen.

1703
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:46,310
(She kindly draws the map of the ramen place.)

1704
01:06:46,315 --> 01:06:47,970
- He's coming. - I think it worked.

1705
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:50,000
His face looks okay. Did we guess it right?

1706
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,410
- Oh, gosh. - What is it?

1707
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:53,810
- I'm so sweaty. - We have an idea.

1708
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,420
- Why did you take so long? - You're sweating.

1709
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:58,510
- Where are we going? - Look. Do you see it?

1710
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:00,650
- Where is it? - If you look here,

1711
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,580
- it's a different place. - That's right.

1712
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,620
This is...

1713
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,290
a very popular ramen place...

1714
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:06,450
in Okinawa.

1715
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:08,695
(This is a very popular ramen place in Okinawa.)

1716
01:07:08,865 --> 01:07:11,430
(Did we hear that wrong?)

1717
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,830
It's very popular.

1718
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,005
She recommended ramen without hesitating.

1719
01:07:16,245 --> 01:07:17,500
I asked her a few times.

1720
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,970
- "Really"? - Ramen?

1721
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:20,640
- Yes. - Isn't it down there?

1722
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,645
My forehead is full of sweat.

1723
01:07:22,685 --> 01:07:24,570
I sweated the amount of ramen soup.

1724
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:26,070
- Where is it? - Sorry?

1725
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:27,740
It's a 10-minute walk back this way.

1726
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,515
She said it's a tremendous ramen place.

1727
01:07:31,495 --> 01:07:34,450
Don't people eat sushi or pork cutlet here?

1728
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,680
No?

1729
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,850
I think our trip today...

1730
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:39,390
is not a random tour.

1731
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,100
It's a soba, ramen tour.

1732
01:07:41,105 --> 01:07:43,390
Soba and ramen.

1733
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:50,500
(Even if you like noodles, you'll get sick of soba and ramen.)

1734
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,130
Soba and ramen. It's soba next.

1735
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:56,340
Our interpreter looked at the map and said that...

1736
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:59,970
if you go back the way you came, it's past the soba place.

1737
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:01,985
(It's past the soba place they were at earlier.)

1738
01:08:02,355 --> 01:08:04,485
- We have to go back there? - Really?

1739
01:08:04,825 --> 01:08:07,725
So we can't get away from here. We can't get away from this area.

1740
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:11,225
Are we touring around the soba place?

1741
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:13,820
Are we advertising soba?

1742
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:15,760
Do you know the owner of the restaurant?

1743
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,735
I think we're advertising the entire street.

1744
01:08:17,935 --> 01:08:19,290
It's that street.

1745
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,130
What does that soba mean to us?

1746
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,500
I don't know what that street is.

1747
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,430
It's a little bit past the soba place.

1748
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:26,970
- At this state... - It's ramen.

1749
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:28,040
(Let's go back the way we came...)

1750
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,300
(for ramen.)

1751
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,415
Oh, gosh. This is driving me nuts.

1752
01:08:31,555 --> 01:08:32,740
- Kyeong Hwan. - Yes.

1753
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,480
Thanks for letting us walk back.

1754
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,410
- No problem. - This feels new.

1755
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,850
It's a ramen place so rather than not knowing the way,

1756
01:08:38,855 --> 01:08:41,595
it's better to take the same way. We know the route.

1757
01:08:42,065 --> 01:08:44,590
- I want to go home. - I feel sick.

1758
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:46,950
- I want to go home too. - Me too.

1759
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:48,595
I want to eat kimchi stew at home.

1760
01:08:48,935 --> 01:08:50,690
We're here. I see it.

1761
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:52,190
- I see it too. - There.

1762
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,590
- Where? - It's the soba place.

1763
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:54,935
- It's the soba place. - Oh, dear.

1764
01:08:55,345 --> 01:08:56,700
Hey.

1765
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,470
If people see us go back and forth,

1766
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,900
they'll wonder what we're doing.

1767
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:02,115
(The people at the soba place will wonder.)

1768
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:04,110
This is no joke.

1769
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,715
(They plod back down the way.)

1770
01:09:06,785 --> 01:09:09,215
- Here he is. - Soba?

1771
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:10,715
Here he is.

1772
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:15,180
He's the owner of the ramen restaurant.

1773
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:16,395
(He's the owner of the restaurant they went to yesterday.)

1774
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:18,490
(The owner recognizes them.)

1775
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:20,095
Sir!

1776
01:09:21,065 --> 01:09:22,820
Goodness. Sir.

1777
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,360
Hello.

1778
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,160
(He served them their first ramen.)

1779
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,835
He's the owner of the ramen restaurant.

1780
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:31,445
We can't get away from ramen and soba.

1781
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:36,215
I'm going to work. Do you want to come with me?

1782
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:38,510
We have to go to another ramen place.

1783
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:41,280
He has to watch this on TV to know what situation we're in.

1784
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:44,425
Tell him we've been having ramen and soba for four meals.

1785
01:09:44,825 --> 01:09:46,050
Really?

1786
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:49,050
We had soba and ramen yesterday,

1787
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:50,580
then soba and ramen again.

1788
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:51,925
We're going to another ramen place.

1789
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:53,665
His stomach looks full.

1790
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:57,095
- It's full of ramen. - I know. I'm full.

1791
01:09:58,105 --> 01:10:00,905
I looked up on the internet, and they are really famous.

1792
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:03,260
He found out that you guys are famous.

1793
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,470
(He looked up Running Man last time.)

1794
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,540
May I take a picture of you?

1795
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,570
(He wants to keep a picture as a memory.)

1796
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:09,670
Can he take a picture of you?

1797
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,740
We should move.

1798
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,810
(Of course.)

1799
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:14,010
This is so funny. We met him.

1800
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,380
It was so nice to see him again.

1801
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,310
We keep going around the neighborhood,

1802
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:18,610
so we meet people we know.

1803
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:20,180
(They meet people they know.)

1804
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,455
Come here.

1805
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:24,390
We have a friend in Okinawa.

1806
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,095
He's our neighbor.

1807
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:28,690
I wish you success in your business.

1808
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,295
- See you again. - Thank you.

1809
01:10:31,435 --> 01:10:33,760
- How could this happen? - Goodness.

1810
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:36,205
We have a friend here now.

1811
01:10:36,905 --> 01:10:38,170
We have a neighbor now.

1812
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,300
(They make themselves a friend.)

1813
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:40,770
Once I return to Korea,

1814
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,115
I'm going to say my friend owns a ramen place.

1815
01:10:43,385 --> 01:10:45,010
My friend owns a ramen place.

1816
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:46,810
We're dominating this street.

1817
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,310
(They dominated an alley in Okinawa.)

1818
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,385
We're not sheriffs of Okinawa.

1819
01:10:50,585 --> 01:10:53,480
Thanks for giving me a great memory, guys.

1820
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,755
I was excited about coming to Okinawa.

1821
01:10:56,895 --> 01:10:59,390
We didn't even see the ocean. I heard it's really nice.

1822
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:02,060
Everybody, do you see the similar restaurant sign?

1823
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,090
Isn't this it?

1824
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:05,065
(They'll swim in the ramen soup instead of the ocean.)

1825
01:11:05,935 --> 01:11:08,005
- Here it is. - We're here.

1826
01:11:08,345 --> 01:11:09,530
Here it is.

1827
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,400
(This is not a replay. This is another good ramen place.)

1828
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,975
- Here it is. - It looks famous. It looks good.

1829
01:11:15,315 --> 01:11:16,700
It's not full.

1830
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:19,450
(He's disappointed.)

1831
01:11:19,455 --> 01:11:21,780
- It's not full. - Did you hear Kyeong Hwan?

1832
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,480
"It's not full."

1833
01:11:23,485 --> 01:11:25,010
We have to go in now.

1834
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,120
(He was expecting it to be full.)

1835
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:28,755
- Whatever. - Everybody is suffering.

1836
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:32,450
We had ramen and the time...

1837
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:34,600
- What time is it? - We just had ramen.

1838
01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:36,820
We can try one more time.

1839
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:38,260
We can only try one more time.

1840
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,300
- This is our last chance then. - It is.

1841
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:42,400
Let's spin the globe. We have no time.

1842
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,675
(The globe they love and hate is back.)

1843
01:11:43,845 --> 01:11:47,130
- No more convenience store, please. - I want to get away.

1844
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,940
- We have to get away. - But...

1845
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,640
we don't have time to find somebody named Suzuki...

1846
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,110
- or somebody over 90. - We have no time.

1847
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:55,585
The only way for us to survive is to get a taxi driver.

1848
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:57,055
Who wants to do it?

1849
01:11:57,595 --> 01:11:58,750
I'll try it.

1850
01:11:58,750 --> 01:11:59,885
I'll spin it.

1851
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:01,180
- You keep doing that. - Fine.

1852
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,925
- I'll do it. Start. - Start.

1853
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,720
- Start. - Start.

1854
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:06,695
(This is their last chance.)

1855
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:10,120
(They don't have time to find people.)

1856
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,190
(They're hoping to get a taxi driver.)

1857
01:12:13,190 --> 01:12:14,800
- It's Suzuki. - "Someone called Suzuki".

1858
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,205
(They get "someone called Suzuki".)

1859
01:12:18,645 --> 01:12:21,500
(It's Suzuki.)

1860
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,570
Suzuki?

1861
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,510
I asked, and apparently, it's hard to find someone named Suzuki...

1862
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,910
in Okinawa.

1863
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,610
It's hard to find Suzuki, and you have no time.

1864
01:12:27,610 --> 01:12:29,180
Yes, it's too difficult.

1865
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,480
You won the chance card yesterday.

1866
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,825
- Please help us. - Yes.

1867
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:36,580
(Team Yu-So-Body won a game and got a chance card...)

1868
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,695
(which will help them in the mission.)

1869
01:12:40,035 --> 01:12:43,820
You can use the chance card to switch to another last name.

1870
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,230
(They can use the chance card to switch to another last name.)

1871
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:47,700
A different last name?

1872
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,170
What is the most common last name?

1873
01:12:49,175 --> 01:12:50,560
We looked it up,

1874
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,870
and in Okinawa,

1875
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,500
- the most common last name is Higa. - Higa?

1876
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,515
Out of 1.5 million people, there are 50,000 people.

1877
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:59,145
- There's 1 in 30 chance. - Higa.

1878
01:12:59,455 --> 01:13:01,185
(Wait. It's Higa?)

1879
01:13:01,555 --> 01:13:03,615
Well...

1880
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,610
She's going.

1881
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,710
(She goes to the ramen place to find someone called Higa.)

1882
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:08,150
Excuse me.

1883
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:09,850
Is Mr. Higa here?

1884
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,425
(Please)

1885
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:15,890
(An employee approaches them.)

1886
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:21,260
(Will they find someone called Higa this fast?)

1887
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:22,330
I'm not Higa.

1888
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:24,975
(There are none amongst the employees.)

1889
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:26,800
(Of course.)

1890
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,470
- There's a Higa? - Higa.

1891
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,085
If you ask them, they're going to recommend ramen.

1892
01:13:32,015 --> 01:13:33,885
He'll say ramen.

1893
01:13:33,915 --> 01:13:36,240
- They have to come out. - Come out.

1894
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,050
We have to go to a steak restaurant and ask.

1895
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,280
Come out.

1896
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,550
(They're banned from approaching any ramen place.)

1897
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,850
If you ask here,

1898
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,725
they're going to recommend ramen again.

1899
01:13:43,925 --> 01:13:45,120
Then...

1900
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,520
we don't have time, right?

1901
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:49,760
Let's go with Higa.

1902
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,030
(They switch to Higa which is more common than Suzuki.)

1903
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,435
Instead of Higa, can we do "somebody with a good impression"?

1904
01:13:53,775 --> 01:13:55,030
"Somebody with a good feeling".

1905
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,330
(Can't we do that?)

1906
01:13:56,330 --> 01:14:00,800
You punk, I'm going to hit you.

1907
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,000
(We don't have time. Let's go find somebody called Higa.)

1908
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,215
Let's hurry.

1909
01:14:05,715 --> 01:14:07,370
It makes me happy whenever I come here.

1910
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,340
What do you say again?

1911
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:10,910
- What was it? - This looks the same as before.

1912
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:12,180
It's the same as well.

1913
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:14,650
- Higa... - What was it again?

1914
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,620
- "Is Higa here?" - "Is Higa here?"

1915
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:17,990
I'm happy to see so many people.

1916
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:19,665
(At least there are many people here.)

1917
01:14:19,795 --> 01:14:22,260
(It's International Street with many tourists,)

1918
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,065
(so they might find a Higa.)

1919
01:14:25,535 --> 01:14:27,800
We have no time.

1920
01:14:27,805 --> 01:14:30,060
- Mr. Higa? - Hey.

1921
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:32,000
(Mr. Higa...)

1922
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,230
(She's shooting...)

1923
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:38,040
("Love Letter" on her own.)

1924
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:39,970
(Stop shooting a movie. Let's find them.)

1925
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:41,685
Hey, you can't do that.

1926
01:14:41,785 --> 01:14:44,240
You can't yell for Mr. Higa here.

1927
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,310
- Hold on. Let's split... - Okay.

1928
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,980
and find Mr. or Ms. Higa. We have no time.

1929
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,825
- Mr. Higa. - Let's find him or her.

1930
01:14:50,195 --> 01:14:52,395
We have to find them. We have no time.

1931
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:53,850
Excuse me.

1932
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:56,135
(Jae Seok finds a target.)

1933
01:14:56,265 --> 01:14:57,560
Are you Mr. Higa?

1934
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,130
(Please... Are you Mr. Higa?)

1935
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,430
- Higa? - I'm Chinese.

1936
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,500
(He's confused.)

1937
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,735
Sorry.

1938
01:15:02,905 --> 01:15:05,545
It's International Street, so there are many foreigners.

1939
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,170
Excuse me.

1940
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,400
We're Korean.

1941
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,215
Are you Korean? I see.

1942
01:15:11,585 --> 01:15:13,110
(She looks around.)

1943
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:14,445
Okay, I got this.

1944
01:15:15,355 --> 01:15:16,840
I'm going to ask her.

1945
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,155
(So Min finds a target.)

1946
01:15:18,695 --> 01:15:20,120
Excuse me.

1947
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:21,550
Are you Ms. Higa?

1948
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:22,850
No.

1949
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,525
Thank you.

1950
01:15:25,435 --> 01:15:29,220
(She starts repeating "Excuse me" and "Thank you".)

1951
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:31,830
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Higa?

1952
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:33,005
(No, we're not.)

1953
01:15:33,605 --> 01:15:35,500
(She ends with a thank you again.)

1954
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,500
There are none. What do we do?

1955
01:15:37,505 --> 01:15:38,845
What should we do?

1956
01:15:39,145 --> 01:15:41,575
Are you Ms. Higa?

1957
01:15:41,715 --> 01:15:42,970
Ms. Higa?

1958
01:15:42,970 --> 01:15:45,645
(She points at her friend.)

1959
01:15:45,815 --> 01:15:48,640
(Are you Ms. Higa?)

1960
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,680
Are you Ms. Higa?

1961
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,410
(Me?)

1962
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,480
I found Ms. Higa.

1963
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,055
(Where is her friend going?)

1964
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:59,150
(He found Ms. Higa?)

1965
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:01,095
- Yes. - It's Ms. Higa.

1966
01:16:01,535 --> 01:16:03,560
- It's Ms. Higa. - We found her.

1967
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,365
- We found Ms. Higa. - Ms. Higa?

1968
01:16:05,535 --> 01:16:07,660
(She's so happy.)

1969
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,035
They found her?

1970
01:16:09,145 --> 01:16:10,330
Who?

1971
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,700
Her friend pointed at her.

1972
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:13,400
(They ask her for an ID to check her name.)

1973
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,245
Here it is. It's Ms. Higa.

1974
01:16:15,545 --> 01:16:16,770
Are we right?

1975
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:19,440
(They find a person named Higa.)

1976
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,340
It is. Yes!

1977
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,110
We found her.

1978
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,440
Thank you.

1979
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:25,650
Where were you going?

1980
01:16:25,655 --> 01:16:28,520
- Ms. Higa. - Ms. Higa, thank you.

1981
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,380
- Ms. Higa. - Let's ask her.

1982
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,650
- Who wants to ask her? - I'm getting nervous.

1983
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,920
- I'll ask. - Use a nice voice.

1984
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,420
I'll ask her the question.

1985
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,035
- Excuse me. - You have one chance.

1986
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:38,490
- We can do this. - Please just once.

1987
01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:40,590
- Please. - Please, Ms. Higa.

1988
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:41,600
- Please. - Okay.

1989
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,835
Excuse me.

1990
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:49,470
What food and restaurant would you like to recommend?

1991
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:53,085
(What does she recommend?)

1992
01:16:53,755 --> 01:16:59,325
(For two days, they couldn't get away from noodles.)

1993
01:16:59,425 --> 01:17:02,955
(If they get steak, they win and can go home right away.)

1994
01:17:02,965 --> 01:17:08,090
(Will she give them the answer they want?)

1995
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,560
Black ramen?

1996
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:14,465
(It's garlic and soy sauce ramen.)

1997
01:17:16,205 --> 01:17:17,635
(Sighing)

1998
01:17:19,645 --> 01:17:21,545
Ramen?

1999
01:17:21,785 --> 01:17:23,500
- Ramen? - I like it.

2000
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,110
Ramen, Ms. Higa?

2001
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:27,185
- Ramen? - Yes.

2002
01:17:27,515 --> 01:17:30,015
I like ramen.

2003
01:17:31,825 --> 01:17:33,625
Thank you so much.

2004
01:17:34,295 --> 01:17:37,860
Thank you.

2005
01:17:37,865 --> 01:17:39,995
- I had so much ramen. - Ramen.

2006
01:17:40,665 --> 01:17:43,160
- This is hard to believe. - Ramen again?

2007
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:45,105
- What do you recommend next? - Next?

2008
01:17:45,735 --> 01:17:47,135
Next?

2009
01:17:47,475 --> 01:17:49,830
Okinawa soba.

2010
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,330
Soba.

2011
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,375
Soba!

2012
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:56,100
- Soba. - Okinawa soba.

2013
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,445
Okinawa soba.

2014
01:17:58,515 --> 01:18:00,240
- Okinawa soba wasn't the 1st one. - What about 3rd?

2015
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,385
- What's the 3rd thing? - Okinawa soba.

2016
01:18:02,455 --> 01:18:03,985
Third one.

2017
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:06,525
- Steak? - Steak.

2018
01:18:06,855 --> 01:18:09,080
It was the third choice.

2019
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,320
It's the third choice.

2020
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,395
- It was the third choice. - We wanted steak.

2021
01:18:13,765 --> 01:18:15,490
Thank you.

2022
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:17,960
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2023
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,235
- Bye. - Bye.

2024
01:18:21,805 --> 01:18:25,070
If we didn't ask for number one, we would have still had soba.

2025
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,930
Sushi is not even in top three.

2026
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:29,975
We can't have ramen again. Look, man.

2027
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:32,770
- We just had ramen. - I'm so full.

2028
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:34,510
You should try the ramen.

2029
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,680
We can't eat it anymore.

2030
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,710
Maybe this is what it is.

2031
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:39,685
Maybe the entire place is a studio.

2032
01:18:40,995 --> 01:18:47,490
(Maybe this is the Mobius strip of noodles,)

2033
01:18:47,495 --> 01:18:54,260
(and perhaps the people we met were all actors.)

2034
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,900
- Did they recruit these people? - Maybe they did.

2035
01:18:56,905 --> 01:18:59,975
How can Ms. Higa recommend ramen again?

2036
01:19:00,475 --> 01:19:02,045
This doesn't make sense.

2037
01:19:02,685 --> 01:19:05,145
We had 2 soba and 3 ramen.

2038
01:19:05,455 --> 01:19:07,470
It's 2 soba and 3 ramen.

2039
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:09,410
- 2 soba and 3 ramen. - I'm sick of this.

2040
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,410
We had 2 soba and 3 ramen in Okinawa.

2041
01:19:11,410 --> 01:19:13,310
How is it possible we only had ramen?

2042
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,880
- Let's go. We have no time. - My gosh.

2043
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:16,050
Let's just eat.

2044
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:18,020
I get so happy before asking the question...

2045
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,850
and get down after asking.

2046
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,665
(They go back again and find another ramen place.)

2047
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:26,405
(The second morning in Daema Island has arrived.)

2048
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,600
(They get home-made food before going out to fish.)

2049
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,670
It's shiny.

2050
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:32,730
(Their goal is to catch this fish.)

2051
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:33,830
Eat up.

2052
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,000
(They look tired after fighting over the step counters last night.)

2053
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,015
If we don't catch everything,

2054
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:42,755
- we'll get 8,000 steps added. - Right, if we're not successful.

2055
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:44,885
I thought about this too.

2056
01:19:45,425 --> 01:19:48,620
What if I become last place in the losing team...

2057
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,620
and exercise some authority?

2058
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,290
(The loser can pick whom to receive the punishment with.)

2059
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,890
(That's a tempting idea.)

2060
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:57,160
- You're a genius. - I don't want to be scared.

2061
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:58,990
I'm really scared of you right now.

2062
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:00,190
- Me? - Yes.

2063
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,570
I'm more scared of you now.

2064
01:20:01,575 --> 01:20:04,800
Then let's do it this way.

2065
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,545
- What if we shake it as we eat? - Stop.

2066
01:20:07,675 --> 01:20:09,140
(Sang Yeob changed a lot over a day.)

2067
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,340
- Sang Yeob. - Should I not do it?

2068
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,410
Let's eat.

2069
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,540
Okay.

2070
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,315
You're so cool.

2071
01:20:15,425 --> 01:20:17,685
He needs another step counter.

2072
01:20:17,995 --> 01:20:20,650
(They go fishing with Sang Yeob who is turning into a monster.)

2073
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,555
It's so nice out.

2074
01:20:22,725 --> 01:20:27,665
- We're starting again - We're starting again

2075
01:20:28,965 --> 01:20:31,605
It's just a step counter.

2076
01:20:31,835 --> 01:20:34,235
Running Man is kind of strange.

2077
01:20:35,045 --> 01:20:37,130
Once we return home, this is nothing.

2078
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,670
- That's true. - The R sticker, ddakji,

2079
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:43,300
and this. This makes no sense.

2080
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:44,700
- I know, right? - What is all this?

2081
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,840
I get obsessed whenever I do this.

2082
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:47,840
Goodness.

2083
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,315
I thought I was a nice person.

2084
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:52,590
Last night,

2085
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:56,095
I learned that I can hit people.

2086
01:20:56,695 --> 01:20:58,765
You shouldn't shoot dramas for a while.

2087
01:20:59,395 --> 01:21:02,995
- Stay home on Mondays and Tuesdays. - Make sure you take those days off.

2088
01:21:04,365 --> 01:21:06,790
After I was on Running Man last time,

2089
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,960
I had more offers for variety shows than dramas.

2090
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:09,960
Really?

2091
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,870
Maybe I should ask websites to add...

2092
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:14,500
"entertainer" in my profile.

2093
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,740
Maybe I need to ask.

2094
01:21:16,745 --> 01:21:19,040
This is the age of creators.

2095
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,585
You have to be good at everything.

2096
01:21:21,215 --> 01:21:22,840
We'll be doing comedy next week.

2097
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:24,255
(Get yourself ready.)

2098
01:21:25,955 --> 01:21:27,655
I have an album coming out next week.

2099
01:21:28,495 --> 01:21:29,850
(Running Man raises all-around entertainers.)

2100
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,665
You're a genius.

2101
01:21:31,765 --> 01:21:34,620
Gosh, you guys are geniuses of variety shows.

2102
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,090
(They arrive in a fishing village covered by wet fog.)

2103
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:37,260
There's wet fog.

2104
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,765
She's right.

2105
01:21:39,175 --> 01:21:40,630
This is amazing.

2106
01:21:40,635 --> 01:21:42,300
It's so clean and nice.

2107
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,205
The water is so clean.

2108
01:21:44,945 --> 01:21:46,230
I can see the bottom.

2109
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,475
(Will they be able to catch 8 types of fish here?)

2110
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:51,610
He's an expert...

2111
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:52,870
who will help you today.

2112
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:54,610
- Hello. - Hello.

2113
01:21:54,610 --> 01:21:55,980
Nice to meet you.

2114
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,010
Sorry we're dressed like this.

2115
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:59,610
If he catches some fish,

2116
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,850
does it count?

2117
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:03,020
We're a team.

2118
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,490
We're a family.

2119
01:22:04,495 --> 01:22:05,750
Aren't we a team?

2120
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,725
He should get a step counter right now.

2121
01:22:08,035 --> 01:22:09,420
He has to have one.

2122
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,520
We're a team.

2123
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,065
Let us do that.

2124
01:22:12,175 --> 01:22:14,065
- Let's fill the boat with fish. - Okay.

2125
01:22:14,605 --> 01:22:18,170
If we catch fish that hasn't been discovered before,

2126
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:19,700
do we get any benefit?

2127
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,375
What if we catch fish that can talk?

2128
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:24,700
- "Hello". - It can talk?

2129
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:26,940
What if it's like, "That hurts".

2130
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,180
"That hurts. Let go."

2131
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,540
"You must be from Seoul."

2132
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,485
If it can speak Korean,

2133
01:22:32,725 --> 01:22:34,510
then you can go home.

2134
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:35,880
Really?

2135
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,560
- Let's do this. - We're done then?

2136
01:22:38,565 --> 01:22:41,220
What if three people fish,

2137
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,265
and one person teach Korean to fish?

2138
01:22:43,735 --> 01:22:44,990
I'll do it.

2139
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,490
(They go off to the ocean to find talking fish.)

2140
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:47,760
There are waves.

2141
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,730
- There are. - It's stronger than I thought.

2142
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:51,005
I know, right?

2143
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,675
Oh, dear.

2144
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:56,345
(Shaking)

2145
01:22:56,745 --> 01:22:58,545
Oh, gosh.

2146
01:22:58,785 --> 01:23:00,815
Don't be startled.

2147
01:23:01,255 --> 01:23:02,540
This happens all the time.

2148
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:03,810
Do you know anything about fishing?

2149
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:05,155
Haven't you gone fishing in the ocean?

2150
01:23:05,595 --> 01:23:07,485
- Do you usually go fishing? - Of course.

2151
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:09,725
I'm the boatman of Mapo-gu.

2152
01:23:10,165 --> 01:23:13,190
All right. This is a good area.

2153
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:14,550
I swear...

2154
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:16,060
that on Haha's camera,

2155
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,420
you'll see him puking the whole time.

2156
01:23:17,420 --> 01:23:18,660
You can only see the water.

2157
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,690
- You'll only see the sky. - I'll look up.

2158
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:22,060
You'll only see the sky.

2159
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:24,860
- Let me show you an example. - Okay.

2160
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,715
In Japan, they fish differently than in Korea.

2161
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:32,370
In Korea, we put the anchor down on both sides and fish in the front.

2162
01:23:32,370 --> 01:23:34,185
In Japan, they say it's dangerous,

2163
01:23:34,715 --> 01:23:38,255
so they put one anchor in the front and fish in the back.

2164
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:41,480
It's different from Korea.

2165
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:43,395
Japan is different from Korea.

2166
01:23:43,495 --> 01:23:44,720
What are you doing?

2167
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:46,425
In Korea,

2168
01:23:46,665 --> 01:23:48,620
we use both sides,

2169
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:50,390
but in Japan, they only use the back because it's dangerous.

2170
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,835
I'm sorry, but are you a parrot?

2171
01:23:52,675 --> 01:23:54,360
- I'm an echo. - You are?

2172
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,530
(They stop 40 minutes into the boat ride.)

2173
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,860
We have no time. Let's get started.

2174
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:59,945
This is the peak time for fishing.

2175
01:24:01,515 --> 01:24:02,945
That looked so cool.

2176
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:06,440
(Like Haha, Sang Yeob looks like an expert too.)

2177
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:09,015
I don't know what I'm supposed to feel.

2178
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:11,315
Hold this,

2179
01:24:11,355 --> 01:24:13,950
and then this hand supports the bottom.

2180
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:15,625
- Okay. - Like this.

2181
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:18,255
I think this is tangled.

2182
01:24:18,295 --> 01:24:19,490
I'll have a look.

2183
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:21,320
(They are three beginners.)

2184
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,595
The tide is so strong.

2185
01:24:23,765 --> 01:24:27,035
(Let the beginners hook baits in the corner.)

2186
01:24:28,505 --> 01:24:29,660
What?

2187
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:31,205
What is it?

2188
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:35,000
(Kwang Soo's fishing rod is doing something funny.)

2189
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,875
- Did you catch something? - You did?

2190
01:24:36,945 --> 01:24:38,215
Hold on.

2191
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:40,670
I think he got it.

2192
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,950
- Kwang Soo! - Really?

2193
01:24:42,955 --> 01:24:44,315
Please.

2194
01:24:45,225 --> 01:24:47,155
Considering the weight,

2195
01:24:47,255 --> 01:24:50,225
the movement, and everything else,

2196
01:24:50,825 --> 01:24:52,965
- You caught something. - this must be smallscale blackfish.

2197
01:25:09,985 --> 01:25:11,915
Considering the weight,

2198
01:25:12,015 --> 01:25:14,985
the movement, and everything else,

2199
01:25:15,585 --> 01:25:17,715
- You caught something. - this must be smallscale blackfish.

2200
01:25:19,425 --> 01:25:21,825
- I caught it! - You did it!

2201
01:25:22,265 --> 01:25:23,450
(Gosh)

2202
01:25:23,450 --> 01:25:24,750
(I caught it!)

2203
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,120
(He's super excited.)

2204
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,420
I caught it!

2205
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,720
- He caught it. - Everybody.

2206
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:31,200
- Thank you. - This is insane.

2207
01:25:31,205 --> 01:25:33,190
This is what I was expecting.

2208
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:35,500
- Kwang Soo. - I'll show you my skills.

2209
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,200
- Kwang Soo. - Goodness.

2210
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,805
What did I say?

2211
01:25:39,145 --> 01:25:40,670
- He caught it. - Everybody,

2212
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:43,375
the anchors go down on both sides in Korea,

2213
01:25:43,585 --> 01:25:45,745
but it goes down the front in Japan.

2214
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:48,070
Despite the difference,

2215
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,140
- What's this? - I...

2216
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:51,950
- It's smallscale blackfish. - I caught smallscale blackfish.

2217
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,320
Good job, Kwang Soo.

2218
01:25:53,325 --> 01:25:54,885
Kwang Soo.

2219
01:25:54,955 --> 01:25:56,520
- You can hold it. - Kwang Soo.

2220
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,025
Everybody, as soon as I started,

2221
01:26:00,295 --> 01:26:01,820
within 10 minutes...

2222
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,420
- Everybody, - Kwang Soo.

2223
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,690
this is a real situation.

2224
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:06,860
Kwang Soo caught smallscale blackfish.

2225
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:08,505
- Yes. - Goodness!

2226
01:26:08,945 --> 01:26:12,005
If it can talk, we can return to Korea.

2227
01:26:12,645 --> 01:26:14,075
Who are you?

2228
01:26:14,445 --> 01:26:15,845
Smallscale blackfish.

2229
01:26:17,215 --> 01:26:19,115
- Smallscale blackfish. - It spoke.

2230
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:20,615
You failed.

2231
01:26:20,815 --> 01:26:22,440
(You should have done it better.)

2232
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,510
Smallscale blackfish.

2233
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:25,750
(The fish can't speak, but they're off to a good start.)

2234
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:26,780
What were you guys going to do without me?

2235
01:26:26,780 --> 01:26:29,050
We only need to catch seven more types of fish.

2236
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,720
Stop showing off.

2237
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:34,190
- I'm going to catch a bigger one. - You're lucky I'm here.

2238
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:35,495
(What were these people going to do without me?)

2239
01:26:36,265 --> 01:26:38,865
I want him to shut his mouth.

2240
01:26:39,305 --> 01:26:41,205
Please, just once.

2241
01:26:41,305 --> 01:26:44,605
Excuse me. I'll take my shirt off. I'm so mad now.

2242
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:48,175
(Annoyed, Haha takes off his top.)

2243
01:26:48,645 --> 01:26:51,110
Haha, you look like you are upset.

2244
01:26:51,115 --> 01:26:53,870
I am not. It's not the mission that's important.

2245
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:55,310
(He is a true fisherman.)

2246
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:56,485
I am a fisherman.

2247
01:26:58,455 --> 01:27:01,580
I will change into a wetsuit.

2248
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:02,880
(At that moment,)

2249
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,195
(Sang Yeob takes Haha's step counter.)

2250
01:27:07,565 --> 01:27:11,135
I was greedy when I was in the entertainment business.

2251
01:27:11,975 --> 01:27:13,760
Please go ahead.

2252
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,935
I will begin once again.

2253
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,175
I will begin...

2254
01:27:18,815 --> 01:27:20,145
as well.

2255
01:27:20,975 --> 01:27:23,475
(He shakes Haha's step counter.)

2256
01:27:24,185 --> 01:27:25,310
Okay.

2257
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:28,415
Haha, you are in my way. Please go someplace else.

2258
01:27:28,625 --> 01:27:30,015
That young man...

2259
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:31,880
- Okay. - Haha.

2260
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:34,310
- Yes? - I am aiming for 1,000 counts.

2261
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:37,350
No, the number isn't important.

2262
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:38,520
- That's right. - Yes.

2263
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,720
Don't you think 5,000 counts would be enough?

2264
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,520
- The number isn't important. - That's right.

2265
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,020
- Focus on enjoying the sea. - That's right.

2266
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:47,790
Throw your hatred, jealousy, and regret...

2267
01:27:47,790 --> 01:27:50,060
into the sea.

2268
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:51,560
I will do that.

2269
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:52,730
That's more than enough.

2270
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:55,345
I want to throw my step counter into the sea.

2271
01:27:55,585 --> 01:27:57,870
- My goodness. - Seriously.

2272
01:27:57,870 --> 01:28:00,210
Such is life. Such is the sea.

2273
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:02,240
- That's right. - Pour out the pent-up anger...

2274
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,510
in your heart.

2275
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:08,310
The sea accepts everything.

2276
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:10,620
(Can you accept this?)

2277
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:12,865
- It's done. - Thank you.

2278
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:16,220
I wish I could tie this to the float.

2279
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,560
(The perfect crime makes him smile.)

2280
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:19,090
(30 minutes pass.)

2281
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:21,535
We just need to focus.

2282
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,800
(How many counts do I have?)

2283
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,475
(Rummaging)

2284
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:31,570
(I know you stole it!)

2285
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,315
(Kwang Soo's eyes meet his.)

2286
01:28:33,555 --> 01:28:35,485
You stole it, right?

2287
01:28:35,955 --> 01:28:37,255
What?

2288
01:28:37,955 --> 01:28:41,350
I can't believe how mean Kwang Soo is.

2289
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,295
Give it back before I kill you.

2290
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:46,150
- It's not me. - Give it back.

2291
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:48,150
- It really isn't me. - Hurry up and give it back.

2292
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,965
Why are you bothering me when I am fishing?

2293
01:28:50,035 --> 01:28:51,930
- What are you doing? - Where is it? Give it back.

2294
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:52,930
I don't have it!

2295
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,930
Where is it? Give it back. I am serious.

2296
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:55,930
I don't have it, you jerk!

2297
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:57,375
(He is falsely accused.)

2298
01:28:57,545 --> 01:28:59,600
(The good brothers exchange words of blessing.)

2299
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,345
Gosh, I felt a bite.

2300
01:29:02,485 --> 01:29:03,945
I don't have it!

2301
01:29:04,915 --> 01:29:06,240
(He feels victimized.)

2302
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,650
I don't have it.

2303
01:29:07,655 --> 01:29:10,180
I can't believe this clown.

2304
01:29:10,180 --> 01:29:11,910
- Why are you fighting? - You jerk!

2305
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,610
What do you think you are doing?

2306
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,950
Why did you steal my step counter?

2307
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:17,320
- What? - Give it back, you jerk.

2308
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:19,595
I don't have it. I don't.

2309
01:29:20,035 --> 01:29:21,395
Come here.

2310
01:29:22,605 --> 01:29:23,865
What is this?

2311
01:29:24,965 --> 01:29:27,905
(Haha's step counter comes out of Kwang Soo's pocket.)

2312
01:29:28,675 --> 01:29:30,400
This is driving me crazy.

2313
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:34,405
It has 2,239 counts.

2314
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:38,240
(Why am I taking a beating?)

2315
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,310
It's not me, you jerk!

2316
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,870
(It's not me, you jerk!)

2317
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:41,940
It's not me!

2318
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,040
(Sang Yeob stole Haha's step counter.)

2319
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:44,980
I am falsely accused!

2320
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:46,125
(How did it come out of Kwang Soo's pocket?)

2321
01:29:47,025 --> 01:29:51,120
(While the two fishermen were fighting...)

2322
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,565
(Slipping)

2323
01:29:53,035 --> 01:29:57,065
(Sang Yeob put the step counter in Kwang Soo's pocket.)

2324
01:29:57,965 --> 01:29:59,790
Was it in Kwang Soo's pocket?

2325
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,060
(Sang Yeob's dazzling improvement)

2326
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,860
Did I do it without even realizing it?

2327
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:04,835
You are less than human.

2328
01:30:04,845 --> 01:30:06,070
Was it in Kwang Soo's pocket?

2329
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:08,505
How could you do this to me?

2330
01:30:09,285 --> 01:30:11,770
Kwang Soo, did you do it without knowing?

2331
01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,385
- I didn't know. - That's scary.

2332
01:30:13,785 --> 01:30:16,355
- Don't you remember? - Don't you remember?

2333
01:30:16,855 --> 01:30:19,425
Do I have a condition? I really didn't do it.

2334
01:30:19,695 --> 01:30:22,180
When did you take it off of me?

2335
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:24,255
It's not me. It really isn't me.

2336
01:30:25,065 --> 01:30:26,765
(It's a midsummer night's dream.)

2337
01:30:27,165 --> 01:30:29,090
(I am happy.)

2338
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,835
(I am with Na Eun.)

2339
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:33,290
Namcha! Namcha! Namcha!

2340
01:30:33,290 --> 01:30:34,435
(Shorry finds happiness as well.)

2341
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:36,230
I want to stay in Bangkok for one more day.

2342
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,230
Jong Kook can leave.

2343
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,435
Are you crazy?

2344
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:40,300
We won't see him after today.

2345
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:42,715
(Jong Kook's suffering begins.)

2346
01:30:42,985 --> 01:30:45,075
(Their battle against the sea continues.)

2347
01:30:45,415 --> 01:30:48,015
(Can they return with a full ship?)

2348
01:30:48,155 --> 01:30:50,510
(Also)

2349
01:30:50,510 --> 01:30:52,810
(The result is shocking.)

2350
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:55,085
(How will Random Tour end?)

2351
01:30:55,695 --> 01:30:56,955
(Coming up)

2352
01:30:57,265 --> 01:30:59,465
(4 mysterious people visit Running Man.)

2353
01:30:59,495 --> 01:31:02,665
(A new project begins with them.)
