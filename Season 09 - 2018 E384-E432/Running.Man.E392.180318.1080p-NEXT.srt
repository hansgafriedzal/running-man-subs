1
00:00:08,945 --> 00:00:10,313
(Last week)

2
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:13,316
(The members ended up at Incheon International Airport.)

3
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:16,219
(What? Global Random Tour?)

4
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:20,890
(No one can predict when and where they will go on their trip.)

5
00:00:21,057 --> 00:00:23,293
You want us to call the guests we want to take on our trip?

6
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:26,296
(It gets worse. They must invite their own travel companions.)

7
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,301
(They boarded the fastest flights available with guests they invited.)

8
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,237
(Three teams head to Daema Island, Thailand, and Okinawa.)

9
00:00:34,237 --> 00:00:37,741
(The rule with step counters makes the mission harder than it is.)

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,676
(The team with the highest, accumulated number will lose.)

11
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:45,415
(1 member from the losing team will pick 1 member to join the penalty.)

12
00:00:45,482 --> 00:00:47,317
That means we shouldn't walk a lot.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,785
(Okinawa)

14
00:00:48,785 --> 00:00:51,821
Discuss among yourselves, and choose a dish you want to eat in Okinawa.

15
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:53,156
- Steak. - Steak.

16
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:56,626
(If a local recommends them steak, their mission is accomplished.)

17
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,395
(I'd like to recommend soba.)

18
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:01,097
(Thus began the curse of soba and ramen.)

19
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:04,567
(Every time they asked, locals recommended them soba or ramen.)

20
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:07,470
(They must eat the recommended dish to try again.)

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,940
(The fetters of noodles look like they can't be broken.)

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,376
(Their flight is at hand. Their last mission is to find a Higa.)

23
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,679
(They managed to find a Higa. What did she recommend?)

24
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,748
(She recommended ramen again.)

25
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:23,720
(They fail their mission, and 1,000 steps are added to their counters.)

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,355
(Daema Island)

27
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,990
We can just eat this?

28
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:31,194
(As soon as they arrived, they got to enjoy a feast of fresh seafood.)

29
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,730
(However,)

30
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,534
(they must catch every type of fish 1 of the members ate.)

31
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:41,738
(Per species they fail to catch, 1,000 steps will be added.)

32
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:45,742
(They set out in the morning to catch 8 types of fish Haha ate.)

33
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:48,645
(Team Love Triangle's morning fishing began at sunrise.)

34
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,247
(Kwang Soo caught a smallscale blackfish.)

35
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,782
You succeeded in catching a smallscale blackfish.

36
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:56,152
(It becomes a battle of pride between Kwang Soo and Haha.)

37
00:01:56,152 --> 00:01:58,388
(Will they be able to catch the rest of 7 species?)

38
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,290
(Thailand)

39
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:03,860
(Team Between Friends will do Thailand's Specialty Tour.)

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,830
(They must spin the globe and accomplish 1 to 4 missions.)

41
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,834
(Every time they fail a mission, 1,000 steps will be added.)

42
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,802
(And they chose 3 missions to do.)

43
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:16,773
(For the first mission, they must beat Sunday in a painting contest.)

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,610
(The result is that Team Between Friends lost by a landslide.)

45
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:23,480
(Since they failed the mission, Shorry gets 1,000 steps.)

46
00:02:24,314 --> 00:02:28,852
(Team Between Friends heads to Bangkok for the second mission.)

47
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,086
- All right. - Yes, Jong Kook.

48
00:02:30,086 --> 00:02:31,688
- We ended up... - It was close.

49
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:32,956
losing by a close margin.

50
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:35,925
- That elephant did so well. - Sunday did an excellent job.

51
00:02:35,925 --> 00:02:38,528
- So we lost. - We can't always win.

52
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:41,030
- That's right. - It's good as long as we had fun.

53
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,399
- That's right. - Missions aren't that important.

54
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,667
- That's right. - Let's complete the last two, okay?

55
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:46,503
- That's right. - We can complete those missions.

56
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:49,305
- Thanks to this show, we get to... - Are we in the army?

57
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,640
- Are we in the army? - spend time...

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,976
He's the drill sergeant, and we are the recruits.

59
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:55,211
- We... - The red cap means he's a sergeant.

60
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:58,648
- We can have similar... - Yes, sir.

61
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,150
- Yes, sir! - numbers on our step counters.

62
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,352
- Yes, sir! - We are in this together, you know.

63
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:04,020
- Yes, sir! - Let's prepare for that.

64
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,022
- Yes, sir. - We have two more missions left.

65
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:08,625
- We will finish the missions, sir. - We should start the missions.

66
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,227
- Let's have fun and finish strong. - Yes, sir.

67
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:13,696
- Yes, sir. - Yes, let's give this a shot.

68
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,599
- First of all, she's waiting. - Okay.

69
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,535
I had no idea that I would get to meet her in Thailand.

70
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:19,669
This is amazing.

71
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,703
(He shouts all of a sudden.)

72
00:03:20,703 --> 00:03:22,939
- I think it was all meant to be. - It's all thanks to you, sir.

73
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,042
- Wait, that sounded too made up. - Hold on.

74
00:03:26,042 --> 00:03:29,112
Hear me out. Who would shout like this when someone talks?

75
00:03:29,112 --> 00:03:31,147
- He's right. He has a point. - "That's great!"

76
00:03:31,147 --> 00:03:33,149
- Come on. Seriously, Shorry. - That was bad, Shorry.

77
00:03:33,149 --> 00:03:34,751
- Honestly, it was terrible. - That was a valid point.

78
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,653
- We can do it again. - You did a good job.

79
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,488
Let's do another take.

80
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:39,789
Let's go and meet her.

81
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:41,257
- Yes! - Yes!

82
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,093
Let's have a jolly, good time!

83
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,163
(Let's have a jolly, good time!)

84
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,867
What was that?

85
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,735
(He is the king of forced reactions.)

86
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,604
How awkward!

87
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:56,840
That was too much.

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,675
"Let's have a jolly, good time!"

89
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,109
(They reminisce about the 90s with an outdated expression.)

90
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,445
(They drive for a long time...)

91
00:04:02,445 --> 00:04:05,682
(and arrive in Bangkok.)

92
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,654
(The location of the second mission, Bangkok Night Market)

93
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:16,459
(It's the number 1 hot place with a view of Chao Phraya River.)

94
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,263
(You can find all kinds of Thai food here.)

95
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:24,367
(It's the center of the culture that includes fashion and rides.)

96
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:27,570
(Can they succeed the mission in the romantic night market?)

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,706
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

98
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:32,242
(They decide to do the mission after dinner.)

99
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:34,310
(There is an array of Thai dishes for Team Between Friends.)

100
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,312
The curry is tasty. Crab curry.

101
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,981
This dish tastes like chicken.

102
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,516
(Tom yum kung, crab curry, and chili Japanese sea bass)

103
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:41,718
Eating food reminds me that I am in Thailand.

104
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,354
We have a guest coming.

105
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:46,723
What's taking our guest so long?

106
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,057
(Food is very tasty,)

107
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,293
(but why isn't the guest coming?)

108
00:04:50,293 --> 00:04:51,494
What's taking our guest so long?

109
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,430
Did you receive a text?

110
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,833
(It's about time.)

111
00:04:59,402 --> 00:05:00,670
The guest is here.

112
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,440
(The guest...)

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,310
- The guest is here. - The guest is here.

114
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,444
(these four men eagerly waited for is...)

115
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:11,447
(Son Na Eun of Apink)

116
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,517
(Son Na Eun, the fairy, appears.)

117
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:19,355
(Na Eun was in Thailand for family vacation.)

118
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:22,625
(She promised to meet at the night market.)

119
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:28,064
(Who knew she would actually come to the night market?)

120
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:29,332
Na Eun!

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,435
(He tidies up his appearance.)

122
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:33,603
Come inside.

123
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:34,904
- Hello. - Na Eun.

124
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:36,639
Your outfit is similar to ours.

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,675
- She is so cute. - Thank you for coming.

126
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,777
- Thank you. - I can't believe this coincidence.

127
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:41,945
I know.

128
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:44,581
We ordered more dishes for you.

129
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:48,084
I am so touched she spared us time during family vacation.

130
00:05:48,084 --> 00:05:49,352
I am so thankful.

131
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:50,620
She is so nice.

132
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,789
Na Eun, eat up. These dishes are delicious.

133
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,324
You will be surprised. These dishes are delicious.

134
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:55,625
I didn't use this fork.

135
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,460
- It's new. - Thank you for the food.

136
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,329
- Try this. - I think it's crab.

137
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:00,863
- That's right. - Crab curry.

138
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,599
- What is it? - I think it will work.

139
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,834
(He is talking about inviting a Thai celebrity.)

140
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:06,102
- Is she coming? - I think she is here.

141
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:07,103
- Where? - Here?

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,738
- I think she is nearby. - Really?

143
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,541
- Should I go and find her? - That's a good idea.

144
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,343
Would it be okay for me to go out?

145
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:15,178
I will be back.

146
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,779
- Do it right. - Okay, Jong Kook.

147
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,215
(It's amazing that their guests are Na Eun and a Thai celebrity.)

148
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,351
Where should I go?

149
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:23,953
I think she is nearby.

150
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,388
(He has to find a Thai celebrity in an unfamiliar night market.)

151
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:27,023
I will keep walking.

152
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:28,291
She has to be here somewhere.

153
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,328
(At Daema Island, Kwang Soo caught smallscale blackfish.)

154
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,563
Kwang Soo.

155
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,998
What else do we have to catch?

156
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:36,766
The rest of you should catch something like squid.

157
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,068
I will take care of the big ones.

158
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,403
I want to catch something.

159
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:41,804
(I really want to catch something.)

160
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,272
I really want to catch something.

161
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,208
This isn't an impossible task.

162
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:46,242
(Kwang Soo patronizes them for 30 minutes.)

163
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:47,477
I will try harder.

164
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:48,845
The thing is,

165
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,880
ships in Korea drops two anchors on the sides...

166
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:53,583
while ships in Japan drops one anchor at the front.

167
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:58,755
"Will I be able to succeed with this different system?"

168
00:06:58,755 --> 00:06:59,989
I was worried at first.

169
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,692
Since I have people watching...

170
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,494
and cameras filming,

171
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,162
I wanted to show what I could do.

172
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,131
Thanks to that pressure,

173
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:10,266
I caught the fish.

174
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,467
That's right.

175
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,136
Please go back to fishing.

176
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,238
I am mad.

177
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,575
I must do this.

178
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:22,712
I keep wasting the bait.

179
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,881
- Relax your left shoulder. - My left shoulder?

180
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:26,849
- Then you will catch fish. - For goodness' sake.

181
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,452
(Kwang Soo doesn't stop spouting nonsense.)

182
00:07:31,054 --> 00:07:33,623
What is going on?

183
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,858
- My goodness. - What is it?

184
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:38,094
- What is it? - What is it?

185
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,296
- That surprised me. - What is this?

186
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:41,998
My goodness, what's going on?

187
00:07:41,998 --> 00:07:43,900
- It's a different species. - Really?

188
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,968
My goodness.

189
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,737
It's a species of fish in the rockfish family, false kelpfish.

190
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,305
- False kelpfish. - False kelpfish.

191
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:51,240
False kelpfish?

192
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,109
- We... - We ate it yesterday.

193
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,877
- We ate it yesterday. - We did.

194
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,479
- I ate it. - My goodness.

195
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,014
This is incredible.

196
00:07:58,014 --> 00:07:59,348
I am sorry,

197
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,250
- but you didn't eat... - We ate it.

198
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,120
I think I ate false kelpfish yesterday.

199
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,788
Don't say that I didn't.

200
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,457
We really ate it.

201
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,058
Congratulations on catching fish,

202
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,127
but false kelpfish isn't one of the species.

203
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,328
(False kelpfish isn't one of the species.)

204
00:08:12,862 --> 00:08:15,732
- It's a baby. - Let it go.

205
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,034
False kelpfish!

206
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:19,936
False kelpfish! False kelpfish!

207
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,139
- False kelpfish! - You caught a cute one.

208
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:25,308
Did you eat?

209
00:08:25,308 --> 00:08:27,844
(He does a voice impression of Jung Woo Sung.)

210
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,579
(He shows his specialty to the false kelpfish.)

211
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,381
You can go, but don't tell your friends that we are here.

212
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,551
(Bye, false kelpfish.)

213
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:38,187
It's gone. It's gone.

214
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,789
I caught one.

215
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,890
(He does a voice impression of Lee Jung Jae.)

216
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,460
(Time passes.)

217
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,000
What is it?

218
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,171
Don't be surprised. Don't mind me.

219
00:08:55,972 --> 00:08:58,441
(People gather around.)

220
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,976
I told you not to mind me.

221
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:01,110
Don't film me.

222
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,111
(He overreacts.)

223
00:09:02,111 --> 00:09:03,146
It's nothing special.

224
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:04,213
(It's nothing special to a professional fisherman.)

225
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,183
Focus on fishing. It's nothing special.

226
00:09:08,317 --> 00:09:10,887
- Kwang Soo. - No way.

227
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,188
It's really big.

228
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:16,292
No way! What is it?

229
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:18,594
(Look at the size.)

230
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:21,030
(What's the second fish Kwang Soo caught?)

231
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,131
It's yellowtail amberjack.

232
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:23,699
(Kwang Soo succeeds in catching yellowtail amberjack.)

233
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:25,134
This is incredible.

234
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:28,604
(Catching yellowtail amberjack adds fuel to Kwang Soo's bragging.)

235
00:09:28,604 --> 00:09:30,907
- Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo! - It's so big.

236
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:35,178
- Everyone, - He is the best fisherman.

237
00:09:35,178 --> 00:09:36,479
be quiet!

238
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,948
- Focus on fishing. - It's really big.

239
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,683
Kwang Soo is the best.

240
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,685
I caught yellowtail amberjack.

241
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:46,289
I caught yellowtail amberjack, the second species on the list!

242
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:47,657
No way.

243
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:50,259
(Thanks to Kwang Soo, they catch 2 out of 8 species.)

244
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:52,328
Everyone,

245
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,397
what did I tell you?

246
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:56,532
I said...

247
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,868
I will show you what I can do.

248
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,002
Everyone,

249
00:10:00,536 --> 00:10:01,704
it's yellowtail amberjack.

250
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:02,939
(Despite a job well-done, he is annoying.)

251
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,474
Everyone, it's yellowtail amberjack.

252
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,043
(It looks like he is asking for people's votes.)

253
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:08,945
(Haha is devastated.)

254
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,079
It's yellowtail amberjack.

255
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,115
(He gets slapped by yellowtail amberjack's tail.)

256
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,585
(It looks like yellowtail amberjack couldn't stand him.)

257
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,620
For goodness' sake.

258
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,256
- He got slapped by fish. - It's yellowtail amberjack.

259
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:22,491
Focus.

260
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,593
(They resume fishing.)

261
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:24,994
We have six more species to catch.

262
00:10:25,928 --> 00:10:28,264
Haha, if you are going to continue fishing like that,

263
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:30,099
you should hand over the camcorder.

264
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:32,602
You are only filming the calm sea.

265
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,370
- My goodness. - If you aren't going to catch fish,

266
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,072
you should hand over the camcorder.

267
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,139
(Discouraged)

268
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,941
From the start, I couldn't understand it.

269
00:10:38,941 --> 00:10:42,478
Why did Haha get the camcorder instead of me?

270
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,746
(That amateur doesn't need a camcorder.)

271
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,149
- Are you looking down on me? - We need a video of the sea.

272
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:49,085
Okay. I won't say more.

273
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,254
In that case,

274
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,655
I hope you get a good video of the sea.

275
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,858
(Discouraged)

276
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,159
How annoying!

277
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,030
In that case...

278
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,400
(Haha takes off the camcorder from his chest.)

279
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:07,436
Should I put it on?

280
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,105
(The camcorder goes to Kwang Soo.)

281
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,373
This is a bit embarrassing.

282
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,842
There wouldn't have been a hassle...

283
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:15,011
had you given it to me from the start.

284
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,948
I feel like it's my own item.

285
00:11:18,948 --> 00:11:20,216
(He is satisfied.)

286
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,652
Please delete the saved video..

287
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:24,353
I am sure it only shows the sea.

288
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:27,123
What comes now is the real deal.

289
00:11:27,123 --> 00:11:29,792
(I am okay. I am okay.)

290
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,494
Okay.

291
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,095
Such is life.

292
00:11:33,095 --> 00:11:34,630
(He learns a lesson.)

293
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:39,502
When Mom goes to the island

294
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:41,304
(I catch life lessons, not fish.)

295
00:11:41,304 --> 00:11:45,408
(Haha stops fishing.)

296
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:50,813
My goodness, I am sorry for being late.

297
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,049
Hello. Hello.

298
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,684
- Aren't you Haha? - Hello.

299
00:11:54,684 --> 00:11:56,152
I am sorry for being late.

300
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:59,055
- Where is my spot? - It's here.

301
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:01,457
Hello, Ji Hyo.

302
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:03,326
- Did you just get here? - Yes.

303
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:06,696
My boat was delayed in Busan.

304
00:12:06,696 --> 00:12:07,830
(That's why I am late.)

305
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,900
You look like the man who got his camcorder taken by me.

306
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,702
Oh, he is my father.

307
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,136
- Is he your father? - Yes.

308
00:12:14,136 --> 00:12:16,272
- I am sorry. - Don't worry about it.

309
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,741
It's your father's camcorder.

310
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:21,243
Since he was bad at fishing, I took it from him.

311
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:22,979
I see. He is a man...

312
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,081
who catches life lessons.

313
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,083
(It looks like Haha left after catching life lessons.)

314
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,684
(Throwing)

315
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:30,886
(The son moves his hands in a fancy way.)

316
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:34,023
You must be an experienced fisherman.

317
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:40,830
(Shouting)

318
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,931
He caught something.

319
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,366
(Is Haha's son getting a bite?)

320
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,868
Are you serious?

321
00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:49,572
(Judging by the fishing rod, it must be big.)

322
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,707
Put it against your stomach.

323
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:54,010
It's too big.

324
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,311
Are you serious?

325
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:56,512
(He is taken aback.)

326
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:59,415
(I am serious, you jerk.)

327
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,183
It's the curse of the camcorder.

328
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,552
Give me back the camcorder.

329
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:05,621
(Kwang Soo's camcorder films Haha's fishing rod.)

330
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:08,124
It's not like that.

331
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,761
Sir, please hold my fishing rod. It's too big.

332
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,696
It's trying to get away.

333
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:15,765
(He acts like his catch is incredibly big.)

334
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:17,133
- That's good. - There is fish.

335
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:19,068
Did I catch a shark?

336
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,170
It's so big.

337
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,039
- Stop, stop. - Hang in there.

338
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,874
I will hang in there.

339
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:26,409
All right.

340
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,443
(Haha's first catch emerges.)

341
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:28,577
You caught it!

342
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:29,645
What is it?

343
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:31,914
- Haha! - Yes, yes.

344
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:34,016
- You caught it. - Yes.

345
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:37,720
(Why did such a big fish get caught?)

346
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,955
Look at that.

347
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,858
It's huge. Isn't it tuna?

348
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:46,495
(Aren't I amazing? He's very satisfied.)

349
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,465
I fish to enjoy myself.

350
00:13:49,465 --> 00:13:50,566
(Kwang Soo is very unhappy.)

351
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:52,334
Look at you.

352
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:53,969
(It's a cute yellowtail amberjack.)

353
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,773
We're fully loaded with fish.

354
00:13:58,307 --> 00:14:00,709
(He celebrates all he ever wanted after catching only one fish.)

355
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,978
Come this way. Let's take a photo.

356
00:14:03,012 --> 00:14:04,280
Come here.

357
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,549
Let's take a photo to commemorate.

358
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:08,918
Come and get in the photo.

359
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:12,188
In 1, 2, 3.

360
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:15,357
- Thank you. - Show the camcorder on Kwang Soo.

361
00:14:15,691 --> 00:14:17,726
(He's very annoyed.)

362
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:20,229
In 1, 2, 3.

363
00:14:20,362 --> 00:14:23,099
(The camcorder's bad luck continues.)

364
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,401
The captain...

365
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,570
is offering the fish that you caught.

366
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,805
- Have some. - Really?

367
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,741
(This is amazing.)

368
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:34,243
Wait, let's help him.

369
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:35,845
With the fish that you caught,

370
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,446
I made sashimi with it.

371
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:38,948
Everyone.

372
00:14:39,181 --> 00:14:40,850
Okay, Kwang Soo.

373
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,319
It looks delicious. I was hungry.

374
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:48,224
(Taste of the sea is impressive.)

375
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:50,860
How is it?

376
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,161
Urban men?

377
00:14:53,729 --> 00:14:54,930
Isn't it delicious?

378
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,899
Yes, I'm sure it is.

379
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,768
- Isn't it delicious? - It's so good.

380
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,070
Help yourself.

381
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,573
Actually, raw fish doesn't have any particular flavor.

382
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,774
However, this is different.

383
00:15:06,308 --> 00:15:08,844
It's a little crunchy.

384
00:15:08,844 --> 00:15:10,379
Right, it's crunchy.

385
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,648
Thank you, captain.

386
00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:15,117
Thank you very much, captain.

387
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:16,619
(They restart to clear the mission.)

388
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,556
- Is this it? - No.

389
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:21,690
I'm sorry.

390
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,058
I'm hallucinating.

391
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,860
(She's so desperate that she hallucinates.)

392
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,062
We have to return the boat,

393
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:30,466
so you'll fish for the next 30 minutes.

394
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,668
Then we'll go back to the port.

395
00:15:32,668 --> 00:15:34,436
The penalty is 1,000 steps.

396
00:15:34,737 --> 00:15:36,572
We have to catch no matter what.

397
00:15:36,672 --> 00:15:37,973
Pull it up.

398
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:39,808
I got it.

399
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:42,378
- Did something get caught? - Yes.

400
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:44,647
- Pull it up. - Ji Hyo.

401
00:15:44,647 --> 00:15:45,981
She got it.

402
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,416
Is this correct?

403
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,051
You're doing well. Just turn it.

404
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:51,320
- Lower it. - Lower it a little and turn it.

405
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,555
Are you hurt?

406
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:54,023
What's that?

407
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:55,724
It's a new type of fish. What is it?

408
00:15:55,724 --> 00:15:57,126
It's a chicken grunt.

409
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,460
Chicken grunt?

410
00:15:58,527 --> 00:15:59,929
She got it.

411
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:02,565
- I caught one. - Great.

412
00:16:02,998 --> 00:16:04,433
- Good job. - I caught one.

413
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,302
- Did we eat it yesterday? - Yes.

414
00:16:06,302 --> 00:16:08,070
We got another type of fish.

415
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,405
That's impressive.

416
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:11,006
You did a good job.

417
00:16:11,106 --> 00:16:13,409
I still caught one fish.

418
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:14,610
- Congratulations. - I caught one.

419
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,978
I got one.

420
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:17,012
Congratulations.

421
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,248
(She does what everyone else does.)

422
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,916
Good job.

423
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,984
(Ji Hyo's fancy debut)

424
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:25,354
We have to return the boat soon.

425
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:27,990
This was your last chance.

426
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,825
We'll go back to the port.

427
00:16:29,825 --> 00:16:31,327
- No. - Good job, everyone.

428
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:33,429
- It's gone. - I can't catch any.

429
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:35,331
(They get additional 5,000 steps.)

430
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:37,499
(It's time to divide the steps.)

431
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:40,102
We have 5,000 steps left.

432
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,570
What will you do?

433
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,872
For everyone to survive, one person takes them all.

434
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:44,873
(Give them to one person.)

435
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:46,375
The rest will be happy.

436
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:48,077
- One person sacrifices? - Let's do that.

437
00:16:48,077 --> 00:16:49,078
That sounds good.

438
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,781
We brought Pirate Roulette Game.

439
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:54,516
(They decide that 1 person will take 5,000 steps.)

440
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,151
Why don't we do this?

441
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,887
Each of us play the game.

442
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:00,256
How many does it take for the pirate to pop?

443
00:17:00,256 --> 00:17:03,092
If the pirate pops after eight stabs, he wins.

444
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,561
If it pops after one time, he loses.

445
00:17:05,561 --> 00:17:07,596
If you survive until the eighth, do you win?

446
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,231
- Yes. - I'll go first.

447
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,399
Go ahead.

448
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,768
(After suggesting the game, Haha plays first.)

449
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:14,770
Here's the first one.

450
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,305
(If it doesn't pop in the beginning, you're likely to win.)

451
00:17:16,305 --> 00:17:17,640
Is that it?

452
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,375
(Haha succeeds 1.)

453
00:17:20,476 --> 00:17:22,077
(Haha succeeds 2.)

454
00:17:22,077 --> 00:17:23,112
Two.

455
00:17:23,112 --> 00:17:25,047
(Please pop next.)

456
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,815
Three.

457
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,250
That's good.

458
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:30,085
Four.

459
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:31,654
He's good.

460
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:32,988
Five. Okay.

461
00:17:32,988 --> 00:17:35,057
(Haha sticks 5 swords already.)

462
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:36,592
- It won't be me. - He's an expert.

463
00:17:36,592 --> 00:17:37,593
Six.

464
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:39,094
(The loser won't be Haha.)

465
00:17:39,128 --> 00:17:40,996
- Seven. Okay. - No way.

466
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:42,498
It'll be the eighth next.

467
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:45,734
Eight. That's crazy. I won't be it.

468
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:47,236
No way.

469
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:49,204
This is crazy.

470
00:17:49,271 --> 00:17:50,606
I can't believe it.

471
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,441
No way.

472
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:54,443
(He doesn't feel lucky today.)

473
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:55,978
I can't believe it.

474
00:17:55,978 --> 00:17:57,980
I got very lucky.

475
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,148
I'll go next.

476
00:17:59,715 --> 00:18:01,183
This is incredible.

477
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:04,086
Gosh, I'm worried. I might lose again.

478
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,654
- Good luck, Ji Hyo. - I can do it.

479
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,591
One.

480
00:18:11,894 --> 00:18:13,095
Two.

481
00:18:13,762 --> 00:18:14,897
Everyone is good.

482
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:16,732
Three.

483
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:19,234
(And so...)

484
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,235
Four.

485
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,104
(She reaches 4.)

486
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,773
- Five. - What's going on?

487
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,744
Six.

488
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:29,945
(She successfully sticks 6.)

489
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:31,880
- Seven. - What's happening?

490
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,148
(Will Ji Hyo reach eight?)

491
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:34,817
(What's going on with the pirate?)

492
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,019
Eight. I'm done.

493
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:38,687
- I'm done. - What's going on?

494
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:40,255
(What kind of situation is this?)

495
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:42,524
(The game seems different.)

496
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:44,293
Ji Hyo.

497
00:18:44,426 --> 00:18:46,662
We're Mapo Siblings.

498
00:18:47,262 --> 00:18:48,497
Go ahead, Kwang Soo.

499
00:18:48,497 --> 00:18:50,599
It's Sang Yeob versus Kwang Soo.

500
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:53,035
Hope that it pops on the first one.

501
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,137
I think it'll pop on his first one.

502
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,540
(Kwang Soo starts carefully.)

503
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,442
(Popping)

504
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:04,213
(What is this?)

505
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:05,547
This is insane.

506
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,616
(It becomes reality.)

507
00:19:07,616 --> 00:19:09,017
Sang Yeob is a prophet.

508
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:12,020
(What's happening is 100-percent real.)

509
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,323
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

510
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:17,526
You're incredibly unlucky.

511
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,895
I can't believe it.

512
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,497
I even got goose bumps.

513
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:24,032
(It's very creepy.)

514
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,534
That's so harsh.

515
00:19:25,534 --> 00:19:26,635
(How do you even live, Kwang Soo?)

516
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:27,703
Where did it go?

517
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,304
Does he win if he succeeds one?

518
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,539
That's right.

519
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:31,974
- He does. - Yes.

520
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,842
- Sang Yeob won't be that unlucky. - No way.

521
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:35,210
- No way. - Don't lie.

522
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,578
Please, please.

523
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:37,713
2, 3.

524
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,683
(The war between Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob ends.)

525
00:19:41,683 --> 00:19:44,553
(Who will get the last laugh?)

526
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,022
There we go.

527
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:48,390
(He smiles.)

528
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:49,892
(Kwang Soo gets 5,000 steps.)

529
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,093
Shall I do one more?

530
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,629
- There we go. - That's right.

531
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,564
Here I go again.

532
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,500
- Did you think it'd pop? - That's right.

533
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,302
It's working so well.

534
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:01,837
- He has one left. - It's working.

535
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:04,006
- There we go. - Is it the last one?

536
00:20:04,006 --> 00:20:05,207
It popped.

537
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:07,075
I'm still talented, aren't I?

538
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,510
(He considers himself talented.)

539
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,379
What have you done for the last two days?

540
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:13,415
Kwang Soo gets 5,000 additional steps.

541
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:14,650
That's amazing.

542
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,918
(Kwang Soo reaches 14,000 steps.)

543
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:17,486
It's over 10,000.

544
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,822
How did Kwang Soo...

545
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:21,523
- lose on the first one? - That's so unlucky.

546
00:20:21,523 --> 00:20:23,392
- I couldn't believe it. - Me neither.

547
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,526
It's so stressful.

548
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:27,463
Let me say this.

549
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:29,731
I have nothing to fear. I know that I'll be last.

550
00:20:29,865 --> 00:20:32,000
I'll steal yours and shake them.

551
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,268
You can take mine too.

552
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,804
I'll just steal one of yours...

553
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,339
and shake it.

554
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:39,475
Fine, shake it.

555
00:20:39,475 --> 00:20:41,109
- I won't. - Shake it.

556
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:42,744
- Okay. - Shake it.

557
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,247
My goodness.

558
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,648
(Which place will Team Love Triangle be?)

559
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,686
Namcha, Namcha.

560
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,788
Namcha.

561
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,324
(Where are you?)

562
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:56,425
Where is she?

563
00:21:01,797 --> 00:21:03,966
(There's someone.)

564
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:07,302
(The person he waited for...)

565
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:08,604
Namcha.

566
00:21:08,604 --> 00:21:10,739
(The person he waited for is Namcha.)

567
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,041
Hello, I'm Namcha from Thailand.

568
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,644
(She worked with Shorry in Thailand.)

569
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:19,414
(Namcha is popular in Thailand.)

570
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:21,817
- Here's Namcha. - Here comes Namcha.

571
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:22,951
(A real Thai celebrity comes.)

572
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,020
- Welcome. - Hello.

573
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,122
- It's nice to meet you. - She's here.

574
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:29,758
- Our Thai celebrity is here. - She's here.

575
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:32,694
(She's really here this time.)

576
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,162
Please introduce yourself.

577
00:21:34,496 --> 00:21:36,732
My name is Namcha. It's nice meeting you.

578
00:21:38,433 --> 00:21:39,568
Welcome.

579
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:42,137
She's a famous actor in Thailand.

580
00:21:42,137 --> 00:21:43,605
- It's actress. - Yes?

581
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,608
- You used to be a singer, right? - Yes.

582
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:48,510
She sings and acts.

583
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,012
She's done both.

584
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:53,415
I act, and I still sing.

585
00:21:53,415 --> 00:21:56,585
I also work in cosmetics. I sell them.

586
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,854
- She also sells cosmetics. - Cosmetics.

587
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:01,356
- I do fashion shows... - Fashion shows?

588
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:03,191
in Asia.

589
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,960
- She does everything. - Usually in Asia.

590
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,229
- She's multi-talented. - She does everything.

591
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:08,564
You're a multi-talented entertainer.

592
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:10,032
- That's right. - Like Lim Chang Jung.

593
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:11,266
Lim Chang Jung?

594
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:12,501
Thank you.

595
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,603
- Lim Chang Jung? - Thank you.

596
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,238
Do you know Running Man?

597
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,773
Yes.

598
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,209
Do you know who he is?

599
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:24,079
(Do you know who I am?)

600
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,649
I... I never watched it before.

601
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:28,850
- Sorry. - That's okay.

602
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,353
(I've never seen him.)

603
00:22:31,353 --> 00:22:33,755
- That's okay. - I've been on TV a lot.

604
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:35,123
That's okay.

605
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:38,594
He's a new member on Running Man.

606
00:22:38,594 --> 00:22:41,029
- He's... - I'm part of YG.

607
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,197
YG?

608
00:22:42,197 --> 00:22:43,832
YG Entertainment.

609
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,901
He's not important anymore.

610
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:48,303
- He's a lost card. - I'm the kitchen maid.

611
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:50,772
- He's a kitchen maid. - What are we doing?

612
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:53,108
As we mentioned before,

613
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:55,777
you'll give a present to the Thai celebrity.

614
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,279
- Right. - That's your mission.

615
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,880
At this night market,

616
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:02,718
buy five of these snacks.

617
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:03,852
Do we buy them?

618
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,587
We have to buy specific ones.

619
00:23:05,587 --> 00:23:06,989
Will we eat them?

620
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:08,457
Why don't we...

621
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:10,359
(What? Taktaen?)

622
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,526
Taktaen.

623
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:12,728
How do you read it?

624
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:14,930
(There are five snacks written in Thai.)

625
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,264
- Do you understand? - There's kob.

626
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:18,033
What's kob?

627
00:23:18,033 --> 00:23:19,768
- Do we buy them out there? - Yes.

628
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:22,304
I should be with Namcha.

629
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,374
The locals can't help you with the mission.

630
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:26,875
You should go.

631
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:28,276
I'll buy her a present.

632
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,878
Will you be staying here?

633
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:31,213
Yes.

634
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:33,015
That means...

635
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:35,317
your step counter won't move.

636
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,885
Mine is too high.

637
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:39,087
- Why don't you switch... - Why don't you switch...

638
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:40,989
- I'll take yours. - Switch yours.

639
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:42,324
(I'll take your step counter.)

640
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:44,693
- Switch. - I'll leave mine here.

641
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:45,994
Okay.

642
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,295
Let's do it.

643
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:49,297
- It doesn't matter. - Are you feeling all right?

644
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,066
I'm sorry, but how high is yours?

645
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,834
- 12,000. - 12,000?

646
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,770
You better not take more than a thousand steps.

647
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,571
(You better not take more than a thousand steps.)

648
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:57,706
What exactly does that mean?

649
00:23:57,706 --> 00:23:59,441
- A thousand steps... - What do you think it means?

650
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:01,510
- Please explain. - He'll hit you.

651
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,812
With every additional step, he'll hit you once.

652
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,281
Let's hurry.

653
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:07,716
- Hurry. - We'll get going.

654
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,451
- Let's go. - Let's go.

655
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,786
- Na Eun, we're sorry. - We're sorry.

656
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,054
See you.

657
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,355
- Let's go. - Are you okay?

658
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:14,556
Where are they going?

659
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:18,393
These two guys are going to buy some stuff for you.

660
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,162
Why are you not going?

661
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:24,266
I should take care of you.

662
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:28,370
(Will the guys be able to complete their mission without Jong Kook?)

663
00:24:29,104 --> 00:24:30,672
Where should we go?

664
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:34,476
First, let's find a place where they sell gifts.

665
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,111
But we don't speak Thai.

666
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,547
We'll just use gestures.

667
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:41,183
This way...

668
00:24:42,217 --> 00:24:44,853
(Shaking)

669
00:24:46,488 --> 00:24:48,523
(Constantly)

670
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:53,528
What gift should we get?

671
00:24:53,695 --> 00:24:57,599
Let's find something a girl would like.

672
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,035
(Namcha is Thailand's fashion leader.)

673
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:01,036
(Where could they find something she would like?)

674
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,772
Namcha is in fashion business.

675
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,341
She must be picky.

676
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:08,944
All right.

677
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:11,046
Where should we go?

678
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,483
Thank you so much.

679
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:15,951
I'll...

680
00:25:16,718 --> 00:25:18,286
definitely make it up to you.

681
00:25:18,286 --> 00:25:19,688
How?

682
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:22,958
- I'll get you a gift or something. - I see.

683
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:24,659
- I have to. - I'm okay.

684
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:26,895
- I insist. - I came for Running Man.

685
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:28,463
Exactly. You're amazing.

686
00:25:28,964 --> 00:25:30,265
I love Bangkok.

687
00:25:30,265 --> 00:25:31,366
(I'm happy to be here with you.)

688
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,635
I love Bangkok too.

689
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,270
(I love Bangkok too.)

690
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:37,973
(We're in Bangkok, far away from home.)

691
00:25:37,973 --> 00:25:39,574
Who would believe this?

692
00:25:39,574 --> 00:25:41,376
(I can't believe I'm walking with you.)

693
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,712
I'm so happy.

694
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,148
I don't care if our mission fails.

695
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,250
(Forget about the mission.)

696
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,652
- It's fun! - It's fun!

697
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:52,354
It's very fun.

698
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:53,655
(They're raising Jong Kook's step count.)

699
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:56,858
(In the zone)

700
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:00,295
(Hold on.)

701
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:01,363
Kim Jong Kook.

702
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:03,064
(Is this real?)

703
00:26:03,598 --> 00:26:05,433
Die, Jong Kook!

704
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,803
Bye, Jong Kook!

705
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:10,038
(While the two immature guys are shaking Jong Kook's step counter...)

706
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:14,442
I don't think it'll take that long. The night market...

707
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:17,412
(Se Chan and Na Eun are looking for snack stalls.)

708
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,549
It's there.

709
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,152
We have to complete our mission too.

710
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:26,621
That's right. Let's go to the night market.

711
00:26:28,957 --> 00:26:30,091
Can you speak Thai?

712
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,227
- I can count. - Really?

713
00:26:32,794 --> 00:26:37,866
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

714
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,401
- You're good. - Se Chan!

715
00:26:39,401 --> 00:26:40,402
Se Chan!

716
00:26:40,402 --> 00:26:42,504
- He can't hear us. - Na Eun!

717
00:26:42,838 --> 00:26:43,972
Na Eun!

718
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:45,941
Let us join you.

719
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:48,109
- Did you buy something? - Did you buy something?

720
00:26:48,743 --> 00:26:50,145
We're going to complete the mission now.

721
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:51,746
- You're not done yet? - You're starting now?

722
00:26:51,746 --> 00:26:53,281
Can we join you?

723
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:54,883
Let's go together.

724
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:56,084
All right.

725
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:57,085
(They check the first stall.)

726
00:26:57,085 --> 00:26:58,320
Let's check this place out.

727
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:00,088
What's that?

728
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:04,492
(Hold on.)

729
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,695
(What are these?)

730
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,598
(Thailand's specialties)

731
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:10,632
(Interesting food)

732
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:11,700
What's that?

733
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,002
(What are those?)

734
00:27:14,002 --> 00:27:15,337
- What's that? - What's that?

735
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:16,404
(Scorpions?)

736
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:21,076
- Are they scorpions? - Should we ask them?

737
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:24,079
(Hopefully,)

738
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,450
(we won't find our mission snacks here.)

739
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:33,488
(Do you have...)

740
00:27:33,488 --> 00:27:37,592
(kob?)

741
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:40,395
(Please say no.)

742
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:41,763
- Kob? - Kob.

743
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:43,732
Here.

744
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:44,733
- It's frog. - Frogs?

745
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:45,901
(It's frog.)

746
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:50,372
(Frogs?)

747
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:52,240
- It's frog? - It's frog?

748
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,944
(Screaming)

749
00:27:56,278 --> 00:27:57,345
What was that?

750
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,414
(Gosh, you startled me.)

751
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:01,549
(I got you.)

752
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,951
Gosh.

753
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,854
- Come on. - You startled me.

754
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:07,589
Come on.

755
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:10,091
Gosh, you startled me.

756
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:13,028
"Kob" means frog?

757
00:28:13,295 --> 00:28:15,497
Let's ask about other things too.

758
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:18,667
- Cinghrid. - Cinghrid.

759
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:21,803
(Do you have...)

760
00:28:21,803 --> 00:28:25,006
(cinghrid too?)

761
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,309
(Here)

762
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:29,878
- Are they cockroaches? - Crickets.

763
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,379
- They're crickets. - Are they grasshoppers?

764
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,380
I'm starting to sweat.

765
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,949
- Do you have taktaen too? - Taktaen...

766
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:35,750
Here.

767
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,752
- They're grasshoppers. - They're grasshoppers.

768
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:39,387
- Ask about that one. - Nun turek?

769
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:40,755
(Do they have nun turek too?)

770
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,290
(Fried larvae)

771
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,093
- It's larvae. - Right.

772
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:47,729
- What is mengpong? - Mengpong?

773
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:52,901
(What is the last one, mengpong?)

774
00:28:52,901 --> 00:28:55,904
Scorpion.

775
00:28:56,304 --> 00:28:59,741
(The appearance makes them nervous.)

776
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:01,743
That's so big.

777
00:29:01,743 --> 00:29:04,245
We have to eat them, right?

778
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,347
Are we going to eat them?

779
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,683
Each snack has to be tried by at least one member.

780
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:12,520
(Just one member?)

781
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,789
(It should be...)

782
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,024
How mad are you?

783
00:29:16,024 --> 00:29:18,193
(The one guy who is not here.)

784
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,995
I really hate that kind of...

785
00:29:20,128 --> 00:29:21,262
I think...

786
00:29:22,297 --> 00:29:24,199
Should we give them to Jong Kook?

787
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,533
(Should we give them to Jong Kook?)

788
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,003
This is our chance.

789
00:29:28,003 --> 00:29:29,170
Yes.

790
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,673
- Let's kill Jong Kook. - It doesn't taste good.

791
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:32,674
(Poison is removed.)

792
00:29:32,674 --> 00:29:34,275
Of course.

793
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,878
- What is he doing? - He removed the poison.

794
00:29:36,878 --> 00:29:38,279
He removed it now?

795
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,647
What if he forgot?

796
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,282
He just removed it before our eyes?

797
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,784
- Okay. - Thank you.

798
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,652
- Thank you. - Bye.

799
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:45,887
(Will they succeed in making Jong Kook eat them?)

800
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:46,988
- Let's go. - Bye.

801
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:48,690
(Will they succeed in making Jong Kook eat them?)

802
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,958
We're back.

803
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,993
(Team Between Friends comes back after completing the mission.)

804
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,695
- Did everything go well? - Yes.

805
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,296
I see. What did you buy?

806
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,731
- It went well. - Did it go well?

807
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,601
Can I check my step counter?

808
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,536
Give it to me.

809
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:04,973
- I think... - I haven't checked it myself yet.

810
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:07,242
- Didn't you run around? - No.

811
00:30:07,242 --> 00:30:10,078
- He didn't... - He was running around a lot.

812
00:30:11,012 --> 00:30:14,149
Why did you run around?

813
00:30:14,149 --> 00:30:15,283
I didn't.

814
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,788
(The video didn't freeze.)

815
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:22,090
- What's wrong? - What's wrong?

816
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,158
How high is it?

817
00:30:23,158 --> 00:30:25,193
- It's over 13,000. - What?

818
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:30,365
The thing is, I met a pickpocket.

819
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:33,768
- I had to chase him. - That sounds so fake.

820
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:34,803
That sounds really fake.

821
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:36,571
- It went up a lot. - Give it.

822
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:37,572
- I'm sorry. - Give it to me.

823
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:38,973
- I'll take mine back now. - Give it back.

824
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,508
Give it to me.

825
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:41,843
(Give me your step counter.)

826
00:30:42,677 --> 00:30:45,980
(Jong Kook is trying to switch the name stickers.)

827
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,882
This is not okay.

828
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,184
- He can't do this. - Why not?

829
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,985
Someone please tell him.

830
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,320
Look at this.

831
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:54,823
- He dug his own grave. - It's over 13,000.

832
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:55,890
Seriously...

833
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,726
He can't do this. Explain the rules to him.

834
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,395
It was too obvious.

835
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:01,796
It was too unnatural.

836
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:03,731
- It was. - It was unnatural.

837
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,633
Team Thailand,

838
00:31:05,633 --> 00:31:07,602
let's check your mission result.

839
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:09,504
Seriously...

840
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:13,441
We couldn't only buy something for Namcha.

841
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:16,544
- We got something for Na Eun too. - Na Eun too.

842
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:18,813
Here you go.

843
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:20,081
What is it?

844
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,783
It's big.

845
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:23,184
- And... - It looks big.

846
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:25,086
- Namcha. - Is it a hat?

847
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:27,722
- Yes. - It's a hat.

848
00:31:28,123 --> 00:31:29,457
It's pretty.

849
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:31,793
Look at Na Eun.

850
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:32,894
Isn't the color so pretty?

851
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:34,529
It's so pretty.

852
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,097
The colors suit them well.

853
00:31:36,097 --> 00:31:37,232
You made the right choice.

854
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,467
- You look great. - You guys have a good eye.

855
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,668
Your second mission has been completed.

856
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:43,071
- Yes! - Yes!

857
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,006
We did it.

858
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:48,176
You went to the night market for the third mission.

859
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:49,811
You were supposed to buy snacks.

860
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:51,279
First...

861
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,647
(Frogs)

862
00:31:52,647 --> 00:31:54,349
- It's a frog. - It's a frog.

863
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,651
- Did you eat it? - It's a whole frog.

864
00:31:56,651 --> 00:31:58,286
We all tried it.

865
00:31:58,286 --> 00:31:59,754
The legs are so far apart.

866
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:01,089
(We all tried it.)

867
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,594
(Only one member has to try it.)

868
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,730
(Jong Kook doesn't know this rule.)

869
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,900
(The others want to deceive him.)

870
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:13,735
- It's an appetizer. - It's an appetizer.

871
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,136
Can I just try the leg?

872
00:32:15,136 --> 00:32:17,238
- No. - Eat the body too.

873
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:19,440
It tastes so good that you'll want to eat the body too.

874
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,076
It tasted like dried filefish.

875
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,179
- Cinghrid. - Cinghrid.

876
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,613
(Crickets)

877
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,615
I can eat it. It's no problem.

878
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:30,985
I ate them a lot when I was little.

879
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,253
Can you eat it now too?

880
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,189
- I ate it. - Okay.

881
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:36,491
- This one. - It's a grasshopper.

882
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,393
You have to eat it in a certain way.

883
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:39,527
I can't eat that.

884
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,662
(I can't eat that.)

885
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:42,697
You can't eat that?

886
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:44,132
- Did you eat it or not? - I did.

887
00:32:44,132 --> 00:32:46,568
- Then why did you say that? - I mean, I can't eat anymore.

888
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:49,504
Look at this. I'll remove the legs.

889
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:50,538
Hold on.

890
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:51,773
- I'm removing the legs. - Remove the legs.

891
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,041
I know how to eat it.

892
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,776
You have to remove the legs.

893
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:55,777
The vendor taught us.

894
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:58,680
I might remove your legs.

895
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,249
I hope you're joking.

896
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:02,350
Jong Kook.

897
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,085
- Did you eat it or not? - I did.

898
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,587
- You did? - Yes.

899
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:07,622
- Do you know where Byung Jae lives? - Yes.

900
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:09,257
(Do you know where Byung Jae lives?)

901
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:12,427
I'll come to you.

902
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,828
I'm not joking.

903
00:33:13,828 --> 00:33:16,664
I'll come to you. I'm not joking.

904
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:17,899
Give me one.

905
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:20,935
Eat it.

906
00:33:20,935 --> 00:33:22,737
Put one in your mouth.

907
00:33:23,104 --> 00:33:24,872
- The same one. - I can't let him come to my place.

908
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:27,041
Gosh, why is it so big?

909
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,643
It looks like a cicada.

910
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:31,246
Let's show our viewers.

911
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,248
- Hold it. - It's your punishment.

912
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:34,349
I can't.

913
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:36,584
- You have to eat it now. - Come on. Seriously.

914
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,486
This is why you should never lie.

915
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:39,621
My goodness, Jong Kook.

916
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:41,155
- He's good at eating these. - Hey.

917
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,957
(Jong Kook and Byung Jae both eat crickets.)

918
00:33:42,991 --> 00:33:45,627
You must chew the innards and swallow.

919
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:47,328
- They eat all of it. - Isn't it good?

920
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:49,264
- This is delicious. - I told you it's good.

921
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:50,665
It's seasoned. It's really good.

922
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:52,333
- It's nutty. - And...

923
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,935
the last snack,

924
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:55,737
- the scorpion. - The scorpion. Okay.

925
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,038
(The fifth snack is the scorpion.)

926
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,207
Na Eun, you should give that to Jong Kook.

927
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:00,842
Why are you giving that to me?

928
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:02,977
- We got rid of the venom gland. - Did everyone eat this too?

929
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,245
We removed the venom gland.

930
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,447
- The venom gland is on its back. - Okay.

931
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:08,016
- The owner removed it. - So answer this.

932
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,717
We said that it was for you, and Byung Jae told him...

933
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:11,352
- to keep the venom gland. - Why did you say that?

934
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,520
(Se Chan is misleading again.)

935
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,888
- Fine. I said that. - This one has the venom gland.

936
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,923
Fine. I said that.

937
00:34:16,958 --> 00:34:19,260
- I said that. So what? - He said, "So what?"

938
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,829
- I won't ever see you again now. - You...

939
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:24,032
- You won't ever see me again? - No, I didn't mean that.

940
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:25,833
I was joking. I lied.

941
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:28,569
Hey, you guys didn't eat this, right?

942
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:29,971
We should all share this then.

943
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:32,707
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Only one of us will eat it.

944
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:34,108
Do we have anything we can play draw of luck?

945
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:37,111
(The last snack, the scorpion, will determine the result.)

946
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:39,647
- The last snack, the scorpion. - The scorpion.

947
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:42,150
(A roulette board with everyone's names is presented.)

948
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,086
Just remember. This is food.

949
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,622
- This is for the snack. - It's for the snack.

950
00:34:47,622 --> 00:34:49,957
- Get ready. - You can spin it here like this.

951
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,826
(Namcha's spin will determine which member will taste the snack.)

952
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,494
- Good, good. - That was a good spin.

953
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:58,833
(Which one of them will get to taste the scorpion?)

954
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,035
- We'll decide with this. - This will determine the member.

955
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,305
(Byung Jae)

956
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:07,608
(Byung Jae is chosen.)

957
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,644
(Oh, no. I'm doomed.)

958
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:12,380
(Congratulations, Byung Jae.)

959
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:17,819
(Mom,)

960
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:21,456
(I miss you.)

961
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:22,857
How much of this can I eat?

962
00:35:22,857 --> 00:35:24,726
I see its head. Didn't you remove the head?

963
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:26,394
- There was a way to remove it. - Where did it go?

964
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:28,563
The guy removed it and gave it to us.

965
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:29,831
- It's on the back. - My gosh.

966
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,933
(Hold on.)

967
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,202
How can I eat this if the local guide can't even remove it?

968
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:36,003
The local guide seems scared. How could we...

969
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:40,508
(He's terrified.)

970
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:43,111
- You can eat it now. - The guide was so surprised.

971
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,012
He was really surprised, wasn't he?

972
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,314
- How do I know if you did it? - I mean...

973
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:48,216
The local coordinator was scared too.

974
00:35:48,216 --> 00:35:50,218
How could you tell us to eat this?

975
00:35:50,218 --> 00:35:52,286
- Let's do it! - Let's do it!

976
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,155
1 bite. 1 bite.

977
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:56,457
(He takes a big bite.)

978
00:35:56,457 --> 00:35:58,526
(He's chewing.)

979
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,828
(My gosh, Byung Jae is so brave.)

980
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,663
- Don't eat the tail. - It's edible. It's good.

981
00:36:02,663 --> 00:36:04,065
- It's good. - I'm sure it's good.

982
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:05,333
Did we accomplish the mission then?

983
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,335
You accomplished the third mission.

984
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:08,669
(Team Between Friends completes the third mission too.)

985
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:12,173
(They finish all of their missions.)

986
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:14,108
- Hello. - Hello.

987
00:36:14,108 --> 00:36:15,576
I feel like I haven't seen you in so long.

988
00:36:15,576 --> 00:36:17,378
All right. Everyone returned safely after the mission,

989
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:19,781
Departure upon Arrival for Global Random Tour.

990
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:21,082
Well done, everyone.

991
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,350
(They will find out who will face the penalty now.)

992
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,651
You guys do work so hard.

993
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:26,487
- We'll tell you the final penalty. - Okay.

994
00:36:26,487 --> 00:36:29,657
For the final penalty, you must fish in the indoor dome.

995
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,561
For the final penalty, you must fish in the indoor dome.

996
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:35,096
- It's fishing again? - What's an indoor dome?

997
00:36:35,096 --> 00:36:36,431
We just came back from fishing.

998
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,533
For the penalty, you will go fishing at night...

999
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:41,335
and continue to fish until you catch one.

1000
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:43,838
A member from the losing team will face the penalty.

1001
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,541
The member will choose another member to join the penalty.

1002
00:36:47,008 --> 00:36:50,311
However, the member with the least number of steps in each team...

1003
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:53,014
will be completely exempted from being chosen.

1004
00:36:54,148 --> 00:36:56,350
Now, we will reveal the accumulated steps from each team.

1005
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,419
- I'll announce the losing team. - Okay.

1006
00:36:58,419 --> 00:36:59,754
First, Team Daema Island.

1007
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:01,255
The total number of steps...

1008
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:02,523
- My gosh. - How many did we have?

1009
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:06,227
- It's 31,992 steps. - You were so nice to each other.

1010
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:08,196
- 30,000? - Only 31,000?

1011
00:37:08,196 --> 00:37:09,797
- It was only 31,000? - Why do you say that?

1012
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,232
- That's a lot. - Only 31,000?

1013
00:37:11,232 --> 00:37:13,401
- That's not that many. - Really?

1014
00:37:13,401 --> 00:37:14,836
I guess we didn't come last.

1015
00:37:14,836 --> 00:37:17,505
- We might be able to win. - We might not be last.

1016
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:18,673
Team Thailand.

1017
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:19,740
- Team Thailand. - Team Thailand.

1018
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,209
The total number of steps is...

1019
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:24,479
- 56,069. - That's a lot.

1020
00:37:24,479 --> 00:37:26,547
- That's our number? - We had that many steps?

1021
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:27,882
- Seriously? - Hey, we're not last.

1022
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,383
How is that even possible?

1023
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:33,054
If Team Okinawa's total number of steps is less than Team Thailand,

1024
00:37:33,054 --> 00:37:34,722
- Team Thailand will do the penalty. - Okay.

1025
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,357
But we walked a lot.

1026
00:37:36,357 --> 00:37:38,559
- My legs hurt so much. - A member in the team will face it.

1027
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,496
Team Okinawa's total number of steps is...

1028
00:37:41,496 --> 00:37:45,032
(Team Between Friends will take last place if it's less than 56,069.)

1029
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:48,035
- The total number of steps is 5... - 5.

1030
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:49,670
- We walked that many steps? - Please don't let it be 56,000.

1031
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,739
- Please say 7. 7. He will say 7. - 7. 7.

1032
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:52,974
7. 7.

1033
00:37:52,974 --> 00:37:54,375
54,557.

1034
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,944
(Team Okinawa's total number of steps is 54,557.)

1035
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:58,913
- Yes! - Are we second?

1036
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:02,650
(Team Between Friends comes last with the difference of 1,500.)

1037
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:07,555
Hey, when you went out and shook my step counter,

1038
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,123
didn't it increase about 2,000 steps?

1039
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:11,225
- That was 3,000. He did that. - It was 3,000.

1040
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:13,160
We lost because you added 3,000 steps.

1041
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:16,297
Jong Kook, he's my friend. I invited him onto our show.

1042
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,932
- I didn't mean to. - He took mine.

1043
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,800
He shook my step counter.

1044
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,236
I didn't know I had Little Kwang Soo in our team.

1045
00:38:22,336 --> 00:38:24,005
- He was shopping. - My goodness.

1046
00:38:24,005 --> 00:38:25,206
He held Jong Kook's and said, "What should I buy?"

1047
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:26,841
How did you not know?

1048
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,877
- It's because I had to stay inside. - He was inside.

1049
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:33,648
I know where you live.

1050
00:38:33,648 --> 00:38:35,316
(He's terrified.)

1051
00:38:35,316 --> 00:38:37,051
- He knows the home address? - He might really visit you.

1052
00:38:37,051 --> 00:38:39,320
- He follows through on his words. - If Jong Kook knows his address,

1053
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,588
they are best friends then.

1054
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,990
A member from Team Thailand will be chosen for the penalty.

1055
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:45,760
We will announce member who will be exempted from the penalty first.

1056
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,895
- My goodness. - Team Okinawa.

1057
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,131
So Min with 9,900 steps is exempted.

1058
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:52,166
(So Min is exempted from the penalty.)

1059
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,001
Team Daema Island.

1060
00:38:54,502 --> 00:38:57,071
- Ji Hyo with 3,686 is exempted. - Yes!

1061
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:58,372
- 3,000? - Only 3,000 steps?

1062
00:38:58,372 --> 00:39:00,441
- Ji Hyo didn't walk at all. - Did you only lie down?

1063
00:39:00,441 --> 00:39:02,710
- Did she lie down the whole time? - My calf muscles are sore...

1064
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,613
- from walking like this. Seriously. - Why do we have such a high number?

1065
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:07,782
This is how I walked all day.

1066
00:39:07,782 --> 00:39:10,451
A member from Team Thailand will be exempted from the penalty.

1067
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:11,586
(1st place from the team will be announced.)

1068
00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:13,354
With 11,755 steps,

1069
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:14,589
- Se Chan will be exempted. - Okay!

1070
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,390
Friends? Dream on, punks!

1071
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,758
(He undergoes a sudden change.)

1072
00:39:17,758 --> 00:39:19,193
Friends? Dream on, punks!

1073
00:39:19,193 --> 00:39:21,228
(Their friendship is shattered.)

1074
00:39:24,298 --> 00:39:25,933
How could someone with 12,000 steps win 1st place?

1075
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:29,303
Se Chan, you only live for today.

1076
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:32,340
Jong Kook. Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

1077
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,343
- Is today your last day? - No, that's not it.

1078
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,712
- Good work. Let's get dinner. - No, no.

1079
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:39,780
- Are we having a farewell party? - Sure.

1080
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,016
- I'll do it. - What kind of family are you?

1081
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:43,684
- What kind of... - No, we are friends.

1082
00:39:43,684 --> 00:39:45,319
- You are friends? - We're old friends.

1083
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,955
I will announce the member with the highest steps.

1084
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:52,493
13,434 steps.

1085
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:53,628
13,000 steps?

1086
00:39:53,628 --> 00:39:56,030
It's yours, Byung Jae.

1087
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,698
Yours isn't the highest.

1088
00:39:57,698 --> 00:39:59,033
- My gosh. - Really?

1089
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,968
- Yours wasn't the highest. - No way.

1090
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,737
- You... - I thought it'd be me.

1091
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,105
- I thought so too. - That wasn't the highest?

1092
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:08,109
Remaining numbers are 15,201 and 15,679.

1093
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:10,044
- 15,679... - Jong Kook, hold on.

1094
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:13,547
The member with the highest number of steps, 15,679...

1095
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:17,485
(Shorry lost to Sunday in the painting contest.)

1096
00:40:17,485 --> 00:40:20,388
(He volunteered to take 1,000 steps to take the responsibility.)

1097
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,024
(Byung Jae took Jong Kook's step counter for a while.)

1098
00:40:23,024 --> 00:40:26,160
(3,000 steps were added thanks to Byung Jae.)

1099
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,796
(Which one of them will have the highest number?)

1100
00:40:28,796 --> 00:40:29,797
Jong Kook? Is it Jong Kook?

1101
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:31,232
- It's Shorry. - Yes!

1102
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,167
(Shorry has the highest number.)

1103
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:35,636
Shorry's number is the highest?

1104
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,605
You must have done a lot of errands for Jong Kook.

1105
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,840
- Errands? - He must've done a lot of them.

1106
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,543
- You said we were in this together! - Hold on.

1107
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:44,345
But isn't Shorry going to pick someone?

1108
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:46,247
- I can't believe you guys. - Shorry, you will need to pick.

1109
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:49,050
Shorry, you can choose a member who will join you...

1110
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,185
to fish in the indoor dome.

1111
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:52,253
Is that so?

1112
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:54,889
- I can choose a member? - Yes, you can.

1113
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,923
- Really? - We already discussed this.

1114
00:40:55,923 --> 00:40:58,125
Since we are very good friends,

1115
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,729
we promised each other that we wouldn't choose each other.

1116
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:02,963
- We did? - We made a promise.

1117
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,299
- Yes, we did. - We made a promise?

1118
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,768
- I made a promise like that? - Yes, we made a promise.

1119
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:10,271
- I made a promise? - I have a shoot at 9am tomorrow.

1120
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:11,772
- Get your hands out of the pockets. - What?

1121
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:13,874
- Get your hands out of the pockets. - It was designed for that purpose.

1122
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,643
- No, it's not. - You think so?

1123
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,278
(Taking out his hands)

1124
00:41:17,278 --> 00:41:18,412
- You think so? - Yes.

1125
00:41:18,412 --> 00:41:20,147
(Looking humble)

1126
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:22,016
- He took out his hands! He did it! - My gosh.

1127
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:25,119
Se Chan, So Min, and Ji Hyo are exempted from the penalty.

1128
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,187
- They can't be chosen. - Sorry?

1129
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:28,255
Shorry, you can hug the member you want to...

1130
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:30,558
- go fishing together from the back. - Okay.

1131
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:32,560
- I can hug from behind? - This makes me nervous.

1132
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,796
- I will act natural. - "Natural"?

1133
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:37,331
- Just be yourself. - I'll choose a member.

1134
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:40,134
- I will be myself. - He kept discussing made-up stuff.

1135
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:42,503
- Be yourself. - That word comes up like 200 times.

1136
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:45,473
- Don't sell your soul for laughter. - Okay.

1137
00:41:45,473 --> 00:41:47,908
- Let them laugh naturally. - I'll be myself.

1138
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:49,143
Make them laugh naturally.

1139
00:41:49,143 --> 00:41:51,545
(Shorry promises to be himself when making his choice.)

1140
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,147
- Here I go. - Byung Jae...

1141
00:41:53,814 --> 00:41:56,517
(Will he choose Byung Jae since he's been harboring ill feelings?)

1142
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:58,385
What if he chooses Kyeong Hwan which makes no sense?

1143
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:00,554
- Hey, don't mention my name. - He won't make it look forced.

1144
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,389
(Will he choose Kyeong Hwan since he's easier to deal with?)

1145
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,158
I'll make my decision now.

1146
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,593
(Which member will Shorry choose?)

1147
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:06,660
(Coming up)

1148
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,529
(A new, grand project will be revealed.)

1149
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,097
(A 4-week project of guided tours)

1150
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,600
(Extreme ends of guided tours, luxury versus horror)

1151
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,335
(Will they really go there? They are shocked.)

1152
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,971
(Four sought-after stars whom Running Man fostered will join.)

1153
00:42:16,971 --> 00:42:22,276
(The beginning of these 4 weeks will decide their destinations.)

1154
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,780
(Stay tuned. It's coming up!)

1155
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,314
I'll make my decision now.

1156
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:29,283
(They won't know when they will be done with the penalty.)

1157
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:33,687
(Who is Shorry's most-logical partner for indoor fishing?)

1158
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,389
Come with me, my friend!

1159
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,558
Come with me, my friend!

1160
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:41,629
(Buddy, join me!)

1161
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:44,031
(Come with me, Jong Kook!)

1162
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:45,866
My buddy!

1163
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:48,202
(Shorry's decision was very logical.)

1164
00:42:48,202 --> 00:42:49,870
We won!

1165
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,338
(This is a happy ending for us too.)

1166
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:52,439
Okay, let me go. Okay.

1167
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,475
- It's already decided. Let me go. - My gosh.

1168
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:56,377
You made your decision, so let me go.

1169
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:59,547
- I'm letting you go now. - Focus. Stand right here.

1170
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:01,649
- "Focus"? - Stand right here.

1171
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:04,151
Watch the show, and see for yourself how forced this looks.

1172
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:07,154
You know what? Just watch the show. See if this is funny.

1173
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,323
- It's funny. - It's funny.

1174
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:11,592
Mark my words. I'll make sure all of your airtime...

1175
00:43:11,592 --> 00:43:12,893
comes from the penalty.

1176
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,663
- How much more will he appear? - I made myself clear.

1177
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,532
- You'll see. - This wraps up today's race.

1178
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:21,769
Shorry and Jong Kook will carry out the penalty...

1179
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:25,039
which was a very logical and natural turn of events.

1180
00:43:27,041 --> 00:43:28,642
We've never gone fishing together.

1181
00:43:28,642 --> 00:43:29,777
(Their trip continues.)

1182
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:33,113
(They arrive at an indoor fishing site in Incheon at 12am.)

1183
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:34,248
I can't believe this.

1184
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:36,450
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1185
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,586
(Silence)

1186
00:43:38,652 --> 00:43:40,888
We'd better finish in one hour.

1187
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:42,256
- Okay, sir. - If we don't catch in an hour...

1188
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,225
Then I'll go in the water.

1189
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:47,795
(However,)

1190
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:51,432
(the water is way too quiet.)

1191
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,805
(He gets anxious.)

1192
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,774
Just stay still.

1193
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,543
- I'm getting anxious. - If you're loud,

1194
00:44:02,543 --> 00:44:04,245
the fish will run away.

1195
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:05,412
Okay, Jong Kook.

1196
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:06,914
Let me see.

1197
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:08,883
- Is it a lobster? - They caught one.

1198
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,117
(Other customers keep catching.)

1199
00:44:10,451 --> 00:44:11,852
I'm jealous of them.

1200
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,690
- It moved. - Pull it.

1201
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,892
I'll pull it.

1202
00:44:17,892 --> 00:44:20,895
(Shorry rushes as something bites.)

1203
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,965
- Pull it fast. - We didn't catch anything.

1204
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,369
It definitely got caught but ran away.

1205
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:29,870
Right?

1206
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,407
(Uncomfortable silence returns.)

1207
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:37,144
(Does their friendship get better as time passes?)

1208
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,612
I want to go home now.

1209
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:40,447
(Their fishing continued.)

1210
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,182
I really want to go home.

1211
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,787
(Spring arrived soon.)

1212
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:50,124
(It's a peaceful morning at Jinhae Station in Changwon.)

1213
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:54,128
- Hello. - Hello.

1214
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,764
It's such a beautiful day.

1215
00:44:56,764 --> 00:44:57,831
(Even Jong Kook is happy.)

1216
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,333
Why did he dress up?

1217
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:00,534
- I don't know. - How could you dress like that?

1218
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:02,736
(Se Shan keeps dressing up with a black jacket.)

1219
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:04,505
I have to wear something black for Jong Kook.

1220
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:06,173
- Good job. - I have to wear something black.

1221
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:07,241
That's how...

1222
00:45:07,241 --> 00:45:09,677
Jong Kook wears black often.

1223
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:12,046
You wear more black after appearing on "Mom's Diary".

1224
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,581
(Does he wear black after the show was aired?)

1225
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,583
No, I always wore black.

1226
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,085
It's for his character.

1227
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:20,054
You used to wear gray at times.

1228
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:22,089
Jae Seok, I hate being artificial the most.

1229
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,325
(Jae Seok, I hate being artificial the most.)

1230
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:26,327
- Jong Kook. - He starts again.

1231
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,295
I don't dress according to the show that I'm on.

1232
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:30,497
Is that why all your furniture is black?

1233
00:45:30,497 --> 00:45:33,400
I'm not artificial. It's because I like black.

1234
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,502
Fine. Just don't get upset.

1235
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:38,072
It's not something to get upset about.

1236
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:40,107
You sound too artificial, don't you?

1237
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:42,176
- Isn't this too artificial? - No.

1238
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:43,877
- No. - Goodness.

1239
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:46,647
Isn't it too early to wear shorts?

1240
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:47,948
(He calls out Jong Kook.)

1241
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:50,050
It's not early. It's too hot.

1242
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,652
I see goose bumps.

1243
00:45:51,652 --> 00:45:52,920
It's hot.

1244
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,788
It's perfect for shorts.

1245
00:45:54,822 --> 00:45:56,156
(She stares at him.)

1246
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:57,458
- So Min. - Yes?

1247
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,625
What is it, So Min?

1248
00:45:58,625 --> 00:45:59,693
What were you thinking?

1249
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:02,496
I was too scared to ask if these were pajamas.

1250
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:03,931
They are not.

1251
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,566
I have about 10 pairs of them.

1252
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:07,334
Most people...

1253
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:10,404
don't layer their clothes of the same color.

1254
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,106
- Black on black? - What's this?

1255
00:46:12,106 --> 00:46:13,307
- What's this? - My undershirt.

1256
00:46:13,307 --> 00:46:15,275
- What's this? - My middle shirt.

1257
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,244
(It's his undershirt.)

1258
00:46:17,244 --> 00:46:18,846
(It's his middle shirt.)

1259
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,547
- Is that your outer shirt? - Yes.

1260
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:22,850
- Do you wear three layers? - Yes.

1261
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:25,352
That means that you're cold.

1262
00:46:25,986 --> 00:46:28,389
He wears three layers of clothes.

1263
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:30,457
- That's impressive. - I usually wear three layers.

1264
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:33,560
Anyway, we'll be here today.

1265
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,962
It's full of spring energy.

1266
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,630
- It's great. - It's amazing.

1267
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,865
It's warm.

1268
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,466
- As you can see, - Flowers bloomed.

1269
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:42,002
- flowers are blooming. - Are those cherry blossoms?

1270
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:45,706
Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival will start soon.

1271
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:47,841
Isn't Haha the son of Changwon?

1272
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:49,009
- Everyone. - Why is he the son of Changwon?

1273
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:51,378
How's the weather in Changwon?

1274
00:46:51,378 --> 00:46:52,479
- Are you... - Didn't I tell you?

1275
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,014
I told you that I lived in Changwon.

1276
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,582
- How long did you live here? - For how long?

1277
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:56,650
I graduated from elementary school.

1278
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,285
How long did you live in Mapo-gu?

1279
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:03,057
I'm the son of Changwon.

1280
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:05,893
- Is that so? - Those from Changwon are...

1281
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,061
Kang Dong Won and Lee Joon Gi.

1282
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,629
You should be out.

1283
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:10,664
- But... - They already exist.

1284
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,966
- the mayor was so proud. - Stop joking.

1285
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:14,268
My goodness.

1286
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:15,469
(Come to Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival.)

1287
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:16,570
Anyway,

1288
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,806
I think we have some guests today.

1289
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:19,873
- Right. - Really?

1290
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:21,775
- I read it on the news. - Right.

1291
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:24,311
(Who will be coming?)

1292
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,646
Everyone.

1293
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:28,849
Spring, a new season arrived.

1294
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,385
We have a new project for the spring.

1295
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:32,386
Right.

1296
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:34,588
It's called Family Package Project.

1297
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:38,459
(It's full of fun Family Package Project)

1298
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:40,060
For the next four weeks,

1299
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,529
with your family-like members on Running Man,

1300
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,898
you'll be on a new project.

1301
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:45,966
- 4 weeks? - 4 weeks?

1302
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,734
- For one month? - I heard that...

1303
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,803
there's a guest whom Jong Kook fears.

1304
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:50,838
- Who? - I read in an article.

1305
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:52,906
- I heard Jin Young is coming. - Jin Young.

1306
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,075
Jong Kook is scared of Jin Young.

1307
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:56,076
- She's really coming. - Yes.

1308
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:58,212
- Is Jin Young coming? - Yes.

1309
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,780
His tone of voice became friendly.

1310
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:05,319
(Have you been waiting for me?)

1311
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,288
- He'll be a baby for four weeks. - I couldn't even talk.

1312
00:48:08,288 --> 00:48:10,424
He couldn't say anything to Jin Young.

1313
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:12,793
First of all, we have...

1314
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,461
four new guests...

1315
00:48:14,461 --> 00:48:16,330
- Four guests? - who will be on the project.

1316
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,965
I'll introduce them.

1317
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:19,633
- Really? - Is there a male guest?

1318
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:20,734
- What's this? - Of course.

1319
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:22,169
It can't be four females.

1320
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:23,904
- I'm sure there is. - Why do you ask?

1321
00:48:25,472 --> 00:48:27,307
- What's this? - We gave you a phone.

1322
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:29,743
Your family members sent the characters...

1323
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,712
that look like them with a message.

1324
00:48:31,712 --> 00:48:35,349
(The guests send characters that look like them.)

1325
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:38,252
I tried it before, and it works. Is it called Emoji?

1326
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,486
- Really? - Yes.

1327
00:48:39,486 --> 00:48:41,021
- Wait, a message arrived. - It arrived.

1328
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,222
Let's see.

1329
00:48:42,222 --> 00:48:45,826
(Who could it be?)

1330
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:48,629
I'm sorry.

1331
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:49,930
What's wrong?

1332
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,999
- Is it because of my face? - Your shadows block my view.

1333
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,567
- Let me see it too. - I'm sorry.

1334
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:54,868
- Can you stay back? - I'm curious.

1335
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:55,869
Be calm.

1336
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:57,471
Is Running Man yours?

1337
00:48:58,172 --> 00:48:59,573
You're being too harsh.

1338
00:48:59,573 --> 00:49:01,475
- My goodness. - That's childish.

1339
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,210
It's so childish that I'm lost for words.

1340
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,778
"Is Running Man yours?"

1341
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:05,812
I want to see it too.

1342
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:06,813
(You aren't in the center.)

1343
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:08,148
(Whispering)

1344
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:11,985
Jae Seok told me to tell you that it's his.

1345
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:14,655
- He has a lot of shares. - No matter whose it is,

1346
00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,557
he has more shares than you.

1347
00:49:16,857 --> 00:49:18,158
- Hey. - If we had to determine it.

1348
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:19,793
- You shouldn't say that. - Wait.

1349
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,528
- What? - It arrived.

1350
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:23,130
A face came up.

1351
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,332
"Hello, it's been a while." She's been on the show before.

1352
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,134
- She looks similar to Jin Young. - It looks like her.

1353
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:28,168
Who is it?

1354
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,536
Her hair is long.

1355
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:31,438
She has a typo, so she must be older.

1356
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:32,639
"Hello, it's been a while."

1357
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:35,042
Based on the sound of her laughter,

1358
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:36,510
it seems like...

1359
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,711
It's Da Hee.

1360
00:49:38,078 --> 00:49:39,713
Is this Da Hee?

1361
00:49:39,713 --> 00:49:40,781
Wait.

1362
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:42,950
- Who is it? - Her hair is short.

1363
00:49:43,517 --> 00:49:45,018
- Isn't it Da Hee? - It's Jin Young.

1364
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:46,653
- It's Da Hee. - It's Jin Young.

1365
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:47,921
Who's this?

1366
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,057
It's Shin Bong Sun.

1367
00:49:50,057 --> 00:49:51,325
It's Kang Han Na.

1368
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:53,894
Shin Bong Sun? No, it's Kang Han Na.

1369
00:49:53,894 --> 00:49:55,429
- Wait. - There's another one.

1370
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:56,830
- It's a man. - It's a man.

1371
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:57,965
He looks like someone.

1372
00:49:57,965 --> 00:49:59,333
- It's Lee Jee Hoon. - I'm so nervous.

1373
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,934
- Who is it? - It looks like Lee Jee Hoon.

1374
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,169
Isn't it Jae Seok?

1375
00:50:02,302 --> 00:50:03,370
No, it's not me.

1376
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,838
Anyway, they're Kang Han Na.

1377
00:50:04,838 --> 00:50:06,006
- Hong Jin Young. - Hong Jin Young.

1378
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:07,040
- Lee Da Hee. - Lee Da Hee.

1379
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,208
Who's the man?

1380
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,876
- Jee Hoon? - I don't know.

1381
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,411
Who's the last guest?

1382
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:14,047
(Which 4 family members will they be with?)

1383
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:16,350
Let's see if your guesses are correct.

1384
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:19,519
We'll invite the first family member.

1385
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,787
Is it Han Na?

1386
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:22,055
- I'm excited. - I don't think so.

1387
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:24,858
First family member, please come out.

1388
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:26,393
Let's invite her.

1389
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:29,529
(It's an S.E.S song.)

1390
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:31,498
- It's Da Hee. - Da Hee.

1391
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:32,933
There she is.

1392
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,570
The swindler character is back.

1393
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,405
She's back.

1394
00:50:38,772 --> 00:50:44,478
(She annihilated the dance battle with a hair band.)

1395
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:50,984
(She destroyed Kwang Soo by calling him a jerk.)

1396
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:55,289
(She enters shyly after closing the door.)

1397
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,291
"You're a thief."

1398
00:50:57,524 --> 00:50:58,892
Look at that.

1399
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:01,061
- What's wrong with her? Da Hee. - She can't do anything at once.

1400
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:03,363
What's wrong with her? Da Hee.

1401
00:51:03,363 --> 00:51:05,032
- She can't do anything at once. - Da Hee.

1402
00:51:05,198 --> 00:51:06,433
Come here now.

1403
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:07,901
(She's busy saying hello.)

1404
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:10,237
- Da Hee. - Hello.

1405
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:13,173
- Hello. - Hello.

1406
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:15,709
I feel hurt.

1407
00:51:15,709 --> 00:51:18,945
- Why? - As soon as she saw me...

1408
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:20,414
No way.

1409
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,283
(She passes So Min.)

1410
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,385
She held up her fists at me.

1411
00:51:25,552 --> 00:51:26,853
This is what she did to me.

1412
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:28,288
- She doesn't like me. - Hey.

1413
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:30,123
Do you know what she did to Se Chan?

1414
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:31,925
(Flinching)

1415
00:51:31,992 --> 00:51:33,427
To me?

1416
00:51:33,827 --> 00:51:36,563
This is our first guest.

1417
00:51:36,563 --> 00:51:38,965
- She's our hero. - It's Lee Da Hee.

1418
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,334
Hello.

1419
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,469
The jerk's friend, Lee Da Hee.

1420
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:43,537
As Da Hee knows,

1421
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:45,839
as soon as she appeared on our show,

1422
00:51:45,906 --> 00:51:47,674
she made a popular phrase that's hard to make.

1423
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:49,609
- "You're a jerk." - It's been a while.

1424
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,811
- It was amazing. - Right.

1425
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:52,179
She brought it too.

1426
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:53,680
- What is it? - Kwang Soo.

1427
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,682
- I brought it for you. - What is it?

1428
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:57,184
(It's the bag that she used last time.)

1429
00:51:57,184 --> 00:51:59,386
- Did you bring something? - Yes.

1430
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:01,655
- What is it? - Did you throw away yours?

1431
00:52:01,655 --> 00:52:02,723
I...

1432
00:52:02,723 --> 00:52:04,658
remember our past.

1433
00:52:04,658 --> 00:52:05,792
(What's this card?)

1434
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:10,797
(Do you remember the nasty race that we had?)

1435
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,133
(She said that her number was 6.)

1436
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:18,739
(She kept her number 5 card until now.)

1437
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,574
(She remembers that time.)

1438
00:52:20,574 --> 00:52:23,076
- What? - Did she keep that card?

1439
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,747
(What's wrong with her?)

1440
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,750
Take out money or something, Kwang Soo.

1441
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,985
- What? - Take out something.

1442
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,553
Did you throw away yours?

1443
00:52:33,553 --> 00:52:37,758
(Did you throw away our souvenir?)

1444
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:39,926
- Of course, he did. - Did you throw yours away?

1445
00:52:39,926 --> 00:52:42,529
Stop forcing yourselves to be romantic.

1446
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:44,998
(Haha acts like a sheriff.)

1447
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:47,267
- It's too artificial. - I hate this the most.

1448
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:49,202
- It's too artificial. - No, it's not.

1449
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:50,704
- Come on. - It's not artificial.

1450
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,572
Love ended between Ji Hyo and Gary.

1451
00:52:52,572 --> 00:52:54,341
- Seriously. - Goodness.

1452
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,309
Now, I have a good friend.

1453
00:52:56,343 --> 00:52:58,812
- It's impressive that she has it. - Seriously.

1454
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:00,414
Why did you keep it?

1455
00:53:00,414 --> 00:53:02,816
I just kept everything.

1456
00:53:02,816 --> 00:53:05,819
The staff was upset that the card disappeared.

1457
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:08,388
Da Hee, you're supposed to return it.

1458
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,190
Do you have kleptomania?

1459
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:11,792
Don't say that.

1460
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:14,361
- She can't take things. - That's too harsh.

1461
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,296
I like it. It's a good size.

1462
00:53:16,296 --> 00:53:18,064
Really? What do you carry inside?

1463
00:53:18,098 --> 00:53:19,866
I carry...

1464
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:22,469
- my cell phone and a pen. - Really?

1465
00:53:22,469 --> 00:53:24,404
- You kept the same things inside. - Scissors.

1466
00:53:24,404 --> 00:53:26,606
- Scissors? - Why do you carry them?

1467
00:53:26,606 --> 00:53:28,141
Wait, Da Hee.

1468
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:30,777
You took scissors and a pen.

1469
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:33,180
Your nickname is Thief Lee from now on.

1470
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:36,082
(A beautiful entertainer is suspicious of being a thief.)

1471
00:53:36,116 --> 00:53:38,852
How could you call her that?

1472
00:53:38,852 --> 00:53:40,687
I'm just joking.

1473
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,891
- Seok Jin, do you want this? - What is it?

1474
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:47,627
I felt so bad about that day, so I brought some herbal medicine.

1475
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:50,297
(Herbal medicine?)

1476
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:51,465
Herbal medicine?

1477
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:54,501
I wouldn't say no to this.

1478
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:55,802
(Struggling)

1479
00:53:55,802 --> 00:53:56,870
He can't even open it.

1480
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,972
Give me something that opens!

1481
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:01,174
(Give me something that opens!)

1482
00:54:02,209 --> 00:54:03,877
- Let me try. - Gosh.

1483
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:06,379
- Why can't you open it? - It won't open.

1484
00:54:06,379 --> 00:54:07,981
It's open.

1485
00:54:08,114 --> 00:54:09,749
You just have to pull the lid off.

1486
00:54:09,749 --> 00:54:12,819
I was going to give it to my partner...

1487
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:16,957
at the last shooting...

1488
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:18,558
That means it's very old.

1489
00:54:19,626 --> 00:54:21,995
(It was last January.)

1490
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:23,864
- Check the expiration date. - Check it.

1491
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:27,000
Isn't it expired? Will it give you a stomachache?

1492
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,568
It'll be all right.

1493
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:30,070
Check the expiration date.

1494
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,338
What are you doing?

1495
00:54:31,338 --> 00:54:32,639
(What is with her?)

1496
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:33,974
She wanted to give it to her partner.

1497
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:35,909
- It smells okay. - Are you sure?

1498
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:38,011
It's herbal medicine.

1499
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:39,379
It's giving me energy.

1500
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:43,850
Seok Jin really smells like an old man now.

1501
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,052
It's the medicine.

1502
00:54:46,052 --> 00:54:47,621
It's the smell of the medicine.

1503
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:52,859
Let's meet our next guest.

1504
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:53,960
Okay.

1505
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:56,296
(Ring)

1506
00:54:56,296 --> 00:55:00,433
(Jin Young is here.)

1507
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:01,735
Look.

1508
00:55:01,735 --> 00:55:03,637
- Here she is! - Here she is!

1509
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,739
(With her new song, "Goodbye", playing,)

1510
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:08,808
(the intense girl appears.)

1511
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:10,343
No one can stop her.

1512
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,478
(Hong Jin Young)

1513
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,546
This is strong.

1514
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,981
(Hey, Jong Kook.)

1515
00:55:15,982 --> 00:55:19,786
(She can keep Jong Kook under control.)

1516
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:22,656
(She can even make him do cute things.)

1517
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:25,625
She's even wearing black pants and shoes.

1518
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,594
- Black pants. - She's Jong Kook's partner.

1519
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:29,095
Come stand here.

1520
00:55:29,095 --> 00:55:30,530
- Hi. - Stand here.

1521
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:31,932
(Goodbye)

1522
00:55:31,932 --> 00:55:33,667
I love this song.

1523
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,635
- I love it. - Seriously.

1524
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:37,871
- Jin Young. - Yes?

1525
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,706
- Well... - Hi.

1526
00:55:40,106 --> 00:55:43,176
Jin Young is here.

1527
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:46,446
"Goodbye" is so popular these days.

1528
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,783
(Goodbye)

1529
00:55:49,783 --> 00:55:51,284
(Forget everything)

1530
00:55:51,284 --> 00:55:52,285
(Forget me)

1531
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:54,120
All right.

1532
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:57,824
You haven't been on Running Man for a while.

1533
00:55:57,824 --> 00:56:00,293
Nice to see you. It's been a while.

1534
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,297
Jong Kook already feels uncomfortable.

1535
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:06,566
- You've lost a lot of weight. - Jong Kook feels uncomfortable.

1536
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:07,867
You've lost a lot of weight.

1537
00:56:07,867 --> 00:56:11,271
There was a rumor that...

1538
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,807
something was going on between Jin Young and Jong Kook.

1539
00:56:13,807 --> 00:56:15,041
- So... - What do you think about it?

1540
00:56:15,675 --> 00:56:16,843
About us?

1541
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:20,246
(I shouldn't be standing here.)

1542
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,349
Da Hee, where are you going?

1543
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:24,851
- Da Hee, where are you going? - I don't want to be there.

1544
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:27,053
I heard it gave you a bit of trouble.

1545
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,655
- It gave you trouble? - Jin Young...

1546
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:29,856
- experienced a bit of trouble. - You did?

1547
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:33,126
When the article about my joining Running Man...

1548
00:56:33,126 --> 00:56:35,395
for four weeks came out,

1549
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,365
a foreigner sent me a message on social media.

1550
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:39,466
What did it say?

1551
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:43,203
(She received a message from a foreigner.)

1552
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:48,108
"If you hit on Jong Kook, I'll kill you."

1553
00:56:48,308 --> 00:56:49,976
- Really? - I mean...

1554
00:56:49,976 --> 00:56:52,979
When she entered,

1555
00:56:52,979 --> 00:56:56,383
she seemed to flinch when she saw me.

1556
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,851
I wondered why.

1557
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:00,887
- I mean... - Ji Hyo and Jong Kook's fans...

1558
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:02,856
want to protect them.

1559
00:57:02,856 --> 00:57:04,724
Please translate this.

1560
00:57:04,724 --> 00:57:06,693
It's not like I'm going to stay here forever.

1561
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:10,764
I can disappear like the wind at any moment.

1562
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,366
Jin Young is scared.

1563
00:57:13,366 --> 00:57:15,802
- I'm like the wind. - You're like the wind.

1564
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:18,104
I'm sure my fans were joking.

1565
00:57:18,104 --> 00:57:20,540
Even his fans make such jokes?

1566
00:57:20,907 --> 00:57:23,877
- They're just like me. - How could they say that though?

1567
00:57:23,877 --> 00:57:25,545
I haven't killed you although I joke about it.

1568
00:57:25,545 --> 00:57:27,347
But who knows?

1569
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:29,049
(Who knows?)

1570
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,785
- Wait and see. - You might not have noticed,

1571
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,586
but he is slowly dying.

1572
00:57:33,687 --> 00:57:34,788
Look at him.

1573
00:57:34,788 --> 00:57:35,989
- Is it because of me? - He's under stress.

1574
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:38,391
- He is slowly dying from stress. - I weigh only 38kg.

1575
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:42,262
Jin Young and Da Hee have joined us.

1576
00:57:42,262 --> 00:57:43,630
Da Hee, why are you standing here?

1577
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,132
I don't want to stand between those two.

1578
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:47,701
- She wanted to escape. - Really?

1579
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,302
Nothing is going on between them.

1580
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:51,771
Stop pretending to be thoughtful.

1581
00:57:53,373 --> 00:57:54,641
(If you say so...)

1582
00:57:55,842 --> 00:57:57,343
(She goes back.)

1583
00:57:57,343 --> 00:58:00,480
- I know. - But you didn't have to come back.

1584
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,248
Why would you stand there?

1585
00:58:02,582 --> 00:58:04,751
- She wants to stand in the middle. - No, no.

1586
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:07,253
- They're both wearing green. - Make yourself comfortable.

1587
00:58:07,253 --> 00:58:08,922
- I don't want to stand there. - Stand next to Kwang Soo.

1588
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:11,257
Hey, why are you wearing green?

1589
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:14,494
- You look like a frog. - Exactly.

1590
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:16,629
She's found her place.

1591
00:58:16,963 --> 00:58:18,264
This looks better.

1592
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,102
Their height difference looks perfect.

1593
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,136
- That's right. - That's right.

1594
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:24,738
Your height difference looks good too.

1595
00:58:24,904 --> 00:58:26,573
- The colors of your outfits too. - Jong Kook.

1596
00:58:26,573 --> 00:58:27,574
Black?

1597
00:58:27,574 --> 00:58:31,144
(Black?)

1598
00:58:32,178 --> 00:58:33,513
Her hair is black too.

1599
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,982
Jin Young is here with us.

1600
00:58:35,982 --> 00:58:39,786
Let's meet our next guest. Please come out!

1601
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:43,590
(A girl with elegant bobbed hair)

1602
00:58:45,024 --> 00:58:47,427
(She surprises everyone.)

1603
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:52,732
(A girl with elegant bobbed hair)

1604
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,569
(She surprises everyone.)

1605
00:58:57,303 --> 00:58:58,505
It's Han Na.

1606
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,206
- It's been a while. - Han Na.

1607
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:02,075
It's Han Na.

1608
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:03,843
- Oh, My. - Hi, Han Na.

1609
00:59:03,843 --> 00:59:05,044
The emoticon looked just like her.

1610
00:59:05,044 --> 00:59:07,614
It looked elegant.

1611
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:11,885
(Her crazy dance moves...)

1612
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:16,856
(made her the scene-stealer.)

1613
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:19,893
The funniest thing about Han Na is that...

1614
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:21,494
she pretends to be normal.

1615
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:23,296
During the opening, she pretends to be normal.

1616
00:59:23,296 --> 00:59:24,531
I am normal.

1617
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:28,701
I don't know whom your partner will be today,

1618
00:59:28,735 --> 00:59:31,604
but is there...

1619
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:35,675
(Laughing)

1620
00:59:35,675 --> 00:59:36,676
What is it?

1621
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:39,946
(Why is she laughing?)

1622
00:59:40,346 --> 00:59:42,115
It's beginning.

1623
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:44,417
- Stop pretending to be normal. - It's beginning.

1624
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:46,119
- Come on. - It was so random.

1625
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,220
No one else laughed.

1626
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,922
It gave me goose bumps.

1627
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,757
She suddenly laughed coldly.

1628
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,625
Stop it. She didn't.

1629
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:54,127
She suddenly stared into the air and...

1630
00:59:54,127 --> 00:59:55,895
(Laughing)

1631
00:59:55,895 --> 00:59:57,564
- Why did you do that? - I saw it too.

1632
00:59:57,564 --> 00:59:59,632
- I saw it. - What made you laugh?

1633
00:59:59,632 --> 01:00:02,302
Jae Seok seemed to be stumbling over his words.

1634
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:04,137
She must have inhaled some helium.

1635
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:05,271
"Jae Seok seemed to..."

1636
01:00:05,972 --> 01:00:08,107
"I mean..."

1637
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:09,209
What are you doing?

1638
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:11,878
I suddenly found it funny.

1639
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:16,783
All right. I never finished my question,

1640
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,818
but Han Na must have known what I was going to ask.

1641
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,486
- What were you asking? - Her partner?

1642
01:00:20,486 --> 01:00:22,655
Yes. I was going to ask her...

1643
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:25,658
if there was anyone she didn't want as her partner.

1644
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:28,261
She probably knew what I was going to ask.

1645
01:00:28,261 --> 01:00:29,629
- She probably knows. - You probably guessed it right.

1646
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,231
I guessed it right? Okay.

1647
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:32,732
All right.

1648
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,134
Seok Jin, stop pretending to be cool.

1649
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:37,003
- Stop it. - Should I cry?

1650
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:38,805
- Am I supposed to cry here? - Stop it.

1651
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:39,906
What do you expect me to do?

1652
01:00:39,906 --> 01:00:41,841
- I have to smile. - Smile.

1653
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:43,109
Do whatever you want.

1654
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:45,111
(Let's see.)

1655
01:00:45,211 --> 01:00:48,648
(She has a feeling that she can't escape him.)

1656
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:51,317
Han Na, will you be free on these days...

1657
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,419
for the next few weeks?

1658
01:00:53,419 --> 01:00:55,421
Yes. I have no other plans than Running Man.

1659
01:00:55,421 --> 01:00:57,156
She'll be with us for the next month?

1660
01:00:57,156 --> 01:00:59,459
- She'll be with us for four weeks. - Han Na,

1661
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:04,097
Da Hee and Jin Young will be with us for the next four weeks.

1662
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:05,798
Aren't they busy?

1663
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:07,467
- What? - Can they really do it?

1664
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:08,668
- You don't like it? - That's not what I mean.

1665
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:09,736
That's not it.

1666
01:01:10,403 --> 01:01:11,905
I love this.

1667
01:01:11,905 --> 01:01:14,307
Jin Young is busy.

1668
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:16,743
- It's so funny. - She's busy.

1669
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:19,946
Jin Young.

1670
01:01:19,946 --> 01:01:21,915
She's the best.

1671
01:01:22,215 --> 01:01:25,418
Han Na is with us.

1672
01:01:25,418 --> 01:01:26,586
(They've met 3 female guests.)

1673
01:01:26,586 --> 01:01:27,921
I love it.

1674
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:30,957
Our last guest is a man, but I don't know who he is.

1675
01:01:30,957 --> 01:01:33,326
- A man with glasses. - Yes.

1676
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:34,460
Please come out.

1677
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,895
- Who is he? - I don't know.

1678
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:39,299
- Is he a member of iKon? - Really?

1679
01:01:39,299 --> 01:01:41,534
(This song is "Love Scenario" by iKon.)

1680
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:44,203
- It's Sang Yeob. - Sang Yeob.

1681
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,539
- It's Sang Yeob. - Sang Yeob.

1682
01:01:46,973 --> 01:01:48,241
Hey.

1683
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:51,678
- I knew it. - You guys don't look so happy.

1684
01:01:51,678 --> 01:01:52,912
(Lee Sang Yeob)

1685
01:01:54,113 --> 01:01:58,785
(An actor with a thousand voices...)

1686
01:01:58,785 --> 01:02:03,957
(turned into a variety show ace.)

1687
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,926
- Sang Yeob. - Hello.

1688
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,561
Sang Yeob, we see you often these days.

1689
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:11,297
Is he a regular member now?

1690
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:14,567
Did you empty your Mondays and Tuesdays?

1691
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,269
I don't think I've seen him looking this nice before.

1692
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,670
- Who? - Sang Yeob.

1693
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,772
He's like this every week. Don't say that.

1694
01:02:19,772 --> 01:02:21,908
No, I tried to look nice today.

1695
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,676
- You did? - Yes.

1696
01:02:23,676 --> 01:02:26,045
- His voice changed. - The tone is different.

1697
01:02:26,045 --> 01:02:27,780
- That tone is for variety shows. - It's true.

1698
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,615
- Hey. - He sounds silly.

1699
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,985
- "I tried to look nice today." - Hold on.

1700
01:02:32,118 --> 01:02:33,486
- Hey. - He sounds silly.

1701
01:02:33,486 --> 01:02:35,021
- Don't say that. - I'm joking.

1702
01:02:35,021 --> 01:02:38,691
Have you all met Sang Yeob before?

1703
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:40,927
- It's my first time seeing him. - You too, Da Hee?

1704
01:02:40,927 --> 01:02:42,495
I saw...

1705
01:02:42,562 --> 01:02:44,998
Jin Young...

1706
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:46,632
- in a restaurant. - Yes, it was a pork belly place.

1707
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,468
- I was asking you about Sang Yeob. - I see.

1708
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:52,405
They're all weird.

1709
01:02:52,805 --> 01:02:54,007
What is she talking about?

1710
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:55,408
- Jin Young is the most normal. - That's why...

1711
01:02:55,408 --> 01:02:57,377
we brought them back.

1712
01:02:57,577 --> 01:02:59,012
- They're all weird. - They are.

1713
01:02:59,012 --> 01:03:00,413
- We are weird too. - They're so weird.

1714
01:03:00,413 --> 01:03:02,248
I got goosebumps a few times today.

1715
01:03:02,248 --> 01:03:05,385
I asked her about Sang Yeob, but she was talking about a restaurant.

1716
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:08,087
Everybody's here including Sang Yeob.

1717
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:09,355
(All the weird people are here including Sang Yeob.)

1718
01:03:09,355 --> 01:03:10,490
They're the best.

1719
01:03:10,757 --> 01:03:13,593
We'll be conducting a Family Package Project...

1720
01:03:13,593 --> 01:03:16,796
with the new family for four weeks.

1721
01:03:16,996 --> 01:03:20,366
You'll race every week, and if you win,

1722
01:03:20,366 --> 01:03:23,269
you'll receive the luxury package filled with luck and happiness.

1723
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:25,038
If you lose,

1724
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:26,639
you'll get the Shuddering Package...

1725
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,708
and go on a global trip.

1726
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:30,243
Global? I guess we're going overseas again.

1727
01:03:30,243 --> 01:03:32,545
Why do we have to go somewhere that makes us shudder?

1728
01:03:32,545 --> 01:03:34,881
- Let's go somewhere nice. - That's what I mean.

1729
01:03:34,881 --> 01:03:36,349
The destinations...

1730
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:39,485
were recommended by the four members of the new family.

1731
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:40,486
Really?

1732
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:43,623
(They were recommended by the 4 members of the new family.)

1733
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:45,358
- It must be somewhere nice. - Right.

1734
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:48,094
(I recommended some places?)

1735
01:03:48,194 --> 01:03:50,329
They probably don't know that they recommended some places.

1736
01:03:50,897 --> 01:03:52,899
Let's watch a clip...

1737
01:03:52,932 --> 01:03:54,534
and find out what they chose.

1738
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:57,203
Hey, what should we do now?

1739
01:03:57,203 --> 01:03:58,971
- Let's go somewhere nice. - We should.

1740
01:03:58,971 --> 01:04:00,573
I really want to go somewhere nice.

1741
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,544
(A few days ago, at an office in Yeouido)

1742
01:04:04,544 --> 01:04:07,313
(Why is Sang Yeob here?)

1743
01:04:07,313 --> 01:04:08,648
What? When did they meet up?

1744
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,516
(You had no idea, right?)

1745
01:04:10,516 --> 01:04:12,852
You'll be participating...

1746
01:04:12,852 --> 01:04:15,988
in the Running Man family project for four weeks.

1747
01:04:15,988 --> 01:04:19,492
We don't know what kind of traveling you like.

1748
01:04:19,492 --> 01:04:21,694
We have a questionnaire...

1749
01:04:21,694 --> 01:04:24,063
about your traveling styles.

1750
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,233
Please fill it out so that we can refer to it.

1751
01:04:28,434 --> 01:04:30,903
Name is Hong Jin Young.

1752
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:32,905
I've never done this before.

1753
01:04:32,905 --> 01:04:34,574
I don't have anything I need to take.

1754
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:36,943
I have to have instant noodles. I need food.

1755
01:04:36,943 --> 01:04:40,546
I can last a few days with instant noodles, so I need it.

1756
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:42,315
Good job.

1757
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,617
- We need instant noodles. - It's a must.

1758
01:04:44,684 --> 01:04:47,019
There is something I don't want to take.

1759
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:48,754
The step counter.

1760
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:51,691
(He doesn't want to take the step counter.)

1761
01:04:52,191 --> 01:04:53,292
(He doesn't even want to look at it again.)

1762
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,927
It's going to give me neurosis.

1763
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:57,763
- I don't want to take... - No step counter?

1764
01:04:57,763 --> 01:05:00,099
the step counter.

1765
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,002
For the necessities,

1766
01:05:03,002 --> 01:05:04,370
can I write "Lee Kwang Soo"?

1767
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,471
(Me?)

1768
01:05:05,471 --> 01:05:06,572
- Why? - Really?

1769
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,408
Kwang Soo...

1770
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:13,279
has this irresistible charm.

1771
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,348
- He moves your heart. - I'm touched.

1772
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:16,482
I'll write Kwang Soo.

1773
01:05:16,549 --> 01:05:17,917
(His heart races.)

1774
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:19,185
Kwang Soo.

1775
01:05:19,552 --> 01:05:22,121
I've never been a couple with a guy.

1776
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:23,222
(I'm nervous. I've never been a couple with a guy.)

1777
01:05:23,422 --> 01:05:26,292
"Which member do you want to go on a trip with?"

1778
01:05:26,292 --> 01:05:28,261
(She's shy.)

1779
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:29,428
Kwang Soo.

1780
01:05:29,695 --> 01:05:31,564
You want to go on a trip with Kwang Soo?

1781
01:05:31,564 --> 01:05:34,934
We became friends after filming last time.

1782
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:38,171
I think I'll feel comfortable,

1783
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,573
and I can order him around.

1784
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,807
She's going to make you do stuff.

1785
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,476
- She'll order you around. - I think it'll be fun.

1786
01:05:43,476 --> 01:05:45,077
I'm comfortable with him.

1787
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:46,979
Which member I don't want to go with?

1788
01:05:46,979 --> 01:05:51,884
(Whom does she not want to go with?)

1789
01:05:51,884 --> 01:05:53,586
(Se Chan)

1790
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:54,987
- Why did you pick him? - She doesn't like you.

1791
01:05:54,987 --> 01:05:58,157
Why doesn't she like me? Did I do something wrong?

1792
01:05:58,524 --> 01:05:59,759
(You didn't.)

1793
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:01,027
- Let's hear it. - Se Chan?

1794
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,229
It's Se Chan.

1795
01:06:03,262 --> 01:06:07,433
When I came on the show last time, he wasn't too happy.

1796
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:10,169
Let me change this.

1797
01:06:10,169 --> 01:06:12,705
I think I like Seok Jin less than Se Chan.

1798
01:06:12,705 --> 01:06:14,473
I feel like I have to take care of him.

1799
01:06:14,574 --> 01:06:16,409
(This is an intense battle now.)

1800
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:17,843
Why did she change her mind?

1801
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:19,445
- This is intense. - He got two votes.

1802
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,014
(Why don't you like me?)

1803
01:06:22,014 --> 01:06:23,082
I think I like Seok Jin less.

1804
01:06:23,082 --> 01:06:25,418
I feel like I have to take care of him.

1805
01:06:25,418 --> 01:06:26,519
That's tiring.

1806
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:29,088
I think he'll keep nagging.

1807
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:30,923
I pick Seok Jin.

1808
01:06:32,024 --> 01:06:35,528
"If you have a chance, which tour package would you go on?"

1809
01:06:35,528 --> 01:06:36,696
(What's all this?)

1810
01:06:36,696 --> 01:06:38,130
- Really? - Yes?

1811
01:06:39,198 --> 01:06:41,234
Is it exactly like the picture?

1812
01:06:41,234 --> 01:06:42,868
Yes, that's what we found.

1813
01:06:43,736 --> 01:06:48,307
"If you have a chance, which tour package would you go on?"

1814
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:50,076
Where is that?

1815
01:06:50,576 --> 01:06:52,278
It's New Zealand.

1816
01:06:54,313 --> 01:06:55,948
- That's Canada. - That's amazing.

1817
01:06:55,948 --> 01:06:57,116
(8 destinations of Luxury Package were selected carefully.)

1818
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:58,184
There are so many nice places.

1819
01:06:58,184 --> 01:07:00,086
(8 destinations of Luxury Package were selected carefully.)

1820
01:07:00,086 --> 01:07:01,854
- This is great. - I would love to go.

1821
01:07:01,854 --> 01:07:03,990
(We really want to go on the trip.)

1822
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:07,526
(What did the new family choose?)

1823
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:10,029
I want to go to Spain.

1824
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,265
There's a hotel package...

1825
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:15,534
you have to go on before you die, selected by BBC.

1826
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:17,670
You have to go before you die,

1827
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,572
so it feels like...

1828
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:21,807
you have to go right at this moment.

1829
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:26,979
(FC Barcelona)

1830
01:07:26,979 --> 01:07:29,982
(It's a famous Spanish soccer club everybody knows.)

1831
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:34,086
(We have to see that.)

1832
01:07:34,086 --> 01:07:35,388
Messi.

1833
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:37,723

1834
01:07:37,723 --> 01:07:39,225
Barcelona.

1835
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:41,994
(Real Madrid is Barcelona's eternal rival.)

1836
01:07:41,994 --> 01:07:43,496
Do we get to watch El Clasico?

1837
01:07:43,596 --> 01:07:46,232
- Do we get to watch that? - That would be awesome.

1838
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:50,236
(The oldest restaurant in the world is in Spain?)

1839
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:51,704
(This traditional Spanish restaurant was Ernest Hemingway's favorite.)

1840
01:07:51,704 --> 01:07:53,739
I feel motivated now. I want to go there.

1841
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:55,141
It's so nice.

You get to spend time in the fortress.

1846
01:08:02,915 --> 01:08:04,317
Look at the swimming pool.

1847
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,118
Isn't it so nice?

1848
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,321
It's so nice. I mean it.

1849
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:10,156

(Take a bath in the hot spring?)

1854

They have the hot spring in a cave?

1855
01:08:26,505 --> 01:08:28,240
Mexico is great.

1856
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:30,376
That's awesome.

Canada?

1867
01:08:54,934 --> 01:08:57,069
(This river in the Rocky Mountains is a must-see in 2018.)

I really want to go to Canada.

1869

1871
01:09:01,807 --> 01:09:03,676
- You know it, right? - I've seen that in movies.

1872
01:09:03,676 --> 01:09:05,711
I wanted to do that.

It has a great scenery.

- I think you are. - We have to go there.

01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:34,600
It doesn't matter if it's Australia or Canada.

1910
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,769
It can even be Thailand because it's close.

1911
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:40,072
The fact that you're on a plane to somewhere is nice.

See?

1920
01:11:02,127 --> 01:11:03,762
These are the bad ones.

1921
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:06,532
See? That's the swing.

1922
01:11:06,532 --> 01:11:10,336

1935
01:11:44,303 --> 01:11:45,437
What's that?

1936
01:11:45,437 --> 01:11:46,839
(You can't spin it around.)

1937
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,941
They must be crazy.

1938
01:11:48,941 --> 01:11:50,175
(This plane leads you to...)

1939
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:53,512
(a hotel where the sleepless souls visit every night.)

1940
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:55,114
What's this now?

1941
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:56,916
You'll get possessed.

1942
01:11:56,916 --> 01:11:59,084
Goodness. Don't do this.

1943
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:00,886
Oh, gosh.

1944
01:12:00,886 --> 01:12:02,388
- No... - Turn it off, So Min.

1945
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:04,256
- The ghost... - Turn it off. Kick it.

1946
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:06,325
Hey.

1947
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:07,927
Thanks. You did it for me.

1948
01:12:07,927 --> 01:12:10,863
- Casper is a ghost. - Goodness.

1949
01:12:10,863 --> 01:12:12,298
Casper is cute.

1950
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:14,600
Giant Canyon Swing.

1951
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:17,069
Wasn't Haha supposed to do this?

1952
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:18,837
- But he couldn't go, right? - Right.

1953
01:12:18,837 --> 01:12:20,773
He can do this then.

1954
01:12:20,773 --> 01:12:21,941
America.

1955
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:27,746
(Did you think you were safe? The terrifying swing is back.)

1956
01:12:27,746 --> 01:12:29,114
That's the swing.

1957
01:12:29,114 --> 01:12:30,282
We were supposed to go there.

1958
01:12:30,282 --> 01:12:33,185
You can go there. You were supposed to do it.

1959
01:12:33,185 --> 01:12:34,553
(I almost forgot about it.)

1960
01:12:34,587 --> 01:12:35,754
Look.

1961
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:38,324
(The designer was too scared and only went on it once.)

1962
01:12:38,324 --> 01:12:39,658
This is unbelievable.

1963
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:40,726
It's insane.

1964
01:12:40,726 --> 01:12:45,130
(Giant Canyon Swing throws you 400m above the ground.)

1965
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,666
(After that, you get to sleep 6m below the ground.)

1966
01:12:48,534 --> 01:12:51,036
Why is there a hotel 6m below the ground?

1967
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:52,838
We have to sleep there?

1968
01:12:53,138 --> 01:12:54,506
You have to swim to it.

1969
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:55,874
It's an underwater hotel?

1970
01:12:56,008 --> 01:12:57,977
You have to swim to your room.

1971
01:12:58,544 --> 01:13:02,247
(In the underwater hotel in Florida, you can spend a breathless night.)

1972
01:13:02,247 --> 01:13:03,582
Switzerland.

1973
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:06,118
There's so much. Do you get to do everything?

1974
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:07,853
It won't be me anyways.

1975
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,158
What's this?

1976
01:13:13,158 --> 01:13:14,460
A suspension bridge.

1977
01:13:15,194 --> 01:13:18,030
- I can't do that. - You have to risk your life.

1978
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,932
My goodness.

1979
01:13:19,932 --> 01:13:21,433
(Canyoning involves swimming, rock climbing, and hiking.)

1980
01:13:21,433 --> 01:13:22,468
You have to jump down?

1981
01:13:22,468 --> 01:13:24,269
(Canyoning involves swimming, rock climbing, and hiking.)

1982
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:27,906
(You get to free jump from a gondola that's 134m tall...)

1983
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:28,974
(in a cable car bungee jumping.)

1984
01:13:28,974 --> 01:13:30,476
You must be insane.

1985
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:37,916
(There's a single bed in the middle of the Alps?)

1986
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:39,852
Why would you sleep there?

1987
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:42,221
(There's an Alps outdoor hotel with no walls, roof, or bathroom.)

1988
01:13:42,354 --> 01:13:45,624
It looks different on the screen.

1989
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:48,260
Does this mean...

1990
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,596
you have to climb the cliff?

1991
01:13:50,596 --> 01:13:51,730
That's right.

1992
01:13:52,431 --> 01:13:53,632
Peru.

1993
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:59,071
(Why are there capsules on the cliff?)

1994
01:13:59,071 --> 01:14:01,373
- Oh, my. - Do you have to rock climb?

1995
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:02,408
(The hotel is suspended 122m. You have to rock climb to check in.)

1996
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:03,809
Why is that necessary?

1997
01:14:03,809 --> 01:14:06,412
(You can spend a cozy night in the cliff-side hotel.)

1998
01:14:06,412 --> 01:14:09,748
Are you ready?

1999
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:11,684
What's this?

2000
01:14:15,087 --> 01:14:18,190
(What just happened?)

2001
01:14:20,426 --> 01:14:21,894
(It only takes 5 seconds to be launched 125m in the air.)

2002
01:14:21,894 --> 01:14:24,730
- How high is that? - That's Superman.

2003
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:27,232
(The deadly Cusco slingshot allows you to dangle from a cord.)

2004
01:14:31,503 --> 01:14:33,672
(They're speechless.)

2005
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:36,075
We thought we were done after the Nevis Swing.

2006
01:14:36,175 --> 01:14:38,811
Where do you get all the information from?

2007
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:41,914
You won't know when you are there, but once you get up,

2008
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:44,283
the ghost will be stuck to your luggage.

2009
01:14:44,283 --> 01:14:47,186
(That's if you go to the haunted hotel in the UK.)

2010
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:49,455
It'll turn Korea into chaos.

2011
01:14:49,455 --> 01:14:50,856
Really?

2012
01:14:50,856 --> 01:14:52,825
- Why would you say that? - It really happened.

2013
01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:55,160
What's this?

2014
01:14:55,227 --> 01:14:57,129
Why would you bring this?

2015
01:14:57,129 --> 01:15:00,666
This? No way.

2016
01:15:01,333 --> 01:15:03,936
(It's the roulette again.)

2017
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,504
(There are actually 2.)

2018
01:15:05,504 --> 01:15:07,639
That's how they went to the Nevis Swing last time.

2019
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:09,341
- This is not right. - Did you see it?

2020
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:10,442
Did you see the Nevis Swing?

2021
01:15:10,442 --> 01:15:13,345
- I really don't want to do this. - I can't go on the plane.

2022
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:14,413
Why?

2023
01:15:14,413 --> 01:15:16,448
We're going to be serious...

2024
01:15:16,448 --> 01:15:19,218
and pick the luxury one.

2025
01:15:19,351 --> 01:15:21,954
- I want to go to Switzerland. - We have to go to these places.

2026
01:15:21,954 --> 01:15:24,356
- Me too. - Anyway,

2027
01:15:24,356 --> 01:15:26,692
the new family members filled out questionnaires...

2028
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:28,494
and picked the destinations they wouldn't go to.

2029
01:15:28,494 --> 01:15:31,096
- We have all the packages here. - Okay.

2030
01:15:31,096 --> 01:15:34,032
These are the four destinations...

2031
01:15:34,032 --> 01:15:35,300
you chose.

2032
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,171
You can't say that they chose these places.

2033
01:15:39,171 --> 01:15:40,906
Do you really think...

2034
01:15:40,906 --> 01:15:42,508
they picked these places?

2035
01:15:42,508 --> 01:15:44,009
This is really bad.

2036
01:15:44,143 --> 01:15:46,578
They picked 4 out of 8.

2037
01:15:46,578 --> 01:15:47,613
(He's adamant.)

2038
01:15:47,613 --> 01:15:52,417
(They didn't feel the pressure because it was for somebody else.)

2039
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:55,954
(These choices became the proposed sites.)

2040
01:15:56,121 --> 01:15:58,490
(It won't be me anyways.)

2041
01:15:58,657 --> 01:16:01,193
They said it's for somebody else, not us.

2042
01:16:01,193 --> 01:16:02,594
- Is that why? - I wanted to see it.

2043
01:16:02,594 --> 01:16:04,329
- You'll end up doing it. - It'll be you.

2044
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:06,231
That's why I chose it.

2045
01:16:06,231 --> 01:16:08,267
There are so many nice places.

2046
01:16:08,267 --> 01:16:10,202
We can win and go there.

2047
01:16:10,202 --> 01:16:12,638
- Do you think it's possible? - We'll make it possible.

2048
01:16:12,638 --> 01:16:14,139
- We have to. - Of course.

2049
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:16,141
The family project...

2050
01:16:16,141 --> 01:16:17,709
that involves 12 members...

2051
01:16:17,709 --> 01:16:19,478
will run for four weeks.

2052
01:16:19,478 --> 01:16:21,413
The winning team each week...

2053
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:23,949
can stick their name tags on the Luxury Package roulette.

2054
01:16:24,616 --> 01:16:27,653
The losing team will have their name tags...

2055
01:16:27,653 --> 01:16:29,021
on the Shuddering Package roulette.

2056
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:32,157
(6 losers each week will have their name tags on the roulette.)

2057
01:16:32,157 --> 01:16:34,193
During the last week, we'll spin the roulette...

2058
01:16:34,193 --> 01:16:35,828
decide the destination and the members.

2059
01:16:35,828 --> 01:16:38,430
You'll be going on package tours to the different countries.

2060
01:16:38,864 --> 01:16:42,434
(Shuddering Package vs Luxury Package)

2061
01:16:42,568 --> 01:16:44,203
So half...

2062
01:16:44,203 --> 01:16:45,637
of us are going.

2063
01:16:45,637 --> 01:16:47,039
- Half of us are going? - I can already see...

2064
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:49,007
- whose names will be on here. - Right?

2065
01:16:49,141 --> 01:16:50,709
Me too.

2066
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:53,178
As soon as I heard "six people", I looked at Jae Seok.

2067
01:16:53,178 --> 01:16:54,813
I know who's going.

2068
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:56,648
You know what's funny?

2069
01:16:56,648 --> 01:16:59,718
We looked at each other when this roulette came out.

2070
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,220
We made eye contact.

2071
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,721
I don't know why.

2072
01:17:05,257 --> 01:17:07,359
(Kwang Soo)

2073
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:09,027
(Jae Seok)

2074
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:13,999
(Are we all thinking the same?)

2075
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,434
I don't know why,

2076
01:17:15,434 --> 01:17:17,102
but my eyes turned to you like magnets.

2077
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:19,338
If Sang Yeob and Da Hee come here...

2078
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:21,506
and Seok Jin and I go there,

2079
01:17:21,506 --> 01:17:23,809
- we're the favorites to lose. - That's true.

2080
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:25,677
- You are the losers. - That's so true.

2081
01:17:25,677 --> 01:17:27,846
We have bad luck,

2082
01:17:27,846 --> 01:17:29,514
but we have these four,

2083
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:30,883
- so you never know. - You don't.

2084
01:17:30,883 --> 01:17:34,052
According to probability, 2 of them will join us.

2085
01:17:34,052 --> 01:17:35,888
That's true. That's for sure.

2086
01:17:35,888 --> 01:17:38,390
What do you think, Jin Young?

2087
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:42,060
I like the Giant Canyon Swing the least.

2088
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,395
This?

2089
01:17:43,395 --> 01:17:47,299
(She chose it without thinking much.)

2090
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:50,836
But I heard Haha was supposed to go there,

2091
01:17:50,836 --> 01:17:54,806
so I think he should go.

2092
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:57,242
- You should go. - That's at least better.

2093
01:17:57,643 --> 01:17:58,844
- I've been... - It's better.

2094
01:17:58,844 --> 01:18:00,846
- on the Nevis Swing. - You've done it before.

2095
01:18:01,179 --> 01:18:02,848
- You've been on the Nevis Swing. - Number 26.

2096
01:18:02,848 --> 01:18:05,250
Number 27.

2097
01:18:05,517 --> 01:18:07,052
- Hey. - Crocodile.

2098
01:18:07,286 --> 01:18:08,687
- Crocodile. - Crocodile.

2099
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:10,422
- Crocodile. - Crocodile.

2100
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:12,858
That's nice.

2101
01:18:13,158 --> 01:18:14,993
There's a high chance...

2102
01:18:14,993 --> 01:18:17,195
Sang Yeob will go here.

2103
01:18:17,195 --> 01:18:18,630
- Me? - Yes.

2104
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:19,831
I think Sang Yeob...

2105
01:18:19,831 --> 01:18:22,367
might go because of Kwang Soo, not himself.

2106
01:18:22,401 --> 01:18:23,869
I'm here today...

2107
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:26,271
because I want to send Kwang Soo here and go on the luxury tour.

2108
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:28,573
- Really? - I think you're in the same team.

2109
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:31,076
You'll both get step counters.

2110
01:18:31,343 --> 01:18:33,011
You'll do the wing walking with the step counters on.

2111
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:35,147
I'll be shaking the step counter the whole time.

2112
01:18:35,314 --> 01:18:39,985
(They'll fight and both end up in the Shuddering Package.)

2113
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,454
I can't say I won't be going there,

2114
01:18:42,454 --> 01:18:44,256
but I swear if I do go, I'll take you with me.

2115
01:18:44,256 --> 01:18:46,858
Exactly. He'll do that.

2116
01:18:46,925 --> 01:18:48,393
You might go because of Kwang Soo.

2117
01:18:48,393 --> 01:18:50,028
And Jae Seok.

2118
01:18:50,028 --> 01:18:51,930
(Why are you playing dumb, Jae Seok?)

2119
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,799
I finished speaking...

2120
01:18:53,799 --> 01:18:55,067
and turned away.

2121
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,535
- Why are you bringing me into this? - I was hurt.

2122
01:18:56,535 --> 01:18:58,203
I thought you would do that,

2123
01:18:58,203 --> 01:18:59,471
so I turned away.

2124
01:18:59,471 --> 01:19:01,073
(They have strong ties. They never die alone.)

2125
01:19:01,073 --> 01:19:03,742
The first part of the project is...

2126
01:19:03,742 --> 01:19:06,178
Romance Goes Away.

2127
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:07,846
(Family Package Project: Romance Goes Away)

2128
01:19:08,313 --> 01:19:09,514
Romance?

2129
01:19:09,982 --> 01:19:11,316
It goes away?

2130
01:19:11,550 --> 01:19:14,720
You are in Jinhae that's known for the cherry blossoms,

2131
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,488
so we prepared a couples' race.

2132
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:19,091
Unfortunately, we have five female members...

2133
01:19:19,257 --> 01:19:21,326
and seven male members.

2134
01:19:21,593 --> 01:19:23,462
Five teams will be female and male couples,

2135
01:19:23,462 --> 01:19:26,732
and one team will be a bromance couple for the races.

2136
01:19:27,733 --> 01:19:29,267
- We have to win. - It's a male couple.

2137
01:19:29,267 --> 01:19:31,737
I'll have to try so hard for four weeks.

2138
01:19:31,903 --> 01:19:34,206
So this is the important part.

2139
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:36,208
The couple selection mission is called...

2140
01:19:36,241 --> 01:19:38,410
As Long As It's Not You.

2141
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:40,045
(Couple selection mission: As Long As It's Not You)

2142
01:19:40,712 --> 01:19:42,180
"As Long As It's Not You".

2143
01:19:42,347 --> 01:19:43,849
"As Long As It's Not You".

2144
01:19:44,349 --> 01:19:48,053
The female members will choose one male member they don't like...

2145
01:19:48,053 --> 01:19:50,689
and compete in a game they choose.

2146
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:52,958
If she wins,

2147
01:19:52,958 --> 01:19:54,059
she can become a couple with the member she wants.

2148
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:57,863
If she loses, she becomes a couple with the male member she chooses.

2149
01:19:57,863 --> 01:20:02,067
(If she wins, she can pick her partner.)

2150
01:20:02,067 --> 01:20:04,803
You have to be smart about whom you choose.

2151
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:07,005
- That's right. - This is insane.

2152
01:20:07,372 --> 01:20:09,975
If you object to the couple selection process,

2153
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:12,978
you can bring it up and play the game.

2154
01:20:12,978 --> 01:20:16,381
If you win, you can steal the loser's partner.

2155
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:20,052
(If you win, you can steal somebody else's partner.)

2156
01:20:20,052 --> 01:20:21,420
You can steal a partner? Oh, dear.

2157
01:20:22,454 --> 01:20:24,723
- The teams are really important. - This depends...

2158
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:26,992
on the teams.

2159
01:20:26,992 --> 01:20:29,795
- The results will depend on this. - Everything depends on this.

2160
01:20:29,795 --> 01:20:32,531
The teams are important, but it's all fate.

2161
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:35,333
(Winning and losing depend on fate.)

2162
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,902
He's ruining this for us.

2163
01:20:36,902 --> 01:20:39,071
- You might try hard. - I am disappointed already.

2164
01:20:39,071 --> 01:20:40,939
There's fortune for each day.

2165
01:20:40,939 --> 01:20:42,541
That was so sensible of you.

2166
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:44,943
(My Jong Kook)

2167
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:46,678
(Smiling)

2168
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:48,346
- That was sensible? - Of course.

2169
01:20:48,346 --> 01:20:49,981
He looks happy. He got complimented.

2170
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:51,249
He's flaring his nostrils.

2171
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:53,685
If you keep doing that, you'll tire him out.

2172
01:20:53,752 --> 01:20:55,087
Keep doing it.

2173
01:20:55,087 --> 01:20:57,856
First of all, let's pick...

2174
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,224
one person to play.

2175
01:20:59,224 --> 01:21:01,193
- Let's start with So Min. - So Min.

2176
01:21:01,193 --> 01:21:02,494
Let's go, So Min.

2177
01:21:02,494 --> 01:21:04,629
- Doesn't she usually win? - She's intense.

2178
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:06,531
What did she choose?

2179
01:21:06,665 --> 01:21:08,867
Pinching with my toes.

2180
01:21:09,367 --> 01:21:12,404
(Pinching with toes)

2181
01:21:12,404 --> 01:21:13,505
- What do you do? - Pinching?

2182
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:14,573
(What's that?)

2183
01:21:14,573 --> 01:21:16,374
Do you lose if your skin rips?

2184
01:21:16,374 --> 01:21:18,510
(Do you pinch somebody and lose if their skin rips?)

2185
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:19,911
Do you lose if you bleed out?

2186
01:21:19,911 --> 01:21:22,747
I know she can move her toes freely.

2187
01:21:22,747 --> 01:21:24,683
- My toes are long, - She's good at pinching things.

2188
01:21:24,683 --> 01:21:26,718
so they're pretty strong.

2189
01:21:26,718 --> 01:21:28,420
If you don't make any sound, you win.

2190
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,856
- If you make any sound, I win. - For 10 seconds.

2191
01:21:30,856 --> 01:21:32,157
For 10 seconds?

2192
01:21:32,157 --> 01:21:33,258
Hold on.

2193
01:21:33,258 --> 01:21:35,861
That's simple. I think anybody can hold it.

2194
01:21:35,861 --> 01:21:39,331
But I'll pinch your face.

2195
01:21:39,631 --> 01:21:41,032
With your toes?

2196
01:21:41,533 --> 01:21:43,602
(That's something she would do.)

2197
01:21:43,602 --> 01:21:45,170
I'm sorry, but you'll be doing this?

2198
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,471
Like this?

2199
01:21:46,471 --> 01:21:47,939
It's 10 seconds.

2200
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,510
So Min, whom will you pick?

2201
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:56,481
(Who does So Min not want to be a couple with?)

2202
01:21:56,848 --> 01:21:58,416
(So Min's As Long As It's Not You)

2203
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,953
Se Chan, as long as it's not you.

2204
01:22:01,953 --> 01:22:03,155
Why all of a sudden?

2205
01:22:03,155 --> 01:22:05,223
If I don't make any sound, you'll become a couple with me.

2206
01:22:05,457 --> 01:22:06,992
You can't hold it.

2207
01:22:07,259 --> 01:22:08,593
- Really? - Really?

2208
01:22:08,593 --> 01:22:09,594
(Se Chan vs So Min)

2209
01:22:09,594 --> 01:22:11,196
I'm really good at this.

2210
01:22:11,196 --> 01:22:13,765
- You are? - Should I take my jacket off?

2211
01:22:13,765 --> 01:22:15,233
It doesn't matter.

2212
01:22:15,367 --> 01:22:18,970
(She beats her foot like a middle-aged man.)

2213
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,805
Please give me wet tissue.

2214
01:22:21,106 --> 01:22:24,109
- She has good manners. - Will she wipe her foot?

2215
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:26,611
She might wipe Se Chan's face.

2216
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:30,482
(She might wipe Se Chan's face with wet tissue.)

2217
01:22:30,549 --> 01:22:32,617
It will be a surprise if she wipes Se Chan's face.

2218
01:22:33,084 --> 01:22:34,519
That will be a twist.

2219
01:22:34,519 --> 01:22:37,088
My face is cleaner than your foot!

2220
01:22:37,088 --> 01:22:40,125
She might leave her foot be and wipe Se Chan's face.

2221
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,126
(Fortunately, she wipes her toes.)

2222
01:22:41,126 --> 01:22:42,894
So Min, your toes are so long.

2223
01:22:42,894 --> 01:22:43,962
She will be able to pinch freely.

2224
01:22:43,962 --> 01:22:46,131
- I am self-conscious of them. - I see.

2225
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:47,566
I can pull up my big toe.

2226
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:50,302
(She can pull up her big toe.)

2227
01:22:50,569 --> 01:22:52,337
I bet she can play piano with her toes.

2228
01:22:52,804 --> 01:22:54,839
She picked up her item at doljabi with her toes.

2229
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,408
I can shake your hand with them.

2230
01:22:56,408 --> 01:22:59,010
(Isn't it amazing?)

2231
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:00,579
Is this really a game?

2232
01:23:01,112 --> 01:23:03,415
She can shake my hand with her toes.

2233
01:23:03,415 --> 01:23:05,183
Her foot is like her hand.

2234
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,586
What will she do if I hold out?

2235
01:23:07,619 --> 01:23:09,988
If you hold out,

2236
01:23:09,988 --> 01:23:15,560
someone will say, "So Min is mine."

2237
01:23:16,328 --> 01:23:17,462
What?

2238
01:23:18,129 --> 01:23:20,565
I think you watched too many dramas.

2239
01:23:20,565 --> 01:23:23,435
- I am sorry, - She looked at Sang Yeob.

2240
01:23:23,435 --> 01:23:26,805
but we are only playing this game for a day.

2241
01:23:26,805 --> 01:23:28,273
(Sang Yeob, come to my aid.)

2242
01:23:29,241 --> 01:23:31,343
Get ready. Where will you pinch him?

2243
01:23:31,343 --> 01:23:33,144
- Where should I pinch you? - You can pinch hard.

2244
01:23:33,144 --> 01:23:34,980
- Where will you pinch me? - I will pinch your ear.

2245
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,348
- I think it's a nice choice. - Ears don't hurt.

2246
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:37,449
- Ears don't hurt. - They don't?

2247
01:23:37,449 --> 01:23:39,017
- No. - Ears don't hurt.

2248
01:23:39,117 --> 01:23:40,452
- There? - Try it.

2249
01:23:40,452 --> 01:23:41,886
(She reaches for his ear as if she is ready to rip it out.)

2250
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:45,957
(Screaming)

2251
01:23:45,957 --> 01:23:47,859
- What was that? - I have a cramp.

2252
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,861
- Are you okay? - What was that?

2253
01:23:50,495 --> 01:23:54,065
(She complains about the pain due to a cramp in her toes.)

2254
01:23:54,065 --> 01:23:55,233
What's wrong?

2255
01:23:55,233 --> 01:23:56,534
- Just now, - Are you okay?

2256
01:23:56,534 --> 01:23:58,303
she pushed me with her foot when she couldn't punch my ear.

2257
01:23:58,303 --> 01:24:01,039
- So Min, don't do that. - I have a cramp.

2258
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:02,040
- Are you okay? - Yes.

2259
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,142
I will massage your toes.

2260
01:24:04,142 --> 01:24:05,610
All right.

2261
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:08,446
- So Min, are you toes okay? - Yes.

2262
01:24:08,446 --> 01:24:09,614
They are dangling.

2263
01:24:10,048 --> 01:24:12,550
They are dangling too much. Are your toes okay?

2264
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:14,085
Yes. Se Chan's makeup was slippery.

2265
01:24:14,085 --> 01:24:15,854
Are your toes okay?

2266
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:17,856
- Pinch his neck. - There isn't much to grab.

2267
01:24:17,856 --> 01:24:19,791
- It's a nice choice. - Pinch his neck.

2268
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:21,693
It will hurt. He is bound to make a sound.

2269
01:24:21,693 --> 01:24:23,061
It will hurt.

2270
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:27,832
(I never make the same mistake twice.)

2271
01:24:27,832 --> 01:24:31,303
(I am determined to end this with a single shot.)

2272
01:24:32,137 --> 01:24:33,238
My goodness.

2273
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:36,107
(She gets a cramp again.)

2274
01:24:36,107 --> 01:24:37,542
- If this keeps going on... - For goodness' sake.

2275
01:24:37,542 --> 01:24:40,578
This player isn't ready, Jae Seok.

2276
01:24:40,578 --> 01:24:42,380
This player isn't ready.

2277
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,749
What are we supposed to do if she continues having cramps?

2278
01:24:44,749 --> 01:24:47,085
- Are you putting on a show? - What are we supposed to do?

2279
01:24:47,085 --> 01:24:50,088
Gosh, my toes became twisted.

2280
01:24:50,121 --> 01:24:52,657
- Do you have a certificate? - When I learned ballet...

2281
01:24:52,657 --> 01:24:54,592
(You are good at this.)

2282
01:24:54,592 --> 01:24:57,028
- I got a lot of cramps. - Doesn't she look like a nurse?

2283
01:24:57,028 --> 01:24:58,697
She looks like a nurse.

2284
01:24:58,697 --> 01:25:00,865
Han Na learned ballet.

2285
01:25:00,865 --> 01:25:02,634
When you have a cramp. you need to push your toes back.

2286
01:25:02,634 --> 01:25:05,370
Your toes might be stronger, big sister.

2287
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:09,040
Am I older than you? You called me big sister.

2288
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:11,676
- She does that to everyone. - I don't know how old you are.

2289
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:13,745
She says that to people who are five years younger than her.

2290
01:25:13,745 --> 01:25:15,814
In which year were you born? I was born in 1989.

2291
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:17,048
- 1988? - 1989.

2292
01:25:17,048 --> 01:25:19,351
1989? I am sorry.

2293
01:25:19,551 --> 01:25:21,052
They don't hurt anymore, right?

2294
01:25:21,052 --> 01:25:22,053
Thank you.

2295
01:25:22,053 --> 01:25:25,290
I think feeling nervous...

2296
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:28,126
- is putting a strain on her body. - It's because she didn't warm up.

2297
01:25:28,126 --> 01:25:30,628
Please be understanding if she pinches with her fingers.

2298
01:25:30,628 --> 01:25:32,731
(Come on, Se Chan.)

2299
01:25:32,731 --> 01:25:34,099
Why?

2300
01:25:34,099 --> 01:25:35,633
- She can't pinch with her toes. - Excuse me.

2301
01:25:35,633 --> 01:25:37,001
- Her fingers? - That's right.

2302
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:39,170
He is bound to feel pain if he gets pinched by her fingers.

2303
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:41,539
- Why doesn't she punch him instead? - Seriously.

2304
01:25:41,539 --> 01:25:43,375
Why doesn't she hit him with a bat?

2305
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,442
You shouldn't change a rule so suddenly.

2306
01:25:44,442 --> 01:25:46,511
- Please calm down. - Kick him in the calves.

2307
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:47,979
Come on.

2308
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:49,647
- I will get started. - The skin is thin here.

2309
01:25:49,647 --> 01:25:51,516
- It turned red. - It's okay.

2310
01:25:51,516 --> 01:25:53,284
(Se Chan's neck)

2311
01:25:53,284 --> 01:25:56,388
It's okay. His skin turns red when you rub on it.

2312
01:25:56,388 --> 01:25:57,922
Of course, it turns red...

2313
01:25:57,922 --> 01:25:59,057
when you rub so forcibly.

2314
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:01,292
What is wrong with you?

2315
01:26:01,292 --> 01:26:03,261
You rubbed so forcibly.

2316
01:26:03,261 --> 01:26:05,597
Back off. For goodness' sake.

2317
01:26:05,597 --> 01:26:07,332
- Are your toes okay? - Yes.

2318
01:26:07,332 --> 01:26:09,501
- Se Chan. - It's okay.

2319
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:12,704
You won't get a cramp this way.

2320
01:26:12,704 --> 01:26:15,807
(I feel bad for Se Chan.)

2321
01:26:15,807 --> 01:26:16,875
This way...

2322
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,243
Pull his sideburns.

2323
01:26:18,243 --> 01:26:20,545
Don't you think you made yourself too comfortable?

2324
01:26:20,545 --> 01:26:22,247
(She uses him as a foot stool.)

2325
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:23,748
Don't you think you made yourself too comfortable?

2326
01:26:23,748 --> 01:26:25,817
I am sorry,

2327
01:26:25,817 --> 01:26:27,385
but you have a lot of dead skin on your foot.

2328
01:26:27,385 --> 01:26:29,154
(He notices it.)

2329
01:26:29,154 --> 01:26:32,390
It's because I used a pack.

2330
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:33,858
You have a lot of dead skin.

2331
01:26:33,858 --> 01:26:35,894
Why do you have so much dead skin?

2332
01:26:35,894 --> 01:26:37,429
Take proper care of yourself.

2333
01:26:37,429 --> 01:26:39,764
Back off. Back off.

2334
01:26:39,764 --> 01:26:41,266
- She is the worst. - It's because I used a pack.

2335
01:26:41,266 --> 01:26:42,867
I can't believe what I am seeing.

2336
01:26:42,867 --> 01:26:45,003
I used a pack...

2337
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:47,071
that removes dead skin.

2338
01:26:47,071 --> 01:26:49,073
Can I scream after looking at her foot?

2339
01:26:49,174 --> 01:26:50,875
- I can scream. - Stop it.

2340
01:26:51,042 --> 01:26:52,277
Stop it. We need to play the game.

2341
01:26:52,277 --> 01:26:53,978
It's not that I have dead skin.

2342
01:26:54,446 --> 01:26:58,616
The pack makes dead skin fall off a week after you use it.

2343
01:26:58,616 --> 01:27:00,452
- That's why my skin is flaky. - Are you live-streaming?

2344
01:27:00,452 --> 01:27:02,720
Yes. It's not dead skin.

2345
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:05,256
I thought it was the tangerine pith.

2346
01:27:05,256 --> 01:27:07,892
(A witness says it looks like the tangerine pith.)

2347
01:27:07,892 --> 01:27:09,461
We saw it.

2348
01:27:09,527 --> 01:27:10,628
The white part of a tangerine.

2349
01:27:10,628 --> 01:27:13,631
So Min, you don't have to worry since we will blur your foot.

2350
01:27:13,631 --> 01:27:15,733
Do you want to pinch the inside of my arm?

2351
01:27:15,733 --> 01:27:17,135
It will hurt a lot.

2352
01:27:17,135 --> 01:27:19,537
- It will hurt a lot. - He is pulling his skin.

2353
01:27:19,537 --> 01:27:21,139
- Your skin is the softest there. - That's right.

2354
01:27:21,139 --> 01:27:22,907
- It will hurt a lot. - It will hurt a lot.

2355
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:24,075
Let's go.

2356
01:27:24,075 --> 01:27:25,109
- All right. - Set.

2357
01:27:25,109 --> 01:27:28,980
(If Se Chan endures for 10 seconds, he becomes So Min's partner.)

2358
01:27:29,047 --> 01:27:35,053
(Can So Min avoid having Se Chan as her partner?)

2359
01:27:35,053 --> 01:27:39,190
(Screaming)

2360
01:27:39,324 --> 01:27:41,025
- My goodness. - Did it hurt?

2361
01:27:41,426 --> 01:27:43,127
It hurt here. Gosh, it hurt.

2362
01:27:43,127 --> 01:27:46,631
Did it hurt? Se Chan's lips turned white.

2363
01:27:46,631 --> 01:27:48,099
- Her toes are strong. - Her toes are strong.

2364
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:49,934
(His arm turns red after a single pinch.)

2365
01:27:49,934 --> 01:27:52,871
- Her toes are strong. - Her toes are strong.

2366
01:27:52,871 --> 01:27:56,341
Let's get a shot of you getting pinched on the face.

2367
01:27:57,642 --> 01:27:59,344
Let's have So Min pinch you on the cheek.

2368
01:27:59,344 --> 01:28:01,079
(The first one may be too violent to air.)

2369
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:02,180
We want to use a good shot.

2370
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,982
Why don't you let So Min pinch you on the face?

2371
01:28:04,082 --> 01:28:06,150
Did the rules change?

2372
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,919
- Did they? - We never know.

2373
01:28:07,919 --> 01:28:10,021
- All right. - We never know.

2374
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:11,689
We never know.

2375
01:28:12,891 --> 01:28:14,025
Let's go.

2376
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:17,762
- I guess the rules changed. - That's right.

2377
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:19,197
Set.

2378
01:28:19,764 --> 01:28:20,832
Go.

2379
01:28:20,832 --> 01:28:22,033
(So Min begins pinching.)

2380
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:24,602
- I guess it's endurable. - Yes, she can't pinch with force.

2381
01:28:24,602 --> 01:28:27,272
I see. That's enough, So Min. Let's use the one with the arm.

2382
01:28:27,272 --> 01:28:29,140
Is that it?

2383
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:31,109
To make it more interesting,

2384
01:28:31,109 --> 01:28:33,511
why don't I pinch So Min's face with my toes?

2385
01:28:33,511 --> 01:28:36,447
(This isn't very interesting.)

2386
01:28:36,447 --> 01:28:38,049
- You can edit it later. - No.

2387
01:28:38,049 --> 01:28:39,551
Shall we give it a go?

2388
01:28:39,551 --> 01:28:41,085
You can edit it later.

2389
01:28:41,085 --> 01:28:42,520
(The editing techniques must be advanced.)

2390
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,656
- That won't do. - You can edit it later.

2391
01:28:44,656 --> 01:28:46,524
So Min succeeded.

2392
01:28:46,524 --> 01:28:47,959
(She can choose her partner.)

2393
01:28:47,959 --> 01:28:49,060
She succeeded.

2394
01:28:49,761 --> 01:28:51,029
So Min.

2395
01:28:51,029 --> 01:28:52,931
It's hard to choose.

2396
01:28:53,064 --> 01:28:55,233
For your information, male couples can be at a disadvantage.

2397
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:56,601
- Really? - That's what I thought.

2398
01:28:56,601 --> 01:28:59,871
- They are at a disadvantage? - We must avoid it.

2399
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:00,905
I...

2400
01:29:00,905 --> 01:29:02,674
(So Min chooses the lucky partner.)

2401
01:29:02,774 --> 01:29:06,578
(I need a female partner as soon as possible.)

2402
01:29:06,644 --> 01:29:09,514
(What is So Min's choice?)

2403
01:29:09,514 --> 01:29:11,783
I want to partner up with a new face.

2404
01:29:12,383 --> 01:29:13,451
Sang Yeob.

2405
01:29:13,451 --> 01:29:14,953
(Sang Yeob, do you want to be my partner?)

2406
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:20,024
(Can So Min partner up with Sang Yeob?)

2407
01:29:20,024 --> 01:29:21,225
(Next week)

2408
01:29:21,926 --> 01:29:26,564
(Are they flirting with each other?)

2409
01:29:26,864 --> 01:29:29,334
(However)

2410
01:29:29,867 --> 01:29:33,605
(Colorful diamonds tempt the lovers.)

2411
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:36,307
(I really want them.)

2412
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:38,509
(The game starts as soon as they touch the diamonds.)

2413
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:41,412
(The Curse of the Diamond)

2414
01:29:42,246 --> 01:29:45,216
(The greedier they become, the deeper they fall.)

2415
01:29:45,783 --> 01:29:49,053
(Greed makes them lose love and friendship.)

2416
01:29:49,053 --> 01:29:50,755
It's too dangerous.

2417
01:29:50,855 --> 01:29:54,158
(Diamonds bring about...)

2418
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:57,061
(the wild chase of stealing and getting stolen.)

2419
01:29:57,662 --> 01:30:00,498
(Can you withstand the curse?)

2420
01:30:01,265 --> 01:30:04,068
(The Curse of the Diamond)
