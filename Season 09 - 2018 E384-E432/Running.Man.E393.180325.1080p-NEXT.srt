All right, Somin.

74
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,080
It's hard to choose.

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,340
Male couples will be at a disadvantage today.

76
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,680

82
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,860
I want to pair up with a new face.

83
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
It's Sang Yeob.

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,230
(Do you want to be my partner?)

85
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,200
How about becoming the Crazy Couple?

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,900
Crazy Couple. Crazy Somin. Crazy Sang Yeob.

87
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,010
- Crazy Couple. - I'll protect you!

88
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,580
(I will protect you, Somin!)

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,010
No one has said that to me. He's the first.

90
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,080
(No one made my heart flutter.)

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,750
Hey, don't you think we should stop this union?

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,760
- I don't want to pair up with her, - Hanna.

93
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,490
but I just want to stop her from pairing up with him.

94
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,590
It's not that I like Somin. I just don't want you two to pair up.

95
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,100
- He wants to film a drama here. - That line didn't sound right.

96
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,500
- That line made me challenge this. - Hey.

97
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
- I know, right? - That was the worst.

98
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,370
- "I'll protect you." - She likes it.

99
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,370
- Forget about that. - This has never happened before.

100
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,800
This has never happened.

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,740
Somin really likes it.

102
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,210
- Hey. - Are you going to do this?

103
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,380
- Will you do it, Jae Seok? - Do you want to do it?

104
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,580
I would like you to challenge it.

105
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
- He has strong toes. - No.

106
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,580
- Why don't you try that, Haha? - Mine?

107
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,480
- She's really strong. - Haha, don't get involved.

108
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,950
(You're my partner.)

109
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,290
Why don't you two try it?

110
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,720
Are you Ji Hyo's partner?

111
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,120
- He's Ji Hyo's. - He's mine.

112
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm really curious. What do you like about me?

113
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,090
(What's my charm, Ji Hyo?)

114
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,390
- Later. - Why do you like me so much?

115
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,700
- I'll tell you later. - Why is that?

116
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,300
I'm really curious. Aren't you curious?

117
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,370
All right. Sang Yeob and Somin are about to pair up,

118
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,040
- but let me challenge that. - Okay.

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,070
(Jae Seok will challenge the pairing.)

120
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,940
(Don't mess up my love interest.)

121
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,110
It's been ages since you did something nice for the team.

122
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,780
- I will... - I'm very happy about that.

123
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,650
- It's been so long. - I don't care who my partner is,

124
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,450
- but I hate this union. - That's so true.

125
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,380
- Somin is... - This is great.

126
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,390
- Let me try this. - Okay.

127
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,750
But Jae Seok isn't good at enduring pain.

128
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,120
Sang Yeob might be worse than me.

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
- He follows through though. - You bet.

130
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,790
Jae Seok can deliver when he's determined.

131
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,890
He might win, you know.

132
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,600
- By the way, Somin. - Yes?

133
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,470
Go back to your spot. We're not fighting over you.

134
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,130
(Let me emphasize one more time.)

135
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,110
I'm sorry, but I think you got the wrong idea here.

136
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,710
Don't stay in the middle. Get out of the way.

137
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,380
- This isn't for you. - They're not fighting over you.

138
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,380
This has never happened to me.

139
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,110
- It's not because of her charms. - It's my first time.

140
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,280
- She loves this kind of thing. - She does.

141
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,180
She likes to be pursued. I really hate this.

142
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,950
Hey, we're not doing this to win you.

143
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,290
- You have gotten the wrong idea. - Jae Seok, lean your face forward.

144
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,360
- Lean forward. - This isn't to win you over.

145
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,190
- Let's get started. - Pinch this part.

146
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,000
- Okay. - Pinch his cheek first.

147
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,760
I can't move my toes well.

148
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,870
- They're ready. - No, Sang Yeob.

149
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,200
- Get ready. - Get ready.

150
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,140
(Sang Yeob, don't make a sound. You must win by all means.)

151
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,580
(Crazy Sang Yeob promised to protect me.)

152
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,920
(He's my first love interest. I can't lose him.)

153
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,980
Start.

154
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,250
- Hey. - It's over.

155
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,490
(Screaming)

156
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,890
(He screams within 0.1 second and couldn't protect her.)

157
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,120
- Okay! Great. - It's over.

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,890
- Okay. - Hey, it's not that.

159
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,690
- Yes! - We did it.

160
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,760
- Let's do it over. - I thought...

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,130
- That was a clean game. - No, no.

162
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
- We did it. - Listen.

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,370
I screamed because I was trying to get ready.

164
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,740
- You lose when you scream. - Hold on a second.

165
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,000
- You screamed. You lost. - You lost.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,110
Does it mean you and Jae Seok will pair up?

167
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,710
- I have done my job. - Okay.

168
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,010
- All right. - Somin said she's going home.

169
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I did it.

170
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,580
(Somin and Jae Seok will be partners.)

171
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,850
- 1, 2, 3. - It's Da Hee.

172
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,780
I'm okay as long as it's not you, Seok Jin.

173
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,820
(Da Hee goes next.)

174
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,120
- There were no surprises. - There weren't any surprises.

175
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,850
- I knew this would happen. - I will beat you.

176
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,360
Da Hee wins!

177
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,960
I will choose Kwang Soo since no one will challenge to take him.

178
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,230
- Kwang Soo. - Okay.

179
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,230
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee are partners.)

180
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,430
- You make a cute couple. - Cunning Couple.

181
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,970
Next up is Jin Young's challenge of putting on pants quickly.

182
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,330
- Putting on pants quickly. - Let's try it.

183
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,370
(Jong Kook is mine.)

184
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,670
- Jin Young. - Hey, you, Jin Young.

185
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,970
- Hey. - Jin Young only wants Jong Kook.

186
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,610
These two will be partners.

187
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,450
Next up is Ji Hyo.

188
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,820
- Well, Ji Hyo... - All right.

189
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,520
- My talent is... - Okay.

190
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,090
- saying a series of compliments. - I see.

191
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,490
(Ji Hyo's talent is complimenting.)

192
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,930
- Complimenting? - A series of compliments?

193
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,230
You're going to compliment someone?

194
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,360
I found out for the first time today that I had this talent.

195
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,830
- You'll give compliments? - Yes, I'll give compliments.

196
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,830
- You never give compliments. - You don't compliment people.

197
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,670
- Right. - I have never seen you...

198
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,270
- compliment someone. - Ji Hyo.

199
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,770
- Ji Hyo... - First off,

200
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,380
- I will pick... - Which member is it?

201
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,940
(Which member does she not want?)

202
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,850
- Anyone, but you, Haha. - Me? Me?

203
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,880
Really?

204
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,080
- Anyone, but you, Haha. - Me? Me?

205
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,550
(She was pursuing him. What is this sudden change?)

206
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,550
I'll pick anyone, but you, Haha.

207
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,220
- Wait, no. - But you just said that...

208
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,860
- She will lose on purpose. - She's...

209
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
- Right? - No, Seok Jin.

210
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,130
- I'm wrong? - I must do my best.

211
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,130
- If I win, this... - What's going on?

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,730
- What's happening now? - For Ji Hyo's talent,

213
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,300
- you will exchange compliments. - You must take the first shot.

214
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,670
If you get stuck or get angry at the compliments, you will lose.

215
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,040
You will lose if you can't handle the compliments,

216
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,610
get stuck, or can't say a compliment during your turn.

217
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,080
- Okay. - Start.

218
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,210
(If Haha wins, they will be partners.)

219
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,450
You parted your hair nicely today.

220
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you. You look great in hats.

221
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,390
- You look just like your brother. - You have full lips.

222
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,990
The resemblance scares me sometimes.

223
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,560
- You look just like your son. - You're hot-tempered.

224
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,830
- And you are good at cursing. - Haha wins. They will be partners.

225
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,100
I won? I won?

226
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,640
- And you are good at cursing. - Haha wins. They will be partners.

227
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,010
(Hold on. What?)

228
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,580
- I'm so confused. Really? - She couldn't speak.

229
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,180
- She couldn't compliment you. - I'm hot-tempered?

230
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
- Right now, there aren't... - Okay.

231
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,220
- many ladies left. - Hold on.

232
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,950
(He interrupts.)

233
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,390
- Will you challenge it? - I will challenge this.

234
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,750
- All right. - He's going for it.

235
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,550
- I will challenge it too. - Ji Hyo, I will...

236
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,990
(It's been a while since someone pursued Ji Hyo.)

237
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,990
(Sang Yeob delivers his punch line.)

238
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,090
Go on.

239
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,560
I will protect you.

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,100
(He continues to say, "I will protect you.")

241
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,660
- I will protect you. - What?

242
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,900
He is strange.

243
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,700
- Go to Jae Seok! - He is strange.

244
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,900
He is too old-fashioned.

245
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,300
How about me?

246
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,910
- "I will protect you"? - You are too old-fashioned.

247
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,510
What does that even mean?

248
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,980
Why would you protect her?

249
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,010
He is too old-fashioned.

250
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,740
- Each to their own. - He should have been on "X-Man".

251
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,950
- I know. - He has the same repertoire.

252
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,280
This is the repertoire from the 90s.

253
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,050
He would have done well on "X-Man".

254
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,820
Now, this game may not be suitable...

255
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,090
for deciding on the winner.

256
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,390
We need a game with a clear outcome.

257
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,850
Let's play a game with a clear outcome.

258
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,190
Which game could it be?

259
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,390
Should I bring chairs?

260
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,130
- Should I bring chairs? - A game of toe-pinching.

261
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,090
- That's a good idea. - Let's not play that game.

262
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,330
- I will bring the chairs. - Okay. Bring them.

263
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,330
Let's not play that game.

264
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,430
- The thing is, - It's a good game to play.

265
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,830
Sang Yeob is familiar with the game.

266
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,970
(He reveals his toes for the second time today.)

267
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,270
I came up with this game.

268
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,640
- Somin. - I lost, but...

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,510
Partnering up with a woman puts you at an advantage, right?

270
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,110
- That's right. - In that case,

271
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,540
I have no reason not to choose Ji Hyo.

272
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,080
It will be harder to partner up with Hanna.

273
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,580
I have to win this game.

274
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,050
Ji Hyo will be my partner if I win,

275
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,080
- right? - Good luck.

276
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,820
I will bet my life to win.

277
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,520
(Somin prepares wet wipes so that they can wipe their feet.)

278
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,650
I won't wipe my feet.

279
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,420
I won't wipe my feet.

280
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,420
Okay. It's individual freedom.

281
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,890
That's right. It's a matter of personal taste.

282
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,160
Gosh, my feet are sweaty from wearing the boots.

283
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,530
- However, - My goodness.

284
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,070
we need to maintain...

285
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,670
- a modicum of cleanliness. - What will he do?

286
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,470
I, the referee, will wipe his foot lightly.

287
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,910
Okay. Okay.

288
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,910
- Get ready to pinch. - In 1, 2, 3.

289
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,810
Get ready.

290
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,110
- Haha has firm cheeks. - He is ready.

291
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,280
(They have a toe-pinching match to partner up with Ji Hyo.)

292
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,310
His cheek can be grabbed easily.

293
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,880
There we go.

294
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,750
- Get ready. - Hold on. Hold my hand.

295
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,750
Set. Set.

296
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,550
(Their toes are on standby.)

297
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,590
Are male couples at a disadvantage?

298
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,190
(They have a match to avoid becoming a male couple.)

299
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,090
Set. Set, go.

300
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,130
(The match starts.)

301
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,260
Set, go.

302
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,270
(They are desperate from the start.)

303
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,400
- He is enduring pain. - Really?

304
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
(My goodness.)

305
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,510
(Their pinching turns intense.)

306
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,380
Let's try a different area.

307
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,280
I can't believe I am trying so hard.

308
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,880
I can't believe this.

309
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
(They end up holding out for 20 seconds for Ji Hyo.)

310
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,750
I can't believe I am doing this for Ji Hyo.

311
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,050
I am so upset.

312
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,720
I am so upset.

313
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,020
I am so upset.

314
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,160
(It looks like Sang Yeob is capable of enduring pain.)

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,420
He wants to partner up with Ji Hyo.

316
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,060
Earlier, he made a sound right away.

317
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,930
Earlier,

318
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,660
I didn't mean to groan.

319
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,200
You had better be careful.

320
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,130
What did I do?

321
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,740
I will torment you for four weeks.

322
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,440
Show him what you can do!

323
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,410
- Get ready. - I will pinch you here.

324
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,770
Where will you pinch him?

325
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,280
Set, go.

326
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
(Haha aims for the belly while Sang Yeob aims for the thigh.)

327
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,880
(Who has what it takes to protect Ji Hyo?)

328
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,380
Set, go.

329
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,520
He is pinching Haha's thigh.

330
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,490
(It's a neck-and-neck match.)

331
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,860
(Is Ji Hyo worth this kind of effort?)

332
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,020
My goodness.

333
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,360
(Screaming)

334
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,400
(Sang Yeob loses again after enduring a lot of pain.)

335
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,800
Ji Hyo, I will be good.

336
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,170
You are the best.

337
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,470
(Ji Hyo and Haha become a couple.)

338
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,470
Now...

339
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,870
(Sang Yeob walks away.)

340
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,370
Sang Yeob lost all matches.

341
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,480
He had a lot of chances, but...

342
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,780
(He planned to show his manly side...)

343
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,380
(and protect his image as an actor.)

344
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,550
- I will protect you. - He is too old-fashioned.

345
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,190
(His character becomes similar to Seok Jin's.)

346
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,450
- He lost all matches. - I know.

347
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,290
I lost on purpose to turn the tables.

348
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,430
Hanna, please come forward.

349
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,930
- All right. - Sang Yeob, come here.

350
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,760
- Sang Yeob will compete. - The three of us will compete.

351
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,970
Who knew you would be alone until the last round?

352
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,300
Sang Yeob lost all matches today.

353
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,300
Hanna, which game do you choose?

354
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,410
I choose...

355
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,610
the balance game.

356
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,810
(The balance game)

357
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,780
It involves palm-pushing to force your opponent off balance.

358
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,850
Yes.

359
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,950
Please say, "Anyone else but you".

360
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,350
My mind is set.

361
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,090
(Hanna has to choose from the three weakest members.)

362
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,790
(Which member is her least-preferred partner?)

363
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,300
- Jee Seok Jin, anyone else but you. - I just need to win.

364
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,930
I just need to win.

365
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,030
- Yes. He just needs to win. - He just needs to win.

366
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,900
You will have a chance if you win.

367
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,070
I will have a chance if I win. Thank you.

368
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I will win.

369
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,010
This is my chance.

370
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,710
- We have no reason to be happy. - This is my chance.

371
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,010
It will be either one of us.

372
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,180
- Are you ready? - Yes.

373
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,810
- She can balance herself well. - I know.

374
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,210
Hold on.

375
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,480
- All right. - Seok Jin can't stand up.

376
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,590
- Seok Jin. - I need to stand up.

377
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,920
- There you go. - I bet he will lose right away.

378
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,990
- Get ready. Set. - How do I...

379
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,160
Set, go.

380
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,190
(The balance game starts.)

381
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,130
(The fear of losing wipes a smile off her face.)

382
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,330
Hanna is good.

383
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,600
Come on.

384
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,040
(Sang Yeob is desperate.)

385
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,210
(At that moment,)

386
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,610
(Seok Jin loses his balance.)

387
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,110
(Screaming)

388
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,810
Hanna wins!

389
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,110
(She smiles once again.)

390
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
I won.

391
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,680
Seok Jin lost all matches today.

392
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,250
- Hanna. - Yes.

393
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,290
(Seok Jin loses as everyone expected.)

394
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,650
It has been decided...

395
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,420
that Seok Jin will partner up...

396
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,420
- with a male. - No, no.

397
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,690
- No. - It's true.

398
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,690
It's true.

399
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,290
It's over. It has been decided.

400
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,360
Seok Jin.

401
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,930
Your partner will be decided now.

402
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,430
Either Se Chan or Sang Yeob will be Hanna's partner.

403
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,840
Hanna, please pick your partner.

404
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,270
In 1, 2, 3.

405
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,240
(Whom does Hanna want as her partner?)

406
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,680
Sang Yeob.

407
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,710
(She doesn't hesitate.)

408
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,620
(They become a good-looking couple.)

409
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,150
They look good together.

410
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,790
(They look good together.)

411
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,690
I won't allow it. Come on out.

412
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,120
Come on out. I won't allow it.

413
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,160
(Se Chan seeks to defeat Sang Yeob.)

414
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,360
Sang Yeob lost all matches so far.

415
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,460
He was chosen many times, but...

416
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,460
He is really bad at games.

417
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,930
Sang Yeob lost all matches so far.

418
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,370
Sang Yeob.

419
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,370
He isn't really good at anything.

420
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,270
Sang Yeob, I think you will partner up with me.

421
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,040
Sang Yeob was chosen many times,

422
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
but he lost all matches.

423
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,380
If Se Chan wins,

424
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,350
Se Chan and Hanna will be a couple.

425
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,250
Hanna, I will protect you!

426
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,520
(He makes the same promise.)

427
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,790
- I will protect her! - Let's go!

428
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,890
- Let's go! - Let's go.

429
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,790
His style suits the variety shows in the early 2000s.

430
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,120
- "X-Man". - Sang Yeob is bad...

431
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,090
- at games. - "X-Man".

432
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,460
Get ready. Set, go.

433
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,030
(The match starts.)

434
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,630
(His face turns serious.)

435
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,730
- Will Sang Yeob win this time? - He looks cool when he is focused.

436
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,570
(If you win, you become a couple with Hanna.)

437
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,240
(If you lose,)

438
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,640
(you become a couple with Seok Jin.)

439
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,940
(Neither of them wants to lose.)

440
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,410
It will end in an instant.

441
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,180
(He falls into Se Chan's embrace.)

442
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,250
Se Chan won!

443
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,580
For goodness' sake.

444
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,620
(Se Chan and Hanna become a couple.)

445
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,250
Se Chan did it!

446
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,320
(Sang Yeob, I can't believe you.)

447
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,820
Se Chan!

448
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,090
- Se Chan! - Good job!

449
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,760
Se Chan!

450
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,260
- I love it! - Se Chan!

451
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,760
You did a good job.

452
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,560
- You did well. - Let's play three rounds.

453
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,870
Let's play three rounds.

454
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,370
No! This can't be happening.

455
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,170
This is...

456
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,800
He definitely lost.

457
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,070
Why is he...

458
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,780
Why is he on top of me again?

459
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,010
Why?

460
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,410
Se Chan!

461
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,110
I waited a long time.

462
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,580
This is great.

463
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,480
Please say, "Seok Jin, I will protect you."

464
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,250
"Seok Jin, I will protect you."

465
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,720
Seok Jin and Sang Yeob become a couple.

466
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,990
How did this happen?

467
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,190
(The couples)

468
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,930
Let's make an emoji. Look at the camera.

469
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,170
(Shall we make an emoji?)

470
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,570
Earlier...

471
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,570
There you go.

472
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,670
(Laughing)

473
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,670
It's a frog.

474
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,610
It's a frog.

475
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,480
- Does it look like me? - It's a frog.

476
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,540
It's a frog.

477
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,180
Let's choose the skin tone.

478
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,480
- Make it lighter. - Let's make it lighter.

479
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,450
Is it wearing glasses or not?

480
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,820
You can change the glasses.

481
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,990
Oh, my goodness.

482
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,450
I will text it to you.

483
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,660
To me? Okay.

484
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,190
This is fascinating.

485
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,790
- There it is. - There it is.

486
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,300
Seok Jin.

487
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,060
(I envy you for your partner.)

488
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,170
Why would you be envious?

489
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,270
- Don't be envious. - I am envious.

490
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,070
Don't be envious.

491
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,410
All right. All right.

492
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,110
- We make a good couple. - I have you.

493
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,110
Don't they look like they are at a company athletics meeting?

494
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,140
I know.

495
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,010
I brought the head of the department to the company athletics meeting.

496
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,150
The principle and the P.E. teacher.

497
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,490
- Manager Lee. - Yes, sir.

498
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,050
- You're good. - Thank you, sir.

499
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,020
He isn't the head of the department but the founder of the company.

500
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,660
He is old enough to be the founder.

501
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,660
The founder of the company!

502
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,600
I am the president.

503
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,570
Since the couples have been decided,

504
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,400
it's time for the most important part of the race.

505
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,410
You will choose your diamonds in What Are These Diamonds?

506
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,670
What Are These Diamonds?

507
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,970
(What Are These Diamonds)

508
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,740
You will choose your diamonds in What Are These Diamonds?

509
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,340
- Da Hee, it sounds like your name. - You are the heroine,

510
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,410
Da Hee.

511
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,750
She is the heroine of the game.

512
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,950
Each couple will go...

513
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,080
into the diamond room...

514
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,350
and put 1 to 10 diamonds...

515
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,160
in the couple's briefcase.

516
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,830
Decide on the number with your partner,

517
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:56,530
and keep it a secret afterwards.

518
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,170
It's up to us to decide...

519
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,430
how many diamonds we take.

520
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,300
Having a lot of diamonds might be a bad thing.

521
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
You are right.

522
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,740
Let's take turns going into the room.

523
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,440
Jae Seok's couple can go first.

524
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,510
- Us? - Yes.

525
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,610
- Is this the briefcase? - Yes.

526
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,440
Go in and get as many diamonds as you want...

527
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,850
- from 1 to 10. - We need to decide well.

528
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,750
I think Jae Seok and Somin will get five.

529
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,720
Jae Seok will stop Somin from going all out.

530
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,320
- How pretty! - Listen.

531
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,590
There are a lot.

532
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,890
Having a lot of diamonds may be a bad thing.

533
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,760
I don't know if we should get 10 diamonds.

534
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,330
Should we get nine?

535
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,870
(How many diamonds will Jae Seok and Somin get?)

536
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,540
- Here are 5. - Let's get those 5 and...

537
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,350
Your briefcase is heavy.

538
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,550
Seriously.

539
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,050
- I bet you got five diamonds. - Your briefcase is heavy.

540
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,250
I bet you got five diamonds.

541
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,450
As you can see... Excuse me.

542
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,620
I can't believe Da Hee!

543
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,960
To guess the weight, she lifted my arm.

544
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,190
- She's a professional. - I can't believe her.

545
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,560
I bet you got five diamonds.

546
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,330
(Security check, sir)

547
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,030
As you can see... Excuse me.

548
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,100
That was unbelievable.

549
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
- What? - How was it?

550
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,840
I think they took about half.

551
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,880
(Jong Kook and Jin Young enter.)

552
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,010
We're here!

553
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,310
It's not always best to have more.

554
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,080
Let's take about 5 or keep it at lucky 7.

555
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,890
- 5 or 7. - Let's take half.

556
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,720
- Half? - Why seven?

557
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,790
It's a lucky number.

558
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,120
You sound like my grandma.

559
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,690
Hold on.

560
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,430
Only old people say that seven is a lucky number.

561
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,260
- Should we take half? - Yes.

562
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,300
How about three?

563
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,830
- Or... - Because we're in a love triangle?

564
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,900
(They were in a previous episode.)

565
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,770
Sure, we were menaces in a love triangle.

566
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,670
All I want is this one.

567
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,540
- Me too. - It's settled then.

568
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,640
Okay, sure.

569
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
Let's take a chance.

570
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,010
We'll either hit or miss.

571
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,910
- Of course. You have luck. - Let's go.

572
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,180
Next up are Kwang Soo and Da Hee.

573
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,350
This is what I think.

574
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,420
I feel like those two will win today's challenge.

575
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,930
Still, they'll end up on one of the grueling trips.

576
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,200
They'll also win in a dirty manner.

577
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,860
Let's see.

578
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,700
I felt the weight of Jae Seok and Somin's briefcase...

579
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
when I lifted his arm.

580
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,540
You felt the weight?

581
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,840
I did.

582
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,210
I felt the weight of their briefcase,

583
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,110
and it was heavier than this.

584
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,310
- Really? - Yes.

585
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,380
Hold on a second.

586
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,810
I'm sure of it. I have a knack for these things.

587
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,820
Take 10. What's there to think about?

588
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,020
I said theirs was lighter.

589
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,060
We can only win every battle if we know our opponents.

590
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,220
Get it?

591
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,460
What does that have to do with this?

592
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,130
Jae Seok and Somin...

593
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,800
took at least five.

594
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,700
- Let's take 10 then. - 10?

595
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,040
What if having too much gives us a disadvantage?

596
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,840
Should we take 10?

597
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
I'd take them all if I could.

598
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,240
We can only take 10 though.

599
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,940
Haha, how many did you take? Five?

600
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,280
I bet he played safe.

601
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,680
Since his partner's Ji Hyo, he probably took six.

602
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,380
- Seven. - I'm sure of it.

603
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,050
- Lucky 7. - 6 or 7.

604
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,350
(She wanted to take seven earlier.)

605
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,760
No one would take seven. That's too obvious.

606
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,290
Of course not.

607
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,530
I think that means Jin Young took seven.

608
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,430
No, I was just saying.

609
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,130
When you said it,

610
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,000
Jong Kook's face twitched a little.

611
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,370
Only old people care about seven being a lucky number.

612
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,540
You're old.

613
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,910
Yes, Turbo.

614
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,140
(Haha and Se Chan's joint attack.)

615
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,510
He must think of you as his friend to say that.

616
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,880
Why would you tell on me?

617
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,210
- What? - I was just saying.

618
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,150
- Are you really friends? - We are.

619
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,980
We're friends.

620
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,620
We went on a trip as one.

621
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,720
No way.

622
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,020
He adores Se Chan.

623
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,290
- Are you jealous? - Yes.

624
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,620
What's your secret?

625
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,290
(How do you get him to adore you?)

626
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,530
- What? - By Jong Kook.

627
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,600
Just grovel.

628
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,870
(It's simple.)

629
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,100
Just grovel.

630
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,230
Don't try anything.

631
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,900
Don't try anything, and grovel.

632
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,270
(Groveling)

633
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,340
- Good boy. - That's how you do it.

634
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,480
(So that's what he's been doing.)

635
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,810
You're out early.

636
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,510
You easily came to a conclusion.

637
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,910
- That was fast. - Right.

638
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,050
- You took 10, didn't you? - No.

639
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,450
Se Chan and Hanna, you're up.

640
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,450
Look how flushed they are.

641
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,490
- They took a gamble. - You don't look great.

642
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,460
You went big or small. It's either 1 or 10.

643
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,530
- You're wrong. - It's obvious they took 10.

644
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:24,160
We weren't sure, so we didn't take the risk.

645
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,930
Da Hee is quite hot-blooded too.

646
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,670
(How did he know?)

647
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,700
They took 10.

648
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,340
5. Let's take 5.

649
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,710
- Let's take 5. - Sure.

650
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,240
(Did you hear that?)

651
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,940
Hanna!

652
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,410
Let's take three instead.

653
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,410
(How many did each team take?)

654
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,450
Okay, good.

655
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,620
Let's power through.

656
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,050
(All 6 teams have chosen their diamonds.)

657
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,920
We chose a number you'll never guess.

658
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,990
You've all chosen your diamonds.

659
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,160
So here are the rules of today's race.

660
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,490
You will steal your opponents' diamonds in today's...

661
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,000
Romance Goes Away.

662
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:03,440
The teams with the most and the least diamonds...

663
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
and the teams with the same amount of diamonds...

664
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,770
will be on the Shuddering Package.

665
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,180
(Teams with the most, the least,)

666
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,080
(and the same number of diamonds are out.)

667
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,780
(They'll all be on the Shuddering Package.)

668
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,820
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee has 10.)

669
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,020
It's best to have about half.

670
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,420
(Kwang Soo, the best liar ever)

671
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,220
- Nice. - We can't have the same amount.

672
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,390
Right, that too.

673
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,860
It's best to have about half.

674
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,060
- Right. - The remaining couples...

675
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,560
will win the Luxury Package.

676
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,530
(The remaining teams will win the Luxury Package.)

677
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,400
You all seem defeated.

678
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,600
We can't have too many or too less.

679
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,140
What are we supposed to do?

680
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,840
- What do we do? - We need to steal each other's.

681
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,280
Just stay back!

682
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,410
If you have too less, you have to steal more.

683
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,010
If you win a game,

684
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,920
you'll get the chance to view a team's diamonds...

685
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,650
and receive an opportunity...

686
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,220
to either steal some or give some of yours.

687
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,090
When you win, you must choose from either option.

688
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,590
You can't maintain your amount.

689
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,260
Let me reveal the number of diamonds.

690
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,170
Out of all teams,

691
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,670
the one with the most...

692
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,940
- has 10. - Of course.

693
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,610
Gosh, did someone really take 10?

694
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,310
The team with the least number of diamonds...

695
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,780
- 1? - is 1.

696
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,410
That's obvious too.

697
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,680
The number of teams that have the same number of diamonds...

698
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,920
is three total.

699
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,690
(3 teams have the same amount?)

700
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,860
I bet they all have five.

701
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,560
The same amount?

702
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,290
Three teams have the same amount.

703
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:37,360
I think that 3 teams have the same amount of 10.

704
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,730
I agree.

705
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,470
I see people like to gamble.

706
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,940
Let's head out to play the first game then.

707
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,370
- Sure. - Let's go!

708
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,940
(The diamond war begins!)

709
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,340
Out of all the couples here, I think only one...

710
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,280
- looks compatible. - Which one?

711
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:59,120
(One couple looks compatible?)

712
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,420
Seok Jin and Sang Yeob.

713
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,290
Seok Jin and Sang Yeob.

714
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,090
Did you know that we both turned around?

715
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,300
- I know. - We thought it'd be us.

716
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,530
We were hoping.

717
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,800
You'll witness our team winning today.

718
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,340
This is in the way.

719
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
It won't be long enough.

720
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,140
Of course, it is.

721
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,710
What are you two talking about?

722
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,910
- What? - She was fidgeting with this.

723
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:29,780
You'll develop feelings for each other at this rate.

724
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,320
Kwang Soo's ears are getting red.

725
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,650
(Did feelings develop after just two meetings?)

726
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,620
I know you want a satisfying visual,

727
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,390
but you look ugly after losing weight.

728
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,130
(The leading man is too ugly.)

729
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,960
- Gosh. - For a romantic scene...

730
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,460
- Unbelievable. - Your hair...

731
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,600
is too short to play a love interest.

732
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,530
What does that have to do with anything?

733
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,200
- Why does that matter? - You just...

734
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,870
don't look your best.

735
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,740
Do you know the Ernest films?

736
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,640
Are you kidding me?

737
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,880
"Ernest Goes to Jail".

738
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,510
"Ernest Goes to School".

739
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,520
"Ernest Goes to Camp".

740
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,420
Try putting on your cap backwards.

741
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,950
To the side.

742
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:10,290
Put it to the side.

743
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,830
To the side? Do you take me for a fool?

744
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,490
Who wears a cap like that?

745
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,260
Ask Da Hee what she thinks.

746
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,230
What do you think?

747
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,530
I think shooting the TV series wore him out.

748
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,840
He does seem uglier than before.

749
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,410
She's the kind of person that...

750
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,110
smiles and says whatever's on her mind.

751
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,210
Even my stylist said that...

752
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,950
you were very handsome then.

753
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,920
But I feel a different vibe today.

754
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,920
He looks like a living corpse.

755
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,760
(A living corpse dressed in white)

756
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,220
How could you call me that?

757
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,860
A living corpse!

758
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,300
Gosh.

759
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,030
He's not even a squid anymore.

760
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,800
(He'll be a ghost if he loses weight again.)

761
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,700
Here's the first game that'll redistribute the diamonds.

762
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,800
- All right. - Let's go.

763
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,340
The first game is Say in Three Syllables.

764
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,510
I'll say one syllable, and each couple will individually...

765
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,780
say 1 more each to make up a 3-syllable word.

766
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,910
The 3-syllable word?

767
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,220
You'll immediately be out if you fail to make a word.

768
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,950
For example, if I say, "Blue",

769
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,320
"Blue jeans".

770
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,130
You succeeded by making up a word.

771
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,990
- What about "Green grapes"? - That's good.

772
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,060
Somin, do you get that?

773
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,500
(Let's do a practice round.)

774
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,630
"Blue".

775
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,970
- "Green". - "Grapes".

776
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,300
That's the word I came up with.

777
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,840
(Da Hee's being competitive.)

778
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,870
Da Hee.

779
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,570
What's wrong with you?

780
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,840
Da Hee, I'm sorry!

781
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,880
(Has the battle already begun?)

782
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,850
- What was that? - Is the game on?

783
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,980
- Come on. - What was that?

784
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,920
- Unbelievable. - Why are you so on edge?

785
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,580
You're right about that.

786
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,850
She surprised me.

787
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,650
(Round 1 begins amidst the competitiveness.)

788
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,720
We'll play in the order you all decide upon.

789
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,630
- Da Hee should go first. - Why?

790
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,930
We'll go counter-clockwise.

791
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,460
- Are we up first? - Here we go.

792
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,760
Ready,

793
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,370
set, go!

794
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,670
"Ear".

795
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:02,170
- "Wax". - "Dig".

796
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,970
(Ear wax dig?)

797
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,540
What's that?

798
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,840
(Does it mean "remove ear wax"?)

799
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,410
It should form a proper word.

800
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,080
- Well... - What was that?

801
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,250
What on earth did you do?

802
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,420
Why would you say "wax"?

803
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,190
There's "earrings".

804
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,690
Yes, you're right.

805
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,490
- That was a practice round. - Kwang Soo...

806
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,160
It's a new game, so cut us some slack.

807
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,260
Okay.

808
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,990
Since you had to go first, I'll give you another chance later.

809
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,730
We're given another chance.

810
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,400
Do you all understand the rules now?

811
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,530
- What? - We get it now.

812
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,270
We'll start with Haha.

813
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,570
- Okay. - Keep the order.

814
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,840
- Ready, - Let's do this.

815
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,170
set, go. "Foot".

816
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,540
- "Sole". - "Of one's foot".

817
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,210
- "Blue". - "Colored".

818
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,380
"Bird".

819
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,910
- "Oc". - "To".

820
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,250
"Pus".

821
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,450
"F".

822
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,120
"Fashion".

823
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,390
(He spits out a random word.)

824
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,760
(Jae Seok scores big once again.)

825
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,560
- What was that? - What is he?

826
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,260
- Let's do it again. - "Lung capacity".

827
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,860
- "Fashion". - Come on.

828
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,260
- What was that? - Let's play it again.

829
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,460
Play it again.

830
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,570
What's wrong with him?

831
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,270
- "Fashion". - I thought he was talking in sleep.

832
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,940
Play it again. Look forward.

833
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,810
Look forward. Play it again.

834
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,070
Come on, Fashion King.

835
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,510
Okay.

836
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,410
Let's start from Da Hee and Kwang Soo again. Get ready.

837
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,910
- Do we always start? - You can do it.

838
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,950
Shall we change the order?

839
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,350
- Yes. - They already started.

840
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,420
- Shall we go in this order? - Let's start with Hanna.

841
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,350
- Okay. - The one whom I point starts.

842
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,350
- Okay. - Okay.

843
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,260
Get ready, set, go.

844
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,260
"Window".

845
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,890
(The first word is window.)

846
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,930
"Stew".

847
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,730
- "Bean stew". - "Window bean stew".

848
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,270
(The word doesn't make sense.)

849
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,570
(They think of something savory.)

850
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,270
- They lost. - "Mulberry bark paper".

851
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,010
- "Mulberry bark paper". - Why did you say that?

852
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,470
- It's over. You lost. - Why did you say that?

853
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,380
- They lost. - I thought of Changdeokgung Palace.

854
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,410
- Changdeokgung Palace? - Yes.

855
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,350
- It's over. - There are many answers.

856
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,610
It's not easy.

857
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,450
(Se Chan and Hanna are eliminated.)

858
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,290
Let's start with Da Hee next.

859
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,020
Get ready, set, go. "Tang."

860
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,460
- "Dy". - "Nasty".

861
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,190
- "Roe". - "Roe stew".

862
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,560
"Jawbreaker" could have worked.

863
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,960
(Jawbreaker!)

864
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,770
Goodness, Jong Kook.

865
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,900
(Jin Young can throw punches as hard as jawbreakers.)

866
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,000
"Jawbreaker".

867
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,570
- What were you thinking? - He's selfish.

868
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,610
We have three teams left.

869
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,380
- Seok Jin will start. - Okay.

870
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,610
Get ready, set, go. "Gui".

871
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,950
- "Llo". - "Tine".

872
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,610
"Ho".

873
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,850
(The first Korean word is "ho".)

874
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,050
- "Ri". - Time's up.

875
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,650
- Time is up. - First of all,

876
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,360
- Ji Hyo's turn was already over. - Was it over?

877
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,690
(Ji Hyo was so out of it.)

878
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:42,530
The game is over when it's Ji Hyo's turn.

879
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,460
Da Hee and Kwang Soo still have a chance.

880
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,200
- It's the final round. - Final round.

881
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Let's go.

882
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,530
- With Kwang Soo's team? - Yes.

883
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:50,370
- We'll definitely win. - Of course.

884
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,440
- We'll definitely win. - Which team will start?

885
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,670
- This team will start. - Get ready.

886
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,540
- It's over if they lose. - Start. "Pine".

887
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,610
- "Tree". - "Pine tree".

888
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,650
(The word is pine tree.)

889
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:00,950
They did well.

890
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,950
"Bul".

891
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,350
(The given word is bul.)

892
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,350
"Guk".

893
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,190
(Sang Yeob, it's Bulguksa Temple.)

894
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:10,060
(Bulguk...)

895
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,360
"Bap".

896
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,860
(What is "bulgukbap"?)

897
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,660
What did he say?

898
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,060
- "Bul". - "Guk".

899
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,630
(They make up a new dish.)

900
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,270
Bulgukbap doesn't exist.

901
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,700
- There's Bulguksa Temple. - That's right.

902
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,070
- Come on. - He misheard it.

903
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,010
- That's good. - Okay.

904
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,740
- We won. - It was Bulguksa Temple.

905
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,240
We're looking at the big picture.

906
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,880
The winning team is Da Hee and Kwang Soo.

907
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,420
(A Korean restaurant in Changwon)

908
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,250
As the result of the first mission Say in Three Syllables,

909
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,620
Da Hee and Kwang Soo won a chance to distribute their diamonds.

910
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,130
Please come forward,

911
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,430
and find out if you're safe or in danger.

912
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,000
It's a big advantage.

913
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,370
Kwang Soo will definitely be dangerous.

914
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,000
- Is it necessary to find out? - We can't know.

915
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,870
I tell you whether you're safe. If you're in danger, I explain why.

916
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,040
- Listen closely. - What is it?

917
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,610
Da Hee is so determined even in her pose.

918
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,350
- They're so ambitious. - They are.

919
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,850
- Da Hee is obviously ambitious. - They're so ambitious.

920
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,720
- They could be conscious of it. - Excuse me.

921
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,490
Can you keep quiet? I can't hear well.

922
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,530
She makes so much fuss.

923
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,430
- She makes so much fuss. - I know.

924
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,900
- I'm sorry. - She's so fussy.

925
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,770
I'm not making a fuss. I'm asking you.

926
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,270
- Seriously. - She's asking you to shut it.

927
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,070
Please.

928
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,470
Hey, you jerk.

929
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,270
Here's your current status.

930
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,570
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee have 10.)

931
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,650
You have the highest amount. You even have the same amount.

932
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,880
- Really? - You're in danger.

933
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,050
(They have the same amount.)

934
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:52,190
(Three teams have the same amount.)

935
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:56,800
(That means 2 other teams have 10 diamonds.)

936
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:04,170
(Which are the other 2 teams that chose 10?)

937
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,970
Choose one team.

938
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:09,340
Open their briefcase, and count the number of their diamonds.

939
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,450
Then decide if you'll give more or take their diamonds.

940
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,350
Decide which team you'll choose.

941
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,290
I saw what Jae Seok did.

942
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,260
His team doesn't have 10 each.

943
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,690
We should give some to them.

944
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,060
- Can I take it? - Aren't you being secretive?

945
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,860
The winning team decided to give their diamonds...

946
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,270
to Jae Seok and Somin.

947
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:37,470
(They decide to give their diamonds to Jae Seok and Somin.)

948
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,640
Take their briefcase. Come to the front, and open it.

949
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,770
They can check inside the briefcase.

950
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,340
- Why us? - Others will see it too.

951
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,040
- Right. - They'll hide it.

952
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,750
Come on, we have 10 inside.

953
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,420
- They have 5. - They have 5.

954
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,150
(Laughing)

955
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,360
(Is it what you expected?)

956
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,360
They must have only one. I have...

957
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,730
- Did I make a mistake? - Kwang Soo.

958
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,960
Come here for a minute.

959
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,800
Look, Kwang Soo.

960
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,930
They took the ones of the same color as ours.

961
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:11,470
(They were in the diamond room at Jinhae Station.)

962
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,710
(Let's go with 10.)

963
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,480
(Just like Somin, Jae Seok acts based on his feelings.)

964
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:25,080
(1 of the 2 teams that have 10 was Jae Seok and Somin.)

965
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,320
Did Somin match the color to the color of your outfit?

966
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,620
- Yes. - Did you pick blue ones?

967
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,020
Yes, Somin matched the colors.

968
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,890
We'll give them five.

969
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,060
- Are they taking them out here? - If they do...

970
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,100
Shall we give them four?

971
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,830
- It means that they don't have 10. - 4?

972
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,700
Another team may have five.

973
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,700
- It could coincide. - Five might be possible.

974
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,470
We'll make it ambiguous and give them three.

975
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,910
- They're taking a long time. - I got it.

976
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,050
What do you think?

977
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,920
They could take any amount from 1 to 10.

978
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,880
- They have to take at least one? - Yes.

979
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,650
We can't know how it will turn out.

980
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,320
- It doesn't make a difference. - Won't you show us?

981
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,990
- No. - If you took one...

982
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,960
I'll announce the current status.

983
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,960
- The highest number as of now... - 10?

984
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
is 13.

985
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,200
(The highest number is 13.)

986
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,470
(7 versus 13)

987
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,830
- It could also increase. - The lowest is...

988
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
one.

989
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,200
(The lowest number is still 1.)

990
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,470
Two teams have the same number of diamonds.

991
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,580
(Two teams have the same number of diamonds.)

992
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,240
Was it four teams before?

993
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,950
- 3 teams had the same. - 3 teams.

994
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,510
- Now it's 2 teams. - 2 teams have the same amount?

995
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,520
- That's right. - What happened?

996
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
What's wrong?

997
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,690
- Why? - Come on.

998
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,520
Listen to them.

999
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,060
It was three teams before.

1000
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,830
- No. - One team...

1001
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
Two teams...

1002
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,360
You're such an actor.

1003
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,270
That means the ones that we changed...

1004
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,400
They also had 10 diamonds. They gave out 3.

1005
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,870
- We could lose if we stay still. - Now,

1006
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:55,270
let's go to the next location for your second mission.

1007
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,580
(They go inside the restaurant for the next mission.)

1008
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,850
There are 3 teams that have 10.

1009
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,320
- There were three including us. - Right.

1010
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,450
Now we have 7, and Jae Seok's team has 13.

1011
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,990
- No team should have the same, - Right.

1012
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,490
but two teams have the same number.

1013
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,660
They can't have 13,

1014
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,700
so seven can be the only coinciding number.

1015
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,960
Another team also has seven.

1016
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,930
- Isn't it a one-time payment? - Really?

1017
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,270
Isn't it...

1018
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,740
- What? - You're right.

1019
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,300
Come on, please concentrate.

1020
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,270
- Da Hee. - I'm not good with numbers.

1021
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:30,010
- That's why... - You seem bad in general.

1022
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,040
I don't understand games easily.

1023
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,310
- No. - Two teams have the same.

1024
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,320
That's wrong, Kwang Soo. Stop confusing me.

1025
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,180
You don't understand. Why do you keep getting angry?

1026
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,050
Aren't there five teams in total?

1027
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,490
Our team, Team Blue, Team Red, Team White,

1028
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,530
and Team Red and White. There are five teams.

1029
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,800
- Two of them... - You talk as if you understand.

1030
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,430
- Wait, think about it. - Seriously.

1031
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,200
1 and 2.

1032
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,100
(Somin approaches secretly.)

1033
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,770
1 team had 1, and another had 10.

1034
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,940
- Right? - 3 teams had 10.

1035
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,210
We didn't know the exact number.

1036
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,980
We didn't know there were 3 teams that had 10.

1037
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,750
You startled me.

1038
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,150
Get away from us. Do you want to get yelled at?

1039
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,850
You really startled me.

1040
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Somin.

1041
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,390
She understands the situation anyway.

1042
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,960
She doesn't understand anyway.

1043
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,190
I think everyone except you understood.

1044
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,360
Goodness.

1045
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,330
Da Hee, wake up.

1046
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,270
If you don't understand, don't get angry or raise your voice.

1047
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,870
Gosh. Come on, Kwang Soo.

1048
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,070
3 teams had 10 diamonds.

1049
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,370
We aren't sure if there are 3 teams with 10 diamonds.

1050
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,380
They told us.

1051
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,740
- Did you? - I'll hit you.

1052
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:43,120
3 teams had 10. The numbers coincide.

1053
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,080
How many do you have?

1054
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,150
Get away. What do you mean?

1055
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,350
- Seven? - How many of what?

1056
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,620
- Do you have seven? - No.

1057
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,790
We don't have seven.

1058
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,360
Why are there two teams with the same number?

1059
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,900
- We don't understand it either. - It's strange.

1060
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,570
(Both of them are the same.)

1061
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,670
- It's strange. - We shouldn't talk about that.

1062
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:02,670
Don't talk about that.

1063
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,170
- Ji Hyo. - Don't talk to her.

1064
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,940
Don't talk unnecessarily. Don't tell her that.

1065
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,180
Don't tell her why there are two teams.

1066
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,780
Two teams of what?

1067
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,510
Goodness.

1068
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,920
Stay quiet. Just focus on the game.

1069
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,750
Sit with your partner behind you.

1070
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:22,960
Come on.

1071
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,360
Come on, come on.

1072
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,460
- Come on. - One sits in front of the other.

1073
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,960
Sit front and back with your partner.

1074
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,530
Front and back?

1075
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,230
- I don't know what's going on. - Let's sit first.

1076
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:35,770
- All right. - Are we playing for food?

1077
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,810
You can win Diamond Distribution Card and meal tickets.

1078
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,510
Let's play a relay game called Express with Drawing.

1079
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,410
I'm bad at drawing. I'm in trouble.

1080
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,550
- Me neither. - Can you draw well?

1081
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,650
No, I can't.

1082
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,550
Hanna, I'm sorry. I can't draw well at all.

1083
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,320
I can draw. Okay.

1084
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,260
Look at the word that the staff gives you.

1085
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,730
Six members will draw in a relay and complete a drawing as a group.

1086
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,860
Four cards among the distributed cards will have keywords on them.

1087
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,870
The other two cards will say "Mafia".

1088
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,070
(The remaining 2 cards will have "Mafia" written on them.)

1089
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,100
Mafia.

1090
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,440
The members with the keyword will be civilians...

1091
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,370
and figure out the mafias who won't know what the keyword is.

1092
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,380
The mafias must figure out the keyword before the civilians...

1093
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,910
discover their identity.

1094
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,910
(Mafias must figure out the keyword.)

1095
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,950
We must fish them out.

1096
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,650
The civilians will get a point if they name both mafias.

1097
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,350
If three or more teams name both mafias correctly,

1098
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,550
they will win an additional point.

1099
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,360
The mafias will get a point if they can figure out the keyword.

1100
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,590
And if no one names them as mafias, they will get an additional point.

1101
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,290
This is hard. Mafias will have a hard job.

1102
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,900
Then the civilians can't draw in detail, right?

1103
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,760
- It'd be easier for the mafias. - Think however you like.

1104
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,470
- But if you're bad at drawing, - That's right.

1105
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,100
- we might think you're a mafia. - You'll be suspected as a mafia.

1106
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,970
4 members will know what it is, and 2 members won't know.

1107
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,100
That's right.

1108
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,670
We will tell you what the keyword is to those in the back.

1109
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,580
However, your partners won't know what it is.

1110
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,410
(The key lies in the subtlety.)

1111
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,520
(Jong Kook, Somin, Haha, Hanna, Da Hee, and Sang Yeob will play.)

1112
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,520
- Let's start. - Let's get this started.

1113
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,720
- What if he wins first place? - Jae Seok's was nice.

1114
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,560
Getting the mafia card in the first round is nice.

1115
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,160
(6 cards are randomly distributed among the members.)

1116
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,690
(Two of them, who don't know the keyword, are the mafias.)

1117
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,330
You cannot discuss it among yourselves.

1118
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,230
That's right.

1119
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,400
- When will... - This is fun.

1120
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,030
- The fun has tripled now. - My gosh. I don't get it at all.

1121
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,240
Don't show it to us when you read it.

1122
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,340
- Make sure we can't see it. - Don't show it to us.

1123
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,410
When you put your heads down, we'll reveal the keyword.

1124
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,480
- Put your heads down. - What could it be?

1125
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,080
The object is this.

1126
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,150
(The keyword is the microphone.)

1127
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,350
This is... My gosh.

1128
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,810
- My goodness. This one is... - It will be so obvious.

1129
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,080
It will be easy to spot.

1130
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,880
But we never know how this will pan out.

1131
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,550
- Let's start. - Go ahead.

1132
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,590
(Jong Kook starts.)

1133
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,520
Jong Kook will start acting now.

1134
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,820
- Is he a mafia? - It looks like...

1135
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,290
(Thinking)

1136
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,430
(He's still thinking?)

1137
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,200
Seeing how Jong Kook is thinking about this for long,

1138
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,100
- He must be the mafia. - Jong Kook seems...

1139
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,470
It seems like he's struggling.

1140
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,640
Jong Kook, do you want to take a break?

1141
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,900
Is that a facial expression?

1142
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,010
(Is he the mafia?)

1143
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,110
Okay.

1144
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,840
- This game keeps us on our toes. - If you are a civilian,

1145
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,780
- you must show us that you're one. - We will know anyway.

1146
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,680
When you're drawing it, you should be reasonable.

1147
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,850
(After thinking hard about it, he draws a circle.)

1148
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,690
- I see. That. - Now, I get it.

1149
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,790
You get it, right?

1150
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,760
(Did he draw that for a reason?)

1151
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,000
- He wants them to continue with it. - It's so round.

1152
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,060
- It's not continuous. - She can continue with it...

1153
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,400
- if she knows what it is. - Didn't I do a good job?

1154
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,900
When Jae Seok was drawing it,

1155
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,370
- his picture wasn't all connected. - That's right.

1156
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,370
- But this is... - Someone can continue with that,

1157
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,710
- but that person has to know. - She didn't draw it.

1158
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,110
Someone can connect it later.

1159
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,810
No, that was a good addition.

1160
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,910
- That was good. - Somin is imaginative.

1161
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,250
Somin, my gosh.

1162
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,120
Somin, I think you did well.

1163
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,580
I don't know what she is, but she did well.

1164
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,120
(Haha starts drawing without a hint of hesitation.)

1165
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,660
- Hey, what's up with you today? - Is that a man with glasses?

1166
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,200
(A man wearing glasses...)

1167
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,300
- Why didn't you say it out loud? - That's Jae Seok.

1168
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,570
- That's Jae Seok's mouth. - My gosh.

1169
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,900
- That's Jae Seok's mouth. - That's Jae Seok.

1170
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,840
Wait a second. He's drawing it while looking at Jae Seok.

1171
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,040
- I get what he's trying to draw. - I see.

1172
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,340
(Did Haha draw Jae Seok, the host?)

1173
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,440
Okay, I got it.

1174
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,150
- Haha. - That was smart.

1175
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,280
(Yu Jae Seok)

1176
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,350
Okay.

1177
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,280
Great.

1178
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:16,090
It's Hanna's turn. Look, everyone. She's really smart...

1179
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,820
from my experience.

1180
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,230
- She's drawing stars. - I see.

1181
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,700
(Hold on. She's drawing stars?)

1182
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,500
- It makes sense. - Yes, it does.

1183
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,800
- It's logical. - I see it. That's right.

1184
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,100
- Hanna is good. - The stars fit.

1185
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,270
That's my wife.

1186
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,980
(Hanna drew stars all over the drawing.)

1187
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:38,880
It's Da Hee's turn.

1188
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
(No one seems suspicious so far.)

1189
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,410
She had been fooled once.

1190
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,050
- What's wrong? - What should I do?

1191
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,590
What was that? Was that part of her act?

1192
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,930
If that was, she's one good actress. What is that?

1193
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,990
(What did Da Hee draw?)

1194
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,030
- What is that? - My gosh. "Laughing out loud"?

1195
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,600
(Laughing out loud?)

1196
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,970
- "Laughing out loud"? - I think she's a genius.

1197
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,640
This makes sense.

1198
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,170
- This fits with the keyword. - That makes sense.

1199
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,140
(If she's a civilian, she must draw things to prove she's one.)

1200
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,440
- That can fit. - That's right.

1201
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,440
- This could work. - Exactly.

1202
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,450
(It seems as if she knows the answer.)

1203
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,010
I get it. This makes sense.

1204
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,610
- This is understandable. - It works.

1205
00:44:17,150 --> 00:44:18,320
I don't get this one.

1206
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,750
- It took a weird turn. - I can't see it.

1207
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,020
If you're a civilian, you must show that you are a civilian.

1208
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,730
(Sang Yeob draws an image of a microphone.)

1209
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,500
We completed a drawing together.

1210
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,470
(Which members are the mafias?)

1211
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,870
The civilians can write down the names of the mafias.

1212
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,870
(Mafias have to write down the keyword.)

1213
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:37,900
My gosh, seriously.

1214
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:39,610
What should I do?

1215
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,040
The mafia game is so fun.

1216
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,410
- This is so much fun. - It's fun.

1217
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,710
It's a fun game to watch too.

1218
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:46,110
- It's fun to watch too. - Everyone can...

1219
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:47,780
This week's episode is fun to watch.

1220
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,080
- Make sure you watch it. - Stay tuned!

1221
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,250
(Stay tuned)

1222
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,720
It's so funny!

1223
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:55,620
(Falling)

1224
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,620
Somin, you and Haha can't get along.

1225
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,560
(Was that obvious?)

1226
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,190
- She was uncomfortable, right? - Yes, she was.

1227
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,330
That was uncomfortable, wasn't it?

1228
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,200
All right. The keyword was...

1229
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,430
You won't be able to figure it out.

1230
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,270
- It was a microphone. - That's right. A microphone.

1231
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,400
The mafias...

1232
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,340
(Then who are the mafias?)

1233
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:16,840
(It seems as if everyone knew the keyword.)

1234
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,280
(It seemed difficult because no one stood out as a mafia.)

1235
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,750
(Who are the mafias?)

1236
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,720
They were Somin and Da Hee.

1237
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,120
- You weren't the mafia? - My gosh.

1238
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,150
You weren't the mafia?

1239
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,260
(Somin and Da Hee were the mafias.)

1240
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,290
You weren't the mafia?

1241
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,030
- Hanna wasn't the mafia. - It was Da Hee?

1242
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,100
Hanna.

1243
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,200
- I wrote Somin's name, - Hanna.

1244
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,300
- but changed it last minute. - Hanna, you were so good.

1245
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,470
- My gosh. - You were acting.

1246
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,740
- Didn't Da Hee wrote that to rhyme? - Did you get it right?

1247
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,670
- I thought it was for rhyming. - People think differently.

1248
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,970
- I thought you were a mafia. - This is incredible.

1249
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,080
- I thought that was a sign. - My goodness.

1250
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,380
How did you manage that, Hanna?

1251
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,680
- Did you know the keyword? - No, I had no idea.

1252
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,250
- I thought you did it to rhyme. - I didn't know.

1253
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,650
- It's the top of the microphone. - That's right.

1254
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,220
(Jong Kook drew the top part of the microphone.)

1255
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,590
- Somin drew the sun. - I just drew the sun.

1256
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,060
- It was good to that point. - It was good.

1257
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,490
- It looked like a microphone. - It looked like the sound waves.

1258
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,830
- The sound waves. - That's right.

1259
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,060
- The sound was coming from it. - This was...

1260
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,130
- He's the host. - Jae Seok holds the microphone.

1261
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,130
- He's the host. - Haha did well.

1262
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,530
- Haha did great. - On this drawing,

1263
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,740
Somin drew the squiggly lines.

1264
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,510
I thought it was my chance to confuse the others.

1265
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,310
Singers are like stars, and they hold microphones.

1266
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,440
You were trying to mislead them?

1267
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,540
- Yes. - You went a step further.

1268
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:26,180
- I wanted to look like a mafia. - I did suspect her.

1269
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,150
That's why a lot of people named you as a mafia.

1270
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,350
- My gosh. - Hanna.

1271
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:30,750
You did well. We'll get more points.

1272
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,390
(She stopped the mafias and other civilians from getting points.)

1273
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,650
The sun confused me.

1274
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,590
- I didn't know what it was. - She got lucky then.

1275
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,830
I thought about what to draw, so I ended up writing this instead.

1276
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:40,830
- I had nothing to draw. - I thought that...

1277
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,230
- she was a civilian. - I thought that it was a good sign.

1278
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,300
- I thought she knew the answer. - She really got lucky.

1279
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,100
- Microphone. - I drew an obvious one.

1280
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,330
I just drew a microphone.

1281
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,440
- It's the microphone stand. - I didn't know it was a microphone.

1282
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,070
No one has guessed the mafias except Hanna.

1283
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,170
Hanna won this mind game.

1284
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,110
- Hanna, you were so cool. - My goodness.

1285
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,180
Hanna figured out that the mafias were Somin and Da Hee.

1286
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,150
Only Hanna and Se Chan will get one point.

1287
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,250
- Okay. - Oh, no.

1288
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,680
(Only Se Chan and Hanna get 1 point.)

1289
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,720
She was amazing.

1290
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,150
- Hey, look at that. - This is confusing.

1291
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,260
(Intense 2nd and 3rd rounds ensued.)

1292
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:14,330
(After guessing the mafias, Haha and Ji Hyo lead with 4 points.)

1293
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,700
(Final Standings)

1294
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:23,200
(Haha and Ji Hyo acquire a Diamond Distribution Card.)

1295
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,240
All right.

1296
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,170
As of now, you two have...

1297
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,470
(Where do Haha and Ji Hyo stand in the race?)

1298
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,010
the least number of diamonds which means you are in danger.

1299
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,680
However, you don't overlap.

1300
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,280
(They only have 1 which puts them last.)

1301
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:40,220
(We must take diamonds from other teams to avoid being last.)

1302
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:44,660
(Haha and Ji Hyo choose Se Chan and Hanna's briefcase.)

1303
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,490
Se Chan. Hanna. Give us your briefcase.

1304
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,530
- Ours? - My gosh.

1305
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,660
Hanna.

1306
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,970
(They chose our briefcase?)

1307
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,370
As of now, the team with the most diamonds has 13.

1308
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:58,970
- It hasn't changed. - It's still the same.

1309
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:01,070
The team with the least diamonds has three.

1310
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,140
(The lowest number is 3.)

1311
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,780
Only two teams overlap.

1312
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,310
(2 teams overlap.)

1313
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,350
13 and 3.

1314
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:10,880
- It means you gave them 2. - That means Haha had 1.

1315
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,420
They took 2 from a team that had 5 diamonds.

1316
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,190
(How many diamonds did Haha and Ji Hyo take?)

1317
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:17,220
(It's time to eat after the game.)

1318
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,460
Let's dig in.

1319
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,890
My gosh, what's all this?

1320
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:20,890
(The excellent meal is extravagant.)

1321
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:22,900
There's so much food for the excellent meal.

1322
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,100
You have beef?

1323
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,430
(Haha, Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, and Somin get the excellent meal.)

1324
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,600
There's a huge gap.

1325
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,710
- This is great considering. - Hey, this looks great.

1326
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,470
Poor Jin Young and Jong Kook.

1327
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,480
(Soy sauce, dried laver, and rice)

1328
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,980
- Do you want to switch? - No.

1329
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,980
(Jong Kook and Jin Young get the poor meal.)

1330
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:40,680
Enjoy your modest meal.

1331
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,150
- Eat a lot of your poor meal. - Enjoy your food.

1332
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,150
- Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your food.

1333
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,380
Thank you for the food.

1334
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,390
(Munching)

1335
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,360
- Isn't it good? - It's good.

1336
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,390
(Meat never fails us.)

1337
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,530
(The more they eat, the healthier they feel.)

1338
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,900
They serve great mung bean sprouts.

1339
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,700
- The rice itself is really good. - Mung bean sprouts are the best.

1340
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,700
Hey, can we...

1341
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:01,500
get some sesame oil?

1342
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,470
Sesame oil.

1343
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:05,640
- Don't we deserve sesame oil? - That's a reasonable request.

1344
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,510
- I really want some meat. - It's so good.

1345
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,210
I want some pumpkin.

1346
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,410
- Does anyone want some meat? - Yes, me!

1347
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,950
- Me! - I'd like some.

1348
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:17,320
(Yes! These people would like to get some meat.)

1349
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,450
Me too.

1350
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,320
If anyone wants to eat this meat...

1351
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,160
If anyone wants to eat this meat,

1352
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:30,100
you can endure the toe-pinching.

1353
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,430
Then I'll give you a piece of this meat.

1354
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,430
You'll pinch each other's.

1355
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,000
- I'll do it. I can endure it. - Okay.

1356
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,170
Which area will we pinch?

1357
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,770
I will give a piece to anyone who doesn't scream or frown.

1358
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,940
I will do it. Are you game?

1359
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:45,980
(I'm game.)

1360
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,610
I wasn't going to do it, but I'll do it because it's you.

1361
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,120
I won't lose. I never lose at this kind of game.

1362
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,220
I won't skimp out on it. I'll give you the whole chunk.

1363
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,490
- The whole chunk? Okay. - Yes.

1364
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,760
- Sang Yeob, you can do it! - Okay, Seok Jin.

1365
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,460
- Seok Jin. - Bring the meat.

1366
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,060
Why am I doing this twice today?

1367
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:02,090
(He's doing the toe pinching twice today.)

1368
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:03,130
Where are you going to pinch me?

1369
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,300
Your arm.

1370
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,630
- I'll do the same. - Hold on.

1371
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,570
I'll record it for you.

1372
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,540
In slow mode?

1373
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,040
(They use a high-quality camera for an accurate judgment.)

1374
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,040
All right.

1375
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,710
I'm strong.

1376
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,580
- I won against Shinhwa before. - I'm looking forward to this.

1377
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,650
Kwang Soo is really strong.

1378
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,720
- I'll try. - If you scream first, you lose.

1379
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,280
- You can't frown either. - Okay.

1380
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,990
This is super-slow mode. Go.

1381
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,990
Ready.

1382
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:35,960
(A man's pride and a chunk of meat depend on these toes.)

1383
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,060
Set, go.

1384
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,930
(Start)

1385
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,100
(They start attacking fiercely.)

1386
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,940
(Their faces look peaceful.)

1387
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,840
Smile, Sang Yeob.

1388
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,570
- You can win. - His face is red.

1389
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,710
(They said they'd pinch the arms, but he goes for the neck.)

1390
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,880
- Sang Yeob. - Do I have to...

1391
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,580
Do I have to do this to eat?

1392
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,220
(This won't work.)

1393
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,850
(Fluttering)

1394
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,990
That one's good.

1395
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:04,790
What was that?

1396
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,360
That was super-slow mode.

1397
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,230
- Didn't we win? - Right?

1398
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,330
Slow.

1399
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:12,470
It's slow mode. It works.

1400
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,770
(According to the detailed review,)

1401
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:19,470
(Sang Yeob frowned first.)

1402
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,370
Who won?

1403
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,680
Sang Yeob wins.

1404
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,910
But I didn't make any sound.

1405
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,980
But Sang Yeob wins.

1406
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,510
(Sang Yeob wins regardless.)

1407
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,650
(I endured the pain without making any sound.)

1408
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,150
(How could this be?)

1409
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:35,520
Lee Sang Yeob.

1410
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:37,920
I didn't make any sound.

1411
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,160
That's not the important part.

1412
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,190
That's what the game was about. Why is it not important?

1413
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,530
Why did I lose?

1414
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,300
Because Sang Yeob is handsome.

1415
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,930
(Do you really want to know?)

1416
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,340
(The answer was already given.)

1417
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,240
(Sang Yeob gets a chunk of meat because he's handsome.)

1418
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,410
Can you take a picture for us?

1419
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,370
(It's photo time with Somin and the meat.)

1420
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,980
Why did I lose?

1421
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,940
Because Sang Yeob is handsome.

1422
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,550
(Kwang Soo lost because of Sang Yeob's handsome face.)

1423
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,180
I think my mom will cry if she watches this scene.

1424
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,190
Everybody, here's a chunk too.

1425
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,160
We'll play a game and see who can get the shortest spinach.

1426
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,360
How do you play it?

1427
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,490
Female and male?

1428
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,430
You'll start from both sides and try to make it the shortest.

1429
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,930
I'll do it.

1430
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:15,960
No.

1431
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,000
No.

1432
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,330
(We'll withdraw.)

1433
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:22,440
Hold on.

1434
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,670
- No. - She doesn't want to do it.

1435
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,140
She said "no".

1436
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,310
(I'm a vegetarian today.)

1437
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,610
There's grilled short rib,

1438
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,640
duck, and the pumpkin too.

1439
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,780
Pumpkin too.

1440
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,810
Deal. Let's go.

1441
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,150
(Let's do it.)

1442
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,350
- Let's go. - But...

1443
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,780
- Be quiet. - Ask me.

1444
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,290
Just do it. Go.

1445
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,420
- Why would you do that? - Let's go.

1446
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,560
- You have to do it. - Is that all you're going to eat?

1447
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,060
(This is driving me nuts.)

1448
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,630
Hurry.

1449
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,470
(He stands up eventually.)

1450
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,700
Jong Kook came forward.

1451
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:56,840
How is that possible? She made him do it.

1452
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,940
That's not it.

1453
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,540
They have so much ambition. How can we beat them?

1454
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,680
We can.

1455
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,840
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee are the ambitious giants.)

1456
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,310
- Who will go first? - The spinach is really good.

1457
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,350
Is it?

1458
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,820
- We will... - We have to pick one.

1459
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,380
Pick a spinach.

1460
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,820
(They pick their spinach.)

1461
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,590
(Which one is better?)

1462
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:15,960
- Do you want this one? - Which one's long?

1463
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,220
Do you want to use a bean sprout?

1464
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,620
It's not that strong.

1465
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,230
Let's go.

1466
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,100
- Hold on. - What?

1467
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,260
(Hold on.)

1468
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,730
- Kwang Soo. - What?

1469
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,040
Did you eat something?

1470
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,910
(Look at him.)

1471
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,710
What?

1472
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:38,280
Did you eat while I was picking a spinach?

1473
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,710
What are you?

1474
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,720
(You're so sneaky.)

1475
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:45,120
Swallow. We have to play the game.

1476
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
(How did she know?)

1477
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:52,220
(Da Hee was focused on picking a spinach.)

1478
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:56,600
(He left and had a spoonful of rice.)

1479
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,530
(He was planning to eat spinach after as a side-dish.)

1480
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,270
(He got caught.)

1481
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,710
Swallow. We have to play the game.

1482
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,680
She keeps on nagging.

1483
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,040
(He clenches his teeth.)

1484
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,510
She told me to play the toe pinching game earlier.

1485
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:14,750
Meanwhile, she finished the seaweed soup.

1486
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,220
(She told him to play the toe pinching game.)

1487
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,850
(How did he know?)

1488
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,060
(Earlier when Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob were playing a game)

1489
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,660
(Slurping)

1490
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,800
(I'm going to eat regardless of what happens to him.)

1491
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,030
You guys have so many problems.

1492
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,800
You have too many issues.

1493
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,200
(You can't stop their sneakiness.)

1494
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,040
Do you see this? There's grilled short rib,

1495
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,810
duck, and pumpkin.

1496
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:43,140
It's hard to cut the spinach.

1497
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,610
You can't finish it. You have to leave some.

1498
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:46,610
Of course.

1499
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:49,520
If there's some stem left, it counts.

1500
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,780
It counts.

1501
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,790
(The ambitious giants are ready.)

1502
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:56,890
Start.

1503
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,790
- Let's start. - Ready.

1504
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,430
Ready.

1505
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,500
Go.

1506
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,730
(The spinach game starts.)

1507
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:11,640
(Oh, my eyes.)

1508
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:14,740
(The duck is ours.)

1509
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,940
Their lips touched.

1510
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,340
(Sighing)

1511
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,310
Cut it.

1512
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,880
- They did it. - Please.

1513
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:23,480
There's some left.

1514
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,850
(There's only a trace left.)

1515
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:25,950
It's this.

1516
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,650
(It's the power of ambition.)

1517
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,420
Jin Young and Jong Kook are next.

1518
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,820
You have to be pretty close.

1519
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,630
That's my tip. You have to be close.

1520
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,490
(It's my turn.)

1521
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,260
We don't need a long one.

1522
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,900
Come here.

1523
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,130
(Bite this.)

1524
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,240
Do we have to do this for meat?

1525
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,600
Is your heart pounding?

1526
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,040
(It's just a game.)

1527
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,010
Goodness.

1528
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,540
Don't get your feelings involved.

1529
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:52,980
It's a game to get meat.

1530
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,010
Stay still.

1531
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,720
He listens to her.

1532
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,680
Stay still. I'll go to you.

1533
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:01,490
- I'm coming. - Hey.

1534
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,380
- I'm coming. - Hey.

1535
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,750
(The spinach game starts.)

1536
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,150
- Hey. - Gosh.

1537
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,650
(I have to see this.)

1538
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:31,750
They might win.

1539
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,520
This is no joke.

1540
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:37,330
(Cutting)

1541
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,730
Bite. Bite.

1542
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,070
Cut it.

1543
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,600
Don't move.

1544
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,100
(Cutting)

1545
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,440
- We don't know yet. - I think it's a tie.

1546
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:51,880
- This is close. - We don't know yet.

1547
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,040
- I think it's a tie. - This is Da Hee and Kwang Soo's.

1548
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,580
We have the stem.

1549
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,710
Why did you chew on the stem?

1550
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,450
(For goodness' sake)

1551
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,280
- The stem... - It should have been the leaf.

1552
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,690
Is it my fault that spinach has stems?

1553
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,320
No, don't cut it.

1554
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:06,990
(She uses her nails to cut it while she's talking.)

1555
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,690
- No, don't cut it. - Hey, Da Hee.

1556
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:09,930
You cheater.

1557
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,860
- Goodness. - She can't do this.

1558
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,660
She was cutting it.

1559
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,370
- She cut it? - She did.

1560
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,600
You look good with Kwang Soo.

1561
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,570
It's close. We didn't lose.

1562
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,070
It's kind of close.

1563
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,410
(What's the result?)

1564
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,080
(Jong Kook and Jin Young win.)

1565
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,140
Jong Kook wins.

1566
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,050
Let's go. Come.

1567
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:33,250
Jong Kook likes it.

1568
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,890
Jong Kook met a good woman. She's feeding you.

1569
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,890
- You met a woman who can feed you. - That's right.

1570
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:41,930
I want to play the game with Sang Yeob.

1571
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,300
(She tries to squeeze in.)

1572
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,830
What? Me?

1573
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:51,230
- Why would you do that? - Why would he do it with you?

1574
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,300
My gosh.

1575
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,110
- Open up. - "Open up."

1576
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,880
(Dashing)

1577
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,310
Goodness.

1578
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:02,810
(They have no meat, so they need to eat more rice.)

1579
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,510
They're fighting over this.

1580
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,020
Are you kidding me? Hey.

1581
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:10,220
(The two actors are fighting over plain rice.)

1582
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,190
The seaweed soup is mine.

1583
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,860
(We'll give you extra rice.)

1584
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,860
- Oh, dear. - How's this?

1585
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,630
If you can imitate a duck, I'll give you some duck meat.

1586
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,670
What? Imitate a duck?

1587
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,500
- Can you do a duck? - A duck?

1588
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:30,370
That's Donald Duck. Are you trying to do this?

1589
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:33,810
(Flapping)

1590
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,880
(It's the real duck.)

1591
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,950
My goodness.

1592
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,210
She's an expert at imitating.

1593
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,920
What's this, Somin?

1594
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,620
(Everyone has a hard time mimicking the sound of a duck.)

1595
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,260
- What's that? - Donald Duck.

1596
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,230
- What's that? - A duck.

1597
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,330
(What are you doing, Hanna?)

1598
00:58:56,830 --> 00:58:58,130
What are you doing, Hanna?

1599
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,800
(Hanna is shameless.)

1600
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,970
(Hanna, you can do anything you please.)

1601
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,140
That's the best. Who else can make the sound?

1602
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,840
Can anyone do it better than Hanna? Or else, I'll give it to her.

1603
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,580
No one can be better than her.

1604
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,010
Whoever does it, I'll give it to you.

1605
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:13,420
- I wouldn't pretend to be a duck. - Okay.

1606
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,750
- I'll walk with confidence. - Go ahead.

1607
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,820
(He quacks like Jang Hyuk.)

1608
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,330
(He makes a surprise attack as Jang Hyuk.)

1609
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:25,630
"Un Nyeon!"

1610
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,030
(Their talents come together as a fantastic show.)

1611
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,700
(This is great.)

1612
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,740
- That's funny. - Didn't he do a good job?

1613
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,770
Yes, that was hilarious.

1614
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,640
- Who else... - Wait!

1615
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,980
Go, Jong Kook.

1616
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,010
(She's very resolute.)

1617
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:45,520
(Do I have to make a duck sound?)

1618
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,880
Me?

1619
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,690
He'll do it.

1620
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,920
(She forces him to do it.)

1621
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,050
Our team will go.

1622
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,690
- Will Jong Kook do it? - Here he goes.

1623
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,830
(Jong Kook never volunteered to do a mission like this.)

1624
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,730
(He does it.)

1625
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,760
Look.

1626
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,870
(He writes a new history on Running Man.)

1627
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,440
Look at his leg muscles.

1628
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,040
(Jong Kook duck is strong.)

1629
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,580
(Give some duck meat to Jin Young.)

1630
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:16,080
Jong Kook does it.

1631
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,380
(Jong Kook has changed after meeting Jin Young.)

1632
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,320
He normally wouldn't do that.

1633
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,650
- Why do I find it so moving? - I agree.

1634
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,850
I almost cried.

1635
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:25,960
- Jin Young is... - She's a trainer.

1636
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:26,990
Seriously.

1637
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,930
- You're on the show for four weeks? - Yes.

1638
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,930
(You're on the show for 4 weeks?)

1639
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:35,060
(The next 4 weeks will be like 4 years.)

1640
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:37,730
Take care of him, Jin Young.

1641
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:39,840
Don't worry, I'll be responsible.

1642
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,670
(I don't know anymore.)

1643
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,880
Hanna and Jong Kook did well.

1644
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,610
Jong Kook is the best so far.

1645
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:48,910
- Why? - Wait.

1646
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:52,080
Da Hee disappeared.

1647
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,380
Where did she go?

1648
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,720
She said, "Do I have to feed you all the time," and went in.

1649
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,690
- That's amazing. - I'm jealous.

1650
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,420
There she is.

1651
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,890
- My goodness. - She overdid it.

1652
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,430
My goodness.

1653
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,600
Look at her.

1654
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,200
She overdid it.

1655
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,840
Goodness.

1656
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,840
(She has a bad feeling about this.)

1657
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,880
(He's speechless.)

1658
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,410
(Gosh, Da Hee.)

1659
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:23,780
Keep your head up, Kwang Soo.

1660
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:25,650
Look at her directly.

1661
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,720
Keep your head up. She's working so hard.

1662
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,520
Come back, Kwang Soo.

1663
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,020
(I have to go.)

1664
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,720
(Keep going without me.)

1665
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,700
(He wants to turn away from Da Hee's efforts.)

1666
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,800
Take care of your partner.

1667
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,870
(He feels embarrassed for the first time.)

1668
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,970
Come back, Kwang Soo.

1669
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,230
(He feels embarrassed for the first time.)

1670
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,200
(She was thorough in her preparation,)

1671
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,110
(but something seems pathetic about her.)

1672
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,310
Kwang Soo.

1673
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,410
- After two times... - She works so hard.

1674
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,050
(Jae Seok brings it for Da Hee.)

1675
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,050
Go back in.

1676
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,880
(Da Hee worked hard until the end.)

1677
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:05,520
(Jae Seok approaches her with the savory duck.)

1678
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,120
Jong Kook will eat the meat.

1679
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,160
(He says it clearly.)

1680
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:13,530
(Jae Seok makes a very objective judgment.)

1681
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:16,670
Da Hee, go in and return the jacket.

1682
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,900
I even squatted.

1683
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:23,010
Da Hee, go back in.

1684
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:24,840
- Goodness. - Da Hee.

1685
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,510
She's crying.

1686
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,650
- Why is Kwang Soo so embarrassed? - Hey.

1687
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,850
I was never turned off by someone so instantly.

1688
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,020
It was embarrassing.

1689
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,020
I did it so that you could have some meat.

1690
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,790
(After her first difficulty, their meal is over.)

1691
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,730
This is where the World Shooting Championship...

1692
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,130
Changwon will be held this coming August.

1693
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,300
(It's the place where the championship will take place.)

1694
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,100
Is that water? What's that?

1695
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,900
- What? - Is there a penalty?

1696
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:56,570
(Water bombs for 6 people)

1697
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,370
- No way. - It's not time yet.

1698
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,510
- It's so cold today. - Come on.

1699
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,810
I will protect you from water.

1700
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,220
I'm suddenly cold after seeing the water.

1701
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:07,750
- It gets cold when there's water. - It's suddenly so cold.

1702
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,220
It's the last round of Romance Goes Away.

1703
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,320
It's the last mission to find true entertainment experts.

1704
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,490
It's called Rank the Numbers.

1705
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,490
(Rank the Numbers)

1706
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:19,400
- "Rank the Numbers"? - What's that?

1707
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,000
We need a chance to turn the tables.

1708
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,540
It's based on response from 200 single people from age 20 to 39.

1709
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,200
The team that guesses...

1710
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:31,410
answers that ranked first the most wins.

1711
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:32,480
This is important.

1712
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,380
There are seats numbered from 1 to 5 under water bombs,

1713
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:37,750
and there's one penalty seat.

1714
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,220
Upon hearing the question,

1715
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,290
take a seat based on the answer that ranked first in 30 minutes.

1716
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,820
Answer and penalty seats will get the water bomb.

1717
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:47,820
(Water falls on answer and penalty seats.)

1718
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:50,930
The person who answers correctly wins a point.

1719
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:54,460
- You can get a point? - It's better to be correct.

1720
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,870
I like this.

1721
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:58,270
Somin is an entertainment expert.

1722
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,770
I know all about romance.

1723
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,670
The first question will be given to women.

1724
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:05,510
- Women including Sang Yeob. - Sang Yeob is considered a woman.

1725
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,210
Somin, you're an expert. Answer it correctly.

1726
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,250
Okay, Jae Seok.

1727
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:12,120
- Here you go, sir. - Okay, thank you.

1728
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,280
- Thank you, Manager Lee. - You can do it.

1729
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,790
- This question was asked... - Let's go.

1730
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,990
to 100 single women from the age 20 to 39.

1731
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,530
You must answer it correctly, Somin.

1732
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:27,400
The first question will be on the monitor.

1733
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,030
"Which comment that men make turns you off?"

1734
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:32,800
- Okay. - I know this.

1735
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,000
It's number one.

1736
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,140
- Right. - It's unclear.

1737
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,640
I think it's number four.

1738
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:39,480
(Somin guesses number 4.)

1739
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,480
Number one.

1740
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
Isn't this it, Ji Hyo?

1741
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,480
(Isn't it number 1?)

1742
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,150
- Women hate number one. - Okay.

1743
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,420
- Which one? - Which comment turns you off?

1744
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:48,750
- It's a comment that turns you off. - Right.

1745
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,890
- "I'm not in the mood to talk." - Which one do you think it is?

1746
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,160
Number two?

1747
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,330
Saying "I'm busy," makes women feel bad.

1748
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:58,530
It's not a comment that turns you off.

1749
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,230
- No. - It's either 4 or 5.

1750
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,230
Listen.

1751
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,400
How about each of you say a line?

1752
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:05,940
- They'll do it. - Say a line each.

1753
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,940
Number one.

1754
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:09,370
"Fine, let's say that I was wrong."

1755
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:11,880
- Goodness. - "Let's say that I was wrong."

1756
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,310
(It's a big turn-off.)

1757
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:14,740
Even I feel angry.

1758
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,650
(He's my partner, but it's terrible.)

1759
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,780
Even I feel angry.

1760
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,750
How about number two?

1761
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,520
"I don't feel like talking."

1762
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,820
Women would casually say, "Okay."

1763
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,920
- What about number three? - That sounds okay.

1764
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:29,330
I don't think that's it.

1765
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:31,490
- I don't think it's number two. - "I was busy."

1766
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:34,300
- How about number three? - "I was busy."

1767
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,030
- "I don't feel like talking." - Right.

1768
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:37,870
- They hate number one the most. - Right.

1769
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:38,900
How about number four?

1770
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:41,200
"What's wrong this time?"

1771
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,610
("What's wrong this time?")

1772
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:45,280
- It's terrible. - I hate this one.

1773
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,510
I hate it too.

1774
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,640
He hates it too.

1775
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:49,480
What about number five?

1776
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,750
- Here's number five. - Go.

1777
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:53,580
"I said that I'm sorry, so what's wrong?"

1778
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,090
- I feel upset. - Come on.

1779
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,950
- They're good. - It gets more confusing.

1780
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:00,020
Excuse me.

1781
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,990
Aren't you upset by who said them?

1782
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:05,430
They seem upset by men who said them.

1783
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:08,060
- Didn't I sound too realistic? - Right.

1784
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:10,100
It could depend on the man's looks.

1785
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,770
Are you ready?

1786
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,370
- Get ready. - It may be unexpected.

1787
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,810
- Set. - It's up to you.

1788
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:18,040
- Number two? - I'll go, Jong Kook.

1789
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,610
- Here I go. - Get ready.

1790
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,610
Start.

1791
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,680
Somin, Somin.

1792
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,050
- Number one is empty. - Why doesn't anyone take it?

1793
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,150
(Run fast, Somin.)

1794
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,220
(It's my seat.)

1795
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:31,220
Somin, come on.

1796
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:33,220
(Only the penalty seat remains.)

1797
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,220
Look at Somin.

1798
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,490
Come on.

1799
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,360
I couldn't take that seat.

1800
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:38,760
It's not number three.

1801
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:41,400
(Sang Yeob 1, Hanna 2, Jin Young 3, Da Hee 4, Ji Hyo 5)

1802
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,070
(Shall I take my chance?)

1803
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:44,530
- Hey. - Da Hee.

1804
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,100
How dare you do something so terrible?

1805
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,210
(How dare you do something so terrible?)

1806
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:52,540
You.

1807
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,680
- Get off my seat. - "How dare you..."

1808
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,680
"do that"?

1809
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,420
Where did you learn it?

1810
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,120
"How dare you do that?"

1811
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,490
She learned it from Running Man.

1812
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:08,730
Somin, have you done something terrible to Da Hee?

1813
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:11,330
No, you can't do things like this.

1814
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:14,060
- Seriously. - What she said is what guests...

1815
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,500
say that turns me off the most.

1816
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:19,140
(Her comment turns him off the most.)

1817
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,500
- That was incredible. - What's wrong with you?

1818
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,740
"Where did you learn this from?"

1819
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,040
- No. - I'm dumbfounded.

1820
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,480
Responded by 100 single women from age 20 to 39,

1821
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,550
which comment that men make turns you off the most?

1822
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,850
35 percent of women chose the comment that ranked 1st.

1823
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,020
(35 percent of women chose the comment that ranked 1st.)

1824
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:39,020
It's number four.

1825
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:40,660
It's number one.

1826
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,330
1, 2, 3.

1827
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,860
What?

1828
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,860
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee answered correctly.)

1829
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:50,130
- It's number four. - I knew it.

1830
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:51,170
It's number four.

1831
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,200
- I knew it. - Number four is correct.

1832
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,770
(Somin gets scolded and drenched.)

1833
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:00,110
It was number four, Somin. You should have taken the seat.

1834
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,310
- It's because of "this time". - I know.

1835
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,280
- Right. - That's what they hate.

1836
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,150
The phrase "this time" makes you feel bad.

1837
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:10,620
When we said the comments out loud,

1838
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,390
- people reacted immediately. - Right.

1839
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,490
What Jae Seok suggested was very helpful.

1840
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:18,390
You reacted, but the staff also reacted.

1841
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:19,800
- They reacted a lot. - Right.

1842
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,030
"What's wrong this time?"

1843
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:26,040
(It sounds terrible.)

1844
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,270
- That comment makes you feel bad. - Really?

1845
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,010
Ji Hyo seems particularly sensitive to it.

1846
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:33,940
- The phrase "this time"... - Right.

1847
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,310
- hurts women's feelings. - "What's wrong this time?"

1848
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,110
Is it okay without "this time"?

1849
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:39,780
"Why are you doing that?" is okay.

1850
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:42,120
Not "What is it this time?"

1851
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,790
That makes me sound like a weird person.

1852
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:44,950
I get disgusted by that.

1853
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:47,560
- What if we say it more politely? - How?

1854
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,290
"What is it this time, ma'am?"

1855
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:51,660
(He sounds like an old person.)

1856
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:52,830
I think it's good.

1857
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:53,960
Why would you do that?

1858
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,130
That doesn't make you feel bad, right?

1859
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,770
"What is it this time, ma'am?"

1860
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:57,870
(It sounds old but friendly.)

1861
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:59,170
"What is it this time, ma'am?"

1862
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,200
"What is it this time, ma'am?"

1863
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,840
On the other hand,

1864
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:04,770
is there something women say...

1865
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,310
that make men feel bad?

1866
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,910
- I have one. - What is it?

1867
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,150
"You're so ugly."

1868
01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:11,410
(It comes from experience.)

1869
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:12,550
Really?

1870
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:14,550
In what way?

1871
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,020
It was a serious situation.

1872
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,250
What about this?

1873
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:18,590
"What do you know?"

1874
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:20,290
- I think I know what you mean. - "What do you know?"

1875
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,390
Maybe you got looked down a lot.

1876
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:24,530
"What do you know, Se Chan?"

1877
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,560
Why are you tearing up?

1878
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:26,600
Why can't I just speak?

1879
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,300
"What do you know, Se Chan?"

1880
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:30,330
What do you mean? I know how things work.

1881
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:33,200
- "What do you know?" - Did women say that to you?

1882
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,840
And this too. "You think you're a man?"

1883
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:39,840
"You have some pride of a man."

1884
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,310
- Se Chan, whom did you date? - Men hate that.

1885
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,880
Hey, bring her here.

1886
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,120
How are you doing?

1887
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,880
(I'm sorry for thinking I was a man.)

1888
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:49,350
- "What do you know?" - I know.

1889
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,490
- "What do you know, Se Chan?" - "You think you're a man?"

1890
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,620
He has resentment.

1891
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:53,790
Next question...

1892
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,760
was also answered by 200 unmarried men and women...

1893
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,130
between the age of 20 to 39.

1894
01:09:57,130 --> 01:09:58,130
Okay.

1895
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,700
- Here's the question. - We have to win.

1896
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:02,400
"Looking at my ex's social media".

1897
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,000
What about number four?

1898
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,270
- That one's insane. - That's not the answer.

1899
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:07,470
Number two is really bad too.

1900
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,640
"Asking for old gifts back".

1901
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,770
- Goodness. - What a loser.

1902
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:12,340
I get so disgusted by that.

1903
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:14,080
Pretending to be happy?

1904
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,250
The top choice had 40.5 percent of votes.

1905
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:17,810
They were adamant.

1906
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,280
- 40 percent? - Excuse me,

1907
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:23,590
but I apply to all of these cases. What do I do?

1908
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,260
- What you think is the worst. - You did all of them?

1909
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:28,060
I did all five of them. Which one do I choose?

1910
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:30,630
Number four is really bad.

1911
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:33,160
I know. Who asks for the gifts back?

1912
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,830
- Jong Kook. - People do that.

1913
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,900
- People do that. - It happens.

1914
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,270
- Expensive gifts. - Don't look down on them!

1915
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,070
(Those people do exist!)

1916
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,840
Just because you don't do it, don't look down on those who do.

1917
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:45,110
- Gosh. - Some people do that.

1918
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,680
"Don't look down on them."

1919
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:48,410
Please pick a representative.

1920
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:49,910
- All right. - I'll go.

1921
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:51,250
- Somin. - We can do this.

1922
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,080
- People do that a lot. - Can you give us three points?

1923
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,290
- Which one? - You can do whatever you think.

1924
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,320
(Go with number 4.)

1925
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:00,160
- It's up to you. - Okay.

1926
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,820
- It's up to you. - You can pick whatever.

1927
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,990
- Get ready, set... - Be quick, Somin.

1928
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,530
(One person from each couple runs towards the answers.)

1929
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,560
Somin.

1930
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,070
- Somin. - Take the other one.

1931
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,630
(They get to the spot without fighting over it.)

1932
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:12,640
(Only Da Hee didn't get a spot.)

1933
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,040
- No way. - Da Hee.

1934
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,310
- What? - Steal it.

1935
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:18,070
- Should I steal it? - Da Hee, steal it.

1936
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,540
Steal it.

1937
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,780
(Okay, I'll do that.)

1938
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,110
(Give me that cushion.)

1939
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:25,180
Steal it.

1940
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,720
(She takes Hanna's cushion and runs away.)

1941
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,920
Go back.

1942
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,750
Stop it. Bring it back.

1943
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,620
You told Somin not to do it earlier.

1944
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:33,620
Sit down.

1945
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,430
That wasn't nice. I'm sorry.

1946
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,930
You're pretending to be nice.

1947
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,830
You told Somin not to do that.

1948
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:43,970
You're doing the same thing.

1949
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,270
Hey.

1950
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,200
- Were you going for number five? - Yes.

1951
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:50,570
Do you want to stand here on behalf of me?

1952
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:52,040
The rules don't allow that.

1953
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,180
- What? - The rules don't allow that.

1954
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:54,340
Really?

1955
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:55,950
You can do that.

1956
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,150
You can do that.

1957
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,980
- But the director said... - They said you can do it.

1958
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,750
Can I do that once then?

1959
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,390
He said you can't do that. We can't?

1960
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:05,290
He said you can't do that. We can't?

1961
01:12:05,290 --> 01:12:06,520
- I didn't say anything. - We can't?

1962
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,660
Whom are you talking to?

1963
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,660
- He said no. - He said we can't?

1964
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:10,690
Whom are you talking to?

1965
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:13,760
He's sneaky. No, Da Hee.

1966
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,800
- It's not true. - No?

1967
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,700
- Can we switch once? - Do it.

1968
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,870
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1969
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,640
Okay, let's do that.

1970
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,570
Rock-paper-scissors

1971
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,710
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1972
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:26,140
He lost.

1973
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:27,910
(No? We can't do this either?)

1974
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,810
I didn't say anything.

1975
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,280
(The director doesn't know what to say.)

1976
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,420
(We really can't?)

1977
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,050
(We can't do this?)

1978
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,490
Whom are you talking to?

1979
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,720
Forget it. I'll go back.

1980
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:39,920
He said we can't do that.

1981
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,490
I'm telling the truth, Da Hee.

1982
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,590
Oh, gosh.

1983
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,590
(You're impossible. I'll do it.)

1984
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:44,630
Goodness, Kwang Soo.

1985
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:46,860
I love how filthy you are.

1986
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,870
- Here's the answer. - Okay.

1987
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,070
It's unlikely, but let's go with number three.

1988
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:53,240
- Let's go. - One...

1989
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,300
(1st choice had 40.5 percent of votes.)

1990
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,240
- Number 5. - 2, 3.

1991
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:01,140
(Who will take the water bomb along with Da Hee?)

1992
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,180
Three.

1993
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,780
(Haha and Ji Hyo get it right.)

1994
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,790
- Haha. - Yes.

1995
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,850
(My partner is the best.)

1996
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,220
Let's go to Switzerland.

1997
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:13,720
They said we can't do that. The rules don't allow that.

1998
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,060
- Stop it. - That's what he really said.

1999
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:17,990
The most pathetic move was number one.

2000
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,560
But it's the easiest to act on.

2001
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,870
It's also cowardly.

2002
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,100
That's why it's 40 percent.

2003
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,470
Everybody does it.

2004
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:26,900
All right. Let's ask.

2005
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,140
What about you, Hanna?

2006
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,710
Two things applied to me.

2007
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:32,210
Number 1 and 5.

2008
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,710
Many people use KakaoTalk.

2009
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,810
What kind of profile photo would you post to look happy?

2010
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,480
Pictures of me on trips.

2011
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,980
(It's perfect to look happy.)

2012
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,220
That's so classic.

2013
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,360
- With a nice scenery. - Where you look happy?

2014
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,760
- What about you, Da Hee? - Sorry?

2015
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,020
How many applied to you?

2016
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,860
(Well...)

2017
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,630
- Maybe all of them? - All of them?

2018
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:53,600
- All of them. - I see.

2019
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,270
No, four of them.

2020
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,870
- Which one didn't you do? - Which one is it not?

2021
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,100
I can't date somebody I don't like out of anger.

2022
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:01,470
I love myself too much, so I won't do that.

2023
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:05,840
I can't date somebody I don't like out of anger.

2024
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,410
I can't do it out of anger.

2025
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:11,920
I plan how I date people.

2026
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,380
What about not dating?

2027
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:16,590
Maybe do something out of anger.

2028
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:18,050
- Eat something out of anger. - I know.

2029
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:19,390
- Eat by myself. - Out of anger...

2030
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,260
Punching yourself out of anger.

2031
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,660
That works.

2032
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,930
(Punching)

2033
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,700
"What a fool."

2034
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,230
Hold on.

2035
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,630
They asked for old gifts. It wasn't me. It was my ex.

2036
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:31,940
- Did you give them back? - Yes.

2037
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,870
- Really? - That's cheap. Just give it back.

2038
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,170
You're asking for them back...

2039
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:40,040
not because you want the gifts,

2040
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,680
but you're making an excuse to see the other person again.

2041
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:42,680
(You're trying to see the other person again.)

2042
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,750
You're trying to see them again?

2043
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,080
That's pathetic.

2044
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,720
- That's more pathetic. - That's pathetic.

2045
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,690
- How pathetic. - You're pathetic.

2046
01:14:48,690 --> 01:14:51,690
What do you know, punk?

2047
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,490
- It's because you love her so much. - Why would you do that?

2048
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:54,520
Just call them.

2049
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,160
It's because you love her so much.

2050
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,660
Worse thing is...

2051
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,700
getting the gifts back...

2052
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,600
and posting them online to resell them.

2053
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,200
(That's even more pathetic.)

2054
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,500
- That's the worst. - Hey.

2055
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,040
(That's so pathetic.)

2056
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,740
When my friends broke up,

2057
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,810
we would go to them and share the gifts.

2058
01:15:11,810 --> 01:15:12,980
If you broke up,

2059
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,380
all my friends would go together and take the gifts.

2060
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,680
"I take this."

2061
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,480
(What?)

2062
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,480
"I take this."

2063
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,750
I'm sorry for saying this, but why did you do that?

2064
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,260
Why would you take your friends and blow it out of proportion?

2065
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,920
They don't need the gifts anymore,

2066
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:28,930
so we divided them.

2067
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:30,460
- That's possible. - You won't use them again.

2068
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:32,330
- It's possible. - Give us one last question.

2069
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:33,400
Last question.

2070
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,060
Give us 2 to 3 points.

2071
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,500
Should we make this two points?

2072
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,030
- Give us 2 points. - Let's do 2 points.

2073
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:39,340
This question is worth two points.

2074
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,500
- That sounds good. - Pick a representative.

2075
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,040
This question...

2076
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,570
was answered by 100 unmarried women...

2077
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:46,110
between the age of 20 to 39.

2078
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,340
That's an advantage for us.

2079
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:48,750
Unmarried women?

2080
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:50,150
This is what women think.

2081
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,250
(What is something men do that makes your heart flutter?)

2082
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,750
I read this somewhere a few days ago.

2083
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,820
- It's something small. - This is so difficult.

2084
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,620
Isn't it number one? It has to be.

2085
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:58,660
I say number five.

2086
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:00,690
(I pick number 5. I'm certain.)

2087
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,360
- What is it? - Number four.

2088
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,530
Did you pick one person?

2089
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:06,500
Don't women like it when somebody you like pats your head?

2090
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,000
Some people hate getting their hair ruined.

2091
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,400
- Should we start? - Yes, let's go.

2092
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,340
- Did you choose one person? - Yes, we did.

2093
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,040
You have to win, okay?

2094
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,410
She gives me an order and leaves.

2095
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,280
But she's always wrong.

2096
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,940
Jong Kook is always right.

2097
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,480
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2098
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,850
- Let's go. - Please step on the white line.

2099
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,720
You automatically lose if you cheat.

2100
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,190
- Get ready. - Jong Kook, how far are you going?

2101
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:32,720
What?

2102
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,390
I think we're going in different directions.

2103
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,530
Do you think so?

2104
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,990
I think we're going in different directions.

2105
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:39,030
We're going in different directions.

2106
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:40,960
Please step on the white line. If you cheat,

2107
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,270
you automatically go to number six.

2108
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:43,370
Set...

2109
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:44,870
(They run towards the spots.)

2110
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:45,900
Kwang Soo.

2111
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,500
Kwang Soo.

2112
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,540
(Number 1, 2, and 3 didn't involve much fighting.)

2113
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:52,940
Please, Jae Seok.

2114
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:54,810
I sat down.

2115
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,650
(Sang Yeob ran to the penalty spot, so he has nowhere to go.)

2116
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,750
(He's forced to receive the penalty.)

2117
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,520
Sang Yeob!

2118
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:09,230
- What do we do? - Lies! This is a lie.

2119
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,930
I hope I'm right.

2120
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:13,200
We'll turn the game around. This is the final round.

2121
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,770
I think it's between number 3 and 5.

2122
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,400
- No, it's number five. - Really?

2123
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:18,640
It's number five, Jae Seok.

2124
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:20,800
This might be right. It's the most simple.

2125
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,110
- I know. - Number two?

2126
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,070
- Number 2? - What if it's 5?

2127
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,140
(This question is worth 2 points. If you get it right, you win.)

2128
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:28,240
(What is something men do that makes your heart flutter?)

2129
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:30,510
- Two... - This is the final round.

2130
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:31,980
Kwang Soo.

2131
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,580
(Which couple will get the question right in the final round?)

2132
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,790
Three.

2133
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:39,160
("Remembering what I said". Jae Seok and Somin are right.)

2134
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,490
- It is five. - We won.

2135
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:41,960
(Remember what I said?)

2136
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:43,960
- See? - It's right.

2137
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,200
You're right.

2138
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,760
- I knew it. - I picked this one...

2139
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,270
because Somin told me.

2140
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,530
You say something casually,

2141
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,140
and if they remember it, it makes your heart flutter.

2142
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,070
- I told you it's number five. - Right.

2143
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,140
I thought number five was something you just do.

2144
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:59,910
(Glancing)

2145
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:01,780
48 percent picked this.

2146
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,880
Somin and Jae Seok won two points.

2147
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,020
That was fierce. We came from behind and won.

2148
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,020
(Jae Seok and Somin win Rank the Numbers.)

2149
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,290
"We came from behind and won."

2150
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:13,860
Let's go to the final location. That'll be the final mission.

2151
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,160
- Let's go. - Let's go over.

2152
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,560
(What will they do with the last Diamond Distribution Card?)

2153
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,730
- What's this? Where are we? - We can't have the same amount.

2154
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:21,970
Let's go.

2155
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:23,030
(What's waiting for them?)

2156
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,070
That's scary.

2157
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:26,400
Lucky.

2158
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,270
I would hate to go.

2159
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,010
I'm telling you. I won't go. I can't do it.

2160
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,410
I won't go.

2161
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,940
- I can't go. - You can't do this to us.

2162
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:36,250
- All right. - Okay.

2163
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,950
Jae Seok and Somin won Rank the Numbers,

2164
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,350
so I'll tell you if you're safe or in danger.

2165
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:42,620
Please come forward.

2166
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:45,020
- Jae Seok. - They won five points.

2167
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,320
- Take ours. - Good luck.

2168
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,230
- Do something unexpected. - Pick us.

2169
01:18:50,290 --> 01:18:53,260
Currently, you two are...

2170
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,600
dangerous with the highest number.

2171
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,640
- This is too dangerous. - I know.

2172
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,970
Two teams have the same number, right?

2173
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:02,840
2 teams have the same number, and the lowest number is 3.

2174
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:05,610
- I think they'll push hard. - I think they have 13.

2175
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,080
We can all survive, Jae Seok.

2176
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,140
(Please choose well.)

2177
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,350
If we make the wrong decision...

2178
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:11,450
(If they pick something uncertain, they might get the same number.)

2179
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,980
We might get the same number. We have to pick a team we know.

2180
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,120
- Let's pick Kwang Soo. - He gave us the diamonds.

2181
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,560
I think it's the most certain. If we pick somebody else,

2182
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,530
- we won't know, right? - That's true.

2183
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,260
(The two couples' fates lie in Jae Seok and Somin's hands.)

2184
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:28,330
Please bring your briefcase forward, Kwang Soo and Da Hee.

2185
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,630
Think again. You can save everybody.

2186
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,970
- Really? - Somin.

2187
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:34,370
- Good job, Jae Seok. - Think again.

2188
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,070
- Really? - Good choice.

2189
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,440
- You're so wise. - Everybody,

2190
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,010
we're not doing this as a payback.

2191
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,510
We don't know how many the other teams have.

2192
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:45,620
- I'll tell you. - We only have this information,

2193
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,320
so we have to take yours.

2194
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,320
Yes, that's enough.

2195
01:19:49,320 --> 01:19:50,590
(Accept it, losers.)

2196
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,790
Accept it.

2197
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,490
They really don't want to go.

2198
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,830
(Are you going to do this?)

2199
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,160
I'm sorry, Jae Seok.

2200
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,430
I looked back earlier,

2201
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,470
and your team was the only one that I thought wouldn't win.

2202
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,640
That's why I picked you, and in the end...

2203
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,370
Go away. Go.

2204
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,280
- But then... - You reap what you sow.

2205
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,410
- They might not be in last place. - Do we decide?

2206
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,410
You can decide how many you want to give them.

2207
01:20:18,410 --> 01:20:19,480
How many you'll give them.

2208
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,920
Why do we have so many?

2209
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,950
Let's...

2210
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:25,150
We can all survive, Jae Seok.

2211
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,190
Let's give them this many.

2212
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:29,460
(Let's send off this many.)

2213
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:33,760
(How many did they give Kwang Soo and Da Hee?)

2214
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,000
- The team with the lowest number... - The lowest number.

2215
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,900
That's three.

2216
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,500
- I think it's three. - It has to be.

2217
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,140
The team with the lowest number...

2218
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:46,780
(Which team has the least diamonds?)

2219
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,950
Seok Jin and Sang Yeob with three diamonds.

2220
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,810
Yes!

2221
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,280
(Seok Jin and Sang Yeob have the lowest number.)

2222
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:58,090
- I don't think more is better. - Should we take a lot?

2223
01:20:58,290 --> 01:20:59,460
Trust me. Three?

2224
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,790
Let's do three. Okay.

2225
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,160
(They kept 3 diamonds all day.)

2226
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,400
We should have taken six.

2227
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,300
We should have taken 6 or 7.

2228
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,770
The highest number...

2229
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:10,800
(The team with the highest number also gets the Shuddering Sticker.)

2230
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:17,310
(They wanted to escape this by giving their diamonds away.)

2231
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:18,410
Kwang Soo and Da Hee.

2232
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:21,340
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee have the highest number.)

2233
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:22,850
They took it all back.

2234
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:25,050
That's exactly right.

2235
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:27,380
- Good job. - They're so sneaky.

2236
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,950
- Good job. - And...

2237
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:34,160
from the four remaining teams,

2238
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,890
two teams have the same numbers.

2239
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,630
- Please not this one. - Please, no.

2240
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:38,800
Please.

2241
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,600
(The teams with the same numbers get the Shuddering Stickers.)

2242
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:43,900
If you don't have the same number, you get the Luxury Stickers.

2243
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:45,340
Please.

2244
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:47,670
- Please, not this. - The teams with the same numbers...

2245
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,710
Please, we can't be the two teams.

2246
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,770
I really want to win.

2247
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,080
I don't think they will lose.

2248
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:55,780
The teams with the same number...

2249
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:58,110
are Jong Kook and Jin Young, and Jae Seok and Somin.

2250
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,420
(These two couples have the same numbers.)

2251
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,020
(Why did we get the same number?)

2252
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,150
You fool.

2253
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,220
(Haha and Ji Hyo, and Se Chan and Hanna get Luxury Stickers.)

2254
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,260
They switched.

2255
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:10,960
(How did they end up like this?)

2256
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,600
I think it's bad to have the same number.

2257
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:15,970
- Let's do seven. - Okay.

2258
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:18,640
- You wanted 7. - 2 more.

2259
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:21,540
That makes us 7, and Jae Seok has 13.

2260
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,140
Then nobody has the same numbers.

2261
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,740
We'll give them seven more.

2262
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,640
Please focus, Da Hee.

2263
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,080
(We got the same number again.)

2264
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,310
I'm bad with numbers.

2265
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,350
Let's give them six.

2266
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,780
(Let's give six to Kwang Soo and Da Hee.)

2267
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:38,290
(They are bad with numbers too, so they ended up with 7 diamonds.)

2268
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:41,620
(That's how Jong Kook and Jae Seok both ended up with 7.)

2269
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:44,130
3 teams had 10 diamonds,

2270
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:46,000
- so that's why we did that. - Don't even talk to him.

2271
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,600
- I thought we were going to win. - Let's go to Switzerland.

2272
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,000
We had the same number,

2273
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,170
and now we have the same number.

2274
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:52,440
(Jong Kook's team got away and got stuck with Jae Seok's team.)

2275
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,300
I didn't think about that.

2276
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,270
- I thought we were going to win. - Let's go to Switzerland.

2277
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:59,410
Four people will go on the Luxury Package.

2278
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:00,710
That means we have space for two more people.

2279
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:01,980
That's right.

2280
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:03,410
2 more people. There are 2 more spots.

2281
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:05,320
- There are spots. - What?

2282
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:06,550
- There are two more spots? - Yes.

2283
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,780
- They only have four people. - Really?

2284
01:23:07,780 --> 01:23:09,120
That's right.

2285
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,390
This is your last chance to avoid the Shuddering Package.

2286
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:13,620
This is called Back to the Future.

2287
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:16,790
In the briefcases in front of you...

2288
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:19,130
are Exemption Card, Shuddering Package Card,

2289
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:22,400
and Shuddering Package Plus One Card.

2290
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,570
You can do rock-paper-scissors and decide who goes first.

2291
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:26,470
Each couple will pick a briefcase.

2292
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,240
If somebody picks the Exemption Card first,

2293
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,710
they get the Luxury Sticker. The rest lose.

2294
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:33,480
(The couple that picks the Exemption Card wins.)

2295
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,780
- We can do this, Seok Jin. - Okay.

2296
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,250
We have to win.

2297
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,710
(There's an advantage to picking the briefcase first.)

2298
01:23:37,710 --> 01:23:39,520
You have to win rock-paper-scissors.

2299
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,720
- No. - I'll do it.

2300
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,150
- I'll go. - Go.

2301
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,120
If you lose, you don't get to choose.

2302
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:45,960
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2303
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,860
(Only Jae Seok is "paper".)

2304
01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:50,090
- Yes. - I win.

2305
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,290
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2306
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:55,430
(Jae Seok and Somin lose. They get the Shuddering Sticker.)

2307
01:23:56,370 --> 01:23:58,540
- You don't get to pick. - It's him again.

2308
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,100
(They don't get to pick. They get the Shuddering Sticker.)

2309
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:01,170
He's so unlucky.

2310
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,440
(Sighing)

2311
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:04,410
(How does that feel?)

2312
01:24:04,410 --> 01:24:05,580
This is the worst.

2313
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,610
Somin,

2314
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,710
- you should get away from Jae Seok. - Somin.

2315
01:24:09,950 --> 01:24:11,580
You shouldn't be in the same team as me.

2316
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,320
- Gosh, I'll never do it again. - This is the worst.

2317
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,050
- We make the worst team. - I know.

2318
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,790
This is the worst.

2319
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:22,260
- We make the worst team. - Please continue.

2320
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:23,960
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2321
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,830
(Seok Jin and Sang Yeob are in 1st place.)

2322
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,030
Rock-paper-scissors

2323
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:30,600
(Jong Kook and Jin Young are in 2nd place.)

2324
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,240
- It's possible. - It's okay. We can win.

2325
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:34,370
(Let's pick the Exemption Card.)

2326
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,670
If Seok Jin picks the Exemption Card, this is over.

2327
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:38,110
- Can I pick? - Go ahead.

2328
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,140
I'll pick.

2329
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,180
(Sang Yeob is confident, so he wants to choose.)

2330
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,380
If you pick the bad card, you get the Shuddering Sticker.

2331
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,720
If you pick the Shuddering Package Plus One Card,

2332
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,420
you can choose another team to go with you.

2333
01:24:48,620 --> 01:24:51,320
- I think it's this one. - This one?

2334
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,190
What about you? What do you think? You'll pick.

2335
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,690
They want this one, so I pick this.

2336
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,660
Okay. I have a bad feeling about this.

2337
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:00,800
Sang Yeob is not lucky today. Maybe you should switch.

2338
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:04,070
You never know. The sun rises out of nowhere.

2339
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,770
- It's true. - He can't be unlucky forever.

2340
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:08,570
- How will I keep living? - I trust you, Sang Yeob.

2341
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:10,040
If they pick the Exemption Card,

2342
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,670
- we all get the penalty? - It'll be over then.

2343
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:14,510
- Just go with what you picked. - Let's go.

2344
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,180
- You can't be unlucky forever. - Let's go.

2345
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:19,080
(They open the 1st briefcase that'll decide the 3 teams' fates.)

2346
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,420
(If Sang Yeob picks the Exemption Card, it's game over.)

2347
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,850
(His team will get the Luxury Sticker.)

2348
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:26,890
(If he picks the Shuddering Package Card or Plus One Card,)

2349
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,790
(his team will get the Shuddering Sticker.)

2350
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:32,160
(There's 1 in 3 chance. Will Sang Yeob finally get lucky?)

2351
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,630
Oh, my goodness.

2352
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,030
- Hurry up. - Let's go.

2353
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:37,670
You can't be unlucky forever.

2354
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:38,940
- Let's go. - Here it is.

2355
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:00,060
(They open the 1st briefcase that'll decide the 3 teams' fates.)

2356
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,290
(If Sang Yeob picks the Exemption Card, it's game over.)

2357
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,490
(His team will get the Luxury Sticker.)

2358
01:26:04,630 --> 01:26:05,930
- Hurry. - Let's go.

2359
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:07,460
You can't be unlucky forever.

2360
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,700
- Let's go. - Here it is.

2361
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:12,170
(Seok Jin and Sang Yeob get the Shuddering Sticker.)

2362
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,700
(Thank you, Sang Yeob.)

2363
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,770
Yes.

2364
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:17,740
This is insane.

2365
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,380
Sang Yeob is insane.

2366
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,950
(That's right. It's possible to be unlucky until the end.)

2367
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,610
How can you be unlucky until the end?

2368
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:24,950
(That's right. It's possible to be unlucky until the end.)

2369
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,980
(Thanks to Sang Yeob's bad luck,)

2370
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:28,750
(they have a better chance of getting the Exemption Card.)

2371
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,290
- Poor you. - This is great.

2372
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:32,060
I'm getting my hopes up.

2373
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,690
He's the leader of unlucky people.

2374
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,960
He's the leader of unlucky people.

2375
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,460
(Seok Jin and Sang Yeob get the Shuddering Sticker.)

2376
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:40,930
- We're almost there. - One more time.

2377
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:42,070
Let's win one more time.

2378
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,400
One is the Exemption Card, and the other one is the penalty.

2379
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,100
You can also pick another team.

2380
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,240
I think it's this one.

2381
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,470
(I have a feeling.)

2382
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,570
I'll pick the other one then.

2383
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:52,980
- I think it's that one. - Sang Yeob is bad luck.

2384
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,180
- Jin Young. - Yes?

2385
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,880
- Goodbye - Goodbye

2386
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,980
- I'm leaving - Goodbye

2387
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,150
If they pick the penalty, this is over.

2388
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:03,690
Please pick Plus One.

2389
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:06,220
- Open it right away. - In 1, 2, 3

2390
01:27:06,220 --> 01:27:08,490
(This briefcase will decide who gets the Luxury Sticker.)

2391
01:27:08,490 --> 01:27:10,630
(If they pick the Shuddering Package Plus One Card,)

2392
01:27:10,630 --> 01:27:13,160
(they automatically join Jae Seok and Somin.)

2393
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,200
(If it's the Exemption Card, they get the Luxury Stickers.)

2394
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:19,570
(There are only 2 spots left.)

2395
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:23,510
(Which couple will come one step closer to enjoying this dream?)

2396
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,340
In 1, 2, 3.

2397
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:26,740
Exemption Card.

2398
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,750
(Jong Kook and Jin Young pick the Exemption Card.)

2399
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:30,850
2, 3.

2400
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:31,920
Exemption Card.

2401
01:27:33,150 --> 01:27:34,650
This is crazy.

2402
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:37,750
(I did it, Jong Kook.)

2403
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:40,220
(She's excited.)

2404
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,460
Exemption Card.

2405
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:42,760
(Jong Kook and Jin Young get the last 2 Luxury Stickers.)

2406
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,160
(That couple is so lucky.)

2407
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:48,200
(He avoids her.)

2408
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:51,300
You should have won rock-paper-scissors.

2409
01:27:51,630 --> 01:27:53,570
(Don't you think that's what I wanted too?)

2410
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:55,170
- You met the right woman. - Jong Kook.

2411
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,410
- Be good to me. - Okay.

2412
01:27:56,410 --> 01:27:57,440
- All right? - Yes.

2413
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,470
(Kwang Soo and Da Hee get the Shuddering Stickers.)

2414
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,840
Okay.

2415
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,510
Goodbye

2416
01:28:02,510 --> 01:28:05,220
After the first week,

2417
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:07,380
- the results have come out. - I'm sick of this group.

2418
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:08,890
Who went to see the crocodiles?

2419
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:12,260
(It's me.)

2420
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,890
Who went to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

2421
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:17,230
- Me. - Me too.

2422
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:18,800
Who went to Indonesia?

2423
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,130
(I went to Indonesia too.)

2424
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:21,800
Who had soba?

2425
01:28:22,070 --> 01:28:23,300
- Team Soba. - Me.

2426
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,970
- Osaka. - Osaka.

2427
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:27,600
(They went on all the penalty trips.)

2428
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,640
This is strange. Why does it keep happening?

2429
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,910
He made all the decisions today.

2430
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,680
- He made all the decisions. - He's the worst.

2431
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,950
- It was all him. - Sang Yeob was in the heart of it.

2432
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:40,280
Even I find it hard to believe.

2433
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,490
- You are the unluckiest. - How am I supposed to live?

2434
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,120
Don't ask me. You are responsible for your own life.

2435
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:46,560
(How am I supposed to know?)

2436
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,420
Sir!

2437
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,760
- For goodness' sake. - He abandoned me.

2438
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,660
This isn't the end. We still have three weeks.

2439
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,370
- We don't know what will happen. - Right. This is the beginning.

2440
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:59,940
This is the beginning. And Somin,

2441
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:01,270
- let's not team up from now on. - Seriously.

2442
01:29:01,270 --> 01:29:03,110
Make sure the two of them are a team.

2443
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:05,140
- That's the best option. - It's the worst combination.

2444
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,340
It's the worst combination.

2445
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,110
See you next week!

2446
01:29:08,110 --> 01:29:09,780
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2447
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:11,350
(Look forward to the 2nd week of Family Project.)

(Team Bobsleigh)

2451
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,090

(Team Song of curling)

2453
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,360

01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,200
(Are there more athletes?)

2458
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,300
Are more people coming?

2459
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:35,040
(The real Olympic heroes are here.)

2460

(Team Skeleton, Yun Sung Bin and Kim Ji Soo)

2461
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,680

2462
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,680
(Okay.)

2463
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:43,480
(They are the fittest men...)

2464
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,350
(who can fly on land.)

2465
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:47,850
This is embarrassing.

2466
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:49,690
(It finally happens.)

2467
01:29:49,690 --> 01:29:51,920

2470
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,590
(among the athletes.)

2471
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,300
They are among us.

2472
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:02,730
(The athletes are chased...)

2473
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,000
