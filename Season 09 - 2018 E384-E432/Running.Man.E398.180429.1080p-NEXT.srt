1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,301
(Last week's special was TV Rating Notice Part 2.)

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,811
(The first TV rating notice centered around Jae Seok.)

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,481
(After running it for 3 months, they will film a new notice.)

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,081
"The Boy Frog".

5
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,880
(8 members of Running Man presented their own storyboards.)

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,720
(To be in the limelight of the second TV rating notice, )

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,491
(dirty plays by the members were seen during missions with guests.)

8
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:31,761
(Members won points from missions by deceiving each other.)

9
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,290
(And with the accumulated points, )

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,790
(the last battle will unfold.)

11
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,281
(The member who wants the notice must endure the weight of the job.)

12
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,940
(Which member will get to direct the second TV rating notice?)

13
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:47,411
(The director of the 2nd notice will be revealed soon with the clip.)

14
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:49,811
(And it's a special day today.)

15
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:56,650
(It's spring in the popular place for retreats, Daeseong-ri.)

16
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,781
- Hello. Goodness.
- Hi. My gosh.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,250
- What is that?
- Hey, there's a cake. I see a cake.

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,391
"Se Chan and So Min".

19
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,491
- Is it their birthdays?
- What is this?

20
00:01:04,491 --> 00:01:06,260
- It's their 1-year anniversary.
- It's their 1-year anniversary.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,560
- It's been a year already?
- Yes, it's been a year now.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,200
(An abundance of food is served outdoors to celebrate the occasion.)

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,030
- So Min and Se Chan's Anniversary.
- It's been a year now.

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,790
- They will come down from there.
- My gosh.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,760
(Everything is ready to celebrate their first-year anniversary.)

26
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,540
- Hey, hold on.
- This one is delicious too.

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,180
- Right?
- The sandwiches look delicious.

28
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,280
- What?
- The sandwiches look tasty.

29
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,751
(Screaming)

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,450
(What's going on?)

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,590
- What is that?
- Come on.

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,191
- What are you doing?
- You've got to be kidding me.

33
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,491
- You guys are hilarious.
- They didn't have to go that far.

34
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,967
- What are you doing?
- This is like a comedy skit.

35
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:40,991
You guys are ridiculous. My goodness.

36
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,530
- Look at So Min.
- Come on. Play along, guys.

37
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,560
They are so annoying.

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,280
(It's all thanks to your love and support.)

39
00:01:48,101 --> 00:01:49,631
("Gapyeong", "Are They in Cannes?", "Dressing up Like Celebrities")

40
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,471
What is So Min doing? What's wrong with her?

41
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,771
Hey, what are you doing?

42
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:55,741
Hey, you two. What's the matter with you?

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,840
- So Min. Se Chan. come here.
- My gosh.

44
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,881
Look at the table.

45
00:01:58,881 --> 00:01:59,956
- My gosh.
- You prepared all this?

46
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,881
- Congratulations.
- Good work.

47
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,581
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

48
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,980
- Running Man...
- It's been a year already?

49
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,991
- I know, right?
- It's already been a year.

50
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,191
- Yes, a year has already passed.
- We were in the container...

51
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,520
- That happened a year ago?
- A year ago. Yes.

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
- It's been a year.
- I can see that...

53
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:14,531
(April 3, 2017, at the filming of Running Man)

54
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,460
(Their first day was absurd and difficult.)

55
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,401
(The youngest members brought new chemistries and energy to the show.)

56
00:02:22,871 --> 00:02:25,640
They joined the show when we were having the hardest time.

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,311
That's so true. You are our lucky charms.

58
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,341
- You two were of big help.
- Right, right.

59
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,341
(The driving force of the show's newfound popularity)

60
00:02:31,341 --> 00:02:33,181
I like today's special.

61
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,450
It's their first-year anniversary. And the high-school rapper is here.

62
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,621
Jae Seok, it must be time to bring out the shorts now.

63
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:43,890
- Ji Hyo, my gosh.
- Hey, Ji Hyo.

64
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:45,821
- Did something happen?
- You ripped the pants, didn't you?

65
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:49,230
- She ripped them herself.
- I must wear shorts by the river.

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
- Hey, look at Seok Jin.
- What?

67
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,770
- He wore a cardigan on a hot day.
- Hey.

68
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,471
- One of us isn't wearing...
- It's hot today.

69
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,571
Adventurous outfits now.

70
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,170
- People wear it at nursing homes.
- It's for spring. It's spring now.

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,210
(An outfit for nursing homes)

72
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,411
Hey, you! You'd better watch out.

73
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,580
- He didn't wear it to look young.
- Hey, you.

74
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,751
- Pigeon Gramps.
- "Pigeon Gramps"?

75
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,651
- Why?
- You know nothing about fashion.

76
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:12,781
- My gosh, Kwang Soo.
- What?

77
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,790
Don't you wear that in "Live"?

78
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,790
- No, no.
- Yeom Sang Soo.

79
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,360
- My gosh.
- Is the drama still on?

80
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,031
- I feel really bad though.
- Why?

81
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,907
- Jung Hae In has all the attention.
- He's the best!

82
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,631
- He's awesome.
- He's really getting popular now.

83
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:26,360
- I agree.
- My gosh, he's the best.

84
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,901
- I really like him.
- "Something in the Rain".

85
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,640
Hae In is so popular these days.

86
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,601
Kwang Soo could've gotten more attention too.

87
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:35,040
He doesn't have a love interest. Give him one.

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,911
- He needs kissing scenes too.
- He just has a crush on someone.

89
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,640
- He should have kissing scenes.
- Right.

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,510
Exactly. It's always unrequited love with him. It's frustrating.

91
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,281
Upload a video of your kissing someone on your social media.

92
00:03:44,281 --> 00:03:46,591
(Upload a video of your kissing someone on your social media.)

93
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,721
(Do it on a "live" streaming show.)

94
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:50,260
What do you mean? Why would I do that?

95
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,167
- They didn't give you the scenes.
- Yes, do it.

96
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,691
Jung Hae In and I are on different paths.

97
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,990
Precisely. I'm happy that Kwang Soo realized that.

98
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,501
- I'm so relieved.
- Hae In will be like Joong Ki.

99
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:01,471
- He'll be categorized with Bo Gum.
- Right.

100
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,371
- That's right.
- They will take their own paths.

101
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,770
Kwang Soo will follow after me. He will star on "Reverse Drama".

102
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,170
- Why would I star on that?
- I was on that show.

103
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,410
- Why would I star on that show?
- I acted on that show.

104
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,811
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes?

105
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,580
I did what you're doing now on that show.

106
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,881
No, I can't take that path.

107
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,251
- You make me very proud.
- That show isn't...

108
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,350
- Thank you.
- I'm happy that my fellow...

109
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,390
- comedian is a good actor.
- Wait.

110
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,390
He was a comedian?

111
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,791
- Did you not know?
- He was a comedian?

112
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,631
- Hey, pay your dues for the club.
- Yes, you should.

113
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,390
- Why? I'm not a comedian!
- You're a comedian.

114
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,400
Seriously.

115
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,760
- Why would I pay the dues?
- Pay your dues, man.

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,871
My gosh, he can be so frustrating.

117
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,900
Hey, So Min. You might get an offer for a farting commercial.

118
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,171
Jae Seok.

119
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,311
(That stupid farting.)

120
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,010
(So Min was in the midst of a scandal regarding her farting.)

121
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:52,251
I saw the keyword "So Min's farting" trending online.

122
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:55,551
I'm really sad that my related terms...

123
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:58,921
are "farting" and "gas".

124
00:05:00,631 --> 00:05:03,260
As you can see on the table, it's So Min and Se Chan's...

125
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,931
- first-year anniversary.
- Okay.

126
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,801
To celebrate their anniversary,

127
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:11,741
- For our anniversary? - we prepared Running 365 Retreat.

128
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,041
(Running 365 Retreat)

129
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,041
"365"?

130
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,470
"365"?

131
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,741
It's been 365 days.

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,111
That's why you can enjoy the retreat for 365 minutes here.

133
00:05:23,751 --> 00:05:27,350
You can come up with your own schedule for the retreat.

134
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,991
- That's great.
- Really?

135
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:31,791
However, you cannot do anything...

136
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,191
that's not on the schedule.

137
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,931
(However, you cannot do anything that's not on the schedule.)

138
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:37,361
You must come up with a detailed schedule...

139
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:39,030
- that includes bathroom breaks.
- Seriously?

140
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,001
Can't we have a bathroom break unless it's on the schedule?

141
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:45,041
Everyone's bladder runs on a different schedule.

142
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,441
So Min and Se Chan will write a schedule each.

143
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:50,910
The rest will write 2 schedules as 2 groups of 3.

144
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,210
In total, there will be four schedules.

145
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,150
(So Min, Se Chan, and the two groups)

146
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,421
What should we write?

147
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,051
(They begin writing the schedules for Running 365 Retreat.)

148
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,090
What?

149
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,421
Jong Kook, I see what Se Chan wrote.

150
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:07,631
What did he write?

151
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,001
- "Jong Kook grills pork belly."
- Stop it.

152
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:13,731
(Jong Kook grills pork belly.)

153
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,270
(Is that so?)

154
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,400
Is that so?

155
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,270
I can grill both pork belly and Se Chan.

156
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,770
(I can grill both pork belly and Se Chan.)

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,080
- May I have a new board?
- Suit yourself.

158
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:27,311
(Se Chan is in trouble.)

159
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't write Truth Game.

160
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,580
Truth Game is no fun.

161
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,080
- It's fun.
- Stop it.

162
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,720
- Why did you include Truth Game?
- It's no fun.

163
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,121
It's fun, Seok Jin.

164
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,520
- Erase it.
- Erase it.

165
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,090
After me, Seok Jin became the MC of "Truth Game".

166
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:42,390
(The topic of "Truth Game" saddens Seok Jin every time.)

167
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,830
Stop it.

168
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,760
Seok Jin was in "Truth Game".

169
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,371
- Are we talking about the past?
- That's right.

170
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,941
The show got canceled because of me.

171
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,241
The show got canceled because of me.

172
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:52,441
Let's play Mafia Game.

173
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,140
- That's a good idea.
- Find the Thief.

174
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,071
- Pass the Towel.
- Why would you play those games?

175
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:57,741
We can play in the water.

176
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:01,051
We will need a shower if we get wet. It's a hassle.

177
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:02,251
Treasure Hunt.

178
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,850
- We will need to hide the treasure.
- We played it for nine years.

179
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,421
Why are you complaining so much?

180
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:08,421
No matter what I suggest, you go, "I don't think it's a good idea."

181
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:10,890
"Let's do something else. I don't want to become sweaty."

182
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,090
You write it down!

183
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,890
We can write down "grill meat".

184
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,431
I don't suit this team.

185
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,100
(I don't suit this team.)

186
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,361
(He realizes it by watching Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

187
00:07:18,361 --> 00:07:19,530
I realize that now.

188
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:24,600
(What do their schedules look like?)

189
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,270
If everyone is done,

190
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,371
each team will now present their schedule for the retreat.

191
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:33,041
Please put it up on the board after the presentation.

192
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,481
- Now...
- Let's begin with Se Chan.

193
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:35,510
Me?

194
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,030
- Kim Kap Soo, please proceed.
- Okay.

195
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,520
I have...

196
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,321
(Sincere rolling paper, Jong Kook grills pork belly, )

197
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,390
(couple dance time, shower and bathroom break)

198
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,421
(Jong Kook grills beef, Foot volleyball)

199
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,131
I want to have a sincere rolling paper time.

200
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:48,660
(The first period)

201
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,207
- Rolling paper.
- There must be things...

202
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,861
we weren't able to say to each other.

203
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:54,600
Wouldn't it dampen our mood from the start?

204
00:07:54,671 --> 00:07:57,241
Aren't such sentimental moments more suitable during the nighttime?

205
00:07:57,241 --> 00:07:58,941
You haven't done it, have you?

206
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,010
It's my schedule.

207
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,710
The next one is...

208
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,840
couple dance time with music.

209
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:09,681
(For goodness' sake.)

210
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,850
We will become couples.

211
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,881
(What is wrong with him?)

212
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:15,321
Why would we become couples?

213
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,691
Write it again.

214
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,321
We don't know what will happen.

215
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,431
We will have that for an hour.

216
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:22,491
Before we go home, we can play foot volleyball.

217
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:25,200
(Before we go home, we can play foot volleyball.)

218
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,171
When you go to a retreat,

219
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,431
don't you do those things in reverse?

220
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,970
(Don't you do those things in reverse?)

221
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,171
Hold on.

222
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,141
We should start with foot volleyball and end with rolling paper.

223
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,380
The schedule needs to go backwards. It's only right.

224
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:41,610
That's right.

225
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,710
(It goes askew.)

226
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:44,821
(Can't he do anything right?)

227
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,151
For goodness' sake.

228
00:08:46,521 --> 00:08:48,120
(Flustered)

229
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,421
- Is that a difficult task?
- I am sorry.

230
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,497
- I am taking too much time.
- Is that a difficult task?

231
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,230
Se Chan, what are you doing?

232
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,867
(The briefing on Se Chan's schedule ends.)

233
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:57,600
- So Min.
- So Min.

234
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,630
I...

235
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,370
(Stay still without doing anything, bathroom break, )

236
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,031
(Jackstone Game, Random Game with beer, )

237
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,941
(speak casually to each other during a barbecue party, )

238
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:06,941
(bathroom break, say farewells)

239
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:09,311
We will begin by staying still...

240
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:13,311
without doing anything for two hours.

241
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,181
Doesn't that mean we will continue to hear you fart?

242
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,681
No, it's a misunderstanding.

243
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,321
Opening the door, you'll hear this.

244
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,250
The phone will go like this.

245
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,090
(So Min, sing for us.)

246
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:27,730
(She becomes confused.)

247
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,230
You should dance.

248
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,100
So Min, this is the perfect time.

249
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,061
Next comes drinking beer...

250
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,630
- while we play Random Game.
- 12-year-olds watch this show.

251
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,901
(Next comes drinking beer while we play Random Game.)

252
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,771
12-year-olds watch our show.

253
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,110
We can't drink beer while we are on the show!

254
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,781
- There is non-alcoholic beer.
- You're right.

255
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:47,250
Then I want us to have a barbecue party over a campfire...

256
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:49,710
and speak casually to each other for an hour and a half.

257
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:52,281
(Have a barbecue party and speak casually to each other.)

258
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,421
Is that so?

259
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,350
It doesn't matter.

260
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:01,191
I won't go easy on anyone just because he or she is older.

261
00:10:01,191 --> 00:10:03,031
It doesn't matter.

262
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,130
Hold on.

263
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,671
- That's not how you play this game.
- What?

264
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:09,771
- I will keep living the same way.
- It's Obedience Game.

265
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:10,840
(I can't win against him.)

266
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,100
We have the most typical schedule...

267
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,541
for the retreat.

268
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:18,080
We have over 20 years of experience.

269
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,880
(Play foot volleyball game against the production crew, )

270
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,950
(sauna time and snack time, eat Korean food, take a nap, )

271
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,781
(bathroom break, One Year Anniversary Party)

272
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,356
We are the veterans when it comes to the retreat.

273
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,220
In Daeseong-ri...

274
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,926
We are the legends when it comes to retreats.

275
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,391
Why does the most typical retreat include going to a sauna?

276
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,191
(Why does the most typical retreat include going to a sauna?)

277
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:34,360
What?

278
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,661
You said it's the most typical schedule.

279
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,600
- Don't you know?
- What?

280
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,330
- Don't you know?
- When you go to a retreat...

281
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,470
Why do you say...

282
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:45,700
(Let's high five for the retreat.)

283
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,011
He hit me!

284
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,941
- I didn't do that.
- Did you film it?

285
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,941
Did anyone see me hit him?

286
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,610
That was the slate.

287
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,041
- He hit me!
- What are you talking about?

288
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,181
Let's go again. In 1, 2, 3.

289
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:56,781
- What are you talking about?
- That was the slate.

290
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,950
You're hearing things since you've been shooting until late.

291
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm not hearing anything. I felt a slap on my cheek.

292
00:11:02,691 --> 00:11:05,120
It's a tactile hallucination.

293
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:06,531
Does that even exist?

294
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:08,061
- Yes, it does.
- I see.

295
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,700
What's the point of going to the sauna here?

296
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,761
We can go to the sauna near home.

297
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:14,531
By your logic,

298
00:11:14,531 --> 00:11:16,431
we should have stayed home instead of coming here.

299
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:20,511
Why don't you come at me as you did to Kwang Soo?

300
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,771
That's right. Why are you being so careful?

301
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,610
- Bring the board.
- What are you doing?

302
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,281
Bring the board.

303
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,950
- My goodness.
- Hurry up.

304
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,480
I can't believe him.

305
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,320
Let Jong Kook have that tactile hallucination.

306
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,891
Do you want me to make you tired?

307
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,761
(Slapping)

308
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:38,521
(He slapped his hand.)

309
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,191
Hold on.

310
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:42,111
- My goodness.
- That's not how you do it.

311
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:43,261
This is how you do it.

312
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:46,100
(This is how you do it.)

313
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,931
(You are bound to see children fight on a trip.)

314
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:51,600
(It's fun to watch them fight.)

315
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,580
(Is Jae Seok a veteran of retreats or a swindler?)

316
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
We kept the schedule simple.

317
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,641
The first thing...

318
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:01,411
(Ji Hyo, Jong Kook, and Kwang Soo's schedule)

319
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:03,151
(Hiking, fishing and lunch, rest and bathroom break, )

320
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:05,157
(Eat beef for dinner, game of yut, foot volleyball)

321
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,551
The first thing on our schedule is hiking.

322
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,321
- It's spring.
- That's a good idea.

323
00:12:09,321 --> 00:12:10,921
The weather is nice,

324
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,531
so we will gather wild herbs.

325
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,700
- So...
- It sounds like a hassle.

326
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,531
Can we focus on hiking?

327
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,271
We don't know much about edible herbs.

328
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:24,370
We don't know which ones are edible or poisonous.

329
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,340
- All right. I will cross it out.
- Okay.

330
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,441
Let's just hike.

331
00:12:27,441 --> 00:12:30,681
Why don't you take out a dot?

332
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:32,340
- A dot?
- Yes.

333
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,550
- Do you mean my mole?
- From the word "hike".

334
00:12:35,311 --> 00:12:36,350
Then it becomes "fool".

335
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,220
(Then it becomes "fool".)

336
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,021
(Bingo)

337
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,350
Did I do it right?

338
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,391
Is it what I think it is?

339
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:46,531
- Yes, it is.
- Take out a dot elsewhere.

340
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:48,391
- Did I do it wrong?
- Take out a dot elsewhere.

341
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,401
There is no other character I can take it out of.

342
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:52,360
"Fool"...

343
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,301
- is the only possible answer.
- Come on.

344
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:57,000
You did it wrong.

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,641
- Then it becomes "copy".
- That's it.

346
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,041
- Each team presented the schedule.
- Yes.

347
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,080
Please bring in the schedule.

348
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,210
(Is there another schedule?)

349
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,350
Is there another schedule?

350
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:09,511
- What?
- Aren't these the schedules?

351
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:11,226
Maybe we can't do the things that are on our schedules.

352
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,757
- What is going on?
- What is going on?

353
00:13:12,781 --> 00:13:14,651
What's Misty Time?

354
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,791
- What are those balls?
- We are drawing lots.

355
00:13:21,031 --> 00:13:24,230
It looks like we will pick numbers.

356
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,030
(The balls have the colors of the schedules.)

357
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,470
(The schedule is decided by drawing lots.)

358
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,700
We will tell you about the real race of the day.

359
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,771
The Running 365 Retreat...

360
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,710
involves an uncertain future...

361
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,641
in the form of 365 minutes of Misty Time.

362
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,911
What's Misty Time?

363
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:44,350
The retreat will follow the schedules you wrote down.

364
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,250
However, the order won't follow your schedules.

365
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,421
We will choose a schedule at random...

366
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,261
We will choose a schedule at random...

367
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,021
and follow the order it was chosen.

368
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,130
We will follow the time slots on the production crew's schedule.

369
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:00,200
(They follow the time slots on the production crew's schedule.)

370
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,801
What a bully!

371
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,700
Why did they tell us to decide on a schedule?

372
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,771
If we have 30 minutes for lunch, the time slot will end...

373
00:14:06,771 --> 00:14:07,970
on our way to the restaurant.

374
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,681
What if we get an hour and a half of bathroom break?

375
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,740
What is this?

376
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:15,250
If a member deviates from the schedule,

377
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,720
he or she will receive a penalty and a penalty badge.

378
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,090
Is there a penalty?

379
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,350
After the retreat, the member with the most penalty badges...

380
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,620
receives the final penalty.

381
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,321
He or she will pick another member.

382
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:28,391
They will give autographs to 365 fans before they go home.

383
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,531
(The penalty is giving autographs to 365 fans before going home.)

384
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:33,671
- 365 fans?
- Yes.

385
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:37,541
Now, it's time to pick the first schedule of the retreat.

386
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,941
Who wants to pick?

387
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:41,041
- You should pick, So Min.
- Okay.

388
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,171
- Please do a good job.
- You can count on me.

389
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,281
Pick, So Min.

390
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:50,220
(With 4 schedules and 6 time slots, )

391
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,321
(there are 24 options available.)

392
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,120
(Which combination of color and number comes first?)

393
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,291
Please.

394
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,061
(Which combination of color and number comes first?)

395
00:15:01,061 --> 00:15:02,960
Pick the one next to it.

396
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,100
The one next to it?

397
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,820
- The one next to it?
- The one next to it.

398
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,411
- The one next to it.
- Did you pick?

399
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,301
- What's the number?
- It's yellow.

400
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:10,401
(It's a yellow ball.)

401
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,641
It's yellow.

402
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,970
(They must do one of these things for an hour.)

403
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:18,210
- It's yellow.
- Five.

404
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,511
(5 on the yellow schedule)

405
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:20,580
Yellow, five.

406
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,980
- That's my schedule.
- Restroom break.

407
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,720
(It's a restroom break.)

408
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,440
- That's my schedule.
- Restroom break.

409
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,620
We don't need an hour to use the restroom.

410
00:15:28,691 --> 00:15:29,971
What will we do in the restroom?

411
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:31,191
Five on my schedule.

412
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,330
You will now change into the team uniform...

413
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,661
and take a restroom break.

414
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:39,100
How can we stay in the bathroom for an hour?

415
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,230
Let us pick...

416
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,401
- once more.
- Let's get started.

417
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,240
- Start with foot volleyball.
- Come to the front.

418
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,641
- Where's the bathroom?
- We'll start the timer.

419
00:15:45,641 --> 00:15:47,340
Can eight people fit inside the bathroom?

420
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,970
(Fun 365 Retreat starts.)

421
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,681
(Welcome to the bathroom where we'll shoot for an hour.)

422
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,051
(60-Minute Bathroom)

423
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,311
- What?
- What is it?

424
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,821
It's time to start.

425
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,891
There are many things. Does it have to be the bathroom?

426
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:02,691
There's a lot on the set.

427
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,990
- There's a karaoke machine.
- It's a karaoke machine.

428
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,090
(This is amazing.)

429
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,661
We could even cook here.

430
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:10,000
This is amazing.

431
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,161
(There are spacious rooms.)

432
00:16:11,161 --> 00:16:13,901
- Why did So Min pick that?
- What will we do in the bathroom?

433
00:16:13,901 --> 00:16:15,071
- I'm sorry.
- What will we do for an hour?

434
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:16,500
How will we fit in here?

435
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,801
Seriously.

436
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,840
This is nonsense.

437
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,071
(The first activity seems impossible.)

438
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,580
It's too small.

439
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,941
What will we do in the bathroom?

440
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,210
Do we have to stay in there?

441
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,480
Go into the bathroom.

442
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,151
You'll do something inside for 60 minutes.

443
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:32,480
Do what?

444
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,791
Cameras are set up, so we can't use it.

445
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:37,021
If you need to go to the bathroom, there's another one next to it.

446
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:38,291
Is this it?

447
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,360
Are there cameras inside?

448
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,730
There are no cameras.

449
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,561
Let's say you want to do something.

450
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,600
If you come out to buy a drink,

451
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:47,531
- you'll be penalized?
- What's the penalty?

452
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,007
- Is there a penalty?
- You'll find out...

453
00:16:49,031 --> 00:16:50,500
what it is once you come out.

454
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:51,970
- Goodness.
- That means...

455
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,071
- Kwang Soo should try it.
- Kwang Soo will try it.

456
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:54,610
Those who are reckless should go out.

457
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,681
- You'll be curious.
- I'm curious.

458
00:16:56,681 --> 00:16:58,311
- Goodness.
- The reckless should try it.

459
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,911
I shouldn't be curious, but I can't help it.

460
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:01,281
Let's kick Kwang Soo out.

461
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,580
(Let's kick Kwang Soo out.)

462
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,880
Shouldn't you say that secretly?

463
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,190
You said it so loudly.

464
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,420
He talks as if he's in a sitcom.

465
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,890
I couldn't help but pretend not to hear him.

466
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,890
What's wrong with you?

467
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,961
"Let's kick Kwang Soo out, okay?"

468
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,001
(Kwang Soo looks around.)

469
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,471
Shall we get started?

470
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,071
(He fakes a laugh.)

471
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:26,140
We couldn't install a camera inside.

472
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,410
Please put a camera on your chest.

473
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,640
(They each film themselves with a camera.)

474
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
- Does everyone wear it?
- Yes.

475
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,110
- Could you help me?
- You seem so excited.

476
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,910
It doesn't work well.

477
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,180
Let it go. Hold it tightly, Kwang Soo.

478
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,481
(Screaming)

479
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,721
Hold it tightly.

480
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:40,821
(His private part is attacked.)

481
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:45,120
(What just happened?)

482
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,291
- What did you do?
- Hold it tightly.

483
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:50,231
- I couldn't hold it tightly.
- I didn't mean to do that.

484
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,461
- He isn't even married yet.
- I meant...

485
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:54,731
the top. It's okay if you push against me.

486
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:56,471
Keep yourself up.

487
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:57,870
- Wait.
- I wouldn't do that.

488
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,271
I'm not an amateur.

489
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,870
You didn't do that before.

490
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,580
I'm sorry. I'll forget what happened.

491
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,680
- Okay.
- What?

492
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,910
- I'll forget what happened.
- Let it go, Jae Seok.

493
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,051
Move on.

494
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:10,680
- You should stop too.
- All right.

495
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,850
You shouldn't do that at a shoot.

496
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,190
- I came for a shoot.
- Stop it.

497
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,590
- Let's enjoy the shoot.
- Go inside.

498
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,920
- Come on, go in.
- Wait.

499
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,360
- Get out.
- Go in.

500
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,731
- Why?
- It's my spot.

501
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,061
- There's no designated spot.
- It's my spot.

502
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,130
(Everyone complains.)

503
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:26,731
- Stop it.
- I don't want water falling.

504
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,731
I hate that.

505
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,001
Is the cameraman on vacation today?

506
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,670
- What's this?
- What are we doing here?

507
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,011
Why did you choose the bathroom?

508
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:35,541
- This is terrible.
- Seriously.

509
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,140
Why did you pick it?

510
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,511
I don't know.

511
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,281
The timer has started. For the next 60 minutes,

512
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,221
stay in the bathroom.

513
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,850
Do we get penalized if we go out?

514
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,751
Yes. You'll go back inside after getting penalized.

515
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,521
Kick him out.

516
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:51,021
(Go out.)

517
00:18:51,961 --> 00:18:53,660
(Jae Seok gets a penalty after 10 seconds.)

518
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,890
- Okay.
- Go out.

519
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,301
- Jae Seok will be penalized.
- No way.

520
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,830
Go outside.

521
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,571
- Jae Seok will be penalized.
- Why?

522
00:19:01,571 --> 00:19:03,130
- Why me?
- You're out.

523
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,241
Why would I be penalized?

524
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,100
- Seriously.
- Get your penalty.

525
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,140
There he goes.

526
00:19:08,241 --> 00:19:10,410
(He gets dragged.)

527
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,580
- Tell me what it is.
- Hold on.

528
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,650
Haha.

529
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,080
- This is quite fun.
- It is.

530
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,051
- He went outside.
- This is fun.

531
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,781
- It's interesting.
- Will he come back?

532
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:20,791
- Will he come back?
- Yes.

533
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,090
- Kick him out when he returns.
- That's right.

534
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,561
Isn't that harsh?

535
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:28,061
(Surprised, is this the penalty?)

536
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:31,231
My goodness.

537
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,231
Look at him.

538
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:35,370
That's the penalty.

539
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,971
- This is it.
- Goodness.

540
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:38,771
We should never go outside.

541
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,541
- Gosh.
- It's simple but funny.

542
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,140
- We should never leave.
- It's simple but funny.

543
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,241
How about...

544
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,140
we play Musical Chairs?

545
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,781
- In here?
- We must do something.

546
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,481
- In here?
- We can't stay still.

547
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:51,150
- We need chairs.
- We have to look forward.

548
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,481
We must look outside the door.

549
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,631
- We don't know what we'll do.
- When you turn,

550
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,291
don't turn inwards.

551
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,221
We must turn this way, okay?

552
00:19:58,221 --> 00:19:59,620
- Okay.
- Please stand up.

553
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,660
- We're playing Musical Chairs.
- With these?

554
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,690
Take out a chair.

555
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:03,900
- We don't need all of them.
- Can we even turn?

556
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,400
We have to turn no matter what.

557
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:07,630
In 1, 2, 3.

558
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,731
- Round and round - Start moving.

559
00:20:09,731 --> 00:20:15,211
- Dance while turning around - Dance while turning around

560
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,940
- Go fast.
- While clapping

561
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:19,011
- And singing - And singing

562
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:21,380
- Keep going.
- Let's dance

563
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,011
- Have fun - Turn the other way.

564
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,321
Turn the other way.

565
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:28,521
The whistle should blow from the outside.

566
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,991
Please blow the whistle.

567
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:31,620
(The whistle blows.)

568
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:35,291
(They start struggling as the whistle blows.)

569
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,330
(The members inside sit down successfully.)

570
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,400
There we go.

571
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,471
(Who will be eliminated?)

572
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay, that's good.

573
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,410
(Kwang Soo fails to sit down.)

574
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,541
No.

575
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,811
(Go outside, Ji Hyo.)

576
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,551
- She already sat down.
- She sat down.

577
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:55,051
- She sat down.
- I sat down.

578
00:20:55,051 --> 00:20:57,781
(They end up fighting anyway.)

579
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:59,080
- Go outside.
- It's over.

580
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,650
- Is it over?
- Yes.

581
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,890
Do I have to go?

582
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,920
- Goodbye.
- Go outside. It's over.

583
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,961
(And so, the passionate tango started.)

584
00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,430
- Goodness.
- Push him.

585
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,660
Push him out.

586
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,301
(The audience claps.)

587
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,640
Push him out.

588
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:18,571
Hey, Kwang Soo.

589
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,271
You were eliminated.

590
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:21,311
Lift Kwang Soo's feet.

591
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,380
I don't want to.

592
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,781
- What is this?
- Be careful.

593
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,821
(What? Is it Jae Seok?)

594
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,021
Goodness.

595
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,751
(While pushing out Kwang Soo, )

596
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,791
(Jae Seok pushes himself out.)

597
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,521
- He went outside.
- One of them went out.

598
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,860
He went out. We're safe.

599
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,090
Come on.

600
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:44,830
Hey.

601
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,100
Kwang Soo, you lost.

602
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,600
I lost this game.

603
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,301
I lost Musical Chairs, but you lost this game.

604
00:21:50,301 --> 00:21:51,501
(He gets dragged out again.)

605
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:52,971
Wait a minute.

606
00:21:53,071 --> 00:21:54,670
- Hey.
- That worked.

607
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,271
- It's exhausting.
- That was funny.

608
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:59,281
Why don't we play Musical Chairs outside where it's spacious?

609
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,211
- Ji Hyo.
- I'm tired.

610
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:03,680
I'm also tired.

611
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,720
- I have dark circles.
- This isn't an anniversary.

612
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,221
He's coming back.

613
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,291
- He got makeup.
- Is it?

614
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,521
- He looks cute.
- Jae Seok.

615
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,920
Hey.

616
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,330
- Why didn't you go out?
- I'm sorry.

617
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,690
What's the white thing?

618
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,031
Why didn't you go out?

619
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,001
The makeup is done carelessly.

620
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,731
- Let me see.
- The person isn't professional.

621
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:24,541
- It's done carelessly.
- He does it carelessly.

622
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,640
- What's on your face?
- It isn't makeup.

623
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,211
He should do it carefully,

624
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,910
but he put it on his thumb.

625
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:31,610
The penalty isn't the problem. You just look bad.

626
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,711
Who pushed me from behind?

627
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,680
- I didn't.
- I was sitting down.

628
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,120
- It was So Min.
- I just saw that...

629
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,390
you were doing a handstand.

630
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:41,821
You were already doing a handstand.

631
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:43,991
- So Min pushed you.
- Seok Jin was behind me.

632
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:45,420
- I didn't do it.
- Was it you?

633
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,031
- Did I do it?
- Was it Seok Jin?

634
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,031
No way.

635
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:50,961
- All right.
- Let's play the folding game.

636
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,630
- Okay, let's do that.
- The folding game.

637
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,930
The folding game.

638
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,400
- The loser goes out.
- He has to go out.

639
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,940
- You start, Jae Seok.
- Shall I?

640
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,380
Put down a finger if you're the oldest.

641
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,440
Okay.

642
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,781
- It can't be helped.
- It's just a game.

643
00:23:06,781 --> 00:23:08,251
- Okay.
- I got it.

644
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,781
- I got it.
- It can't be helped.

645
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,427
Put down a finger if you're wearing glasses.

646
00:23:12,451 --> 00:23:13,821
You never know with this one.

647
00:23:13,821 --> 00:23:15,051
(Jae Seok takes off his glasses.)

648
00:23:15,051 --> 00:23:16,890
- You can't take them off anymore.
- You can't.

649
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,660
- Really?
- From now on?

650
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,261
- Starting now.
- Before I take them off?

651
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:21,590
I took them off before.

652
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,461
It's my turn.

653
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,201
Seok Jin, put down a finger.

654
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,731
This is how you play.

655
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,430
- Can you call someone's name?
- It's allowed.

656
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,870
- Can you call someone's name?
- Yes, you can.

657
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,900
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

658
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,071
(So Min is up next.)

659
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,811
Play it.

660
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,916
Put down a finger if you spray your hair black.

661
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,281
"Put down a finger if you spray your hair black."

662
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,350
(Seok Jin laughs.)

663
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,180
- Did you?
- Can you prove it?

664
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,880
- He's honest.
- Can you prove it?

665
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,021
- What if we wipe it off?
- It's over.

666
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:48,350
- We got it.
- There it is.

667
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,390
(We see proof.)

668
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,660
Show it to him.

669
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,690
- We got it.
- Look.

670
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,501
- We got it.
- We did, didn't we?

671
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:58,031
- Okay.
- He has one finger left.

672
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,701
You have one left.

673
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,471
Put down a finger if you have one finger left.

674
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:02,471
(Put down a finger if you have one finger left.)

675
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:03,840
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

676
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,940
- Go out.
- Go.

677
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,711
- Goodbye.
- Stop it.

678
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:09,311
I'm not coming with you.

679
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:11,011
You should go.

680
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:12,340
Get out.

681
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,410
(He gets dragged.)

682
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,610
- Go out.
- Goodbye.

683
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,781
See you.

684
00:24:15,781 --> 00:24:17,451
(Seok Jin screams.)

685
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,021
(He falls on the floor.)

686
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,751
(He gets penalized.)

687
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:23,190
You were going to leave anyway.

688
00:24:23,291 --> 00:24:24,721
You wait and see.

689
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,660
- We work well as a team.
- That was great.

690
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,531
We have to stay here all day long.

691
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,630
(When will this be over?)

692
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,100
How many minutes passed so far?

693
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,801
20 minutes have passed.

694
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,640
How many more games do we have to play?

695
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,311
It's fun to be sitting here like this.

696
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,311
Goodness.

697
00:24:41,971 --> 00:24:44,110
(Seok Jin comes back.)

698
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:45,781
He's not wearing makeup.

699
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,011
- How is the makeup artist?
- He looks cute.

700
00:24:48,011 --> 00:24:49,380
How is the makeup artist?

701
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,880
He's in a yellow uniform.

702
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,551
Go outside if you're curious.

703
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,221
Kwang Soo looks so calm.

704
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:58,321
Let's play another game.

705
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,930
Staying in the bathroom...

706
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,501
for an hour is too harsh.

707
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,761
- Can it be 30 minutes?
- Can you give us jelly?

708
00:25:06,061 --> 00:25:08,630
If we don't pick a game for food, we won't eat.

709
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,340
- We won't eat.
- You're right.

710
00:25:10,471 --> 00:25:13,511
Can we use the bathroom?

711
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,886
- It's next door.
- It's next door.

712
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,311
- Can we go there?
- Aren't you penalized if you do?

713
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:18,981
You're allowed to use the bathroom.

714
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:20,350
- It's a fake bathroom.
- You can go.

715
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,781
- Can I go?
- Of course.

716
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,110
You can use the bathroom next door.

717
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,751
- Is it really...
- Kwang Soo.

718
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:26,521
Do you want to use it here?

719
00:25:27,751 --> 00:25:28,791
He stepped on it.

720
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,021
- You can't step on the floor.
- Okay.

721
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,791
I was going to the bathroom.

722
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,360
(He got caught.)

723
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,400
- I knew this would happen.
- You said I could.

724
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:38,561
Okay.

725
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:39,870
- You said I could use the bathroom.
- You can't step on the floor.

726
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,630
- Okay.
- You said I could use the bathroom.

727
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,670
- You should have used the wall.
- You can't step on the floor.

728
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,400
- I mean...
- You can't step on the floor.

729
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,870
Isn't that common sense?

730
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,011
- It is.
- It's common sense.

731
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:50,241
How could he not know that?

732
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,981
You said I could use the bathroom.

733
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,410
Dong Geun, it's you.

734
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,580
(Chief referee)

735
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,580
Dong Geun.

736
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,880
Dong Geun.

737
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,090
Dong Geun, we're friends, right?

738
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:02,291
Dong Geun.

739
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,890
- Should we play kungkungdda?
- I wish I had a toothbrush.

740
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,491
Kungkungdda is boring.

741
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,590
What about 369?

742
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,801
- Kungkungdda...
- 369, 369

743
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:12,961
Playing 369 here would be the worst.

744
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,370
What are we supposed to do then?

745
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,100
Look at Kwang Soo.

746
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,940
- You look great.
- You look cute.

747
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,600
- You look cute.
- It looks nice.

748
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,910
- It says, "poop".
- That's so boring.

749
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,916
It must have been done by someone with little experience.

750
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,781
You're not supposed to write letters.

751
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,110
Writing letters makes it boring.

752
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,350
How could he write "poop" on a person's face?

753
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,620
- This should go to the back?
- There's 30 minutes left.

754
00:26:33,021 --> 00:26:34,491
Time is going by so slowly.

755
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,561
Guys, are you hungry?

756
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,690
- Yes!
- Yes!

757
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,890
One person can go out for 10 minutes.

758
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,991
You'll play a game loved by college students.

759
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,761
- Sounds good.
- Sure.

760
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,731
- We'll demonstrate.
- We needed this.

761
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:49,100
We were talking about 369 and kungkungdda.

762
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,640
It's called "Maggots in a Honey Bucket".

763
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,940
They play such a game?

764
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,610
- Let us demonstrate.
- Okay.

765
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,211
There's such a game?

766
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,741
- Maggots in a Honey Bucket?
- Yes.

767
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,051
I think I've heard of it.

768
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,180
Ready, start.

769
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,321
- Maggots in a honey bucket - Maggots in a honey bucket

770
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:07,920
- Mag - Gots

771
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,190
- Maggots - In

772
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,620
- A - In a

773
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,920
- Hon - Ey

774
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,360
- Honey - Buck

775
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,791
- Et - Bucket

776
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,991
- Maggots in a honey bucket - Maggots in a honey bucket

777
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:19,201
(What...)

778
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:21,100
(is that?)

779
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,541
- What's that?
- Can you pretend to be excited?

780
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,041
What's that?

781
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,610
What are they doing?

782
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,471
College students play this?

783
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:32,080
- It's so boring.
- When did you leave college?

784
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,751
- They really play this boring game?
- Are you sure?

785
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:38,451
Even Seok Jin doesn't know.

786
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,721
How old are the ones who play this game?

787
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:43,390
I don't know how old they are,

788
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,821
but if you lose, you'll have to go out.

789
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,491
Well... Who wants to start?

790
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:49,090
I want to start. Let's start.

791
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:51,860
- Maggots in a honey bucket - Maggots in a honey bucket

792
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,100
- Mag - Gots

793
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,471
- Maggots - In

794
00:27:54,471 --> 00:27:55,771
- A - In a

795
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:57,001
- Hon - Ey

796
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,301
- Honey - Buck

797
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,571
- Et - Bucket

798
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,840
- No.
- It's wrong.

799
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,880
(They're supposed to say, "Maggots in a honey bucket, ha".)

800
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,580
Hold on. We were just practicing.

801
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,650
Go out.

802
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,380
Come on.

803
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,981
(Maggot Seok Jin is released.)

804
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,021
With Seok Jin out, it'll be different.

805
00:28:15,021 --> 00:28:16,991
- All right.
- Let's try. Start.

806
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:19,660
- Maggots in a honey bucket - Maggots in a honey bucket

807
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,860
- Mag - Gots

808
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,130
- Maggots - In

809
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,400
- A - In a

810
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,701
- Hon - Ey

811
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:25,900
- Honey - Buck

812
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,201
- Et - Bucket

813
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:29,840
- Maggots in a honey bucket - Maggots in a honey bucket

814
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,140
(Haha is wrong.)

815
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,211
Oh, that's how you play?

816
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,711
Maggots in a honey bucket

817
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,011
(You can practice in the makeup room.)

818
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:41,011
(Annoyed)

819
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:43,880
College students these days play like this?

820
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
(1 in, 1 out)

821
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,180
It says, "stupid".

822
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,350
What's that?

823
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,420
- The game is difficult.
- It is.

824
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,491
- It's very hard.
- It is.

825
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:54,961
Can't we play another game?

826
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,930
- 007 is fun.
- Let's do something fun.

827
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,630
Ji Hyo, 007 has been around since the 1980s.

828
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,701
- I mean...
- But the silent version is fun.

829
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,900
- Silent 007.
- You have to keep silent.

830
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,100
I don't know how to play it.

831
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,511
- I know nothing.
- You've never played it?

832
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:08,571
You start like this.

833
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,110
Let me explain the rules.

834
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,041
When the fourth person is pointed at,

835
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,481
the two people sitting next to that person raise their hands.

836
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:14,987
- You can't make any noise.
- That's right.

837
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,981
- You can't even make this sound?
- No.

838
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,721
- You can't even laugh.
- You can't.

839
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:20,291
- Don't laugh.
- Don't show your teeth.

840
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,491
- Let's start from Seok Jin.
- Okay.

841
00:29:21,491 --> 00:29:23,261
- Let's go.
- Start.

842
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,090
(Zero)

843
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,461
(Zero)

844
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,791
(7)

845
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,561
(Bang! Screaming)

846
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,461
(Zero)

847
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:34,400
(0, 7)

848
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,501
(Bang! Screaming)

849
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:38,370
(The bathroom game is becoming intense.)

850
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,110
(Bang! Screaming)

851
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,571
(Zero)

852
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,870
(Zero)

853
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,211
(Seven, Bang! Screaming)

854
00:29:44,211 --> 00:29:45,481
(Flustered)

855
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:49,850
(Jong Kook makes a sound by mistake.)

856
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:52,620
(Jae Seok is supposed to raise his hands.)

857
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,850
You're out too.

858
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,120
You didn't raise your hands.

859
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,160
You said something. Come here.

860
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,420
I didn't say anything.

861
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,860
What are you talking about?

862
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:03,360
You punks!

863
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,231
You punks!

864
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,830
Losers should come out.

865
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,041
Gosh.

866
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,940
- We should take Jong Kook with us.
- Jong Kook!

867
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,271
Can I stay in here?

868
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,870
(Happy)

869
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,380
At this rate, everyone will be out.

870
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
(Happy)

871
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:22,311
(You just said something.)

872
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:26,221
Are we still doing the silent thing?

873
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:32,021
(There's suddenly so much space.)

874
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:35,690
(The cruel 007 game continues.)

875
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:37,461
(Should I start?)

876
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,400
(In addition to the cameramen, the sound director gets a break.)

877
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,301
(Time out)

878
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,511
(No way.)

879
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,481
(The game continues in a serious atmosphere.)

880
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,650
(Harlequin)

881
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,080
Gosh, they sprayed my hair.

882
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:00,551
You're still playing?

883
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:05,821
(Zero, zero, seven)

884
00:31:06,261 --> 00:31:08,291
(Ji Hyo loses.)

885
00:31:10,231 --> 00:31:12,461
(She raises her hands at the wrong moment.)

886
00:31:14,031 --> 00:31:16,001
(Why?)

887
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,870
Hey. I can't believe you guys.

888
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,410
You guys teamed up?

889
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:24,211
(You punks!)

890
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,110
Gosh, you two...

891
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,221
You two are together, aren't you? Hey!

892
00:31:30,451 --> 00:31:32,880
You can't team up.

893
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,090
(With a new member, the game continues.)

894
00:31:37,761 --> 00:31:39,690
(Are we playing 007?)

895
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,201
(Haha starts.)

896
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:45,731
(0, 0, 7)

897
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:46,870
(Bang! Screaming)

898
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,870
(So Min is late.)

899
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:51,900
(So Min is eliminated.)

900
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,311
We never teamed up!

901
00:31:56,311 --> 00:31:57,311
(She wanted to say, )

902
00:31:57,311 --> 00:31:58,311
("We didn't team up!")

903
00:31:58,311 --> 00:32:02,380
We didn't team up.

904
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,850
We didn't.

905
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:07,350
I can go out, right? I'm the winner.

906
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,791
- Can I go out?
- But I said...

907
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:11,190
you needed to succeed the original game three times.

908
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,991
I never said the winner would be going out.

909
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,830
(What have we been doing?)

910
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:17,731
I don't have any space left on my face.

911
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,571
They definitely don't have much experience.

912
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:24,041
Are there any references?

913
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,071
Hey.

914
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,311
- Jong Kook looks scary.
- Jong Kook...

915
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:30,180
He looks so evil.

916
00:32:30,211 --> 00:32:31,741
Is it Halloween today?

917
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:35,410
- He looks scary.
- Haha looked cute.

918
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,281
Guys, they're dating.

919
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,880
- What?
- I'm 100-percent sure.

920
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,590
They teamed up...

921
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,120
and tricked me.

922
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,721
- I'm not lying.
- Sit down and wait.

923
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:49,390
- I mean it.
- Take it easy.

924
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,801
I don't care if they're together.

925
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,130
Se Chan, you look good.

926
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,771
Jae Seok is drawing on his own face.

927
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:57,600
(Focused)

928
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,001
Look at him.

929
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:01,271
They're inexperienced. My scalp hurts.

930
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,481
They almost stuck the spray in his hair.

931
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,910
They sprayed my hair like this.

932
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,850
- Is it Halloween?
- I'm a robot every time.

933
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,350
- Why do you look so scary?
- They didn't make me look cute.

934
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,080
Let's play silent 007 again.

935
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,890
We need to earn the right to go out.

936
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,791
Let us play another game.

937
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,221
Not maggots in a honey bucket.

938
00:33:17,221 --> 00:33:18,791
It was too difficult.

939
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,090
When everyone comes back,

940
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,461
let's just push each other out.

941
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,301
What are you talking about?

942
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,400
What did you say?

943
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,100
The one who is left in here will win.

944
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,600
- All right. Let's do it.
- You're selfish.

945
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,771
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

946
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,801
Let's do it.

947
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,041
(The girls are back?)

948
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,041
They're back.

949
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,571
- You're selfish.
- Let's do it.

950
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:36,610
Let's do it.

951
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,311
(The fart girl appears.)

952
00:33:39,511 --> 00:33:40,511
(She is officially the fart girl.)

953
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,080
It says, "fart".

954
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,350
(The fart girl is here.)

955
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,221
- The fart girl.
- I love it.

956
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,021
Fart girl.

957
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:50,390
- Ji Hyo.
- Ma'am.

958
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,021
Are you on "Show Me the Money"?

959
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:53,690
- Ji Hyo looks cute.
- Look at her.

960
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,690
- Gosh.
- You look okay.

961
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,561
- Seriously...
- We've all been out.

962
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,201
We've all been out.

963
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:00,841
- That's what always happens.
- Everyone.

964
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,801
What's important is the number of penalty badges.

965
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,910
- Right.
- Jae Seok has three penalty badges.

966
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,971
- 3?
- 3.

967
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,581
- Seok Jin also has three.
- That's a lot.

968
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:13,411
The rest of you have one each.

969
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:15,310
I can't believe it.

970
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:17,721
Why was I out?

971
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,590
- Okay.
- Let's go out.

972
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,920
- It's over.
- It's over.

973
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,891
- Gosh.
- It was too much.

974
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:26,090
Finally.

975
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,931
Let's decide on the next activity.

976
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:29,190
Let's do it right this time.

977
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,201
We spent an hour in the bathroom.

978
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:32,900
What if it's the bathroom again?

979
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,031
We were in there for an hour.

980
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,571
Can we do the same thing again?

981
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:36,801
Of course.

982
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:38,976
- It's been an hour.
- Don't pick it again.

983
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,720
We shouldn't go back to the bathroom again.

984
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:42,411
But so many people wrote it.

985
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,840
It's not okay.

986
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,551
I hope we'll eat this time.

987
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,110
Let's eat some meat. I'm hungry.

988
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,420
- I want meat too.
- It's 30 minutes this time.

989
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,020
Let's decide on the next activity.

990
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,790
- Se Chan, try it.
- Se Chan should pick.

991
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,721
- Se Chan.
- It's his anniversary.

992
00:34:57,991 --> 00:34:59,891
Yes. Those two should pick.

993
00:35:00,161 --> 00:35:01,860
Be brave and pick.

994
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,661
It's only 30 minutes. Pick the right one.

995
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:08,101
(If they can't finish the activity, they'll receive penalty badges.)

996
00:35:09,101 --> 00:35:10,400
- This one.
- Okay.

997
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,641
(What did he pick?)

998
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:13,310
- Let's eat.
- We have 30 minutes.

999
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,511
- It's a green ball.
- Let's eat.

1000
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:16,011
(Green)

1001
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:18,840
(Number 2)

1002
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:22,911
- Green, two.
- Green.

1003
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,250
Pork belly party. Yes!

1004
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,121
(Jong Kook will grill pork belly for the members.)

1005
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,250
- Jong Kook will grill the meat.
- I knew it.

1006
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,621
- Guys!
- Great.

1007
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:31,991
- Okay.
- We have only 30 minutes.

1008
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:34,690
- We have 30 minutes.
- The timer will be on.

1009
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,130
- We don't have much time.
- Right now, we...

1010
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,661
Time will be up once we finish grilling.

1011
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:39,900
- We don't have pork belly here.
- What?

1012
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,400
Come on.

1013
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,670
- You should've bought it.
- A team will go to the supermarket.

1014
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,000
- The rest will prepare the meal.
- Are you serious?

1015
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,480
- Listen.
- What do you want from us?

1016
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,110
- Hey.
- That's not fair.

1017
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,241
Are you serious right now?

1018
00:35:49,241 --> 00:35:51,710
We didn't think that you would have a barbecue.

1019
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,141
The grocery store is a minute away by car.

1020
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:54,987
- It might work. We'll have time.
- That's great.

1021
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:56,980
Hold on. Everyone, calm down.

1022
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,027
Let's split into teams. A team will go grocery shopping.

1023
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:00,190
Another will start the fire.

1024
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,351
- You two should go.
- The two of us?

1025
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,590
- We'll be back.
- Run!

1026
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:03,896
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan will go grocery shopping.)

1027
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,090
- We're going like this?
- Yes, let's just hurry.

1028
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:08,391
Let's get it. Hey, hurry.

1029
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:10,400
Ji Hyo, it's a minute away. We have time.

1030
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,876
(Eating pork belly grilled by Jong Kook for 30 minutes begins.)

1031
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,971
Hurry, Ji Hyo.

1032
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:18,071
(They can accomplish the mission only when no one messes up.)

1033
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:19,911
First of all, when we get there,

1034
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,141
- let's get thin pork belly...
- Thin pork belly.

1035
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:22,971
And vegetables for wraps.

1036
00:36:23,411 --> 00:36:24,911
- And ssamjang.
- Ssamjang.

1037
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:27,110
- We should get sausages too.
- Of course.

1038
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,581
We should get some food for ourselves too.

1039
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,520
We should get some food for ourselves too.

1040
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,721
Right. Even if the others came, they would've...

1041
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,991
- Exactly.
- Done that too.

1042
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,860
- If Kwang Soo and So Min came, - My gosh.

1043
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,161
- We wouldn't have a chance.
- They would pretend to be running.

1044
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:40,931
- Exactly.
- They would've done that for sure.

1045
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,360
- Absolutely. That's for sure.
- Right.

1046
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,101
Even if we come back quickly, the fire wouldn't have been ready.

1047
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,931
- It takes time.
- It takes a long time to do that.

1048
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,270
We should start the grill as quickly as we can.

1049
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,641
(What do you mean? It blazes up straight away.)

1050
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,270
(Oh, my gosh!)

1051
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,681
- My gosh.
- What if this explodes?

1052
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,011
Hey, hey, hey.

1053
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,250
(With the torch, they have a camp fire too.)

1054
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,451
Hey, this is a good torch.

1055
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:03,351
- It makes strong flames. Hold on.
- That's good.

1056
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:05,081
- Why do you get so scared easily?
- The gloves.

1057
00:37:05,081 --> 00:37:06,551
- My gosh.
- That's a flame thrower.

1058
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:10,121
- Is that enough?
- It looks like the underworld.

1059
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:11,960
(I will burn everything up.)

1060
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,590
All right. Take a look. It's working.

1061
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,831
My gosh.

1062
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,301
We can eat as soon as they come back with the meat.

1063
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,270
They should've been here already. What's taking them so long?

1064
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,971
- They're taking too long.
- I had a bad feeling about this.

1065
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:23,770
- My gosh.
- They are so slow.

1066
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,371
Are they eating at the market?

1067
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,940
- Where are you?
- We're on our way.

1068
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:30,141
- Rush back.
- Hurry back. We don't have time.

1069
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:31,281
- We're on our back way.
- You ate there,

1070
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,781
- didn't you?
- You didn't eat there, right?

1071
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,011
Why is your voice echoing?

1072
00:37:34,011 --> 00:37:35,951
- Did you get ramyeon?
- Why is it echoing in the car?

1073
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:37,396
Something is fishy. He sounds like he's in the restroom.

1074
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,621
Why is your voice echoing?

1075
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:39,821
Hello? Hello?

1076
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:41,750
- Something is going on.
- Something is up.

1077
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,661
- Do they think I'm an idiot?
- No.

1078
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
They are not in the car.

1079
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,230
(Betrayal tastes sweet.)

1080
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,701
- Do you think the grill is ready?
- Yes.

1081
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:55,000
(We get that we don't have time, but we must feed ourselves first.)

1082
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,670
Ji Hyo, should we just...

1083
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,641
have a bowl of ox bone soup? Should we just do it?

1084
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:02,340
- How many minutes do we have?
- You have about 15 minutes.

1085
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,940
- No.
- 15 minutes? My gosh.

1086
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,710
They should've come back a long time ago.

1087
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,011
They need to be here by now.

1088
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:08,951
- Did they run off?
- Did they run off?

1089
00:38:08,951 --> 00:38:10,250
Call Ji Hyo.

1090
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:13,190
If we don't get to eat the meat after starting the grill,

1091
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,051
- I would be so angry.
- Jae Seok.

1092
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,821
Ji Hyo pressed the wrong button.

1093
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,570
- What did she say?
- Thank you.

1094
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,000
- They just bought the food.
- They just bought it.

1095
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,831
- This is over.
- They just bought it.

1096
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:25,000
I think they ate whatever they wanted to eat there.

1097
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,770
Hurry, hurry. Come on, hurry.

1098
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:29,400
- Run. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1099
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,201
- They're just leaving the store.
- Why did they waste their time?

1100
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,110
- The instant rice.
- Right.

1101
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,940
(They are ringing up the food now.)

1102
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,210
(Wait. Hold on.)

1103
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,281
(What's going on?)

1104
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,821
- I need to ring them up again.
- Why?

1105
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,650
(He has to scan the barcodes again.)

1106
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,150
- I need to ring them up again.
- Why?

1107
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,991
Because of the previous customer,

1108
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,460
the ones I scanned earlier got deleted.

1109
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,331
- Hurry, hurry. Are you serious?
- No.

1110
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:57,661
- Then please hurry.
- I'll cancel...

1111
00:38:57,661 --> 00:38:59,421
- everything and ring them up again.
- Okay.

1112
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,900
- This is insane.
- My gosh.

1113
00:39:02,331 --> 00:39:03,871
(They face a crisis at the end.)

1114
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:06,301
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't be.

1115
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,911
- No, that's all right.
- It's over.

1116
00:39:09,471 --> 00:39:12,241
We wasted 2 or 3 minutes because we had to ring them up again.

1117
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:15,411
It's over. We failed.

1118
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:17,920
How many minutes do we have?

1119
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,420
- About 8 minutes?
- You have 8 minutes.

1120
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,491
- You have 8 minutes.
- 8 minutes?

1121
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,571
- It's over. It's done.
- We can't even eat ramyeon.

1122
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,960
We should grill Se Chan's hands.

1123
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:27,391
(We just need to grill something to succeed.)

1124
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:28,661
- On the grill?
- Yes.

1125
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,400
I'll grill his hands.

1126
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,200
(We just need to grill something to succeed.)

1127
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,931
(The blazing grill is empty. Will they fail to complete the mission?)

1128
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:39,201
(They arrive with the meat with 5 minutes left.)

1129
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:40,270
- Where are you?
- Where are you?

1130
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,340
- Hey!
- Is that you?

1131
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,141
- What did you eat?
- We didn't eat anything.

1132
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:44,710
- Grill the sausages.
- My gosh.

1133
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,141
- Hey, this is the meat.
- Hurry, and grill the meat.

1134
00:39:46,141 --> 00:39:47,551
- Hey, we're running out of time.
- Here's the meat.

1135
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,980
Throw the meat on the grill!

1136
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,020
(Jong Kook has to grill the meat.)

1137
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,621
You opened the bags of ramyeon in advance. Okay.

1138
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:52,681
Jong Kook.

1139
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:54,321
You have five minutes before the time is up.

1140
00:39:54,321 --> 00:39:55,451
- Hey!
- You guys!

1141
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:57,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Do we have gochujang?

1142
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,560
- Hey, hey.
- Is the rice ready?

1143
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:01,261
No, it's not ready yet.

1144
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,531
Forget about the rice.

1145
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:05,360
- This is the ox bone soup.
- I put it in there. I already did.

1146
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,230
- You have four minutes left.
- Darn it.

1147
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:09,940
Hey, if we can't finish in time,

1148
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,500
everyone can grab one of these and eat.

1149
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:12,900
Got it?

1150
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,646
- I got it.
- Grab one each, and start eating.

1151
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,810
They're getting cooked.

1152
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,480
This is insane.

1153
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,710
They are almost done. They are almost all cooked.

1154
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,281
Three minutes before your time is up.

1155
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:23,621
My gosh! We 're almost done.

1156
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:25,020
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1157
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,051
(The undercooked meat frustrates them.)

1158
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:27,290
I think ramyeon is ready.

1159
00:40:27,351 --> 00:40:28,491
No, not yet.

1160
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,790
(Taking the noodles)

1161
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:32,560
It's not ready yet.

1162
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,301
- I like undercooked noodles.
- Wait.

1163
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:38,831
(She eats undercooked noodles as she's desperate.)

1164
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,471
- Let's eat the rice at least.
- You have two minutes.

1165
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:41,571
Let's eat the rice.

1166
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,500
Should we mix the rice with ssamjang?

1167
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,701
- The meat isn't hot at all.
- Hey, we can eat this.

1168
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:46,816
- We should eat now.
- Eat the ramyeon now.

1169
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,340
- Let's eat.
- Eat up.

1170
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,471
(They all eat ramyeon first.)

1171
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,810
How many minutes do we have left?

1172
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,340
(They all eat ramyeon first.)

1173
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,210
Hey, the noodles aren't cooked.

1174
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:56,851
- My gosh, it's all ready.
- You have one minute left.

1175
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:59,051
- One minute.
- Eat the pork belly.

1176
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:00,821
This is all cooked, right?

1177
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,020
- They're cooked. Just eat it.
- I don't know. Just eat one.

1178
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,190
- I ate one.
- Eat it.

1179
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,431
(They finish their 2nd part of the schedule.)

1180
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,491
Stop.

1181
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:12,201
(Stop!)

1182
00:41:12,201 --> 00:41:14,071
Ji Hyo, stop eating. Everyone, stop.

1183
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,407
- You'll draw for another mission.
- This doesn't qualify as a retreat.

1184
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,571
What is this?

1185
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,641
I didn't get to finish the ramyeon either.

1186
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:22,210
You will proceed to draw for another mission.

1187
00:41:22,641 --> 00:41:24,081
We can pick the same one!

1188
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,810
- We can pick the same mission.
- That's right.

1189
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,487
(This time, the mission lasts for 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1190
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:28,681
Seok Jin, you should draw.

1191
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:30,851
Seok Jin, you should draw.

1192
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:33,150
(We have set up everything for the meal.)

1193
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:36,451
(Let us enjoy our meal for 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1194
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,590
Green, six.

1195
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,031
- That's my schedule.
- Green, six.

1196
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:45,711
- It's foot volleyball.
- Foot volleyball.

1197
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,331
- Foot volleyball.
- We'll play on an empty stomach?

1198
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,500
- Foot volleyball.
- Seriously? What about the food?

1199
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,840
You can just play foot volleyball.

1200
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,617
You will play foot volleyball for an hour and a half.

1201
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,770
I don't want to. No!

1202
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,411
I don't want to play it.

1203
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:58,980
It's our retreat. Why must we?

1204
00:41:59,011 --> 00:42:01,110
- We'll starve to death then.
- Even if we do nothing...

1205
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,781
You should at least give us some food if we play.

1206
00:42:02,781 --> 00:42:04,020
How can we play that for an hour and a half?

1207
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,221
Let's try this then.

1208
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:07,690
- Split into teams, and play it.
- We can eat ramyeon.

1209
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:09,351
The winning team will have 10 minutes to go out.

1210
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,761
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1211
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,221
- Okay, okay.
- You can go out.

1212
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:13,431
- Okay.
- I like that idea.

1213
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,190
Split into 2 teams of 4 freely.

1214
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,531
(Team White: Jong Kook, Se Chan, Seok Jin, and So Min)

1215
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:20,611
(Team Black: Haha, Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo.)

1216
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,670
(Play foot volleyball for 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1217
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,241
(Which team will win a chance to go out for 10 minutes?)

1218
00:42:25,241 --> 00:42:27,110
- Let's do the cheer.
- Let's do it.

1219
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,141
- 1, 2, 3. We can do it!
- We can do it!

1220
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,340
- We can do it!
- Let's eat!

1221
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,411
Hey, we are bound to win this match.

1222
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:33,980
If we lose, we won't be able to eat.

1223
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,750
- Let's have a break.
- You bet.

1224
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:37,551
Which team will serve first?

1225
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,827
We should play a game to decide that.

1226
00:42:38,851 --> 00:42:39,920
Let's play a game to decide.

1227
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,800
- We should play a game for that.
- I'll start.

1228
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,621
- I got it.
- We'll win anyway.

1229
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:46,531
(Kwang Soo serves first.)

1230
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:47,790
There you go. My gosh.

1231
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,630
(Seok Jin and Se Chan make a play together.)

1232
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,531
- Okay!
- We got it.

1233
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:53,831
(Kicking)

1234
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:55,670
- Okay!
- Let me explain what happened.

1235
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,270
It happened because...

1236
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,241
- Okay. We didn't start yet.
- Okay.

1237
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,741
We did well. Yes!

1238
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,810
- Take your time.
- Seok Jin.

1239
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,440
We need to be careful of the ground.

1240
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,141
- We can only kick it three times?
- Yes.

1241
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:07,281
(She's new to foot volleyball.)

1242
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:08,650
- Let's go!
- We're starting now.

1243
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:09,750
I'll serve.

1244
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,081
- How many points do we need to win?
- 10 points.

1245
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,520
Seok Jin, move aside.

1246
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,891
(He's in the way.)

1247
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,891
You need to move away.

1248
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:17,161
- You can't block the serve.
- I see.

1249
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,491
The ball will hit your head then.

1250
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,661
(The game starts.)

1251
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:21,831
I see.

1252
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,301
- Hurry, hurry.
- Nice.

1253
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,500
- Wait.
- Just kick it over.

1254
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,201
- That was strong.
- Nice!

1255
00:43:28,571 --> 00:43:31,040
(Jae Seok kicks it hard.)

1256
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,871
- Okay.
- So Min. It's yours.

1257
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:34,940
- Hit it with your head.
- So Min.

1258
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,071
- There you go.
- It worked.

1259
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:38,281
(Jumping)

1260
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:39,380
- It's good.
- Well done.

1261
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:40,710
(Did I do well?)

1262
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:42,810
- Kick it smoothly. Se Chan.
- Well done.

1263
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,020
Kick it smoothly. That's it.

1264
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,181
- Okay.
- Ji Hyo.

1265
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,520
(Everyone stops. What happened?)

1266
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,060
- You can't catch it.
- Let him kick next time.

1267
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,290
- That's not how you play it.
- Nice.

1268
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:54,491
- Yes!
- Was that a violation of the rules?

1269
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,000
- Are we playing dodgeball or what?
- Is this dodgeball?

1270
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,661
(Teasing)

1271
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,831
(We got one point.)

1272
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:02,000
- You're teasing us?
- Yes, we ought to.

1273
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,071
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1274
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:04,631
- Really? Okay. Fine.
- We got a point.

1275
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,471
- I see how it is.
- You weaklings

1276
00:44:07,471 --> 00:44:09,540
Let's kick the ball to Ji Hyo.

1277
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,617
- Don't let it bother you, Ji Hyo.
- I got it.

1278
00:44:11,641 --> 00:44:12,741
- Kick it back.
- Okay.

1279
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,411
Nice serve.

1280
00:44:14,411 --> 00:44:17,081
(Jong Kook from Team White serves the ball.)

1281
00:44:17,081 --> 00:44:18,281
- Nice serve.
- Great.

1282
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:21,121
It's out!

1283
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,621
- It's out. Okay!
- It's out.

1284
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:24,661
(Is it really out?)

1285
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,060
That's all right.

1286
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,891
- Because it was over the line?
- Okay!

1287
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:31,407
(Okay. The psychological warfare begins. I'm going to tease them.)

1288
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:32,431
Okay.

1289
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,101
(Pulling up)

1290
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:37,270
(Se Chan gets back at Jae Seok.)

1291
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:39,801
(Ji Hyo comes to aid.)

1292
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:44,581
(She teases them by getting on the net.)

1293
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,150
- Ji Hyo, stop it.
- Why?

1294
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,150
- Why should I?
- Seriously.

1295
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,781
- Ji Hyo, get off the net.
- She's crazy.

1296
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:51,851
Why?

1297
00:44:51,851 --> 00:44:53,691
(She can't hold back her celebratory gesture.)

1298
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,150
- Get off.
- She's crazy.

1299
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,520
- Why can't I do that?
- What are you doing?

1300
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,821
(The score is 1 to 1.)

1301
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,431
- Let's go!
- Let's do this!

1302
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:03,360
(Team Black serves.)

1303
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,661
- I got it.
- It's over.

1304
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:05,701
It's under control.

1305
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,871
It's mine. So Min, you won't kick, right?

1306
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,170
- No, I will.
- No, don't do it.

1307
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:13,871
(She hesitates and rushes.)

1308
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:16,710
I want to kick it.

1309
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,081
So Min, it's yours.

1310
00:45:18,281 --> 00:45:19,851
(Se Chan kicks it over on So Min's behalf.)

1311
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:20,911
Haha.

1312
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:22,250
(Hitting lightly)

1313
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,380
(Team Black loses a point due to the weak pass.)

1314
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,527
- Okay.
- It took only one exchange.

1315
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:29,290
(That's right. This is how it ought to be.)

1316
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,821
(My gosh, they are getting on my nerves.)

1317
00:45:32,821 --> 00:45:34,931
(Team White leads 2 to 1.)

1318
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,090
- I'll start.
- Okay.

1319
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:37,860
There it goes.

1320
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,161
Out.

1321
00:45:39,161 --> 00:45:41,571
(It goes out of the line.)

1322
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:43,340
What's wrong with me?

1323
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,900
- Okay.
- It's okay.

1324
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,440
- Good job, Jong Kook.
- It's okay.

1325
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,640
(It's okay if it's Jong Kook.)

1326
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,880
Wait, Jong Kook made mistakes twice while serving.

1327
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,380
- Why doesn't someone else serve?
- It's okay.

1328
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,451
You did well, Jong Kook.

1329
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,051
- It's okay.
- Is there anyone else?

1330
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:57,520
- You lost two points because of...
- Don't worry about it.

1331
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,121
- His bad serving.
- It's not your problem.

1332
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:01,351
- Listen.
- Is this foot volleyball?

1333
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:03,420
- What's wrong?
- We're having fun, so leave us.

1334
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,360
(We're having fun. It's not your business.)

1335
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,661
- We're having fun.
- That's right.

1336
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:08,831
Isn't it harsh to tell us to leave?

1337
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:10,601
- What do you mean?
- Come in.

1338
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,101
- It's none of your business.
- Isn't he being too harsh?

1339
00:46:13,101 --> 00:46:14,230
- I've never heard that.
- It's not your business.

1340
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,900
That was a good expression.

1341
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,000
I made him confused.

1342
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,201
We use that expression in my neighborhood.

1343
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:19,301
"It's none of your business."

1344
00:46:19,301 --> 00:46:21,610
If the ball lands close, kick the ball, Se Chan.

1345
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:23,141
It's mine.

1346
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,781
- To the side.
- Person in the front should kick.

1347
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,440
- It's mine.
- Get out of the way.

1348
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,650
Shouldn't the person at the front kick?

1349
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,681
That's good.

1350
00:46:29,681 --> 00:46:30,821
(Team White sends the ball over the net.)

1351
00:46:30,821 --> 00:46:32,051
- That's good.
- Kick it.

1352
00:46:32,051 --> 00:46:33,051
Jae Seok.

1353
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:34,590
- Good job.
- It's mine.

1354
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:35,821
(It's my ball.)

1355
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,520
(He kicks.)

1356
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:40,590
(It really hurts.)

1357
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,590
He kicked himself.

1358
00:46:41,831 --> 00:46:43,031
Two touches!

1359
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,661
I meant to...

1360
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,031
I knew it.

1361
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:48,071
(Look at how he moves.)

1362
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:49,630
This is what's funny.

1363
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,670
Only Jong Kook can kick the first ball.

1364
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,077
(Only Jong Kook can kick the first ball.)

1365
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,511
(He always kicks the first one.)

1366
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,011
- It's how it is.
- Is it?

1367
00:46:56,011 --> 00:46:57,281
- No.
- Is that so?

1368
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,310
Be quiet.

1369
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,911
- I'm sorry but...
- Be quiet.

1370
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:01,650
Shouldn't you kick if the ball lands closer?

1371
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,281
- We did.
- When he ran forward,

1372
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:05,321
- everyone got out of his way.
- This is so funny.

1373
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:07,081
- I saw it.
- When Seok Jin tried to kick...

1374
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,367
- They moved out of his way.
- Everyone's jaws dropped.

1375
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,161
This is how you play.

1376
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,491
- Don't be offended.
- You're right.

1377
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,790
- Everyone has different skills.
- Of course.

1378
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,550
(Team White gets ahead thanks to Jong Kook.)

1379
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:22,701
- Let's play naturally.
- That was a great, short kick.

1380
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,170
- Wait.
- It's Jong Kook's.

1381
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,241
- There you go.
- I'll kick.

1382
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:29,011
- I'll kick.
- You do it.

1383
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,351
(She misses the ball.)

1384
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,781
(Se Chan was prepared to kick it.)

1385
00:47:41,121 --> 00:47:43,051
All right, that's how it should go.

1386
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:45,520
- This is good.
- We'll win.

1387
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,630
Let's do it.

1388
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,460
- So Min, say that it's yours.
- Good job.

1389
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,230
- So Min.
- Say, "It's mine."

1390
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:52,261
- There's Se Chan.
- Until the line...

1391
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:54,371
- So Min, it's okay.
- There's Se Chan.

1392
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:56,130
Go.

1393
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,201
(Their scores are tied.)

1394
00:47:57,201 --> 00:47:58,340
I got it.

1395
00:47:59,201 --> 00:48:00,241
Get ready, So Min.

1396
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,571
- It's yours.
- It's okay.

1397
00:48:01,571 --> 00:48:02,871
- Did it work?
- That's good.

1398
00:48:02,971 --> 00:48:04,241
Wait.

1399
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,040
- Wait.
- Go, Ji Hyo.

1400
00:48:07,081 --> 00:48:08,951
- Come on, Seok Jin.
- It's done.

1401
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:10,420
(He grits his teeth.)

1402
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:14,690
- Seok Jin.
- I told you to leave it.

1403
00:48:15,721 --> 00:48:18,721
The ball landed here. How could I leave it?

1404
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:19,860
In that case,

1405
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,931
- if it landed there, - Goodness.

1406
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,531
Just kick it lightly.

1407
00:48:23,531 --> 00:48:25,730
How much will you do when you're in the back?

1408
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:27,031
- Seok Jin.
- What?

1409
00:48:27,031 --> 00:48:29,631
Why don't you make eye contact with Jong Kook after your mistake?

1410
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,601
I'm looking at him right now.

1411
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:36,270
(He looks at the empty space near him.)

1412
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,610
(Team White falls behind by 1 point.)

1413
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,351
- That's good.
- Good.

1414
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,880
- It's late.
- Nice.

1415
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,226
- Be careful. It'll be hard.
- Kick it.

1416
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:45,420
That's right.

1417
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,491
(He makes a strong kick.)

1418
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,520
There you go.

1419
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,161
(Seok Jin kicks the ball.)

1420
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,161
(People are surprised by him.)

1421
00:48:54,491 --> 00:48:55,560
There you go.

1422
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,431
(He saves the ball quickly.)

1423
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,460
(It hits his face.)

1424
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,730
(The ball hits the front of his face.)

1425
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,601
- Oh, no.
- Poor Seok Jin.

1426
00:49:05,871 --> 00:49:07,310
Seok Jin.

1427
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,371
Are you okay?

1428
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,641
I feel terrible for him.

1429
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,810
- What's going on?
- Please take out the scene.

1430
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,411
Did it scratch your face?

1431
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,520
It really hurts.

1432
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,281
- Are you okay?
- You're red.

1433
00:49:19,281 --> 00:49:21,750
I thought you took off the glasses to sleep.

1434
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:24,090
I thought you were crying with your glasses off.

1435
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:27,190
- They're upside down.
- Take them off. You have no lenses.

1436
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:29,931
(Seok Jin with glasses can't kick the ball.)

1437
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:31,601
You should put something on the nose.

1438
00:49:31,801 --> 00:49:34,400
I uploaded a photo of me and my father on social network.

1439
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,871
Half of the people thought it's Seok Jin.

1440
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:39,040
(They look similar.)

1441
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,110
That's what I thought.

1442
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,241
- Seriously?
- My dad was born in 1943.

1443
00:49:42,241 --> 00:49:43,511
Is that your father?

1444
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:45,110
Is it your father in the photo?

1445
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,551
- Yes.
- Isn't it Seok Jin?

1446
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:48,511
- It's my dad.
- He's 23 years older than me.

1447
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:49,781
(Team White: 3 points, Team Black: 5 points.)

1448
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,051
That's funny.

1449
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:53,121
It doesn't matter at all.

1450
00:49:53,221 --> 00:49:54,690
- Haha.
- Okay.

1451
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,951
(Jong Kook serves.)

1452
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:58,621
Go and kick it.

1453
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,290
(Haha hits the ball.)

1454
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:02,860
Go and kick it. Kick it over the net.

1455
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,180
(Jae Seok sends it to Kwang Soo.)

1456
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:06,230
- Let's go.
- It went over.

1457
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:07,601
Come to me, So Min.

1458
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,971
- It's okay. Good job.
- Go.

1459
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:12,871
(Seok Jin hits the ball with the back of his head.)

1460
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:15,141
That's good.

1461
00:50:15,141 --> 00:50:17,480
(Se Chan suddenly spikes the ball.)

1462
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,040
You're doing well, Se Chan.

1463
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:20,851
It's now.

1464
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,310
(Haha hits it again.)

1465
00:50:22,411 --> 00:50:23,750
- Okay.
- Kick it.

1466
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,621
(She misses.)

1467
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:27,150
(She misses.)

1468
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:29,520
Don't do anything.

1469
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,090
Just stay still.

1470
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:33,991
- I told you to say, "It's mine."
- Give the signal.

1471
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:35,761
I thought...

1472
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:37,031
That was good.

1473
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:39,301
I was ready to kick, but you changed its direction.

1474
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:40,630
It fell on me.

1475
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,170
- The ball fell on me.
- It's okay.

1476
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:44,571
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1477
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:46,471
(Haha serves the ball.)

1478
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,540
All right.

1479
00:50:47,741 --> 00:50:48,770
(Jong Kook receives the ball safely.)

1480
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,840
(Kicking)

1481
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,210
Try it, So Min.

1482
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,810
(The ball finally goes to So Min.)

1483
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,721
(It's a golden opportunity.)

1484
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,351
- It's mine.
- Try it.

1485
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:01,891
(It's mine.)

1486
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,460
(Team White: 3 points, Team Black: 7 points.)

1487
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,130
- Hey.
- Say, "It's mine".

1488
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:09,431
Say it before kicking.

1489
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,701
What's the point of saying it after kicking?

1490
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:14,670
(He shouts angrily.)

1491
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,331
Why would you say it while kicking?

1492
00:51:16,331 --> 00:51:17,971
Say it before kicking.

1493
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,170
That's how you get the ball.

1494
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,170
It's not a shout.

1495
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:23,911
"It's mine," isn't a shout.

1496
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:25,340
- "It's mine."
- It means you'll kick.

1497
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,250
- I thought you were shouting.
- Let's go.

1498
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,380
- It's mine.
- It's mine.

1499
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:31,051
- It means that you'll kick it.
- Let's go.

1500
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,721
When is foot volleyball over?

1501
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,351
When is it over?

1502
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:35,821
(She has trouble with the phrase.)

1503
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,121
(Jong Kook serves.)

1504
00:51:38,121 --> 00:51:39,761
You did a very good job.

1505
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,601
- There it goes.
- So Min.

1506
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:44,630
That's right, Ji Hyo.

1507
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,230
That's right.

1508
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
(Ji Hyo's...)

1509
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,440
(Ji Hyo's powerful spike)

1510
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,710
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

1511
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:56,511
- That's right.
- How did you do it?

1512
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:58,110
- You play so well.
- Seriously.

1513
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:00,380
- My heart is about to burst.
- Ji Hyo is good.

1514
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,610
What's going on?

1515
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,321
(The score gap gets wider.)

1516
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:05,351
That was great.

1517
00:52:06,181 --> 00:52:07,351
(Jong Kook serves nicely.)

1518
00:52:07,351 --> 00:52:08,391
This looks pretty.

1519
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,920
- Go.
- Can we do that?

1520
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,761
- Hurry.
- This is difficult.

1521
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:12,891
- It's hard for Kwang Soo.
- Ji Hyo.

1522
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:13,960
(He sends it to Ji Hyo.)

1523
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,431
- It'll be hard for Ji Hyo.
- Go.

1524
00:52:15,431 --> 00:52:18,531
(With her sharp smash, she sends the ball to Jong Kook.)

1525
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:21,531
She plays well.

1526
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,246
- It's out.
- It'll be hard for Ji Hyo.

1527
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,340
(Ji Hyo's spear...)

1528
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,241
(pierces into Jong Kook's shield.)

1529
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:31,610
- You play well, Ji Hyo.
- You're the best.

1530
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:34,310
(It's out.)

1531
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:36,581
- You play well, Ji Hyo.
- It's my fault.

1532
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:39,321
- I know it's my fault.
- Look at that.

1533
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,360
(It's Jong Kook who made a mistake.)

1534
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,690
(Everyone except Jong Kook feels guilty.)

1535
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,460
(Let's do better since it's my fault.)

1536
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,860
- You play well, Ji Hyo.
- No one says anything.

1537
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,031
- What's going on?
- It's my fault.

1538
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:55,230
No one says anything.

1539
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:56,431
What's going on?

1540
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,201
Why are you looking at me?

1541
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,040
Why are you looking at me without saying anything?

1542
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,770
- It's my fault.
- He admits that it's his mistake.

1543
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,911
- Why are you looking at me?
- We can't get angry at him.

1544
00:53:03,911 --> 00:53:05,310
- He made a mistake.
- How can we say anything...

1545
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,210
when he admits that he made a mistake?

1546
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,081
How can we say anything?

1547
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:11,781
I'm frustrated. I haven't looked at him in the eye for 20 minutes.

1548
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,991
Be quiet, and let's play.

1549
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:17,121
Let's go.

1550
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:19,460
We got it.

1551
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:21,431
Kick it over.

1552
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,491
- That's right.
- Se Chan.

1553
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:23,801
Kick it over.

1554
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,161
Okay.

1555
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:26,670
That's nice.

1556
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:27,701
(Due to Jong Kook and Se Chan...)

1557
00:53:27,701 --> 00:53:29,000
My goodness.

1558
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:30,670
Okay, it's out.

1559
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:33,511
The scores are tied.

1560
00:53:34,371 --> 00:53:35,971
This is match point.

1561
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,681
- Let's give it a try.
- I'm too excited.

1562
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,480
- Okay.
- We can do it.

1563
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,051
It's neck and neck.

1564
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:42,880
Let's play.

1565
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,321
(Kwang Soo serves.)

1566
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,851
To this side. Nice.

1567
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:48,491
(Kwang Soo serves well.)

1568
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:49,551
Get closer, So Min.

1569
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:50,661
(Jong Kook receives it with stability.)

1570
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:52,020
Kick it over right away.

1571
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,960
- Kick it over.
- Kick it over.

1572
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,431
Just kick it over.

1573
00:53:55,431 --> 00:53:57,630
(They react to the attack.)

1574
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:00,931
- That was good.
- Jae Seok, kick it.

1575
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:01,931
Nice.

1576
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,201
(Jae Seok's strong spike)

1577
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:05,471
(Seok Jin plays defense.)

1578
00:54:05,471 --> 00:54:07,340
That's good. It's mine.

1579
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,511
- Se Chan.
- Kick it over.

1580
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,980
Okay.

1581
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,551
(It's a strong spike.)

1582
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:15,310
- That's good.
- Get ready.

1583
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,121
- That's right.
- Send it.

1584
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,451
(He tries to hit it, )

1585
00:54:20,451 --> 00:54:22,121
(but it is too far.)

1586
00:54:22,221 --> 00:54:23,761
- What do we do?
- Kwang Soo.

1587
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:25,560
- What do we do?
- Seriously.

1588
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:27,391
I tried my best.

1589
00:54:27,391 --> 00:54:29,060
(The final score is 10 to 9.)

1590
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,101
What did you think?

1591
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,900
My spike was strong, wasn't it?

1592
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,770
- You did it.
- We won.

1593
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,431
- Okay.
- Did we win?

1594
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:37,571
(Team White wins 10 minutes of free time.)

1595
00:54:37,571 --> 00:54:38,741
We're too good for them.

1596
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,646
- We're too good for them.
- I agree.

1597
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:42,170
- Okay.
- We were so close.

1598
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:43,340
- I'm sorry.
- We were so close.

1599
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,880
Team White gets 10 minutes of free time.

1600
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,210
You may eat.

1601
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,310
(10-minute break starts.)

1602
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,980
- What about us?
- Shouldn't...

1603
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,520
only Jong Kook and Se Chan go?

1604
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,190
Come here, So Min.

1605
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,250
(Misty Time 1)

1606
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,261
From now on,

1607
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,090
- Misty Time.
- Misty Time will start.

1608
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,130
- Okay.
- That's right.

1609
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:03,900
The staff prepared Misty Time...

1610
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,871
to give you a special chance.

1611
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:08,701
(The staff prepared something special.)

1612
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:10,571
Do we get exemptions?

1613
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:11,670
What is it?

1614
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,141
- What could it be?
- Many badges might depend on it.

1615
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,181
My battery is already... I didn't mean battery.

1616
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:20,250
- Seok Jin...
- My goodness.

1617
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:22,210
Goodness.

1618
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:23,980
(They're surprised.)

1619
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:25,351
- What is it?
- They're here.

1620
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:27,590
(What is this music?)

1621
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:31,020
- It's Twice.
- It's a girl group.

1622
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,261
- Who are they?
- All of them are here.

1623
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:37,031
(In the shortest time, their music video is viewed by 50 million.)

1624
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:40,201
(K-pop phenomenon, Twice)

1625
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:42,301
(Twice is here.)

1626
00:55:42,301 --> 00:55:43,601
- Hey.
- Nice to see you.

1627
00:55:43,601 --> 00:55:44,701
Sana.

1628
00:55:45,071 --> 00:55:46,540
Momo.

1629
00:55:46,571 --> 00:55:49,540
Get out of the way. They have to perform.

1630
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:52,480
- I love your song.
- They have to perform.

1631
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,451
Twice is here again.

1632
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,621
- I love you.
- Twice

1633
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,380
Twice

1634
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,690
(We love Twice.)

1635
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,150
Twice

1636
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,261
Twice

1637
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,460
Here we go.

1638
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,900
- Hey.
- Let's go!

1639
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,801
(Cheerful)

1640
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:15,431
(The nine girls want to know what love is.)

1641
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:16,670
(What is love?)

1642
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,701
I love it.

1643
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:21,141
Yes!

1644
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:22,411
(The whole team is here.)

1645
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,181
(Yes!)

1646
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,451
- Twice!
- Twice rocks!

1647
00:56:27,451 --> 00:56:28,451
(Welcome)

1648
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,051
It's comforting.

1649
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:31,420
By the way,

1650
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,780
they're here to celebrate Se Chan and So Min's anniversary.

1651
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,920
They even gave a performance.

1652
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,690
Congratulations.

1653
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,090
(Thank you, Twice.)

1654
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,790
They came for you?

1655
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:44,161
- Twice is very busy.
- Right.

1656
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,500
Every time they make a comeback,

1657
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,801
- they attract so much attention.
- It's incredible.

1658
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,601
- It's their eighth hit.
- Really?

1659
00:56:50,601 --> 00:56:52,400
- 100 million views.
- It's amazing.

1660
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,786
Their music video attracted 100 million views.

1661
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:57,411
Last time, we met in Busan a year ago.

1662
00:56:57,411 --> 00:56:59,710
- Please introduce yourselves.
- Okay.

1663
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,351
- 1, 2, 3.
- One in a million.

1664
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,520
- Hello, we're Twice.
- Hello, we're Twice.

1665
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,221
(They're so cute.)

1666
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:07,650
- Can we hear...
- What?

1667
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:09,290
Sana say, "cheese gimbap"?

1668
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,491
- Please say it.
- Not now.

1669
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:12,690
- I want to hear it.
- It's not the right time.

1670
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,060
- Our viewers want to hear it too.
- Be quiet.

1671
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,391
- Let's hear it.
- Let's hear it.

1672
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:16,860
- Right now...
- It's very cute.

1673
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,500
Let's hear it.

1674
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,130
- They need to introduce themselves.
- It's really cute.

1675
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,301
Let them introduce themselves.

1676
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:22,801
Why do you decide?

1677
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,500
(Let them introduce themselves.)

1678
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,400
(Why do you decide?)

1679
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,471
Move!

1680
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,310
- What are you doing?
- Calm down.

1681
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,710
What are you doing?

1682
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:32,141
- I mean...
- What is this?

1683
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:34,210
- Everyone wants to hear it.
- What are you doing?

1684
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:36,880
- Everyone wants to hear it.
- Gosh.

1685
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,721
Everyone is glaring at you.

1686
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,391
- It's really cute.
- Hold on.

1687
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:43,020
Are you all glaring at me because of cheese gimbap?

1688
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,221
- You want to hear it, right?
- Yes.

1689
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,130
- Make some noise!
- Yes!

1690
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,391
Yes!

1691
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,630
- See?
- Seriously.

1692
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,471
Gosh, he never listens.

1693
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:58,615
- Then Sana, can you say, "cheese gimbap"?
- Sure.

1694
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,918
Please count down for me.

1695
00:57:59,918 --> 00:58:02,347
- 1, 2, 3, start.
- 1, 2, 3, start.

1696
00:58:02,561 --> 00:58:06,113
- Then Sana, can you say, "cheese gimbap"?
- Sure.

1697
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:07,323
Please count down for me.

1698

- 1, 2, 3, start.
- 1, 2, 3, start.

1699
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:11,022
Cheese gimbap.

1700
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:15,093
(Cheese gimbap)

1701
00:58:15,963 --> 00:58:18,463
I don't know what it is, but I like it.

1702
00:58:18,463 --> 00:58:21,102
(I don't know what it is, but I like it.)

1703
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:23,232
"Cheese gimbap".

1704
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:24,832
(Let me try.)

1705
00:58:24,832 --> 00:58:25,903
She's just being cute.

1706
00:58:25,903 --> 00:58:27,102
So Min, can you do it?

1707
00:58:27,102 --> 00:58:29,573
Say, "fart gimbap". "Fart gimbap".

1708
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,812
Pretend you're farting. Try it. "Fart gimbap".

1709
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:35,783
- What?
- Stop it.

1710
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:37,482
- Stop it.
- Try it.

1711
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:39,153
"Fart gimbap".

1712
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:42,082
- Fart gimbap.
- Fart.

1713
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:43,653
(Fart gimbap)

1714
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,653
- Fart too.
- Fart.

1715
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:47,022
- Fart - Fart

1716
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:50,332
(Cheese gimbap for Twice, fart gimbap for Running Man)

1717
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:52,093
(Farting)

1718
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:53,432
She's accepted it.

1719
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,932
Anyway, "What is Love?" is...

1720
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,903
their new song.

1721
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:00,473
It has some unique dance moves.

1722
00:59:00,473 --> 00:59:04,243
Could one of you teach us?

1723
00:59:04,243 --> 00:59:06,582
Sure. Momo will teach you.

1724
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:07,883
- Okay.
- Okay.

1725
00:59:07,883 --> 00:59:10,013
- Momo will teach us.
- Momo...

1726
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,383
As you're wondering about love...

1727
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:13,852
- A question mark.
- Okay.

1728
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:14,952
"Where is my love?"

1729
00:59:15,723 --> 00:59:17,292
(What is love?)

1730
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:18,892
- What is love?
- You need a dot.

1731
00:59:18,892 --> 00:59:21,863
We don't have much time. Let's speed up.

1732
00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:22,963
Start.

1733
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:24,763
(What is love?)

1734
00:59:24,763 --> 00:59:26,763
All right. Next.

1735
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,102
- Next?
- Yes.

1736
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:30,033
You're wondering this time too.

1737
00:59:30,073 --> 00:59:31,202
We can do hard ones too.

1738
00:59:31,202 --> 00:59:32,832
- A more difficult one.
- We can do it.

1739
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:34,002
They look down on us.

1740
00:59:34,002 --> 00:59:36,042
- I saw something like this.
- This is too...

1741
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:38,412
This is not exactly a dance move.

1742
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:39,888
- Please teach us something else.
- We can do it.

1743
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:42,082
There's something like this.

1744
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:45,653
- That's too difficult.
- It is?

1745
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,053
- That's too...
- Not this?

1746
00:59:47,053 --> 00:59:49,383
We want something in the middle.

1747
00:59:49,892 --> 00:59:51,823
Between the 1st one and the 2nd one...

1748
00:59:51,823 --> 00:59:53,292
How about this?

1749
00:59:53,292 --> 00:59:54,792
- That's nice.
- That's perfect.

1750
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,072
I like that kind of dance moves.

1751
00:59:57,062 --> 00:59:58,932
- I think we can do that.
- Okay.

1752
00:59:58,932 --> 00:59:59,932
We can do that.

1753
01:00:00,403 --> 01:00:02,232
We can do that.

1754
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:04,803
Right after that, you make a question mark.

1755
01:00:04,803 --> 01:00:05,803
How?

1756
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:06,973
(Flapping)

1757
01:00:07,502 --> 01:00:09,073
That's nice. Good job.

1758
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:12,113
(What is love?)

1759
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:13,743
He's so cute.

1760
01:00:14,042 --> 01:00:15,843
So Min used to be a singer.

1761
01:00:15,843 --> 01:00:18,013
- That's not true.
- She was a trainee.

1762
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,283
- Try it.
- Start.

1763
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:21,082
(Fart song)

1764
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:24,122
(Farting)

1765
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,323
(What is a fart?)

1766
01:00:27,093 --> 01:00:30,193
All right. We've...

1767
01:00:30,232 --> 01:00:33,662
heard from Twice briefly.

1768
01:00:33,662 --> 01:00:37,033
Now... Are they flies?

1769
01:00:37,502 --> 01:00:38,932
(You punks!)

1770
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:41,202
(Get away!)

1771
01:00:41,202 --> 01:00:42,903
Are they crazy?

1772
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,312
- How dare...
- Kwang Soo.

1773
01:00:45,312 --> 01:00:46,812
- What are they doing?
- Flies...

1774
01:00:46,812 --> 01:00:48,482
(He's so tough.)

1775
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:50,653
Look at Kwang Soo.

1776
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:51,982
(I'll kill you all.)

1777
01:00:53,013 --> 01:00:54,053
(Laughing)

1778
01:00:54,053 --> 01:00:57,193
We'll play a simple game...

1779
01:00:57,193 --> 01:00:59,193
- with Twice.
- Really?

1780
01:00:59,392 --> 01:01:01,562
Twice wrote down nine talents.

1781
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:04,292
- We'll pick two of them.
- Sounds good.

1782
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:07,502
Including a mission, there will be three rounds.

1783
01:01:07,602 --> 01:01:10,403
The winning team of each round can choose one member...

1784
01:01:10,403 --> 01:01:12,202
- who will get 2 penalty badges.
- 2?

1785
01:01:12,202 --> 01:01:13,202
(2 penalty badges)

1786
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:15,042
Two?

1787
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:16,943
1 person gets 2 badges?

1788
01:01:16,943 --> 01:01:19,272
The winning team decides who will get two badges.

1789
01:01:19,272 --> 01:01:21,142
It means you need to divide into teams.

1790
01:01:21,482 --> 01:01:23,682
We'll decide the partners...

1791
01:01:23,682 --> 01:01:25,213
- by drawing spoons.
- Okay.

1792
01:01:25,213 --> 01:01:28,223
There are different colors. Some teams will consist of...

1793
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:30,193
- only girls.
- Only girls.

1794
01:01:30,193 --> 01:01:32,892
Also, one team will have three members.

1795
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:36,432
Okay? Twice, please draw a spoon each.

1796
01:01:36,662 --> 01:01:38,193
(Twice starts drawing spoons.)

1797
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:39,903
Blue.

1798
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,932
- Purple.
- I like everyone.

1799
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:46,673
(Teams)

1800
01:01:46,943 --> 01:01:48,502
The rest of you...

1801
01:01:48,502 --> 01:01:49,573
(It's Team Running Man's turn.)

1802
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:51,642
- Please draw a spoon each.
- It's important.

1803
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:54,613
Seok Jin's partner will be decided.

1804
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:57,053
(Nervous)

1805
01:01:57,182 --> 01:01:58,883
- Don't draw a pink spoon.
- Seok Jin.

1806
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,482
No pink spoon.

1807
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:02,582
- Yellow-green.
- Yellow-green.

1808
01:02:02,582 --> 01:02:04,223
(Seok Jin draws a yellow-green spoon.)

1809
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:06,093
(Who has a yellow-green spoon?)

1810
01:02:06,252 --> 01:02:07,323
(She pops out.)

1811
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:09,792
Chae Young.

1812
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,593
Her smile looks sad.

1813
01:02:11,593 --> 01:02:12,593
Right now...

1814
01:02:12,593 --> 01:02:13,602
(Poor Chae Young.)

1815
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:15,403
It's time to work.

1816
01:02:16,202 --> 01:02:17,973
- You should work hard.
- I'm happy.

1817
01:02:17,973 --> 01:02:19,473
Work hard, Chae Young.

1818
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:22,772
- Haha.
- I'm friends with everyone.

1819
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,513
- Blue.
- Blue.

1820
01:02:24,513 --> 01:02:25,673
(Haha draws a blue spoon.)

1821
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:27,783
- Me.
- We were partners last time too.

1822
01:02:27,783 --> 01:02:28,783
(Jeong Yeon)

1823
01:02:28,783 --> 01:02:29,783
(Puzzled)

1824
01:02:30,352 --> 01:02:32,182
(We were partners last time too.)

1825
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:33,252
(We were?)

1826
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:36,022
(I don't remember well.)

1827
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:37,892
It's so embarrassing.

1828
01:02:37,892 --> 01:02:39,963
- Maybe you weren't.
- Stop being so clingy.

1829
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:41,593
- Gosh.
- I...

1830
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:43,662
I hate this kind of thing.

1831
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:44,693
What's with him?

1832
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:46,502
- Are you doing well?
- Yes.

1833
01:02:46,502 --> 01:02:48,463
Nice to see you.

1834
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:50,232
- Next.
- Okay.

1835
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:51,702
(Kwang Soo)

1836
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:53,202
- Purple.
- Purple.

1837
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:55,202
(Me)

1838
01:02:55,202 --> 01:02:57,312
- Hello.
- They don't like each other.

1839
01:02:57,312 --> 01:02:59,812
- That's not true.
- They don't like each other.

1840
01:02:59,812 --> 01:03:01,843
- That's not true.
- It shows.

1841
01:03:01,843 --> 01:03:02,912
- You don't like me?
- It shows too much.

1842
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:04,213
- I like you.
- She likes me.

1843
01:03:04,383 --> 01:03:06,283
- Are you okay? Mina.
- Yes?

1844
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,053
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm good.

1845
01:03:08,053 --> 01:03:10,852
Whom did you want to be partners with?

1846
01:03:10,852 --> 01:03:12,852
- By the way...
- What's so wrong with me?

1847
01:03:13,392 --> 01:03:14,392
What?

1848
01:03:15,193 --> 01:03:18,133
(Teams)

1849
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:21,662
Let's see what talents they wrote.

1850
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,502
Twice members wrote them down, right?

1851
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:26,002
- Things they're good at.
- Yes.

1852
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,502
Let me pick one.

1853
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:29,502
Okay.

1854
01:03:29,702 --> 01:03:32,213
Let's check this one.

1855
01:03:32,213 --> 01:03:34,182
(What is the first talent?)

1856
01:03:34,182 --> 01:03:36,013
Who wrote, "Cute Acrostic Poem"?

1857
01:03:36,653 --> 01:03:38,283
- Who wrote it?
- Who wrote it?

1858
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:40,482
The one who said, "cheese gimbap"?

1859
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:42,223
- Sana?
- Did Sana write it?

1860
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:44,923
- "Cheese gimbap"?
- I wrote it.

1861
01:03:44,923 --> 01:03:45,923
(Shy)

1862
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:47,223
Na Yeon?

1863
01:03:47,593 --> 01:03:51,493
(Na Yeon's Cute Acrostic Poem)

1864
01:03:52,062 --> 01:03:55,403
Not everyone can pull it off.

1865
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:57,803
It doesn't suit everyone.

1866
01:03:57,903 --> 01:03:59,303
You can't beat Sana.

1867
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:02,743
- Na Yeon, will you start?
- Okay.

1868
01:04:03,213 --> 01:04:05,513
We'll try "Kim Jong Kook".

1869
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:06,912
- Kim Jong Kook?
- Kim Jong Kook?

1870
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:08,582
- "Kook" would be difficult.
- Okay.

1871
01:04:08,682 --> 01:04:10,682
Here we go. "Kim Jong Kook".

1872
01:04:10,682 --> 01:04:11,713
"Kim".

1873
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:14,383
I want some kimchi fried rice.

1874
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:17,452
(I want some kimchi fried rice.)

1875
01:04:18,522 --> 01:04:20,423
This is what she means.

1876
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,593
She's good. She's very expressive.

1877
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:23,693
Good. Continue.

1878
01:04:24,162 --> 01:04:25,193
"Jong".

1879
01:04:25,193 --> 01:04:28,863
I want to eat it with Jong Kook.

1880
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:30,033
Oh, dear.

1881
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,102
(This is driving me insane.)

1882
01:04:31,102 --> 01:04:32,973
- This is real.
- This is the last one.

1883
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,272
She's getting ready for it.

1884
01:04:34,673 --> 01:04:35,702
"Kook".

1885
01:04:35,702 --> 01:04:37,243
("Kook")

1886
01:04:38,312 --> 01:04:40,283
(She makes cute, baby noises.)

1887
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:41,912
(She makes cute, baby noises.)

1888
01:04:43,752 --> 01:04:46,053
(She makes cute, baby noises.)

1889
01:04:47,223 --> 01:04:48,852
How are you supposed to beat that?

1890
01:04:49,053 --> 01:04:51,622
(She's speechless.)

1891
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:53,522
I've never seen her like that.

1892
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:55,162
Remember I said...

1893
01:04:55,263 --> 01:04:58,193
I was an expert in retreats?

1894
01:04:58,193 --> 01:04:59,693
She's an expert in being cute.

1895
01:04:59,693 --> 01:05:01,502
- That's true.
- Goodness.

1896
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,252
I think she should be selected as a living cultural asset.

1897
01:05:04,403 --> 01:05:05,573
She was incredible.

1898
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:06,772
Let's continue.

1899
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,943
Who would like to challenge her? If there's nobody, we win.

1900
01:05:10,213 --> 01:05:11,473
Ji Hyo can do it too.

1901
01:05:11,573 --> 01:05:12,943
- Ji Hyo can do this?
- She's ready.

1902
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:14,283
- Can you do it, Ji Hyo?
- Yes.

1903
01:05:14,283 --> 01:05:15,312
All right.

1904
01:05:15,383 --> 01:05:16,513
What is the word?

1905
01:05:17,252 --> 01:05:19,213
- Jong Kook.
- Jong Kook's name.

1906
01:05:19,213 --> 01:05:20,423
Me again?

1907
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:21,629
(This acrostic poem is dedicated to Jong Kook.)

1908
01:05:21,653 --> 01:05:23,723
Why am I not Lee Kwang Kook?

1909
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:26,053
Too bad I'm not Lee Kwang Kook.

1910
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,323
- "Kim".
- Go to him.

1911
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:32,033
Please tell me you're going to make me kimchi fried rice.

1912
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:37,772
(Please tell me you're going to make me kimchi fried rice.)

1913
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,142
- What was that?
- She's good.

1914
01:05:40,702 --> 01:05:43,073
- What did she just do?
- Goodness. Look at her face.

1915
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,473
I hate it.

1916
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,843
Twice members hate it.

1917
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:48,383
Why?

1918
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:49,783
It's "Jong" next.

1919
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:51,653
Jong Kook?

1920
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,752
- Oh, gosh.
- "Kook".

1921
01:05:55,582 --> 01:05:58,022
(Promise me.)

1922
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,463
(She's so cute.)

1923
01:06:00,463 --> 01:06:01,593
Oh, dear.

1924
01:06:01,823 --> 01:06:03,533
Oh, my.

1925
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:05,662
I wasn't going to say this,

1926
01:06:06,093 --> 01:06:07,633
but when Na Yeon started,

1927
01:06:08,033 --> 01:06:09,932
Ji Hyo said, "What is wrong with her?"

1928
01:06:10,872 --> 01:06:12,272
(Ji Hyo transformed.)

1929
01:06:12,732 --> 01:06:13,872
Kimchi fried rice.

1930
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:14,943
(He twists his body.)

1931
01:06:16,412 --> 01:06:19,372
(When it was Na Yeon's turn...)

1932
01:06:19,372 --> 01:06:20,743
What is wrong with her?

1933
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,943
(What is wrong with her?)

1934
01:06:22,482 --> 01:06:24,053
Momo...

1935
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:25,912
- got really mad too, - Gosh.

1936
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:27,352
But she's practicing right now.

1937
01:06:27,723 --> 01:06:28,852
(This is more competitive than they thought.)

1938
01:06:28,852 --> 01:06:30,452
It's funny seeing her practice.

1939
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:33,522
Did you see that? This is a very close match.

1940
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:34,993
For ours,

1941
01:06:35,263 --> 01:06:38,332
Jong Kook will be talking to Momo on the phone.

1942
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,332
- Really?
- Is that part of the acrostic poem?

1943
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,662
- We'll use Momo's name.
- Momo's name?

1944
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,432
This is a tough day for Jong Kook.

1945
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:45,732
"Mo".

1946
01:06:45,732 --> 01:06:47,943
- Hello?
- Hello.

1947
01:06:48,443 --> 01:06:51,443
- "Mo".
- Momo would like kimchi fried rice.

1948
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,813
(Momo would like kimchi fried rice.)

1949
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,612
- Hold on.
- One kimchi fried rice, please.

1950
01:06:58,612 --> 01:07:00,383
Is this a kimchi fried rice special?

1951
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:01,659
- Did you open a restaurant?
- Sorry?

1952
01:07:01,683 --> 01:07:03,423
Yes, I opened a restaurant.

1953
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:04,853
- She ordered.
- It's for delivery.

1954
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:06,353
Is it for delivery?

1955
01:07:06,423 --> 01:07:07,899
- It's a delivery application.
- One more, please.

1956
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:09,593
We'll hurry.

1957
01:07:10,063 --> 01:07:11,263
Good job.

1958
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:13,162
Who's next?

1959
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:14,832
- Would you like to try?
- Do whatever you want.

1960
01:07:14,832 --> 01:07:16,103
- Would you like to?
- Yes.

1961
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,803
- I'll use my partner's name.
- Really?

1962
01:07:18,803 --> 01:07:20,742
- Haha or Dong Hoon?
- Haha.

1963
01:07:20,742 --> 01:07:22,173
This one better be good.

1964
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:23,813
- Haha.
- "Ha".

1965
01:07:24,942 --> 01:07:26,112
Ha Dong Hoon!

1966
01:07:27,713 --> 01:07:29,542
- "Ha".
- Don't do it.

1967
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:34,282
(Let's don't do it.)

1968
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:35,983
(He takes her back.)

1969
01:07:36,752 --> 01:07:38,492
- That was cute.
- That was.

1970
01:07:38,553 --> 01:07:41,223
Let's focus.

1971
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:43,692
That was cute.

1972
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:44,893
Wasn't that cute?

1973
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,133
Wasn't she good?

1974
01:07:50,173 --> 01:07:52,372
- Do you want to try, Sana?
- Okay.

1975
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,643
- Jae Seok, Sana is ready.
- I'll do it.

1976
01:07:56,742 --> 01:07:58,713
- Jae Seok.
- Sana wants to try?

1977
01:07:58,713 --> 01:08:00,282
- Is it Jong Kook's name?
- Sana.

1978
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:02,713
- Sana?
- Your own name?

1979
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:03,883
You're going to use your own name?

1980
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:06,183
- She has a partner.
- Or Se...

1981
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,683
- It's possible.
- It's fine.

1982
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,923
- She's advertising herself.
- Right.

1983
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:11,093
Sana. "Sa".

1984
01:08:11,622 --> 01:08:13,192
What's love?

1985
01:08:15,362 --> 01:08:17,792
- I'm curious.
- "Na".

1986
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:20,532
I think it's you.

1987
01:08:20,532 --> 01:08:22,502
(I think it's you.)

1988
01:08:24,072 --> 01:08:28,303
(I think it's you.)

1989
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:29,673
(This is driving me nuts.)

1990
01:08:31,372 --> 01:08:32,742
(What is wrong with her?)

1991
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,213
They're going nuts.

1992
01:08:34,213 --> 01:08:36,483
What do I do? Is this even possible?

1993
01:08:36,652 --> 01:08:38,112
Is this possible?

1994
01:08:38,112 --> 01:08:41,423
(Sana is a strong candidate for 1st place with her acrostic poem.)

1995
01:08:41,853 --> 01:08:43,452
What about you, Tzuyu?

1996
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:45,093
Jong Kook can do it too.

1997
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:46,822
What would you like to use?

1998
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:50,362
- I'll use my name.
- Tzuyu?

1999
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:52,063
It won't be easy.

2000
01:08:52,063 --> 01:08:53,402
It's hard.

2001
01:08:54,103 --> 01:08:55,303
"Tzu".

2002
01:08:56,002 --> 01:08:57,133
Tzuyu is...

2003
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:58,372
(She uses her nasal voice.)

2004
01:08:58,372 --> 01:09:00,542
This is so nice. What now?

2005
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:02,273
"Yu".

2006
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:04,412
- I have a stomachache.
- Oh, no.

2007
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,112
(I have a stomachache.)

2008
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:08,942
Give her some medicine. Where's the medicine?

2009
01:09:08,942 --> 01:09:12,112
(Nobody has tried to act cute by having a stomachache.)

2010
01:09:12,112 --> 01:09:13,282
Medicine for stomachache.

2011
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,723
That wasn't bad.

2012
01:09:14,723 --> 01:09:16,622
- Tzuyu has a stomachache.
- I know.

2013
01:09:17,152 --> 01:09:18,393
That breaks my heart.

2014
01:09:18,393 --> 01:09:19,452
(Smiling)

2015
01:09:19,452 --> 01:09:21,923
You are all good at acrostic poems.

2016
01:09:22,563 --> 01:09:24,933
- They can all do it.
- It's so natural.

2017
01:09:24,992 --> 01:09:27,633
She'll finish it off.

2018
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:28,832
(Na Yeon will finish it off.)

2019
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:32,473
(This was supposed to be her talent, so she'll end it off.)

2020
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:33,773
Then we'll accept the loss.

2021
01:09:34,372 --> 01:09:36,742
- What would you like to use?
- I'll use...

2022
01:09:38,143 --> 01:09:39,572
Kwang Soo's name.

2023
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:41,513
(I'll use Kwang Soo's name.)

2024
01:09:41,582 --> 01:09:43,752
- Kwang Soo?
- This will drive him insane.

2025
01:09:43,752 --> 01:09:45,383
- Let's start with "Lee".
- Okay.

2026
01:09:46,152 --> 01:09:48,252
- "Lee".
- From now on...

2027
01:09:48,252 --> 01:09:50,322
(From now on!)

2028
01:09:50,322 --> 01:09:53,492
- "Kwang".
- Kwang Soo will fall for me.

2029
01:09:53,492 --> 01:09:56,162
(Kwang Soo will fall for me.)

2030
01:09:57,433 --> 01:10:00,103
(Kwang Soo will fall for me.)

2031
01:10:00,832 --> 01:10:02,702
He's in trouble. He already fell for her.

2032
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:04,872
Kwang Soo, you're in trouble.

2033
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:08,303
- "Soo".
- Abracadabra.

2034
01:10:08,343 --> 01:10:10,213
(Screaming)

2035
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:14,313
(Abracadabra!)

2036
01:10:14,313 --> 01:10:16,853
(What do I do?)

2037
01:10:18,952 --> 01:10:21,152
That was awesome. Why is she so good?

2038
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:23,093
- I approve.
- Me too.

2039
01:10:23,692 --> 01:10:26,523
Good job. That was good.

2040
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:27,963
Kwang Soo is in trouble.

2041
01:10:28,162 --> 01:10:30,733
- He fell in love.
- What should he do?

2042
01:10:31,763 --> 01:10:33,303
You need to wake up from the spell.

2043
01:10:33,303 --> 01:10:34,502
Look at Mina.

2044
01:10:34,502 --> 01:10:36,572
He went somewhere else.

2045
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:38,933
Kwang Soo, Mina is mad at you.

2046
01:10:38,933 --> 01:10:40,143
Don't be.

2047
01:10:40,242 --> 01:10:41,803
That was great.

2048
01:10:41,803 --> 01:10:43,513
You're so good. I'm not joking.

2049
01:10:43,513 --> 01:10:46,173
Both of hers...

2050
01:10:46,173 --> 01:10:47,782
- were good.
- This is too good.

2051
01:10:47,782 --> 01:10:49,542
Team Jae Seok wins...

2052
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:51,983
in Cute Acrostic Poem.

2053
01:10:51,983 --> 01:10:53,782
He picked a good one.

2054
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:58,853
I'll pick a team who'll take these two stickers.

2055
01:10:58,952 --> 01:11:00,423
I have four right now.

2056
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:03,093
If I give this person 2, he'll end up with 5.

2057
01:11:03,093 --> 01:11:04,292
(He's a strong candidate with 3 stickers.)

2058
01:11:04,292 --> 01:11:05,433
Right.

2059
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:08,133
It'll go to him.

2060
01:11:08,133 --> 01:11:10,433
There might be somebody who's right behind me.

2061
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:12,273
That sounds good.

2062
01:11:12,433 --> 01:11:14,242
I like the three-way battle.

2063
01:11:14,473 --> 01:11:16,542
You want to avoid coming last.

2064
01:11:16,612 --> 01:11:17,813
- That's right.
- You can't be last.

2065
01:11:17,813 --> 01:11:20,213
If you don't want to be last, you have to give them to Seok Jin.

2066
01:11:20,213 --> 01:11:21,313
That's not true.

2067
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:22,633
Should I give three to Kwang Soo?

2068
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:24,733
- Should I give three to Kwang Soo?
- Kwang Soo?

2069
01:11:24,853 --> 01:11:26,252
(Should I give 3 to Kwang Soo?)

2070
01:11:26,252 --> 01:11:27,322
Me?

2071
01:11:27,752 --> 01:11:29,822
I'm on your side. Jae Seok.

2072
01:11:29,853 --> 01:11:32,252
It'll be weird if Kwang Soo doesn't join this party.

2073
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:34,692
No, Jae Seok. I only have one.

2074
01:11:35,362 --> 01:11:38,463
Okay, I'll give two to Kwang Soo.

2075
01:11:38,463 --> 01:11:40,963
(Kwang Soo wasn't worried, but he gets 2 penalty badges.)

2076
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,063
Really?

2077
01:11:43,072 --> 01:11:44,273
- Okay.
- Okay.

2078
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:46,173
- Okay.
- You have to win.

2079
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:47,442
I have a goal now.

2080
01:11:47,843 --> 01:11:49,143
They're getting started.

2081
01:11:49,143 --> 01:11:50,773
They're getting started again. I'm sick of this.

2082
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,013
- Let's do this.
- Okay, let's get started.

2083
01:11:53,082 --> 01:11:54,282
Let's do this.

2084
01:11:55,542 --> 01:11:58,412
Ji Hyo, would you like to pick the next one?

2085
01:11:58,412 --> 01:11:59,553
- Me?
- Yes.

2086
01:12:00,423 --> 01:12:02,723
(This game will decide who'll get 2 penalty badges.)

2087
01:12:02,723 --> 01:12:03,952
- I'll pick.
- What is it?

2088
01:12:04,122 --> 01:12:05,292
- I'll pick this one.
- Okay.

2089
01:12:05,423 --> 01:12:07,963
(The second game is Dance.)

2090
01:12:07,963 --> 01:12:09,692
- Dance.
- Good.

2091
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:11,593
Dance.

2092
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,702
(This is what they were hoping for.)

2093
01:12:13,702 --> 01:12:15,563
- The time has come.
- Is it any dancing?

2094
01:12:15,563 --> 01:12:16,603
Who wrote that?

2095
01:12:16,872 --> 01:12:18,372
Twice is all good at dancing.

2096
01:12:18,433 --> 01:12:21,002
- Momo.
- Is it Momo?

2097
01:12:21,442 --> 01:12:23,513
Momo is unrivaled.

2098
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:26,173
What's this about?

2099
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:27,643
Dancing.

2100
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,313
(What do you think it is?)

2101
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,853
- Is it any dancing?
- I know that.

2102
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:34,122
(What's wrong?)

2103
01:12:34,223 --> 01:12:36,622
- Do you think we don't know?
- What else could it be?

2104
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,853
I know it's dancing, but it's not just any dancing.

2105
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:40,122
It's freestyle.

2106
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,822
- Is it freestyle?
- Yes.

2107
01:12:41,822 --> 01:12:44,162
- Freestyle.
- Momo will start off.

2108
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:47,433
If there's another team that's better than Momo...

2109
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:48,702
- Right.
- Right?

2110
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:50,973
Momo is so good.

2111
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,473
Momo started dancing since she was three.

2112
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:57,242
(She's so good.)

2113
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:59,042
- Isn't that too young?
- I'm serious.

2114
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,343
- You'll get hurt at three.
- I'm serious.

2115
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:03,582
Do you remember dancing at three?

2116
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:04,782
Yes.

2117
01:13:05,483 --> 01:13:07,383
If we're to rate this,

2118
01:13:07,652 --> 01:13:11,353
who are the best dancers in Twice? What do you think?

2119
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,362
Momo is in first place, and everybody else is the same.

2120
01:13:13,362 --> 01:13:15,423
- Everybody else?
- Everybody else is the same?

2121
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:16,563
She's unrivaled.

2122
01:13:16,662 --> 01:13:18,263
- Completely?
- Yes.

2123
01:13:18,492 --> 01:13:21,032
- Are you that good?
- No.

2124
01:13:21,103 --> 01:13:23,502
- Jeong Yeon whispered to me.
- What did she say?

2125
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:25,202
- She's going to crush Momo.
- When did I say that?

2126
01:13:25,202 --> 01:13:27,803
(Jeong Yeon said she's going to crush Momo.)

2127
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:31,042
(She's going to crush her?)

2128
01:13:31,343 --> 01:13:33,082
- She's going to rip her apart.
- Will you?

2129
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,362
- When did I say that?
- She'll spin her three times.

2130
01:13:35,643 --> 01:13:37,013
Spin her around.

2131
01:13:37,353 --> 01:13:38,853
Then...

2132
01:13:38,912 --> 01:13:41,923
- let's see Momo dance first.
- Let's see.

2133
01:13:42,082 --> 01:13:44,622
- All right, Momo.
- Good luck.

2134
01:13:44,622 --> 01:13:46,053
(Good luck, partner.)

2135
01:13:47,822 --> 01:13:51,792
(She starts off by taking off her jacket.)

2136
01:13:51,792 --> 01:13:53,733
(She's so confident.)

2137
01:13:54,603 --> 01:13:56,103
Goodness.

2138
01:13:56,902 --> 01:13:58,822
- I love these kinds of dances.
- The song is...

2139
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:02,402
She's so sexy.

2140
01:14:02,402 --> 01:14:04,742
(This dance contrasts her cute face.)

2141
01:14:04,742 --> 01:14:05,872
She's so good.

2142
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,013
(She's so relaxed.)

2143
01:14:07,013 --> 01:14:08,082
She's good.

2144
01:14:08,483 --> 01:14:09,713
What was that?

2145
01:14:11,053 --> 01:14:15,053
(She shows off a body wave.)

2146
01:14:15,053 --> 01:14:16,723
You've changed a lot.

2147
01:14:16,723 --> 01:14:18,423
- She's really good.
- What is this?

2148
01:14:18,423 --> 01:14:19,763
(She's so good! How can we beat her?)

2149
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:20,822
We can't win this.

2150
01:14:20,822 --> 01:14:22,923
When we meant dancing, we didn't mean this.

2151
01:14:23,532 --> 01:14:25,932
- This is professional dancing.
- Gosh, how can we beat her?

2152
01:14:26,532 --> 01:14:29,162
How can the other contestants dance after you're done?

2153
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:31,702
- This is...
- She's good.

2154
01:14:31,902 --> 01:14:33,173
- Gosh.
- She's coming.

2155
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,173
- We can win.
- We can beat her.

2156
01:14:35,173 --> 01:14:36,572
We can win thanks to Ji Hyo.

2157
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:38,412
We can win now. We can win!

2158
01:14:38,412 --> 01:14:40,483
- We can beat them now.
- We can do it.

2159
01:14:40,483 --> 01:14:43,013
- This isn't too bad.
- It's over. We can do it now.

2160
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:45,183
- You failed.
- We can do this.

2161
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,553
(Swaying)

2162
01:14:47,553 --> 01:14:48,752
This isn't too bad.

2163
01:14:49,122 --> 01:14:50,322
What should I do?

2164
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:51,992
- It's over now.
- Oh, my.

2165
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,593
It's over now. We can win thanks to Ji Hyo.

2166
01:14:56,593 --> 01:15:00,633
(Despite the mean comments, she showed off her dancing skills.)

2167
01:15:00,633 --> 01:15:02,202
- You're really cool, Momo.
- She's so cool.

2168
01:15:02,202 --> 01:15:04,103
She's really good with rhythm.

2169
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:05,133
- It was great.
- She's really good.

2170
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,473
We'll change it into a couple dance game...

2171
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:09,242
because she's too good.

2172
01:15:09,242 --> 01:15:11,742
If you count Ji Hyo's dance, we can win them.

2173
01:15:11,742 --> 01:15:14,883
(We can win if you include Ji Hyo's dance.)

2174
01:15:14,883 --> 01:15:16,112
We can win thanks to Ji Hyo.

2175
01:15:16,112 --> 01:15:18,483
- Their performance wasn't great.
- It was great.

2176
01:15:18,553 --> 01:15:20,483
- Really?
- It was.

2177
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,082
It was an eyesore.

2178
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,893
- Eyesore? Gosh.
- No.

2179
01:15:23,893 --> 01:15:25,553
- Gosh.
- If you're that confident,

2180
01:15:25,553 --> 01:15:27,093
you should try too.

2181
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:28,723
We'll dance again at the end.

2182
01:15:28,723 --> 01:15:31,963
In that case, does that mean we just need to...

2183
01:15:31,963 --> 01:15:34,763
dance better than Ji Hyo and Momo?

2184
01:15:34,763 --> 01:15:36,803
We'll turn the music on.

2185
01:15:36,803 --> 01:15:38,433
Each team should dance together.

2186
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:40,442
What do you mean you don't know? Just do it.

2187
01:15:40,442 --> 01:15:41,603
- All right.
- Music start.

2188
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:44,612
Gosh, "Havana".

2189
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:46,983
- We can't dance to this.
- We need to dance to this?

2190
01:15:47,213 --> 01:15:49,782
- This is...
- This is impossible.

2191
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:51,383
Jeon So Min.

2192
01:15:51,383 --> 01:15:52,582
(You can't dance to this? Then I will.)

2193
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:53,782
Ji Hyo.

2194
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:55,683
- Ji Hyo.
- She's coming out.

2195
01:15:55,853 --> 01:15:58,093
They're coming out to the stage.

2196
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,362
(She throws her hat...)

2197
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:02,292
(and shows off her wave.)

2198
01:16:02,492 --> 01:16:04,292
She just did her iconic dance move.

2199
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:07,933
(Here goes So Min's pelvic dance!)

2200
01:16:08,303 --> 01:16:09,633
Gosh.

2201
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,032
(Swaying)

2202
01:16:13,032 --> 01:16:14,103
It's exactly the same.

2203
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:15,743
(I'm dancing just like Ji Hyo, aren't I?)

2204
01:16:16,303 --> 01:16:18,112
Ji Hyo, you should go out to the front.

2205
01:16:18,112 --> 01:16:19,782
- What's So Min doing?
- What?

2206
01:16:19,782 --> 01:16:21,143
It's "Havana".

2207
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:24,082
How can you dance like that to "Havana"?

2208
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:29,223
(It's a collaboration of her weird expressions and swaying body.)

2209
01:16:29,223 --> 01:16:30,822
What is that dance move?

2210
01:16:30,822 --> 01:16:32,992
- What is she doing?
- Gosh.

2211
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:35,593
It's "Havana".

2212
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:37,492
- It's better.
- Good.

2213
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,662
Let's go. Let's have Mina next.

2214
01:16:39,662 --> 01:16:40,862
- Let's go.
- Mina.

2215
01:16:41,233 --> 01:16:42,662
Let's have Mina first.

2216
01:16:43,103 --> 01:16:44,372
It's Mina.

2217
01:16:44,372 --> 01:16:45,433
(Mina, )

2218
01:16:45,433 --> 01:16:49,242
(I'm going out too.)

2219
01:16:50,343 --> 01:16:51,542
(His long and useless body flaps wildly.)

2220
01:16:51,542 --> 01:16:52,643
What is that?

2221
01:16:52,643 --> 01:16:54,343
(His long and useless body flaps wildly.)

2222
01:16:55,383 --> 01:16:56,952
(Flapping)

2223
01:16:57,782 --> 01:16:59,082
(Visual shock)

2224
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,282
- What is that?
- Gosh, what is that?

2225
01:17:01,353 --> 01:17:02,752
It's a human-faced bird.

2226
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:07,622
(It's the last surviving human-faced bird.)

2227
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,192
(It's a huge creature that measures 190cm. It represents peace.)

2228
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,532
Gosh.

2229
01:17:13,603 --> 01:17:15,002
It's a human-faced bird.

2230
01:17:15,002 --> 01:17:17,332
It's a huge bird that has the face of a man.

2231
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:21,603
(Flapping in joy and happiness while celebrating peace in Korea)

2232
01:17:22,473 --> 01:17:23,973
(You didn't need to come out to the stage, Kwang Soo.)

2233
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,313
She's so pretty.

2234
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:27,782
The Running Man members should come out after the Twice members.

2235
01:17:27,782 --> 01:17:30,152
If we come out from the start, it just becomes a huge mess.

2236
01:17:30,152 --> 01:17:32,082
(The Running Man members ruin the stage.)

2237
01:17:32,082 --> 01:17:33,152
All right.

2238
01:17:33,152 --> 01:17:35,923
- We want to see Twice first.
- Stay put, Kwang Soo.

2239
01:17:36,122 --> 01:17:37,723
I was just following her.

2240
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:40,292
- We'll see Twice's dancing, - Yes!

2241
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:41,652
And then we'll have you join them.

2242
01:17:41,723 --> 01:17:43,133
That's right.

2243
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:44,763
You're good at emceeing.

2244
01:17:44,763 --> 01:17:47,633
And I don't think this dance fits "Havana".

2245
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:52,002
(So Min, this dance doesn't fit the song.)

2246
01:17:52,002 --> 01:17:54,603
You should zoom in on her facial expression.

2247
01:17:54,843 --> 01:17:55,902
She was so into it.

2248
01:17:56,542 --> 01:17:57,742
What is that?

2249
01:17:57,742 --> 01:17:58,872
She usually...

2250
01:17:59,112 --> 01:18:01,813
- She usually dances like that.
- Gosh.

2251
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,183
That's how she dances.

2252
01:18:04,353 --> 01:18:05,683
Why does she do that?

2253
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:06,883
Play the music again.

2254
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:07,883
(We'll start the music again.)

2255
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:08,952
What is this song?

2256
01:18:08,952 --> 01:18:10,252
- First, - Da Hyun.

2257
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:11,393
Da Hyun.

2258
01:18:11,492 --> 01:18:12,692
- She's going out.
- Da Hyun.

2259
01:18:12,692 --> 01:18:15,723
- She's really good at funny dances.
- Really?

2260
01:18:15,723 --> 01:18:17,362
- She's so brazen.
- Gosh.

2261
01:18:17,362 --> 01:18:19,492
You need to dance by yourself.

2262
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:22,332
- She's good.
- She looks really cool.

2263
01:18:22,563 --> 01:18:23,673
She's good at dancing.

2264
01:18:23,673 --> 01:18:25,433
She's becoming one with the music.

2265
01:18:25,433 --> 01:18:27,173
- Gosh.
- She's good.

2266
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:28,962
- What's that?
- Da Hyun's doing great.

2267
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:30,713
- What's that?
- She's great.

2268
01:18:31,072 --> 01:18:32,173
It's so cool.

2269
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:33,313
Good.

2270
01:18:33,343 --> 01:18:34,813
It's cool but also refined.

2271
01:18:35,643 --> 01:18:37,213
She wants you to join her.

2272
01:18:37,282 --> 01:18:38,888
- What are you looking at?
- What are you looking at?

2273
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:40,223
What's she looking at?

2274
01:18:40,223 --> 01:18:41,983
- What are you looking at?
- Da Hyun.

2275
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,192
(She's staring at the sky as if she's possessed.)

2276
01:18:43,192 --> 01:18:45,192
- It's coming!
- It's coming!

2277
01:18:46,463 --> 01:18:47,463
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

2278
01:18:47,463 --> 01:18:50,933
(Energetic)

2279
01:18:51,332 --> 01:18:53,702
(She rules the stage with her energetic dance moves.)

2280
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:55,233
- What's that?
- This is really good.

2281
01:18:55,233 --> 01:18:56,603
This is the best.

2282
01:18:56,603 --> 01:18:58,202
- She has a weird facial expression!
- It's really good.

2283
01:18:58,202 --> 01:18:59,233
It's so cool.

2284
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:01,402
- What is this?
- Da Hyun.

2285
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,173
- Gosh.
- What are you?

2286
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,282
(This is not the end.)

2287
01:19:08,883 --> 01:19:09,952
What is that?

2288
01:19:10,252 --> 01:19:11,282
What are you doing?

2289
01:19:11,612 --> 01:19:13,723
- What is that?
- Gosh.

2290
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:15,353
- Look at her.
- Hey!

2291
01:19:15,782 --> 01:19:17,652
- Gosh.
- Gosh, it's so cool.

2292
01:19:18,152 --> 01:19:19,423
Look.

2293
01:19:19,593 --> 01:19:21,122
She's really good.

2294
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:27,332
(She's like a dance machine.)

2295
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:28,433
Gosh.

2296
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,902
Da Hyun is really great.

2297
01:19:30,273 --> 01:19:32,402
- Gosh.
- She's like a squid.

2298
01:19:32,402 --> 01:19:33,872
- What's she looking at?
- What are you?

2299
01:19:33,872 --> 01:19:36,143
Da Hyun, what were you looking at?

2300
01:19:36,143 --> 01:19:37,813
- Do you see ghosts?
- Do you?

2301
01:19:38,213 --> 01:19:39,313
Da Hyun.

2302
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:40,883
- What were you looking at?
- I've never seen a possessed dance.

2303
01:19:40,883 --> 01:19:42,313
I was really surprised.

2304
01:19:42,313 --> 01:19:47,683
(Her eyes look lost as if she's possessed.)

2305
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,282
All right. You can go back, Da Hyun.

2306
01:19:49,282 --> 01:19:50,353
- That was cool.
- Did you see that?

2307
01:19:50,353 --> 01:19:52,223
- She's good.
- It was a difficult music too.

2308
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:53,622
- It's difficult.
- It is.

2309
01:19:54,162 --> 01:19:55,963
Let's go to the next person. Music, please.

2310
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:57,763
(The next music is...)

2311
01:19:57,763 --> 01:20:00,263
("Fire" by BTS.)

2312
01:20:01,362 --> 01:20:03,973
(I need to dance to this.)

2313
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:05,233
It's not for couple dancing.

2314
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:06,902
- It's not for couple dancing.
- Why do you keep coming out?

2315
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:08,202
Wait.

2316
01:20:08,202 --> 01:20:10,072
- It's not for couple dancing.
- "Fire".

2317
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:14,813
(I'm sorry for coming out again, but I need to dance to this.)

2318
01:20:15,313 --> 01:20:17,013
This is a song for Da Hyun.

2319
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:18,853
(She imitates the exact dance moves by being possessed by BTS.)

2320
01:20:18,853 --> 01:20:20,782
- She memorized everything.
- Gosh.

2321
01:20:21,183 --> 01:20:22,622
She can do everything.

2322
01:20:22,782 --> 01:20:24,452
- She's so good.
- What is she?

2323
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:26,093
Momo, you're in danger.

2324
01:20:26,093 --> 01:20:27,463
- I am.
- You are.

2325
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:28,893
Wait.

2326
01:20:29,563 --> 01:20:30,733
Da Hyun.

2327
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,032
I get that you like dancing, but stop coming out to the stage.

2328
01:20:33,032 --> 01:20:35,563
(I'm sorry, but please stop.)

2329
01:20:35,563 --> 01:20:37,032
- Others should get a chance too.
- I couldn't stop myself.

2330
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,532
It was supposed to be a couple dance,

2331
01:20:39,532 --> 01:20:41,172
but she's trying to stand out by herself.

2332
01:20:41,273 --> 01:20:42,402
- She goes out by herself.
- But...

2333
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:44,872
- this doesn't have to be.
- Really?

2334
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:47,912
Momo is the one who said it was her specialty,

2335
01:20:47,983 --> 01:20:49,952
but Da Hyun was the best so far.

2336
01:20:49,952 --> 01:20:51,213
- Da Hyun was really good.
- No.

2337
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:53,523
She's by far the best.

2338
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:54,752
- Okay.
- Okay.

2339
01:20:54,752 --> 01:20:56,593
- The others should try too.
- Momo, get ready.

2340
01:20:56,593 --> 01:20:58,899
If you think you can do it, you can come out again, Da Hyun.

2341
01:20:58,923 --> 01:21:00,923
- Give us the music.
- This is so fun.

2342
01:21:01,263 --> 01:21:03,563
Momo, if you think you can do it, you should try.

2343
01:21:05,593 --> 01:21:08,402
(I can dance to this song.)

2344
01:21:08,402 --> 01:21:09,433
Oh, my.

2345
01:21:09,733 --> 01:21:10,832
"Gashina".

2346
01:21:10,832 --> 01:21:12,402
(Why do you leave pretty Momo here?)

2347
01:21:13,773 --> 01:21:19,412
(She's doing Sun Mi's dance moves perfectly to get first place.)

2348
01:21:19,412 --> 01:21:20,542
She looks so cool.

2349
01:21:20,542 --> 01:21:24,713
(It really is her specialty.)

2350
01:21:25,282 --> 01:21:26,723
Da Hyun came out too.

2351
01:21:29,483 --> 01:21:31,652
(Da Hyun is dancing again.)

2352
01:21:31,652 --> 01:21:33,192
She went down further.

2353
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:34,992
- Gosh.
- Look at her back folding.

2354
01:21:34,992 --> 01:21:36,532
Gosh.

2355
01:21:36,532 --> 01:21:37,593
(Satisfied)

2356
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,063
It's over. It's over now.

2357
01:21:39,492 --> 01:21:40,933
- She's doing great.
- Wait.

2358
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,402
- She's great.
- Excuse me.

2359
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:44,173
- It's over.
- Excuse me. Can you stop the music?

2360
01:21:44,173 --> 01:21:45,173
Wait.

2361
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:46,542
(What was that?)

2362
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:48,343
She shot the gun down here.

2363
01:21:48,343 --> 01:21:50,072
- Hey.
- She went all the way down.

2364
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:52,442
After she went down, Momo shot Da Hyun.

2365
01:21:52,442 --> 01:21:54,483
- She shot Da Hyun.
- Momo became a little angry.

2366
01:21:54,582 --> 01:21:56,713
- She shot her.
- It's going wild.

2367
01:21:57,782 --> 01:21:59,183
(Da Hyun, how can you do this?)

2368
01:21:59,183 --> 01:22:02,553
(She shoots.)

2369
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:05,893
- Gosh, she shot her.
- It was a weapon.

2370
01:22:06,423 --> 01:22:08,723
- Momo is angry too.
- She's the best.

2371
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:11,032
Da Hyun and Momo are doing great.

2372
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:14,303
But others like Na Yeon have their chances too.

2373
01:22:14,433 --> 01:22:16,832
Chae Young, you shouldn't stay still.

2374
01:22:17,002 --> 01:22:19,572
- You two should rest.
- All right.

2375
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:21,572
(Momo and Da Hyun need to take a rest!)

2376
01:22:21,572 --> 01:22:24,112
Tie them up. They're so good.

2377
01:22:24,112 --> 01:22:25,773
- Mina can see ghosts too.
- What?

2378
01:22:25,773 --> 01:22:27,782
(My partner can be possessed too.)

2379
01:22:27,782 --> 01:22:29,713
- Mina can see ghosts too.
- All right.

2380
01:22:29,713 --> 01:22:31,782
Na Yeon is getting ready too.

2381
01:22:31,853 --> 01:22:33,553
Give us the music.

2382
01:22:35,782 --> 01:22:38,223
- It's "Nice".
- It's Seventeen's song.

2383
01:22:39,152 --> 01:22:40,223
"Nice".

2384
01:22:40,223 --> 01:22:42,063
Who's going to go first?

2385
01:22:42,192 --> 01:22:43,292
Jeong Yeon?

2386
01:22:43,862 --> 01:22:44,893
- Jeong Yeon.
- Go.

2387
01:22:45,463 --> 01:22:47,063
- Let's go, Jeong Yeon.
- She's going.

2388
01:22:47,063 --> 01:22:48,303
(She's starting to dance.)

2389
01:22:50,973 --> 01:22:52,433
What's this? What is this?

2390
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:55,402
(Doggy dance?)

2391
01:22:55,742 --> 01:22:57,143
You don't need to be funny.

2392
01:22:57,143 --> 01:22:59,042
- I can't do this.
- You don't need to do that.

2393
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:00,112
I can't win them.

2394
01:23:00,112 --> 01:23:01,942
- Do something cool.
- Jeong Yeon and Haha are out.

2395
01:23:01,942 --> 01:23:03,752
- No!
- You're out!

2396
01:23:03,752 --> 01:23:05,152
We were going to do something cool.

2397
01:23:05,252 --> 01:23:07,353
- Out!
- How can we beat them?

2398
01:23:07,353 --> 01:23:09,853
- We can't win.
- How can you do a doggy dance?

2399
01:23:09,853 --> 01:23:11,423
- How?
- It's really hard.

2400
01:23:11,423 --> 01:23:13,492
- Just wait a little.
- That was too much.

2401
01:23:13,992 --> 01:23:15,723
Give us the next music.

2402
01:23:16,532 --> 01:23:17,692
It's hard.

2403
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,202
- What's this?
- It sounds cool.

2404
01:23:21,603 --> 01:23:24,572
(They're hesitating because of the cool music.)

2405
01:23:24,572 --> 01:23:26,502
Do you want to try? Do you want to go?

2406
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:29,402
Chae Young is going.

2407
01:23:29,402 --> 01:23:31,042
(Chae Young goes out to the stage.)

2408
01:23:31,042 --> 01:23:32,912
- Gosh.
- That's good.

2409
01:23:32,912 --> 01:23:35,343
- Gosh.
- It's hammer dance.

2410
01:23:35,513 --> 01:23:36,853
Hammer dance.

2411
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:38,612
She's good.

2412
01:23:39,752 --> 01:23:41,322
(She's doing well too.)

2413
01:23:41,322 --> 01:23:42,952
Gosh.

2414
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:44,122
That's right.

2415
01:23:44,122 --> 01:23:46,023
(Should I try too?)

2416
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:48,393
(Powerful break dance)

2417
01:23:48,393 --> 01:23:50,292
That's great, Na Yeon.

2418
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,633
That's it. Go on.

2419
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:55,633
(She fights against Chae Young's hammer dance with her break dance.)

2420
01:23:55,633 --> 01:23:57,202
Use your arms.

2421
01:23:57,202 --> 01:23:58,372
Sana!

2422
01:23:58,502 --> 01:24:00,143
- That's right.
- Sana!

2423
01:24:00,143 --> 01:24:01,273
Sana!

2424
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:03,273
(Right)

2425
01:24:03,273 --> 01:24:04,742
This is the newest dance move.

2426
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:07,313
(That's the trendy dance.)

2427
01:24:07,313 --> 01:24:08,612
(I want to try too.)

2428
01:24:09,683 --> 01:24:10,912
(Dancing left and right)

2429
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:12,213
(Speeding up)

2430
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:13,322
Gosh.

2431
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:15,252
(Going full speed)

2432
01:24:17,423 --> 01:24:19,963
They are giving it their all.

2433
01:24:20,792 --> 01:24:23,063
- Ji Hyo, go!
- My goodness.

2434
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:24,862
- Mina, let's go!
- Ji Hyo!

2435
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:26,332
Let's go!

2436
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:29,202
(Ji Hyo and Mina shyly go out to dance.)

2437
01:24:30,202 --> 01:24:31,233
Mina!

2438
01:24:31,233 --> 01:24:34,473
(Mina dances shyly at first.)

2439
01:24:34,473 --> 01:24:37,813
(Then she suddenly transforms into a middle-aged man.)

2440
01:24:38,112 --> 01:24:40,143
What is that?

2441
01:24:41,112 --> 01:24:42,713
Mina, you don't have to do that!

2442
01:24:43,713 --> 01:24:44,952
What is Mina doing?

2443
01:24:45,683 --> 01:24:47,353
What is Mina doing?

2444
01:24:47,353 --> 01:24:49,273
(Although she doesn't have to, Mina tries hard.)

2445
01:24:49,452 --> 01:24:52,192
- Thank you, Mina.
- She can dance well.

2446
01:24:52,923 --> 01:24:54,023
I was so surprised.

2447
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:56,063
- She didn't have to do that.
- I was taken by surprise.

2448
01:24:56,063 --> 01:24:57,893
- She is tying her shoelaces.
- She is tying her shoelaces.

2449
01:24:57,893 --> 01:24:59,832
(Momo ties her shoelaces.)

2450
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:01,133
- No, no.
- Look at Momo.

2451
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:03,502
She has never danced to this kind of music.

2452
01:25:03,733 --> 01:25:05,832
- I know.
- Yes, I have.

2453
01:25:05,832 --> 01:25:08,143
All right. Music, start.

2454
01:25:08,673 --> 01:25:09,813
They are really good.

2455
01:25:10,942 --> 01:25:13,183
(What is this song with a familiar intro?)

2456
01:25:13,183 --> 01:25:15,483
It's "Bboom Bboom".

2457
01:25:16,183 --> 01:25:18,152
- Na Yeon!
- What? Momo stepped forward again.

2458
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:19,612
(It's "Bboom Bboom" by Momoland.)

2459
01:25:19,612 --> 01:25:20,622
(My goodness.)

2460
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:24,152
(I should stop dancing.)

2461
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:25,923
Let's go!

2462
01:25:26,252 --> 01:25:28,792
(Momo and Da Hyun are addicted to dancing.)

2463
01:25:28,792 --> 01:25:31,233
(Bboom bboom)

2464
01:25:31,532 --> 01:25:33,433
- Hold on.
- Did you see that?

2465
01:25:33,902 --> 01:25:35,563
They are like shamans.

2466
01:25:36,702 --> 01:25:38,072
They are like shamans.

2467
01:25:38,072 --> 01:25:43,643
(The shamans who can dance well perform an exorcism.)

2468
01:25:44,013 --> 01:25:45,072
All right.

2469
01:25:45,072 --> 01:25:47,742
(The audience channels the spirit as well.)

2470
01:25:48,383 --> 01:25:50,213
(Momo and Da Hyun's rendezvous)

2471
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:52,183
Where are they looking at?

2472
01:25:52,183 --> 01:25:54,723
Da Hyun is leading.

2473
01:25:54,723 --> 01:25:56,822
Da Hyun has a good strategy.

2474
01:25:57,423 --> 01:26:00,093
Come back. Come back.

2475
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:02,622
- Everyone.
- I need to stop.

2476
01:26:03,362 --> 01:26:06,133
- My goodness.
- I am sorry.

2477
01:26:06,192 --> 01:26:09,133
- I can tell that Momo...
- She can dance well.

2478
01:26:09,162 --> 01:26:11,332
Has danced for many years.

2479
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:14,143
- However, Da Hyun...
- She grabs my attention.

2480
01:26:14,143 --> 01:26:16,173
Is getting a lot of points.

2481
01:26:16,173 --> 01:26:18,112
Da Hyun channeled a spirit.

2482
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,143
You are right.

2483
01:26:19,343 --> 01:26:21,843
It's time to wrap up.

2484
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:25,582
This round will determine the last winner.

2485
01:26:25,582 --> 01:26:26,853
Here comes Jeong Yeon.

2486
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:28,822
- Music, please.
- It can be anything.

2487
01:26:29,353 --> 01:26:30,452
Just dance cheerfully.

2488
01:26:32,692 --> 01:26:33,822
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2489
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,063
There goes Chae Young.

2490
01:26:35,063 --> 01:26:36,593
(I must dance.)

2491
01:26:37,162 --> 01:26:39,662
Da Hyun! Da Hyun! Hold on.

2492
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:44,603
(Momo and Da Hyun, the dance addicts, step forward.)

2493
01:26:44,603 --> 01:26:46,002
- There goes Chae Young.
- Momo!

2494
01:26:46,002 --> 01:26:48,843
- Da Hyun! Da Hyun! Hold on.
- Hey.

2495
01:26:48,843 --> 01:26:50,213
(She becomes a human fan.)

2496
01:26:50,442 --> 01:26:52,013
Come on.

2497
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:54,213
- I have to do this!
- Come on.

2498
01:26:54,213 --> 01:26:56,042
Let Chae Young dance!

2499
01:26:56,713 --> 01:26:58,912
They are unstoppable.

2500
01:26:58,912 --> 01:27:00,782
(They are in a trance.)

2501
01:27:01,452 --> 01:27:03,192
(I have to do this dance.)

2502
01:27:04,523 --> 01:27:06,723
(Momo takes over the stage.)

2503
01:27:07,662 --> 01:27:09,093
(The human fan moves her arms at 200km per second.)

2504
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:10,233
Momo.

2505
01:27:10,233 --> 01:27:11,733
Hey.

2506
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:14,963
(Da Hyun channels the spirit of a dancing ghost once more.)

2507
01:27:15,633 --> 01:27:17,933
Someone stop her!

2508
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:21,473
(No one can stop Momo and Da Hyun.)

2509
01:27:21,473 --> 01:27:22,902
Someone stop her!

2510
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:24,942
- In this round, - They are hilarious.

2511
01:27:25,143 --> 01:27:27,242
- Momo is the winner.
- They are incredible.

2512
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,912
- Momo's arms moved quickly.
- Momo.

2513
01:27:30,213 --> 01:27:31,983
You should hold them back!

2514
01:27:31,983 --> 01:27:34,053
She ran out before I could do anything.

2515
01:27:34,053 --> 01:27:35,683
- Look at that.
- Where is the manager?

2516
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:37,992
- Her arms move quickly.
- I had to dance.

2517
01:27:37,992 --> 01:27:39,822
I had to dance to that song.

2518
01:27:39,822 --> 01:27:41,963
How do your arms move so quickly? Do it again, Momo.

2519
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,023
How do they move so quickly?

2520
01:27:43,023 --> 01:27:44,633
Do you spin your arms like that?

2521
01:27:44,633 --> 01:27:45,733
How do they move so quickly?

2522
01:27:45,733 --> 01:27:48,162
It looks like Momo can't stand to lose.

2523
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:50,803
(It looks like Momo can't stand to lose.)

2524
01:27:50,803 --> 01:27:52,133
She's so serious.

2525
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,202
Da Hyun and Momo,

2526
01:27:54,242 --> 01:27:56,442
you don't win by taking the stage.

2527
01:27:56,813 --> 01:27:59,843
I want to know if Tzuyu is having fun.

2528
01:27:59,843 --> 01:28:03,213
(I want to know if Tzuyu is having fun.)

2529
01:28:04,183 --> 01:28:05,612
- Tzuyu.
- Hold on.

2530
01:28:05,612 --> 01:28:07,082
Her stomach hurts.

2531
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:08,752
Oh, is that why?

2532
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:11,593
I couldn't help minding Tzuyu.

2533
01:28:11,593 --> 01:28:13,192
Tzuyu didn't dance, did she?

2534
01:28:13,192 --> 01:28:14,192
- She didn't dance.
- She didn't dance.

2535
01:28:14,192 --> 01:28:15,662
Tzuyu, don't you regret it?

2536
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:18,332
I am not confident about dancing.

2537
01:28:18,332 --> 01:28:20,202
- You are not confident.
- Her stomach hurts.

2538
01:28:20,202 --> 01:28:23,803
- Her stomach?
- Now, we will decide on...

2539
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:25,832
the winning team.

2540
01:28:25,832 --> 01:28:28,742
The members of Running Man will vote.

2541
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:30,013
This is hard.

2542
01:28:30,213 --> 01:28:32,213
I am tallying the votes.

2543
01:28:33,213 --> 01:28:34,742
- Now...
- What is that?

2544
01:28:34,742 --> 01:28:36,013
Jae Seok, what are you doing with your fingers?

2545
01:28:36,013 --> 01:28:37,152
(Hold on.)

2546
01:28:37,152 --> 01:28:39,013
- What do you mean?
- Your fingers!

2547
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:40,582
Who has 2 votes, and who has 3 votes?

2548
01:28:40,582 --> 01:28:42,023
(You can tell the current score from his fingers.)

2549
01:28:42,023 --> 01:28:44,523
Jae Seok, what do you think you are doing?

2550
01:28:44,523 --> 01:28:46,353
- Jae Seok.
- This is...

2551
01:28:46,353 --> 01:28:47,923
The national MC shouldn't be like this.

2552
01:28:47,923 --> 01:28:49,523
The national MC should memorize the numbers.

2553
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:51,192
My fingers tally the votes automatically.

2554
01:28:51,192 --> 01:28:52,633
Can't you memorize the numbers?

2555
01:28:52,633 --> 01:28:54,433
The national MC shouldn't be like this.

2556
01:28:54,463 --> 01:28:56,002
Must you use your fingers?

2557
01:28:56,162 --> 01:28:57,532
- My goodness.
- He can't memorize the numbers.

2558
01:28:57,532 --> 01:28:59,633
My fingers tally the votes automatically.

2559
01:28:59,633 --> 01:29:02,202
- What is this?
- Momo is the winner.

2560
01:29:02,202 --> 01:29:03,942
(Momo wins.)

2561
01:29:03,942 --> 01:29:04,942
You did well.

2562
01:29:07,412 --> 01:29:09,112
(The youngest member shows her cute acts.)

2563
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:11,713
(I am cuter.)

2564
01:29:12,683 --> 01:29:14,723
(The 2nd war of cuteness breaks out.)

2565
01:29:14,923 --> 01:29:16,723
(Their greed...)

2566
01:29:16,723 --> 01:29:17,822
(knows no bounds.)

2567
01:29:17,822 --> 01:29:19,692
(They make an ordinary trip special.)

2568
01:29:20,622 --> 01:29:22,362
(1-year anniversary, my foot.)

2569
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:24,593
(How will this retreat come to an end?)

2570
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:26,162
(Finally)

2571
01:29:26,803 --> 01:29:29,832
(The Family Project faces its grand finale.)

2572
01:29:30,773 --> 01:29:35,973
(The package finally gets decided.)

2573
01:29:35,973 --> 01:29:38,213
(Secret doors are placed before them.)

2574
01:29:38,213 --> 01:29:40,483
(When the doors open, )

2575
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:43,313
(they must leave to somewhere.)

2576
01:29:43,313 --> 01:29:44,313
Please.

2577
01:29:44,452 --> 01:29:46,923
(They bet their fates on the final mission.)

2578
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,822
(If they don't stay alert, )

2579
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:51,053
(their fates will change.)

2580
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:55,463
(What lies at the end of this extraordinary trip?)

2581
01:29:55,463 --> 01:29:56,692
- 2.
- 3.

2582
01:29:57,162 --> 01:29:59,093
(Family Project Finale: Secret Doors)
