1
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:10,761
(Last week)

2
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:14,202
(It's already been a year since So Min and Se Chan joined them.)

3
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,972
(To celebrate, the members came up with their own retreat schedules.)

4
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:20,772
(However, the distribution of minutes depended purely on luck.)

5
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:24,772
(They had to carry out 6 tasks on their schedule for 365 minutes.)

6
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:29,182
(Members who give up on the tasks will get the penalty badge.)

7
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:32,982
(The member with the most badges will choose 2 members.)

8
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:37,652
(Those chosen members must sign 365 autographs to get off work.)

9
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,891
(Thus began a new retreat that you'd never seen before.)

10
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,771
(Whether you want it or not, finish the schedule within the given time.)

11
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:46,092
(After finishing 3 tasks, they began the 4th task on the schedule.)

12
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:49,302
(Twice came to congratulate So Min and Se Chan's anniversary.)

13
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:52,132
(Twice lifted the spirits of the Running Man members.)

14
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,772
- She's so sexy.
- That's amazing.

15
00:00:53,772 --> 00:00:56,671
(Twice had a dance battle against themselves to stand out.)

16
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,082
(Ji Hyo and Mom won the dance battle.)

17
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:02,482
To which members will you give the badges?

18
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:04,257
Momo, give the badges to whomever you want to give.

19
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,812
Members I want to give these to?

20
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:07,352
(The member with the most badges will choose 2 members.)

21
00:01:07,352 --> 00:01:08,982
(3 members must sign 365 autographs to get off work.)

22
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:10,352
It's bad if we get the badges.

23
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:12,822
No, no. I did my best.

24
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,391
(Don't give it to Kwang Soo.)

25
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:15,592
(However, Momo stops in front of Kwang Soo.)

26
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,891
- It can't be.
- I did my best for him.

27
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:18,891
Why...

28
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:21,001
- Kwang Soo has the most.
- It's Kwang Soo.

29
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,031
It's me?

30
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,747
(What a great choice. Momo is the best.)

31
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:26,501
- She's smart. She's smart.
- Kwang Soo has the most.

32
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:27,542
Momo is so smart.

33
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:31,542
- I really like you, Kwang Soo.
- It's bad if I get the badge.

34
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:33,281
- Good work, Kwang Soo.
- I heard this is...

35
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,781
- a good badge.
- What?

36
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:36,281
- Good job.
- Good job.

37
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:37,852
Momo, you're great.

38
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,281
- She's so good at this.
- I heard it's a good badge.

39
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:41,721
You're giving me both of the badges?

40
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:44,092
- I heard it's a great badge.
- Well done.

41
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:46,391
My gosh, I only had 1, but now, I'm in 1st place.

42
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:48,161
(He's shocked.)

43
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:51,462
- It's a token of my support.
- Thank you.

44
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:52,462
- It is.
- Great.

45
00:01:52,462 --> 00:01:55,402
A mission from the staff only remains now.

46
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:56,702
(The only remaining mission is the mission from the staff.)

47
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,872
- What? It's over soon?
- Really?

48
00:01:58,872 --> 00:02:00,202
- Seriously?
- What happened?

49
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,441
Before that, I will reveal the rest of their special talents.

50
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:05,212
It's a shame not to reveal them. Tzuyu wrote...

51
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,082
- She had 1? - 3 physical talents.

52
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:09,312
Tzuyu wrote that?

53
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,251
What are three physical talents?

54
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:15,622
First of all, I can move my ears.

55
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:16,992
- Her ears can move.
- You can move your ears.

56
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:17,992
Show us.

57
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,992
(What's the talent with her ears?)

58
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,892
Her ears are moving.

59
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:24,932
- She really did it.
- Her ears are moving.

60
00:02:24,932 --> 00:02:28,701
I'm sorry to interrupt, but can you do it without that expression?

61
00:02:28,761 --> 00:02:30,501
(Her facial expression catches their eyes more than her ears.)

62
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,902
- Stop it.
- What else can you do?

63
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,372
- It's my tongue.
- Your tongue?

64
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:36,971
- I can flip it.
- Is that so?

65
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:38,872
(She can flip her tongue? He's intrigued.)

66
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,082
(She can freely flip her tongue?)

67
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,082
She can do everything.

68
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:44,612
Not everyone can do that.

69
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,552
I can fold my tongue.

70
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:47,922
- Do it then.
- My gosh.

71
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:50,791
(What? He folded his tongue in half?)

72
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,191
Actually, that's more interesting.

73
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:54,562
(His is more interesting than Tzuyu's.)

74
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,161
- I can do this.
- What is it? Show us.

75
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,191
Look at that.

76
00:02:58,462 --> 00:02:59,691
- Look at this.
- Wait.

77
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:00,932
Mina can do it too!

78
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,201
- Mina can do this.
- I only heard about this.

79
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:05,672
- But no one can do what I did.
- What did you do?

80
00:03:05,672 --> 00:03:06,672
(Can you fold it in half?)

81
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,941
But why is this important?

82
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,312
But why is this important?

83
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,981
- I mean...
- It's great you can fold it.

84
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,612
Seriously. I mean...

85
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:19,881
How is folding your tongue useful? What is it good for?

86
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:22,682
- Think about it.
- I just wanted to show you. Gosh.

87
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:25,152
- What's the last one?
- The last talent is...

88
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,922
- bending my arm.
- I can't do that.

89
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,922
It's my arm.

90
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:29,562
Don't do it!

91
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,282
(She folds her arm twice at a right angle.)

92
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,201
You can't turn it around though.

93
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,261
(You're done already?)

94
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,231
I thought she'd turn it around.

95
00:03:37,231 --> 00:03:38,272
- Is that it?
- It's...

96
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:40,971
Yes, it looks easy, but it's hard.

97
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,372
It looks easy, but it's hard. Do you want to try it?

98
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,712
- Do you want to try? Try it.
- Hold on.

99
00:03:46,712 --> 00:03:48,582
Try it yourself. Is it easy or hard?

100
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,781
Is it hard, or is it easy? Answer me.

101
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,781
- Isn't it hard?
- That little...

102
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,321
Tell him this isn't how he should behave on shows.

103
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:57,251
(My gosh, he's embarrassing me in front of Twice.)

104
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:59,622
- How did she do that?
- It's a hard thing to do.

105
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:02,068
- Bend the arm toward the inside.
- It's very difficult.

106
00:04:02,092 --> 00:04:03,291
- Where does it go?
- Toward the inside.

107
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:04,691
My finger is just as impressive.

108
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,191
- What is that?
- What?

109
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,601
- What did you do?
- I bent my finger.

110
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,201
Hey, your finger is broken.

111
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,471
(You idiot.)

112
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,471
- Go to the hospital now.
- I broke my own finger.

113
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,601
- So what?
- He's insane.

114
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,921
- Why are you enduring the pain?
- The bones will recover.

115
00:04:18,141 --> 00:04:19,172
I can do that too.

116
00:04:19,172 --> 00:04:21,341
- What? You can? Mina can do it.
- Mina can do it.

117
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:23,381
- Hey, Chae Young can do it too.
- Wait.

118
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,381
(He's flustered.)

119
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:25,881
- Chae Young can do it.
- Hold on.

120
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,182
(Hold on a second. Let me show you.)

121
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:30,722
- Hey, Kwang Soo.
- Hey, everyone can do it.

122
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:31,922
- Everyone can do it.
- Mine goes as low as this.

123
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:32,992
(I can do it too.)

124
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:34,821
- Everyone can do it.
- Everyone can do it.

125
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,191
(The battle of special talents with Twice finishes.)

126
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,432
Anyway, please give out...

127
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:44,771
- 2 penalty badges.
- Let's count the badges 1st.

128
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,641
If you have four badges, raise your hand.

129
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:48,802
- I have four.
- Step forward, and speak.

130
00:04:48,802 --> 00:04:50,972
- Yes, sir. I have four!
- There you go. Great.

131
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:51,972
(He's well-disciplined.)

132
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:52,972
(He doesn't want the badge.)

133
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:54,158
- Go back to your spot.
- Yes, sir.

134
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:55,812
All right. Three badges.

135
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:58,812
- Yes, sir. I have three.
- Great.

136
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:00,151
Hey, you. How many do you have?

137
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:01,381
I have five, sir!

138
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,081
(He overdoes it.)

139
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:06,891
Okay. The rest of you don't have badges, right?

140
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,722
- Tzuyu will choose one...
- Okay.

141
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:12,131
- Of the three and give this badge.
- Thank you, Tzuyu.

142
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,162
If Jae Seok gets another one,

143
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,802
- He and I will both have five.
- My gosh.

144
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:17,131
- Ms. Tzuyu.
- Hello.

145
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,501
I've been rooting for... Hold on. Listen to me.

146
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:20,501
(She says hello to Seok Jin...)

147
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:22,341
(and goes straight to Kwang Soo.)

148
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:23,341
Please listen to me.

149
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:26,211
I'm in last. If I get another, I'll still be last.

150
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:27,841
- I see.
- And besides, I thought...

151
00:05:28,282 --> 00:05:29,282
(Tzuyu isn't affected.)

152
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:30,651
- Are you sure?
- Please accept the badge.

153
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,782
I'll take 1. I'll take 1 for now.

154
00:05:32,782 --> 00:05:34,521
- Congratulations.
- It's a gift. Accept it.

155
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,622
- Congratulations.
- It's from Tzuyu.

156
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:37,328
- Why is it me?
- How could you turn it down?

157
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,352
Why are you giving it to me?

158
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:40,792
- Why?
- I just wanted to give you one.

159
00:05:41,662 --> 00:05:43,261
- You have 1 left.
- 1...

160
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,131
- My gosh.
- Why didn't you give that to him?

161
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,831
- You can give it to him.
- Okay.

162
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,432
My gosh, you didn't have to give me one.

163
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:53,242
I had so much fun at your radio show the other day.

164
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,172
(Since it was fun, she gives him the badge?)

165
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:58,742
You were supposed to give one to someone you don't like.

166
00:05:58,742 --> 00:06:01,011
- That was great.
- Thank you, Tzuyu.

167
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,242
- Thank you.
- Well done.

168
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:04,651
- Thank you, Mr. Jong Kook.
- Sure, sure. My gosh, Tzuyu.

169
00:06:05,711 --> 00:06:09,422
Thank you so much for joining us today, Twice.

170
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:10,992
I hope you will join us again.

171
00:06:10,992 --> 00:06:12,821
- Seriously. It was too short.
- It was too short.

172
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,821
- Let's give it up for Twice again.
- Thank you.

173
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,562
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

174
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,062
- Thank you.
- Well done.

175
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,302
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

176
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,208
(The cutthroat battle to get off work begins now.)

177
00:06:22,232 --> 00:06:23,771
We have two more left.

178
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,701
- We have 1 slot for 30 minutes.
- We have the misty time.

179
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,372
We have 2 slots for 30 minutes.

180
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,452
It will be a disaster to pick foot volleyball again.

181
00:06:30,571 --> 00:06:32,071
I want to use the restroom.

182
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,441
- It's an option.
- I want to use the restroom.

183
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,081
Please, please.

184
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:39,081
- Please.
- It could be...

185
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:40,482
Restroom break!

186
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,052
- Okay.
- Restroom break.

187
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,451
- Number 1. Yellow, number 1.
- Yellow, number 1?

188
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,992
(Yellow, number 1)

189
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:49,122
"Remaining Silent".

190
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,662
- Really?
- "Remaining Silent".

191
00:06:50,662 --> 00:06:52,232
- "Remaining Silent".
- Can we do that?

192
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:54,102
- That's harder.
- Can we do that?

193
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,872
You have to do absolutely nothing and remain silent.

194
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,341
(We can't do anything?)

195
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,641
I don't want that.

196
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,571
- This is too much.
- Seriously.

197
00:07:03,571 --> 00:07:06,011
Doing nothing for 30 minutes will make us go crazy.

198
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,482
You will be fine as long as you stay silent.

199
00:07:07,482 --> 00:07:09,581
- We have to stay silent.
- What can we do silently?

200
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:11,451
(Can they remain silent?)

201
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,052
This is...

202
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:15,451
Do we remain silent?

203
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:16,992
Can we sleep?

204
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,328
Yes, you can, but you will get the penalty as soon as you snore.

205
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:20,922
- We must remain silent.
- We must remain silent.

206
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,292
You must remain silent.

207
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:23,891
I don't remain silent for 30 minutes...

208
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,732
- even when I am at home.
- 30 minutes is too long.

209
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,461
- Get ready.
- We must remain silent.

210
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,102
Set.

211
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,071
(Remaining Silent for 30 minutes begins.)

212
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:37,341
(I have a lot of badges.)

213
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,612
(Do you want to carry out the penalty with me?)

214
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:44,812
(Stepping)

215
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:48,381
(Se Chan steps on his foot.)

216
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,422
(Why does everyone pick on me?)

217
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:54,691
(As Se Chan and Kwang Soo cause a scene, )

218
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,591
(Haha leaves to remain unscathed.)

219
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:01,261
(I am leaving as well.)

220
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:04,872
(Don't you dare try anything with me.)

221
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:06,742
(Se Chan looks something up.)

222
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,602
(Look at this.)

223
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:15,042
(He almost bursts out laughing.)

224
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:19,251
(It's Kwang Soo's look-alike, Han Gi Beom.)

225
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:22,081
(They laugh silently.)

226
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,222
(Rustling)

227
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,492
(Chuckling)

228
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,631
(Kwang Soo gets the penalty for making a sound.)

229
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,162
(Jae Seok calls him.)

230
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:37,677
Is it within the rules to call someone?

231
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:38,831
Why did you call me?

232
00:08:39,172 --> 00:08:41,042
Hold on. Fine.

233
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,502
Let's do this.

234
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,111
Let's do this.

235
00:08:44,111 --> 00:08:45,441
(Good bye, Kwang Soo.)

236
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,882
(What's the Hidden Penalty of this mission?)

237
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,611
Okay, okay. Okay.

238
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:56,792
(The penalty involves flogging.)

239
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,792
(The oak flogging instrument is fast and efficient.)

240
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:01,121
What is this?

241
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:03,162
This is wrong.

242
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:05,731
Dong Geun, you...

243
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,861
(Na Dong Geun is a veteran staff member...)

244
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,201
(who is known to deliver strong blows.)

245
00:09:08,201 --> 00:09:09,331
Get someone else!

246
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,632
Get someone else!

247
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,831
Get someone else!

248
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,077
(The angle of his elbow shows that he is on a different class.)

249
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:17,711
(Hitting)

250
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:19,882
Hold on. Girls, leave!

251
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,741
(Twice is leaving.)

252
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,752
Don't look at me!

253
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:26,211
Girls!

254
00:09:26,552 --> 00:09:27,658
Thank you for your hard work!

255
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:28,752
Bye!

256
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:30,451
Don't look at me!

257
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,522
(I am not always like this.)

258
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,922
Don't look at me.

259
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:35,321
(Turn your eyes away from me.)

260
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,461
(He is flooded with a sense of shame.)

261
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:41,731
(I am okay!)

262
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,432
(Kwang Soo is screaming.)

263
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,642
(What's the penalty?)

264
00:09:48,902 --> 00:09:50,812
(Seok Jin, look at this.)

265
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:56,441
(Ji Hyo attacks with a picture of a young Seok Jin.)

266
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:59,782
(Seok Jin, look at this.)

267
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:04,052
(Jae Seok attacks with a picture of Sae Ho's look-alike.)

268
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,821
(Seok Jin staggers due to 2 consecutive attacks.)

269
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,361
(Laughing)

270
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:15,762
(Haha's bare face knocks him out.)

271
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:19,941
I got three consecutive attacks.

272
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,601
(I need to hold back.)

273
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,071
(Seok Jin receives a penalty badge and leaves to get flogged.)

274
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:28,382
(Kwang Soo, come over here.)

275
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,851
(Jae Seok hurriedly calls Kwang Soo over.)

276
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:35,951
(I want to study law at Seoul National University.)

277
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,422
(He can't control his laughter.)

278
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,898
(Kwang Soo gets knocked out by Jong Kook during his Turbo days.)

279
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:42,091
It's impossible not to laugh at this.

280
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,292
(This is driving me crazy.)

281
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,162
(Jae Seok tries to show it to Se Chan as well.)

282
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:52,831
(Se Chan strikes with a picture of himself.)

283
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:55,542
(Laughing)

284
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,312
(The shocking picture sends Jae Seok to the flogging instrument.)

285
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:00,711
Hey!

286
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:03,012
I have that picture, too.

287
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:05,111
(Why does he have that picture?)

288
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:06,552
This is driving me crazy.

289
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:12,292
(He attacks with a picture of Sae Ho in his early days.)

290
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,422
(She is about to collapse.)

291
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:18,292
(Remaining Silent turns into a battle of shocking pictures.)

292
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,361
(Jong Kook begins to attack.)

293
00:11:21,032 --> 00:11:24,902
(Han Gi Beom, the basketball player, makes another appearance.)

294
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:31,571
(They are nearing their limits.)

295
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,042
(Jae Seok gets a penalty thanks to Se Chan's counterattack.)

296
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,682
(He gets flogged.)

297
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,282
(It's payback time.)

298
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,422
(He gets a penalty badge.)

299
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:51,062
(Everyone is absorbed in looking up funny pictures.)

300
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,071
(My goodness.)

301
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,802
(He performs acupuncture on Seok Jin.)

302
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:02,642
(Seok Jin gets a penalty for making a sound.)

303
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,071
(I can't believe you pricked me.)

304
00:12:05,071 --> 00:12:06,142
Okay.

305
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,512
(Jae Seok's acupuncture brings energy back to Seok Jin.)

306
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:14,022
(He now approaches Kwang Soo who is clueless.)

307
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:17,451
(Jae Seok, look at this.)

308
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,562
(Yelling)

309
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,792
(What is this?)

310
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:27,361
(Kwang Soo gets energy back, too.)

311
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,861
Fine. Just fine.

312
00:12:29,932 --> 00:12:31,071
Fine.

313
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,341
I decided on my path now.

314
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:37,571
(He takes the familiar path toward the flogging instrument.)

315
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,672
Okay.

316
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:42,241
(He lies on his stomach without being told.)

317
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:43,752
(What?)

318
00:12:43,752 --> 00:12:46,282
(Is that Yoon Sang, the cameraman?)

319
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:51,451
(Screaming)

320
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,321
(Why are you doing this?)

321
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:58,091
(Kwang Soo's cameraman, who suffered the penalties with him, pays back.)

322
00:12:58,091 --> 00:13:00,961
(Kwang Soo, let's stop receiving penalties.)

323
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:03,402
Okay.

324
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:04,502
Okay, okay.

325
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:05,672
(As he continues to say okay, )

326
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:08,302
(his eyes become unfocused.)

327
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:10,912
(He is angry at the members and the staff.)

328
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,341
(Haha beckons Jae Seok.)

329
00:13:14,581 --> 00:13:17,382
(Jae Seok ends up looking out of curiosity.)

330
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:22,321
(He shows a picture of Jae Seok's doppelganger.)

331
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,652
(They almost stop breathing.)

332
00:13:24,922 --> 00:13:28,162
(Laughing)

333
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:32,331
(A Japanese vet who resembles Jae Seok has lethal charms.)

334
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,132
You have 10 minutes left.

335
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:38,571
(The funny picture contest is at a standstill.)

336
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:42,441
(Rumbling)

337
00:13:44,941 --> 00:13:46,882
(Rumbling)

338
00:13:47,382 --> 00:13:50,652
(So Min's stomach is making a noise!)

339
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,451
It was my stomach!

340
00:13:53,451 --> 00:13:55,481
This shouldn't count!

341
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:58,892
My stomach rumbled!

342
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,121
This shouldn't count!

343
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:01,892
This shouldn't count!

344
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:05,191
Okay. Se Chan, I will get you.

345
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,802
I will get you.

346
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:08,062
This is your fault.

347
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:14,172
(Noisy)

348
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:18,312
(The members see something and burst out laughing.)

349
00:14:21,081 --> 00:14:24,111
(So Min brings a weapon.)

350
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,481
(Se Chan, you deserve a beating.)

351
00:14:28,152 --> 00:14:29,821
(Look at that.)

352
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:33,621
(What? A vacuum cleaner?)

353
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,861
(Hitting)

354
00:14:37,191 --> 00:14:39,662
(Okay, let's do this.)

355
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,971
(Thor with a paddle versus Iron Man with a vacuum cleaner)

356
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:47,042
(What is Kwang Soo trying to do?)

357
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,441
(He is working hard.)

358
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:52,012
(Jae Seok runs over to the vacuum cleaner.)

359
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,111
(Where is the power button?)

360
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,981
(Pressing)

361
00:14:57,282 --> 00:14:58,611
(Groaning)

362
00:15:00,422 --> 00:15:03,591
(He vacuums Kwang Soo, a big piece of dust.)

363
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,591
(My goodness.)

364
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,762
(Hit him with this.)

365
00:15:09,932 --> 00:15:11,091
Fine.

366
00:15:11,662 --> 00:15:12,831
I know what to do.

367
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,361
I know what to do.

368
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:16,502
(I hope this ends soon.)

369
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:19,331
(They have 5 minutes left.)

370
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:21,672
(Please get him.)

371
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,711
(Jae Seok?)

372
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:27,111
(May I borrow the vacuum cleaner?)

373
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,081
(Anxious)

374
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,922
(When Jae Seok doesn't listen, the members gather.)

375
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,392
(Let's get him.)

376
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:40,522
(The committee for Jae Seok's penalty begins.)

377
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,792
(He gets a mouth massage...)

378
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:48,002
(as well as an eardrum massage.)

379
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,672
(Don't do this at home.)

380
00:15:52,502 --> 00:15:55,302
(They realize how precious laughter is.)

381
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:57,341
You almost ruined my cochlea.

382
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:58,371
(He gets dragged away.)

383
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,941
My ear... For goodness' sake.

384
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,642
I can't believe Se Chan.

385
00:16:02,642 --> 00:16:05,312
(Se Chan is a man who can make anyone talk.)

386
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,121
(Peace comes right before the session ends.)

387
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,762
(Farting)

388
00:16:14,121 --> 00:16:15,961
(I am sure you heard it.)

389
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:18,032
(He farts while he is walking.)

390
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,201
(He throws in a fart at the end.)

391
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,371
(He is incredibly embarrassed.)

392
00:16:23,632 --> 00:16:26,371
(A Running Man member farts in front of the viewers.)

393
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:29,971
(The person who farted gets arrested at the corner.)

394
00:16:30,971 --> 00:16:32,512
(It's impossible to deny it.)

395
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,581
Hey.

396
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,851
It's because you made me nervous.

397
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:40,481
(He farted at the moment of silence.)

398
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:44,451
(Kwang Soo is used to being flogged by now.)

399
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:47,792
(How do I take revenge?)

400
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:51,262
(He picks something up.)

401
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,231
(Is it a fistful of dirt?)

402
00:16:55,002 --> 00:16:57,371
(It was Se Chan and Jae Seok's fault.)

403
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,571
(Se Chan has no idea what's about to happen.)

404
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:03,611
(I'm so glad to see you.)

405
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:08,042
(Kwang Soo corners Se Chan with a fistful of dirt.)

406
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,552
(He explodes in laughter.)

407
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,081
(Kwang Soo gasps for air.)

408
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:17,821
(Coughing)

409
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,722
(What's going on?)

410
00:17:20,462 --> 00:17:21,762
(Kwang Soo hoped to take revenge.)

411
00:17:21,762 --> 00:17:24,161
(Is he giving up after drinking water?)

412
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:26,562
(Kwang Soo isn't coming back home.)

413
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,262
(Se Chan cleans up quietly.)

414
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,802
- You go first.
- No.

415
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:32,431
You go first, Jae Seok.

416
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:34,571
What's in your pockets?

417
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,802
(So Min gets ready.)

418
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,341
My goodness!

419
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,171
There isn't much in them.

420
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:41,942
(She hits him on his lower back.)

421
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,312
Jae Seok, weren't they your buttocks?

422
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,121
I thought they were.

423
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,891
Were they your buttocks? I'm sorry.

424
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:53,692
I hit you on the buttocks, right?

425
00:17:54,262 --> 00:17:55,762
He doesn't have fat on his buttocks.

426
00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,692
(That hurt.)

427
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:01,831
(His buttocks are numb.)

428
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:05,032
(They take turns flogging each other.)

429
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,202
(Get off of it.)

430
00:18:09,202 --> 00:18:11,611
Get off of it. Promise me that you won't hit me.

431
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,671
- Okay.
- Leave.

432
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:13,982
- Leave now.
- Leave.

433
00:18:14,841 --> 00:18:16,012
Hurry and leave.

434
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,351
My goodness.

435
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:22,151
(She slowly turns around.)

436
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,091
(She notices them.)

437
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,722
Hurry and leave, Kwang Soo.

438
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,821
(He's being suspicious.)

439
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,462
(He heads to the room.)

440
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:32,462
(He quickly turns right.)

441
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:33,931
Go in.

442
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,931
Kwang Soo, what's wrong with you?

443
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,002
It's going to hurt.

444
00:18:39,371 --> 00:18:40,972
It'll hurt.

445
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:42,772
Seriously.

446
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,641
I really won't hit you.

447
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,812
- Come on.
- I won't hit you.

448
00:18:45,972 --> 00:18:48,242
- Stop lying.
- I won't hit.

449
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:49,982
- You'll throw it.
- No, I won't.

450
00:18:49,982 --> 00:18:52,212
- You'll jump off.
- No, I can't jump off from here.

451
00:18:52,212 --> 00:18:54,181
- Stop lying.
- I really won't.

452
00:18:54,952 --> 00:18:56,351
Please.

453
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:59,321
You can't do this. This isn't how you play it.

454
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,591
Lie down.

455
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,861
- Lie down properly.
- This isn't how you play the game.

456
00:19:03,262 --> 00:19:04,631
Stop it.

457
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,631
Hey, hey.

458
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,032
(Screaming)

459
00:19:11,202 --> 00:19:12,772
(He jumps off and flogs her.)

460
00:19:13,502 --> 00:19:15,571
(He asks for forgiveness immediately.)

461
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,571
I'm sorry.

462
00:19:17,871 --> 00:19:20,141
I didn't know that it'd be that hard.

463
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:23,141
If I get the penalty, I'll choose you.

464
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:26,052
- I'll pick you.
- Let's see who loses.

465
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,081
(Let's see who loses.)

466
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,252
I'm sorry.

467
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,292
(Remaining silent for 30 minutes is being chaotic.)

468
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,492
You have one minute left.

469
00:19:34,391 --> 00:19:37,091
(1 minute is easy.)

470
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:38,861
(Let's stay quiet.)

471
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:42,431
(They have 1 minute before they're free.)

472
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:46,002
(The game isn't over yet.)

473
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,002
(Pressing hard)

474
00:19:51,371 --> 00:19:54,341
(His attacks are the best.)

475
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:56,712
Goodness.

476
00:19:56,712 --> 00:19:58,982
(Jae Seok gets another penalty badge.)

477
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,482
(Darn it.)

478
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:03,391
Hey!

479
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:06,591
You almost broke my legs.

480
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:10,532
(You'll feel better after some flogging.)

481
00:20:10,762 --> 00:20:13,532
(Shall we stay quiet now?)

482
00:20:15,401 --> 00:20:18,331
(30 minutes of Remaining Silent are over.)

483
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,502
- That was difficult.
- The time is up.

484
00:20:21,502 --> 00:20:23,341
- The time is up.
- Goodness.

485
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,141
You're really good, Se Chan.

486
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,381
- Se Chan is such a cheater.
- What's this?

487
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:28,841
He brought me dirt.

488
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:31,982
- What were you going to use it for?
- Did you bring the dirt?

489
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,222
I wanted to throw it at his eyes.

490
00:20:33,222 --> 00:20:34,252
(He's so simple.)

491
00:20:35,482 --> 00:20:38,292
- Were you going to throw it at me?
- You mean these rocks?

492
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:39,962
- It's dirt.
- It's not even dirt.

493
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:42,198
- I wanted to sprinkle on his eyes.
- He hit me, and it hurts.

494
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,962
These are rocks.

495
00:20:43,962 --> 00:20:46,091
Thank goodness that he drank water.

496
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:48,962
Here's the last thing on your schedule.

497
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:50,871
- It isn't over yet.
- It's a 35-minute...

498
00:20:50,871 --> 00:20:52,502
session.

499
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,871
- What is it?
- Is someone coming?

500
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,542
(It's a 35-minute session.)

501
00:20:56,202 --> 00:21:00,411
(It's Misty Time 2.)

502
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:02,381
(What kind of activity will it be this time?)

503
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:04,482
That's enough. Let us go home.

504
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:07,222
(I don't care. Just let us go home.)

505
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:09,022
- Let us go out.
- Seriously.

506
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:11,952
Except when Twice came on the show,

507
00:21:11,952 --> 00:21:13,421
it wasn't fun at all today.

508
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,821
(You enjoyed foot volleyball.)

509
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,192
The last session on 365 Retreat is...

510
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:19,562
Rolling Paper.

511
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:21,732
(Rolling Paper)

512
00:21:22,202 --> 00:21:24,401
(Is it Rolling Paper for us?)

513
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:25,401
What?

514
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,101
Just give me paper for signing.

515
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:30,472
(He's going to lose anyway.)

516
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:32,871
It applies to six members except Se Chan and So Min.

517
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:35,381
Write anything you'd like to say to Se Chan and So Min...

518
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,282
on the rolling paper.

519
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:39,581
Write over 10 lines.

520
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:41,452
- "10 lines"?
- I like this.

521
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:42,681
- I like this.
- It sounds fun.

522
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:44,151
While they write,

523
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:46,252
So Min and Se Chan will wait outside.

524
00:21:46,252 --> 00:21:48,321
- Really?
- It's so heart-warming.

525
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:50,091
Let's go, So Min.

526
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:52,262
(Feeling moved, the youngest members leave hand in hand.)

527
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:53,562
- Se Chan.
- Let's go.

528
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:57,071
(Feeling moved, the youngest members leave hand in hand.)

529
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:58,972
(What's this?)

530
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:00,141
What's this?

531
00:22:00,472 --> 00:22:01,671
Is there another mission?

532
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:03,071
What are we doing?

533
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,512
(Each of them gets 6 notebooks and a pen.)

534
00:22:06,272 --> 00:22:09,512
(Are they also given a mission?)

535
00:22:10,212 --> 00:22:12,252
(Meanwhile, inside...)

536
00:22:12,351 --> 00:22:17,091
(they write how they sincerely feel.)

537
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,562
I don't usually write these, so it's hard.

538
00:22:22,562 --> 00:22:23,591
Isn't it hard?

539
00:22:24,232 --> 00:22:26,931
(How is everyone writing it?)

540
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:28,532
- Gosh.
- Give me one more piece.

541
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:31,272
(Seok Jin asks for more paper.)

542
00:22:31,272 --> 00:22:33,542
What? What's going on with you?

543
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:36,542
Suddenly, I have a lot to write.

544
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,542
I'm getting emotional.

545
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:40,262
(It's embarrassing, but he gets emotional.)

546
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:43,141
(Six members finish the Rolling Paper.)

547
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:44,982
Why is it making me nervous?

548
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:47,851
- They look...
- They don't look happy.

549
00:22:48,052 --> 00:22:49,522
Did you write well?

550
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:51,452
- No.
- We wrote well.

551
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:52,591
We wrote sincerely.

552
00:22:52,591 --> 00:22:54,722
You should have written sincerely.

553
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:57,091
- What?
- Have a seat first.

554
00:22:57,091 --> 00:22:58,331
(Is there something?)

555
00:22:58,331 --> 00:23:00,032
(You'll see.)

556
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:02,502
The last is...

557
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,272
Dangerous Rolling Paper.

558
00:23:04,272 --> 00:23:06,331
(Dangerous Rolling Paper)

559
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:08,341
What? Dangerous?

560
00:23:08,802 --> 00:23:09,841
What is it?

561
00:23:09,841 --> 00:23:12,111
While you were writing on rolling paper,

562
00:23:12,111 --> 00:23:13,681
So Min and Se Chan...

563
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,341
guessed a word...

564
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,611
- that you'd use the most.
- What?

565
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:20,252
- Goodness.
- What kind of game is this?

566
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,851
(Few minutes ago)

567
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:27,292
(Se Chan and So Min predict a word that was used the most.)

568
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:29,022
(Haha probably wrote about farting.)

569
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,732
He'll definitely mention it.

570
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,762
(They guess a word per member.)

571
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:35,062
That was it. I shouldn't have written it twice.

572
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:36,671
I shouldn't have written names.

573
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,331
So Min and Se Chan will read your rolling papers.

574
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,502
Each time their predicted word is said,

575
00:23:41,502 --> 00:23:44,062
water will fall on the member and a penalty badge will be given.

576
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:45,972
If there is no predicted word,

577
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:47,942
So Min and Se Chan will get the water bomb...

578
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:49,242
and a penalty badge.

579
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,351
While we were writing,

580
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:53,351
- we thought about it a lot.
- Right.

581
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:55,522
- I'll definitely be the first.
- The first rolling paper is...

582
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:56,692
written by Jong Kook.

583
00:23:56,821 --> 00:23:58,091
- It's Jong Kook.
- I'm sure I wrote it.

584
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,692
So Min and Se Chan...

585
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:02,821
will announce the words they predicted for Jong Kook.

586
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:04,431
Don't look, Jong Kook.

587
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:06,361
For whom are we playing?

588
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,502
Can we look?

589
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:11,071
- What?
- He uses them often.

590
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,841
Now, read his rolling paper.

591
00:24:15,841 --> 00:24:19,341
I'd like to hear "One Man" as I read it.

592
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,512
(He sings right away.)

593
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:24,282
The staff will play it later.

594
00:24:24,282 --> 00:24:25,752
(You don't have to sing.)

595
00:24:25,952 --> 00:24:28,681
They'll play it, so be quiet.

596
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:31,952
(So Min loves his singing.)

597
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:36,321
"Se Chan and So Min, a year has passed by already."

598
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:40,831
"It feels like yesterday when you gave me a water bomb in a trailer."

599
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:48,972
(The newcomers gave him a water bomb.)

600
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:52,772
"I'm glad that things have gone well so far."

601
00:24:53,212 --> 00:24:57,651
"I know joining an old variety show gave you a lot of pressure."

602
00:24:57,851 --> 00:25:00,321
"However, you adjusted yourselves without losing confidence."

603
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,952
"You do your best to make the audience laugh."

604
00:25:03,591 --> 00:25:06,052
"I'm grateful and apologetic at the same time."

605
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:11,062
"I'll work harder to become a better friend to you."

606
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:13,802
"From Jong Kook".

607
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:17,901
"From Jong Kook".

608
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:19,171
Is that it?

609
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:22,302
- There were no words that applied.
- Really?

610
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:26,141
(Both of their predicted words weren't written.)

611
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,812
(Why didn't he write our words?)

612
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:31,111
- It was also moving.
- That's amazing.

613
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,312
He didn't get penalized.

614
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:36,022
You use those words quite often. You could have written them.

615
00:25:36,282 --> 00:25:37,552
Is it that much?

616
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:38,921
(That's so much water.)

617
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:44,062
(Se Chan and So Min get wet and receive penalty badges.)

618
00:25:44,732 --> 00:25:47,161
(This isn't a joke.)

619
00:25:47,861 --> 00:25:50,502
Se Chan's word was "punk", and So Min's word was "time".

620
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,302
I didn't write "time"?

621
00:25:52,571 --> 00:25:54,302
Didn't I say, "for a long time"?

622
00:25:54,401 --> 00:25:56,071
Didn't I write it?

623
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,772
I thought he would start by saying,

624
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,841
"That's right, you punk."

625
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:02,641
- All right.
- I won't get a pass.

626
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:05,081
- Is it Ji Hyo's letter?
- Water falls when the word is said.

627
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,312
("Always" and "1 year")

628
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:08,552
(So Min predicts "always", Se Chan predicts "1 year".)

629
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:09,752
That's smart thinking.

630
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:11,952
(Se Chan was smart.)

631
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:13,361
- That's smart thinking.
- She definitely wrote that.

632
00:26:13,361 --> 00:26:14,621
I'm sure she wrote it.

633
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:17,032
- That's...
- I should move away a little.

634
00:26:17,032 --> 00:26:18,232
Me too.

635
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:21,532
I didn't bring any extra underwear.

636
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:23,202
I can lend you mine.

637
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:24,571
(He has a lot of underwear.)

638
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,972
- Lend me one.
- Kwang Soo has small buttocks,

639
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:29,242
- so it'll fit.
- I have an XS size too.

640
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:30,542
Why?

641
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,341
Just in case.

642
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,141
(Just in case?)

643
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:36,672
All right. Please read the letter.

644
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,252
Okay. It's Ji Hyo's letter.

645
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:41,552
Judging from So Min's face, I think I wrote the words.

646
00:26:42,052 --> 00:26:43,052
No.

647
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:47,722
"So Min and Se Chan, it's already been a year."

648
00:26:48,321 --> 00:26:50,131
- Oh, my.
- From the beginning...

649
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:51,131
(1 year)

650
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:56,462
(Ji Hyo is splashed with water and receives a penalty badge.)

651
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:58,532
It's starting.

652
00:26:58,532 --> 00:26:59,841
Oh, my.

653
00:26:59,841 --> 00:27:03,042
- I shouldn't be sitting nearby.
- I feel uncomfortable.

654
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:05,341
- I saw through Ji Hyo.
- Really?

655
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,782
"I remember what you said..."

656
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:10,252
"on our Mongolia trip."

657
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:13,621
"You said you wanted to run away from the cameras."

658
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:16,651
- Will the guys get angry with us...
- They will.

659
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,692
If we buy these?

660
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:18,992
(1 year ago, the two of them went on a penalty trip to Mongolia.)

661
00:27:18,992 --> 00:27:20,062
We'll get in trouble.

662
00:27:20,062 --> 00:27:21,297
(1 year ago, the two of them went on a penalty trip to Mongolia.)

663
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,621
You're very positive.

664
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:24,361
(So Min opened up to Ji Hyo.)

665
00:27:24,431 --> 00:27:27,401
(I'm pessimistic.)

666
00:27:27,732 --> 00:27:29,762
(Variety shows are hard for me. Sometimes, I want to run away.)

667
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:32,272
"You must have had a lot of worries."

668
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:35,871
"But you've managed to give new energy..."

669
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,212
"to our show. So Min and Se Chan,"

670
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,782
"I'd like to thank you guys again. From Ji Hyo."

671
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:42,712
(I'd like to thank you guys again, Se Chan and So Min.)

672
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,611
(Touched)

673
00:27:44,911 --> 00:27:46,252
Well...

674
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:47,621
The other word didn't appear.

675
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:50,421
I haven't guessed a word right.

676
00:27:50,591 --> 00:27:52,591
- So Min will be splashed again.
- Again?

677
00:27:52,591 --> 00:27:54,421
So Min is catching up.

678
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:57,962
I never seem to escape penalties.

679
00:27:57,962 --> 00:28:00,702
(Instead of being moved to tears, she gets splashed with water.)

680
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:04,131
But So Min, you must be so touched.

681
00:28:04,131 --> 00:28:05,502
(Teasing)

682
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:07,702
- You haven't guessed 1 word.
- I want to guess at least 1 word.

683
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:09,401
Among so many words...

684
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,242
Let's read Haha's letter.

685
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,712
You have to splash so much water?

686
00:28:13,841 --> 00:28:16,042
Oh, my.

687
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,351
(Fart, "Ya man")

688
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,151
(These words will definitely be in the letter.)

689
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,561
They'll definitely be in the letter.

690
00:28:22,651 --> 00:28:24,522
- Hold on.
- Definitely.

691
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,621
Of course.

692
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,591
They'll probably be in the letter.

693
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,331
- Definitely.
- I'd be surprised...

694
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,591
if they're not.

695
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,002
- Please read the letter.
- I'll read it.

696
00:28:35,702 --> 00:28:37,601
"To So Min and Se Chan."

697
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:40,641
"You brought good luck to our show."

698
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:43,212
"And I learn a lot from you guys."

699
00:28:43,641 --> 00:28:46,742
"You guys always work so hard."

700
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,012
"When So Min won the Best Rookie Award,"

701
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,752
"Se Chan was genuinely happy for her."

702
00:28:52,952 --> 00:28:54,222
"It moved me."

703
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:56,891
"Your friendship is beautiful."

704
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,241
"But when Se Chan got drunk, he did say that..."

705
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:02,121
"he was very upset."

706
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:04,732
(Se Chan said he was upset.)

707
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:06,232
"He thought it was unfair..."

708
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:09,011
"and wanted to make a scene at the awards ceremony."

709
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:13,071
"He wanted to be popular."

710
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:15,302
"He wanted to be a star."

711
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:17,712
"He did say that."

712
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:21,841
"So Min, I heard you passing gas during the shooting."

713
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:24,482
(I heard you passing gas.)

714
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:25,782
"But I didn't say anything."

715
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:27,821
- I didn't.
- "From Haha."

716
00:29:28,151 --> 00:29:29,351
I passed.

717
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,591
- He passed.
- No "ya man"?

718
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:33,022
Haha passed.

719
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,192
Unbelievable.

720
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:37,292
That was close.

721
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,631
- Why...
- Why didn't you add "ya man"?

722
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:41,931
I had no space left.

723
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:44,131
Why...

724
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:46,101
So Min and Se Chan will be splashed with water.

725
00:29:46,101 --> 00:29:48,442
"Ya man"!

726
00:29:48,442 --> 00:29:49,702
- "Ya man".
- "Ya man".

727
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:53,641
(Se Chan and So Min get another penalty badge.)

728
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:54,782
Gosh.

729
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:57,181
- Now, no one knows.
- No one knows.

730
00:29:57,252 --> 00:30:00,722
Why am I bad at not only games but this too?

731
00:30:00,722 --> 00:30:02,752
What am I good at?

732
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,851
So Min...

733
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:05,752
- "1 year"...
- There was no "1 year".

734
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:07,492
- I didn't write, "one year".
- So Min.

735
00:30:07,492 --> 00:30:09,321
(So Min failed to guess what Seok Jin wrote too.)

736
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,732
It's cold!

737
00:30:10,732 --> 00:30:12,091
(Surprisingly...)

738
00:30:12,091 --> 00:30:13,302
You're not good at this.

739
00:30:13,302 --> 00:30:14,931
So Min is getting ahead.

740
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:17,272
I haven't guessed one word.

741
00:30:17,571 --> 00:30:18,601
Let's see.

742
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,571
(Jeon Clumsy, Cheater)

743
00:30:22,671 --> 00:30:24,972
My guess is that they'll appear about three times.

744
00:30:24,972 --> 00:30:26,841
- I'm not sure.
- You think so?

745
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:28,542
Let's start.

746
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:29,952
"To Se Chan and So Min."

747
00:30:30,552 --> 00:30:31,782
(To Se Chan and So Min)

748
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:34,552
"It's already been a year since you guys joined."

749
00:30:35,151 --> 00:30:38,492
"Se Chan, I'm so happy to have you on our show."

750
00:30:38,952 --> 00:30:43,661
"Thanks to you, I don't even look in the mirror before shooting."

751
00:30:43,661 --> 00:30:45,661
(What?)

752
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,962
- "I also throw whatever clothes..."
- That...

753
00:30:48,962 --> 00:30:51,472
- doesn't make sense.
- He's going to get the penalty.

754
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:53,242
I knew it.

755
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:56,671
"You gave me such confidence."

756
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,542
(Thank you for your extraordinary looks.)

757
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,641
"Thank you so much, Se Chan."

758
00:31:01,411 --> 00:31:03,611
- "I'd like to thank Kwang Soo too."
- Why me?

759
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,681
(Why me?)

760
00:31:04,681 --> 00:31:07,252
I feel so grateful to Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

761
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:10,552
(Thank you for your interesting looks.)

762
00:31:10,891 --> 00:31:12,992
"So Min,"

763
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:16,992
"we always get penalized together. You're just as unlucky as I am."

764
00:31:17,091 --> 00:31:21,562
"Thanks to you, I'm not as afraid of penalties anymore."

765
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:25,202
"So Min, let's work hard from now on too..."

766
00:31:25,202 --> 00:31:27,901
"and do our best to make our viewers laugh."

767
00:31:27,942 --> 00:31:30,571
"So Min and Se Chan, thank you for being with us."

768
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:33,141
"Long live Se Chan and So Min."

769
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,542
What's that?

770
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:37,512
- "Yu Clumsy".
- "Yu Clumsy".

771
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:40,252
Gosh. I wrote, "Jeon Clumsy".

772
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:41,252
(He didn't write the words.)

773
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,722
He didn't write those words?

774
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:44,222
- "Jeon Clumsy" and "Cheater".
- "Jeon Clumsy" and "Cheater".

775
00:31:44,222 --> 00:31:46,192
- He didn't write them?
- He wrote, "Yu Clumsy".

776
00:31:46,222 --> 00:31:47,562
- How is it possible?
- I didn't write them.

777
00:31:47,562 --> 00:31:49,391
Just so you know, he wrote, "thank you", five times.

778
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:51,462
- Exactly.
- They wrote the wrong words.

779
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:57,032
(Se Chan and So Min get another penalty badge and water bomb.)

780
00:31:57,032 --> 00:31:59,032
This was better than the last time.

781
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,802
- How could you not guess it right?
- I haven't guessed any word right.

782
00:32:02,942 --> 00:32:04,611
Not a single word.

783
00:32:04,772 --> 00:32:07,911
This is why I'm not as afraid of penalties anymore.

784
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:09,641
This is hard to believe.

785
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,361
(So Min sets a record with 6 badges total.)

786
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:14,222
365 Retreat is over.

787
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,722
- Good work.
- Thank you.

788
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:20,522
The 1 with the most badges plus 2 people will be penalized.

789
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,121
The loser will choose one person,

790
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,462
and that person will choose another one.

791
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:26,262
- How many do you have?
- Today's loser is...

792
00:32:26,331 --> 00:32:27,901
Kwang Soo with 13 badges.

793
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:30,802
- 13 badges?
- Congratulations.

794
00:32:31,272 --> 00:32:32,772
I didn't come in last.

795
00:32:32,772 --> 00:32:35,042
- You have 10 badges.
- Despite your last spurt...

796
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:38,042
Kwang Soo, please choose one person.

797
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,611
(Please choose one person.)

798
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:41,641
(Hello?)

799
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:44,851
(Ignoring)

800
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,052
He seems to know.

801
00:32:47,722 --> 00:32:48,921
One person knows.

802
00:32:48,982 --> 00:32:51,752
I feel sorry whenever this happens.

803
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:53,462
(What should I do?)

804
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:55,792
Hold on. I'm meeting someone later.

805
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:58,562
(Ignoring)

806
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,232
- How many does So Min have?
- 10.

807
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,331
She caught up at the last minute.

808
00:33:04,331 --> 00:33:06,472
- 10?
- She got so many badges.

809
00:33:06,472 --> 00:33:07,752
She didn't guess any word right.

810
00:33:08,141 --> 00:33:09,641
I got splashed so many times.

811
00:33:10,212 --> 00:33:12,312
(Staring)

812
00:33:12,312 --> 00:33:14,111
(Ignoring)

813
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,442
(Looking away)

814
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,712
It should be among the three people.

815
00:33:18,712 --> 00:33:20,621
- I should include Se Chan too.
- I have only four.

816
00:33:20,621 --> 00:33:21,722
Whom do you choose?

817
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:23,921
I'll push the person from behind.

818
00:33:24,522 --> 00:33:28,192
(Who will be penalized alongside Kwang Soo?)

819
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:31,591
(Jae Seok is chosen.)

820
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:36,831
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo will be penalized together as always.)

821
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:40,472
There's someone with more badges than me.

822
00:33:40,472 --> 00:33:42,401
I chose the person who gave me the most badges.

823
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:45,972
The moment I heard the rules...

824
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:47,341
(What's the surprise?)

825
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,012
I decided to choose you if I lost.

826
00:33:49,512 --> 00:33:51,952
All right. Then...

827
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:53,052
(Jae Seok will choose one person.)

828
00:33:53,052 --> 00:33:55,222
I'll announce who can go home.

829
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,692
- Ji Hyo, you can go.
- She can go home?

830
00:33:57,692 --> 00:33:58,891
- Yes.
- Thank you.

831
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:00,621
- Se Chan can go home too.
- Really?

832
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,022
- Thank you.
- Really?

833
00:34:02,022 --> 00:34:04,192
- You should take care of your kids.
- Thank you.

834
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,532
- Thank you.
- "Ya man".

835
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:07,732
- Bye.
- "Ya man"!

836
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:10,831
(Jong Kook looks away.)

837
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:13,542
(Seok Jin is in denial.)

838
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:15,942
(Thinking)

839
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:18,312
If I choose Jong Kook, I think he'll make a scene.

840
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:21,781
(If I choose Jong Kook, I think he'll make a scene.)

841
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:24,051
- You'll make a scene.
- No.

842
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:25,112
I won't.

843
00:34:25,712 --> 00:34:26,882
You can go home.

844
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:29,951
You gave a badge to someone else.

845
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:33,292
- All right.
- In the end...

846
00:34:33,292 --> 00:34:37,931
(Maybe I should follow Jong Kook.)

847
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:39,092
You can go home.

848
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,402
So Min, come here.

849
00:34:42,962 --> 00:34:44,331
So Min.

850
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:45,831
(She fails.)

851
00:34:45,831 --> 00:34:47,741
Here we are again.

852
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:49,842
Why do we keep going after each other?

853
00:34:49,842 --> 00:34:51,042
I don't know.

854
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:53,312
We could go after those people, but why?

855
00:34:53,781 --> 00:34:55,781
(I wonder as well.)

856
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:57,502
All right. Let me whisper in your ear.

857
00:34:58,152 --> 00:35:00,822
Come here. I'll tell you one by one.

858
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,592
Do as I say on the count of three.

859
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:06,661
(Whispering)

860
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:10,031
(Whispering)

861
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:13,402
1, 2, 3.

862
00:35:13,462 --> 00:35:14,661
Bye.

863
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,871
(So Min is going home.)

864
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:18,931
- Bye.
- Okay.

865
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:20,301
Okay.

866
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,442
So Min.

867
00:35:21,942 --> 00:35:23,871
- Congratulations.
- Good job.

868
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:27,212
The three of you have to sign autographs in the room.

869
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:29,081
- That's a lot.
- That's too much.

870
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:31,152
- That's too much.
- That's 365 sheets of paper?

871
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,351
That's so much.

872
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,781
(It is a huge stack.)

873
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:39,922
As I told you earlier, you'll sign 365 autographs...

874
00:35:39,922 --> 00:35:43,632
for our fans. We'll chose 365 fans...

875
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:45,562
- on social media.
- I see.

876
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:46,801
- Okay.
- Okay.

877
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:50,031
What if not many people want Kwang Soo's?

878
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:53,942
(What if not many people want Kwang Soo's?)

879
00:35:53,942 --> 00:35:57,272
I'm making more than you, so there might be some left.

880
00:35:57,641 --> 00:35:58,942
I'm making 65 more.

881
00:35:58,942 --> 00:36:01,112
I haven't signed 100 autographs in a long time.

882
00:36:01,112 --> 00:36:03,141
(They start signing.)

883
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:06,752
Back in 2007, you asked me for an autograph.

884
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:08,482
I'm finally giving you one.

885
00:36:08,482 --> 00:36:10,451
(It's for you, Seok Jin.)

886
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:12,121
- Seok Jin.
- It's for my son.

887
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,761
- Sure.
- It was for him.

888
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:15,962
I just remembered you asking me in 2007.

889
00:36:15,962 --> 00:36:17,431
Why did you write my name?

890
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:19,462
It's for my son.

891
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:21,362
It's been more than 10 years.

892
00:36:22,132 --> 00:36:23,232
I can't believe it.

893
00:36:23,232 --> 00:36:24,331
(And...)

894
00:36:24,331 --> 00:36:25,601
- Kwang Soo.
- What?

895
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:28,042
You asked me for an autograph. Here's your autograph.

896
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:29,701
- Hey, 10 sheets...
- Hold on a second. You wrote,

897
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:31,241
"Grow more, and be 3m tall."

898
00:36:31,241 --> 00:36:34,911
(Jae Seok wrote, "Grow more, and be 3m tall.")

899
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:36,911
- What nonsense is this?
- I want you to be taller.

900
00:36:36,911 --> 00:36:38,628
- What's this about?
- I want you to be taller.

901
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:40,851
- I want you to grow more.
- I can't be 3m tall.

902
00:36:40,851 --> 00:36:42,482
I would like you to grow more...

903
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:44,792
and be 3m tall so you can be taller than a giraffe.

904
00:36:45,022 --> 00:36:47,161
- What do I get in return for that?
- I mean...

905
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:49,721
I only wrote that because I wanted you to be taller.

906
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,991
Let's rock-paper-scissors for 10 cards.

907
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,402
- Pardon?
- The loser will take the cards.

908
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:55,402
Seok Jin.

909
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:57,378
Why don't we do it for 50? It will be just 1 game.

910
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:59,371
Hold on. I'll bet everything I have left.

911
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,772
- How about the rest of the cards?
- Okay.

912
00:37:00,772 --> 00:37:01,942
- Okay.
- That's great.

913
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,691
- The loser will take them all.
- I have exactly 25 cards.

914
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:07,181
- My gosh.
- I have more than 65 cards.

915
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:09,312
- Exactly. This is more than before.
- That's a lot.

916
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:10,681
- Will we do rock-paper-scissors?
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

917
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:11,982
Let's draw lots.

918
00:37:12,112 --> 00:37:13,322
My gosh, please.

919
00:37:13,322 --> 00:37:14,422
(The one who draws the card with an X mark gets them all.)

920
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:16,051
All right. Among these cards,

921
00:37:16,081 --> 00:37:17,991
- only one card has an X mark.
- Okay.

922
00:37:17,991 --> 00:37:19,431
It's better to get whatever is left.

923
00:37:19,491 --> 00:37:21,291
When it's against them, it's better that way.

924
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:24,592
I always picked the one in the middle, but this time...

925
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:25,761
(Seok Jin chooses the card first.)

926
00:37:25,761 --> 00:37:27,962
(He grabs one confidently.)

927
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,632
- I'll take this one.
- Give me the card that fell.

928
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:30,772
(I'll take the one that fell.)

929
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:31,931
Give it to me.

930
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:33,672
Are we filming the episode for next week?

931
00:37:33,672 --> 00:37:36,342
(By the way, are we filming the episode for next week?)

932
00:37:36,342 --> 00:37:38,272
- You guys wanted to play this.
- Are we?

933
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:39,511
Won't this episode end?

934
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:42,621
- It's amazing we still have games.
- My gosh, this retreat...

935
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:45,212
There's a card with an X mark.

936
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:46,351
(The one who drew that card gets 75 cards.)

937
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:47,351
Please.

938
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:49,221
Okay. Okay!

939
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:51,351
(Seok Jin's card is empty. He's exempted.)

940
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,192
Okay!

941
00:37:53,422 --> 00:37:54,491
Okay!

942
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:56,661
(Kwang Soo gets an empty card too. He's exempted as well.)

943
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:58,632
- Okay!
- Okay!

944
00:38:01,732 --> 00:38:05,371
(Jae Seok takes all 75 cards.)

945
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:07,772
- Let's play one more.
- No way.

946
00:38:07,772 --> 00:38:09,141
- Come on. Let's play one more.
- For how many?

947
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,712
- For whatever you have left.
- For my leftover cards? Okay.

948
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,818
Play for the leftover cards.

949
00:38:11,842 --> 00:38:13,181
My goodness.

950
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:15,042
Hey, I had 25 cards left. Now, I have 75 cards left?

951
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,282
(Jae Seok who initially had 25 cards wins 75 cards now.)

952
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:21,351
I smell a gas leak from somewhere.

953
00:38:21,482 --> 00:38:22,822
Right? It's quite strong.

954
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,422
- Go check on it.
- What if something blows up?

955
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:27,422
(They continue signing autographs.)

956
00:38:27,422 --> 00:38:28,692
So Min is still here.

957
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:30,192
What are you doing here?

958
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:31,491
You didn't go home yet?

959
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:34,132
- What's she doing here?
- She didn't leave yet.

960
00:38:34,132 --> 00:38:35,462
Are you spending the night here?

961
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:36,601
(Here's a mysterious guest who didn't check out.)

962
00:38:36,601 --> 00:38:38,331
- What's wrong with So Min?
- My goodness.

963
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:39,431
What did you do?

964
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,151
- Has she lost her mind?
- What's going on?

965
00:38:41,342 --> 00:38:44,471
- What are you doing here?
- I got too drenched.

966
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:45,842
Maybe I should take a shower too.

967
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:47,712
You guys started it. How is it going?

968
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:49,612
- We're almost done.
- We're about done.

969
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:51,052
(They are still signing autographs.)

970
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:53,522
Hey. That smell from earlier.

971
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:55,851
(That mysterious gas smell)

972
00:38:55,951 --> 00:38:57,152
(Was the source of the smell...)

973
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:59,121
- We smelled gas earlier.
- What?

974
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:02,398
I get your fart smells awful, but how could it smell like gas?

975
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:04,991
(Exactly. This is unbelievable.)

976
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,062
Seok Jin.

977
00:39:06,161 --> 00:39:08,261
- It wasn't me. I'm serious.
- Wait.

978
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,431
I'm leaving now.

979
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:11,272
- Seok Jin, I'm almost done too.
- I'll practice my autograph.

980
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:13,318
- We can finish at the same time.
- You're done too.

981
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:15,272
- I'm done too.
- Here's one from me.

982
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:17,971
- All right, everyone.
- Yes?

983
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:20,641
You finished signing 365 autographs.

984
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:21,982
- Yes, we did.
- Goodness.

985
00:39:21,982 --> 00:39:23,652
(Yes! We can finally get off work.)

986
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,781
- It's finally over.
- We did 364 cards.

987
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,681
- We'll send them out to our fans.
- Okay.

988
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,092
What's wrong with you? Who's that old lady?

989
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:34,161
(I'm going home now too.)

990
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:35,261
My goodness.

991
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:36,531
Everyone, you may go home.

992
00:39:36,531 --> 00:39:38,761
- Okay. Good job.
- Good work, everyone.

993
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:41,801
(And finally, )

994
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:48,542
(It's the final week of the 4-week Family Package Project.)

995
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:51,812
(Depending on the results of the weekly races, )

996
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:55,141
(the winning team puts their names on the Luxury Package roulette.)

997
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:58,312
(The losing team puts their names on the Shuddering Package roulette.)

998
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,351
(It's the grand finale of the Family Package Project.)

999
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:06,292
(Their fates will be determined at last.)

1000
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:11,062
(On the day of the 4th filming for the Family Project)

1001
00:40:11,062 --> 00:40:13,502
(It hints that this will be the final race.)

1002
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:15,161
(This is the roulette with names that accumulated for 3 weeks.)

1003
00:40:15,161 --> 00:40:17,531
- Hello.
- Hi.

1004
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:19,261
- My gosh, where are we going?
- Hello.

1005
00:40:19,371 --> 00:40:20,731
I don't want to see this roulette!

1006
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:22,601
(Go away.)

1007
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,672
Stop it. I already gave up.

1008
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:25,772
Stop it.

1009
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:27,641
- This is a nightmare.
- Hello.

1010
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,281
- Hi.
- Hi.

1011
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:30,902
- Hello, Seok Jin.
- How have you been?

1012
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:32,982
How have you been?

1013
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:35,752
Be honest. You don't care if Jin Young had been good or not.

1014
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:38,322
Exactly. When he asked me if I had been good,

1015
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:40,221
he shifted his attention to somewhere else.

1016
00:40:40,761 --> 00:40:42,491
I didn't think about you at all for a week.

1017
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:44,962
(I didn't think about you at all for the time I didn't see you.)

1018
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:46,031
(He's completely honest.)

1019
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,511
- Then you shouldn't have asked.
- It's the same with you too.

1020
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:50,272
- My gosh.
- Haha, come here.

1021
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:51,402
- My gosh, Haha is...
- Haha.

1022
00:40:51,402 --> 00:40:52,402
Are you...

1023
00:40:52,402 --> 00:40:54,272
Is Dream studying colors now?

1024
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,101
- Is Dream studying colors now?
- Haha.

1025
00:40:56,241 --> 00:40:57,971
- Jae Seok.
- Come here, Haha.

1026
00:40:58,141 --> 00:40:59,421
Is your son learning colors now?

1027
00:40:59,741 --> 00:41:01,342
- I can't believe him.
- Hello.

1028
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:02,442
He's studying colors?

1029
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:04,482
- You look adorable.
- My goodness, our outfits...

1030
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:06,522
- My gosh, look at our outfits.
- There's a clear distinction.

1031
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:08,022
The outfits are visibly different.

1032
00:41:08,121 --> 00:41:10,351
- It's funny. Your outfits are dark.
- They're colorful, and we're dull.

1033
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:11,652
Our outfits are colorful.

1034
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:12,721
(This is a color TV.)

1035
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,361
- Good people versus bad people.
- Right.

1036
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:16,632
- You bad jerks.
- Do you like black outfits?

1037
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:20,962
Da Hee isn't here today.

1038
00:41:20,962 --> 00:41:24,801
Her filming for a drama is getting longer than she originally thought.

1039
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:27,002
She can't join us only for the opening segment.

1040
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:28,471
- It hasn't ended yet.
- She's on her way now.

1041
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:29,641
- We must be understanding.
- But Da Hee...

1042
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:32,342
- must be here for So Min, - Right.

1043
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:33,482
So she can scold her.

1044
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,212
She needs to be scolded.

1045
00:41:35,212 --> 00:41:37,281
- I felt the catharsis.
- Exactly.

1046
00:41:37,482 --> 00:41:38,712
No one could scold her.

1047
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:40,721
- Da Hee bluntly scolded her.
- Precisely.

1048
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,081
- It was nice that she was blunt.
- It was nice.

1049
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:43,922
In the back, you can see...

1050
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:45,851
- Come on. This is...
- No.

1051
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:47,322
- This is the final week.
- I'm so scared.

1052
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:49,298
- The final week.
- Don't you think you're too mean?

1053
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:51,531
- Will it be decided today?
- I thought hard about this.

1054
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:53,611
What have we done wrong for them to keep doing this?

1055
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,261
So Min is certain that she'll get the Shuddering Package.

1056
00:41:55,261 --> 00:41:56,431
- No way.
- There's a lot.

1057
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:58,701
Sang Yeob is sure to be chosen for the Shuddering Package.

1058
00:41:58,701 --> 00:41:59,842
- It's a done deal for Sang Yeob.
- It's over for him.

1059
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:01,378
- He will definitely get that.
- It won't be otherwise for him.

1060
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:02,741
I signed up at a gym.

1061
00:42:03,842 --> 00:42:05,947
- You want to get in shape?
- I want to train myself.

1062
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:08,342
- Ji Hyo ran out of her luck.
- Exactly.

1063
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:10,681
She usually wins rock-paper-scissors,

1064
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,081
- but she's not lucky with the rest.
- Just wait.

1065
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:14,351
- My luck will be recovered soon.
- Rock-paper-scissors

1066
00:42:14,351 --> 00:42:16,351
(Rock-paper-scissors)

1067
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:17,491
Be quiet.

1068
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:20,592
(What's wrong with you?)

1069
00:42:20,592 --> 00:42:22,512
Look at an empty space, and play it by yourself.

1070
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,991
(She isn't able to read the room and adds fuel to the fire instead.)

1071
00:42:25,991 --> 00:42:27,502
This is great. Ji Hyo and Da Hee...

1072
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:29,531
are teaching So Min a lesson these days.

1073
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:31,801
So Min, I think you'll get a beating soon.

1074
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:33,542
That's why So Min told the staff...

1075
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:35,222
that she was most comfortable with Han Na.

1076
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:37,612
She chose Han Na because Han Na is nice.

1077
00:42:37,672 --> 00:42:38,712
She said that...

1078
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:41,123
- she's comfortable with Han Na.
- She's younger than me.

1079
00:42:41,612 --> 00:42:43,112
So Min is most comfortable with Han Na.

1080
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:44,252
I like Han Na the best.

1081
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:45,451
(I like Han Na.)

1082
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:47,351
All right. So today's race will...

1083
00:42:47,351 --> 00:42:49,482
decide the final result of the Family Project...

1084
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:51,891
regarding the Luxury and Shuddering Packages.

1085
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:54,592
It's the final race. It's called You Take the Shuddering Package.

1086
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:56,632
(You Take the Shuddering Package)

1087
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:59,072
- You Take the Shuddering Package.
- Okay. We're almost done.

1088
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:02,132
You'll get Running Balls depending on the missions' results.

1089
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,331
Six members who are chosen by the draw of the Running Balls...

1090
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:06,031
will list their names for the Shuddering Package.

1091
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:09,672
(6 chosen members will be listed for the Shuddering Package.)

1092
00:43:10,911 --> 00:43:12,542
We'll use the Running Balls.

1093
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:13,942
- I see. Okay.
- My gosh.

1094
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:17,387
Since we're at Incheon International Airport, are we going somewhere?

1095
00:43:17,411 --> 00:43:18,482
We're going abroad.

1096
00:43:18,551 --> 00:43:19,712
- Are we all going abroad?
- They asked...

1097
00:43:19,712 --> 00:43:21,152
- me to bring the passport.
- You told us to bring the passport.

1098
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:22,657
- You brought my passport.
- I did bring it.

1099
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:24,292
- You all brought your passports.
- Yes.

1100
00:43:24,322 --> 00:43:25,951
You will split into 3 teams of 4.

1101
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:28,271
You will participate in the race from different locations.

1102
00:43:28,391 --> 00:43:29,592
Bring in the backpacks.

1103
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:31,792
- What's that?
- What is it?

1104
00:43:31,962 --> 00:43:33,802
- There are only three.
- Those are backpacks.

1105
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:35,902
- Those backpacks are familiar.
- My gosh.

1106
00:43:35,902 --> 00:43:37,407
- They are so colorful.
- Yes, they are.

1107
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:39,572
They say, "Family", "Global", and "Package".

1108
00:43:39,572 --> 00:43:40,852
- Is that so?
- There are three.

1109
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,942
For the locations, the oldest members,

1110
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:47,511
Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Jong Kook, will be the team leaders.

1111
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:50,712
You will choose the backpack which has the final location.

1112
00:43:51,252 --> 00:43:54,752
Do missions at the location you find from your backpack.

1113
00:43:54,752 --> 00:43:57,851
Here's my concern about this.

1114
00:43:58,121 --> 00:44:00,962
You're saying that Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and I are team leaders?

1115
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:04,362
I know that Seok Jin is the oldest,

1116
00:44:04,362 --> 00:44:05,922
but he's not ready to be a team leader.

1117
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:07,632
- Right.
- He's not suitable...

1118
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:09,331
Are you looking down on Seok Jin?

1119
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:10,732
- Seok Jin.
- Come here.

1120
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,052
- Teach him a lesson.
- I will...

1121
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:14,492
It's because I didn't give him a beating when he was young.

1122
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:17,042
- You, come here.
- When he was young?

1123
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,812
- I will...
- It was when he debuted.

1124
00:44:18,812 --> 00:44:21,641
That little brat. I'll punch you in the philtrum.

1125
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:23,781
(I'll punch you in the philtrum.)

1126
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,781
- He's never hit anyone.
- Listen.

1127
00:44:25,781 --> 00:44:27,551
- Seok Jin isn't ready yet.
- I heard that...

1128
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:29,281
- I can... - you've never punched anyone.

1129
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:30,692
I've never punched anyone.

1130
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:31,951
This is what I'm most worried about.

1131
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:34,362
What if Seok Jin punches me, but it doesn't hurt me at all?

1132
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:35,991
- Seok Jin might be flustered?
- I think...

1133
00:44:35,991 --> 00:44:37,491
- He might cry.
- Right.

1134
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:39,261
- He might cry.
- It would make him cry even more.

1135
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,502
(We'll root for you until you get your strong punch.)

1136
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:42,831
- "It doesn't hurt at all."
- His wrist will be bent.

1137
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:45,371
- He cries even more after that.
- He will hurt his own wrist.

1138
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:47,201
What's this?

1139
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,301
(What are in these backpacks?)

1140
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:49,942
- Do we need to choose one?
- My gosh.

1141
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:51,818
- "Global" doesn't look good.
- We'll go according to our choice?

1142
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:54,312
Inside the backpacks, you can find the locations for the missions.

1143
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:55,982
If you accomplish the mission, you will get four Running Balls.

1144
00:44:55,982 --> 00:44:58,851
If you fail, you'll get 40 Running Balls.

1145
00:44:58,851 --> 00:45:00,581
(Failing means 40 Running Balls.)

1146
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:02,982
- What?
- That's a huge difference.

1147
00:45:02,982 --> 00:45:04,351
Regardless of the mission's outcome,

1148
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:06,661
if you cannot arrive at the location for the closing segment...

1149
00:45:06,661 --> 00:45:09,022
(If they can't arrive where the closing segment will be held...)

1150
00:45:09,022 --> 00:45:11,491
You will get an additional 40 Running Balls.

1151
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:13,807
- You must arrive within today.
- Why wouldn't we be able to?

1152
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,261
- We might not be able to arrive?
- If you can't arrive...

1153
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:16,531
Why can't we? Are you sending us somewhere?

1154
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:17,801
(Where will they depart for?)

1155
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:18,931
Okay. Let's choose.

1156
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:20,871
- I like yellow.
- Sure, take it.

1157
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:23,471
I like yellow, but in my opinion,

1158
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,842
- It says, "global" on it.
- "global"...

1159
00:45:26,172 --> 00:45:27,717
- might not be a bad one.
- It will be the contrary?

1160
00:45:27,741 --> 00:45:29,511
- It may be the opposite.
- Right.

1161
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:32,982
It says, "global", but we won't go abroad from here.

1162
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:34,551
"Global".

1163
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,121
This is the hottest color of 2018.

1164
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:39,051
- That's right.
- Which one? This one?

1165
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,362
- I like yellow.
- Is that so?

1166
00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:43,491
- The hottest color suits black.
- I think...

1167
00:45:43,592 --> 00:45:45,161
- I'll take the "package".
- Okay.

1168
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,732
(Seok Jin takes the backpack with "package".)

1169
00:45:46,732 --> 00:45:48,761
- You chose your backpacks.
- Okay.

1170
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:52,232
- Check your locations.
- Really?

1171
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:54,277
Do we open up the big compartment?

1172
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,172
- What if it follows the name?
- My gosh, look.

1173
00:45:56,172 --> 00:45:57,772
- Hey, "global"...
- I'm sure that won't be the case.

1174
00:45:57,772 --> 00:45:59,088
- It can't be.
- It won't be predictable, right?

1175
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:00,241
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

1176
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,918
- Are you going abroad?
- What is it, Jae Seok?

1177
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:03,312
What does it say?

1178
00:46:03,312 --> 00:46:06,181
(He holds his breath.)

1179
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:07,822
- Are you serious?
- What's in it?

1180
00:46:07,882 --> 00:46:09,951
- Are you going to Europe?
- Isn't this crazy?

1181
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:14,092
(He wins a trip to Hong Kong.)

1182
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:15,641
- Good for him.
- Time for Hong Kong.

1183
00:46:16,592 --> 00:46:19,092
(You want me to go to Hong Kong? I must be back here by today.)

1184
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,701
- You're going to Hong Kong?
- I mean...

1185
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,232
- We...
- You're going to Hong Kong?

1186
00:46:22,232 --> 00:46:23,902
- Jae Seok has the worst luck.
- We're going to an island.

1187
00:46:23,902 --> 00:46:26,542
(The card in the backpack with "family" says "island".)

1188
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:28,141
It's an island.

1189
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:29,842
It says "island".

1190
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:33,741
(Both of you are doomed.)

1191
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,442
- Is it an island?
- My goodness.

1192
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:38,181
- An island?
- Jong Kook is wearing shorts.

1193
00:46:38,181 --> 00:46:40,022
- What about Seok Jin?
- Is it an island in Korea?

1194
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:41,851
- It's land.
- Land?

1195
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:45,252
(It says "land" in the "package" bag.)

1196
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:47,491
- Land is good.
- It's the best.

1197
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:48,721
It's the best.

1198
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:50,661
"Package" was the best.

1199
00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:52,831
- I made a mistake.
- Land is in Korea.

1200
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:56,161
Jae Seok thought "global" wouldn't be going abroad.

1201
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:58,502
- He was wrong.
- I thought it would be "package".

1202
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,942
- How can we go to Hong Kong?
- Is it outside of Seoul?

1203
00:47:00,942 --> 00:47:03,101
- Is this actual Hong Kong?
- After clearing the mission...

1204
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:05,212
- Do you mean Chinatown?
- Is it actually Hong Kong?

1205
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:07,812
You'll arrive there today.

1206
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:10,511
- Before that...
- He pretends not to listen.

1207
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:12,181
(The producer ignores Jae Seok.)

1208
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,781
Here's the mission.

1209
00:47:13,781 --> 00:47:15,022
This is harsh.

1210
00:47:15,022 --> 00:47:16,081
(Hong Kong is already determined.)

1211
00:47:16,081 --> 00:47:18,192
We aren't going to Hong Kong now, are we?

1212
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,792
- Now is perfect to go.
- Of course.

1213
00:47:19,792 --> 00:47:20,962
It's the perfect time.

1214
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:22,292
How can we go to Hong Kong now?

1215
00:47:22,292 --> 00:47:25,132
Hong Kong is a place to go for leisure.

1216
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,031
We can't go there for one day.

1217
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:28,962
We need to stay there for about three days.

1218
00:47:28,962 --> 00:47:30,801
It's a place to go leisurely.

1219
00:47:31,002 --> 00:47:33,871
- How can this be Hong Kong?
- This is important.

1220
00:47:33,871 --> 00:47:36,241
Doesn't it take 3.5 hours to go to Hong Kong?

1221
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,312
- Going back and forth...
- Are you still talking about it?

1222
00:47:39,312 --> 00:47:41,882
(Are you still talking about Hong Kong?)

1223
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:43,851
- Stop it.
- Seriously.

1224
00:47:43,851 --> 00:47:45,482
- That's enough.
- I wondered what you were saying.

1225
00:47:45,482 --> 00:47:46,781
I really like...

1226
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,652
- I like Hong Kong.
- Stop it. Just go to Hong Kong.

1227
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:50,391
- Just go.
- How can I go there for a day?

1228
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:51,551
Goodness.

1229
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:53,322
He's getting scolded.

1230
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:55,322
Let's divide into teams.

1231
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:58,891
You'll play Door to Your Fate to determine the teams.

1232
00:47:58,891 --> 00:47:59,931
"Door to Your Fate"?

1233
00:47:59,931 --> 00:48:03,402
(Door to Your Fate to determine the teams)

1234
00:48:03,572 --> 00:48:05,101
Here's how you divide into teams.

1235
00:48:05,101 --> 00:48:07,801
Three team leaders will hide behind the curtains.

1236
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:10,471
Team leaders will stand behind each curtain door.

1237
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,612
The rest of the members will choose a door each.

1238
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:15,681
You'll team up with the team leader behind the door of your choice.

1239
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:17,911
- We don't know what will happen.
- This is all luck.

1240
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:21,252
As each member chooses, team leaders may change the door.

1241
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:22,851
I see. Can we keep changing?

1242
00:48:22,922 --> 00:48:25,851
- The three stand behind a door.
- Okay.

1243
00:48:26,092 --> 00:48:28,462
My team stays on land.

1244
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:30,092
Let me make myself clear.

1245
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,891
I really like yellow.

1246
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,462
- Will you choose yellow?
- Yes, yellow.

1247
00:48:33,462 --> 00:48:34,732
I will avoid yellow.

1248
00:48:34,732 --> 00:48:36,931
- I told you that mine was yellow.
- Avoid yellow at all costs.

1249
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:38,672
Will Da Hee join the last team?

1250
00:48:38,672 --> 00:48:39,672
Right.

1251
00:48:40,002 --> 00:48:41,471
She doesn't get to choose.

1252
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,042
Who will go in first?

1253
00:48:43,042 --> 00:48:44,172
I'll go.

1254
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:45,842
- Kwang Soo.
- Guess whom it will be.

1255
00:48:46,172 --> 00:48:48,141
- Follow your feelings.
- Isn't land the best?

1256
00:48:48,141 --> 00:48:50,612
Your outfit matches well with Hong Kong.

1257
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:52,581
- That's right.
- Go to Hong Kong.

1258
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,022
You look like Chow Yun Fat.

1259
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:55,652
(You look like Chow Yun Fat.)

1260
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:57,092
- Chow Yun Fat?
- I'm just saying it.

1261
00:48:57,092 --> 00:48:58,451
You look like Chow Yun Fat.

1262
00:48:58,551 --> 00:49:00,022
How do I look like him?

1263
00:49:00,822 --> 00:49:02,121
- How so?
- He's an actor.

1264
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:03,491
Your jaw reminds me of him.

1265
00:49:05,062 --> 00:49:06,462
- I have no idea.
- Just go.

1266
00:49:06,531 --> 00:49:07,732
I'll decide.

1267
00:49:08,431 --> 00:49:09,732
Please get unlucky.

1268
00:49:10,002 --> 00:49:11,101
I choose number three.

1269
00:49:11,101 --> 00:49:13,672
(Kwang Soo chooses the red curtain.)

1270
00:49:13,672 --> 00:49:15,371
- That's the unlucky one.
- Let's avoid number three.

1271
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:17,641
The team leader is standing behind the curtain.

1272
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:20,942
(Everyone hopes that Kwang Soo will go to Hong Kong.)

1273
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:24,851
(Which one did Kwang Soo choose?)

1274
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:30,391
(Hello, Kwang Soo.)

1275
00:49:30,391 --> 00:49:31,551
Jong Kook.

1276
00:49:32,252 --> 00:49:34,292
(Kwang Soo joins Team Island.)

1277
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,721
- Come in.
- It's an island.

1278
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:37,292
- Come in.
- That's a good choice.

1279
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:38,692
- It's an island.
- It's an island.

1280
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:40,031
- He's pretending to be happy.
- It's an island.

1281
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:41,261
(He's pretending to be happy.)

1282
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:42,931
I choose number two.

1283
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:44,232
Seriously.

1284
00:49:45,632 --> 00:49:47,172
Team leaders change randomly.

1285
00:49:47,172 --> 00:49:48,342
- Who's next?
- It's you.

1286
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:49,741
- It's me.
- So Min.

1287
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:51,241
- It's me.
- Good luck.

1288
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:52,572
Good luck, So Min.

1289
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,141
I bet So Min will be attracted to Jae Seok.

1290
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:56,382
No way.

1291
00:49:56,382 --> 00:49:57,781
You and Jae Seok...

1292
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:59,951
- will pair up today.
- Just go, So Min.

1293
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,252
- Ji Hyo.
- You'll choose...

1294
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:02,581
- Hold my hand.
- No.

1295
00:50:02,581 --> 00:50:04,252
- Just once, please.
- It's okay.

1296
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:05,592
Please go.

1297
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:07,592
(Go away, unlucky hand.)

1298
00:50:07,592 --> 00:50:09,322
You'll team with Jae Seok today.

1299
00:50:09,322 --> 00:50:10,391
Did Jae Seok go in here?

1300
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:12,632
- I bet Jae Seok is smiling.
- In that case,

1301
00:50:12,632 --> 00:50:14,502
Jae Seok definitely switched doors.

1302
00:50:15,301 --> 00:50:16,871
Here's my final decision.

1303
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:19,331
Are you picking yellow? That was Jae Seok's choice.

1304
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:21,241
- They keep switching.
- Go ahead.

1305
00:50:21,241 --> 00:50:22,442
(He can't be behind the yellow curtain.)

1306
00:50:22,442 --> 00:50:23,772
He may be behind number three.

1307
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:24,812
Open the curtain.

1308
00:50:24,812 --> 00:50:26,141
In 1, 2, 3.

1309
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:31,612
(She had a doubt, but she was wrong.)

1310
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:34,882
I knew that they'd be on the same team.

1311
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:36,221
I'm tired of her!

1312
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:38,351
- They attract like magnets.
- She's on my team again.

1313
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,391
- They're the opposite ends.
- Why didn't you switch curtains?

1314
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:43,062
Goodness, So Min.

1315
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:45,732
Why did you choose this curtain?

1316
00:50:46,062 --> 00:50:47,062
(So Min joins Team Hong Kong.)

1317
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:49,431
I clearly told you that I like yellow.

1318
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,971
Didn't you hate yellow?

1319
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:53,442
- Goodness, So Min.
- I'm in trouble.

1320
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:54,871
I'm definitely doomed today.

1321
00:50:54,871 --> 00:50:56,471
She's so unlucky.

1322
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:58,572
I'm doomed today. I'm in trouble.

1323
00:50:58,971 --> 00:51:00,812
- What do I do?
- Good luck.

1324
00:51:01,612 --> 00:51:02,741
It's my turn.

1325
00:51:03,112 --> 00:51:05,851
If Jin Young joins Jong Kook's team again,

1326
00:51:05,951 --> 00:51:07,781
you two should date.

1327
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:10,092
If she picks Jong Kook, this will be fate.

1328
00:51:10,092 --> 00:51:11,252
It can't be helped.

1329
00:51:11,621 --> 00:51:14,922
- Goodbye - Goodbye

1330
00:51:14,922 --> 00:51:18,062
(Goodbye)

1331
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,331
(She reacts by dancing.)

1332
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:21,251
- Let it be Jong Kook.
- It has to be Jong Kook.

1333
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:25,601
(Whose team will Jin Young join?)

1334
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:29,801
(There is one man.)

1335
00:51:31,042 --> 00:51:32,141
Jong Kook.

1336
00:51:32,141 --> 00:51:34,312
- You two should date.
- You should date

1337
00:51:34,312 --> 00:51:37,051
How is this possible? How did it happen again?

1338
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:40,551
- You should date, you should date - Why did you do that?

1339
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:43,951
Jin Young was surprised too.

1340
00:51:44,152 --> 00:51:45,922
- I was surprised too.
- Were you?

1341
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:47,761
- How are they connected?
- They attract like magnets.

1342
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:50,031
- Jin Young is excited.
- They attract like magnets.

1343
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:52,062
(She's happy even if she's going to an island.)

1344
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:53,562
Is it my turn?

1345
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:55,462
Is it mine?

1346
00:51:55,601 --> 00:51:57,531
It'd be funny if no one chooses Seok Jin.

1347
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:00,101
- No one picks Seok Jin.
- He'll be lonely.

1348
00:52:00,101 --> 00:52:01,641
I'll stay on land alone.

1349
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:03,141
(No one has chosen Team Inland.)

1350
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:08,212
(Whom will Haha choose?)

1351
00:52:10,152 --> 00:52:11,312
Luxury.

1352
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:12,882
(Dear deity of luxuries)

1353
00:52:12,882 --> 00:52:14,882
Please let me be with a good team leader.

1354
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,822
(Please let me be with a good team leader.)

1355
00:52:16,822 --> 00:52:19,962
(He unveils the team leader.)

1356
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:22,661
(Here's a good team leader.)

1357
00:52:22,661 --> 00:52:23,732
Welcome.

1358
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:25,462
Welcome.

1359
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:28,201
- That's perfect.
- Welcome.

1360
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,701
No.

1361
00:52:29,831 --> 00:52:31,272
- Good luck.
- No.

1362
00:52:31,601 --> 00:52:33,442
He joined Seok Jin's team.

1363
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:34,842
That was his fate.

1364
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:36,842
I'll go next.

1365
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:38,442
- Go.
- You may go.

1366
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:39,471
Here I go.

1367
00:52:39,471 --> 00:52:41,141
(Next is the notoriously unlucky man.)

1368
00:52:41,442 --> 00:52:45,652
(Which team will he join?)

1369
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:46,721
I pick here.

1370
00:52:49,181 --> 00:52:51,391
(Welcome, Sang Yeob.)

1371
00:52:51,391 --> 00:52:52,522
Is it Sang Yeob?

1372
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:54,362
- Welcome.
- Is it Sang Yeob?

1373
00:52:54,362 --> 00:52:56,661
- Stay on land.
- You're with us.

1374
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:58,562
- What's going on?
- Come here.

1375
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:00,261
- What's this?
- Welcome to my team.

1376
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,462
- We're definitely getting penalty.
- Welcome.

1377
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:04,072
He's the most terrible.

1378
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,531
No, I'm not.

1379
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:07,542
Is it me?

1380
00:53:08,542 --> 00:53:09,601
To be honest,

1381
00:53:10,411 --> 00:53:13,281
I want to avoid Jong Kook the most.

1382
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,482
- You want to avoid him?
- Yes.

1383
00:53:15,911 --> 00:53:17,851
I prefer the other teams than Jong Kook's.

1384
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:21,752
Let's avoid Jong Kook.

1385
00:53:21,752 --> 00:53:23,121
It can't be Jong Kook.

1386
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:25,491
Go to Jong Kook, go to Jong Kook.

1387
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:28,192
It'll be Jong Kook, it'll be Jong Kook.

1388
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:30,261
- It'll be Jong Kook.
- If it isn't him...

1389
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:31,732
Welcome.

1390
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,161
It's Hong Kong.

1391
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:37,531
- Welcome.
- It's so far away!

1392
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:39,301
- Welcome.
- It's far away.

1393
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,042
- Welcome.
- It's too far.

1394
00:53:41,042 --> 00:53:42,701
(Se Chan joins Team Hong Kong.)

1395
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:44,471
This is so difficult.

1396
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:46,911
I'll keep it cool.

1397
00:53:47,781 --> 00:53:49,081
I choose the middle one.

1398
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:54,322
(Han Na picks the blue curtain. Whose team will she join?)

1399
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:57,692
(She walks with confidence.)

1400
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,022
1, 2, 3.

1401
00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,862
Welcome.

1402
00:54:01,462 --> 00:54:03,862
(Welcome to Hong Kong.)

1403
00:54:03,862 --> 00:54:06,092
- Han Na is coming to Hong Kong.
- Welcome.

1404
00:54:06,362 --> 00:54:08,132
- Hong Kong!
- So Min is the most excited.

1405
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:09,502
- Ji Hyo.
- Yes?

1406
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:11,331
- Our team is closed.
- Okay.

1407
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,772
- Really?
- Is our team complete?

1408
00:54:13,672 --> 00:54:18,241
The team that Ji Hyo doesn't pick will be joined by Da Hee.

1409
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,982
There's Da Hee left.

1410
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:21,502
(The remaining slot will be Da Hee's.)

1411
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:28,252
(Whose team will Ji Hyo join?)

1412
00:54:30,092 --> 00:54:31,152
(It's me, Seok Jin.)

1413
00:54:31,152 --> 00:54:32,822
Welcome.

1414
00:54:33,261 --> 00:54:35,362
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

1415
00:54:35,362 --> 00:54:36,692
We are on land.

1416
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,862
Welcome to our team.

1417
00:54:40,601 --> 00:54:42,431
I wanted to avoid you, Sang Yeob.

1418
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,931
- Why?
- I wanted to avoid you.

1419
00:54:44,931 --> 00:54:47,741
- I'm doing well today.
- I don't know about my team.

1420
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:50,542
Jong Kook feels uncomfortable with Da Hee.

1421
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,112
(There are many charismatic members on the island.)

1422
00:54:52,112 --> 00:54:53,781
This team will be crazy.

1423
00:54:53,781 --> 00:54:56,042
Jong Kook doesn't like people like Da Hee.

1424
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,382
(Da Hee is headstrong.)

1425
00:54:57,482 --> 00:54:59,312
(He feels a lot of pressure.)

1426
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:00,581
That's true.

1427
00:55:00,621 --> 00:55:02,281
We must do well on the mission today.

1428
00:55:02,281 --> 00:55:04,121
(He doesn't want to be scolded by Da Hee.)

1429
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:09,062
(Team Land, Team Hong Kong, Team Island)

1430
00:55:09,462 --> 00:55:12,092
This is Family Project Finale.

1431
00:55:12,092 --> 00:55:13,801
Your last mission is...

1432
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:16,101
You Clear That Mission.

1433
00:55:16,101 --> 00:55:19,942
(You Clear That Mission)

1434
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:21,002
You Clear That Mission.

1435
00:55:21,002 --> 00:55:23,471
Teams choose a mission for another team.

1436
00:55:23,471 --> 00:55:26,641
Each team submits a mission that they want others to clear.

1437
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:29,112
Among the 2 missions suggested by the teams and 1 by the staff,

1438
00:55:29,112 --> 00:55:30,752
one is chosen randomly.

1439
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:34,051
Clear the mission today in your designated locations.

1440
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:36,851
(Clear the mission today in your designated locations.)

1441
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:38,922
I know what Team Hong Kong should do.

1442
00:55:38,922 --> 00:55:40,462
Team Hong Kong is in trouble.

1443
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,562
(It takes a total of 7 hours.)

1444
00:55:41,562 --> 00:55:43,292
Here's a mission suggested by the staff.

1445
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:45,062
For Team Hong Kong,

1446
00:55:45,062 --> 00:55:47,831
find a Hong Kong Banjum in Hong Kong.

1447
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:50,701
(Find Hong Kong Banjum in Hong Kong.)

1448
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:52,531
- Have jjajangmyeon there.
- Stop it.

1449
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:55,172
- No way.
- It doesn't exist in Hong Kong.

1450
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:56,371
Seriously.

1451
00:55:56,542 --> 00:55:58,011
Stop it.

1452
00:55:58,011 --> 00:55:59,531
(Why would we find that in Hong Kong?)

1453
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,842
(Hong Kong is full of fancy food.)

1454
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:07,152
(They clear the mission by eating jjajangmyeon at Hong Kong Banjum.)

1455
00:56:07,152 --> 00:56:08,522
- Hong Kong Banjum?
- Wait.

1456
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:10,951
- That's nonsense.
- It makes no sense.

1457
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:14,592
We can't find that restaurant and travel for seven hours.

1458
00:56:14,991 --> 00:56:18,761
There are many Hong Kong Banjums in Mapo.

1459
00:56:18,761 --> 00:56:20,661
(There are many in Mapo.)

1460
00:56:20,931 --> 00:56:23,371
(Are you making fun of us?)

1461
00:56:23,371 --> 00:56:25,232
There are many by Sinsa Station.

1462
00:56:25,232 --> 00:56:26,641
Seriously.

1463
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:28,772
Why do we always eat noodles?

1464
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:31,141
(Dear director, why do we always eat noodles?)

1465
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:33,942
- What?
- Why do we always eat noodles?

1466
00:56:33,942 --> 00:56:36,342
- Be quiet.
- Team Hong Kong should...

1467
00:56:36,442 --> 00:56:38,351
eat buckwheat noodles in Hong Kong.

1468
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,451
Stop it.

1469
00:56:40,451 --> 00:56:43,051
Let me announce Team Island's mission.

1470
00:56:43,152 --> 00:56:45,851
You'll visit the "three brothers" island,

1471
00:56:45,851 --> 00:56:47,721
Shinshimo Island, in Incheon.

1472
00:56:47,721 --> 00:56:48,862
Incheon?

1473
00:56:49,721 --> 00:56:51,531
Incheon is so close.

1474
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:53,201
- It's close.
- Shinshimo Island?

1475
00:56:55,232 --> 00:56:59,172
(Shinshimo Island consists of 3 islands.)

1476
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:04,342
(What mission will they have to accomplish on that island?)

1477
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:07,942
You'll have to find three brothers and play yut against them.

1478
00:57:07,942 --> 00:57:10,181
You have to beat them with "mo" or "do".

1479
00:57:10,181 --> 00:57:11,882
(They have to win the yut game with "mo" or "do.)

1480
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:16,022
(Beat three brothers in a game of yut?)

1481
00:57:16,022 --> 00:57:18,051
- That'd be hard.
- That's easy.

1482
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:19,051
It'd be hard.

1483
00:57:19,051 --> 00:57:21,261
- We have to find three brothers.
- I mean...

1484
00:57:21,261 --> 00:57:23,232
- It won't be hard.
- It'll be hard.

1485
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:25,692
Playing yut is not hard.

1486
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,431
Eating jjajangmyeon is not hard either.

1487
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:29,632
(Eating jjajangmyeon is not hard either.)

1488
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:31,272
How could you say that?

1489
00:57:31,272 --> 00:57:32,402
(Jumping)

1490
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:34,772
What are you doing?

1491
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:36,712
- What's that?
- What's what?

1492
00:57:36,712 --> 00:57:37,971
How are you going to attack him?

1493
00:57:37,971 --> 00:57:39,141
It's a jump kick.

1494
00:57:39,141 --> 00:57:41,081
No one can help him.

1495
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,542
What are you doing?

1496
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,652
How can you be just standing there?

1497
00:57:43,652 --> 00:57:45,411
No one can help you. We'll die.

1498
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:46,922
Han Na and So Min, aren't you going to help me?

1499
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,922
- We can't.
- We have no power.

1500
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:50,451
Gosh. What about us?

1501
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:52,152
Let me announce Team Land's mission.

1502
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:53,192
(Team Land's mission)

1503
00:57:53,397 --> 00:57:55,525
Let me announce Team Land's mission.
(Team Land's mission)

1504
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:57,927
You'll visit rest areas and eat there.

1505
00:57:58,014 --> 00:58:00,161
(Eating at rest areas)

1506
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,940
(We can eat?)

1507
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:04,782
That sounds fun.

1508
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:06,751
I'm jealous.

1509
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,782
(The oasis on the road)

1510
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,992
(Team Land has to eat at rest areas.)

1511
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,322
(Jealous)

1512
00:58:17,521 --> 00:58:19,561
Choose either Yeongdong, Gyeongbu, or Honam Expressway.

1513
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:22,262
You have to visit every rest area on that expressway...

1514
00:58:22,262 --> 00:58:23,861
and eat their most popular dish.

1515
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:28,131
(Visit every rest area and eat their most popular dish.)

1516
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:30,441
- Every rest area?
- Yes.

1517
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:32,001
- All of them?
- All...

1518
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:33,171
What does that mean?

1519
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:34,671
(I knew it.)

1520
00:58:34,671 --> 00:58:36,282
Every rest area on the way?

1521
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:38,782
(There's nothing to be jealous of.)

1522
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:41,581
If their stomachs explode, do they fail?

1523
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:43,151
If their stomachs explode?

1524
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:44,981
Those are the missions we've prepared.

1525
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:47,892
Now, come up with a mission...

1526
00:58:47,892 --> 00:58:50,822
you want to give the other teams.

1527
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,662
- We can decide?
- We can give them a mission?

1528
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:57,361
- What should Team Island do?
- What should we write?

1529
00:58:57,361 --> 00:58:59,578
- Should they dig something out?
- I don't know what's there.

1530
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,302
- They should dig out clams.
- Clams?

1531
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:03,401
My goodness.

1532
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:06,271
Jae Seok is so scary.

1533
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:07,811
How many clams?

1534
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,912
- They should go into the mud.
- Are they in season?

1535
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:11,842
- 3 kinds...
- More than 20kg?

1536
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:15,182
Han Na, you're full of ideas.

1537
00:59:15,452 --> 00:59:17,182
- Per person?
- No.

1538
00:59:17,682 --> 00:59:19,892
- Han Na, you're mean.
- I was just asking.

1539
00:59:19,892 --> 00:59:21,251
I can't believe you.

1540
00:59:21,322 --> 00:59:22,552
75kg.

1541
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:24,791
(Meanwhile, Team Island...)

1542
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:26,231
That one is hilarious.

1543
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,361
- And then...
- Isn't this too much?

1544
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:30,461
These guys are so mean.

1545
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:32,802
- You guys are full of ideas.
- We're done.

1546
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,242
(They've decided on their missions.)

1547
00:59:34,432 --> 00:59:36,501
We have your mission ideas.

1548
00:59:36,501 --> 00:59:38,771
But some of them are impossible...

1549
00:59:38,771 --> 00:59:40,372
to finish today.

1550
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:42,412
- We'll have to make adjustments.
- Who wrote them?

1551
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:43,541
I mean...

1552
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,211
We have to find them...

1553
00:59:46,381 --> 00:59:47,981
and punish them.

1554
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:49,852
All the unreasonable ideas should...

1555
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:52,352
- There he goes again.
- It's been a while.

1556
00:59:53,521 --> 00:59:55,992
Let's look at Team Hong Kong's mission first.

1557
00:59:56,061 --> 00:59:57,622
This was what one team wrote.

1558
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,861
"Find an old lady..."

1559
00:59:59,861 --> 01:00:00,932
(Find an old lady.)

1560
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:02,961
"And share a strand of noodle with her at Hong Kong Banjum."

1561
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:06,271
(Share a strand of noodle with an old lady.)

1562
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,972
- You wrote it, right?
- What?

1563
01:00:08,072 --> 01:00:09,401
What's wrong?

1564
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:10,972
(Do you remember it?)

1565
01:00:10,972 --> 01:00:13,441
Everyone does the noodle game.

1566
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:15,142
- You...
- What's so wrong about it?

1567
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:17,541
(What's wrong?)

1568
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:22,352
(It'll look like this.)

1569
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,722
That's absurd.

1570
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:26,421
- What?
- It's ridiculous.

1571
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:29,561
You're clever.

1572
01:00:29,791 --> 01:00:31,561
The person should be either over 80...

1573
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,162
or under two.

1574
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,561
(Either over 80 or under 2)

1575
01:00:35,432 --> 01:00:37,162
I mean...

1576
01:00:37,162 --> 01:00:39,262
- You jerk.
- What?

1577
01:00:39,262 --> 01:00:41,401
(You jerk.)

1578
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:45,202
- What did you say?
- You're a jerk.

1579
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:47,671
The next one is problematic.

1580
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:49,811
"Get a waiting number of 1001..."

1581
01:00:49,811 --> 01:00:51,581
- "at a restaurant."
- Who wrote it?

1582
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,481
(Get a waiting number of 1001.)

1583
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:55,052
That's absurd.

1584
01:00:55,052 --> 01:00:56,682
- We want you to go to a restaurant.
- You just have to wait.

1585
01:00:56,682 --> 01:00:58,081
- Ji Hyo was...
- But...

1586
01:00:58,081 --> 01:01:00,492
Wait. Waiting number 1001 is impossible.

1587
01:01:00,552 --> 01:01:02,552
- I mean...
- We were trying to be flexible.

1588
01:01:02,552 --> 01:01:04,861
You could let other people go first.

1589
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:08,032
(Go to a famous restaurant in Hong Kong, )

1590
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:10,762
(and get a waiting number of 1001.)

1591
01:01:12,061 --> 01:01:14,501
1001? Think about it.

1592
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:16,872
We should do something fun in Hong Kong.

1593
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:17,941
To get 1001,

1594
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,472
- we'll have to wait all day.
- It'll be so easy.

1595
01:01:19,472 --> 01:01:20,872
It'll be boring.

1596
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:22,472
It'll be so boring.

1597
01:01:22,782 --> 01:01:24,182
It already sounds boring.

1598
01:01:24,182 --> 01:01:26,452
(Team Land is in panic.)

1599
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:29,521
Get a waiting number, and eat noodles with an old lady.

1600
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,581
- What should we do?
- Then...

1601
01:01:31,682 --> 01:01:33,291
how about we wait in line every time we see a waiting line?

1602
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:34,492
About 100 times.

1603
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:35,852
- 100 times?
- Yes.

1604
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,961
Every time we see a waiting line, we have to get in.

1605
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,631
What about at bus stops?

1606
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:44,001
Get in every waiting line you see.

1607
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:45,762
Do we have a waiting line fetish?

1608
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:47,602
Get in every waiting line.

1609
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:50,671
They have to use the bathroom if there's a line there.

1610
01:01:50,802 --> 01:01:52,501
- Make sure they do.
- You have to use the bathroom?

1611
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:53,771
Yes.

1612
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:55,811
Every time we see a line...

1613
01:01:55,811 --> 01:01:57,881
- You have to get in the line.
- You have to wait in line.

1614
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,041
(Eat jjajangmyeon at Hong Kong Banjum.)

1615
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,282
(Share a strand of noodle with an old lady.)

1616
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:01,581
(Get in every waiting line.)

1617
01:02:02,282 --> 01:02:04,322
Missions for Team Island are problematic too.

1618
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:06,191
Let me read you one.

1619
01:02:06,421 --> 01:02:08,392
It's the mission given by the staff...

1620
01:02:08,751 --> 01:02:11,521
plus digging out 15kg of clams in 3 kinds.

1621
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,461
That sounds fun.

1622
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,432
Jong Kook is strong.

1623
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:16,561
It sounds fun?

1624
01:02:16,961 --> 01:02:19,061
You want to join?

1625
01:02:19,061 --> 01:02:20,932
No. I have to go to Hong Kong.

1626
01:02:21,231 --> 01:02:22,872
The next one is the real problem.

1627
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:25,271
- You have to find someone.
- Okay.

1628
01:02:25,271 --> 01:02:26,412
"Go to the island,"

1629
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:30,242
"find a Pyo who was born in May of 1943."

1630
01:02:30,242 --> 01:02:32,722
"He has to have curly hair, is blood type B, and is stubborn."

1631
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:35,481
"He should be handsome and have ingrown toenails."

1632
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:38,452
"He has to know at least 4 of your names in 5 seconds."

1633
01:02:38,452 --> 01:02:41,122
"You can't show him your name tags."

1634
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:42,651
Ingrown toenails?

1635
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,122
What's that?

1636
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:47,361
There are not many with that last name.

1637
01:02:47,361 --> 01:02:49,561
A blood type B born in 1943 would be hard to find.

1638
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:51,001
If we can't find him, what do we do?

1639
01:02:51,162 --> 01:02:53,072
Let's say we can't find him.

1640
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:54,872
- Are you getting upset?
- Get off of me!

1641
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:57,041
(Don't stop me.)

1642
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,702
- If we can't find...
- You have to find him.

1643
01:02:58,702 --> 01:03:00,872
What if we can't find him?

1644
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:03,811
What if no such person is registered at the district office?

1645
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:06,552
(What if no such person is registered at the district office?)

1646
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:08,512
You'd have to dig up graves.

1647
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:11,052
(Extreme)

1648
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:12,081
What do we do?

1649
01:03:12,691 --> 01:03:15,452
- I mean...
- What are you talking about?

1650
01:03:15,452 --> 01:03:16,662
(You're so extreme.)

1651
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:19,791
- Dig up graves?
- What are you talking about?

1652
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:22,392
We wouldn't be able to go any further.

1653
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:23,501
(Will this ever end?)

1654
01:03:23,802 --> 01:03:25,861
(Beat three brothers in yut with "mo" or "do.)

1655
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:27,972
(Pyo born in 1943 has to guess 4 of the members' names.)

1656
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:30,072
(Dig out 15 kg of clams in 3 kinds.)

1657
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,372
Missions for Team Land are hard too.

1658
01:03:32,372 --> 01:03:35,072
"At every rest area, park 10 SUV cars..."

1659
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,782
"in the order of..."

1660
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:39,452
"black, white, black, white, and blue."

1661
01:03:39,452 --> 01:03:42,581
(Park 10 SUV cars.)

1662
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:44,021
That's easy.

1663
01:03:44,151 --> 01:03:46,291
"Don't buy any food."

1664
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:47,291
(They can't buy any food.)

1665
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:50,662
"But if you are given walnut cakes, you can eat them."

1666
01:03:50,662 --> 01:03:53,162
(They can eat walnut cakes if they are given to them.)

1667
01:03:53,731 --> 01:03:57,361
If they receive fish-shaped buns, they can't eat them.

1668
01:03:57,361 --> 01:03:58,762
Only walnut cakes.

1669
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:01,532
The next one is a big problem.

1670
01:04:01,602 --> 01:04:03,271
"The mission given by the staff..."

1671
01:04:04,242 --> 01:04:06,472
"plus trying Korea's longest zip-line in Hadong."

1672
01:04:06,472 --> 01:04:10,811
(Staff's mission plus zip-line)

1673
01:04:10,811 --> 01:04:14,381
(Korea's longest zip-line)

1674
01:04:14,381 --> 01:04:15,412
- Korea's longest.
- That sounds fun.

1675
01:04:15,412 --> 01:04:17,421
That sounds like a penalty.

1676
01:04:17,981 --> 01:04:19,322
We were going to go there, right?

1677
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:21,791
Is that the one you were talking about?

1678
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,791
(That zip-line?)

1679
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,162
I saw it on TV.

1680
01:04:24,162 --> 01:04:27,532
(It all started from what Jae Seok said a few months ago.)

1681
01:04:27,532 --> 01:04:28,961
- Zip-line.
- Zip-line.

1682
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:32,501
(Asia's longest zip-line is in Hadong.)

1683
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:37,702
(I'm curious, but I'm too scared to try it myself.)

1684
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,941
Gosh, I'm so upset.

1685
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:42,242
It's supposed to be a penalty.

1686
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:45,282
I recently went to a suspension bridge.

1687
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,512
You should go.

1688
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:48,611
Didn't you do that on "Infinite Challenge"?

1689
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:50,322
- Yes.
- Why...

1690
01:04:50,322 --> 01:04:51,521
Don't talk about "Infinite Challenge".

1691
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:54,291
(Don't talk about "Infinite Challenge".)

1692
01:04:54,852 --> 01:04:57,162
Why would you talk about what you did on that show?

1693
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:02,162
- Why did you bring it up?
- Every week...

1694
01:05:02,162 --> 01:05:03,331
(I want you to try the zip-line.)

1695
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:04,702
It's making me sad.

1696
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:06,102
(I want you to try the zip-line.)

1697
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,532
Why are you mentioning another program here?

1698
01:05:08,532 --> 01:05:10,302
You should go.

1699
01:05:11,202 --> 01:05:14,342
(They feel foolish about the challenge.)

1700
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:16,182
(Choose one expressway, and try the best dish in every rest area.)

1701
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:17,912
(Do valet parking for 10 cars, and don't buy any food.)

1702
01:05:17,912 --> 01:05:19,792
(First mission plus longest zip-line in Korea.)

1703
01:05:19,881 --> 01:05:21,611
Team Land can pick first.

1704
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:23,921
The first mission is the best.

1705
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:25,122
(They'll choose 1 out of the 3 given missions.)

1706
01:05:25,122 --> 01:05:26,852
I know it is.

1707
01:05:26,921 --> 01:05:27,992
They picked one.

1708
01:05:28,052 --> 01:05:29,222
I'm worried.

1709
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:31,392
Please flip it toward us.

1710
01:05:34,892 --> 01:05:36,131
- Hey.
- Really?

1711
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:37,961
Gosh, no way.

1712
01:05:37,961 --> 01:05:39,102
(Screaming)

1713
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,102
What is it?

1714
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:42,032
Zip-lining.

1715
01:05:42,131 --> 01:05:44,872
(They picked zip-lining.)

1716
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:48,211
Oh, gosh.

1717
01:05:48,342 --> 01:05:50,242
I can't do it. You two do it.

1718
01:05:50,282 --> 01:05:52,811
- You two do it.
- Why did you pick?

1719
01:05:52,881 --> 01:05:55,682
- This isn't good.
- What are you going to do now?

1720
01:05:55,682 --> 01:05:58,122
We tried so hard so that we could avoid this.

1721
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,751
Why would we do this now?

1722
01:06:01,122 --> 01:06:02,251
- Kwang Soo.
- Yes.

1723
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:03,421
- Pick a good one.
- Okay.

1724
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:05,291
- Pick a good one, Kwang Soo.
- Kwang Soo.

1725
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:06,992
- Choose a thin one.
- I picked one.

1726
01:06:06,992 --> 01:06:11,102
(Kwang Soo is usually very unlucky. What did he choose?)

1727
01:06:12,162 --> 01:06:13,532
Okay!

1728
01:06:13,532 --> 01:06:15,001
- Okay!
- Okay! You did it.

1729
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:16,171
The mission by the staff.

1730
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:18,142
(He picks the mission suggested by the staff.)

1731
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,512
"Find three brothers and win in a game of yut."

1732
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:22,881
- Okay.
- That's so easy.

1733
01:06:22,941 --> 01:06:24,941
- We'll win Luxury Stickers.
- Yes, it's good.

1734
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:26,581
- Youngest.
- Ms. Detective,

1735
01:06:27,052 --> 01:06:28,182
pick one.

1736
01:06:28,182 --> 01:06:30,182
- Look at them first.
- Are you strong or weak?

1737
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:31,521
Trust your instincts.

1738
01:06:31,521 --> 01:06:33,622
- Middle one.
- Are you strong or weak?

1739
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,322
(Team Hong Kong's fate is up to Han Na.)

1740
01:06:35,822 --> 01:06:38,392
- Is it good? Come here.
- Your jacket is all over the place.

1741
01:06:38,392 --> 01:06:39,492
I hope it's the line one.

1742
01:06:39,492 --> 01:06:40,492
It'll be good.

1743
01:06:40,592 --> 01:06:41,892
- What is it?
- Hong Kong...

1744
01:06:43,602 --> 01:06:44,762
It's the line one.

1745
01:06:44,762 --> 01:06:46,032
This is what we wanted.

1746
01:06:46,032 --> 01:06:47,831
- This is not bad, right?
- Right.

1747
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:49,331
- That's what we wanted.
- Right?

1748
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:51,171
- Fine, this one's not bad.
- It's good.

1749
01:06:51,242 --> 01:06:52,401
It's good.

1750
01:06:52,401 --> 01:06:53,888
(At least we won't have to meet an old lady.)

1751
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:55,612
(Team Jae Seok must stand in line if there are more than 5 people.)

1752
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,281
(Team Jong Kook has to find three brothers and win a game.)

1753
01:06:57,281 --> 01:06:59,217
(Team Seok Jin has the staff mission plus longest zip-line in Korea.)

1754
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:01,052
How am I supposed to zip-line?

1755
01:07:01,081 --> 01:07:03,182
Why did you pick it then?

1756
01:07:03,182 --> 01:07:05,281
- You shouldn't have picked it.
- I know.

1757
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:07,052
Valet parking would be so easy.

1758
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:08,927
- I didn't pick it on purpose.
- We'll just be parking.

1759
01:07:08,951 --> 01:07:10,592
I didn't do it on purpose.

1760
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,621
- Gosh, this is driving me nuts.
- I didn't.

1761
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,531
- Do you want to go to the back?
- Okay, I will.

1762
01:07:14,531 --> 01:07:16,631
I didn't bring my backpack.

1763
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:18,461
- It's behind you.
- What?

1764
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:20,131
- It's on your back.
- It's behind me?

1765
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:23,142
- You're carrying it.
- You're carrying it.

1766
01:07:23,741 --> 01:07:24,871
What was that?

1767
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:26,871
- What happened?
- I didn't know I was carrying it.

1768
01:07:26,871 --> 01:07:29,142
Oh, gosh. You're unbelievable.

1769
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:31,411
(They hate zip-lining.)

1770
01:07:31,411 --> 01:07:32,541
I hate this.

1771
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,081
You know what? Sang Yeob...

1772
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:37,621
is going on the Shuddering Package for sure.

1773
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:39,421
Really?

1774
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,491
I still have one chance.

1775
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:43,392
- Not really.
- It's for sure.

1776
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,121
You're going on the Shuddering Package, so just do it.

1777
01:07:45,121 --> 01:07:47,892
Shouldn't you do it so that you can go on the Luxury Package?

1778
01:07:47,892 --> 01:07:49,232
- First game, - If I go on it...

1779
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,302
Majority Vote Game.

1780
01:07:51,302 --> 01:07:53,371
If I can go on the Luxury Package, I'll do it.

1781
01:07:53,371 --> 01:07:54,802
Point with your finger.

1782
01:07:54,902 --> 01:07:56,602
- In 1, 2, 3.
- 2, 3.

1783
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:58,701
- Okay.
- I know.

1784
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:00,871
I know it's me.

1785
01:08:01,571 --> 01:08:04,081
- Ji Hyo likes this type of thing.
- I don't.

1786
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:06,312
What do you mean? This is how people think of you.

1787
01:08:06,312 --> 01:08:07,381
- No.
- It is.

1788
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:09,312
When you jumped off the Macau Tower,

1789
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:11,682
- you were awesome.
- You looked so great.

1790
01:08:11,682 --> 01:08:12,821
I saw that too.

1791
01:08:12,821 --> 01:08:15,152
- Wasn't that great?
- Girl crush.

1792
01:08:15,152 --> 01:08:16,991
That was years ago.

1793
01:08:16,991 --> 01:08:18,791
- You're so old.
- So you should do it again.

1794
01:08:19,321 --> 01:08:20,892
How far away are we?

1795
01:08:21,562 --> 01:08:24,362
- We have 20km left.
- 20 minutes?

1796
01:08:25,631 --> 01:08:27,331
- 20km.
- 20km...

1797
01:08:27,331 --> 01:08:29,331
(Did he mishear it, or did he forget?)

1798
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:31,371
"We have 20 km left." "20 minutes?"

1799
01:08:31,772 --> 01:08:33,171
Have you ever held a car key...

1800
01:08:33,472 --> 01:08:35,411
in your hands then started looking for it?

1801
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,281
- I have.
- Right?

1802
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,012
I've done this too.

1803
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:41,381
I was walking and talking on the phone,

1804
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:43,722
and I was like, "I forgot my phone."

1805
01:08:43,722 --> 01:08:45,482
I went back home.

1806
01:08:45,482 --> 01:08:46,722
- You went back home?
- It's a disease.

1807
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,121
- It's not.
- You actually went home?

1808
01:08:48,121 --> 01:08:50,262
- I did go home.
- That's serious then.

1809
01:08:50,262 --> 01:08:51,838
The person I was talking to said this too.

1810
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:53,991
"Why didn't you bring your phone?"

1811
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,062
Really?

1812
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:57,161
That's insane.

1813
01:08:57,201 --> 01:08:59,001
- Who is this?
- That's insane.

1814
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:00,501
My brother.

1815
01:09:01,432 --> 01:09:03,071
(That's why they are family.)

1816
01:09:03,071 --> 01:09:04,171
Sung Moon?

1817
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:05,972
(That's why they are family.)

1818
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:10,112
Somebody I know...

1819
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,012
came back from his baby's birthday party...

1820
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:13,182
without his baby.

1821
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:16,081
(He didn't bring his baby back from the baby's birthday party.)

1822
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:18,682
(Who is this man?)

1823
01:09:18,682 --> 01:09:20,092
Seok Jin.

1824
01:09:20,092 --> 01:09:22,052
(It's Seok Jin.)

1825
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:23,892
"Hey, where's Hyun Woo?"

1826
01:09:24,562 --> 01:09:25,991
"Didn't you bring him, Mother?"

1827
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,362
It was me.

1828
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:29,262
"I thought you took him."

1829
01:09:29,531 --> 01:09:31,001
"Where's the baby, Soo Jeong?"

1830
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,201
"Oh, dear."

1831
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:34,131
"Where is he?"

1832
01:09:35,131 --> 01:09:37,102
Everybody is asking.

1833
01:09:37,102 --> 01:09:38,241
"The baby is gone."

1834
01:09:38,772 --> 01:09:40,671
(What if he goes on the zip-line without the rope?)

1835
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,191
It was my baby's first birthday party.

1836
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:45,182
This is really nice, right?

1837
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,911
- Yes, I feel relaxed.
- Right?

1838
01:09:47,911 --> 01:09:49,451
- It's close too.
- Right.

1839
01:09:49,722 --> 01:09:51,352
We just need to meet people.

1840
01:09:51,682 --> 01:09:54,052
- Once we find them, - That's it.

1841
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:55,121
We just need to play yut.

1842
01:09:55,652 --> 01:09:56,762
And...

1843
01:09:56,762 --> 01:09:58,562
I remember playing yut...

1844
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:01,631
with my family during Lunar New Year.

1845
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:03,331
My grandma...

1846
01:10:03,331 --> 01:10:05,631
got the highest point seven times in a row.

1847
01:10:05,631 --> 01:10:07,071
- Really?
- Really?

1848
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:10,371
- Is that hereditary too?
- I'm her grandson.

1849
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:12,171
When is Da Hee coming?

1850
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:15,312
She'll probably join us before the cruise leaves.

1851
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:16,342
I see.

1852
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:17,581
Who wants some jelly?

1853
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:19,612
(Jin Young brought some jelly to replenish sugar.)

1854
01:10:19,612 --> 01:10:20,781
Who wants some jelly?

1855
01:10:20,781 --> 01:10:23,081
- No.
- My sugar level hasn't dropped yet.

1856
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,152
We didn't eat that long ago.

1857
01:10:25,682 --> 01:10:28,222
Do you keep wanting... No, I'm okay. I'm fine.

1858
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:30,921
- Just take it.
- Eat some.

1859
01:10:30,921 --> 01:10:31,961
Okay.

1860
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:34,661
Kwang Soo. Use your hands.

1861
01:10:35,862 --> 01:10:37,862
(This is sad.)

1862
01:10:37,862 --> 01:10:39,631
- Okay.
- "Okay"?

1863
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:43,902
I think our mission will be easy,

1864
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,972
but the difficult part is...

1865
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:48,741
The important thing is...

1866
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,942
- How will Jong Kook...
- No.

1867
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:52,612
This...

1868
01:10:52,612 --> 01:10:54,092
How will he not be annoyed by Da Hee?

1869
01:10:54,612 --> 01:10:56,751
- That's your problem.
- No.

1870
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,321
- He'll get annoyed.
- That's not it.

1871
01:10:58,652 --> 01:11:01,652
We can do this mission while having fun.

1872
01:11:02,022 --> 01:11:03,892
But... But...

1873
01:11:04,291 --> 01:11:05,921
I might see that face again.

1874
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:07,362
(What if her angry side comes out?)

1875
01:11:07,362 --> 01:11:09,161
Da Hee has this face she makes.

1876
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:11,501
She's so nice, but she doesn't suit Jong Kook.

1877
01:11:12,262 --> 01:11:13,701
We have to pay attention.

1878
01:11:13,701 --> 01:11:15,802
(They drive for 15 minutes from Incheon Airport.)

1879
01:11:15,802 --> 01:11:17,541
This is the coast of Incheon.

1880
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:19,241
This is so nice.

1881
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:22,541
- The weather is so nice.
- How is this possible?

1882
01:11:22,541 --> 01:11:24,642
It was this sunny in New Zealand.

1883
01:11:24,642 --> 01:11:25,781
Jong Kook.

1884
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:28,751
You didn't pronounce "New Zealand" right.

1885
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:33,192
Jong Kook, can you not talk like a gangster?

1886
01:11:33,692 --> 01:11:35,751
What are you talking about? I'm not a gangster.

1887
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,092
Say, "Disney Land".

1888
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:38,321
Diesel Land.

1889
01:11:39,192 --> 01:11:40,531
"Diesel Land"?

1890
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:42,432
- This is so nice.
- I know.

1891
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:45,302
Da Hee couldn't join us in the introduction,

1892
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:47,131
- but she's here now.
- Is she here?

1893
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:49,232
- She must be so tired.
- I know.

1894
01:11:49,232 --> 01:11:50,501
- Da Hee.
- Da Hee.

1895
01:11:50,571 --> 01:11:53,612
- Because I'm your lady - There you are.

1896
01:11:54,142 --> 01:11:58,112
(It's like seeing a friend after 20 years.)

1897
01:11:58,112 --> 01:12:00,052
Hello.

1898
01:12:00,852 --> 01:12:02,451
- This looks so awkward.
- I know.

1899
01:12:03,321 --> 01:12:05,921
It must be tiring. She's shooting a drama.

1900
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,652
- Of course.
- For sure.

1901
01:12:07,652 --> 01:12:10,562
- Don't sound so fake.
- What?

1902
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:12,791
You sound like you're reading lines.

1903
01:12:12,831 --> 01:12:14,531
Do you know the rules for today?

1904
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:17,602
I heard the rules in the car.

1905
01:12:17,602 --> 01:12:19,402
- You heard?
- Yes, I know for sure.

1906
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:21,531
- You have to pay attention.
- It's yut.

1907
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:24,201
She pays more attention than anyone.

1908
01:12:24,272 --> 01:12:25,571
Don't you know?

1909
01:12:25,902 --> 01:12:29,071
- She focuses more than others.
- Yes, I can do it.

1910
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:30,581
You can't cross the line though.

1911
01:12:30,781 --> 01:12:32,442
If not, Jong Kook...

1912
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:34,581
- Your ambition...
- I know.

1913
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:36,451
He actually finds you uncomfortable.

1914
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:37,652
Me?

1915
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:38,921
I didn't say that.

1916
01:12:38,982 --> 01:12:40,427
- What are you talking about?
- He's so uncomfortable.

1917
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:41,692
- What are you talking about, punk?
- I...

1918
01:12:41,692 --> 01:12:44,062
I watched that episode.

1919
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,821
I didn't know I was like that.

1920
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:48,762
I almost crossed the line.

1921
01:12:48,762 --> 01:12:51,461
(I didn't know I was like that. I almost crossed the line.)

1922
01:12:51,461 --> 01:12:53,972
They actually edited it nicely.

1923
01:12:55,201 --> 01:12:57,571
If you say that, that makes me look more weird.

1924
01:12:57,571 --> 01:12:58,671
You did look weird.

1925
01:12:58,671 --> 01:12:59,871
(You know well.)

1926
01:12:59,871 --> 01:13:01,041
You're a very weird person.

1927
01:13:01,171 --> 01:13:04,012
I looked weird because you told me to see a doctor.

1928
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:05,812
I looked like I had mental problems.

1929
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:09,751
- You do have mental problems.
- I don't.

1930
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,821
(Quarreling)

1931
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:11,921
Why are you acting normally?

1932
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,751
My mom told me to cut down a bit. She said I was too weird.

1933
01:13:13,751 --> 01:13:16,121
- There's something going on.
- You look good together.

1934
01:13:16,121 --> 01:13:18,791
Why are you quarreling? Is this a lovers' quarrel?

1935
01:13:18,892 --> 01:13:21,732
- You are dressed like a couple too.
- That's right.

1936
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,331
They didn't talk to each other ahead of time, right?

1937
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:26,331
- They're dressed similarly.
- I know.

1938
01:13:26,331 --> 01:13:28,932
Jong Kook. You two are matching for sure.

1939
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:30,071
What?

1940
01:13:31,001 --> 01:13:33,112
- Why are you so black?
- You have eye boogers.

1941
01:13:33,272 --> 01:13:34,342
Hey.

1942
01:13:34,541 --> 01:13:35,571
Eye boogers.

1943
01:13:35,942 --> 01:13:37,982
(Is this a couples' race again?)

1944
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:40,451
Da Hee is really a bit like this. When she talks,

1945
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:42,352
- she does this.
- Like this.

1946
01:13:42,352 --> 01:13:43,581
She does this.

1947
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:45,552
"You did that."

1948
01:13:45,552 --> 01:13:47,652
"You did that, Jong Kook."

1949
01:13:47,652 --> 01:13:48,951
(Like this.)

1950
01:13:48,951 --> 01:13:51,491
(What is that?)

1951
01:13:51,491 --> 01:13:52,691
- Come here.
- It's different.

1952
01:13:52,732 --> 01:13:54,131
- Fine.
- You're so...

1953
01:13:54,232 --> 01:13:56,602
They're like Nam Cheol and Nam Sung Nam.

1954
01:13:56,602 --> 01:13:58,732
(They're like Nam Cheol and Nam Sung Nam.)

1955
01:13:58,732 --> 01:13:59,802
They get along...

1956
01:14:00,371 --> 01:14:01,432
very well.

1957
01:14:01,432 --> 01:14:03,102
(This duo has such great teamwork.)

1958
01:14:03,642 --> 01:14:06,512
It won't be easy to find three brothers on the island.

1959
01:14:06,972 --> 01:14:08,472
Won't there be three brothers though?

1960
01:14:08,512 --> 01:14:10,541
- I think so.
- It won't be easy.

1961
01:14:10,541 --> 01:14:12,781
What time is the last cruise?

1962
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,152
The last cruise is at 9:30pm.

1963
01:14:15,152 --> 01:14:17,352
- At night?
- If we fail, we can't come back?

1964
01:14:17,552 --> 01:14:19,692
It's tomorrow at 10am.

1965
01:14:19,951 --> 01:14:22,052
Back in the days, people tell you to go on dates...

1966
01:14:22,052 --> 01:14:24,821
on the islands.

1967
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:27,831
People used to say that. It's an old thing though.

1968
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:29,291
What year was that?

1969
01:14:29,402 --> 01:14:32,402
When I was young, I heard that somewhere.

1970
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:35,171
- So what year?
- I didn't have to go to an island.

1971
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,642
(Why would you go to an island?)

1972
01:14:36,642 --> 01:14:38,802
I was fine without going to one.

1973
01:14:38,802 --> 01:14:40,342
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

1974
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:43,612
Kwang Soo, this is Shinshimo Island.

1975
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:46,482
(Shinshimo Island? The cruise?)

1976
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,552
- Why are you changing the subject?
- No.

1977
01:14:49,552 --> 01:14:51,022
Kwang Soo needs it.

1978
01:14:51,652 --> 01:14:53,652
(He needs the power of the island.)

1979
01:14:53,652 --> 01:14:55,022
- What are you talking about?
- Kwang Soo...

1980
01:14:55,022 --> 01:14:57,392
- You two look good together.
- People do that.

1981
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:59,592
- What do you think?
- They look very good together.

1982
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,681
You two look even better. I'm serious.

1983
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:04,562
Everybody around me is rooting for you.

1984
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:06,602
- We look good together?
- You do.

1985
01:15:06,772 --> 01:15:07,972
I'm serious.

1986
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:09,772
Are you serious?

1987
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:10,942
- With this one?
- I'm serious.

1988
01:15:10,942 --> 01:15:12,501
- "With this one"?
- No.

1989
01:15:12,602 --> 01:15:14,241
I meant you and me.

1990
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:16,411
You don't like it?

1991
01:15:16,411 --> 01:15:18,482
That's not what I meant.

1992
01:15:18,482 --> 01:15:19,812
If they become a couple,

1993
01:15:19,812 --> 01:15:22,821
Jong Kook will lose 20kg in a month.

1994
01:15:22,821 --> 01:15:25,751
(Jin Young's love slave diet is very effective.)

1995
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,321
They kind of look like a college couple.

1996
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:31,562
- A college couple.
- Yes, I know what she means.

1997
01:15:31,722 --> 01:15:34,732
I keep looking at him, and this looks like my dad's jacket.

1998
01:15:34,732 --> 01:15:36,232
(What are you talking about?)

1999
01:15:36,232 --> 01:15:39,102
What are you talking about? This is not your dad's jacket.

2000
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:40,932
He's going on an island,

2001
01:15:40,932 --> 01:15:43,842
so he's dressed like the head of the village.

2002
01:15:43,842 --> 01:15:45,001
(He looks friendly and warm.)

2003
01:15:45,001 --> 01:15:46,411
He wanted to look friendly.

2004
01:15:46,571 --> 01:15:49,512
"It's the same jacket as mine."

2005
01:15:49,512 --> 01:15:50,512
(That was an unexpected attack.)

2006
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,612
He's like that.

2007
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:53,881
When it comes to fashion... Never mind.

2008
01:15:55,411 --> 01:15:56,482
Fashion?

2009
01:15:57,081 --> 01:15:59,621
Let's throw the yut, and the person with the lowest points...

2010
01:15:59,692 --> 01:16:01,212
will get hit in the head with the yut.

2011
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:03,762
Let's do it.

2012
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:06,331
We have the yut, so let's do it.

2013
01:16:06,331 --> 01:16:07,732
- Hey.
- Yes?

2014
01:16:07,732 --> 01:16:09,402
- Why would you do that?
- Let's do it.

2015
01:16:09,402 --> 01:16:10,762
- This is so funny.
- It'll be fun.

2016
01:16:10,762 --> 01:16:11,961
Why would you get hit in the head with the yut?

2017
01:16:11,961 --> 01:16:14,102
Your head might break. You have to control the power.

2018
01:16:14,272 --> 01:16:15,772
- With this.
- Just a tap?

2019
01:16:15,772 --> 01:16:17,241
- Let's do it.
- You can hit the head,

2020
01:16:17,241 --> 01:16:18,272
but not like this.

2021
01:16:18,272 --> 01:16:20,541
You can't use your entire arm. You can snap your wrist.

2022
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:22,041
- Deal. Let's do it.
- Deal.

2023
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:23,241
- Use your wrist.
- Let's do it.

2024
01:16:23,241 --> 01:16:25,041
- The person with the lowest point?
- Lowest?

2025
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:27,057
- You can pass with Do and Mo.
- What about Back Do?

2026
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:28,612
You can pass with Do or Mo?

2027
01:16:28,612 --> 01:16:30,251
- That's what we need.
- Okay.

2028
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:32,791
(Jong Kook is first to go.)

2029
01:16:32,791 --> 01:16:34,251
(He gets Gurl.)

2030
01:16:34,251 --> 01:16:35,821
- Gurl.
- That's in the middle.

2031
01:16:35,821 --> 01:16:37,262
Gurl isn't bad.

2032
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:40,092
Do is a pass, so Gurl is pretty high.

2033
01:16:40,092 --> 01:16:41,491
- It's pretty high.
- Yes.

2034
01:16:41,491 --> 01:16:43,531
(Jin Young is next.)

2035
01:16:43,531 --> 01:16:44,531
Jin Young.

2036
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:47,432
(Jin Young is next.)

2037
01:16:47,432 --> 01:16:48,972
(She gets Mo.)

2038
01:16:48,972 --> 01:16:50,842
You're so lucky.

2039
01:16:50,842 --> 01:16:52,541
(She's the new lucky one.)

2040
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,272
She's so lucky.

2041
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:57,512
- What should I do?
- She has a funny laugh.

2042
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,312
I kind of saw her.

2043
01:16:59,312 --> 01:17:01,451
Instead of raising it, you have to push it.

2044
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,451
(Push it sideways instead of throwing it up.)

2045
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:06,121
(She actually got Mo.)

2046
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,291
- You were serious.
- Just push it.

2047
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,921
- She found out?
- Push it.

2048
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:11,062
Just push it.

2049
01:17:11,062 --> 01:17:12,592
No, you have to throw it.

2050
01:17:12,592 --> 01:17:13,831
That's true. You do have to throw it.

2051
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:16,362
Women can do that, but men have to throw it.

2052
01:17:16,902 --> 01:17:20,071
(He still pushes them forward.)

2053
01:17:20,071 --> 01:17:22,232
(He gets Mo too.)

2054
01:17:22,232 --> 01:17:24,241
- Mo!
- Hey.

2055
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,411
- You have to throw it.
- Do you get hit in the head?

2056
01:17:26,411 --> 01:17:27,612
(Jong Kook gets the penalty.)

2057
01:17:27,612 --> 01:17:28,871
You have to throw it.

2058
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,741
Please take a good video of this.

2059
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:34,052
If I see him use his arm, I'm going to hit him 10 times.

2060
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:35,982
10 times. Which camera are you going to use?

2061
01:17:35,982 --> 01:17:37,982
Which one? Zoom in on his arm.

2062
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:40,552
- His arm...
- Look at his face.

2063
01:17:41,392 --> 01:17:42,961
If he moves his arm...

2064
01:17:42,961 --> 01:17:45,892
- You can't practice.
- No, that's not it.

2065
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:47,791
As soon as you move this, I'll hit you 10 times.

2066
01:17:47,791 --> 01:17:50,001
Okay. Let me practice once.

2067
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:51,961
(Let me practice once.)

2068
01:17:53,772 --> 01:17:56,041
(Hitting)

2069
01:17:56,402 --> 01:18:00,612
(That sounded like lumber.)

2070
01:18:00,942 --> 01:18:01,972
(Punching)

2071
01:18:01,972 --> 01:18:04,142
- I didn't move it.
- Hey.

2072
01:18:04,142 --> 01:18:05,812
You moved this much.

2073
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,381
You moved it.

2074
01:18:08,911 --> 01:18:09,921
(This much?)

2075
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:12,182
- I didn't move it.
- You're going to break his head.

2076
01:18:12,182 --> 01:18:14,451
It sounds like something is breaking.

2077
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:17,362
Isn't this much okay? I didn't move my arm.

2078
01:18:18,062 --> 01:18:19,762
I'm going to look at the camera.

2079
01:18:20,131 --> 01:18:21,192
Ready.

2080
01:18:21,432 --> 01:18:24,131
(He finally gets a chance. He can only use his wrist.)

2081
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:26,171
- Count down.
- Look at his face.

2082
01:18:27,232 --> 01:18:29,071
You need to count.

2083
01:18:29,071 --> 01:18:32,302
1, 2, 3.

2084
01:18:32,711 --> 01:18:35,112
(Hitting)

2085
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,342
(It's the sound of wooden percussion made with his wrist.)

2086
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:39,711
That sounded so loud.

2087
01:18:39,812 --> 01:18:41,081
Doesn't it hurt?

2088
01:18:41,852 --> 01:18:44,081
- We're here.
- We're here. Oh, dear.

2089
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,052
- That was clean.
- Hey.

2090
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:47,852
Let's do it again.

2091
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,522
- You moved it, right?
- No, I didn't.

2092
01:18:49,522 --> 01:18:50,562
- What?
- Sorry?

2093
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:52,222
Let's do it again.

2094
01:18:52,222 --> 01:18:53,392
Why?

2095
01:18:53,392 --> 01:18:54,862
- Are we here already?
- We arrived.

2096
01:18:55,531 --> 01:18:57,001
- It's over.
- Hold on.

2097
01:18:57,501 --> 01:18:59,732
- I think you're bleeding.
- I'm sure it hurt a lot.

2098
01:19:00,802 --> 01:19:02,131
That was so funny.

2099
01:19:02,501 --> 01:19:03,871
- Fine. Okay.
- Okay.

2100
01:19:08,112 --> 01:19:09,881
Give me the yut.

2101
01:19:11,281 --> 01:19:13,852
- Why did you do this?
- What?

2102
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:16,121
If you do this, you can hit harder.

2103
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:18,458
- That's true.
- You don't have to move your arm.

2104
01:19:18,482 --> 01:19:19,652
- Hey.
- No.

2105
01:19:19,652 --> 01:19:22,251
Look. You can do this.

2106
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:24,491
(You can hit it like this.)

2107
01:19:25,192 --> 01:19:26,862
You won't move your arm.

2108
01:19:27,592 --> 01:19:30,062
Why did you hit like this? I watched him...

2109
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,001
and wondered why he kept on doing this.

2110
01:19:32,102 --> 01:19:34,772
- You can't hit it hard.
- He looks ugly.

2111
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:35,902
If you do this...

2112
01:19:35,902 --> 01:19:37,342
- You look so ugly.
- Did it hurt?

2113
01:19:37,602 --> 01:19:38,701
Does it hurt?

2114
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,071
You should try it, jerk.

2115
01:19:42,071 --> 01:19:44,241
(You should try it, jerk.)

2116
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:48,112
(He expresses himself rather violently.)

2117
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:52,321
(They've never seen this on TV before.)

2118
01:19:52,791 --> 01:19:55,321
What do I do? The pain won't go away.

2119
01:19:55,592 --> 01:19:57,222
Why does it keep hurting?

2120
01:19:57,921 --> 01:19:58,921
It keeps on hurting.

2121
01:19:59,161 --> 01:20:01,732
What will you do?

2122
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:03,161
It's so painful.

2123
01:20:03,602 --> 01:20:06,232
The pain won't subside. What happened?

2124
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,501
(Everybody, this is how dangerous yut can be.)

2125
01:20:10,241 --> 01:20:12,272
We can't go to Hong Kong all of a sudden.

2126
01:20:12,272 --> 01:20:14,112
The flight is 3.5 hours.

2127
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:16,112
We can't go to Hong Kong right now.

2128
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:17,411
- Jae Seok, - This is a first.

2129
01:20:17,411 --> 01:20:19,312
Why did you stand in the yellow area?

2130
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:22,881
I said I would be there.

2131
01:20:22,881 --> 01:20:23,982
Why did you come?

2132
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:26,491
So Min is drawn to you like magnets.

2133
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:27,652
- No.
- To you.

2134
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,421
Jae Seok is always...

2135
01:20:29,421 --> 01:20:31,421
I think you and I had...

2136
01:20:31,421 --> 01:20:33,461
an ill-fated relationship in our past lives.

2137
01:20:34,092 --> 01:20:35,092
- You know what I mean?
- It was an ill-fated relationship.

2138
01:20:35,092 --> 01:20:38,432
- It was an ill-fated relationship.
- Was I a frog and you, a fly?

2139
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:41,031
(Did he get eaten by Frog So Min and was reborn as Jae Seok?)

2140
01:20:41,031 --> 01:20:42,631
Oh, gosh.

2141
01:20:42,631 --> 01:20:45,041
You two have a great chemistry.

2142
01:20:45,142 --> 01:20:48,541
You were a blow fly because you like colorful things.

2143
01:20:48,541 --> 01:20:50,442
Blow flies are colorful.

2144
01:20:51,612 --> 01:20:53,951
Are you going to let somebody younger than you say that?

2145
01:20:53,951 --> 01:20:55,658
(Let's go party in Hong Kong with the colorful fly Jae Seok.)

2146
01:20:55,682 --> 01:20:59,281
(Incheon to Hong Kong)

2147
01:21:00,852 --> 01:21:02,152
Look at this.

2148
01:21:02,352 --> 01:21:04,762
- I'm fascinated again.
- The weather is different.

2149
01:21:04,762 --> 01:21:05,892
Are we in Hong Kong?

2150
01:21:06,192 --> 01:21:07,932
It's kind of humid.

2151
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:09,192
- It's high.
- Right.

2152
01:21:09,192 --> 01:21:11,262
It's 70°C.

2153
01:21:11,631 --> 01:21:13,171
- 70°C?
- Really?

2154
01:21:13,371 --> 01:21:15,371
- No?
- I don't think it's that high.

2155
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,501
I looked at the weather.

2156
01:21:17,501 --> 01:21:19,411
So Min said this.

2157
01:21:19,442 --> 01:21:21,442
There was a screw on the ground,

2158
01:21:21,612 --> 01:21:23,142
so I joked and said, "Is this yours, So Min?"

2159
01:21:23,142 --> 01:21:24,612
She said, "No, it's Han Na's."

2160
01:21:24,612 --> 01:21:26,052
(Do you have a loose screw?)

2161
01:21:26,211 --> 01:21:28,852
(She tosses it to Han Na since she wasn't there.)

2162
01:21:28,852 --> 01:21:30,022
It's yours.

2163
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:32,751
She heard that and said this.

2164
01:21:32,751 --> 01:21:34,451
"I think she's so weird."

2165
01:21:34,552 --> 01:21:36,092
- "She's so weird."
- So Min...

2166
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:39,161
So Min is not normal.

2167
01:21:39,491 --> 01:21:42,961
They think they are compatible, but when they're not together,

2168
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:44,762
they talk about each other.

2169
01:21:45,062 --> 01:21:47,571
- They're no joke.
- They are not.

2170
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:49,472
We have arrived in Hong Kong.

2171
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:53,142
We only have four hours to film.

2172
01:21:53,142 --> 01:21:56,312
- Come on. This is driving me nuts.
- We can't finish the mission.

2173
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:57,342
We can't do it.

2174
01:21:57,342 --> 01:22:00,012
If you can't do it, you get 40 Running Balls.

2175
01:22:00,012 --> 01:22:02,722
We should have stayed in Korea then.

2176
01:22:02,722 --> 01:22:03,852
You picked those backpacks.

2177
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:06,652
Why did you pick it? You should have picked something else.

2178
01:22:06,652 --> 01:22:08,821
I picked it for myself.

2179
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:11,722
You chose the curtain and came to me.

2180
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:13,692
- We can't blame anybody.
- Right.

2181
01:22:13,692 --> 01:22:15,092
So...

2182
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:17,131
we have a car ready for you.

2183
01:22:17,131 --> 01:22:19,131
If you want to go somewhere, we'll take you there.

2184
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:21,932
- We have to go to Tsim Sha Tsui.
- It's the main street.

2185
01:22:22,001 --> 01:22:24,302
Let's go to the main street. We need to do the mission...

2186
01:22:24,302 --> 01:22:26,512
- In a crowded place? - where there are many people.

2187
01:22:28,112 --> 01:22:31,482
You all haven't been to Hong Kong.

2188
01:22:31,482 --> 01:22:32,911
- You haven't either.
- I've been here.

2189
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,581
Stop pretending like you know.

2190
01:22:34,581 --> 01:22:36,951
- I've been to Hong Kong once.
- This is driving me nuts.

2191
01:22:36,951 --> 01:22:39,081
- And...
- The flight attendant...

2192
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:41,821
didn't know what to do because of you.

2193
01:22:41,821 --> 01:22:44,062
- I asked for some information.
- And she fell asleep.

2194
01:22:44,062 --> 01:22:45,621
The flight attendant didn't know what to do.

2195
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:48,461
She asked if she should wake Han Na up, and I said no.

2196
01:22:48,562 --> 01:22:50,232
- I...
- She was sleeping like this.

2197
01:22:50,232 --> 01:22:51,961
She slept so prettily.

2198
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:54,772
I was wondering if there was a popular restaurant with a line.

2199
01:22:54,772 --> 01:22:56,602
I asked carefully.

2200
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,001
- Where is the paper?
- Where is it?

2201
01:22:58,001 --> 01:22:59,142
Hold on.

2202
01:22:59,142 --> 01:23:02,671
(Where is the paper? Hold on.)

2203
01:23:02,671 --> 01:23:03,682
It was in my pocket.

2204
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:06,211
Han Na, I don't expect too much from you.

2205
01:23:06,411 --> 01:23:08,411
- I don't expect too much.
- Goodness.

2206
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,628
(She's hopeless with her reasoning and collecting information.)

2207
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,621
- Look. You have to do this first.
- What?

2208
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:14,022
Is this the line?

2209
01:23:14,552 --> 01:23:15,791
- Look at you.
- Goodness.

2210
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,092
(He's spreading his wisdom in an arrogant tone.)

2211
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,461
It's loading.

2212
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,661
Is this the line?

2213
01:23:19,732 --> 01:23:21,031
What was that?

2214
01:23:21,232 --> 01:23:22,902
You can do this in Korea.

2215
01:23:22,902 --> 01:23:24,531
- Hold on.
- You have to do this in Korea.

2216
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:25,701
It works now.

2217
01:23:25,701 --> 01:23:27,131
Is this the line?

2218
01:23:27,631 --> 01:23:29,031
We have to know this.

2219
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:31,371
Did you see it? Are these two lines?

2220
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:32,842
This is driving me nuts.

2221
01:23:32,942 --> 01:23:34,772
- Two lines? - "Are these two lines?"

2222
01:23:34,772 --> 01:23:37,211
Your mouth looks weird, so it's not recognizing it.

2223
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:38,281
You should try.

2224
01:23:38,281 --> 01:23:41,911
I think I know how to say it.

2225
01:23:42,081 --> 01:23:43,121
What?

2226
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:45,152
(She was on a Chinese drama. Is she fluent?)

2227
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:46,628
What does that mean? "Is this the line?"

2228
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:49,291
It means to line up.

2229
01:23:49,421 --> 01:23:50,592
- Is that right?
- Or not?

2230
01:23:51,262 --> 01:23:54,131
I'll speak in Chinese, and it can translate it to Korean.

2231
01:23:54,131 --> 01:23:55,562
- That works.
- Try it.

2232
01:23:56,302 --> 01:23:58,862
(She speaks in Chinese.)

2233
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:04,102
- "This party..."
- "This party..."

2234
01:24:04,571 --> 01:24:06,371
This party is facing each other.

2235
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:08,442
What does that mean?

2236
01:24:08,442 --> 01:24:09,682
What happened?

2237
01:24:09,682 --> 01:24:11,142
- What's this?
- Where did you go?

2238
01:24:11,142 --> 01:24:12,312
- I mean...
- Whom did you hang out with?

2239
01:24:12,312 --> 01:24:14,052
- This isn't it.
- Let's stop.

2240
01:24:14,281 --> 01:24:15,381
Let's just line up.

2241
01:24:15,381 --> 01:24:17,182
(Forget it. Let's just line up.)

2242
01:24:17,352 --> 01:24:19,751
I'm getting tired. You're making me tired.

2243
01:24:20,121 --> 01:24:22,491
You started it. You asked about the line.

2244
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,991
- Are you getting mad at me?
- No.

2245
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:26,362
- It's kind of hot.
- She's mad.

2246
01:24:26,592 --> 01:24:29,631
- It's kind of hot.
- "It's kind of hot."

2247
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,701
It's kind of humid. Hold on.

2248
01:24:32,102 --> 01:24:35,031
So Min is in love with Jung Hae In.

2249
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:36,501
(She's in line to treat Hae In to a meal.)

2250
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:38,671
Her ideal man changed again.

2251
01:24:38,772 --> 01:24:40,211
When he smiles...

2252
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,671
- Is Han Na into him too?
- No.

2253
01:24:43,312 --> 01:24:45,012
When he smiles, he brightens up.

2254
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:46,411
- Right.
- His face brightens up.

2255
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:48,381
The screen brightens up when he smiles.

2256
01:24:48,381 --> 01:24:52,121
When we smile, does the screen get darker?

2257
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:53,592
- Does it?
- It's dull.

2258
01:24:53,592 --> 01:24:55,692
(It's not just dark.)

2259
01:24:55,692 --> 01:24:58,421
- Are we dull?
- It's kind of humid too.

2260
01:24:58,522 --> 01:25:01,031
- It's because of Se Chan.
- Is it?

2261
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:03,131
Why is it because of me? I'm so bright.

2262
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,802
- My gums show. It's so nice.
- Hey, don't be mistaken.

2263
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:07,932
You don't say these things when you are with Jong Kook, right?

2264
01:25:07,932 --> 01:25:10,001
- You are different.
- That mouth...

2265
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:11,842
You are different from Jong Kook.

2266
01:25:11,842 --> 01:25:14,571
Ask Jong Kook to open his eyes.

2267
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,012
(Jong Kook has small eyes.)

2268
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:19,081
I will die. He will beat me up.

2269
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:20,682
Seriously.

2270
01:25:20,682 --> 01:25:22,652
I am so happy that Jong Kook isn't here.

2271
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:25,222
I couldn't be happier. The atmosphere is relaxed.

2272
01:25:25,222 --> 01:25:26,522
Are you watching this, Kim Jong Kook?

2273
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:28,121
Are you watching this, Kim Jong Kook?

2274
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:29,222
Are you watching this? Watch yourself.

2275
01:25:29,222 --> 01:25:30,892
- Say some strong words.
- Whenever you are gone,

2276
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,961
- people are...
- People are cheerful.

2277
01:25:32,991 --> 01:25:35,131
You always wear black clothes.

2278
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:36,562
I will take this off later.

2279
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:38,201
Watch yourself, Kim Jong Kook.

2280
01:25:38,201 --> 01:25:39,201
- Are you watching this?
- Are you watching this?

2281
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:40,272
Are you watching this?

2282
01:25:40,272 --> 01:25:42,602
Han Na, say something. Say some strong words.

2283
01:25:42,602 --> 01:25:44,501
- I don't find him scary yet.
- Say something.

2284
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:46,112
What do you think about his fashion sense?

2285
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,842
What? It's not that great.

2286
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:49,581
(He only wears black.)

2287
01:25:51,041 --> 01:25:52,612
- Good job.
- He looks dark.

2288
01:25:52,612 --> 01:25:54,612
Good job, Han Na. That lightens my heart.

2289
01:25:55,182 --> 01:25:58,921
Please remove my audio.

2290
01:25:59,022 --> 01:26:00,052
My audio.

2291
01:26:00,092 --> 01:26:01,392
Are you telling the staff in advance?

2292
01:26:01,392 --> 01:26:02,722
Please remove my part.

2293
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:03,722
(Jong Kook is the best.)

2294
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:05,522
In that case, remove mine too.

2295
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:07,631
Don't use this scene.

2296
01:26:07,631 --> 01:26:09,131
- Cut!
- We filmed it.

2297
01:26:09,262 --> 01:26:13,272
- Remove scene 22 for Hong Kong.
- Cut!

2298
01:26:13,272 --> 01:26:14,632
(The scene is saved for eternity.)

2299
01:26:15,071 --> 01:26:16,071
(The bus runs.)

2300
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:17,642
- Tsim Sha Tsui.
- This is the place I know well.

2301
01:26:17,642 --> 01:26:19,812
I can be the guide here.

2302
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:22,112
Han Na, this is a good place to travel.

2303
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:24,411
- I want to sit in the terrace.
- It's really nice.

2304
01:26:24,642 --> 01:26:26,682
This is a good place to travel.

2305
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,682
(Accumulate 100 in queue numbers at Tsim Sha Tsui.)

2306
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:34,722
(Since there are many options for sightseeing, )

2307
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:37,862
(eating, )

2308
01:26:37,862 --> 01:26:42,092
(and playing, isn't success guaranteed?)

2309
01:26:43,001 --> 01:26:44,932
- The weather is really nice.
- The weather.

2310
01:26:45,432 --> 01:26:47,701
- It's nice.
- It's neither cold nor hot.

2311
01:26:48,272 --> 01:26:49,402
It's warm.

2312
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,302
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2313
01:26:51,302 --> 01:26:53,211
Hold on, don't look.

2314
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:54,312
All right.

2315
01:26:54,312 --> 01:26:57,581
- Look elsewhere. Look at the sky.
- The sky is clear.

2316
01:26:57,581 --> 01:26:58,942
(They don't want to waste time in a long queue.)

2317
01:26:58,942 --> 01:27:00,482
There are queues everywhere.

2318
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:02,082
Look elsewhere. Stare into the distance.

2319
01:27:02,312 --> 01:27:04,652
We must choose our queue wisely.

2320
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:07,821
Jae Seok, we must go that way. That way.

2321
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:10,222
- Calm down.
- I will calm down.

2322
01:27:10,222 --> 01:27:11,791
- Calm down.
- I will.

2323
01:27:12,062 --> 01:27:15,592
I have done shootings outside of Korea quite often.

2324
01:27:16,501 --> 01:27:18,701
- Okay?
- He hasn't done this.

2325
01:27:18,732 --> 01:27:20,571
He hasn't acted as a guide.

2326
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:22,571
- People are in a line!
- Gosh, you startled me.

2327
01:27:22,571 --> 01:27:24,802
- We have to line up.
- Over there.

2328
01:27:24,802 --> 01:27:29,911
(If there are many people, they can finish their mission soon.)

2329
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:34,911
(Can the queue in Tsim Sha Tsui help them?)

2330
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,522
- I thought they were people.
- That startled me.

2331
01:27:39,182 --> 01:27:40,592
Shouldn't we line up?

2332
01:27:40,692 --> 01:27:42,862
So Min, come here. We don't have much time.

2333
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:43,862
(So Min runs toward the sculpture.)

2334
01:27:43,862 --> 01:27:45,961
So Min, it's not a queue.

2335
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:48,932
I can't believe you. Come on.

2336
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,201
Line up.

2337
01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:53,071
- How many people are there?
- 10 people.

2338
01:27:53,071 --> 01:27:54,472
Shouldn't this count?

2339
01:27:54,472 --> 01:27:56,602
- It doesn't involve an experience.
- Shouldn't this count?

2340
01:27:56,602 --> 01:27:58,442
No, it shouldn't.

2341
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:01,512
Listen. Listen, Mr. Producer.

2342
01:28:01,671 --> 01:28:02,741
Listen.

2343
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,612
- There are 10 people.
- No, no.

2344
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:07,211
- No, no, - We can have an experience...

2345
01:28:07,211 --> 01:28:11,022
by posing like statues and taking a picture.

2346
01:28:11,022 --> 01:28:14,791
- What are you doing?
- I am giving an autograph.

2347
01:28:15,222 --> 01:28:16,621
My goodness.

2348
01:28:16,621 --> 01:28:17,692
(Han Na and So Min are uncontrollable.)

2349
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,791
- Is it a fan signing event?
- She is...

2350
01:28:21,892 --> 01:28:23,831
Come here.

2351
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:25,001
This should count.

2352
01:28:25,001 --> 01:28:26,571
I know. There are 10 people in the queue.

2353
01:28:26,571 --> 01:28:29,001
- No, you need real people.
- Real people?

2354
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:30,802
- Let's cross the road.
- Let's go.

2355
01:28:30,802 --> 01:28:32,402
This is nice.

2356
01:28:32,402 --> 01:28:33,411
(The main street is that way.)

2357
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:35,071
- My goodness.
- I can feel it.

2358
01:28:35,442 --> 01:28:37,211
- I remember this.
- That line...

2359
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:41,612
Jae Seok, there is a cafe where people line up.

2360
01:28:41,612 --> 01:28:42,612
- Really?
- Yes.

2361
01:28:42,612 --> 01:28:45,682
(Jae Seok sees a line for the bus.)

2362
01:28:46,522 --> 01:28:48,552
- There...
- Since you saw the line,

2363
01:28:48,552 --> 01:28:49,821
you have to line up.

2364
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:51,381
(It seems like the producer heard him.)

2365
01:28:51,491 --> 01:28:53,192
It's not like that.

2366
01:28:53,692 --> 01:28:56,701
- Wait, do we need to ride the bus?
- You saw the line.

2367
01:28:56,701 --> 01:28:57,902
Jae Seok, why did you see the line?

2368
01:28:57,902 --> 01:28:59,831
- It's not like that.
- Why did you do that?

2369
01:28:59,902 --> 01:29:01,071
- It's not like that.
- How many people are in the line?

2370
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:02,302
We need to get on it.

2371
01:29:02,302 --> 01:29:04,041
- How many people are in the line?
- 1, 2, 3,

2372
01:29:04,041 --> 01:29:05,902
- Hold on.
- 4, 5,

2373
01:29:05,902 --> 01:29:08,071
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

2374
01:29:08,071 --> 01:29:10,442
We were going to eat.

2375
01:29:10,442 --> 01:29:12,281
- 11 people.
- Why did you look at the line?

2376
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:13,682
I couldn't help but look.

2377
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:16,522
- What do we do?
- This is the main street!

2378
01:29:16,522 --> 01:29:19,592
(Se Chan is annoyed that Jae Seok looked at the line.)

2379
01:29:21,921 --> 01:29:24,692
(Where are we going?)

2380
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:25,961
Why did you look at it?

2381
01:29:26,192 --> 01:29:27,791
I didn't look.

2382
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:29,701
- Seriously.
- I didn't look.

2383
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:31,708
It just happened so suddenly. Hold on. Producer Cheol Min.

2384
01:29:31,732 --> 01:29:33,732
- Yes?
- You are so inflexible.

2385
01:29:34,102 --> 01:29:35,501
We were going to eat.

2386
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:38,171
I looked at it by chance. I didn't want to get in the line.

2387
01:29:38,171 --> 01:29:40,671
Like I said before, you must line up the moment you see the line.

2388
01:29:40,671 --> 01:29:42,472
I can't believe you. I told you, didn't I?

2389
01:29:42,842 --> 01:29:45,411
I told you to look at the sky! Why did you look at the line?

2390
01:29:45,411 --> 01:29:47,682
The trip might end after a series of bus trips.

2391
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,211
Suddenly,

2392
01:29:49,211 --> 01:29:51,581
- I was reminded of it.
- Okinawa?

2393
01:29:51,581 --> 01:29:53,421
I was reminded of Okinawa.

2394
01:29:53,451 --> 01:29:55,692
- Jae Seok, keep your mouth shut.
- Right, right.

2395
01:29:55,692 --> 01:29:57,022
Keep your mouth shut.

2396
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:59,102
- I should watch what I say.
- Keep your mouth shut.

2397
01:29:59,562 --> 01:30:01,732
(The mission of lining up in Hong Kong starts.)

2398
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:03,432
Is this the right place?

2399
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:05,807
(They are willing to go anywhere as long as there is a line.)

2400
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:08,831
(However, they get caught up in an incident.)

2401
01:30:08,831 --> 01:30:10,442
(Can they return safely from Hong Kong?)

2402
01:30:10,442 --> 01:30:12,442
(Team Island plays a game of yut.)

2403
01:30:13,972 --> 01:30:16,112
(However)

2404
01:30:16,112 --> 01:30:17,612
(The best player appears.)

2405
01:30:17,612 --> 01:30:20,112
(The best player's skills put them in a daze.)

2406
01:30:20,112 --> 01:30:22,381
(Even Jong Kook is defenseless.)

2407
01:30:23,421 --> 01:30:25,652
(Can Team Island complete their mission?)

2408
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:27,621
(A place that touches the sky)

2409
01:30:27,852 --> 01:30:28,852
We are in the air.

2410
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:31,592
(One man is suspended in the air.)

2411
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:33,291
My mind is blank.

2412
01:30:33,291 --> 01:30:35,432
(At this moment, )

2413
01:30:35,432 --> 01:30:37,461
(they don't feel like they are on a variety show.)

2414
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:39,001
(Also)

2415
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:43,102
(Luxury Package versus Shuddering Package)

2416
01:30:43,472 --> 01:30:46,911
(A round of the final decision makes them shudder.)

2417
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:49,642
(Who will end up where?)

2418
01:30:49,642 --> 01:30:52,012
(Family Project Final)
