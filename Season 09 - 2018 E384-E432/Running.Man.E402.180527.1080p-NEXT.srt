1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,910
(The refreshing energy of the early summer has dawned.)

2
00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:13,910
- Hey. - Hello. Hi.

3
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:15,580
- What are you doing? - Hello, Seok Jin.

4
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,695
- Hello. Hi. - Are you Baekgu, the white dog?

5
00:00:18,722 --> 00:00:20,690
- Eternity. - Hey, I get the feeling today...

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,990
- that we'll do a partner race. - Partner?

7
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:24,990
- It's a couple race. What was that? - A partner race.

8
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,260
- A partner race. Why? Why? - My gosh, that's a bit too...

9
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:28,660
- He might even say, "buddy". - A partner.

10
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:32,100
Just like you predicted, you will do a couple race today.

11
00:00:32,102 --> 00:00:33,630
(They haven't done a couple race for a while now.)

12
00:00:33,637 --> 00:00:35,670
(That's awesome! It's a couple race today!)

13
00:00:35,672 --> 00:00:37,300
These guys are ridiculous.

14
00:00:37,307 --> 00:00:40,370
You've never become a real couple. Why are you so happy about it?

15
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:43,170
Even so. You never know.

16
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,180
Young Jin, give me the cologne just in case.

17
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,010
(Young Jin is his personal stylist.)

18
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:49,580
- I need to spray some cologne too. - Why would you apply it?

19
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:51,150
Hey, just go with your natural smell.

20
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:53,920
- My gosh, unbelievable. - "Natural smell"?

21
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,720
- Natural smell? - Your expression is...

22
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:58,390
- too violent. - Your natural smell.

23
00:00:58,395 --> 00:00:59,520
- What is this? - Why? It smells nice.

24
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,990
- My goodness, come on. - Natural smell.

25
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:05,305
- You're talking nonsense. - Why would you bring that?

26
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,400
- My gosh, that's so lame. - He's really spraying it.

27
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:11,245
- Hey, the cologne... - What are you doing?

28
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,210
- My goodness. I can't believe it. - He really sprayed it?

29
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,570
- Hey, what's up with your pants? - Hey, hey. Punk.

30
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,310
- Young Jin. Young Jin. - Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,750
- Hey, come back here. - Hey, Young Jin. Give it back.

32
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:25,465
- If you want it, pass by. - You little punk. Hey.

33
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:27,490
If you want it, pass by.

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,090
(There's a stream of people.)

35
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:31,460
- You should've done it in advance. - My goodness.

36
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,035
Stop it!

37
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:34,575
(He sniffs it all of a sudden.)

38
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:35,990
(Spraying)

39
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,530
(This is mine.)

40
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,660
- It smells nice. It's nice. - This is nice.

41
00:01:39,669 --> 00:01:41,170
Hey, I like the smell.

42
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:42,430
Seok Jin is hilarious.

43
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,645
He stuck out his face as if it were a face mist.

44
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:47,810
Seok Jin doesn't know anything.

45
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:48,940
He really doesn't.

46
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,340
Let's welcome the guests one by one.

47
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:52,910
- Okay. - They will come right away.

48
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,155
- Here they come. - Here they come.

49
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:58,095
Who are they? Gosh, why did they show up first?

50
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,750
- Congratulations. - Okay.

51
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,220
(Their reactions tell you who the first guests are.)

52
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:05,165
(Ji Hyo and So Min walk forward without sparing a glance.)

53
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:07,760
- Welcome. - Take your positions.

54
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:11,030
- Take your positions. - All right.

55
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:12,530
Hello, So Min.

56
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,970
- Hello. - Hello.

57
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,030
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

58
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,100
(They greet each other dryly.)

59
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,170
Hello, hello.

60
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,870
- I am sure you have been well. - Yes.

61
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:20,870
Next!

62
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:22,710
(Haha cuts them off.)

63
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:23,810
Who is next?

64
00:02:23,813 --> 00:02:24,910
(Is that all?)

65
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,280
Let us talk some more.

66
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:28,080
The two of you are here, so it's time for the other guests.

67
00:02:28,084 --> 00:02:29,955
- Is that all? - Let's get this started.

68
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:34,695
(This song is...)

69
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:38,865
(The real guests of the day make an appearance.)

70
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:41,030
- AOA! - It's Seol Hyun!

71
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,130
- My goodness. - AOA!

72
00:02:42,132 --> 00:02:43,530
(Seol Hyun and Hye Jeong of AOA)

73
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:47,130
(AOA is the queen of summer with a new song, "Bingle Bangle".)

74
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:50,700
(Seol Hyun and Hye Jeong show talents in various fields.)

75
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,440
- My goodness. - It has been a while.

76
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,670
- It's Seol Hyun. - Hye Jeong is here as well.

77
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:56,510
- It has been a while. - Welcome, Hye Jeong.

78
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:58,555
It has been a while. It really has been.

79
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,880
- Hello. Hello, Hye Jeong. - My goodness.

80
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:03,150
- Do you know them? - I know Seol Hyun.

81
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:04,980
- We are like a family. - Stop it.

82
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:06,420
- 2, 3. Hello, we are... - Hello, we are...

83
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,835
- Ace of Angels, AOA. - Ace of Angels, AOA.

84
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,560
(They show an explosive reaction.)

85
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:13,220
Let's fly away!

86
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,335
- Let's fly away! - Come on!

87
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:16,960
- Let's fly away! - Come on!

88
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:20,200
Why did you swat my hands? I'm going to fly away.

89
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:21,570
- Go away. - All right.

90
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,300
Seol Hyun, you lost so much weight.

91
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,470
I work out these days.

92
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:25,770
- Really? - You work out.

93
00:03:25,775 --> 00:03:27,140
It's important to work out.

94
00:03:27,143 --> 00:03:30,280
You should be nice to So Min and Ji Hyo as well.

95
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
- Seriously. - Be nice to us.

96
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:34,050
- You haven't seen them in a while. - Show us a smile.

97
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,380
You can't compare with them in the slightest.

98
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,125
(Annoying)

99
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:40,890
(They prefer the guests over their family.)

100
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,495
Seriously.

101
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,865
Seol Hyun, tell me if you need anything for working out.

102
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:48,060
- Seriously. - This is incredible.

103
00:03:48,064 --> 00:03:49,260
Hey.

104
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:51,260
Kwang Soo, why are you acting strangely?

105
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:53,630
- There he goes again. - He said he was close to Seol Hyun.

106
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:54,970
- Well, - You aren't close to her.

107
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,300
- we are close. - He said he was very close to her.

108
00:03:56,306 --> 00:03:58,245
Seol Hyun and I had...

109
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,385
- a romantic subplot. - Don't be ridiculous.

110
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:02,810
(A romantic subplot between Kwang Soo and Seol Hyun?)

111
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:04,510
- You are wrong. - A romantic subplot?

112
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,710
- No such thing existed. - When she was here last time...

113
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:06,710
- You are wrong. - Tell them.

114
00:04:06,716 --> 00:04:08,050
- It was between Gary and her. - That's right.

115
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:11,295
When Gary and I were left, Seol Hyun chose me.

116
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:14,950
(3 years ago, they had the 2015 Christmas Special.)

117
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,790
(Seol Hyun was Gary's partner, )

118
00:04:17,794 --> 00:04:21,060
(but Kwang Soo confessed to her.)

119
00:04:21,064 --> 00:04:23,500
(What was Seol Hyun's answer?)

120
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,730
(Okay.)

121
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:29,230
(Kwang Soo beat Gary and became a couple with Seol Hyun.)

122
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:34,155
(It's a touching memory Kwang Soo will never forget.)

123
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,110
- Seol Hyun, don't you remember? - No.

124
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:37,625
She doesn't remember.

125
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:41,525
(Seol Hyun doesn't remember.)

126
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:44,580
He's a mythomaniac.

127
00:04:44,587 --> 00:04:45,680
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

128
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,220
You should stop. She doesn't remember.

129
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:49,990
- The memory's still very vivid. - Don't demand that she remembers.

130
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:51,905
- Also... - The rose.

131
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:56,335
Seol Hyun and Hye Jeong joined us. Let's meet the next guests.

132
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,960
(This song is...)

133
00:04:59,969 --> 00:05:01,315
What?

134
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,640
Hello, hello. It's Momoland.

135
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,100
Joo E, what is wrong with your eye?

136
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:07,685
Joo E and Da Young!

137
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:10,840
(Momoland has become popular with songs such as "Bboom Bboom".)

138
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,525
(Joo E has been on commercials thanks to her good cheer.)

139
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,725
(Da Young is a lead vocalist of WJSN who is as cheerful as Joo E.)

140
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:19,450
(They enter energetically.)

141
00:05:19,455 --> 00:05:21,290
What is that? What is wrong with your eye?

142
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,560
- What is wrong with your eye? - What is wrong with your eye?

143
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,290
- Hello. - What is wrong with your eye?

144
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,360
- All right. - Hello.

145
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:27,430
- Hello. - Hello.

146
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,490
- Hello. - Joo E.

147
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:30,575
I am sorry,

148
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,930
but what is up with your eye?

149
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:34,000
I have a sty.

150
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:36,600
- Do you have a sty? - I am sorry.

151
00:05:36,606 --> 00:05:38,385
Are you cosplaying Gung Ye?

152
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,340
She must be the first idol singer to do that.

153
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:43,255
She is the first idol singer to wear an eye patch to the shoot.

154
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:45,040
It's the first in the history of Running Man.

155
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:46,780
- She is wearing an eye patch. - No one has done that. It's unique.

156
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:48,210
- I like her character. - She makes us curious.

157
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,820
Will Joo E's partner wear an eye patch as well?

158
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,980
- What? - Will her partner wear...

159
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,150
- an eye patch? - It will be a couple's item.

160
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:55,120
- I am ready to wear it. - Really?

161
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:57,105
It's okay.

162
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:58,535
Joo E says it's okay.

163
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,005
I got rejected from the start.

164
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,130
Isn't it too cruel to reject me so soon?

165
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,775
That happened a bit early.

166
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,500
(Look forward to Joo E's performance today!)

167
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:07,800
Now,

168
00:06:07,804 --> 00:06:09,400
next to Joo E is...

169
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,770
Dong Yeob.

170
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,340
- Hello. - Dong Yeob.

171
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,310
- Hello. - Hello.

172
00:06:15,311 --> 00:06:16,815
(She is used to it.)

173
00:06:17,046 --> 00:06:18,310
My goodness.

174
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,940
- I wanted to say it. - She looks like Dong Yeob.

175
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:21,680
- Hello. - Hello.

176
00:06:21,684 --> 00:06:24,050
- Hello. - Stop it.

177
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,450
Da Young is here with us.

178
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:28,750
Will we have a couple race with four guests?

179
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,490
- Joo E, Da Young, and the others? - The numbers are perfect.

180
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:31,690
- The numbers are perfect. - That's right.

181
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:34,360
There are 6 men and 6 women right now.

182
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:37,900
- There are two more guests. - Really?

183
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,000
- Really? Why? - Are there more guests?

184
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,115
There are 6 men and 6 women right now.

185
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,200
That means there will be more men.

186
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,615
(At that moment, they hear a familiar song.)

187
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:50,210
- My goodness. - It's Winner!

188
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:51,240
It's Winner!

189
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,810
(Winner enters.)

190
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,225
This is great.

191
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,025
It will be fun.

192
00:06:57,654 --> 00:07:01,050
(The gangster of digital music sales, Winner)

193
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,890
(Min Ho and Seung Yoon visit Running Man at the same time.)

194
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:04,435
- It's Winner! - It's Winner!

195
00:07:04,661 --> 00:07:06,320
(My goodness, it's Winner!)

196
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:07,390
This is great.

197
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:09,935
(They show their swag through dancing.)

198
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,705
Seung Yoon.

199
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,100
Min Ho.

200
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:14,130
(Winner's appearance puts a damper on the male members' moods.)

201
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:15,570
Min Ho.

202
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,440
(I love the atmosphere today.)

203
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
- It's Min Ho. - Hello.

204
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:21,140
- Please come this way. - Their outfits are cool.

205
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:22,310
They are handsome.

206
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,110
- Goodness. - You should have called.

207
00:07:24,113 --> 00:07:25,780
- So Min. - They are...

208
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:28,080
- really excited. - We are set! We are set!

209
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,250
(Ji Hyo and So Min find their motivation.)

210
00:07:30,253 --> 00:07:31,450
You can't compare with them in the slightest.

211
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:33,520
- That's right. - This serves you right!

212
00:07:33,523 --> 00:07:35,220
You can't compare with them in the slightest.

213
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:36,850
- We know that. - Your skin is dull.

214
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,320
- Your skin is dull. - We know that.

215
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,160
- We acknowledge that. - You are dingy.

216
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:43,630
- We know we can't compare. - You know,

217
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,145
we thought we would have 6 men and 6 women for a couple race.

218
00:07:47,203 --> 00:07:48,930
We are getting a headache...

219
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,885
because the two of you joined unexpectedly.

220
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,970
- Why would you get a headache? - I'm having...

221
00:07:53,976 --> 00:07:55,540
- a headache. - Your path is set.

222
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,640
- Your partner is right here. - There will be a male couple.

223
00:07:57,647 --> 00:07:59,425
(Your partner is right here.)

224
00:07:59,682 --> 00:08:01,450
(He can't get away from Seok Jin, his soulmate.)

225
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,410
- Stop it. - I don't like you either.

226
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,420
- Stop it. - Don't be absurd.

227
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:07,090
- For goodness' sake. - Now...

228
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,390
Hold on.

229
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:09,620
So Min,

230
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,290
you are smiling from ear to ear.

231
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:12,490
No, I am not.

232
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:14,230
- Who is it today? - Who is it today?

233
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,430
- Who is it today? - When you smile brightly,

234
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:20,260
you look more like Han Min Kwan.

235
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:22,900
(You can see Han Min Kwan's face in So Min's face.)

236
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,770
I see Kwang Kyu. Kim Kwang Kyu.

237
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:28,315
- Kim Kwang Kyu. - Is this the Comedian Special?

238
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,940
- I am sorry. - We have Han Min Kwan...

239
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:31,780
- and Shin Dong Yeob. - Hello.

240
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:33,710
So Min resembles Kwang Kyu a lot.

241
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:35,655
- Kwang Kyu. - Kim Kwang Kyu.

242
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:38,980
Min Ho, you can laugh.

243
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:40,120
(She suddenly gives him a signal.)

244
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:43,150
- It must be Min Ho. - So Min is sending him a signal.

245
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,520
Why did you tell him that he could laugh?

246
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:47,290
He was stifling his laughter.

247
00:08:47,296 --> 00:08:49,360
So Min should have a nice day from time to time.

248
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:51,075
All right.

249
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:53,700
- Se Chan, you are sweating a lot. - Yes, I am. I am nervous.

250
00:08:53,703 --> 00:08:56,375
(He is sweating buckets.)

251
00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:59,015
I am nervous for no reason.

252
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,555
I hope one of the women will be my partner.

253
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:04,280
- All right. - That's why you are nervous.

254
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,110
Why does Se Chan look so small today?

255
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:07,610
Let's talk...

256
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:10,450
to the guests who have joined us for today.

257
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:12,780
Apparently, Min Ho is...

258
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:14,735
top one in his group when it comes to income.

259
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:16,720
- Really? - Min Ho is top one.

260
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:17,960
I guess he gets royalties.

261
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,660
His necklace tells me he spends a lot of money on himself.

262
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,575
It's genuine.

263
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,830
- It's genuine. - Really?

264
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,330
- That's incredible. - It's genuine.

265
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,970
Would you show it to us?

266
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,000
This is what it looks like.

267
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:30,475
(Embarrassed)

268
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:34,570
I thought it would be much longer.

269
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,070
That surprised me.

270
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:38,140
It's so short.

271
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:40,440
- That's the trend. - Min Ho,

272
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,510
I also thought it would be much longer.

273
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:44,280
I was surprised because it's so short.

274
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:46,080
- Long necklaces are tacky. - Short necklaces are in vogue.

275
00:09:46,088 --> 00:09:48,690
- That's the trend. - That's the trend.

276
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,820
- It should be snug. - Long necklaces are tacky.

277
00:09:49,826 --> 00:09:51,590
Aren't your earrings too big?

278
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:53,265
My ears are about to rip.

279
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,590
Isn't that Moon Hee Jun's style from back in the days?

280
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:57,605
I am certain Haha will wear those earrings next week.

281
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,745
He will wear bigger ones.

282
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,170
(They can already tell what Haha will wear next week.)

283
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,070
You know,

284
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:05,870
- about 10 years ago, - Good job.

285
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,340
- he tried to copy G-Dragon. - That's right.

286
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:10,925
These days, he tries to copy Min Ho.

287
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,740
Doesn't he look like he should be on "High School Rapper"?

288
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,150
(He doesn't even dress like Min Ho.)

289
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,380
- He copies Ha On. - Ha On.

290
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:17,865
He copies Ha On.

291
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,150
When did I do that?

292
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,695
Ha On is like 30 years younger than him.

293
00:10:21,824 --> 00:10:22,890
Come on!

294
00:10:22,892 --> 00:10:25,290
Why does he copy someone who is 30 years younger than him?

295
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:26,905
He is unbelievable.

296
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,530
He isn't 30 years younger than me.

297
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,700
(Haha can find his next fashion muse on "Einstein".)

298
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,630
Seung Yoon, how have you been? Winner's new song came out.

299
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:37,370
- I love it so much. - Tell us about the song.

300
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:40,215
Shall we watch a movie early in the morning?

301
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,570
Since you visited the show after a long while,

302
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,725
please dance for us.

303
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,250
- Please do that. - Let's see it.

304
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,650
- We have to see this dance. - That's right.

305
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:50,180
We have to see the Hammer Dance.

306
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,620
- Winner, let's go. - Let's go.

307
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,065
Let's get it!

308
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,635
(Her good cheer explodes.)

309
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,705
- I don't see the end - They'll start now.

310
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:07,475
(When they dance lightly, their swag explodes.)

311
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,770
(They are relaxed despite the difficult dance moves.)

312
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:11,900
They are fast.

313
00:11:11,908 --> 00:11:14,570
(Her heart flutters.)

314
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,770
(She becomes a fangirl.)

315
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,610
(Flapping)

316
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:20,710
Let's go!

317
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:23,025
(Here comes the Hammer Dance.)

318
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:27,420
This is it.

319
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:30,195
(The correct demonstration versus the wrong demonstration)

320
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:34,130
(Winner doesn't disappoint.)

321
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,590
- They are good. - They are cool.

322
00:11:35,598 --> 00:11:36,690
- That was nice. - They are cool.

323
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:38,200
- They are cool. - That was nice.

324
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,330
(Thanks to Winner, the atmosphere is lively.)

325
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:42,630
Now, it's Joo E and Da Young's turn.

326
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:44,170
(Da Young of WJSN and Joo E of Momoland)

327
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,370
Aren't you very close friends?

328
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:47,910
- Yes. - That's right.

329
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,910
We met once at a private event, and we became close afterward.

330
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:52,580
Where did you meet?

331
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,550
- It was in Gangnam. - We had shabu shabu in Gangnam.

332
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,880
- Did you eat shabu shabu? - Yes.

333
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:59,565
You shouldn't drink during the day already.

334
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:01,920
(He tries to slander them.)

335
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:04,335
No, we just turned 20.

336
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:09,460
"Bboom Bboom" is very popular these days.

337
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:10,960
Aren't you happy, Joo E?

338
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,645
- I'm very happy. - Right.

339
00:12:12,668 --> 00:12:15,170
- She's very happy. - I wasn't asking you to dance.

340
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:17,175
(She dances to the song.)

341
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:18,915
She likes to have fun.

342
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,770
- It's your first time on the show. - You're right.

343
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,810
- I'm very nervous and excited. - Now that you're on the show...

344
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:28,280
Really? Please answer when I ask.

345
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:30,395
- When... - She's so anxious.

346
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
She can't stay still.

347
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:33,820
- When I... - She speaks when Jae Seok speaks.

348
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,190
Please answer when I ask.

349
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:36,950
- I'm too nervous. - She sounds like a broken recorder.

350
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,420
- Are you nervous? - Yes.

351
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,565
You don't seem nervous at all.

352
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,990
- I'm very nervous. - Really?

353
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:46,330
Joo E and Da Young know each other.

354
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:48,530
Da Young is also known to be energetic.

355
00:12:48,537 --> 00:12:49,900
- Really? - She seems like it.

356
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,340
- That's right. - She has a special look.

357
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,445
Da Young is originally from Jeju Island.

358
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,010
- Come and visit Jeju Island. - Okay.

359
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,325
(Come and visit Jeju Island.)

360
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:01,250
Let's go.

361
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,680
(She makes an unrelated comment.)

362
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:05,620
When was the last time you went to Jeju Island?

363
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:08,320
I went there to dive recently.

364
00:13:08,324 --> 00:13:09,320
- "To dive"? - Yes.

365
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:10,820
- Did you dive? - Like a diver.

366
00:13:10,826 --> 00:13:12,820
- Did you go diving? - Yes.

367
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:15,430
- Really? - I went diving to catch murices.

368
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,345
My mom runs an eel restaurant.

369
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,100
Come to our eel restaurant, everyone.

370
00:13:21,103 --> 00:13:23,215
(Come to our eel restaurant, everyone.)

371
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:25,400
- There's a lot. - We'll come.

372
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:27,270
Is this some kind of an official gesture?

373
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:29,970
I'm sorry, but you shouldn't make advertisements.

374
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,010
- Okay. - All right.

375
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,925
- If you come, shrimp will be free. - Stop it.

376
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:36,610
- Stop it. What do you mean by that? - Sorry.

377
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,220
- Just come. - Goodness.

378
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,520
They are Hye Jeong and Seol Hyun of AOA.

379
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,195
(Hye Jeong and Seol Hyun)

380
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,960
- Hello, I'm Seol Hyun. - Hello, I'm Hye Jeong.

381
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:49,790
Seol Hyun often visited our show in the beginning of her career.

382
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,160
She made herself clear back then.

383
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,400
- "I like Joong Ki." - Right.

384
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,200
That's what she told us.

385
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:58,670
It's sad that Joong Ki got married.

386
00:13:58,674 --> 00:13:59,800
Whose fan are you now?

387
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:02,540
Now, I'm a fan of someone who isn't Korean.

388
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,840
- Is it a foreigner? - Who is it?

389
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:06,910
It's the actor in "Thor".

390
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:09,395
(Her ideal type is Thor.)

391
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,420
(It's understandable.)

392
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,190
- "Thor"? - He's handsome.

393
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,020
Jong Kook is Thor in Running Man.

394
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,335
- He's Thor in Korea. - He's our Thor.

395
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:19,990
Is he Chris Hemsworth?

396
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:21,490
Yes, it's Chris Hemsworth.

397
00:14:21,497 --> 00:14:24,200
- I like Thor. - I was startled when...

398
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,460
- she brought up Cream Sam Sauce. - What did you say?

399
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:28,145
Cream Sam Sauce.

400
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:29,500
"Cream Sam Sauce"?

401
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,000
- What kind of sauce is it? - Cream Sam Sauce.

402
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:34,770
- Worth, Chris Hemsworth. - Right.

403
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:36,870
- Is it silkworm? - It's delicious.

404
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,010
Is there a reason why you like Chris Hemsworth?

405
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:42,310
I fell in love with him after watching the movie.

406
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:43,450
- Yes. - It can't be helped.

407
00:14:43,452 --> 00:14:45,920
- You'd fall in love with Kwang Soo. - In "Collective Invention"?

408
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:47,920
If you watch him in "Collective Invention"...

409
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,390
- Why do you keep mentioning that? - You were a fish.

410
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:52,435
He was a fish for two hours.

411
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:53,890
He's without a head or a tail.

412
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:55,260
- Right. - By the way...

413
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:56,890
- He was a rockfish. - Was it...

414
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,060
- a rockfish or a carp? - It was a rockfish.

415
00:14:59,068 --> 00:15:01,430
- Wasn't it a halibut? - It was a rockfish.

416
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:04,645
- Shut it, you all. - Wasn't it a halibut?

417
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,270
- That's not important. - It was another type of fish.

418
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:09,370
It wasn't a halibut. Halibuts are flat.

419
00:15:09,378 --> 00:15:14,780
- Some called it a Korean bullhead. - "Korean bullhead"?

420
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,910
- What do you mean? It wasn't. - Wasn't it a Korean bullhead?

421
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:18,320
- No. - It was a monkfish.

422
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,720
- It was a monkfish. - Monkfish are flat.

423
00:15:20,723 --> 00:15:22,935
I love that movie, so stop it!

424
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:24,590
(They make fun of "Collective Invention" again.)

425
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:27,090
We also have Hye Jeong with us.

426
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:28,330
(It's time to meet Hye Jeong.)

427
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,875
She's also modeling for jeans.

428
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:34,170
She shows them off.

429
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:37,640
There are ways and poses...

430
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,200
- to make the jeans look good. - Yes.

431
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:44,070
You can lift up your buttocks a little.

432
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,510
Like this?

433
00:15:45,514 --> 00:15:48,180
Raise one foot slightly.

434
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,050
- Do you lift it a little? - Slightly.

435
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:51,550
- Do it toward the camera. - But...

436
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:53,450
It hurts a lot.

437
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:55,790
- I bet it does. - When you pull it up,

438
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,060
your buttocks can look more voluptuous.

439
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,160
It's a know-how.

440
00:16:01,163 --> 00:16:02,560
- As Hye Jeong said... - Do it toward the camera.

441
00:16:02,565 --> 00:16:04,560
Don't you also do a lot of modeling, Seol Hyun?

442
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,000
- Her full-size posters disappeared. - What?

443
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:09,800
- What? - "Full-size posters"?

444
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:11,300
- Full-size posters. - What are they?

445
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:12,800
They got stolen for a while.

446
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:15,340
- He means a standing signboard. - "Standing signboard"?

447
00:16:15,344 --> 00:16:17,370
He's a full-size poster.

448
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,680
- Me? - Kwang Soo...

449
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:20,110
- He's one of them. - Am I a full-size poster?

450
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:21,780
- He is. - I'm a full-size poster?

451
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:23,450
They're small and large full-size posters.

452
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:25,050
- Small and large full-size posters. - Why?

453
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:26,450
(Small and large full-size posters)

454
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,795
Why are you calling me that? Wait a minute.

455
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,660
- I didn't do anything. - They're large and small.

456
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,165
Why am I a poster?

457
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:35,430
Goodness.

458
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:39,175
AOA released a new song recently.

459
00:16:39,568 --> 00:16:41,570
- It's been a long time. - We've been waiting for long.

460
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,430
It took a long time.

461
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,400
- Right. - It's been a year and a half.

462
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:46,715
Really?

463
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,370
- Why? - We should take a look.

464
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:50,170
What's the title of your new song?

465
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,085
- The title is "Bingle Bangle". - "Bingle Bangle".

466
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,625
"Bingle Bangle".

467
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:56,895
Here it comes.

468
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,235
(Shake your bottoms.)

469
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:07,365
- There it is. - Look at the dance.

470
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:10,035
(It's already addicting.)

471
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,475
Do you know the song?

472
00:17:13,535 --> 00:17:14,945
They dance well.

473
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:16,870
Goodness.

474
00:17:16,872 --> 00:17:19,015
They make the same movements again.

475
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:22,055
(The younger singers are impressed.)

476
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,125
("Bingle Bangle" is a song that will cool down the summer.)

477
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:31,125
What are you doing?

478
00:17:32,054 --> 00:17:33,820
(Her leg slides.)

479
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:34,850
What are you doing?

480
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:36,520
(It's perfect to the end.)

481
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:37,960
That's was so sudden.

482
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,705
I think she just made that up.

483
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,260
- It's the original choreography. - It's original.

484
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:45,400
(Everyone is in a daze.)

485
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:48,245
- That looks difficult. - It could be dangerous.

486
00:17:48,637 --> 00:17:50,870
- Why did she do that suddenly? - That was amazing.

487
00:17:50,873 --> 00:17:53,170
(They struggle to copy Seol Hyun.)

488
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:55,555
- What's wrong, So Min? - What's wrong with them?

489
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,470
- Goodness. - What are you doing?

490
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,810
You're not flexible.

491
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,440
(You'll get used to it after 9 years.)

492
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:03,580
Today's race has a golden ring on the line.

493
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:05,350
It's called Zombie Couple Race.

494
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,650
- "Zombie"? - "Zombie"?

495
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:08,320
- "Zombie Couple Race"? - "Zombie Couple"?

496
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:12,165
There are two contagious zombies...

497
00:18:12,194 --> 00:18:15,775
who can turn humans into zombies.

498
00:18:16,498 --> 00:18:19,200
There's one vaccinated human...

499
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:21,470
who can turn zombies into humans.

500
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,000
(There's one vaccinated human.)

501
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:28,310
If your partner is a contagious zombie, you turn into one as well.

502
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,470
(You become a zombie when your partner is a zombie.)

503
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:33,080
The winning couple obtains a chance to exchange partners...

504
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:35,980
and hints about the contagious zombies and the vaccinated human.

505
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,555
The contagious zombies...

506
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,020
and their partners stay as zombies.

507
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,650
If a zombie is partnered with the vaccinated human,

508
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:47,860
they become a human again, so choose your partners wisely.

509
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:50,630
What if a contagious zombie is partnered with the vaccinated human?

510
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:51,960
Nothing happens.

511
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,700
(Nothing happens.)

512
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:56,370
In the final round, if the vaccinated human...

513
00:18:56,372 --> 00:18:59,915
eliminates both of the contagious zombies, Team Humans wins.

514
00:19:00,776 --> 00:19:03,840
If the contagious zombies eliminate the vaccinated human,

515
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:06,055
Team Contagious Zombies wins.

516
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:08,510
If everyone becomes a zombie...

517
00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,225
except for the vaccinated human, Team Contagious Zombies wins.

518
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:17,290
(Identify the contagious zombies before everyone turns into them.)

519
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,290
Before we start the race,

520
00:19:19,294 --> 00:19:21,560
you must choose your partners.

521
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:24,400
You'll choose your partners by playing Heart Signal.

522
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,460
(Heart Signal)

523
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:27,830
- "Heart Signal"? - What is it?

524
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,130
A female member comes out with music.

525
00:19:30,139 --> 00:19:32,740
She sends a heart-shaped signal while dancing.

526
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:34,810
The male members who want to become her partner...

527
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,370
will come out and dance with her.

528
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,510
On the count of three, both of the members...

529
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,310
will make a heart.

530
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:44,920
The one who makes the same shape as the female becomes her partner.

531
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,980
Thank goodness.

532
00:19:45,988 --> 00:19:48,450
There's a variety of heart shapes.

533
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:49,990
You can make different kinds.

534
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:52,420
1 couple will be 2 men.

535
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:53,420
- Right. - That's a pity.

536
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,660
If you don't want to become partners...

537
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:58,260
with some of the male members, you can make strange shapes.

538
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,730
- That's right. - You can do that.

539
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:01,800
Goodness.

540
00:20:01,804 --> 00:20:02,830
(He's nervous.)

541
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:04,130
It's a mental game.

542
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,285
Why are you pretending to be nervous? It'll be easy for you.

543
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,585
- Really? - Yes.

544
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,225
Why are you being so serious?

545
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:14,040
Don't be so serious.

546
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,680
We're just partners for the day. That's unnecessary.

547
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:17,880
(Heart Signal starts.)

548
00:20:17,886 --> 00:20:21,935
All right, everyone. Let's choose our partners.

549
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,890
Hye Jeong will start first.

550
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:25,120
- Me? - Yes.

551
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,705
- Okay. - Okay.

552
00:20:27,196 --> 00:20:28,630
- Good luck. - I'll start.

553
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,900
It helps if you give us hints.

554
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,260
It won't be confusing.

555
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:35,600
I won't be pathetic. I'll step out only once.

556
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,200
- Don't be pathetic. - Just once?

557
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:40,070
- I won't step forward many times. - Me neither.

558
00:20:40,075 --> 00:20:41,570
- I'll go out once. - Me too.

559
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:44,485
- I'll step out once. - I'm a valuable man.

560
00:20:45,214 --> 00:20:46,710
Please play the music.

561
00:20:46,715 --> 00:20:48,450
(Music starts for the valuable men.)

562
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,195
- Please start. - Why is it so slow?

563
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:52,520
Right?

564
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:56,820
(Her dance movements are slower.)

565
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:57,890
(She makes a heart signal.)

566
00:20:57,893 --> 00:20:59,590
Is that your signal?

567
00:20:59,595 --> 00:21:00,860
- Just once. - Right?

568
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,875
(That's the shape.)

569
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:05,645
- That's her signal. - Is this it?

570
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,300
That's right.

571
00:21:07,302 --> 00:21:10,570
(She sends her signal directly to Kwang Soo.)

572
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:14,285
(Did you just pick me?)

573
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,170
Shall I go now?

574
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:18,340
Men, please go out.

575
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:20,040
(The men step out.)

576
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:24,780
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan come forward slowly.)

577
00:21:24,786 --> 00:21:27,425
What's going on? Which heart shape should I make?

578
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,290
Look at them.

579
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:32,120
(Hye Jeong's signal is mine.)

580
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:33,390
The flies are out.

581
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:35,860
- The flies are out. - They are out.

582
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,505
- The flies are out. - It's a fruit fly and a dung fly.

583
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:42,145
(Buzzing)

584
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:44,100
(The fly brothers flutter their wings to win her heart.)

585
00:21:44,106 --> 00:21:47,145
- You said you'd try just once. - Let's go.

586
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,170
On the count of three, please make a heart sign.

587
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,625
What should I do? I think she sent me a signal.

588
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,210
- One... - I think she gave you...

589
00:21:57,219 --> 00:21:58,720
- I can make the sign now, right? - a sign.

590
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,490
- One... - Haha is joining.

591
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,750
(After saying he'd step out once, Haha joins the fly brothers.)

592
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:06,165
(He said he wasn't easy.)

593
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:08,730
1, 2, 3.

594
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,090
(Everyone makes a heart sign.)

595
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:16,545
(Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong become a team.)

596
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,815
(That was it?)

597
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:24,740
Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong are a team.

598
00:22:24,746 --> 00:22:27,110
(Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong become the first team.)

599
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:29,955
- Let's do well. - Please come here.

600
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:32,320
- I hope one of them is a zombie. - Next...

601
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:33,480
(Jealous)

602
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:37,020
- "I hope one of them is a zombie"? - You said you'd step out only once.

603
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:39,520
- What are you doing? - Don't say mean things.

604
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:42,790
- Don't say mean things. - It hurts every time.

605
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,275
- Now, it's So Min's turn. - Okay.

606
00:22:47,636 --> 00:22:49,300
- So Min. - All right. Let's see it.

607
00:22:49,304 --> 00:22:51,845
- So Min. - So Min.

608
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,210
This is just a game. Why are you blushing?

609
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,185
Why am I blushing? It's strange.

610
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,280
I'm just hot.

611
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:02,010
- Please play some music. - Please join me.

612
00:23:02,017 --> 00:23:03,010
Min Ho should try.

613
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,820
(What's this song?)

614
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,325
What's this song?

615
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:07,720
Let's go!

616
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:11,390
(It's So Min's theme song.)

617
00:23:11,393 --> 00:23:14,035
This... We should do this.

618
00:23:14,096 --> 00:23:15,990
We have to do this.

619
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:18,575
(She gives up.)

620
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,400
(So Min gives up and starts to show off her charms.)

621
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:24,575
Isn't anyone joining her?

622
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,840
(She signals, but no one comes.)

623
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:28,170
No one is joining her.

624
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:29,840
(She signals, but no one comes.)

625
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:31,585
No one wants to go. What should we do?

626
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,485
- Someone please join her. - No one wants to.

627
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,950
(Lonely)

628
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:39,965
(It's Min Ho.)

629
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:44,250
(Min Ho joins after watching quietly.)

630
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,720
(Swag)

631
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:47,235
Min Ho...

632
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,375
He's so cool.

633
00:23:49,564 --> 00:23:50,830
(Min Ho is the best.)

634
00:23:50,832 --> 00:23:52,345
He's amazing.

635
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:54,505
Will no one else come out?

636
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,100
Is it only me?

637
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:58,900
No one else? 1, 2...

638
00:23:58,907 --> 00:23:59,900
(They both make a heart sign.)

639
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:00,940
Three.

640
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,470
(So Min and Min Ho become a team.)

641
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:05,855
What is this?

642
00:24:06,515 --> 00:24:08,480
Min Ho is an angel.

643
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:11,920
Let's move on. It's Da Young's turn.

644
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,420
- We should try. - Let's get it.

645
00:24:14,423 --> 00:24:15,920
Da Young... She took her shoes off.

646
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:18,290
(She takes her shoes off.)

647
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:19,565
Her shoes...

648
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,790
- Was that really necessary? - She's too much.

649
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:24,760
- She's too much. - It's Da Young's turn.

650
00:24:24,766 --> 00:24:28,170
I'll try only once. Okay.

651
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,770
What I did with Hye Jeong doesn't count.

652
00:24:29,771 --> 00:24:30,830
(It doesn't count.)

653
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,200
- It doesn't count? - She's sending me a signal.

654
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,300
Please give us some music.

655
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:36,010
(Da Young's Heart Signal)

656
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,310
- I wanted a song like this one. - She starts right away.

657
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:39,310
But that song suited you better.

658
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:42,225
- What is she doing? - I wanted a song like this.

659
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,025
Is that a heart?

660
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,320
- We can't do that. - She's going to do that?

661
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:47,620
Show us something else.

662
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:48,620
(There's this one too.)

663
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:49,935
Hey.

664
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:52,365
- What is that? - Don't do that!

665
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:56,675
(Do you want us to do that?)

666
00:24:58,834 --> 00:24:59,830
Haha, it's you.

667
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:01,800
(Haha, will you join me?)

668
00:25:01,803 --> 00:25:03,600
(Sure, if you want me to.)

669
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,540
Haha is in.

670
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,015
Just let them be a team.

671
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,455
Come on.

672
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:11,185
Wait.

673
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:16,595
(Jae Seok does a dirty heart dance.)

674
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,695
(Haha is on the alert.)

675
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:20,580
She's giving you a sign.

676
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,250
(Whom is she signaling to? Jae Seok or Haha?)

677
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:24,090
All right. 1, 2...

678
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,165
(Whom is she signaling to? Jae Seok or Haha?)

679
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,200
(Haha and Da Young become a team.)

680
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,730
- Jae Seok got turned down. - It's been a while.

681
00:25:36,738 --> 00:25:40,385
(Jae Seok loses to Haha.)

682
00:25:41,143 --> 00:25:42,910
That was easy.

683
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:45,180
- I beat Jae Seok. - All right.

684
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,210
This is Haha's Running Man.

685
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:49,650
I didn't want to join anyway.

686
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,820
It shouldn't count because my heart wasn't moved.

687
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,620
- What are you talking about? - My heart...

688
00:25:54,623 --> 00:25:56,590
- You even lied down. - My heart wasn't in it.

689
00:25:56,591 --> 00:25:59,335
- What are you talking about? - I'll erase it from my memory.

690
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:01,505
Next up is...

691
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,675
- Seol Hyun! - Seol Hyun.

692
00:26:05,367 --> 00:26:07,600
- Hold on. - Hold on.

693
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,600
- Hold on. - Get out of my way.

694
00:26:09,604 --> 00:26:11,700
- It's fierce. - Seol Hyun...

695
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:13,800
- We all have to try. - We have to.

696
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:14,940
Please give us some music.

697
00:26:14,943 --> 00:26:17,915
(The competition is already fierce.)

698
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:21,285
(Crowded)

699
00:26:21,917 --> 00:26:23,550
(Even Min Ho wants to join.)

700
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:25,480
- That looks cool. - We have to try.

701
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:28,290
Min Ho, where are you going?

702
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,990
- I want to dance. - Why are you joining?

703
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,905
I just like the song.

704
00:26:32,027 --> 00:26:34,065
Seol Hyun, give us a sign.

705
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,260
- Look at his smile. - That looks so fake.

706
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,875
- It's disgusting. - Seriously.

707
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:43,000
Please make different kinds of hearts.

708
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,300
- That's the heart. - Oh, that's it.

709
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:48,885
(That must be it.)

710
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,110
- Give us a sign. - Oh, that must be it.

711
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:55,310
(It might be this one too.)

712
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:57,280
- What is it? - Which one is right?

713
00:26:57,285 --> 00:27:00,120
- Which one? - Which one is right?

714
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:04,635
- This one? - 1, 2, 3.

715
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:09,830
(I hope we'll make the same sign.)

716
00:27:09,831 --> 00:27:13,075
(Jong Kook and Seol Hyun become a team.)

717
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:15,300
(The competition was fierce.)

718
00:27:15,303 --> 00:27:17,215
(Happy)

719
00:27:18,173 --> 00:27:21,085
(Exhilarated)

720
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:26,210
Jong Kook looks so happy.

721
00:27:26,214 --> 00:27:29,680
Seol Hyun is the same.

722
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:32,050
- She looks too happy to be a team. - So what?

723
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,795
- It shows too much. - I am happy.

724
00:27:34,823 --> 00:27:40,360
- I'm better than the other two. - Don't say that.

725
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:43,160
- Don't you think? - You never know.

726
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,260
I think it worked out for the best.

727
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:46,545
(It had to be Jong Kook.)

728
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,975
- I admit it. - I feel so sorry.

729
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:53,845
(The fierce Heart Signal is over.)

730
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:58,070
(Couple Matching Result)

731
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,780
Everyone, couples have been formed.

732
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:03,610
Let me tell you how many zombies there are right now.

733
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,780
At the moment...

734
00:28:05,787 --> 00:28:07,620
(They started out with two contagious zombies.)

735
00:28:07,622 --> 00:28:09,690
(How many zombies are there right now?)

736
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,750
There are four zombies.

737
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,690
(There are two more zombies now.)

738
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:13,960
That many?

739
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:15,160
(That means...)

740
00:28:15,163 --> 00:28:17,290
The contagious zombies must have become a team with humans.

741
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,005
- They must have become a team... - Right.

742
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:21,900
- with humans. - There are four zombies right now.

743
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:25,315
After changing, we'll start the race.

744
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,640
- Let's go. - Let's go.

745
00:28:27,642 --> 00:28:30,385
(The Zombie Couple Race starts.)

746
00:28:30,946 --> 00:28:32,225
Amazing.

747
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,655
Please come here.

748
00:28:34,983 --> 00:28:38,520
(Everyone, check this out.)

749
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,150
(So Min is borrowing Min Ho's golden necklace.)

750
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:44,290
- Look at this. - Look at that swag.

751
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:45,790
Stop it, you two.

752
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:47,290
(Swag, my foot.)

753
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,260
Because So Min got a necklace,

754
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:52,660
Seol Hyun is regretting her team choice.

755
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:53,945
(Seol Hyun is regretting.)

756
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:56,270
No. I'm just borrowing it.

757
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:59,300
- Seol Hyun must like shiny things. - Shiny things?

758
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:01,500
- That looks cool. - Don't lose it.

759
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,210
- So Min... - It doesn't look good on her.

760
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:05,310
Do that again.

761
00:29:05,313 --> 00:29:06,910
(So Min is gesturing.)

762
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:08,910
- Gosh. We're shooting. - What?

763
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:10,110
You shouldn't do this.

764
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:13,595
(Don't make that gesture.)

765
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:15,420
It suits her.

766
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:18,290
(Kwang Soo is making it look like So Min made a smoking gesture.)

767
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:19,590
But So Min does this.

768
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:20,590
(Haha chips in.)

769
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:21,905
That's right.

770
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,790
She's caught.

771
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:26,100
To win hints about the contagious zombies and the vaccinated human...

772
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:28,200
and to change your partners, you have to win the first mission.

773
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:32,170
It's called Cosmic Charm Bboom Bboom Every Day Heart Attack.

774
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,570
(Cosmic Charm Bboom Bboom Every Day Heart Attack)

775
00:29:33,575 --> 00:29:36,040
- It's all in there. - Cosmic Charm Bboom Bboom...

776
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,670
Bboom Bboom Heart Attack.

777
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,380
- You're going to... - Hold on.

778
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:42,510
So Min. I'm sorry but...

779
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,580
- What is it? - Seriously.

780
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:48,390
During your short conversation, you were doing this so many times.

781
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:50,550
(She wants to look cute.)

782
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,005
- When you talk to us... - She did it again?

783
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:56,160
(Earlier, Min Ho was explaining the meaning of the game title.)

784
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:58,930
(So that's what it meant. I had no idea.)

785
00:29:58,933 --> 00:30:01,600
- You're doing it so many times. - What's with you?

786
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:03,445
- Stop it. - Stop it.

787
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:06,670
- It's not like that. - That's how it all starts.

788
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:09,040
The winner of each round will win points.

789
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:12,010
The team with the most points will win the race.

790
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:15,610
- Okay. - First, it's an impression quiz.

791
00:30:15,617 --> 00:30:17,210
(Impression Quiz)

792
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:18,820
- An impression quiz? - An impression quiz?

793
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,795
- That sounds difficult. - An impression quiz?

794
00:30:21,623 --> 00:30:24,590
The winner will get 10 points. For 60 seconds,

795
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:27,190
the team members will take turns...

796
00:30:27,195 --> 00:30:29,090
mimicking a person or a thing.

797
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:32,075
The team that gets more questions right will win.

798
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,500
- I'm not good at it. - So Min is going to win.

799
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:37,170
- So Min is a professional. - She's amazing.

800
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:39,570
She can mimic many people. Min Ho, are you good at it?

801
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:41,400
- I heard he's good. - He's really good.

802
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:42,710
- He's good? - Yes.

803
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,410
- He's the best in our group. - Really?

804
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,480
- We're the strongest team. - This is going to be fun.

805
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:50,310
- He's really good. - Who should start?

806
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:52,520
We want to start.

807
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,695
- So randomly? - He must a zombie.

808
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:57,590
- He's a zombie. - Why would I be?

809
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,920
- That was so random. - He wants to be a human.

810
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,790
Why do you want to start?

811
00:31:01,796 --> 00:31:02,990
I can do it later.

812
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:05,200
(If you're going to mock me like this, I'll do it later.)

813
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,460
- Why? - You must have a reason.

814
00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:09,000
- No? - He wants to do it later.

815
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:10,300
I mean... What?

816
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:14,740
All right. Let's start from Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong.

817
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,085
(They're allowed to go first.)

818
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:18,710
- There are two zombie couples. - Ready.

819
00:31:18,713 --> 00:31:20,010
Start.

820
00:31:20,014 --> 00:31:24,055
(Hye Jeong has to mimic An Young Mi.)

821
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,050
- Ready. - They're going to take turns.

822
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,380
(An Young Mi?)

823
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:28,665
Start.

824
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:31,890
What's with you? That startled me. What's that?

825
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:35,475
(That's a very energetic dance.)

826
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:38,090
- That's... - That's accurate.

827
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:41,705
- That's very accurate. - That's on point.

828
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,800
- My gosh! - Don't you know this move?

829
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,300
- An Young Mi. Okay. - Right.

830
00:31:45,306 --> 00:31:46,740
(He gets it correct.)

831
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,340
- Okay. - That was spot on.

832
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:50,370
(It's Han Gi Beom.)

833
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,110
- Come on. - It's just him.

834
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:54,710
(It's him again?)

835
00:31:54,716 --> 00:31:57,025
(Fine. I'll do his impression.)

836
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,880
(He doesn't need to impersonate him. He looks just like Gi Beom.)

837
00:31:59,888 --> 00:32:02,365
- I can't remember his name. - She doesn't know.

838
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:04,150
- It's his doppelganger! - She doesn't know.

839
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,860
- No, he isn't! - It's your doppelganger!

840
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,035
- She said they look alike. - They look alike.

841
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,775
- It's his lookalike. - They look alike.

842
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:11,805
- All right. - You look just like him.

843
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,900
(He looks like the younger version who used to rule the courts.)

844
00:32:13,902 --> 00:32:16,100
- He looks just like that guy. - This is easy.

845
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:17,530
- It's his lookalike. - You look like him.

846
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,770
- Pass? - Pass, pass.

847
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:19,900
It's your lookalike.

848
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,200
(She fails since she can't remember his name.)

849
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:24,355
(The next keyword is pressure rice cooker.)

850
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,940
(Pressure rice cooker? I can handle this.)

851
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,450
Wait, I'm sorry. Hold on.

852
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,855
(He accidentally says the brand.)

853
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:33,380
- Wait, I'm sorry. Hold on. - What was that?

854
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,290
You can't say the name of the brand.

855
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,650
- What is this? - I'm sorry.

856
00:32:36,658 --> 00:32:38,050
- You can't do that. - I'm sorry. It just came out.

857
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,290
- This isn't fair. - I'm sorry.

858
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:41,965
- Rice cooker! Rice cooker. - This won't count.

859
00:32:42,764 --> 00:32:44,590
(Since he cheated, it won't count. Their 60 seconds are up.)

860
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:45,600
We got many of them right.

861
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,930
- That was Han Gi Beom. - That's right!

862
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:51,200
- He looks just like Gi Beom. - No, I don't. What? No.

863
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,940
- She said they looked alike. - Next up are...

864
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:55,570
So Min and Min Ho.

865
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,110
- Let's do this. - Let's get it.

866
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:58,585
- Swag. - It's lovey-dovey couple.

867
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,925
- It's lovey-dovey couple. - Swag.

868
00:33:00,982 --> 00:33:03,210
I can't help but walk like this...

869
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:04,655
after meeting Min Ho.

870
00:33:04,719 --> 00:33:06,050
- We can do it. - We can do it.

871
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,395
Get ready.

872
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:08,650
Start.

873
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:12,735
(So Min will explain first. The keyword is Choi Min Sik.)

874
00:33:13,628 --> 00:33:16,830
- "You. You punk." - Choi Min Sik.

875
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:18,600
(Choi Min Sik is the right answer.)

876
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,330
"Can you see the bullet wound here?"

877
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,330
Lee Jung Jae.

878
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:25,385
(I can pull this off too.)

879
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:27,245
Did you guys prepare this?

880
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:29,215
This one is difficult.

881
00:33:30,178 --> 00:33:32,040
(So Min's keyword is Song Kang Ho.)

882
00:33:32,046 --> 00:33:33,580
What was that? I can't remember his line.

883
00:33:33,581 --> 00:33:34,810
What was that?

884
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:38,180
"Hey, I'm number 3. Number 3."

885
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:39,420
(The actor never said this line.)

886
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,950
- "Hey, this is..." - Song Kang Ho.

887
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:45,065
(However, he manages to figure it out.)

888
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,060
- He's good. - That wasn't the line.

889
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:48,190
(How did you answer that?)

890
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:50,130
- You can flip the page. - He's so good.

891
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,630
(Kang Ho Dong is a comparatively easier keyword.)

892
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,900
"Seung Gi!"

893
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,730
(This one is easy.)

894
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:55,800
Lee Sang Yeob.

895
00:33:55,803 --> 00:33:58,300
(What? Why is this Sang Yeob?)

896
00:33:58,306 --> 00:33:59,440
(It's incorrect.)

897
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,970
- Sang Yeob? - It's wrong.

898
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:02,340
- Why would you say Sang Yeob? - What did you say?

899
00:34:02,343 --> 00:34:04,085
- Why? - That came out of nowhere.

900
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,640
My gosh, you two...

901
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,310
(Min Ho's keyword is bidet which is a difficult one.)

902
00:34:09,317 --> 00:34:11,250
- They are really good. - This one is amazing.

903
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:14,265
(It won't be easy. How will Min Ho describe a bidet?)

904
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,490
(Pressing a button)

905
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:19,160
(Moaning)

906
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,660
(Why does it look sexual?)

907
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:22,830
Bidet!

908
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:26,545
(Bidet is correct.)

909
00:34:27,235 --> 00:34:29,130
- What's happening? - That was really good.

910
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:30,475
- That was awesome. - My gosh.

911
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,800
- The last impression was good. - I mean...

912
00:34:31,806 --> 00:34:33,970
- He did it with only one move. - They're currently in first place.

913
00:34:33,975 --> 00:34:35,140
It's Min Ho and...

914
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:36,310
(So Min and Min Ho answers 4 questions.)

915
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:37,670
I've never been in first place.

916
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,540
Next up are Ji Hyo...

917
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:41,180
- and Seung Yoon. - Seung Yoon.

918
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:43,655
- Seung Yoon, you look nice. - We should just have fun.

919
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:45,010
Get ready.

920
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,650
- Let's just have fun. Okay. - I'll start.

921
00:34:46,654 --> 00:34:47,950
Start.

922
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:52,035
(Seung Yoon's first keyword is Yang Hyun Suk.)

923
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:54,060
(It's my label's CEO. I can do this.)

924
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:55,390
"Well, you know..."

925
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,805
"Our Winner..."

926
00:34:58,466 --> 00:34:59,875
That sounds similar.

927
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:02,900
(Zoning out)

928
00:35:02,904 --> 00:35:04,430
Song Min Ho.

929
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,870
(She calls out Min Ho's name.)

930
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,070
(It's incorrect.)

931
00:35:08,076 --> 00:35:09,210
- That's Min Ho? - Min Ho?

932
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,470
(She's clueless while Min Ho is speechless.)

933
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,880
- She doesn't know. - She doesn't know.

934
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,080
- She has no idea. - Try to answer it right.

935
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:15,980
- Why? - That's incorrect.

936
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,280
- She doesn't know him. - That's wrong.

937
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,480
- Pass. - He'll try now.

938
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:20,120
(Seung Yoon's keyword is Yoo Ah In.)

939
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:25,265
(It's his famous line from "Veteran", "I can't believe it.")

940
00:35:26,394 --> 00:35:28,360
(This is too easy.)

941
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:29,390
(Yoo Ah In)

942
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:33,105
(She doesn't know this one either.)

943
00:35:34,035 --> 00:35:35,370
- Hey, this is... - You should get it right away.

944
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,570
- You should've gotten it already. - How can you not know this?

945
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:40,315
- I just can't remember it. Wait. - I really can't believe this.

946
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:41,985
I really can't believe this.

947
00:35:43,511 --> 00:35:45,015
My gosh, this is too easy.

948
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,980
- How could you not know this? - Yoo Ah In.

949
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,650
(She barely manages to figure it out.)

950
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,680
(Ji Hyo's keyword is Lee Byung Hun.)

951
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:54,280
My gosh, how do I explain this?

952
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:55,720
(This is hard.)

953
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,950
I can't do this. Give me a second.

954
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,050
(You can do the massage with the prosthetic arm.)

955
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,805
Hey, do this. This.

956
00:36:01,129 --> 00:36:03,960
(It's one of the best scenes from "Inside Men".)

957
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:07,530
(Byung Hun gives a massage with his prosthetic arm.)

958
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:09,300
- Hey, do this. This. - There's a lot you can do.

959
00:36:09,303 --> 00:36:11,230
- My gosh, this is... - There's a ton you can do.

960
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,600
(She lifts her arm like this...)

961
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:19,510
(Is she sawing?)

962
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:20,780
What? You're sawing, Ji Hyo?

963
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:22,040
- That's not right. - What was that?

964
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,610
- Why would you saw it? - To be honest...

965
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:27,120
(We don't know what she's sawing, but she fails to describe him.)

966
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,395
- You're not sawing anything. - That's wrong.

967
00:36:29,457 --> 00:36:31,520
- To be honest, I don't know this. - We'll pass this.

968
00:36:31,526 --> 00:36:33,665
- I don't know. - "Why did you do it?"

969
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:35,775
(He sings "Instinctively".)

970
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:37,490
- "Like It". - "Like It".

971
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:38,560
- It hurts - Right. "Like It".

972
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,960
- I should've sung that. - It hurts

973
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,130
Start.

974
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,600
(Haha and Da Young's first keyword is Park Myung Soo.)

975
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:44,700
"Let's go."

976
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:45,800
- Jung Jun Ha. - No.

977
00:36:45,807 --> 00:36:47,170
(What?)

978
00:36:47,175 --> 00:36:48,470
(Incorrect)

979
00:36:48,476 --> 00:36:49,510
That was incorrect.

980
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,310
- "Let's go." - He's flustered.

981
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:52,810
That was incorrect. That was wrong.

982
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:54,455
(The next keyword is Gung Ye.)

983
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,910
- She might not know this one. - "I can't see with one of my eyes."

984
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:00,580
(He puts on an eye patch.)

985
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:02,080
(Time is up.)

986
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,350
Why? What's wrong?

987
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:05,705
- Why? Why? - It's over.

988
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:07,020
(The keyword is Yoon Kye Sang.)

989
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:08,160
- This is hard. - This is...

990
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,605
"Where are you from?"

991
00:37:10,965 --> 00:37:12,230
- "Where are you from?" - That line!

992
00:37:12,233 --> 00:37:13,845
"Must I know your name too?"

993
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:16,345
Pass.

994
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:18,800
The way she passed the question was so cool.

995
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:20,470
(He's impressed.)

996
00:37:20,475 --> 00:37:22,670
- This is so cool. - "I won't give it up."

997
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:23,940
(The keyword is Kim Hee Ae.)

998
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:25,780
Pass.

999
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,840
(She looks the coolest.)

1000
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:27,880
- That was a good impression. - That was good.

1001
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,450
- Why am I getting angry? - She doesn't know anything.

1002
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,995
If you answer this, it'd be amazing.

1003
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:35,120
(The keyword is window. She makes wiping noises.)

1004
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,690
- Window! Okay. - Yes!

1005
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,220
- People open and wipe the window. - She opened it.

1006
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:39,835
- She wiped it in the air. - Right.

1007
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:44,005
(It's Seok Jin and Se Chan's turn, but the keyword is Namgung Ok Boon.)

1008
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:46,430
At times, I think of you

1009
00:37:46,434 --> 00:37:48,030
- I think of you - Park Haki.

1010
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,075
(Incorrect)

1011
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:51,570
Park Haki?

1012
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,440
(Only Seok Jin knows this old keyword.)

1013
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,640
Hold on a second. Hold on.

1014
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,855
- Kim Serena. - Wait a second.

1015
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,880
Aren't these historical people?

1016
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,510
- Aren't they historical people? - Right now, Joo E...

1017
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:01,710
This is all that I can do.

1018
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:03,350
(Since Se Chan doesn't know them, they answer 0 question.)

1019
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:04,910
This is too much.

1020
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:07,595
- Jong Kook and Seol Hyun are next. - Is it our turn?

1021
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:09,450
- Come on. - Okay.

1022
00:38:09,457 --> 00:38:10,850
- I really suck at this. - Come on, come on.

1023
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,265
Seol Hyun will start.

1024
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:13,635
Start.

1025
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:16,460
(What's Seol Hyun's first keyword?)

1026
00:38:16,464 --> 00:38:18,675
How do I do this impression? I forgot.

1027
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,530
You can forget all you want. Keep going. It's okay.

1028
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,830
(He's kind only to Seol Hyun.)

1029
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,130
"Mister, mister."

1030
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,900
(Wait, this is...)

1031
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,070
- She did everything. - That's right.

1032
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,970
- It's impossible not to know. - This is just a giveaway.

1033
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:31,370
- This is the basic impression. - Everyone does this impression.

1034
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:32,825
- "Mister"? - "Mister, mister".

1035
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:34,180
"Mister"?

1036
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:35,510
(It's Ok Hui from "My Mother and Her Guest".)

1037
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:36,680
- Everyone does this impression. - Right.

1038
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:38,080
(I know what it is.)

1039
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:39,520
It's the one with Ho Dong...

1040
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
- I don't know this one. - My gosh.

1041
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:41,980
You don't know this one?

1042
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,295
(Why don't you know this one?)

1043
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,635
- Jong Kook will definitely get it. - What?

1044
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:48,690
(This is Jong Kook's favorite item, the blender.)

1045
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,135
- That's right. He has to know. - What?

1046
00:38:50,898 --> 00:38:51,990
- Is it a helicopter? - He has to know.

1047
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,260
You don't know this one?

1048
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,700
(I got it. If it whirs...)

1049
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:57,100
Mosquito. Mosquito, mosquito.

1050
00:38:57,104 --> 00:38:59,140
(I got it. If it whirs, it's a mosquito.)

1051
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,340
- That's wrong. - Mosquito repellent.

1052
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:01,785
Mosquito?

1053
00:39:01,976 --> 00:39:03,540
(He only thinks of mosquitoes since he's teased for his high voice.)

1054
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:06,010
- You only think about mosquitoes. - Mosquito? Mosquito?

1055
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,210
It's your best friend.

1056
00:39:07,214 --> 00:39:09,250
- You stay with this the longest. - It's Jong Kook's best friend.

1057
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,650
- It's your best friend. - Every day.

1058
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:11,980
I see. The blender.

1059
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,320
(He finally answers it right.)

1060
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,580
(We barely managed.)

1061
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:15,720
You don't have much time.

1062
00:39:15,723 --> 00:39:18,150
(Jong Kook and Seol Hyun answer only 1 question right.)

1063
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:21,360
The first mission was Cosmic Charm Bboom Bboom Every Day Heart Attack.

1064
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:22,630
Ji Hyo and Seung Yoon win.

1065
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,960
(They win the 2nd round where 20 points were at stake.)

1066
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,500
- We turned the table around. - That's true.

1067
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,330
- That's amazing. - They had 10 and 20 points.

1068
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:30,100
One of them is about the vaccinated human.

1069
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:31,630
And the other one is about the contagious zombie.

1070
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:35,040
(They get hints about the vaccinated human and the contagious zombies.)

1071
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:37,070
- Both of them... - I see.

1072
00:39:37,078 --> 00:39:38,980
(What are the hints they received?)

1073
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,855
(Contagious zombies are a pair of mixed genders.)

1074
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:44,855
But we will get to narrow them down a lot.

1075
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,350
The 2 of you can choose 1 couple.

1076
00:39:48,356 --> 00:39:50,920
You can switch with them.

1077
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:52,520
- Switch, so we know who they are. - Is that so?

1078
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,120
(Let's switch.)

1079
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:56,460
- To find out if they're zombies. - They might suspect each other.

1080
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:58,490
- We don't know about each other. - But this is...

1081
00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:00,875
- Switch with whom you suspect. - You must switch.

1082
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,570
We should put the zombies together. We must pair them up together.

1083
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,700
Zombies must be paired up for the humans to be safe.

1084
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:06,770
Why are you being aggressive?

1085
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:11,240
(Kwang Soo. Why are you being aggressive?)

1086
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,585
Me?

1087
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,540
- Was I being aggressive? - Are you not? What's going on?

1088
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:18,025
Well, if he asks you that, doesn't it mean it's true?

1089
00:40:18,252 --> 00:40:19,380
That's right. That's right.

1090
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:21,180
(My gosh... I can't get a word in, can I?)

1091
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,165
- The vaccinated human is a man. - Right.

1092
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,805
The vaccinated human is a man. Listen.

1093
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,920
There are two teams of zombies.

1094
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:30,835
It means each zombie is paired up.

1095
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:33,000
We have to split one of the teams.

1096
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
(We must split one of the zombie couples.)

1097
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:36,115
(Actually, these two are...)

1098
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,930
(This morning before the opening segment)

1099
00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:41,200
Kang Seung Yoon is a human.

1100
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:42,485
Okay.

1101
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,910
Song Ji Hyo is a human.

1102
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:46,255
Is that so?

1103
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,525
(Both of them are human.)

1104
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,580
We have to split one of the teams.

1105
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:54,895
The vaccinated human might be either Seok Jin or Se Chan.

1106
00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:58,690
(Since the vaccinated human is male, it could be one of them.)

1107
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,305
- Do you think so? - Wouldn't it be?

1108
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:01,390
(Let's switch with them.)

1109
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:02,705
Okay.

1110
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:06,130
- The number might change afterward. - That's right.

1111
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,800
- No. First of all... - It's hard even with the hints.

1112
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:11,015
- Okay. Have you decided? - We'll...

1113
00:41:12,506 --> 00:41:16,570
- switch with Seok Jin and Se Chan. - What?

1114
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:18,455
- Really? - Seriously?

1115
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,510
(Why are they switching with them?)

1116
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,080
- Why? - Seriously?

1117
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:24,950
Which one of you will pair up with Ji Hyo?

1118
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,520
I'll pair up with Seok Jin.

1119
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
(Ji Hyo will pair up with Seok Jin.)

1120
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,250
- Then Se Chan will... - I'll be with Seung Yoon?

1121
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:31,350
(Se Chan and Seung Yoon are a couple.)

1122
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:32,620
- I don't think it's right. - Yes.

1123
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:33,890
You two look alike.

1124
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:35,390
- No. - You thought I wasn't a zombie.

1125
00:41:35,396 --> 00:41:36,990
- No, no. It's not that. - Hold on a second.

1126
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,530
Does this switch bring any changes?

1127
00:41:38,532 --> 00:41:42,570
All right. As of now, there are...

1128
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:44,330
(If the number of zombies increases...)

1129
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:45,945
Were there originally four?

1130
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:47,540
I think there are four.

1131
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,000
(It means Seok Jin and Se Chan are zombies.)

1132
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,210
- There are four zombies. - I knew it.

1133
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:54,040
(There are still 4 zombies.)

1134
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,110
- It remains the same. - To be honest,

1135
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:58,450
even if Se Chan is a zombie, doesn't the number stay four?

1136
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:00,820
- All four of you may be human. - Right.

1137
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:03,920
- That's most likely. - That's most likely as of now.

1138
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:06,760
- Right. - It's most likely that we're human.

1139
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:09,205
Right, all four of them are human.

1140
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,930
(Candidates for contagious zombies)

1141
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:14,260
(They're exempted from being candidates.)

1142
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,930
(Ji Hyo, Seung Yoon, Seok Jin, and Se Chan)

1143
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:20,570
You'll divide into two teams and go eat.

1144
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:22,610
- Okay, let's get it. - Let's get it.

1145
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,940
(Will they identify the contagious zombies?)

1146
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,585
We'll probably eat.

1147
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,250
Why did Ji Hyo pick us?

1148
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,580
(They head to a seafood restaurant.)

1149
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,580
I'm suspicious of Jong Kook's couple.

1150
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:35,520
- My team? - Yes.

1151
00:42:35,523 --> 00:42:37,320
- I think they're zombies. - Is it either me or her?

1152
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:38,890
- Both of you. - Both of us?

1153
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:42,875
- You guys were also annoying. - Right.

1154
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:45,230
- What do you mean? - Jong Kook is too excited.

1155
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:47,360
In old movies...

1156
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:50,570
about contagious zombies and Dracula,

1157
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,900
it's always the beautiful woman.

1158
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:54,940
Men are bewitched by her.

1159
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:57,640
- It could be Seol Hyun. - Doesn't she seem like it?

1160
00:42:57,645 --> 00:42:59,980
- They don't give me that role. - Really?

1161
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,610
Most spies make that comment.

1162
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:04,610
"They don't give me that role," "I get caught."

1163
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:08,125
They don't ever give him such a role.

1164
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:11,150
They don't, but he always pretends to be it.

1165
00:43:11,158 --> 00:43:12,720
- I'm too obvious. - Right.

1166
00:43:12,726 --> 00:43:14,665
- He's always misunderstood. - People think it's me.

1167
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:18,960
I prefer to turn into a zombie if Seol Hyun is a contagious zombie.

1168
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:20,100
Zombie?

1169
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,045
(His heart flutters.)

1170
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,500
I get the impression that she's the vaccinated human.

1171
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:28,570
- Right. - I bet she'll cure others.

1172
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:30,885
(She looks like someone with vaccinations.)

1173
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:35,425
I've noticed for a long time that Seol Hyun never denies anything.

1174
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:37,750
She never denies any compliments.

1175
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:41,165
- She's honest. - She knows how to enjoy them.

1176
00:43:41,188 --> 00:43:42,480
She accepts compliments.

1177
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:44,290
She'll say no if we called her a zombie.

1178
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,965
By the way,

1179
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,290
you're pretending to be cute today.

1180
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:50,860
- Me? - Is it because of Min Ho?

1181
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:52,760
- You aren't usually like this. - She's not being extreme.

1182
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,875
So Min isn't usually like this.

1183
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:58,115
So Min definitely reacts when you tease her.

1184
00:43:58,706 --> 00:44:00,170
- I'm happy. - That's good.

1185
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:02,240
She's being feminine.

1186
00:44:02,243 --> 00:44:06,280
- Why are you looking outside? - She opens and closes the window.

1187
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,380
She opens and closes the curtain.

1188
00:44:08,382 --> 00:44:11,110
Have you ever been shy, Ji Hyo?

1189
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:12,680
- No. - I see.

1190
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:15,080
- No guest made your heart flutter? - No.

1191
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:16,590
- Did you want to impress any? - No.

1192
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,520
- Did you like anyone? - Not at all.

1193
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,990
(Not at all.)

1194
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,320
There have been 401 episodes so far.

1195
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:22,905
(They've had 401 episodes.)

1196
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:25,290
She's never had a guest whom she liked.

1197
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:27,260
(Ji Hyo never had a crush during the last 8 years.)

1198
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:31,215
(The bus keeps moving.)

1199
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:34,140
- Here we are. - It looks delicious.

1200
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,545
It looks delicious.

1201
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:38,010
What's the mission? Will someone not get to eat?

1202
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:40,780
- Of course. - We have to eat.

1203
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:42,240
This mission...

1204
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:45,350
is a group mission. You can win hints and food.

1205
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,980
- It's called Huge Drawing. - Drawing is good.

1206
00:44:47,988 --> 00:44:49,050
(Huge Drawing)

1207
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:51,720
Determine the order of your seating.

1208
00:44:51,725 --> 00:44:53,390
(Sit in a single file.)

1209
00:44:53,394 --> 00:44:55,490
The first member reads the given word...

1210
00:44:55,496 --> 00:44:57,790
and draws it within five seconds.

1211
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:01,360
The next member copies the drawing in a relay.

1212
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:04,130
If the final member guesses the correct word, you win.

1213
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:06,740
- It sounds good. - It's a team play.

1214
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,010
A contagious zombie will try to disturb the group.

1215
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,485
If you answer 1 out of 3, you win a hint about the contagious zombies.

1216
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,450
The whole group will get to win.

1217
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,350
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

1218
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:20,050
It won't be difficult.

1219
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:21,795
- It's a group mission. - Five seconds is short.

1220
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:24,220
- What? - You seem suspicious.

1221
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:25,450
If you make a mistake, you'll be suspected.

1222
00:45:25,459 --> 00:45:27,790
If you get it wrong, you're a contagious zombie.

1223
00:45:27,795 --> 00:45:29,490
- Seriously. - We won't even need the hint.

1224
00:45:29,496 --> 00:45:32,900
In the case of failing, one couple will change partners.

1225
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,260
(One couple will change partners if they fail.)

1226
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:37,530
You'll get only half of a meal.

1227
00:45:37,538 --> 00:45:38,915
That won't work.

1228
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,140
I'm hungry.

1229
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:41,400
(Will they clear the group mission?)

1230
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:45,340
Here's the first question. Only you get to read it.

1231
00:45:45,346 --> 00:45:46,710
It's an occupation.

1232
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:48,810
(It's a news anchor.)

1233
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:50,910
Min Ho, this is a group mission.

1234
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:53,265
If you get it wrong, you're a contagious zombie.

1235
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,780
- Get ready. - Isn't it okay?

1236
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:56,450
(If you make a wrong drawing, you'll be suspected.)

1237
00:45:56,457 --> 00:45:57,995
- We have to win. - One.

1238
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:00,190
- 2, 3, - You have to make it, Min Ho.

1239
00:46:00,194 --> 00:46:03,275
- Draw well, or you're suspected. - 4, 5.

1240
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:08,405
(He draws a news anchor and the news.)

1241
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,170
- Is it easy this time? - 4, 5.

1242
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:13,845
- Okay. - Is it easy?

1243
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,410
- Go. - What is this?

1244
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,940
- What did you draw? - I did my best.

1245
00:46:18,946 --> 00:46:19,940
- What is this? - Two.

1246
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,340
- 5 seconds is short. - 3.

1247
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,510
- 1, 2. - What's this?

1248
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:27,465
3, 4, 5. Time's up.

1249
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,235
(It's different from the original.)

1250
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:31,865
Five. Time's up.

1251
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:33,890
Wait.

1252
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:36,260
- This is not right. - Get ready.

1253
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:38,360
- Jong Kook is suspicious. - Gosh.

1254
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,300
- He's suspicious. - Seriously.

1255
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,130
- Two. - This is what I think.

1256
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,800
- He should change seats. - 3, 4.

1257
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,445
- That's it. - Five.

1258
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,310
(This is how a news anchor changed.)

1259
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,455
- 4, 5. - That's it.

1260
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:54,040
I'll do it.

1261
00:46:54,048 --> 00:46:55,685
(She shows her drawing.)

1262
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:58,480
- I can't believe it. - What's this?

1263
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:00,220
2, 3,

1264
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:03,320
- We have to draw in 5 seconds. - 4, 5.

1265
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:07,165
(What did he draw inside a rectangle?)

1266
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:09,020
Gosh, what's this?

1267
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,360
- One. - What is that?

1268
00:47:10,364 --> 00:47:12,860
(The last person to draw is Ji Hyo.)

1269
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:15,130
2, 3.

1270
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,800
(What kind of drawing is it?)

1271
00:47:16,804 --> 00:47:19,415
- She'll guess something strange. - Five.

1272
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:23,840
- No. - Take off the eye patch.

1273
00:47:23,844 --> 00:47:26,725
- He drew it like that. - I know that I did.

1274
00:47:26,947 --> 00:47:28,925
Min Ho drew it like that.

1275
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,580
(A news anchor is projected in a special way.)

1276
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:37,120
(Will So Min guess that it's a news anchor?)

1277
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,460
1, 2, 3.

1278
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,660
An architect?

1279
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,890
(Architect is wrong.)

1280
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:45,830
- What is this? Lift up the boards. - What is it?

1281
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,930
What is it?

1282
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:49,030
(What did Min Ho draw?)

1283
00:47:49,036 --> 00:47:50,800
What is it?

1284
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:52,245
- What do you think? - A news anchor?

1285
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:57,715
(So Min guesses it as soon as she sees it.)

1286
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:00,280
- How is that a news anchor? - I recognize it from the drawing.

1287
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,240
(I recognize the answer from his drawing.)

1288
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:03,910
This is where it went wrong.

1289
00:48:03,917 --> 00:48:05,810
- What? - I drew well.

1290
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,680
This is where it went wrong.

1291
00:48:07,688 --> 00:48:09,950
- What did you draw? - I made the same drawing.

1292
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,250
What's that?

1293
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:12,690
- What's that? - How would I've guessed?

1294
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:14,220
Look, this is offensive.

1295
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,390
Look at Seol Hyun's drawing.

1296
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,260
- Look at mine. - I drew the exact same thing.

1297
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,630
- This is obviously a news anchor. - Wait a minute.

1298
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,300
- Here's what I think. - This is...

1299
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:25,445
- Jong Kook is suspicious. - That's way off.

1300
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,340
(That's way off.)

1301
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:28,770
- Give it to me. - He's suspicious.

1302
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:30,140
- What's this? - Give it to me.

1303
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:31,940
- What's this drawing? - Give it back.

1304
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,510
Isn't Jong Kook strange?

1305
00:48:34,515 --> 00:48:36,410
It's strange that he drew that.

1306
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,750
- It's obviously a news anchor. - Really?

1307
00:48:38,752 --> 00:48:41,250
- This is all I saw. - Goodness.

1308
00:48:41,255 --> 00:48:43,890
- I'll change seats with Jong Kook. - I'll go first.

1309
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:45,750
- With Jong Kook? - I'll go first.

1310
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:48,165
- This is easy. I'll help us win. - He's suspicious.

1311
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,490
- He's being very strange. - Decide after this round.

1312
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:54,300
- He's obviously suspicious. - You smell like a zombie.

1313
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:57,670
Next category is sports.

1314
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,840
Look carefully. Here we go.

1315
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,200
Start.

1316
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:03,585
1, 2,

1317
00:49:03,644 --> 00:49:06,955
3, 4, 5.

1318
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:10,280
(Jong Kook draws without hesitation.)

1319
00:49:10,284 --> 00:49:12,480
(What did he draw?)

1320
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:14,725
Here you go.

1321
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:19,765
(The keyword is related to sports.)

1322
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:24,790
1, 2,

1323
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,645
- Do you know what it is? - 3, 4, 5. Stop.

1324
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,740
(He drew something similar.)

1325
00:49:34,741 --> 00:49:36,385
Five. Stop.

1326
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:39,840
- All right. 1, 2, - What is it?

1327
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:43,410
- 3, 4, 5. - It's a sport.

1328
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:46,465
(What kind of sport is it?)

1329
00:49:46,587 --> 00:49:49,325
- What is it? I see. - 1, 2.

1330
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:52,665
3, 4, 5. Stop.

1331
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,405
(The drawing changed a lot.)

1332
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:00,405
Five. Stop.

1333
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:03,715
- 1, 2, 3, - What is that?

1334
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:08,015
- 4, 5. - Draw well.

1335
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:10,755
(She laughs at her own drawing.)

1336
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:14,140
(What kind of sport is it?)

1337
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,885
I'm going to look.

1338
00:50:15,916 --> 00:50:18,810
What is that? Is it a squid?

1339
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:21,420
Don't you think it's a jumping board?

1340
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,790
- Goodness, is this a sport? - Yes.

1341
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,935
What kind of sport has a triangle?

1342
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:29,660
- A triangle? - What kind of sport is it?

1343
00:50:29,663 --> 00:50:31,075
What's the answer?

1344
00:50:31,265 --> 00:50:34,100
(It has a drawing of a person...)

1345
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:36,945
(and a triangular sign.)

1346
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:39,100
- One. - Is it a sport?

1347
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,200
(What was the given word?)

1348
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:42,645
- Yes. - UFC.

1349
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,570
(UFC is wrong.)

1350
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:46,140
Isn't a person tangled in something?

1351
00:50:46,146 --> 00:50:47,580
Can't you tell from my drawing?

1352
00:50:47,581 --> 00:50:49,040
- Is it billiards? - What do you think it is?

1353
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,525
- That? - What's that?

1354
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,280
(Look at it carefully.)

1355
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:53,995
- That? - Yes.

1356
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:55,380
- Curling? - It's curling.

1357
00:50:55,389 --> 00:50:57,595
(That's right.)

1358
00:50:57,958 --> 00:51:01,160
(The answer was curling.)

1359
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,435
It's curling.

1360
00:51:02,529 --> 00:51:04,490
- How is that curling? - It's the Olympics symbol.

1361
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:06,775
- These are the Olympics rings. - It's a Buddhist lamp ceremony.

1362
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:09,770
(Isn't it a lamp ceremony?)

1363
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,000
It's a Buddhist lamp ceremony.

1364
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:13,715
(He only sees a lamp.)

1365
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,740
I thought it was billiards from Seol Hyun's drawing.

1366
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,510
- I thought it was billiards. - This was the last drawing.

1367
00:51:18,512 --> 00:51:20,440
How did it change that way?

1368
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,280
That's why I drew billiard balls.

1369
00:51:23,283 --> 00:51:25,750
(From curling to billiards)

1370
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:28,450
I wondered if I should draw this or not.

1371
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,150
- I wondered... - Jong Kook is suspicious.

1372
00:51:30,157 --> 00:51:32,090
(Jong Kook is suspicious.)

1373
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,990
I know your drawing skills, Jong Kook.

1374
00:51:33,994 --> 00:51:36,860
- We know your drawing skills. - How could he draw like that?

1375
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:38,330
I did my best.

1376
00:51:38,332 --> 00:51:39,700
- No way. - Seriously.

1377
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,730
- You should've focused on the hand. - Exactly.

1378
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:45,275
(They get two questions wrong in a row.)

1379
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,270
I have to eat it.

1380
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:50,410
I might not be able to let you win, but I'll let you eat.

1381
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:52,110
- Please. - All right.

1382
00:51:52,112 --> 00:51:55,140
- Everyone is sensitive right now. - Whoever the zombies are,

1383
00:51:55,148 --> 00:51:57,380
- don't fail on purpose here. - No.

1384
00:51:57,384 --> 00:51:58,980
We have to eat.

1385
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:01,850
To win hints and lunch,

1386
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:04,090
you'll play four kinds of games.

1387
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:05,550
(4 Random Games)

1388
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:07,060
- What's that? - What's that?

1389
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,905
(4 Random Games?)

1390
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,660
Each couple will play 1 of the 4 games.

1391
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:16,570
To accomplish the mission, every team has to succeed.

1392
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:18,375
(They have to succeed within 3 tries.)

1393
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:20,115
That sounds hard.

1394
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,370
If you fail on purpose, it'll show.

1395
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:25,570
I know some of you are zombies,

1396
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,580
- but let's eat first. - Seriously.

1397
00:52:28,582 --> 00:52:29,850
- Okay. - Okay.

1398
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,155
- Let's go. - Let's start from Haha.

1399
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,665
- Let's get it. - Haha will start.

1400
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:36,550
Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1401
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:38,820
(They have to say a different syllable than the producer.)

1402
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,990
Seafood. "Sea" or "food".

1403
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,020
- Food. - Food.

1404
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:44,360
(Seafood)

1405
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:45,490
(Food)

1406
00:52:45,499 --> 00:52:46,500
Gosh.

1407
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,560
(The first try fails.)

1408
00:52:47,567 --> 00:52:50,500
That's it? It's over?

1409
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,770
I shouldn't have gotten in the same car as him.

1410
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:54,670
Gosh. I want to eat.

1411
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:58,270
- Let's start from Se Chan. - What are you doing?

1412
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:00,740
You obviously should've said, "sea".

1413
00:53:00,747 --> 00:53:03,310
(Isn't it obvious?)

1414
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:06,380
- I wasn't even considering "food". - It's definitely "sea".

1415
00:53:06,386 --> 00:53:09,425
- And it's "pus", not "octo". - Hey, zombie.

1416
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:10,690
This is unfair.

1417
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,720
- Let's start from Se Chan. - What are you doing?

1418
00:53:12,726 --> 00:53:15,235
- This is unfair. - Let's start from Se Chan.

1419
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,360
Say it backwards. "South Africa".

1420
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,405
Caraf...

1421
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:22,575
(Fail)

1422
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:27,000
Let's just give up. We have two zombies here.

1423
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:29,270
- Let's just give up. - We have two zombies.

1424
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,470
There's no way we can eat.

1425
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,310
- Can you say it backwards? - Of course.

1426
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:34,625
- "Acirfa Htuos". - Hold on.

1427
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:37,780
Those at the ends are just too bad.

1428
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:39,480
- Can we... - What?

1429
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:42,180
We're bad? Do you want to switch?

1430
00:53:42,189 --> 00:53:44,250
- Jae Seok, do you want to switch? - Guys.

1431
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:46,460
- Be confident. - Let's do it in a random order.

1432
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,335
My goodness.

1433
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,635
Please start from Jae Seok.

1434
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,960
All right. Watch us.

1435
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:54,760
- What if I make a mistake? - Let's start.

1436
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:56,045
Okay.

1437
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,470
- Song Ji Hyo Game. - Game.

1438
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:02,000
(They have to form a 3-syllable word.)

1439
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:03,785
- Bir. - Th.

1440
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:07,110
(Rate)

1441
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:08,140
Desire.

1442
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:10,580
- He said, "rate". - I meant "rate".

1443
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,680
- You said, "birth desire". - No.

1444
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:15,495
- You have a birth desire? - A birth desire?

1445
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:19,535
- You have a desire to give birth? - "Birth desire"?

1446
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:22,460
- I... - It's a desire to give birth?

1447
00:54:22,462 --> 00:54:25,090
I messed up. Let me confess.

1448
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:27,260
She said, "rate", and I heard it wrong.

1449
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,230
- I'm sorry. She said... - You failed.

1450
00:54:30,237 --> 00:54:31,230
It doesn't make sense.

1451
00:54:31,238 --> 00:54:33,585
(They fail to win hints.)

1452
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:38,740
Get ready. This time, it's an occupation.

1453
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:41,110
- I'm in trouble. It'll be hard. - Ready.

1454
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:43,755
- Start. - Simplify it as much as you can.

1455
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,695
- Simplify it. - 1, 2,

1456
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:50,820
3, 4, 5. Stop.

1457
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,220
That was hard. We're in trouble.

1458
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:54,135
(Teacher, blackboard, students)

1459
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:56,805
1, 2,

1460
00:54:57,063 --> 00:55:00,245
3, 4, 5.

1461
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:04,575
(Teacher, blackboard, curvy line?)

1462
00:55:04,804 --> 00:55:09,185
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3,

1463
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:12,510
- 4, 5. - No one is complaining.

1464
00:55:12,512 --> 00:55:15,255
(What's that curvy line?)

1465
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:18,850
(Okay)

1466
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:22,595
1, 2, 3,

1467
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:25,350
4, 5. Stop.

1468
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:27,235
(A square, a person, and a curvy line?)

1469
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,335
One...

1470
00:55:31,831 --> 00:55:34,630
- Okay. - You got it, right?

1471
00:55:34,634 --> 00:55:36,130
(It's less and less like a teacher.)

1472
00:55:36,136 --> 00:55:39,500
- 3, 4, - Why do you think I'll fail?

1473
00:55:39,506 --> 00:55:41,145
Five. Stop.

1474
00:55:41,541 --> 00:55:43,670
- Are you done? - This one...

1475
00:55:43,677 --> 00:55:45,240
- Seriously... - He has to get it right.

1476
00:55:45,245 --> 00:55:47,925
- If he gets it wrong... - I'll get it perfectly right.

1477
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:49,210
It's a kind of sports, right?

1478
00:55:49,215 --> 00:55:51,025
(What do you take me for?)

1479
00:55:51,184 --> 00:55:53,080
- No. It's an occupation. - What?

1480
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:55,995
- What is this? - It's an occupation?

1481
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,720
- That sounds forced. - He's pretending.

1482
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:03,405
- I can't help but suspect him. - It's an occupation?

1483
00:56:03,763 --> 00:56:05,830
- You have to give an answer. - I'm wrong?

1484
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:08,260
- One... - Hold on. Sir.

1485
00:56:08,268 --> 00:56:09,360
- Okay. - Sir.

1486
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,730
Look at this drawing.

1487
00:56:11,738 --> 00:56:13,570
(So Min is the only person who knows the answer.)

1488
00:56:13,573 --> 00:56:14,570
Hold on.

1489
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:15,870
(Say it.)

1490
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:18,770
- What did you just say? - Think of an occupation.

1491
00:56:18,778 --> 00:56:20,755
- What's the answer? - Hold on.

1492
00:56:21,114 --> 00:56:22,310
The drawing...

1493
00:56:22,315 --> 00:56:24,150
- Jong Kook. - Hold on.

1494
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,410
Sir. Hold on.

1495
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:29,380
- Jong Kook. - Give me a second.

1496
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,290
- It's an occupation? - Yes.

1497
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:33,620
- It's "teacher". - It's an occupation?

1498
00:56:33,627 --> 00:56:35,360
- 1, 2, 3. - "Teacher".

1499
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:36,665
Teacher.

1500
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:38,460
- Okay. - It was right.

1501
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:40,830
(Jong Kook answers, "teacher" in the end.)

1502
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:43,200
- I was right. It's a blackboard. - It's a blackboard.

1503
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:45,370
I was so sure it was "rhythmic gymnastics".

1504
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:46,640
How can this be...

1505
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,840
(It looks like rhythmic gymnastics.)

1506
00:56:48,842 --> 00:56:50,870
- Min Ho, you're suspicious. - Min Ho...

1507
00:56:50,877 --> 00:56:53,170
- Hold on. - I just copied the drawing...

1508
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,825
as best as I could.

1509
00:56:54,981 --> 00:56:58,010
(It all went downhill from Min Ho.)

1510
00:56:58,018 --> 00:57:01,480
- Min Ho is usually good at drawing. - Doesn't it look the same?

1511
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:04,550
This time, he had enough time...

1512
00:57:04,557 --> 00:57:07,490
to analyze the drawing.

1513
00:57:07,494 --> 00:57:09,460
- Something's fishy. - Min Ho is suspicious.

1514
00:57:09,462 --> 00:57:11,090
I just copied Min Ho's drawing.

1515
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,730
(The curvy line haunted Seol Hyun too.)

1516
00:57:12,732 --> 00:57:15,260
Isn't this a gymnastic ribbon?

1517
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:17,400
- She didn't do anything wrong. - Look.

1518
00:57:17,404 --> 00:57:20,300
(I'll protect you, Seol Hyun.)

1519
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:21,885
She's innocent.

1520
00:57:22,108 --> 00:57:24,670
- I did my best... - Seol Hyun, am I wrong?

1521
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:27,040
- You're right. - Right?

1522
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:28,880
- I did my best. - Seol Hyun trusts me.

1523
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:31,880
- You were taking time on purpose. - Seriously.

1524
00:57:31,885 --> 00:57:34,380
- Seol Hyun trusts me. - Jong Kook looks stiff.

1525
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:37,320
I said, "teacher" in the end.

1526
00:57:37,323 --> 00:57:39,750
Wasn't that to avoid suspicion?

1527
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:42,090
- No. Look. - I'm right, right?

1528
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:44,375
(Is one of them a contagious zombie?)

1529
00:57:44,731 --> 00:57:45,760
(What is the other team doing?)

1530
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:48,100
Let's forget about zombies for now.

1531
00:57:48,101 --> 00:57:50,930
- Please let two teams eat. - Let half of us eat.

1532
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:53,230
- Okay. - We failed anyway.

1533
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:56,045
We should let two teams eat even if we all fail.

1534
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:58,715
Let's start. You have to succeed three times in a row.

1535
00:57:58,945 --> 00:58:00,555
- Who wants to start? - Hye Jeong.

1536
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,285
It's too hard.

1537
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:05,095
Song Ji Hyo Game. Go.

1538
00:58:05,852 --> 00:58:07,495
- To. - Guy.

1539
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:09,995
- Dried. - Shredded.

1540
00:58:10,023 --> 00:58:11,550
- Squid. - Wedding.

1541
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:12,990
- How many times are we doing this? - It's over.

1542
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:14,020
Fail.

1543
00:58:14,027 --> 00:58:17,805
(The producer says the next word.)

1544
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:20,660
(Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong fail.)

1545
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:23,160
We told you it's three times.

1546
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:25,000
- After two... - Fail.

1547
00:58:25,004 --> 00:58:28,015
- You should have focused. - You'll starve.

1548
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:29,870
- You'll starve. - Why did you do that?

1549
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:31,670
- I'm sorry. - Are you...

1550
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,170
- Are you a zombie? - You'll all starve.

1551
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,525
- Okay, okay. - I thought it was only two tries.

1552
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:38,925
- She thought they were done. - I thought there were only two.

1553
00:58:39,986 --> 00:58:43,050
"Winner". "Win" or "ner". 1, 2, 3.

1554
00:58:43,056 --> 00:58:44,335
- Ner. - Ner.

1555
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,135
- Kazakhstan. - Tan...

1556
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:51,135
- Indonesia. - Asineido.

1557
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:54,875
Sit down. Get out, you all!

1558
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:57,370
- Get out, you zombies. - It's a mess.

1559
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,770
Let us just draw lots.

1560
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:01,840
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1561
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:03,170
Let's just play rock-paper-scissors.

1562
00:59:03,176 --> 00:59:05,070
Tell me how we can let you eat.

1563
00:59:05,078 --> 00:59:08,010
- We'll try Giant Chestnut Bread. - We'll try Giant Chestnut Bread.

1564
00:59:08,014 --> 00:59:10,410
- The winners can eat. - Yes. Giant Chestnut Bread.

1565
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:13,725
It's set then. Two winning teams will eat.

1566
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:15,295
Da Young, try it.

1567
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:17,635
- I'll let you eat. - Focus.

1568
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,735
Giant Chestnut Bread Game. Say, "shark's fin" five times.

1569
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:25,475
Shark's fin, shark's fin, shark's fin, shark's fin, shark's fin.

1570
00:59:25,565 --> 00:59:27,445
(Success)

1571
00:59:27,967 --> 00:59:29,460
Say, "thistle" five times.

1572
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:33,130
- Thistle, thistle, thistle... - Okay!

1573
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,570
- Okay. - Say, "refund" five times.

1574
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:38,210
Refund, refund, refund...

1575
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:41,280
(She slurs the word.)

1576
00:59:41,281 --> 00:59:44,010
(Fail)

1577
00:59:44,017 --> 00:59:47,280
Can I try it personally...

1578
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:49,680
regardless of my team?

1579
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:51,350
Let's just stop.

1580
00:59:51,357 --> 00:59:55,990
Refund, refund, refund...

1581
00:59:55,995 --> 00:59:57,405
Refund...

1582
00:59:57,463 --> 01:00:00,035
(Spitting)

1583
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:03,075
- He's a zombie. I caught him. - He's a zombie.

1584
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,070
- I'm not a zombie. - You punk...

1585
01:00:06,072 --> 01:00:07,740
- Eat charcoal. - Why?

1586
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,370
- Zombies don't eat charcoal. - I'm not a zombie.

1587
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:11,870
- One team has been eliminated. - Okay.

1588
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:13,580
(Jae Seok and Joo E are left.)

1589
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,580
Giant Chestnut Bread Game. Say this word five times.

1590
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:18,210
"Sticky rice in red bean porridge".

1591
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:20,780
(Sticky rice in red bean porridge)

1592
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:23,790
- Start. - Sticky rice...

1593
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,835
(Slurring)

1594
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:29,435
Sticky rice...

1595
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:31,860
(Fail)

1596
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:34,230
That was hilarious.

1597
01:00:34,234 --> 01:00:36,460
- "Sticky rice..." - "Sticky rice..."

1598
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,570
Sticky rice in red bean porridge... Gosh.

1599
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:42,315
These two teams can eat.

1600
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:43,770
We can eat.

1601
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:46,840
But you won't get any hints. Also, since you've failed,

1602
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:50,480
your partners will be changed. You can eat before that.

1603
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:53,750
- Zombies don't get to eat. - Zombies...

1604
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:54,750
(Let's eat first.)

1605
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:56,525
That looks so tasty.

1606
01:00:57,223 --> 01:01:00,020
- The mushrooms smell so good. - It has neungi mushrooms in it.

1607
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:01,735
(Boiled chicken with neungi mushrooms)

1608
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:05,405
The broth tastes so good.

1609
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:08,345
It's boiling. Let me give you some.

1610
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,200
That looks so good.

1611
01:01:10,203 --> 01:01:11,515
(That looks so tasty.)

1612
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:13,470
(Thirsty)

1613
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:15,215
I want some rice and soup.

1614
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:19,855
It looks delicious.

1615
01:01:19,879 --> 01:01:21,280
I'm glad I chose this one.

1616
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:23,780
(Live abalone and octopus)

1617
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,855
- It's abalone. - I want some too.

1618
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:27,280
It's delicious.

1619
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:28,420
(It's so chewy.)

1620
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:31,465
- I prefer octopus to chicken. - So do I.

1621
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:34,220
Here is a hint about the contagious zombies.

1622
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:35,990
- It has to be shared. - What if Jong Kook isn't a zombie?

1623
01:01:35,995 --> 01:01:38,860
I'm not. You know that.

1624
01:01:38,865 --> 01:01:40,330
A hint about the zombies? Let me see.

1625
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,745
I'll pass it around.

1626
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:43,375
"The contagious zombies..."

1627
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:46,145
"are over 165cm tall."

1628
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:49,000
That excludes Joo E and Da Young.

1629
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:50,385
(The contagious zombies are over 165cm tall.)

1630
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:54,325
(Joo E and Da Young are excluded.)

1631
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:57,310
We have to switch the couples now.

1632
01:01:57,317 --> 01:01:59,295
Decide how you'll switch them.

1633
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:00,880
I'm a little bit suspicious of Kwang Soo.

1634
01:02:00,887 --> 01:02:02,620
If you're innocent, you should be able to switch.

1635
01:02:02,622 --> 01:02:04,750
He could have done it earlier, but he didn't.

1636
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,550
- We have to check him. - How?

1637
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,935
We just need to check you.

1638
01:02:09,362 --> 01:02:10,975
If you're suspicious of me, you can switch.

1639
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,130
- Let's switch him. - Okay.

1640
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:14,460
- What do you think, Seung Yoon? - I think we should try it.

1641
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:15,960
- That's how we'll know. - We can split.

1642
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:18,200
- We have the hint too. - You have to find out.

1643
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:20,070
Then Seung Yoon will be...

1644
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,370
- With Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo's partner.

1645
01:02:21,374 --> 01:02:22,470
(Se Chan and Seung Yoon switch with Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong.)

1646
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:24,140
Hye Jeong will partner up with Se Chan.

1647
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:26,410
- Yes. - Se Chan.

1648
01:02:26,412 --> 01:02:28,580
I'll tell you how many zombies there are.

1649
01:02:28,581 --> 01:02:30,155
- You switched, right? - Yes.

1650
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:32,595
As of now, there are...

1651
01:02:33,252 --> 01:02:38,490
(Humans Se Chan and Seung Yoon switched with a suspicious couple.)

1652
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,165
(How did the number of zombies change?)

1653
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:43,605
As of now, there are...

1654
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:49,500
(Humans Se Chan and Seung Yoon switched with a suspicious couple.)

1655
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:52,175
(How did the number of zombies change?)

1656
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:54,615
There are...

1657
01:02:55,808 --> 01:02:56,970
- six zombies. - What?

1658
01:02:56,976 --> 01:02:58,270
(There are 6 zombies.)

1659
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,670
Wait. What?

1660
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,285
- Who switched? - It increased, right?

1661
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:04,680
There's one more zombie.

1662
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:05,750
(Kwang Soo and Hye Jeong had to be a zombie couple.)

1663
01:03:05,752 --> 01:03:07,950
- It's everybody but us. - This team...

1664
01:03:07,954 --> 01:03:10,590
You switched, and you got infected, right?

1665
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:14,360
What is certain is that us four are zombies.

1666
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,135
We're zombies.

1667
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:18,260
(Hold on.)

1668
01:03:18,264 --> 01:03:19,575
I didn't know.

1669
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,875
(He turns serious.)

1670
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:24,300
You're a crook.

1671
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:26,075
(I didn't think of you that way.)

1672
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,000
(Kwang Soo is a zombie now.)

1673
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,740
(What is he saying?)

1674
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:33,170
What do you mean?

1675
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:36,010
Kwang Soo, it looks like you were tricked.

1676
01:03:36,015 --> 01:03:37,555
Can I have a bottle of soju, please?

1677
01:03:38,618 --> 01:03:39,810
(One of them has to be a contagious zombie.)

1678
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:41,350
I didn't do anything.

1679
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:42,420
(One of them has to be a contagious zombie.)

1680
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:45,220
(Which one of them is it?)

1681
01:03:45,224 --> 01:03:49,105
(Strongest candidates for the contagious zombies)

1682
01:03:49,495 --> 01:03:51,930
(They arrive at a water park where the last race will be held.)

1683
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:54,560
- What do I do? - It's okay.

1684
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:57,500
(There are many scary rides here. What kind of race will it be?)

1685
01:03:57,503 --> 01:04:00,640
The last round of Zombie Couple Race...

1686
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,840
is Zombie Run.

1687
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:03,400
(The last round is Zombie Run.)

1688
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,615
- Zombie Run. - Zombie Run?

1689
01:04:05,745 --> 01:04:08,780
You have 30 minutes to go on the water rides...

1690
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:11,610
and earn hints about the contagious zombies or the vaccinated human.

1691
01:04:11,617 --> 01:04:12,780
We have to go on them?

1692
01:04:12,785 --> 01:04:16,220
The more extreme the ride is, the better the hints are.

1693
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:18,735
(There are different levels of hints according to the rides.)

1694
01:04:18,791 --> 01:04:24,975
(They must go on the extreme rides to get both hints at the same time.)

1695
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:30,005
(If they go for speedy rides, they only get one hint.)

1696
01:04:31,304 --> 01:04:33,130
We have to go on the rides.

1697
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,440
(We have to ride them to earn the hints.)

1698
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,840
I can't do this. I can't go on the scary ones.

1699
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:40,985
If you're a zombie, once you're instructed by a contagious zombie,

1700
01:04:41,013 --> 01:04:42,710
a mark will appear on your body.

1701
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:45,280
Until you become a human again, you must walk and act...

1702
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:46,855
like a zombie and obey their orders.

1703
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:49,250
- You have to act like a zombie? - What?

1704
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:50,750
- What is this? - Once you are told to do so.

1705
01:04:50,756 --> 01:04:52,050
We have to act like zombies?

1706
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,550
(You have to be their avatar and act like a zombie?)

1707
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:56,005
- You have to act? - Yes.

1708
01:04:56,162 --> 01:04:59,030
You have to do this all of a sudden?

1709
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:00,260
Like "Train to Busan".

1710
01:05:00,266 --> 01:05:04,045
(They need to mimic "Train to Busan".)

1711
01:05:04,337 --> 01:05:06,500
Contagious zombies or vaccinated human should be eliminated.

1712
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:09,070
If they're not out in 30 minutes, there will be a trial.

1713
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:10,200
There will be a trial?

1714
01:05:10,209 --> 01:05:12,110
There are so many zombies on our side.

1715
01:05:12,111 --> 01:05:13,615
Seung Yoon, I,

1716
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,710
- Hye Jeong, and Se Chan... - Hye Jeong, and Se Chan.

1717
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:17,280
- are zombies. - We're zombies.

1718
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:18,550
- How do you know? - We confessed.

1719
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:20,925
- There is a contagious zombie here. - There's a big possibility.

1720
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:23,520
- There's a contagious zombie there. - There is.

1721
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:26,535
Can I share the hint I got earlier?

1722
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:28,090
- You can. - Is it up to me?

1723
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,790
- You can share it with the zombies. - It doesn't matter.

1724
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:32,735
There are two contagious zombies, right?

1725
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:34,975
It's a male and a female.

1726
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:36,805
It's a male and a female.

1727
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:38,330
- 1 each. - 1 male and 1 female?

1728
01:05:38,337 --> 01:05:40,600
- There's one each. - 1 male and 1 female.

1729
01:05:40,606 --> 01:05:44,140
You'll move to your designated spots.

1730
01:05:44,143 --> 01:05:45,610
- Where are we going? - Designated spots?

1731
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:48,825
(The couples split and move to their designated spots.)

1732
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:50,325
What is this?

1733
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:53,755
(There are weird pictures.)

1734
01:05:54,187 --> 01:05:57,025
(Is there a hidden rule?)

1735
01:05:57,557 --> 01:05:58,690
What is this?

1736
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:02,435
(Is has full-body characters of everybody.)

1737
01:06:03,996 --> 01:06:07,600
(Full-body characters for a zombie race?)

1738
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,230
Min Ho looks like a zombie here.

1739
01:06:09,235 --> 01:06:11,745
(Min Ho looks like a zombie here.)

1740
01:06:13,206 --> 01:06:16,440
(Do you think I'm a contagious zombie?)

1741
01:06:16,442 --> 01:06:20,010
(There's something hidden here. What is this board about?)

1742
01:06:20,012 --> 01:06:21,510
One. Race starts.

1743
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:22,610
(Zombie Run starts.)

1744
01:06:22,615 --> 01:06:25,410
- We have to go on the extreme ones. - Let's do it.

1745
01:06:25,418 --> 01:06:27,280
- We should. - Of course.

1746
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:29,220
- What is this? - It's a blob jump.

1747
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,150
When you jump on it, you get launched.

1748
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:32,420
- Do you fall into the water? - Yes.

1749
01:06:32,425 --> 01:06:33,765
(They decide to try it without hesitating.)

1750
01:06:33,826 --> 01:06:35,190
1, 2, 3.

1751
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:37,535
Be careful. Good job.

1752
01:06:37,663 --> 01:06:41,460
(Seol Hyun jumps without hesitating.)

1753
01:06:41,467 --> 01:06:43,900
- Keep crawling. - She's good.

1754
01:06:43,903 --> 01:06:46,570
- You have to sit facing the front. - Face the front.

1755
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:49,245
- Be careful, Seol Hyun. - Okay.

1756
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:51,085
- Do I go? - Two,

1757
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:53,515
one. Jump.

1758
01:06:54,747 --> 01:06:59,955
(Rocket Seol Hyun is ready to launch for high-level hints.)

1759
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:04,365
(Flying)

1760
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:09,365
(Seol Hyun is launched.)

1761
01:07:10,263 --> 01:07:12,090
(Jong Kook and the lifeguard's weight makes Seol Hyun fly.)

1762
01:07:12,098 --> 01:07:13,260
She flew so high.

1763
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:15,975
(Jong Kook and the lifeguard's weight makes Seol Hyun fly.)

1764
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:22,100
(Do you really go that high?)

1765
01:07:22,108 --> 01:07:23,515
Are you all right?

1766
01:07:24,143 --> 01:07:26,085
(This is totally my style.)

1767
01:07:26,846 --> 01:07:28,925
How was it, Seol Hyun?

1768
01:07:29,081 --> 01:07:30,310
It was fine.

1769
01:07:30,316 --> 01:07:32,180
(They get hints about the contagious zombies and vaccinated human.)

1770
01:07:32,184 --> 01:07:33,525
All right.

1771
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:36,180
Contagious Zombie B is...

1772
01:07:36,188 --> 01:07:37,950
Okay. It's B?

1773
01:07:37,957 --> 01:07:39,020
Contagious Zombie B is a female.

1774
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:41,260
(Contagious Zombie B is a female.)

1775
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:45,630
(That makes Contagious Zombie A male.)

1776
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:49,160
The vaccinated human has no brothers.

1777
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:53,175
(Jae Seok, Haha, Min Ho)

1778
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:54,970
(Kwang Soo and Seung Yoon are by the water slide.)

1779
01:07:54,974 --> 01:07:56,345
I'll do it for you.

1780
01:07:56,942 --> 01:07:59,270
- Do we go up separately? - Yes.

1781
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:00,785
Can't we hold hands?

1782
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:03,625
I thought we were sliding down while holding hands.

1783
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:07,565
- We can't hold hands. - Of course.

1784
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:09,880
(Sighing)

1785
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:13,335
Can you let us hold hands? Can't we do that?

1786
01:08:13,926 --> 01:08:15,535
(Sighing)

1787
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:17,165
You'll get started at the same time.

1788
01:08:18,164 --> 01:08:21,705
- Okay. - Let go. I'll hold onto you.

1789
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:23,645
Slowly.

1790
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:29,370
(Are you ready for a high drop?)

1791
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,815
We have to do this.

1792
01:08:31,177 --> 01:08:33,770
(He makes a face.)

1793
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,040
We're ready.

1794
01:08:35,047 --> 01:08:36,625
- Three. - Cross your legs.

1795
01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:38,655
(Go!)

1796
01:08:46,425 --> 01:08:48,720
(They drop straight down...)

1797
01:08:48,728 --> 01:08:51,060
(and jump at the end.)

1798
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:54,405
(He's done this many times before and pinches his nose.)

1799
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:00,840
(Why did I...)

1800
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,170
(open my eyes?)

1801
01:09:05,177 --> 01:09:06,485
(Screaming)

1802
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:11,255
(He's shocked by the unexpected jump.)

1803
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:14,550
(What am I doing for hints?)

1804
01:09:14,553 --> 01:09:16,025
1, 2, 3.

1805
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:20,220
(Kwang Soo and Seung Yoon earn both hints.)

1806
01:09:20,226 --> 01:09:21,705
They just threw us in the water.

1807
01:09:21,927 --> 01:09:23,665
- It was so sudden. - Kwang Soo.

1808
01:09:23,763 --> 01:09:25,505
Contagious Zombie B was...

1809
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:28,205
born in a year that's an odd number.

1810
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:30,830
(So Min was born in 1986.)

1811
01:09:30,836 --> 01:09:33,070
(Hye Jeong was born in 1993. Seol Hyun was born in 1995.)

1812
01:09:33,072 --> 01:09:34,585
It's an even number, right?

1813
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:39,115
Here's the hint about the vaccinated human.

1814
01:09:39,445 --> 01:09:42,285
The vaccinated human has a younger sister.

1815
01:09:43,282 --> 01:09:48,265
(Jae Seok and Min Ho are the only candidates.)

1816
01:09:48,821 --> 01:09:50,720
- This is so... - Can we...

1817
01:09:50,723 --> 01:09:52,690
- not switch teams? - No, you can't.

1818
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:54,820
What are you talking about? What is the problem?

1819
01:09:54,827 --> 01:09:56,390
- I want more hints. - What's wrong?

1820
01:09:56,395 --> 01:09:57,890
Let's go. I'll do it.

1821
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,775
- Really? - Yes, let's go. What do you want?

1822
01:09:59,799 --> 01:10:01,275
- Next. - I'll do it.

1823
01:10:02,334 --> 01:10:04,470
(Haha and Da Young, Jae Seok and Joo E, )

1824
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,245
(and Seok Jin and Ji Hyo are on the Flying Fish.)

1825
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,870
(This is a low-level ride, so it should be okay, right?)

1826
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:14,980
- Hold on tightly when turning. - We need a high-level hint.

1827
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,510
No, stop.

1828
01:10:16,515 --> 01:10:18,625
(Start)

1829
01:10:21,954 --> 01:10:25,090
(The angry fish advances at a scary speed.)

1830
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:28,405
(Their faces get distorted like the angry fish.)

1831
01:10:29,662 --> 01:10:31,860
(Quick...)

1832
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:35,005
(turn)

1833
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:42,085
(Screaming)

1834
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:43,970
(How is this a low-level ride?)

1835
01:10:43,976 --> 01:10:48,125
It hurts. I'm in pain.

1836
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:51,610
- Stop it! - No.

1837
01:10:51,617 --> 01:10:54,580
We're going to bump into something.

1838
01:10:54,587 --> 01:10:56,050
(They cruise at full-speed...)

1839
01:10:56,055 --> 01:10:59,235
(toward the dock and stop right in front of it.)

1840
01:10:59,992 --> 01:11:01,660
(Oh, dear.)

1841
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,190
(Goodness)

1842
01:11:04,196 --> 01:11:07,505
- The driver got soaked. - He got soaked.

1843
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:12,145
(The driver just took a shower.)

1844
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:15,115
This was scary.

1845
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:17,340
The breaking part was awesome.

1846
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:18,440
That was awesome.

1847
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:21,410
(Where's my sanity?)

1848
01:11:21,413 --> 01:11:23,040
How was this low-level?

1849
01:11:23,048 --> 01:11:25,680
(They get a hint about the contagious zombies.)

1850
01:11:25,684 --> 01:11:28,695
- You can write it down or remember. - We'll remember.

1851
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:31,295
Contagious Zombie A...

1852
01:11:32,024 --> 01:11:33,820
does not have brothers.

1853
01:11:33,826 --> 01:11:36,590
(Contagious Zombie A does not have brothers.)

1854
01:11:36,595 --> 01:11:40,275
(Kwang Soo, Min Ho, Jae Seok)

1855
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:42,460
(Contagious Zombie A Candidates: Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, Min Ho)

1856
01:11:42,468 --> 01:11:44,500
(Contagious Zombie B Candidates: Seol Hyun, Hye Jeong)

1857
01:11:44,503 --> 01:11:47,315
(Vaccinated Human Candidates: Jae Seok, Min Ho)

1858
01:11:47,406 --> 01:11:48,870
- Start. - Let's go.

1859
01:11:48,874 --> 01:11:51,970
(Hye Jeong and Se Chan must finish the obstacle course in 1 minute.)

1860
01:11:51,977 --> 01:11:53,710
I did it. Hurry.

1861
01:11:53,712 --> 01:11:56,980
- What do I do? - Hurry, Hye Jeong.

1862
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:59,295
Go. Pass by.

1863
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:03,925
Keep going, Hye Jeong.

1864
01:12:04,456 --> 01:12:05,920
(She performs slapstick comedy.)

1865
01:12:05,925 --> 01:12:07,535
Keep going.

1866
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,565
Go, Hye Jeong.

1867
01:12:09,662 --> 01:12:11,860
Hurry, Hye Jeong. Come.

1868
01:12:11,864 --> 01:12:15,275
(What's going on?)

1869
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:21,145
(She's an antagonist in a drama who goes down.)

1870
01:12:23,142 --> 01:12:25,470
It's cold. The water is so cold.

1871
01:12:25,477 --> 01:12:27,455
Go up.

1872
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,380
- I'll help you. - I can't climb up.

1873
01:12:29,381 --> 01:12:31,325
(Let's just refuse the hint and get away from here.)

1874
01:12:32,217 --> 01:12:33,810
(They make everybody laugh and fail.)

1875
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:35,795
We can't do this in one minute. Come here.

1876
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:37,395
I'll help you.

1877
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:42,590
- Give us a hint. - It's about the vaccinated human.

1878
01:12:42,595 --> 01:12:44,575
The vaccinated human is the eldest child.

1879
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:47,600
- Vaccinated human is the eldest? - Yes.

1880
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,400
We have two hints about Contagious Zombie A.

1881
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:51,670
- Overlapping ones. - We have to pick those out.

1882
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,770
- Jae Seok. - I think...

1883
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:55,070
(Here's Zombie Kwang Soo.)

1884
01:12:55,074 --> 01:12:57,840
It was like this.

1885
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,285
Kwang Soo.

1886
01:12:59,578 --> 01:13:00,770
You scared me.

1887
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:03,540
(Why did Zombie Kwang Soo remove Seok Jin's name tag?)

1888
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:04,995
You scared me!

1889
01:13:06,385 --> 01:13:07,880
You scared me.

1890
01:13:07,886 --> 01:13:10,050
(You scared me.)

1891
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:12,965
I guess you were instructed to do this.

1892
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:14,120
- Someone ordered you. - Really?

1893
01:13:14,126 --> 01:13:16,605
(Was he given an order to rip Seok Jin's name tag?)

1894
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,035
Kwang Soo and Seung Yoon,

1895
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:23,705
you have been infected.

1896
01:13:25,571 --> 01:13:27,230
(They must follow the commands of the contagious zombie.)

1897
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:29,070
- We're infected. - You have been commanded...

1898
01:13:29,074 --> 01:13:30,740
by the contagious zombie that infected you.

1899
01:13:30,743 --> 01:13:32,470
(They must follow the commands of the contagious zombie.)

1900
01:13:32,478 --> 01:13:35,880
Rip Seok Jin's name tag, and turn him into a zombie.

1901
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:39,595
(They are avatars and have to rip Seok Jin's name tag.)

1902
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,650
(I'm a zombie.)

1903
01:13:45,658 --> 01:13:52,335
(They're zombies, but they're a bit excessive.)

1904
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,630
(I did it, Mr. Contagious Zombie.)

1905
01:13:55,634 --> 01:13:57,175
You were ordered.

1906
01:13:57,336 --> 01:13:58,470
- You were ordered. - Really?

1907
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,975
- We had to infect you. - Seok Jin and Ji Hyo...

1908
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,145
- are zombies now. - Why?

1909
01:14:03,242 --> 01:14:05,085
- He wasn't a zombie. - Because I got my name tag ripped?

1910
01:14:05,811 --> 01:14:08,210
Oh, gosh. What's wrong with you?

1911
01:14:08,213 --> 01:14:11,310
- I had to do as instructed. - They have been infected too.

1912
01:14:11,316 --> 01:14:14,180
(Who is the contagious zombie then?)

1913
01:14:14,186 --> 01:14:20,850
(Either Hye Jeong or Kwang Soo was a contagious zombie.)

1914
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:26,890
(Who is the contagious zombie that infected Kwang Soo?)

1915
01:14:26,899 --> 01:14:33,215
(Contagious Zombie B is Hye Jeong.)

1916
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,170
Today, we'll have a Zombie Couple Race.

1917
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:44,140
You're contagious zombies who can infect humans.

1918
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:47,595
(She heard about her identity alongside Contagious Zombie A.)

1919
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:57,205
(In order to prevent others from getting hints, she had to act.)

1920
01:14:57,329 --> 01:14:59,860
(She threw her body around and fulfilled her job too.)

1921
01:14:59,865 --> 01:15:03,745
(She was also a great entertainer.)

1922
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:09,545
- What's this? - What's this? Hold on.

1923
01:15:10,142 --> 01:15:11,585
What's this?

1924
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:14,855
- What's this? Haha. - What's this?

1925
01:15:15,848 --> 01:15:20,155
(Infected zombies, rip Seok Jin's name tag.)

1926
01:15:20,652 --> 01:15:23,780
(She infected Kwang Soo, so she made him rip Seok Jin's name tag.)

1927
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:28,905
You scared me. I guess you got instructed to do this.

1928
01:15:29,361 --> 01:15:30,865
- You were ordered. - Really?

1929
01:15:31,964 --> 01:15:33,230
Hold on.

1930
01:15:33,232 --> 01:15:37,345
(I'll infect all human beings in this world.)

1931
01:15:39,004 --> 01:15:41,140
- Here are the current numbers. - Okay.

1932
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,070
There are eight zombies so far.

1933
01:15:43,075 --> 01:15:45,455
- What? - What? No way!

1934
01:15:45,944 --> 01:15:48,310
- How many of us are there? - Where is the vaccine?

1935
01:15:48,313 --> 01:15:50,280
There are 14 of you. There are 8 zombies.

1936
01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:53,155
- 8? - There are 8 zombies?

1937
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:54,180
(If 4 more people get infected, contagious zombies win.)

1938
01:15:54,186 --> 01:15:55,665
Eight?

1939
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,750
Seok Jin and Ji Hyo got infected too.

1940
01:15:58,757 --> 01:15:59,990
- All of a sudden, right? - Yes.

1941
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:01,720
- Were they not zombies before? - They weren't.

1942
01:16:01,727 --> 01:16:03,360
- Were they not zombies? - No.

1943
01:16:03,362 --> 01:16:05,935
- How did this happen? - Look at this.

1944
01:16:06,698 --> 01:16:09,530
He's the eldest child and has no brothers.

1945
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:11,615
The male is...

1946
01:16:13,505 --> 01:16:18,110
(Contagious Zombie A has no brothers...)

1947
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:22,855
(and is the eldest child.)

1948
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:28,665
(It's either Jae Seok or Min Ho.)

1949
01:16:29,288 --> 01:16:35,460
(Is Jae Seok, who lingered around the board, Contagious Zombie A?)

1950
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,865
- What is this? - What's this?

1951
01:16:40,165 --> 01:16:45,230
(Or is it Min Ho, who also wandered around the board?)

1952
01:16:45,237 --> 01:16:46,915
It's not on the poster.

1953
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:52,555
(Who is Contagious Zombie A?)

1954
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,480
(I only did as instructed.)

1955
01:16:57,482 --> 01:16:59,880
- All right. - He's the male one.

1956
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:01,850
- I know. - Seok Jin and Ji Hyo...

1957
01:17:01,854 --> 01:17:04,025
- have been given orders. - To do what?

1958
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:08,360
(What did the contagious zombie command them to do?)

1959
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:10,560
- Rip Jong Kook's name tag. - What?

1960
01:17:10,562 --> 01:17:13,490
- What? - Rip Jong Kook's name tag.

1961
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:14,530
(Rip Jong Kook's name tag.)

1962
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:15,875
(Sniffing)

1963
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:19,770
(He listens right away.)

1964
01:17:19,771 --> 01:17:22,315
He was okay until a minute ago.

1965
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:24,185
He has to rip his name tag?

1966
01:17:24,443 --> 01:17:26,755
They have to rip my name tag? Those two?

1967
01:17:26,812 --> 01:17:28,110
- Really? - Yes.

1968
01:17:28,113 --> 01:17:29,385
Like that?

1969
01:17:29,615 --> 01:17:30,955
Like that?

1970
01:17:31,516 --> 01:17:35,025
How could you reveal the order when he was right there?

1971
01:17:35,587 --> 01:17:38,520
How could you do that to us?

1972
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:41,720
- I can't rip his name tag normally. - It's hard to rip it to begin with.

1973
01:17:41,727 --> 01:17:43,935
It's already so hard to rip it.

1974
01:17:44,363 --> 01:17:46,805
Can I do anything?

1975
01:17:46,932 --> 01:17:49,960
- Do I just keep running away? - Kim Jong Kook.

1976
01:17:49,968 --> 01:17:51,615
Can I throw him in the water?

1977
01:17:52,638 --> 01:17:54,115
Can I throw him in the water?

1978
01:17:54,439 --> 01:17:56,070
- Is that okay? - Kim Jong Kook.

1979
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:57,600
Can I throw him in the water?

1980
01:17:57,609 --> 01:17:59,315
- Kim Jong Kook. - Come.

1981
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:01,340
I can throw him in here, right?

1982
01:18:01,346 --> 01:18:02,510
- Kim Jong Kook. - Hold on.

1983
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:04,710
I don't want to go in the water.

1984
01:18:04,716 --> 01:18:06,810
I'm leaving.

1985
01:18:06,818 --> 01:18:09,880
- I won't rip his name tag. - Jong Kook.

1986
01:18:09,888 --> 01:18:12,890
- I have a microphone on me. - I don't want to go in the water.

1987
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:14,690
- Take his microphone off. - My microphone.

1988
01:18:14,693 --> 01:18:17,220
I'm going to throw him in the water. I'll soak him for a bit.

1989
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:18,830
My microphone.

1990
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:21,005
- Take it off. - Ji Hyo.

1991
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:22,975
My microphone.

1992
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:25,315
Watch the corners.

1993
01:18:25,437 --> 01:18:27,530
Watch the corners.

1994
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:30,915
My micro... Where? Where? Here?

1995
01:18:31,376 --> 01:18:33,485
(Splatting)

1996
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,755
(Zombie Seok Jin gets flung pitifully.)

1997
01:18:38,784 --> 01:18:39,910
(Mr. Contagious Zombie, he's too strong.)

1998
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:43,025
Zombie, what about the command?

1999
01:18:44,122 --> 01:18:47,050
- Zombie... - Three minutes before trial.

2000
01:18:47,059 --> 01:18:48,835
- Three minutes? - Yes.

2001
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:50,820
I don't know. This is confusing.

2002
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:53,035
(Seok Jin failed, so there are still 8 zombies.)

2003
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:55,700
You were infected,

2004
01:18:55,701 --> 01:18:57,860
but you have become human beings with the vaccinated human's help.

2005
01:18:57,869 --> 01:19:00,930
(You have become human beings with the vaccinated human's help.)

2006
01:19:00,939 --> 01:19:02,070
(When one zombie is treated, the couple becomes human.)

2007
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:04,015
- I... - Listen.

2008
01:19:04,176 --> 01:19:06,570
I will relieve your burden.

2009
01:19:06,578 --> 01:19:08,355
- We're serious. - The two of us...

2010
01:19:08,613 --> 01:19:10,210
just became human beings.

2011
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:11,725
- Really? - Yes.

2012
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,480
- We got the vaccine. - You're an inhumane person.

2013
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:16,720
I'm human.

2014
01:19:16,722 --> 01:19:17,880
- Were you a zombie? - We were.

2015
01:19:17,889 --> 01:19:19,590
We were both infected.

2016
01:19:19,591 --> 01:19:20,790
- Really? - You were infected?

2017
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:22,960
- Does that mean... - Really?

2018
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:25,560
Stop it. Stop doing that to Hye Jeong.

2019
01:19:25,564 --> 01:19:27,305
- Stop it. - Hye Jeong.

2020
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,760
(That contagious zombie used me.)

2021
01:19:30,769 --> 01:19:32,170
It was true.

2022
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:33,970
It's not me.

2023
01:19:33,972 --> 01:19:37,185
Race is over. Let's start the final trial.

2024
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:41,540
The contagious zombies didn't get eliminated in time,

2025
01:19:41,546 --> 01:19:43,210
so we're having a trial.

2026
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:44,785
I'm so mad.

2027
01:19:45,117 --> 01:19:48,280
You can discuss freely based on the hints you have.

2028
01:19:48,286 --> 01:19:51,025
Figure out who the contagious zombies are,

2029
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:55,320
and pick three couples to go on the platforms.

2030
01:19:55,327 --> 01:19:56,820
- Three couples? - Okay.

2031
01:19:56,828 --> 01:20:00,835
If the contagious zombies are included, Team Humans wins.

2032
01:20:00,866 --> 01:20:02,930
Even if the contagious zombies are included,

2033
01:20:02,934 --> 01:20:07,030
if a vaccinated human is also on the platform, the zombies win.

2034
01:20:07,039 --> 01:20:08,500
That's right.

2035
01:20:08,507 --> 01:20:10,440
(If they pick the vaccinated human too, the contagious zombies win.)

2036
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:14,040
Let's figure out who the vaccinated human is first.

2037
01:20:14,046 --> 01:20:16,540
Can't they just say it?

2038
01:20:16,548 --> 01:20:18,550
Can't they just say that they're the vaccinated human?

2039
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:19,750
- Say it. - All right.

2040
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:21,310
- Say it. - I am the vaccinated human.

2041
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:22,520
(I am the vaccinated human.)

2042
01:20:22,521 --> 01:20:23,620
(When Jae Seok confesses that he is the vaccinated human...)

2043
01:20:23,622 --> 01:20:25,120
- I am the vaccinated human. - It's me.

2044
01:20:25,123 --> 01:20:27,450
(Three more people raise their hands.)

2045
01:20:27,459 --> 01:20:29,820
- This is driving me crazy. - I really am the vaccinated human.

2046
01:20:29,828 --> 01:20:32,290
- Stop it. - I'm serious. Look at the hints.

2047
01:20:32,297 --> 01:20:35,075
- Think about the hints. - I really am the vaccinated human.

2048
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,000
Stop it already.

2049
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:39,000
- Think about the hints. - Stop it.

2050
01:20:39,004 --> 01:20:41,670
I am the vaccinated human.

2051
01:20:41,673 --> 01:20:43,500
- The vaccinated human? - Yes.

2052
01:20:43,508 --> 01:20:46,010
- It's me. - Don't be absurd. It's me.

2053
01:20:46,011 --> 01:20:47,510
I am the vaccinated human.

2054
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:50,355
Come on. You are a zombie!

2055
01:20:50,515 --> 01:20:52,955
Which hints have you received?

2056
01:20:53,018 --> 01:20:54,920
The vaccinated human has a sister.

2057
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,750
I have a sister named Song Da Na who is a year younger than me.

2058
01:20:57,756 --> 01:20:59,120
(He reveals her real name.)

2059
01:20:59,124 --> 01:21:00,420
My younger sister's name is Lee Bo Ram.

2060
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:01,760
(He reveals her real name as well.)

2061
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,220
- I am the eldest child. - I am the eldest child as well.

2062
01:21:03,228 --> 01:21:05,930
I have a hidden sister. I have never talked about her on TV.

2063
01:21:05,931 --> 01:21:07,230
(She suddenly makes a confession.)

2064
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:10,745
- My father has... - Be quiet!

2065
01:21:11,336 --> 01:21:13,400
I was being serious. Be quiet.

2066
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:14,530
I am telling you the truth.

2067
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:18,640
So Min, the vaccinated human is a man.

2068
01:21:18,643 --> 01:21:19,940
Actually, I am...

2069
01:21:19,945 --> 01:21:22,185
(She suddenly makes a 2nd confession.)

2070
01:21:23,715 --> 01:21:25,650
- What? - The vaccinated human...

2071
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:27,010
What are you doing?

2072
01:21:27,018 --> 01:21:28,995
(Min Ho is shocked.)

2073
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:32,720
I am a man. I am a man.

2074
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:34,620
- She is completely crazy. - She is...

2075
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:37,220
- That's our show's psycho. - She is really crazy.

2076
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:39,675
- She is incredible. - She is completely crazy.

2077
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:43,130
- She is incredible. - Right? Isn't she unbelievable?

2078
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:46,630
One thing is certain. I told you that there are...

2079
01:21:46,638 --> 01:21:49,840
male and female contagious zombies. The female one is Hye Jeong.

2080
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:52,640
- That's right. - I am certain of it.

2081
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:54,710
Hye Jeong is a wretch.

2082
01:21:54,713 --> 01:21:57,480
- That couple should go up. - That's right.

2083
01:21:57,482 --> 01:21:58,610
- That couple has to go up. - Right.

2084
01:21:58,617 --> 01:22:01,920
Jae Seok and Min Ho...

2085
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,520
could either be the vaccinated human or a contagious zombie,

2086
01:22:05,524 --> 01:22:08,520
- so we can't choose both of them. - That would be a disaster.

2087
01:22:08,527 --> 01:22:10,390
We can't choose both of them. We have to determine what they are.

2088
01:22:10,395 --> 01:22:13,660
How about this? Take turns, and convince us...

2089
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:15,260
why you are the vaccinated human.

2090
01:22:15,267 --> 01:22:19,900
I wasn't sure about the rules. I am not good at complicated games.

2091
01:22:19,905 --> 01:22:22,240
The heavy burden of being the vaccinated human kept me...

2092
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,770
- from revealing my identity. - He is honest.

2093
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:27,240
- That was against the rules. - I mean,

2094
01:22:27,245 --> 01:22:30,880
I couldn't participate actively. I was under a lot of pressure.

2095
01:22:30,882 --> 01:22:31,880
(Min Ho explains.)

2096
01:22:31,883 --> 01:22:35,120
I treated Kwang Soo. I did it in the middle of the game.

2097
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,380
I thought only one member would become human.

2098
01:22:37,389 --> 01:22:38,990
How do you treat a zombie?

2099
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:41,190
This is how you do it. As you saw earlier...

2100
01:22:41,193 --> 01:22:43,320
- Don't say it first. - Don't say it.

2101
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,660
- You shouldn't say it. - How do you treat a zombie?

2102
01:22:46,665 --> 01:22:48,730
- Say it at the same time. - Say it at the same time.

2103
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:51,330
- Shall we say it at the same time? - Say it at the same time.

2104
01:22:51,336 --> 01:22:53,670
- Shall we do that? - 1, 2, 3.

2105
01:22:53,672 --> 01:22:56,140
(They are both confident, but do they know the answer?)

2106
01:22:56,141 --> 01:22:57,140
- Touch. - The character board.

2107
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:58,640
That's right. You touch the character board.

2108
01:22:58,643 --> 01:23:00,140
(Touch versus the character board)

2109
01:23:00,145 --> 01:23:01,210
You touch the character board.

2110
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:03,810
(This is how the vaccinated human treated a zombie.)

2111
01:23:03,815 --> 01:23:07,180
You need to touch the character board.

2112
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:09,720
- That treats a zombie? - Yes.

2113
01:23:09,721 --> 01:23:11,620
- The contagious zombies might know. - How?

2114
01:23:11,623 --> 01:23:13,720
Do contagious zombies know about touching the character board?

2115
01:23:13,725 --> 01:23:16,120
- No, they don't. - I don't know what they know.

2116
01:23:16,127 --> 01:23:18,760
How does a contagious zombie infected a human?

2117
01:23:18,763 --> 01:23:20,930
- I don't know that. - It must be by touch.

2118
01:23:20,932 --> 01:23:22,605
It must be by touch as well!

2119
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:24,530
- It must be by touch as well! - I can't believe you.

2120
01:23:24,536 --> 01:23:25,570
(They point fingers at each other.)

2121
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:28,440
- That's how you infect people. - What are you talking about?

2122
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,515
Min Ho, did you turn Kwang Soo into a human?

2123
01:23:31,643 --> 01:23:34,070
I touched Kwang Soo and made him human again.

2124
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:35,310
However, I didn't know...

2125
01:23:35,313 --> 01:23:38,510
Seung Yoon would also become human.

2126
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:40,350
I only treated Kwang Soo.

2127
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:42,120
(Min Ho stands up for himself.)

2128
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,750
(He doesn't understand why Seung Yoon became human.)

2129
01:23:43,755 --> 01:23:46,750
- That's right. Hold on. - I don't understand.

2130
01:23:46,758 --> 01:23:48,835
- I don't know what happened either. - Hold on.

2131
01:23:49,094 --> 01:23:51,020
- Why did I become human? - This is what I know.

2132
01:23:51,029 --> 01:23:54,730
After I became human, Min Ho came to me and said that...

2133
01:23:54,733 --> 01:23:56,805
he made me human.

2134
01:23:56,835 --> 01:23:59,030
Jae Seok said until the end,

2135
01:23:59,037 --> 01:24:03,585
"You zombie!"

2136
01:24:03,942 --> 01:24:06,455
You should know that. It's a fact.

2137
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:09,010
He said it as we came up the stairs when there were no cameras.

2138
01:24:09,014 --> 01:24:11,510
- He grabbed my collar and said, - I can explain.

2139
01:24:11,516 --> 01:24:14,380
- "You dirty zombie!" - I can explain why I said that.

2140
01:24:14,386 --> 01:24:16,320
I didn't treat Kwang Soo.

2141
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:18,620
(It's a big plot twist.)

2142
01:24:18,623 --> 01:24:22,805
(Jae Seok confesses that he didn't treat Kwang Soo.)

2143
01:24:23,528 --> 01:24:26,390
(It's the complete opposite of Min Ho's claim.)

2144
01:24:26,398 --> 01:24:28,630
- Whom did you treat? - I treated Seung Yoon.

2145
01:24:28,633 --> 01:24:31,200
(He says he treated Seung Yoon.)

2146
01:24:31,202 --> 01:24:33,945
- Are there 2 vaccinated humans? - No, there is only 1.

2147
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:37,500
Gosh, you are really smart.

2148
01:24:37,509 --> 01:24:40,040
I am not lying. That's why...

2149
01:24:40,045 --> 01:24:42,380
I called Kwang Soo a zombie. I don't know how...

2150
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:44,785
Kwang Soo became human.

2151
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:46,810
Their stories are essentially the same.

2152
01:24:46,818 --> 01:24:48,995
(Only the people they treated are different.)

2153
01:24:49,187 --> 01:24:52,735
I think it's hilarious how Hye Jeong is staying still...

2154
01:24:52,824 --> 01:24:54,990
despite this heated debate.

2155
01:24:54,993 --> 01:24:57,090
(Everyone knows she is the female contagious zombie.)

2156
01:24:57,095 --> 01:25:00,430
- She acknowledged it. - "Yes, I am a contagious zombie."

2157
01:25:00,432 --> 01:25:03,730
She won't even make excuses. She accepted her fate.

2158
01:25:03,735 --> 01:25:06,630
I asked Hye Jeong, "Shouldn't you defend yourself?"

2159
01:25:06,638 --> 01:25:08,500
She said, "They won't listen."

2160
01:25:08,506 --> 01:25:10,570
We are done. We will go up the platform.

2161
01:25:10,575 --> 01:25:13,215
I was Hye Jeong's partner. I asked her,

2162
01:25:13,345 --> 01:25:16,425
"How could you do this to me?"

2163
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:20,525
She pretended not to hear me. She completely ignored me.

2164
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:22,620
- It's time to make a decision. - Okay.

2165
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:24,920
- Go up. - Hold on. Hold on.

2166
01:25:24,923 --> 01:25:27,650
Hye Jeong, tell them that you aren't a contagious zombie.

2167
01:25:27,659 --> 01:25:30,090
Go up there already! We don't have much time.

2168
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:33,560
You should still hear what she has to say. Tell them.

2169
01:25:33,565 --> 01:25:36,875
- Let's hear it. - Please give...

2170
01:25:36,901 --> 01:25:40,600
"Bingle Bangle" by AOA a lot of love.

2171
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:43,740
- Go up there. - I can't believe you!

2172
01:25:43,742 --> 01:25:45,510
She gave up. She gave up.

2173
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,410
We just need to choose between Jae Seok and Min Ho.

2174
01:25:47,412 --> 01:25:50,510
Going up there isn't a problem but...

2175
01:25:50,515 --> 01:25:51,750
(Only one of them goes up the platform.)

2176
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:54,795
- We need to choose another couple. - It can be any couple.

2177
01:25:54,919 --> 01:25:58,020
Min Ho shouldn't go up the platform.

2178
01:25:58,022 --> 01:26:00,920
No, no. It's Jae Seok.

2179
01:26:00,925 --> 01:26:03,190
- Go up there. - Go up there.

2180
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:05,760
You never know what will happen. Go up.

2181
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:07,630
- Let's go. - Zombies go up there, right?

2182
01:26:07,632 --> 01:26:10,660
- Aren't you the vaccinated human? - This is...

2183
01:26:10,668 --> 01:26:12,730
- Go up there. - Joo E.

2184
01:26:12,737 --> 01:26:14,570
I am the vaccinated human.

2185
01:26:14,572 --> 01:26:17,285
(If he is the vaccinated human, Team Humans lose.)

2186
01:26:17,642 --> 01:26:20,010
Jong Kook and Seol Hyun should go since they are humans for sure.

2187
01:26:20,011 --> 01:26:22,010
- Seol Hyun... - I am not sure about her.

2188
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:23,340
- That's right. - Me?

2189
01:26:23,348 --> 01:26:25,480
- Seol Hyun, let's go up. - Go up.

2190
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:27,610
- Let's go up. - They are humans.

2191
01:26:27,619 --> 01:26:29,520
It'd be incredible if there's a twist.

2192
01:26:29,521 --> 01:26:32,735
(Between the two of them, who is the contagious zombie?)

2193
01:26:32,924 --> 01:26:34,020
The name tags will be removed.

2194
01:26:34,025 --> 01:26:36,820
1, 2, 3.

2195
01:26:36,828 --> 01:26:37,890
(Contagious zombie)

2196
01:26:37,896 --> 01:26:38,890
(Hye Jeong is a contagious zombie.)

2197
01:26:38,897 --> 01:26:41,405
- That's right. - We knew it.

2198
01:26:41,499 --> 01:26:43,260
- I told you Seol Hyun is human. - What is this?

2199
01:26:43,268 --> 01:26:45,815
Don't make Hye Jeong do something like this.

2200
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,400
(Contagious Zombie B, Hye Jeong, is apprehended.)

2201
01:26:47,405 --> 01:26:49,815
All right.

2202
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:51,940
If Jae Seok is a contagious zombie, Team Humans wins.

2203
01:26:51,943 --> 01:26:54,640
- This is the most... - If he is the vaccinated human,

2204
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:56,210
- Team Humans loses. - This is...

2205
01:26:56,214 --> 01:27:00,725
(If he is the vaccinated human, Team Humans loses.)

2206
01:27:01,252 --> 01:27:04,420
1, 2, 3.

2207
01:27:04,422 --> 01:27:09,390
(What is Jae Seok?)

2208
01:27:09,394 --> 01:27:12,560
1, 2, 3.

2209
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:17,605
(What is Jae Seok?)

2210
01:27:19,304 --> 01:27:23,700
(Jae Seok is a contagious zombie.)

2211
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:26,640
(Team Humans wins.)

2212
01:27:26,644 --> 01:27:28,315
I am sorry, Joo E.

2213
01:27:29,147 --> 01:27:32,080
- We won! - Remove Min Ho's name tag.

2214
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,480
- Good job. - 1, 2, 3.

2215
01:27:34,486 --> 01:27:36,750
(Min Ho was the vaccinated human.)

2216
01:27:36,754 --> 01:27:38,495
- Min Ho! - Min Ho!

2217
01:27:40,758 --> 01:27:42,820
Today, we will have the Zombie Couple Race.

2218
01:27:42,827 --> 01:27:46,735
- You are the vaccinated human. - The vaccinated human?

2219
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:50,900
(Before the final race ended, )

2220
01:27:50,902 --> 01:27:54,200
(he treated Kwang Soo by touching the character board.)

2221
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:56,745
(He kept his identity hidden and completed the mission.)

2222
01:27:56,875 --> 01:27:59,440
Thus, Team Humans wins.

2223
01:27:59,444 --> 01:28:01,710
(Team Humans wins.)

2224
01:28:01,713 --> 01:28:03,310
Nice!

2225
01:28:03,314 --> 01:28:05,480
(It's all thanks to Min Ho's work and the humans' deductions.)

2226
01:28:05,483 --> 01:28:10,280
- Hye Jeong. - I was given an important role,

2227
01:28:10,288 --> 01:28:13,890
but the rules were too complicated and hard.

2228
01:28:13,892 --> 01:28:16,190
When I met Hye Jeong in the morning as a fellow zombie,

2229
01:28:16,194 --> 01:28:19,560
I said, "Let's ignore each other." She really ignored me.

2230
01:28:19,564 --> 01:28:21,660
(Until the very end)

2231
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:24,230
She didn't even look in my direction.

2232
01:28:24,235 --> 01:28:26,930
We should have met up and come up with a plan,

2233
01:28:26,938 --> 01:28:28,845
but she didn't even look in my direction.

2234
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:30,440
- Bye. - Thank you.

2235
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:32,370
- Thank you. - Bye.

2236
01:28:32,377 --> 01:28:34,585
- Bye. - Thank you.

2237
01:28:36,014 --> 01:28:37,840
(For each other, )

2238
01:28:37,849 --> 01:28:40,350
(the Running Man members prepare heartfelt presents.)

2239
01:28:40,351 --> 01:28:44,850
(The presents give them touching and healing moments.)

2240
01:28:44,856 --> 01:28:46,450
- Thank you. - I love it.

2241
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:48,390
(The items they were given...)

2242
01:28:48,393 --> 01:28:50,520
(are the only things they can use.)

2243
01:28:50,528 --> 01:28:52,660
(How are we supposed to live with only these items?)

2244
01:28:52,664 --> 01:28:54,560
(A bottle of water costs...)

2245
01:28:54,566 --> 01:28:56,430
(500 dollars.)

2246
01:28:56,434 --> 01:29:00,200
(The invisible hand makes the prices skyrocket.)

2247
01:29:00,204 --> 01:29:01,700
(I have fire.)

2248
01:29:01,706 --> 01:29:04,170
(Ownership is power.)

2249
01:29:04,175 --> 01:29:06,555
(How much does it cost to boil water?)

2250
01:29:07,445 --> 01:29:09,010
(How much can you offer?)

2251
01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:11,555
(The principles of market economy divide the power.)

2252
01:29:11,616 --> 01:29:14,755
(A small thing can bring a big amount of power.)

2253
01:29:15,286 --> 01:29:17,050
(Between greed and moderation, )

2254
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:19,295
(the members get lost.)

2255
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:24,105
(What is the cruel end of this catastrophe?)

2256
01:29:24,963 --> 01:29:26,575
(This high?)

2257
01:29:30,268 --> 01:29:32,715
(War of Money)
