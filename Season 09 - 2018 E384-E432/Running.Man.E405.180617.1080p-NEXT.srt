1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,280
(9th summer on Running Man)

2
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,650
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,880
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

4
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:18,920
We're in Iksan, North Jeolla Province.

5
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:21,120
- Iksan. - The weather is great.

6
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:23,360
This is my sister-in-law's hometown.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,920
- Is that so? - Yes.

8
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:28,090
Wait, I've never met your sister-in-law.

9
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,160
- Is this her hometown? - I have a sister-in-law.

10
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,060
- It's my friend's hometown. - Really?

11
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,830
It's home for many people.

12
00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:35,630
- It's my distant cousin's hometown. - Everyone knows someone.

13
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,140
- My sister-in-law's hometown. - Since it's her hometown,

14
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,470
- make an acrostic poem with Iksan. - Okay.

15
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:42,255
- Come on. - Okay.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,210
- That's out of the blue. - Seok Jin is getting prepared.

17
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:46,650
- Am I next? - Really?

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,825
- Ik. - All right, Ik.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,335
- "It's getting ripe." - That's good.

20
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,750
- San. - "I must climb up a mountain."

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,260
(It's getting ripe. I must climb up a mountain.)

22
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,790
That's good. Good shot.

23
00:00:59,796 --> 00:01:01,560
- Good shot. - Okay.

24
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:04,060
- Good shot. - You started it in 10 seconds.

25
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,360
- He's so sly. - What do you mean?

26
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:08,630
- It wasn't even good. - Good shot.

27
00:01:08,638 --> 00:01:11,400
- Gosh, I saw someone... - He thinks it was.

28
00:01:11,408 --> 00:01:14,085
making a bitter smile. It was So Min.

29
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:16,740
- Look at her facial expression. - I already know.

30
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:19,540
I was shaking Se Chan's hand, but I was looking at her.

31
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,310
- She gave him a look. - You should be careful.

32
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:23,965
- Did she make you upset? - I don't like her.

33
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:27,220
- By the way, Seok Jin has... - I feel a lot of pressure.

34
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:29,350
- a friend in Iksan. - Is that so?

35
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,120
- You started as a comedian. - Don't do that.

36
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:34,460
- Right. - How can I make one with Iksan?

37
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,130
What can I make a poem with Iksan?

38
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:38,300
Yes, you're less experienced than me.

39
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:39,360
- I can't think of any. - Be quiet.

40
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,030
- Be quiet, everyone. - I can't think of any.

41
00:01:41,037 --> 00:01:43,585
- Be careful not to fall. - Get ready to laugh.

42
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:44,970
Ik.

43
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,185
(An experienced comedian shows off his talent.)

44
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:48,110
"I'm used to this atmosphere."

45
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:50,380
(I'm used to this atmosphere.)

46
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,680
(Impressed)

47
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:52,680
San.

48
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:53,995
(Here comes the last line.)

49
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,350
- San. - "I need a drink of Cornus fruit."

50
00:01:56,353 --> 00:01:59,765
(I need a drink of Cornus fruit.)

51
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,120
(Disappointed)

52
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:02,750
Isn't it predictable?

53
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,260
- What do you mean? - Listen.

54
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,620
How is it different from "climbing up a mountain"?

55
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:08,730
- You give it a try then. - Goodness.

56
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:09,890
- Say "Ik". - Ik.

57
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,760
- "Excuse me." - That's good.

58
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,900
(That sounds original.)

59
00:02:14,904 --> 00:02:15,900
San.

60
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:17,855
(Jae Seok shows off his talent to Seok Jin.)

61
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,970
"Sansei, excuse me."

62
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,070
(We assume that he meant "teacher".)

63
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:24,955
"Sansei, excuse me."

64
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:26,780
- "Sansei", "dojo". - You're speaking Japanese.

65
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,110
- Dojo. - "Dojo"?

66
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:32,350
- You can't speak Japanese. - Stop it.

67
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:35,350
Today, we came to a historic site from Baekje.

68
00:02:35,358 --> 00:02:37,605
It was selected by UNESCO.

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,020
Look at that.

70
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,560
- This is great. - It's a historic site.

71
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,360
- Mireuksa Temple Site. - Mireuksa Temple Site.

72
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:45,775
It's National Treasure Number 11, Mireuksa Temple.

73
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,670
It's a World Heritage site selected by UNESCO.

74
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:51,470
- Really? - I've never seen it before.

75
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,840
When I mentioned Mireuksa Temple, this is what Se Chan said.

76
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:57,780
- He's interested a lot in history. - Does he know about the temple?

77
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:00,480
When I said that I'm happy to visit Mireuksa Temple,

78
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,580
he said, "This is where Gung Ye used to live."

79
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:04,665
(This is where Gung Ye used to live.)

80
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,920
I recognized it from the word "mireuk".

81
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,890
- I wondered where we were. - "I know how to read people."

82
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:10,990
- I mistook it as Gung Ye's place. - "I'm Mireuk."

83
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,730
He thought it was where Gung Ye lived.

84
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,960
- Why did you bring it up? - Why not?

85
00:03:15,965 --> 00:03:18,030
- Why did you say that? - It's embarrassing.

86
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:20,370
He's the most ignorant among us.

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,300
- Right. - You're the most ignorant.

88
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,300
We invited four guests who will be with you...

89
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,840
- here today. - Really?

90
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:31,580
Look, the color is pink.

91
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:34,395
- It's a heart. - Who will be today's guests?

92
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,180
- What? - What's going on? Look.

93
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,495
What's that?

94
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:41,735
(Who's the first special guest?)

95
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,875
- It's Son Dam Bi. - Dam Bi.

96
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:48,390
- It's Dam Bi. - Who is it?

97
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:50,105
- It's Son Dam Bi. - Son Dam Bi?

98
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,045
- It's really Dam Bi. - Is it Dam Bi?

99
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,570
- Dam Bi is here. - I can't believe it.

100
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:56,670
- Hello. - She pretends to be bubbly.

101
00:03:56,673 --> 00:03:59,170
- Dam Bi. - She's pretty.

102
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:00,840
- Hello. - Dam Bi.

103
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,110
- Hello. - I saw you at Nam Mountain.

104
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,310
- That was the second episode. - Right.

105
00:04:04,314 --> 00:04:07,410
- Long time no see. - Hello.

106
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,150
- She's still pretty. - As Kwang Soo mentioned,

107
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:12,495
Dam Bi looked expressionless when she was waiting.

108
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:13,790
But when she got out of the tent...

109
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,290
She pretended to be all bubbly.

110
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,390
- It looked mechanical. - Seriously.

111
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:19,305
It's been so long since I saw someone spin like this.

112
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:22,890
- Goodness. - She's been on TV for 10 years now.

113
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,600
- Yes, it's been over a decade. - We filmed a movie together.

114
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,430
- Dam Bi... - They filmed a movie together.

115
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,670
- filmed a movie with Kwang Soo. - My gosh.

116
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,840
- Yes, I did. - "The Accidental Detective 2"?

117
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,085
- We also filmed "Rose of Betrayal". - That's right.

118
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,240
- Our two movies will be out. - They'll be out in June and August.

119
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,240
- Really? - I see.

120
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,580
Do you play his love interest?

121
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,710
No way.

122
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:41,910
(She's appalled.)

123
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:43,150
(You didn't have to say it like that.)

124
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:45,180
- I shouldn't have said that. - Was that necessary?

125
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:48,505
- Did you not see her? - She's offended.

126
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,560
We have to sympathize if they're a couple in the film.

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,020
- But we can't sympathize at all. - Let me just put it simply.

128
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,290
- You're just friends, right? - I see.

129
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:55,760
- He's just an acquaintance. - Yes.

130
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:57,130
I'm just a passer-by.

131
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,430
(He has given up.)

132
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,300
- That's the perfect role. - Now, I get it, Kwang Soo.

133
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,370
- Right. - He just passes by.

134
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:05,600
She was greatly loved with her song, "Saturday Night".

135
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:07,140
- That's right. - She's here on a Sunday night now.

136
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:08,470
- This is great. - Thank you.

137
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,010
- Saturday night - Saturday night

138
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:12,810
I'm sorry, but you don't have a Saturday show now.

139
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:15,165
(I'm sorry, but you don't have a Saturday show now.)

140
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,550
- Hey. - You keep mentioning Saturday.

141
00:05:17,554 --> 00:05:19,250
That won't last forever though.

142
00:05:19,255 --> 00:05:20,820
- But you don't have work. - Right.

143
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,520
- Goodness. - You should give...

144
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,020
- other people a chance. - We won't be on a break forever.

145
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:26,690
- Haha is lowering his head. - My goodness.

146
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:29,605
Gosh, Haha. He still hasn't gotten over the shock.

147
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,175
(He does a sudden gesture.)

148
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,015
(Choking up)

149
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:36,500
You were doing a palm blast, right?

150
00:05:36,506 --> 00:05:37,800
- Wave motion fist. - Wave motion fist.

151
00:05:37,807 --> 00:05:40,540
(They does their Saturday wave motion fist all they want.)

152
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:41,640
(You haven't forgotten about us, right?)

153
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:43,880
- That's a palm blast, right? - It's a wave motion fist now.

154
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,540
- Should I leave my Thursdays open? - What?

155
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:46,955
- Wave motion fist. - Wave motion fist.

156
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,180
- You guys are hilarious. - All right.

157
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:53,990
By the way, compared to that time eight years ago,

158
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,320
she started mumbling more than before.

159
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,520
- Really. - I'm getting old.

160
00:05:57,527 --> 00:05:59,420
- But I prefer this. - Is that so?

161
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,290
She keeps saying, "That's ridiculous. Look at him."

162
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:04,900
- It's been eight years. - Before, she'd be quiet.

163
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,700
- She didn't do much. - I followed my agency's advice.

164
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,270
She didn't even talk much when I asked her questions.

165
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:09,970
And the sound of her laugh changed.

166
00:06:09,973 --> 00:06:11,200
She chuckles like a man.

167
00:06:11,207 --> 00:06:13,100
(The sound of her laugh changed. She chuckles like a man.)

168
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:15,140
- A man? Really, Seok Jin? - See? Did you hear that?

169
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:16,410
- It sounds like that a bit. - A man.

170
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,040
- It's very... - I'm a single woman. How could you?

171
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:20,010
- We like it. - I just meant that we liked that.

172
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,865
You seem very easy-to-earth.

173
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,495
I'm sorry,

174
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,180
- what does, "easy-to-earth" mean? - What?

175
00:06:25,188 --> 00:06:26,550
- Easy-to-earth. - Did you mean, "down-to-earth"?

176
00:06:26,556 --> 00:06:28,520
- Down-to-earth. - She's down-to-earth and easygoing.

177
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:30,165
Down-to-earth and easygoing.

178
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:32,160
- I jumbled up two expressions. - I like that.

179
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,930
Because we were so happy to see Dam Bi,

180
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:37,560
- we ended up interviewing her. - Right.

181
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,900
- We'll do it after everyone is out. - When everyone is introduced? Okay.

182
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:42,900
- It's been a while. - I'm looking forward to today.

183
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,700
Dam Bi started us off. How high should my expectations be?

184
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:48,040
My goodness.

185
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,570
- The thing about Seok Jin is... - This is crazy.

186
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,710
that he never says things with an ounce of sincerity.

187
00:06:51,714 --> 00:06:53,540
- But I should say these things. - Do you think he meant it?

188
00:06:53,549 --> 00:06:55,550
- I thought he was Alpha Go. - I'm flattering the guest.

189
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,350
- "Dam Bi started us off." - I should, shouldn't I?

190
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:00,350
- It feels nice, doesn't it? Right? - "I'm looking forward to today."

191
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,390
I'm trying to flatter the guest at the age of 50.

192
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:06,775
- You're not 50. You're 54. - Be quiet. It's 53!

193
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,590
- Are you 53 years old? - Yes.

194
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:09,730
They're unstoppable.

195
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:12,830
- We'll move onto the next guest. - Okay.

196
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:14,985
- The next guest. - Here's the next guest.

197
00:07:16,272 --> 00:07:18,770
(The second guest has a cute silhouette.)

198
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:19,770
Who is it?

199
00:07:19,776 --> 00:07:23,370
(Who is the second guest that brings out their sincere reactions?)

200
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:24,655
Who is it?

201
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,640
It's Seo Eun Su.

202
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,150
(Actress Seo Eun Su, the symbol of innocence and cuteness)

203
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:31,150
(She appeared in "My Golden Life" and "Dr. Romantic".)

204
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,505
(This popular actress has been in many recent hit-dramas.)

205
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,890
- Hello. - Hi.

206
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:37,420
- Hi. - Gosh, hello.

207
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:39,560
- Nice to meet you. Come this way. - Hello.

208
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:40,760
Eun Su.

209
00:07:40,763 --> 00:07:42,475
- Goodness. - My gosh.

210
00:07:42,632 --> 00:07:44,830
- Seriously. - You were in "My Golden Life".

211
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,060
- That's right. - Kwang Soo.

212
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,770
- He knew the exact title. - That's right.

213
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,515
- He watches every drama. - I do.

214
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,000
Haha asked...

215
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:54,725
if she played a golden role in "My Golden Life".

216
00:07:55,578 --> 00:07:56,610
Stay out of it.

217
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,725
- She had the "golden" role. - Don't get involved.

218
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:01,310
This is Eun Su's first variety show.

219
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:03,980
People usually can't sleep the night before their first show.

220
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:06,580
- I... I couldn't sleep. - How long did you sleep?

221
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,390
- I... I slept for 2 hours. - 2 hours.

222
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,890
- She kept saying she was nervous. - I think she's really nervous.

223
00:08:10,893 --> 00:08:12,520
- I'm so sweaty. - Don't worry.

224
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:14,960
- She's one of the youngest members. - That's right. She is.

225
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:17,130
- Eun Su is nervous about the show. - Right.

226
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,500
- Give her helpful advice. - Talk to her.

227
00:08:19,502 --> 00:08:21,530
- Kwang Soo, say something. - Okay.

228
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:24,085
Just have fun, trust us, and follow our lead.

229
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:27,425
- You just focus on doing your job. - She should trust you?

230
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:28,940
Goodness.

231
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,740
You're so frustrating. This is really frustrating.

232
00:08:31,748 --> 00:08:33,310
You're very tall.

233
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:35,410
(She carefully asks a question.)

234
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,610
Kwang Soo? He's really tall.

235
00:08:36,619 --> 00:08:38,835
She's not your love interest. Don't take it the wrong way.

236
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:41,250
(Will I have a love interest today?)

237
00:08:41,257 --> 00:08:44,375
- Tell me now. What will you do? - Don't get the wrong idea.

238
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:46,160
- So... - Do you not like me?

239
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,730
He'll get the wrong idea. Don't say that. He'll misunderstand.

240
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:50,190
- It will really happen. - It will happen.

241
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,260
- Don't give him your number. - Dam Bi.

242
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:53,030
Dam Bi, what do you think? Do you think he has a shot?

243
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,630
Not even close.

244
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:56,700
"Not even close"?

245
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:59,240
- Her answer was so blunt. - How could she say that?

246
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:01,240
- Goodness, Dam Bi. - Her answer stays to the truth.

247
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,310
- She's like Geum Bo Ra. - That was excellent.

248
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:04,710
Geum Bo Ra?

249
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:07,080
- How do I sound like Bo Ra? - I mean it.

250
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,680
- I really liked that answer. - I knew it.

251
00:09:08,684 --> 00:09:10,250
She's back after eight years with awesome talking skills.

252
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,065
It's like she fermented her skills in a nice oak barrel.

253
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,850
- It's like wine. - Eight-year-old wine.

254
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:14,890
- It's like wine. - I'm serious.

255
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:16,820
- She's great at talking now. - I agree.

256
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,505
- I love it. - Look forward to it.

257
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:22,690
Eun Su, you must be nervous since it's your first variety show.

258
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:24,645
Just like Dam Bi who's standing next to you,

259
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,645
- follow her lead. - Come back after eight years.

260
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,485
Eight years?

261
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:29,900
- Follow her lead. - Come back after eight years.

262
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:32,270
- Eight years? - Ferment it in the oak barrel.

263
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,210
After today's shoot, I'll be back eight years later.

264
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,610
- Just like doenjang. - You told her to come back later.

265
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,325
- I'm "not even close." - "Not even close."

266
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:40,710
(Eun Su seems promising.)

267
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,080
Everyone,

268
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:44,920
- we'll introduce the next guest. - Okay. Let's do that.

269
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:46,265
All right. Come on out!

270
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,620
Who is it?

271
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:52,260
(The third special guest appears with a cheerful song.)

272
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:54,030
It's Gyeong Ree!

273
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,605
(Gyeong Ree from 9muses, Ms. Perfect)

274
00:09:55,631 --> 00:09:59,415
(She becomes a sexy queen that excites men on stage.)

275
00:09:59,836 --> 00:10:02,100
(Compared to her competitiveness, due to her weak strength,)

276
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:04,770
(she thrived on variety shows as Paper Human.)

277
00:10:04,774 --> 00:10:05,900
(She doesn't spare herself.)

278
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:08,070
(She's an adorable guest the members admire.)

279
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:09,940
- It's Gyeong Ree! - Gyeong Ree!

280
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:12,495
- Gyeong Ree. - It's been so long.

281
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,610
- Long time no see, Gyeong Ree. - Gyeong Ree.

282
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,750
- We were at the sea that time. - We haven't seen her...

283
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:18,850
- at a place like this before. - Right.

284
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:21,765
When she came out, he didn't know. He asked me who she was.

285
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,060
- I thought you said, Gyeon Ree. - What's wrong with you?

286
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,220
- I thought she was Kyeon Mi Ri. - Gyeon Ree?

287
00:10:25,228 --> 00:10:27,135
(I thought she was Kyeon Mi Ri.)

288
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,790
- Listen. - She was coming toward us.

289
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,360
- What are you talking about? - It was the pronunciation.

290
00:10:30,366 --> 00:10:32,815
- I thought you said Kyeon Mi Ri. - What's wrong with him?

291
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:35,330
- And Mi Ri is quite old. - By the way, Ji Hyo,

292
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:38,000
you haven't said anything today, but your eyes are doing the talking.

293
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,655
Didn't you say, "Has he gone mad?"

294
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:42,755
- I say your eyes just now. - I thought he had gone mad.

295
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,940
I thought Mi Ri had a nice silhouette.

296
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,340
- How could... - All right.

297
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,850
Gyeong Ree is joining us today.

298
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,650
- We'll introduce the last guest. - Okay.

299
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,820
This is the important point. It's really hot.

300
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:53,935
- Right. - An actress is inside.

301
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,490
- You can look forward to it. - She's sweating a lot.

302
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:57,490
- Really? - We should hurry then.

303
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,120
- Really? Eun Su, you're smiling. - Sorry?

304
00:10:59,128 --> 00:11:00,890
- I can't wait. - You can't wait?

305
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:02,130
- I seriously can't wait. - Is that so?

306
00:11:02,131 --> 00:11:03,560
- This great actress is... - Okay, okay.

307
00:11:03,566 --> 00:11:04,860
- sweating profusely. - She's the last one too.

308
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,445
Let me introduce the last guest.

309
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,270
- Park Ji Yoon? - This is "Adult Ceremony".

310
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:12,200
(A great actress who suits "Adult Ceremony"?)

311
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,425
(The grand, last guest)

312
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:20,195
- Ms. Slurping. - Ms. Slurping.

313
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:22,525
(It's... It's Gook Ju.)

314
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,380
All right. Let's get it!

315
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:26,535
It's been a long time. It's been a while since she came.

316
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:29,520
(The great actress shows off her charms.)

317
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,990
She's the best dancer. She is the best indeed.

318
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:34,560
- She's the best. - It's really hot. It's so hot.

319
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:36,445
(The grand, last guest is Gook Ju, Ms. Slurping.)

320
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,815
- It can't come off already. - Come on, Ms. Slurping.

321
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,540
- What's that? What is this? - That was so sudden.

322
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:47,740
- What's up with your hair? - What was that?

323
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,070
She pulled out her hair.

324
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:51,295
- What was it? - Why did you pull out your hair?

325
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,540
- Her hair came off. - What?

326
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,465
- Something came off. - This...

327
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,680
- I have a few more here. - This.

328
00:11:58,688 --> 00:12:00,020
- Three of them managed to stay on. - You put on the hair pieces.

329
00:12:00,022 --> 00:12:01,365
Then I'll put this on.

330
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,520
- My gosh. - G-Dragon.

331
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:05,990
(Yu-Dragon)

332
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:08,690
- Fantastic, baby, dance - You're G-Dragon.

333
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,875
(G-Dragon, who's in the army, might be appalled at this sight.)

334
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,500
See? I told you so.

335
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:14,830
- They're busy trying to be funny. - Right.

336
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:17,315
I brought this, so I can wear it.

337
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,110
All right. Please welcome Gook Ju.

338
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,525
(Lee Gook Ju, the laughter generator)

339
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,740
Gook Ju is known for...

340
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:27,280
- her legendary lines. - Right.

341
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,650
- She said many, funny lines. - There are tons.

342
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:32,980
"Kwang Soo, take care of your toenail." The rotten toenail.

343
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,635
- She said that to me. - He's under Toenail Kwang Soo.

344
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,460
(There's a painful secret behind Kwang Soo's toenails.)

345
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,860
(In July of 2015, Kwang Soo and Gook Ju had to partner up.)

346
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:43,730
(His toenails are rotting away!)

347
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,700
(She refused to pair up with him due to his rotten toenails.)

348
00:12:46,702 --> 00:12:49,900
(Gook Ju made Kwang Soo take care of his toenails.)

349
00:12:49,905 --> 00:12:51,840
- They're fine now. Yes. - Really?

350
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,900
- Kwang Soo's rotten toenails. - Right.

351
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:56,840
- Viewers, they're not rotten. - He can't find shoes in his size.

352
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:59,540
Anyway, including Gook Ju,

353
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:01,380
these four guests are joining us today.

354
00:13:01,384 --> 00:13:02,725
(The special guests are all introduced.)

355
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:05,620
Today's race...

356
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:07,320
will unfold in Iksan, Buyeo, and Gongju...

357
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,620
which are considered the Baekje Historic Areas.

358
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:12,520
Today's race is Don't Trust Them: Thieves Race.

359
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:14,230
(Don't Trust Them: Thieves Race)

360
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,890
"Don't Trust Them"? There are thieves?

361
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,500
(There must be something hidden in the race.)

362
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,830
- It will be a couple race today. - It's a couple race.

363
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:23,100
There are 12 people. Among 6 couples,

364
00:13:23,105 --> 00:13:25,300
there are five thieves...

365
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,870
and seven civilians.

366
00:13:27,877 --> 00:13:30,570
- I can already spot the thieves. - What are you saying?

367
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:34,025
The leader of the thieves, Boss, is hidden among them.

368
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,565
And the leader of the civilians, King, is hidden among them too.

369
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,450
However,

370
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,735
among the five thieves in Team Thieves,

371
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:46,260
the four thieves know who one another are.

372
00:13:46,262 --> 00:13:47,875
- What? - What? Really?

373
00:13:48,597 --> 00:13:50,800
The four thieves know who one another are,

374
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,070
but they do not know the identity of their Boss and the King.

375
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,115
(The 4 thieves know each other, but not the Boss and the King.)

376
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:58,285
The King of Team Civilians...

377
00:13:58,874 --> 00:14:00,840
knows the identities of the four thieves,

378
00:14:00,843 --> 00:14:03,755
but the King doesn't know the identity of the Boss.

379
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,780
So the King knows everyone except for one.

380
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:08,410
(The King knows who the 4 thieves are, except the Boss.)

381
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:10,825
In other words, the King knows who the four thieves are.

382
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,405
Team Civilians wins if the members eliminate the Boss.

383
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:18,005
Team Thieves wins if the members eliminate the King.

384
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:21,830
The members of the losing team get the water bomb penalty.

385
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:22,830
(The members of the losing team get the water bomb penalty.)

386
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,900
The weather will be cold when it's time for the penalty.

387
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,130
I don't know...

388
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:30,900
if it's because we have done this for so long,

389
00:14:30,906 --> 00:14:33,170
but there are members whose subtle changes are obvious.

390
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,270
Seok Jin is like an open book.

391
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:37,480
(Seok Jin is like an open book.)

392
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,540
- Why do you say that? - Give us some examples.

393
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:42,225
When the producer explains the rules,

394
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,150
Seok Jin never copies his hand gestures.

395
00:14:44,153 --> 00:14:45,450
He is holding his hand now.

396
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:46,995
I have never seen him do that before.

397
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,135
(The producer explains the rules.)

398
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,305
(Team Thieves and Team Civilians)

399
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,845
(Unnatural)

400
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,530
- Seriously. - He is too passionate.

401
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,770
- He is too passionate. - You are almost like Jong Kook.

402
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:04,870
I can't believe him.

403
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:07,510
Fine, I have a position.

404
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,055
(Fine, I have a position.)

405
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:11,610
He let himself go.

406
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:13,280
This is a disaster.

407
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,780
- This is a disaster. - Seriously.

408
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,150
- We got him. - Don't do this from the start.

409
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:18,350
- We got him. - He is making the race boring.

410
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:19,865
He should be given a new position.

411
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:23,450
Okay. Think what you want.

412
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,205
Seok Jin, you need to smile more naturally.

413
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:28,205
The smile isn't reaching your eyes.

414
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,730
- I guess he has something to hide. - Okay.

415
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:34,200
The winning couple of each round has the right...

416
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:36,300
to single out two couples to have their identities revealed.

417
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,755
Those couples will go up to the platform.

418
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:41,640
Please do your best as the couples you choose...

419
00:15:41,644 --> 00:15:44,210
should reflect the role you play.

420
00:15:44,213 --> 00:15:46,440
The first mission will determine the couples...

421
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:48,680
and who goes up the platform.

422
00:15:48,684 --> 00:15:49,995
Okay.

423
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:54,250
I will explain the rules of Steal My Charms.

424
00:15:54,256 --> 00:15:55,605
Do we need to steal something?

425
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:57,960
During the preliminary interview,

426
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,190
the female guests turned in the keywords of their charms.

427
00:16:00,196 --> 00:16:01,390
(There are 6 keywords for the charms.)

428
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:05,675
The male members will guess the woman behind the keyword.

429
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,930
The moment they choose a keyword, a couple will be formed.

430
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:10,030
Okay.

431
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,470
Please take a look at the keywords...

432
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:16,410
and pick one to determine your partner.

433
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,610
- Let's go. - This is nerve-wracking.

434
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:19,940
Who is "Dancing Queen"?

435
00:16:19,949 --> 00:16:21,150
Is it you, Gyeong Ree?

436
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,080
- Who is "Ms. Forehead"? - Who is it?

437
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:24,580
- Who is "Lovely Dialect"? - Dialect.

438
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:25,920
Isn't that Gook Ju?

439
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:27,120
- Is it? - No way.

440
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,490
Is it you?

441
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,590
("Lovely Dialect" is Eun Su.)

442
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:32,975
(It's me.)

443
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,630
- It's Eun Su. - She is a new face.

444
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,830
Jong Kook is lucky these days.

445
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,860
He looks so happy. Did you see his fist pump?

446
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,830
- They look good together. - He looks happy.

447
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,270
- They look good together. - You know,

448
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:44,900
when it's time to choose the partner,

449
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,870
- Jong Kook usually doesn't do this. - He is happy.

450
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,970
- She is someone I don't know well. - That's right.

451
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,210
- She is Jong Kook's type. - That's right.

452
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:54,225
- A natural beauty. - She is Jong Kook's type.

453
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,450
(Everyone gets paired up.)

454
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,150
(Jae Seok and Gyeong Ree, Haha and Dam Bi, Kwang Soo and So Min,)

455
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,020
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo, Jong Kook and Eun Su, Seok Jin and Gook Ju)

456
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:02,850
The couples have been decided.

457
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:06,090
- We need to find who the thieves, - We need to find them.

458
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:08,190
- the King, - The King.

459
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,460
and the Boss are.

460
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,945
I don't think Jong Kook cares about that today.

461
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,100
They look good together.

462
00:17:15,104 --> 00:17:16,800
Sit on a mat and spend some time together.

463
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:19,015
(Forget about the mission.)

464
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,640
Don't be ridiculous.

465
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:22,440
"Don't be ridiculous."

466
00:17:22,444 --> 00:17:25,095
- He didn't become annoyed. - I know.

467
00:17:25,481 --> 00:17:27,410
Please don't misunderstand. I don't become annoyed.

468
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,450
What is he saying?

469
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,550
(Please don't misunderstand. I don't become annoyed.)

470
00:17:31,553 --> 00:17:32,850
What is he saying?

471
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,920
- What is he saying? - What is wrong with him?

472
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,420
(What is he saying?)

473
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:39,675
- Are you serious? - What an eyesore!

474
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:41,430
- What is up with you? - What?

475
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,230
- What an eyesore! - He really likes her.

476
00:17:43,232 --> 00:17:45,200
- I don't want her to misunderstand. - What?

477
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,630
- Your ears are red. - It's because the weather is hot.

478
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:49,870
- I can't believe him. - I feel hot.

479
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:51,570
He must be serious about her.

480
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,185
She is Jong Kook's future girlfriend.

481
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:54,925
Future girlfriend?

482
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,155
Don't make things uncomfortable for her.

483
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,910
They look good together.

484
00:17:58,914 --> 00:18:00,080
Your mom will be happy.

485
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,150
(Jong Kook has a partner who suits him.)

486
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,610
(Let's see if he can find the thieves and love today.)

487
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:05,880
Now, you will verify your charms...

488
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:08,450
to win the right to send couples to the platform.

489
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:09,490
(Verify Your Charms)

490
00:18:09,491 --> 00:18:11,960
If you think you can be better with a certain keyword,

491
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,560
yell "I challenge you" and have a charm battle.

492
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:16,660
Let's check out the first keyword.

493
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:17,700
Shall I pick one?

494
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,270
(What's the first keyword?)

495
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,445
(The Fairy of Flexibility)

496
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:25,955
- What is it? - "The Fairy of Flexibility".

497
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,555
- Flexibility. - That's us.

498
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:32,455
(The Fairy of Flexibility, Son Dam Bi)

499
00:18:32,848 --> 00:18:35,450
Haha, I am not very confident about my flexibility.

500
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:37,580
(Even though it's my keyword...)

501
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:38,795
What?

502
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,295
Don't you think it's too late to say that now?

503
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,050
(Dam Bi confesses she isn't very confident.)

504
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:44,920
Don't you think it's too late to say that now?

505
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:46,960
"Haha, I am not very confident about my flexibility."

506
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,245
(She says she isn't very confident.)

507
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,190
- Dam Bi. - That was so sudden.

508
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,030
- Didn't you pick the keyword? - Yes, I did.

509
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,600
It's too late to back out now.

510
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:54,800
I will tell you the rules.

511
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,770
We will verify Dam Bi's flexibility...

512
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:58,440
with Rock-paper-scissors Split.

513
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,170
(Rock-paper-scissors Split)

514
00:19:00,175 --> 00:19:02,140
One person from a couple will come forward.

515
00:19:02,144 --> 00:19:04,740
After each round, the winner will take a step back,

516
00:19:04,747 --> 00:19:08,695
and the loser will slide his or her foot forward.

517
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:13,020
The one who can't go further or loses his or her balance loses.

518
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:14,350
(You lose.)

519
00:19:14,356 --> 00:19:16,190
Eun Su is stretching.

520
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:19,520
It really is Eun Su's first time on a variety show...

521
00:19:19,528 --> 00:19:20,660
because she doesn't know whether she should participate.

522
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,860
(Glancing around)

523
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:23,060
- She asked me... - She took off her shoes already.

524
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,730
if she can participate.

525
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,900
She kept asking me that.

526
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:28,185
(Embarrassed)

527
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,700
Can anyone participate?

528
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,030
- Anyone can participate. - Really?

529
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,085
(Glancing around)

530
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:35,755
(She looks around as the rules are being explained.)

531
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:40,055
She reminds me a bit of Lee Da Hee.

532
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:41,810
The others should watch out.

533
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,620
Eun Su and Da Hee are a bit different.

534
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,950
She is already taking off her shoes.

535
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,050
Go out there.

536
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,235
- Go out there. - Eun Su, come on.

537
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,260
- Her shoes... - Eun Su, come on.

538
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,620
All right.

539
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:56,160
- From the start... - She took off her shoes.

540
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:59,060
It's been eight years since Dam Bi came out on a variety show.

541
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:02,000
Eun Su visited a variety show for the first time.

542
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:04,415
Let's get the match started. Play rock-paper-scissors.

543
00:20:04,473 --> 00:20:07,140
- Dam Bae learned pilates for years. - Listen.

544
00:20:07,142 --> 00:20:09,040
- What? - Stop talking about pilates.

545
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:11,280
(She becomes annoyed.)

546
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Stop it. Also, watch how you pronounce her name.

547
00:20:13,682 --> 00:20:15,580
- What did I do? - Her name is Dam Bi.

548
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,380
You called me Dam Bae, "Cigarette", didn't you?

549
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:21,190
(She becomes annoyed again.)

550
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,790
- I made a mistake! - He did it earlier too.

551
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:25,790
- For goodness' sake. - I heard it.

552
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,375
She might avoid variety shows again because of you.

553
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,175
Make sure you open your mouth and enunciate.

554
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,700
Don't call her Dam Bae.

555
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:36,445
It was Dam Bi's nickname from her school days.

556
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,640
- Right? - "Alcohol and Cigarette"?

557
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,300
("Alcohol and Cigarette"?)

558
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,840
- "Alcohol and Cigarette"? - Was that your nickname?

559
00:20:42,845 --> 00:20:45,240
Son Dam Bi does sound like "Alcohol and Cigarette".

560
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:47,110
I got that nickname because of my name.

561
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:50,280
- She talked about it on a show. - You know,

562
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:52,450
the generation gap just became apparent.

563
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:55,590
Seok Jin heard the nickname as "Sol Cigarette".

564
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:56,950
(Seok Jin heard the nickname as "Sol Cigarette".)

565
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,420
Sol Cigarette was popular back in our days.

566
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,260
- Sol Cigarette. - Sol Cigarette was popular.

567
00:21:02,264 --> 00:21:04,030
That's right.

568
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,060
- It was popular back then. - He is an old man.

569
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,800
Let's get started.

570
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:12,400
I am really inflexible.

571
00:21:12,407 --> 00:21:15,110
It's annoying if the person who says so is flexible.

572
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,540
(It's annoying if the person who says so is flexible.)

573
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:21,310
Dam Bi changed a lot.

574
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:23,180
- What is wrong with her? - Your talk...

575
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:24,410
- improved. - She wasn't like that before.

576
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:26,965
- Her tone changed. - What happened in the eight years?

577
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:29,120
She wasn't like that before.

578
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,790
She wasn't like that in "Family Outing".

579
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:32,790
She is the feistiest woman I know.

580
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,130
(She is the feistiest woman I know.)

581
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,630
- She is the feistiest woman. - Seriously.

582
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,260
I guess it's true that she disciplined the junior singers.

583
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:40,260
(Jong Kook frames her.)

584
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,930
That's not true. I was a solo artist.

585
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,315
Get ready.

586
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:48,610
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

587
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,340
(The loser must split her legs.)

588
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:53,810
(Dam Bi wins.)

589
00:21:53,815 --> 00:21:55,450
(Dam Bi takes a step back.)

590
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,750
It's okay.

591
00:21:56,752 --> 00:21:58,020
That's it.

592
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,050
Can I switch my feet?

593
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:01,390
- No. - Really?

594
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,520
You have to stick to the foot you chose.

595
00:22:02,524 --> 00:22:03,990
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

596
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:06,435
(Dam Bi wins again.)

597
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,760
(Eun Su splits her legs further.)

598
00:22:08,764 --> 00:22:10,360
- That's good. Come on. - Okay.

599
00:22:10,365 --> 00:22:11,915
She is good at rock-paper-scissors.

600
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,100
It's okay. You can win this time.

601
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:16,385
That's good. Come on.

602
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,070
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

603
00:22:18,073 --> 00:22:21,215
(Eun Su wins.)

604
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:23,870
You just need to win this time. Okay!

605
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:26,010
(Being good at rock-paper-scissors can change the result of the game.)

606
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:27,655
Like this?

607
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,680
You just need to win rock-paper-scissors.

608
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:30,980
- You just need to win. - That's how it works.

609
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:32,050
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

610
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,995
(Eun Su wins again.)

611
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:36,165
- Okay. - That's good.

612
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,075
- It's okay. - Rock-paper-scissors

613
00:22:39,628 --> 00:22:41,205
Finish her.

614
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,160
Win one more time.

615
00:22:43,165 --> 00:22:44,330
My goodness.

616
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,000
(Dam Bi has to win the next round.)

617
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,070
- It's almost over. - This round is important.

618
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,530
Win one more round.

619
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:52,070
- Win one more round. - Rock-paper-scissors

620
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:55,440
(Dam Bi wins.)

621
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,140
- Okay. - Okay, okay.

622
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,610
Eun Su, split your legs.

623
00:22:58,614 --> 00:23:01,125
(Eun Su must split her legs as Dam Bi has.)

624
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:03,410
(Can Eun Su succeed?)

625
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:04,920
- Okay! - You did it.

626
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,120
That hurts! I have a cramp!

627
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:10,890
(The split comes with a cost.)

628
00:23:10,892 --> 00:23:12,675
- I have a cramp! - She is good.

629
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:14,360
- I have a cramp! - She really has a cramp.

630
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,330
- She really has a cramp. - She has a cramp.

631
00:23:16,331 --> 00:23:18,315
- She has a cramp. - She has a cramp.

632
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
(Eun Su has a cramp.)

633
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:22,270
- Are you okay? - You need to stretch the muscle.

634
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,515
- Are you okay? - Pull her foot back.

635
00:23:24,873 --> 00:23:26,540
(Pulling)

636
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,670
Don't do that.

637
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:29,740
- Stretch the muscle. - She has a cramp.

638
00:23:29,745 --> 00:23:31,410
- Pull her foot back. - My goodness.

639
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:32,640
She has a cramp.

640
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:33,895
Do you have a cramp?

641
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,980
- Eun Su, are you okay? - Yes.

642
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:37,880
Play rock-paper-scissors.

643
00:23:37,886 --> 00:23:39,350
This is the last round.

644
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:41,590
- Let's go. - This is the last round.

645
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,505
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

646
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,875
(Eun Su wins dramatically.)

647
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:47,390
She won.

648
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,490
(Screaming in happiness)

649
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:51,930
- She won. - What will Dam Bi do?

650
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:53,475
You can do it.

651
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:55,815
That's good. That's good.

652
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:58,255
(Stretching)

653
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,400
(She easily succeeds.)

654
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:02,610
She can go further.

655
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:04,170
She sat down. She sat down.

656
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:05,840
- She is so flexible. - She is so cool.

657
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:07,110
I am so impressed.

658
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,110
She is a hero.

659
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,650
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

660
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:13,220
(At this critical moment, Eun Su wins again.)

661
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,520
(Something is not right.)

662
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,190
She managed it.

663
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,665
Hold on.

664
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:19,875
(Moving)

665
00:24:19,928 --> 00:24:22,090
(Dam Bi moves her foot.)

666
00:24:22,097 --> 00:24:24,330
- Her foot moved. - Hold on.

667
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:27,030
- How far did it move? - It used to be here.

668
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,500
(Let go!)

669
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:31,000
It was here before.

670
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:34,215
No, it wasn't.

671
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:36,310
- It was here. - Hold on.

672
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:38,440
It wasn't there!

673
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:40,210
- Hold on. - It was there.

674
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:42,810
- What are you doing? - It was there.

675
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:45,850
- Dam Bi, calm down. - We have to obey the rules.

676
00:24:45,854 --> 00:24:48,390
- Calm down. - It wasn't there.

677
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,920
- Dam Bi has to win this time. - Then you can be the winner.

678
00:24:50,926 --> 00:24:52,120
Dam Bi has to win this time.

679
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,020
Rock-paper...

680
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,775
(Dam Bi couldn't stretch any further.)

681
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:57,445
You can do this.

682
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,030
You can be the winner.

683
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,430
(The result depends on this rock-paper-scissors.)

684
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:02,130
(Who will be the winner?)

685
00:25:02,137 --> 00:25:03,200
Scissors

686
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:05,170
(Eun Su wins.)

687
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,070
- She threw it late. - No, I didn't!

688
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:08,070
(Complaining)

689
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:09,970
- She threw it late. - She threw it late.

690
00:25:09,978 --> 00:25:11,810
I didn't!

691
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:13,710
Hey! She didn't.

692
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,650
- Calm down. - She was on time.

693
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,910
- Hold on. - Please review the video.

694
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,180
- Okay. - Please review the video.

695
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,980
- Haha, talk to her. - She is right.

696
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:22,420
- Talk to Dam Bi. - She is right.

697
00:25:22,424 --> 00:25:24,690
- This is unfair. - Dam Bi threw it high,

698
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:26,920
- and Eun Su threw it low. - No. She...

699
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:28,860
- Jong Kook. - Okay.

700
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,290
(Jong Kook)

701
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:31,730
Gosh.

702
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,530
Okay.

703
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:35,470
Okay, Dam Bi.

704
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,845
(Nice job, Dam Bi.)

705
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:39,200
Let's do it again.

706
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:41,515
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

707
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,370
(Eun Su wins.)

708
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,370
Okay.

709
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:46,325
(Dam Bi moves her foot again.)

710
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,210
- It's over. - You shouldn't move your foot.

711
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,620
It should be here.

712
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,335
Eun Su wins!

713
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,620
Good job.

714
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,120
We win. Good job.

715
00:25:58,126 --> 00:26:01,830
It was Dam Bi's specialty, but Eun Su won.

716
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,560
You have to win rock-paper-scissors at the right time.

717
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,300
- Rock-paper-scissors is important. - Go.

718
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,115
It's more important to win rock-paper-scissors.

719
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,100
(Gook Ju is pushed into participating.)

720
00:26:11,106 --> 00:26:13,340
Oh, my. I'm sorry, but...

721
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:14,810
(I'm sorry, but...)

722
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,370
I can't put my feet together. Is that okay?

723
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:18,310
- It's okay. - Because of my thighs,

724
00:26:18,313 --> 00:26:19,540
I can't put my thighs together.

725
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:21,110
(There is a gap.)

726
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:23,480
- I can't... - We will...

727
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:25,535
Hold on.

728
00:26:26,188 --> 00:26:28,450
- She loses. - Gook Ju.

729
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,350
- Gook Ju. - They can use computer graphics.

730
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:34,035
They can put your feet together with computer graphics.

731
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:36,490
It's so hot here.

732
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,090
- Good. - Are you okay?

733
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,130
Here comes another participant.

734
00:26:40,135 --> 00:26:41,600
(Here comes another participant.)

735
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:44,800
- Kwang Soo? - Yes.

736
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:46,370
- It's hot. - You can do this!

737
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:49,585
- My big feet will help. - Your long legs will help too.

738
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:53,110
- Let's start right away. - Is he wearing flippers?

739
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:55,180
No. They're my feet.

740
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:57,565
- Are they really your feet? - Yes, they are.

741
00:26:57,853 --> 00:27:00,020
It doesn't look right.

742
00:27:00,021 --> 00:27:02,820
- His feet look weird. - Are they really your feet?

743
00:27:02,824 --> 00:27:04,505
(He has 290mm feet.)

744
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,320
Your toenails are still rotten.

745
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:09,805
(Your toenails are still rotten.)

746
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:13,100
Be quiet.

747
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:14,760
Gosh.

748
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,800
(Now everyone knows Kwang Soo has rotten toenails.)

749
00:27:16,805 --> 00:27:19,540
After all these years, they're still rotten.

750
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,340
Don't say that in front of Eun Su.

751
00:27:21,343 --> 00:27:23,370
Eun Su, don't look at it. It's just a disease.

752
00:27:23,378 --> 00:27:24,810
- It's rotten. - No, it's not!

753
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:27,010
(It's just a disease.)

754
00:27:27,015 --> 00:27:29,910
It's not rotten. Don't say that in front of Eun Su.

755
00:27:29,918 --> 00:27:31,725
Who can hear it then?

756
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,295
Please don't step on my foot.

757
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:36,650
Did you hear that? Eun Su said, "Please don't step on my foot."

758
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:37,720
(She asks Kwang Soo not to step on her foot.)

759
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:39,760
She says what she wants to say.

760
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,930
It looks like a sand-covered clam.

761
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:46,215
- It looks like a clam. - It looks like a clam.

762
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:49,730
What is he doing?

763
00:27:49,738 --> 00:27:52,415
- Paint his toenail. - He's painting Kwang Soo's toenail.

764
00:27:53,975 --> 00:27:55,640
- My goodness. - What's wrong with him?

765
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,110
His feet are hairy.

766
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:59,580
Isn't it a clam?

767
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:01,225
It's a cockle.

768
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,910
Gosh, I quIt.

769
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,580
(Gosh, I quit.)

770
00:28:04,586 --> 00:28:06,180
(Kwang Soo gives up.)

771
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:09,220
- Kwang Soo, it looks okay now. - I quit.

772
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:11,720
- It looks much better now. - It does.

773
00:28:11,726 --> 00:28:13,590
It's just a disease.

774
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:15,230
That's why I painted it.

775
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,860
It looks dirtier now.

776
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,460
(It looks dirtier now.)

777
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:20,245
She says it looks dirtier now!

778
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:21,930
Dam Bi says it looks dirtier.

779
00:28:21,937 --> 00:28:24,285
What?

780
00:28:24,572 --> 00:28:25,640
Sorry.

781
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,555
(Kwang Soo gives up.)

782
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:30,725
Next, Ji Hyo!

783
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:32,910
- Win four times in a row. - Rock-paper-scissors

784
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:34,510
- She's good at rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors

785
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:36,650
- Rock-paper-scissors - Yes!

786
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:38,720
- Ji Hyo wins. - Ji Hyo wins!

787
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,395
Yes! Ji Hyo!

788
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:43,705
It's Gyeong Ree's turn now.

789
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:45,460
- You're good at this. - Ji Hyo.

790
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,630
Gyeong Ree, you saw it, right? Play rock-paper-scissors.

791
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,760
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

792
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:50,830
(Ji Hyo wins.)

793
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,630
That's no problem.

794
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,000
It's meaningless.

795
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:57,730
You haven't been watching? Move the foot in the front.

796
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,400
"You haven't been watching?"

797
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:02,010
- He's scary. - Just tell her what to do.

798
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,740
Why did you say, "You haven't been watching?"

799
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:06,080
- We've played four rounds so far. - Gosh.

800
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:09,110
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

801
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:12,480
- Hold on. - She touched the ground.

802
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:14,020
(She almost falls.)

803
00:29:14,022 --> 00:29:15,820
- She's out! - She didn't fall though.

804
00:29:15,824 --> 00:29:18,390
Gyeong Ree, what happened to you?

805
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:21,320
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - You used to be flexible.

806
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:23,290
(Wobbling)

807
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,230
Are you walking a tightrope?

808
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,630
- Did you drink last night? - What's wrong?

809
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,700
- I didn't get enough sleep. - You didn't?

810
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,185
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

811
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,800
- What is this? - What is this?

812
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:35,610
Does she have BPPV?

813
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,755
(Does she have BPPV?)

814
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,080
- It makes you unstable. - Be quiet.

815
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:42,110
What are you talking about?

816
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,550
- I'm sorry. - I think she has it.

817
00:29:44,552 --> 00:29:46,520
(Gyeong Ree keeps wobbling.)

818
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:49,490
- Are you walking a tightrope? - Stay still.

819
00:29:49,491 --> 00:29:52,360
- What's wrong? - What are you doing?

820
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,560
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

821
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,730
(Gyeong Ree wins rock-paper-scissors.)

822
00:29:56,731 --> 00:30:00,360
- Yes! - It's over now.

823
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:03,845
Ji Hyo's legs are not long enough.

824
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,340
You won't reach even if you lie down.

825
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,740
Ji Hyo does look short today.

826
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,070
- I can do it! - Be quiet. She can do it.

827
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,710
I can do it!

828
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:14,810
You'll have to dislocate your legs to reach here.

829
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:17,210
What are you talking about?

830
00:30:17,218 --> 00:30:19,180
Don't say that.

831
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:22,390
It's scientifically impossible.

832
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,450
You'll have to pull your legs out.

833
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:26,590
- What if she can't walk? - Come on.

834
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,130
- I can do it. - She's doing it.

835
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,290
- Come on. - Your left foot.

836
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:34,045
- She has to dislocate her legs. - It's too far.

837
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:35,530
You can start now.

838
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:40,340
(If Ji Hyo pulls it off, she'll win.)

839
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,125
It's not going to work.

840
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:45,110
(Ji Hyo fails.)

841
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,210
Gyeong Ree wins!

842
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:49,450
- This is so disappointing. - This is so disappointing.

843
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,450
(I wish I was taller.)

844
00:30:50,452 --> 00:30:51,795
If you had won only one more time...

845
00:30:53,188 --> 00:30:56,065
I didn't do much, but I won.

846
00:30:56,157 --> 00:30:58,660
- Kwang Soo, pick one. - Okay.

847
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,820
Pick a good one.

848
00:30:59,828 --> 00:31:01,505
(What will be the next game?)

849
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,030
"Dancing Queen".

850
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,245
(Dancing Queen)

851
00:31:04,466 --> 00:31:05,660
- Is it ours? - Whose is it?

852
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,530
It's Gyeong Ree's.

853
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:09,915
("Dancing Queen" is Gyeong Ree's keyword.)

854
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,700
Gook Ju will be good at it.

855
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,440
We have many dancing queens today.

856
00:31:14,442 --> 00:31:17,640
There will be a random dance battle.

857
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,440
(Random Dance Battle)

858
00:31:19,447 --> 00:31:22,980
When music plays, anyone can step forward and dance.

859
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,950
The couple who receives the most enthusiastic reaction wins.

860
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:27,520
When music plays, Gyeong Ree will start.

861
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:29,490
Okay. Gyeong Ree will start.

862
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:31,220
- Music. - Come on!

863
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:32,590
- Go. - Come on!

864
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,135
Let's go.

865
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:35,930
It's "Havana".

866
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,560
(It's the sexy song, "Havana".)

867
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:39,115
"Havana".

868
00:31:39,434 --> 00:31:40,930
(She fixes her hair...)

869
00:31:40,935 --> 00:31:43,730
(and steps forward relaxedly.)

870
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,570
(She uses her towel.)

871
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,955
- She's using her towel. - She's so sexy.

872
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,910
- She's good. - She's starting.

873
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:54,580
(Her hip dance overwhelms everyone.)

874
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:57,210
- She's so good. - She's an amazing dancer.

875
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:59,695
- Her shoulders move on their own. - That will do.

876
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:01,935
Look at that.

877
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,420
(She suddenly lies down on the grass.)

878
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:06,275
- What is she doing? - What is she doing?

879
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:08,930
Hey.

880
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,830
- What is she doing? - You can lie down?

881
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:14,100
- You can lie down too. - That's so amazing.

882
00:32:14,102 --> 00:32:17,545
- That's amazing. - Your microphone.

883
00:32:17,972 --> 00:32:19,000
Your microphone.

884
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:20,415
(She picks it up.)

885
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:23,310
(She uses her microphone too.)

886
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:25,310
- She picked up her microphone. - She uses everything.

887
00:32:25,313 --> 00:32:27,195
- She's using her microphone. - She's using everyhting.

888
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:29,550
- She can use everything. - Did you see that?

889
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:30,710
She can use everything.

890
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:34,080
That was Gyeong Ree. Does anyone want to try? Come on.

891
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,150
Is it the same song?

892
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:37,120
(The original dancing queen, Dam Bi, participates.)

893
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,460
- There's a chair! - Can you use a chair?

894
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,030
- There's a chair? - Amazing.

895
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,230
(She raises her leg.)

896
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:45,330
Beautiful.

897
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:47,600
- She looks so sexy. - Let's go!

898
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,500
(The original dancing queen starts out intense.)

899
00:32:49,504 --> 00:32:52,000
- Good! - We haven't seen this in a while.

900
00:32:52,006 --> 00:32:53,785
- She looks so sexy. - Good!

901
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,570
Good.

902
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:56,570
(After dancing relaxedly for a moment,)

903
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:59,525
(she conquers the stage with a split.)

904
00:33:00,348 --> 00:33:01,955
She should have done it earlier.

905
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:06,080
- That's my move. - I lose.

906
00:33:06,087 --> 00:33:07,080
(A bit of air cycling)

907
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,665
That's my move.

908
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:12,820
(She finishes with a kiss.)

909
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,120
- That was amazing. - Thank you.

910
00:33:15,129 --> 00:33:17,730
- That was fantastic. - Who else wants to try?

911
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:20,330
Eun Su?

912
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,945
(Spinning)

913
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:24,200
(She warms up with cute moves.)

914
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:27,915
- That's so cute. - She's cute.

915
00:33:28,109 --> 00:33:30,210
I like it.

916
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,340
Jong Kook, you should join.

917
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:34,710
That's so cute.

918
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,310
(Eun Su's one gesture makes Jong Kook join.)

919
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:39,750
What should I do?

920
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:42,190
Why are you so sweaty?

921
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,450
That's so cute.

922
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:44,450
(The audience is enthusiastic.)

923
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:47,290
Look at that.

924
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:50,075
(I want to dance with Eun Su too.)

925
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:52,500
Stop it!

926
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,830
(What?)

927
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,270
Oh, my gosh!

928
00:33:56,271 --> 00:34:00,685
(So Min goes through Kwang Soo's legs to stop him.)

929
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,425
(You can't go anywhere.)

930
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,380
(Couple dance)

931
00:34:08,383 --> 00:34:10,250
We were dancing. What are you doing?

932
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:12,535
- What was that? - What's wrong?

933
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:13,780
What is she doing?

934
00:34:13,788 --> 00:34:15,550
Kwang Soo wasn't standing there for you.

935
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,990
It was for Eun Su.

936
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,190
Did you pass under me?

937
00:34:18,192 --> 00:34:20,060
- Why did you? - What's wrong with you?

938
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,160
How could you?

939
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:22,830
- Kwang Soo. - Why did you do that?

940
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,730
I thought a dog passed by.

941
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:27,260
Kwang Soo came out for Eun Su.

942
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:28,360
- By the way... - You startled me.

943
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,770
- You're so rude. - Eun Su.

944
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,100
(Jong Kook and Eun Su's dance stops.)

945
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,600
Let's dance to Korean pop songs.

946
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:33,800
- Okay. - It'll be exciting.

947
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:35,415
- Exciting Korean pop music. - That sounds good.

948
00:34:36,744 --> 00:34:38,125
Korean pop songs?

949
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:40,855
(Brave sounds play.)

950
00:34:41,115 --> 00:34:43,425
- This is amazing. - Goodness.

951
00:34:44,052 --> 00:34:49,790
("Crazy", a hit song by Son Dam Bi in 2008)

952
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:54,305
(A sexy dance with a chair was key.)

953
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:57,705
Dance however you want even if you don't know the dance.

954
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,060
(She sits on the chair.)

955
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,560
- That's good. - Let's go.

956
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:02,470
That's good. It's the same so far.

957
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,770
- It's a perfect song for So Min. - She knows the hand movement.

958
00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:07,870
- It's her song. - You're really crazy.

959
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,525
(So Min is really crazy.)

960
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,380
(She moves lightly.)

961
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,680
She's really crazy.

962
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:14,780
(She reenacts the dance perfectly.)

963
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,425
- Does she know? - She knows the dance.

964
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:22,220
(We thought that she knew.)

965
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:26,005
(But she's just crazy.)

966
00:35:26,494 --> 00:35:27,690
She lifted her leg.

967
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:28,860
Let's go.

968
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,205
It was harder than this.

969
00:35:30,732 --> 00:35:32,775
- Is that the dance? - No.

970
00:35:33,568 --> 00:35:35,015
One more time.

971
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,200
(She turns around.)

972
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:38,270
Why are you looking at me?

973
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:40,740
(You should look at the camera instead.)

974
00:35:40,742 --> 00:35:43,570
You should look at the camera.

975
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:44,785
(We're still filming.)

976
00:35:45,113 --> 00:35:47,240
(It's a crazy dance where she abandons the camera.)

977
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:48,440
That's enough.

978
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,480
Gosh, she danced while looking at me.

979
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:52,195
So Min turned...

980
00:35:52,286 --> 00:35:53,965
- That's funny. - to the wrong direction.

981
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:55,720
(How was my dance?)

982
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,720
Next up is...

983
00:35:56,724 --> 00:35:58,735
- Ji Hyo. - Let's see.

984
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:00,460
Let's win some points.

985
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:02,790
I want to win points.

986
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:04,890
- Get ready. - You didn't warn me at all.

987
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,175
Just do it.

988
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:07,960
Are you starting with your leg on?

989
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,400
Start with your leg on. That's right.

990
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:13,100
That's good. That's right, Ji Hyo.

991
00:36:13,107 --> 00:36:14,640
Shake your legs, Ji Hyo.

992
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:15,970
- 1, 2, 1, 2. - She put on her legs.

993
00:36:15,977 --> 00:36:18,110
- That's good. - You're cute.

994
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:19,695
Even girls like her.

995
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:20,810
You're doing well.

996
00:36:20,815 --> 00:36:22,310
Is that how it goes?

997
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:23,625
It doesn't matter.

998
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:24,880
That's good.

999
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:27,695
(Her charms attract women.)

1000
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:28,850
That's good.

1001
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:32,005
(While being charming, she throws down the chair.)

1002
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:33,990
(She acts like a gangster.)

1003
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,205
Look at that.

1004
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:38,130
She's like an old real estate agent.

1005
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:39,360
She's what people want now.

1006
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:40,560
That was great.

1007
00:36:40,568 --> 00:36:42,115
- She was charming to women. - You did it.

1008
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,430
- That looked real. - You did well.

1009
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:44,500
That was pretty.

1010
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:45,940
It's the perfect pose for today's world.

1011
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,840
- It was unique. - However,

1012
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,210
I expect the score on her dance to be quite low.

1013
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:52,940
(However, I expect the score on her dance to be quite low.)

1014
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:54,625
- She didn't consider the score. - Why?

1015
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,210
- She didn't consider the score. - Why?

1016
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:58,250
- What about her legs? - Her attitude was good,

1017
00:36:58,252 --> 00:36:59,520
but the dance score is...

1018
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,020
- She didn't dance much. - She didn't dance much?

1019
00:37:01,022 --> 00:37:02,220
Yes. She didn't dance much.

1020
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,020
Who's next?

1021
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:05,960
(Dancing Machine Gook Ju is next.)

1022
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,320
- That's amazing. - Someone else goes.

1023
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,805
- She's amazing. - Gook Ju is good at it.

1024
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:12,830
Can you swing your leg around?

1025
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,000
(Can you swing your leg above the chair?)

1026
00:37:14,001 --> 00:37:15,515
Can you swing your leg over it?

1027
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:16,785
Shall I help you?

1028
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,200
Leave her alone.

1029
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,485
You're great.

1030
00:37:21,709 --> 00:37:25,780
(She reenacts the dance perfectly.)

1031
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,010
She's good.

1032
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:28,210
(She has to swing her leg around.)

1033
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:30,580
(What's going on?)

1034
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:35,465
(She's about to fall off the chair.)

1035
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,490
Gook Ju.

1036
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:38,965
(She hits him.)

1037
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:42,035
(She hits him in the face.)

1038
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,605
(Gosh, I'm so sorry.)

1039
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,100
The chair sank.

1040
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,375
(What's more serious is the sinking chair.)

1041
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,230
(The chair sinks to the ground.)

1042
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:51,200
- I'm sorry. - What happened?

1043
00:37:51,205 --> 00:37:53,055
Pull it out.

1044
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:56,125
(They struggle to pull it out.)

1045
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:57,925
This is unbelievable.

1046
00:37:58,379 --> 00:37:59,380
(She leaves the scene.)

1047
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,395
- It wasn't me. - This is unbelievable.

1048
00:38:01,716 --> 00:38:03,110
(The chair finally comes out.)

1049
00:38:03,117 --> 00:38:04,480
My goodness.

1050
00:38:04,485 --> 00:38:06,050
- Did the chair bend? - What?

1051
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:07,220
Come on.

1052
00:38:07,221 --> 00:38:08,650
(The legs got bent.)

1053
00:38:08,656 --> 00:38:10,450
- The chair got bent. - Stop joking.

1054
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:11,650
Did it bend?

1055
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,220
It got bent.

1056
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:14,760
- Hey. - The chair went right in.

1057
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:17,245
We might find petroleum here.

1058
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,930
- What? - Did she bore a hole?

1059
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:21,330
- It really got bent. - That was good.

1060
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:23,130
(She's embarrassed.)

1061
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:24,270
Gook Ju.

1062
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:25,430
- Gook Ju. - Yes?

1063
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,800
- That was great. - What? I'm not done yet.

1064
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,640
I love situations like this.

1065
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:31,010
I still want to dance.

1066
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:32,740
It's over. Everyone laughed.

1067
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:34,440
Gosh, what happened?

1068
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:35,610
That was amazing.

1069
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:36,980
It's been a long time.

1070
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,725
Next is Dam Bi.

1071
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:40,880
I've only seen it on TV.

1072
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:42,120
- This is real. - It's real.

1073
00:38:42,123 --> 00:38:43,535
It's been eight years.

1074
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,620
I want to watch her from here.

1075
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:46,935
That's great.

1076
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:48,790
- That's amazing. - I want to watch her.

1077
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:51,060
Her legs look sexy.

1078
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:54,300
(The song starts to play.)

1079
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:57,400
(She doesn't move at all.)

1080
00:38:57,405 --> 00:39:00,140
- You're supposed to hold here. - You aren't supposed to move.

1081
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:01,140
You shouldn't move yet.

1082
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:02,985
It isn't time to be silly.

1083
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:04,840
This was it.

1084
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,325
Her shoulders are still.

1085
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,810
You weren't supposed to dance.

1086
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,210
(She holds completely still in the beginning.)

1087
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:12,325
So Min danced silly from here.

1088
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:14,750
I've wanted to see you in real life.

1089
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:17,035
(The real is finally here.)

1090
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:19,660
(She waits for the right timing.)

1091
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,775
(She moves at the right beat.)

1092
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:26,175
(She's as beautiful as she was 10 years ago.)

1093
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,445
(She swings her leg easily.)

1094
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,700
(The real dancer is here.)

1095
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:32,870
This is it.

1096
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,055
(That's exactly it.)

1097
00:39:36,077 --> 00:39:38,010
(The original dancing queen finishes warming up.)

1098
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:40,380
- She's different. - She really is.

1099
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:41,955
The original is different.

1100
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,950
- Her dancing is different. - That's real.

1101
00:39:44,952 --> 00:39:46,050
(She moves her head.)

1102
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:49,190
(This is the real dance to "Crazy".)

1103
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:51,205
- It's different. - That's right.

1104
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,575
- Right, this is it. - It's different.

1105
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:55,760
- More, more. - It's different.

1106
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,160
It's really different.

1107
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:00,230
(Here comes the famous dog legs dance.)

1108
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,370
Here it is.

1109
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,985
(She moves her legs like dog legs.)

1110
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:07,770
(The original dancing queen)

1111
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:12,880
(She dances perfectly to the song "Crazy".)

1112
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,940
Goodness.

1113
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,040
That was the best.

1114
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:17,465
- It was perfect. - That was amazing.

1115
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,420
- That was great. - In the beginning,

1116
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,950
she doesn't get annoying.

1117
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:23,150
- I think... - You have to control yourself.

1118
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:24,605
Here's what I think.

1119
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:26,390
- You have to control yourself. - Give it to Dam Bi.

1120
00:40:26,394 --> 00:40:27,590
Give it to me.

1121
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,860
- It's obvious. - Just accept it.

1122
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:30,290
- I agree. - That's right.

1123
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,490
- Everyone. - I agree.

1124
00:40:31,499 --> 00:40:33,400
She has unanimous votes.

1125
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,945
The winner is Son Dam Bi.

1126
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:36,715
I completely agree.

1127
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,000
I forgot that she could dance.

1128
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:40,670
- I knew she was good. - Now...

1129
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:42,940
the final winning couple is...

1130
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:45,410
Haha and Dam Bi. They win three points.

1131
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:48,080
(Haha and Dam Bi are the final winners.)

1132
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:49,395
All right.

1133
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:52,065
Please bring the platform.

1134
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:53,780
Is there a platform?

1135
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,620
- We need to put up a platform. - Already?

1136
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,420
- They said it'll be on immediately. - Already?

1137
00:40:57,425 --> 00:41:00,375
The winning couple may place two couples on the platform.

1138
00:41:01,062 --> 00:41:03,690
We'll tell you if any of the four is King or Boss...

1139
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:06,115
as well as the number of thieves.

1140
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,815
Okay.

1141
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,300
- I see. - We should choose wisely.

1142
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,430
They should pick carefully.

1143
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:13,000
Pick two couples...

1144
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:15,885
to be placed on the platform after discussing.

1145
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,925
Is there King on that side?

1146
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,625
Do you think one of them is King?

1147
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:22,980
- It could be one of us. - Right.

1148
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,150
We should find out about others.

1149
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:28,620
Raise your hand if you've ever stolen anything as a child.

1150
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,465
Anyone can lie.

1151
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:33,620
Has anyone stolen a cherry at a fruit market?

1152
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:34,990
You must select that couple.

1153
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:36,760
(He whispers to them.)

1154
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:38,030
Okay.

1155
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:40,530
- What are you doing? - Why are you cornering us?

1156
00:41:40,534 --> 00:41:41,930
- Why are you cornering us? - What's wrong with you?

1157
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,000
- He's being suspicious. - The one who's cornering is.

1158
00:41:44,004 --> 00:41:46,270
- He's being suspicious. - I agree.

1159
00:41:46,273 --> 00:41:48,070
I was suspicious of Seok Jin.

1160
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,485
- He could be. - I'm not.

1161
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,610
Shouldn't we put him on first?

1162
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,310
Why would you do that?

1163
00:41:53,314 --> 00:41:55,325
He seems to be hiding something.

1164
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,550
- I'm curious. - I'm not.

1165
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,450
- I'm curious. - I really am not.

1166
00:41:58,452 --> 00:41:59,965
- We made a decision. - We made a decision.

1167
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,320
Which couples did you choose?

1168
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:05,305
(Which is the first couple Haha and Dam Bi chose?)

1169
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:08,790
- Jong Kook's team. - You choose us?

1170
00:42:08,796 --> 00:42:10,960
- Yes. Jong Kook's team. - You choose us?

1171
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,900
- Did you choose us? - Yes, and Jae Seok's team.

1172
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,000
Good job.

1173
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:15,600
Haha.

1174
00:42:15,603 --> 00:42:16,930
- Dam Bi. - We'll find something.

1175
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:18,730
- We'll find something. - You aren't what I expected.

1176
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:21,515
- Stop being silly. - Stop it.

1177
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,255
- I hope we find something. - Haha.

1178
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:26,695
Between two couples...

1179
00:42:27,782 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm curious too.

1180
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,565
Is there King or Boss?

1181
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,620
(Is one of them King or Boss?)

1182
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:34,750
Did we find both?

1183
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:37,390
(Is any one of them King or Boss?)

1184
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:38,920
- None of them are. - That's right.

1185
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:40,820
(None of them are.)

1186
00:42:40,828 --> 00:42:42,760
- I told you. - That's good.

1187
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,630
- None of us are. - None of them?

1188
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:46,400
- Seriously? - We did a good job.

1189
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,615
And...

1190
00:42:48,702 --> 00:42:51,330
- How about thieves? - the number of thieves is...

1191
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:54,540
(How about the number of thieves?)

1192
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:56,140
- It's zero. - See?

1193
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:58,340
(It's 0.)

1194
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,110
- We're civilians. - You chose well.

1195
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,810
- Did you suspect us? - All of us are civilians.

1196
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:03,080
You selected well.

1197
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,480
(We're all civilians.)

1198
00:43:04,485 --> 00:43:06,680
- They're all here. - That's right.

1199
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:08,250
There are six thieves.

1200
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,690
(It's full of thieves.)

1201
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:12,620
We're King, Boss, and thieves except for two people.

1202
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:15,360
- No. - It's you.

1203
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:17,530
- It's all of you. - It's not me.

1204
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:19,060
Civilians should team up.

1205
00:43:19,066 --> 00:43:20,930
- I'm a civilian. - You're terrible.

1206
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:22,160
I'm a civilian.

1207
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:24,470
- You picked the right couples. - This is incredible.

1208
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,040
- Okay. - This is incredible.

1209
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,815
- Now... - They're all civilians.

1210
00:43:27,975 --> 00:43:29,210
He's starting again.

1211
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,585
My goodness.

1212
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,510
- Jae Seok. - It's you, right?

1213
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,680
- Okay, we must catch two. - He's definitely one.

1214
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:36,925
It's not me. Take a look.

1215
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,480
- Just take a look. - I think you're a thief too.

1216
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:41,150
- Me? I'm not. - So Min.

1217
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:42,920
So Min doesn't say these things.

1218
00:43:42,923 --> 00:43:45,320
- That's not true. - Why are you shy today?

1219
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:48,590
- I'm not. I'm not a thief. - You weren't like this before.

1220
00:43:48,596 --> 00:43:49,830
- That's good. - You weren't.

1221
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,090
- Now... - Okay.

1222
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:53,730
let's move to the next destination after changing the team outfit.

1223
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:54,760
Come on.

1224
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,200
(They move to Buyeo.)

1225
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:58,170
How did we choose only the civilians?

1226
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:00,415
- There's one left. - Here's what this is.

1227
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:02,070
There are seven civilians.

1228
00:44:02,076 --> 00:44:04,370
- One of them is King. - Among seven civilians?

1229
00:44:04,378 --> 00:44:05,770
Yes, among seven civilians.

1230
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:09,140
Among 5 thieves, there's 1 Boss.

1231
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,380
- Among five thieves? - Yes.

1232
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:13,180
But if the King is caught,

1233
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:15,655
Team Civilians will lose.

1234
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,820
(The members of Team Thieves are unknown,)

1235
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:19,890
(and Team Civilians is Jong Kook, Eun Su, Jae Seok, and Gyeong Ree.)

1236
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:21,590
If you think about it...

1237
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,460
- Tell us what you are. - I'm a civilian.

1238
00:44:23,464 --> 00:44:24,760
- I'm a civilian. - You're thief, right?

1239
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:26,030
I'm a civilian.

1240
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:29,370
Let me be a brigand instead. Seriously.

1241
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,030
- To be honest, - I think you're a thief.

1242
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,700
I didn't know about my role before I came here,

1243
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,000
- and I was disappointed. - Why?

1244
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,070
I thought I could be a good thief.

1245
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:39,280
Usually, one of the guests is given a special role.

1246
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,640
Yes. But I didn't get any.

1247
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:43,185
Anyway, that's not important.

1248
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:45,250
- Thieves. - Jae Seok.

1249
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:46,320
What are you talking about?

1250
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,750
I'm telling you the ones that look like thieves.

1251
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:52,420
- Who are they? - Dam Bi is definitely a thief.

1252
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,890
Haha has been acting weird too.

1253
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,590
Haha is definitely a thief.

1254
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:58,430
I agree.

1255
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,060
I even suspect that...

1256
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,275
he is Boss.

1257
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:06,015
One thing is bothering me.

1258
00:45:06,106 --> 00:45:08,475
Our first choice was so smart.

1259
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:11,840
But it gave Jae Seok...

1260
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,280
a special role.

1261
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,480
- He suddenly became a detective. - Right.

1262
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:18,480
- He's a detective now. - He's so excited.

1263
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,350
It was such a smart choice.

1264
00:45:20,354 --> 00:45:21,650
He was just a civilian at first.

1265
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:23,690
We should have chosen Seok Jin.

1266
00:45:23,691 --> 00:45:25,690
- But... - Then...

1267
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,060
We shouldn't do that.

1268
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:28,920
He'd be too embarrassed.

1269
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,530
- This has happened many times. - Seok Jin...

1270
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,130
- I felt to sorry for him. - He definitely has a special role.

1271
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:34,460
- So... - I'm sure he does.

1272
00:45:34,468 --> 00:45:37,905
He has a special role, and it shows.

1273
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:39,845
I feel bad.

1274
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,340
I was guessing...

1275
00:45:41,342 --> 00:45:44,540
it might be Seok Jin's team versus So Min's team.

1276
00:45:44,545 --> 00:45:46,740
There's something going on between them these days.

1277
00:45:46,747 --> 00:45:51,610
When So Min has a special role,

1278
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:53,150
she becomes quiet.

1279
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:55,120
- She doesn't talk? - She doesn't want to get caught.

1280
00:45:55,122 --> 00:45:56,650
She's been like that today.

1281
00:45:56,657 --> 00:45:58,720
But if it's So Min and Seok Jin,

1282
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:00,320
won't they get caught too early?

1283
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,720
- Right. - They'll get caught right away.

1284
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:02,930
- But it's confusing. - It is.

1285
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,860
We don't know who is which.

1286
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,175
That's hard.

1287
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:09,530
Anyway, Detective Kim and Detective Yu must be...

1288
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:11,670
grilling the two.

1289
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:13,670
- The two? - They must be grilling them.

1290
00:46:13,674 --> 00:46:15,470
I'm so glad I'm not on the same team as them.

1291
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:16,885
- Right. - Seriously.

1292
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,910
- It's under the seat. - It goes over your waist.

1293
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,315
It goes over your waist.

1294
00:46:21,515 --> 00:46:22,640
(Jong Kook helps Eun Su with her seat belt.)

1295
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,780
- Thank you. - He's so sweet.

1296
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,250
- He's so sweet. - You're so sweet.

1297
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:27,595
Oh, my.

1298
00:46:29,189 --> 00:46:30,490
You're smiling so big.

1299
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:31,825
- You're smiling. - I'm happy.

1300
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,360
- Kwang Soo is smiling. - I like watching these things.

1301
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:36,890
- I like it too. - Watching what?

1302
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,530
I like watching lovey-dovey people.

1303
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:41,830
What are you talking about? I'm too old for her.

1304
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:45,045
Jong Kook, age is not important.

1305
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:46,845
I love this.

1306
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,670
Eun Su, if you keep doing that, it'll make us uncomfortable.

1307
00:46:49,676 --> 00:46:50,940
- It'll make us uncomfortable. - Right.

1308
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:52,710
It'll make Eun Su uncomfortable.

1309
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:54,255
How old are you?

1310
00:46:54,448 --> 00:46:56,185
- I'm very old. - Are you...

1311
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,855
- 38? - I'm older than that.

1312
00:46:58,986 --> 00:47:01,080
- Are you over 40? - I'm over 40.

1313
00:47:01,088 --> 00:47:02,380
You're pretty old.

1314
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,765
(I'll pretend I'm not listening.)

1315
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:05,890
You're older than I thought.

1316
00:47:05,893 --> 00:47:07,835
I'm sorry, but we'll take a taxi instead.

1317
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:10,930
I can't say anything.

1318
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,930
Be quiet. Let's just listen. I'm curious.

1319
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,100
I love listening to these things.

1320
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:16,530
Do you have any siblings?

1321
00:47:16,537 --> 00:47:18,000
- I have an older sister. - How old is she?

1322
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,545
She's married.

1323
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,000
When did you debut?

1324
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:23,670
Two years ago.

1325
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,710
You should be careful with guys.

1326
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,680
- Even when you're young. - You're right.

1327
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:30,710
You shouldn't meet bad guys for the sake of experience.

1328
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,925
When you meet someone you really like,

1329
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:37,090
it might make you regret.

1330
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:39,720
If you work out and don't smoke or drink,

1331
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:42,295
you age more slowly than others.

1332
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:43,790
(Glaring, shy)

1333
00:47:43,797 --> 00:47:44,890
We're just talking.

1334
00:47:44,898 --> 00:47:45,960
- The thing is... - I mean it.

1335
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,875
I'm curious.

1336
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:49,360
You two are...

1337
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,900
- civilians, right? - Yes.

1338
00:47:50,904 --> 00:47:52,400
Then you should be questioning us.

1339
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:55,500
(You should be questioning us.)

1340
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:57,440
"What's your role?"

1341
00:47:57,444 --> 00:47:59,640
- The thing is... - "Are you a thief? Are you Boss?"

1342
00:47:59,646 --> 00:48:02,580
- It's just that... - That's your usual style.

1343
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,650
- He's usually very harsh. - It's not like that.

1344
00:48:04,651 --> 00:48:05,750
- Right now... - Look.

1345
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:08,520
- They don't care about the mission. - Listen to me.

1346
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:12,120
Look. We need something...

1347
00:48:12,126 --> 00:48:15,965
We need hints to pressure you with.

1348
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:18,360
- But we have nothing. - When I got in this car,

1349
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,560
I thought Jong Kook would hit me.

1350
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:22,330
What are you talking about?

1351
00:48:22,336 --> 00:48:25,000
I thought, if I didn't tell him I'm Boss, he'd hit him.

1352
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:28,145
I haven't heard Jong Kook's voice this soft in a while.

1353
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:30,070
- Is he being soft? - Very.

1354
00:48:30,077 --> 00:48:31,510
Then usually...

1355
00:48:31,512 --> 00:48:33,615
You're smiling a lot today.

1356
00:48:33,647 --> 00:48:34,680
Jong Kook is smiling a lot.

1357
00:48:34,681 --> 00:48:38,110
I'm smiling because you guys are making this up.

1358
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,620
I smiled when you did this with Jin Young too.

1359
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:44,665
Can you two talk for 10 minutes pretending we're not here?

1360
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:46,390
I'm so happy.

1361
00:48:46,393 --> 00:48:48,320
Whether I win or lose, I'm so happy today.

1362
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,565
(They're entering Buyeo.)

1363
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:53,360
(Buyeo was the capital of Baekje 1,500 years ago.)

1364
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,770
(The five-storied stone pagoda and Jeongnimsa Temple Site)

1365
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,970
Oh, it's beautiful.

1366
00:48:58,972 --> 00:49:01,070
(They arrive at Gungnamji, the palace pond of Baekje.)

1367
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:02,615
What's that?

1368
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:06,315
That's a lotus, right?

1369
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:07,710
I see something.

1370
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:09,910
That's what we used when Gook Ju appeared last time.

1371
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:11,150
Isn't it the one that you push each other out?

1372
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:13,150
(2 years ago, they had to push each other out of this bowl.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1373
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:14,380
We have to push each other out.

1374
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,695
Then we should try to be partners with Jong Kook.

1375
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:20,060
To decide who gets to eat and send people onto the platform,

1376
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,265
let's start Lotus Flower War.

1377
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:25,035
You'll be divided into three teams...

1378
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,660
and dance in the flower. When the whistle blows,

1379
00:49:27,668 --> 00:49:29,970
you have to push the other teams out.

1380
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,275
Only the winning teams...

1381
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,040
will get to eat a lotus leaf rice meal.

1382
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,570
- A lotus leaf rice meal? - Only the winning teams?

1383
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:37,310
Only the winning teams?

1384
00:49:37,311 --> 00:49:41,240
(Only the winning teams get to eat and send people onto the platform.)

1385
00:49:41,248 --> 00:49:42,610
(Group 1)

1386
00:49:42,616 --> 00:49:44,455
(Group 2)

1387
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,125
I won't care who it is.

1388
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,290
It's "Bboom Bboom".

1389
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,450
(Let's warm up.)

1390
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,495
(Shall we warm up with "Bboom Bboom"?)

1391
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:01,330
(They forget about the war for a moment and have fun.)

1392
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,200
- Let's relieve our stress! - Bboom bboom!

1393
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:05,375
(Whistle)

1394
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:07,475
Has it started?

1395
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,870
- Se Chan. - Jong Kook.

1396
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,440
You haven't felt it for real, have you?

1397
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,115
What do you mean?

1398
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:14,910
You can't hit me.

1399
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:16,725
I'm not hitting you.

1400
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,755
- I'm just grabbing you. - You can't hit me.

1401
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,750
Here we go.

1402
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:23,190
- Okay. - Grab his leg.

1403
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,090
- Okay. - There you go.

1404
00:50:25,092 --> 00:50:27,620
You can't lift me anyway.

1405
00:50:27,628 --> 00:50:29,490
Grab his leg!

1406
00:50:29,496 --> 00:50:31,705
You can't lift me.

1407
00:50:31,732 --> 00:50:33,100
It won't work.

1408
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,860
(Ji Hyo and So Min attack Jong Kook's partner, Eun Su.)

1409
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,500
Seriously.

1410
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:38,705
Push Eun Su out first.

1411
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:41,900
(I should rescue Eun Su.)

1412
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:43,040
Eun Su!

1413
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:45,315
Grab his leg!

1414
00:50:46,847 --> 00:50:48,380
You can't lift me.

1415
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:49,885
(What?)

1416
00:50:50,484 --> 00:50:53,520
(Eun Su won't budge.)

1417
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,680
(She resists the two girl's attack.)

1418
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:55,895
Gosh.

1419
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,065
She's so strong.

1420
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,065
Look at Eun Su.

1421
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:03,030
(Eun Su is surprisingly strong.)

1422
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,360
Eun Su is so strong. Look at her.

1423
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:07,630
Let's just play rock-paper-scissors.

1424
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:08,930
Eun Su lifted So Min.

1425
00:51:08,935 --> 00:51:10,175
(Screaming)

1426
00:51:10,671 --> 00:51:12,630
(So Min is put down on the ground.)

1427
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,770
(Eun Su, please spare my life.)

1428
00:51:14,775 --> 00:51:16,040
Is it over?

1429
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:18,145
- She lifted her. - She's being pushed out.

1430
00:51:19,313 --> 00:51:20,915
Look at that.

1431
00:51:22,082 --> 00:51:23,950
(Eun Su even succeeds in overpowering Kwang Soo.)

1432
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:27,125
Ji Hyo, grab here!

1433
00:51:27,988 --> 00:51:31,550
(Jong Kook pushes Se Chan out.)

1434
00:51:31,558 --> 00:51:33,565
It's over.

1435
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:35,290
Gosh.

1436
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,960
Look at that.

1437
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,060
(Jong Kook lifts Ji Hyo...)

1438
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:39,190
(and throws her out.)

1439
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,530
What is this?

1440
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,005
Kwang Soo!

1441
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,875
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo are out.)

1442
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:47,675
(Celebrating)

1443
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:50,815
What should I do?

1444
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:53,115
I'm scared.

1445
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,380
(Jong Kook, the Undertaker...)

1446
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:59,510
(and Eun Su with shocking strength)

1447
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,120
I'm scared. Let me out!

1448
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,955
It's like UFC.

1449
00:52:03,223 --> 00:52:04,550
- Help! - Here we go.

1450
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:05,865
- Help! - So Min.

1451
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:10,060
Help!

1452
00:52:10,063 --> 00:52:14,175
(The green sheep are surrounded by black wolves.)

1453
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:17,005
Kwang Soo, just cheat.

1454
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,370
I'm so glad that I'm not in his position.

1455
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:20,715
Please!

1456
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:22,600
I'm so relieved.

1457
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:24,270
He looks like a chicken.

1458
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:26,145
Eun Su, don't look at me.

1459
00:52:26,346 --> 00:52:28,010
Eun Su, don't look at me.

1460
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:29,985
Eun Su!

1461
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:32,710
Eun Su!

1462
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,295
No!

1463
00:52:34,454 --> 00:52:35,450
(Kwang Soo's favorite trunks)

1464
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,665
No!

1465
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,295
- Hey. - Kwang Soo, just get out.

1466
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,590
Let's just give up!

1467
00:52:42,596 --> 00:52:44,760
- Let's give up! - Let's fight just a little longer.

1468
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:46,500
- Just a little longer. - Let's give up!

1469
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,735
- Just get out! - I'm sorry.

1470
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:51,930
I'm sorry.

1471
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:53,300
Let's not give up.

1472
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,215
Give up, you stupid.

1473
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:56,510
I can't give up.

1474
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:00,440
(The husband is beaten up,)

1475
00:53:00,447 --> 00:53:01,680
(and the wife tries to save him.)

1476
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:04,550
Kwang Soo, if I had a towel, I'd throw it at you.

1477
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:07,220
Please. I'm sorry.

1478
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,955
(As expected, Jong Kook and Eun Su win.)

1479
00:53:09,656 --> 00:53:11,050
It'll be so tasty.

1480
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,420
We can't eat, right?

1481
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:15,165
I can't eat? I want to at least see it.

1482
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:16,430
It's bulgogi.

1483
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,190
(Bulgogi hot pot)

1484
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:19,260
Lotus leaf rice.

1485
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:23,005
(Bulgogi and lotus leaf rice taste amazing together.)

1486
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:25,705
All we have is dried seaweed and rice.

1487
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,270
I can't believe this.

1488
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:28,915
Gosh.

1489
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:30,470
Are we eating soy sauce and rice?

1490
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,645
Dried seaweed and rice.

1491
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,715
Eun Su is so strong.

1492
00:53:35,982 --> 00:53:37,350
They're the strongest team.

1493
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,525
I haven't seen such a strong girl in a long time.

1494
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:41,220
She's really strong.

1495
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:43,220
Even Ji Hyo admits it.

1496
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:45,090
She reminds me of Eun Hye.

1497
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,465
Since Eun Hye...

1498
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:53,430
(The strong girl, Yoon Eun Hye, stole Jong Kook's heart.)

1499
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:57,530
(Eun Su reminds everyone of Eun Hye.)

1500
00:53:57,537 --> 00:53:59,200
Since Eun Hye...

1501
00:53:59,206 --> 00:54:03,240
Jong Kook.

1502
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,710
(Of course.)

1503
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,170
Hold on.

1504
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,280
Congratulations, Eun Su.

1505
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,340
(They all celebrate the new couple.)

1506
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:09,555
Okay!

1507
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,485
(Everyone cheers at the potential of becoming a couple.)

1508
00:54:11,518 --> 00:54:14,550
Hold on. I'm okay with everything, but here's what's funny.

1509
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:18,495
When you talk about that, she does this. Why is she doing this?

1510
00:54:18,758 --> 00:54:21,235
- It's my first show. That's why. - She saw too many shows.

1511
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,190
(Eun Su is adorable.)

1512
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:28,230
- Sorry, but is it your birthday? - She's playful.

1513
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,430
- Pardon? - Why are you sitting there alone?

1514
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,440
- Is it your birthday today? - It might as well be my birthday.

1515
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,470
- What's a birthday if not today? - Is that so?

1516
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:37,470
Let's be reasonable, and give me some.

1517
00:54:37,477 --> 00:54:38,640
(It's my birthday.)

1518
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:40,940
- Why? - Why?

1519
00:54:40,947 --> 00:54:43,085
Can you not see that my left eyebrow is gone?

1520
00:54:43,783 --> 00:54:46,350
- We should give some to him. - Come on. Be considerate.

1521
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,725
I brought this upon myself because I was goofing around.

1522
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:51,750
(It was during the dance time for the 2nd round of Lotus Flower War.)

1523
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:55,490
(He got into BTS' "Fake Love".)

1524
00:54:55,495 --> 00:54:59,560
(He was dancing all over the stage just like BTS,)

1525
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:03,775
(but he failed to control his excitement and fell over.)

1526
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,405
(It was painful and embarrassing.)

1527
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,940
(Even the people who were watching were flustered.)

1528
00:55:09,943 --> 00:55:11,415
(Feeling embarrassed)

1529
00:55:11,778 --> 00:55:14,740
(BTS almost hurt a man.)

1530
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:16,910
(He must've been so excited. He jumped all the way up there.)

1531
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,110
(This goofball put on a bandage on his left eyebrow.)

1532
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:20,550
Can you not see that my left eyebrow is gone?

1533
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:23,050
You're such a goofball. Seriously.

1534
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:24,620
(I shouldn't goof around.)

1535
00:55:24,624 --> 00:55:26,450
- We keep eating this. - Try to bring that.

1536
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:27,520
(Doesn't the zucchini pancake look good?)

1537
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:29,590
- The meat is disappearing. - Sneak that in.

1538
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:31,460
- I'm still eating this. - You are?

1539
00:55:31,464 --> 00:55:33,260
- I'm not supposed to eat the leaf. - You are?

1540
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:35,005
(She fixes her eyes on Gook Ju.)

1541
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,800
I'll divide what I eat and what I don't eat.

1542
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:40,040
People get the wrong idea. I'm not mad.

1543
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:43,200
Hey, hey. What was that? Bring that back.

1544
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,915
- Why? - How dare you pull a trick on us?

1545
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:49,040
- You took the zucchini. - We had three pancakes.

1546
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:51,450
- We had three. I checked. - What did he do?

1547
00:55:51,451 --> 00:55:52,680
(What's this under the dried lavers?)

1548
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:55,520
- They are definitely the thieves. - They have to be the thieves.

1549
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:57,520
- Come on, Mr. 40. - No, listen.

1550
00:55:57,524 --> 00:56:01,260
- It's because I'm 40. - It's because you're 40.

1551
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:04,405
- I can't let this fly. - It's because you're 40.

1552
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,660
- They're showing signs of thieves. - That's right.

1553
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:09,860
(This Mr. 50 struggles to overcome the adhesion of his name tag.)

1554
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,570
- Eun Su. - I'm a loyal servant.

1555
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:13,770
- You can just share it with us. - We were in the same team.

1556
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:15,000
- Who? - So Min...

1557
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,710
- We can't just give this to her. - Eun Su.

1558
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,010
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1559
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:21,310
I want to see the mosquito dance.

1560
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:24,550
The mosquitoes bit me a lot, it was itchy

1561
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:25,850
(No problem. We'll both do it.)

1562
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:28,950
(The Mosquito Couple flails out of hunger.)

1563
00:56:28,955 --> 00:56:31,150
I scratched my arm without thinking much

1564
00:56:31,157 --> 00:56:33,690
(It was itchy, but I endured it)

1565
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:35,760
- I wanted to see it in person. - Do you know how to do it?

1566
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:36,990
- What should I show you? - This one.

1567
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:39,060
- Eun Su, thank you. - Gosh, Eun Su is so nice.

1568
00:56:39,065 --> 00:56:42,030
- She gave us so much. - Gosh, she gave you a ton of food.

1569
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:43,600
- Gosh, Eun Su. - Eun Su.

1570
00:56:43,603 --> 00:56:45,430
- Thank you. - This isn't a place for that.

1571
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:48,300
- No, no. Why? - Put that down.

1572
00:56:48,308 --> 00:56:50,140
- Okay, okay. - If you spill it, it's over.

1573
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:52,510
- Okay. Let's talk over there. - Put it down.

1574
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,640
- Why did Eun Su give that to us? - We'll talk at the table.

1575
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:56,750
- Don't do anything stupid. - I won't.

1576
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,150
You two better not fight and eat it at your seats.

1577
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:00,580
- Don't force it. - Listen.

1578
00:57:00,587 --> 00:57:01,680
(They sit down calmly first.)

1579
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,125
- Take it. - Give it to me.

1580
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:04,220
(She gives him the rice cake.)

1581
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:05,750
- Take this much for now. - Give me that one.

1582
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,860
- What was that? Come on. - Hey.

1583
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,690
- Take that for now. - What's this?

1584
00:57:09,696 --> 00:57:10,860
Do it one more time.

1585
00:57:10,864 --> 00:57:12,360
(The meat is mine!)

1586
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:15,060
(Give me the meat!)

1587
00:57:15,068 --> 00:57:18,070
(He begins the forceful process of taking back the meat.)

1588
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:20,345
(This is my first time seeing something like that.)

1589
00:57:20,507 --> 00:57:22,770
(He manages to get the meat out from her mouth.)

1590
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,410
- Look at them. - What are you two doing now?

1591
00:57:24,411 --> 00:57:26,485
(Give me back my meat.)

1592
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,840
(There they go again.)

1593
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:30,950
Goodness, you and So Min are so disgusting.

1594
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:33,125
- Ji Hyo ate the rest of it. - Come on.

1595
00:57:34,688 --> 00:57:36,965
(They're fighting again? Gosh, they have no table manners.)

1596
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:41,635
You should've given them a big portion with a ladle.

1597
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:44,860
(She calmly holds the meat plate and slurps everything in.)

1598
00:57:44,864 --> 00:57:47,300
(Keep fighting. I'll enjoy this.)

1599
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,960
- Ji Hyo ate the rest of it. - Gosh.

1600
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:50,175
(That's amazing.)

1601
00:57:50,904 --> 00:57:52,245
No!

1602
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:57,440
- So Min. - It was right in front of me.

1603
00:57:57,444 --> 00:57:58,910
- Good job. - It was right in front of me.

1604
00:57:58,912 --> 00:58:02,040
- Gook Ju, move your feet. - Hey, it's the same here.

1605
00:58:02,048 --> 00:58:05,985
(Is Jae Seok plotting something to steal the lotus leaf rice meal?)

1606
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:07,695
What is he doing?

1607
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:11,450
- What are you doing? - Just go rest.

1608
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:15,590
Jae Seok, you're going to skin your forehead again.

1609
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:16,860
(Don't hurt yourself. Don't do anything.)

1610
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:18,460
- You'll skin your forehead. - Hey.

1611
00:58:18,465 --> 00:58:20,835
- My goodness. - That won't work.

1612
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:22,605
My gosh.

1613
00:58:23,436 --> 00:58:27,370
Seok Jin, please give me some food.

1614
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:30,510
(This sexy singer tries to scrounge food with the dried laver mole.)

1615
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,410
Come on, she's trying.

1616
00:58:32,412 --> 00:58:34,310
- Do the dance here, Dam Bi. - Seok Jin.

1617
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:36,140
(I'm going crazy)

1618
00:58:36,149 --> 00:58:38,310
- Please give me some. - Okay, okay.

1619
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,655
- You're good. - Sure, sure.

1620
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,455
- You're great. - He's so generous.

1621
00:58:44,124 --> 00:58:46,220
- Gook Ju, do you want the snacks? - Really?

1622
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:48,590
- What is it? - Why? Why is she getting snacks?

1623
00:58:48,595 --> 00:58:50,530
- She said she has a special talent. - I see.

1624
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,160
- Copy her, and you'll get food. - Like this.

1625
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,800
- Really? What is it? - I want to try it too.

1626
00:58:55,802 --> 00:58:57,070
(What's her talent with the snacks?)

1627
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:58,470
- How do you do it? - I did it a long time ago.

1628
00:58:58,471 --> 00:58:59,945
I don't do it anymore.

1629
00:59:00,273 --> 00:59:01,475
- What's that? - I know what it is.

1630
00:59:03,209 --> 00:59:06,645
(Her special talent is popping the snack bag between her thighs.)

1631
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,680
(How does it look in real life?)

1632
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:11,185
No, no. Watch. Just watch.

1633
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,095
What was that?

1634
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:19,150
(So your special talent was popping the bag and rolling next?)

1635
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,490
Gook Ju, did you get shot?

1636
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:24,060
- What's wrong with you? Gook Ju. - Did you get shot?

1637
00:59:24,063 --> 00:59:26,660
- What happened to the snacks? - Did you get shot or not?

1638
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:29,475
- I mean, listen. - The chips are destroyed.

1639
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,570
Did someone shoot her from there?

1640
00:59:32,572 --> 00:59:33,670
(Are you okay? Do you have a gunshot wound?)

1641
00:59:33,673 --> 00:59:36,200
Gook Ju, did you get shot?

1642
00:59:36,209 --> 00:59:38,415
- What's wrong with you? - We heard something pop.

1643
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:40,740
- Are you okay? - You can't use your fingers.

1644
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,940
- Okay. - Can anyone do this?

1645
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:44,250
- Me! - I can just try this?

1646
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,650
- Dam Bi will go first. - I think I can do this.

1647
00:59:47,654 --> 00:59:50,020
- Dam Bi. - Gosh, she's doing her best today.

1648
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:51,290
- You have to do it in 1 go. - 1, 2, 3.

1649
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:52,650
- Can I do it like this? - Yes.

1650
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,465
(Can Dam Bi successfully pop the bag?)

1651
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,700
I think I can do this.

1652
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,160
- Dam Bi. - Gosh, she's doing her best today.

1653
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,960
- You have to do it in 1 go. - 1, 2, 3.

1654
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,600
- Can I do it like this? - Yes.

1655
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,645
(Can Dam Bi successfully pop the bag?)

1656
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:06,430
- She can't do it. - That won't count.

1657
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:08,540
(In a gentle manner,)

1658
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:09,540
(she fails.)

1659
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:11,170
- Dam Bi is out. - I guess that's hard.

1660
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:13,270
- Give me back the snack. - Why can't you do it?

1661
01:00:13,279 --> 01:00:15,410
- You might try to eat the chips. - Why can't I do this?

1662
01:00:15,415 --> 01:00:17,910
- You can sit on it. - How did she pop that?

1663
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:19,655
- One. - You can't do that?

1664
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:22,980
If you can't do it in one go, it won't count.

1665
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:24,820
- So Min can't do it. - So Min is out.

1666
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:26,690
- So Min, why can't you? Let's go! - So Min is out.

1667
01:00:26,693 --> 01:00:28,590
- Ji Hyo is out. - No!

1668
01:00:28,595 --> 01:00:29,860
- You have to do it in one go. - I did it.

1669
01:00:29,863 --> 01:00:31,665
- Can guys try it? - Eun Su.

1670
01:00:31,898 --> 01:00:34,160
- Eun Su. - I'd like to see her try.

1671
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,935
I think she can do it.

1672
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,715
(Eun Su showed the Herculean strength with her thighs.)

1673
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:45,310
If Eun Su succeeds, she'll choose someone to get some food.

1674
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:47,280
- Okay. - We'll give out our food.

1675
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,840
- Eun Su has to try. - You must do it at once.

1676
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:51,985
- I think she'll succeed at once. - 1, 2, 3.

1677
01:00:52,552 --> 01:00:56,725
(Will she become the woman of strength after she pops the bag?)

1678
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,620
(Crushing)

1679
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,360
- Hey. - What was that sound?

1680
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,490
1, 2, 3.

1681
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:03,595
(Crushing)

1682
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:08,435
(What was the sound just now?)

1683
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:10,330
(It sounded too sharp unlike the one before.)

1684
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:12,130
- What was that? - That didn't sound right.

1685
01:01:12,138 --> 01:01:14,500
- She broke her bones. - Didn't your pants get ripped?

1686
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:17,170
- Eun Su, what was that sound? - It ripped.

1687
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:18,770
- But she did it. It popped. - Hey.

1688
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:21,110
- I know that, but the sound... - It should have that popping sound.

1689
01:01:21,114 --> 01:01:23,310
- Didn't it come from her body? - From her body?

1690
01:01:23,316 --> 01:01:26,150
- Seok Jin makes this kind of sound. - My gosh.

1691
01:01:26,152 --> 01:01:27,780
- It sounded like plates. - She pretended to be weak.

1692
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:29,320
- It sounded like something cracked. - I also heard a cracking sound.

1693
01:01:29,322 --> 01:01:31,320
- It sounded like my jeans ripped. - Your jeans are fine.

1694
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:32,890
- Your jeans are fine. - Right.

1695
01:01:32,892 --> 01:01:34,520
I don't think Jae Seok can do it.

1696
01:01:34,527 --> 01:01:37,065
- No, I can do this. - His thighs are slim.

1697
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:39,860
Don't do it. You'll hurt your forehead again.

1698
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:42,000
(Don't do it. You'll hurt your forehead again.)

1699
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:44,300
- You'll hurt yourself. Stop it. - Stay quiet.

1700
01:01:44,304 --> 01:01:46,675
- You'll hurt yourself again. - I'll be fine.

1701
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:49,370
- I'm okay. At least, I'll get food. - Exactly.

1702
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,110
- Jae Seok, what are you today? - What?

1703
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:55,055
Are you Mona Lisa or what?

1704
01:01:55,348 --> 01:01:56,410
(Beauty without eyebrows)

1705
01:01:56,416 --> 01:01:59,150
- Mona Lisa - You don't have the eyebrow.

1706
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:02,350
- Jae Seok, come here. - I still have an eyebrow.

1707
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:04,865
- Come here. I'll put one on you. - Draw it for him.

1708
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:07,590
- Hey. Do it for him. - There you go.

1709
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,265
- It's done. It's done. - All right.

1710
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:11,630
- I have both eyebrows now, right? - You look much better.

1711
01:02:11,631 --> 01:02:13,530
- I have both eyebrows now, right? - It's a much better look.

1712
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:14,905
(Beauty of unbalanced eyebrows)

1713
01:02:15,802 --> 01:02:17,530
- All right. - Go for it!

1714
01:02:17,537 --> 01:02:20,000
- I'll give you this if you succeed. - You only get one chance.

1715
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:21,540
- 1 chance. Okay. - Only 1 chance.

1716
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,870
- You can do this. - Hold on. I think...

1717
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:27,010
every guy can do this. You should put it between your thighs.

1718
01:02:27,013 --> 01:02:28,880
- Between the thighs. - This? This is really hard.

1719
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:31,210
- Really? - I guess she can do that too.

1720
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,310
- Between there? - I haven't done it for a while.

1721
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:35,650
- How do I do this? - Gosh, how can she do that?

1722
01:02:35,655 --> 01:02:37,095
(Popping)

1723
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:40,360
(The bag clearly pops right in the middle.)

1724
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,120
- How's that possible? - This is amazing!

1725
01:02:43,129 --> 01:02:45,365
(This is amazing!)

1726
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:48,360
- Look. I didn't spill the snack. - You didn't spill it.

1727
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,660
I didn't drop the chips.

1728
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:50,930
This buddy tried to come out, though.

1729
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:52,430
She did it just right.

1730
01:02:52,438 --> 01:02:54,075
It's unbelievable.

1731
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,240
- Do men have a chance? - Yes, they do.

1732
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:58,170
- I'll try. - It's amazing she did that.

1733
01:02:58,177 --> 01:03:00,985
- We men will do that in a row. - Okay.

1734
01:03:01,214 --> 01:03:02,580
You should do that in 1, 2, 3.

1735
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:04,055
You're confident.

1736
01:03:04,384 --> 01:03:06,550
- Kwang Soo, you go first. - All right.

1737
01:03:06,552 --> 01:03:10,425
(Kwang Soo succeeds at one go.)

1738
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:13,450
(Se Chan goes next.)

1739
01:03:13,459 --> 01:03:14,665
You failed!

1740
01:03:15,395 --> 01:03:17,990
(His face turns red.)

1741
01:03:17,997 --> 01:03:19,665
Se Chan failed!

1742
01:03:20,233 --> 01:03:22,205
- It doesn't work. - Next! 1, 2, 3!

1743
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:26,875
(Haha succeeds.)

1744
01:03:27,373 --> 01:03:29,970
(People admire the power of his thighs.)

1745
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:31,870
(Only one man is lonely now.)

1746
01:03:31,878 --> 01:03:33,170
Se Chan.

1747
01:03:33,179 --> 01:03:34,580
This one doesn't work.

1748
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,610
It's all right.

1749
01:03:35,615 --> 01:03:37,625
- You're a weak man. - It doesn't work.

1750
01:03:38,317 --> 01:03:39,625
Doesn't it work?

1751
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:41,880
It doesn't.

1752
01:03:41,888 --> 01:03:43,180
It doesn't work.

1753
01:03:43,189 --> 01:03:44,650
It doesn't work all right.

1754
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:46,090
(Haha made it earlier.)

1755
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:47,160
No, it doesn't work.

1756
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,960
(The snack pack stays still despite Haha's giddy act.)

1757
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:50,265
Jong Kook, you should try.

1758
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,630
Jong Kook should do it. Jong Kook, give it a try.

1759
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:55,475
Jong Kook can do it.

1760
01:03:56,602 --> 01:03:58,200
(Nothing's wrong with it. Your thighs are just weak.)

1761
01:03:58,204 --> 01:04:01,575
Jong Kook, you can do it if you use your power at one go.

1762
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:03,775
Look at his muscles.

1763
01:04:04,243 --> 01:04:05,570
(Holding tight)

1764
01:04:05,578 --> 01:04:06,985
- Like this? - Here he goes!

1765
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:08,480
1, 2, 3!

1766
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:09,910
(Can he pop the snack pack with his powerful thighs?)

1767
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:11,525
Gosh, this one doesn't work.

1768
01:04:13,152 --> 01:04:14,320
(The snack pack stays still.)

1769
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,750
Jong Kook can't pop it!

1770
01:04:15,755 --> 01:04:16,955
It doesn't work.

1771
01:04:17,256 --> 01:04:19,225
- It doesn't work. - It doesn't.

1772
01:04:19,525 --> 01:04:20,990
Even Jong Kook can't pop this one. Take it away.

1773
01:04:20,993 --> 01:04:22,990
- It's nonsense. - He picked a wrong one.

1774
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:25,735
- This is a tough snack. - It's a tough snack.

1775
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:27,630
- It doesn't work, Gook Ju. - It doesn't.

1776
01:04:27,633 --> 01:04:29,030
- It's tough. - We can't pop it.

1777
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:31,200
(Lotus leaf rice meal ends with a mysterious snack pack.)

1778
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:33,630
Everyone, did you enjoy your meal?

1779
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:35,140
- Yes! - I'm full.

1780
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:39,215
Jong Kook and Eun Su took the first place in the game earlier,

1781
01:04:39,412 --> 01:04:42,780
so they can select two couples and put them on the platform.

1782
01:04:42,782 --> 01:04:43,880
All right.

1783
01:04:43,883 --> 01:04:45,480
- Here... - First,

1784
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:46,980
So Min and Kwang Soo...

1785
01:04:46,986 --> 01:04:48,250
Let us stand on the platform!

1786
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:49,750
They should absolutely stand on the platform.

1787
01:04:49,755 --> 01:04:51,890
- What are you saying? - It rhymes.

1788
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:52,920
I want to do that myself.

1789
01:04:52,925 --> 01:04:55,220
So Min and Kwang Soo didn't suspect each other at all.

1790
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:56,590
It's strange.

1791
01:04:56,596 --> 01:04:58,160
I suspect Kwang Soo.

1792
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:01,060
- I suspect him. - You'll see.

1793
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:03,905
They didn't suspect each other in the car.

1794
01:05:04,003 --> 01:05:07,770
And about the other couple, as I see it a while ago,

1795
01:05:07,773 --> 01:05:09,600
- these two... - Yes.

1796
01:05:09,609 --> 01:05:10,610
(Us?)

1797
01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:12,440
They put four of us on the platform...

1798
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:14,440
- and if this time... - It's not like that.

1799
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:16,380
- If they were thieves, - Yes.

1800
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:18,380
they would have selected a team with at least one thief...

1801
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:20,920
- and made us confused. - That's right!

1802
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,080
- However, they put four civilians. - You got it!

1803
01:05:23,089 --> 01:05:25,820
- There might be no thief here. - I see.

1804
01:05:25,825 --> 01:05:27,690
- So I'll put them on the platform. - Okay!

1805
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:30,065
What is he saying? Gosh, really.

1806
01:05:30,563 --> 01:05:31,860
All right.

1807
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:33,390
Come on. Here you go.

1808
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:34,500
What?

1809
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,700
What did you say?

1810
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:38,345
I got a hole in my socks. My goodness.

1811
01:05:38,571 --> 01:05:40,770
Dam Bi got a hole in her socks.

1812
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:42,340
You have passion, Dam Bi. I like that.

1813
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:45,470
- She really does her best. - She's changed over eight years.

1814
01:05:45,478 --> 01:05:47,280
She has changed a lot over eight years.

1815
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,685
(Dam Bi slaps Haha on the shoulder.)

1816
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:50,925
Gosh, it really hurts.

1817
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:53,510
By the way, Dam Bi,

1818
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:55,780
what has happened to you for the last eight years?

1819
01:05:55,788 --> 01:05:59,420
The result is out.

1820
01:05:59,425 --> 01:06:01,590
- This is important. - I'm curious.

1821
01:06:01,594 --> 01:06:02,860
This is important.

1822
01:06:02,862 --> 01:06:04,290
(1 King, 1 Boss, 4 thieves are not found yet.)

1823
01:06:04,297 --> 01:06:06,890
There must be one thief among them without question.

1824
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:08,260
There must be at least one.

1825
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:10,500
- There should be about 2. - Of course there are more than 2.

1826
01:06:10,503 --> 01:06:13,130
As a result of the second judgment,

1827
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:15,740
the number of thieves among these four...

1828
01:06:15,741 --> 01:06:18,340
(The number of thieves among these four)

1829
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:21,510
(So Min and Kwang Soo didn't suspect each other at all today.)

1830
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:25,480
(Dam Bi and Haha put four civilians on the platform.)

1831
01:06:25,484 --> 01:06:27,155
The number of thieves...

1832
01:06:27,787 --> 01:06:29,095
is three.

1833
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:30,750
- See? - It's three.

1834
01:06:30,756 --> 01:06:32,050
(The number of thieves among these 4 people are 3.)

1835
01:06:32,058 --> 01:06:33,550
(3 out of 4 are thieves.)

1836
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:34,760
I can't believe it.

1837
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,060
(3 of them are thieves and they've met before the opening.)

1838
01:06:36,062 --> 01:06:37,805
- I told you. - Unbelievable.

1839
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:40,900
- I told you. - You're framing us again.

1840
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,760
- Really? - She's framing us like that.

1841
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:44,500
Is that true?

1842
01:06:44,503 --> 01:06:46,270
I really heard it in detail.

1843
01:06:46,272 --> 01:06:47,540
It's not me. I mean it.

1844
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,145
Dam Bi, what was that you said in the car?

1845
01:06:51,277 --> 01:06:52,745
And,

1846
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:54,955
the other is...

1847
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:57,450
a Boss.

1848
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:59,510
(A Boss)

1849
01:06:59,518 --> 01:07:01,520
(3 thieves and 1 Boss)

1850
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,580
- Unbelievable! - I can believe it!

1851
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:03,780
I told you.

1852
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:05,350
It's incredible.

1853
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:07,620
You're mean.

1854
01:07:07,627 --> 01:07:10,490
Wait a minute. That means all of them are thieves.

1855
01:07:10,496 --> 01:07:13,290
(All of them are thieves.)

1856
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:14,660
They're all thieves.

1857
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:16,000
Gosh, they're thieves!

1858
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:18,130
- To sum up, - It comes out in the open.

1859
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:21,745
3 of these 4 have known one another already.

1860
01:07:22,742 --> 01:07:24,340
I really got goose bumps.

1861
01:07:24,343 --> 01:07:26,710
- Stop acting! - Dam Bi, please.

1862
01:07:26,712 --> 01:07:28,415
Then, wait a minute.

1863
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:30,410
Stop acting!

1864
01:07:30,416 --> 01:07:32,180
Then one of these is...

1865
01:07:32,184 --> 01:07:34,980
I'll tell you what was really funny.

1866
01:07:34,987 --> 01:07:39,125
When he said there are three thieves,

1867
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:41,260
Dam Bi stared into the air.

1868
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:44,360
I didn't stare into the air, Jong Kook!

1869
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:45,905
(Dam Bi reacted suspiciously earlier.)

1870
01:07:46,399 --> 01:07:49,635
(She didn't know what to do.)

1871
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:51,370
(What did Dam Bi's response mean?)

1872
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:53,675
She didn't look around the members, but she stared into the air.

1873
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:56,070
Gosh, really.

1874
01:07:56,075 --> 01:07:58,315
Are you framing me this way?

1875
01:07:58,377 --> 01:08:00,285
(Was everyone acting?)

1876
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,340
I know that there's one thief left there.

1877
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:05,885
Excuse me, but it seems that you have nothing to do with this.

1878
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:07,655
Aren't you just being mischievous?

1879
01:08:07,753 --> 01:08:09,325
You're just being naughty, right?

1880
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:11,150
I'm not being mischievous.

1881
01:08:11,157 --> 01:08:13,520
You seem to be a cilvilian without an eyebrow.

1882
01:08:13,526 --> 01:08:15,760
I'm not being naughty.

1883
01:08:15,761 --> 01:08:16,760
You're being mischievous.

1884
01:08:16,762 --> 01:08:18,935
You should draw your eyebrow.

1885
01:08:18,998 --> 01:08:20,860
- She can take care of it. - Can she?

1886
01:08:20,866 --> 01:08:22,330
Please draw my eyebrow.

1887
01:08:22,335 --> 01:08:23,800
Draw it like a real eyebrow.

1888
01:08:23,803 --> 01:08:26,130
What would you have done without the marker today?

1889
01:08:26,138 --> 01:08:28,215
Draw it lightly.

1890
01:08:28,908 --> 01:08:30,240
He got his eyebrow tattooed.

1891
01:08:30,242 --> 01:08:31,240
It's much better, right?

1892
01:08:31,243 --> 01:08:33,140
- It's good. - You should draw that side too.

1893
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:34,540
(How does Jae Seok's new eyebrow drawn by Gook Ju look?)

1894
01:08:34,547 --> 01:08:35,940
It's fine.

1895
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:37,210
You should draw here more.

1896
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:38,585
It looks very natural, right?

1897
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:40,980
It's a little bit raised, though.

1898
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:44,425
- That's why people tattoo eyebrows. - I'm surprised.

1899
01:08:44,457 --> 01:08:45,720
- Jae Seok! - It's good, isn't it?

1900
01:08:45,725 --> 01:08:47,565
Where have you been?

1901
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:49,620
I had a tape on my eyebrow a while ago.

1902
01:08:49,628 --> 01:08:50,760
May I speak now?

1903
01:08:50,763 --> 01:08:53,135
You look charismatic. You look like this now.

1904
01:08:53,332 --> 01:08:54,900
You're not feeling well, right?

1905
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,500
You're like Dwayne Johnson.

1906
01:08:57,503 --> 01:08:59,230
Are you framing me like this?

1907
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:00,530
Wait minute. On the contrary,

1908
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:02,645
then civilians are...

1909
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:06,370
- among the rest of these people... - We're four.

1910
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:09,240
- 1 of 4... - 1 of 4 here is a thief.

1911
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:11,110
There are a thief and a King here.

1912
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:13,125
- Please. - Because...

1913
01:09:13,185 --> 01:09:17,180
(A King and a thief are here.)

1914
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:19,420
You really act well.

1915
01:09:19,425 --> 01:09:22,120
- I swear. - I really swear.

1916
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:23,320
Ji Hyo, you're a thief, aren't you?

1917
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:24,430
I swear, Jong Kook.

1918
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,905
Don't regret this later.

1919
01:09:27,066 --> 01:09:28,930
- There's a King. - I really...

1920
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:31,005
(Which team will have the last laugh?)

1921
01:09:32,171 --> 01:09:34,200
I have no idea.

1922
01:09:34,206 --> 01:09:35,870
I have no idea either.

1923
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:38,715
By the way, from the first round,

1924
01:09:38,878 --> 01:09:40,370
we're so mixed up.

1925
01:09:40,379 --> 01:09:42,710
(We're really mixed up.)

1926
01:09:42,715 --> 01:09:44,110
See it this way.

1927
01:09:44,116 --> 01:09:46,080
You're...

1928
01:09:46,085 --> 01:09:48,620
If you're thieves,

1929
01:09:48,621 --> 01:09:51,650
you should have put the team with a thief on the platform.

1930
01:09:51,657 --> 01:09:54,865
At that time, we lacked judgment.

1931
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:58,360
No, it happened while we were going back and forth.

1932
01:09:58,364 --> 01:09:59,730
And I...

1933
01:09:59,732 --> 01:10:02,430
Then if there were a thief and a Boss...

1934
01:10:02,435 --> 01:10:04,905
among these two,

1935
01:10:05,304 --> 01:10:06,430
you might have not known that.

1936
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:09,170
That's for sure.

1937
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:10,340
That's a rule,

1938
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:11,970
(What if they are a Boss and a thief who don't know each other?)

1939
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:14,840
You put only civilians on the platform as you didn't know.

1940
01:10:14,847 --> 01:10:17,280
(You put only civilians on the platform as you didn't know.)

1941
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:18,610
That's possible.

1942
01:10:18,617 --> 01:10:20,955
Wait a minute. I won't speak anymore.

1943
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,350
Then one of you...

1944
01:10:22,354 --> 01:10:24,690
Here we see a field.

1945
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,890
- One of you... - Here are trees.

1946
01:10:26,892 --> 01:10:30,465
might be a Boss.

1947
01:10:30,563 --> 01:10:32,890
Why are you looking straight suddenly?

1948
01:10:32,898 --> 01:10:34,700
- That's possible... - That's possible.

1949
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,900
or not.

1950
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:38,430
On the first round, they were...

1951
01:10:38,437 --> 01:10:40,000
I have no idea.

1952
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:42,815
I'm just a civilian. I don't know. It's complicated.

1953
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:44,410
I still don't get the rule.

1954
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:46,415
- I'll ask just one thing, Seok Jin. - Go ahead.

1955
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:48,415
May I call you the King?

1956
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:51,625
You can do that. I don't care. But I'm not a King.

1957
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:53,810
I'm not on the civilian's side,

1958
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:55,950
and I have no idea. But I'm not a King.

1959
01:10:55,955 --> 01:10:57,255
I'm just a civilian.

1960
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,190
It's somewhat strange. He twisted words.

1961
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:00,665
You're a King, Seok Jin.

1962
01:11:00,826 --> 01:11:02,590
Listen to me.

1963
01:11:02,595 --> 01:11:03,935
You don't know what I am.

1964
01:11:03,963 --> 01:11:06,390
You don't know. You're asking me if I am a King.

1965
01:11:06,398 --> 01:11:08,200
That means I'm not a thief, right?

1966
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,105
No. You fixed it this way.

1967
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:12,705
Thieves fixed it up.

1968
01:11:12,838 --> 01:11:15,070
- It's driving me crazy. - You did that.

1969
01:11:15,074 --> 01:11:17,370
Who's the thief you have in your mind?

1970
01:11:17,376 --> 01:11:18,740
It's you.

1971
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:22,140
- Who's the King? - You're the one thief left.

1972
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:23,985
I don't know about the King. I should look for that.

1973
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:27,310
Why do you look for the King? You should look for the thief.

1974
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:29,350
I've found the thief. I've done that already.

1975
01:11:29,355 --> 01:11:31,920
You should look for a Thief Prince.

1976
01:11:31,924 --> 01:11:33,190
Is there a Thief Prince?

1977
01:11:33,192 --> 01:11:34,890
Isn't it a Boss?

1978
01:11:34,894 --> 01:11:36,420
What's a Thief Prince?

1979
01:11:36,428 --> 01:11:37,760
I mean a Boss.

1980
01:11:37,763 --> 01:11:38,830
I should look for a Boss.

1981
01:11:38,831 --> 01:11:41,635
We don't have to talk at all. We can find it as they keep talking.

1982
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:46,770
If there's no King here, it's either Se Chan or Ji Hyo.

1983
01:11:46,772 --> 01:11:48,545
The King knows everything.

1984
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:51,070
What comes last?

1985
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:52,410
What's that?

1986
01:11:52,411 --> 01:11:53,440
(What's that?)

1987
01:11:53,445 --> 01:11:54,855
Why are constables there?

1988
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:57,340
- There are constables? - Yes.

1989
01:11:57,349 --> 01:11:59,625
What's that? Are they really going to flog us?

1990
01:12:00,019 --> 01:12:02,580
- It looks like they'll flog us. - Do we have to get flogged?

1991
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:04,295
(What's the last mission for them here?)

1992
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:06,665
It's cool now.

1993
01:12:06,792 --> 01:12:08,690
Now that it's time for us to get wet...

1994
01:12:08,694 --> 01:12:10,695
Seriously, it's time to get wet.

1995
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,805
Thieves gather together.

1996
01:12:15,234 --> 01:12:17,775
It's so obvious.

1997
01:12:18,203 --> 01:12:20,505
They're conspiring in a group.

1998
01:12:20,539 --> 01:12:23,845
Are you thieves acting like that explicitly?

1999
01:12:23,976 --> 01:12:26,915
- You're amazing. - It's incredible.

2000
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:28,980
Here's the last mission.

2001
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:31,825
We'll proceed with Get Together for the Right Answer.

2002
01:12:32,318 --> 01:12:33,480
Get Together for the Right Answer.

2003
01:12:33,485 --> 01:12:34,955
We need to win this first.

2004
01:12:35,421 --> 01:12:37,095
Listen to the question and examples,

2005
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:39,625
dance to the children's song,

2006
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:42,690
dance to the children's song,

2007
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:43,990
We're dancing all along.

2008
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:46,590
- They love dancing. - How much are we dancing today?

2009
01:12:46,599 --> 01:12:48,360
Why are we dancing so much?

2010
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:50,100
(Gook Ju loves to dance.)

2011
01:12:50,102 --> 01:12:53,675
- In the brook is a tadpole - Are yo doing this because of her?

2012
01:12:54,173 --> 01:12:57,500
I feel like this game is designed for Gook Ju.

2013
01:12:57,509 --> 01:12:59,140
Is this Lee Gook Ju's Running Man?

2014
01:12:59,144 --> 01:13:02,040
Let me dance. Let me dance.

2015
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:04,585
Jae Seok loves to dance too.

2016
01:13:04,984 --> 01:13:07,350
- So we dance. - When you hear the whistle,

2017
01:13:07,353 --> 01:13:08,780
make a group of people...

2018
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:10,655
in the number of the correct answer.

2019
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:12,590
If you think number three is the answer,

2020
01:13:12,591 --> 01:13:15,395
make a group of three.

2021
01:13:15,861 --> 01:13:18,430
If the group's answer is correct, each member gets one point.

2022
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,090
The couple with the highest score...

2023
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:23,560
will get to decide which couples go up the platform.

2024
01:13:23,569 --> 01:13:25,330
If your answer is incorrect,

2025
01:13:25,337 --> 01:13:27,430
the policemen will give a random penalty.

2026
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:29,400
- What? - Please form a group with caution.

2027
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:32,185
That will be hard.

2028
01:13:32,778 --> 01:13:34,040
A random penalty.

2029
01:13:34,046 --> 01:13:37,210
Here comes the first question.

2030
01:13:37,216 --> 01:13:40,650
Among the following, which one is a pure Korean word?

2031
01:13:40,653 --> 01:13:42,150
It will be hard.

2032
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:44,250
This kind of a question is hard.

2033
01:13:44,256 --> 01:13:46,390
They always give the most difficult questions.

2034
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:48,090
Number one, trotter.

2035
01:13:48,093 --> 01:13:50,135
Number two, bossam.

2036
01:13:50,262 --> 01:13:52,365
- What? - Number three, sundae.

2037
01:13:52,431 --> 01:13:54,160
Number four, hotteok.

2038
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,300
- A pure Korean word? - Number five, porridge.

2039
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:58,145
- Is there only 1 answer? - Is there only 1 answer?

2040
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:00,475
Pick an answer.

2041
01:14:00,673 --> 01:14:01,840
Isn't it sundae?

2042
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,200
A pure Korean word.

2043
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:05,115
- A pure Korean word. - A pure Korean word.

2044
01:14:05,144 --> 01:14:06,670
Are we picking an answer that isn't a pure Korean word?

2045
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:08,080
We are picking an answer that is a pure Korean word.

2046
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,080
Isn't it hotteok?

2047
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,280
- Is it number four? - I think it's sundae.

2048
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:12,480
- Hotteok. - Are you certain?

2049
01:14:12,484 --> 01:14:14,350
Hotteok must be an onomatopoeia.

2050
01:14:14,353 --> 01:14:15,580
Is it hotteok?

2051
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:16,925
Number four.

2052
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:18,620
We need to dance.

2053
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:20,150
(The song signals the start of the dance.)

2054
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,260
Let's go.

2055
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,890
(They begin to dance.)

2056
01:14:23,896 --> 01:14:26,435
(Dancing)

2057
01:14:27,232 --> 01:14:29,960
Seok Jin, shouldn't you dance over there?

2058
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,570
Go away. You are making us uncomfortable.

2059
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,475
- Go away. - I am not a thief.

2060
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:36,270
Shouldn't you dance over there?

2061
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:38,910
(Thieves mingle with civilians.)

2062
01:14:38,911 --> 01:14:40,545
Don't do this to me.

2063
01:14:41,113 --> 01:14:43,010
(Whistling)

2064
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:44,215
What?

2065
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:46,610
(Thieves and Seok Jin form a group to pick number 5.)

2066
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:47,680
Is it number five?

2067
01:14:47,686 --> 01:14:49,450
- Is it number five? - I don't know what to do.

2068
01:14:49,455 --> 01:14:51,790
Is it number 3? Is it number 3?

2069
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:53,395
I guess we are a group.

2070
01:14:54,026 --> 01:14:55,460
- Number three. - The answers are divided.

2071
01:14:55,461 --> 01:14:57,635
You chose numbers 3, 4, and 5.

2072
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,730
The answer is...

2073
01:14:58,731 --> 01:15:02,060
(Which one is the answer?)

2074
01:15:02,067 --> 01:15:04,470
- number three, sundae. - Okay!

2075
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,530
- Number three, sundae. - Okay!

2076
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:08,400
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Gook Ju get it right.)

2077
01:15:08,407 --> 01:15:10,540
- It's number three. - I told you so.

2078
01:15:10,542 --> 01:15:11,910
(Our answers are wrong.)

2079
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:13,470
(Shouting)

2080
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:14,685
What?

2081
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:18,680
What is going on?

2082
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:23,655
(The policemen hit them with flour.)

2083
01:15:24,656 --> 01:15:28,260
(We are safe.)

2084
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,860
(Their faces turn white thanks to the flour.)

2085
01:15:29,862 --> 01:15:31,330
Ji Hyo.

2086
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,660
How can you put flour in my eye?

2087
01:15:33,665 --> 01:15:36,860
(This thief becomes angry.)

2088
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:39,430
(Her eyeball is especially white.)

2089
01:15:39,438 --> 01:15:42,070
- Is the answer sundae? - Seriously.

2090
01:15:42,074 --> 01:15:45,210
Trotter uses a Chinese letter for "Foot".

2091
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,710
Bossam uses a Chinese letter for "Blanket".

2092
01:15:47,713 --> 01:15:50,140
Hotteok uses a Chinese letter for "Barbarian".

2093
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:52,210
Porridge uses a Chinese letter for "Porridge".

2094
01:15:52,217 --> 01:15:55,180
We knew the answer, but there were four people left.

2095
01:15:55,187 --> 01:15:59,425
(Se Chan, Ji Hyo, and Gook Ju succeed to get 1 point each.)

2096
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:01,965
- The next one is a picture quiz. - That's good.

2097
01:16:02,294 --> 01:16:04,665
In the following picture,

2098
01:16:04,963 --> 01:16:07,660
- which person isn't present? - "Which person isn't present?"

2099
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:10,205
- This is hard. - Number one, Song Ji Hyo.

2100
01:16:10,335 --> 01:16:13,530
Number 2, Song Hye Kyo. Number 3, Jun Ji Hyun.

2101
01:16:13,539 --> 01:16:15,740
Number 4, Lee Young Ae. Number 5, Kim Hye Soo.

2102
01:16:15,741 --> 01:16:18,040
The combined faces...

2103
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:19,470
(My goodness.)

2104
01:16:19,478 --> 01:16:20,940
I think I am in love.

2105
01:16:20,946 --> 01:16:22,555
(His eyes go wide.)

2106
01:16:22,614 --> 01:16:23,780
I think I am in love.

2107
01:16:23,782 --> 01:16:26,350
(The combined faces are beautiful.)

2108
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:27,750
She is in it.

2109
01:16:27,753 --> 01:16:29,355
Ji Hyo, are you in it or not?

2110
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:30,950
Ji Hyo, are you in it or not?

2111
01:16:30,956 --> 01:16:32,390
- I don't know. - Ji Hyo is in it?

2112
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:34,790
- How about Jun Ji Hyun? - Dance.

2113
01:16:34,793 --> 01:16:36,490
- Number three isn't present. - Dance.

2114
01:16:36,495 --> 01:16:38,190
Number three isn't present, is it?

2115
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:39,890
- Jun Ji Hyun isn't present. - I don't have a clue.

2116
01:16:39,898 --> 01:16:41,300
Jun Ji Hyun isn't present.

2117
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,500
Let's pick number three.

2118
01:16:42,501 --> 01:16:43,905
Jun Ji Hyun isn't present.

2119
01:16:44,102 --> 01:16:45,375
She isn't, right?

2120
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,630
- Is Song Ji Hyo in it? Where? - Yes, she is.

2121
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:49,115
She is in it.

2122
01:16:49,808 --> 01:16:51,170
(Both civilians and thieves think the answer is number 3.)

2123
01:16:51,176 --> 01:16:52,715
Number three.

2124
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:54,310
Save me.

2125
01:16:54,313 --> 01:16:56,210
- You are in. - We are a group.

2126
01:16:56,215 --> 01:16:57,540
- Come here. - You are in.

2127
01:16:57,549 --> 01:16:59,150
I think number three is the answer.

2128
01:16:59,151 --> 01:17:00,685
(I think number 3 is the answer.)

2129
01:17:01,153 --> 01:17:02,350
I will count people in each group.

2130
01:17:02,354 --> 01:17:03,650
He latched onto us.

2131
01:17:03,655 --> 01:17:05,650
(Kwang Soo latches onto another group.)

2132
01:17:05,657 --> 01:17:07,820
- I will count people in each group. - He latched onto us.

2133
01:17:07,826 --> 01:17:09,590
- He latched onto us. - He latched onto us.

2134
01:17:09,595 --> 01:17:10,790
Kwang Soo latched onto us.

2135
01:17:10,796 --> 01:17:12,360
3, 3, 4, 2.

2136
01:17:12,364 --> 01:17:13,930
- For goodness' sake. - The answer is...

2137
01:17:13,932 --> 01:17:15,275
We might be right.

2138
01:17:16,034 --> 01:17:17,230
Number four, Lee Young Ae.

2139
01:17:17,236 --> 01:17:19,200
- Are you serious? - Our answer is correct.

2140
01:17:19,204 --> 01:17:20,270
Number four, Lee Young Ae.

2141
01:17:20,272 --> 01:17:23,575
(Our answer is correct.)

2142
01:17:24,109 --> 01:17:27,370
(It's time for a penalty.)

2143
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:29,385
- Our answer is correct. - Our answer is correct.

2144
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:31,925
- This is incredible. - It was pure luck.

2145
01:17:32,451 --> 01:17:35,120
- It's all thanks to Kwang Soo. - Thank you, Kwang Soo.

2146
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,720
- Thank you. - Kwang Soo, thank you.

2147
01:17:37,723 --> 01:17:39,395
We got it right thanks to Kwang Soo.

2148
01:17:39,825 --> 01:17:41,490
Lee Young Ae isn't present.

2149
01:17:41,493 --> 01:17:43,760
- The combined faces are beautiful. - Seriously.

2150
01:17:43,762 --> 01:17:45,930
Doesn't the picture resemble Lee Young Ae?

2151
01:17:45,931 --> 01:17:48,005
Thus,

2152
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,530
the winning couple is Yang Se Chan and Song Ji Hyo.

2153
01:17:51,536 --> 01:17:54,170
(Se Chan and Ji Hyo win with 3 points.)

2154
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:56,145
All right. We did it.

2155
01:17:56,942 --> 01:17:58,615
You keep moving further away.

2156
01:17:58,677 --> 01:18:00,870
- Why are you running away? - You keep moving further away.

2157
01:18:00,879 --> 01:18:03,285
(Was Kwang Soo's mistake a coincidence or a strategy?)

2158
01:18:04,216 --> 01:18:06,150
(The last platforms)

2159
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:08,595
Se Chan and Ji Hyo,

2160
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:12,390
please choose the two couples that will go up the last platforms.

2161
01:18:12,391 --> 01:18:13,450
We choose...

2162
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:15,990
(Which couples are fated...)

2163
01:18:15,994 --> 01:18:17,660
(to go up the platforms?)

2164
01:18:17,663 --> 01:18:20,890
- We choose Haha and Dam Bi. - What?

2165
01:18:20,899 --> 01:18:22,060
- Okay. - Why?

2166
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:24,060
- We choose Haha and Dam Bi. - What?

2167
01:18:24,069 --> 01:18:27,045
(They decide to make Haha and Dam Bi go up the platform again.)

2168
01:18:27,272 --> 01:18:29,540
You know that I am not a thief, right?

2169
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:31,070
- I know. - You know, right?

2170
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:32,510
- Ji Hyo isn't a thief? - No.

2171
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:34,140
- Are you sure? Why? - Yes.

2172
01:18:34,146 --> 01:18:35,380
I am the King.

2173
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:40,125
(I am the King.)

2174
01:18:40,919 --> 01:18:42,420
Se Chan is the King.

2175
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:43,750
(Is Se Chan the King?)

2176
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:45,420
- Really? - Yes.

2177
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:46,895
- You are the King. - Yes.

2178
01:18:47,192 --> 01:18:48,565
Serve me.

2179
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:50,795
- I did a good job, right? - Are you serious?

2180
01:18:51,263 --> 01:18:52,735
I did a good job, right?

2181
01:18:52,931 --> 01:18:56,205
I also know who the Boss is.

2182
01:18:56,902 --> 01:18:58,230
The Boss.

2183
01:18:58,236 --> 01:18:59,900
(Who is the Boss?)

2184
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:02,745
- Dam Bi. - I knew it.

2185
01:19:03,442 --> 01:19:04,810
(That's why he is making Dam Bi go up the platform again.)

2186
01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:06,345
Why would you go that?

2187
01:19:07,512 --> 01:19:08,715
We also choose...

2188
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:11,955
- Jong Kook and... - Hey.

2189
01:19:12,284 --> 01:19:14,380
- Eun Su. - Okay. Fine.

2190
01:19:14,386 --> 01:19:16,625
- They know you are civilians. - Okay.

2191
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:18,395
They know you are civilians.

2192
01:19:18,557 --> 01:19:19,750
- This is incredible. - Okay.

2193
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:21,820
(It's a strategy to hide information about the King.)

2194
01:19:21,827 --> 01:19:22,890
This is huge.

2195
01:19:22,894 --> 01:19:25,665
- I will make the announcement. - Okay.

2196
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:27,660
The third judgment revealed that...

2197
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,300
(The result of the last judgment)

2198
01:19:29,301 --> 01:19:30,900
among the two couples...

2199
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:33,630
(Is either Haha or Dam Bi the Boss...)

2200
01:19:33,638 --> 01:19:35,540
- Dam Bi. - I knew it.

2201
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:38,910
(like Se Chan said?)

2202
01:19:38,910 --> 01:19:40,570
Among the two couples,

2203
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:43,510
there are 1 thief and 1 Boss.

2204
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:44,680
I knew it.

2205
01:19:44,683 --> 01:19:46,450
(Among the 2 couples, there are 1 thief and 1 Boss.)

2206
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:47,510
(Either Haha or Dam Bi is the Boss.)

2207
01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:48,880
One of them is the Boss.

2208
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:51,820
(Either Haha or Dam Bi is the Boss.)

2209
01:19:51,823 --> 01:19:53,490
Who is the Boss?

2210
01:19:53,492 --> 01:19:56,395
You won't know until the very end.

2211
01:19:56,461 --> 01:20:00,630
We will have the final vote to arrest the Boss.

2212
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:02,830
- The Boss. - We just need to catch the Boss.

2213
01:20:02,834 --> 01:20:04,730
Based on the results of the judgments,

2214
01:20:04,736 --> 01:20:07,845
vote for the person you think is the Boss.

2215
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:11,745
Two people with the most votes will go up the platform.

2216
01:20:11,777 --> 01:20:13,770
The winning team will administer...

2217
01:20:13,779 --> 01:20:16,780
the water bomb penalty to the losing team.

2218
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:20,325
If both the King and the Boss go up the platform,

2219
01:20:20,385 --> 01:20:23,480
the final match will determine the losing team.

2220
01:20:23,488 --> 01:20:25,320
If neither the King nor the Boss gets caught,

2221
01:20:25,323 --> 01:20:27,950
everyone will receive the water bomb penalty.

2222
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:29,295
(Everyone will receive the water bomb penalty.)

2223
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:32,235
Take the ballot.

2224
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:33,905
Did you write down the name?

2225
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,235
It's her, right?

2226
01:20:36,401 --> 01:20:39,100
Dam Bi? It's obvious.

2227
01:20:39,104 --> 01:20:40,770
- Hold on. - In that case,

2228
01:20:40,772 --> 01:20:42,745
whose name should we write down?

2229
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:46,240
(Between Seok Jin, Gook Ju, Se Chan, and Ji Hyo, who is the King?)

2230
01:20:46,244 --> 01:20:49,585
Hold on. Hold on. Here is what I think.

2231
01:20:49,948 --> 01:20:52,850
(He is writing down Dam Bi's name.)

2232
01:20:52,851 --> 01:20:54,125
It's Haha.

2233
01:20:54,186 --> 01:20:55,820
- Isn't it Dam Bi? - It's Haha.

2234
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:56,780
(The Boss is Haha.)

2235
01:20:56,788 --> 01:20:58,020
- Really? - It's Haha.

2236
01:20:58,023 --> 01:20:59,995
- Isn't it Dam Bi? - It's Haha.

2237
01:21:00,058 --> 01:21:02,090
- Isn't it Dam Bi? - It's Haha.

2238
01:21:02,094 --> 01:21:04,620
(Is Haha the Boss?)

2239
01:21:04,629 --> 01:21:06,890
The King is Se Chan.

2240
01:21:06,898 --> 01:21:09,075
I don't know if it's true.

2241
01:21:09,201 --> 01:21:10,330
The King...

2242
01:21:10,335 --> 01:21:11,970
(They mumble so that the other team won't hear.)

2243
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:14,170
- Did you talk to him? - Yes.

2244
01:21:14,172 --> 01:21:16,240
Did Se Chan say that he is the King?

2245
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:18,345
- What? - Did Se Chan say that?

2246
01:21:18,477 --> 01:21:19,610
The King...

2247
01:21:19,611 --> 01:21:21,170
(The King...)

2248
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:23,680
Seok Jin said that he is the King.

2249
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:26,980
(Seok Jin said that he is the King.)

2250
01:21:26,985 --> 01:21:31,795
(Is Seok Jin the King?)

2251
01:21:31,923 --> 01:21:34,820
I am the King. Write Haha's name. He is the Boss.

2252
01:21:34,826 --> 01:21:38,490
(I am the King. Write Haha's name. He is the Boss.)

2253
01:21:38,497 --> 01:21:40,535
It's true. It's true.

2254
01:21:40,832 --> 01:21:43,030
- No way. - Trust me.

2255
01:21:43,034 --> 01:21:45,530
I am not kidding. It's true.

2256
01:21:45,537 --> 01:21:52,910
(Seok Jin says he is the King and Haha is the Boss.)

2257
01:21:52,911 --> 01:21:54,980
- He isn't the King. - This is driving me crazy.

2258
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,055
- He told me that. - He isn't the King.

2259
01:21:57,282 --> 01:22:00,150
- What should I do? - Hold on. This is...

2260
01:22:00,152 --> 01:22:01,620
This is...

2261
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:02,850
(Se Chan says Dam Bi is the Boss and Seok Jin says Haha is the Boss.)

2262
01:22:02,854 --> 01:22:04,995
- Dam Bi is the Boss. - Right?

2263
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:10,590
(Who is telling the truth?)

2264
01:22:10,595 --> 01:22:12,460
Think about it.

2265
01:22:12,464 --> 01:22:15,000
- This is so confusing. - What is going on?

2266
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,330
This is driving me crazy.

2267
01:22:16,334 --> 01:22:17,730
(The civilians become confused.)

2268
01:22:17,736 --> 01:22:18,945
Are you doing okay?

2269
01:22:19,404 --> 01:22:21,370
Stop saying that I am a thief.

2270
01:22:21,373 --> 01:22:22,570
(Among the 4 of them, there are 1 King and 1 thief.)

2271
01:22:22,574 --> 01:22:24,370
They are confused.

2272
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:25,540
In that case...

2273
01:22:25,544 --> 01:22:27,210
- Among the four of you... - Trust him.

2274
01:22:27,212 --> 01:22:29,055
- What? - He is telling the truth.

2275
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:31,340
Se Chan isn't the King.

2276
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:33,610
He isn't the King. He is a thief.

2277
01:22:33,618 --> 01:22:37,250
- No, he isn't. - He is a thief.

2278
01:22:37,255 --> 01:22:40,290
- He is a thief. - Who am I supposed to trust?

2279
01:22:40,292 --> 01:22:41,890
This is confusing.

2280
01:22:41,893 --> 01:22:43,090
- Hold on. - You have 10 seconds.

2281
01:22:43,094 --> 01:22:44,260
- Hold on. - Hold on.

2282
01:22:44,262 --> 01:22:45,390
I am sorry.

2283
01:22:45,397 --> 01:22:48,035
- You have 10 seconds. - For goodness' sake.

2284
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:50,200
- 10. - I wrote down Gook Ju.

2285
01:22:50,202 --> 01:22:51,600
I wrote like this.

2286
01:22:51,603 --> 01:22:53,370
No, this is right, Jae Seok.

2287
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:54,500
No, I wrote this.

2288
01:22:54,506 --> 01:22:56,745
- Let's go. - Seven,

2289
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:59,610
- six, - I wrote like this.

2290
01:22:59,611 --> 01:23:02,180
- It might be wrong. - I have no idea.

2291
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,740
four,

2292
01:23:03,748 --> 01:23:05,580
three,

2293
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:06,950
(Thieves don't have enough clue as they've lost the last game.)

2294
01:23:06,952 --> 01:23:07,950
two,

2295
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:08,950
(What choice did civilians and thieves make?)

2296
01:23:08,954 --> 01:23:09,950
one!

2297
01:23:09,955 --> 01:23:11,220
(What choice did civilians and thieves make?)

2298
01:23:11,223 --> 01:23:12,890
Please submit your votes!

2299
01:23:12,891 --> 01:23:15,360
(Vote closed.)

2300
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,805
- This is so hard. - Gosh.

2301
01:23:19,164 --> 01:23:22,735
- This is so tough. - We made a right decision.

2302
01:23:22,801 --> 01:23:26,730
How can you work together for so long with such a relationship?

2303
01:23:26,738 --> 01:23:28,000
(They all act so well.)

2304
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,470
I'm so confused.

2305
01:23:29,474 --> 01:23:34,715
Two people with the largest number of votes will stand on the platform.

2306
01:23:34,846 --> 01:23:36,280
It's unbelievable.

2307
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:38,010
(2 people with the largest number of votes will stand on the platform.)

2308
01:23:38,016 --> 01:23:41,950
We have people with 6 votes, 5 votes, and 1 vote.

2309
01:23:41,953 --> 01:23:43,380
- Who got one vote? - Who's that?

2310
01:23:43,388 --> 01:23:44,750
Who made that vote?

2311
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:46,890
A thief must have made that vote.

2312
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:49,490
I guess a thief must have made that one vote.

2313
01:23:49,494 --> 01:23:53,865
First, the one with the largest number of votes, six, is...

2314
01:23:54,799 --> 01:23:56,600
- It's Dam Bi. - I guess so.

2315
01:23:56,601 --> 01:23:57,775
(The suspects for a Boss are Haha and Dam Bi.)

2316
01:23:58,103 --> 01:24:00,945
- I'm the King. Haha is the Boss. - Same here.

2317
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:04,540
Dam Bi, please go on the platform.

2318
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:07,510
- This is crazy. - Gosh, it's crazy.

2319
01:24:07,512 --> 01:24:11,850
(Se Chan insisted that Dam Bi is a Boss.)

2320
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,210
(10 seconds before the vote closed)

2321
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:16,520
(Jae Seok wrote Haha for a Boss.)

2322
01:24:16,521 --> 01:24:19,120
(No, this is true.)

2323
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:21,050
(Dam Bi's look on her face was so bad.)

2324
01:24:21,059 --> 01:24:22,460
The look on her face was so bad.

2325
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:25,730
(Most of them insisted to trust Se Chan.)

2326
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:29,605
(They changed their mind to write Dam Bi in the end.)

2327
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:37,315
(The consensus was formed to write Dam Bi's name at last.)

2328
01:24:37,409 --> 01:24:39,710
I'm crazy

2329
01:24:39,711 --> 01:24:42,510
The one with the 2nd largest number of votes, 5, is...

2330
01:24:42,514 --> 01:24:46,655
(Who's going to stand on the platform next?)

2331
01:24:46,685 --> 01:24:53,850
(What's the thieves' choice between Seok Jin and Se Chan?)

2332
01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:55,060
Seok Jin, please go on the platform.

2333
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:59,265
(Seok Jin is chosen.)

2334
01:24:59,564 --> 01:25:00,630
Look at his face.

2335
01:25:00,632 --> 01:25:02,060
(Thieves chose Seok Jin as a suspect for the King.)

2336
01:25:02,067 --> 01:25:03,100
This is...

2337
01:25:03,101 --> 01:25:06,275
(Thieves chose Seok Jin as a suspect for the King.)

2338
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:09,940
(I hope we made a right choice.)

2339
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:14,010
Let's take off Seok Jin's name tag...

2340
01:25:14,012 --> 01:25:18,680
- and check out the result. - All right.

2341
01:25:18,683 --> 01:25:22,220
- I mean... - Let's see it first.

2342
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:25,120
- I might have goose bumps. - 1, 2...

2343
01:25:25,123 --> 01:25:27,690
(Is he a civilian who acted to deceive the thieves?)

2344
01:25:27,692 --> 01:25:33,890
(If Se Chan is the King, the thieves fail to find the King.)

2345
01:25:33,898 --> 01:25:35,300
(What's Seok Jin's identity?)

2346
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,300
three.

2347
01:25:36,301 --> 01:25:40,475
(What's Seok Jin's identity?)

2348
01:25:40,805 --> 01:25:41,800
(King)

2349
01:25:41,806 --> 01:25:45,410
(Seok Jin is the King.)

2350
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,685
I told you!

2351
01:25:47,712 --> 01:25:51,480
(Is Seok Jin, not Se Chan, a King?)

2352
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:53,510
(We caught a King.)

2353
01:25:53,518 --> 01:25:56,120
Let me join!

2354
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:58,320
Ji Hyo, I told you!

2355
01:25:58,323 --> 01:26:00,990
I told you so many times.

2356
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:02,290
(If Seok Jin is a King, what's Se Chan's identity?)

2357
01:26:02,293 --> 01:26:06,160
(Of course Se Chan is the only thief left.)

2358
01:26:06,164 --> 01:26:11,660
(In the end, Se Chan deceived everyone with his acting.)

2359
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:12,970
I did it!

2360
01:26:12,971 --> 01:26:15,600
- You made it! - You certainly did it!

2361
01:26:15,607 --> 01:26:16,640
(A hidden mission was sent before the real race started.)

2362
01:26:16,641 --> 01:26:20,670
Today, we'll do Thieves Race in Don't Trust Them.

2363
01:26:20,678 --> 01:26:24,615
You're a Boss, the leader of thieves.

2364
01:26:24,749 --> 01:26:26,155
Am I a thief?

2365
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:28,855
It was my dream when I was little.

2366
01:26:29,454 --> 01:26:32,820
I wanted to be a cool thief.

2367
01:26:32,824 --> 01:26:34,195
(The leader of thieves, a Boss, Haha)

2368
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,890
Are four of us doing something?

2369
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:39,330
We don't trust one another now.

2370
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:42,060
It's such a weak combination, four of us.

2371
01:26:42,066 --> 01:26:44,505
- All of us are so weak. - I'm so...

2372
01:26:44,636 --> 01:26:46,930
Are we special or the others are special?

2373
01:26:46,938 --> 01:26:49,545
We're special in a strange way.

2374
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:53,415
(4 weak thieves)

2375
01:26:54,179 --> 01:26:58,685
(The Boss and the thieves didn't know one another at first.)

2376
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:04,750
(They ended up meeting one another on the platform.)

2377
01:27:04,756 --> 01:27:08,390
(The second judgment was the critical moment.)

2378
01:27:08,393 --> 01:27:12,160
(Haha is the Boss.)

2379
01:27:12,163 --> 01:27:16,800
(The only unidentified thief, Se Chan, started his action.)

2380
01:27:16,801 --> 01:27:19,570
(Because I am the King.)

2381
01:27:19,571 --> 01:27:25,710
(His game changer put the civilians into a trouble.)

2382
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,610
(Your Majesty.)

2383
01:27:27,612 --> 01:27:29,685
(You must serve me.)

2384
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:33,355
(Time for the last vote)

2385
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,020
(Seok Jin)

2386
01:27:38,022 --> 01:27:39,920
(Now...)

2387
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:43,460
(Se Chan gave me a look that it's Seok Jin.)

2388
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:47,530
(Se Chan's intelligence made it possible to find Seok Jin.)

2389
01:27:47,532 --> 01:27:50,560
(I'm the King.)

2390
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:53,300
(When he received the secret instruction...)

2391
01:27:53,304 --> 01:27:56,140
Actually, if we all found Haha, we could have won the game.

2392
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:58,000
We were larger in number.

2393
01:27:58,009 --> 01:27:59,910
What's the use of it? Everyone wrote down Dam Bi's name.

2394
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:02,780
- Everyone wrote down my name. - All wrote down Dam Bi's name.

2395
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,440
- I'm pissed off. - We were such fools.

2396
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:07,210
By the way, the King was so weak.

2397
01:28:07,218 --> 01:28:10,420
- A weak king. - He's so weak.

2398
01:28:10,421 --> 01:28:13,090
For your information, I was going to go behind Jong Kook,

2399
01:28:13,091 --> 01:28:16,260
but So Min insisted she would go behind him.

2400
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:17,590
(Got caught)

2401
01:28:17,595 --> 01:28:21,290
I told her that now she even pours water on me.

2402
01:28:21,299 --> 01:28:24,030
- Then now you're going to get wet. - Okay.

2403
01:28:24,035 --> 01:28:25,200
All right.

2404
01:28:25,203 --> 01:28:26,900
(Water dropping)

2405
01:28:26,905 --> 01:28:29,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2406
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,740
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. - Don't do it little by little.

2407
01:28:31,743 --> 01:28:34,210
- Don't do it little by little. - I really didn't mean it.

2408
01:28:34,212 --> 01:28:35,815
The bucket is so full, that's why.

2409
01:28:36,714 --> 01:28:37,910
(Team Thieves won the game, so they're pouring water.)

2410
01:28:37,916 --> 01:28:39,850
Is it cold, Gook Ju? My goodness.

2411
01:28:39,851 --> 01:28:42,720
- 1, 2, 3! - Go ahead!

2412
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,290
(Pouring water)

2413
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,720
(Water bomb makes them regret.)

2414
01:28:47,725 --> 01:28:50,295
(Screaming)

2415
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:57,605
Well,

2416
01:28:57,835 --> 01:29:00,175
- Gook Ju, are you all right? - Yes.

2417
01:29:00,305 --> 01:29:01,400
You look like Undertaker.

2418
01:29:01,406 --> 01:29:04,270
(Undertaker, a professional wrestler is here all of a sudden.)

2419
01:29:04,275 --> 01:29:07,115
Now Undertaker...

2420
01:29:07,312 --> 01:29:08,810
Gook Ju.

2421
01:29:08,813 --> 01:29:11,680
Thank you for your effort, Gook Ju, Gyeong Ree,

2422
01:29:11,683 --> 01:29:13,850
- Eun Su, and Dam Bi. - Thank you for your effort!

2423
01:29:13,851 --> 01:29:15,720
This is amazing!

2424
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,920
(Thank you for your effort, Dam Bi, Eun Su, Gook Ju, and Gyeong Ree.)

2425
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:18,495
(Here we go at last.)

2426
01:29:19,991 --> 01:29:22,035
(Luxury Package, Switzerland)

2427
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,820
(The magnificent view heals you just by looking at it.)

2428
01:29:24,829 --> 01:29:28,205
(It's really luxurious!)

2429
01:29:28,466 --> 01:29:30,905
(I'm a lucky boy.)

2430
01:29:32,804 --> 01:29:35,005
(The luck doesn't last long.)

2431
01:29:35,139 --> 01:29:38,000
(Team Luxury is in a crisis.)

2432
01:29:38,009 --> 01:29:41,945
(What on earth happened to them?)

2433
01:29:42,981 --> 01:29:44,810
(The hardest mission ever is disclosed.)

2434
01:29:44,816 --> 01:29:46,255
(They arrive there at last.)

2435
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:49,025
(Shuddering Package, England)

2436
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,820
(Out of all knowledge)

2437
01:29:51,823 --> 01:29:53,890
(Incomparable)

2438
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:56,560
(Wing walking!)

2439
01:29:56,561 --> 01:29:58,990
(Forget everything you have experienced so far!)

2440
01:29:58,997 --> 01:30:01,305
(The hardest penalty ever!)

2441
01:30:01,332 --> 01:30:06,400
(The last battle for wing walking!) (The last chance for the exemption!)

2442
01:30:06,404 --> 01:30:10,445
(Who will stand on the wing?)

2443
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:12,245
(So Min, you got your booger out.)

2444
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:15,315
(A sudden journey)
