1
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:07,980
(Do you remember the Family Package Project?)

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,621
(It was the 1st global project of 2018 on Running Man.)

3
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:14,960
(Depending on their 4-week missions, their fates divided.)

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,191
(4 special members joined them on this special project.)

5
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:20,430
(And four races unfolded with these members.)

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,500
(The roulette of their fates was completed while playing dirty.)

7
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:28,140
(The Luxury Package got Switzerland. The Shuddering Package, the UK.)

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,640
(And one snap determined...)

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,670
(the different fates of the 12 members.)

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,941
(Switzerland: Jong Kook, Jin Young, Haha, Ji Hyo, Se Chan, and Han Na)

11
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,141
(UK: Jae Seok, So Min, Sang Yeob, Seok Jin, Da Hee, and Kwang Soo)

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,651
(And at last,)

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,611
(6 members of the Luxury Package went to Zermatt, Switzerland.)

14
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:42,151
(But was there more to this luxurious trip?)

15
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:44,821
(5 members of the Shuddering Package went to wing walk with heavy feet.)

16
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,321
(What on earth happened to them?)

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,860
(June 9, the day of the Luxury Package members' departure)

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,689
- Hello. - Are you all ready?

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,630
- I can't. - You can't ski? It's all set up.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,729
No, I can't.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,069
- Jong Kook can teach you. - The story is all set up.

22
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:01,069
- Jong Kook, I like the members. - Goodness.

23
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:05,810
- My goodness. - No one pulls absurd stunts here.

24
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,810
- I like this group. - The group is fun to have fun with.

25
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,339
Jong Kook, without you, everyone will pull ridiculous stunts.

26
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:11,510
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

27
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,720
- They're a group of jokers. - Ridiculous stunts...

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,850
- I warned them in advance. - You did?

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,949
- Jong Kook said this to me. - I told her not to be ambitious.

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,390
"Jin Young, don't be ambitious to get a lot of airtime."

31
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,159
- "Let's take this easy." - Right.

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,820
- "The scenery will be great." - Exactly.

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,029
- They promised to kiss... - Hey, they have to air...

34
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,529
- on the Alps. - No, listen.

35
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:28,529
(She adds a spoonful of a ridiculous story.)

36
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:32,430
No, listen. The natural landscape is too pretty not to air on TV.

37
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,140
We won't be on TV longer because we desperately try harder.

38
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,540
- You're desperately trying now. - No, that's not true.

39
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,239
- Jong Kook. - It's already started. It began.

40
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:42,610
- I ask because I'm curious. - This is so weird.

41
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,040
How many black outfits...

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,680
(Do you like me or something?)

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,979
- What? - Do you keep buying them?

44
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:51,789
- This is a misunderstanding. - I get that it is.

45
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,489
Don't get the wrong idea. I always liked black.

46
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,119
- You always liked black? - Yes, I did.

47
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,129
- I'll research your past clips. - I can't...

48
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,530
- Look into every clip. - I can't stand next to them.

49
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,129
- We can never stay together. - I'm getting a headache.

50
00:02:03,129 --> 00:02:05,730
- I suddenly have a headache. - Come here. It's not balanced.

51
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,330
- Look at him. - He was thinking about me.

52
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,840
- You matched yours to mine. - Right.

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,700
I wanted to have an easy time during those five days.

54
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,640
Why do you always rebel against me when you're not with me?

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,409
- Rebel? What do you mean? - You do when I'm not with you.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,750
When I rebel against you in your presence, you'll hit me.

57
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,649
(Do you need to ask?)

58
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,349
- If I do, you'd hit me. - When I'm not with you,

59
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,050
you do that. That's why people get the wrong idea. I don't hit people.

60
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,019
I didn't know Jong Kook watched our shows.

61
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,390
- That's how he is. - It's the final episode of...

62
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,230
the Family Package Project. We'll depart for Switzerland today.

63
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,429
(They'll head to Switzerland.)

64
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,970
- Let's go! Let's go! - I didn't know I'd be on this trip.

65
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,300
- It was hard filming all the shows. - Right.

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,700
- We need to relax. We ought to. - It will be paradise.

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,440
Zermatt, which you will be heading to, is chosen...

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,509
as 1 of the 50 destinations to visit before you die.

69
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,580
It was ranked first as the place to visit by the Swiss if...

70
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,080
- they could visit only one place. - Really?

71
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,989
In Zermatt, you will be skiing during summer.

72
00:02:59,149 --> 00:03:01,790
- That had been my dream. - Skiing during summer.

73
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,489
- How is it possible during summer? - I can't believe this.

74
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,529
- You'll have cheese fondue. - Cheese fondue.

75
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,330
- Fondue. - You'll sleep at the hotel...

76
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,200
with the highest observatory in Europe.

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
(This is their 3rd stop on their itinerary.)

78
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,399
(Really? This is amazing!)

79
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,939
This is my dream.

80
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,040
- You didn't know about that. - What? No, I did.

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,239
- You knew about the observatory? - No, I didn't.

82
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,380
- Gosh. They look like... - Then what dream?

83
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:28,019
- You two look like a couple. - Isn't that right?

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,420
You definitely didn't know about it. Stop forcing those reactions.

85
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:34,149
His hand feels awkward. It's hard to let his hand rest on my shoulder.

86
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:35,459
- Right? - Why?

87
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,929
And the theme of the Luxury Package is...

88
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:41,929
- Do Everything You Want to Do. - This is insane.

89
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,529
(Do Everything You Want to Do)

90
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,469
You can add activities you'd like to do to the itinerary.

91
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,540
You will be able to do every activity you choose.

92
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,839
(We will let you do every activity you choose.)

93
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,739
- You. You'll be a famous director. - We can use SBS' budget?

94
00:03:57,809 --> 00:03:58,950
Please bring in the board.

95
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,209
(The itinerary is beyond luxurious.)

96
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,550
- There are a lot. - We must visit there.

97
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,820
- Gosh. - Look at all the food.

98
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:06,450
- Look at that. - The veal sausages look good.

99
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,589
- Yes, they look delicious. - Skiing there would be awesome.

100
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,790
- How many can we choose? - As many as you want.

101
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,330
You can discuss among yourselves and choose as many as you want.

102
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,830
- This is incredible. - To be honest...

103
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:18,399
You know this Heli-skiing?

104
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,540
(They can get off the helicopter anywhere and ski on the Alps.)

105
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,610
(During this activity of the nature, they can ski at 4,000m altitude.)

106
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:30,640
- My gosh, that's my dream. - I went there 20 years ago.

107
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,610
- You did? Did you ski there? - I stayed there for two weeks.

108
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,779
- No, I didn't have enough money. - Really?

109
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,719
- Seriously? - It's expensive.

110
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,189
To those who enjoy skiing or snowboarding,

111
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:40,390
it's a dream.

112
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,760
It used to be my dream.

113
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,219
Jin Young can't ski.

114
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:44,760
(Jin Young can't ski.)

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,760
Jong Kook, you can carry her in your arms, right?

116
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,230
- Carry her on your back. - Carry her on your back.

117
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,399
I am telling you.

118
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,130
I can tie her to my waist.

119
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:53,670
Fine. Go ahead and choose that option.

120
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,269
Look. It's not like you are completely disinterested, JK.

121
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,410
(Look. It's not like you are completely disinterested, JK.)

122
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,469
- JK. - JK.

123
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,280
- JK. - Stop calling me JK.

124
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,480
(JK is a cute nickname.)

125
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,020
Let's choose heli-skiing.

126
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,520
- I agree. We have to try it. - We have to try it.

127
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,449
- Let's try heli-skiing. - Look at that.

128
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,189
How about this one?

129
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,160
- Paragliding. - How about paragliding?

130
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,619
Paragliding.

131
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,290
- Let's go look at the sheep. - I know. This is so cute.

132
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:20,460
You know,

133
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,160
we can see sheep in Korea.

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,730
- Let's go see them. - These sheep have black faces.

135
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,199
You can paint the Korean ones.

136
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,239
Let's go over to this side.

137
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:31,210
It's time to choose the food.

138
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,610
- The Michelin Guide. - This one.

139
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,509
- Mediterranean cuisine. - It looks delicious.

140
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:35,679
- It looks delicious. Look at it. - Mediterranean cuisine.

141
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,079
What's Mediterranean cuisine?

142
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,650
It's a cuisine of the Mediterranean Sea.

143
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,809
- What does that mean? - East, Yellow, or Mediterranean.

144
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,249
The sea that is close to Switzerland is Mediterranean Sea.

145
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:43,720
East, Yellow, or Mediterranean Sea.

146
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,220
It must be expensive.

147
00:05:45,249 --> 00:05:46,989
- It's the best. - It's luxurious.

148
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,689
Jin Young, this one is for you.

149
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,189
Stargazing at an observatory.

150
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:51,290
(Stargaze at an observatory with JK.)

151
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,460
- We can stargaze anywhere. - That star is your star

152
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,199
That star is my star

153
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,100
(They are ridiculous.)

154
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,400
When you sang those words, his heart fluttered.

155
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:03,999
- JK's heart fluttered. - JK.

156
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,110
It's not like you are completely disinterested, JK.

157
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,780
Did she order you to do this?

158
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:11,949
- Maybe the production crew did. - I got paid.

159
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,179
Did you get paid?

160
00:06:13,179 --> 00:06:14,480
I got paid by Jin Young.

161
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
You are pretty funny.

162
00:06:16,179 --> 00:06:17,619
Let's do it.

163
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:19,090
- Sure. - Let's stargaze at an observatory.

164
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,420
You chose the tours.

165
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,559
Now, I will give you the real rules of the Luxury Package tour.

166
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,600
- Are there rules? - Real rules?

167
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,829
Gosh, you are being annoying again.

168
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:34,999
Luxury Package shouldn't have any rules.

169
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,499
During the duration of your trip,

170
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:41,210
you have to finish the chosen tours to return to Korea.

171
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,379
As for the additional tours you have chosen,

172
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,679
you will pay the expenses.

173
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,179
You will pay the expenses.

174
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:53,819
- That's just wrong. - Don't be like that.

175
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,590
- Don't be like that. - That lying...

176
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,090
Heli-skiing is expensive.

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
It will cost thousands of dollars.

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,030
You should have listened to women.

179
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,730
- We suggested looking at the sheep. - We suggested looking at the sheep.

180
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,069
Seriously.

181
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,199
The black-faced sheep.

182
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,139
The flights, hotels,

183
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,439
and the basics will be paid by the production crew.

184
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,170
Isn't this robbery?

185
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,939
- Isn't this robbery? - This is extortion.

186
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:18,550
They are basically telling us to pay for this trip.

187
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,619
- We can't do this. - This restaurant must be expensive.

188
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:23,179
It must cost 300 dollars per person to eat there.

189
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:25,150
Who pays for the additional tours...

190
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,860
will be decided by a vote and Half and Half Roulette.

191
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,489
(A vote and Half and Half Roulette)

192
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,699
- This is worse. - Don't spin the roulette.

193
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,759
Firstly,

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,069
you will have a secret vote per each tour.

195
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,239
After enjoying the tour, the ballot box will be opened.

196
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,300
The members whose names are in it...

197
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,170
will get written on the roulette instead of the production crew.

198
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,879
Then the one person who gets chosen will pay.

199
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,009
The production crew might get chosen too.

200
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,379
Our names are bound to show up in the ballot box.

201
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:57,179
- This is scary. - If no one writes the name,

202
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,150
the chance is half and half between the members and the crew.

203
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,619
We will have a chance if we join forces.

204
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:02,989
- That's right. - We will have a chance.

205
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:06,160
I already see three traitors.

206
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,329
No, no.

207
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,259
- I won't write anyone's name. - I am conscientious.

208
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,869
- You are bound to backstab us. - I don't do that around Jong Kook.

209
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:14,340
I won't... I won't write anyone's name.

210
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,699
Sure.

211
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:16,999
Before you return to Korea,

212
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,639
there will be the Last Refund Chance for those who paid for the tours.

213
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,540
Last Refund Chance?

214
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,850
Please bring in the board.

215
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,050
Can we get our money back?

216
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,509
We become thankful of such chances.

217
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,150
Can we get a refund?

218
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,949
- Hey, hey. - What is this?

219
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,249
Can we get a refund?

220
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,020
(What?)

221
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,730
(What are these?)

222
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,559
I got goosebumps as soon as I saw the board.

223
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,329
Okay, I will get a refund.

224
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
- What is "a refund"? - You get your money back.

225
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,069
(You can't beat Se Chan's naivete.)

226
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,270
You get your money back.

227
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,270
You remember these, right?

228
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,040
These are the three activities for the Shuddering Package.

229
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,210
(3 activities for the Shuddering Package)

230
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,910
(Cable car bungee jumping from the height of 134m)

231
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,650
(A form of triathlon at a rough canyon, canyoning)

232
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,960
(The longest suspension bridge that is 494m long and 85m high)

233
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,389
These are the three activities for the Shuddering Package.

234
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,900
If you try one of the activities,

235
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:18,270
you will get a full refund.

236
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,740
(If they try one of the activities, they get a full refund.)

237
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,170
These activities are really scary.

238
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,439
I can't bungee jump.

239
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,469
I am going to lie down on the bed...

240
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,140
upon arrival.

241
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:31,880
This isn't the Luxury Package.

242
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,750
Let's promise not to vote for each other...

243
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,650
- before we worry about these. - That's right.

244
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,679
- Seriously. - That's right.

245
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,920
Let's use the production crew's money.

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,990
That's right.

247
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,089
The least we can do is say that we'll do so.

248
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:42,089
(He has zero trust in them.)

249
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,120
In any case, this is nice. The members are nice as well.

250
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,160
This is nice.

251
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,589
- Let's go. - Let's go.

252
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,500
(Let's see if their friendship lasts.)

253
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:49,929
Let's film a video.

254
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:52,069
- We are going to Switzerland. - We are going to Switzerland.

255
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,829
This is lovely.

256
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,339
My goodness, you aren't wearing any makeup.

257
00:09:57,339 --> 00:09:59,209
This is a celebrity's bare face.

258
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,640
- Look at Ji Hyo's face. - Since I have to sleep,

259
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,079
I washed my face and got ready to go to bed.

260
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,709
- Are you going to Switzerland? - Yes.

261
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,520
How luxurious!

262
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
We will have...

263
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,520
- the Luxury Package in Switzerland. - Let's go.

264
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:14,920
- Fondue. - Fondue.

265
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:18,559
- Switzerland. - We are going there.

266
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:21,559
- What is this? - A sheet mask.

267
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,300
Is this you?

268
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,229
(Ji Hyo puts on a sheet mask as soon as she boards the plane.)

269
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:27,670
You put this on your face.

270
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,699
Like that?

271
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,969
- You put this on your face. - Then you sleep.

272
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,809
(Se Chan begins to take care of his skin.)

273
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:34,309
- Look at this. - What is that?

274
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:37,280
- It's Ji Hyo's sheet mask. - Really?

275
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:38,709
- I want to try it. - Try it.

276
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,550
(We are handsome men.)

277
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,319
(It's time for them to fall asleep.)

278
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:51,859
(Drawing)

279
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,530
(I am done.)

280
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,140
(He is satisfied.)

281
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,740
(The three sisters are busy chatting.)

282
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,640
(He glances at them.)

283
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,150
(Haha finds his childhood innocence and approaches Ji Hyo.)

284
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,349
(He gives her the packet he scribbled on.)

285
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,280
It's nice.

286
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,959
(Excited to hear him compliment on her product,)

287
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,890
(she takes a picture with the packet he scribbled on.)

288
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,490
(My mission is complete.)

289
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,260
(About 10 minutes pass.)

290
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,429
(For goodness' sake.)

291
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,569
What is this?

292
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,900
(Flustered)

293
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:38,870
(For goodness' sake.)

294
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:41,410
What is this?

295
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,410
(Let's see how the immature Team Luxury fares.)

296
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,979
I feel like we are going to a battlefield.

297
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,250
I feel horrible.

298
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,250
- Hello. - For goodness' sake.

299
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:55,020
- Hello. - It's not fun to be at the airport.

300
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,760
I have never felt good...

301
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,030
about going to the airport while shooting Running Man.

302
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,829
Look at Kwang Soo's face.

303
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:03,729
- He is about to drop dead. - I got an IV injection yesterday.

304
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,929
He looks like he is headed for the netherworld.

305
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:07,199
I was surprised to see his face.

306
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:10,000
You know, it has been a while...

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,410
- since we saw Da Hee. - It has been a while.

308
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,410
- She became prettier. - That's right.

309
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,439
She became more stylish.

310
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,079
The hat changed her looks.

311
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,520
Kwang Soo, why didn't you finish tucking in your shirt?

312
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,920
- No, this is... - What is this?

313
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,250
What are you pointing at?

314
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,420
(Watch where you point.)

315
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,819
What are you doing?

316
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,359
The two of you should be apart from each other.

317
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,329
Gosh, you always stay close and bicker.

318
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:36,199
- He is very sensitive today. - I know.

319
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:38,130
- He is sensitive. - Did you miss Da Hee?

320
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,170
That came out of nowhere.

321
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,370
- Maybe you missed Da Hee. - To be honest,

322
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,569
- I thought about contacting Da Hee. - Why didn't you?

323
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:48,309
- She might have misunderstood. - I asked him yesterday,

324
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:51,650
and he said that she might think he is making a move on her.

325
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,420
I realized that I would be annoyed...

326
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,579
whether she misunderstands or not.

327
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,290
That's why I didn't contact her.

328
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,250
Good job.

329
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,859
Did you gain weight?

330
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:03,459
- What? - Did you gain weight?

331
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:05,329
You can't wing walk if you weigh over 78kg.

332
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,829
I ate a lot these days,

333
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,199
but there is only so much weight you can gain.

334
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,500
I gained weight up to 77kg.

335
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,540
- You just needed to go a bit more. - 1kg.

336
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,270
Then I suddenly had...

337
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,370
- You had a struggle. - I had a struggle...

338
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,069
and ended up losing 5kg.

339
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,079
Now, I weigh 72kg.

340
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,179
- You just needed to gain 3kg. - I know.

341
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,250
I won't be able to wing walk...

342
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,880
- if there is a weight restriction. - You can't do it if you weigh 80kg.

343
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,990
I weigh 80kg.

344
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,559
(I weigh 80kg.)

345
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,760
Really?

346
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,359
- Do you weigh 80kg? - Do you weigh 80kg?

347
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,189
Why is no one telling her to stop lying?

348
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,199
(There is no way she weighs that much.)

349
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,959
Why does everyone think it's plausible?

350
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,729
- I thought it might be plausible. - You know, Da Hee is...

351
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:47,839
- No one's saying anything. - She's tall.

352
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,400
- Da Hee is very tall. - I'm tall.

353
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,839
How much do you weigh?

354
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,740
- I weigh 70kg. - You don't weigh a lot.

355
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,309
Sang Yeob wants to be a regular member of Running Man.

356
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,280
He is very ambitious.

357
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,920
He says...

358
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,250
he can do anything...

359
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,319
the production crew asks.

360
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,420
I always tell the production crew...

361
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,990
that I can come fully dressed up...

362
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,559
if they tell me an hour ahead.

363
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,559
(I can come fully dressed up if they tell me an hour ahead.)

364
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,630
(He is a prepared man.)

365
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:19,500
In the beginning, the production crew liked that.

366
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,069
Now, they find it burdensome.

367
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,670
You are too enthusiastic.

368
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,370
When you got out of the car, the staff went,

369
00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:25,910
"What is wrong with him?"

370
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:27,780
(It's fun to slander.)

371
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,050
For the finale of the Running Man Family Package Project,

372
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,910
you will leave for the UK for the Shuddering Package.

373
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,380
(It's the day they leave for the UK for the Shuddering Package.)

374
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:38,449
(It's finally here.)

375
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,290
(Wing walking, an unprecedented and extreme experience)

376
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,359
(It starts now.)

377
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:47,390
How do you feel?

378
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,500
(How do you feel about going to the UK?)

379
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,469
We just talked about it.

380
00:14:51,469 --> 00:14:53,370
- We've been talking about... - What do you mean?

381
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,939
- how we felt for 30 minutes. - Talk about how we feel?

382
00:14:54,939 --> 00:14:56,540
Do I have to curse again?

383
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,040
(Are you teasing us?)

384
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,410
All of you got quite sensitive.

385
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:05,079
As you're about to travel far,

386
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:07,280
- there are two gifts for you. - Gifts?

387
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,349
(Two special gifts)

388
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,819
Let's open the first gift box.

389
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:13,050
They're real gifts.

390
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,620
Who prepared it?

391
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,319
(It's the first gift.)

392
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,229
- What are they? - What are they?

393
00:15:19,229 --> 00:15:22,400
(Special Pirate Roulette Game made from clay)

394
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,760
Look at the characters.

395
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
It's Pirate Roulette Game.

396
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,770
A Running Man fan sent Pirate Roulette Games...

397
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,800
- that she made with a letter. - She made them herself?

398
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,500
- Herself? - Really?

399
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,969
- It's Seok Jin. - This is me.

400
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:33,469
- It's Seok Jin. - It is.

401
00:15:33,469 --> 00:15:35,410
"To Running Man members,"

402
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,479
"I'm a huge fan of Running Man. I'm Cho Yeon Woo."

403
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,280
"I've been watching the show since I was 12."

404
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,120
"It's been 8 years, and I'm 20."

405
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,780
- Really? - That's cute.

406
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,120
"When I was in middle school, I made name tags..."

407
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,520
"to play Name Tag Elimination."

408
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,089
"You work very hard."

409
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,929
"You often play Pirate Roulette Game these days,"

410
00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:53,490
"so I made Running Man characters with clay."

411
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,599
"I planned to make Grasshopper Jae Seok and Penguin Haha."

412
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:59,429
"However, I ran out of clay, so I made an impala."

413
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:00,530
(However, I ran out of clay, so I made an impala.)

414
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,339
(It's an unexpected impala.)

415
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,109
To make the penguin,

416
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,140
it requires more clay.

417
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,550
I was very happy at first.

418
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,109
He had no choice.

419
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:15,179
- I can understand. - He had no choice.

420
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,319
He still made it, so I'm thankful.

421
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,059
"P.S. Se Chan and So Min who joined recently are great."

422
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,859
"Sincerely, your big fan, Yeon Woo"

423
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,660
- Thank you. - Thank you, Yeon Woo.

424
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,630
- We'd like to thank Yeon Woo again. - We thank you.

425
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,630
She made them so well.

426
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:31,900
Is this another gift?

427
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,199
Open them at the same time.

428
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,400
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

429
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:36,640
- 3. - 3.

430
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,510
- What is it? - It's a grasshopper and a frog.

431
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,770
- It's a frog. - It's a frog.

432
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,109
So Min.

433
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,839
- It's a frog. - Did another fan make them?

434
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,809
(So Min loves it.)

435
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,050
It's so cute.

436
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,109
It's a frog.

437
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,780
- "I love you, I'm sorry, thanks." - "I love you, I'm sorry, thanks.

438
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,990
"Hello, I'm Luxurious Yang Se Chan."

439
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,689
- What? - How's the weather in the UK?

440
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
"The weather is perfect for wing walking."

441
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,400
"If I had gone there, I'd ride it for you. It's unfortunate."

442
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,929
"Be safe and enjoy the ride."

443
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,929
"Luxurious Se Chan."

444
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,599
(Se Chan is such a brat.)

445
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,870
(Wait until we come back.)

446
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:10,939
Yang Se Chan.

447
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,510
There's one more thing.

448
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,439
Sang Yeob and Da Hee haven't signed the oath yet.

449
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,949
Please sign the oath.

450
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:18,979
(It's time to sign the oath.)

451
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,150
Please read the oath...

452
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,219
and sign it.

453
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,790
- Write in English. - Write it in capital letters.

454
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,420
Wait, is this what I write?

455
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:33,329
Sang Yeob is prepared for the ride.

456
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,199
You weigh 70kg, which is perfect.

457
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:36,829
It's perfect.

458
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,099
Do we just sign here?

459
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,699
She weighs less than I do.

460
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,240
- What? - Stop lying.

461
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,270
I'm not.

462
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,370
- Do you weigh 52kg? - Yes.

463
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,540
You only weigh that much?

464
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,910
- She weighs 53kg. - She's lean.

465
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,209
No, I don't.

466
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,750
- You wrote 53kg. - Aren't you in the 40s range?

467
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,950
So Min weighs 53kg.

468
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,879
Da Hee sounded very mean.

469
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,319
Really?

470
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,419
Listen to Da Hee.

471
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:02,220
There's no point in lying. You'll be weighed before the ride.

472
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,419
It's better to be honest.

473
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,030
- Will we be weighed? - Yes.

474
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,089
It's for safety reasons.

475
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,159
(She changes her number.)

476
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,800
Are you changing the 10th digit?

477
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,399
You don't have to ride it then.

478
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,369
You can be exempt.

479
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,599
Stop it.

480
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:15,099
Why are you erasing it?

481
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,899
- She erased it several times. - Why are you erasing it?

482
00:18:16,899 --> 00:18:19,470
- What are you doing, Da Hee? - Do you weigh 56kg?

483
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:22,139
- I was... - Just write 60kg to be safe.

484
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:23,180
(Her final weight is 56kg.)

485
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,010
Before you travel to the UK,

486
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,180
- we have bad news for you. - What is it?

487
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,649
Wing walking ride operates a limited number of times...

488
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:32,919
per day.

489
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:33,919
(There's a limit to wing walking rides.)

490
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,220
Among you...

491
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,389
(The number of rides is limited.)

492
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:42,399
- only three will ride it. - Okay.

493
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,569
(Only 3 members will wing walk.)

494
00:18:45,569 --> 00:18:47,000
- That's unfortunate. - That's half of us.

495
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,270
- That's half of us. - Okay.

496
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,470
- We have a 50-percent chance. - Okay.

497
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,270
This is what we prepared for Shuddering Package in the UK.

498
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,210
It's called Unlucky of the Unlucky. Here are the rules.

499
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,280
(Unlucky of the Unlucky)

500
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,809
It's a total of four rounds.

501
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:03,919
Penalty badges will be distributed based on the results.

502
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,250
We have badges today.

503
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,790
Based on the number of penalty badges,

504
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,819
the size of Pirate Roulette at the final race will change.

505
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:11,859
(Pirate Roulette size changes.)

506
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,629
The 1st and 2nd place get 24 slots.

507
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:15,200
The 3rd and 4th place get 16 slots.

508
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,970
The 5th and 6th place get 8 slots in Pirate Roulette Game.

509
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,139
You play in the order of the last to first.

510
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:22,470
(The game is played in the order of the last to first.)

511
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,770
The 1st 3 losers get on the wing walking ride.

512
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,139
(The 1st 3 losers get on the wing walking ride.)

513
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:30,339
(You're at a disadvantage the more badges you have.)

514
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:31,480
Kwang Soo.

515
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:34,579
It doesn't matter whether you're first or last place.

516
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,980
It doesn't matter whether you're first or last place.

517
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:39,250
Even if you get 100 slots in Pirate Roulette Game,

518
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:41,690
- The pirate will pop. - you always lose.

519
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,889
- I was startled by him. - He always loses.

520
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,559
Even our trip to the UK is worrisome.

521
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:49,800
Here's the mission to determine the ranking.

522
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,470
It's called Hard Suitcase.

523
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,629
(Hard Suitcase)

524
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,669
- Each of you brought a suitcase. - Yes.

525
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:58,369
Do you see a line of white tape?

526
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,970
That's the starting line.

527
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,980
Push your suitcase to the line. The ranking will be determined...

528
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,450
by how close your suitcase gets to the line.

529
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,020
(The last three receive penalty badges.)

530
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,349
- It's similar to curling. - Of course.

531
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:12,349
Okay.

532
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,119
- Seok Jin will start. - Okay.

533
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,559
- Do we only get one chance? - That's right.

534
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,230
(Seok Jin, Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, So Min, Sang Yeob, and Da Hee)

535
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,589
The penalty is the penalty badge.

536
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,700
(You get a badge when your suitcase is the farthest from the line.)

537
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,230
- That's good. - He did well.

538
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,669
(Pushing)

539
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,169
(Sliding)

540
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,639
(Where will Seok Jin's suitcase stop?)

541
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,280
Don't go farther.

542
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:37,849
It went far.

543
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,109
(It's hard to tell whether it's close or far.)

544
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,680
- That's not bad. - It's considered good.

545
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,250
If you push it toward the corner, it'll be closer than Seok Jin's.

546
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,250
- You're right. - Right?

547
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,919
- Here's what I will do. - Okay, Sang Yeob.

548
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,089
I'll push mine toward Seok Jin's and move it farther.

549
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,960
- Okay. - Here I go.

550
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,089
- That's right. - It's not as easy as you think.

551
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,829
- Let's go. - The direction is good.

552
00:20:55,829 --> 00:20:57,770
- That's good. - It's turning.

553
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,770
Let's go.

554
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:00,829
(Sliding)

555
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:02,470
(It's turning.)

556
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,669
(It's closer to the line than Seok Jin's.)

557
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:05,770
- He did well. - That's good.

558
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,839
(He's in a daze.)

559
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,109
That's good.

560
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,109
(Sang Yeob is in 1st place.)

561
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:11,180
Good job.

562
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,210
(That was a good strategy.)

563
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:13,780
- Next is So Min. - This is how it starts.

564
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,079
Next is So Min.

565
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,319
I bet she won't do well.

566
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,490
- Her suitcase will get on the line. - She won't do well.

567
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,690
(How will So Min do?)

568
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,760
That was too weak. You're last.

569
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,930
(Sliding slowly)

570
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,559
(That was too weak. You're last.)

571
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,159
- So Min is last. - You made it turn back.

572
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,300
(She does a horrible job as everyone expected.)

573
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,569
- So Min and I are similar. - Her suitcase turned back.

574
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:33,829
We're bad at serious games.

575
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:35,669
- She's at a disadvantage. - She's good at practice games.

576
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,970
(She's only good at practicing.)

577
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,770
- I feel too pressured. - That's good.

578
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,510
The suitcase moved like a boomerang.

579
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,079
(Current ranking is Sang Yeob, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

580
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,480
- Move forward. - What is he doing?

581
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,010
- He's concentrating. - Move forward.

582
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,750
(Jae Seok is bad at serious games. He's the fourth player.)

583
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,720
(How far will his suitcase go?)

584
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
- It's going well. - Don't push mine away.

585
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,930
It passed mine. It went far.

586
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,430
(His suitcase stops far from the line.)

587
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,500
Oh, no.

588
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,599
I'm second place.

589
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,000
Jae Seok is last.

590
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,030
(Currently, he's last place.)

591
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,470
My goodness.

592
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,500
He's so bad at playing games.

593
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,109
Next is Kwang Soo.

594
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,139
(Current ranking is Sang Yeob, Seok Jin, So Min, and Jae Seok.)

595
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:18,109
(Okay, I got this.)

596
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:24,050
(Where will Kwang Soo's suitcase go?)

597
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,389
It's not moving as much as I thought.

598
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:27,450
- It's moving. - It's not bad.

599
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:32,930
(Sliding)

600
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,629
It's moving.

601
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:35,829
- It's going far. - Wait.

602
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:37,059
(It passes the line.)

603
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,430
- Wait. - It's moving.

604
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,470
- What? - It's moving.

605
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,139
(Sliding)

606
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:43,399
(It moves out of range.)

607
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:45,540
- Where is it going? - It's out.

608
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,609
It's out.

609
00:22:46,609 --> 00:22:48,579
- What happened? - It's out.

610
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:49,579
- What? - It's out.

611
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:51,210
- This is considered out. - How?

612
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,710
- It's out. - It's on the line.

613
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,950
- It's not a line. - It's on the line.

614
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,280
The line stops here.

615
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,750
- It's on the line. - It stops here.

616
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:58,520
- It's up to the camera. - Here's the line.

617
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,990
- It's up to the camera. - What?

618
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,990
- I'll move the camera. - Come back to your senses.

619
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,819
- What do you mean? - It's up to the camera.

620
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,460
- What senses? - The line ends at the camera.

621
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,159
- That's nonsense. - It's on the line.

622
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,169
Listen, your suitcase even passed the lighting.

623
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,169
What's the purpose of the lighting?

624
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,669
We're filming up to here.

625
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm important, not the lighting.

626
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,839
Ask the lighting director.

627
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,909
Listen, sir.

628
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:23,040
- You placed the lighting here... - Can't you move it?

629
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,180
because you didn't intend to film beyond this point, right?

630
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,480
- Right. - See?

631
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,879
Where does the framework end for the camera?

632
00:23:31,089 --> 00:23:32,889
- In front of the camera. - "In front of the camera".

633
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:35,089
(The film framework is up to where the camera is.)

634
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,990
- It's out. - What's wrong with him?

635
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,629
- Stop it. - What are you doing?

636
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,700
He's very experienced.

637
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,230
How long have you been a director?

638
00:23:43,329 --> 00:23:45,270
- It's been 10 years. - 10 years? See?

639
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,369
He has 10 years of experience.

640
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:47,599
He's worked longer than you.

641
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,000
- I've worked for 10 years. - Stop lying.

642
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,040
The first time I saw you was five years ago.

643
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,809
- Five years? - What are you talking about?

644
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,839
- It's my 9th year on Running Man. - What?

645
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,780
- Was I a ghost for four years? - I don't know.

646
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,309
I met you five years ago.

647
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:02,180
Stop it, Kwang Soo.

648
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,379
(It's Kwang Soo's fault.)

649
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,690
Does Kwang Soo get another chance, or is he disqualified?

650
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,450
He's disqualified.

651
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,460
"Disqualified"?

652
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:10,559
How am I disqualified?

653
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:13,059
He's disqualified.

654
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:15,629
You placed last.

655
00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:16,960
Ask the lighting director.

656
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,369
- Do you think he disqualified? - Please, sir.

657
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,599
Does he get to play, or is he disqualified?

658
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,569
(Director, does he play again or is he disqualified?)

659
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:24,569
Please, sir.

660
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,139
- He's disqualified. - Okay.

661
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:27,780
(He answers right away.)

662
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,210
What is he?

663
00:24:30,309 --> 00:24:32,010
(Is he a referee for the World Cup?)

664
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,349
Okay, just wait and see.

665
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,180
Are you really going to be this harsh? Okay.

666
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,359
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

667
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,919
(It's the last player, Da Hee's turn.)

668
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:45,930
- I'll push Sang Yeob's away. - What's wrong with you?

669
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,200
- Good. - I'll push Sang Yeob's away.

670
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,500
Da Hee, push it away. Or push Seok Jin's away.

671
00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:55,099
I know how to make it turn.

672
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,540
Are you a good pool player?

673
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,309
(Yes, I'm Da Hee, a pool player.)

674
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:01,379
I mean...

675
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,680
(The dark horse pushes her suitcase.)

676
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Unbelievable.

677
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,010
(Grinning)

678
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,290
(It approaches the suitcase in the best spot.)

679
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,990
- Go. - It's going out.

680
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,290
My goodness.

681
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,359
- She's disqualified! - She's disqualified!

682
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,930
- It's going out. - My goodness.

683
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,500
(Her true skills are revealed.)

684
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
(Why did it end up next to Kwang Soo's?)

685
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,569
- You're out! - Red card!

686
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:28,200
- Red card! - Hey.

687
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,169
I'm not out.

688
00:25:30,339 --> 00:25:32,309
- I think these two will lose. - They ended up next to each other.

689
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,710
I think you two will end up wing-walking.

690
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,980
- How could this happen? - I almost hit...

691
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,309
- I was right on the line. - Sang Yeob's.

692
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,480
Mine was already out, and she pushed it away.

693
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,220
Yours attracted Da Hee's like a magnet.

694
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:45,020
(Kwang Soo has 3 badges, Da Hee 2, and Jae Seok 1.)

695
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,960
You already have three badges? You'll definitely lose.

696
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,530
Even if I have to wing walk, I'll make sure Jae Seok does it too.

697
00:25:51,829 --> 00:25:53,930
I don't know what kinds of games we'll be playing,

698
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,000
but I'll make sure you end up on the wing...

699
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,169
by all means.

700
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,069
By all means.

701
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,839
- Let's get it! - Let's go!

702
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,909
(Kwang Soo has 3 badges, Da Hee 2, and Jae Seok 1.)

703
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,369
I feel a bit relieved now.

704
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,510
Kwang Soo, you already have so many badges.

705
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,349
Jae Seok, I just realized...

706
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,250
which path I should take in the UK.

707
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,220
The only path you can take leads to wing walking.

708
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,760
And seeing ghosts.

709
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,930
No. I think you're on the same path as me.

710
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,230
(Let's see.)

711
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,500
(After 12 hours of flight, they arrive in the UK.)

712
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,710
- We're in the UK. Thank you. - Take the flowers.

713
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,480
Thank you. They knew we were coming.

714
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,180
They've been waiting for us?

715
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,619
We often hear words of concern from our fans at airports.

716
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,649
- A fan just said, "Don't pass out." - What did she say?

717
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:54,720
- Really? - Yes.

718
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,220
(Don't pass out while wing walking.)

719
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,460
We might.

720
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,129
Why can't you just let us enjoy our trip?

721
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:02,760
(Gloomy)

722
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,500
I hate when Seok Jin does this.

723
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,639
You heard what Seok Jin said on the flight, right?

724
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:10,800
- What did I say? - "Guys."

725
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,210
- "There's no way I'll wing walk." - "No matter what you guys say."

726
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,940
And on camera, he says,

727
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,010
"I'm nervous to death."

728
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,010
(He changes his attitude.)

729
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,349
What are you doing?

730
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,389
I think the UK is the right place for me.

731
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:27,020
- The air is so nice here. - You said that in Mongolia too.

732
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,559
They're smoking right there. What are you talking about?

733
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:32,730
(They're smoking right there. What are you talking about?)

734
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,300
(It's a smoking area.)

735
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,869
We're walking right past a smoking area.

736
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,470
- What are you talking about? - Did you hear what he said?

737
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,809
"I have no idea where I am right now."

738
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,809
- "Am I in Sangam?" - I did say that.

739
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,950
- Everyone. - Yes.

740
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,349
We're in London now.

741
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,520
London.

742
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:02,460
We were welcomed by so many fans.

743
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,559
We appreciate it.

744
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,690
- Thank you. - Thank you.

745
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,460
- Thank you. - Thank you.

746
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,030
(We love Running Man.)

747
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,930
(I'm so popular.)

748
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,930
Thank you.

749
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,440
(Thank you.)

750
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,609
- Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo - Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo

751
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,379
- Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo - Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo

752
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,510
(Sad versus happy)

753
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,750
- Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo - Lee Kwang Soo, Lee Kwang Soo

754
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,619
(Thank you.)

755
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,280
- Lee Kwang Soo - Not Jee Seok Jin?

756
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:33,520
We're in London now.

757
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,059
The wing walking place...

758
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,329
and the ghost castle is in Oxford.

759
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:42,460
We'll go there by car.

760
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,930
I didn't want to visit the UK like this.

761
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,369
Where should we go now?

762
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:49,839
- Let's get on the bus. - Okay. Let's go!

763
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,309
- Let's go! - Is wing walking fun?

764
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,909
This is better.

765
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:58,909
Da Hee, right now or later?

766
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:01,480
- Later. - I'm all swollen up.

767
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:03,419
We look like newlyweds.

768
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,589
- Right? - Yes.

769
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:08,619
What?

770
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,619
- You don't look like newlyweds. - Not at all.

771
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,659
- Newlyweds, my foot. - You look like colleagues.

772
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:15,200
What are you doing right now?

773
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,329
- You said you were sick of him. - You were sick of Sang Yeob.

774
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:21,200
He looks more handsome in the UK.

775
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:24,740
When my swelling goes down tomorrow, I'll look awesome.

776
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,809
His well-defined, facial features suit the UK.

777
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,540
- Da Hee. - My goodness.

778
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,849
- Jeon So Min, Jeon So Min - So Min.

779
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:36,750
- Jeon So Min, Jeon So Min - So Min.

780
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:37,819
(Shy)

781
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:40,020
- So Min. - So Min.

782
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,990
(Shy)

783
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,089
What's happening on your honeymoon?

784
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:46,990
- What's going on? - You're on your honeymoon.

785
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:50,099
- Lee Da Hee, Lee Da Hee - Da Hee.

786
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:51,569
- Da Hee. - Da Hee.

787
00:29:51,569 --> 00:29:55,339
- You should be grateful. - Thank you.

788
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,809
- Lee Da Hee - Lee Da Hee

789
00:29:57,809 --> 00:29:59,909
- Lee Sang Yeob... - Lee Sang Uk?

790
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:01,510
- Lee Sa Yeob? - What's his name?

791
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,109
- Lee Sa? - Lee Sang Yo?

792
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,010
They're trying to remember Sang Yeob's name.

793
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,379
- They're discussing. - They're talking about it.

794
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
- Lee Sang Yeob, Lee Sang Yeob - Lee Sang Yeob, Lee Sang Yeob

795
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,619
(Thank you, guys.)

796
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:13,450
After shouting Da Hee's name,

797
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,619
they were not sure.

798
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,359
(Sang Yeob?)

799
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,260
- "Lee Sang Uk?" - There was a discussion.

800
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,300
It was silent for a moment.

801
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,569
(It feels good to be in the UK.)

802
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,230
- Let's go. - It's 4am in Seoul,

803
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,970
- but I don't feel tired. - Right.

804
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,609
I feel okay for some reason.

805
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:33,569
Da Hee got some sleep on the flight.

806
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,579
- I did. - Right?

807
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,510
- Sang Yeob slept too. - You snored.

808
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,980
I didn't.

809
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,309
I thought it was a tiger.

810
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,349
Da Hee, you snored.

811
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,849
It's okay.

812
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,520
- It's okay. - It was really you?

813
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,819
(It was really you?)

814
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:51,589
I didn't snore. I never do.

815
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,500
I sleep quietly like a baby.

816
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,859
What are you talking about?

817
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:58,930
- Like a baby? - What are you talking about?

818
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,940
- My nickname is Baby. - Baby?

819
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,069
I heard you snore.

820
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:05,409
- What are you talking about? - I sleep quietly like a baby.

821
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:08,210
You slept like a baby tiger.

822
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,409
What?

823
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:13,379
I see words I know everywhere. "Short-stay car park".

824
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,819
- You know what it means, right? - Temporary stay.

825
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,020
English is not difficult.

826
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,919
- Look. "Emergency exit". - If it's not difficult,

827
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,389
why were you so quiet at the immigration desk earlier?

828
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,129
The officer kept talking, but you didn't say anything.

829
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:32,099
Look around. Don't be afraid of English.

830
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,899
If you're so good at English,

831
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,609
why did you say, "Coffee pot, come on"?

832
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:40,010
(Why did you say, "Coffee pot, come on"?)

833
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,609
- Why did you say that? - "Coffee pot, come on"?

834
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,750
- "Coffee pot, come on." - It just...

835
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,579
- slipped my mind. - Why did you do that?

836
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,879
It's like a foreigner saying,

837
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:53,149
"Come here, coffee pot," in Korean.

838
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:56,220
- "Come on." - And they brought it to you.

839
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,490
- "Come on." - They understood...

840
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,230
- what you meant. - "Coffee pot, come on."

841
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,629
"Come here, coffee pot."

842
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:03,329
Tonight, you'll be staying...

843
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,069
- at an ordinary hotel. - Will it be an ordinary place?

844
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:09,500
- Tomorrow, at the ghost castle. - Why are you doing this to us?

845
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:11,409
I completely forgot about it.

846
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,609
What if Seok Jin wakes up in the morning...

847
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:17,079
and suddenly sounds like a baby?

848
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,909
(What if he becomes possessed by a baby ghost?)

849
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:20,109
What should I do then?

850
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:22,379
(It might really happen.)

851
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:25,550
In the early 90s, on SBS,

852
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,159
a TV show had a Japanese hypnotist as a guest.

853
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,960
Seok Jin stroked a shoe as if it were a cat under hypnosis.

854
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:35,829
- Really? - I was under hypnosis.

855
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,200
- Is there a video? - Were you hypnotized?

856
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:42,869
(This is the video of Seok Jin under hypnosis 20 years ago.)

857
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,569
(How is your dog right now?)

858
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:47,210
(He seems hungry.)

859
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:52,210
(Comedian Kim Ji Sun)

860
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:54,720
(I feel sorry for him.)

861
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,220
(Seok Jin was hypnotized by a world-renowned hypnotist.)

862
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,619
I was hypnotized for real.

863
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,460
- Really? - You weren't pretending?

864
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,389
- He wasn't. - It was for real.

865
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:06,190
- He was hypnotized. - That's incredible.

866
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,659
I watched it on TV and laughed a lot.

867
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,700
Yong Man and I wondered...

868
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,869
whether Seok Jin put on a show to become a star...

869
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,470
- or if it was for real. - He was pretending.

870
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,569
(Has Seok Jin always been like this?)

871
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:20,809
But Seok Jin does fall for those things easily.

872
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:22,109
I do.

873
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:23,280
He does.

874
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,010
Is it because you focus easily?

875
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,119
- It's the opposite. - It means you're weak.

876
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,349
(It means you're weak.)

877
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:32,990
(You brats.)

878
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,720
In 15 minutes, we'll stop by at a rest area.

879
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,829
Would you like to play a game to give someone a badge?

880
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:41,430
- I'm good at it. - Timing game.

881
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,430
- I have nothing to lose. - One badge?

882
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,230
That's right.

883
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,099
If two people say a number at the same time, they both lose.

884
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,599
- Okay. - Okay.

885
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,409
- Just one round. - Timing game.

886
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,710
I'm going to say, "one".

887
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,510
- I'm going to say, "1". - I'm going to say, "1".

888
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,909
- I'm serious. - I don't want a badge.

889
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,710
- I'm going to say, "1". - I'm going to say, "2".

890
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,750
- I'm going to say, "1". - I'm going to say, "1".

891
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,520
Ready. You have to raise your hand too.

892
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:05,750
- Let's go. - Ready. Set. Go.

893
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,750
- 1. - 2.

894
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,020
- 3. - 4.

895
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,059
- 5. - 6.

896
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,730
(Seok Jin was waiting for the right moment.)

897
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,930
- 5. - 6.

898
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,200
(He shouts the last number out loud.)

899
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,629
(I tried to be quick.)

900
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:22,869
- Gosh. - My pain went away.

901
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,010
- I thought I'd lose. - So did I.

902
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,270
You guys have such great teamwork.

903
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,210
He said, "six," so confidently.

904
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:31,450
Fine. You guys want to take advantage of me?

905
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,510
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

906
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,419
Okay.

907
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,180
- We didn't take advantage. - The game doesn't require thinking.

908
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,750
- What did we do wrong? - Let's play once more.

909
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,319
Okay, I understand.

910
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,819
(Seok Jin gets a penalty badge.)

911
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:45,629
(They finally arrive in Zurich after 17 hours of flight.)

912
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:47,059
The weather is great.

913
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,559
- The weather is so beautiful. - It's unbelievable.

914
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,700
It's so cool.

915
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,899
- Who said that it's cold here? - Thank goodness.

916
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,870
- It's summer. - The weather is amazing.

917
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,010
- Okay! - The weather is incredible.

918
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,740
It's amazing.

919
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,510
There's not an inch of fine dust.

920
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,850
- The air is different. - I can see everything.

921
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,010
We heard top secret information.

922
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:08,479
Are we riding a train?

923
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,850
It took about a day to get here.

924
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:12,149
That's right.

925
00:35:12,149 --> 00:35:14,050
I wouldn't be surprised if we're in Brazil.

926
00:35:14,149 --> 00:35:16,319
You have so many bugs on you, Ji Hyo.

927
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:19,060
- It's because of the color. - It's because we couldn't shower.

928
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,530
- I didn't get a chance to shower. - Can we please wash?

929
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,430
This is the Luxury Package.

930
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,530
- You're in Zurich, Switzerland. - Right.

931
00:35:25,729 --> 00:35:28,100
You're in Zurich, Switzerland.

932
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,669
Do we have to do that?

933
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:31,839
- That's fake. - It's fake.

934
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,140
Really?

935
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,839
- We're in Zurich, Switzerland. - Why don't we...

936
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,180
- play along? - Just do it, Jong Kook.

937
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,050
- Let's do it. - In 1, 2, 3.

938
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:41,680
(Screaming in joy)

939
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,850
In 1, 2, 3.

940
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:45,490
(They scream in joy while waving their arms.)

941
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:49,019
- This is great. - I'm excited.

942
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,129
(We can't believe that we're in Switzerland.)

943
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,300
- Is this a drama? - Luxurious Switzerland.

944
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,530
We're filming a drama.

945
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,700
Everyone.

946
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,030
You finally arrived in Zurich, Switzerland.

947
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,499
We almost got in trouble while passing immigration customs.

948
00:36:02,499 --> 00:36:04,470
- What happened? - Jin Young looked different.

949
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,069
(Jin Young looked different from her photo.)

950
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:11,249
- He said... - He looked at my passport photo.

951
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,749
He looked confused.

952
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,180
I asked him if I looked different.

953
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:17,249
What did I say?

954
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,089
- "Face upgrade". - "Upgrade".

955
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:21,089
(The simple answer was face upgrade.)

956
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:22,160
"Face upgrade".

957
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,819
"Face upgrade".

958
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,160
- Seriously. - He let me go.

959
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,589
He let her pass immediately.

960
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:28,499
He thought that she was bold.

961
00:36:28,499 --> 00:36:30,330
At least she's honest.

962
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:32,870
Let's go to the train station.

963
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,539
- Okay, let's go. - Let's go.

964
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:35,870
- Are we going to a train station? - Let's go.

965
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,269
Let's go.

966
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,039
(The city's life and culture can be found at train stations.)

967
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,510
Is this the train station?

968
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,950
Okay, it's a railway.

969
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,749
- Jin Young. - Yes?

970
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,519
Will you keep looking around?

971
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:53,789
I'm in a foreign country. I don't look around in Seoul.

972
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,160
It looks similar to Cheongnyangni Station, Line One.

973
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,589
It seems like Seoul Station.

974
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:59,030
- The ambiance is similar. - Doesn't it?

975
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,330
- It's here. - Is that it? It arrived.

976
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,200
There's a place to put luggage.

977
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,899
(It's a second-story train.)

978
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,100
Be careful on your right.

979
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,669
(They climb up to the 2nd floor.)

980
00:37:09,669 --> 00:37:10,939
It's amazing.

981
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,870
(There's a lounge with a couch.)

982
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,410
It's amazing.

983
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,979
- Goodness. - This is incredible.

984
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,649
This must be a romantic train.

985
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:21,950
- This is great. - It's romantic.

986
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,919
- It's romantic. - It's beautiful compared to the UK.

987
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,950
- Right. - We have better members too.

988
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,289
This is a place for lovers to visit.

989
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,289
- Do you want to sit here? - This is great.

990
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:33,060
- It's okay. - Two of you are perfect.

991
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,530
(Jin Young and Jong Kook are perfect together.)

992
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,229
Your outfits are also similar.

993
00:37:37,229 --> 00:37:38,499
You make a perfect couple.

994
00:37:38,499 --> 00:37:40,300
- Shall I change seats? - It's too fake.

995
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,439
- It's uncomfortable. - Stop it.

996
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,769
- Don't be fake. - It's fake.

997
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,370
Let's act naturally.

998
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,039
The most unnatural thing is the fact that I'm sitting here.

999
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,080
You're always together.

1000
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,209
No, that spot is perfect for your shirt color.

1001
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,280
(Hot pink is uncomfortable.)

1002
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:55,720
Since it's romantic, let's get romantic.

1003
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,720
- Okay. - How do you mean?

1004
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,450
Let's switch partners.

1005
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,050
- Why do we have to? - Partners?

1006
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,089
Do we even have any?

1007
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:02,890
- You don't like your partner. - He doesn't.

1008
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,120
You don't like me?

1009
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,990
She's better than her.

1010
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,600
(Han Na is better than Ji Hyo who's like family.)

1011
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,959
- How about Han Na? - Ji Hyo is...

1012
00:38:09,959 --> 00:38:11,069
I prefer Han Na.

1013
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,399
- He should be Han Na's partner. - Would that be better?

1014
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:14,499
She's like my sister.

1015
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,669
Let's go to the restaurant cart for a meal.

1016
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,910
We should be romantic on the train.

1017
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,780
- We should act. - It's a romantic train.

1018
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,910
It's the first time that we met. I have nothing.

1019
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,080
I'll be someone with a strong personality.

1020
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,649
- "A strong personality"? - Yes.

1021
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:30,720
(Three male members move first.)

1022
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,220
- This is great. - Okay.

1023
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,560
(Will they find romance in the restaurant cart?)

1024
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,319
It's perfect for a date.

1025
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,560
It's like a date.

1026
00:38:40,089 --> 00:38:42,499
Since it's hot, let's order something expensive and cool.

1027
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:43,760
- Okay. - That sounds good.

1028
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,870
(He pulls out his hair.)

1029
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,930
Pull it out.

1030
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,669
- You look good. - Right?

1031
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:52,970
- They're here. - They're here.

1032
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:56,640
(The first shy woman to enter is Ji Hyo.)

1033
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,050
(Hello, boys.)

1034
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,379
(The 1st woman makes a move.)

1035
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:04,720
"Hot Swiss Classics".

1036
00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:07,189
I'll get a salad.

1037
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,660
(I knew it.)

1038
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,660
(Se Chan is the only one she can trust.)

1039
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,830
(Yawning)

1040
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,200
(He yawns all of a sudden.)

1041
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,200
(How could you?)

1042
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,370
(The members are heartless to their own members.)

1043
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,839
I'll choose...

1044
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:24,370
(What is Ji Hyo's final choice?)

1045
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,640
(Tapping)

1046
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:30,539
Okay.

1047
00:39:30,539 --> 00:39:32,379
You look handsome with one eye covered.

1048
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:35,479
(This handsome man is mine.)

1049
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,689
He's the type of men she likes.

1050
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,490
You look better with your hair back.

1051
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:45,660
I found my partner.

1052
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,100
(Next up is Han Na.)

1053
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,760
Goodness.

1054
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,269
Why do you have bangs?

1055
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:52,569
(My name is Haha.)

1056
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,569
Why are you pretending to be handsome?

1057
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:56,039
You're here.

1058
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:58,910
(Rolling up his sleeve)

1059
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,209
(Will it attract Han Na?)

1060
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:03,479
(It's possible.)

1061
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:05,410
- I came to join you. - Okay.

1062
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,010
(I came to join you.)

1063
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,720
What's with your arm?

1064
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,620
- What? Do I look masculine? - What are you doing?

1065
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,819
(In the end, my partner must be...)

1066
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:14,689
- Hello, honey. - Hello.

1067
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:16,919
Who's buying the meal?

1068
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,260
Let's eat first.

1069
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,729
- Let's eat. - Let's enjoy it.

1070
00:40:19,729 --> 00:40:22,060
I have enough money, so order expensive dishes.

1071
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,399
Shall we order three dishes?

1072
00:40:23,399 --> 00:40:25,470
- Order 4. We'll have 2 each. - "Order 4"?

1073
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,399
- "Swiss beef with fried onions". - That sounds good. Order that.

1074
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:33,109
Let's order one salad. It'll be refreshing.

1075
00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:35,479
Can you order some kimchi?

1076
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:36,640
- Kimchi? - Yes.

1077
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,510
Then I'll order...

1078
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,350
- gamjatang. - "Gamjatang"?

1079
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,680
- Gamjatang with bones. - With bones?

1080
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,620
(The restaurant waiter arrives.)

1081
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,490
- This one? - Is it okay?

1082
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,189
- That's okay. - One Caesar salad...

1083
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:52,289
- and one beef. - Okay.

1084
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,399
One multi-vitamin juice, please.

1085
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,800
- Han Na is amazing. - Thank you.

1086
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,430
Finished.

1087
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,600
(He feels dispirited.)

1088
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,669
It's basic English.

1089
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:03,999
It's difficult.

1090
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:05,069
(She's too good for him.)

1091
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:06,709
Here's your salad.

1092
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,280
- That was fast. Thank you. - Thank you.

1093
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,510
Here you go.

1094
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,810
Try some, Han Na.

1095
00:41:10,879 --> 00:41:12,379
- You ordered it. - Is it macaroni?

1096
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,080
- What's this? - It's beef.

1097
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:18,089
(Six men and women start their meals.)

1098
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,350
It looks delicious.

1099
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,519
It's so delicious that I'll pass out.

1100
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,330
(He passes out due to embarrassment.)

1101
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,560
(The food is delicious, and the view is beautiful.)

1102
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,370
I hope tomorrow's weather will be like today.

1103
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:34,839
(One more hour of transfer will bring them to Zermatt.)

1104
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:36,470
It's pretty here. Look.

1105
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,709
Look at the ceiling.

1106
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:40,109
- This is great. - It's pretty.

1107
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,539
(They're impressed.)

1108
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,879
- We are - We only say hello.

1109
00:41:43,879 --> 00:41:46,780
- In Switzerland - In Switzerland

1110
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,180
The train is moving.

1111
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,550
(They've been traveling for 21 hours.)

1112
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,149
I feel so much better.

1113
00:41:52,149 --> 00:41:54,519
- Enjoy it as much as possible. - Until now, I didn't feel...

1114
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,589
- like we were in Switzerland. - I know.

1115
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:57,890
Now it feels like Switzerland.

1116
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:01,200
- It's so beautiful. - Look at the view.

1117
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,629
There's a waterfall.

1118
00:42:03,629 --> 00:42:05,100
This is our life.

1119
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,970
Where is the water coming from?

1120
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:09,269
This is amazing.

1121
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,800
- It's nature. - Look at that.

1122
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:12,609
It's a romantic ride.

1123
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:13,870
(This is a romantic ride.)

1124
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,109
(Impressed)

1125
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,510
This is insane.

1126
00:42:18,709 --> 00:42:20,249
It's a bridge.

1127
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,689
You say that you like me

1128
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:27,390
(They're about to face their harsh fates.)

1129
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,959
(This bus is heading to Oxford.)

1130
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:32,789
It's "Y" by Freestyle. I love this song.

1131
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:35,399
- Whose song is it? - It's "Y" by Freestyle.

1132
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,700
- It was my background music. - This one?

1133
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,430
- It was mine too. - Me too.

1134
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,140
It was the most popular song on Cyworld at that time.

1135
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,410
("Y" by Freestyle is a popular, sentimental song.)

1136
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,740
(She goes back to that time and feeling.)

1137
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,850
The background of my homepage was snowing with this song.

1138
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,620
(A snowing homepage)

1139
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,819
It was snowing in the background.

1140
00:42:58,819 --> 00:43:00,789
My character had a hairstyle...

1141
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:02,189
I wrote this on the main page.

1142
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,330
"Three things that we can't hide".

1143
00:43:04,729 --> 00:43:07,129
"Cold, cough,"

1144
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,459
"and love".

1145
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:13,030
Goodness, he's blushing.

1146
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:16,169
- "Cold, cough, and love". - "Love".

1147
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:18,640
What are the three things you can't hide?

1148
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:20,169
Me?

1149
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,979
Farting.

1150
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,249
No way, Da Hee.

1151
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:26,280
It's fatsia.

1152
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,879
- Fatsia? - Fatsia?

1153
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:29,120
No.

1154
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,749
Yours are fart, sound, and smell.

1155
00:43:31,749 --> 00:43:33,720
- No way. - Three things that you can't hide.

1156
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,089
Fart, sound, and smell.

1157
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:36,760
Please get ready.

1158
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:39,959
We're having a good time. What now?

1159
00:43:40,459 --> 00:43:42,660
- Wait. - Goodness.

1160
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,859
They're mission bags.

1161
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,930
What are they?

1162
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,370
- Wait a minute. - Da Hee.

1163
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,539
There's money inside.

1164
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:52,039
- It's from the Brazil World Cup. - What's this?

1165
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:53,510
- There's money. - Can we look?

1166
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:55,080
It's 10 euros.

1167
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:58,550
- Aren't you hungry? - Yes.

1168
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:01,419
We're at a resting area in the UK.

1169
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:03,979
Order a takeout that you'd like to eat.

1170
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:07,789
Bring the takeout outside, and eat together.

1171
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:09,289
- Okay. - It's not a mission, right?

1172
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:11,490
- You must get a takeout. - A takeout?

1173
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:12,729
It's a takeout.

1174
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:14,300
Do we get a takeout?

1175
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,700
It doesn't matter what it is. You can buy snacks.

1176
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,800
Okay.

1177
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,530
- Let's get it. - Let's get it.

1178
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,899
(They go to a resting area for food.)

1179
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:24,269
What should I eat for dinner?

1180
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,140
I want to eat something new.

1181
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:27,310
Something unique.

1182
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:29,979
- There's a food court. - It's really big.

1183
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,410
There are many choices.

1184
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,310
The UK is great.

1185
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,879
- Gosh, what's that? - What is that?

1186
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:37,479
What's this?

1187
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:38,990
- Roast pork? - Pork?

1188
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,249
- It's pork? - Yes.

1189
00:44:41,089 --> 00:44:42,660
What are you going to eat?

1190
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,019
(What are you going to eat, Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo?)

1191
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,229
We're looking around first.

1192
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:49,430
- Hi. - Hello.

1193
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,069
(Smiling)

1194
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,069
- That looks tasty. - What's that flirtatious smile?

1195
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,439
What did you just do?

1196
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:58,140
I've never seen you smile like that before.

1197
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,479
(You're supposed to smile when you speak English.)

1198
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:03,640
I'm so embarrassed.

1199
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,410
Be quiet.

1200
00:45:08,649 --> 00:45:09,919
(Jae Seok stops at a Mexican place.)

1201
00:45:09,919 --> 00:45:11,149
They have nachos and burritos.

1202
00:45:11,189 --> 00:45:12,550
(Jae Seok stops at a Mexican place.)

1203
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,089
I want a burrito.

1204
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,160
(I want a burrito.)

1205
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,919
I'm worried about something.

1206
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,129
He's not going to just give me a burrito.

1207
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,229
- He'll ask you questions, right? - It'll be...

1208
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:23,830
If he starts to ask me many questions,

1209
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:24,899
it'll be hard.

1210
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:26,530
But you've been here before.

1211
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,999
Of course. Don't worry.

1212
00:45:29,069 --> 00:45:30,640
Excuse me. Two.

1213
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,640
(Jae Seok orders.)

1214
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,039
- No more chicken. - No more?

1215
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:34,780
(He goes through the steps confidently.)

1216
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,839
Yes. Cheese.

1217
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,410
Sour cream?

1218
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,609
- Sour cream? - Yes, please.

1219
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,850
(His burrito is done.)

1220
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:42,879
It's done.

1221
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,789
(Relieved)

1222
00:45:45,149 --> 00:45:48,120
Is this... Pork?

1223
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,990
(Seok Jin gets pork.)

1224
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:52,560
That's pork skin, right?

1225
00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:54,030
I want to try it.

1226
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:56,760
That's nice.

1227
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,970
Is that on Youtube?

1228
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,330
Is that on Youtube?

1229
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,999
- You... - Youtube?

1230
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:05,140
Youtube? Yes.

1231
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,410
What's your name?

1232
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,680
What is your name then?

1233
00:46:08,939 --> 00:46:10,010
Write it down, please.

1234
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,649
- Big Nose. - Write it down.

1235
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,249
- I might have a look. - Yes, yes.

1236
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:19,919
(Does he want to write to me?)

1237
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:22,519
I should write down my name then. Yes.

1238
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:25,160
Yes, yes, yes.

1239
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:28,060
- "Jee Seok Jin"? - Yes, Mr. Jee.

1240
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,229
- Jee. - Yes.

1241
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,439
(Mr. Jee becomes an internet star.)

1242
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:37,740
(They're done getting food.)

1243
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:39,740
(Outdoor eating area)

1244
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,410
You can eat...

1245
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:43,109
your food now.

1246
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:45,979
Can we share our food?

1247
00:46:45,979 --> 00:46:47,010
As you wish.

1248
00:46:47,209 --> 00:46:48,850
Kwang Soo, is that all you got?

1249
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,080
What did you get?

1250
00:46:50,479 --> 00:46:51,550
I just got some fruits.

1251
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:53,919
Why did you get only fruits?

1252
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:56,419
I went for quantity rather than quality.

1253
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:58,229
(A pack of sushi rolls)

1254
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:04,600
(It's Shuddering Package, but they get to enjoy a meal.)

1255
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:06,769
Gosh.

1256
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:08,039
(That was tasty.)

1257
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:09,339
I really enjoyed it.

1258
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,039
I love this.

1259
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,209
(Have some desserts.)

1260
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,640
- Are you done eating? - Yes.

1261
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,109
To determine who will be excluded from wing walking,

1262
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:22,080
carry out the second mission, Eat to Fly.

1263
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,120
(Eat to Fly)

1264
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,289
- Eat to Fly? - What?

1265
00:47:24,649 --> 00:47:25,749
We're done eating.

1266
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,319
We asked you...

1267
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,760
to get takeout.

1268
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,260
You'll fold airplanes using your food wrappers and fly them.

1269
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,669
Three people whose airplanes fly the shortest distance...

1270
00:47:38,669 --> 00:47:40,169
will get 3, 2, and 1 badges respectively.

1271
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:41,669
All I have is aluminum foil.

1272
00:47:41,669 --> 00:47:42,800
(The bottom three will get penalty badges.)

1273
00:47:43,499 --> 00:47:45,240
(All I have is aluminum foil.)

1274
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,910
Look.

1275
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,740
You should have told me before I crumpled it.

1276
00:47:48,979 --> 00:47:50,680
It's all crumpled up now.

1277
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,280
What is this?

1278
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:56,680
(While trying to reduce trash, he shortened his life.)

1279
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,620
You have to make it look at least somewhat like an airplane.

1280
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,890
- What about... - Hold on.

1281
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,260
You have to make it look at least somewhat like an airplane.

1282
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:04,629
(How can you make this look like an airplane?)

1283
00:48:04,629 --> 00:48:05,859
I don't have any wrappers.

1284
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,859
(Kwang Soo is dumbfounded by the unexpected mission.)

1285
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,060
I don't have anything.

1286
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,930
- Gosh. - Hold on.

1287
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,700
You can use scissors and tape if you want.

1288
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,939
I mean...

1289
00:48:15,939 --> 00:48:18,939
I don't even have a plastic bag.

1290
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,839
- You should have asked for it. - I don't even have a plastic bag.

1291
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,839
(You should have asked.)

1292
00:48:22,839 --> 00:48:24,140
What will Kwang Soo do?

1293
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,649
Look at mine.

1294
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,479
So Min has an advantage.

1295
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:30,050
I have this too.

1296
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,390
(She has a paper bag and a thick paper tray.)

1297
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:32,519
I only have aluminum foil.

1298
00:48:32,919 --> 00:48:36,319
Gosh, we've been...

1299
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,459
(We've been cracking up a lot.)

1300
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,089
We've been cracking up a lot in the UK.

1301
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,200
- Hold on. - In the UK.

1302
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,660
Seok Jin just said,

1303
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,870
"My bladder will burst."

1304
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:47,769
(Seok Jin just said, "My bladder will burst.")

1305
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,069
Is it okay? Can it air?

1306
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,140
Are you feeling okay?

1307
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:54,240
- I heard it clearly. - Me too.

1308
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,280
Do you want to pee?

1309
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:57,280
Why did you say that?

1310
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,580
I said, "We've been cracking up a lot."

1311
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,950
- You said, "bladder". - Hey.

1312
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:01,319
- "My bladder will burst." - Not my bladder.

1313
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:02,919
- You said, "bladder". - I said, "We've been cracking up."

1314
00:49:02,919 --> 00:49:04,789
Is there something wrong with your ears?

1315
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:06,950
Replay it. I heard, "My bladder will burst."

1316
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:08,160
(Let's replay the video.)

1317
00:49:08,589 --> 00:49:11,729
My bladder will burst.

1318
00:49:12,459 --> 00:49:14,189
"We've been cracking up a lot."

1319
00:49:14,189 --> 00:49:15,399
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok heard it right.)

1320
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:17,200
- My goodness. - Gosh!

1321
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,330
It's torn.

1322
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,100
Yours looks okay.

1323
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,370
Mine is torn into pieces.

1324
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:24,839
- What happened? - I tore it.

1325
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:25,870
(It's her habit.)

1326
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:27,839
- This tape won't stick. - Okay, okay.

1327
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,709
It keeps slipping.

1328
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,149
Let me try.

1329
00:49:31,149 --> 00:49:32,310
What am I going to do?

1330
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:34,080
This is a perfect airplane.

1331
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,649
This is a perfect airplane. Everyone.

1332
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:41,060
I have the best material, so I'm going to...

1333
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,589
That looks amazing.

1334
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,089
I'm going to add Kwang Soo on the wing.

1335
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:47,089
- That's incredible. - I'm serious. I'm doing this.

1336
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,060
You never know who will win...

1337
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:51,069
even though my wrapper has rice on it.

1338
00:49:51,069 --> 00:49:52,569
(You never know who will win.)

1339
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:53,830
We won't know until we fly them.

1340
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:56,399
It has to look like an airplane.

1341
00:49:56,399 --> 00:49:58,740
It looks like an airplane!

1342
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,439
These are wings.

1343
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:04,080
That's not an airplane.

1344
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,280
Don't use tape. It's not going to work.

1345
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,479
Wait and see.

1346
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,749
(Jae Seok's aluminum foil is folded into a plane.)

1347
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:12,419
It looks okay, right?

1348
00:50:12,419 --> 00:50:14,120
That looks like an airplane.

1349
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,089
I even added...

1350
00:50:16,089 --> 00:50:19,089
Kwang Soo on the wing.

1351
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,530
(Kwang Soo will be wing walking.)

1352
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,899
Why did you do that?

1353
00:50:21,899 --> 00:50:24,729
- Kwang Soo, fly. - Sang Yeob did a good job.

1354
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,970
- It won't fly. - It won't fly.

1355
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,200
I can't even practice. It'd destroy my plane.

1356
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:31,209
Right?

1357
00:50:31,209 --> 00:50:33,740
No one can practice!

1358
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:36,810
Can you clean up here? What are you doing?

1359
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,749
- What? - What are you doing?

1360
00:50:38,749 --> 00:50:40,879
(Da Hee does her best to the end.)

1361
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,879
(She focuses on her work while everyone else is laughing.)

1362
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,189
- Seok Jin. - Seriously.

1363
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,819
(She builds the frame with her chopsticks.)

1364
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,789
(She makes sure the wings are balanced.)

1365
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,129
You have to get the tail and the wings right.

1366
00:50:57,129 --> 00:50:58,600
(She fixes the tail and the wings carefully.)

1367
00:50:59,229 --> 00:51:03,740
(Will Da Hee's aluminum foil airplane fly?)

1368
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:06,470
We all have something that looks like an airplane.

1369
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:07,879
Please.

1370
00:51:07,879 --> 00:51:10,039
- The rest of us should step back. - Okay.

1371
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:12,709
(Seok Jin used his styrofoam box.)

1372
00:51:12,709 --> 00:51:14,550
- Fly. - You stepped on the line.

1373
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,280
You stepped on the line.

1374
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:18,319
You're being so strict.

1375
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,350
- If you do it again, you're out. - You'll be out.

1376
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,990
Please.

1377
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,990
(Please fly far.)

1378
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:29,430
(It falls.)

1379
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:30,629
It didn't go far.

1380
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:34,300
(Seok Jin's airplane falls near the starting line.)

1381
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,740
It didn't go that far.

1382
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:40,269
- Next up is Sang Yeob. - Me?

1383
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,609
I think yours will fly far.

1384
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:43,109
- It doesn't seem to fly well. - Sang Yeob even used...

1385
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,410
chopsticks.

1386
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,550
(He made his airplane stable by using his wooden chopsticks.)

1387
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:50,749
Let's go.

1388
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:52,289
(Fly to Korea.)

1389
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,720
- Okay! - What?

1390
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:56,060
I win.

1391
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:57,120
- Sang Yeob. - Sang Yeob.

1392
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,289
No. You should measure from the tail.

1393
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:01,129
You're supposed to measure from the tail.

1394
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,499
In all games... What's that called?

1395
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,629
In all games... What's that called?

1396
00:52:07,229 --> 00:52:09,499
- What? - The jumping...

1397
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:11,269
Get some sleep.

1398
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,640
Give me the car key.

1399
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,510
Seok Jin needs to sleep.

1400
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,209
- You mean neolttwigi? - The jump...

1401
00:52:18,209 --> 00:52:20,510
- Neolttwigi? - You measure backwards.

1402
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,950
That's the right way.

1403
00:52:22,149 --> 00:52:23,479
Sang Yeob wins.

1404
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,089
- I'm in first place for now. - It didn't...

1405
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:26,120
Next up is So Min.

1406
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,660
That's a perfect airplane.

1407
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,660
I'm looking forward.

1408
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,089
(So Min used her chicken pie bag.)

1409
00:52:34,459 --> 00:52:35,700
- I hope it'll turn back. - Please.

1410
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:36,930
It'll turn back.

1411
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:38,999
Love will come back.

1412
00:52:39,729 --> 00:52:42,870
Love will come back!

1413
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,810
(Come back here!)

1414
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:46,810
- It went far. - It went pretty far.

1415
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:48,510
(Flying)

1416
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:50,539
(It ended up half a step ahead of Seok Jin's and Sang Yeob's.)

1417
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,979
She's in first place for now.

1418
00:52:52,979 --> 00:52:54,010
- Please step back. - She's in first place.

1419
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:56,919
It didn't fly as far as I expected. I did better while practicing.

1420
00:52:57,319 --> 00:52:58,689
Please step back.

1421
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:00,050
(The fourth player, Jae Seok's turn)

1422
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,019
This aluminum foil airplane...

1423
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,560
- might fly far. - It might...

1424
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,160
- fly far. - You never know.

1425
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,229
Fling it to the ground.

1426
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:09,129
(Good luck, burrito wrapper airplane.)

1427
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,830
- Fling it to the ground. - Even...

1428
00:53:12,129 --> 00:53:13,970
Jae Seok's airplane is ugly.

1429
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,339
Look at that plane.

1430
00:53:16,399 --> 00:53:17,640
See?

1431
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,740
Look at that.

1432
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:25,149
(Is it to wish Jae Seok good luck?)

1433
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,850
Fling it to the ground.

1434
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,979
As a kid, I entered a glider competition.

1435
00:53:31,749 --> 00:53:34,050
(You never know who will win.)

1436
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:40,030
(Jae Seok is ready to fly his aluminum foil airplane.)

1437
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:42,100
Fling it to the ground.

1438
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:48,039
(He only has to get past the others to avoid getting a badge.)

1439
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,240
Fling it... Yes!

1440
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,109
- He flung it. - He flung it.

1441
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:56,010
(Glider Yu, fling it down!)

1442
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,479
- He flung it. - He flung it.

1443
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:00,879
He's definitely at the bottom.

1444
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,720
It's even torn.

1445
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,919
Who is up next?

1446
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:06,620
- Me. - Da Hee.

1447
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,589
(Another aluminum foil airplane)

1448
00:54:09,459 --> 00:54:10,959
Da Hee's looks good.

1449
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:14,729
I even won a prize at a paragliding competition.

1450
00:54:14,729 --> 00:54:17,100
- What does that have to do with... - I know how planes work.

1451
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,399
What does paragliding have to do with this?

1452
00:54:19,399 --> 00:54:22,100
I mean hang gliding.

1453
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,069
Hang gliding has nothing to do with paper airplanes either.

1454
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:27,039
- Anyway, just watch. - Okay.

1455
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:28,640
I won't say anything more.

1456
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,780
You're very talkative.

1457
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,410
You're very talkative.

1458
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,390
- I'm confident about this. - You're confident?

1459
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:40,850
- What are you confident about? - We just made planes with foil.

1460
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,620
- Why is she confident? - Hey.

1461
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,459
I think she ironed the foil.

1462
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:47,459
- It's really straight. - I made the best of the worst.

1463
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,629
But it did seem impossible to make one.

1464
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,629
I have to throw it like this from here, right? Just like this?

1465
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:52,870
From here, throw it like this.

1466
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:55,269
- Like this. Like throwing a dart. - Throw it like you would a dart.

1467
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:57,569
In other words, you can't throw it like this.

1468
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,209
- You threw it like this though. - By the way...

1469
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:04,450
- You're talking crazy. - Seok Jin.

1470
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,249
- If you do, you're slamming it. - Hurry. We have to hurry.

1471
00:55:07,249 --> 00:55:09,919
- Kwang Soo's plane is melting. - Hey, Kwang Soo's...

1472
00:55:10,379 --> 00:55:13,950
- One of the wings fell. It fell. - Hurry.

1473
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,120
I'll do it now.

1474
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,459
(After a slight commotion, it's time for Da Hee's plane to fly.)

1475
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:22,060
(Flying)

1476
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,959
What? What was that?

1477
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:27,870
(As it drew a beautiful parabola, the plane flew far.)

1478
00:55:29,669 --> 00:55:32,310
(My gosh, that's amazing.)

1479
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,140
What was that?

1480
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,109
- See? It can fly. - The drawing paper works, I guess.

1481
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:39,749
- She did a great job. - I'm in third place.

1482
00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:42,180
(Sang Yeob, Seok Jin, and Jae Seok could get badges.)

1483
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,950
- Next up is Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1484
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,450
(Kwang Soo's plane is about to depart.)

1485
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,560
- It'll fly far due to its weight. - Play fair.

1486
00:55:48,859 --> 00:55:51,459
(Since it's heavy, the fruit peel might fly far.)

1487
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:53,629
- Let's be fair. I'll hold this. - Okay.

1488
00:55:53,629 --> 00:55:57,459
- You can't extend your arm... - Okay, okay. I won't.

1489
00:55:57,459 --> 00:55:59,930
- Hold on. - It can't go down.

1490
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:01,970
- That's why I have to block here. - If you throw it, it'll fly far.

1491
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:06,140
- Why are you always harsh on me? - Yours...

1492
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,609
It's because yours has the highest chance.

1493
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:10,080
- You might cheat. - If you throw, it'll fly far.

1494
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,379
- I'll block here. - You can go as low as this.

1495
00:56:12,379 --> 00:56:15,479
- Move just my arm? This is allowed? - Yes. I'll hold his arm right here.

1496
00:56:15,479 --> 00:56:17,550
- I'll block him here. - The angle should look like this.

1497
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,419
- Then how can I fly my plane? - I'll cover here.

1498
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,359
If everyone blocks me, how can I fly mine?

1499
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:23,459
- But this is necessary. - Keep the right angle.

1500
00:56:23,459 --> 00:56:27,160
- Just use your wrist. - How can I fly it like this?

1501
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,859
I made mine with aluminum foil.

1502
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,330
- But this is... - You can do this. Try it.

1503
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:32,569
- I'll hold Kwang Soo's body. - Your feet can't go over here.

1504
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:35,370
- Wait. Let me try it without you. - Sure, sure.

1505
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,209
- If it's off, you can adjust it. - Okay, okay. That sounds fair.

1506
00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:40,370
- Yours can fly only once. - If you don't think it's fair.

1507
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:42,640
- Your plane can fly only once. - It will break.

1508
00:56:43,979 --> 00:56:45,609
I think you'll have to throw it out right away.

1509
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:47,550
(If his fruit plane flies...)

1510
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:52,850
(and passes Sang Yeob's plane, he won't get a badge.)

1511
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,520
(It's his practice round. What's the result?)

1512
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,909
I think you'll have to throw it out right away.

1513
00:56:56,909 --> 00:56:58,850
(If his fruit plane flies...)

1514
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:04,150
(and passes Sang Yeob's plane, he won't get a badge.)

1515
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,420
(It's his practice round. What's the result?)

1516
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,389
- Hey. Hey. - See? Look at that.

1517
00:57:09,989 --> 00:57:11,659
(It's almost throwing the tangerine.)

1518
00:57:11,659 --> 00:57:13,600
- I can't throw it like this? - What was that?

1519
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,500
- This isn't allowed? - You threw the plane.

1520
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,969
- This is unacceptable. - If you do that...

1521
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,770
- No. No! - This is unacceptable.

1522
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,239
(Slipping)

1523
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:27,980
(As he slips, he falls on the fruit plane.)

1524
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:31,310
- No! - I slipped on it.

1525
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,420
My plane!

1526
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,319
- Hey, I slipped on the banana peel. - No, no.

1527
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:38,119
- My plane. - It was the banana peel.

1528
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:39,659
- I'm sorry. - You have to fly yours now.

1529
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,420
- I slipped on the banana peel. - This is annoying.

1530
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,060
- Okay, okay. Hold on. - Poor Kwang Soo.

1531
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,290
- I'll do it. - Hold him.

1532
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,060
- He'll throw it. It'll go far. - I didn't do it on purpose.

1533
00:57:48,259 --> 00:57:49,900
- It'll fly better. It's flat. - I'm still going to do it.

1534
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,299
- It will fly better. - Get ready.

1535
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,500
Start.

1536
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:55,810
(To be fair, everyone holds his arm as he uses his wrist to fly it.)

1537
00:57:55,810 --> 00:58:01,710
(Will the flattened plane fly well with just a snap of his wrist?)

1538
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,710
(Falling)

1539
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:09,049
(It plummets straight down to where his feet are.)

1540
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,520
- He's in last place. - It's Kwang Soo.

1541
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,319
(Kwang Soo gets 3. Jae Seok gets 2. And Seok Jin gets 1.)

1542
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:15,759
- There's nothing you can do. - It didn't cross the line.

1543
00:58:15,759 --> 00:58:17,230
Why did you buy the fruits?

1544
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,799
(Kwang Soo has 6 badges, Jae Seok, 3, Seok Jin, 2, and Da Hee, 2.)

1545
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:22,199
(They finally arrive at Zermatt Station.)

1546
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:25,130
- We're here. - This is making my heart race.

1547
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,500
- My heart is racing fast. - A meeting point.

1548
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,339
(It's a mountain village which is located at 1,620m altitude.)

1549
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,009
(It's the Mecca of winter sports near Switzerland-Italy border.)

1550
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:36,009
Everyone, you have arrived at the cleanest village in Switzerland,

1551
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,650
Zermatt, where Matterhorn is enclosed.

1552
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,420
(Welcome to the clean village, Zermatt.)

1553
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,319
- The air is so fresh. - This feels different.

1554
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:43,619
- It's different. - It's different indeed.

1555
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,860
- There's no fine dust. - It's the definition of nature.

1556
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,589
I'll tell you the first stop on the itinerary of the Luxury Package.

1557
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:55,000
For the 1st stop of your itinerary, you'll enjoy it at 3,100m altitude.

1558
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:57,529
- It's the observatory. - An observatory?

1559
00:58:57,529 --> 00:59:01,339
The fondue and the hotel are part of the itinerary.

1560
00:59:01,339 --> 00:59:02,339
(No need to calculate the fee.)

1561
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:03,369
Fondue.

1562
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:07,610
(On top of an authentic Swiss fondue meal with the scenery at 3,100m,)

1563
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,719
(they'll stay at the hotel, closest to the sky on a starlit night.)

1564
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,480
(This is awesome.)

1565
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,350
- And as for the added activities, - This is amazing.

1566
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:19,520
we'll calculate the fees for the mountain railway...

1567
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:22,190
and the extra food after your meal.

1568
00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:25,799
One of the staff members will be wearing the ballot box.

1569
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:28,400
We'll head out to ride the mountain railway train.

1570
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,100
- Okay! - Okay.

1571
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,100
I'm so relieved to be in Switzerland, not the UK.

1572
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,469
- I agree. - I'm so happy.

1573
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,009
The UK... Gosh.

1574
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,279
- Look to the left. - My gosh.

1575
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:41,909
(Is this scenery real?)

1576
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:46,549
It doesn't look real. It doesn't. I can't believe this.

1577
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,380
Everything looks like computer graphics.

1578
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,290
- Gosh, look. - That's it. That's it.

1579
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,389
- That's it. - Matterhorn.

1580
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,690
- We'll see without the clouds. - Everyone, look at this.

1581
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,389
- Gosh, this is out of this world. - That's Matterhorn?

1582
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:00,199
- If the clouds moved only a bit. - Hey, after seeing that, I bet...

1583
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:02,369
- there must be a spot for photos. - Hey, do you want to see this?

1584
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:03,670
Seriously. This is amazing.

1585
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:06,639
It's a shame to admire it with only my eyes.

1586
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,369
To admire it with your eyes, your eyes are too small.

1587
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:10,369
(To admire it with your eyes, your eyes are too small.)

1588
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:11,869
- Open your eyes wider. - No.

1589
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:15,610
But once it's in my eyes, it can't get out. It can't get out.

1590
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,549
- Look at the peak there. - It can't escape.

1591
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:19,520
- Someone's paragliding on the left. - Where? Where?

1592
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,679
- Look on your left. - My gosh, that person is flying.

1593
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,489
(You can paraglide while admiring the view of the Matterhorn.)

1594
01:00:28,389 --> 01:00:33,060
(They can't help but sing a song.)

1595
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,460
Why are you singing about the ocean when we're at a mountain?

1596
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,699
(You're dazzling)

1597
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,909
(My body has the tingling sensation)

1598
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,980
I thought that this kind of vibe reminded me of something.

1599
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,409
- I just remembered. - What is it?

1600
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:52,819
- It feels like "Flaming Youth". - Right?

1601
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,619
(The Youth are excited in Switzerland.)

1602
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:56,850
- I was going to mention that. - "Flaming Youth".

1603
01:00:57,049 --> 01:00:58,920
It feels like we're sitting around in the old house.

1604
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,819
(You must've felt excited just like me.)

1605
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:02,960
I see the snow. But we have...

1606
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,259
- the windows open. - Are you reminded of someone?

1607
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:06,600
(Does the beautiful snow remind you of someone?)

1608
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,000
- Someone you want to bring here. - 1, 2, 3.

1609
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:14,000
- Me? I do have someone in mind. - Who is it?

1610
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,909
(Who is the lady he wants to bring to this romantic snowfield?)

1611
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:23,080
(Anticipating)

1612
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,750
I should bring my mother here.

1613
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,790
(Come on. Your mother?)

1614
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,989
(Jong Kook is a dutiful son. This is why he can't get married.)

1615
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:38,089
Everyone, you're going to get off at Gornergrat Station...

1616
01:01:38,089 --> 01:01:39,860
- which is situated at 3,100m. - Okay.

1617
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,469
- I'm so glad to be here. - I agree. I'm so glad.

1618
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,500
Let's get off.

1619
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:48,270
- This is so beautiful. - This is Switzerland.

1620
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:49,770
(My goodness, this is Switzerland.)

1621
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,639
What a beauty.

1622
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,339
- Seriously. This is magnificent. - Gosh.

1623
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,080
Hey, let's take a photo. 1, 2, 3.

1624
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:01,380
("Flying on Matterhorn")

1625
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,690
- 1 more time. - 1, 2, 3.

1626
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,850
(We're on cloud nine since we're Team Luxury.)

1627
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,259
This is incredible.

1628
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,389
Running Man is...

1629
01:02:09,389 --> 01:02:11,529
- suitable for viewers over 12. - Suitable for viewers over 12.

1630
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:12,600
(They film the TV rating notice.)

1631
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,230
(Team UK, head over here while you wing walk!)

1632
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:19,369
- I got hungry so quickly. - Me too.

1633
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,940
It's so interesting. I keep eating, but I'm still hungry.

1634
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,580
Everyone, the first stop on your itinerary is...

1635
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:28,710
the observatory package at 3,100m altitude.

1636
01:02:28,909 --> 01:02:31,480
We'll provide the fondue and the hotel as part of your itinerary.

1637
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:34,380
We'll calculate the fees for the mountain railway train...

1638
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,690
- and the additional food you added. - Yes, we'll do that.

1639
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:40,589
Even if you're paying for the food, you can't eat it right away.

1640
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:45,089
You can only eat the food if you complete your given mission.

1641
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:47,330
- We have a mission. - It's different from what I heard.

1642
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,600
(There is a mission.)

1643
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:53,170
I'll tell you the mission that will earn you additional food.

1644
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,210
In Switzerland, the people play a game called, "Zwanzgerle".

1645
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:59,880
You must throw coins and stick them into boiled eggs.

1646
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,610
You have to stick it in the shell?

1647
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:03,650
You have to stick it in.

1648
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,020
One of you will throw a coin into the boiled egg on the team's behalf.

1649
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:09,420
If you succeed on your first try,

1650
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,190
- we'll provide you with every dish. - Then Jong Kook should do this.

1651
01:03:11,219 --> 01:03:13,960
But someone might be better at throwing than me.

1652
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,790
Se Chan might excel at throwing.

1653
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,230
If you fail, you can take one dish off the menu and try again.

1654
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,759
Can we practice?

1655
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,469
- Shouldn't we practice once? - Once?

1656
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:24,699
- You can practice once each. - We don't know how it's like.

1657
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:27,440
Like this?

1658
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:33,409
(The coin has to stick in the egg.)

1659
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,110
(Throwing)

1660
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,250
I'm sorry.

1661
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:41,179
(He throws the coin at Ji Hyo.)

1662
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:43,319
- Do you have a grudge against me? - No, I don't. I'm sorry.

1663
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:45,920
This is difficult.

1664
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:49,060
(Se Chan's coin hits the egg but doesn't penetrate it.)

1665
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,429
It's so thick, Jong Kook.

1666
01:03:50,529 --> 01:03:51,630
Let me see. I'll give it a try.

1667
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:53,699
(I'll give it a try.)

1668
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:55,500
- It doesn't stick. - Jong Kook.

1669
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,630
- It keeps breaking. - It keeps on falling apart.

1670
01:03:56,630 --> 01:04:01,199
(He's never done this before. Can he do it?)

1671
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:03,909
(The coin disappeared.)

1672
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:05,009
It went in.

1673
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:08,080
(The coin has to stick to the egg, but it's stuck in the middle.)

1674
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,110
It went in.

1675
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,009
It's so deep.

1676
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:13,920
I mean, you can't see the coin.

1677
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:15,420
- Goodness. - Look closely.

1678
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:17,989
(Watch this miracle.)

1679
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:21,089
(It's like the coin came from the egg.)

1680
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:22,860
Jong Kook did it. We'll start.

1681
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:24,560
It's stuck in here.

1682
01:04:24,989 --> 01:04:26,230
We won't practice.

1683
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:27,929
Start.

1684
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:30,299
- His power is no joke. - Take this.

1685
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:31,929
I shouldn't feel pressured.

1686
01:04:32,199 --> 01:04:34,239
- You can do it. Focus. - Good luck.

1687
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,670
Let's see.

1688
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:39,080
(If he succeeds, the entire menu is free.)

1689
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:43,480
(He succeeded during the practice. Can he do it now too?)

1690
01:04:44,049 --> 01:04:45,310
He did it.

1691
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,750
(He makes no mistakes.)

1692
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,650
- All right. - There's no other way.

1693
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:53,560
I stayed still, and the coin got stuck.

1694
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,560
- Jong Kook. - There's no other way.

1695
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,589
- Can we check? - What is he supposed to do?

1696
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:58,659
What now?

1697
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:00,960
- How are you going to take this? - There's no time. Please eat.

1698
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,270
Eat what you ordered.

1699
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,469
Thank you for the meal.

1700
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:05,639
- This is the Luxury Package. - Oh, my.

1701
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:08,469
They look so good.

1702
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,339
Look at this.

1703
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,080
(The dried beef contains the romance of the highlands of Switzerland.)

1704
01:05:14,679 --> 01:05:16,350
- This is so good. - The lamb is so good.

1705
01:05:17,409 --> 01:05:18,549
All right.

1706
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:19,779
Fondue is here.

1707
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:21,880
The fondue is boiling.

1708
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,020
Do we dip this?

1709
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,560
You went in really deep. Good job.

1710
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,790
- This is so good. - The lamb is so good.

1711
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,190
Cheese.

1712
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,460
- Cheese. - Do you want to do cheese cheers?

1713
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,000
- Cheese cheers. - Cheese cheers.

1714
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,600
- Love shot. - This reminds me of Seok Jin.

1715
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,600
Try the lamb.

1716
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,830
(They taste the fondue through a love shot.)

1717
01:05:41,299 --> 01:05:43,040
- This is so good. - The lamb is so good.

1718
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:44,540
The lamb is great.

1719
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:46,239
Try it.

1720
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,440
(Jong Kook gobbles down the food.)

1721
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:50,949
You dip this...

1722
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:54,580
- and lift it up. - This is such a luxury.

1723
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,049
(They're happy to be in the Luxury Package.)

1724
01:05:58,719 --> 01:05:59,960
I have to use the restroom.

1725
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,989
I'm full.

1726
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:04,130
(Is Se Chan excusing himself from the table?)

1727
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,630
(It looks like he's going inside to look for a restroom.)

1728
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,900
(Is nobody here?)

1729
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:15,610
(If your name is in the ballot box,)

1730
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:19,540
(your name gets added to the roulette.)

1731
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:25,250
(If you get picked on the roulette, you must pay the additional cost.)

1732
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:27,719
(You can pay, Han Na.)

1733
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,049
(If only he votes, there's a good chance Han Na will get selected.)

1734
01:06:31,049 --> 01:06:33,589
(But there's no way that's the case.)

1735
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:38,330
(Haha is writing somebody's name down too.)

1736
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,000
Did you enjoy your meal?

1737
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,860
- Yes, it was so good. - It was great.

1738
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:43,730
- It was so good. - Look at your cap.

1739
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:46,869
The additional expense for this trip...

1740
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:47,900
Right.

1741
01:06:47,969 --> 01:06:50,440
It totals to 523 dollars.

1742
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,339
(It includes the mountain railway and their meal.)

1743
01:06:54,339 --> 01:06:57,150
As you see, the ballot box is full.

1744
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,219
(We're family.)

1745
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,920
I wonder who it is.

1746
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,350
(It wasn't just me.)

1747
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,489
(If you get selected, your name gets written down.)

1748
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,219
- Here are the voting results. - Okay.

1749
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,190
First.

1750
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:12,659
It's on paper.

1751
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:16,069
- Han Na. - Okay. Write it.

1752
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:18,469
- Haha. - What?

1753
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,540
Your pupils.

1754
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,509
- Why? - It wasn't me. Write her name down.

1755
01:07:22,509 --> 01:07:24,409
- They moved six times. - No, it wasn't me.

1756
01:07:24,469 --> 01:07:25,810
Next.

1757
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,409
Who is it?

1758
01:07:27,409 --> 01:07:29,710
It's on an egg. Han Na.

1759
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,449
Really?

1760
01:07:31,449 --> 01:07:34,119
- You two are mean. - It wasn't us. What are you saying?

1761
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,119
It has to be you two.

1762
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,520
Next.

1763
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,819
Who is it?

1764
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:40,889
(Is there more?)

1765
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:43,529
It's on a chocolate wrapper.

1766
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,790
Se Chan.

1767
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:47,029
(Yang Se Chan)

1768
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,659
- Se Chan. - Oh, dear.

1769
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:50,170
What did I do?

1770
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,469
Okay.

1771
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,569
Hold on. I'll wait.

1772
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,440
Really, you guys?

1773
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,009
I'll vote.

1774
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:05,110
(Se Chan wrote Han Na's name, and she wrote his.)

1775
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,350
Next is on a leaf.

1776
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,020
- Here. - When did they do that?

1777
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:11,389
(It's on a leaf.)

1778
01:08:11,389 --> 01:08:12,520
Se Chan.

1779
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,830
(Se Chan's name is on the leaf.)

1780
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:16,860
(He has 2 votes.)

1781
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,089
I wonder who they are.

1782
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,460
Next...

1783
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,900
- is Se Chan. - What?

1784
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:23,500
What? Wait.

1785
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,040
1, 2, 3. Jong Kook wrote my name too.

1786
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
(With 3 votes, Se Chan leads the poll.)

1787
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,239
(Ji Hyo listened to Han Na and voted for Se Chan.)

1788
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,009
(Jin Young took a leaf...)

1789
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:39,219
(and voted for Se Chan too.)

1790
01:08:39,219 --> 01:08:42,389
(You can pay, Se Chan.)

1791
01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:46,290
- Who has the most votes? - Can I spin the roulette?

1792
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:47,560
- Se Chan. - Sure.

1793
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,230
- I won't feel as bad. - Hold on.

1794
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,690
You never know.

1795
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,759
(Se Chan gets 4 spaces, Han Na gets 3, and Haha gets 2.)

1796
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,199
(People who didn't get voted take 1 space each.)

1797
01:08:56,369 --> 01:08:57,529
Han Na and I are almost equal, right?

1798
01:08:57,529 --> 01:08:58,569
(Se Chan spins the fateful roulette that will cost 523 dollars.)

1799
01:08:58,569 --> 01:08:59,839
- I'll go. - You never know.

1800
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,339
(Se Chan spins the fateful roulette that will cost 523 dollars.)

1801
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:07,080
(Han Na with three spaces?)

1802
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:10,750
(Se Chan with four spaces? Or Haha with two spaces?)

1803
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,049
It's Jong Kook.

1804
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:16,789
(Kim Jong Kook)

1805
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:20,060
(He only had one space, but he gets picked.)

1806
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,320
That was awesome.

1807
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,690
I had a feeling you would pay.

1808
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,230
That was awesome.

1809
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,929
(Why me?)

1810
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:33,400
Jong Kook, please write down 523 dollars in your bankbook.

1811
01:09:33,639 --> 01:09:35,639
You got so lucky, Se Chan.

1812
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,240
- 500... - He's a lucky guy.

1813
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,009
- 20... - We used so much of his money.

1814
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:41,780
- Three. - Let's use his money.

1815
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,610
(He gets unlucky and has to pay 523 dollars.)

1816
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,919
The hotel feels...

1817
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:49,150
so stable. It feels like a family home.

1818
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,049
- It feels like a family home. - I'm not sure.

1819
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:53,820
Look at my hair. It's flat.

1820
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:54,959
What's wrong with your hair?

1821
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:56,629
Did you draw that on with a marker?

1822
01:09:56,629 --> 01:10:00,129
I didn't wash my hair for 24 hours.

1823
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,230
- Mine's flat too. - My hair is itchy.

1824
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,530
- Look at his too. - What's this?

1825
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,139
He took it off, and it smells like lamb.

1826
01:10:07,139 --> 01:10:10,339
(Seok Jin smells like lamb.)

1827
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:11,770
- Stop lying. - I'm serious.

1828
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:13,410
- You can't smell it. - You smell like lamb.

1829
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,910
- I can tell. - Let me see.

1830
01:10:15,009 --> 01:10:16,749
- Stop lying. I don't smell. - Really?

1831
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:17,950
- Oh, gosh. - I'm serious.

1832
01:10:19,879 --> 01:10:22,919
(He can smell lamb.)

1833
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:24,320
Stop lying.

1834
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,289
His face turned red.

1835
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,560
- His face turned red. - Smell it.

1836
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,690
- Smell it. - Don't do it.

1837
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,959
Take your caps off and smell yourselves.

1838
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:35,969
- I don't smell. - I don't think...

1839
01:10:35,969 --> 01:10:37,070
(Sniffing)

1840
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,600
- I don't smell at all. - She kept on scratching her head.

1841
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,799
That's my habit.

1842
01:10:41,799 --> 01:10:43,610
- I don't smell. - That's your habit?

1843
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,879
- Smell her. - Try it, Kwang Soo.

1844
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:47,879
- I don't smell. - I'll be honest.

1845
01:10:47,879 --> 01:10:49,850
Okay. I don't smell.

1846
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:53,749
(He's shocked.)

1847
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,950
It's because I just scratched.

1848
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,990
I don't smell, Jae Seok.

1849
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:59,820
- That's not possible. - Jae Seok.

1850
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,259
- People smell. - I really don't.

1851
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,660
- I usually don't smell. - Why do we have to do this?

1852
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,999
I don't want to smell it anymore.

1853
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,299
You're too aggressive, so I don't want to.

1854
01:11:08,299 --> 01:11:09,669
Try here.

1855
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:12,169
Da Hee, I'm serious. It kind of smelled like poop.

1856
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:13,969
What?

1857
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,870
I'll be objective.

1858
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:17,740
- Don't try to fool around. - I won't lie.

1859
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,480
- Be serious. - Okay.

1860
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,709
(Goodness)

1861
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:25,650
(What is this smell?)

1862
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,980
I was serious.

1863
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:28,950
Da Hee, why do you think you don't smell?

1864
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:30,150
I wasn't joking.

1865
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,690
I don't smell.

1866
01:11:32,919 --> 01:11:34,259
- People smell. - Da Hee.

1867
01:11:34,259 --> 01:11:35,660
- People smell. - Why do you think you don't?

1868
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:38,530
My skin smells good...

1869
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:40,799
- like a baby's. - No.

1870
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,770
Why would you smell like a baby? You're 35.

1871
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,329
Why do you think you're a baby?

1872
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:48,169
- Take your caps off. - Why?

1873
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,539
Let's be natural. Don't try to be fake on TV.

1874
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,740
Is this natural?

1875
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,209
- Is this natural? - Don't touch your hair.

1876
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:57,650
- Don't touch your hair, So Min. - I can't tell.

1877
01:11:57,679 --> 01:11:58,980
- Don't touch your hair. - Do I smell?

1878
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:00,850
My hair usually doesn't smell.

1879
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,150
Oh, my gosh.

1880
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,650
- I don't smell. - What do you mean?

1881
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:07,089
You can't smell yourself.

1882
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,160
You don't know because it's yourself.

1883
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,959
Jae Seok is touching his hair.

1884
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:14,600
(Did you see him?)

1885
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,730
- I saw him. - You saw him, right?

1886
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:19,770
- I had a gap, so I put it together. - Hey.

1887
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,669
You know how handsome men touch their hair after showering?

1888
01:12:22,669 --> 01:12:23,940
(That's what it looked like.)

1889
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,780
(He was full of confidence.)

1890
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,910
That's what he did.

1891
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,709
(He's confident for nothing.)

1892
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:32,879
Goodness.

1893
01:12:32,879 --> 01:12:33,919
(He saw that.)

1894
01:12:33,919 --> 01:12:35,589
- It's late now. - Right.

1895
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:38,789
You have to go to bed for wing walking tomorrow.

1896
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:41,419
(It's 11:30pm right now.)

1897
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:46,499
(Who will be the 3 people to wing walk?)

1898
01:12:46,499 --> 01:12:48,799
This mission will be for 30 minutes.

1899
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,870
Here's the third mission before going to bed.

1900
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:53,270
It's called Your Silence.

1901
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:54,870
(The third mission is Your Silence.)

1902
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:59,079
You have to stay in the same room and be silent for 30 minutes.

1903
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:02,950
(You can't make a sound for 30 minutes.)

1904
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,579
Whenever you make a sound, you receive a penalty.

1905
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,419
At the end of 30 minutes, 3 people with the most penalties...

1906
01:13:08,419 --> 01:13:10,320
will get the badges.

1907
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,719
(3 people will get the wing walking badges.)

1908
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,389
We just don't make a sound, right?

1909
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,959
- I'm sure they'll try to interfere. - We'll start...

1910
01:13:18,389 --> 01:13:20,400
now.

1911
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,459
(30 minutes of silence starts now.)

1912
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,629
(Let's put our caps back on.)

1913
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,339
(All right.)

1914
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:28,799
(Slapping)

1915
01:13:28,799 --> 01:13:30,610
(Seok Jin attacks with his cap.)

1916
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,480
(Okay.)

1917
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,179
(Pushing)

1918
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:39,249
(Jae Seok starts pinching Seok Jin's thigh.)

1919
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:41,780
(He makes a sound.)

1920
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:43,249
Seok Jin is out.

1921
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,759
(We'll see once I get back.)

1922
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,089
(This is why it's difficult.)

1923
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:54,030
(Seok Jin gets directed to the penalty room.)

1924
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,030
What is the penalty?

1925
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,169
(What is the penalty?)

1926
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:01,839
(Everybody is still quiet.)

1927
01:14:01,839 --> 01:14:04,570
(I'm going to the restroom.)

1928
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:05,679
(Stepping)

1929
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,009
(He steps on Kwang Soo's foot.)

1930
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:14,049
(Kwang Soo just made a sound.)

1931
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,520
Kwang Soo is out.

1932
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,289
(Me?)

1933
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:20,959
(She's about to laugh.)

1934
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,089
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1935
01:14:24,990 --> 01:14:27,759
(Me? Fine.)

1936
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,329
(You scared me.)

1937
01:14:31,499 --> 01:14:33,999
(I already have 6.)

1938
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:36,539
(Okay.)

1939
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:41,110
(Kwang Soo goes to the penalty room as well.)

1940
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:43,780
(Should I try something on him?)

1941
01:14:45,049 --> 01:14:48,990
(She tickles him.)

1942
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,089
(Laughing)

1943
01:14:51,089 --> 01:14:52,419
Jae Seok is out. Da Hee is out.

1944
01:14:52,419 --> 01:14:53,459
- What? - She laughed.

1945
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:54,520
I thought it was just three people.

1946
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,089
(She didn't understand the rules.)

1947
01:14:57,389 --> 01:14:58,490
(She thought only 3 people would get penalties.)

1948
01:14:58,490 --> 01:14:59,560
You just spoke.

1949
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,829
(She thought only 3 people would get penalties.)

1950
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:03,669
- What's going on? - It goes on for 30 minutes.

1951
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:04,969
(You need to be silent for 30 minutes.)

1952
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:06,969
Wasn't it just for three people?

1953
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,039
(Da Hee and Jae Seok leave.)

1954
01:15:09,339 --> 01:15:10,370
What is this?

1955
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,969
(We did well.)

1956
01:15:11,969 --> 01:15:13,709
(What?)

1957
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:17,450
(We did really good.)

1958
01:15:17,450 --> 01:15:19,219
(He cracks up.)

1959
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,549
(Here he is.)

1960
01:15:21,549 --> 01:15:25,350
(He's back.)

1961
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,789
(It's a landmine of laughter.)

1962
01:15:30,889 --> 01:15:33,030
(Sang Yeob gets the penalty.)

1963
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:35,900
(They both laugh.)

1964
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,370
(As a penalty, you get funny face paintings.)

1965
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:39,499
That one's bad.

1966
01:15:39,499 --> 01:15:41,539
(As a penalty, you get funny face paintings.)

1967
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:44,810
(She tries to hold it.)

1968
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:47,639
(I think I just saw something terrible.)

1969
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,009
(I have to take a picture of this.)

1970
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:53,820
(So Min is having fun.)

1971
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,749
(Go away.)

1972
01:15:57,450 --> 01:16:00,459
(Laughing)

1973
01:16:00,919 --> 01:16:02,560
(Do I look that funny?)

1974
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,860
(Look at this.)

1975
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:09,530
(This is the class of laughter mine.)

1976
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,100
(Kwang Soo is back too.)

1977
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,969
(He looks silly.)

1978
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:17,870
(He looks silly.)

1979
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:19,339
(Look at this, Kwang Soo.)

1980
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,509
(What is it?)

1981
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:23,310
(Laughing)

1982
01:16:24,749 --> 01:16:27,719
(It's Seok Jin Attack.)

1983
01:16:28,749 --> 01:16:34,490
(As soon as you see the picture, it makes you laugh.)

1984
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,860
(Kwang Soo gets the penalty as soon as he comes back.)

1985
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,530
(Goodness)

1986
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,969
(I can't stop laughing at it.)

1987
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,400
(How is it? Show me.)

1988
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:49,009
(She makes a sound.)

1989
01:16:49,009 --> 01:16:50,469
(She tries to hold it in.)

1990
01:16:50,469 --> 01:16:52,039
(Exploding)

1991
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,280
(It's Seok Jin Attack round 2.)

1992
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,879
Look at this.

1993
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,919
I have to show it to everybody.

1994
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:01,020
What do I do?

1995
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,749
(Do I look that funny?)

1996
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,289
Go.

1997
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:07,889
(So Min gets the penalty as well from Seok Jin Attack.)

1998
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,459
(He's left alone.)

1999
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,060
(He's here.)

2000
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:18,700
(Jae Seok has a pointy nose.)

2001
01:17:19,339 --> 01:17:21,240
(That one's intense.)

2002
01:17:22,209 --> 01:17:26,310
(I went inside, and they made my nose pointy.)

2003
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:28,839
(I have to take a picture of this.)

2004
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,179
(He can't help but turn on his camera.)

2005
01:17:32,179 --> 01:17:33,980
(He looks haughty.)

2006
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,089
(They have the best looks on Running Man.)

2007
01:17:38,289 --> 01:17:41,589
(If somebody comes in, let's attack them with the picture.)

2008
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:44,889
(Da Hee is back as well.)

2009
01:17:46,259 --> 01:17:49,230
(She's a man with red cheeks.)

2010
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:50,329
(I won't laugh this time.)

2011
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,200
(Is Da Hee back?)

2012
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,009
(Jae Seok, our picture looks too funny.)

2013
01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:00,839
(I can hold it in.)

2014
01:18:00,839 --> 01:18:02,850
(She makes a sound.)

2015
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,780
(She can't.)

2016
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,620
(I have to hold it in.)

2017
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,749
- Da Hee is out. - You're out.

2018
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:09,889
What?

2019
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:13,520
What's this? What's wrong with Jae Seok?

2020
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,990
- Da Hee is back. - Oh, gosh.

2021
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,289
Why? What did you see?

2022
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:19,900
(She laughs too easily. It's almost automatic.)

2023
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,259
- I can't do this. - You're sweating.

2024
01:18:21,759 --> 01:18:23,629
I can't do this.

2025
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,940
I'll make them laugh.

2026
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,039
(She paints her own face.)

2027
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:28,100
I have to make them laugh.

2028
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,810
I have to send them away.

2029
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,110
(Seok Jin is making the staff laugh.)

2030
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:39,419
(It's a double laughter mine.)

2031
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:41,719
(How is it? It's good, right?)

2032
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:45,049
(Let's make the others laugh with this.)

2033
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:48,190
(This is their new target.)

2034
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,959
(It's the silly man with a unibrow.)

2035
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:53,400
(Kwang Soo,)

2036
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,759
(look at this.)

2037
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,530
(He attacks with a silly dance.)

2038
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,539
(He barely survives.)

2039
01:19:02,639 --> 01:19:05,039
(Do you want to see this then?)

2040
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:09,679
(This is the stronger 2nd attack.)

2041
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,650
(Trembling)

2042
01:19:13,419 --> 01:19:16,520
(He's about to explode.)

2043
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,889
(The picture is right in front of him.)

2044
01:19:19,389 --> 01:19:21,690
(He tries not to look.)

2045
01:19:22,789 --> 01:19:25,600
(He manages to control himself.)

2046
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:28,100
(He's good.)

2047
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:29,370
(That was close.)

2048
01:19:30,169 --> 01:19:35,070
(What is wrong with you two?)

2049
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:37,339
(He controlled himself,)

2050
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:38,709
(but So Min is here.)

2051
01:19:39,339 --> 01:19:42,480
(She's Hong Doo Kkae's wife.)

2052
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,910
(He bursts out laughing.)

2053
01:19:45,749 --> 01:19:47,919
(He laughs out loud.)

2054
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,419
(Jae Seok gets the penalty again.)

2055
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:51,650
(He cracks up.)

2056
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:56,329
(Laughter is contagious.)

2057
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,160
(She thinks he looks funny too.)

2058
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,499
So Min is out.

2059
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,299
I have to show him the picture. There's a funny one.

2060
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,129
Was this necessary?

2061
01:20:05,499 --> 01:20:06,770
Was this necessary?

2062
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,370
I can't laugh. I can't.

2063
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:09,539
(Jae Seok and So Min both enter the penalty room.)

2064
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,810
(We survived.)

2065
01:20:13,579 --> 01:20:15,209
(Let's be good. I have 2 badges.)

2066
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,350
(I have 6.)

2067
01:20:18,879 --> 01:20:20,280
(She leaves the penalty room again.)

2068
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,350
(Sighing)

2069
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:26,020
(She wasn't able to...)

2070
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,219
(hold in her laughter so far.)

2071
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:32,329
(I'm going to control myself and overcome it this time.)

2072
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:35,730
(She's determined.)

2073
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,169
(Giggling)

2074
01:20:38,299 --> 01:20:41,070
(It's automatic again.)

2075
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,969
(Hold it in. I can do it.)

2076
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,469
(Da Hee, do you want to see this?)

2077
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:47,410
(This is a challenge for her.)

2078
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:50,310
(This is her biggest crisis.)

2079
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,350
(She makes a sound.)

2080
01:20:52,150 --> 01:20:53,280
(She laughs again.)

2081
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,280
(She's about to cry.)

2082
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,450
I can't do this.

2083
01:20:59,089 --> 01:21:02,289
(This picture is very effective.)

2084
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,600
(A cute, drunk man...)

2085
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,469
(and Hong Doo Kkae's wife with glasses are here.)

2086
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:12,799
(Let's take a selfie.)

2087
01:21:12,799 --> 01:21:14,570
(Say cheese.)

2088
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,209
(They attack each other...)

2089
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:20,509
(and try to...)

2090
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:23,749
(hold their laughter in.)

2091
01:21:23,773 --> 01:21:27,673
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E406 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

2092
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:31,549
(I can't.)

2093
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:33,419
(What's that?)

2094
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:37,629
(He got plastic surgeries on his nose and eyes.)

2095
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:41,829
(It's a laughter attack.)

2096
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:47,169
(This is the worst crisis for them since the start of the mission.)

2097
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:50,009
(He's happy and proud.)

2098
01:21:51,070 --> 01:21:53,810
(Calm yourselves. Let's take a selfie.)

2099
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:58,509
(Thanks to calm Sang Yeob, they take a selfie.)

2100
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,120
(They pose like models.)

2101
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:03,190
(We're wing walking tomorrow.)

2102
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,389
(Look here, Jae Seok.)

2103
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,990
(What are we doing?)

2104
01:22:09,089 --> 01:22:14,230
(They're trying to take a group photo.)

2105
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,870
(Giggling)

2106
01:22:16,629 --> 01:22:19,070
(That was an unexpected attack.)

2107
01:22:20,740 --> 01:22:24,169
Why are you standing next to me? Why were you there?

2108
01:22:24,169 --> 01:22:25,339
(Why were you standing there?)

2109
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,480
(He's happy.)

2110
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,950
(Peeking)

2111
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,749
(Giggling)

2112
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:33,249
(He cracks up.)

2113
01:22:33,249 --> 01:22:35,419
Kwang Soo is out.

2114
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:37,289
(Go, Kwang Soo.)

2115
01:22:37,749 --> 01:22:39,660
(I'm going to pretend like I can't see anything.)

2116
01:22:40,459 --> 01:22:42,190
Take him away.

2117
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,259
Go. This is not fair.

2118
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:46,429
(His face is not fair.)

2119
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,360
He has to erase that and start all over again.

2120
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:52,240
(The storm passes by.)

2121
01:22:52,999 --> 01:22:55,169
(He checks his handsome face.)

2122
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,209
(Let's give Jae Seok another penalty.)

2123
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,509
(She removes the tape.)

2124
01:23:02,379 --> 01:23:04,379
(That was unexpected.)

2125
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:05,749
(Groaning)

2126
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:06,749
That was good.

2127
01:23:06,749 --> 01:23:08,850
(Was it that painful?)

2128
01:23:09,589 --> 01:23:12,289
(Jae Seok gets another penalty.)

2129
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,160
Hey.

2130
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:16,589
You almost ripped my nose out.

2131
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,499
I can't believe her.

2132
01:23:20,499 --> 01:23:22,870
(The handsome man who lost his nose goes to the penalty room again.)

2133
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,839
(Meanwhile, in the penalty room)

2134
01:23:26,839 --> 01:23:30,339
(Kwang Soo finishes receiving a nose job as well.)

2135
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:35,139
(Kwang Soo's nose is taped like Jae Seok's.)

2136
01:23:35,139 --> 01:23:37,280
(So Min finds her new target.)

2137
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:40,150
(Why don't you sit down for a second?)

2138
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:43,150
(Why?)

2139
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:44,620
(Shouting)

2140
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,520
(They succeed in removing his nose bridge.)

2141
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:51,990
(Kwang Soo ends up making a noise as soon as he comes back.)

2142
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:57,530
(They can't believe they did it again.)

2143
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,700
(I want to stop going to the penalty room.)

2144
01:24:01,499 --> 01:24:04,139
(When the atmosphere is calm,)

2145
01:24:04,139 --> 01:24:06,509
(the one who can't stop laughing comes in.)

2146
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,709
(I refuse to laugh this time.)

2147
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:12,450
(Let's go make her laugh.)

2148
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,450
(So Min attacks with a picture.)

2149
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:19,060
(She suddenly collapses.)

2150
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,990
(Da Hee trips over a bag because her eyes are shut.)

2151
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:24,530
(Da Hee, take a look.)

2152
01:24:25,389 --> 01:24:29,230
(They surround her.)

2153
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,339
(Peeking)

2154
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:34,700
(Laughing)

2155
01:24:34,700 --> 01:24:36,969
(It has begun.)

2156
01:24:36,969 --> 01:24:38,209
My goodness.

2157
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:41,509
Hey, I am out of ideas now.

2158
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,679
Hey.

2159
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,780
She is out.

2160
01:24:45,919 --> 01:24:48,350
(Peek-a-boo)

2161
01:24:49,249 --> 01:24:50,320
(What do you think of my trash can hat?)

2162
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:51,620
(Laughing)

2163
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:53,360
(That's a nice reaction.)

2164
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,990
I don't know what to do. I won't do this. I won't do this.

2165
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,160
Gosh, I hate So Min.

2166
01:25:01,030 --> 01:25:02,770
The game has ended.

2167
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,329
- Okay. - The game has ended.

2168
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,139
It's over.

2169
01:25:06,139 --> 01:25:07,440
(Your Silence finally ends.)

2170
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,009
- I barely suppressed my laughter. - The game has ended.

2171
01:25:10,009 --> 01:25:11,139
That was incredible.

2172
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:15,240
(Why aren't they coming out?)

2173
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:21,650
(The avatar version of Kwang Soo counterattacks.)

2174
01:25:23,089 --> 01:25:26,889
I have to take a picture. I have to take a picture.

2175
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,160
This is incredible.

2176
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:33,129
- You are too late. It's over. - Is it over?

2177
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:34,129
(What are you saying?)

2178
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,900
- Why is it over? - It's over.

2179
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:37,270
Why is it over?

2180
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,829
- It's over. - It's not over.

2181
01:25:38,999 --> 01:25:40,870
- No. - Is it over?

2182
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,610
- Is it really over? - It's over. Look over here.

2183
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:47,139
- Look over here. - Let's take a picture together.

2184
01:25:47,879 --> 01:25:49,110
Let's take a picture together.

2185
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,749
- Is it over? - It's over.

2186
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,009
Is it over?

2187
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:55,280
(The handsome man also finds out that the game is over.)

2188
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,719
Why did it end so soon?

2189
01:25:57,219 --> 01:25:58,589
(Disappointed)

2190
01:25:58,589 --> 01:25:59,620
I mean...

2191
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,629
- You look scary. - Look at this.

2192
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,789
(My makeup is funny.)

2193
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,829
(Is it over?)

2194
01:26:08,259 --> 01:26:09,969
This is too much.

2195
01:26:10,929 --> 01:26:13,570
- I will announce the results. - I went in two times.

2196
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,469
- Da Hee... - She went in five times.

2197
01:26:17,169 --> 01:26:19,509
- She went in a lot. - She has many badges now.

2198
01:26:19,539 --> 01:26:21,009
We don't know how this will end.

2199
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:24,280
Kwang Soo went in four times.

2200
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,450
(Kwang Soo gets 2 badges.)

2201
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:28,579
Even if I get many badges, there is no hope for you.

2202
01:26:29,249 --> 01:26:32,120
I can't tell how you are feeling.

2203
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:34,219
- I am making an angry face. - Let me see your face.

2204
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,530
- You don't look angry. - I am angry.

2205
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:38,690
He's in a good mood.

2206
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:40,360
- I think he is in a good mood. - Am I second to last?

2207
01:26:40,429 --> 01:26:42,469
Can't you hold in your laughter?

2208
01:26:42,969 --> 01:26:45,169
You are worse. You went away the most often.

2209
01:26:45,169 --> 01:26:47,700
(She's an automatic laughing machine.)

2210
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,610
You really can't hold in your laughter.

2211
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,480
This is too much.

2212
01:26:52,539 --> 01:26:54,280
Even a little snort...

2213
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:56,980
was counted as a sound.

2214
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,980
I once got dragged away because I farted.

2215
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,980
- He deserved it. - I once got dragged away...

2216
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,650
- because my stomach grumbled. - Her stomach grumbled.

2217
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,820
(So this is Running Man.)

2218
01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,660
The person who will receive one badge...

2219
01:27:07,690 --> 01:27:09,589
for going to the penalty room three times is Jae Seok.

2220
01:27:09,589 --> 01:27:10,690
(Jae Seok gets 1 badge.)

2221
01:27:10,690 --> 01:27:12,129
- My goodness. - This is ridiculous.

2222
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:15,429
I don't know why we are doing this in the UK.

2223
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:17,969
- I am in tears. - I didn't know I would do this.

2224
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:19,400
I laughed so much today.

2225
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,870
Kwang Soo, are you angry right now?

2226
01:27:21,139 --> 01:27:22,839
- Right now? - I can't tell his current mood.

2227
01:27:22,839 --> 01:27:24,009
I am smiling right now.

2228
01:27:24,009 --> 01:27:25,039
(I guess you can't see it.)

2229
01:27:25,339 --> 01:27:26,740
(Unlike his angry expression,)

2230
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:28,440
(you can see his teeth.)

2231
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,650
How are you feeling? Are you in a good mood?

2232
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:33,150
- This is hilarious. - What do you think?

2233
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:36,919
- Put yourself in my shoes. - Your expression is...

2234
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,860
Nothing good happened today. Why would I be in a good mood?

2235
01:27:40,919 --> 01:27:43,389
I ended up with eight badges and blue paint on my face.

2236
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,860
I can't believe you.

2237
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:49,329
Look at you.

2238
01:27:49,329 --> 01:27:50,329
(I know you had a hard day.)

2239
01:27:50,329 --> 01:27:51,870
(Ripping)

2240
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,539
(He removes Jae Seok's nose bridge.)

2241
01:27:58,009 --> 01:28:00,839
My nose is gone. My nose is gone, right?

2242
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,450
My nose is gone, right? Is it bleeding?

2243
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,650
My nose is gone. I felt it.

2244
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,950
- Isn't that your nose? - My nose is gone.

2245
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,020
- My goodness. - My nose is gone.

2246
01:28:09,089 --> 01:28:11,389
My nose got ripped off. Look at the tape.

2247
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,820
Are you smiling?

2248
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:16,129
- I am smiling. - I think he is smiling.

2249
01:28:16,129 --> 01:28:17,929
I am smiling.

2250
01:28:18,230 --> 01:28:21,030
Now, Round Three came to an end.

2251
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:23,969
Tomorrow morning, we will have Round Four.

2252
01:28:23,969 --> 01:28:25,900
Would that be necessary? It's over for Kwang Soo.

2253
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:26,900
(It's over for Kwang Soo.)

2254
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:29,709
- No one can beat him. - Tell Kwang Soo to rest tomorrow.

2255
01:28:29,709 --> 01:28:32,139
- He has so many badges. - How many badges do you have?

2256
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:34,709
- How many badges do you have? - Eight.

2257
01:28:34,709 --> 01:28:37,249
(Kwang Soo is at the very bottom after getting 8 badges in 1 day.)

2258
01:28:37,249 --> 01:28:39,150
- Stay cool-headed. - He's really unlucky.

2259
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:42,950
If we don't wrap up soon, Kwang Soo's skin will be blue...

2260
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,320
- even after he washes his face. - You're right.

2261
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,620
His face is really blue.

2262
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:47,419
This paint might not come off.

2263
01:28:47,419 --> 01:28:49,259
I want to laugh, but I can't.

2264
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:53,160
The paint hardened. It really did.

2265
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,530
Let's wrap up quickly for Kwang Soo.

2266
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,600
Please go to your rooms and rest.

2267
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,440
(The 3 people who will wing walk will be revealed next week.)

2268
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:02,709
(It's time for skiing.)

2269
01:29:02,709 --> 01:29:04,509
(Let's go and ski.)

2270
01:29:04,509 --> 01:29:07,910
(They dreamed of skiing on the Alps.)

2271
01:29:08,379 --> 01:29:10,780
(However)

2272
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,009
(What is going on?)

2273
01:29:12,009 --> 01:29:13,350
(It will be over if we get hit by lightning.)

2274
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:17,749
(The luxurious trip encounters an unexpected hardship.)

2275
01:29:17,749 --> 01:29:19,419
(An emergency meeting is held.)

2276
01:29:19,419 --> 01:29:21,120
(What will become of Team Luxury?)

2277
01:29:23,429 --> 01:29:24,889
(They can't run away.)

2278
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,959
(They can't avoid it.)

2279
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,629
(The last mission to choose 3 people)

2280
01:29:33,299 --> 01:29:34,940
(Finally)

2281
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:39,839
(The worst penalty in the history of variety programs shows itself.)

2282
01:29:39,839 --> 01:29:43,150
(The unfortunate member climbs onto the wing.)

2283
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:47,450
(The penalty shocks everyone.)

2284
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:50,719
(Who will be the 3 people to climb onto the wing?)

2285
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:54,089
(The Unfinished War)
