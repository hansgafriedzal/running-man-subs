1
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:06,755
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:09,915
(Shuddering and Luxury Packages left for their respective countries.)

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,010
(It was decided that only 3 people would wing walk.)

4
00:00:14,017 --> 00:00:17,380
(Penalty badges are given after each mission.)

5
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:20,950
(The number of the badges determines the size of the Pirate Roulette.)

6
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:25,490
(The 1st 3 people who make the pirate pop up get the penalty.)

7
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:29,435
(You must win to avoid wing walking.)

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,900
(With 8 badges, Kwang Soo has a high chance of wing walking.)

9
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,045
(He's the leading candidate.)

10
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,915
(Luxurious Switzerland)

11
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,645
(Do Everything You Want to Do)

12
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:44,925
(Select additional tours, and enjoy everything.)

13
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:47,380
(However, the cost of additional tours...)

14
00:00:47,384 --> 00:00:50,365
(must come from the members.)

15
00:00:51,288 --> 00:00:54,720
(Enjoy the luxuries...)

16
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:56,760
(and choose who will pay for the expenses.)

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,420
(After each tour, an anonymous poll is conducted.)

18
00:00:58,428 --> 00:01:02,835
(If you are on a ballot, you get your name written on the roulette.)

19
00:01:03,066 --> 00:01:05,300
(The member to pay for the scenic tour is...)

20
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,970
(Kim Jong Kook.)

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,000
(Jong Kook paid 523 dollars.)

22
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:10,970
No way.

23
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:12,600
(After the first payment that was tainted with betrayals)

24
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,640
The observatory hotel in Switzerland...

25
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:16,940
is so popular that even the Swiss find it hard...

26
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,680
to visit in their lifetime.

27
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:21,280
Only two members...

28
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:22,380
(Only two members...)

29
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:25,380
will be able to stay at the hotel and have a stargazing experience.

30
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:26,565
Experience? Okay.

31
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:31,190
(The hotel is a remodeled observatory...)

32
00:01:31,194 --> 00:01:34,235
(that lets its guests enjoy the festival of the stars.)

33
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:37,075
(Only two members are invited to the fantastic night.)

34
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,175
- Let's go. - Let's go.

35
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:42,315
- See you tomorrow. - Let's see what happens tomorrow.

36
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:43,500
See you tomorrow.

37
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:44,870
(Haha and Se Chan are chosen.)

38
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,745
Bye.

39
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,040
- Bye. - Bye.

40
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:52,655
- Bye. - Enjoy stargazing.

41
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:56,595
Bye. Come again.

42
00:01:57,854 --> 00:02:00,150
- Bye. - Bye.

43
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:01,450
(Don't forget about us.)

44
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,735
- Bye. - Come again.

45
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:08,160
If the sky clears up,

46
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:11,160
we will have an experience money can't buy.

47
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,305
You are right.

48
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,945
- That's where we will stargaze. - Over there.

49
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:16,700
The dome will open.

50
00:02:16,706 --> 00:02:19,845
(When the dome that remains closed during the day opens at night,)

51
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:23,955
(you can enjoy the paintings space has created.)

52
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,810
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

53
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:29,080
It's nice to meet you. Welcome.

54
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,465
- Hello. - Hello.

55
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,950
Would you ask her if the hotel has hot water?

56
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:36,020
- Would you? - Of course it has hot water.

57
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:38,960
Ask her if the hotel has hot water.

58
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:42,260
All of these mountains written on the doors are around us.

59
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:44,160
- This peak must be the highest one. - That's right.

60
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,330
- 4,219m. - Matterhorn is higher.

61
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:48,270
This is your room.

62
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,370
(The view is amazing.)

63
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:52,285
You can see Matterhorn.

64
00:02:53,576 --> 00:02:54,670
(They see the Alps outside the window.)

65
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:57,485
We can take pictures here.

66
00:02:57,814 --> 00:03:01,225
It will feel amazing to wake up to this kind of energy.

67
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:04,425
- How does it look? - The clouds are gone.

68
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:08,350
- It's a good day for paragliding. - This is nice.

69
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,050
The weather is pretty nice.

70
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:12,120
Since we don't have much time, we will explain quickly.

71
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:15,235
They will only allow three people to paraglide.

72
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:18,500
- One of you won't get to paraglide. - Okay.

73
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:19,905
Please choose who will paraglide among yourselves.

74
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:23,700
(Han Na, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo decide to paraglide.)

75
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:27,215
(Jin Young decides to sit out since she is afraid of heights.)

76
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,410
- Are you okay? - I am okay.

77
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:31,225
- Is your heart beating fast? - My heart is beating very fast.

78
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,480
Let's go.

79
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:37,080
(It's not every day you get to fly over the Alps.)

80
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,750
- Let's go. - Follow me.

81
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,150
- Okay. - Let's go.

82
00:03:40,156 --> 00:03:42,335
Matterhorn, here I come!

83
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,390
I will see the views of Switzerland from the sky.

84
00:03:46,396 --> 00:03:48,160
- Are you okay? - I am okay.

85
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:50,375
I feel scared now. What should I do?

86
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:51,630
(She feels scared now that it's time to go.)

87
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:53,230
I feel scared now.

88
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:55,015
- I feel scared. - My goodness.

89
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:59,485
(Her heart beats fast.)

90
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:03,810
Ji Hyo, how are you feeling at this moment?

91
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:05,480
Do you feel like you are on a boat?

92
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,680
- My lips are dry. - Do you feel motion sickness?

93
00:04:07,684 --> 00:04:09,380
- Yes. I can't breathe. - You can't breathe?

94
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,180
I will perform a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

95
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:14,050
(A mouth-to-mouth resuscitation)

96
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:16,590
I can't see well. Where am I?

97
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:19,120
- Take off your sunglasses. - Should I do that?

98
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:20,375
(Take off your sunglasses.)

99
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,760
That must be the starting line.

100
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:23,905
(Let's get ready.)

101
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,130
Do I need to walk? Not now?

102
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,615
(Han Na is the first one to take the runway.)

103
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:32,170
Okay. Run. Go, go, go, go.

104
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:34,610
- Run? - Go, go, go.

105
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:40,080
(She overcomes her nervousness and takes off.)

106
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,395
(She is smiling from ear to ear.)

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,350
(My goodness.)

108
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:47,795
So beautiful!

109
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,035
It's so beautiful.

110
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:54,005
I now see why people put this...

111
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:57,975
on their bucket lists. It's beautiful.

112
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:02,215
We are coming closer to Matterhorn.

113
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:07,115
(Matterhorn looks like it's within reach.)

114
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,540
(She is happy to see Matterhorn on a clear day.)

115
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:13,285
I feel like I became a bird.

116
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,750
(She is like a small bird in the grand nature.)

117
00:05:18,755 --> 00:05:20,095
Ji Hyo's in the air.

118
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,560
(Ji Hyo takes off.)

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,660
(Screaming)

120
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:27,905
Mom!

121
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,905
(Screaming)

122
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,230
(This dutiful daughter only looks for her mom at times like this.)

123
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:37,640
(Mom, what's all this?)

124
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,845
Oh, my gosh.

125
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:43,115
(This out-of-the-world scenery makes her become speechless.)

126
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,225
(I'm on top of the world!)

127
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:59,305
(The Queen of the Alps might receive her even if she flies too closely.)

128
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,890
Amazing!

129
00:06:00,897 --> 00:06:03,305
- Amazing. - Amazing!

130
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,630
I believe I can fly

131
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:10,570
I believe I can touch the sky

132
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:12,085
(This incredible scenery makes his old sentiments come out.)

133
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,610
(They start flying together...)

134
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,540
(while flying along the golden sunset of Matterhorn.)

135
00:06:16,546 --> 00:06:18,285
Ji Hyo!

136
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,110
- Okay. - Ji Hyo!

137
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:21,550
(Hello, Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

138
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,055
Jong Kook.

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,925
- Hello! - Hello.

140
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:29,090
I can see Zermatt under my feet.

141
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:30,150
(With the same scenery, height, and heart,)

142
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,860
(they finish their picnic in the sky...)

143
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,090
(and glide down.)

144
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,335
My gosh.

145
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,475
(That was really awesome.)

146
00:06:40,837 --> 00:06:41,900
Thank you.

147
00:06:41,904 --> 00:06:43,740
(Bumping)

148
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,540
- Thank you. - Okay.

149
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,840
(She smiles even after landing on her bottom.)

150
00:06:46,843 --> 00:06:48,155
Can I get up?

151
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:52,755
(Getting teary-eyed)

152
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:54,495
That was amazing!

153
00:06:54,884 --> 00:06:56,695
My gosh, that was utterly amazing.

154
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:00,390
(Trotting)

155
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,835
Han Na, how was it?

156
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:04,705
Wasn't it amazing? Wasn't it incredible?

157
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,520
Ji Hyo is really hyper.

158
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,560
(Her excitement is still evident.)

159
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,490
- Jong Kook, how was it? Amazing? - It was incredible.

160
00:07:09,499 --> 00:07:11,805
- We flew in the sky. - We were really flying.

161
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,530
- Jong Kook, we really flew. - Seriously.

162
00:07:14,537 --> 00:07:15,900
(With the overwhelming feeling of paragliding,)

163
00:07:15,905 --> 00:07:19,145
(they head into the city center in Zermatt to their lodging.)

164
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:21,310
- Jong Kook, are you happy? - Yes?

165
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,470
Of course.

166
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,480
- You look filthy rich right now. - Me?

167
00:07:25,481 --> 00:07:26,910
(You look filthy rich right now.)

168
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,325
Right now, you look...

169
00:07:29,452 --> 00:07:32,350
- I look rich? - young, rich, tall, and handsome.

170
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,690
- "Young, rich, tall, and handsome"? - You do.

171
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:38,860
- No one travels with three women. - Rich?

172
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm good with looking rich.

173
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,305
- Is it here? - Where?

174
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,260
Here?

175
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,275
(Our lodging is here.)

176
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,430
- "Plaza"? What's that? - My goodness.

177
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:50,130
(A 5-star, luxurious hotel in Provence style)

178
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,070
- Hold on. Is that a 5-star hotel? - Great. It is a 5-star hotel.

179
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:55,655
We have to eat breakfast tomorrow.

180
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,685
I'd like that.

181
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,480
We must check out the rooms.

182
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,110
(Humming)

183
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,725
We must check out the rooms.

184
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:04,950
(Unbelievable. I can't believe this is our room!)

185
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:06,550
- No way. - This is a room?

186
00:08:06,556 --> 00:08:08,165
- Oh, my gosh. - There's a song.

187
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,290
This is amazing.

188
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,620
(It's an antique and luxurious room with 2 floors.)

189
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,890
- Really? This is our room? - I just got goosebumps.

190
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:17,130
- I mean, Matterhorn... My gosh. - This is beautiful. Wait.

191
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:19,160
- I'm so shocked. - My gosh, look at this.

192
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,500
(It overlooks Zermatt's city center at a glance.)

193
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,975
- I should check the terrace. - I can hear the birds.

194
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,970
- Come out. You can hear the birds. - My gosh, I love the terrace.

195
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,740
Can you hear the birds chirping?

196
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:29,140
This is unbelievable.

197
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,180
(Imagine seeing this view and hearing the birds chirping.)

198
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,140
Hey, we could have a cup of coffee while admiring Matterhorn.

199
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,610
- That'd be great. - Tomorrow morning,

200
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,650
- We must. - we must wake up and have coffee...

201
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:37,680
while looking at Matterhorn.

202
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,365
- That's a must. - This is incredible.

203
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:43,220
(Night has fallen in this luxurious country, Switzerland.)

204
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:46,535
- There are stars, right? Please. - There has to be.

205
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:49,575
This place is amazing. What is this place?

206
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,830
- This is like a secret room. - Goodness, this place is awesome.

207
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:55,375
What is it? This looks like an attic, doesn't it?

208
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,140
- It's opening. - What's going?

209
00:08:58,141 --> 00:09:02,055
(There's an astronomical telescope, and the ceiling slowly opens up.)

210
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:07,125
("Mystical Space" is released at the theater closest to the sky.)

211
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,480
(My gosh, it's like we're watching "Transformers".)

212
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:11,765
Are you doing this just for us?

213
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:14,750
Really? This is one luxurious package indeed.

214
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:17,590
- It's a luxurious package. - It is. It is indeed.

215
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:19,235
(An astronomy professor is invited, and the dome opens just for them.)

216
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:25,175
(Time to meet the stars that they had been waiting for since Seoul)

217
00:09:26,002 --> 00:09:27,370
(A preliminary briefing with the professor)

218
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,500
(We took that photo from here.)

219
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:30,170
- Really? - Everything.

220
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:34,685
(I'll get to engrave the feast of bright lights in my eyes, right?)

221
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,540
Why can't I see the stars? Darn it.

222
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:40,725
(Why can't I see the stars?)

223
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,995
Haha, nothing is up there.

224
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:47,365
This is a bust. It's ruined.

225
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,865
Oh, no.

226
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,305
- Tim, there are no stars. - You'll get to see the stars.

227
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,460
When we turn off the lights, we can see them clearly.

228
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,005
- He turned the lights off. - My gosh.

229
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,400
(It's harder to see the stars now.)

230
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,975
But there are no stars.

231
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:06,885
- Where's the twinkling star? - Where... Where is it?

232
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,155
We can't see them at all.

233
00:10:09,412 --> 00:10:12,825
Tell him not to worry and that my wife's name...

234
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:15,755
means star in Korean.

235
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:17,380
(The interpreter is flustered.)

236
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:22,190
His wife's name means star. She's a singer as well.

237
00:10:22,191 --> 00:10:26,205
Very nice. Do you know what my biggest hobby is? It's singing.

238
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:30,230
Tim said that his favorite hobby is singing.

239
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:31,660
(He shares his hobby after hearing Haha's nonsense.)

240
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,245
- He's a singer too. - Can you sing one?

241
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:37,800
It goes something like this.

242
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:39,185
(I got an inspiration.)

243
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:43,570
Home lies behind, and the world is ahead

244
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,080
- My gosh. - My gosh, he's good.

245
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:49,080
(It's as if watching an opera with Tim's unexpected singing ability.)

246
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:53,250
(We didn't even ask him, but what's this song about?)

247
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:57,065
(Why is he singing this song for us?)

248
00:10:57,493 --> 00:11:02,635
(You remind me of this song. It's a song of the hobbits.)

249
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,375
(They feel moved without knowing what the song is about.)

250
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,745
- He's good. - I... I...

251
00:11:09,972 --> 00:11:12,340
That was so romantic. I almost cried.

252
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:14,970
Whenever the weather is bad, I come here and sing.

253
00:11:14,977 --> 00:11:18,440
- He's so good. - He usually comes here and sings.

254
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:19,980
I guess he wants to be a singer.

255
00:11:19,982 --> 00:11:22,625
(An encounter of the hobbits and the singer of the hobbits)

256
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:24,850
- Hold on. - This?

257
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:28,395
This is it. Hey, come here. Let's pretend that we saw this.

258
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,365
(They do look like they're in the galaxy as they stand there.)

259
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,405
- We must be precise. Move back. - What?

260
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:38,075
- Wait. Tighter. Bring it closer. - Hold on.

261
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,115
(They even put on the perfect facial expressions.)

262
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:44,745
("Starry Night")

263
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,310
(This does look pretty real.)

264
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,785
Haha, it looks real.

265
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,340
- This is it. - Our expressions are the same.

266
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,555
- This is good. - This is good. Thank you.

267
00:11:54,984 --> 00:11:57,520
I mean, we did come from far away.

268
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,050
- Exactly. - When...

269
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:02,020
When would we get to come here during the rest of our lives?

270
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,105
It's a waste. It really is.

271
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:08,135
It is a shame, but since we can't see them, we'll call it a night.

272
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,560
- I'm not sure... - Tomorrow morning...

273
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:14,145
if you'll use this clip or not when you edit.

274
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,230
When I came back from the bathroom, I couldn't find Se Chan.

275
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,740
(It was late at night.)

276
00:12:18,741 --> 00:12:20,200
With that view as the backdrop...

277
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,410
(The mountain was his backdrop.)

278
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,455
He was talking to someone on the phone.

279
00:12:24,647 --> 00:12:26,225
He was doing this gesture too.

280
00:12:26,849 --> 00:12:29,025
I'll stop here.

281
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:34,490
("Yang Se Chan Video Called Someone in Switzerland")

282
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:37,905
Come on. Why did you say that?

283
00:12:38,194 --> 00:12:39,860
I was wondering where you were going with that.

284
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:41,805
When I approached him, he suddenly said,

285
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,330
"Get away from here." That's what he said.

286
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,715
- I have my private life too. - This is it. I'll stop here.

287
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,015
I was recording a video. It was great.

288
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,085
He was so affectionate.

289
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,610
(My gosh, this joker...)

290
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,485
You must edit this part out.

291
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,155
You can't air this.

292
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,155
This is all I can say.

293
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:07,195
(He removes the microphone to avoid leaving comments.)

294
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,550
(You know that you must cut this out, right?)

295
00:13:09,558 --> 00:13:10,835
- You got that, right? - Hey.

296
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,435
- Let's get an exclusive. - No exclusive.

297
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,675
Haha, why did you say such a thing?

298
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:19,700
Goodnight.

299
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:21,815
(Ask the stars what really happened.)

300
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,500
(Team Shuddering Package's first night in the UK)

301
00:13:24,507 --> 00:13:26,170
You can wash up first.

302
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:29,555
Where is it? Da Hee, you can wash up first.

303
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:33,285
(The reckless sisters are about to wrap up their first night.)

304
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:39,780
(It looks like she has to wash up first before anyone else.)

305
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:41,235
My gosh, look at my face.

306
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,820
(Last night, during the crazy mission, Your Silence)

307
00:13:45,828 --> 00:13:49,960
(Whoever made a sound had to wear a disguise for this hard mission.)

308
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:53,360
(They weren't supposed to laugh, but it was impossible not to.)

309
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,915
(Wait and see. I'll make you laugh even more.)

310
00:13:58,407 --> 00:14:00,970
(The ultimate disguise showed up. Hello, So Min?)

311
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:04,280
(How was I supposed to beat that face?)

312
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,280
(She trudged back into the dressing room again.)

313
00:14:07,283 --> 00:14:11,180
(This was how this fancy-looking disguise came about.)

314
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,525
My gosh.

315
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,920
I don't have an ounce of energy.

316
00:14:15,925 --> 00:14:19,320
My ankle hurts. It really hurts.

317
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:22,030
(Her face is still funny now.)

318
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:24,800
With your hair up, your beard stands out more.

319
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,215
- I look so ugly, don't I? - The beard is too...

320
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:31,785
Actually, I wasn't going to wash my hair until tomorrow.

321
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:36,885
I got a blow-dry and curled my hair at the hair salon.

322
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:40,980
I was going to keep this hair style if the curls were still intact.

323
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:44,450
But you guys smelled my hair. I shouldn't do that, right?

324
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:47,150
- We sweated. - We sweated on top of that.

325
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:49,035
Right. I should wash up.

326
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:54,205
(Should I give up too? I feel lazy. Should I just sleep?)

327
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:57,500
(This funniest-looking guy hasn't washed up either.)

328
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,405
What am I going to do?

329
00:15:01,737 --> 00:15:05,440
(Whenever they think about tomorrow, all of their zeal disappears.)

330
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:07,200
Who will end up wing walking?

331
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:08,340
(Who will it be?)

332
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:09,855
Gosh, I'm about to lose my mind.

333
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,710
(Getting up)

334
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,125
I really don't know.

335
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,655
- What are you doing? - I'm testing if I have energy left.

336
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,125
I still have energy.

337
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:22,935
(What are you doing in the middle of the night?)

338
00:15:23,392 --> 00:15:25,660
- Jae Seok. - So you're going to do it, right?

339
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:26,920
(You have energy left.)

340
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:28,235
No, I can't.

341
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,530
(You said you still had energy left.)

342
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,905
Would you do it?

343
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:34,170
I can't do it.

344
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,500
- I really can't do it. - If you get selected,

345
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,240
- you have to do it. - If I get selected?

346
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,870
Then I'd do it.

347
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,070
You will, right? That's fine.

348
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,440
If I get picked, I'll do it.

349
00:15:44,446 --> 00:15:47,510
I have to do it since it's a promise with the viewers.

350
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:48,925
(He keeps changing his mind.)

351
00:15:49,885 --> 00:15:51,520
(They're nervous about the penalty.)

352
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,125
Two members are exempted, right?

353
00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:54,690
(They calm down with facial masks.)

354
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,050
Isn't it three?

355
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,135
3 or 4 members have to ride it.

356
00:15:59,328 --> 00:16:00,820
(Let's just sleep.)

357
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,075
What do we do?

358
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,575
- Do your legs touch? - Aren't British people tall?

359
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,615
(This is strange.)

360
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:19,525
This bed is perfect for my height.

361
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:23,880
How is this possible?

362
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:27,935
(Try putting your legs on the pillow.)

363
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:32,935
By the way,

364
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,590
even if we do wing walk,

365
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:40,530
(If we do wing walk...)

366
00:16:40,536 --> 00:16:42,445
we still may go to the haunted castle.

367
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:47,170
We keep talking about the wing walk.

368
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,515
The haunted castle is the hardest.

369
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,140
(It's the final destination of Shuddering Package.)

370
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:55,050
(It's the haunted Oxford Castle.)

371
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,420
(It's a mysterious place where various journalists visited.)

372
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:04,565
(An exorcist even heard sounds of ghosts.)

373
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,590
(It's spooky.)

374
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:10,030
I have no idea what I did wrong.

375
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:11,660
(He's frustrated.)

376
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,945
I thought a lot about it.

377
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,745
This is wrong.

378
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:17,970
Let's turn off the lights.

379
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:19,545
(Let's sleep for now.)

380
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,270
It's impossible to know.

381
00:17:21,277 --> 00:17:23,855
You're right. Let's not think about it.

382
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,225
Let's sleep.

383
00:17:27,316 --> 00:17:29,125
(The lights turn off.)

384
00:17:29,985 --> 00:17:31,595
What's that red thing?

385
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,125
What's that sound?

386
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:36,265
Is there a red light in the bathroom?

387
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,590
I'm scared.

388
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:41,375
It's really scary. What's this?

389
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,730
Something touched me. Hey.

390
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,860
What is it?

391
00:17:45,868 --> 00:17:47,360
(They run away.)

392
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,975
- What's wrong? - There's something.

393
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,970
- Is it a light? - Yes.

394
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,340
How do I turn on the light?

395
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:55,210
(They're cowardly brothers.)

396
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,280
- Turn on the light. Hurry. - What's going on?

397
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,985
My cord startled me.

398
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:04,320
(Why would you be startled?)

399
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,850
My cord startled me.

400
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:07,620
- Which light is it? - What is it?

401
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:09,120
(What is this red light?)

402
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,550
It's the bathroom light.

403
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,090
(You mean the red light?)

404
00:18:12,094 --> 00:18:13,605
Can we turn it off?

405
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,135
Let's sleep with the light on.

406
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:20,760
(They spook themselves out while talking about ghosts.)

407
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:22,845
- Keep the light on. - Shall we keep the window open?

408
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:25,470
What do you think?

409
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:27,640
How about the door? Is that scarier?

410
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:29,610
(Shall we turn off the lights?)

411
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,340
- It's strange. - This is strange.

412
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,255
- It's strange. - What's going on?

413
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:37,380
This won't work.

414
00:18:37,386 --> 00:18:41,150
(He ponders about what to do.)

415
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,595
I have to go home.

416
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,520
Kwang Soo.

417
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:45,760
(Okay, Kwang Soo.)

418
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,035
Call a taxi.

419
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:49,475
Why do I feel nervous with the lights on?

420
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:51,360
I think it turns off.

421
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:52,675
(They couldn't sleep all night long.)

422
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,815
(The second day starts in a peaceful mountainous village, Zermatt.)

423
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:03,440
(What awaits those on the Luxury Package today?)

424
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:06,010
- Good morning. - Good morning.

425
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:09,425
- We're going to ride heli-skiing. - Yes.

426
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:10,955
Hello, heli-skiing.

427
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,250
I hope that the weather will be good for heli-skiing.

428
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,835
I hope that the weather will be beautiful...

429
00:19:17,926 --> 00:19:19,690
and that I won't have to pay.

430
00:19:19,695 --> 00:19:22,135
- Please. - It'll be very expensive.

431
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,960
Let's go heli-skiing.

432
00:19:23,966 --> 00:19:25,305
- Go, go. - Go, go.

433
00:19:25,968 --> 00:19:26,960
Goodness.

434
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:28,370
- Hello. - Hello.

435
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,515
- Good morning. - Hello.

436
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:32,800
Did you vote?

437
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:33,970
(There's a voting box for paragliding.)

438
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:35,970
- I didn't. - Did you vote?

439
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:38,340
- I didn't. - You seem like you just voted.

440
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:40,080
- Did you vote? - Pardon?

441
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:42,195
- Did you vote? - No, but we will vote now.

442
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:43,550
Let's do it.

443
00:19:43,552 --> 00:19:45,050
(There's no loyalty or teamwork.)

444
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,250
Shall we vote?

445
00:19:46,255 --> 00:19:48,165
Are we voting already?

446
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,760
(Whom will they vote to pay for the paragliding?)

447
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,465
It's a great morning.

448
00:19:56,165 --> 00:19:58,530
(Jong Kook starts to vote after Ji Hyo and Han Na.)

449
00:19:58,534 --> 00:20:00,075
What?

450
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:02,015
I'll vote for someone I know.

451
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:06,015
- Write it. - You can't do this.

452
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:08,340
(How can you tell me to vote in front of the camera?)

453
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,510
It's secret voting.

454
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,070
- You shouldn't look. - "Secret voting"?

455
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,110
There are no secrets.

456
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,385
- He doesn't have any secrets. - Excuse me.

457
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:16,625
He's a man without secrets.

458
00:20:17,052 --> 00:20:19,825
What's the point in keeping secrets? You're too quick to notice.

459
00:20:21,256 --> 00:20:23,535
Gosh, stop it.

460
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,435
Why are you following me?

461
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:27,160
- Leave. - Wait.

462
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:28,260
I understand.

463
00:20:28,263 --> 00:20:30,260
You're like the boy with a flute.

464
00:20:30,265 --> 00:20:31,660
- I want to keep following you. - Hey.

465
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,305
I got it.

466
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:36,070
- Are there any bodyguards? - No.

467
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,770
- Are there any guards? - No.

468
00:20:37,773 --> 00:20:40,600
Aren't there guards during votes?

469
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,140
- What are you doing? - It's a close-up.

470
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:43,510
- Hey... - Don't you know?

471
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:45,380
- Will you write one of our names? - No.

472
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,680
- It's a man. - Write it.

473
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:48,350
- Write down the name. - Goodness.

474
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,650
Haha.

475
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:51,110
(Jong Kook publicly votes for Haha.)

476
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,725
- Does this work? - Yes, thank you.

477
00:20:52,754 --> 00:20:54,320
Now,

478
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:56,465
- each of us will vote. - You're gangsters.

479
00:20:57,493 --> 00:20:59,005
We're gangsters.

480
00:20:59,094 --> 00:21:02,005
- You're real gangsters. - Voting is over.

481
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:03,575
- Let's go. - Please go.

482
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,530
(Members at the hotel prepare to ski.)

483
00:21:05,534 --> 00:21:07,275
We won't ever be back here.

484
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,630
Did you sleep well?

485
00:21:09,638 --> 00:21:10,830
Yes, I slept very well.

486
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,545
Did you make a video call?

487
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:14,470
(Reporter Haha is obsessive.)

488
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:15,855
Come on.

489
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:18,485
What's wrong with Haha? He's so nosy.

490
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:20,225
You look funny in a ski suit.

491
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,955
When I came out this morning,

492
00:21:23,852 --> 00:21:25,865
our staff thought that...

493
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,195
I was Ryang Hyun or Ryang Ha.

494
00:21:28,323 --> 00:21:31,220
(I didn't go to school.)

495
00:21:31,226 --> 00:21:32,960
- It looks fancy. - Don't I look like Turbo?

496
00:21:32,961 --> 00:21:34,535
You look like Turbo.

497
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:38,405
- It's white, it's snowing - It's snowing

498
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:41,930
- We're here. - We're here.

499
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:43,130
Everything is perfect.

500
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,370
(They head to summer ski in Switzerland.)

501
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:46,215
Let's go, summer skiing.

502
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,385
Let's get it.

503
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,380
- You talked a lot in your sleep. - What did I say?

504
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,580
"I'm scared, and I'm a coward."

505
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:56,250
(I'm scared, and I'm a coward.)

506
00:21:56,251 --> 00:22:00,680
I'm serious. It's true. You don't know, but I do.

507
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:02,590
- You kept talking in your sleep. - Yesterday, I found out...

508
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,735
- with whom you're having a fling. - Stop lying.

509
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:08,060
- Stop lying. - Shall I say the name?

510
00:22:08,063 --> 00:22:09,160
You'd better behave.

511
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,305
(They head to ski.)

512
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:12,800
(Ski rental shop and gondola lift)

513
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,045
Good morning.

514
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,500
Good morning.

515
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:17,545
Haha, Se Chan.

516
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,870
Ji Hyo.

517
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,785
You look pretty, Ji Hyo.

518
00:22:23,312 --> 00:22:25,780
Hello, you're here.

519
00:22:25,781 --> 00:22:27,625
- Who wants to rent skis? - Me.

520
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,210
One person?

521
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,410
Just one person.

522
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:31,665
Gosh.

523
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:33,495
I look the best today in Switzerland.

524
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:38,505
(He's excited.)

525
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:40,590
- Let's roll, baby. - Let's go.

526
00:22:40,596 --> 00:22:41,890
(I'll fly over the mountains with this ski board.)

527
00:22:41,897 --> 00:22:43,175
Go, go, go.

528
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,945
Go. Are we taking a helicopter?

529
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:47,860
Luxury, luxury.

530
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,545
(Alps, I'm coming.)

531
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:52,970
(Heli-ski: Jong Kook, Haha, Se Chan, Jin Young. Gondola: Ji Hyo, Han Na)

532
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:54,345
Here we go.

533
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:55,640
Here we go.

534
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:56,985
(Heli-ski: Jong Kook, Haha, Se Chan, Jin Young. Gondola: Ji Hyo, Han Na)

535
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,210
- It's fast. - It's really fast.

536
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:00,380
- It's going up. - Why is it so fast?

537
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:01,595
(Why is the gondola lift so fast?)

538
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,480
We get to enjoy the view of Switzerland.

539
00:23:04,486 --> 00:23:06,265
Right, we see it as much as we want.

540
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:08,320
- Hello. - Hello.

541
00:23:08,323 --> 00:23:09,690
(They ride a taxi to the heliport.)

542
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:11,320
Captain, you're wearing a tie.

543
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,790
(He's in charge of safety.)

544
00:23:12,794 --> 00:23:15,130
- What's your name? - Matias.

545
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,235
- "Matias"? - "Matias"?

546
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,560
- Matias. - What's your name?

547
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:20,960
Mr. Yang.

548
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,175
Yang Se Chan.

549
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:23,970
- Se Chan. - Yang Se Chan?

550
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,100
- Yes. - It's Yang.

551
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,470
- Mr. Yang. - Yang.

552
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:27,715
What's your name?

553
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,285
- Ha, Haha. - Ha?

554
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:32,955
Really.

555
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:35,510
- Double H. - "Double H".

556
00:23:35,517 --> 00:23:36,855
- Ha. - Yes.

557
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,165
How are you?

558
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,495
Are you ready for a helicopter flight?

559
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,850
- It's my first time. - Will helicopter...

560
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:44,765
- Are you afraid? - I'm a novice.

561
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:47,090
- I'm nervous. - Me too.

562
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,430
(Did he mean "nervous"?)

563
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,735
Are you sportive?

564
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,730
- What? - "Sportive"?

565
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,400
- Sportsman. - What?

566
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:54,945
What sports?

567
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,970
- Aren't you a sportsman? - No.

568
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,415
I'm an owner of Korean barbecue restaurant.

569
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,440
- You're Korean... Barbecue... - Barbecue.

570
00:24:03,445 --> 00:24:04,715
I own a restaurant.

571
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,885
- I don't understand. - I'm the owner.

572
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:11,580
(He cuts and grills meat.)

573
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:13,895
(He uses body language for communication.)

574
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:17,120
(They arrive at the heliport.)

575
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:18,405
Is this the place?

576
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:21,190
I can't believe it.

577
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:22,475
Are we riding this?

578
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:24,560
- Is it the photo? - I'm excited.

579
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,800
You're supposed to ride the helicopter.

580
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:29,070
Then you jump off on a slope and ski down.

581
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:31,770
(Some people jump off directly from the helicopter.)

582
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:33,140
We're not as good,

583
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,910
so we'll ski down after getting off the helicopter.

584
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,340
(They'll ski after getting off.)

585
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,840
I've never ridden a helicopter before.

586
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,185
(They'll ski after getting off.)

587
00:24:39,414 --> 00:24:41,080
There's a helicopter.

588
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,995
That's what we'll ride.

589
00:24:43,051 --> 00:24:45,520
- The helicopter is HH. - That's what we see...

590
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,335
- in movies. - It's HH.

591
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,435
- You see it in movies. - Right.

592
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,460
Okay, we're leaving. See you, Jong Kook.

593
00:24:53,462 --> 00:24:54,560
- See you. - Good luck.

594
00:24:54,563 --> 00:24:56,035
- See you soon. - Good luck.

595
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,590
- Good luck. - Let's go.

596
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,600
We'll stay alive.

597
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,745
(They get on the helicopter to ski.)

598
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,245
I'm scared.

599
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:04,800
It's my first time on a helicopter.

600
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:06,115
(Don't be afraid.)

601
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:11,485
(They get ready to take off.)

602
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:15,580
- I'm nervous. - Me too.

603
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:16,680
(They're very excited.)

604
00:25:16,685 --> 00:25:18,380
(The propeller starts to turn.)

605
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,925
I'm so nervous.

606
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:21,595
Did I make a wrong decision?

607
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,290
(They may never get this opportunity again.)

608
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,350
My goodness.

609
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,865
(They may never get this opportunity again.)

610
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:31,535
(They're about to take off.)

611
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:35,575
(Haha and Se Chan look extremely nervous.)

612
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,870
- I'm scared. - Are you ready?

613
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:39,040
- We're ready. - We're ready.

614
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,145
You're ready?

615
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:46,425
(The helicopter takes off.)

616
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,380
(As soon as it takes off,)

617
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:55,565
(it turns around.)

618
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:59,105
(What's happening?)

619
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:03,430
Gosh.

620
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,635
(Strong first impression)

621
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:12,645
- This is scary. - It is.

622
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:18,185
(The two cowards hold hands.)

623
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:20,755
My hands are shaking.

624
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:24,795
(See you in a bit.)

625
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,050
There's a helicopter. It must be ours.

626
00:26:29,057 --> 00:26:30,295
Let's see if it's ours.

627
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,805
It is ours.

628
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,430
It reminds me of the Nevis Swing.

629
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:40,005
At that time, we jumped from this high.

630
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:45,915
The Matterhorn is hiding again.

631
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:47,440
What's that?

632
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,855
(There are dark clouds all over the mountains.)

633
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:52,340
I'm jealous of them.

634
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:53,440
(It's a luxury to enjoy skiing in the summer.)

635
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:55,610
- I'm jealous. - Right?

636
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:58,920
The sand... Wait. Is this rain?

637
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,165
(Is this rain?)

638
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:03,050
It's raining. Let's get inside.

639
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:04,565
(It suddenly starts to rain heavily.)

640
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,560
(The helicopter is met with rain too.)

641
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:07,560
What's going on?

642
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:08,735
(The helicopter is met with rain too.)

643
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,105
(Shaking)

644
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:19,815
(The strong wind makes the helicopter shake.)

645
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:22,115
Can we really ski here?

646
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:28,895
(What is going on now?)

647
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:34,895
(The weather gets worse and worse.)

648
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,535
(The wind is getting stronger.)

649
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:44,575
(The ski slopes are closed.)

650
00:27:45,433 --> 00:27:47,330
(The staff members hold an emergency meeting.)

651
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,570
It might be dangerous when it rains.

652
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:50,570
Okay.

653
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:53,185
Wouldn't it be dangerous for the ski team?

654
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,870
What will happen to the ski team?

655
00:27:55,877 --> 00:27:58,655
(What will happen to Haha and Se Chan?)

656
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:01,510
(Scared)

657
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:02,655
(Screaming)

658
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:05,995
(The cowards are scared.)

659
00:28:06,588 --> 00:28:09,565
(The helicopter hurriedly gets ready to land.)

660
00:28:09,624 --> 00:28:11,595
(His eyes are shaking.)

661
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:14,605
(Can we even land?)

662
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,860
- I want to get off. - Let's get off.

663
00:28:17,866 --> 00:28:21,330
(The veteran pilot carefully prepares to land.)

664
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:23,975
(Nervous)

665
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:27,215
- We've landed. - We have?

666
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:30,115
- Okay. - Okay.

667
00:28:30,478 --> 00:28:32,585
Let's go!

668
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:36,525
I'm sweaty.

669
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:40,650
(The helicopter is unloaded.)

670
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:42,795
(Staggering)

671
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:50,805
(The helicopter goes back to pick up Jong Kook and Jin Young.)

672
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:54,475
Haha, it's so cold here.

673
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,400
(They're met with an extreme situation.)

674
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,785
- It's cold here. - It is.

675
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,240
- How are you? - We're fine.

676
00:29:01,242 --> 00:29:02,770
- We're good. - We're good.

677
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:04,240
I'm okay.

678
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,555
- It's raining. - Yes.

679
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,425
- Do we have to go back? - It's okay.

680
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,195
Is it okay?

681
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,580
(We've been looking forward to this.)

682
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,750
Gosh, why did it have to rain?

683
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:19,705
(We've been looking forward to this.)

684
00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:22,675
The wind is so strong.

685
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,345
(The local staff tries to find a solution.)

686
00:29:31,606 --> 00:29:34,715
It's pouring down.

687
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:40,340
(The helicopter is back to pick up Jong Kook and Jin Young.)

688
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:43,695
(Jong Kook and Jin Young leave for the mountain top.)

689
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:49,495
What should I do? I'm scared.

690
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:51,195
I'm scared.

691
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:54,120
(The helicopter takes off.)

692
00:29:54,129 --> 00:29:55,805
There's nothing to hold onto.

693
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,460
(Screaming)

694
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:00,605
Gosh.

695
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:04,115
(As soon as they take off, Jin Young starts to scream.)

696
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:07,015
What should I do? It's driving me crazy.

697
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:10,410
(Will my ears be fine?)

698
00:30:10,412 --> 00:30:15,050
This is so scary. What should I do?

699
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,295
What should I do? Jong Kook, please.

700
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:22,050
- There's a thunderstorm... - What should we do?

701
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,390
Stop talking and focus on flying the helicopter.

702
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:27,420
(That's bad manners.)

703
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:29,560
What should we do?

704
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:31,535
(Don't worry.)

705
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:34,360
(The helicopter turns around.)

706
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:36,475
What's happening?

707
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:40,340
We're turning back.

708
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:44,915
(Is the helicopter going back?)

709
00:30:46,414 --> 00:30:47,755
There must be something wrong.

710
00:30:48,383 --> 00:30:49,880
(Is there something wrong?)

711
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:55,150
There is a thunderstorm and lightning...

712
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:58,020
- There's lightning. - Lightning?

713
00:30:58,026 --> 00:31:01,405
- We can't go there? - No. That's too dangerous.

714
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:02,830
I don't want to die.

715
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:03,860
(What about Haha and Se Chan?)

716
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,860
- He says he doesn't want to die. - Right.

717
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:08,615
(What about Haha and Se Chan?)

718
00:31:09,437 --> 00:31:10,870
The weather is so bad.

719
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:12,185
(They get ready nevertheless.)

720
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,085
No?

721
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:19,340
It's canceled?

722
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:22,380
(The skiing is canceled due to the thunderstorm and lightning.)

723
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,380
- It's dangerous? - It's dangerous.

724
00:31:24,385 --> 00:31:25,765
It's dangerous.

725
00:31:27,856 --> 00:31:29,235
Gosh.

726
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,465
Of course. This is who we are.

727
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:36,960
What a disappointment. What is this?

728
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:38,460
We're finally in Switzerland.

729
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:40,075
(We've been looking forward.)

730
00:31:40,335 --> 00:31:42,415
It took us more than 20 hours to get here.

731
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:45,240
- This is not okay. - I'm so sorry.

732
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,815
No!

733
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,970
(This must be a dream!)

734
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:53,025
- No! - Let's go.

735
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:55,180
- Why? - Why?

736
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:56,955
No!

737
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,650
(It took them 28 hours to get here, but the skiing is canceled.)

738
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,065
No!

739
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,050
No!

740
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:05,560
(Repeating)

741
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,060
No!

742
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,135
Let us ski!

743
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:13,075
We're stranded in Antarctica right now.

744
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,205
- Help! - Help!

745
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:18,015
- Help! - Gosh, it hurts.

746
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,500
- It hurts. - It hurts.

747
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:24,615
(The sudden hail makes them realize the seriousness of the situation.)

748
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:27,125
Can a helicopter take off?

749
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:30,180
(What if no helicopter can come?)

750
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:31,825
Will we be abandoned?

751
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,650
This is pretty serious.

752
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,695
(Emergency)

753
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,290
(They're trapped on the Alps.)

754
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,420
(What will happen to them?)

755
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:40,565
This is horrible.

756
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,290
If they can't ski,

757
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:46,230
they have to wait for a helicopter?

758
00:32:46,234 --> 00:32:48,445
- Yes. - Is it that bad?

759
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:50,670
(Thunder)

760
00:32:50,672 --> 00:32:52,345
Are they okay?

761
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:53,985
Is the helicopter team okay?

762
00:32:54,442 --> 00:32:58,170
(Jong Kook and Jin Young who returned immediately are safe,)

763
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,955
(but Haha and Se Chan are trapped.)

764
00:33:03,284 --> 00:33:04,380
(They can't come back without a helicopter.)

765
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,565
This is serious.

766
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,750
How will they come back then?

767
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,590
(There's nothing they can do.)

768
00:33:10,592 --> 00:33:13,420
- They're stranded. - Yes. I'm worried.

769
00:33:13,428 --> 00:33:16,375
(Will they be okay?)

770
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:20,160
Okay.

771
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:22,445
(Thunder)

772
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,940
(Is this real?)

773
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,085
I'm scared.

774
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:29,955
Let's run away.

775
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,225
Help me.

776
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:39,895
(With the weather getting worse, the staff becomes busy.)

777
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:42,120
(What will happen to us?)

778
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,265
Help me.

779
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:47,560
The second helicopter came...

780
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:51,235
(Emergency meetings are held.)

781
00:33:51,666 --> 00:33:53,430
(The experts gather everyone together.)

782
00:33:53,434 --> 00:33:55,400
- Here. - Haha, come here.

783
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:56,830
(The experts gather everyone together.)

784
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:59,170
Come and sit down on the ground.

785
00:33:59,173 --> 00:34:01,400
(All they can do is...)

786
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:07,340
(wait for help.)

787
00:34:07,348 --> 00:34:10,395
Why does the weather have to be this bad?

788
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:15,180
(They wait and wait.)

789
00:34:15,189 --> 00:34:16,595
A helicopter is coming.

790
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,865
A helicopter is coming.

791
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:24,360
(A helicopter appears like a miracle.)

792
00:34:24,365 --> 00:34:30,715
(The veteran rescue team flies through the bad weather.)

793
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,670
This is better than being rescued.

794
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:34,570
(We're safe now.)

795
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:38,785
It feels like we're being rescued. Help me.

796
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,795
(A rescue helicopter arrives.)

797
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:48,695
(We're safe now, right?)

798
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:54,505
(They get on the helicopter under the experts' guidance.)

799
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:59,760
(They take off safely.)

800
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,060
We should laugh.

801
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,275
(They can't believe the situation.)

802
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:05,600
(Why do things never go our way?)

803
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,915
You're the best.

804
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:09,355
Thank you!

805
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:14,055
I'm so disappointed.

806
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,995
(They're forced to give up heli-skiing.)

807
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,265
Haha, look over there. We were just there.

808
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,660
- Where? - Over there. Behind that mountain.

809
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:29,135
- Behind that mountain? - Yes.

810
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:31,460
Jin Young, once we go over the mountain,

811
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:34,060
there's a new world.

812
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:36,145
- "A new world"? - Yes.

813
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:38,430
The slope isn't what you see now.

814
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,845
- We dodged thunder three times. - Really?

815
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:42,870
That's incredible.

816
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:43,940
(It's an incredible story.)

817
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,355
It's funny, isn't it?

818
00:35:46,347 --> 00:35:47,685
It's supposed to be luxurious.

819
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:49,180
- It's not. - It's not.

820
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,910
We spent the money anyway, right?

821
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,380
Someone has to pay.

822
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:55,065
(Someone still has to pay.)

823
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,820
Is the money considered spent?

824
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,720
- We rode the helicopter. - We did.

825
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:00,965
(It will be unfair for the one who pays.)

826
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,475
Today's weather is beautiful.

827
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:07,900
- Listen. - Why do I feel so frustrated?

828
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:09,430
The weather is too beautiful.

829
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:10,900
Look at the sky.

830
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:12,700
(The clouds look like cotton candy.)

831
00:36:12,707 --> 00:36:15,070
We're definitely in Europe.

832
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:16,385
There are horses.

833
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:18,925
- It's beautiful. - There are horses.

834
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,455
It's so amazing.

835
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:22,650
Everyone, did you sleep well?

836
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,850
- No. - No.

837
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,050
(Everyone feels the same.)

838
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:26,420
I woke up every two hours.

839
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:31,190
Soon, you'll do wing walking as your penalty.

840
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:34,705
I always ask, but what did we do wrong?

841
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:37,390
What did I do so wrong in my life?

842
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:38,630
- What is it? - I keep wondering.

843
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,000
- I keep wondering too. - We're in the UK.

844
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:45,115
Why are you wearing makeup when we're going to wing walk?

845
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,840
- Don't think that I wear makeup. - I can't believe it.

846
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:52,070
No one else is wearing makeup including me.

847
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,340
Where did you get your makeup done of all people?

848
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:56,080
Da Hee did it for me this morning.

849
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,450
- Da Hee? - She did my makeup.

850
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,450
- I did it for him. - Da Hee is good.

851
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:01,580
(He's very satisfied.)

852
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:03,720
- Da Hee is talented. - She did a good job.

853
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:04,720
(He loves it.)

854
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:05,720
(Let's see.)

855
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:07,760
Did you do yours, Seok Jin?

856
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:10,605
(Did you do yours, Seok Jin?)

857
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:14,060
- Does it look bad? - His makeup looks...

858
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,900
- so obvious. I know. - I put on some BB cream.

859
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,270
I can see that.

860
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:21,015
I'd like to share some information.

861
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:23,955
It's about Team Switzerland who's on the Luxury Package.

862
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,740
Due to inclement weather,

863
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:30,080
their schedule for today got canceled.

864
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,110
- Shouldn't the weather be good? - Wait.

865
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,450
- This is inclement weather too. - Isn't this inclement weather?

866
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:36,520
Switzerland is known for good weather.

867
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:38,290
That is true, and here,

868
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:42,120
- the weather tends to fluctuate. - It rains a lot.

869
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:45,960
Unluckily, Team Switzerland can't continue their schedule.

870
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:49,275
However, we're lucky.

871
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:51,900
- We'll follow the schedule. - Is that good?

872
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:53,640
- It's not good. - How are we lucky?

873
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:56,655
Is it true that we're lucky and that they aren't?

874
00:37:56,878 --> 00:38:00,780
Anyway, today's weather in the UK is considered ideal.

875
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,925
It's a very clear day.

876
00:38:03,317 --> 00:38:04,710
- It's interesting. - Why today?

877
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,050
- How is it possible? - Why today?

878
00:38:06,053 --> 00:38:09,250
It rains a lot here, so I brought a raincoat.

879
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:11,165
- Everyone wears a raincoat. - It's useless.

880
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:14,590
(This is the usual weather in the UK.)

881
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:16,160
(Aren't umbrellas expected here?)

882
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:19,200
It's such a sunny day. It's too sunny.

883
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,900
- The weather is best for traveling. - It's the best.

884
00:38:21,903 --> 00:38:25,000
Since we're here to be penalized, this is considered a disaster.

885
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:27,340
Are there any issues for the wing walking flight?

886
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:29,815
- The weather is ideal. - "Ideal"?

887
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,810
- The rest of the people... - Look.

888
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:34,010
- So Min, you never know. - Listen.

889
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:37,280
- Stand here, Da Hee. - The three of us should ride it.

890
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:40,320
Your outfits match each other.

891
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,390
(As they're standing, their outfits match.)

892
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,590
- Let's get it. - They're like a campus couple.

893
00:38:44,592 --> 00:38:46,920
- When So Min was eating breakfast, - That's right.

894
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:48,935
Sang Yeob came over.

895
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,960
She said, "A young master is coming."

896
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:53,230
- I called him a prince. - Why is he a prince?

897
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:56,330
He looks handsome like a prince.

898
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:58,700
I called So Min to have breakfast together.

899
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,340
I said that everyone was coming.

900
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:02,610
She said, "I want to sleep more."

901
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,670
"What about Sang Yeob?" "He's coming."

902
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,010
"I'll be there."

903
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:06,780
(So Min decided to join.)

904
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:07,810
That's what she said.

905
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:09,350
- Gosh. - Goodness.

906
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,550
- She plays favorites. - Seriously.

907
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,820
- What's wrong with you? - I thought you were tired of him.

908
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,520
- He looks British. - Is that so?

909
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,050
(He has strong features.)

910
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:20,820
- He looks British with thick lines. - After watching him,

911
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,830
- I know why Sang Yeob stands out. - Why?

912
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,830
- When I look at him, - Look.

913
00:39:24,832 --> 00:39:26,930
- Look. - Sang Yeob is...

914
00:39:26,934 --> 00:39:30,270
- Join us and make him look better. - He's very handsome.

915
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:31,600
- Kwang Soo. - Come here.

916
00:39:31,606 --> 00:39:33,600
- Come here, Kwang Soo. - I'm not Ki Beom.

917
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:35,500
- I'm not Ki Beom. - Stop it.

918
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,170
- Look. - He's very handsome.

919
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:40,180
Da Hee takes care of Kwang Soo.

920
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,795
So Min takes care of Sang Yeob.

921
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:44,050
Who takes care of me?

922
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:47,050
I'm okay, but no one takes care of Seok Jin.

923
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,665
Please care about me.

924
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:51,150
- That's hilarious. - Do you know if I have eaten?

925
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:54,090
Chun Yoo, Kwon Ryeol. Take care of Seok Jin.

926
00:39:54,095 --> 00:39:56,490
No one cares even if he's lying on the restroom floor.

927
00:39:56,497 --> 00:40:00,045
Don't help Kwang Soo with makeup. Help Seok Jin.

928
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:02,500
He applied his own makeup.

929
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,500
He wipes off his face with yellow tissue.

930
00:40:04,505 --> 00:40:06,070
(He takes care of himself.)

931
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,970
He says, "Okay."

932
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:10,010
- I don't know what he uses. - It's yellow.

933
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:12,285
It's not for pooping, right? What's that?

934
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:14,210
Can you buy yellow tissue?

935
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:15,440
- Is there yellow tissue? - No.

936
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,655
It becomes yellow after I wipe my face, you fool.

937
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:22,535
Take care of me. I barely make it each day.

938
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,565
I walk because my eyes open in the morning.

939
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,160
- It's because my eyes open. - He barely lives.

940
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,460
- Please take care of him. - Goodness.

941
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,560
I take care of him from time to time,

942
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:34,900
but no one else cares about him.

943
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,875
Check if I'm breathing at night.

944
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,100
Why?

945
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,645
It's getting sadder.

946
00:40:39,874 --> 00:40:44,015
We'll head to the city of Oxford.

947
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:45,310
Shall we go?

948
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,180
- I don't feel good. - Are we going directly?

949
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:49,480
- It's better to feel good. - It'll be tiring.

950
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:52,210
I feel better because I'm less likely to be penalized.

951
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,280
Da Hee takes good care of people.

952
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:57,350
- Jae Seok takes care of you. - That's right.

953
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,420
I'm the only one who cares about him.

954
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:02,435
- No one else does. - He helps Seok Jin a lot.

955
00:41:02,496 --> 00:41:03,960
- Is he his assistant? - Yes.

956
00:41:03,964 --> 00:41:06,075
- "I'll sacrifice myself." - "I'll sacrifice myself."

957
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:08,700
This is the wrong side.

958
00:41:08,703 --> 00:41:11,000
- "I'll sacrifice myself." - This is the wrong side.

959
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,470
That was wrong.

960
00:41:12,473 --> 00:41:14,600
- It's the driver's seat. - Why did you open that door?

961
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:16,370
- The driver is sitting there. - It's on the right.

962
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:19,140
- I'm sorry. - You startled him.

963
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:20,780
The steering wheel is on the other side.

964
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:23,080
- Why did you open that door? - I'm sorry.

965
00:41:23,084 --> 00:41:25,650
- Hello. - He makes a mistake immediately.

966
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,180
(I'm sorry.)

967
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:30,020
I forgot that the steering wheel was on the right.

968
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,665
- Goodness. - Gosh.

969
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,105
The flower is still alive.

970
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:37,835
I've never seen the UK with such great weather.

971
00:41:37,898 --> 00:41:39,860
- Look at the trees. - Everything is beautiful here.

972
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:42,505
- This looks amazing. - Even the shape...

973
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:44,170
of the trees is different.

974
00:41:44,171 --> 00:41:45,940
Aren't they tall and grand?

975
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,470
- They're pretty. - This is the campus.

976
00:41:47,475 --> 00:41:50,040
- Really? - Oxford University?

977
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:51,310
- Is this it? - Really?

978
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:53,180
I should take photos of Oxford.

979
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,355
(It looks sophisticated for a reason.)

980
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,150
(I should take photos.)

981
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:59,320
Are you applying to the school?

982
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,925
No, I'm not.

983
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:04,050
Please drive slowly.

984
00:42:04,058 --> 00:42:06,105
- He can't take photos. - Ivy on the wall.

985
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,460
- "Ivy on the wall"? - Wait a minute.

986
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:09,605
Seok Jin.

987
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,530
Let me take photos.

988
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,660
I want my child to dream of coming here.

989
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,400
Driver, please slow down.

990
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,570
(He begs the driver to slow down.)

991
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:19,245
- Slow. - Seok Jin.

992
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,185
I couldn't take any. Hey.

993
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:22,840
Poor Seok Jin.

994
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:24,570
All I took was this.

995
00:42:24,578 --> 00:42:25,640
(He's terrible at taking quick photos.)

996
00:42:25,646 --> 00:42:28,155
- I feel bad for him. - What are all these?

997
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,625
That's funny.

998
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:35,250
I thought about applying to Oxford.

999
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,920
(He talks nonsense.)

1000
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:38,990
- Pardon? - Come on.

1001
00:42:38,993 --> 00:42:40,360
I'm free to apply, aren't I?

1002
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,990
- I know, but why? - Goodness.

1003
00:42:42,997 --> 00:42:44,505
It's a waste of application fee.

1004
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,605
That's too harsh.

1005
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:50,570
You're being too harsh.

1006
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:53,100
I'll summarize what's going on.

1007
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,900
Before leaving Incheon Airport,

1008
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:57,370
1st and 2nd places get Pirate Roulette Game with 24 slots.

1009
00:42:57,378 --> 00:42:59,070
3rd and 4th places get 16 slots.

1010
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,910
5th and 6th places get 8 slots.

1011
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,085
(The size of Pirate Roulette Game differs by penalty badges.)

1012
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:04,050
1st and 2nd places get 24 slots.

1013
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:05,580
3rd and 4th places get 16 slots.

1014
00:43:05,586 --> 00:43:08,320
5th and 6th places get 8 slots.

1015
00:43:08,322 --> 00:43:11,350
You'll play in the order of last to first.

1016
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:12,860
(They'll play in the order of last to first.)

1017
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:16,405
The 1st 3 to lose will wing walk.

1018
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:20,460
Da Hee and Kwang Soo are 5th and 6th.

1019
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:21,460
That's right.

1020
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:24,100
They get Pirate Roulette Game with eight slots.

1021
00:43:24,104 --> 00:43:25,700
Sang Yeob is in first place.

1022
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,100
- He gets 24 slots. - That's amazing.

1023
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,240
- 2nd and 3rd have tied scores. - Their scores are tied.

1024
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,185
They're So Min and Seok Jin.

1025
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:38,110
Jae Seok placed 4th. He gets 16 slots.

1026
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:42,350
So Min and Seok Jin remain. Are we heading to wing walking?

1027
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,320
- We have no time to lose. - We're on our way.

1028
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,720
- Let's hurry and play. - Let's decide.

1029
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,290
Can't you yield?

1030
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,130
- We should compete. - Don't you know how to yield?

1031
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:53,360
- So Min and I talked last night. - About what?

1032
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:56,075
- This is what So Min told me. - What?

1033
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:57,970
(Before going to bed last night)

1034
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,570
I'll work hard if I don't get penalized this time.

1035
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:04,555
Have you accepted penalty for someone?

1036
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,485
On this show?

1037
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:08,355
You haven't once, right?

1038
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,780
Have you, So Min?

1039
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:13,720
- No. - Have you done it for guests...

1040
00:44:13,721 --> 00:44:15,320
- or other members? - Come on.

1041
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,320
- I'm serious. - Da Hee.

1042
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:20,720
- Gosh. - You're scared of it, aren't you?

1043
00:44:20,728 --> 00:44:22,875
- I've never done it. - You haven't, right?

1044
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:25,690
As a member,

1045
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,460
you should do it.

1046
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:30,930
- Da Hee. - Do a difficult task for someone.

1047
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:33,685
- Have you sacrificed yourself? - No.

1048
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,945
That would be amazing.

1049
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:38,385
Do you want to try it?

1050
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,325
You should try it.

1051
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:44,880
She's never sacrificed herself, so she wants to try it this time.

1052
00:44:44,885 --> 00:44:46,180
I never said that.

1053
00:44:46,186 --> 00:44:48,180
(She's determined.)

1054
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:49,290
Never.

1055
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:50,535
(Is that so?)

1056
00:44:51,058 --> 00:44:53,160
Let's go to the site first...

1057
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,720
- Shall we do it there? - and decide.

1058
00:44:55,729 --> 00:44:59,230
I heard that weather in the UK is terrible, but it's beautiful.

1059
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:02,160
I heard all my life that the weather in the UK is bad.

1060
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:05,700
- All your life? - My friends told me about it.

1061
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:07,115
Who?

1062
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:10,210
His name is Go Pil Seob. Do you know him?

1063
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,240
(His name is Go Pil Seob. Do you know him?)

1064
00:45:13,247 --> 00:45:15,580
He works at an investment company.

1065
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:17,710
- Why are you getting upset? - Do you know my friend?

1066
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:20,520
- I was just asking. - Do you know Pil Seob?

1067
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:22,195
- You don't know him. - Goodness.

1068
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:25,765
Everyone is so sensitive. It's scary.

1069
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,020
(This bus full of sensitive people...)

1070
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:32,375
(drives for a while.)

1071
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,030
- It's an open field. - It's so refreshing.

1072
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:36,500
I didn't know the UK could look like this.

1073
00:45:36,503 --> 00:45:38,145
Oh, my.

1074
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:40,545
Look at that.

1075
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:42,240
What's that?

1076
00:45:42,242 --> 00:45:43,910
- What's that? - It's so pretty.

1077
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,085
(There is no end to the blue sky and the green field.)

1078
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:46,385
It's beautiful.

1079
00:45:47,648 --> 00:45:50,910
(When things get tough,)

1080
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:55,050
(we sing.)

1081
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:59,635
(They try to forget the reality.)

1082
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:03,235
We must be here.

1083
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:05,275
- Really? - Are we here?

1084
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,260
- We are. - We are?

1085
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,130
We're making a turn.

1086
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:10,330
Are we really here?

1087
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:11,730
We're here.

1088
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:12,885
We're in trouble.

1089
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,715
This is reality.

1090
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:16,870
If we fall, it'll be easy to find us.

1091
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,470
(If we fall, it'll be easy to find us.)

1092
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:19,685
So Min.

1093
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,640
If we fall, it'll be easy to find us.

1094
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:22,825
So Min.

1095
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,810
(Why do you have to say that?)

1096
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:27,420
- I see a plane. - Really?

1097
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:28,880
Look at that.

1098
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:31,535
- It's a plane. - Look at that chair.

1099
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:34,460
(Coughing)

1100
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:35,835
I'm going to throw up.

1101
00:46:36,397 --> 00:46:39,130
- Are we going to sit on that chair? - That's crazy.

1102
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,660
(Just by seeing the plane, they become extremely nervous.)

1103
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,915
- This is crazy. - What should we do?

1104
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,870
(There is a small chair on the plane.)

1105
00:46:45,873 --> 00:46:47,500
- This is crazy. - What should we do?

1106
00:46:47,508 --> 00:46:49,915
- We're going to sit on a chair? - There's a chair on the plane.

1107
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:51,270
That's a chair?

1108
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:52,540
(There is a lonely chair on the plane.)

1109
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:54,955
There's nothing else.

1110
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:57,580
(With a maximum speed of 217km per h,)

1111
00:46:57,584 --> 00:47:00,450
(the plane can fly as high as 457m.)

1112
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:03,020
(Wing walking is one of the world's most extreme sports.)

1113
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:06,090
(Their amazing experience begins soon.)

1114
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:07,720
- That... - Doesn't it look a bit unstable?

1115
00:47:07,728 --> 00:47:10,430
So that's how it looks.

1116
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:12,090
Don't you think the chair will fall off?

1117
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:14,530
- It looks like... - Yes, it looks like that.

1118
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:15,600
I mean...

1119
00:47:15,602 --> 00:47:16,700
(They become even more worried.)

1120
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:18,670
I can't believe it. I can't do this.

1121
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:21,000
I can't do this. What should I do?

1122
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:22,870
I really can't do this.

1123
00:47:22,876 --> 00:47:25,770
Seriously. What should I do?

1124
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:27,080
So Min.

1125
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:29,080
Seriously.

1126
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,580
So Min is doing it again.

1127
00:47:31,585 --> 00:47:32,755
She's doing it again.

1128
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:34,450
(Tearful)

1129
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:35,850
I'm so scared.

1130
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:37,120
(To avoid wing walking, they have to survive the game.)

1131
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,320
It'll feel so lonely up there.

1132
00:47:39,326 --> 00:47:41,320
I have a question.

1133
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:42,790
How long will it go on?

1134
00:47:42,796 --> 00:47:44,290
10 minutes.

1135
00:47:44,298 --> 00:47:46,130
- 10 minutes? - That's too long.

1136
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,300
- 10 minutes... - That's too long.

1137
00:47:47,301 --> 00:47:48,945
Are there seat belts?

1138
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,475
I hope the chair is not soldered.

1139
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:52,715
Soldered?

1140
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,570
What are you talking about?

1141
00:47:54,575 --> 00:47:56,710
- I hope it's secure. - I thought I couldn't laugh,

1142
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,055
- but that's just absurd. - Soldered?

1143
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:00,855
It's possible.

1144
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,410
I hope it's fixed securely.

1145
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:03,595
But...

1146
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,720
The weather is perfect for flying.

1147
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,520
The weather looks nice.

1148
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:11,265
(Which 3 of them will experience wing walking?)

1149
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:13,165
Gosh, I'm so disappointed.

1150
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:14,965
It's here.

1151
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:16,960
- Go on. - Go on.

1152
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,375
- Go on, Jin Young. - Go on.

1153
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,045
Hello. Come.

1154
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:24,315
All we've done today is wait.

1155
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,400
Don't film. We're alone together.

1156
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,685
(Don't film. We're alone together.)

1157
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:29,000
(Matt is still full of energy.)

1158
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:31,355
- He's so cheerful. - Are you married?

1159
00:48:31,612 --> 00:48:32,710
Are you married?

1160
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:33,710
(No ring)

1161
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:34,925
No?

1162
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,480
I'm so relieved to have him here.

1163
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:38,855
(Cheerful)

1164
00:48:39,186 --> 00:48:41,525
She says she's relieved because of you.

1165
00:48:41,655 --> 00:48:43,320
(Surprised)

1166
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,850
(Out of nowhere, she sings.)

1167
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,460
(Laughing)

1168
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:49,775
What are you doing?

1169
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,505
- We? - Yes.

1170
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,660
Are you a CEO?

1171
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,600
(Are you a CEO like Haha?)

1172
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:57,675
Take a guess.

1173
00:48:58,138 --> 00:48:59,170
- Take a guess. - Guess what she does.

1174
00:48:59,173 --> 00:49:00,385
She's a singer.

1175
00:49:01,642 --> 00:49:03,370
- Sing for him. - You're a singer.

1176
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:05,370
It's raining men

1177
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:07,040
(It's raining men)

1178
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,440
(Matt looks surprised.)

1179
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,625
(Matt is having more fun.)

1180
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:15,125
(Two cheerful people meet.)

1181
00:49:16,256 --> 00:49:19,805
(Jin Young's first concert in Switzerland)

1182
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:23,660
(Matt can't take his eyes off of Jin Young.)

1183
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:28,045
(Goodbye, rain)

1184
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:29,330
Remix.

1185
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:30,475
(What do you think?)

1186
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,530
- You're amazing. - Thank you.

1187
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,270
- Everything about you is amazing. - Thank you so much.

1188
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,270
You too.

1189
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:38,015
(Matt's heart melts.)

1190
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:39,540
Sorry.

1191
00:49:39,546 --> 00:49:41,185
Why would you say sorry?

1192
00:49:41,215 --> 00:49:43,325
- Why? - Nothing.

1193
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,450
- So? - He's a singer too.

1194
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,265
- You're a singer too? - Yes.

1195
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:49,550
(Matt is on guard.)

1196
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:51,795
All right. 1, 2, 3...

1197
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:55,090
(Jong Kook is suddenly asked to sing.)

1198
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:58,790
(The situation is not the best, but Jong Kook sings his best.)

1199
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:00,060
Your voice is better.

1200
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:02,030
(Suddenly)

1201
00:50:02,035 --> 00:50:03,730
(Matt can't get over Jin Young's singing.)

1202
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:04,870
- Thank you. - Sorry.

1203
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:05,970
It's all right.

1204
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:08,445
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1205
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,685
- My feet are so comfortable. - Right?

1206
00:50:12,312 --> 00:50:14,040
- How are you? - I'm fine.

1207
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:15,740
(Matt sits next to Jin Young.)

1208
00:50:15,749 --> 00:50:17,155
He seems to be into you.

1209
00:50:17,551 --> 00:50:19,250
(Shy)

1210
00:50:19,253 --> 00:50:20,625
Sing "Listen" for him.

1211
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:27,035
(She does everything she is asked to do.)

1212
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:30,305
(She puts emotions into the song.)

1213
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,390
What is she doing?

1214
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,400
(What is she doing?)

1215
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,415
(Haha is embarrassed.)

1216
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,600
Is this a musical?

1217
00:50:37,604 --> 00:50:39,130
(Matt is applauding.)

1218
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,585
(Embarrassed.)

1219
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,785
- I don't speak Korean yet. - Not at all?

1220
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,885
- I can say no words. - No words?

1221
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,640
"I love you."

1222
00:50:47,648 --> 00:50:48,840
(Jong Kook's Korean class)

1223
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,080
- "I". - "I".

1224
00:50:50,083 --> 00:50:52,350
- "Love". - "Love".

1225
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:53,650
- "You". - "You".

1226
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:54,925
"I love you."

1227
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,420
- "I love you." - Yes.

1228
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:58,365
- "I love you." - "I love you."

1229
00:50:58,558 --> 00:50:59,965
Say that to her.

1230
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,805
- What does it mean? - It means,

1231
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:03,305
- "I love you." - "I love you."

1232
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:05,405
(Really?)

1233
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:07,930
(Is that what it means?)

1234
00:51:07,934 --> 00:51:09,130
His eyebrows...

1235
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:11,915
That was a genuine reaction.

1236
00:51:12,572 --> 00:51:14,585
I know the only thing I'll have to know.

1237
00:51:14,608 --> 00:51:15,785
Yes.

1238
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,285
You're a Casanova.

1239
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:20,085
- Me? - Casanova.

1240
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:22,125
No.

1241
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:24,325
- You're a Casanova. - I'm...

1242
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,280
I'm shy.

1243
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,595
"I'm shy"?

1244
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:29,890
(He knows how to win a girl's heart.)

1245
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,450
The train should leave.

1246
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:33,490
It should leave right now.

1247
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:34,990
- Look at him. - Look at him.

1248
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:36,705
Touch his hand and face.

1249
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,130
(Bye, my love, Matt.)

1250
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:41,775
(I love you. I'll never forget you.)

1251
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,230
He is so funny.

1252
00:51:43,236 --> 00:51:44,570
(They say goodbye through the window.)

1253
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:46,715
Han Na, try putting your hand on the window.

1254
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:48,470
(To test Matt, Han Na gives it a try.)

1255
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,385
- Let's see. - He might react.

1256
00:51:50,644 --> 00:51:51,670
He won't.

1257
00:51:51,678 --> 00:51:54,180
(Will Matt react to Han Na too?)

1258
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:56,525
(He points at Jin Young.)

1259
00:51:57,317 --> 00:51:59,650
(He looks determined.)

1260
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:02,850
(Who are you?)

1261
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:04,520
He rejected her.

1262
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:05,865
He rejected Han Na.

1263
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:07,460
Good.

1264
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,820
(Good job, Matt.)

1265
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,360
- He's so funny. - Han Na got rejected.

1266
00:52:10,364 --> 00:52:11,430
He's hilarious.

1267
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,330
(Jin Young is satisfied, and Han Na is disappointed.)

1268
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,830
She got rejected.

1269
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:17,575
(Thank you for the good memories, Matt!)

1270
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:18,970
(Ji Hyo and Han Na are finally back.)

1271
00:52:18,972 --> 00:52:20,285
Are you guys alive?

1272
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,170
- Jin Young - Are you alive?

1273
00:52:22,175 --> 00:52:24,470
- Guys. - What happened?

1274
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,080
- We almost died. - It's...

1275
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,285
Is this really the Luxury Package?

1276
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:32,625
- Let's calculate. - This is a debt tour.

1277
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:33,980
It's a debt tour.

1278
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:36,890
You should pay for paragliding, right?

1279
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,250
Because of what happened,

1280
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:43,675
- we'll check in early. - Let's go.

1281
00:52:45,465 --> 00:52:47,475
Gosh. If it weren't for the rain...

1282
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:50,100
- The view would have been amazing. - It would have been fantastic.

1283
00:52:50,103 --> 00:52:51,430
(The hotel is on a mountainside.)

1284
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:52,745
Gosh.

1285
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,915
This building has...

1286
00:52:55,142 --> 00:52:57,610
very low ceilings.

1287
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:58,640
It's very unique.

1288
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:00,140
(They're guided to a place.)

1289
00:53:00,147 --> 00:53:01,825
We climbed a hill...

1290
00:53:01,982 --> 00:53:03,550
- What's that? - What's that?

1291
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:04,925
(Surprised)

1292
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:08,850
(What is this place?)

1293
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:10,590
- Hi. - It looks amazing.

1294
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:12,020
(They say hi to the mysterious man.)

1295
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:13,405
Is this...

1296
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,575
- What is this? - Will someone cook for us?

1297
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:18,575
Does this living room only belong to us?

1298
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:20,205
Really?

1299
00:53:20,567 --> 00:53:21,860
The whole place belongs to us?

1300
00:53:21,868 --> 00:53:23,915
- It seems so. - It does?

1301
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,775
The whole place is yours.

1302
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:27,670
(The whole place is yours.)

1303
00:53:27,674 --> 00:53:30,640
There are four more floors.

1304
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:32,140
Take a look around.

1305
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:33,440
- Amazing. - I got goosebumps.

1306
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:34,625
(I got goosebumps.)

1307
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,980
(The hotel is located in Zermatt's best spot.)

1308
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,080
I love this.

1309
00:53:39,085 --> 00:53:40,550
- Look. - My goodness.

1310
00:53:40,554 --> 00:53:42,580
(It's an exclusive hotel that is rented as a whole.)

1311
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:44,850
This is so luxurious.

1312
00:53:44,858 --> 00:53:47,635
This is what we've been waiting for.

1313
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,520
It's amazing.

1314
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,530
(When you go downstairs,)

1315
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:52,660
(more luxury unfolds.)

1316
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,175
- The rooms look amazing too. - Each room has a different theme.

1317
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:58,700
This place is so luxurious.

1318
00:53:58,705 --> 00:54:00,015
It's fantastic.

1319
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,570
Let's look around.

1320
00:54:01,575 --> 00:54:03,310
This is so luxurious.

1321
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,540
- This room looks amazing. - It looks fantastic.

1322
00:54:05,545 --> 00:54:07,285
It looks so great.

1323
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:10,395
- I love the atmosphere. - Seriously.

1324
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:12,780
- Is there more? - What's that?

1325
00:54:12,786 --> 00:54:14,480
(This floor looks a bit different.)

1326
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,295
- There's a gym. - There's a gym.

1327
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,020
There's a sauna too.

1328
00:54:18,024 --> 00:54:19,695
- There's a pool. - A sauna.

1329
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:21,920
This is amazing.

1330
00:54:21,928 --> 00:54:23,290
(Enjoy the pool and the spa while looking over Zermatt.)

1331
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:25,130
What is this place?

1332
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:27,675
Guys. Seriously?

1333
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:30,415
This place is so luxurious.

1334
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:32,830
- I love this. - It's incredible.

1335
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:34,800
(He is the butler.)

1336
00:54:34,808 --> 00:54:35,840
This is amazing.

1337
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:37,640
Can we drink the stuff in the fridge?

1338
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:39,340
- It's included. - Right?

1339
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:42,025
This is why it's called Luxury Package.

1340
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,355
Everyone, thank you for today.

1341
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:46,480
The rain has stopped.

1342
00:54:46,486 --> 00:54:48,020
- Yes. - The sky has become clear.

1343
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:49,620
- It's so sunny. - We could ski now.

1344
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:52,220
- The weather is unpredictable. - It's a shame.

1345
00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:56,260
You should pay for...

1346
00:54:56,263 --> 00:54:58,730
yesterday's paragliding.

1347
00:54:58,732 --> 00:55:00,100
(It must be expensive.)

1348
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,600
How much was it?

1349
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:03,300
It cost...

1350
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,745
810 dollars in total.

1351
00:55:05,105 --> 00:55:06,740
- 270 dollars per person. - That's expensive.

1352
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,340
- But it was worth it. - Really?

1353
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:11,470
Let's see the vote result.

1354
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:12,610
Did everyone vote?

1355
00:55:12,612 --> 00:55:14,325
Yes, everyone did.

1356
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:17,850
- Everyone? - But...

1357
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:20,850
In the first round, they plotted against me.

1358
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:23,220
No way. You can't say that.

1359
00:55:23,223 --> 00:55:26,065
(Cold)

1360
00:55:26,593 --> 00:55:27,720
Look at her smile.

1361
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:30,890
- She's so nasty. - She's so mean to Se Chan.

1362
00:55:30,897 --> 00:55:33,060
What did I do? Let's do this.

1363
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:34,700
First...

1364
00:55:34,701 --> 00:55:35,960
(This is the first vote to decide who'll pay for paragliding.)

1365
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:38,700
The paragliding cost 810 dollars.

1366
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:39,700
(Who'll have the honor of taking the first vote?)

1367
00:55:39,706 --> 00:55:40,985
They wrote it down on this paper.

1368
00:55:41,575 --> 00:55:43,710
- Yang Se Chan. - Hold on.

1369
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,070
(Se Chan gets one vote.)

1370
00:55:45,078 --> 00:55:48,380
Hold on. The paper is ripped in half.

1371
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:51,295
You ripped it.

1372
00:55:51,818 --> 00:55:54,225
(This morning, they checked out from the hotel.)

1373
00:55:54,654 --> 00:55:56,250
(We're one.)

1374
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:58,235
(Can I have a piece of the paper?)

1375
00:55:58,592 --> 00:55:59,790
(They got paper from the staff...)

1376
00:55:59,793 --> 00:56:02,135
(and had half each.)

1377
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:03,635
Han Na.

1378
00:56:04,097 --> 00:56:05,630
(He said "Han Na"...)

1379
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:08,205
(and wrote down Se Chan's name.)

1380
00:56:08,902 --> 00:56:11,045
(It gets found out because of the voting paper.)

1381
00:56:11,137 --> 00:56:13,845
I saw you rip it. Haha.

1382
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,640
Didn't you have a good time stargazing?

1383
00:56:16,643 --> 00:56:17,985
(I'm sorry.)

1384
00:56:18,044 --> 00:56:19,910
It's the same paper. Haha.

1385
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:21,310
(This is the second vote.)

1386
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:23,010
(How dare you...)

1387
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:24,010
It's the same paper.

1388
00:56:24,017 --> 00:56:26,225
(Se Chan wrote Haha's name as well.)

1389
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:29,395
(Everybody's the same in Running Man.)

1390
00:56:30,957 --> 00:56:34,535
- I knew this would happen. - It was obvious but still.

1391
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:37,635
Next. Ha Dong Hoon.

1392
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:39,960
Who's that?

1393
00:56:39,966 --> 00:56:41,645
We don't know who that is.

1394
00:56:41,701 --> 00:56:43,600
- Can you tell from the writing? - Next.

1395
00:56:43,603 --> 00:56:45,570
It's Haha.

1396
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,185
- Okay, good. - It's me this time.

1397
00:56:48,208 --> 00:56:50,010
I told you we should be on the same side.

1398
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,385
You guys planned it together.

1399
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:54,710
It's me again. Look, it's me.

1400
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,055
All right. Next is...

1401
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:58,825
Kim Jong Kook.

1402
00:56:59,185 --> 00:57:01,320
- Who? - Who wrote my name again?

1403
00:57:01,321 --> 00:57:04,420
- They betrayed you. - You didn't write your own name.

1404
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,690
- You wrote my name again? - I know. These three teamed up.

1405
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:08,835
Last one.

1406
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:12,430
- It's Hong Jin Young. - What?

1407
00:57:12,432 --> 00:57:13,845
(Last vote is for Jin Young?)

1408
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,600
From the three friends,

1409
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,700
- No way. - one person betrayed you.

1410
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:20,200
- That's not true. - Really?

1411
00:57:20,206 --> 00:57:21,700
- See? - Who is it? You?

1412
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,340
- No way, Ji Hyo. - Han Na.

1413
00:57:23,343 --> 00:57:25,315
- Is it you? - I'm disappointed.

1414
00:57:25,345 --> 00:57:27,855
- I swear. - Was it Haha?

1415
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:28,980
You swear?

1416
00:57:28,982 --> 00:57:32,110
- It's her then. - Is it Ji Hyo?

1417
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:34,050
- Ji Hyo. - You wrote Jong Kook's name then.

1418
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:35,925
(She tells the truth.)

1419
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,095
(They finally figure out the culprit.)

1420
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,420
(It came from Han Na's conviction.)

1421
00:57:40,427 --> 00:57:43,005
Ji Hyo, that was good.

1422
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:44,475
- You're a great actress. - Goodness.

1423
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,675
Jin Young is not smiling properly.

1424
00:57:47,701 --> 00:57:49,260
- I see. Okay. - Jin Young.

1425
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:50,630
- Okay. - She looked at me.

1426
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,500
- This is war. - That's not why.

1427
00:57:52,505 --> 00:57:53,800
- This is war. - I told you.

1428
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,200
Betray them. I didn't like you three hanging out together.

1429
00:57:56,209 --> 00:57:59,015
That's not why. It looked like Jong Kook had a lot of money.

1430
00:57:59,379 --> 00:58:01,740
- I thought he could pay it all. - She's so direct.

1431
00:58:01,748 --> 00:58:04,480
- Good job. - Yes, this is war. Okay.

1432
00:58:04,484 --> 00:58:07,065
I'll let it go because your pants are so shiny.

1433
00:58:08,688 --> 00:58:12,090
We'll decide who'll pay through Ghost Leg.

1434
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:13,590
(They'll decide who'll pay through Ghost Leg.)

1435
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:16,690
There are numbers 1 through 6. You'll select multiple numbers...

1436
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:20,275
according to the number of votes you received, and it'll decide who pays.

1437
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:22,360
Haha, you have three votes.

1438
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:25,800
Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Jin Young has one each.

1439
00:58:25,805 --> 00:58:28,300
- You never know. - Han Na.

1440
00:58:28,308 --> 00:58:29,400
We did good.

1441
00:58:29,409 --> 00:58:32,255
(They go ahead with the lottery.)

1442
00:58:32,712 --> 00:58:34,955
This is Haha,

1443
00:58:35,749 --> 00:58:37,550
- and this is Se Chan. - Okay.

1444
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,610
(Se Chan is on the left, and Haha is on the right.)

1445
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:40,520
- I'll open them at the same time. - I did good so far.

1446
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,380
- If I get picked, I'll be so sad. - We're going at the same time.

1447
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,590
- I'm going. - One.

1448
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,835
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1449
00:58:46,493 --> 00:58:49,165
(Who will be the nice one to pay?)

1450
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:15,880
- I'm going. - One.

1451
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,135
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1452
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:20,805
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1453
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:24,135
(Who will be the nice one to pay?)

1454
00:59:24,164 --> 00:59:25,435
Se Chan!

1455
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:28,245
(Se Chan gets selected.)

1456
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:31,730
- Why didn't I go? - Se Chan,

1457
00:59:31,738 --> 00:59:34,640
thank you for the paragliding.

1458
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:37,810
- Thank you for the paragliding. - I beat the odds.

1459
00:59:37,811 --> 00:59:39,555
That was unbelievable.

1460
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:41,080
I didn't even go paragliding.

1461
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:45,050
- So Se Chan will pay. - He didn't even go.

1462
00:59:45,051 --> 00:59:47,325
I didn't even get to see the parachute.

1463
00:59:47,687 --> 00:59:50,265
Paragliding was great.

1464
00:59:50,323 --> 00:59:51,420
Haha didn't get picked?

1465
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:52,565
(This is not the end. Who'll pay for the helicopter?)

1466
00:59:53,526 --> 00:59:58,075
This is unbelievable. We're here in the UK to do this.

1467
00:59:58,131 --> 00:59:59,690
I didn't know we'd actually come.

1468
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,005
I'll be good.

1469
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:04,815
(There is a daily limit, so only 3 people can ride it.)

1470
01:00:04,838 --> 01:00:08,540
You're here for wing walking. Do you see the plane behind you?

1471
01:00:08,541 --> 01:00:10,685
- I did. - We know already.

1472
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:12,355
I'm too terrified to look.

1473
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:15,055
I don't even want to look at it.

1474
01:00:15,248 --> 01:00:17,350
I can't digest right now.

1475
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:18,350
(They'll have to decide on who'll go.)

1476
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:22,180
These two have such big differences.

1477
01:00:22,188 --> 01:00:24,790
- This is... - 24 or 16 is a big difference.

1478
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:28,465
Kwang Soo's is this small. Look at his.

1479
01:00:28,828 --> 01:00:31,775
- That's true. It's so small. - Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1480
01:00:31,931 --> 01:00:34,505
- Seok Jin... - Yes.

1481
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:37,075
- and So Min, come here. - Come here.

1482
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,840
You 2 have to decide. 1 of you get the 24 spaces,

1483
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,840
- and the other one gets 16 spaces. - Right.

1484
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:48,640
- So three of us have to go? - Right.

1485
01:00:48,648 --> 01:00:51,380
- Hurry. Can we decide quickly? - Go ahead and decide.

1486
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:52,650
- Use this. - Shall we use this?

1487
01:00:52,652 --> 01:00:53,980
- Use this. - Can we use this?

1488
01:00:53,987 --> 01:00:56,320
- Yes, you can. - If you lose, you get this one.

1489
01:00:56,322 --> 01:00:58,420
- Seok Jin, do rock-paper-scissors. - Let's go.

1490
01:00:58,424 --> 01:01:00,420
- This is the match of the century. - You can go first.

1491
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:02,535
The loser goes first. Rock-paper-scissors

1492
01:01:02,562 --> 01:01:04,835
Rock-paper-scissors

1493
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:06,405
(Seok Jin loses, so he goes first.)

1494
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:07,460
She won.

1495
01:01:07,467 --> 01:01:08,460
(He gets nervous.)

1496
01:01:08,468 --> 01:01:09,605
"She won."

1497
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:12,600
This is the first one. It won't pop out.

1498
01:01:12,605 --> 01:01:14,285
(Seok Jin gets 1 in.)

1499
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:16,915
I think it'll pop out.

1500
01:01:17,577 --> 01:01:19,055
Please, please.

1501
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:23,225
Seok Jin has no intentions of being nice.

1502
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:25,350
He's cold-hearted.

1503
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:26,410
- "Cold-hearted"? - Let's go.

1504
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:29,080
- I think it'll pop out. - Here.

1505
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:30,150
(The loser will get one step closer to wing walking.)

1506
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:32,665
(Seok Jin is cursing her and wishing she'd lose.)

1507
01:01:33,092 --> 01:01:34,605
(I don't know anymore.)

1508
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:37,035
(It pops out.)

1509
01:01:39,065 --> 01:01:41,845
(So Min gets the pirate roulette with 16 spaces.)

1510
01:01:42,101 --> 01:01:44,615
(He's truly happy that he won.)

1511
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,345
(This can't be true.)

1512
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:49,285
That was her second try.

1513
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:53,070
At least we didn't come to this.

1514
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,625
Imagine if this was the main game.

1515
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:58,750
So Min, how could this happen?

1516
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:00,980
We have a chance. We have enough chances.

1517
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:02,780
I'm getting anxious now too. Look at her.

1518
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:03,790
We have to get through seven turns.

1519
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:06,420
This one's not good. It'll pop out in three tries.

1520
01:02:06,426 --> 01:02:07,565
This one's mine.

1521
01:02:07,994 --> 01:02:09,305
It came out.

1522
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:11,430
(There are 24 spaces, and it came out in 1 try.)

1523
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:13,630
- That took 1 try. - I stuck 1 in.

1524
01:02:13,633 --> 01:02:15,930
- I stuck 1 in. - You never know.

1525
01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:17,800
You never know. Nobody knows.

1526
01:02:17,804 --> 01:02:19,530
You never know. You really don't.

1527
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:20,685
(Da Hee and Kwang Soo start to get hopeful.)

1528
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,115
(She's losing it.)

1529
01:02:24,877 --> 01:02:27,525
This is not how it's supposed to work.

1530
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:30,155
This is unbelievable.

1531
01:02:30,483 --> 01:02:32,495
I'm getting nervous already.

1532
01:02:32,518 --> 01:02:34,880
This is a lottery. You never know what'll happen.

1533
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:36,665
This is...

1534
01:02:37,123 --> 01:02:39,365
This is insane.

1535
01:02:39,826 --> 01:02:43,360
Pirate Roulette Death Match will decide...

1536
01:02:43,363 --> 01:02:45,690
the three people who'll receive the penalty.

1537
01:02:45,698 --> 01:02:47,975
(Pirate Roulette Death Match will decide the 3 people.)

1538
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:51,470
Let me be the other half.

1539
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:55,440
We'll start with the person who has the most number of badges.

1540
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:58,240
The person whose pirate pops out has to go wing walking.

1541
01:02:58,244 --> 01:03:01,910
(Kwang Soo goes first, and they'll take turns inserting a sword.)

1542
01:03:01,914 --> 01:03:03,185
We'll start with last place.

1543
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:07,250
Let's start Pirate Roulette Death Match.

1544
01:03:07,253 --> 01:03:09,025
Kwang Soo is in sixth place, so he goes first.

1545
01:03:09,222 --> 01:03:11,220
- Don't touch your head. - Go ahead.

1546
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:12,565
Kwang Soo.

1547
01:03:13,226 --> 01:03:15,635
- I think it'll pop out at once. - Show them, Kwang Soo.

1548
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:17,790
I think it will too.

1549
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:19,530
- Kwang Soo, let's finish this. - Show them.

1550
01:03:19,532 --> 01:03:20,630
(Kwang Soo, show us the miracle again.)

1551
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,100
Look at his face.

1552
01:03:22,101 --> 01:03:23,700
- Three people, right? - Yes.

1553
01:03:23,703 --> 01:03:25,200
Kwang Soo, show them.

1554
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:27,145
(Trembling)

1555
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,585
It'll pop out.

1556
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,515
It's so small.

1557
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,440
It's over. Hurry up.

1558
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:35,325
If you fake it, your mom will scold you.

1559
01:03:35,548 --> 01:03:37,710
- No? - He inserted it.

1560
01:03:37,717 --> 01:03:39,780
- He's fine. - Put it in fully.

1561
01:03:39,786 --> 01:03:42,620
Push it in. Push it in fully.

1562
01:03:42,622 --> 01:03:44,295
(Ticking)

1563
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:48,205
(Kwang Soo survives the 1st round.)

1564
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:51,205
(Screaming)

1565
01:03:52,632 --> 01:03:53,930
I only need three people.

1566
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,130
(If 3 people lose, Kwang Soo gets exempt.)

1567
01:03:55,134 --> 01:03:56,800
- I only need three people. - I'm getting nervous.

1568
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:58,630
- I'm getting scared. - Three people. Please!

1569
01:03:58,638 --> 01:04:01,385
I'm getting nervous watching.

1570
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:02,615
I'm so nervous.

1571
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:04,370
Da Hee.

1572
01:04:04,377 --> 01:04:06,115
(Next is Da Hee, also with 8 spaces.)

1573
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,540
Please lose.

1574
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:09,785
(As long as it's not me)

1575
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:13,755
(They all hope the pirate pops out.)

1576
01:04:14,153 --> 01:04:16,365
(It pops out.)

1577
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:18,120
Please lose.

1578
01:04:18,124 --> 01:04:20,765
(Da Hee gets the penalty.)

1579
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,360
(What happened?)

1580
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:26,830
- 1 died. - We have 1 loser.

1581
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,460
- Hold on. - Yes!

1582
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:30,745
(Okay, one person lost.)

1583
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:32,600
(Yes, one died.)

1584
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:35,270
Stop it. Don't say one person died.

1585
01:04:35,274 --> 01:04:37,340
One person lost. My bad.

1586
01:04:37,343 --> 01:04:38,640
- I'm sorry. - Hold on.

1587
01:04:38,644 --> 01:04:40,170
Can I go one more time?

1588
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:41,710
- No. - Just one time.

1589
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:42,840
Move over!

1590
01:04:42,849 --> 01:04:44,050
(Stop with that nonsense.)

1591
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,480
- Move over. - Go away!

1592
01:04:45,485 --> 01:04:47,795
This is business.

1593
01:04:47,987 --> 01:04:51,350
- I came this far. - Kwang Soo.

1594
01:04:51,357 --> 01:04:53,465
You can't do this to me.

1595
01:04:54,093 --> 01:04:56,765
- This is not possible. - Da Hee gets the penalty.

1596
01:04:57,029 --> 01:05:00,460
- Jae Seok. - Please, not now. Not now.

1597
01:05:00,466 --> 01:05:01,900
It'll pop out. I'm sure.

1598
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,600
(Jae Seok has 16 spaces. Will he survive?)

1599
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:05,445
Please, please.

1600
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:09,500
(There is so much tension.)

1601
01:05:09,509 --> 01:05:10,770
It'll be quick.

1602
01:05:10,776 --> 01:05:12,985
- I know. - Okay.

1603
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:15,925
- This is too awful to look. - Please.

1604
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:19,350
(Jae Seok survives the 1st round.)

1605
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:21,095
Jae Seok survived too?

1606
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:22,480
(Thank you, Pirate.)

1607
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:24,295
- Jae Seok. - Why didn't it work for me?

1608
01:05:24,957 --> 01:05:27,390
We have 1 person, so we only need 2 more.

1609
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:29,360
I don't want to look at their faces.

1610
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:30,630
We only need two more people.

1611
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:32,930
- So Min, do you want to go with me? - Please.

1612
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:35,175
(No.)

1613
01:05:35,434 --> 01:05:37,300
(She's about to cry.)

1614
01:05:37,303 --> 01:05:39,070
So Min, what's going on with you?

1615
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,145
- What is wrong with you? - Gosh.

1616
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:44,115
Gosh, I'm so mad.

1617
01:05:44,377 --> 01:05:46,340
- So Min is getting started. - I can't do this.

1618
01:05:46,345 --> 01:05:48,325
- Why are you crying? - Calm down.

1619
01:05:48,514 --> 01:05:51,380
- I'm so mad. I was in first place. - Why are you crying?

1620
01:05:51,384 --> 01:05:54,050
- So Min. - You can win.

1621
01:05:54,053 --> 01:05:56,865
- I have eight spaces. - I didn't have any badges.

1622
01:05:57,256 --> 01:06:00,865
So Min, your snot came out.

1623
01:06:01,027 --> 01:06:03,135
(Really?)

1624
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:05,890
Please. Let's do this.

1625
01:06:05,898 --> 01:06:07,645
- You don't know yet, So Min. - Seriously.

1626
01:06:08,301 --> 01:06:10,645
- You don't know yet. - Please.

1627
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,575
- All right. - You don't know yet.

1628
01:06:12,738 --> 01:06:14,070
- My hand is shaking. - You don't know yet.

1629
01:06:14,073 --> 01:06:15,440
I don't think that's it, So Min.

1630
01:06:15,441 --> 01:06:17,515
(Will So Min survive?)

1631
01:06:18,511 --> 01:06:19,940
- What? - You're fine.

1632
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:21,280
(I got it?)

1633
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,885
You were crying, and you're laughing now.

1634
01:06:23,616 --> 01:06:25,580
(What is she doing?)

1635
01:06:25,585 --> 01:06:27,320
I'm going to check if you're okay.

1636
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,125
(Should Da Hee check?)

1637
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:30,665
There's nothing.

1638
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,720
Please pop out.

1639
01:06:32,725 --> 01:06:34,190
I want Seok Jin's to pop out.

1640
01:06:34,193 --> 01:06:35,420
If these two lose, it's over.

1641
01:06:35,428 --> 01:06:37,530
I hope Seok Jin and Sang Yeob lose so that it'll be over.

1642
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,460
I hope they lose so that this will end.

1643
01:06:39,465 --> 01:06:41,030
Are you allowed to do that?

1644
01:06:41,033 --> 01:06:42,805
- It's coming. - Okay.

1645
01:06:43,936 --> 01:06:46,230
(Seok Jin survives the 1st round.)

1646
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:48,140
- I have many spaces, - Why is he so good?

1647
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,585
so I'll just go.

1648
01:06:49,909 --> 01:06:53,715
I'll pick a random spot. Goodness.

1649
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:55,685
- That scared me. - Hey, hey.

1650
01:06:56,282 --> 01:06:57,525
Kwang Soo, it's you.

1651
01:06:58,384 --> 01:07:01,325
(Is it already my turn again?)

1652
01:07:02,655 --> 01:07:03,720
Wasn't that quick?

1653
01:07:03,723 --> 01:07:04,720
(It's Kwang Soo's turn again. He has 7 spaces left.)

1654
01:07:04,724 --> 01:07:06,395
I have acid reflux.

1655
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:07,935
I have a heartburn.

1656
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:10,690
(What's Kwang Soo going to do?)

1657
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:12,030
You have one-seventh of a chance.

1658
01:07:12,031 --> 01:07:15,600
Kwang Soo's is smaller than this one's head.

1659
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:17,275
(His chance of survival is that small too.)

1660
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:19,315
Da Hee?

1661
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:20,600
You're done.

1662
01:07:20,606 --> 01:07:22,415
(He finds something.)

1663
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:25,785
- Why is she here again? - You're done. What are you doing?

1664
01:07:26,646 --> 01:07:28,285
(He's serious.)

1665
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:31,795
I can't do this. What should I do?

1666
01:07:32,418 --> 01:07:33,810
- It's too small. - It is.

1667
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:35,280
I keep looking at it, and it's too small.

1668
01:07:35,288 --> 01:07:38,235
Please let me pass one more round.

1669
01:07:39,792 --> 01:07:43,635
(If he survives this round, he really has a chance.)

1670
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:47,035
- That's not it. - I have a bad feeling.

1671
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:48,875
Kwang Soo, that's not it.

1672
01:07:50,169 --> 01:07:52,730
(He carefully inserts it.)

1673
01:07:52,738 --> 01:07:54,815
- Insert it. - I have a bad feeling.

1674
01:07:55,141 --> 01:07:56,440
- Hurry up. - Goodness.

1675
01:07:56,442 --> 01:07:58,785
Are you allowed to take it out?

1676
01:07:59,745 --> 01:08:02,310
(He already inserted it.)

1677
01:08:02,315 --> 01:08:03,840
Hurry up.

1678
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:05,795
(It pops out.)

1679
01:08:06,085 --> 01:08:08,425
(Kwang Soo gets to go wing walking.)

1680
01:08:09,322 --> 01:08:12,050
(The pirate is here.)

1681
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:14,590
Hey, you can't do that.

1682
01:08:14,593 --> 01:08:15,960
Yes.

1683
01:08:15,961 --> 01:08:17,990
(The pirate did his job.)

1684
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:20,635
Wait, so it's 1 out of us 4.

1685
01:08:20,866 --> 01:08:23,530
He knew the pirate would pop out,

1686
01:08:23,536 --> 01:08:25,475
so he was shaking his hand.

1687
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,470
(Am I the only one who heard the click?)

1688
01:08:30,476 --> 01:08:32,610
(Shaking)

1689
01:08:32,611 --> 01:08:34,240
Why did you pick this space?

1690
01:08:34,246 --> 01:08:36,140
I told you that wasn't it.

1691
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:39,010
(Kwang Soo gets to go wing walking.)

1692
01:08:39,018 --> 01:08:40,450
There's one space left.

1693
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:44,090
Please, Jae Seok. Please.

1694
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,820
I already said I don't have to get married. What should I bet now?

1695
01:08:46,826 --> 01:08:49,820
I don't have to move next year, so please.

1696
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:51,330
I won't get a car.

1697
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,675
(Please.)

1698
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,600
Pop out.

1699
01:08:55,601 --> 01:08:56,930
(Even people with 24 spaces are not safe now.)

1700
01:08:56,936 --> 01:08:59,830
(This game has So Min's new house and car on the line.)

1701
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:01,345
(Clicking)

1702
01:09:01,874 --> 01:09:03,785
(Jae Seok survives.)

1703
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:07,310
- He's so good. - This is so nerve-wrecking.

1704
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:09,485
- So Min. - Which one should I pick?

1705
01:09:10,049 --> 01:09:12,250
I have 1 out of 24 chances, and I'm still nervous.

1706
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:13,480
I know. Me too.

1707
01:09:13,486 --> 01:09:15,050
(These two are done for.)

1708
01:09:15,054 --> 01:09:16,680
So Min.

1709
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:18,590
(She's in a desperate situation.)

1710
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:19,920
That's not it.

1711
01:09:19,925 --> 01:09:21,835
(Clicking)

1712
01:09:22,228 --> 01:09:23,220
(So Min survives.)

1713
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:24,890
You survived.

1714
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,360
- It's okay, right? - What happened?

1715
01:09:26,365 --> 01:09:28,105
- Did you insert it fully? - Yes, I did.

1716
01:09:28,768 --> 01:09:32,130
(So Min survives, and the remaining two are not relaxed anymore.)

1717
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:34,600
Seok Jin keeps on checking.

1718
01:09:34,607 --> 01:09:37,470
- Please pop out. Pop out. - Let's finish this.

1719
01:09:37,476 --> 01:09:40,370
- Pop out. - Let's finish this with Seok Jin.

1720
01:09:40,379 --> 01:09:41,940
- Pop out. - Finish this.

1721
01:09:41,947 --> 01:09:43,310
(If he loses here, it'll be really funny.)

1722
01:09:43,315 --> 01:09:44,655
Pop out.

1723
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:46,380
No, please.

1724
01:09:46,385 --> 01:09:47,820
(Will this be dramatic?)

1725
01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:49,480
(Clicking)

1726
01:09:49,488 --> 01:09:52,150
When it comes to something decisive,

1727
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,065
- he never loses. - My heart.

1728
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:58,475
I'm so relaxed. Let's get it.

1729
01:09:58,564 --> 01:09:59,890
Sang Yeob, make it pop out.

1730
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:01,245
(Flinching)

1731
01:10:01,734 --> 01:10:02,830
(Clicking)

1732
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:04,730
(Sang Yeob looked scared, but he gets lucky and survives.)

1733
01:10:04,737 --> 01:10:06,145
Jae Seok, it's you.

1734
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:08,800
This is going fast now. It's going fast.

1735
01:10:08,808 --> 01:10:11,770
The faster we do this, Jae Seok and So Min...

1736
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:15,210
(The chances of Jae Seok and So Min's losing increase.)

1737
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:16,440
Jae Seok.

1738
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,850
(The staff suddenly laughs.)

1739
01:10:17,850 --> 01:10:21,365
(Why are the members and the staff laughing?)

1740
01:10:21,987 --> 01:10:24,520
(Come here.)

1741
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:27,150
(Brother, you need to rest.)

1742
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:29,265
Who do you think it'll be?

1743
01:10:29,462 --> 01:10:30,620
Who do you think will join you?

1744
01:10:30,629 --> 01:10:32,375
(What do you guys think?)

1745
01:10:32,631 --> 01:10:33,990
It's him.

1746
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:35,700
(The Grim Reapers of Wing Walking thinks it'll be Jae Seok.)

1747
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:37,045
He'll lose this turn.

1748
01:10:37,837 --> 01:10:39,330
Accept it.

1749
01:10:39,338 --> 01:10:40,575
(Excuse me. Let's go.)

1750
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:45,740
(There is one-fourteenth of a chance of losing. Will Jae Seok survive?)

1751
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:47,370
(Clicking)

1752
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:50,210
(Jae Seok survives.)

1753
01:10:50,216 --> 01:10:51,755
Did you insert it fully?

1754
01:10:52,351 --> 01:10:53,480
So Min.

1755
01:10:53,486 --> 01:10:55,550
(She can feel the vibe.)

1756
01:10:55,554 --> 01:10:58,590
(So Min, go on the plane with us.)

1757
01:10:58,591 --> 01:11:01,520
(It's not scary at all. I heard it's a lot of fun.)

1758
01:11:01,527 --> 01:11:03,990
Go! Go away, both of you.

1759
01:11:03,996 --> 01:11:06,605
(She's mad.)

1760
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:09,660
(She yelled at the Grim Reapers. Will she be okay?)

1761
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:11,030
So Min, be bold.

1762
01:11:11,036 --> 01:11:13,470
- How many spaces did you use up? - Should I try the front one?

1763
01:11:13,472 --> 01:11:14,785
(So Min, join us.)

1764
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:17,140
(There are 14 spaces left. Will she beat the odds?)

1765
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:18,640
Let me try this one.

1766
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:21,580
(There are 14 spaces left. Will she beat the odds?)

1767
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,680
(Clicking)

1768
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,040
She survived.

1769
01:11:24,049 --> 01:11:26,410
(So Min survives.)

1770
01:11:26,418 --> 01:11:28,580
(So Min survived again. It's Seok Jin's turn.)

1771
01:11:28,587 --> 01:11:31,450
I feel like once the red swords run out, my life will too.

1772
01:11:31,457 --> 01:11:33,720
(He has a bad feeling.)

1773
01:11:33,726 --> 01:11:35,065
I have two left.

1774
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:37,135
I feel like I'll be gone.

1775
01:11:37,763 --> 01:11:39,030
Go.

1776
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:40,635
(Seok Jin goes all-in with the red swords.)

1777
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,130
I don't have to go on it.

1778
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:44,630
(I trust the red swords.)

1779
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:47,640
(Ringing)

1780
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,840
- I have a bad feeling. - I feel weird.

1781
01:11:49,842 --> 01:11:52,170
- He got a call. - It's for him.

1782
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:55,410
Seok Jin, get ready. Oh, dear.

1783
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:56,585
(Clicking)

1784
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,825
Why is Seok Jin not losing?

1785
01:11:59,885 --> 01:12:01,365
It's my turn.

1786
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,165
- Sang Yeob. - Let's get it.

1787
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:07,935
(He survives easily.)

1788
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,705
I'm still calm.

1789
01:12:11,096 --> 01:12:12,460
(It's Jae Seok's turn once again.)

1790
01:12:12,464 --> 01:12:13,690
How many does he have left?

1791
01:12:13,699 --> 01:12:16,775
- Don't waste your time. Hurry up. - Don't do that.

1792
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:19,615
You never know.

1793
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,885
He has 12 left. One-twelfth of a chance.

1794
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:23,570
He has one-twelfth of a chance of losing.

1795
01:12:23,576 --> 01:12:26,670
- Please. - My heart is pounding.

1796
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:27,840
(He's cautious.)

1797
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:28,880
(Goodness)

1798
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:30,210
I have a bad feeling.

1799
01:12:30,215 --> 01:12:32,710
(Why was Jae Seok surprised?)

1800
01:12:32,718 --> 01:12:35,350
- I think it'll pop out. What now? - He can feel it. It'll pop out.

1801
01:12:35,354 --> 01:12:37,450
(If Jae Seok loses, the 3 people will be decided.)

1802
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:39,465
(Join us.)

1803
01:12:39,758 --> 01:12:42,405
I think it'll pop out. What now?

1804
01:12:42,461 --> 01:12:44,020
Please insert it fully.

1805
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:47,160
(Will he survive? Or will he be the last person to go wing walking?)

1806
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:50,800
(It pops out.)

1807
01:12:50,803 --> 01:12:52,000
Yes!

1808
01:12:52,004 --> 01:12:55,445
(Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Da Hee will go wing walking.)

1809
01:12:56,075 --> 01:12:59,285
(We survived!)

1810
01:12:59,712 --> 01:13:04,080
(Why did you come so late?)

1811
01:13:04,083 --> 01:13:06,795
(Crying)

1812
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:13,335
(Seok Jin, So Min, and Sang Yeob are automatically exempted.)

1813
01:13:13,959 --> 01:13:16,220
(The UK is the best.)

1814
01:13:16,228 --> 01:13:19,830
According to the results of Pirate Roulette Death Match,

1815
01:13:19,832 --> 01:13:21,760
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and Da Hee will go wing walking.

1816
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:24,975
(Jae Seok gets to go wing walking.)

1817
01:13:25,838 --> 01:13:29,415
(Jae Seok, Da Hee, and Kwang Soo have been selected.)

1818
01:13:30,442 --> 01:13:31,840
- However... - What?

1819
01:13:31,844 --> 01:13:32,985
What? Is there something else?

1820
01:13:33,245 --> 01:13:34,780
(Is there something else?)

1821
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,080
- What do you mean? - What is it?

1822
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:38,810
- What is it? - Why are you saying that?

1823
01:13:38,817 --> 01:13:40,380
Please tell me now.

1824
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:42,720
- Why is there always a "however"? - Tell me.

1825
01:13:42,721 --> 01:13:47,320
However, wing walking's speed is 128km per h...

1826
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:49,490
at an altitude of 457m.

1827
01:13:49,495 --> 01:13:54,945
It also involves vertical descent and twists and lasts for 10 minutes.

1828
01:13:56,135 --> 01:13:58,130
(The original wing walking is at an altitude of 457m. It has twists...)

1829
01:13:58,137 --> 01:14:01,070
(and vertical descent. In total, it lasts 10 minutes.)

1830
01:14:01,073 --> 01:14:03,770
- 10 minutes is too long. - What's a twist?

1831
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:06,515
- Doesn't it go like this? - Like this.

1832
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:08,340
It goes like this.

1833
01:14:08,347 --> 01:14:10,010
That won't do.

1834
01:14:10,015 --> 01:14:12,910
Since you're all faint-hearted,

1835
01:14:12,918 --> 01:14:16,250
we divided up wing walking into three levels.

1836
01:14:16,255 --> 01:14:18,695
(They divided the original wing walking into 3 levels.)

1837
01:14:18,724 --> 01:14:22,135
Level one, flying at an altitude of 457m for 5 minutes.

1838
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:25,790
- You just fly. - It's just upright?

1839
01:14:25,798 --> 01:14:26,860
That one's okay.

1840
01:14:26,865 --> 01:14:28,600
- You're just at the altitude. - I can do that.

1841
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,445
Level two, all of the above with twists in addition.

1842
01:14:32,471 --> 01:14:34,540
- As long as it doesn't drop. - And...

1843
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:37,370
level three, experiencing all of the above for 10 minutes.

1844
01:14:37,376 --> 01:14:40,240
There are twists and the vertical descent.

1845
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:41,740
I'm scared of that. I can't do the vertical descent.

1846
01:14:41,747 --> 01:14:45,450
- These are the three levels. - I didn't know that existed.

1847
01:14:45,451 --> 01:14:47,525
(They'll pick an envelope each.)

1848
01:14:47,553 --> 01:14:50,825
Who will like to go first? You can do rock-paper-scissors.

1849
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:52,690
- Should a lady go first? - Yes.

1850
01:14:52,691 --> 01:14:54,120
- No. - It's up to you.

1851
01:14:54,126 --> 01:14:55,690
- I don't want to do that. - What?

1852
01:14:55,694 --> 01:14:57,690
(He refuses sternly.)

1853
01:14:57,696 --> 01:15:00,260
- Kwang Soo. - To be honest,

1854
01:15:00,265 --> 01:15:02,700
Da Hee got chosen first. That means she finished last.

1855
01:15:02,701 --> 01:15:04,200
That means she finished last.

1856
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:06,400
You son... How could you...

1857
01:15:06,405 --> 01:15:08,140
(What?)

1858
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,745
- That was a swear word. - She used a swear word.

1859
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:11,070
- That was a swear word. - Da Hee used a swear word.

1860
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:13,055
Not even my mom says that to me.

1861
01:15:13,412 --> 01:15:15,540
I've never heard such a word from my mom either.

1862
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:17,180
- She used a swear word. - Seriously.

1863
01:15:17,182 --> 01:15:21,350
I meant to say that you are an individualist,

1864
01:15:21,353 --> 01:15:23,380
but the word came out wrong.

1865
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,235
- I didn't use a swear word. - It can't be helped.

1866
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,760
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - You lack consideration.

1867
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,420
- The winner decides the order. - That's right.

1868
01:15:29,428 --> 01:15:30,560
(The winner decides the order.)

1869
01:15:30,562 --> 01:15:31,905
You are a coward.

1870
01:15:33,065 --> 01:15:34,330
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1871
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:37,045
(Da Hee loses.)

1872
01:15:37,603 --> 01:15:39,230
(The winner decides the order.)

1873
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:42,385
Kwang Soo, it would be better if you don't choose the envelope.

1874
01:15:42,574 --> 01:15:44,240
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1875
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:47,455
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1876
01:15:47,913 --> 01:15:48,940
(Please let me pick first.)

1877
01:15:48,947 --> 01:15:50,425
Stop that.

1878
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:53,380
Kwang Soo, it would be better if you don't choose the envelope.

1879
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:54,925
- Da Hee, go first. - Okay.

1880
01:15:55,387 --> 01:15:57,250
I will go after Da Hee.

1881
01:15:57,256 --> 01:15:58,290
(Da Hee picks first.)

1882
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:00,195
You get whichever one you touch.

1883
01:16:01,393 --> 01:16:05,075
Da Hee, please open the envelope and reveal the level.

1884
01:16:05,264 --> 01:16:07,960
- Please let it be level 1. - I really hope she gets level 1.

1885
01:16:07,966 --> 01:16:10,860
(She wants to avoid the vertical descent of level 3.)

1886
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:12,230
(Which level does Da Hee have?)

1887
01:16:12,237 --> 01:16:13,370
Which level do you have?

1888
01:16:13,372 --> 01:16:15,040
(Which level does Da Hee have?)

1889
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,315
Which level do you have?

1890
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:18,285
Which level do you have?

1891
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:20,970
(Da Hee gets level 2.)

1892
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:22,155
It's level two.

1893
01:16:22,714 --> 01:16:25,155
(Level 2 is out of the picture.)

1894
01:16:25,584 --> 01:16:28,495
(10 minutes of flying and twists)

1895
01:16:29,555 --> 01:16:31,790
- Why is this happening to me? - It's either level 1 or level 3.

1896
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,735
Even among them, the competition is fierce.

1897
01:16:34,026 --> 01:16:35,960
Of course it is. Everyone wants the standard flying.

1898
01:16:35,961 --> 01:16:37,460
- The standard flying. - The competition is fierce.

1899
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:39,190
- It's either level 1 or level 3. - You know,

1900
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:41,260
those levels are very different.

1901
01:16:41,266 --> 01:16:43,430
- Level 3 lasts twice as long. - He's right.

1902
01:16:43,435 --> 01:16:44,630
Who wants to pick first?

1903
01:16:44,636 --> 01:16:45,845
I get to decide, right?

1904
01:16:46,572 --> 01:16:48,585
Tell Kwang Soo to pick. He is unlucky.

1905
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:50,215
- Tell Kwang Soo to pick. - Please let me get the leftover.

1906
01:16:50,742 --> 01:16:52,610
Pick first.

1907
01:16:52,611 --> 01:16:53,670
(In that case, pick first.)

1908
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:55,210
Kwang Soo, pick the one on the right.

1909
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:57,240
- Pick the one on the right. - I'll choose last.

1910
01:16:57,249 --> 01:16:59,455
It's the one on the right. Pick it.

1911
01:16:59,518 --> 01:17:00,925
Please don't let him...

1912
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,120
Pick the one on the right.

1913
01:17:03,121 --> 01:17:04,990
Kwang Soo, think carefully. You don't want the vertical descent.

1914
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:06,890
Level three has the dive.

1915
01:17:06,892 --> 01:17:08,765
- I have a gut feeling. - No. That one is level three.

1916
01:17:09,428 --> 01:17:10,820
- Pick the one on the right. - Kwang Soo.

1917
01:17:10,829 --> 01:17:12,290
(Kwang Soo ignores So Min and goes for the left.)

1918
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:13,790
Now...

1919
01:17:13,799 --> 01:17:15,205
(Don't say I didn't tell you.)

1920
01:17:16,168 --> 01:17:17,745
- Open them at the same time. - Is that mine?

1921
01:17:18,537 --> 01:17:19,730
Open them at the same time.

1922
01:17:19,738 --> 01:17:22,240
(Here, Jae Seok.)

1923
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:25,210
You shouldn't have touched it!

1924
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:27,240
The result will be bad since Kwang Soo touched it.

1925
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:29,325
You shouldn't have touched it!

1926
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:30,755
- I... - Hey!

1927
01:17:30,782 --> 01:17:32,710
- I only touched the tip. - You shouldn't have touched it.

1928
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,920
Kwang Soo's touch will change the result drastically.

1929
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,195
When you touch the envelope, the content changes to level three!

1930
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:40,550
- No, it doesn't. - Yes, it does.

1931
01:17:40,559 --> 01:17:41,920
- I was startled too. - You are unlucky.

1932
01:17:41,927 --> 01:17:44,120
I saw Kwang Soo touch the envelope and thought, "He shouldn't do that."

1933
01:17:44,129 --> 01:17:45,375
I only delivered it to you.

1934
01:17:45,597 --> 01:17:46,835
I only delivered it to you.

1935
01:17:47,599 --> 01:17:51,270
On the count of three, open the envelopes.

1936
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:53,700
1 will fly for 5 minutes at the standard altitude.

1937
01:17:53,705 --> 01:17:57,315
The other will fly for 10 minutes with twists and vertical descent.

1938
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,355
One.

1939
01:17:59,645 --> 01:18:02,110
(5 minutes of flying at the standard altitude...)

1940
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:04,440
(versus 10 minutes of twists and vertical descent)

1941
01:18:04,449 --> 01:18:05,450
Two.

1942
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,780
(What are their fates?)

1943
01:18:06,785 --> 01:18:07,920
Three.

1944
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,580
(Kwang Soo gets level 3.)

1945
01:18:10,589 --> 01:18:11,835
Jae Seok has level one.

1946
01:18:12,658 --> 01:18:15,435
(Level 3 is the worst stage of the worst penalty.)

1947
01:18:16,028 --> 01:18:17,860
I told you to make Kwang Soo pick first.

1948
01:18:17,863 --> 01:18:20,275
- You should have listened to me. - It doesn't make sense to be happy.

1949
01:18:20,499 --> 01:18:21,760
I told you so.

1950
01:18:21,767 --> 01:18:23,845
It doesn't make sense to be happy.

1951
01:18:24,369 --> 01:18:26,900
What's the point? I have to wing walk anyway.

1952
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:29,670
- I told you to make him pick first. - Kwang Soo worried...

1953
01:18:29,675 --> 01:18:31,770
about getting chosen for wing walking last night.

1954
01:18:31,777 --> 01:18:33,710
A man's mind is fickle.

1955
01:18:33,712 --> 01:18:35,925
I am so happy about picking level one.

1956
01:18:36,648 --> 01:18:37,840
That means you will go first.

1957
01:18:37,849 --> 01:18:38,880
(Jae Seok, Da Hee, Kwang Soo)

1958
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:40,010
You will go first.

1959
01:18:40,018 --> 01:18:43,720
I will now introduce the pilot who will fly the aircraft.

1960
01:18:43,722 --> 01:18:45,020
- He looks dependable. - He looks cool.

1961
01:18:45,023 --> 01:18:46,150
(Mike Dennis, wing walking pilot)

1962
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:47,960
- He looks dependable. - He looks cool.

1963
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,020
(Over 30 years, 3,000 wing walkers have ridden his plane.)

1964
01:18:49,027 --> 01:18:50,435
- It's nice to meet you. - What a handsome man!

1965
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:52,130
- Hello. - Hi.

1966
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:55,360
Who is going to be riding on the wing of my plane?

1967
01:18:55,367 --> 01:18:56,775
- 3 people. - 3 people.

1968
01:18:57,169 --> 01:18:58,745
- These people here? - Yes.

1969
01:18:59,004 --> 01:19:01,800
Who is level 1? Who is level 2?

1970
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:03,970
- Level 1, level 2, and level 3. - Level 1, level 2, and level 3.

1971
01:19:03,976 --> 01:19:05,855
- And you are level three? - Yes.

1972
01:19:06,345 --> 01:19:08,580
(Sighing)

1973
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:11,450
(He shakes his head.)

1974
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,880
He seems to know that Kwang Soo is hopeless.

1975
01:19:14,886 --> 01:19:17,050
- What does that mean? - He took one look and sighed.

1976
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:20,265
- He seems to know. - Congratulations on level three.

1977
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:21,490
- Level 1? - Yes. Level 1.

1978
01:19:21,493 --> 01:19:23,060
- It's fine. - It's fine?

1979
01:19:23,061 --> 01:19:24,905
Level 2? It's a little bit...

1980
01:19:25,597 --> 01:19:26,690
- Level 3. - Level 3?

1981
01:19:26,698 --> 01:19:29,500
(It gives me a headache.)

1982
01:19:29,501 --> 01:19:31,030
(Why does it give you a headache?)

1983
01:19:31,036 --> 01:19:32,300
Actually, it's fine. You will be fine.

1984
01:19:32,304 --> 01:19:34,230
You will all enjoy it. It's lovely.

1985
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,000
- It's a beautiful day. - Yes.

1986
01:19:36,008 --> 01:19:38,740
- What is not to enjoy? - It's true. It's a beautiful day.

1987
01:19:38,744 --> 01:19:40,370
However, I am faint-hearted.

1988
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:42,855
Tell him that they are cowards.

1989
01:19:43,081 --> 01:19:44,780
Three of them are cowards.

1990
01:19:44,783 --> 01:19:46,725
Tell him that I wet my bed until I was in ninth grade.

1991
01:19:46,852 --> 01:19:48,265
Okay. Fine.

1992
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:50,120
He needs to have a change of clothes...

1993
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:52,320
because I don't want the damp on my seat.

1994
01:19:52,324 --> 01:19:54,420
How about he ride it without any pants on?

1995
01:19:54,426 --> 01:19:56,920
(In that case...)

1996
01:19:56,928 --> 01:19:58,590
So Min, you...

1997
01:19:58,597 --> 01:20:00,475
You changed a lot in 10 minutes.

1998
01:20:00,532 --> 01:20:02,575
You changed a lot in 10 minutes.

1999
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:07,370
- Of course he can't wear it. - It's heavy.

2000
01:20:07,372 --> 01:20:10,185
Yes, I can. If you give it to me, I will demonstrate.

2001
01:20:10,442 --> 01:20:12,755
I knew it would be impossible.

2002
01:20:12,778 --> 01:20:15,155
So if you put this on your head...

2003
01:20:15,347 --> 01:20:16,880
(Are you watching, Se Chan?)

2004
01:20:16,882 --> 01:20:18,125
It suits you.

2005
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:20,010
Okay.

2006
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:24,325
When we fly at 140km per h,

2007
01:20:24,723 --> 01:20:26,035
the wind...

2008
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:27,790
The wind.

2009
01:20:27,793 --> 01:20:29,890
(The wind pushes the mask.)

2010
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:31,020
Is the wind that strong?

2011
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:33,130
Was the demonstration necessary?

2012
01:20:33,131 --> 01:20:36,030
(I doubt the demonstration was necessary.)

2013
01:20:36,034 --> 01:20:38,175
- Seriously. - He almost fell backward.

2014
01:20:38,236 --> 01:20:40,400
- I understood. - Did you see his face...

2015
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:41,500
when he was pushed back?

2016
01:20:41,506 --> 01:20:44,515
Please tell him that we understand some English.

2017
01:20:44,843 --> 01:20:46,510
- You will go like this. - I see. I see.

2018
01:20:46,511 --> 01:20:47,970
- His neck will break. - I understand.

2019
01:20:47,979 --> 01:20:50,280
All right. Please give a big hand...

2020
01:20:50,282 --> 01:20:51,950
- to the pilot. - Thank you.

2021
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,250
- Please take good care of us. - Thank you.

2022
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:54,480
- See you in a minute. - Yes. See you.

2023
01:20:54,486 --> 01:20:55,850
(It's not dangerous. Don't worry.)

2024
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:57,720
Don't worry. Let me check.

2025
01:20:57,722 --> 01:20:58,850
(His pants are still dry.)

2026
01:20:58,857 --> 01:21:00,035
Please take good care of me.

2027
01:21:00,926 --> 01:21:02,290
(The wing walking experience is just around the corner.)

2028
01:21:02,294 --> 01:21:03,560
I can see that you are very scared,

2029
01:21:03,562 --> 01:21:06,690
but this is an extreme sport many European women enjoy.

2030
01:21:06,698 --> 01:21:08,460
- It's not dangerous. - Like I said,

2031
01:21:08,467 --> 01:21:10,175
they actually wanted to do this.

2032
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:12,700
We are doing this for a penalty. There is a big difference.

2033
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,470
So I can't have drug-induced sleep, can I?

2034
01:21:14,473 --> 01:21:15,615
No.

2035
01:21:15,774 --> 01:21:19,770
The employees keep telling us there is no need for this fuss.

2036
01:21:19,778 --> 01:21:21,515
There is no need for this fuss?

2037
01:21:21,713 --> 01:21:25,480
Tell them that they don't know anything about me.

2038
01:21:25,484 --> 01:21:27,750
Since Jae Seok is going first,

2039
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:30,080
he will recount his experience when he comes back.

2040
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:31,420
Gosh, Jae Seok is going now.

2041
01:21:31,423 --> 01:21:32,935
- Jae Seok. - Good luck.

2042
01:21:33,358 --> 01:21:34,620
Jae Seok, let's go.

2043
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:36,220
(For the safe wing walking experience,)

2044
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:41,700
(the pilot flies the aircraft first without a passenger.)

2045
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,805
(Warming up)

2046
01:21:44,436 --> 01:21:48,145
(This is really happening.)

2047
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:52,040
They should make sure there is enough gas for three people.

2048
01:21:52,043 --> 01:21:53,910
(Come to think of it...)

2049
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:55,780
(Annoyed)

2050
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:57,280
- I am serious. - Stop it.

2051
01:21:57,282 --> 01:21:59,050
If we include the test flight, the plane will fly four time.

2052
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:00,580
- They know what they are doing. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

2053
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:01,825
Stop it.

2054
01:22:01,853 --> 01:22:03,850
The gas tank looks small.

2055
01:22:03,855 --> 01:22:05,135
I am worried about your safety.

2056
01:22:05,157 --> 01:22:07,335
- It took off. - It took off in an instant.

2057
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:09,190
- It took off. - I will be on the wing.

2058
01:22:09,194 --> 01:22:10,460
- It's in the air. - It's in the air.

2059
01:22:10,462 --> 01:22:12,005
I can see it.

2060
01:22:12,097 --> 01:22:14,430
This is no joke.

2061
01:22:14,432 --> 01:22:16,545
(Since this is a test flight, the plane takes off gently.)

2062
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:18,100
It's really high.

2063
01:22:18,103 --> 01:22:20,545
(It looks pretty okay.) (My goodness.)

2064
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:24,240
(It suddenly makes a twist.)

2065
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:25,810
(Leaning)

2066
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:29,010
Are they doing that?

2067
01:22:29,014 --> 01:22:31,380
(Are we doing that?)

2068
01:22:31,383 --> 01:22:33,380
Look at that. It's scary.

2069
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:34,655
Was that a twist?

2070
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:36,420
- No. - It wasn't a twist.

2071
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:37,980
- Apparently, it was nothing. - It wasn't a twist?

2072
01:22:37,989 --> 01:22:39,050
To change direction...

2073
01:22:39,057 --> 01:22:40,665
It was a twist.

2074
01:22:41,193 --> 01:22:42,660
It was a twist.

2075
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:45,205
If that's not a twist, what is?

2076
01:22:45,697 --> 01:22:47,135
- It's landing. - It's descending.

2077
01:22:47,566 --> 01:22:48,730
It's landing.

2078
01:22:48,733 --> 01:22:50,675
Jae Seok, it's time to put on your gear.

2079
01:22:51,336 --> 01:22:52,370
Goggles.

2080
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:54,645
(Jae Seok puts on the safety gear.)

2081
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:58,470
(Here are your goggles.)

2082
01:22:58,476 --> 01:22:59,540
You look cool.

2083
01:22:59,544 --> 01:23:00,840
(You look cool.)

2084
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:03,325
- Hold on. - Don't be ridiculous!

2085
01:23:03,448 --> 01:23:04,855
He doesn't look cool.

2086
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:06,295
Do you take us for fools?

2087
01:23:06,952 --> 01:23:08,320
Who said that?

2088
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,780
Him...

2089
01:23:09,788 --> 01:23:11,125
- and him... - Do you think this looks cool?

2090
01:23:11,423 --> 01:23:12,665
Do you think this looks cool?

2091
01:23:12,857 --> 01:23:14,965
It's not much different from the grasshopper mask.

2092
01:23:16,194 --> 01:23:20,030
(Kwang Soo fastens the helmet straps.)

2093
01:23:20,031 --> 01:23:22,500
- For goodness' sake! - I am sorry.

2094
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,100
(He gets pinched.)

2095
01:23:24,102 --> 01:23:26,030
You were warned.

2096
01:23:26,037 --> 01:23:28,130
- Don't pinch him. - I didn't know.

2097
01:23:28,139 --> 01:23:29,685
I didn't know. I thought it was my finger.

2098
01:23:30,008 --> 01:23:32,970
- They can't even do this right. - The goggles...

2099
01:23:32,978 --> 01:23:35,155
I will be back.

2100
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:36,925
Don't worry about me.

2101
01:23:37,082 --> 01:23:39,610
(He is confident.)

2102
01:23:39,618 --> 01:23:41,225
Let's go.

2103
01:23:41,353 --> 01:23:45,620
I can do this! I can do this! I can do this!

2104
01:23:45,624 --> 01:23:47,920
(He collapses.)

2105
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:49,690
(That's a lie.)

2106
01:23:49,694 --> 01:23:50,820
Kwang Soo.

2107
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:51,960
I can't do this.

2108
01:23:51,963 --> 01:23:53,360
(I can't do this.)

2109
01:23:53,365 --> 01:23:54,875
Kwang Soo.

2110
01:23:55,567 --> 01:23:58,800
(Even if he can't, he must.)

2111
01:23:58,803 --> 01:24:02,385
(Jae Seok gets on the plane first.)

2112
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,785
See you soon, Jae Seok.

2113
01:24:04,576 --> 01:24:06,040
See you soon, Jae Seok.

2114
01:24:06,044 --> 01:24:07,755
(Hesitant)

2115
01:24:09,047 --> 01:24:11,755
(Worried)

2116
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:16,320
(With heavy feet,)

2117
01:24:16,321 --> 01:24:19,835
(he arrives at the plane.)

2118
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:21,805
- You can follow me so far. - Okay.

2119
01:24:23,295 --> 01:24:26,105
(He finally sets foot on the plane.)

2120
01:24:26,498 --> 01:24:29,445
(He is incredibly nervous.)

2121
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:31,505
He will actually do it.

2122
01:24:31,636 --> 01:24:32,945
- He is on the wing. - My goodness.

2123
01:24:33,271 --> 01:24:34,675
He will actually do it.

2124
01:24:35,173 --> 01:24:36,940
(With the staff's help, he carefully climbs on top.)

2125
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:39,415
Hold this through the next step.

2126
01:24:41,379 --> 01:24:44,110
Put your left foot sideways.

2127
01:24:44,115 --> 01:24:45,910
- Stand up when you are done. - My goodness.

2128
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:47,450
(My goodness.)

2129
01:24:47,452 --> 01:24:51,280
(He can't help but sigh.)

2130
01:24:51,289 --> 01:24:52,320
I am so scared.

2131
01:24:52,324 --> 01:24:54,495
(I am so scared.)

2132
01:24:55,226 --> 01:24:58,635
- That's it. - Darn it. It's scary even up here.

2133
01:25:00,198 --> 01:25:01,190
Come here.

2134
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,100
(He's merely on the wing, but he's already far away from the ground.)

2135
01:25:05,103 --> 01:25:07,545
- Take your seat. - This is so scary.

2136
01:25:07,939 --> 01:25:09,340
He's in big trouble. What will he do?

2137
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:11,440
- He must be really scared. - He's really scared.

2138
01:25:11,443 --> 01:25:13,170
- Right. It looks like it. - Jae Seok is...

2139
01:25:13,178 --> 01:25:16,940
(They're worried because he easily gets scared to begin with.)

2140
01:25:16,948 --> 01:25:18,980
Okay. Sit, and make yourself comfortable.

2141
01:25:18,983 --> 01:25:20,325
I'm seriously scared.

2142
01:25:20,919 --> 01:25:21,920
It's scary to be up here.

2143
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,065
(Jae Seok boards the plane.)

2144
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:24,380
(Everything is ready.)

2145
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:27,120
Take that again. It looks good. Have fun.

2146
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,005
(How's the level 1 wing walking?)

2147
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:34,335
The weather is great today, but why must I get this penalty?

2148
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:36,175
I'm so scared.

2149
01:25:37,769 --> 01:25:41,815
(Jae Seok has asked that question way too many times.)

2150
01:25:42,707 --> 01:25:45,285
(Captain Mike gets into the cockpit.)

2151
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:47,770
(Are you ready for the level 1?)

2152
01:25:47,779 --> 01:25:49,525
Jae Seok, Mike got in.

2153
01:25:49,581 --> 01:25:51,610
- Jae Seok, he got in. - Jae Seok.

2154
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:53,525
Good luck. It's just starting.

2155
01:25:54,486 --> 01:25:56,150
Why is the weather so good?

2156
01:25:56,154 --> 01:25:57,680
(It's very sunny.)

2157
01:25:57,689 --> 01:25:59,395
He's about to start the engine.

2158
01:26:00,592 --> 01:26:01,590
Take off.

2159
01:26:01,593 --> 01:26:03,805
(He's ready and starts the engine.)

2160
01:26:06,698 --> 01:26:10,905
(The propeller starts spinning at last.)

2161
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:14,845
(He can feel the vibrations with his entire body.)

2162
01:26:14,973 --> 01:26:17,415
- Here it goes. It's spinning. - He's surprised.

2163
01:26:17,509 --> 01:26:20,315
- He's surprised. Oh, my. My gosh. - He's surprised.

2164
01:26:21,312 --> 01:26:23,440
Gosh, this is crazy. Goodness. This is so scary.

2165
01:26:23,448 --> 01:26:24,955
(Screaming)

2166
01:26:26,584 --> 01:26:30,120
(After warming up the engine,)

2167
01:26:30,121 --> 01:26:35,705
(he finally takes off.)

2168
01:26:36,594 --> 01:26:37,590
It's shaking a lot.

2169
01:26:37,595 --> 01:26:39,590
(The plane begins to move to the take-off point.)

2170
01:26:39,597 --> 01:26:40,935
It's shaking too much.

2171
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:43,100
(His entire body can feel the vibrations.)

2172
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:44,705
I'm going to die now.

2173
01:26:48,506 --> 01:26:50,745
Since it's a penalty, it's not like I can't get out of this.

2174
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:53,015
The weather is amazing today.

2175
01:26:55,513 --> 01:27:01,125
(The plane races in a stretched-out runway.)

2176
01:27:01,252 --> 01:27:02,280
(It arrives at the take-off point.)

2177
01:27:02,287 --> 01:27:05,165
My gosh, I haven't been as nervous as I am now.

2178
01:27:05,356 --> 01:27:06,635
This is really happening.

2179
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:09,665
I think he's going to fly now. It got windy all of a sudden.

2180
01:27:10,195 --> 01:27:12,805
- Why did it get so windy suddenly? - The wind is suddenly blowing.

2181
01:27:13,398 --> 01:27:15,075
I'm a bit worried about him.

2182
01:27:16,568 --> 01:27:17,760
(I can't get off now.)

2183
01:27:17,769 --> 01:27:20,800
I can't get off now. What should I do?

2184
01:27:20,805 --> 01:27:22,200
(Without having the chance to get off,)

2185
01:27:22,207 --> 01:27:25,015
(the plane begins to accelerate.)

2186
01:27:26,311 --> 01:27:29,655
(Clenching his teeth tightly)

2187
01:27:31,316 --> 01:27:32,510
Here it comes. Here it comes.

2188
01:27:32,517 --> 01:27:34,595
(They're completely fixated on him.)

2189
01:27:38,189 --> 01:27:40,995
(The wheels are off the ground.)

2190
01:27:41,593 --> 01:27:43,265
It's flying. It's flying.

2191
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,900
(After racing at an incredibly fast speed,)

2192
01:27:48,900 --> 01:27:51,305
(the plane successfully takes off.)

2193
01:27:52,303 --> 01:27:55,215
- It's in the air. - It's flying. It's in the air.

2194
01:27:55,306 --> 01:27:57,185
- He's sitting there. - Oh, no.

2195
01:27:59,777 --> 01:28:02,080
(As soon as it takes off,)

2196
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,955
(the plane soars higher and higher.)

2197
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,925
(Flinching)

2198
01:28:11,756 --> 01:28:13,790
- Look at his hand. - He's waving at us.

2199
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:16,105
(Look over there. He's waving at us.)

2200
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:17,935
(Jae Seok, come back safely.)

2201
01:28:20,398 --> 01:28:23,475
(The plane changes direction.)

2202
01:28:24,202 --> 01:28:26,700
- Jae Seok is doing that. - My gosh.

2203
01:28:26,704 --> 01:28:28,315
Goodness, he looks so cool.

2204
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,155
(No, he doesn't sound cool at all.)

2205
01:28:35,613 --> 01:28:38,810
(At about an altitude of 450m,)

2206
01:28:38,816 --> 01:28:44,425
(Jae Seok is enduring the speed of 120km per h without any gear.)

2207
01:28:47,492 --> 01:28:52,335
It's so scary. It's so scary.

2208
01:28:53,998 --> 01:28:55,845
(You're scared? We didn't even start yet.)

2209
01:28:57,936 --> 01:29:01,870
(He suddenly changes direction.)

2210
01:29:01,873 --> 01:29:03,445
(What's happening?)

2211
01:29:04,108 --> 01:29:09,585
(It flies to the open plains after switching its course.)

2212
01:29:11,416 --> 01:29:14,195
- It's high. It's really high. - Jae Seok is on top of the plane.

2213
01:29:14,652 --> 01:29:18,425
- It's different from earlier. - Jae Seok, you're so cool.

2214
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:23,290
- The plane doesn't waver at all. - Right, right.

2215
01:29:23,294 --> 01:29:25,265
Will it feel shaky on top of the plane?

2216
01:29:25,663 --> 01:29:29,330
(Shaky, my foot. The vibrations are fiery.)

2217
01:29:29,334 --> 01:29:30,330
My nose is runny.

2218
01:29:30,335 --> 01:29:32,645
(Gosh, my nose is runny.)

2219
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,045
My nose is running, and I'm drooling.

2220
01:29:36,874 --> 01:29:41,255
Hey, by the way, the view is so beautiful.

2221
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:46,795
This is so beautiful. It's scary,

2222
01:29:47,218 --> 01:29:48,920
but it's really beautiful.

2223
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:51,725
(The scenery makes him forget about his fears for a short while.)

2224
01:29:53,124 --> 01:29:55,565
It's really beautiful.

2225
01:29:56,361 --> 01:30:00,735
It's really scary, but it's really beautiful.

2226
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,100
(This must be why...)

2227
01:30:05,103 --> 01:30:07,700
(I'm going through with this penalty.)

2228
01:30:07,705 --> 01:30:09,770
It's really scary, but...

2229
01:30:09,774 --> 01:30:13,015
(The plane shoots out the steams.)

2230
01:30:14,012 --> 01:30:18,310
(A line of a beautiful cloud is drawn over the amazing scenery.)

2231
01:30:18,316 --> 01:30:19,810
- What's that? - What is it?

2232
01:30:19,817 --> 01:30:23,995
(They're amazed. Gosh, that's very beautiful.)

2233
01:30:24,756 --> 01:30:27,790
It's really scary, but it's really beautiful.

2234
01:30:27,792 --> 01:30:33,160
(He barely opens his eyes and enjoys the beautiful view of England.)

2235
01:30:33,164 --> 01:30:38,275
Freedom! Freedom!

2236
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:43,385
(He shouts, "freedom".)

2237
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,300
Freedom.

2238
01:30:45,309 --> 01:30:47,855
(His Freedom Cheer is full of sentiments of a middle-aged man.)

2239
01:30:48,179 --> 01:30:50,885
- He's raising his hands. Yes. - He's doing that with his hands.

2240
01:30:51,182 --> 01:30:53,580
- He feels at ease. He's relaxed. - Right.

2241
01:30:53,584 --> 01:30:55,125
He's doing something with his hands.

2242
01:30:55,753 --> 01:30:56,780
I'm about to throw up.

2243
01:30:56,788 --> 01:30:59,465
(Relaxed? As if! His nervousness is at its peak.)

2244
01:31:00,124 --> 01:31:03,090
(If level 1 is this scary, how scary is level 3?)

2245
01:31:03,094 --> 01:31:07,860
I want to return!

2246
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:12,275
(He does Seol Kyung Gu's impression in the middle of the penalty.)

2247
01:31:12,603 --> 01:31:14,300
I want to go home now.

2248
01:31:14,305 --> 01:31:16,245
(Let's stop wing walking now.)

2249
01:31:17,575 --> 01:31:19,410
- Jae Seok endured it. - Here he comes.

2250
01:31:19,410 --> 01:31:20,685
He got off.

2251
01:31:20,878 --> 01:31:23,785
- My gosh, it's over. - He's coming here. It's over.

2252
01:31:24,415 --> 01:31:27,050
(Fluttering)

2253
01:31:27,051 --> 01:31:32,090
(He returns like a paper doll after riding it for 5 minutes.)

2254
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:33,895
(The plane lands safely.)

2255
01:31:35,593 --> 01:31:37,935
(Tears of relief)

2256
01:31:39,263 --> 01:31:41,930
(Welcome. We're proud of you, Jae Seok.)

2257
01:31:41,933 --> 01:31:43,800
(He's worried about level 3.)

2258
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:44,945
That was amazing.

2259
01:31:45,269 --> 01:31:47,545
Jae Seok, are you okay?

2260
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:49,500
Let's go back and talk.

2261
01:31:49,507 --> 01:31:51,145
(Sighing)

2262
01:31:51,175 --> 01:31:52,170
(Sniffling)

2263
01:31:52,176 --> 01:31:53,555
Kwang Soo, let's go back and talk.

2264
01:31:54,112 --> 01:31:55,315
Did you cry?

2265
01:31:55,413 --> 01:31:57,185
I have a lot to talk about. Let's go back.

2266
01:31:57,915 --> 01:32:00,510
- Did you cry, Jae Seok? - You must be curious.

2267
01:32:00,518 --> 01:32:02,420
- Did you cry? - Let's go back to our spots.

2268
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:04,150
- He must've really cried. - I think he really cried.

2269
01:32:04,155 --> 01:32:06,650
Why did he cry? Why did Jae Seok cry?

2270
01:32:06,657 --> 01:32:08,795
- Why did he cry? - Everyone came for him.

2271
01:32:09,093 --> 01:32:10,090
This...

2272
01:32:10,094 --> 01:32:12,135
(He begins sharing his experience.)

2273
01:32:12,864 --> 01:32:14,675
It's a long story.

2274
01:32:15,032 --> 01:32:18,445
Snot from my nose... And my mouth...

2275
01:32:19,604 --> 01:32:22,175
(The attack of the wind)

2276
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:25,300
(He couldn't close his mouth due to the attack of the wind.)

2277
01:32:25,309 --> 01:32:26,310
The wind?

2278
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,655
(He couldn't close his mouth due to the attack of the wind.)

2279
01:32:28,813 --> 01:32:31,180
- It was fast. How fast was it? - Poor Jae Seok.

2280
01:32:31,182 --> 01:32:33,255
- Poor you. Are you serious? - Da Hee.

2281
01:32:33,351 --> 01:32:36,780
But by the way, it was beautiful.

2282
01:32:36,788 --> 01:32:38,680
Did you see?

2283
01:32:38,689 --> 01:32:40,390
- No, I didn't. - Then...

2284
01:32:40,391 --> 01:32:42,490
- He's making it up. - Why are you lying?

2285
01:32:42,493 --> 01:32:46,505
Be quiet. I could feel that it must've been beautiful.

2286
01:32:46,697 --> 01:32:49,900
You had your eyes closed when you took off. How would you know?

2287
01:32:49,901 --> 01:32:52,775
But at that instant... Everyone.

2288
01:32:53,037 --> 01:32:54,970
I wouldn't have had regrets if I died then.

2289
01:32:54,972 --> 01:32:56,600
- It was that good? - Really?

2290
01:32:56,607 --> 01:32:58,340
- You'd think that once. - Just once?

2291
01:32:58,342 --> 01:33:00,415
- That's when you must be careful. - What?

2292
01:33:00,711 --> 01:33:04,310
That's when you must get a grip. You might lose your mind then.

2293
01:33:04,315 --> 01:33:07,555
- That's when it'd go either way. - I did it. I got myself together.

2294
01:33:07,718 --> 01:33:09,480
- You must be careful. - In the middle, you did this.

2295
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:12,080
- At that time, it got higher. - That's what I thought you did.

2296
01:33:12,089 --> 01:33:14,995
- You spread out your arms. - I was determined to do that.

2297
01:33:15,026 --> 01:33:17,560
- It'd be a photo of my lifetime. - "A photo of my lifetime".

2298
01:33:17,562 --> 01:33:19,430
But from down here, it didn't look that cool.

2299
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:21,960
(A photo of your lifetime? It didn't look that cool.)

2300
01:33:21,966 --> 01:33:24,930
It looked like you fainted and was fluttering in the wind.

2301
01:33:24,936 --> 01:33:26,800
(You were fluttering.)

2302
01:33:26,804 --> 01:33:29,185
- It wasn't what you imagined. - What's wrong with you?

2303
01:33:29,307 --> 01:33:33,255
Things are different up there. It's a battle against yourself up there.

2304
01:33:33,311 --> 01:33:35,085
You're closer to the sky than to the ground.

2305
01:33:35,313 --> 01:33:37,510
- What? What did you say? - What's up with him?

2306
01:33:37,515 --> 01:33:38,610
What are you saying?

2307
01:33:38,616 --> 01:33:41,325
The moment you lose your mind, it's over.

2308
01:33:41,586 --> 01:33:43,495
- Why would I lose my mind? - You brat!

2309
01:33:43,754 --> 01:33:46,535
- What? - I came back from the dead!

2310
01:33:47,191 --> 01:33:49,735
- What do you know? - Listen.

2311
01:33:49,994 --> 01:33:52,975
- Goodness. - Next up is Da Hee.

2312
01:33:53,297 --> 01:33:56,005
All right. Da Hee will try level two.

2313
01:33:56,067 --> 01:33:59,315
- She's going to do that? - That will include a twist.

2314
01:33:59,604 --> 01:34:01,400
(It's just getting started.)

2315
01:34:01,405 --> 01:34:04,700
(A flight at a different level will begin.)

2316
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:06,710
(It's even hard to watch.)

2317
01:34:06,711 --> 01:34:08,510
(Higher and faster)

2318
01:34:08,512 --> 01:34:10,185
(The ultimate flight will come.)

2319
01:34:11,616 --> 01:34:14,310
(And...)

2320
01:34:14,318 --> 01:34:17,795
(a night with the ghosts will be the grand finale of their trip.)

2321
01:34:18,422 --> 01:34:22,290
(Strange phenomena unfolds at the haunted castle.)

2322
01:34:22,293 --> 01:34:25,790
(They shouldn't have entered.)

2323
01:34:25,796 --> 01:34:27,560
(The members aren't invited.)

2324
01:34:27,565 --> 01:34:29,845
(What will happen to them?)

2325
01:34:32,403 --> 01:34:34,645
(They'll enjoy their luxurious trip in Switzerland to the fullest.)

2326
01:34:34,705 --> 01:34:37,500
(A Michelin chef will cook the meals himself.)

2327
01:34:37,508 --> 01:34:40,055
(This is the epitome of luxury.)

2328
01:34:40,945 --> 01:34:42,440
(However,)

2329
01:34:42,446 --> 01:34:45,710
(it's not over until it is.)

2330
01:34:45,716 --> 01:34:49,020
(The longest suspension bridge appears in sight before them.)

2331
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:52,295
(What will happen to the members on top of the bridge?)

2332
01:34:53,024 --> 01:34:56,065
(My gosh, if this clip doesn't air for a long time,)

2333
01:34:56,594 --> 01:34:59,135
(Grand Final)
