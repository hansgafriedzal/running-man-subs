1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,579
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:11,610
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:12,909
- It's the rainy season. - Hello.

4
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,319
- It's raining too heavily. - Do we go this way?

5
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:17,550
It's nice. It's pink.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,689
- The mood is pink today. - Okay, come on!

7
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,790
I found out through an article that we will have a couple race.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,899
- Many articles have been released. - Yes.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,700
It's impressive. The cast is impressive.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,800
- I didn't read the articles. - The curtains are colorful.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,599
- Okay. - It's a rainbow.

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,739
- The curtains are rainbow-colored. - This place smells like perfume.

13
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,109
(The legendary couple race begins now.)

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,309
Kwang Soo became the actor with 3,000,000 views.

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:42,980
- What do you mean? - His movie had 3,000,000 views.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,450
- Congratulations, Kwang Soo. - Congratulations.

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,749
Congratulations, Sang Woo.

18
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:49,550
Why would you congratulate him when I am right here?

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,789
The success of the movie is all thanks to Dong Il and Sang Woo.

20
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,120
- That's not true. - Congratulations, Sang Woo.

21
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:56,690
- I knew the movie would be a hit. - I am sick and tired of this.

22
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,090
- I knew the movie would be a hit. - That's right.

23
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,900
I will watch it when it's on IPTV.

24
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,700
- Haven't you watched it yet? - You should watch it.

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,729
- You should watch it. - I will watch it.

26
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,099
It's time to meet the guests who will join you for the race.

27
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:11,270
- That's right. - Please come on out.

28
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,709
- Will they come out at once? - Let's see.

29
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,310
- Hello. - What is up with this appearance?

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,110
- Hello. - When did you get here?

31
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,020
Chi Yul.

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,319
(With his explosive singing skills and a charming voice,)

33
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,050
(Hwang Chi Yul is making a name for himself all over Asia.)

34
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,020
It's Hwang Chi Yul! It's Hwang Chi Yul!

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,690
I will team up with him today.

36
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,030
- Did you decide to pick him? - Yes.

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,099
- She decided to pick him. - I call dibs on him.

38
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,369
(I call dibs on Chi Yul.)

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,569
That's too bad. You have to comply if she calls dibs on you.

40
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,599
- Really? - I call dibs on him.

41
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,910
Hearing her call dibs made me think, "Ji Hyo is pretty old."

42
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,310
- Speak for yourself! - "I call dibs on him."

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,479
It means the same thing as taking a pick.

44
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,220
- That's right. - The expression is really old.

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,989
Hwang Chi Yul isn't the only guest of the day.

46
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,390
Ji Hyo and So Min, please move behind the curtain.

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,319
- Ji Hyo and So Min, go ahead. - Okay.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,160
Go to red and orange.

49
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
You know which color to go to, right?

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,630
- Blue. - Okay.

51
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,169
(See you at the blue curtain.)

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,130
- I will go to the yellow curtain. - Blue.

53
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,970
She told him that she will be behind the blue curtain.

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,340
- The blue curtain. - Is Black Pink here?

55
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,979
I had no idea. Is Black Pink here?

56
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,479
- Haha loves Jennie of Black Pink. - Really?

57
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,109
She is so stylish.

58
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,319
(He is a big fan.)

59
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,079
- Haha is excited. - She is a city girl.

60
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,250
- Step back. - Jennie!

61
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,250
(Behind which curtain is Jennie, the stylish city girl?)

62
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,519
What is this?

63
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:37,259
- What is this? - Those are the childhood pictures.

64
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,630
Okay. A black and white picture belongs to Ji Hyo.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,829
There is no black and white picture.

66
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,099
- Orange is So Min. - Is it orange?

67
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,500
- Orange is So Min. - That's So Min.

68
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,740
- The one on the red is familiar. - Hold on.

69
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,169
- The one on the red looks old. - Even though it's colored,

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,440
- the background is too empty. - It must be Ji Hyo.

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,079
Isn't that Pohang?

72
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:58,310
- Imjin River. - Is it from the Joseon dynasty?

73
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,549
It looks like a picture from the Korean War.

74
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:02,949
- She was born in the 80s. - I am 100-percent sure.

75
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,150
- Let's see the second picture. - It's So Min.

76
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,889
- So Min. - I see Han Min Gwan.

77
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,090
(The baby who resembles Han Min Gwan is...)

78
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,590
- Jong Kook. - It's So Min.

79
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,690
- I see Han Min Gwan. - He says he sees Han Min Gwan.

80
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,329
This picture has So Min's characteristics.

81
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,799
She looks to the side.

82
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,699
- She still does that. - She doesn't do as she is told.

83
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,970
- She really doesn't. - I am sorry,

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,269
but we aren't curious about these two pictures.

85
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:26,310
(We aren't curious about these two pictures.)

86
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,710
- Hurry up. - Move on. Move on already.

87
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,710
(We just want Hwang Chi Yul.)

88
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,280
- This is driving me crazy. - Let's see the next picture.

89
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,750
- Her limbs are long. - She is stylish.

90
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,549
- This picture is old as well. - That's not true.

91
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:39,590
Is she Kim Mi Hwa?

92
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,789
- I think she is Kim Mi Hwa. - Everyone,

93
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,829
the 1st 3 pictures look like they were taken in the 80s.

94
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:47,000
- They do. - The swimming pool has that vibe.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,599
Yes, it does.

96
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,970
- This was taken in the 90s. - That's the S.E.S. hairstyle.

97
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,639
That's right. The clothes...

98
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,199
- and the hairpins... - Maybe she is Jisoo.

99
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,539
She looks like she has a temper.

100
00:03:57,539 --> 00:03:59,710
- Don't say that. - She looks feisty.

101
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,710
Why would you say that...

102
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,710
- upon seeing a child's picture? - I bet...

103
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,609
she was a stubborn child.

104
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,979
- She has distinct facial features. - Let's see the next picture.

105
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,590
I think this picture was taken...

106
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:13,620
- in the late 90s. - Her parents must've been rich.

107
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,920
- I have no idea. - I have no idea.

108
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,690
- She is... - Jennie! She is Jennie!

109
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,600
Her clothes are stylish even by today's standards.

110
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,899
She is Jennie.

111
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,569
- Her face has style. - Is she Jennie?

112
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,899
- She hasn't changed a lot. - This is like a work of art.

113
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,170
(The last picture)

114
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,399
- A professional took that picture. - Who is this?

115
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,310
- Who took this picture? - A professional took that picture.

116
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:33,909
I think she was a child actress.

117
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:37,610
It's time to decide the order in which you choose the picture.

118
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,610
- Okay. - Please, please.

119
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,750
- I don't want to be last. - Please.

120
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,589
As long as I am in the top five, I will be fine.

121
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,550
- Let's be in the top five. - Everyone.

122
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,889
- Your facial expressions... - Listen.

123
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:50,589
- I am really serious right now. - I won't place 6th or 7th.

124
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,259
Like I always say,

125
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:55,560
- the guests will leave after today. - That's right.

126
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,100
- It's still good to have guests. - That's right.

127
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,839
- Can I go first? - Pick a spoon.

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,009
- Don't look at the number. - The entire day depends on this.

129
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:06,310
- We are serious. - I have no idea.

130
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:09,110
Please!

131
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,880
- 1, 2, 3. - Please let it be 7.

132
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:13,079
- Three. - It's a good number.

133
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:15,250
- 5. - 5. That's good.

134
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,850
- Okay! - What is this?

135
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:19,350
(I can't believe I picked 6.)

136
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,519
Jennie! Jennie!

137
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:24,259
- I am sorry. - Which one is Jennie?

138
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:26,089
- Jennie. - Why would you be sorry?

139
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,600
- Your wife, Byul, is watching. - Oh, right.

140
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,430
- You are on TV. - That's right.

141
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,969
This episode will air.

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
First, Suk Jin...

143
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,469
- will choose his partner. - Partner up with So Min.

144
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,009
- I don't want to. - Your wife is watching.

145
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,779
She is a stranger when I leave the house.

146
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,709
"She is a stranger when I leave the house."

147
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,380
- Why would you say that? - Why would you say that?

148
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,620
- A stranger? - Why would you say that?

149
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,690
- That's how it is. - Right.

150
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,449
- Once I go home, we're a family. - Let's go.

151
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,620
- Let's go. - Come on, Suk Jin.

152
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,790
It will be nice to partner up with So Min.

153
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,060
(The choice is complete when you stand before the curtain.)

154
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,259
Number one.

155
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,399
- My goodness. - Okay.

156
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,399
(He goes toward the stubborn girl behind the green curtain.)

157
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,699
He made a choice.

158
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,839
Who is behind the green curtain?

159
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,540
- Did you hear that? - I heard that.

160
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,569
(Screaming)

161
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,909
Who is behind the green curtain?

162
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,709
- I am curious. - I am curious.

163
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,019
- The one behind the green curtain. - You are Suk Jin's partner.

164
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,219
- I will make you a star. - "I will make you a star."

165
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,219
(Suk Jin promises to make the guest a star.)

166
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,350
I am so nervous.

167
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,190
(A girl in twin buns)

168
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,089
- She has years of experiences. - The curtain is shaking.

169
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,459
- Hello. - Bora!

170
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,060
Bora.

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,569
- Bora. - Bora.

172
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:39,199
- It's Bora. - Give her an umbrella.

173
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,899
- What's wrong? - What is it?

174
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:43,810
- What's wrong? - It's okay.

175
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,540
I don't like you either. For goodness' sake.

176
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:51,149
I don't want you as my partner either.

177
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,810
What's wrong, Bora?

178
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,949
- It's Bora. - Bora is the first guest.

179
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,949
- Who is number two? - It's me.

180
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:00,990
- Kwang Soo. - Why is he so lucky these days?

181
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,029
- Don't go there. - Kwang Soo, don't pick Jisoo.

182
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,600
- Okay. - The blue curtain.

183
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:09,600
- Let's see who is behind it. - He's anticipating.

184
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,199
- Please come on out. - I can't believe you.

185
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,370
(Who is the girl?)

186
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,110
- It's Jennie. - Jennie.

187
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,579
(She shyly sticks out her head.)

188
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:26,819
- Se Chan, what's wrong? - Yes?

189
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:28,250
I am so jealous of him.

190
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,089
Gosh, I didn't know you would be behind the curtain.

191
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,690
Jennie!

192
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,790
(Jennie is the stylish member of Black Pink.)

193
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,159
Please come this way.

194
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:38,360
- Kwang Soo, stop smiling. - I am not smiling.

195
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,000
- I didn't choose her on purpose. - It's Jennie.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,800
She is incredibly stylish.

197
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,600
I feel like I am in New York.

198
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,370
- Stop it. - It happened this way.

199
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,180
- She is so stylish. She is great. - Stop it already.

200
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:54,209
Okay.

201
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,009
- Se Chan. - It's only the beginning.

202
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,110
- Se Chan, what are you doing? - Jisoo.

203
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,120
Jisoo.

204
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,350
- Jisoo. - Stop it already.

205
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,790
No. I will pick Jisoo.

206
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,360
- Jisoo? - Yes.

207
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,490
- Okay. Let's go. - Be good to Jisoo.

208
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,259
Be good to Jisoo.

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
Se Chan. You don't know where Jisoo is.

210
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,469
- It's confusing. - It's confusing.

211
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,199
(Either the blue curtain or the purple curtain is Jisoo.)

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,800
- Where is Jisoo? - It's a dilemma.

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,769
- It's confusing. - It's really confusing.

214
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,469
The girl at the stream is...

215
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,740
I don't think Jisoo is the girl at the stream.

216
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,110
- Jisoo. - Jisoo.

217
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,579
Jisoo. Let's take a look. 1, 2, 3.

218
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,580
(Is Se Chan's choice correct?)

219
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,750
- The light blue curtain. - The light blue curtain.

220
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,080
(Jisoo, it's me, Se Chan.)

221
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,620
- Hello. - What?

222
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,820
- Pyo Ye Jin. - Hello.

223
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,090
(A rising star with a unique charm, Pyo Ye Jin)

224
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,689
(She is a scene stealer who starred in popular dramas.)

225
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:48,200
(A talented actress who is making a name for herself, Pyo Ye Jin)

226
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,529
- "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim". - Ye Jin.

227
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,899
- Aren't you busy these days? - Pyo Ye Jin.

228
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,899
- I am not busy. - Really?

229
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:57,070
You know...

230
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,210
- Hold on. I am sorry. - Why do you look so unhappy?

231
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,279
Why did you ask her, "Who are you?"

232
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,179
- Seriously. - Hey. I mean, Ye Jin.

233
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,519
- It's an honest reaction. - Shall we go?

234
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,350
Why did you ask her, "Who are you?"

235
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,620
"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim".

236
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,159
- She is busy with the drama. - "What's Wrong with Secretary Kim".

237
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,590
This is incredible.

238
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,889
I am number four.

239
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,429
- Who is number five? - It's me.

240
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,700
- Jong Kook. - Jae Suk.

241
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,429
- Go to the orange curtain. - Go to the orange curtain.

242
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,529
- The thing is... - Come on.

243
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,370
You shine the most when you are with So Min.

244
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,210
My goodness. Listen.

245
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,070
- He's right though. - Why would I partner up with her?

246
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,480
- It's true. - She brings out the best in you.

247
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,409
Jae Suk, let's work. Come on, let's work.

248
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:36,509
- They're a funny couple. - This is...

249
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,950
Everyone can see that this is So Min's photo.

250
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:41,950
Then just keep running. When we tell you to stop, stop.

251
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:43,689
Just keep running.

252
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:45,120
- I like this idea. I like it. - Hold on a second.

253
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,360
- That didn't exist until now. - Just run.

254
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,189
- Just run back and forth. - Fine, I'll do it.

255
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,330
- That sounds like fun. - We'll close our eyes then.

256
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,730
- I'll do this for fun. - That's the spirit.

257
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,559
- I'll make it more interesting. - That's right.

258
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,799
- Keep running. - Okay.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,370
- I'll just keep running. - Haha, you should say, "stop".

260
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,070
- Haha will stop him. - Then I'll close my eyes.

261
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,399
- Okay. - Close your eyes, and stop him.

262
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,639
- The lady I stop at is my partner. - Okay.

263
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,970
Start.

264
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:07,139
Hold on a second.

265
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,779
Wait.

266
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,110
- If... - Stop!

267
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,610
(Stop!)

268
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,750
(Rushing)

269
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,179
No, what are you doing?

270
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,620
(When Haha stops him at the orange curtain,)

271
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,149
(he pretends not to have heard him and runs at full speed.)

272
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,759
- Why did you keep going? - What?

273
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,590
- We all saw what you did. - What?

274
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,659
- Haha said, "stop". - That defeats the purpose of this.

275
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:26,189
- Who said, "stop"? - Haha did.

276
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:27,799
- Why did we play this then? - Jae Suk.

277
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,929
- Haha had his back on you. - Okay.

278
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,669
- Let's do it again. Do it right. - Okay, okay.

279
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,070
- Turn around. Don't look. - I didn't tell him anything.

280
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
- Goodness. - Hey, let's do this instead.

281
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,539
Why don't you stand here and jump from side to side?

282
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll say, "stop", when you're jumping.

283
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,980
- I'll team up with 1 of the 2 here. - Yes, it's 1 of those 2.

284
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,250
Start.

285
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,179
Right foot, left foot...

286
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,049
(Moving side to side)

287
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,049
Right, left.

288
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,149
- Right, left. - Hey.

289
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:52,289
- Right, left. - You can't...

290
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,559
(Haha and Jae Suk become one body and mind.)

291
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,889
- You can't jump with me. - Right, left.

292
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,159
(What is this?)

293
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,960
- You can't jump with me. - Wait.

294
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,659
- Why not? - You can't do that.

295
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,259
He was just jumping on his own.

296
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,870
- You didn't tip him off? - No, I didn't. It was all him.

297
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,299
You should choose whomever you want.

298
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,710
- I'll choose 1 of these 2. - Okay, okay.

299
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,639
- I'll follow that rule, at least. - That's right.

300
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,710
(Jae Suk will choose his partner at last.)

301
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,740
I don't know whose photo this is.

302
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,080
(His final decision is the yellow door.)

303
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,649
I chose yellow. I chose the yellow door.

304
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,480
Is that her?

305
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,519
(Who is the girl at the waterpark?)

306
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,490
- It's Eun Jung. - It's Han Eun Jung.

307
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,490
- Hello. Hi. - It's Eun Jung.

308
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,860
- My goodness. - It's Eun Jung.

309
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,590
I heard what you said behind the door.

310
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,600
- Someone said I resembled Mi Wha. - It was him.

311
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,230
- Who said that? - It was Suk Jin.

312
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,700
- I heard everything. - Suk Jin said that.

313
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,230
To be honest, I almost came out.

314
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,639
- Please calm down. - Okay.

315
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,409
- Jong Kook, you're next. - Okay.

316
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,769
- Is it my turn? Okay. - Yes.

317
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,110
Gosh, he doesn't need to think at all.

318
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:50,250
Goodness, look at him.

319
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,380
Congratulations.

320
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,049
- It must be Jisoo. - Come on out.

321
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,750
Goodness, Jisoo.

322
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,889
- My gosh, Jisoo. - It's Jisoo.

323
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,220
- Hello. - Hi.

324
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
- It's Jisoo. - Let's go.

325
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,789
(Feeling sad)

326
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:03,990
Jennie told me that Jisoo wanted to team up with Jong Kook.

327
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,130
- Really? - I'm glad to hear that. Hold on.

328
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,929
We have Ji Hyo and So Min left now.

329
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,230
1, 2, 3.

330
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,470
Come on out.

331
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,769
It's Ji Hyo.

332
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,000
(Chi Yul is mine!)

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,070
There are only a few couples that are happy to be paired up.

334
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,279
(Suk Jin and Bora, Kwang Soo and Jennie, Jong Kook and Jisoo,)

335
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,779
(Jae Suk and Eun Jung, Se Chan and Ye Jin, Ji Hyo and Chi Yul,)

336
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,779
(and Haha and So Min)

337
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,750
So Min, the Frog.

338
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,220
- Ye Jin. - Gosh, today is...

339
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,019
We're going to have short interviews...

340
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,019
- with today's guests. - Short interviews?

341
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,289
- Eun Jung is joining us today. - Gosh, long time no see.

342
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,689
Here's the thing.

343
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,460
Eun Jung said that she wanted to star on Running Man before.

344
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,259
I could've joined...

345
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,929
- when it first started. - Really?

346
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,029
I was about to star on this show to promote my movie,

347
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,299
but I couldn't do that because the schedule didn't work out.

348
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,710
Strangely, I didn't get to star on this show before.

349
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,340
Then did you join us today just to experience this show?

350
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,779
- Yes, yes. - Are you sure?

351
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,380
From what I heard, you're appearing in an SBS drama.

352
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,019
- Eun Jung. - What's wrong with you?

353
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,950
You have to be honest on variety shows these days.

354
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,220
- You must be honest. - Let me explain.

355
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,250
That's not the reason.

356
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,049
I just happened to be in that drama.

357
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:07,090
Seriously.

358
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,689
Gosh, she's so thick-skinned.

359
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:09,960
- So... - Tell us the truth.

360
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,389
- My agent clearly told me this. - What did he say?

361
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,230
"Eun Jung, you're not here to promote the drama."

362
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,399
"I just want you..."

363
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,169
Aren't you in the new weekend drama, "Let Me Introduce Her"?

364
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,269
Yes, that's the one.

365
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,500
That's the drama, but I'm not here to promote that.

366
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,210
- That's not why? - Not at all.

367
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,679
- We should... - But by the time this episode airs,

368
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:29,039
the drama would have started airing. It would be after it must've aired.

369
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,779
- You weren't supposed to promote. - Why do you keep bringing that up?

370
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,509
(You said you weren't here to promote the drama.)

371
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:33,580
- You mentioned it so many times. - You keep mentioning it.

372
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,450
- You already mentioned it a lot. - She's not promoting the drama.

373
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,950
- I'm not promoting the drama. - She's merely sharing the news.

374
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,689
All right. Next.

375
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,289
Goodness, these two singers are causing quite a stir.

376
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,659
It's Black Pink.

377
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,960
(Black Pink is the most sought-after girl group.)

378
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,730
What's your ranking in the Billboard Chart?

379
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,070
Goodness, we helped you succeed. I'm serious.

380
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,130
(Black Pink was on Running Man in December, 2016.)

381
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,269
My gosh.

382
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:56,610
- We have to see "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du". - We ought to.

383
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,439
(They want to see "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" that swept the charts.)

384
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,779
The song heated up the US.

385
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,939
- I love this song. I really do. - My goodness.

386
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:04,880
- The song is playing now. - Here it is.

387
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,120
(Black Pink)

388
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,820
(The whole world is hooked on "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" for a month now.)

389
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:12,689
(This middle-aged fan's heart pounds.)

390
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,189
Here it comes.

391
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:16,460
- Let's go. - Hit you, hit you, hit you

392
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,090
- 1, 2. - Hit you with that

393
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:25,230
(Jennie's bullet hits this guy right in his heart.)

394
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,970
(Their thousands of charms are turning everyone into their fans.)

395
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,669
(What's up with his face? He's firing the gun with his face.)

396
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,309
(Let me do that too.)

397
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,710
Let's give it up for them!

398
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,009
(Black Pink has united everyone at the shoot.)

399
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,120
(Gosh, this is why I'm their fan.)

400
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,519
- Goodness. - Good work. Well done.

401
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,549
- How have you two been? - I'm curious too.

402
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,620
We were on a break for a year.

403
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,759
You were on a break?

404
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,130
- When did you take a break? - You didn't do anything?

405
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,730
- I thought you were busy. - Weren't you performing abroad?

406
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,559
- We had a one-year hiatus. - Yes, we were on a hiatus.

407
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,529
- Really? - We returned after a year.

408
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,429
- Really? Usually... - Why did you take a year off?

409
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,070
- Did you just rest, Jennie? - You did nothing?

410
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,840
- Yes, we were preparing the album. - Really?

411
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,470
- We just took a year off. - You didn't perform at all?

412
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:06,210
Since you're on a show, say something to Mr. Yang.

413
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,710
- A video message? - You two should stand together.

414
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,179
- Stand together. - A video message?

415
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,509
- Say that the hiatus wasn't fair. - That's right.

416
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,880
- Tell that to your CEO. - That's not right.

417
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Which camera do I look at?

418
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,519
(To Mr. Yang)

419
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,590
- Start. - Start.

420
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,720
Hello, Mr. Yang. It's Jisoo and Jennie.

421
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,659
- "Okay." - What was that?

422
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,689
(They're the cutest.)

423
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:25,830
(Shouldn't you make a complaint?)

424
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,929
- What was that? - "Okay."

425
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:30,000
- He must be really scary. - You have to sound firm.

426
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,399
- Jennie was ventriloquizing. - Try to sound firm.

427
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,299
- She was using ventriloquism. - Jennie.

428
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,899
- That was her way out later. - You should try to move your lips.

429
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:37,409
- She wasn't going to be part of it. - Please do that.

430
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,409
- She was going to pull out later. - You must tell him your opinions.

431
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,809
- Tell him. - Okay.

432
00:15:41,309 --> 00:15:42,710
- Go ahead. - Say something.

433
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,450
Mr. Yang.

434
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,720
Help us release two songs a year.

435
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,149
That's right. We ought to do that now.

436
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,490
- That was good. That was nice. - What was that all of a sudden?

437
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,889
- Is she trying to start a fight? - Yes, she's trying to fight him.

438
00:15:58,189 --> 00:15:59,330
You sounded firm. It was nice.

439
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:00,600
- Great. - You were firm. Great.

440
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,399
- I'm sure he watched it, right? - Twice a year. That's good.

441
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,929
- Yes. - They're cute.

442
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,269
- They'll comeback twice a year. - Right.

443
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,399
There are fans waiting.

444
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,169
- We want them to return too. - That's right.

445
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,669
- Do you want them to return? - Yes, I do.

446
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,980
- Tell that to Mr. Yang. - Pardon?

447
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,240
- You have the same last name. - You are a Yang too.

448
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,309
- You share the same last name. - Hi, my family is from Namwon.

449
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:21,019
I don't know where you're from, but this is from a Yang to another.

450
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,820
- Let them continue to be on TV. - That's right. Yes.

451
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,649
- Thank you. - That was nice.

452
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,360
(He uses his last name to petition for Black Pink's yearly comebacks.)

453
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,759
- That's great. - I'm a Yang too.

454
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,929
You can see...

455
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:31,759
- the next guest in a drama now. - She's really popular.

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,830
- Pyo Ye Jin. - It's Pyo Ye Jin.

457
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,370
Before she became an actress,

458
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,200
- she used to be a flight attendant. - That's right. Yes.

459
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,570
- Really? - Yes.

460
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,110
- You became an actress after that? - Yes.

461
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,439
- She seems to smile a lot. - She's likable.

462
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,110
Kwang Soo has a long face.

463
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,250
- He always... - I do?

464
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,679
- Long face? I'm always smiling. - Be quiet.

465
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,149
- I'm always smiling. - Stay out of it.

466
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:57,649
- I was smiling. What do you mean? - He looks like he's about to cry.

467
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,789
How should I describe his face? He's always nervous like this.

468
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:01,860
Horrible face.

469
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,689
(Horrible face)

470
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,090
- That qualifies as a horrible face? - Come on.

471
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,499
- Hey. - That was good.

472
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,830
Stop it.

473
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,270
Black Pink's watching.

474
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:12,429
And Haha.

475
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,070
Kwang Soo doesn't put on expressions like that anymore.

476
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,270
- Why not? Yes, he does. - Why not?

477
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,669
- He's changing his image. - It sold three million tickets.

478
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,939
In his movies and dramas,

479
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:21,340
he's pushing forward to become the male lead.

480
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,979
- He was the lead actor in "Live". - He was the lead actor a while ago.

481
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:27,380
Staring now, he'll try to beat Joong Ki now.

482
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:28,820
- Why would you say that? - What?

483
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,020
- Why would I beat Joong Ki? - It was just an example.

484
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,459
- Do this pose. Do the pose. - Yes, do it.

485
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:34,620
- Do it. - Yeom Sang Soo.

486
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,959
- Do the pose from the drama. - Do the Yeom Sang Soo pose.

487
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,290
- Do it. - How?

488
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,489
That's it.

489
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,959
- Great, great. - Take a screenshot of this.

490
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,699
"Freeze, Joong Ki."

491
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:43,199
(An exclusive interview with Kwang Soo)

492
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,699
- What do you mean? - "I'll catch him."

493
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:47,899
Well done. We got the scoop.

494
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,040
Why would I try to catch him?

495
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,510
- We got it. We got the exclusive. - I have nothing to do with him.

496
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,510
"Joong Ki can't beat me." That was great.

497
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,880
- What are you talking about? - "Joong Ki can't beat me."

498
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,010
- I'm saying that you have it wrong. - Great. Great.

499
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,010
- "Joong Ki, you can't beat me." - That's not right.

500
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,820
- That's not what I meant. - They'll print a lot of articles.

501
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,580
Why did you bring Joong Ki into this?

502
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,820
All right. I'll explain the rules.

503
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:08,459
Today's race is a couple race called Catch My Heart.

504
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,429
Among 14 briefcases, you will each choose 1.

505
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:16,770
2 bomb cards and 2 heart cards are randomly put into these briefcases.

506
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,270
The rest of the briefcases have empty cards.

507
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:25,169
After every round, winning couples can switch their briefcases.

508
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,409
After the final mission, the couple with both of the bomb cards...

509
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:32,080
will face a penalty.

510
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,120
- There's a penalty today. - We won't be last. We won't be.

511
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,149
In the order of acquiring the heart cards,

512
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,459
the presents will be awarded respectively.

513
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:42,659
Which present do you want?

514
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:45,659
The couple rings. Red ginseng? The red ginseng set.

515
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,300
Each couple will come forward and choose a briefcase.

516
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,330
Let's all choose one.

517
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,669
- Haha... - Thank you.

518
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:53,469
- and So Min will go first. - Thank you.

519
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,340
Yes, that was a great choice.

520
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,469
- Next up are... - Okay.

521
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,570
- Kwang Soo and Jennie. - Jennie.

522
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,340
(She strides toward one without any hesitation.)

523
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,010
Jennie, pick one more. Kwang Soo has the worst luck.

524
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,219
That's right. Let me choose it for you.

525
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:08,280
Jennie was shooing him away.

526
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,219
(Go away.)

527
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,320
Kwang Soo, she wanted you to back off.

528
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,090
- Okay. - Here.

529
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:16,489
I bet Disney will make...

530
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,929
- a film about them. - "Beauty and the Fish".

531
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,199
What? "Beauty and the Fish"?

532
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,699
- How does that relate to this? - Fish.

533
00:19:24,699 --> 00:19:26,370
He doesn't have to wear a mask.

534
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,999
- He already looks like a fish. - Right?

535
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:30,110
What did you say?

536
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,770
(Don't say that in front of Jennie.)

537
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,080
(They pick a total of 14 briefcase.)

538
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,540
- Does everyone have a briefcase? - Yes.

539
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,179
Spread out...

540
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:39,479
and check the inside of your briefcase with the cameramen.

541
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,780
We have to go to the corner and check.

542
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,479
It's by couples.

543
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,189
- I don't even hope for a heart. - I bet mine is empty.

544
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,360
I just don't want bombs.

545
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,659
Most of them are empty.

546
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:49,659
(He checks his briefcase.)

547
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,590
(Jae Suk finds a heart.)

548
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,260
(That's amazing.)

549
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,429
Jong Kook saw us.

550
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,469
Jong Kook saw us.

551
00:19:59,939 --> 00:20:01,499
What's this? What is it, Jong Kook?

552
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,270
I saw them. I did.

553
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,439
(Jong Kook saw Eun Jung's reaction.)

554
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,239
- Jong Kook saw us. - Goodness.

555
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,149
How do we know that we have a heart?

556
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:12,449
Take a look inside and control your facial expression.

557
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,449
They're watching us.

558
00:20:15,449 --> 00:20:16,949
(It's Kwang Soo's briefcase that Jennie picked.)

559
00:20:19,449 --> 00:20:22,389
(They find a bomb inside.)

560
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:26,560
My goodness.

561
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,899
I picked another briefcase,

562
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:29,600
but you handed me this one.

563
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,270
You'll have a chance to exchange it.

564
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,939
Isn't it advantageous to have it in the beginning?

565
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,209
- No? - What do you mean?

566
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,310
You may have a chance to change the briefcase.

567
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,510
(Where's the other heart and bomb?)

568
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,550
(What do the others have?)

569
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,050
(Kwang Soo has a bomb, and Jae Suk has a heart.)

570
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,719
It's the first mission where you may exchange your briefcase.

571
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:50,219
- It's That Talent is Mine. - Okay.

572
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,219
- "That Talent is Mine" - Talent.

573
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,860
Do we select and steal it?

574
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,729
Select 2 out of 7 talents written by female partners.

575
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,860
If you win the competition of your talent...

576
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,959
or beat the competition of someone else's talent,

577
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:04,929
you may exchange the briefcase with a member of your choice.

578
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:07,800
(The winning couple may exchange one of their briefcases.)

579
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:10,439
This is difficult.

580
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,810
Ye Jin, pick a talent.

581
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,880
Okay.

582
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,439
(Ye Jin selects the first category.)

583
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,649
(The winner is determined by the talent category.)

584
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,409
(What's the first category that Ye Jin picks?)

585
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:20,749
- What is it? - Is it dancing?

586
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:21,949
"Matching Dance"?

587
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,389
(It's Matching Dance.)

588
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:24,749
Jennie wrote it.

589
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:26,050
Jennie?

590
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,860
(Matching Dance is my talent.)

591
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,860
(Jennie's Matching Dance)

592
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,330
I can't win.

593
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,330
- Goodness. - What's Matching Dance?

594
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,770
It's dancing to match the music.

595
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,899
No matter what kind of music plays,

596
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,199
your dancing must match the concept given.

597
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,070
There are a total of six concepts.

598
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,840
Cute, sexy, bizarre, dreamy, powerful, and innocent.

599
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
There are six concepts.

600
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,649
There's bizarre.

601
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,110
We'll score points when it's the concept, "bizarre".

602
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,749
Do the leg dance.

603
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,149
- This is Jennie's talent. - You can do it, Jennie.

604
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,949
- Let's start with Jennie. - Okay.

605
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,760
- Okay. - She dances very well.

606
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,790
She's good.

607
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,689
- It's "Havana". - This is the song.

608
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:05,830
- "Havana". - This is the song.

609
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,860
- It's "Havana". - This is the song.

610
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,399
- "Havana". - This is the song.

611
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:11,469
(She moves lightly to the music.)

612
00:22:11,469 --> 00:22:13,469
(She dances with confidence.)

613
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:15,439
Gosh, it's "Havana".

614
00:22:15,739 --> 00:22:17,540
- She's good even from the start. - She is.

615
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:18,939
She dances well.

616
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,010
(Her shoulders and pelvis move freely.)

617
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,149
Look at her shoulders.

618
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:26,179
(Moving lightly)

619
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,219
Look at her shoulders. They're amazing.

620
00:22:28,949 --> 00:22:30,290
Her shoulders.

621
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,649
(Her dancing is aggressive.)

622
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:35,020
- I'll select a mood. - Here he goes.

623
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,219
Let's go.

624
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,489
(Pick one that Jennie is good at.)

625
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,760
Please pick one.

626
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,999
- Power. - It's power. Make it powerful.

627
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,899
(The mood is powerful.)

628
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,370
(She dances very powerfully.)

629
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:47,139
Make it powerful.

630
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,100
(She stomps the ground.)

631
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,939
- Power. - It's powerful.

632
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,939
(Did you see my partner?)

633
00:22:55,139 --> 00:22:57,749
- She should dance more. - You must dance more, Jennie.

634
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,050
- Make it more powerful. - It has to be powerful.

635
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:01,780
Stop.

636
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,020
- You can't win at this rate. - It won't work.

637
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,520
No, go back in.

638
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,020
It's Ye Jin's turn.

639
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,830
Jennie was disappointing even though she's an amazing dancer.

640
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,889
- It's difficult. - She's never done it before.

641
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:15,100
- Jennie isn't good at this game. - I'm not.

642
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,499
Which team wants to go first?

643
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:19,169
(So Min will go.)

644
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:21,270
- Goodness. - Do it.

645
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:23,639
What have you done today?

646
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,540
- Hey. - Bring me some Korean beef, okay?

647
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,380
Bring it.

648
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,780
(They only care about the prizes.)

649
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,149
He told me to bring the Korean beef set.

650
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,479
Haha told me to bring the Korean beef set.

651
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,020
"Bring the Korean beef set"?

652
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,090
(Please win the Korean beef set.)

653
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,419
Do you know what Eun Jung said?

654
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,830
After seeing Haha and So Min,

655
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,760
she said, "they aren't close, are they?"

656
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,600
(Haha and So Min only care about the business.)

657
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,840
(Even a guest member senses they focus only on business.)

658
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,239
She said that they don't seem close.

659
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:56,939
They don't seem close.

660
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:57,939
(Be friendly to each other.)

661
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,639
- I'm not confident. - So Min caught a cold.

662
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,310
- I caught a cold. - She took a lot of cold medicine.

663
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,380
I have a cold.

664
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,080
The effects of the medicine will make her dance.

665
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,880
She'll be perfect for a dreamy dance.

666
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:10,120
- Here's So Min. - Let's go.

667
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:14,820
- Gosh. - So Min.

668
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,189
Please start.

669
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:17,189
(She starts to move.)

670
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,489
- This is good. - What is she doing?

671
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:21,260
So Min is good at dancing.

672
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,929
- This is good. - Move your arms too.

673
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,800
(She warms up with a traditional techno move.)

674
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,040
- So Min. - Sexy.

675
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,070
- Sexy. - So Min.

676
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,270
(The mood is sexy.)

677
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,909
It's sexy. The mood is sexy.

678
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:33,979
(Is it sexy?)

679
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:35,439
(She takes off her cap.)

680
00:24:35,439 --> 00:24:36,649
This is good.

681
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,050
(She appeals to the audience with her hair.)

682
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,280
That's sexy.

683
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,120
- What's that? - What are you doing?

684
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,520
That looks very terrible.

685
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,159
- What's that? - That's not sexy.

686
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,590
It's not sexy at all.

687
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,489
- It looks terrible. - Thank you.

688
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,030
- That's good. - What's next?

689
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,229
- That's good. - Power.

690
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:54,999
(Next mood is power.)

691
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,229
Here's So Min's powerful dance.

692
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,800
(Shaking)

693
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,139
(She moves powerfully like a dryer.)

694
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,739
What kind of dance is that?

695
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,510
(She shakes her bottom powerfully.)

696
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,610
That's awesome.

697
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,639
(Haha is content.)

698
00:25:07,979 --> 00:25:10,050
(I'm embarrassed for her.)

699
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:11,580
She's a good dancer.

700
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,979
(It's an old powerful dance from the 90s.)

701
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,550
What's next? It's the last.

702
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,790
That's good.

703
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,120
(I'll take the Korean beef set.)

704
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,320
How about bizarre?

705
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,489
What's next? That was great.

706
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:25,229
- Bizarre. - Bizarre.

707
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:26,630
(The mood is bizarre.)

708
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,830
- It's bizarre. - It's bizarre, So Min.

709
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,070
- It's bizarre, So Min. - It's bizarre.

710
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,300
The mood is bizarre.

711
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,439
(Is this how to do it?)

712
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,880
(I'll bring something to help you.)

713
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,709
(He brings out a spoon.)

714
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,850
(Where did you get it?)

715
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,320
It's been a long time.

716
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,020
(Come out, Magnet Human.)

717
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,919
- It's a magnet. - Stick to it.

718
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,090
So Min, act like Magnet Human.

719
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,060
(Welcome back, Magnet Human.)

720
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,959
(Look, she's back.)

721
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,659
(You've waited a long time.)

722
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:04,370
Show us.

723
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,669
You should approve of her.

724
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:08,070
(Everyone bursts out laughing at Magnet Human.)

725
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,709
That's good enough.

726
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:12,570
Go back in. You did well.

727
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,610
That's hilarious.

728
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,610
(Come back in.)

729
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:17,149
- Hey. - That's enough.

730
00:26:17,149 --> 00:26:21,380
(I'm still hungry. I'm not done yet.)

731
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:26,760
(Her bizarre dance is a success when she attaches the spoon.)

732
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:29,459
- You're the best. - That's great.

733
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,290
It was definitely bizarre.

734
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,929
- It's been a long time. - It's been a while.

735
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,429
- That was cool. - Magnet Human.

736
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,969
- Jennie. - Yes?

737
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,330
Did you see her?

738
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:40,800
- I approve of her talent. - Jennie.

739
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,300
- So Min... - It's very competitive.

740
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,840
- can't dance well as Jennie. - Jennie.

741
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,780
She went against Girls' Generation alone.

742
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,310
(She has a winning record.)

743
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,409
- It's true. - It's really true.

744
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,749
- As you can see, - It's true.

745
00:26:51,749 --> 00:26:53,649
So Min is a street dancer.

746
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,550
She just dances.

747
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,749
No one can defeat her bizarre dance.

748
00:26:57,749 --> 00:26:59,550
- Who's next? - It's Chi Yeul.

749
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,159
- It's Chi Yeul. - Will Chi Yeul dance?

750
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:02,320
Here's Hwang Chi Yeul.

751
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,790
- It's Chi Yeul. - Chi Yeul.

752
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,030
G-Dragon from Gumi.

753
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,130
- We'll see him b-boying. - It's G-Dragon from Gumi.

754
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,630
His dancing is amazing.

755
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,330
I haven't done bizarre dances.

756
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,669
I thought...

757
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:14,600
Chi Yeul was on "Happy Together" today.

758
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,770
(What's wrong with his outfit?)

759
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,939
- I have a water gun. - He's in a sauna outfit.

760
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,939
- Happy Together. - Together.

761
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,010
(They advertise another show.)

762
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,810
(At that time,)

763
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,580
(music starts.)

764
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,919
(Oh, I know this song.)

765
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,159
(He dances to the rhythm.)

766
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,030
(It's a nice shot.)

767
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,929
(How far will my charms go?)

768
00:27:39,189 --> 00:27:40,699
(He dances so well.)

769
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:43,830
He dances very well.

770
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,270
(He warms up his body with an amazing movement.)

771
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,439
Innocent.

772
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:51,810
(He does a side moonwalk.)

773
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,409
Chi Yeul, it's innocent.

774
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:55,139
Innocent.

775
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,080
Innocent.

776
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,949
(They scream at Chi Yeul's innocent dance.)

777
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:04,350
(Winking is perfect for innocence.)

778
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
You're doing well.

779
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:07,719
He's moving backwards.

780
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,090
- It looks more powerful. - What is he doing?

781
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,760
- His dancing is more powerful. - Right?

782
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,199
Isn't it cute?

783
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:15,459
What's next?

784
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,830
- Bizarre. - Bizarre.

785
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,070
(The mood is bizarre.)

786
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,530
(Moving about)

787
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:21,199
What is he doing?

788
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,639
(Why is he taking off his shirt?)

789
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:23,639
Goodness.

790
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:25,540
(He moves about.)

791
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,639
What's that?

792
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,709
(It's a bizarre dance where his arm shoots out.)

793
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,850
(My partner does a good bizarre dance.)

794
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,050
What's that?

795
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,649
(That's amazing.)

796
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:35,820
- What's next? - Powerful.

797
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,149
(The mood is powerful.)

798
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,389
- It's powerful. - Here it comes.

799
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:41,189
(G-Dragon of Gumi starts.)

800
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,459
(His power is explosive.)

801
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:48,630
(He dances perfectly to the concept just like G-Dragon of Gumi.)

802
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,929
(Shall I lie down?)

803
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,729
(He goes back up.)

804
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,669
(Is there something above?)

805
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:57,409
(Chi Yeul also known as G-Dragon of Gumi)

806
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,639
(I'm G-Dragon of Mapo.)

807
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,340
- Hey, kid. - Haha.

808
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,580
Go back in.

809
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,749
Go back in, kid.

810
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:06,419
- Haha. - Go back in, kid.

811
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,419
You're making it dusty.

812
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,889
You're the best in my eyes.

813
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:13,719
I knew that Chi Yeul was good at dancing.

814
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,030
- He was excellent. - That was amazing.

815
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,429
He dances really well.

816
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:19,699
I've never seen such a powerful dance.

817
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:21,600
His arm shot up.

818
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,330
I didn't turn that much.

819
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,830
(He speaks with an accent.)

820
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,300
(Unlike his fancy dance, he speaks like an old man.)

821
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,939
I want to see him spin.

822
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,639
- What? - I want to see him spin.

823
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:32,909
- Next up is... - Bora.

824
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,139
- No. Let's see Eun Jung first. - Okay.

825
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,780
- No. Let's see Eun Jung first. - Why?

826
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,050
(Cold)

827
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,850
- Bora has been getting ready. - It's okay.

828
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:43,449
Eun Jung, please come forward. Come on.

829
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,419
- She might be a good dancer. - You never know.

830
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,260
She appeared in one of SG Wannabe's music videos.

831
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,389
She danced.

832
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:51,659
- When was that? - It was a long time ago.

833
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,729
I watched it over a thousand times in the army.

834
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,399
She's a great dancer.

835
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,130
- I can't do this. - Give us some music.

836
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,040
I'm here to promote my drama.

837
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,439
(Confession)

838
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:04,239
(As soon as the music plays, she starts dancing.)

839
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:06,639
- Here we go. - I knew it. I love it.

840
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,979
She is warming up.

841
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:11,149
She is a bit hesitant.

842
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:14,050
I can see that she's never taken any dance classes.

843
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,389
- No basic skills. - It's club dance.

844
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,419
Let's go. It's been great so far.

845
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,130
Here we go. Eun Jung.

846
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,830
- "Cute". - "Cute".

847
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:27,830
(Cute?)

848
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:31,229
(That's very cute.)

849
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,139
That's cute.

850
00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:34,340
(It's a bit too cute.)

851
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,169
Don't get her wrong. She's not promoting her drama.

852
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:39,270
(Please watch my drama.)

853
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,010
Let's move on.

854
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,110
- Next. - Next.

855
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:46,209
Next.

856
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,520
- "Powerful". - "Powerful".

857
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,919
- Powerful? - Yes.

858
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,520
- Why are you taking your shirt off? - What are you doing?

859
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
(She gets stopped.)

860
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,760
What are you doing?

861
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,530
Why... What are you doing?

862
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,830
(Her unexpected behavior leaves the audience in shock.)

863
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,770
- Hold on. - What are you doing?

864
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,999
How is this powerful dance?

865
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,370
(Powerful)

866
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,340
- What is this? - What are you doing?

867
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,639
- What's that? - What's with her?

868
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,310
- What's with her? - Stop her.

869
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:21,219
Pick something else.

870
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,020
(Don't pick the next one yet.)

871
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,919
Eun Jung.

872
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,820
- "Sexy". - "Sexy".

873
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,989
(They hurriedly pick the next one to stop her powerful dance.)

874
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:30,630
Eun Jung is so funny.

875
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:32,429
(What?)

876
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:35,199
- What's that? - What's that?

877
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:37,100
(If you want sexy dance,)

878
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,499
(here it is.)

879
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:42,199
(It gets worse.)

880
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,510
(Please stop right now.)

881
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,380
(She throws her t-shirt.)

882
00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,780
- Why did you throw it? - This isn't a club.

883
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,380
Why did you throw your shirt?

884
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,320
Eun Jung, you can stop now.

885
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,590
- She said she didn't want to dance. - Please stop.

886
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,189
Someone drag her out!

887
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:01,090
- You didn't want to dance. - Please stop the music!

888
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,929
- She knows no shame. - What?

889
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,159
- What was that? - When she threw her shirt,

890
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,899
the cameraman got hit by it, and...

891
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:11,999
(The cameraman hated it.)

892
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,739
(She starts to feel embarrassed.)

893
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:17,570
- It was amazing. - You're a great dancer.

894
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,380
It was very unrefined.

895
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,280
- It was the ultimate raw dance. - Right.

896
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,850
- It was old-fashioned. - She's clearly never taken classes.

897
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,550
- Respect. - Respect!

898
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:29,350
Big respect.

899
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,590
- Next up is... - Bora.

900
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:34,189
- She's the real one. - Our final contestant.

901
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,989
- I feel pressured. - She's an amazing dancer.

902
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:38,530
- Yes. - Bora is...

903
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,999
- a fantastic dancer. - She's incredible.

904
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,100
What is this?

905
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,100
(To this song,)

906
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,300
(you should dance like this.)

907
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,370
(Her waves are so sophisticated.)

908
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,840
- That's a recent dance. - She's amazing.

909
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,739
- She's really good. - She is.

910
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,249
- She is an amazing dancer. - I can't believe it.

911
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,949
You're beautiful.

912
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,949
(It's so sophisticated.)

913
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,689
(My partner is amazing.)

914
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,090
She's a really good dancer.

915
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:09,620
(Her sophisticated dance is completed by leg-shaking moves.)

916
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,459
(Feminine)

917
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,800
"Feminine".

918
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,929
(Like this?)

919
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,300
(She completes her task 200 percent.)

920
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,370
- I'll admit it, she's really good. - Seriously.

921
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,840
- She's amazing. - She changed her style right away.

922
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,209
She's really good. Doesn't she deserve to win?

923
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,739
- She's amazing. - She's fantastic.

924
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,479
She's really good.

925
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,550
She's so expressive.

926
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,780
- "Dreamy". - "Dreamy".

927
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,149
"Dreamy".

928
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:36,850
That sounds hard.

929
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,550
(Let me be dreamy and sexy.)

930
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,520
- It's incredible. - It's amazing.

931
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,130
(She looks like she'll fall asleep.)

932
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,389
She even closed her eyes.

933
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:49,429
- She's really good. - She's fantastic.

934
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,169
- Lastly... - "Powerful".

935
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,499
(Powerful)

936
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:58,739
(She conquers the stage with a completely different style.)

937
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:00,540
She's amazing.

938
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,249
(That's a whole difference class.)

939
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,510
I can't believe it.

940
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,149
(Have you've liked it so far?)

941
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:08,579
- This is amazing. - I can't believe it.

942
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:11,149
(I'm not done yet.)

943
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,090
(She completes her powerful dance with a popular move.)

944
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,260
Her sense of rhythm is impeccable.

945
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,490
Give her a big hand.

946
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,530
- She's an amazing dancer. - It was fantastic.

947
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,869
I don't know what I just did.

948
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,300
- She's a fantastic dancer. - Everyone is shocked.

949
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,570
Bora was amazing especially after we saw Eun Jung.

950
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,369
It was completely different. It was fantastic.

951
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,840
Wasn't it amazing?

952
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:38,110
(After Eun Jung, Bora's dance looks even more amazing.)

953
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,280
(Elite dancer versus unrefined dancer)

954
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,149
- But... - She's the best dancer.

955
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:43,490
this talent was chosen by Jennie.

956
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,149
- It's hard. - It is.

957
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:48,019
But Bora deserves to win.

958
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,019
We admit it.

959
00:34:49,019 --> 00:34:50,289
Bora wins!

960
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,430
(Bora and Suk Jin get to switch their briefcase with another.)

961
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,999
- This will be the last talent. - Okay.

962
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,930
So Min, please pick one.

963
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,769
Me? Okay.

964
00:35:00,939 --> 00:35:02,640
- "Cute acrostic poem". - "Cute acrostic poem".

965
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,939
- "Cute acrostic poem". - Whose talent is it?

966
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,280
- Okay. - Ye Jin?

967
00:35:08,479 --> 00:35:11,910
("Cute acrostic poem" is Ye Jin's talent.)

968
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,550
Ye Jin, please start.

969
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:17,749
You could use Se Chan's name or your name.

970
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:20,320
Recently, Twice tried it on Running Man,

971
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,229
and it became a hit.

972
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:28,760
(Twice's Na Yeon's cute acrostic poem became a sensation.)

973
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,769
(I want to eat it with Jong Kook.)

974
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:34,039
(Kookookaka)

975
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,269
(Kookookaka)

976
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:39,410
(Her cute poem left the whole Gapyeong County in shock.)

977
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,240
Our standards have become higher.

978
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,479
A lot.

979
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:45,749
- It's all over the Internet now. - Right.

980
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:48,249
Ye Jin, which word do you want to use?

981
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,649
- I'll try with my name. - Okay.

982
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,820
(Okay)

983
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,329
Se Chan was looking forward to it.

984
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:59,130
I was looking forward to it so much, I almost stepped forward.

985
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:01,329
I can see that this is an individual game.

986
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,630
Ye Jin, I understand you.

987
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,640
Like I said before, Ye Jin is on her own today.

988
00:36:06,669 --> 00:36:09,039
- She's on her own. Okay. - It happens to you all the time.

989
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,140
"Se Chan and I are..."

990
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,840
"just wearing the same color."

991
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,479
- Yes. It's a coincidence. - It's a coincidence.

992
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:17,680
All right. "Yang Se Chan".

993
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,550
She wants to go with "Pyo Ye Jin".

994
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,220
But she'll do it while looking at me.

995
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,390
- Isn't it interesting? - That's unusual.

996
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,490
- While looking at me. "Pyo". - Okay.

997
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,059
Let's try.

998
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,990
- Should we go to the center? - Okay.

999
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,130
- The normal way is boring. - Yes. Go with "Pyo Ye Jin".

1000
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,999
This is an unusual experience.

1001
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,630
- I've never experienced it before. - She's using her own name.

1002
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,130
We'll pay attention.

1003
00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:38,999
"Pyo".

1004
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,800
- What's with your face? - Okay.

1005
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,039
I knew you were in a bad mood.

1006
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,740
- Is this a cute acrostic poem? - Is this a cute acrostic poem?

1007
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,050
- It's supposed to be cute. - It's supposed to be cute.

1008
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,649
- Let's hear the whole thing. - "What's with your face?"

1009
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:53,749
"Ye".

1010
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,490
- Do I look pretty today? - Of course.

1011
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,090
(Of course.)

1012
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,760
Why do you look away? Keep looking at her.

1013
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,399
- He's shy. He likes it. - Lastly, "Jin".

1014
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:08,760
Lastly, "Jin".

1015
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,369
Gosh, I don't know.

1016
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,539
- What? - Please go back.

1017
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,369
(Hitting)

1018
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,570
- Please go back. - Hold on.

1019
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,439
- I really don't know. - Hey.

1020
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,280
- You don't know what? - I don't know either.

1021
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,280
You don't know what? What do you mean?

1022
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,320
- Hold on. - Like I said before,

1023
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,149
stay in your spot.

1024
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,390
- If we had known... - Stay in your spot.

1025
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,890
- I thought it'd be better. - She made us expect more.

1026
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,260
If it's nothing special, stay in your spot.

1027
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,329
We're supposed to show off our talents,

1028
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:40,700
but the owners of the talents have been awful so far.

1029
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,470
- It's awful. - Jennie tried her best.

1030
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,470
Everyone has been disappointing.

1031
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:48,539
If no one wants to try, she'll win.

1032
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:49,539
- Really? - We'll win?

1033
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,039
- Ye Jin will win? - That's not okay.

1034
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,939
This is not okay!

1035
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:54,640
- If no one wants to try. - It's absurd.

1036
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,910
- Jennie wants to try. - Good.

1037
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,849
Jennie is cute the way she is.

1038
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:02,280
Do you want to use someone's name?

1039
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,149
You can use "seagull", for example.

1040
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,019
- Hold on. - Hold on.

1041
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:07,660
Why "seagull"?

1042
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,519
Usually, it's the partner's name. Why did you say "seagull"?

1043
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,990
Kwang Soo was looking forward.

1044
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,660
- "Seagull"? - "Seagull"?

1045
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,930
She could use "fish" too.

1046
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,769
- "Seagull"? - What's wrong with it?

1047
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,369
- Kwang Soo was looking forward. - Which word do you want to use?

1048
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,369
I'll try "Lee Kwang Soo".

1049
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,539
(Jennie is the best.)

1050
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,410
- Kwang Soo is dreaming again. - This is unfair.

1051
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,110
- Wake up! - This will...

1052
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,749
- linger for a while. - Exactly.

1053
00:38:30,749 --> 00:38:33,050
- Kwang Soo will... - He'll get the wrong idea.

1054
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,950
It'll give Kwang Soo the wrong idea.

1055
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,490
Jennie will try "Lee Kwang Soo".

1056
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,789
"Lee".

1057
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,860
I think it's time for President Yang Hyun Suk to give me permission.

1058
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,499
- What is this? - Is this a public announcement?

1059
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:48,700
No. Not yet.

1060
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,030
- On TV? - "Kwang".

1061
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,899
Kwang Soo, do you want to...

1062
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,470
What's going on?

1063
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,209
"Soo".

1064
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,439
Have a drink with me?

1065
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,419
(Do you want to have a drink with me?)

1066
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:09,019
(I love it.)

1067
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,249
(Kneeling down)

1068
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,249
You're just going to pay for drinks.

1069
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,919
- Hey. - Do you know that?

1070
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:17,760
(You're going just to pay for the drinks. Nothing else.)

1071
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,260
- Just give her your credit card. - When they're done...

1072
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,729
We're not drinking together?

1073
00:39:21,729 --> 00:39:23,229
- Just give her your credit card. - You're just her wallet.

1074
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:24,570
- We're not drinking together? - You're her wallet.

1075
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,340
- "Will you pay for my drink?" - Just my credit card?

1076
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,640
If you buy all of them drinks it will cost 2,000 dollars.

1077
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,099
That was good.

1078
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:30,570
- It made my heart flutter. - That was good.

1079
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,740
Listen.

1080
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,309
More than anything,

1081
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:36,209
the content was referred to Kwang Soo.

1082
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,309
I'm in.

1083
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,309
(I'm in.)

1084
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,050
- I'd love to have a drink. - You don't have to answer.

1085
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,579
- Don't answer it. - I'd love to.

1086
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,019
- We could go out. - Don't answer.

1087
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,320
Listen, Kwang Soo.

1088
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,890
Hyun Suk will send someone for you.

1089
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,490
- Why? - All of a sudden.

1090
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,590
- We're co-workers. - Men in black suits...

1091
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,930
- will take Kwang Soo away. - We can drink as co-workers.

1092
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,499
Why would men in suits take me away?

1093
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,769
Why would they?

1094
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,130
- Kwang Soo. - For now,

1095
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,099
do it only if you want to try it.

1096
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,499
We're currently the winner.

1097
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,010
(If there's no competitor, they're like to win.)

1098
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:05,140
Otherwise, Jennie will win.

1099
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,240
Jennie is currently the winner.

1100
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,939
Who could do better than that?

1101
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,149
I'd like to start.

1102
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,450
- Eun Jung? - She finally plays.

1103
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,479
Tell her to keep quiet.

1104
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Here comes a powerful dancer.

1105
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:18,890
Here's Eun Jung.

1106
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,820
Tell her to take a break for a bit.

1107
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,030
I didn't think that Eun Jung would do it.

1108
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:24,289
Will you do it?

1109
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:26,189
You have to make it cute. Can you do it?

1110
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,530
- Yes, I can. - Eun Jung.

1111
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,700
Which name would you like?

1112
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,829
Kim Jong Kook.

1113
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:31,930
Kim Jong Kook.

1114
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,140
Me?

1115
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,300
(Not me?)

1116
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,269
(He laughs at him.)

1117
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:38,709
(That serves you right.)

1118
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,240
That's great.

1119
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,410
That's good.

1120
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,579
Okay.

1121
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,749
It serves him right.

1122
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,579
Jae Suk asked about which name she'll use.

1123
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:48,950
She said, "Kim Jong Kook".

1124
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,419
(Jae Suk backs away in disappointment.)

1125
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,059
- That's great. - Hey, you punk.

1126
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,820
You punk.

1127
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:57,329
(It serves you right.)

1128
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,289
- Okay. - All right.

1129
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,729
- Let's start with Kim. - Okay.

1130
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:02,760
"Kim".

1131
00:41:03,229 --> 00:41:04,530
(Kim)

1132
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,200
During my career on TV,

1133
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
I saw Jong Kook for the first time in 20 years.

1134
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,410
- For the first time? - Is it the first time?

1135
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,410
Is it the first time?

1136
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:12,869
I don't think so.

1137
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:14,180
- It's our first time. - Is it?

1138
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,680
- It's our first time. - It is.

1139
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,709
"Jong".

1140
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,649
I'll do it again.

1141
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,450
Is she filming a drama?

1142
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,419
- Did you hear that? - Is she filming a drama?

1143
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,149
She does whatever she wants.

1144
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,289
- She wants to start over. - Hey.

1145
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:28,559
- She can't do it again. - Be quiet.

1146
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,630
- She can't do it again. - That's not fair.

1147
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,530
Be quiet. I'm going to kick you.

1148
00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:34,599
It can't be interrupted.

1149
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,999
- Right. - Let's keep going.

1150
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:37,169
- There must be a flow. - Did you hear her?

1151
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:39,530
- Don't interrupt her. - Okay.

1152
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,700
Who interrupted you?

1153
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,340
I think she interrupted herself.

1154
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,410
(Who interrupted and said that she'll do it again?)

1155
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,380
- "I'll do it again." - I said, "Jong".

1156
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,410
She didn't keep going.

1157
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,309
- Let's do it again. - Please start again.

1158
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:50,809
"Kim".

1159
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,550
During my career on TV, I saw Jong Kook...

1160
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,419
for the first time in 20 years.

1161
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:56,919
- It's the same as last time. - But...

1162
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,320
- I said but. - I see.

1163
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,660
Don't interrupt her and keep going. "But"?

1164
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,660
"But"?

1165
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,689
"Jong".

1166
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,459
He's very amazing.

1167
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,689
"He's very amazing".

1168
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,130
- "Kook". - Wait.

1169
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:10,269
Wait, it's a cute acrostic poem, right?

1170
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:12,099
She told you not to interrupt.

1171
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,539
Don't interrupt her.

1172
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,399
- Don't do that, Kwang Soo. - That's not what I meant.

1173
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,769
- Leave. - This isn't a love poem.

1174
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,840
- She has to start over again. - I'm sorry.

1175
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,240
- Do you have to start over? - I'm sorry.

1176
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,209
I have to start over. It has to flow.

1177
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,110
Don't you dare interrupt her!

1178
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,220
I'm sorry.

1179
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,649
Stop interrupting. Don't say anything.

1180
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:31,050
Let her do it.

1181
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:32,649
- We'll do it again. - Pardon?

1182
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,789
We'll do it again.

1183
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,590
Here we go again.

1184
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,729
"Kim".

1185
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,030
During my career on TV...

1186
00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:41,030
You saw him.

1187
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:43,499
- It's our first time in 20 years. - Don't interrupt her.

1188
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:44,769
Kim Jong Kook...

1189
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,470
I saw Jong Kook for the first time in 20 years, but...

1190
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,010
"Jong".

1191
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:52,769
He's really amazing.

1192
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:54,309
"He's really amazing."

1193
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,380
"Kook".

1194
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:59,209
"His muscle that I want to press".

1195
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,919
"His muscle that I want to press".

1196
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:06,590
Was that your poem? Eun Jung.

1197
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,860
- "His muscle that I want to press"? - His muscle that you want to press?

1198
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:09,990
Go away.

1199
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,559
You just wanted to touch it.

1200
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,729
- Go away. - What's wrong with her?

1201
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,930
- You did a good job. - It's because...

1202
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,499
It's because the flow was interrupted.

1203
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,240
(It's difficult to be cute.)

1204
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,740
- Wasn't it okay? - It was good.

1205
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:27,010
- What's wrong, Kwang Soo? - What's going on?

1206
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,079
Se Chan said,

1207
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,349
"As Eun Jung pressed down his muscle,"

1208
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:32,809
"I thought she would kiss Jong Kook on his cheek."

1209
00:43:32,809 --> 00:43:33,979
That's what I said.

1210
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:35,649
- That's what he thought. - To be cute.

1211
00:43:35,649 --> 00:43:37,249
- Then Jennie said, - No way.

1212
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,149
"Oh, that would have been better."

1213
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,289
(That would have been better.)

1214
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,459
No.

1215
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:43,789
That's what Jennie said.

1216
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,490
She did a good job.

1217
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,160
She's free to think however she wants.

1218
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,999
It seemed like a good idea.

1219
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:52,130
Eun Jung tried hard.

1220
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,769
She did the best that she could.

1221
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,070
- It was a good poem. - Right.

1222
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,970
I don't want to be the first woman to get hit.

1223
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,680
- You wouldn't be the first. - She wouldn't?

1224
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:04,280
She wouldn't be the first?

1225
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,479
I warn you.

1226
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,849
So Min is at risk.

1227
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,280
- I was the first candidate. - Right.

1228
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,149
Who's next?

1229
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,260
- It's Bora. - All right, Bora.

1230
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,760
Bora can be quite cute.

1231
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,860
Which name will you use?

1232
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,160
I'll use Kim Jong Kook.

1233
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,630
What? Me?

1234
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,760
Why me all of a sudden?

1235
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,800
Why is he so popular?

1236
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:27,039
Let's go with Kim Jong Kook. "Kim".

1237
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:30,269
- Kim Jong Kook. - What?

1238
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:31,669
Do you...

1239
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,140
"Jong".

1240
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,209
Do you hear bells ringing?

1241
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:41,019
(Kim Jong Kook, do you hear bells ringing?)

1242
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:42,079
"Kook".

1243
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,450
Poke, here it is.

1244
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,419
(Poke, here it is.)

1245
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:47,559
(Here is what?)

1246
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,720
How dare she?

1247
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,930
(Do you know what it is?)

1248
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,959
- Hey! - Bora, Bora.

1249
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,899
These girls keep touching me!

1250
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,329
- Good job. - Hey.

1251
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,899
- How could she do that? - This isn't "Dining Together".

1252
00:44:57,899 --> 00:44:59,369
Why did you ring the bell?

1253
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,599
What are you doing?

1254
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,309
She hit the right spot.

1255
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,610
She poked it in one try.

1256
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,439
"Kook" is a good word.

1257
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:08,439
- Push hard. - Goodness.

1258
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,550
- Poke, poke - Stop it.

1259
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,010
(Stop it.)

1260
00:45:12,749 --> 00:45:13,780
Goodness.

1261
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,079
Poke, poke, poke

1262
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,220
(He keeps poking.)

1263
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,490
(I told you to stop.)

1264
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,220
(He pokes him back.)

1265
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,959
That's not it. It's right here.

1266
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,289
- No. - It's here.

1267
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:27,430
It's here for Jae Suk.

1268
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,899
(He points at his knees.)

1269
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:30,669
(How low are you going?)

1270
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:31,829
That brat.

1271
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:34,640
It's unclear who the winner is,

1272
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,099
but she has a chance.

1273
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,309
(Bora threatens Jennie.)

1274
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,910
You did a good job.

1275
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,410
No one can defeat them.

1276
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,880
- She's cute. - She was very cute.

1277
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,010
- All right. - I'll try.

1278
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,479
- Okay. - Which name do you choose?

1279
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,220
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

1280
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,919
- His name is best for cute poems. - He got so lucky.

1281
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:55,019
I wish my name were Lee Jong Kook.

1282
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,729
Jisoo...

1283
00:45:56,729 --> 00:46:00,559
already has a cute voice.

1284
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:02,030
Let's start. "Kim".

1285
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:06,539
Why are you playing with other women and make me angry?

1286
00:46:06,939 --> 00:46:08,740
"Why are you playing with other women"?

1287
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,439
- Why am I playing with others? - She's angry.

1288
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,510
"Jong".

1289
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,840
Jong Kook, you'll be mine.

1290
00:46:18,249 --> 00:46:19,380
No way.

1291
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,979
(She says that he'll be hers.)

1292
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:22,220
I'm in trouble.

1293
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,419
No way.

1294
00:46:23,419 --> 00:46:24,519
"Kook".

1295
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,820
Poke.

1296
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:30,130
- That was cute. - It was cute.

1297
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,459
- Good job. - It was cute.

1298
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,760
Her act was cute.

1299
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,430
Kook is great.

1300
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,729
Mother, thank you for giving me this name.

1301
00:46:36,729 --> 00:46:38,729
Kook should be the last word in acrostic poems.

1302
00:46:38,899 --> 00:46:40,240
I saw Jong Kook.

1303
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,269
He held his hands together, and when you said, "Kook",

1304
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,840
he tensed up his chest in case she touches it.

1305
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:45,910
Watch the recording.

1306
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,539
I definitely saw him.

1307
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,180
His chest got tense.

1308
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,950
(He gets ready for the poke.)

1309
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,849
(Tensing up)

1310
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:57,950
- He thought it'd be his chest. - Stop it.

1311
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,419
As a man, I understand.

1312
00:46:59,419 --> 00:47:00,919
(His chest muscle gets ready for Jisoo's fingers.)

1313
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,189
(You didn't have to do that.)

1314
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:04,289
For this round of acrostic poems,

1315
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,729
- we have a winner. - We do.

1316
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,499
- Jennie. - She's the winner.

1317
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:09,899
(Jennie wins.)

1318
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,930
That was amazing.

1319
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,899
- She did a great job. - She did.

1320
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,240
(She knows how to be cute.)

1321
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,640
We should accept the truth.

1322
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:21,110
The winning couples...

1323
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,510
get to exchange a briefcase with another couple.

1324
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,280
A few minutes ago...

1325
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,450
- I know with whom I want. - Who?

1326
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,079
May I exchange it?

1327
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:32,950
(With who will Bora exchange her briefcase?)

1328
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,720
Me?

1329
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,559
(Bora exchanges with Jae Suk, who has a heart.)

1330
00:47:38,229 --> 00:47:40,559
- We'll exchange with Jae Suk's. - Okay.

1331
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,999
(Bora gets a heart. What will Jae Suk get?)

1332
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,499
(It's time for Kwang Soo and Jennie to exchange.)

1333
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:46,669
It's our turn.

1334
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:47,669
We'll exchange...

1335
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,439
this bag with Jisoo's.

1336
00:47:50,439 --> 00:47:51,970
(We'll exchange the briefcase with Jisoo.)

1337
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:53,340
(Kwang Soo has a bomb in his.)

1338
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,510
It's because...

1339
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,010
I saw the look on her face when she opened it.

1340
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,519
She's been holding onto her bag.

1341
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,149
Check the inside with cameramen.

1342
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:03,220
Let's take a look.

1343
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,050
Suk Jin, don't make any face, okay?

1344
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:07,959
- Everyone is watching you. - Keep a straight face.

1345
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,390
I'll keep a poker face.

1346
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:12,430
Shall I show it to you?

1347
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,829
(She finds a heart in Jae Suk's bag.)

1348
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:19,840
- Are we done? - Keep a poker face.

1349
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,769
- Everyone is watching you. - They're watching me.

1350
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,269
(What did Bora give to Jae Suk?)

1351
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:27,840
(It's empty.)

1352
00:48:28,709 --> 00:48:31,680
(Our heart card was stolen.)

1353
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,649
(Kwang Soo gave away a bomb card.)

1354
00:48:34,649 --> 00:48:37,550
(He gets an empty card from Jisoo.)

1355
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,220
(At least we got rid of the bomb.)

1356
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,059
I knew it.

1357
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:46,760
(Will they get rid of it during the next mission?)

1358
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,130
I could tell by his expression.

1359
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:49,930
Okay.

1360
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,999
(Current card status)

1361
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,840
(Bora has the heart card, Jisoo has the bomb card.)

1362
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,840
(They enter a refreshing outdoor water park.)

1363
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,039
- Which will we ride? - The red one is really fun.

1364
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,149
Here's your second mission.

1365
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:06,079
It's a chance to exchange bags and win snacks.

1366
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,220
Snacks?

1367
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,689
- Chi Yul, let's eat snacks. - I'm hungry.

1368
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:13,360
- I'm hungry. - I'm hungry.

1369
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,019
- There are snacks. - I'm hungry.

1370
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,059
- Are you hungry? - I'm hungry.

1371
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:20,059
The mission with snacks on the line is Route of Your Choice.

1372
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:22,660
Two couples will make a team.

1373
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,269
You'll pick between Horror Room and Mirror Room.

1374
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:29,140
(You'll choose between Horror Room and Mirror Room.)

1375
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:30,970
Horror and Mirror?

1376
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,280
- Horror Room must be scary. - Mirror...

1377
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:36,410
When you go in, you'll see two rooms.

1378
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,479
(Horror Room, Mirror Room)

1379
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,849
(Horror Room will startle you,)

1380
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,849
(and Mirror Room is a maze of mirrors.)

1381
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,519
Each of you will hold...

1382
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,950
a glass full of water over your head.

1383
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,590
The team with more water left...

1384
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,930
at the end will win.

1385
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,200
The team that finishes last will lose half of their water.

1386
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,260
You have to be quick and keep as much water as you can.

1387
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,630
Wouldn't Mirror Room be better?

1388
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,970
It'd be better.

1389
00:50:00,169 --> 00:50:01,970
- We choose Horror Room. - Let's do it.

1390
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,169
- You'll startle the ghosts. - Let's be quick.

1391
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,039
There are seven couples,

1392
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,349
so one couple will compete...

1393
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,820
against a couple of staff members...

1394
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,820
who already know exactly how the rooms look.

1395
00:50:15,919 --> 00:50:17,519
That'd be hard.

1396
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,149
- That'd be bad. - That'd be bad.

1397
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,890
Let's decide which team will compete against the staff.

1398
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,459
Only one of these guns is filled with ink instead of water.

1399
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:26,630
Shoot your partner with a gun, and if it's filled with ink,

1400
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,729
- you'll compete against the staff. - Oh, my gosh.

1401
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,669
- Should we pick one? - Pick a gun.

1402
00:50:30,669 --> 00:50:31,700
Let's pick a gun.

1403
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,039
Eun Jung, pick one.

1404
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,140
- Jennie, pick one. - No.

1405
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,110
- You can shoot me with it. - Chi Yul.

1406
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,669
- Chi Yul. - Let's pick one.

1407
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:39,979
(They have to avoid the gun with ink.)

1408
00:50:39,979 --> 00:50:42,039
Competing against the staff is a bad idea.

1409
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,050
- It's a bad idea. - It has ink on it.

1410
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,410
(It has ink on it.)

1411
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:48,349
- I hope it's not. - Jisoo picked one,

1412
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:50,649
and why does it look darker?

1413
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,849
- No. - It looks dark inside.

1414
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,320
Let's start from Haha.

1415
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,559
(Haha and So Min)

1416
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,099
(So Min is usually unlucky. Which gun did she choose?)

1417
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,530
Okay.

1418
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:04,169
(Water)

1419
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:05,329
It's water.

1420
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,669
- It's water. - It is?

1421
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:09,399
- Okay. - It's pretty strong.

1422
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,070
- It shoots pretty strong. - Okay.

1423
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,809
(Jae Suk and Eun Jung)

1424
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:14,479
If it's ink, it's over.

1425
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:15,510
I hope it's ink.

1426
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:17,079
It'll be over.

1427
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,649
Eun Jung, please.

1428
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:20,220
(What will happen to the unlucky Jae Suk?)

1429
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,320
- It's water. - Okay.

1430
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,590
Hey, stop.

1431
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:27,559
(She keeps shooting even after seeing that it's water.)

1432
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:29,590
What are you doing?

1433
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:31,360
You saw it was water.

1434
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,590
(It was too fun to stop.)

1435
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,559
Okay. Good.

1436
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:35,729
Good.

1437
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:37,030
Okay.

1438
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,970
It must be us.

1439
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,300
(We must have the ink gun.)

1440
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,970
Jisoo.

1441
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,709
(Jisoo's gun had ink on it. Is it filled with ink?)

1442
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:48,039
(Yes! It's water.)

1443
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,880
- Only three teams are left. - It's one of three now.

1444
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,680
It's one of three now.

1445
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,380
- You'll shoot Ji Hyo? - Here we go.

1446
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,450
Okay.

1447
00:51:56,419 --> 00:51:58,820
If it's not ink, there will be two teams left.

1448
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,760
- Here we go. - Okay.

1449
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,590
It's ink.

1450
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:03,860
(With Chi Yul's good manners, they pass.)

1451
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:05,059
He has good manners.

1452
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:08,459
(With Chi Yul's good manners, they pass.)

1453
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,399
(He's so sweet.)

1454
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,570
They must have ink.

1455
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:17,510
It's ink.

1456
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,680
(It smells like ink around here.)

1457
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,610
- It must be Kwang Soo. - It's ink.

1458
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,550
- No. - It's Kwang Soo.

1459
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:26,349
It's 1 of the 2 Ddu-du Ddu-du

1460
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,919
(There are two teams left. Who will be shot with ink?)

1461
00:52:29,919 --> 00:52:31,619
Start.

1462
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,220
(Ink)

1463
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,860
(Even if the tool changes, Kwang Soo is always unlucky.)

1464
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,090
Who is it?

1465
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,499
(Even if the tool changes, Kwang Soo is always unlucky.)

1466
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:44,169
It's incredible.

1467
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:46,169
Who is it? Is it me?

1468
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:48,300
(Jennie, is it me?)

1469
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,939
How can this be possible?

1470
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:51,669
- What's incredible is, - It's unbelievable.

1471
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,740
Jennie picked the gun.

1472
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,709
Jennie picked it.

1473
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:01,149
Jennie, you're one of us.

1474
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,390
- Let me do it next time. - You're one of us.

1475
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,990
Let me do it.

1476
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,459
I'm fine.

1477
00:53:06,459 --> 00:53:08,419
- Let us wash it off. - Let us wash it off.

1478
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,729
We'll wash it off for you.

1479
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,860
There you go.

1480
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,200
- You're clean now. - You're clean now.

1481
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,599
It's done.

1482
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:21,099
You're clean now. You look good.

1483
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,970
Jennie picked it, but he still ends up unlucky.

1484
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:26,010
How is this possible?

1485
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:28,709
Kwang Soo's soul... I mean, impact...

1486
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:31,010
My soul? What are you talking about?

1487
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,410
What's wrong with my soul?

1488
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,249
You seem to make a lot of slips of the tongue.

1489
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:38,789
Why would she bring up my soul?

1490
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:40,559
It's what she really thinks.

1491
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,720
(Kwang Soo and Jennie will compete against the staff.)

1492
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:43,959
(Game Plan)

1493
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:47,800
Let's beat Jong Kook.

1494
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,229
It's going to be scary.

1495
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,999
Let's just look at the floor.

1496
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:54,869
If you just look at the floor...

1497
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,740
It looks hard.

1498
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,269
They're all people.

1499
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,709
(Suk Jin and Bora choose Horror Room.)

1500
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:01,840
Okay.

1501
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,749
- What should I do? - Let's do this. They're all people!

1502
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,749
1, 2, 3.

1503
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,519
- They're all humans. - I'm spilling so much water.

1504
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:13,820
(Suk Jin walks behind.)

1505
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,919
- Gosh. - I was startled.

1506
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,890
(Ladies first.)

1507
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:19,899
What is that?

1508
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,430
- What's that? - Suk Jin.

1509
00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:23,499
(Follow me.)

1510
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:25,269
- We're spilling a lot of water. - What should I do?

1511
00:54:25,269 --> 00:54:26,970
We're spilling so much water.

1512
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:32,169
(I've been waiting for you.)

1513
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:35,010
(Screaming)

1514
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:37,780
(They spill a lot of water.)

1515
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,950
This is so scary.

1516
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,149
Go away!

1517
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:42,880
(I was so startled.)

1518
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,119
My heart almost burst.

1519
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,019
Almost half of my water is gone.

1520
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:50,459
Hurry up! Why am I ahead of you?

1521
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,890
Why are you ahead of me?

1522
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:56,329
Let's go. Be careful.

1523
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,829
Be careful.

1524
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:00,399
Both hands.

1525
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:01,439
Wait.

1526
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:02,970
All right.

1527
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,610
(With mirrors everywhere, it's hard to find a way out.)

1528
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,410
This way.

1529
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:09,439
- I think I got this. - You're amazing.

1530
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,979
Jisoo, you're so good.

1531
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,050
This way. And...

1532
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,320
(She is going through the maze so fast.)

1533
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,649
You said you're bad with directions.

1534
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,590
- But I somehow see the way. - I start to see it too.

1535
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,919
I'm doing so good.

1536
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,459
You are.

1537
00:55:23,459 --> 00:55:26,559
(Jong Kook and Jisoo are moving fast.)

1538
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,160
Why am I ahead of you?

1539
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,200
(Suk Jin and Bora are bickering.)

1540
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,200
Why are you...

1541
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,599
(Screaming)

1542
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,869
(Scared)

1543
00:55:35,869 --> 00:55:37,140
No.

1544
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:39,840
- Go away! - My side hurts.

1545
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:42,039
Let's hurry up.

1546
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,910
(Screaming)

1547
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,979
(As former singers, both of them have loud voices.)

1548
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:49,519
I was so startled.

1549
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:51,490
(Screaming)

1550
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:53,090
- Who just screamed? - Me.

1551
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,419
It was me.

1552
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:56,930
Are we done?

1553
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:58,630
(They finally escape Horror Room.)

1554
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,660
- Did we win or lose? - Let's hurry.

1555
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,499
- Can we put the glass down? - No.

1556
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:03,970
You can put it down.

1557
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:05,369
(Were they faster than Jong Kook and Jisoo?)

1558
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:06,539
Let's beat Jong Kook.

1559
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:08,970
(Were they faster than Jong Kook and Jisoo?)

1560
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:13,039
(Hi, we're already here.)

1561
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,180
Gosh, we lost.

1562
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,809
(Why couldn't we be faster?)

1563
00:56:16,709 --> 00:56:18,649
Jisoo was amazing.

1564
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:20,419
She was so good at finding the way.

1565
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:21,419
(The maze queen)

1566
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:22,919
- Gosh. - Look at this.

1567
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:24,590
As you came last,

1568
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,390
you'll lose half of your water.

1569
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:29,590
What should we do?

1570
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,059
Jong Kook and Jisoo win.

1571
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:35,300
- Good work. - How...

1572
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,200
The winners can...

1573
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:41,499
go on the slide and have fun.

1574
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:45,269
- Gosh! - It's so cold.

1575
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,910
(It's extremely fast.)

1576
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:49,979
It's so cold.

1577
00:56:49,979 --> 00:56:51,579
(It's extremely fast.)

1578
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:56,050
(At the end of every long tunnel...)

1579
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,320
(lies a turning point.)

1580
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:01,820
(Excited)

1581
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,829
What will happen now?

1582
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:08,260
(Suk Jin and Bora are waiting at the end.)

1583
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,329
Please have a seat and wait.

1584
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,470
(We're jealous.)

1585
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:13,340
- Jisoo, was it fun? - Yes.

1586
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,970
- You can rely on me. - Okay.

1587
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,439
Let's win.

1588
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:21,740
(They put the glass over their heads.)

1589
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,809
Over our heads?

1590
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,720
(Eun Jung's camera is dipped in the water.)

1591
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,119
- Hold on. - Eun Jung.

1592
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,550
- Hey. - Please fill my glass again.

1593
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:32,090
- Please fill it again. - Eun Jung.

1594
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:34,320
Why did you spill the water?

1595
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,789
It bumped into my camera.

1596
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,090
You have to keep your hands on your glass.

1597
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:40,229
- Gosh. - We better hurry.

1598
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,430
(Jae Suk is scared as usual.)

1599
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,499
- I'm not scared at all. - Eun Jung.

1600
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:46,700
I'm not scared.

1601
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,369
Hey, I'm confused.

1602
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:51,570
- Follow me. - You're so good at this.

1603
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:52,869
We're done!

1604
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:54,740
Were we late?

1605
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,649
(Thanks to Eun Jung, Jae Suk's team wins.)

1606
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,979
(Round 2 ends with the winners going on the slide.)

1607
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,789
- Hey. - This is fun.

1608
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:05,149
- Mirror Room. - Mirror Room.

1609
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,249
We want Mirror Room.

1610
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:07,320
We're cowards.

1611
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,619
1, 2, 3.

1612
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,260
Okay. Mirror Room.

1613
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,689
- It'll be scary for you. - What should we do?

1614
00:58:11,689 --> 00:58:13,430
Where should we go? It's blocked here.

1615
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:14,700
It's blocked here.

1616
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,899
- Let's hurry. - Let's hurry.

1617
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:18,099
- We should hurry. - We're done.

1618
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,899
I didn't scream once.

1619
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,269
(Haha plugged his ears with tissues.)

1620
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:24,039
Hurry up, cowards!

1621
00:58:24,039 --> 00:58:25,709
It worked really well.

1622
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:28,479
This is fun.

1623
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,149
(They slide down as fast as they went through Horror Room.)

1624
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:32,579
This is fun.

1625
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,720
It was so fun.

1626
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:38,090
Kwang Soo, you can choose between Horror Room and Mirror Room.

1627
00:58:39,019 --> 00:58:41,720
- What do you want? - Horror Room is faster.

1628
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,930
If you keep going forward, it won't take long.

1629
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,899
We want Horror Room.

1630
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,130
(Jennie confidently chooses Horror Room.)

1631
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:51,530
You can go to Horror Room.

1632
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,039
Hold on.

1633
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:54,240
- Then... - 1, 2, 3.

1634
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,640
We choose Horror Room.

1635
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,910
You have chosen your room.

1636
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,169
Horror Room?

1637
00:58:58,169 --> 00:58:59,340
Good luck.

1638
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,809
What should we do?

1639
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:02,380
Jennie, you should lead Kwang Soo.

1640
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:04,280
Kwang Soo.

1641
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,050
- Kwang Soo... - Do you want to lead or follow?

1642
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,880
Are you confident?

1643
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,919
If you're not, I can lead.

1644
00:59:10,919 --> 00:59:12,890
(I have an iron heart.)

1645
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:14,289
I think I can do this.

1646
00:59:14,419 --> 00:59:16,459
To win, you should let me lead.

1647
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:18,760
All right. I respect your opinion.

1648
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:19,800
(Thank you.)

1649
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,200
- Follow me. - Okay.

1650
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,630
1, 2, 3.

1651
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:31,610
(Yelling)

1652
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:36,610
(She advances boldly while yelling.)

1653
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:41,749
Why is she... Wait for me, Jennie. Jennie!

1654
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:43,990
- Jennie, wait for me! - Oh, my gosh!

1655
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:47,490
(Haunted house is nothing.)

1656
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:49,789
(Hi, Jennie.)

1657
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:52,229
- Oh, my gosh! - Wait for me, Jennie!

1658
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,530
(She was full of confidence, but she goes back the way she came.)

1659
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:55,559
Wait for me!

1660
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,329
(Screaming)

1661
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:59,399
- What's wrong? - I'm scared.

1662
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,140
What is it? What's wrong, Jennie?

1663
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:02,800
I was in a hurry, and I got scared.

1664
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,640
- Where? - There's a person here.

1665
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,709
- Where? - There's a person in the corner.

1666
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:10,110
(Shouting)

1667
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:14,979
(This is a wailing duet.)

1668
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,720
(Jennie said she wasn't scared.)

1669
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
Hold on. Jennie.

1670
01:00:20,919 --> 01:00:22,590
- I'm so scared. I can't keep going. - Jennie.

1671
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,030
I'll go first.

1672
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,260
Please. Let's go.

1673
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,800
- I'm so scared. - There's nothing, Jennie.

1674
01:00:30,819 --> 01:00:32,490
- I'm so scared. I can't keep going. - Jennie.

1675
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,919
I'll go first.

1676
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:37,160
Please. Let's go.

1677
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,330
- I'm so scared. - There's nothing, Jennie.

1678
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:44,929
(You're a woman with unexpected charms.)

1679
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:47,899
What do I do? Do I go first?

1680
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:50,908
- You go first. - Okay.

1681
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:53,338
Jennie, are you okay?

1682
01:00:53,378 --> 01:00:55,309
Jennie. All right.

1683
01:00:55,309 --> 01:00:58,349
She's crying. Jennie's crying!

1684
01:00:58,548 --> 01:01:01,119
It's okay, Jennie. Look at my back.

1685
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,789
Don't cry. Look at my back.

1686
01:01:02,919 --> 01:01:05,649
Can I go first? I think it'll scare me.

1687
01:01:05,649 --> 01:01:07,789
- Who will? It won't. - This one.

1688
01:01:07,889 --> 01:01:10,459
- It won't scare you. - I think it will.

1689
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,729
No, it won't. You can go first. I'll be here.

1690
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:14,829
(Move over, softie. I'll take the lead.)

1691
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:16,628
- Go first. - I'm so scared.

1692
01:01:16,628 --> 01:01:18,528
Stay there. I'll go first.

1693
01:01:18,628 --> 01:01:20,399
(Screaming)

1694
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:23,508
- Jennie! - Goodness.

1695
01:01:23,508 --> 01:01:24,809
(What is that laughter?)

1696
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:28,039
Jennie, get up.

1697
01:01:28,178 --> 01:01:31,408
- Get up. I'll go first. - Goodness.

1698
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:32,479
I'll go first.

1699
01:01:32,919 --> 01:01:34,349
Jennie!

1700
01:01:34,619 --> 01:01:37,088
(She flings the water glass.)

1701
01:01:37,088 --> 01:01:39,988
Stay still, Jennie. I'll go first.

1702
01:01:40,088 --> 01:01:43,528
Don't move, Jennie.

1703
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:45,289
(Why did you say you'd go first?)

1704
01:01:45,428 --> 01:01:47,928
- Who said this wasn't scary. - It's okay.

1705
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:49,729
It's fine.

1706
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:53,198
- Don't do it. - Okay. They won't.

1707
01:01:53,238 --> 01:01:54,439
It's over.

1708
01:01:55,068 --> 01:01:58,338
- I'm scared too. - I think this will scare me.

1709
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:01,209
- It won't. - It will.

1710
01:02:01,209 --> 01:02:02,238
(Look out.)

1711
01:02:02,749 --> 01:02:04,908
(They collapse.)

1712
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,178
(Kwang Soo's glass is almost empty too.)

1713
01:02:08,178 --> 01:02:10,488
Stop it!

1714
01:02:10,488 --> 01:02:13,818
- They will. - Stop it.

1715
01:02:13,818 --> 01:02:15,358
It's already over.

1716
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:18,128
- It's looking at me. - Who's looking at you?

1717
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:20,858
- Okay, I'll stay here. - What now?

1718
01:02:20,928 --> 01:02:23,669
Get up. Okay.

1719
01:02:23,729 --> 01:02:27,198
You won't die. Walk along the wall.

1720
01:02:27,198 --> 01:02:29,369
- It's looking at me. - Okay, come here.

1721
01:02:29,369 --> 01:02:30,769
Come here.

1722
01:02:30,908 --> 01:02:32,639
- Okay. - What do I do?

1723
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,378
- You said it won't scare me. - It won't anymore.

1724
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:38,209
I'll go first.

1725
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:40,979
- This is going to shake. - It won't.

1726
01:02:40,979 --> 01:02:43,789
- I think it will. - It's a normal bridge.

1727
01:02:43,818 --> 01:02:46,858
- I think there will be a hand. - No, there won't be.

1728
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:49,528
Stop, who is this? What do I do?

1729
01:02:49,729 --> 01:02:51,358
- I'm going to go. - Should I go first?

1730
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:52,899
I think there will be a person here.

1731
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,999
- I'll go first. Hold on. - Let's go together.

1732
01:02:54,999 --> 01:02:57,369
- Okay. - Let's go together. Hurry.

1733
01:02:57,369 --> 01:02:59,539
- Hurry up. - Okay.

1734
01:02:59,539 --> 01:03:00,999
- I'm scared. - All right.

1735
01:03:01,269 --> 01:03:02,269
That startled...

1736
01:03:02,269 --> 01:03:03,439
(Shouting)

1737
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:08,378
(Kwang Soo is so tall that his glass touches the ghost.)

1738
01:03:09,008 --> 01:03:11,378
That startled me. Something hit me.

1739
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:12,919
I hit something.

1740
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,818
It's okay. It's over.

1741
01:03:16,818 --> 01:03:18,749
- I'm scared. - It's over, Jennie.

1742
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:20,158
Jennie, it's okay.

1743
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:23,928
(She looks like a female soldier exiting the CBR training.)

1744
01:03:24,588 --> 01:03:25,658
It's okay.

1745
01:03:25,658 --> 01:03:27,499
They said nothing pops out.

1746
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:28,758
Who said that?

1747
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:31,028
Bora did.

1748
01:03:31,028 --> 01:03:33,468
- Bora said that? - Yes, she said nothing pops out.

1749
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:36,468
- It's okay. It's over. - I thought it'd be okay,

1750
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:38,869
- but it was so scary. - I know.

1751
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:42,608
- What do I do? - Good job. It's over.

1752
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:47,119
It's over. You can stop crying.

1753
01:03:47,718 --> 01:03:49,349
Hey!

1754
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:52,519
(Hey! You staff members!)

1755
01:03:55,258 --> 01:03:56,588
Look at her.

1756
01:03:58,528 --> 01:04:00,628
- They said nothing pops out... - I know!

1757
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,658
from the bottom.

1758
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,999
We're really sorry,

1759
01:04:05,528 --> 01:04:07,468
- but you lost. - We know.

1760
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,838
- We know. - I gave up from the beginning.

1761
01:04:10,209 --> 01:04:11,669
I didn't know Jennie would...

1762
01:04:12,468 --> 01:04:15,108
She bawled as soon as we went in.

1763
01:04:16,378 --> 01:04:18,108
Jennie.

1764
01:04:18,108 --> 01:04:20,778
I was so scared. I'm sorry.

1765
01:04:21,718 --> 01:04:24,548
She started speaking casually to me.

1766
01:04:24,548 --> 01:04:26,658
(She started speaking casually to me.)

1767
01:04:27,818 --> 01:04:30,329
The cowards are coming down.

1768
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:32,358
- They're coming. - Jennie.

1769
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:34,229
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1770
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:36,899
You lied.

1771
01:04:36,899 --> 01:04:39,899
- I think... - There were people scaring me.

1772
01:04:39,899 --> 01:04:42,198
she's the biggest coward I've seen in my life.

1773
01:04:43,169 --> 01:04:45,568
In my life.

1774
01:04:45,608 --> 01:04:47,709
Are you okay?

1775
01:04:47,709 --> 01:04:49,778
Yes.

1776
01:04:50,209 --> 01:04:51,479
What's wrong?

1777
01:04:51,479 --> 01:04:54,079
She bawled as soon as we went in.

1778
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:56,289
"I'll go first. Follow me."

1779
01:04:56,419 --> 01:04:59,519
She screamed, and she continued to cry.

1780
01:04:59,818 --> 01:05:01,389
She kept on crying.

1781
01:05:01,758 --> 01:05:04,829
You said it wasn't scary.

1782
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:06,999
- I did. - Why did you lie?

1783
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:10,128
Why did you say that? Why did you lie to her?

1784
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:11,669
- Apologize to her. - But...

1785
01:05:11,669 --> 01:05:14,698
isn't she so cute?

1786
01:05:14,698 --> 01:05:17,008
(Jennie is so cute when she cries.)

1787
01:05:17,008 --> 01:05:20,079
- Don't go there. - She is. I made this happen.

1788
01:05:21,108 --> 01:05:22,639
You should treat me to lunch.

1789
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:24,749
She started speaking casually to me.

1790
01:05:24,749 --> 01:05:27,979
- What did she say? - "Hurry!"

1791
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:32,189
"Hurry up!" "Go before somebody pops out. Hurry!"

1792
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:36,628
Jennie was probably scared,

1793
01:05:36,658 --> 01:05:38,689
but that was the best scene.

1794
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:41,528
- That was. - Since Choi Ji Woo.

1795
01:05:42,128 --> 01:05:44,399
This will get five million views online.

1796
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:46,838
- Goodness. - I made something incredible.

1797
01:05:47,269 --> 01:05:50,008
Decide if you're going to keep the bag or switch.

1798
01:05:50,008 --> 01:05:52,108
We'll switch. We have something ready.

1799
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,539
- We already have a plan. - We do.

1800
01:05:54,539 --> 01:05:58,309
- Who would you like to switch with? - Bora's pouch.

1801
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:59,649
- Me? - Bora?

1802
01:06:00,718 --> 01:06:02,119
Bora's pouch.

1803
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:04,818
(Are they certain about switching with Suk Jin and Bora?)

1804
01:06:05,749 --> 01:06:08,488
(When they were selecting briefcases)

1805
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:10,928
(This is awesome, Jae Suk.)

1806
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,329
(Jong Kook saw us.)

1807
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:18,729
(Eun Jung's reaction was too big.)

1808
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:21,269
(We caught them. Jae Suk has a heart card.)

1809
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:24,309
We'll take Jae Suk's.

1810
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:25,468
All right.

1811
01:06:25,468 --> 01:06:27,809
(Jae Suk had a heart card, and he switched with Bora.)

1812
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:30,309
- Switch. - What's this? Is this a dud?

1813
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:34,019
- This. - Please check separately.

1814
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:36,249
- Can we check now? - Yes, you can.

1815
01:06:36,649 --> 01:06:39,318
- It's a bomb card. I'm 100 percent. - Right?

1816
01:06:41,088 --> 01:06:44,459
(As predicted, it's a bomb card.)

1817
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:46,899
Oh, gosh. It's for sure.

1818
01:06:46,899 --> 01:06:48,399
I knew it.

1819
01:06:48,928 --> 01:06:51,928
- Where is it? Here it is. - Open it.

1820
01:06:51,928 --> 01:06:52,999
(Yes, we got a heart card.)

1821
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:56,408
(Who has the remaining heart and bomb cards then?)

1822
01:06:57,508 --> 01:06:58,909
Here are the rules.

1823
01:06:58,909 --> 01:07:01,708
This is the last chance to earn a heart card...

1824
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:03,849
or get rid of your bomb card.

1825
01:07:04,008 --> 01:07:06,349
It's Ready to Burst.

1826
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:07,548
(Last mission of Catch My Heart: Ready to Burst)

1827
01:07:07,548 --> 01:07:09,819
You have 30 minutes in this race.

1828
01:07:09,819 --> 01:07:13,218
With the conclusion of the race, the couple with two bomb cards...

1829
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,328
will get the water bomb as a penalty.

1830
01:07:16,328 --> 01:07:17,359
Really?

1831
01:07:18,088 --> 01:07:19,128
Both of them?

1832
01:07:19,128 --> 01:07:22,029
If two couples have a bomb card each,

1833
01:07:22,029 --> 01:07:24,229
they'll face off to decide on one couple.

1834
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:27,269
You have a chance to earn a heart card...

1835
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:30,139
when you go on rides with R flags.

1836
01:07:30,368 --> 01:07:32,368
Once you reach the bottom of the ride, there will be three bags.

1837
01:07:32,368 --> 01:07:35,609
1 bag contains the heart card, and the other 2 are empty.

1838
01:07:36,508 --> 01:07:39,078
If there's a team with a heart card,

1839
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:42,449
you can get lucky and pick another heart card to escape.

1840
01:07:42,449 --> 01:07:45,349
(If you get lucky, you can go on one ride and go home.)

1841
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,189
- That's good. - Okay!

1842
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:48,659
Does Jong Kook have two heart cards?

1843
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:52,328
It's so obvious, Jong Kook. Do you have two?

1844
01:07:52,828 --> 01:07:54,859
- I guess you have one. - Okay!

1845
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,828
The couple that earns two heart cards win.

1846
01:07:57,998 --> 01:08:01,699
You get prizes according to how fast you complete the mission.

1847
01:08:01,968 --> 01:08:06,508
If you have a bomb card, you cannot go on any rides.

1848
01:08:06,538 --> 01:08:07,578
Oh, my gosh.

1849
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:10,309
(If you have a bomb card, you cannot go on any rides.)

1850
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:12,508
If you have a bomb card,

1851
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:15,449
you have to rip somebody's name tag and pass on your bomb card.

1852
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:16,519
Rip their name tags off?

1853
01:08:16,519 --> 01:08:18,418
You pass on your bomb card by ripping name tags off.

1854
01:08:18,718 --> 01:08:20,458
Can we rip off one person's name tag from the couple?

1855
01:08:20,458 --> 01:08:21,718
(You can choose who you want to trade with.)

1856
01:08:21,718 --> 01:08:22,828
I'm getting goosebumps.

1857
01:08:23,328 --> 01:08:25,189
- Really? - I am.

1858
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,998
(That didn't sound true at all.)

1859
01:08:26,998 --> 01:08:28,458
Stop acting, Jisoo.

1860
01:08:28,928 --> 01:08:30,229
That was bad acting.

1861
01:08:30,229 --> 01:08:31,699
What? Say it. What is it?

1862
01:08:31,699 --> 01:08:34,699
If you're not going on a ride, it means you have a bomb card.

1863
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:37,008
(Couples with bomb cards will be after people's name tags.)

1864
01:08:37,008 --> 01:08:39,239
They'll be going around to rip people's name tags.

1865
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,109
All right. You can move to your designated spots.

1866
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:43,678
(Which couple will end up getting the penalty?)

1867
01:08:45,178 --> 01:08:47,878
(Final race is ready to begin.)

1868
01:08:47,878 --> 01:08:50,819
People who know what we have are Kwang Soo...

1869
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:52,859
- Four people know what we have. - That's right.

1870
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:54,758
- They know you have the bomb card. - That's right.

1871
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,659
Let's go on the rides the whole time, okay?

1872
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:58,788
- We have to get rid of the bomb. - Yes, let's get rid of it first.

1873
01:08:58,788 --> 01:08:59,928
- Let's get rid of it fast. - Okay.

1874
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:01,128
We can't go on any rides with the bomb card.

1875
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:04,029
People I have to watch out are...

1876
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:06,639
- Bora. Her team. - Yes, Bora for sure.

1877
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:08,439
What do we do?

1878
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:10,109
We have to go on the rides.

1879
01:09:10,809 --> 01:09:12,909
Let's go on as many rides as possible.

1880
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:14,538
Let's not get on the scary ones.

1881
01:09:14,538 --> 01:09:16,178
Let's get on the scary ones. I like those types of rides.

1882
01:09:16,578 --> 01:09:17,678
- Stop lying. - I'm serious.

1883
01:09:17,678 --> 01:09:19,078
I really like them.

1884
01:09:19,248 --> 01:09:21,019
You said you'd go first.

1885
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,218
I was scared of people popping out.

1886
01:09:24,218 --> 01:09:25,649
I think you are...

1887
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:26,859
all bluff.

1888
01:09:27,618 --> 01:09:29,059
- I'm not. - I think so.

1889
01:09:29,659 --> 01:09:31,389
Let's go on a ride. I'll show you.

1890
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,659
I'll prove it to you.

1891
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:35,428
Protect me, Ji Hyo.

1892
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:37,029
What?

1893
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:38,899
I'm joking.

1894
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:41,668
Do you think Ye Jin has a heart card?

1895
01:09:42,298 --> 01:09:44,038
- Ye Jin? - I think...

1896
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,668
she has a heart card.

1897
01:09:45,968 --> 01:09:47,378
You've been on rides before, right?

1898
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:49,008
- Yes. I'm scared. - You're just nervous.

1899
01:09:49,708 --> 01:09:50,779
I'm nervous.

1900
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:53,449
(5 seconds before the start of the race)

1901
01:09:53,449 --> 01:09:56,118
(4 seconds before the start of the race)

1902
01:09:56,548 --> 01:09:58,288
2, 1.

1903
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:00,389
- One. Race starts. - Let's go.

1904
01:10:00,389 --> 01:10:04,628
(The final race starts.)

1905
01:10:05,088 --> 01:10:07,328
- Watch your back. - Okay.

1906
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,328
- We have to look around. - Look around.

1907
01:10:10,229 --> 01:10:13,099
Let's get two heart cards fast and finish this.

1908
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:16,109
We have to go on it. We have to hurry.

1909
01:10:16,109 --> 01:10:18,439
(Kwang Soo and Jennie run to a ride.)

1910
01:10:18,569 --> 01:10:20,508
- Kwang Soo. - We're okay.

1911
01:10:20,809 --> 01:10:22,038
I have no energy.

1912
01:10:22,038 --> 01:10:23,479
(Wait for me.)

1913
01:10:24,449 --> 01:10:25,849
I have no energy.

1914
01:10:25,849 --> 01:10:28,118
(She runs out of energy 30 seconds into the race.)

1915
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:32,189
Stairs...

1916
01:10:32,288 --> 01:10:33,359
Stairs...

1917
01:10:33,418 --> 01:10:34,788
- Hold on. - I'm bad with stairs.

1918
01:10:34,788 --> 01:10:35,859
Hang in there. We're almost there.

1919
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:37,489
I'll slow down.

1920
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:40,128
You're bad in everything, not just stairs.

1921
01:10:40,498 --> 01:10:42,628
Let's hurry. We have to hurry.

1922
01:10:42,968 --> 01:10:43,998
- Jennie. - Stairs.

1923
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:45,298
Hang in there.

1924
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:46,939
- I'm bad with stairs. - We're almost there.

1925
01:10:46,998 --> 01:10:48,599
You're bad with scary things too.

1926
01:10:48,899 --> 01:10:49,909
Jennie.

1927
01:10:49,909 --> 01:10:51,038
(She has a soft heart, and she's unfit too.)

1928
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,069
Oh, dear.

1929
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:54,208
We're almost there. We're here.

1930
01:10:54,979 --> 01:10:56,109
Stairs.

1931
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:57,309
It's high.

1932
01:10:57,309 --> 01:10:58,878
(What's waiting for Jennie?)

1933
01:10:58,878 --> 01:11:00,019
It's high.

1934
01:11:00,019 --> 01:11:04,389
(It's a very tall water slide.)

1935
01:11:08,359 --> 01:11:09,588
It looks fun.

1936
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,258
Yes.

1937
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:13,859
Let's go, Kwang Soo.

1938
01:11:14,599 --> 01:11:15,729
What are you saying?

1939
01:11:16,099 --> 01:11:17,668
Don't say that.

1940
01:11:17,668 --> 01:11:19,099
- It looks fun. - What's that?

1941
01:11:19,798 --> 01:11:20,998
I can't do this.

1942
01:11:20,998 --> 01:11:22,298
I don't think I can do this.

1943
01:11:22,639 --> 01:11:23,809
- The mic. - We have to take it out.

1944
01:11:23,868 --> 01:11:25,239
Take yours out.

1945
01:11:25,309 --> 01:11:26,639
I didn't know it was like this.

1946
01:11:26,779 --> 01:11:27,979
Let's go right away.

1947
01:11:28,038 --> 01:11:29,078
I can't.

1948
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,748
Kwang Soo, let's go.

1949
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:32,248
I don't think I can, Jennie.

1950
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:33,678
I...

1951
01:11:33,678 --> 01:11:35,019
(I don't think I can go on this.)

1952
01:11:35,019 --> 01:11:36,949
Is this scary?

1953
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:38,248
I don't think it is.

1954
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:41,258
You're okay.

1955
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,059
I can't go on rides like these.

1956
01:11:43,689 --> 01:11:44,758
You're going.

1957
01:11:45,128 --> 01:11:46,529
Bye.

1958
01:11:46,828 --> 01:11:49,099
(Kwang Soo is frightened.)

1959
01:11:50,069 --> 01:11:51,998
(Sliding)

1960
01:11:52,022 --> 01:11:57,022
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E409 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"Catch My Heart"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1961
01:11:57,468 --> 01:12:00,279
(This is so much fun.)

1962
01:12:03,609 --> 01:12:05,809
(This is too exciting. Help me.)

1963
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,519
Please.

1964
01:12:09,519 --> 01:12:11,748
Please stop.

1965
01:12:13,389 --> 01:12:16,559
(Giggling)

1966
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:21,199
(Kwang Soo screams at the top of his lungs.)

1967
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,258
Please stop.

1968
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:26,338
(The ride is over.)

1969
01:12:27,769 --> 01:12:31,109
(You can see from his face how spectacular this ride was.)

1970
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:34,838
That was fun.

1971
01:12:36,178 --> 01:12:38,248
Kwang Soo, let's do this again.

1972
01:12:38,248 --> 01:12:39,279
We can't.

1973
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:40,779
(I've had enough thrill with this one ride.)

1974
01:12:40,779 --> 01:12:42,019
I don't think I can do this.

1975
01:12:42,019 --> 01:12:43,449
- Let's go again, Kwang Soo. - I want to stop.

1976
01:12:43,548 --> 01:12:45,019
I'd rather face a penalty.

1977
01:12:45,548 --> 01:12:46,758
I can't do this.

1978
01:12:46,758 --> 01:12:48,618
- Let's do this. - I can't.

1979
01:12:48,618 --> 01:12:51,689
(There are 3 suitcases in front of them...)

1980
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:52,859
(on the bottom of the ride.)

1981
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:55,729
- One suitcase has a heart card. - Yes.

1982
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,569
It's in 1 of 3 bags.

1983
01:12:57,569 --> 01:12:58,668
You can pick now.

1984
01:12:58,668 --> 01:12:59,739
Which one would you like?

1985
01:12:59,739 --> 01:13:00,838
I pick the first one.

1986
01:13:00,838 --> 01:13:01,838
(She doesn't hesitate.)

1987
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,609
This was a bomb card earlier. I brought the first briefcase.

1988
01:13:05,668 --> 01:13:06,678
Should we go with this?

1989
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:09,038
Let's go with this and go on another ride.

1990
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:11,178
Wait.

1991
01:13:11,748 --> 01:13:13,849
- I think this is a heart card. - If it is, I'll go on another ride.

1992
01:13:13,849 --> 01:13:15,248
If this is a heart card, I'll go on a ride you want.

1993
01:13:15,248 --> 01:13:17,288
If it's not, this is over.

1994
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:19,088
- It can't be over. - We'll see.

1995
01:13:19,088 --> 01:13:20,118
- Okay. - Okay.

1996
01:13:20,118 --> 01:13:23,229
- If it's a heart card, I'll go. - We'll head for the stairs.

1997
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:24,928
In 1, 2, 3.

1998
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:27,458
(It's a heart card.)

1999
01:13:28,628 --> 01:13:30,069
(Joy and sorrow)

2000
01:13:32,468 --> 01:13:33,838
We can go on again.

2001
01:13:34,739 --> 01:13:37,239
You can put it in your pouch.

2002
01:13:37,338 --> 01:13:38,338
Do you want to take it?

2003
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:39,479
Should I?

2004
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:42,208
(They put it in Jennie's bag.)

2005
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:44,708
Are you going on a ride again?

2006
01:13:44,779 --> 01:13:47,819
Yes, let's go. Let's get another heart card and take a break.

2007
01:13:50,449 --> 01:13:52,918
They'll know where we are because of the camera light.

2008
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,088
(Looking around)

2009
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,128
What's this?

2010
01:13:59,428 --> 01:14:01,428
(Grabbing)

2011
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:07,838
(It's Suk Jin and Bora's surprise attack.)

2012
01:14:08,868 --> 01:14:10,069
(Ji Hyo is an ace member. She defends herself by turning around.)

2013
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:11,208
That startled me.

2014
01:14:11,468 --> 01:14:12,468
Hold on.

2015
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:13,739
I almost got it.

2016
01:14:13,878 --> 01:14:15,139
Wait.

2017
01:14:15,309 --> 01:14:16,449
Hold on.

2018
01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:17,979
Wait.

2019
01:14:17,979 --> 01:14:19,349
- Why are you here? - Why are you here?

2020
01:14:19,479 --> 01:14:20,678
You must have a bomb card.

2021
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:22,689
- We have a bomb card too. - That's true.

2022
01:14:22,788 --> 01:14:23,849
- We're on the same side. - That's why...

2023
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:26,489
I asked you over there...

2024
01:14:26,489 --> 01:14:28,319
- what you had. - You have a bomb card?

2025
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,689
We have the bomb cards.

2026
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:32,699
- We have the bombs. - Right.

2027
01:14:32,758 --> 01:14:34,998
We have a bomb card too. I told you what I had.

2028
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:36,529
- See you later then. - I was looking for other people.

2029
01:14:36,529 --> 01:14:37,628
Okay.

2030
01:14:37,928 --> 01:14:39,229
Where do we go?

2031
01:14:40,599 --> 01:14:42,468
It's good we didn't rip theirs.

2032
01:14:42,468 --> 01:14:44,609
If we did, it would have been worse.

2033
01:14:44,708 --> 01:14:46,508
They could have died.

2034
01:14:46,508 --> 01:14:48,609
- We would get two or they would. - That's right.

2035
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,809
- There's somebody there. - I think it's a ride.

2036
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:52,008
Who's that?

2037
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,418
Did you get on a ride?

2038
01:14:53,418 --> 01:14:54,449
Did you...

2039
01:14:54,449 --> 01:14:55,849
(They were looking for a target. They find Se Chan and Ye Jin.)

2040
01:14:55,849 --> 01:14:56,918
Did you get on a ride?

2041
01:14:57,048 --> 01:14:58,588
This one's good.

2042
01:14:59,019 --> 01:15:00,659
- It's fun. - Is it good?

2043
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:01,958
I want to go on a ride. Do you want to go on it?

2044
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,359
- Okay. - Do you have a bomb card?

2045
01:15:03,428 --> 01:15:04,458
No!

2046
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,498
(They start hunting.)

2047
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:07,599
Stop it!

2048
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:10,628
(Give us your name tag and take our bomb card.)

2049
01:15:10,628 --> 01:15:12,199
No!

2050
01:15:15,099 --> 01:15:16,338
I have a bomb card.

2051
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:17,868
We do too.

2052
01:15:17,868 --> 01:15:19,269
(Goodness)

2053
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:20,538
Stop lying.

2054
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:21,909
(Ji Hyo has the bomb card.)

2055
01:15:22,008 --> 01:15:23,248
I ripped hers.

2056
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:24,909
(Se Chan rips Bora's name tag.)

2057
01:15:26,019 --> 01:15:30,748
(He has to switch with Suk Jin or Bora.)

2058
01:15:30,748 --> 01:15:32,048
(Se Chan and Ye Jin has the other bomb card.)

2059
01:15:32,048 --> 01:15:33,519
We have to act.

2060
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:36,828
Ji Hyo said she had the bomb card.

2061
01:15:36,828 --> 01:15:38,059
I don't think she does.

2062
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:39,659
(She tricked us.)

2063
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:40,828
She tricked us?

2064
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:43,328
You fool. You can't get flustered like that.

2065
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:46,639
- I was so flustered. - You fool.

2066
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:48,699
- Ji Hyo, you are the best. - You fool.

2067
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:50,569
You can't do that.

2068
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:53,578
Check, Se Chan.

2069
01:15:53,578 --> 01:15:55,239
- Is that yours? - Yes.

2070
01:15:55,909 --> 01:15:56,979
Check.

2071
01:15:57,078 --> 01:15:58,279
We have to go on a ride.

2072
01:15:58,279 --> 01:15:59,319
It's the same thing.

2073
01:15:59,519 --> 01:16:02,449
(They switched a bomb card for another one.)

2074
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:03,618
- We're back to square one. - Square one?

2075
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:05,248
Suk Jin.

2076
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:07,159
- Suk Jin! - What is this?

2077
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:09,428
- We're back to square one. - That's not it.

2078
01:16:09,428 --> 01:16:11,229
Hold on. Listen.

2079
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:12,559
- That's not why. - Listen to us.

2080
01:16:12,559 --> 01:16:14,199
You can't keep talking. Please go your separate ways.

2081
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,769
- That's not why. We got tricked. - You can't keep talking.

2082
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:19,199
- Let's go on a ride. - This is scarier.

2083
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:20,968
Sit here.

2084
01:16:21,468 --> 01:16:22,668
- Move in more. - It's cold.

2085
01:16:23,168 --> 01:16:25,239
Let's go.

2086
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:26,479
You're going down.

2087
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,378
It's so fast.

2088
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:32,649
Why is this so fast?

2089
01:16:33,519 --> 01:16:36,189
Oh, shoot.

2090
01:16:36,189 --> 01:16:38,088
Rainy days are perfect for going to waterparks.

2091
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:40,059
No. Hey.

2092
01:16:40,059 --> 01:16:41,788
It's going up too much.

2093
01:16:41,889 --> 01:16:44,059
(Yelling)

2094
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,458
(It goes up.)

2095
01:16:46,498 --> 01:16:48,559
(This is the highlight of this ride.)

2096
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:52,529
(There's a whirlwind.)

2097
01:16:53,338 --> 01:16:57,139
(It reaches the top then splashes again.)

2098
01:16:57,139 --> 01:16:59,639
(He's having fun.)

2099
01:17:00,578 --> 01:17:02,538
I almost died.

2100
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,979
This is fun.

2101
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:06,178
- This is? - It's fun.

2102
01:17:07,678 --> 01:17:09,019
Hurry. Pick this one.

2103
01:17:09,118 --> 01:17:10,218
We came here first.

2104
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:11,889
Pick this one.

2105
01:17:11,889 --> 01:17:13,059
(Will they pick a heart card in a game of chance?)

2106
01:17:13,059 --> 01:17:14,258
(What did Haha and So Min pick?)

2107
01:17:14,258 --> 01:17:15,389
Should I open it?

2108
01:17:15,389 --> 01:17:17,229
(What did Haha and So Min pick?)

2109
01:17:19,928 --> 01:17:21,059
It's empty.

2110
01:17:21,229 --> 01:17:22,258
I'm sorry.

2111
01:17:22,258 --> 01:17:23,998
(If they want to pick again, they have to go on another ride.)

2112
01:17:23,998 --> 01:17:25,199
Let's go on rides for two people.

2113
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:26,439
We have to start over again.

2114
01:17:26,439 --> 01:17:27,868
(Trudging)

2115
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:29,038
Let's go again.

2116
01:17:29,368 --> 01:17:31,008
Which one do you want to pick?

2117
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:32,508
This one?

2118
01:17:32,508 --> 01:17:33,838
- I was thinking of this one too. - Really?

2119
01:17:33,838 --> 01:17:35,008
- Yes. - Shall I open it?

2120
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:39,048
(Jong Kook and Jisoo have one heart card currently.)

2121
01:17:39,048 --> 01:17:42,378
(What will they pick?)

2122
01:17:42,889 --> 01:17:44,218
(There's no heart card.)

2123
01:17:44,218 --> 01:17:45,288
No?

2124
01:17:45,389 --> 01:17:47,218
(There's no heart card.)

2125
01:17:47,218 --> 01:17:49,088
- Oh, gosh. - What do we do?

2126
01:17:49,328 --> 01:17:51,189
- What do we do then? - What?

2127
01:17:51,189 --> 01:17:52,389
- We go on another ride. - Should I open the next one?

2128
01:17:52,628 --> 01:17:53,628
I can't, right?

2129
01:17:54,529 --> 01:17:55,828
That was good.

2130
01:17:55,828 --> 01:17:57,399
- That was natural. - That was.

2131
01:17:58,868 --> 01:18:00,668
- I think this is it. - What?

2132
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:04,508
- It's too long. - This one's really scary.

2133
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:07,338
- We can't. - Is this really scary, Eun Jung?

2134
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,548
(You go down on a mat.)

2135
01:18:10,008 --> 01:18:11,949
How long is the slide?

2136
01:18:12,849 --> 01:18:14,618
- 120m. - 150m?

2137
01:18:14,618 --> 01:18:16,288
I don't think I can ride this one.

2138
01:18:17,248 --> 01:18:20,989
(I can't believe we picked such a hardcore slide.)

2139
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,458
What should I do?

2140
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:24,389
Jae Suk, save me.

2141
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:25,659
- Eun Jung. - Save me.

2142
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:27,828
Eun Jung, I am scared too.

2143
01:18:28,029 --> 01:18:31,529
I can do everything but this.

2144
01:18:31,769 --> 01:18:32,968
What should I do?

2145
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:35,699
Eun Jung, I hate this too.

2146
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,409
- Eun Jung. - Jae Suk, save me.

2147
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:40,178
I hate this too.

2148
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:41,479
Hold on.

2149
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:42,878
(Eun Jung, we still need a heart card.)

2150
01:18:44,109 --> 01:18:47,149
(Don't leave me behind, Jae Suk.)

2151
01:18:47,149 --> 01:18:48,349
- Shall we go? - Yes.

2152
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,949
Okay. Thank you, Eun Jung.

2153
01:18:49,949 --> 01:18:51,248
- I will give you a signal. - Okay.

2154
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:53,189
Go when I tell you to go.

2155
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:55,458
Eun Jung, let's pick the right briefcase.

2156
01:18:55,588 --> 01:18:57,859
- For goodness' sake. - Okay.

2157
01:18:57,859 --> 01:19:00,099
- Get ready. - Let's get a heart card each.

2158
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:02,668
- Go. - Eun Jung, let's go.

2159
01:19:02,998 --> 01:19:04,928
(Eun Jung, let's go.)

2160
01:19:05,269 --> 01:19:07,798
(Screaming)

2161
01:19:10,309 --> 01:19:12,508
(Splash)

2162
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:16,349
(The water hits his face as he slides down.)

2163
01:19:16,449 --> 01:19:19,578
(Groaning)

2164
01:19:22,078 --> 01:19:23,218
Eun Jung!

2165
01:19:24,418 --> 01:19:25,519
Eun Jung!

2166
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:28,588
Eun Jung!

2167
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:32,489
Didn't she go down the slide?

2168
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:34,729
Didn't she go down the slide?

2169
01:19:35,659 --> 01:19:38,298
(Right before riding the slide)

2170
01:19:38,298 --> 01:19:39,769
(Halting)

2171
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:42,809
(Jae Suk's scream put the brakes on her.)

2172
01:19:42,809 --> 01:19:45,208
I am sorry.

2173
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,279
(Jae Suk, I can't do this. Go ahead.)

2174
01:19:47,409 --> 01:19:50,979
(Eun Jung, I am coming to get you.)

2175
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,878
(Kwang Soo and Jennie move in order to avoid the bombs.)

2176
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:56,349
I think they are hiding.

2177
01:19:57,149 --> 01:19:59,519
(Se Chan and Ye Jin are looking for preys.)

2178
01:19:59,989 --> 01:20:01,618
I am nervous.

2179
01:20:01,819 --> 01:20:04,389
Let's go where we came from.

2180
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:05,689
Okay. Let's go that way.

2181
01:20:08,798 --> 01:20:09,998
Hold on.

2182
01:20:09,998 --> 01:20:11,069
(Hold on.)

2183
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:12,668
- Hold on. - No, no.

2184
01:20:12,668 --> 01:20:14,099
- Come here. - Hold on.

2185
01:20:14,099 --> 01:20:15,968
- Come here. - Hold on.

2186
01:20:17,538 --> 01:20:19,439
It's about Se Chan.

2187
01:20:19,708 --> 01:20:21,038
- Se Chan? - It's about Se Chan.

2188
01:20:21,038 --> 01:20:23,508
(They pretend to share information and begin to attack.)

2189
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:26,078
(Ripping)

2190
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:27,449
I ripped it.

2191
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:28,649
(She rips his name tag.)

2192
01:20:28,819 --> 01:20:31,248
(Suk Jin and Bora get a chance to exchange their bag.)

2193
01:20:31,248 --> 01:20:33,218
- What was that? - I got my name tag ripped.

2194
01:20:33,218 --> 01:20:34,918
Kwang Soo!

2195
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:36,288
(Whose bag do they want?)

2196
01:20:36,288 --> 01:20:39,189
We want Jennie's bag.

2197
01:20:39,288 --> 01:20:40,529
Jennie's bag.

2198
01:20:40,529 --> 01:20:42,399
- Whose bag will you give her? - I will give her my bag.

2199
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:43,399
Make an exchange.

2200
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:44,998
Shall we check what's inside?

2201
01:20:44,998 --> 01:20:46,439
- Please spread out first. - Okay.

2202
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:48,498
Let's go.

2203
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:49,639
(Thanks to their surprise hunt,)

2204
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:50,708
A heart card.

2205
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:52,878
(they get a heart card.)

2206
01:20:52,878 --> 01:20:54,609
(We can escape if we get one more heart card.)

2207
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:55,909
I showed it to them.

2208
01:20:56,178 --> 01:20:57,649
Hello, you are a familiar card.

2209
01:20:58,508 --> 01:21:00,618
Hello, you are a familiar card.

2210
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:01,779
In the beginning,

2211
01:21:02,048 --> 01:21:04,118
- we brought it into the world. - It has been a while. That's right.

2212
01:21:04,118 --> 01:21:05,489
It's our baby.

2213
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:06,718
It came home.

2214
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:10,258
- Welcome home. - Our baby came home.

2215
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:11,628
It grew up...

2216
01:21:11,628 --> 01:21:12,958
and came back as an adult.

2217
01:21:13,099 --> 01:21:15,229
You have to rip another team member's name tag...

2218
01:21:15,229 --> 01:21:16,628
- and give away the bomb card. - Okay.

2219
01:21:16,628 --> 01:21:17,699
(They have to give away the bomb card.)

2220
01:21:19,368 --> 01:21:22,368
(Haha and So Min enjoy the ride to get a heart card.)

2221
01:21:22,368 --> 01:21:23,739
- What is this? - What is this?

2222
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:25,909
(Screaming)

2223
01:21:26,309 --> 01:21:28,909
(Heart cards, here we come.)

2224
01:21:30,949 --> 01:21:32,279
That was fun.

2225
01:21:32,779 --> 01:21:35,418
- That was incredible. - That was fun.

2226
01:21:35,418 --> 01:21:37,748
I can't believe I went on this ride.

2227
01:21:38,618 --> 01:21:40,019
(The coward, Haha go on an adventure for heart cards.)

2228
01:21:40,019 --> 01:21:41,059
I believe in you.

2229
01:21:41,059 --> 01:21:42,489
You should pick this time.

2230
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:43,828
However, I think it's this one.

2231
01:21:44,588 --> 01:21:45,998
You should pick this time.

2232
01:21:45,998 --> 01:21:47,099
(One of the three briefcases has a heart card.)

2233
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:49,159
- Here we go. - Please.

2234
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:50,168
(Let's see if Haha gets a heart card.)

2235
01:21:50,168 --> 01:21:52,269
You picked this one earlier, right? It can't be this one.

2236
01:21:52,868 --> 01:21:54,939
You picked this one earlier, right? It can't be this one.

2237
01:21:54,939 --> 01:21:56,168
- It's this one. - Okay.

2238
01:21:56,168 --> 01:21:57,239
(He chooses a briefcase that is without So Min's bad luck.)

2239
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:59,069
Please. Please.

2240
01:21:59,069 --> 01:22:00,139
Please let it be inside.

2241
01:22:00,878 --> 01:22:01,979
Please. Please.

2242
01:22:05,248 --> 01:22:07,949
(They get a heart card.)

2243
01:22:07,949 --> 01:22:09,418
- We have two heart cards now. - This is insane.

2244
01:22:09,418 --> 01:22:10,449
We have two heart cards now.

2245
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:11,489
(Do Haha and So Min have two heart cards?)

2246
01:22:11,489 --> 01:22:13,019
Let's take a look.

2247
01:22:14,618 --> 01:22:15,689
This is incredible.

2248
01:22:15,689 --> 01:22:17,958
(Haha and So Min's first briefcase contained a heart card.)

2249
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:19,059
Not too bad.

2250
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,258
(She kept a poker face.)

2251
01:22:20,998 --> 01:22:21,998
- In 2, 3. - In 2, 3.

2252
01:22:21,998 --> 01:22:23,199
(Here are the two heart cards.)

2253
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,868
- You succeeded. - Yes!

2254
01:22:24,868 --> 01:22:25,899
Yes!

2255
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:27,368
(We are on the 1st place.)

2256
01:22:27,468 --> 01:22:30,239
(They celebrate their placing 1st by splashing in the water.)

2257
01:22:31,168 --> 01:22:32,508
(Haha and So Min escape the race.)

2258
01:22:32,508 --> 01:22:33,779
Yes!

2259
01:22:33,779 --> 01:22:35,279
(after collecting two heart cards.)

2260
01:22:35,809 --> 01:22:37,479
This isn't a scary ride.

2261
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:39,279
This isn't a scary ride. Get on.

2262
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:40,279
Let's go.

2263
01:22:40,279 --> 01:22:41,418
(Chi Yul and Ji Hyo get on the ride.)

2264
01:22:41,418 --> 01:22:42,748
This isn't a scary ride, right?

2265
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:44,889
I don't think it is.

2266
01:22:44,889 --> 01:22:46,088
What should I do?

2267
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:49,328
(This is scary!)

2268
01:22:50,389 --> 01:22:51,928
This is scary.

2269
01:22:52,328 --> 01:22:53,828
It isn't scary.

2270
01:22:53,828 --> 01:22:56,828
(He holds on to Ji Hyo.)

2271
01:22:58,328 --> 01:23:00,269
Why did you hold on to me if it isn't scary?

2272
01:23:00,498 --> 01:23:03,338
I wanted to keep you safe.

2273
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:05,309
I will choose.

2274
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:06,508
(Ji Hyo chooses the briefcase.)

2275
01:23:06,609 --> 01:23:07,609
Okay.

2276
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:11,178
(Only one briefcase has a heart.)

2277
01:23:11,878 --> 01:23:14,449
(Chi Yul and Ji Hyo obtain 1 heart card.)

2278
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:15,918
We did it.

2279
01:23:16,718 --> 01:23:17,849
(Eun Jung, you have to go down this time.)

2280
01:23:17,849 --> 01:23:18,949
Okay. Let's go.

2281
01:23:19,859 --> 01:23:23,229
(This time, Jae Suk and Eun Jung go down the slide together.)

2282
01:23:23,229 --> 01:23:25,998
(Speeding)

2283
01:23:28,059 --> 01:23:31,968
(It's pretty fun.)

2284
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:33,699
It was okay, right?

2285
01:23:33,998 --> 01:23:35,599
- It was nice. - What?

2286
01:23:36,168 --> 01:23:37,708
I think it's this one.

2287
01:23:38,668 --> 01:23:39,708
I don't know.

2288
01:23:40,279 --> 01:23:41,309
It's a heart card.

2289
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,849
(Jae Suk and Eun Jung obtain 1 heart card.)

2290
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:44,849
In 1, 2, 3.

2291
01:23:44,849 --> 01:23:45,878
(Suk Jin and Bora obtain 2 heart cards.)

2292
01:23:45,878 --> 01:23:47,548
We are done. This is incredible.

2293
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:50,218
We are done. Do I take these with me?

2294
01:23:50,418 --> 01:23:52,319
- Pick the one in the middle. - The one in the middle?

2295
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,189
- Pick it up. - The one in the middle?

2296
01:23:54,189 --> 01:23:55,489
In 1, 2, 3.

2297
01:23:55,659 --> 01:23:58,529
(The briefcase in the middle contains a heart card.)

2298
01:23:58,529 --> 01:23:59,859
We have two heart cards.

2299
01:23:59,859 --> 01:24:00,958
You have two heart cards.

2300
01:24:00,958 --> 01:24:02,559
(Jong Kook and Jisoo finish in 3rd place.)

2301
01:24:02,798 --> 01:24:05,168
(There are 4 couples remaining.)

2302
01:24:05,168 --> 01:24:06,798
- You have 1 minute left. - 1 minute? Let's go.

2303
01:24:06,798 --> 01:24:08,538
(Let's get rid of our bomb card.)

2304
01:24:08,538 --> 01:24:09,708
No!

2305
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:11,708
- 1 minute? - We have 1 minute left.

2306
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:12,739
No!

2307
01:24:12,739 --> 01:24:14,178
Let's run.

2308
01:24:14,178 --> 01:24:16,109
- Hold on. - Let's run.

2309
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:18,708
We have to remove Jae Suk's name tag.

2310
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,578
(They are in a hurry.)

2311
01:24:20,878 --> 01:24:22,819
If we go on this ride and get a heart card,

2312
01:24:22,949 --> 01:24:24,149
we will be done.

2313
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:26,258
We have to remove a name tag no matter what.

2314
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:27,458
Come on.

2315
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:30,088
- We can't end the race like this. - No! Let's catch them.

2316
01:24:30,258 --> 01:24:31,288
Come here.

2317
01:24:31,529 --> 01:24:32,559
No, come here.

2318
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:36,328
(Why does it have to be this couple?)

2319
01:24:36,328 --> 01:24:38,729
(The bomb card war resumes.)

2320
01:24:39,868 --> 01:24:41,168
(They must remove a name tag first...)

2321
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:42,399
No!

2322
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:44,569
(to give away the bomb and obtain a blank card.)

2323
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:45,609
No!

2324
01:24:45,609 --> 01:24:49,349
(Kwang Soo's hand grabs Ye Jin's name tag.)

2325
01:24:50,248 --> 01:24:53,319
(Se Chan protects her.)

2326
01:24:53,319 --> 01:24:54,479
Did you get his name tag?

2327
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:57,849
(Jennie has Se Chan's name tag.)

2328
01:24:59,019 --> 01:25:01,319
(While Se Chan was busy protecting Ye Jin,)

2329
01:25:01,319 --> 01:25:03,559
(Jennie removed his name tag.)

2330
01:25:03,689 --> 01:25:05,328
(Jennie is the best.)

2331
01:25:05,328 --> 01:25:06,359
Did you get his name tag?

2332
01:25:06,798 --> 01:25:07,958
My goodness.

2333
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:09,868
(Kwang Soo and Jennie can exchange a card.)

2334
01:25:09,868 --> 01:25:11,298
We get to choose, right?

2335
01:25:11,298 --> 01:25:13,069
- Kwang Soo. - This ends here.

2336
01:25:13,069 --> 01:25:14,569
- It's Ye Jin. - Here,

2337
01:25:14,569 --> 01:25:16,508
one of you will go down.

2338
01:25:17,069 --> 01:25:18,909
- It's Ye Jin. - We can escape.

2339
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:21,979
Let's escape from this pit of bombs.

2340
01:25:22,139 --> 01:25:23,449
Okay. This is our last chance.

2341
01:25:23,449 --> 01:25:24,809
- It's her. - That's right.

2342
01:25:25,248 --> 01:25:26,378
- It's her. - Until the end,

2343
01:25:27,218 --> 01:25:28,449
go with your style.

2344
01:25:28,449 --> 01:25:29,949
- Ye Jin. - Jennie.

2345
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:31,389
(Jennie exchanges her card with Ye Jin's.)

2346
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:32,618
- Shall we exchange it? - Shall we exchange it?

2347
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:33,989
- But... - Okay, Ye Jin.

2348
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:35,059
Okay.

2349
01:25:35,859 --> 01:25:37,189
It's over.

2350
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:38,389
It's over for us.

2351
01:25:38,389 --> 01:25:39,529
(What is Ye Jin's card?)

2352
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:41,958
- This is... - Please.

2353
01:25:41,958 --> 01:25:44,199
- This is... - This is our last chance.

2354
01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:46,269
(If Ye Jin has a blank card, Kwang Soo and Jennie can escape.)

2355
01:25:46,269 --> 01:25:47,338
We are ruined.

2356
01:25:47,338 --> 01:25:48,439
(What does that mean?)

2357
01:25:48,798 --> 01:25:50,139
- This is our last chance. - This is...

2358
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:54,208
(Let's escape from this pit of bombs.)

2359
01:25:55,779 --> 01:25:59,449
(She gets a bomb card for a bomb card.)

2360
01:26:01,349 --> 01:26:03,248
Why is it here, Kwang Soo?

2361
01:26:03,248 --> 01:26:04,548
They saw it.

2362
01:26:04,548 --> 01:26:06,718
We sent it away in the morning.

2363
01:26:06,758 --> 01:26:07,918
They saw it.

2364
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:08,918
We have one bomb card.

2365
01:26:09,328 --> 01:26:10,729
I can't believe them.

2366
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:12,328
(They end up exchanging bomb cards.)

2367
01:26:12,328 --> 01:26:13,758
We removed the name tag.

2368
01:26:13,758 --> 01:26:15,099
(They end up exchanging bomb cards.)

2369
01:26:16,868 --> 01:26:19,868
- The race is over. - Okay.

2370
01:26:20,139 --> 01:26:22,569
The ones who obtained two heart cards first are...

2371
01:26:22,668 --> 01:26:24,269
- Haha and So Min. - Are you serious?

2372
01:26:24,609 --> 01:26:26,578
- No way. - Are you serious?

2373
01:26:26,578 --> 01:26:28,208
Did So Min place first?

2374
01:26:28,208 --> 01:26:30,248
- Are you serious? - Will they get the matching rings?

2375
01:26:30,248 --> 01:26:32,849
(The winners get matching gold rings.)

2376
01:26:32,918 --> 01:26:35,218
The second ones to obtain two heart cards receive...

2377
01:26:35,218 --> 01:26:36,889
a Korean beef set.

2378
01:26:37,088 --> 01:26:38,189
That's our card.

2379
01:26:38,189 --> 01:26:39,889
One of those cards is ours.

2380
01:26:40,088 --> 01:26:41,159
(The Korean beef set is ours.)

2381
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:43,258
- You can take it. - Korean beef!

2382
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:45,729
The third ones to obtain two heart cards receive...

2383
01:26:45,729 --> 01:26:46,928
(Jong Kook and Jisoo place 3rd.)

2384
01:26:46,928 --> 01:26:48,029
red ginseng set.

2385
01:26:48,029 --> 01:26:49,828
Red ginseng.

2386
01:26:49,828 --> 01:26:51,229
(We promise to eat red ginseng and become healthier.)

2387
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:52,569
- Now, - Okay.

2388
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:55,199
- the two problematic teams. - Problematic teams?

2389
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,968
- Don't say that. - Problematic teams?

2390
01:26:57,038 --> 01:26:59,409
Two teams currently carry bombs.

2391
01:26:59,409 --> 01:27:01,538
- Problematic teams? - We haven't caused trouble.

2392
01:27:01,838 --> 01:27:04,279
We worked hard all day.

2393
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:07,849
Se Chan and Ye Jin couple...

2394
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:10,489
and Kwang Soo and Jennie couple each have a bomb.

2395
01:27:10,489 --> 01:27:11,949
We will now have the final deathmatch.

2396
01:27:11,949 --> 01:27:14,218
(The final deathmatch)

2397
01:27:14,218 --> 01:27:17,229
You will sit at a table and mix the briefcases well.

2398
01:27:17,229 --> 01:27:18,489
Then you will exchange the briefcases.

2399
01:27:18,489 --> 01:27:20,729
The team that gets two bombs will lose...

2400
01:27:20,729 --> 01:27:22,399
and receive a penalty.

2401
01:27:25,729 --> 01:27:26,838
Are you ready?

2402
01:27:26,838 --> 01:27:27,939
(The deathmatch requires luck and intelligence.)

2403
01:27:27,939 --> 01:27:29,439
It's a psychological game. Who should go first?

2404
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:31,208
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2405
01:27:31,208 --> 01:27:33,739
The winning team will have a chance to choose.

2406
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:35,739
- The winning team gets to choose. - Yes.

2407
01:27:35,739 --> 01:27:37,708
- Okay. Let's go. - Rock-paper-scissors

2408
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:38,779
Jennie.

2409
01:27:38,779 --> 01:27:40,149
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2410
01:27:40,149 --> 01:27:43,349
(Between Jennie and Ye Jin, who is fated to choose?)

2411
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:45,489
(Ye Jin wins.)

2412
01:27:45,489 --> 01:27:46,788
- Okay. Good job. - Oh, yes!

2413
01:27:47,418 --> 01:27:48,588
(I am sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2414
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:49,889
- Jennie. - We have to choose carefully.

2415
01:27:49,989 --> 01:27:51,328
Seriously.

2416
01:27:51,328 --> 01:27:52,798
- This is driving me crazy. - You know,

2417
01:27:52,798 --> 01:27:54,559
Jennie is really unlucky.

2418
01:27:54,559 --> 01:27:55,859
- You know, - Jennie is...

2419
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,968
she is the unluckiest guest I have ever met.

2420
01:27:57,968 --> 01:27:59,298
She is really unlucky.

2421
01:27:59,298 --> 01:28:01,399
Despite that, she keeps trying to do things.

2422
01:28:02,298 --> 01:28:05,309
- Unlucky people are like that. - You are right.

2423
01:28:05,309 --> 01:28:06,508
They like to take the lead.

2424
01:28:06,508 --> 01:28:07,508
My goodness.

2425
01:28:07,508 --> 01:28:10,378
And for some reason, we feel like we'll strike gold this time.

2426
01:28:10,378 --> 01:28:12,609
- That's right. - It won't happen at the end.

2427
01:28:12,609 --> 01:28:15,178
- We won't be last. I promise. - Unlucky ones always try to lead.

2428
01:28:15,178 --> 01:28:16,689
- That's right. - Let's get started.

2429
01:28:16,689 --> 01:28:17,989
- Pick one. - Good luck.

2430
01:28:17,989 --> 01:28:19,248
- Choose one for me. - What if...

2431
01:28:19,788 --> 01:28:22,618
(A butterfly lands on his glasses.)

2432
01:28:26,258 --> 01:28:27,399
(Screaming)

2433
01:28:27,399 --> 01:28:28,599
Hey, you coward!

2434
01:28:28,599 --> 01:28:31,368
(Screaming)

2435
01:28:32,199 --> 01:28:34,168
(No, save me!)

2436
01:28:34,599 --> 01:28:36,468
- It's just a butterfly! - It's over.

2437
01:28:36,508 --> 01:28:38,739
Jennie, you're okay. It's all right.

2438
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,609
- You're okay, Jennie. - The butterfly landed on you.

2439
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:43,409
It was just a small butterfly.

2440
01:28:43,409 --> 01:28:46,218
- It startled me. It hit my face. - It was a butterfly.

2441
01:28:46,218 --> 01:28:47,649
- No, no. - Hey, right now...

2442
01:28:47,779 --> 01:28:51,088
By the way, Jennie is a new...

2443
01:28:51,088 --> 01:28:53,059
- addition to the unlucky ones. - That's right.

2444
01:28:53,059 --> 01:28:54,788
She does fit in with you guys.

2445
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:57,258
- She easily gets scared too. - No pretty women were this unlucky.

2446
01:28:57,628 --> 01:29:00,599
- It's my first time seeing one. - It's a rare mix. It is rare.

2447
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:02,968
- Seriously. - Exactly.

2448
01:29:02,968 --> 01:29:04,328
- Can we choose ours? - Yes.

2449
01:29:04,328 --> 01:29:07,099
Will you choose, Se Chan? Or will you let the other team pick?

2450
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:08,338
- It's your decision. - Make them choose.

2451
01:29:08,338 --> 01:29:10,309
- We'll make them choose. - Yes, that's better.

2452
01:29:10,309 --> 01:29:11,769
They have the worst luck.

2453
01:29:11,769 --> 01:29:14,538
- You should choose, Jennie. - Do I need one without the bombs?

2454
01:29:14,538 --> 01:29:15,708
Yes, of course.

2455
01:29:16,178 --> 01:29:18,578
This one.

2456
01:29:18,878 --> 01:29:20,449
- Okay. - Then which one do we get?

2457
01:29:20,449 --> 01:29:21,949
(She chooses Ye Jin's without any hesitation.)

2458
01:29:21,949 --> 01:29:23,949
- All right. - Which one will you switch with?

2459
01:29:24,618 --> 01:29:26,319
- Is it done? - No.

2460
01:29:26,489 --> 01:29:28,458
We'll choose Se Chan's.

2461
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:30,258
(The winning strategy is to pick the one she didn't pick.)

2462
01:29:30,258 --> 01:29:31,328
- Kwang Soo. - Jennie already chose.

2463
01:29:31,328 --> 01:29:34,599
- It's because she chose it. - Trust me on this.

2464
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:36,729
- Yes, trust her. - I don't think we'll be last.

2465
01:29:36,729 --> 01:29:40,099
Let's just go with Se Chan's this time. What do you think? No?

2466
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:41,939
(Shaking her head)

2467
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:46,678
- I think this is the one. - Gosh, she's stubborn too.

2468
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:49,849
- I have no control over this game. - By the way,

2469
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:51,449
- She's unlucky and stubborn. - That's how unlucky people are.

2470
01:29:51,449 --> 01:29:54,178
She chose the briefcase with the bomb card to begin with.

2471
01:29:54,178 --> 01:29:55,578
- All right. - I'll open it.

2472
01:29:55,718 --> 01:29:57,889
- What could this be? - I can just...

2473
01:29:57,889 --> 01:30:04,059
(Is there a bomb card in Ye Jin's bag which Jennie was certain of?)

2474
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:08,798
- Hey, darn it! - Okay!

2475
01:30:08,798 --> 01:30:10,798
(Hey, what is this?)

2476
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:13,998
- Okay! - Yes!

2477
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:17,769
- Let me see. - Did she really pick that one?

2478
01:30:17,769 --> 01:30:19,508
(You have my respect, Jennie.)

2479
01:30:19,508 --> 01:30:21,878
- Jennie. You're truly... - No way.

2480
01:30:21,878 --> 01:30:24,708
- You should join our club. - This is unbelievable.

2481
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,418
- No, don't shake my hands! - We hold regular meetings.

2482
01:30:27,418 --> 01:30:29,389
- We have regular meetings. - Come to our meetings.

2483
01:30:29,389 --> 01:30:32,548
- This is incredible. - You'll be a regular member.

2484
01:30:32,548 --> 01:30:36,189
- That's not it. - Kwang Soo and Jennie lost.

2485
01:30:36,189 --> 01:30:40,059
(The unlucky couple, Kwang Soo and Jennie, will face the penalty.)

2486
01:30:40,298 --> 01:30:43,328
Tell you what. It rained today.

2487
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,868
I was concerned that we were filming at a waterpark.

2488
01:30:46,069 --> 01:30:48,168
- But it's better on rainy days. - It was quite nice.

2489
01:30:48,168 --> 01:30:49,609
- It was fun. - It was nice.

2490
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:51,168
- We should come on rainy days. - Right.

2491
01:30:51,168 --> 01:30:54,809
Kwang Soo and Jennie will face the last penalty.

2492
01:30:55,078 --> 01:30:57,409
- Get ready. Start. - Be careful.

2493
01:30:58,309 --> 01:31:01,519
(All the water bombs are thrown to Kwang Soo.)

2494
01:31:03,048 --> 01:31:04,689
(It hits his face.)

2495
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:05,819
Wait. Time-out.

2496
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:09,088
- That must hurt. - Wait, hold on!

2497
01:31:09,088 --> 01:31:11,828
- I can't throw it. - That must hurt a lot.

2498
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,599
(Who could be the cause of this disaster?)

2499
01:31:16,699 --> 01:31:18,729
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

2500
01:31:18,729 --> 01:31:21,038
- Good work. - Good job, everyone.
