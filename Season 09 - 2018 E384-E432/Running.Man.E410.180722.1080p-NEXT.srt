1
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:09,070
(A day before the shoot, at a movie theater in Seoul)

2
00:00:09,079 --> 00:00:11,140
(The members are entering the rented, empty theater.)

3
00:00:11,147 --> 00:00:12,780
Jae Suk, how much money did you spend?

4
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:15,080
(What? Only Jae Suk, So Min, and Se Chan are coming in?)

5
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:16,750
- Jae Suk, is this a surprise? - Did you rent the whole place?

6
00:00:16,753 --> 00:00:18,535
- This must be a surprise event. - My gosh.

7
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:21,705
Even if I had to rent a place, I wouldn't rent this big place.

8
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:23,660
This place is huge.

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,760
(Why did only these three members come to the theater?)

10
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:26,890
This is nice.

11
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,430
- Se Chan, is this a surprise? - Yes?

12
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:30,360
Yes, it is. You'll see a video message soon.

13
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:32,215
Kwang Soo will pop up and say, "So Min".

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,945
- "Have you been well?" - Then I'm going to leave.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,840
- I'm really going to leave. Yes. - If Kwang Soo shows up?

16
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:39,900
(Kwang Soo's surprise event makes him cringe.)

17
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:42,125
- He might suddenly start singing. - Right, he'll sing too.

18
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,040
You all know who's joining Running Man, right?

19
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:46,140
- Yes. - Of course.

20
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,325
Is he going to come out in the middle of the movie?

21
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,565
- No, he wouldn't. - Right, no. Gosh, you surprised me.

22
00:00:50,787 --> 00:00:52,220
(The door opens)

23
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:55,020
- "Hey, So Min." - What are you talking about?

24
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:56,020
(Is this Tom's surprise for her?)

25
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:59,460
- "Hey, So Min." - Tom can't be here right now.

26
00:00:59,462 --> 00:01:02,905
- Right? - Tom doesn't even know who you are.

27
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,630
- He probably doesn't know us. - That's right.

28
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:07,245
Obviously.

29
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,870
Everyone, we've asked you to come in for a reason.

30
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:14,210
This week's race is called Catch the Spy.

31
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,525
- Catch who? - It's Catch the Spy.

32
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:21,480
You've been instructed by M Agency, the best intelligence agency.

33
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:23,620
You have infiltrated into R Agency...

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,980
and will be secretly carrying out missions.

35
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:29,220
- We're spies. - In a nutshell, you're the spies.

36
00:01:29,225 --> 00:01:31,320
- This is so cool. - Gosh, it's definitely doomed.

37
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:33,860
(It's definitely doomed.)

38
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:36,090
Whenever So Min is the spy, that episode gets ruined.

39
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,930
She has never succeeded when she was a spy.

40
00:01:39,936 --> 00:01:41,270
She's already trembling.

41
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,900
- Se Chan barely succeeded once. - Right. I got the last one.

42
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,040
- That's right. - Right.

43
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,970
You need to show us a success case.

44
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:50,710
The writer said that I'm the female version of Suk Jin.

45
00:01:50,714 --> 00:01:53,495
- The producer said the same thing. - Female version of Suk Jin.

46
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,280
- Gosh. - We're in trouble.

47
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:58,880
But you gave me the dumb members.

48
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,020
(Dumb members)

49
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:03,790
- My gosh. Seriously? - Hey. That's not true.

50
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:05,460
- What are you babbling about? - We can make this work.

51
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:07,160
- Or they're the ugly members. - No.

52
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:08,760
(Let me introduce my ugly friends.)

53
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,160
That's not true.

54
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:15,215
We'll hand over the mission your superior in M Agency sent.

55
00:02:16,206 --> 00:02:19,200
Dear proud members of M Agency. Have you been well?

56
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,210
What's going on?

57
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,285
(Who's our superior that's giving us this mission?)

58
00:02:23,346 --> 00:02:24,580
- It's Tom. - Gosh.

59
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,695
(It's Tom.)

60
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:32,495
(The superior that they will have a rendezvous with tomorrow is Tom.)

61
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,960
It's been a while since you guys infiltrated our rivalry, R Agency.

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,635
How is your mission coming along?

63
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:41,930
A while ago, we received a tip that...

64
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:45,775
the head of R Agency is making moves to target M Agency.

65
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:50,415
Eliminate this mysterious leader of R Agency and keep M Agency safe.

66
00:02:51,107 --> 00:02:54,840
In order to support you guys, we'll be heading over to Korea.

67
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:59,395
(Tom and his friends will be coming to Running Man to help.)

68
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:03,620
Your mission is to conceal your identities until the final mission,

69
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,120
fish out the leader of R Agency, and eliminate the individual.

70
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:09,090
(Their mission is to conceal their identities and remove the leader.)

71
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,860
You must stop members from getting clues about the spies.

72
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:15,660
And you must acquire hints about the leader of R Agency.

73
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,660
At the end of the voting, if two of you survive or eliminate the leader,

74
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,030
it will be your victory.

75
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,830
- They're going to vote. - This is bad.

76
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:24,940
But I get the feeling Jong Kook might be the leader.

77
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,270
- No, no. It won't be him. - Really?

78
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:30,895
If they choose Jong Kook, they'll be uncomfortable too.

79
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:34,380
The moment he becomes the leader, it'd be suffocating.

80
00:03:34,384 --> 00:03:36,610
It will be a lot of pressure, so it won't be Jong Kook.

81
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:38,020
(That's why he won't be the leader.)

82
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,680
- You know what I mean, right? - I know what you mean.

83
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:42,520
- It's suffocating. - His subordinates will suffocate.

84
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:45,035
Gosh, he's no joke. Let's catch the leader of R Agency.

85
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:49,390
(The next day at 4am, at a cafe in Seoul)

86
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,830
Hello. Hi.

87
00:03:50,834 --> 00:03:52,530
- Hello. - Nice to see you again.

88
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:54,585
- Hello. - Nice to see you.

89
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:56,345
Where is Tom?

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,900
- Where is Tom? - Where's Tom?

91
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:00,570
Where is Tom Cruise?

92
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:03,210
- Hey, do you think Mr. Cruise... - We came to a coffee shop.

93
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,940
- would be here at this time? - Hey, look at the time.

94
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,110
The fact that we're here...

95
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,150
means that we are working around his schedule.

96
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,835
(It means that we're accommodating to Tom's schedule.)

97
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
- We'll be filming to meet him. - That's right.

98
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:16,420
- We'll meet when he's feeling good. - Of course.

99
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:18,360
(Thank you for being so considerate.)

100
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:21,390
- It's hectic on cable networks. - Yes, indeed.

101
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,260
- All of his movies are being aired. - Right.

102
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:26,300
- All of his movies were on it. - His movies were released again.

103
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:29,285
- He hasn't changed at all. - Tom Cruise from "Top Gun".

104
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,440
- Gosh. - We'll get to see him in person.

105
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:34,440
- Have you seen "Top Gun"? - Yes, I have.

106
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:36,240
- I saw it when I was young. - Really?

107
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,240
- Really? - Kwang Soo...

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,880
(A nostalgic melody)

109
00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:44,550
(Humming)

110
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:45,820
Tom Cruise

111
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:47,750
(Tom Cruise)

112
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:49,490
(He knows only half of the melody.)

113
00:04:49,492 --> 00:04:51,205
- You did watch it. - I did.

114
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:53,320
(Humming)

115
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,330
Right. My gosh.

116
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,560
- Suk Jin, he made it funny. Stop. - Tom Cruise

117
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:58,830
- He already did that. - He...

118
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:01,370
- I was just adding a few spices. - He already made it funny.

119
00:05:01,371 --> 00:05:03,330
- I was just adding... - Why would you take that from him?

120
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,640
- I was just improving it. - You're standing far from him.

121
00:05:05,642 --> 00:05:08,640
- Let Kwang Soo take the glory. - Exactly.

122
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:11,080
(You little...)

123
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,740
- What are you doing? - Do you want to get beat up?

124
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:14,810
(Boiling with anger)

125
00:05:14,817 --> 00:05:17,380
- Suk Jin is really angry. He's mad. - Goodness, come on.

126
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:20,180
- I can't believe you. - That's no way to speak on TV.

127
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,120
Hey, you. Actually, I don't even know how powerful my punch is.

128
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,535
(Actually, I don't even know how powerful my punch is.)

129
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,560
- I've never had to use it. - He doesn't know.

130
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:30,275
- He's never punched someone. - Suk Jin.

131
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,260
Suk Jin. Don't be shocked if I lick your punch when you punch me.

132
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:35,545
(Because it will be sweet.)

133
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,570
- It will be really sweet. - It will be sweet.

134
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:40,200
- Oh, sweet. Gosh, it's so sweet. - Hey.

135
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,370
- Give me a punch. - It's so sweet.

136
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:44,740
- Suyu-ri's Honey Punch. - Give me one more.

137
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:48,025
- His punch is as sweet as honey. - Suyu-ri's Honey Punch.

138
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:50,735
- That will be sweet. - Spread it on bread and eat.

139
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,620
I heard that Henry Cavill is joining too.

140
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:54,320
- Superman. - Superman.

141
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:56,890
- That's right. - Did he play Superman?

142
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,190
- Superman. - Simon Pegg?

143
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,330
Simon's character helps him...

144
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:05,415
- from the headquarters in secret. - Right. He worked with computers.

145
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:08,370
As you already know,

146
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:12,140
today's race will be Catch the Spy with these famous stars.

147
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:14,785
- Catch the Spy? - Spy?

148
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:18,725
You're agents from the best intelligence agency, R Agency.

149
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:20,680
- It's been a while. - We haven't done this for a while.

150
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,510
- I'm getting into the role. - R Agency?

151
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,020
However, among the eight of you,

152
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:29,290
there are three double agents who secretly infiltrated from M Agency,

153
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:32,060
- rival agency for their missions. - Three double agents?

154
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,130
- And there is... - Three?

155
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,245
a leader of R Agency.

156
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:39,930
After three missions, the winners will be given clues...

157
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:42,270
about the spies or the leader of R Agency.

158
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:46,240
R Agency wins if 2 of the 3 spies are chosen by votes at the end.

159
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:49,240
However, if R Agency's leader is voted among the three,

160
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,810
M Agency wins.

161
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:53,295
The winning team will be given the gold badges.

162
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,095
Does it mean that all of us belong to R Agency?

163
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:59,635
- Three of you are from M Agency. - M Agency.

164
00:06:59,756 --> 00:07:01,390
One of us is R Agency's leader.

165
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,905
Does the individual know he or she is the leader?

166
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,760
- M Agency... - Do they know their identities?

167
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:07,475
- Did you tell them? - They know their identities.

168
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:11,275
Goodness, everyone is acting now.

169
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:15,570
Hold on. I came 30 minutes before the shoot,

170
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:18,000
but Se Chan was completely ready for the shoot.

171
00:07:18,007 --> 00:07:19,070
- Me? - Yes.

172
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:22,025
- We should share information. - I always come in my outfit.

173
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:24,740
- Se Chan... - I always come in my outfit.

174
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:26,010
- From where? From home? - Yes.

175
00:07:26,015 --> 00:07:28,880
- Is that so? Turn around. - Okay.

176
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,525
Your suit doesn't have creases.

177
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:32,580
- I didn't have my jacket on. - Did you take it off then?

178
00:07:32,588 --> 00:07:34,490
Come on. Why are you doing this? We just started.

179
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,990
- Come on. - This isn't how you play it.

180
00:07:35,992 --> 00:07:38,120
- You don't play it like this. - Do it later. Later.

181
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:39,705
- What are you doing? - We just had the opening segment.

182
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:41,845
- No, it's not that. - He already started.

183
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:44,000
He's trying to finish the race in the opening segment.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,430
Jong Kook, the sun didn't even rise yet.

185
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:47,130
- We need to get hints too. - I couldn't sleep.

186
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:49,630
No, it's not that. I couldn't sleep.

187
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,640
I went to bed after watching "Sherlock Holmes".

188
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,310
- I went to sleep after watching it. - All of a sudden,

189
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,740
I broke out in a cold sweat.

190
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:58,795
(The race could've been over even before meeting Tom.)

191
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:02,310
At the final mission, M Agency's senior agents,

192
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:05,165
Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, and Simon Pegg...

193
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:09,535
- are waiting to help their agents. - Is that so?

194
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,475
I can't believe this.

195
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,930
For your information, the senior agents...

196
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,930
know who the three double agents are among you.

197
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:18,900
(They know the identities of 3 double agents from M Agency.)

198
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,700
- They already know? - They saw the photos in advance.

199
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:23,070
- They know our names? - They know our faces.

200
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:24,655
- Do they really know our names? - My gosh.

201
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:27,525
Please do your best to win this mission.

202
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:29,240
At the end of show, I hope...

203
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:30,740
it ends with Tom getting a stick slap from Jong Kook.

204
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,950
(I hope it ends with Tom getting a stick slap from Jong Kook.)

205
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,250
He's one of us now.

206
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,450
- We'll be close friends. - My gosh.

207
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:38,895
- I wish I could give him a slap. - We should make good memories.

208
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,450
He would be so shocked.

209
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:42,790
You must be hungry since you came in early in the morning.

210
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:44,060
- Yes. - Yes.

211
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
The mission where the first hint is at stake...

212
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:48,645
is called Sounds of Breakfast.

213
00:08:49,732 --> 00:08:51,700
- Sounds of Breakfast? - We have to guess by the sounds.

214
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,930
(Do we need to whisper?)

215
00:08:52,935 --> 00:08:55,230
Break into 4 teams of 2 freely.

216
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,340
Each team will choose a dish for their breakfast...

217
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,485
and quietly eat their breakfast for five minutes.

218
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:04,055
You must eat at least one bite of every dish on the tray.

219
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:08,180
If you make sounds louder than 60dB,

220
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:10,480
you will be punished with the squeaky hammer.

221
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:11,680
(Sounds over 60dB mean the squeaky hammer.)

222
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:15,505
(In other words, they must eat without making any sounds.)

223
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,460
The team with the lowest number of hits will win.

224
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:21,745
Only a member of the winning team will get the hint he or she wants.

225
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:24,530
- All right. Let's choose. - Should we start?

226
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:25,700
(They'll choose teams with the spoons.)

227
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,275
Gosh, this is important. It's important.

228
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,200
Kwang Soo will go first.

229
00:09:29,205 --> 00:09:30,545
- I... - Okay.

230
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:31,970
We're breaking into two teams, right?

231
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,200
- I got yellow. - I see.

232
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,070
You'll team up with Suk Jin.

233
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:37,310
- Gosh. - You'll team up with Suk Jin.

234
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:39,410
(He lets out a deep and sincere sigh.)

235
00:09:39,415 --> 00:09:41,310
- You're happy, right? - Kwang Soo, don't make it obvious.

236
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,080
- I'm sorry. - Why did you...

237
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,680
- Next up is Se Chan. - I...

238
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,065
- chose blue. - Gosh.

239
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,590
Okay.

240
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,650
- Who has red? - What?

241
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:50,305
- Hey, Jong Kook. - Wait.

242
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,860
(Only two people remain. That means...)

243
00:09:52,862 --> 00:09:54,460
(Jae Suk and So Min make a team.)

244
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,560
- What's going on? - How is this possible?

245
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,930
- They always partner up. - They're like magnets.

246
00:09:58,935 --> 00:10:00,300
- Gosh, the frog. - You're meant to be.

247
00:10:00,303 --> 00:10:02,700
- They meet again like fate. - This is so meant to be.

248
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,600
There are four dishes you can choose from for breakfast.

249
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:08,940
A cutlet set, a snack set, a snack bar food set, and a clattering set.

250
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,410
- The cutlet set is the best. - The cutlet is the best.

251
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,910
- We have to slice it. It's noisy. - The cutlet set.

252
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,295
(A cutlet set, a snack set, a snack bar food set, and a clattering set)

253
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,910
Jong Kook, let's win this.

254
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,580
(The breakfast dishes and the order)

255
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:21,050
The clattering set comes with bibimbap, whole radish kimchi,

256
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,450
- and the coffee with an egg. - The kimchi will end them.

257
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,560
I'm sorry to interrupt,

258
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:28,460
but why are there five people behind Jong Kook?

259
00:10:28,464 --> 00:10:29,690
Ji Hyo is playing it too.

260
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,030
- Is this a festival for you? - Why?

261
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,430
No, it just happened. It just happened this way.

262
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:35,415
- I love these kinds of games. - We can hit him legally.

263
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,115
Gosh, I should exercise my neck.

264
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:39,470
- Bring it in. - Should I cover Ji Hyo then?

265
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:41,425
Besides, they have to mix the rice.

266
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,610
- That looks good. - It looks delicious.

267
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,110
- They added the sesame oil. - What's that?

268
00:10:45,114 --> 00:10:46,380
- That's coffee. - They have to drink coffee too?

269
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:47,680
You have five minutes.

270
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,180
- The young radish kimchi is big. - Get ready.

271
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,180
We have five minutes?

272
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:52,065
- We'll give you five minutes. - Get ready.

273
00:10:52,188 --> 00:10:53,650
Start.

274
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:54,820
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo start.)

275
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:59,805
(Because of the air conditioner, it's louder on the right side.)

276
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:04,075
(She carefully adds the vegetables into the bowl.)

277
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:08,415
(Good job, Ji Hyo. We had a good start.)

278
00:11:08,938 --> 00:11:11,415
(Getting their hammers ready)

279
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,925
(Ji Hyo: Let me lift the spoon.)

280
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:19,395
(They're utterly nervous. She carefully lifts it.)

281
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:25,580
(Please go over 60dB.)

282
00:11:25,588 --> 00:11:26,580
(Clattering)

283
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:27,805
(Hammering)

284
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,505
(It went over 60dB. It's a shower of squeaky hammers.)

285
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,405
(I hit Jong Kook.)

286
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:35,360
(Jong Kook: The spoons are stuck together.)

287
00:11:35,364 --> 00:11:38,100
(He struggles while making a face.)

288
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,775
(It's so hard to eat a meal.)

289
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:43,545
(It's time to mix it after adding gochujang.)

290
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,670
(It will go over 60dB. They're going to mix it.)

291
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,925
(They're mixing it.)

292
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:53,295
(They manage to add gochujang quietly for now.)

293
00:11:53,316 --> 00:11:56,165
(Please make a noise. They're fully ready.)

294
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:59,035
(He adds it quietly.)

295
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,905
(They manage to mix it quietly just like the best members.)

296
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,275
(They're good. How disappointing.)

297
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,905
(The only thing left for them to do is eat.)

298
00:12:09,231 --> 00:12:13,745
(He quietly finishes the egg in one bite.)

299
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,400
He's only eating the whites of the egg even during this game.

300
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:19,615
(He's unbelievable.)

301
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:21,310
I got the goosebumps.

302
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,040
(Jong Kook's love for protein is unyielding.)

303
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:25,155
(He finishes absorbing his protein.)

304
00:12:26,115 --> 00:12:28,665
Eat the kimchi. Eat the young radish kimchi.

305
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,665
It will definitely go over 60dB at once.

306
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:33,335
It's impossible not to.

307
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,905
(It's hard to eat it without making a sound. Can he succeed?)

308
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,505
(As they get ready, they're getting their hopes up.)

309
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:49,985
(He tries to eat the kimchi. Well, let me see.)

310
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,915
(Everyone is having a blast. What are you looking at?)

311
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,125
(Flinching)

312
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:59,125
(So Min: I didn't look at you.)

313
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,280
(He finally takes a bite.)

314
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:09,365
(Even if he bites into it, it's lower than 60dB.)

315
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,190
(He bit the radish. How is this possible?)

316
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:13,535
He didn't make any sounds.

317
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,330
(Who on earth is this man?)

318
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:18,660
(Who could he possibly be?)

319
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,100
He's good at eating without making sounds.

320
00:13:20,102 --> 00:13:21,200
He's not making any sounds.

321
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,070
- This is annoying. - Look at that.

322
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,485
(He made a sound.)

323
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:27,540
(He was eating without making any sounds.)

324
00:13:27,543 --> 00:13:29,570
(He suddenly chokes on the food.)

325
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,655
(It's time! It's a festival of squeaky hammers.)

326
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:36,125
(Everyone is excited at the chance to hit him under a proper reason.)

327
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:39,435
(A series of hammering)

328
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:41,090
(Kwang Soo is especially doing his best.)

329
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,805
Stop. That's enough.

330
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,920
- Just hit him once. - That was Kwang Soo.

331
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,320
- It was 100dB. - He has a lot pent up inside.

332
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:47,560
The number skyrocketed.

333
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:50,090
- You hit him too many times. - It was all Kwang Soo.

334
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:52,545
- You beat him up. - No, the number was too high.

335
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,285
- It was 100dB. - Kwang Soo, you're in trouble.

336
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:57,915
Ji Hyo, drink the coffee.

337
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:01,210
(This time, they try making the instant coffee.)

338
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,025
(She pours the water first.)

339
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:07,850
(Hammering)

340
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,795
(He chokes again after getting a hit.)

341
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,820
(As soon as he chokes,)

342
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:14,720
(they keep hitting him with the hammers.)

343
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,020
(Jong Kook: Is it you again, Kwang Soo?)

344
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:18,375
It's because...

345
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:20,190
it went over 100dB.

346
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:21,445
(He's brazen.)

347
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,945
(I'm going to move over there.)

348
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,430
(I'm going to go too.)

349
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:30,470
- I think Jong Kook is really angry. - It wasn't me. It really wasn't.

350
00:14:30,473 --> 00:14:31,900
You've gone mad.

351
00:14:31,907 --> 00:14:33,770
- Kwang Soo, just hit him once. - Hit him once.

352
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:35,340
No, it wasn't me. He kept...

353
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,255
(In the midst of this, he keeps coughing.)

354
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,155
(What's wrong with my throat?)

355
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,995
I didn't do it. I didn't.

356
00:14:43,486 --> 00:14:45,150
(Ji Hyo: Have some water.)

357
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:46,865
(Jong Kook: You're the best.)

358
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:49,035
(You have to pour the coffee mix.)

359
00:14:50,326 --> 00:14:52,790
(Ji Hyo: 1 coffee mix, 1 spoon of cream, and 1 spoon of sugar?)

360
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:54,905
(Again? He coughs again.)

361
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,505
(What a surprise! He hammers Jong Kook like a mad man.)

362
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,615
(Gosh, am I allergic to the young radish kimchi?)

363
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:02,815
(Jong Kook, here you go.)

364
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,915
(You might need this. So Min hands the hammer over.)

365
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:07,040
(Use it well.)

366
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:08,655
(Thank you, So Min.)

367
00:15:08,911 --> 00:15:11,655
(You're not going to use it on me, right?)

368
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:16,810
(She tries having a sip of the coffee at last.)

369
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,535
(It didn't go over 60dB.)

370
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,090
(Amazing. It was so close!)

371
00:15:23,092 --> 00:15:24,435
It was 59.7dB.

372
00:15:25,027 --> 00:15:27,635
(Gosh, Ji Hyo is incredible.)

373
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:32,415
(Their 5 minutes to have breakfast finally are over.)

374
00:15:33,402 --> 00:15:35,870
(It's already over?)

375
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:38,340
If Jong Kook didn't cough, he probably didn't get any hits.

376
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,255
- If he didn't cough... - It went down the wrong pipe.

377
00:15:40,776 --> 00:15:41,970
If he didn't cough, he wouldn't have gotten any.

378
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,770
When he was chewing, he didn't make any sounds.

379
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:46,680
- Kwang Soo went over the line. - Right. You hit him a lot.

380
00:15:46,682 --> 00:15:49,080
- Aren't we supposed to hit once? - He kept hitting Jong Kook.

381
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,850
By the way, you went too far.

382
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:52,520
- Pardon? - I thought we weren't on TV.

383
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:53,950
- Seriously. - You can hit only once.

384
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:56,020
- Anyway, let's continue. - When did you move there?

385
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:57,090
- It's us. - Next up are...

386
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,905
- Kwang Soo and Suk Jin. - Yes.

387
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,530
- You got the snack bar food set. - Gosh, it will be delicious.

388
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,030
We chose a good one.

389
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:05,830
Jong Kook has already found his spot.

390
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,570
(The spot next to Kwang Soo is mine.)

391
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,645
I'm sure it's a coincidence. I'm sure it is.

392
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:10,830
Yes, probably.

393
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,285
(Is it a coincidence?)

394
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:15,055
(He cleans the squeaky hammer for Kwang Soo.)

395
00:16:15,477 --> 00:16:16,540
(Turning ghastly pale)

396
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:18,110
Gosh, it's going to hurt. It will hurt.

397
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,680
- Gosh, that. - That ramyeon is spicy.

398
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:20,950
(The stir-fried noodles are spicy.)

399
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,550
- That looks good. - I can't eat spicy ramyeon.

400
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:25,050
- They have the spicy ramyeon. - Gosh, that ramyeon.

401
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,280
- When they unwrap the gimbap... - Suk Jin, let's do well.

402
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:29,290
- I won't let them hit me. - Get ready.

403
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,765
- Start. - Start.

404
00:16:31,227 --> 00:16:34,675
(Seok Jin: Should I get the spoon first?)

405
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:37,560
(Clattering)

406
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,545
(Hammering)

407
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:42,830
(He smashes down with the edge of the hammer.)

408
00:16:42,838 --> 00:16:45,255
(He's confused.)

409
00:16:45,274 --> 00:16:46,300
I heard a sound.

410
00:16:46,308 --> 00:16:47,515
(My ear is ringing.)

411
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:50,285
(You're not allowed to talk.)

412
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,695
(Be quiet. Let's eat.)

413
00:16:54,683 --> 00:16:57,195
(Go ahead and eat.)

414
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:00,265
(He takes a bite of udon.)

415
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,920
(Slurping)

416
00:17:03,926 --> 00:17:05,435
(He barely makes it.)

417
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,375
(Suk Jin is doing quite well.)

418
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,545
(Kwang Soo takes a bite of udon.)

419
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:14,830
(Slurping)

420
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,715
(He gets hit.)

421
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,285
(He gets hit hard.)

422
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:21,370
Is someone hitting with something harder than a squeaky hammer?

423
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,585
I don't know.

424
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:24,640
(It sounds as hard as a hammer.)

425
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,210
(He keeps being too loud.)

426
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,580
(Punching)

427
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:29,995
(He's loud again.)

428
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,150
It's the sound of the squeaky hammer.

429
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:36,305
(That's what's going over 60dB.)

430
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,560
- It sounds very loud. - Wait a minute.

431
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:40,820
When he hits...

432
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:42,260
Will I get hit forever?

433
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:44,560
- Listen. - It detects whenever he hits me.

434
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,100
I look at this only.

435
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:48,100
I don't look at anything else.

436
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,530
It's the echo of the sound when he hits with his squeaky hammer.

437
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,170
The number goes up because of the echo.

438
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,470
- That's right. - Really?

439
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:57,040
After I hit him, it's 60 again.

440
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,610
- After I hit him, it's 60 again. - What's that?

441
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:00,040
It keeps going.

442
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,380
- It's the echo. - I'm sorry.

443
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:04,535
I didn't understand how the machine worked. I'm sorry.

444
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,135
(Fine, I'll hold my anger.)

445
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,990
(Suk Jin tries some spicy stir-fried noodles.)

446
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:13,960
(It's coming.)

447
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:15,375
(Squeaking)

448
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,275
(It's more painful in his mouth.)

449
00:18:18,334 --> 00:18:20,345
(Have some juice if it's too spicy.)

450
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:23,830
(It's so spicy.)

451
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,900
(He breathes out heavily.)

452
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:26,440
(He breathes out again.)

453
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:27,615
(It's so spicy.)

454
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,070
What's going on?

455
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:30,810
- He keeps being loud. - Hey.

456
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:31,980
You misunderstood.

457
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,195
(What are you doing?)

458
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:35,980
He keeps breathing heavily because it's so spicy.

459
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,280
You just wait and see.

460
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:38,550
I'm serious.

461
00:18:38,554 --> 00:18:40,435
It's because it's too spicy for him.

462
00:18:40,823 --> 00:18:42,320
It's the echo of the squeaky hammer.

463
00:18:42,324 --> 00:18:43,920
No it isn't.

464
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,490
I'll hit you while I'm yelling.

465
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:46,960
No, it's the rule.

466
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:49,560
- No, I heard it clearly. - Ji Hyo.

467
00:18:49,565 --> 00:18:50,890
I do it accurately.

468
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,445
Start.

469
00:18:53,035 --> 00:18:56,715
(He removes the foil from the gimbap.)

470
00:18:57,673 --> 00:19:00,270
(Crackling)

471
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:01,625
(Squeaking)

472
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,125
(We got hit so much, it doesn't even hurt anymore.)

473
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,595
(Shall I take out some gimbap?)

474
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,220
(Hey, Kwang Soo.)

475
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,935
(This gimbap is strange.)

476
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,520
(Kwang Soo says...)

477
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:16,905
Why isn't it cut?

478
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,460
(Why isn't the gimbap cut?)

479
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:20,775
(Why are you talking?)

480
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,505
(It's a whole gimbap.)

481
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,445
(You still have to eat it.)

482
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:29,570
(He decides to cut it with his teeth.)

483
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:33,570
(He takes a huge bite.)

484
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:35,955
(He pulls out the spinach.)

485
00:19:36,712 --> 00:19:38,040
(Laughing)

486
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,755
(Kwang Soo gets hit.)

487
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,025
(Poor Kwang Soo.)

488
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:46,320
(Both of them succeed in eating gimbap.)

489
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,365
(Words that someone used...)

490
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:51,890
(A staff member's cell phone rings by mistake.)

491
00:19:51,894 --> 00:19:55,545
(We didn't make the sound.)

492
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,375
That's just your luck.

493
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,315
(They're unlucky as always.)

494
00:20:01,036 --> 00:20:05,740
(After many controversies, Suk Jin and Kwang Soo's time is up.)

495
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:06,800
It was a lot.

496
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:07,810
They ate a lot.

497
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,270
One of my ears is numb because of Jong Kook's hammer sound.

498
00:20:09,278 --> 00:20:10,540
- I was being accurate. - He hit too hard.

499
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,695
I only looked at the number.

500
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:14,110
By the way,

501
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,850
this hasn't happened in 30 years.

502
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,965
Udon broth is coming out of my nose.

503
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,590
It happened when I was in elementary school while drinking milk.

504
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,690
It's leaking.

505
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:25,790
Next up are me and So Min.

506
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,020
How will we eat the apple?

507
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,290
(Pork cutlet, apple, Sprite with ice)

508
00:20:28,297 --> 00:20:29,430
Goodness.

509
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,500
Get ready, set, go.

510
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,745
(Their meal starts.)

511
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:34,470
(Let's eat the pork cutlet first.)

512
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,785
(That sounds good.)

513
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,685
(Where is the music coming from?)

514
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,040
(There's a sound.)

515
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:47,295
(He's dumbfounded.)

516
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,265
(Did you play it, Kwang Soo?)

517
00:20:54,323 --> 00:20:55,320
(Where is it?)

518
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:56,535
(Squeak)

519
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,590
(He pretends not to know.)

520
00:20:58,594 --> 00:20:59,805
(Squeak)

521
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:02,875
(He leans forward to stop him from searching.)

522
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,775
(The sound is coming from here.)

523
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,900
(He finds a cell phone.)

524
00:21:07,903 --> 00:21:09,730
(It was my alarm.)

525
00:21:09,738 --> 00:21:11,030
He set an alarm.

526
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,015
(He set an alarm to create a sound.)

527
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,570
You said that it's luck.

528
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:17,740
(You said the staff's phone ringing was my luck.)

529
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:19,595
(They resume their eating.)

530
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:22,795
(I'll cut the pork cutlet.)

531
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,695
(She's about to cut it.)

532
00:21:27,055 --> 00:21:30,090
(Crunch)

533
00:21:30,092 --> 00:21:31,775
(A loud crunch)

534
00:21:32,227 --> 00:21:33,320
(Squeak)

535
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:35,105
(Cut it quietly.)

536
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:40,800
(She tries it again carefully.)

537
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,815
(Crunch)

538
00:21:43,572 --> 00:21:45,270
(My goodness.)

539
00:21:45,274 --> 00:21:47,185
(She cuts it quickly.)

540
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:49,985
(She gives up.)

541
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:53,595
(It's hard to take a bite of pork cutlet.)

542
00:21:56,151 --> 00:21:59,065
(I should eat the whole piece.)

543
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,535
(You should cut it.)

544
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,020
(Can't I just eat it?)

545
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:06,535
(You have to cut it.)

546
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:08,160
Don Spike tore it with his teeth.

547
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:10,490
(Don Spike tore it with his teeth.)

548
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,215
(Your talking is loud.)

549
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:15,115
(Why do I have to cut mine?)

550
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:18,815
(Just cut it how I did.)

551
00:22:19,474 --> 00:22:22,910
(He cuts it carefully.)

552
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,685
(I got it.)

553
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:29,265
(People attack at different times.)

554
00:22:29,484 --> 00:22:31,795
(He's getting annoyed.)

555
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:35,035
(This is for Jae Suk.)

556
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,505
(He puts the detector close to him.)

557
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:43,345
(He puts the detector close just for Jae Suk.)

558
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,130
(Move it away.)

559
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:47,745
(The crunchy sounds should be aired.)

560
00:22:48,403 --> 00:22:50,385
(Good job, Kwang Soo.)

561
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:53,355
(So Min tries to eat the apple.)

562
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,355
(She'll make a sound no matter what.)

563
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:01,295
(She puts it close to her teeth.)

564
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,295
(You're doing well.)

565
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,420
(She takes a bite.)

566
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:09,705
(The sound isn't over 60db.)

567
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,775
(It's unbelievable how quietly she eats.)

568
00:23:14,262 --> 00:23:16,705
(They approve of So Min.)

569
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:20,345
(It's your turn to take a bite, Jae Suk.)

570
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:24,715
(Jae Suk will make a sound no matter what.)

571
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,640
(He starts off quite well.)

572
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:32,210
(Crunch)

573
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:33,525
(Hitting)

574
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,795
(His glasses fall off.)

575
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:40,795
(I'm sorry, Jae Suk.)

576
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:44,435
(We have Sprite left.)

577
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:47,535
(Opening the can is expected to be loud.)

578
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:51,400
(She does it carefully.)

579
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
(Squeak)

580
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,045
(She gets hit.)

581
00:23:55,003 --> 00:23:57,485
(He also gets hit. It's okay, keep going.)

582
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:00,570
(She's more careful on her second try.)

583
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,185
(It makes a sound.)

584
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:06,255
(What kind of breakfast is this?)

585
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:12,065
(Have some, Jae Suk.)

586
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,935
(He accepts it nervously.)

587
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:20,590
(He pulls out his lips and drinks.)

588
00:24:20,595 --> 00:24:21,760
His lips are dirty.

589
00:24:21,763 --> 00:24:23,860
(Look, his lips are dirty.)

590
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,475
(He chokes.)

591
00:24:29,071 --> 00:24:31,000
(He burps.)

592
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:32,215
(Squeaking)

593
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,685
(The bubbles explode because he drank too fast.)

594
00:24:35,911 --> 00:24:38,055
(The sound of his burp is funny.)

595
00:24:39,214 --> 00:24:41,695
(You drink it this time.)

596
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:45,820
(She swallows it.)

597
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:47,335
(It's very close.)

598
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,075
(It'll go over 60db soon.)

599
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:57,030
(She drinks almost all of it.)

600
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,875
(Ice cubes make a sound.)

601
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:02,370
(Squeaking)

602
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,515
(Burping)

603
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:10,025
(An actress burp is aired.)

604
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:15,025
(Sounds from So Min's body get extensive.)

605
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,750
(Jae Suk and So Min finish eating.)

606
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,650
- We're done. - Goodness.

607
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:20,820
- You did well. - Seriously.

608
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:23,335
- You did well. - I thought the apple would be bad.

609
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:24,620
They didn't fail.

610
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,760
I thought my teeth were coming off.

611
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,275
My teeth almost came off.

612
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:31,560
That was great. Okay.

613
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:33,400
Next up are Se Chan and Haha.

614
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:34,830
- Have a seat. - I'll sit here.

615
00:25:34,836 --> 00:25:36,600
These will be hard.

616
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,000
All of them will be noisy.

617
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,940
What's this?

618
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,370
- It's to break this. - You have to break it to eat.

619
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,585
Come on.

620
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,010
This will be hard.

621
00:25:45,013 --> 00:25:46,295
(They'll get hit a lot.)

622
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:47,710
Get ready, set.

623
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:49,295
- This is terrible. - Start.

624
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:52,835
(He takes it carefully.)

625
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,690
(Crunch)

626
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:58,005
(He gets hit.)

627
00:25:59,361 --> 00:26:02,045
(Jong Kook acts as a police officer.)

628
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:05,030
(We have to tear the bag and break it.)

629
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,600
(He can't believe it.)

630
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:09,885
(Your laughter is too loud.)

631
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,885
(I only looked at the number.)

632
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:15,570
(The problem is opening the Schneeballen.)

633
00:26:15,577 --> 00:26:16,640
(Crunch)

634
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:18,555
(Squeak)

635
00:26:19,047 --> 00:26:22,625
(I tore it opened, but what's going on?)

636
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:25,350
He didn't tear it properly.

637
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:28,865
(He only tore open the outside.)

638
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:31,305
(Poor Se Chan.)

639
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:34,830
(Haha.)

640
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,160
(It's not coming out.)

641
00:26:37,165 --> 00:26:38,845
(He laughs.)

642
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,945
(You have to open the inside bag too.)

643
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:43,970
(I'll open it again.)

644
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:45,285
(Come on...)

645
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,185
(Why did you take that part off.)

646
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:52,725
(His head is numb from getting hit so much.)

647
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:57,580
(If the Schneeballen has no way out,)

648
00:26:57,586 --> 00:26:59,735
(then this is the only way.)

649
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:02,965
(He opens it while shouting.)

650
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:05,775
(He hits it with the hammer.)

651
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:09,375
(The squeaky hammer festival begins.)

652
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:12,830
(Just eat everything you can!)

653
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:14,775
(Eating frantically)

654
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,770
(Drink the cola too!)

655
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:17,985
(Opening)

656
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,285
(It's impossible to count how many times they got hit.)

657
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:28,795
(There are still rice crackers left even after all of this.)

658
00:27:29,351 --> 00:27:31,995
(You take care of this.)

659
00:27:32,153 --> 00:27:35,205
Aren't they set for last place?

660
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:38,560
(My real game starts when they begin to tease me for being last.)

661
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,760
(Mission Impossible, "Rice Crackers")

662
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:40,820
Can you open it?

663
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:41,830
(Mission Impossible, "Rice Crackers")

664
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,560
(Carefully finish the rice crackers under 60dB)

665
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:48,470
It's so funny how he pretends to be careful.

666
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,670
(What is he doing?)

667
00:27:49,671 --> 00:27:52,355
(That's right.)

668
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:55,170
What more do you want when you guys are already in the last place?

669
00:27:55,176 --> 00:27:56,340
Just eat it.

670
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:58,025
(Let's just eat it all!)

671
00:27:58,914 --> 00:28:02,410
(Game ends after they chew everything down angrily.)

672
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:05,220
We were given the most difficult snacks to eat.

673
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,780
- Snacks are difficult. - They're really hard.

674
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,020
The air from the AC is flowing this way.

675
00:28:11,026 --> 00:28:13,320
- Yes, it's because of the wind - Is that right?

676
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,560
It's constantly at around 60dB.

677
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:16,490
Well, we can't do anything about nature changes.

678
00:28:16,498 --> 00:28:18,160
(It's unfortunate.)

679
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,100
It's "natural disasters".

680
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:23,170
What on earth does he mean by "natural changes". My goodness.

681
00:28:23,171 --> 00:28:24,670
- "Natural change". - You are the real "nature change".

682
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:27,140
Don't use phrases you are uncertain about.

683
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:28,385
How embarrassing.

684
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:32,480
The final result of the mission is a victory for Ji Hyo and Jong Kook.

685
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,580
(They win with 14 accumulated squeaky hammer hits.)

686
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:36,050
- They chose a good meal. - Please choose...

687
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,580
who will receive the hint out of the two.

688
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:41,890
For the hint, you can choose between the R Leader or spies A, B, C,

689
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,635
and the hint will disappear after five seconds.

690
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,305
(Five seconds is so short.)

691
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,760
(A symbol of "Mission Impossible", disappearance after five seconds)

692
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:51,545
That's really cool.

693
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,475
I forgot Tom Cruise is going to be on the show today.

694
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,670
Don't forget that.

695
00:28:56,671 --> 00:28:57,830
He's the main guest.

696
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,440
Please choose who will get the hint.

697
00:29:00,442 --> 00:29:02,070
Between the two of us? Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

698
00:29:02,077 --> 00:29:03,510
- Let's do it. - Rock-paper-scissors

699
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:04,770
(Ji Hyo wins right away.)

700
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,380
You can choose between the leader of R Agency,

701
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,580
or M Agency's spies A, B, C.

702
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:11,250
(Since Ji Hyo is an R Agent, her choice will naturally be...)

703
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:14,580
I want the hint on M Agent A.

704
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,590
(Out of M Agents Jae Suk, So Min, and Se Chan)

705
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:20,775
(A hint on one of the M Agents will be revealed!)

706
00:29:22,097 --> 00:29:25,545
(M agent A is over 40 years old.)

707
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,570
(It applies to Haha, Suk Jin, Jae Suk, and Jong Kook.)

708
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,370
(Which means that the hint was on Jae Suk.)

709
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:32,640
Now we move on to the next mission.

710
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,055
Let's go!

711
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,225
Okay.

712
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:39,310
You guys are aware that there are three spies...

713
00:29:39,314 --> 00:29:41,580
- and the R Leader among you. - Who's the spy?

714
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,850
R Leader should let us know as soon as possible.

715
00:29:43,852 --> 00:29:45,480
He should let us know somehow.

716
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:46,980
I'm not the Leader.

717
00:29:46,988 --> 00:29:49,520
- I'm the Leader. - I already told you it's me.

718
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:51,620
The scale of today's show...

719
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:54,320
is too big for Suk Jin to be the Leader.

720
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:55,330
(That's so rude...)

721
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,175
I'll fit that scale.

722
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,830
It might be possible...

723
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,330
if Tom Cruise wasn't coming today.

724
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:03,230
A battle between Tom Cruise and Suk Jin is just weird.

725
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:05,840
It'd be so awkward.

726
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,070
I'm the one only person whose around the same age as Tom Cruise.

727
00:30:09,077 --> 00:30:11,840
"One only person"?

728
00:30:11,846 --> 00:30:14,210
"One only person"? He's leaving some wise words today.

729
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:16,480
Please, get some sleep while we get there.

730
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:19,320
- We gathered too early. - Being a radio DJ didn't help him.

731
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,495
- I need to have lines to speak. - Suk Jin!

732
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,760
Anyhow, if all members successfully complete the next mission...

733
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,560
a common hint that applies to all three spies...

734
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:31,230
(Success in the mission will lead to a common hint on the spies)

735
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:34,560
It will be given to everyone.

736
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:35,870
We can make an educated guess with that.

737
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,270
But have we ever won a group mission like this?

738
00:30:38,273 --> 00:30:40,640
- Very rarely. - It's so difficult.

739
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,240
- This mission is... - Please give us something easy.

740
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,970
called "3 Characters in 1 Second".

741
00:30:44,979 --> 00:30:46,310
What is that?

742
00:30:46,314 --> 00:30:47,310
("3 Characters in 1 Second")

743
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:51,095
It's a mission in which a person tells a story with three letters.

744
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,780
If all eight members successfully finishes a sentence...

745
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,590
using 3 characters in 1 second for each member...

746
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,750
according to the subject that we give you.

747
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,290
(The mission cleared when 8 members complete a full sentence.)

748
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:01,160
This is hard. Making sentences is not that easy.

749
00:31:01,162 --> 00:31:03,930
Whoever messes up here is a spy.

750
00:31:03,932 --> 00:31:05,560
He's right, if they mess up here...

751
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,760
This is the perfect mission to find out who's the spy.

752
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,385
- This should be easy. - Hey, Mr. Suk Jin...

753
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,070
- why are you... - What do you mean, Mr. Suk Jin?

754
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:15,170
Hey, sir...

755
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:16,470
why are you acting this way.

756
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:18,910
You're making me mad.

757
00:31:18,913 --> 00:31:21,280
When should I punish him?

758
00:31:21,282 --> 00:31:24,050
It wouldn't be too late if I do it within this year, right?

759
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:25,420
Show us at least once.

760
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,235
To be honest, it's a difficult thing to say in our relationship,

761
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,650
but you can come at me from behind if you'd like.

762
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:34,820
(You can come at me from any angle.)

763
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:38,605
He's almost saying he can take you on with his hands tied.

764
00:31:38,766 --> 00:31:40,760
Yes, you can come at me from behind.

765
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:43,330
So sweet.

766
00:31:43,338 --> 00:31:44,630
(Anyone volunteer for his "honey punch?)

767
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,240
Sweet, sweet, Mr. Sweet.

768
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:49,340
I don't even know how much power I'm packing here.

769
00:31:49,344 --> 00:31:51,240
Okay, Mr. Sweet.

770
00:31:51,246 --> 00:31:53,210
Lend me those hands when we drink coffee, I can use some honey in it.

771
00:31:53,214 --> 00:31:54,280
To sweeten your coffee?

772
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:55,380
It'll be like putting sugar in your coffee.

773
00:31:55,383 --> 00:31:57,510
"Suyu-ri's Honey Punch".

774
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,350
We'll begin now, and the subject is "farewell".

775
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:03,190
- Farewell. - It's a sad topic.

776
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:05,490
- Who starts? - We'll start with Jong Kook.

777
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,460
- Ready, set... - I start first.

778
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:10,230
say "3 Characters in 1 Second".

779
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:13,400
"3 Characters in 1 Second, start!"

780
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:14,675
Ji Hyo...

781
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,015
Yesterday...

782
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,470
To Suk Jin...

783
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:20,240
(Incorrect)

784
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:22,270
("To Suk Jin" in a game that is limited to three letters?)

785
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,970
- That was four characters. - Come on, Suk Jin.

786
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:27,710
- Let's extend it to four letters. - Listen.

787
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:29,950
- It just has to go with the rhythm. - Is he a spy?

788
00:32:29,951 --> 00:32:32,520
Why do you play so dirty?

789
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,290
"To Suk Jin" is just stupid.

790
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,820
I'm not taking this out only because it's so dangerous.

791
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:40,360
He hid his honey punch in the honey pot.

792
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's have some honey.

793
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,460
Remember, I'm not taking this out only because it's dangerous.

794
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,630
It's all over when I take this out.

795
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:47,130
The game's stopped because of you.

796
00:32:47,135 --> 00:32:49,830
Suk Jin, stop getting scolded.

797
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:51,830
- We're just having a conversation. - That's not true.

798
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,570
It's just a conversation.

799
00:32:53,575 --> 00:32:55,570
It's such a one-sided conversation.

800
00:32:55,577 --> 00:32:57,410
(Have some honey when you get scolded.)

801
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:00,710
As soon as I take my fist out, you guys are all finished.

802
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:02,210
- It's a honey pot. - It is.

803
00:33:02,217 --> 00:33:04,925
We will give you one more chance, the next subject is...

804
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,050
- "Ennui". - That's a hard subject.

805
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:10,505
This will be the last game before we arrive.

806
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:11,550
Ennui.

807
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,220
- Let's go. - Okay.

808
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:17,030
(Will they succeed this time and get the hint?)

809
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:19,775
"3 Characters in 1 Second", start!

810
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:21,545
Is Jae Suk...

811
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:22,885
Having Ennui...

812
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:24,245
Right now?

813
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:25,615
I don't think so.

814
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,515
I'm not sure about that.

815
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,340
(Incorrect)

816
00:33:30,345 --> 00:33:33,510
- He just didn't want to answer. - What was that?

817
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,280
- It's three characters. - I was trying to end the game.

818
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,480
- I was trying to end the game. - What was that?

819
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,980
Jong Kook's face just now...

820
00:33:39,988 --> 00:33:42,420
had the loveliest expression I've seen of him so far.

821
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:43,690
Why?

822
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:45,220
"What was that?"

823
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:46,490
(What was that?)

824
00:33:46,494 --> 00:33:48,320
- I did? - Yes, you did.

825
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,290
- Am I the only one who saw? - I missed it.

826
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:52,460
- He really said it like that. - Really?

827
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:55,685
- Yes. - Me? I didn't do that.

828
00:33:56,871 --> 00:33:59,300
(Just a moment ago)

829
00:33:59,307 --> 00:34:00,370
(Cute laughs)

830
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:03,270
(What was that?)

831
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,140
(Sweet nasally voice)

832
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,580
(One more serving of sweetness, please)

833
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:08,810
I did that? How did you even see that?

834
00:34:08,816 --> 00:34:10,565
Recently, you've been staring at Jong Kook a lot.

835
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,980
What is up with you?

836
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:15,150
You're acting weird.

837
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:16,690
Now you've moved onto Jong Kook?

838
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:19,020
- Mission failed. - Give us one more chance.

839
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:22,190
Let's try to succeed at least once.

840
00:34:22,196 --> 00:34:24,960
Can you give us something easier, those two were too hard.

841
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,960
For those of you who wanted one more opportunity...

842
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,400
only four of you will need to get it right on the next mission.

843
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:32,670
That's good news.

844
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:35,940
The next mission is, "Same Beds, Different Body".

845
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,940
What?

846
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:40,580
The question will be on the four fundamental arithmetic operations.

847
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:43,480
Say the correct answer and indicate the wrong answer with your fingers.

848
00:34:43,484 --> 00:34:45,650
- If you do it right, you win. - It's like the Idiot Game.

849
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:46,920
Okay.

850
00:34:46,921 --> 00:34:49,405
We can pass this no matter what.

851
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:50,520
Only the four of us needs to get it right.

852
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:52,460
We have a good chance of winning.

853
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,860
Each person needs to get it right three times.

854
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:58,360
(Each person needs three correct answer to win.)

855
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:00,330
In the order of addition, multiplication, and subtraction.

856
00:35:00,335 --> 00:35:01,400
That's difficult.

857
00:35:01,402 --> 00:35:03,370
The first person is very important.

858
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:06,570
First up is Jong Kook.

859
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,755
Then we move to Jae Suk.

860
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:11,840
- Hands and words separate, start! - Hands and words separate, start!

861
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:14,495
- 2 plus 1 is? - 3?

862
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,150
Hey.

863
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,250
(His fingers and mouth did say different things, but...)

864
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,320
Jong Kook, stop acting cute.

865
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:22,590
Why did you do it like that?

866
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,090
And what is up with the rhythm?

867
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,420
Your mouth was in a weird shape.

868
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:27,690
I'm sorry.

869
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:29,545
2 plus 2 is...

870
00:35:29,731 --> 00:35:31,460
Okay, I got it.

871
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:35,130
But I saw that you were trying to be cute at the end.

872
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:36,770
You did something like this.

873
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,530
Did you get a girlfriend or something?

874
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:40,940
People usually do this to indicate the number two.

875
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:43,155
- You did it like this. - He even opened his mouth.

876
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,440
- Did you chance your concept? - That's enough now.

877
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:47,040
- Seok Jin, that's enough. - That's enough.

878
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,950
- Okay. - Hey!

879
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:51,710
(Seok Jin, that's enough.)

880
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,295
- Hey. - That's enough.

881
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:54,680
- You're embarrassing Jong Kook. - That's enough already.

882
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,650
- We have a chemistry together. - Worry about yourself.

883
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,020
He's a shy guy.

884
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,960
Seok Jin, stop getting scolded!

885
00:35:59,961 --> 00:36:01,590
It's a conversation.

886
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,460
We're only having a conversation with each other.

887
00:36:03,464 --> 00:36:05,730
Do you want me to take this out?

888
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,560
- Gosh. Let's start with Suk Jin. - I'll start us off.

889
00:36:08,569 --> 00:36:10,970
- The beat is harder than I thought. - Look at me.

890
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:13,240
We begin now. Start.

891
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,940
- Hands and words separate, start! - Hands and words separate, start!

892
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:18,270
- 7 plus 2 is? - 9.

893
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:21,025
- 6 minus 3 is? - 2.

894
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,250
(Incorrect)

895
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,965
You already got it wrong.

896
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,420
(Super confident)

897
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,890
(Wrong mouth, correct fingers)

898
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,260
- You did 2 with your fingers? - You're trying to act cute, too.

899
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,920
- Why are you trying to act cute? - This is difficult.

900
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,460
- Why are you so bad at it? - You try it, it's hard.

901
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,700
How can you be so bad.

902
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,630
- It's not easy. - As a result,

903
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:43,330
you failed to get the hint.

904
00:36:43,337 --> 00:36:45,400
(They fail to win a hint about the spies.)

905
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:46,840
I agree with it.

906
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,670
- Seriously. - Who's the spy?

907
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:51,310
- The spy won so easily. - That's right.

908
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:53,425
We can't ask each other about it.

909
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:54,880
We can't say anything.

910
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:55,950
Everyone got it wrong.

911
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,380
- I have an idea. - Me too.

912
00:36:57,385 --> 00:36:58,865
(What mission awaits them?)

913
00:36:59,153 --> 00:37:02,420
- Olympic Park is very nice. - It's beautiful here.

914
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:04,405
I haven't seen sunlight in the morning in a while.

915
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:06,905
This is great. It is sunlight in the morning.

916
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,860
- It's a roulette. - What?

917
00:37:10,865 --> 00:37:13,060
(There's a colorful roulette in the middle of the park.)

918
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,275
Are we spinning it?

919
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:15,615
Why is there a roulette?

920
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:17,885
What is it?

921
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,840
It's set up well.

922
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,215
What are we doing?

923
00:37:21,442 --> 00:37:23,510
- There's a roulette. - What are we doing?

924
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,155
Next mission is called...

925
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:26,880
Time-out Shooting.

926
00:37:26,881 --> 00:37:27,880
What is it?

927
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:29,950
(3rd mission is called Time-out Shooting.)

928
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:30,950
"Shooting"?

929
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:32,435
It's a four-person team game.

930
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,150
The first half is water gun fight.

931
00:37:34,155 --> 00:37:36,690
The second half is Target Name Tag Elimination.

932
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,235
(Target Name Tag Elimination?)

933
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,590
Everyone.

934
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:41,160
(Everyone picks Jong Kook.)

935
00:37:41,162 --> 00:37:42,530
Come on, everyone.

936
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,290
- Don't fight. - That's right.

937
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:46,700
- It's not necessary. - Haha is right next to him.

938
00:37:46,701 --> 00:37:47,830
Stop it.

939
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:49,670
For the water gun fight,

940
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,115
find guns filled with paint of five colors all over the park.

941
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,570
- It'll be messy. - We have to find them.

942
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,610
That's why we're wearing this outfit.

943
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,180
Within 10 minutes,

944
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,980
hit the opponents with as many colors as possible.

945
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,250
With different colors?

946
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,765
We should change the colors quickly.

947
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:07,650
The last half is Target Name Tag Elimination.

948
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:09,465
Spin the colored roulette.

949
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,420
Whoever has the selected color on his outfit becomes the target.

950
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:15,135
Are we playing Name Tag Elimination as well?

951
00:38:16,731 --> 00:38:17,860
Mom's.

952
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,545
- Mom's... - Diary.

953
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,730
Let's go.

954
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:22,045
(What?)

955
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,570
- Not you. - I want to join.

956
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:25,070
The four of us will make a team.

957
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:28,340
- When did So Min join the team? - Why are you joining them?

958
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,610
Join us.

959
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,480
The team to eliminate a name tag within five minutes wins a point.

960
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,655
Once the target is out, we'll select a new target.

961
00:38:35,716 --> 00:38:37,380
The hint is given to 1 of the 4 members...

962
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:40,520
- from the winning team. - Let's go, my team.

963
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,735
- We can do it. - You can do it, Jong Kook.

964
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:45,235
You'll divide into two teams.

965
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:48,690
So Min and Ji Hyo will play rock-paper-scissors to pick members.

966
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:49,860
(Ji Hyo and So Min get to select the team.)

967
00:38:49,864 --> 00:38:51,060
It's So Min.

968
00:38:51,065 --> 00:38:53,500
The first and the last member to be selected...

969
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,330
are obvious.

970
00:38:55,336 --> 00:38:56,715
Play rock-paper-scissors.

971
00:38:57,505 --> 00:38:59,385
Rock-paper-scissors

972
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,940
(So Min wins.)

973
00:39:01,943 --> 00:39:04,940
Kim Jong Kook.

974
00:39:04,946 --> 00:39:07,440
Okay, that sounds good.

975
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:10,380
We must join So Min's team.

976
00:39:10,384 --> 00:39:12,210
- It has to be So Min's team. - Rock-paper-scissors

977
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,820
Rock-paper-scissors

978
00:39:13,821 --> 00:39:16,490
(Round 2 of rock-paper-scissors)

979
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:19,005
(Ji Hyo wins.)

980
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:20,690
(She ponders.)

981
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,790
Can I take him away?

982
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,145
No.

983
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,405
If it's possible, you have to play it forever.

984
00:39:26,901 --> 00:39:28,730
(They'll take Jong Kook back and forth all day.)

985
00:39:28,736 --> 00:39:29,870
We won't finish by today.

986
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,445
You have to play rock-paper-scissors until tomorrow.

987
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:33,715
Take Jong Kook back and forth.

988
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,500
- I pick Kwang Soo. - Okay.

989
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:36,940
(Ji Hyo picks Kwang Soo.)

990
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,655
(Sighing)

991
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,480
(Goodbye, Kwang Soo.)

992
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,750
- It's done. - It's done.

993
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:45,150
(Is it a fight with the tiger?)

994
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,320
Okay.

995
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,735
Rock-paper-scissors

996
00:39:48,022 --> 00:39:50,020
(So Min wins.)

997
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,520
(Okay!)

998
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:55,690
(Our team will win.)

999
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:58,630
Wait, no, it's not him.

1000
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:02,160
(Haha invites himself to her team.)

1001
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,000
- So Min. - Wait.

1002
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,885
No.

1003
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,700
- No, I pick Se Chan. - Okay.

1004
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:10,210
You're not close with her. Get away.

1005
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:11,925
Okay, okay.

1006
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:14,055
You're not close with her. Move out of the way.

1007
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:15,880
Things are getting strange here.

1008
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,050
(He's disappointed.)

1009
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,810
- You're making her uncomfortable. - We must win.

1010
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:21,295
We must win.

1011
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:23,490
- This round is important. - Rock-paper-scissors

1012
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:25,790
(So Min wins again.)

1013
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,305
Who plays it like that?

1014
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,230
(Ji Hyo isn't lucky today.)

1015
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,790
What's going on?

1016
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:33,900
Whom you pick now is important.

1017
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,230
(Let's go, "Mom's Diary" members.)

1018
00:40:35,236 --> 00:40:36,685
Pick Jae Suk.

1019
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,215
- Jae Suk. - Okay.

1020
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,840
(Jae Suk joins So Min's team.)

1021
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:43,440
- Seriously? - We're doomed.

1022
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:45,710
- Why did you pick me? - Is this our team?

1023
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:47,680
- You're the best on our team. - Why did she pick me?

1024
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,380
- You're the best. - Is this it?

1025
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,980
I'm not the best.

1026
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:53,480
- You're the best. - What?

1027
00:40:53,487 --> 00:40:54,965
Game is over.

1028
00:40:55,256 --> 00:40:56,520
Are you okay?

1029
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:57,650
Seriously,

1030
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,090
they're the weakest.

1031
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:00,690
We've never been a team before.

1032
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:02,460
- Okay. - It's over.

1033
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:04,745
- Thank you. It's over. - It's over.

1034
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,345
Let's get ready.

1035
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:09,270
- Okay, let's do it. - Should we wear a hat?

1036
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,470
Let's be serious.

1037
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:11,930
- That's right. - Let's try it.

1038
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:13,170
Will we use water guns?

1039
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,570
I'm not sure.

1040
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:16,210
Jae Suk and Jong Kook's team...

1041
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,910
- should go over there. - Okay.

1042
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:20,695
The other team will near the sculpture.

1043
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,610
This is my first time.

1044
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,580
- We're the stronger team. - Aren't you happy?

1045
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:30,090
I'm going to play seriously. I'm annoyed.

1046
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,250
(Let me show the power of the eldest.)

1047
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,790
You just wait and see.

1048
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,860
You'll see how fast... How fast...

1049
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:36,345
Come on, Suk Jin.

1050
00:41:36,363 --> 00:41:37,630
- Can you talk? - He can't talk.

1051
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:39,915
Our team can't even talk.

1052
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:44,130
If the paint gets on the clothes, the person...

1053
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:46,555
- Let's not cheer. - She doesn't know the rules.

1054
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,270
She doesn't even know the rules.

1055
00:41:48,275 --> 00:41:49,810
- Hey, the best member. - Try to avoid them.

1056
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,040
- Don't be like that. - Why am I the best?

1057
00:41:51,045 --> 00:41:53,210
- You're the best one. - Why am I the best?

1058
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:54,540
- Let's go. - I'll be the best.

1059
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,880
Let's go.

1060
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,250
(Their cheer is weak.)

1061
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,880
- Let's go. - We can do it.

1062
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:01,020
Let's go.

1063
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:02,520
- Let's go. - All right.

1064
00:42:02,523 --> 00:42:04,490
(Let's go and play.)

1065
00:42:04,492 --> 00:42:06,790
- In 3, 2, 1, let's go. - Let's go.

1066
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:09,775
It's a water gun fight. We don't need strength for this.

1067
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:11,460
- Search well, So Min. - Okay.

1068
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:12,830
Go.

1069
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,060
They're within the boundary, right?

1070
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,715
- Are they hidden over there? - Let's see.

1071
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:20,940
- We must find them. - Find them quickly.

1072
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:22,910
(Kwang Soo runs as soon as they start.)

1073
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,040
- What? - Here it is.

1074
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,695
(He finds a water gun.)

1075
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:28,595
- Attack right away. - Shall I go?

1076
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:31,465
(I'll destroy all of you.)

1077
00:42:33,521 --> 00:42:35,535
- He found a water gun. - Really?

1078
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,920
- I mean the other team. - Go now.

1079
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:40,305
(They're surprised by how quick the others are.)

1080
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:42,335
He already found one.

1081
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,790
He found a water gun.

1082
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:45,490
- What color is it, Suk Jin? - What?

1083
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:47,945
- What color is it? - I think it's yellow.

1084
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,385
What color is yours?

1085
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,855
Don't shoot at me.

1086
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,710
(He shoots at him while trying to show the color.)

1087
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:59,280
(Shooting)

1088
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,340
I'm sorry. Why did you shoot at me?

1089
00:43:01,348 --> 00:43:03,250
Did I get shot?

1090
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,980
- This doesn't count. - It doesn't?

1091
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,480
You shot me too.

1092
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:08,295
- How could you shoot at me? - Goodness.

1093
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:10,520
How could you?

1094
00:43:10,524 --> 00:43:11,950
(They start off by shooting the same team.)

1095
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,405
We must shoot them quickly.

1096
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:14,905
Is it big?

1097
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:16,575
(Here it is.)

1098
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:20,715
(Things are working out for her today.)

1099
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:21,860
Come on.

1100
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:22,900
(Come on.)

1101
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:25,085
(Here's an attack.)

1102
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:29,840
(The one with the selected color becomes the name tag target.)

1103
00:43:29,844 --> 00:43:31,055
I got you.

1104
00:43:31,345 --> 00:43:32,880
I can't find any water gun.

1105
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,110
(Getting the least number of colors is the best.)

1106
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,425
It's orange.

1107
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:42,150
(The 10-minute water gun fight is over.)

1108
00:43:42,156 --> 00:43:44,365
Everyone, stand with your team.

1109
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:45,860
I knew I'd get hit with most of the colors.

1110
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,805
I got all the colors on me.

1111
00:43:48,796 --> 00:43:51,545
(No blue on Jae Suk, all for Se Chan and Jong Kook, no green on So Min)

1112
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:53,000
We don't have blue.

1113
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,275
There's no blue.

1114
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:57,400
(None of them have blue on them.)

1115
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:58,885
Look at him.

1116
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:00,940
(What's this?)

1117
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:02,500
Look.

1118
00:44:02,509 --> 00:44:03,610
Chul Min.

1119
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:05,825
Shouldn't Kwang Soo change his pants?

1120
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,480
Look at where it's stained.

1121
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,550
- Kwang Soo. - It's okay. Leave it.

1122
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:13,480
(Does it look that bad?)

1123
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,020
Let's see if it's better on the front or the back.

1124
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:17,820
(He shows his care.)

1125
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:20,905
(It wasn't care at all.)

1126
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:25,030
(He runs away with his shorts.)

1127
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:26,445
Wait.

1128
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,045
Stop it.

1129
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,570
Look at his buttocks.

1130
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,285
Where are Kwang Soo's buttocks?

1131
00:44:31,572 --> 00:44:33,770
Jae Suk, you also took Kwang Soo's buttocks.

1132
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,255
Stop it.

1133
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,840
(People in Jamsil saw a skinny marathon runner in leggings.)

1134
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:38,940
Stop it.

1135
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,925
(People in Jamsil saw a skinny marathon runner in leggings.)

1136
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:43,380
Don't film me.

1137
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:45,195
(Don't film me.)

1138
00:44:46,654 --> 00:44:48,795
We have no hope if it isn't blue.

1139
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:50,735
Let's do it.

1140
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:53,505
- It's over once eliminated. - We don't have to run away.

1141
00:44:53,594 --> 00:44:55,520
- We have to fight. - Let's fight.

1142
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:57,190
We just have to avoid blue.

1143
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,890
- Do we have all colors? - Yes.

1144
00:44:58,899 --> 00:45:00,060
I have all colors.

1145
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:02,400
We'll spin the roulette.

1146
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:04,830
(It's time to select the color.)

1147
00:45:04,838 --> 00:45:06,255
I hope it's blue.

1148
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:09,885
Please don't be blue.

1149
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:11,440
Please.

1150
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:12,540
Please spin it.

1151
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,380
(Once the target is out, a color is selected again.)

1152
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,850
Let it be blue. Please let it be blue.

1153
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,080
(Once the target is out, a color is selected again.)

1154
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:19,650
I have a bad feeling about this.

1155
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:23,605
(It's the rule of Target Name Tag Elimination.)

1156
00:45:25,292 --> 00:45:26,460
It's orange.

1157
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,290
(The target color is orange.)

1158
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,545
We lost.

1159
00:45:29,863 --> 00:45:31,175
Gosh.

1160
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:32,730
Stay out of it.

1161
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,615
- It's a children's play. - What?

1162
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:36,270
It's a children's play.

1163
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,570
Stay out of it, Jong Kook.

1164
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,170
(Once one person is out, the round is over.)

1165
00:45:39,173 --> 00:45:41,885
Seriously. Jong Kook should stay out of this.

1166
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:44,825
We know that there's no use of running away.

1167
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:46,880
He's here.

1168
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,380
(He runs forward.)

1169
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,750
- He's here. - Catch anyone.

1170
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,125
Go.

1171
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:54,320
No, no way.

1172
00:45:54,321 --> 00:45:56,905
(They run backwards.)

1173
00:45:57,391 --> 00:46:00,160
(Here's our chance.)

1174
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,090
(Suk Jin is quite experienced with playing.)

1175
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,360
We got it.

1176
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:05,045
- Goodness. - Got it.

1177
00:46:05,065 --> 00:46:06,360
- I got it. - It's done.

1178
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:10,900
- Oh, no. - We got him.

1179
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,485
Okay.

1180
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,570
Suk Jin is eliminated.

1181
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:15,670
Let's go.

1182
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:17,655
Take him to jail.

1183
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:21,340
(I want to go home.)

1184
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,095
It's been a long time since we played this game.

1185
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:25,625
We haven't played Name Tag Elimination in a long time.

1186
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:27,035
The race starts.

1187
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,420
- Who eliminated the name tag? - I did.

1188
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:31,305
Great job, Jong Kook.

1189
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:33,290
I wish we could throw the name tag somewhere.

1190
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:34,790
- I've never done it. - That's right.

1191
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,360
- You're amazing. - It's okay.

1192
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:37,860
We need blue.

1193
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:40,045
(It's over if we lose again.)

1194
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,000
If it's blue, let's eliminate Jong Kook.

1195
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:43,215
- Okay. - Good.

1196
00:46:43,337 --> 00:46:45,000
They're nothing without Jong Kook.

1197
00:46:45,005 --> 00:46:46,255
You're right.

1198
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:48,485
If it's blue, let's eliminate Jong Kook.

1199
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:49,710
Spin it, please.

1200
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,310
(Color roulette start!)

1201
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:53,525
It's spinning now.

1202
00:46:53,714 --> 00:46:55,380
Forget everyone else, get Jong Kook.

1203
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:57,210
(If it isn't blue, Sparta Kook will go after them.)

1204
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,820
(If it is blue, the other team's one-sided counterattack begins.)

1205
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,650
(The target color is blue.)

1206
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,520
- Blue! - Okay.

1207
00:47:03,524 --> 00:47:05,805
(It's blue!)

1208
00:47:05,859 --> 00:47:08,090
(It's blue, we're done for.)

1209
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:09,360
Here they come.

1210
00:47:09,363 --> 00:47:10,430
What should we do?

1211
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:11,630
So Min, let's have you in the front.

1212
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:12,690
Stop there.

1213
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,130
Please don't abandon me.

1214
00:47:14,134 --> 00:47:15,300
So Min.

1215
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:16,370
It's blue!

1216
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,370
(Let's go get Jong Kook!)

1217
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:19,440
Here we come.

1218
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,255
(Hysteric laughs)

1219
00:47:21,275 --> 00:47:22,840
(I'm the bait, come and get me.)

1220
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,210
Get me.

1221
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,380
Why is no one getting me?

1222
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:28,880
Why is everyone ignoring me?

1223
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:30,650
Come here.

1224
00:47:30,651 --> 00:47:32,325
So Min, come here.

1225
00:47:32,386 --> 00:47:33,620
So Min.

1226
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,235
(We only have to wait five minutes until the roulette spins again.)

1227
00:47:36,256 --> 00:47:37,390
Let's help her.

1228
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:39,250
Hey So Min, get them!

1229
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:40,290
Get them!

1230
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:41,590
(Great teamwork from M Agents, they're only protecting Jong Kook!)

1231
00:47:41,595 --> 00:47:43,675
Get me please!

1232
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,500
(Jong Kook runs away to plain fields.)

1233
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:50,170
(While other members create distractions.)

1234
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,785
Get So Min!

1235
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,400
Hey, Ji Hyo!

1236
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:56,325
Get me.

1237
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:57,770
Get away from me!

1238
00:47:57,778 --> 00:47:58,840
(Go away, I'm busy.)

1239
00:47:58,846 --> 00:48:00,310
(Get me before you go.)

1240
00:48:00,314 --> 00:48:02,455
Take it off! Rip it off of me!

1241
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:04,465
(He's getting in the way.)

1242
00:48:05,152 --> 00:48:06,220
Let go of me!

1243
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,650
(Bites)

1244
00:48:07,654 --> 00:48:08,920
(Painful teeth)

1245
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,235
You're not the one I want.

1246
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:15,420
(Ace Kook on the run from his fanatic fans.)

1247
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:21,575
(His tag must be removed before the target color changes.)

1248
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:26,640
(Get me before you go.)

1249
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,340
Come out here.

1250
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:29,770
Hurry.

1251
00:48:29,776 --> 00:48:32,210
(Jong Kook hides while Jae Seok distracts.)

1252
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,825
- You're not going anywhere. - Haha.

1253
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:37,095
- We have to get him. - You can't go anywhere.

1254
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:38,965
Two minutes before the roulette change!

1255
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,365
I'll do something.

1256
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:42,480
We have to get him.

1257
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:46,805
(I get the tiger today.)

1258
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:49,630
Try me. Try ripping it off.

1259
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,905
(There's no one I can't beat.)

1260
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,360
Rip it off.

1261
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,170
(Screams in pain)

1262
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:57,385
Hold on.

1263
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:58,715
Ji Hyo!

1264
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,985
(Screams in pain)

1265
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:03,485
Haha, you're the only one left.

1266
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:05,210
You're alone now.

1267
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:06,525
Rip off my name tag first.

1268
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,580
(He tried to catch the tiger.)

1269
00:49:07,581 --> 00:49:10,480
(Now he's about to face the consequences.)

1270
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,650
Hey, Ji Hyo!

1271
00:49:11,652 --> 00:49:14,150
- Hey, this is our last chance! - This is our last chance, Haha.

1272
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:15,435
We won't get blue again.

1273
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:17,465
One minute before the roulette change!

1274
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,090
Hurry up and get the tag.

1275
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:22,720
(With a minute left, Ace Ji Hyo goes on the hunt.)

1276
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:23,730
Get him.

1277
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,045
Get him right now!

1278
00:49:25,566 --> 00:49:26,830
Try it.

1279
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,830
Hurry up.

1280
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:28,860
(Mapo-gu duo versus Jong Kook and So Min)

1281
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:29,900
We have to stop her.

1282
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,570
Stop Ji Hyo.

1283
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:32,785
(Mapo-gu duo versus Jong Kook and So Min)

1284
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:36,040
Get So Min instead!

1285
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,540
If you can't get him, at least get So Min.

1286
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:39,340
- Move. - At least get So Min!

1287
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:40,980
- Isn't time up yet? - Take anyone's name tag off!

1288
00:49:40,981 --> 00:49:42,540
(When the color changes, they lose the chance to get at least a point.)

1289
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:43,980
Get So Min instead?

1290
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,450
No, wait!

1291
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:47,120
Time is up, the roulette spins now.

1292
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,020
(The 5 minutes are up, the roulette will spin now.)

1293
00:49:49,022 --> 00:49:51,520
- Wait it out. - Get the tag!

1294
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:52,650
(The roulette is spinning, we have to get something!)

1295
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,790
(Lies down on the ground)

1296
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:55,060
- Wait it out! - Get So Min's name tag!

1297
00:49:55,062 --> 00:49:56,360
(So Min chooses the strategy of laying down.)

1298
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:58,230
The time is up, the roulette will spin now.

1299
00:49:58,232 --> 00:49:59,730
(The roulette begins to spin.)

1300
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,860
(If they wait this out, a new target will be set.)

1301
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:02,970
Please, let me go.

1302
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:04,400
- Should I rip her name tag off? - Let me go please.

1303
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:05,530
- We have to get her! - Ji Hyo.

1304
00:50:05,539 --> 00:50:06,640
Please, let me go.

1305
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,940
We have five seconds left, get the tag!

1306
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:10,440
- Get the tag! - Hang in there!

1307
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:11,710
Get the tag now!

1308
00:50:11,712 --> 00:50:12,980
- Take it off! - Hang on!

1309
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,480
(With her tag halfway off, will they get the point?)

1310
00:50:15,482 --> 00:50:16,795
Try to wait it out.

1311
00:50:17,484 --> 00:50:18,480
Rip it off!

1312
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,295
Roulette change! Green!

1313
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:22,080
- We got it! - Hang on!

1314
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:23,190
So Min is out!

1315
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,250
No, she's not out!

1316
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:25,505
(Just before So Min's tag was ripped off...)

1317
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:28,360
(the target changed to green, which So Min doesn't have.)

1318
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,060
Roulette change! Green!

1319
00:50:30,063 --> 00:50:32,075
(The target changed to green, which So Min doesn't have.)

1320
00:50:33,867 --> 00:50:35,060
No!

1321
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:38,470
(Situation turned in an instant.)

1322
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:40,215
- Let's get them! - Kwang Soo, no!

1323
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,485
I'm out!

1324
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,170
(Kwang Soo is out of the game from So Min's counterattack.)

1325
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:47,440
Kwang Soo is out!

1326
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:48,695
He's out.

1327
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:50,150
(The roulette changed, so you're out.)

1328
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,925
You got her after the roulette was spun.

1329
00:50:51,985 --> 00:50:53,735
I didn't hear it changed to orange.

1330
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,320
(Even with the perfect chance, they blew it and lost 2:0)

1331
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:56,390
It changed to orange?

1332
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:58,105
- It really changed to orange? - You're out.

1333
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,860
The result of "Time-out Shooting",

1334
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:04,230
Jae Suk, Jong Kook, So Min,

1335
00:51:04,231 --> 00:51:05,630
and Se Chan win with the score of 2:0.

1336
00:51:05,632 --> 00:51:06,630
(The M Agents and Jong Kook win and get a hint!)

1337
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:07,730
Let's hear the hint.

1338
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,870
The winning team will vote to choose who will take a look at the hint.

1339
00:51:10,871 --> 00:51:12,900
We need to vote?

1340
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,500
What if we all get one vote each?

1341
00:51:14,508 --> 00:51:17,540
Don't vote for someone who's been acting like a spy.

1342
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,555
I think Jae Suk would've been given...

1343
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:23,150
a special role for a special episode.

1344
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,010
It'd be weird if they left him alone without an assignment.

1345
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:28,820
Jong Kook also speaks English well.

1346
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:29,890
It'd be Tom and Yu.

1347
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:31,805
He can't get to Tom Cruise either.

1348
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:34,775
What I can say for sure is that Se Chan is a regular R Agent.

1349
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:36,730
Se Chan is just an R Agent.

1350
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,790
(There's no way they gave a special role to someone so insignificant.)

1351
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:39,490
You write down who'll receive the hint, right?

1352
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:43,115
(M Agents have finished voting.)

1353
00:51:44,004 --> 00:51:46,570
The person with the most vote...

1354
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:48,285
is So Min.

1355
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:49,840
(Acting surprised)

1356
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:52,440
I knew it. There are two M agents there, and they voted for her.

1357
00:51:52,446 --> 00:51:53,540
Really?

1358
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,310
They gave her the votes.

1359
00:51:55,315 --> 00:51:57,595
(How did they know?)

1360
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:00,635
You can choose between a hint on one of the...

1361
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:02,995
M Agents A, B, C and the R Leader.

1362
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,520
Choose which one you want to see out of the four options.

1363
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:05,590
R Leader!

1364
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:06,590
(She chooses R Leader, of course.)

1365
00:52:06,593 --> 00:52:07,690
M.

1366
00:52:07,694 --> 00:52:10,960
(What is the hint regarding their target, R Leader?)

1367
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:15,615
(The leader was born on an even numbered month.)

1368
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:17,770
This is difficult.

1369
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:19,615
(The potential Leaders are Suk Jin, Ji Hyo, Haha, and Jong Kook.)

1370
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:22,070
Now we will move to the location of the final mission.

1371
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:24,310
You will divide up into three cars to get to your destination...

1372
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,440
to figure out whether or not the others are spies.

1373
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:27,880
- Three different cars? - Three different cars?

1374
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:29,095
They want us to look into each other.

1375
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,750
You can choose whom you'll ride with.

1376
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:32,465
(It's their final chance before meeting a senior agent of M Agency.)

1377
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,480
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Se Chan get in one car.)

1378
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:36,235
Who do you suspect the most?

1379
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,150
- I want to know your opinion. - In my opinion,

1380
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,590
- So Min is suspicious. - I see.

1381
00:52:41,595 --> 00:52:43,360
- While I suspect So Min... - Yes.

1382
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,060
I suspect Jae Suk at the same time.

1383
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:48,915
If Jae Suk wasn't an M Agent,

1384
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:51,385
he wouldn't have voted for So Min.

1385
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:54,040
- If he wasn't an M Agent, right? - Right.

1386
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,440
I don't think he would've voted for So Min.

1387
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:57,310
So let's leave out Jae Suk for now.

1388
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,370
Let's think about Kwang Soo.

1389
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:00,780
(I suspect Kwang Soo...)

1390
00:53:00,781 --> 00:53:02,110
- You suspect Kwang Soo? - Yes.

1391
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:03,150
Why do you think that?

1392
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,580
I think it'd be weird for him to be out of the picture...

1393
00:53:05,585 --> 00:53:07,720
on a stage as big as this. It's not like Running Man to do that.

1394
00:53:07,721 --> 00:53:08,965
That's right.

1395
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,965
Haha is weird today, too.

1396
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:13,360
When Haha receives directions,

1397
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,635
he acts like it's too difficult for him.

1398
00:53:15,662 --> 00:53:16,960
On that day? You're right.

1399
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:18,860
He says, "I'm having a really bad day today."

1400
00:53:18,865 --> 00:53:20,500
He's said that a lot today.

1401
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,060
When I saw him saying things like that so often today,

1402
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:27,040
it made me suspect him a bit.

1403
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,940
Or I think that he may be...

1404
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:33,025
the R Leader, too.

1405
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:34,555
- Haha? - Yes.

1406
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:37,650
Since Tom Cruise is coming today...

1407
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:38,650
(Vehicle of the people from R Agency)

1408
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:40,965
- I'd like to show some teamwork. - Me too.

1409
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:42,220
Be honest, what are you?

1410
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:43,820
I'm just an R Agent.

1411
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:45,135
I really got nothing else today.

1412
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:46,790
How can I trust him?

1413
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:47,960
It's because...

1414
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:50,630
Put something on collateral before you talk.

1415
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,960
I'll give everything I have.

1416
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:54,560
If you lie today,

1417
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:56,115
I'll tell people who your celebrity ex-girlfriends were...

1418
00:53:56,236 --> 00:53:57,485
on social media.

1419
00:53:58,338 --> 00:53:59,330
(You're seriously bringing that up?)

1420
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:00,940
You want to do that?

1421
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:03,385
I'm serious. If it isn't a lie, you should be able to do that.

1422
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,655
- Seriously, what are you doing? - What?

1423
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,110
- Are you a spy? - Okay, post it if you want.

1424
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:08,210
- Fine. - I'll really do it.

1425
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:09,440
Do it if I'm lying.

1426
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:10,950
- Okay, I'll really do it. - What are you?

1427
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:12,750
I'm the R Leader.

1428
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:13,820
(I'll be honest with you since you were honest with me.)

1429
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,020
- Really? - I'm telling you because...

1430
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,290
you told me that you were an R Agent.

1431
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,535
If you're not the R Leader,

1432
00:54:19,025 --> 00:54:20,505
I'll post the same on you.

1433
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,005
Who?

1434
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:23,060
Your...

1435
00:54:23,063 --> 00:54:25,175
(Way back then...)

1436
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,815
I'm married.

1437
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,445
I'll just post the initials.

1438
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:33,170
It wouldn't matter if you're not lying.

1439
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:35,385
If you're lying, I'm posting pictures too.

1440
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:37,010
Okay.

1441
00:54:37,010 --> 00:54:38,440
When this episode is over,

1442
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:40,710
I'll just post a picture...

1443
00:54:40,714 --> 00:54:41,925
instead of a name.

1444
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:45,425
Dear viewers, if Kwang Soo is lying...

1445
00:54:45,485 --> 00:54:47,035
I will post a picture of the person...

1446
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:49,320
you are unaware of.

1447
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:50,390
If he's lying.

1448
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,405
Then I will...

1449
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:54,075
his is not a celebrity.

1450
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:57,090
(She's not a celebrity.)

1451
00:54:57,097 --> 00:54:59,405
But Dong Hoon...

1452
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,730
Although his wife...

1453
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,615
is his first love...

1454
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:07,155
I don't know what I'm saying.

1455
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,500
I don't know!

1456
00:55:08,508 --> 00:55:10,610
I'll do it! I'll post it too!

1457
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,670
(This car is filled with disclosures.)

1458
00:55:11,678 --> 00:55:13,025
Okay.

1459
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,210
If this guy is not an R Agent...

1460
00:55:15,215 --> 00:55:17,165
Stop it!

1461
00:55:17,717 --> 00:55:18,880
Please stop it!

1462
00:55:18,885 --> 00:55:20,150
(The car goes to the final destination.)

1463
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,520
It'd be fine if you're an R Agent.

1464
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:22,965
- I am. - You are, right?

1465
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,760
Now you are at the final destination.

1466
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,860
- Yes. - We are.

1467
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:31,230
You are only given one hour.

1468
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:33,600
I'll explain the rules of the final round with three hints on the line.

1469
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,570
The game is "Mission Impossible: Three Battles".

1470
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,730
(Final mission of Catch the Spy, "Mission Impossible")

1471
00:55:38,738 --> 00:55:41,655
The three guests who are senior agents of M Agency are...

1472
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:45,440
(Henry Cavill with fatally good looks.)

1473
00:55:45,445 --> 00:55:47,680
(Simon Pegg with a crazy mouth)

1474
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:50,595
(Tom Cruise, world's number one)

1475
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:52,380
(It's an unbelievable lineup of 3 senior agents from M Agency.)

1476
00:55:52,385 --> 00:55:55,120
The three guests, who are senior agents of the M Agency...

1477
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,490
are aware of who the spies are.

1478
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,905
(The guests know who they are.)

1479
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,290
If the senior agents win,

1480
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:04,630
the hint regarding the R Leader will be given to the spies.

1481
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:05,730
(If the three senior agents win, the spies will receive a hint.)

1482
00:56:05,732 --> 00:56:07,960
On the other hand, if the senior agents lose...

1483
00:56:07,968 --> 00:56:09,500
a hint on the M Agency spies...

1484
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:11,770
will be given to the R Agents.

1485
00:56:11,771 --> 00:56:13,715
(If the senior agents lose, the R Agents will receive a hint.)

1486
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,100
We don't even know who the Leader is yet.

1487
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:18,110
We were so distracted by meeting Tom Cruise...

1488
00:56:18,111 --> 00:56:19,940
we all forgot the rules today.

1489
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:21,880
It's making me nervous for no reason.

1490
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:24,450
Honestly, Tom Cruise is...

1491
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:26,750
someone whose movies have...

1492
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:29,820
- been with me since my childhood. - It's true.

1493
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:31,590
- Starting from "Cocktail"... - That's right, "Cocktail".

1494
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:33,420
- to "Top Gun"! - "Top Gun"!

1495
00:56:33,426 --> 00:56:34,460
("Top Gun" made Tom Cruise into an action star.)

1496
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:37,130
From "Mission impossible" to...

1497
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,130
- He was in "A Few Good Men", right? - That's right.

1498
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:41,800
You guys are absolutely right.

1499
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,570
I watched many of his films.

1500
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,185
He's our enemy today.

1501
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:48,740
He's an enemy to R Agents, right?

1502
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,610
- No, he's a guest. - Is he a guest?

1503
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,070
We're getting instructions, so put your earphones on.

1504
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,280
They just criticized you. There was an instruction.

1505
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:57,880
- I'm glad I didn't hear it. - You need to watch your mouth.

1506
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:00,365
- That's what they said. - All right.

1507
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,690
Henry Cavill will be here as well.

1508
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,750
- "Man of Steel". - Right.

1509
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:07,760
- He's Superman. - He is.

1510
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:09,790
Henry was born in the Year of the Pig in 1983.

1511
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:11,690
- The Year of the Pig? - Yes, 1983.

1512
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:15,560
I'm the most worried about So Min right now.

1513
00:57:15,568 --> 00:57:18,730
She's very interested in Henry.

1514
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:20,040
Don't be interested in him.

1515
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,155
What will you do if he looks at you?

1516
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:25,170
He makes eye contact with you. What will you do?

1517
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:27,180
- He makes eye contact with you. - Hi.

1518
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,840
(Winking)

1519
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:33,920
(Hi, Henry. I'm Jeon.)

1520
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,690
I hate that.

1521
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,090
He'll think you're cute though.

1522
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:41,590
That's fine,

1523
00:57:41,594 --> 00:57:46,130
but the securities might use the taser on her.

1524
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:48,515
There's a small chance.

1525
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:52,370
- Tom Cruise is also very nice. - That's the general impression.

1526
00:57:52,372 --> 00:57:54,440
He shakes everybody's hands.

1527
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:56,540
I'll shake his hand as the representative.

1528
00:57:56,543 --> 00:57:57,840
(He's too kind, so it might take too long.)

1529
00:57:57,844 --> 00:57:59,570
- What? - What are you talking about?

1530
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:01,880
- What do you mean? - You're not funny.

1531
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:04,080
- He'll shake everybody's hands. - When will I get another chance?

1532
00:58:04,084 --> 00:58:06,310
We can make a line here.

1533
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,320
And as you know,

1534
00:58:09,322 --> 00:58:11,390
when we invite superstars on our show,

1535
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:13,660
- some people try to take pictures. - Let's not do that.

1536
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,860
- Let's not do that. - Who brought their phone?

1537
00:58:15,862 --> 00:58:16,860
(Me)

1538
00:58:16,863 --> 00:58:18,860
I have mine.

1539
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:21,500
- Don't take it from us. - We won't take pictures with him.

1540
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:24,070
- We won't do it. - Give it to me.

1541
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,770
Is this the reserve forces? Why would you take it from us?

1542
00:58:25,772 --> 00:58:28,440
Who are you? What's your role?

1543
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:32,040
I'm rearranging the situation.

1544
00:58:32,045 --> 00:58:33,980
- What do you mean? - Who are you to do that?

1545
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,840
- Fine. - Give it to me.

1546
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,550
- He's the homeroom teacher. - Are you the manager?

1547
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,635
Everybody, they're waiting for us.

1548
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:43,465
- Do we finally get to see them? - Are they really here?

1549
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:44,865
All right.

1550
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:46,450
Are they coming?

1551
00:58:46,459 --> 00:58:49,835
Finally, it's time to welcome them.

1552
00:58:50,964 --> 00:58:53,275
- Senior agents, come on out. - I'm excited.

1553
00:58:54,334 --> 00:58:56,660
I'm excited to see Tom Cruise...

1554
00:58:56,669 --> 00:58:58,115
Henry Cavill, and Simon Pegg.

1555
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:02,270
I spent my school years watching Tom Cruise's films,

1556
00:59:02,275 --> 00:59:03,985
- and I still watch them. - Exactly.

1557
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:05,825
- What's that? - He's there.

1558
00:59:08,314 --> 00:59:10,865
(Cheering)

1559
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,980
(Simon Pegg is indispensable in the film.)

1560
00:59:14,988 --> 00:59:17,490
(Tom Cruise is an action film genius.)

1561
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,550
(Henry Cavill is every woman's heartthrob.)

1562
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,690
(The real ones are here.)

1563
00:59:22,695 --> 00:59:25,690
(What's up, Running Man?)

1564
00:59:25,698 --> 00:59:28,305
(Tom Cruise from M Agency is in Korea to catch the R Leader.)

1565
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:34,740
(The real ones are here.)

1566
00:59:34,741 --> 00:59:37,740
(What's up, Running Man?)

1567
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:40,280
(Tom Cruise from M Agency is in Korea to catch the R Leader.)

1568
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,610
Henry.

1569
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:44,210
(They can't stop gaping. Is this for real?)

1570
00:59:44,217 --> 00:59:46,980
(They forget about their dignity in 3 seconds.)

1571
00:59:46,986 --> 00:59:48,650
- Nice to meet you. - Henry.

1572
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:50,250
- It's very nice to meet you. - Hi.

1573
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:52,920
Nice to meet you.

1574
00:59:52,926 --> 00:59:54,520
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - How are you?

1575
00:59:54,527 --> 00:59:56,690
- Hi, Simon. - Hello.

1576
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:58,690
- That's me. - How are you?

1577
00:59:58,698 --> 01:00:00,660
(Did I just shake their hands?)

1578
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:02,860
(I'm not going to wash my hands.)

1579
01:00:02,869 --> 01:00:04,445
We shook hands.

1580
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:08,500
- Brother Tom. - Hello. How are you? Ready?

1581
01:00:08,508 --> 01:00:10,000
- Yes, I'm ready. - Let's do it.

1582
01:00:10,009 --> 01:00:11,285
Cavill.

1583
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:14,280
(It looks like a reunion of a separated family.)

1584
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,310
(This is unbelievable.)

1585
01:00:15,315 --> 01:00:17,380
- Hello. - My heart is pounding.

1586
01:00:17,383 --> 01:00:20,025
Hello.

1587
01:00:20,386 --> 01:00:21,450
- Hello. - Thank you.

1588
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:22,820
(They're world-class sweet guys.)

1589
01:00:22,822 --> 01:00:24,065
Shall we sit?

1590
01:00:24,157 --> 01:00:26,390
I don't want to show bad manners, so I can't even express how I feel.

1591
01:00:26,392 --> 01:00:29,160
He just stood up and sat back down.

1592
01:00:29,162 --> 01:00:30,190
(M Agency and R Agency are in the same room.)

1593
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:33,405
He's our boss, Tom Cruise.

1594
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:35,530
Tom Cruise!

1595
01:00:35,535 --> 01:00:36,970
Thank you very much. Thank you.

1596
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,605
(Thank you so much.)

1597
01:00:40,506 --> 01:00:43,115
- Thank you. - He's my brother.

1598
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:45,245
- He's our brother. - My brother.

1599
01:00:46,412 --> 01:00:49,180
Next is Henry Cavill.

1600
01:00:49,182 --> 01:00:50,310
(Henry Cavill is the youngest agent in M Agency.)

1601
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:51,410
Superman.

1602
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:56,095
We respect you.

1603
01:00:56,589 --> 01:00:57,990
My gosh. He's so handsome.

1604
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:01,120
- He's the oldest agent. - He's my style.

1605
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,635
Simon Pegg.

1606
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:05,790
Nice.

1607
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:07,135
I feel good.

1608
01:01:07,567 --> 01:01:10,200
Simon said, "I feel good."

1609
01:01:10,203 --> 01:01:11,900
- Yes. - "I feel good."

1610
01:01:11,905 --> 01:01:14,500
These three actors have joined us today.

1611
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:18,010
Please say hi to the Korean viewers.

1612
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:20,540
First of all, congratulations on your show.

1613
01:01:20,546 --> 01:01:24,050
We're very, very happy to be here. It's a great show.

1614
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,880
We're very excited to be here, so thank you.

1615
01:01:25,885 --> 01:01:28,150
This is my ninth time being in Korea.

1616
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:31,090
I'm very excited to be here as always.

1617
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,620
- That's right. - Thank you. We love it here.

1618
01:01:33,626 --> 01:01:36,190
This is my first time here in Korea.

1619
01:01:36,195 --> 01:01:38,430
- It's his first time. - His first time.

1620
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,060
- Yes. - I'm incredibly excited to be here.

1621
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:42,860
Thank you so much for having us on the show.

1622
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:45,045
This is my second time in Korea.

1623
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:47,840
- This is his second time. - I'm enjoying it this time.

1624
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,500
I learned the love hearts.

1625
01:01:49,509 --> 01:01:51,410
Yes, yes.

1626
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:53,680
(Everybody knows the love hearts, right?)

1627
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,610
They know this.

1628
01:01:55,615 --> 01:01:57,310
- There you go. - They know this.

1629
01:01:57,317 --> 01:01:59,550
- You got to do this. - I can't believe they know this.

1630
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:00,720
They know this.

1631
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,695
- This is a new one. - There you go.

1632
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:05,020
- That's good. - This.

1633
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:06,420
That's good.

1634
01:02:06,426 --> 01:02:07,760
They know this too.

1635
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,195
Like that?

1636
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:13,030
(He makes an elbow heart too.)

1637
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:14,830
This.

1638
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:18,030
- He looks so cool. - His arms touch.

1639
01:02:18,037 --> 01:02:20,915
Let me see. Wait.

1640
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,275
There it is.

1641
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:25,270
(He searches...)

1642
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:29,510
(and takes a heart out of his back pocket.)

1643
01:02:29,515 --> 01:02:31,880
What's that? Watch.

1644
01:02:31,884 --> 01:02:33,820
(It's a heart of course.)

1645
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,095
- Hold on. - What's that?

1646
01:02:38,358 --> 01:02:41,420
They're awesome.

1647
01:02:41,427 --> 01:02:43,520
They know it all.

1648
01:02:43,529 --> 01:02:45,190
- He did this too. - They're funny.

1649
01:02:45,198 --> 01:02:46,790
This is great.

1650
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,530
This is season six...

1651
01:02:49,535 --> 01:02:52,000
- of "Mission Impossible". - Six.

1652
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:55,215
Why do you think it was able to last this long?

1653
01:02:55,508 --> 01:02:57,345
- Tom. - Him.

1654
01:02:58,644 --> 01:03:00,540
I don't question it. I'm just happy...

1655
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:03,440
that people want to see us and allow us to make it.

1656
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:06,380
It's a very extreme and a very challenging film to produce.

1657
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,650
The 1st "Mission Impossible" was the 1st film I ever produced.

1658
01:03:08,654 --> 01:03:11,720
Really? I see.

1659
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:14,420
Tom's probably too modest to say this, but I think one of...

1660
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:17,190
the things that makes these films really quite amazing...

1661
01:03:17,196 --> 01:03:19,790
is the fact that he genuinely risks his life...

1662
01:03:19,799 --> 01:03:21,730
in order to make it so thrilling.

1663
01:03:21,734 --> 01:03:23,560
- That's right. - He put his life on the line...

1664
01:03:23,569 --> 01:03:26,630
- hanging from helicopters. - That's right.

1665
01:03:26,639 --> 01:03:28,840
This one has a helicopter.

1666
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:30,370
- It has a helicopter. - Right.

1667
01:03:30,376 --> 01:03:32,270
I learned how to fly a helicopter for the film.

1668
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:34,940
- You drove by yourself? - Sure, everything.

1669
01:03:34,947 --> 01:03:38,380
Everything you see in the movie, I do it all.

1670
01:03:38,384 --> 01:03:39,810
I trained for a year and a half...

1671
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:43,025
to fly and learn how to do aerobatics in helicopters.

1672
01:03:46,225 --> 01:03:47,420
That sounds scary.

1673
01:03:47,427 --> 01:03:49,690
- Motorcycles too? - Motorcycles.

1674
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:51,430
All of it.

1675
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:53,430
Free driving the whole time.

1676
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,835
Sometimes over 100 miles per hour.

1677
01:03:56,335 --> 01:03:59,630
(The highlight of this film is the chasing scene on the road.)

1678
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:02,840
(Tom Cruise drove the motorcycle himself.)

1679
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:05,940
Computer graphics is really advanced now,

1680
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:09,310
so that's what we thought you'd use. Why do you do it yourself?

1681
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:11,710
You can see when it's computer graphics.

1682
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:14,980
There's a difference. You see the difference when you see...

1683
01:04:14,987 --> 01:04:18,390
films with computer graphic images. They're cartoons. They're not real.

1684
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:21,520
What I'm interested in is how can I engage an audience? How can I...

1685
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:24,130
get them not to just watch the film, but experience the movie,

1686
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,460
and to feel the movie.

1687
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:28,330
Henry, did you shoot the gun...

1688
01:04:28,334 --> 01:04:30,030
in the helicopter yourself?

1689
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:32,730
I do. Oh, yes.

1690
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:34,500
He brings his own machine gun.

1691
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:36,570
You brought your own gun?

1692
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:37,940
No, I didn't.

1693
01:04:37,944 --> 01:04:40,115
(Apparently he even brought his own machine gun.)

1694
01:04:40,546 --> 01:04:43,180
Me? I do as much as I can, but...

1695
01:04:43,182 --> 01:04:46,525
I mostly just... My life is put in enough danger by him,

1696
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,080
so anything else beyond that, I just stop.

1697
01:04:49,088 --> 01:04:50,490
"Okay, I'll take it."

1698
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,425
(Safety first.)

1699
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:54,990
Do we have any questions for them?

1700
01:04:54,994 --> 01:04:59,190
So Min, do you have a question? Anything for Cavill?

1701
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:01,860
(He stares at her.)

1702
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:03,330
You ask.

1703
01:05:03,336 --> 01:05:04,530
(She's shy.)

1704
01:05:04,537 --> 01:05:05,630
(What is wrong with her?)

1705
01:05:05,638 --> 01:05:07,900
I can't think. I'm so shy.

1706
01:05:07,907 --> 01:05:10,370
What about you, Ji Hyo?

1707
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:15,880
I want to know if you three are good friends.

1708
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:17,710
(Good friends?)

1709
01:05:17,717 --> 01:05:20,025
We're just too nervous.

1710
01:05:20,186 --> 01:05:21,820
- I'm so nervous. - Yes.

1711
01:05:21,821 --> 01:05:24,220
Yes, we're great friends.

1712
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,990
It's... We worked together for 12 months,

1713
01:05:27,994 --> 01:05:30,190
and especially when you do stunts... I mean,

1714
01:05:30,196 --> 01:05:33,560
my life was in Tom's hands for 12 months,

1715
01:05:33,566 --> 01:05:34,800
and you...

1716
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,075
I don't like these guys.

1717
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,900
(I don't like Henry.)

1718
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:42,740
He's right though. I'm making that up about him.

1719
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,985
Tom I like. Simon not so much.

1720
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:47,740
(They must be great friends.)

1721
01:05:47,747 --> 01:05:49,515
(We're close.)

1722
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:51,255
I have a question.

1723
01:05:51,284 --> 01:05:53,480
How do you get in shape?

1724
01:05:53,486 --> 01:05:55,080
- And... - I'm curious.

1725
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:57,490
- Cavill... - For the film.

1726
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,065
Did you work out this time in Korea?

1727
01:06:00,893 --> 01:06:02,390
It's...

1728
01:06:02,395 --> 01:06:04,190
- Only Henry? - Yes.

1729
01:06:04,197 --> 01:06:05,360
Hush, you.

1730
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:06,865
He's talking about people in shape.

1731
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:10,200
They're like us.

1732
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:11,630
- They're similar to us. - "Stop it."

1733
01:06:11,637 --> 01:06:13,045
They're like us.

1734
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:14,670
We're similar.

1735
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:16,840
(Shall we start the mission between Team R and M?)

1736
01:06:16,842 --> 01:06:19,940
We don't have that much time...

1737
01:06:19,946 --> 01:06:22,940
- with these three. We have an hour. - Right.

1738
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,810
We feel sad about it.

1739
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:29,080
Here's the mission we prepared.

1740
01:06:29,088 --> 01:06:30,320
Here are the rules.

1741
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:32,920
Let's start Mission Impossible: Three Battles...

1742
01:06:32,925 --> 01:06:34,690
- right now. - All right.

1743
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:37,095
The first mission is Metal Box Quiz.

1744
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:40,190
With them?

1745
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:41,700
(We'll be playing Metal Box Quiz with them?)

1746
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:45,130
(You have to guess the item in the metal box.)

1747
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:47,915
(MC Yu's dramatic style is the point of this game.)

1748
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:52,170
Do you want us to play the game with these three?

1749
01:06:52,178 --> 01:06:53,610
Is this the game we're thinking about?

1750
01:06:53,613 --> 01:06:55,440
The game I lead?

1751
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:57,210
Do you want us to play that with Tom Cruise?

1752
01:06:57,216 --> 01:06:58,410
With these guys?

1753
01:06:58,417 --> 01:07:00,950
The team that gets 2 out of 3 questions right wins.

1754
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:02,580
For your information, the senior agents...

1755
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:04,390
know who the double agents are.

1756
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:07,890
If you pay attention to the results, it'll help you figure it out.

1757
01:07:07,893 --> 01:07:09,290
- Okay. - We'll know.

1758
01:07:09,295 --> 01:07:10,520
Let's get 3 out of 3.

1759
01:07:10,529 --> 01:07:12,165
Let's go. Let's get 3 out of 3.

1760
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:15,330
Simon Pegg is first one up.

1761
01:07:15,334 --> 01:07:17,060
Please pick your opponent.

1762
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,645
Simon is up.

1763
01:07:18,804 --> 01:07:20,900
Okay, I think I'm going to choose...

1764
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:24,270
(This will be their only chance to play this game with Simon.)

1765
01:07:24,277 --> 01:07:26,340
(Which opponent will he choose?)

1766
01:07:26,345 --> 01:07:29,210
Lee.

1767
01:07:29,215 --> 01:07:31,050
Me?

1768
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:32,310
Okay.

1769
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:33,610
(Let's do this.)

1770
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:35,455
I like working with tall people.

1771
01:07:35,488 --> 01:07:36,795
Let's do this.

1772
01:07:37,156 --> 01:07:38,220
Good luck.

1773
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:39,520
(Tom steps up.)

1774
01:07:39,525 --> 01:07:40,660
Me too.

1775
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,190
You are similar to him.

1776
01:07:42,194 --> 01:07:43,735
You're Asian Prince.

1777
01:07:44,397 --> 01:07:45,905
All right. Let's go.

1778
01:07:46,065 --> 01:07:47,700
Who are all these people suddenly?

1779
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,630
Simon and Kwang Soo...

1780
01:07:49,635 --> 01:07:51,400
have to guess what's in this.

1781
01:07:51,404 --> 01:07:52,705
(It's a game between the Korean and British princes.)

1782
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:54,470
- Ready. - Yes.

1783
01:07:54,473 --> 01:07:55,600
(They're serious.)

1784
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:56,900
- Ready? - Yes, I'm ready.

1785
01:07:56,909 --> 01:07:58,170
I'm ready.

1786
01:07:58,177 --> 01:07:59,840
He sounds nervous.

1787
01:07:59,845 --> 01:08:02,315
- I can hear his heartbeat. - I can't...

1788
01:08:02,615 --> 01:08:05,380
believe we're playing this with them.

1789
01:08:05,384 --> 01:08:08,150
It's funny seeing you two next to each other.

1790
01:08:08,154 --> 01:08:09,595
- Ready. - Here we go.

1791
01:08:11,624 --> 01:08:14,890
(In the first metal box...)

1792
01:08:14,894 --> 01:08:17,390
(is a broccoli.)

1793
01:08:17,396 --> 01:08:18,690
(Who will recognize it first?)

1794
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:20,905
It'll be fast, so you have to watch carefully.

1795
01:08:21,267 --> 01:08:22,300
(They're focused.)

1796
01:08:22,301 --> 01:08:23,330
I see something.

1797
01:08:23,336 --> 01:08:24,630
Can we do this to Simon?

1798
01:08:24,637 --> 01:08:25,830
Hurry up.

1799
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:27,340
(He talks about something else.)

1800
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:29,500
(Here he goes again.)

1801
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:31,215
- Hurry. - We can't do this to Simon.

1802
01:08:31,444 --> 01:08:33,045
- They're world stars. - I got my super hero pose.

1803
01:08:33,746 --> 01:08:35,010
Hurry up.

1804
01:08:35,014 --> 01:08:37,010
(This is Korean humor. They start again.)

1805
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,280
It's nothing. It's a...

1806
01:08:38,284 --> 01:08:40,050
(He can barely see it.)

1807
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:41,755
- It's nothing. - There's nothing in there. Hang on.

1808
01:08:42,655 --> 01:08:44,090
It's in a shelf that's above...

1809
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,320
(The metal box show time begins.)

1810
01:08:46,325 --> 01:08:47,990
(Flinching)

1811
01:08:47,993 --> 01:08:49,435
What is this madness?

1812
01:08:49,595 --> 01:08:51,635
- Don't come forward. - I saw it.

1813
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:53,290
(Simon's eyes move back and forth.)

1814
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:54,575
It's a box.

1815
01:08:55,768 --> 01:08:57,645
You came too close.

1816
01:08:58,504 --> 01:09:01,140
(He inches forward.)

1817
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,470
Sorry. Sorry.

1818
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:05,170
You came up too much.

1819
01:09:05,177 --> 01:09:06,645
(That's not how you play this game.)

1820
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:10,115
(Laughing)

1821
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:11,850
He likes it too.

1822
01:09:11,851 --> 01:09:13,980
Tom likes it.

1823
01:09:13,986 --> 01:09:16,150
- People like it worldwide. - Let's go. Yes.

1824
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:17,395
(Tom is focused on the game.)

1825
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:19,765
I'm going to take this out.

1826
01:09:20,726 --> 01:09:22,135
(Turning)

1827
01:09:24,196 --> 01:09:25,660
(I saw something.)

1828
01:09:25,664 --> 01:09:26,890
It's a wasabi.

1829
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:28,275
What?

1830
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,460
- Answer. - Answer?

1831
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:31,530
(Kwang Soo sounds confident.)

1832
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:35,175
(This is his only chance to beat the heroes of "Mission Impossible".)

1833
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,770
Chewed gum.

1834
01:09:36,776 --> 01:09:38,385
(He's confident.)

1835
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:41,840
- Watch your pronunciation. - Be careful.

1836
01:09:41,847 --> 01:09:42,980
- The gum. - Wrong.

1837
01:09:42,982 --> 01:09:44,510
You're incorrect.

1838
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:45,985
- It's green... - Watch carefully.

1839
01:09:46,285 --> 01:09:47,480
- Yes, it's green. - Yes.

1840
01:09:47,486 --> 01:09:49,295
(They know it's green.)

1841
01:09:49,655 --> 01:09:50,895
Okay.

1842
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:53,225
What's that?

1843
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:56,135
(They're annoyed.)

1844
01:09:56,829 --> 01:09:59,465
(They crawl to it.)

1845
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:05,045
(Simon is mad at MC Yu's tricks. He crawls on all fours.)

1846
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:06,500
(At that moment)

1847
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:08,140
It's a broccoli! It's broccoli!

1848
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:09,875
(He finds out.)

1849
01:10:10,476 --> 01:10:13,010
(It's a broccoli!)

1850
01:10:13,012 --> 01:10:14,355
Correct.

1851
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,640
Broccoli is correct!

1852
01:10:15,648 --> 01:10:16,710
- It's correct? - Yes.

1853
01:10:16,715 --> 01:10:18,110
- It's really broccoli? - Yes.

1854
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:19,680
- Really? - It's broccoli.

1855
01:10:19,685 --> 01:10:20,680
(Great job.)

1856
01:10:20,686 --> 01:10:21,680
It came out of the thing.

1857
01:10:21,687 --> 01:10:23,580
- It's broccoli. - It's my favorite food.

1858
01:10:23,589 --> 01:10:24,965
Thank you.

1859
01:10:25,424 --> 01:10:26,920
(It's my favorite food.)

1860
01:10:26,926 --> 01:10:28,995
(Thank you.)

1861
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:30,535
Broccoli.

1862
01:10:30,696 --> 01:10:32,135
Why did you eat that?

1863
01:10:33,499 --> 01:10:34,730
Did you see Simon?

1864
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:36,130
He just ate the broccoli.

1865
01:10:36,135 --> 01:10:38,005
He was so happy to get the question right.

1866
01:10:38,637 --> 01:10:40,845
That's good Korean broccoli. It is.

1867
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:43,670
Have you played this game before?

1868
01:10:43,676 --> 01:10:45,540
Are there games like this in America?

1869
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:47,240
That's the first time I've seen that game.

1870
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:48,680
No, I've never seen this before.

1871
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:49,880
There's nothing like this in the world.

1872
01:10:49,882 --> 01:10:51,480
There's nothing like this in the world, okay?

1873
01:10:51,484 --> 01:10:53,350
That's right. This is only in Korea.

1874
01:10:53,352 --> 01:10:55,050
We only play the game here.

1875
01:10:55,054 --> 01:10:56,250
(It became a Korean traditional game on variety shows.)

1876
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,720
- Henry is next. - Yes.

1877
01:10:57,723 --> 01:10:59,250
Go, Henry. Go, buddy.

1878
01:10:59,258 --> 01:11:00,750
You're going to win. Come on.

1879
01:11:00,759 --> 01:11:02,095
Let's go, Henry.

1880
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:04,430
You have to choose an opponent.

1881
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:06,935
(My opponent is...)

1882
01:11:07,132 --> 01:11:09,305
(They're nervous.)

1883
01:11:10,102 --> 01:11:11,270
Is it Jun?

1884
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:13,505
(He considered it carefully.)

1885
01:11:13,639 --> 01:11:15,670
You? It's So Min.

1886
01:11:15,674 --> 01:11:18,085
(Henry said, "Jun".)

1887
01:11:19,044 --> 01:11:20,170
Thank you.

1888
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:21,380
(She smiles with her eyes.)

1889
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:22,710
Thank you.

1890
01:11:22,715 --> 01:11:24,710
(That shook her heart.)

1891
01:11:24,717 --> 01:11:25,910
- Thank you. - So Min.

1892
01:11:25,918 --> 01:11:27,780
We're playing a game.

1893
01:11:27,786 --> 01:11:29,895
- This is competition. - It's a game.

1894
01:11:30,256 --> 01:11:32,820
(It looks like they already won.)

1895
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:34,090
Please shake hands.

1896
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:35,695
She's smiling strangely.

1897
01:11:35,895 --> 01:11:37,560
Why are you doing that with your eyes?

1898
01:11:37,563 --> 01:11:38,790
(Her eyes have a problem.)

1899
01:11:38,797 --> 01:11:41,100
It's different from when you say hi to us.

1900
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,130
She looks so happy. She crinkled her nose.

1901
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:45,100
You never smile like that.

1902
01:11:45,104 --> 01:11:46,330
I've...

1903
01:11:46,338 --> 01:11:48,200
- never seen you making that face. - Why are you smiling like that?

1904
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:50,070
- What's wrong with her? - Focus on the game.

1905
01:11:50,075 --> 01:11:51,445
Good luck.

1906
01:11:51,877 --> 01:11:53,040
(Good luck, Henry.)

1907
01:11:53,045 --> 01:11:55,910
- What do you mean? - You're playing against him.

1908
01:11:55,915 --> 01:11:57,115
Good luck.

1909
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:59,255
- You're not on the same team. - She looks so happy.

1910
01:11:59,285 --> 01:12:00,550
- He's an opponent. - Ready.

1911
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:03,225
(They get suspicious of So Min.)

1912
01:12:03,389 --> 01:12:05,190
(The second item...)

1913
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,835
(is a whistle.)

1914
01:12:08,127 --> 01:12:09,290
Here we go.

1915
01:12:09,295 --> 01:12:10,490
(The second game starts.)

1916
01:12:10,496 --> 01:12:11,790
Henry is doing this.

1917
01:12:11,797 --> 01:12:13,065
(He's focused.)

1918
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:17,600
Good job.

1919
01:12:17,603 --> 01:12:18,630
It's fancy.

1920
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:19,905
(Jae Suk moves fast from the beginning.)

1921
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:22,770
Superman can't see everything.

1922
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,170
Use your X-ray vision.

1923
01:12:24,176 --> 01:12:26,385
Yes, use the x-ray vision. Come on.

1924
01:12:26,745 --> 01:12:28,615
It was yellow.

1925
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:30,215
It's yellow.

1926
01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:32,410
Is it a bottle opener?

1927
01:12:32,418 --> 01:12:33,780
A bottle opener?

1928
01:12:33,786 --> 01:12:34,980
Incorrect.

1929
01:12:34,987 --> 01:12:36,755
I'll throw off the lid.

1930
01:12:37,056 --> 01:12:39,050
All right. He gave it to you.

1931
01:12:39,058 --> 01:12:40,325
I'll throw off the lid.

1932
01:12:40,526 --> 01:12:42,790
(What just passed by?)

1933
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:44,705
- This is an incredible game. - You have to focus.

1934
01:12:45,064 --> 01:12:47,875
(The master gets excited by the attention he's getting.)

1935
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:49,260
Is it a key chain?

1936
01:12:49,268 --> 01:12:50,430
(He starts teasing.)

1937
01:12:50,436 --> 01:12:51,830
(He stands up.)

1938
01:12:51,837 --> 01:12:53,830
(Henry can't stand the teasing and gets up.)

1939
01:12:53,839 --> 01:12:55,340
- That's fancy. - Good job.

1940
01:12:55,341 --> 01:12:57,685
- You're a human cultural asset. - He's Korea's best MC.

1941
01:12:57,943 --> 01:12:59,945
(Peeking)

1942
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:01,740
Henry is trying so hard.

1943
01:13:01,747 --> 01:13:04,110
- Look, Henry. - What's Superman doing?

1944
01:13:04,116 --> 01:13:05,625
Oh, dear.

1945
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:08,580
(He couldn't see it,)

1946
01:13:08,587 --> 01:13:11,295
(so he uses force.)

1947
01:13:11,757 --> 01:13:14,225
(What are you doing?)

1948
01:13:14,426 --> 01:13:17,195
(This is an easy way.)

1949
01:13:17,329 --> 01:13:20,635
What are you doing?

1950
01:13:20,799 --> 01:13:22,175
It's a whistle.

1951
01:13:22,434 --> 01:13:23,660
It's a whistle.

1952
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:25,530
- He said it first. - He said it first. Sorry.

1953
01:13:25,537 --> 01:13:26,800
- Sorry. - Sorry.

1954
01:13:26,805 --> 01:13:28,100
Henry is correct.

1955
01:13:28,107 --> 01:13:29,300
(Henry Cavill wins.)

1956
01:13:29,308 --> 01:13:30,570
(So Min wasn't interested in getting it right.)

1957
01:13:30,576 --> 01:13:32,370
Let's go again.

1958
01:13:32,378 --> 01:13:34,170
Henry can't do that.

1959
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:35,740
What's the whole point of the game?

1960
01:13:35,748 --> 01:13:37,480
- Isn't this cheating? - It's cheating.

1961
01:13:37,483 --> 01:13:38,850
It's cheating.

1962
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:40,210
(Quiet)

1963
01:13:40,219 --> 01:13:41,780
He's too strong.

1964
01:13:41,787 --> 01:13:43,880
(He takes Jae Suk away from the cameras.)

1965
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:45,120
What are you doing?

1966
01:13:45,124 --> 01:13:47,090
- What's going on? - He's Jong Kook.

1967
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:49,335
- He's the American Jong Kook. - Is he Jong Kook?

1968
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:50,990
He's much stronger than Jong Kook.

1969
01:13:50,996 --> 01:13:53,290
That was cheating, but he made it natural.

1970
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:55,830
I didn't know that was the rule. You just said...

1971
01:13:55,834 --> 01:13:57,845
- You didn't say that. - I was just being in character.

1972
01:13:58,203 --> 01:13:59,700
I was being in character. August Walker.

1973
01:13:59,705 --> 01:14:01,700
(Look at these guys.)

1974
01:14:01,707 --> 01:14:03,875
- They look innocent. - We approve.

1975
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:07,185
It's the last person to go.

1976
01:14:07,246 --> 01:14:09,185
It's Tom.

1977
01:14:09,248 --> 01:14:11,825
- It's Tom. - Tom.

1978
01:14:12,885 --> 01:14:16,280
(It's finally Tom's turn to choose an opponent.)

1979
01:14:16,288 --> 01:14:17,795
Okay, Kim.

1980
01:14:18,424 --> 01:14:20,665
- Okay. - Let's go.

1981
01:14:21,427 --> 01:14:24,635
(Jong Kook is a good opponent for Tom Cruise.)

1982
01:14:25,064 --> 01:14:26,960
- Show him your body. - Let's go.

1983
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,660
He won't lose.

1984
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:29,960
I won't.

1985
01:14:29,968 --> 01:14:31,130
Jong Kook...

1986
01:14:31,136 --> 01:14:33,430
- looks happy. - Of course.

1987
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm next to him.

1988
01:14:35,007 --> 01:14:36,170
(I'm next to Tom.)

1989
01:14:36,175 --> 01:14:37,570
(They lost twice in a row, but this might be good.)

1990
01:14:37,576 --> 01:14:38,740
Let's go.

1991
01:14:38,744 --> 01:14:39,840
(They lost twice in a row, but this might be good.)

1992
01:14:39,845 --> 01:14:43,010
(Will Jong Kook win with 20 years of experience on variety shows?)

1993
01:14:43,015 --> 01:14:45,650
(Or will it be Tom, who can accomplish any mission?)

1994
01:14:45,651 --> 01:14:48,295
(This game has their pride on the line.)

1995
01:14:48,687 --> 01:14:49,750
(He's serious.)

1996
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:51,925
- This one's kind of hard. - Is it?

1997
01:14:51,957 --> 01:14:53,925
It's empty.

1998
01:14:54,193 --> 01:14:56,135
- It's on the second shelf. - It's the second shelf.

1999
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,660
It's second from...

2000
01:14:58,664 --> 01:15:00,460
(The item is on the 2nd shelf.)

2001
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:01,660
What's this?

2002
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:03,330
(Simon comes forward.)

2003
01:15:03,335 --> 01:15:04,330
What's this?

2004
01:15:04,336 --> 01:15:06,830
(What are you doing?)

2005
01:15:06,839 --> 01:15:07,840
Isn't that cheating?

2006
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,175
You can't do that.

2007
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:11,345
You're good at this.

2008
01:15:11,443 --> 01:15:13,215
Simon is really good at this.

2009
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:15,710
(Tom and Jong Kook's game continues.)

2010
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:16,880
Wait a minute. What's this?

2011
01:15:16,882 --> 01:15:18,280
You have to show us more.

2012
01:15:18,283 --> 01:15:21,380
(They're having a difficult time.)

2013
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:25,890
(They hear the familiar background music.)

2014
01:15:25,891 --> 01:15:28,195
(Singing)

2015
01:15:28,627 --> 01:15:31,705
(We still don't have a clue.)

2016
01:15:32,765 --> 01:15:35,335
(What should we do?)

2017
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:39,400
(Everyone focuses on the metal box.)

2018
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:40,500
Simon! Simon!

2019
01:15:40,506 --> 01:15:41,845
(Hurried)

2020
01:15:43,876 --> 01:15:46,170
(He moves to the back of the metal box...)

2021
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:49,040
(and gets caught.)

2022
01:15:49,047 --> 01:15:51,425
(The newbie of the variety show gets apprehended.)

2023
01:15:52,317 --> 01:15:53,755
I just wanted to see.

2024
01:15:54,419 --> 01:15:55,450
I don't know what it is.

2025
01:15:55,454 --> 01:15:56,655
(He is the British Lee Kwang Soo.)

2026
01:15:56,889 --> 01:15:59,165
(The match continues on.)

2027
01:15:59,892 --> 01:16:02,335
(Jae Suk suddenly takes off his jacket.)

2028
01:16:02,427 --> 01:16:04,635
(Tom suddenly moves as well.)

2029
01:16:04,863 --> 01:16:06,890
(Singing)

2030
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:09,460
- He is tying his shoes! - Why is he tying his shoes?

2031
01:16:09,468 --> 01:16:10,530
(This is the Metal Box Quiz.)

2032
01:16:10,536 --> 01:16:13,470
(Tom goes along with what Jae Suk does.)

2033
01:16:13,472 --> 01:16:15,500
(It's time to give a full view of what's in the metal box.)

2034
01:16:15,507 --> 01:16:16,715
Turn it over.

2035
01:16:19,178 --> 01:16:21,685
(Both of them are frustrated.)

2036
01:16:21,914 --> 01:16:23,585
What is it? Match?

2037
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:26,585
Match! I said it!

2038
01:16:27,553 --> 01:16:28,580
Correct!

2039
01:16:28,587 --> 01:16:29,650
(Tom Cruise is correct.)

2040
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:31,190
- Correct! - Match.

2041
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:33,720
(Tom Cruise gets the answer, which is a match.)

2042
01:16:33,725 --> 01:16:35,035
All right.

2043
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,935
Is match "Magic" in English?

2044
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:39,160
Why would it be "Magic"?

2045
01:16:39,164 --> 01:16:40,290
"Magic" means something entirely different.

2046
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:42,335
- Didn't he say "Magic"? - He said "Match".

2047
01:16:43,101 --> 01:16:45,005
- How did he get it right? - How did you see that?

2048
01:16:45,604 --> 01:16:47,400
How did you see that? Your eyes are like...

2049
01:16:47,406 --> 01:16:48,470
(I can't believe you got the match right.)

2050
01:16:48,473 --> 01:16:49,675
My goodness.

2051
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:50,870
How did he see it?

2052
01:16:50,876 --> 01:16:52,285
I didn't recognize it from here.

2053
01:16:53,245 --> 01:16:54,840
Give them a round of applause.

2054
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:56,010
(The senior agents of M Agency wins the first mission.)

2055
01:16:56,014 --> 01:16:58,210
- Great job. - It was hard.

2056
01:16:58,217 --> 01:16:59,210
They are good.

2057
01:16:59,218 --> 01:17:00,280
(I can't believe we lost three rounds.)

2058
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:02,180
- They are good. Respect! - Okay.

2059
01:17:02,187 --> 01:17:05,720
Since Team M won the first mission,

2060
01:17:05,724 --> 01:17:07,420
you won't receive a hint on the spies.

2061
01:17:07,426 --> 01:17:08,690
(It's good news for Jae Suk, Se Chan, and So Min.)

2062
01:17:08,694 --> 01:17:09,790
We won't receive a hint.

2063
01:17:09,795 --> 01:17:11,430
We will now move on...

2064
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,160
to the second mission.

2065
01:17:14,166 --> 01:17:15,435
(What's the second mission?)

2066
01:17:15,567 --> 01:17:18,200
Now, we will have a match...

2067
01:17:18,203 --> 01:17:19,700
against the three of them.

2068
01:17:19,705 --> 01:17:22,070
The second mission is the mystery box.

2069
01:17:22,074 --> 01:17:25,885
The one who feels and guesses the object right first wins a point.

2070
01:17:26,845 --> 01:17:29,480
Please pick your opponent.

2071
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:30,710
(The 3 senior agent pick their opponents.)

2072
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:33,285
I will pick Ji.

2073
01:17:33,352 --> 01:17:35,095
Suk Jin.

2074
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,950
(It looks like Henry will have an easy match for the 2nd time.)

2075
01:17:36,955 --> 01:17:39,065
I will pick Song.

2076
01:17:39,258 --> 01:17:40,750
Ji Hyo.

2077
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:41,920
(Simon chooses Ji Hyo.)

2078
01:17:41,927 --> 01:17:43,090
Tom.

2079
01:17:43,095 --> 01:17:45,460
Who is left here? Who is playing...

2080
01:17:45,464 --> 01:17:46,865
(Se Chan, the spy, gives him a sign.)

2081
01:17:47,232 --> 01:17:48,530
Yes. Yang.

2082
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,030
(Tom chooses Se Chan after reading his signal.)

2083
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:51,230
Thank you.

2084
01:17:51,236 --> 01:17:52,830
You will compete against Tom Cruise.

2085
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:54,940
He called me Yang. Yang.

2086
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:56,840
- Thank you. It will be fun. - Yang.

2087
01:17:56,842 --> 01:17:59,510
Simon and Ji Hyo will go first.

2088
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:00,510
(Song Ji Hyo versus Simon Pegg)

2089
01:18:00,512 --> 01:18:02,515
- It won't be easy. - It's a bit scary.

2090
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:06,285
Let's get started.

2091
01:18:06,418 --> 01:18:07,850
(Nervous)

2092
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:09,050
It's a bit scary.

2093
01:18:09,054 --> 01:18:10,655
(Do you remember how Ji Hyo did with this scary game?)

2094
01:18:10,756 --> 01:18:12,795
(Screaming)

2095
01:18:12,925 --> 01:18:16,095
(Ji Hyo screamed every time she put her hand inside.)

2096
01:18:16,194 --> 01:18:18,890
(Screaming)

2097
01:18:18,897 --> 01:18:22,735
(The Mystery Box is a screen time maker.)

2098
01:18:23,268 --> 01:18:25,345
(She is already nervous.)

2099
01:18:27,005 --> 01:18:28,915
- What is that? - What is that?

2100
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:30,070
What...

2101
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:32,285
(The content of the first box is revealed.)

2102
01:18:32,477 --> 01:18:34,445
(Pasta)

2103
01:18:34,613 --> 01:18:36,355
What will they do? This is scary.

2104
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:37,540
What will they do?

2105
01:18:37,549 --> 01:18:38,785
Are you serious?

2106
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:40,555
Don't you think you went too far?

2107
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:42,750
(He pretends to be relaxed,)

2108
01:18:42,754 --> 01:18:43,780
(but Simon is a bit nervous.)

2109
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:46,120
Guess what's inside the box.

2110
01:18:46,124 --> 01:18:47,620
This is scary.

2111
01:18:47,626 --> 01:18:49,490
This is... Go.

2112
01:18:49,494 --> 01:18:50,490
(Can Simon overcome fear?)

2113
01:18:50,495 --> 01:18:51,865
Go.

2114
01:18:52,664 --> 01:18:53,965
Be careful.

2115
01:18:54,132 --> 01:18:55,460
(Screaming)

2116
01:18:55,467 --> 01:18:56,930
(They show big reactions.)

2117
01:18:56,935 --> 01:18:58,800
- Be careful. - Oh, my goodness.

2118
01:18:58,804 --> 01:18:59,930
(What is that?)

2119
01:18:59,938 --> 01:19:01,175
What is that?

2120
01:19:01,506 --> 01:19:03,575
- Be careful. - Seriously.

2121
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:05,510
It's wet.

2122
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,540
Pasta.

2123
01:19:06,545 --> 01:19:07,885
(He blurts out the answer.)

2124
01:19:08,113 --> 01:19:10,040
(Pasta)

2125
01:19:10,048 --> 01:19:12,150
Pasta.

2126
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,210
(Simon is correct.)

2127
01:19:13,218 --> 01:19:15,550
Correct!

2128
01:19:15,554 --> 01:19:17,950
(He is relaxed.)

2129
01:19:17,956 --> 01:19:19,425
What was that?

2130
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:20,950
He isn't scared.

2131
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:22,120
He is the master of variety shows.

2132
01:19:22,127 --> 01:19:23,620
How was I supposed to get this right?

2133
01:19:23,628 --> 01:19:25,205
Don't eat it!

2134
01:19:26,431 --> 01:19:27,760
Weren't you scared?

2135
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:30,460
Yes, I was. It felt organic.

2136
01:19:30,469 --> 01:19:31,630
(Simon, the master of variety shows)

2137
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:34,815
But then it was the unmistakable shape of fusilli.

2138
01:19:35,307 --> 01:19:36,300
How did he know?

2139
01:19:36,308 --> 01:19:37,370
You know,

2140
01:19:37,376 --> 01:19:39,870
- had we done this, - We wouldn't have known.

2141
01:19:39,878 --> 01:19:42,215
we would have spent 20 minutes.

2142
01:19:42,481 --> 01:19:45,710
Simon won a point.

2143
01:19:45,717 --> 01:19:47,480
Next up is Henry.

2144
01:19:47,486 --> 01:19:48,520
(Next up is Henry Cavill.)

2145
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,880
We need to receive a hint.

2146
01:19:49,888 --> 01:19:52,225
We need to receive a hint on the spies.

2147
01:19:52,391 --> 01:19:54,090
Something scary will be inside.

2148
01:19:54,092 --> 01:19:56,390
Please tell him that. Something scary will be inside.

2149
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,790
- Yes. - Something terrible.

2150
01:19:57,796 --> 01:19:59,730
- Okay. - In 1, 2.

2151
01:19:59,731 --> 01:20:01,875
- No! - My goodness.

2152
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:03,930
(Their reactions are bigger.)

2153
01:20:03,935 --> 01:20:04,930
What will they do?

2154
01:20:04,936 --> 01:20:08,170
(What's inside the second Mystery Box?)

2155
01:20:08,173 --> 01:20:10,215
(A human hand?)

2156
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:12,885
(Let's talk about this hand.)

2157
01:20:14,546 --> 01:20:17,040
(A single touch is enough to make a member nearly faint.)

2158
01:20:17,049 --> 01:20:19,625
(It's unpleasant enough to stop the shoot.)

2159
01:20:19,985 --> 01:20:22,795
(It's ready to surprise Superman.)

2160
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:25,220
It's alive.

2161
01:20:25,223 --> 01:20:26,525
No!

2162
01:20:27,592 --> 01:20:30,495
(I didn't expect a human hand to come out.)

2163
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:31,790
(With everyone's expectations,)

2164
01:20:31,797 --> 01:20:34,560
(the match between Suk Jin and Henry starts.)

2165
01:20:34,566 --> 01:20:37,135
(Henry is takes the aggressive approach.)

2166
01:20:37,235 --> 01:20:39,605
(He makes a fuss.)

2167
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:42,845
(Henry is relaxed.)

2168
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:45,070
- What is it? It's moving. - Wait a second.

2169
01:20:45,077 --> 01:20:47,170
(Henry grabs the human hand.)

2170
01:20:47,179 --> 01:20:48,585
It's a human hand.

2171
01:20:49,548 --> 01:20:51,685
Come on!

2172
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:53,580
Come on!

2173
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:55,150
He is Jong Kook!

2174
01:20:55,153 --> 01:20:56,450
I can't believe it.

2175
01:20:56,455 --> 01:20:57,450
(This isn't how you play this game.)

2176
01:20:57,456 --> 01:20:58,825
He is Jong Kook.

2177
01:20:59,357 --> 01:21:01,120
- How... - Is it over?

2178
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:02,695
- It's over. - What's the answer?

2179
01:21:02,794 --> 01:21:03,820
What's the answer?

2180
01:21:03,829 --> 01:21:05,460
How did he know?

2181
01:21:05,464 --> 01:21:06,460
(It's more like Speed Quiz, not Mystery Box.)

2182
01:21:06,465 --> 01:21:07,590
(Good job.)

2183
01:21:07,599 --> 01:21:09,130
- We would have put... - Who is in there?

2184
01:21:09,134 --> 01:21:10,760
our hands in there...

2185
01:21:10,769 --> 01:21:12,900
- and taken 20 minutes. - Seriously.

2186
01:21:12,904 --> 01:21:16,375
Aren't you scared? You don't know what's inside.

2187
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:19,645
No, I have been in a helicopter while I was being chased by Tom.

2188
01:21:20,512 --> 01:21:23,215
(That's his secret.)

2189
01:21:23,915 --> 01:21:27,280
The last round is between Yang Se Chan and Tom Cruise.

2190
01:21:27,285 --> 01:21:29,220
- Okay. - Okay. Great. Let's go.

2191
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:32,165
- The last one. - Tom, this is a bit...

2192
01:21:32,324 --> 01:21:33,320
You have to be careful.

2193
01:21:33,325 --> 01:21:35,095
- You have to be careful. - Yes, I will be careful.

2194
01:21:36,795 --> 01:21:37,920
Oh, my goodness.

2195
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:38,960
(Even Simon is surprised.)

2196
01:21:38,964 --> 01:21:40,130
Oh, my goodness.

2197
01:21:40,132 --> 01:21:41,160
- Don't tell him. - All right.

2198
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,100
(What is it?)

2199
01:21:43,101 --> 01:21:44,130
What is it?

2200
01:21:44,136 --> 01:21:47,770
(Inside the third box is...)

2201
01:21:47,772 --> 01:21:50,475
(a moving toy snake.)

2202
01:21:51,877 --> 01:21:53,310
(What is this unpleasant sound?)

2203
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:54,915
- What is that sound? - My goodness.

2204
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,140
What is that sound?

2205
01:21:56,148 --> 01:21:57,310
This is happening for real.

2206
01:21:57,315 --> 01:21:58,685
It's alive.

2207
01:22:00,685 --> 01:22:01,780
- Ready? - Yes, I am ready.

2208
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:03,455
- It's dangerous. - Go slowly.

2209
01:22:04,256 --> 01:22:05,250
(They grab each other's hand.)

2210
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:06,620
Let go!

2211
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:08,720
(They have a passionate handshake inside the box.)

2212
01:22:08,727 --> 01:22:10,695
(This is interesting.)

2213
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:14,830
(Tom grabs the toy snake.)

2214
01:22:14,833 --> 01:22:16,630
- My goodness. - Hold on.

2215
01:22:16,635 --> 01:22:18,300
(Don't tell me...)

2216
01:22:18,303 --> 01:22:20,270
Snake toy. Toy snake.

2217
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:22,370
(He gets it right in 12 seconds.)

2218
01:22:22,374 --> 01:22:25,785
Come on!

2219
01:22:26,011 --> 01:22:28,855
(It looks like we won again.)

2220
01:22:29,047 --> 01:22:30,910
(He is cheerful.)

2221
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:33,225
- Is it over? - It's over.

2222
01:22:33,385 --> 01:22:34,780
Wasn't it above?

2223
01:22:34,786 --> 01:22:36,555
- Wasn't he scared? - We can't win once.

2224
01:22:36,855 --> 01:22:38,965
- They are really good. - He said, "Snake toy".

2225
01:22:39,457 --> 01:22:40,920
His answer was precise, too.

2226
01:22:40,926 --> 01:22:42,320
He touched it.

2227
01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:43,995
- Maybe he knew the answer. - He...

2228
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:45,990
This is frustrating.

2229
01:22:45,997 --> 01:22:47,060
(Even a real snake can't scare them.)

2230
01:22:47,065 --> 01:22:48,600
We can't win against them.

2231
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,900
They are really good at games.

2232
01:22:49,901 --> 01:22:50,930
(The last mission is revealed.)

2233
01:22:50,936 --> 01:22:54,130
The last mission is Pirate Roulette Game.

2234
01:22:54,139 --> 01:22:55,375
(Pirate Roulette Game)

2235
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,940
- Okay. - That's good.

2236
01:22:56,942 --> 01:22:59,340
The two teams will take turns...

2237
01:22:59,344 --> 01:23:00,870
inserting a sword.

2238
01:23:00,879 --> 01:23:02,680
The team that makes the pirate pop out loses.

2239
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:03,840
We might win this time.

2240
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:04,910
This is pure luck.

2241
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,380
I can't believe we are playing this game...

2242
01:23:06,384 --> 01:23:08,280
- with Tom Cruise. - Have you played...

2243
01:23:08,286 --> 01:23:09,380
this game before?

2244
01:23:09,387 --> 01:23:10,750
- Never? - Never. I have never.

2245
01:23:10,755 --> 01:23:12,050
(It's his first time seeing it.)

2246
01:23:12,057 --> 01:23:13,190
This is the last mission.

2247
01:23:13,191 --> 01:23:14,690
This is our last chance to receive a hint.

2248
01:23:14,693 --> 01:23:17,790
- That's right. - We need to receive a hint.

2249
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:20,465
Please insert a sword anywhere.

2250
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:25,205
(Tom Cruise looks out of place before the Pirate Roulette Game.)

2251
01:23:25,403 --> 01:23:27,545
(Which slot should I choose?)

2252
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,300
- Tom... - Tom is also...

2253
01:23:30,308 --> 01:23:31,745
(What's the result?)

2254
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:34,310
(Inserting)

2255
01:23:34,312 --> 01:23:35,380
Tom is also...

2256
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:37,180
(He succeeds in inserting one sword.)

2257
01:23:37,182 --> 01:23:38,425
- Safe. - Safe.

2258
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,255
It's over if the pirate pops out.

2259
01:23:40,919 --> 01:23:42,895
- Is it over if the pirate pops out? - Yes.

2260
01:23:43,588 --> 01:23:44,850
You only have one chance.

2261
01:23:44,856 --> 01:23:46,165
(I think it will pop out this time.)

2262
01:23:46,391 --> 01:23:47,750
(It's their last chance to receive a hint.)

2263
01:23:47,759 --> 01:23:49,395
It's our last chance to receive a hint.

2264
01:23:50,795 --> 01:23:52,705
(Shouting)

2265
01:23:53,431 --> 01:23:55,075
(Shouting)

2266
01:23:55,467 --> 01:23:57,830
(Simon gets used to Korean variety shows.)

2267
01:23:57,836 --> 01:23:59,345
(Simon is hilarious.)

2268
01:24:00,772 --> 01:24:02,075
(Inserting)

2269
01:24:03,441 --> 01:24:04,715
Henry, you are up.

2270
01:24:04,743 --> 01:24:07,215
- Go, Henry. Come on, Henry. - Come on.

2271
01:24:07,479 --> 01:24:09,110
Henry.

2272
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:10,385
(Childish)

2273
01:24:10,682 --> 01:24:12,080
(Henry is nervous for the first time.)

2274
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:13,880
(Is he fated to succeed?)

2275
01:24:13,885 --> 01:24:15,195
Oh, he changed his mind.

2276
01:24:15,654 --> 01:24:17,955
(Please)

2277
01:24:18,957 --> 01:24:21,125
(Inserting)

2278
01:24:22,127 --> 01:24:24,495
(Pirate Roulette Game makes the three of them happy.)

2279
01:24:24,696 --> 01:24:26,660
Let's make this interesting.

2280
01:24:26,665 --> 01:24:28,165
(Jong Kook goes next.)

2281
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:30,875
(Inserting)

2282
01:24:32,003 --> 01:24:33,500
(Is it my turn?)

2283
01:24:33,505 --> 01:24:35,500
Okay, Simon. Let's go, Simon. Come on.

2284
01:24:35,507 --> 01:24:37,870
- Simon. - Simon.

2285
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:39,285
(We have a good feeling about this, Simon.)

2286
01:24:39,444 --> 01:24:40,810
Please. Please.

2287
01:24:40,812 --> 01:24:42,585
(The British Lee Kwang Soo is bound to make the pirate pop out.)

2288
01:24:43,548 --> 01:24:45,350
- Simon. - Simon.

2289
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,780
He is funny.

2290
01:24:46,785 --> 01:24:50,095
(Let's see if Simon will make the game interesting.)

2291
01:24:50,388 --> 01:24:51,655
(Inserting)

2292
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:53,320
(He exits in a cool way.)

2293
01:24:53,325 --> 01:24:54,595
So Min.

2294
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,290
(Singing)

2295
01:24:58,296 --> 01:25:01,305
(Tom goes along with it.)

2296
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:04,535
Please.

2297
01:25:05,236 --> 01:25:07,705
(So Min succeeds.)

2298
01:25:07,839 --> 01:25:11,275
(It's Tom's turn again.)

2299
01:25:14,346 --> 01:25:17,315
(Tom gets caught.)

2300
01:25:17,415 --> 01:25:20,210
(Tom is human after all.)

2301
01:25:20,218 --> 01:25:21,485
I won!

2302
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,150
I won, right?

2303
01:25:23,154 --> 01:25:24,380
(If it pops out, I win, right?)

2304
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:26,825
Good job. Good job.

2305
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:29,995
That was incredible.

2306
01:25:30,095 --> 01:25:31,490
We won.

2307
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:33,360
That was incredible.

2308
01:25:33,365 --> 01:25:37,035
The Unlucky Club should celebrate.

2309
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:39,830
Jennie and Tom are the new additions.

2310
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:41,400
- We won, right? - Yes.

2311
01:25:41,406 --> 01:25:44,000
- No, no. - We won.

2312
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:45,470
We won.

2313
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:46,470
(R Agency wins for the first time.)

2314
01:25:46,478 --> 01:25:50,540
This time, M Agency lost.

2315
01:25:50,548 --> 01:25:51,885
We won.

2316
01:25:53,084 --> 01:25:55,010
That's their spot.

2317
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:58,250
The three of them are hilarious.

2318
01:25:58,256 --> 01:26:00,890
- They go to their spot... - They are so nice.

2319
01:26:00,892 --> 01:26:02,560
- no matter what happens. - They are so nice.

2320
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:04,190
They are so nice.

2321
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:05,190
- We are actors. - We are actors.

2322
01:26:05,196 --> 01:26:07,665
- We know to stay on our marks. - We know to stay on our marks.

2323
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:12,630
It's time to say goodbye.

2324
01:26:12,637 --> 01:26:14,870
This was so much fun.

2325
01:26:14,873 --> 01:26:18,570
Thank you. You guys are wonderful. You are absolutely wonderful.

2326
01:26:18,576 --> 01:26:21,310
Thank you all so much. It's been a lot of fun playing.

2327
01:26:21,312 --> 01:26:24,180
You guys are absolutely fantastic. It was amazing being on the show.

2328
01:26:24,182 --> 01:26:25,210
- Lovely. - It's a great show.

2329
01:26:25,216 --> 01:26:26,780
Also, who is in that box?

2330
01:26:26,785 --> 01:26:28,350
Yes. Get that person out of the box.

2331
01:26:28,353 --> 01:26:30,450
- Who is in that box? - Who is in that box?

2332
01:26:30,455 --> 01:26:31,620
(They are cheerful until the end.)

2333
01:26:31,623 --> 01:26:35,020
This was really fun. You guys are amazing.

2334
01:26:35,026 --> 01:26:36,620
- You guys are amazing. - Thank you.

2335
01:26:36,628 --> 01:26:38,790
I think I am happy because we won a lot,

2336
01:26:38,797 --> 01:26:40,860
- but... - You won a lot.

2337
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:42,030
(It's fun to win a lot.)

2338
01:26:42,033 --> 01:26:43,630
- That makes sense. - We prepared...

2339
01:26:43,635 --> 01:26:46,505
small gifts. Please wait.

2340
01:26:46,838 --> 01:26:48,900
Is it broccoli? It's not broccoli, is it?

2341
01:26:48,907 --> 01:26:50,670
(The master of variety shows makes them laugh until the end.)

2342
01:26:50,675 --> 01:26:52,085
Thank you very much.

2343
01:26:52,477 --> 01:26:54,670
(The first gift is the golden R Badge.)

2344
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:56,140
Thank you, Running Man.

2345
01:26:56,147 --> 01:26:57,910
- Excellent. - Thank you.

2346
01:26:57,916 --> 01:26:59,780
- Thank you. - That's the name tag.

2347
01:26:59,784 --> 01:27:02,080
- It's a name tag. - Tom Cruise.

2348
01:27:02,086 --> 01:27:04,750
- That's so cool. - Thank you so much!

2349
01:27:04,756 --> 01:27:06,590
- Thank you. - Excellent.

2350
01:27:06,591 --> 01:27:08,795
- Nice. - Thank you so much.

2351
01:27:09,594 --> 01:27:12,890
- Would you put it on my back? - Yes.

2352
01:27:12,897 --> 01:27:13,930
(They are touched.)

2353
01:27:13,932 --> 01:27:15,535
- My goodness. - Come on.

2354
01:27:15,834 --> 01:27:17,805
Tom Cruise.

2355
01:27:18,102 --> 01:27:20,600
Take a picture of us.

2356
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:23,170
Stop it. What are you doing?

2357
01:27:23,174 --> 01:27:25,370
- Get lost! - What are you doing?

2358
01:27:25,376 --> 01:27:26,645
Take a picture of us.

2359
01:27:28,746 --> 01:27:29,910
(The 3 senior agents finish their mission.)

2360
01:27:29,914 --> 01:27:32,485
(What are the fates of the two agencies?)

2361
01:27:34,219 --> 01:27:35,995
Following the result of the missions,

2362
01:27:36,187 --> 01:27:40,125
the spies of M Agency will receive two hints on the leader of R Agency.

2363
01:27:40,191 --> 01:27:41,320
The spies of R Agency will receive...

2364
01:27:41,326 --> 01:27:45,560
one hints on the leader of M Agency. If you go to your position and wait,

2365
01:27:45,563 --> 01:27:48,365
you will receive the hints via texts.

2366
01:27:48,466 --> 01:27:50,930
The three people who receive the most number of votes...

2367
01:27:50,935 --> 01:27:53,930
will go up the platform and get their identities checked.

2368
01:27:53,938 --> 01:27:57,000
If more than two people are the spies of M Agency,

2369
01:27:57,008 --> 01:27:59,570
R Agency will win. If the leader of R Agency is...

2370
01:27:59,577 --> 01:28:02,410
one of the chosen ones, M Agency will win.

2371
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:05,385
The winning team will receive a golden badge.

2372
01:28:05,717 --> 01:28:09,780
(So Min receives 2 hints on the leader of R Agency.)

2373
01:28:09,787 --> 01:28:12,390
(The leader has gone on a Luxury Package tour...)

2374
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,595
(and uses a stage name.)

2375
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:18,190
(Among the members who have gone to Luxury Package tour,)

2376
01:28:18,196 --> 01:28:20,290
(Haha and Ji Hyo use stage names.)

2377
01:28:20,298 --> 01:28:22,575
It's either Haha or Ji Hyo.

2378
01:28:24,035 --> 01:28:28,345
(Jae Suk, here are the hints.)

2379
01:28:28,873 --> 01:28:30,000
This is...

2380
01:28:30,008 --> 01:28:34,745
(The leader of R Agency is either Haha or Ji Hyo.)

2381
01:28:37,215 --> 01:28:38,280
Who could it be?

2382
01:28:38,283 --> 01:28:39,885
(The 2 candidates are unexpected.)

2383
01:28:40,485 --> 01:28:42,250
This is too hard.

2384
01:28:42,253 --> 01:28:46,665
(Between Haha and Ji Hyo, who is the leader of R Agency?)

2385
01:28:47,191 --> 01:28:48,190
(Among the agents of M Agency, A has a younger sister.)

2386
01:28:48,192 --> 01:28:49,990
It's Jae Suk, right?

2387
01:28:49,994 --> 01:28:51,990
- Yes. - Okay. I knew it.

2388
01:28:51,996 --> 01:28:54,165
It's exactly as we said.

2389
01:28:55,099 --> 01:28:57,330
- We have 1 agent. - 1 agent.

2390
01:28:57,335 --> 01:28:58,500
(We have one agent.)

2391
01:28:58,503 --> 01:29:00,400
- There are more. - There are B and C.

2392
01:29:00,405 --> 01:29:01,975
(Who are the rest?)

2393
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:05,070
- The person they pointed to... - That's right.

2394
01:29:05,076 --> 01:29:06,540
(They have So Min as well.)

2395
01:29:06,544 --> 01:29:09,085
- I am 100 percent sure. - Me?

2396
01:29:09,247 --> 01:29:11,255
- Me? - The other one is...

2397
01:29:11,349 --> 01:29:13,780
What are you doing?

2398
01:29:13,785 --> 01:29:15,680
(We must get the leader of R Agency on the platform.)

2399
01:29:15,687 --> 01:29:17,880
The results are in.

2400
01:29:17,889 --> 01:29:21,120
The three people with the most votes will go up the platform.

2401
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:23,190
- Yu Jae Suk. - Okay.

2402
01:29:23,194 --> 01:29:24,890
(Yu Jae Suk)

2403
01:29:24,896 --> 01:29:26,190
(This is bad.)

2404
01:29:26,197 --> 01:29:29,030
- Jun So Min. - It's obvious.

2405
01:29:29,033 --> 01:29:31,160
(She always gets caught when she is a spy.)

2406
01:29:31,169 --> 01:29:32,230
The last one is...

2407
01:29:32,236 --> 01:29:33,830
(It's obvious the agents of M Agency...)

2408
01:29:33,838 --> 01:29:36,500
(voted for either Haha or Ji Hyo.)

2409
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:38,140
- Haha. - What?

2410
01:29:38,142 --> 01:29:39,810
What? Me?

2411
01:29:39,811 --> 01:29:41,645
- Haha? - Haha?

2412
01:29:42,013 --> 01:29:43,740
(Right before the final vote)

2413
01:29:43,748 --> 01:29:45,755
It's Haha. Haha.

2414
01:29:46,551 --> 01:29:48,280
- It's Haha, right? - Yes.

2415
01:29:48,286 --> 01:29:50,450
(The 3 agents of M Agency voted for Haha.)

2416
01:29:50,455 --> 01:29:51,655
That came out of nowhere.

2417
01:29:52,957 --> 01:29:55,690
- M Agency... - That came out of nowhere.

2418
01:29:55,693 --> 01:29:56,920
(Ji Hyo avoids the platform.)

2419
01:29:56,928 --> 01:29:59,790
Let's check Jae Suk's name tag.

2420
01:29:59,797 --> 01:30:01,260
- Okay. - It's under the name tag.

2421
01:30:01,265 --> 01:30:03,600
- He has a name tag. - When did he get one?

2422
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:07,605
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

2423
01:30:08,973 --> 01:30:10,715
(Spy)

2424
01:30:12,076 --> 01:30:15,110
- That's good. - I knew you were a spy.

2425
01:30:15,113 --> 01:30:16,755
So Min.

2426
01:30:16,914 --> 01:30:18,185
I knew...

2427
01:30:18,216 --> 01:30:19,585
(Spy)

2428
01:30:19,884 --> 01:30:21,650
- So Min. - We won.

2429
01:30:21,653 --> 01:30:23,850
- We did it. - We caught two spies.

2430
01:30:23,855 --> 01:30:27,025
- Haha shouldn't be the leader. - Haha shouldn't be the leader.

2431
01:30:27,225 --> 01:30:29,090
If Haha is the leader, we win.

2432
01:30:29,093 --> 01:30:31,190
- If Haha is the leader of R Agency, - That's right.

2433
01:30:31,195 --> 01:30:33,660
- M Agency wins. - This is so confusing.

2434
01:30:33,665 --> 01:30:36,475
The hints narrowed it down to two people.

2435
01:30:37,101 --> 01:30:40,605
(Is their hunch correct?)

2436
01:30:40,972 --> 01:30:41,970
An agent of R Agency.

2437
01:30:41,973 --> 01:30:43,715
(He isn't the leader of R Agency.)

2438
01:30:44,175 --> 01:30:45,545
An agent of R Agency.

2439
01:30:45,777 --> 01:30:48,615
- We did it. - Our secret is safe.

2440
01:30:48,846 --> 01:30:52,180
(The agents' past is safe.)

2441
01:30:52,183 --> 01:30:53,980
- We did it. - Is Ji Hyo the leader?

2442
01:30:53,985 --> 01:30:56,080
- Ji Hyo is the leader. - Is Ji Hyo the leader?

2443
01:30:56,087 --> 01:30:57,655
(I am the leader of R Agency.)

2444
01:30:59,023 --> 01:31:00,250
(Leader)

2445
01:31:00,258 --> 01:31:01,820
Ji Hyo.

2446
01:31:01,826 --> 01:31:03,260
The leader.

2447
01:31:03,261 --> 01:31:05,490
- We got you. - Se Chan.

2448
01:31:05,496 --> 01:31:07,760
I can't believe it's Ji Hyo.

2449
01:31:07,765 --> 01:31:11,300
- You spy! - Se Chan must have been startled.

2450
01:31:11,302 --> 01:31:13,445
You were certain Haha is the leader.

2451
01:31:13,538 --> 01:31:17,200
I didn't trust Se Chan until the end.

2452
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:20,670
Thus, the victory goes...

2453
01:31:20,678 --> 01:31:22,010
to R Agency.

2454
01:31:22,013 --> 01:31:25,055
(The victory goes to R Agency.)

2455
01:31:26,184 --> 01:31:27,855
(Where are my shoes?)

2456
01:31:28,986 --> 01:31:30,750
(Jong Kook's shoes disappear.)

2457
01:31:30,755 --> 01:31:32,165
Are Jong Kook's shoes missing?

2458
01:31:32,457 --> 01:31:35,495
(Where are my shoes?)

2459
01:31:36,127 --> 01:31:38,390
(Jong Kook's shoes disappeared without a trace.)

2460
01:31:38,396 --> 01:31:39,990
(Who is the culprit?)

2461
01:31:39,997 --> 01:31:41,890
(Strange behaviors are spotted.)

2462
01:31:41,899 --> 01:31:43,800
(One of us is the culprit.)

2463
01:31:43,801 --> 01:31:47,145
(They narrow down the suspects.)

2464
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:50,570
(It's unwise to touch things that belong to Jong Kook.)

2465
01:31:50,575 --> 01:31:53,945
(They close in on the culprit.)

2466
01:31:53,978 --> 01:31:56,415
(Running Man desperately tries to escape suspicion.)

2467
01:31:57,014 --> 01:31:59,210
(You either get caught...)

2468
01:31:59,217 --> 01:32:01,485
(or hide.)

2469
01:32:01,586 --> 01:32:04,395
(Let's see how the suspenseful detective game ends.)

2470
01:32:04,756 --> 01:32:07,395
(The 3rd part of the Catch Project, Missing Shoes)
