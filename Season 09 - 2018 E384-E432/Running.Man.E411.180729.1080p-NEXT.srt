1
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:10,155
- What's this? - We're going inside a house.

2
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,240
Is this "All The Butlers"?

3
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:12,580
- What's this? - Is it a restaurant?

4
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:14,025
Is it really a restaurant?

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,625
- It must be a restaurant. - It's nice.

6
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:19,650
We usually open the show in the yard. This is refreshing.

7
00:00:19,656 --> 00:00:22,150
- I'll put your shoes up here. - Thank you.

8
00:00:22,158 --> 00:00:23,365
(Is the shoot inside a restaurant?)

9
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,405
Gosh, what's that? Wait.

10
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:29,075
- What is it from the start? - What is it?

11
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:31,315
There's food during the opening.

12
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:33,270
- What's going on? - This is amazing.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,570
- This is nice. - What's going on?

14
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:37,940
They're treating us well for a reason.

15
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:40,770
- Are we eating already? - No way.

16
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:43,040
What's going on? I feel pressured.

17
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,655
- What is it? - What's all this?

18
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:46,950
Can we eat?

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,380
(Come here, So Min.)

20
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:50,580
- Do we eat? - What's going on here?

21
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:51,980
(Sit next to Jong Kook.)

22
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:54,350
- What shall we do? - Everyone.

23
00:00:54,357 --> 00:00:56,550
You must be hungry since it's lunch time.

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,560
- Yes. - Yes.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Our shoots have been difficult these days.

26
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,060
We prepared a special opening for you.

27
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,260
- Right. - What's going on?

28
00:01:03,266 --> 00:01:06,730
- You'll start with a meal. - This is weird. I don't like it.

29
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,245
Do we get to eat for free?

30
00:01:09,272 --> 00:01:12,100
- There's even deodeok. - Jong Kook.

31
00:01:12,108 --> 00:01:14,110
There's no water. I'll bring some.

32
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,510
The texture of the deodeok is amazing.

33
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,925
I haven't had hot rice in a long time.

34
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:21,980
It's strange that no one is putting dried laver on their face.

35
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:24,620
Now that we're allowed to eat as much as we want,

36
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,920
- I can't eat. - Just eat.

37
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,490
- Do we have to dance? - Just enjoy it.

38
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:31,020
This is how Seok Jin eats.

39
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,190
- Do you know what he just said? - What?

40
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:34,945
If we came here alone without cameras,

41
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:37,875
he'd say, "There's a lot of food, but nothing seems appetizing."

42
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,400
(He's eating for the camera.)

43
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:42,045
That's what he'd say.

44
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,755
He complains no matter what the menu is.

45
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,025
Exactly.

46
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,210
I wonder I love jellyfish so much.

47
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,995
(He forgets about the shoot and eats with gusto.)

48
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,255
Jellyfish is delicious.

49
00:01:54,017 --> 00:01:55,310
They're writing something.

50
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,565
(Staff members are writing something.)

51
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,550
- What are they writing? - What's going on?

52
00:01:58,555 --> 00:02:01,835
- What is it? - Come on.

53
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:04,960
- What are you writing? - I don't care. I'm going to eat.

54
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,190
- I don't care. Just eat. - How can they write...

55
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:09,205
right in front of us?

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,060
They brought something to write on.

57
00:02:12,068 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm trying not to care, but as soon as I noticed that they're writing,

58
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:16,400
I can only eat what I already ate.

59
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:18,015
I'm eating deodeok.

60
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,215
Tofu is delicious.

61
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,225
- Tofu? - Tofu with kimchi is excellent.

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,080
(So Min gives him a flower.)

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,580
- It's a flower. - It's in front of you.

64
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:27,150
- Why are you giving it to me? - Just because.

65
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,850
- To me? Thank you. - Yes.

66
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:30,980
- What are you doing, So Min? - What is it?

67
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,350
What is it all of a sudden?

68
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:34,905
- I'm sitting next to him. - Out of the blue?

69
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:39,375
She likes to do things out of the blue.

70
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:43,400
- Hey, what are you doing? - I'm sorry.

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,975
(Crashing)

72
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,170
- What is it? - Is it a mission?

73
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,230
- Is it a mission? - Why did you do that?

74
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:51,970
It's because it was too far.

75
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,770
- You're being rude. - Wait, Jae Seok. It was too far.

76
00:02:54,778 --> 00:02:57,840
- It was too far. - Did you get an instruction?

77
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,425
- What's going on? - I was only eating.

78
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,565
Why did you give me a flower? It's strange.

79
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,635
- Did they give you an order? - No.

80
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:07,850
(Their suspicious meal continues.)

81
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:10,090
Can we get more braised ribs?

82
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:11,435
I ate too much.

83
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,905
Is everyone done eating?

84
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:16,675
Excuse me, is there nurungji?

85
00:03:17,867 --> 00:03:19,730
- No. - Wait a minute.

86
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:23,470
I want some more braised ribs, but I ate too much.

87
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:26,240
(A man stares at Seok Jin who goes to ask for nurungji.)

88
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:29,240
- To be honest, I want soup. - Me too.

89
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:31,240
- How about this? - Why isn't there any nurungji?

90
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:32,280
(What?)

91
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,555
What?

92
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:35,480
What happened? What did you do?

93
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,195
- What? - What's with the look?

94
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,150
(He's caught hiding something.)

95
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:41,450
Seok Jin, what's with the look?

96
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,375
- What is it? - Make up an excuse for yourself.

97
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:46,060
Make up an excuse for yourself.

98
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:49,490
- I went to the restroom. - With your rice bowl?

99
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:53,000
(Did he go to the restroom with his rice bowl?)

100
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:55,500
This is what he did as he came back in.

101
00:03:55,505 --> 00:03:58,170
(He mumbles to himself awkwardly.)

102
00:03:58,174 --> 00:03:59,740
What was that about?

103
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:02,470
This is a failure. I don't know what it is.

104
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,340
- Wait. Jong Kook. - This is a failure.

105
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:07,310
- He went to the restroom, - Seriously.

106
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:10,735
but he said, "I'll go and eat."

107
00:04:10,987 --> 00:04:14,950
He went this way instead of that way.

108
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:17,675
He came back in while talking to himself.

109
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,205
If it's Seok Jin,

110
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:21,560
let's shoot again tomorrow.

111
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:23,675
(If Seok Jin is the spy, let's shoot again tomorrow.)

112
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,100
- What's going on? - Tell us.

113
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:28,845
- You thought it was me last time. - I know.

114
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,400
I can be strange at times.

115
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:33,870
(I can be strange at times.)

116
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:34,940
That's why.

117
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:37,355
What he said was very strange.

118
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,010
What he said was very strange.

119
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:42,250
I acted normal,

120
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,880
but you thought I was being strange.

121
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,380
- Is that so? - Yes.

122
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:46,990
- I don't think so. - Why are you blushing?

123
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,460
Also, his rice bowl is empty.

124
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,190
Why do you keep picking up your chopsticks?

125
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,630
(Everything that he does seems suspicious.)

126
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,660
- Why are you picking them up? - Listen.

127
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,460
It's because you're cornering me.

128
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:00,570
(It's because you're cornering me.)

129
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,930
- I was only being normal. - Seok Jin.

130
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,240
- Aren't you full? - I am.

131
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:07,155
- Put down your chopsticks. - No.

132
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:08,370
I want some ribs.

133
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,380
(The suspicious meal is over.)

134
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,225
(They come out to the garden for the official opening.)

135
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:17,280
If you're afraid...

136
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:19,865
(They head to the shoe rack to go outside.)

137
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:23,335
(He looks around.)

138
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:27,030
Didn't Ji Hyo put my shoes on the rack?

139
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,360
(Didn't Ji Hyo put my shoes on the rack?)

140
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:30,960
- Where are your shoes? - Are they missing?

141
00:05:30,967 --> 00:05:32,760
(My shoes are missing.)

142
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,985
Was it a mission to hide my shoes?

143
00:05:36,172 --> 00:05:39,255
Are your shoes missing? Weren't they next to mine?

144
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,185
Ji Hyo put them up earlier.

145
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:45,710
(Jong Kook's shoes were on the shoe rack when they went inside.)

146
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:49,580
(After their meal, his shoes disappeared into thin air.)

147
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:50,620
Ji Hyo put them up earlier.

148
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,250
- Seok Jin. Where did you put them? - Yes?

149
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,520
(It must be you.)

150
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,120
- Mine were on the ground. - I don't know.

151
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,220
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

152
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,020
- How would I know that? - Where did you put my shoes?

153
00:05:58,027 --> 00:05:59,460
- He's the culprit. - Seok Jin.

154
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,690
- How would I know that? - What did you do with my shoes?

155
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:03,475
- It's over. Done, done, done. - Seok Jin.

156
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:04,600
The culprit is...

157
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:05,830
- Jee Seok Jin! - Jee Seok Jin!

158
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,970
- I didn't. Why do you suspect me? - Where did you put my shoes?

159
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:10,900
- Hold on. This is... - Goodness, it's me again.

160
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:14,210
Hold on a second. Attention. Everyone, what's going on?

161
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,340
"Attention"?

162
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:17,255
How can you say that? Some are older than you.

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,795
- That was a bit rude. - You gave me a flower.

164
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,565
- What's going on? - That's a bit rough.

165
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,880
Do you want me to be rough on you?

166
00:06:24,887 --> 00:06:26,080
No, no.

167
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,350
Step aside, Jae Seok.

168
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:29,120
Where did my shoes go?

169
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,460
- Right now, - Who did it?

170
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,020
- Jong Kook's shoes disappeared. - Yes.

171
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,160
Today, someone has a grudge against Jong Kook and stole his shoes.

172
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,530
For today's race, you must catch the petty thief.

173
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:43,145
(Catch the Petty Thief)

174
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,600
His shoes?

175
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:48,340
(Who is the thief that stole Jong Kook's shoes?)

176
00:06:48,344 --> 00:06:49,810
The thief who stole his shoes...

177
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:51,195
is among you.

178
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,480
- It's Seok Jin. It's too obvious. - My gosh.

179
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:55,050
(One member in particular seems very suspicious.)

180
00:06:55,051 --> 00:06:56,450
It's Seok Jin.

181
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:58,820
Let's come back here tomorrow. We'll film it again tomorrow.

182
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,920
It's not me.

183
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:02,020
Gosh, this is crazy. They're suspecting me again.

184
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:03,920
- What is this? - Didn't you fail?

185
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:06,420
All right. The winners of four missions...

186
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:10,660
will be provided with photos of the petty thief's body parts.

187
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:11,730
(Winners will receive photo hints.)

188
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,375
If we get the photo of his nose, it's over.

189
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,600
(Is this a definite clue?)

190
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,570
If the members unanimously apprehend the petty thief...

191
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:21,370
in the final voting, the victory will go to the members.

192
00:07:21,377 --> 00:07:22,510
And you'll be given a present.

193
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:25,325
And the petty thief will receive the water bomb penalty.

194
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:27,250
If you fail to apprehend the petty thief,

195
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,710
everyone except for the petty thief will face the penalty.

196
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,080
And the petty thief will receive the present.

197
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:34,165
First off, we'll give you a pair of shoes.

198
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:35,750
- But you know what? - My gosh.

199
00:07:35,758 --> 00:07:38,260
Do we have to play the race even if we know who it is?

200
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,520
- Who is it? - Goodness.

201
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:42,230
- That's the trick. That's the trap. - This is easy.

202
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,800
Wait, but there might be more than one petty thief.

203
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,230
- Why are we standing like this? - Think about it.

204
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,100
(Are we standing in groups?)

205
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:51,340
- It really wasn't me. - What did you say?

206
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,170
(Petty and suspicious members are in a group together.)

207
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,170
- That's not what I meant. - What's your problem?

208
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,740
- What are you insinuating? - There's an expression for that.

209
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,040
- What's wrong with you? - Let me explain.

210
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:59,240
- What's his problem? - You were together as a group.

211
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,850
- Hey. - So Min's flower was so random.

212
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,350
Everyone didn't say anything about that.

213
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,180
I only gave it to you because you were sitting next to me.

214
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,520
- That's why you gave me the flower? - Yes. It went well with red.

215
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,150
- That's why you gave me the flower? - Yes. You go well with red.

216
00:08:08,157 --> 00:08:10,120
- As soon as we all sat down, - Listen.

217
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:12,820
you were trying to sit next to me. That was really weird.

218
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:14,790
- You usually avoid me. - I tried to avoid sitting there.

219
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,660
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

220
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,660
I wasn't trying to sit there.

221
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,530
- Really? You were avoiding me? - He thought the opposite.

222
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:21,030
- Really? - Now, he misunderstood.

223
00:08:21,037 --> 00:08:23,430
- Hey, you passed now. - Okay, I understand that.

224
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,870
Gosh, those two sycophants are standing right next to him.

225
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,585
Goodness, you annoying punks.

226
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,640
- I can't believe them. - "Mom's..."

227
00:08:29,645 --> 00:08:31,495
- "Mom's..." - "Diary".

228
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,650
What? "Mom's Diary"?

229
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,295
- I bet one of them is the thief. - Seriously.

230
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,020
(There's no way my boys would do that.)

231
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,790
The 1st hint is at stake during this 1st mission.

232
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,420
Let me tell you the rules of Squid Ink Shower.

233
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,790
(Squid Ink Shower)

234
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,930
- What is that? - What's that? We just started.

235
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,690
Form 4 groups of 2.

236
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,360
It will be 2 against 2.

237
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,870
The teams will freely choose to play either offense or defense.

238
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,600
The teams playing defense will put a basket on their heads.

239
00:08:55,605 --> 00:08:59,170
Their goal is to pick the water balloons from the opposing teams...

240
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,570
instead of squid ink balloons.

241
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:02,440
The opposing teams will throw the balloons.

242
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:05,055
If it's water, you'll win the game, but if it's squid ink, you'll lose.

243
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:06,810
- Gosh, this is hard. - Goodness.

244
00:09:06,816 --> 00:09:09,250
This will be a tournament mission.

245
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:10,980
On top of the photo hint for the petty thief,

246
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:13,050
you'll be given a chance to pick...

247
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:15,420
four members to test their identities.

248
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,120
(They'll be given a chance to pick 4 members to test their identities.)

249
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:20,260
- 4 members? Gosh. - 4 members?

250
00:09:20,263 --> 00:09:22,090
- One of them will be the thief. - They'll give us yes or no answers.

251
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:23,460
1 of the 4 will be the thief.

252
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,545
- Seok Jin will be chosen then. - How many are there?

253
00:09:26,302 --> 00:09:29,670
(Tournament bracket: Jae Seok and Ji Hyo versus Kwang Soo and Se Chan)

254
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,440
- Ji Hyo. - Anyway, get Kwang Soo.

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
- I want to take these shoes off. - By the way,

256
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,070
black water might flow down even if Seok Jin got water.

257
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:36,340
The black hair spray?

258
00:09:36,345 --> 00:09:38,440
Doesn't it mean he failed? It has to count as a failure.

259
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,625
If that happens, Seok Jin might not advance.

260
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:42,580
- We'll start. - We're starting.

261
00:09:42,585 --> 00:09:43,795
Okay.

262
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,590
They can just wear raincoats, so only their faces will get wet.

263
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,520
- That's right. That would be funny. - Getting their faces wet is funny.

264
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:52,705
Now that we saw you guys play...

265
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:54,090
(It was edited out since it wasn't funny.)

266
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:56,505
- We realized... That's right. - Our team lost, right?

267
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,200
To be honest,

268
00:09:58,201 --> 00:10:01,530
- getting clothes wet isn't funny. - That's true.

269
00:10:01,537 --> 00:10:02,730
That would be funnier,

270
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,240
but I wonder if Haha would be okay with that.

271
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,200
- I'm okay with that. - Haha is generous, so it's okay.

272
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,910
Besides, he has to be okay with that on his own.

273
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,570
And it's not that important right now.

274
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,040
Leave him alone. He can sort it out alone.

275
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:13,950
The important thing is that we must catch the shoe thief.

276
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,410
- I forgot about that. - Right.

277
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:16,950
(I forget about that.)

278
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,280
(What?)

279
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,480
Come on, Seok Jin.

280
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,520
- Stop acting innocent. - That was our mission.

281
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,075
It would've been better if he didn't say that.

282
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:28,190
- That's not the thief's focus. - Right, right.

283
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,405
- Right. I forgot about that. - Right.

284
00:10:33,836 --> 00:10:36,000
- Let's get them. Got that? - Okay.

285
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:38,040
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo must stay away from the squid ink balloon.)

286
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,325
I'm sure of it. I bet Kwang Soo has the squid ink balloon.

287
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:42,840
They know which one they're holding.

288
00:10:42,845 --> 00:10:44,355
It has to be him.

289
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:46,340
(It's time to choose the balloon.)

290
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:47,510
What do you think about Se Chan's?

291
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:49,250
Should we go with Se Chan's? Let's go with his.

292
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:50,880
(Let's go with Se Chan's balloon.)

293
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:51,850
Yang Se Chan's.

294
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,990
(Yang Se Chan's)

295
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,050
(Surprised)

296
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,535
- Did we start? - Yes.

297
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,060
- We choose Se Chan's. - But we...

298
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,890
- We have to mix... - Se Chan's.

299
00:10:59,896 --> 00:11:01,790
- Don't switch them. - We weren't ready yet.

300
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,460
Hey, we already chose the balloon.

301
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:04,600
- No, we weren't ready. - Hey.

302
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,900
- We picked Se Chan's. - No, because...

303
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,670
- Hey, we chose Se Chan's. - We didn't switch...

304
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,530
- Wait, wait. - We already made our decision.

305
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,400
- No, we weren't ready yet. - We already said his name.

306
00:11:11,407 --> 00:11:12,940
- We weren't ready then. - We weren't ready.

307
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:16,070
- Wait. We have to mix them up. - We already said Se Chan's name.

308
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,555
Goodness, those petty thieves.

309
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:20,540
They're so small-minded.

310
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,925
Gosh, they're so petty.

311
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:24,480
Aren't they? They should steal some shoes at least, right?

312
00:11:24,487 --> 00:11:28,365
(Aren't they? They should steal some shoes at least, right?)

313
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:30,520
- What? - Right?

314
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,020
(What? Are you talking to me?)

315
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:34,545
They should be gutsy enough to steal shoes.

316
00:11:34,597 --> 00:11:35,730
No.

317
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:37,260
Hey, forget about that.

318
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,100
If you want to win, forget about them.

319
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:41,430
I must think about my shoes to catch the petty thief.

320
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:42,915
No, you ought to let that go.

321
00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:45,100
- We're going to go with that. - Bring us new balloons.

322
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:46,670
- What are you doing? - We'll go with that.

323
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,725
- We'll do it with new ones. - What are you doing?

324
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,695
- This is unbelievable. - No, listen.

325
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:54,150
Is this just water?

326
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,450
(Changing balloons on the sly)

327
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:56,810
Shouldn't you check the balloons?

328
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,720
- What if they're both squid ink? - If they're both squid ink,

329
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,180
they have to get the water bomb penalty.

330
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:02,320
To have a fair match, this is what we're going to do.

331
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,320
Both balloons might be squid ink. After you pick a balloon,

332
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:06,905
- should they get the other one? - Should we do that?

333
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,630
Why do we have to do that?

334
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:10,230
I swear. Both balloons aren't squid ink.

335
00:12:10,232 --> 00:12:12,500
- Why would we get the other one? - I swear. Both aren't squid ink.

336
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:15,530
- Listen up. - Don't come. Stop getting close.

337
00:12:15,538 --> 00:12:17,700
Why didn't you let us go with the one we chose earlier?

338
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:20,300
- The balloons weren't mixed up. - We weren't ready.

339
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,070
- You should've said, "start". - You should've said it loud.

340
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:24,940
"Start."

341
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,280
No, listen.

342
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:28,510
- "Start." See? It was loud. - That's not fair.

343
00:12:28,517 --> 00:12:30,480
- We don't know either. - We don't know.

344
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:31,695
Is that so?

345
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:33,765
Se Chan's.

346
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:36,205
(Lowering right away)

347
00:12:36,225 --> 00:12:38,035
- Kwang Soo's. - Kwang Soo's.

348
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,105
(Oh, no.)

349
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,030
You had to choose on the count of three.

350
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,460
- Choose on the count of three. - Kwang Soo's.

351
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:45,830
Jae Seok was merely saying his name.

352
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,630
- That's right. Start. - I had the final say in it.

353
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,045
- Kwang Soo's. - Great, Kwang Soo's.

354
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:50,715
Are you ready now?

355
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,640
They're doing it.

356
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,310
(They hold Kwang Soo's balloon without any trickery.)

357
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,170
I don't know about this. I really don't.

358
00:12:56,178 --> 00:12:58,940
- It's water. It has to be water. - Kwang Soo, we're not ready.

359
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:01,910
- I'll give you one more chance. - Kwang Soo's.

360
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,295
- Kwang Soo's. - Kwang Soo's.

361
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,150
- Can you give us one more chance? - Kwang Soo's.

362
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,590
- Kwang Soo's. - I'm really going to throw it.

363
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,905
- Yes. - Okay.

364
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,450
- It's water. It's water. - Nice.

365
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,460
(Fine, get the balloons.)

366
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,245
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo successfully figure out the water balloon.)

367
00:13:16,332 --> 00:13:18,475
Why did you make that face?

368
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:19,960
What do you mean?

369
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:22,645
They figured it out because you lowered the basket right away.

370
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:24,640
Gosh, this guy is a mess.

371
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,255
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo acquire 1 point.)

372
00:13:27,376 --> 00:13:29,985
Look at the difference in height for the basket. Look.

373
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:31,880
Se Chan, isn't it too high for you?

374
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:33,140
(The pair seems off-balance.)

375
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,480
- No towels around your necks? - Se Chan will get the most of it.

376
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:36,750
- Let's switch places. - Should we wrap our necks?

377
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,180
- What? - Should we wrap our necks?

378
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:39,450
We're going to start right away.

379
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,265
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo go to get their balloons.)

380
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,590
You little runt.

381
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,520
(Jong Kook is wrapping the towel around his neck.)

382
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:46,735
Gosh, Jong Kook. This must be what it means to have two sides.

383
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,760
He was nicely wrapping the towel around Se Chan's neck...

384
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:50,205
as he curses at him at the same time.

385
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:52,260
Gosh, I can't figure him out.

386
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,960
- I can't say anything. He's nice. - Right.

387
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:56,400
- His actions are nice, - But he says harsh words.

388
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:57,740
but he said a mean curse word.

389
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,885
- He's sweet and scary. - That's right.

390
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:01,770
All right.

391
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,110
- Ji Hyo's? - It's Jae Seok's.

392
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,355
- Jae Seok's? - Yes.

393
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,510
Jae Seok's.

394
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:07,450
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan choose Jae Seok's balloon.)

395
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,650
Okay.

396
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:09,710
Don't switch.

397
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:10,880
- Gosh. - My gosh.

398
00:14:10,886 --> 00:14:11,980
Don't switch.

399
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:13,180
(Popping)

400
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,765
- Come on! - It popped.

401
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,120
It popped.

402
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,250
- Come on! - It popped.

403
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:19,935
(What are you doing?)

404
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,390
- Hey, it just popped. - What will you do now?

405
00:14:21,397 --> 00:14:23,360
- Come on, what was that? - It just popped.

406
00:14:23,365 --> 00:14:25,060
- I didn't pop it. - How will he pay for this?

407
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,860
- It popped. - We'll side with them.

408
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,030
- There's nothing we can do. - That can't happen.

409
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,145
- When will this game end then? - It popped.

410
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:31,800
- Gosh, this... - You'll let this slide?

411
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:33,070
- Be careful. - I'll hold it.

412
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:35,470
- "Be careful"? - Are you serious?

413
00:14:35,478 --> 00:14:36,810
- I guess there was a thorn. - What nonsense.

414
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:38,940
- Your hands aren't thorny. - There are no thorns here.

415
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,040
I didn't do it.

416
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:41,950
- Jae Seok, be careful. - We're serious.

417
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,780
- I'm serious. - Promise that you'll be careful.

418
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:45,765
- Yes, I promise to be careful. - Okay.

419
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,905
What are we going to do? What is this?

420
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,835
- I'm sorry. - Just forgive him.

421
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,620
- I'm sorry. - Forgive him this once.

422
00:14:52,628 --> 00:14:54,405
He was the most surprised.

423
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,145
I was just turning around. I can't believe this happened.

424
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,130
(Gosh, he's playing innocent.)

425
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:00,415
I can pop yours too.

426
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:04,455
- I'll explode if you do it again. - Be careful.

427
00:15:05,307 --> 00:15:06,400
They wouldn't switch, right?

428
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:07,810
- They'll feel conscious of it. - Look.

429
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,455
(Wouldn't it be Jae Seok's?)

430
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,295
- Jae Seok's. - Jae Seok's.

431
00:15:13,516 --> 00:15:15,450
I won't let you slide this time. I clearly warned you.

432
00:15:15,451 --> 00:15:17,280
(It's hard to read Jae Seok and Ji Hyo's faces.)

433
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:18,695
I'll kick you.

434
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:19,880
What is it?

435
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,790
- You have no choice. Throw it. - I must throw it.

436
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,890
You can't do it again.

437
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:26,190
(If it's the squid ink, Jae Seok and Ji Hyo wins.)

438
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,860
(Did Kwang Soo and Se Chan choose the right balloon?)

439
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:34,275
(The unlucky ones deserve the squid ink.)

440
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:38,240
- Didn't you guys put on the hood? - Come on.

441
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,140
Why didn't you put on the hood?

442
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,785
(Why didn't you put on the hood?)

443
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:45,380
They took off the hoods when they were complaining...

444
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:46,480
and never put them back on.

445
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:48,650
- Were we supposed to put them on? - Yes.

446
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:50,920
- We have hoods? - Why would we wear raincoats?

447
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,665
- We do? - Yes.

448
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:54,965
Why would we wear raincoats otherwise?

449
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,560
Kwang Soo's face...

450
00:15:59,562 --> 00:16:02,360
- His eyebrows are connected. - You look South American.

451
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:03,490
South American?

452
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,400
You look handsome.

453
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:06,860
- You do. - Right.

454
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,230
- You should do this all the time. - Why do you look happy?

455
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:10,600
- You should do this all the time. - You look great.

456
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:11,600
I like it.

457
00:16:11,607 --> 00:16:13,615
(Will he be the prince of South America?)

458
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:17,140
- Jae Seok and Ji Hyo... - Okay.

459
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:20,240
- won a hint about the culprit. - Share it with us.

460
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,910
- You can share it with others. - Show us too.

461
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:24,080
- Show us. - Show us.

462
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:25,750
We shouldn't share it with you.

463
00:16:25,754 --> 00:16:27,595
- Let us see it first. - Take a look.

464
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:31,620
What's this?

465
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:34,690
(The culprit's ankles)

466
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:37,390
(It looks like a man.)

467
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,430
(Is the thief among the male members?)

468
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:42,370
You can share it with others if you want.

469
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:45,240
Please choose four candidates.

470
00:16:45,241 --> 00:16:47,670
When you choose candidates,

471
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,540
choose those who never went outside...

472
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,040
and Seok Jin.

473
00:16:51,046 --> 00:16:52,340
- You think so? - Then you'll know.

474
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,810
- Don't choose Haha. - Who stayed inside?

475
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:55,210
- I stayed inside. - I went outside.

476
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,480
(Haha and So Min stayed inside.)

477
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:58,580
- I stayed inside. - I stayed inside.

478
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,750
- I went outside. - He went outside.

479
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,290
I went to get water.

480
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,650
But Ji Hyo stayed in our sight.

481
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,720
We saw her get water.

482
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,690
- Ji Hyo, me, and So Min. - I was in your sight too.

483
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,960
- I was in your sight too. - That's true.

484
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:11,360
But we can't trust him.

485
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:12,600
Why not?

486
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:14,270
- We just can't. - I...

487
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,100
These four would be good.

488
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:17,800
Seok Jin has to be included.

489
00:17:17,806 --> 00:17:19,600
- We have to choose him. - We have to.

490
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:22,770
- Seok Jin, So Min, - Haha.

491
00:17:22,778 --> 00:17:24,640
- Haha, and Ji Hyo. - But...

492
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:26,510
(Seok Jin, So Min, Haha, and Ji Hyo)

493
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:29,510
(Is the thief among these 4?)

494
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,780
Who are the four candidates?

495
00:17:31,787 --> 00:17:33,280
- Go up. - Me?

496
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,690
- Of course. - Of course.

497
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,750
- "Me?" - You're...

498
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,520
You're the prime candidate.

499
00:17:37,526 --> 00:17:39,360
- Of course, you should go up. - Gosh, this is frustrating.

500
00:17:39,361 --> 00:17:41,945
The thief...

501
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,175
is...

502
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:50,815
(Seok Jin is the most suspicious, and the other three aren't.)

503
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,570
(The thief is...)

504
00:17:55,577 --> 00:17:57,240
- Among these four. - Congratulations.

505
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:59,055
(The thief is among these four.)

506
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:01,250
- Now we can be... - It's 100 percent.

507
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,480
- I'm 100 percent sure. - Goodbye

508
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:04,580
(Congratulations. Seok Jin is definitely the thief.)

509
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,750
It's 100 percent.

510
00:18:05,754 --> 00:18:07,890
- Try to suspect the other three. - It's 100 percent.

511
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,650
Exclude me.

512
00:18:09,658 --> 00:18:11,060
- All right. - This is the last advice...

513
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,360
- I can give to you. - I get it.

514
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,775
(Is Seok Jin really the thief?)

515
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,675
Shouldn't we suspect all four candidates?

516
00:18:16,932 --> 00:18:19,500
Not just Seok Jin...

517
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,430
(Everyone is thinking about the result.)

518
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:23,300
- What are you thinking about? - What?

519
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,200
(What are you thinking about?)

520
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,770
What's on your mind?

521
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:29,440
I was thinking I should work hard.

522
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,970
He's restless.

523
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:34,010
- Just return Jong Kook's shoes. - He's immersed in thoughts.

524
00:18:34,016 --> 00:18:35,910
If I was Seok Jin,

525
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:38,580
I'd tell Jong Kook the truth ask for his forgiveness.

526
00:18:38,587 --> 00:18:41,050
- Me too. - Hey! I'm not the thief!

527
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:43,120
This has happened before, right?

528
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,820
I deny it, but they don't believe me.

529
00:18:44,827 --> 00:18:47,020
You even came to get the ribs.

530
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:48,990
- You were giving them to me. - You'd normally...

531
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,960
stay where you are.

532
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,660
You wouldn't come to us.

533
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:54,160
He doesn't usually move.

534
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:55,730
He never does.

535
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:58,015
- This is so stressful. - Seok Jin is definitely the thief.

536
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,300
This is so unfair.

537
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:01,670
This is happening again.

538
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:03,840
I'll give you another mission.

539
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:06,810
It's Three Car Games.

540
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:07,910
(3 Car Games)

541
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:09,480
Are we playing games in the car?

542
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,620
If everyone passes...

543
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,080
all three missions,

544
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,820
you'll be given three hints.

545
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:17,420
- Three? - That's awesome.

546
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:18,660
If everyone passes the missions?

547
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,090
- I'll prove my innocence. - Okay.

548
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:24,675
The first mission is the mouth gag game.

549
00:19:24,967 --> 00:19:26,100
- Mouth gag? - Mouth gag?

550
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,530
- Are we putting on mouth gags? - Mouth gag?

551
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:31,200
Everyone has to blow bubbles while wearing a mouth gag...

552
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:33,400
within 30 seconds.

553
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,410
That sounds hard.

554
00:19:35,411 --> 00:19:39,155
Gosh, we're playing such a strange game in the car.

555
00:19:39,681 --> 00:19:41,310
We have to wear a bib too?

556
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,580
7 or 8?

557
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,880
One for each.

558
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:46,295
One for each?

559
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,565
One for each?

560
00:19:48,957 --> 00:19:50,305
Oh, my goodness.

561
00:19:50,926 --> 00:19:53,090
Everything I say sounds weird, right?

562
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,990
- You sound really weird. - Stop suspecting me.

563
00:19:54,997 --> 00:19:56,660
Stop suspecting me.

564
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,000
"What is a mouth gag?"

565
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,630
Give Seok Jin a break.

566
00:20:00,636 --> 00:20:02,070
- Stop it. - Jong Kook.

567
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,530
We understand you, but you should give him a break.

568
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:05,200
He keeps saying weird things.

569
00:20:05,207 --> 00:20:06,740
I'm okay.

570
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,770
"What is a mouth gag?"

571
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:10,010
What do you mean?

572
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:12,195
Just stay quiet.

573
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,410
(Laughing)

574
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,295
How do you put this on?

575
00:20:16,685 --> 00:20:18,695
(Like this)

576
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:22,490
You're good at everything.

577
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:25,135
You're even good at putting on a mouth gag.

578
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,430
- It's too big! - It's too big!

579
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:30,590
(It's hard to even put on.)

580
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,400
- It's too big! - Let's hurry up.

581
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,360
I'm drooling.

582
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,630
(They'll go from So Min to Se Chan.)

583
00:20:35,637 --> 00:20:37,400
Let's start from So Min. Ready.

584
00:20:37,406 --> 00:20:38,615
(Start)

585
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,085
(So Min succeeds.)

586
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:44,385
Okay.

587
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,810
It's hard.

588
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,095
(Jong Kook succeeds.)

589
00:20:48,217 --> 00:20:50,225
(Fail)

590
00:20:51,086 --> 00:20:54,950
(Fail)

591
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:57,335
It's not working.

592
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:59,375
You're stalling.

593
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:02,230
- You're stalling. - There you go.

594
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:04,205
- That was intentional, wasn't it? - No.

595
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,460
(Struggling)

596
00:21:06,468 --> 00:21:07,975
- I succeeded, right? - Yes.

597
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:11,515
(Haha succeeds with 10 seconds left.)

598
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,570
(Blowing)

599
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:15,925
- There you go. - There you go.

600
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:19,410
(It's Se Chan's turn with 3 seconds left.)

601
00:21:19,414 --> 00:21:22,910
(If he succeeds, they'll win a hint.)

602
00:21:22,918 --> 00:21:26,720
(Will he succeed?)

603
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:27,995
Se Chan.

604
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,765
There you go.

605
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,020
(Se Chan.)

606
00:21:31,026 --> 00:21:32,920
(As soon as Jong Kook calls him, he succeeds.)

607
00:21:32,928 --> 00:21:34,390
- Success! - Success!

608
00:21:34,396 --> 00:21:35,490
Is it a success?

609
00:21:35,497 --> 00:21:36,990
It's so funny.

610
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:38,700
Se Chan was struggling,

611
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,375
but as soon as he heard, "Se Chan",

612
00:21:40,636 --> 00:21:44,000
he succeeded right away.

613
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:45,640
How did you do that?

614
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,370
Here goes the first hint.

615
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,740
- Hold on. - This is the culprit?

616
00:21:49,745 --> 00:21:50,740
It's a silhouette?

617
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,610
It's an arm under an umbrella.

618
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:53,640
It's an arm.

619
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,480
(The thief's elbow under a rainbow umbrella)

620
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,780
It looks like Se Chan's arm.

621
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:01,265
It looks like Se Chan.

622
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,790
It looks like Se Chan.

623
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,665
Se Chan has a lot of moles on his arm.

624
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,860
- There are no moles in the picture. - No.

625
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:09,930
Just above the elbow,

626
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:11,860
there is a black spot.

627
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,645
- Let me see. - Isn't it just dirt?

628
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,945
- I have a mole. - I have a mole too.

629
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:17,330
Let me see.

630
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,500
(Jong Kook is checking everyone's elbow.)

631
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,785
- Let me see. - Everyone has a mole?

632
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:25,840
(How does Seok Jin's elbow look?)

633
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,625
- It's him. - It's him.

634
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,710
(It's him.)

635
00:22:29,718 --> 00:22:31,720
(It's me?)

636
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,550
- What did you see? - What?

637
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:35,250
- What's there? - You have a spot.

638
00:22:35,257 --> 00:22:37,720
What are you talking about?

639
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:39,920
- Let's just stop. - Goodness.

640
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:42,030
It's Seok Jin.

641
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,205
(Every piece of evidence points to Seok Jin.)

642
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:47,930
- I look back... - "I look back?"

643
00:22:47,936 --> 00:22:49,370
What does that mean?

644
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:52,100
- Don't look back - Don't look back

645
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:53,540
- Gosh, it's driving me crazy. - Don't

646
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,010
- Regret - Regret

647
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,840
They're framing me.

648
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:02,510
(Do better next time.)

649
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:04,210
Let's start the second mission.

650
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:05,980
It's Random Five Second Talk.

651
00:23:05,988 --> 00:23:07,380
(Random 5 Second Talk)

652
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:09,920
You'll be given a random question about another member.

653
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:12,260
You have to give 3 answers within 5 seconds.

654
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,920
- Okay. - Okay.

655
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:16,090
- It sounds hard. - Can you give us an example?

656
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,875
Let's say the question is "What are Jae Seok's strengths?"...

657
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:20,730
and I answer, "He is nice. He is a good host."

658
00:23:20,736 --> 00:23:22,830
"He is handsome." Does "He is handsome" not count?

659
00:23:22,838 --> 00:23:25,000
- It could count. - It's too farfetched.

660
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,240
It could count.

661
00:23:26,241 --> 00:23:27,870
- It's too farfetched. - Did you say it's too farfetched?

662
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,440
It could count.

663
00:23:29,444 --> 00:23:31,240
- It could count. - Then we'd just fail.

664
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:32,780
Why would we fail with that?

665
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:34,610
- It's like saying I'm tall. - Exactly.

666
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,110
It should count.

667
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:38,220
Being handsome is subjective.

668
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,750
You have to give 3 answers within 5 seconds.

669
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:43,005
Kwang Soo will answer a question about So Min.

670
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:46,360
Ready, start.

671
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,690
When is So Min prettiest?

672
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,290
Right now, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.

673
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:50,990
(Right now, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.)

674
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,000
(What?)

675
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,030
(Just say, "Every day.")

676
00:23:54,036 --> 00:23:55,770
- So Min is touched. - That was nice.

677
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,545
When is So Min happiest?

678
00:23:58,006 --> 00:23:59,715
Right now, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.

679
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:00,970
What?

680
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,570
(Right now, yesterday, and the day before yesterday.)

681
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:04,640
- What? - Good job.

682
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:06,940
- It makes sense. - That was clever.

683
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,765
What do you want to give So Min as a gift?

684
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:12,295
Money, cigarettes...

685
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,190
- What? - Hold on.

686
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,790
He can give her...

687
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,020
whatever he wants.

688
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,675
She doesn't smoke, but...

689
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:21,390
- All right. - Stop it.

690
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:23,660
You failed.

691
00:24:23,665 --> 00:24:25,060
(Running Man abides by the regulations.)

692
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:27,015
- Gosh. - What's wrong?

693
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,945
Gosh. You're too much.

694
00:24:29,037 --> 00:24:30,000
(I'll get you back, Kwang Soo.)

695
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,230
It's Haha's turn now.

696
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,740
You'll answer questions about Jong Kook.

697
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:34,400
- Jong Kook? - Yes.

698
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:36,040
Why?

699
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:38,480
Can't I answer questions about someone easier?

700
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,710
No one is easier than me, you brat.

701
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:42,310
You're right.

702
00:24:42,317 --> 00:24:44,380
- You brat, good luck. - Start.

703
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:46,235
What makes Jong Kook smile biggest?

704
00:24:46,722 --> 00:24:48,950
Exercise, a shower after exercise, and food after exercise.

705
00:24:48,957 --> 00:24:50,250
(Exercise, a shower after exercise, and food after exercise.)

706
00:24:50,258 --> 00:24:52,060
Why does Jong Kook visit LA so often?

707
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,590
His girlfriend, his ex-girlfriend,

708
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,645
and his daughter.

709
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:58,260
His daughter?

710
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:01,330
(His daughter)

711
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:03,400
(He has a daughter in LA?)

712
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:05,440
It's an exclusive! Jong Kook has a daughter!

713
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,770
My daughter?

714
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,310
You have a daughter in the US?

715
00:25:09,311 --> 00:25:11,780
She got into USC.

716
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
- Really? - Yes.

717
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:14,440
She's a good student.

718
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:15,850
What is Jong Kook most scared of?

719
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:19,835
His daughter, his girlfriend, and his ex-girlfriend.

720
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:23,865
(All the answers include his girlfriends and daughter.)

721
00:25:23,925 --> 00:25:25,320
- Success! - Success!

722
00:25:25,327 --> 00:25:26,290
It was perfect.

723
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:27,990
- It was amazing. - I'm sorry.

724
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,630
- I was just kidding. - It was perfect.

725
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,660
Just kidding.

726
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:33,100
- I was just doing my best. - Good job.

727
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,770
I didn't know I was a fool for my daughter.

728
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,170
He's a fool for his daughter.

729
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:39,240
Gosh, I kind of wish I had a daughter now.

730
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:42,070
(I kind of wish I had a daughter now.)

731
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:44,140
- Jong Kook. - What do you mean?

732
00:25:44,146 --> 00:25:47,010
People will be searching for "Jong Kook's daughter".

733
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,610
- "A fool for his daughter". - "A fool for his daughter".

734
00:25:49,618 --> 00:25:50,710
I want a daughter.

735
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,895
Maybe he really has one.

736
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,950
- Do you have one? - What are you talking about?

737
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:58,435
- What if you have one... - Give him his shoes back.

738
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,790
- Give them back. - I don't have his shoes.

739
00:26:01,797 --> 00:26:04,705
- Give them back. - Next question.

740
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,260
- Jae Seok, this is about Seok Jin. - Seok Jin?

741
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,030
It's the problematic guy.

742
00:26:09,037 --> 00:26:11,230
- You're the problematic guy. - Get ready, set, go.

743
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:13,885
When was Seok Jin most helpful as the oldest member?

744
00:26:14,276 --> 00:26:15,270
(Considering)

745
00:26:15,277 --> 00:26:17,140
- Hold on. - Hey, answer him.

746
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:20,355
(Fail)

747
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:24,610
Answer him. Yesterday, today, and the day before yesterday.

748
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,680
Answer him.

749
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:28,050
My bad. I didn't know you'd start like that.

750
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:29,450
(I got it wrong from the beginning.)

751
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:32,120
- What does that mean? - He'll go to the next question.

752
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:33,690
- Next question. - Let's move on.

753
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:36,530
Let's go again. Get ready, set, go.

754
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:38,675
What are Seok Jin's charms as a man?

755
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,975
Tell him.

756
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:45,600
Confidence, courage, and sense of justice.

757
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:47,370
This is too hard.

758
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,970
This is harder than an exam.

759
00:26:48,977 --> 00:26:51,540
- Why is this game so hard? - That was too hard.

760
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:52,940
He said he has a sense of justice.

761
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:55,810
- I have three. - These questions are hard.

762
00:26:55,817 --> 00:26:58,480
So far, only Haha has succeeded.

763
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,280
- Really? - That was too hard.

764
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:02,550
- I couldn't even say a word. - Ji Hyo, yours is about Haha.

765
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,035
Haha?

766
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:06,020
Get ready, set, go.

767
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:07,990
What are some other jobs that suit Haha?

768
00:27:07,996 --> 00:27:10,690
(What are some other jobs that suit Haha?)

769
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:14,430
She needs... Hold on.

770
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,030
- She needs a pause. - Hold on.

771
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,440
Hold on. Why is mine so hard?

772
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,000
- How's that hard? - That came out of nowhere.

773
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:21,000
(There are so many occupations out there.)

774
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:23,740
Fashion designer, lawyer, and doctor.

775
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:26,055
I thought this was a practice game. It was that easy.

776
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:27,610
(She's the worst in quizzes.)

777
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,650
- Seok Jin. - Yes.

778
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:32,695
Get ready, set, go. What are Jae Seok's habits?

779
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,495
He picks his nose...

780
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,920
He's acting weird. He's so weird.

781
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:42,530
- He doesn't have habits. - This is weird.

782
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,160
Let's give him a turn at the end.

783
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:47,530
- That looked so intentional. - No way. He has no habits.

784
00:27:47,535 --> 00:27:50,070
This is the last game.

785
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:52,140
It's English 3, 6, 9.

786
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,510
(The last mission is English 3, 6, 9.)

787
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,040
I can't speak English. I'm bad.

788
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:01,010
- 1, 2. - 1, 2, 3.

789
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:03,150
- 4, 5. - 4, 5.

790
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,980
- 6. - You clap twice on 6.

791
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:06,880
- We can't even do this in Korean. - We can't.

792
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:09,150
- This is so hard. - How do you pronounce eight?

793
00:28:09,157 --> 00:28:11,450
- It's "eight". - "Eight".

794
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:14,120
You also say, "fifteen" and "fifty".

795
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:16,960
There are some people who can't go beyond that.

796
00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:19,415
I'll be done at 10.

797
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,430
- Really? - We can't even reach 20.

798
00:28:21,436 --> 00:28:23,900
- Let's start with you, Seok Jin. - Okay, let's go this way.

799
00:28:23,905 --> 00:28:26,240
- Is Jae Seok last? - Yes. Let's go.

800
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,400
3, 6, 9. Start.

801
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:29,740
- 3, 6, 9. - 3, 6, 9.

802
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:31,055
- 1. - 2.

803
00:28:31,246 --> 00:28:32,440
- 4. - 5.

804
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:33,440
- 5. - 5.

805
00:28:33,448 --> 00:28:34,640
(Six)

806
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:35,650
- 7. - 7.

807
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,750
- 8. - 8.

808
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,020
(Nine)

809
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,280
10. What was that?

810
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:43,565
(10. What was that?)

811
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,620
- That was so weird. - Is this all just a show?

812
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:48,990
- What was that? - What if there are two people?

813
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:50,905
(Maybe it's Seok Jin and Jong Kook.)

814
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,800
Why would you get English wrong?

815
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,530
No, this is difficult in Korean too. It's more difficult in English.

816
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:58,615
It might be two people. We have to consider that possibility.

817
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,770
That was weird, Jong Kook.

818
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:02,170
(He made an unreasonable mistake. Is something going on?)

819
00:29:02,177 --> 00:29:03,955
We failed. Can you give us another chance?

820
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:06,340
- Do you want one last chance? - Yes.

821
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:08,550
- We'll switch the order. - Let's go the opposite way.

822
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,010
- Okay. - This is easy.

823
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,610
- Start. - Start.

824
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,050
- 3, 6, 9. - 3, 6, 9.

825
00:29:14,055 --> 00:29:15,465
- 1. - 2.

826
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,665
- 4. - 5.

827
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:19,235
- 5. - 5.

828
00:29:19,694 --> 00:29:21,120
- 7. - 7.

829
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:22,445
- 8. - 8.

830
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:24,760
- It's 8. - It's 8.

831
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,500
(Clapping)

832
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:29,185
- Stop it. - It's eight.

833
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:31,530
- This is all just a show. - What was that?

834
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,670
I pronounce English the proper way,

835
00:29:33,675 --> 00:29:35,070
so I got confused.

836
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:37,040
- That was so obvious. - Jong Kook.

837
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,910
He might have plotted something with Seok Jin.

838
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,640
But there's no motive.

839
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:44,525
- Why not? Tricking the others. - What's the motive?

840
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:46,195
Me?

841
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,290
- Is that possible? - When you plot something,

842
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,320
there's always an assistant.

843
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:53,890
- Because people can get suspicious. - To confuse people.

844
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,990
That doesn't make me feel good. I'm not an assistant.

845
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:58,160
- I mean you have roles. - Don't you know me?

846
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:00,030
- Your role today. - Seok Jin,

847
00:30:00,035 --> 00:30:02,930
it's not because you want to do it.

848
00:30:02,937 --> 00:30:05,900
- I'm not an assistant. - You're the worker.

849
00:30:05,907 --> 00:30:08,970
Let's ask Jong Kook to go on the platform.

850
00:30:08,977 --> 00:30:10,640
- Me? - We have to try it.

851
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:12,740
- Me? Why me? - That was so weird.

852
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:14,240
- You're weird too. - We're suspecting you.

853
00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:17,165
I wasn't sure before, but I'm pretty certain now.

854
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,480
Go ahead. I don't care.

855
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:20,865
(Go ahead. I don't care.)

856
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:25,160
- Don't say that. - I have nothing to say.

857
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,320
Don't say that. We're going to try it. Please.

858
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:30,575
- Go ahead. - "Go ahead."

859
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,160
"I don't care."

860
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,130
(He copies Jong Kook.)

861
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,170
- You sound similar to him. - Oh, gosh.

862
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,700
Did I say it like that?

863
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:39,140
Let's do an impression of him. "Go ahead."

864
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,170
- "Go ahead." - "I don't care."

865
00:30:41,176 --> 00:30:42,385
(What are the identities of these two suspects?)

866
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:45,140
- This is so pretty. - Where are we?

867
00:30:45,146 --> 00:30:46,710
It's a garden. It's pretty.

868
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:48,910
- We haven't been here before. - This is pretty.

869
00:30:48,917 --> 00:30:51,010
- Is this it? - It's pretty.

870
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,395
What is this?

871
00:30:52,787 --> 00:30:55,095
What's wrong with these shoes? My feet are getting wet.

872
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:57,450
- Those are water shoes. - Are they?

873
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:00,335
(It's for going in the water.)

874
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:03,530
My feet are getting soaked. Goodness.

875
00:31:03,531 --> 00:31:04,790
- Seok Jin, - These shoes.

876
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,430
why did you wear socks with water shoes?

877
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:10,000
- How can you be funny with shoes? - My feet are getting soaked.

878
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:12,440
Stop stealing shoes and stop being funny with shoes.

879
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,770
- Oh, gosh. - There's a reason.

880
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:18,640
He's ready to take the water bomb penalty.

881
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:21,240
- He's really funny these days. - I agree.

882
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,450
- Oh, gosh. - He's humorous using everything.

883
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:25,780
He makes people laugh with the most random things.

884
00:31:25,787 --> 00:31:28,250
- He planned it ahead of time. - He's incredible.

885
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,050
Wear the shoes you stole from me.

886
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:31,320
(If your feet are soaked, wear the shoes you stole from me.)

887
00:31:31,326 --> 00:31:32,735
Wear those.

888
00:31:33,128 --> 00:31:35,630
- I have many pairs at home. - You were so obvious.

889
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,460
- Gosh. - Say it if you're jealous.

890
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:41,230
Once his feet get soaked, he'll disappear.

891
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:43,615
He'll go where he hid Jong Kook's shoes.

892
00:31:43,905 --> 00:31:48,070
This mission is called Shoe Bag Toss.

893
00:31:48,076 --> 00:31:49,385
(Shoe Bag Toss)

894
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,140
The person who throws the bag farthest will get a hint.

895
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,425
- Okay. - I see.

896
00:31:54,516 --> 00:31:56,950
The winner gets two hints.

897
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:58,920
- That's great. - Okay.

898
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,650
You have all eight items in your bags right now,

899
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:05,035
so they're very heavy.

900
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:07,935
You'll be able to throw them far once they become lighter.

901
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,660
Here's your chance to make your bags lighter.

902
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,260
You'll put these pants on and dance to the music.

903
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:16,870
Once I blow the whistle, you have to stick the words...

904
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:19,340
that are spelled correctly on your butt. We'll let you...

905
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,570
take out the items that are spelled right.

906
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:23,825
- Okay. - Let's get the hints.

907
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:27,525
- All right. Music. - There's a dumbbell.

908
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:30,695
- It can't be too light. - Cue the music.

909
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:36,065
(Up and down)

910
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:39,820
(So Min looks at the words while doing her fancy footwork.)

911
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,020
So Min, show them.

912
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:43,205
(Shake it.)

913
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:47,845
(Running Man is in love with So Min's dance.)

914
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,285
This is my favorite move.

915
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:50,915
That's not how you do it.

916
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:54,970
(They must find the words that are spelled correctly.)

917
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,685
So Min, spread them out.

918
00:32:59,447 --> 00:33:00,925
It changed.

919
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:03,550
I want to dance like Bo Ra.

920
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,980
- She's so good. - This.

921
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:08,250
(Bo Ra's dance heated up Running Man.)

922
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,005
(Bo Ra's dance?)

923
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,765
Isn't this it?

924
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:13,720
(She does a wave.)

925
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,005
That wasn't it.

926
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,745
It's this.

927
00:33:17,465 --> 00:33:21,045
(Bo Ra didn't do that, but he's close.)

928
00:33:21,536 --> 00:33:23,900
(Bo Ra's dance is easy.)

929
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:25,515
Twerking.

930
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:28,000
- That's so dirty. - What are you doing?

931
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:30,385
(Stop twerking.)

932
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:32,740
(He gets punished with a kick.)

933
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,910
Twerking.

934
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,125
(He gets punished with a kick.)

935
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:39,395
(While everybody is dancing, Seok Jin...)

936
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:43,965
(searches for the words and finds "beans".)

937
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:46,990
(He finds it and dances on it.)

938
00:33:46,995 --> 00:33:48,420
(I'll hide it and stick it on myself.)

939
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,030
(Whistle)

940
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:51,905
(Pushing)

941
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,245
(Seok Jin gets flung away.)

942
00:33:55,136 --> 00:33:56,600
(They are after "beans" too.)

943
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:59,970
- 10, 9, 8, - That was mine.

944
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:02,115
- 7, 6... - That was mine.

945
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,840
- I can't give up rice. - Five,

946
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:08,140
- 4, 3, - Where is it?

947
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:09,980
- 2, 1. - I can't give up rice.

948
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:10,980
(It's over.)

949
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:13,250
It's good.

950
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,750
- It's all good. - I got nothing.

951
00:34:15,757 --> 00:34:18,665
- I got nothing. - I got rice.

952
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:21,520
Seok Jin was stepping on it, so I was watching him.

953
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,845
- You pushed me. - Let's go.

954
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:25,615
Let's check them.

955
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:29,245
"Gam". "Ssyal". "Sal".

956
00:34:29,737 --> 00:34:32,540
- You have none. Move. - I have none?

957
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,570
- Move, thief. - Me.

958
00:34:34,575 --> 00:34:36,385
(Come on.)

959
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:38,440
- You have "beans". - I got one.

960
00:34:38,446 --> 00:34:39,840
- "Billiard balls". - "Slippers".

961
00:34:39,847 --> 00:34:41,925
- Slippers. - Billiard balls.

962
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,465
"Dumbbells".

963
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:45,280
You have "beans".

964
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:47,280
You have "dumbbells" too. "Seaweed".

965
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:49,450
Haha got so many.

966
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:50,650
(He got the most.)

967
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:52,520
- Okay! - We have the results.

968
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:56,230
- Jae Seok, you can take out rice. - That's it?

969
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:59,800
- That was good though. It's 3kg. - You took out a lot. It's heavy.

970
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:02,230
- Kwang Soo, you took out beans. - Rice.

971
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:04,215
- I took out rice too. - You did?

972
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,815
- No, it's just beans. - When?

973
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,770
- It was "ssom". Was it "sap"? - It was "sap".

974
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:11,440
You didn't get rice.

975
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:13,180
Did you get rice?

976
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,510
- Yes. - He didn't.

977
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:18,080
- No. - He didn't get it.

978
00:35:18,086 --> 00:35:19,995
Everybody is saying no, but only you're saying yes.

979
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:21,780
Maybe it was somebody else's.

980
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,520
- That could be. - Is this a prank?

981
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:24,950
(He thinks it's unfair.)

982
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,520
It's not.

983
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,020
Nobody saw it?

984
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:29,490
Pranks are only for stars.

985
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:30,960
(He's kidding.)

986
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:33,730
Why would you say that?

987
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,045
What's wrong?

988
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:37,145
Someone might play a prank on me.

989
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:39,500
(Actually Kwang Soo...)

990
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:41,770
- Kwang Soo. - He has a lot.

991
00:35:41,776 --> 00:35:43,310
- He has rice. - He has rice.

992
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:47,125
(He did have rice.)

993
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:48,725
- Rice. - Okay.

994
00:35:50,184 --> 00:35:51,280
Is it really?

995
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,480
I got rid of it.

996
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:53,780
Kwang Soo got rid of it.

997
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:55,050
Kwang Soo.

998
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,750
- What? - Don't cry.

999
00:35:56,758 --> 00:35:57,965
(He gets teary.)

1000
00:35:58,526 --> 00:35:59,820
Tell us if you got rid of it.

1001
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:02,290
- Kwang Soo really got rid of it. - Take it out then.

1002
00:36:02,296 --> 00:36:03,690
He really did. He's crying.

1003
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:04,760
He's about to cry.

1004
00:36:04,766 --> 00:36:06,775
- Did you get rid of rice? - Are you sure?

1005
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,770
I definitely did, but everyone denies it.

1006
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,730
I have no idea now.

1007
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,600
- He really got rid of it. - I definitely did.

1008
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:14,170
- It was beans. - We'll count it.

1009
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:16,270
We'll take out rice and beans for Kwang Soo.

1010
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:17,970
Forget it.

1011
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:20,625
(He's upset.)

1012
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:23,480
If he didn't get rid of it, he's cheating.

1013
00:36:23,484 --> 00:36:24,880
You can punish him next week.

1014
00:36:24,886 --> 00:36:27,280
You have beans, so make yourself some rice with beans.

1015
00:36:27,288 --> 00:36:28,950
(Eat some rice with beans if you're lying.)

1016
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,205
If...

1017
00:36:30,658 --> 00:36:32,120
Will you make a big deal out of it?

1018
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:34,320
- He already is. - Will you?

1019
00:36:34,328 --> 00:36:36,860
Let's say we took rice out for Kwang Soo.

1020
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,260
If we find out next week that Kwang Soo didn't get rid of rice,

1021
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:42,570
make him carry 20kg of rice next week.

1022
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,730
- Let's do that. - Will you do it or not?

1023
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:46,015
I give up.

1024
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,200
Why?

1025
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,870
If not, give 20kg of rice to every staff member.

1026
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,780
- Why would I do that? - Do it.

1027
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,240
Why would I do that all of a sudden?

1028
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:55,810
- Next week... - You should do that.

1029
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:58,280
- Take out rice, beans, and weights. - Take them out.

1030
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:00,550
- You ruined everyone's mood now. - I'm sorry.

1031
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:02,080
(You ruined everyone's mood.)

1032
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,090
(Did I?)

1033
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,820
- I'm sorry. - What have you done?

1034
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm sorry.

1035
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,420
Whether you got rid of rice or not isn't important.

1036
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:10,230
Look at all the staff members.

1037
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:11,490
I'm sorry.

1038
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:12,600
(He apologizes.)

1039
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,930
(Teasing Kwang Soo is fun.)

1040
00:37:13,935 --> 00:37:15,160
- You can do it. - We'll do better.

1041
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,785
- Let's go. - Okay.

1042
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:19,400
(He's speechless.)

1043
00:37:19,407 --> 00:37:20,700
- I'm sorry. - You can do it.

1044
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:22,315
- We'll do better. - Let's go.

1045
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:24,955
Let's wrap it up. Take out rice from Kwang Soo.

1046
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,210
In that case, don't take it out.

1047
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:28,910
- Take it out. - Don't take out the rice.

1048
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:30,110
Just take it out.

1049
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,380
We'll make him carry it.

1050
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:33,080
That's right. It would be funny.

1051
00:37:33,087 --> 00:37:34,180
(Who got rid of what)

1052
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:35,650
- Do we throw it here? - Yes.

1053
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:36,750
It looks light.

1054
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:38,335
This will be possible.

1055
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:40,120
(It's time to throw their shoe bag.)

1056
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:41,190
- It's extremely heavy. - Mine is light.

1057
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,590
- It's quite heavy. - It's extremely heavy.

1058
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:45,875
This is perfect.

1059
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:47,430
I can't throw this.

1060
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,430
Who will start?

1061
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:51,345
Let's start with the one with the heaviest bag.

1062
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:52,855
Mine is the heaviest.

1063
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,170
Start with Seok Jin.

1064
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:55,910
- May I throw it like this? - Yes.

1065
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,840
- You can throw it however you want. - It might go farther if it's heavy.

1066
00:37:58,846 --> 00:37:59,980
Throw it like this.

1067
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:01,340
Like that?

1068
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:02,450
(It must stay within the left line.)

1069
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,480
If you think about it,

1070
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:05,380
we're all suffering because of Seok Jin's sticky fingers.

1071
00:38:05,386 --> 00:38:07,480
(He blames Seok Jin again.)

1072
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:09,605
Hey, it isn't me.

1073
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:13,020
What if he has shoes inside his bag?

1074
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,305
No way.

1075
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:15,530
Shall I start?

1076
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,805
You only get once chance.

1077
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:18,560
Move forward.

1078
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,560
You got it.

1079
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,145
(Throwing)

1080
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,030
(He throws it quite well.)

1081
00:38:23,037 --> 00:38:24,230
It went far.

1082
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,500
(It was a nice throw.)

1083
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:26,900
- It didn't make a difference. - Next is So Min.

1084
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:29,015
(Seok Jin's record is 6m.)

1085
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,740
It's so heavy.

1086
00:38:30,745 --> 00:38:32,580
Look at Se Chan.

1087
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,810
(It's Haha's turn who has the lightest bag.)

1088
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,410
Haha's bag is light.

1089
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:37,980
(He's full of confidence.)

1090
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,080
It's Bruce Lee.

1091
00:38:39,086 --> 00:38:40,965
His bag is so light.

1092
00:38:41,055 --> 00:38:42,180
It's perfect to throw.

1093
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,705
He'll throw it far.

1094
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:45,520
He has potential.

1095
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:48,490
(He goes for first place that will give him two hints.)

1096
00:38:48,496 --> 00:38:52,975
(Where far will Haha's bag travel?)

1097
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:55,260
(Flying)

1098
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:57,715
- Out. - It's out.

1099
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,085
(It's so light that it goes out.)

1100
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:03,970
(How did it go that far?)

1101
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,240
It's out.

1102
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:06,540
(He places last because his bag goes too far.)

1103
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:07,925
It's out.

1104
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,250
- Is it out? - Out.

1105
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,680
You were in first place.

1106
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:12,620
(Haha is eliminated.)

1107
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,450
- Does the first place get hints? - Yes.

1108
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:18,120
(Kwang Soo throws his bag without beans or rice.)

1109
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,520
It'd be funny if he hits his face with it.

1110
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:20,590
I know.

1111
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:23,390
(It'd be funny if he hits his face with it.)

1112
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:24,860
- He almost got tempted. - What?

1113
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,275
He got tempted.

1114
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,830
He might hit himself while swinging it.

1115
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:30,600
- Here I go. - Okay.

1116
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:31,930
(After the controversy over rice...)

1117
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,400
You can do it, Kwang Soo.

1118
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:36,510
(He goes for 2 hints.)

1119
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,140
(It flies off lightly without rice.)

1120
00:39:38,145 --> 00:39:39,280
Goodness.

1121
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,010
(It travels far.)

1122
00:39:42,016 --> 00:39:46,595
(Currently, he's the winner.)

1123
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:49,205
- Did he get rid of rice? - Did he really get rid of rice?

1124
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:50,720
Do you have to win?

1125
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:52,920
It's for the hint.

1126
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:54,790
Jong Kook's bag will go far.

1127
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:57,005
I don't know how I should throw it.

1128
00:39:57,465 --> 00:40:02,430
(They suspect that Jong Kook is putting on a show.)

1129
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:09,485
(If it's true, he'll work hard to keep the hints to himself.)

1130
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:14,425
(He becomes the winner without breaking a sweat.)

1131
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:17,910
(He throws a 5kg bag the farthest.)

1132
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,080
This isn't fun.

1133
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:20,580
(Come on.)

1134
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:21,965
Come on.

1135
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:24,165
- "This isn't fun"? - It isn't fun at all.

1136
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:25,960
I'm the winner.

1137
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,120
- What? - Why isn't it fun?

1138
00:40:27,128 --> 00:40:29,130
- It isn't fun at all. - What do you mean?

1139
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,560
- It went far. - It's not fun.

1140
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,260
It was thrown like Thor's hammer.

1141
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:34,760
Put back the rice in my bag.

1142
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:38,200
Jong Kook is the winner, and he gets the hints.

1143
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:39,340
May I see it?

1144
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,470
- No. - I'll discuss with you.

1145
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,270
- I'll discuss with you. - Let me look at it first.

1146
00:40:42,276 --> 00:40:44,340
- Let me see it. - Share it with us.

1147
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:45,880
This is...

1148
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,340
My goodness.

1149
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:50,065
(The ankles of the thief who's leaving the restaurant)

1150
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:53,080
Pull up your pants. Mine are thick.

1151
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,695
- Wait, like this? - Pull down the socks.

1152
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,450
Seok Jin's ankles are thin.

1153
00:40:58,459 --> 00:40:59,720
- Are they thin? - Look.

1154
00:40:59,727 --> 00:41:01,190
Wait, there's no hair on the legs.

1155
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:03,090
- Wait. - It's Seok Jin.

1156
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:04,460
- I got him. - I have a lot of hair.

1157
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:05,960
What do you mean I have no hair?

1158
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,230
- I have a lot of hair. - He doesn't.

1159
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:09,270
- I have a lot of hair. Look. - He doesn't.

1160
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,830
He has no hair at all.

1161
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:12,345
(His leg is clean without any hair.)

1162
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:13,770
(There's no hair at all.)

1163
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:15,200
I thought it was the leg of a newborn.

1164
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:17,340
- We got him. - We caught the thief.

1165
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,670
He has no hair.

1166
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,455
Get his water bomb penalty ready.

1167
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:22,110
Look at my hair.

1168
00:41:22,116 --> 00:41:23,550
(Isn't this a lot?)

1169
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:24,680
It's Seok Jin.

1170
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:27,250
Poor Seok Jin.

1171
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:28,595
Why did you do it?

1172
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:30,365
Even you'll find it strange.

1173
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,020
Isn't it like looking at the mirror?

1174
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:34,005
Let me see it.

1175
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:36,190
- It's definitely Seok Jin. - It's not me.

1176
00:41:36,197 --> 00:41:37,560
Here's your second hint.

1177
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,360
(The petty thief's hand holding a shoe)

1178
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,745
Who is that?

1179
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,470
Whose hand is that?

1180
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,315
(He shares the hint with everyone.)

1181
00:41:44,705 --> 00:41:46,100
It's definitely a man.

1182
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,770
- It's not a woman. - It's definitely a man.

1183
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:49,270
You never know, so check the women.

1184
00:41:49,276 --> 00:41:50,540
It's definitely a man's hand.

1185
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,840
Ji Hyo has manly hands.

1186
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:53,180
It looks like a man's hand.

1187
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,310
- Let me see. - Look at Ji Hyo's hand.

1188
00:41:54,315 --> 00:41:55,950
(The shape is similar, but her hand is thinner.)

1189
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,080
Her hand is too thin.

1190
00:41:57,084 --> 00:41:59,180
- Let's see So Min's hand. - It's a man's hand.

1191
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,450
It looks like hers.

1192
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:02,280
- No, it's not hers. - It's not her either.

1193
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:03,750
- This is... - It depends on the angle.

1194
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:06,220
It's hard to tell whether it's a man or a woman.

1195
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:07,420
- It's him. - Give it to him.

1196
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:09,790
(It's Seok Jin.)

1197
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:12,360
(Jong Kook suspects Seok Jin again.)

1198
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:15,445
(It's definitely suspicious now.)

1199
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:20,200
(After losing his shoes, he only suspects Seok Jin.)

1200
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,470
(Is it a plot between the two of them?)

1201
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:24,955
- It looks similar to his. - The elbow would make it easy.

1202
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:28,655
Let's go to the place where the last hint is.

1203
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:30,110
It's the last hint.

1204
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,695
It's the last mission.

1205
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:33,635
- It's a punching machine. - Punching machine?

1206
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:35,990
Does it give a lot of advantage to Jong Kook?

1207
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,020
Isn't this mission for Jong Kook?

1208
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:41,020
- Come on. - Jong Kook is good at it.

1209
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:42,490
Can we do this later?

1210
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,860
I'd like to punch the thief when we find him.

1211
00:42:44,865 --> 00:42:46,960
(He wants to punch the thief instead of the machine.)

1212
00:42:46,967 --> 00:42:48,330
- That means... - Punch the face?

1213
00:42:48,335 --> 00:42:51,015
Won't the water bomb penalty be enough?

1214
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,670
Why are we using that machine now?

1215
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,170
- You know this, right? - What?

1216
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:57,740
- The culprit is around the scene. - Right.

1217
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,240
Seok Jin has been next to Jong Kook all day.

1218
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:01,540
- He's been next to me all day. - That's true.

1219
00:43:01,549 --> 00:43:02,710
(They've been next to each other since this morning.)

1220
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:04,010
I'll share the hint.

1221
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,035
This is the final mission...

1222
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:08,250
in which you can win a determining hint.

1223
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:11,135
Here are the rules for Life is One Shot.

1224
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,520
If you know the answer to the question,

1225
00:43:13,527 --> 00:43:15,290
you get to hit the punching machine.

1226
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:17,960
The number of the 100th digit of your punching score...

1227
00:43:17,965 --> 00:43:19,460
will be your answer.

1228
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,660
- What? - It's hard to understand.

1229
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:22,730
Let's say your score was 350 points.

1230
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:25,400
Then your answer will be choice number three.

1231
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,655
(The answer is choice number 3.)

1232
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,470
- I see. - You have to punch well.

1233
00:43:29,476 --> 00:43:30,840
Punching as hard as possible isn't the answer.

1234
00:43:30,845 --> 00:43:32,240
- You have to try. - We never know.

1235
00:43:32,246 --> 00:43:34,410
You lose your chance when your answer is wrong.

1236
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,050
The winner gets two hints.

1237
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,210
(The winner gets 2 hints.)

1238
00:43:37,218 --> 00:43:40,550
2nd, 3rd, and 4th place get one hint.

1239
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:41,950
This is important.

1240
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:43,150
How many choices are there?

1241
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:44,820
Won't the answers be the last numbers?

1242
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,120
I can score from 700 to 800 points.

1243
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,090
Why are you posing like that?

1244
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,830
- Did you hurt your wrist? - No.

1245
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,060
- Yes? - Did you hurt yourself?

1246
00:43:52,066 --> 00:43:54,260
Those who are good at punching...

1247
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,660
(This is how they pose.)

1248
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:57,000
- What? - What?

1249
00:43:57,004 --> 00:43:59,030
People like me throw short punches.

1250
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,040
Why are you hiding it?

1251
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,900
You seem scared because you've never done it.

1252
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,370
The choices start from number three.

1253
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:06,655
The question is easy. It's easily seen in everyday life.

1254
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,325
In the word tangsuyuk,

1255
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:11,210
what does tang mean?

1256
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:12,495
What does tang mean?

1257
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:14,250
Tang.

1258
00:44:14,255 --> 00:44:16,465
Number three, fried.

1259
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:17,820
- I know. - I know.

1260
00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:21,290
(Jae Seok and Se Chan raise their hand.)

1261
00:44:21,295 --> 00:44:22,790
- May I try it right away? - Yes.

1262
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:24,090
- It means fried. - Fried.

1263
00:44:24,098 --> 00:44:25,660
Can't we hear the rest?

1264
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,475
The score must be in the 300s.

1265
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:30,345
- Is it tang? - Yes.

1266
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:32,015
Press the button.

1267
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,910
(He presses the start button.)

1268
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,170
(Why isn't it moving?)

1269
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,280
- Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

1270
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,810
- You have to punch it. - Haven't you done it before?

1271
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,810
He's never played with the punching machine.

1272
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:44,495
This is a speaker.

1273
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:46,720
- This is a speaker. - He's such an amateur.

1274
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,380
Why did you hit the speaker?

1275
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,950
- It's embarrassing that... - You're out.

1276
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:51,550
- I'm competing with you. - There's the button.

1277
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,035
For punchers like me...

1278
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:56,090
Does it have to be a three-digit number?

1279
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:57,590
- It has to be in the 300s. - In the 300s.

1280
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:58,975
It plays music.

1281
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:01,160
That's right.

1282
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,170
(He dances to the music.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1283
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,515
(He does the popular So Min's dance.)

1284
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:08,770
Dance with him.

1285
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:10,570
I'm addicted to So Min's dance.

1286
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:11,640
(So Min's dance is addicting.)

1287
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:14,040
I can't bear to watch him. It's terrible.

1288
00:45:14,048 --> 00:45:15,510
The score should be in the 300s.

1289
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:18,080
(He gives a try.)

1290
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:20,380
(Jae Seok's answer is number 3.)

1291
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,795
(Jae Seok's score should be in the 300s.)

1292
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:23,920
That's too weak.

1293
00:45:23,924 --> 00:45:25,265
It's 300 points.

1294
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,090
(His score goes into the 300s.)

1295
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:29,990
- It was too strong. - It went over.

1296
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:31,360
It's going over 600 points.

1297
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:33,460
(His score is 728 points.)

1298
00:45:33,467 --> 00:45:35,430
- His score is 728 points. - It came out to be 728 points?

1299
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:37,030
- It's 728 points. - Did I score that high?

1300
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,100
No way.

1301
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:40,115
It's hard to get a score in the 300s.

1302
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,670
Fail.

1303
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:43,940
Let's hear all the options.

1304
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:45,140
Here are the options.

1305
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:47,510
- Number three, "to fry". - Okay.

1306
00:45:47,514 --> 00:45:50,710
Number four, "to look like a gun".

1307
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,635
Number five, "to dip in the sauce".

1308
00:45:54,154 --> 00:45:57,235
Number six, "thick sauce".

1309
00:45:57,658 --> 00:45:59,820
Number seven, "soup".

1310
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,035
(Everything makes sense.)

1311
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:03,630
Number eight, "sweet".

1312
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,760
(I know.)

1313
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:06,200
So Min.

1314
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,930
So Min, which number?

1315
00:46:07,935 --> 00:46:09,730
- Number seven. - What was number seven?

1316
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:11,715
- "Soup". - "Soup"?

1317
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,200
Number seven.

1318
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:14,670
(So Min aims for a score in the 700s.)

1319
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:16,470
(Punch)

1320
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:17,670
That was strong.

1321
00:46:17,678 --> 00:46:19,640
- I hope it goes over 700 points. - It'll be in the 500s.

1322
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:20,840
- It's over 700 points. - It's still going up.

1323
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:22,240
It's perfect.

1324
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:23,910
- It's over 700 points. - It's perfect.

1325
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:25,410
(740 points)

1326
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:27,250
It's 740 points. It must be the right answer.

1327
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,850
Number seven, "soup".

1328
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,520
(Is "soup" the right answer?)

1329
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,620
- Me. - It's wrong?

1330
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:34,890
It must be number eight.

1331
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,730
You shouldn't punch it too hard.

1332
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,590
- It'll go over 900 points. - You should punch it hard.

1333
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,830
Number eight, "sweet".

1334
00:46:40,834 --> 00:46:42,460
- Even So Min went over 700 points. - Number eight, "sweet".

1335
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,030
Number eight, "sweet".

1336
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:45,500
(Haha aims for a score in the 800s.)

1337
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:46,915
That was too strong.

1338
00:46:47,775 --> 00:46:48,970
(His punch was very strong.)

1339
00:46:48,976 --> 00:46:50,670
- It was too strong. - No.

1340
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:52,140
- It'll be too high. - No.

1341
00:46:52,146 --> 00:46:53,440
His punch was...

1342
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:55,040
(It can't go over a score in the 800s.)

1343
00:46:55,049 --> 00:46:57,225
It's hard to go over 800 points.

1344
00:46:57,584 --> 00:46:59,380
We won't be able to give the right answer.

1345
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,580
- It has to be stronger. - We can't.

1346
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:02,265
He did his best.

1347
00:47:03,057 --> 00:47:04,050
His punch is so weak.

1348
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,420
It's so weak.

1349
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:07,735
Number eight, "sweet".

1350
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:09,790
You should punch it even harder.

1351
00:47:09,797 --> 00:47:11,605
Okay.

1352
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,030
That was nice. He definitely succeeded.

1353
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:16,030
(Se Chan punches it as hard as he can.)

1354
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:19,445
- You did a good job. - I hope it'll go over 800 points.

1355
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,770
I hope it goes over 900 points.

1356
00:47:21,775 --> 00:47:23,185
It's in the 800s.

1357
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:24,670
842 points.

1358
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:26,680
(His score is in the 800s.)

1359
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,210
- Okay. - What was your answer?

1360
00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:31,310
Number eight, "sweet".

1361
00:47:31,318 --> 00:47:33,420
(Is "sweet" the right answer?)

1362
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,695
Okay!

1363
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:36,550
It means "sweet"?

1364
00:47:36,557 --> 00:47:39,020
You have to punch it the right way too.

1365
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:41,090
It was "sweet".

1366
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:42,890
You need to punch it hard.

1367
00:47:42,896 --> 00:47:44,690
It was number eight.

1368
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:45,960
(Who will win the hint?)

1369
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:47,930
Here goes the second question.

1370
00:47:47,935 --> 00:47:51,630
"This" can include a lot more information than a barcode.

1371
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:54,285
It's a two-dimensional matrix code...

1372
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:56,000
and called QR code.

1373
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:59,940
QR stands for "something response".

1374
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:03,110
- Quantity. - What does Q stand for?

1375
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:04,280
Quan.

1376
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:06,180
Number three, "question".

1377
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:07,850
Number four, "quiet".

1378
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:09,180
Number five, "quick".

1379
00:48:09,189 --> 00:48:11,120
Number six, "quantity".

1380
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:12,920
Number seven, "quarter".

1381
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,620
Number eight, "quality".

1382
00:48:14,628 --> 00:48:16,845
- Number nine, "quest". - It must be "quality".

1383
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:18,760
- It must be number 9. - Number 9, "quest".

1384
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:20,360
- It's number nine. - "Quest"?

1385
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,060
But we can't go over 900 points.

1386
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,630
Number nine, "quest".

1387
00:48:23,637 --> 00:48:24,730
It's definitely number nine.

1388
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,000
They must want us to get more than 900 points.

1389
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:28,385
Okay.

1390
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,540
Can I use my legs?

1391
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:31,740
- It doesn't matter. - Which number?

1392
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,855
- It doesn't matter? - You're going to kick it?

1393
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:38,080
You'll hurt yourself. Just use your fist.

1394
00:48:38,085 --> 00:48:40,650
(Stop being ridiculous.)

1395
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:42,850
I don't want you to hurt yourself again.

1396
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:44,550
He keeps acting up.

1397
00:48:44,558 --> 00:48:46,620
With a flying knee...

1398
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:49,205
You almost hit your own head.

1399
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,275
Gosh.

1400
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:53,460
Can I do a turning kick?

1401
00:48:53,467 --> 00:48:55,730
- Gosh. Stop being absurd. - That's absurd.

1402
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:57,300
- You'll hurt yourself. - Absurd?

1403
00:48:57,304 --> 00:48:59,230
You'll hurt yourself. Calm down.

1404
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:01,200
I'll do this.

1405
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,200
All right.

1406
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:04,140
- Whatever. - Let me show you.

1407
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:06,355
Let's do something sitting down next week.

1408
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:09,510
(To get 900 points, Jae Seok prepares to do a knee kick.)

1409
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:11,725
(How strong will it be?)

1410
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:14,380
(Moaning)

1411
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:16,565
Gosh. What was that?

1412
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:19,150
(The results are just what everyone was expecting.)

1413
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:21,135
- What did you do? - What was that?

1414
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:24,760
- What was that? - What did you do?

1415
00:49:24,765 --> 00:49:26,900
A man should be able to go over 900 points. It's 634 points.

1416
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,930
(He fails with 634 points.)

1417
00:49:27,935 --> 00:49:28,930
Fail.

1418
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,330
It's number nine.

1419
00:49:30,337 --> 00:49:31,830
Are you sure it's number nine?

1420
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,900
- It's number nine. - "Quest response"...

1421
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:35,570
- makes sense. - We didn't have number nine before.

1422
00:49:35,576 --> 00:49:37,670
You should analyze the question.

1423
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,370
"Quantity" sounds cool.

1424
00:49:39,379 --> 00:49:41,455
- It sounds cool. - I want to try "quick".

1425
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:43,810
(Practicing)

1426
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,480
(Seok Jin is doing his best.)

1427
00:49:45,485 --> 00:49:47,450
Look what Seok Jin is doing.

1428
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,295
(Look what Seok Jin is doing.)

1429
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,050
What does "quantity" mean?

1430
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,135
Why isn't anyone watching Seok Jin?

1431
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:56,305
(Seok Jin pretends to be okay.)

1432
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,660
I hope some cameras are shooting me.

1433
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,360
(Seok Jin is ready to aim for 900 points.)

1434
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:02,245
It's better to use your elbow.

1435
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:06,315
(He almost missed it.)

1436
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:08,970
Gosh.

1437
00:50:08,976 --> 00:50:11,570
- I feel sorry for you. - Please be careful.

1438
00:50:11,578 --> 00:50:13,195
You'll hurt your shoulders.

1439
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:16,910
(Seok Jin fails with 592 points.)

1440
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:19,280
- Which number? - I want to try "quantity".

1441
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:20,380
- Go for it. - Try it.

1442
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,650
Number six.

1443
00:50:21,655 --> 00:50:23,450
- No. Number nine. - Like a man.

1444
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:24,820
- It must be number 9. - Number 9, "quest".

1445
00:50:24,825 --> 00:50:27,290
- You have to go for it. - You should go for it regardless.

1446
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:28,590
Of course.

1447
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:30,890
Gosh, stop being ridiculous.

1448
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:33,275
(What are you doing?)

1449
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:35,945
You should push it.

1450
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:38,900
Are you going to use that hand?

1451
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:42,670
I've seen this a lot since my school days.

1452
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:45,855
Bad fighters try many different positions.

1453
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:47,855
- Like this. - Good fighters...

1454
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:50,210
- Run from behind. - Good fighters...

1455
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,180
like Jong Kook need only one position.

1456
00:50:52,185 --> 00:50:53,495
(Good fighters need only one position.)

1457
00:50:54,288 --> 00:50:55,565
Here we go.

1458
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,350
Gosh, you must've gotten beaten up a lot.

1459
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:00,220
- That was nice. - That was strong.

1460
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:01,820
Gosh, you must've gotten beaten up a lot.

1461
00:51:01,828 --> 00:51:03,790
(He punched hard.)

1462
00:51:03,797 --> 00:51:05,960
- That was strong. - That was strong.

1463
00:51:05,966 --> 00:51:07,160
700? 800?

1464
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,830
- 817 points. - Even though it was that hard?

1465
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:10,530
- Should we push it harder? - It's so hard.

1466
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:12,200
No. You just have to punch it hard.

1467
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:13,985
Jong Kook.

1468
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,185
(It's finally his turn.)

1469
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,885
I'll try number nine.

1470
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:19,655
Number nine...

1471
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,655
It'd be funny if he fails.

1472
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:24,580
- That'd feel so good. - Right.

1473
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:25,680
You have a point.

1474
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:28,450
Is that how you do it?

1475
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:29,650
Aren't you going to hold your hand with the other hand?

1476
00:51:29,656 --> 00:51:30,920
- No. - Why...

1477
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:31,920
Why are you doing that?

1478
00:51:31,925 --> 00:51:33,220
Use your both hands.

1479
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:35,990
- Leave me alone. - That's how you do it.

1480
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:37,390
- What? - Be careful.

1481
00:51:37,397 --> 00:51:38,690
Be careful.

1482
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,360
His punch would knock you out.

1483
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:43,370
(He aims for 900 points with only 1 hand.)

1484
00:51:44,604 --> 00:51:47,607
(He aims for 900 points with only 1 hand.)

1485
00:51:47,607 --> 00:51:50,043
(Will his fist get a score in the 900s?)

1486
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,846
(Punch)

1487
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,649
- Gosh. - Your arm.

1488
00:51:55,649 --> 00:51:57,117
I'm okay.

1489
00:51:57,451 --> 00:52:00,487
(He hit it a bit low.)

1490
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:02,789
(The door of the machine opens up.)

1491
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,991
- It was hit a bit low. - I'm okay.

1492
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:06,526
(His score is...)

1493
00:52:06,526 --> 00:52:07,861
It didn't go over 900 points.

1494
00:52:07,861 --> 00:52:09,363
(He fails with 834 points.)

1495
00:52:09,496 --> 00:52:10,597
(Even Jong Kook failed to go over 900 points.)

1496
00:52:10,597 --> 00:52:12,065
It's okay.

1497
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:13,233
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

1498
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,701
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

1499
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:17,270
I choose number five.

1500
00:52:17,437 --> 00:52:18,939
- Number five. - "Quick".

1501
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,507
It's the only word you know.

1502
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,776
(What did he say?)

1503
00:52:22,776 --> 00:52:23,844
"Quick service".

1504
00:52:23,844 --> 00:52:25,445
I know what it means too. It means fast.

1505
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:26,847
It's not like that.

1506
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:28,949
The code is supposed to be quick.

1507
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:31,051
- She has a point. - It makes sense.

1508
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:35,355
- Number five... - I think it'll be fine.

1509
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:36,423
It'll be in the 500s.

1510
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:38,325
- It's too high. - It's 650 points.

1511
00:52:38,325 --> 00:52:39,593
This machine is weird.

1512
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:40,894
Don't you use the word "quest"...

1513
00:52:40,894 --> 00:52:42,763
when you play games?

1514
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:44,030
Move.

1515
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:45,866
What are you doing?

1516
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:47,033
(What are you doing?)

1517
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,335
- What? - Do you want to try?

1518
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,436
What?

1519
00:52:49,436 --> 00:52:51,238
- Get lost. - What?

1520
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:53,440
- Who are you? - You brat.

1521
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,742
- What? - Gosh.

1522
00:52:55,742 --> 00:52:57,244
Get out of my way.

1523
00:52:57,244 --> 00:52:59,279
- Move. - Move.

1524
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:00,680
Get out of my way.

1525
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:02,682
Gosh, these cowards.

1526
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:03,950
Move.

1527
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,552
(Cotton fist versus honey fist)

1528
00:53:07,087 --> 00:53:08,688
My answer is...

1529
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,223
Choose number nine if you're a man.

1530
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:11,858
- Number five, "quick". - Hey.

1531
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:14,161
- You're so low. - I was going to choose it anyway.

1532
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:15,796
- I was going to choose it. - Okay.

1533
00:53:15,796 --> 00:53:18,832
I was debating between number 5 and number 9.

1534
00:53:18,965 --> 00:53:21,268
- I was going to choose it. - Try it.

1535
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:22,836
(Will Kwang Soo get a score in the 500s?)

1536
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:24,070
- That was too weak. - It'll be in the 500s.

1537
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:25,505
- It's too weak. - It'll be enough.

1538
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:27,441
It was that weak before too. Look at that.

1539
00:53:27,441 --> 00:53:29,543
- Okay. - 507 points. Number 5, "quick".

1540
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,878
(Number 5, "quick")

1541
00:53:31,878 --> 00:53:34,047
Number five, "quick".

1542
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:35,582
Okay!

1543
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,050
(Correct)

1544
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,652
- See? - It was right.

1545
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:39,753
How did you know?

1546
00:53:39,753 --> 00:53:40,887
Ji Hyo.

1547
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:41,888
(Ji Hyo was right.)

1548
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,857
- It's supposed to be quick. - That's right.

1549
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:47,427
- It's quick. - QR codes are fast.

1550
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:49,129
I can't believe it.

1551
00:53:49,129 --> 00:53:50,864
Here goes the next question.

1552
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,500
One of the most famous 19th-century German philosophers,

1553
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,869
Friedrich Nietzsche, said this once.

1554
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,003
Friedrich.

1555
00:53:57,003 --> 00:53:59,439
"Marriage is a long 'This'".

1556
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:01,441
- Okay. - What is "This"?

1557
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:03,243
Seok Jin is a marriage expert.

1558
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,544
I'm an expert.

1559
00:54:04,678 --> 00:54:05,846
I think I know.

1560
00:54:05,846 --> 00:54:07,347
What are you doing?

1561
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:08,348
Hold on.

1562
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:12,352
Number 3, "conversation". Number 4, "voyage".

1563
00:54:12,919 --> 00:54:16,623
Number 7, "sigh". Number 8, "fight".

1564
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,792
- I've heard about it. - "Grave" isn't one of the answers?

1565
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:20,627
(Why isn't "grave" one of the answers?)

1566
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:22,362
- Why is it a grave? - Seok Jin.

1567
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,598
What do you mean?

1568
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:25,899
(There should be "grave".)

1569
00:54:25,899 --> 00:54:28,301
It's usually among the possible answers, but it's missing.

1570
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:30,770
I know this right away.

1571
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,740
- Move over. - Why is he at the front?

1572
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,709
(I'm first.)

1573
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,278
- I lined up. - I was here first.

1574
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:39,779
- Why does he keep cutting? - What was that?

1575
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:41,581
I lined up.

1576
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:44,050
Move over when I tell you nicely.

1577
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:46,887
I'm going to do my move.

1578
00:54:46,887 --> 00:54:49,022
Hey, Protruding Lips. Move.

1579
00:54:49,022 --> 00:54:50,790
(You're being noisy.)

1580
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,094
(Let's see. Did you say, "Protruding Lips"?)

1581
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:56,396
Move over when I tell you nicely.

1582
00:54:56,596 --> 00:54:58,098
I'd rather not use my fist.

1583
00:54:58,398 --> 00:55:00,867
(Look at these people.)

1584
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:02,102
Come if you want to fight.

1585
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:05,005
(Come if you want to fight.)

1586
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:07,407
So Min, go.

1587
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:10,410
(So Min is enough. She's in the same weight division.)

1588
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,879
(Is it just you?)

1589
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:15,048
Hold on. Sir.

1590
00:55:15,048 --> 00:55:16,850
(Or were you looking for me?)

1591
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,352
- Not you, sir. - You told me to come out.

1592
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,255
- Not you. - My elbows.

1593
00:55:22,255 --> 00:55:24,391
- What are you doing? - Me too.

1594
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:27,694
If those two fight, I'll let my nephew join in.

1595
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:29,596
He's two right now. I want to let him fight.

1596
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:31,364
(Once he starts walking, it's doable.)

1597
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,767
- My nephew... - Stop it.

1598
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:35,802
- I suggest my mom. - Stop it.

1599
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:37,404
(Jae Seok gets moved to the end.)

1600
00:55:37,404 --> 00:55:40,473
"Sigh" seems likely too.

1601
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:43,043
It's "sigh" or "fight". It can't be number six.

1602
00:55:43,043 --> 00:55:44,477
(He's certain.)

1603
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:46,379
- I think it's "conversation". - It's a paradise,

1604
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:49,849
but it doesn't last long. It is paradise.

1605
00:55:50,317 --> 00:55:52,986
- Seok Jin, is it temporary? - Yes.

1606
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:56,289
- It doesn't last. - When is it a paradise?

1607
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,691
- It doesn't last. - When does it end?

1608
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:00,193
There are moments in the middle.

1609
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:03,263
- That's right. - How can you live without them?

1610
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:05,098
- It's like a desert in the oasis. - That's true.

1611
00:56:05,098 --> 00:56:06,433
(It's like a desert in the oasis.)

1612
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:08,168
- I mean an oasis... - What did you say?

1613
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:10,270
(It's an oasis in the desert.)

1614
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,205
- What did you say? - It's an oasis in the desert.

1615
00:56:12,205 --> 00:56:14,808
- I think it's "conversation". - It's a rest station on a highway.

1616
00:56:14,808 --> 00:56:16,776
There are moments of paradise in between.

1617
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:19,846
I think it's "conversation". Hold on.

1618
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:22,315
Why is he here?

1619
00:56:22,315 --> 00:56:23,817
(Why is he here?)

1620
00:56:23,817 --> 00:56:25,251
(Didn't he get caught cutting the line and had to move?)

1621
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:27,320
I thought I was mistaken.

1622
00:56:28,855 --> 00:56:31,691
(He got caught cutting in 3 minutes ago.)

1623
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,893
(He moved back slowly.)

1624
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:35,629
Number four. I thought it was "voyage".

1625
00:56:35,629 --> 00:56:37,797
(He slipped in halfway.)

1626
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:41,101
(Great. That was smooth.)

1627
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:43,403
Hey, why are you standing here?

1628
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:46,172
I'm always in front of Seok Jin.

1629
00:56:46,172 --> 00:56:48,675
- Why? Move back. - Come here.

1630
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:50,810
- I... - Why are you standing there?

1631
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,279
Seok Jin was always behind me.

1632
00:56:53,279 --> 00:56:54,781
- You can't do that. - That was earlier.

1633
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:57,350
You two should move back then.

1634
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:00,120
- Oh, gosh. What are you doing? - Why me?

1635
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,988
- He's always behind me. - Gosh.

1636
00:57:01,988 --> 00:57:04,290
- That was weird. He was here. - Why?

1637
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:05,792
- This is weird. - Kwang Soo.

1638
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,994
- Answer. Number seven, "sigh". - "Sigh".

1639
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:11,464
You have to get 700 points. It has to be strong.

1640
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:12,766
(Punching)

1641
00:57:12,766 --> 00:57:15,802
- That's enough. You'll get it. - You'll get over 700 points.

1642
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:18,004
- It's 800. - Is it?

1643
00:57:18,004 --> 00:57:19,906
- Move. - You have no excuse, right?

1644
00:57:19,906 --> 00:57:22,208
Goodness. It feels good though.

1645
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:23,610
(He's happy he got over 800 points.)

1646
00:57:23,643 --> 00:57:25,812
Number three, "conversation".

1647
00:57:25,812 --> 00:57:27,914
(Friedrich Nietzsche said this once. "Marriage is a long 'This'".)

1648
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:29,849
That's good. It will start with three.

1649
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:30,917
(So Min is weak, so she aims for 300 points.)

1650
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,218
Number three?

1651
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,654
Number three, "conversation".

1652
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:37,957
"Marriage is a long conversation."

1653
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:39,292
It's wrong.

1654
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:40,493
(It's correct.)

1655
00:57:40,827 --> 00:57:42,295
It's right.

1656
00:57:42,295 --> 00:57:43,897
- Do you have so much to say? - I was at the end.

1657
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:46,299
You talk it out and love each other.

1658
00:57:46,299 --> 00:57:48,068
There's not much to talk about.

1659
00:57:48,368 --> 00:57:50,870
From the fifth year, you don't talk much.

1660
00:57:51,037 --> 00:57:52,472
That's odd. Long conversations?

1661
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:53,973
("Marriage is a long conversation." So Min takes 1 point.)

1662
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,310
- Here's the last question. - Okay.

1663
00:57:57,944 --> 00:58:01,915
The Chinese character "Soo" is made up of three components.

1664
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:04,150
- What does it mean? - Three components?

1665
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:06,753
Number three, "rock-paper-scissors".

1666
00:58:06,753 --> 00:58:08,822
Number four, "let's go".

1667
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:10,890
Number five, "collaboration".

1668
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:15,395
Number 6, "division of labor". Number 7, "love triangle".

1669
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:18,698
Number 8, "pickpocketing". Number 9, "gloves".

1670
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:21,735
(What does the Chinese character "Soo" mean?)

1671
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:23,269
It's number three, "rock-paper-scissors".

1672
00:58:24,237 --> 00:58:25,472
"Rock-paper-scissors".

1673
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,075
(Tapping)

1674
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:32,579
(The machine didn't know it was punched.)

1675
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:34,414
- I didn't do it. - You did.

1676
00:58:34,414 --> 00:58:36,850
- Move. - Move.

1677
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,718
You did it.

1678
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:40,687
Number three is not easy.

1679
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,623
Doesn't number five sound okay? "Collaboration"?

1680
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:46,626
Number five, "collaboration".

1681
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,394
(Punching)

1682
00:58:48,394 --> 00:58:49,763
- Was it too hard? - That was too weak.

1683
00:58:49,763 --> 00:58:52,098
- He got it. - 547 points.

1684
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:53,566
- "Collaboration". - How's this possible?

1685
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:56,636
Your answer is "collaboration".

1686
00:58:57,003 --> 00:58:58,805
- It's wrong. - Oh, gosh.

1687
00:58:58,805 --> 00:59:01,708
- I... - That wasn't it.

1688
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,510
(Oh, gosh.)

1689
00:59:04,043 --> 00:59:06,379
Why do you sound so sad?

1690
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:09,415
- You guessed anyways. - What do you mean?

1691
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:10,884
Jae Seok gets it wrong every time,

1692
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,919
and he always gets sad. I find it funny.

1693
00:59:13,086 --> 00:59:15,789
He's always like, "That wasn't it."

1694
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:18,491
He tricks me every time. I feel like he knows.

1695
00:59:19,159 --> 00:59:21,094
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

1696
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:23,463
I'll go with number four, "let's go".

1697
00:59:23,463 --> 00:59:25,231
(He hesitated.)

1698
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:27,400
- "Let's go"? - It can't be.

1699
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,768
That's farfetched.

1700
00:59:29,002 --> 00:59:30,904
- That doesn't sound right. - Hey.

1701
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:32,906
It's kind of tricky.

1702
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,041
He's so dumb.

1703
00:59:35,308 --> 00:59:37,043
I wasn't going to say this.

1704
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:39,179
- That wasn't nice. - I'm sorry.

1705
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:41,614
- I hesitated too. - I'm sorry.

1706
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:43,983
They made it 2,000 years ago. Will they say,

1707
00:59:43,983 --> 00:59:44,984
"let's go"?

1708
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:47,020
(Let's go.)

1709
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,388
What's that?

1710
00:59:48,521 --> 00:59:50,190
(Teasing)

1711
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:53,026
China took on English early.

1712
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:54,828
Hey, you never know.

1713
00:59:54,828 --> 00:59:57,163
Maybe it means something different.

1714
00:59:57,163 --> 00:59:58,731
I think it's "rock-paper-scissors".

1715
00:59:58,731 --> 01:00:00,767
I think Seok Jin...

1716
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:04,103
- never got a question right. - It's important to try.

1717
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:06,306
- True. - He's positive.

1718
01:00:06,306 --> 01:00:08,741
- He's so positive. - He turned very positive.

1719
01:00:08,741 --> 01:00:11,511
- Number four, "let's go". - It might mean something.

1720
01:00:11,511 --> 01:00:12,712
I'll go.

1721
01:00:14,247 --> 01:00:16,382
- It's too weak. - He got it.

1722
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:19,652
It's over 500. I did this, yet it's over 500 points.

1723
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:21,588
- You have to hit it. - That didn't work.

1724
01:00:22,388 --> 01:00:25,091
Punch it. It's "rock-paper-scissors".

1725
01:00:25,091 --> 01:00:28,595
Answer. Number four, "let's go".

1726
01:00:28,728 --> 01:00:31,197
Wait. You said I was dumb.

1727
01:00:31,197 --> 01:00:33,099
- You said I was dumb. - Jong Kook said it might be right.

1728
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:34,767
You're so funny. You said I was dumb.

1729
01:00:34,767 --> 01:00:38,104
That's not nice. You said I was dumb.

1730
01:00:38,104 --> 01:00:40,840
It's not "let's go", but it probably means that.

1731
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:42,809
I didn't think about that.

1732
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:45,011
Number four, "let's go".

1733
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,981
(Kwang Soo wants a score in the 400s.)

1734
01:00:48,214 --> 01:00:49,782
This won't work.

1735
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:51,384
- He got it. - Okay. It's 417 points.

1736
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:52,452
(He tries answer number 4 with 417 points.)

1737
01:00:52,452 --> 01:00:54,287
If this is the answer, I'd be shocked.

1738
01:00:54,387 --> 01:00:56,689
Number four, "let's go".

1739
01:00:56,689 --> 01:01:00,827
(Will Kwang Soo steal the answer again?)

1740
01:01:01,261 --> 01:01:03,263
- It's wrong. Think about it. - No way.

1741
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:05,164
You're so dumb.

1742
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:07,267
You're so dumb. Number four, "let's go"?

1743
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:09,802
- Maybe it's something similar. - You're so dumb.

1744
01:01:09,802 --> 01:01:11,804
- How dumb. - Gosh, Jong Kook said it could be.

1745
01:01:11,804 --> 01:01:13,973
How dumb.

1746
01:01:14,107 --> 01:01:15,541
Is Seok Jin supposed to be there?

1747
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:17,610
(What?)

1748
01:01:17,944 --> 01:01:20,780
(Seok Jin cuts in the line and gets caught.)

1749
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:22,649
(He's shameless.)

1750
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:24,918
- What are you doing here? - Jae Seok is always in front of me.

1751
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:26,986
(He's confident.)

1752
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:29,289
- Move. - Move, both of you.

1753
01:01:29,289 --> 01:01:31,524
- You're not there. - What are you talking about?

1754
01:01:31,524 --> 01:01:33,493
- Move. What are you doing there? - What's wrong?

1755
01:01:33,493 --> 01:01:35,795
- Move. - He's ridiculous.

1756
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,664
- Seok Jin. - He's right.

1757
01:01:38,097 --> 01:01:40,733
- He's always behind me. - It was So Min.

1758
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,569
Right. I forgot too. That was so natural.

1759
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,838
What's wrong? Jae Seok is always before me.

1760
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,573
It's "gloves" or "rock-paper-scissors".

1761
01:01:47,573 --> 01:01:50,476
Wait. Is he supposed to be there?

1762
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,312
(Is this his turn?)

1763
01:01:52,312 --> 01:01:53,513
Is he supposed to be there?

1764
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,382
(He stood in line, and it's finally his turn.)

1765
01:01:56,516 --> 01:02:00,086
- Is this right? - I'm not sure.

1766
01:02:00,086 --> 01:02:01,688
What are you talking about?

1767
01:02:01,688 --> 01:02:03,990
- Move. - Move.

1768
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,893
- I don't know. Move. - Hey! You're crazy.

1769
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:09,095
- Move. - Move.

1770
01:02:09,095 --> 01:02:11,397
- Why are you not saying anything? - It's So Min's turn.

1771
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:13,366
- I waited. - He was before me.

1772
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:16,302
I stood in line. So Min.

1773
01:02:16,302 --> 01:02:17,937
I stood in line and got here, right?

1774
01:02:17,937 --> 01:02:20,106
- I don't remember. - Move.

1775
01:02:20,106 --> 01:02:21,307
(I don't remember.)

1776
01:02:21,307 --> 01:02:23,543
(Move back, old man.)

1777
01:02:23,543 --> 01:02:25,578
- Move. - This is right.

1778
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:26,779
(I don't remember anything.)

1779
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:29,382
- My gosh. - This is right.

1780
01:02:29,382 --> 01:02:32,085
- You have to move. - I'm speechless.

1781
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:34,387
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin reunite at the back of the line.)

1782
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:36,990
- Ji Hyo mentioned something. - Try "love triangle".

1783
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,293
It might be "pickpocketing" because you use hands.

1784
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:42,095
There are many "hands" in the character.

1785
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:44,030
It could be "pickpocketing".

1786
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,466
I'll go with number eight, "pickpocketing".

1787
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:50,169
- You'll get it. - He got it.

1788
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:52,638
- Okay, that's good. It's 822. - 822 points.

1789
01:02:52,805 --> 01:02:54,674
Number eight, "pickpocketing".

1790
01:02:54,674 --> 01:02:57,010
If Se Chan is right, he wins.

1791
01:02:57,010 --> 01:02:59,212
There was no pickpocketing in the old days.

1792
01:02:59,212 --> 01:03:01,914
- No, that's not it. - It makes sense.

1793
01:03:02,749 --> 01:03:03,783
Okay!

1794
01:03:03,783 --> 01:03:05,385
(Number 8, "pickpocketing" is correct.)

1795
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:07,954
(It was "pickpocketing"?)

1796
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:09,989
- See? - Thank you, Ji Hyo.

1797
01:03:10,556 --> 01:03:13,559
You use your hands, so it's "pickpocketing"?

1798
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:15,895
- She got all the questions right. - She did.

1799
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:18,765
- She told me. - She's the queen of quizzes.

1800
01:03:18,765 --> 01:03:20,900
- She's the queen. - She is.

1801
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,901
Ji Hyo.

1802
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:23,469
(Thank you, Ji Hyo.)

1803
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,904
(Thanks to Ji Hyo, he wins with two points.)

1804
01:03:24,904 --> 01:03:29,042
Se Chan got two questions right, so he wins.

1805
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,744
He'll take two hints.

1806
01:03:32,378 --> 01:03:35,415
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo,

1807
01:03:35,415 --> 01:03:38,684
So Min, you got one question right. Please come forward.

1808
01:03:38,684 --> 01:03:40,386
- There's something for us too. - There must be.

1809
01:03:40,386 --> 01:03:43,990
- Maybe we get 1 hint. - I get 2.

1810
01:03:45,024 --> 01:03:46,692
Oh, gosh.

1811
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,028
(1st and 2nd place get to see the 1st hint.)

1812
01:03:49,028 --> 01:03:51,297
- It's a hand. - It's a female.

1813
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:52,732
- It's a female. - It's a woman's hand?

1814
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:54,267
- That's right. - It's a woman's hand.

1815
01:03:54,267 --> 01:03:55,935
There's something here.

1816
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:57,103
There's something on the wrist.

1817
01:03:57,103 --> 01:03:58,304
(Is the thief one of the ladies?)

1818
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:00,139
- There's something. - Let's see, So Min.

1819
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:04,410
- So Min. - She didn't want to show me.

1820
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,013
Oh, dear. It's the same.

1821
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:08,948
- It's her. - Is it her?

1822
01:04:08,948 --> 01:04:10,049
It has to be her.

1823
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:11,984
(They start thinking she's the thief.)

1824
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:13,186
It's her.

1825
01:04:13,186 --> 01:04:14,921
- It's not me. - Did we test her earlier?

1826
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:17,557
- Let me see. - We did.

1827
01:04:17,557 --> 01:04:19,358
- Let's see. - It's So Min.

1828
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:21,694
That's why she gave me a flower.

1829
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:22,895
Is it So Min?

1830
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:24,130
(Kwang Soo is surprised by something.)

1831
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,698
It must be her.

1832
01:04:25,698 --> 01:04:26,732
Is it you?

1833
01:04:26,732 --> 01:04:29,302
- Our signatures were on the wall. - What?

1834
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:30,970
- Our signatures are attached. - I know. Hurry.

1835
01:04:31,237 --> 01:04:34,540
("Our signatures"?)

1836
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:38,678
(At a cafe near the opening site an hour before the shoot)

1837
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:41,514
(Someone tall approaches one hour before the shoot.)

1838
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:42,815
Hello.

1839
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,618
- Hello. - Hello.

1840
01:04:45,618 --> 01:04:48,287
(Is it Kwang Soo?)

1841
01:04:48,287 --> 01:04:51,224
There's a reason why we called you earlier.

1842
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,359
You'll play an important role today.

1843
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,760
You'll be the petty thief.

1844
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:56,362
I like that it's an important role,

1845
01:04:56,362 --> 01:04:58,231
but what kind of name is that?

1846
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:00,733
Before I tell you a hidden rule,

1847
01:05:00,733 --> 01:05:03,002
there's a member who will accompany you.

1848
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:04,737
Is it a guest?

1849
01:05:05,271 --> 01:05:07,507
(Is there a guest?)

1850
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,443
(Another petty thief comes in.)

1851
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,844
Hello.

1852
01:05:11,844 --> 01:05:15,715
(The second petty thief is Se Chan.)

1853
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:17,917
- Hello. - I'm not alone.

1854
01:05:18,651 --> 01:05:20,820
What? Why are you here?

1855
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,122
It could be nerve-racking if I were alone,

1856
01:05:23,122 --> 01:05:24,257
but I'm confident with another person.

1857
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,859
- Is it the two of us? - We're petty thieves.

1858
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:28,161
Really?

1859
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:30,696
Being a petty thief doesn't fit me.

1860
01:05:31,197 --> 01:05:32,932
- I steal big things. - I don't think...

1861
01:05:32,932 --> 01:05:34,600
the title is important.

1862
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,502
(They resemble the thieves from "Home Alone".)

1863
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:39,472
What's going on?

1864
01:05:39,472 --> 01:05:40,740
- What? - What?

1865
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,175
- Hello. - Hello, Jae Seok.

1866
01:05:42,175 --> 01:05:43,242
What brings you here?

1867
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:45,111
- Jae Seok, you shouldn't be here. - What?

1868
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:46,812
He seems like a petty thief.

1869
01:05:46,812 --> 01:05:49,015
I think all of us are.

1870
01:05:49,015 --> 01:05:50,550
Are all of us thieves?

1871
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,052
Now I understand. All the pieces are coming together.

1872
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,253
We don't have time.

1873
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:56,689
So Min, what are you doing?

1874
01:05:56,689 --> 01:05:59,725
(All 7 members are petty thieves.)

1875
01:06:00,026 --> 01:06:01,861
The official rule is...

1876
01:06:01,861 --> 01:06:04,797
catching the petty thief.

1877
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:08,000
This is a special prepared for those...

1878
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,938
who couldn't defeat Jong Kook no matter what.

1879
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:14,774
It's 7 against 1, Catch Kim Jong Kook.

1880
01:06:14,774 --> 01:06:16,742
- That's offensive. - It's offensive.

1881
01:06:16,742 --> 01:06:19,178
It's 7 against 1, Catch Kim Jong Kook.

1882
01:06:19,178 --> 01:06:21,647
- That's offensive. - It's offensive. It's 7 against 1.

1883
01:06:21,647 --> 01:06:23,683
- 7 against 1 is too much. - I know.

1884
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:25,518
I wouldn't feel good even if we won.

1885
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:27,086
You're looking down on us.

1886
01:06:27,086 --> 01:06:29,355
- Winning won't worth anything. - It'd be obvious.

1887
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:33,359
All of you must hide the fact that you're thieves.

1888
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,195
During the final vote, only Jong Kook's vote will be effective.

1889
01:06:36,195 --> 01:06:37,997
Unless Jong Kook figures all of you out,

1890
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,366
Jong Kook will get the water bomb penalty.

1891
01:06:40,366 --> 01:06:43,736
You'll get a pair of shoes with a design of your choice.

1892
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,304
A design of our choice?

1893
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:47,740
It'd be funny to see Jong Kook get the water bomb penalty.

1894
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,076
However, if Jong Kook figures it out,

1895
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:52,111
only Jong Kook will get a new pair of shoes.

1896
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:54,013
All of you will get the water bomb penalty.

1897
01:06:54,013 --> 01:06:57,283
- One will be flogged by Jong Kook. - Flogged?

1898
01:06:57,283 --> 01:06:59,552
We have to make Jong Kook like us.

1899
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:02,622
- We already chose our leader. - Who?

1900
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:03,956
It's Seok Jin.

1901
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:06,692
- He's the eldest. - He is.

1902
01:07:06,692 --> 01:07:09,128
- It's obvious. - Me?

1903
01:07:09,428 --> 01:07:12,398
What you must steal is Jong Kook's shoes.

1904
01:07:12,398 --> 01:07:13,599
- What? - What?

1905
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,834
His shoes?

1906
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:17,603
As soon as we start the show,

1907
01:07:17,603 --> 01:07:20,406
you will enjoy a meal together.

1908
01:07:20,406 --> 01:07:23,009
While you're eating, steal Jong Kook's shoes.

1909
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:25,978
Hide the shoes in the assigned vehicle without being caught.

1910
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:27,913
- Are we a team? - Yes.

1911
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:29,915
Isn't that too easy?

1912
01:07:29,915 --> 01:07:33,319
However, you must steal 1 by 1 in a relay.

1913
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:36,489
(They must steal in a relay.)

1914
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:39,292
One person picks up Jong Kook's shoes from the floor.

1915
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:41,661
Then he puts them on the top shelf.

1916
01:07:41,661 --> 01:07:44,730
The next person moves them one shelf down.

1917
01:07:44,897 --> 01:07:47,967
The last person moves them to the vehicle.

1918
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:49,468
(The seventh person moves the shoes to the car.)

1919
01:07:49,468 --> 01:07:51,704
- We'll definitely be caught. - Definitely.

1920
01:07:51,704 --> 01:07:53,105
We'll be caught from the start.

1921
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:55,374
Jong Kook will pressure us.

1922
01:07:55,374 --> 01:07:56,976
Keep a poker face.

1923
01:07:56,976 --> 01:07:59,211
You'd better be careful, Seok Jin.

1924
01:07:59,879 --> 01:08:01,814
Gosh, I'm already stressed out.

1925
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:04,317
Get ready for an additional shoot.

1926
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,386
We'll be caught during the opening.

1927
01:08:07,987 --> 01:08:09,255
(The hidden mission starts.)

1928
01:08:09,255 --> 01:08:11,691
- What's this? - Is it a restaurant?

1929
01:08:12,191 --> 01:08:15,027
We usually open the show in the yard. This is refreshing.

1930
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:16,662
I'll put your shoes up here.

1931
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:17,763
Thank you.

1932
01:08:17,763 --> 01:08:18,998
(He suspects nothing.)

1933
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:20,166
Put them here.

1934
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:22,368
(Haha puts his shoes on the top shelf.)

1935
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:25,971
(So Min moves them one shelf down.)

1936
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,909
There's no water. I'll bring some.

1937
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:32,011
I'll bring some water.

1938
01:08:32,011 --> 01:08:35,147
(Ji Hyo successfully moves them down.)

1939
01:08:35,381 --> 01:08:36,682
Does anyone want more rice?

1940
01:08:36,682 --> 01:08:38,084
- I do. - Give it to me.

1941
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:40,353
- Excuse me. - Just a little.

1942
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:43,522
(The fourth member, Se Chan succeeds.)

1943
01:08:44,223 --> 01:08:48,728
(The 5th and 6th petty thieves succeed.)

1944
01:08:48,728 --> 01:08:51,897
(I think we'll easily succeed.)

1945
01:08:51,897 --> 01:08:53,866
(Only Seok Jin remains.)

1946
01:08:53,866 --> 01:08:55,501
- Is there nurungji? - Ask.

1947
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:58,304
Tell me to go when I call the waitress.

1948
01:08:59,171 --> 01:09:02,441
- Is there nurungji? - Really? Thank you.

1949
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:04,543
Go get it, Seok Jin.

1950
01:09:04,543 --> 01:09:05,644
Wait.

1951
01:09:05,644 --> 01:09:07,380
(He looks for the waitress while pretending to be angry.)

1952
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,215
(Why is he getting nurungji all of a sudden?)

1953
01:09:09,215 --> 01:09:11,250
Am I the last one?

1954
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,585
Where's the car?

1955
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:13,719
(Seok Jin is excited to be the last thief.)

1956
01:09:13,719 --> 01:09:14,987
Am I the last?

1957
01:09:14,987 --> 01:09:16,222
When did the others go?

1958
01:09:16,956 --> 01:09:18,724
I didn't know that I was the last one.

1959
01:09:18,724 --> 01:09:19,759
Do I put them here?

1960
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,127
(The petty thieves succeed in stealing his shoes.)

1961
01:09:21,394 --> 01:09:25,131
(The petty thieves' fight for hints starts.)

1962
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:29,802
(What does the photo of the ankles really mean?)

1963
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:32,571
(Whose ankles are these?)

1964
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:34,673
(It's the eldest petty thief, Seok Jin.)

1965
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:37,476
(There's another big secret.)

1966
01:09:38,077 --> 01:09:42,081
(The other shoes indicate that there are six other thieves.)

1967
01:09:42,615 --> 01:09:45,284
(Whose elbow is it under the umbrella?)

1968
01:09:45,284 --> 01:09:47,086
(It's Se Chan.)

1969
01:09:47,086 --> 01:09:50,990
(7 colors indicate 7 petty thieves.)

1970
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,926
(Who's holding the white shoe?)

1971
01:09:53,926 --> 01:09:56,162
(It's Kwang Soo.)

1972
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:01,167
(These indicate six other thieves.)

1973
01:10:01,534 --> 01:10:03,836
(Whose female hand is it that is signing?)

1974
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:05,838
(It's Ji Hyo.)

1975
01:10:07,173 --> 01:10:10,743
(7 frames of signature indicate 7 thieves.)

1976
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,079
(Jong Kook sees the signature hint.)

1977
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:16,415
Gosh, So Min. Give it to me.

1978
01:10:16,415 --> 01:10:18,984
- Our signatures are attached. - What?

1979
01:10:18,984 --> 01:10:21,120
- Our signatures are attached. - I know.

1980
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,888
(What should we do?)

1981
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:26,125
Why are you crumpling it up? Why are you trying to eat it?

1982
01:10:26,125 --> 01:10:27,793
It must be So Min.

1983
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,161
(Is So Min also a petty thief?)

1984
01:10:29,161 --> 01:10:30,496
- Let me see your foot. - I'm not it.

1985
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:31,530
Let me see your foot.

1986
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,666
All of our signatures are in the hint.

1987
01:10:34,133 --> 01:10:35,468
All of our signatures are in it.

1988
01:10:35,468 --> 01:10:38,771
I'll give another hint to Se Chan.

1989
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:40,706
(Se Chan gets an additional hint.)

1990
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:44,710
(It looks like So Min's eye.)

1991
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:48,681
(A silhouette of six other thieves is reflected in the eye.)

1992
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,883
The hint tells almost all.

1993
01:10:51,784 --> 01:10:54,086
- May I show it to everyone? - Can't I see it?

1994
01:10:54,186 --> 01:10:55,821
- It's up to you. - We can see it.

1995
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:57,323
Wait, come here.

1996
01:10:57,323 --> 01:10:59,658
- Wait a minute. - I can see it, can't I?

1997
01:10:59,658 --> 01:11:01,927
- You can show it to me. - No, wait.

1998
01:11:01,927 --> 01:11:03,429
- You go away. - What about me?

1999
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:04,763
You can look. Wait.

2000
01:11:04,763 --> 01:11:06,432
(What kind of hint is it?)

2001
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:08,000
Wait, you come here.

2002
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:11,203
- The two of you wait. - Why?

2003
01:11:11,303 --> 01:11:12,571
(He pretends not to be a thief.)

2004
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:14,573
- Let's take a look. - Let's see.

2005
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:16,509
- Gosh. - What's this?

2006
01:11:16,675 --> 01:11:18,377
It's So Min's eye.

2007
01:11:18,611 --> 01:11:21,313
- Let's see. Don't come near. - It's not me.

2008
01:11:21,313 --> 01:11:23,148
- It's So Min. - It has a double eyelid.

2009
01:11:23,148 --> 01:11:25,417
- It's definitely So Min. - You have double eyelids.

2010
01:11:25,484 --> 01:11:27,086
- It's So Min. - It has a double eyelid.

2011
01:11:27,086 --> 01:11:28,787
It's definitely So Min.

2012
01:11:28,787 --> 01:11:30,422
- There are shadows inside. - Right.

2013
01:11:30,422 --> 01:11:32,391
I see some shadows.

2014
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:33,993
Isn't there a silhouette?

2015
01:11:35,694 --> 01:11:40,366
(What? Se Chan. What are you doing?)

2016
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:42,101
There is.

2017
01:11:43,002 --> 01:11:46,138
(He tells Jong Kook about a silhouette.)

2018
01:11:46,205 --> 01:11:47,406
- The thief has double eyelids. - It's So Min.

2019
01:11:47,406 --> 01:11:48,941
It's not my eye.

2020
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,810
(Let me think.)

2021
01:11:52,578 --> 01:11:53,779
Kwang Soo.

2022
01:11:54,046 --> 01:11:55,514
(Mumbling)

2023
01:11:55,514 --> 01:11:57,616
(What's going on?)

2024
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,084
It's a woman's eye.

2025
01:11:59,084 --> 01:12:01,520
(We're shown in the eye.)

2026
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,688
It's So Min.

2027
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:05,291
(Is that really us?)

2028
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:08,627
(Se Chan makes a mistake without knowing that it was a hint.)

2029
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:10,963
- Wait a minute. What's this? - Let me see it.

2030
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,999
(Jong Kook seems to realize something.)

2031
01:12:13,999 --> 01:12:19,605
(Did Jong Kook figure it out?)

2032
01:12:19,805 --> 01:12:21,674
It's definitely So Min.

2033
01:12:21,674 --> 01:12:23,275
It's not me.

2034
01:12:23,709 --> 01:12:24,777
It's So Min.

2035
01:12:24,777 --> 01:12:26,745
I don't think it's one person.

2036
01:12:27,112 --> 01:12:28,447
(The suspect from the hints keep changing.)

2037
01:12:28,447 --> 01:12:30,783
(There are several people who acted suspiciously.)

2038
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:33,285
(Jong Kook notices something strange.)

2039
01:12:33,285 --> 01:12:35,688
(Will Jong Kook find out about all 7 thieves?)

2040
01:12:36,155 --> 01:12:39,525
Everyone, it's time to vote.

2041
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:41,393
- I'll start. - You'll vote in order.

2042
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,295
Right now?

2043
01:12:43,295 --> 01:12:46,799
(Jong Kook wins if Jong Kook votes for all 7.)

2044
01:12:46,799 --> 01:12:48,300
- Are you done? - Are you already done?

2045
01:12:48,734 --> 01:12:50,469
Are you getting ready to sleep?

2046
01:12:51,003 --> 01:12:53,539
(Let me think.)

2047
01:12:54,707 --> 01:13:00,245
(Why are there other shoes in the photo?)

2048
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:02,414
Who's next?

2049
01:13:02,414 --> 01:13:03,415
It's Se Chan.

2050
01:13:03,415 --> 01:13:08,053
(They hurry with their voting.)

2051
01:13:08,654 --> 01:13:10,456
(He stares.)

2052
01:13:10,456 --> 01:13:11,624
What do you think?

2053
01:13:11,624 --> 01:13:12,925
I'm not sure about you.

2054
01:13:12,925 --> 01:13:16,095
(He starts to count.)

2055
01:13:16,095 --> 01:13:19,798
(Wait, how many of us are there?)

2056
01:13:19,798 --> 01:13:22,968
(There are 8 members.)

2057
01:13:22,968 --> 01:13:27,006
(There are only 7 shoes in the photo.)

2058
01:13:27,006 --> 01:13:31,210
(What's this number?)

2059
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:33,078
(Nervous.)

2060
01:13:33,078 --> 01:13:35,914
(They remain silent.)

2061
01:13:37,483 --> 01:13:40,185
Why aren't you making a deduction?

2062
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:42,554
Wait.

2063
01:13:42,554 --> 01:13:43,922
How could you?

2064
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:46,458
(Wait, how could you?)

2065
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,493
Isn't the answer obvious?

2066
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:48,560
What?

2067
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,095
We should make a deduction.

2068
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:52,865
- It's obviously Seok Jin. - It could be So Min.

2069
01:13:52,865 --> 01:13:54,600
There's something strange going on here.

2070
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,068
No one is talking.

2071
01:13:56,235 --> 01:13:57,770
- What do you mean? - Seriously.

2072
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,838
This has never happened before.

2073
01:13:59,838 --> 01:14:01,140
You know why?

2074
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:03,776
When I was making a deduction,

2075
01:14:03,776 --> 01:14:05,377
I said that it's either one or all.

2076
01:14:05,744 --> 01:14:09,314
(The culprit is one or all of them.)

2077
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:14,019
(A while ago when they were in the van)

2078
01:14:14,019 --> 01:14:17,122
(Seok Jin was the most likely suspect.)

2079
01:14:17,122 --> 01:14:19,825
There's only one thing I can come up with.

2080
01:14:19,825 --> 01:14:22,628
- What? - It's either you or everybody.

2081
01:14:22,628 --> 01:14:24,363
(It's either you or everybody.)

2082
01:14:24,363 --> 01:14:25,764
It's either you or everybody.

2083
01:14:25,764 --> 01:14:28,500
(Is he human or a ghost?)

2084
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,835
It's either you or everybody.

2085
01:14:29,835 --> 01:14:33,005
Either everybody is in it or it's just you.

2086
01:14:33,005 --> 01:14:34,273
It's everybody excluding me.

2087
01:14:34,273 --> 01:14:37,910
I said it's one person or all.

2088
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:40,345
(Jong Kook is interrogating.)

2089
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:42,614
We picked out a few.

2090
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:43,982
- Who? - And...

2091
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:47,086
- Hold on. Who are you thinking? - You're mad, so I can't think.

2092
01:14:47,086 --> 01:14:48,887
- Who is it? - So Min and Seok Jin.

2093
01:14:48,887 --> 01:14:49,955
- Who is it? - So Min.

2094
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:50,989
- What? - So Min.

2095
01:14:50,989 --> 01:14:52,091
What about Seok Jin?

2096
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:55,360
I don't think it's him. If you're thinking about the foot,

2097
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,895
- you should look again. - I don't know. I'm going in.

2098
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,364
(He tries to escape reality.)

2099
01:14:59,364 --> 01:15:00,699
Why are you stuttering? What's wrong?

2100
01:15:00,699 --> 01:15:03,535
You keep... He makes you do that.

2101
01:15:03,535 --> 01:15:05,804
(He keeps on interrogating.)

2102
01:15:05,804 --> 01:15:07,606
Even if we don't do anything, you make people like that.

2103
01:15:07,606 --> 01:15:09,374
- Where are you going, Kwang Soo? - He makes you do that.

2104
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:12,444
(Where are you going, tall guy?)

2105
01:15:12,444 --> 01:15:14,012
- There's somebody in there. - I'm going to line up.

2106
01:15:14,012 --> 01:15:15,714
Come here, So Min. Come back.

2107
01:15:15,714 --> 01:15:17,382
- I'm going to line up. - Stand here.

2108
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:18,784
Why aren't you saying anything? Why aren't you figuring it out?

2109
01:15:18,784 --> 01:15:20,519
- We have an idea. - I did.

2110
01:15:20,519 --> 01:15:22,988
We already know. The eye and the elbow.

2111
01:15:22,988 --> 01:15:25,157
We usually talk about who it is.

2112
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:26,825
We usually whisper to each other.

2113
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:28,727
That's normal for us,

2114
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:30,162
but nobody is talking right now.

2115
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:32,798
Wait. This is a middle school senior with the juniors.

2116
01:15:32,798 --> 01:15:34,633
I mean...

2117
01:15:34,633 --> 01:15:36,735
- We already know who it is. - That's not it.

2118
01:15:36,735 --> 01:15:38,237
He won't let me go.

2119
01:15:38,237 --> 01:15:39,905
Isn't this so strange?

2120
01:15:39,905 --> 01:15:43,275
We're about to vote, so we should be noisy.

2121
01:15:43,275 --> 01:15:46,178
I'm the only one talking.

2122
01:15:46,178 --> 01:15:48,781
You lost your shoes. Why are you yelling at us?

2123
01:15:48,781 --> 01:15:50,649
You should have taken care of your shoes.

2124
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:52,151
What is wrong with you?

2125
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:54,553
- You yell at us for helping you. - This is driving me nuts.

2126
01:15:54,553 --> 01:15:57,923
To be honest, we don't care about your shoes getting lost.

2127
01:15:57,923 --> 01:16:00,859
I don't know. Just vote.

2128
01:16:00,893 --> 01:16:02,327
Can I go?

2129
01:16:02,394 --> 01:16:04,496
Why is it like this? Why...

2130
01:16:04,563 --> 01:16:06,098
I'm sure it's Seok Jin.

2131
01:16:06,098 --> 01:16:09,034
Gosh, he's so skeptical. Look at him.

2132
01:16:09,134 --> 01:16:12,437
I'm not skeptical. This is so strange.

2133
01:16:12,437 --> 01:16:16,408
Once he gets married, he'll come home and say,

2134
01:16:16,408 --> 01:16:17,776
"What's wrong with this house?"

2135
01:16:17,776 --> 01:16:20,245
(That's frightening.)

2136
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:22,514
"There's nothing wrong, honey."

2137
01:16:22,514 --> 01:16:24,850
- "Why, honey?" - "There's nothing wrong, honey."

2138
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:28,353
- "What is it now, Dad?" - "There's nothing wrong, honey."

2139
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:30,155
- "I'm home." - Me?

2140
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:31,423
- "Why, Dad?" - When did I do that?

2141
01:16:31,423 --> 01:16:33,625
"You don't talk about me at all."

2142
01:16:33,625 --> 01:16:35,894
("You don't talk about me at all.")

2143
01:16:35,894 --> 01:16:37,095
- "What's wrong?" - Listen.

2144
01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:38,997
- "Why aren't you welcoming me?" - Let me say this.

2145
01:16:38,997 --> 01:16:41,800
If I say that, there must be something wrong in the house.

2146
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,368
- Really? - There has to be.

2147
01:16:43,368 --> 01:16:45,204
I... Oh, gosh.

2148
01:16:45,204 --> 01:16:47,039
(That's pressuring his family.)

2149
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,276
Fine. I had a hunch in the beginning.

2150
01:16:51,276 --> 01:16:53,445
- I'll trust it. - Okay.

2151
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:55,480
(He trusts his instincts and votes.)

2152
01:16:55,714 --> 01:16:59,117
(Who will Jong Kook vote for?)

2153
01:16:59,885 --> 01:17:01,587
(Sighing)

2154
01:17:03,722 --> 01:17:06,992
(What?)

2155
01:17:06,992 --> 01:17:09,027
(He takes his cap off.)

2156
01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:13,765
(They turn in their phones and clothes so that they don't get wet.)

2157
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:17,035
(This is how they accept the penalty.)

2158
01:17:17,035 --> 01:17:19,304
How many boxers do I have to carry?

2159
01:17:19,304 --> 01:17:20,706
(He's mad.)

2160
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:22,107
I...

2161
01:17:22,374 --> 01:17:24,443
get stressed over these things.

2162
01:17:24,443 --> 01:17:27,045
(Will Jong Kook give them the penalty?)

2163
01:17:28,013 --> 01:17:32,084
(He'll trust his instincts.)

2164
01:17:32,084 --> 01:17:35,087
(Hesitating)

2165
01:17:35,087 --> 01:17:38,624
(I choose you.)

2166
01:17:38,624 --> 01:17:39,625
Okay.

2167
01:17:39,625 --> 01:17:42,160
I think it might be me and So Min.

2168
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,595
I'll prepare myself.

2169
01:17:43,595 --> 01:17:46,598
It'll hurt to get flogged when you're soaked.

2170
01:17:46,598 --> 01:17:47,766
That's true.

2171
01:17:47,766 --> 01:17:48,800
Do we get flogged?

2172
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,535
(What?)

2173
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:52,170
- Why do we get flogged? - Do we get flogged?

2174
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,539
- Why do we get flogged? - Aren't there sticks?

2175
01:17:54,673 --> 01:17:55,874
What? Why do we get flogged?

2176
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:58,911
- There were sticks. - They just carry them around.

2177
01:17:59,044 --> 01:18:00,345
Just in case?

2178
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:01,513
(Let's see.)

2179
01:18:01,513 --> 01:18:02,614
I don't know.

2180
01:18:02,614 --> 01:18:03,615
(He gives up.)

2181
01:18:03,615 --> 01:18:05,150
(Do better.)

2182
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:07,419
Just in case? Why do we get flogged?

2183
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:09,154
Did you say that because there were sticks?

2184
01:18:09,154 --> 01:18:12,324
(I don't know. I'm getting dizzy.)

2185
01:18:12,724 --> 01:18:16,662
Here are the voting results.

2186
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:18,964
(If Jong Kook votes for everybody, they'll get the water bomb penalty.)

2187
01:18:18,964 --> 01:18:21,033
If the thief gets caught,

2188
01:18:21,033 --> 01:18:23,335
he or she will get the water bomb penalty,

2189
01:18:23,335 --> 01:18:25,504
and the other members will get a prize.

2190
01:18:25,504 --> 01:18:28,707
If the thief does not get caught, the thief will get the prize,

2191
01:18:28,707 --> 01:18:32,277
and the other members will get the water bomb penalty.

2192
01:18:32,778 --> 01:18:33,845
(It's up to Detective Jong Kook.)

2193
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,080
One...

2194
01:18:37,049 --> 01:18:38,083
two...

2195
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:40,018
(What will happen to the 7 thieves?)

2196
01:18:40,085 --> 01:18:41,086
Three.

2197
01:18:41,086 --> 01:18:42,654
(Here are the results.)

2198
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:47,259
(Was Jong Kook certain that there were 7 thieves?)

2199
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:48,527
Three.

2200
01:18:48,727 --> 01:18:51,930
(Splashing)

2201
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:55,867
(He catches the 7 petty thieves.)

2202
01:18:55,867 --> 01:18:57,569
It's cold.

2203
01:18:57,569 --> 01:18:59,604
(Goodness)

2204
01:19:00,472 --> 01:19:01,707
What was that?

2205
01:19:01,707 --> 01:19:03,108
I was right.

2206
01:19:03,108 --> 01:19:05,777
(Yes, I was right.)

2207
01:19:06,178 --> 01:19:09,047
(His instinct was...)

2208
01:19:09,047 --> 01:19:13,085
(Stamping)

2209
01:19:13,085 --> 01:19:17,756
(There were 7 thieves.)

2210
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,458
I was right.

2211
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:22,227
(He rounds up the petty thieves.)

2212
01:19:22,227 --> 01:19:23,662
Stop laughing.

2213
01:19:24,696 --> 01:19:25,831
(Are you happy for winning 7 to 1?)

2214
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:27,399
This isn't fun at all!

2215
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,568
- This isn't fun. - This isn't even slightly fun.

2216
01:19:29,568 --> 01:19:30,836
I was right.

2217
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:32,471
I told you he'll get it.

2218
01:19:32,471 --> 01:19:35,273
- Yes. - Who was that for?

2219
01:19:35,273 --> 01:19:37,709
Let's do eight people next time. Join us, Chul Min.

2220
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:39,644
You should join us too.

2221
01:19:39,644 --> 01:19:42,180
I told you this wouldn't work.

2222
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:44,149
How did you know?

2223
01:19:44,216 --> 01:19:46,184
To tell you the truth,

2224
01:19:46,284 --> 01:19:47,819
I thought it was over from the beginning.

2225
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:48,954
Me too.

2226
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:50,856
I knew he'd guess.

2227
01:19:50,856 --> 01:19:53,191
He's good at deducing,

2228
01:19:53,191 --> 01:19:54,626
but we're really bad too.

2229
01:19:54,793 --> 01:19:56,395
We didn't say a word near the end.

2230
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,896
We were so intimidated.

2231
01:19:57,896 --> 01:19:59,598
Our teamwork wasn't great.

2232
01:19:59,598 --> 01:20:00,632
It was you.

2233
01:20:00,632 --> 01:20:02,534
There is an additional penalty.

2234
01:20:02,534 --> 01:20:06,371
One petty thief will get flogged by Jong Kook.

2235
01:20:06,371 --> 01:20:07,506
Let's do rack-paper-scissors.

2236
01:20:07,506 --> 01:20:09,341
- "Rack-paper-scissors". - "Rack-paper-scissors".

2237
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:12,210
(Let's do "rack-paper-scissors".)

2238
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,912
- "Rack-paper-scissors". - What's that?

2239
01:20:13,912 --> 01:20:16,515
- Where's that from? - What's that?

2240
01:20:16,615 --> 01:20:18,917
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - You can do that.

2241
01:20:18,917 --> 01:20:22,087
People who has the same gesture as Jong Kook stays behind.

2242
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:23,388
- That sounds good. - Okay.

2243
01:20:23,388 --> 01:20:24,723
I'll do it here.

2244
01:20:24,723 --> 01:20:26,124
Rock-paper-scissors

2245
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:27,125
(The last person remaining will get the penalty.)

2246
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:28,927
(Jong Kook has scissors, Ji Hyo has rock, and So Min has paper.)

2247
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:30,462
Goodness.

2248
01:20:30,962 --> 01:20:32,064
No way!

2249
01:20:32,064 --> 01:20:33,165
(Ji Hyo and So Min survive. The rest are still playing.)

2250
01:20:33,165 --> 01:20:34,366
I'm relieved.

2251
01:20:34,366 --> 01:20:35,734
- I'm relieved. - Who survived?

2252
01:20:35,734 --> 01:20:37,169
- Really? - Goodness.

2253
01:20:37,169 --> 01:20:39,237
- Why did you throw out "scissors"? - You usually do "rock".

2254
01:20:39,237 --> 01:20:40,872
We're all...

2255
01:20:41,339 --> 01:20:42,941
You usually do "rock".

2256
01:20:43,508 --> 01:20:45,110
I'm so mad.

2257
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:46,578
Why didn't you do "rock"?

2258
01:20:46,578 --> 01:20:50,082
- Ready. - Rock-paper-scissors

2259
01:20:50,115 --> 01:20:52,317
(Jong Kook has paper, and Haha has scissors.)

2260
01:20:52,317 --> 01:20:53,785
Okay!

2261
01:20:53,785 --> 01:20:55,587
(He's saved.)

2262
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:59,491
(The rest still remain.)

2263
01:20:59,858 --> 01:21:01,326
No way!

2264
01:21:01,326 --> 01:21:02,561
What are you doing?

2265
01:21:02,561 --> 01:21:04,729
Please save me.

2266
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:07,265
Please. Stop reading my mind!

2267
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:08,867
What's wrong?

2268
01:21:08,867 --> 01:21:10,735
- I'm not. - What's wrong with you?

2269
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:12,003
What's wrong?

2270
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:13,171
Let's do this.

2271
01:21:13,171 --> 01:21:14,806
- Please. - This is driving me nuts.

2272
01:21:14,806 --> 01:21:16,241
Let's decide fast.

2273
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:17,976
- We have to decide. - Please.

2274
01:21:18,143 --> 01:21:19,845
All right. I'll do it.

2275
01:21:19,845 --> 01:21:20,912
Rock-paper...

2276
01:21:20,912 --> 01:21:22,147
(Rock-paper...)

2277
01:21:22,147 --> 01:21:23,348
- Rock-paper-scissors - Scissors

2278
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:26,318
(Se Chan has paper, and the rest have scissors.)

2279
01:21:26,318 --> 01:21:28,653
(What about Jong Kook?)

2280
01:21:28,653 --> 01:21:32,724
(He chooses paper.)

2281
01:21:32,724 --> 01:21:34,226
Yes!

2282
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:35,393
(Goodness)

2283
01:21:35,393 --> 01:21:38,663
(Congratulations, Se Chan.)

2284
01:21:41,032 --> 01:21:44,402
(Surprisingly, they survive.)

2285
01:21:44,402 --> 01:21:46,404
How did this happen? Us three.

2286
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:48,640
(Let's start the penalty with Jong Kook.)

2287
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,308
You're his favorite pupil.

2288
01:21:50,842 --> 01:21:52,611
(Sighing)

2289
01:21:53,778 --> 01:21:55,013
It's going to be so painful.

2290
01:21:55,013 --> 01:21:57,149
You're really bad too.

2291
01:21:57,149 --> 01:21:59,217
(He thought about it.)

2292
01:21:59,217 --> 01:22:00,252
In what aspects?

2293
01:22:00,252 --> 01:22:02,287
I take care of you.

2294
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:05,223
Se Chan has to get hit and get his act together.

2295
01:22:05,223 --> 01:22:08,193
- I agree. - What did I do?

2296
01:22:08,193 --> 01:22:09,995
It's like this.

2297
01:22:09,995 --> 01:22:11,730
This, right?

2298
01:22:12,097 --> 01:22:13,098
Here?

2299
01:22:13,098 --> 01:22:14,399
- That hurts. - Here?

2300
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:16,101
(That hurts.)

2301
01:22:16,101 --> 01:22:18,136
- Hold on. - Did it hurt?

2302
01:22:18,136 --> 01:22:19,404
- Did it hurt? - Yes.

2303
01:22:19,404 --> 01:22:22,007
I can't watch.

2304
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:23,475
I can't watch.

2305
01:22:23,475 --> 01:22:25,710
I can't make a mistake,

2306
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:26,912
so I have to aim here.

2307
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:28,680
I'm going to do this.

2308
01:22:29,214 --> 01:22:32,117
(Hitting)

2309
01:22:32,117 --> 01:22:35,654
(He did it.)

2310
01:22:35,654 --> 01:22:37,255
(Beautiful form)

2311
01:22:37,255 --> 01:22:39,691
(Nice shot)

2312
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:42,661
(That sounds like firewood being chopped.)

2313
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:44,462
(Hitting)

2314
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:47,098
(It makes him go after Jong Kook.)

2315
01:22:47,098 --> 01:22:48,466
- That looks painful. - It does.

2316
01:22:49,201 --> 01:22:52,304
Why? Did it hurt?

2317
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:53,371
(This is a lovely bromance.)

2318
01:22:53,371 --> 01:22:54,639
Did you think it wouldn't?

2319
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:55,740
(Do you think it was sweet?)

2320
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:58,343
Jong Kook is the winner.

2321
01:22:58,577 --> 01:23:00,178
Congratulations.

2322
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:02,480
(The race ended earlier than expected.)

2323
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:03,682
(A week later)

2324
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:06,351
Hello.

2325
01:23:06,351 --> 01:23:08,119
Why do you keep winning the polls?

2326
01:23:08,119 --> 01:23:09,254
- What? - Why?

2327
01:23:09,254 --> 01:23:10,388
You win everything.

2328
01:23:10,388 --> 01:23:12,591
"The star who will do fine without laws."

2329
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:14,893
(What's the law?)

2330
01:23:14,893 --> 01:23:16,494
Why did he get first place?

2331
01:23:16,494 --> 01:23:17,829
You are first place too.

2332
01:23:17,829 --> 01:23:19,064
- For what? - What?

2333
01:23:19,064 --> 01:23:21,066
You upload things the fastest.

2334
01:23:21,066 --> 01:23:23,268
(You upload on social media the fastest.)

2335
01:23:23,268 --> 01:23:25,337
Do you mean the picture I took with Tom?

2336
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:27,172
Why did you upload the picture...

2337
01:23:27,172 --> 01:23:29,040
you took with Tom Cruise?

2338
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:31,710
Isn't that why we took the pictures? Why didn't you upload it?

2339
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:33,712
- Tom Cruise is going to sue you. - Why?

2340
01:23:33,712 --> 01:23:34,980
(Be careful.)

2341
01:23:35,513 --> 01:23:37,415
- Did he say that? - Yes.

2342
01:23:37,415 --> 01:23:39,651
Tom is mad,

2343
01:23:39,651 --> 01:23:42,520
because you're not good friends, but you posted the picture...

2344
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,089
without his permission.

2345
01:23:44,089 --> 01:23:45,290
He said this on his way out.

2346
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:46,992
"Please keep it to yourself."

2347
01:23:46,992 --> 01:23:49,027
(Please keep it to yourself.)

2348
01:23:49,027 --> 01:23:50,428
- "Keep it to yourself." - You heard him, right?

2349
01:23:50,428 --> 01:23:51,529
- You heard him. - "Keep it to yourself."

2350
01:23:51,529 --> 01:23:53,064
- "Keep it to yourself." - "Keep it to yourself."

2351
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:55,433
- You heard him, right? - "Keep it to yourself."

2352
01:23:55,433 --> 01:23:57,168
How did he say that?

2353
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:58,737
- He knows everything. - That's not possible.

2354
01:23:58,737 --> 01:24:01,239
- He's been to Korea nine times. - Right.

2355
01:24:01,239 --> 01:24:02,707
- Do you think he can't say that? - That's right.

2356
01:24:02,741 --> 01:24:04,809
He said, "Please keep it to yourself."

2357
01:24:04,809 --> 01:24:06,278
He said this to me.

2358
01:24:06,745 --> 01:24:10,081
(What did Tom Cruise say to you?)

2359
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:11,082
He said this to me.

2360
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:13,451
"Please post it."

2361
01:24:13,451 --> 01:24:15,420
- Seok Jin. - What's wrong with you?

2362
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:16,721
(Gosh, Seok Jin.)

2363
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,423
(Their smiles are gone.)

2364
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:19,891
What was that?

2365
01:24:20,258 --> 01:24:21,993
Come on, Seok Jin.

2366
01:24:21,993 --> 01:24:23,762
- Come on, Seok Jin. - "Upload it"?

2367
01:24:23,762 --> 01:24:26,264
- See? No one is laughing. - Exactly.

2368
01:24:26,264 --> 01:24:28,466
(See? No one is laughing.)

2369
01:24:28,867 --> 01:24:31,136
(Doctor Yu brought it back to life.)

2370
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,471
I wasn't trying to make you laugh.

2371
01:24:33,471 --> 01:24:36,608
People laugh when they can relate.

2372
01:24:36,608 --> 01:24:39,878
I'll see how long you'll survive. I'll be watching you.

2373
01:24:40,412 --> 01:24:43,882
As of today, our show has been running for eight years now.

2374
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:46,551
And the eight of you will join today's race,

2375
01:24:46,551 --> 01:24:48,887
- Get Your Number Eights. - What?

2376
01:24:48,887 --> 01:24:50,121
My fortune?

2377
01:24:50,588 --> 01:24:51,756
(Do you mean, "my fortune"?)

2378
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:53,992
- My fortune? - It's a pun with the number eight.

2379
01:24:54,759 --> 01:24:56,861
Through your given missions,

2380
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:59,397
you must acquire the number eight.

2381
01:24:59,397 --> 01:25:01,800
3 members that acquire 8 of the particular number 1st...

2382
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,869
- will advance to the final round. - Only three members?

2383
01:25:04,869 --> 01:25:08,139
And only 1 of the 3 members will become the ultimate winner.

2384
01:25:08,139 --> 01:25:10,975
The final winner will be given an incredible privilege.

2385
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:12,410
What's the privilege?

2386
01:25:12,777 --> 01:25:13,878
(What is the privilege?)

2387
01:25:13,878 --> 01:25:18,083
The privilege is that the winner can change...

2388
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:21,753
the name and the profile photo of Running Man's members...

2389
01:25:21,853 --> 01:25:24,556
on the biggest search engine in Korea for eight days.

2390
01:25:24,556 --> 01:25:26,524
(The winner gets complete control for 8 days.)

2391
01:25:26,524 --> 01:25:29,060
(The privilege to change their profiles is amazing.)

2392
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:30,261
- What? - For seven days?

2393
01:25:30,261 --> 01:25:33,531
For example, for Seok Jin's profile, I can put a photo of his nose.

2394
01:25:33,598 --> 01:25:36,634
I can just update his nickname on it. Is that really possible?

2395
01:25:36,634 --> 01:25:40,071
Yes, as long as they aren't curse words or distasteful photos.

2396
01:25:40,071 --> 01:25:42,640
- So I can't use curse words? - Of course not.

2397
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:43,975
(Darn it.)

2398
01:25:43,975 --> 01:25:46,444
(I had a good one in mind. What a shame.)

2399
01:25:46,444 --> 01:25:48,713
- Do you think that's allowed? - All right.

2400
01:25:48,713 --> 01:25:51,416
- He hasn't learned his lesson. - I was confirming what he said.

2401
01:25:51,716 --> 01:25:52,717
I'm sorry.

2402
01:25:52,717 --> 01:25:54,686
(Bowing down)

2403
01:25:54,686 --> 01:25:57,021
- Get a grip, Kwang Soo. Focus. - Be careful.

2404
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:58,356
- Be careful. Stay focused. - I'm sorry.

2405
01:25:58,356 --> 01:26:01,126
Before we start the race,

2406
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:04,629
you'll come up with the drafts how you want to change...

2407
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:05,897
the members' profiles.

2408
01:26:05,897 --> 01:26:08,266
- To tell you the truth, I can... - Okay.

2409
01:26:08,266 --> 01:26:11,236
- just use the existing photos. - You'll change the name?

2410
01:26:11,236 --> 01:26:14,272
- The names will be important. - That's right. Exactly.

2411
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:18,710
For Seok Jin, I'll change his name to "Earthworm".

2412
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,811
(Because it rhymes with his last name?)

2413
01:26:19,811 --> 01:26:20,812
That's so childish.

2414
01:26:20,812 --> 01:26:23,181
Then if people look me up, there will be an earthworm?

2415
01:26:23,615 --> 01:26:24,783
- Earthworm. - Earthworm.

2416
01:26:24,783 --> 01:26:27,051
I'm going to go with chicken breast for Jong Kook.

2417
01:26:27,852 --> 01:26:30,054
- Chicken breast for Jong Kook. - That's good.

2418
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:31,456
- Chicken breast. - Hey, we're like...

2419
01:26:31,456 --> 01:26:33,958
- kids coming up with nicknames. - Right.

2420
01:26:33,958 --> 01:26:35,693
I'll go with Small-minded for Jong Kook.

2421
01:26:36,361 --> 01:26:38,863
- "Small-minded". - He sounds like a kid.

2422
01:26:38,863 --> 01:26:41,299
- Small-minded. - What should I name Haha?

2423
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:44,669
- Haha? - How about Status Laundering?

2424
01:26:44,669 --> 01:26:45,670
(Status Laundering?)

2425
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:49,107
- Status Laundering? - He totally laundered his past.

2426
01:26:49,674 --> 01:26:51,476
(Laughing)

2427
01:26:51,476 --> 01:26:53,578
- "Status Laundering"? - Okay. For Jong Kook,

2428
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:56,147
I'm going to go with Yoon Eun Hye.

2429
01:26:56,815 --> 01:26:58,583
(Yoon Eun Hye, "A Man")

2430
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,185
(The drafts for the profiles turn into bickering matches.)

2431
01:27:00,185 --> 01:27:02,020
Gosh, isn't that too much?

2432
01:27:02,353 --> 01:27:05,757
For Jong Kook, I'll go with "He Bites When Petted".

2433
01:27:05,757 --> 01:27:07,459
(Watch out for Jong Kook, the dog.)

2434
01:27:07,459 --> 01:27:08,960
Hey, that's mine.

2435
01:27:09,494 --> 01:27:10,895
"He Bites When Petted".

2436
01:27:10,895 --> 01:27:13,364
I'm going to use that for him. "Beware: Stay Away".

2437
01:27:13,364 --> 01:27:14,566
(She'll add this too.)

2438
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:16,568
- Kwang Soo. - Gosh, Kwang Soo.

2439
01:27:16,568 --> 01:27:19,237
- Frog. - It's hard to pick one for him.

2440
01:27:19,237 --> 01:27:22,040
If you give me a good one, I'll return the favor.

2441
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:24,509
- If it's decent... - Then I would like to...

2442
01:27:24,509 --> 01:27:26,511
- have a deal. - Is there a nickname you want?

2443
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:28,379
- Do you want something like Prince? - Prince?

2444
01:27:28,379 --> 01:27:30,615
- No, I'll be embarrassed. - Actually, it sounds sarcastic.

2445
01:27:30,615 --> 01:27:33,318
- That's more insulting. - Why?

2446
01:27:33,551 --> 01:27:36,454
I got it. I'm going to name Kwang Soo as Fish.

2447
01:27:36,454 --> 01:27:38,690
(Out of all names, he'll go with Fish?)

2448
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:40,959
- Fish. - Fish?

2449
01:27:40,959 --> 01:27:42,760
- You do look like a fish too. - Right.

2450
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,196
- Rockfish. - What... Rockfish?

2451
01:27:45,964 --> 01:27:47,332
- Fish. - Rockfish.

2452
01:27:47,332 --> 01:27:50,168
- People look up fish a lot now. - Right.

2453
01:27:50,168 --> 01:27:53,037
Kwang Soo can be one of them. I'm making you famous.

2454
01:27:53,037 --> 01:27:54,772
(He's talking nonsense.)

2455
01:27:54,772 --> 01:28:02,413
- It'll raise your status, you know. - That's right.

2456
01:28:02,413 --> 01:28:04,482
I'll get more points with the photo of a fish?

2457
01:28:04,983 --> 01:28:07,452
- Or Song Joong Ki's Friend. - Oh, right.

2458
01:28:07,452 --> 01:28:08,653
(Or I'll go with Song Joong Ki's Friend.)

2459
01:28:08,653 --> 01:28:11,589
- Oh, right. That's a good one. - Song Joong Ki's Friend.

2460
01:28:11,589 --> 01:28:13,224
- That's great. - I'm really going to do this then.

2461
01:28:13,224 --> 01:28:15,627
Or I'll go with Freeze, Song Joong Ki.

2462
01:28:15,894 --> 01:28:17,629
Why would you say that?

2463
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:19,531
(I hate that even more! What is that?)

2464
01:28:19,531 --> 01:28:21,432
- Freeze, Song Joong Ki? - Why not?

2465
01:28:21,432 --> 01:28:23,968
- Freeze, Song Joong Ki. - Why would I tell him to freeze?

2466
01:28:23,968 --> 01:28:26,471
You'll catch up with him soon, so "Freeze, Song Joong Ki".

2467
01:28:26,471 --> 01:28:28,273
We'll use the photo with the gun.

2468
01:28:29,107 --> 01:28:30,408
I'll name So Min Farter.

2469
01:28:30,408 --> 01:28:31,676
- Don't do that. - It's cute.

2470
01:28:31,676 --> 01:28:33,778
That's good. That's a cute one.

2471
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:36,814
- No, I don't fart. - That's a cute one.

2472
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:38,583
I don't fart.

2473
01:28:38,583 --> 01:28:40,518
- I don't. - Lady Kwang Soo is good too.

2474
01:28:40,552 --> 01:28:43,588
- No, no. Jae Seok, please. Don't. - Or what about Pooping So Min?

2475
01:28:43,588 --> 01:28:46,658
No, that's... I'll take Pooping So Min over Lady Kwang Soo.

2476
01:28:46,658 --> 01:28:48,259
(Gosh, whatever.)

2477
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,461
- Pooping So Min. - Or I'll take Farting Bug.

2478
01:28:50,461 --> 01:28:52,864
Hey, Farting Bug is better than Lady Kwang Soo?

2479
01:28:52,864 --> 01:28:55,533
Farting Bug is better than Lady Kwang Soo.

2480
01:28:55,633 --> 01:28:57,869
- Unbelievable. - That's a better choice.

2481
01:28:57,869 --> 01:28:59,604
I'll rather go with Farting Bug.

2482
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:01,272
What did you put down for Jae Seok?

2483
01:29:01,272 --> 01:29:03,775
- I put down Ugly Man for Jae Seok. - Jae Seok...

2484
01:29:03,775 --> 01:29:05,543
(He didn't mean that literally, right?)

2485
01:29:05,543 --> 01:29:07,645
- I gave him a good one. - Hey.

2486
01:29:07,645 --> 01:29:10,548
- Are you serious? - I mean, it could mean...

2487
01:29:10,815 --> 01:29:12,483
- I mean... - Goodness.

2488
01:29:12,483 --> 01:29:14,719
I put down Small Jae Seok for Jae Seok's name.

2489
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:16,254
Hey, what are you doing?

2490
01:29:16,254 --> 01:29:17,655
(Small Jae Seok)

2491
01:29:17,655 --> 01:29:18,957
(What did you say?)

2492
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:21,159
- Yours is similar to mine. - What's yours?

2493
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:22,794
What do you mean by Small Jae Seok?

2494
01:29:22,794 --> 01:29:25,129
- Hey, I saw it. I did! - Listen.

2495
01:29:25,129 --> 01:29:27,165
- Have you gone mad? - "Small Jae Seok".

2496
01:29:27,165 --> 01:29:29,767
I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Small Jae Seok.

2497
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:32,136
- You can't let people do that. - He's small?

2498
01:29:32,136 --> 01:29:35,907
For Jae Seok, I'll just put a period.

2499
01:29:35,907 --> 01:29:36,908
(He's as small as a period.)

2500
01:29:36,908 --> 01:29:38,343
Hey, you stay out of this.

2501
01:29:38,343 --> 01:29:40,278
- He's small. - They're unbelievable.

2502
01:29:40,278 --> 01:29:42,280
I can't believe you wrote, "Small Jae Seok".

2503
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,782
- That's neat. - I see. Is that how you'll play it?

2504
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:46,050
(How will the race end?)

2505
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,952
(The race to acquire the number 8 begins at last.)

2506
01:29:48,086 --> 01:29:50,622
(Special backups have been dispatched for the war.)

2507
01:29:50,622 --> 01:29:52,423
(Sung Dong Il, a sure bet to make movies hits)

2508
01:29:53,324 --> 01:29:55,360
(Shin Hae Sun, the queen of TV ratings)

2509
01:29:55,426 --> 01:29:56,628
Gosh, it's Mamamoo.

2510
01:29:56,628 --> 01:29:57,996
(Jang Do Yeon and Mamamoo)

2511
01:29:58,396 --> 01:29:59,797
(Are you sure this is Running Man?)

2512
01:29:59,797 --> 01:30:00,965
(With these special guests,)

2513
01:30:00,965 --> 01:30:02,066
(they will eat,)

2514
01:30:02,066 --> 01:30:03,334
(show slapstick comedies,)

2515
01:30:03,334 --> 01:30:05,236
(and throw the ultimate party of variety shows.)

2516
01:30:05,737 --> 01:30:06,871
(If you cheat,)

2517
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:07,972
(you'll get a beating.)

2518
01:30:07,972 --> 01:30:09,540
(You deserve a beating.)

2519
01:30:10,475 --> 01:30:12,377
(And the final mission where the number 8 is at stake)

2520
01:30:12,577 --> 01:30:14,979
(An octagon ring unfolds before their eyes.)

2521
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:16,681
(They betray and plot to win the numbers.)

2522
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:18,483
(Can they change their fortunes to good ones...)

2523
01:30:18,483 --> 01:30:20,485
(or ruin them?)

2524
01:30:20,585 --> 01:30:21,953
(It's their last chance to change their fortunes.)

2525
01:30:21,953 --> 01:30:23,721
(What will happen to these eight members?)

2526
01:30:24,022 --> 01:30:26,057
(Protect Your Names)
