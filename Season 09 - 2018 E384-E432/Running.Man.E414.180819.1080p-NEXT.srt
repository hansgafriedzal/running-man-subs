1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,492
(The sun shines brightly at 9am.)

2
00:00:08,572 --> 00:00:11,371
What are we doing today?

3
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:14,339
Do I have a secret mission?

4
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:15,581
(The production crew separately meets each member.)

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,722
Is there something I must do separately?

6
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:17,733
(The production crew separately meets each member.)

7
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:21,122
You will soon get a message from the headquarters.

8
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:23,022
- Will I get a message? - Yes.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,841
It will be sent to your phone.

10
00:00:25,622 --> 00:00:26,673
I received it.

11
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:30,301
(The 8 members receive a mysterious message.)

12
00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:33,902
"Congratulations. You acquired 100 dollars in Running Money..."

13
00:00:33,903 --> 00:00:37,174
"For today's race." Are we receiving money?

14
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:40,742
"Select a member who will receive 50 out of the said 100 dollars."

15
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:43,469
"With whom you shared the money won't be revealed."

16
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:46,682
(Do I need to give half of my Running Money?)

17
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:47,764
To whom should I give my money?

18
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:51,282
Do I have to share it? Is it a must?

19
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,352
Is it a rule?

20
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,521
(You must give 50 dollars to someone.)

21
00:00:53,522 --> 00:00:55,521
That's half.

22
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,561
(You must give 50 dollars to someone.)

23
00:00:56,562 --> 00:01:01,231
To whom do I want to give half of the money?

24
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:02,902
(Having more money puts you at an advantage.)

25
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:04,932
It will be a dogfight.

26
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:07,255
(Let's see who receives the most amount of money.)

27
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,902
When you have this kind of a mission,

28
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,641
there is someone you must call.

29
00:01:12,642 --> 00:01:13,841
(The psychological warfare begins as they move to the first location.)

30
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,469
I am sure he is busy.

31
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:21,281
(Who is busy thinking from the start?)

32
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:23,721
- Haha, I just wrote your name. - Hey.

33
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:25,921
(He says this as soon as he picks up.)

34
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:27,621
- What? - It's not like that.

35
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:29,621
I waited for your call.

36
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,663
I just got in the van.

37
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:34,450
I did, too.

38
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:36,832
I thought about you...

39
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,731
as soon as I saw this.

40
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,402
I already sent the money to you.

41
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,159
I am serious. Haha.

42
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,001
Are you telling me the truth?

43
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:47,341
Yes. If you don't trust me, it can't be helped.

44
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,262
If this is a lie,

45
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,582
I will post something on SNS when the shoot ends.

46
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,751
You remember the celebrity you used to date, right?

47
00:01:55,752 --> 00:01:57,052
(Do you want a big revelation?)

48
00:01:57,053 --> 00:01:58,366
I am sick and tired of this.

49
00:01:59,823 --> 00:02:01,540
- I am serious. - Why did I pick up?

50
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,283
I knew there was a reason why I didn't want to pick up.

51
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:06,992
If this is a lie, I will feel betrayed.

52
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,432
- Haha. - Yes?

53
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,453
Don't make that threat from now on.

54
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,231
(I can't do anything.)

55
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,617
I can't do anything.

56
00:02:14,132 --> 00:02:17,203
I can't do anything since I know you will really do it.

57
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:20,100
- To be honest, I haven't sent it. - You haven't, right?

58
00:02:20,143 --> 00:02:22,294
- Let's be honest to each other. - I am sorry.

59
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:26,052
Kwang Soo, I will send you the money.

60
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:28,351
(Kwang Soo, I will send you the money.)

61
00:02:28,352 --> 00:02:31,881
Send me 50 dollars. That way, we will have the original amount.

62
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:35,022
Okay. I will send you the money right away.

63
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,392
- I am almost there. - Okay.

64
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,992
I won't call anyone else.

65
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,291
- Okay, Haha. - Okay. I love you.

66
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:42,932
I love you. I won't call anyone else.

67
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:43,943
Okay.

68
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:46,432
(They hang up.)

69
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,001
He is a jerk.

70
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,742
- Hello. - Kwang Soo.

71
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:51,841
- Jae Seok. - You were talking on the phone.

72
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,428
Yes, I was.

73
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:55,329
I got a call from Haha.

74
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:57,226
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

75
00:02:58,013 --> 00:03:00,710
You know what I am going to say, right?

76
00:03:00,852 --> 00:03:03,479
I don't know what to do. I will send you the money.

77
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,552
I am serious. I will send it right away.

78
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,916
Forget it. You are irredeemable.

79
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,621
I will send you the money. I will.

80
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,762
Think about it. We don't know what kind of a game we will play,

81
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:15,832
but it will be a disaster if we give money to one person...

82
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,358
and let them be on a power trip.

83
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,531
- Jae Seok. - Who shouldn't it be?

84
00:03:20,532 --> 00:03:22,841
- It can't be Jong Kook. - I understand.

85
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:25,172
- Let's exclude Jong Kook. - Let's exclude Jong Kook.

86
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:26,571
- I will do that. - Okay.

87
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,911
- All right, Jae Seok. - Okay.

88
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,941
(Everyone wants to keep Jong Kook in check.)

89
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:35,251
As a star, I will hold an event...

90
00:03:35,252 --> 00:03:38,687
for my fan.

91
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,621
Hello, Jong Kook. It's me, Se Chan.

92
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,422
My lovely Se Chan.

93
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,121
I am your number one celebrity fan, Yang Se Chan.

94
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,732
- That's right. - Yes.

95
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,176
There will be an event from the star.

96
00:03:51,263 --> 00:03:54,302
Jong Kook, your number one celebrity fan...

97
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,161
will send a present today.

98
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:57,902
I will send 500 dollars.

99
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,094
I don't know if I should accept it.

100
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,272
Please accept it.

101
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:05,952
I prefer pampering my fans.

102
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,182
- I knew it. - I prefer pampering my fans.

103
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:10,879
I will believe in the celebrity I like.

104
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,110
- Okay. - Okay.

105
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,969
I awaited your call.

106
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,782
I heard you talked to Kwang Soo on the phone.

107
00:04:18,662 --> 00:04:21,332
He told you, didn't he? When you have a mission like this,

108
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:23,727
it's customary to give everyone a call.

109
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:26,431
You weren't going to give Kwang Soo the money, were you?

110
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,632
- Never. - I knew it.

111
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:32,005
Jae Seok, you will always be the number one...

112
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:33,826
in my heart.

113
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,312
Since both of us lost our jobs on Saturday,

114
00:04:36,313 --> 00:04:38,142
we should help each other.

115
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,911
We should help each other.

116
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,351
Jae Seok, I love you infinitely.

117
00:04:42,352 --> 00:04:46,292
- Let's keep this short. - Let's not make this childish.

118
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:48,322
- I will give you 50 dollars. - Okay, Jae Seok.

119
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:50,022
- Okay. - Thank you, Jae Seok.

120
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,791
- Okay. I am hanging up. - I love you.

121
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,985
Okay. Infinite...

122
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,756
- Challenge! - I love you.

123
00:04:56,932 --> 00:04:57,931
Bye.

124
00:04:57,932 --> 00:05:01,431
(It's a magical cheer that opens the door to one's heart.)

125
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:03,291
Gosh, that opened the door to my heart.

126
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:04,753
To whom should I give the money?

127
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,312
- Jae Seok. - Ji Hyo.

128
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,181
- Yes? - I chose you.

129
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:13,012
- Me? - Yes.

130
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,281
As soon as I received the mission, I thought you should get the money.

131
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,622
You received a lot of calls.

132
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:22,229
That's not true. Ji Hyo, I received...

133
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,392
one call. However,

134
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:26,661
I said, "I can't give you 50 dollars."

135
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:29,902
Then I called you after thinking.

136
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:32,361
You are giving me a change of heart.

137
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:34,531
I mean my words. Ji Hyo,

138
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:37,471
- you are my pick. - You warm up my heart.

139
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:38,671
- Okay. - I mean my words.

140
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,111
You warm my heart.

141
00:05:40,112 --> 00:05:43,142
I am giving you half of my fortune. Think about that.

142
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,382
- Okay, Ji Hyo. - I will call you Half Ji Hyo...

143
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:47,952
because you will have half of my fortune.

144
00:05:47,953 --> 00:05:49,942
I will call you Half Ji Hyo, okay?

145
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,322
- Okay, Ji Hyo? - Okay.

146
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:53,522
- Okay. - Okay, Half Ji Hyo. 50 dollars.

147
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,351
- I will send you the money. - I will send you the money.

148
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:57,180
- Okay, I will send you the money. - Okay.

149
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,462
- Okay. - Okay.

150
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,462
(It looks like Jae Seok's words moved her.)

151
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,988
Jae Seok called me Half Ji Hyo.

152
00:06:02,802 --> 00:06:04,924
That warmed up my heart.

153
00:06:06,172 --> 00:06:07,931
I am close to tears.

154
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,442
(Let's see what kind of a decision Ji Hyo makes.)

155
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:12,741
I don't know whom to pick. There is no one.

156
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:14,228
(Seok Jin is torn because there is no one.)

157
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:17,639
Shall I call Haha? Or Kwang Soo?

158
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,181
The number you have dialed is temporarily suspended...

159
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:25,652
(What?)

160
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:26,864
What is going on?

161
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,791
The number you have dialed is temporarily suspended.

162
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,509
What happened to Kwang Soo's number?

163
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:34,531
What? That startled me.

164
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:36,178
(Why can't I call him?)

165
00:06:36,463 --> 00:06:39,632
The number you have dialed is temporarily suspended...

166
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,229
at the customer's request.

167
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,101
Did he just... Did he just block my number?

168
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:46,627
(He can't believe this.)

169
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,582
Kwang Soo isn't answering.

170
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,942
(He's the most sought-after member during mind games.)

171
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,181
Did he already cut a deal with someone?

172
00:06:52,182 --> 00:06:54,181
Even if he did, he would still answer his phone.

173
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:55,212
- Hey. - Kwang Soo.

174
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:56,637
- Yes? - Give me the money.

175
00:06:56,982 --> 00:06:59,446
I'll choose So Min.

176
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,252
(Two reckless members make contact.)

177
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:03,414
- I just chose you. - Kwang Soo, give me the money.

178
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:04,705
Will you give me yours then?

179
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:05,834
Of course.

180
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,562
Don't you think your answer isn't that believable?

181
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,824
I'll decide now. I'll give my money to Kwang Soo.

182
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:15,535
I'll give mine to So Min who lives in Jeonju.

183
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,498
- I'll give the whole thing. - I'll give mine to Kwang Soo.

184
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:22,442
Okay, then. We'll understand that So Min will give hers to Kwang Soo.

185
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,582
- Hear that? I made my decision. - Hey, hey.

186
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,512
Who is that? Who's that woman? Put her on the phone.

187
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,199
Why? It's Hyo Im.

188
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,351
Everyone is in this together.

189
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:31,382
(The staff is part of it too.)

190
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,221
Listen. I thought you'd try to deceive me.

191
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:36,615
I'm so disappointed to hear her play along.

192
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,022
(He won't fall for it.)

193
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,205
- You know? - My goodness.

194
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:42,289
Then let's each take a screenshot and exchange it.

195
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,824
- I'll really give it to you then. - Let's exchange screenshots.

196
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,431
Okay, I got it.

197
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:47,816
- You got that? - Okay.

198
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,772
I'm serious. I'll trust you and hang up now.

199
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:52,142
- Okay, I'm serious. Okay, okay. - I won't call other people then.

200
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:54,772
I'll give you the money. I'm going to send it now.

201
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,055
- Sure, sure. - Okay.

202
00:07:58,383 --> 00:08:00,029
Is there a way I can forge the text?

203
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,082
(She concocts a strategy to betray.)

204
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:03,940
I can delete this. This is awesome. Okay.

205
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:06,622
(She creates a fake headquarters number and sends a fake text.)

206
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:07,704
Delete it.

207
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:10,122
(I choose Lee Kwang Soo.)

208
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,274
There it is.

209
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:13,161
I made it.

210
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:14,274
(This is amazing.)

211
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:15,632
Isn't this incredible?

212
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,062
(Doesn't it look real?)

213
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:21,416
(I choose Lee Kwang Soo.)

214
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:22,431
Isn't this amazing?

215
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,918
- You're amazing. - I made this.

216
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,841
He probably already chose someone.

217
00:08:26,842 --> 00:08:29,911
Gosh, I should've made this earlier. I was too late.

218
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,882
- Did you see my text? - Hey.

219
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:33,327
I took a screenshot and sent it to you. Take a look.

220
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:35,399
- Okay, okay. - You saw it, right?

221
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,981
Okay. I'll send you mine.

222
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,639
- I sent it to you too. - Send me your screenshot.

223
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:40,152
- I'll send you the screenshot now. - Okay.

224
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:42,890
- I definitely sent you mine. - Okay.

225
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,122
(Did Kwang Soo really fall for it?)

226
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:46,406
I got a text from Kwang Soo.

227
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:50,340
I should check. I must check if it's real or not.

228
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:51,743
Hey.

229
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,543
This must be real.

230
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:57,041
It's hard to forge the "untitled" on top.

231
00:08:57,042 --> 00:08:58,472
(Untitled: Congratulations. You have received 100 dollars.)

232
00:08:58,473 --> 00:09:01,642
(Did Kwang Soo really send So Min 50 dollars?)

233
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:05,653
(5 minutes ago right after the call with So Min)

234
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:08,551
- You have your phone, right? - Yes.

235
00:09:08,552 --> 00:09:09,562
Let me see it.

236
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:14,032
(Kwang Soo wouldn't be that naive. He faked his text too.)

237
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,321
I just sent you the text. Send it to me right now.

238
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,151
(He faked an "untitled" message that So Min didn't think about.)

239
00:09:19,532 --> 00:09:20,992
- I got it. It worked. - I sent it.

240
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:25,072
(It's the great betrayer's class. He's one step ahead of So Min.)

241
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,251
(So Min is such a fool.)

242
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,272
This must be real.

243
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,515
(The screenshot looks authentic.)

244
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:33,071
He must've really sent the money.

245
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,183
(She falls for her own trick.)

246
00:09:34,613 --> 00:09:36,401
It'd be great if I had this for everyone.

247
00:09:36,513 --> 00:09:38,805
For each member. I'll have one for Jae Seok and Haha.

248
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,311
(She targets Haha and Jae Seok with the same method.)

249
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:43,242
That's right. I can just change the name.

250
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,051
This is great. Okay.

251
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,840
(She sends a fake screenshot.)

252
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:48,907
Gosh.

253
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,581
You know fake news can be dangerous these days, right?

254
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:54,879
I received fake news just now.

255
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,184
It's a fake tabloid. This is what I got.

256
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,132
(It's So Min's fake text message that isn't believable at all.)

257
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,950
(Jeon So Min)

258
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:02,941
The world is a scary place.

259
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:03,972
(How dare she try to pull a fast one on me?)

260
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,372
(He responds to her cute text with another cute text.)

261
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:08,039
Goodness. Then I should send this to her.

262
00:10:08,572 --> 00:10:10,159
"My gosh."

263
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,778
"My gosh, I'm so touched." Just like this.

264
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,671
(How dare you try to fool me?)

265
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,781
I just received a text message from Haha. He likes it.

266
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:20,721
He sent me a lot of thumbs-ups and said he's touched.

267
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,992
So Min did this...

268
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,191
(This fool is the only one that fell for her trickery.)

269
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,637
She sent me the screenshot.

270
00:10:25,723 --> 00:10:27,262
(So Min sent me 50 dollars?)

271
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:28,632
So Min just sent me...

272
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:30,161
(What a good friend she is.)

273
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,323
(I choose Yu Jae Seok.)

274
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:34,489
I'll give So Min 50 dollars.

275
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:37,242
(So Min puts one over on Jae Seok.)

276
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:38,454
I choose So Min.

277
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:42,340
(Everyone finishes transferring 50 dollars to someone.)

278
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:45,208
I got it. I got the text message.

279
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:47,677
"You're on good terms with others as expected."

280
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,382
"You're a good neighbor."

281
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,581
(Check who sent you half of their money.)

282
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:53,051
(Should I check how much I got?)

283
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,222
(Neighbor Website)

284
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:56,921
(If no one gave them money, they'd have only 50 dollars.)

285
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,004
Darn it.

286
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:00,132
It says I only have 50 dollars now.

287
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,789
(Darn it. It says I only have 50 dollars now.)

288
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:06,102
(None of them chose Jae Seok.)

289
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:09,201
(He made all that fuss but to no avail.)

290
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,920
Gosh, this is making me mad.

291
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:15,375
Kwang Soo and So Min. Gosh, those brats.

292
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:18,242
Gosh, I can't believe this.

293
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,352
(Add 1 more person to the list.)

294
00:11:19,353 --> 00:11:20,811
None of the members gave me any.

295
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,025
(He wasn't chosen just like Jae Seok.)

296
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,901
I can't understand this.

297
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,897
Who else could they give the money if not to me?

298
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:27,063
(Think about all the fuss I made.)

299
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,764
I have 150 dollars.

300
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:30,405
- Okay. - Who sent him the money?

301
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:33,993
- It says I have 150 dollars. - Okay.

302
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,291
150 dollars?

303
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:37,762
If it's 150 dollars, that means 2 people sent me money.

304
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,176
(Ji Hyo and Haha chose Jong Kook.)

305
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,431
It says I have 150 dollars.

306
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:43,502
(Ji Hyo also has 150 dollars.)

307
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:44,602
(So Min and Seok Jin chose Ji Hyo.)

308
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,713
Jackpot!

309
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:50,274
I have 100 dollars. That's pretty good.

310
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:53,130
I didn't have a bad start.

311
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:56,483
Since Seok Jin isn't as aggressive as others,

312
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,179
I should give some money to a weak member for now...

313
00:11:59,322 --> 00:12:00,837
and get it back later.

314
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:03,092
(Se Chan gets 50 dollars from Jong Kook.)

315
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:04,739
Wait, this means someone sent me 50 dollars.

316
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:08,055
Who could it be? Is it really Jong Kook?

317
00:12:08,532 --> 00:12:11,232
I didn't live a selfish life. At least one person chose me.

318
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,362
(Kwang Soo chose Haha.)

319
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:13,701
Gosh, this is better than I expected.

320
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:14,772
(Thank you, whoever you are.)

321
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:15,954
I have 100 dollars.

322
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:18,363
I have 100 dollars.

323
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:20,664
Seriously? Only one person sent me money.

324
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:22,272
(Only the fool, Jae Seok chose her.)

325
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:23,899
Only one person sent me the money.

326
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,982
(This isn't on pause.)

327
00:12:27,983 --> 00:12:31,022
Other members are talking about from whom they got the money.

328
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:32,335
You might have to wait a bit.

329
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:36,289
- They're still talking about it. - Do you want me to punch you?

330
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:40,232
(This cruel reality is hard for him to bear.)

331
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,531
Rest up for a bit. I have nothing to say.

332
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,831
(Stop filming for a while.)

333
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:46,802
I have nothing to say. I want to be alone. Stop filming now.

334
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,616
Can you clap for the slate?

335
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,142
(Here you go.)

336
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:54,972
(The transfer of Running Money ends as it only wounded Kwang Soo.)

337
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:57,012
- Let's go! - Look at this place.

338
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:58,325
Listen.

339
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:00,211
- You know what? - Watch my clip.

340
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,273
- Don't call yourself a human being. - I...

341
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,845
- I... Okay. - Unbelievable.

342
00:13:05,253 --> 00:13:08,592
I'll be honest. I only sent the money because I had to.

343
00:13:08,593 --> 00:13:10,161
- If not, I wouldn't have. - Of course not.

344
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:11,522
- You bet. - Why would we?

345
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,683
I wasn't going to send anyone the money and give up on it.

346
00:13:14,292 --> 00:13:16,561
- Don't send me fake messages. - Goodness, unbelievable.

347
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,017
Everyone sent fake messages around.

348
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,665
- You know what? I think... - Everyone was all the same.

349
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:25,272
All right. You'll go inside to meet today's guests.

350
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,472
- Really? Okay, shall we go in? - My gosh.

351
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,411
(Will they find today's guests inside?)

352
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:32,711
- This looks like a haunted house. - This isn't scary, right?

353
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,012
(The mysterious darkness fills this space.)

354
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,093
- What is this? - Look at the back.

355
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,852
- This place is huge. - It's huge.

356
00:13:37,853 --> 00:13:38,933
(Today's guests will be in here?)

357
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,466
- Hey. - What is it?

358
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,985
- What is it? - What is that? My goodness.

359
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,134
Where?

360
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,277
- Hey. - Hey, what's going on?

361
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:49,031
- What is this? - What's happening?

362
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:51,502
(What's happening? We were supposed to meet the guests here.)

363
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:54,301
(What on earth awaits the members?)

364
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:55,414
What's going on here?

365
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:57,555
(It's pitch-dark.)

366
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:03,911
(A mysterious-looking man shows up.)

367
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:07,286
(Is this blond man today's guest?)

368
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:11,213
(As the lights come on, a song suddenly starts playing.)

369
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,265
(Drumming)

370
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,921
(The blonde performance group shows themselves in the spotlight.)

371
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,862
(I should film this since it's quite entertaining.)

372
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:24,801
(But who are our guests today? Why is there such a concert?)

373
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,085
- What is that? - What's happening?

374
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:27,743
(Flying)

375
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:31,041
(A group of people fall from the sky.)

376
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:34,071
(Are our guests in there?)

377
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:35,425
(It's a chaos.)

378
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:40,352
(They are professional dancers. They're not the guests.)

379
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:43,346
(Who are today's guests that require such a fancy show?)

380
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:48,196
(Where on earth are the guests?)

381
00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:49,592
(There's another blackout.)

382
00:14:49,593 --> 00:14:50,876
Gosh, what is this?

383
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:56,132
(And three people show themselves in the darkness.)

384
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,331
- Who are they? Who are they? - My gosh.

385
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,571
(Here are our real guests!)

386
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:01,632
- Who are they? - What a way to make an entrance.

387
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,842
(Are these the guests for today?)

388
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:04,994
- These are our guests? - He's holding onto his waist.

389
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:07,293
- Today's special guests. - Who are they?

390
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,581
(They are the trio of today's special guests.)

391
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:11,882
This is Kim Roi Ha.

392
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:14,176
(The first guest is introduced at last.)

393
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,552
(Kim Roi Ha, the best actor for playing the villain)

394
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:21,592
(His authentic acting of a villain swept the screens in Chungmuro.)

395
00:15:21,593 --> 00:15:25,158
(This legendary actor has made it to our show with his lethal charms.)

396
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:28,492
(This is so awesome! The legend has come!)

397
00:15:28,493 --> 00:15:30,732
(We wholeheartedly welcome you, Roi Ha!)

398
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:32,102
Seo Hyo Rim!

399
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,171
(The only female guest is introduced next.)

400
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,071
(Looking lovely)

401
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:38,728
(Seo Hyo Rim, the prettiest and the best actress for the villainess)

402
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:42,342
(She crushed her villainess' role with her almond-shaped eyes.)

403
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:45,878
(An honest, laid-back, and strong woman is joining today.)

404
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:49,421
(It's Seo Hyo Rim! This is awesome. Their jaws drop open.)

405
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,181
(And the last guest is finally introduced.)

406
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:54,522
(It's nice to meet you all.)

407
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:57,491
(Kwak Si Yang, a super rookie among the villains)

408
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,431
(He became a scary villain from a sweet, romantic guy.)

409
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:02,786
(He displayed unexpected charms through his scary acting.)

410
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,433
(Amazing Trio of Villains: Roi Ha, Hyo Rim, and Si Yang)

411
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:08,132
(The performance was for the trio.)

412
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,556
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

413
00:16:09,743 --> 00:16:10,842
(We heartily welcome you.)

414
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:11,902
All right.

415
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,730
Roi Ha, please say hello to the viewers.

416
00:16:14,013 --> 00:16:16,335
Nice to meet you all. Hello, I'm Actor Kim Roi Ha.

417
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:18,724
I'm your biggest fan.

418
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:22,152
- You're so charismatic. - By the way,

419
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,821
- this is his first variety show. - That's right.

420
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:26,307
- Yes, it's my first. - Right?

421
00:16:26,723 --> 00:16:29,862
So this is your first variety show, but you wore a tracksuit to this?

422
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,661
- That's fine. It's Running Man. - That's right.

423
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:35,521
I wore this so I could run, but I'm the only one wearing this.

424
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:39,402
- Why was I asked to wear this? - Their outfits...

425
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,898
- are polar opposites. - They are completely different.

426
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:44,642
They asked me to wear a fancy dress,

427
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:46,041
- so I wore this. - Why...

428
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,311
did no one tell me to dress up?

429
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:49,941
What did they tell you?

430
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,311
They told me to dress casually.

431
00:16:51,312 --> 00:16:53,482
- But this is too casual. - You even wore running shoes.

432
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:54,694
(It looks really casual.)

433
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:57,581
No one has dressed this casually.

434
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,916
They told him to dress casually, so he listened.

435
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,762
(Is this how variety shows work?)

436
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:06,461
When they first appeared, Roi Ha seemed to...

437
00:17:06,462 --> 00:17:08,513
feel shy.

438
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:10,362
He put his hand on his back.

439
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,961
It stopped in the middle.

440
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:13,447
I thought we had only two guests today.

441
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,895
I thought Roi Ha was a cameraman.

442
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:18,118
I thought he was filming...

443
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:19,872
- when I saw him from behind. - You might get in trouble.

444
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,542
- Roi Ha looks a bit angry. - You shouldn't go too far.

445
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,082
You're embarrassing Roi Ha.

446
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,312
Don't go too far.

447
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:27,271
We appeared in "The Sound of Heart" together.

448
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:28,751
That's right.

449
00:17:28,752 --> 00:17:30,904
What was Kwang Soo like while shooting that drama?

450
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:33,172
I'd never seen...

451
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:35,392
such a tall and nice person before.

452
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:37,362
- A tall and nice person? - A tall and nice person.

453
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,122
(A tall and nice person?)

454
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,332
A tall and nice person.

455
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,080
- He's really tall. - He's tall and nice.

456
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,348
I'd never met anyone like him before.

457
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:47,102
In the movies,

458
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:48,902
- Roi Ha usually plays the villain. - He's usually the villain.

459
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:51,201
But actors who play villains a lot seem to be weak in real life.

460
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,829
- That's right. - When they're...

461
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:55,337
- on this show, they're weak. - We've seen that.

462
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:57,937
- Park Hee Soon, for example. - Exactly.

463
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,596
(Do you remember?)

464
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,407
- He is so weak. - Exactly.

465
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,122
One actor lost to me in arm-wrestling.

466
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:06,092
Who was it? Kim Hee Won.

467
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:08,292
- Kim Hee Won. - He was so weak too.

468
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:09,892
(But they were all funny.)

469
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:12,062
(Will Roi Ha make us laugh too?)

470
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,362
Kwak Si Yang is here too.

471
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,302
(Another villain actor, Kwak Si Yang)

472
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,032
Si Yang, how are you feeling?

473
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:20,931
- This is your first appearance. - That's right.

474
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,132
Have you been on many variety shows?

475
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:24,171
- I... - He got married once.

476
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:25,602
- That's right. - He got married.

477
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,593
- You got married to Kim So Yeon. - Yes.

478
00:18:27,843 --> 00:18:29,911
You got married.

479
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:31,042
- He got married? - Yes.

480
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,203
(Surprised)

481
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:36,754
(Why is he surprised?)

482
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,267
Why did you get married so early?

483
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:39,951
That's not what we're talking about.

484
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,033
We're talking about "We Got Married".

485
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,092
(We're talking about a show.)

486
00:18:43,093 --> 00:18:44,421
He didn't get married for real.

487
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,491
He got married on the show.

488
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,977
- So he's not married? - No.

489
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:48,548
He's not married in real life.

490
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:49,832
Hold on.

491
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:51,001
Just on the show.

492
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:52,902
Seok Jin doesn't seem to know that show.

493
00:18:52,903 --> 00:18:54,145
Gosh, Seok Jin.

494
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,521
I thought he got married for real.

495
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,955
Si Yang is here.

496
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:00,171
You're very tall.

497
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,542
- He is. - I'm 187cm tall.

498
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:02,795
You're 187cm tall?

499
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:04,441
Gosh, he's really tall.

500
00:19:04,442 --> 00:19:06,852
Like I always say, that's the right way to become tall.

501
00:19:06,853 --> 00:19:08,166
Don't be like Kwang Soo.

502
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:10,021
- That's the right way. - Kwang Soo...

503
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:11,382
- If you're just tall... - Kwang Soo...

504
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,951
really doesn't look good considering his height.

505
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,292
I'm not jealous at all.

506
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:17,562
They drive me crazy whenever we have tall guests.

507
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:19,862
It would have been better if his face looked better.

508
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:22,562
- What? - Kwang Soo has a long waist.

509
00:19:22,563 --> 00:19:24,249
- What? - Kwang Soo has a very long waist.

510
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:25,602
What are you talking about?

511
00:19:25,603 --> 00:19:26,832
- His waist is 1m long. - My waist is not long.

512
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,116
His waist is 1m long.

513
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:32,001
I once saw Hyo Rim at a cafe near Namsan.

514
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,741
She was wearing no makeup.

515
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:35,257
- Really? - You don't remember?

516
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:37,082
When was it? Oh, right.

517
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,711
You have a worse memory than Seok Jin?

518
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:39,981
Why do you have such a bad memory?

519
00:19:39,982 --> 00:19:41,082
You remembered that?

520
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,052
I'm hurt that Seok Jin remembered it.

521
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,882
If it had been a guy, he wouldn't have remembered.

522
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,468
He wouldn't have remembered.

523
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,852
- Never. - She left a strong impression.

524
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,205
None of us three were wearing makeup.

525
00:19:49,462 --> 00:19:50,806
- That's right. - It might have been...

526
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,982
someone else.

527
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:54,392
- She looks very different... - I...

528
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,562
I came here to get you.

529
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,132
- What do you mean? - Today...

530
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,931
- What are you talking about? - You know each other?

531
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,102
Hold on.

532
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,516
You know each other?

533
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:05,302
Before Kwang Soo debuted,

534
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:07,271
- I presented an award to him. - An award?

535
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,842
- That's right. The commercial... - His commercial became popular.

536
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,641
For the commercial where I shouted, "Ah Reum",

537
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:15,833
- I won an award. - Really?

538
00:20:16,022 --> 00:20:17,921
Wasn't it your first drama?

539
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:20,592
- Yes. - We did a drama together.

540
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:24,056
And he followed me around, drunk.

541
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:26,332
(She suddenly criticizes him.)

542
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,532
He did that before he debuted too?

543
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,562
I didn't.

544
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,102
He does that these days too.

545
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,618
What are you talking?

546
00:20:32,772 --> 00:20:35,132
- I didn't do that. - I mean, in the drama.

547
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,201
- I did that in the drama. - In the drama?

548
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:38,192
- You should be careful. - You should be.

549
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:40,411
I thought he did that back then too.

550
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:42,741
You surprised me.

551
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,308
Let me tell you about today's race.

552
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:48,441
You're going to try to eliminate others and survive.

553
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:50,602
It's called Out Dot Com Race.

554
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,008
- Out Dot Com Race? - Out Dot Com Race?

555
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,451
Out Dot Com.

556
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:58,392
Every round, the member with the least money will be the target.

557
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:00,261
The other members will...

558
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:03,231
participate in an auction through Out Dot Com.

559
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,802
The highest bidder will...

560
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:07,591
win the right to eliminate a member.

561
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,971
Having more money gives you an advantage...

562
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,741
because then you can bid more money.

563
00:21:11,742 --> 00:21:13,459
That's right.

564
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,812
Everyone will want to eliminate Kwang Soo.

565
00:21:16,813 --> 00:21:18,481
Of course. I'll try to eliminate him.

566
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:20,751
- Gosh. - He's our number one target.

567
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,852
We should try to eliminate Kwang Soo.

568
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:24,421
Please choose a number.

569
00:21:24,422 --> 00:21:25,564
I choose one.

570
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:27,262
She's getting the highest amount.

571
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:29,562
- Let's see. The lowest amount. - The lowest amount.

572
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,562
- For Si Yang... - The average amount.

573
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:33,231
(Everyone has Running Money now.)

574
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:35,931
Let's start the race after changing into team uniforms.

575
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:37,102
- Okay! - Okay!

576
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,748
(Current Sums of Money)

577
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:45,001
(A huge water tank hanging from the ceiling?)

578
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:48,104
(This mission has the biggest scale ever.)

579
00:21:48,172 --> 00:21:51,312
(Under the huge water tank is...)

580
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:54,111
(a huge mole game.)

581
00:21:54,912 --> 00:21:57,652
To distribute Running Money and select a target,

582
00:21:57,653 --> 00:22:01,693
let's start Water Tank Quiz.

583
00:22:02,393 --> 00:22:03,991
It's a water tank?

584
00:22:03,992 --> 00:22:04,991
- A water tank? - Are we going into the water?

585
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,456
Two teams will take turns.

586
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:10,332
One member from the offense...

587
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,761
will act out words.

588
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:13,691
- In the water tank? - In the water tank?

589
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,271
How are we going to get up there?

590
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:17,969
- Is that water? - Who is going to do that?

591
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:21,271
(The water tank is safe and used in performances.)

592
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,433
(You can even dance in it.)

593
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:26,379
The rest of the team will play the mole game.

594
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,882
They have to guess the words while avoiding the hammers.

595
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:32,085
The team that gets more words right will win.

596
00:22:32,252 --> 00:22:35,392
The winning team will get 200 dollars.

597
00:22:35,393 --> 00:22:36,661
(The winning team gets 200 dollars.)

598
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,792
- That's a lot. - I'll have to win.

599
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:42,461
The member with the least money in the losing team...

600
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,931
- will become the target. - Automatically?

601
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,357
Once you become the target, you'll be out.

602
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:49,971
- You'll be out. - There's no chance.

603
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:53,144
As Roi Ha and...

604
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:56,011
Seok Jin are the oldest, they'll be the team leaders.

605
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,296
I want to be on Roi Ha's team.

606
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,430
- Definitely. - Please choose me.

607
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:01,911
But we don't know if he's good at games.

608
00:23:01,912 --> 00:23:02,981
Should we play rock-paper-scissors?

609
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,221
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

610
00:23:04,222 --> 00:23:06,122
(The winner can choose a member.)

611
00:23:06,123 --> 00:23:07,552
(Roi Ha wins.)

612
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,751
Roi Ha wins.

613
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,711
- You choose Si Yang? - He's very fast.

614
00:23:10,893 --> 00:23:11,932
Okay.

615
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:14,349
- Roi Ha. - Jong Kook.

616
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,731
- I choose Jong Kook. - Me?

617
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,551
Why did you choose Si Yang, not Jong Kook?

618
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:20,350
Will the game require strength?

619
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,572
- You have to think, right? - Of course.

620
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,941
He thinks Jong Kook is strong...

621
00:23:24,942 --> 00:23:26,342
but stupid.

622
00:23:26,343 --> 00:23:27,941
(Slandering)

623
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:30,411
(Jong Kook only has strength.)

624
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:32,059
You said we have to think.

625
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:35,383
(That's not what I meant.)

626
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,521
Don't say that.

627
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:39,876
- You must be right. - I'm not saying you mean it.

628
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,921
It's just what I think.

629
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,021
You're the target now.

630
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,062
- Okay! Kwang Soo is... - Kwang Soo is...

631
00:23:46,063 --> 00:23:47,548
- saved in my heart. - saved in my heart.

632
00:23:47,932 --> 00:23:49,347
You're saved in my heart.

633
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:53,537
The team leaders, Seok Jin and Roi Ha, will go up.

634
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:55,623
Seok Jin.

635
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:56,971
Team leaders.

636
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:58,517
- Please go this way. - Not us?

637
00:23:58,543 --> 00:23:59,911
See you, Seok Jin.

638
00:23:59,912 --> 00:24:00,971
(Good luck.)

639
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,124
You can do this!

640
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:03,355
See you!

641
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:04,941
Why...

642
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,411
Is it safe?

643
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,711
Yes, it's safe.

644
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,662
Only one person gets the hammer.

645
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:14,521
You'll play cham, cham, cham,

646
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:17,491
and the winning team will get a water gun.

647
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,822
Good. Let's win that.

648
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:19,961
- Let's win that. - Okay.

649
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,931
We can use it against the other team?

650
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,822
We could shoot at their mouths too.

651
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,032
- Si Yang, go. - Me?

652
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:27,271
- Me? - You can do this.

653
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:28,602
We choose Hyo Rim.

654
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:29,771
(We choose Hyo Rim.)

655
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,042
Si Yang, you have to win.

656
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:32,501
You know how to play cham, cham, cham, right?

657
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:35,142
- If I lose, I do this, right? - Right.

658
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:36,557
Should we put them like this?

659
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:38,112
Let's put them like this.

660
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:39,365
- Like this. - Like that?

661
00:24:39,482 --> 00:24:40,867
Si Yang isn't going easy on her.

662
00:24:41,412 --> 00:24:42,882
I'm a girl.

663
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,451
It doesn't matter.

664
00:24:44,452 --> 00:24:45,451
Don't go easy on her.

665
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:46,691
He's strict.

666
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:48,137
- He's very strict. - Fair and square.

667
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,583
I want to see how good Si Yang is.

668
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,792
Play rock-paper-scissors. Start.

669
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:55,348
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

670
00:24:56,033 --> 00:24:57,032
(Si Yang gets to attack.)

671
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:58,532
- Okay. This is important. - Do a good job.

672
00:24:58,533 --> 00:24:59,532
- Hit her. - Do a good job.

673
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,532
Look me in the eye.

674
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:02,231
Cham, cham, cham

675
00:25:02,232 --> 00:25:04,091
(Si Yang wins.)

676
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:05,241
(Hitting)

677
00:25:05,242 --> 00:25:06,727
Cham, cham, cham

678
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,612
(Hitting)

679
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,896
Hold on.

680
00:25:10,313 --> 00:25:11,642
(Did you see that?)

681
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,382
- Si Yang... - What?

682
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:14,882
- Si Yang... - What's wrong?

683
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:16,751
- Come here. - It's a game.

684
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,552
- Hey! - It's a game.

685
00:25:18,553 --> 00:25:21,021
- What did you just do? - What is this?

686
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,152
(Laughing)

687
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,738
Hyo Rim is angry!

688
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:25,362
Her face is red!

689
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:26,776
Come here.

690
00:25:27,063 --> 00:25:28,092
Si Yang.

691
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,562
Hyo Rim's face is so red.

692
00:25:29,563 --> 00:25:30,632
(I just followed the rules.)

693
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:32,001
- Hyo Rim is angry! - Hyo Rim.

694
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:34,132
As soon as you lose, you should cover your head.

695
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,273
- Let's play one more round. - Hit him right away.

696
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,072
(Angry versus strict)

697
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,542
- I'm scared. - She looks different.

698
00:25:40,543 --> 00:25:42,711
Rock-paper-scissors

699
00:25:42,712 --> 00:25:44,211
(Si Yang gets to attack again.)

700
00:25:44,212 --> 00:25:45,411
(Hyo Rim didn't even get to touch the pot.)

701
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:46,665
Cham, cham

702
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:52,382
(Will Hyo Rim be able to protect herself this time?)

703
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:55,080
(Si Yang wins again.)

704
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:56,736
(Hitting)

705
00:25:57,393 --> 00:25:59,080
(Si Yang hits her right away.)

706
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:02,292
- Hold on. What's with you? - What?

707
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:03,961
- What's wrong? - What's with you?

708
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,902
- What do you expect him to do? - Hey!

709
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:07,602
- He's supposed to be fast. - What's with you?

710
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,001
What did I do wrong?

711
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,568
I just did what I was supposed to do!

712
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,142
They told me to do it.

713
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:16,612
- They told him to do it. - I just did my best.

714
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:18,741
- This is too much. - He's just doing his best.

715
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:21,612
He didn't hit her hard. He was just fast.

716
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,021
We started fighting.

717
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,134
(Si Yang is so strict.)

718
00:26:24,952 --> 00:26:26,407
- Si Yang wins! - We win!

719
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,409
- You can have the water gun. - Okay!

720
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:30,421
- Play one more round. - Okay.

721
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,721
We should.

722
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,489
(Meanwhile, by the water tank...)

723
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,832
(Worried)

724
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:37,902
How are we going to do this?

725
00:26:37,903 --> 00:26:38,942
(Worried)

726
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:40,731
(I don't want to be the team leader.)

727
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:41,844
We'll just have to do it.

728
00:26:42,373 --> 00:26:44,261
They should play again.

729
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,671
- They should play again. - Wait.

730
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:48,312
You seem very upset.

731
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:49,928
The prize should be one more water gun.

732
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:51,830
- Seriously. - One more water gun?

733
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:54,411
- Si Yang. - It was a man against a woman.

734
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,282
Hyo Rim played against him.

735
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,082
Next up is Jong Kook against So Min.

736
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,951
No way, I'm not playing.

737
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,062
- Okay. - I'm not doing it.

738
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:05,892
- That's great. - You can do it, Jong Kook.

739
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:07,392
- Okay. - We got it.

740
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,701
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - I'm not going to play.

741
00:27:10,702 --> 00:27:13,501
- You aren't making a sacrifice. - Okay.

742
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:15,372
- Okay. - This is great.

743
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:17,302
Okay, okay.

744
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,292
- Let's go, Jong Kook. - Okay.

745
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,812
- Hold this. - You can do it.

746
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,582
Attack him right away.

747
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,112
(Whispering)

748
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:27,652
- Rock - They're too loud.

749
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:29,852
You're acting like piranhas.

750
00:27:29,853 --> 00:27:32,221
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Look at them.

751
00:27:32,222 --> 00:27:33,721
- You must win. - Rock-paper-scissors

752
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:35,352
(So Min wins.)

753
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:36,691
You have a chance.

754
00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:37,792
(She has the right of command.)

755
00:27:37,793 --> 00:27:38,991
Cham, cham, cham

756
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,922
(She could defeat Jong Kook.)

757
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:45,289
(What's with the pot?)

758
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:49,604
(She tries to attack him with the pot.)

759
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,542
(Why are you giving it to me?)

760
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:53,312
- What are you doing? - Nice shot.

761
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:55,711
- What are you doing? - I was in a hurry.

762
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,681
- I was in a hurry. - Hit him with one hand.

763
00:27:57,682 --> 00:27:58,812
Rock-paper-scissors

764
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,082
(Jong Kook wins.)

765
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:01,930
- Okay, cham, cham, cham - I heard the sound.

766
00:28:01,952 --> 00:28:03,699
- Okay. - He got it.

767
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,822
Cham, cham, cham

768
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,652
(He hits her in 1 second.)

769
00:28:07,653 --> 00:28:09,661
She blocked him, but it got a dent.

770
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:11,915
(The pot is dented after one hit.)

771
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:13,431
(With a dented pot, the game is over.)

772
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:15,191
- She blocked, but it got a dent. - Okay.

773
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:17,001
- Let's go. We won. - Let's go.

774
00:28:17,002 --> 00:28:18,821
- It's ours. - We won.

775
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:22,201
(They must be doing something fun.)

776
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,102
(You didn't forget about us, did you?)

777
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,842
We'll play the final round with a water gun as a prize.

778
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:29,941
- Okay, let's bet on water guns. - We'll take all of them.

779
00:28:29,942 --> 00:28:32,211
- Okay. - Put down the water guns.

780
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:33,495
Both water guns?

781
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,181
Se Chan, you should play with Jae Seok.

782
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,607
- Okay, play with Jae Seok. - Okay.

783
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:41,817
(They try to coach him again. Will it work?)

784
00:28:41,952 --> 00:28:44,691
In which direction should we put the hammer?

785
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,191
- Using the right hand is easier. - Okay.

786
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,832
Change its position after playing rock-paper-scissors.

787
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,562
Rock-paper-scissors

788
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,644
Okay.

789
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:54,072
(He tries to dominate the game.)

790
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,001
- Take off your glasses. - Okay.

791
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,102
- Here we go. - You must block well.

792
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:01,173
- Use one hand diagonally. - Okay.

793
00:29:01,313 --> 00:29:04,009
- That's right. - Do I hit like this?

794
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:07,552
- You should hit like this instead. - Okay.

795
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:09,082
(Hitting)

796
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:12,481
Wait, he's not even playing.

797
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:14,392
- He was demonstrating. - Fine.

798
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:16,615
Did you see that? You must attack him right away.

799
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:18,792
- Here we go. Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

800
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,092
(Se Chan wins.)

801
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:21,103
Okay.

802
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:23,222
(Se Chan has the right of command.)

803
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:24,913
Cham, cham, cham

804
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:27,520
- That was great. - Cham, cham, cham

805
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:29,417
That was great.

806
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:31,741
- Good job. - That's good.

807
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:33,572
- We got it. - Why are you so slow?

808
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:36,208
- You won. - I wanted to hit him once.

809
00:29:36,212 --> 00:29:38,481
- Defend well like Italy. - This is great.

810
00:29:38,482 --> 00:29:39,812
Defend well.

811
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:41,011
(It's Jae Seok's offense.)

812
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,622
Great, here I go.

813
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:43,681
(How will Jae Seok attack?)

814
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:44,794
Stay alert.

815
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:46,437
- Cham, cham, cham - Okay.

816
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,322
- Nice. - Cham, cham, cham

817
00:29:48,323 --> 00:29:49,792
(Se Chan's super defense)

818
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:52,186
- Nice, nice. - You did it.

819
00:29:52,192 --> 00:29:54,062
- Good job. - You used your left hand.

820
00:29:54,063 --> 00:29:56,402
- It was your left hand. - It should have been my right.

821
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:58,632
That was good. It was super defense.

822
00:29:58,633 --> 00:29:59,916
(Current score is 0 to 0.)

823
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:01,402
We need to score.

824
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,542
(The winner gets 2 water guns.)

825
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,391
I can't do this anymore.

826
00:30:06,942 --> 00:30:08,372
I can't do it.

827
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,741
(He tries to get their attention at an important moment.)

828
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:12,481
- Hey. - Wait, this is an important game.

829
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,511
- You're not important. - Stop it.

830
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,921
- Give us a minute. - This is important.

831
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:19,451
Roi Ha can't stand it anymore either.

832
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,502
(Are you listening to me?)

833
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,491
Is that fun?

834
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:23,721
(Will your game be over?)

835
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:24,921
Let's play.

836
00:30:24,922 --> 00:30:27,491
- Rock-paper-scissors - That's good.

837
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,431
After you finish saying, "cham, cham, cham",

838
00:30:30,432 --> 00:30:33,001
- only think about grabbing the pot. - Okay.

839
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:34,001
Just remember this.

840
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:36,629
- Move the fingers like this. - Okay.

841
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,054
Good luck.

842
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,828
- Here I go. - Do it slowly.

843
00:30:40,313 --> 00:30:43,473
- Cham, cham, cham - What?

844
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:46,211
(Is it right or left?)

845
00:30:46,212 --> 00:30:48,612
- What are you doing? - What was that?

846
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,122
- That was it. - You were bewitched.

847
00:30:51,123 --> 00:30:52,536
- I was bewitched? - Next.

848
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:55,014
- Say "cham, cham, cham". - Okay.

849
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,362
- Cham, cham, cham - Okay, that's right.

850
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,575
That's right.

851
00:30:58,992 --> 00:30:59,991
(However,)

852
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:01,632
(why did he grab the squeaky hammer?)

853
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:02,661
That's right.

854
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,532
- Okay. - You can't hit him.

855
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,731
- We got it. - Good job.

856
00:31:06,732 --> 00:31:08,201
- Kwang Soo, you can't hit him. - I was so angry.

857
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:10,001
(You deserve it for cheating.)

858
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,201
- Why did you do that? - I can't do it anymore!

859
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:14,011
- Be quiet. - You can do it!

860
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:16,234
- We're having fun. - I can't do it!

861
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,112
We're doing something important.

862
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:20,738
That's not what's important. Let's go.

863
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:22,211
- Do it once. - Cham, cham, cham

864
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,921
(Se Chan makes a serious attack.)

865
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:27,822
(If he wins one more time, he gets 2 water guns.)

866
00:31:27,823 --> 00:31:30,721
- Okay. - Cham, cham, cham

867
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,915
(Se Chan finally wins.)

868
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:36,001
(The game finally ends.)

869
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:39,802
- Good job anyway. - It was because of my left hand.

870
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:42,701
- We'll shoot a lot of water. - Okay.

871
00:31:42,702 --> 00:31:44,622
(Team Roi Ha wins 2 water guns.)

872
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:48,011
- He's already over there. - That looks amazing.

873
00:31:48,012 --> 00:31:50,164
- You can do it, Roi Ha. - You can do it.

874
00:31:50,182 --> 00:31:52,737
- Aren't you scared? - Are you okay?

875
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:56,082
- That's not it. - Gosh, good luck.

876
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:58,521
If all of us answer correctly, it'd be amazing.

877
00:31:58,522 --> 00:32:00,221
- You're right. - Right?

878
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,849
Only one of us gets hit, so let's go up together.

879
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:04,822
- Okay, bear it. - If you get hit, bear the pain.

880
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:07,191
- Let's go. - Team Roi Ha's question is...

881
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:09,010
about animals.

882
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,632
- The category is animals. - Animals are easy.

883
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:14,271
- Get ready. - The time limit is three minutes.

884
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:15,671
Get ready.

885
00:32:15,672 --> 00:32:16,671
(The time limit is 3 minutes.)

886
00:32:16,672 --> 00:32:18,842
(The first keyword is snake.)

887
00:32:18,843 --> 00:32:20,226
(Squirming)

888
00:32:21,613 --> 00:32:22,612
(Let's go all at once.)

889
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,805
- It's animals. - 1, 2, 3.

890
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:29,421
(Only Si Yang goes up.)

891
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:30,432
What's going on?

892
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,122
Gosh, I can't see.

893
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:39,731
(Only one of us gets hit, so let's go up together.)

894
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:43,902
(Si Yang who follows rules believed what they said.)

895
00:32:43,903 --> 00:32:48,620
(He got tricked by others and became a lonely mole.)

896
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:52,102
(He's the only one who gets attacked.)

897
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,671
(Here I come.)

898
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,187
I can't see.

899
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,606
- It's a snake. - A snake?

900
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,868
Come up now!

901
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:02,652
(Frilled-neck lizard)

902
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,181
(It's a perfect demonstration.)

903
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,221
What's that? Wait.

904
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:08,607
I can't see.

905
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:10,292
(However, they're busy getting hit.)

906
00:33:10,293 --> 00:33:11,592
Don't look.

907
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:13,691
Go back inside.

908
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,931
- What's going on? - They're over here.

909
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,731
(He doesn't care what's going on.)

910
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:20,402
What's that?

911
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:23,100
(He's a lonely, frilled-neck lizard in the jungle.)

912
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:25,642
- I can't see. - Lizard.

913
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:27,511
It's a frilled-neck lizard.

914
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:28,724
Good job.

915
00:33:28,742 --> 00:33:30,530
(Okay, good job.)

916
00:33:31,212 --> 00:33:33,112
(A new animal appears in the water.)

917
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:35,451
- He's moving. - What's that?

918
00:33:35,452 --> 00:33:37,947
(Guess what I am.)

919
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:39,421
- 1, 2. - What's that?

920
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,491
- Let's go up and look. - 1, 2, 3.

921
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:43,562
(The moles go up all at once.)

922
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,592
I know!

923
00:33:44,593 --> 00:33:45,622
(The moles go up all at once.)

924
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:48,087
(Roi Ha demonstrates elegantly.)

925
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,701
Take a guess.

926
00:33:49,702 --> 00:33:51,931
- A turtle? - Jong Kook.

927
00:33:51,932 --> 00:33:55,337
- Is it a turtle? - Hit with this hammer.

928
00:33:55,603 --> 00:33:57,441
(A loud thud)

929
00:33:57,442 --> 00:33:59,312
What was that?

930
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:01,411
- What's going on? - What is it?

931
00:34:01,412 --> 00:34:03,807
- Let's see. - What was that just now?

932
00:34:04,383 --> 00:34:06,211
Wait a minute.

933
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,711
- Jong Kook got him. - What's going on?

934
00:34:08,712 --> 00:34:10,221
Come up.

935
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,434
My goodness.

936
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:14,121
- Let me go. - Do it.

937
00:34:14,122 --> 00:34:16,789
This is not right.

938
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,247
Wait, let me go down.

939
00:34:20,593 --> 00:34:21,844
Wait a minute.

940
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:23,902
What's going on?

941
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:24,902
(Thanks to Kwang Soo,)

942
00:34:24,903 --> 00:34:27,271
(So Min guesses ostrich.)

943
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:29,222
Someone hit me with his hand.

944
00:34:29,573 --> 00:34:32,441
- Gosh, it hurts. - 5, 4.

945
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:35,068
3, 2.

946
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,412
(Are you watching me?)

947
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:38,696
I can't see.

948
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:43,253
(I'm still watching.)

949
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,045
- Okay, time's up. - What's going on?

950
00:34:47,392 --> 00:34:49,888
- Okay. - What's going on?

951
00:34:49,993 --> 00:34:52,962
- This much cheating is nothing. - Of course not.

952
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:55,691
Let's give it a try.

953
00:34:55,692 --> 00:34:57,302
Thank goodness that we have water guns.

954
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,929
- We have to... - I'll go.

955
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,671
- Ballerina. - They're shooting so much.

956
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:03,682
(They work very hard.)

957
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:08,009
(Thanks to Jae Seok and Jong Kook, they answer 10 questions.)

958
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:10,811
You won with a score of 10 to 7.

959
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:12,702
(Team Seok Jin wins.)

960
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,211
- However... - However?

961
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,412
(However...)

962
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,682
- However... - They cheated.

963
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:19,550
Team Seok Jin cheated too much.

964
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:22,322
There's a campaign called You Get Hit If You Cheat.

965
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:24,312
- Did that exist? - Yes, it did.

966
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,685
That's why I got hit when I cheated.

967
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:30,596
(The first candidate was Kwang Soo.)

968
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:32,162
(Kids, if you cheat,)

969
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,302
(you get hit.)

970
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,802
If one member of the team gets flicked in the head,

971
00:35:35,803 --> 00:35:38,101
- we approve of your win. - Si Yang will flick.

972
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:41,311
- We decided who will get hit. - Si Yang doesn't hesitate at all.

973
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:42,929
I do whatever I'm told to do.

974
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:44,541
1, 2, 3.

975
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,856
- Jong Kook. - We pick Jong Kook.

976
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,673
- I knew it. - Okay.

977
00:35:49,422 --> 00:35:51,222
- Okay. - As you know,

978
00:35:51,223 --> 00:35:53,414
- Jong Kook takes revenge. - Of course.

979
00:35:53,422 --> 00:35:54,621
- You must remember that. - I hold...

980
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,592
a lot of grudges.

981
00:35:56,593 --> 00:35:58,092
He holds grudges.

982
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:01,891
It's Si Yang's first time doing it, so he might not control himself.

983
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,448
You won't be on this show again, right?

984
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:05,632
- Will you? - In two months.

985
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:06,902
Don't come back within two months.

986
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,499
I'll shoot a drama just to see you.

987
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,941
Where does Si Yang hang out most of the time?

988
00:36:12,942 --> 00:36:15,371
- Is it Gangnam or Hongdae? - I stay in my neighborhood.

989
00:36:15,372 --> 00:36:16,958
- Where do you live? - Don't tell him.

990
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:18,700
- Ichon-dong. - Ichon-dong?

991
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:20,266
I'll go to Ichon-dong.

992
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:21,912
Cha Tae Hyun lives there.

993
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,191
Tae Hyun moved to Apgujeong.

994
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:28,421
- We went there. - Didn't he tell you?

995
00:36:28,422 --> 00:36:30,191
- Did he move? - Didn't he tell you?

996
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:31,391
Didn't he tell you?

997
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:32,504
(I shouldn't have said it.)

998
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:34,831
He's even more upset.

999
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:37,101
- Why did you say that? - He's more upset.

1000
00:36:37,102 --> 00:36:38,561
(He's too direct.)

1001
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,117
Why did you say that?

1002
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,671
(Tae Hyun, call me when you see this.)

1003
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,116
Why did you say that?

1004
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:45,342
- I'm sorry. - All right.

1005
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:47,771
- Si Yang doesn't know these things. - Let me start.

1006
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,086
He doesn't.

1007
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:53,240
(Si Yang hits Jong Kook so hard.)

1008
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:56,282
(We thank our second honorary ambassador for the clip.)

1009
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:58,822
(You Get Hit If You Cheat)

1010
00:36:58,823 --> 00:36:59,992
(Si Yang hits Jong Kook so hard.)

1011
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:02,421
Si Yang can't control himself. He doesn't know how to do it.

1012
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:04,322
- What is this? - Okay!

1013
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,691
- Si Yang, run! - Okay!

1014
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:08,683
- Did I do something wrong? - You should run.

1015
00:37:08,763 --> 00:37:10,231
- Run! - Okay!

1016
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:11,848
- Run! - What's wrong?

1017
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,085
Run!

1018
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,041
Okay. You get hit if you cheat.

1019
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,356
(I'll remember that.)

1020
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:21,986
(Running Man makes sure every cheater gets reprimanded.)

1021
00:37:22,272 --> 00:37:24,811
Team Seok Jin wins...

1022
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,741
and gets 200 dollars.

1023
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:29,152
Good work.

1024
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:30,652
- Is everyone getting 40 dollars? - Is everyone getting 40 dollars?

1025
00:37:30,653 --> 00:37:32,822
No, no. Hey! What are you talking about?

1026
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:35,247
- I should get 100. I went up there. - What are you talking about?

1027
00:37:35,292 --> 00:37:37,592
- It was hard for us too. - Guys!

1028
00:37:37,593 --> 00:37:38,891
I wish I'd been up there.

1029
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:41,084
- Let's divide it up. - No.

1030
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,162
Then...

1031
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,718
4 of us will get 50 dollars, and 1 of us will get nothing.

1032
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:47,162
I wrote 50 dollars on 4 of these, and 0 on the last one.

1033
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:50,001
- Let's do that. - Good.

1034
00:37:50,002 --> 00:37:53,204
Pick one. Let's start from Hyo Rim.

1035
00:37:53,442 --> 00:37:54,541
Show it to us.

1036
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,996
- Open it. - Is it zero?

1037
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,194
- Open it right now. - Is it zero?

1038
00:37:57,712 --> 00:37:58,925
It must be zero.

1039
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:01,512
- Show us. - Is it zero?

1040
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,652
Ta-da!

1041
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:05,822
(I get 50 dollars.)

1042
00:38:05,823 --> 00:38:07,251
She was acting.

1043
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,691
It's 1 in 4 now.

1044
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:10,791
1 in 4.

1045
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:13,923
(3 of them will get 50 dollars, and 1 of them will get nothing.)

1046
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,532
(Seok Jin has made his choice.)

1047
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:19,302
If I get nothing, I'm doomed.

1048
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:21,572
My luck...

1049
00:38:21,573 --> 00:38:23,926
- Open it right away. - Let's see.

1050
00:38:25,142 --> 00:38:28,242
(Seok Jin came up with this idea.)

1051
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:31,641
(He gets nothing.)

1052
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,152
(The others get 50 dollars.)

1053
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:35,000
- What happened? - Oh, my.

1054
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:38,182
(He's so unlucky.)

1055
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,351
- Oh, my. - How?

1056
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:42,421
(Seok Jin is the one who went into the water tank.)

1057
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,521
How can this be possible?

1058
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:46,932
He went up there and everything.

1059
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:50,501
Among the losing members,

1060
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:52,795
two have the least money and have become the targets.

1061
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:54,032
Two?

1062
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,043
(2 members become the targets.)

1063
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,171
(Lee Kwang Soo and Kim Roi Ha)

1064
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,697
- Please start the bidding. - Gosh.

1065
00:39:01,812 --> 00:39:03,600
Our first targets are very strong.

1066
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:05,194
Gosh.

1067
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,751
I want it so badly.

1068
00:39:07,752 --> 00:39:11,823
(Jong Kook wants the right. How much will Jong Kook bid?)

1069
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,120
(Careful)

1070
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,453
(Exposed)

1071
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:21,691
(He is done bidding.)

1072
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,702
Gosh.

1073
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:23,862
(He notices Jae Seok.)

1074
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,045
You shouldn't look.

1075
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:27,826
12 dollars for Roi Ha? Then...

1076
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:29,885
I want it so badly.

1077
00:39:30,642 --> 00:39:32,692
(Are you talking about me?)

1078
00:39:32,942 --> 00:39:35,194
(Peeking)

1079
00:39:36,712 --> 00:39:37,722
Gosh.

1080
00:39:38,513 --> 00:39:40,330
What is this?

1081
00:39:40,783 --> 00:39:42,095
I should raise my bid.

1082
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:45,621
(Everyone has to send their bids.)

1083
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:46,804
Is it too little?

1084
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,613
Should I bid more? I have the money anyway.

1085
00:39:50,062 --> 00:39:52,346
(Everyone is done bidding.)

1086
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:54,932
(Who will win the right to eliminate Roi Ha and Kwang Soo?)

1087
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,750
Let me announce the result.

1088
00:39:56,933 --> 00:39:58,601
The right to eliminate Roi Ha...

1089
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:00,532
(First up is Roi Ha.)

1090
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,331
goes to someone who bid 70 dollars.

1091
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:04,871
(Someone bid 70 dollars.)

1092
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:07,072
- 70 dollars? - 70 dollars?

1093
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,412
It's one person.

1094
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:10,563
It's more than what I had in the first place.

1095
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,981
- They must have a lot of money. - I know.

1096
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:15,175
And the right to eliminate Kwang Soo...

1097
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:16,382
was sold for 90 dollars.

1098
00:40:16,383 --> 00:40:19,521
(It was sold for even more money.)

1099
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:21,592
- 90 dollars? - Who is it?

1100
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,886
- 90 dollars? - Oh, my.

1101
00:40:24,093 --> 00:40:26,432
- My bid was nothing. - Someone has a lot of money.

1102
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:29,702
- You're expensive. - I don't feel bad.

1103
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:31,202
90 dollars?

1104
00:40:31,203 --> 00:40:33,829
- Kwang Soo is happy. - Thank you, guys.

1105
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,331
Thank you.

1106
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,625
(Who bought the rights to eliminate the two members?)

1107
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:38,941
(They move to a restaurant.)

1108
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:42,578
By the way, I don't know who they are,

1109
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:46,282
but some people seem to want to spend a lot of money.

1110
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:49,882
- You might... - If someone bid 90 dollars,

1111
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:52,621
- it can't be one of us. - It must be Hyo Rim.

1112
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,791
I think it's a guest.

1113
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:57,691
As Si Yang is so rigid...

1114
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,612
- That's right. - It's possible.

1115
00:40:59,863 --> 00:41:02,662
I bid 30 dollars, and I thought it was a lot.

1116
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:04,402
30 dollars can't do anything.

1117
00:41:04,403 --> 00:41:05,932
- I... - Hey!

1118
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,501
You bid 18 dollars.

1119
00:41:07,502 --> 00:41:09,842
(I saw you bidding.)

1120
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,171
So I bid 18 dollars and 10 cents.

1121
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,566
If you're scared, stay out of it.

1122
00:41:13,672 --> 00:41:17,041
- He's bad at betting. - He's so petty.

1123
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:18,861
- Okay. - On that note,

1124
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:21,612
we'll release some more Running Money.

1125
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,222
- Good. We need it. - We need it.

1126
00:41:23,223 --> 00:41:25,052
- Give us a chance. - I like it.

1127
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:27,679
The first mission is "Random Five Second Talk".

1128
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:32,455
You'll be given 3 random questions about a member.

1129
00:41:32,663 --> 00:41:35,691
- Give 3 answers in 5 seconds. - Okay.

1130
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:36,902
We can just say whatever.

1131
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:40,171
If you succeed, you'll get 30 dollars.

1132
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:41,687
That's a lot.

1133
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,671
- That'd help a lot. - That's a lot.

1134
00:41:43,672 --> 00:41:44,671
It's a lot of money.

1135
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:48,784
First, we'll ask So Min about Si Yang.

1136
00:41:50,283 --> 00:41:51,641
She's been...

1137
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,081
She's even sitting next to him.

1138
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,334
- What is she doing? - What is she doing?

1139
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,782
It's so funny when she covers her mouth.

1140
00:41:57,783 --> 00:41:59,822
- Stop it now. - I love it.

1141
00:41:59,823 --> 00:42:01,034
I love it.

1142
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:05,426
I'll look at this camera since it's about Si Yang.

1143
00:42:05,462 --> 00:42:07,310
(Uncomfortable)

1144
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:09,532
Why would you look at that camera?

1145
00:42:09,533 --> 00:42:10,932
For a two shot.

1146
00:42:10,933 --> 00:42:12,202
- Gosh. - Here goes the question.

1147
00:42:12,203 --> 00:42:13,271
(So Min's Random 5 Second Talk starts.)

1148
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:16,171
What was Si Yang's first impression?

1149
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,789
Cute, lovely, and sexy.

1150
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,085
Pass.

1151
00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:22,441
(You play this kind of game?)

1152
00:42:22,442 --> 00:42:24,433
What do you want Si Yang to say to you?

1153
00:42:25,013 --> 00:42:26,751
"I love you," "I like you," and "give me a hug."

1154
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,981
(What do you want Si Yang to say to you?)

1155
00:42:29,982 --> 00:42:31,282
("I love you," "I like you," and "give me a hug"?)

1156
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,592
Stop it!

1157
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:34,921
- What are you doing? - What was that?

1158
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,362
What was that?

1159
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:38,121
- Why do you laugh like that? - Wake up.

1160
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,162
"I love you," "I like you," and "give me a hug"?

1161
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:42,331
I felt so embarrassed after saying that.

1162
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:44,532
- It doesn't make sense. - It should make sense.

1163
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:47,198
Si Yang is still keeping a straight face.

1164
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:48,802
- He's so cold. - He's not even smiling.

1165
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:51,601
- Shouldn't he be happy? - He's not affected at all.

1166
00:42:51,602 --> 00:42:53,764
Si Yang is so rigid.

1167
00:42:53,942 --> 00:42:56,242
- He's like a robot. - He's like a rock.

1168
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:58,737
- We'll ask Ji Hyo this time. - Okay.

1169
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:01,135
We'll ask her about Haha.

1170
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,581
- About Haha. - We're Mapo Siblings.

1171
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:04,664
Here we go.

1172
00:43:05,022 --> 00:43:07,315
When does Byul scold Haha?

1173
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,391
When he doesn't take care of Dream, when he doesn't take care of Soul,

1174
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:10,605
and when he doesn't do house chores.

1175
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,482
- She's so good. - That was perfect.

1176
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:16,654
What kinds of bad things has Haha said about Jong Kook?

1177
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:17,945
(Hesitating)

1178
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:22,110
(Has Haha said bad things about Jong Kook?)

1179
00:43:22,872 --> 00:43:25,472
"He's rude," "he's mean," and "he shouldn't live like that!"

1180
00:43:25,473 --> 00:43:28,372
("He's rude," "he's mean," and "he shouldn't live like that!")

1181
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:30,012
- Okay. - Good.

1182
00:43:30,013 --> 00:43:31,093
(Hitting)

1183
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,952
You did well.

1184
00:43:33,953 --> 00:43:35,512
I'm...

1185
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,052
- I'm hurt. - Why?

1186
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:39,204
- Ji Hyo said the truth. - It was nice.

1187
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:42,092
- Next question. - You have a good memory.

1188
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:43,405
(I'm impressed, Ji Hyo.)

1189
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:45,948
- Next question. - I've heard them a few times.

1190
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,262
(Everyone is having fun.)

1191
00:43:50,263 --> 00:43:53,000
Roi Ha. Stop looking out the window.

1192
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,648
You'll play soon too.

1193
00:43:54,703 --> 00:43:57,941
- Focus. - You'll play too.

1194
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,271
Here we go.

1195
00:43:59,272 --> 00:44:01,572
We'll ask Hyo Rim about Kwang Soo.

1196
00:44:01,573 --> 00:44:03,481
- Good. - That's great.

1197
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:05,412
- This is it. - It's going to be fun.

1198
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:06,463
Hold on.

1199
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,298
I can't wait.

1200
00:44:08,683 --> 00:44:11,121
Here we go. What are Kwang Soo's strengths?

1201
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:13,314
He's a good actor, he's tall, and he's nice.

1202
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,222
- Good job. - Good job.

1203
00:44:15,223 --> 00:44:18,526
(He's a good actor, he's tall, and he's nice.)

1204
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:21,662
- It was very nice. - It was easy.

1205
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:23,319
- Next question. - Good job.

1206
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:26,101
When do you feel jealous of Kwang Soo?

1207
00:44:26,102 --> 00:44:29,342
When he looks at other girls, when his acting is good,

1208
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:30,655
and when he makes more money than I do.

1209
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:33,112
- She's so honest. - When he looks at other girls?

1210
00:44:33,113 --> 00:44:34,941
- She's honest. - Why would you feel jealous?

1211
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,242
- I want him to look at me. - Of course.

1212
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:39,112
- He's a guy too. - It was nice.

1213
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,512
She did well.

1214
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,211
- Just look at me. - She did very well.

1215
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,452
Kwang Soo.

1216
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:45,603
- He's happy. - Kwang Soo is a guy.

1217
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,992
- This is so sudden. - It was...

1218
00:44:47,993 --> 00:44:50,061
- He must be surprised. - What is this?

1219
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,689
- Hyo Rim did a good job. - I want 30 dollars.

1220
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:53,731
Last question.

1221
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,075
What are Kwang Soo's sleeping habits?

1222
00:44:56,663 --> 00:45:00,371
(What? Sleeping habits?)

1223
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:03,402
(It's a very personal question.)

1224
00:45:03,403 --> 00:45:05,671
He snores, grinds his teeth, and hugs something.

1225
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:08,097
(She lists them so easily.)

1226
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:12,247
(They really are Kwang Soo's sleeping habits.)

1227
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:14,311
- What is this? - I don't know.

1228
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:16,382
- It's true. He hugs something. - Kwang Soo...

1229
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:18,052
- He hugs something. - How did you know that?

1230
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:19,492
- Of course, I know. - How?

1231
00:45:19,493 --> 00:45:22,552
We worked together. We shot a drama together.

1232
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,240
- How... - But...

1233
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:27,162
- We shot a sitcom together. - Yes.

1234
00:45:27,163 --> 00:45:28,592
It was pretty good.

1235
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:30,561
- It was... - Pass.

1236
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,231
- It was perfect. - It was.

1237
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:33,601
You get 30 dollars.

1238
00:45:33,602 --> 00:45:34,612
(Hyo Rim gets 30 dollars.)

1239
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,472
- She has so much money. - She's so rich.

1240
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:38,886
We should stop her.

1241
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:40,612
- She's the richest among us. - She's far ahead of us.

1242
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:43,269
This time, we'll ask Seok Jin...

1243
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:45,952
- questions about Roi Ha. - It's going to be fun.

1244
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:48,539
I hurt his feelings in the beginning.

1245
00:45:49,553 --> 00:45:51,021
(They were talking about their ages.)

1246
00:45:51,022 --> 00:45:52,521
Between Roi Ha and Seok Jin, who is older?

1247
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:54,152
Aren't you younger than me?

1248
00:45:54,153 --> 00:45:56,183
(Arrogant)

1249
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,461
I was born in the Year of the Snake.

1250
00:45:57,462 --> 00:46:00,291
(Roi Ha is one year older.)

1251
00:46:00,292 --> 00:46:01,532
You're older than me.

1252
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,220
(You're older than me.)

1253
00:46:03,232 --> 00:46:04,561
Why are you so rude?

1254
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:05,932
(Surprised)

1255
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,132
- Gosh. - I mean...

1256
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:09,365
- What did he just do? - What did you do?

1257
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:11,490
What did he do?

1258
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:14,041
He should be caned.

1259
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:15,171
(They started off on the wrong foot.)

1260
00:46:15,172 --> 00:46:17,870
I'll make it up to you.

1261
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:19,811
I was rude to him.

1262
00:46:19,812 --> 00:46:22,176
We'll see some bromance today.

1263
00:46:22,553 --> 00:46:23,836
Really.

1264
00:46:23,922 --> 00:46:25,094
We haven't seen...

1265
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:27,521
middle-aged men's bromance...

1266
00:46:27,522 --> 00:46:28,722
in a while.

1267
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:30,107
- Okay. - Here goes the first question.

1268
00:46:30,223 --> 00:46:31,222
Here we go.

1269
00:46:31,223 --> 00:46:33,291
What nicknames would you give Roi Ha?

1270
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,262
(What nicknames would you give Roi Ha?)

1271
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,702
- Sneaky... - The time is up.

1272
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:37,774
(Sneaky)

1273
00:46:38,403 --> 00:46:40,532
(Sneaky?)

1274
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:41,932
- What do you mean? - What do you mean?

1275
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,659
- What? - What did you say?

1276
00:46:43,743 --> 00:46:45,601
- Listen. - Does that even make sense?

1277
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,671
Sneaky?

1278
00:46:46,672 --> 00:46:48,141
He isn't witty at all.

1279
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:49,742
- Sneaky. - He isn't witty.

1280
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,141
- Sneaky sounds cute. - What is sneaky?

1281
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,182
(It's bromance between two old men.)

1282
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,351
We'll ask a question about Seok Jin...

1283
00:46:55,352 --> 00:46:57,021
to Roi Ha.

1284
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,751
I think he will be good at this.

1285
00:46:58,752 --> 00:47:00,452
- All right. - Just do it.

1286
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:01,552
Let's see.

1287
00:47:01,553 --> 00:47:03,362
When are you embarrassed by him?

1288
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,561
(Silence)

1289
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:06,976
When no one laughs.

1290
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:10,262
(When no one laughs, Roi Ha is embarrassed.)

1291
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:12,657
- That's right. - That never happens.

1292
00:47:12,903 --> 00:47:14,972
He only said, "when no one laughs".

1293
00:47:14,973 --> 00:47:16,371
- Roi Ha. - Listen.

1294
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:17,716
I'm doing very well these days.

1295
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:19,572
- Roi Ha. - I like when no one laughs.

1296
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:21,512
I think he meant it. He's really sorry for saying it.

1297
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:22,897
- Just do it, Roi Ha. - It became...

1298
00:47:23,042 --> 00:47:24,427
extremely awkward between them.

1299
00:47:24,582 --> 00:47:26,882
- What's going on? - I'll take a taxi instead.

1300
00:47:26,883 --> 00:47:29,152
- Bromance is over. - This is the worst.

1301
00:47:29,153 --> 00:47:30,652
(How will their bromance end?)

1302
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:32,673
Here's your next mission.

1303
00:47:32,852 --> 00:47:34,552
It's called Hand and Body Separately.

1304
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:36,191
- This is difficult. - It's hard.

1305
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,722
- Don't we have to act cute? - "Act cute"?

1306
00:47:38,723 --> 00:47:41,622
Listen to the question given by the staff.

1307
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:43,618
Say the answer...

1308
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:46,231
while showing the wrong answer with your hand.

1309
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:48,091
- It's hard. - I have to score here.

1310
00:47:48,772 --> 00:47:50,171
I'll give it a try.

1311
00:47:50,172 --> 00:47:51,515
Here comes Jae Seok.

1312
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,972
- It requires... - He's a math genius.

1313
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,572
separation of the brain from the hand.

1314
00:47:54,573 --> 00:47:56,481
Here comes Jae Seok, a math genius.

1315
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,141
When I was young, the only private class...

1316
00:47:58,142 --> 00:48:00,537
- I took was how to use an abacus. - Really?

1317
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:01,811
You must be good at it.

1318
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,682
I can't imagine your being good at math.

1319
00:48:03,683 --> 00:48:05,198
- I learned how to use an abacus. - All right.

1320
00:48:05,453 --> 00:48:06,452
Start.

1321
00:48:06,453 --> 00:48:08,751
- Hand and Body Separately, start - Hand and Body Separately, start

1322
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,121
2 minus 1 equals?

1323
00:48:10,122 --> 00:48:12,421
(They must say 1 and show a wrong number with their fingers.)

1324
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,461
(What?)

1325
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:14,691
What?

1326
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,178
(He makes an unknown sound.)

1327
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,976
What kind of answer is that?

1328
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:21,271
- I... I was startled. - Wait a minute.

1329
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:23,072
- Wait a minute. - Goodness.

1330
00:48:23,073 --> 00:48:24,789
- It's because I was startled. - He just made a sound.

1331
00:48:24,903 --> 00:48:25,941
No, no.

1332
00:48:25,942 --> 00:48:27,558
- Were you startled? Okay. - I was.

1333
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:29,941
- Get ready. - All right.

1334
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,311
- Get ready. - I'm not ready yet.

1335
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:33,811
- Hand and Body Separately, start - Hand and Body Separately, start

1336
00:48:33,812 --> 00:48:35,298
9 minus 1 equals?

1337
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,633
Mouth.

1338
00:48:37,723 --> 00:48:39,652
(What kind of number is mouth?)

1339
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:42,521
"Mouth"? What is he saying?

1340
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,722
- What do you mean? - He says strange things.

1341
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,147
I have no idea.

1342
00:48:46,832 --> 00:48:48,731
- Gosh. - I can't help it.

1343
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:50,147
- Come on. - You try it.

1344
00:48:51,203 --> 00:48:53,331
Where did you learn how to use an abacus?

1345
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:55,524
Hey, be quiet.

1346
00:48:55,803 --> 00:48:58,529
- This is how a math genius falls. - Goodness.

1347
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,794
Next is Roi Ha's turn.

1348
00:49:00,913 --> 00:49:02,357
Start.

1349
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,210
- Hand and Body Separately, start - Hand and Body Separately, start

1350
00:49:05,283 --> 00:49:06,970
2 plus 1 equals?

1351
00:49:08,752 --> 00:49:09,822
Three.

1352
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:12,479
(He says the correct answer, but what do his fingers show?)

1353
00:49:12,622 --> 00:49:15,291
(He thinks about showing the wrong answer.)

1354
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:16,822
(He puts up three fingers.)

1355
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:18,579
What's that, Roi Ha?

1356
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:21,592
Rock and roll!

1357
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:23,202
Rock and roll, peace.

1358
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:24,202
Peace.

1359
00:49:24,203 --> 00:49:25,331
Come on.

1360
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:27,902
- Come on, everybody. - Come on.

1361
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:29,231
Yes, come on.

1362
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,371
Rock and roll.

1363
00:49:30,372 --> 00:49:31,601
He's like an idol singer.

1364
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,811
- Yes. - He's an idol singer.

1365
00:49:32,812 --> 00:49:34,086
I meant to do something else.

1366
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:36,041
It isn't easy.

1367
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:38,182
- Goodness. - We'll give you another chance.

1368
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,476
- Hand and Body Separately, start - Hand and Body Separately, start

1369
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,328
2 plus 5 equals?

1370
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:44,021
Eight.

1371
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,052
(His hand shows the rock and roll sign.)

1372
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,322
(No matter what the answer is, it's always rock and roll.)

1373
00:49:48,323 --> 00:49:50,111
- What is he doing with his hand? - Yes.

1374
00:49:50,192 --> 00:49:52,461
- Rock and roll. - Peace.

1375
00:49:52,462 --> 00:49:54,262
- Rock and roll. - Peace.

1376
00:49:54,263 --> 00:49:55,961
(His rock music spirit comes out.)

1377
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:57,922
He likes rock music a lot.

1378
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:00,532
That's what he likes.

1379
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:03,168
(What opportunity awaits them at the restaurant?)

1380
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,702
(They arrive at a naengmyeon restaurant.)

1381
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:06,925
It must be naengmyeon.

1382
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:09,012
It's bossam and naengmyeon.

1383
00:50:09,013 --> 00:50:10,557
- This is great. - Yes.

1384
00:50:10,843 --> 00:50:13,652
(What? There are squeaky hammers.)

1385
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:16,382
(What kind of squeaky hammer mission awaits them?)

1386
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:18,121
- Are you happy with your seats? - Yes.

1387
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,251
(Everyone takes a seat randomly.)

1388
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:22,999
(It's a mission where you hit the person next to you.)

1389
00:50:23,462 --> 00:50:24,691
(He gets a chance to hit Jong Kook.)

1390
00:50:24,692 --> 00:50:27,932
It's a chance to win money and meal tickets.

1391
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,262
(Running Money and meal ticket mission)

1392
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:32,331
It's Funny Scene Quiz.

1393
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:33,746
- "Funny Scene Quiz"? - "Scene Quiz"?

1394
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:36,041
Watch the given scene.

1395
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:38,941
The member to answer correctly gains one point.

1396
00:50:38,942 --> 00:50:41,842
If the answer is wrong, you get hit from the person next to you.

1397
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:42,993
(Guess the next line.)

1398
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:46,847
You receive Running Money depending on your points.

1399
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:51,652
The top five members get naengmyeon and grilled meat.

1400
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:53,168
- The top 5? - The top 5.

1401
00:50:53,252 --> 00:50:54,636
We need to rank top five.

1402
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:56,308
Today's naengmyeon looks delicious.

1403
00:50:56,422 --> 00:50:59,665
The member who earns the least amount of money...

1404
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:01,307
- will be eliminated. - Eliminated?

1405
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,662
It'll be amazing to place first.

1406
00:51:03,663 --> 00:51:05,956
Here's the first question. Play.

1407
00:51:06,933 --> 00:51:08,518
Sir... Sir.

1408
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:12,001
Pardon me, but how do you know our chief?

1409
00:51:12,002 --> 00:51:14,971
(What's the following line by Choi Min Sik?)

1410
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:18,846
(It's a famous scene from a movie.)

1411
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,452
- I've seen it. - I saw it such a long time ago.

1412
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:22,524
(We'll reveal the answer first.)

1413
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:26,492
Pardon me, but how do you know our chief?

1414
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:29,152
- Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong? - Yes.

1415
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:31,345
You punk, do you know what I did?

1416
00:51:31,462 --> 00:51:34,320
Your chief and I ate together yesterday.

1417
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:37,402
We went to a sauna together. We did everything.

1418
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,150
(Here's the answer.)

1419
00:51:39,272 --> 00:51:40,871
Do we have to say the exact lines?

1420
00:51:40,872 --> 00:51:43,933
Yes, but we'll approve of it if it's close enough.

1421
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:46,767
- I know the answer. - It's quite tricky.

1422
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:49,012
"Your chief?"

1423
00:51:49,013 --> 00:51:50,382
"He lives in Deungchon-dong, right?"

1424
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:51,612
"Deungchon-dong"?

1425
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:53,481
(Namcheon-dong is correct.)

1426
00:51:53,482 --> 00:51:55,012
(Where did Deungchon-dong come from?)

1427
00:51:55,013 --> 00:51:56,952
SBS is in Deungchon-dong.

1428
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,182
What did you say?

1429
00:51:58,183 --> 00:51:59,791
- That's in Seoul. - It's Namcheon-dong.

1430
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:00,891
Deungchon-dong is in Seoul.

1431
00:52:00,892 --> 00:52:02,538
Lift up your head.

1432
00:52:02,663 --> 00:52:05,217
(She gives a good hit.)

1433
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:07,815
- That was hard. - His neck is gone.

1434
00:52:07,993 --> 00:52:09,092
His neck is gone.

1435
00:52:09,093 --> 00:52:10,202
(Roi Ha smiles big.)

1436
00:52:10,203 --> 00:52:11,862
- Good job. His neck disappeared. - I hit him too hard.

1437
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,132
How did it happen?

1438
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:14,446
- I know the answer. - Si Yang.

1439
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:15,985
Si Yang is about to answer.

1440
00:52:16,172 --> 00:52:19,445
"Hey, your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1441
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:23,541
"I eat with your chief."

1442
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:25,342
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1443
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:27,676
(Jong Kook gets up.)

1444
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,021
(He's waiting for Si Yang to get it wrong.)

1445
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,552
"We went to a sauna together."

1446
00:52:31,553 --> 00:52:33,068
"We did everything together."

1447
00:52:34,292 --> 00:52:35,403
It's incorrect.

1448
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,044
You punk, you deserve a hit.

1449
00:52:38,263 --> 00:52:39,362
It's incorrect.

1450
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:41,555
(Jong Kook spits out water.)

1451
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:44,288
(Si Yang got it wrong, didn't he?)

1452
00:52:44,433 --> 00:52:45,745
Jong Kook.

1453
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:47,418
Jong Kook got his forehead slapped.

1454
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:51,771
(It was a big slap.)

1455
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:54,944
(Jong Kook got knocked down by Si Yang's uncontrolled swing.)

1456
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,639
(I only did what I was told.)

1457
00:52:57,942 --> 00:52:59,012
(He made the wrong choice.)

1458
00:52:59,013 --> 00:53:00,112
(He realizes it now.)

1459
00:53:00,113 --> 00:53:01,581
He hit his forehead.

1460
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:04,006
It hurts if you keep your cap on.

1461
00:53:04,082 --> 00:53:05,637
Poor Si Yang.

1462
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:07,492
You did a good job.

1463
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:09,846
(A loud thud)

1464
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:12,885
- Oh, no. - It wasn't his full strength.

1465
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:15,675
Poor Si Yang.

1466
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:17,579
- It got dented. - I know the answer.

1467
00:53:19,303 --> 00:53:20,485
There's one more.

1468
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,101
- "Your chief..." - It's wrong.

1469
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:25,072
"He lives in Namcheon-dong, doesn't he?"

1470
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:26,641
"Your chief..."

1471
00:53:26,642 --> 00:53:28,412
- The tone is different. - "He lives in Namcheon-dong."

1472
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,141
It's wrong. It sounds strange.

1473
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:33,112
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1474
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:35,911
- It's strange. - "Your chief lives in..."

1475
00:53:36,053 --> 00:53:38,851
- I know the answer. - "Your chief lives in..."

1476
00:53:39,752 --> 00:53:41,391
- Kwang Soo. - You're terrible.

1477
00:53:41,392 --> 00:53:42,777
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1478
00:53:43,663 --> 00:53:45,662
What was wrong with it?

1479
00:53:45,663 --> 00:53:48,362
Can't you speak with a Busan accent? I know the answer.

1480
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:50,862
Busan is my second home.

1481
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:52,132
How so?

1482
00:53:52,133 --> 00:53:54,231
- No one knows that. - Aren't you from Suyuri?

1483
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,393
My second home is Busan.

1484
00:53:57,573 --> 00:54:01,451
"Hey, your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1485
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:05,512
(Whose voice is that?)

1486
00:54:05,513 --> 00:54:07,502
Isn't it Shin Moon Sun?

1487
00:54:07,752 --> 00:54:09,672
- The answer is Shin Moon Sun. - What are you doing?

1488
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:11,498
This isn't Shin Moon Sun.

1489
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:14,092
"Hey, your chief lives in Namcheon-dong, right?"

1490
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:17,527
- "Yes." - "We drank together yesterday."

1491
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:18,961
"We went to a sauna together."

1492
00:54:18,962 --> 00:54:20,882
- "It's a goal." - I know the answer.

1493
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,032
(Jae Seok fails.)

1494
00:54:23,033 --> 00:54:24,720
- I know the answer. - Let me hit him first.

1495
00:54:26,033 --> 00:54:28,457
- It's a bit... - Comedians said these lines a lot.

1496
00:54:28,573 --> 00:54:31,936
"Your chief lives in Namcheon-dong?"

1497
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,842
"Your chief and I ate together yesterday."

1498
00:54:34,843 --> 00:54:36,512
"We went to a sauna together. We did everything."

1499
00:54:36,513 --> 00:54:37,624
Okay.

1500
00:54:37,683 --> 00:54:39,026
It was missing "yesterday".

1501
00:54:39,383 --> 00:54:41,512
(That was great.)

1502
00:54:41,513 --> 00:54:42,822
How do you know the exact lines?

1503
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:44,197
- "Yesterday". - "Yesterday".

1504
00:54:44,283 --> 00:54:45,970
My goodness.

1505
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:47,521
It's so difficult.

1506
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:48,563
(It's not easy at all.)

1507
00:54:48,653 --> 00:54:51,490
Here's the next question. Play.

1508
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:56,068
(From "The Outlaws")

1509
00:54:57,057 --> 00:55:02,062
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E414 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1510
00:55:02,942 --> 00:55:05,842
Hey, why did you use so much toilet paper?

1511
00:55:05,843 --> 00:55:07,762
You don't even pay taxes.

1512
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:16,149
(How will their conversation continue?)

1513
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,851
- I know the answer. - I know.

1514
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:19,722
- I know the answer. - I definitely know it.

1515
00:55:19,723 --> 00:55:20,992
(I know it.)

1516
00:55:20,993 --> 00:55:22,152
Si Yang was quicker.

1517
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:23,992
(Disappointed)

1518
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:25,680
This is easy.

1519
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:29,061
(What will Si Yang's answer be?)

1520
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:32,132
(We'll reveal the answer for the viewers.)

1521
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:35,702
(Here's the answer.)

1522
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:38,399
- Are you alone? - Yes, I'm still single.

1523
00:55:40,913 --> 00:55:42,529
Hurry up. Let's count.

1524
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:44,424
"Are you here alone?"

1525
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,152
"Yes, I'm single."

1526
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:48,452
(Incorrect)

1527
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:50,021
- It was very close. - That's not it?

1528
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,245
(The expression was too different.)

1529
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:54,164
What could it be?

1530
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:56,921
- I know the answer. - What is it?

1531
00:55:56,922 --> 00:55:58,492
- What? - It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1532
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:01,320
He said he knows the answer. It's his turn.

1533
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:04,362
- What's the answer? - Was his first line incorrect?

1534
00:56:04,363 --> 00:56:07,331
- Yes. - What was the line?

1535
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:08,717
"Did you come alone?"

1536
00:56:08,872 --> 00:56:09,882
Come on.

1537
00:56:09,903 --> 00:56:11,013
(He uses the incorrect accent.)

1538
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:12,742
(He tries too hard to be funny.)

1539
00:56:12,743 --> 00:56:14,811
- Do you want to get hit? - What are you doing?

1540
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:15,871
(You deserve the squeaky hammer.)

1541
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,701
- Hold still. - Okay.

1542
00:56:18,343 --> 00:56:20,231
(He hits without hesitation.)

1543
00:56:20,953 --> 00:56:22,741
- Why isn't he saying anything? - Are you okay?

1544
00:56:23,352 --> 00:56:24,797
- What happened? - His head got pushed in.

1545
00:56:25,153 --> 00:56:26,492
(His head got pushed in.)

1546
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:28,121
- What happened? - It really got pushed in.

1547
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,992
(He pushes up his neck.)

1548
00:56:29,993 --> 00:56:31,336
Where's your head?

1549
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,461
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1550
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:34,961
- I'm okay. - Are you feeling better?

1551
00:56:34,962 --> 00:56:37,032
(They know how to deal with emergency cases.)

1552
00:56:37,033 --> 00:56:38,331
- I know the answer. - Is there an accent?

1553
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:40,323
I definitely watch a lot of movies.

1554
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,616
"Are you here by yourself?"

1555
00:56:43,372 --> 00:56:44,513
"Are you here by yourself?"

1556
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:46,322
And then?

1557
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:47,811
"Yes, I'm single."

1558
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:48,972
That's not it.

1559
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:50,902
- Answer. - Go ahead.

1560
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,599
- I gave it to him. - "Are you here by yourself?"

1561
00:56:54,113 --> 00:56:55,628
"Yes, I'm still single."

1562
00:56:56,752 --> 00:56:58,822
- "I'm still single"? - "I'm still single."

1563
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:00,843
Was this it? Why did I do that?

1564
00:57:01,553 --> 00:57:03,291
You must have watched many films.

1565
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:06,291
Actors are different. They look for these things.

1566
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:09,061
I can't even remember my own lines. This is difficult.

1567
00:57:09,062 --> 00:57:10,476
That's tough.

1568
00:57:11,533 --> 00:57:12,972
I can't remember.

1569
00:57:12,973 --> 00:57:15,402
Roi Ha, give it a try.

1570
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:20,012
- Give me a hint. - Roi Ha, rock and roll.

1571
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:22,171
(He appeals to Roi Ha's rock and roll spirit.)

1572
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:24,465
"Rock and roll".

1573
00:57:24,812 --> 00:57:27,842
- Next question is a choreography. - Choreography?

1574
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:29,722
I'll show you an image,

1575
00:57:29,723 --> 00:57:33,291
and you have to say the lyrics that fit the dance.

1576
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:35,222
- Okay. Good. - The lyrics?

1577
00:57:35,223 --> 00:57:37,112
- Lyrics to the dance. Okay. - Here is...

1578
00:57:37,522 --> 00:57:38,532
the question.

1579
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:42,492
(What dance and lyrics follow this image?)

1580
00:57:43,303 --> 00:57:45,262
- Answer. - "Abracadabra".

1581
00:57:45,263 --> 00:57:47,828
(They have to get the next two lines right.)

1582
00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,641
(I keep going crazy)

1583
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,472
(I'm going crazy)

1584
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:55,493
What was it? This is driving me nuts.

1585
00:57:55,812 --> 00:57:58,409
- I'm going nuts. - I know this.

1586
00:57:58,482 --> 00:57:59,564
I know!

1587
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:02,645
(If you don't know, you shouldn't try.)

1588
00:58:03,653 --> 00:58:04,751
(I keep going crazy)

1589
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:06,540
(I used to be nice, but I'm going crazy)

1590
00:58:07,093 --> 00:58:08,921
- That's not it. - This is making me crazy.

1591
00:58:08,922 --> 00:58:10,762
That surprised me.

1592
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:12,932
- You need to get hit. - I have no idea.

1593
00:58:12,933 --> 00:58:15,231
This is going to be in the trailer.

1594
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:18,667
It's tiring going back and forth. Don't move.

1595
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,101
Don't move.

1596
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:21,487
(It's a clean shot.)

1597
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,171
(Pumping)

1598
00:58:24,172 --> 00:58:25,213
Gosh, this...

1599
00:58:25,872 --> 00:58:28,211
(How many times was that?)

1600
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:29,811
- Gosh. - What?

1601
00:58:29,812 --> 00:58:32,569
How do I... Fine.

1602
00:58:33,252 --> 00:58:34,412
- All right. - I know!

1603
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:37,981
"I used to be 'blank', but I keep going crazy like this".

1604
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:38,992
That's the answer.

1605
00:58:39,522 --> 00:58:40,722
I know.

1606
00:58:40,723 --> 00:58:41,905
(He speaks in a soft voice.)

1607
00:58:42,993 --> 00:58:45,277
- Roi Ha. - I look forward to this.

1608
00:58:45,278 --> 00:58:46,406
- Roi Ha. - Go.

1609
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:51,009
(Can he get the right answer...?!)

1610
00:58:51,522 --> 00:58:52,735
I know.

1611
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:56,061
- Roi Ha. - I look forward to this.

1612
00:58:56,062 --> 00:58:57,577
- Roi Ha. - Go.

1613
00:58:57,662 --> 00:58:59,380
(He finally gets going.)

1614
00:58:59,963 --> 00:59:03,498
(The rock legend has been quietly waiting for the right moment.)

1615
00:59:04,303 --> 00:59:05,383
Good job.

1616
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:08,201
(I want to be nice but)

1617
00:59:08,202 --> 00:59:11,203
Go again from the beginning. Set, go.

1618
00:59:11,343 --> 00:59:13,342
(Swaying)

1619
00:59:13,343 --> 00:59:15,504
(He's becoming unsure.)

1620
00:59:16,113 --> 00:59:17,811
(He's not too sure.)

1621
00:59:17,812 --> 00:59:19,065
"I want to be nice"?

1622
00:59:19,213 --> 00:59:20,581
(The rock star's nice exit)

1623
00:59:20,582 --> 00:59:22,703
I know. Okay.

1624
00:59:23,082 --> 00:59:24,451
(I used to be nice)

1625
00:59:24,452 --> 00:59:26,472
(but I keep going crazy like this)

1626
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:28,362
(Will Ji Hyo's answer be correct?)

1627
00:59:28,363 --> 00:59:29,979
- She's right. - Because of you

1628
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:32,732
(Ji Hyo is correct.)

1629
00:59:32,733 --> 00:59:34,161
- You're right. - "Nice".

1630
00:59:34,162 --> 00:59:35,331
(Here's the answer.)

1631
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:37,032
(I used to be nice)

1632
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:39,699
(but I keep going crazy like this)

1633
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:42,388
- That was awesome. - "Nice".

1634
00:59:42,943 --> 00:59:45,842
- That was awesome. - This is so hard.

1635
00:59:45,843 --> 00:59:48,012
- I'm done. - You're so good.

1636
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:51,043
- I'm not. - Gosh, this is so hard.

1637
00:59:51,113 --> 00:59:53,581
Next question is for the older age group.

1638
00:59:53,582 --> 00:59:55,652
- Good. - You'll be able to get it.

1639
00:59:55,653 --> 00:59:57,340
Here's the next question.

1640
00:59:57,852 --> 00:59:59,322
- We know this. - Na Mi and Boom Boom.

1641
00:59:59,323 --> 01:00:01,121
Is that not it? Is it Firetruck?

1642
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:03,291
("Like an Indian Doll" by Na Mi and Boom Boom)

1643
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:07,931
(It got burnt by the dark loneliness)

1644
01:00:07,932 --> 01:00:10,462
- Okay. - What did he say?

1645
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:12,831
- "Dark loneliness". - I knew too.

1646
01:00:12,832 --> 01:00:14,216
- I almost had it. - What was that?

1647
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,744
(Jae Seok takes all the old songs.)

1648
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:19,572
(He know every word.)

1649
01:00:19,573 --> 01:00:22,241
- He's right. - Goodness.

1650
01:00:22,242 --> 01:00:23,541
(He gets it right again.)

1651
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:24,951
I'm so mad.

1652
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:27,552
(Jae Seok gets 1st place, so he wins 100 dollars and a meal ticket.)

1653
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:29,721
Jae Seok won three points.

1654
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:32,752
- Six of you will get meal tickets. - Okay!

1655
01:00:33,352 --> 01:00:37,200
(The third target will be revealed shortly.)

1656
01:00:37,693 --> 01:00:39,661
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

1657
01:00:39,662 --> 01:00:41,450
Thank you for the meal.

1658
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:43,201
This will take care of the summer.

1659
01:00:43,202 --> 01:00:44,201
(As soon as the food comes out, he starts slurping it.)

1660
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:45,601
I really want the naengmyun right now.

1661
01:00:45,602 --> 01:00:49,271
- It's so refreshing. - There are dumplings and meat too.

1662
01:00:49,272 --> 01:00:51,393
(Meanwhile...)

1663
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:53,860
- Is it good, Jae Seok? - It is.

1664
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:55,894
(Exaggerating)

1665
01:00:56,443 --> 01:00:57,442
(Rockers have to be hungry.)

1666
01:00:57,443 --> 01:00:59,371
The noodles are so chewy.

1667
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:01,252
Roi Ha really wants some.

1668
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:02,667
Can I have a dumpling?

1669
01:01:03,153 --> 01:01:06,122
This is so good. If you show me something...

1670
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,862
- An acrostic poem. - Do it with "king-sized dumplings".

1671
01:01:08,863 --> 01:01:09,962
- "King-sized dumplings"? - Yes.

1672
01:01:09,963 --> 01:01:12,012
- It's simple. King-sized dumplings. - That sounds good.

1673
01:01:12,263 --> 01:01:14,092
Roi Ha, if you do one, I'll give you something.

1674
01:01:14,093 --> 01:01:17,032
- An acrostic poem. I'll give you. - Start it off for him.

1675
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:18,032
"King".

1676
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:19,471
(King)

1677
01:01:19,472 --> 01:01:22,802
- Big Nose. - "Big Nose"?

1678
01:01:22,803 --> 01:01:24,863
(He's startled.)

1679
01:01:25,443 --> 01:01:26,453
"Sized".

1680
01:01:26,742 --> 01:01:28,942
- Do I look easy to you? - Good one.

1681
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:30,741
(Do I look easy to you?)

1682
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:31,752
(Oh, dear.)

1683
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:32,752
Good one.

1684
01:01:32,753 --> 01:01:33,911
(He sounds serious.)

1685
01:01:33,912 --> 01:01:35,322
- So charismatic. - "Dumplings".

1686
01:01:35,323 --> 01:01:37,721
(His facial expression changes.)

1687
01:01:37,722 --> 01:01:39,291
Do you want to die?

1688
01:01:39,292 --> 01:01:41,322
(Do you want to die, Big Nose?)

1689
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,161
- That works. - Nice.

1690
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:45,313
- I'll give you 1 dumpling! - 1 dumpling.

1691
01:01:45,392 --> 01:01:47,561
Good job. Take one dumpling.

1692
01:01:47,562 --> 01:01:49,077
- Good job. - Here's one dumpling.

1693
01:01:49,363 --> 01:01:51,696
He deserves two.

1694
01:01:52,073 --> 01:01:53,471
We don't have that many.

1695
01:01:53,472 --> 01:01:55,664
(Roi Ha settles in, and they move to the final location.)

1696
01:01:57,073 --> 01:01:58,641
Don't we usually run here?

1697
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:00,532
This feels like a race.

1698
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:04,619
Welcome to the headquarters of Out Dot Com.

1699
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:06,652
- Is this the headquarters? - I see.

1700
01:02:06,653 --> 01:02:09,884
You win today's race by being the last one remaining.

1701
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:13,991
Here are the rules for Mission Impossible All Out.

1702
01:02:13,992 --> 01:02:15,161
(Final match: Mission Impossible All Out)

1703
01:02:15,162 --> 01:02:16,462
(Eliminate everybody to win.)

1704
01:02:16,463 --> 01:02:19,192
- "All out". - "All out".

1705
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,789
You have to remove the name tags of the targets.

1706
01:02:21,803 --> 01:02:25,502
A new target is added every 15 minutes.

1707
01:02:25,503 --> 01:02:26,871
(The person with the least Running Money becomes a target.)

1708
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:29,041
Only people who bought the right can take off the name tags.

1709
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:31,442
That's right. If you eliminate somebody,

1710
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:34,311
you can take their Running Money.

1711
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:36,282
(Once you eliminate a target, their money becomes yours.)

1712
01:02:36,283 --> 01:02:39,581
Also, there are R pawnshops.

1713
01:02:39,582 --> 01:02:41,282
(They can recover their asset through it.)

1714
01:02:41,283 --> 01:02:42,595
Really?

1715
01:02:43,323 --> 01:02:44,592
Once you visit,

1716
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:48,056
there will be opportunities to win more Running Money.

1717
01:02:48,263 --> 01:02:50,692
If you win this by yourself,

1718
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,015
- it's an honor. - That's right.

1719
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:55,601
The targets for round one...

1720
01:02:55,602 --> 01:02:57,902
are Roi Ha and Kwang Soo.

1721
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,902
It was 70 and 90 dollars.

1722
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:01,720
The target for round two...

1723
01:03:02,272 --> 01:03:04,072
- is Haha. - Oh, me?

1724
01:03:04,073 --> 01:03:06,612
(Haha is a new target after the quiz earlier.)

1725
01:03:06,613 --> 01:03:10,177
Haha is the target, and his bidding...

1726
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,982
will start once you move to your designated locations.

1727
01:03:12,983 --> 01:03:14,081
Okay!

1728
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,252
(Who will be the last 1 standing?)

1729
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:16,581
- Okay. - Okay, it's Haha.

1730
01:03:16,582 --> 01:03:18,108
I'll go for it.

1731
01:03:19,093 --> 01:03:20,862
We have to work together.

1732
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:22,962
We can't survive on our own. You have to have money.

1733
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:26,598
That's what I mean. I should have saved up some money.

1734
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:28,802
- Haha, you invested in me. - That's right.

1735
01:03:28,803 --> 01:03:30,701
- This is more valuable than money. - I earned you.

1736
01:03:30,702 --> 01:03:33,026
We understand each other so well.

1737
01:03:34,503 --> 01:03:36,871
(After the 1st mission)

1738
01:03:36,872 --> 01:03:40,442
(Kwang Soo suggests that Haha buys his elimination right.)

1739
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:43,978
(Haha only had 100 dollars, but he uses 90 on Kwang Soo.)

1740
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:49,631
(Kwang Soo's value becomes inflated due to the bargain.)

1741
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:53,891
(That's preposterous. What do they have in mind?)

1742
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:56,316
(They act nonchalantly.)

1743
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,458
You have to buy me, and I'll buy him.

1744
01:04:00,162 --> 01:04:04,041
This is an excellent plan.

1745
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:07,641
You have to use it. If you don't, I'll eliminate you.

1746
01:04:07,642 --> 01:04:09,771
Why would I not try?

1747
01:04:09,772 --> 01:04:12,742
I know. You have to write 100 dollars though.

1748
01:04:13,042 --> 01:04:16,982
- Of course. - I'll be listening...

1749
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:18,712
- and if it's 100 dollars, it's you. - 90 dollars.

1750
01:04:18,713 --> 01:04:20,681
- Because... - 90 dollars?

1751
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:23,982
If somebody writes 100 dollars,

1752
01:04:23,983 --> 01:04:26,291
- I have to eliminate you. - Okay.

1753
01:04:26,292 --> 01:04:28,161
- Do you approve? - Yes.

1754
01:04:28,162 --> 01:04:30,521
90 dollars is you.

1755
01:04:30,522 --> 01:04:32,061
- Okay. - 90 or 100 dollars.

1756
01:04:32,062 --> 01:04:34,502
No, don't do that. Don't be vague. It's 90.

1757
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,462
- Okay. - If it's 100, it's not you.

1758
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:38,856
- Okay. - Okay?

1759
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:43,114
- I bid for Roi Ha. - That's right.

1760
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:49,658
(Se Chan bought Roi Ha's elimination right for 70 dollars.)

1761
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:52,282
(He looks weak. I'll try.)

1762
01:04:52,283 --> 01:04:53,827
I have to eliminate him first.

1763
01:04:54,283 --> 01:04:56,201
But his eyes...

1764
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,434
I'm scared.

1765
01:04:59,892 --> 01:05:03,630
(Who's after me?)

1766
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:09,893
It's here. I just got it.

1767
01:05:10,332 --> 01:05:12,902
The target is Haha. "We will start the bidding."

1768
01:05:12,903 --> 01:05:14,302
"The lowest bidding price is 10 dollars."

1769
01:05:14,303 --> 01:05:15,672
(Message)

1770
01:05:15,673 --> 01:05:17,442
(The target)

1771
01:05:17,443 --> 01:05:21,483
(Bidding for Haha starts.)

1772
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:24,411
I'll let this one go. There's no use in winning it.

1773
01:05:25,352 --> 01:05:26,767
Around 18 dollars.

1774
01:05:27,883 --> 01:05:30,252
- Can I not bid? - No.

1775
01:05:30,253 --> 01:05:32,422
(He's frugal.)

1776
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:33,533
10 dollars.

1777
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,422
Should I do 50 or 70?

1778
01:05:36,423 --> 01:05:37,491
(Hesitating)

1779
01:05:37,492 --> 01:05:39,192
(They're all thinking.)

1780
01:05:39,193 --> 01:05:40,362
We're talking.

1781
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,931
(They're all thinking.)

1782
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:43,478
"If you write 90 dollars,"

1783
01:05:44,102 --> 01:05:46,371
"let's meet on the footbridge".

1784
01:05:46,372 --> 01:05:47,786
(To Kwang Soo)

1785
01:05:50,443 --> 01:05:54,842
9, 9, 9, 9, 9.

1786
01:05:54,843 --> 01:05:56,141
Write down "nine".

1787
01:05:56,142 --> 01:06:00,652
(He sounds like a pigeon.)

1788
01:06:00,653 --> 01:06:02,572
(Okay, let's do this.)

1789
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:06,521
(Everybody's done bidding.)

1790
01:06:07,053 --> 01:06:09,042
The bid has closed.

1791
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:14,092
(What will Haha's bidding price be?)

1792
01:06:14,093 --> 01:06:15,445
Haha...

1793
01:06:16,533 --> 01:06:21,148
Haha was auctioned off at 90 dollars.

1794
01:06:21,742 --> 01:06:23,902
(Haha was auctioned off at the promised amount.)

1795
01:06:23,903 --> 01:06:25,125
Yes, it's 90 dollars.

1796
01:06:26,213 --> 01:06:27,271
(Why are things so expensive here?)

1797
01:06:27,272 --> 01:06:28,455
90 dollars?

1798
01:06:29,013 --> 01:06:30,457
The currents targets are...

1799
01:06:30,883 --> 01:06:33,982
Roi Ha, Kwang Soo, and Haha.

1800
01:06:33,983 --> 01:06:36,244
- Okay. - The race will begin in...

1801
01:06:36,582 --> 01:06:37,822
five,

1802
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:39,192
four,

1803
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:40,621
three,

1804
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,991
two,

1805
01:06:41,992 --> 01:06:43,161
one.

1806
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:45,132
- Start the race. - Start.

1807
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:47,132
(All Out Race starts.)

1808
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:49,601
(Current Rankings)

1809
01:06:49,602 --> 01:06:51,117
Hey, friend.

1810
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:54,902
You saved 100 dollars.

1811
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:56,154
Haha.

1812
01:06:56,602 --> 01:06:57,811
Let's give each other a hug.

1813
01:06:57,812 --> 01:06:59,712
(After saving each other, they meet on the footbridge.)

1814
01:06:59,713 --> 01:07:02,975
We have to trust each other. That's what we need right now.

1815
01:07:02,983 --> 01:07:06,417
Let's run. It changes in 15 minutes.

1816
01:07:06,452 --> 01:07:07,533
Let's look for people.

1817
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:10,967
They're going around together.

1818
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,052
Why is Kwang Soo going around with you?

1819
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,082
- I'm the target. - And?

1820
01:07:15,593 --> 01:07:17,322
- Why are you... - No, no.

1821
01:07:17,323 --> 01:07:18,646
Carry on.

1822
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:20,954
What? Carry on?

1823
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:23,626
Jong Kook, I think Kwang Soo bought Haha's.

1824
01:07:23,863 --> 01:07:27,235
Haha bought Kwang Soo's too.

1825
01:07:27,272 --> 01:07:31,050
They're going to eliminate everybody else and fight at the end.

1826
01:07:31,142 --> 01:07:33,092
- The 2 of them? - Yes, I'm 100 percent sure.

1827
01:07:33,372 --> 01:07:34,512
- Each other? - Yes.

1828
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:38,581
It doesn't matter if they know. You have my name tag,

1829
01:07:38,582 --> 01:07:40,906
and I have yours. We don't have to be afraid.

1830
01:07:41,253 --> 01:07:44,081
As long as we don't betray each other, this won't...

1831
01:07:44,722 --> 01:07:47,391
So Min, hurry.

1832
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:51,192
(Meanwhile, some people are at the pawnshop.)

1833
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:52,791
- Hello. - Hello.

1834
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:55,963
How are the prices measured?

1835
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:57,262
It's 10 dollars per cm.

1836
01:07:57,263 --> 01:07:59,596
- Length? Does the width not matter? - No.

1837
01:07:59,803 --> 01:08:01,994
Don't you have to consider the width too?

1838
01:08:02,673 --> 01:08:04,995
- Can I damage it? - You can't.

1839
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:08,112
Give this to me.

1840
01:08:08,113 --> 01:08:10,112
- No, this is separate. - No, it's not.

1841
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:11,597
- No, it's separate. - It's one.

1842
01:08:11,912 --> 01:08:13,782
- This is a set. - It's not.

1843
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:15,351
I have to sell one each.

1844
01:08:15,352 --> 01:08:16,851
- You can't. - That's what pawnshops do.

1845
01:08:16,852 --> 01:08:18,422
It depends on the owner's discretion.

1846
01:08:18,423 --> 01:08:19,592
(Their opinions clash.)

1847
01:08:19,593 --> 01:08:20,621
It's one.

1848
01:08:20,622 --> 01:08:23,046
- I'll just measure this then. - This?

1849
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,179
- How much is it? - 20 dollars.

1850
01:08:25,193 --> 01:08:26,331
- What? - 20 dollars.

1851
01:08:26,332 --> 01:08:28,625
- What about 4 dollars? - It's over 20 dollars.

1852
01:08:28,662 --> 01:08:29,672
I have no coins.

1853
01:08:29,763 --> 01:08:31,692
It's over 20 dollars. Is it still 20?

1854
01:08:31,872 --> 01:08:33,731
I'm going to sell everything.

1855
01:08:33,732 --> 01:08:35,388
Socks. You buy socks too, right?

1856
01:08:35,442 --> 01:08:37,241
- Do you buy people too? - This is 30 dollars.

1857
01:08:37,242 --> 01:08:38,788
- Gosh, no. - 30 dollars.

1858
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:41,342
- Hold on. - There's no value.

1859
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,382
30 dollars.

1860
01:08:42,383 --> 01:08:43,781
- How's this? - No.

1861
01:08:43,782 --> 01:08:46,081
This is a stocking now.

1862
01:08:46,082 --> 01:08:47,552
(Laughing)

1863
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:49,240
- What now? 50 dollars. - Yes, 50 dollars.

1864
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:50,422
50 dollars.

1865
01:08:50,423 --> 01:08:51,522
(He stretches the sock and earns 50 dollars.)

1866
01:08:51,523 --> 01:08:52,907
20 dollars for the shoe.

1867
01:08:52,923 --> 01:08:54,491
- 30 dollars. - 20 dollars.

1868
01:08:54,492 --> 01:08:57,896
30 dollars. Look at you. You're not flexible.

1869
01:08:57,992 --> 01:09:00,012
Can I... Well...

1870
01:09:01,202 --> 01:09:02,374
Hold on.

1871
01:09:03,162 --> 01:09:04,302
Can I sell underclothes too?

1872
01:09:04,303 --> 01:09:06,831
(Can I sell underclothes too?)

1873
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:07,941
You can't.

1874
01:09:07,942 --> 01:09:10,401
Hey. Oh, gosh.

1875
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:11,989
Who will buy it?

1876
01:09:12,643 --> 01:09:14,330
I think it'll be this long.

1877
01:09:14,343 --> 01:09:16,111
- I'm okay. - Go away.

1878
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:18,537
Go away! She's insane.

1879
01:09:18,652 --> 01:09:21,722
That's too much. Who will buy it?

1880
01:09:21,723 --> 01:09:22,763
(It's hot. Please watch out for rude customers.)

1881
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:25,951
As long as we don't betray each other, we'll be fine.

1882
01:09:26,423 --> 01:09:28,886
In 15 minutes, there will be a new target.

1883
01:09:29,223 --> 01:09:32,031
- He's a target. - Sorry?

1884
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:33,578
He's a target. Why are you leaving him?

1885
01:09:33,692 --> 01:09:35,279
- Leaving who? - I...

1886
01:09:35,532 --> 01:09:37,119
don't know who bid for me.

1887
01:09:37,402 --> 01:09:39,972
- If you didn't win the bid, - Roi Ha.

1888
01:09:39,973 --> 01:09:42,071
- Where's Roi Ha? - do you do nothing?

1889
01:09:42,072 --> 01:09:43,541
Where's Roi Ha?

1890
01:09:43,542 --> 01:09:45,272
(Grabbing)

1891
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:46,555
No, what's this?

1892
01:09:46,612 --> 01:09:47,642
Where's Roi Ha?

1893
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:49,581
(He follows quietly and attacks.)

1894
01:09:49,582 --> 01:09:50,724
Why are you doing this?

1895
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,581
What's this?

1896
01:09:52,582 --> 01:09:53,911
(Haha is out in a second.)

1897
01:09:53,912 --> 01:09:55,034
Jae Seok...

1898
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:58,722
(Why did Jae Seok get him and not Kwang Soo?)

1899
01:09:58,723 --> 01:09:59,935
What happened?

1900
01:10:01,023 --> 01:10:02,173
Did he win the bid?

1901
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,592
What do I do?

1902
01:10:05,593 --> 01:10:07,161
(After the bargain with Haha)

1903
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:08,617
- Hello, Jae Seok. - Yes, what is it?

1904
01:10:08,862 --> 01:10:13,132
I'm calling to do something good for you.

1905
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:15,294
- What is it? - If...

1906
01:10:15,603 --> 01:10:17,492
you buy Haha...

1907
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:20,540
- at 90 dollars, - Okay.

1908
01:10:20,773 --> 01:10:24,752
I will let you know where he is.

1909
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:28,081
Are you sure? If I buy him at 90 dollars,

1910
01:10:28,082 --> 01:10:31,052
- will you let me know where he is? - I promise.

1911
01:10:31,053 --> 01:10:32,203
(I don't have to do the work.)

1912
01:10:33,523 --> 01:10:35,482
- Okay. I got it. - All right.

1913
01:10:35,992 --> 01:10:37,222
Is 19 dollars okay?

1914
01:10:37,223 --> 01:10:38,607
(Is 19 dollars okay?)

1915
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:42,562
(He handed over Haha and bet a small amount.)

1916
01:10:42,563 --> 01:10:44,047
(My bidding amount is 19 dollars.)

1917
01:10:44,532 --> 01:10:46,002
(I'll trust Kwang Soo this one time.)

1918
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:47,244
Like Kwang Soo said, I'll do 90 dollars.

1919
01:10:47,742 --> 01:10:49,672
(Jae Seok won Haha's elimination right at 90 dollars.)

1920
01:10:49,673 --> 01:10:50,772
I sent it.

1921
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:52,388
(Jae Seok won Haha's elimination right at 90 dollars.)

1922
01:10:53,013 --> 01:10:54,111
Hey.

1923
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:55,699
(He clenches his teeth.)

1924
01:10:56,383 --> 01:10:57,512
Thanks.

1925
01:10:57,513 --> 01:10:58,611
(You're unbelievable.)

1926
01:10:58,612 --> 01:11:01,682
He wants to stop the long slavery.

1927
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:03,367
He called and told me.

1928
01:11:03,482 --> 01:11:06,017
- You can talk it out. - My 100 dollars...

1929
01:11:06,822 --> 01:11:08,206
You were next to me.

1930
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:09,533
How could you...

1931
01:11:09,992 --> 01:11:11,244
I wrote it.

1932
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:13,514
I wrote 19 dollars.

1933
01:11:15,003 --> 01:11:16,478
I had no choice.

1934
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:19,331
- Once you're eliminated, I'm next. - Hey.

1935
01:11:19,332 --> 01:11:20,502
How could you...

1936
01:11:20,503 --> 01:11:22,259
Haha.

1937
01:11:22,503 --> 01:11:24,102
Don't trust him too much.

1938
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:25,212
(Kwang Soo is not credible.)

1939
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:27,212
(Haha is first to be out. He goes to prison.)

1940
01:11:27,213 --> 01:11:29,767
It's been a while since I've gone to prison so early.

1941
01:11:29,982 --> 01:11:32,074
What does Jae Seok get out of this?

1942
01:11:32,152 --> 01:11:33,252
Just for 10 dollars?

1943
01:11:33,253 --> 01:11:35,343
(I only had 10 dollars.)

1944
01:11:35,683 --> 01:11:37,238
You have 10 more dollars now.

1945
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:38,951
Is it 10 dollars?

1946
01:11:38,952 --> 01:11:41,462
(Haha had 10 dollars?)

1947
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,991
- Sorry? - Do I only get 10 dollars?

1948
01:11:42,992 --> 01:11:44,074
Yes.

1949
01:11:44,332 --> 01:11:45,675
That's so little.

1950
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:48,002
You have 10 more dollars,

1951
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,781
- so you have minus 80 now. - Why?

1952
01:11:50,032 --> 01:11:52,871
What? You spent 90 dollars to get 10.

1953
01:11:52,872 --> 01:11:54,472
(Can't you do the math?)

1954
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:55,957
You have minus 80.

1955
01:11:56,773 --> 01:11:57,954
Goodness.

1956
01:11:58,542 --> 01:11:59,956
This punk.

1957
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:02,281
- Thank you. - You...

1958
01:12:02,282 --> 01:12:04,374
- I will... - No, Jae Seok.

1959
01:12:04,513 --> 01:12:05,593
Thank you.

1960
01:12:06,013 --> 01:12:07,295
Oh, gosh.

1961
01:12:08,053 --> 01:12:11,053
The only way to survive is to get more money.

1962
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,052
(He doesn't have a lot of money, so he has to go there.)

1963
01:12:14,053 --> 01:12:15,375
I have to make more money.

1964
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:18,606
The shirt...

1965
01:12:18,662 --> 01:12:20,884
- If you untie this... - Kwang Soo, aren't you a target?

1966
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,584
- You're a target. - Not anymore.

1967
01:12:23,603 --> 01:12:24,701
- Why? - He's not a target anymore.

1968
01:12:24,702 --> 01:12:27,031
Haha bought him, and Haha is out.

1969
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:29,371
(Haha is out, so Kwang Soo is free again.)

1970
01:12:29,372 --> 01:12:30,371
(What's going on?)

1971
01:12:30,372 --> 01:12:31,422
What is this?

1972
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:33,157
- It's the pawnshop. - What do we do?

1973
01:12:33,273 --> 01:12:36,481
They measure whatever you have...

1974
01:12:36,482 --> 01:12:37,867
- and give you money. - The length.

1975
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:40,671
(The longer, the better?)

1976
01:12:43,023 --> 01:12:44,151
(I have a 120cm-long belt.)

1977
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:45,365
Kwang Soo, your belt.

1978
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:47,522
You can't. Do belts work?

1979
01:12:47,523 --> 01:12:49,522
I don't have a belt today.

1980
01:12:49,523 --> 01:12:50,592
(With this belt, Kwang Soo can become a millionaire.)

1981
01:12:50,593 --> 01:12:52,262
(I have none.)

1982
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:53,647
Belt.

1983
01:12:54,263 --> 01:12:55,302
(My belt is an anaconda.)

1984
01:12:55,303 --> 01:12:57,062
- This can't. - You can't.

1985
01:12:57,063 --> 01:12:58,587
This doesn't make sense.

1986
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:00,586
- 100 dollars. - This?

1987
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,088
What... What's going on?

1988
01:13:03,173 --> 01:13:04,253
This?

1989
01:13:05,143 --> 01:13:06,241
(He steals the belt.)

1990
01:13:06,242 --> 01:13:07,626
What... What's going on?

1991
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:09,657
What is he doing? Hey!

1992
01:13:10,082 --> 01:13:11,182
Hold on!

1993
01:13:11,183 --> 01:13:14,041
(Catch that thief!)

1994
01:13:19,393 --> 01:13:23,922
(His pants go down.)

1995
01:13:23,923 --> 01:13:26,923
(Give me my belt back!)

1996
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:29,062
(He runs at full speed...)

1997
01:13:29,063 --> 01:13:32,204
(and feels free.)

1998
01:13:32,332 --> 01:13:36,716
(As his speed picks up, his pants go down more.)

1999
01:13:37,273 --> 01:13:41,625
(Sobbing)

2000
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:46,119
(At 34, he's holding onto his underwear and sprinting.)

2001
01:13:48,822 --> 01:13:52,422
(If he doesn't give up and keeps running,)

2002
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:55,523
(his pants fall down.)

2003
01:13:56,023 --> 01:13:58,183
(How indecent.)

2004
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:03,470
(I want to go home early.)

2005
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,972
(Thief Jae Seok tries to sell the stolen belt.)

2006
01:14:05,973 --> 01:14:07,002
Excuse me.

2007
01:14:07,003 --> 01:14:08,842
(Thief Jae Seok tries to sell the stolen belt.)

2008
01:14:08,843 --> 01:14:11,338
(Please make it fast.)

2009
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:14,064
- It's 100 dollars. - I'll take that.

2010
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:16,541
- How much? 100 dollars? - 100 dollars?

2011
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:18,068
Did you sell it?

2012
01:14:18,652 --> 01:14:20,027
Kwang Soo is coming.

2013
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:24,623
(You have to invest like Jae Seok does.)

2014
01:14:25,992 --> 01:14:28,121
(He's in a hurry.)

2015
01:14:28,122 --> 01:14:29,121
Where's my belt?

2016
01:14:29,122 --> 01:14:30,304
- Did he sell it? - He did.

2017
01:14:30,822 --> 01:14:32,592
He sold it for 100 dollars.

2018
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:33,946
- He sold it? - It's over.

2019
01:14:34,063 --> 01:14:35,401
- Can he buy it back? - Yes.

2020
01:14:35,402 --> 01:14:36,661
- For how much? - 130 dollars.

2021
01:14:36,662 --> 01:14:39,663
(It's 130 dollars to buy it back.)

2022
01:14:39,902 --> 01:14:42,871
(There's a 30-dollar margin.)

2023
01:14:42,872 --> 01:14:44,256
Give me my belt back.

2024
01:14:44,843 --> 01:14:47,135
- 30 dollars? - He doesn't have that money.

2025
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:49,028
It's the market value.

2026
01:14:49,213 --> 01:14:50,757
He doesn't have money.

2027
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,911
There's interest.

2028
01:14:52,912 --> 01:14:54,981
My stylist got the sponsorship. Give it back.

2029
01:14:54,982 --> 01:14:57,174
(My stylist got the sponsorship. Give it back.)

2030
01:14:57,553 --> 01:14:59,168
Where's Roi Ha?

2031
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:01,361
(Se Chan, who bought Roi Ha, looks for him.)

2032
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:02,474
Roi Ha.

2033
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:04,174
Where's Roi Ha?

2034
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,861
(Where did our rock star hide?)

2035
01:15:05,862 --> 01:15:07,044
Where's Roi Ha?

2036
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:12,602
(He's watching from a corner of the building.)

2037
01:15:12,603 --> 01:15:16,037
(Who bought me?)

2038
01:15:16,143 --> 01:15:17,571
He's not here. I can't find him.

2039
01:15:17,572 --> 01:15:19,342
(There's no time, and his target is nowhere to be seen.)

2040
01:15:19,343 --> 01:15:21,099
15 minutes have passed.

2041
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,536
- What? It has? - 15 minutes have passed.

2042
01:15:24,042 --> 01:15:28,882
- A new target is Yang Se Chan. - Me?

2043
01:15:28,883 --> 01:15:30,670
(Am I the new target?)

2044
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:33,491
(Out Dot Com Auction House becomes busy once more.)

2045
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:34,661
Se Chan?

2046
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:36,462
(Out Dot Com Auction House becomes busy once more.)

2047
01:15:36,463 --> 01:15:37,846
Place your bid.

2048
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:40,132
It's impossible to remove Se Chan's name tag.

2049
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:41,661
Se Chan?

2050
01:15:41,662 --> 01:15:43,231
As for Se Chan... Hold on.

2051
01:15:43,232 --> 01:15:44,502
How much did you bid on me?

2052
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:45,802
(He sounds her out.)

2053
01:15:45,803 --> 01:15:47,893
Me? I bid 10 dollars.

2054
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:50,262
I only have a small sum of money.

2055
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:51,787
- What? - I only have a small sum of money.

2056
01:15:52,313 --> 01:15:53,323
I bid 10 dollars.

2057
01:15:53,572 --> 01:15:55,461
You won't make the winning bid with 10 dollars.

2058
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:57,294
I only have 10 dollars.

2059
01:15:58,152 --> 01:15:59,495
Why are you following me?

2060
01:15:59,713 --> 01:16:00,895
I bid 10 dollars.

2061
01:16:02,253 --> 01:16:03,382
For goodness' sake.

2062
01:16:03,383 --> 01:16:04,522
(She latches onto Se Chan before the bid closes.)

2063
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:07,320
- Wait for me. - Why are you following me?

2064
01:16:07,353 --> 01:16:10,022
I think it will be fun to stay with you.

2065
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,224
You want to rip my name tag off after the bid closes, right?

2066
01:16:14,232 --> 01:16:17,231
I think I will win. I think I am stronger than you.

2067
01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:18,888
You underestimated me. Okay.

2068
01:16:19,433 --> 01:16:20,745
That's why you want to follow me around.

2069
01:16:21,173 --> 01:16:23,041
I am clingy.

2070
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,254
I see.

2071
01:16:24,612 --> 01:16:26,734
The bid has closed.

2072
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:29,241
The bid has closed.

2073
01:16:29,242 --> 01:16:33,012
Yang Se Chan was sold for 32 dollars.

2074
01:16:33,013 --> 01:16:34,481
- Really? - 32 dollars?

2075
01:16:34,482 --> 01:16:35,633
Really?

2076
01:16:36,122 --> 01:16:37,465
32 dollars?

2077
01:16:39,023 --> 01:16:40,252
Hold on.

2078
01:16:40,253 --> 01:16:42,861
(I think she made the winning bid.)

2079
01:16:42,862 --> 01:16:44,175
This is hilarious.

2080
01:16:44,263 --> 01:16:45,545
Hyo Rim, please!

2081
01:16:47,032 --> 01:16:49,831
(Se Chan, wait for me.)

2082
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:51,102
Hyo Rim!

2083
01:16:51,103 --> 01:16:55,842
(Se Chan uses his strong thighs to outrun Hyo Rim.)

2084
01:16:55,843 --> 01:16:57,611
He is really fast.

2085
01:16:57,612 --> 01:16:59,672
(It looks like I lost Se Chan.)

2086
01:16:59,673 --> 01:17:00,784
I am exhausted.

2087
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:03,740
(I am glad I gave her the slip.)

2088
01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:05,623
What?

2089
01:17:05,782 --> 01:17:07,268
- Gosh, you startled me. - You startled me.

2090
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:09,673
You startled me, Si Yang.

2091
01:17:10,082 --> 01:17:13,486
(He runs into Si Yang who was wandering aimlessly.)

2092
01:17:13,822 --> 01:17:14,892
Se Chan.

2093
01:17:14,893 --> 01:17:16,092
My goodness.

2094
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:17,691
Where is the pawnshop?

2095
01:17:17,692 --> 01:17:19,262
- You need to find it. - Really?

2096
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:21,031
(It's strange because he was at the pawnshop.)

2097
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:22,416
- Who? - So Min.

2098
01:17:23,202 --> 01:17:24,242
What is going on?

2099
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:27,526
(He rips Se Chan's name tag.)

2100
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:31,552
(Si Yang rips Se Chan's name tag. What is going on?)

2101
01:17:31,942 --> 01:17:34,382
(The person who won the bid with 32 dollars is...)

2102
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,837
(Si Yang.)

2103
01:17:37,213 --> 01:17:40,818
(That's enough for Se Chan.)

2104
01:17:41,122 --> 01:17:44,152
(Okay. It looks like I won the bid.)

2105
01:17:44,792 --> 01:17:47,519
(Let's go and get Se Chan.)

2106
01:17:49,162 --> 01:17:50,661
Why are you limping?

2107
01:17:50,662 --> 01:17:51,661
(He meets Hyo Rim after she loses Se Chan.)

2108
01:17:51,662 --> 01:17:54,462
- I was chasing after Se Chan. - Se Chan? Where is he?

2109
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:56,150
- I lost him. - Where is he?

2110
01:17:56,202 --> 01:17:57,789
He went to the annex.

2111
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,901
(After he gains information, he starts the chase.)

2112
01:18:01,072 --> 01:18:04,244
(It's hard to understand why Hyo Rim ran.)

2113
01:18:05,912 --> 01:18:06,984
What was that?

2114
01:18:07,273 --> 01:18:08,281
(Give me your belongings.)

2115
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:10,162
What is going on?

2116
01:18:11,053 --> 01:18:12,611
(Let me sell your things since you're out.)

2117
01:18:12,612 --> 01:18:13,965
Why are you taking those? Hold on.

2118
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:16,451
Why are you taking those?

2119
01:18:16,452 --> 01:18:18,352
(Isn't Hyo Rim the highest bidder?)

2120
01:18:18,353 --> 01:18:19,434
What?

2121
01:18:20,523 --> 01:18:22,380
What is going on? Am I out?

2122
01:18:23,822 --> 01:18:24,974
What is this?

2123
01:18:25,593 --> 01:18:27,309
Aren't you going to tell me anything?

2124
01:18:27,862 --> 01:18:30,302
(Since Se Chan is out, Roi Ha is no longer a target.)

2125
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:31,901
Here is Se Chan's name tag.

2126
01:18:31,902 --> 01:18:33,831
(Si Yang, the robber, heads straight to the pawnshop.)

2127
01:18:33,832 --> 01:18:34,972
30, 30, and 20cm. 80 dollars.

2128
01:18:34,973 --> 01:18:36,401
(He acquires 80 dollars.)

2129
01:18:36,402 --> 01:18:38,129
80 dollars. Thank you.

2130
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,571
Sit down, 32 Dollars.

2131
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:42,512
(Meanwhile, Haha and Se Chan are in prison.)

2132
01:18:42,513 --> 01:18:43,795
You were sold at 32 dollars, right?

2133
01:18:44,013 --> 01:18:46,411
- Was it 33 dollars? - 32 dollars.

2134
01:18:46,412 --> 01:18:47,594
Go and sit over there.

2135
01:18:47,883 --> 01:18:49,281
- How much was the winning bid? - 90 dollars.

2136
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:50,535
Sir, I'll sit over there.

2137
01:18:51,122 --> 01:18:53,042
For me, the winning bid was 32 dollars.

2138
01:18:54,322 --> 01:18:55,909
Come over here.

2139
01:18:56,223 --> 01:18:57,676
Eat some sweets.

2140
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:00,756
Jae Seok had no reason to place a bid on me.

2141
01:19:01,732 --> 01:19:02,814
What do you mean?

2142
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:05,191
Are you still upset your name tag got ripped?

2143
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:08,431
He had no reason. Would you spend 90 dollars for 10 dollars?

2144
01:19:09,103 --> 01:19:10,890
What a weasel.

2145
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,030
- That's funny. - He did it for fun.

2146
01:19:13,112 --> 01:19:14,830
He did it for 10 dollars.

2147
01:19:16,643 --> 01:19:18,703
He must live a boring life at home.

2148
01:19:20,183 --> 01:19:24,222
(Meanwhile, the man who leads a boring life at home...)

2149
01:19:24,223 --> 01:19:25,940
Hold on. What is this?

2150
01:19:27,423 --> 01:19:28,861
What's "Make a call"?

2151
01:19:28,862 --> 01:19:30,277
(Make a call.)

2152
01:19:31,192 --> 01:19:33,392
(When Haha got eliminated,)

2153
01:19:33,393 --> 01:19:39,534
(Jae Seok found a message card on his back.)

2154
01:19:41,603 --> 01:19:43,694
(I should hide it and look at it by myself.)

2155
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:47,212
(What is the message card that reads "Make a call"...)

2156
01:19:47,213 --> 01:19:48,512
(that was attached to Haha's name tag?)

2157
01:19:48,513 --> 01:19:50,481
I can't believe this happened.

2158
01:19:50,482 --> 01:19:55,027
(He calls the headquarters of Out Dot Com.)

2159
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:59,151
Out Dot Com Race has an architect and an assistant.

2160
01:19:59,152 --> 01:20:00,222
Excuse me?

2161
01:20:00,223 --> 01:20:03,661
(An architect and an assistant are among us?)

2162
01:20:03,662 --> 01:20:07,501
(An architect and an assistant)

2163
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,102
An assistant?

2164
01:20:09,103 --> 01:20:11,371
(Si Yang acquires the same piece of information.)

2165
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:13,632
The architect knows how much money...

2166
01:20:13,633 --> 01:20:15,623
every member has or bid.

2167
01:20:16,003 --> 01:20:18,012
If you find the architect and rip off their name tag,

2168
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:19,241
you win immediately.

2169
01:20:19,242 --> 01:20:20,812
(If you eliminate the architect, you win.)

2170
01:20:20,813 --> 01:20:21,812
Architect?

2171
01:20:21,813 --> 01:20:22,981
(You don't have to eliminate everyone to win.)

2172
01:20:22,982 --> 01:20:26,111
The architect has a brother.

2173
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,597
(Those who eliminated others received a hint.)

2174
01:20:28,082 --> 01:20:29,752
(Hyo Rim, So Min, Roi Ha, Seok Jin,)

2175
01:20:29,753 --> 01:20:32,191
(Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo all have a brother.)

2176
01:20:32,192 --> 01:20:33,252
Okay.

2177
01:20:33,253 --> 01:20:36,121
The architect is in their 30s.

2178
01:20:36,122 --> 01:20:37,546
(Si Yang receives a different hint.)

2179
01:20:38,263 --> 01:20:39,878
(Among them, those who are in their 30s are...)

2180
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:43,162
(Hyo Rim, So Min, and Ji Hyo.)

2181
01:20:44,133 --> 01:20:47,502
(So I win if I eliminate the architect.)

2182
01:20:47,503 --> 01:20:49,901
What is going on? Who is the architect?

2183
01:20:49,902 --> 01:20:51,024
(What is going on?)

2184
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,312
(The architect and the assistant know everything about us.)

2185
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:56,012
For goodness' sake.

2186
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:57,456
(Who could they be?)

2187
01:20:58,613 --> 01:21:00,168
(Current Rankings)

2188
01:21:00,212 --> 01:21:02,070
(Hyo Rim, Ji Hyo, Jae Seok, Jong Kook, So Min, Seok Jin,)

2189
01:21:02,123 --> 01:21:03,193
(Si Yang, Kwang Soo, and Roi Ha)

2190
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:05,646
The new targets have been chosen.

2191
01:21:06,453 --> 01:21:08,815
The new targets are Kim Roi Ha,

2192
01:21:09,063 --> 01:21:11,446
Lee Kwang Soo, and Kwak Si Yang.

2193
01:21:11,823 --> 01:21:13,681
We will start the bidding.

2194
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:15,243
Hold on.

2195
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,281
We need to bid on all targets, right?

2196
01:21:18,363 --> 01:21:21,102
From now on, I won't aim for all the targets.

2197
01:21:21,103 --> 01:21:22,541
(Jae Seok has his eyes on the architect.)

2198
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:26,112
(He bids 40 dollars on Roi Ha, a man who has a brother.)

2199
01:21:26,113 --> 01:21:27,859
I bid 62 dollars on Kwang Soo.

2200
01:21:28,783 --> 01:21:29,841
62 dollars.

2201
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:32,004
I bid 51 dollars on Si Yang.

2202
01:21:32,552 --> 01:21:33,952
I bid 51 dollars on Roi Ha.

2203
01:21:33,953 --> 01:21:35,211
(She bids a specific sum of money.)

2204
01:21:35,212 --> 01:21:37,444
The bid has closed.

2205
01:21:37,623 --> 01:21:39,891
Kim Roi Ha is sold for 51 dollars.

2206
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:41,122
(So Min wins the bid for Roi Ha with 51 dollars.)

2207
01:21:41,123 --> 01:21:43,192
Kwak Si Yang is sold for 51 dollars.

2208
01:21:43,193 --> 01:21:44,791
(So Min wins the bid for Si Yang with 51 dollars as well.)

2209
01:21:44,792 --> 01:21:46,610
I will look for Roi Ha.

2210
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:48,347
I will rip off his name tag.

2211
01:21:48,592 --> 01:21:52,301
Lee Kwang Soo is sold for 62 dollars.

2212
01:21:52,302 --> 01:21:53,747
I won the bid for Kwang Soo.

2213
01:21:54,472 --> 01:21:55,801
(He doesn't know what to do.)

2214
01:21:55,802 --> 01:21:57,419
I won the bid for Kwang Soo.

2215
01:21:58,142 --> 01:21:59,526
I need to be hidden.

2216
01:22:00,172 --> 01:22:01,859
I need to hide for 15 minutes.

2217
01:22:03,082 --> 01:22:07,758
(The other targets avoid the mysterious bidders as well.)

2218
01:22:07,913 --> 01:22:09,468
For goodness' sake.

2219
01:22:09,783 --> 01:22:12,115
I need to find the architect.

2220
01:22:12,722 --> 01:22:13,732
Jae Seok.

2221
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,166
Okay.

2222
01:22:15,693 --> 01:22:16,975
Did you win the bid?

2223
01:22:17,392 --> 01:22:18,662
- What? - Did you win the bid?

2224
01:22:18,663 --> 01:22:20,192
- Help me. - Why?

2225
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:23,131
I won the bid, but I don't think I will be able to rip his name tag.

2226
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:25,732
- Whose name tag? - Kwang Soo's.

2227
01:22:25,733 --> 01:22:26,801
(His stamina doesn't match his passion.)

2228
01:22:26,802 --> 01:22:29,202
- It will be hard. - I know it will be hard.

2229
01:22:29,203 --> 01:22:30,471
It will be hard to eliminate him.

2230
01:22:30,472 --> 01:22:32,942
Look at my shoes.

2231
01:22:32,943 --> 01:22:35,942
- I need to buy my shoes back. - Give me 10 dollars if I help you.

2232
01:22:35,943 --> 01:22:37,412
Of course.

2233
01:22:37,413 --> 01:22:38,711
- 10 dollars from Kwang Soo? - Okay.

2234
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:41,409
- I will give you 10 dollars. - Let's split the profit by 6 to 4.

2235
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:43,022
- That leaves me with nothing. - You can take 60 percent.

2236
01:22:43,023 --> 01:22:45,022
I will take 40 percent.

2237
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:46,452
- How much does he have? - 6 to 4.

2238
01:22:46,453 --> 01:22:48,192
- How about 7 to 3? - Then I refuse to help.

2239
01:22:48,193 --> 01:22:49,261
(Come on.)

2240
01:22:49,262 --> 01:22:50,334
7 to 3.

2241
01:22:50,563 --> 01:22:51,976
I need to get something out of this.

2242
01:22:52,632 --> 01:22:53,992
- Okay. 6 to 4. - 6 to 4.

2243
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,301
How much does he have?

2244
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:57,402
- How much does he have? - He has a lot of money.

2245
01:22:57,403 --> 01:22:59,431
- Let's take the stairs. - Okay.

2246
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:02,231
(The allied, middle-aged men begin the search.)

2247
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:05,738
(Si Yang is running stealthily.)

2248
01:23:06,842 --> 01:23:08,072
Gosh, you startled me.

2249
01:23:08,073 --> 01:23:09,681
(I hear you are a target.)

2250
01:23:09,682 --> 01:23:12,751
(The tiger in front of the elevator startles him.)

2251
01:23:12,752 --> 01:23:13,965
Where are you going?

2252
01:23:14,283 --> 01:23:15,551
Where are you going?

2253
01:23:15,552 --> 01:23:17,581
Me? I am going to the pawnshop.

2254
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:19,269
- You were sold at 51 dollars. - Yes.

2255
01:23:19,623 --> 01:23:21,291
I was sold at 51 dollars.

2256
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:23,692
51 Dollars, shall we ride together? Are you going to the pawnshop?

2257
01:23:23,693 --> 01:23:25,237
- What? - Let's go together.

2258
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:27,232
My goodness.

2259
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:28,444
- Si Yang. - Yes?

2260
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:30,801
So you were sold at 51 dollars.

2261
01:23:30,802 --> 01:23:33,196
I am cheap like that.

2262
01:23:34,103 --> 01:23:37,071
Gosh, why is everyone here?

2263
01:23:37,273 --> 01:23:40,141
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo make a scary elevator ride.)

2264
01:23:40,142 --> 01:23:41,641
Did someone call me?

2265
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:42,956
- Excuse me. - Where are you going?

2266
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:45,141
Excuse me.

2267
01:23:45,142 --> 01:23:46,830
- Are you going to come in? - What?

2268
01:23:46,953 --> 01:23:48,312
No.

2269
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:50,545
(While the fake highest bidders trap Si Yang,)

2270
01:23:50,623 --> 01:23:52,322
(the real highest bidder, So Min, appears.)

2271
01:23:52,323 --> 01:23:54,221
What is wrong with you?

2272
01:23:54,222 --> 01:23:55,822
What is wrong with you?

2273
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:58,520
(He runs away.)

2274
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,631
It's Si Yang.

2275
01:23:59,632 --> 01:24:01,431
(Wait right there, 51 Dollars.)

2276
01:24:01,432 --> 01:24:03,102
So Min should have said something.

2277
01:24:03,103 --> 01:24:05,396
- Why? - Then we would have held him.

2278
01:24:06,103 --> 01:24:08,224
(Wait right there.)

2279
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:11,430
(Save me.)

2280
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:13,072
This is exhausting.

2281
01:24:13,073 --> 01:24:14,688
(How is he so fast?)

2282
01:24:15,012 --> 01:24:16,312
Which way should I go?

2283
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:18,362
(I lost her, right?)

2284
01:24:19,483 --> 01:24:20,593
So Min.

2285
01:24:21,552 --> 01:24:23,421
Did you win the bid for Roi Ha?

2286
01:24:23,422 --> 01:24:25,921
- It seems that way. - He is in the basement.

2287
01:24:25,922 --> 01:24:27,034
(Whispering)

2288
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:29,711
- Hurry. - Thank you, Jong Kook.

2289
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,022
Let's go.

2290
01:24:31,023 --> 01:24:32,232
(Let's go to the basement.)

2291
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,362
Roi Ha.

2292
01:24:33,363 --> 01:24:34,806
(She finds Roi Ha.)

2293
01:24:35,092 --> 01:24:36,214
What are you doing?

2294
01:24:36,403 --> 01:24:38,062
- It's not me. - Why are you carrying this?

2295
01:24:38,063 --> 01:24:39,772
I am going to sell it.

2296
01:24:39,773 --> 01:24:41,014
- You are going to sell it? - Yes.

2297
01:24:41,033 --> 01:24:42,891
You are sweating a lot.

2298
01:24:43,142 --> 01:24:46,172
Really? It must be because my blood sugar level is low.

2299
01:24:46,943 --> 01:24:48,742
- Did you go to the pawnshop? - What?

2300
01:24:48,743 --> 01:24:50,025
I did,

2301
01:24:50,512 --> 01:24:52,027
but I am still at the bottom.

2302
01:24:52,682 --> 01:24:54,066
- I will give this to you. - I'm still poor.

2303
01:24:55,012 --> 01:24:57,721
I will give this to you. Sell it.

2304
01:24:57,722 --> 01:24:59,692
(She gives him a squeaky hammer to lure him to the pawnshop.)

2305
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:00,803
Thank you.

2306
01:25:01,153 --> 01:25:02,421
- Can I sell this? - You never know.

2307
01:25:02,422 --> 01:25:05,250
Take it to the pawnshop.

2308
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:07,044
It's so hot.

2309
01:25:07,132 --> 01:25:10,362
It's so hot. Roi Ha, try selling it.

2310
01:25:10,363 --> 01:25:11,801
(The queen of fraud leaves.)

2311
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:14,298
(It's a strategy to make Roi Ha go to the pawnshop.)

2312
01:25:14,472 --> 01:25:16,694
What should I do?

2313
01:25:16,943 --> 01:25:18,620
I need to be behind him.

2314
01:25:19,943 --> 01:25:21,125
I should go.

2315
01:25:21,172 --> 01:25:24,172
(Let me go to the pawnshop to sell this.)

2316
01:25:26,712 --> 01:25:28,470
- I should sell a lot. - This isn't easy.

2317
01:25:30,783 --> 01:25:31,864
It's so hot.

2318
01:25:32,592 --> 01:25:33,591
I should go this way.

2319
01:25:33,592 --> 01:25:37,258
(So Min approaches Roi Ha pretending to go somewhere else.)

2320
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:40,414
(She moves in on him.)

2321
01:25:41,292 --> 01:25:43,384
(Grabbing)

2322
01:25:44,563 --> 01:25:45,872
(Ripping off)

2323
01:25:45,873 --> 01:25:48,471
Roi Ha, I'm sorry. He didn't even move.

2324
01:25:48,472 --> 01:25:49,471
- He didn't even move. - My gosh.

2325
01:25:49,472 --> 01:25:51,392
So Min must've gotten very rich.

2326
01:25:53,873 --> 01:25:55,762
Was this a bait for me?

2327
01:25:56,182 --> 01:25:57,282
Did I fall for that?

2328
01:25:57,283 --> 01:25:59,312
Did you fall for it? Did she fool you?

2329
01:25:59,313 --> 01:26:02,656
You didn't get up. That's why I gave this to you.

2330
01:26:03,052 --> 01:26:05,122
- My gosh. - It'd be a month later.

2331
01:26:05,123 --> 01:26:07,822
If he decides to hide,

2332
01:26:07,823 --> 01:26:10,062
- We can't find him in 15 minutes. - it'd be hard.

2333
01:26:10,063 --> 01:26:11,607
(Where did you hide, Kwang Soo?)

2334
01:26:13,332 --> 01:26:15,827
A new target has been chosen.

2335
01:26:16,432 --> 01:26:19,272
The new target is Jee Seok Jin.

2336
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:22,504
(15 minutes have passed.)

2337
01:26:22,943 --> 01:26:24,572
We will start the bidding.

2338
01:26:24,573 --> 01:26:25,755
(I'm the target now? This is bad.)

2339
01:26:26,373 --> 01:26:27,572
(He tries to make a bid for 80 dollars.)

2340
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:29,330
I spent 80 dollars on Seok Jin.

2341
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:32,812
- He's less than 100 dollars. - That's right.

2342
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:35,579
- Seok Jin... - The bid has closed.

2343
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:40,952
Jee Seok Jin is sold for 80 dollars...

2344
01:26:40,953 --> 01:26:43,062
- Really? - exclusively.

2345
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:44,662
- What's happening? - That's really expensive.

2346
01:26:44,663 --> 01:26:47,291
You'd lose money if you pay 80 dollars for him.

2347
01:26:47,292 --> 01:26:49,384
- Right. - You'd just waste your energy.

2348
01:26:49,563 --> 01:26:52,272
Jee Seok Jin is sold for 80 dollars to an exclusive bidder.

2349
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:53,616
(Okay! I won the bid for the weakest!)

2350
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:55,772
(Starting now, Kwang Soo and Seok Jin will target each other.)

2351
01:26:55,773 --> 01:26:57,924
I won the bid exclusively, right? Okay, I can go out now.

2352
01:26:58,773 --> 01:27:00,258
I just need to remove his name tag.

2353
01:27:00,943 --> 01:27:02,742
(At times like this, this person pops into his mind first.)

2354
01:27:02,743 --> 01:27:04,329
- Hello. - Jae Seok.

2355
01:27:04,382 --> 01:27:05,564
Did you make a bid for 80 dollars?

2356
01:27:06,552 --> 01:27:10,221
I sent you a text message.

2357
01:27:10,222 --> 01:27:11,221
(What is this con artist scheming?)

2358
01:27:11,222 --> 01:27:13,313
I read it. Why did you call me?

2359
01:27:14,193 --> 01:27:16,818
If you help me eliminate Seok Jin,

2360
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:19,685
I'll give you half on the spot right away.

2361
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,831
(He's tempted.)

2362
01:27:21,832 --> 01:27:24,862
- Are you serious? - I'll give it to you right away.

2363
01:27:25,672 --> 01:27:27,854
- I'm at the rooftop... - Okay.

2364
01:27:28,502 --> 01:27:31,242
of the building across from where we received the mission earlier.

2365
01:27:31,243 --> 01:27:33,541
- I got it. - Okay, see you, Jae Seok.

2366
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:34,541
(He'll get half.)

2367
01:27:34,542 --> 01:27:35,812
(As soon as he hangs up...)

2368
01:27:35,813 --> 01:27:37,112
He'll find a way.

2369
01:27:37,113 --> 01:27:39,312
- Seok Jin, where are you? - Jae Seok.

2370
01:27:39,313 --> 01:27:40,912
Who won the bid? Is that you?

2371
01:27:40,913 --> 01:27:41,952
(This trickster is busily making calls.)

2372
01:27:41,953 --> 01:27:43,235
You didn't win the bid, right?

2373
01:27:43,483 --> 01:27:45,251
- I'll be honest. - Okay.

2374
01:27:45,252 --> 01:27:47,041
Kwang Soo made the winning bid.

2375
01:27:47,422 --> 01:27:49,862
Kwang Soo said if I helped him eliminate you,

2376
01:27:49,863 --> 01:27:50,961
he'd give me half of it.

2377
01:27:50,962 --> 01:27:52,305
(What will you offer?)

2378
01:27:52,632 --> 01:27:54,761
Hey, if you eliminate Kwang Soo for me...

2379
01:27:54,762 --> 01:27:56,702
- Okay. - If you do that...

2380
01:27:56,703 --> 01:27:58,162
(Gosh, he will go 5 to 5 with you?)

2381
01:27:58,163 --> 01:27:59,671
It's 6 to 4. You'll take the larger amount.

2382
01:27:59,672 --> 01:28:01,272
(It's 6 to 4. You'll take the larger amount.)

2383
01:28:01,273 --> 01:28:02,671
I'll take the larger amount?

2384
01:28:02,672 --> 01:28:04,041
(He started with 4, but ends up with 6.)

2385
01:28:04,042 --> 01:28:06,567
You'll take 60 percent. I'll take 40, and you'll take 60.

2386
01:28:07,113 --> 01:28:08,372
Are you sure?

2387
01:28:08,373 --> 01:28:11,069
Yes. You take 60 percent.

2388
01:28:11,582 --> 01:28:12,581
7 to 3.

2389
01:28:12,582 --> 01:28:14,300
(Let's negotiate more since we're at it.)

2390
01:28:15,052 --> 01:28:17,452
(Gosh, don't you think that's too cruel?)

2391
01:28:17,453 --> 01:28:19,411
Seok Jin, it's a life-or-death situation for you.

2392
01:28:19,422 --> 01:28:22,290
- I can just go to Kwang Soo. - Okay, fine. Darn it.

2393
01:28:23,063 --> 01:28:24,862
- I accept. You take 70 percent. - Okay.

2394
01:28:24,863 --> 01:28:27,032
- You take 70 percent. I got it. - Okay, okay.

2395
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:29,032
- Okay. - I'll head over there.

2396
01:28:29,033 --> 01:28:30,850
(He's indeed the master of negotiation.)

2397
01:28:33,573 --> 01:28:35,372
Okay. This is the only way.

2398
01:28:35,373 --> 01:28:36,471
(Clueless of this, he waits for Jae Seok.)

2399
01:28:36,472 --> 01:28:38,017
This is my last hope.

2400
01:28:38,472 --> 01:28:40,866
- Did you negotiate with Kwang Soo? - Gosh.

2401
01:28:41,012 --> 01:28:43,381
- What? I get to take 70 percent. - He didn't offer you 80, right?

2402
01:28:43,382 --> 01:28:46,109
- I'd never, Seok Jin. - Okay.

2403
01:28:46,313 --> 01:28:48,751
A new target has been chosen.

2404
01:28:48,752 --> 01:28:51,051
(15 minutes has passed during negotiations.)

2405
01:28:51,052 --> 01:28:54,022
The new target is Yu Jae Seok.

2406
01:28:54,153 --> 01:28:55,577
Who?

2407
01:28:56,422 --> 01:28:58,280
- Jae Seok. Hey, Jae Seok. - Hold on.

2408
01:28:58,323 --> 01:28:59,807
This can't be happening.

2409
01:29:00,462 --> 01:29:03,027
- I'll protect you. What? - Someone made a bid.

2410
01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:05,331
He made a bid for 130 dollars.

2411
01:29:05,332 --> 01:29:06,501
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

2412
01:29:06,502 --> 01:29:07,643
130 dollars?

2413
01:29:07,932 --> 01:29:10,602
(Kwang Soo was sending the bid to the headquarters.)

2414
01:29:10,603 --> 01:29:13,976
I sent this to Jae Seok. I made a mistake of sending it to him.

2415
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:17,442
(He sent Jae Seok the text which was meant for the headquarters.)

2416
01:29:17,443 --> 01:29:19,482
Kwang Soo made a bid for 130 dollars.

2417
01:29:19,483 --> 01:29:21,812
- What a traitor. - Let's go catch him.

2418
01:29:21,813 --> 01:29:25,152
- Let's get him. I can't waste time. - Let's go. Let's not waste time.

2419
01:29:25,153 --> 01:29:26,435
(How dare you? We're on our way to get you!)

2420
01:29:28,023 --> 01:29:32,436
(I'm doomed. Jae Seok knows where I am.)

2421
01:29:33,832 --> 01:29:36,832
Is this it? I see. He must be hiding here.

2422
01:29:37,063 --> 01:29:40,163
- This is the place. - It's here. He's behind the door.

2423
01:29:40,672 --> 01:29:42,087
Kwang Soo.

2424
01:29:45,342 --> 01:29:47,564
- Hey. - Did you buy me or not?

2425
01:29:47,573 --> 01:29:48,812
- You? - You didn't, right?

2426
01:29:48,813 --> 01:29:50,011
I don't have money.

2427
01:29:50,012 --> 01:29:52,709
Hey, you. Why did you send me the text with the bidding price?

2428
01:29:55,323 --> 01:29:56,852
Did you make the bid to me?

2429
01:29:56,853 --> 01:29:59,550
Did you send it to me instead of to the headquarters by accident?

2430
01:29:59,922 --> 01:30:02,084
- What happened was... - Is that it?

2431
01:30:02,462 --> 01:30:04,062
(Let's just pounce on my target, Seok Jin.)

2432
01:30:04,063 --> 01:30:05,073
Wait.

2433
01:30:05,592 --> 01:30:08,259
(I don't know anymore. Give me your name tag!)

2434
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:10,431
Get the name tag now.

2435
01:30:10,432 --> 01:30:13,736
(Jae Seok holds Kwang Soo, and Seok Jin tries to remove it.)

2436
01:30:14,233 --> 01:30:15,471
(Ripping off)

2437
01:30:15,472 --> 01:30:19,211
(By a close call, Seok Jin arrests the con artist, Kwang Soo.)

2438
01:30:19,212 --> 01:30:20,284
I got it.

2439
01:30:21,743 --> 01:30:22,742
I got it first.

2440
01:30:22,743 --> 01:30:23,782
(Both of them are exhausted.)

2441
01:30:23,783 --> 01:30:25,412
- Seok Jin was slightly faster. - I was slightly faster.

2442
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:26,852
- Was he faster? - Yes.

2443
01:30:26,853 --> 01:30:28,952
(This is all because of that mistake of mine.)

2444
01:30:28,953 --> 01:30:31,578
Hey, you. Do you think you can call yourself a human being?

2445
01:30:31,953 --> 01:30:34,322
How dare you buy me for 130 dollars?

2446
01:30:34,323 --> 01:30:36,888
- Seriously? Hey. - Listen, Jae Seok.

2447
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:39,007
Hey, what is this? "Make a call."

2448
01:30:39,563 --> 01:30:41,291
- What? - What is this?

2449
01:30:41,292 --> 01:30:43,232
(Seok Jin finds a phone call hint about the architect.)

2450
01:30:43,233 --> 01:30:45,331
Hey, we have to make a call. Kwang Soo.

2451
01:30:45,332 --> 01:30:46,872
This race isn't everything today.

2452
01:30:46,873 --> 01:30:48,316
(Seok Jin finds a phone call hint about the architect.)

2453
01:30:48,703 --> 01:30:50,202
There's an architect.

2454
01:30:50,203 --> 01:30:52,572
(Seok Jin is listening to the hint about the architect.)

2455
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:57,412
(So Min, Ji Hyo, and Hyo Rim are the possible candidates.)

2456
01:30:57,413 --> 01:31:00,847
- The architect's name is real. - Thank you.

2457
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:07,099
(The architect uses her real name? That means...)

2458
01:31:07,323 --> 01:31:09,615
(the architect is either So Min or Hyo Rim.)

2459
01:31:11,023 --> 01:31:12,103
What's that noise?

2460
01:31:12,292 --> 01:31:14,989
A new target has been chosen.

2461
01:31:15,663 --> 01:31:17,147
The new target is...

2462
01:31:17,302 --> 01:31:18,576
Jee Seok Jin.

2463
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,793
(It's me again?)

2464
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:24,876
(Seok Jin is a regular target of the members.)

2465
01:31:26,873 --> 01:31:28,942
Listen. Are you doing this on purpose?

2466
01:31:28,943 --> 01:31:31,306
- Why is it always me? - Why does it keep happening to him?

2467
01:31:31,542 --> 01:31:32,751
(Current Rankings)

2468
01:31:32,752 --> 01:31:34,251
(So Min, Hyo Rim, Ji Hyo, Jong Kook,)

2469
01:31:34,252 --> 01:31:35,939
(Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Si Yang.)

2470
01:31:35,953 --> 01:31:38,103
The bid has closed.

2471
01:31:38,922 --> 01:31:45,391
Jee Seok Jin is sold for 200 dollars exclusively.

2472
01:31:45,392 --> 01:31:46,761
(That's the highest bid.)

2473
01:31:46,762 --> 01:31:49,732
200 dollars? Jong Kook, did you make the bid?

2474
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:52,032
- No. - Jong Kook. 200 dollars?

2475
01:31:52,033 --> 01:31:54,471
No, I didn't. Here's what I think.

2476
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:55,614
It's So Min.

2477
01:31:56,342 --> 01:31:58,711
(Did So Min, who's in first place, win the bid with 200 dollars?)

2478
01:31:58,712 --> 01:31:59,711
Should I hide in here?

2479
01:31:59,712 --> 01:32:03,985
(Seok Jin, the target, is on the run for now.)

2480
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:06,452
(He rushes into the wardrobe department, a perfect hiding spot.)

2481
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:07,551
Come in.

2482
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,239
(He rushes into the wardrobe department, a perfect hiding spot.)

2483
01:32:09,682 --> 01:32:12,852
Seok Jin. It's So Min. I think it's So Min.

2484
01:32:12,853 --> 01:32:16,562
- Hey. - So Min... She made...

2485
01:32:16,563 --> 01:32:19,662
- the bids for you and Jae Seok. - Exactly.

2486
01:32:19,663 --> 01:32:22,693
(Is So Min really the winning bidder for Seok Jin?)

2487
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:25,931
- Really? - I saw her bidding.

2488
01:32:25,932 --> 01:32:26,931
So Min...

2489
01:32:26,932 --> 01:32:29,194
(Grabbing)

2490
01:32:30,403 --> 01:32:31,402
I got it!

2491
01:32:31,403 --> 01:32:33,341
(Hyo Rim eliminates Seok Jin. What on earth happened here?)

2492
01:32:33,342 --> 01:32:36,746
Nice! Nice!

2493
01:32:37,983 --> 01:32:41,152
(A while ago, making a bid for Seok Jin)

2494
01:32:41,153 --> 01:32:44,322
(Hyo Rim made a bid on Seok Jin for 200 dollars, a high price.)

2495
01:32:44,323 --> 01:32:48,761
(She approached Seok Jin, hiding the fact that she won the bid.)

2496
01:32:48,762 --> 01:32:49,961
I'm sorry.

2497
01:32:49,962 --> 01:32:52,185
(Her plan was a big success. Thank you, Seok Jin.)

2498
01:32:53,163 --> 01:32:57,708
(She fooled everyone. Is Suspicious Hyo Rim the architect?)

2499
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,402
(Meanwhile, So Min is another possible architect.)

2500
01:33:00,403 --> 01:33:02,971
Where is Jae Seok? Did you see Jae Seok?

2501
01:33:02,972 --> 01:33:04,720
(Why is she looking for Jae Seok?)

2502
01:33:05,542 --> 01:33:08,572
(When it was time to bid for Jae Seok...)

2503
01:33:08,573 --> 01:33:10,835
(What should I do with Jae Seok?)

2504
01:33:11,682 --> 01:33:17,381
(So Min won the bid on Jae Seok with 156 dollars.)

2505
01:33:17,382 --> 01:33:23,482
(I won the bid. Okay, should I go find Jae Seok?)

2506
01:33:24,292 --> 01:33:26,032
(So Min was the winning bidder by a close call.)

2507
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:27,732
He's so weak.

2508
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:29,420
(So Min was the winning bidder by a close call.)

2509
01:33:29,432 --> 01:33:32,704
I'm so excited. My acting was perfect.

2510
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:36,808
(Which one is the architect?)

2511
01:33:37,472 --> 01:33:40,199
A new target has been chosen.

2512
01:33:40,813 --> 01:33:43,944
The new target is Seo Hyo Rim.

2513
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,751
(Who will win the bid on Hyo Rim who is possibly an architect?)

2514
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:49,822
We will start the bidding.

2515
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:50,863
(Who will win the bid on Hyo Rim, who is possibly an architect?)

2516
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:56,761
(Ji Hyo goes all-in with a bid of 440 dollars.)

2517
01:33:56,762 --> 01:33:58,692
The bid has closed.

2518
01:33:58,693 --> 01:34:01,723
Seo Hyo Rim is sold for 440 dollars...

2519
01:34:02,063 --> 01:34:04,831
- to an exclusive bidder. - Let's go.

2520
01:34:04,832 --> 01:34:07,498
I spent 200 dollars on Seok Jin for no reason.

2521
01:34:07,672 --> 01:34:09,187
I should've spent 150 dollars.

2522
01:34:09,842 --> 01:34:12,641
(Here's comes the winning bidder. Wait for me, Hyo Rim.)

2523
01:34:13,142 --> 01:34:17,687
(She's being pursued by Ji Hyo. What will happen to her?)

2524
01:34:18,182 --> 01:34:20,412
(Here you are, Hyo Rim.)

2525
01:34:20,413 --> 01:34:22,675
You're here.

2526
01:34:23,252 --> 01:34:25,952
- Wait. - Hyo Rim.

2527
01:34:25,953 --> 01:34:28,761
(If Hyo Rim is the architect and Ji Hyo eliminates her, Ji Hyo wins.)

2528
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:30,192
- Come here. - Ji Hyo.

2529
01:34:30,193 --> 01:34:33,061
(Come here, Hyo Rim.)

2530
01:34:34,363 --> 01:34:35,362
(She easily gets ahold of Hyo Rim.)

2531
01:34:35,363 --> 01:34:37,483
- I have no choice. - No!

2532
01:34:37,733 --> 01:34:39,072
No!

2533
01:34:39,073 --> 01:34:40,971
(She slowly rips off the name tag.)

2534
01:34:40,972 --> 01:34:45,659
(If she's the architect, there must be a mark for the architect.)

2535
01:34:46,373 --> 01:34:47,541
(Ripping off)

2536
01:34:47,542 --> 01:34:49,341
(She removes her name tag.)

2537
01:34:49,342 --> 01:34:52,282
(What's Hyo Rim's identity?)

2538
01:34:52,283 --> 01:34:53,424
I'm really sorry.

2539
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:57,552
- Well done. - We should check the hint.

2540
01:34:58,853 --> 01:35:00,692
(Hyo Rim isn't the architect.)

2541
01:35:00,693 --> 01:35:04,492
(Then the real architect is...)

2542
01:35:04,493 --> 01:35:07,594
(Jeon So Min.)

2543
01:35:09,502 --> 01:35:12,027
Hello. Hi.

2544
01:35:12,302 --> 01:35:15,303
(The architect of the website, Out Dot Com)

2545
01:35:15,472 --> 01:35:17,402
Just like the name, Out Dot Com is a website.

2546
01:35:17,403 --> 01:35:20,171
Whoever ends up on the site must be eliminated,

2547
01:35:20,172 --> 01:35:23,242
and if you're the last, surviving member, you will win the race.

2548
01:35:23,712 --> 01:35:27,782
So Min, you're the architect of this website.

2549
01:35:27,783 --> 01:35:29,181
- I'm the architect? - Yes.

2550
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:32,221
You must eliminate everyone and become the last one standing.

2551
01:35:32,222 --> 01:35:33,251
(This is the architect's mission.)

2552
01:35:33,252 --> 01:35:34,421
Wait, but...

2553
01:35:34,422 --> 01:35:36,987
(The day has finally come! She's elated.)

2554
01:35:37,262 --> 01:35:38,374
50 dollars on Si Yang.

2555
01:35:38,493 --> 01:35:40,391
51 dollars on Si Yang.

2556
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:41,732
(As the architect's privilege, she knew everyone's bids.)

2557
01:35:41,733 --> 01:35:42,862
50 dollars on Roi Ha.

2558
01:35:42,863 --> 01:35:43,961
(She could win the bid by a close call based on the info.)

2559
01:35:43,962 --> 01:35:45,162
51 dollars on Roi Ha as well.

2560
01:35:45,163 --> 01:35:46,385
(She could win the bid by a close call based on the info.)

2561
01:35:47,233 --> 01:35:52,742
(Thanks to her privilege, she could eliminate other members.)

2562
01:35:52,743 --> 01:35:58,438
(The architect of the website, Jeon So Min)

2563
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:01,576
A new target has been chosen.

2564
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:02,996
The new target is...

2565
01:36:03,153 --> 01:36:04,668
- Kim Jong Kook. - What?

2566
01:36:05,153 --> 01:36:07,152
We will start the bidding.

2567
01:36:07,153 --> 01:36:08,152
(Jong Kook is the target?)

2568
01:36:08,153 --> 01:36:10,990
The new target is Kim Jong Kook.

2569
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:14,862
(Has he become a target too? This capable man is in a crisis.)

2570
01:36:14,863 --> 01:36:16,102
I have to get him.

2571
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:18,001
(Here's a lady who is gunning for Jong Kook.)

2572
01:36:18,002 --> 01:36:21,407
(She goes all-in with 440 dollars.)

2573
01:36:22,342 --> 01:36:26,887
("Ji Hyo spent 440 dollars on him." The architect checks the bid.)

2574
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:31,017
(How much will So Min spend on him?)

2575
01:36:31,243 --> 01:36:33,374
The bid has closed.

2576
01:36:34,052 --> 01:36:36,881
Kim Jong Kook is sold for...

2577
01:36:37,882 --> 01:36:39,266
44...

2578
01:36:40,153 --> 01:36:41,263
445 dollars.

2579
01:36:42,623 --> 01:36:46,532
Kim Jong Kook is sold for 445 dollars to an exclusive bidder.

2580
01:36:47,993 --> 01:36:49,143
Who outbid me by five bucks?

2581
01:36:49,962 --> 01:36:51,074
What?

2582
01:36:51,403 --> 01:36:53,018
How could they have so much money?

2583
01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:57,575
(That's me! I'm the architect.)

2584
01:36:59,873 --> 01:37:03,417
(At that time, the target, Jong Kook, shows up.)

2585
01:37:05,182 --> 01:37:07,273
Did you get it? Did you win the bid?

2586
01:37:10,153 --> 01:37:12,243
I'm happy. I really am,

2587
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:16,499
but I've never eliminated someone.

2588
01:37:16,722 --> 01:37:19,662
That's why we have invited...

2589
01:37:19,663 --> 01:37:21,955
a strong assistant who will help you today.

2590
01:37:22,403 --> 01:37:26,631
(A strong assistant that will help me remove the name tags?)

2591
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:28,118
- Is it a guy? - We'll bring the assistant in.

2592
01:37:29,672 --> 01:37:32,772
(Is Jong Kook her assistant that will help So Min, the architect?)

2593
01:37:32,773 --> 01:37:36,211
(Right. From earlier...)

2594
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:42,919
(He provided useful information when Roi Ha was the target.)

2595
01:37:43,722 --> 01:37:47,126
(Jong Kook helped So Min when she was pursuing Si Yang.)

2596
01:37:48,092 --> 01:37:49,192
I have to get him.

2597
01:37:49,193 --> 01:37:51,362
(And a while ago, when it was time to bid on Jong Kook,)

2598
01:37:51,363 --> 01:37:56,862
(So Min outbid Ji Hyo with 445 dollars.)

2599
01:37:56,863 --> 01:38:01,501
(Is this So Min's strategy to protect him, the assistant?)

2600
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:07,269
(Then does it mean Jong Kook has really been So Min's assistant?)

2601
01:38:07,842 --> 01:38:08,954
Follow me.

2602
01:38:09,243 --> 01:38:10,858
- Why? - Follow me.

2603
01:38:11,342 --> 01:38:12,464
Follow me.

2604
01:38:12,712 --> 01:38:13,925
Follow me. Run.

2605
01:38:14,413 --> 01:38:16,251
- You're going to catch me. - You're going crazy, right?

2606
01:38:16,252 --> 01:38:17,595
You think you can catch me, right?

2607
01:38:17,653 --> 01:38:20,148
- I'm right in front of you. - This is so upsetting.

2608
01:38:20,892 --> 01:38:22,921
(Kwak Si Yang)

2609
01:38:22,922 --> 01:38:26,599
(Si Yang launches an attack all of a sudden.)

2610
01:38:27,332 --> 01:38:29,001
- Hurry. Hurry, So Min. - What? This guy was alive?

2611
01:38:29,002 --> 01:38:30,315
- Hurry, So Min. - Hey.

2612
01:38:31,302 --> 01:38:33,131
(He shows up like a comet and attacks Jong Kook.)

2613
01:38:33,132 --> 01:38:34,244
Gosh, my arm.

2614
01:38:35,273 --> 01:38:39,612
(With Si Yang's crucial help, Jong Kook is out.)

2615
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:43,942
(Jong Kook wasn't the assistant.)

2616
01:38:43,943 --> 01:38:49,103
(Then it means the real assistant was...)

2617
01:38:50,922 --> 01:38:53,352
(So Min's reliable assistant,)

2618
01:38:53,353 --> 01:38:54,421
(Kwak Si Yang)

2619
01:38:54,422 --> 01:38:55,574
Hello.

2620
01:38:55,792 --> 01:38:57,162
Hello, Si Yang.

2621
01:38:57,163 --> 01:38:59,213
(So Min's reliable assistant, Kwak Si Yang)

2622
01:38:59,632 --> 01:39:03,761
(In the beginning of the race when he was bidding on Se Chan,)

2623
01:39:03,762 --> 01:39:06,931
(he asked So Min about other members' bids.)

2624
01:39:06,932 --> 01:39:09,272
(After sharing Ji Hyo's bid on Se Chan with Si Yang,)

2625
01:39:09,273 --> 01:39:12,343
(the assistant won the bid on Se Chan by a close call.)

2626
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:18,032
(That's how Si Yang could easily eliminate Se Chan.)

2627
01:39:18,212 --> 01:39:20,652
The new target is Kwak Si Yang.

2628
01:39:20,653 --> 01:39:21,763
(When he was chosen as the target...)

2629
01:39:21,853 --> 01:39:23,352
(So Min, make sure no one wins the bid on me.)

2630
01:39:23,353 --> 01:39:26,584
So Min, So Min, So Min.

2631
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:29,322
(Trust me.)

2632
01:39:29,323 --> 01:39:31,291
51 dollars on Si Yang.

2633
01:39:31,292 --> 01:39:33,562
(After checking Jong Kook's bid on him for 50 dollars,)

2634
01:39:33,563 --> 01:39:36,128
(So Min protected him with a bid of 51 dollars.)

2635
01:39:36,502 --> 01:39:39,831
(She pretended to have come to eliminate Si Yang.)

2636
01:39:39,832 --> 01:39:42,202
(But in reality, So Min helped him get away from Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.)

2637
01:39:42,203 --> 01:39:44,641
Gosh, I made a bid for 50 dollars on him.

2638
01:39:44,642 --> 01:39:46,087
- She made a bid for 51 dollars. - Jong Kook.

2639
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:51,742
(Good luck, my assistant. Run far away from here.)

2640
01:39:51,743 --> 01:39:53,412
- You didn't eliminate him, right? - Pardon?

2641
01:39:53,413 --> 01:39:54,652
You didn't eliminate him, right?

2642
01:39:54,653 --> 01:39:55,952
- No, I did. - You did?

2643
01:39:55,953 --> 01:39:57,973
- I did. - Go downstairs. To the basement.

2644
01:39:58,052 --> 01:40:00,322
- You must go right to go down. - Let's go.

2645
01:40:00,323 --> 01:40:01,938
So Min is going to be a rich lady.

2646
01:40:02,493 --> 01:40:03,562
(Everyone thought Si Yang was eliminated.)

2647
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:05,022
Si Yang is out now.

2648
01:40:05,023 --> 01:40:06,331
(Everyone thought Si Yang was eliminated.)

2649
01:40:06,332 --> 01:40:07,676
Si Yang was being chased earlier.

2650
01:40:08,703 --> 01:40:12,102
(Jong Kook who lowered his guard...)

2651
01:40:12,103 --> 01:40:18,671
(was eliminated by Si Yang's unexpected ambush.)

2652
01:40:18,672 --> 01:40:19,711
(Make a call.)

2653
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:22,011
Jong Kook has superpowers, right?

2654
01:40:22,012 --> 01:40:25,316
(The architect and assistant's teamwork stood out in this battle.)

2655
01:40:26,682 --> 01:40:31,369
Song Ji Hyo is sold for 20 dollars to an exclusive bidder.

2656
01:40:31,382 --> 01:40:32,452
Are you the assistant?

2657
01:40:32,453 --> 01:40:33,952
- Stop acting, Jae Seok. - I'm not.

2658
01:40:33,953 --> 01:40:36,416
- We found out everything. - Hey.

2659
01:40:36,962 --> 01:40:38,135
You're the assistant.

2660
01:40:38,493 --> 01:40:40,382
- What are you talking about? - You're the assistant.

2661
01:40:40,892 --> 01:40:42,418
Hey, aren't you the assistant?

2662
01:40:42,962 --> 01:40:45,527
- You made a bid on me for 60. - Yes.

2663
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,801
- That proves you're the assistant. - Forget it.

2664
01:40:47,802 --> 01:40:49,541
- No, no. Listen. - Let go.

2665
01:40:49,542 --> 01:40:50,742
- No, you listen. - Listen.

2666
01:40:50,743 --> 01:40:53,312
- You're the assistant. I'm not it. - I'm... Listen to me.

2667
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:54,641
So Min, you, and I are remaining.

2668
01:40:54,642 --> 01:40:55,641
- It's not me. - You're the assistant.

2669
01:40:55,642 --> 01:40:56,812
- So it's you. - Listen up, Jae Seok.

2670
01:40:56,813 --> 01:40:59,482
(Clueless of Si Yang, Jae Seok thinks Ji Hyo is the assistant.)

2671
01:40:59,483 --> 01:41:01,906
If you do this... Fine, go ahead.

2672
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:03,694
"Make a call." I knew it.

2673
01:41:03,722 --> 01:41:05,051
What? Hold on.

2674
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:07,352
(There's no mark for the assistant. What happened?)

2675
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:08,402
Gosh.

2676
01:41:10,193 --> 01:41:11,334
So Min is coming.

2677
01:41:11,563 --> 01:41:12,662
Say hello to her.

2678
01:41:12,663 --> 01:41:14,582
- You eliminated her? - You two are a team.

2679
01:41:14,762 --> 01:41:16,379
Jae Seok, I'm not the assistant.

2680
01:41:16,733 --> 01:41:18,671
- You're not? - No, I'm not.

2681
01:41:18,672 --> 01:41:20,602
A new target has been chosen.

2682
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:22,996
- Okay, okay. Watch this. - It's you and So Min.

2683
01:41:23,373 --> 01:41:25,120
I'm going to go all-in, Ji Hyo.

2684
01:41:25,342 --> 01:41:27,211
- I'm going all-in. - Jae Seok, you're the assistant.

2685
01:41:27,212 --> 01:41:29,666
- You're not? - No, I'm not.

2686
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,312
If I win the bid, I can eliminate her.

2687
01:41:31,313 --> 01:41:32,511
(If he eliminates her, he will win.)

2688
01:41:32,512 --> 01:41:35,077
Gosh, she fooled us the whole day. So Min, stop right there.

2689
01:41:35,552 --> 01:41:36,622
So Min.

2690
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:40,692
(So Min, stop right there! Jae Seok wins the bid.)

2691
01:41:40,693 --> 01:41:42,322
(So Min runs at full speed as well.)

2692
01:41:42,323 --> 01:41:43,636
No. No.

2693
01:41:44,292 --> 01:41:46,162
(Jae Seok will win if he eliminates the architect.)

2694
01:41:46,163 --> 01:41:47,303
So Min!

2695
01:41:48,462 --> 01:41:50,079
(Bolting)

2696
01:41:50,332 --> 01:41:53,872
(What is this? Things must be urgent.)

2697
01:41:53,873 --> 01:41:56,802
- Ji Hyo, I'll rip it off right now. - Jae Seok, hurry.

2698
01:41:58,002 --> 01:42:00,872
(Jae Seok is chasing after So Min.)

2699
01:42:00,873 --> 01:42:02,211
No, no.

2700
01:42:02,212 --> 01:42:04,612
(He's only a few steps away.)

2701
01:42:04,613 --> 01:42:06,703
Wait, wait. Hold on a second.

2702
01:42:07,552 --> 01:42:10,822
(At times like this, she needs...)

2703
01:42:10,823 --> 01:42:15,122
(her assistant, Si Yang.)

2704
01:42:15,123 --> 01:42:17,547
(So Min! Where are you?)

2705
01:42:19,663 --> 01:42:21,131
What? Why is he here?

2706
01:42:21,132 --> 01:42:22,778
(Wasn't he eliminated?)

2707
01:42:23,033 --> 01:42:26,335
(I thought he was out.)

2708
01:42:28,172 --> 01:42:30,102
(I get it now. He was the assistant.)

2709
01:42:30,103 --> 01:42:31,202
- You're the architect. - I can...

2710
01:42:31,203 --> 01:42:33,341
- eliminate you too. Hear me out. - Wait.

2711
01:42:33,342 --> 01:42:35,029
- Let's stop now. - Hear me out.

2712
01:42:35,283 --> 01:42:38,081
(They're face to face with a pillar in the middle.)

2713
01:42:38,082 --> 01:42:39,681
- Let's stop this now. - I can also...

2714
01:42:39,682 --> 01:42:42,783
(It's a critical moment to eliminate or to be eliminated.)

2715
01:42:42,922 --> 01:42:44,022
Listen to me.

2716
01:42:44,023 --> 01:42:45,051
(Si Yang shows up.)

2717
01:42:45,052 --> 01:42:46,304
- What's this? - Hello.

2718
01:42:46,823 --> 01:42:48,022
(Si Yang holds Jae Seok down.)

2719
01:42:48,023 --> 01:42:49,761
Let go of me. Hey!

2720
01:42:49,762 --> 01:42:52,391
(So Min eliminates Jae Seok right away.)

2721
01:42:52,392 --> 01:42:53,492
What was that?

2722
01:42:53,493 --> 01:42:55,887
(So Min eliminates Jae Seok right away.)

2723
01:42:57,962 --> 01:42:59,072
What was that?

2724
01:42:59,073 --> 01:43:01,931
(He's flustered. "Who is on my back?")

2725
01:43:02,403 --> 01:43:03,654
Weren't you out?

2726
01:43:03,972 --> 01:43:05,184
Good job.

2727
01:43:05,573 --> 01:43:06,772
You thought I was out.

2728
01:43:06,773 --> 01:43:10,721
(I was completely fooled by the assistant whom I wasn't aware of.)

2729
01:43:12,082 --> 01:43:13,452
Good job. You did so well.

2730
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:14,881
- Gosh, I did it. - You showed up at the right time.

2731
01:43:14,882 --> 01:43:16,266
(The architect and the assistant win with their perfect teamwork.)

2732
01:43:18,382 --> 01:43:20,791
The hidden architect of the Friendly Neighbors,

2733
01:43:20,792 --> 01:43:23,115
Out Dot Com Race was So Min.

2734
01:43:23,222 --> 01:43:25,291
And the assistant was Si Yang.

2735
01:43:25,292 --> 01:43:26,847
- I didn't know there was one. - Well done.

2736
01:43:26,962 --> 01:43:28,103
We lost.

2737
01:43:28,262 --> 01:43:29,261
I had no idea about the assistant.

2738
01:43:29,262 --> 01:43:30,862
- I thought he was out. - You didn't know.

2739
01:43:30,863 --> 01:43:33,528
You two will receive today's winning prizes,

2740
01:43:34,002 --> 01:43:36,242
- the coffee truck voucher. - Gosh.

2741
01:43:36,243 --> 01:43:38,272
- We'll send trucks to your shoot. - This is awesome.

2742
01:43:38,273 --> 01:43:39,412
(We'll send the trucks under your names.)

2743
01:43:39,413 --> 01:43:40,787
- This is nice. - That's a great prize.

2744
01:43:41,273 --> 01:43:43,303
- That's pretty good. - This is awesome.

2745
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:45,196
That's a meaningful prize.

2746
01:43:45,582 --> 01:43:47,681
- Roi Ha, share a word with us. - Roi Ha.

2747
01:43:47,682 --> 01:43:48,865
Good job today.

2748
01:43:48,983 --> 01:43:50,622
Thank you for inviting me today.

2749
01:43:50,623 --> 01:43:53,852
Thanks to you, I made great memories. Thank you.

2750
01:43:53,853 --> 01:43:55,022
Rock and roll!

2751
01:43:55,023 --> 01:43:57,820
(Thank you!)

2752
01:43:58,523 --> 01:44:00,992
The victory of today's race goes to So Min and Si Yang.

2753
01:44:00,993 --> 01:44:02,961
(We'd like to thank today's guests, Roi Ha, Hyo Rim, and Si Yang...)

2754
01:44:02,962 --> 01:44:05,325
(for running with us on a very hot day.)
