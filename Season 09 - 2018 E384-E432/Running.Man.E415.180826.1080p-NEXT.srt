1
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:08,898
- Hello.
- Hello.

2
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:10,767
Where is Jae Suk?

3
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,769
There are only five chairs.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,105
- You are right.
- Aren't the others coming?

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,173
- What is that?
- Birthday punch.

6
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:18,742
Birthday cake and birthday punch.

7
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:22,479
Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo's
birthdays...

8
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,447
- are in August.
- That's right.

9
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:27,617
- It's only a few days from now.
- Are we throwing them a party?

10
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,186
- Really?
- I think we are holding an event.

11
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,390
My feelings were hurt
on my last birthday.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,858
- Why?
- There was no birthday punch.

13
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:36,192
I can give you one.

14
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:38,061
(It's a piece of cake.)

15
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,997
- Suk Jin.
- We can give you...

16
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:45,402
- a belated birthday punch.
- You should stay out of it.

17
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,571
I can give you
a belated birthday punch.

18
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,707
Why do people describe birthdays
as "The day your ears pop up"?

19
00:00:50,707 --> 00:00:52,175
- What?
- "The day your ears pop up".

20
00:00:52,175 --> 00:00:55,045
When you are born, your ears
get caught and pop up like this.

21
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,347
- I see.
- So that's what it meant.

22
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:59,883
Suk Jin knows these things well
because he is ancient.

23
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:03,987
He probably saw
a lot of people give birth at home.

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,389
I was born in a hospital!

25
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,224
- What?
- I was born in a hospital.

26
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:11,294
Didn't your mom use
a rope that hangs from the ceiling?

27
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:12,896
I bet he stood outside the room
when his wife gave birth.

28
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,464
I bet he did that
because he was nervous.

29
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,767
- When he heard the cry of a baby,
- What is wrong with you guys?

30
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,103
- "Is it a boy?"
- he'd say, "Is it a boy or a girl?"

31
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,172
"It's a boy!"

32
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:23,940
I bet he did that.

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,610
Today, Jae Suk, Haha, and Ji Hyo
will be born again...

34
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,182
through Happy Death Day,
Along with the Birthdays Race.

35
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:33,450
Happy Death Day?

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,784
(Happy Death Day,
Along with the Birthdays)

37
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,653
Along with the Birthdays?

38
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:39,189
- It's like the new movie.
- "Along with the Birthdays".

39
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:42,058
- That's ingenious.
- Your idea shines.

40
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:46,763
Between a birthday cake
and a birthday punch,

41
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:49,132
which one would you give
to the members?

42
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:51,668
- Are we choosing separately?
- Yes, you are.

43
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,572
To be honest,
I don't care which one they get.

44
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:57,440
It's just that I don't know
which one will benefit me.

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,276
- Birthday punch is the best.
- That's right.

46
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:02,078
You need a good birthday punch...

47
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:03,613
- to live a healthy life.
- Of course.

48
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,815
You will remember
a birthday punch from Jong Kook...

49
00:02:05,815 --> 00:02:07,350
- forever.
- That's right.

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,253
You will have a memory
as well as a scar.

51
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:13,123
I had a bruise for a month.

52
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:15,992
- I will choose the birthday cake.
- I choose the birthday cake too.

53
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:17,293
(Everyone finishes choosing.)

54
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,728
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook
choose the birthday punch.)

55
00:02:18,728 --> 00:02:20,463
(Se Chan, So Min, and Kwang Soo
choose the birthday cake.)

56
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,400
The three people whose birthdays are
in August will soon be eliminated...

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,737
and become the deceased
with an embarrassing nickname.

58
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,539
They will be the deceased.

59
00:02:29,973 --> 00:02:33,877
(Haha becomes New Identity.)

60
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,747
(Ji Hyo becomes Cheon Sung Im.)

61
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,617
I hope Jae Suk comes back
as a more handsome man.

62
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,452
(Jae Suk becomes Ugly Man.)

63
00:02:42,452 --> 00:02:45,989
Kwang Soo, So Min, and Se Chan,
you chose the birthday cake.

64
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,659
You will be the Grim Reapers who try
to prove the deceased innocent...

65
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,728
and reincarnate with them.

66
00:02:51,728 --> 00:02:54,197
Suk Jin and Jong Kook,
you chose the birthday punch.

67
00:02:54,197 --> 00:02:57,267
You will be the prosecutors who try
to prove the deceased guilty...

68
00:02:57,267 --> 00:03:00,003
and reincarnate instead of them...

69
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:02,105
- throughout the mission.
- Prosecutors.

70
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:04,641
- He is an expert nitpicker.
- That's right.

71
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:07,076
- He is an expert nitpicker.
- I will be the Jerk from Anyang.

72
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:09,612
Hold on. Among the three of you,
who is Joo Jin Mo?

73
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:11,548
- It's Ju Ji Hoon.
- Joo Jin Mo?

74
00:03:11,548 --> 00:03:13,183
- Joo Jin Mo?
- He didn't star in that movie.

75
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:14,884
- Ju Ji Hoon.
- Isn't Joo Jin Mo in the movie?

76
00:03:14,884 --> 00:03:17,053
No, he isn't. It's Ju Ji Hoon!

77
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,022
- Ju Ji Hoon.
- Ju Ji Hoon.

78
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:20,156
That means
we are the main characters.

79
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,559
The Grim Reapers were played by
Ha Jung Woo,

80
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,360
- It gets confusing.
- Ju Ji Hoon,

81
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,830
- and Kim Hyang Gi.
- Kim Hyang Gi.

82
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,799
- She is really cute.
- Kim Hyang Gi is really young.

83
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,368
- I can't see So Min as her.
- Are you saying So Min is old?

84
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:34,370
That's not what I said.
I said Kim Hyang Gi is young.

85
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,972
I just said she's young.
I didn't say you are old.

86
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:37,173
She is more like Jo Hyang Gi.

87
00:03:37,173 --> 00:03:38,708
(She's not Kim Hyang Gi.)

88
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,377
She is more like Jo Hyang Gi.

89
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:43,847
(They are practically in
the same age group.)

90
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,915
- I didn't hear her name recently.
- Are you doing all right, Hyang Gi?

91
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,117
- Jo Hyang Gi.
- Jeon Hyang Gi.

92
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:50,019
Jeon Hyang Gi? That sounds weird.

93
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,122
The team
that fails to reincarnate...

94
00:03:53,122 --> 00:03:54,891
will suffer an incredible penalty.

95
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:56,392
- An incredible penalty?
- There is a penalty.

96
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,928
- Are we playing individually?
- If there is a penalty...

97
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:01,531
The person who has the best chance
of reincarnation...

98
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:03,533
- is Jae Suk.
- Why do you say that?

99
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:06,269
He is upright. He has a good image.
He is the national MC.

100
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:08,338
You forget that
we are the prosecutors.

101
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:10,940
- You are right.
- We know all about his past.

102
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,277
To avoid the penalty, you would have
a better chance with Ji Hyo.

103
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:16,012
She rarely receives the penalty.

104
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:18,014
- To reincarnate...
- You have a point.

105
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:19,549
I want to team up with Ji Hyo.

106
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:20,884
- Really?
- Are you set on your choice?

107
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,253
- Yes, I am.
- Then team up with Ji Hyo.

108
00:04:23,253 --> 00:04:26,689
Why did you give up so readily?

109
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,158
- Why did you give up so readily?
- Team up with Ji Hyo.

110
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:31,394
- Why did you give up so readily?
- I will consider my options.

111
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:34,664
- You should have insisted.
- You are set on your choice.

112
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:37,267
How about Haha?
Does he have a good chance?

113
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,636
- Jong Kook knows Haha even better.
- I know Haha well.

114
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:41,738
Since Haha is a weasel,

115
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:43,339
he would be able to overcome
any obstacles.

116
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:46,943
No, no. It won't be so easy
to reincarnate.

117
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:49,112
- That's right.
- He did launder his identity.

118
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:50,346
- That's right.
- This is bad.

119
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,182
- Jong Kook is already in character.
- He is strict.

120
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,751
He committed the gravest sin.

121
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,519
Laundering your identity
is a grave sing.

122
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,888
This is already suffocating.

123
00:05:00,123 --> 00:05:02,392
(Along with the Birthdays,
Reincarnation)

124
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:05,028
(He is guilty by ruining people's
eyes with his shocking looks.)

125
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,597
(Ugly Man's Grim Reaper
is Jeon So Min.)

126
00:05:07,964 --> 00:05:10,900
(She is guilty for confusing others
with her aggressive nature.)

127
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,169
(Cheon Sung Im's Grim Reaper
is Lee Kwang Soo.)

128
00:05:13,403 --> 00:05:16,606
(He is guilty for covering up
his promiscuous past.)

129
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:19,142
(New Identity's Grim Reaper
is Yang Se Chan.)

130
00:05:19,475 --> 00:05:22,512
(The three deceased,
we are on our way to take you.)

131
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:25,381
(She arrives
in the land of the living.)

132
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:29,519
(Is this where Jae Suk is?)

133
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,557
Where is the deceased going?

134
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,161
(When the Grim Reaper calls
the deceased's name three times,)

135
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,862
(the soul leaves the body.)

136
00:05:39,862 --> 00:05:43,199
(Hello.)

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,667
Can't he see me?

138
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:48,137
(She struggles with calling
the deceased.)

139
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:52,241
Yoo Jae Suk.

140
00:05:53,576 --> 00:05:55,445
(Yoo Jae Suk)

141
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,680
What are you doing in a running car?

142
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,249
Yoo Jae Suk.

143
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:02,885
- What is this?
- You are out.

144
00:06:02,885 --> 00:06:05,955
- What?
- Come with me to the underworld.

145
00:06:05,955 --> 00:06:08,558
What do you think... Hold on.

146
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:11,461
What do you think you are doing?

147
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,829
- You passed away...
- Go away.

148
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:15,298
- because you are too ugly.
- Excuse me?

149
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,600
(She stifles her laughter.)

150
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,003
Come with me to the underworld.

151
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:22,271
I will help you reincarnate.

152
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,907
I am your Grim Reaper,
Jeon Hyang Gi.

153
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:26,209
(I can relieve your resentment.)

154
00:06:26,209 --> 00:06:29,879
Jeon Hyang Gi?
You are more like Jeon Fart.

155
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,648
- Jeon Hyang Gi.
- Jeon Fart.

156
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:34,450
- Did you see "Along with the Gods"?
- Yes, I did.

157
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,551
What is that?

158
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,254
You will now be the deceased...

159
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:41,658
- under my care.
- This is crazy. This T-shirt...

160
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:42,659
What is this?

161
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,760
(Shocking)

162
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,261
(Ugly Man)

163
00:06:45,328 --> 00:06:48,197
- Let's go.
- What is this?

164
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,399
(If you want your name back,
reincarnate.)

165
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,800
Do you want me to go away?

166
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,969
(I realized my mistake.)

167
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:56,005
(He goes along with it.)

168
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:57,573
Come.

169
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:58,608
(Let's see...)

170
00:06:58,608 --> 00:06:59,742
Come.

171
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:02,679
(if they will be able
to reincarnate.)

172
00:07:03,212 --> 00:07:06,382
(The second Grim Reaper gets ready
to pick up his deceased.)

173
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:11,087
(Is this where Ji Hyo is?)

174
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:13,189
(Knocking)

175
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:14,457
Song Ji Hyo.

176
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:17,026
(Song Ji Hyo)

177
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,728
- What?
- Song Ji Hyo.

178
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,097
Song Ji Hyo.

179
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:23,599
Song Ji Hyo isn't here.

180
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,370
(This isn't how it goes.)

181
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,371
What?

182
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:31,274
(He focuses once more.)

183
00:07:31,274 --> 00:07:33,276
For goodness' sake, you startled me.

184
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,144
(What is he doing?)

185
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,979
Song Ji Hyo, you are out.

186
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,314
Come with me to the underworld.

187
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:40,817
Why am I already out?

188
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:42,652
- You are out.
- We haven't even begun anything.

189
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:45,188
- You are out.
- What is up with that weird outfit?

190
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:46,889
I am the Grim Reaper.

191
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,459
- I am the Grim Reaper.
- Grim Reaper? When did you die?

192
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:50,960
I didn't die.

193
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,329
You did. I am the Grim Reaper.

194
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,264
You must have become the Grim Reaper
because you died at some point.

195
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:58,267
- I was born as the Grim Reaper.
- You have a problem.

196
00:07:58,267 --> 00:08:00,737
Why did you kill me already
even before we get started?

197
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:02,171
I didn't kill you.

198
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:04,006
Is this how it goes?

199
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:06,743
- Why did you kill me already?
- Shouldn't she be scared?

200
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,277
Why would I be scared?

201
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:10,847
- I am the Grim Reaper.
- His outfit is too small.

202
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:12,381
- This is ridiculous.
- Why didn't I get a bigger outfit?

203
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,016
Is this a miniskirt?

204
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:16,119
- It looks like a dress.
- Why didn't I get a bigger outfit?

205
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:18,020
I have something like this at home.

206
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,756
No, this isn't the same one.

207
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:21,124
The deceased must accompany me.

208
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,458
(He gets into his role
all of a sudden.)

209
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,060
Where are we going? Fine, let's go.

210
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,495
(This is unbelievable.)

211
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:28,731
- When did you become a Grim Reaper?
- I don't know how to play this.

212
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,733
I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

213
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,103
(This Grim Reaper gets into his role
too much in front of the restroom.)

214
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,939
(Walking)

215
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:40,109
(Knocking)

216
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:41,577
(Knocking back)

217
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:43,346
(Look at this deceased.)

218
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:45,948
- Haha.
- I'm in here.

219
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:48,317
(His eyes get shaky.)

220
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:50,319
Haha.

221
00:08:50,319 --> 00:08:53,189
This stall is already occupied.
Sorry.

222
00:08:53,356 --> 00:08:56,893
Haha, you are eliminated.

223
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:59,061
(He's acting.)

224
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,130
The deceased must accompany me.

225
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,799
(He was eliminated while pooping.)

226
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,133
(He's about to start his skit.)

227
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,568
I'm out already?

228
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:08,304
(To the underworld)

229
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:09,605
(Hold on, Grim Reaper Yang.)

230
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:10,807
I'm out?

231
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,341
(Hold on, Grim Reaper Yang.)

232
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:14,343
(He takes the set-up a bit too far.)

233
00:09:14,343 --> 00:09:15,378
I'm out?

234
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:18,548
(He heads to the underworld with
lingering feelings of this world.)

235
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,617
- Reincarnation isn't easy.
- What?

236
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:23,553
It's not a place where they can
just come and go so easily.

237
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:26,022
- They can't look down on our world.
- Exactly.

238
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,057
By the way, where is Queen of Death?

239
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:29,792
I think she's in that black car.

240
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,093
(Queen of Death?)

241
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,461
Queen of Death.

242
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,530
- Shouldn't we be on a palanquin?
- Exactly.

243
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,433
- Gosh, she drives a car instead.
- This is a new model.

244
00:09:37,433 --> 00:09:40,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

245
00:09:40,102 --> 00:09:42,939
- My goodness.
- My gosh. Hello.

246
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:44,040
(I'm the Queen of Death.)

247
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,541
(Noh Sa Yeon)

248
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,478
- Thank you for coming all this way.
- Thank you.

249
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,714
- I'm the prosecutor, Ji Suk Jin.
- Right.

250
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:53,616
- I see.
- What are you eating?

251
00:09:53,616 --> 00:09:55,284
Are you eating red bean buns?

252
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,420
- Come inside.
- Sure, we'll go in.

253
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,589
Since our outfits today
are a bit unusual,

254
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:02,692
- we ought to hear what it's about.
- That's right.

255
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:04,093
Your Royal Highness.

256
00:10:04,093 --> 00:10:06,929
- Am I a queen?
- Yes, you're Queen of Death.

257
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:09,031
- Queen of Death, not the king.
- Queen of Death.

258
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,299
- That's right.
- I like it.

259
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:12,268
Nowadays, you don't ride
the palanquin.

260
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,569
- You get around by car.
- Right.

261
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,771
- This is quite up to date.
- Yes, it is.

262
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:18,407
- The world is changing.
- I see.

263
00:10:18,407 --> 00:10:20,042
Then am I here as a queen today?

264
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:22,111
- You're the Queen of Death.
- Queen of Death.

265
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,479
Anyway,

266
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:24,847
- Suk Jin.
- Yes?

267
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,917
Since I had some buns,
this royal highness is thirsty.

268
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,653
- Bring me some water.
- Sure, I'm on it.

269
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:31,754
I see you had red bean buns.

270
00:10:31,754 --> 00:10:33,789
My goodness, you even have a fridge.

271
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:36,759
- This is a hotel, not a car.
- Gosh.

272
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:37,927
- Here you go.
- Okay.

273
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,763
Thank you for giving me a raise.

274
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,465
- Let me have a bit of my buns.
- Please do.

275
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,901
- She's better than King of Death.
- Definitely.

276
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,802
- She provides good benefits.
- Exactly.

277
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:48,404
Your Majesty,
should I put this on now?

278
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:49,438
Let's take a look.

279
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:52,041
- Your Majesty, please take a look.
- My gosh.

280
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,210
This deceased is trying to
get reincarnated.

281
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,880
The first deceased is Ugly Man.

282
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,650
He displayed distasteful looks
for others to see.

283
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,287
- He lived his life with that face.
- That's right.

284
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,922
No crimes can be worse
than this one.

285
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:09,191
Especially, his jaw area
is infuriating me.

286
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:11,027
That's right. It's protruding a lot.

287
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:13,930
He didn't put any disguise
on his mouth area.

288
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,299
- He is ugly indeed.
- Right.

289
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,234
- That's a serious offense.
- I see.

290
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,836
- The next deceased.
- Let's take a look at the next one.

291
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:22,638
Look at this deceased.

292
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,974
- This deceased is Cheon Sung Im.
- Right.

293
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:26,409
She's too aggressive.

294
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:29,612
First, she looks like a delinquent.
Look at her side bangs.

295
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:32,148
I despise these kinds of girls.

296
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:33,950
- You do, don't you?
- Yes.

297
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,184
She's very aggressive,

298
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,220
so I bet the Grim Reaper
who was to bring her down here...

299
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,190
- He probably had a hard time.
- probably had a tough time.

300
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,892
- How terrible.
- Your Highness.

301
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,560
- Right.
- That's her.

302
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:49,765
- This guy.
- My gosh, this guy.

303
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,434
Doesn't even his appearance
upset you?

304
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,369
- His name is New Identity.
- Look at this guy.

305
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,037
- He's one of us.
- That's right.

306
00:11:55,037 --> 00:11:56,539
This is New Identity.

307
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,541
- Look at this guy.
- He got a new identity...

308
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,608
when he got married.

309
00:11:59,608 --> 00:12:01,243
Doesn't he live in our neighborhood?

310
00:12:01,243 --> 00:12:02,578
- That's correct.
- Yes, he does.

311
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:06,315
He was the most despicable man
you could ever lay your eyes on.

312
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:09,018
- After he got married...
- He pretended to be righteous.

313
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,520
- Right. He's living a fake life.
- I see.

314
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,189
- Okay.
- Strangely,

315
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,391
I want this one to be reincarnated.

316
00:12:15,758 --> 00:12:17,193
- From his photo,
- Is that so?

317
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:19,462
- it looks like he's struggling.
- You think so?

318
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:21,430
- You can't be weak.
- You should never be.

319
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,566
- We must punish them accordingly.
- Okay, okay.

320
00:12:23,566 --> 00:12:24,834
I'll only give you the facts.

321
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:26,702
- I'll be strong today.
- Yes, ma'am.

322
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,304
- I'll be fair.
- Okay.

323
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:29,839
- All right.
- Yes, ma'am.

324
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,742
- Let's go to court.
- Let's go.

325
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:34,577
(Can the deceased convince her
and be reincarnated?)

326
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,980
Come this way, New Identity.

327
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,616
- I lived a bad life.
- You got a whole new identity.

328
00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:43,052
- No, no. I did nothing wrong.
- Come this way.

329
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:45,221
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Why am I being dragged?

330
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,789
Let go of me. Look here.

331
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:48,624
If any of us here are guilty,

332
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,494
- these Grim Reapers must be guilty.
- That's right.

333
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:53,129
(Grim Reapers, my foot!)

334
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,664
- What? We're the Grim Reapers.
- Hey, that was a bit harsh.

335
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:57,600
- We're the Grim Reapers.
- You have to be in our graces.

336
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,301
You're nothing
like the Grim Reapers.

337
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:01,137
- No, we're the Grim Reapers.
- Yes, we are.

338
00:13:01,137 --> 00:13:02,838
Goodness, this is unbelievable.

339
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:05,641
By the way, what's this?
Why did you put this on my shirt?

340
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:07,910
Mine says New Identity.

341
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,846
My mother-in-law keeps asking me
about my past.

342
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:13,749
- You committed a lot of sins.
- What is this?

343
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,851
This photo is scarier
than a Grim Reaper.

344
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,653
- Come on, what is this?
- Look at you, Ji Hyo.

345
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,321
- Gosh.
- Look at her side bangs.

346
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,324
- She totally took money from kids.
- My gosh, I can't believe this.

347
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,260
This photo was from ages ago.

348
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:27,530
Listen to me. You took away
these innocent people's lives.

349
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,864
Is this how you're going to
run the show?

350
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,200
You look so shameless when
you said you were innocent.

351
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,469
Your life was a mess.
It was such a mess.

352
00:13:33,469 --> 00:13:35,337
Where are Jong Kook and Suk Jin?

353
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:37,540
If anyone is guilty, his record
must be the longest.

354
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,409
- Here comes the Queen of Death.
- Here comes the Queen of Death.

355
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:41,744
- What?
- There's the King of Death?

356
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:42,745
"Queen of Death"?

357
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:45,581
Here comes the Queen of Death.

358
00:13:45,648 --> 00:13:46,816
Here she comes.

359
00:13:46,816 --> 00:13:48,451
- Look at these punks.
- My goodness.

360
00:13:48,451 --> 00:13:50,252
- Hello, sir.
- Gosh.

361
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:53,389
- Feel the wrath of the underworld.
- That's right. Okay.

362
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,791
- He looks like a traitor.
- He's the eunuch.

363
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,393
- He's a traitor.
- What? A traitor?

364
00:13:57,393 --> 00:13:59,095
- How dare you?
- How dare you say that to me?

365
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:00,162
- Okay.
- Sure, sure.

366
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:01,464
Hey, we're the prosecutors.

367
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:02,798
- Hey.
- Be on good terms with them.

368
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:04,834
- Sure, sure. I got it.
- We're the prosecutors.

369
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,268
- Look at that.
- Don't you know what day it is?

370
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:08,537
- My gosh, Your Majesty.
- Gosh.

371
00:14:08,537 --> 00:14:10,706
(The underworld's leader shows up
while exuding a strong presence.)

372
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:11,941
- My gosh.
- Hey, Sa Yeon.

373
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:13,209
- She's the Queen of Death?
- Hello, ma'am.

374
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,777
- Queen of Death?
- My goodness.

375
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,945
Have you been well?

376
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,480
- How dare you approach her?
- Your Highness.

377
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,714
- Your Highness.
- How dare you?

378
00:14:18,714 --> 00:14:20,549
- The deceased must step back.
- You're the deceased.

379
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:21,550
- Hello. Hi.
- How dare a deceased...

380
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,619
- Hi.
- Have you been well?

381
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,654
Gosh, Ms. Bambi.

382
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:26,689
Everyone, hold on.

383
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:28,724
Don't give her secret signs
or anything.

384
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:31,026
- I'm so happy to see her.
- How dare you point at her?

385
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:32,128
- We're really close.
- How dare you?

386
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:34,363
You're in the underworld.
You'd better behave.

387
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:36,565
- Don't act all friendly here.
- By the way, there's...

388
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:40,002
- no regulation on hair styles.
- what did you say?

389
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:42,104
- Your bangs are curly.
- We're free to do whatever we want.

390
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:43,939
Can your hair look like
the Niagara Falls?

391
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,408
What? Niagara Falls?
What on earth are you saying?

392
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:48,310
- How dare you?
- What?

393
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,846
- You pushed back your hat.
- I ought to teach you a lesson.

394
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,281
- He got off on the wrong foot.
- Prosecutor.

395
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,116
- Gosh, this is unbelievable.
- You know what?

396
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,452
If the deceased causes trouble,
the Grim Reaper will be punished.

397
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,254
(He makes a threat.)

398
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,522
The Grim Reaper will be punished?

399
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:01,357
- He's going to hit us?
- Seriously?

400
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:03,159
- You can hit us?
- What?

401
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,393
- You can hit us?
- Of course, we can.

402
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,828
- Yes, we can.
- Exactly.

403
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:07,329
(What?
This isn't how you play this.)

404
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:09,131
- You'll hit them in the underworld?
- You bet.

405
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,033
Before we put you in the fiery pit,
I can...

406
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:12,968
- Everyone, let's all sit down.
- Yes?

407
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:14,470
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

408
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,238
(Quiet down.
Let's start our first trial.)

409
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:17,740
All right.

410
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,209
"Before your birthdays, you had
to leave the world of the living."

411
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,011
"Ugly Man, Yoo Jae Suk,"

412
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,679
"New Identity, Haha,"

413
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:25,347
"and Cheon Sung Im, Song Ji Hyo."

414
00:15:25,347 --> 00:15:26,549
"Your reincarnations
are at stake here."

415
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,616
"Happy Death..."

416
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:29,018
(Their reincarnations
depend on this trial.)

417
00:15:29,018 --> 00:15:33,322
"Along with the Happy Messdays..."

418
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:34,456
- Did you write it in English?
- Pardon?

419
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:35,991
Did you write that in English?

420
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:38,327
You should've written in Korean.
Did you write that in English?

421
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:41,397
(Her eyes get bad on an empty
stomach. She needs more buns.)

422
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,999
The Queen of Death is quite old.

423
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:45,768
You ought to show her some respect!

424
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:48,437
- Jong Kook.
- Yes?

425
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:51,106
- Why don't you read this scroll?
- Yes, ma'am.

426
00:15:51,106 --> 00:15:52,408
Let me read this.

427
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:56,345
"The first trial is
the Fiery Pit of Betrayal."

428
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,414
"We'll bring up charges
about the times..."

429
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:02,918
"when you betrayed and deceived
others and punish accordingly."

430
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:05,988
Fiery Pit of Betrayal.

431
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:10,893
They must prove their innocence
with the help of the Grim Reapers.

432
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,530
Each team will get a penalty
depending on the trial's result.

433
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,399
They must carry out a mission
based on the results.

434
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:21,203
Reincarnation Balls will be
distributed based on their rankings.

435
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:24,173
Only the team chosen at
the final gate can be reincarnated.

436
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,642
(3rd place, New Identity,
reincarnated)

437
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,177
If this is the theme,
Ji Hyo will definitely win.

438
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:30,579
- She has never deceived anyone.
- That's right.

439
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:32,014
- I've never betrayed anyone.
- You're an angel.

440
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:33,482
- Right, So Min?
- You're an angel.

441
00:16:33,482 --> 00:16:36,151
"The whole nation recognizes these
three's betrayals and deceits."

442
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,420
"Prosecutors already demanded to
punish them..."

443
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,422
- "with five water slaps."
- That's right.

444
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:42,091
"But I'll show mercy on you.
Depending on the weight..."

445
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:43,325
"Depending on the weight
of your crimes, "

446
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:47,563
"I can reduce the sentence
from 1 to 3 slaps."

447
00:16:47,563 --> 00:16:48,797
- My gosh.
- "Water slaps"?

448
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:52,034
- What have we done? This is crazy.
- "However,"

449
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,638
"the prosecutors will face
the reduced water slaps..."

450
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:57,239
"since they couldn't prove
your crimes..."

451
00:16:57,239 --> 00:17:00,409
"and charged you
with a wrong sentence."

452
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:01,877
We'll face them?

453
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,879
Hey, make sure you read it right.

454
00:17:04,847 --> 00:17:06,215
- This is a great set-up.
- If we defend them well,

455
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:08,284
- the prosecutors will face it.
- That's right.

456
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:11,120
Your Majesty,
your decision is outstanding.

457
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,322
(She's a fair Queen of Death.)

458
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,024
Hey, make sure you read it right.

459
00:17:15,024 --> 00:17:16,458
(This can't be true.)

460
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:17,860
- Are you serious?
- That's what it says.

461
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,528
- Yes, you're right.
- Right.

462
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:21,597
- Make sure they get all 5 slaps.
- 5 water slaps.

463
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:24,333
We'll get to see
the water turning black.

464
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,969
"All right. Prosecution,"

465
00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:30,773
"you may accuse
the deceased of their crimes."

466
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,441
- It's our turn?
- Yes.

467
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,143
Go make your case.

468
00:17:34,143 --> 00:17:37,479
I was reading this
on the Queen of Death's behalf.

469
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:39,081
I'm sorry to interrupt,

470
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,449
but the Kingdom of Death
has changed.

471
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:41,583
Ma'am,

472
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,619
can you have the juice
and the buns next to your throne?

473
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:45,421
(Hey, look.)

474
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,790
- Things have improved around here.
- Listen.

475
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:49,358
- Hold on.
- Those are real buns.

476
00:17:49,358 --> 00:17:51,160
Is there a snack bar
in the Kingdom of Death?

477
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,228
- She always eats it.
- She always eats that.

478
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,664
- That's included in the contract.
- Wait a second.

479
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:57,433
- Hey, you two.
- Yes?

480
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:59,568
- I have something to say.
- How dare you point at us?

481
00:17:59,568 --> 00:18:00,736
I don't know about that.

482
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,939
You look like those people
who take photos with tourists.

483
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:05,908
Hey, we're prosecutors!

484
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:07,309
(We take photos for 1 dollar.)

485
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,346
(Welcome to
the Running Folk Village.)

486
00:18:10,346 --> 00:18:12,648
When it comes to betraying
other people,

487
00:18:12,648 --> 00:18:14,016
that guy can betray others
with his eyes wide open.

488
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:16,151
- That's not true.
- You're in no place to charge us.

489
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:18,754
Working with me means
pure torment for him anyway.

490
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:19,888
(Just so you know.)

491
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:20,889
(Nodding)

492
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,025
- Is he being punished right now?
- Yes.

493
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,194
- He is.
- All right.

494
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:27,029
This is the worst possible torture.

495
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,797
He is being punished right now.

496
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,099
Suk Jin suddenly looks so thin.

497
00:18:30,099 --> 00:18:31,266
It's already been years like that.

498
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,268
(I'd rather be dead.)

499
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:37,172
Keep talking. I'll eat some bread.

500
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:39,007
(This is probably going to
take a while.)

501
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,642
(She suddenly eats bread now?)

502
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:42,111
- Is she really going to eat now?
- For real?

503
00:18:42,111 --> 00:18:43,579
She's really going to eat.

504
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:45,514
It's so noisy in here.

505
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:47,349
I need some rest...

506
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,550
while you guys talk.

507
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:51,787
Usually, those things
are just for show,

508
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,422
but Sa Yeon actually eats them.

509
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:56,158
(I love red bean buns.)

510
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:59,695
- Let's hear about Jae Suk.
- Okay.

511
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,330
I have an allegation to make...

512
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,098
- against Jae Suk.
- All right.

513
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,867
(The trial starts.)

514
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,669
(The first defendant, Yoo Jae Suk)

515
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:09,238
It was Ji Hyo's week.

516
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:10,372
(Do you remember?)

517
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,641
We used a lie detector.

518
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,911
We asked him if he'd marry
his current wife in his next life.

519
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:17,513
- Yes.
- And he answered...

520
00:19:17,513 --> 00:19:19,014
- I answered yes.
- that he would.

521
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:22,217
- Of course.
- And it turned out to be a lie.

522
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,719
(The lie detector said
it was a lie.)

523
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,921
(My goodness.)

524
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:30,159
(Evidence of Jae Suk's lie)

525
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,994
(I'll definitely marry her
in my next life too.)

526
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,763
(He sounded so confident.)

527
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:36,899
(Electric shock)

528
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,568
(It was determined a lie
right away.)

529
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:41,770
(This is not okay.)

530
00:19:42,237 --> 00:19:43,972
(It's understandable.)

531
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:45,441
Don't get the wrong idea.

532
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:48,043
(There's evidence that
Jae Suk lied.)

533
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,211
(That evidence is false.)

534
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:51,447
I still remember it.

535
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:55,083
Do you think a machine can
read a human's mind?

536
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,752
You looked...

537
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,320
very anxious at that time.

538
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,055
(Another piece of evidence)

539
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,423
(I didn't look anxious.)

540
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:04,693
- It's not true.
- So Min, talk to him.

541
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:05,761
That machine doesn't work well.

542
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:08,797
I've used it a few times too.

543
00:20:08,797 --> 00:20:11,700
It gives you an electric shock
if your hand is sweaty.

544
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,669
So if you sweat a lot...

545
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:14,670
or the weather is hot...

546
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,371
Do you sweat a lot?

547
00:20:16,371 --> 00:20:19,408
Yes. My hands get sweaty
when the weather is hot.

548
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:21,477
In that case,

549
00:20:21,477 --> 00:20:23,245
everything I say can be determined
a lie by that machine.

550
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,379
Cut it out!

551
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:25,881
Everything I say can be determined
a lie by that machine.

552
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,216
- But...
- Cut it out!

553
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:29,418
it was my week,
so I remember it clearly.

554
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:32,788
It was a snowy winter day,
and we were in Gangwon Province.

555
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:34,022
It was in winter.

556
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:35,424
- That's right. Way to go!
- We didn't sweat.

557
00:20:35,424 --> 00:20:36,792
(It was a cold day.)

558
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,627
(Oh, right.)

559
00:20:38,627 --> 00:20:39,728
Seriously.

560
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:41,530
Ji Hyo, what are you doing
right now?

561
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,931
What is this?

562
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:45,033
We were wearing winter jackets.

563
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,401
It was really cold.

564
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,237
That's right. Keep going!

565
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:50,372
It was impossible to sweat.

566
00:20:50,372 --> 00:20:51,507
(It doesn't seem like Jae Suk will
be brought back to life.)

567
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:53,208
(Whispering)

568
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,978
(What is he doing?)

569
00:20:55,978 --> 00:21:00,782
We'd like to submit
the lie detector as evidence!

570
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,618
(The lie detector as evidence?)

571
00:21:02,618 --> 00:21:04,419
Do we have it here?

572
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,421
You may try the lie detector.

573
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:08,490
(Will Jae Suk and So Min
be able to prove their points?)

574
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,859
Everyone,
this is the lie detector...

575
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:12,261
- in question.
- That's right.

576
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,495
You sound like a real lawyer.

577
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:16,198
(Witness number 1, lie detector)

578
00:21:16,431 --> 00:21:17,599
Okay.

579
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,868
(Will this prove
Ugly Man's innocence?)

580
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,169
What is that?

581
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:23,171
You can try...

582
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:25,040
It's not a bun!

583
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,743
(It's round and white,
but it's not a bun.)

584
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:30,412
What kind of bun is that?

585
00:21:30,412 --> 00:21:31,780
It's a lie detector.

586
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,981
You can try it.

587
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,383
- Do you want to try it?
- How do you use it?

588
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:35,484
Your hand...

589
00:21:35,484 --> 00:21:37,219
- My hand?
- Like this.

590
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:39,588
Wait. Let me help you.

591
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:41,023
(You're not doing it right.)

592
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:42,224
(Your Highness)

593
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:44,159
- What's this?
- It's the wrong way.

594
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,694
(I'm sorry, but it's the wrong way.)

595
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:46,728
Put your hand on it.

596
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:48,096
(Queen of Death will test
the lie detector.)

597
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:51,266
"In my next life,"

598
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,768
"I'll marry..."

599
00:21:53,902 --> 00:21:55,804
"Lee Moo Song again."

600
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:58,407
(In my next life, I'll marry
Lee Moo Song again.)

601
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,474
No.

602
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:00,475
(Determined)

603
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,476
"No."

604
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:03,378
(This question made Ugly Man
a betrayer.)

605
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:04,913
If it's false, it'd be touching.

606
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:08,917
(Is the queen's answer true?)

607
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:12,454
(It's true.)

608
00:22:12,454 --> 00:22:14,389
(I've already married him once.
Why do it again?)

609
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,258
Hold on.

610
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,859
(The machine seems to work fine.)

611
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:20,128
She really doesn't want to
marry him again?

612
00:22:20,128 --> 00:22:21,530
That machine is flawless.

613
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,598
It's flawless.

614
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:23,899
It works perfectly fine.

615
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:25,000
You said the truth.

616
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,369
(Honey,
don't believe what they say.)

617
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:30,439
(What will happen to my defendant?)

618
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,473
- It's true.
- Yes.

619
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,842
Jae Suk, you should try it again.

620
00:22:33,842 --> 00:22:35,210
- You should try it too.
- Me?

621
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,211
Try it.

622
00:22:36,211 --> 00:22:37,512
I've already tried it.

623
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:40,082
Prosecutor Ji will prove...

624
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:41,817
the accuracy of the machine
once again.

625
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:43,652
- Prosecutor Ji.
- Yes?

626
00:22:43,752 --> 00:22:46,888
Would you marry your current wife,
Ryu Su Jeong,

627
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:50,192
in your next life?

628
00:22:50,192 --> 00:22:51,259
Of course.

629
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:52,561
(Determined)

630
00:22:52,561 --> 00:22:56,031
(Suk Jin is known
for his love for his wife.)

631
00:22:56,031 --> 00:23:01,103
(Is his answer true?)

632
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:02,938
(True)

633
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:04,172
It's not right.

634
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:05,207
Did you see that?

635
00:23:05,207 --> 00:23:06,441
He shook his hand on purpose.

636
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,509
It wasn't true?

637
00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:09,978
This machine is unreliable.

638
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:11,246
That's right.

639
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,381
It's been proven.

640
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,883
This machine malfunctions...

641
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:16,918
from time to time.

642
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:19,054
- Jae Suk is innocent.
- I'm innocent.

643
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:20,822
- That machine doesn't work, right?
- It doesn't.

644
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:22,658
What I said was a lie too.

645
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:23,725
(She takes it back.)

646
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:25,560
But it was true.

647
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:27,429
- Let me try one more time.
- You want to?

648
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:29,097
- Yes.
- All right.

649
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:31,400
(I don't think it's a good idea.)

650
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,703
Queen of Death will try it
one last time.

651
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:36,471
Would you marry...

652
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:38,273
Lee Moo Song...

653
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,109
in your next life too?

654
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,210
Yes!

655
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,779
(Confident)

656
00:23:43,879 --> 00:23:47,049
She is Queen of Death.
She never lies.

657
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:48,550
It's definitely true.

658
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,520
(She says the opposite this time.
Is it true?)

659
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,587
Gosh, it hurts.

660
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:54,256
(Her answer is false.)

661
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,091
(Surprised)

662
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,194
(It's impossible to defend her now.)

663
00:23:59,194 --> 00:24:00,862
- It's false.
- It's false.

664
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,030
(She doesn't want to
marry her current husband again.)

665
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:03,298
The machine...

666
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:05,400
is so accurate!

667
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,170
Everyone, that machine is accurate.

668
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,838
(Flustered)

669
00:24:09,838 --> 00:24:11,907
I'm so surprised.

670
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:15,811
- It's accurate.
- It's so accurate.

671
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,245
See?

672
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:20,649
This machine malfunctions a lot.

673
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:21,683
It's unreliable.

674
00:24:21,683 --> 00:24:22,918
What are you talking about?

675
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,986
Also, I've overheard...

676
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:27,689
Jae Suk's phone conversations
with his wife...

677
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,658
so many times.

678
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:30,659
What does he say?

679
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:33,228
For example, when we shoot abroad,

680
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,963
right before we get on the plane,

681
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:39,301
"Kyung Eun, we're about to
get on the plane. Okay."

682
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,169
(Embarrassed)

683
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:42,637
Stop it.

684
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:45,507
I said to him,
"You're such a loving husband."

685
00:24:45,507 --> 00:24:47,442
He became embarrassed and said,

686
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:48,744
"I'm not."

687
00:24:48,744 --> 00:24:50,378
It's happened many times.

688
00:24:50,378 --> 00:24:52,147
- That's all.
- What about afterwards?

689
00:24:52,147 --> 00:24:55,217
After he gets off the phone,
he sighs. I've seen it.

690
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,019
(Haha accuses Jae Suk.)

691
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,788
That brat...

692
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,123
It's not true.

693
00:25:01,123 --> 00:25:03,492
I've never seen that.

694
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:05,560
How do you know
if it was Na Kyung Eun...

695
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,695
or Choi Kyung Eun?

696
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,463
(Suk Jin is desperate.)

697
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:09,464
What are you talking about?

698
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,133
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What is that supposed to mean?

699
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,001
- What is he talking about?
- How do you know that?

700
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:16,138
But doesn't every husband
do that much?

701
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:17,272
- Not everyone does.
- Who doesn't?

702
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:18,507
The one next to you doesn't.

703
00:25:18,507 --> 00:25:20,609
(Prosecutor Ji doesn't.)

704
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:24,246
I don't call my wife often.

705
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:26,648
Why? Our love is so deep.

706
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:29,217
Jae Suk calls his wife
as if it was his homework...

707
00:25:29,217 --> 00:25:31,119
because their love is shallow.

708
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:33,088
It's even been aired a few times.

709
00:25:33,088 --> 00:25:35,090
Suk Jin often says,
"I don't want to go home."

710
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,559
(I've heard it.)

711
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:38,727
"I'd rather work."

712
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:41,696
"I want to go home late."
He's said that many times.

713
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,298
(Suk Jin is no help.)

714
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:45,000
Are you okay?

715
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,168
I'm not.

716
00:25:46,168 --> 00:25:47,169
(He might lose his position
as a prosecutor and a husband.)

717
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:49,004
- That's all.
- Good job, So Min.

718
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:51,339
You can see that...

719
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:53,542
Jae Suk is guilty, right?

720
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:56,077
- Not really.
- No?

721
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:58,647
(Fail)

722
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:00,715
- Let me make a decision.
- Okay.

723
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:02,017
(Verdict)

724
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,618
Jae Suk...

725
00:26:03,618 --> 00:26:06,421
(Ugly Man tried to defend himself
against his charges.)

726
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:09,157
(What's the verdict?)

727
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:11,359
Since I can't trust the machine,

728
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,862
you'll get one less slap.

729
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:17,632
(As the machine is unreliable,
Jae Suk gets 1 less slap.)

730
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:18,667
(Then who gets the slap instead?)

731
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:22,370
And Prosecutor Ji will slapped.

732
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,039
(Suk Jin pretended to be a loving
husband and framed Jae Suk.)

733
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,609
The prosecutor will be slapped
instead of Jae Suk.

734
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:29,377
Nice!

735
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:30,445
Me?

736
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:33,081
(The prosecutors will be slapped
instead.)

737
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:36,251
All right. Haha,

738
00:26:36,384 --> 00:26:37,752
do you know why you're a betrayer?

739
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:38,753
Me?

740
00:26:38,753 --> 00:26:40,222
- He's not.
- You betrayed something huge.

741
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:41,556
- Me?
- You betrayed yourself.

742
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:44,059
Haha betrayed his past.

743
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,627
I did?

744
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:48,296
(The second defendant, Haha)

745
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:49,464
His life?

746
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:50,999
He betrayed...

747
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,467
his own life.

748
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,768
Gosh.

749
00:26:53,768 --> 00:26:55,570
We all know that...

750
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,205
Haha used to be
Seorae Village's trash.

751
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,240
Seorae Village's trash.

752
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,008
(Haha used to be
Seorae Village's trash.)

753
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:02,310
Was I alone?

754
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,879
(I wasn't alone.)

755
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:05,013
This guy.

756
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,848
(This guy was with me.)

757
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,150
Me? I was just sitting here.

758
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,752
(Frustrated)

759
00:27:10,752 --> 00:27:12,020
Look.

760
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,522
The thing is, that guy...

761
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:16,725
is still a piece of trash.

762
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:18,159
Me?

763
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,761
He hasn't...

764
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,529
tried to hide his past.

765
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:23,265
I don't want him
as my Grim Reaper anymore.

766
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:24,532
It's not true.

767
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:25,533
I'm worried.

768
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,669
He doesn't deserve to sit here.

769
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:28,703
It's not true.

770
00:27:28,703 --> 00:27:30,705
I just...

771
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,774
had some fun.
I'm not a bad person.

772
00:27:32,774 --> 00:27:35,010
He's been working hard
since he got married.

773
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:36,511
We need to...

774
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,947
find out the truth...

775
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:41,216
of the charges against Haha.

776
00:27:41,216 --> 00:27:42,784
That's why we brought a witness.

777
00:27:42,784 --> 00:27:44,419
- What? A witness?
- We brought a witness.

778
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:45,420
Really?

779
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,122
Who could it be?

780
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:49,457
Witness, please come in.

781
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:55,463
(The witness has been
stabbed in the back by Haha.)

782
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:56,531
(Who is the witness?)

783
00:27:56,531 --> 00:27:57,632
Where is he?

784
00:27:57,632 --> 00:28:01,036
(Who is the witness?)

785
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:02,804
- Sang Yeob?
- Okay.

786
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:04,039
It's Sang Yeob.

787
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:06,441
(Witness Lee Sang Yeob)

788
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:07,442
It's Sang Yeob.

789
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:08,643
- Over here, Sang Yeob!
- Really?

790
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,979
Sang Yeob!

791
00:28:11,046 --> 00:28:13,949
You're not allowed to speak to him.

792
00:28:14,082 --> 00:28:17,986
(Your Highness, I'm Lee Sang Yeob
from the mortal world.)

793
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:20,121
You're handsome.

794
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:25,393
(What's the New Identity crime
that Sang Yeob will reveal?)

795
00:28:25,393 --> 00:28:27,228
What happened to you?

796
00:28:27,228 --> 00:28:28,730
It's a long story.

797
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,567
- It was early 2008.
- And?

798
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:34,602
I was happy
after receiving an award...

799
00:28:34,602 --> 00:28:36,004
when I got a call.

800
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:39,207
I was told that I was a teenage star
that made 2017 shine.

801
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:41,676
I congratulate you even to this day.

802
00:28:41,676 --> 00:28:44,980
(First recording of the year
on January 2, 2018)

803
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:50,618
(Haha and Kwang Soo call Sang Yeob
for their mission.)

804
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:57,192
(They lure him by offering
a teenage star award.)

805
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:59,995
(Come and get your award.)

806
00:28:59,995 --> 00:29:02,630
(Sang Yeob is very excited.)

807
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:07,168
I got ready in one hour
to receive the award and prize.

808
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:08,937
- I came to Hongdae.
- That's right.

809
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:10,672
However, what I received was...

810
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:13,441
- a piece of paper.
- A piece of paper.

811
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:15,343
- A piece of paper?
- It was a piece of paper.

812
00:29:15,343 --> 00:29:16,711
(Paper award and
plastic bottle as a trophy)

813
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,747
- I got a plastic bottle.
- A plastic bottle?

814
00:29:18,747 --> 00:29:21,683
That's so disappointing.

815
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,919
I could accept that,

816
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,122
but on top of that,
they called Geun Sik.

817
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:29,090
- That's right.
- That's true. I remember.

818
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,127
I was only given
a small portion on the show.

819
00:29:32,127 --> 00:29:34,429
You had me share it with Geun Sik.

820
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:37,932
That's how you and Geun Sik
became close.

821
00:29:37,932 --> 00:29:39,300
That's not all.

822
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,469
You get free food when you come
to my barbecue restaurant.

823
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,505
(You get free food
at my restaurant.)

824
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:44,639
That's...

825
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,908
It's all thanks to Geun Sik.

826
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,910
- Does he get free food?
- Yes.

827
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,178
Okay.

828
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:51,279
(Two restaurant owners
feel uncomfortable.)

829
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,947
He accepted it.

830
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,817
- I see.
- What's going on between you two?

831
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:57,218
What's going on between you two?

832
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:58,720
There's more.

833
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,922
- I was sleeping in the morning.
- Right.

834
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:02,957
I got another call.

835
00:30:02,957 --> 00:30:06,361
They said I was number one celebrity
whom people want to travel with.

836
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:08,430
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

837
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,731
(Early March in 2018)

838
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,500
(Even Ji Hyo joins this time.)

839
00:30:12,901 --> 00:30:14,669
(Within three months in 2018)

840
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:21,076
(They tell that he's number one star
whom people want to travel with.)

841
00:30:21,076 --> 00:30:24,279
(Sang Yeob ends up on
Tsushima Island.)

842
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,851
(He's number one celebrity whose
step counter people want to shake.)

843
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:34,556
- They're crooks.
- They told me to bring my passport.

844
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:35,623
(He's a terrible man.)

845
00:30:35,623 --> 00:30:38,560
- Look at him.
- They told me to bring my passport.

846
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,529
The witness's feelings got hurt
a lot.

847
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,631
- I certainly did.
- Right.

848
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:46,367
My goodness. Seriously?

849
00:30:47,135 --> 00:30:49,137
- There's one more.
- One more?

850
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:50,538
One more?

851
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:54,442
They wanted to assign me a character
as I'm new to variety shows.

852
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:57,579
- I became Vicarious Man,
- Right.

853
00:30:57,579 --> 00:31:00,849
and I had to do zip-lining.

854
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:02,750
(They made him zip-line instead.)

855
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:06,454
(Haha creates Vicarious Man
to make him zip-line instead.)

856
00:31:06,454 --> 00:31:09,224
(Sang Yeob was a fool to accept it.)

857
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:12,627
You said I'll be on commercials
if I become Vicarious Man.

858
00:31:12,627 --> 00:31:14,662
I didn't get any commercial offers.

859
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:17,732
(They sweet-talked to him.)

860
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:20,168
Make people call me.

861
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,438
You ask for too high of a price.

862
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:25,840
(It's not my fault.)

863
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,509
(I'll lower my price, so call me.)

864
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,444
You aren't good enough yet.

865
00:31:29,444 --> 00:31:31,713
I was there when he became
Vicarious Man.

866
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:33,348
- He isn't good enough indeed.
- Witness.

867
00:31:33,348 --> 00:31:35,083
- Yes?
- What did Suk Jin say?

868
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:37,018
Did he say anything
when you got the nickname?

869
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:39,454
- I was quiet.
- That I'll get commercial offers.

870
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:42,991
(He encouraged me that
I'll get offers.)

871
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,859
(He was bad too.)

872
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:49,597
He asked me,
"Who makes pizza deliveries?"

873
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:50,598
"I'll do it."

874
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:51,599
(He even told him what to say.)

875
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,968
(You'll get a call soon.)

876
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:57,038
When I asked, "What if you became
Vicarious Man?"

877
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:58,706
You could have said no.

878
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,275
But who accepted it?

879
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:02,577
- He's very smart.
- Who was it?

880
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:04,112
He tricked me.

881
00:32:04,112 --> 00:32:07,148
- I didn't trick you.
- No, he didn't.

882
00:32:07,148 --> 00:32:10,451
- I have text messages.
- Who tricked you?

883
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:11,753
He's submitting text messages.

884
00:32:11,753 --> 00:32:13,488
- I'll submit text messages.
- He's submitting text messages.

885
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:17,859
He thanked me for making him
Vicarious Man.

886
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,794
(The witness thanked him.)

887
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:22,697
His boss made a phone call himself.

888
00:32:22,697 --> 00:32:24,999
He thanked me for naming Sang Yeob
Vicarious Man.

889
00:32:24,999 --> 00:32:28,203
- How can we even trust the witness?
- I have it all.

890
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:30,505
- Read them.
- Please read them.

891
00:32:30,505 --> 00:32:33,007
- We should read them.
- It's just one of many messages.

892
00:32:33,007 --> 00:32:34,842
Please read all of them.

893
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:38,680
"There's still penalty,
but thank you so much, Haha."

894
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:41,849
"Thanks to you,"

895
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:44,352
"I got to be on my favorite show
Running Man."

896
00:32:44,352 --> 00:32:46,554
"I got close to other members."

897
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:48,923
"It's all because you invited me
and took care of me."

898
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,459
"Thank you so much."
What's "yes, man"?

899
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:53,428
Then he definitely wrote it.

900
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:56,097
- Wait. Goodness.
- Yes, man.

901
00:32:56,097 --> 00:32:59,367
The judges brought
the wrong person as a witness.

902
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,569
The evidence is clear.

903
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:04,439
- Right? It's clear.
- It is.

904
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,707
I have a similar story.

905
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,408
(He counterattacks.)

906
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:09,611
When I was a rookie on Running Man,

907
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:11,479
I was at home,

908
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:13,715
and Haha called me
out to Garosu-gil.

909
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:17,652
He said he didn't have proper shoes
for a wedding tomorrow.

910
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:19,887
And he added that
his mission is to buy...

911
00:33:19,887 --> 00:33:21,889
brown dress shoes sized 285mm
in 10 minutes.

912
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:23,024
(Haha's betrayal)

913
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:24,759
(He tells Kwang Soo
to bring him shoes.)

914
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,628
- It's true. I swear.
- Look at him.

915
00:33:26,628 --> 00:33:29,764
It was in the middle of summer.

916
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:32,667
I ran across Garosu-gil
soaked in sweat.

917
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,669
I bought him brown dress shoes.

918
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,571
- He cleared the mission.
- I bought him a pair.

919
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:38,740
- He cleared the mission.
- I cleared his mission myself.

920
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,343
Gosh, he's a terrible man.

921
00:33:42,343 --> 00:33:45,380
Listen, it's true.

922
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,849
It's true that it was a mission.

923
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:50,718
Now I'll deliver my ruling.

924
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:54,555
I conclude that
Haha committed serious betrayal.

925
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:55,623
No, I didn't.

926
00:33:55,623 --> 00:33:58,726
- I sentence you to five buckets.
- This is unfair.

927
00:33:58,726 --> 00:34:01,663
- How can you do this to him?
- This is so unfair.

928
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,631
- Come on.
- I won't accept it.

929
00:34:03,631 --> 00:34:06,668
Mr. Witness, he made your character.

930
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,069
(I'll call you after
I shoot a commercial.)

931
00:34:08,636 --> 00:34:11,039
I don't think Ji Hyo is guilty.

932
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,409
- No?
- No one has attacked her.

933
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:16,778
(They accept it.)

934
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:19,013
I reduce your sentence
by two buckets.

935
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,615
- Reduce by two buckets?
- Okay.

936
00:34:20,615 --> 00:34:22,350
(Ji Hyo's sentence is reduced
by two buckets.)

937
00:34:22,817 --> 00:34:24,719
(Jae Suk and So Min get 3,
Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo get 3.)

938
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,121
(Haha and Se Chan get 5,
Jong Kook and Suk Jin get 4.)

939
00:34:27,488 --> 00:34:30,425
The first game to
repent your betrayal...

940
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:33,528
is Deity's Quiz.

941
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:36,664
Deity's Quiz.

942
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:38,599
There are a total of three problems.

943
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:42,670
Play The Rose of Sharon Has Bloomed
according to Sang Yeob's order.

944
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,741
Pick the flag
with the correct number.

945
00:34:47,175 --> 00:34:48,576
When you answer correctly,

946
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:51,579
you can pass your water bucket
to any team of your choice.

947
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:55,183
Reincarnation Balls are distributed
according to the ranking.

948
00:34:55,183 --> 00:34:56,417
(Reincarnation Balls are distributed
according to the ranking.)

949
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:58,720
The team standing last must
get all the water buckets...

950
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,421
to move to the next round.

951
00:35:00,421 --> 00:35:02,156
(The team standing last
must get all water buckets.)

952
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:04,926
(Water buckets as a penalty
and Reincarnation Balls on the line)

953
00:35:04,926 --> 00:35:06,227
Okay.

954
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:08,730
There's no point of going there
if we don't know the problem.

955
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,331
- Right.
- I don't know the answer.

956
00:35:10,331 --> 00:35:11,733
We should pick a flag first.

957
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:14,769
- Here's your first question.
- Okay.

958
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:17,138
The penalty is one water bucket.

959
00:35:17,138 --> 00:35:18,806
- One bucket.
- Okay.

960
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,742
(They can pass one water bucket.)

961
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:22,710
(Move out of my way.)

962
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,014
This refers to a special blessing
given by the Christian deity.

963
00:35:27,014 --> 00:35:30,718
It usually means the ability
to control the mass...

964
00:35:30,718 --> 00:35:33,588
- and make people follow.
- Okay.

965
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:36,424
- "Make people follow"?
- It means "Deity gives blessing"...

966
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:40,261
in Greek. What is this word?

967
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:44,632
1, talent. 2, charisma.

968
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:48,870
3, chic. 4, catharsis.

969
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,471
- "Catharsis"?
- What?

970
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:53,007
(It's a confusing question.)

971
00:35:53,007 --> 00:35:54,342
I have no idea.

972
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:55,343
(What is he doing?)

973
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,477
- It's not yet.
- Do we go now?

974
00:35:56,477 --> 00:35:58,112
(He runs anyway.)

975
00:35:58,112 --> 00:35:59,280
It's not yet.

976
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,349
(You must hear my order first.)

977
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,117
- You're ugly.
- Did you see that?

978
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,119
He deserves one water bucket.

979
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,488
He deserves one water bucket.
Eliminate him.

980
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,657
- Eliminate him.
- I didn't know.

981
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:12,293
Queen, I'm very sorry.

982
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,028
I didn't know.

983
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:15,997
- I'll forgive you once.
- Okay.

984
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:18,132
Queen of Death is too nice.

985
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:21,035
- She's extremely nice.
- She's too nice.

986
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,771
- You'll be out next time.
- Yes, ma'am.

987
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:27,008
She's too soft-hearted.

988
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:30,745
I'll start
The Rose of Sharon Has Bloomed.

989
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,014
- I'll go easy at first.
- Okay.

990
00:36:33,014 --> 00:36:37,285
Stand on one foot,
the rose of Sharon has bloomed

991
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,287
He moved.

992
00:36:39,287 --> 00:36:41,289
(They run first.)

993
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,491
(Hopping)

994
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:45,726
(Standing on one foot)

995
00:36:45,726 --> 00:36:46,861
(It's very difficult.)

996
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,729
- You're out.
- Someone pushed me.

997
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:51,432
- Kwang Soo is out.
- Someone pushed me.

998
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:52,867
- How?
- Do you know the answer?

999
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,101
I'm Christian.

1000
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:56,170
(I know the answer.)

1001
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,371
(Kwang Soo was too eager.)

1002
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:59,974
You sat down instead of standing up.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1003
00:36:59,974 --> 00:37:00,975
You're out.

1004
00:37:00,975 --> 00:37:02,577
(He goes back to the start line.)

1005
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:04,178
Be sexy.

1006
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:06,848
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1007
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:09,817
- That's sexy.
- Ji Hyo and Jae Suk ran.

1008
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:12,019
- That's sexy.
- They're out.

1009
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:13,488
- That's sexy.
- Why...

1010
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:15,857
That wasn't sexy.

1011
00:37:15,857 --> 00:37:18,693
Be sexy, Ji Hyo. You must look sexy.

1012
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:21,128
(Like this?)

1013
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:24,732
(What do you think, Queen?)

1014
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:26,968
(She's very content.)

1015
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:29,937
- Look at his sexy leg muscles.
- They aren't sexy.

1016
00:37:29,937 --> 00:37:31,839
- Look at him.
- He isn't sexy.

1017
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,208
He is sexy indeed.

1018
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,577
He is sexy. Come here, Suk Jin.

1019
00:37:36,577 --> 00:37:38,679
- Why?
- You aren't sexy at all.

1020
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,348
(Wait a minute.)

1021
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:41,382
(How can I look sexier than this?)

1022
00:37:41,382 --> 00:37:43,618
- How can I look sexier?
- You deserve a hit.

1023
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:45,286
- Come back to the line.
- How is this sexy?

1024
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,388
- This is sexy enough.
- It's not sexy.

1025
00:37:47,388 --> 00:37:49,657
- Come back to the line.
- Go back.

1026
00:37:50,658 --> 00:37:51,826
(Isn't this sexy enough?)

1027
00:37:51,826 --> 00:37:53,361
Next is...

1028
00:37:53,694 --> 00:37:55,162
grab another person by the collar.

1029
00:37:55,162 --> 00:37:58,132
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1030
00:37:58,132 --> 00:38:00,368
(By the collar?)

1031
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:03,237
(They grab him first.)

1032
00:38:03,237 --> 00:38:05,640
Everyone who didn't grab
other's collar, please go back.

1033
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,975
- So Min didn't grab anyone.
- She didn't grab anyone.

1034
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,510
Why is everyone doing this to me?

1035
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,578
- This is...
- Why are you doing this to me?

1036
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:13,180
I think Kwang Soo grabbed
my shoulder.

1037
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,617
- Is it the collar?
- He moved his hand slowly.

1038
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:18,152
Express your love
for another member.

1039
00:38:18,152 --> 00:38:20,021
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1040
00:38:20,054 --> 00:38:23,157
(Kwang Soo gets number 1,
and Jong Kook number 2.)

1041
00:38:23,858 --> 00:38:25,159
(I really love you.)

1042
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,727
This doesn't count.

1043
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:27,762
So Min is faking it.

1044
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,998
- You're out.
- Who?

1045
00:38:30,998 --> 00:38:32,800
You're just being loved. You're out.

1046
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,770
- What? What is this?
- It doesn't count.

1047
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:38,906
- I love Haha.
- Haha, you're out.

1048
00:38:38,906 --> 00:38:40,541
Haha, you're out.

1049
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:42,977
- You're out.
- You're out.

1050
00:38:42,977 --> 00:38:44,679
You look so frustrated.

1051
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,280
Love is not like that.

1052
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,381
I love Jong Kook.

1053
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:48,849
I was expressing my love too.

1054
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:51,018
- Jong Kook doesn't love anyone.
- He's gone.

1055
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:53,688
The one I love is gone.

1056
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,856
I love Se Chan,

1057
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:57,992
but he's gone. Gosh.

1058
00:38:57,992 --> 00:38:59,360
Someone please stop Kwang Soo!

1059
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,661
Hey!

1060
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:02,830
Please stop him!

1061
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:04,699
You two are left, right?

1062
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:05,766
- Please do something.
- Yes.

1063
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:07,768
My answer is
number two, "charisma".

1064
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:10,538
(Is "charisma" the right answer?)

1065
00:39:10,538 --> 00:39:12,807
Okay. Number two, "charisma".

1066
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:16,377
My answer is
number two, "charisma".

1067
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:18,179
Okay!

1068
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:20,748
(Jong Kook is right.)

1069
00:39:21,382 --> 00:39:22,617
(That's strange.)

1070
00:39:22,617 --> 00:39:23,651
Good.

1071
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:25,052
(It's not number 1?)

1072
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:26,120
Okay.

1073
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,089
- You're a Christian.
- You...

1074
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:29,256
(You're a Christian.)

1075
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:30,324
I'm sorry, Lord.

1076
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,994
(Embarrassed)

1077
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:35,496
(My faith is not strong enough.)

1078
00:39:35,496 --> 00:39:37,331
Who should get the slap?

1079
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,766
- The slap?
- Yes.

1080
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,635
Let's give it to the team
with the least slaps.

1081
00:39:40,635 --> 00:39:43,037
We'll give it to the team
with the least slaps.

1082
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,205
(Team Ugly Man has 4 slaps now.)

1083
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:45,373
- Yes!
- Seriously.

1084
00:39:45,373 --> 00:39:48,476
This time,
you can transfer two slaps.

1085
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:49,677
(2 slaps)

1086
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:51,979
(Let's do this.)

1087
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:53,581
Here goes the question.

1088
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:56,717
Which of the following...

1089
00:39:56,717 --> 00:40:00,187
has never played
as the Grim Reaper?

1090
00:40:00,187 --> 00:40:01,522
That's hard.

1091
00:40:01,522 --> 00:40:03,357
Number one, Lee Dong Wook.

1092
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:05,760
Number two, Jung Il Woo.

1093
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,329
Number three, EXO's Kai.

1094
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:10,998
- I know this.
- Number four, Gang Dong Won.

1095
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:14,168
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1096
00:40:14,168 --> 00:40:16,170
(There is
no additional instruction.)

1097
00:40:16,737 --> 00:40:19,206
(Jae Suk, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan
fail to stop.)

1098
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:20,941
You're all out.

1099
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,977
- Someone pushed me.
- Who pushed him?

1100
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:24,679
Kwang Soo pushed me.

1101
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,880
(Please listen to me.)

1102
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,615
- That's right.
- These two are out.

1103
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:29,350
I should stay here.

1104
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,118
- I stay here.
- You pushed him?

1105
00:40:31,118 --> 00:40:32,119
He pushed me.

1106
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,320
- I didn't!
- He pushed me.

1107
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,822
Jae Suk is such a smooth talker.

1108
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:37,992
Everything he says
sounds so convincing.

1109
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:39,060
Sa Yeon.

1110
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,661
(Ugly Man is a smooth talker.)

1111
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:41,996
Your Highness, it's true.

1112
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:43,731
He pushed me.

1113
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:45,700
That's why I couldn't stop...

1114
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,169
- and ended up here.
- I know that.

1115
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:50,638
The rule says that
the one who moves should be out.

1116
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:53,841
But you sound so convincing.

1117
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,243
(You sound so convincing.)

1118
00:40:56,243 --> 00:40:58,479
- I can't eliminate you.
- Let's say I'm out.

1119
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,181
I won't get you in trouble.

1120
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,849
I'm out.

1121
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:03,217
All right.

1122
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:06,120
- She trusts him completely.
- Here we go.

1123
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,559
Get a member on your back.
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1124
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:13,427
They're all out.

1125
00:41:13,427 --> 00:41:15,062
- They're all out.
- They're all out.

1126
00:41:15,162 --> 00:41:17,832
(It's a mess.)

1127
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:20,067
Hold on.

1128
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,902
It hurts!

1129
00:41:21,902 --> 00:41:23,738
- Jae Suk...
- I have someone on my back.

1130
00:41:23,738 --> 00:41:25,206
You survive.

1131
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:27,041
Jae Suk survives.

1132
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,176
- Jong Kook survives too.
- I had someone on my back.

1133
00:41:29,176 --> 00:41:31,378
Jong Kook survives.
You guys are out.

1134
00:41:31,412 --> 00:41:33,481
Go to the back.

1135
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:34,949
Why am I out?

1136
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,284
I should have gotten
on someone's back.

1137
00:41:37,284 --> 00:41:38,819
Let's continue.

1138
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:44,158
(The correct answer is
number 4, Gang Dong Won.)

1139
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:48,095
(The one who gets the flag first
will win.)

1140
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,330
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1141
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,333
(Suk Jin gets flag number 4.)

1142
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:56,370
(Jong Kook blocked
the other players.)

1143
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,538
There you go.

1144
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:59,406
- He got the flag.
- He got the flag.

1145
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:01,175
Suk Jin got the flag.

1146
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:04,111
- Why couldn't you get it?
- I touched it.

1147
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:05,513
This is our answer.

1148
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:06,781
- Number four.
- Who?

1149
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:08,783
(Who?)

1150
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:10,151
- Number four?
- Who?

1151
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:11,385
Don't tell him.

1152
00:42:11,385 --> 00:42:12,953
5, 4...

1153
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:16,257
(You know it's Gang Dong Won,
right?)

1154
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:18,159
Lee Bong Won?

1155
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,628
(What?)

1156
00:42:20,628 --> 00:42:22,496
(His name ends with "Won" too,
but they're very different.)

1157
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:24,098
It ends with "Won".

1158
00:42:24,765 --> 00:42:26,767
"Won"...

1159
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:29,403
You're doing this on purpose, right?

1160
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:31,539
- Lee Bong Won?
- Jong Kook is angry.

1161
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,107
I gave you the chance.

1162
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:35,976
- Gosh.
- It ends with "Won".

1163
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:38,212
I know it ends with "Won".

1164
00:42:38,212 --> 00:42:39,680
- Lee Bong Won...
- Stop it.

1165
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,848
I don't remember his name.

1166
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,183
(Laughing)

1167
00:42:42,183 --> 00:42:43,517
Do the wave.

1168
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,519
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1169
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:47,121
Number four,

1170
00:42:47,221 --> 00:42:48,823
Gang Dong Won.

1171
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:51,959
(Haha says the correct answer.)

1172
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:54,028
Gang Dong Won.

1173
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:55,796
(It's confusing.)

1174
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:57,431
We can transfer two slaps, right?

1175
00:42:57,431 --> 00:42:59,300
Who should get it?

1176
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,402
Hold on. Who should get it?

1177
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:03,204
(Team New Identity can
transfer 2 slaps.)

1178
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:05,739
- You should avoid finishing bottom.
- That's right.

1179
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:07,408
- Give everything to one team.
- Right now...

1180
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:08,542
Give it to New Identity.

1181
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:09,777
Team Prosecutor has four.

1182
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:11,879
- We're New Identity.
- Yes.

1183
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:15,249
(Oh, right.)

1184
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:18,219
(Thank you for the tip.)

1185
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:20,187
- Let's give it to Prosecutor.
- Did you try to make us lose?

1186
00:43:20,187 --> 00:43:22,289
- Give it to them.
- We should give it to Prosecutor.

1187
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:24,592
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

1188
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:27,061
Why would you make things worse?

1189
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:29,496
They have five now,

1190
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:33,167
- and we have four.
- You're right.

1191
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,468
Gosh.

1192
00:43:34,468 --> 00:43:36,704
I don't want to be on the same team
with Suk Jin.

1193
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:39,173
1, 2, 3.

1194
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:40,241
- Prosecutor.
- Prosecutor.

1195
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,810
(Team Prosecutor gets 2 slaps.)

1196
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:43,878
We had   no choice.

1197
00:43:43,878 --> 00:43:46,814
If you hadn't said that, we might
have given it to another team.

1198
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:49,617
(Team Prosecutor is at the bottom
with 5 slaps.)

1199
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:51,118
This time,

1200
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:52,620
you can transfer three slaps.

1201
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,321
(You can transfer 3 slaps
for the last question.)

1202
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:56,757
- 3 slaps?
- 3 slaps? Now, you're talking.

1203
00:43:57,324 --> 00:43:58,893
(Here goes the question.)

1204
00:43:58,893 --> 00:44:01,929
"Which of the following..."

1205
00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:02,897
(But...)

1206
00:44:02,897 --> 00:44:05,399
(What?)

1207
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:06,600
(Puzzled)

1208
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,536
- It's the other one.
- It's the other one.

1209
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:14,008
(I was wondering
why my voice wasn't louder.)

1210
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:15,309
Your Highness!

1211
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:17,711
(Queen of Death makes
the members laugh.)

1212
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:20,481
She thought the hammer was
the megaphone?

1213
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,116
Ms. Bambi is the best!

1214
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:25,386
They do look similar.

1215
00:44:25,386 --> 00:44:28,222
(Cute)

1216
00:44:28,222 --> 00:44:30,591
- You can transfer three slaps.
- Okay.

1217
00:44:31,191 --> 00:44:34,662
"In Greek mythology, this fairy..."

1218
00:44:34,662 --> 00:44:38,799
"has an upper body of a woman
and a lower body of a bird."

1219
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:42,870
"Its singing voice lures sailors
to their deaths."

1220
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:47,308
"There is also a sound device
that has the same name."

1221
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,576
"Number one, megaphone."

1222
00:44:49,677 --> 00:44:51,679
"Number two, siren."

1223
00:44:51,912 --> 00:44:53,814
"Number three, speaker."

1224
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:55,616
"Number four, amp."

1225
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:58,819
Shout, "Long live Lee Sang Yeob!"
sincerely.

1226
00:44:58,953 --> 00:45:00,487
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1227
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:02,489
- Long live Lee Sang Yeob!
- Long live Lee Sang Yeob!

1228
00:45:02,489 --> 00:45:05,225
(Sincere)

1229
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:06,360
(Striding)

1230
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,462
Hey, he moved.

1231
00:45:08,462 --> 00:45:10,130
Let me see your faces.

1232
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,532
(Sang Yeob checks
if they look sincere.)

1233
00:45:11,532 --> 00:45:13,367
Kwang Soo moved.

1234
00:45:13,634 --> 00:45:15,769
He looks so sincere.

1235
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:16,804
- Long live Lee Sang Yeob!
- Let's try again.

1236
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:18,038
Kwang Soo looks so sincere.

1237
00:45:18,038 --> 00:45:19,573
- Yes, I am.
- I love your sincere face.

1238
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,075
Let's try again.

1239
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:24,578
Hold your shoe in your right hand.
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1240
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:25,980
Gosh.

1241
00:45:26,547 --> 00:45:27,614
(They all hold their shoes
in their right hands...)

1242
00:45:27,614 --> 00:45:29,917
(except Haha.)

1243
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:32,219
(He manages to take his shoes off.)

1244
00:45:32,219 --> 00:45:34,154
It's your left hand.

1245
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:36,190
The others are okay.

1246
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,659
Put your shoe back on.

1247
00:45:38,659 --> 00:45:39,760
(Put your shoe back on.)

1248
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,228
The rose of Sharon has bloomed

1249
00:45:41,228 --> 00:45:43,497
(Kwang Soo gets flag number 3.)

1250
00:45:43,497 --> 00:45:47,368
(Jae Suk stops him
from putting his shoe back on.)

1251
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,003
I put it back on!

1252
00:45:49,003 --> 00:45:50,904
I put it back on! This is not okay.

1253
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:52,539
I put it back on!

1254
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,209
(Meanwhile,)

1255
00:45:55,209 --> 00:45:58,779
(Ji Hyo gets flag number 2.)

1256
00:45:59,813 --> 00:46:02,149
- What's your answer?
- Number 2, siren.

1257
00:46:02,149 --> 00:46:03,817
(Confident)

1258
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:06,887
(Ji Hyo has been doing well.
Is she correct this time too?)

1259
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,622
It's correct!

1260
00:46:08,622 --> 00:46:10,791
(Ji Hyo's answer is correct.)

1261
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:13,227
(She might become the quiz queen.)

1262
00:46:13,227 --> 00:46:16,830
(Team Cheon Sung Im can
give 3 slaps to another team.)

1263
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:17,931
You can choose.

1264
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,533
(Ugly Man 4, New Identity 3,
Prosecutor 5)

1265
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:21,802
(Their decision will determine
which team finishes as the bottom.)

1266
00:46:21,802 --> 00:46:23,704
- What's your choice?
- Ji Hyo has made up her mind.

1267
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:25,272
(Their decision will determine
which team finishes as the bottom.)

1268
00:46:25,272 --> 00:46:32,312
(Who will finish as the bottom
and be slapped?)

1269
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:34,148
1, 2, 3.

1270
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:35,582
- Team Ugly Man.
- Team Ugly Man.

1271
00:46:35,582 --> 00:46:38,552
(We choose Team Ugly Man.)

1272
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:41,088
Gosh. How could you?

1273
00:46:41,121 --> 00:46:42,322
Suk Jin was quiet this time.

1274
00:46:42,322 --> 00:46:43,791
You should be quiet.

1275
00:46:43,791 --> 00:46:45,826
Every time I'm on the same team
with Jae Suk,

1276
00:46:45,826 --> 00:46:47,027
I lose.

1277
00:46:47,027 --> 00:46:49,596
Don't you realize
I might think the same?

1278
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:50,998
So Min.

1279
00:46:50,998 --> 00:46:52,499
We're not meant to be together.

1280
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,037
(Cheon Sung Im 20, New Identity 10,
Prosecutor 5, Ugly Man 0)

1281
00:46:57,037 --> 00:46:59,840
- I mean...
- Eight slaps is too much.

1282
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,941
- Please start.
- How do you do it?

1283
00:47:00,941 --> 00:47:02,843
- Splash the water on his face.
- You want the blue bowl?

1284
00:47:02,843 --> 00:47:04,244
- Splash the water on his face.
- Seriously?

1285
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:05,279
- It's okay.
- It's just water.

1286
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:06,780
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1287
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,850
1, 2, 3.

1288
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,387
(Powerful)

1289
00:47:13,387 --> 00:47:16,090
(It's like a typhoon.)

1290
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,359
(Sang Yeob splashes
the second bowl of water.)

1291
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,428
Sa Yeon did a great job.

1292
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:22,930
Seriously.

1293
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:25,532
(This is so much fun.)

1294
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:27,968
- I'm excited.
- She's excited.

1295
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:30,637
Here we go.

1296
00:47:30,637 --> 00:47:31,638
One...

1297
00:47:31,638 --> 00:47:32,840
(Team Prosecutor is ready.)

1298
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,108
2, 3.

1299
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:36,510
(The sound is so loud.)

1300
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:38,812
(Shocked)

1301
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:39,947
Gosh.

1302
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:41,615
- Suk Jin.
- Seriously.

1303
00:47:41,615 --> 00:47:43,550
What is this?

1304
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,219
- So Min...
- Are you okay?

1305
00:47:45,219 --> 00:47:46,887
Seriously...

1306
00:47:46,887 --> 00:47:48,522
- I didn't know it'd be that strong.
- Is my nose bleeding?

1307
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:49,556
(Confused)

1308
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:51,658
Suk Jin should be slapped.

1309
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:53,093
This is too much.

1310
00:47:53,093 --> 00:47:54,661
- You should be slapped too.
- You should be slapped too.

1311
00:47:54,661 --> 00:47:55,829
Why?

1312
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:56,997
Do it later.

1313
00:47:56,997 --> 00:47:58,132
You should be slapped too.

1314
00:47:58,132 --> 00:47:59,800
- Why would I be slapped?
- You should be.

1315
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,101
Don't be ridiculous.

1316
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:02,803
- Here's my verdict.
- Okay.

1317
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:06,306
- Suk Jin hit So Min too hard.
- That's right.

1318
00:48:06,306 --> 00:48:08,709
He should be punished for it.

1319
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:09,710
You're really good at acting.

1320
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,378
All of you can splash water on him.

1321
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:12,980
I want to do it.

1322
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,281
Let's all do it.

1323
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:16,450
- Why are we doing this?
- I want to do it.

1324
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,619
- Do it.
- You hit So Min way too hard.

1325
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:19,920
Why should I get hit?

1326
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,121
He's making me so angry.

1327
00:48:21,121 --> 00:48:24,558
1, 2, 3.

1328
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:26,360
(Slap)

1329
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,427
(Here's one.)

1330
00:48:27,427 --> 00:48:28,428
Goodness.

1331
00:48:28,428 --> 00:48:29,630
No.

1332
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,231
(He gets six water bucket slaps.)

1333
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,901
(Suk Jin becomes a new person.)

1334
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:36,103
(Kwang Soo finishes.)

1335
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:40,240
(He gets dizzy.)

1336
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,842
Who went last?

1337
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:44,878
(It hurts so much.)

1338
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,280
Are you okay?

1339
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,781
You were too harsh.

1340
00:48:47,781 --> 00:48:49,516
- Kwang Soo.
- What do you mean?

1341
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:50,717
Why are you accusing me?

1342
00:48:50,717 --> 00:48:52,519
- How was I too harsh?
- Hey, you.

1343
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:53,887
That was too harsh.

1344
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:54,922
Who went last?

1345
00:48:54,922 --> 00:48:57,991
Kwang Soo also deserves
to get slapped.

1346
00:48:57,991 --> 00:48:59,459
Let's do it.

1347
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,495
Wait a minute.

1348
00:49:01,495 --> 00:49:03,096
Hey, wait.

1349
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:05,265
Suk Jin.

1350
00:49:05,265 --> 00:49:07,067
Boogers came out from his nose.

1351
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:10,237
(He asked to blur the sight.)

1352
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:11,638
He has boogers.

1353
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:13,941
It was too harsh.

1354
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:14,975
Wipe it off for him.

1355
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:16,009
(Don't just stare at him.)

1356
00:49:16,009 --> 00:49:18,679
He's over 50 years old,
and his nose is running.

1357
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:19,947
Suk Jin.

1358
00:49:19,947 --> 00:49:21,682
(Isn't he pitiful?)

1359
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:24,718
Take care of Suk Jin.

1360
00:49:24,718 --> 00:49:26,653
- Okay?
- I saw him from afar.

1361
00:49:26,653 --> 00:49:28,789
I hoped it wasn't his booger.

1362
00:49:28,789 --> 00:49:30,057
But it really was.

1363
00:49:30,057 --> 00:49:31,458
You guys are worse. Come here.

1364
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:32,726
I took care of him.

1365
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:35,329
1, 2, 3.

1366
00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:36,363
Goodness.

1367
00:49:36,363 --> 00:49:37,998
(A loud thud)

1368
00:49:38,265 --> 00:49:42,469
(It's clear whose turn it is next
after Kwang Soo gets slapped.)

1369
00:49:42,469 --> 00:49:44,037
- Switch roles.
- Switch.

1370
00:49:44,037 --> 00:49:45,472
Switch roles.

1371
00:49:45,606 --> 00:49:50,077
- It was too harsh.
- He punched me.

1372
00:49:50,344 --> 00:49:51,578
- It feels like he punched me.
- Kwang Soo.

1373
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:53,347
Okay, Kwang Soo.

1374
00:49:53,347 --> 00:49:54,615
- Are you okay?
- Hit Suk Jin.

1375
00:49:54,615 --> 00:49:56,950
- He's a terrible man.
- It felt like a punch.

1376
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:59,419
- He's a gangster.
- It feels like I was punched.

1377
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:01,788
This bucket is an apology.

1378
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:03,690
- After this one, hug each other.
- Okay.

1379
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,560
- Kiss each other on the cheek.
- Okay.

1380
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:08,495
(It'll end the battle.)

1381
00:50:08,495 --> 00:50:12,099
1, 2, 3.

1382
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:15,202
(A clear slap)

1383
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:18,138
(I love you. Thank you,
Suk Jin.)

1384
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:19,139
(It's heartwarming.)

1385
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:22,309
No matter how much I think

1386
00:50:22,309 --> 00:50:23,710
(Kiss)

1387
00:50:25,045 --> 00:50:26,113
They did it.

1388
00:50:26,113 --> 00:50:27,748
(I'm sorry too.)

1389
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:28,982
That's good.

1390
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,550
We made up.

1391
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:32,286
- Goodness.
- That's beautiful.

1392
00:50:32,286 --> 00:50:33,687
(They head to the next underworld.)

1393
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:35,789
What's this?

1394
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:37,190
Is it another trial?

1395
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,458
There's another one.

1396
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,660
- Is it another trial?
- It's another trial.

1397
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:40,727
(What kind of trial awaits them?)

1398
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:43,030
Give us your orders.

1399
00:50:43,363 --> 00:50:46,266
(The second underworld)

1400
00:50:46,266 --> 00:50:50,304
(Meal tickets and
Reincarnation Balls depend on it.)

1401
00:50:50,304 --> 00:50:52,406
The second trial will be held...

1402
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:55,142
(Goodness)

1403
00:50:55,909 --> 00:50:57,511
(She hits herself
with her squeaky hammer.)

1404
00:50:57,511 --> 00:51:00,147
(It's very embarrassing.)

1405
00:51:00,147 --> 00:51:01,181
(Queen of Death's funny underworld
starts.)

1406
00:51:01,181 --> 00:51:02,949
That was a funny act.

1407
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:05,218
- Are you okay?
- It was her funny act.

1408
00:51:05,218 --> 00:51:06,920
What do we do?

1409
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,089
How did you do it?

1410
00:51:09,089 --> 00:51:10,357
In this way,

1411
00:51:10,357 --> 00:51:12,159
how many times can you make
people laugh?

1412
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,593
Seriously.

1413
00:51:13,593 --> 00:51:14,861
It has various functions.

1414
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,229
(I need to keep my face.)

1415
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:19,766
The second trial will take place
in Greed Underworld.

1416
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,568
Avoid it.

1417
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:24,271
Greed Underworld.

1418
00:51:25,205 --> 00:51:29,042
It's a place for those
who harmed others out of greed.

1419
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:32,512
Their time to get food
depends on their greed.

1420
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:34,548
(Their time to get food
depends on their greed.)

1421
00:51:34,715 --> 00:51:36,616
(They must defend themselves
to enjoy the buffet.)

1422
00:51:36,616 --> 00:51:37,851
It's a buffet.

1423
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:39,720
- There's a variety.
- It's a buffet.

1424
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,322
(What will their sentences be?)

1425
00:51:42,622 --> 00:51:44,958
I'll punish Cheon Sung Im.

1426
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,027
(Judge Suk Jin starts.)

1427
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:49,096
- For what?
- What kind of greed?

1428
00:51:49,096 --> 00:51:50,497
What about me?

1429
00:51:50,497 --> 00:51:52,499
Cheon Sung Im is greedy about sleep.

1430
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:55,068
- That's right.
- She sleeps too much.

1431
00:51:55,068 --> 00:51:56,837
(She feels nervous.)

1432
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:59,339
She's famous for sleeping
on top of Jenga pieces.

1433
00:51:59,339 --> 00:52:00,707
(That day is memorable.)

1434
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:02,909
(While playing a game
on top of Jenga pieces,)

1435
00:52:02,909 --> 00:52:05,746
(she takes a deep nap.)

1436
00:52:05,746 --> 00:52:08,949
(It's a nap that left
a mark in history.)

1437
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:11,752
You should pay for sleeping.

1438
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:14,788
I've been partners with Ji Hyo
quite often.

1439
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:17,090
I talked to myself for 10 minutes.

1440
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,725
I didn't know she was sleeping.

1441
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:20,527
Her greed for sleep is...

1442
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:21,828
It's a serious sin.

1443
00:52:21,828 --> 00:52:23,096
Something should be done.

1444
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:25,265
- It's been long.
- She's too greedy for sleep.

1445
00:52:25,265 --> 00:52:26,700
She sleeps too much.

1446
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,001
She's greedy about sleep.

1447
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:29,002
What else?

1448
00:52:29,002 --> 00:52:30,937
As her representative...

1449
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:35,409
(Kwang Soo has a chance
to defend Ji Hyo.)

1450
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:37,344
I have nothing to say to defend it.

1451
00:52:37,344 --> 00:52:38,879
(As her representative,)

1452
00:52:38,879 --> 00:52:40,680
(her lawyer gives up.)

1453
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,982
- You admit it?
- Yes.

1454
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:43,216
- I see.
- I have nothing to say.

1455
00:52:43,216 --> 00:52:44,751
She sleeps so much.

1456
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:45,786
She's greedy about sleep.

1457
00:52:45,786 --> 00:52:47,954
- Talk to us.
- Explain to us.

1458
00:52:47,954 --> 00:52:48,955
(Only Ji Hyo can turn it around.)

1459
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:51,658
- I accept it to an extent.
- Really?

1460
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:53,660
However,

1461
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,596
I stopped myself from sleeping
as much as I could.

1462
00:52:56,596 --> 00:52:58,131
- Is that so?
- You did?

1463
00:52:58,131 --> 00:52:59,399
- How?
- I did my best.

1464
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:01,268
- Really?
- She's greedy about sleep.

1465
00:53:01,268 --> 00:53:02,969
That's true.

1466
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:04,037
Also...

1467
00:53:04,037 --> 00:53:05,172
(Suk Jin makes an accusation.)

1468
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:07,674
I was very disappointed in Jae Suk
during our last shoot.

1469
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:08,842
Why?

1470
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,977
Instead of taking care
of his younger colleague...

1471
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:14,648
Do you remember when
Kwang Soo took off his belt?

1472
00:53:14,648 --> 00:53:19,219
- That's right.
- Who grabbed it and ran away?

1473
00:53:19,486 --> 00:53:22,556
(Kwang Soo tries to sell his belt
to get money.)

1474
00:53:22,556 --> 00:53:24,324
(Kwang Soo is full of hopes.)

1475
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:26,626
(Jae Suk takes it and runs away.)

1476
00:53:26,626 --> 00:53:29,262
(He runs after him
with all his might.)

1477
00:53:29,262 --> 00:53:31,631
(Falling off)

1478
00:53:31,932 --> 00:53:35,569
(His private life is revealed
unexpectedly.)

1479
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:39,539
(Kwang Soo's tears fall
like his pants.)

1480
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:41,541
- You took my belt.
- Why did you take it and run away?

1481
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:43,243
It was worth money.

1482
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:45,212
- It's like he stole money.
- He's a thief.

1483
00:53:45,212 --> 00:53:46,279
He's greedy.

1484
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:47,948
He took Running Money and ran away.

1485
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:49,749
- It was for himself.
- You said a good thing, Suk Jin.

1486
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:51,518
Let me say something.

1487
00:53:51,651 --> 00:53:53,520
Do we actually get paid for that?

1488
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,455
(Do we actually get paid
for the belt?)

1489
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:57,357
- No, it's Running Money.
- No, right?

1490
00:53:57,357 --> 00:53:59,826
Did your pants fall off
because I took it?

1491
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:01,127
They did.

1492
00:54:01,127 --> 00:54:02,696
Did you get on camera?

1493
00:54:02,696 --> 00:54:04,097
(Did you get on camera?)

1494
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:06,867
(He's shown on camera
thanks to Jae Suk.)

1495
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:08,835
If you say it that way,

1496
00:54:08,835 --> 00:54:11,037
there's nothing he can say.

1497
00:54:11,037 --> 00:54:13,139
He got one cut on the show.

1498
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:15,242
Just because I took it,

1499
00:54:15,242 --> 00:54:17,711
does it bring me money or gold?

1500
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,346
Wait, listen to me.

1501
00:54:19,346 --> 00:54:21,915
I didn't get on camera.

1502
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:23,750
It was this part of my body.

1503
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,719
I didn't get to be on camera.

1504
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:27,721
- Listen.
- It was my crotch.

1505
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:28,989
I was considering Kwang Soo.

1506
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:31,591
However, because of what happened,

1507
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:33,326
Kwang Soo did get on camera.

1508
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:34,928
- My friends ask me.
- Ask you what?

1509
00:54:34,928 --> 00:54:36,329
If Kwang Soo is really a fool.

1510
00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:38,632
(He's being serious.)

1511
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:39,799
(Anyone on Running Man
gets asked the same question.)

1512
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:41,368
That's what happens.

1513
00:54:41,368 --> 00:54:42,402
- Right?
- Yes.

1514
00:54:42,402 --> 00:54:45,572
Even when my friends ask me that,

1515
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:47,507
I don't say a word.

1516
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,009
Why not?

1517
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:50,076
Why wouldn't you say anything?

1518
00:54:50,076 --> 00:54:52,078
- You should deny it.
- You should.

1519
00:54:52,078 --> 00:54:53,346
You should say that I'm not.

1520
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:54,614
- How can you say nothing?
- If...

1521
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:56,016
If I say that he's not,

1522
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:58,018
they'll think that I'm lying
because I'm close to him.

1523
00:54:58,018 --> 00:54:59,019
- They'll think you're lying?
- That's why...

1524
00:54:59,019 --> 00:55:01,922
- I don't say anything.
- Who thinks like that?

1525
00:55:02,355 --> 00:55:03,757
I don't say anything.

1526
00:55:03,757 --> 00:55:05,659
Let me ask you now.

1527
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:07,427
Is Kwang Soo a fool or...

1528
00:55:07,427 --> 00:55:09,729
(She's serious.)

1529
00:55:09,729 --> 00:55:11,498
What are you talking about?

1530
00:55:11,498 --> 00:55:13,099
- It's ambiguous.
- From...

1531
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:14,768
the perspective of someone
who cares about Kwang Soo,

1532
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:16,169
let me tell you accurately.

1533
00:55:16,169 --> 00:55:17,404
Seriously.

1534
00:55:17,404 --> 00:55:18,872
We cannot say...

1535
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:20,640
Kwang Soo isn't a fool.

1536
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,842
- I see.
- What do you mean?

1537
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:26,580
(Today's conclusion is that
we cannot say that he isn't a fool.)

1538
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,448
- That's right.
- Kwang Soo.

1539
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:30,116
- Honestly.
- How can you say that?

1540
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:32,052
- Kwang Soo.
- That's even worse.

1541
00:55:32,052 --> 00:55:34,321
- It sounds stranger.
- We cannot say no.

1542
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,455
- He's right.
- I agree.

1543
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:36,656
- Okay.
- Next,

1544
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,058
- it's Haha.
- Say it.

1545
00:55:38,058 --> 00:55:39,059
What about Haha?

1546
00:55:39,059 --> 00:55:41,661
- I'm not greedy at all.
- He isn't greedy at all.

1547
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:44,731
- We get to say it today.
- It's time to say it.

1548
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:46,900
- They're so serious.
- Haha.

1549
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,302
(He says it carefully.)

1550
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:01,247
He's ambitious about singing.

1551
00:56:01,247 --> 00:56:03,149
(He's ambitious about singing.)

1552
00:56:03,149 --> 00:56:05,518
- He's already a singer.
- That's not being greedy.

1553
00:56:05,518 --> 00:56:06,586
He's a singer.

1554
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:07,854
He isn't a comedian.

1555
00:56:07,854 --> 00:56:11,591
He may simply like reggae
and other types of music.

1556
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:12,592
Right.

1557
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,928
However, he never sings live...

1558
00:56:14,928 --> 00:56:16,329
wherever he goes.

1559
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:18,498
(He doesn't ever sing live.)

1560
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:19,633
No, I've seen him.

1561
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:21,301
I saw him recently.

1562
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:22,369
You know what?

1563
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:24,938
- He sang live.
- I've made music with Haha.

1564
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:26,172
I also performed with him.

1565
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:28,708
- Doesn't he sing live?
- I asked Haha...

1566
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,243
to send me his accompaniment.

1567
00:56:30,243 --> 00:56:32,078
- And?
- I asked him to send it.

1568
00:56:32,078 --> 00:56:35,281
However, he sent me
his entire song.

1569
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:37,183
- No.
- I asked for accompaniment.

1570
00:56:37,183 --> 00:56:38,685
- It was...
- The volume...

1571
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:41,121
- What?
- was lower than AR.

1572
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:42,689
Right, that's true.

1573
00:56:42,689 --> 00:56:43,723
(That's such a small detail.)

1574
00:56:43,723 --> 00:56:46,860
The recording of my accompaniment
includes my breathing.

1575
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,894
(Haha defends himself.)

1576
00:56:47,894 --> 00:56:49,429
It sounds like I'm singing live.

1577
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:50,897
- Really?
- He sings well live.

1578
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:52,999
(Let's analyze Haha's recording
used for the performance.)

1579
00:56:52,999 --> 00:56:55,101
(Recording of "Dang Diggi Bang")

1580
00:56:55,101 --> 00:56:57,937
(It sounds like a recording
of Haha's singing.)

1581
00:56:57,937 --> 00:57:01,441
(It's definitely accompaniment
for performances.)

1582
00:57:01,441 --> 00:57:04,577
(Is it the secret behind
their live singing?)

1583
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:05,979
I agree.

1584
00:57:05,979 --> 00:57:08,148
I use sound effects
more than others.

1585
00:57:08,281 --> 00:57:10,316
- Wait a minute.
- He says it's okay.

1586
00:57:10,316 --> 00:57:11,518
Apart from greed,

1587
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:15,188
how can you humiliate
your colleague like that?

1588
00:57:15,188 --> 00:57:16,589
(That's not just greed.)

1589
00:57:16,656 --> 00:57:19,459
- This is not humiliating. Listen.
- Is it not?

1590
00:57:19,459 --> 00:57:20,827
- You are...
- How is that humiliating?

1591
00:57:20,827 --> 00:57:22,362
- asking him to compare the audio...
- Come on.

1592
00:57:22,362 --> 00:57:23,530
- and the accompaniment.
- How is that humiliating?

1593
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:26,166
- You're humiliating him.
- Haha said it was okay.

1594
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:27,667
- Are you all right?
- He said so.

1595
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:30,937
His greed is
about humiliating others.

1596
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:32,439
(He gets up.)

1597
00:57:32,439 --> 00:57:33,707
(He's the best in the underworld
for humiliating others.)

1598
00:57:33,707 --> 00:57:35,709
- I'll give him that.
- I agree.

1599
00:57:35,709 --> 00:57:37,877
I sometimes get confused.

1600
00:57:37,877 --> 00:57:40,880
I can't tell if he's serious
or if he's joking.

1601
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:43,149
- I get confused too.
- If he's funny, it's a joke.

1602
00:57:43,149 --> 00:57:45,351
- But if he's not, it's my fault.
- I agree.

1603
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:46,419
No, that's not true.

1604
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,089
This is his crime. Please be aware.

1605
00:57:49,089 --> 00:57:51,891
- All right.
- I get it.

1606
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:53,460
I'll be persistent.

1607
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:57,897
Queen of Death has made
wise decisions so far.

1608
00:57:57,897 --> 00:58:00,166
We made our points.

1609
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,768
(What's the mission
before the final ruling?)

1610
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:04,738
"The plates that will be used are
small dishes for soy sauce,"

1611
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:06,740
"regular plates,
and buffet plates."

1612
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,110
"There are three different plates
at various distances."

1613
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,644
It's all different.

1614
00:58:11,644 --> 00:58:13,947
What would you eat
with such a small dish?

1615
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,717
"For your reference, the losing team
will have to carry me..."

1616
00:58:17,717 --> 00:58:20,887
"when we are going
to the final location,"

1617
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:22,622
"so please keep that in mind."

1618
00:58:22,622 --> 00:58:24,457
(If you lose,)

1619
00:58:24,457 --> 00:58:26,559
(you will get the honor of carrying
Queen of Death.)

1620
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,330
(Jong Kook can't keep
a straight face at the news.)

1621
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:32,098
That's the biggest penalty.

1622
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:34,067
(He can't read the situation.)

1623
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,535
- That is...
- What?

1624
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,837
- It was him.
- That's rude.

1625
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:40,440
- You've been doing this all day.
- You are so clueless.

1626
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,708
What is wrong with you?

1627
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,310
(He's clueless, and Queen of Death
doesn't like him. What will happen?)

1628
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:48,648
From this side, it's small dish,
regular plate, small dish,

1629
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:51,217
and the red area is
for the buffet plate.

1630
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:53,586
- This...
- This is too...

1631
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:56,089
There's a bomb.

1632
00:58:56,656 --> 00:58:58,458
You're telling us to choose
a regular plate.

1633
00:58:58,458 --> 00:58:59,859
- Exactly.
- I know.

1634
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:02,362
- Go first.
- Let's go.

1635
00:59:02,362 --> 00:59:04,798
- Haha.
- Haha, go for the regular one.

1636
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:06,432
I'm hungry.

1637
00:59:06,432 --> 00:59:08,067
You don't have to go for
the small dish.

1638
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,536
Which one are you picking?

1639
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:12,172
He's going to be a coward
and go for the regular one.

1640
00:59:12,172 --> 00:59:15,208
He's going to be a coward.

1641
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,977
Go for it. Come on, Haha.

1642
00:59:17,977 --> 00:59:21,781
- Good luck.
- What if he can't reach?

1643
00:59:21,781 --> 00:59:22,882
He got it.

1644
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:24,417
You're tough.

1645
00:59:24,417 --> 00:59:26,152
Don't grab it too high.

1646
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:28,354
- You look like a gymnast.
- Swing more.

1647
00:59:28,354 --> 00:59:30,957
- That's more than enough.
- Swing more.

1648
00:59:30,957 --> 00:59:32,959
Swing more.

1649
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:34,561
(Many people are cheering for him.
How far will he jump?)

1650
00:59:34,561 --> 00:59:36,062
- No...
- That's not enough.

1651
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:39,098
- Swing more. That's not enough.
- No...

1652
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:40,967
But...

1653
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,535
(What?)

1654
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:43,937
- Regular plate.
- No, that's not enough.

1655
00:59:43,937 --> 00:59:46,072
(He got near the buffet plate.)

1656
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:48,208
(Why is he doing a somersault?)

1657
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,977
- Regular plate.
- Small dish.

1658
00:59:50,977 --> 00:59:54,647
(He goes back to where he belongs.)

1659
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:56,049
(I jumped far. Why am I here?)

1660
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:57,450
Goodness.

1661
00:59:58,051 --> 00:59:59,853
(This is why
it's called Greed Underworld.)

1662
00:59:59,853 --> 01:00:02,322
Small dish.

1663
01:00:02,622 --> 01:00:05,091
- It's a small dish.
- Why is nothing working out?

1664
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:08,728
- It's a small dish.
- It is.

1665
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:10,897
You landed on the small dish
in the end.

1666
01:00:10,897 --> 01:00:13,499
- It's a small dish.
- I...

1667
01:00:13,633 --> 01:00:15,568
So Min, do you want to go,
or should I go?

1668
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:17,170
- You should go.
- Okay.

1669
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,472
But Jae Suk is going to land
on the small dish.

1670
01:00:19,472 --> 01:00:21,641
He has a small heart.

1671
01:00:21,641 --> 01:00:23,209
He'll get a small dish too.

1672
01:00:23,209 --> 01:00:26,646
- He has good arm strength though.
- That's right. You never know.

1673
01:00:26,646 --> 01:00:29,515
All right. Regular plate.

1674
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:30,683
(What's going on with Jae Suk?)

1675
01:00:30,683 --> 01:00:32,452
The grasshopper is flying.

1676
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,787
He's flying.

1677
01:00:34,787 --> 01:00:36,689
- Good luck, Jae Suk.
- Good.

1678
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:39,359
- I think he can do it.
- Look at his face.

1679
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,897
(He jumps at the highest point.)

1680
01:00:44,864 --> 01:00:46,399
(His heels...)

1681
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:48,368
(land on the buffet plate.)

1682
01:00:48,368 --> 01:00:51,170
- He crossed it.
- He made it.

1683
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,941
(With a clean jump,
he lands on the buffet plate.)

1684
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:56,576
- He got it.
- He went over it.

1685
01:00:56,576 --> 01:00:58,678
- He went over it.
- I did this.

1686
01:00:58,678 --> 01:01:00,680
- My heels were on it.
- He went over it.

1687
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,248
Your heels were on it, so I accept.

1688
01:01:02,248 --> 01:01:03,917
Okay!

1689
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:07,186
Weren't we supposed to stand on it
for five seconds?

1690
01:01:07,186 --> 01:01:08,955
- Exactly.
- I'm going.

1691
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:11,958
- It's an advantage for Kwang Soo.
- There's too much advantage.

1692
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:15,995
- He has big feet.
- His feet can't touch.

1693
01:01:15,995 --> 01:01:17,030
All right.

1694
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:18,698
(I trust you, Kwang Soo.)

1695
01:01:20,266 --> 01:01:21,901
(Swinging)

1696
01:01:21,901 --> 01:01:24,103
- Your feet can't touch.
- They can't.

1697
01:01:24,103 --> 01:01:25,471
- Oh, dear.
- Wait.

1698
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:27,440
(Tickling)

1699
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,943
Wait. You can't do this.

1700
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:32,278
- Don't do that.
- Your feet can't touch.

1701
01:01:32,278 --> 01:01:34,547
- I said your feet can't touch.
- Take your time.

1702
01:01:34,547 --> 01:01:36,549
- Your feet can't touch.
- Take your time.

1703
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:38,918
- He's ticklish.
- Kwang Soo, your feet...

1704
01:01:38,918 --> 01:01:41,888
- You can't do this. Hold on.
- Kwang Soo...

1705
01:01:41,888 --> 01:01:44,357
(Kwang Soo falls
without getting a try.)

1706
01:01:44,357 --> 01:01:46,559
- Hold on. What do I do?
- Your feet can't touch.

1707
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:48,127
- You can't do that.
- It's a rule.

1708
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:50,396
- That's cheating.
- How's this a rule?

1709
01:01:50,396 --> 01:01:53,566
- I think he's really ticklish.
- Kwang Soo.

1710
01:01:53,566 --> 01:01:55,969
- He can endure it.
- He can.

1711
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:58,571
- I can try.
- If you can endure it, I accept.

1712
01:01:58,571 --> 01:02:00,440
- But I...
- Why would you fall?

1713
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,208
- I'll do the same as before.
- Do whatever.

1714
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,476
(He's confident.)

1715
01:02:03,476 --> 01:02:05,144
- We'll try it on him.
- Go ahead. I'm fine.

1716
01:02:05,144 --> 01:02:07,246
- Jong Kook.
- Do more.

1717
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:10,750
- I'm totally fine.
- See? He's fine.

1718
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:12,919
- He's fine.
- Do more.

1719
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:14,520
- I tickled him more.
- I'm totally fine.

1720
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,189
I feel like my nails will fall off,
so I can't do more.

1721
01:02:16,189 --> 01:02:17,590
(Suddenly)

1722
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:19,859
(He's mad.)

1723
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:21,728
(I don't know anymore.)

1724
01:02:22,862 --> 01:02:25,264
(The tiger's privacy gets exposed.)

1725
01:02:25,264 --> 01:02:27,266
- I'm mad.
- What are you doing?

1726
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:29,268
- You brat.
- What are you doing?

1727
01:02:29,268 --> 01:02:31,838
My bad.

1728
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:33,840
I'm so sorry. I got so mad.

1729
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,308
(Everybody gets awkward
all of a sudden.)

1730
01:02:35,308 --> 01:02:38,077
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

1731
01:02:38,077 --> 01:02:40,913
I'm sorry. I got so mad.

1732
01:02:40,913 --> 01:02:42,415
I'm so sorry.

1733
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:45,251
- Jong Kook.
- I'm sorry.

1734
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:48,921
Hey, So Min was in front of me.

1735
01:02:48,921 --> 01:02:50,556
She was right in front of me.

1736
01:02:50,556 --> 01:02:52,058
- Why are you sitting here?
- Hey.

1737
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:55,161
I didn't see it. I'm so unlucky.

1738
01:02:55,194 --> 01:02:57,730
Can you do it again?

1739
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,499
- I couldn't help it.
- Are you out of your mind?

1740
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:01,467
I was so mad
that I couldn't help it.

1741
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:04,270
- I'm sorry.
- You're out.

1742
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,439
(Kwang Soo and Jong Kook's teams
both fail the 1st attempt.)

1743
01:03:06,439 --> 01:03:08,608
- I'll go.
- Go ahead, Jong Kook.

1744
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:11,444
Sorry, but I have a trauma.

1745
01:03:11,444 --> 01:03:14,447
- What happened earlier...
- I'll stay far away.

1746
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:16,349
I'll stay far away.

1747
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:18,451
I have a trauma.

1748
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,420
- Go first, Jong Kook.
- Oh, gosh.

1749
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,789
- Don't do it again.
- He's focusing.

1750
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:25,625
You have to jump
farther than you think.

1751
01:03:25,625 --> 01:03:27,727
- Good luck, Jong Kook.
- You can do it.

1752
01:03:28,294 --> 01:03:29,729
You can do it, Jong Kook.

1753
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:32,732
(This is his last chance to overcome
the trauma and get a buffet plate.)

1754
01:03:32,732 --> 01:03:34,667
This is not easy.

1755
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:36,469
It's not easy to land on it.

1756
01:03:36,469 --> 01:03:37,870
(He's redetermined.
What's the result?)

1757
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:39,872
It's not easy to land on it.

1758
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,577
Okay, he's not even close.
It's here. It's a small dish.

1759
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:47,814
(His heels don't touch, and
his toes land on the small dish.)

1760
01:03:47,814 --> 01:03:49,415
It's a small dish.

1761
01:03:49,415 --> 01:03:51,350
It's a small dish for sure.

1762
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,619
You have to jump
farther than you think.

1763
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,556
- It's a small dish.
- Hey, what is wrong with you?

1764
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:58,057
You have to jump
farther than you think.

1765
01:03:58,057 --> 01:03:59,659
(Suk Jin and Jong Kook
get a small dish.)

1766
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:02,328
- Give it a try.
- Be serious.

1767
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:04,430
- You have to swing more.
- Let's go.

1768
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:06,933
- This is enough.
- The angle is tricky.

1769
01:04:06,933 --> 01:04:09,502
(Suk Jin's negative view
always brings the opposite result.)

1770
01:04:09,502 --> 01:04:14,040
(There's a good vibe.
Will he get a satisfying result?)

1771
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:18,744
Okay. It's perfect.

1772
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:19,979
(He lands inside the buffet area.)

1773
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:20,980
The angle is tricky.

1774
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,449
(It's a perfect landing.)

1775
01:04:23,449 --> 01:04:25,151
(It's perfect technique.)

1776
01:04:25,151 --> 01:04:27,987
It's perfect.

1777
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,990
- Do you approve? That looked cool.
- That was awesome.

1778
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,458
- That was amazing.
- He approves.

1779
01:04:32,458 --> 01:04:34,393
(Of course the staff approves.)

1780
01:04:34,393 --> 01:04:36,162
Did you do gymnastics?

1781
01:04:36,162 --> 01:04:37,897
(Haha and Se Chan's small dishes
get upgraded to buffet plates.)

1782
01:04:38,631 --> 01:04:40,800
Okay. We'll go too.

1783
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:43,035
- Kwang Soo.
- I'll go.

1784
01:04:43,035 --> 01:04:44,036
(Despite his superior physique,
he was retired by being tickled.)

1785
01:04:44,036 --> 01:04:45,938
- If your feet touch, it's over.
- He's serious.

1786
01:04:45,938 --> 01:04:48,975
- Kwang Soo...
- He can reach here.

1787
01:04:48,975 --> 01:04:50,977
(He swings with his entire body.)

1788
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,712
He looks serious.

1789
01:04:52,712 --> 01:04:53,946
He might go over it.

1790
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:55,648
(He's very serious.)

1791
01:04:55,648 --> 01:04:58,751
- Why are you creaking?
- Kwang Soo...

1792
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:01,087
- You'll get tired.
- You need to swing more.

1793
01:05:01,521 --> 01:05:04,357
He's getting lower.

1794
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:08,327
(His arms run out of energy.)

1795
01:05:09,095 --> 01:05:11,664
He's getting lower.

1796
01:05:11,664 --> 01:05:12,899
His feet touched.

1797
01:05:12,899 --> 01:05:14,700
(His feet touch,
and he's disqualified.)

1798
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,269
That's too low.

1799
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:17,837
(He had a good swing,)

1800
01:05:17,837 --> 01:05:20,907
(but he dragged himself.)

1801
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,708
(That's too low.)

1802
01:05:22,708 --> 01:05:24,377
That's too low!

1803
01:05:24,377 --> 01:05:25,645
(What am I supposed to do?)

1804
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:28,247
(He's too tall for the equipment,
so he's disqualified.)

1805
01:05:28,247 --> 01:05:29,815
- Other people's feet don't touch.
- It's okay.

1806
01:05:29,815 --> 01:05:31,717
- Their feet won't touch.
- It's over.

1807
01:05:31,717 --> 01:05:34,287
I tried to jump,

1808
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:35,955
but it stopped me!

1809
01:05:35,955 --> 01:05:37,790
It's over.

1810
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,258
- I tried to jump, but I stopped.
- It's over.

1811
01:05:39,258 --> 01:05:41,060
- Can they not eat?
- They can't.

1812
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,029
You should have made...

1813
01:05:43,095 --> 01:05:45,565
- It's over.
- Is it? Fine.

1814
01:05:45,565 --> 01:05:47,266
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

1815
01:05:47,266 --> 01:05:48,668
His feet touched.

1816
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:50,369
(Results from Fiery Pit of Greed)

1817
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:53,940
- They look so good.
- There's pork.

1818
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,875
- Oh, dear.
- This looks so good.

1819
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,210
Is that bulgogi?

1820
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,911
(The food is unlimited within the
allocated time using your plates.)

1821
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:01,214
- Is it our turn?
- That's pretty.

1822
01:06:01,214 --> 01:06:05,518
Time starts
when you pick up the first tong.

1823
01:06:05,518 --> 01:06:07,787
- All right. Is it seven seconds?
- It is.

1824
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:10,122
We can't eat at all.

1825
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:12,091
- So Min, we have to skip these.
- Ready,

1826
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:13,893
set, go.

1827
01:06:13,893 --> 01:06:14,927
What do you want?

1828
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,562
- Pork cutlet.
- Help him.

1829
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:18,631
- Help him, So Min.
- Dumplings, Jae Suk.

1830
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:20,700
- Dumplings. Jae Suk.
- Is it just one person?

1831
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,901
No, they can both do it.

1832
01:06:21,901 --> 01:06:23,936
(He was listening to So Min,
and 7 seconds are over.)

1833
01:06:23,936 --> 01:06:25,738
- It's done.
- Stop.

1834
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:27,873
- Take the last two out.
- So Min, why are you watching?

1835
01:06:27,873 --> 01:06:29,308
- You should have helped.
- No, only one person can do it.

1836
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:31,410
- That was it.
- That's right.

1837
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:34,080
- Is it just one person?
- Can't both do it?

1838
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,148
- Why did he do it alone?
- Why was she watching?

1839
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:37,850
- Come on.
- Wasn't it just one person?

1840
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,252
We thought it was one person,
so she didn't do it.

1841
01:06:39,252 --> 01:06:40,786
- Wasn't it one person?
- That's what she thought.

1842
01:06:40,786 --> 01:06:43,089
- That's your fault for not knowing.
- 10 seconds.

1843
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:45,958
- Let's take our time.
- Start.

1844
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:49,128
We could have done that too.

1845
01:06:49,362 --> 01:06:51,197
Come here. Move.

1846
01:06:51,197 --> 01:06:52,898
- Move.
- Hurry.

1847
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:54,767
You have to take that out.

1848
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:56,469
Take your hands off.

1849
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:58,537
Wait, what's that?

1850
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:00,706
Get away from it.

1851
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,208
We're next.

1852
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:04,577
I'm looking forward to this.
It's a small dish.

1853
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,245
Five seconds with the small dish.

1854
01:07:06,245 --> 01:07:07,847
- We can both do it, right?
- We can.

1855
01:07:07,847 --> 01:07:09,515
- We're starting. Get ready.
- Okay.

1856
01:07:09,515 --> 01:07:11,717
- Ready,
- Hold on.

1857
01:07:12,118 --> 01:07:13,853
- start.
- One...

1858
01:07:13,853 --> 01:07:15,721
(What?)

1859
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,557
(Are they putting a bowl
on top of the small dish?)

1860
01:07:18,557 --> 01:07:20,226
(No way.)

1861
01:07:20,226 --> 01:07:22,328
- Oh, dear.
- Get more.

1862
01:07:22,328 --> 01:07:23,396
Don't be greedy.

1863
01:07:23,396 --> 01:07:24,497
(5 seconds are over in shock.)

1864
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:25,831
You have to put that down.

1865
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,333
(That's plenty.)

1866
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:29,769
(He's satisfied.)

1867
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:31,170
- That's good.
- He did it.

1868
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,339
That was a great idea.

1869
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:35,007
They got the most.

1870
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:38,778
- That's shocking.
- This is our birthday.

1871
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:40,646
- This is a birthday cake.
- See?

1872
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:41,814
Amazing.

1873
01:07:41,814 --> 01:07:44,016
That's why I don't like
playing games with him.

1874
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:46,686
(He's sick of it.)

1875
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:47,887
Why not?

1876
01:07:47,887 --> 01:07:49,488
- Why?
- Why?

1877
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:51,257
It feels like we lost.

1878
01:07:51,624 --> 01:07:52,958
There's so much.

1879
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:54,327
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

1880
01:07:54,327 --> 01:07:56,329
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo starved,
and they have a job to do.)

1881
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:58,564
I'm confident.

1882
01:07:58,564 --> 01:08:00,933
- Do we start now?
- Yes.

1883
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:03,102
- Don't fall.
- Of course not.

1884
01:08:03,102 --> 01:08:04,870
- I trust you.
- Yes.

1885
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:08,140
(He's shocked.)

1886
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,876
(He can't speak.)

1887
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:12,111
Oh, gosh.

1888
01:08:12,111 --> 01:08:14,180
Stand up.

1889
01:08:14,747 --> 01:08:16,849
(The Queen had a lot to eat.)

1890
01:08:16,849 --> 01:08:18,317
Let's go.

1891
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,686
(That's our queen.)

1892
01:08:20,686 --> 01:08:23,789
It feels great to be
on Kwang Soo's back.

1893
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:26,726
Are you doing good, Queen of Death?

1894
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:29,562
- Yes, this is great.
- This is funny.

1895
01:08:29,562 --> 01:08:30,663
Thank you.

1896
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:33,399
(She doesn't know how he feels
and starts moving.)

1897
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:35,668
I'm lighter than you thought, right?
I'm as light as a feather.

1898
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:37,403
- Yes, I mean it.
- Kwang Soo.

1899
01:08:37,403 --> 01:08:38,738
- I'm as light as a feather, right?
- I swear.

1900
01:08:38,738 --> 01:08:40,573
- I swear.
- Push her up.

1901
01:08:40,573 --> 01:08:42,141
1, 2, 3.

1902
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:43,609
Push.

1903
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:45,978
(He almost saw real Grim Reapers
for a second.)

1904
01:08:45,978 --> 01:08:47,580
You're lighter than...

1905
01:08:48,047 --> 01:08:49,749
It's just hot.

1906
01:08:49,749 --> 01:08:50,783
It's like I'm on an elevator.

1907
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:52,718
This feels like
I'm on top of a tower.

1908
01:08:52,718 --> 01:08:54,387
I can see everything. This is wide.

1909
01:08:54,387 --> 01:08:55,454
(If there is a fiery pit,)

1910
01:08:55,454 --> 01:08:56,889
(this must be it.)

1911
01:08:56,889 --> 01:08:57,957
Your weight...

1912
01:08:57,957 --> 01:09:00,359
That's good. You can put me down.

1913
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,228
- Sorry?
- That's good.

1914
01:09:02,261 --> 01:09:03,929
- Do I put you down?
- No, not here.

1915
01:09:03,929 --> 01:09:06,365
- Why are you so sweaty, Kwang Soo?
- It's hot.

1916
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:08,801
(Shaking)

1917
01:09:08,801 --> 01:09:10,169
Oh, dear.

1918
01:09:10,169 --> 01:09:12,671
(We're here.)

1919
01:09:13,339 --> 01:09:15,408
I'm okay. I'm totally okay.

1920
01:09:15,841 --> 01:09:17,676
We came far.

1921
01:09:17,676 --> 01:09:19,712
(It looks like he went between
this world and the underworld.)

1922
01:09:19,812 --> 01:09:22,081
I saw a new side of you.

1923
01:09:22,181 --> 01:09:24,250
(Coughing)

1924
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:27,620
(I... I'm totally okay.)

1925
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,688
I'm really okay.

1926
01:09:30,022 --> 01:09:31,257
I'm really okay.

1927
01:09:31,257 --> 01:09:33,559
(What will happen to the deceased
and the Grim Reapers?)

1928
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:36,362
- What's this?
- What kind of underworld is this?

1929
01:09:36,362 --> 01:09:37,496
(They get to the final underworld.
Something is floating on the pool.)

1930
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:39,298
- Is this the last one?
- It is.

1931
01:09:39,298 --> 01:09:41,467
There are short and long ones.

1932
01:09:41,467 --> 01:09:43,202
(There are short and long weapons.
What's this underworld about?)

1933
01:09:43,202 --> 01:09:45,971
"The last trial will be held..."

1934
01:09:45,971 --> 01:09:47,740
"in Fist Underworld."

1935
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:49,208
(Final round: Fist Underworld)

1936
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:51,610
Fist Underworld.

1937
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:53,679
- "Fist Underworld"?
- Fists.

1938
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:55,147
Fists.

1939
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:58,017
There's only one person here
who uses his fists.

1940
01:09:58,017 --> 01:09:59,218
What do you mean?

1941
01:09:59,218 --> 01:10:00,920
- He's on the top.
- I don't use my fists.

1942
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,190
- He hit me earlier.
- What?

1943
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:07,026
He did this and thrusted at me.

1944
01:10:07,026 --> 01:10:08,961
- My arm almost fell off.
- He does that a lot.

1945
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:10,863
- That's a massage.
- He does that a lot.

1946
01:10:10,863 --> 01:10:13,666
Back in the day,
I don't know how things are now,

1947
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,234
but school bullies would...

1948
01:10:15,234 --> 01:10:17,470
punch you, and...

1949
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,472
- Right here.
- What did you say?

1950
01:10:19,472 --> 01:10:20,840
School bullies did that a lot.

1951
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,508
And only the bully found it funny.

1952
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,210
- They were entertained by it.
- Right.

1953
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,177
"Look at that."

1954
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:26,579
"That's the spot, right?"

1955
01:10:26,579 --> 01:10:28,681
"You'll be able to
move it less today."

1956
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:30,249
I think Jae Suk got that
done to him a lot.

1957
01:10:30,249 --> 01:10:32,017
- You are all laughing.
- I see.

1958
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:35,154
To best honest,
when it comes to fists,

1959
01:10:35,154 --> 01:10:36,989
(She's being honest.)

1960
01:10:36,989 --> 01:10:39,158
I can't deny it.

1961
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,695
- Right? Way back when...
- I know.

1962
01:10:42,695 --> 01:10:45,798
She's known for using her fists too.

1963
01:10:45,798 --> 01:10:47,666
I admit it,

1964
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,001
but Jong Kook is just as bad.

1965
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:50,836
- Why?
- You're almost as bad as me.

1966
01:10:50,836 --> 01:10:52,471
- Me?
- I think so.

1967
01:10:52,471 --> 01:10:54,039
So you take the smallest one.

1968
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:56,208
(She decides to give him
the smallest weapon.)

1969
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,877
The rest of you can take
the long ones.

1970
01:10:57,877 --> 01:10:59,512
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1971
01:10:59,512 --> 01:11:00,880
Do you admit it or not?

1972
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,748
- Do you admit it or not?
- The short one...

1973
01:11:02,748 --> 01:11:04,917
(Do you admit it or not?)

1974
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:05,918
Do you admit it or not?

1975
01:11:05,918 --> 01:11:07,386
Your fist...

1976
01:11:07,386 --> 01:11:09,221
She looks so natural
with the weapon.

1977
01:11:09,221 --> 01:11:11,991
You can't use the weapon.

1978
01:11:11,991 --> 01:11:14,627
- Just admit it already.
- I admit.

1979
01:11:14,627 --> 01:11:17,263
This is the final mission.

1980
01:11:17,263 --> 01:11:19,999
We'll start Floating Boxing.

1981
01:11:19,999 --> 01:11:21,600
"Floating Boxing"?

1982
01:11:21,901 --> 01:11:23,669
It's a tournament format
with two teams playing at a time.

1983
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:25,838
One person moves the float,

1984
01:11:25,838 --> 01:11:29,341
while the other person attacks
the opponent with their weapon.

1985
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:31,277
The team that makes the opponent
fall in the water wins.

1986
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:32,745
We got this.

1987
01:11:32,745 --> 01:11:34,747
You're tall,
so there's an advantage.

1988
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:36,448
You can attack from far away.

1989
01:11:37,349 --> 01:11:40,586
(This is their last chance
to collect Reincarnation Balls.)

1990
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:43,155
(When the whistle is blown
while they dance,)

1991
01:11:43,155 --> 01:11:45,758
(the first 2 teams to get the floats
get a match with each other.)

1992
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:49,628
(They dance and observe
at the same time.)

1993
01:11:49,628 --> 01:11:50,729
As long as
Jong Kook doesn't go on it.

1994
01:11:50,729 --> 01:11:53,365
(They all want to avoid him.)

1995
01:11:53,365 --> 01:11:56,769
(They're trying to get this float
and avoid Jong Kook.)

1996
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:58,270
(Round 1 of Floating Boxing starts.)

1997
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:00,205
Go on it.

1998
01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:01,307
(Se Chan gets on a float
as soon as the game starts.)

1999
01:12:01,307 --> 01:12:02,708
Se Chan.

2000
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:04,710
- Did he go on it?
- Don't go on yet. Watch Jong Kook.

2001
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:06,278
(They want anybody but Jong Kook
to go on the other one.)

2002
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:08,547
(He looks around and hesitates.)

2003
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:10,950
(Se Chan is better than Jong Kook.)

2004
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,118
- Did he go on it?
- Don't go on yet. Watch Jong Kook.

2005
01:12:13,852 --> 01:12:16,789
(I'll go on then.)

2006
01:12:16,789 --> 01:12:18,157
It's not bad to go first.

2007
01:12:18,157 --> 01:12:21,327
If we don't go on now,
we'll have to play Jong Kook.

2008
01:12:21,327 --> 01:12:23,228
(He avoided Jong Kook,
so that's a plus.)

2009
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:27,032
(The opponents have been set.)

2010
01:12:27,032 --> 01:12:28,067
Ready...

2011
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,169
(Team New Identity
versus Team Cheon Sung Im)

2012
01:12:30,169 --> 01:12:32,071
- Good luck.
- You have to direct me.

2013
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:33,505
It's shallow.

2014
01:12:33,505 --> 01:12:35,074
(There's tension in the air
for round one.)

2015
01:12:35,074 --> 01:12:36,942
(Splashing)

2016
01:12:36,942 --> 01:12:39,278
(They start cheating
like people of no class.)

2017
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:41,847
- Come on. Cut it out.
- They're splashing.

2018
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:43,282
Goodness.

2019
01:12:43,282 --> 01:12:45,351
(How messy.)

2020
01:12:45,351 --> 01:12:47,820
Look at those weaklings.

2021
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:49,321
Water punch.

2022
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,090
You need to use your weapons.

2023
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,524
Such cowards.

2024
01:12:52,524 --> 01:12:54,660
(Pushing)

2025
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:56,061
(Haha pushes it all of a sudden.)

2026
01:12:56,061 --> 01:12:57,930
What is he supposed to do?

2027
01:12:57,930 --> 01:12:59,365
Let's move back.

2028
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:00,866
Hold on.

2029
01:13:00,866 --> 01:13:02,368
(Why did you push it, Haha?)

2030
01:13:02,368 --> 01:13:04,737
Stop. I'm dizzy.

2031
01:13:05,137 --> 01:13:06,338
(Go back when I'm getting punched.)

2032
01:13:06,338 --> 01:13:08,307
What are you doing, Haha?

2033
01:13:08,307 --> 01:13:10,109
Go back when he's getting punched!

2034
01:13:10,943 --> 01:13:14,780
(There's a big difference
in the length of their arms.)

2035
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,049
(He keeps on getting hit,
and something occurs to him.)

2036
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:21,587
(Mother,
why did you make me so short?)

2037
01:13:21,587 --> 01:13:26,258
(It's the first time he's envious of
Kwang Soo's long arms.)

2038
01:13:26,258 --> 01:13:30,095
(His arms are short,
and the bigger problem...)

2039
01:13:30,095 --> 01:13:31,296
He keeps on getting hit.

2040
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:35,300
(is that Haha is a horrible driver.)

2041
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,137
Hold on, Haha. I keep getting hit.

2042
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:41,640
He moves back when Se Chan attacks
and stays still otherwise.

2043
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,808
He's Inspector Gadget.

2044
01:13:42,808 --> 01:13:44,276
(He stretches out his long arms.)

2045
01:13:44,276 --> 01:13:47,079
Oh, gosh.

2046
01:13:47,379 --> 01:13:51,950
(His face turns ugly
as he receives more punches.)

2047
01:13:52,685 --> 01:13:54,219
- Kwang Soo.
- My fist...

2048
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:56,889
(Se Chan's one last attack fails.)

2049
01:13:57,089 --> 01:14:01,060
(Sandbag Se Chan
falls in the water.)

2050
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:03,162
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo move on
to the final round.)

2051
01:14:03,162 --> 01:14:04,730
- Kwang Soo wins.
- Good job, Kwang Soo.

2052
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:05,998
(Haha is ashamed.)

2053
01:14:05,998 --> 01:14:07,032
Jong Kook will hit him
in the final round.

2054
01:14:07,032 --> 01:14:08,434
(He tries to comfort Se Chan.)

2055
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:10,836
(Are you kidding me?)

2056
01:14:10,836 --> 01:14:12,337
This game...

2057
01:14:12,604 --> 01:14:15,374
- makes the loser look ugly.
- One of them will go up?

2058
01:14:15,374 --> 01:14:18,410
- This is short, so...
- Give us the weapons.

2059
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:19,878
He's not within reach.

2060
01:14:19,878 --> 01:14:21,447
That's true.

2061
01:14:21,447 --> 01:14:24,283
So Min, you have to do good. Don't
go near him. He can't reach you.

2062
01:14:24,283 --> 01:14:25,417
Let's go.

2063
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,219
We have to stick
the floats together.

2064
01:14:27,219 --> 01:14:28,654
We'll do out boxing from far away.

2065
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:31,090
(In-fighter versus out-boxer)

2066
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:32,057
Bring it to the middle.

2067
01:14:32,057 --> 01:14:34,927
(They meet on a single bridge.
Who will be the winner?)

2068
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,628
Don't stick to him. Move back.

2069
01:14:36,628 --> 01:14:38,931
- Hold on.
- Move back, So Min.

2070
01:14:39,264 --> 01:14:40,499
Hit him.

2071
01:14:40,499 --> 01:14:43,335
(He moves back
and hits with his long weapon.)

2072
01:14:43,335 --> 01:14:44,570
(You call that a punch?)

2073
01:14:44,570 --> 01:14:46,138
- He dodged.
- Move back.

2074
01:14:46,138 --> 01:14:47,706
- He dodged.
- Use the entire space.

2075
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,007
It's boxing.

2076
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:50,876
(How do I beat him?)

2077
01:14:50,876 --> 01:14:53,479
Ugly Man, 1, 2.

2078
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:55,748
Was that an attack?

2079
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:57,049
(Jae Suk is cornered.
What is he supposed to do?)

2080
01:14:57,049 --> 01:14:58,050
Take this.

2081
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,518
(He splashes water
at Jong Kook's eyes.)

2082
01:14:59,518 --> 01:15:01,920
(The cheater starts to play dirty.)

2083
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,189
You were criticizing them earlier
for splashing water.

2084
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:05,958
We're all the same.

2085
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,359
Stick the floats together.

2086
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:09,128
Hey, take this.

2087
01:15:09,128 --> 01:15:10,496
What are you doing?

2088
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:12,131
(He punishes So Min
for the dirty play.)

2089
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:13,298
It's too short.

2090
01:15:13,298 --> 01:15:14,700
Suk Jin, you need to
change the direction.

2091
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:16,001
You have to come this way.

2092
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:17,736
(Hitting)

2093
01:15:17,736 --> 01:15:19,238
Come back.

2094
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:20,439
Why are you hitting me?

2095
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:22,141
(Jae Suk hits Suk Jin
out of nowhere.)

2096
01:15:22,141 --> 01:15:25,210
(Why are you hitting me?)

2097
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:27,946
(He distracts them
by attacking Suk Jin...)

2098
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:29,114
Go for it.

2099
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:30,215
(and attempts
to attack Jong Kook.)

2100
01:15:30,215 --> 01:15:31,283
Good job.

2101
01:15:31,283 --> 01:15:33,418
(Try to hit me if you can.)

2102
01:15:34,253 --> 01:15:35,788
Where are you taking me?

2103
01:15:35,788 --> 01:15:36,822
Let's go.

2104
01:15:36,822 --> 01:15:38,190
(The out-boxer gets cornered again.)

2105
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,058
- Hold on properly. He's cornered.
- Move back, So Min.

2106
01:15:40,058 --> 01:15:42,027
He's cornered.

2107
01:15:42,261 --> 01:15:46,298
(There's nowhere to hide.
This is war now.)

2108
01:15:46,298 --> 01:15:47,332
Hit his face, Jae Suk.

2109
01:15:47,332 --> 01:15:52,371
(He tries to get out of trouble
by being annoying.)

2110
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:54,873
(If he takes too long,
he might lose.)

2111
01:15:54,873 --> 01:15:58,076
(Jong Kook moves
to the other float.)

2112
01:15:58,076 --> 01:16:01,780
(In-fighter Jong Kook tries to
get on the other float.)

2113
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:05,250
(He decides to fight close-up.
What is the result?)

2114
01:16:05,717 --> 01:16:07,085
(Hitting)

2115
01:16:07,085 --> 01:16:08,954
(Jae Suk gains victory!)

2116
01:16:08,954 --> 01:16:12,558
(When Jong Kook lost balance,
Jae Suk pushed him slightly.)

2117
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:14,626
(There's nobody you cannot defeat.)

2118
01:16:14,626 --> 01:16:16,728
Goodness. How could this be?

2119
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:19,097
How could this be?

2120
01:16:19,932 --> 01:16:21,567
Didn't you get lucky?

2121
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:23,135
- What do you mean?
- He just got lucky.

2122
01:16:23,135 --> 01:16:24,703
- He did it.
- It's okay.

2123
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,705
I overcame a big obstacle.

2124
01:16:26,705 --> 01:16:28,006
That's so true.

2125
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:29,508
(Team Ugly Man overcomes
the huge obstacle and advances.)

2126
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:32,177
(Team New Identity versus
Team Prosecutor for 3rd place)

2127
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:34,947
We'll play each other.

2128
01:16:35,180 --> 01:16:36,348
Bring it on.

2129
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:39,718
(This is going to be a cute match.)

2130
01:16:39,718 --> 01:16:41,286
Mapo Cotton Punch...

2131
01:16:41,286 --> 01:16:43,455
and Suyu-ri Honey Punch
finally meet.

2132
01:16:43,455 --> 01:16:44,756
I'm so curious
how this will turn out.

2133
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:47,326
- I'll make sure you don't get hit.
- This is going to be the highlight.

2134
01:16:47,326 --> 01:16:48,861
This is a battle
between a spear and a shield.

2135
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:51,330
(Do you remember?
We created all those highlights.)

2136
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:55,801
(They're both bad, so their battles
were always sorrowful to watch.)

2137
01:16:55,801 --> 01:17:00,005
(They were both winners back then,
but the loser gets decided today.)

2138
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:01,340
What? Look at me.

2139
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,341
Are you intimidated?

2140
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:04,176
("Dang Diggi Bang" plays
for the super match.)

2141
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:05,811
You have to do this.

2142
01:17:05,811 --> 01:17:07,246
(Here it goes again.)

2143
01:17:07,246 --> 01:17:08,747
I'm sick of this.

2144
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:12,551
(Get your reggae swag ready.)

2145
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:17,289
(His dance is as fierce as ever.)

2146
01:17:17,289 --> 01:17:18,991
Dance, dance.

2147
01:17:18,991 --> 01:17:20,058
(It's a fun reggae party
in the underworld.)

2148
01:17:20,058 --> 01:17:23,428
(He shows his passion
in the highlight.)

2149
01:17:23,428 --> 01:17:25,197
(Whistling)

2150
01:17:25,597 --> 01:17:27,366
Hold on. He exhausted his energy.

2151
01:17:27,366 --> 01:17:29,401
- You have a chance of winning.
- Get up here.

2152
01:17:29,401 --> 01:17:31,370
Even if you have a short glove,
you have a chance of winning.

2153
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:34,072
My goodness, there he goes.

2154
01:17:34,072 --> 01:17:35,207
Go to the left.

2155
01:17:35,207 --> 01:17:36,208
Stick out your glove.

2156
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:38,277
I am a big fan of their fight.

2157
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:44,549
(Haha throw punches
with his long weapon.)

2158
01:17:44,549 --> 01:17:46,318
He became lively.

2159
01:17:46,318 --> 01:17:47,419
(What is this liveliness?)

2160
01:17:47,419 --> 01:17:49,087
Know that my punches will hurt.

2161
01:17:49,087 --> 01:17:50,489
(Let's put an end to this rivalry.)

2162
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:52,157
He is determined.

2163
01:17:52,157 --> 01:17:53,325
(Smacking)

2164
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:55,427
(Haha hits Suk Jin in the stomach.)

2165
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:57,062
My goodness.

2166
01:17:57,596 --> 01:17:59,531
Suk Jin has no chance of winning.

2167
01:17:59,731 --> 01:18:01,099
(I am scared. Stop it.)

2168
01:18:01,099 --> 01:18:02,768
Don't hit so hard.

2169
01:18:02,768 --> 01:18:04,269
Can't you see this?

2170
01:18:04,303 --> 01:18:08,440
(Suk Jin is at a disadvantage
in both spirit and weapon.)

2171
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,078
(He attempts a close combat.)

2172
01:18:13,078 --> 01:18:16,648
(Let's see if Suk Jin's attack
will be a success.)

2173
01:18:16,648 --> 01:18:18,817
(His legs are short as well.)

2174
01:18:18,817 --> 01:18:19,985
Okay!

2175
01:18:19,985 --> 01:18:24,523
(He goes into the water,)

2176
01:18:24,523 --> 01:18:26,458
(not onto the float.)

2177
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,893
Okay!

2178
01:18:28,593 --> 01:18:30,996
(Team Prosecutor comes in last...)

2179
01:18:30,996 --> 01:18:34,199
(and Team New Identity
comes in 3rd.)

2180
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:36,168
- Let's go.
- This is the final match.

2181
01:18:36,168 --> 01:18:37,169
Okay.

2182
01:18:37,169 --> 01:18:38,837
(Team Ugly Man
versus Team Cheon Sung Im)

2183
01:18:38,837 --> 01:18:40,005
(It's a match
between the female members.)

2184
01:18:40,005 --> 01:18:41,239
- I've never seen this before.
- We've never seen this before.

2185
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:43,208
- This is the first time, right?
- Yes.

2186
01:18:43,241 --> 01:18:45,377
- Do this right.
- Let's go.

2187
01:18:45,377 --> 01:18:46,678
I have no idea who will win.

2188
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,080
- That picture makes this scarier.
- Ji Hyo is strong.

2189
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,247
This is the final.

2190
01:18:49,247 --> 01:18:50,449
Ji Hyo is strong.

2191
01:18:50,449 --> 01:18:51,917
This is Ji Hyo's past.

2192
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:54,086
(It's hard to meet eyes
with the woman in the picture.)

2193
01:18:54,086 --> 01:18:56,621
Look at that hairstyle. She's scary.

2194
01:18:56,621 --> 01:18:57,756
It's a delinquent's hairstyle.

2195
01:18:57,756 --> 01:18:59,391
- Get ready.
- Look at the picture.

2196
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:01,660
(The war between the queens starts.)

2197
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,694
She has a chance.

2198
01:19:02,694 --> 01:19:04,363
That was strong.

2199
01:19:04,363 --> 01:19:05,630
My goodness.

2200
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,899
(Ji Hyo lands a strong punch first.)

2201
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:09,368
She has a chance.

2202
01:19:09,601 --> 01:19:12,270
- Stab her.
- You can do this.

2203
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:14,539
So Min is intimidated.
I can tell from her face.

2204
01:19:15,007 --> 01:19:16,508
So Min, go.

2205
01:19:16,508 --> 01:19:18,677
(So Min counterattacks,
but Ji Hyo blocks it with her hand.)

2206
01:19:18,677 --> 01:19:21,480
(So Min,
you can't win against me.)

2207
01:19:22,047 --> 01:19:24,416
(She attacks
when So Min is staggering.)

2208
01:19:24,416 --> 01:19:26,818
- So Min, go.
- Get her off of the float.

2209
01:19:26,818 --> 01:19:28,453
- Ji Hyo.
- Get me closer.

2210
01:19:28,453 --> 01:19:29,755
- Get me closer.
- I will do that.

2211
01:19:29,755 --> 01:19:31,857
Jae Suk, let's run away.

2212
01:19:33,058 --> 01:19:35,627
- My goodness.
- Run away.

2213
01:19:35,627 --> 01:19:36,628
Corner her.

2214
01:19:36,628 --> 01:19:39,498
So Min, jump over to her float
if everything fails.

2215
01:19:39,498 --> 01:19:41,400
(So Min, jump over to her float
if everything fails.)

2216
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,668
(Se Chan is right.)

2217
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:46,338
(This isn't working.)

2218
01:19:46,938 --> 01:19:48,006
Attack!

2219
01:19:48,006 --> 01:19:51,576
(It's time for a close combat.)

2220
01:19:51,576 --> 01:19:55,147
(You can do this, So Min.)

2221
01:19:55,147 --> 01:19:56,648
Attack!

2222
01:19:56,848 --> 01:19:58,617
(Is she stretching her legs?)

2223
01:19:58,617 --> 01:20:00,452
(She plops into the water.)

2224
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:02,921
(Her ambitious attempt
ends as a slapstick comedy.)

2225
01:20:02,921 --> 01:20:04,523
(This isn't what I had in mind.)

2226
01:20:04,523 --> 01:20:05,557
So Min lost.

2227
01:20:05,557 --> 01:20:07,459
I thought So Min's legs would rip.

2228
01:20:07,459 --> 01:20:09,494
So Min, are you okay?

2229
01:20:09,494 --> 01:20:12,998
(The lively and funny
final match ends.)

2230
01:20:12,998 --> 01:20:14,166
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

2231
01:20:14,166 --> 01:20:15,667
You fell face-first into the water.

2232
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:17,769
She was like Jong Kook.

2233
01:20:17,903 --> 01:20:19,137
(The female Kim Jong Kook wins
20 Reincarnation Balls.)

2234
01:20:19,137 --> 01:20:20,572
Ji Hyo is really strong.

2235
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:21,706
Seriously.

2236
01:20:21,706 --> 01:20:22,941
Her strength rivals that of a man.

2237
01:20:22,941 --> 01:20:25,110
(Team Cheon Sung In has 40,
Team Ugly Man has 30,)

2238
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:26,678
(Team New Identity has 20,
and Team Prosecutors has 5.)

2239
01:20:26,678 --> 01:20:29,281
Here are the Reincarnation Balls
you have collected.

2240
01:20:29,281 --> 01:20:31,083
Put the Reincarnation Balls
in a machine for a lottery.

2241
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:32,784
A team reincarnates
when its ball comes out.

2242
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:36,088
If the chosen team's ball
comes out again,

2243
01:20:36,088 --> 01:20:37,489
it's a lost chance
for the other teams.

2244
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:38,590
(Then the lottery moves on
to the next round.)

2245
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,126
A single team might get chosen
three times in a row.

2246
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:42,928
In that case,
only one team will be saved.

2247
01:20:42,928 --> 01:20:45,163
Team Prosecutor
doesn't have a chance.

2248
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:47,165
- There are three chances, right?
- Yes.

2249
01:20:47,165 --> 01:20:48,333
You never know.

2250
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:50,202
That's right. We should have hope.

2251
01:20:50,202 --> 01:20:52,471
- Please.
- I don't see my name anywhere.

2252
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:53,738
It says, "Prosecutors".

2253
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:56,007
- Really?
- 1 to 3 teams will get chosen.

2254
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:57,409
- That's right.
- All right.

2255
01:20:57,642 --> 01:20:58,777
Let's go.

2256
01:20:58,777 --> 01:20:59,845
Hold on.

2257
01:20:59,845 --> 01:21:01,179
Please press the button.

2258
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:02,581
Press it gently.

2259
01:21:02,581 --> 01:21:04,549
- Press it gently.
- It came out!

2260
01:21:04,549 --> 01:21:05,717
- It came out.
- It came out.

2261
01:21:05,717 --> 01:21:06,885
- Whose name is on it?
- I didn't see it.

2262
01:21:06,885 --> 01:21:07,886
I didn't see it either.

2263
01:21:07,886 --> 01:21:09,955
(If the deceased's name is on it,
both team members reincarnate.)

2264
01:21:09,955 --> 01:21:12,090
- The first team to reincarnate...
- Which team is it?

2265
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:13,358
On which side is the team?

2266
01:21:13,358 --> 01:21:15,494
(On which side is the team?)

2267
01:21:15,494 --> 01:21:17,195
Okay!

2268
01:21:17,195 --> 01:21:18,797
- It's on that side.
- That side?

2269
01:21:18,797 --> 01:21:19,865
It could be us.

2270
01:21:19,865 --> 01:21:21,032
- Do you want to know?
- Yes.

2271
01:21:21,032 --> 01:21:23,869
(Which team is
on the first Reincarnation Ball?)

2272
01:21:23,869 --> 01:21:25,437
Song Ji Hyo!

2273
01:21:25,437 --> 01:21:27,205
(Song Ji Hyo)

2274
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:30,075
(Thanks to the lucky Ji Hyo,)

2275
01:21:30,075 --> 01:21:32,677
(even the unlucky Grim Reaper
reincarnates.)

2276
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:34,379
Will the next ball belong
to Ji Hyo as well?

2277
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:37,048
We are done!

2278
01:21:37,282 --> 01:21:38,416
It's time to pick the second ball.

2279
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:39,417
(It's time to pick the second ball.)

2280
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:41,019
If Ji Hyo's ball comes out again...

2281
01:21:41,019 --> 01:21:43,522
- Please.
- Haha! Haha!

2282
01:21:43,522 --> 01:21:45,690
- Please.
- Jae Suk.

2283
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,459
All right. Push.

2284
01:21:47,459 --> 01:21:51,596
(If Ji Hyo's ball comes out again,
other teams lose their chance.)

2285
01:21:51,596 --> 01:21:53,598
(Team Ugly Man has
30 Reincarnation Balls.)

2286
01:21:53,598 --> 01:21:55,300
Please let it be us.

2287
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,334
Team Prosecutors.

2288
01:21:56,334 --> 01:21:59,171
(Team Prosecutors has
5 Reincarnation Balls.)

2289
01:21:59,171 --> 01:22:00,505
Yoo Jae Suk!

2290
01:22:00,505 --> 01:22:02,941
(Yoo Jae Suk)

2291
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,009
(They reincarnate
with 30 Reincarnation Balls.)

2292
01:22:04,009 --> 01:22:05,177
- No way.
- Congratulations.

2293
01:22:05,177 --> 01:22:06,978
- Did a different ball come out?
- We reincarnated.

2294
01:22:07,212 --> 01:22:08,847
For goodness' sake.

2295
01:22:09,047 --> 01:22:11,917
- Did that really happen?
- Let's go this way.

2296
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:13,818
(I wish I had won
more Reincarnation Balls.)

2297
01:22:13,818 --> 01:22:16,288
We should have won in the last game.

2298
01:22:16,288 --> 01:22:17,789
Let us tell you
when to press the button.

2299
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:19,291
- When we say, "Now!"
- We have a good feeling about this.

2300
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,625
- Okay.
- Sure.

2301
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:21,826
(Let's try anything we can.)

2302
01:22:21,826 --> 01:22:23,295
The last team will be chosen.

2303
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:24,829
Let's go.

2304
01:22:25,063 --> 01:22:26,531
- I love you.
- I love you.

2305
01:22:26,531 --> 01:22:28,166
- Haha.
- In 1, 2, 3.

2306
01:22:28,166 --> 01:22:29,167
- Stop!
- Stop!

2307
01:22:29,167 --> 01:22:30,802
(This is it.)

2308
01:22:30,802 --> 01:22:32,037
- Okay.
- Okay, it's stopped.

2309
01:22:32,037 --> 01:22:33,371
You were a bit late.

2310
01:22:33,371 --> 01:22:35,207
The timing was off.

2311
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:37,309
- That wasn't very clean.
- It was a bit off.

2312
01:22:37,309 --> 01:22:41,046
You stopped the machine.

2313
01:22:41,046 --> 01:22:42,647
Why did they get to stop
the machine?

2314
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:43,915
- We have 20 Reincarnation Balls.
- Do you want to do it?

2315
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:45,517
- Do it.
- You should do it then.

2316
01:22:45,517 --> 01:22:46,651
(While the two teams are arguing...)

2317
01:22:46,651 --> 01:22:47,919
You already did it.

2318
01:22:47,919 --> 01:22:49,120
Shall we do it again?

2319
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,622
If it's one of the chosen teams...

2320
01:22:50,622 --> 01:22:51,957
It isn't.

2321
01:22:51,957 --> 01:22:54,359
It's not one of the chosen teams.

2322
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:56,595
(It's either Team New Identity
or Team Prosecutors.)

2323
01:22:56,595 --> 01:22:58,530
- Really?
- Is it one of us?

2324
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,031
Queen of Death.

2325
01:23:00,031 --> 01:23:01,600
(In Queen of Death's hands...)

2326
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,637
(lies the fate
of the last chosen team.)

2327
01:23:05,637 --> 01:23:08,607
(20 Reincarnation Balls
versus 5 Reincarnation Balls)

2328
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:11,243
Haha!

2329
01:23:11,243 --> 01:23:12,911
- No way!
- Are you serious?

2330
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:17,649
(Probability saves
Team New Identity.)

2331
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,417
(All teams with the deceased
reincarnate.)

2332
01:23:19,417 --> 01:23:21,586
- For real?
- All the deceased were chosen.

2333
01:23:21,586 --> 01:23:23,521
(All teams with the deceased
reincarnate.)

2334
01:23:23,755 --> 01:23:25,657
My goodness.

2335
01:23:25,657 --> 01:23:27,259
We all got reincarnated.

2336
01:23:27,259 --> 01:23:28,727
All the deceased got to reincarnate.

2337
01:23:28,727 --> 01:23:30,128
(What's the penalty?)

2338
01:23:31,096 --> 01:23:33,365
Since the prosecutors failed
to reincarnate,

2339
01:23:33,365 --> 01:23:36,167
they must gather
three drops of tears of repentance.

2340
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:37,535
Do they need to cry?

2341
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:39,237
Will this make us cry?

2342
01:23:39,237 --> 01:23:41,239
We will cry in no time.

2343
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:43,108
Open your eyes wide.

2344
01:23:43,108 --> 01:23:45,176
- I am not sure about this.
- Since we are tired,

2345
01:23:45,176 --> 01:23:46,745
we will shed tears in no time.

2346
01:23:46,745 --> 01:23:49,447
(He puts the onion near his eyes.)

2347
01:23:49,447 --> 01:23:50,649
Will this make me shed tears?

2348
01:23:50,649 --> 01:23:53,285
Maybe your eyes are too dry.

2349
01:23:53,285 --> 01:23:55,887
(Jong Kook is in tears already.)

2350
01:23:55,887 --> 01:23:57,455
I think it went in.

2351
01:23:57,455 --> 01:23:59,891
Big drops of tears fell just now.
Look.

2352
01:24:00,692 --> 01:24:01,993
They are falling.

2353
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,995
I can't see it.

2354
01:24:03,995 --> 01:24:04,996
- Look at this.
- You are shedding tears.

2355
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:06,498
They are falling, right?

2356
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:09,801
Mom!

2357
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,137
(Mother, I promise
to reincarnate into a good son.)

2358
01:24:12,137 --> 01:24:13,838
Mom!

2359
01:24:13,838 --> 01:24:15,540
I am going to think
about something sad.

2360
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,410
I am going to think
about parting ways with my wife.

2361
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:20,445
Suk Jin, you look too happy.

2362
01:24:20,445 --> 01:24:24,049
(Suk Jin, you look too happy.)

2363
01:24:24,049 --> 01:24:25,250
(I am not really laughing.)

2364
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,319
Suk Jin, you look too happy.

2365
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:28,787
No, it's sad.

2366
01:24:28,787 --> 01:24:30,955
The idea of parting ways
with my wife is really sad.

2367
01:24:30,955 --> 01:24:32,257
(Laughing)

2368
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:35,694
(He is so sad
that he lost his mind.)

2369
01:24:35,694 --> 01:24:36,928
It's sad.

2370
01:24:36,928 --> 01:24:37,996
Does thinking about it
make you happy?

2371
01:24:37,996 --> 01:24:39,331
No, it's heartbreaking.

2372
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:41,666
It's unthinkable.

2373
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:43,468
(I am sure you will know
how I feel if you get married.)

2374
01:24:43,768 --> 01:24:47,138
- I think it's working.
- I gathered a lot of tears.

2375
01:24:47,138 --> 01:24:49,007
Look at this, Suk Jin.

2376
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:50,241
(Jong Kook quickly succeeds
to gather three drops of tears.)

2377
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:51,776
- You've succeeded.
- Aren't those just two drops?

2378
01:24:51,776 --> 01:24:52,877
- Okay!
- I am in tears, right?

2379
01:24:52,877 --> 01:24:54,245
Okay!

2380
01:24:54,245 --> 01:24:57,182
Tears won't come out.
This is driving me crazy.

2381
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,752
You have no emotions.

2382
01:25:00,752 --> 01:25:02,287
You must be a robot.

2383
01:25:02,287 --> 01:25:03,488
(He even puts the onion on his eye.)

2384
01:25:03,488 --> 01:25:04,956
Why won't my tears come out?

2385
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:06,324
That's so strange.

2386
01:25:06,324 --> 01:25:08,059
Why won't your tears come out?

2387
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:13,098
(Suk Jin struggles with the onions
until late at night.)

2388
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:15,333
(Next week)

2389
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:18,269
(Suk Jin gets a question.)
Truth or dare?

2390
01:25:18,636 --> 01:25:20,705
(I choose dare.)

2391
01:25:20,705 --> 01:25:23,007
(Ji Suk Jin is out.)

2392
01:25:23,007 --> 01:25:24,242
Am I really out?

2393
01:25:24,242 --> 01:25:27,178
(Suk Jin is out after
only 20 minutes into the shoot.)

2394
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:28,546
Is he out?

2395
01:25:28,546 --> 01:25:30,382
(Also,)

2396
01:25:30,682 --> 01:25:32,584
(they get locked...)

2397
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:35,353
(inside a room.)

2398
01:25:35,353 --> 01:25:37,288
(There is only one way to escape.)

2399
01:25:37,288 --> 01:25:39,057
(Truth or dare)

2400
01:25:39,057 --> 01:25:43,528
(The tantalizing truth
they want to hide)

2401
01:25:43,862 --> 01:25:47,899
