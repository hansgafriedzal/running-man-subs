1
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:07,430
(Last week)

2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,700
(Couple Race with the special guests heated up the atmosphere.)

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,870
(The 8 guests and 8 members were paired up.)

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,000
(Ji Hyo and Bobby, Kwang Soo and Elijah, Seok Jin and Ji Min,)

5
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,030
(Jae Seok and Xi A, Haha and Sun Mi, Jong Kook and Ju Yeon,)

6
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,670
(Se Chan and B.I, and So Min and Seung Ri)

7
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:21,465
(The guests showed their charms and lengthened the opening.)

8
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:26,065
(They plan to show their charms for real this week.)

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,980
(White Skull Infantry Division, are you watching this?)

10
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,975
(The show that doesn't hold back begins now.)

11
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:33,250
(The hot guests deserve a lengthy introduction.)

12
00:00:33,256 --> 00:00:35,405
It's Lee Elijah's turn next.

13
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:37,160
- It's finally her turn. - It's finally her turn.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,660
(She is like a part of the Running Man family.)

15
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:42,730
Elijah, you got paired up with Kwang Soo.

16
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:46,815
What does the agency think of Kwang Soo?

17
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:47,900
(Laughing)

18
00:00:47,904 --> 00:00:50,600
- Please be honest. - That's right.

19
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:52,555
Tell us.

20
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:55,610
- What is it? - Prince.

21
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,640
- Prince? - Prince of Asia?

22
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:01,435
Does the agency think of him as the Prince of Asia?

23
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,675
I don't know him very well.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,620
(She gives up on giving a statement.)

25
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:09,520
You should make something up!

26
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,160
Don't get angry.

27
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,460
- I mean... - You two aren't close.

28
00:01:13,463 --> 00:01:15,630
- You're really not. - I mean...

29
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:17,500
Not even strangers would do that.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,730
- She should make something up. - Seriously.

31
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,900
They're worse than strangers.

32
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:25,440
What is Elijah's image within the agency?

33
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,440
- Please be honest, Kwang Soo. - That's right.

34
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:28,940
- What did you hear? - What is it?

35
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,695
Even before I met Elijah on Running Man,

36
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:37,550
(How does a fellow celebrity in her agency see Elijah?)

37
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:39,480
I heard that she is really crazy.

38
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:41,820
- That can't be true. - I heard that she is really unique.

39
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:44,160
You heard that she is unique. Is it wrong, Elijah?

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,790
- Of course it is. - Both So Min and Ju Yeon...

41
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:49,290
- are crazy. - Crazy people are unaware.

42
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,730
- That's right. - How am I crazy?

43
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:52,000
Everyone else knows...

44
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,100
- except for them. - I am really not crazy.

45
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:58,140
Up next is E Xi A.

46
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,725
I can't wait.

47
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,495
I can't wait.

48
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:05,080
- I can't wait. - Like I told you before,

49
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,050
Xi A was a member of a girl group in 2012.

50
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,650
- As a member of Chi Chi, - Right.

51
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:12,680
she worked mostly in Japan.

52
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:14,750
What does Chi Chi mean?

53
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:18,360
It was an acronym for creative electronic house idol.

54
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,830
In Japanese, Chi Chi means chest.

55
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,190
(However...)

56
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,830
- Really? - Yes. It was embarrassing.

57
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,370
Her words made me solemn.

58
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:30,970
We don't know how to react to that.

59
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,340
- It just happened that way. - Yes.

60
00:02:32,342 --> 00:02:33,970
- You must have been shocked. - Yes.

61
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:36,010
- How did that happen? - We used to have...

62
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,980
a member called Gary. Gary means diarrhea...

63
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,310
in Japanese.

64
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:42,010
(Diarrhea is our friend.)

65
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:45,280
Something like that can happen...

66
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:48,050
- Seriously? - by pure chance.

67
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:51,360
- In that case, - Let's see Chi Chi's performance.

68
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:53,460
show us Chi Chi's performance.

69
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:56,360
- Let's go. - The dance is really cute.

70
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,585
I am too old for this.

71
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:00,525
She is cute.

72
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,370
Let's see Chi Chi's performance.

73
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:05,700
(She takes the stage as a member of Chi Chi.)

74
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:09,065
(She transforms.)

75
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,810
(She turns on the switch for a girl group member's face.)

76
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:15,135
(She is confident.)

77
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:18,305
She is incredible.

78
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,890
- Do you know this song? - Yes, I do. I remember it.

79
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:23,345
(There is no way this isn't the crazy girl special.)

80
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,320
- Do you know this song? - I know this song.

81
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,890
I remember it.

82
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:31,060
(Without hesitation, she gives a professional performance.)

83
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,900
She is good.

84
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:34,870
- Her body remembers. - Give her a round of applause.

85
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,270
Isn't she great?

86
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,870
(After shaking her body,)

87
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,570
(she goes back to her place.)

88
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,240
- She is good. - She is good.

89
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,965
- She can dance well. - She is cool.

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,910
- You were surprised, right? - I got goosebumps.

91
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:48,880
- Forget about "Mr. Sunshine". - She's completely different.

92
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,450
- She is a different person. - She really is a different person.

93
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,835
Sexy!

94
00:03:52,288 --> 00:03:54,490
He keeps going, "Sexy!"

95
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,690
- "Sexy!" - I thought I was hearing things.

96
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:59,290
Even when Seung Ri danced, he shouted, "Sexy!"

97
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,430
He keeps going, "Sexy!"

98
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,460
(Even when Seung Ri danced...)

99
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,060
(Sexy!)

100
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:04,700
(Even when So Min danced...)

101
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,500
(Sexy!)

102
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:10,625
(B.I's automatic reaction involves shouting, "Sexy!")

103
00:04:11,307 --> 00:04:12,870
- He keeps going, "Sexy!" - Are you trying to make it a thing?

104
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:14,810
- Are you trying to make it a thing? - No, I am not.

105
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,240
- They are sexy. - Sexy.

106
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,810
In an interview, you said that Running Man was a program...

107
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:22,550
- you'd want to be in. - That's right.

108
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:25,250
Really? Although we haven't gotten started in earnest,

109
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,690
how does it feel to be here? Is it nerve-wracking?

110
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,360
- It's really fun. - What was the most fun?

111
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,990
Because Kwang Soo looks exactly like my brother,

112
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,845
I can't help but laugh every time I see him.

113
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:37,615
I can't help but laugh every time I see him.

114
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,860
- Does your brother look like him? - Yes.

115
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:41,800
He looks exactly like my brother.

116
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:42,870
- Really? - Yes.

117
00:04:42,872 --> 00:04:45,240
- Does your brother look like him? - Really?

118
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,440
How can a man with a sister like her look like him?

119
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:50,010
There is a resemblance. Their mouths look similar.

120
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:52,740
Does your brother have a nickname?

121
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,810
Kwang Soo.

122
00:04:53,816 --> 00:04:56,305
(Her brother's nickname is Kwang Soo.)

123
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,250
Does your brother like the nickname?

124
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:00,950
- No, he doesn't. - He doesn't.

125
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,675
(He doesn't like the nickname.)

126
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:06,345
What is going on? I was just standing here.

127
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,360
- I was just standing here. - They look the same.

128
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:12,300
- So... - She is laughing at my face.

129
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:15,200
- What is your brother's name? - They look the same.

130
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:17,570
- His name is E Jang Gi. - Jang Gi?

131
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:20,070
Jang Gi?

132
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,510
- Jang Gi? - E Jang Gi.

133
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,810
- E Jang Gi. - Jang Gi?

134
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:25,310
- Jang Gi? - Is his name Jang Gi?

135
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:27,880
- What a coincidence! - Jang Gi?

136
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:30,450
- This is uncanny. - I am curious about him.

137
00:05:30,453 --> 00:05:32,320
- You should remember this. - What?

138
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:34,050
You will die if you see your doppelganger.

139
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,990
I doubt we look the same.

140
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:39,360
- You will die. - I mean...

141
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:41,360
You shouldn't look at his picture if it comes up in this episode.

142
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:43,130
- Why not? - He already saw his doppelganger.

143
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:46,300
- He saw Han Gi Beom. - He already saw his doppelganger.

144
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,155
He will die soon.

145
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:51,995
Park Se Ri says it's really hard to avoid running into you.

146
00:05:52,675 --> 00:05:54,070
(That must be the reason why she won't visit Running Man.)

147
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,225
I am sure I will see her someday.

148
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:57,795
They resemble each other.

149
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:00,680
The last guest is Ju Yeon. Like I said before,

150
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:04,050
Ju Yeon is So Min's best friend and a former member of After School.

151
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,320
After School had...

152
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:08,250
a lot of hit songs.

153
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:12,115
Why don't you show us After School's performance?

154
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,115
We need to see "Diva".

155
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:16,360
We have to see this.

156
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,285
We have to see that.

157
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:21,370
When she goes to a karaoke, she plays her song and dances.

158
00:06:21,371 --> 00:06:23,070
- Really? - Yes.

159
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,800
(She has an abundant love for herself.)

160
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,500
You danced in front of a convenience store.

161
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,370
- What? - She was drinking beer...

162
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:32,235
in front of a convenience store when she turned on the music.

163
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:33,950
She really did that.

164
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,365
(A drunk performance of "Diva")

165
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,950
- She did that at dawn. - There was a garbage truck.

166
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:42,475
- She really did that. - Really?

167
00:06:42,492 --> 00:06:45,260
- The sun was rising. - She is incredible.

168
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,490
Ju Yeon, give us a performance of "Diva".

169
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:50,285
- Show us your charisma. - Show us.

170
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:54,300
(Here it comes.)

171
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:55,655
That's it.

172
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,440
(Everyone in this country knows.)

173
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,570
This is great.

174
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:01,370
(I am your)

175
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:05,235
(Diva, diva, di, di, di, diva)

176
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:09,235
(Practicing in front of the convenience store was effective.)

177
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,105
(Ji Hyo is turning into a diva too.)

178
00:07:15,191 --> 00:07:18,760
(Ju Yeon is being normal for the first time on this show.)

179
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,330
(She was my idol when I was in the military.)

180
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,630
(The song brings back memories.)

181
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:23,760
That was amazing.

182
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:26,000
We haven't heard this song in a while.

183
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:27,200
- It's very fun, right? - I love it.

184
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:29,000
I like it. It brings back memories.

185
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,855
Anyone could follow the dance moves.

186
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,740
It'd be so fun to dance with the audience.

187
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:35,010
- Should we all try? - What?

188
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,110
Let's try dancing all together.

189
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,680
(Suddenly?)

190
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,180
I'm sorry. She's like this.

191
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,950
She's like this.

192
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,610
- All together? - Yes.

193
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:44,880
Sure.

194
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:46,475
Ju Yeon, stand in the center.

195
00:07:46,622 --> 00:07:47,950
You should all do it.

196
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,050
We don't know when we'll get to see...

197
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:51,820
After School again.

198
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:52,820
You won't.

199
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:54,415
(Determined)

200
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:55,930
You don't have to...

201
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:57,345
You'll have to see them on "Saturday, Saturday Is a Singer".

202
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,300
Will we...

203
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:01,630
- But that show... - Oh, it's over too.

204
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:03,425
We don't know what will happen.

205
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,140
Jae Seok.

206
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:08,795
(Will "Saturday, Saturday Is a Singer" be able to air?)

207
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,795
Jae Seok.

208
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:14,365
It's complicated.

209
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:15,850
We need "Saturday, Saturday Is a Singer" to see After School.

210
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:16,880
Haha!

211
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:19,305
- Haha! - Get up.

212
00:08:19,756 --> 00:08:20,820
Haha.

213
00:08:20,823 --> 00:08:21,920
(How are you doing, Myung Soo and Jun Ha?)

214
00:08:21,924 --> 00:08:23,690
- He's crying. - Stop it.

215
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:24,860
Change the subject.

216
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,820
- Yes. - Change the subject.

217
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,285
Okay!

218
00:08:28,865 --> 00:08:30,630
I can hold it back. I'm not going to cry.

219
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:32,785
(I'm okay.)

220
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,770
Shall we start?

221
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:36,425
Okay. Should we dance together?

222
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,300
Since it's been so long,

223
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,710
all the staff members...

224
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,795
should shout it together.

225
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:46,535
Give energy to Ju Yeon.

226
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,850
Dear citizens, I beg you.

227
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,180
Please shout the chorus!

228
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:53,450
Let's start from the cameramen.

229
00:08:53,456 --> 00:08:55,045
Start.

230
00:08:55,057 --> 00:08:56,820
(Why are we doing this?)

231
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:59,545
Camera directors, start.

232
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:01,460
Chan Hee, come on!

233
00:09:01,464 --> 00:09:03,530
- Lighting director, start. - Start.

234
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:06,060
(He must have been waiting.)

235
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:07,170
Good.

236
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,300
We're one.

237
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:09,770
- We're one. - Pronounce it correctly.

238
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:11,340
(The whole staff miraculously comes together.)

239
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,440
Let's go!

240
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:14,070
5, 6...

241
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:17,680
(Tonight, tomorrow night, I can't stop thinking of you)

242
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,640
(I'm your)

243
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,435
(Diva, diva, di, di, diva!)

244
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:27,805
(Try it at home and at work.)

245
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:33,275
(Diva, diva, di, di, diva)

246
00:09:35,431 --> 00:09:37,045
It's been so long.

247
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,815
I love it.

248
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:40,885
Sexy.

249
00:09:41,103 --> 00:09:43,070
- Sexy. - Sexy.

250
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,300
- It brings back memories. - It's amazing.

251
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,570
(Satisfied)

252
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,070
Before we start the race,

253
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,980
please change into your team uniforms...

254
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,810
and fill in the couple registration from.

255
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:54,450
"Before we start the race"?

256
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,080
We've already been shooting for four hours.

257
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,180
I thought we were doing a talking race today.

258
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:00,450
We're just done introducing ourselves.

259
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:03,020
Seung Ri isn't saying anything.

260
00:10:03,025 --> 00:10:04,320
- He was overzealous... - He's exhausted.

261
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,160
in the beginning.

262
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:09,585
(It's finally time to show off your charms. The real race starts now.)

263
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,330
- Come here. - Hi.

264
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,300
- Have a seat. - There are some refreshments.

265
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:15,055
There's so much.

266
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:17,625
"Couple registration form".

267
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:19,640
We have to fill it in?

268
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:20,970
(Every couple has to fill in a registration form.)

269
00:10:20,977 --> 00:10:22,625
Specialty?

270
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,935
I've never lost in 3, 6, 9 my entire life.

271
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,680
- He's good at it. - I've never lost.

272
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:29,680
I'm really good at multiplication tables.

273
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:31,680
That's why I could start school early.

274
00:10:31,687 --> 00:10:32,950
Gosh, really?

275
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:35,190
- Because you were good? - Yes.

276
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:36,420
Is that possible?

277
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,690
That's strange.

278
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:40,045
You can start school early if you're good at multiplication tables?

279
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:42,930
I didn't start school early because of my birthday.

280
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,730
- It was multiplication tables. - Seriously?

281
00:10:44,734 --> 00:10:46,285
- Yes. - Is that possible?

282
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:48,555
Do you have mythomania?

283
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:51,200
- It's true. - No matter how good you are...

284
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:53,940
She just wants to say that she was very good even as a kid.

285
00:10:53,943 --> 00:10:55,510
Are you still good though?

286
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:56,940
I don't know because I haven't tried.

287
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,140
Then it doesn't count.

288
00:10:58,147 --> 00:10:59,980
It doesn't matter if you were good as a kid.

289
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:01,080
Should I give it a try?

290
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,810
(Se Chan and B.I are the only male couple.)

291
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:03,950
First of all,

292
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,780
why don't we write that our specialty is dance?

293
00:11:05,788 --> 00:11:07,450
- That sounds great. - Is there any song...

294
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:08,690
you want?

295
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:10,220
Well...

296
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:11,660
- Let's take a look first. - I...

297
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:12,790
personally...

298
00:11:12,795 --> 00:11:15,390
think we should play your song.

299
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,430
Then we'll get a chance.

300
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:18,730
Let's see.

301
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,155
Let's start from here.

302
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,700
What do you think?

303
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:22,800
Do you know this song?

304
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,040
I do.

305
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,440
If we play this, Haha will go like this.

306
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,140
But Haha might...

307
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:29,640
steal attention from us.

308
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,795
- You think so? Okay. - Pass.

309
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,050
(The next song is...)

310
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,950
("Untitled" by G-Dragon.)

311
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,850
I can do an impression of him.

312
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:39,920
Try it.

313
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:42,690
Even just once

314
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:43,790
Isn't that just B.I?

315
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,590
- If I could see you - If I could see you

316
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:50,190
(All guests today are very self-confident.)

317
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,585
Let's try another song.

318
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,060
- Do you know what this is? - What is it?

319
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:54,455
(Haha and Sun Mi take pictures for the registration form.)

320
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:57,700
(Haha does his best to look cute.)

321
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,125
(Pressing)

322
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:00,440
Is it a selfie stick?

323
00:12:00,443 --> 00:12:02,070
(They look surprisingly cute together.)

324
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:03,525
Let's do a sexy version.

325
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,335
(We're sexy.)

326
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,710
I'm going to copy you.

327
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,205
(Narcissistic)

328
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:14,420
(What are you guys doing?)

329
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:16,405
The pictures look amazing.

330
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,915
(They're done filling in the registration forms.)

331
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:23,030
(But these registration forms have a secret.)

332
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,700
(The eight couples are gathered for the mission.)

333
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,160
You guys look so awkward together.

334
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:28,070
He is tying a shoelace around me, saying it's in fashion.

335
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:30,200
Is that from your underwear?

336
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:32,170
It's a shoelace. It's apparently in fashion.

337
00:12:32,174 --> 00:12:34,210
(Se Chan is wearing a trendy item.)

338
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,110
- Are you judges? - No.

339
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,840
(I don't care about the fashion.)

340
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:40,980
I thought they were judges too.

341
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,280
No.

342
00:12:42,284 --> 00:12:44,035
They look the same.

343
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:45,780
Do you have your couple registration forms with you?

344
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:46,920
- Yes. - Yes.

345
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:48,545
(All the couples filled in the couple registration forms.)

346
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,020
There's a secret...

347
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,745
behind today's race.

348
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:54,090
What is it? Are there spies again?

349
00:12:54,096 --> 00:12:56,815
I knew it.

350
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,000
I knew there would be spies.

351
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:00,555
Some people must have come earlier.

352
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:04,285
Will you take the stickers off your registration forms?

353
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:08,310
(They didn't even know there was a sticker.)

354
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,910
"Couple IOU"?

355
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:11,410
What is this?

356
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,480
(Couple IOU)

357
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:13,810
Couple IOU?

358
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,210
(It's a couple IOU.)

359
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:16,905
What is this?

360
00:13:16,952 --> 00:13:18,220
"We will..."

361
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,420
What is this?

362
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,820
You deceived us.

363
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,690
I hate to owe someone.

364
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,245
Are you in debt?

365
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,075
- Why did you do that? - I didn't do anything.

366
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,660
(When did we get into debt?)

367
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:32,300
(What are these signed couple IOUs?)

368
00:13:32,301 --> 00:13:35,570
All of you are...

369
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,670
in debt right now.

370
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:37,970
- Why? - Why?

371
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:41,810
All the couple items,

372
00:13:41,811 --> 00:13:43,570
couple bags,

373
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,040
and refreshments you took...

374
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:48,980
have been taken into calculation.

375
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,820
Even the macarons and jellies?

376
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,550
- What? - That's ridiculous.

377
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:53,680
(Even the jellies?)

378
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:54,690
- Gosh. - You...

379
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,050
That's just ridiculous.

380
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,460
The debt is per individual, right?

381
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:00,960
You share your debt with your partner.

382
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,630
(The debt is shared between partners.)

383
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:06,030
Elijah even packed some food.

384
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:07,800
- I was hungry. - She did?

385
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:09,100
- She packed some food. - She did?

386
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:11,825
(Her greed left her in debt.)

387
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:14,440
You have to work together with your partner...

388
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,170
to pay off your debts.

389
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,040
The race is called Eternal Love.

390
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,710
(Eternal Love)

391
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,680
- Eternal Love. - Eternal Love.

392
00:14:21,684 --> 00:14:25,650
After every mission, the winners will win prize money.

393
00:14:25,654 --> 00:14:28,320
And that amount will be written off from their debts.

394
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:31,420
If you fail to pay off your debts,

395
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:32,960
you'll be penalized...

396
00:14:32,962 --> 00:14:35,430
according to the amount left.

397
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:38,700
Let me tell you how much each of you owe right now.

398
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,060
Our debt might not be that big.

399
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:43,155
First, Seok Jin and Ji Min.

400
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:45,840
- I don't think we owe a lot. - Couple bracelets, 50 dollars.

401
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,940
- These? - These?

402
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:48,310
(Couple bracelets, 50 dollars)

403
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,440
- These? - These?

404
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:50,795
Nice.

405
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:51,980
What?

406
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:53,440
They're worth 50 dollars?

407
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,310
- These are worth 50 dollars? - These?

408
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,350
No way.

409
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:57,550
My skin is reacting.

410
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:59,050
- Where did you get these? - These are worth 50 dollars?

411
00:14:59,054 --> 00:15:00,320
Couple bracelets, 50 dollars.

412
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,050
- It makes my skin itch. - They're ripping us off.

413
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:05,820
A bottle of water, four cookies and candies,

414
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,830
and five macarons.

415
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,530
Why did you eat so much?

416
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:11,730
(5 macarons?)

417
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,785
Why is he so obsessed with macarons?

418
00:15:14,203 --> 00:15:15,600
I'm the only one who ate them.

419
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:18,200
- You didn't eat any. - He ate so much.

420
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:20,170
And a pen.

421
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:22,065
It's 73 dollars in total.

422
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:23,570
That's a lot.

423
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:24,810
We're doomed.

424
00:15:24,813 --> 00:15:26,440
(Seok Jin has never earned that much from his stock investments.)

425
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:27,810
Kwang Soo and Elijah.

426
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:29,150
You'll be surprised.

427
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:30,980
Couple headphones, 50 dollars.

428
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:32,180
Oh, my.

429
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,450
(Couple headphones, 50 dollars)

430
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:34,520
(Shocked)

431
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:35,590
I...

432
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:37,820
didn't even want the headphones. I just liked the note.

433
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:40,690
1 fruit, 3 macarons,

434
00:15:40,696 --> 00:15:42,690
a cup of coffee, a bottle of water,

435
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:44,230
- and four cookies and candies. - They ate so much.

436
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,030
I didn't eat any. It's what Elijah packed.

437
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,885
(I didn't get to have any.)

438
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:52,070
Two pens and a box of wet wipes.

439
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,425
(How much do they owe?)

440
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,710
It's 81 dollars in total.

441
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,180
(It's a new record.)

442
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,580
Okay. It's over 80 dollars!

443
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,050
- We owe just 70 dollars. - We can do this.

444
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:04,550
I mean...

445
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:07,790
Se Chan and B.I. Couple socks,

446
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,790
- 20 dollars. They're the cheapest. - Okay.

447
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:13,890
1 pudding, 2 cookies and candies, and 2 pens.

448
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,430
It's 30 dollars in total. It's the lowest amount.

449
00:16:15,431 --> 00:16:16,560
Gosh.

450
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,455
We can do this.

451
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:25,625
(Debt Amounts)

452
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,710
The first mission to pay off your debts is...

453
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:31,940
Specialty Pawnshop.

454
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,540
(Specialty Pawnshop)

455
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,580
Oh, that.

456
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:36,780
(Running Man Pawnshop is here to buy specialties.)

457
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:38,950
- We have to buy something? - Specialties.

458
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:42,320
All the couples wrote down their specialties in the forms,

459
00:16:42,324 --> 00:16:44,090
and we're going to verify them.

460
00:16:44,093 --> 00:16:46,720
If you succeed, the pawnshop will determine the price...

461
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:47,930
and buy your specialty.

462
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,790
(The pawnshop will determine the price of the specialty.)

463
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:51,060
The first specialty is...

464
00:16:51,066 --> 00:16:53,430
- impressions. - Who wrote it?

465
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:54,830
- Me. - Me.

466
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:56,725
- Ji Min... - Did you write it too?

467
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,570
(Ji Min and Sun Mi's specialties are impressions.)

468
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:01,070
Sun Mi wrote it too.

469
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,310
Ji Min, what are you going to do?

470
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:04,310
To warm up,

471
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:06,410
- I'll mimic Dooly's mom. - Dooly's mom.

472
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,210
You know who she is, right?

473
00:17:08,217 --> 00:17:09,450
You have to know Dooly to understand this.

474
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,950
You know Dooly, right?

475
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,435
Look carefully. It's Dooly's mom.

476
00:17:13,722 --> 00:17:16,145
Dooly.

477
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:19,160
(Dooly)

478
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:21,130
(It's Dooly's mom.)

479
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,160
That's how she sounds.

480
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:24,190
Dooly.

481
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,430
That's exactly how she sounds.

482
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:28,555
Where is he?

483
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,970
Right. That's how she sounds.

484
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:32,940
I had completely forgotten, but I remember it now.

485
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,840
It's from my memory.

486
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:37,170
- "Where is he?" - It's from the cartoon.

487
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:39,080
So Min wants to mix things up.

488
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,150
She wants to mimic Dooly's mom...

489
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,410
in Joo Hyun's voice.

490
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:44,520
Okay.

491
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,950
In Joo Hyun's voice.

492
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:46,980
Dooly's mom?

493
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,575
(So Min wants to try it in the only voice she can mimic.)

494
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:52,760
Gosh, Dooly.

495
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,190
(Gosh, Dooly.)

496
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:58,430
(Isn't that just Joo Hyun?)

497
00:17:58,434 --> 00:17:59,500
(The reaction is lukewarm.)

498
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,870
Gosh, Dooly, that punk. Where is he?

499
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,370
(So Min becomes desperate.)

500
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:06,855
(She ruins the childhood memories.)

501
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:09,140
(She becomes desperate and makes Dooly's mom swear.)

502
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:13,210
Since you just mimicked an animal...

503
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:16,480
Xi A is going to surprise you.

504
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:18,180
- Can she do it? - She can...

505
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,180
mimic dogs perfectly.

506
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,045
When she barks, all the dogs in her neighborhood bark back.

507
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:24,960
(Shouldn't she go on "How is that Possible?")

508
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,420
- That's how good she is? - Yes.

509
00:18:26,428 --> 00:18:27,690
She's a native speaker.

510
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,315
What kind of dog?

511
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:31,430
- I'll do both big and small. - Both big and small.

512
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:33,155
Let's start with a big dog.

513
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:35,470
(A big dog)

514
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:36,870
(A small dog)

515
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,225
See?

516
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,270
(It's nothing special.)

517
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,140
- She's good. - B.I can do it too.

518
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:45,180
(Barking)

519
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,510
It's a seal.

520
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:49,305
- Is that a seal or a dog? - It's a countryside dog.

521
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,220
(That's not how you do it.)

522
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:53,580
(What?)

523
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:56,775
(It suddenly turns into a dog fight.)

524
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,920
(A Maltese puppy jumps in.)

525
00:18:59,928 --> 00:19:01,430
(Xi A did say she could make all dogs bark.)

526
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,430
(She is making all the dogs here bark.)

527
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:03,760
It's turned into a dog fight.

528
00:19:03,766 --> 00:19:05,000
It's a dog fight.

529
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,730
Stop barking!

530
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:08,030
(A neighbor gets angry.)

531
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,200
We'll have to do...

532
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,240
a barking competition. You just saw it, right?

533
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,940
Xi A can both bark normally...

534
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,510
and fight. She can fight too.

535
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:17,880
We can do a countryside dog.

536
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,410
Xi A can fight with a countryside dog too.

537
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:22,835
Bring it on. Go on. If you laugh, you lose.

538
00:19:23,352 --> 00:19:25,820
(B.I is warming up.)

539
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:29,145
(Suddenly, she changes.)

540
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:32,775
- He lost. - You lost.

541
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,660
- B.I lost. - They were fighting.

542
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:37,730
What kind of game is this? What is this?

543
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,700
How do you know who wins?

544
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,430
B.I did lower his tail.

545
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:43,400
- Right? - I did expose my belly.

546
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:44,795
Good.

547
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:45,900
You win.

548
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,470
- Bring it on. - I win.

549
00:19:47,476 --> 00:19:49,840
If you're a dog, we'll try a cat.

550
00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:51,710
- Okay. - A cat and a dog can fight too.

551
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:54,565
Come on in. Come here.

552
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:56,305
Good.

553
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,520
(Calm)

554
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,680
(Despite Xi A's attack,)

555
00:20:00,689 --> 00:20:03,290
(Sun Mi remains calm.)

556
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,490
(She might soon bite Sun Mi.)

557
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:05,760
(Sun Mi explodes.)

558
00:20:05,761 --> 00:20:07,545
Hold on.

559
00:20:08,297 --> 00:20:09,930
Good.

560
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:12,660
She did well, right? It gave me goosebumps.

561
00:20:12,668 --> 00:20:15,470
How do you know who wins?

562
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,200
- What is this? - What...

563
00:20:17,206 --> 00:20:18,900
What is this?

564
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,870
- What kind of game is this? - Who just won?

565
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:21,870
Who won?

566
00:20:21,877 --> 00:20:24,140
- I want to try a cat. - Ju Yeon wants to try a cat.

567
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:26,210
- Ju Yeon will try a cat. - Ju Yeon and...

568
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:28,350
- Sun Mi should compete. - Try.

569
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,680
- A cat? - Yes.

570
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,680
Sun Mi, you're doing great.

571
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,680
Are you ready?

572
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:33,680
(Cute)

573
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,690
(They start cute.)

574
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,890
(But soon they reveal their true colors.)

575
00:20:36,892 --> 00:20:39,615
(Be quiet!)

576
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:45,385
What is this? If you do this, do you win?

577
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,430
(No one knows the criteria,)

578
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:50,130
(but somehow you can determine who wins.)

579
00:20:50,138 --> 00:20:52,600
What is this? Why did she do that?

580
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,940
Is the cat's fur standing on end?

581
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,910
- Yes, exactly. - It's the cat's fur standing up.

582
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:57,670
(There are mean cats in this world.)

583
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,380
Good job.

584
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:02,680
- Good job. - I won.

585
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:04,580
- We can do a chimpanzee. - Okay.

586
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,420
- A chimpanzee. - A chimpanzee.

587
00:21:06,421 --> 00:21:09,075
(A chimpanzee escapes.)

588
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:12,245
(Here comes a chimpanzee.)

589
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:13,790
Make some sounds.

590
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,945
(So Min always looks clumsy, but she is actually pretty good.)

591
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:19,700
You're supposed to mimic the sounds.

592
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:21,000
Make some sounds!

593
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,870
So Min, make some sounds!

594
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,895
(It's a competition where you have to mimic sounds.)

595
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:29,010
If I make a sound, I can't look like a chimpanzee.

596
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,040
(Dilemma)

597
00:21:30,045 --> 00:21:31,895
(She forces herself to make sounds.)

598
00:21:31,947 --> 00:21:34,710
(So Min fails because she doesn't sound very much like a chimpanzee.)

599
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,135
Good.

600
00:21:36,184 --> 00:21:37,510
Very good.

601
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:39,620
She just looks like one.

602
00:21:39,621 --> 00:21:41,150
If no one... You want to try?

603
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:43,090
- Sun Mi can mimic Kim Hye Soo. - Kim Hye Soo.

604
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,190
- Kim Hye Soo? - Listen carefully.

605
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:48,690
- It's from "Tazza". - Kim Hye Soo.

606
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:50,685
- Seriously? - Listen carefully.

607
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,955
Stop right there!

608
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:56,930
I can shoot you!

609
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,000
She sounds exactly like her.

610
00:21:58,006 --> 00:22:01,825
I can shoot you!

611
00:22:02,144 --> 00:22:03,940
I can shoot you!

612
00:22:03,946 --> 00:22:06,280
(This is the original version.)

613
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:08,610
(I can shoot you!)

614
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:11,180
Leave the money right there. I'll shoot you.

615
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:12,850
No!

616
00:22:12,854 --> 00:22:14,220
Stop!

617
00:22:14,222 --> 00:22:17,850
- I can shoot you, Sun Mi! - I can shoot you!

618
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:20,720
(Your specialty can get stolen.)

619
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,130
Why did you have to do that?

620
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,230
Fail.

621
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,430
(Se Chan steals Sun Mi's specialty.)

622
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,700
Ju Yeon, can you do something?

623
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:29,200
It's okay to do something very small too.

624
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,600
- Really? - You don't have to be good.

625
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:33,500
- Don't worry. - Gosh. Don't skip meals.

626
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:34,970
- Who is that? - Explain first.

627
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:36,010
(No one has heard it before.)

628
00:22:36,011 --> 00:22:37,325
- Who is that? - Who is that?

629
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,180
Your dad?

630
00:22:39,181 --> 00:22:40,680
Yes, it's my dad.

631
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:41,850
(How did you know?)

632
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,265
Your dad?

633
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:46,220
How can you mimic your own dad?

634
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:47,950
Please do it again.

635
00:22:47,956 --> 00:22:50,390
Gosh. Don't skip meals.

636
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:52,615
- Is that what he always tells you? - Yes.

637
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:53,790
Let me try.

638
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,230
Get out, you punk!

639
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,515
(Get out, you punk!)

640
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,530
It's my dad. My dad.

641
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,270
Let me mimic my mom.

642
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:04,940
This disgusting Ha family.

643
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,740
(This disgusting Ha family.)

644
00:23:08,744 --> 00:23:12,865
(What happened to Haha's mom?)

645
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:16,680
I win, right? It happened just yesterday.

646
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:18,220
- It happened yesterday. - Let us win!

647
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,720
(They even mimic their own families.)

648
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,790
(The pawnshop is judging their specialties carefully.)

649
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,860
The next specialty is "body".

650
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,390
- Okay! Bring it on. - Okay!

651
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,230
- Okay! - Sun Mi.

652
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,830
We're confident.

653
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:30,990
You have to twist your body parts, right?

654
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:33,630
Let's start from the person who wrote it...

655
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:35,170
and move onto others.

656
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,200
Xi A will start.

657
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:38,555
Okay.

658
00:23:38,774 --> 00:23:40,740
My tongue can reach my elbow.

659
00:23:40,742 --> 00:23:41,910
Look.

660
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,010
It's not supposed to?

661
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,365
(It's very difficult.)

662
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:48,865
(Her tongue reaches her elbow easily.)

663
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:51,005
See?

664
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:56,720
- How do you do it? - Her tongue touches her elbow.

665
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:57,790
Here?

666
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:59,615
(I think I can do it too.)

667
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:02,015
Where exactly?

668
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,030
(They all try,)

669
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,330
(but it doesn't work.)

670
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,755
Elijah.

671
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,170
She can't.

672
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,770
(Forcing)

673
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,670
(Kwang Soo forcefully brings her elbow to her tongue.)

674
00:24:12,674 --> 00:24:14,270
- Gosh. - It worked.

675
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:15,940
- Seriously. - You're lying.

676
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:17,010
You can't, right?

677
00:24:17,012 --> 00:24:18,835
(No one apart from Xi A can do it.)

678
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:21,410
- Ji Min should win. - That's right.

679
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,450
(Everyone, Ji Min should win.)

680
00:24:22,451 --> 00:24:24,180
(Ji Min should win?)

681
00:24:24,186 --> 00:24:26,575
- Look at her. - Ji Min...

682
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:30,345
(Her tongue reaches her elbow so easily.)

683
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:31,815
There you go.

684
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,290
(She is even faster...)

685
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:35,130
(than Xi A.)

686
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,315
- Her tongue is so long. - Her tongue is so long.

687
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,330
- Look at Ji Min. - Ji Min...

688
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:40,900
She can lick all over her arm.

689
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:42,455
(She can lick all over her arm.)

690
00:24:42,671 --> 00:24:44,285
She can lick all over her arm.

691
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:46,440
She really can.

692
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,540
(Ji Min steals Xi A's specialty.)

693
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,640
No one can beat Ji Min.

694
00:24:49,644 --> 00:24:51,340
She can lick all over her arm.

695
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,740
I won't be able to get married because of Running Man.

696
00:24:53,749 --> 00:24:55,535
Can anyone do something else?

697
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:57,510
Can I try walking on my hands?

698
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,920
She can walk on her hands.

699
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,505
What's that?

700
00:25:00,956 --> 00:25:02,350
(She is flexible from yoga training.)

701
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:05,560
(Ju Yeon is going to walk on her hands.)

702
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,090
Hold on. It seems like I can only swing.

703
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,715
(It seems like I can only swing.)

704
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,430
Ju Yeon.

705
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:13,960
Who can't do that?

706
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:15,985
Who can't swing like that?

707
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:17,900
I can swing.

708
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,040
I can swing on my hands.

709
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,125
Ju Yeon, please stop.

710
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:24,565
You keep disappointing me with small things.

711
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:26,140
(It's not a big disappointment.)

712
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:27,910
It's nothing big, but...

713
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,110
Ju Yeon.

714
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:30,180
(Ju Yeon keeps disappointing us.)

715
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:32,120
It's fine, but...

716
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,150
So Min, what are you doing?

717
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:36,220
It's a cobra.

718
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,815
(Isn't it incredible?)

719
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:40,920
Do it at home instead.

720
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:42,860
(He cuts her off.)

721
00:25:42,864 --> 00:25:44,585
It's not appropriate for the show.

722
00:25:44,933 --> 00:25:46,330
It's not good enough.

723
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:47,400
Go back.

724
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:49,400
So Min showed the cobra to Seok Jin.

725
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:50,700
"Oh, it's a cobra."

726
00:25:50,705 --> 00:25:53,100
(What do you think?)

727
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:55,440
(A moment ago)

728
00:25:55,443 --> 00:25:57,040
(It's a cobra. You don't know?)

729
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:59,910
(Oh, it's a cobra.)

730
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,250
(He's not interested.)

731
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,280
I just wanted her to stop.

732
00:26:04,286 --> 00:26:05,750
(I'm sorry, So Min.)

733
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:07,620
(The body specialty competition is over.)

734
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:11,220
Let me go over the things you wrote.

735
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:12,590
(So Min and Seung Ri wrote the next one.)

736
00:26:12,594 --> 00:26:15,360
So Min and Seung Ri wrote, "dance".

737
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:18,430
We can dance to any kind of music.

738
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:19,530
- That sounds fun. - That's right.

739
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,330
- To any kind of music. - Any kind?

740
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,700
Any kind.

741
00:26:22,704 --> 00:26:24,630
- We can dance to anything. - That's impossible.

742
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:26,900
If it's true, it really is a specialty.

743
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:29,140
- I can dance to anything. - Really?

744
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:30,940
- Even to the nature sounds? - Yes.

745
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:32,210
Okay. Give us some music.

746
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:34,710
(His specialty will be verified. What's the first music?)

747
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:37,750
(Shark family)

748
00:26:37,752 --> 00:26:40,075
(Seung Ri is ready.)

749
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:43,390
(He starts to dance right away.)

750
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,450
There you go.

751
00:26:44,459 --> 00:26:46,460
(It's a grown-up shark.)

752
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:47,960
- He's mimicking a shark. - It's a shark.

753
00:26:47,963 --> 00:26:50,185
He's very creative.

754
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:52,000
(The grown-up shark is getting ready to swim.)

755
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,030
He's good.

756
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:55,455
(He suddenly lowers his fins.)

757
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,130
He's good.

758
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,670
- He's good. - He's good.

759
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:02,225
(How can he dance like this to this song?)

760
00:27:02,711 --> 00:27:04,140
It's getting fun.

761
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:06,380
(Are you ready to jump with the grown-up shark?)

762
00:27:06,381 --> 00:27:08,335
(Excited)

763
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:12,535
(Cute)

764
00:27:12,687 --> 00:27:15,945
(This grown-up shark seems old. He's definitely not a baby shark.)

765
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:18,375
He's cute.

766
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:20,315
How cute.

767
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:22,230
- The song changed. - Hey.

768
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,030
- That has a nice vibe. - That's the sound of a valley.

769
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,100
(Can he dance to the sound of water?)

770
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,685
Can he dance to this?

771
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:28,200
He's pondering.

772
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:30,125
(He's dancing!)

773
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:35,010
(His wavy dance move conveys the sound of the water as it is.)

774
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,440
- That looks like water. - He's expressing the valley.

775
00:27:37,445 --> 00:27:38,540
(She acknowledges his expression.)

776
00:27:38,546 --> 00:27:40,065
- He's very expressive. - It really resembles water.

777
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:43,750
(All of a sudden, the scene turns into a valley.)

778
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:46,075
He did definitely earn his spot with his dancing.

779
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:48,250
- He's pretty good. - He gained a lot of weight.

780
00:27:48,256 --> 00:27:51,520
(He's dancing pretty well, but he gained a lot of weight.)

781
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:52,760
It looks just like the flow of the water.

782
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:54,190
(His movement is light, albeit his weight gain.)

783
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:55,760
- He can make this work. - I mean...

784
00:27:55,764 --> 00:27:57,690
He really did. Look at his bottom.

785
00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:01,115
(The song changes once again. What is this familiar song?)

786
00:28:01,202 --> 00:28:04,400
(It's the news theme song that notifies the 8pm news.)

787
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:05,440
He's flustered a bit.

788
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,065
(News? All of a sudden?)

789
00:28:09,744 --> 00:28:14,535
(I danced to the sound of water. This is a piece of cake.)

790
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:19,235
(She's amazed. He can dance to this song well too.)

791
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,520
(He's expressing that the news is on.)

792
00:28:21,523 --> 00:28:22,690
That's the TV.

793
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:24,750
(He's expressing that the news is on.)

794
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:27,460
- That's the TV. - That's the screen.

795
00:28:27,462 --> 00:28:29,885
Something is airing. Something is airing.

796
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,590
- The news is airing. - He's pretty good.

797
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,700
- He's expressing the TV. - It's airing.

798
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:36,270
- That's the TV. - It's the 8pm news.

799
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,840
- He's expressing the TV. - The 8pm news.

800
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,170
- That's the TV. - He's expressing the 8pm news.

801
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:43,970
- It's 8pm. 8pm. - 8pm.

802
00:28:43,979 --> 00:28:46,710
- Let's give it up for him. - He's so good.

803
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:50,510
Who wants to try dancing to the water sound and the 8pm news?

804
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,380
I'll accept challengers for these two songs.

805
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:53,520
(Anyone can challenge him.)

806
00:28:53,521 --> 00:28:54,950
Okay. Should I try it?

807
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:56,850
- You should. - B.I.

808
00:28:56,858 --> 00:28:57,990
B.I!

809
00:28:57,993 --> 00:28:59,860
You'll dance to the water sound and the news theme song.

810
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:02,760
Do the trendy moves like this.

811
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:05,885
- B.I. - He might be good at this.

812
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,900
(The sound of water plays first.)

813
00:29:08,903 --> 00:29:10,270
- This isn't easy. - My gosh.

814
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:11,740
It's not easy to dance to this.

815
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,355
(He wriggles his body as soon as the song begins.)

816
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,365
(I can see the water.)

817
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:20,135
Keep going. Even your microphone is helping too.

818
00:29:20,982 --> 00:29:22,735
- That's right. - It looks like the flowing water.

819
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,180
He's pretty good.

820
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,535
(Sometimes, I dance to the water sound.)

821
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:27,020
It looks like the flowing water.

822
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:29,990
(He's flexible and expressive. B.I's water dance is a threat.)

823
00:29:29,991 --> 00:29:33,190
Express the water flowing down. Go for it, B.I. That's it.

824
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:35,045
That's it. The water is flowing down.

825
00:29:35,163 --> 00:29:37,660
His movement does look like water flowing down. Seriously.

826
00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,700
Dance to the 8pm news song.

827
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,315
- 8pm news? - That was great.

828
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:43,770
Get into the rhythm.

829
00:29:43,772 --> 00:29:45,540
You must look serious.

830
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,100
- This isn't easy to pull off. - His dance looks hopeful.

831
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:50,740
- His dance looks hopeful. - It's not easy.

832
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:54,535
(His gestures and footwork suddenly look drastically old.)

833
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:58,280
(Hold on. I'm not done yet.)

834
00:29:58,286 --> 00:30:00,250
(Something seems off.)

835
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,650
- It's getting hard. - It's hard.

836
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:04,950
I think his steps got all jumbled up.

837
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,745
He's doing the same dance moves.

838
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:10,260
He danced well to the water sound, but he messed up with the news song.

839
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:12,700
He used the same hand and foot at the same time like this.

840
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,470
Before he realized it, this was what happened to him.

841
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,200
- At this point... - Stop that.

842
00:30:17,205 --> 00:30:20,640
I'm sorry. He's the leader of iKON, but this is what he did.

843
00:30:20,642 --> 00:30:22,340
- B.I was good, - This must be hard.

844
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:24,010
but Seung Ri was better.

845
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:26,480
You must express that something was going to air.

846
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:28,750
It's because he didn't prepare the choreography in advance.

847
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,750
Elijah, do you want to try this?

848
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:34,305
- Go for it if you want to. Great. - My gosh.

849
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:37,120
Here's the thing. You never know what will happen.

850
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:38,460
- Exactly. - You really don't know.

851
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,415
She learned dancing for three years.

852
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:42,815
Here it is.

853
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:45,730
(She starts differently from the others by turning.)

854
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:48,085
(Exuding her sexiness)

855
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:50,930
(What? That doesn't look sexy.)

856
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,270
What is that?

857
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:53,940
- What a twist! - What is that?

858
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:56,040
(We thought the dance was going to look sexy,)

859
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:58,440
(but she awkwardly moves her body.)

860
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:01,440
(She unexpectedly moves her body as if it's getting dislocated.)

861
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:05,380
(Strangely, this awkward movement goes well with the theme song.)

862
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:08,250
- That's so fitting. It works. - Great. Great.

863
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,850
- What a twist. - She's doing well.

864
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,190
- My goodness. - Well done.

865
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:14,690
My goodness. That was great. The last one was great.

866
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,590
- The last one was great. - The song ended.

867
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:18,190
(She reinterpreted the theme song with her awkward movement.)

868
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:21,100
This one. The last one was great. It was awesome.

869
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:22,400
- Her dance had depth. - Right now...

870
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:23,770
- That was great. - Exactly.

871
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,270
- Right now... - Even Seung Ri recognized that.

872
00:31:25,273 --> 00:31:27,240
- That was great. - I never knew the song was upbeat.

873
00:31:27,242 --> 00:31:29,110
- Well done. - It was really good.

874
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,410
- You ought to try it too. - You must.

875
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:32,880
- You must dance. - Go for it.

876
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:34,740
- What am I going to do? - I think she's going to do well.

877
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,605
I'm not that good at dancing.

878
00:31:37,185 --> 00:31:39,320
- Xi A, take it easy. - Okay.

879
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,290
Xi A is up. She'll dance to the water sound first.

880
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,690
(What? She suddenly shakes off her body.)

881
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:48,960
Great, great. That was awesome, Xi A.

882
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:50,930
Xi A. You're doing well.

883
00:31:50,932 --> 00:31:53,860
- She looked uninterested at first. - She's so serious.

884
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:56,130
- She was uninterested at first. - That was great just now.

885
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:57,870
- She's good. - My gosh.

886
00:31:57,872 --> 00:32:01,100
Xi A, it's going to be the 8pm news. The 8pm news theme song.

887
00:32:01,109 --> 00:32:03,740
- The 8pm news song. She's good. - 8pm news.

888
00:32:03,745 --> 00:32:05,495
(Bouncing off)

889
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:09,605
(I'll start cheerfully. The 8pm news will begin!)

890
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:13,950
(She vigorously shakes her body.)

891
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,990
(Just like the breaking news, it's brief and simple.)

892
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,075
She dances like my mother.

893
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,945
She sort of dances like me.

894
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:25,085
- Here it comes. - She has to go for it now.

895
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:26,400
(For some reason...)

896
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:28,200
- Here it is. - That's the shuffle.

897
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:29,625
(Something looks off.)

898
00:32:29,938 --> 00:32:33,040
(She does the shuffle which is an old dance move.)

899
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:35,370
(And she dances the hammer dance which is trending now.)

900
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,910
- What is this? - Why did she mix those?

901
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,980
- No way. - She did this dance instead.

902
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,110
- Xi A, I liked everything. - She should've done this instead.

903
00:32:42,116 --> 00:32:43,910
What was this?

904
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,380
(She fails to overcome the theme song.)

905
00:32:45,386 --> 00:32:47,580
That was great. It was great.

906
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,790
Xi A's dance was good,

907
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,390
- but it's Elijah versus Seung Ri. - That's right. Yes.

908
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:54,890
The final match is between Elijah and Seung Ri.

909
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:58,460
The scores are being tallied up at the pawnshop.

910
00:32:58,466 --> 00:33:01,100
- They're doing that now. - The process is thorough.

911
00:33:01,102 --> 00:33:04,900
All right. We'll choose a different song for the last match.

912
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:06,970
- A new song? - Yes, we'll pick a different song.

913
00:33:06,975 --> 00:33:08,400
- We'll play the song now. - Okay.

914
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:10,095
(What is the last song that will decide the last match?)

915
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:12,110
(It's the theme song of a Saturday show, "Unanswered Questions".)

916
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:14,140
- It's for "Unanswered Questions". - This is a hard one.

917
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:16,805
- They must dance to this song. - They'll dance to this?

918
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,180
(To this song?)

919
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:20,950
- Seung Ri. He's Kim Sang Joong. - He's getting ready.

920
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:23,190
- It's his facial expression. - It looks like Kim Sang Joong's.

921
00:33:23,191 --> 00:33:28,815
(He resembles Kim Sang Joong, but what kind of dance will he show us?)

922
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,885
(Turning)

923
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,700
(He dominates the atmosphere with a serious turn.)

924
00:33:34,702 --> 00:33:36,625
(Dancing)

925
00:33:37,171 --> 00:33:40,440
(Everyone is laughing at his playful movements.)

926
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:43,525
(She's the only one who can't seem to laugh.)

927
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:47,065
(She's practicing in a serious manner.)

928
00:33:47,615 --> 00:33:49,880
- She's ready to do hers now. - She's getting into the rhythm.

929
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:52,935
- She wants to win. She's trying. - She's getting into the rhythm.

930
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:56,120
(Looking silly)

931
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:58,190
(But here's the thing.)

932
00:33:58,192 --> 00:34:01,215
- Great! - Elijah is joining him.

933
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:05,215
(Elijah, who finishes practicing, sets out.)

934
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:08,130
- Elijah. - They look good together.

935
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:11,670
(Thus began the unexpected pair dance of "Unanswered Questions".)

936
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:12,970
My goodness.

937
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:15,440
(For some reason, their dances seem similar.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

938
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:16,640
Their dances look similar.

939
00:34:16,644 --> 00:34:18,980
(These two master dancers' gestures and facial expressions are similar.)

940
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,280
Elijah is great.

941
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:22,980
We watched Seung Ri dance. I really liked this one.

942
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,480
- That was great. I liked it too. - It was.

943
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:27,105
- It was good, right? - It was connected.

944
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:28,620
But Elijah isn't an easy match.

945
00:34:28,623 --> 00:34:30,475
(Swinging)

946
00:34:30,692 --> 00:34:32,190
(It's my turn now.)

947
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,390
- She's "Tomb Raider". - It fits the music.

948
00:34:34,395 --> 00:34:36,160
- What about the highlight? - It's coming up.

949
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:38,945
- She looks really serious too. - Four,

950
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,055
3, 2, 1.

951
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,200
(Lightly shaking)

952
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:44,600
(She does her signature dance move again.)

953
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:46,040
Hey, her dance suits the song.

954
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,725
(She does her signature dance move again.)

955
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:52,395
(Her dance move reminds them of the dance from the 90s.)

956
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,140
(Her old dance suits the song again.)

957
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:56,980
- That's Fin.K.L's dance. - It's the same dance.

958
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:58,750
Hey, that looks like S.E.S' dance.

959
00:34:58,753 --> 00:35:01,350
- It's S.E.S' dance. - Wasn't that the dance move?

960
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,520
- She's using them well. - All of a sudden, it changed.

961
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:04,950
That was great.

962
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:07,120
(Elijah reinterpreted the theme song of "Unanswered Questions".)

963
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:08,290
I couldn't breathe.

964
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:09,830
- It was. - That was sudden.

965
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,660
(It was like Deux's "In Summer".)

966
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:15,000
I had no idea that she'd do this to the theme song of that show.

967
00:35:15,002 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm very curious how this challenge will affect these two.

968
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,310
- You should give her more points. - Please be generous.

969
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,940
- Next one is B.I. - B.I.

970
00:35:24,946 --> 00:35:27,040
- He wrote, "writing poems". - What?

971
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:28,480
- Poems? - Writing poems?

972
00:35:28,483 --> 00:35:31,335
Usually, I write lyrics a lot.

973
00:35:31,686 --> 00:35:35,535
I titled this to "Running Man".

974
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,520
- Let me recite a brief poem. - Great.

975
00:35:38,526 --> 00:35:41,645
- The title, "Running Man". - "Running Man".

976
00:35:41,896 --> 00:35:45,145
"A small version of our society, Running Man."

977
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,230
(I'm already getting into the poem.)

978
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,200
"My mom once told me..."

979
00:35:49,203 --> 00:35:53,095
"that airtime leads to my pay, and I must take care of my airtime."

980
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:57,395
"You must swim against the popular opinion to be on TV."

981
00:35:58,212 --> 00:36:02,480
(These personalities on variety shows totally agree.)

982
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:06,335
"When everyone says 1 word, say 10 to be on TV."

983
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:09,305
(That's why I talked so much.)

984
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:12,460
"Show your right cheek when they slap your left."

985
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,145
"That's how people will see that you even got slapped."

986
00:36:16,164 --> 00:36:17,160
(Only one clip aired.)

987
00:36:17,165 --> 00:36:21,930
(Running Man is the hub of personalities on variety shows.)

988
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:24,430
- That was great. It's amazing. - My goodness, that example.

989
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:28,270
(B.I's theory of "Two Slaps on Variety Shows" moves them.)

990
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:31,565
- That example. It touched my heart. - It's amazing.

991
00:36:31,779 --> 00:36:32,780
I can relate.

992
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,910
"I will try to become a fox to survive..."

993
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:40,605
"in this animal kingdom that's swarming with wild beasts."

994
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:43,520
"Lee Kwang Soo. I only have one target."

995
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,760
(Lee Kwang Soo. I only have one target.)

996
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,290
(Why me? All of a sudden? Why on earth would that be me?)

997
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:49,830
- Why... - Come on.

998
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,990
(Even the end of B.I's "Running Man" is neat.)

999
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:54,300
- His expressions were great. - I wrote this in a hurry yesterday.

1000
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:57,700
- In a way, you could say that... - He wore that famous song too.

1001
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:00,595
- it's the reality of variety shows. - That's right.

1002
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,210
"Show your right cheek..."

1003
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,540
- "when they slap your left." - "When they slap your left."

1004
00:37:03,544 --> 00:37:05,980
- "Only a slap will air on TV." - "Only a slap will air on TV."

1005
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,850
Gosh, your poem definitely struck a chord with us.

1006
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,835
Let's give him a big hand.

1007
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,850
It was amazing.

1008
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:15,020
It was so touching.

1009
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:17,620
This is why he writes so many good songs.

1010
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,960
Lastly, Elijah's specialty is...

1011
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:22,120
- her sense of balance. - I see.

1012
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:24,645
She learned ballet too.

1013
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:28,600
1 player will spin 10 times...

1014
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:31,500
and pour the water into the cup over their partner's head...

1015
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:33,500
within five seconds. Pour the most water into the cup to win.

1016
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,800
(Spin and pour the water into your partner's cup.)

1017
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:36,640
- Let us try first. - Okay.

1018
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:39,180
Bobby and Ji Hyo.

1019
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,180
- Ji Hyo. - Yes.

1020
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:43,950
It'd be fun to see Bobby get splashed with water.

1021
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,365
Ready.

1022
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:47,020
- Let's go. - Ready.

1023
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:49,290
(Ji Hyo has to spin 10 times and pour the water into Bobby's cup.)

1024
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,620
- Ready. - Hold on.

1025
00:37:50,625 --> 00:37:51,790
Go.

1026
00:37:51,792 --> 00:37:52,890
- 1... - 1...

1027
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:54,960
(She has to try to pour as much water as possible into the cup.)

1028
00:37:54,962 --> 00:37:56,160
- 4, - 4,

1029
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:58,085
- 5, 6... - 5, 6...

1030
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:00,915
(Ji Hyo is doing great.)

1031
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:04,125
(Ji Hyo has spun 7 times.)

1032
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:06,140
(She has to grab the basket.)

1033
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,600
Grab it.

1034
00:38:07,608 --> 00:38:09,210
(Unstable)

1035
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,270
Grab it.

1036
00:38:10,278 --> 00:38:11,410
(She grabs the basket.)

1037
00:38:11,412 --> 00:38:12,410
Go.

1038
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:18,105
(Now she has to pour the water into the cup.)

1039
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:21,875
(Running)

1040
00:38:23,691 --> 00:38:26,915
(She splashes the water over Bobby.)

1041
00:38:27,061 --> 00:38:30,685
(No water goes into the cup.)

1042
00:38:30,932 --> 00:38:32,230
(I feel dizzy. Let me lie down for a moment.)

1043
00:38:32,233 --> 00:38:34,230
She wasn't planning on pouring the water into the cup.

1044
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,100
My goodness.

1045
00:38:36,103 --> 00:38:37,830
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1046
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,540
- She's a spy. - Ji Hyo.

1047
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,270
- No one pays attention to Bobby. - Ji Hyo.

1048
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:43,540
Everyone is focused on Ji Hyo.

1049
00:38:43,544 --> 00:38:45,710
You should control your body well.

1050
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:48,140
You shouldn't just splash the water like Ji Hyo did.

1051
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,180
You can never get to your partner.

1052
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:52,480
As soon as you grab the basket...

1053
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:53,850
Sun Mi will try.

1054
00:38:53,854 --> 00:38:55,535
What should I do?

1055
00:38:55,957 --> 00:38:57,590
I can't see anything right now.

1056
00:38:57,592 --> 00:38:59,960
That's good. That might help.

1057
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:02,390
Dancers know how to spin without getting dizzy.

1058
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:03,890
That's right.

1059
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,390
- Let's start. - Okay.

1060
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,855
Ready.

1061
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,685
- Go. - You can do this.

1062
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:12,055
- 1, 2. - Good. She's fast.

1063
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:13,855
- What's with her? - Three.

1064
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:15,200
What is she doing?

1065
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,310
(Are you already feeling dizzy?)

1066
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,440
- Already? - You have to bend over.

1067
00:39:17,445 --> 00:39:19,210
- 5, 6. - 5, 6.

1068
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:22,950
(She screamed from the beginning. Will she be able to walk?)

1069
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,480
- Grab the basket! - Go!

1070
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:25,750
Gosh.

1071
00:39:25,753 --> 00:39:26,850
Hold on.

1072
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,350
(Will she show off a dance singer's sense of balance?)

1073
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:31,120
(Let me grab the bowl.)

1074
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,960
(She falls.)

1075
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,020
(Just like Ji Hyo,)

1076
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,430
(let me lie down for a moment.)

1077
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,460
- Are you okay? - Sun Mi!

1078
00:39:37,465 --> 00:39:38,560
Are you okay?

1079
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:39,900
- Is this real? - Is your head okay?

1080
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,160
- Sun Mi! - Are you okay?

1081
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:42,260
- Is your head okay? - Are you okay?

1082
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:43,600
Hey.

1083
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:45,430
(At a moment like this...)

1084
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,770
"Siren"!

1085
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:48,355
Call an ambulance!

1086
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:50,210
"Siren"!

1087
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,270
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1088
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:54,280
- She couldn't even grab the bowl. - Are you okay?

1089
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:56,435
This is the funniest thing you've ever done on variety shows.

1090
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:59,520
Ever since her debut,

1091
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,750
how could she fall so naturally?

1092
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:04,290
- Now Se Chan and... - B.I.

1093
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:05,890
B.I will try.

1094
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:06,960
Let's go.

1095
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:08,620
They might be better. They're both guys.

1096
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:10,060
- Ready. - Let's do this.

1097
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,060
Go.

1098
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:12,685
(Se Chan and B.I start.)

1099
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,770
(Se Chan is holding the cup, and B.I is spinning.)

1100
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:18,770
(They seem to be serious about the mission.)

1101
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:20,600
He's getting dizzy. Eight.

1102
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:21,770
Nine.

1103
00:40:21,776 --> 00:40:22,910
Let's do this.

1104
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,210
(They're going to make use of their speed and athletic abilities.)

1105
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:25,310
- 9. - 9.

1106
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:26,410
- 10. - 10.

1107
00:40:26,414 --> 00:40:29,310
(He approaches the bowl.)

1108
00:40:29,316 --> 00:40:31,505
(He rolls.)

1109
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,350
(When someone lies down during a mission,)

1110
00:40:34,355 --> 00:40:37,545
(you should play their new song.)

1111
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:39,360
This is too much.

1112
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,290
(This is the perfect moment to promote "Killing Me".)

1113
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:42,960
(Good job, B.I.)

1114
00:40:42,963 --> 00:40:44,590
Look at him.

1115
00:40:44,598 --> 00:40:46,155
Gosh.

1116
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,800
What is this?

1117
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,055
Some people feel dizzy very easily.

1118
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:51,600
Gosh.

1119
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:52,640
Did I get some in?

1120
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,340
- You spilled everything. - I'm sorry.

1121
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:55,370
His cochlea...

1122
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,640
Sit down and rest.

1123
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:57,910
- Take a break. - Take a break.

1124
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:59,180
Let us try.

1125
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,980
- Today... - Okay.

1126
00:41:00,981 --> 00:41:02,580
- Let's win. - Well...

1127
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,710
Ji Min is going to compete...

1128
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,120
in a show this fall.

1129
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:09,105
Start.

1130
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:11,520
(She spins very quickly.)

1131
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:12,620
She's fast.

1132
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:14,890
- 4, 5... - 4, 5...

1133
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:16,730
(You're doing great.)

1134
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:19,930
- Where is my cup? - 7, 8...

1135
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:21,730
(Seok Jin forgot his cup.)

1136
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,270
Give me a cup! I forgot my cup.

1137
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:26,640
- Give me a cup! - Just continue!

1138
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,140
(They're not allowed to stop once they start.)

1139
00:41:29,143 --> 00:41:32,040
- I forgot my cup. - Grab the bowl!

1140
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:35,680
(Ji Min keeps spinning without realizing what's going on.)

1141
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:36,750
- Grab the bowl! - Give me a cup!

1142
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:38,850
(She has to grab the bowl.)

1143
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:40,350
5, 4...

1144
00:41:40,354 --> 00:41:41,520
Give me a cup!

1145
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:42,690
(I need a cup to hold the water.)

1146
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,145
Give me a cup!

1147
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:47,560
(The other members keep track of time.)

1148
00:41:47,561 --> 00:41:48,820
(What?)

1149
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:51,060
(You have no cup?)

1150
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:54,655
(Why don't you?)

1151
00:41:54,769 --> 00:41:56,600
(Ji Min splashes the water on Seok Jin's face.)

1152
00:41:56,604 --> 00:41:58,955
- I don't have a cup! - Why don't you have a cup?

1153
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,400
(He makes everyone laugh by forgetting his cup.)

1154
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:02,770
He has no cup.

1155
00:42:02,777 --> 00:42:04,640
Here's your cup.

1156
00:42:04,645 --> 00:42:06,080
I don't need it anymore.

1157
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,780
(Angry)

1158
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:10,765
Just do something with it. Put your booger in it or something.

1159
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,080
Did your booger come out?

1160
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:14,205
You should get your cup yourself.

1161
00:42:14,221 --> 00:42:15,680
It's Seok Jin's fault.

1162
00:42:15,689 --> 00:42:17,450
- You should get your cup. - Think about it.

1163
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:20,360
Seok Jin is playing the game. Who else would get him the cup?

1164
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:25,085
(The nation's favorite host wipes the floor.)

1165
00:42:25,232 --> 00:42:27,515
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1166
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:29,855
Someone might slip.

1167
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:32,870
(He's so thoughtful.)

1168
00:42:32,873 --> 00:42:34,000
He's so thoughtful.

1169
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:36,870
(Is that why he's so popular?)

1170
00:42:36,877 --> 00:42:39,780
(I don't want my colleagues to get hurt.)

1171
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,180
Don't air this.

1172
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:44,680
(Seok Jin feels grumpy.)

1173
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:48,180
- What are you doing? - It's part of my contract.

1174
00:42:48,189 --> 00:42:50,350
Something like this has to be included...

1175
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,050
- in every episode. - It has to air?

1176
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:54,160
- Yes. - That's a good idea.

1177
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:55,790
You being kind?

1178
00:42:55,796 --> 00:42:57,060
- They have to show your kindness? - Yes.

1179
00:42:57,064 --> 00:43:00,055
- It's part of the contract. - They have to air it.

1180
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,615
Don't air it. I don't want him to look good.

1181
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:04,600
It'd make him look too nice.

1182
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:06,055
Ready.

1183
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,895
Go.

1184
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:10,040
- Ju Yeon has never done this. - 1, 2...

1185
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:11,140
- Three. - You're doing great.

1186
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:13,080
(You're doing great, Ju Yeon.)

1187
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,810
- 7, 8... - 7, 8...

1188
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,710
(She is fast and stable.)

1189
00:43:16,717 --> 00:43:18,950
Go. Hurry up. 5, 4...

1190
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:20,250
Come here.

1191
00:43:20,254 --> 00:43:21,980
Just come here.

1192
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:23,620
Here we go.

1193
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:25,020
Let's do this!

1194
00:43:25,025 --> 00:43:28,045
- Hold him. - 5, 4, 3...

1195
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:30,185
Here we go!

1196
00:43:30,664 --> 00:43:31,660
Here we go!

1197
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:34,185
(Pouring)

1198
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,470
(Ju Yeon disappears.)

1199
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,730
She poured a lot.

1200
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:38,830
(Incredible)

1201
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:40,240
She did pour some into the cup.

1202
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:43,065
(The cup is almost half full.)

1203
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:45,880
(After pouring the water into the cup,)

1204
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,580
(Ju Yeon disappeared.)

1205
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,550
(She falls.)

1206
00:43:50,551 --> 00:43:51,580
Hold on.

1207
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:53,480
(She is forced to take a break in the corner.)

1208
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:54,580
Are you okay?

1209
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,875
- She poured some into the cup. - Ju Yeon.

1210
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:58,250
Here we go!

1211
00:43:58,259 --> 00:43:59,660
(At a moment like this, your own song is the best medicine.)

1212
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,515
(This will give her energy.)

1213
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:07,560
(I'm your diva, diva, di, di, diva)

1214
00:44:07,568 --> 00:44:08,700
I mean...

1215
00:44:08,702 --> 00:44:10,270
You did a good job.

1216
00:44:10,271 --> 00:44:11,430
Are we in first place?

1217
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:13,095
(Jong Kook and Ju Yeon are far ahead of the others.)

1218
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:15,395
Seung Ri and So Min.

1219
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,725
Please mimic G-Dragon.

1220
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,065
(The impression vending machine is on.)

1221
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,510
(If I could see you)

1222
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:28,520
(Are you watching from the White Skull Infantry Division?)

1223
00:44:28,522 --> 00:44:29,975
He's good.

1224
00:44:30,457 --> 00:44:33,960
(Even if I lose everything)

1225
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:38,515
(It's okay)

1226
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:40,400
(It's funny every time.)

1227
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,970
G-Dragon must be so annoyed watching this on TV.

1228
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,770
- The White Skull Infantry Division? - Where's the camera?

1229
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:47,295
White Skull Infantry Division. Salute.

1230
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,200
I apologize. I'm sorry.

1231
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,140
(White Skull Infantry Division, I apologize.)

1232
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:52,880
- What did you just say? - What did he say?

1233
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,980
I apologized to the White Skull Infantry Division.

1234
00:44:53,981 --> 00:44:55,435
You apologized?

1235
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:56,980
Please put subtitles.

1236
00:44:56,984 --> 00:45:00,750
"White Skull Infantry Division, I apologize."

1237
00:45:00,754 --> 00:45:05,505
(After the video message, So Min and Seung Ri start.)

1238
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:08,315
(That's quite a bit of water.)

1239
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:09,960
That's Haha.

1240
00:45:09,964 --> 00:45:11,660
That's Identity Change.

1241
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:14,315
(So Min turns into Identity Change.)

1242
00:45:15,002 --> 00:45:16,200
(Jae Seok and Xi A try.)

1243
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:17,470
- She's done. - She's good.

1244
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:19,270
She's very good.

1245
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:20,640
She's so calm.

1246
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:22,400
(She spills almost no water.)

1247
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,040
This is incredible. Aren't you dizzy?

1248
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:26,380
Not really.

1249
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:27,780
(Jong Kook, Ju Yeon, Jae Seok, and Xi A are leading.)

1250
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:30,350
As this is Elijah's specialty, she should be the best.

1251
00:45:30,351 --> 00:45:32,305
Start.

1252
00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:35,350
- 1, 2, 3... - She's fast.

1253
00:45:35,356 --> 00:45:36,890
(Will she be able to protect her pride?)

1254
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:38,520
- 6, 7... - 6, 7...

1255
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:39,960
(Show us your skills!)

1256
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,390
- She's doing great. - Nine.

1257
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:43,160
(She's done spinning 10 times.)

1258
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,830
- Behind you. - One...

1259
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:46,100
(She grabs the bowl.)

1260
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,430
Pour it into the cup!

1261
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:49,260
(She just has to pour it.)

1262
00:45:49,269 --> 00:45:50,470
Pour it!

1263
00:45:50,471 --> 00:45:52,870
(Will Elijah beat Xi A and Ju Yeon?)

1264
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:55,495
4, 5.

1265
00:45:56,043 --> 00:45:57,540
(She approaches Kwang Soo...)

1266
00:45:57,544 --> 00:46:00,710
(and pours the water on him.)

1267
00:46:00,714 --> 00:46:02,950
(You're spilling a lot.)

1268
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,750
She poured a lot into the cup.

1269
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:06,180
How much water...

1270
00:46:06,186 --> 00:46:07,320
(She spilled a lot too.)

1271
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:08,450
It's quite a lot.

1272
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:10,520
(But she managed to pour quite a lot into the cup.)

1273
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,890
(Did she pour more into the cup than Xi A and Ju Yeon did?)

1274
00:46:12,893 --> 00:46:15,215
What's the result?

1275
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:18,990
(Kwang Soo and Elijah clearly win.)

1276
00:46:18,999 --> 00:46:20,600
- Elijah wins. - Okay!

1277
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,100
(Your sense of balance is immaculate!)

1278
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:23,500
Gosh.

1279
00:46:23,504 --> 00:46:24,500
(We did well too.)

1280
00:46:24,505 --> 00:46:25,770
I finally won in something.

1281
00:46:25,773 --> 00:46:28,195
(Kwang Soo and Elijah win the balance competition.)

1282
00:46:28,409 --> 00:46:29,870
(The pawnshop is closed.)

1283
00:46:29,877 --> 00:46:32,270
Are you ready? Let's see the result.

1284
00:46:32,279 --> 00:46:34,535
(What's the pawnshop's verdict?)

1285
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:38,350
(Jae Seok and Xi A can pay off 30 dollars.)

1286
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:40,350
- Haha and Sun Mi... - Sun Mi, we won 16 dollars.

1287
00:46:40,354 --> 00:46:42,120
- Okay! - So Min and Seung Ri, nine dollars.

1288
00:46:42,122 --> 00:46:44,020
Why did we win just nine dollars?

1289
00:46:44,024 --> 00:46:46,160
We won the dance battle.

1290
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,460
Why did we win just nine dollars? We won.

1291
00:46:48,462 --> 00:46:49,960
- We won. - We won the dance battle.

1292
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:51,160
Has the amount been written off?

1293
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:52,490
Thank you.

1294
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:54,100
(We're in 1st place.)

1295
00:46:54,101 --> 00:46:55,660
- Say it. - Beg them.

1296
00:46:55,669 --> 00:46:57,200
(No problem. Good luck with your next mission.)

1297
00:46:57,204 --> 00:46:59,330
- I'm excited. - There's only 20 dollars left.

1298
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,940
(They divide into two groups and go for lunch.)

1299
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:06,980
(Debt Amounts)

1300
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,435
- It looks so tasty. - It smells so good.

1301
00:47:10,484 --> 00:47:12,565
This place looks so good.

1302
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,835
- Sit here, Ji Min. - Okay.

1303
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:17,690
- Smell that. - It smells so good.

1304
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:20,560
This mission involves opportunities...

1305
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:22,560
to write off debt and receive free meal cards.

1306
00:47:22,563 --> 00:47:23,930
(It's 1 shot, 2 kills.)

1307
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,285
We must win.

1308
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,100
It's called Couple Survey: Love Scenario.

1309
00:47:28,102 --> 00:47:30,270
(Couple Survey: Love Scenario)

1310
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,270
"Love Scenario"? I love it.

1311
00:47:32,272 --> 00:47:34,000
The love experts are...

1312
00:47:34,007 --> 00:47:35,270
- Kwang Soo and So Min. - Yes,

1313
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:36,770
- I'm confident. - Me too.

1314
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:39,480
There are two survey questions that unmarried men and women...

1315
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,950
- in their 20s and 30s answered. - 20s and 30s?

1316
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,320
You win if you rank 1 to 5 correctly.

1317
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,980
- Is that right? - You'll be awarded...

1318
00:47:47,988 --> 00:47:50,205
according to which answers you get right.

1319
00:47:50,691 --> 00:47:51,950
I have to get them right.

1320
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:53,360
This is awesome.

1321
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,330
If you answer the question wrong,

1322
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,730
the couple next to you will doodle nicely on your face.

1323
00:47:58,732 --> 00:48:01,300
(If you answer wrong, the couple next to you will draw on your face.)

1324
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,360
Nice.

1325
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,870
No way.

1326
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:06,700
Here's the first question.

1327
00:48:06,707 --> 00:48:09,895
"What did you lie about the most to your lover?"

1328
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:12,470
- A lie? - That's okay too.

1329
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:13,710
"I love you."

1330
00:48:13,714 --> 00:48:15,140
(Whispering)

1331
00:48:15,149 --> 00:48:16,480
I don't think so.

1332
00:48:16,483 --> 00:48:18,350
Answer... Answer.

1333
00:48:18,352 --> 00:48:20,720
If it's wrong, we'll draw on your face.

1334
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,520
- Go ahead. - "You're the first."

1335
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:26,790
(Seung Ri's answer: "You're the first.")

1336
00:48:26,793 --> 00:48:28,675
- He's right. - It's there.

1337
00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:30,185
Correct.

1338
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,560
Really?

1339
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:33,855
- You dated many women. - It was...

1340
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:35,200
number two.

1341
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:36,330
- Yes. - Number two?

1342
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:38,555
(Number 2: "You're the first.")

1343
00:48:38,605 --> 00:48:40,625
- That's four dollars. - Yes!

1344
00:48:40,774 --> 00:48:42,100
How did you know?

1345
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:44,210
Don't people say this a lot?

1346
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:46,070
- Did you say it a lot? - No.

1347
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,310
I guess it wasn't your first.

1348
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:48,680
I've never said this before.

1349
00:48:48,682 --> 00:48:51,850
There's no point mentioning about the past.

1350
00:48:51,852 --> 00:48:54,020
Rather than that,

1351
00:48:54,021 --> 00:48:56,120
I thought it was saying you've never been to a place when you have.

1352
00:48:56,123 --> 00:48:58,290
- That's right. - That's possible.

1353
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:01,290
That's how some people watch the same movie twice.

1354
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:02,720
Like it's the first time.

1355
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:03,890
Like watching old movies?

1356
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:05,090
- Answer. - Mention that one.

1357
00:49:05,098 --> 00:49:06,090
(She's confident.)

1358
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:08,230
- This is number 1. - Number 1.

1359
00:49:08,235 --> 00:49:10,070
- "I love you." - It has to be there.

1360
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:12,100
(Ji Min's answer: "I love you.")

1361
00:49:12,105 --> 00:49:14,440
- That's a lie? - How's that a lie?

1362
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:17,310
Xi A mentioned this too, but I said it wasn't right.

1363
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,540
It's there, right?

1364
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:19,680
Number one, "I love you."

1365
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,335
(She's correct.)

1366
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:24,580
- Really? - Yes!

1367
00:49:24,585 --> 00:49:26,420
(Number 1: "I love you.")

1368
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,135
I've heard that a lot. "I love you."

1369
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:31,620
Nice. It's a lie.

1370
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:34,915
Did they all lie to me then?

1371
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:37,960
Men usually say it...

1372
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:39,490
when they do something wrong.

1373
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:42,100
- It's a lie. - Right.

1374
00:49:42,102 --> 00:49:45,125
- You're an expert. - I'm a love expert.

1375
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:46,740
I've heard that so many times.

1376
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,125
Answer.

1377
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:50,565
- Answer? - Answer.

1378
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:52,565
"I was busy."

1379
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,210
- This isn't it. - She'll get the penalty.

1380
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:57,680
(She has a feeling.)

1381
00:49:57,684 --> 00:49:58,750
- Why? - She's getting the penalty.

1382
00:49:58,752 --> 00:50:00,180
Because...

1383
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:02,350
- So Min. - Why? Why isn't it there?

1384
00:50:02,356 --> 00:50:04,350
- It'll be simple. - "I'm home."

1385
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:05,690
Stop it.

1386
00:50:05,692 --> 00:50:07,115
Let's see.

1387
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:08,520
"I'm home."

1388
00:50:08,528 --> 00:50:10,185
It suits her.

1389
00:50:11,398 --> 00:50:14,230
(It's simple.)

1390
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,600
(The love expert has a spot on her face.)

1391
00:50:16,603 --> 00:50:17,600
It suits her.

1392
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:19,485
Our turn. Answer.

1393
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,770
- Go ahead. - Answer.

1394
00:50:21,775 --> 00:50:24,140
"You're the prettiest person in the world."

1395
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:25,470
- It has to be there. - It is.

1396
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:27,780
"You're the prettiest person in the world."

1397
00:50:27,781 --> 00:50:29,795
"You're the most handsome."

1398
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:31,580
Okay.

1399
00:50:31,585 --> 00:50:32,610
(Xi A's answer: "You're the prettiest person in the world.")

1400
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:34,680
I knew it. I think it's number three.

1401
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:35,850
All right.

1402
00:50:35,856 --> 00:50:37,890
- Really? - I feel...

1403
00:50:37,891 --> 00:50:40,390
- a little sad about this answer. - I know.

1404
00:50:40,394 --> 00:50:43,160
- They all lied to me. - How could they lie?

1405
00:50:43,163 --> 00:50:44,330
This hurts.

1406
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:45,945
"I'm tired of this."

1407
00:50:46,433 --> 00:50:48,185
Answer. "I'm sorry."

1408
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:51,100
(So Min's answer: "I'm sorry.")

1409
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:52,370
I don't think so.

1410
00:50:52,372 --> 00:50:54,370
Why? Why?

1411
00:50:54,374 --> 00:50:56,270
(Am I wrong again?)

1412
00:50:56,276 --> 00:50:57,440
Why not?

1413
00:50:57,444 --> 00:50:59,995
Come here.

1414
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:01,480
Answer.

1415
00:51:01,481 --> 00:51:02,840
(I'll step up.)

1416
00:51:02,849 --> 00:51:05,950
You scared me.

1417
00:51:05,952 --> 00:51:07,950
- What? - What is that?

1418
00:51:07,954 --> 00:51:10,805
- I'm going to get her glasses. - I see.

1419
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:13,020
- I only got her one lens. - Okay.

1420
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,120
I'll get her glasses.

1421
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:16,015
You'll get it soon.

1422
00:51:16,663 --> 00:51:18,730
"Your food is the best."

1423
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:19,930
- That's not it. - That's not.

1424
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:21,830
- It's not there. - He...

1425
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:23,600
doesn't know anything.

1426
00:51:23,603 --> 00:51:24,730
(This isn't it?)

1427
00:51:24,738 --> 00:51:26,085
He doesn't know.

1428
00:51:26,373 --> 00:51:27,940
I'm confused because they're in their 20s and 30s.

1429
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:31,295
During our time, it's like "My manager's father passed away."

1430
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:32,810
(What did his manager's father do?)

1431
00:51:32,813 --> 00:51:33,910
I know that one.

1432
00:51:33,914 --> 00:51:36,080
But I'm not sure about those in their 20s and 30s.

1433
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,605
There are so many things.

1434
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:39,565
Don't stick your tongue out.

1435
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,605
Answer.

1436
00:51:42,356 --> 00:51:43,750
He must be so cold.

1437
00:51:43,757 --> 00:51:44,790
Answer.

1438
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,405
That's so scary.

1439
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,960
- What's this? - It's pretty, Kwang Soo.

1440
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:51,415
- It's Ms. Kwang Soo. - We have the answer.

1441
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:53,400
Answer.

1442
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,930
"I'll be home early today."

1443
00:51:54,935 --> 00:51:56,260
(Xi A's answer: "I'll be home early today.")

1444
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:58,000
That's after you move in together.

1445
00:51:58,004 --> 00:51:59,625
Doodle on her face.

1446
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,600
(She never got doodled on her face before.)

1447
00:52:01,608 --> 00:52:03,495
I don't think she's ever done this before.

1448
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:05,540
I've never seen that done to a woman.

1449
00:52:05,545 --> 00:52:07,265
That's too much.

1450
00:52:07,714 --> 00:52:09,310
That's too much.

1451
00:52:09,316 --> 00:52:10,850
Isn't this too much?

1452
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:12,210
- So Min. - Hey.

1453
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:13,850
(She clenches her teeth.)

1454
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:17,390
- She looks like a witch. - This is too much.

1455
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:19,505
Her nostrils look that big.

1456
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:22,460
- What's wrong with your lips? - My lips?

1457
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:24,230
- Why? - What's wrong with them?

1458
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,315
(Kwang Soo, So Min, and Xi A get penalties.)

1459
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:27,900
Answer.

1460
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:29,315
It has to be right.

1461
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:31,100
"I went to bed early."

1462
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,270
(Ji Min's answer: "I went to bed early.")

1463
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:34,000
(Incorrect)

1464
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:35,000
(The love expert surrenders.)

1465
00:52:35,008 --> 00:52:36,710
- "I miss you." - Hold on.

1466
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:38,640
Blackheads on his nose.

1467
00:52:38,645 --> 00:52:40,235
"You're the only one."

1468
00:52:40,714 --> 00:52:42,480
I already had that.

1469
00:52:42,482 --> 00:52:43,810
(They look funnier over time.)

1470
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:46,620
Number 4 and 5 are usually hard to guess.

1471
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,105
- Answer. - Answer?

1472
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:50,020
"I don't have any money."

1473
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:51,450
(Kwang Soo's answer: "I don't have any money.")

1474
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:52,550
(Incorrect)

1475
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,460
You don't know people in their 20s and 30s at all.

1476
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:59,190
- I said that a lot when I was 20. - Aren't you in your 30s?

1477
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,455
These people are in their 20s and 30s.

1478
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:04,570
So Min, is Kwang Soo going to be in a cartoon?

1479
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:06,330
What are you doing to me?

1480
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:07,540
Is he going to be in a cartoon?

1481
00:53:07,541 --> 00:53:09,540
Kwang Soo, you look very angry.

1482
00:53:09,543 --> 00:53:12,640
I'm mad.

1483
00:53:12,646 --> 00:53:14,165
- Answer. - Answer?

1484
00:53:14,815 --> 00:53:16,310
"Let's get married in the future."

1485
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:17,480
(So Min's answer: "Let's get married in the future.")

1486
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:18,610
I don't think so.

1487
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:19,750
Really?

1488
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:21,620
(She's correct.)

1489
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:24,120
It's 20s and 30s. You say that a lot when you're young.

1490
00:53:24,124 --> 00:53:25,350
- "Let's get married." - It's number four.

1491
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:27,815
(Number 4: "I'm going to marry you.")

1492
00:53:28,361 --> 00:53:30,430
- You're a love expert. - Because...

1493
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:33,285
I married 3 guys in my 20s.

1494
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,360
(There's only number 5 left.)

1495
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:37,955
- Answer. - Answer. I went first.

1496
00:53:39,272 --> 00:53:41,295
Men say this a lot.

1497
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,810
"I have time."

1498
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,540
(This is his answer.)

1499
00:53:46,546 --> 00:53:47,910
(What do you mean?)

1500
00:53:47,914 --> 00:53:52,850
Goodness. You're so old. You're so old.

1501
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:54,120
"I have time."

1502
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,590
- You're so old. - "I have time"?

1503
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,745
(Concentrating)

1504
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:01,415
Your nose hairs are sticking out.

1505
00:54:02,062 --> 00:54:03,660
They're sticking out too much.

1506
00:54:03,663 --> 00:54:06,685
(His nose hairs stick out.)

1507
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,715
You should erase it when we eat. I'll lose my appetite.

1508
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,130
You should erase it when we start eating.

1509
00:54:12,138 --> 00:54:13,270
Gosh, you guys.

1510
00:54:13,273 --> 00:54:14,695
Answer.

1511
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:17,765
"What's wrong? She's just a friend."

1512
00:54:18,144 --> 00:54:19,570
- People in their 40s? - "She's a female friend."

1513
00:54:19,579 --> 00:54:21,040
- "She's a female friend." - People in their 30s and 40s.

1514
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:22,435
(Incorrect)

1515
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:25,150
Seok Jin,

1516
00:54:25,151 --> 00:54:27,350
- you can't even pay money for this. - What is it?

1517
00:54:27,354 --> 00:54:29,375
You have glasses now.

1518
00:54:30,123 --> 00:54:31,605
- Doesn't it look good? - It suits him.

1519
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,020
It's not bad.

1520
00:54:33,026 --> 00:54:35,245
- It's not bad at all. - Doesn't it suit him?

1521
00:54:36,162 --> 00:54:37,730
- It suits him. - Seok Jin,

1522
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:39,430
you should do this at home.

1523
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:42,560
- I need eyebrows. Thank you. - You don't need any makeup.

1524
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,570
This one's kind of hard.

1525
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:46,000
- Let me give you a hint. - Okay.

1526
00:54:46,006 --> 00:54:50,870
This is what an older man says a lot to a younger woman.

1527
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:53,465
- Answer. - Me!

1528
00:54:55,782 --> 00:54:57,780
This one's kind of hard.

1529
00:54:57,784 --> 00:54:59,210
- Let me give you a hint. - Okay.

1530
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:04,090
This is what an older man says a lot to a younger woman.

1531
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,675
- Answer. - Me!

1532
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:08,590
Answer. "Do you trust me?"

1533
00:55:08,595 --> 00:55:10,260
(Jae Seok's answer: "Do you trust me?")

1534
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:11,860
- All right. - That's what I had too.

1535
00:55:11,865 --> 00:55:13,545
(Correct)

1536
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,660
Good job.

1537
00:55:14,668 --> 00:55:15,800
- "Do you trust me?" - Me too.

1538
00:55:15,802 --> 00:55:17,930
(Number 5: "Trust me.")

1539
00:55:17,938 --> 00:55:20,570
This is a close match.

1540
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:21,840
We didn't get any right.

1541
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:23,740
- We'll write off our debt. - This is so hard.

1542
00:55:23,743 --> 00:55:25,210
We're in first place.

1543
00:55:25,211 --> 00:55:26,270
(So Min and Seung Ri lead with 6 dollars.)

1544
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:27,980
You must be hungry.

1545
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:32,410
This mission is called Couple Telepathy: 1, 2, 3.

1546
00:55:32,419 --> 00:55:34,050
(Couple Telepathy: 1, 2, 3)

1547
00:55:34,054 --> 00:55:35,550
"Couple Telepathy".

1548
00:55:35,555 --> 00:55:36,720
What's that?

1549
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:38,220
"Couple Telepathy".

1550
00:55:38,224 --> 00:55:41,490
The couples stand on three boards...

1551
00:55:41,494 --> 00:55:45,360
and must produce the same gesture according to the given word.

1552
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:49,160
If you don't match, one board gets removed.

1553
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:52,630
You get graded payments according to the order you survive.

1554
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:53,940
We must win.

1555
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,970
If your arms are in the opposite directions, it's wrong.

1556
00:55:55,976 --> 00:55:57,410
- Okay. - Really?

1557
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:59,510
- Let's use our right hands. - Okay.

1558
00:55:59,512 --> 00:56:02,280
Don't use your legs. Only use your arms.

1559
00:56:02,282 --> 00:56:03,510
Let's get started.

1560
00:56:03,516 --> 00:56:06,050
(First word)

1561
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,950
"Heart". 1, 2, 3.

1562
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:11,320
(First word: "heart")

1563
00:56:11,324 --> 00:56:12,745
(Looking around)

1564
00:56:13,093 --> 00:56:14,960
They're using different arms.

1565
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:17,260
(He tells the producer.)

1566
00:56:17,263 --> 00:56:19,190
- What's that? - What?

1567
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,660
- Isn't that wrong? - Hold on.

1568
00:56:20,667 --> 00:56:23,555
- You're using your right hand. - I'm right.

1569
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:25,800
- That's wrong. - It's wrong. Let's take one out.

1570
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:27,470
Look. How's this not a heart?

1571
00:56:27,474 --> 00:56:29,200
Step away from each other.

1572
00:56:29,209 --> 00:56:30,840
- Is that the heart? - Those two are different.

1573
00:56:30,844 --> 00:56:32,195
Your arms are different.

1574
00:56:32,512 --> 00:56:36,040
- How more couple-like can we get? - This is not fair.

1575
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:37,680
I'm disappointed.

1576
00:56:37,684 --> 00:56:40,675
- That's part of the game. - All right.

1577
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:43,235
- This is not fair. - Here's the second question.

1578
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,490
"Sun Mi". 1, 2, 3.

1579
00:56:46,493 --> 00:56:49,415
(Second word: "Sun Mi")

1580
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:54,785
(It has to be the gun dance.)

1581
00:56:55,268 --> 00:56:58,030
(What gestures will they do?)

1582
00:56:58,038 --> 00:57:00,200
(Oh, dear.)

1583
00:57:00,206 --> 00:57:02,370
- This is perfect. - We got it right.

1584
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,010
Why?

1585
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,825
What's wrong with this?

1586
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,510
She's wrong. You have to be accurate.

1587
00:57:08,515 --> 00:57:10,050
She's wrong. We'll take one out.

1588
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:12,150
Doesn't Sun Mi use one hand?

1589
00:57:12,152 --> 00:57:13,310
What happened with them?

1590
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:15,975
(We're saved.)

1591
00:57:16,322 --> 00:57:19,390
Don't old people use two hands?

1592
00:57:19,392 --> 00:57:22,090
Hey, she's the only one who did that.

1593
00:57:22,095 --> 00:57:23,430
(She's an oldie.)

1594
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,890
Let's get started again.

1595
00:57:24,898 --> 00:57:26,590
"Selfie pose". 1, 2, 3.

1596
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,555
(Next word: "selfie pose")

1597
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,655
This is perfect.

1598
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:34,570
- We did it. - Ju Yeon,

1599
00:57:34,574 --> 00:57:38,065
you were late, and the hand gestures are totally different.

1600
00:57:38,111 --> 00:57:40,610
Haha, what's that? That's an old phone.

1601
00:57:40,613 --> 00:57:42,335
- Haha. - Why?

1602
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,365
Haha is wrong too.

1603
00:57:45,685 --> 00:57:48,950
Come on, Ju Yeon. Hold on. 1, 2, 3.

1604
00:57:48,955 --> 00:57:50,320
(Hopping)

1605
00:57:50,323 --> 00:57:53,075
Hey, she's like a feather.

1606
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,275
(He's carrying her on his back.)

1607
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,260
You're the bomb.

1608
00:57:58,264 --> 00:58:00,130
(She's happy.)

1609
00:58:00,133 --> 00:58:02,300
"Bomb"? Stop it.

1610
00:58:02,302 --> 00:58:05,055
- Stop it. - You sound old.

1611
00:58:05,371 --> 00:58:07,570
- Don't say that. - Can we move on?

1612
00:58:07,574 --> 00:58:08,570
He's the bomb.

1613
00:58:08,575 --> 00:58:10,310
Why am I getting nervous?

1614
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,840
Right hand.

1615
00:58:11,845 --> 00:58:13,525
Ready...

1616
00:58:13,847 --> 00:58:15,580
"Acting cute". 1, 2, 3.

1617
00:58:15,582 --> 00:58:17,150
(Next word: "acting cute")

1618
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:21,220
(They only have one board left. They have to get this right.)

1619
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:24,475
(They matched.)

1620
00:58:26,726 --> 00:58:28,860
- This is awesome, Sun Mi. - I'm sorry.

1621
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:32,015
- B.I... - This is awesome, Sun Mi.

1622
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:35,655
- This is awesome. - I'm getting goosebumps.

1623
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:38,570
(How are you matching?)

1624
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:39,570
This is acting cute.

1625
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:41,470
(We're acting cute.)

1626
00:58:41,474 --> 00:58:43,100
- This is cute. - We're acting cute.

1627
00:58:43,109 --> 00:58:44,910
Didn't they plan this ahead of time?

1628
00:58:44,911 --> 00:58:46,780
- No way. - What are you talking about?

1629
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,410
Do "acting cute". 1, 2, 3.

1630
00:58:48,414 --> 00:58:49,940
(Isn't this acting cute?)

1631
00:58:49,949 --> 00:58:52,280
- How's that cute? - How is that it?

1632
00:58:52,285 --> 00:58:54,905
You can look up "acting cute". This isn't there.

1633
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:58,220
- This is right. - This is cute in Northern Europe.

1634
00:58:58,224 --> 00:59:00,245
(He went too far.)

1635
00:59:00,593 --> 00:59:02,720
He says that's cute in Northern Europe.

1636
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:04,390
This is a warning. If you do this again,

1637
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:07,045
- you'll get a board taken away. - All right.

1638
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,200
Here's the second question.

1639
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:11,925
"The worst thing to say to turn down a blind date."

1640
00:59:12,071 --> 00:59:14,470
- "Turn down"? - "Turn down."

1641
00:59:14,474 --> 00:59:16,910
- "Turn down"? - Answer.

1642
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,565
(I'll get it right this time.)

1643
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:20,580
(She gets ready to draw on his face.)

1644
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:23,850
"I'm sorry. I'm married already."

1645
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,950
- What? - That's the worst.

1646
00:59:25,952 --> 00:59:28,475
- You're the worst right now. - No, wait.

1647
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:30,990
(This is what he gets for it.)

1648
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:33,590
You got a nosebleed. Hey, wipe your nose.

1649
00:59:33,593 --> 00:59:36,420
Am I getting a nosebleed?

1650
00:59:36,429 --> 00:59:38,115
(It makes him sad.)

1651
00:59:38,131 --> 00:59:39,990
Answer. "You're not my type."

1652
00:59:39,999 --> 00:59:42,360
(Seung Ri's answer: "You're not my type.")

1653
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:43,970
- It's there. - Really?

1654
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,370
(Correct)

1655
00:59:45,371 --> 00:59:46,470
- Really? - That's being honest.

1656
00:59:46,472 --> 00:59:48,700
"You're a great person, but you're not my type."

1657
00:59:48,708 --> 00:59:50,965
(Number 3: "You're a great person, but you're not my style.")

1658
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,110
- It's along that line. - Right.

1659
00:59:53,112 --> 00:59:55,410
- Answer. - Let's go, Ji Min.

1660
00:59:55,415 --> 00:59:58,910
"I'm sorry. I don't carry my phone around, so I replied late."

1661
00:59:58,918 --> 01:00:00,950
That's not turning them down.

1662
01:00:00,954 --> 01:00:03,835
- The title is different. - You're not turning them down.

1663
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,090
- Really? - Is she right?

1664
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:06,960
(Correct)

1665
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,490
- That's an answer? - It's number one.

1666
01:00:08,494 --> 01:00:09,975
- It's number one. - Really?

1667
01:00:09,996 --> 01:00:11,515
- Really? - Yes.

1668
01:00:12,365 --> 01:00:13,490
You were right on it.

1669
01:00:13,499 --> 01:00:15,755
(Number 1: "I don't usually look at my phone.")

1670
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:18,225
Ji Min is awesome.

1671
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:21,070
- Turning down... - Answer!

1672
01:00:21,074 --> 01:00:22,555
(They shout out at the same time.)

1673
01:00:23,009 --> 01:00:25,210
I have an answer. What should we do?

1674
01:00:25,211 --> 01:00:26,825
So Min first.

1675
01:00:27,513 --> 01:00:31,105
"This is too much for me." It has to be there.

1676
01:00:31,117 --> 01:00:32,410
It is.

1677
01:00:32,418 --> 01:00:33,720
- Why? - It's not. Come here.

1678
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,120
(Incorrect)

1679
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,790
- Hold on. - They said that a lot.

1680
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:40,090
Right? "This is too much for me to handle."

1681
01:00:40,093 --> 01:00:42,090
This is strange. Are they not from our time?

1682
01:00:42,095 --> 01:00:44,230
What's that? Is that snot?

1683
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,085
Is that squid ink?

1684
01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:48,100
She has a lot of nose hair.

1685
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:51,725
Answer. "I'm sorry, but I'd rather be alone."

1686
01:00:51,804 --> 01:00:54,240
You don't want to date. "I'd rather be alone."

1687
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,640
- "I'd rather be alone." - I'll take that.

1688
01:00:56,643 --> 01:00:58,210
I was going to do that.

1689
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,865
(Correct)

1690
01:01:00,113 --> 01:01:02,195
- It's number two. - It is?

1691
01:01:02,515 --> 01:01:04,880
I knew it. I was going to do that.

1692
01:01:04,884 --> 01:01:06,810
You're not ready to date anybody.

1693
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:08,050
Nice.

1694
01:01:08,054 --> 01:01:09,675
(Seung Ri did it.)

1695
01:01:09,822 --> 01:01:11,475
I was going to do that.

1696
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:12,850
Answer.

1697
01:01:12,859 --> 01:01:14,860
(I'll get this one.)

1698
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:18,530
"I'm not..." Well, how should I put it?

1699
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:20,600
Jae Seok, please cut your nose hairs before you speak.

1700
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,460
(Please cut your nose hairs before you speak.)

1701
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:26,300
- It's fine to be serious. - Stop it.

1702
01:01:26,306 --> 01:01:28,570
- I mean... - I'm talking right now.

1703
01:01:28,574 --> 01:01:30,765
- Sorry. - "I'm..."

1704
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,365
"busy right now."

1705
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:35,265
- I think it's there. - "I'm sorry, but I'm busy."

1706
01:01:35,281 --> 01:01:36,610
- Is it not right? - "I'm kind of busy."

1707
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:38,610
- I'll take that. - Really?

1708
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:39,610
(Correct)

1709
01:01:39,619 --> 01:01:42,480
- That's right. - I'm excited.

1710
01:01:42,488 --> 01:01:44,390
- "I'm busy." - This one's very similar too.

1711
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,220
Number five is very close to this.

1712
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:47,575
Answer!

1713
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:49,515
(Okay, I got it.)

1714
01:01:50,096 --> 01:01:53,945
(Jae Seok again?)

1715
01:01:54,133 --> 01:01:58,155
"I'm busy because of a business trip."

1716
01:01:58,204 --> 01:02:00,070
- What do you mean? - Answer!

1717
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:01,495
Go ahead.

1718
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,210
(Smiling)

1719
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:06,765
You tore your lips.

1720
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:09,280
He's smiling too widely.

1721
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:12,610
You're Joker from "Batman".

1722
01:02:12,618 --> 01:02:14,420
(He has big nose hairs unlike the charismatic Joker.)

1723
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:15,875
Answer.

1724
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:18,320
Get ready.

1725
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:20,590
"I have so much on my plate."

1726
01:02:20,593 --> 01:02:23,220
(Jae Seok's answer: "I have so much on my plate.")

1727
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:25,890
- You're out of your mind. - You should get it together.

1728
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:28,760
- What? Xi A. - He has a lot on his plate.

1729
01:02:28,768 --> 01:02:30,770
You keep making me say it.

1730
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,470
Hey, she doesn't want to get her face dirty.

1731
01:02:33,473 --> 01:02:36,825
Answer. I'll go. Let me see this first.

1732
01:02:38,644 --> 01:02:41,365
- Are your eyes open or closed? - His eyes are open.

1733
01:02:41,914 --> 01:02:43,295
Me.

1734
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,750
"I'm too busy at work."

1735
01:02:45,752 --> 01:02:47,320
(Seok Jin's answer: "I'm too busy at work.")

1736
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,720
- "I'm too busy at work." - That's the same thing.

1737
01:02:49,722 --> 01:02:51,950
- You said it's similar. - Why did he say that?

1738
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:53,390
- You said it's similar. - Come here.

1739
01:02:53,393 --> 01:02:55,090
He needs to get a stronger penalty.

1740
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:56,320
(He's an interesting guy.)

1741
01:02:56,329 --> 01:02:58,260
(He gets a makeover.)

1742
01:02:58,264 --> 01:03:01,030
- What's this? - This finally looks complete.

1743
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,200
- Isn't it great? - Yes.

1744
01:03:02,201 --> 01:03:03,700
This is driving me nuts.

1745
01:03:03,703 --> 01:03:04,970
(Toothless and homeless king, Big Nose)

1746
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:07,695
- "I have a dinner meeting." - "I have somewhere to be."

1747
01:03:07,974 --> 01:03:09,340
"I have somewhere to be."

1748
01:03:09,342 --> 01:03:11,610
(She says an answer fast.)

1749
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:12,610
This is it.

1750
01:03:12,612 --> 01:03:14,280
(Correct)

1751
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,840
(Yes, I got it.)

1752
01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:18,680
- I'm excited. - You can say it differently.

1753
01:03:18,684 --> 01:03:19,710
(Couple Survey is over.)

1754
01:03:19,719 --> 01:03:20,950
Xi A is good.

1755
01:03:20,953 --> 01:03:23,220
(Seung Ri and So Min won 13 dollars.)

1756
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:24,675
I almost had it.

1757
01:03:25,124 --> 01:03:28,060
All right. Let's start.

1758
01:03:28,061 --> 01:03:29,990
"Seduction". 1, 2, 3.

1759
01:03:29,996 --> 01:03:32,485
(Word: "seduction")

1760
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:35,600
(I'm seducing you.)

1761
01:03:35,601 --> 01:03:37,925
(Nice, we matched.)

1762
01:03:38,638 --> 01:03:40,570
We're wrong.

1763
01:03:40,573 --> 01:03:41,740
- Are we wrong? - We're wrong.

1764
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:44,510
- Haha, how's that seduction? - What?

1765
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,270
- How's that seduction? - Try it.

1766
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:47,610
- That doesn't make any sense. - Do it.

1767
01:03:47,613 --> 01:03:49,780
What's wrong? What's wrong with her?

1768
01:03:49,782 --> 01:03:52,110
- Sun Mi failed. - I'm sorry.

1769
01:03:52,118 --> 01:03:54,680
Try it. Don't get seduced.

1770
01:03:54,687 --> 01:03:56,380
- Try it. 1, 2, 3. - What's that?

1771
01:03:56,389 --> 01:03:57,990
(Tapping)

1772
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:59,445
1, 2, 3.

1773
01:03:59,492 --> 01:04:01,345
- Okay. - Do you approve?

1774
01:04:01,494 --> 01:04:03,445
I approve.

1775
01:04:03,663 --> 01:04:05,615
That's seduction.

1776
01:04:06,232 --> 01:04:08,100
I approve.

1777
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:10,055
I approve of it.

1778
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:14,470
(They each have 1 board left.)

1779
01:04:14,474 --> 01:04:15,925
This is fun.

1780
01:04:16,075 --> 01:04:18,470
"Cheerleader". 1, 2, 3.

1781
01:04:18,478 --> 01:04:20,680
(Decisive word: "cheerleader")

1782
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,365
(Se Chan and B.I match. Haha and Sun Mi match.)

1783
01:04:24,784 --> 01:04:26,410
(Ji Hyo and Bobby match as well.)

1784
01:04:26,419 --> 01:04:29,220
(However...)

1785
01:04:29,222 --> 01:04:30,380
This is not right.

1786
01:04:30,389 --> 01:04:32,990
Jong Kook and Ju Yeon are out.

1787
01:04:32,992 --> 01:04:34,745
(Their hands don't match.)

1788
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,760
Are you sure about that?

1789
01:04:36,762 --> 01:04:38,930
Sun Mi, are you sure that's cheerleading?

1790
01:04:38,931 --> 01:04:40,390
- Show them. - How?

1791
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:43,200
You're making us mad. Isn't this cheerleading?

1792
01:04:43,202 --> 01:04:45,055
It is.

1793
01:04:45,371 --> 01:04:48,155
- She's a cheerleader. - You're absolutely right.

1794
01:04:48,241 --> 01:04:49,640
She is a cheerleader.

1795
01:04:49,642 --> 01:04:50,840
(Only Jong Kook and Ju Yeon are out.)

1796
01:04:50,843 --> 01:04:52,770
"iKON". 1, 2, 3.

1797
01:04:52,778 --> 01:04:54,365
(Next word: "iKON")

1798
01:04:54,914 --> 01:04:56,410
(Like this?)

1799
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:57,805
2, 3.

1800
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,510
They're wrong.

1801
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:01,120
He covered his mouth, and he covered his chin.

1802
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,980
- My mouth is protruding. - You're wrong.

1803
01:05:02,989 --> 01:05:04,790
No, my mouth is protruding. Jong Kook.

1804
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:06,590
- You're wrong. - Jong Kook, my mouth is protruding.

1805
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,260
They're wrong, and they're wrong as well.

1806
01:05:09,262 --> 01:05:11,930
- No. - Haha and Sun Mi win.

1807
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:13,190
All right.

1808
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:15,960
We'll decide 2nd and 3rd place teams.

1809
01:05:15,968 --> 01:05:17,415
(2nd and 3rd place teams will be decided.)

1810
01:05:18,437 --> 01:05:19,870
(Only 1st and 2nd teams can get free meals.)

1811
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:22,340
You have to do something that requires little space.

1812
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:24,465
Hold on. Isn't this smaller?

1813
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:27,110
We have to cross our legs.

1814
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:28,410
- Like this. - You have to be quick.

1815
01:05:28,414 --> 01:05:31,280
- Haha recommended this. - I recommended it.

1816
01:05:31,284 --> 01:05:32,450
Ready.

1817
01:05:32,451 --> 01:05:33,810
(The word is...)

1818
01:05:33,819 --> 01:05:35,220
"Acting cute in Eastern Europe".

1819
01:05:35,221 --> 01:05:39,345
(Phrase: "acting cute in Eastern Europe")

1820
01:05:40,226 --> 01:05:43,420
(5 minutes ago when the word was "acting cute")

1821
01:05:43,429 --> 01:05:46,445
(Team Yellow insisted this was "acting cute in Northern Europe".)

1822
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,425
(It's "acting cute in Eastern Europe" this time.)

1823
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,840
(Good)

1824
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,855
This was Northern Europe earlier.

1825
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:59,070
This was Northern Europe.

1826
01:05:59,078 --> 01:06:00,680
Wasn't it?

1827
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,680
Look.

1828
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:03,195
(Is it Northern or Eastern?)

1829
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:06,350
Northern and Eastern Europe can't be the same.

1830
01:06:06,352 --> 01:06:08,320
Time out.

1831
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:10,075
We're right.

1832
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:12,050
- Northern Europe? - Europe is one.

1833
01:06:12,058 --> 01:06:14,320
(He's shameless all the way.)

1834
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:18,115
(Ji Hyo and Bobby win at the end.)

1835
01:06:18,764 --> 01:06:23,915
(Debt Amounts)

1836
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,930
(Final location: gymnasium)

1837
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:28,425
They made...

1838
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:30,965
- a curling rink. - All right.

1839
01:06:31,244 --> 01:06:32,410
(It's much bigger than the previous one.)

1840
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:34,695
I love this game.

1841
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:36,780
This is really nice.

1842
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:39,235
I hope I get a good one.

1843
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:41,805
- Let's get an exemption. - This won't be easy.

1844
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,320
There's "exemption".

1845
01:06:43,322 --> 01:06:45,345
(The rubber basins are curling stones, and there are targets.)

1846
01:06:45,825 --> 01:06:46,990
(What is the last mission for writing off debt?)

1847
01:06:46,993 --> 01:06:48,590
This is the final race.

1848
01:06:48,594 --> 01:06:50,930
(What is the last mission for writing off debt?)

1849
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,330
Goodness.

1850
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:53,790
How much debt do we have?

1851
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:56,100
(Current debt status after lunch)

1852
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:57,555
(Current debt status)

1853
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:59,570
(We're in last place.)

1854
01:06:59,572 --> 01:07:01,840
By the way,

1855
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:03,340
I thought Seung Ri...

1856
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:04,610
was Soo Yong.

1857
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:07,125
- Why do you have dark circles? - They keep getting worse.

1858
01:07:07,913 --> 01:07:09,280
- He's completely... - It's really bad.

1859
01:07:09,282 --> 01:07:10,680
- Well... - "It's really bad."

1860
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:11,780
That was too blunt.

1861
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:14,280
Let's wrap this up. He has to get some IV fluid.

1862
01:07:14,287 --> 01:07:16,980
You should eat some salmon. You have a lot of money.

1863
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:18,290
Don't you think I tried?

1864
01:07:18,291 --> 01:07:19,590
(Goodness)

1865
01:07:19,592 --> 01:07:20,960
(Seung Ri finally explodes.)

1866
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:22,660
- Don't you think I tried? - You have?

1867
01:07:22,662 --> 01:07:24,330
Did you get a health award?

1868
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,830
(I care about you.)

1869
01:07:25,831 --> 01:07:27,545
I'm just worried.

1870
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:30,260
He ignored it the whole time, and he exploded at the end.

1871
01:07:30,269 --> 01:07:32,200
- He's mad. - You should understand.

1872
01:07:32,204 --> 01:07:33,825
Here's the final mission.

1873
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:35,440
It's Human Curling.

1874
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,765
- Okay. - It's curling.

1875
01:07:38,844 --> 01:07:40,570
There are two rounds in total.

1876
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:42,940
Two pairs become a team,

1877
01:07:42,948 --> 01:07:45,910
and you earn the amount...

1878
01:07:45,918 --> 01:07:47,720
- that the basin stops on. - I see.

1879
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,480
Two pairs become a team,

1880
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:51,490
and you split the total amount.

1881
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:53,145
(If you can't write off your debt, you get a penalty at the end.)

1882
01:07:54,093 --> 01:07:57,020
1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 are the teams.

1883
01:07:57,029 --> 01:07:58,530
We have to pair up with those with little debt.

1884
01:07:58,531 --> 01:07:59,885
(They're in last place with 75 dollars of debt.)

1885
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:03,160
- Kwang Soo is worst. - He has too much debt.

1886
01:08:03,169 --> 01:08:05,285
Please pick one.

1887
01:08:05,705 --> 01:08:08,140
I just hope I don't get Kwang Soo.

1888
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:09,440
I hope I don't get him.

1889
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:10,755
All right.

1890
01:08:11,243 --> 01:08:13,570
Please.

1891
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:15,410
- That's good. - You're not showing me?

1892
01:08:15,414 --> 01:08:16,910
Xi A. I won't show you.

1893
01:08:16,916 --> 01:08:18,350
Go first, Seung Ri.

1894
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:20,450
So Min and I picked...

1895
01:08:20,453 --> 01:08:21,720
four.

1896
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:23,050
- Four. - What?

1897
01:08:23,055 --> 01:08:24,820
Then...

1898
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:28,075
(Haha and Sun Mi have 3.)

1899
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,020
- How much do you have? - This is good.

1900
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:31,530
- How much do you have? - 15 dollars.

1901
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:33,530
(They might win 1st and 2nd places today.)

1902
01:08:33,532 --> 01:08:34,600
For real?

1903
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:37,670
(They're watching this celebration.)

1904
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:39,870
They'll have so much money.

1905
01:08:39,872 --> 01:08:42,700
(1st and 2nd places are together, so what are we supposed to do?)

1906
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:44,840
- No way. - 12 dollars.

1907
01:08:44,844 --> 01:08:46,340
The rich get richer, and the poor get poorer.

1908
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:48,080
(They're jealous. This is dirty.)

1909
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,510
You can't do anything about it.

1910
01:08:49,515 --> 01:08:51,180
- Next. - Us.

1911
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:52,380
B.I?

1912
01:08:52,385 --> 01:08:54,220
- We have 8. - Who's 7?

1913
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,480
Seven.

1914
01:08:55,488 --> 01:08:56,680
What a relief.

1915
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:58,490
(Jong Kook and Ju Yeon are in 3rd place.)

1916
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:01,215
- How much debt do you have? - We have little.

1917
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:02,960
We have the same.

1918
01:09:02,962 --> 01:09:04,020
- How much do you have? - 27 dollars?

1919
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:05,590
- 24 dollars. - That's not bad.

1920
01:09:05,598 --> 01:09:07,900
- We're in the middle. - We're good.

1921
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,300
(The ants watch the merger and acquisitions of the riches.)

1922
01:09:11,303 --> 01:09:13,170
Why didn't Kwang Soo go yet?

1923
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:15,440
(Why can't we be one of them?)

1924
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:16,770
This is driving me nuts.

1925
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:18,040
- I'm so anxious. - We have 35 dollars.

1926
01:09:18,043 --> 01:09:20,270
He should be over there.

1927
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:21,580
- He didn't go yet. - Why...

1928
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:22,880
We're always left behind.

1929
01:09:22,882 --> 01:09:25,680
What number is Kwang Soo? Let's see his number first.

1930
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,550
1, 2, 3. This is Kwang Soo.

1931
01:09:27,553 --> 01:09:29,980
- We're 2. - They're with 1.

1932
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:32,550
- It's 1. - In 1...

1933
01:09:32,558 --> 01:09:33,750
We didn't see ours, right?

1934
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,475
(It's not us.)

1935
01:09:37,696 --> 01:09:39,030
Does nobody have number one?

1936
01:09:39,031 --> 01:09:41,200
- I think it's them. - Why are you hiding it? Who is it?

1937
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,800
- I think it's them. - Who is it?

1938
01:09:42,802 --> 01:09:44,270
- I think it's them. - Who has number one?

1939
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,300
Who is it?

1940
01:09:45,304 --> 01:09:46,570
(We have...)

1941
01:09:46,572 --> 01:09:50,000
(number 1.)

1942
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:52,710
(Losers meet losers. They're in extreme poverty.)

1943
01:09:52,711 --> 01:09:55,810
(They have 40 dollars and 75 dollars of debt.)

1944
01:09:55,815 --> 01:09:59,050
(We dodged the bomb.)

1945
01:09:59,051 --> 01:10:00,310
- We did it. - I'm relieved.

1946
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:01,920
- We just need... - We have to get "exemption".

1947
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:03,120
We just need "exemption".

1948
01:10:03,122 --> 01:10:04,990
That's the only way. Go for it.

1949
01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:06,650
We have over 100 dollars of debt.

1950
01:10:06,659 --> 01:10:08,390
- Let's do it. - "Exemption".

1951
01:10:08,394 --> 01:10:10,815
- We need it. - We have no other way.

1952
01:10:11,564 --> 01:10:15,500
(Pairs and Teams)

1953
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:17,670
- The order is important. - It is.

1954
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,100
If you go later, you can push the team that was there before.

1955
01:10:21,106 --> 01:10:23,695
So let's decide the order...

1956
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,510
with Race of Wits.

1957
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:27,580
(Let's decide with Race of Wits.)

1958
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,535
- Stop playing that game! - Let's do that.

1959
01:10:29,582 --> 01:10:30,980
- Come here. - Why does he...

1960
01:10:30,983 --> 01:10:33,410
love this game so much all of a sudden?

1961
01:10:33,419 --> 01:10:34,620
Why all of a sudden?

1962
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,420
How many times do we play this a day?

1963
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:37,850
He's a late bloomer.

1964
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,790
Why do you like it so much?

1965
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:41,460
- It's Race of Wits. - Do you have no wits at all?

1966
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,020
What is it?

1967
01:10:43,028 --> 01:10:45,630
(The losers have to throw the stone first.)

1968
01:10:45,631 --> 01:10:47,090
Let's get started.

1969
01:10:47,099 --> 01:10:49,655
Set, go.

1970
01:10:49,802 --> 01:10:50,800
One.

1971
01:10:50,803 --> 01:10:53,155
(Sitting)

1972
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:54,640
- What are you doing? - It's separate.

1973
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,700
- They're out. - You have to play.

1974
01:10:56,709 --> 01:10:57,840
You have to say, "two".

1975
01:10:57,843 --> 01:10:59,210
- I sat down. - You have to say it.

1976
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:00,880
- I sat down. - Seung Ri.

1977
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,140
- You have to say, "two". - You do.

1978
01:11:02,147 --> 01:11:04,080
- It's separate. - I have to say, "two"?

1979
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:06,010
He was so cute when he sat down.

1980
01:11:06,018 --> 01:11:07,110
(Seung Ri is so cute.)

1981
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:08,520
Do I have to say, "two"?

1982
01:11:08,521 --> 01:11:10,350
We're separate.

1983
01:11:10,356 --> 01:11:11,920
- We play on our own? I didn't know. - He did this.

1984
01:11:11,924 --> 01:11:13,050
So Min said, "one",

1985
01:11:13,058 --> 01:11:14,590
and he was so happy. He sat down.

1986
01:11:14,593 --> 01:11:16,415
(He was so happy, and he sat down as well.)

1987
01:11:16,595 --> 01:11:18,585
(Let's check.)

1988
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:22,085
(Yes, I'm saved.)

1989
01:11:22,434 --> 01:11:24,500
- I didn't know. - It's over.

1990
01:11:24,503 --> 01:11:25,770
- I had no idea. - I'm sorry.

1991
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:27,130
- Seung Ri. - I didn't know.

1992
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:29,270
- It's over. - We're sorry.

1993
01:11:29,275 --> 01:11:31,510
- You're supposed to tell me. - Take a break.

1994
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,180
(Seung Ri is not witty, so they get to go 1st.)

1995
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:36,665
Here's the next round.

1996
01:11:36,882 --> 01:11:39,235
- Set, go. - Set.

1997
01:11:39,752 --> 01:11:41,480
One.

1998
01:11:41,487 --> 01:11:44,075
(B.I gets 1.)

1999
01:11:44,423 --> 01:11:45,945
- 2. - 3.

2000
01:11:46,492 --> 01:11:48,390
(We're witty, right?)

2001
01:11:48,394 --> 01:11:50,045
- 4. - 5.

2002
01:11:50,429 --> 01:11:52,385
(Team Green is safe.)

2003
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:54,345
- 6. - 7.

2004
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:56,730
- 8. - 9.

2005
01:11:56,735 --> 01:11:57,970
10.

2006
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:59,425
11.

2007
01:12:00,839 --> 01:12:02,700
(Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Seok Jin)

2008
01:12:02,708 --> 01:12:05,270
(The game is almost over. How will this 3-way race end?)

2009
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:06,610
- 12. - 13.

2010
01:12:06,612 --> 01:12:08,035
14.

2011
01:12:09,381 --> 01:12:12,550
(He was looking around, and he was too late.)

2012
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:14,920
(When you think it's late, it's late no matter how quick you are.)

2013
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,420
- Did you see him? - I didn't expect that.

2014
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:19,290
- Did you see his face at the end? - I didn't know.

2015
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,290
I thought they were playing.

2016
01:12:21,293 --> 01:12:22,460
Go ahead.

2017
01:12:22,461 --> 01:12:24,190
Gosh, Jong Kook.

2018
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:26,745
That was the fastest "14" I've ever heard in my life.

2019
01:12:27,099 --> 01:12:28,730
It's fun to play with so many people.

2020
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,600
- It is. - Right?

2021
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:32,100
- We didn't say it together. - Right?

2022
01:12:32,104 --> 01:12:33,430
Goodness.

2023
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,195
(They're 1st and 2nd places for having no wits.)

2024
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:37,200
Let's start sitting this time.

2025
01:12:37,209 --> 01:12:38,565
(Round 3 starts sitting down.)

2026
01:12:38,844 --> 01:12:41,980
(Bobby and Ji Hyo, and Sun Mi and Haha lose.)

2027
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:43,080
- 1. - 2.

2028
01:12:43,082 --> 01:12:47,105
(B.I and Se Chan, and Jae Seok and Xi A lose.)

2029
01:12:48,053 --> 01:12:50,920
We did it. We're going last.

2030
01:12:50,923 --> 01:12:55,445
(Curling Order)

2031
01:12:55,961 --> 01:12:58,060
- Ready. - Go back a bit.

2032
01:12:58,063 --> 01:13:00,330
Try going back and forth.

2033
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:01,630
Okay.

2034
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:02,930
Straighten out the wheels.

2035
01:13:02,935 --> 01:13:04,355
- Two. - This is so funny.

2036
01:13:08,474 --> 01:13:09,970
- It's too strong. - It's good.

2037
01:13:09,975 --> 01:13:11,410
- It's strong. - No, it's good.

2038
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:12,610
It's strong.

2039
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:14,140
(He approaches the center.)

2040
01:13:14,146 --> 01:13:15,580
It's good.

2041
01:13:15,581 --> 01:13:16,780
It is.

2042
01:13:16,782 --> 01:13:18,365
It's the right direction.

2043
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:23,020
(Will he get "exemption"?)

2044
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:24,890
He's passing it.

2045
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:26,150
(He goes outside of the target.)

2046
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:27,250
It's out.

2047
01:13:27,259 --> 01:13:28,615
(Play again next time.)

2048
01:13:29,762 --> 01:13:33,230
(They're too strong. It's an out-of-the-park homer.)

2049
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:35,300
- It's out. - This is great.

2050
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:37,015
This is great.

2051
01:13:37,569 --> 01:13:39,400
- This is... - It's difficult.

2052
01:13:39,405 --> 01:13:41,540
(He's by himself.)

2053
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:44,140
If you're going first, you have to be near the target.

2054
01:13:44,143 --> 01:13:45,795
That wasn't bad.

2055
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,340
- We have to block the path. - Okay.

2056
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:53,180
(Let's block the path so that other people can't be in target.)

2057
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:54,750
Let's block it. We'll be good.

2058
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:56,320
- Let's go. - Hold on.

2059
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:57,580
- Point left. - Second team.

2060
01:13:57,589 --> 01:13:58,790
- Point left? - No.

2061
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:00,750
- No, this way. - This way?

2062
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:02,945
- If you block the path... - Yes.

2063
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:05,430
The direction...

2064
01:14:05,431 --> 01:14:06,845
It's not strong enough.

2065
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:10,500
(It's gentle and accurate like a curling stone on the ice rink.)

2066
01:14:10,502 --> 01:14:11,800
He's there.

2067
01:14:11,804 --> 01:14:17,340
(The direction looks right. Will his plan work?)

2068
01:14:17,342 --> 01:14:19,365
Let's block the path.

2069
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:21,680
(He keeps on going.)

2070
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,880
How much is it?

2071
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:26,980
- It's 0 dollars. - 0 dollars.

2072
01:14:26,985 --> 01:14:29,520
(Nice play)

2073
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,875
- Is it zero? - It's okay.

2074
01:14:32,191 --> 01:14:33,390
People might bump into us.

2075
01:14:33,392 --> 01:14:35,560
(They get nothing exempt.)

2076
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:37,120
Number three is Haha and Sun Mi.

2077
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:38,190
Let's go.

2078
01:14:38,197 --> 01:14:39,730
(They have 32 dollars of debt.)

2079
01:14:39,732 --> 01:14:42,555
(Here's our team's strategy.)

2080
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,930
(They saw So Min and Seung Ri going out.)

2081
01:14:44,937 --> 01:14:47,100
I think it's better...

2082
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:49,340
to aim for the front even if it's a bad spot.

2083
01:14:49,341 --> 01:14:50,795
(They're going to hit lightly.)

2084
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:54,170
(Push lightly, Sun Mi.)

2085
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:55,510
- It's good. - It's strong.

2086
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:56,780
He's going left.

2087
01:14:56,782 --> 01:14:59,250
(Where are you going?)

2088
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:00,910
He's going left.

2089
01:15:00,919 --> 01:15:02,505
- It's strong. - You can't!

2090
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:04,380
(No,)

2091
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:06,745
(you can't. Turn.)

2092
01:15:07,593 --> 01:15:09,960
- He's gone. - Haha.

2093
01:15:09,962 --> 01:15:12,330
(She jumps up and down after doing a groove.)

2094
01:15:12,331 --> 01:15:13,785
I'm sorry.

2095
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:16,560
(You promised we'd pay off the debt, but you're leaving.)

2096
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:18,170
- It's okay. - That was good.

2097
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:19,170
They're out.

2098
01:15:19,171 --> 01:15:22,170
(They get nothing exempt.)

2099
01:15:22,174 --> 01:15:24,000
They all got zero dollars.

2100
01:15:24,009 --> 01:15:25,565
(None of them got anything exempt yet.)

2101
01:15:26,211 --> 01:15:28,010
Ji Hyo is good at games like this.

2102
01:15:28,013 --> 01:15:29,540
(It's Ji Hyo and Bobby's turn.)

2103
01:15:29,548 --> 01:15:31,080
She's good.

2104
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,105
(It's a soft delivery.)

2105
01:15:33,318 --> 01:15:34,550
That's not it.

2106
01:15:34,553 --> 01:15:38,490
(He's going towards the middle.)

2107
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,750
This is not a defending tactic.

2108
01:15:39,758 --> 01:15:41,745
(All right. Keep going.)

2109
01:15:41,894 --> 01:15:46,185
(He's going to the middle. Where will he stop?)

2110
01:15:46,331 --> 01:15:48,130
- 30 dollars? 10 dollars. - 30 dollars.

2111
01:15:48,133 --> 01:15:49,730
(He lands on "20 dollars".)

2112
01:15:49,735 --> 01:15:51,485
- Ji Hyo, that's not bad. - 20 dollars?

2113
01:15:51,937 --> 01:15:53,630
- Ji Hyo, that's not bad. - 20 dollars?

2114
01:15:53,639 --> 01:15:55,155
That's good.

2115
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,500
- 20 dollars. - Is it 20 dollars?

2116
01:15:57,509 --> 01:16:00,425
- 20 dollars. - I should have gotten 50 dollars.

2117
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:03,580
Se Chan and B.I are up next.

2118
01:16:03,582 --> 01:16:04,950
Okay, let's go.

2119
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,050
You have to put me...

2120
01:16:06,051 --> 01:16:08,050
between Jong Kook and Bobby.

2121
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:09,380
That would be the best.

2122
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:12,550
You should come here and block the path.

2123
01:16:12,558 --> 01:16:13,720
Put me between them.

2124
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:15,115
Come in through here.

2125
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:17,115
Do well.

2126
01:16:17,196 --> 01:16:18,545
Watch the wheels.

2127
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:19,830
He might get blocked.

2128
01:16:19,832 --> 01:16:21,090
It's not half bad.

2129
01:16:21,099 --> 01:16:22,730
- Let's go. - No, no.

2130
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:24,360
Take out Bobby.

2131
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:25,670
Let's go.

2132
01:16:25,671 --> 01:16:26,970
That's good.

2133
01:16:26,972 --> 01:16:29,025
(I have a good feeling about this.)

2134
01:16:29,942 --> 01:16:31,665
Come in through here.

2135
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:34,365
Come on!

2136
01:16:34,513 --> 01:16:36,840
It's okay. Use your body.

2137
01:16:36,849 --> 01:16:38,310
My goodness.

2138
01:16:38,317 --> 01:16:39,680
(He stops.)

2139
01:16:39,685 --> 01:16:41,050
You should have used your body.

2140
01:16:41,053 --> 01:16:42,720
It's okay.

2141
01:16:42,721 --> 01:16:43,920
It's a good defense.

2142
01:16:43,922 --> 01:16:46,005
How are we supposed to play?

2143
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:48,460
- You blocked the path well. - You did a good job, B.I.

2144
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,085
(They come up with the perfect defensive strategy.)

2145
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:57,400
In which direction should I push?

2146
01:16:57,402 --> 01:16:59,525
Push straight.

2147
01:17:00,472 --> 01:17:02,140
(Let's walk the straight and narrow path...)

2148
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,200
(and get an exemption.)

2149
01:17:03,208 --> 01:17:07,070
We shouldn't push Se Chan.

2150
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:09,080
Give Se Chan a push...

2151
01:17:09,081 --> 01:17:10,810
so that he can stop on 20 dollars.

2152
01:17:10,816 --> 01:17:13,005
(Let's avoid Se Chan and pay off 41 dollars at once.)

2153
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:17,435
(She pushes him hard.)

2154
01:17:18,056 --> 01:17:19,450
(Jae Seok moves straight.)

2155
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:24,115
(Let's see if he can pass through as he planned.)

2156
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:27,145
(Bumping)

2157
01:17:28,634 --> 01:17:31,470
30 dollars!

2158
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:33,525
(Jong Kook lands on 30 dollars.)

2159
01:17:33,839 --> 01:17:38,395
(He gets 30 dollars from the accident.)

2160
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:41,835
(Gosh, thank you.)

2161
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:44,540
(They get 30 dollars unexpectedly.)

2162
01:17:44,549 --> 01:17:47,010
I hope no one bumps into me now.

2163
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:49,420
(Jae Seok gets 10 dollars off and Jong Kook gets 30 dollars off.)

2164
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:50,420
We can't push all three of them.

2165
01:17:50,422 --> 01:17:52,890
There is nothing I can do because of Se Chan.

2166
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:54,050
- You can go that way. - Gosh,

2167
01:17:54,059 --> 01:17:55,615
why is he over there?

2168
01:17:56,728 --> 01:17:58,890
If it weren't for Se Chan, we could have gone in between them.

2169
01:17:58,897 --> 01:18:00,790
- That's right. - I am a player, too.

2170
01:18:00,799 --> 01:18:02,000
(This is my strategy.)

2171
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,360
- If it weren't for him, - You should push him away.

2172
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:05,725
things would have been perfect.

2173
01:18:06,038 --> 01:18:07,530
They keep complaining about me.

2174
01:18:07,539 --> 01:18:09,325
(Try to penetrate if you can.)

2175
01:18:10,909 --> 01:18:12,270
Se Chan is like that.

2176
01:18:12,277 --> 01:18:14,525
Let's push Se Chan...

2177
01:18:14,579 --> 01:18:17,180
so that he can push Bobby and Jae Seok.

2178
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:18,250
Right?

2179
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,105
This should be the angle.

2180
01:18:20,852 --> 01:18:22,380
- Okay. - Let's get Jae Seok.

2181
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:23,520
- Let's go. - Here we go.

2182
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:24,850
You can do it.

2183
01:18:24,856 --> 01:18:27,805
(Their plan is to turn the obstacle into a tool of victory.)

2184
01:18:27,893 --> 01:18:29,315
Push hard.

2185
01:18:29,761 --> 01:18:32,060
That's good. That's good.

2186
01:18:32,064 --> 01:18:33,990
(Seok Jin glides at the speed of light.)

2187
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:38,655
(Let's see if his strategy comes to life.)

2188
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:41,030
That's good. That's good.

2189
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:42,100
Good job.

2190
01:18:42,107 --> 01:18:43,540
(He falls before he reaches the exemption.)

2191
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:47,270
(He pushes the others away but fails to stop at the exemption.)

2192
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:49,080
- What is this? - My goodness.

2193
01:18:49,081 --> 01:18:50,595
- You're out. - Seok Jin.

2194
01:18:51,049 --> 01:18:53,510
It doesn't count if you fall down, does it?

2195
01:18:53,518 --> 01:18:55,650
- Let's get him up. - Get him up where he is.

2196
01:18:55,654 --> 01:18:59,950
- Do that. - Get him up where he is.

2197
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,050
Don't move him.

2198
01:19:01,059 --> 01:19:02,220
- How much did he get? - Zero dollars.

2199
01:19:02,227 --> 01:19:04,020
- No, it's 30 dollars. - It's 0 dollars.

2200
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:06,685
(He goes from exemption to 0 dollars.)

2201
01:19:07,299 --> 01:19:08,300
Let's go.

2202
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,560
We need to hit Seok Jin.

2203
01:19:09,568 --> 01:19:11,470
Hit Seok Jin's right side.

2204
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:13,900
That way, both you and he will live.

2205
01:19:13,905 --> 01:19:15,825
(Ji Min wants to put Seok Jin on the exemption.)

2206
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:18,270
(Kwang Soo's sacrifice can save Team Blue.)

2207
01:19:18,276 --> 01:19:20,665
1, 2.

2208
01:19:21,179 --> 01:19:22,540
- That's too... - No.

2209
01:19:22,547 --> 01:19:24,335
(Throw towards Seok Jin.)

2210
01:19:24,483 --> 01:19:25,750
What is this?

2211
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:28,065
- Let's go. - That's good.

2212
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:32,145
(Kwang Soo heads towards Bobby, not Seok Jin.)

2213
01:19:32,524 --> 01:19:33,550
(Bumping)

2214
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:36,375
- It's "exemption"! - It is!

2215
01:19:37,229 --> 01:19:41,145
(Bobby gets the exemption.)

2216
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:46,585
(Kwang Soo ends up giving Bobby the exemption.)

2217
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:48,440
It is!

2218
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,825
(This isn't what I had in mind.)

2219
01:19:52,477 --> 01:19:53,710
Kwang Soo!

2220
01:19:53,712 --> 01:19:55,840
(Kwang Soo, thank you for the exemption.)

2221
01:19:55,847 --> 01:19:57,080
- My goodness. - Kwang Soo.

2222
01:19:57,082 --> 01:19:58,250
You got the exemption.

2223
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:00,650
- I'm so happy. - You got the exemption.

2224
01:20:00,652 --> 01:20:02,650
(They help the other team and get 0 dollars.)

2225
01:20:02,654 --> 01:20:03,880
That's good.

2226
01:20:03,889 --> 01:20:04,920
I love it.

2227
01:20:04,923 --> 01:20:06,150
Kwang Soo.

2228
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:07,590
Thank you.

2229
01:20:07,592 --> 01:20:09,915
- That was amazing. - I am so annoyed.

2230
01:20:10,028 --> 01:20:11,760
- I am so annoyed. - That was amazing.

2231
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:13,330
(Ji Hyo's team gets an exemption,)

2232
01:20:13,331 --> 01:20:14,930
(and Jong Kook's gets 30 dollars off.)

2233
01:20:14,933 --> 01:20:16,500
(Bobby and Ji Hyo and Jae Seok and Xi A get an exemption.)

2234
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:18,430
(Se Chan and B.I and Jong Kook and Ju Yeon get 30 dollars off.)

2235
01:20:18,437 --> 01:20:20,955
(The rest get 0 dollars off.)

2236
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:22,840
This game makes me root for the others.

2237
01:20:22,841 --> 01:20:24,500
(The 2nd round of Human Curling starts.)

2238
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:25,710
That's good.

2239
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,670
- So Min, lean to the left. - That's good.

2240
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:29,480
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars.

2241
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:31,235
10 dollars.

2242
01:20:32,017 --> 01:20:34,710
(Jong Kook and Ju Yeon have 23 dollars of debt.)

2243
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,935
- Okay. - That's good.

2244
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:39,905
- That's good. - It was a nice landing.

2245
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:42,045
Good job, Ju Yeon.

2246
01:20:43,095 --> 01:20:44,420
This is good for us.

2247
01:20:44,429 --> 01:20:46,745
Why is she going that way?

2248
01:20:47,132 --> 01:20:49,300
(She is outside the target area.)

2249
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:50,960
Gosh, why didn't it go that way?

2250
01:20:50,969 --> 01:20:52,230
Come on, Haha.

2251
01:20:52,237 --> 01:20:54,330
- Haha. - I feel bad for Sun Mi.

2252
01:20:54,339 --> 01:20:55,640
I know how you feel.

2253
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,655
I am sorry.

2254
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:58,840
It was incredible.

2255
01:20:58,844 --> 01:21:00,110
It's like that.

2256
01:21:00,112 --> 01:21:01,070
In which direction should I push?

2257
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:03,340
They would be in the Human Curling national team.

2258
01:21:03,348 --> 01:21:04,810
- Seriously. - I think I should push...

2259
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:05,950
- in this direction. - I agree.

2260
01:21:05,951 --> 01:21:07,410
They are like professional athletes.

2261
01:21:07,419 --> 01:21:08,880
- Can you do it? - Of course.

2262
01:21:08,887 --> 01:21:11,080
(They get ready for the throw.)

2263
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:14,805
- This is the last moment. - Hold on.

2264
01:21:15,293 --> 01:21:17,720
There she goes.

2265
01:21:17,729 --> 01:21:18,960
Look at that.

2266
01:21:18,964 --> 01:21:20,890
(She moves towards the center like the master of Human Curling.)

2267
01:21:20,899 --> 01:21:23,485
- They are good. - They are good.

2268
01:21:23,735 --> 01:21:25,170
- She is in the target area. - Okay.

2269
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:27,425
(Ji Hyo controls the direction before she stops.)

2270
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:28,940
Don't move more.

2271
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:31,270
(She lands on 30 dollars.)

2272
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:32,640
30 dollars?

2273
01:21:32,644 --> 01:21:34,070
- 30 dollars? - They are incredible.

2274
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:35,535
30 dollars.

2275
01:21:36,848 --> 01:21:38,810
You should go between Ju Yeon and Ji Hyo.

2276
01:21:38,817 --> 01:21:42,605
(Aim for the exemption between Ju Yeon and Ji Hyo.)

2277
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:43,720
Okay.

2278
01:21:43,722 --> 01:21:45,090
(You simply need to go straight.)

2279
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:47,090
It will be okay, Se Chan.

2280
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:48,090
My goodness.

2281
01:21:48,093 --> 01:21:49,760
- Good job. - Ju Yeon, go back.

2282
01:21:49,761 --> 01:21:51,315
Ju Yeon, go back.

2283
01:21:52,597 --> 01:21:54,930
That's right. Don't move.

2284
01:21:54,933 --> 01:21:56,815
(Ju Yeon gets pushed towards the exemption.)

2285
01:21:57,135 --> 01:22:00,385
(If she stops, Team Black gets the exemption.)

2286
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:05,665
(That's right, Ju Yeon. Stop right there.)

2287
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:07,810
That's right. Don't move.

2288
01:22:07,812 --> 01:22:09,080
(Sliding)

2289
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,380
That was too strong.

2290
01:22:10,382 --> 01:22:12,550
- 30 dollars. Don't move. - That's good.

2291
01:22:12,551 --> 01:22:13,550
Don't move.

2292
01:22:13,552 --> 01:22:14,750
30 dollars.

2293
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:16,580
(She lands on 30 dollars.)

2294
01:22:16,588 --> 01:22:18,080
- Did I land on 30 dollars? - That's good.

2295
01:22:18,089 --> 01:22:19,090
- Don't move. - 30 dollars?

2296
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:21,915
(B.I is exhilarated.)

2297
01:22:22,294 --> 01:22:25,260
(The coaching staff gives him a thumbs up.)

2298
01:22:25,263 --> 01:22:26,730
Don't move.

2299
01:22:26,731 --> 01:22:27,930
(It looks like we did it.)

2300
01:22:27,933 --> 01:22:29,960
- We did it. - Don't move.

2301
01:22:29,968 --> 01:22:33,655
(Ju Yeon and B.I get 35 dollars off for Team Black.)

2302
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,040
She is moving to the left.

2303
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:37,540
- She will hit B.I. - No.

2304
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:38,840
- B.I. - Xi A.

2305
01:22:38,843 --> 01:22:40,140
She will hit our team members.

2306
01:22:40,145 --> 01:22:41,640
Hold on. Hold on.

2307
01:22:41,646 --> 01:22:43,280
- Don't move. - Five dollars.

2308
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:44,880
- That's good. - Okay.

2309
01:22:44,883 --> 01:22:46,250
This is confusing.

2310
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,680
- Is this it? - The last pair remains.

2311
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:49,780
We need to do this.

2312
01:22:49,788 --> 01:22:51,720
Let's go in between them.

2313
01:22:51,723 --> 01:22:53,590
- Seok Jin, send her in. - Right.

2314
01:22:53,592 --> 01:22:54,720
Send her in.

2315
01:22:54,726 --> 01:22:55,890
It will be hard.

2316
01:22:55,894 --> 01:22:56,960
All right.

2317
01:22:56,962 --> 01:22:58,260
Aim for the right.

2318
01:22:58,263 --> 01:23:02,430
(Now that he has the direction, he just needs to throw gently.)

2319
01:23:02,434 --> 01:23:04,655
- No! - I am going too fast.

2320
01:23:05,003 --> 01:23:06,570
(Charging)

2321
01:23:06,571 --> 01:23:09,955
- I am scared! - I am going too fast.

2322
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:12,965
(Say goodbye to paying off your debt.)

2323
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:15,435
I am going too fast.

2324
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:20,105
(Ji Min pushes Ju Yeon off 30 dollars.)

2325
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:23,080
Jong Kook!

2326
01:23:23,088 --> 01:23:24,350
She was like a rocket.

2327
01:23:24,356 --> 01:23:27,205
(Seok Jin and Ji Min get 0 dollars off.)

2328
01:23:27,592 --> 01:23:29,220
This is the last pair.

2329
01:23:29,227 --> 01:23:30,260
(Kwang Soo and Elijah)

2330
01:23:30,262 --> 01:23:32,115
Don't push in this direction.

2331
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:33,690
- Watch your hands. - Okay.

2332
01:23:33,698 --> 01:23:35,100
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2333
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,585
(They refuse to miss the last chance.)

2334
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:39,230
Let's get the exemption.

2335
01:23:39,237 --> 01:23:40,530
(Let's get the exemption.)

2336
01:23:40,538 --> 01:23:41,940
That's your only chance.

2337
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:43,400
- Get ready. - Okay.

2338
01:23:43,408 --> 01:23:44,600
(Exemption, wait for us.)

2339
01:23:44,609 --> 01:23:46,640
That's good.

2340
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:48,565
- That's good. - He did it.

2341
01:23:48,947 --> 01:23:50,365
He did it.

2342
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:54,965
(Let's see if the reduced speed puts her on the exemption.)

2343
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,535
(That's it! Stop right there!)

2344
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:02,390
(Can Kwang Soo and Elijah turn the tables?)

2345
01:24:02,394 --> 01:24:04,560
(Never mind.)

2346
01:24:04,562 --> 01:24:06,685
- Where are you going? - No!

2347
01:24:06,798 --> 01:24:10,230
(With a graceful, ballet-like turn, she loses her chance.)

2348
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:12,885
(Elijah, come here.)

2349
01:24:13,138 --> 01:24:15,185
Hold on. No!

2350
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:18,100
No, Elijah!

2351
01:24:18,109 --> 01:24:19,710
- Welcome. - Elijah!

2352
01:24:19,711 --> 01:24:21,170
We are on the same team.

2353
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:22,735
That was close.

2354
01:24:23,014 --> 01:24:25,505
- That was really close. - That's shocking.

2355
01:24:25,684 --> 01:24:27,505
You aimed perfectly.

2356
01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:29,780
I came to see you, Ji Min.

2357
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:32,020
(The final result)

2358
01:24:32,023 --> 01:24:34,550
(Bobby and Ji Hyo and Jae Seok and Xi A get exempt.)

2359
01:24:34,559 --> 01:24:35,690
(Other pairs have debts.)

2360
01:24:35,694 --> 01:24:37,320
(Whipped cream bomb gets 50 dollars off.)

2361
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,560
(Spanking gets 30 dollars off.)

2362
01:24:39,564 --> 01:24:40,730
(Forehead flick gets 10 dollars off.)

2363
01:24:40,732 --> 01:24:43,200
Seung Ri and So Min, Haha and Sun Mi.

2364
01:24:43,201 --> 01:24:45,070
You are 27 dollars in debt.

2365
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,630
- That's a lot. - That's a lot.

2366
01:24:46,638 --> 01:24:48,440
- Get ready. - I will go first.

2367
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,540
(Race of Wits)

2368
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:50,995
- Start. - One!

2369
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:52,910
(Seung Ri wins alone.)

2370
01:24:52,911 --> 01:24:54,340
Seung Ri won.

2371
01:24:54,346 --> 01:24:55,440
Rock-paper-scissors

2372
01:24:55,447 --> 01:24:56,780
(Ju Yeon wins.)

2373
01:24:56,781 --> 01:24:58,350
Did I win?

2374
01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,805
(Se Chan and B.I get 17 dollars' worth of penalties.)

2375
01:25:00,885 --> 01:25:02,575
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2376
01:25:03,188 --> 01:25:05,390
(Seok Jin and Ji Min get exempt.)

2377
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:06,690
My goodness.

2378
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:08,090
(Kwang Soo and Elijah get 115 dollars' worth of penalties.)

2379
01:25:08,093 --> 01:25:09,160
(Whipped cream bomb gets 50 dollars off.)

2380
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,160
(Spanking gets 30 dollars off.)

2381
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:11,320
(Haha gets 1 spanking.)

2382
01:25:11,329 --> 01:25:12,430
(B.I gets 1 spanking.)

2383
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:14,445
(Kwang Soo gets 1 whipped cream bomb and 2 spankings.)

2384
01:25:14,566 --> 01:25:16,500
- Spank reasonably. - Haha will get one spanking.

2385
01:25:16,501 --> 01:25:18,130
Haha, come.

2386
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:20,930
Please go easy on him.

2387
01:25:20,939 --> 01:25:22,140
It breaks my heart...

2388
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,695
that he bundled up his t-shirt around his butt.

2389
01:25:24,809 --> 01:25:26,710
This much is his t-shirt.

2390
01:25:26,711 --> 01:25:28,935
I feel bad for him.

2391
01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:32,705
(Jae Seok lands a blow without hesitation.)

2392
01:25:32,951 --> 01:25:36,650
(A t-shirt can't stop the electrifying sensation.)

2393
01:25:36,654 --> 01:25:38,235
Are you okay?

2394
01:25:38,556 --> 01:25:39,750
(It's important to pay off your debt on time.)

2395
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:41,450
It wasn't a hard blow. It just made a big sound.

2396
01:25:41,459 --> 01:25:42,820
It just made a big sound.

2397
01:25:42,827 --> 01:25:46,415
- Seung Ri will deliver the blow. - It just made a big sound.

2398
01:25:46,598 --> 01:25:48,285
Okay.

2399
01:25:48,500 --> 01:25:51,160
B.I acted up in front of Seung Ri today.

2400
01:25:51,169 --> 01:25:53,330
Yes, he definitely did. Why do you look so serious?

2401
01:25:53,338 --> 01:25:54,630
Why do you look so determined?

2402
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:56,695
- Here I go. - You'll be fine.

2403
01:25:57,041 --> 01:25:58,510
(Gasping)

2404
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:00,025
Hold on.

2405
01:26:00,645 --> 01:26:02,580
I want iKON's stylists to go somewhere else.

2406
01:26:02,580 --> 01:26:04,440
(Don't gasp there.)

2407
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:06,510
- All of you, iKON's stylists! - Stop that.

2408
01:26:06,518 --> 01:26:08,880
- What are you doing? - What's going on with you?

2409
01:26:08,887 --> 01:26:10,920
- They gasped over there. - This is just a penalty.

2410
01:26:10,922 --> 01:26:12,950
- "Is he really going to do that?" - He must've been holding grudges.

2411
01:26:12,957 --> 01:26:15,005
- It's only a penalty. Stop that. - Get out of the set!

2412
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:16,520
(How hard will he hit B.I?)

2413
01:26:16,528 --> 01:26:18,730
- Hurry up. - Okay.

2414
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:20,290
(Trembling with fear)

2415
01:26:20,298 --> 01:26:21,590
All right. Good luck, iKON.

2416
01:26:21,599 --> 01:26:23,215
(This is the love of a senior singer.)

2417
01:26:23,435 --> 01:26:24,855
(Hitting gently)

2418
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:28,895
(Gosh, he went easy on B.I.)

2419
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:30,900
- Come on, this isn't right. - Do you think it's a joke?

2420
01:26:30,909 --> 01:26:32,710
- Seung Ri should get the spanking. - That was terrible.

2421
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:34,870
- That was an insult to us. - Right.

2422
01:26:34,879 --> 01:26:36,540
He went too easy on B.I.

2423
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:38,950
- Since he went too easy on B.I... - Seung Ri, listen.

2424
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:41,710
- Seung Ri's stylist and agent... - Leave.

2425
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:42,920
should come and watch.

2426
01:26:42,921 --> 01:26:44,120
(He might be awful to you later.)

2427
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:47,250
(The penalty is at its best when watching with everyone.)

2428
01:26:47,258 --> 01:26:49,560
- Yes, this is how it ought to be. - I agree.

2429
01:26:49,561 --> 01:26:50,860
This is how things are done on SBS.

2430
01:26:50,862 --> 01:26:52,685
(Clapping)

2431
01:26:53,398 --> 01:26:54,790
(This is how the national host starts the penalty.)

2432
01:26:54,799 --> 01:26:56,900
Hold on. Wait.

2433
01:26:56,901 --> 01:26:59,430
- Wait a second. Wait. - This is how it's done.

2434
01:26:59,437 --> 01:27:01,970
- He'll spank you without a warning. - Hold on.

2435
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:03,355
Get down.

2436
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:05,565
(He even gets them to cheer.)

2437
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:08,370
(Here's the finale.)

2438
01:27:08,379 --> 01:27:11,695
(Or so you thought.)

2439
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:13,910
(When everyone seems to like it, do it one more time.)

2440
01:27:13,918 --> 01:27:15,150
Wait.

2441
01:27:15,153 --> 01:27:17,420
Hold on. I'm not like an offering. This isn't right.

2442
01:27:17,422 --> 01:27:18,905
(They cooperate at times like this.)

2443
01:27:20,091 --> 01:27:24,390
(When things are heated up...)

2444
01:27:24,395 --> 01:27:26,345
(Spanking)

2445
01:27:27,532 --> 01:27:28,600
(Good luck, Seung Ri.)

2446
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,260
- It doesn't hurt, right? - You're okay, right?

2447
01:27:30,268 --> 01:27:31,870
- It doesn't hurt, right? - It probably hurts.

2448
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,600
(His body experiences the real deal of variety shows.)

2449
01:27:33,605 --> 01:27:35,600
- Are you all right? - You're fine.

2450
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:37,270
- I'm sure that doesn't hurt. - You're fine, right?

2451
01:27:37,275 --> 01:27:38,810
- You're fine. - How is it?

2452
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:40,070
It felt refreshing.

2453
01:27:40,078 --> 01:27:41,070
(Thank you for your lesson.)

2454
01:27:41,079 --> 01:27:44,010
- That was so cool of you. - Great. Well done.

2455
01:27:44,015 --> 01:27:45,510
- Next. - That was great.

2456
01:27:45,517 --> 01:27:46,710
(Kwang Soo's penalty of 115 dollars remains.)

2457
01:27:46,718 --> 01:27:49,120
- Get the stick 1st. - I'll get that 1st.

2458
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:51,380
- This one? - Everyone, it'll splash on you too.

2459
01:27:51,389 --> 01:27:53,205
- Move back, please. - We have to move back.

2460
01:27:53,558 --> 01:27:57,390
- Kwang Soo. Get your cream first. - Yes.

2461
01:27:57,395 --> 01:27:58,745
(Let's make this quick and smooth for you.)

2462
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:01,485
(Getting splashed and spanked)

2463
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,355
Get ready. Here it goes.

2464
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:07,385
Get down. Get down over here.

2465
01:28:07,739 --> 01:28:09,240
(Go get your spanking.)

2466
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,500
- Come here. - Get down.

2467
01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:12,610
Let's go. You need to get the spanking.

2468
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:14,510
Hurry. Stay right there.

2469
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:15,995
(Pale-looking Kwang Soo is dragged.)

2470
01:28:16,014 --> 01:28:19,050
(The system operates like a smooth wheel.)

2471
01:28:19,050 --> 01:28:20,250
(That's the look of a master of variety shows.)

2472
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:23,705
My goodness, this is incredible. This is amazing.

2473
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:26,520
- First spanking. - My goodness.

2474
01:28:26,524 --> 01:28:29,315
(The first spanking sounds clear.)

2475
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:31,120
My goodness.

2476
01:28:31,129 --> 01:28:33,490
(He finishes getting both of his spankings.)

2477
01:28:33,498 --> 01:28:37,855
(Today is a festival for penalties.)

2478
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:41,230
Go home. Go home now.

2479
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:43,195
(Kwang Soo places first during such festivals.)

2480
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:44,840
- Xi A, go home. Go home, Ju Yeon. - Okay.

2481
01:28:44,842 --> 01:28:46,170
It's 4 to 3. 4 to 3.

2482
01:28:46,177 --> 01:28:47,870
(That was random.)

2483
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:48,980
What? 4 to 3?

2484
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,180
- Okay! - Yes!

2485
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:53,150
(Everyone's focus is on the soccer match right before the shoot ends.)

2486
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:54,910
- We did it. - Hey, we scored a goal.

2487
01:28:54,919 --> 01:28:57,220
- It's 4 to 3. - Are you serious?

2488
01:28:57,221 --> 01:28:59,750
- What is this? - Yes! Go, Korea!

2489
01:28:59,757 --> 01:29:00,990
(Cheering)

2490
01:29:00,992 --> 01:29:03,045
(He cheers with them for Korea though.)

2491
01:29:03,127 --> 01:29:04,475
This is awesome.

2492
01:29:04,596 --> 01:29:07,690
(We thank Elijah, E Xi A, Lee Ju Yeon, Sun Mi, Kim Ji Min,)

2493
01:29:07,699 --> 01:29:11,155
(Seung Ri, Bobby, and B.I for running with us.)

2494
01:29:11,502 --> 01:29:13,885
(A mysterious briefcase arrives for the members.)

2495
01:29:14,973 --> 01:29:18,255
(Deliver the briefcase within the time limit.)

2496
01:29:18,476 --> 01:29:20,210
(They shouldn't have accepted the offer.)

2497
01:29:20,211 --> 01:29:22,865
(The moment they accepted the offer, everything began.)

2498
01:29:22,947 --> 01:29:25,905
(Mysterious movements loom over them.)

2499
01:29:25,917 --> 01:29:28,865
(They can't give up even if they want to.)

2500
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,475
(They can't escape until they accomplish the mission.)

2501
01:29:31,489 --> 01:29:33,850
(And...)

2502
01:29:33,858 --> 01:29:36,020
(guests, who puzzle the members even more, show up.)

2503
01:29:36,027 --> 01:29:37,720
(GOT7, idol singers who bring the best episodes)

2504
01:29:37,729 --> 01:29:39,185
J-black.

2505
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,945
(J-black and Mmary, dancing couple, Yu Seung Ok, the healthiest woman)

2506
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:46,255
(The battle is strange, but it's even more dangerous.)

2507
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:50,440
(Only victory can complete their delivery.)

2508
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:51,600
This is hard. It's hard.

2509
01:29:51,609 --> 01:29:55,170
(Will the members be able to escape from the fiery pits of delivery?)

2510
01:29:55,179 --> 01:29:56,695
Gosh, that startled me.

2511
01:29:56,748 --> 01:29:58,535
(Dangerous Delivery)
