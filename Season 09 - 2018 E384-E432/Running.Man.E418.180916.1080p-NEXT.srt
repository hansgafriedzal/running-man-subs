1
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:07,815
(SBS Open Hall, Deungchon-dong)

2
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello. Hello.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,515
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:15,730
Seok Jin, your steps are light.

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:16,840
- What? - Your steps are light.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,525
- He is in a good mood. - You know why.

7
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,970
His steps are bound to be light since his legs are so thin.

8
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:26,210
(He attacks Seok Jin's paper-thin legs.)

9
00:00:26,216 --> 00:00:27,665
Hey.

10
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:29,750
I think you will fly soon.

11
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,220
For goodness' sake.

12
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:34,220
- Perhaps he will fly like this. - Gosh.

13
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:37,405
Gosh, you have so much mold on the back of your neck.

14
00:00:37,427 --> 00:00:40,190
Why did you tell him that?

15
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:42,230
They are pimples!

16
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:45,000
Seok Jin is getting attacked left and right.

17
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,585
Seriously.

18
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:48,185
What is that?

19
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,500
- It startled me. - It's a drone.

20
00:00:50,507 --> 00:00:53,055
- What is going on? - Is it delivering a mission card?

21
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,410
It really has a mission card.

22
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:56,510
(The drone delivers a mission card.)

23
00:00:56,513 --> 00:00:57,880
- How fascinating! - Is it delivering a mission card?

24
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,240
- Do we need to catch it? - Look over there.

25
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:00,750
Is this how we are getting a mission card?

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,410
Catch it gently.

27
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,150
- Step back. - Come on.

28
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,880
- Catch it gently. - Step back.

29
00:01:05,889 --> 00:01:07,250
- Catch it gently. - There you go.

30
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:08,520
- Bye. - Bye.

31
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:12,320
- Seok Jin. - My goodness.

32
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:13,715
(Snapping)

33
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,200
- What? - My goodness.

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,700
- Jae Seok! - Hey!

35
00:01:19,703 --> 00:01:22,830
(The drone catches on the string Jae Seok flicked.)

36
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:24,470
- Hey. - Do you know how much it costs?

37
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,200
Do you know how much it costs?

38
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:27,510
- I am sorry. - I am sorry.

39
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,210
- Pay for it. - For goodness' sake.

40
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:31,510
It was Jae Seok. It was Jae Seok.

41
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:33,580
- Jae Seok. Jae Seok. - Seriously.

42
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,580
Here is the drone. I am sorry.

43
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,250
Jae Seok, what do you think you are doing?

44
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:38,820
What do you think you are doing?

45
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:40,320
I will pay back for it.

46
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:41,690
- It's okay. - I am sorry.

47
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,320
Jae Seok will pay back for it.

48
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:46,290
- I am sorry. - He is a troublemaker.

49
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:47,790
It's not like that.

50
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:49,430
There are people who always break machines.

51
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,960
I will be sure...

52
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:52,800
- to pay for it. - He is a troublemaker.

53
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,655
Don't touch anything.

54
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,340
- He gave me a scare. - Goodness.

55
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,900
- My goodness. - What is this?

56
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,000
What does it say?

57
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:02,540
"Dangerous Delivery, Briefcase Delivery".

58
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:05,210
(Dangerous Delivery, Briefcase Delivery)

59
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:09,165
"Deliver the briefcase to the final destination within six hours."

60
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:11,920
"If you deliver the briefcase, only one member will face the penalty,"

61
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,250
"but if you fail, only one member will be exempt from the penalty."

62
00:02:15,258 --> 00:02:17,745
- Only one? - "Roulettes will pick the member."

63
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:21,360
"You can find out the address if you complete three missions."

64
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,500
"Warning. You cannot open the briefcase."

65
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,900
(The moment they open it, everyone will face the penalty.)

66
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,000
If you do, you fail the mission, and everyone will face the penalty.

67
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:28,515
If we open it, we all fail?

68
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,955
We have to deliver this within six hours?

69
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:34,110
Don't give it to Jae Seok.

70
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,540
- He can't be in charge of that. - He will destroy the briefcase too.

71
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:38,925
Don't let him touch the roulettes. He might break them too.

72
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:40,580
Jae Seok, be careful with your hands.

73
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,110
- Ji Hyo is the safest bet. - I can't believe you all.

74
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,620
- You're too mean. - Right?

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,850
- I'm begging you. - Yes?

76
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:46,850
How about we give it to Seok Jin? He hates carrying things.

77
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:49,220
(How about we give it to Seok Jin? He hates carrying things.)

78
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:51,205
- That's a good idea. - Yes, let's give it to him.

79
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:55,060
(Let's have the lazy guy carry this.)

80
00:02:55,064 --> 00:02:57,130
- Hey! - We must change things around.

81
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,285
- I don't even carry umbrellas. - Listen.

82
00:02:59,469 --> 00:03:00,770
- Hey. - He should carry this.

83
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,885
- He should. Right. - That was a good idea.

84
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,385
He should...

85
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,670
- He should carry the briefcase. - He hates carrying things.

86
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:08,170
- He should give it a try. - I agree.

87
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:10,425
- This is crazy. - Don't use it as a pillow though.

88
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:12,325
- What a hassle. - He should carry this.

89
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:14,610
It's better that I carry important things.

90
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,195
(He changes his stance.)

91
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:18,905
The first hint is at stake on this mission.

92
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,350
It's called Snack from the Drone.

93
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:22,350
- Drone? - What?

94
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:23,975
(First mission, Snack from the Drone)

95
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,020
For three minutes,

96
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,630
one of you will control the drone that will carry the snack.

97
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,700
To succeed, the rest of you must eat five pieces of snacks...

98
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,615
with mouthpieces on.

99
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:36,515
If you succeed, you will receive a hint about the destination.

100
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,600
- Is this the controller? - What is this?

101
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,310
(Before the game, everyone practices flying drones.)

102
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,670
- My gosh. - It worked!

103
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:43,325
- What happened? - Whose drone is that?

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,580
(Jong Kook flies the drone skillfully as soon as they start.)

105
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,565
(Then let me try too.)

106
00:03:50,753 --> 00:03:51,920
This is working nicely.

107
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,020
(Crashing)

108
00:03:53,022 --> 00:03:54,420
What did you just do?

109
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:57,875
(Seok Jin's drone crashes into Jong Kook's in the air.)

110
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,430
(What is going on with that guy?)

111
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,515
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

112
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,230
The instructor is here.

113
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,300
- Hey! - We have the instructor here.

114
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,570
(It's fine. Let me try it one more time.)

115
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,970
- It's flying. Hey, it's flying. - It's flying.

116
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,100
- Come here. - No, no.

117
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,600
- Where are you going? This way! - We invited the instructor.

118
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:13,570
(It makes an emergency landing on top of the staff.)

119
00:04:13,576 --> 00:04:15,955
(What? Why did that end up there?)

120
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,210
- What's up with him? It's scary. - Where is mine?

121
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,035
- Bring it down. - Bring it down.

122
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:23,650
- Here it is. - My gosh.

123
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:26,450
- We have instructors here. - I like this one.

124
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:29,135
This moves the drone to the left, and this, to the right.

125
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,720
I got it. I mastered this.

126
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,790
(As they learn how to control it, they're getting a hang of it.)

127
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,245
Gosh, I'm really good at this.

128
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,330
(They eagerly try to fly the drones in the air.)

129
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,615
I can do this too. I don't need the controller.

130
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,555
My goodness, this is awesome.

131
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,170
This is perfect.

132
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:45,400
Look at this.

133
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:47,340
(Completing the mission won't be a problem.)

134
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:49,495
- Hey, this is easy. - That's mine.

135
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,840
(Meanwhile, Seok Jin is...)

136
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,910
(Gosh! That startled me.)

137
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,935
(Even after the lesson, he's not good at flying the drone.)

138
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,635
This is so easy.

139
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,805
The staff is in trouble. It's so easy to fly this.

140
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,875
To the left.

141
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,435
Go straight.

142
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,020
(This middle-aged man has lost the sense of directions.)

143
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,445
How am I supposed to do this?

144
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:11,445
Look at this. You must be able to do this, at least.

145
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:15,515
(He patiently continues to practice despite their teasing.)

146
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,685
Hey, it went over the fence.

147
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,900
(The drone goes over the fence.)

148
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,755
Wait, the drone went over.

149
00:05:21,978 --> 00:05:25,780
(As he's unable to control the drone, it goes out of the set.)

150
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:27,295
I can't fly this.

151
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,480
How am I supposed to fly this?

152
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:32,220
(Seok Jin is in big trouble just like the size of his big nose.)

153
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,650
Choose the member that will fly the drone.

154
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:35,950
- Pardon? - I'm really confident I can do it.

155
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:37,460
- I'm serious. - Let him fly it.

156
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,590
- Even the instructors approved. - Let's play a game.

157
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:39,790
- Anyone should do it. - I'll do it.

158
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,675
- I'm really good at this. - Then...

159
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,090
- Gosh. - Let's play Race of Wits.

160
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,530
(Let's play Race of Wits.)

161
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:46,060
- Again? - Hey.

162
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,400
- He's addicted to that game. - That's enough.

163
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,770
- Get out if you don't want to play. - He's addicted to the game.

164
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,995
- Fine, let's play it. - Why do you like that game so much?

165
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,980
- Get out if you don't want to play. - You're addicted to that.

166
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,195
- Let's play it. - Start.

167
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:00,410
- 1. - 2.

168
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,780
- 3. - 4.

169
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:03,135
- 5. - 6.

170
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:05,850
- The three of you are out. - You're out.

171
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:08,505
(Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan are out.)

172
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,520
The three of you are out. They are out.

173
00:06:10,526 --> 00:06:11,945
(I knew it. It's so much fun.)

174
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,230
- Let's stop playing this game. - This is unbelievable.

175
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,890
- Come on. - This is so unfair.

176
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,445
- Start. - One.

177
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,115
- 2. - 3.

178
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,270
(Jae Seok and So Min are out.)

179
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,315
- What's wrong with you? - Jae Seok.

180
00:06:23,673 --> 00:06:24,840
Should we play rock-paper-scissors?

181
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:27,055
(The last 3 members play rock-paper-scissors.)

182
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:29,255
- Darn it. - Rock-paper-scissors

183
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,340
(Seok Jin is chosen to fly the drone.)

184
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,125
- No! - My gosh.

185
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:34,280
Okay!

186
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:36,480
(That guy is going to control the drone?)

187
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,080
He's going to ruin our faces.

188
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:39,720
- What are we going to do? - He can't fly that.

189
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:41,590
- No, no. - How could you be so clueless?

190
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:43,590
- He's not delicate enough. - My gosh.

191
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:44,890
- Why not? - You know what?

192
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:46,960
- We have to get the hint. - Exactly.

193
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:48,790
Someone who can fly it well should do it.

194
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:50,615
(The hint depends on Seok Jin's drone.)

195
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,330
- It has to go up after that. - Right.

196
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:55,755
Up, up, up.

197
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:57,400
- Try again. - Turn it on again.

198
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,185
- Fly it up again. - Turn it on first.

199
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:01,455
(Whizzing)

200
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,840
(The drone heads underground.)

201
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,480
Seok Jin, is this a drill?

202
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:09,150
I don't think we can hang the snack on it.

203
00:07:09,152 --> 00:07:10,865
You did it. You got it, Seok Jin.

204
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,850
- You have to fly it high. - Hold on.

205
00:07:12,855 --> 00:07:15,720
My goodness, come on. Seriously?

206
00:07:15,725 --> 00:07:17,160
(His out-of-the-set flying makes them more anxious.)

207
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,460
What are you doing?

208
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,160
What will we do? We're in trouble.

209
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:22,390
Can you bring me that back?

210
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:25,260
(He's shameless.)

211
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,400
- What are you doing? - Whom are you talking to?

212
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,530
- Whom are you talking to? - What?

213
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,270
- Whom are you talking to? - What do you think you're doing?

214
00:07:30,273 --> 00:07:33,485
- What's wrong with him? - What are you doing?

215
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:35,270
(The middle-aged man is about to fly the drone.)

216
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:37,910
- Let's do this. - Hey, I'm going to do this well.

217
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:40,010
(They must eat 5 pieces of snack within 3 minutes to get the hint.)

218
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:42,150
- Let's go. - All right.

219
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,565
Get ready.

220
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:46,150
(Seok Jin's drone takes off.)

221
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,075
- Bring that here. - Move it to the front.

222
00:07:48,658 --> 00:07:50,945
- Move it to the front. - To the front.

223
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:53,505
Okay, okay. Wait, Seok Jin.

224
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:54,890
You have to change the direction.

225
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,660
- Wait, no, no. - Bring it down.

226
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,115
Lower the drone.

227
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,530
(You just need to lower it from where it is now.)

228
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,915
- Lower it. - Lower it. Kwang Soo...

229
00:08:06,642 --> 00:08:09,470
(He did lower it, but he lowered it too quickly.)

230
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,365
(Who knew he'd lower it like that?)

231
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:13,865
(Kwang Soo, I'm sorry.)

232
00:08:14,283 --> 00:08:15,280
(1 minute has passed already.)

233
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,935
Hold on. We'll go there.

234
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,850
- We got it. We got it. - It's close.

235
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:21,505
It's close. Eat it.

236
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,020
Eat it. Hey...

237
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,790
(They're only darting their tongues.)

238
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,945
Hey! Get your tongue away!

239
00:08:28,664 --> 00:08:30,885
(What on earth is going on?)

240
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:32,945
Get your tongue away from mine.

241
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,270
(Slapping)

242
00:08:36,272 --> 00:08:37,900
- Move it away. - Eat it.

243
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:40,240
Why can't you eat it? I can't make it easier for you.

244
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:42,040
- I can't make it easier than this. - Lower it.

245
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,810
- Lower it. Lower it! - Ji Hyo will go for it.

246
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:46,240
(The best player, Ji Hyo, will try.)

247
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:48,735
- Give us a new one. - Give that to me.

248
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,880
- She ate it. - Okay. She ate it.

249
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:53,550
- She ate it. - She ate it.

250
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,075
Okay, we did one.

251
00:08:55,124 --> 00:08:56,990
Gosh, that was really hard.

252
00:08:56,993 --> 00:08:58,190
- Bring it here. - Wait.

253
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,520
- Ji Hyo. - Okay.

254
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,915
(Laughing)

255
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,060
Why?

256
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:06,900
(Give me my snack!)

257
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:08,000
(Why did you hit me?)

258
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:09,530
- Lower it. - Where is this going?

259
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,185
- Lower the drone. - What's he doing?

260
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,270
This isn't supposed to...

261
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:17,110
(This lovely snack runs away when they approach it.)

262
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,440
(Slapping)

263
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,640
I almost had it.

264
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:21,010
(He slaps Kwang Soo out of strong enthusiasm.)

265
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,565
Jae Seok, I almost had it.

266
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,905
Eat it. Come on, eat that.

267
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:26,820
- Lower the snack. - It hurts.

268
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,475
- Okay. - The time is up.

269
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:31,390
- We should've kept going. - Hey.

270
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,160
This is impossible.

271
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:35,490
- It was too high for us to reach. - No, no.

272
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:37,500
- It's the drone. - You just had to lower it.

273
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,200
- I did an excellent job. - Flying drones is easy.

274
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:41,070
- Let me give it a try. - It was too hard.

275
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,370
Let's win this. We have to deliver it in six hours.

276
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:47,725
(The time is ticking. We only have 5 hours left.)

277
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,370
Start.

278
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,810
(During the practice, Haha was able to fly the drone well.)

279
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:54,195
- Haha is good at this. - Yes, he's good.

280
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:56,450
Let's do this.

281
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:57,750
(The direction is good. And so is the height.)

282
00:09:57,753 --> 00:09:59,020
- Bring it closer. - Closer.

283
00:09:59,021 --> 00:10:00,920
- Jae Seok. - It has to come closer.

284
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:03,290
- Bring it closer. To the left. - Slowly.

285
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:06,305
(He skillfully flies it to the tall guy, Kwang Soo.)

286
00:10:06,929 --> 00:10:08,760
- Okay. - Okay, okay.

287
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:12,200
(Haha feeds 1 piece as soon as he starts, thanks to Kwang Soo.)

288
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,930
- Fly it. Okay. - Come here.

289
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:15,285
(Let me help too.)

290
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,170
- Okay. - It's Jae Seok's.

291
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:18,770
- Jae Seok. - I'm literally feeding it to you.

292
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,185
It's Jae Seok's.

293
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,910
(It's my chance. I just need to munch on it.)

294
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,180
- Lower it. - It's Jae Seok's.

295
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:28,835
- Jae Seok. - It's Jae Seok's.

296
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,020
- Come here. - Don't shake the snack.

297
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,835
It keeps shaking because of the wind.

298
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:36,050
(When I move in,)

299
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:37,150
Come on, Jae Seok.

300
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,660
(you make a retreat.)

301
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:40,260
- What are you doing? - Eat it.

302
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,560
Eat it.

303
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:42,790
- This isn't hard. - Move!

304
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:45,285
- This isn't hard. - Come on. Move! Move!

305
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,170
(Tired of Jae Seok's playing, Jong Kook sets out.)

306
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,430
Raise it. Fly it high.

307
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:51,785
(He bites the string first with his teeth.)

308
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:54,810
There you go. Good job. Good riddance.

309
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,810
You'll end up eating the drone.

310
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,240
Come here. Come to us.

311
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,440
- Lower it. Lower it. - Lower it.

312
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,195
- It's yours, Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

313
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:03,150
That's it.

314
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:05,520
(They successfully eat 3 pieces in a row.)

315
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,650
Wait.

316
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,050
- Is he a man or a machine? - Wait.

317
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:09,635
(They're shocked.)

318
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,360
(They must eat 2 pieces in 1 minute.)

319
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,020
- Lower it. - It's Seok Jin's.

320
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:14,160
You can do it!

321
00:11:14,163 --> 00:11:17,845
(Haha skillfully flies the drone right in front of Seok Jin.)

322
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,670
(He's so close.)

323
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,270
- Did he eat it? - No, no.

324
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,055
- He can eat it. - He can reach it.

325
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:29,170
Use your teeth. Use your teeth.

326
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:31,740
(The snack is playing hard-to-get.)

327
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:33,825
Why can't you eat this?

328
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,595
- Why can't you eat this? - Ji Hyo, you go for it.

329
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:38,805
(Crunching)

330
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:42,120
(She eats the snack on Seok Jin's back.)

331
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,490
- She ate it. - She got it.

332
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:44,905
My goodness.

333
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:46,890
- Bring it to us. - Haha.

334
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:48,190
Move this way.

335
00:11:48,197 --> 00:11:50,630
- Come quickly. - Why can't I fly this higher?

336
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:52,260
(The snack is even playing hard-to-get with the pilot.)

337
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:53,760
- Gosh, seriously, Haha? - Wait.

338
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:57,670
(Due to his terrible flying, Jong Kook falls into the trap too.)

339
00:11:57,673 --> 00:11:59,025
Hey.

340
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,170
(We only had one piece left to go.)

341
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:02,670
- You're unbelievable. - You said you were good at this.

342
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,940
- I'm sorry. - He's drooling.

343
00:12:03,946 --> 00:12:05,640
(They fail their 2nd round by a close call.)

344
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,735
- Ready. Hook your arms. - Ready.

345
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,650
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

346
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,020
- We can do this. - We can do this.

347
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,290
(Time is running out. We have to succeed this time.)

348
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,290
Let's do this!

349
00:12:16,292 --> 00:12:17,690
- You can do this. - Let's go.

350
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:20,205
Ready, go.

351
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:22,130
(Jong Kook's drone takes off.)

352
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:24,260
Good. Keep going.

353
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,430
(The dark horse's drone flies stably.)

354
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:26,500
Higher.

355
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:27,770
- Higher. - Lower it.

356
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,030
Lower it.

357
00:12:29,038 --> 00:12:30,800
- Lower it. - Lower it.

358
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,440
- Lower it. - A bit more.

359
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,670
- Lower it. - Even more.

360
00:12:33,676 --> 00:12:35,455
(It is approaching Se Chan.)

361
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:38,010
(Se Chan eats the snack as soon as they start.)

362
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:39,725
- Done! - Okay.

363
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:42,650
(So Min, it's your turn.)

364
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,065
Move!

365
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:45,665
Eat it!

366
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:47,280
(So Min eats the 2nd snack.)

367
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,890
- Done. - Done.

368
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:50,650
(Hey, your mouthpiece came off.)

369
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:54,075
(So Min's mouthpiece comes off.)

370
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,790
Put it back on.

371
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:56,890
(She was overzealous.)

372
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:59,560
- Put it back on. - Here we go.

373
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:00,900
Let's do this.

374
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,485
Stay there.

375
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,170
- Good. - It's for Se Chan.

376
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:05,725
Hurry!

377
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,440
(Biting)

378
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:10,040
(Se Chan gets the 3rd snack.)

379
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:11,695
- Done. - Done.

380
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:13,610
We've eaten three.

381
00:13:13,616 --> 00:13:15,110
Two more to go.

382
00:13:15,117 --> 00:13:16,435
We can do it.

383
00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:18,165
- Is it good? - Stop.

384
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,280
Stop.

385
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:21,575
(The 4th snack approaches Seok Jin.)

386
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,160
Good. Go near it.

387
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,575
(Will he make up for his previous mistake?)

388
00:13:28,164 --> 00:13:29,715
Seok Jin.

389
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,445
(Falling)

390
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:36,155
(Seok Jin makes everyone fall.)

391
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,040
Gosh.

392
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,170
What is this?

393
00:13:39,175 --> 00:13:40,240
(Jong Kook can't believe it.)

394
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:42,370
- We need to hook our arms. - Hurry.

395
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:43,810
(There is only 40 seconds left now.)

396
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,565
Slowly.

397
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,010
Good.

398
00:13:47,016 --> 00:13:49,310
(It's so close.)

399
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:50,750
I'm doing such a good job. Why can't you eat it?

400
00:13:50,753 --> 00:13:51,920
- Good. - Eat it.

401
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:52,980
Here!

402
00:13:52,988 --> 00:13:54,020
(Ji Hyo eats the 4th snack.)

403
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,290
Done!

404
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,920
- Done! - Go!

405
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,060
There's 30 seconds left.

406
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,820
Okay. We have to eat just one more.

407
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:01,715
- Move! - It's here.

408
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:03,930
(Let's succeed by all means.)

409
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:05,345
- Stay there! - Stay!

410
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,645
Eat it. Be careful.

411
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,415
(Screaming)

412
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,940
(Jae Seok bites Kwang Soo's neck.)

413
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,825
What happened?

414
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,610
- Why were you there? - Okay.

415
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,380
Why were you there?

416
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:21,010
The snack was right in front of me.

417
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:22,280
Mission complete!

418
00:14:22,284 --> 00:14:24,450
(They complete the Snack from the Drone mission.)

419
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,980
I bit something soft, and it was your cheek.

420
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:29,435
(I bit something soft, and it was your cheek.)

421
00:14:29,792 --> 00:14:32,120
You completed your first mission.

422
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,505
That's a relief.

423
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:34,890
Where's our briefcase?

424
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:35,890
(By the way...)

425
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:37,360
- Where is it? - Where is it?

426
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,530
(Where did our briefcase go?)

427
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:41,170
- Where did it go? - Where is it?

428
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,170
Our briefcase is gone.

429
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:44,300
(They lose their briefcase while trying to win a hint.)

430
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:45,900
What's wrong with you?

431
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:47,370
- It's gone. - It was here before.

432
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:49,740
- It's here. Gosh. - Why did you take it?

433
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:51,965
(Relieved)

434
00:14:52,014 --> 00:14:53,680
Whom are you talking to?

435
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:55,150
Whom are you trying to blame?

436
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,650
- What is this? - You shouldn't leave it with me.

437
00:14:57,653 --> 00:14:59,150
- I... - We're leaving it with you.

438
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,280
Please don't.

439
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:01,490
It's dangerous.

440
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,790
- Gosh. - Here.

441
00:15:02,791 --> 00:15:05,760
(They receive a hint regarding the delivery place.)

442
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,530
- Yangcheon District? - We've gotten the address.

443
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,130
It's close from here.

444
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,585
- It's close. - That's right.

445
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:16,730
(They have to deliver the briefcase to Yangcheon District in time.)

446
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,640
(If they fail, everyone except 1 person will be penalized.)

447
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:22,040
The two roulette wheels will be filled with your names...

448
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:24,780
according to the game results and votes.

449
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,810
There will be votes?

450
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:27,880
To decide who will be exempt and who will be penalized,

451
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,280
you'll play 4-on-4 Drone Soccer.

452
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:31,420
- Drone soccer? - Drone soccer?

453
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,705
(4-on-4 Drone Soccer)

454
00:15:33,022 --> 00:15:36,190
2 teams of 4 players will compete to fly drones through the goalposts.

455
00:15:36,192 --> 00:15:38,420
The team who gains 3 points 1st will win.

456
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:39,520
(They gain a point by flying a drone through the goalpost.)

457
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:41,915
(The team who gains 3 points 1st will win.)

458
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,690
The winners' names will be put on the Exempt roulette wheel,

459
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:46,660
and the losers' on the Penalty roulette wheel.

460
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:47,870
(Winners on the Exempt roulette, and losers on the Penalty roulette)

461
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,670
Please divide into 2 teams of 4.

462
00:15:50,673 --> 00:15:52,825
- Young members should team up. - Right.

463
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,240
Are you sure you belong there?

464
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,740
(Haha is 40.)

465
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:01,250
When you said that, I wanted to go there too.

466
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,310
You're 40. Go away.

467
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,150
- Come here. - If you're in your 40s, go away.

468
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,620
- Come here. - This is not okay.

469
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:06,650
If you're in your 40s, come here.

470
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,150
It doesn't feel like I'm in my 40s.

471
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:09,890
You're in your 40s. If you're in your 50s, go away.

472
00:16:09,892 --> 00:16:11,920
(If you're in your 50s, go away.)

473
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,660
(Seok Jin, you're in your 50s. Go away.)

474
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,160
- If you're in your 50s... - I'm alone on my team?

475
00:16:15,164 --> 00:16:16,930
Shouldn't someone in his 50s be excluded?

476
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,030
(All the other members are in their 40s.)

477
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,360
He should be...

478
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,815
I'm alone?

479
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:24,170
So Min and Ji Hyo will play rock-paper-scissors...

480
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:25,270
- They'll choose their members. - and choose their members.

481
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,300
- Okay. - Okay.

482
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:28,440
Having flown a drone makes a big difference.

483
00:16:28,444 --> 00:16:30,170
I fly drones as a hobby.

484
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,410
- I have one at home. - I didn't want to say this.

485
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:33,110
He's obsessed with drones.

486
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:36,010
(He's obsessed with drones.)

487
00:16:36,018 --> 00:16:37,880
What? What was that?

488
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:39,580
You're very good at it.

489
00:16:39,588 --> 00:16:41,120
- He's obsessed. - You're so good.

490
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:42,150
He's obsessed.

491
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,250
I am.

492
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,860
- I am obsessed. - Is that...

493
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,475
- It should be your nickname. - He's very good.

494
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:51,260
(Team members)

495
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,500
(So Min and Ji Hyo have chosen their team members.)

496
00:16:53,502 --> 00:16:54,570
1st half and 2nd half?

497
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,670
I'll play in the first half.

498
00:16:55,671 --> 00:16:57,770
Jong Kook and I seem to be the best players among us.

499
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:59,670
Be quiet.

500
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:02,195
- Let's do this. - Seriously.

501
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,925
I'll be Lee Seung Woo. You want to be Son Heung Min?

502
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:07,280
I'll be Jo Hyeon Woo. The goalkeeper.

503
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,280
Jo Hyeon Woo?

504
00:17:08,284 --> 00:17:10,410
You should attack. I'll defend.

505
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:12,550
- Okay. I'll be Lee Seung Woo. - I'll be Jo Hyeon Woo.

506
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,650
Can you even control your drones?

507
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,750
Of course.

508
00:17:15,758 --> 00:17:17,220
(We're on the national team at heart.)

509
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:18,860
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

510
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:20,390
- We can do this! - Here we go!

511
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:21,660
- Let's go! - Let's go!

512
00:17:21,664 --> 00:17:22,990
Ready.

513
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:24,160
Win just three points.

514
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,600
(In case they fail to deliver the briefcase,)

515
00:17:26,602 --> 00:17:29,415
(they have to aim to win this game.)

516
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,885
(The first half starts.)

517
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,210
That's so cool.

518
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:39,365
(Yang Hyeon Woo and Ha Seung Woo start to move.)

519
00:17:40,149 --> 00:17:43,195
(Kwang Soo's drone moves forward.)

520
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,180
(Kwang Soo's drone approaches the goalpost.)

521
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:49,205
(This is not okay. I have to stop that.)

522
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,890
(Se Chan's drone comes back immediately.)

523
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:55,615
(Se Chan blocks Kwang Soo.)

524
00:17:56,065 --> 00:17:57,590
I blocked him.

525
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,260
(This is how goalkeeper Yang Hyeon Woo plays.)

526
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:01,655
- I blocked him. - Good job.

527
00:18:02,338 --> 00:18:03,970
Se Chan blocked Kwang Soo.

528
00:18:03,972 --> 00:18:05,140
Good job.

529
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,300
(Se Chan, good job.)

530
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:08,440
- Way to go, Se Chan! - Defend!

531
00:18:08,444 --> 00:18:11,095
Get it in!

532
00:18:12,214 --> 00:18:13,680
(I won't let you make a goal.)

533
00:18:13,682 --> 00:18:15,695
- Get it in! - Get it in!

534
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,735
- Get it in! - Get it in!

535
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,705
(It's time to attack.)

536
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:25,460
Okay. Haha.

537
00:18:25,461 --> 00:18:27,160
Get it in.

538
00:18:27,162 --> 00:18:28,360
(Haha wins a goal with Se Chan's help.)

539
00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:32,800
(Team So Min 1, Team Ji Hyo 0)

540
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:34,185
Good job!

541
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,070
(Let's make another goal.)

542
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:37,870
Goal! Okay!

543
00:18:37,873 --> 00:18:39,285
(Se Chan makes the 2nd goal.)

544
00:18:39,408 --> 00:18:40,600
One more.

545
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:43,295
(The 1st half ends 2 to 0.)

546
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:45,380
- Good job. - It wasn't bad.

547
00:18:45,381 --> 00:18:46,880
- That was good. - You did a great job.

548
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:48,150
- It wasn't bad. - You did very well.

549
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,550
Why are you so bad?

550
00:18:49,551 --> 00:18:51,420
- Show me how good you are. - Kwang Soo did well.

551
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,550
Show me.

552
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:55,150
(The players are switched.)

553
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,975
(Seok Jin and So Min versus Ji Hyo and Jae Seok.)

554
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:00,820
(Second half)

555
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:01,930
Higher!

556
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,475
Here we go!

557
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,960
(We need to make just one more goal.)

558
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:07,585
(Bumping)

559
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:11,625
(Seok Jin is lost from the beginning.)

560
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,585
(So Min is wandering too.)

561
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,440
Get in the right direction.

562
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,125
Get in the right direction first.

563
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:20,925
(The atmosphere is completely different from the first half.)

564
00:19:22,451 --> 00:19:24,395
To the right. Okay. Higher!

565
00:19:24,653 --> 00:19:26,580
Higher!

566
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:28,420
Go up!

567
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,875
(The drone is near the goalpost.)

568
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,145
Keep going. Okay!

569
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:35,990
(With Jae Seok's goal, the score is now 2 to 1.)

570
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:37,730
Just one more goal.

571
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,660
Ji Hyo, just one more goal!

572
00:19:39,668 --> 00:19:41,185
Try again.

573
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,455
- Hold on! - Come here!

574
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:44,900
(Ji Hyo moves forward calmly.)

575
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:46,700
Turn it!

576
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:47,940
(Bumping)

577
00:19:47,943 --> 00:19:49,910
(The drone bumps into the goalpost.)

578
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,810
Ji Hyo, lower it!

579
00:19:51,814 --> 00:19:53,095
Move.

580
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:54,935
Lower it!

581
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,365
(Flying)

582
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:01,150
(It just passes by the goalpost?)

583
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,190
(Hitting)

584
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:04,190
(It hits So Min's head.)

585
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:05,590
So Min...

586
00:20:05,594 --> 00:20:07,060
- Get it in! - It's in!

587
00:20:07,062 --> 00:20:08,160
It's in.

588
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,730
(Thanks to So Min's header,)

589
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,600
(Ji Hyo scores an equalizer.)

590
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,300
- It's in! - It's in.

591
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:15,755
It's in.

592
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,700
(Team So Min 2, Team Ji Hyo 2)

593
00:20:17,706 --> 00:20:20,125
It's a tie. Just one more goal!

594
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:22,570
- Go straight. - Hold on.

595
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,210
Seok Jin!

596
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:27,440
(Seok Jin's drone moves straight towards the goalpost.)

597
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,050
- Jae Seok, stop him! - Seok Jin!

598
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,365
(Will he be able to make a goal?)

599
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,865
Goal!

600
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:38,445
(Seok Jin scores the winning goal.)

601
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:40,690
(Seok Jin did it!)

602
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:42,160
- It's in. We win, right? - It's over.

603
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,430
- It's over. - We win.

604
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:44,630
- Seok Jin. - At the end...

605
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:45,830
Seok Jin.

606
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,560
- I scored the golden goal. - Golden goal.

607
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:49,685
I couldn't do anything.

608
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,070
(Too bad. We almost won.)

609
00:20:51,073 --> 00:20:52,485
It was so close.

610
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,410
(Team Ji Hyo loses by a narrow margin.)

611
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,410
(Their names go on the Penalty roulette wheel.)

612
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,295
(Penalty, Exempt)

613
00:21:00,182 --> 00:21:01,580
- What's this? - What's this?

614
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,710
We have to do a good job.

615
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,820
(Two drones?)

616
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,080
I'll do a good job this time.

617
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:07,920
I got it.

618
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,605
I'll do a good job this time.

619
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,445
(Kwang Soo intercepts it.)

620
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:15,890
(Jae Seok might damage it again.)

621
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:17,090
Very good.

622
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:18,100
You did a good job.

623
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,800
What are you doing?

624
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:21,145
I wanted to catch it.

625
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:22,230
(They receive a new mission.)

626
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,130
- Street dance? - Street?

627
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:25,340
(Street dance?)

628
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,125
- Flying yoga? - Flying yoga?

629
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:30,755
You can choose between street dance and flying yoga.

630
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:33,965
You'll divide into 2 teams of 4.

631
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:35,835
I choose street dance.

632
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,850
- I don't like yoga. - I quit dancing.

633
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,650
(I choose flying yoga.)

634
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:40,950
Yoga?

635
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,090
The dance style I pursue is...

636
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:44,150
I choose yoga.

637
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,975
I pursue street dance.

638
00:21:46,228 --> 00:21:47,720
Not strip dance?

639
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:50,630
(Not strip dance?)

640
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,400
- No. - Is it strip dance?

641
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,600
Are you sure it's street dance?

642
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:55,500
Is it strip dance or street dance?

643
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:58,015
- Street. - Street?

644
00:21:58,073 --> 00:22:00,900
I don't even want to imagine Jae Seok strip-dancing.

645
00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:02,955
(They move to their mission spots.)

646
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:07,410
Flying yoga isn't going to be easy.

647
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,410
- It's very difficult. - Have you done it?

648
00:22:09,418 --> 00:22:11,050
- I've done it once. - Have you?

649
00:22:11,053 --> 00:22:12,220
- Yes. - Have you really?

650
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,920
- It's not that. - That's cheating.

651
00:22:13,922 --> 00:22:15,050
You're up-to-date.

652
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:17,220
I did it once for a show.

653
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:19,160
- How was it? - It was difficult.

654
00:22:19,161 --> 00:22:20,360
Physically?

655
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:22,190
You are hardened, aren't you?

656
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,490
(He gets playful.)

657
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:25,700
- I'm very inflexible. - A long time ago...

658
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:27,845
What do you mean that I'm hardened?

659
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,870
Stretching is difficult.

660
00:22:29,871 --> 00:22:31,300
At least you have muscles.

661
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:32,840
I worked out my legs yesterday.

662
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:35,310
Kwang Soo doesn't care about anything...

663
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,170
except seeing the yoga teacher.

664
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:38,940
(He came to see the yoga teacher.)

665
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:40,395
Okay.

666
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:41,410
That seems like it.

667
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,950
Is there a yoga teacher?

668
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:44,480
(He pretends not to know.)

669
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:45,980
Of course there is.

670
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:47,650
Why do you ask when you already know?

671
00:22:47,656 --> 00:22:50,090
There aren't many male yoga teachers.

672
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:52,190
- They're always female. - Generally,

673
00:22:52,194 --> 00:22:54,120
women teach yoga.

674
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:56,690
It won't be one of our guests...

675
00:22:56,698 --> 00:22:58,130
who's teaching, right?

676
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,830
The worst case would be Park Na Rae.

677
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,430
- That's what I thought too. - Me too.

678
00:23:01,436 --> 00:23:03,800
Na Rae taught pole dancing...

679
00:23:03,805 --> 00:23:05,440
- before. - Right.

680
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
During a shoot.

681
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:09,470
She taught us with a seductive look.

682
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:10,910
It was uncomfortable.

683
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:12,410
That would be uncomfortable.

684
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:13,825
Okay.

685
00:23:13,882 --> 00:23:15,580
We're here. What's that?

686
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:18,050
- Let's go. - Let's go.

687
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:20,420
(They must succeed and get a hint.)

688
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:23,420
When it comes to yoga, there's a teacher.

689
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,490
My heart is fluttering.

690
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,120
(Who will be their yoga teacher?)

691
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:28,630
- Seriously. - It's true.

692
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,160
- Wait a minute. - Is someone hiding?

693
00:23:30,165 --> 00:23:32,000
The teacher is hiding inside.

694
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
It's definitely Na Rae.

695
00:23:33,568 --> 00:23:36,170
Her knees are protruding.

696
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,400
- Look. - The toes look strong.

697
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,100
The toes are clearly visible.

698
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:41,870
There's a person inside.

699
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:43,470
I'm leaving if it's Na Rae.

700
00:23:43,478 --> 00:23:45,310
Na Rae isn't that tall.

701
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,040
- She's quite tall. - She is.

702
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,950
How long have you been in there?

703
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,310
She seems to be struggling. Shall we wait?

704
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:52,920
Is she shuddering?

705
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:54,420
Let her come out on her own.

706
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:56,420
- Who's there? - Are you the teacher?

707
00:23:56,425 --> 00:23:57,820
Are you our teacher for today?

708
00:23:57,826 --> 00:24:00,220
How can the teacher look so uncool?

709
00:24:00,228 --> 00:24:02,190
(Who could it be?)

710
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:03,230
(He expected the teacher to look cool.)

711
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:04,985
- Teacher? - What are you doing?

712
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:08,970
Peek-a-boo. Hello.

713
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,400
(They welcome her.)

714
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:12,400
- Hello. - It's Yu Seung Ok.

715
00:24:12,407 --> 00:24:14,100
- She's an actual teacher. - It's her.

716
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:16,895
- It's Yu Seung Ok. - Hello.

717
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:19,080
We get to see her in person.

718
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,625
(1 of the top 5 Asian bodybuilders, Yu Seung Ok)

719
00:24:20,682 --> 00:24:23,110
We invited Yu Seung Ok for today's yoga class.

720
00:24:23,118 --> 00:24:24,450
(It's nice to meet you.)

721
00:24:24,453 --> 00:24:25,765
It's an honor.

722
00:24:26,621 --> 00:24:29,050
I was going to stand near her. Why did you block me?

723
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:30,320
What do you mean?

724
00:24:30,325 --> 00:24:32,190
- He pushed my shoulder. - It happened naturally.

725
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:34,205
- He took my place. - It just happened.

726
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,630
(A few minutes ago while setting up the camera)

727
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,115
(Pushing)

728
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:41,870
(He blocked him from her.)

729
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,400
(Kwang Soo took his place next to the instructor.)

730
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:46,000
Are you blocking me?

731
00:24:46,007 --> 00:24:48,170
- Okay. - Seung Ok is tall.

732
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:51,155
They look good together.

733
00:24:51,246 --> 00:24:53,180
That's why you blocked me.

734
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,680
(They laugh shyly.)

735
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,310
No, you can stand here.

736
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,120
No, you can stand there.

737
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,480
He blocked me.

738
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:01,775
- How tall are you? - I'm 172cm.

739
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:03,190
172cm?

740
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:04,690
- How old are you? - She seems as tall as you.

741
00:25:04,693 --> 00:25:06,905
- I'm 29. - You're 29.

742
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,245
Our age difference is five years.

743
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:10,390
Really?

744
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,800
(Will they become a couple?)

745
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,100
Why do you ask that?

746
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:14,460
She has to introduce herself anyway.

747
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:15,870
She's our teacher.

748
00:25:15,871 --> 00:25:17,800
Now that I see you in person...

749
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:20,285
(She talks to Kwang Soo.)

750
00:25:20,308 --> 00:25:21,870
(Now that she sees him in person...)

751
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:26,610
(How do I look?)

752
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,350
You look very interesting.

753
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,180
(She's never seen a face like his.)

754
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:32,220
What about his face?

755
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,680
Doesn't he look like a cartoon character?

756
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,435
- His head... - I look interesting?

757
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:37,620
looks similar to that of a horse.

758
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:39,175
(His head seems like that of a horse.)

759
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:42,630
- I look like a horse? - No, he looks like a giraffe.

760
00:25:42,631 --> 00:25:44,330
(Be more accurate.)

761
00:25:44,332 --> 00:25:46,060
- He looks like a giraffe. - You know...

762
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:48,470
- His nose is long. - We just met. How can she say that?

763
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,230
- She's our teacher. - That's true.

764
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:53,440
- Okay. - She's our teacher, so just listen.

765
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:56,870
Seung Ok will explain the mission herself.

766
00:25:56,878 --> 00:26:00,410
Here's your flying yoga mission for today.

767
00:26:00,415 --> 00:26:02,650
Eight yoga positions of different levels...

768
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:06,320
are attached on the shoe throw board.

769
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:09,990
Each member throws their shoe and chooses a position.

770
00:26:09,991 --> 00:26:13,090
If all members hold the position of their choice successfully,

771
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:14,490
the mission is cleared.

772
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:18,175
Once it's cleared, you're given a hint on the final location.

773
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,960
- It's difficult. - We must win.

774
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,870
- We'll succeed. - Definitely.

775
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,300
How do we do a chandelier?

776
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:24,970
- What's its level of difficulty? - Isn't it difficult?

777
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:26,000
(That position...)

778
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:29,170
That position looks very good.

779
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:31,140
- What I mean is... - It's not about the looks.

780
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:33,340
- I don't have to look good. - We just have to do it.

781
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:34,950
- It's not about the looks. - I don't have to look good.

782
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,610
How difficult is it?

783
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,680
- It's easier than the Da Vinci. - Is it easy?

784
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,050
- Yes. - Let's try it.

785
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:41,180
Monkey looks difficult.

786
00:26:41,189 --> 00:26:43,050
Wouldn't you fall off if you have no bottom?

787
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,120
(By the way...)

788
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:46,460
(Kwang Soo will definitely fall off.)

789
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:48,330
- It has nothing to do with me. - If you have no bottom,

790
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,490
- It has nothing to do with me. - you'll fall.

791
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:51,090
- Kwang Soo is in trouble. - It has nothing to do with me.

792
00:26:51,099 --> 00:26:53,115
That's possible.

793
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:54,900
I won't fall.

794
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:57,300
Each member will throw their shoe.

795
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:58,400
Here we go.

796
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,200
We have to succeed within six hours.

797
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:02,970
- Try to pick the butterfly. - All right, I'll go for that.

798
00:27:02,978 --> 00:27:04,255
Butterfly?

799
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:05,440
There it goes.

800
00:27:05,447 --> 00:27:07,480
(Jong Kook isn't good at throwing his shoe.)

801
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:09,050
(He gets the chandelier that's harder than the butterfly.)

802
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,410
He got the chandelier.

803
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:11,580
You'll break your back.

804
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:12,980
His shoe fell on the chandelier.

805
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:14,220
- Okay. - In one go?

806
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,220
She got it.

807
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:16,920
(Ji Hyo gets the monkey.)

808
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,820
Monkey is very easy.

809
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,220
Get something easy.

810
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:21,830
(Se Chan gets the crocodile.)

811
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,090
- What is it? - Crocodile?

812
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,230
(He gets an easy one.)

813
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:25,960
- You got it. - It's easy.

814
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,100
It's the easiest one.

815
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:29,100
Get the easy one.

816
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:30,730
It's butterfly.

817
00:27:30,739 --> 00:27:33,300
- You got the butterfly. - Butterfly is good.

818
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:35,210
- I got the butterfly. - Butterfly is good.

819
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:37,170
- It's easy. - Based on your shoe throw,

820
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:40,340
you picked chandelier, monkey, crocodile,

821
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,750
- and butterfly. - That's great.

822
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,920
- Butterfly. - The positions are determined.

823
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,080
- You'll stretch with Seung Ok. - Before we start,

824
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:49,050
- we'll stretch. - Let's do that. It's important.

825
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,050
- It's important. - Sit down on the floor.

826
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,060
- Yes, we sit on the floor. - Okay.

827
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:55,690
- I should explain this first. - What is it?

828
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:58,230
(She almost forgot.)

829
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,645
- Were you confused? - No.

830
00:28:00,902 --> 00:28:02,100
You seemed confused.

831
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:05,470
- There are two points. - Yes.

832
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:08,200
Put an imaginary dot in the middle.

833
00:28:08,209 --> 00:28:09,470
An imaginary dot?

834
00:28:09,477 --> 00:28:11,680
Then extend it to the bottom.

835
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,440
This is called the plumb line.

836
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:15,180
- Pardon? - Plumb line.

837
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:17,650
- "Plumb line"? - Plumb line.

838
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,150
Sit along the plumb line.

839
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:21,690
- Sit down? - On the floor?

840
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,450
- Do we sit there? - Right in the middle?

841
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,960
No, go back a little.

842
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,190
If possible, try to keep the knees straight and pretty.

843
00:28:29,197 --> 00:28:31,490
(Keep the knees straight and pretty.)

844
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,500
Straighten the knees prettily.

845
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:35,785
Our teacher likes pretty things.

846
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:36,870
Like this?

847
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:39,125
(Do I look pretty?)

848
00:28:39,674 --> 00:28:40,740
(She's satisfied.)

849
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:45,180
With your knees straight, grab the hammock.

850
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,095
Turn your wrist to make a knot.

851
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:52,265
(Do we do it like this?)

852
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:54,220
She's good at teaching.

853
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:56,890
Imagine that a ghost is pulling up your torso...

854
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:59,220
from the top.

855
00:28:59,227 --> 00:29:01,590
(Seung Ok's special stretching)

856
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:03,160
As if a ghost is pulling us up?

857
00:29:03,164 --> 00:29:04,715
How does that feel?

858
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:07,660
- A ghost is pulling us up? - But why a ghost?

859
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,900
Imagine that I'm pulling you up, Kwang Soo.

860
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:12,470
- Okay. - Okay.

861
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:15,810
- Imagine that I'm pulling you. - Now I understand.

862
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,470
I understand now.

863
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:21,180
Toward the hand that's grabbing the knot,

864
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:23,495
stretch your body as far as possible.

865
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,920
Goodness.

866
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,480
- Like this? - Goodness.

867
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:28,735
(Stretching)

868
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:30,250
It's hard to do.

869
00:29:30,258 --> 00:29:31,650
You must trust it.

870
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:34,990
Trust the hammock and stretch to the side as much as possible.

871
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:38,015
It's hard to trust when you've been on Running Man for a long time.

872
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm sorry. It's an occupational disease.

873
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:43,330
Next is crossing the body.

874
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:46,140
- Cross? - Cross your feet.

875
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,400
(Cross your two feet.)

876
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:49,670
Put your right hand on the left side.

877
00:29:49,677 --> 00:29:54,580
(While crossing your feet, put the right hand on the left.)

878
00:29:54,582 --> 00:29:56,310
- Were you confused? - No.

879
00:29:56,317 --> 00:29:57,650
- I'm certain. - No.

880
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:00,865
Wait, I'm not the only one who thought she hesitated.

881
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:03,250
- I'm not the only one, right? - No, put it on your left.

882
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:04,320
(She's flustered.)

883
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:05,690
(I'm getting angry.)

884
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:08,860
- She made a sound. - Is she angry?

885
00:30:08,863 --> 00:30:10,175
Okay.

886
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:12,445
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

887
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:15,330
Put your right hand on the left.

888
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:18,900
Put your arm behind your head.

889
00:30:18,907 --> 00:30:21,000
- Behind? - Yes.

890
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:22,970
- We can turn? - Stretch the side of your body.

891
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:25,340
- Can you twist your body? - Stretch farther.

892
00:30:25,346 --> 00:30:28,765
- Wait, this is... - So that your body twists.

893
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:32,680
Is this correct, Seung Ok?

894
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:34,150
(It feels and looks strange. Is this correct?)

895
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:36,705
Yes, that's correct. And now...

896
00:30:37,158 --> 00:30:39,645
- You look like you're flying. - Is this right?

897
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:42,460
You look like a rocket. It's correct.

898
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,660
(The position is correct.)

899
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:46,630
Exhale.

900
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,445
- It feels good. - Okay.

901
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,300
This position feels very good.

902
00:30:51,306 --> 00:30:54,455
Come back to your original position.

903
00:30:54,676 --> 00:30:56,770
- Again. - What about the other side?

904
00:30:56,778 --> 00:30:59,980
- Now, take your elbow. - What about the other side?

905
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:01,310
(She continues without listening.)

906
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:04,410
- Take your elbow. - She just keeps going.

907
00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:06,680
- He asked you a question. - She should take a look at us.

908
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:09,705
She does it alone. She's satisfied on her own.

909
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:12,105
Put your elbow on the floor.

910
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:14,405
- Then... - She doesn't listen.

911
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,690
She doesn't listen to us.

912
00:31:16,698 --> 00:31:18,945
- She isn't listening. - Take a look at us.

913
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,060
What do we do about our legs?

914
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,930
I think my position is wrong.

915
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:24,670
- What should we do? - My hand hurts. What's wrong?

916
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,670
Tell us what we're doing wrong.

917
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:28,355
Don't the instructors usually fix our positions?

918
00:31:28,676 --> 00:31:30,470
Let's do the other side.

919
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:32,680
Right, we're finally doing the other side.

920
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,025
Push your body toward the hammock.

921
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,150
- Like this? - Yes.

922
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:38,580
(Is this correct again?)

923
00:31:38,586 --> 00:31:40,605
Is everyone correct?

924
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,775
Yes, that's right.

925
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,420
Don't look at me. Look toward the other side.

926
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:48,220
(Are you sure this is correct?)

927
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:51,375
I can't do it. Am I doing well?

928
00:31:51,699 --> 00:31:53,700
My position seems wrong. Am I doing well?

929
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:54,900
- It's correct. - Is it right?

930
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:56,470
No, it isn't.

931
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:57,800
(I'm sorry.)

932
00:31:57,805 --> 00:31:59,500
Can you tell me what's wrong?

933
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,740
Tell us if we're doing something wrong.

934
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,310
Are you feeling lazy?

935
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:04,595
(Suspicious)

936
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,640
- You look like a mermaid. - Me?

937
00:32:06,648 --> 00:32:08,095
Yes.

938
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,610
(She finally fixes their positions.)

939
00:32:09,617 --> 00:32:11,650
- A bit more... - Oh, my.

940
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:13,435
Oh, my.

941
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:14,920
There you go.

942
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:17,650
Try to stretch your side.

943
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:19,660
Jong Kook is doing very well.

944
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:21,205
I am? Thank you.

945
00:32:21,396 --> 00:32:23,930
My side is stretching so much.

946
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:25,060
(The teacher goes back.)

947
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,130
- Seung Ok. - Yes?

948
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:27,900
Am I invisible to you?

949
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,530
(Why do you just pass me by?)

950
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:31,900
Why do you skip me?

951
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:33,485
I didn't mean to.

952
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:36,340
(Seung Ok tries to console him.)

953
00:32:36,344 --> 00:32:37,410
Is your arm too long?

954
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:38,580
(Kwang Soo receives a private lesson too.)

955
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,925
Is your arm too long?

956
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:41,580
Am I doing it right?

957
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:44,580
(He becomes suspicious again.)

958
00:32:44,586 --> 00:32:46,035
Am I doing it right?

959
00:32:46,054 --> 00:32:48,690
(It's obvious that he's not doing it right.)

960
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,935
(He looks so interesting.)

961
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:52,605
Is this right?

962
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,260
Why?

963
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:59,100
(Why aren't you saying anything? Is this wrong?)

964
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,600
He's weird.

965
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:02,000
This guy is a bit weird.

966
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:03,400
(He's not just interesting anymore.)

967
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:04,900
I'm not weird.

968
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:06,500
How can you...

969
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:08,840
- Fix his position. - I'm following your instruction.

970
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,010
I need to focus.

971
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:11,955
(He's not weird.)

972
00:33:13,047 --> 00:33:14,640
Is it normal that I can't breathe?

973
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:16,150
I need to focus.

974
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:19,180
- Is it normal that I can't breathe? - Stay there.

975
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:20,635
Right hand...

976
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:22,335
And then...

977
00:33:22,857 --> 00:33:26,360
(Glancing)

978
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,445
Are you copying us?

979
00:33:28,663 --> 00:33:31,060
- Why are you copying us? - Why are you looking at us?

980
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:32,685
- Seung Ok. - Seung Ok.

981
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:33,960
Hold on.

982
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:35,600
She did it wrong.

983
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,530
- Goodness. - Why are you copying us?

984
00:33:37,538 --> 00:33:38,955
I did it wrong.

985
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,585
And then...

986
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:42,655
- She was confused? - Are we moving on?

987
00:33:43,144 --> 00:33:45,010
Put your elbow down...

988
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:47,025
- Oh, this one... - This one is okay.

989
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,110
Are we skipping the other one?

990
00:33:49,117 --> 00:33:50,250
We just did it.

991
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,250
What? We didn't.

992
00:33:52,253 --> 00:33:53,935
We didn't do this one.

993
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:55,690
We skipped this one.

994
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,920
We did it.

995
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,445
(She's not listening.)

996
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,490
- We didn't! - We didn't!

997
00:34:01,496 --> 00:34:03,645
We know we didn't!

998
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,330
We did it? We didn't!

999
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:07,945
We skipped it!

1000
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:09,570
So what's your plan?

1001
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,200
(Kwang Soo talks casually.)

1002
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:13,870
Why do you talk that way to our teacher?

1003
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:16,155
- What are you doing? - Give me a second.

1004
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:19,180
We're done. Please get up.

1005
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,925
(She doesn't listen to anyone.)

1006
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,795
We're done?

1007
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:24,310
We're getting up? We're done?

1008
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,720
(So suddenly?)

1009
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,765
Hold on. What's with her?

1010
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:29,850
- We want an expert. - Seriously...

1011
00:34:29,857 --> 00:34:32,135
Trust me. I'll focus from now on.

1012
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:33,860
You weren't focusing before?

1013
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:35,090
You weren't?

1014
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:36,760
Are we done stretching?

1015
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:40,400
(Will the yoga class go all right?)

1016
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:41,560
There's a dance studio here.

1017
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,330
It looks nice. I didn't know it was here.

1018
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:44,630
Street dance.

1019
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,385
Dance, dance, dance.

1020
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:47,900
Oh, my.

1021
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,195
(Who is our teacher?)

1022
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:54,180
(Who are today's dance teachers?)

1023
00:34:54,182 --> 00:34:55,950
- Hello. - Mmary.

1024
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:58,495
J-black. J-pink.

1025
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,935
(Mmary is the most popular dance queen these days.)

1026
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:06,820
(Every dancer has heard of J-black.)

1027
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:09,190
- Hello. - I'm your huge fan.

1028
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:11,630
- Hi. - He dances in high heels, right?

1029
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,585
- Hi. - Right?

1030
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,470
He's incredible.

1031
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,570
He is.

1032
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:19,740
You two shot a hamburger commercial, right?

1033
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:21,885
Yes. The one where she flies.

1034
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:25,010
(These two soulful dancers...)

1035
00:35:25,012 --> 00:35:26,740
(turned into a human hamburger in the commercial.)

1036
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,680
Yes. The one where she flies.

1037
00:35:28,683 --> 00:35:30,110
They run a hamburger store?

1038
00:35:30,118 --> 00:35:31,810
(Hold on.)

1039
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,365
They shot a commercial.

1040
00:35:33,588 --> 00:35:35,220
- I'm just joking. - You see it very often.

1041
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,950
- I'm just joking. - His jokes are weird.

1042
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:37,990
Seriously...

1043
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,360
By the way, J-black is good at fighting.

1044
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:41,705
What?

1045
00:35:41,863 --> 00:35:43,130
I'm pretty good too.

1046
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:46,315
(Is that so?)

1047
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:49,430
I'm pretty good.

1048
00:35:49,437 --> 00:35:51,730
Why are these two here?

1049
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:53,670
Please explain.

1050
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:54,840
Today,

1051
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:58,010
you'll learn to street-dance...

1052
00:35:58,012 --> 00:35:59,340
to a one-minute-long song.

1053
00:35:59,347 --> 00:36:00,640
You'll give a performance too.

1054
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:01,880
- Where? - Where?

1055
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,595
We'll give a performance? That's a problem.

1056
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,480
- We're doomed. - We're doomed.

1057
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:07,720
There's a condition.

1058
00:36:07,722 --> 00:36:10,250
You have to get every move right.

1059
00:36:10,258 --> 00:36:13,320
(Things get worse and worse.)

1060
00:36:13,327 --> 00:36:14,860
If you succeed,

1061
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:17,190
you'll receive a hint about the delivery place.

1062
00:36:17,198 --> 00:36:18,630
I don't think we'll succeed.

1063
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,300
- It's too difficult. - It's too difficult.

1064
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:21,730
We'll fail.

1065
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:23,070
- What should we do? - What should we do?

1066
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,430
I don't think we can do it.

1067
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:26,400
(Will they be able to win a hint?)

1068
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,600
Where's our briefcase?

1069
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,740
- Where's our briefcase? - Keep an eye on it.

1070
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:31,870
Our briefcase.

1071
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:34,180
- Why didn't you bring it here? - Our briefcase...

1072
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:35,950
Hold on. Let me go find it.

1073
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,180
This is why you shouldn't have left it with me.

1074
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:40,080
(Seok Jin lost the briefcase again?)

1075
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,450
Gosh. Our briefcase...

1076
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:42,950
(Seok Jin lost the briefcase again?)

1077
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:44,850
I completely forgot about it too.

1078
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:46,020
Me too.

1079
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:48,020
- Our briefcase... - I completely forgot.

1080
00:36:48,029 --> 00:36:49,160
It should be here.

1081
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,645
(He returns to the previous location.)

1082
00:36:51,966 --> 00:36:53,060
It's there.

1083
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,815
(Relieved)

1084
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,755
It's left right here.

1085
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:59,455
I haven't even danced yet, and I'm already tired.

1086
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:00,740
(He uses all his energy to find the briefcase.)

1087
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:03,570
If we lose the briefcase, there's no point in shooting this.

1088
00:37:03,578 --> 00:37:04,895
Guys.

1089
00:37:05,179 --> 00:37:06,280
- Did you find it? - What a relief.

1090
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,740
You shouldn't have left it with me.

1091
00:37:07,748 --> 00:37:09,810
Don't lose it again.

1092
00:37:09,817 --> 00:37:10,910
Don't you remember?

1093
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,980
I even lost my baby on his first birthday.

1094
00:37:12,987 --> 00:37:15,135
(Don't you remember?)

1095
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,420
- On his first birthday. - It's true.

1096
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:19,545
It could have been bad.

1097
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:22,120
- All right. - This is our mission.

1098
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:23,790
Please don't make it too hard.

1099
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:25,960
- Please consider our skills. - Don't worry.

1100
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:27,400
(What kind of dance will they learn?)

1101
00:37:27,401 --> 00:37:29,455
We're complete beginners.

1102
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:34,700
(It's a famous song.)

1103
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,270
This song is too good for us.

1104
00:37:36,277 --> 00:37:37,870
We couldn't dance to this.

1105
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:40,780
(Mission Song: "Treasure" by Bruno Mars)

1106
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:43,310
(The two teachers start to warm up.)

1107
00:37:43,317 --> 00:37:44,695
Look at her face.

1108
00:37:45,453 --> 00:37:48,065
(Are you ready, honey?)

1109
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,350
We can't do that.

1110
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,820
(Part 1: Powerful beats and waves)

1111
00:37:52,827 --> 00:37:54,405
We can't do that.

1112
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:56,415
I can't do the waves.

1113
00:37:57,131 --> 00:37:59,130
(Sassy)

1114
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,460
Look at her face.

1115
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:01,560
She looks so relaxed.

1116
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:04,115
(Even their facial expressions are phenomenal.)

1117
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:07,740
We can't...

1118
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:10,010
(Part 2: Quick steps and couple dance)

1119
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:12,395
(Fancy)

1120
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:15,950
- We can't do that. - How are we going to do that?

1121
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,510
We can't do that.

1122
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,950
(Part 2 looks more difficult than Part 1.)

1123
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:22,635
(In addition to the quick steps, they have to act too.)

1124
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,260
We can never do that.

1125
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:31,430
(Part 3: The male dancer's difficult, solo dance)

1126
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,845
(Relaxed)

1127
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:37,515
- I mean... - We can never do that.

1128
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,070
It's too fast.

1129
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:41,070
- Are you kidding us? - We can't do that.

1130
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:42,385
We can't...

1131
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:45,270
This is what only pop singers can do.

1132
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,440
(Part 4: Making circles)

1133
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:48,895
What is this?

1134
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,780
I can't believe it.

1135
00:38:50,785 --> 00:38:54,320
(Good job, my treasure.)

1136
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:55,480
(The couple's acting plays an important part.)

1137
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:56,650
It's what suits the teachers' levels.

1138
00:38:56,657 --> 00:38:58,220
Even the facial expressions are hard.

1139
00:38:58,225 --> 00:39:00,160
- You're just bragging, aren't you? - Exactly.

1140
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:03,590
(The demonstration is over.)

1141
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:06,300
This is...

1142
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,360
How are we going to do this?

1143
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:09,630
- I'm more worried about... - It's too difficult.

1144
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:11,585
your facial expressions than the moves.

1145
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:13,240
Just by imagining it...

1146
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,400
(You can already picture Jae Seok's facial expressions.)

1147
00:39:15,409 --> 00:39:16,770
It'll be terrible.

1148
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:19,180
We can never do this.

1149
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,780
It might look difficult now,

1150
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:22,550
- but it's easier than you think. - I don't think so.

1151
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,710
- You can do it. - No.

1152
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:26,820
To speed things up...

1153
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:28,220
- You want to know our levels. - Yes.

1154
00:39:28,222 --> 00:39:30,850
- If you show us, we'll adjust. - Okay.

1155
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:33,045
We want each of you to dance briefly.

1156
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,520
- Let's do it briefly. - I'm not good at these things.

1157
00:39:35,529 --> 00:39:36,690
You'll dance one by one.

1158
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:38,745
Let us warm up first.

1159
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,015
What are you talking about?

1160
00:39:42,203 --> 00:39:44,115
Gosh.

1161
00:39:44,238 --> 00:39:45,985
I'm getting competitive.

1162
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:48,240
- Let's start. - Let's just start right away.

1163
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:49,340
(How good are they?)

1164
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,610
We should get into the rhythm.

1165
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:52,680
I'm so embarrassed.

1166
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,065
We don't usually dance to this kind of songs.

1167
00:39:56,717 --> 00:39:59,320
- Haha is a good dancer. - Haha. There you go.

1168
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,280
(The ace, Haha, goes first.)

1169
00:40:01,288 --> 00:40:02,775
That's so cool!

1170
00:40:04,091 --> 00:40:05,320
Gosh.

1171
00:40:05,326 --> 00:40:06,360
He's good.

1172
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,905
He's so cool.

1173
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,475
Gosh. I wish I could dance like him.

1174
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:12,900
He's so good.

1175
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,900
(Sexy)

1176
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,330
(Haha is challenging the teachers.)

1177
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:19,240
This wasn't embarrassing.

1178
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,670
So Min. She's good too.

1179
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:23,125
So Min is good.

1180
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:27,880
(Bouncing)

1181
00:40:27,882 --> 00:40:29,180
Here it comes.

1182
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:31,710
(She shows off her charms.)

1183
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:32,980
She's so cute.

1184
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,950
- So Min is good. - So Min is good.

1185
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:36,935
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

1186
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:42,790
(Wriggling)

1187
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:44,930
(That's getting too old.)

1188
00:40:44,932 --> 00:40:48,300
There's something he does when he's desperate.

1189
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:49,730
(His specialty)

1190
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:50,970
Stop it!

1191
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:52,070
(The teachers now know.)

1192
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,100
Oh, my.

1195
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,870
(Seok Jin is the last one.)

1196
00:40:57,878 --> 00:41:00,180
He has his own style.

1197
00:41:00,181 --> 00:41:01,965
(They're looking forward.)

1198
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:04,950
Here it comes.

1199
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:06,365
That's Lim Ha Ryong.

1200
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:08,080
(His dance is old-fashioned.)

1201
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:09,850
- Lim Ha Ryong. - Ricky Martin.

1202
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:10,950
(Worried)

1203
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:12,520
His dance is...

1204
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:13,860
Go right.

1205
00:41:13,861 --> 00:41:15,420
(I'm doing well, right?)

1206
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:16,815
Go left.

1207
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:19,060
That's all we can show you.

1208
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,460
- But seriously, - yes?

1209
00:41:21,469 --> 00:41:22,970
your sense of rhythm...

1210
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,330
- You all have it. - You all have it.

1211
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:25,885
We can do that much.

1212
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:28,970
What are you talking about?

1213
00:41:28,976 --> 00:41:30,110
We can do that much.

1214
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,740
(Shameless)

1215
00:41:31,746 --> 00:41:33,180
We can do that much.

1216
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,225
We have a sense of rhythm.

1217
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,380
- That's all you need. - We do.

1218
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:38,650
You can definitely do it.

1219
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,105
We'll make the dance a bit easier.

1220
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:42,850
I think we can do that.

1221
00:41:42,857 --> 00:41:44,720
- It'd be a miracle. - You'll be surprised.

1222
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:46,160
1 of you 3...

1223
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,360
- should be a woman. - A woman.

1224
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:49,130
I think these guys...

1225
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,190
1 of the 3 men should play the female role.

1226
00:41:51,198 --> 00:41:55,060
The men's part is a lot more difficult.

1227
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:56,230
So I think...

1228
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:57,755
(The teacher has an idea.)

1229
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,340
Jae Seok and Haha should do the men's part.

1230
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:03,270
- Us? - Because you have experience.

1231
00:42:03,277 --> 00:42:05,555
- You'll be a woman then. - What?

1232
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:07,880
No way.

1233
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:09,665
I don't like him already.

1234
00:42:09,683 --> 00:42:12,410
- It'll be terrible. - You'll do it.

1235
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:14,320
Can we learn it quickly?

1236
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:16,090
- I can't do it. - I know.

1237
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,090
Seriously.

1238
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:18,490
I'll make magic happen.

1239
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,020
Magic? Okay, let's give it a try.

1240
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:22,120
(Their official lesson starts.)

1241
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:23,930
Let's take it slow and start.

1242
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,290
Relax your arm...

1243
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:29,230
and hit the side three times.

1244
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:31,230
Slowly. 7, 8.

1245
00:42:31,238 --> 00:42:33,985
(They break the beat first.)

1246
00:42:34,008 --> 00:42:35,855
That's right. You just did it.

1247
00:42:36,177 --> 00:42:40,440
(The two women...)

1248
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:42,380
(as well as the two men are doing a good job.)

1249
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:45,650
That's right. Now, you called it a wave,

1250
00:42:45,653 --> 00:42:47,820
but you're just making it look like a wave.

1251
00:42:47,822 --> 00:42:48,850
(Seok Jin isn't good at waves.)

1252
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:49,990
Here,

1253
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:53,905
pull the arm toward you and lean back.

1254
00:42:54,128 --> 00:42:57,715
Lower your body, and that makes one wave.

1255
00:42:57,798 --> 00:43:00,085
How did he do it? I can't do it consecutively.

1256
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:02,160
Let's try it slowly.

1257
00:43:02,169 --> 00:43:04,300
From the top, seven, go.

1258
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:08,100
(Number 1, hit the beat)

1259
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:11,740
(Number 2, wave)

1260
00:43:11,745 --> 00:43:14,010
Then turn around.

1261
00:43:14,014 --> 00:43:16,910
- You have a good sense of rhythm. - You're very good.

1262
00:43:16,917 --> 00:43:18,450
Let's say that you turned around.

1263
00:43:18,452 --> 00:43:20,420
- Are you teasing us? - Seriously?

1264
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:21,450
They're both teasing us.

1265
00:43:21,455 --> 00:43:23,250
You dance very well.

1266
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,005
- You're good. - You really are.

1267
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:28,020
How about this?

1268
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:31,760
We also prepared movements that are easier.

1269
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:35,060
You can do this part, so let's keep it.

1270
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:36,815
- I can't do it. - Then...

1271
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:38,215
turn around.

1272
00:43:38,672 --> 00:43:40,625
Come back to where you were and jump.

1273
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:41,970
Okay.

1274
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:45,195
(He keeps the transition simple.)

1275
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:47,180
That's great.

1276
00:43:47,181 --> 00:43:48,780
Yes, that's good.

1277
00:43:48,782 --> 00:43:50,965
Please make it simple.

1278
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:53,265
He has easy moves for people who aren't good.

1279
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,880
This is the woman's part.

1280
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:56,220
I have to learn the man's part.

1281
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,490
- You're a woman. - You're a woman, So Min.

1282
00:43:57,491 --> 00:43:58,720
You're a woman, aren't you?

1283
00:43:58,726 --> 00:44:00,160
(Aren't you a woman?)

1284
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
- You're a woman. - Am I?

1285
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:03,930
The two of you are women.

1286
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:05,430
- Me and Seok Jin? - Yes.

1287
00:44:05,432 --> 00:44:07,245
- Yes, we are women. - Both of you are women.

1288
00:44:07,434 --> 00:44:10,200
So Min, you're the most popular here.

1289
00:44:10,204 --> 00:44:11,430
(You're more popular than him.)

1290
00:44:11,438 --> 00:44:13,000
- Everyone wants to dance with you. - All of you are married.

1291
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:14,740
- All of them are married. - The women's part is...

1292
00:44:14,742 --> 00:44:16,470
(He's jealous of So Min.)

1293
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:19,880
Here's the woman's part. After the jump,

1294
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,165
turn away from your partner and act like a prude.

1295
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:25,995
Then look at the male partner.

1296
00:44:26,654 --> 00:44:28,080
Act like a prude.

1297
00:44:28,088 --> 00:44:29,750
Then look at the male partner.

1298
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:32,990
I've never been a prude.

1299
00:44:32,993 --> 00:44:34,860
I hate imagining Seok Jin as a prude.

1300
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:37,090
- I've never been a prude. - I don't want to do this.

1301
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:38,430
You complain a lot.

1302
00:44:38,432 --> 00:44:40,530
I've never been a prude in my life.

1303
00:44:40,534 --> 00:44:42,060
Just do it. You have to learn it.

1304
00:44:42,069 --> 00:44:44,300
- Start from the top, 7, 8. - 8.

1305
00:44:44,305 --> 00:44:45,685
(They repeat.)

1306
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:49,370
(Act like a prude after the beat and do a wave.)

1307
00:44:49,376 --> 00:44:51,770
1, 2, 3, jump.

1308
00:44:51,779 --> 00:44:54,795
- Turn away and look at the partner. - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1309
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:56,880
Turn away and look at the partner.

1310
00:44:56,884 --> 00:44:58,050
(He follows the instructor.)

1311
00:44:58,052 --> 00:44:59,880
- What? - Let's repeat the step.

1312
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:03,820
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3. It's three steps each.

1313
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:05,590
(Quick-step couple dance)

1314
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:06,720
It goes like this.

1315
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:09,590
(The second part becomes harder.)

1316
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:13,345
- No, we can't do it so quickly. - We can't do it.

1317
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:16,300
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.

1318
00:45:16,303 --> 00:45:18,070
- This is good enough. - That's the woman's part.

1319
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,340
That's the woman's part.

1320
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,500
The men's part is different.

1321
00:45:20,507 --> 00:45:21,900
What's the original dance?

1322
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:23,110
Originally...

1323
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,670
(They move quickly.)

1324
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:26,380
Then the man sits down.

1325
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,725
Can you do it slowly?

1326
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:30,780
Goodness.

1327
00:45:30,784 --> 00:45:32,650
This is when you sit down.

1328
00:45:32,653 --> 00:45:35,450
You're starting to show off again.

1329
00:45:35,456 --> 00:45:38,090
(You're starting to show off again.)

1330
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:41,205
You're showing off now that you can do it.

1331
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:43,675
You can't stay in the back, can you?

1332
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:45,130
There you go again.

1333
00:45:45,132 --> 00:45:47,560
You come to the front to show off.

1334
00:45:47,568 --> 00:45:48,960
- Right. - Slowly.

1335
00:45:48,969 --> 00:45:50,700
(His swag is exploding.)

1336
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:53,000
- There he goes again. - Okay.

1337
00:45:53,007 --> 00:45:55,970
- This is why he shouldn't be here. - He can't do that.

1338
00:45:55,976 --> 00:45:57,370
I love it.

1339
00:45:57,378 --> 00:45:58,370
He's so annoying.

1340
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:00,240
We need Ji Hyo here.

1341
00:46:00,247 --> 00:46:02,380
He's really annoying.

1342
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:03,710
He's starting to show off again.

1343
00:46:03,717 --> 00:46:05,280
Watch me for the woman's part.

1344
00:46:05,285 --> 00:46:07,820
This part is key.

1345
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:09,050
This is important.

1346
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:12,650
You have to move the hips lightly.

1347
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:16,530
Move the hips and make it look pretty.

1348
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,860
- This is so terrible. - That's correct.

1349
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:19,660
I almost kicked him.

1350
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,985
(I almost kicked him.)

1351
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:24,185
Can we kick someone once?

1352
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:26,340
- Just once. - Can we kick someone once?

1353
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,570
Please allow us to do that.

1354
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:29,270
- Let us kick each other just once. - Just once.

1355
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:30,840
- Right here. - We get one kick.

1356
00:46:30,844 --> 00:46:33,010
- We get to kick someone once. - Kick someone who's annoying.

1357
00:46:33,013 --> 00:46:34,040
Just once.

1358
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:35,280
- Let's do it. - Promise...

1359
00:46:35,282 --> 00:46:36,710
- Everyone gets a turn. - that you won't get upset.

1360
00:46:36,717 --> 00:46:38,550
- Kick someone who's annoying. - Seriously.

1361
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:39,650
1, 2, 3.

1362
00:46:39,653 --> 00:46:41,165
We can kick someone once.

1363
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:44,150
After this,

1364
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:46,520
take one more step forward...

1365
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,620
- and wait. - You approach...

1366
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,160
- and grab the shoulder. - When he grabs your shoulder,

1367
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:51,045
push him off like this.

1368
00:46:51,498 --> 00:46:53,045
Gosh.

1369
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
Gosh.

1370
00:46:54,401 --> 00:46:56,070
She's acting irritated even though she likes it.

1371
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,185
- Come on, you like it. - Gosh.

1372
00:46:58,205 --> 00:46:59,840
"Come on, you like it."

1373
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,885
(He gets into it immediately.)

1374
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,280
You and I would make a good pair.

1375
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,840
Gosh, come on.

1376
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:10,435
(He gets too into it.)

1377
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:13,720
(Kicking)

1378
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,650
Gosh, that hurt.

1379
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:18,135
- You kicked once. - He took his turn.

1380
00:47:18,492 --> 00:47:20,720
(One kick allows people to release their anger.)

1381
00:47:20,727 --> 00:47:22,120
He was so annoying.

1382
00:47:22,129 --> 00:47:23,130
In this part...

1383
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,130
(It's the third part.)

1384
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:25,130
the music goes like this.

1385
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:26,400
Then...

1386
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,300
drag your opposite leg.

1387
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:31,115
Take three steps.

1388
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:33,570
- He looks good doing it. - The women's part is the same.

1389
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:35,570
- It's the same. - Did you hurt your leg?

1390
00:47:35,576 --> 00:47:37,655
(Did you hurt your leg?)

1391
00:47:37,778 --> 00:47:38,870
(What do you mean?)

1392
00:47:38,879 --> 00:47:39,880
Did you hurt your leg?

1393
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,440
I'm dancing right now.

1394
00:47:41,448 --> 00:47:43,550
I thought you were bleeding.

1395
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:45,980
(He was only doing what he learned.)

1396
00:47:45,986 --> 00:47:48,220
- Seriously. - Let's change his foot.

1397
00:47:48,222 --> 00:47:51,150
I thought his right foot was bleeding.

1398
00:47:51,158 --> 00:47:52,920
(The one without any injured leg...)

1399
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:55,405
- In this part... - I'm good at this move.

1400
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:56,490
Dragging the foot.

1401
00:47:56,497 --> 00:47:58,530
- Haha looks amazing. - No way.

1402
00:47:58,532 --> 00:48:00,130
- He does. - He's detailed.

1403
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:01,745
- No. - You're amazing.

1404
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:05,570
(Am I that amazing?)

1405
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:07,355
Look at the hat.

1406
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:09,740
(When he wears his hat differently...)

1407
00:48:09,743 --> 00:48:11,895
Whenever I praise him, he wears his hat like that.

1408
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:15,110
He failed when he tried to copy H.O.T.

1409
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,235
- Then he failed. - That's right.

1410
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:19,580
He failed when he tried to copy H.O.T.

1411
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:20,865
(It's a sad memory.)

1412
00:48:21,588 --> 00:48:24,990
(He tried to copy H.O.T.)

1413
00:48:24,992 --> 00:48:28,520
(He goes out of the frame in 1 second.)

1414
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:33,985
(It's a sad story.)

1415
00:48:34,668 --> 00:48:35,930
That's what you do.

1416
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:38,330
(That's what happens to people who show off.)

1417
00:48:38,338 --> 00:48:39,330
(He's crying.)

1418
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:40,755
The dance is amazing.

1419
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:42,555
I can't do it anymore.

1420
00:48:42,776 --> 00:48:44,170
Dance it your way.

1421
00:48:44,178 --> 00:48:45,370
That's what I like.

1422
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:46,665
(Will they clear their dance mission?)

1423
00:48:47,548 --> 00:48:49,010
This is the real flying yoga.

1424
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:50,280
(How is the yoga team doing?)

1425
00:48:50,284 --> 00:48:53,580
Put your right ankle on the hammock.

1426
00:48:53,587 --> 00:48:55,850
Then lean forward.

1427
00:48:55,856 --> 00:48:58,435
Keep the left heel on the ground.

1428
00:48:58,926 --> 00:49:01,820
(They follow the instructions without a problem.)

1429
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:03,430
Wait a minute.

1430
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:05,915
Wait a minute. It hurts a lot.

1431
00:49:06,567 --> 00:49:08,700
(He can't understand them.)

1432
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:10,400
Push, instead of pulling.

1433
00:49:10,404 --> 00:49:11,855
- Push? - Yes.

1434
00:49:12,339 --> 00:49:13,500
(She pushes slightly.)

1435
00:49:13,507 --> 00:49:15,285
(He spins.)

1436
00:49:16,276 --> 00:49:18,840
(He spins in the air.)

1437
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:19,840
(This isn't right.)

1438
00:49:19,846 --> 00:49:21,180
I don't think this is right.

1439
00:49:21,181 --> 00:49:22,725
(He spins the other way.)

1440
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:25,550
(Is this really correct?)

1441
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:28,550
- No, you shouldn't spin. - Okay.

1442
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:30,775
What do you mean you don't think it's right?

1443
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:32,505
I must concentrate.

1444
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:35,420
Put it on the hammock and keep the knee straight.

1445
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:36,815
(She concentrates and teaches him again.)

1446
00:49:37,197 --> 00:49:38,890
Hold your pelvis still.

1447
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:40,130
Lean forward.

1448
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:41,530
Go forward.

1449
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,070
(Why isn't it working?)

1450
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,570
He can't do it.

1451
00:49:44,571 --> 00:49:46,100
What are they doing?

1452
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:47,240
What are you doing?

1453
00:49:47,241 --> 00:49:48,240
(It's a passionate and dynamic turn.)

1454
00:49:48,242 --> 00:49:50,770
(A teacher inexperienced with variety shows and her student...)

1455
00:49:50,777 --> 00:49:54,780
(have a passionate and thrilling connection.)

1456
00:49:54,781 --> 00:49:56,010
What are you doing?

1457
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:58,380
Are you dating or something?

1458
00:49:58,385 --> 00:49:59,965
What are you doing?

1459
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,550
(It's not what you think it is.)

1460
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:04,350
- I give up on you. - I can't do it.

1461
00:50:04,358 --> 00:50:06,105
Do you give up on me?

1462
00:50:06,526 --> 00:50:09,290
(She gives up after trying once.)

1463
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:10,760
Teach him how to do it.

1464
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:11,790
What?

1465
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:14,315
How can she give up on her student so easily?

1466
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,330
I can't do it.

1467
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,200
How can she give up after 1 or 2 attempts?

1468
00:50:18,205 --> 00:50:19,330
That's right.

1469
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:20,740
Ji Hyo is good.

1470
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:21,840
You're flexible, Ji Hyo.

1471
00:50:21,842 --> 00:50:24,170
If it's possible for you,

1472
00:50:24,177 --> 00:50:25,870
- take the heel off the ground. - Like this?

1473
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:27,325
Is that better?

1474
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:29,040
You look good together.

1475
00:50:29,049 --> 00:50:30,310
- Like this? - Yes.

1476
00:50:30,317 --> 00:50:31,710
Thank you.

1477
00:50:31,718 --> 00:50:33,220
- Now... - Shall we do the other side?

1478
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,580
- Are we doing the other side? - Are we?

1479
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:36,350
Lean forward.

1480
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:38,150
(Put the other ankle on the hammock and push forward.)

1481
00:50:38,158 --> 00:50:40,145
If it's possible for you...

1482
00:50:41,261 --> 00:50:43,930
(He turns the other way.)

1483
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,960
- I can't do it. - What's going on?

1484
00:50:45,966 --> 00:50:47,585
- It's strange. - I keep turning.

1485
00:50:48,368 --> 00:50:49,530
It's very strange.

1486
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:50,970
(What's the problem?)

1487
00:50:50,971 --> 00:50:52,400
Is the ceiling too high?

1488
00:50:52,406 --> 00:50:54,285
- I know why. - Why?

1489
00:50:54,474 --> 00:50:56,025
It needs to be higher.

1490
00:50:56,743 --> 00:50:58,270
(He tries again with the hammock higher.)

1491
00:50:58,278 --> 00:50:59,940
Keep your feet strong.

1492
00:50:59,946 --> 00:51:02,610
It feels really good.

1493
00:51:02,616 --> 00:51:04,780
Don't go to the side. Push forward.

1494
00:51:04,785 --> 00:51:06,605
(Turning)

1495
00:51:06,987 --> 00:51:08,650
(His body keeps turning.)

1496
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:11,135
Hey, what are you doing?

1497
00:51:11,491 --> 00:51:13,420
- What are you two doing? - Of course I turn.

1498
00:51:13,427 --> 00:51:15,920
Pulling the hammock makes me turn.

1499
00:51:15,929 --> 00:51:18,430
No, your body is strange.

1500
00:51:18,432 --> 00:51:19,760
(It's not my fault.)

1501
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:20,930
My body is strange?

1502
00:51:20,934 --> 00:51:22,800
What do you mean?

1503
00:51:22,803 --> 00:51:24,030
Seriously.

1504
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:25,915
Your body is strange indeed.

1505
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:28,470
- My body is strange? - You're hurting his feelings.

1506
00:51:28,475 --> 00:51:31,170
The teacher is hurting his feelings.

1507
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:33,340
Can you teach him?

1508
00:51:33,347 --> 00:51:34,880
- Him? - Where are you going?

1509
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:37,810
Teach him? His body is strange.

1510
00:51:37,818 --> 00:51:39,465
Put your leg on it.

1511
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:42,835
Put your ankle on the hammock. That's right.

1512
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:47,145
Keep the leg straight.

1513
00:51:47,227 --> 00:51:48,720
Hold still.

1514
00:51:48,729 --> 00:51:51,390
Straighten the leg and push forward.

1515
00:51:51,398 --> 00:51:53,130
Go straight.

1516
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:55,345
That's right. Go straight.

1517
00:51:55,836 --> 00:51:57,970
(What's going on?)

1518
00:51:57,971 --> 00:52:00,470
- Does it work or not? - It works because you force me.

1519
00:52:00,474 --> 00:52:03,610
(It's the power of teaching by force.)

1520
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,240
(Even his strange body becomes the ideal body.)

1521
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:08,225
Let go. Please let go of me.

1522
00:52:08,348 --> 00:52:10,235
Let go of my left side.

1523
00:52:10,283 --> 00:52:12,150
Let go of my left side.

1524
00:52:12,152 --> 00:52:14,320
- Jong Kook! Ouch, it hurts. - You have to do this.

1525
00:52:14,321 --> 00:52:16,350
- It works, right? - It works.

1526
00:52:16,356 --> 00:52:17,835
- That's right. - It works.

1527
00:52:18,358 --> 00:52:20,645
A teacher needs strength.

1528
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,320
He can do it.

1529
00:52:22,329 --> 00:52:23,430
(His mind and body are bruised.)

1530
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,790
Good. The stretching is done.

1531
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:26,800
Okay.

1532
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,200
(After many accidents, the stretching is finally done.)

1533
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:30,330
It works. It's refreshing.

1534
00:52:30,337 --> 00:52:32,700
- It's refreshing, right? - I am sweating.

1535
00:52:32,706 --> 00:52:34,070
It's refreshing.

1536
00:52:34,074 --> 00:52:37,240
Now, I will teach you...

1537
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:39,725
- the crocodile pose. - Okay.

1538
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,940
- It's the easiest pose, right? - Yes.

1539
00:52:41,948 --> 00:52:43,810
- Let's put one leg on the hammock. - All right.

1540
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:45,195
(They must complete the 4 poses to receive a hint.)

1541
00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:47,150
(Crocodile pose involves stretching with one leg on the hammock.)

1542
00:52:47,154 --> 00:52:49,320
Then stretch.

1543
00:52:49,322 --> 00:52:50,990
- Do we stretch? - Stretch.

1544
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:53,860
- Stretch. - A little at a time.

1545
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,790
If you can do the dove pose,

1546
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:58,030
- move onto it. - The dove pose is nice.

1547
00:52:58,031 --> 00:52:59,415
It's nice.

1548
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:01,460
If you can't do it, support yourself on your knee.

1549
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:04,470
My knee doesn't touch the floor.

1550
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:06,330
(I want to do it,)

1551
00:53:06,339 --> 00:53:08,455
(but my knee doesn't touch the floor.)

1552
00:53:09,009 --> 00:53:10,510
His knee doesn't touch the floor.

1553
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,280
- He is in the air. - I can't do it.

1554
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,210
My knee doesn't touch the floor.

1555
00:53:16,216 --> 00:53:17,710
Really?

1556
00:53:17,717 --> 00:53:18,950
(His body is strange as well.)

1557
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:21,980
The hammock should be longer.

1558
00:53:21,988 --> 00:53:23,720
Then Kwang Soo and I should change places.

1559
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:24,950
Really?

1560
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:26,590
I am in the air.

1561
00:53:26,593 --> 00:53:28,020
- This isn't my size. - You are right.

1562
00:53:28,028 --> 00:53:29,775
It's too high up in the air.

1563
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:32,075
- It's very high. - Look at me.

1564
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:35,345
Look at me. It works now.

1565
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:37,230
It should have been this way from the start. It works.

1566
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:39,570
- Put your leg on it. - It's too high.

1567
00:53:39,573 --> 00:53:41,670
She must have made it short for Kwang Soo.

1568
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,285
(Struggling)

1569
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,055
(My knee doesn't touch the floor either.)

1570
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,825
(He shows off his strange body.)

1571
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:50,780
This hammock is strange.

1572
00:53:50,784 --> 00:53:51,950
I don't know.

1573
00:53:51,952 --> 00:53:54,050
(He is the tallest, but his legs are the shortest.)

1574
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:55,950
Straighten out this leg and go down.

1575
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:57,590
- There you go. - Put your knee on the floor.

1576
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:59,120
- There you go. - Good.

1577
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,860
- Am I doing it right? - Nice.

1578
00:54:00,861 --> 00:54:03,790
(Good. Nice.)

1579
00:54:03,797 --> 00:54:06,190
What was that? What was that?

1580
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,200
Is that a popular phrase?

1581
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,800
It sounds like she is being sarcastic.

1582
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:10,570
No, you did well.

1583
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:12,330
- Really? Thank you. - Do this.

1584
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:13,670
- This? - Yes.

1585
00:54:13,673 --> 00:54:17,110
- This is the pose. You succeeded. - Okay.

1586
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:19,155
We succeeded.

1587
00:54:19,379 --> 00:54:21,940
- This is the butterfly pose. - It's what you showed us first.

1588
00:54:21,948 --> 00:54:24,550
Move your buttocks up and down and put them on the hammock.

1589
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:27,265
- Up and down? - Move your buttocks up and down.

1590
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:30,950
Now, pull the fabric toward you.

1591
00:54:30,957 --> 00:54:32,920
- Like this? - We pull the end.

1592
00:54:32,926 --> 00:54:34,720
- After you do that, - Do we bring it forward?

1593
00:54:34,728 --> 00:54:36,930
- insert one foot. - What?

1594
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:37,930
Where do you insert one foot?

1595
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:39,960
- Does it go in? - Yes.

1596
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:42,360
Push it in. Did you do it?

1597
00:54:42,369 --> 00:54:44,115
Yes, I did.

1598
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:46,070
My feet are big.

1599
00:54:46,072 --> 00:54:47,340
(Struggling)

1600
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,270
Kwang Soo, you got on the hammock without distributing the fabric.

1601
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:52,770
How am I supposed to do that?

1602
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:54,510
Distribute the fabric, you jerk.

1603
00:54:54,514 --> 00:54:56,210
(Listen to your teacher.)

1604
00:54:56,216 --> 00:54:58,165
Why are you so greedy?

1605
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:00,820
Didn't you learn mathematics?

1606
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:02,605
Excuse me.

1607
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,935
(Kicking)

1608
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:07,760
(What? "Didn't you learn mathematics?")

1609
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:10,490
You always add a comment when the older members are talking.

1610
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:12,690
All right. I only made one comment!

1611
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:14,800
- I am sorry. - You ignored the basic.

1612
00:55:14,801 --> 00:55:15,800
(Thank you for assisting me.)

1613
00:55:15,802 --> 00:55:17,730
Sit down...

1614
00:55:17,737 --> 00:55:19,700
and insert one foot.

1615
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:21,285
- One foot? - Yes.

1616
00:55:21,675 --> 00:55:24,070
- Hold the hammock. - Insert that foot.

1617
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:26,540
- Insert that foot. - He did it right.

1618
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:28,380
(Kicking)

1619
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:30,210
- He did it right! - Insert that foot.

1620
00:55:30,216 --> 00:55:32,180
- I did it. - You did it right.

1621
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:34,280
I got it. Okay, okay.

1622
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:36,150
- Please help me. - Since Kwang Soo is struggling,

1623
00:55:36,156 --> 00:55:38,135
we should hurry up.

1624
00:55:38,558 --> 00:55:40,620
- What? - Insert your foot over here.

1625
00:55:40,627 --> 00:55:42,890
That's right. Did you get to this step?

1626
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:43,990
I can't see anything.

1627
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:44,990
(They can't see the outside.)

1628
00:55:44,998 --> 00:55:46,390
Your left foot goes in here.

1629
00:55:46,399 --> 00:55:47,400
(They can't see the outside.)

1630
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,200
Next... Watch carefully.

1631
00:55:49,202 --> 00:55:51,470
(Here comes the next step.)

1632
00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:53,300
- What? - We can't see anything.

1633
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:56,100
- We can't see anything. - We can't see anything.

1634
00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:59,010
It's impossible to watch.

1635
00:55:59,012 --> 00:56:00,380
I can't see anything.

1636
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,680
- You inserted your feet, right? - Is there a mirror?

1637
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:06,695
Now, grab the top of the hammock and stand up like this.

1638
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:09,080
- How pretty! - How do you do that?

1639
00:56:09,089 --> 00:56:10,350
Do I split my legs?

1640
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:11,590
Like this?

1641
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:13,360
- Yes. - I did it.

1642
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,475
- Do I stand up? - Don't pull out your legs.

1643
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:24,755
Now, grab the top of the hammock and stand up like this.

1644
00:56:25,538 --> 00:56:27,140
- How pretty! - How do you do that?

1645
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,400
Do I split my legs?

1646
00:56:28,408 --> 00:56:29,640
Like this?

1647
00:56:29,643 --> 00:56:31,410
- Yes. - I did it.

1648
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:34,525
- Do I stand up? - Don't pull out your legs.

1649
00:56:34,581 --> 00:56:37,050
(He manages to stand up.)

1650
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,350
(What?)

1651
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,635
- Isn't this it? - Isn't this it?

1652
00:56:40,887 --> 00:56:42,235
Hold on.

1653
00:56:42,756 --> 00:56:44,950
Is it okay to have my head touch the ceiling?

1654
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,250
(Is it okay to have my head touch the ceiling?)

1655
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,420
My goodness.

1656
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:50,560
It's okay, right? It's not dangerous, right?

1657
00:56:50,563 --> 00:56:52,990
Hold on. How did it happen that way?

1658
00:56:52,999 --> 00:56:54,100
This is incredible.

1659
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,330
(It's a unique sight for even a yoga teacher.)

1660
00:56:55,335 --> 00:56:57,600
- It's not an easy pose. - This is nice.

1661
00:56:57,604 --> 00:56:59,030
I thought it would be easy.

1662
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:01,700
Now, bring your feet together and sit down.

1663
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:03,040
(Bring your feet together and sit down in the hammock.)

1664
00:57:03,043 --> 00:57:04,470
It's hard.

1665
00:57:04,477 --> 00:57:05,810
(Does she want us to sit down?)

1666
00:57:05,812 --> 00:57:07,480
(After saying that it's hard, he sits down perfectly.)

1667
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,865
It's a butterfly.

1668
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:12,465
(It's the shape of a butterfly.)

1669
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:15,365
- It's comfy. - It's comfy inside the hammock.

1670
00:57:15,522 --> 00:57:17,720
Close the opening.

1671
00:57:17,724 --> 00:57:20,120
It's like, "Young Gu isn't here."

1672
00:57:20,126 --> 00:57:21,290
Close the opening.

1673
00:57:21,294 --> 00:57:22,620
(The butterfly pose is a success, right?)

1674
00:57:22,629 --> 00:57:25,160
- Like this? - Do we come out like this?

1675
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:26,445
Close the opening.

1676
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,500
1, 2, 3. Peek-a-boo.

1677
00:57:29,502 --> 00:57:32,730
(Open the hammock and say, "Peek-a-boo" to succeed.)

1678
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:35,785
- What are you doing? - "Peek-a-boo"?

1679
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:38,810
- "Peek-a-boo"? - We aren't in kindergarten.

1680
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:40,980
It's a mission. Peek-a-boo.

1681
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,265
(You have to do this to succeed.)

1682
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:43,810
- Is this the butterfly pose? - Yes.

1683
00:57:43,817 --> 00:57:45,210
- Peek-a-boo. - Peek-a-boo.

1684
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:46,965
How cute.

1685
00:57:47,587 --> 00:57:49,520
- For the monkey pose, - The monkey pose is hard.

1686
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:51,935
your feet point outward.

1687
00:57:52,358 --> 00:57:55,320
- Outward. - After that,

1688
00:57:55,328 --> 00:57:57,490
lean back...

1689
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:59,615
and spread your legs.

1690
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,145
Like this.

1691
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:04,370
(Turning)

1692
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,730
(This is easy.)

1693
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:07,600
- Jong Kook is good. - This is the monkey pose.

1694
00:58:07,607 --> 00:58:10,540
Spread your arms and this is the monkey pose. It's easy, right?

1695
00:58:10,543 --> 00:58:11,570
It's easy.

1696
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:13,980
- Good. - It's easy.

1697
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,540
It's really refreshing.

1698
00:58:15,548 --> 00:58:16,750
(This pose is easy and refreshing.)

1699
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,850
It's really refreshing.

1700
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:19,580
- Put your arms down. - It hurts.

1701
00:58:19,586 --> 00:58:21,620
Put your feet down.

1702
00:58:21,621 --> 00:58:24,005
(Screaming)

1703
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:27,245
(She steps on Kwang Soo's fingers.)

1704
00:58:27,961 --> 00:58:30,060
(I think my fingers broke.)

1705
00:58:30,063 --> 00:58:31,490
I think my fingers broke.

1706
00:58:31,498 --> 00:58:34,015
(I need to concentrate.)

1707
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,560
I am sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

1708
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:37,630
It's okay.

1709
00:58:37,637 --> 00:58:39,770
- I think you did it on purpose. - I'm okay.

1710
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,285
- I am sorry. - Okay.

1711
00:58:42,275 --> 00:58:44,955
- You succeeded. - Okay.

1712
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:47,280
- Next is the chandelier pose. - The chandelier pose.

1713
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,980
Let's wrap this up cleanly.

1714
00:58:48,982 --> 00:58:50,480
Okay. We have one pose left.

1715
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:52,980
Let's do the last pose successfully.

1716
00:58:52,986 --> 00:58:55,065
Let's go. Let's go.

1717
00:58:55,288 --> 00:58:58,505
(He flips over to stretch his body.)

1718
00:58:58,792 --> 00:58:59,850
Are you okay?

1719
00:58:59,859 --> 00:59:01,060
(He is amazing.)

1720
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,345
Don't you feel dizzy?

1721
00:59:02,796 --> 00:59:04,115
It's okay.

1722
00:59:04,297 --> 00:59:06,575
Jong Kook might set this up at home.

1723
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:08,960
- He likes it so much. - I could do it at home.

1724
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:11,200
- It's nice. - Since Jong Kook lives alone,

1725
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:12,530
he can do this naked.

1726
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:15,300
(Since Jong Kook lives alone, he can do this naked.)

1727
00:59:15,308 --> 00:59:18,310
- Are you out of your mind? - Naked!

1728
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:20,095
You live alone.

1729
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,725
It will be more comfortable.

1730
00:59:21,915 --> 00:59:24,010
- Shall we go? - Shall we go?

1731
00:59:24,017 --> 00:59:27,120
Lean back and do the monkey pose...

1732
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:28,380
you learned earlier.

1733
00:59:28,388 --> 00:59:31,390
So that you don't move, balance yourself...

1734
00:59:31,391 --> 00:59:32,890
with your hands.

1735
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:36,930
So that you don't get dizzy, put your hands on the floor and...

1736
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:38,975
Kwang Soo. My goodness.

1737
00:59:39,432 --> 00:59:43,045
(They make an unexpected eye contact.)

1738
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:45,530
- What? - It's embarrassing.

1739
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:48,685
- What? - You shouldn't be embarrassed.

1740
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:50,540
Face forward.

1741
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:52,410
I need to watch you to copy the pose.

1742
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:54,310
I need to look at you to copy the pose.

1743
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:56,310
- Okay. - Now,

1744
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:59,910
untangle one leg and bring it backward.

1745
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:01,520
- Backward? - I did it.

1746
01:00:01,521 --> 01:00:02,880
- I can't do it. - I grabbed my ankle.

1747
01:00:02,889 --> 01:00:04,390
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo succeed in one go.)

1748
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:07,060
Bring it backward as much as you can.

1749
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,520
I feel nauseous.

1750
01:00:08,528 --> 01:00:09,845
(Se Chan succeeds as well.)

1751
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:11,590
Kwang Soo, that's wrong.

1752
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:14,000
- My goodness. - Hold on.

1753
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,560
Put your feet on the hammock. No, no. You are doing it wrong.

1754
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:19,785
Bring it to the side and then back.

1755
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:22,270
- Kwang Soo's face turned red. - Please.

1756
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:23,640
- Good. - My goodness.

1757
01:00:23,643 --> 01:00:24,910
(That's good.)

1758
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:26,640
- This is it. Yes. - Did I get it?

1759
01:00:26,646 --> 01:00:27,980
- Okay. - Did you get it?

1760
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:29,410
- Yes. - You succeeded.

1761
01:00:29,415 --> 01:00:30,480
Yes!

1762
01:00:30,483 --> 01:00:32,395
(Success)

1763
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:34,120
(Let's see what their hint is.)

1764
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,565
- This is... - My goodness.

1765
01:00:35,855 --> 01:00:36,850
I feel dizzy.

1766
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:38,720
You succeeded.

1767
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:41,445
(We thank Seung Ok for teaching the challenged students.)

1768
01:00:42,462 --> 01:00:44,560
Men's part and women's part.

1769
01:00:44,564 --> 01:00:47,230
The dance routine becomes different for men and women.

1770
01:00:47,233 --> 01:00:50,655
- It becomes different. - Yes, the men's part is like this.

1771
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:57,995
(Part 3: Challenging men's part)

1772
01:00:58,077 --> 01:00:59,455
Like this.

1773
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:01,580
You two are so good.

1774
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:02,740
They're so good.

1775
01:01:02,749 --> 01:01:04,750
They're good dancers.

1776
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:06,110
This is the women's part.

1777
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,950
While men do that move,

1778
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:11,050
your right shoulder comes forward twice.

1779
01:01:11,057 --> 01:01:12,890
1, 2.

1780
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:14,160
Pretend like you're whining.

1781
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,290
One...

1782
01:01:15,295 --> 01:01:16,930
I'm never whiny.

1783
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:18,430
Start.

1784
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:19,830
1, 2. 1, 2.

1785
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:21,500
So Min is good.

1786
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:24,370
- Then move your hip to the right. - He makes me look better.

1787
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:26,770
- 1, 2, 3. - I can't do this.

1788
01:01:26,773 --> 01:01:28,040
Start.

1789
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,600
1, 2.

1790
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:31,070
Right, left.

1791
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:33,680
(He moves awkwardly.)

1792
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,865
I think Seok Jin needs to pee.

1793
01:01:36,449 --> 01:01:37,550
No, it goes like this.

1794
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:39,850
(I learned to dance like a pretty woman.)

1795
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:41,220
Right, left.

1796
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,880
(Like this.)

1797
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:44,090
I can't do it.

1798
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,160
(Kicking)

1799
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,820
(Stop doing that, Ms. Jee.)

1800
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:49,960
He did it wrong.

1801
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:51,430
(Was I that bad?)

1802
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:52,775
I can't do it.

1803
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,860
(Twitching)

1804
01:01:55,868 --> 01:01:57,000
Are you all right?

1805
01:01:57,003 --> 01:01:59,415
- I'm all right. - "Are you all right?"

1806
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:01,125
That's funny.

1807
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:03,300
Get close again.

1808
01:02:03,309 --> 01:02:04,470
Right.

1809
01:02:04,477 --> 01:02:06,570
It's more powerful this time.

1810
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:08,580
- It's more powerful. - You try to hug her,

1811
01:02:08,581 --> 01:02:11,265
and she goes forward.

1812
01:02:11,751 --> 01:02:13,250
She's running away.

1813
01:02:13,252 --> 01:02:15,665
(When the man comes close, the woman moves away.)

1814
01:02:15,955 --> 01:02:17,535
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1815
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,175
Why are you doing it to her?

1816
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:20,390
Hey.

1817
01:02:20,393 --> 01:02:22,920
- Let go. - I'm standing next to you.

1818
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:24,290
- Why are you doing it there? - What's wrong with you?

1819
01:02:24,297 --> 01:02:25,430
Do it here.

1820
01:02:25,431 --> 01:02:27,000
What are you doing?

1821
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,700
Why? Try it. Hey.

1822
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:29,860
Do it.

1823
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:30,870
Do it here.

1824
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,970
I need to practice too. Who am I supposed to practice with?

1825
01:02:32,972 --> 01:02:34,400
We should be allowed to dance with whomever we want.

1826
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:36,140
I think we are set.

1827
01:02:36,142 --> 01:02:38,695
- What are you doing? - Let's get it started already.

1828
01:02:38,711 --> 01:02:40,310
There's one difficult part left.

1829
01:02:40,313 --> 01:02:42,810
There's one difficult part left. It's done after this.

1830
01:02:42,815 --> 01:02:44,195
Yes, it's done.

1831
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:48,020
(Part 4: Drawing a final circle)

1832
01:02:48,021 --> 01:02:51,050
(This dance is done by pop artists.)

1833
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:53,405
- From the top. - I'm impatient.

1834
01:02:53,459 --> 01:02:55,290
Bow your head first,

1835
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:56,745
jump,

1836
01:02:56,896 --> 01:02:58,230
and as you land,

1837
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:59,490
slide.

1838
01:02:59,499 --> 01:03:03,460
From here, draw a circle with your left foot...

1839
01:03:03,469 --> 01:03:04,870
and finish off with your right foot.

1840
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:08,540
(Slide with one foot first and form a circle with the other foot.)

1841
01:03:08,541 --> 01:03:10,040
This...

1842
01:03:10,043 --> 01:03:12,310
is the first part.

1843
01:03:12,311 --> 01:03:14,080
(There you go.)

1844
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,580
(This is difficult, but she's doing pretty well.)

1845
01:03:15,581 --> 01:03:17,125
That's how you finish.

1846
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,080
This is fast.

1847
01:03:19,085 --> 01:03:21,280
It's kind of fast. The middle part is fast.

1848
01:03:21,287 --> 01:03:22,720
How do you jump from here?

1849
01:03:22,722 --> 01:03:24,035
Is it this?

1850
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:26,005
I got it. Like this.

1851
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,220
(Haha gets it right away as well.)

1852
01:03:29,228 --> 01:03:30,945
Why does my left foot move first?

1853
01:03:32,231 --> 01:03:33,230
Like this.

1854
01:03:33,232 --> 01:03:36,760
(Unlike the other two, he's having a hard time.)

1855
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,130
(I can't believe he's my partner.)

1856
01:03:38,137 --> 01:03:39,470
This is over for me.

1857
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:42,755
It's not good enough for only you two to pass.

1858
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:45,595
- Do we all have to get it right? - Of course.

1859
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:46,910
Obviously.

1860
01:03:46,913 --> 01:03:48,825
So teach me.

1861
01:03:49,816 --> 01:03:51,795
(The last-minute special lesson begins.)

1862
01:03:52,752 --> 01:03:54,605
I can't do the next part.

1863
01:03:55,521 --> 01:03:57,020
Lean back,

1864
01:03:57,023 --> 01:03:58,150
switch your feet and lean again.

1865
01:03:58,157 --> 01:03:59,750
(They have no time, so they have to complete the mission fast.)

1866
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:01,820
(Time keeps on passing by.)

1867
01:04:01,828 --> 01:04:03,160
You do it right away.

1868
01:04:03,162 --> 01:04:04,575
- Is it right away? - Yes.

1869
01:04:04,797 --> 01:04:07,160
(Sweating)

1870
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:09,600
(Practice is the only way.)

1871
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:12,730
(They keep practicing the difficult part.)

1872
01:04:12,738 --> 01:04:14,040
Like this.

1873
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,870
(Will they successfully complete the street dance mission?)

1874
01:04:17,877 --> 01:04:19,595
- The timing is confusing. - It's confusing.

1875
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:22,865
Let's get started.

1876
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:24,680
Oh, gosh.

1877
01:04:24,684 --> 01:04:25,910
(They've already changed.)

1878
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:28,780
You should have stayed home, Ms. Jee. Why are you here?

1879
01:04:28,788 --> 01:04:29,880
Why are you saying that?

1880
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:31,375
Gosh, Seok Jin.

1881
01:04:31,657 --> 01:04:32,790
(How do I look?)

1882
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,645
You look like Kim Kyung Ho.

1883
01:04:35,628 --> 01:04:37,230
(You look beautiful, Ms. Jee.)

1884
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,290
Let's go.

1885
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:39,330
Cue the music.

1886
01:04:39,332 --> 01:04:41,230
(They have to keep dancing until the instructors are satisfied.)

1887
01:04:41,234 --> 01:04:44,200
(How will their first try go?)

1888
01:04:44,203 --> 01:04:46,115
- Cue the music. - I'm Bruno Mars.

1889
01:04:51,144 --> 01:04:54,665
(The intro is freestyle dance.)

1890
01:04:58,317 --> 01:04:59,450
Gosh, you scared me.

1891
01:04:59,452 --> 01:05:02,135
(Gosh, you scared me.)

1892
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:06,535
I'm going to be serious.

1893
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:11,230
(Part 1: Dancing with the beat and body wave)

1894
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:13,375
(Ms. Jee does the wave too.)

1895
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,285
(They're coy.)

1896
01:05:16,502 --> 01:05:18,915
(Part 1 is good.)

1897
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:25,910
(Part 2: Quick-step couple dance)

1898
01:05:25,912 --> 01:05:29,625
(The couple dance is perfect as well.)

1899
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:34,235
(Cheering)

1900
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:37,890
(Part 3: Challenging men's part)

1901
01:05:37,890 --> 01:05:40,450
(They do it perfectly.)

1902
01:05:40,459 --> 01:05:43,220
(Ms. Jee does it perfectly up to Part 3 as well.)

1903
01:05:43,229 --> 01:05:46,590
(This is the most difficult Part 4.)

1904
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:48,545
(Startled)

1905
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:53,030
(The ace couple...)

1906
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,700
(and the one-sided lovers...)

1907
01:05:55,708 --> 01:06:00,095
(do a lovely finale.)

1908
01:06:03,349 --> 01:06:08,305
(They are full of street dance soul until the end.)

1909
01:06:08,721 --> 01:06:11,790
(Great job.)

1910
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:14,520
I wasn't sure if I should express my emotions or act normal on TV.

1911
01:06:14,527 --> 01:06:16,905
(Goodness)

1912
01:06:17,129 --> 01:06:18,430
I had a huge dilemma.

1913
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:20,275
I almost elbowed him.

1914
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:21,700
- Goodness. - Hey.

1915
01:06:21,701 --> 01:06:23,160
When he was going back and forth,

1916
01:06:23,169 --> 01:06:24,600
he blew out of his nostrils so hard.

1917
01:06:24,604 --> 01:06:27,000
(That makes it worse.)

1918
01:06:27,006 --> 01:06:29,040
(It's difficult to dance with a guy who has a big nose.)

1919
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,300
That was so much carbon dioxide.

1920
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:32,070
(It's difficult to dance with a guy who has a big nose.)

1921
01:06:32,078 --> 01:06:34,180
I think dancing is about confidence.

1922
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:36,025
- I agree. - You need to be confident.

1923
01:06:36,148 --> 01:06:38,010
- I'm confident now. - You're doing very well.

1924
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:39,850
I can do this.

1925
01:06:39,852 --> 01:06:41,950
Back and back.

1926
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:43,280
"Back and back".

1927
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:46,950
(Sliding)

1928
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:50,390
(The battle of confidence starts all of a sudden.)

1929
01:06:50,396 --> 01:06:52,090
I'm going to keep thinking about this.

1930
01:06:52,098 --> 01:06:53,190
(What are you guys doing?)

1931
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,560
(I can't stop moving. I love to dance.)

1932
01:06:56,569 --> 01:06:58,930
(Weren't we good?)

1933
01:06:58,938 --> 01:07:00,700
You did very well,

1934
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,200
but you got one move wrong,

1935
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,800
- Seok Jin. - Did I?

1936
01:07:03,809 --> 01:07:05,695
- Did I? - Yes, you did.

1937
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:08,680
(First attempt a moment ago)

1938
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,525
(Creaking)

1939
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,695
This time,

1940
01:07:12,752 --> 01:07:14,565
let's not stand around.

1941
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,520
Let's start far away...

1942
01:07:16,522 --> 01:07:18,350
- and come together. - That's a good setup.

1943
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:19,550
(He's looking forward to it.)

1944
01:07:19,558 --> 01:07:21,705
- It's like going clubbing. - That's so true.

1945
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:24,075
He's already into it.

1946
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:27,885
(He's already in the club.)

1947
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:32,555
(Seok Jin is going to the bathroom.)

1948
01:07:33,939 --> 01:07:35,585
Where is he going?

1949
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,055
Okay, let's get started.

1950
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:40,855
He locked it.

1951
01:07:41,547 --> 01:07:42,840
Open the door, sir.

1952
01:07:42,848 --> 01:07:44,180
There's nobody to hold you.

1953
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:45,480
It's okay. I'll do it by myself.

1954
01:07:45,484 --> 01:07:46,910
- Sir. - I'll do it by myself.

1955
01:07:46,919 --> 01:07:49,020
- I'll do it by myself. - I think this will look great.

1956
01:07:49,021 --> 01:07:51,620
Hurry. You two, go to the front. I can do it by myself.

1957
01:07:51,624 --> 01:07:53,620
- Sir? - Cue the music.

1958
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:54,790
(Ms. Jee gets isolated, and the club version starts.)

1959
01:07:54,794 --> 01:07:56,020
Cue the music.

1960
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:58,730
(Three young people's romance in the club)

1961
01:07:58,731 --> 01:08:00,215
Sir!

1962
01:08:00,433 --> 01:08:01,500
Sir!

1963
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,600
(They can't focus.)

1964
01:08:03,602 --> 01:08:05,655
I left something in there.

1965
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:07,555
I left my phone.

1966
01:08:08,607 --> 01:08:12,195
(The club is getting heated up regardless.)

1967
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:19,395
(Knocking)

1968
01:08:20,953 --> 01:08:24,750
(Are you here by yourself, lady?)

1969
01:08:24,757 --> 01:08:26,720
(Excuse me.)

1970
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:29,845
(What?)

1971
01:08:30,930 --> 01:08:32,515
That sounds fun.

1972
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:35,160
- Open the door. - This looks great.

1973
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:36,545
(Why do they look better with one less person?)

1974
01:08:38,437 --> 01:08:40,685
I think this might look better.

1975
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,625
(She's the only lady, and she's excited.)

1976
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:48,310
(They're absorbed in the story until the end.)

1977
01:08:48,314 --> 01:08:49,310
This looks great.

1978
01:08:49,315 --> 01:08:52,980
(They're absorbed in the story until the end.)

1979
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:54,010
Sir.

1980
01:08:54,019 --> 01:08:56,880
(Playing hard-to-get amongst three people)

1981
01:08:56,889 --> 01:08:58,890
- I paid the admission fee. - This is good.

1982
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:00,320
That was great.

1983
01:09:00,326 --> 01:09:01,920
Hey, what was that? You left me out.

1984
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:03,060
That was practice.

1985
01:09:03,062 --> 01:09:04,590
- Great job. - We have to practice together.

1986
01:09:04,597 --> 01:09:05,590
We were just practicing.

1987
01:09:05,598 --> 01:09:06,690
Why does everybody look happy?

1988
01:09:06,699 --> 01:09:09,100
(There's no end to this love quarrel.)

1989
01:09:09,101 --> 01:09:11,130
- The atmosphere was great. - Was it?

1990
01:09:11,137 --> 01:09:12,400
You looked great.

1991
01:09:12,405 --> 01:09:13,830
I felt like I was watching a musical.

1992
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,100
You're all naturals.

1993
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:16,340
- Let's try it again. - Okay.

1994
01:09:16,342 --> 01:09:18,140
(There's no more practice. It's time for the test again.)

1995
01:09:18,144 --> 01:09:19,610
- 1, 2, 3. Let's go. - Let's go.

1996
01:09:19,612 --> 01:09:21,680
(Let's take this seriously.)

1997
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,540
(So their first of many tries begins.)

1998
01:09:23,549 --> 01:09:24,750
I got it wrong.

1999
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:26,995
(I got it wrong.)

2000
01:09:27,386 --> 01:09:29,420
(People who were good start making mistakes in easy parts.)

2001
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:32,105
Oh, dear. I missed it.

2002
01:09:32,858 --> 01:09:36,205
(They are almost at the end.)

2003
01:09:38,597 --> 01:09:40,215
Why are you touching my legs?

2004
01:09:40,599 --> 01:09:42,145
What are you doing?

2005
01:09:42,234 --> 01:09:43,530
This is going to be on TV.

2006
01:09:43,536 --> 01:09:45,415
Why did you touch my legs?

2007
01:09:45,571 --> 01:09:47,770
(Can they complete this mission?)

2008
01:09:47,773 --> 01:09:49,740
- We'll try again. - Yes, one more time.

2009
01:09:49,742 --> 01:09:51,310
- We'll do it until we get it. - This time,

2010
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:52,610
- make sexy faces. - Faces.

2011
01:09:52,611 --> 01:09:54,380
I'm also Yuruno Mars.

2012
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,825
Yuruno Mars.

2013
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:58,110
Yuruno Mars.

2014
01:09:58,117 --> 01:10:01,650
(There are two hours left. They don't have time to waste.)

2015
01:10:01,654 --> 01:10:03,380
(Can they get it this time?)

2016
01:10:03,389 --> 01:10:04,935
Cue the music.

2017
01:10:09,562 --> 01:10:13,690
(This is freestyle dance.)

2018
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:16,845
(They're enjoying it too.)

2019
01:10:23,275 --> 01:10:26,395
(They dance in unison.)

2020
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,565
(Part 1 is a success.)

2021
01:10:32,618 --> 01:10:37,890
(Part 2: Quick-step couple dance)

2022
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,005
(Both couples are lovely, and it's perfect.)

2023
01:10:46,232 --> 01:10:50,100
(The challenging men's part is also great.)

2024
01:10:50,102 --> 01:10:53,430
(They're almost there.)

2025
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:59,255
(They have to draw a circle which Seok Jin struggled with before.)

2026
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:01,680
(This time,)

2027
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:04,040
(he does it easily.)

2028
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:06,910
(Great. Nice.)

2029
01:11:06,919 --> 01:11:08,265
Nice.

2030
01:11:08,687 --> 01:11:15,505
(It's time for the couple's finale.)

2031
01:11:17,429 --> 01:11:21,815
(Please let us succeed.)

2032
01:11:23,269 --> 01:11:25,155
(They're pleased and satisfied.)

2033
01:11:26,605 --> 01:11:30,300
(They keep dancing.)

2034
01:11:30,309 --> 01:11:35,225
(My body won't stop moving.)

2035
01:11:35,848 --> 01:11:38,710
(The performance is over.)

2036
01:11:38,717 --> 01:11:40,050
Great job.

2037
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:41,150
How was it?

2038
01:11:41,153 --> 01:11:42,180
(His heart is pounding.)

2039
01:11:42,187 --> 01:11:45,150
You had little time, but you did so well.

2040
01:11:45,157 --> 01:11:46,650
I'm serious.

2041
01:11:46,659 --> 01:11:47,920
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2042
01:11:47,927 --> 01:11:49,190
(The dance mission is a huge success.)

2043
01:11:49,194 --> 01:11:51,560
Thank you for joining us, J-black and Mmary.

2044
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:53,190
- We'd like to thank you. - Thank you very much.

2045
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:54,460
It was great.

2046
01:11:54,466 --> 01:11:55,660
Thank you.

2047
01:11:55,668 --> 01:11:57,260
- Great job. - They were perfect teachers.

2048
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:58,630
Great job.

2049
01:11:58,637 --> 01:11:59,915
(They obtain a hint.)

2050
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,770
(Here are the 3 hints put together.)

2051
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:07,740
(161 Mokdongseo Avenue, Yangcheon District, Seoul)

2052
01:12:07,746 --> 01:12:08,880
- Do we vote? - Yes.

2053
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:11,510
You have to exempt a person excluding yourself.

2054
01:12:11,517 --> 01:12:12,610
So Min.

2055
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:13,710
I mean it.

2056
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:14,850
Can't you write your own name?

2057
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:16,180
I have to write somebody's name, right?

2058
01:12:16,188 --> 01:12:17,590
I'm heartbroken that I have to write somebody's name.

2059
01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:19,150
- This is a huge dilemma. - I'm done.

2060
01:12:19,158 --> 01:12:20,975
(Both teams finish voting.)

2061
01:12:21,193 --> 01:12:22,805
I'm worried.

2062
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:24,990
Did you have a good time?

2063
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:26,375
- Yes. - Yes.

2064
01:12:26,398 --> 01:12:28,260
161 Mokdongseo Avenue, Yangcheon District.

2065
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:29,960
161 Mokdongseo Avenue.

2066
01:12:29,969 --> 01:12:31,470
(They have to deliver the briefcase...)

2067
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:32,770
(to this address.)

2068
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:35,600
Where did the briefcase go again?

2069
01:12:35,608 --> 01:12:37,400
- The briefcase. - Please.

2070
01:12:37,409 --> 01:12:39,555
- Can we give it to somebody else? - What's wrong with you, Seok Jin?

2071
01:12:39,745 --> 01:12:42,040
He lost it earlier too. Gosh, Seok Jin.

2072
01:12:42,047 --> 01:12:43,840
This is driving me nuts.

2073
01:12:43,849 --> 01:12:46,195
I should tie the briefcase to my body.

2074
01:12:47,419 --> 01:12:48,880
(If you're not smart, your body has to pay for it.)

2075
01:12:48,887 --> 01:12:51,005
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

2076
01:12:51,457 --> 01:12:53,835
Here it is. What a relief.

2077
01:12:53,993 --> 01:12:56,345
Nobody took it. I'm relieved.

2078
01:12:56,762 --> 01:12:58,230
(He was scared to death.)

2079
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,560
Can we do a prank on Seok Jin?

2080
01:13:00,566 --> 01:13:01,960
Should we hide the briefcase?

2081
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:03,860
We can try doing a prank on him,

2082
01:13:03,869 --> 01:13:06,400
- but it won't affect him. - That's true.

2083
01:13:06,405 --> 01:13:07,770
What should we hide?

2084
01:13:07,773 --> 01:13:10,500
Don't you remember he forgot about his son?

2085
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:12,510
Somebody else should take this. This won't do.

2086
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:13,940
Give it to me.

2087
01:13:13,946 --> 01:13:15,040
- I'll take it. - This is the baton.

2088
01:13:15,047 --> 01:13:16,640
You can't take care of it.

2089
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,935
He doesn't care about anything but his own.

2090
01:13:19,051 --> 01:13:21,220
You have 1.5 hours left.

2091
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:22,920
- That's it? - Right. It was six hours.

2092
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:24,550
- We have to hurry. - I didn't know.

2093
01:13:24,556 --> 01:13:27,550
This is the last round.

2094
01:13:27,559 --> 01:13:28,990
(This is the last round to earn hints.)

2095
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:30,305
Is this it?

2096
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,775
(Why is a song playing all of a sudden?)

2097
01:13:33,799 --> 01:13:35,430
- Is this rap? - What's that? You scared me.

2098
01:13:35,434 --> 01:13:36,715
(You scared me.)

2099
01:13:37,269 --> 01:13:40,855
Jackson. Jackson.

2100
01:13:41,273 --> 01:13:44,085
Jin Young. Hello.

2101
01:13:45,477 --> 01:13:48,110
(GOT7 is back with their 3rd album, "Lullaby".)

2102
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:50,595
(They are not boys anymore. They are men.)

2103
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,010
You scared me.

2104
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:54,210
Please say hi, GOT7.

2105
01:13:54,219 --> 01:13:55,380
- All right. - 2, 3.

2106
01:13:55,387 --> 01:13:58,005
- Come and get it. GOT7. Hello. - GOT7. Hello.

2107
01:13:58,357 --> 01:13:59,390
That was great.

2108
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:00,390
That was much better.

2109
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:02,560
It looks like GOT7...

2110
01:14:02,561 --> 01:14:04,090
was here in 2016.

2111
01:14:04,096 --> 01:14:05,430
- That was two years ago. - Right.

2112
01:14:05,431 --> 01:14:07,800
- It was for the Mark Menu. - Right. Mark.

2113
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,160
We also had them during the summer at the train station.

2114
01:14:10,169 --> 01:14:11,630
That's right.

2115
01:14:11,637 --> 01:14:13,755
- We ripped name tags. - That's right.

2116
01:14:13,772 --> 01:14:15,900
- They were strong. - I remember.

2117
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:17,670
I don't know what we're doing today,

2118
01:14:17,676 --> 01:14:19,240
but I'm getting nervous about facing GOT7.

2119
01:14:19,244 --> 01:14:21,140
- They're very competitive. - I know.

2120
01:14:21,146 --> 01:14:22,880
They're competitive.

2121
01:14:22,881 --> 01:14:24,980
- They didn't go easy. - They didn't at all.

2122
01:14:24,983 --> 01:14:26,810
What are we doing with GOT7 today?

2123
01:14:26,819 --> 01:14:28,120
The final mission is...

2124
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,320
(Running Man has to win 2 out of 3 games to get the final hint.)

2125
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:30,820
Out of the three games we have,

2126
01:14:30,823 --> 01:14:33,450
the team that wins 2 of them 1st takes the victory.

2127
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:34,960
(Can they beat GOT7 and take the hint?)

2128
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,920
I want to win.

2129
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:37,220
Of course.

2130
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:38,230
(They get more competitive because they're facing GOT7.)

2131
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,430
(So Min is the only one who wants their attention.)

2132
01:14:40,432 --> 01:14:42,060
- Do you like them, So Min? - No, Jong Kook.

2133
01:14:42,067 --> 01:14:44,330
- She's blushing. - No.

2134
01:14:44,336 --> 01:14:46,970
Why would you say that? What's wrong?

2135
01:14:46,972 --> 01:14:48,100
Please.

2136
01:14:48,107 --> 01:14:50,000
- I'm sick of this. - Goodness.

2137
01:14:50,008 --> 01:14:51,510
- You're much older than them. - That's not why.

2138
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:55,480
We've never had seven male guests before.

2139
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:58,480
(It feels like there's a rainbow in my heart.)

2140
01:14:58,484 --> 01:14:59,710
Gosh...

2141
01:14:59,718 --> 01:15:01,520
I don't know where to look.

2142
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:02,720
Look at the cameras.

2143
01:15:02,721 --> 01:15:04,720
What were you looking at? Look at the cameras.

2144
01:15:04,723 --> 01:15:07,335
She keeps on running her fingers through her hair.

2145
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:09,190
So Min, your ears will bleed.

2146
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:10,790
(If you keep doing that, your ears will bleed.)

2147
01:15:10,796 --> 01:15:12,975
Why do you keep doing that?

2148
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:14,945
Gosh, So Min.

2149
01:15:16,168 --> 01:15:17,545
(Mini Long Jump)

2150
01:15:17,669 --> 01:15:19,355
Three people from each team will play.

2151
01:15:19,638 --> 01:15:21,800
You must grab your big toes with your hands,

2152
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:24,070
and the person who jumps the farthest wins.

2153
01:15:24,076 --> 01:15:26,140
(You must grab your big toes and jump the farthest to win.)

2154
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:28,640
- So Min is the frog. - The frog.

2155
01:15:28,647 --> 01:15:30,610
- Let's get it. - So Min has really long toes.

2156
01:15:30,616 --> 01:15:32,495
I have really long toes. I can do a thumbs up.

2157
01:15:33,685 --> 01:15:35,320
(Thumbs up)

2158
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,590
I hate how she was trying to be appealing.

2159
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:39,650
(He's being honest.)

2160
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:41,050
I hate how this is supposed to be appealing.

2161
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:42,120
Ready...

2162
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:43,260
(How far can she jump while holding onto her toes?)

2163
01:15:43,262 --> 01:15:44,915
Set, go.

2164
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:47,375
(Collapsing)

2165
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,600
Try again, So Min.

2166
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:51,245
(She tried to look pretty in front of the 7 guys.)

2167
01:15:51,270 --> 01:15:52,830
- Try again, So Min. - Should I?

2168
01:15:52,838 --> 01:15:53,830
- What was that? - Try again.

2169
01:15:53,839 --> 01:15:56,000
Hey, what are you doing in front of GOT7?

2170
01:15:56,008 --> 01:15:57,810
- No... - She's a frog.

2171
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:00,170
- That wasn't intentional. - They're laughing.

2172
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:02,280
- Don't fool around. - Be serious.

2173
01:16:02,281 --> 01:16:03,780
Hey, GOT7 is watching.

2174
01:16:03,782 --> 01:16:05,980
So Min, the back of your ears are red.

2175
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:07,480
- Stop doing that. - You'll get an infection.

2176
01:16:07,486 --> 01:16:08,720
You'll get an infection.

2177
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,665
You'll scrape it.

2178
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:12,850
- Okay. - Give her one last chance.

2179
01:16:12,858 --> 01:16:14,420
1, 2, 3.

2180
01:16:14,426 --> 01:16:15,820
Ribbit. Okay.

2181
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:17,505
(She gets herself together.)

2182
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,675
(It's the same as before.)

2183
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,960
You can't jump.

2184
01:16:22,968 --> 01:16:25,830
This is not bad, So Min. You're in first place.

2185
01:16:25,838 --> 01:16:28,555
(So Min jumps 8cm.)

2186
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:31,000
- Yu Gyeom is next. - Okay.

2187
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:32,170
You have to hold your big toes properly.

2188
01:16:32,177 --> 01:16:33,970
- This is his first time playing. - Right.

2189
01:16:33,979 --> 01:16:35,680
- Will you be okay? - I'll try it.

2190
01:16:35,681 --> 01:16:38,650
- He'll be fine. - You can do it. This is simple.

2191
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:40,135
- One, - I'll try it.

2192
01:16:40,185 --> 01:16:41,780
2, 3.

2193
01:16:41,787 --> 01:16:43,205
(He grabs his big toes.)

2194
01:16:46,491 --> 01:16:49,205
(He does a somersault.)

2195
01:16:49,728 --> 01:16:52,230
If we did that, we would've reached the end.

2196
01:16:52,231 --> 01:16:54,090
Why are you doing acrobatics?

2197
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:56,815
Is he Kwang Soo of GOT7?

2198
01:16:56,902 --> 01:16:58,530
- You're right. - He's...

2199
01:16:58,537 --> 01:17:00,130
dirty.

2200
01:17:00,138 --> 01:17:02,340
- Their hairstyles are similar. - That's true.

2201
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:04,640
- He's Kwang Soo. - I live in the same apartment.

2202
01:17:04,643 --> 01:17:06,955
- Really? - Really?

2203
01:17:07,112 --> 01:17:08,440
You're similar.

2204
01:17:08,447 --> 01:17:09,680
They're pretty similar.

2205
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:11,495
- Really? - They're similar.

2206
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:14,295
(They do look alike the more you look at them.)

2207
01:17:14,386 --> 01:17:16,580
- You two look alike, - Yu Gyeom is handsome.

2208
01:17:16,588 --> 01:17:18,535
- but you look much better. - Thank you.

2209
01:17:19,258 --> 01:17:20,920
- No. - No, he doesn't.

2210
01:17:20,926 --> 01:17:22,860
- Kwang Soo is not handsome. - He looks funny.

2211
01:17:22,861 --> 01:17:25,230
You are in the same category, but you are much more handsome.

2212
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,930
No, he just doesn't look bad.

2213
01:17:27,933 --> 01:17:29,345
(He just doesn't look bad.)

2214
01:17:29,401 --> 01:17:30,960
(This always happens when a guest looks like him.)

2215
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:32,030
I'll try again.

2216
01:17:32,037 --> 01:17:34,055
Ready...

2217
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:35,570
This is really hard.

2218
01:17:35,574 --> 01:17:36,640
This is hard.

2219
01:17:36,642 --> 01:17:38,140
Your feet don't come off the ground.

2220
01:17:38,143 --> 01:17:39,955
1, 2, 3.

2221
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:42,440
(He jumps high...)

2222
01:17:42,447 --> 01:17:43,610
(and lands very close.)

2223
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:44,610
Okay.

2224
01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:46,180
- He's similar to So Min. - Good job.

2225
01:17:46,184 --> 01:17:49,180
- He's similar. - It's 11cm.

2226
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:50,380
(Yu Gyeom jumps 11cm.)

2227
01:17:50,389 --> 01:17:51,675
Okay. Young Jae.

2228
01:17:52,257 --> 01:17:53,490
Good.

2229
01:17:53,492 --> 01:17:55,420
- He got 22cm. - That's a lot.

2230
01:17:55,427 --> 01:17:57,560
- 1, 2, 3. - Great job.

2231
01:17:57,562 --> 01:17:59,090
(Se Chan jumps 30cm.)

2232
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:01,300
- 30cm. - Great job.

2233
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:02,360
(That was farther than they thought.)

2234
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,960
- Next is... - Shall I go?

2235
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:05,230
Okay, Jong Kook.

2236
01:18:05,237 --> 01:18:07,030
- Jong Kook. He's always good. - Go.

2237
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:08,600
- He's good at everything. - Dream team.

2238
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:10,140
- Jong Kook. - Start.

2239
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:13,010
I can already tell that he's going to jump far.

2240
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:14,755
It'll be over.

2241
01:18:15,147 --> 01:18:16,465
I'll go.

2242
01:18:16,548 --> 01:18:17,965
He's good at everything.

2243
01:18:19,051 --> 01:18:22,435
(A tiger jumps on its prey.)

2244
01:18:23,322 --> 01:18:25,090
(He hops...)

2245
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,490
(and hunts the prey.)

2246
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:27,850
- He did it. - 32cm.

2247
01:18:27,859 --> 01:18:29,405
I respect him.

2248
01:18:30,495 --> 01:18:32,675
(He's so shocked that he chokes.)

2249
01:18:33,098 --> 01:18:35,660
Jong Kook, that was 32cm.

2250
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:36,730
You looked so cute.

2251
01:18:36,735 --> 01:18:38,970
- That was a hop. - You jumped lightly.

2252
01:18:38,971 --> 01:18:40,100
- This is the last one. - Jackson.

2253
01:18:40,105 --> 01:18:42,240
- Jackson is the last person. - Will he become the hero?

2254
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,255
(Let's go, Jackson.)

2255
01:18:45,744 --> 01:18:47,270
(Sighing)

2256
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:48,310
I'm sorry.

2257
01:18:48,313 --> 01:18:49,310
(Sighing)

2258
01:18:49,314 --> 01:18:50,640
(He lets out a big sigh.)

2259
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:51,680
I'm sorry.

2260
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:52,980
What was that?

2261
01:18:52,985 --> 01:18:54,010
(Why are you saying what's on your heart?)

2262
01:18:54,019 --> 01:18:55,380
- I... - I understand.

2263
01:18:55,387 --> 01:18:57,520
- I know. - But you can't do that.

2264
01:18:57,522 --> 01:18:59,050
It's okay.

2265
01:18:59,057 --> 01:19:00,250
- He wasn't ready yet. - It's okay.

2266
01:19:00,258 --> 01:19:01,560
(He calms down...)

2267
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,005
(and grabs his big toes.)

2268
01:19:05,097 --> 01:19:07,875
(I'm going to beat Jong Kook.)

2269
01:19:11,036 --> 01:19:13,415
(Goodness)

2270
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,140
He did it.

2271
01:19:17,142 --> 01:19:18,655
(That was on another level.)

2272
01:19:20,178 --> 01:19:21,740
(What's the new record?)

2273
01:19:21,747 --> 01:19:22,810
He won.

2274
01:19:22,814 --> 01:19:23,980
It's 57cm.

2275
01:19:23,982 --> 01:19:25,680
(It's 57cm.)

2276
01:19:25,684 --> 01:19:27,935
Did we win? Did we?

2277
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:30,380
(Running Man versus GOT7, first game)

2278
01:19:30,389 --> 01:19:32,435
(GOT7 wins Mini Long Jump.)

2279
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:34,420
- Good job, Jackson. - Great job.

2280
01:19:34,426 --> 01:19:36,220
- Jackson. - He jumped so well.

2281
01:19:36,228 --> 01:19:37,920
Jong Kook, what if you do a regular long jump?

2282
01:19:37,929 --> 01:19:39,360
- What? - Do a regular one.

2283
01:19:39,364 --> 01:19:40,690
A regular one? But this...

2284
01:19:40,699 --> 01:19:42,900
No, just a regular one.

2285
01:19:42,901 --> 01:19:44,430
- But this... - Jong Kook.

2286
01:19:44,436 --> 01:19:45,630
Jong Kook...

2287
01:19:45,637 --> 01:19:47,270
can't accept what happened.

2288
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:49,600
- I'm not good at long jumping. - Do a regular long jump.

2289
01:19:49,608 --> 01:19:51,000
Why don't you try it?

2290
01:19:51,009 --> 01:19:53,010
- I think he's good. - I can jump really far.

2291
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:54,170
- Really? - Try it.

2292
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:56,025
- From standing? - Standing long jump?

2293
01:19:59,117 --> 01:20:01,420
(Look at that.)

2294
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,580
You're really good.

2295
01:20:02,587 --> 01:20:03,850
Did you see his face after he jumped?

2296
01:20:03,855 --> 01:20:05,175
After he jumped...

2297
01:20:05,323 --> 01:20:07,050
(He stared at you.)

2298
01:20:07,059 --> 01:20:09,105
He was only looking at you.

2299
01:20:09,261 --> 01:20:10,845
- You. - There were laser beams.

2300
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,230
(He jumped far and then...)

2301
01:20:14,232 --> 01:20:16,745
(Are you watching, Jong Kook?)

2302
01:20:16,868 --> 01:20:18,470
He was only looking at you.

2303
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:21,215
(I'll face you.)

2304
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:24,100
(This is Jong Kook.)

2305
01:20:24,109 --> 01:20:25,370
He won.

2306
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:26,725
(This is Jong Kook.)

2307
01:20:29,948 --> 01:20:32,465
(He got a bit farther.)

2308
01:20:33,985 --> 01:20:35,020
(He disappeared from the camera.)

2309
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:36,380
He won.

2310
01:20:36,388 --> 01:20:37,750
- Jong Kook! - You won.

2311
01:20:37,756 --> 01:20:38,890
You did it.

2312
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:41,820
Jong Kook! Jong Kook!

2313
01:20:41,827 --> 01:20:43,390
- What's the matter, Jackson? - Did I win?

2314
01:20:43,395 --> 01:20:45,630
We need to be accurate. Let's be precise.

2315
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:47,215
- I don't need the microphone. - Stop it.

2316
01:20:47,232 --> 01:20:48,300
Stop it, Jackson.

2317
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,430
- Let's measure precisely. - My gosh.

2318
01:20:49,434 --> 01:20:50,660
(I don't care about the show. Let me beat him first.)

2319
01:20:50,669 --> 01:20:52,415
- Where did he end up? - Let's measure precisely.

2320
01:20:53,939 --> 01:20:55,885
(That's almost 3m.)

2321
01:20:57,008 --> 01:20:58,740
- Where did he end up? - That's 280cm.

2322
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:00,755
Both of them jumped really far.

2323
01:21:01,379 --> 01:21:03,565
(Come on, Jong Kook.)

2324
01:21:04,349 --> 01:21:05,350
(Gosh, that punk.)

2325
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,895
Let's just settle that you won.

2326
01:21:07,185 --> 01:21:09,220
What was that? He even took off his sweater.

2327
01:21:09,221 --> 01:21:10,720
- Let's say that he won. - Okay, sure.

2328
01:21:10,722 --> 01:21:12,150
- Fine, you won. - Jackson was great.

2329
01:21:12,157 --> 01:21:14,620
- Jackson won. - You won.

2330
01:21:14,626 --> 01:21:16,145
He's the prince of long jumping.

2331
01:21:16,228 --> 01:21:18,715
- He jumped really far. - That was really far.

2332
01:21:18,897 --> 01:21:20,315
Start.

2333
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:22,100
I wonder who will win this time.

2334
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,660
- My goodness. - Come on, hurry.

2335
01:21:23,668 --> 01:21:26,015
(They must win the second game by all means.)

2336
01:21:26,905 --> 01:21:28,000
Excuse me.

2337
01:21:28,006 --> 01:21:29,240
(Jong Kook goes off to get the hint.)

2338
01:21:29,241 --> 01:21:31,270
At this rate, he will be hospitalized.

2339
01:21:31,276 --> 01:21:33,170
- Are you all right? - He's tired now.

2340
01:21:33,178 --> 01:21:35,380
- He's tired. - Bam Bam is tired.

2341
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:37,040
He's exhausted.

2342
01:21:37,048 --> 01:21:39,035
He looks tired now.

2343
01:21:39,351 --> 01:21:40,980
- My gosh. - One.

2344
01:21:40,986 --> 01:21:43,880
- Team Running Man wins! - Okay!

2345
01:21:43,889 --> 01:21:44,890
(The second match, Dirty Face)

2346
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:46,475
(Team Running Man wins.)

2347
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:47,550
(Team GOT7 and Team Running Man win a round each.)

2348
01:21:47,559 --> 01:21:51,105
(Why Did You Come to My House?)

2349
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:52,690
I see tents.

2350
01:21:52,697 --> 01:21:53,730
(This round will decide the result.)

2351
01:21:53,732 --> 01:21:55,530
- What's going on? - Those are tents.

2352
01:21:55,534 --> 01:21:57,430
Are we all going to go into the tent?

2353
01:21:57,435 --> 01:21:58,530
Everyone has to go in?

2354
01:21:58,537 --> 01:22:00,530
- The team that fits more will win? - Really?

2355
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:03,940
6 members must fit into this 1-person tent.

2356
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:07,340
The team that zips up the tent first will win.

2357
01:22:07,345 --> 01:22:08,480
(The remaining member must zip it up.)

2358
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:09,840
- All right then. - What should we do first?

2359
01:22:09,848 --> 01:22:12,350
- Big members will stay in the back. - Okay.

2360
01:22:12,350 --> 01:22:14,480
- Jong Kook and I won't go in. - Okay.

2361
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:16,350
He has to go in first no matter what.

2362
01:22:16,354 --> 01:22:17,550
If he takes long in the middle...

2363
01:22:17,556 --> 01:22:19,550
- Take off your watch first. - Yes, take it off.

2364
01:22:19,558 --> 01:22:20,920
- Take off your shoes first. - Take your shoes off.

2365
01:22:20,926 --> 01:22:23,175
- Take my shoes off? - Take them off.

2366
01:22:23,728 --> 01:22:25,790
1, 2, 3, 4,

2367
01:22:25,797 --> 01:22:27,190
5, and 6. This is the order.

2368
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,930
They crouched down. Should we do the same?

2369
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:31,515
- Get down. - Should we do that?

2370
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:33,915
Let's go in right away.

2371
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:35,425
Get ready.

2372
01:22:36,308 --> 01:22:37,955
Wait, hold on.

2373
01:22:39,477 --> 01:22:41,980
- You startled me. - Why did you put your hand there?

2374
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,565
(He gets competitive.)

2375
01:22:44,349 --> 01:22:46,010
- You should move back a bit. - Come on, Jackson.

2376
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:47,710
- He's fussy. - Okay.

2377
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:49,650
- He makes a fuss. - Gosh, Jackson.

2378
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:50,820
(Running Man advocates playing fair.)

2379
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:52,235
Get ready.

2380
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:54,520
They're fast.

2381
01:22:54,526 --> 01:22:57,360
(6 members must fit into a 1-person tent.)

2382
01:22:57,362 --> 01:23:00,075
- Go in. - There you go.

2383
01:23:01,433 --> 01:23:03,245
(They enter at a fast speed.)

2384
01:23:04,336 --> 01:23:06,430
(It's neck and neck.)

2385
01:23:06,438 --> 01:23:08,525
- They're fast. Hurry. - Hurry.

2386
01:23:10,141 --> 01:23:11,610
- Hurry. - Go all the way inside.

2387
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:13,240
- Hurry. Hurry up. - He went in.

2388
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:14,740
Okay. Zip it up.

2389
01:23:14,746 --> 01:23:17,465
- We're all in. - Zip it up.

2390
01:23:18,817 --> 01:23:21,695
(It's a battle of who can zip up faster.)

2391
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,850
I'll zip up now.

2392
01:23:22,854 --> 01:23:24,850
(Can they zip up first and obtain the hint?)

2393
01:23:24,856 --> 01:23:28,460
(Or will they lose out to GOT7?)

2394
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:30,705
- Okay, we're done! Okay. - Okay.

2395
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:33,475
(The members went in almost at the same time.)

2396
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:37,100
(Team Running Man finishes first by a close call.)

2397
01:23:37,102 --> 01:23:39,170
- Let's open it. - Hey, we did it.

2398
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:41,885
- We won! We won. - Okay!

2399
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,425
- Did we win? - We lost.

2400
01:23:44,943 --> 01:23:46,010
I just zipped it up.

2401
01:23:46,011 --> 01:23:47,625
- We totally beat them. - We did.

2402
01:23:48,146 --> 01:23:49,610
It was really tight in there.

2403
01:23:49,614 --> 01:23:50,610
(The final score is 2 to 1.)

2404
01:23:50,615 --> 01:23:52,435
(Team Running Man wins!)

2405
01:23:52,684 --> 01:23:56,805
We'll proceed to the last individual voting.

2406
01:23:57,389 --> 01:24:00,220
GOT7 will vote for the last slot on the roulette.

2407
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:01,860
(GOT7's votes will determine the last slot.)

2408
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,320
They're going to vote.

2409
01:24:03,328 --> 01:24:05,415
Haha and So Min's names aren't on the roulette, right?

2410
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:06,430
(Thank you for the tip.)

2411
01:24:06,431 --> 01:24:07,690
Haha's name isn't on it?

2412
01:24:07,699 --> 01:24:09,230
We have to choose who will get the penalty...

2413
01:24:09,234 --> 01:24:10,830
- and who will be exempt from it. - Someone who won't face it?

2414
01:24:10,835 --> 01:24:14,055
Haha is chosen to receive the penalty.

2415
01:24:14,706 --> 01:24:15,800
- It's Haha. - Okay.

2416
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:17,185
(Gosh! Kwang Soo.)

2417
01:24:17,809 --> 01:24:20,070
Three members were chosen to be exempt from the penalty.

2418
01:24:20,078 --> 01:24:21,965
- Really? - 1, 2, 3.

2419
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:24,440
(They drew lots to narrow down to one member.)

2420
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:27,850
(And Ji Hyo gets the exemption ticket.)

2421
01:24:27,852 --> 01:24:30,980
- This member will face the penalty. - It's too obvious.

2422
01:24:30,989 --> 01:24:31,990
It's Jong Kook.

2423
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,220
(It's Jong Kook, naturally.)

2424
01:24:33,224 --> 01:24:35,860
Why me? Hey.

2425
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,815
- Hey. - This member will be exempted.

2426
01:24:39,097 --> 01:24:40,415
It's So Min.

2427
01:24:40,799 --> 01:24:42,730
- She won't face the penalty? - Yes, we voted for her.

2428
01:24:42,734 --> 01:24:44,415
My gosh, this is amazing.

2429
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:47,255
(Running her fingers through her hair paid off.)

2430
01:24:48,206 --> 01:24:50,525
(Congratulations on getting exempted from the penalty.)

2431
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,210
- That looked a bit weird. - I can't believe this.

2432
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,425
(I won't get the penalty today!)

2433
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:58,735
(We wish your new album will be a hit.)

2434
01:25:00,185 --> 01:25:02,705
(All the slots on the roulettes are filled out.)

2435
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:06,635
I'll give you the last hint of the final destination.

2436
01:25:06,758 --> 01:25:08,205
We'll have the whole address now.

2437
01:25:08,259 --> 01:25:09,975
(What is this?)

2438
01:25:10,562 --> 01:25:12,515
- What is it? What? - "First floor".

2439
01:25:13,398 --> 01:25:15,100
- It's on the 1st floor. - 1st floor.

2440
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:18,385
- We must go to the first floor. - Let's go.

2441
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,330
Yes, the first floor of that building.

2442
01:25:20,338 --> 01:25:21,800
I'll sit in the back.

2443
01:25:21,806 --> 01:25:23,185
(They have only 30 minutes left.)

2444
01:25:23,742 --> 01:25:25,225
What is this?

2445
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:26,510
Did you enter the address?

2446
01:25:26,511 --> 01:25:27,570
(1st floor, 161 Mokdongseo Avenue, Yangcheon District, Seoul)

2447
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:28,925
I did.

2448
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:30,610
Let's go.

2449
01:25:30,615 --> 01:25:32,010
(If this is the address...)

2450
01:25:32,016 --> 01:25:34,010
- Is that in Mok-dong? - Mok-dong?

2451
01:25:34,018 --> 01:25:35,010
Do we have to take that road?

2452
01:25:35,019 --> 01:25:37,020
- No, it's the next one. - Yes, it is. Take that exit.

2453
01:25:37,021 --> 01:25:38,550
- This is it. - This is the one.

2454
01:25:38,556 --> 01:25:40,350
- I had no idea. - We're going there again.

2455
01:25:40,358 --> 01:25:42,020
This is it. We're here.

2456
01:25:42,026 --> 01:25:44,305
- It's the building for SBS. - See?

2457
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:45,930
It's SBS' building.

2458
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:48,745
- Look. - We just need to deliver this?

2459
01:25:50,268 --> 01:25:53,900
- What's inside the briefcase? - I'm curious about that.

2460
01:25:53,905 --> 01:25:55,800
- We can't open it though. - I wonder what's inside.

2461
01:25:55,807 --> 01:25:57,240
It's like the Pandora's box.

2462
01:25:57,242 --> 01:25:59,310
It'd be funny if we opened it now.

2463
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,170
Imagine Kwang Soo opening it to be funny.

2464
01:26:01,179 --> 01:26:03,625
(They want to open it more because they're told not to.)

2465
01:26:03,782 --> 01:26:05,095
Imagine that.

2466
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:08,265
(The briefcase isn't locked?)

2467
01:26:08,486 --> 01:26:09,580
Imagine that.

2468
01:26:09,587 --> 01:26:13,220
(He presses it just in case, but it's unlocked.)

2469
01:26:13,224 --> 01:26:14,850
- Stop it. Don't open it. - No.

2470
01:26:14,859 --> 01:26:16,320
No, no. I was just checking.

2471
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:18,530
- You little runt. - Hey, stop it.

2472
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:20,590
- I didn't open it. I'm serious. - They told you not to do it.

2473
01:26:20,598 --> 01:26:23,530
- Don't do it. Put your hands away. - I won't open it.

2474
01:26:23,535 --> 01:26:24,960
I was just checking if it worked.

2475
01:26:24,969 --> 01:26:27,070
- All right. Let's get off. - Thank you for driving.

2476
01:26:27,071 --> 01:26:28,440
Let's get going.

2477
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:31,640
Dangerous Delivery, Briefcase Delivery Race.

2478
01:26:31,643 --> 01:26:33,970
You successfully arrived at the final destination.

2479
01:26:33,978 --> 01:26:35,395
Okay!

2480
01:26:35,547 --> 01:26:36,540
Nice.

2481
01:26:36,548 --> 01:26:38,040
(They manage to deliver it within 6 hours.)

2482
01:26:38,049 --> 01:26:40,180
Since you delivered the briefcase on time,

2483
01:26:40,185 --> 01:26:42,350
7 of you will be exempt from the penalty.

2484
01:26:42,353 --> 01:26:44,665
Only one of you will face the penalty.

2485
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:47,150
- You're not on the roulette. - But the race...

2486
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:48,860
- What's inside? - What is inside the briefcase?

2487
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:49,860
Can we open it now?

2488
01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:52,090
As for the briefcase...

2489
01:26:52,096 --> 01:26:53,890
(What's inside the briefcase?)

2490
01:26:53,898 --> 01:26:55,090
What could be inside?

2491
01:26:55,099 --> 01:26:57,330
(And the secret hidden inside the briefcase...)

2492
01:26:57,335 --> 01:27:00,830
- It will be revealed next week. - What?

2493
01:27:00,839 --> 01:27:02,900
- That's too mean. - This is frustrating.

2494
01:27:02,907 --> 01:27:05,310
- I'm so curious. - You'll tell us next week?

2495
01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:07,425
(I'm so curious. How can I wait until next week?)

2496
01:27:08,446 --> 01:27:11,325
(What on earth is inside the briefcase?)

2497
01:27:11,683 --> 01:27:15,080
All right. Here's the roulette that will choose the member...

2498
01:27:15,086 --> 01:27:16,720
who will face the penalty.

2499
01:27:16,721 --> 01:27:18,650
- I'm not on it. - I just need to dodge this.

2500
01:27:18,656 --> 01:27:20,450
Only one of us will face the penalty, correct?

2501
01:27:20,458 --> 01:27:22,490
Since Jong Kook has two slots right now,

2502
01:27:22,494 --> 01:27:24,360
- he has the highest chance. - Let's go.

2503
01:27:24,362 --> 01:27:25,530
Probability-wise, it'll be me.

2504
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,930
- I don't want to get the penalty. - Probability-wise, it'll be me.

2505
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:29,160
Please.

2506
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:32,130
1, 2, 3.

2507
01:27:32,136 --> 01:27:34,200
(Just like the probability, will Jong Kook be chosen?)

2508
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,440
What is it? Please. Please don't let it be me.

2509
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,800
(Or will an unlucky member...)

2510
01:27:37,809 --> 01:27:39,810
- I have a bad feeling about this. - No, no.

2511
01:27:39,811 --> 01:27:40,940
(get the penalty?)

2512
01:27:40,945 --> 01:27:43,180
- I have a bad feeling about this. - No, no.

2513
01:27:43,181 --> 01:27:45,180
(Will it be Kwang Soo?)

2514
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:47,295
(Or will it be Seok Jin?)

2515
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:50,650
- I have a bad feeling about this. - No, no. It went over.

2516
01:27:50,655 --> 01:27:51,890
- It's Se Chan. - It's not me.

2517
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:54,105
(Se Chan, the unlucky member, is chosen.)

2518
01:27:54,626 --> 01:27:56,260
- My gosh. - It's not me.

2519
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:57,905
(He plops down right away.)

2520
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:00,960
(Lady Luck, why did you abandon me?)

2521
01:28:00,965 --> 01:28:02,945
What have I done wrong?

2522
01:28:05,537 --> 01:28:08,555
We have prepared the biggest water bomb.

2523
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:11,640
We never got 3 bombs at once. It's our 1st time.

2524
01:28:11,643 --> 01:28:13,510
- Right. - I'm curious to find out.

2525
01:28:13,511 --> 01:28:16,040
All right. Drop the water bombs.

2526
01:28:16,047 --> 01:28:18,835
- 2, 1. Go. - I'm nervous for him.

2527
01:28:21,853 --> 01:28:22,850
Go.

2528
01:28:22,854 --> 01:28:25,635
(His knees give way with the water bombs.)

2529
01:28:27,191 --> 01:28:28,475
Go.

2530
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:31,405
(The water bomb turns him into the biggest law-breaker.)

2531
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:38,615
(He disappears from the screen.)

2532
01:28:39,737 --> 01:28:42,055
- His hair in the middle fell out. - My gosh.

2533
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:45,055
- His hair fell out. - Se Chan.

2534
01:28:45,109 --> 01:28:46,755
- Se Chan. - Poor him.

2535
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:48,840
I'm going to take care of my fan!

2536
01:28:48,846 --> 01:28:50,180
- I'll take care of him. - Se Chan.

2537
01:28:50,181 --> 01:28:52,335
- That was strong. - Se Chan.

2538
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:57,880
(What's the secret hidden inside the briefcase?)

2539
01:28:57,889 --> 01:29:00,820
(The secret of the briefcase is revealed at last.)

2540
01:29:00,825 --> 01:29:02,120
(However,)

2541
01:29:02,126 --> 01:29:04,875
(they receive a mysterious call.)

2542
01:29:05,597 --> 01:29:08,075
(Strange incidents happen as they get closer to the secret.)

2543
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:10,430
(Strange incidents...)

2544
01:29:10,435 --> 01:29:14,285
(centering around the briefcase are happening.)

2545
01:29:14,505 --> 01:29:18,585
(Strange behaviors are spotted here and there.)

2546
01:29:18,643 --> 01:29:21,270
(Someone already knows the secret of the briefcase.)

2547
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:23,040
(Some are trying to conceal the secret.)

2548
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:25,635
(Some are trying to uncover it.)

2549
01:29:25,817 --> 01:29:28,295
(Everything will end once the briefcase is opened.)

2550
01:29:28,786 --> 01:29:32,035
(To open the briefcase, the race for Chuseok will be held.)

2551
01:29:32,256 --> 01:29:33,650
(Without a break to catch their breath,)

2552
01:29:33,658 --> 01:29:35,135
(the laughter bombs keep on coming.)

2553
01:29:35,893 --> 01:29:39,875
(They desperately struggle to unravel the secret.)

2554
01:29:40,598 --> 01:29:44,515
(Will they be able to uncover the secret?)

2555
