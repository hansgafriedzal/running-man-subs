1
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:09,485
(6am, Gimpo International Airport)

2
00:00:09,633 --> 00:00:10,930
Please come this way.

3
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:11,930
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin are...)

4
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,885
(the only ones here.)

5
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,825
- Let's get you your microphones. - Microphones.

6
00:00:18,408 --> 00:00:19,970
(Why are they the only ones here?)

7
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:20,970
For goodness' sake.

8
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:22,325
(Why are they the only ones here?)

9
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:25,840
We are here due to the briefcase. What are the others doing?

10
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,465
(Last week)

11
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:33,220
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin had to pass on the penalty.)

12
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:36,020
(It was a match between them and the others.)

13
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,490
(It's game over if we get caught.)

14
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:39,590
(They escaped to the best of their abilities,)

15
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:42,430
(but defeat was inevitable.)

16
00:00:42,432 --> 00:00:45,800
(The penalty belonged to Jae Seok and Seok Jin.)

17
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:47,785
You know,

18
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,770
it was impossible to escape from six members.

19
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:54,040
Jae Seok, I had nine bells on me.

20
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:56,270
You had one bell on you.

21
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,980
How could you get caught with one bell on you?

22
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:00,950
I had bells all over my body.

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,950
I felt like I was having an exorcism.

24
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:04,480
It sounded like it.

25
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:09,150
I got caught the moment my chase began in earnest.

26
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,790
- For goodness' sake. - It was ridiculous.

27
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:13,990
- For goodness' sake. At least... - Gosh.

28
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,490
I went down a floor. I took the elevator down a floor...

29
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:17,500
and got caught by Haha.

30
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,830
- I don't feel like listening. - What?

31
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,855
(Jae Seok cuts him off.)

32
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:23,970
Stop talking.

33
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:25,900
I don't care how you feel.

34
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,840
- I care more about how I feel. - Listen.

35
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,210
Stop talking.

36
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:32,440
I am only talking because there are cameras.

37
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:33,950
I wouldn't talk if there were no cameras.

38
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,080
- That's why people call you fake. - Fake?

39
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,080
You only talk when there are cameras.

40
00:01:39,089 --> 00:01:41,320
- You do the same. - No, I don't.

41
00:01:41,324 --> 00:01:43,390
- I talk whether there are... - Do you want to be punched?

42
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:44,590
Do you want to be punched?

43
00:01:44,594 --> 00:01:47,030
- For goodness' sake. - For goodness' sake.

44
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,530
(I have to carry out a penalty with this annoying man.)

45
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,485
- This is driving me crazy. - All right.

46
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:54,855
Your Blank Penalty Ticket now has a destination.

47
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:59,170
(They don't know where the ticket will take them.)

48
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,310
Where are we going?

49
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,295
(The destination is...)

50
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,110
(Busan)

51
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,780
It's Busan.

52
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,450
(Busan)

53
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,080
(We are going to Busan.)

54
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,920
- Busan? - Thank goodness.

55
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,575
That's the beauty of life.

56
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:14,850
(He talks as if he is from Busan.)

57
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:17,560
- We are going to Busan. - Seok Jin.

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,890
Be glad that you are still alive.

59
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:21,285
Seriously.

60
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:24,455
Let's go right away.

61
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:29,400
Now, we will go to Busan...

62
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,470
and meet many people there.

63
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:33,655
Why are you running the show by yourself?

64
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,910
- What? - Let's get some toasts. Come.

65
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:37,910
(Let's get some toasts. Come.)

66
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:40,980
- Toasts? - Come on. I am buying.

67
00:02:40,984 --> 00:02:42,580
I like running the show.

68
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:44,375
There is such thing as editing.

69
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:48,190
They will edit out the process of getting there.

70
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,815
- What are you talking about? - There is no need to say goodbye.

71
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:54,860
People in Busan, we will see you soon.

72
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:56,390
What are you doing?

73
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,355
Are you meeting friends there?

74
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,930
- I haven't been there in a while. - Me neither.

75
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:02,325
(Let's see how their penalty trip goes.)

76
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,895
(Seoul to Busan)

77
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,595
(What kind of penalty awaits them in Busan?)

78
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,610
(Chuseok Brothers arrive in Busan.)

79
00:03:13,616 --> 00:03:15,480
What are we doing?

80
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:19,280
This is the penalty tour of Jae Seok and Seok Jin,

81
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:23,290
the Century Couple, whose combined age is 100 years.

82
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:27,390
The number you have to get through the part-time job...

83
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,660
(The number you have to get through the part-time job is...)

84
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,615
Part-time job?

85
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:32,930
What?

86
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,300
The number is 100. It's 100 in a Day Race.

87
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:37,340
Part-time job?

88
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,695
(It's 100 in a Day Race.)

89
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,770
(The talk about part-time jobs and number 100 is driving me crazy.)

90
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:42,765
- This is driving me crazy. - This is driving me crazy.

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
- Take the map of part-time jobs. - Part-time job?

92
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,135
Seok Jin has never had a part-time job.

93
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:51,120
What kind of part-time job do we need to do?

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,990
- Take a look at the map. - We can't do 100 jobs a day.

95
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:57,290
We prepared the part-time jobs that represent Busan.

96
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:00,530
You must choose three at the very least.

97
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,600
Depending on the job, something like 1 serving, 1 box,

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,330
or 1 doll gets added up.

99
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:09,100
You can go home after you reach 100.

100
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:11,570
- Listen. - It's 100 for the both of us.

101
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:14,540
While the idea is good, I can't work with someone like him.

102
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:18,210
Hey. I work if I have to.

103
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,750
- I had a part-time job. - When did you?

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,310
I had a part-time job when I was in university.

105
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:23,380
That's ridiculous.

106
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,880
- I had a part-time job too. - What was it?

107
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,180
I worked at a coffee shop.

108
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:27,690
My friends came and drank so much coffee.

109
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,250
And they put it on their tabs,

110
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,320
- so I paid 13 dollars with my pay. - Goodness, Seok Jin.

111
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:35,185
- Putting aside the part-time jobs, - I...

112
00:04:35,198 --> 00:04:37,985
I'm better off doing it alone. He hasn't had any part-time jobs.

113
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:40,000
He can't hold down a job.

114
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,200
- Hey, I can do it. - Seriously.

115
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,840
Hold on. Can 2 people fill up 100 by today?

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,570
It won't be easy.

117
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:47,710
Hold on. This isn't possible.

118
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,310
- We need at least one more person. - No, no.

119
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:51,510
There's no one.

120
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:52,880
- You know what? - What?

121
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:54,865
I have two more chances to hit Kwang Soo.

122
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,820
(It was last week after a mission during their match.)

123
00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:03,105
(Jae Seok still has two more chances to slap Kwang Soo's forehead.)

124
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:09,260
(Jae Seok decided to keep them and hit him whenever he wanted.)

125
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,830
- That's right. Gosh. - What?

126
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,900
I didn't plan this,

127
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,060
- but I didn't hit him. - What?

128
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,400
- You didn't. - I didn't slap his forehead.

129
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,400
- What is it? - I still have two more chances.

130
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:17,570
Yes, you do.

131
00:05:17,574 --> 00:05:19,070
- Do you want to call Kwang Soo? - Hold on.

132
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,625
(Here's our chance.)

133
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:23,710
Think about it. We can't do it by ourselves.

134
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:25,210
- Tell him to come get his slaps. - Whenever...

135
00:05:25,214 --> 00:05:26,510
We must tell him to come.

136
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:28,750
He's not coming here to do the part-time jobs with us.

137
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,950
- He's coming for the slaps. - That sounds fun.

138
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:32,105
I should tell him to come so I can slap him.

139
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:34,750
- He has to keep his promise. - Precisely.

140
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:37,460
- Nice. Good thing I didn't hit him. - This turned out well.

141
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,560
- Then we couldn't have called him. - Hold on. It's Kwang Soo.

142
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,690
- He's not supposed to come. - Hello, Jae Seok.

143
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,245
Where are you?

144
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:43,830
I'm at a hair salon.

145
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:45,815
When does your filming start today?

146
00:05:45,902 --> 00:05:47,925
When does it start?

147
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:49,930
It's 10am, but you're getting your hair done at the salon.

148
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:51,995
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

149
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,440
Remember that last week,

150
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:56,440
I didn't slap your forehead when I was supposed to, right?

151
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:57,940
(He starts the conversation.)

152
00:05:57,947 --> 00:05:59,080
Yes.

153
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:01,750
Your voice already sounds a bit nervous.

154
00:06:01,751 --> 00:06:03,250
(You must have caught on already.)

155
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,435
I still have two more chances to slap you.

156
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:08,650
- Yes, I should get them later. - Yes, you just said so yourself.

157
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,390
You said you'd get them later.

158
00:06:10,393 --> 00:06:12,820
- I'll slap you later, not now. - Fine, I'll take those slaps.

159
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,390
- I'll take them. - Okay, great.

160
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:15,460
Come to Busan.

161
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:17,060
(Okay, great. Come to Busan.)

162
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:19,200
(Come to Busan to get your forehead slapped.)

163
00:06:19,202 --> 00:06:21,630
(Did he say, "Busan"?)

164
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:23,755
You said so yourself.

165
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:26,000
You said that you'd get them later.

166
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:28,940
- Why Busan though? - Come to Busan.

167
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:31,210
Seok Jin and I came to Busan to carry out our penalty.

168
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:33,295
- Hey, come. We told you to come. - Come to Busan.

169
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,810
- Kwang Soo. - Are you being serious right now?

170
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,750
- Yes, I'm serious. - We're serious.

171
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,880
If it's a joke, stop it.

172
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:40,950
This isn't a joke. This is really happening.

173
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,890
- We're serious. - Come quickly.

174
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:44,760
- No. - I'm telling you this again.

175
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:47,760
- Other members... - Why didn't you slap me last week?

176
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:49,845
I told you. Last week, I was...

177
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:52,500
Anyway, you must come to Busan.

178
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:54,070
(Stop talking, and just come to Busan.)

179
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,625
- Jae Seok. - What?

180
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:57,570
Cut me some slack this once.

181
00:06:57,573 --> 00:06:59,795
That's not the point. I can't do that.

182
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:00,810
Come now.

183
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,570
If I go there... Okay.

184
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:03,995
Okay.

185
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:06,710
Okay.

186
00:07:06,716 --> 00:07:09,380
I'll go to Busan because I'm angry.

187
00:07:09,385 --> 00:07:11,580
- I'll be there. - Come quickly.

188
00:07:11,587 --> 00:07:13,320
- When I get there... - Hey.

189
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:14,750
Hey, just get this.

190
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:16,890
With you here, it will be the Unlucky Trio.

191
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:18,975
It will be complete only when you join us.

192
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,690
I can just go and get two slaps, right?

193
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:24,200
- Yes, come get your slaps, and go. - Right.

194
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,000
Come get your slaps, and go. That's it.

195
00:07:26,002 --> 00:07:28,555
- Okay. Okay. I'm coming. - My gosh.

196
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,570
Hurry. Come quickly.

197
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:32,255
- Okay, Jae Seok. - Okay.

198
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:33,640
(To take advantage of this guy...)

199
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,940
And as for the forehead slaps,

200
00:07:35,945 --> 00:07:37,810
- I won't do it when he arrives. - Right.

201
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:39,810
- He needs the slaps before leaving. - Slap him later.

202
00:07:39,816 --> 00:07:41,710
(He needs the slaps before leaving.)

203
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,250
(I can use him as much as I want and slap him afterwards.)

204
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,150
- Keep stalling him. - I mean...

205
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,450
He'll wait until we finish working.

206
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:49,450
Think about it. We need to get every help we can get.

207
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,120
- Gosh, this will be fun. - Two people won't be enough for it.

208
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,190
Are we close to Busan Station now?

209
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:55,830
Yes, you can see the map there.

210
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,400
- Let's go to the closest one. - Let's go to the closest one.

211
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,330
- Let's go to Busan Station first. - Sure, sure.

212
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:03,485
Seok Jin, let's not kid around today. Let's work hard.

213
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:04,900
- I'm going to. - Work hard.

214
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,940
- Do you think I won't work hard? - Don't be lazy.

215
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:09,710
- Hey, you know... - Hey.

216
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,510
- You know... - I read the online forum too.

217
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:14,380
(I'm going to work hard!)

218
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:16,150
A lot of people criticized me there.

219
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:18,105
(Seok Jin, the lazybones)

220
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,605
- I'll work when we're rolling. - Okay.

221
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:24,460
- You cannot leave his side today. - Hey.

222
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,620
- Take your time changing tapes. - Seriously. Today,

223
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,760
you must keep filming him. Stay by his side at all times, okay?

224
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's go. Let's get going now.

225
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,830
Gosh, this is crazy.

226
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:34,485
(What kind of part-time job awaits them at Busan Station?)

227
00:08:34,904 --> 00:08:37,900
(Meanwhile, at a fried chicken restaurant in Seoul)

228
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:40,770
- Hello. - Hello.

229
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:42,040
- Hi. - Hello.

230
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:43,765
- Jong Kook. - Look, fried chicken!

231
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,035
- It's fried chicken. - Go inside.

232
00:08:46,349 --> 00:08:48,535
- Go inside. - Is this real?

233
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:50,050
- Can we have this? - You're going to make us...

234
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:52,120
do something hard today. Is that why you're feeding us?

235
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,420
(Anyway, they're being too nice. Something is off.)

236
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:55,905
Where did everyone else go?

237
00:08:56,425 --> 00:08:57,945
- Everyone. - Yes?

238
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:00,890
Good job on solving the secret of the briefcase for two weeks.

239
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,760
- That's right. - Eat as much as you want today.

240
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:04,530
(This is a reward party!)

241
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:10,030
(Thanks to winning the Chuseok Race, it's a feast from the start.)

242
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,140
This is good. Isn't it good, Ji Hyo?

243
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,400
(Thank you, Chuseok Brothers.)

244
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,610
- This is good. - It's good.

245
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,140
- This is good. - I don't usually eat fried chicken.

246
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:18,240
It's delicious.

247
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:22,010
(Jong Kook has a taste of the victory at least for today.)

248
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:23,750
Where did Kwang Soo go by the way?

249
00:09:23,753 --> 00:09:25,820
- Right, where is he? - What about the other members?

250
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:28,020
- They had that flight ticket. - Right.

251
00:09:28,024 --> 00:09:29,350
- Did they leave for the penalty? - Blank Penalty Ticket.

252
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:32,720
Jae Seok and Seok Jin received the Blank Penalty Tickets.

253
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:35,760
Right now, they're carrying out a penalty to reach the number 100...

254
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,400
with their part-time jobs.

255
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,800
- My gosh. - I just hate the thought of it.

256
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,260
Where did Kwang Soo go?

257
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,800
And Kwang Soo...

258
00:09:41,804 --> 00:09:44,770
and Jae Seok had a reckless bet.

259
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:47,355
- Kwang Soo owes him two slaps. - Right.

260
00:09:47,476 --> 00:09:50,695
Jae Seok summoned Kwang Soo to Busan so he could slap him.

261
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,850
(Kwang Soo is going to Busan thanks to this playful guy.)

262
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,010
He called Kwang Soo then.

263
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,880
- He did it because he's bored. - That's right.

264
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:58,875
(What did Kwang Soo do to deserve that?)

265
00:10:00,022 --> 00:10:03,245
(At that time, at Gimpo Airport)

266
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:08,590
(Kwang Soo who got tangled up out of Jae Seok's boredom shows up.)

267
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,485
(Hello. Am I really going to Busan?)

268
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:18,225
(Gosh, the weather is perfect for a trip to Busan.)

269
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:20,640
Let me put the microphone on you.

270
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:22,370
(He really starts filming now.)

271
00:10:22,378 --> 00:10:23,765
Is this really happening?

272
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,380
(He keeps checking as he gets his microphone.)

273
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,865
Is it really happening?

274
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:30,335
Yes, didn't you get the call?

275
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,120
I mean, I did get the call.

276
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:34,120
(I mean, I did get the call.)

277
00:10:34,123 --> 00:10:35,605
Seriously?

278
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,260
Am I really going to Busan?

279
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,875
(Yes, you're really going.)

280
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:42,630
(Even in front of the boarding gate,)

281
00:10:42,632 --> 00:10:45,115
(he keeps questioning the reality.)

282
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:48,100
(Even after getting on the flight,)

283
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,770
(he keeps questioning the reality.)

284
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,910
(Seok Jin. Jae Seok. I'll see you soon.)

285
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,540
That playful guy started again. What a jokester.

286
00:10:56,545 --> 00:10:57,640
(Kwang Soo, have a safe trip.)

287
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,180
What are we doing today?

288
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,380
Everyone, today,

289
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,550
since you guys won the race last week,

290
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,775
you can enjoy your vacation to the fullest and go home.

291
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:08,050
- We're going to have fun? - Yes.

292
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,020
- We can do whatever we want? - Of course.

293
00:11:10,026 --> 00:11:12,145
- I can do what I wanted to do. - We can do anything?

294
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,720
- A one-day date. - Last time...

295
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,130
(Then I want a one-day date.)

296
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,245
- With whom? - Yes, go on a date for a day.

297
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:19,630
(Who is it? Is she going to start again?)

298
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,625
- She'll say whomever she wants. - Ahn Jae Hong.

299
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:25,270
- Jae Hong? - Great. You two make a nice pair.

300
00:11:25,274 --> 00:11:26,855
- Or Lee Je Hoon. - Lee Je Hoon?

301
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,770
Or Woo Do Hwan.

302
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:31,010
(Here's another one.)

303
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:32,735
- Her type is so clear. - Do Hwan is nice.

304
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:34,880
I didn't know, but he's from Anyang.

305
00:11:34,884 --> 00:11:36,550
- Is that why you like him? - He's nice because he's from there?

306
00:11:36,552 --> 00:11:38,680
- Of course. - Is that why he's nice?

307
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,380
And he has a serious face too.

308
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:41,390
(He's handsome just like guys in Anyang.)

309
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,875
His face belongs to Anyang. His eyes are nice too.

310
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:47,020
I like Jinyoung from GOT7.

311
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,430
I became his fan now.

312
00:11:48,431 --> 00:11:51,160
He's handsome. He's really handsome.

313
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,000
We can go on a date until I get my name tag removed.

314
00:11:53,002 --> 00:11:54,400
(Is this a race of love?)

315
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,985
I'll take it off right away.

316
00:11:57,239 --> 00:11:59,040
You two will be on a date while running away.

317
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,400
- We can chase after you. - That's right.

318
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,240
You'll put on the tracking device.

319
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:03,670
You two will hold hands and run away.

320
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,280
- Gosh, you'll run away. - We'll hold hands while running.

321
00:12:06,282 --> 00:12:08,465
So what's going on with you and Hong Jin Young?

322
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:12,150
(We're way more interested in your story with Jin Young.)

323
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:15,050
- That was sudden. - The ratings keep going up.

324
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,090
I want to date someone on TV too.

325
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,790
You two can be just like Noh Sa Yeon and Lee Mu Song.

326
00:12:19,795 --> 00:12:22,115
Since it's our vacation, we can do whatever we want, right?

327
00:12:22,131 --> 00:12:24,630
I want to do fun games. I just want to have fun.

328
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:25,800
- That sounds great. - I like that.

329
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,255
I want to do drinking games.

330
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,270
Hey, he's the best at drinking games.

331
00:12:29,271 --> 00:12:30,970
- I want to play those games. - Are you good at those games?

332
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:33,355
- The one that goes like this? - I'm the best at it.

333
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,470
(Of course, I know.)

334
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:37,680
(It sounds familiar and feels nostalgic.)

335
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,750
(She seems like she made others drink a lot.)

336
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,405
- Something like that, right? - Can't we just drink in peace?

337
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:45,735
- I saw Jong Kook... - Why play games?

338
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:48,605
- do this a lot at gatherings. - What is it?

339
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:50,520
- Raise your glasses high. - Seriously?

340
00:12:50,526 --> 00:12:52,220
- Is this... - May our friendship go deep.

341
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,130
- Seriously, Jong Kook? - Raise your glasses high.

342
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,430
- Jong Kook. - Level the glasses evenly.

343
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:56,990
That's how he is.

344
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:58,600
- Jong Kook, you're being too lame. - My gosh.

345
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,100
Only old geezers do that.

346
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:01,170
Seriously?

347
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,270
- Loyalty! Yes! - Yes!

348
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:05,240
- Let's go, men. - Drink it, men.

349
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:06,600
- Bottoms up. - Right.

350
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,370
- Bottoms up. - Be a man.

351
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,765
- A man must empty his glass. - A man must empty his glass.

352
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:13,965
Gosh, that's scary.

353
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,410
Okay, you will...

354
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:18,150
present your idea for your vacation one by one.

355
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:20,205
- Should I go first? - Should I start?

356
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,750
- Mine is really simple. - Okay.

357
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,620
- We're going to grill pork belly. - Gosh.

358
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:25,260
- We'll grill pork belly. - That sounds awesome.

359
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,490
Instead of eating pork belly at restaurants,

360
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:29,990
- I want a place with a nice view. - Nice.

361
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,400
(Eating pork belly on a rooftop with a nice view.)

362
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,600
A place on a high hill where we can look down and eat.

363
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,670
Like a rooftop with a nice view.

364
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,170
(Let's eat pork belly while looking at the busy city.)

365
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:39,540
I want to eat at a rooftop with a nice view.

366
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,110
- Sangsang Madang has the best view. - Totally.

367
00:13:42,111 --> 00:13:44,910
(The best view is at the front of the yard in Hongdae.)

368
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:46,380
That has a nice view.

369
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:48,180
Isn't that the place for the best view?

370
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:50,380
- That place is also... - That place has an awesome view.

371
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:53,275
- I'm serious. Right. - You can see Geun Sik there.

372
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:54,875
- There... - Here's mine.

373
00:13:55,157 --> 00:13:58,760
- I've been wanting to try this. - What is it?

374
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:00,290
Riding a bicycle...

375
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:01,930
- on a sunny, breezy day. - Okay.

376
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:03,490
- That one is nice. - Riding a bicycle is nice.

377
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,430
- This will refresh us. - It's the perfect season for it.

378
00:14:05,434 --> 00:14:06,800
- We can only do it now. - Right.

379
00:14:06,802 --> 00:14:09,370
(How about riding a bike to wherever the wind and the sun lead us?)

380
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,540
We can get on the tandem too.

381
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,040
- A bicycle for one? - No, a tandem.

382
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:14,270
- A tandem? - Tandem?

383
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:15,740
- We should call Jin Young then. - Then...

384
00:14:15,744 --> 00:14:17,740
(If it's a tandem, we should call Jin Young.)

385
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,910
- Call Jin Young too. - Right.

386
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,050
(Everyone with the same name might show up.)

387
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,980
- I should give her a call. - You should call Park Jin Young.

388
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:24,550
- You should call Park Jin Young. - Ji Hyo will call Park Jin Young.

389
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:26,150
We can invite Park Jin Young too.

390
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,490
Let's see what So Min wrote.

391
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,920
I want to go to a sauna.

392
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:29,920
(So Min wants to go to a sauna.)

393
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,260
- You want to wash yourself. - We could relax there.

394
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:34,020
- We could eat eggs too. - Sounds good.

395
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:35,760
- Saunas have everything these days. - Sikhye too.

396
00:14:35,764 --> 00:14:37,130
They even have karaoke rooms.

397
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,430
- You can get a massage too. - That's right.

398
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:40,000
- They have everything. - Okay.

399
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:41,270
I wrote this.

400
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,670
"Enjoying surfing".

401
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,800
(Jong Kook wants to go surfing.)

402
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,000
I love surfing.

403
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,540
I went surfing in Yangyang County, and it was so fun.

404
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:50,195
(Surfing in Yangyang County relieves stress.)

405
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,380
Surfing is so nice.

406
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:55,535
Wouldn't it be boring on the way there?

407
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:58,020
(What did you say?)

408
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,150
- What? - Hold on.

409
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:02,650
Once we get there, it'll be really fun.

410
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:05,590
You want me to make sure you're not bored even on the way to Busan?

411
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:08,530
(You want me to make sure you're not bored even on the way to Busan?)

412
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:11,100
I can make you run along the street once in a while.

413
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,260
- Run? - You won't be bored.

414
00:15:12,268 --> 00:15:14,670
- We could play games too. - Of course.

415
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:17,000
I want to help you out, but I can't.

416
00:15:17,006 --> 00:15:19,255
Also, don't sit so far away from me.

417
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,640
What? Why?

418
00:15:20,643 --> 00:15:22,965
Our seats have changed.

419
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:24,880
Don't sit far from me.

420
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,140
Sit down.

421
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,550
It sounds like fun.

422
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:31,235
There's something I really want to try.

423
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,720
Escape rooms.

424
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:33,780
(It's popular these days.)

425
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:35,690
I've never done it.

426
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:39,115
Only those who manage to escape can go home.

427
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:40,520
- Really? - Doesn't it sound fun?

428
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:42,330
- It sounds difficult. - If we work together,

429
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,130
- we can finish early. - I like it.

430
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,700
I love escape rooms.

431
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:47,600
But we need someone smart.

432
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:49,130
- We have some. - We have some.

433
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,230
There's me.

434
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,240
You...

435
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
- What did you say? - Hold on.

436
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:54,370
Hold on.

437
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:55,740
You want to take a quiz with me?

438
00:15:55,744 --> 00:15:56,740
I'm definitely going to lose.

439
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:58,380
I might be able to beat Haha though.

440
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,280
- Hey. - Come on.

441
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:04,010
You and your brother can't beat me.

442
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,350
- My brother? - I can even beat you both.

443
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,280
You just brought up my brother?

444
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:10,205
Come on. I can beat Haha.

445
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,515
Now, I've heard your wishes.

446
00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:16,530
Let me announce the real rules for today.

447
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,030
(Let me announce the real rules.)

448
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,130
Real rules?

449
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,730
(What's the real theme?)

450
00:16:20,736 --> 00:16:22,000
What is it?

451
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,300
(What are they going to do?)

452
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:25,770
Winners Get to Relax.

453
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,770
Special Vacation, Relax for Now.

454
00:16:28,777 --> 00:16:30,370
Relax for Now?

455
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:33,010
You've written down five vacation plans.

456
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:36,505
You have to carry out all of them.

457
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,880
But you have to pay for all the expenses...

458
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,650
with the money given by the staff.

459
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:43,420
(They have to pay for the expenses with the money from the staff.)

460
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:46,090
As soon as you run out of money, you'll be sent to Busan.

461
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:48,130
(If they run out of money, they'll be sent to Busan.)

462
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,100
In Busan, you'll help Jae Seok and Seok Jin complete their penalty.

463
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,400
- That's not okay. - That's not okay.

464
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:54,870
It takes so long to go to Busan.

465
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,425
(We don't want to go to Busan.)

466
00:16:56,672 --> 00:17:00,400
To save money, you can get help from acquaintances.

467
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:02,125
(They can get help from acquaintances.)

468
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:03,510
How much money do we get?

469
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:07,010
You'll choose a pouch randomly.

470
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:09,110
10 dollars is too little.

471
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,780
- We can't even buy the meat. - We can't afford everything.

472
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,880
Even if we get 200 dollars,

473
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,850
we won't be able to afford all the activities.

474
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:16,190
- That's right. - 200 dollars is not enough.

475
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,860
- Who wants to pick a pouch? - Ji Hyo.

476
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,190
Okay. Ji Hyo should do it.

477
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:21,045
- Se Chan, pick one. - Pick 200 dollars.

478
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:22,790
No. If I do it, I'll be humiliated.

479
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:23,960
Ji Hyo, pick 200 dollars.

480
00:17:23,966 --> 00:17:26,130
- "Humiliated"? Hold on. - What?

481
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:28,330
Is that the appropriate word for this situation?

482
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:29,770
If I make a mistake...

483
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,140
No. It's wrong. Hold on.

484
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,440
It doesn't...

485
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,395
- suit the context. - It doesn't, right?

486
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,380
Let's say you were teasing Haha. You were saying you could beat him.

487
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,680
But you lost to him 5 to 0.

488
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:41,380
That's when you say you were humiliated.

489
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,450
- Is that right? - Yes.

490
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,880
You can't use that word in this situation.

491
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,150
How smart you are.

492
00:17:46,155 --> 00:17:47,550
(How smart you are.)

493
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:49,550
(You're so smart, sir.)

494
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:51,220
Okay. I'm sorry.

495
00:17:51,226 --> 00:17:52,660
I shouldn't have said that.

496
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,090
- No, no. - He just said you're smart.

497
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,290
You're smart.

498
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,430
I just said you're smart.

499
00:17:56,432 --> 00:17:59,930
Even if you say I'm smart, it all depends on the nuance.

500
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:00,930
Try it again.

501
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:03,200
- How smart you are. - There you go.

502
00:18:03,205 --> 00:18:04,370
How did you say it before?

503
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:05,955
How smart you are.

504
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,200
It's different, right?

505
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:08,740
- Yes. - Se Chan.

506
00:18:08,744 --> 00:18:10,440
Don't make Jong Kook angry.

507
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:12,735
His nipples are...

508
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:15,850
While I'm wearing this t-shirt, I get horns if I get angry.

509
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,150
Don't make him angry.

510
00:18:17,152 --> 00:18:19,375
I get horns not on the head, but on the chest.

511
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,420
Don't give me horns. Do you know why I'm wearing this bag?

512
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,720
To cover them up? I should focus. Okay.

513
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:27,360
- He just got horns. - I'll focus.

514
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:29,290
- It's pretty thick. - Really?

515
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:30,630
It's thick.

516
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:32,415
Good. It's thick.

517
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:33,830
- Are there many bills? - Are there many bills?

518
00:18:33,836 --> 00:18:35,230
There are many.

519
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:37,030
(It's not just 10 dollars.)

520
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,040
Let me see.

521
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,700
(It's 50, 100, or 200 dollars.)

522
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:43,210
(The more money they get, the less likely they are to go to Busan.)

523
00:18:43,212 --> 00:18:44,340
- Let me see. - It must be a lot.

524
00:18:44,346 --> 00:18:45,680
- No. - How much is it?

525
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,880
(Just 50 dollars?)

526
00:18:47,883 --> 00:18:49,810
Gosh. It's not a lot.

527
00:18:49,818 --> 00:18:51,380
- 30 dollars? - It's 50 dollars.

528
00:18:51,387 --> 00:18:53,050
We can't afford everything.

529
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,180
It's 50 dollars.

530
00:18:54,189 --> 00:18:56,075
What can we do with that money?

531
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:58,190
We can't do much with 50 dollars.

532
00:18:58,193 --> 00:18:59,915
(Each member can spend 10 dollars. What will happen to them?)

533
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:03,690
- This place is so nice. - It is.

534
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,900
What kind of work will we get?

535
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:08,485
Let me tell you what you'll do first.

536
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:11,300
Full of old stories from Busan,

537
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:12,840
Story Bicycle Tour.

538
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:14,455
- Story Bicycle? - Story Bicycle?

539
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:17,895
Senior docents...

540
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,810
give tourists a bicycle ride...

541
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:22,780
around the city.

542
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:25,080
They explain the history behind the tourist attractions.

543
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:27,450
He doesn't just give a bicycle ride.

544
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,650
- He chats. - He... Gosh.

545
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:32,120
- That's not the right word. - I mean...

546
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,120
He talks.

547
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,630
Please be more polite.

548
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:37,730
I mean...

549
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,900
He's older than us. Use a more appropriate word.

550
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,730
He seems to like it.

551
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,170
Story Bicycle...

552
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:44,870
- He seems to like it. Hello. - Hello.

553
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:46,640
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Hello.

554
00:19:46,642 --> 00:19:47,970
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

555
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:49,940
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, sir.

556
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:51,540
- Nice to meet you. - Hey.

557
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:53,480
- Don't try to speak in a dialect. - Be quiet.

558
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:55,950
He thinks he can speak in a dialect.

559
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:58,550
I'm good at speaking in the Busan dialect.

560
00:19:58,554 --> 00:19:59,920
That's good.

561
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,190
What do you think?

562
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,990
- It's okay. - It's okay?

563
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,175
- It's close enough. - Close enough?

564
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:07,045
- Hey. - Hello.

565
00:20:07,095 --> 00:20:08,590
- Nice to meet you. - Hey.

566
00:20:08,597 --> 00:20:11,230
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

567
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,060
I'm Yu Jae Seok, the Son of Busan.

568
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,800
Why are you the Son of Busan?

569
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,100
You're from Seoul.

570
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:20,440
When I'm in Daejeon, I'm the Son of Daejeon.

571
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:22,840
- I'm... - I'm a Story Bicycle rider,

572
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,710
Jang In Gu.

573
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,110
Mr. Jang In Gu.

574
00:20:27,115 --> 00:20:30,280
We have to do a part-time job today.

575
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:32,420
Can we work...

576
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:34,320
as Story Bicycle riders?

577
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,320
Yes, you can.

578
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:39,390
You're supposed to explain to the tourists...

579
00:20:39,394 --> 00:20:42,390
about the modern history and culture...

580
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:43,660
briefly.

581
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:46,700
- To do this job, - How are we going to do that?

582
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:48,600
we should know a bit about the modern history and culture.

583
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:49,870
I'm not sure if we can do it.

584
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:52,540
I'll briefly teach you how to do it.

585
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,370
How long have you been doing this?

586
00:20:55,377 --> 00:20:57,070
It's been four years.

587
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,710
That's not so long.

588
00:20:58,714 --> 00:20:59,910
What are you talking about?

589
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,880
Story Bicycles haven't been around that long.

590
00:21:01,884 --> 00:21:03,580
This job hasn't been around that long.

591
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:04,780
It started four years ago.

592
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:06,220
So you've been doing it from the beginning.

593
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:07,380
That's right.

594
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:11,690
- You're one of the oldest. - During the peak season,

595
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:14,090
how many customers do you get?

596
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:16,390
We get group customers too.

597
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:20,360
Sometimes, 80 to 100 students visit at once.

598
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,755
(80 to 100 students)

599
00:21:22,371 --> 00:21:24,900
If we get 100 customers, we'll be done.

600
00:21:24,907 --> 00:21:26,800
Do you get more customers on the weekends?

601
00:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,010
Of course. We get more then.

602
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,670
On the weekdays, we get less.

603
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,410
You must have been very busy yesterday.

604
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:34,650
It must have been a busy day,

605
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,980
- but I was away. - Why?

606
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:39,035
It was a personal reason.

607
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:40,650
It was a personal reason.

608
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:41,950
(A personal question makes him shy.)

609
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,245
May I ask what it was about?

610
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:46,290
I'm afraid I can't answer.

611
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:47,990
You don't want to talk about it?

612
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,660
- No. - Okay.

613
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,230
- Did you just take a break? - Kind of.

614
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:55,285
(He ends up telling the truth.)

615
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,430
You're changing your words.

616
00:21:57,439 --> 00:21:58,900
You're making me curious.

617
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,640
- It is a personal reason. - That's right.

618
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:03,540
Are there things to remember while working?

619
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,680
- Tell us. - There are.

620
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,210
There are two very important things.

621
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:09,550
- What are they? - When you start the bicycle,

622
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,080
keep your feet off the ground.

623
00:22:11,086 --> 00:22:13,280
- Isn't that obvious? - If you do that,

624
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:16,090
your feet can get stuck.

625
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:18,490
Who would put their feet on the ground?

626
00:22:18,493 --> 00:22:21,160
- It happens. - That's right.

627
00:22:21,163 --> 00:22:23,890
It's okay while the bicycle is moving,

628
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:25,600
but when you start,

629
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:29,200
you should never accelerate. The bicycle might fall.

630
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,870
It can fall backwards.

631
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:32,300
It must be important...

632
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:36,370
for the passengers' safety.

633
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,910
It's important for your own safety too.

634
00:22:38,914 --> 00:22:40,335
(It's important for your own safety too.)

635
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:41,980
(I protect myself.)

636
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:43,650
- You know... - Don't forget...

637
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:45,320
these two things.

638
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,550
Our own safety is important too,

639
00:22:46,555 --> 00:22:48,890
but we should put the passengers' safety first, right?

640
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,990
That's right.

641
00:22:49,992 --> 00:22:52,890
You should protect both the passengers and yourself.

642
00:22:52,894 --> 00:22:56,585
Your glasses are a bit small. They look like your eyes.

643
00:22:57,532 --> 00:22:59,485
It looks like you have very big eyes.

644
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,830
We'd like to try riding it first.

645
00:23:01,837 --> 00:23:04,030
- Try it then. - Okay.

646
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:05,340
We should know how it works.

647
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,970
I'll explain about a few places on the way.

648
00:23:07,976 --> 00:23:09,995
- Okay. - We should memorize them.

649
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,580
This is it.

650
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,040
It's called a Story Bicycle...

651
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:16,235
because you listen to stories.

652
00:23:16,618 --> 00:23:19,350
- It's a Story Bicycle. - Story Bicycle.

653
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:20,450
Right.

654
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:22,890
How fast can it go?

655
00:23:22,891 --> 00:23:24,660
It's not that fast.

656
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,460
But the speed is not important.

657
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:27,920
It should go slowly.

658
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:29,330
It's for sightseeing.

659
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:30,890
(They'll look around the city on a Story Bicycle.)

660
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,600
(Busan Harbor Bridge, 168 Stairs)

661
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:35,085
(Choryang Catholic Church, Choryang Elementary School)

662
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,400
- Oh, my. - It's moving.

663
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:39,040
- It's pretty strong. - It's...

664
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,895
It's quite fast.

665
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,610
You shouldn't put your feet on the ground.

666
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,880
The driver shouldn't.

667
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:49,450
The wind is so refreshing.

668
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:50,835
(He's like a tourist.)

669
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:53,220
The sea wind is blowing.

670
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:54,420
(They forget about their mission for a moment.)

671
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,945
It's so refreshing.

672
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:58,920
Feel the sea wind.

673
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:00,420
The wind is blowing from the mountain and the sea.

674
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:01,830
This area is so beautiful.

675
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,630
It's so cool.

676
00:24:03,632 --> 00:24:07,130
It reminds me of my childhood neighborhood.

677
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:10,670
Small alleys like these are disappearing.

678
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:11,870
This is so nice.

679
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:14,070
- I lived in an area like this. - Me too.

680
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:16,910
(Every alley seems to have a story.)

681
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:19,380
Do you see that bridge...

682
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:20,640
- across the sea? - Yes.

683
00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:23,150
It's Busan Harbor Bridge.

684
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:25,180
- Busan Harbor Bridge. - Busan Harbor Bridge.

685
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:27,420
There's Namgu on the left.

686
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:30,050
It's connected to Youngdonggu on the right.

687
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:32,390
The total length is 3.3km.

688
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:34,790
- "The total length is 3.3km"? - Yes.

689
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:38,060
There are 168 stairs in this staircase.

690
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,985
It's the only shortcut that connects the two neighborhoods.

691
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:46,095
If you don't take this route, you must go around.

692
00:24:46,141 --> 00:24:49,110
However, no one takes the longer route.

693
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:50,110
- Right. - No one would.

694
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:52,710
- This is Choryang Catholic Church. - I see.

695
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:56,980
In the south of Hangang, this is the oldest church.

696
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,850
- South of Hangang? - Yes.

697
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,920
Celebrities have graduated from Choryang Elementary School.

698
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:04,490
Famous people graduated from here.

699
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:05,790
- Who? - Who are they?

700
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:08,190
- Singer Na Hoon A. - Who else?

701
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:11,130
- Lee Gyeong Gyu. - Did he graduate from here?

702
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:13,630
- Right, he did. - From this school?

703
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:15,970
- You should get going. - Okay.

704
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:18,170
- Seok Jin, try it first. - Shall I?

705
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:20,640
- Wait a minute. - On the left...

706
00:25:20,642 --> 00:25:22,640
- are the brakes. - The brakes?

707
00:25:22,644 --> 00:25:24,670
This is the accelerator. Did you hear what I said?

708
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:26,710
- Yes. - Keep your foot on it.

709
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:30,250
If you accelerate too fast, it'll jerk up.

710
00:25:30,252 --> 00:25:31,850
Wait, let me get off.

711
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,020
(He's worried.)

712
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,335
Get off.

713
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:37,150
I'm holding the brakes right now.

714
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,645
- Give it a try. - Okay.

715
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,415
Wait.

716
00:25:43,932 --> 00:25:45,415
(Surprised)

717
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,660
Take the wheel and look forward.

718
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:48,670
(Seok Jin is flustered.)

719
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,370
- Goodness. - It jerked.

720
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,140
(Tumbling)

721
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,470
- Seriously. - That's why I warned you.

722
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:57,370
It's not that. Get out of my way.

723
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:59,180
Director, it's dangerous.

724
00:25:59,181 --> 00:26:02,450
He can't control it very well.

725
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,435
Go slowly.

726
00:26:04,452 --> 00:26:07,320
- He's bad at driving. - Okay, I got it.

727
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:09,275
I got it. Okay.

728
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:12,815
(Let me drive anything with wheels.)

729
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:15,215
(He drives smoothly.)

730
00:26:15,497 --> 00:26:17,930
It's very sensitive.

731
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,630
- You drive it well. - It's sensitive. I must be careful.

732
00:26:20,635 --> 00:26:22,755
You still drive it well.

733
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:26,640
I'll start the part-time job.

734
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,840
- We need customers first. - Customers?

735
00:26:28,844 --> 00:26:30,640
- There aren't many. - We need tourists...

736
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:33,040
- instead of Busan locals. - On Mondays,

737
00:26:33,048 --> 00:26:35,750
- there aren't many tourists. - Right.

738
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,850
- There aren't many on Monday. - Right?

739
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,505
There are some my age though.

740
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:42,490
- Shall we talk to them? - Did they come for sightseeing?

741
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,845
Wait.

742
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:45,975
Hello.

743
00:26:46,494 --> 00:26:48,630
- Hello. - Are you here to travel?

744
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,860
- Yes. - Where are you from?

745
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:53,630
- We're from Taiwan. - You're from Taiwan.

746
00:26:53,635 --> 00:26:57,525
- Would you like to go on a tour? - Would you like to look around?

747
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:01,040
- Okay. - Can you understand Korean?

748
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:03,040
Seok Jin will take you around here.

749
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:05,880
I'll take you around. You got very lucky.

750
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,210
Please enjoy your trip.

751
00:27:08,216 --> 00:27:09,805
See you.

752
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:12,220
(Jae Seok lets Seok Jin take the customers.)

753
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,120
There aren't many tourists here today.

754
00:27:16,124 --> 00:27:18,205
(There aren't any tourists.)

755
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,990
Hello, hello.

756
00:27:20,996 --> 00:27:23,230
- Hello. - Do you live here?

757
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:25,985
- Yes, I own this place. - You're the owner?

758
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,900
- We are... - It's nice to meet you.

759
00:27:27,903 --> 00:27:31,400
I assume you were too busy running your store.

760
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:34,400
- Have you gone on a tour here? - No, I haven't.

761
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:37,410
- You never went sightseeing? - I wanted to get on the bicycle.

762
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:39,535
They told me to ride it at Busan Station.

763
00:27:39,547 --> 00:27:40,640
- Would you like to ride it? - Yes.

764
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,050
What do you think? Would you like to ride it?

765
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:45,220
- Where are you going? - I'm going over there.

766
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,375
Please come with me.

767
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:49,720
They live here,

768
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:51,720
but they never rode the Story Bicycle.

769
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:54,590
Please get on. It's this way.

770
00:27:54,596 --> 00:27:55,590
(He invites 2 customers.)

771
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,085
Come this way.

772
00:27:57,465 --> 00:28:00,060
We'll get going. Are you ready? Are you ready?

773
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:02,525
- Yes. - Yes.

774
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:04,830
Did you put your seatbelts on, Kang Soon and Min Soon?

775
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,840
- Yes. - Yes.

776
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,100
Here we go, Kang Soon and Min Soon.

777
00:28:08,109 --> 00:28:10,640
- Be careful driving. - Yes, don't worry.

778
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:13,140
- Here we go. - Goodbye.

779
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:15,150
- Enjoy your ride. - Thank you.

780
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,105
(Story Bicycles take off.)

781
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:20,420
- Are you having fun? - Yes.

782
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,790
I'll work hard to make the trip enjoyable.

783
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:28,790
- Let's see. I'll explain. - Okay.

784
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:32,755
Look at the building on the side. It's Choryang Catholic Church.

785
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,730
This is Choryang Catholic Church.

786
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,070
Repeat after me, "Choryang Catholic Church".

787
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:38,370
- "Choryang Catholic Church". - "Choryang Catholic Church".

788
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,700
I say "Choryang", you say "Catholic Church". Choryang.

789
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,910
- Catholic Church. - Choryang.

790
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,740
- Catholic Church. - It's Choryang Catholic Church.

791
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:48,080
This is the first church in Korea.

792
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:51,435
Wait, a bus is coming. I'm in trouble.

793
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:52,880
(He reverses.)

794
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:53,880
A car is coming.

795
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,390
(He goes back again.)

796
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,890
Wait, what's wrong with this?

797
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:00,475
(He's completely flustered.)

798
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:02,285
It's sliding back.

799
00:29:02,931 --> 00:29:05,145
(Is this for fun?)

800
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,485
(I'm in trouble.)

801
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,525
I'm in trouble.

802
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:12,225
Why doesn't it go up?

803
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:16,865
Did the engine turn off? Since when?

804
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,710
(He needs to be taken care of.)

805
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:20,695
Now, it works.

806
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:22,750
I'm sorry.

807
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:26,405
(Will he finish his tour safely?)

808
00:29:26,855 --> 00:29:28,420
Can we use it all at once?

809
00:29:28,423 --> 00:29:29,920
- Of course. - By the way...

810
00:29:29,924 --> 00:29:32,390
- Okay. - I never rode Jong Kook's car.

811
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:34,890
- It's a great start. - It's lively indeed.

812
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:36,030
It's lively.

813
00:29:36,031 --> 00:29:38,130
Let's say two members can go on a trip.

814
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,730
- Pardon? From what? - You can pick two members.

815
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,330
(He hopes that she picks him.)

816
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,430
- Whom would you pick? - Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

817
00:29:44,439 --> 00:29:45,940
(Her answer is curt.)

818
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,655
(Their feelings get hurt.)

819
00:29:48,676 --> 00:29:52,180
It's better to be with my peers. I don't have to do as much.

820
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,910
Whom would you pick, Haha?

821
00:29:53,915 --> 00:29:54,940
- Right. - That's a good question.

822
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,905
- I pick Se Chan and Kwang Soo. - See?

823
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,380
Look at his look. I pick Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

824
00:30:01,389 --> 00:30:03,720
(What about me?)

825
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,860
- Look at the look on his face. - Wait a minute.

826
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,490
I was just kidding.

827
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:11,030
This is a variety show. We should laugh.

828
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:13,060
- It's entertainment. - Wasn't it funny?

829
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:14,400
We traveled abroad a lot.

830
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:17,100
- I know. - Were you that uncomfortable?

831
00:30:17,105 --> 00:30:19,640
- What about you, Ji Hyo? - Don't touch me.

832
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,840
How dare you touch my hand?

833
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:22,040
Let's hear Ji Hyo's answer.

834
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:23,210
Whom would you pick?

835
00:30:23,211 --> 00:30:25,380
(Jong Kook trusts Ji Hyo.)

836
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,695
I also pick Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

837
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,150
It's okay.

838
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:31,920
What about you, Jong Kook?

839
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,420
- He won't pick me either. - What about you?

840
00:30:33,421 --> 00:30:35,150
- What about me? - Who would you travel with?

841
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:36,590
I pick Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

842
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:38,150
(Jong Kook picks Jae Seok and Seok Jin.)

843
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,475
(I won't pick you.)

844
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:43,730
The three of us will go. I'll take Jae Seok and Seok Jin.

845
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:46,930
- This is funny. - Imagine how fun it would be.

846
00:30:46,935 --> 00:30:49,070
- It would be fun. - Wouldn't it?

847
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,200
(Where is the van going?)

848
00:30:51,206 --> 00:30:53,440
- Are we going to a sauna? - A sauna?

849
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,140
We're going to your destination and to ride the bicycle.

850
00:30:56,144 --> 00:30:57,640
Are we doing them all at once?

851
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:59,110
- Of course. - I'm curious.

852
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:01,735
(Is Jong Kook recommending the first vacation spot?)

853
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,575
(They thought about the first vacation spot.)

854
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:12,990
(I know a place for bike riding and sauna.)

855
00:31:12,994 --> 00:31:16,790
(Do you mean a sauna where you get beaten?)

856
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,130
(The sauna is free, and Jong Kook knows best.)

857
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:23,700
We'll do them all at once.

858
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:26,240
(Just trust me and follow me.)

859
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:30,010
(The car arrives in the middle of Gangnam.)

860
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:31,840
- Here we are. - Where is this place?

861
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:34,710
- Where are we? - Where are we, Jong Kook?

862
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:37,380
Let's go in first.

863
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:39,020
Okay.

864
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,320
- Let's go. - Let's go in.

865
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:41,905
Okay.

866
00:31:42,223 --> 00:31:43,390
Hurry.

867
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:48,075
(Where is this place where bike riding and sauna are possible?)

868
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:50,560
- Okay. - It's a gym.

869
00:31:50,565 --> 00:31:52,600
(It's a gym.)

870
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,630
- It's a gym. - Okay.

871
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:57,100
- Is this the place? - This is it.

872
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:59,495
(Is this where they'll take their vacation?)

873
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,970
- It's free. - The bike ride is free.

874
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,395
(He's right after all.)

875
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:06,680
- Look at this. - We could also...

876
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:09,950
If you ride it, the wind comes out. Do you feel it?

877
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,120
- There's wind. - Ride it with the wind.

878
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,320
- This is not what I meant. - Check out the breeze.

879
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:15,890
- There's wind. - This isn't it.

880
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,350
Do you feel the breeze?

881
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,860
- This isn't it. - Have a seat, Ji Hyo.

882
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:22,230
- Hurry and sit. - Ji Hyo.

883
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,085
- Just do it, Ji Hyo. - Sit down.

884
00:32:24,132 --> 00:32:27,755
Have a seat. Once you pedal, you feel the wind directly.

885
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:30,030
This isn't the bike ride I was talking about.

886
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:33,540
That costs money. We can use these for free.

887
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,870
- What do you say? - This is his strategy.

888
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:37,910
That's right.

889
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:41,140
- Do you agree that it's a vacation? - Agree.

890
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:44,410
It's true that it's a bike, and we can feel the wind.

891
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:46,650
- We should agree. I like it. - I say...

892
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:49,390
- This is what I imagined. - Okay.

893
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,175
- I like it. - That's right.

894
00:32:51,593 --> 00:32:52,790
Traveling with Jong Kook is the best.

895
00:32:52,794 --> 00:32:56,430
- Be honest. Don't do this. - What's wrong?

896
00:32:56,431 --> 00:32:58,860
Traveling with Jong Kook is the best.

897
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:01,730
- He's the best guide. - That's right.

898
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:03,570
This isn't it.

899
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:05,085
We're happy.

900
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,840
This will be accepted as Ji Hyo's...

901
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:11,170
- bike riding in the wind. - Okay.

902
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:13,640
- That's right. - It's perfect, Ji Hyo.

903
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,535
Get on. This is the vacation you wanted.

904
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:18,850
This is a special bike for you.

905
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:21,420
When you pedal, the wind comes out. See? It's cool.

906
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:23,720
- It's cool here, right? - Stand in front of me. I'll do it.

907
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:26,660
- I like this place. - You shouldn't just stand there.

908
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:28,420
- Go and walk. - Where?

909
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:30,630
- Shall I? - Jong Kook, give it a try.

910
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,530
- It's a strange equipment. - This is...

911
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:35,370
- What is it? - Try it. It has a parachute effect.

912
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:38,100
- "Parachute effect"? - Walk while pushing without hands.

913
00:33:38,106 --> 00:33:39,840
- Like this? - Okay.

914
00:33:39,841 --> 00:33:41,870
Jong Kook is so excited.

915
00:33:41,876 --> 00:33:44,010
- This is great. Okay. - Look at Jong Kook.

916
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:45,780
Can you lower the seat?

917
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,395
- Lower it? - Yes.

918
00:33:47,415 --> 00:33:50,610
Stand up. Wait. It's done. Try it.

919
00:33:50,618 --> 00:33:52,850
- How is it? Okay. - It's great.

920
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:54,220
- This is good. - Are you okay?

921
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:55,920
- Yes, Jong Kook. - Are you okay?

922
00:33:55,923 --> 00:33:57,690
He's so friendly because we're at a gym.

923
00:33:57,692 --> 00:33:59,660
- Seriously. - He's friendly.

924
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:03,130
- He's very excited. - Hold it and be stable. Right.

925
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:06,200
Doesn't it feel like an amusement park?

926
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,900
- It does. - Right, everyone?

927
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:09,255
It's amazing.

928
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,630
- Se Chan, are you uncomfortable? - I'm great.

929
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,370
- Why? - I was just curious.

930
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:15,340
- On my back on this side. - Your back?

931
00:34:15,343 --> 00:34:16,570
- Okay. - Why?

932
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:18,525
(Drilling)

933
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:20,965
Wait a minute, wait!

934
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,680
(This massaging drill will free you from all soreness.)

935
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:24,810
- Wait! - What?

936
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:26,320
Why are you using that on my back?

937
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,650
- Wait. - What's that?

938
00:34:27,655 --> 00:34:29,220
It's a massage gun.

939
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:30,845
I was so surprised.

940
00:34:31,225 --> 00:34:32,990
What do you think? Doesn't it feel nice?

941
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:34,220
You too, Haha.

942
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:35,360
I...

943
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:36,760
I got a massage yesterday.

944
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,530
Your neck is stiff, right?

945
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:40,155
Your neck is stiff.

946
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:44,070
(Screaming)

947
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:46,940
(He can't deal with Jong Kook's kindness.)

948
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:48,200
Seriously...

949
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:49,340
We need to loosen up your muscles.

950
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:50,410
It's a drill.

951
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:53,240
(You don't have to thank me.)

952
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:55,365
Hey, doesn't it feel nice?

953
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,905
I have to escape.

954
00:34:57,185 --> 00:34:58,450
Run!

955
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:00,320
- Run! - Where's So Min?

956
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:02,390
- So Min! - I'm okay.

957
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,990
- I'm really okay. - Come here.

958
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:05,660
- I'll work out on the stepper. - I'm exhausted.

959
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,820
I'll work out.

960
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:08,760
Let me massage your neck.

961
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:10,730
(Massage)

962
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:13,255
(She spits out the water.)

963
00:35:13,301 --> 00:35:15,260
(Jong Kook's kindness makes her spit out water.)

964
00:35:15,269 --> 00:35:17,830
- Hey! - So Min.

965
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,925
- Hey! - What?

966
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:21,240
Are you trying to kill me?

967
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:23,465
I'm just giving you a massage.

968
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,425
It feels nice.

969
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,180
It hurts.

970
00:35:27,181 --> 00:35:29,280
- Massage his bottom. - Okay.

971
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:30,950
- You have to lie down. - Do it.

972
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:32,280
- Lie down. - Lie down.

973
00:35:32,286 --> 00:35:34,935
Lie down on your side. Position your legs like this.

974
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:36,950
Bend your leg. Keep the other leg straight.

975
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:38,650
Right here.

976
00:35:38,659 --> 00:35:40,415
- Here. - No.

977
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:42,430
You can't use it just anywhere.

978
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,215
You're an expert.

979
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:45,660
It...

980
00:35:45,666 --> 00:35:46,700
(The treatment begins.)

981
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:48,155
Hold on!

982
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:51,470
Hold on. It feels weird.

983
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:53,470
- It feels weird. - It's okay.

984
00:35:53,474 --> 00:35:55,195
It feels nice.

985
00:35:56,811 --> 00:36:00,535
(It feels nice.)

986
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:03,180
(He confesses while fighting for his life.)

987
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:04,510
- It feels nice. - What?

988
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,720
- What do you mean? - Hold on.

989
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:09,445
(They're done riding bicycles in the wind.)

990
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,090
Let's start.

991
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:13,590
It's very breezy today.

992
00:36:13,594 --> 00:36:16,330
- The weather is very nice. - Don't be afraid.

993
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,630
You picked the right day.

994
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:19,760
It's a perfect day for a stroll.

995
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,560
(Jae Seok's bicycle is going up the hill smoothly.)

996
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:24,200
I heard it takes two hours.

997
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:25,700
It takes an hour or two.

998
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,800
I've seen it.

999
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:30,110
I didn't know it went to small alleys too.

1000
00:36:30,111 --> 00:36:31,640
You didn't?

1001
00:36:31,646 --> 00:36:34,180
- Small alleys are disappearing. - People don't know.

1002
00:36:34,182 --> 00:36:35,280
They don't.

1003
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:37,010
This is where it goes.

1004
00:36:37,018 --> 00:36:38,680
You didn't know?

1005
00:36:38,686 --> 00:36:40,650
You live around here, but you didn't come here often?

1006
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,790
I had no reason to.

1007
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,405
I get up in the morning, work, and go home at night.

1008
00:36:46,661 --> 00:36:48,745
I've been doing that for 40 years.

1009
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:50,260
- 40 years? - Yes.

1010
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:52,700
I moved here from Seoul in 1977.

1011
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,930
You're from Seoul?

1012
00:36:53,935 --> 00:36:55,570
I worked at an office...

1013
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:58,125
until 1977.

1014
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:01,640
(The Busan citizens start to talk.)

1015
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:03,210
We worked so hard.

1016
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:07,110
We exported a lot in the 70s.

1017
00:37:07,114 --> 00:37:09,680
The neighbors were so friendly.

1018
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:11,235
It was so nice.

1019
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:12,620
People were very kind.

1020
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,450
(The Busan citizens can't stop talking.)

1021
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:17,220
I wanted to get on one of these today.

1022
00:37:17,225 --> 00:37:19,760
- You wanted to try it? - Yes.

1023
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,415
I was lucky.

1024
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,930
I wanted to get on one of these since it's so breezy.

1025
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,785
(Jae Seok can't find the chance to talk.)

1026
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,970
- The 168 stairs are here. - Yes.

1027
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,200
Have you seen them?

1028
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:32,640
- I take them every day. - You do?

1029
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,970
Do you take the monorail too?

1030
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,340
Yes. I take it every day.

1031
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,170
We live up there.

1032
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:40,840
But we don't take it on weekends.

1033
00:37:40,848 --> 00:37:42,750
- Why not? - There are so many tourists.

1034
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,110
They should take it.

1035
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:46,475
I want to promote Choryang-dong.

1036
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:50,690
I didn't know there was a street like that.

1037
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:52,560
I didn't know they were selling old snacks.

1038
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,015
I had no idea.

1039
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,530
- Here are the 168 stairs. - That's right?

1040
00:37:57,532 --> 00:37:59,930
I wanted to explain about it,

1041
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:03,700
but you already know so much about it.

1042
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:04,930
Bye.

1043
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:06,900
(They're the natives.)

1044
00:38:06,908 --> 00:38:08,300
Don't be afraid.

1045
00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:10,595
I've had no accidents for 25 years.

1046
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:12,495
Look at that.

1047
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,010
That's...

1048
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:16,550
- Choryang Elementary School. - "Korean Wave Stars"?

1049
00:38:16,551 --> 00:38:18,950
There are some famous stars who went to this school.

1050
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:22,550
(Many Korean Wave stars went to Choryang Elementary School.)

1051
00:38:22,557 --> 00:38:25,205
Have you heard of Na Hoon A?

1052
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:26,860
- No. - No?

1053
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:31,285
(He suddenly starts to sing.)

1054
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:35,770
(What? We've never heard that song.)

1055
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:37,570
Well...

1056
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:39,495
I know a Chinese song.

1057
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,195
Which one?

1058
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:44,110
(Confident)

1059
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:46,465
- You know this one? - Yes.

1060
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:50,050
("Fairy Tale" by Michael Wong)

1061
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,280
- You know this song? - You're a great singer.

1062
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,380
(The customers are impressed.)

1063
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:56,590
(Sing with me.)

1064
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:58,175
Together.

1065
00:38:58,392 --> 00:39:01,520
(In an unfamiliar place,)

1066
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:05,930
(they met a familiar face and a familiar song.)

1067
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:09,570
(The tour may not be much, but they made a lot of memories.)

1068
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,125
You know this one.

1069
00:39:11,539 --> 00:39:14,970
(Our fairy tale will have a happy ending)

1070
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:18,765
(We love it.)

1071
00:39:19,113 --> 00:39:20,580
Thank you.

1072
00:39:20,581 --> 00:39:23,035
(Seok Jin succeeds in providing customized service.)

1073
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:26,675
Which Running Man member do you like the most?

1074
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:30,320
(We just sang together, remember?)

1075
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:32,405
Ji...

1076
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:38,290
(Is it me?)

1077
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:39,860
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1078
00:39:39,867 --> 00:39:41,355
Ji Hyo?

1079
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:43,800
(You like Ji Hyo?)

1080
00:39:43,804 --> 00:39:45,400
- Song Ji Hyo. - She's beautiful.

1081
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:46,640
I see.

1082
00:39:46,641 --> 00:39:48,455
(Yes, she's beautiful.)

1083
00:39:48,743 --> 00:39:51,065
Look at that. You can get closer.

1084
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:54,380
Those are the 168 stairs.

1085
00:39:54,382 --> 00:39:56,350
There are 168 stairs in total.

1086
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,920
Up there...

1087
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,050
Uptown...

1088
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,690
and downtown...

1089
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,720
(He explains in simple words.)

1090
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:08,015
The stairs connect the two neighborhoods.

1091
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,615
The residents think it's so convenient.

1092
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
(Photo time with Seok Jin)

1093
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,755
(Seok Jin is a great singer, but we love Ji Hyo.)

1094
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:20,570
Have you seen that bridge before?

1095
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:23,110
Yes. But I've never crossed it.

1096
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,070
It's Busan Harbor Bridge.

1097
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,080
I've only seen it.

1098
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,680
I've never crossed it.

1099
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:31,910
It's 3.3km long.

1100
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:34,375
- It's really long, right? - It's so long.

1101
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:36,590
It's beautiful.

1102
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,720
It's even more beautiful at night.

1103
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,590
- The night view is amazing. - I heard it's amazing.

1104
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:40,860
It's very colorful.

1105
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:42,445
(Busan Harbor Bridge looks even more beautiful at night.)

1106
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,930
You've never taken a picture here, have you?

1107
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:45,660
No. This is my first time.

1108
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:47,985
- All right. - Please take a good one.

1109
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:51,055
She lives here, but she's never seen it before.

1110
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:54,325
All right. Here we go.

1111
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:57,265
I wanted to show you around, but you already know...

1112
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,680
- so much about this area. - No, no, no.

1113
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,965
It would have been too hard to talk alone.

1114
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:04,780
(Let the native people help you.)

1115
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:07,535
(He gains respect for the Busan natives.)

1116
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:10,990
(Jae Seok and his customers are back to the starting point.)

1117
00:41:10,991 --> 00:41:12,220
Where is Seok Jin?

1118
00:41:12,226 --> 00:41:13,360
(Speaking of which...)

1119
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,360
- Did he take another path? - This is the only path.

1120
00:41:16,363 --> 00:41:17,660
This is the only path.

1121
00:41:17,665 --> 00:41:19,755
(There's no other path.)

1122
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:21,200
(They're on the right path,)

1123
00:41:21,202 --> 00:41:23,700
(but they're struggling.)

1124
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:27,325
(It's hard to control the bicycle.)

1125
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:30,710
(We'll be a little late.)

1126
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:32,840
(Please go first.)

1127
00:41:32,847 --> 00:41:35,395
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

1128
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:38,510
- That was good, right? - Yes.

1129
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:40,320
(It suddenly stops.)

1130
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:43,220
(The bicycle suddenly stops again.)

1131
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:46,615
(Seok Jin fails to finish the ride.)

1132
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,615
We're finally back.

1133
00:41:51,265 --> 00:41:52,600
Thank you.

1134
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,130
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1135
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:56,530
- You're a great driver. - Let me unfasten it.

1136
00:41:56,537 --> 00:41:58,530
- He's a great driver. - There you go.

1137
00:41:58,539 --> 00:41:59,640
Thank you.

1138
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,155
High five.

1139
00:42:01,575 --> 00:42:02,970
See you. Bye.

1140
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:04,140
- Go, Running Man! - Running Man.

1141
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,695
Go, Running Man!

1142
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,610
It's four down now.

1143
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:09,180
- Just four? - Just four.

1144
00:42:09,183 --> 00:42:10,680
Hold on.

1145
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:13,780
It's almost noon already.

1146
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:16,320
At this rate,

1147
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:18,150
we'll have to stay here for a month.

1148
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,820
We won't be able to go back today.

1149
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:21,890
Hold on. Where is Kwang Soo?

1150
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,985
- He should be here. - Choryang Elementary School...

1151
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:26,630
Okay. Goodness.

1152
00:42:26,634 --> 00:42:27,630
(You want to know where I am?)

1153
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:29,700
(I came to Busan,)

1154
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:34,055
(but is this really happening?)

1155
00:42:35,242 --> 00:42:36,410
Okay.

1156
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,765
(My phone is ringing.)

1157
00:42:38,012 --> 00:42:39,410
- Hello. - Hi.

1158
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:40,740
Where are you?

1159
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:41,940
I think...

1160
00:42:41,949 --> 00:42:43,180
I'm almost there.

1161
00:42:43,184 --> 00:42:47,405
You should be standing in front of me right now.

1162
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:48,880
Okay.

1163
00:42:48,889 --> 00:42:50,950
- Hurry up. - I should keep my promise.

1164
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,220
- Hurry. - Okay.

1165
00:42:52,226 --> 00:42:54,490
Where is he?

1166
00:42:54,495 --> 00:42:57,715
I'll let him flick me twice, eat wheat noodles, and go back.

1167
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,030
We should do another part-time job.

1168
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:01,660
- Let's go. - Hold on.

1169
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:03,800
- We can't go back at this rate. - We can't.

1170
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:05,570
- When will we finish 100? - When will we finish 100?

1171
00:43:05,573 --> 00:43:07,740
(They have to hurry up and finish 100.)

1172
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:11,010
He's here. Kwang Soo is here.

1173
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:14,680
(Kwang Soo traveled from Seoul to Busan to be hit on the forehead.)

1174
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:15,780
Okay.

1175
00:43:15,783 --> 00:43:17,950
(100 in a Day Race's guest, Actor Lee Kwang Soo)

1176
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,405
You really came?

1177
00:43:19,453 --> 00:43:20,975
You came?

1178
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,590
Okay.

1179
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,175
I shouldn't have said it.

1180
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:25,490
(You should be careful with what you say.)

1181
00:43:25,492 --> 00:43:27,160
Okay. I should keep my promise.

1182
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:28,860
- Pick up your phone. - Hello.

1183
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:30,360
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

1184
00:43:30,364 --> 00:43:31,530
What is this?

1185
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,100
- Why is he here? - Why aren't you here yet?

1186
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,555
I'm here!

1187
00:43:35,035 --> 00:43:36,930
- I'm in Busan! - He really came.

1188
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,300
- I'm here. - Just go back.

1189
00:43:38,305 --> 00:43:40,040
- He's here now. - Okay.

1190
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,970
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1191
00:43:41,976 --> 00:43:44,110
Don't get the wrong idea.

1192
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:45,170
The thing is,

1193
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,780
I didn't skip it on purpose last week.

1194
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,040
Everyone forgot.

1195
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:50,680
- I forgot too. - Exactly.

1196
00:43:50,684 --> 00:43:53,320
Everything has been recorded.

1197
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,950
- I admit it. - Okay.

1198
00:43:54,955 --> 00:43:56,490
All right. Then...

1199
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,090
- Let's move to the next spot. - Let's go.

1200
00:43:58,092 --> 00:43:59,360
(You admit it?)

1201
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,590
What are you talking about?

1202
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:02,860
He didn't say when he'd hit you.

1203
00:44:02,863 --> 00:44:04,515
Did I say when?

1204
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:06,485
- I didn't, right? - What?

1205
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:09,030
Let's just go.

1206
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:11,200
- I have a shoot in Seoul. - What?

1207
00:44:11,205 --> 00:44:14,570
(Are you serious?)

1208
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,965
Hit me right now.

1209
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:18,510
- Do it. - Get up.

1210
00:44:18,512 --> 00:44:20,010
What's going on?

1211
00:44:20,014 --> 00:44:21,180
I have to go back.

1212
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:22,440
Get up. I have to go back too.

1213
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:24,510
We were supposed to start at 10am, but it's past that.

1214
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:26,620
I have something to do at a chicken restaurant.

1215
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,920
- Look. - What do you mean?

1216
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:29,550
- We're shooting too. - Aren't we shooting?

1217
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:30,820
- I know. - Look.

1218
00:44:30,824 --> 00:44:32,345
- Do you know him? - I...

1219
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:34,590
- Do you know Kwon Ryeol? - I do.

1220
00:44:34,595 --> 00:44:36,760
- You don't know him? - I know everyone.

1221
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:38,030
Exactly.

1222
00:44:38,032 --> 00:44:39,800
- Listen. - This is Running Man too.

1223
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,000
I'm different from you.

1224
00:44:41,001 --> 00:44:43,325
I heard the other team is having a party.

1225
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:44,870
- They're having a party. - What party?

1226
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:46,740
- Theirs is a vacation race. - It's a vacation race.

1227
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,000
People who were invited aren't there yet.

1228
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:50,465
(What party?)

1229
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:52,880
This is a vacation.

1230
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,740
(Only Jong Kook is excited.)

1231
00:44:55,749 --> 00:44:57,450
Shall we go to Gukje Market?

1232
00:44:57,451 --> 00:44:59,820
Let's go to Ohryuk Island. Let's go there.

1233
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,180
Let's go to Ohryuk Island, Kwang Soo.

1234
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,890
- Let's go there first. - Ohryuk Island?

1235
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:04,720
- Let's go there. - Okay, let's go.

1236
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:07,360
You still get a flick on your forehead.

1237
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:08,360
(Ohryuk Island)

1238
00:45:08,362 --> 00:45:11,690
(They go for their part-time job.)

1239
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:14,300
We have to get 100 people. We're in trouble.

1240
00:45:14,301 --> 00:45:15,530
100 people?

1241
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:17,300
It could be 100.

1242
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:18,970
- You don't need to worry. - Don't worry.

1243
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:20,740
You won't be penalized, so don't do anything.

1244
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:21,740
- Okay. - It makes no sense.

1245
00:45:21,742 --> 00:45:23,340
You'll only get a flick on your forehead.

1246
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:25,010
(Don't worry about 100.)

1247
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:26,840
(You need to flick my head then.)

1248
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:30,305
I can't flick your forehead because I'm working right now.

1249
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,880
How long will this take?

1250
00:45:32,886 --> 00:45:35,180
Kwang Soo, I'm here to be penalized.

1251
00:45:35,189 --> 00:45:37,320
This is my work for today.

1252
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:38,820
I shouldn't have said that.

1253
00:45:38,826 --> 00:45:40,090
(He regrets saying it last week.)

1254
00:45:40,094 --> 00:45:43,085
Think about it. We must get 100 soon...

1255
00:45:43,163 --> 00:45:44,830
for my work to be over.

1256
00:45:44,832 --> 00:45:47,030
You can help us so that work finishes soon.

1257
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:48,485
What?

1258
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:51,300
(What? Help?)

1259
00:45:51,305 --> 00:45:53,040
- I don't want you to. - Come on.

1260
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,740
- I don't want you to help us. - I don't either.

1261
00:45:54,742 --> 00:45:57,610
However, we have to finish soon so you can go back to Seoul.

1262
00:45:57,611 --> 00:46:00,265
You're horrible.

1263
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:04,135
I've never seen such a brat like him.

1264
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:05,880
I can't stop him.

1265
00:46:05,886 --> 00:46:07,905
I gave up.

1266
00:46:07,955 --> 00:46:09,675
It makes no sense.

1267
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,350
The way you're thinking is already not making sense.

1268
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:16,930
(They arrive at Ohryuk Island, their next part-time job's destination.)

1269
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,900
(What kind of part-time job will they do here?)

1270
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,785
We'll go do our part-time job.

1271
00:46:24,171 --> 00:46:26,200
(However,)

1272
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:31,210
(where's Seok Jin, the other part-timer?)

1273
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:32,470
(Part-timer Seok Jin)

1274
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:37,135
(Wake up. It's time for your part-time job.)

1275
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:38,280
(He was sleeping deeply.)

1276
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:39,450
Is he sleeping?

1277
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:42,990
(He looks around.)

1278
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,990
(Do you feel refreshed?)

1279
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,220
Hey.

1280
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:48,260
Why did you get out so discreetly?

1281
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:51,160
- Goodness. - Why did you leave discreetly?

1282
00:46:51,165 --> 00:46:53,985
Why did you sleep?

1283
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,485
What about our part-time job?

1284
00:46:56,136 --> 00:46:59,440
I was recharging my energy during transport.

1285
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,840
You should've said, "Seok Jin, we're here."

1286
00:47:01,842 --> 00:47:04,410
Why don't you use your mouth?

1287
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:07,510
It's the same for you. You're rude.

1288
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:09,550
- Seok Jin. - Goodness.

1289
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:11,535
You got so startled.

1290
00:47:11,685 --> 00:47:14,405
This is great. Is that Ohryuk Island?

1291
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,650
(It's a beautiful island.)

1292
00:47:16,657 --> 00:47:18,750
Thanks to me, you get to see this view.

1293
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:21,315
- It's beautiful here. - You should pay me.

1294
00:47:21,562 --> 00:47:23,285
It's really beautiful.

1295
00:47:23,664 --> 00:47:25,530
What's skywalking?

1296
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:27,055
(What job will they do?)

1297
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:30,300
(It's time.)

1298
00:47:30,304 --> 00:47:31,825
- Jae Seok. - This is great.

1299
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:34,540
(I have something to tell you before your work starts.)

1300
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,925
What?

1301
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:38,740
Not here.

1302
00:47:38,745 --> 00:47:39,780
I can't do it here.

1303
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,910
- I'll do it later. - I came all the way here.

1304
00:47:40,914 --> 00:47:42,440
I have to work now.

1305
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:44,750
(I'm too busy right now.)

1306
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:46,680
I'll explain.

1307
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,490
Your second part-time job is cleaning skywalk glass floors...

1308
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:52,860
at a cliff that's 35m above sea level.

1309
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,315
(Skywalk Glass Cleaning)

1310
00:47:55,762 --> 00:47:57,030
What?

1311
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,260
- What? - Skywalk?

1312
00:47:58,265 --> 00:47:59,290
Take a look.

1313
00:47:59,299 --> 00:48:00,300
(Today's part-time job)

1314
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,785
There's a skywalk at a cliff 35m up.

1315
00:48:04,938 --> 00:48:09,655
The skywalk is made up of 24 glass tiles.

1316
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:12,910
We'll count the number of tiles you clean.

1317
00:48:12,913 --> 00:48:16,180
(The number is subtracted from 96.)

1318
00:48:16,183 --> 00:48:17,805
Clean the floor?

1319
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:19,650
Isn't it see-through?

1320
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:20,720
(They're afraid of heights.)

1321
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:21,880
Listen.

1322
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:23,890
Should I stay here?

1323
00:48:23,891 --> 00:48:25,220
Where would you go?

1324
00:48:25,225 --> 00:48:27,260
You came all the way here,

1325
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:30,685
so if you help them, we'll count yours too.

1326
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,260
So you...

1327
00:48:32,266 --> 00:48:33,630
- What are you talking about? - Don't do it.

1328
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:34,860
Don't do it.

1329
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:36,370
Why would I be penalized?

1330
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:37,470
This isn't your penalty.

1331
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:40,070
I won last week. I even got a gift set.

1332
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:41,300
Don't do it.

1333
00:48:41,308 --> 00:48:43,010
- Just stay. - Just stay for now.

1334
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:44,810
The manager will explain the details.

1335
00:48:44,811 --> 00:48:46,280
- I think... - Hello.

1336
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,510
Hello.

1337
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:50,950
- Hello. - This is what I just heard.

1338
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:54,420
- Do we have to clean the skywalk? - Please stand here.

1339
00:48:54,421 --> 00:48:57,290
When it rains, the water remains on the glass.

1340
00:48:57,291 --> 00:48:59,490
We have to clean it for other people to see.

1341
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:01,160
- That's why. - To make it look transparent?

1342
00:49:01,161 --> 00:49:03,990
- Do you actually do this cleaning? - Yes.

1343
00:49:03,997 --> 00:49:05,530
Did it rain yesterday?

1344
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:07,660
It didn't rain yesterday but the day before.

1345
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:10,300
(What does he mean?)

1346
00:49:10,304 --> 00:49:11,630
- When? - The day before?

1347
00:49:11,638 --> 00:49:14,155
- The day before? - Two days ago?

1348
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:15,970
The day before yesterday.

1349
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:17,610
The day before yesterday?

1350
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:19,410
- The day before yesterday? - The day before yesterday?

1351
00:49:19,413 --> 00:49:21,380
- Two days ago? - Yes.

1352
00:49:21,381 --> 00:49:23,350
- I see. - He meant two days ago.

1353
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,780
- The day before yesterday. - That's right.

1354
00:49:24,785 --> 00:49:26,110
After yesterday is today.

1355
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:28,320
- After yesterday is today, right? - Gosh.

1356
00:49:28,322 --> 00:49:30,490
- Is it because I'm too handsome? - No.

1357
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,590
(His answer is direct.)

1358
00:49:32,593 --> 00:49:34,260
I couldn't hear very well.

1359
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:36,490
- Is that so? - You spoke too loudly.

1360
00:49:36,496 --> 00:49:38,760
I'm sorry.

1361
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:39,900
Do your ears hurt?

1362
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
How can he call himself too handsome?

1363
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:44,300
People say that often. People are surprised...

1364
00:49:44,304 --> 00:49:46,795
- by my looks in person. - That's an exaggeration.

1365
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:49,695
- Kwang Soo, in person... - Yes?

1366
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,280
(How do I look in person?)

1367
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,010
(Kwang Soo looks terrible too, right?)

1368
00:49:58,018 --> 00:50:00,720
You look different in person.

1369
00:50:00,721 --> 00:50:02,950
(You look different in person.)

1370
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:04,305
What?

1371
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:06,720
Did I misunderstand?

1372
00:50:06,727 --> 00:50:08,220
- How does he look? - Why?

1373
00:50:08,228 --> 00:50:09,660
- What do you mean? - Does he look so ordinary?

1374
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:11,385
- Yes. - I see.

1375
00:50:11,765 --> 00:50:13,360
He looked handsome on TV.

1376
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:15,860
- What about now? - It means that you don't in person.

1377
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:18,070
He looks like a regular tourist here.

1378
00:50:18,071 --> 00:50:19,425
(You look ordinary.)

1379
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,440
(He's complimenting on his ordinary looks.)

1380
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:23,640
- It's a compliment. - Is it?

1381
00:50:23,644 --> 00:50:25,070
- Of course. - It's a big compliment.

1382
00:50:25,078 --> 00:50:27,410
It's a compliment that you look ordinary.

1383
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:28,510
Thank you.

1384
00:50:28,515 --> 00:50:30,805
You seem quite witty.

1385
00:50:31,051 --> 00:50:33,450
- Let's go there first. - Okay.

1386
00:50:33,453 --> 00:50:34,680
We'll take a look.

1387
00:50:34,688 --> 00:50:36,845
Gosh, let's look first.

1388
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,820
How bad is it?

1389
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:41,015
Please come this way.

1390
00:50:41,461 --> 00:50:44,715
(They approach the skywalk with confidence.)

1391
00:50:45,432 --> 00:50:47,500
- It's made of glass. - Is it?

1392
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:48,885
(What's this?)

1393
00:50:49,303 --> 00:50:51,025
Are there 24 of them?

1394
00:50:51,071 --> 00:50:54,970
If you succeed, 24 gets subtracted.

1395
00:50:54,975 --> 00:50:57,840
(They must clean the glass floor over the sea.)

1396
00:50:57,844 --> 00:51:00,180
It's okay up to here. There's something underneath.

1397
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,780
- You're right. - There's something here.

1398
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:03,050
There are rocks.

1399
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,950
We can clean this part.

1400
00:51:04,951 --> 00:51:06,535
There are rocks.

1401
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,650
You must wear these.

1402
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:10,745
- Overshoes? - Okay.

1403
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:13,090
The total must be 28.

1404
00:51:13,093 --> 00:51:14,160
Right.

1405
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:15,760
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin put on the shoes.)

1406
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:17,360
We can clean up to here.

1407
00:51:17,364 --> 00:51:19,590
Put the shoes on, Kwang Soo. What else will you do?

1408
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,700
(He gets strategic.)

1409
00:51:22,703 --> 00:51:24,670
I'll take a look around.

1410
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:26,340
Put them on. You have nothing else to do.

1411
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,740
- Come for now. - Just come.

1412
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:29,240
(Put the shoes on first.)

1413
00:51:29,242 --> 00:51:30,965
This isn't hard.

1414
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:35,735
(He's confused as to what's going on.)

1415
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:37,680
- This isn't... - The ground is underneath.

1416
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:39,535
Gosh, it's high up.

1417
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,675
- Look at that. - Goodness.

1418
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,890
- Look over there. - I can't go.

1419
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,360
(It's okay up to where the rocks are.)

1420
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,860
I'm sweating.

1421
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:50,515
How can we clean them?

1422
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:53,430
What do we do?

1423
00:51:53,433 --> 00:51:54,800
(How can we clean them?)

1424
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,555
The sea is below us.

1425
00:51:56,803 --> 00:51:59,055
What are you doing? Come here.

1426
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:01,540
(He looks at the floor.)

1427
00:52:01,541 --> 00:52:02,600
(He takes off his overshoes.)

1428
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,410
(I'll just look at the view.)

1429
00:52:05,412 --> 00:52:06,510
- What? - Come here.

1430
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:07,780
- Why? - Why are you taking them off?

1431
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:09,780
- What? - Why are you taking them off?

1432
00:52:09,783 --> 00:52:10,950
Come here.

1433
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:12,810
You need them to clean.

1434
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:14,450
You want to leave soon, right?

1435
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:16,280
- I should leave. - Then you should clean too.

1436
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:18,645
- Why... - Clean the floor.

1437
00:52:18,692 --> 00:52:20,160
- Help us, Kwang Soo. - What?

1438
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,730
You came all the way here. You want to leave soon, right?

1439
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,860
- I have to leave soon. - I know.

1440
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:26,260
This isn't your penalty.

1441
00:52:26,266 --> 00:52:28,030
You're just helping us.

1442
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:29,560
Let's do it together. Help us.

1443
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:31,055
- Then... - Yes.

1444
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:32,570
I will...

1445
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:33,740
(Is this how you'll play?)

1446
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,470
I will clean eight floors.

1447
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:37,810
After that, flick my forehead.

1448
00:52:37,811 --> 00:52:38,840
(Flick my forehead as a return.)

1449
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:40,180
Just once.

1450
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,280
I'll clean here.

1451
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,010
I'll clean four on each side.

1452
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:44,950
- No way. - No.

1453
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:47,820
We should play rock-paper-scissors or something.

1454
00:52:47,821 --> 00:52:49,950
Otherwise, you have to stay here.

1455
00:52:49,956 --> 00:52:51,890
- It'd be funny. - Exactly.

1456
00:52:51,892 --> 00:52:53,360
How shall we divide it?

1457
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,360
That's the most difficult one.

1458
00:52:55,362 --> 00:52:57,730
1, 2.

1459
00:52:57,731 --> 00:53:00,200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1460
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,215
The highest difficulty level is...

1461
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:04,530
- level 3. - Level 3.

1462
00:53:04,538 --> 00:53:05,730
This is level 2 and level 1.

1463
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:07,095
This is...

1464
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:08,640
level two.

1465
00:53:08,642 --> 00:53:10,140
Level three is insane.

1466
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:13,635
Level three is like being in the air.

1467
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:15,080
Okay.

1468
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,340
(How will they assign the levels?)

1469
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:18,110
How about Race of Wits?

1470
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:20,175
No way.

1471
00:53:20,454 --> 00:53:22,720
(Stop playing Race of Wits.)

1472
00:53:22,722 --> 00:53:24,320
Hey, no.

1473
00:53:24,324 --> 00:53:26,350
- Come on. - No way.

1474
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:27,760
Do you like Race of Wits?

1475
00:53:27,761 --> 00:53:28,860
(Please, Kwang Soo.)

1476
00:53:28,862 --> 00:53:30,430
- It's not bad. - Come on.

1477
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,030
(It isn't so bad.)

1478
00:53:32,032 --> 00:53:34,100
- No. - What else would we play?

1479
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,400
- There's nothing else. - It can't be Race of Wits.

1480
00:53:36,403 --> 00:53:38,130
I'll get level three.

1481
00:53:38,138 --> 00:53:40,140
You don't know that. Just play quickly.

1482
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,570
I'll say one.

1483
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:42,640
- Go ahead. - I'll say one.

1484
00:53:42,642 --> 00:53:43,740
Get ready.

1485
00:53:43,743 --> 00:53:45,765
- I'll say one. - Me too.

1486
00:53:45,912 --> 00:53:47,695
Start.

1487
00:53:47,747 --> 00:53:50,550
(Race of Wits starts.)

1488
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:51,550
- 1. - 1.

1489
00:53:51,551 --> 00:53:52,550
I was first.

1490
00:53:52,552 --> 00:53:54,950
(I said it first.)

1491
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:57,150
- I said it first. - We said it simultaneously.

1492
00:53:57,157 --> 00:53:58,990
- The three went at the same time. - It was simultaneous.

1493
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,720
- My goodness. - Let's go again.

1494
00:54:00,727 --> 00:54:02,345
Do it again.

1495
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:04,015
Get ready.

1496
00:54:04,764 --> 00:54:06,160
Start.

1497
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,400
- 1. - 1.

1498
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,800
(It's simultaneous again.)

1499
00:54:08,802 --> 00:54:10,170
- Stop it. - I can't do this.

1500
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,570
- Stop. - I can't do this.

1501
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:12,730
I can't do it either.

1502
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:14,970
It doesn't work. Everyone is saying one.

1503
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:16,000
This game doesn't work.

1504
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:18,010
How about drawing lots?

1505
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:19,240
Let's do that.

1506
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:20,835
- Sir? - Yes.

1507
00:54:21,281 --> 00:54:23,780
Give these out randomly to the three.

1508
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,880
Mix them up randomly.

1509
00:54:25,886 --> 00:54:27,520
Mix them up and hand them out to us.

1510
00:54:27,521 --> 00:54:30,320
(The three part-timers' fates depend on this man.)

1511
00:54:30,323 --> 00:54:32,945
(Please hand out the papers.)

1512
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:36,020
What was that?

1513
00:54:36,029 --> 00:54:38,530
(Throwing)

1514
00:54:38,532 --> 00:54:40,530
- Was this for me? - Sir.

1515
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:42,960
It looked like you were feeding pigeons.

1516
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:45,725
- That startled me. - I automatically picked it up.

1517
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:48,700
- He did a great job. - Let's do this.

1518
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,140
(How's this?)

1519
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:52,470
- What? - Let's show the papers to him...

1520
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:55,965
and decide whether we'll switch or not by watching him. It's clean.

1521
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:57,350
Open the papers in front of you.

1522
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:00,220
- 1, 2... - Don't look at the camera lens.

1523
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,220
I won't. 1, 2, 3.

1524
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:04,320
(They show the levels to him.)

1525
00:55:04,324 --> 00:55:06,090
- All right. - Did you see them?

1526
00:55:06,092 --> 00:55:07,590
- Yes. - Close them.

1527
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:09,220
- Should we close them? - Yes.

1528
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:10,530
Would you like to switch?

1529
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:12,185
(Thinking)

1530
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,400
Would you like to switch?

1531
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:16,055
(Thinking)

1532
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:17,970
(Should I switch with Jae Seok?)

1533
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:20,140
(His face is hard to read.)

1534
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,840
Should I switch with Kwang Soo?

1535
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:22,900
(What does that facial expression indicate?)

1536
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:24,110
Five...

1537
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,195
- Okay. - Okay. Switch.

1538
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,610
You open yours first.

1539
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,180
- Hold on. - 1, 2, 3.

1540
00:55:30,183 --> 00:55:32,280
(Seok Jin was only watching him. What level does he have?)

1541
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:35,975
(It's Level 2.)

1542
00:55:36,056 --> 00:55:37,445
This is not bad.

1543
00:55:37,591 --> 00:55:38,890
We got the extremes.

1544
00:55:38,892 --> 00:55:40,990
(Would you like to switch?)

1545
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:42,945
Level two is not bad.

1546
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:45,885
If Kwang Soo had the bad one, he would have smiled, right?

1547
00:55:46,533 --> 00:55:49,430
(Will Jae Seok take the offer?)

1548
00:55:49,436 --> 00:55:51,070
- Let's switch. - Okay.

1549
00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:52,425
Are you switching?

1550
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:54,470
- You never know. - That's true.

1551
00:55:54,474 --> 00:55:57,570
1 is Level 1 while the other is Level 3. Guys!

1552
00:55:57,577 --> 00:56:00,280
(1 person is closer to land, while the other is closer to the water.)

1553
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:06,765
(Who will be mopping the glass floor above the sea?)

1554
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:08,950
Okay!

1555
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:12,650
(Kwang Soo is Level 1.)

1556
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:15,445
(Okay, this is great!)

1557
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:18,585
(Am I Level 3?)

1558
00:56:19,432 --> 00:56:22,915
(Mopping the glass floor is the best.)

1559
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:27,940
(Let's say we didn't switch.)

1560
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:29,700
What? You two deal with it.

1561
00:56:29,709 --> 00:56:31,465
I like being in the middle.

1562
00:56:31,478 --> 00:56:33,935
- Let me make a suggestion. - Okay. Good.

1563
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,135
If you slap my forehead right now,

1564
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:39,210
we'll mix the papers up and I'll let you pick first.

1565
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,820
- That's great. - Are you giving me a chance?

1566
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,220
Yes. You get to pick again.

1567
00:56:42,222 --> 00:56:45,090
Right. That's great. He's being generous.

1568
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:46,090
(Jae Seok is a coward, so that's a tempting suggestion.)

1569
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:48,760
He needs to be slapped on the forehead twice.

1570
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:50,130
(He has to slap his forehead twice anyway.)

1571
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,490
- If I slap your forehead once... - He'll mix the papers up again.

1572
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:55,030
We'll mix them up, and I'll let you pick again.

1573
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:58,170
This is a great bargain. This is unprecedented.

1574
00:56:58,171 --> 00:56:59,570
- Okay! Good. - Okay.

1575
00:56:59,572 --> 00:57:00,570
(It's a deal.)

1576
00:57:00,573 --> 00:57:01,970
- Of course, you'll accept it. - Good.

1577
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:03,510
I have to slap your forehead over there.

1578
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:05,770
- Where? - By the water.

1579
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:07,180
(By the water on the bridge)

1580
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,040
Go there.

1581
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:12,050
Once I hit you, you'll be in the water. I'll be on land.

1582
00:57:12,052 --> 00:57:14,050
- This sounds fun. - Go.

1583
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:15,320
You'll only need to be slapped one more time.

1584
00:57:15,321 --> 00:57:17,675
- That sounds fun. - I know.

1585
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:19,220
(Halting)

1586
00:57:19,225 --> 00:57:20,860
Just a little bit more.

1587
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:22,660
- By the metal. - Goodness.

1588
00:57:22,662 --> 00:57:24,785
- By the metal. - By the metal. Over there.

1589
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:28,155
This is no joke. You can go this far.

1590
00:57:28,535 --> 00:57:30,900
- This is just water. - There's no time.

1591
00:57:30,904 --> 00:57:33,130
We have to work. You have to go that far.

1592
00:57:33,139 --> 00:57:34,200
A little bit more.

1593
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,900
(He hesitates.)

1594
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:40,125
I've never seen anybody who's so enthusiastic about this.

1595
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,180
(It's time to subtract one slap.)

1596
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:42,910
He has to get slapped on the forehead to leave.

1597
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:46,305
- Every slap is precious. - Right.

1598
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:51,305
(The humiliation I faced for this moment)

1599
00:57:52,292 --> 00:57:56,160
(For two slaps on the forehead,)

1600
00:57:56,162 --> 00:58:02,285
(he went to Busan instead of Seoul.)

1601
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:04,800
(For that one slap on the forehead...)

1602
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:07,840
I never thought I'd be doing this in Ohryuk Island.

1603
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:10,910
(He speaks all of a sudden.)

1604
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:13,580
- Kwang Soo, - This is thrilling.

1605
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,465
- this is significant. - Indeed.

1606
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:18,465
- All right. It's one slap, right? - Yes.

1607
00:58:18,952 --> 00:58:20,820
(This is going to end the cycle of malice from last week.)

1608
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,320
It's just one slap.

1609
00:58:22,322 --> 00:58:25,890
(He'll get 1 out of 2 slaps taken care of.)

1610
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:27,315
One slap.

1611
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,485
(Slapping)

1612
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:32,490
(He aimed accurately.)

1613
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:33,700
(That sounded good too.)

1614
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,155
(Crawling)

1615
00:58:35,802 --> 00:58:37,970
(In the midst of this, Kwang Soo is scared of the sea,)

1616
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,825
(so he runs away on all fours.)

1617
00:58:41,074 --> 00:58:43,000
Hey. He got up in a second.

1618
00:58:43,009 --> 00:58:44,665
(I'm sorry.)

1619
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:47,510
(Kwang Soo takes care of 1 slap.)

1620
00:58:47,514 --> 00:58:51,410
That was the loudest slap I've ever heard.

1621
00:58:51,417 --> 00:58:52,950
- Are you all right? - That was the loudest.

1622
00:58:52,952 --> 00:58:55,150
There was water, so I slapped harder than expected.

1623
00:58:55,155 --> 00:58:57,720
- You'll have calluses on your hand. - I'm sorry.

1624
00:58:57,724 --> 00:58:59,175
Are you all right?

1625
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:02,320
I swear that was the best slap on the forehead...

1626
00:59:02,328 --> 00:59:05,230
- I've seen. - Right? That was really intense.

1627
00:59:05,231 --> 00:59:09,200
(Kwang Soo made history again with this slap.)

1628
00:59:09,202 --> 00:59:11,030
- This is the last chance. - Yes, it is.

1629
00:59:11,037 --> 00:59:12,970
You have to accept the result this time.

1630
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:13,970
Nobody knows.

1631
00:59:13,973 --> 00:59:15,395
(It's time to pick again.)

1632
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:18,010
- Catch them in the air. - What?

1633
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:19,910
- Catch them in the air. - In the air?

1634
00:59:19,913 --> 00:59:21,240
- Okay. Good. - Catch them in the air.

1635
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:23,280
You can see them fall.

1636
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:26,310
(There's no turning back now. This is the last chance.)

1637
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,050
- You have to accept this. - This is the end.

1638
00:59:28,054 --> 00:59:30,080
There are no more chances. We have no time.

1639
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:31,720
- We have to finish and move on. - Right.

1640
00:59:31,724 --> 00:59:33,345
We have to move on.

1641
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,260
(Jae Seok throws the papers.)

1642
00:59:36,262 --> 00:59:39,885
(They are going to take one each.)

1643
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:42,200
(They all want to avoid Level 3. Who has it?)

1644
00:59:42,202 --> 00:59:45,385
I don't know. I just grabbed one in the air.

1645
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:46,730
- We have to accept the result. - This is it.

1646
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:47,740
This is.

1647
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,000
- 1. - 1!

1648
00:59:49,008 --> 00:59:50,000
(They must accept the result whatever it may be.)

1649
00:59:50,009 --> 00:59:51,010
Two!

1650
00:59:51,010 --> 00:59:53,370
(They must accept the result whatever it may be.)

1651
00:59:53,379 --> 00:59:54,380
Three!

1652
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,035
(Who picked Level 3 and will have to stand above the water?)

1653
00:59:59,018 --> 01:00:00,280
This is it.

1654
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:01,280
This is.

1655
01:00:01,287 --> 01:00:02,550
- 1. - 1!

1656
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:03,550
(They must accept the result whatever it may be.)

1657
01:00:03,556 --> 01:00:04,550
Two!

1658
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,920
(They must accept the result whatever it may be.)

1659
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:07,920
Three!

1660
01:00:07,927 --> 01:00:11,575
(Who picked Level 3 and will have to stand above the water?)

1661
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:15,705
(Kwang Soo has Level 3.)

1662
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:19,875
(Seok Jin has Level 1, and Jae Seok has 2. That's not bad.)

1663
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:25,070
(I'm not even supposed to be receiving a penalty.)

1664
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:28,140
(What am I doing in Busan?)

1665
01:00:28,147 --> 01:00:30,450
- Let's start. - We can't do anything about it.

1666
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,425
Level three gets switched between you and me.

1667
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,380
(His forehead hurts, and he's scared to start cleaning.)

1668
01:00:35,388 --> 01:00:37,290
I got level one.

1669
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:39,820
I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1670
01:00:39,826 --> 01:00:41,920
- Here. - Okay. Start cleaning.

1671
01:00:41,928 --> 01:00:43,590
- Please hurry. - We have no time.

1672
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:45,175
- Kwang Soo, there's no time. - Let's go.

1673
01:00:45,198 --> 01:00:46,935
The butterfly effect is enormous.

1674
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:48,830
- Let's go, Kwang Soo. - I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.

1675
01:00:48,835 --> 01:00:51,175
We promised though.

1676
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:54,900
I'm so refreshed.

1677
01:00:54,908 --> 01:00:57,410
- We worked out... - Please pick the next one too.

1678
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,810
and got a massage,

1679
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:01,480
so let's go to a sauna.

1680
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:03,525
(She's nervous.)

1681
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,110
- Do we have to go somewhere? - There's one here.

1682
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:07,680
- Here? - Of course.

1683
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:09,020
(Trust me.)

1684
01:01:09,022 --> 01:01:10,550
- Where's the sauna here? - There's an awesome one.

1685
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:13,960
I'm scared. I'm getting scared now.

1686
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,465
We won't stop.

1687
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:18,575
Let's go!

1688
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:21,705
- This is a vacation! - I'm scared.

1689
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:24,270
- Stop it! - I'm scared.

1690
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:26,530
- I'm scared too. - Jong Kook.

1691
01:01:26,539 --> 01:01:28,640
It's okay. Let's go.

1692
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,810
- Let's go. - Okay. Let's go.

1693
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,970
(They're nervous but follow him regardless.)

1694
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:34,680
Where's the sauna here?

1695
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:37,980
It doesn't have to be hot.

1696
01:01:37,984 --> 01:01:40,425
- What do you mean? - There's...

1697
01:01:40,887 --> 01:01:42,020
Is this what you meant?

1698
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:43,650
Yes. It's a cold sauna.

1699
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:45,450
- What? - It's a cold sauna.

1700
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:49,160
- Really? A cold sauna? - Athletes around the world...

1701
01:01:49,162 --> 01:01:51,830
would submerge their bodies in ice baths...

1702
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:54,500
right after they work out. This is the cold sauna.

1703
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,430
It's great for recovery.

1704
01:01:56,436 --> 01:02:00,375
- Is it refreshing? - You drop the body temperature.

1705
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,155
Men can take up to minus 160°C.

1706
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:05,970
(Their faces feel numb just by looking at it.)

1707
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:07,425
What if you break?

1708
01:02:07,914 --> 01:02:09,040
Does this hurt?

1709
01:02:09,048 --> 01:02:10,580
- What? No. - Does this hurt?

1710
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:12,410
- It's just refreshing. - Is it refreshing or cold?

1711
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:16,150
It's refreshing. It will improve your condition immensely.

1712
01:02:16,155 --> 01:02:20,560
Would the five of you accept this as a sauna?

1713
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,990
- Well... - This is good.

1714
01:02:22,996 --> 01:02:24,990
This is much better than the regular saunas. It's refreshing.

1715
01:02:24,998 --> 01:02:28,330
- Have you seen the cold saunas? - Yes.

1716
01:02:28,334 --> 01:02:29,760
It's just like that.

1717
01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:32,830
This is the cold sauna. It's refreshing.

1718
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,370
When we go to the sauna, some people go in...

1719
01:02:36,376 --> 01:02:38,470
and others stay outside to eat snacks.

1720
01:02:38,478 --> 01:02:40,580
You can eat snacks. Of course.

1721
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,840
(They're falling for it.)

1722
01:02:42,849 --> 01:02:44,580
- It's the same thing. - If you think about it...

1723
01:02:44,584 --> 01:02:46,280
Cold sauna makes sense too.

1724
01:02:46,285 --> 01:02:48,965
Yes, it's still a sauna.

1725
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:50,950
- This isn't bad. - Okay.

1726
01:02:50,957 --> 01:02:54,120
- I'll approve this as a sauna. - A cold sauna.

1727
01:02:54,127 --> 01:02:57,190
- Okay! - You can eat some boiled eggs.

1728
01:02:57,196 --> 01:02:58,660
Don't worry, So Min.

1729
01:02:58,664 --> 01:03:00,060
(Trust me, So Min.)

1730
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:02,345
- Do we get sikhye and boiled eggs? - Yes.

1731
01:03:02,368 --> 01:03:04,030
So Min and I'll go get them.

1732
01:03:04,037 --> 01:03:05,575
Okay. The youngest two.

1733
01:03:05,772 --> 01:03:07,215
Then...

1734
01:03:07,407 --> 01:03:09,040
let's sit on the mats.

1735
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,755
I'll bring some.

1736
01:03:11,811 --> 01:03:12,910
(The gentleman brings out the mats.)

1737
01:03:12,912 --> 01:03:14,685
Two should be good.

1738
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:18,980
I've never seen Jong Kook so motivated.

1739
01:03:18,985 --> 01:03:20,850
- He hasn't been this happy... - Look at him walk.

1740
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:22,595
- in a while. - He's light on his feet.

1741
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:24,595
- Look at his face. - We have to hurry.

1742
01:03:24,791 --> 01:03:25,950
- Spread them out. - Okay.

1743
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,060
Let's spread them out.

1744
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,805
He's so bright.

1745
01:03:28,895 --> 01:03:30,090
Okay.

1746
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:31,730
This actually looks like a sauna.

1747
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:36,105
(Our boss is insane! Kook's Sauna)

1748
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:38,275
Do you want a massage?

1749
01:03:38,604 --> 01:03:39,700
We're in a sauna anyway.

1750
01:03:39,705 --> 01:03:41,270
(Free massage)

1751
01:03:41,274 --> 01:03:42,900
- Do I? - Yes.

1752
01:03:42,909 --> 01:03:45,040
- Where are you hurting? - My lower back.

1753
01:03:45,044 --> 01:03:46,970
- I see. - My lower back.

1754
01:03:46,979 --> 01:03:49,540
You just have to loosen your muscles there.

1755
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:51,350
- Is it left or right? - Both.

1756
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,510
Watch. This is great.

1757
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:54,965
I'm serious.

1758
01:03:55,254 --> 01:03:59,135
If you loosen up this part, your back will get better.

1759
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:00,660
- I'm serious. - Jong Kook.

1760
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,020
(His customer is satisfied, so he's happy too.)

1761
01:04:02,028 --> 01:04:03,635
Jong Kook.

1762
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,260
Jong Kook! I'm not kidding.

1763
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:07,460
- Your feet too. - Goodness!

1764
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:09,000
(This is his first customer, so a foot massage is a bonus.)

1765
01:04:09,001 --> 01:04:11,115
(I love it!)

1766
01:04:11,137 --> 01:04:12,500
You have to loosen your feet.

1767
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:15,245
- You should, Haha. - No.

1768
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:17,015
Is this from "Infinite Challenge"?

1769
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:19,315
- What? - Your hair.

1770
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:20,340
This is the hybrid style.

1771
01:04:20,346 --> 01:04:21,340
(He also gets his hair done.)

1772
01:04:21,347 --> 01:04:25,655
(While the first customer is getting a full service...)

1773
01:04:25,685 --> 01:04:28,725
I never thought we'd be coming to a gym.

1774
01:04:29,689 --> 01:04:32,390
You tried to provoke him a lot.

1775
01:04:32,391 --> 01:04:34,220
- To whom? Jong Kook? - Yes.

1776
01:04:34,227 --> 01:04:36,005
I'm going to act up now.

1777
01:04:36,129 --> 01:04:38,575
I tried a few times, and he didn't hit me.

1778
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:42,075
Wait. He'll be shocked once he sees this on TV.

1779
01:04:43,035 --> 01:04:44,130
Edit it out.

1780
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:45,600
(I'm sorry, Jong Kook. I tried to look strong.)

1781
01:04:45,605 --> 01:04:47,345
I want this chocolate milk.

1782
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,040
If you drink that, Jong Kook will...

1783
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,470
- Get it. I can get it for you. - I really want this.

1784
01:04:51,477 --> 01:04:53,840
(They only have 50 dollars. They can't get anything else.)

1785
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,310
- Do I just get one? - Let's share.

1786
01:04:55,314 --> 01:04:56,340
Okay.

1787
01:04:56,349 --> 01:04:58,180
- We have to just in case. - Here are the eggs.

1788
01:04:58,184 --> 01:04:59,210
(They decide to share the milk.)

1789
01:04:59,218 --> 01:05:00,380
Should we get these ones?

1790
01:05:00,386 --> 01:05:02,280
- No, this is stone-baked. - Okay.

1791
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:03,780
The other ones taste better though.

1792
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:05,120
- Sikhye. - This is good.

1793
01:05:05,124 --> 01:05:06,865
Hold on, So Min.

1794
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:08,920
- Can't we get these? - Let's get these.

1795
01:05:08,928 --> 01:05:10,690
Right? Let's get these.

1796
01:05:10,696 --> 01:05:12,560
- We can save some money. - This is stone-baked too.

1797
01:05:12,565 --> 01:05:15,445
Jong Kook will compliment us for this. Get two.

1798
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:17,770
- Six? - Tell him you got them.

1799
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:20,115
- He'll give you credit. - Okay.

1800
01:05:20,907 --> 01:05:22,100
Drink this.

1801
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,115
- Aren't you going to drink it? - I will,

1802
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:25,670
but we have to get rid of the receipt.

1803
01:05:25,678 --> 01:05:26,840
(She pays for it separately so that Jong Kook won't know.)

1804
01:05:26,846 --> 01:05:28,580
- You can do that. - That'll be 4.80 dollars.

1805
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:29,680
(She's so meticulous.)

1806
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:31,410
(They have 43.90 dollars left.)

1807
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:32,825
Hurry and drink this.

1808
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:35,725
Is that right?

1809
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,390
I don't want to drink it.

1810
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:39,665
(He betrays her.)

1811
01:05:40,927 --> 01:05:42,820
- I don't want it. Wait. - You have to drink it.

1812
01:05:42,828 --> 01:05:45,090
- Wait. No, So Min. - Take a sip.

1813
01:05:45,097 --> 01:05:46,260
- I... - Hurry.

1814
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:47,660
Take a sip.

1815
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:49,500
- It's okay. - My bad.

1816
01:05:49,502 --> 01:05:50,770
- Hey. - You.

1817
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,500
- Hurry up. - You hit me.

1818
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:54,200
- Take a sip. Hold on. - Let's walk.

1819
01:05:54,207 --> 01:05:55,700
- You have to drink it first. - Let's walk.

1820
01:05:55,708 --> 01:05:57,410
Take a sip.

1821
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,540
Me first?

1822
01:05:58,544 --> 01:06:00,485
- We have to wait for them. - Do we? Okay.

1823
01:06:00,913 --> 01:06:02,240
Drink it now.

1824
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:03,950
Drink it. You have to.

1825
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,110
- You are so... - Look.

1826
01:06:05,117 --> 01:06:07,880
If you're going to get into trouble, it's better to spare one person.

1827
01:06:07,887 --> 01:06:09,425
Take a sip. Hurry up.

1828
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:11,190
Stop faking it. Drink it.

1829
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:13,960
Drink it, you punk. Hurry up.

1830
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,390
- I'll drink it. - Drink it.

1831
01:06:15,394 --> 01:06:16,560
- I will. - Hurry up.

1832
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:17,690
Okay.

1833
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:19,075
(The one who can't drink and the one who has to make him drink)

1834
01:06:19,365 --> 01:06:20,360
Hurry up.

1835
01:06:20,366 --> 01:06:23,075
(10 minutes later)

1836
01:06:23,636 --> 01:06:25,030
Guys.

1837
01:06:25,037 --> 01:06:27,700
- What is this chocolate milk? - What is this?

1838
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:29,115
- It's So Min. - This wasn't on the list.

1839
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:30,470
She had one.

1840
01:06:30,476 --> 01:06:32,910
Hey, So Min.

1841
01:06:32,912 --> 01:06:34,640
- What is wrong with her? - She was smart though.

1842
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:36,785
You might blame her,

1843
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,410
but we got these eggs.

1844
01:06:38,417 --> 01:06:39,510
(Don't be so harsh on her. The quail eggs were her idea.)

1845
01:06:39,518 --> 01:06:41,020
- This is her idea. - Good job.

1846
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:42,180
- So Min, they're okay. - Good job.

1847
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:43,520
Come in. You're good.

1848
01:06:43,522 --> 01:06:45,690
- She had this. - Come in.

1849
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:49,220
Okay. Let's get in the sauna.

1850
01:06:49,228 --> 01:06:50,490
We have to get going.

1851
01:06:50,496 --> 01:06:53,360
- Did you want to go? - Well...

1852
01:06:53,366 --> 01:06:56,105
I usually lie down on the floor when I go to the sauna.

1853
01:06:56,135 --> 01:06:57,430
Same here.

1854
01:06:57,436 --> 01:06:58,870
Let's go.

1855
01:06:58,871 --> 01:07:00,700
You have to put these on. Get changed...

1856
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:02,385
and put these on. You have to put on a gown.

1857
01:07:03,075 --> 01:07:04,070
(You have to wear fur boots?)

1858
01:07:04,076 --> 01:07:05,070
Do I have to put those on?

1859
01:07:05,077 --> 01:07:06,670
How cold is it?

1860
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:08,080
(How cold is it?)

1861
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,740
- Jong Kook, you go first. - Me?

1862
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,710
- We want to watch you first. - I've done it many times.

1863
01:07:11,717 --> 01:07:13,180
Show us what it is.

1864
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:15,625
Okay. I wanted to do it.

1865
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:17,050
(What kind of a sauna is this?)

1866
01:07:17,056 --> 01:07:19,250
Is this cooled down already?

1867
01:07:19,258 --> 01:07:20,450
It needs to be cooled.

1868
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:21,720
The temperature dropped.

1869
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,435
It's minus 180°C... It's minus 174°C. Oh, dear.

1870
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:28,700
(Do you go in minus 180°C with no clothes on?)

1871
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:29,830
Oh, my goodness.

1872
01:07:29,835 --> 01:07:31,270
It's getting cooled down.

1873
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,800
(Jong Kook is used to this, so he's relaxed.)

1874
01:07:33,806 --> 01:07:35,040
Is minus 170°C good?

1875
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:36,300
Is that minus 170°C?

1876
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:38,070
(This is not the sauna I imagined.)

1877
01:07:38,077 --> 01:07:40,255
This is great for improving your condition.

1878
01:07:40,546 --> 01:07:45,095
(The door to the world of ice opens.)

1879
01:07:45,451 --> 01:07:51,250
(There's thick smoke, and Jong Kook goes in.)

1880
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:52,795
This is great.

1881
01:07:55,461 --> 01:07:58,905
- Does it start at minus 160°C? - What?

1882
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:01,445
He can handle up to minus 180°C.

1883
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:03,260
Is this what athletes do?

1884
01:08:03,269 --> 01:08:04,700
Yes, like Cristiano Ronaldo.

1885
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:06,530
This is what he does.

1886
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:07,700
It's decreasing more.

1887
01:08:07,707 --> 01:08:09,985
He's doing what Cristiano does.

1888
01:08:10,876 --> 01:08:12,485
It's minus 180°C, Jong Kook.

1889
01:08:12,945 --> 01:08:14,910
- Are you all right? - Yes.

1890
01:08:14,914 --> 01:08:16,355
This is great.

1891
01:08:17,016 --> 01:08:18,110
- Is it good? - Yes.

1892
01:08:18,117 --> 01:08:19,825
I can feel it on my skin.

1893
01:08:19,919 --> 01:08:21,120
This is what I'm talking about.

1894
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,020
This is a great vacation for him.

1895
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:24,550
(This is great for Jong Kook.)

1896
01:08:24,557 --> 01:08:26,050
It's prickly.

1897
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:28,390
(We don't need to go to a hotel. This is a sauna vacation.)

1898
01:08:28,394 --> 01:08:29,835
I'm serious.

1899
01:08:30,696 --> 01:08:31,890
My hairs are frozen.

1900
01:08:31,897 --> 01:08:34,105
- I'll give him the gown. - My hairs are frozen.

1901
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:37,930
- Your arms... - They're shiny. They're frozen.

1902
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:39,400
Hurry.

1903
01:08:39,405 --> 01:08:40,600
- Hey. - Goodness.

1904
01:08:40,606 --> 01:08:42,040
(He opens the door.)

1905
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:43,715
His buttocks are so high.

1906
01:08:43,776 --> 01:08:45,410
Goodness.

1907
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:47,340
Why do you only show this on "Mom's Diary"?

1908
01:08:47,346 --> 01:08:49,510
(He finishes by flashing his muscular back.)

1909
01:08:49,515 --> 01:08:51,095
Close it.

1910
01:08:51,417 --> 01:08:53,110
This is good. You showed it on Running Man too.

1911
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,380
(Jong Kook's sauna is endlessly generous.)

1912
01:08:55,388 --> 01:08:56,950
- Who's next? - I'll go.

1913
01:08:56,956 --> 01:08:58,695
All right. Let's go!

1914
01:08:58,991 --> 01:09:00,965
Haha! Don't do it!

1915
01:09:01,093 --> 01:09:02,320
Don't do this!

1916
01:09:02,328 --> 01:09:04,390
I'm serious, Haha.

1917
01:09:04,397 --> 01:09:06,290
Please, Haha.

1918
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:07,360
Don't do it.

1919
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:08,960
No, you're almost there.

1920
01:09:08,968 --> 01:09:10,430
- How many seconds do I have? - You're almost there.

1921
01:09:10,436 --> 01:09:11,970
How many seconds do I have?

1922
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:13,530
Tell me!

1923
01:09:13,539 --> 01:09:15,170
- This is good. - Don't talk down to me.

1924
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:16,470
(He's flustered.)

1925
01:09:16,475 --> 01:09:18,710
(It's the personal trainer's fault.)

1926
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:20,485
(I'm so sorry.)

1927
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:23,485
(He doesn't even have the gown on.)

1928
01:09:24,617 --> 01:09:27,965
(What did I just see?)

1929
01:09:29,488 --> 01:09:32,265
Put this on.

1930
01:09:32,358 --> 01:09:34,320
(I'm sorry for not protecting you.)

1931
01:09:34,326 --> 01:09:37,120
Take your hands out. Good.

1932
01:09:37,129 --> 01:09:38,490
- You're going down to minus 160°C. - I'm in so much pain.

1933
01:09:38,497 --> 01:09:40,360
- No, you're good. - Go down to minus 160.

1934
01:09:40,366 --> 01:09:41,560
For goodness' sake.

1935
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:42,960
(As the temperature drops, he turns more vulgar.)

1936
01:09:42,968 --> 01:09:44,700
- I'm in so much pain. - You're not.

1937
01:09:44,703 --> 01:09:47,600
- It's okay. Take your hands out. - I'm in so much pain!

1938
01:09:47,606 --> 01:09:49,600
- I'm in pain. - Take your hands out.

1939
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:51,615
- Right. - I did. Don't you see them?

1940
01:09:52,478 --> 01:09:54,880
- Stay like that. - Hurry.

1941
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,140
- 10 more seconds. - 10 seconds.

1942
01:09:56,148 --> 01:09:57,595
Stop lying.

1943
01:09:59,118 --> 01:10:00,210
Really?

1944
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:01,620
(His lips are frozen.)

1945
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,125
Come out, kid.

1946
01:10:04,356 --> 01:10:06,995
(She's the only one not laughing.)

1947
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,335
(This is not the vacation I dreamed of.)

1948
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:19,500
(I wanted to relax somewhere warm.)

1949
01:10:19,505 --> 01:10:20,700
- I... - Go in, So Min. Hurry.

1950
01:10:20,706 --> 01:10:22,370
- Go in. - This is not the right sauna.

1951
01:10:22,374 --> 01:10:23,470
Just go in.

1952
01:10:23,476 --> 01:10:24,610
I'm so cold.

1953
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:27,485
- It's minus 127°C. - I'm cold.

1954
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:30,655
- It's below minus 100°C. - I'm so cold.

1955
01:10:31,217 --> 01:10:32,810
- This is refreshing. - Really?

1956
01:10:32,818 --> 01:10:34,125
Right?

1957
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,480
(She gets used to the cold.)

1958
01:10:35,488 --> 01:10:36,680
This is refreshing.

1959
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:39,350
(She's enjoying it now.)

1960
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:41,005
There's smoke coming out from her mouth.

1961
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:42,790
This is refreshing.

1962
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:44,160
- I feel younger. - Do you?

1963
01:10:44,163 --> 01:10:45,675
I feel younger.

1964
01:10:45,764 --> 01:10:47,845
My legs... They're prickly.

1965
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:49,660
It's over.

1966
01:10:49,668 --> 01:10:51,430
(Team Seoul completes the second item on their agenda.)

1967
01:10:51,437 --> 01:10:54,685
(Success)

1968
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,840
(Meanwhile, on the skywalk at Ohryuk Island, Busan)

1969
01:10:58,844 --> 01:11:00,540
- Come over here. - Okay.

1970
01:11:00,546 --> 01:11:01,985
(They start cleaning.)

1971
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:05,250
- Take this... - Yes.

1972
01:11:05,251 --> 01:11:07,680
and wipe off the moisture.

1973
01:11:07,686 --> 01:11:09,420
You point down.

1974
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,450
You remove the water through the gap.

1975
01:11:11,457 --> 01:11:13,650
- Level one is the easiest. - Is it?

1976
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:15,120
You can start. Two of you,

1977
01:11:15,127 --> 01:11:17,235
get the clothes.

1978
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:19,705
- Remove the moisture. - All right.

1979
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:22,700
(He's slow.)

1980
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:24,000
Remove the moisture.

1981
01:11:24,003 --> 01:11:26,375
- Use more force. - Okay.

1982
01:11:27,406 --> 01:11:29,200
Go farther.

1983
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:32,270
- You can't leave any moisture. - I know.

1984
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:34,740
- He doesn't clean at home, right? - No, he doesn't.

1985
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:37,210
- I knew it. - Right.

1986
01:11:37,216 --> 01:11:39,980
(He can't deny it.)

1987
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:42,525
Hurry up. You have to cover the whole area.

1988
01:11:43,222 --> 01:11:45,895
(Honey, I'll do better.)

1989
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:48,090
Start wiping this area first.

1990
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:49,220
Here first?

1991
01:11:49,228 --> 01:11:50,690
(They start wiping the glass.)

1992
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:52,330
(They're gathered around the first tile.)

1993
01:11:52,331 --> 01:11:53,835
This...

1994
01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:57,875
(Wiping)

1995
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:01,545
This...

1996
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:06,070
I can't help but look down.

1997
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:08,355
- I can't help it either. - Right?

1998
01:12:08,647 --> 01:12:11,795
This system was set up so that you have to look.

1999
01:12:11,884 --> 01:12:13,050
I'm in trouble.

2000
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:15,180
- Excuse me. Go down there. - I...

2001
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:16,450
6th and 7th tiles.

2002
01:12:16,455 --> 01:12:18,795
Excuse me. Go down there.

2003
01:12:18,924 --> 01:12:20,050
(There?)

2004
01:12:20,059 --> 01:12:22,020
Seok Jin will do 1, 2, and 3.

2005
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:23,935
I'll do this one.

2006
01:12:24,196 --> 01:12:26,690
(I can't go.)

2007
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:28,060
Goodness.

2008
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,145
- Keep going. - This is driving me nuts.

2009
01:12:30,469 --> 01:12:31,975
Oh, gosh.

2010
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:34,515
This is the Maginot Line.

2011
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:38,755
(You come across the edge of the cliff.)

2012
01:12:40,646 --> 01:12:42,125
What should I do?

2013
01:12:42,247 --> 01:12:43,710
It's fine up to here.

2014
01:12:43,716 --> 01:12:45,110
(Level 2 is fine.)

2015
01:12:45,117 --> 01:12:48,625
(Kwang Soo can't even get to Level 3.)

2016
01:12:48,787 --> 01:12:49,980
(How's Seok Jin doing in Level 1?)

2017
01:12:49,989 --> 01:12:52,495
Oh, gosh. Goodness.

2018
01:12:53,826 --> 01:12:56,505
(Is Level 1 easy?)

2019
01:12:56,595 --> 01:12:57,660
(Wiggling)

2020
01:12:57,663 --> 01:12:59,605
It's fine up to here.

2021
01:13:00,299 --> 01:13:03,060
(If you keep going,)

2022
01:13:03,068 --> 01:13:06,000
(you reach the end of the cliff.)

2023
01:13:06,005 --> 01:13:08,585
1, 2, 3, 4.

2024
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:11,185
This is the end of the 8th tile.

2025
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:12,470
This is the end.

2026
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:13,740
I did the eight tiles.

2027
01:13:13,746 --> 01:13:14,780
(He completes the task.)

2028
01:13:14,780 --> 01:13:17,055
(They are jealous.)

2029
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:20,225
(He moves hurriedly.)

2030
01:13:20,919 --> 01:13:22,765
Gosh, that was easy.

2031
01:13:22,988 --> 01:13:24,495
Level one was easy.

2032
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,295
Okay.

2033
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,505
- I am done. - Don't look down.

2034
01:13:29,028 --> 01:13:31,635
(His back is hunched.)

2035
01:13:32,498 --> 01:13:35,360
(It's the blood-chilling Level 3.)

2036
01:13:35,367 --> 01:13:39,275
(I don't know how I will go there.)

2037
01:13:40,706 --> 01:13:45,355
(He first removes water with a mop.)

2038
01:13:46,278 --> 01:13:47,780
- This is no joke. - I am going to die.

2039
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,940
(There is only the sea below his feet.)

2040
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:51,250
I don't think I can do this.

2041
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:52,310
(He feels helpless.)

2042
01:13:52,317 --> 01:13:56,680
(It's impossible for Kwang Soo to enter Level 3.)

2043
01:13:56,689 --> 01:13:59,195
(Shall I muster up my courage?)

2044
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:00,850
(How is Jae Seok doing with Level 2?)

2045
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:02,090
This really is a part-time job.

2046
01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:04,760
(He mops the tiles diligently.)

2047
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:08,205
(He looks like he is on "Real Life Experience".)

2048
01:14:10,269 --> 01:14:12,775
The tiles became really clean.

2049
01:14:13,405 --> 01:14:16,715
(Jae Seok is almost done with 8 glass tiles.)

2050
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,415
(Hesitant)

2051
01:14:20,779 --> 01:14:22,685
It's so scary here.

2052
01:14:22,948 --> 01:14:25,010
It feels really different when you go over there.

2053
01:14:25,017 --> 01:14:26,980
I wouldn't be able to go over there.

2054
01:14:26,985 --> 01:14:28,795
(Welcome to the seaside cliff.)

2055
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:34,290
(Only 8 glass tiles of Level 3 remain at this point.)

2056
01:14:34,293 --> 01:14:36,665
(Scrubbing)

2057
01:14:36,962 --> 01:14:40,005
(He spends 5 minutes on the 1st tile.)

2058
01:14:40,966 --> 01:14:42,860
(He has no intention of moving forward.)

2059
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:44,630
Hurry up.

2060
01:14:44,636 --> 01:14:46,230
Kwang Soo, I have an idea.

2061
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:47,745
(You aren't getting anywhere.)

2062
01:14:48,874 --> 01:14:50,600
Work without looking.

2063
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:53,485
(Without looking?)

2064
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:56,485
(Like this?)

2065
01:14:57,616 --> 01:14:59,080
(What is he doing?)

2066
01:14:59,084 --> 01:15:00,550
Kwang Soo, you can do this.

2067
01:15:00,552 --> 01:15:02,325
- What? - Do this.

2068
01:15:02,554 --> 01:15:04,950
(Like this?)

2069
01:15:04,957 --> 01:15:06,520
Mop like this, Kwang Soo.

2070
01:15:06,525 --> 01:15:08,590
(His eyes are open, but they don't see anything.)

2071
01:15:08,594 --> 01:15:09,790
Don't look.

2072
01:15:09,795 --> 01:15:10,990
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

2073
01:15:10,996 --> 01:15:12,890
Don't look. Don't look.

2074
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:14,190
- Look down. - No.

2075
01:15:14,199 --> 01:15:15,700
Kwang Soo, don't look.

2076
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:17,375
Kwang Soo, don't look. That's it.

2077
01:15:17,503 --> 01:15:18,730
Kwang Soo, don't look.

2078
01:15:18,737 --> 01:15:21,045
This is why you should pick well.

2079
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:23,200
I can't believe him.

2080
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:24,340
What?

2081
01:15:24,343 --> 01:15:27,880
Kwang Soo is helping us even though this isn't his penalty.

2082
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:28,910
What about it?

2083
01:15:28,914 --> 01:15:30,310
"What about it?"

2084
01:15:30,315 --> 01:15:31,710
You should come and help.

2085
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:34,225
You should go farther down. Why aren't you moving an inch?

2086
01:15:34,486 --> 01:15:36,480
You can't go farther down.

2087
01:15:36,488 --> 01:15:37,790
Kwang Soo.

2088
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:39,350
My heart is there with you.

2089
01:15:39,358 --> 01:15:40,695
(Kwang Soo is the only one at Level 3.)

2090
01:15:40,859 --> 01:15:42,660
(He moves his limbs in solitude.)

2091
01:15:42,661 --> 01:15:44,035
Give it to me.

2092
01:15:44,396 --> 01:15:46,130
(The second most timid man comes to help the timidest man.)

2093
01:15:46,131 --> 01:15:47,290
- This is no joke. - I will wipe without looking.

2094
01:15:47,299 --> 01:15:49,045
I will wipe without looking.

2095
01:15:49,368 --> 01:15:51,870
(The two timid men switch places.)

2096
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:54,145
(His neck is stiff.)

2097
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:56,200
(Dragging)

2098
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:57,500
Jae Seok.

2099
01:15:57,509 --> 01:15:59,510
- You didn't wipe the tiles. - You removed a lot of water.

2100
01:15:59,511 --> 01:16:01,240
- You removed a lot of water. - I did, right?

2101
01:16:01,246 --> 01:16:02,685
You removed a lot of water.

2102
01:16:02,915 --> 01:16:04,880
Move closer to the inner wall.

2103
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:06,210
(He moves closer.)

2104
01:16:06,218 --> 01:16:07,625
That's good.

2105
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:10,695
- It's not working. - Jae Seok, it's not working.

2106
01:16:11,156 --> 01:16:13,265
- Really? - Yes.

2107
01:16:13,959 --> 01:16:15,365
I will do it.

2108
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,160
(He steps forward confidently...)

2109
01:16:17,162 --> 01:16:18,190
(and looks into the distance.)

2110
01:16:18,197 --> 01:16:20,035
Move closer to the inner wall.

2111
01:16:20,499 --> 01:16:21,700
This is driving me crazy.

2112
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,705
(Screaming)

2113
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:26,715
(Waddling)

2114
01:16:27,372 --> 01:16:31,470
(The three timid brothers find it hard to mop the floor.)

2115
01:16:31,476 --> 01:16:33,115
Is there a better way?

2116
01:16:42,588 --> 01:16:44,650
(He sinks to the floor...)

2117
01:16:44,656 --> 01:16:46,720
(and wipes the floor as if he is moonwalking.)

2118
01:16:46,725 --> 01:16:48,120
- That's good. - That's good.

2119
01:16:48,126 --> 01:16:50,160
He is like a machine.

2120
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:52,190
- That's perfect. - That's good.

2121
01:16:52,197 --> 01:16:53,990
You are doing a good job, Kwang Soo.

2122
01:16:53,999 --> 01:16:55,460
My goodness.

2123
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,830
(The timidest man is doing a good job.)

2124
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:58,370
- That's good. - That's good.

2125
01:16:58,370 --> 01:16:59,800
- That's good. - You are doing a good job.

2126
01:16:59,805 --> 01:17:01,540
- Don't look down. - Keep going.

2127
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,900
Don't look down.

2128
01:17:02,908 --> 01:17:04,770
That's right.

2129
01:17:04,776 --> 01:17:06,510
That's good. Don't even blink.

2130
01:17:06,511 --> 01:17:07,640
That's good.

2131
01:17:07,646 --> 01:17:08,740
Don't think about anything.

2132
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:09,880
(He forgets to blink.)

2133
01:17:09,882 --> 01:17:12,050
That's good. Don't look down. Don't look down.

2134
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,620
Come this far. It's okay.

2135
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:16,965
- There you go. - Kwang Soo.

2136
01:17:16,989 --> 01:17:18,635
You can wipe like this.

2137
01:17:21,026 --> 01:17:22,520
Kwang Soo, this is a good idea.

2138
01:17:22,527 --> 01:17:24,890
Gosh, you are pathetic.

2139
01:17:24,897 --> 01:17:27,135
Kwang Soo, this is a good idea.

2140
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,060
- Wipe like this. - I didn't wipe the frames.

2141
01:17:29,067 --> 01:17:30,830
Hold on. I will wipe the frames.

2142
01:17:30,836 --> 01:17:34,100
I will wipe the frames. I can do it like this.

2143
01:17:34,106 --> 01:17:37,385
(He cleans the glass tiles with a rag and a vest.)

2144
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:38,770
(Let me try it.)

2145
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:40,315
My goodness.

2146
01:17:42,547 --> 01:17:45,050
It calms your mind, right?

2147
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:46,780
I feel fine because I don't see anything.

2148
01:17:46,785 --> 01:17:49,025
(They begin to clean lying down.)

2149
01:17:49,888 --> 01:17:51,895
(Lying down)

2150
01:17:52,057 --> 01:17:53,495
Is there still water?

2151
01:17:53,659 --> 01:17:55,220
It's right there.

2152
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:57,090
It's right beneath your head.

2153
01:17:57,095 --> 01:17:58,390
There you go.

2154
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,660
A little to the left. That's good.

2155
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:02,060
That's good.

2156
01:18:02,067 --> 01:18:03,930
That's good. That's good.

2157
01:18:03,936 --> 01:18:05,970
That's good. Jae Seok.

2158
01:18:05,971 --> 01:18:08,540
Clean the tiles like Kwang Soo.

2159
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:10,045
Kwang Soo is doing an amazing job.

2160
01:18:10,509 --> 01:18:13,010
(Like a mermaid swimming towards her dream,)

2161
01:18:13,011 --> 01:18:15,940
That's good. That's good. That's good.

2162
01:18:15,948 --> 01:18:18,250
(he kicks his feet against the glass tiles.)

2163
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:19,410
Kwang Soo is doing an amazing job.

2164
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:22,625
(Kwang Soo, the mermaid)

2165
01:18:22,788 --> 01:18:25,050
That's good. That's good.

2166
01:18:25,057 --> 01:18:27,050
That's how you should do it.

2167
01:18:27,059 --> 01:18:29,265
(I want this to end.)

2168
01:18:29,795 --> 01:18:32,160
The task will be over when the two of you meet.

2169
01:18:32,164 --> 01:18:34,490
- That's it. - That's good.

2170
01:18:34,499 --> 01:18:36,060
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2171
01:18:36,068 --> 01:18:37,500
The two of you met.

2172
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:39,575
You cleaned all the glass tiles. They became clean.

2173
01:18:39,738 --> 01:18:41,200
I will wipe the frames one last time.

2174
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:42,370
They are perfect.

2175
01:18:42,374 --> 01:18:43,370
(This is the end.)

2176
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:44,770
You are done. Get up.

2177
01:18:44,776 --> 01:18:48,240
I cleaned the frames.

2178
01:18:48,246 --> 01:18:49,240
He says we are done.

2179
01:18:49,247 --> 01:18:50,580
- Don't look down. - Don't look down.

2180
01:18:50,582 --> 01:18:52,295
- We need to go. - Don't look down.

2181
01:18:53,819 --> 01:18:54,820
Okay.

2182
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:58,095
All right. Hurry up and go. Hurry up and go. Hurry up and go.

2183
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:00,820
(He hurries over.)

2184
01:19:00,826 --> 01:19:01,960
Hurry up and go.

2185
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,435
Kwang Soo, grab this.

2186
01:19:03,462 --> 01:19:04,890
Grab this.

2187
01:19:04,896 --> 01:19:06,760
Hurry up and go.

2188
01:19:06,765 --> 01:19:07,890
Grab this.

2189
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:11,000
Get the towel. Get the towel.

2190
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:13,000
(The towel?)

2191
01:19:13,005 --> 01:19:14,500
There is another towel.

2192
01:19:14,506 --> 01:19:16,070
It's a bit farther up to the right.

2193
01:19:16,074 --> 01:19:17,900
Move your hand down a little bit.

2194
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,570
There you go.

2195
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:23,310
(The second part-time job finally ends.)

2196
01:19:23,315 --> 01:19:24,950
You can stand up now.

2197
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,010
It's safe here. It's safe here.

2198
01:19:27,019 --> 01:19:28,725
My goodness.

2199
01:19:29,221 --> 01:19:30,480
Jae Seok.

2200
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:31,950
- The tiles are clean. - You are right.

2201
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:33,550
The tiles became really clean.

2202
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:35,090
(You can enjoy the beautiful views in a scarier way.)

2203
01:19:35,093 --> 01:19:36,660
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2204
01:19:36,661 --> 01:19:39,760
(The glass floors are 300-percent transparent.)

2205
01:19:39,765 --> 01:19:41,975
- We did a good job, right? - Yes.

2206
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:43,660
- My goodness. - I became so nervous.

2207
01:19:43,668 --> 01:19:45,515
You should do it again some other time.

2208
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:48,540
Can we come again?

2209
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:49,970
- Come. - Really?

2210
01:19:49,975 --> 01:19:51,040
I will buy you sashimi.

2211
01:19:51,043 --> 01:19:52,170
- Really? - Yes.

2212
01:19:52,177 --> 01:19:53,440
Thank you.

2213
01:19:53,445 --> 01:19:54,780
Thank you for your hard work.

2214
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:56,380
- Thank you. - It was so scary.

2215
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:58,150
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2216
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,555
Thank you for your hard work.

2217
01:20:00,986 --> 01:20:03,780
We have 72 to go.

2218
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:06,695
(The status of 100 in a Day Race: 72 left)

2219
01:20:06,925 --> 01:20:08,460
- Here is the map. - Okay.

2220
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,630
(Let's pick the next part-time job.)

2221
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:12,690
Where should we go?

2222
01:20:12,697 --> 01:20:15,300
It looks like Hari Wharf is close to Ohryuk Island.

2223
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:16,675
Let's go there.

2224
01:20:16,868 --> 01:20:19,575
I hope we won't wipe anything at the wharf.

2225
01:20:19,638 --> 01:20:22,315
- If that's the case... - We already did the wiping.

2226
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,570
In that case, I will...

2227
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,710
No, no.

2228
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,040
You still have one more flick.

2229
01:20:27,045 --> 01:20:28,925
You still need to get flicked on the forehead.

2230
01:20:28,947 --> 01:20:30,540
Stay.

2231
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:32,955
How many do we have left?

2232
01:20:33,318 --> 01:20:35,620
- We worked a lot. - We have 72 left.

2233
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,220
(Despite their hard work, they still have 72 left.)

2234
01:20:37,222 --> 01:20:38,450
This is driving me crazy.

2235
01:20:38,457 --> 01:20:41,020
(They begin to wonder where everything went wrong.)

2236
01:20:41,026 --> 01:20:43,660
Why are we doing this from early in the morning?

2237
01:20:43,662 --> 01:20:45,960
I am yawning so much.

2238
01:20:45,964 --> 01:20:48,035
The part-time jobs are exhausting.

2239
01:20:48,266 --> 01:20:49,860
(They arrive at Hari Wharf.)

2240
01:20:49,868 --> 01:20:51,575
What is this place?

2241
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:53,730
What is this?

2242
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:55,100
- For goodness' sake. - Is that for us?

2243
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:56,500
(At the wharf,)

2244
01:20:56,508 --> 01:20:57,600
(a board with pictures of fish for shoe-throwing greets them.)

2245
01:20:57,609 --> 01:21:00,055
No way. Are we going fishing?

2246
01:21:01,146 --> 01:21:02,785
- What is this? - Are we going fishing?

2247
01:21:02,848 --> 01:21:03,940
Is this the part-time job?

2248
01:21:03,949 --> 01:21:07,025
When will we get done at this rate?

2249
01:21:07,385 --> 01:21:09,450
This is taxing.

2250
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:12,395
You have 72 left.

2251
01:21:12,858 --> 01:21:14,820
For this job,

2252
01:21:14,826 --> 01:21:17,120
you will experience the lives of the fishermen in Busan.

2253
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:18,635
- Hold on. - No!

2254
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:21,060
Can I remain standing here?

2255
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:22,260
- Listen. - Kwang Soo.

2256
01:21:22,267 --> 01:21:24,030
- Leaving won't help you. - What are you going to do there?

2257
01:21:24,035 --> 01:21:26,945
Jong Kook is really mad at you.

2258
01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:29,600
You are better off with us. You aren't doing much anyway.

2259
01:21:29,608 --> 01:21:30,700
I will stay here.

2260
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:32,370
- That's good. - Stay here.

2261
01:21:32,377 --> 01:21:34,255
"You aren't doing much anyway"?

2262
01:21:34,346 --> 01:21:36,580
(I can't believe you said that.)

2263
01:21:36,581 --> 01:21:38,450
My underwear is soaked with sweat.

2264
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:39,710
"You aren't doing much anyway"?

2265
01:21:39,718 --> 01:21:42,480
Both my back and my underwear are wet.

2266
01:21:42,487 --> 01:21:44,550
- Why are they wet? - For goodness' sake.

2267
01:21:44,556 --> 01:21:48,565
This part-time job is...

2268
01:21:48,627 --> 01:21:51,490
net fishing at a fishing village.

2269
01:21:51,496 --> 01:21:53,590
Net fishing? That's different from using a fishing rod.

2270
01:21:53,598 --> 01:21:55,905
That's right. It's not a regular type of fishing.

2271
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:57,360
I haven't tried net fishing.

2272
01:21:57,369 --> 01:21:59,530
- You can get 100kg of fish. - I haven't tried net fishing.

2273
01:21:59,538 --> 01:22:00,900
You haven't, right?

2274
01:22:00,906 --> 01:22:05,340
All of us get seasick terribly.

2275
01:22:05,343 --> 01:22:06,570
- Seriously. - Hold on.

2276
01:22:06,578 --> 01:22:08,985
- This is the worst team. - I won't get on the boat, right?

2277
01:22:09,147 --> 01:22:11,750
- I will wait here. - What are you going to do here?

2278
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:13,380
- You have nowhere to go. - We don't want you to get bored.

2279
01:22:13,385 --> 01:22:14,750
You have nothing to do.

2280
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:17,780
On the board are nine fish species that are in season.

2281
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:22,435
Only the fish species you choose by throwing your shoes...

2282
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:24,160
will be counted for the number.

2283
01:22:24,162 --> 01:22:25,690
(4 flounder and 4 filefish)

2284
01:22:25,697 --> 01:22:27,190
Only the two of you will throw.

2285
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:28,460
- Kwang Soo won't throw it. - That's right.

2286
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:29,530
I won't throw it.

2287
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:31,530
If Kwang Soo throws a shoe...

2288
01:22:31,536 --> 01:22:34,245
and gets the same fish species, we will remove it from your list.

2289
01:22:34,673 --> 01:22:35,700
- Okay. - Kwang Soo won't throw a shoe.

2290
01:22:35,707 --> 01:22:38,670
He is just a helper. He is just...

2291
01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:39,910
- Don't be like that. - Listen.

2292
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:41,780
- Kwang Soo, you... - I will throw one too.

2293
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,140
You don't need to do that.

2294
01:22:43,148 --> 01:22:44,710
If I get a different species...

2295
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:46,480
- If I get a different species... - That would be amazing.

2296
01:22:46,484 --> 01:22:48,380
- That would be amazing. - Throw a shoe.

2297
01:22:48,386 --> 01:22:49,950
- If you get flatfish... - Let's go.

2298
01:22:49,955 --> 01:22:51,565
- Let's go. - Okay.

2299
01:22:54,059 --> 01:22:55,590
- This must be the line. - Yes.

2300
01:22:55,594 --> 01:22:57,460
This is the line. Excuse me. This is the line.

2301
01:22:57,462 --> 01:22:59,835
Hold on. That is obviously the line.

2302
01:22:59,965 --> 01:23:01,800
When I take a step back and watch them,

2303
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,530
I can tell that they are cheaters.

2304
01:23:03,535 --> 01:23:05,930
- This is obviously the line. - Come on.

2305
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:07,900
- Both of you pretended not to know. - You stay out of this.

2306
01:23:07,906 --> 01:23:10,400
- Everyone knows this isn't it. - It's so obvious this is the one.

2307
01:23:10,408 --> 01:23:12,040
- It has to be this one. - Why is there a line here then?

2308
01:23:12,043 --> 01:23:14,140
- That one is too far. - They put tapes on the ground.

2309
01:23:14,145 --> 01:23:16,310
This is where we play our games often.

2310
01:23:16,314 --> 01:23:18,395
(These crafty guys are something else.)

2311
01:23:19,117 --> 01:23:23,480
- You kind of look like a filefish. - What? Are you moving the board?

2312
01:23:23,488 --> 01:23:24,950
You didn't move back to the line, so we'll move this.

2313
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:28,020
- We'll move back then. - Fine, goodness.

2314
01:23:28,026 --> 01:23:29,505
No, it's not that.

2315
01:23:30,128 --> 01:23:31,990
(Gosh, those petty staff members.)

2316
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,805
Goodness, you are too petty.

2317
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,545
- Unbelievable. - Did you just call us petty?

2318
01:23:36,968 --> 01:23:41,300
Excuse me, but what kinds of fish are in season right now?

2319
01:23:41,306 --> 01:23:42,700
- Seok Jin, stay quiet. - Flatfish!

2320
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:44,200
- Sorry? It's flatfish. - Flatfish.

2321
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:46,570
- That will help us a lot. - Flatfish.

2322
01:23:46,578 --> 01:23:49,310
- It's the farthest one. - It's at the corner.

2323
01:23:49,314 --> 01:23:50,840
- That's too far. - It's not that far.

2324
01:23:50,849 --> 01:23:52,410
We can just kick it like this.

2325
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,110
- Let's just do it. - What if it goes out of the board?

2326
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:55,595
- We'll do it again? - We should do it again.

2327
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,050
We'll do it until we get a fish. Kwang Soo.

2328
01:23:58,056 --> 01:24:00,195
We'll begin once you say, "start".

2329
01:24:00,859 --> 01:24:03,135
- Let's do a practice round. - This is just a practice round.

2330
01:24:04,329 --> 01:24:05,735
(Kicking)

2331
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:07,990
- There you go. - We got the filefish.

2332
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:11,175
- Are filefish in season now? - They said sea bass is in season.

2333
01:24:11,503 --> 01:24:13,275
Those three are highest in season now.

2334
01:24:13,471 --> 01:24:14,830
- It's sea bass. - Sea bass.

2335
01:24:14,839 --> 01:24:16,770
- We should have started. - We should've started this.

2336
01:24:16,775 --> 01:24:18,185
(Picking up shoes)

2337
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,910
- It was hard to get that one. - Come on, let me try now.

2338
01:24:20,912 --> 01:24:23,240
When I come back, you keep kicking. Let me try too.

2339
01:24:23,248 --> 01:24:24,740
- Go ahead. - You should try it.

2340
01:24:24,749 --> 01:24:28,055
You look like a local from this area.

2341
01:24:31,856 --> 01:24:34,935
Hold on. Why isn't anyone getting that for me?

2342
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,620
Why isn't anyone getting it for me?

2343
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:39,675
Weren't we going to help each other out?

2344
01:24:40,298 --> 01:24:42,300
(Laughing)

2345
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,300
- Hey, no one but I would do this. - Yes?

2346
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:47,430
- Seok Jin would never do this. - Thank you.

2347
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:49,570
Look at him. He's not moving at all.

2348
01:24:49,574 --> 01:24:52,270
- I'll do it. I'm on a roll. Start. - Start.

2349
01:24:52,277 --> 01:24:53,410
Let me go first.

2350
01:24:53,411 --> 01:24:56,285
(Seok Jin will start first.)

2351
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:01,480
- Darn it. Come on. - It's out of the board.

2352
01:25:01,486 --> 01:25:03,220
(His first attempt goes out of the board.)

2353
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:05,050
- You will try again. - I'll try again.

2354
01:25:05,056 --> 01:25:06,750
(Dashing)

2355
01:25:06,758 --> 01:25:09,220
- Thank you. - He should go get it. Don't go now.

2356
01:25:09,227 --> 01:25:13,160
No, he should exercise when he's young.

2357
01:25:13,164 --> 01:25:16,675
What are you talking about? You've been sleeping up until now.

2358
01:25:16,768 --> 01:25:20,575
- What do you mean I must exercise? - Make him go get his shoe.

2359
01:25:21,005 --> 01:25:23,770
(Seok Jin attempts to use some of his leg muscles.)

2360
01:25:23,775 --> 01:25:26,255
(It's out again.)

2361
01:25:27,579 --> 01:25:29,440
- Hey. - Don't go. No, don't go.

2362
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:31,585
- You should go get it. - You should go, Seok Jin.

2363
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,110
Goodness.

2364
01:25:33,118 --> 01:25:34,755
(You should exercise too. Go get your own shoe.)

2365
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:36,750
(Limping)

2366
01:25:36,755 --> 01:25:39,650
- Hey. - Go faster.

2367
01:25:39,657 --> 01:25:40,920
Move it.

2368
01:25:40,925 --> 01:25:43,505
(He's almost there after forcing himself to walk.)

2369
01:25:43,661 --> 01:25:45,830
- Hey, you jerk. Hey! - Hey.

2370
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:48,105
(I was almost there.)

2371
01:25:48,466 --> 01:25:49,460
You come here.

2372
01:25:49,467 --> 01:25:51,200
(Tossing)

2373
01:25:51,202 --> 01:25:52,470
(Tossing it back)

2374
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:53,970
(Goodness, these punks.)

2375
01:25:53,972 --> 01:25:55,970
- Hey. - You must keep moving.

2376
01:25:55,974 --> 01:25:58,045
- You should exercise. - Give it back.

2377
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:01,925
Hey, you should move more. You need to exercise.

2378
01:26:03,047 --> 01:26:05,610
Kwang Soo and I are trying to help you live a long life.

2379
01:26:05,617 --> 01:26:07,310
- Okay. Start! - Seriously.

2380
01:26:07,318 --> 01:26:08,765
(Seok Jin will try.)

2381
01:26:09,988 --> 01:26:11,480
- He got it. - That's great.

2382
01:26:11,489 --> 01:26:12,490
- Rockfish. - That's great.

2383
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:15,365
(It falls on top of rockfish.)

2384
01:26:15,427 --> 01:26:17,960
- Is rockfish in season? - Is it in season?

2385
01:26:17,962 --> 01:26:20,605
- Okay, we got rockfish. - Great.

2386
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:21,660
Next.

2387
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:23,845
(Jae Seok will try next.)

2388
01:26:24,202 --> 01:26:25,470
I'm aiming for the flatfish.

2389
01:26:25,470 --> 01:26:26,815
(Kicking)

2390
01:26:28,106 --> 01:26:31,770
(Will it fall on top of the flatfish which is everyone's wish?)

2391
01:26:31,776 --> 01:26:32,840
It's flatfish!

2392
01:26:32,844 --> 01:26:34,010
(Going out of the board)

2393
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:36,385
(Please let it be the flatfish. That was so close.)

2394
01:26:36,514 --> 01:26:39,210
Hey, hey! Make Jae Seok go get his.

2395
01:26:39,217 --> 01:26:41,980
You go. Go get your own shoe.

2396
01:26:41,986 --> 01:26:43,380
(He's on his way to get his shoe.)

2397
01:26:43,388 --> 01:26:44,765
(Stealing)

2398
01:26:44,956 --> 01:26:48,135
(He comes and steals the shoe before anyone else does.)

2399
01:26:49,327 --> 01:26:51,490
(Clapping)

2400
01:26:51,496 --> 01:26:52,630
(His Shoe Dance explodes.)

2401
01:26:52,630 --> 01:26:55,200
- That's great. - Kwang Soo.

2402
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,360
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2403
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,500
(Come get your shoe!)

2404
01:26:59,504 --> 01:27:01,840
- Kwang Soo. - Great, great.

2405
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,870
Kwang Soo.

2406
01:27:02,874 --> 01:27:04,770
(He's venting out his anger by playing with Jae Seok's shoe.)

2407
01:27:04,776 --> 01:27:06,870
(Come get your shoe.)

2408
01:27:06,878 --> 01:27:09,585
(They are hilarious.)

2409
01:27:10,215 --> 01:27:11,210
Let's get the flatfish.

2410
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:12,210
(Jae Seok gets his shoe back.)

2411
01:27:12,217 --> 01:27:13,250
Please.

2412
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:15,155
(He will really try now.)

2413
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,565
It's flatfish.

2414
01:27:17,689 --> 01:27:20,150
- It's rock cod. - Is that in season now?

2415
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:22,220
You can catch a lot of rock cod. There are a lot of fish here.

2416
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:24,120
- We can catch a lot of that too? - Yes.

2417
01:27:24,128 --> 01:27:25,120
(Seok Jin: rockfish, Jae Seok: rock cod)

2418
01:27:25,129 --> 01:27:27,060
- Kwang Soo, your turn. - Just don't get the same fish.

2419
01:27:27,065 --> 01:27:29,560
- Okay. - Kwang Soo, aim for the flatfish.

2420
01:27:29,567 --> 01:27:31,545
(If it doesn't overlap, the number of species will go up.)

2421
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,100
(Can Kwang Soo overcome his humiliating past?)

2422
01:27:34,105 --> 01:27:35,600
- Hey, don't get the same fish. - That looked great.

2423
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:40,255
(Will he be able to become a hero after getting the flatfish?)

2424
01:27:42,413 --> 01:27:43,755
(Out of the board)

2425
01:27:43,882 --> 01:27:45,110
It fell on the flatfish.

2426
01:27:45,116 --> 01:27:47,025
- Hey, don't get the same fish. - That looked great.

2427
01:27:47,418 --> 01:27:48,950
- It fell on the flatfish. - Go get it.

2428
01:27:48,953 --> 01:27:50,480
(Rushing)

2429
01:27:50,488 --> 01:27:52,835
(He gets playful again.)

2430
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:54,820
Hold on.

2431
01:27:54,826 --> 01:27:56,220
(Gosh, Jae Seok.)

2432
01:27:56,227 --> 01:27:58,135
Until where are you running?

2433
01:27:59,497 --> 01:28:02,130
Goodness, you're full of energy.

2434
01:28:02,133 --> 01:28:06,215
(Thus began the chase of young guys in broad daylight.)

2435
01:28:09,307 --> 01:28:10,970
Ma'am, take this with you.

2436
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:12,270
- Wait. - Ma'am.

2437
01:28:12,277 --> 01:28:13,710
Ma'am, take this with you.

2438
01:28:13,711 --> 01:28:15,855
(Okay, I got it.)

2439
01:28:16,414 --> 01:28:17,510
Ma'am!

2440
01:28:17,515 --> 01:28:19,110
(This is how the relay race with his shoe began.)

2441
01:28:19,117 --> 01:28:21,425
- Let's shake hands. - Please give it back.

2442
01:28:21,452 --> 01:28:24,325
Ma'am, please give it back. Please let me have it.

2443
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:27,520
- Ma'am, it's sponsored. - Here you go.

2444
01:28:27,525 --> 01:28:28,520
Wait.

2445
01:28:28,526 --> 01:28:29,520
(Kwang Soo's shoe isn't coming back.)

2446
01:28:29,527 --> 01:28:32,690
- That's hilarious. - My stomach hurts.

2447
01:28:32,697 --> 01:28:33,990
(Trudging)

2448
01:28:33,998 --> 01:28:35,460
Kwang Soo, come on. Get the flatfish.

2449
01:28:35,466 --> 01:28:37,730
- It fell on the flatfish once. - We should...

2450
01:28:37,735 --> 01:28:39,700
- We'll be doomed otherwise. - We should go back home now.

2451
01:28:39,704 --> 01:28:42,400
- Okay. Let's end it here. - Please?

2452
01:28:42,407 --> 01:28:44,040
- Let's end it here. - Start.

2453
01:28:44,042 --> 01:28:45,040
(Flatfish will put an end to this.)

2454
01:28:45,043 --> 01:28:46,870
Yours can't fall on the rockfish or the rock cod.

2455
01:28:46,878 --> 01:28:50,755
(Will Kwang Soo be able to put his shoe in the flatfish box?)

2456
01:28:51,816 --> 01:28:56,265
(Please Kwang Soo, get the flatfish!)

2457
01:28:57,689 --> 01:28:59,495
- Flatfish! - Gosh!

2458
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:01,720
(It falls on top of the flatfish.)

2459
01:29:01,726 --> 01:29:04,490
Good job. Great work.

2460
01:29:04,495 --> 01:29:05,690
- Great. - Great. This is it.

2461
01:29:05,697 --> 01:29:07,590
- We can get off work soon. - Kwang Soo, we're good now.

2462
01:29:07,599 --> 01:29:11,645
(They can count the fish if they are rockfish, rock cod, or flatfish.)

2463
01:29:12,604 --> 01:29:15,740
Seasickness is all about your confidence.

2464
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:17,400
(The weakest members brace themselves.)

2465
01:29:17,408 --> 01:29:19,070
There are a lot of fish.

2466
01:29:19,077 --> 01:29:20,585
All right. Let's get on the boat first.

2467
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:22,240
Let's get going now.

2468
01:29:22,246 --> 01:29:23,410
(They set out to the sea with the hope of a full boat.)

2469
01:29:23,414 --> 01:29:24,740
Our part-time jobs are hard today.

2470
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:27,010
I had no idea that we'd be on a boat.

2471
01:29:27,018 --> 01:29:29,465
(What kind of future will unfold on the job?)

2472
01:29:29,754 --> 01:29:34,495
(The ultimate part-time job begins at last.)

2473
01:29:34,759 --> 01:29:36,490
- Gosh. - It's not coming.

2474
01:29:36,494 --> 01:29:38,190
(They endlessly spin...)

2475
01:29:38,196 --> 01:29:40,205
(and continue to reel it up.)

2476
01:29:40,632 --> 01:29:44,205
(But there's no sign of their job ending.)

2477
01:29:44,869 --> 01:29:48,100
(They finally open the mysterious pouch.)

2478
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:49,300
I don't know when it will end.

2479
01:29:49,307 --> 01:29:51,570
(And)

2480
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:53,570
(When the pouch opens,)

2481
01:29:53,578 --> 01:29:55,755
(another game begins.)

2482
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,410
(Some chase.)

2483
01:29:57,415 --> 01:29:59,095
(Some get chased.)

2484
01:29:59,317 --> 01:30:02,250
(A hair-raising twist that no one saw coming)

2485
01:30:02,253 --> 01:30:04,195
(What on earth has happened to them?)

2486
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:08,720
(I was told to open this when things get really hard.)

2487
01:30:08,726 --> 01:30:11,135
(That would be the end of this.)

2488
01:30:11,696 --> 01:30:14,405
