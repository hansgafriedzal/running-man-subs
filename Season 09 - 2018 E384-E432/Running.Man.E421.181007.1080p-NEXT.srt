1
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,155
(Last week)

2
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:12,255
(Jae Seok and Seok Jin went to Busan to receive a penalty.)

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,530
(They must make number 100 by working part-time jobs...)

4
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:16,125
(in 100 in a Day Race.)

5
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:19,995
(One man got dragged to Busan to pay his debt.)

6
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:22,140
(To make number 100,)

7
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:24,610
(the 100-year-old Couple worked hard...)

8
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,335
(with Kwang Soo.)

9
00:00:26,783 --> 00:00:29,945
(Then they went out to the sea for another part-time job.)

10
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:34,045
(Team Seoul got to enjoy a vacation with 50 dollars.)

11
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:35,990
(Jong Kook suggested...)

12
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:38,755
(a new style of vacation at a gym.)

13
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:41,885
(They cycled and enjoyed a cold sauna.)

14
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,300
I feel so refreshed.

15
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,360
You completed the second vacation plan...

16
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:49,530
which involved eating eggs and sikhye at a sauna.

17
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:51,900
Now, three vacation plans...

18
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:54,740
and 43 dollars and 90 cents remain.

19
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:56,740
The 1st 2 plans were cheap.

20
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:58,080
Which plan will you complete next?

21
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,440
- We have three plans left. - An escape room,

22
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,080
- pork belly meat, - Shall we do an escape room next?

23
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:02,810
and surfing remain.

24
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,920
- Let's do an escape room next. - An escape room?

25
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,920
- Surfing. - To do an escape room,

26
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:09,720
we will use our brains...

27
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,920
to solve a crime.

28
00:01:11,928 --> 00:01:14,360
We can do an escape room in any room, right?

29
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:16,490
(He has quick wits.)

30
00:01:16,499 --> 00:01:19,625
- It can be anything we choose. - We didn't set the details.

31
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,270
We can do it in any room.

32
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,370
- An escape room. - The one who removes my name tag...

33
00:01:24,374 --> 00:01:26,235
gets to escape.

34
00:01:26,543 --> 00:01:28,270
Then none of us will escape.

35
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:31,240
- It will go on all night long. - That's how an escape room works.

36
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,180
- I will never escape. - Right?

37
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:36,650
We can decide on the rules later.

38
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:37,820
- Okay. - Whose place is available?

39
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,315
(We need to save money.)

40
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:41,020
- Let's go to your place. - My place?

41
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,615
Let's go to your place.

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,760
- Is it the same place? - What?

43
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,120
Is it the place we visited?

44
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,360
Yes, it is.

45
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:49,830
Is it the place we visited? Let's go there.

46
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:52,630
There were many rooms. There were many.

47
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,470
- Let's go there. - You should ask for my opinion.

48
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,130
(I have human rights.)

49
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,800
You shouldn't talk as if it has been decided.

50
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,040
- Let's go to your place. - When I was single,

51
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:03,040
they used my place four times.

52
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:05,040
We didn't tell him in advance.

53
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:07,810
- Really? Okay. - They used my place.

54
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:08,810
(Then it can't be helped.)

55
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,120
Is there food at home?

56
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Food? Of course, there is.

57
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,015
- Is there pork belly meat at home? - Pork belly meat?

58
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:15,350
I bet there is.

59
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,490
I will look for it. I don't think there is pork belly meat.

60
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:18,560
- We will see. - Maybe it's pork neck meat.

61
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,460
You could ask your brother to buy the meat.

62
00:02:21,464 --> 00:02:23,760
- He isn't home today. - Why?

63
00:02:23,767 --> 00:02:25,400
He works, too.

64
00:02:25,402 --> 00:02:26,660
(My brother works, too.)

65
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:30,225
I see. Let him rest. Tell him to work.

66
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,500
- Okay? - Okay.

67
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,140
- Shall we go to my place? - Let's go to Se Chan's place.

68
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,635
- Okay. - Okay. Let's go.

69
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:38,240
- Let's go and do an escape room. - Okay.

70
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:40,205
I am very happy.

71
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:42,610
Before you go,

72
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:45,650
- I have a notification. - What is it?

73
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:48,290
26 dollars have been deducted from the total amount.

74
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,550
- Why? - Why?

75
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,760
(So suddenly? Why?)

76
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,560
- Why? - Tell us why.

77
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:57,630
We told you the money will be given to the members.

78
00:02:57,634 --> 00:02:59,260
- Did the others use it? - Yes.

79
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,895
(Without any permission?)

80
00:03:01,004 --> 00:03:03,770
- The part-time jobs are exhausting. - Seriously.

81
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:06,535
I will pay for lunch. Enjoy it.

82
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:07,640
Suyuk set.

83
00:03:07,644 --> 00:03:09,240
I will also have the suyuk set.

84
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,905
I will have sundae soup.

85
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,240
I will pay for lunch.

86
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:15,275
Thank you.

87
00:03:15,285 --> 00:03:17,080
I can't believe it.

88
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,145
- Call them. - For goodness' sake.

89
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,250
What did they eat? Perhaps, they ate cold jokbal.

90
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,250
(We are saving up money.)

91
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:24,890
(We must know where they spent the money.)

92
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:26,360
Pick up the phone.

93
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,460
- What are you eating? - Hello.

94
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:30,060
- Hello. - What is that, ssambap?

95
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:32,030
(What are you eating?)

96
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,360
- Kwang Soo. - They are eating.

97
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,370
- Pork gukbap? - They are eating delicious food.

98
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:36,900
We are eating pork gukbap.

99
00:03:36,906 --> 00:03:38,440
- They are eating pork gukbap. - Pork gukbap.

100
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,440
- We ate quail eggs. - We ate quail eggs.

101
00:03:40,443 --> 00:03:42,810
We are saving money.

102
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:46,105
Why would you do that? Eat.

103
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:47,780
(He is...)

104
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:51,245
(really annoying.)

105
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:53,350
- We should use the money quickly. - It seems that way.

106
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,520
If they use up all the money,

107
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,490
- we will have to go to Busan. - We will have to go to Busan.

108
00:03:57,494 --> 00:03:59,890
- We are in a different position. - Be quiet. They don't know that.

109
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,630
- That's right. - They didn't hear me.

110
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,260
- What? - All right.

111
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:07,900
- We are hanging up. - We are hanging up.

112
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,630
We are hanging up. All right.

113
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,070
- Let's go. - How much money do we have left?

114
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,500
- At this rate... - Let's use the money.

115
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,070
Let's eat. I am hungry.

116
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,840
We should use the money. What can we buy with 17 dollars?

117
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:18,610
- Tteokbokki. - Tteokbokki is a good idea.

118
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,380
- Tteokbokki is a good idea. - Let's go.

119
00:04:20,383 --> 00:04:22,280
- Tteokbokki is a good idea. - My goodness.

120
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,350
- Let's go. - Sundae.

121
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:25,650
- They were stuffing their faces. - Seriously.

122
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,550
We must use the money before Kwang Soo does.

123
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:29,620
Shall I order tteokbokki?

124
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,885
- Go ahead. - Let's order it.

125
00:04:32,195 --> 00:04:35,525
- Hello. - I would like the twin set.

126
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:37,930
It's 17 dollars. How would you like to pay?

127
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:39,555
I will pay with cash.

128
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:42,530
Okay. The food will be delivered as soon as it's ready.

129
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,365
- Thank you. - Thank you.

130
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,565
Tteokbokki will be tasty.

131
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:51,640
If we use all the money, how will we get pork belly meat?

132
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:54,475
(By the way)

133
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:57,450
Pork belly meat? Oh, we have to eat pork belly meat.

134
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,175
I forgot about that.

135
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:00,350
(He is relaxed.)

136
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:01,650
We need a favor from a friend.

137
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:03,250
(He is a problem-solver.)

138
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,290
You have...

139
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:07,760
(Jong Kook, the problem-solver, remembers everything.)

140
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:12,260
(He remembers a friend can provide the place and goods.)

141
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:13,900
Whom should we ask?

142
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:17,370
Shall we brainstorm? Does anyone come to mind?

143
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,170
Meat... Meat reminds me of Moon Se Yoon.

144
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:21,610
Se Yoon is a good choice.

145
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,110
- Right. - I also think he is a good choice.

146
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,440
- Se Yoon. - Se Yoon is a good choice.

147
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:26,380
There is also Hwang Je Sung.

148
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:28,280
- Je Sung is a good choice. - Je Sung.

149
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:30,550
- Hwang Je Sung. - I want to meet him in real life.

150
00:05:30,553 --> 00:05:32,050
He is a member of my fan club.

151
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,450
- That's right. - I am a big fan.

152
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:35,250
- Really? - Yes, I am a big fan.

153
00:05:35,258 --> 00:05:37,190
- Je Sung. - Shall I call him later or now?

154
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,660
- Now. - Try calling him.

155
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:40,390
This is cool. I am a big fan.

156
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,860
(They are fans of each other.)

157
00:05:41,864 --> 00:05:43,560
I was going to bring up Je Sung.

158
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:45,760
- We had the same idea. - That's right.

159
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:47,100
(I look after my fan.)

160
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:49,825
- Is he nice? - He is.

161
00:05:50,373 --> 00:05:53,100
- He isn't picking up. - He is good friends with Je Sung.

162
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:55,440
- Se Yoon. - Je Sung didn't pick up.

163
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:57,505
He didn't pick up.

164
00:05:57,981 --> 00:05:59,180
What is he doing?

165
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:01,745
(Let's think of someone.)

166
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:03,605
Let's go.

167
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,020
- Let's go. - That's good.

168
00:06:05,021 --> 00:06:06,020
(Team Busan goes to a wharf after lunch.)

169
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,920
- Rock cod! - Rock cod!

170
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:10,990
- That's good. - I'll introduce the captain...

171
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,020
who will help you fish.

172
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,030
Here comes the captain.

173
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,260
Hello.

174
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:18,525
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

175
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:20,530
- It's nice to meet you. This way. - We are in your care.

176
00:06:20,536 --> 00:06:22,565
- You are a veteran, right? - Yes.

177
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:24,295
Today,

178
00:06:24,374 --> 00:06:26,970
- Please help us. - we have to catch about 72 fish.

179
00:06:26,976 --> 00:06:28,240
- Okay. - Is this possible?

180
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,905
We'll see when we get there and check the nets.

181
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,640
- What do we need to do? - What should we do?

182
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,305
I threw out the nets the day before.

183
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,450
- We just have to reel them up. - Yes.

184
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:39,415
We have to haul up the nets today.

185
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:41,950
- We hit the jackpot. - He did all the work.

186
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,450
- Just help me with those. - Okay.

187
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,420
We're not here to help. We're your part-timers today.

188
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:46,820
- Part-timers? - Yes.

189
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,230
I don't have that much money.

190
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,660
(Is this a joke from a man from Busan?)

191
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,930
- Goodness. - We don't need money.

192
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,500
- We just have to catch fish. - Okay.

193
00:06:52,502 --> 00:06:54,770
We'll put our trust in the captain.

194
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,800
Captain, hasn't it been about 60 years...

195
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,200
since you've been a fisherman?

196
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,540
- Not 60 years. - How long has it been then?

197
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:04,105
What's wrong with you? It's been about 45 years, right?

198
00:07:04,113 --> 00:07:05,380
- Right? I knew it. - Yes, 45 years.

199
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:08,280
- He's very reliable. I can feel it. - I can tell right away.

200
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:09,710
- Captain, let's get started then. - Okay.

201
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,080
- Let's start now. - Okay.

202
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,550
(Captain, please put an end to this torment of part-time jobs.)

203
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:13,850
Put on your life vests.

204
00:07:13,856 --> 00:07:16,390
(They get ready to set sail for net fishing in the village.)

205
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:20,020
Seasickness is all about your confidence.

206
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:21,560
(Lee Kwang Soo, fish-looking man)

207
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:22,990
(Jee Seok Jin, a former navy)

208
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,860
(Yu Jae Seok, claims to be a fishing master)

209
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,200
(Fish in Busan, brace yourselves.)

210
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,700
(The trio of the best fishermen are on board.)

211
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:30,865
This kind of weather is rare.

212
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,170
I can't believe I'm on a boat again.

213
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,740
- Today, - Today's part-time jobs...

214
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,610
it's full of twists and turns.

215
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:37,810
That's what our show is for.

216
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:39,610
(Teasing)

217
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,750
I meant about today.

218
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,375
How exciting.

219
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,220
Anyway,

220
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:47,545
- Bye. - let's catch a lot of fish.

221
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,615
We can catch flatfish, rockfish,

222
00:07:51,094 --> 00:07:52,555
and rock cod.

223
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:57,130
Goodness, today's part-time jobs are hard.

224
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:59,200
- I agree. - It's really exhausting.

225
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:00,600
- How many jobs did we do? - I had no idea...

226
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,300
(They cleaned the windows on top of the cliff.)

227
00:08:02,305 --> 00:08:05,165
I had no idea we'd be on a boat.

228
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,670
- This was your penalty. - Yes, it was.

229
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:10,140
(Why am I here?)

230
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:12,035
You were supposed to carry this out.

231
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:13,735
- Right. - Anyway,

232
00:08:14,417 --> 00:08:16,045
trust me.

233
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,450
Why?

234
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:18,820
(He has 0 confidence in Jae Seok.)

235
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:20,450
You've never done this before.

236
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,145
Don't you know me?

237
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:25,590
I spent a lot of time at the sea.

238
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:27,090
- Stop lying. - If so...

239
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,825
What are you talking about? I'm from the navy.

240
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:32,360
- Unbelievable. - Seriously.

241
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:34,125
(I can't trust these guys.)

242
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,970
(The refreshing autumn breeze washes away their fatigue.)

243
00:08:35,972 --> 00:08:38,400
- It's nice to be out on the waters. - Of course.

244
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,240
- How nice. - The ocean breeze is nice.

245
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,710
I'm glad.

246
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,370
(They arrive at the spot for net fishing.)

247
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,140
- We're at the spot. - Is this the spot?

248
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,240
- Yes. - It's over there.

249
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:48,080
- There it is. - We'll grab the buoys.

250
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:49,910
How many nets do we need to haul up?

251
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,180
- 2. - I see. 2 nets.

252
00:08:51,187 --> 00:08:54,550
Captain, flatfish, rockfish, and rock cod are important to us.

253
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:56,320
- Flatfish, rockfish, and rock cod. - Should we start now?

254
00:08:56,325 --> 00:08:58,020
- Do you see that over there? - Okay.

255
00:08:58,027 --> 00:08:59,720
- Grab the buoy. - Okay.

256
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:00,960
Go, go.

257
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:03,560
- Should I start reeling up? - Yes.

258
00:09:03,566 --> 00:09:05,830
- Do we use that to reel up nets? - Yes, we must reel them up.

259
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,530
- I saw that on TV. - Okay.

260
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:08,870
I've never seen this in person.

261
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:10,800
- Net fishing. - Same here. It's interesting.

262
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:11,970
- Do we need to haul it up? - Yes.

263
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:14,040
- I just turned on the net hauler. - I see. Net hauler.

264
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:15,810
- We'll use the net hauler. - Right.

265
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,040
- Just like this. - It's coming up now.

266
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,210
I guess there are a lot of fish.

267
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:21,180
- Get ready to receive the fish. - Where should we put them?

268
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:22,410
The net will be reeled up.

269
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:23,680
(Isn't that a rock?)

270
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:24,950
- Hold on. Wait. - Gosh.

271
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,915
- Something is hanging. - That's fine.

272
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,460
- What's that? - It holds the nets from floating.

273
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,190
- It weighs them down. - I see. You unload that first.

274
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:34,660
(The weight holds the nets from floating away.)

275
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:37,830
Get moving. Put this rock away.

276
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:39,455
Put it on the bottom.

277
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,625
Keep a lookout for rocks.

278
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,070
- Okay. - Get a grip when you're out here!

279
00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:47,640
(Don't be so clumsy.)

280
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,810
- What do you know? - Hold on a second.

281
00:09:49,812 --> 00:09:52,575
- You don't know anything. - You're just hauling up the net.

282
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:55,375
- Are you playing a tug of war? - Get a grip when you're out here.

283
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:58,245
(You should get a grip, Jae Seok.)

284
00:09:58,855 --> 00:09:59,980
(He keeps pulling.)

285
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,320
Hey, grab this rope.

286
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:02,850
- Be careful. - It's coming. It's coming.

287
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:04,620
- Be careful. - Is it coming?

288
00:10:04,627 --> 00:10:06,885
- It's coming. - Let's see.

289
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,960
Here comes the net!

290
00:10:08,965 --> 00:10:10,730
- Here it comes. - The fish are coming.

291
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,830
(It's their first catch after they started pulling the net.)

292
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:17,800
(They can only count it if it's a flatfish, rockfish, or rock cod.)

293
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,070
A conch is coming up.

294
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,910
(This won't count.)

295
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,370
- A conch? - It's a sea urchin. It's a conch!

296
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:24,710
- Take it out. Take it out. - A conch.

297
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:25,910
- Take out the conch. - Do I take this out?

298
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,180
- Gosh, this is a conch. - Take it out from the net. Hurry.

299
00:10:28,184 --> 00:10:30,010
- Why don't I see any fish? - Take out the conch.

300
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:31,050
There's no fish here.

301
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:33,150
- It's stuck there. - Hold on. I'm pulling it up now.

302
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:35,550
- Then how should I pull it? - Take out the conch.

303
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:37,620
- Hold on. How do I get this out? - Conch, conch

304
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,255
(Struggling over a conch)

305
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:43,830
(It's a shaky start. Will we be okay?)

306
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,460
- Move aside. It's a fish. - Here's a fish!

307
00:10:46,469 --> 00:10:48,100
(A fish-looking creature is pulled up this time.)

308
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,170
- Where is it? - It's a fish.

309
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:50,970
- It's a rockfish. - What is that?

310
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:52,900
Isn't this a rockfish?

311
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:54,670
- It's a scorpionfish. - Pardon?

312
00:10:54,677 --> 00:10:56,740
(This won't count.)

313
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:57,910
- A scorpionfish. - A scorpionfish.

314
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:59,240
(It was on the board.)

315
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,910
- Pardon? - I see. A scorpionfish.

316
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:02,080
- A scorpionfish. - Gosh.

317
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,880
Here it comes. What is this?

318
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:06,150
- It's a big one. - What is this one?

319
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,750
- It's a fish. - It's a rockfish.

320
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:09,590
(It's definitely not a scorpionfish. Can this one count?)

321
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,620
What is this one?

322
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,420
- A filefish. - A filefish.

323
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:13,660
(This species won't count.)

324
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,555
This is driving me crazy.

325
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,530
- Gosh. - A filefish.

326
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,000
- We got scorpionfish and filefish. - Do I let this one go?

327
00:11:20,002 --> 00:11:22,295
(Give it some time.)

328
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,770
What is this one?

329
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,940
It's a filefish again. My goodness.

330
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,040
- Here comes the filefish. - My gosh.

331
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:29,270
- What's this one? - A scorpionfish.

332
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,010
- A scorpionfish. - A scorpionfish?

333
00:11:31,013 --> 00:11:33,080
- What a shame. - It's making sounds.

334
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:34,580
- What? What is it? - It's making sounds.

335
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:35,910
(Is the filefish making sounds?)

336
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:37,580
- Stop lying. - I'm serious!

337
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:38,580
- Stop lying. - Stop conning us.

338
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:39,880
- It's really making sounds. - Seriously.

339
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,845
(Grinding)

340
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:45,620
(It's really making sounds!)

341
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:46,790
- This one makes a noise. - It makes a noise.

342
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,560
I told you so. I said it makes noises.

343
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:49,790
It made a sound.

344
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,030
- Do I just take this out? - A filefish...

345
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,200
- Is it because it's stuck? - It was grinding.

346
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:54,200
That sound comes from grinding teeth.

347
00:11:54,203 --> 00:11:57,165
- This fish has teeth? - Yes, it does.

348
00:11:57,473 --> 00:11:59,740
- It has teeth? - Otherwise, how can they eat?

349
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,570
- Gosh, but look at its mouth. - Look at this fish.

350
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:02,910
- Look how big they are. - It does have teeth.

351
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:05,540
- Its teeth are like piranha's. - They are sharp.

352
00:12:05,548 --> 00:12:07,080
But this one resembles you.

353
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,810
- Me? - Yes.

354
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:10,550
- What are you talking about? - Don't you look like this?

355
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:11,780
Kwang Soo, look at this. It's you.

356
00:12:11,787 --> 00:12:14,220
(It resembles the startled look of yours.)

357
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:16,090
- I don't look like that. - You try it.

358
00:12:16,092 --> 00:12:17,590
You try it.

359
00:12:17,593 --> 00:12:19,360
See? You two look alike. You look like the filefish.

360
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,360
(Trivia: Startled Kwang Soo looks like a filefish.)

361
00:12:21,364 --> 00:12:22,890
- You should try it. - I think it might hurt.

362
00:12:22,898 --> 00:12:24,760
- I can't pull it hard. - I'm scared of that too.

363
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,930
- You'll kill the fish. Hurry up. - Okay.

364
00:12:26,936 --> 00:12:29,130
- You'll earn nothing at this rate. - The filefish...

365
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:30,800
- has thorns on it. - That's fine.

366
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:33,100
- Be careful. - Just grab it by the mouth.

367
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,740
Grab it like this, and pull it out.

368
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:39,240
(This is the skill of a captain with 45 years of experience.)

369
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:41,180
It has horns on its head.

370
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,050
- This one is almost dead. - It's not dead.

371
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:44,750
- It's not dead? - It's pretending to be.

372
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,150
He's more energetic than you.

373
00:12:46,155 --> 00:12:47,820
(What are you talking about?)

374
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,890
- Did you seriously just say that? - I'm serious.

375
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,190
- Hey, how could you say that? - Listen.

376
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:53,560
- The net... Seok Jin. - I'm energetic. Don't you know?

377
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:55,090
- You were mean to the fish first. - Hey.

378
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:57,530
Listen. Why did you say the fish was dead when it wasn't?

379
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,700
- But this one is dying. - What do you mean?

380
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:03,925
- We have to hurry up. - Stop chatting.

381
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,510
How many of these small nets do you have?

382
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:09,710
About...

383
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:12,380
10 of 75m nets make up this one.

384
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,710
- 10 nets? - Yes.

385
00:13:13,716 --> 00:13:15,405
It's 750m long.

386
00:13:16,052 --> 00:13:18,550
- My arms are about to fall off. - I know, right?

387
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,820
- Jae Seok, should we switch? - No.

388
00:13:20,823 --> 00:13:22,390
This is hard work.

389
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,690
How do you do this all by yourself?

390
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,215
- This is no joke. - I've been doing it for years.

391
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:30,325
Pull it. Keep going.

392
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:33,600
(He stays away as he only cheers them on.)

393
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:35,170
- Do a good job. - What are you doing?

394
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:37,270
- What? - What are you doing, Seok Jin?

395
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:40,770
- What do you mean? Hey. - You're not going to work?

396
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,140
I'm working here. If I join, I'll mess up the set-up.

397
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:46,175
(To keep the line going, he won't join them.)

398
00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:48,080
Here comes the net!

399
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:49,250
(He volunteers to be in charge of shouting.)

400
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,875
Here it comes.

401
00:13:50,886 --> 00:13:51,920
It's coming up.

402
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:55,050
(Thanks to him, the set-up is perfect.)

403
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,590
- Go over there, and work. - I'm working.

404
00:13:57,593 --> 00:13:59,060
- You're unbelievable. - Hey.

405
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:00,955
What are you doing?

406
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,030
(You want me to work? Fine then.)

407
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:05,260
There aren't that much fish unlike what I expected.

408
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,930
- The weather might be too good. - Is it because of the good weather?

409
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:09,830
When the weather is too good, they go away.

410
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,670
How many kilograms does a big flatfish weigh?

411
00:14:11,674 --> 00:14:14,370
- A big one weighs 15kg or 20kg. - 5kg?

412
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:16,370
There's one that weighs 20kg?

413
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:18,905
How many fish can you catch when it's in season?

414
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:21,610
- When it's in season... - Is this for "Hometown Report"?

415
00:14:21,617 --> 00:14:25,475
- We have to catch 72 fish. - Please help us out.

416
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:28,020
How many times do we haul up the net?

417
00:14:28,023 --> 00:14:30,150
Stop interviewing him.

418
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,515
Get to work. You're here to work.

419
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:35,060
- Why are you interviewing him? - Why not?

420
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:36,790
- I was just curious. - Why?

421
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,000
I was wondering for how long we needed to haul it up.

422
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,900
Seok Jin, can you stay in the water for a second?

423
00:14:40,903 --> 00:14:44,670
(Can you just go in there?)

424
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:46,000
(If I keep this up, people will criticize me.)

425
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:47,770
You're unbelievable.

426
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:50,510
(Working hard)

427
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:52,475
Hey, you know what?

428
00:14:52,648 --> 00:14:55,150
Stop pulling up the net for a second.

429
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:56,745
Why?

430
00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:58,650
Let them film me pulling it up.

431
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:02,390
(I'm not working in any of the clips.)

432
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,690
- Did you just hear him? - What did he say?

433
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:08,160
- He wants them to film him working. - Move.

434
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:09,690
Go away.

435
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:11,230
- What's the matter with you? - Come on.

436
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,860
- What's wrong with you? - What do you think you're doing?

437
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:15,000
They can insert the clip in the middle.

438
00:15:15,004 --> 00:15:17,070
- What are you doing? - You told them that.

439
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:19,035
I think I'm not working at all.

440
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:20,570
All right. Here it goes.

441
00:15:20,576 --> 00:15:22,505
(Seok Jin tries to haul up the net.)

442
00:15:22,978 --> 00:15:24,410
(Empty)

443
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:27,580
There aren't much fish in the net.

444
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,310
We're in trouble. We can't finish...

445
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:31,550
- the part-time jobs today. - What are we going to do?

446
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,350
I thought we would catch a lot, but I guess not.

447
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,820
- I know, right? - There's no fish.

448
00:15:34,823 --> 00:15:37,020
(As soon as Seok Jin grabs the net, the net is empty.)

449
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:38,690
- It's coming. Gosh, here it comes. - What is it?

450
00:15:38,694 --> 00:15:40,260
(At that time, something is in the net.)

451
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:43,060
(This is a chance for Seok Jin to get a clip of working hard.)

452
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,530
(Will it be a flatfish, rockfish, or rock cod?)

453
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:45,800
- Here they are. We have two fish. - I see.

454
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,500
- It's filefish. - It is?

455
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:49,700
- They're all filefish. - We have a lot of filefish.

456
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,600
We caught four of them.

457
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,995
We should have picked filefish.

458
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:56,140
I thought we would catch a lot, but I guess not.

459
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,440
- I know, right? - There's no fish.

460
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:00,880
(Is it because of his bad luck? There's no more fish.)

461
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:02,780
- What are we going to do? - We won't be able to finish today.

462
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,250
(They keep hauling the empty net, and time is passing by.)

463
00:16:05,254 --> 00:16:06,920
- It's a scorpionfish? - We got more fish.

464
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,890
- Where? Let me see. A filefish. - Here's one.

465
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,585
We should have picked filefish.

466
00:16:12,127 --> 00:16:14,660
- Filefish is in season. - Seriously.

467
00:16:14,663 --> 00:16:16,530
You caught six filefish now.

468
00:16:16,532 --> 00:16:18,800
- We should have picked filefish. - We should've gotten filefish.

469
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,400
We didn't pick filefish.

470
00:16:20,402 --> 00:16:22,400
- Kwang Soo, why didn't you pick it? - What?

471
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,070
(He picks on Kwang Soo.)

472
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:25,700
(Are you talking to me?)

473
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,535
Do you want to be pricked with a filefish?

474
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:29,840
Here.

475
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,140
(Where are all the flatfish, rockfish, and rock cod?)

476
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:32,580
Be careful.

477
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:34,480
You should be careful with jellyfish.

478
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,080
- Jellyfish? - Jellyfish?

479
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,450
There are jellyfish.

480
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:38,550
Pull it.

481
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:40,950
The captain says we shouldn't touch them.

482
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,485
Kwang Soo, stay away.

483
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,120
(As soon as the captain holds the net...)

484
00:16:44,126 --> 00:16:45,390
Here it comes!

485
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,560
What's that?

486
00:16:46,562 --> 00:16:47,660
(Something is in the net.)

487
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:49,390
- I've never seen this kind of fish. - What's that?

488
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:50,730
What's this fish?

489
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:52,560
- It's a bass. - Unbelievable.

490
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:54,100
(They catch a huge bass.)

491
00:16:54,103 --> 00:16:56,100
- It looks... - It's incredible.

492
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:57,400
How much is it worth?

493
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:59,600
It's worth as much as a flatfish.

494
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:01,835
I've never seen such a big bass.

495
00:17:02,478 --> 00:17:03,710
(With the captain's help...)

496
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:06,405
- What's that? - That sea urchin is so big.

497
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:07,680
(I've never seen a live one.)

498
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:09,205
It's a sea urchin.

499
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,380
It's moving.

500
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:13,520
- The spines are moving. - Yes.

501
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:15,315
(Each spine is moving.)

502
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,990
- There's something in the net. - It's a John Dory.

503
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,960
- What? - It's a John Dory.

504
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:22,390
- What's the name? - John Dory.

505
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,230
- John Dory? - It looks interesting.

506
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,330
- What's the name again? - It has a pattern.

507
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:28,100
- It looks like an eye. - John Dory?

508
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:30,900
President Moon Jae In and Kim Jong Un ate it together.

509
00:17:30,906 --> 00:17:32,570
- They ate it? - What?

510
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:34,040
It's a shrimp!

511
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,340
We caught a shrimp.

512
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:36,440
Look at this shrimp.

513
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:39,010
(Jae Seok finds a large shrimp.)

514
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:40,505
Where?

515
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:44,175
They do this on the fishing channel.

516
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:48,415
(Part-time Fishing Job)

517
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,490
(Let me join you.)

518
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:53,985
It's a huge shrimp.

519
00:17:54,063 --> 00:17:55,260
Put that in the container.

520
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:56,730
It's so big.

521
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,530
This fish has the nickname of "golden fish".

522
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:00,160
- What? - A golden fish.

523
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,900
It's a golden fish.

524
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,070
That looks so interesting.

525
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:04,170
(The fish is covered in gold scales.)

526
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:05,170
It's so interesting.

527
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,170
This fish is rare. It's a golden fish.

528
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:09,335
(Kwang Soo was jealous of Jae Seok.)

529
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,480
(I caught a golden fish.)

530
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,880
(Isn't it cute?)

531
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,080
(Let me put it in my mouth. I'm just joking.)

532
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:20,720
(Part-time Fishing Job)

533
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:22,390
(Young fish are released.)

534
00:18:22,391 --> 00:18:24,290
We've only caught rare fish so far.

535
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,520
(We shouldn't be laughing.)

536
00:18:26,528 --> 00:18:27,790
Kwang Soo, come here.

537
00:18:27,796 --> 00:18:30,760
- There's a camera, Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

538
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,930
The captain said they catch a lot of flatfish.

539
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:35,730
But we haven't caught any. What should we do?

540
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:38,195
How are we going to catch 72 fish?

541
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:41,040
You'll catch 70 fish soon.

542
00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:43,610
But we have to catch certain types of fish.

543
00:18:43,612 --> 00:18:45,135
(The type matters more.)

544
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:48,510
(They haven't caught any of the 3 types of fish that count.)

545
00:18:48,517 --> 00:18:54,815
(They've only caught rare but unimportant fish.)

546
00:18:55,991 --> 00:19:00,655
(They've caught every kind except flatfish, rockfish, and rock cod.)

547
00:19:01,063 --> 00:19:06,325
(They might have to go back without catching any.)

548
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,600
- Can we take a break? - We need to hurry up.

549
00:19:08,604 --> 00:19:10,470
- Hurry up. - Please stop for a moment.

550
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:13,170
(Where are all the flatfish, rockfish, and rock cod?)

551
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:14,240
(Let's keep going!)

552
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:15,240
That's a flatfish.

553
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:16,740
- It's a flatfish! - It's a flatfish!

554
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:19,080
(Finally,)

555
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:21,675
(they catch a flatfish.)

556
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:22,950
(They finally catch a fish that counts.)

557
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:25,520
(Flopping)

558
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:26,520
Look at that.

559
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:28,150
We caught it.

560
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,785
Unbelievable.

561
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:31,490
- It's so big. - It's incredible.

562
00:19:31,493 --> 00:19:33,085
It's huge.

563
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:34,590
Is it usually this big?

564
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:35,660
It's so big!

565
00:19:35,664 --> 00:19:36,930
(Is a flatfish usually this big?)

566
00:19:36,932 --> 00:19:38,530
- It's so big! - Look at its mouth.

567
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:40,995
(Flopping)

568
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,865
(They're making a fuss.)

569
00:19:44,273 --> 00:19:46,140
Take it out,

570
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,140
- and put it in the tank. - It's so big. What should we do?

571
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,070
- Tear the nest a little. - Tear it?

572
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:51,740
- Tear it? - But not too much.

573
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:53,240
- Don't tear it too much. - Look at the teeth.

574
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,810
Its mouth is so big.

575
00:19:54,817 --> 00:19:56,180
(It has a big mouth.)

576
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,445
It has teeth.

577
00:19:59,087 --> 00:20:00,150
- This is... - It's...

578
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,150
(They're about to faint.)

579
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,690
(When the fish flops,)

580
00:20:04,693 --> 00:20:06,820
(they become terrified.)

581
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,060
Hold on.

582
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,530
Don't be more startled than the fish is.

583
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,225
Gosh, I can't believe it.

584
00:20:13,335 --> 00:20:14,995
Hurry up and...

585
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:18,670
(What is it doing?)

586
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:20,270
(Startled)

587
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:21,770
Gosh, it's so strong.

588
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,510
Don't be so startled.

589
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,210
Put it in the tank.

590
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:26,340
- Put it in. - Put it in.

591
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:28,480
Please move your foot.

592
00:20:28,484 --> 00:20:29,580
(Panicking)

593
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:30,850
Kwon Ryeol, move!

594
00:20:30,853 --> 00:20:32,380
Move! Pull yourself together!

595
00:20:32,387 --> 00:20:33,380
(Kwon Ryeol, stay on alert while you're at the sea.)

596
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,220
Put it in here.

597
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:36,490
(I was just trying to film you.)

598
00:20:36,492 --> 00:20:37,985
It's a filefish.

599
00:20:38,227 --> 00:20:39,660
- Put it in. - Here.

600
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,860
We've caught only one flatfish?

601
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:43,160
(They've finally caught a flatfish.)

602
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:44,530
I feel so happy.

603
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,525
We caught a flatfish.

604
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,430
The flatfish is so big.

605
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:50,225
It's incredible.

606
00:20:51,874 --> 00:20:53,795
We're almost done.

607
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:56,240
We're done.

608
00:20:56,245 --> 00:20:57,410
- We're done. - We're done!

609
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,910
(The first net is in.)

610
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,975
- Let me finish up. - Okay.

611
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:05,150
Gosh, it's not easy.

612
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:06,775
Gosh.

613
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,150
How many fish did we catch that count?

614
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:10,520
One.

615
00:21:10,526 --> 00:21:12,320
(Just one? We worked so hard.)

616
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:13,990
- Just 1? - Just 1?

617
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,060
(Just one? We worked so hard.)

618
00:21:15,063 --> 00:21:16,690
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

619
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:18,630
Let's check the second net.

620
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:19,860
- The second net? - Yes.

621
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,800
How are we going to catch 72 fish?

622
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:25,070
(They move to the next spot, hoping they'll catch more fish.)

623
00:21:25,073 --> 00:21:27,070
- Come on in. - It smells so good here.

624
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,570
He even lit scented candles.

625
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:31,910
Will you play escape room first?

626
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:33,240
- Sure. - Good.

627
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,280
- Then... - The time...

628
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:36,310
Are you going to make a game just for me?

629
00:21:36,318 --> 00:21:37,350
Or are we playing it together?

630
00:21:37,352 --> 00:21:40,150
We should make one for Haha.

631
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:41,720
Haha wanted to play it, so we should make it for him.

632
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:45,020
But if you fail to escape, you'll be penalized.

633
00:21:45,027 --> 00:21:46,420
Then let me stay here for a while.

634
00:21:46,428 --> 00:21:47,660
(He's not interested in escaping.)

635
00:21:47,663 --> 00:21:48,790
No.

636
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:50,630
I think we should do this.

637
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,930
Haha will compete with a member in each room.

638
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:54,900
Since there are many rooms?

639
00:21:54,903 --> 00:21:57,500
He can escape when he's done.

640
00:21:57,506 --> 00:22:00,540
But don't make me arm-wrestle with Jong Kook...

641
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,370
- or something. - We should be realistic.

642
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:06,480
You're supposed to use your brain.

643
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,075
But it'd be boring if you just used your brain.

644
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:11,250
You should use your body too.

645
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:12,550
- That'd be more fun. - He's right.

646
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:16,645
Why would people watch this show instead of a quiz show?

647
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:20,360
- Right? - I'm not talking about a quiz show.

648
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:23,130
- It should be more dynamic. - He's right.

649
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,630
But you don't use your body in the escape room.

650
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:27,130
- They don't do that. - You can do it.

651
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:30,470
We'll have different kinds of games.

652
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:33,070
If I fail to escape,

653
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:34,740
what's the penalty?

654
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:37,410
We'll slap you on the forehead.

655
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:39,010
Or a water slap.

656
00:22:39,014 --> 00:22:40,480
- Water slap. - What do you think?

657
00:22:40,482 --> 00:22:41,810
So I'll be hit either way.

658
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:43,705
(There is no difference.)

659
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,180
(What's the big deal? I'll be hit anyway.)

660
00:22:46,188 --> 00:22:47,820
- No. - The fun part is...

661
00:22:47,823 --> 00:22:50,185
- when you escape. - Yes.

662
00:22:51,293 --> 00:22:53,060
It's already decided.

663
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,360
- It can't be an impossible game. - Right.

664
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,730
Also, in the escape room,

665
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:00,160
you're given up to three hints.

666
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,200
- There are hints? - You can call the staff.

667
00:23:02,204 --> 00:23:04,000
- All right. - Je Sung is calling me.

668
00:23:04,006 --> 00:23:05,600
Really? Okay.

669
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:07,440
- Ask him for pork belly meat. - Where are you?

670
00:23:07,442 --> 00:23:09,340
- I'm at Sogang University. - Hello.

671
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,240
- What? - I'm at Sogang University.

672
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:13,140
- You're nearby. What are you doing? - Let me talk to him.

673
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:14,480
I just finished shooting.

674
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,910
He's finished.

675
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:18,780
- Je Sung, are you done? - What?

676
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:19,850
- Are you done? - Hello?

677
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:21,320
- Je Sung. - Yes, I'm done.

678
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:23,290
Don't you recognize my voice?

679
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,690
- Hi. - What?

680
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,790
It's our Protein Man.

681
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:29,385
(He sure is a member of Jong Kook's fan club.)

682
00:23:29,898 --> 00:23:32,230
- Protein Man? - Yes.

683
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:34,795
You're my number one fan.

684
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,300
- Je Sung. - Yes?

685
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:39,065
- Are you free? - What's the matter?

686
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:41,170
I only have "Comedy Big League".

687
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:43,010
Really? That's great.

688
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,640
Je Sung, you won.

689
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:46,980
What do you mean?

690
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:52,080
You're 2019's Rising Comedy Star.

691
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,650
It's not 2019 yet.

692
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:55,420
Yes. You're expected to be one.

693
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,590
(He is expected to be 2019's Rising Comedy Star.)

694
00:23:57,592 --> 00:24:00,460
Can you appear on our show?

695
00:24:00,462 --> 00:24:02,530
Of course, I can.

696
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:03,930
(He immediately agrees.)

697
00:24:03,932 --> 00:24:05,530
Congratulations!

698
00:24:05,534 --> 00:24:08,130
(2019's Rising Comedy Star will appear on the show.)

699
00:24:08,136 --> 00:24:12,100
But to come here, you have to pay a fee.

700
00:24:12,107 --> 00:24:13,935
What?

701
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,910
You can't come here empty-handed.

702
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:20,505
You can just get some pork belly meat on the way.

703
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:22,180
You just needed someone to bring meat, didn't you?

704
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:25,080
(He's quick.)

705
00:24:25,087 --> 00:24:28,920
Je Sung. I'm not like that. What's with you?

706
00:24:28,924 --> 00:24:31,320
- Are you sure? Should I be happy? - I just missed you.

707
00:24:31,326 --> 00:24:33,060
Of course.

708
00:24:33,061 --> 00:24:35,390
- I'll gladly do it. - All right.

709
00:24:35,397 --> 00:24:38,560
Our viewers have never seen you...

710
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:41,500
on our show.

711
00:24:41,503 --> 00:24:43,900
Then I'll prepare a few funny outfits.

712
00:24:43,905 --> 00:24:46,165
(He sure is the rising star.)

713
00:24:46,541 --> 00:24:48,640
Good. That's great.

714
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:52,110
Then we'll be looking forward.

715
00:24:52,114 --> 00:24:53,680
- Okay. - Okay. Hold on.

716
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,480
- Please wait a moment. - Okay. Hold on.

717
00:24:55,484 --> 00:24:57,480
- Hurry up. - Okay.

718
00:24:57,486 --> 00:24:59,150
Je Sung is amazing.

719
00:24:59,154 --> 00:25:01,150
- He's bringing pork belly meat. - I love him.

720
00:25:01,156 --> 00:25:03,120
- I know. - He's amazing.

721
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,790
He's incredible.

722
00:25:04,793 --> 00:25:07,090
I think our tteokbokki is here.

723
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:08,890
- Do you hear it? - It's here.

724
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:10,130
- Okay. Tteokbokki. - It's here.

725
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:12,960
- Do you want to eat first? - Thank you.

726
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,600
You have 90 cents left now.

727
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,770
We have some money left?

728
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:18,070
We have 90 cents left.

729
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:20,070
- I'm so hungry. - Right?

730
00:25:20,075 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm suddenly so hungry.

731
00:25:21,443 --> 00:25:23,040
Sundae.

732
00:25:23,044 --> 00:25:24,210
It looks so tasty.

733
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:25,310
It's still hot.

734
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,610
(After the cold sauna...)

735
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:29,250
It tastes so good.

736
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,580
We're eating so well.

737
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:32,520
- We were hungry. - We were hungry.

738
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:36,115
- We rode bikes and took a sauna. - Right.

739
00:25:36,391 --> 00:25:38,990
Many people spend their holidays at hotels these days.

740
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,120
Right.

741
00:25:40,128 --> 00:25:41,590
You seem to know a lot about new trends.

742
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:43,090
- I do. - He knows a lot.

743
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:44,630
He knows a lot.

744
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,960
We should have ordered more.

745
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,800
We had only 17 dollars.

746
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,130
Can't we order something for 90 cents?

747
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,570
(The 5 of them are sharing 2 portions.)

748
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,665
- 90 cents... - I'm not full yet.

749
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,810
(I want more food.)

750
00:25:55,811 --> 00:25:57,710
Se Chan, do you have instant rice?

751
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,980
- What? - I want some rice.

752
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:01,410
- Are you serious? - Warm up some rice.

753
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,145
- But we have to eat the meat too. - We can.

754
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:05,980
Will you be okay?

755
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:08,720
I eat three times more than ordinary people.

756
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:10,390
- You'll be surprised. - Do you want some tuna too?

757
00:26:10,392 --> 00:26:11,915
Sure.

758
00:26:13,094 --> 00:26:14,960
Cook some noodles too while you're at it.

759
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:16,090
(While you're at it...)

760
00:26:16,097 --> 00:26:17,830
- That sounds good. - I want some.

761
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,860
- Me too. - Me too.

762
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,300
We have to eat the meat too.

763
00:26:21,303 --> 00:26:23,025
We can.

764
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,470
We're on vacation.

765
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:27,170
Stop what you're doing. Do you see the rice bowl?

766
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:28,970
- Rice bowl? - Get some gochujang.

767
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,170
Shall we make bibimbap?

768
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:31,310
- That sounds delicious. - Bibimbap and noodles.

769
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:32,940
- I want bibimbap. - Okay.

770
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:35,280
Make it with tuna. Is it a small or large can?

771
00:26:35,283 --> 00:26:37,180
- It's a small one. - Is there brown rice?

772
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,950
- Brown rice? - Instant brown rice.

773
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:40,750
Is there any brown rice?

774
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:43,050
Cook two servings of instant rice.

775
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:45,790
Are there any side dishes?

776
00:26:45,794 --> 00:26:47,290
Microwave some rice.

777
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:49,355
- Chef. - Yes?

778
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:51,330
Do you have dried yellow corvina?

779
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,825
(Haha is the worst.)

780
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,400
- What? - Dried yellow corvina.

781
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:57,495
I've never had it.

782
00:26:58,173 --> 00:26:59,500
(Se Chan might explode if they ask for more.)

783
00:26:59,507 --> 00:27:01,770
I'll help you. Shall I mix the rice?

784
00:27:01,776 --> 00:27:04,240
I got it. Just sit and wait.

785
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,040
- Se Chan. - Yes?

786
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:07,875
Did you steal this?

787
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,945
(There's a sticker with a Running Man logo.)

788
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:14,520
Wait a minute, wait.

789
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:15,720
Why is there a sticker?

790
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:16,790
(A penny saved is a penny earned.)

791
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,190
Did the staff put it on?

792
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,320
How could you?

793
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,790
They made me a thief. That's nonsense.

794
00:27:21,796 --> 00:27:24,730
No way. It's not attached to this side.

795
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:25,960
You wait.

796
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:28,930
What if everything in the fridge has R stickers?

797
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:31,465
(We'll watch him carefully from now on.)

798
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:33,040
That's impossible.

799
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,140
(While they make bibimbap and noodles...)

800
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:36,040
I'll make some noodles.

801
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,040
(Jong Kook and So Min clean up.)

802
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:39,110
With kimchi, it's really tasty.

803
00:27:39,114 --> 00:27:40,980
(She wipes the floor.)

804
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:43,845
Honey.

805
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:46,850
We raised our children well.

806
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,650
(Father Jong Kook believes in not wasting anything.)

807
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:51,990
(A play called "Jong Kook, Don't Cry")

808
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:54,955
(So Min's role model is Shin Saimdang.)

809
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,295
My husband will scold me, so I'll use what was used.

810
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:02,495
Wipe my mouth as well.

811
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:04,970
That's not what I meant.

812
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:07,640
Don't do that. Your health is important.

813
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:12,205
You might get sick. Medicine and hospital fees will cost more.

814
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:14,910
Don't get sick. It's a mission.

815
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:17,545
(Don't get sick. It's a mission.)

816
00:28:17,953 --> 00:28:18,950
(If you fail the mission,)

817
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,920
(you'll be imprisoned in my heart.)

818
00:28:21,923 --> 00:28:24,115
(Her heart flutters.)

819
00:28:25,093 --> 00:28:27,090
- A mission? - I'll scold you if you get sick.

820
00:28:27,095 --> 00:28:28,460
(He gives his all for his love.)

821
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:30,630
You'll be scolded if you get sick.

822
00:28:30,632 --> 00:28:32,030
(Back in the day when they saved everything)

823
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,030
That's right.

824
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:37,765
(It's a play that shows our fathers' love.)

825
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:39,970
Did they become a married couple?

826
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,535
(What's going on?)

827
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,705
- We need to make one more rice. - Okay.

828
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:47,910
How many did you make? Make about three more.

829
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,280
Aren't you going to eat pork belly meat?

830
00:28:49,284 --> 00:28:51,350
I can eat them all.

831
00:28:51,353 --> 00:28:54,620
Goodness, I don't like taking just one bite.

832
00:28:54,622 --> 00:28:56,650
- How many rice did you make? - I made two.

833
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:58,990
No, that won't be enough for everyone.

834
00:28:58,994 --> 00:29:00,490
(No one knew how much he ate or about his special recipe.)

835
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:02,490
(He's tired of chicken breast.)

836
00:29:02,497 --> 00:29:04,925
(Let your precious stomach be free.)

837
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:07,530
- How many rice is it? - It's two.

838
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,030
- Is that 2? Make 1 more. - Yes.

839
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:11,470
- What? - How will we eat them all?

840
00:29:11,473 --> 00:29:13,535
I used to make this a lot.

841
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:18,205
One is regular tuna, and the other is chili tuna.

842
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,675
(Did you eat like this regularly?)

843
00:29:21,082 --> 00:29:22,080
(A lot of sesame oil)

844
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:24,245
Goodness.

845
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:27,145
- It looks delicious. - It looks very good.

846
00:29:27,322 --> 00:29:29,120
It'd be good without gochujang.

847
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:32,085
- This is great. - Okay.

848
00:29:33,762 --> 00:29:34,790
This looks good.

849
00:29:34,796 --> 00:29:36,285
(Shall I eat now?)

850
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,160
Let me have one bite, Jong Kook.

851
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:41,030
- No. - Just one bite. You have a lot.

852
00:29:41,036 --> 00:29:42,800
You're a pig if you eat all of it.

853
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:45,500
Bring another spoon, So Min.

854
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:46,770
- Honey. - Bring a spoon.

855
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,940
(Honey)

856
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:50,710
- One bite, please. - Bring a spoon.

857
00:29:50,712 --> 00:29:52,335
Dad.

858
00:29:52,547 --> 00:29:54,180
- My baby. - Here you go.

859
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:56,550
(Honey, have only one bite.)

860
00:29:56,551 --> 00:29:58,150
- Isn't it okay? - It's delicious.

861
00:29:58,153 --> 00:30:00,350
- Did you add gochujang? - No.

862
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:03,720
I should make this at home. It's delicious.

863
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:07,060
We ate 17 dollars' worth of tteokbokki...

864
00:30:07,062 --> 00:30:08,590
and 40 dollars' worth of food here.

865
00:30:08,596 --> 00:30:09,830
(We eat well at Se Chan's house.)

866
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,230
Eat. It's okay.

867
00:30:11,232 --> 00:30:13,755
I feel like we're on a real vacation.

868
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:15,795
Let's go.

869
00:30:15,804 --> 00:30:17,470
Let's eat. It'll get soggy.

870
00:30:17,472 --> 00:30:19,540
- It's ready. - Jong Kook.

871
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:21,340
You're our eldest son.

872
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:23,240
- I'm your eldest son? - My son.

873
00:30:23,244 --> 00:30:26,840
(Haha thinks that his father is just an older brother.)

874
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:29,780
- Our second eldest son. - Mother.

875
00:30:29,784 --> 00:30:30,780
(Se Chan is a troublemaker who returned home last year.)

876
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:32,350
Our youngest daughter.

877
00:30:32,353 --> 00:30:34,920
(She doesn't look the youngest at all.)

878
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:37,290
Dad, why do we always steal from empty houses?

879
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,020
("Please Go Home")

880
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,460
- Let's make it our home. - How much is it?

881
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:41,460
(It's a movie about a family that breaks into other people's houses.)

882
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:42,930
Isn't it new every day?

883
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,530
(It's a movie about a family that breaks into other people's houses.)

884
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:47,900
People at my school ask me what your occupation is.

885
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:50,470
Tell them I'm in real estate.

886
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:53,340
(He attempts to protect his son's pride.)

887
00:30:53,341 --> 00:30:57,040
Our second eldest is bullied around. What should we do?

888
00:30:57,045 --> 00:31:00,180
That's right, Dad. Kids keep hitting me.

889
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:02,410
If you get hit by others, I'll hit you twice as hard at home.

890
00:31:02,417 --> 00:31:04,275
(Blood-curdling)

891
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:06,320
You'll hit your son twice as hard?

892
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:09,015
(He attempts to make his son stronger.)

893
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:12,385
(The movie ends to protect the second eldest son.)

894
00:31:12,427 --> 00:31:15,155
I thought it was a lot, but it's not now that I've finished it.

895
00:31:15,296 --> 00:31:16,930
- He finished it. - Goodness.

896
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:18,725
(Clean)

897
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,330
I'm so happy. It really feels like a vacation.

898
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:23,670
- Now... - Shall we start?

899
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:25,070
- Escape room? - No.

900
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:27,635
- Bring some fruit. - Do you have any fruit?

901
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,240
- Do you have any fruit? - That's enough.

902
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:31,240
(That's enough.)

903
00:31:31,246 --> 00:31:35,275
(The owner of the house explodes.)

904
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:38,450
(I'm sorry, Se Chan.)

905
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,650
- Let's start the game. - Okay, I'm sorry.

906
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:42,020
(It's been an hour.)

907
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:44,220
- I have fruit. - It's too scary.

908
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:45,220
(They finally start the game.)

909
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:48,590
Haha, please leave for a while.

910
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:50,430
- We'll discuss. - I'll stay here.

911
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:51,730
Let us discuss.

912
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,900
Okay, I'll go inside.

913
00:31:53,902 --> 00:31:56,095
- What? - They're here.

914
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:57,570
How could he...

915
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,670
- He's here. - be so accurate?

916
00:31:59,674 --> 00:32:01,140
It's unbelievable.

917
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:03,765
- I never saw him in person. - I know.

918
00:32:03,811 --> 00:32:04,840
(Sirens)

919
00:32:04,846 --> 00:32:07,180
- Goodness. - The police are here.

920
00:32:07,182 --> 00:32:08,810
Are they the police?

921
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:09,850
- Right. - Seriously?

922
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,450
We guessed everything right.

923
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:13,045
Je Sung.

924
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:16,890
(He wears an armor of a comedian.)

925
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:19,960
(The rising star of 2019 appears.)

926
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,060
Je Sung.

927
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:23,555
(What's going on?)

928
00:32:24,032 --> 00:32:27,530
(His appearance makes them burst out in laughter.)

929
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:28,630
What's going on?

930
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:31,400
(He makes everyone roll on the floor.)

931
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:35,335
(His armor as a comedian)

932
00:32:35,677 --> 00:32:38,140
(It can't be pierced with anything.)

933
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:40,040
(Invincible armor)

934
00:32:40,048 --> 00:32:43,005
- Look at him. - Look at his makeup.

935
00:32:43,084 --> 00:32:46,915
He colored his tooth.

936
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:49,820
- Your tooth is colored. - This is nothing.

937
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:51,820
- Where did you get the wig? - That's hilarious.

938
00:32:51,826 --> 00:32:53,760
- Was it in the car? - Of course.

939
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:54,760
(He always carries his comedian armor with him.)

940
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,230
I have a few props in the car.

941
00:32:56,231 --> 00:32:57,630
That's impressive.

942
00:32:57,632 --> 00:32:59,060
- Okay. - I didn't expect it.

943
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:01,400
- There are so many people. - He looks funnier standing still.

944
00:33:01,402 --> 00:33:03,870
- Come here. - This is embarrassing.

945
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:06,240
- Je Sung. - Hello.

946
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:07,740
It's nice to meet you.

947
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:10,905
- I'm your huge fan. - He's a rising comedian.

948
00:33:11,346 --> 00:33:13,980
Look at the details of his outfit. He has a napkin in here.

949
00:33:13,982 --> 00:33:16,180
It's a napkin. It looks like a handkerchief.

950
00:33:16,184 --> 00:33:19,050
- It does. - I never met the two of you.

951
00:33:19,053 --> 00:33:21,520
- Right. - I had to dress properly.

952
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:24,120
- I can't change my face so... - You did a good job.

953
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:25,220
Okay.

954
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:30,130
2019 Rising Comedian, Hwang Je Sung.

955
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:31,430
(2019 Rising Comedian, Hwang Je Sung)

956
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:34,625
(2019 Rising Comedian descends to Running Man.)

957
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:36,770
(She's so happy.)

958
00:33:36,771 --> 00:33:38,570
- What are these? - You brought a lot.

959
00:33:38,573 --> 00:33:40,840
- It's meat. - Je Sung.

960
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:43,810
- It's meat. - I didn't expect that.

961
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:46,440
- We didn't expect this much. - He's so passionate.

962
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:48,980
- I live nearby. - They said it in passing.

963
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,350
He's amazing.

964
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:51,880
I came without knowing what we're doing.

965
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:53,920
- It's about timing. - This is real.

966
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:54,920
Okay.

967
00:33:54,922 --> 00:33:56,515
(How far will he go?)

968
00:33:57,692 --> 00:34:01,555
Kwang Soo, we'd be in trouble without you here.

969
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:05,325
(Exhausted)

970
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,400
(2 part-timers are already tired.)

971
00:34:08,403 --> 00:34:09,895
Seriously.

972
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:11,400
We're almost there.

973
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:12,770
(They're at the second net.)

974
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:14,635
Did we come that fast?

975
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:17,905
- My legs hurt. - I'm getting seasick.

976
00:34:19,113 --> 00:34:21,575
Okay, let's get up. Stay strong.

977
00:34:22,383 --> 00:34:25,845
What should we do? We need to pull it up.

978
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:28,715
- Pull it up. - Yes, sir.

979
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,890
We need to catch something.

980
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,760
(This is not a replay.)

981
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:38,060
(He's getting used to it. It might turn into a full-time job.)

982
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:40,455
It's an extreme job.

983
00:34:40,635 --> 00:34:43,600
Who does three part-time jobs in a day?

984
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:44,600
How many are we doing?

985
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:46,600
I knew someone who worked 2 jobs, but 3?

986
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:48,040
- It's coming. - It's coming.

987
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:49,940
It's coming. It's a flatfish.

988
00:34:49,944 --> 00:34:51,440
(They only caught 1 flatfish so far.)

989
00:34:51,446 --> 00:34:53,510
- We need to catch something. - It's a flatfish.

990
00:34:53,514 --> 00:34:54,810
(They only caught 1 flatfish so far.)

991
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,580
What's this?

992
00:34:56,584 --> 00:34:58,750
- It's mackerel. - It's a baby mackerel.

993
00:34:58,753 --> 00:34:59,720
(It doesn't count.)

994
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:01,120
(Cute)

995
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,015
Look at the baby mackerel.

996
00:35:03,157 --> 00:35:07,455
(Why is it mackerel of all fish?)

997
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:09,455
It's a mackerel.

998
00:35:09,497 --> 00:35:11,630
When we catch a mackerel,

999
00:35:11,632 --> 00:35:13,855
we catch a big fish later.

1000
00:35:13,935 --> 00:35:14,930
What did you say?

1001
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:17,400
After a mackerel, we catch a big flatfish.

1002
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,070
Do flatfish come to eat mackerel?

1003
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:20,070
(It's likely that there are many around.)

1004
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,970
After a mackerel, we catch a big flatfish?

1005
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:28,380
(It'd be nice to catch some flatfish.)

1006
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:29,710
- It's coming. - It's coming.

1007
00:35:29,717 --> 00:35:31,350
(The next fish is coming up.)

1008
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,350
It's coming.

1009
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:38,020
(Is what the captain said about flatfish correct?)

1010
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:42,060
- It's a flatfish! - It's coming.

1011
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:46,030
(They catch a large flatfish.)

1012
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:47,830
It's a flatfish!

1013
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:50,370
- It's huge. - It's big.

1014
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:52,070
Look at this.

1015
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:54,165
Its mouth is large.

1016
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:58,440
It's alive, everyone! It's a living flatfish!

1017
00:35:58,446 --> 00:36:00,180
- It's not a toy. - It's real.

1018
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,080
It's flapping and natural.

1019
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,750
It's natural.

1020
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:04,850
It's a wild flatfish.

1021
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,620
It's bigger than the other one.

1022
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,420
- How much does it weigh? - 2.5kg.

1023
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:10,615
2.5kg?

1024
00:36:11,926 --> 00:36:14,360
(Let me hold it.)

1025
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:15,790
This is amazing.

1026
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:17,830
Seok Jin wants to be on the camera.

1027
00:36:17,832 --> 00:36:19,760
(Seok Jin wants to be on the camera by holding the fish.)

1028
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,330
What? What's wrong?

1029
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,900
- Seok Jin. - I hate it when he becomes greedy.

1030
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,500
Look at its mouth.

1031
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:29,070
(He's exaggerating for the scene.)

1032
00:36:29,076 --> 00:36:31,110
It's upside down. Flip it.

1033
00:36:31,112 --> 00:36:34,010
(The fish is upside down.)

1034
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:36,810
(Like this?)

1035
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:40,175
- It's incredible. - I've never seen a fish like this.

1036
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:41,750
It's alive.

1037
00:36:41,756 --> 00:36:43,790
(He is still being greedy.)

1038
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,220
Go in there.

1039
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:46,290
(They've caught 2 flatfish.)

1040
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:47,490
It's huge.

1041
00:36:47,495 --> 00:36:49,455
Seok Jin is so funny.

1042
00:36:49,664 --> 00:36:53,430
Out of 72 fish, we've caught 2.

1043
00:36:53,434 --> 00:36:56,600
But that fish must weigh a lot.

1044
00:36:56,604 --> 00:36:59,000
It should count as more than one.

1045
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:00,440
Please count 1 per 1kg.

1046
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,440
You should.

1047
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:04,140
We can't possibly catch 72 fish.

1048
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:06,880
(Another mackerel shows up.)

1049
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:09,780
We're not catching any. All we're catching is mackerel.

1050
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:13,145
But if there's a mackerel,

1051
00:37:13,187 --> 00:37:14,650
it means we'll catch another flatfish.

1052
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:17,290
(That's what the captain said.)

1053
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:24,030
(Will they catch another flatfish like Jae Seok says?)

1054
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,500
(Come up here, flatfish.)

1055
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:28,600
Here it comes! A flatfish!

1056
00:37:28,603 --> 00:37:30,470
(Jae Seok was right.)

1057
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:32,570
- Again? - Here it comes!

1058
00:37:32,573 --> 00:37:34,535
(Another flatfish)

1059
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:37,935
(I knew it.)

1060
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,380
It's so strong.

1061
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:42,710
(It's full of energy.)

1062
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:44,575
It's a flatfish!

1063
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,945
Gosh, that hurts. It bit me.

1064
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:49,120
(He was holding the net,)

1065
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:51,620
(and the fish bit his hand.)

1066
00:37:51,626 --> 00:37:53,590
Gosh, that hurts. It bit me.

1067
00:37:53,594 --> 00:37:55,190
- Really? - It bit me.

1068
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:56,755
- It did? - Yes.

1069
00:37:56,797 --> 00:37:59,430
Gosh, it's so powerful.

1070
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,725
- How much would it weigh? - Flatfish can bite you?

1071
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:04,270
Guys, are you having fun?

1072
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,770
- Yes! - You are?

1073
00:38:05,773 --> 00:38:07,540
- You are? - Kind of.

1074
00:38:07,542 --> 00:38:10,210
As you're having so much fun,

1075
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:13,180
we'll count each kilo of flatfish as one fish.

1076
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,280
- Okay! - Now, you're talking.

1077
00:38:15,283 --> 00:38:17,180
It shouldn't count as just one.

1078
00:38:17,184 --> 00:38:19,745
This would weigh about 3kg. It should count as 3 fish.

1079
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:22,420
- We'll weigh them later. - Okay.

1080
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:24,215
It's incredible.

1081
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,990
(We might have a chance.)

1082
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,155
Look at that. Hold on.

1083
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:30,330
Something just occurred to me.

1084
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:32,455
Kwang Soo, you didn't even have to be penalized.

1085
00:38:33,034 --> 00:38:34,530
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1086
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:35,900
- I'm sorry. - Don't worry.

1087
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:37,570
I mean...

1088
00:38:37,572 --> 00:38:39,095
Now that I think of it,

1089
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:41,470
I shouldn't have challenged Jae Seok.

1090
00:38:41,475 --> 00:38:43,410
(That's where it all began.)

1091
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:50,980
(To avoid the penalty roulette, he challenged Jae Seok.)

1092
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:55,250
(Because of that, he had to travel 400km.)

1093
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:56,790
Let me say one thing.

1094
00:38:56,791 --> 00:38:59,120
Who put his shoe in the flatfish slot?

1095
00:38:59,126 --> 00:39:01,485
It's you, right?

1096
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,860
- It's you, right? - Why is that important?

1097
00:39:03,864 --> 00:39:05,730
What's important is to catch it.

1098
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:07,600
Why do we have to...

1099
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,595
catch flatfish?

1100
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,570
Because the flatfish went into the shoe.

1101
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:16,140
(Because the flatfish went into the shoe.)

1102
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,240
What?

1103
00:39:17,244 --> 00:39:19,610
He's not interested in what you're saying.

1104
00:39:19,614 --> 00:39:20,880
He cares about only one thing.

1105
00:39:20,881 --> 00:39:24,280
(He is interested in only one thing.)

1106
00:39:24,285 --> 00:39:27,145
(Shooting his scenes)

1107
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:30,415
It might get away.

1108
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:31,890
(I'm not done yet.)

1109
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:33,590
- Put it in now. - Put it in.

1110
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,660
- Put it in now. - Seok Jin.

1111
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:38,260
Why are you even laughing? Why are you laughing?

1112
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:41,530
(The second flatfish goes into the tank.)

1113
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:44,870
(More flatfish show up.)

1114
00:39:44,872 --> 00:39:46,570
This must be a flatfish spot.

1115
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:48,270
It's so big.

1116
00:39:48,275 --> 00:39:50,210
- It's incredible. - And it's a wild fish.

1117
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,510
(They seem to be catching all the flatfish in Busan.)

1118
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:53,880
There are so many flatfish.

1119
00:39:53,881 --> 00:39:56,375
(They've caught 9 flatfish.)

1120
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,150
- We're done. - We're done.

1121
00:39:58,152 --> 00:39:59,250
(No rockfish or rock cod showed up in the second net either.)

1122
00:39:59,253 --> 00:40:01,150
- We're done. - We're done.

1123
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:02,220
Should I stop it?

1124
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,020
Good work.

1125
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:06,190
Thank you.

1126
00:40:06,193 --> 00:40:08,485
(They're done with the fishing job.)

1127
00:40:08,663 --> 00:40:10,360
Good work, guys.

1128
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:13,455
(They caught 9 flatfish.)

1129
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:17,000
(Despite all the hard work, they caught only 9 fish.)

1130
00:40:17,004 --> 00:40:18,965
We didn't catch that many.

1131
00:40:18,973 --> 00:40:22,165
We won't be able to finish at this rate.

1132
00:40:22,977 --> 00:40:25,210
We still have a lot to do.

1133
00:40:25,212 --> 00:40:29,080
(Jae Seok gets up...)

1134
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:32,145
(and walks to the front part of the boat.)

1135
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:38,790
(He drinks water...)

1136
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:45,430
(and sits in the corner carefully.)

1137
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,125
Let me see.

1138
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:52,065
(He picks up his bag.)

1139
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:54,835
It never seems to end.

1140
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,335
We've been working all day.

1141
00:41:00,414 --> 00:41:04,845
(There is a pouch in the bag?)

1142
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:06,550
Here are your mission bags.

1143
00:41:06,554 --> 00:41:08,850
- There's a pouch in it. - This is yours.

1144
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:11,520
- There is a pouch inside. - There's a pouch.

1145
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:15,690
You're allowed to open it just once when you think...

1146
00:41:15,696 --> 00:41:18,230
- you can't continue working. - just once?

1147
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:21,425
And once it's opened, you can't go back.

1148
00:41:23,137 --> 00:41:26,470
(Jae Seok decides to open his pouch...)

1149
00:41:26,474 --> 00:41:29,340
(and finds a piece of paper in it.)

1150
00:41:29,343 --> 00:41:32,805
(No one is watching, right?)

1151
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:37,380
(The paper is...)

1152
00:41:37,384 --> 00:41:39,180
(a ticket to Seoul.)

1153
00:41:39,186 --> 00:41:43,015
(Bring Seok Jin's sock, and you can go home.)

1154
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:48,260
(He can go home as soon as he brings Seok Jin's sock.)

1155
00:41:48,262 --> 00:41:51,055
(The mission is on.)

1156
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:59,165
(It won't be easy. Will Jae Seok be able to go home?)

1157
00:42:01,342 --> 00:42:02,640
Did you drink water?

1158
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,110
No. Give me some.

1159
00:42:04,111 --> 00:42:06,805
(Seok Jin has no idea.)

1160
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:12,280
(He comes back without being suspected.)

1161
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:13,915
Thank you.

1162
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:17,590
(Now,)

1163
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:21,490
(he has only one target.)

1164
00:42:21,495 --> 00:42:24,230
(Seok Jin's sock)

1165
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:27,425
(It's not going to be easy.)

1166
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:31,465
(Seok Jin goes to the bathroom.)

1167
00:42:31,972 --> 00:42:34,565
(Hold on. Let me think.)

1168
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:37,940
(It's only Kwang Soo and me.)

1169
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:39,410
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1170
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:40,780
(Whispering)

1171
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:42,305
You want to go home, right?

1172
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:43,580
You want to go home, right?

1173
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:45,250
(Do you even have to ask?)

1174
00:42:45,252 --> 00:42:46,450
Listen carefully.

1175
00:42:46,453 --> 00:42:49,015
Seok Jin and I got a pouch each this morning.

1176
00:42:49,223 --> 00:42:51,085
- A pouch? - Yes.

1177
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:53,890
The staff told me I could open it when I couldn't take this anymore.

1178
00:42:53,894 --> 00:42:57,260
I wanted to finish the job, but it just seems impossible.

1179
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,630
It's impossible. We won't be able to go back today.

1180
00:42:58,632 --> 00:43:00,525
- Listen. - Okay.

1181
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:04,195
If I bring Seok Jin's sock,

1182
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,100
I'm done.

1183
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:08,440
(If I bring Seok Jin's sock, I'm done.)

1184
00:43:08,442 --> 00:43:10,140
(Intrigued)

1185
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:13,110
You're interested, right? You want to go home or not?

1186
00:43:13,113 --> 00:43:14,210
Please slap me on the forehead.

1187
00:43:14,215 --> 00:43:15,905
(Help me.)

1188
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:17,880
Okay.

1189
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:19,050
Just keep that in mind.

1190
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,820
(If Kwang Soo helps Jae Seok,)

1191
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,750
(Jae Seok will slap him on the forehead so he can go home.)

1192
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:24,290
(They're back at the dock.)

1193
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,990
Thank you, Captain.

1194
00:43:25,993 --> 00:43:28,260
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1195
00:43:28,262 --> 00:43:29,690
- Thank you. - Good work.

1196
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:30,930
- Good work. - Good work.

1197
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:32,560
- Thank you. - You were the best.

1198
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,200
(How much do the flatfish weigh?)

1199
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:36,400
Gosh, I'm covered in sweat.

1200
00:43:36,403 --> 00:43:38,270
(Each kilo will count as 1 fish.)

1201
00:43:38,272 --> 00:43:40,340
- We'll count each kilo as one fish. - Okay.

1202
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:42,140
(Each kilo will count as 1 fish.)

1203
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:48,380
(The weight will be deducted from 72.)

1204
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:51,480
(They all worked hard. Will it pay off?)

1205
00:43:51,485 --> 00:43:54,515
- What's the weight? - 23kg.

1206
00:43:54,722 --> 00:43:57,490
The total weight of the 9 fish is 23kg.

1207
00:43:57,491 --> 00:43:59,490
(The target number boils down to 49.)

1208
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:01,760
We'll deduct 23.

1209
00:44:01,762 --> 00:44:03,460
That's less than I expected.

1210
00:44:03,464 --> 00:44:05,225
It's 49 now.

1211
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:06,930
It's 49 now.

1212
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:09,000
(They have to do another part-time job.)

1213
00:44:09,003 --> 00:44:12,600
(The number is 49 now.)

1214
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:15,440
- Gukje Market... - Are we going to Gukje Market?

1215
00:44:15,442 --> 00:44:18,440
- This may not be our last job. - I'm exhausted.

1216
00:44:18,445 --> 00:44:20,105
What's the number now?

1217
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:21,980
49.

1218
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:23,850
- 49? - Yes.

1219
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:25,980
- We're only halfway. - Will it really end?

1220
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:27,950
I woke up...

1221
00:44:27,955 --> 00:44:31,215
at 4:20am this morning.

1222
00:44:32,126 --> 00:44:34,890
When we get home... Can we even go home?

1223
00:44:34,895 --> 00:44:37,725
Gosh. What should we do?

1224
00:44:37,731 --> 00:44:39,430
We're working too much.

1225
00:44:39,433 --> 00:44:40,800
(Exhausted)

1226
00:44:40,801 --> 00:44:43,200
How many part-time jobs are we doing today?

1227
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:44,570
What did I do wrong?

1228
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:46,000
You didn't do anything wrong.

1229
00:44:46,006 --> 00:44:47,140
What did I do wrong?

1230
00:44:47,141 --> 00:44:48,740
On the boat...

1231
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:50,710
I took all the flatfish out of the net.

1232
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:52,310
The captain did most of the work.

1233
00:44:52,313 --> 00:44:55,275
You just held up the fish in front of the cameras.

1234
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:58,845
The viewers don't know.

1235
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:03,690
(The viewers found out today.)

1236
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:05,190
(I worked hard.)

1237
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:06,885
I'm tired.

1238
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:08,560
I'm so tired.

1239
00:45:08,562 --> 00:45:11,860

1241
00:45:18,005 --> 00:45:20,270
Let's play 1-on-1 games.

1242
00:45:20,274 --> 00:45:21,540
First of all...

1243
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:23,240
- I'll be in the room. - Wait in the room.

1244
00:45:23,243 --> 00:45:26,310
We're going to play escape room.

1245
00:45:26,313 --> 00:45:28,280
I'll do a quiz.

1246
00:45:28,282 --> 00:45:29,780
Se Chan and Haha were bragging...

1247
00:45:29,783 --> 00:45:31,950
about their knowledge.

1248
00:45:31,952 --> 00:45:33,720
- I'll do a puzzle. - What do you mean?

1249
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:35,215
What do you mean?

1250
00:45:35,222 --> 00:45:37,320
I'll make a drawing and rip it up.

1251
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:40,485
He has to put the pieces back together in time.

1252
00:45:40,661 --> 00:45:43,260
What about this? You call Byul,

1253
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:45,430
and she has to say certain words.

1254
00:45:45,432 --> 00:45:47,925
(Byul has to say certain words on the phone.)

1255
00:45:48,002 --> 00:45:49,700
Je Sung, you should do one too.

1256
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:50,800
Should I try "Tazzang"?

1257
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:52,400
It's so funny.

1258
00:45:52,406 --> 00:45:54,340
- Should I put on funny makeup? - Sounds good.

1259
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:55,970
I'll have my back turned.

1260
00:45:55,976 --> 00:45:59,405
When I turn around, Haha shouldn't laugh.

1261
00:45:59,546 --> 00:46:01,580
But you can take it easy.

1262
00:46:01,582 --> 00:46:03,575
Haha will fail in the last stage anyway.

1263
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:05,050
(I'll use my strength.)

1264
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:06,350
You'll be there.

1265
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:07,920
I'll make him remove my name tag.

1266
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:10,145
(It'll be a name tag elimination.)

Haha's escape room.

1272
00:46:20,501 --> 00:46:21,600
I've always wanted to try it.

1273
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:24,770
- The first is Se Chan's room. - My room? Okay.

Here's what I will do.

1285
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,730
I wanted to use this.

1286

I didn't know when.

Yes, here's my question.

1289

They're very meticulous. They're the brothers of Yang family.

1291
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:10,875
"Paper cups and chicken towel".

1292
00:47:11,685 --> 00:47:13,475
Wait.

1293
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:15,720
(What's the question?)

1294
00:47:15,722 --> 00:47:17,090
Wait.

1295
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:18,290
No way.

1296
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,590
"Chicken towel".

1297
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:20,860

1298
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:21,860
Wait.

00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:34,440
(Something seems to be off.)

1303
00:47:34,441 --> 00:47:37,310
- Hold on. - So what's the problem here?

1304
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:39,110
What's the problem here?

1305

There's a word that's incorrect.

- Answer in five seconds. - What's the incorrect word?

1307
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:46,250
- 5, 4, 3. - Oh, no.

1308
00:47:46,253 --> 00:47:47,920
- Two. - Do you really not know?

1309
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,350
- My goodness. - Does it include all?

1310
00:47:49,356 --> 00:47:51,720
Why is it wrong? Who wrote it? Did you write it?

1311
00:47:51,725 --> 00:47:53,760
- No. - Yang Se...

1312
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,660
- I didn't write it either. - It must be your brother.

1313
00:47:55,662 --> 00:47:59,130
Will you blame your brother?

1314
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:01,825
Or will you take the blame?

1315
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,870
From the Yang family,

1316
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:08,065
one of the brothers is ignorant.

1317
00:48:08,342 --> 00:48:09,840
Will you shame your brother?

1318
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,610
Leave my family alone!

1319
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:14,780
Or will he shame himself?

1320
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:15,880
My goodness.

1321
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:18,650
- I had no idea. - My goodness.

1322
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:20,450
This is very extreme.

1323
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:22,950
Wait, I can't shame my brother.

1324
00:48:22,956 --> 00:48:24,120
Do you know the correct word?

1325
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:26,090
- Of course. - Do you?

1326
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:27,560
What is it?

1327
00:48:27,561 --> 00:48:28,790
It's kitchen towel.

1328
00:48:28,795 --> 00:48:31,530
So write down that word.

1329
00:48:31,532 --> 00:48:33,160
(Write down the word.)

1330
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,900
Kitchen towel? He must know.

1331
00:48:34,902 --> 00:48:36,500
- Haha. - This is nothing.

1332
00:48:36,503 --> 00:48:39,170
We learned it in middle school or in elementary school.

1333
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:40,370
- You know it, right? - Yes.

1334
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:42,765
You need to write the correct answer.

1335
00:48:42,976 --> 00:48:45,640
Yes, that's right.

1336
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:47,410
He's right.

1337
00:48:47,414 --> 00:48:48,580
What's this?

1338
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:50,550
- You should know it yourself. - What's wrong with you?

1339
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,550
You need to write the correct answer first.

1340
00:48:52,553 --> 00:48:53,820
- All right. - Let's do it at the same time.

1341
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,520
Write it at the same time.

1342
00:48:55,522 --> 00:48:59,420
- Gosh. - That's how it is.

1343
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:00,990
This is driving me crazy.

1344
00:49:00,994 --> 00:49:02,790
This is so funny.

1345
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:04,430
- It's so funny. - Ji Hyo is laughing.

1346
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:05,530
Give her a piece of paper too.

1347
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:07,400
- I know it. - Ji Hyo.

1348
00:49:07,401 --> 00:49:09,130
- Can you write it? - I cook.

1349
00:49:09,136 --> 00:49:10,700
- You know kitchen towel. - Of course.

1350
00:49:10,704 --> 00:49:12,270
I know how to write it.

1351
00:49:12,272 --> 00:49:13,770
They might see it.

1352
00:49:13,774 --> 00:49:17,210
They might see it. Lean back. That's right.

1353
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:18,910
- You mean in English? - In English.

1354
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,510
(She's surprised.)

1355
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:21,980
(She gets up.)

1356
00:49:21,982 --> 00:49:23,480
"In English"?

1357
00:49:23,483 --> 00:49:24,750
Wait.

1358
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,280
- In English? - Yes.

1359
00:49:26,286 --> 00:49:27,950
I didn't know I had to.

1360
00:49:27,955 --> 00:49:30,020
It could be confusing.

1361
00:49:30,023 --> 00:49:31,390
That's enough, Ji Hyo!

1362
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,820
(He takes it away from her.)

1363
00:49:32,826 --> 00:49:34,260
(Friendly Jong Kook stops her.)

1364
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:35,960
- Don't do it. - Is it wrong?

1365
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:38,560
Don't do it. Don't do it, Ji Hyo.

1366
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:41,000
Ji Hyo was cute. "You mean in English?"

1367
00:49:41,001 --> 00:49:43,395
Gosh, I didn't know.

1368
00:49:43,403 --> 00:49:44,970
(All is new to him.)

1369
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:47,370
Gosh, this one is quite serious.

1370
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:49,670
- Let me see. - I'm so bad at English.

1371
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:52,410
(As it's a super match, the competition is fierce.)

1372
00:49:52,412 --> 00:49:53,510
I don't know.

1373
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:54,880
Let's take a look.

1374
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:56,480
We'll take a look at the same time.

1375
00:49:56,483 --> 00:49:59,175
1, 2...

1376
00:50:00,254 --> 00:50:05,285
(What will be the result of the first round?)

1377
00:50:08,362 --> 00:50:14,895
(The correct answer is "kitchen towel".)

1378
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:17,270
- It's wrong. - Is it wrong?

1379
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:19,570
Come on.

1380
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:21,170
(He had no idea that they were this bad.)

1381
00:50:21,174 --> 00:50:23,240
- "Kitchen"? - Come on.

1382
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:25,610
- What should we do with you? - Isn't this correct?

1383
00:50:25,612 --> 00:50:27,305
Yes.

1384
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,180
Did I get "towel" wrong?

1385
00:50:29,182 --> 00:50:31,175
Is it with an A?

1386
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:33,480
Don't you know "towel"?

1387
00:50:33,487 --> 00:50:36,215
I call it "towol".

1388
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:38,515
"Give me some kitchen towols."

1389
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:40,560
"Towol"?

1390
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,060
Both of you were wrong. What's the second question?

1391
00:50:44,064 --> 00:50:46,230
No one scored. Both got the first question wrong.

1392
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:48,830
- At least, I kept my pride. - It's neck and neck.

1393
00:50:48,835 --> 00:50:50,600
- What's the second one? - Were you surprised?

1394
00:50:50,604 --> 00:50:53,270
- I was. - We aren't on the same level.

1395
00:50:53,273 --> 00:50:55,340
- I don't know yet. - Let's shake hands.

1396
00:50:55,342 --> 00:50:56,835
(Let's shake hands.)

1397
00:50:56,843 --> 00:50:59,310
- Learn English from me. - I will learn from you.

1398
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:00,880
You can teach me something else.

1399
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:02,410
Haha is better at English.

1400
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,650
Here's the question.

1401
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,650
This is common sense that I know.

1402
00:51:05,652 --> 00:51:07,520
- Be careful what you ask. - Be careful.

1403
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,020
This is something that's easy for those who know.

1404
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:13,690
Those who don't know won't have a clue.

1405
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:15,090
- That's how it is. - Be careful what you ask.

1406
00:51:15,095 --> 00:51:18,360
It's a treatment effect based on trust.

1407
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:20,030
What effect is it?

1408
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:23,700
- Does that exist? - A treatment based on trust?

1409
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:25,770
Those who don't know don't know.

1410
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:27,840
To me, it's common sense.

1411
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:29,640
I know what it is. I'll write it down.

1412
00:51:29,643 --> 00:51:32,240
- A treatment based on trust? - Yes.

1413
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:33,580
(What is a treatment effect based on trust?)

1414
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,310
(I definitely know what it is.)

1415
00:51:35,315 --> 00:51:37,050
You'll recognize it when you see it.

1416
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:39,950
It's at the level of middle school students.

1417
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:42,450
I don't think he knows.

1418
00:51:42,456 --> 00:51:43,990
It will hurt his pride.

1419
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,590
It's 1 of the 2.

1420
00:51:45,592 --> 00:51:47,860
(Stuttering)

1421
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:48,960
(I won this round.)

1422
00:51:48,962 --> 00:51:50,960
Okay, I got one question.

1423
00:51:50,964 --> 00:51:52,660
Write down the question.

1424
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,395
How many words?

1425
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,795
I'll write 3 or 4.

1426
00:51:57,104 --> 00:51:58,670
3 or 4?

1427
00:51:58,672 --> 00:51:59,770
It could be that.

1428
00:51:59,773 --> 00:52:01,440
I want to keep my pride.

1429
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:02,940
He might lose against me.

1430
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,710
- Try to keep your pride. - Okay.

1431
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:06,210
He's filled with a brave spirit.

1432
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:07,780
(Brave and confident)

1433
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:11,350
For example, Jong Kook caught a cold.

1434
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:13,450
- He caught a cold. - You're giving him too much.

1435
00:52:13,453 --> 00:52:15,520
- I know. - Should I stop?

1436
00:52:15,522 --> 00:52:16,820
It's over once you give him a hint.

1437
00:52:16,823 --> 00:52:18,890
Is it convincing yourself that you didn't catch a cold?

1438
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:22,660
(Something lights up in him.)

1439
00:52:22,662 --> 00:52:24,730
(Did Haha sense something from the hint?)

1440
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,425
Did I tell him too much?

1441
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:30,195
I've heard of it.

1442
00:52:30,203 --> 00:52:32,070
You should know this.

1443
00:52:32,072 --> 00:52:35,070
- What? - You aren't an easy opponent.

1444
00:52:35,075 --> 00:52:38,210
(Haha finally approves of him.)

1445
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:40,780
Do you mean me? Haha.

1446
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:41,980
- You could win. - I knew it.

1447
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:43,080
I approve of you too.

1448
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,880
I don't care to know more.

1449
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:46,920
Okay, you aren't easy either.

1450
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,715
I'm starting to sweat.

1451
00:52:49,055 --> 00:52:51,985
- This game is so fun. - Right.

1452
00:52:52,392 --> 00:52:55,160
(He writes without hesitating.)

1453
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:56,460
- I think... - The game is fun.

1454
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:58,330
when I joined Running Man...

1455
00:52:58,331 --> 00:53:01,200
(Here. This is my answer.)

1456
00:53:01,201 --> 00:53:03,600
- He threw it. - He threw it down.

1457
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:04,770
All right.

1458
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:06,940
(What is a treatment effect based on trust?)

1459
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,340
Did he get it right?

1460
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:10,040
He got it right?

1461
00:53:10,043 --> 00:53:13,635
(Haha's answer is placebo effect, and it's correct.)

1462
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:16,180
(What do you think?)

1463
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,780
I shouldn't have mentioned the cold.

1464
00:53:17,784 --> 00:53:19,650
- That was too obvious. - I know.

1465
00:53:19,653 --> 00:53:22,245
I was going to write "flash mob".

1466
00:53:22,322 --> 00:53:25,520
(Flash mob for the cold)

1467
00:53:25,525 --> 00:53:27,160
It wasn't easy.

1468
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,190
You choose. Will it be about economy?

1469
00:53:29,196 --> 00:53:30,330
(Laughing)

1470
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:31,730
Is this funny?

1471
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:35,000
(Are we that funny?)

1472
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:36,530
How about current issues?

1473
00:53:36,536 --> 00:53:38,370
(He agrees on the race.)

1474
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:40,465
I'm confident with current issues.

1475
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:42,440
What do you think?

1476
00:53:42,442 --> 00:53:45,410
Were you going to ask about bus fares?

1477
00:53:45,412 --> 00:53:46,980
(It sounds like some difficult quiz.)

1478
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,475
I want to defeat you with a difficult question.

1479
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,245
Will you give me some time?

1480
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:54,545
I hope it will be as amazing as the time you took.

1481
00:53:55,255 --> 00:53:57,120
(Is that an encouragement or an attack?)

1482
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:59,990
(Someone from the audience wishes for that.)

1483
00:53:59,993 --> 00:54:01,590
This is my first time here.

1484
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:02,660
It's his first time.

1485
00:54:02,662 --> 00:54:03,860
- Aren't you nervous? - Yes.

1486
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:05,560
- By the way, - I know a few things.

1487
00:54:05,565 --> 00:54:07,325
what brings you here?

1488
00:54:07,634 --> 00:54:09,400
I came to sight-see.

1489
00:54:09,402 --> 00:54:11,265
- Did you? - Yes.

1490
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:12,800
They're good.

1491
00:54:12,806 --> 00:54:15,040
(They're good.)

1492
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,940
(His Korean skill is that of a Korean who lives abroad.)

1493
00:54:16,943 --> 00:54:18,910
- "They're good"? - They're good.

1494
00:54:18,912 --> 00:54:20,310
They're fun.

1495
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:22,180
- You speak Korean well. - Yes.

1496
00:54:22,182 --> 00:54:24,080
My grandmother is Korean.

1497
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:25,650
- Where are you from? - Your grandmother?

1498
00:54:25,652 --> 00:54:27,945
I'm from Philadelphia.

1499
00:54:27,954 --> 00:54:30,120
My grandmother is Korean.

1500
00:54:30,123 --> 00:54:31,120
(Philadelphia?)

1501
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:34,885
I don't know the exact spelling of "Philadelphia".

1502
00:54:35,562 --> 00:54:37,160
That's a bit too much.

1503
00:54:37,163 --> 00:54:39,460
- Right. - One English question is enough.

1504
00:54:39,466 --> 00:54:41,500
- Don't give an English question. - Okay.

1505
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:42,800
Okay, it's common sense.

1506
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,700
(Let's go with common sense.)

1507
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:48,070
- It's about capital cities. - "Capital cities"?

1508
00:54:48,074 --> 00:54:49,140
(Haha is experienced in this category.)

1509
00:54:49,142 --> 00:54:50,840
He won't know.

1510
00:54:50,844 --> 00:54:52,310
The capital city of India.

1511
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:54,580
(What's the capital city of India?)

1512
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:55,580
(It's a difficult question.)

1513
00:54:55,582 --> 00:54:58,845
- The capital city of India. - I don't have to write in English.

1514
00:54:58,852 --> 00:54:59,950
Right.

1515
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:01,815
(Try to guess the answer with them.)

1516
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:05,215
I didn't know the capital city of India.

1517
00:55:05,392 --> 00:55:06,390
(If this is wrong, I'm in trouble.)

1518
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:10,485
If... If this is wrong, I'm doomed.

1519
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:12,430
- One. - Put it closer.

1520
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:13,930
1, 2, 3.

1521
00:55:13,934 --> 00:55:16,030
(New Delhi and Delhi)

1522
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:17,400
That was close.

1523
00:55:17,404 --> 00:55:19,795
- It was close. - That was close.

1524
00:55:20,574 --> 00:55:25,710
(He only has one question left before he can escape.)

1525
00:55:25,712 --> 00:55:28,810
It has nothing to do with Deli Manju, right?

1526
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:31,050
(It has nothing to do with Deli Manju, right?)

1527
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:34,150
I'm not sure. It could be related.

1528
00:55:34,154 --> 00:55:35,820
Deli Manju.

1529
00:55:35,822 --> 00:55:37,520
Did you really not know?

1530
00:55:37,524 --> 00:55:39,120
- I didn't know. - Did you really not know?

1531
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:40,290
Should she know?

1532
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:41,560
He wrote "Delhi".

1533
00:55:41,561 --> 00:55:43,560
Connecting "Delhi" and Deli Manju...

1534
00:55:43,563 --> 00:55:45,225
Be quiet.

1535
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:50,895
(He's already sensitive as is.)

1536
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:54,940
How about this?

1537
00:55:54,941 --> 00:55:57,240
What are you confident about?

1538
00:55:57,243 --> 00:55:59,610
I don't know. I have no confidence anymore.

1539
00:55:59,613 --> 00:56:03,405
(He gives up on making questions.)

1540
00:56:03,883 --> 00:56:05,750
We started off wrong.

1541
00:56:05,752 --> 00:56:07,650
Everything went wrong since "chicken towel".

1542
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:10,515
- Are you going insane? - I think I'll lose.

1543
00:56:10,523 --> 00:56:12,120
I'll lose.

1544
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:14,190
- Okay. - How about this?

1545
00:56:14,194 --> 00:56:15,760
- Se Chan. - Ask him an easy one.

1546
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,930
- I'll give you a memory question. - That sounds good.

1547
00:56:17,931 --> 00:56:19,830
I prefer memory to common sense.

1548
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,695
Write "kitchen towel".

1549
00:56:22,102 --> 00:56:23,330
Write "kitchen towel".

1550
00:56:23,336 --> 00:56:25,295
(Write it again.)

1551
00:56:26,006 --> 00:56:29,770
(Stop mentioning "kitchen" again.)

1552
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:31,510
- Stop it. - Why?

1553
00:56:31,511 --> 00:56:34,205
- Stop it? - Why? It's a memory quiz.

1554
00:56:34,681 --> 00:56:35,810
It really is.

1555
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:37,280
- Good job. - Right? That works.

1556
00:56:37,283 --> 00:56:38,980
- Stop it. - You're smart.

1557
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:41,020
- That's hilarious. - I think you're a genius.

1558
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:44,015
I can't remember it again.

1559
00:56:44,491 --> 00:56:47,490
- You saw it before. - We showed you earlier.

1560
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:48,490
(Write "kitchen towel" in English again.)

1561
00:56:48,495 --> 00:56:49,560
(Se Chan is flustered. Haha will win.)

1562
00:56:49,562 --> 00:56:50,660
This is driving him nuts.

1563
00:56:50,664 --> 00:56:52,160
(Se Chan is flustered. Haha will win.)

1564
00:56:52,165 --> 00:56:54,625
Okay. "Kitchen towel".

1565
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:57,300
"Klcin".

1566
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:59,465
(It's obviously wrong.)

1567
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:01,540
Se Chan, you almost had it.

1568
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:05,410
From here, just memorize T and H.

1569
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,410
(I'll teach you.)

1570
00:57:06,413 --> 00:57:08,180
That's not right.

1571
00:57:08,181 --> 00:57:09,880
Teach me properly. What are you saying?

1572
00:57:09,883 --> 00:57:12,450
(Teach me properly. What are you saying?)

1573
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:13,920
(Se Chan explodes.)

1574
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,115
What? Where does the T go and where...

1575
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:19,885
does the H go? Tell me!

1576
00:57:21,561 --> 00:57:23,830
This is "kitchen". Okay?

1577
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,830
That's right.

1578
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:26,830
(Good work, brother.)

1579
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:28,930
- That was a great match. - I'm okay.

1580
00:57:28,935 --> 00:57:30,600
Things got heated up.

1581
00:57:30,603 --> 00:57:33,370
- That was so competitive. - Right.

1582
00:57:33,373 --> 00:57:35,270
- I have no regrets. - Hey,

1583
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,440
you should do this quarterly. Do it again next month.

1584
00:57:37,444 --> 00:57:40,910
I can study. Are we going to do English again?

1585
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:43,510
No, I have many more areas.

1586
00:57:43,516 --> 00:57:45,145
We can do history.

1587
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:51,315
(Haha solves the trivia questions, and he succeeds.)

1588
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:53,190
Can we finally do it?

1589
00:57:53,193 --> 00:57:55,790
When does the part-time job...

1590
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:58,730
(Busan's BIFF Square has many treats and things to see.)

1591
00:57:58,732 --> 00:58:02,500
(What kind of a part-time job will they have in the crowded area?)

1592
00:58:02,502 --> 00:58:06,270
All right, everybody. You have already completed...

1593
00:58:06,272 --> 00:58:07,870
3 out of 5 part-time jobs we had prepared.

1594
00:58:07,874 --> 00:58:09,540
There's 49 left.

1595
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:12,910
Busan, the city of culture and arts, is where many people visit daily.

1596
00:58:12,912 --> 00:58:16,495
In Busan Gukje Market, you will be...

1597
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:19,850
3 out of 5 part-time jobs we had prepared.

1598
00:58:19,853 --> 00:58:21,520
There's 49 left.

1599
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:24,890
Busan, the city of culture and arts, is where many people visit daily.

1600
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:28,260
In Busan Gukje Market, you will be...

1601
00:58:28,261 --> 00:58:30,230
drawing caricature portraits of people.

1602
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:33,715
(Caricature Portraits)

1603
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:37,800
(It's a drawing where certain characteristics are exaggerated.)

1604
00:58:37,804 --> 00:58:41,715
(People in Busan will be forced to take them.)

1605
00:58:41,808 --> 00:58:45,710
Your pay will be based on how many portraits you draw.

1606
00:58:45,712 --> 00:58:48,940
However, if they say it doesn't look like them...

1607
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:50,550
or if they get angry, it doesn't count.

1608
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,880
They are the two people I know who are the worst at drawing.

1609
00:58:53,887 --> 00:58:55,620
(They can't do this job.)

1610
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:56,680
They're worse than infants.

1611
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,990
- Listen. - Kwang Soo can draw.

1612
00:58:58,992 --> 00:59:01,635
- This doesn't make any sense. - Goodness.

1613
00:59:01,995 --> 00:59:03,890
If we draw 1 portrait, is that counted as 1?

1614
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:06,130
- Yes. - It'll take forever to draw 49.

1615
00:59:06,132 --> 00:59:07,960
We can't make 49 portraits.

1616
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:09,230
(This won't work out.)

1617
00:59:09,235 --> 00:59:10,700
If so,

1618
00:59:10,703 --> 00:59:13,170
you can find any part-time jobs you desire.

1619
00:59:13,173 --> 00:59:15,900
(You can find any part-time jobs you desire.)

1620
00:59:15,909 --> 00:59:18,610
- There's nothing we can do. - What can we do?

1621
00:59:18,611 --> 00:59:19,710
I'm speechless.

1622
00:59:19,712 --> 00:59:21,340
What are we supposed to do here?

1623
00:59:21,347 --> 00:59:23,440
- He's not letting us go home. - He's not.

1624
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,480
- We're in Busan... - You already made up your mind.

1625
00:59:25,485 --> 00:59:27,580
Am I supposed to complain as well?

1626
00:59:27,587 --> 00:59:29,750
(Hold on a second.)

1627
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:32,390
Am I supposed to talk about my misfortunes as well?

1628
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:35,835
I thought about it. Why would I draw?

1629
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:37,630
Why would I draw portraits?

1630
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:40,730
You're the best at drawing out of us three.

1631
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:41,730
But...

1632
00:59:41,734 --> 00:59:44,030
There's no other way. We can't find any part-time jobs.

1633
00:59:44,037 --> 00:59:45,600
We can't find anything.

1634
00:59:45,605 --> 00:59:49,085
- Let's just draw portraits then. - But I can't draw.

1635
00:59:49,442 --> 00:59:52,440
- Me neither. - Do we sit here and draw?

1636
00:59:52,445 --> 00:59:55,695
Will people let us draw portraits of them?

1637
00:59:56,783 --> 00:59:58,525
Seok Jin,

1638
00:59:59,619 --> 01:00:02,150
we'll start drawing here,

1639
01:00:02,155 --> 01:00:05,490
so you can go around and draw.

1640
01:00:05,491 --> 01:00:08,220
Okay, but it'll be weird...

1641
01:00:08,228 --> 01:00:11,030
to walk around all of a sudden.

1642
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,915
(Loitering)

1643
01:00:15,802 --> 01:00:20,415
- Hey, hey. - Kwang Soo is handsome.

1644
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,740
I told you.

1645
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:23,640
(Whispering)

1646
01:00:23,643 --> 01:00:25,410
Let's steal his sock.

1647
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:28,240
- We can't end this otherwise. - When?

1648
01:00:28,248 --> 01:00:30,850
If we steal his sock and leave,

1649
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:33,510
- does he have to do the rest? - Yes.

1650
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,595
(That's very nice.)

1651
01:00:37,056 --> 01:00:39,235
This is not your punishment.

1652
01:00:39,325 --> 01:00:41,490
I just need you...

1653
01:00:41,494 --> 01:00:44,505
- to slap my forehead. - Right. You just come with me.

1654
01:00:44,764 --> 01:00:47,030
We can't draw 49 portraits.

1655
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:49,330
- It doesn't make sense. - It doesn't.

1656
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:50,400
It doesn't.

1657
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:52,385
(They make another plan since they think this is hopeless.)

1658
01:00:52,705 --> 01:00:54,070
- Excuse me. - You scared me.

1659
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:57,385
Are you looking for a part-timer?

1660
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,940
I want to do a different job. I can't draw.

1661
01:01:00,947 --> 01:01:02,040
Are you looking for a part-timer?

1662
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:03,510
We're not, but the pancake place is.

1663
01:01:03,516 --> 01:01:05,480
The pancakes? Do you want me to sell them for you?

1664
01:01:05,485 --> 01:01:07,020
Sure. Go ahead.

1665
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,880
Would you like me to sell them for you?

1666
01:01:08,888 --> 01:01:12,605
- Yes. - Each one I sell counts as one.

1667
01:01:12,892 --> 01:01:14,605
For each one I sell, right?

1668
01:01:14,994 --> 01:01:16,930
Look at these pancakes. How much are they?

1669
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:19,130
- 1.30 dollars. - 1.30 dollars?

1670
01:01:19,132 --> 01:01:21,330
- Can we have a sale for a dollar? - Sure.

1671
01:01:21,334 --> 01:01:23,175
Is that okay? All right.

1672
01:01:23,269 --> 01:01:26,870
All right! Pancakes that are usually 1.30 dollars...

1673
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:30,055
are being sold for a dollar each.

1674
01:01:30,476 --> 01:01:33,240
Come here. They're a dollar each.

1675
01:01:33,246 --> 01:01:34,240
(Busan's specialty pancakes are on a flash sales.)

1676
01:01:34,247 --> 01:01:36,025
Come here.

1677
01:01:36,616 --> 01:01:39,510
It's on sale for a dollar each. It's a special sale.

1678
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:42,950
These pancakes are really good.

1679
01:01:42,956 --> 01:01:43,950
Let's take a picture.

1680
01:01:43,957 --> 01:01:46,265
(You get to take a picture with the part-timer.)

1681
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:48,390
Okay. Enjoy.

1682
01:01:48,394 --> 01:01:51,390
- I always watch you on TV. - Thank you. It's a dollar each.

1683
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:53,960
Please get a pancake.

1684
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,400
- Here. - I'd like two.

1685
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:58,630
2? She'd like 2.

1686
01:01:58,638 --> 01:02:00,000
- Would you like it in a bag? - Yes.

1687
01:02:00,006 --> 01:02:02,440
Would you like it in a bag? Sure.

1688
01:02:02,442 --> 01:02:04,840
(He'll finish up in no time.)

1689
01:02:04,844 --> 01:02:07,325
- It looks great. - Thank you.

1690
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,840
Pancakes.

1691
01:02:08,848 --> 01:02:09,840
(However...)

1692
01:02:09,849 --> 01:02:11,910
Pancakes.

1693
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:14,420
They're a dollar each. Have one.

1694
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,165
Pancakes. Have some.

1695
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:22,260
Come here. Take one.

1696
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:25,160
Here you go. Thank you.

1697
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:27,630
- Here you go. - It's a dollar each.

1698
01:02:27,633 --> 01:02:31,000
Pancakes are on a limited-time sale for a dollar each.

1699
01:02:31,004 --> 01:02:34,440
They're usually 1.30 dollars, but they're a dollar.

1700
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,870
Pancakes.

1701
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:40,340
Pancakes are on sale for a dollar each.

1702
01:02:40,346 --> 01:02:43,240
You can take a picture with me as well. Here you go.

1703
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:44,780
They're a dollar each.

1704
01:02:44,784 --> 01:02:46,480
This is so tiring.

1705
01:02:46,486 --> 01:02:48,295
How many did I sell?

1706
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:50,590
I'm going to practice first.

1707
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:51,990
(Kwang Soo and Jae Seok are practicing.)

1708
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:53,790
Let me draw Kwon Ryeol.

1709
01:02:53,793 --> 01:02:56,035
I need to practice.

1710
01:02:56,596 --> 01:02:57,690
(He doesn't hesitate.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1711
01:02:57,697 --> 01:02:58,690
Then...

1712
01:02:58,698 --> 01:03:01,015
(He doesn't hesitate.)

1713
01:03:03,436 --> 01:03:04,730
What are you doing?

1714
01:03:04,737 --> 01:03:06,730
- This is Kwon Ryeol. - What are you doing?

1715
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:07,770
It's him.

1716
01:03:07,774 --> 01:03:09,485
(Kwon Ryeol, Jae Seok's cameraman)

1717
01:03:11,177 --> 01:03:12,240
It's kind of similar.

1718
01:03:12,245 --> 01:03:13,440
- It's similar, right? - Yes.

1719
01:03:13,446 --> 01:03:15,280
- Kwon Ryeol. - I can tell that it's him.

1720
01:03:15,281 --> 01:03:18,010
I drew a portrait of you before officially starting.

1721
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:19,980
(I drew a portrait of you before officially starting.)

1722
01:03:19,986 --> 01:03:21,820
(Laughing)

1723
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,520
- What do you think? - Fail.

1724
01:03:23,523 --> 01:03:26,990
If we ask the others, they're going to say it's you.

1725
01:03:26,993 --> 01:03:28,690
Then I'll approve.

1726
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:30,060
Will this approve as one?

1727
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:31,945
I will.

1728
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:35,275
He's handsome.

1729
01:03:35,435 --> 01:03:38,370
I drew a portrait...

1730
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:41,040
of somebody here. Who do you think this is?

1731
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,340
(Let's see.)

1732
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:45,185
(She points at him.)

1733
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:48,725
(You, Kwon Ryeol.)

1734
01:03:49,015 --> 01:03:51,480
See? Did you see that?

1735
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:53,610
- Did you see that? - Jae Seok.

1736
01:03:53,619 --> 01:03:55,480
He drew better than I thought, so I was surprised.

1737
01:03:55,488 --> 01:03:57,620
- I... - It's bad, but it's Kwon Ryeol.

1738
01:03:57,623 --> 01:03:59,920
It looks like a bad drawing of Kwon Ryeol.

1739
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:01,220
It's you, though.

1740
01:04:01,227 --> 01:04:03,260
- It has to be him. - These are your pants too.

1741
01:04:03,262 --> 01:04:05,490
- I'll approve this as one. - Okay.

1742
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:08,860
Recruit a random person and draw a portrait of them.

1743
01:04:08,868 --> 01:04:12,385
- They might get mad at us. - We don't have any skills.

1744
01:04:12,905 --> 01:04:14,970
We are drawing caricatures.

1745
01:04:14,974 --> 01:04:19,485
Can somebody be my model? I just need one person.

1746
01:04:19,545 --> 01:04:21,240
I need one person with unique features.

1747
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,640
- Me. - Can I have you come up?

1748
01:04:23,649 --> 01:04:25,510
Just one person. Okay.

1749
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:27,120
- Thank you. - Sure.

1750
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:30,520
Would you like to try? Please come here.

1751
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:32,820
I'm not a great artist.

1752
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:34,920
- Please keep that in mind. - Okay.

1753
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:36,790
I'm asking you for a favor.

1754
01:04:36,796 --> 01:04:37,830
(They start drawing.)

1755
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,075
Please have a seat.

1756
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,900
I'm not a great artist, so please be understanding.

1757
01:04:42,902 --> 01:04:43,930
(He apologizes in advance.)

1758
01:04:43,936 --> 01:04:46,145
I've never done this before.

1759
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,240
Have you done this before?

1760
01:04:49,242 --> 01:04:51,585
- No. - No, right?

1761
01:04:51,777 --> 01:04:54,125
I'll try my best.

1762
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:57,350
I'm paying attention...

1763
01:04:57,350 --> 01:04:58,410
(He's all talk.)

1764
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,310
I'm focusing on the shape of your face.

1765
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:01,750
This is a piece of art.

1766
01:05:01,754 --> 01:05:03,080
(It looks okay so far.)

1767
01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:04,820
Can you make my face narrow?

1768
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:06,020
Do you want it narrow?

1769
01:05:06,025 --> 01:05:09,035
(I trust you, Artist Yu.)

1770
01:05:09,595 --> 01:05:10,790
What is your name?

1771
01:05:10,796 --> 01:05:12,030
Park Sun Ha.

1772
01:05:12,031 --> 01:05:13,460
- Sorry? - It's Park Sun Ha.

1773
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:15,045
- Sun Ha? - Yes.

1774
01:05:15,234 --> 01:05:17,800
You're supposed to exaggerate when drawing caricatures.

1775
01:05:17,803 --> 01:05:19,130
Right?

1776
01:05:19,138 --> 01:05:21,370
If I was good at this,

1777
01:05:21,374 --> 01:05:23,355
I'd be drawing exactly the way you look,

1778
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:24,840
but my skills...

1779
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:26,325
(What kind of exaggerations is he talking about?)

1780
01:05:27,113 --> 01:05:28,210
(While they're busy drawing...)

1781
01:05:28,214 --> 01:05:29,240
Hey.

1782
01:05:29,248 --> 01:05:30,680
- Did you draw any? - Hey.

1783
01:05:30,683 --> 01:05:32,450
I got 10.

1784
01:05:32,451 --> 01:05:35,120
- What? 10 what? - I got 10.

1785
01:05:35,121 --> 01:05:36,850
I sold... 10...

1786
01:05:36,856 --> 01:05:38,750
- I sold 10 pancakes. - Really?

1787
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,020
Did you sell pancakes?

1788
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:41,420
You're good.

1789
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:42,920
(It wasn't easy to sell pancakes, so he joins them.)

1790
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,845
I'm going to draw too.

1791
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:46,290
Who thinks they're easy to draw?

1792
01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:48,930
- Me. - Me.

1793
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:50,800
(He picks somebody who's easy to draw.)

1794
01:05:50,803 --> 01:05:52,470
We already have two ladies, so come over here.

1795
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:54,840
(He recruits a person.)

1796
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,240
Hey.

1797
01:05:56,242 --> 01:05:58,040
It'll take forever to finish.

1798
01:05:58,044 --> 01:05:59,070
Goodness.

1799
01:05:59,078 --> 01:06:01,110
(Draw if you have time to talk.)

1800
01:06:01,113 --> 01:06:03,880
This is not hard. You have a single eyelid.

1801
01:06:03,883 --> 01:06:06,525
You have one double eyelid.

1802
01:06:07,386 --> 01:06:10,080
(He doesn't hesitate.)

1803
01:06:10,089 --> 01:06:11,720
Okay. I'm done.

1804
01:06:11,724 --> 01:06:14,720
(Okay. I'm done.)

1805
01:06:14,727 --> 01:06:16,020
Hurry.

1806
01:06:16,028 --> 01:06:17,730
What are you doing?

1807
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,760
- I'm done. - What are you doing?

1808
01:06:19,765 --> 01:06:21,815
I'm done.

1809
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:23,600
What are you doing?

1810
01:06:23,603 --> 01:06:25,815
(Ta-da)

1811
01:06:25,972 --> 01:06:27,670
Please say this looks like you.

1812
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:28,900
- Doesn't this look like you? - Does it?

1813
01:06:28,908 --> 01:06:30,040
- Doesn't it? - You think so?

1814
01:06:30,042 --> 01:06:31,770
It looks like you.

1815
01:06:31,777 --> 01:06:33,610
I'll sign it.

1816
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:35,510
What's that?

1817
01:06:35,514 --> 01:06:37,380
(I can't believe him.)

1818
01:06:37,383 --> 01:06:38,850
- So Hee. - Yes?

1819
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:41,835
I'm finished, but don't be startled.

1820
01:06:42,455 --> 01:06:45,120
- Well... - Is she a grandma?

1821
01:06:45,124 --> 01:06:47,305
(Is this a portrait of a grandma?)

1822
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,190
You drew a grandma.

1823
01:06:50,196 --> 01:06:51,730
(Calm down.)

1824
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:52,990
- So Hee. - Yes?

1825
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:54,930
- Look at it with your heart. - Okay.

1826
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:55,930
Please close your eyes.

1827
01:06:55,935 --> 01:06:58,130
Tell me whether you like it or not.

1828
01:06:58,137 --> 01:06:59,170
(She closes her eyes and calms herself down.)

1829
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:03,315
(Such an experience is a first for both of them.)

1830
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:06,070
(Among a crowd of people,)

1831
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:09,425
(she was willing to help Jae Seok.)

1832
01:07:14,153 --> 01:07:15,620
- This looks... - Pardon?

1833
01:07:15,621 --> 01:07:16,620
(She can't speak.)

1834
01:07:16,622 --> 01:07:17,690
What do you think?

1835
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:19,820
- I think it looks similar... - Mine looks better.

1836
01:07:19,825 --> 01:07:21,590
- Hey. Look. - Hold on.

1837
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,675
I took no time at all. Come here.

1838
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:26,760
- This looks like him. - But he looks so depressed.

1839
01:07:26,766 --> 01:07:27,960
Don't you like it though?

1840
01:07:27,967 --> 01:07:29,500
Yes, I think this looks better than me.

1841
01:07:29,502 --> 01:07:31,470
- See? - What?

1842
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:33,030
- Hold on. - My customer is satisfied.

1843
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,940
I shouldn't have done this.

1844
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:37,000
This... This is...

1845
01:07:37,009 --> 01:07:39,570
I should erase this.

1846
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:41,080
Wait.

1847
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,780
Do you have an eraser?

1848
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:44,050
What am I supposed to do?

1849
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,850
(Kwang Soo is taking longer than expected.)

1850
01:07:46,852 --> 01:07:48,720
- I'm done... - Yes.

1851
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:50,790
- Can you show me? - Doesn't this look like you?

1852
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:52,150
Hey, how long...

1853
01:07:52,158 --> 01:07:53,735
Hey.

1854
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:57,105
(Here it is...)

1855
01:08:00,833 --> 01:08:03,630
- Hey, why did you draw a grandma? - No, no.

1856
01:08:03,636 --> 01:08:05,200
This is supposed to be exaggerated.

1857
01:08:05,204 --> 01:08:07,200
- Do you have an eraser? - What?

1858
01:08:07,206 --> 01:08:08,540
What is that?

1859
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:12,670
- What's this? You can't do this. - Is this bad?

1860
01:08:12,678 --> 01:08:14,080
- I tried my best. - It's okay.

1861
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,410
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

1862
01:08:16,415 --> 01:08:18,480
You're much more beautiful than this.

1863
01:08:18,484 --> 01:08:20,080
- You don't look like this, - It's okay.

1864
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:22,565
- but I'm bad at drawing. - It's fine.

1865
01:08:22,722 --> 01:08:24,920
- Are you giving this to me? - Yes.

1866
01:08:24,924 --> 01:08:28,535
(She's going to keep it.)

1867
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:30,460
- Thank you. - If I had more time...

1868
01:08:30,463 --> 01:08:32,260
- It's okay. Thank you. - Thank you.

1869
01:08:32,264 --> 01:08:34,445
Take care. Thank you.

1870
01:08:36,102 --> 01:08:38,500
Look. This is good.

1871
01:08:38,504 --> 01:08:39,930
Put it close to your face.

1872
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:42,440
(This is the best picture of him.)

1873
01:08:42,441 --> 01:08:43,640
- So Hee. - Yes.

1874
01:08:43,642 --> 01:08:45,555
I don't think...

1875
01:08:45,678 --> 01:08:48,610
I should have drawn the smile lines. You should erase this, okay?

1876
01:08:48,614 --> 01:08:51,350
This is my first drawing.

1877
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,880
- Thank you very much. - Sure thing.

1878
01:08:52,885 --> 01:08:55,950
Please keep this with you.

1879
01:08:55,955 --> 01:08:58,235
- I'll frame it. - You will?

1880
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:01,635
So Hee, thank you. You must be busy.

1881
01:09:02,728 --> 01:09:04,730
(There are 35 left.)

1882
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,160
You can't draw like that.

1883
01:09:06,165 --> 01:09:09,130
I don't think she was happy with it.

1884
01:09:09,135 --> 01:09:11,370
This is difficult to do.

1885
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:12,500
Draw me.

1886
01:09:12,505 --> 01:09:13,970
(Somebody speaks.)

1887
01:09:13,973 --> 01:09:16,370
Would you like me to? Come here. I'll draw you.

1888
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:18,540
(She volunteers even after seeing the previous portraits.)

1889
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:20,640
Please sit down. Come here.

1890
01:09:20,646 --> 01:09:22,510
I'm not a great artist.

1891
01:09:22,515 --> 01:09:23,740
Would you like me to draw you, kid?

1892
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:25,110
Would you like me to draw you?

1893
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:26,550
- Would you like me to? - Please stay still.

1894
01:09:26,552 --> 01:09:27,850
- Would you like me to? - Yes.

1895
01:09:27,853 --> 01:09:28,950
Okay, have a seat.

1896
01:09:28,954 --> 01:09:32,105
(Kwang Soo recruits a child model.)

1897
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:34,390
What is your name?

1898
01:09:34,393 --> 01:09:36,505
- Lee Hae Joon. - Hae Joon?

1899
01:09:37,062 --> 01:09:39,975
I don't have too much time,

1900
01:09:40,232 --> 01:09:42,360
but I'll try my best.

1901
01:09:42,368 --> 01:09:44,130
(Will he be able to recover his reputation?)

1902
01:09:44,136 --> 01:09:46,970
My drawings are pretty realistic.

1903
01:09:46,972 --> 01:09:48,470
- Please keep that in mind. - Okay.

1904
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:50,810
(Realistic?)

1905
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:54,010
- Focus on the special features. - I'll do that.

1906
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:57,525
- This is for you. - That's good.

1907
01:09:57,683 --> 01:10:00,325
I don't know if you'll like this.

1908
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:05,750
(She looks like a criminal.)

1909
01:10:05,758 --> 01:10:07,490
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

1910
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:08,690
You said it'd look cute.

1911
01:10:08,694 --> 01:10:11,075
I tried to make it look cute.

1912
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:13,230
This looks really scary.

1913
01:10:13,232 --> 01:10:14,845
How does it look?

1914
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,315
That scared me.

1915
01:10:17,336 --> 01:10:19,870
- What is this? - Yu Jin...

1916
01:10:19,872 --> 01:10:21,670
wanted me to make it cute.

1917
01:10:21,674 --> 01:10:23,340
- This... - It looks scary.

1918
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:25,770
- What is this? - This looks really scary.

1919
01:10:25,778 --> 01:10:27,440
I'm sorry. I wanted to make it look good.

1920
01:10:27,446 --> 01:10:28,910
I really like it.

1921
01:10:28,914 --> 01:10:30,240
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

1922
01:10:30,249 --> 01:10:32,180
I'm sorry.

1923
01:10:32,184 --> 01:10:33,280
This...

1924
01:10:33,285 --> 01:10:34,950
(Laughing)

1925
01:10:34,954 --> 01:10:37,720
- I'm sorry. - I'm finished.

1926
01:10:37,723 --> 01:10:39,265
Do you want to see?

1927
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:40,935
Do you want to see it?

1928
01:10:43,128 --> 01:10:44,705
Do you want to see it?

1929
01:10:46,165 --> 01:10:47,330
(This is a kid?)

1930
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:48,460
What do you think?

1931
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:49,660
(This is a kid?)

1932
01:10:49,668 --> 01:10:51,315
What do you think?

1933
01:10:52,104 --> 01:10:53,200
What do you think?

1934
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:55,670
(What am I looking at?)

1935
01:10:55,674 --> 01:10:56,870
Do you like it?

1936
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:59,455
What are you doing?

1937
01:10:59,845 --> 01:11:02,280
- This is Hae Joon. No. - What are you doing to a child?

1938
01:11:02,281 --> 01:11:04,880
- His face looks a bit... - What do you think? Why?

1939
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:06,050
- What's wrong? - What's this?

1940
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:07,150
(This is the worst moment of his 10-year life.)

1941
01:11:07,152 --> 01:11:09,535
- What do you think? - I'm not sure.

1942
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:11,950
- Does this look like you? - I'm not sure.

1943
01:11:11,957 --> 01:11:13,650
(He's not sure.)

1944
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:16,960
- He's not sure. - Why are you so bad today?

1945
01:11:16,962 --> 01:11:18,330
I tried.

1946
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:21,060
Do you like it?

1947
01:11:21,066 --> 01:11:23,360
- Yes. - He likes it.

1948
01:11:23,369 --> 01:11:25,570
Do you really like it?

1949
01:11:25,571 --> 01:11:27,470
- Do you like it? - You can be honest.

1950
01:11:27,473 --> 01:11:29,640
- Do you want to take a picture? - What do you think about this?

1951
01:11:29,642 --> 01:11:30,910
What do you think about this?

1952
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:32,540
- I like it. - Do you?

1953
01:11:32,545 --> 01:11:33,710
- Yes. - Thank you, Hae Joon.

1954
01:11:33,712 --> 01:11:35,380
(Thank you so much.)

1955
01:11:35,381 --> 01:11:39,410
(Seok Jin completes his portrait again in 10 seconds.)

1956
01:11:39,418 --> 01:11:40,650
All right.

1957
01:11:40,653 --> 01:11:41,920
Please stand up.

1958
01:11:41,921 --> 01:11:44,220
(How will it look this time?)

1959
01:11:44,223 --> 01:11:45,390
(Ta-da)

1960
01:11:45,391 --> 01:11:47,150
- Doesn't this look nice? - It does.

1961
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,090
Right? Doesn't this look nice?

1962
01:11:49,094 --> 01:11:50,860
It does. Move your hand for me.

1963
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:52,160
It looks like her, doesn't it?

1964
01:11:52,164 --> 01:11:53,760
(Why is she embarrassed?)

1965
01:11:53,766 --> 01:11:55,300
- Do you like it? - Yes, I do.

1966
01:11:55,301 --> 01:11:56,975
- Do you like it? - Yes.

1967
01:11:57,202 --> 01:11:59,185
Did you hear that? She likes it.

1968
01:11:59,338 --> 01:12:00,800
- Would you like me to sign it? - Yes.

1969
01:12:00,806 --> 01:12:03,870
(They sold 10 pancakes and drew 7 portraits.)

1970
01:12:03,876 --> 01:12:05,770
How many caricatures do we have to draw?

1971
01:12:05,778 --> 01:12:07,825
You're not even pronouncing it right.

1972
01:12:08,547 --> 01:12:10,210
(Meanwhile, Haha escapes So Min's room and enters Je Sung's.)

1973
01:12:10,215 --> 01:12:12,310
- It's right. - This is it.

1974
01:12:12,318 --> 01:12:14,680
He escaped So Min's room. This is Je Sung's room.

1975
01:12:14,687 --> 01:12:16,550
- I'm looking forward to this. - All right.

1976
01:12:16,555 --> 01:12:17,620
- Do we go in? - Yes.

1977
01:12:17,623 --> 01:12:18,850
- Please come in. - Is he facing the wall?

1978
01:12:18,857 --> 01:12:19,950
Hello?

1979
01:12:19,959 --> 01:12:21,520
- Can we come in? - Yes, come in.

1980
01:12:21,527 --> 01:12:22,890
We're coming in.

1981
01:12:22,895 --> 01:12:25,845
- Hello. - You're not ready yet.

1982
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:33,300
(He has to make Haha laugh with a fancy comedy act.)

1983
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:35,100
(There's a chair and just him.)

1984
01:12:35,107 --> 01:12:36,540
- You're not ready yet. - What's this?

1985
01:12:36,542 --> 01:12:38,070
- Can we come in? - Yes, come in.

1986
01:12:38,077 --> 01:12:40,440
- What's this? Is this a bucket? - I thought you'd be busy.

1987
01:12:40,446 --> 01:12:45,580
We saw Haha struggling to escape the rooms,

1988
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:49,520
- so this is a one-star level. - Okay.

1989
01:12:49,521 --> 01:12:52,390
- It's a massage. - That's good.

1990
01:12:52,391 --> 01:12:54,820
The masseur is strict,

1991
01:12:54,827 --> 01:12:56,120
so you can't laugh.

1992
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:59,045
(The masseur is strict, so you can't laugh.)

1993
01:12:59,231 --> 01:13:01,230
You have to be relaxed. You can't frown...

1994
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:02,700
- or smile. - No expression then?

1995
01:13:02,701 --> 01:13:03,930
Your regular facial expression.

1996
01:13:03,936 --> 01:13:05,700
- What is he supposed to do? - Please have a seat.

1997
01:13:05,704 --> 01:13:07,330
- Is he getting a massage? - Yes.

1998
01:13:07,339 --> 01:13:08,570
It's just you.

1999
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:12,025
If it's okay, can you take off your cap?

2000
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:14,680
- He's an expert at scalp massages. - I see.

2001
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,540
- Is there a different masseur? - Yes.

2002
01:13:16,548 --> 01:13:18,610
Is he coming?

2003
01:13:18,617 --> 01:13:21,380
- I'll bring him. - Okay.

2004
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:23,120
- I have to meet the masseur. - Right.

2005
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:24,935
- Let's wait for him. - He's coming.

2006
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:29,520
You should laugh beforehand.

2007
01:13:29,528 --> 01:13:31,345
I think he's fully prepared.

2008
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:33,730
- He can't be that funny, right? - I know.

2009
01:13:33,732 --> 01:13:36,560
- You can hold it in. - I've seen various types of makeup.

2010
01:13:36,568 --> 01:13:38,300
You've seen so many funny things.

2011
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,270
- The masseur is here. - He's here. Let's be quiet.

2012
01:13:40,272 --> 01:13:42,840
- Do I look? - No, you can't look.

2013
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:44,240
Hold on.

2014
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:45,970
- Set... - I didn't look yet, so can I laugh?

2015
01:13:45,978 --> 01:13:47,270
Set, go.

2016
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:48,880
(Haha can't laugh at all. The massage starts now.)

2017
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:51,055
(I won't laugh at all.)

2018
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:56,565
(The masseur approaches him in a solemn atmosphere.)

2019
01:13:57,056 --> 01:14:01,390
(The masseur from an unknown country appears.)

2020
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:06,645
(He can handle it so far.)

2021
01:14:07,966 --> 01:14:09,675
It's the masseur.

2022
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:13,285
I'll relieve...

2023
01:14:13,539 --> 01:14:16,715
your fatigue.

2024
01:14:17,476 --> 01:14:21,795
(Laughter is contagious. The audience is in trouble.)

2025
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:27,825
(He's barely holding it in.)

2026
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:31,620
Do you normally look like that?

2027
01:14:31,623 --> 01:14:33,350
(Let me hold it in a bit more.)

2028
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:35,005
Fatigue,

2029
01:14:35,461 --> 01:14:36,790
come out.

2030
01:14:36,795 --> 01:14:38,290
"Fatigue, come out."

2031
01:14:38,297 --> 01:14:40,730
Fatigue...

2032
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:44,730
(What will come out?)

2033
01:14:44,737 --> 01:14:46,315
Fatigue.

2034
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:49,015
(He turns on his phone.)

2035
01:14:49,074 --> 01:14:51,485
(Please come out.)

2036
01:14:51,577 --> 01:14:52,610
Once.

2037
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:55,380
(These are great lyrics. He laughs once.)

2038
01:14:55,380 --> 01:14:57,455
Once.

2039
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:01,195
Once.

2040
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:02,280
(It's an African song about being lonely.)

2041
01:15:02,287 --> 01:15:08,005
I'll relieve your fatigue.

2042
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:12,245
(Fatigue and laughter, come on out.)

2043
01:15:12,631 --> 01:15:13,890
(He attacks with the music and feet washing.)

2044
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:15,460
This is scary.

2045
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:18,045
There is no escape.

2046
01:15:19,071 --> 01:15:21,140
Your leg hair is very soft.

2047
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,270
All right.

2048
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:25,340
(The second laughter comes out.)

2049
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:26,910
Fatigue.

2050
01:15:26,912 --> 01:15:29,080
(The laughter therapy chases away everyone's fatigue.)

2051
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:31,480
Fatigue, come out.

2052
01:15:31,483 --> 01:15:32,810
(The laughter therapy chases away everyone's fatigue.)

2053
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:34,450
Fatigue, come out.

2054
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:37,480
(This massage is driving me crazy.)

2055
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:39,235
Haha.

2056
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:42,335
I will pluck out your long-standing fatigue.

2057
01:15:43,495 --> 01:15:44,530
What is he doing?

2058
01:15:44,530 --> 01:15:46,145
(The scalp therapy which aims for the 3rd laughter begins.)

2059
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:49,430
(Can you feel your fatigue escaping from the top of your head?)

2060
01:15:49,434 --> 01:15:51,100
My goodness.

2061
01:15:51,103 --> 01:15:53,100
(Fatigue,)

2062
01:15:53,105 --> 01:15:54,640
(come out.)

2063
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,440
(I promise to extract laughter from you.)

2064
01:15:56,441 --> 01:15:57,915
My goodness.

2065
01:16:00,245 --> 01:16:01,610
(Fatigue,)

2066
01:16:01,613 --> 01:16:02,740
(come out.)

2067
01:16:02,748 --> 01:16:04,525
(Laughing)

2068
01:16:05,717 --> 01:16:09,720
(Haha fails to defend himself against the third laughter.)

2069
01:16:09,721 --> 01:16:11,850
This is impossible.

2070
01:16:11,857 --> 01:16:14,520
- You can't win against this. - The long-standing fatigue.

2071
01:16:14,526 --> 01:16:15,820
The long-standing fatigue.

2072
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:17,090
You are out.

2073
01:16:17,095 --> 01:16:18,990
This won't do.

2074
01:16:18,997 --> 01:16:20,930
His touch, voice,

2075
01:16:20,933 --> 01:16:23,330
- and music... - He is so good.

2076
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:25,330
(The penalty is a water slap.)

2077
01:16:25,337 --> 01:16:26,845
Let's begin.

2078
01:16:28,473 --> 01:16:30,470
(Please come out.)

2079
01:16:30,475 --> 01:16:32,255
The song is on repeat.

2080
01:16:34,346 --> 01:16:37,025
1, 2, 3.

2081
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:41,535
(Get a water slap and come out.)

2082
01:16:42,487 --> 01:16:44,735
I will get you a towel.

2083
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:46,990
Congratulations.

2084
01:16:46,992 --> 01:16:48,020
We need to escape.

2085
01:16:48,026 --> 01:16:50,920
Thank you for using our service.

2086
01:16:50,929 --> 01:16:53,745
- Come out of the bathtub. - Come out.

2087
01:16:53,799 --> 01:16:55,775
Come out of the bathtub.

2088
01:16:56,168 --> 01:16:58,830
- The next vacation plan is... - Surfing?

2089
01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:00,570
- Will you surf next? - Surfing.

2090
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:04,040
Where do you want to surf?

2091
01:17:04,042 --> 01:17:05,240
- Me? - Yes.

2092
01:17:05,244 --> 01:17:07,210
With Je Sung, this apartment can be Hawaii.

2093
01:17:07,212 --> 01:17:09,240
(With Je Sung, this apartment can be Hawaii.)

2094
01:17:09,248 --> 01:17:10,880
- What? - He can walk back and forth.

2095
01:17:10,883 --> 01:17:12,980
I can be a local.

2096
01:17:12,985 --> 01:17:13,980
(His looks and clothes scream Hawaii.)

2097
01:17:13,986 --> 01:17:15,020
He can walk back and forth.

2098
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,080
- I can be a local. - He can be a local.

2099
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:19,520
It doesn't matter where I go...

2100
01:17:19,524 --> 01:17:23,290
as long as there are water and a surfboard.

2101
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:25,630
(A true surfer doesn't worry about the location.)

2102
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,690
- The water, surfboard, and wind. - And the sea.

2103
01:17:27,699 --> 01:17:29,260
So I choose the bathtub.

2104
01:17:29,268 --> 01:17:31,060
(Therefore...)

2105
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:33,085
I will surf there.

2106
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:36,940
(A broke surfer chooses to surf in a bathtub.)

2107
01:17:36,942 --> 01:17:38,770
- Let's go. Fill it up. - Let's go.

2108
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:39,940
You have to be cheerful.

2109
01:17:39,945 --> 01:17:42,295
- Of course. - Where will we do it?

2110
01:17:42,514 --> 01:17:45,310
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

2111
01:17:45,317 --> 01:17:47,525
Look at what I have.

2112
01:17:47,953 --> 01:17:50,035
Let's ride this.

2113
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:53,220
(This washboard makes a perfect surfboard.)

2114
01:17:53,225 --> 01:17:55,560
(This is fun.)

2115
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,820
Hold it.

2116
01:17:56,828 --> 01:17:58,360
You look like a surfer.

2117
01:17:58,363 --> 01:17:59,590
(They pretend to be excited in order to complete the mission.)

2118
01:17:59,598 --> 01:18:00,660
My goodness.

2119
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:01,860
Jong Kook, it looks nice.

2120
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:04,670
- There you go. - There you go.

2121
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:06,970
- It works. - It works. It's perfect.

2122
01:18:06,972 --> 01:18:09,115
I will ride it.

2123
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:11,740
It has been a while since I rode a shortboard.

2124
01:18:11,743 --> 01:18:12,870
All right.

2125
01:18:12,878 --> 01:18:13,870
Let's go.

2126
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:15,355
(He goes into the bathtub.)

2127
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:16,910
It's nice.

2128
01:18:16,915 --> 01:18:18,280
(Jong Kook enters the bathtub first.)

2129
01:18:18,283 --> 01:18:21,795
(Can he really surf here?)

2130
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:24,320
- It works. - Waves.

2131
01:18:24,323 --> 01:18:25,890
- It's nice. - Waves.

2132
01:18:25,891 --> 01:18:26,890
(Give me the waves.)

2133
01:18:26,892 --> 01:18:29,535
Waves. Waves.

2134
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:34,630
(The waves are created manually...)

2135
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:37,360
(with a washbowl.)

2136
01:18:37,369 --> 01:18:39,130
It works.

2137
01:18:39,137 --> 01:18:40,900
- This is nice. - I know.

2138
01:18:40,906 --> 01:18:42,140
Take this.

2139
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,470
(This is really fun.)

2140
01:18:44,476 --> 01:18:46,585
Let's go.

2141
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:49,210
(They clear the 4th vacation plan, surfing.)

2142
01:18:49,214 --> 01:18:51,880
I will count that as surfing.

2143
01:18:51,883 --> 01:18:53,995
We have one vacation plan left.

2144
01:18:54,052 --> 01:18:56,265
- The rooftop. - Eating meat at the rooftop.

2145
01:18:56,388 --> 01:18:58,820
It's time to eat meat, but Je Sung has to leave.

2146
01:18:58,824 --> 01:18:59,950
Really?

2147
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,920
Yes. It feels like you planned this.

2148
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:03,390
That's not true.

2149
01:19:03,395 --> 01:19:05,090
- That's not true, Je Sung. - That's not true.

2150
01:19:05,097 --> 01:19:06,160
Give us our 90 cents.

2151
01:19:06,164 --> 01:19:08,260
The leftover 90 cents is your appearance fee. Thank you.

2152
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:09,700
- What? - 90 cents.

2153
01:19:09,701 --> 01:19:11,700
- 90 cents. - Is my appearance fee 90 cents?

2154
01:19:11,703 --> 01:19:12,900
(What? 90 cents?)

2155
01:19:12,904 --> 01:19:14,800
It's less than the minimum wage.

2156
01:19:14,806 --> 01:19:16,140
- 90 cents. - This is all we have.

2157
01:19:16,141 --> 01:19:18,010
- We will pay him on the spot. - 90 cents.

2158
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,170
Please insert it in the unicorn.

2159
01:19:20,178 --> 01:19:21,510
(We wish we could give you 9,000 dollars.)

2160
01:19:21,513 --> 01:19:24,380
I will use it for a good cause.

2161
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:26,710
Okay. Thank you so much for the appearance fee.

2162
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:29,365
- Thank you for your hard work. - I had a lot of fun, Jong Kook.

2163
01:19:29,654 --> 01:19:31,720
At this rate...

2164
01:19:31,723 --> 01:19:32,820
This won't work.

2165
01:19:32,824 --> 01:19:35,260
There is no end in sight. What's the number?

2166
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,720
It's 32.

2167
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:37,720
32 caricatures?

2168
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:40,230
I can't draw anymore because I feel really bad.

2169
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:42,360
I almost made a kid cry.

2170
01:19:42,367 --> 01:19:44,200
There is no end in sight.

2171
01:19:44,202 --> 01:19:45,470
This is driving me crazy.

2172
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:47,370
(Glancing)

2173
01:19:47,372 --> 01:19:50,985
(There is a way to end this.)

2174
01:19:51,276 --> 01:19:53,740
(When they went net fishing for the third part-time job,)

2175
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:57,740
(Jae Seok opened his pouch and checked the hidden mission.)

2176
01:19:57,749 --> 01:20:02,835
(Jae Seok can go home early if he steals Seok Jin's sock.)

2177
01:20:03,155 --> 01:20:05,350
(Help me, Kwang Soo.)

2178
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:08,960
(They agreed on a forehead slap for stealing Seok Jin's sock.)

2179
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,330
(They quickly formed an alliance.)

2180
01:20:13,331 --> 01:20:16,760
(We just need to take one of his socks off.)

2181
01:20:16,768 --> 01:20:19,785
(Is there a way to take them off?)

2182
01:20:20,272 --> 01:20:22,085
There is no end in sight.

2183
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:24,500
Sit down for a second.

2184
01:20:24,509 --> 01:20:27,085
- Why? - I will draw you.

2185
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:29,880
Why would you draw me?

2186
01:20:29,881 --> 01:20:31,480
I feel too bad about drawing someone else.

2187
01:20:31,483 --> 01:20:33,750
- No, no. - What?

2188
01:20:33,752 --> 01:20:35,320
- Sit down for a second. - Why?

2189
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,320
We need to draw as many as we can.

2190
01:20:37,322 --> 01:20:39,250
I feel too bad about drawing someone else.

2191
01:20:39,257 --> 01:20:40,550
A lot of people were upset.

2192
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:42,620
They tried not to show it.

2193
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:43,790
You should be the model.

2194
01:20:43,795 --> 01:20:46,190
- I drew his portrait earlier... - What?

2195
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:48,945
- when you weren't here. - We drew each other.

2196
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:51,030
That's why I need to draw you.

2197
01:20:51,036 --> 01:20:52,900
Even if you draw me, it's just one more.

2198
01:20:52,904 --> 01:20:55,815
We have to do something. We don't have time.

2199
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:58,470
- Let get at least one more done. - No, no.

2200
01:20:58,477 --> 01:21:01,070
When I draw you, tell me that you like my work.

2201
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:03,880
If you draw Seok Jin, I will draw you.

2202
01:21:03,882 --> 01:21:05,365
Really?

2203
01:21:06,084 --> 01:21:07,680
- Okay. - Don't your shoulders hurt?

2204
01:21:07,686 --> 01:21:09,650
(Suddenly)

2205
01:21:09,654 --> 01:21:11,350
- My shoulders don't hurt. - My shoulders hurt a lot.

2206
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:13,305
- Do your shoulders hurt? - Yes.

2207
01:21:13,592 --> 01:21:14,960
My shoulders hurt a lot.

2208
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,290
- Why suddenly? - Why?

2209
01:21:16,294 --> 01:21:19,090
What? It's because of this bag.

2210
01:21:19,097 --> 01:21:21,700
(Seok Jin suddenly talks nonsense about his bag.)

2211
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,330
(When they were drawing caricatures for the part-time job)

2212
01:21:24,336 --> 01:21:25,700
Come here.

2213
01:21:25,704 --> 01:21:28,585
I am really exhausted.

2214
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,170
(No one is here, right?)

2215
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:33,270
I was told to open it when I am exhausted. Today...

2216
01:21:33,278 --> 01:21:35,410
(He takes out his pouch.)

2217
01:21:35,413 --> 01:21:37,710
I don't know when this will end.

2218
01:21:37,716 --> 01:21:38,850
(He was told to open it alone when he was exhausted.)

2219
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,725
The part-time jobs are never-ending.

2220
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:41,980
What is this?

2221
01:21:41,987 --> 01:21:43,535
(What was Seok Jin's mission?)

2222
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:47,050
(Busan to Seoul)

2223
01:21:47,058 --> 01:21:48,290
(Switch bags with Jae Seok.)

2224
01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:52,205
(Seok Jin's mission was switching bags with Jae Seok.)

2225
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,660
(My goodness.)

2226
01:21:53,665 --> 01:21:55,830
This is incredible.

2227
01:21:55,834 --> 01:21:58,800
I should have opened it sooner.

2228
01:21:58,803 --> 01:22:00,730
How will I switch the bags?

2229
01:22:00,739 --> 01:22:02,900
I will take out my wallet in advance.

2230
01:22:02,908 --> 01:22:04,910
Can I switch only the name tags?

2231
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,270
- Yes, you can. - Okay, okay.

2232
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:08,710
I am going to go home.

2233
01:22:08,713 --> 01:22:10,180
This is driving me crazy.

2234
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:11,680
(Will he succeed before Jae Seok does?)

2235
01:22:11,683 --> 01:22:13,480
This bag is...

2236
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:14,480
What is wrong with you?

2237
01:22:14,486 --> 01:22:16,650
- Why would your shoulder hurt? - What?

2238
01:22:16,655 --> 01:22:18,190
You didn't carry it all day long.

2239
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:21,490
We need to finish this quickly and go home.

2240
01:22:21,493 --> 01:22:24,360
Wait a second. What are you doing?

2241
01:22:24,362 --> 01:22:25,960
- What? - Why would you draw me?

2242
01:22:25,964 --> 01:22:26,960
Why?

2243
01:22:26,965 --> 01:22:29,200
It's not so hard to model for a caricature portrait.

2244
01:22:29,201 --> 01:22:31,030
It's strange that you won't do it.

2245
01:22:31,036 --> 01:22:32,670
It's strange that your shoulders suddenly hurt.

2246
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:34,500
- They do hurt. - Let me draw you...

2247
01:22:34,506 --> 01:22:35,940
so that we will be down to 30.

2248
01:22:35,941 --> 01:22:37,300
Sit down. I will draw you.

2249
01:22:37,309 --> 01:22:38,910
That's ridiculous.

2250
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:41,980
They told us to hurry.

2251
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:43,680
(Seok Jin secretly takes off his name tag.)

2252
01:22:43,682 --> 01:22:46,065
- Okay. - Okay. Sit down.

2253
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,165
(Sticking)

2254
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:50,780
(He gets ready to strike with his name tag on his bottom.)

2255
01:22:50,789 --> 01:22:55,320
(He succeeds if he switches name tags with Jae Seok.)

2256
01:22:55,327 --> 01:22:56,690
(Will he make a successful attack?)

2257
01:22:56,695 --> 01:22:58,235
Sit down.

2258
01:22:58,296 --> 01:22:59,890
This isn't the right time.

2259
01:22:59,898 --> 01:23:01,360
(He backs off.)

2260
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:02,860
Let's move.

2261
01:23:02,867 --> 01:23:04,260
- Why? - Let's move.

2262
01:23:04,269 --> 01:23:05,670
Let's move.

2263
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,900
- Why is he acting this way? - I am embarrassed here.

2264
01:23:07,906 --> 01:23:09,100
- Let's move. - What?

2265
01:23:09,107 --> 01:23:10,870
What? Don't come near me.

2266
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:12,770
- What is it? - Do I seem strange?

2267
01:23:12,777 --> 01:23:14,370
- What? - There is nothing strange about me.

2268
01:23:14,379 --> 01:23:17,140
(He is stiff.)

2269
01:23:17,148 --> 01:23:19,565
- You seem really strange. - What is that in your hand?

2270
01:23:20,218 --> 01:23:21,380
What?

2271
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:22,580
- Let's go. - What is that in your hand?

2272
01:23:22,587 --> 01:23:23,980
Nothing. Let's go.

2273
01:23:23,989 --> 01:23:25,790
(He decides to wait for his chance.)

2274
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:26,990
- He is hiding something. - Let's go.

2275
01:23:26,992 --> 01:23:31,205
- There's nothing. - Why do you keep looking this way?

2276
01:23:31,796 --> 01:23:33,560
Let's hurry up and go.

2277
01:23:33,565 --> 01:23:35,530
- Let's move. - Let's move.

2278
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:37,960
- Thank you. Take care. - Thank you.

2279
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,830
- Thank you. - Bye.

2280
01:23:39,838 --> 01:23:41,170
Take care.

2281
01:23:41,172 --> 01:23:42,915
Let's go.

2282
01:23:45,243 --> 01:23:47,510
- Take his shoes off first. - Now?

2283
01:23:47,512 --> 01:23:50,255
(Whispering)

2284
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:54,995
(They discuss when to carry out their plan.)

2285
01:23:55,253 --> 01:23:56,380
Is it this way?

2286
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:57,920
(Seok Jin notices them.)

2287
01:23:57,922 --> 01:24:00,950
(It's a tinderbox.)

2288
01:24:00,959 --> 01:24:02,460
Let's go.

2289
01:24:02,460 --> 01:24:04,135
It's this way.

2290
01:24:04,296 --> 01:24:05,690
(Seok Jin's mission is switching bags with Jae Seok.)

2291
01:24:05,697 --> 01:24:07,705
(Jae Seok's mission is getting Seok Jin's sock.)

2292
01:24:07,899 --> 01:24:11,315
Hello. Be careful. You don't want to get hurt.

2293
01:24:11,836 --> 01:24:13,770
Let's go. Hey.

2294
01:24:13,772 --> 01:24:15,600
Gosh, there are so many people.

2295
01:24:15,607 --> 01:24:17,400
- Let's go. - Hey,

2296
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:19,340
- this is the moment. - Gosh, there are so many people.

2297
01:24:19,344 --> 01:24:21,910
(Hey, this is the moment.)

2298
01:24:21,913 --> 01:24:24,710
(It's time to steal his sock.)

2299
01:24:24,716 --> 01:24:29,695
(I'm going to steal his sock and go home early.)

2300
01:24:29,788 --> 01:24:32,320
(They look for an opportunity...)

2301
01:24:32,324 --> 01:24:34,250
(and grab him.)

2302
01:24:34,259 --> 01:24:35,905
What?

2303
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:38,090
(Kwang Soo subdues him, and Jae Seok steals.)

2304
01:24:38,096 --> 01:24:39,705
What are you doing?

2305
01:24:39,964 --> 01:24:42,915
(What are they doing?)

2306
01:24:43,001 --> 01:24:45,570
(Jae Seok succeeds in taking off his shoe.)

2307
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:47,570
(If I take off his sock,)

2308
01:24:47,572 --> 01:24:51,055
(I can go home.)

2309
01:24:51,209 --> 01:24:53,070
(Slipping off)

2310
01:24:53,078 --> 01:24:54,110
I did it.

2311
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:55,840
(He takes off a sock.)

2312
01:24:55,847 --> 01:24:58,195
(He succeeds in stealing the sock.)

2313
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:01,050
(Seok Jin is in tatters.)

2314
01:25:01,052 --> 01:25:02,320
What is going on?

2315
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:04,420
(Running)

2316
01:25:04,422 --> 01:25:06,005
Come on!

2317
01:25:06,558 --> 01:25:10,275
(Darn it. You little runts.)

2318
01:25:10,362 --> 01:25:11,905
Stop right there!

2319
01:25:13,164 --> 01:25:14,460
He's coming, Jae Seok!

2320
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:17,745
(There's a chase in Busan out of the blue.)

2321
01:25:17,902 --> 01:25:19,270
Follow me.

2322
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:21,430
(We probably lost him now, right?)

2323
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,170
- He's right behind us. - Really?

2324
01:25:25,176 --> 01:25:26,970
(Give back my sock!)

2325
01:25:26,978 --> 01:25:28,455
Hurry up!

2326
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:31,055
(What's gotten into him?)

2327
01:25:31,549 --> 01:25:33,550
(Their part-time jobs began from dawn.)

2328
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:35,980
(Whoever gets left behind here...)

2329
01:25:35,987 --> 01:25:40,135
(must complete the remaining 32 jobs after a long day of work.)

2330
01:25:40,525 --> 01:25:42,220
(It's a matter of getting caught or losing him.)

2331
01:25:42,227 --> 01:25:43,290
Stop right there!

2332
01:25:43,294 --> 01:25:46,630
(The fate of part-time jobs rests upon this chase.)

2333
01:25:46,631 --> 01:25:48,630
(What's the result of this thrilling chase?)

2334
01:25:48,633 --> 01:25:50,245
Here he is!

2335
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:54,600
(He suddenly gets slow. He's out of breath.)

2336
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:56,170
Did he take my sock?

2337
01:25:56,174 --> 01:25:57,370
(Darn it. My sock!)

2338
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:58,710
My sock?

2339
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:00,340
(The sock-thieves make contact with the van.)

2340
01:26:00,345 --> 01:26:02,280
Get in. Hurry. Kwang Soo, hurry.

2341
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,725
- Bye. - Kwang Soo, get in. Let's go.

2342
01:26:05,784 --> 01:26:07,280
- Go, go, go. - Please drive now.

2343
01:26:07,285 --> 01:26:09,235
Hey, you jerks.

2344
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:12,235
(He tries to go after them.)

2345
01:26:12,257 --> 01:26:13,590
Where did they go?

2346
01:26:13,591 --> 01:26:14,590
(Did you really leave without me?)

2347
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:16,105
Where did they go?

2348
01:26:16,161 --> 01:26:17,860
- They left. - They left.

2349
01:26:17,862 --> 01:26:21,460
- Where did they go? - They went that way.

2350
01:26:21,466 --> 01:26:23,530
(Over there. Their van is already out of sight.)

2351
01:26:23,535 --> 01:26:25,630
Getting my sock was his mission.

2352
01:26:25,637 --> 01:26:26,670
(Trudging)

2353
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:30,470
I thought his mission was drawing a picture.

2354
01:26:30,475 --> 01:26:34,170
Those two already set it up. They set this up.

2355
01:26:34,179 --> 01:26:36,880
- Kwang Soo, we did it. - We did it.

2356
01:26:36,881 --> 01:26:38,180
- We did it. - We did it.

2357
01:26:38,183 --> 01:26:40,580
- Thank you. - I really want this to end now.

2358
01:26:40,585 --> 01:26:42,020
This is over. Let's go home now.

2359
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,220
- I want to go home. - Let's go.

2360
01:26:43,221 --> 01:26:45,620
- I want to go home. - Let's go now.

2361
01:26:45,623 --> 01:26:47,635
(It will be over after the last forehead slap.)

2362
01:26:48,059 --> 01:26:50,560
(Kwang Soo owed Jae Seok two forehead slaps.)

2363
01:26:50,562 --> 01:26:54,230
(He was summoned to Busan since dawn.)

2364
01:26:54,232 --> 01:26:57,330
(Why am I doing this? I don't even have to face the penalty.)

2365
01:26:57,335 --> 01:27:01,970
(After helping them so diligently, he finally got his forehead slap.)

2366
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:04,715
- I don't know where my clothes are. - Jae Seok.

2367
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:06,485
Good job today.

2368
01:27:06,878 --> 01:27:09,480
- Let's end it here. Nice and clean. - Okay.

2369
01:27:09,481 --> 01:27:10,780
Yes, unchain me, please.

2370
01:27:10,782 --> 01:27:12,910
- Let's end everything in Busan. - Yes.

2371
01:27:12,917 --> 01:27:15,050
- You're right. - All right. Kwang Soo.

2372
01:27:15,053 --> 01:27:16,420
(Get your forehead ready.)

2373
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:19,390
(This slap has been following him around like a shackle.)

2374
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:20,790
- Let's end it here. - Jae Seok, this is awesome.

2375
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:22,660
- Let's go home now. - Please.

2376
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:23,660
Okay.

2377
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:26,345
(He will settle the long-overdue debt now.)

2378
01:27:26,397 --> 01:27:28,045
(Slapping)

2379
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:30,345
(The sound of his debt settling)

2380
01:27:30,635 --> 01:27:32,570
(The forehead slaps have been settled.)

2381
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:35,315
Let's go. Let's go, Kwang Soo.

2382
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,115
(Let's leave with a light heart.)

2383
01:27:39,544 --> 01:27:41,640
(He must be feeling so happy.)

2384
01:27:41,646 --> 01:27:42,710
We love Busan!

2385
01:27:42,714 --> 01:27:44,810
(He's elated.)

2386
01:27:44,816 --> 01:27:46,450
We'll come back to Busan.

2387
01:27:46,451 --> 01:27:47,950
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2388
01:27:47,952 --> 01:27:49,620
(The sock-thieves leave Busan while feeling carefree.)

2389
01:27:49,621 --> 01:27:51,520
- Let's go. - That was so smart.

2390
01:27:51,523 --> 01:27:53,150
- Thank you, Je Sung. - Thank you.

2391
01:27:53,157 --> 01:27:54,850
- Thank you for the food. - This is so nice.

2392
01:27:54,859 --> 01:27:56,260
This is great.

2393
01:27:56,261 --> 01:27:57,660
- How is it? - It's good.

2394
01:27:57,662 --> 01:27:59,230
Je Sung bought good meat.

2395
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:00,430
(They get to eat thanks to Je Sung.)

2396
01:28:00,431 --> 01:28:03,075
- This is so delicious. - You can get off work now.

2397
01:28:03,301 --> 01:28:04,960
We'll see you next week.

2398
01:28:04,969 --> 01:28:06,630
- We can go home now? - We succeeded.

2399
01:28:06,638 --> 01:28:08,145
- Really? - My gosh.

2400
01:28:09,574 --> 01:28:10,800
(Meanwhile, at Busan Station)

2401
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:12,710
Jae Seok, great job today.

2402
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:14,955
I'll get going.

2403
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,480
Wait.

2404
01:28:16,481 --> 01:28:19,850
(They have Seok Jin's sock.)

2405
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:21,865
Hey, Kwon Ryeol.

2406
01:28:22,153 --> 01:28:25,265
He'll be here soon. When he comes...

2407
01:28:25,523 --> 01:28:27,750
(Right, okay.)

2408
01:28:27,759 --> 01:28:29,235
Hold on.

2409
01:28:34,966 --> 01:28:38,815
(Please have a safe journey.)

2410
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:40,970
(And Seok Jin who's really left behind all alone...)

2411
01:28:40,972 --> 01:28:42,700
- We'll go now. Let's go, Kwang Soo. - Bye.

2412
01:28:42,707 --> 01:28:43,740
Good work today.

2413
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:47,655
(He's trying to fill up 32 all by himself.)

2414
01:28:48,546 --> 01:28:51,225
Goodness, Jae Seok is unbelievable.

2415
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:53,695
He plotted this with Kwang Soo.

2416
01:28:53,851 --> 01:28:56,050
This is so hot. Do you want two?

2417
01:28:56,054 --> 01:28:59,505
- Yes. Thank you. - Two? Okay.

2418
01:29:00,024 --> 01:29:01,705
(Dropping)

2419
01:29:03,595 --> 01:29:05,260
This won't count.

2420
01:29:05,263 --> 01:29:08,430
- What should I do? - Please don't count this one.

2421
01:29:08,433 --> 01:29:09,945
It's hot.

2422
01:29:10,068 --> 01:29:13,530
I'll dock this one from my pay.

2423
01:29:13,538 --> 01:29:14,700
Darn it.

2424
01:29:14,706 --> 01:29:17,800
This 3-dollar tanghulu is now 2 dollars.

2425
01:29:17,809 --> 01:29:20,340
Here. Thank you. Here you go.

2426
01:29:20,345 --> 01:29:21,910
- Me too. - Thank you.

2427
01:29:21,913 --> 01:29:25,525
All right. Three tanghulus.

2428
01:29:25,783 --> 01:29:28,325
Do you want 5? 2? Here's the last 1.

2429
01:29:28,353 --> 01:29:31,680
- Congratulations on filling 100. - Yes!

2430
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:34,220
Thank you, everyone.

2431
01:29:34,225 --> 01:29:35,660
(Next week)

2432
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,960
(Special guests visit Running Man.)

2433
01:29:37,962 --> 01:29:40,245
(Lee Ha Na, an actress who swept TV screens)

2434
01:29:41,299 --> 01:29:43,930
(Im Soo Hyang, unexpected charms)

2435
01:29:43,935 --> 01:29:47,630
(A new character you've never seen on variety shows has come.)

2436
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:50,470
(These scary ladies are ready to join the variety shows.)

2437
01:29:50,475 --> 01:29:53,070
(They don't need time to adjust.)

2438
01:29:53,077 --> 01:29:55,240
(It's their journey to dominate variety shows.)

2439
01:29:55,246 --> 01:29:57,510
(However,)

2440
01:29:57,515 --> 01:30:01,095
(a mysterious bank shows up in front of them.)

2441
01:30:01,552 --> 01:30:05,335
(And strange things begin to take place.)

2442
01:30:05,423 --> 01:30:09,420
(These suspicious ladies are behind everything.)

2443
01:30:09,427 --> 01:30:12,590
(A mysterious chase begins all of a sudden. What's the result?)

2444
01:30:12,597 --> 01:30:15,175
(Don't Trust Her)
