1
00:00:06,647 --> 00:00:10,216
(Bleak atmosphere surrounds a party room in Incheon.)

2
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:17,226
(There are jack-o'-lanterns and various Halloween decorations.)

3
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:20,856
(Despite the bleak atmosphere, there is upbeat music at the party.)

4
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:22,856
Don't dance like that. It's scary.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,926
Stop it.

6
00:00:25,296 --> 00:00:28,537
(I bet you haven't seen costumes like these in a while.)

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,636
(His movements are on a different level.)

8
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:35,836
(Everyone enters under the hip clown's lead.)

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,406
(Frankenstein's Monster is having fun.)

10
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:39,507
(Giggling)

11
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:42,617
That's scary. That's scary.

12
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:44,817
Seok Jin, why didn't you wear makeup?

13
00:00:44,817 --> 00:00:46,317
I am wearing a lot of makeup. It took an hour and a half.

14
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:48,317
- Really? - I am wearing a lot of makeup.

15
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:49,357
I got more wrinkles.

16
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:50,387
Isn't that how you normally look?

17
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:52,957
(Hong Kong Grandma looks younger than the usual.)

18
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:55,296
What's your costume?

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,726
- "It's the end." - Park Joong Heon.

20
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:57,766
- "Goblin." - "Goblin."

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,537
You need to watch dramas.

22
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:02,937
- "You..." - "You..."

23
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:07,836
(Park Joong Heon has a silver tongue that scares a goblin.)

24
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,547
Se Chan looks cool today.

25
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:13,246
People told me that I am handsome when my face is covered.

26
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:15,416
- Se Chan is handsome. - The costume brings out his face.

27
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,617
I see that I have to cover everything up.

28
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:19,957
I didn't know that Kwang Soo's shoulders were so broad.

29
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,086
(Broad shoulders)

30
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,957
(It should be one-meter-wide at least.)

31
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:27,927
The best part of your costume is your back hair.

32
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,326
- It's not a part of my costume! - Is it your hair?

33
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:31,196
- Yes. - You grew out your hair for this.

34
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:32,427
No, I didn't.

35
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:33,436
- It wasn't for this. - It looks good.

36
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:35,297
The costume wouldn't have worked without the back hair.

37
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:39,336
(Frankenstein's Monster has back hair instead of screws.)

38
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:44,047
(Mummy looks handsome thanks to the costume.)

39
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,246
I don't know her costume is.

40
00:01:46,246 --> 00:01:47,416
Corpse Bride.

41
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:48,517
- It's well-known. - I haven't watched it.

42
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,847
It's from an animated movie, "Corpse Bride."

43
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,317
An animated movie? Gosh, you have big eyes.

44
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:53,856
You look like you got Botox under your eyes.

45
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:56,086
- You became younger. - You became younger.

46
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:57,927
People tell me that I look younger...

47
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,127
- because my wrinkles are gone. - You look younger.

48
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:00,657
That must be why people get Botox under their eyes.

49
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,356
I want this costume.

50
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:07,196
(Corpse Bride can swear until people turn blue.)

51
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,697
(She looks really pretty.)

52
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,707
(Jealous)

53
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:13,607
So Min's outfit suits her.

54
00:02:13,936 --> 00:02:15,336
- So Min. - She became prettier.

55
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:16,746
You look prettier than the usual.

56
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:18,647
- Is this a good look on me? - You look prettier.

57
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:20,577
You really look pretty.

58
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:23,716
Jong Kook, are you a dog or Wolverine?

59
00:02:23,716 --> 00:02:25,816
- I think he is a dog. - He is a mutant.

60
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,716
- He is a mutant. - I am a werewolf.

61
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,727
He dressed better than he usually does.

62
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:31,827
- You know, - It's like a stage costume.

63
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,596
this is better than what I usually wear.

64
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,596
- You look good. - You look fashionable.

65
00:02:35,596 --> 00:02:37,566
His hair looks cool.

66
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,197
You shouldn't have tried to look cool.

67
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:41,297
I didn't try!

68
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:43,237
You look like a muscular fool.

69
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,066
- Really? - Your outfit looks cool.

70
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,306
Haha is the one with the best costume.

71
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:48,607
Haha.

72
00:02:48,607 --> 00:02:49,876
(He is on a different level.)

73
00:02:49,876 --> 00:02:53,107
Why wasn't I notified ahead of time? This is a penalty.

74
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:56,216
He put a lot of effort...

75
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:58,216
- into this one episode. - Here is what I think.

76
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:00,686
If you make a comeback as RGP like this, it will be a hit.

77
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,887
- That's right. - It's a nice costume.

78
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:05,827
You will be NORAZO's rival.

79
00:03:05,827 --> 00:03:07,197
If she and I team up,

80
00:03:07,197 --> 00:03:08,327
(Do you know this?)

81
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:09,427
you will get the Big Mac set.

82
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:12,197
You are right. You are right.

83
00:03:12,197 --> 00:03:13,197
Let's unite!

84
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:14,436
(So Min's costume and Haha's face make a McDonald's character.)

85
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,936
- You are right. - You are right.

86
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,036
Don't eat Burger King today.

87
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:21,237
- My goodness. - You will be the talk of the town.

88
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,336
I am Ronald McDonald.

89
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:23,677
Is this product placement?

90
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:24,707
Yes.

91
00:03:25,107 --> 00:03:29,077
(Werewolf bites if you touch him.)

92
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,947
(Chucky is a mix of a tiger moth and a crazy woman.)

93
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:33,957
(Clown isn't a product placement for McDonald's.)

94
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:37,327
This is a Halloween party.

95
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:40,626
To be honest, Jae Seok and Seok Jin belong in a comedy skit.

96
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,927
The rest of us...

97
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:43,966
- belong in Itaewon. - We are dressed for Halloween.

98
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:45,397
- Hey. - Hey.

99
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:48,496
Make sure you go.

100
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,536
Make sure you go in that state.

101
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:53,237
People will take pictures of me.

102
00:03:53,237 --> 00:03:55,936
This costume is stylish. I suddenly feel confident.

103
00:03:55,936 --> 00:04:00,216
For the Halloween party, you will be joined...

104
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:01,947
by the three guests.

105
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:03,517
- Really? - We have guests today.

106
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,017
- We are in this state. - Did they dress up as well?

107
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,316
- You will know when you see them. - They must have dressed up.

108
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:10,126
I will be angry if they haven't dressed up like us.

109
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:12,586
- They had better not be pretty. - Seriously.

110
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,626
I will be angry.

111
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,566
- What? - "Sugar"?

112
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:19,626
"Sugar."

113
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:21,667
- My goodness. - What is that?

114
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,136
Hello.

115
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,167
(He looks fresh.)

116
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:28,407
(Ahn Hyo Seop, Dracula, has looks that make hearts flutter.)

117
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:34,316
(Ahn Hyo Seop is a popular actor who captivated older women.)

118
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:38,816
(He visits Running Man with the burning enthusiasm alone.)

119
00:04:40,816 --> 00:04:42,157
Hello.

120
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,186
- What? - Hello.

121
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:44,927
You didn't wear any makeup!

122
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,857
- I did wear a lot of makeup. - What is this?

123
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:49,756
He is handsome! He is handsome!

124
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,597
- What is this? - Why didn't he wear makeup?

125
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:53,436
Oh, you wore a lot of makeup.

126
00:04:53,436 --> 00:04:55,597
Why didn't Hyo Seop wear any makeup?

127
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,766
Putting wax on hair doesn't count.

128
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,566
I want a costume like that!

129
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,576
- Hyo Seop. - You didn't wear makeup.

130
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,876
What is this?

131
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:05,076
This is my first time to be rude to a guest.

132
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,076
- You can't tell, but he is Haha. - Go and get your makeup done.

133
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,677
- Get your makeup done. - Hyo Seop.

134
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:10,886
You didn't wear eyeshadow like Dracula,

135
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:13,146
- but an idol singer. - It's not like that.

136
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,157
It wasn't my intention.

137
00:05:15,157 --> 00:05:17,826
He has the desire to look good.

138
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:20,027
You have more desire to look good.

139
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:21,857
He is handsome.

140
00:05:21,857 --> 00:05:24,227
- He is handsome. - I am in your care.

141
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,027
(Good-looking New Face Ghost)

142
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:28,797
- Who is next? - Here comes the second guest.

143
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:29,837
(The second guest)

144
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:32,167
- I will be angry. - Seriously.

145
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:33,806
The guests should wear makeup.

146
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,206
(Let's see if this guest is wearing proper makeup.)

147
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:36,547
- "Havana." - Who is that?

148
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:37,706
It's the virgin ghost.

149
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:39,777
(Dancing)

150
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:42,277
- Hold on. - This virgin ghost is sexy.

151
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:45,047
- She can dance well. - She can dance well.

152
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:46,217
Who is she?

153
00:05:46,217 --> 00:05:49,456
(Who could she be?)

154
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,927
- What? - She can dance well.

155
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:54,927
It's Na Eun! Na Eun!

156
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:59,196
(Na Eun, Virgin Ghost, makes men's hearts flutter.)

157
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:02,967
(It's Na Eun!)

158
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,936
- It's Na Eun. - Why didn't you wear makeup?

159
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,037
- It's Na Eun. - Let go of me.

160
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,777
Na Eun didn't wear makeup.

161
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,506
Why didn't you wear much makeup?

162
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,446
- She looks pretty. - She is the virgin ghost.

163
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:14,376
Our costumes are excessive!

164
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,816
- This is ridiculous. - Gosh, this is embarrassing.

165
00:06:16,816 --> 00:06:19,587
- The guests look pretty. - Put blood on her face at least!

166
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,217
She still would have looked pretty with blood on her face.

167
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:24,427
- Our costumes are too much! - The guests look pretty.

168
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,487
- Why did we dress up? - This is ridiculous.

169
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,227
That's the proper way of dressing up for Halloween.

170
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:32,326
- Look at us. - I won't stand still.

171
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:33,867
- Jae Seok. - What?

172
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,436
You look exactly like your mother.

173
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:40,037
I became so startled for a second. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

174
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,837
I will put an end to this.

175
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,107
Jae Seok looks like a woman...

176
00:06:43,107 --> 00:06:45,246
- with makeup. - That's right.

177
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,576
Really?

178
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:47,717
Why are you happy about it?

179
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:50,587
- He has a middle-aged woman's face. - For goodness' sake.

180
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,217
I am so annoyed.

181
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:54,417
- The last guest had better be good. - Seriously.

182
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,287
If the last guest is fresh-faced, we won't stand still.

183
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:58,487
We will go home.

184
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:01,157
Who is that?

185
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,826
(With a broom,)

186
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:08,496
(the last guest appears.)

187
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,636
- My goodness. - Come on!

188
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:11,436
What is that?

189
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,206
She didn't wear makeup.

190
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,636
(Seo Young Hee, Witch, is a rare guest at a variety show.)

191
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:17,206
(It's impossible to gauge how dangerous she is.)

192
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:22,946
(Seo Young Hee is an actress with 1,000 faces.)

193
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:27,316
(She is genius who pulls off both comedy and horror.)

194
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:29,417
She didn't wear makeup.

195
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,686
- Hello. - I refuse to work today.

196
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:35,326
- This is too much. - Seriously.

197
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:36,967
- This is hilarious. - She is so pretty.

198
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,126
Her face is practically bare.

199
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,537
The guests are here, but everyone is angry.

200
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:43,136
I am happy to see you. I am sorry.

201
00:07:43,136 --> 00:07:44,837
- I am sorry, we just... - I am just too angry.

202
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,777
We are happy to see you,

203
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:49,777
but we thought the guests would wear heavy makeup...

204
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,547
to celebrate Halloween.

205
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:52,876
That's the proper way of dressing up for Halloween.

206
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:56,117
We have three guests today.

207
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,686
Let's start with Seo Young Hee.

208
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:02,357
Hello. Hello.

209
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,126
- Young Hee is an actress... - I am a big fan.

210
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:06,386
- who played a ghost many times. - That's right.

211
00:08:06,427 --> 00:08:08,326
- A ghost. - She played a villain many times.

212
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:09,927
She played a character who kills old ladies in an island.

213
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,797
- That's right. - That's right.

214
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:14,737
This is the first time Young Hee is joining us on Running Man.

215
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,737
Yes, this is my first time here.

216
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:20,037
As for this kind of variety show where we stand and move around,

217
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:21,936
I've been only on "Love Letter."

218
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:23,347
- "Love Letter"? - "Love Letter"?

219
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:24,576
- That's ages ago. - She was on "Love Letter"?

220
00:08:24,646 --> 00:08:27,016
- She was on "Love Letter"? - You were on "Love Letter"?

221
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:32,487
(During the 2000s, "Love Letter" was popular among young adults.)

222
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:35,756
(Back then, Jong Min and Young Hee were a popular couple.)

223
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,687
(She's a master at variety shows. Or is she not?)

224
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,926
- She's quite old. - She starred on it with Young Eun,

225
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,296
- Chun Myung Hoon, and Jong Min. - That's right.

226
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:44,097
My goodness, no way.

227
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:46,636
Is this your first variety show after "Love Letter"?

228
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:47,697
- Yes, it is. - What?

229
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,036
This kind of system is all new to me.

230
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:53,136
- Hyo Seop, why did you laugh? - I was told to laugh a lot.

231
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:56,376
(My agency told me to laugh a lot.)

232
00:08:57,176 --> 00:08:59,276
Even so, how can he laugh at nothing?

233
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,977
- That laugh was unnatural. - I'm sorry.

234
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:04,386
- He has a handsome smile. - Exactly.

235
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:06,786
It's been a while since I saw someone taller than Kwang Soo.

236
00:09:06,786 --> 00:09:08,487
- Seriously. - How tall are you? I'm curious.

237
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:10,557
I'm 187cm tall.

238
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:12,957
- Kwang Soo is taller. - Right.

239
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:14,827
- But your body proportion... - Why does he not look taller?

240
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,396
- What do you mean? - It's the body proportion.

241
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,026
- Why don't I look taller? - Something is completely different.

242
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,496
It's the makeup.

243
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,067
I always tell you this.

244
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,437
If you want to be tall, you should have his physique.

245
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,607
No, it's the makeup.

246
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,766
I understand why it'd seem so. It has to be the makeup.

247
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,437
By the way, Kwang Soo is...

248
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:29,077
- very tall among comedians. - That's right.

249
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:31,146
- You haven't paid your club dues. - You're in a comedian association.

250
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,217
- Why would I pay the club dues? - You're behind a lot of dues.

251
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:34,416
No, I'm not in it.

252
00:09:34,676 --> 00:09:35,876
Pay up your dues.

253
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,617
- Visit the meeting room too. - Yes, come visit us.

254
00:09:37,617 --> 00:09:38,947
Whenever we put on makeup,

255
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,357
they put a lot of paint in front of me.

256
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:43,256
Last time, it was blue. And green, today. They use a lot of paint.

257
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,786
You're frustrating. This just shows...

258
00:09:44,886 --> 00:09:46,087
you have two jobs now.

259
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:47,827
- Your main career is the comedian. - That's right.

260
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:49,967
- You're acting on the side too. - Exactly.

261
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,166
We won't stop you from acting.

262
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,636
- However, pay your dues. - Why would I?

263
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:57,337
My goodness, he's so weird.

264
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:58,837
He won't pay the dues.

265
00:09:58,837 --> 00:09:59,977
Let's interview Hyo Seop.

266
00:09:59,977 --> 00:10:03,246
You mentioned earlier. Did your agency give you tips?

267
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,246
- He's sweating a lot. - He must be nervous.

268
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:07,447
- His costume is thick too. - He's just nervous.

269
00:10:07,447 --> 00:10:08,717
Let me wipe that for you.

270
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,087
(Talking kindly)

271
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,217
- Thank you. - Let me wipe that for you.

272
00:10:12,217 --> 00:10:14,916
(What are you doing?)

273
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,786
Please get a close-up of this.

274
00:10:17,156 --> 00:10:19,526
You should wipe your drool instead.

275
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:22,727
You should just wipe off your booger.

276
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:23,896
People have been badmouthing me a lot.

277
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,727
Okay, let me wipe this.

278
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,496
- Wipe your snout instead. - Did your agency give you any tips?

279
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,166
- Wipe your snout instead. - Did your agency give you any tips?

280
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,307
Like the one you said earlier. They told you to laugh a lot.

281
00:10:31,307 --> 00:10:32,437
(Did his agency give him any special advice?)

282
00:10:32,437 --> 00:10:33,536
They just...

283
00:10:34,307 --> 00:10:35,876
- told me to sweat less. - Okay.

284
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:37,847
- You sweat a lot. - Yes, I do sweat a lot by nature.

285
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,006
Here's my observation.

286
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,577
- Because he's nervous, - That's right.

287
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,717
- he's exploding with sweat. - I see.

288
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,447
- When you're new to the industry... - He's sweating more and more.

289
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,957
or when you star on variety shows, usually...

290
00:10:48,957 --> 00:10:49,957
Why are you laughing?

291
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,656
(He laughs as soon as he looks at Haha.)

292
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,026
You look so funny.

293
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:55,727
Unbelievable.

294
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:57,666
- Hey, sorry to interrupt. - Look at the mirror.

295
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:00,567
Here's my advice. Don't talk about serious stuff today.

296
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,097
Usually...

297
00:11:02,097 --> 00:11:03,837
(He suddenly speaks in a high-pitched voice.)

298
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:05,536
(Do you want me to lose all my seriousness?)

299
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:07,607
People predict what will happen on the show.

300
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,737
Don't discuss serious stuff.

301
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,876
(His costume is pushing him to the edge.)

302
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,276
Don't mention serious topics.

303
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,516
- Gosh, the CG was amazing. - Seriously.

304
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:17,746
Tell us about today's race.

305
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:20,817
Today's race is Dangerous Invitation for the Halloween party...

306
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,626
that will unite ghosts from the East and West.

307
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:24,857
"Dangerous Invitation."

308
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:27,896
Among 11 guests who are invited to the party,

309
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,626
there are real ghosts who have grudges...

310
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:31,896
against the humankind and have penetrated...

311
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:33,636
to turn humans into ghosts.

312
00:11:33,636 --> 00:11:35,567
- I saw this coming today. - My goodness.

313
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,906
- Who is it? - How did you know?

314
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,036
- Who is it? - How did you know that?

315
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:39,337
(Striding)

316
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:41,337
It's not me.

317
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:42,837
What are you doing? It's not me.

318
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:45,307
- It's you, isn't it? - I'm just Frankenstein's Monster.

319
00:11:45,546 --> 00:11:47,676
- I'm just Frankenstein's Monster. - Isn't it you?

320
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:49,016
Wait, it's not me.

321
00:11:49,016 --> 00:11:50,347
Whenever there's a spy...

322
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,286
We have to suspect him first.

323
00:11:52,487 --> 00:11:54,756
All right. After going through three missions,

324
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,727
winning members will receive a hint about the ghost.

325
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:00,827
If humans work together and get rid of all the ghosts,

326
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:01,896
Team Humans will win.

327
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:04,426
However, if the ghosts eliminate all of the humans,

328
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:05,867
Team Humans will lose.

329
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,097
Goodness, I must catch those ghosts today.

330
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,506
All right. After you change into your team's uniform,

331
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:14,136
- you'll start the first mission. - We dressed up for this?

332
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:15,577
We'll remove our makeup now?

333
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,347
- Hold on. We'll remove the makeup? - We're going to remove it now?

334
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:18,506
- Hey. - Already?

335
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:19,776
Let's keep the makeup to the end.

336
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:21,447
- It took me two hours to do this. - Are you kidding me?

337
00:12:21,447 --> 00:12:22,617
- Are you joking right now? - Hold on.

338
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:23,987
I thought we were going to keep it the whole day.

339
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:25,847
- This is it? - It's over?

340
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:27,156
- The first game... - What is this?

341
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,286
(They set out for the first mission.)

342
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:31,426
It took longer to put on and remove the makeup...

343
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,987
than to film with the makeup on.

344
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,526
(They finish washing their faces.)

345
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,426
I can't believe we wasted that makeup.

346
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,766
(The members are brought to the next place for the party.)

347
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:41,396
Kwang Soo, now that you're not wearing that makeup,

348
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:42,666
I think you looked better before.

349
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:45,607
- You had an excuse before at least. - No, no.

350
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:48,307
I didn't completely remove the makeup.

351
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,536
I left a bit of makeup.

352
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:50,807
(I didn't completely remove the green paint.)

353
00:12:51,276 --> 00:12:53,246
So Min, did you put on the Egg Ghost's makeup?

354
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,347
- She looks cute. - I removed all of my makeup.

355
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:59,487
The 1st clue about the ghosts is at stake on the 1st mission.

356
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:01,317
It's Dancing with the Ghosts.

357
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:02,717
(Dancing with the Ghosts)

358
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,426
- Hey, let's get the hint. - Great.

359
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:05,426
- We must catch the ghosts. - Let's get them.

360
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:07,327
I'm sure there is only one ghost,

361
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:08,526
but the ghost must have a helper.

362
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:09,967
- There's a helper. - Of course.

363
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:11,367
It can't be just one.

364
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,126
- It has to be more than 2. - I think it's one of you.

365
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,837
- Then are there 3 ghosts? Or 4? - What?

366
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,266
(Hyo Seop makes a mysterious remark.)

367
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,406
- Are there 4? - There are 3 ghosts?

368
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:19,977
- How do you know there are three? - How do you know that?

369
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:21,376
- Who told you that? - What's going on?

370
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:23,307
- I don't know how many there are. - Are you sure?

371
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:24,807
You didn't tell us how many yet?

372
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:27,347
- He started to sweat now. - He's sweating.

373
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,516
- This is it. - No.

374
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,916
- You're sweating again. - No, I'm just...

375
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:32,786
Let me retract what I said.

376
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:34,187
Fine. I'll pretend I didn't hear you.

377
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:35,687
They said there were three ghosts?

378
00:13:35,687 --> 00:13:37,057
I don't remember hearing such a thing.

379
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:38,487
Is he acting or what?

380
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:39,756
(Is Hyo Seop the ghost among us?)

381
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:42,796
You'll form Team A and Team B with five people in each team.

382
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:44,996
For 100 seconds, you'll pass on the dance moves in a relay.

383
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,166
If the last member on the line correctly guesses...

384
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,136
the title and singer, it's a success.

385
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:50,967
If you answer more than 8 songs, you'll get 3 hints.

386
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:52,406
If you answer more than 5, you'll get 2 hints.

387
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:53,807
If you answer more than 3, you'll get 1 hint.

388
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:55,937
Team A is already formed with five members.

389
00:13:56,276 --> 00:13:57,347
- How? - Is that so?

390
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,807
From me to So Min, it makes a team of five.

391
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,646
(Jae Seok, three guests, and So Min make up a team.)

392
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:01,817
- Come on, Jae Seok. - You'll form Team B.

393
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:03,077
- Why? - You took all the good ones.

394
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,587
- What? I just have Na Eun. - We're doomed then.

395
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:05,746
I want to play with the guest too.

396
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,087
- I want to play with the guest. - Why do you mean?

397
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:08,256
I want to play with the guest too.

398
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:09,416
Play what?

399
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,057
- You're unbelievable. - They can be on the same team.

400
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:13,926
- My goodness. - Why don't the female guests pick?

401
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,496
- They are the female guests. - Why don't you two choose members?

402
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:16,896
- You should each pick a member. - Okay.

403
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:17,996
They can play rock-paper-scissors.

404
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:19,796
Is there another game than rock-paper-scissors?

405
00:14:19,996 --> 00:14:21,597
- Stop it! - That's enough!

406
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,266
(Don't even bring up about the Race of Wits.)

407
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,536
- That game isn't suitable here. - Hasn't it...

408
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,376
- been a while since we played? - Stop it.

409
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:29,337
I hate having to observe other people's wits.

410
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:31,776
- It's been long since we played. - It's only been a week.

411
00:14:31,776 --> 00:14:32,906
My goodness.

412
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,977
Does anyone have the blood type B?

413
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:37,217
- Blood type B? - Should we use our blood types?

414
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:38,786
- I like that idea. - I have blood type B.

415
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,016
- Blood type B. - Blood type B.

416
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:43,256
- It's Na Eun. Okay. - Blood type B. Okay.

417
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,987
- Okay. - Great. This is great.

418
00:14:45,286 --> 00:14:47,126
(Na Eun has blood type B?)

419
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:48,396
(Mine is blood type B too.)

420
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,067
- Stop lying. - I know you don't have it.

421
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,426
Why would you lie about your blood?

422
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:53,067
- I don't know mine. - Don't lie about your blood.

423
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:54,766
Hey, you don't have blood type B.

424
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:56,737
Hey, this isn't good. That's not a good way to form teams.

425
00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:58,237
Is any of you Leo?

426
00:14:58,237 --> 00:14:59,406
- Me! - Me!

427
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:01,006
(Haha is full of ideas. He suggests using zodiac signs.)

428
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:02,937
- You're a Leo? - What about Sheep?

429
00:15:02,937 --> 00:15:04,046
- I'm Sheep. - I'm Deer.

430
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:05,246
My sign is Mat!

431
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:06,717
(What?)

432
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:09,717
- Me. - You're Mat?

433
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,347
I'm Grave Site.

434
00:15:11,347 --> 00:15:12,786
(This is a fun pun game.)

435
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,117
Grave Site? You're a Grave Site?

436
00:15:14,286 --> 00:15:15,717
- Grave Site? - You're a Grave Site?

437
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,687
(Jee Seok Jin, Hong Kong Grandma, and Grave Site)

438
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:19,357
Grave Site. Seok Jin is a Grave Site.

439
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:21,597
All right, everyone. Let's be fair.

440
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:23,227
Okay. How about this?

441
00:15:23,396 --> 00:15:26,067
- You'll play rock-paper-scissors. - Come on!

442
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,136
- Hey, we said that earlier. - We should've done that earlier!

443
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:30,136
- You're just wasting time. - Look how many minutes passed.

444
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:32,707
We ought to think and brainstorm.

445
00:15:32,707 --> 00:15:34,176
I will accept your opinions...

446
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,437
and follow them.

447
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:36,876
You two should play rock-paper-scissors.

448
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,376
- We'll choose our members? - Yes.

449
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:39,406
You two will pick.

450
00:15:39,676 --> 00:15:41,077
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

451
00:15:41,516 --> 00:15:42,617
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

452
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,646
(Na Eun wins.)

453
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:45,687
Na Eun won.

454
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:47,317
Na Eun has an upper hand at this mission.

455
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:49,286
- That's right. - I want to be in Na Eun's team.

456
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,987
We have to dance, right?

457
00:15:50,987 --> 00:15:52,057
- That's right. - She has an advantage.

458
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,526
(Silently pleading)

459
00:15:53,526 --> 00:15:54,557
What should I do?

460
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,727
(Pick me.)

461
00:15:56,727 --> 00:15:57,996
(Gazing)

462
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,026
(She turns away when their eyes meet.)

463
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:01,766
You have completely wiped out memories of Se Chan.

464
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,766
(Is he that bad?)

465
00:16:03,766 --> 00:16:05,536
- Na Eun, look over here too. - She forgot about me.

466
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:07,207
- She completely forgot about him. - Wait.

467
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:12,006
(You were shy when I nicknamed you Beautiful Deer.)

468
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:15,447
(And you said that you wanted to become a close friend.)

469
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:17,187
- She didn't even look at him. - Hey, Jae Seok.

470
00:16:17,187 --> 00:16:18,246
She never once looked at me.

471
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:22,117
For a while, Se Chan couldn't forget about Na Eun.

472
00:16:22,117 --> 00:16:23,426
Na Eun, choose one member.

473
00:16:23,827 --> 00:16:25,386
It's just a team game for a day.

474
00:16:25,386 --> 00:16:27,026
- Don't let that pressure you. - That's right.

475
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,057
- It's just for one game. - Me?

476
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:30,396
Okay.

477
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,467
(He tries to force his way into Team Na Eun.)

478
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,967
- What? She didn't pick anyone yet. - She just picked me.

479
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:36,237
- She just chose me. - Jae Seok.

480
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,506
She looked at me.

481
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:38,506
She looked at me.

482
00:16:38,506 --> 00:16:39,707
- Seriously? - Really?

483
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:42,077
- You chose So Min? - She wants to stand out.

484
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:44,207
(Vicious slandering)

485
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,807
(He slanders Na Eun out of jealousy.)

486
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:46,977
- My goodness. - Hey.

487
00:16:46,977 --> 00:16:48,546
- You're so mean. - This is unbelievable.

488
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:49,717
Na Eun, you're so mean.

489
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,886
- That's not true. - You guys are cruel.

490
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,087
- You're so mean. - You're so mean.

491
00:16:53,087 --> 00:16:54,416
Na Eun just gave me goosebumps.

492
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,457
We haven't seen her for a while. She changed a lot.

493
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,886
- She's so cruel. - How cruel.

494
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:00,697
- That's not true. - The Queen of Leggings.

495
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:02,357
Young Hee will choose next.

496
00:17:03,126 --> 00:17:04,827
Me? All right.

497
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,636
She wants to stand out.

498
00:17:06,636 --> 00:17:08,136
Seriously. She wants to look pretty.

499
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,537
I won't wait for long.

500
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:10,636
(He's bluffing.)

501
00:17:10,636 --> 00:17:11,767
- Haha. - That's it.

502
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:12,936
- My goodness. - This is the best combination.

503
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,206
(Na Eun chose Haha.)

504
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:16,436
- I'll choose Hyo Seop. - Hyo Seop.

505
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,047
Team Good-looking!

506
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:20,077
Let's go! Let's go!

507
00:17:20,146 --> 00:17:21,716
If you don't pick Se Chan, you'll look mean.

508
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:23,446
Se Chan.

509
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,117
Okay!

510
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:26,287
You're trying to look nice.

511
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:27,416
(She turns down his handshake.)

512
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,557
Good job.

513
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,027
(That's... That's all right.)

514
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,757
(Team A: Na Eun, So Min, Haha, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and Se Chan)

515
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:34,456
(Team B: Young Hee, Hyo Seop, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, and Jae Seok)

516
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:36,057
Which team will go first?

517
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,626
- Should we go 1st? - Yes, let's go 1st.

518
00:17:37,626 --> 00:17:39,896
- We have six people in our team. - Okay. Let's watch carefully.

519
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:42,896
As we watch them play, we have to single out the ghosts.

520
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:46,107
- The ghosts will look obvious. - Don't mess up in the middle.

521
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,706
(Someone among them might be a ghost, sabotaging the mission.)

522
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:50,247
(They play songs unrelated to the mission.)

523
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:51,307
Great.

524
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:52,706
(Na Eun will present, and Se Chan will answer.)

525
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:53,777
I like the song.

526
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,077
Tell you what.

527
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:56,716
Even if he's listening to recent songs,

528
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:58,386
the way he dances is different...

529
00:17:58,386 --> 00:17:59,646
compared to the old people.

530
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:03,057
(Unlike young members who are dancing trendy moves...)

531
00:18:03,057 --> 00:18:04,456
Seok Jin is doing the traditional mask dance.

532
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:06,226
(This guy from the old times is engrossed with an old dance move.)

533
00:18:06,226 --> 00:18:07,257
Get ready.

534
00:18:07,527 --> 00:18:09,357
- Start. - We should observe.

535
00:18:10,726 --> 00:18:11,997
She's starting now.

536
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,367
(Okay, I got this.)

537
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,837
(So Min, you know these moves, right?)

538
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,136
(Na Eun puts her hands on her face...)

539
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:22,406
(and gestures shooting a gun. What song is this?)

540
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:26,446
("Gashina" by SUNMI, 2017)

541
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,986
(Na Eun perfectly copied the key moves.)

542
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,587
(I know this one.)

543
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,216
It's so easy.

544
00:18:34,216 --> 00:18:35,716
They'll definitely get it right.

545
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:38,257
(So Min's moves are perfect too.)

546
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,557
They can definitely get it right.

547
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:41,997
(Good job, So Min.)

548
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:44,696
- If they get it wrong... - They would be the ghosts.

549
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:46,696
(Only ghosts don't know what song this is.)

550
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:49,736
(Oh, I know this one.)

551
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:56,007
(Jong Kook, look at this. I'm scratching my face.)

552
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:59,706
(The attractive move turns into having itchy cheeks.)

553
00:19:00,577 --> 00:19:01,976
That's wrong.

554
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:04,216
(It looks weird, but I think I got it.)

555
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,216
Okay.

556
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,686
Many of them are good dancers.

557
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,956
(Jong Kook managed to understand Seok Jin's moves.)

558
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:13,396
(Se Chan doesn't seem to be sure.)

559
00:19:13,396 --> 00:19:16,027
(You don't know this song?)

560
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,097
Let me answer.

561
00:19:18,297 --> 00:19:19,666
"Gashina" by SUNMI.

562
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,037
Okay!

563
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,997
(Correct)

564
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:25,966
(Let's continue this way!)

565
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:27,837
- Come on! - What was this?

566
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,507
He did it a bit wrong.

567
00:19:31,176 --> 00:19:34,047
You should have done this instead.

568
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,317
(Is Seok Jin just old or is he a ghost?)

569
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,347
(They move onto the next question.)

570
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:39,587
(Okay, I got this.)

571
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:42,057
(She moves her arms vigorously.)

572
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:45,426
(What is that?)

573
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:50,297
(You don't know what song it is?)

574
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,027
("Fire" by BTS, 2016)

575
00:19:52,027 --> 00:19:55,236
(Na Eun perfectly copied the moves from the intro.)

576
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,236
(You're supposed to move arms like that?)

577
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:00,007
(I got it.)

578
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,436
(So Min got it perfectly.)

579
00:20:03,176 --> 00:20:04,777
(It's so easy.)

580
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:08,617
(Haha pulls it off 200 percent.)

581
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:10,117
- That's perfect. - It's impossible to get it wrong.

582
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,317
- You have to get it wrong. - It's so easy.

583
00:20:11,986 --> 00:20:13,656
(I know this one.)

584
00:20:14,456 --> 00:20:15,817
(What?)

585
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:19,686
(An old man's mask dance)

586
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:21,956
He's a ghost.

587
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,267
- Isn't it too obvious? - He's 100 percent a ghost.

588
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,027
I'm sure.

589
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:29,936
(He seems to be hoping the mission would fail.)

590
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:31,037
You know this one, right?

591
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,406
(It's not sure if Seok Jin is a ghost or just a bad dancer.)

592
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:38,206
(Jong Kook copies Seok Jin's moves without understanding them.)

593
00:20:38,206 --> 00:20:42,216
(Will Se Chan be able to say the correct answer?)

594
00:20:42,216 --> 00:20:43,716
"Fire" by BTS.

595
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:46,817
(It's the correct answer.)

596
00:20:46,817 --> 00:20:47,857
He's so good.

597
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:48,857
Okay!

598
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,357
(Jong Kook and Se Chan's amazing teamwork)

599
00:20:50,357 --> 00:20:51,587
Wasn't that good enough?

600
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:53,797
Don't go overboard.

601
00:20:53,797 --> 00:20:54,997
Seok Jin is a ghost.

602
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,166
(Seok Jin is suspicious again. Is he really a ghost?)

603
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:00,267
(There are only 40 seconds left now.)

604
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,097
(I can do these moves perfectly.)

605
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,807
(Confused)

606
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:05,807
Oh, that one.

607
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:07,777
(It's my song. "Mr. Chu" by Apink.)

608
00:21:08,406 --> 00:21:09,876
("Mr. Chu" by Apink, 2014)

609
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:13,847
(These are Apink's most famous dance moves.)

610
00:21:14,376 --> 00:21:16,986
(Na Eun repeats the dance moves.)

611
00:21:17,646 --> 00:21:18,986
(What is that?)

612
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,257
Oh, that one.

613
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:22,287
(Let me just try.)

614
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,156
Seok Jin is good at this one.

615
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:25,686
(Na Eun did this.)

616
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:27,857
(She moved her arms like this...)

617
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:29,527
(and did this with her fingers.)

618
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:32,327
(You have to kiss, not poke.)

619
00:21:32,997 --> 00:21:34,196
(Na Eun...)

620
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:36,166
(made a V sign.)

621
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:37,607
(Haha is not sure.)

622
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,867
It's too difficult. What should I do?

623
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,607
(Haha points at Na Eun.)

624
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,837
(A square face?)

625
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:45,676
(What's that?)

626
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:50,317
(Seok Jin starts dancing a little irritated.)

627
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:53,787
(Square face)

628
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:56,017
- Park Nam Jung. - Park Nam Jung.

629
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,956
(The cute kissing gesture...)

630
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:01,997
(turned into the alphabet dance.)

631
00:22:03,267 --> 00:22:04,997
(I'm a bit confused.)

632
00:22:05,896 --> 00:22:07,936
(It's something like this.)

633
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:09,166
That's wrong.

634
00:22:09,436 --> 00:22:10,636
That's not the right move.

635
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,666
"With My Dad."

636
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,037
It's "Mr. Chu."

637
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,307
(There are only 20 seconds left.)

638
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,547
The ghosts must be in action now.

639
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:23,117
(She shoots a gun and does a body wave.)

640
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:24,587
- I got it. - What is it?

641
00:22:24,587 --> 00:22:25,886
"Ddu-du Ddu-du."

642
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,186
(It's obviously "Ddu-du Ddu-du.")

643
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:29,257
("Ddu-du Ddu-du" by BLACKPINK, 2018)

644
00:22:29,257 --> 00:22:33,926
(These gun-shooting moves became a hit last summer.)

645
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:36,297
(So Min gets it right away.)

646
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:37,367
Okay.

647
00:22:38,126 --> 00:22:39,396
(But...)

648
00:22:39,396 --> 00:22:41,497
(her moves look a little different.)

649
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:45,966
(I have no idea.)

650
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,607
(That's not quite right.)

651
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,706
(Ddu-du ddu-du)

652
00:22:50,706 --> 00:22:53,176
(Like this?)

653
00:22:53,176 --> 00:22:54,716
(It's too hard for a bad dancer like Seok Jin.)

654
00:22:54,716 --> 00:22:56,446
I'm not sure. It's too hard.

655
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:58,087
- You know what it is? - No.

656
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,587
(I'm sorry. I don't know what it is.)

657
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,416
It's too hard.

658
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:02,686
(How is the suspect going to dance?)

659
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:03,886
He's a ghost.

660
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:08,396
(He definitely acts like a ghost again.)

661
00:23:08,396 --> 00:23:10,926
He's a ghost. I'm 100 percent sure.

662
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,966
What's that?

663
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:15,696
(They got 2 questions right in 100 seconds.)

664
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:17,807
- Isn't it "Ddu-du Ddu-du"? - Yes.

665
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:21,476
- Who did it wrong? - You should have done this.

666
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:23,446
You should have done this. Who did it wrong?

667
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:25,107
So Min is a little suspicious.

668
00:23:25,107 --> 00:23:26,247
She...

669
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:29,216
- Is she a ghost? - I can't dance to new songs.

670
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:30,287
(She gives an excuse.)

671
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:35,416
(But So Min is known to be good at dancing to new songs.)

672
00:23:35,686 --> 00:23:37,626
She says she can't dance to new songs.

673
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:38,827
I don't know the moves.

674
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:39,926
She's acting a little strangely.

675
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:41,396
I just copied Na Eun.

676
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:43,527
Na Eun must have known the moves,

677
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:44,966
but she did them a little wrong.

678
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:49,666
(It's impossible for Na Eun not to know the moves.)

679
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:53,577
(It's strange that she seemed unsure and did the moves a bit wrong.)

680
00:23:53,577 --> 00:23:56,406
- How did Na Eun do it? - She didn't make it clear.

681
00:23:56,406 --> 00:23:58,107
- Look at that. - You should have done this.

682
00:23:58,107 --> 00:24:00,347
Her dance is a bit pretentious.

683
00:24:00,347 --> 00:24:01,916
(Criticizing)

684
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,287
- She's a little pretentious. - She's pretentious.

685
00:24:04,287 --> 00:24:06,017
- She's pretentious. - When she dances,

686
00:24:06,017 --> 00:24:09,416
she doesn't do this. She's like this instead.

687
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,656
She is a good dancer, but she's a little pretentious.

688
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:13,087
- You're right. - Seriously?

689
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,027
Just because she failed once?

690
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:16,767
So Min started it.

691
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:17,966
Is that why?

692
00:24:17,966 --> 00:24:19,166
(Is Na Eun just pretentious or is she a ghost?)

693
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:20,537
Should I say the answer?

694
00:24:20,537 --> 00:24:22,567
You should do something because you know many songs.

695
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:25,136
Well... Na Eun is the most suspicious.

696
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,636
Na Eun, try it. Do you want to be the last person?

697
00:24:26,636 --> 00:24:29,436
So Min and Seok Jin are seriously suspicious.

698
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:30,676
Seok Jin is definitely a ghost.

699
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:31,946
I just didn't know the moves.

700
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,416
Okay. Seok Jin, come here.

701
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:35,176
- He either didn't know or... - He's too suspicious.

702
00:24:35,176 --> 00:24:36,446
I seriously didn't know.

703
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:39,386
But remember, Seok Jin loves attention.

704
00:24:40,057 --> 00:24:41,587
I realized it last week.

705
00:24:42,186 --> 00:24:43,327
He loves close-ups.

706
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:46,186
Young Hee, you can do this!

707
00:24:46,186 --> 00:24:49,557
- You can do this! - I'm a terrible dancer.

708
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,327
We have to get many right to win a hint.

709
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:53,027
If you just copy the moves,

710
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,396
we can get it right.

711
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:56,067
- I'll do my best. - You can do this!

712
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:57,567
All right.

713
00:24:58,867 --> 00:25:00,607
Ready.

714
00:25:00,936 --> 00:25:02,037
Hyo Seop.

715
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,946
Hyo Seop.

716
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:05,807
(He is facing the first player.)

717
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,017
Please turn around.

718
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:09,817
(Variety shows are so hard.)

719
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:11,547
He's cute.

720
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:13,087
Ready.

721
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:16,386
(They're given 100 seconds. They start from the first question.)

722
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:21,827
(What is this?)

723
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:22,857
What should I do?

724
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,666
I don't remember anything.

725
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,636
(She forgets everything when she turns around.)

726
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:29,867
(She tries to memorize the moves again.)

727
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:30,867
What should I do?

728
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:35,337
(Clumsy)

729
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,247
That's Ppak Gu.

730
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:38,376
(It brings back memories.)

731
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,317
- "Gag Concert." - That's Ppak Gu.

732
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:43,386
What should I do?

733
00:25:43,386 --> 00:25:45,146
(Young Hee shows the Ppak Gu dance to Hyo Seop.)

734
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:46,317
What is this?

735
00:25:46,317 --> 00:25:48,057
(Young Hee shows the Ppak Gu dance to Hyo Seop.)

736
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:50,257
(He copies the dance perfectly.)

737
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,686
(This is what Young Hee did.)

738
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:53,257
What's this?

739
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:56,257
- That's Ppak Gu. - That's Ppak Gu.

740
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:58,396
(The handsome Ppak Gu)

741
00:25:58,396 --> 00:26:01,867
What is it? Is it taekkyeon﻿?

742
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,767
(Ji Hyo becomes confused.)

743
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:07,376
(She is infected by the Ppak Gu virus too.)

744
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,307
(Am I doing it right?)

745
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:11,107
What should we do with those three?

746
00:26:11,577 --> 00:26:12,876
- What's that? - What should I do?

747
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,416
That's just a fool.

748
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:15,517
(The Ppak Gu brother and sisters)

749
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,317
What is this?

750
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:18,716
(This is how it should look.)

751
00:26:19,247 --> 00:26:21,916
("Fantastic Baby" by BigBang, 2012)

752
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,087
(The key moves make you look somehow like Ppak Gu.)

753
00:26:25,087 --> 00:26:26,126
What is this?

754
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:27,726
They're in trouble.

755
00:26:27,926 --> 00:26:29,797
(Seok Jin turns the moves into...)

756
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,327
(the "Swallowtail" dance.)

757
00:26:32,327 --> 00:26:33,337
Like this.

758
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:35,797
(Kwang Soo takes it seriously.)

759
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:39,507
What is this? Hey!

760
00:26:40,236 --> 00:26:42,476
(Flapping)

761
00:26:43,176 --> 00:26:44,347
Are you kidding me?

762
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,077
What is this?

763
00:26:46,077 --> 00:26:47,577
(That's not quite right.)

764
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:49,347
- What is this? - What should we do?

765
00:26:49,946 --> 00:26:51,446
"Idol" by BTS?

766
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:52,646
(Wrong)

767
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:53,716
What is this?

768
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:56,456
Young Hee can't possibly be this bad at dancing.

769
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,156
- She even saw the video clip. - Let's see what it was.

770
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,857
(They start to suspect Young Hee.)

771
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:02,896
("Dance in the Rhythm" by Kim Wan Sun)

772
00:27:02,896 --> 00:27:04,196
- What should I do? - Hurry up.

773
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,097
(Young Hee is in trouble.)

774
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:10,936
(The first question made the members suspect Young Hee.)

775
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:13,736
(Will she able to clear up that suspicion?)

776
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,936
What's that?

777
00:27:16,376 --> 00:27:18,406
(She seems to know the moves.)

778
00:27:18,876 --> 00:27:22,247
(But she makes them look completely different.)

779
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:24,386
Young Hee is a terrible dancer. What's that?

780
00:27:24,646 --> 00:27:25,886
(Is she a bad dancer or a ghost?)

781
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:27,017
What's that?

782
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:29,156
- What's that? - 1, 2, 3, 4.

783
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:31,626
(Hyo Seop copies Young Hee's moves again.)

784
00:27:31,886 --> 00:27:33,757
He's a bad dancer, but he's cute.

785
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,027
(He is handsome and bad at dancing.)

786
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:37,867
(What is this?)

787
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:42,097
(Ji Hyo is infected by the bad dancer virus.)

788
00:27:42,097 --> 00:27:43,807
(I have no idea.)

789
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,906
What should we do with those three?

790
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,837
- They're suspicious. - What's that?

791
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:50,206
You three should all go to a club together.

792
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:53,176
(It's Seok Jin to turn to show the moves to Kwang Soo.)

793
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:56,317
(He does the "Swallowtail" dance again.)

794
00:27:56,317 --> 00:27:58,446
- We're suddenly at a marketplace. - I don't know what this is.

795
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,057
What is that?

796
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:01,857
- Isn't that "Macarena"? - That's "Macarena."

797
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:03,456
- Isn't that "Macarena"? - What's that?

798
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,626
(Isn't that "Macarena" from 1992?)

799
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,027
What's that?

800
00:28:07,497 --> 00:28:09,497
(It went from Kim Wan Sun to "Swallowtail" to "Macarena.)

801
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:11,327
- It's "Macarena." - It's "Macarena."

802
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,926
Isn't it "Macarena"?

803
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:14,297
"Macarena"?

804
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:15,597
(Jae Seok's answer "Macarena" is incorrect.)

805
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,706
- Isn't it "Macarena"? - What are you doing?

806
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:20,077
- Wait a minute. - You have 15 seconds left.

807
00:28:20,136 --> 00:28:21,777
Hurry, we don't have time.

808
00:28:21,777 --> 00:28:23,577
She's terrible at dancing. We're in trouble.

809
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,847
(I know this for certain.)

810
00:28:24,847 --> 00:28:26,206
- She got it. - We're in trouble.

811
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,277
Here it is.

812
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:29,376
- I know what it is. - I know this.

813
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,486
Did you see it?

814
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,757
("Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND)

815
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:36,587
(Young Hee does this dance well.)

816
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:37,827
I know this for certain.

817
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:39,757
Do exactly what she did.

818
00:28:41,456 --> 00:28:43,027
That's not it.

819
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:44,666
(Moving about)

820
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,666
- Oh, no. - Hyo Seop is in trouble.

821
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,767
Take a look.

822
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,067
(Hyo Seop's dance is too weak.)

823
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:52,367
- Hurry up. - I know what it is.

824
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:56,277
That's right.

825
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,676
(It goes back to the correct moves of "Bboom Bboom.")

826
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,946
- She's got it. - Is that it?

827
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,617
(Is that it? Okay.)

828
00:29:01,946 --> 00:29:04,186
- I bet Seok Jin will do his dance. - Right.

829
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:05,416
Seok Jin will do it.

830
00:29:05,547 --> 00:29:07,757
("Bboom Bboom"?)

831
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,617
(But it turns into...)

832
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:10,956
(It turns into his left and right movement.)

833
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:13,257
- Right? - You were right.

834
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:15,196
There he goes again.

835
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:18,827
- Goodness. He always does it. - There he goes again.

836
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:21,097
He moves like a ghost, right?

837
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:23,267
- What's this? - What is it?

838
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:25,037
Take a look.

839
00:29:25,037 --> 00:29:26,607
(Apparently, this is it.)

840
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:27,906
It's "Bboom Bboom."

841
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:29,807
It's "Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND.

842
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:32,976
(Surprisingly Jae Seok answers correctly.)

843
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:34,916
- Did he get it right? - It's "Bboom Bboom."

844
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:36,686
He answered it.

845
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:39,017
- He was right. - He was correct.

846
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:41,757
(The dance turns back into "Bboom Bboom" miraculously.)

847
00:29:41,757 --> 00:29:42,757
- What was the first one? - That's surprising.

848
00:29:42,757 --> 00:29:44,656
The first one was "Fantastic Baby."

849
00:29:44,656 --> 00:29:46,327
- "Fantastic Baby"? - That was it?

850
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:48,156
- This is what to do. - How did you do it, Young Hee?

851
00:29:48,156 --> 00:29:49,557
How could you not know?

852
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:50,867
- She danced like Ppak Gu. - What was it?

853
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:53,867
What's certain is that there are five ghosts.

854
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:57,367
Hyo Seop could dance a little,

855
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,837
but he made no effort.

856
00:29:58,837 --> 00:30:00,777
I can't dance.

857
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:03,136
(He scratches his head.)

858
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:05,176
What? Is that your acting voice?

859
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:06,847
While scratching his head,

860
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:09,617
he says, "Gosh, I can't dance at all."

861
00:30:09,617 --> 00:30:13,117
(While scratching his head, he says, "I can't dance at all.")

862
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,416
(Is that some kind of drama?)

863
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:19,156
I've never seen anyone scratch his head outside of dramas.

864
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:21,656
- It was like acting. - That's because I'm nervous.

865
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:24,926
Let's have 6 of us play 1 more time.

866
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,936
It should be six suspicious people.

867
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:29,666
Let's find who they are. Pick those who aren't good.

868
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:30,767
(They pick six candidates for being a ghost.)

869
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:33,037
Get ready, set...

870
00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:34,037
(So Min, Na Eun, Young Hee, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and Haha)

871
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:37,146
("Growl" by EXO)

872
00:30:37,146 --> 00:30:38,876
(She copies the dance perfectly.)

873
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,317
This is it. It's obvious.

874
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,886
This is it.

875
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,216
It's EXO.

876
00:30:45,216 --> 00:30:49,557
(I know, it's EXO.)

877
00:30:49,587 --> 00:30:51,626
(But he doesn't know the song title?)

878
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:53,557
- Hey, come on. - Don't you know it?

879
00:30:53,597 --> 00:30:56,097
Haha, you're a ghost.

880
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,497
There's no way.

881
00:30:57,497 --> 00:30:59,626
- It's EXO's what? - You can't remember it?

882
00:31:00,037 --> 00:31:01,537
They dance in school uniform.

883
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:02,767
- Haha. - "Growl."

884
00:31:02,767 --> 00:31:03,767
("Growl" is correct.)

885
00:31:03,767 --> 00:31:04,837
- Okay. - He almost missed it.

886
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:05,867
That's right.

887
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:08,706
- It's definitely Haha. - He was buying time.

888
00:31:08,706 --> 00:31:09,706
He's suspicious.

889
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,777
("Gee" by Girls' Generation is famous for its dance.)

890
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:13,277
- It's easy. - That's right.

891
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:16,047
- Na Eun is good. - That's it.

892
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,986
That's all you need to do.

893
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:20,057
(Next is Seok Jin's turn.)

894
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,587
(Knock, knock, is anyone home?)

895
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:22,916
How do I do it?

896
00:31:23,186 --> 00:31:24,757
What's wrong with him?

897
00:31:25,057 --> 00:31:27,357
- He's knocking. - Why is he knocking?

898
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:30,767
(The ghost continues to knock.)

899
00:31:31,426 --> 00:31:33,736
- It's "Gee" by Girls' Generation. - Yes.

900
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,466
(Haha answers correctly despite Seok Jin's knocking.)

901
00:31:35,466 --> 00:31:36,567
It's confusing.

902
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:37,767
Isn't he strange?

903
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,867
He's definitely a ghost.

904
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:43,676
Everyone should know that.

905
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:45,876
- Everyone must know. - Everyone should know it.

906
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:47,047
- Right? - I know.

907
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:48,216
Okay.

908
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:49,446
(Both Young Hee and Jae Seok succeed.)

909
00:31:49,886 --> 00:31:50,986
I know.

910
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:51,986
(He's very confident.)

911
00:31:54,857 --> 00:31:56,557
(Hey, Haha.)

912
00:31:56,557 --> 00:31:59,827
(Wait a minute.)

913
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,196
He's very suspicious.

914
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:03,367
(He kicks Seok Jin.)

915
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,426
(Go away, you ghost.)

916
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,297
(Seok Jin is a ghost who's stuck awkwardly.)

917
00:32:08,297 --> 00:32:09,906
"Dim Memories of You" by Hyun Jin Young.

918
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,666
- Okay. - He got it correct.

919
00:32:12,037 --> 00:32:13,406
(I'm sorry for kicking you.)

920
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:14,406
Okay.

921
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:17,206
You answered a total of six questions.

922
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:19,446
You get two hints.

923
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:21,716
- That's a lot. - Someone from the last group,

924
00:32:21,716 --> 00:32:22,716
please come out.

925
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:23,946
(I'll go.)

926
00:32:24,446 --> 00:32:25,446
Is it just one person?

927
00:32:25,547 --> 00:32:27,057
The last group?

928
00:32:27,057 --> 00:32:28,857
- This goes to the last group. - We're the last group.

929
00:32:28,857 --> 00:32:31,456
They decide whether to share it or not.

930
00:32:31,456 --> 00:32:32,886
- Why? - No.

931
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:34,656
- Jae Seok. - Let us see it.

932
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:37,196
- Wait, those who are suspicious... - We're on the same team.

933
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:39,426
- Jae Seok. - We're the last group.

934
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,337
We helped the last group.

935
00:32:41,337 --> 00:32:42,497
I said that we're the last group.

936
00:32:42,497 --> 00:32:44,436
We helped the last group.

937
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,466
I said that we're the last group.

938
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,976
We picked you.

939
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,777
Joseph, block him.

940
00:32:48,777 --> 00:32:50,876
(He should learn a lesson.)

941
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:52,446
We should look at it together.

942
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:53,876
Who are you calling Joseph?

943
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:56,146
Joseph is someone from the Bible.

944
00:32:56,146 --> 00:32:57,416
He's Hyo Seop.

945
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,946
Who's Joseph?

946
00:32:58,946 --> 00:33:00,757
- Wait a minute. - Wait.

947
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:02,557
(Jae Seok touches his chest.)

948
00:33:02,557 --> 00:33:04,186
What are you doing?

949
00:33:04,486 --> 00:33:06,057
Why did you touch me?

950
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:07,857
(He's very volatile.)

951
00:33:07,857 --> 00:33:09,656
- I was just... - Why did you touch me?

952
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,067
- I can't share the hint. - Apologize to me now.

953
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:14,067
- Apologize to his chest. - Hurry.

954
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,196
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

955
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,436
That's cute. He's cute.

956
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:20,976
Hey, kiss right here.

957
00:33:21,236 --> 00:33:22,876
- I'm sorry. - Apologize.

958
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,946
Okay.

959
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:27,047
(He apologizes directly to his chest.)

960
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,146
(Jong Kook is satisfied.)

961
00:33:29,247 --> 00:33:31,486
- It didn't hurt your pride, did it? - No.

962
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:34,117
It's better to apologize to his chest.

963
00:33:34,117 --> 00:33:35,686
You seemed cute too.

964
00:33:35,686 --> 00:33:36,757
It didn't hurt my pride.

965
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:39,257
If you did something wrong, it's good to apologize.

966
00:33:39,287 --> 00:33:40,956
Let's not do that.

967
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:42,357
We don't know who the ghost is.

968
00:33:42,357 --> 00:33:44,297
Right, and the hint would be very vague.

969
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:45,867
- It's a woman. - The first...

970
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,337
- What did it say? - It's a woman.

971
00:33:47,337 --> 00:33:48,466
It means that it's a man.

972
00:33:48,466 --> 00:33:50,706
- There's a younger female ghost. - Yes, the first is a female ghost.

973
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:51,706
It's you.

974
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:55,077
(One of these four is a ghost.)

975
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,577
- It's Jae Seok. - That's not it.

976
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:02,077
One of the three ghosts is a man.

977
00:34:02,077 --> 00:34:03,486
- Are there three ghosts? - No.

978
00:34:03,486 --> 00:34:04,886
Three ghosts?

979
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:06,557
We got him.

980
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:09,256
It's over. Seok Jin is one of them.

981
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,687
Are there three ghosts?

982
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:11,856
- It's over for Seok Jin. - Three ghosts?

983
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:13,457
- They're Hyo Seop... - It's over.

984
00:34:13,457 --> 00:34:15,397
- and Seok Jin. - It's over.

985
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,167
- They're Hyo Seop and Seok Jin. - It's definitely him.

986
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:18,566
It's obvious.

987
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:21,066
- He's denying it. - He said it.

988
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:22,397
Stop it.

989
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,406
- Look at him. - Let us think.

990
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:26,506
(They've found another hint in their suspicion.)

991
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,807
"The ghosts are 2 men and 1 woman."

992
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:31,707
"2 men and 1 woman."

993
00:34:31,707 --> 00:34:33,577
Three ghosts is correct.

994
00:34:33,577 --> 00:34:34,676
(There are 3 ghosts.)

995
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:36,787
- Joseph said it a moment ago. - They're here.

996
00:34:36,787 --> 00:34:39,046
- Joseph said it. - No way.

997
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:40,656
- No, he didn't. - He's Hyo Seop, not Joseph.

998
00:34:40,656 --> 00:34:42,557
- Hyo Seop? - Seok Jin is...

999
00:34:42,557 --> 00:34:44,827
- more like a grandfather. - I know.

1000
00:34:44,827 --> 00:34:46,827
That's why it's a hint.

1001
00:34:46,827 --> 00:34:48,827
- Is that why? - If he's called a grandfather...

1002
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:50,597
- It's to confuse us. - Right.

1003
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:52,127
2 men and 1 woman.

1004
00:34:52,127 --> 00:34:54,037
We've found out the two of them.

1005
00:34:54,037 --> 00:34:55,597
(Is either Seok Jin or Hyo Seop a ghost?)

1006
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,437
- I'm hungry. - Abalone galbitang sounds good.

1007
00:34:58,437 --> 00:35:02,136
Next mission is a chance to win lunch and additional hints.

1008
00:35:02,307 --> 00:35:04,307
It's called Your Name has Three Syllables.

1009
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:06,446
(Your Name has Three Syllables)

1010
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,377
Divide into a group of two.

1011
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:10,517
Listen to the first syllable.

1012
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:12,446
You and your partner answer one after the other.

1013
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,986
Complete the three-syllable word.

1014
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:18,656
In six dishes prepared for today's lunch,

1015
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,227
a sentence about ghosts is distributed.

1016
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:24,066
- We have to put them together. - We do.

1017
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,026
This won't be easy.

1018
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:28,336
- There are many twists. - Okay, everybody.

1019
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,506
- I'm uncomfortable. - Why?

1020
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:32,106
A ghost is sitting next to the person next to me.

1021
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:33,877
- What? - It's Seok Jin.

1022
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:35,236
- Don't be fooled again. - Seriously.

1023
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:38,347
I'm never it in the end. It's the same today.

1024
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,247
- Everyone. - Goodness.

1025
00:35:41,247 --> 00:35:44,917
Four female members will pick male members.

1026
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:47,117
(Picking one's partner determines their success.)

1027
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:48,356
Okay, I got it.

1028
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:50,557
- Ji Hyo, pick your partner first. - Yes?

1029
00:35:50,557 --> 00:35:51,957
- Do I go first? - Pick one.

1030
00:35:52,127 --> 00:35:54,296
Ji Hyo has to eat no matter what.

1031
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:55,756
She has to win.

1032
00:35:56,397 --> 00:35:57,627
Is she looking at you?

1033
00:35:57,727 --> 00:35:58,966
Won't she pick Haha?

1034
00:35:58,966 --> 00:36:00,966
Don't I exist? She doesn't look at me.

1035
00:36:00,966 --> 00:36:03,066
You aren't human, so I won't look at you.

1036
00:36:03,066 --> 00:36:04,506
- He's a ghost. - You're a ghost.

1037
00:36:04,506 --> 00:36:06,136
- My goodness. - You aren't human.

1038
00:36:06,136 --> 00:36:07,676
I'm not a ghost.

1039
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:11,046
I know which member Ji Hyo won't choose.

1040
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,077
Kwang Soo is out.

1041
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:14,676
- Jae Seok. - Kwang Soo is out.

1042
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:15,946
- What about you? - I'm out too.

1043
00:36:15,946 --> 00:36:17,086
Jae Seok and Se Chan are out.

1044
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:19,046
- Seok Jin is out. - I have potential.

1045
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,816
Are you over with Haha?

1046
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:23,957
- Are you over with Haha? - She needs to find someone new.

1047
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:25,026
(She might need to find a new business partner.)

1048
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,356
- She just glared at him. - She's a ghost.

1049
00:36:27,356 --> 00:36:28,897
She's a ghost.

1050
00:36:29,196 --> 00:36:31,696
- She's ghost indeed. - She's the original ghost.

1051
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:33,026
She's from "Whispering Corridors."

1052
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,836
(Do you want me to make it scary?)

1053
00:36:34,836 --> 00:36:36,196
It's from that movie.

1054
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,406
You aren't over with Haha.

1055
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:39,867
It isn't over yet.

1056
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:43,077
- It's Ji Hyo and Haha. - Okay.

1057
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:46,676
Please tell me today. What makes me attractive?

1058
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,577
- Everything about you. - Goodness.

1059
00:36:48,577 --> 00:36:50,386
Tell him today.

1060
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:51,816
I want to play with someone else.

1061
00:36:51,816 --> 00:36:52,847
I pick...

1062
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:54,687
someone easy.

1063
00:36:54,687 --> 00:36:56,287
- Seok Jin? - Yes.

1064
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,957
(What?)

1065
00:36:57,957 --> 00:36:59,656
Is that easy?

1066
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:01,327
(Wouldn't a ghost pick another ghost?)

1067
00:37:01,327 --> 00:37:03,227
- They're both ghosts. - I bet he's good.

1068
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,566
I'm great.

1069
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,196
I'm also Young Hee's fan.

1070
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,037
Didn't she watch him play all day?

1071
00:37:08,037 --> 00:37:09,667
- How can she think he'd be good? - Seriously.

1072
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,167
Wait, are they ghosts?

1073
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,276
(Are Seok Jin and Young Hee a team of ghosts?)

1074
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,377
What about Na Eun?

1075
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:15,877
(Na Eun is another candidate for a ghost.)

1076
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:17,847
Na Eun could be a ghost.

1077
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:19,946
I don't think she is. She played well.

1078
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:20,946
(It's okay even if you're a ghost.)

1079
00:37:20,946 --> 00:37:23,247
- I don't think she's a ghost. - She played well.

1080
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:25,247
(She approaches slowly.)

1081
00:37:25,247 --> 00:37:27,957
(She comes towards me.)

1082
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:32,256
(Please, please)

1083
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:35,926
(Tell me that it's Se Chan.)

1084
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:38,127
- I pick Jae Seok. - Me?

1085
00:37:38,127 --> 00:37:39,127
(I'm sorry, Se Chan.)

1086
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,136
- Okay. - Me?

1087
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:44,367
Why did you look at the staff and the director?

1088
00:37:44,367 --> 00:37:45,966
Why did you do that?

1089
00:37:45,966 --> 00:37:47,307
- I didn't. - Why did you look at the director?

1090
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:50,577
Na Eun could have picked Se Chan.

1091
00:37:50,577 --> 00:37:52,307
She works hard.

1092
00:37:52,307 --> 00:37:54,046
- I was uncomfortable. - Why?

1093
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:56,886
Na Eun picked me when I'm sitting next to Se Chan.

1094
00:37:56,886 --> 00:37:58,586
- I was uncomfortable. - It's okay.

1095
00:37:58,586 --> 00:38:00,316
(I'll wait until the day when we become closer.)

1096
00:38:00,316 --> 00:38:01,457
It's too difficult.

1097
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:02,656
Whom should I pick?

1098
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,426
I don't know either. Pick Jong Kook.

1099
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:06,727
- Just pick Hyo Seop. - Pick Hyo Seop.

1100
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:08,926
Isn't it your first time picking a male guest?

1101
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:10,526
- By the way, - Pick Hyo Seop.

1102
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:12,497
if Hyo Seop doesn't get chosen...

1103
00:38:12,867 --> 00:38:13,966
So Min.

1104
00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:15,836
Why are you blushing?

1105
00:38:15,836 --> 00:38:17,807
You're not choosing someone to go out with.

1106
00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,136
- It's just a game. - Choose someone.

1107
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,276
Me?

1108
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:23,377
Why are you not looking at Hyo Seop?

1109
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:25,176
It's not like that.

1110
00:38:25,247 --> 00:38:27,176
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Why?

1111
00:38:27,176 --> 00:38:28,477
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1112
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,676
- Why? - Why?

1113
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:31,517
- We don't want to. - Why do we have to compete for you?

1114
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:32,546
You choose someone.

1115
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:34,086
- You're being ridiculous. - What are you doing?

1116
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:36,187
Why would we do that? We don't want to.

1117
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:38,356
- Just play rock-paper-scissors. - We don't want to.

1118
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:40,497
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - You four.

1119
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:41,526
The winner becomes her partner?

1120
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:43,367
- The winner. - Hold on.

1121
00:38:43,367 --> 00:38:45,426
I hate the fact that we're doing this.

1122
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,037
If you don't show anything, you lose.

1123
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:48,367
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1124
00:38:48,566 --> 00:38:50,466
(Win, win, lose, lose)

1125
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:51,867
Okay.

1126
00:38:51,867 --> 00:38:55,437
(The losers are happier.)

1127
00:38:55,437 --> 00:38:58,377
- Why are you so happy? - I mean...

1128
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,077
I really hope Jong Kook will win.

1129
00:39:00,077 --> 00:39:01,077
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1130
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:03,647
- The winner becomes her partner. - You have to win me.

1131
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:04,886
She says we have to win her.

1132
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,886
(You have to win me.)

1133
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,617
(We'd rather lose.)

1134
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:10,156
I hate it.

1135
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:11,356
Rock-paper-scissors

1136
00:39:11,356 --> 00:39:15,227
(I'll lose so that I don't have to win you.)

1137
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:16,667
(Who will win So Min?)

1138
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:17,767
Rock-paper-scissors

1139
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,466
(So Min becomes Jong Kook's.)

1140
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:24,836
(You're happy?)

1141
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:26,736
Jong Kook looked happy.

1142
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:28,776
(Jong Kook looks happy.)

1143
00:39:29,377 --> 00:39:30,506
(Jong Kook wins So Min in the end.)

1144
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,546
My goodness.

1145
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,106
- I like it. - Okay.

1146
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:34,946
- I love it. - It's so funny.

1147
00:39:34,977 --> 00:39:36,617
I love the result.

1148
00:39:36,647 --> 00:39:37,787
It's so funny.

1149
00:39:37,847 --> 00:39:39,347
The competition was so fierce.

1150
00:39:39,716 --> 00:39:41,586
- It was. - By the way,

1151
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,287
Hyo Seop needs to think about this matter.

1152
00:39:43,287 --> 00:39:45,327
This has never happened before.

1153
00:39:45,586 --> 00:39:48,097
He is the first male guest who didn't get chosen.

1154
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:49,597
He should...

1155
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,127
- He shouldn't be sitting here. - His agency should think...

1156
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,966
After the shooting,

1157
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,566
- his agency should have a meeting. - He shouldn't be sitting here.

1158
00:39:55,566 --> 00:39:57,836
- He... - This is what I thought.

1159
00:39:58,136 --> 00:39:59,136
"Wait."

1160
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:02,437
"You're the first girl who didn't choose me."

1161
00:40:02,437 --> 00:40:03,647
That's why.

1162
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:04,877
Was that your intention?

1163
00:40:04,877 --> 00:40:05,877
Seriously...

1164
00:40:05,877 --> 00:40:07,477
Focus on the show.

1165
00:40:07,477 --> 00:40:08,847
(Male lead Ahn Hyo Seop)

1166
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:10,187
"I'm glad it's you."

1167
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:12,046
(Female lead Jeon So Min)

1168
00:40:12,046 --> 00:40:13,256
All right.

1169
00:40:13,256 --> 00:40:15,017
Stay on alert, Ji Hyo. It's a group game.

1170
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:16,486
You have to say a celebrity's name.

1171
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:18,127
- A celebrity's name? - A celebrity's name.

1172
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:19,227
It's a celebrity's name.

1173
00:40:19,227 --> 00:40:20,356
The ghosts will try to fail.

1174
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:21,597
They definitely will.

1175
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:22,696
It's easy to fail.

1176
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:23,966
That's right.

1177
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,526
Start. Yu.

1178
00:40:26,526 --> 00:40:27,696
- Jae. - Seok.

1179
00:40:27,696 --> 00:40:28,836
That was easy.

1180
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:30,006
- Park. - Jae.

1181
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:31,006
Beom.

1182
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,537
- Is this how you do it? - Choi.

1183
00:40:32,537 --> 00:40:33,636
- Chang. - Min.

1184
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:36,877
But celebrity names are easy.

1185
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:38,307
It's easy.

1186
00:40:38,307 --> 00:40:39,477
Good job.

1187
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,347
- Bravo. - Good job.

1188
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,446
(Haha and Ji Hyo win a dish.)

1189
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,386
All right. It's celebrity names again.

1190
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:47,957
- What should I do? - It's easy.

1191
00:40:48,316 --> 00:40:49,716
Ready.

1192
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:50,856
- Start. - Ko.

1193
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:52,256
- So. - Young.

1194
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:53,627
Yoon.

1195
00:40:53,627 --> 00:40:55,127
- Je. - Pil.

1196
00:40:55,127 --> 00:40:57,566
(Yoon Je Pil?)

1197
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:58,597
Hold on.

1198
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:00,597
Who is Yoon Je Pil?

1199
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:01,767
- She meant Yoon Je Moon. - Yoon Je Moon.

1200
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:02,997
He's definitely a ghost.

1201
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,037
That's not it.

1202
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:05,537
He's 100 percent a ghost.

1203
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:07,676
Which celebrity's name starts with "Yoon Je"?

1204
00:41:08,106 --> 00:41:10,176
- There are many. - All right.

1205
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:12,446
You failed, so you lose a dish.

1206
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:13,747
- What should we take away? - Dried seaweed.

1207
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,716
- Dried seaweed. - I'm sick of it.

1208
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:17,546
But it's too predictable.

1209
00:41:17,546 --> 00:41:19,086
- It might have a good hint. - Take away the dried seaweed.

1210
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,086
It's hard.

1211
00:41:21,886 --> 00:41:23,627
- Let's move on. - Is it our turn?

1212
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:25,457
- The dried seaweed was taken away. - It's me and Na Eun's turn.

1213
00:41:25,486 --> 00:41:26,897
It's food names this time.

1214
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:28,156
- Food. - Okay.

1215
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,656
I'm confident.

1216
00:41:29,656 --> 00:41:30,867
- Here we go. - Food.

1217
00:41:31,627 --> 00:41:33,336
- Start. - Gim.

1218
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,867
I thought Na Eun was going first.

1219
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,566
(I thought Na Eun was going first.)

1220
00:41:37,307 --> 00:41:39,506
- Hold on. - Let us try again.

1221
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:41,336
- Is Jae Seok a ghost? - Is Jae Seok a ghost?

1222
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:42,906
He gave me the chills.

1223
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:44,247
- You gave me goosebumps. - That's not it.

1224
00:41:44,247 --> 00:41:45,347
What should we do?

1225
00:41:45,347 --> 00:41:46,747
- That's not it. - It was Jae Seok?

1226
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:47,946
I'm not a ghost.

1227
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:50,747
I just froze. I thought Na Eun was going first.

1228
00:41:50,747 --> 00:41:53,256
- It's food names. - It's easy with categories.

1229
00:41:53,356 --> 00:41:54,586
- Right. - Okay.

1230
00:41:54,756 --> 00:41:56,256
Start. Gim.

1231
00:41:57,086 --> 00:41:58,127
Bap.

1232
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:01,796
(Only two syllables?)

1233
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,026
You could have said, "gimmari."

1234
00:42:03,127 --> 00:42:05,097
- He just ended it. - Gosh.

1235
00:42:05,097 --> 00:42:06,836
He only cares about himself.

1236
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:08,136
This is not okay.

1237
00:42:08,136 --> 00:42:09,367
He's so selfish.

1238
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:10,466
- He's suspicious. - Hold on.

1239
00:42:10,466 --> 00:42:11,707
- Are you a ghost? - No.

1240
00:42:11,707 --> 00:42:13,377
- Let me try again. - He just ended it.

1241
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:14,506
What are you talking about?

1242
00:42:14,506 --> 00:42:15,537
Another dish will be taken away.

1243
00:42:15,537 --> 00:42:16,946
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

1244
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:18,707
Hold on. Na Eun didn't get to say anything.

1245
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:20,546
- He said, "gimbap." - Let us try again.

1246
00:42:20,546 --> 00:42:22,847
- It just happened. - "Gimbap."

1247
00:42:23,216 --> 00:42:24,347
- Period. - Period.

1248
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:25,586
- He just ended it. - He ended it.

1249
00:42:25,586 --> 00:42:27,156
- He put a period. - It's so funny.

1250
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:29,417
One dish will be taken away.

1251
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,727
Hyo Seop, choose one dish.

1252
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:33,397
- Please take away anchovies. - Okay.

1253
00:42:33,597 --> 00:42:34,656
(Hyo Seop is squeezed to half.)

1254
00:42:34,656 --> 00:42:36,497
- He's scared. - He feels uncomfortable.

1255
00:42:36,497 --> 00:42:38,426
- Do you want to switch? - His shoulders were squeezed.

1256
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:40,097
You like it, right?

1257
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:41,437
- You like sitting next to me? - Yes, I do.

1258
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:42,997
Hyo Seop is sweating again.

1259
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:44,406
He's covered in sweat.

1260
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,466
It's nice to rest on his shoulders.

1261
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,676
They're so broad.

1262
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:51,506
I hope we'll have Lee Soon Jae as a guest someday.

1263
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:53,276
I want to see if Jong Kook will put his arm on his shoulder.

1264
00:42:53,276 --> 00:42:54,276
Me too.

1265
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,287
I shouldn't do that.

1266
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:59,117
So Min.

1267
00:42:59,486 --> 00:43:01,057
Okay. Focus.

1268
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:02,287
So Min, let's do this.

1269
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,886
Let's show them.

1270
00:43:03,886 --> 00:43:06,026
This time, it's animals.

1271
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:07,756
- That's good. - I like it.

1272
00:43:07,756 --> 00:43:09,897
- It's good. - It's too easy.

1273
00:43:09,897 --> 00:43:11,497
Start. Song.

1274
00:43:11,497 --> 00:43:12,696
- A. - Ji.

1275
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,336
- Oh. - Ri.

1276
00:43:14,336 --> 00:43:15,437
Bal.

1277
00:43:15,437 --> 00:43:18,236
(Duck feet?)

1278
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:20,136
- That's not an animal. - Duck feet?

1279
00:43:20,236 --> 00:43:22,037
What are you doing?

1280
00:43:22,037 --> 00:43:23,906
- What's wrong with it? - What's that?

1281
00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:25,477
- You could have said, "osori." - It has to be an animal.

1282
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,506
Duck feet.

1283
00:43:26,506 --> 00:43:28,176
Jong Kook is supposed to be angry with So Min,

1284
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:29,446
but he knows it's his fault,

1285
00:43:29,446 --> 00:43:30,486
so he didn't say anything.

1286
00:43:31,046 --> 00:43:32,086
What's wrong with "duck feet"?

1287
00:43:32,086 --> 00:43:33,917
Why didn't you think of "ojingeo"?

1288
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:35,417
I get it. Stop now.

1289
00:43:35,457 --> 00:43:37,856
- Mr. Gimbap. - Please stop now.

1290
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:39,327
- What are you doing? - You've said it many times.

1291
00:43:39,327 --> 00:43:41,497
- Mr. Gimbap. - Once is enough.

1292
00:43:41,497 --> 00:43:43,156
- How could they not think of it? - My goodness.

1293
00:43:43,156 --> 00:43:45,867
It's not like you did well.

1294
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:48,597
We're the same.

1295
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:50,506
Please choose a dish to be taken away.

1296
00:43:50,937 --> 00:43:52,006
Let's choose japchae.

1297
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,136
Let's take away kimchi.

1298
00:43:53,676 --> 00:43:56,077
I think kimchi has an important hint.

1299
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:57,446
It's possible.

1300
00:43:57,877 --> 00:43:59,807
- They'd think we'd take it away. - Okay.

1301
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,917
- Japchae. - We'll make sure to get it.

1302
00:44:02,147 --> 00:44:03,647
- Let's do celebrity names. - Okay.

1303
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:05,647
- Celebrity names? - Celebrity names.

1304
00:44:05,787 --> 00:44:07,486
- Think of idol groups. - Okay.

1305
00:44:07,617 --> 00:44:09,986
- It might be harder. - Probably.

1306
00:44:09,986 --> 00:44:11,086
- Right. - Let's go.

1307
00:44:11,086 --> 00:44:12,187
Seon.

1308
00:44:12,526 --> 00:44:14,026
- So it's a celebrity? - Seon.

1309
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,696
(It's the same with Jae Seok's strategy.)

1310
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:17,767
It's just a question.

1311
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:18,767
Okay.

1312
00:44:18,767 --> 00:44:19,966
Hyo Seop, you're busted.

1313
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,796
- No. - He's definitely a ghost.

1314
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:24,136
He came back to Korea only recently.

1315
00:44:24,136 --> 00:44:25,207
He did?

1316
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,276
That's why he can't...

1317
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:28,676
- do this game well. - We should give him an advantage.

1318
00:44:28,676 --> 00:44:30,347
Now I understand.

1319
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:32,577
We should have let him say English words.

1320
00:44:32,577 --> 00:44:34,117
Something like "maple syrup."

1321
00:44:34,117 --> 00:44:35,377
You should have given him "ma."

1322
00:44:35,377 --> 00:44:36,477
- What? - "Maple syrup."

1323
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:37,847
That's five syllables.

1324
00:44:37,847 --> 00:44:39,617
- Okay. - Gosh.

1325
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:41,086
What's with him?

1326
00:44:41,256 --> 00:44:42,586
- It's celebrity names. - Celebrity names.

1327
00:44:42,586 --> 00:44:44,187
- I'm sorry. - Group names are okay too.

1328
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:45,827
- Okay. - It might be a group.

1329
00:44:45,827 --> 00:44:47,897
If you can't think of a person's name, think of a group's name.

1330
00:44:47,897 --> 00:44:48,997
Here we go.

1331
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,497
Go.

1332
00:44:50,526 --> 00:44:51,566
Doo.

1333
00:44:52,597 --> 00:44:57,466
(A celebrity whose name starts with "Go Doo" and has 4 syllables?)

1334
00:44:57,466 --> 00:45:00,577
(Even someone who's lived in Korea all his life is not sure.)

1335
00:45:00,577 --> 00:45:02,606
Are you thinking of Go Doo Shim?

1336
00:45:02,707 --> 00:45:03,906
- Hey! - Go Doo Shim.

1337
00:45:03,906 --> 00:45:05,877
- Go Doo Shim. - Go Doo Shim.

1338
00:45:06,077 --> 00:45:07,816
- Go Doo Shim. - Gosh.

1339
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:09,017
Oh, I get it.

1340
00:45:09,077 --> 00:45:11,546
- Hyo Seop, focus. - Kwang Soo.

1341
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:13,386
It's not your fault.

1342
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:14,957
- Go Doo Shim. - It's not your fault.

1343
00:45:14,957 --> 00:45:16,417
- What's with you guys? - Four syllables are hard.

1344
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,586
It's really hard.

1345
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:18,856
- What are you talking about? - I can do three syllables.

1346
00:45:18,856 --> 00:45:20,227
Four syllables are easier.

1347
00:45:20,227 --> 00:45:21,457
- Easier? - Yes.

1348
00:45:21,457 --> 00:45:22,796
- Mr. Gimbap. - What?

1349
00:45:22,796 --> 00:45:24,167
- Aren't you Mr. Gimbap? - Please sit down.

1350
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:26,097
- You can't say that. - Gosh.

1351
00:45:26,097 --> 00:45:27,497
He's Mr. Gimbap.

1352
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,207
Another dish will be taken away.

1353
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,836
- I'd take away grilled pork. - Young Hee.

1354
00:45:31,836 --> 00:45:32,937
It's better to keep it.

1355
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:34,336
- Young Hee should choose. - Grilled pork goes well with rice.

1356
00:45:34,336 --> 00:45:35,977
We should let Young Hee choose.

1357
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:37,106
Hold on.

1358
00:45:37,106 --> 00:45:38,276
Why do you keep hitting me?

1359
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,676
What are you doing?

1360
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:41,676
I don't want to sit between these two.

1361
00:45:41,676 --> 00:45:43,446
- Can't we just talk? - I didn't hit you.

1362
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:44,816
- I didn't hit you. - You did.

1363
00:45:45,787 --> 00:45:46,787
You didn't?

1364
00:45:46,787 --> 00:45:47,856
Apologize to his arm.

1365
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:49,386
Apologize to his arm.

1366
00:45:49,386 --> 00:45:50,386
(Humiliating)

1367
00:45:50,386 --> 00:45:51,426
I didn't hit him.

1368
00:45:51,426 --> 00:45:52,856
- Apologize. - Kiss his arm.

1369
00:45:52,856 --> 00:45:54,656
- Kiss his arm. - Do it.

1370
00:45:54,656 --> 00:45:57,667
(I'm sorry, arm.)

1371
00:45:58,196 --> 00:45:59,296
I'm sorry.

1372
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:00,636
What should we take away?

1373
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,066
- As the others have been saying, - Kimchi.

1374
00:46:03,307 --> 00:46:05,336
I want kimchi to be taken away, not the main dishes.

1375
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:06,707
- Okay. - Okay.

1376
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:09,077
That's a wise choice.

1377
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:10,847
Kimchi has to go.

1378
00:46:10,847 --> 00:46:12,946
We started with six dishes,

1379
00:46:12,946 --> 00:46:14,216
and we've played five rounds so far.

1380
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:17,117
Would you just eat one dish...

1381
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,446
or play another round to win two dishes?

1382
00:46:18,446 --> 00:46:19,957
- Let's play another round. - Should we do that?

1383
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:21,617
- Should we bet 2 dishes? - 2 dishes...

1384
00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:22,856
Who feels confident?

1385
00:46:23,057 --> 00:46:24,486
I'm really confident.

1386
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:25,656
(Go Doo Shim, Mr. Gimbap, Yoon Je Pil)

1387
00:46:25,656 --> 00:46:26,696
I'm really confident.

1388
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:27,696
I'm really good at it.

1389
00:46:27,696 --> 00:46:29,127
I'm really good at this game.

1390
00:46:29,227 --> 00:46:31,497
Since he feels so confident...

1391
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:33,296
What's with your face?

1392
00:46:33,296 --> 00:46:34,767
I feel really confident.

1393
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,167
- You look so serious. - Let me try.

1394
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,406
But...

1395
00:46:37,406 --> 00:46:39,136
if Jae Seok fails this time,

1396
00:46:39,136 --> 00:46:41,377
- it means he's a ghost. - That's right.

1397
00:46:41,377 --> 00:46:43,106
Whether he plays or not,

1398
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:44,276
he is a ghost.

1399
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:47,377
- He doesn't get another chance. - How could you say, "gimbap"?

1400
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:49,176
Jae Seok shouldn't play.

1401
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,917
Okay. Kwang Soo, Young Hee, and Na Eun. What do you think?

1402
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:53,756
- Kwang Soo? - Yes.

1403
00:46:53,756 --> 00:46:55,256
- I'm really good at this game. - Why?

1404
00:46:55,986 --> 00:46:57,086
I feel burdened.

1405
00:46:57,486 --> 00:46:58,627
Kwang Soo. Okay.

1406
00:46:58,627 --> 00:46:59,926
Come here, Kwang Soo.

1407
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:02,557
- We've bet our dishes. Do well. - I'll be serious.

1408
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:03,867
- There's no category. - No.

1409
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:05,966
- Just say any four-syllable word. - Let's do this.

1410
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,167
I can help them.

1411
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:10,236
He wants to help, but I don't think it's a good idea.

1412
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:11,406
I'll help you, so don't worry.

1413
00:47:11,406 --> 00:47:12,537
(Trust me.)

1414
00:47:12,667 --> 00:47:15,207
Here we go. Start.

1415
00:47:15,906 --> 00:47:16,946
S.

1416
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:20,377
(Glancing)

1417
00:47:20,776 --> 00:47:21,877
S.

1418
00:47:22,676 --> 00:47:26,117
(Will Kwang Soo overcome his crisis...)

1419
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:29,090
(with Jae Seok's help?)

1420
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,527
(Glancing)

1421
00:47:32,926 --> 00:47:34,027
S.

1422
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:38,727
(Jae Seok... Help Me....)

1423
00:47:38,865 --> 00:47:41,532
(Kwang Soo...)

1424
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:44,030
(Kwang Soo... I'm sorry.)

1425
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,122
You said you'd help me.

1426
00:47:46,147 --> 00:47:47,748
Why did you avoid my eyes?

1427
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:51,078
- He said that he'd help me. - There's Sri Lanka.

1428
00:47:51,078 --> 00:47:52,578
You didn't help me.

1429
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,987
- You said that you'd do well. - That's not it.

1430
00:47:54,987 --> 00:47:56,147
- It was "S." - Why did you look at me?

1431
00:47:56,147 --> 00:47:58,458
How could you?

1432
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,328
Listen. I was embarrassed.

1433
00:48:02,328 --> 00:48:03,857
Kwang Soo looked at me.

1434
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,458
He avoided my eyes.

1435
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:07,627
I reached for him.

1436
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:08,797
He ignored me.

1437
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:11,067
You lost all the dishes.

1438
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:12,768
By the way...

1439
00:48:12,768 --> 00:48:13,837
(They fail to win food and hints.)

1440
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:15,538
- Gosh. - We have to eat soy sauce.

1441
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,808
I got a feeling of who the ghosts are.

1442
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:20,178
I know who they are.

1443
00:48:20,337 --> 00:48:22,777
The big brother is Jae Seok.

1444
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:24,348
It's Jae Seok.

1445
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:25,618
Come on, So Min.

1446
00:48:25,618 --> 00:48:27,587
(Is Jae Seok really a ghost?)

1447
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,547
What's this?

1448
00:48:29,547 --> 00:48:31,257
(There are four rooms with holes on the doors.)

1449
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:33,087
Here's your second mission.

1450
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:36,087
It's Get Out, It's Overcrowded.

1451
00:48:36,087 --> 00:48:37,527
(Get Out, It's Overcrowded)

1452
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:41,397
Listen to the question. Choose among four choices.

1453
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:45,067
Enter the room of the number that you think is the answer.

1454
00:48:45,067 --> 00:48:48,067
Only four people can be in each room.

1455
00:48:48,837 --> 00:48:50,808
Within a limited time,

1456
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:54,208
you must claim your spot by pushing out extra members.

1457
00:48:54,507 --> 00:48:55,848
Can we push?

1458
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:57,208
We have to push.

1459
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,317
Goodness.

1460
00:48:59,118 --> 00:49:00,377
Jong Kook is getting ready.

1461
00:49:00,377 --> 00:49:01,388
(Intimidating)

1462
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,447
He's getting ready by taking off his bag.

1463
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:04,817
Why are you getting ready?

1464
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,357
Why are you taking off your bag?

1465
00:49:06,357 --> 00:49:07,728
Why are you getting ready?

1466
00:49:07,728 --> 00:49:08,788
I have to.

1467
00:49:08,788 --> 00:49:10,388
He took off his bag.

1468
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:11,458
(Be gentle, Jong Kook.)

1469
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:14,228
Wait, So Min. Did you drink during the day?

1470
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,498
(Laughing)

1471
00:49:16,027 --> 00:49:17,598
What's wrong with So Min?

1472
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:18,797
It's because...

1473
00:49:18,797 --> 00:49:20,868
So Min got a lot of sea breeze during her drama shoot.

1474
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:22,938
- She got tanned. - I was on an island.

1475
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:25,237
When you concentrate on acting,

1476
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,047
only your mind changes, not your looks.

1477
00:49:28,107 --> 00:49:29,777
She got completely into it.

1478
00:49:29,777 --> 00:49:31,078
Is that so?

1479
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:33,578
Sea breeze got on her face.

1480
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:35,118
Get ready.

1481
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:37,288
Here's your first question.

1482
00:49:38,288 --> 00:49:41,257
When is Halloween...

1483
00:49:41,357 --> 00:49:43,728
in the US?

1484
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:45,658
Okay, I know this one.

1485
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:48,998
One, last Saturday of every October.

1486
00:49:49,768 --> 00:49:54,337
Two, last Sunday of every October.

1487
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:58,877
Three, every October 30th.

1488
00:49:59,737 --> 00:50:03,377
Four, every October 31st.

1489
00:50:03,748 --> 00:50:05,047
- This is confusing. - What is it?

1490
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:06,217
We haven't started yet.

1491
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:07,217
This is confusing.

1492
00:50:07,217 --> 00:50:08,788
- It's October 31st. - October 31st.

1493
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:09,987
- We have to get it. - 31st.

1494
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:11,257
Is it number three?

1495
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:13,288
- It's 31st. - Is it 31st?

1496
00:50:13,788 --> 00:50:16,388
(We think it's number 4, October 31st.)

1497
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:17,697
We need to push someone out.

1498
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,928
(Let's push out Na Eun.)

1499
00:50:23,197 --> 00:50:27,237
(Bye, Na Eun. This is how far we've come.)

1500
00:50:27,808 --> 00:50:31,107
(He was happy to see her when she came.)

1501
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:34,147
(You ignored me completely.)

1502
00:50:34,147 --> 00:50:38,078
(You only focus on work.)

1503
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,647
(I'll work too.)

1504
00:50:40,647 --> 00:50:42,018
How dare you come here?

1505
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:44,357
(I'm going to wake up now.)

1506
00:50:45,688 --> 00:50:48,428
(It's your turn, Se Chan.)

1507
00:50:48,688 --> 00:50:50,328
You don't belong here.

1508
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:52,357
You don't belong.

1509
00:50:53,527 --> 00:50:56,127
(They thrust him out.)

1510
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,237
(Where should I go now?)

1511
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:01,208
I have nowhere to go.

1512
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,308
(I can't go where Na Eun is.)

1513
00:51:04,408 --> 00:51:06,478
(He goes to number 1.)

1514
00:51:07,078 --> 00:51:09,047
The answer is number four.

1515
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:12,947
It's October 31st.

1516
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:14,788
- Is 31st right? - It's 31st.

1517
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:15,848
It's 31st.

1518
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,458
The answer is...

1519
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:19,658
(What is the answer?)

1520
00:51:19,658 --> 00:51:21,987
- Number four, October 31st. - Okay.

1521
00:51:22,627 --> 00:51:24,828
(It's a day before All Saint's Day, November 1st.)

1522
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:26,627
- What? - What?

1523
00:51:29,197 --> 00:51:32,667
(Their faces are smashed with flour.)

1524
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:35,308
(Seok Jin gets some.)

1525
00:51:36,067 --> 00:51:38,507
(Some foundation is applied on So Min's red face.)

1526
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:40,507
(What's this?)

1527
00:51:40,507 --> 00:51:43,147
(Is this what variety shows are about?)

1528
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:44,917
Your approach is frightening.

1529
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,288
(He gets a slap for being a traitor.)

1530
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:50,917
Everyone in room number four gets one point.

1531
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:51,987
Thank you.

1532
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:53,458
I'm sorry, Na Eun.

1533
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:55,257
(I'm sorry, Na Eun.)

1534
00:51:55,288 --> 00:51:57,458
Next question is very easy. Here it is.

1535
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,058
- Okay. - Let's fight.

1536
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:00,868
To prevent misfortune,

1537
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:02,998
our ancestors ate this...

1538
00:52:03,297 --> 00:52:06,297
which has a similar color to Cheoyong's face.

1539
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:07,368
Right.

1540
00:52:07,368 --> 00:52:08,567
What is this?

1541
00:52:08,567 --> 00:52:09,908
Yes, I know.

1542
00:52:09,908 --> 00:52:11,277
- "Cheoyong"? - Sister-in-law?

1543
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:14,478
One, ginkgo fruit.

1544
00:52:14,607 --> 00:52:15,647
(Peeking)

1545
00:52:15,647 --> 00:52:17,547
Two, walnut.

1546
00:52:18,447 --> 00:52:19,978
Three, red bean porridge.

1547
00:52:19,978 --> 00:52:21,047
(I'm ready too.)

1548
00:52:21,047 --> 00:52:25,018
(Jae Seok knows the answer. Let's follow him.)

1549
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:26,118
(Everyone follows Jae Seok.)

1550
00:52:26,118 --> 00:52:27,458
Is it red bean porridge?

1551
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,388
(Everyone runs to red bean porridge.)

1552
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:31,328
Don't come in here.

1553
00:52:31,757 --> 00:52:33,027
What did you say?

1554
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:34,428
- Sister-in-law? - It's Cheoyong.

1555
00:52:34,428 --> 00:52:36,027
- "Cheoyong"? - Cheoyong.

1556
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,538
- Why did everyone come here? - Please.

1557
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:38,667
Why did everyone come here?

1558
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:40,237
Leave.

1559
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,938
(It's a chaos in room number 3.)

1560
00:52:41,938 --> 00:52:43,538
I'll survive.

1561
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:46,237
Is it walnut or peanut?

1562
00:52:46,237 --> 00:52:48,007
- Peanut wasn't a choice. - Is it walnut?

1563
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:49,708
(My answer when I'm confused...)

1564
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,047
I'll stay with Hyo Seop.

1565
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:52,478
(Smiling)

1566
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:55,587
(My answer is you.)

1567
00:52:55,587 --> 00:52:58,058
- I think it's number three. - I'll close the door to keep him.

1568
00:52:58,058 --> 00:52:59,788
(How dare you?)

1569
00:52:59,788 --> 00:53:01,757
(I caught you.)

1570
00:53:01,757 --> 00:53:03,458
I'll close it to keep you.

1571
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:06,958
(This is a real Halloween date.)

1572
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,397
Push him out.

1573
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,167
(They're still fighting for their spot.)

1574
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:11,268
That hurts.

1575
00:53:11,737 --> 00:53:12,768
Hey.

1576
00:53:13,038 --> 00:53:16,038
(He's thrown out again.)

1577
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:19,308
(And the man who always fails...)

1578
00:53:19,308 --> 00:53:21,808
(He gets eliminated as always.)

1579
00:53:22,178 --> 00:53:24,078
(Red bean porridge is the answer.)

1580
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:25,348
Red bean porridge is against misfortune.

1581
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:26,848
It could be peanuts too.

1582
00:53:26,848 --> 00:53:28,487
Whom should I help?

1583
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:29,518
Who?

1584
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:30,987
- Who is it? - It could be peanuts too.

1585
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:32,257
Who shall it be? 2, 4.

1586
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:33,458
- Six. - Whose face is clean?

1587
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:35,328
- Three of you should leave. - Whose face is clean?

1588
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:36,828
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - No way.

1589
00:53:36,828 --> 00:53:38,257
Come here.

1590
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,757
Come here.

1591
00:53:39,757 --> 00:53:42,228
(Did you push me out a moment ago?)

1592
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,297
(Dragging)

1593
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:45,837
Come here. Who else?

1594
00:53:45,938 --> 00:53:47,967
- Who else? Ji Hyo? - Ji Hyo.

1595
00:53:47,967 --> 00:53:49,708
- Who else? Ji Hyo? - No way.

1596
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,337
(Next target is Ji Hyo.)

1597
00:53:51,638 --> 00:53:53,737
- Come here. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

1598
00:53:53,737 --> 00:53:55,107
(She helped Kwang Soo and pushed me out.)

1599
00:53:56,277 --> 00:53:58,917
(Why did Jae Seok step out?)

1600
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,078
We got it.

1601
00:54:00,748 --> 00:54:02,248
(He went to see Ji Hyo.)

1602
00:54:02,248 --> 00:54:04,888
(He got pushed out.)

1603
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:07,058
(I want to go back in.)

1604
00:54:07,058 --> 00:54:08,757
- We got it. - Hey.

1605
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,328
I said the answer.

1606
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:13,498
- It was me. - It can't be walnuts.

1607
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:14,797
- I said it. - It's walnuts.

1608
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:17,167
- Close the door. - It's red bean porridge.

1609
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:19,868
- Close the door. - It's red bean porridge.

1610
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:21,868
My goodness.

1611
00:54:21,868 --> 00:54:23,868
- That's so funny. - It's red bean porridge.

1612
00:54:23,868 --> 00:54:25,777
- What's Cheoyong? - It isn't walnuts.

1613
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:27,978
- What is sister-in-law? - It's Cheoyong.

1614
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:29,107
What does it mean?

1615
00:54:29,107 --> 00:54:30,647
- Let me tell you the answer. - Red bean porridge.

1616
00:54:32,047 --> 00:54:33,447
It's number three, red bean porridge.

1617
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:34,817
(Red bean porridge is the answer.)

1618
00:54:34,817 --> 00:54:36,047
(Cheoyong's face is red.)

1619
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:37,047
We got it.

1620
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:38,958
I want some red bean porridge.

1621
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:40,217
(That's why our ancestors ate red bean porridge.)

1622
00:54:41,428 --> 00:54:42,757
It's water.

1623
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:43,788
(Splashing)

1624
00:54:43,788 --> 00:54:46,328
(Water will cleanse off their misfortune.)

1625
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:48,297
What's this?

1626
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:53,197
I'm so glad that I didn't get water on my face after the flour.

1627
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:56,268
(Jong Kook, Haha, Young Hee, and Na Eun win 1 point.)

1628
00:54:57,308 --> 00:54:58,808
Here's the third question.

1629
00:54:58,808 --> 00:55:03,748
Which actress did not play the nine-tailed fox?

1630
00:55:03,908 --> 00:55:05,518
One, Ko So Young.

1631
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:07,587
Two, Kim Tae Hee.

1632
00:55:07,947 --> 00:55:09,688
Three, Shin Min A.

1633
00:55:09,688 --> 00:55:11,087
Four, Min Hyo Rin.

1634
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:14,627
Three, Shin Min A.

1635
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:16,158
- Four, Min Hyo Rin. - Wait.

1636
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:17,928
What is it?

1637
00:55:18,598 --> 00:55:19,697
What?

1638
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,268
What?

1639
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:24,397
What is it?

1640
00:55:24,397 --> 00:55:25,567
What was number three?

1641
00:55:25,567 --> 00:55:27,098
Isn't number three Shin Min A?

1642
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:28,308
Wait a minute.

1643
00:55:28,308 --> 00:55:29,868
I'll use force. Who will it be?

1644
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,038
Okay.

1645
00:55:31,038 --> 00:55:32,377
Who didn't get water?

1646
00:55:32,478 --> 00:55:33,837
It's 1 of the 2, right?

1647
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:35,377
It's you.

1648
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,248
I'm sorry, Young Hee.

1649
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:38,578
(The target is Young Hee this time.)

1650
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:42,447
(She hops away.)

1651
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:43,717
She's going somewhere.

1652
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:47,428
(Who will be at the next door?)

1653
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,627
Next is So Min. Come here.

1654
00:55:49,627 --> 00:55:50,897
(Get out, So Min.)

1655
00:55:50,897 --> 00:55:52,158
- Get out. - Okay.

1656
00:55:52,158 --> 00:55:53,797
- Good job. - Get out.

1657
00:55:53,797 --> 00:55:55,567
- All right. - My beloved.

1658
00:55:55,567 --> 00:55:56,768
- Let's go, Hyo Seop. - Okay.

1659
00:55:56,768 --> 00:55:58,038
(Let's go, Hyo Seop.)

1660
00:55:58,038 --> 00:55:59,098
Let's go.

1661
00:55:59,467 --> 00:56:00,967
Let's go. What was number one?

1662
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:02,467
- I can't remember. - Who was number one?

1663
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:03,708
Both number 1 and 2 are incorrect.

1664
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:04,908
What were the choices?

1665
00:56:04,908 --> 00:56:07,877
1, Ko So Young. 2, Kim Tae Hee. 3, Shin Min A. 4, Min Hyo Rin.

1666
00:56:07,877 --> 00:56:09,748
Everyone played it.

1667
00:56:09,748 --> 00:56:11,478
- All of them are answers. - This is clear.

1668
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:14,688
(She doesn't want to be penalized.)

1669
00:56:15,417 --> 00:56:17,388
(She runs away.)

1670
00:56:17,487 --> 00:56:19,458
(Where I go is the way.)

1671
00:56:19,458 --> 00:56:20,658
Where are you going?

1672
00:56:20,788 --> 00:56:22,127
Where are you going?

1673
00:56:22,127 --> 00:56:23,228
(Where is she going?)

1674
00:56:23,228 --> 00:56:25,257
- So Min, come back. - Where is she going?

1675
00:56:25,458 --> 00:56:28,027
(She runs away from penalty.)

1676
00:56:28,797 --> 00:56:29,967
What is she doing?

1677
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,337
(She is one of a kind.)

1678
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:33,837
I'm running away.

1679
00:56:33,967 --> 00:56:36,708
I want to run away.

1680
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:38,908
I'll announce the answer.

1681
00:56:39,007 --> 00:56:40,337
The answer is...

1682
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:42,647
(Is it Kim Tae Hee or Min Hyo Rin?)

1683
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:44,178
- Number four, Min Hyo Rin. - Okay.

1684
00:56:44,178 --> 00:56:45,277
(Min Hyo Rin is the answer.)

1685
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,518
Okay, that was good.

1686
00:56:47,518 --> 00:56:49,188
Do it on my cheek.

1687
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:50,248
- On my cheek. - Wait a minute.

1688
00:56:50,248 --> 00:56:52,618
(They get nine-tailed fox makeup with flour.)

1689
00:56:54,587 --> 00:56:55,928
(So Min comes back late.)

1690
00:56:55,928 --> 00:56:58,127
Give it to me. Give it.

1691
00:56:58,127 --> 00:57:00,728
I got it wrong too.

1692
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:02,297
(She confesses to get a lighter punishment.)

1693
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:04,567
(Dabbing)

1694
00:57:05,897 --> 00:57:08,368
(The biter gets bitten.)

1695
00:57:09,607 --> 00:57:11,208
(Her face is white as snow.)

1696
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:12,737
That was mean.

1697
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,007
That was too much.

1698
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:16,408
Here's the next question.

1699
00:57:16,408 --> 00:57:17,547
(This is the third question on horror movies.)

1700
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:18,678
Why is it so long?

1701
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,947
- I think it's number two. - Right?

1702
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,917
- It's "A Tale of Two Sisters." - I was right.

1703
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:24,217
(Jong Kook, Na Eun, Young Hee, and Kwang Soo earn 1 point each.)

1704
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:25,757
- Okay! - This is awesome.

1705
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:27,487
I knew it'd be "A Tale of Two Sisters."

1706
00:57:28,188 --> 00:57:32,158
Jong Kook and Na Eun are currently in first place.

1707
00:57:32,397 --> 00:57:33,658
(Both of them have earned three points.)

1708
00:57:33,757 --> 00:57:35,498
I'm going to throw her out next time.

1709
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:36,967
We have to keep watching.

1710
00:57:36,967 --> 00:57:39,237
You know one of them is the ghost, right?

1711
00:57:39,297 --> 00:57:41,507
It's true. They're trying so hard.

1712
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:42,808
(Are they trying to get all the hints?)

1713
00:57:42,808 --> 00:57:45,138
- Does that mean we're ghosts? - Yes, it does.

1714
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:46,877
- Why? - You don't want us to get hints.

1715
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:49,447
- That's not true. This is a chance. - You two...

1716
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:51,277
(Jong Kook and Na Eun are suspicious.)

1717
00:57:52,217 --> 00:57:53,947
(Current Ranks)

1718
00:57:53,947 --> 00:57:55,447
Here's the final question.

1719
00:57:55,547 --> 00:57:57,288
This is a difficult question, but it's worth two points.

1720
00:57:57,288 --> 00:57:58,658
- Good. - Okay.

1721
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:00,928
I'm going to turn the table around. Let's go.

1722
00:58:01,658 --> 00:58:04,558
Male ghosts who died without getting married...

1723
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:06,627
are called Bachelor Ghosts.

1724
00:58:07,127 --> 00:58:08,368
I knew this.

1725
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:11,368
What's another word for Bachelor Ghosts?

1726
00:58:11,368 --> 00:58:14,237
- Okay. - Number one, Egg Ghost.

1727
00:58:14,237 --> 00:58:16,467
Number two, Bride Ghost.

1728
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:18,737
Number three, Solo Ghost.

1729
00:58:18,737 --> 00:58:21,047
Number four, Triplets Ghost.

1730
00:58:21,047 --> 00:58:22,478
(What's another name for Bachelor Ghosts?)

1731
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:25,277
(Their answers differ.)

1732
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:28,087
What are you doing, Se Chan?

1733
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,047
It's over once the door is closed.

1734
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:32,217
- I have to go in. - Pull.

1735
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,917
- Come this way. - We have to go in.

1736
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:36,857
- It's closed. - Let me go in.

1737
00:58:36,857 --> 00:58:38,857
- Give me one spot. - It's closed.

1738
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:41,397
(He takes the last spot.)

1739
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:43,328
Are you coming in?

1740
00:58:43,697 --> 00:58:45,098
- Where do I go? - Give me one spot.

1741
00:58:45,098 --> 00:58:49,237
(He's desperate and sticks his head in first.)

1742
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:51,007
He's in.

1743
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,007
(He's actually in.)

1744
00:58:52,007 --> 00:58:53,947
- No! - Come in.

1745
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,908
(Give me my spot back!)

1746
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:58,447
No!

1747
00:58:58,817 --> 00:58:59,817
Move over.

1748
00:59:00,018 --> 00:59:02,018
- I'll move. - Move.

1749
00:59:02,018 --> 00:59:03,188
(What's another name for Bachelor Ghosts?)

1750
00:59:03,188 --> 00:59:05,118
(Kwang Soo stays, and time is over.)

1751
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,757
(What's the answer to the question that's worth 2 points?)

1752
00:59:07,757 --> 00:59:09,428
It's number four, Triplets Ghost.

1753
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,958
- Really? - I knew it.

1754
00:59:11,958 --> 00:59:13,828
- All right! - I remembered this.

1755
00:59:13,828 --> 00:59:15,228
Those are clothespins.

1756
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:16,998
I was so close.

1757
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:18,897
(Clothespins are the last penalty.)

1758
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:20,167
You can't do it there.

1759
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:22,308
You can't clip it there.

1760
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:25,107
(Seok Jin, Jong Kook, Haha, and Kwang Soo earn 2 points each.)

1761
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:26,938
- See? - I told you.

1762
00:59:27,507 --> 00:59:30,178
(What's that?)

1763
00:59:30,178 --> 00:59:32,217
I remembered Triplets Ghost.

1764
00:59:32,817 --> 00:59:34,947
See? I told you it was right.

1765
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:35,947
(Kwang Soo can't come out.)

1766
00:59:36,748 --> 00:59:37,958
- How did you get in? - I don't know.

1767
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,257
Hold on to me.

1768
00:59:39,388 --> 00:59:41,388
- How did he get in? - He's in trouble.

1769
00:59:41,388 --> 00:59:42,458
How did he get in?

1770
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:44,027
How did you get in?

1771
00:59:44,357 --> 00:59:46,127
- Help me. - Go forward.

1772
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,828
- He can't get out. - Go forward.

1773
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:49,098
Come here.

1774
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:52,098
- Points your arms forward. - In 1, 2, 3.

1775
00:59:52,098 --> 00:59:54,308
- Point your arms forward. - It worked.

1776
00:59:54,308 --> 00:59:56,967
(Kwang Soo is rescued.)

1777
00:59:56,967 --> 00:59:58,478
How did you get in?

1778
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:00,138
I don't know.

1779
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,607
(He almost became a ghost himself.)

1780
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:05,277
Jong Kook is in first place.

1781
01:00:05,678 --> 01:00:07,217
I got a hint.

1782
01:00:07,587 --> 01:00:09,018
If he's a ghost, this game is over.

1783
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:11,757
- Kwang Soo is in second place. - Okay!

1784
01:00:12,357 --> 01:00:14,188
You got the final question because of me,

1785
01:00:14,188 --> 01:00:15,487
so you have to share the hint.

1786
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,728
- What? - You got it because of me.

1787
01:00:16,728 --> 01:00:18,397
It was because of me. You were going for Egg Ghost...

1788
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:19,697
That was my spot.

1789
01:00:19,697 --> 01:00:21,297
I told you to go there.

1790
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:24,498
(Stop taking the credit.)

1791
01:00:24,498 --> 01:00:26,297
- How's this... - Well...

1792
01:00:26,297 --> 01:00:28,908
Did you think I was going to show you?

1793
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:30,038
But it's true.

1794
01:00:30,038 --> 01:00:31,737
Did you think I was a fool?

1795
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:33,408
It's true though.

1796
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:37,377
(He's looking at the hint by himself.)

1797
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:40,078
(Let me be the only one to know for now.)

1798
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:41,848
What's this?

1799
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:43,817
(Hint for the second place)

1800
01:00:43,817 --> 01:00:44,817
What...

1801
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:47,828
(The second ghost is a daughter.)

1802
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:50,027
- What is it? - Never mind.

1803
01:00:50,027 --> 01:00:51,498
(There are 2 boys and 1 girl. The 2nd one is a daughter?)

1804
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:53,857
- What is it? Share. - Was there a name?

1805
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:56,127
Let's move to the final location.

1806
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:57,127
All right!

1807
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:58,297
(It's boy, girl, and boy. Who's the daughter?)

1808
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,768
The last mission to conquer the ghosts...

1809
01:01:03,408 --> 01:01:04,978
is Find the Hidden Ghosts.

1810
01:01:04,978 --> 01:01:06,777
(Final mission, Find the Hidden Ghosts)

1811
01:01:06,777 --> 01:01:08,007
"Find the Hidden Ghosts"?

1812
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:13,547
Humans must find the ghosts and ways to conquer them.

1813
01:01:13,547 --> 01:01:15,288
They win when all the ghosts are eliminated.

1814
01:01:15,288 --> 01:01:17,888
Ghosts must rip the name tags of humans,

1815
01:01:17,888 --> 01:01:20,018
and they win when all humans are eliminated.

1816
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:22,558
It's more complicated for humans.

1817
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:24,558
We have to find the ways while we're running away.

1818
01:01:24,928 --> 01:01:28,328
Hints about the ghosts...

1819
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:32,467
and the weapons are hidden throughout.

1820
01:01:32,467 --> 01:01:34,467
- They are? - There are weapons.

1821
01:01:34,467 --> 01:01:35,908
(They must find the weapons.)

1822
01:01:35,908 --> 01:01:37,107
I see.

1823
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:40,208
The ghosts don't know how they'll be eliminated either.

1824
01:01:40,208 --> 01:01:41,208
Is that so?

1825
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:44,978
(They don't know who the ghosts are.)

1826
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:48,688
It could be Seok Jin or Jae Seok.

1827
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:51,058
This is too difficult. I don't know who the ghosts are.

1828
01:01:51,388 --> 01:01:53,458
I wonder what will happen.

1829
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:55,458
The race starts soon.

1830
01:01:56,487 --> 01:01:59,197
(Will the ghosts rip name tags and win...)

1831
01:01:59,197 --> 01:02:01,667
(or will humans find the weapons and win?)

1832
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,197
- Race starts. - Okay.

1833
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,998
(Find the Hidden Ghosts race starts.)

1834
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:09,107
Let me look at the hints.

1835
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:11,007
(In order for humans to win,)

1836
01:02:11,007 --> 01:02:13,038
(they must find out the identities of the ghosts fast.)

1837
01:02:13,038 --> 01:02:14,047
What boxes are there?

1838
01:02:14,047 --> 01:02:15,147
(They must find out the identities of the ghosts fast.)

1839
01:02:15,877 --> 01:02:17,107
Se Chan.

1840
01:02:17,107 --> 01:02:18,578
(That sounds too sweet.)

1841
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:21,087
(He hears a sweet voice...)

1842
01:02:21,087 --> 01:02:23,388
(from far away as soon as the race starts.)

1843
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:25,688
What is it? Why?

1844
01:02:26,188 --> 01:02:28,188
What's going on?

1845
01:02:28,928 --> 01:02:32,197
(She walks lightly towards me.)

1846
01:02:32,197 --> 01:02:33,397
Go with me.

1847
01:02:33,397 --> 01:02:34,967
(Go with me.)

1848
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,498
(He's so happy.)

1849
01:02:37,498 --> 01:02:38,638
Okay, let's go together.

1850
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:41,567
(It's okay if she's a ghost.)

1851
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:43,007
Go. Take the lead.

1852
01:02:43,007 --> 01:02:44,478
(It's okay if she rips my name tag.)

1853
01:02:44,607 --> 01:02:45,607
(It's fine as long as I can walk with you.)

1854
01:02:45,607 --> 01:02:47,408
Na Eun, are you a ghost?

1855
01:02:47,408 --> 01:02:49,408
(It's fine as long as I can walk with you.)

1856
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,047
What's with you?

1857
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,217
(It makes him smile to look at her.)

1858
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:55,147
This is driving me nuts.

1859
01:02:56,487 --> 01:02:59,317
Don't worry, Na Eun. I'll protect you.

1860
01:02:59,388 --> 01:03:01,658
- He likes her. - What are they doing?

1861
01:03:02,087 --> 01:03:03,087
What's going on?

1862
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,127
- This is strange. - It is.

1863
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:06,297
She's not like that.

1864
01:03:06,297 --> 01:03:08,297
Maybe Na Eun is trying to rip his name tag.

1865
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:09,998
She's Virgin Ghost.

1866
01:03:10,098 --> 01:03:11,697
She's setting the atmosphere.

1867
01:03:11,697 --> 01:03:13,038
That could be true. She's setting the atmosphere.

1868
01:03:13,038 --> 01:03:14,308
She won't be doing that otherwise.

1869
01:03:14,308 --> 01:03:16,408
That has to be it.

1870
01:03:18,107 --> 01:03:21,107
(Is Na Eun luring him so that she can rip his name tag?)

1871
01:03:22,308 --> 01:03:24,348
(What's this?)

1872
01:03:24,348 --> 01:03:26,178
Okay.

1873
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:29,118
(Is this the power of love? He's found a hint.)

1874
01:03:30,147 --> 01:03:31,217
(It's been over 20 years since the 1st ghost made his debut.)

1875
01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:33,118
- Why? - "It's been over 20 years..."

1876
01:03:33,118 --> 01:03:34,228
"since the first ghost made his debut."

1877
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:35,288
(It's been over 20 years since the 1st ghost made his debut.)

1878
01:03:36,928 --> 01:03:40,998
(That's Jong Kook, Jae Seok or Seok Jin.)

1879
01:03:41,127 --> 01:03:43,297
This is so obvious.

1880
01:03:43,297 --> 01:03:45,768
- What is it? - This has to be Seok Jin.

1881
01:03:45,768 --> 01:03:46,797
(Seok Jin is the most likely candidate.)

1882
01:03:46,797 --> 01:03:48,368
This is too obvious.

1883
01:03:48,368 --> 01:03:50,607
- This is Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1884
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:53,478
What? What is it? Share it.

1885
01:03:53,678 --> 01:03:55,047
How long has it been since your debut?

1886
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:56,647
25 years.

1887
01:03:58,277 --> 01:03:59,277
What about you?

1888
01:03:59,817 --> 01:04:00,848
What's this?

1889
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:03,688
"It's been over 20 years since the 1st ghost made his debut."

1890
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:04,958
(He looks at the hint,)

1891
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,388
(and he gets anxious.)

1892
01:04:07,728 --> 01:04:08,857
This has to be Seok Jin.

1893
01:04:08,857 --> 01:04:10,757
(Can 25 years of experience not disguise the panic?)

1894
01:04:10,757 --> 01:04:12,928
Gosh, it's not me.

1895
01:04:13,397 --> 01:04:16,127
I'm warning you. It's not me.

1896
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,667
(He even gives a warning.)

1897
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:21,368
Kwang Soo, I found a hint.

1898
01:04:21,368 --> 01:04:22,808
- Ji Hyo. - What is it?

1899
01:04:23,467 --> 01:04:24,478
(The third ghost is an actor.)

1900
01:04:24,478 --> 01:04:26,877
They said the third ghost is a man.

1901
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:30,078
It says he's an actor.

1902
01:04:30,748 --> 01:04:34,018
(The ghosts are 2 men and 1 woman.)

1903
01:04:34,018 --> 01:04:38,558
(The second one is a daughter.)

1904
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:40,958
(The third ghost is a male.)

1905
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,188
It says he's an actor.

1906
01:04:42,188 --> 01:04:44,558
(If he's an actor...)

1907
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:45,598
You...

1908
01:04:46,197 --> 01:04:47,397
(Hold on. You're an actor too.)

1909
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:48,397
Wait.

1910
01:04:48,397 --> 01:04:49,598
(Hold on. You're an actor too.)

1911
01:04:52,467 --> 01:04:54,107
(She's terrified all of a sudden.)

1912
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:55,868
- It's not me. - Kwang Soo.

1913
01:04:55,868 --> 01:04:58,578
It must be Hyo Seop.

1914
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:01,107
(Don't get any closer.)

1915
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:02,248
I swear it's not me.

1916
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,018
(Is Kwang Soo the third ghost?)

1917
01:05:04,018 --> 01:05:06,618
Kwang Soo, how tall are you?

1918
01:05:06,947 --> 01:05:07,987
191cm.

1919
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,288
(Another hint says the third ghost is over 180cm tall.)

1920
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:10,388
Se Chan.

1921
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:13,587
(It was just the two of them moments ago.)

1922
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:14,958
- Did you figure out anything? - You scared me.

1923
01:05:15,188 --> 01:05:16,788
(He came out of nowhere.)

1924
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:19,297
Wait. Why are you guys surrounding me?

1925
01:05:19,297 --> 01:05:22,098
- It's not me. - Guys.

1926
01:05:22,098 --> 01:05:24,038
Did you figure out anything?

1927
01:05:24,038 --> 01:05:25,498
You're talking better all of a sudden.

1928
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:26,897
I feel like I need to do something.

1929
01:05:26,897 --> 01:05:29,667
- I didn't do anything so far. - Why in front of me?

1930
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:30,877
I'm sure it's Hyo Seop.

1931
01:05:30,877 --> 01:05:32,237
Why? What makes you think so?

1932
01:05:32,237 --> 01:05:35,348
I'm sure. All the hints point to him.

1933
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:38,178
Who's taller than 180cm?

1934
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:40,987
- How tall are you? - Around 179.1cm?

1935
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:42,248
- 179cm? - It's not me.

1936
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:43,817
- I'm sure. - Are you 179cm?

1937
01:05:44,388 --> 01:05:46,087
You're sweating. Are you all right?

1938
01:05:46,087 --> 01:05:48,087
I'm okay. It's hot all of a sudden.

1939
01:05:48,087 --> 01:05:49,388
(Hyo Seop starts to sweat,)

1940
01:05:49,388 --> 01:05:53,558
(and they start to question him.)

1941
01:05:54,397 --> 01:05:57,368
(Haha leaves quietly.)

1942
01:05:59,197 --> 01:06:01,067
I'm going to do something important.

1943
01:06:01,868 --> 01:06:04,038
Look. Look at Hyo Seop.

1944
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:06,808
He's looking for people. He's watching for movements.

1945
01:06:06,808 --> 01:06:08,147
He's not looking for hints.

1946
01:06:08,308 --> 01:06:10,408
All right. As a human,

1947
01:06:11,547 --> 01:06:15,087
I'll uncover the ghosts and die.

1948
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,717
I'm going to follow Hyo Seop.

1949
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:18,357
(He's certain Hyo Seop is a ghost.)

1950
01:06:19,487 --> 01:06:21,188
I'll let him rip my name tag.

1951
01:06:21,188 --> 01:06:22,757
(He carefully walks towards Hyo Seop.)

1952
01:06:23,388 --> 01:06:25,127
How do I get to the first floor?

1953
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:26,197
(Hyo Seop doesn't know anything.)

1954
01:06:26,558 --> 01:06:27,667
It's Hyo Seop.

1955
01:06:27,667 --> 01:06:31,768
(Haha prepares something in hiding.)

1956
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:36,507
(They run into each other.)

1957
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:42,947
(He hides a cell phone behind him and gets closer.)

1958
01:06:42,947 --> 01:06:45,478
(They start running.)

1959
01:06:47,417 --> 01:06:48,487
(Why are they running?)

1960
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:49,587
Hold on.

1961
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:50,717
(What's going on?)

1962
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:52,658
What is this? Haha... Who's that?

1963
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:55,228
(Everyone is confused as a race starts all of a sudden.)

1964
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,228
What?

1965
01:06:57,127 --> 01:06:58,158
Why?

1966
01:06:58,158 --> 01:06:59,228
(What's going on?)

1967
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,297
Hold on.

1968
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:02,028
(He runs away without knowing why.)

1969
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,268
(They chase him without knowing why.)

1970
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:06,867
(Let's catch him first.)

1971
01:07:06,867 --> 01:07:08,007
Wait.

1972
01:07:08,007 --> 01:07:10,467
(Kwang Soo catches him.)

1973
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,007
Hold on.

1974
01:07:12,207 --> 01:07:13,308
I found him.

1975
01:07:13,308 --> 01:07:15,247
- Do you have a weapon? - Haha does.

1976
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:16,348
What is it?

1977
01:07:16,377 --> 01:07:17,547
- Haha. - Where is he?

1978
01:07:17,948 --> 01:07:19,678
Hurry. Eliminate him fast.

1979
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:21,448
(Did he find a weapon to eliminate Hyo Seop?)

1980
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:22,787
Hold on. If we're wrong...

1981
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:24,888
If we're wrong...

1982
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:26,358
Hey.

1983
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:27,787
- Look. - Do you have to take a picture?

1984
01:07:27,787 --> 01:07:28,928
(Is Hyo Seop out when you take a picture with him?)

1985
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:29,957
Is it a selfie?

1986
01:07:30,157 --> 01:07:31,228
- Really? - A selfie?

1987
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:34,568
(He took a selfie.)

1988
01:07:35,528 --> 01:07:40,537
(Will Hyo Seop be eliminated?)

1989
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:42,337
I just wanted to take a selfie with him, but he ran away.

1990
01:07:42,337 --> 01:07:43,837
(He just wanted to take a selfie.)

1991
01:07:44,077 --> 01:07:45,938
I just wanted to take a selfie with him, but he ran away.

1992
01:07:45,938 --> 01:07:47,747
(He tricked everybody.)

1993
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:48,907
Really?

1994
01:07:49,207 --> 01:07:51,917
(It was Haha's way of judging who the ghosts are.)

1995
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,178
This is nothing.

1996
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:55,818
I wanted to take a selfie with him, but he ran away.

1997
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:58,917
(Haha is a genius.)

1998
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:02,257
I wanted to take a selfie with him, but he ran away.

1999
01:08:03,028 --> 01:08:05,098
There must be a reason he ran away.

2000
01:08:05,098 --> 01:08:06,228
(There has to be a reason.)

2001
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:09,367
(That means...)

2002
01:08:09,367 --> 01:08:12,898
(Is Hyo Seop a ghost?)

2003
01:08:13,568 --> 01:08:16,867
(Hyo Seop is...)

2004
01:08:16,867 --> 01:08:21,077
(a ghost!)

2005
01:08:22,707 --> 01:08:23,978
This is so difficult.

2006
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:27,047
(He's a ghost.)

2007
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:28,547
You're sweating a lot.

2008
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:30,287
(He was sweating profusely.)

2009
01:08:31,287 --> 01:08:32,287
It's getting worse.

2010
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:33,287
Then are there 3 ghosts? Or 4?

2011
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:34,757
(He's confused from the beginning.)

2012
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:36,528
- How do you know there are three? - How do you know that?

2013
01:08:36,787 --> 01:08:39,558
(He's bad at lying.)

2014
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:42,428
(He made staff anxious.)

2015
01:08:42,428 --> 01:08:47,608
(The third ghost is Hyo Seop.)

2016
01:08:47,608 --> 01:08:48,768
Where are you going?

2017
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:52,638
(I have to get away.)

2018
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:55,608
It has to be Hyo Seop.

2019
01:08:55,608 --> 01:08:56,948
I know. I agree.

2020
01:08:56,948 --> 01:08:58,047
- He's the youngest. - I agree.

2021
01:08:58,148 --> 01:08:59,448
It's Hyo Seop.

2022
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:01,247
(They have to find the weapons fast.)

2023
01:09:01,247 --> 01:09:03,547
Can I rip the name tags any time?

2024
01:09:03,547 --> 01:09:05,717
(He reveals his true colors.)

2025
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:07,117
There's no way.

2026
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,428
We have to run away.

2027
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:10,797
(Will they find the weapons first or get their name tags ripped?)

2028
01:09:10,797 --> 01:09:11,997
There's Seok Jin.

2029
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:14,898
(He finds Seok Jin on the other side.)

2030
01:09:14,898 --> 01:09:15,997
There's Seok Jin.

2031
01:09:15,997 --> 01:09:19,098
(Hyo Seop is a ghost, and he's happy to see Seok Jin.)

2032
01:09:20,167 --> 01:09:24,007
(Seok Jin was a strong candidate for a ghost from the start.)

2033
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:25,138
He's done.

2034
01:09:25,138 --> 01:09:30,577
(The more hints got discovered, the more they become certain.)

2035
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,217
(There's something going on between them.)

2036
01:09:33,217 --> 01:09:34,247
Did you find anything?

2037
01:09:34,247 --> 01:09:35,888
- I didn't. - Really?

2038
01:09:35,948 --> 01:09:37,018
Did you find anything?

2039
01:09:37,018 --> 01:09:38,117
Not yet.

2040
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:40,957
Let's share information.

2041
01:09:41,787 --> 01:09:44,127
- I'll share it. - Okay.

2042
01:09:44,127 --> 01:09:45,698
(They share the hints in order to eradicate the ghosts.)

2043
01:09:46,598 --> 01:09:48,028
- He's in his 40s. - The 1st ghost is in his 40s.

2044
01:09:48,028 --> 01:09:50,198
(This is a crucial hint Jong Kook earned earlier.)

2045
01:09:51,698 --> 01:09:53,898
(Among those who debuted over 20 years ago...)

2046
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:56,068
- It has to be you or Jae Seok. - I know.

2047
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:59,207
He's a ghost. I think he's a ghost.

2048
01:09:59,877 --> 01:10:00,978
Earlier...

2049
01:10:00,978 --> 01:10:02,007
(Ghost and human meets.)

2050
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:03,407
How do I explain this?

2051
01:10:04,018 --> 01:10:05,848
At this point,

2052
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:06,948
I'll just rip your name tag.

2053
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:08,117
(His attitude has changed.)

2054
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:09,188
I'll rip your name tag.

2055
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,318
(The ghost starts hunting for humans.)

2056
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:13,287
At this point, I'll just rip your name tag.

2057
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,558
- Me? - Yes.

2058
01:10:16,728 --> 01:10:17,797
(He sprints like a flash of lightning.)

2059
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:18,827
Hey.

2060
01:10:18,827 --> 01:10:22,568
(Human Jee Seok Jin is out.)

2061
01:10:23,627 --> 01:10:24,867
(He was helpless.)

2062
01:10:24,867 --> 01:10:25,967
See?

2063
01:10:25,967 --> 01:10:28,367
(He was helpless.)

2064
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:32,138
Human Jee Seok Jin is out.

2065
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:35,108
Human Jee Seok Jin is out.

2066
01:10:35,577 --> 01:10:36,577
Already?

2067
01:10:36,577 --> 01:10:37,577
(That was faster than expected.)

2068
01:10:37,917 --> 01:10:39,348
He was with me a few moments ago.

2069
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,848
(Hyo Seop is showing his true colors.)

2070
01:10:41,848 --> 01:10:42,917
Did Hyo Seop get him out?

2071
01:10:43,087 --> 01:10:44,217
- He did. - Was it him?

2072
01:10:46,257 --> 01:10:51,228
(It's me. Which humans should I eliminate now?)

2073
01:10:51,452 --> 01:10:55,452
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E424 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"The Nightmare of Halloween"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

2074
01:10:55,728 --> 01:10:56,867
It's Hyo Seop.

2075
01:10:56,867 --> 01:10:59,667
(Hyo Seop was looking for a prey. Haha spots him.)

2076
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:04,978
I need an item to eliminate the ghosts.

2077
01:11:05,738 --> 01:11:11,348
(They must find these items to eliminate the ghosts.)

2078
01:11:11,617 --> 01:11:13,617
(At that moment!)

2079
01:11:16,148 --> 01:11:17,247
I found it.

2080
01:11:18,018 --> 01:11:19,188
"Ghosts are not allowed to have this."

2081
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:20,217
(She's found a weapon box.)

2082
01:11:20,217 --> 01:11:21,327
What's this?

2083
01:11:22,787 --> 01:11:24,497
What's this? Is it a garlic necklace?

2084
01:11:24,497 --> 01:11:25,797
(She finds a garlic necklace.)

2085
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:28,528
"This is a weapon to eliminate the vampire."

2086
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:31,797
"The vampire is out once you put the necklace around their neck."

2087
01:11:31,797 --> 01:11:32,867
(Is the vampire...)

2088
01:11:32,867 --> 01:11:36,438
(Hyo Seop?)

2089
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:39,077
- Haha, I found it. - Did you?

2090
01:11:39,138 --> 01:11:40,747
- What is it? - Where's Hyo Seop?

2091
01:11:40,747 --> 01:11:43,077
- Hyo Seop's head? - I have to put this around him.

2092
01:11:43,207 --> 01:11:44,778
- He's there. - Where?

2093
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:46,148
There.

2094
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:47,217
- Hyo Seop. - Come.

2095
01:11:47,217 --> 01:11:49,917
(They start chasing him.)

2096
01:11:49,917 --> 01:11:53,117
(They arrive on the 3rd floor where Hyo Seop was earlier.)

2097
01:11:53,117 --> 01:11:54,358
He's gone, Ji Hyo.

2098
01:11:55,058 --> 01:11:56,428
He's gone, Haha.

2099
01:11:56,888 --> 01:11:58,858
I think he's in hiding.

2100
01:11:58,858 --> 01:12:01,797
(He couldn't have gone far. Let's look nearby.)

2101
01:12:05,438 --> 01:12:07,537
(Vampire Hyo Seop is here!)

2102
01:12:07,537 --> 01:12:08,568
(Let's rip Haha's name tag.)

2103
01:12:08,568 --> 01:12:09,738
Hey, get him.

2104
01:12:09,837 --> 01:12:11,537
(Take this garlic necklace!)

2105
01:12:11,537 --> 01:12:13,037
- Get him. - What's this?

2106
01:12:13,707 --> 01:12:14,808
(They start chasing him with the garlic necklace.)

2107
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:15,948
What's this?

2108
01:12:15,948 --> 01:12:17,007
Get him!

2109
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,278
Be careful.

2110
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:22,587
You scared me.

2111
01:12:22,617 --> 01:12:23,747
- Catch him. - Catch him.

2112
01:12:23,747 --> 01:12:24,988
(Jong Kook was going up the stairs and joins the chase.)

2113
01:12:24,988 --> 01:12:26,757
- Hey, here he is. - Catch him.

2114
01:12:26,858 --> 01:12:28,988
Hyo Seop is here. He's here.

2115
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:30,858
He's here. Come in.

2116
01:12:30,858 --> 01:12:32,157
Hold on.

2117
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:33,558
- He's here. - Catch him.

2118
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:34,627
Let me go once.

2119
01:12:34,627 --> 01:12:36,268
- Catch him. - We got you.

2120
01:12:36,367 --> 01:12:38,198
You're too guilty, so I can't help you.

2121
01:12:38,367 --> 01:12:39,667
- Let's go. - Take him.

2122
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:42,268
- I was shocked. - Go, Hyo Seop.

2123
01:12:42,268 --> 01:12:45,077
(He got Seok Jin out and went away in vain.)

2124
01:12:45,678 --> 01:12:47,907
Ghost Ahn Hyo Seop is out.

2125
01:12:47,907 --> 01:12:51,577
(Third ghost Hyo Seop is out.)

2126
01:12:53,377 --> 01:12:56,917
(Hyo Seop is out,)

2127
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:00,117
(but the candidates for the first ghost are both here.)

2128
01:13:00,117 --> 01:13:01,327
Goodness.

2129
01:13:01,858 --> 01:13:03,957
Look at him.

2130
01:13:03,957 --> 01:13:04,957
Oh, gosh.

2131
01:13:04,957 --> 01:13:06,428
One of them is a ghost.

2132
01:13:06,827 --> 01:13:08,627
- It's one of them. - This is driving me nuts.

2133
01:13:08,797 --> 01:13:11,337
Jae Seok was at the entrance.

2134
01:13:11,568 --> 01:13:12,698
He could have caught him.

2135
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:14,638
He could have easily caught him.

2136
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:16,867
But he let go,

2137
01:13:16,867 --> 01:13:18,377
and then he went in.

2138
01:13:18,738 --> 01:13:20,678
- Be truthful. - He didn't touch him.

2139
01:13:20,678 --> 01:13:22,348
(Stop setting me up.)

2140
01:13:22,348 --> 01:13:24,547
I was going to catch Hyo Seop, but Jong Kook was behind me.

2141
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:25,877
You know how he looks at you?

2142
01:13:26,577 --> 01:13:28,117
I didn't know you guys were behind him.

2143
01:13:28,388 --> 01:13:30,287
I thought I was going to get eliminated.

2144
01:13:30,388 --> 01:13:31,787
You guys came, so he got eliminated.

2145
01:13:32,318 --> 01:13:34,587
(Who's telling the truth?)

2146
01:13:34,587 --> 01:13:36,558
It's a tie...

2147
01:13:36,728 --> 01:13:39,728
because it's gimbap versus duck.

2148
01:13:39,728 --> 01:13:40,898
(Duck, gimbap)

2149
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:43,598
- It's him. Look. - It's gimbap versus duck.

2150
01:13:43,598 --> 01:13:45,098
I usually eat gimbap.

2151
01:13:45,098 --> 01:13:46,537
(They were both bad at the previous race.)

2152
01:13:46,537 --> 01:13:48,438
I'll leave it for now.

2153
01:13:48,438 --> 01:13:50,138
I'm going to find it. You just wait.

2154
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:51,337
Come back for a second, Jae Seok.

2155
01:13:51,438 --> 01:13:52,577
I'll find it and come back.

2156
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:56,778
It's not me. I'm really nothing today.

2157
01:13:56,778 --> 01:13:59,247
This is so unfair. I got covered in flour...

2158
01:13:59,917 --> 01:14:01,318
and got soaked.

2159
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:04,018
They even made fun of me because my face was blushing.

2160
01:14:04,318 --> 01:14:05,888
Nothing is working out.

2161
01:14:05,888 --> 01:14:07,587
(Sighing)

2162
01:14:11,358 --> 01:14:13,698
I found a weapon!

2163
01:14:13,698 --> 01:14:15,327
I found a weapon. This is awesome.

2164
01:14:15,398 --> 01:14:16,768
This is it.

2165
01:14:16,768 --> 01:14:18,167
(What weapon did she find dramatically?)

2166
01:14:18,438 --> 01:14:21,707
(What? A tray?)

2167
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:24,577
(She was running away earlier, and she creates her own weapon now.)

2168
01:14:24,577 --> 01:14:25,907
I have to escape somehow.

2169
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:27,407
Is there nothing else?

2170
01:14:27,407 --> 01:14:28,707
Is this a weapon?

2171
01:14:29,448 --> 01:14:31,648
(Who was behind her?)

2172
01:14:31,648 --> 01:14:33,077
Hey!

2173
01:14:33,077 --> 01:14:34,547
Kwang Soo!

2174
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:37,087
Come here! There's a ghost!

2175
01:14:37,247 --> 01:14:38,318
The ghost...

2176
01:14:40,318 --> 01:14:41,488
What is it?

2177
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:43,157
What is it?

2178
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:46,198
(Ripping)

2179
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:50,098
Are you out?

2180
01:14:50,098 --> 01:14:51,367
(Did she get eliminated by a mysterious ghost?)

2181
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:52,398
Who ripped your name tag?

2182
01:14:54,207 --> 01:14:56,308
Hold on. Hold on!

2183
01:14:56,308 --> 01:14:58,778
(This ghost attacked Kwang Soo before he had a chance to breathe.)

2184
01:14:58,778 --> 01:15:00,678
Se Chan!

2185
01:15:01,178 --> 01:15:03,148
What's going on?

2186
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:04,417
(What's going on with Kwang Soo?)

2187
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,287
(Kwang Soo is terrified. What happened?)

2188
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,058
(Is Kwang Soo also out?)

2189
01:15:11,058 --> 01:15:12,188
Are you out?

2190
01:15:12,188 --> 01:15:14,188
(Did something happen? He can't speak.)

2191
01:15:14,188 --> 01:15:15,358
Why?

2192
01:15:15,358 --> 01:15:19,827
(So Min and Kwang Soo are out in an instant.)

2193
01:15:20,457 --> 01:15:22,627
(Ghost status, third ghost is out.)

2194
01:15:22,627 --> 01:15:25,537
(Human Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and So Min are out.)

2195
01:15:25,638 --> 01:15:27,037
"Human Jeon So Min is out?"

2196
01:15:27,037 --> 01:15:28,707
Human Jeon So Min is out.

2197
01:15:29,037 --> 01:15:30,938
(There are fewer humans remaining, and they don't have a clue.)

2198
01:15:30,938 --> 01:15:32,478
- Who? - I'm more confused now.

2199
01:15:34,178 --> 01:15:37,978
(Why is Na Eun so relaxed in this situation?)

2200
01:15:38,278 --> 01:15:39,318
Na Eun...

2201
01:15:39,318 --> 01:15:40,417
(Why is she so relaxed?)

2202
01:15:40,417 --> 01:15:42,747
Na Eun is a little bit strange too.

2203
01:15:43,848 --> 01:15:47,558
(Jong Kook, candidate for the first ghost, appears.)

2204
01:15:47,558 --> 01:15:48,728
Look at Jong Kook.

2205
01:15:49,028 --> 01:15:50,058
Jong Kook.

2206
01:15:51,327 --> 01:15:52,558
Look at him.

2207
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:55,827
You're just unbelieveable. What did you say?

2208
01:15:55,827 --> 01:15:57,297
- Are you playing dumb? - Goodness.

2209
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:59,037
Are you pretending like you're not a ghost?

2210
01:15:59,438 --> 01:16:01,337
- I'm frightened. - Oh, gosh.

2211
01:16:01,568 --> 01:16:04,007
- Hey. - Look at him.

2212
01:16:04,507 --> 01:16:05,537
For goodness' sake.

2213
01:16:05,537 --> 01:16:07,448
No wonder...

2214
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:09,047
you teased me so much today.

2215
01:16:09,047 --> 01:16:10,348
"No wonder"?

2216
01:16:10,348 --> 01:16:11,717
- You were. - Hey.

2217
01:16:11,717 --> 01:16:14,018
- Fine. - You shouldn't play that way.

2218
01:16:14,018 --> 01:16:15,217
I'm going to eliminate you.

2219
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:16,648
Give me a second.

2220
01:16:17,217 --> 01:16:19,988
This is insane. We're the only ones left.

2221
01:16:19,988 --> 01:16:21,127
(You should watch it, Jae Seok.)

2222
01:16:21,888 --> 01:16:23,428
I... Gosh.

2223
01:16:23,657 --> 01:16:25,327
I really want to eliminate him,

2224
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:27,367
but I can't right now.

2225
01:16:30,638 --> 01:16:32,138
(Why is Na Eun here?)

2226
01:16:32,138 --> 01:16:33,268
Na Eun...

2227
01:16:34,138 --> 01:16:35,308
(She's very awkward.)

2228
01:16:35,308 --> 01:16:36,608
I was looking for a hint.

2229
01:16:37,068 --> 01:16:38,738
(Really? Were you looking for a hint?)

2230
01:16:38,738 --> 01:16:39,808
A hint?

2231
01:16:39,978 --> 01:16:43,077
(Where did Young Hee come from?)

2232
01:16:43,877 --> 01:16:45,047
Were you looking for a hint?

2233
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:46,848
(This is spooky.)

2234
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:48,287
Why? I'm scared.

2235
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:51,787
(Who are these two people?)

2236
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:53,757
(They leave together.)

2237
01:16:53,757 --> 01:16:54,928
Where are you heading?

2238
01:16:54,928 --> 01:16:57,028
(They leave together.)

2239
01:16:57,257 --> 01:16:58,928
I think the two of them are ghosts.

2240
01:16:59,528 --> 01:17:01,167
Aren't they ghosts?

2241
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:04,967
(Are Jae Seok and Young Hee the 1st and 2nd ghosts?)

2242
01:17:05,438 --> 01:17:06,497
Look at that.

2243
01:17:06,568 --> 01:17:08,638
They are talking as they walk.

2244
01:17:10,407 --> 01:17:12,377
(They enter an empty room.)

2245
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:14,547
- Gosh, it smells good. - What a nice place!

2246
01:17:14,778 --> 01:17:15,948
- Doesn't it smell nice? - It smells good.

2247
01:17:15,948 --> 01:17:17,978
Let's enjoy the fragrance.

2248
01:17:17,978 --> 01:17:19,217
(Are they having a secret meeting between the ghosts?)

2249
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,478
It smells good in this room.

2250
01:17:25,917 --> 01:17:28,157
(Jae Seok's name tag...)

2251
01:17:28,157 --> 01:17:31,728
(gets ripped off by Young Hee.)

2252
01:17:31,728 --> 01:17:34,867
(She collects the name tag quietly like a real ghost.)

2253
01:17:34,867 --> 01:17:36,127
I thought Na Eun was a ghost!

2254
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,898
(Human Yu Jae Seok is out.)

2255
01:17:37,898 --> 01:17:41,568
(That means...)

2256
01:17:41,568 --> 01:17:45,808
(Yeong Hee is the second ghost.)

2257
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,978
(Humans, just you wait.)

2258
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:50,377
Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo!

2259
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:52,547
It's Seo Young Hee! Seo Young Hee!

2260
01:17:54,518 --> 01:17:55,917
(She collects name tags with a serene facial expression.)

2261
01:17:55,917 --> 01:17:57,148
My goodness.

2262
01:17:59,018 --> 01:18:00,457
Hello.

2263
01:18:00,928 --> 01:18:02,257
(If Young Hee is the second ghost,)

2264
01:18:02,257 --> 01:18:03,757
(that means the first ghost is...)

2265
01:18:03,757 --> 01:18:05,957
Hello. Gosh, it's nice to meet you.

2266
01:18:05,957 --> 01:18:08,098
(Kim Jong Kook.)

2267
01:18:09,827 --> 01:18:11,967
Hello. Gosh, it's nice to meet you.

2268
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,867
(That's how the 3 ghost siblings came to be.)

2269
01:18:16,808 --> 01:18:18,308
(When Kwang Soo was surprised to see Young Hee take So Min out,)

2270
01:18:18,308 --> 01:18:20,178
Hold on! Hold on!

2271
01:18:20,178 --> 01:18:22,047
(Jong Kook attacked him.)

2272
01:18:22,907 --> 01:18:24,217
Let's hurry up and go.

2273
01:18:24,518 --> 01:18:25,948
(The perfect collaboration of the 1st and 2nd ghosts.)

2274
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:27,318
Hurry up.

2275
01:18:27,488 --> 01:18:29,388
(When he met Jae Seok,)

2276
01:18:29,388 --> 01:18:31,217
(he stuck his tongue out.)

2277
01:18:31,757 --> 01:18:34,327
Gosh, is anyone else seeing this?

2278
01:18:34,327 --> 01:18:35,757
You are unbelievable.

2279
01:18:36,688 --> 01:18:38,698
Is anyone else seeing this? Hey!

2280
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:40,728
- You are unbelievable. - Am I the only one?

2281
01:18:40,728 --> 01:18:43,967
Jae Seok, you drive me crazy.

2282
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:51,108
Human Yu Jae Seok is out.

2283
01:18:51,738 --> 01:18:53,037
Is Jae Seok out?

2284
01:18:53,037 --> 01:18:54,907
Hold on. Is Jae Seok out?

2285
01:18:55,077 --> 01:18:56,707
Who ripped off his name tag?

2286
01:18:57,478 --> 01:18:59,678
Now, everyone will know that I am a ghost.

2287
01:19:01,818 --> 01:19:04,457
(Then they must rip off everyone's name tag with speed.)

2288
01:19:04,457 --> 01:19:06,657
- Se Chan. - Gosh, you startled me.

2289
01:19:06,757 --> 01:19:08,058
What's going on?

2290
01:19:08,058 --> 01:19:09,657
Is it you? Hold on.

2291
01:19:10,087 --> 01:19:11,898
Hold on. I got it.

2292
01:19:11,898 --> 01:19:13,558
What are you going to do?

2293
01:19:13,558 --> 01:19:15,127
Are you going to rip off my name tag?

2294
01:19:15,127 --> 01:19:16,367
Stay still.

2295
01:19:17,997 --> 01:19:19,438
- Se Chan. - Is he a ghost?

2296
01:19:19,438 --> 01:19:20,967
(Human Yang Se Chan is out.)

2297
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:24,478
(Young Hee eliminates Ji Hyo.)

2298
01:19:25,978 --> 01:19:27,007
(I see that it was her.)

2299
01:19:27,007 --> 01:19:29,007
I am sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

2300
01:19:29,007 --> 01:19:30,077
(With Young Hee's bright smile, Ji Hyo is out.)

2301
01:19:30,077 --> 01:19:31,518
You are the worst!

2302
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:35,448
Human Song Ji Hyo is out.

2303
01:19:35,448 --> 01:19:37,657
Human Song Ji Hyo is out.

2304
01:19:37,657 --> 01:19:38,657
- What? - My goodness.

2305
01:19:38,657 --> 01:19:40,388
(Is Ji Hyo out as well?)

2306
01:19:40,388 --> 01:19:42,428
(I don't know who ripped off Ji Hyo's name tag.)

2307
01:19:42,428 --> 01:19:46,497
Earlier, I saw Young Hee with Jae Seok.

2308
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,698
(That means Young Hee eliminated both Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.)

2309
01:19:48,698 --> 01:19:50,568
Then the remaining humans are me and...

2310
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:51,797
You and I are the only ones left.

2311
01:19:52,398 --> 01:19:53,438
Really?

2312
01:19:53,438 --> 01:19:54,808
(Are we the only humans left?)

2313
01:19:54,808 --> 01:19:56,037
I got goosebumps.

2314
01:19:56,037 --> 01:19:58,407
(Does that mean we have to face Jong Kook and Young Hee?)

2315
01:19:58,638 --> 01:20:00,007
I want to pee.

2316
01:20:00,537 --> 01:20:04,448
(Thinking about it makes him want to pee.)

2317
01:20:06,717 --> 01:20:07,988
I got goosebumps.

2318
01:20:07,988 --> 01:20:09,188
I can't believe this.

2319
01:20:09,617 --> 01:20:10,917
We have to do this.

2320
01:20:11,388 --> 01:20:13,657
Do the two of us need to take out those ghosts?

2321
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:18,398
(Young Hee searches for the humans.)

2322
01:20:23,398 --> 01:20:26,698
(She's finally found them.)

2323
01:20:26,698 --> 01:20:29,638
(The two humans)

2324
01:20:32,738 --> 01:20:34,948
- What should we do? - It has to be here somewhere.

2325
01:20:35,278 --> 01:20:36,308
There is...

2326
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:37,648
no weapon here.

2327
01:20:37,648 --> 01:20:39,678
- I searched this place before. - It's a good place to hide it.

2328
01:20:39,678 --> 01:20:40,787
I know.

2329
01:20:40,787 --> 01:20:42,188
(We must find a weapon before the ghosts come.)

2330
01:20:42,787 --> 01:20:45,757
(Young Hee enters the hallway of the 2nd floor.)

2331
01:20:48,087 --> 01:20:53,228
(They focus on the search without knowing that.)

2332
01:20:55,768 --> 01:20:57,938
(Gasping)

2333
01:20:57,938 --> 01:20:58,967
Is a ghost here?

2334
01:21:00,608 --> 01:21:02,108
(He freezes for a second.)

2335
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,037
It's... It's a ghost.

2336
01:21:04,037 --> 01:21:06,138
(It's... It's a ghost.)

2337
01:21:07,577 --> 01:21:09,247
You scared me!

2338
01:21:09,377 --> 01:21:11,518
You scared me, Young Hee.

2339
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:15,818
Why are you so scary?

2340
01:21:15,818 --> 01:21:16,818
(Calm down, my heart.)

2341
01:21:18,417 --> 01:21:19,717
(Shall I begin the hunt?)

2342
01:21:19,717 --> 01:21:20,988
Did you find a weapon?

2343
01:21:20,988 --> 01:21:22,358
(Shall I begin the hunt?)

2344
01:21:22,488 --> 01:21:24,327
- This is driving me crazy. - What should we do?

2345
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:27,028
Run away while I hold Young Hee back.

2346
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:28,928
You will hold me back?

2347
01:21:28,928 --> 01:21:32,638
(Don't you dare.)

2348
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:33,837
Young Hee.

2349
01:21:34,207 --> 01:21:35,638
Are you a ghost?

2350
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,907
I am sorry. I am a bad woman.

2351
01:21:37,907 --> 01:21:39,837
You are really scary.

2352
01:21:39,837 --> 01:21:41,108
Don't say that.

2353
01:21:41,108 --> 01:21:42,547
(She approaches them with a serene facial expression.)

2354
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:43,678
She is so scary.

2355
01:21:43,678 --> 01:21:46,217
When you say, "Don't say that," you are really scary.

2356
01:21:46,377 --> 01:21:47,648
Where are you going?

2357
01:21:47,888 --> 01:21:49,047
I mean...

2358
01:21:49,047 --> 01:21:53,117
(I can't fight against two humans.)

2359
01:21:55,028 --> 01:21:58,698
(Wait for me. I promise I will find them soon.)

2360
01:22:00,428 --> 01:22:03,627
Na Eun, I will do what I can do.

2361
01:22:04,297 --> 01:22:06,167
Go and find a weapon.

2362
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,768
- Go. - Please survive...

2363
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,568
- so that we can meet again. - My name tag will get ripped off.

2364
01:22:10,707 --> 01:22:12,707
Go and find a weapon. Hurry up and go.

2365
01:22:13,778 --> 01:22:15,348
Hurry up and go.

2366
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:16,778
(Hurry up and go before Jong Kook comes.)

2367
01:22:16,778 --> 01:22:18,917
Na Eun, find a weapon quickly.

2368
01:22:19,178 --> 01:22:20,348
Go easy on me.

2369
01:22:21,518 --> 01:22:23,747
(Young Hee, go easy on me.)

2370
01:22:23,747 --> 01:22:26,257
- Don't say that. - I am really weak.

2371
01:22:26,257 --> 01:22:27,957
I have no strength.

2372
01:22:27,957 --> 01:22:30,757
(While Haha stalls for time,)

2373
01:22:30,757 --> 01:22:34,898
(Na Eun searches for a weapon.)

2374
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:37,297
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is searching for the humans.)

2375
01:22:37,297 --> 01:22:39,497
(Na Eun is searching for a weapon.)

2376
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:42,638
(Where is the second ghost?)

2377
01:22:42,638 --> 01:22:44,207
(A human that looks for a weapon...)

2378
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:46,678
(versus a ghost that looks for the group)

2379
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:48,148
Stay alive!

2380
01:22:48,148 --> 01:22:50,747
(The one who ends the search first is bound to have an upper hand.)

2381
01:22:51,148 --> 01:22:53,518
(I really need a weapon box.)

2382
01:22:57,757 --> 01:23:00,787
(She's finally found it.)

2383
01:23:01,757 --> 01:23:04,297
"This is a weapon that can eliminate a witch."

2384
01:23:04,457 --> 01:23:06,457
"The witch is out once you put the angel's headband on her hair."

2385
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,398
(Okay, I got it!)

2386
01:23:10,398 --> 01:23:11,497
(She must put the headband on her before Haha gets eliminated.)

2387
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:12,837
I need to rip off the name tag.

2388
01:23:12,898 --> 01:23:14,308
I need to rip off the name tag.

2389
01:23:15,467 --> 01:23:17,308
Come on.

2390
01:23:17,308 --> 01:23:18,337
Did you find it?

2391
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:20,278
- What? - She found it!

2392
01:23:20,278 --> 01:23:21,577
- No way! - She found it!

2393
01:23:21,577 --> 01:23:22,678
(I can't believe it.)

2394
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:24,247
(They turn the tables.)

2395
01:23:24,247 --> 01:23:25,778
- No! - Come on.

2396
01:23:25,778 --> 01:23:27,648
(Na Eun needs to put the headband on her head.)

2397
01:23:27,888 --> 01:23:30,888
(The weapon is activated.)

2398
01:23:30,888 --> 01:23:32,157
We did it!

2399
01:23:32,157 --> 01:23:33,188
For goodness' sake.

2400
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:36,587
(The scary ghost, Seo Young Hee is out.)

2401
01:23:37,827 --> 01:23:39,297
Gosh, Na Eun.

2402
01:23:39,457 --> 01:23:41,028
For goodness' sake.

2403
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:42,928
A ghost!

2404
01:23:43,297 --> 01:23:45,997
Seo Young Hee is out. Seo Young Hee is out.

2405
01:23:47,837 --> 01:23:50,308
(Is Young Hee out?)

2406
01:23:50,308 --> 01:23:51,778
(Ghost Jong Kook versus Humans Haha and Na Eun)

2407
01:23:51,778 --> 01:23:53,037
This is driving me crazy.

2408
01:23:53,037 --> 01:23:55,148
- Na Eun. - We need to find a weapon.

2409
01:23:55,148 --> 01:23:56,278
Let's find a weapon.

2410
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:57,648
(Finding the weapon for Jong Kook is the only way they can live.)

2411
01:23:57,818 --> 01:24:00,617
(Where are the humans hiding?)

2412
01:24:01,648 --> 01:24:05,117
(They must find a weapon before Jong Kook catches them.)

2413
01:24:07,327 --> 01:24:08,488
Haha!

2414
01:24:08,488 --> 01:24:09,928
(Where are you hiding?)

2415
01:24:12,127 --> 01:24:14,867
(Is that Jong Kook's voice?)

2416
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:16,467
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

2417
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:17,837
What are you doing?

2418
01:24:17,837 --> 01:24:19,037
What?

2419
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:20,738
Who's left?

2420
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:22,268
(Does he not know that I am a ghost?)

2421
01:24:22,268 --> 01:24:25,938
You, I...

2422
01:24:25,938 --> 01:24:27,877
Are you a ghost?

2423
01:24:27,877 --> 01:24:28,948
What?

2424
01:24:30,047 --> 01:24:31,518
I am not a ghost, Haha.

2425
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:33,117
How could you say that...

2426
01:24:33,877 --> 01:24:36,348
when we are the only men left?

2427
01:24:36,348 --> 01:24:38,117
(Don't lie to me.)

2428
01:24:38,117 --> 01:24:39,558
(He knows everything.)

2429
01:24:39,558 --> 01:24:40,728
Haha.

2430
01:24:41,358 --> 01:24:43,558
Since I am not a ghost,

2431
01:24:43,558 --> 01:24:45,058
you must be a ghost.

2432
01:24:45,398 --> 01:24:47,997
Stay right there.

2433
01:24:47,997 --> 01:24:49,497
Okay, Haha?

2434
01:24:50,997 --> 01:24:53,797
(Stay right there.)

2435
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,837
(I will go to you.)

2436
01:24:55,837 --> 01:24:57,707
No! Please!

2437
01:24:57,707 --> 01:24:58,877
(Don't let your guards down.)

2438
01:24:58,877 --> 01:25:02,448
(Ghost Jong Kook is coming to get a human.)

2439
01:25:03,247 --> 01:25:05,478
(Haha hides in a room.)

2440
01:25:06,077 --> 01:25:09,818
(I see that I got you.)

2441
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:11,287
(Haha is trapped.)

2442
01:25:11,287 --> 01:25:12,358
Haha.

2443
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:14,688
Hold on, Jong Kook. I am sorry.

2444
01:25:14,757 --> 01:25:17,457
Why are you acting this way?

2445
01:25:17,457 --> 01:25:19,297
- For how long do you plan to stay? - I am sorry.

2446
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:20,928
(For how long do you plan to stay?)

2447
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:24,037
Don't do this. Why are you acting this way?

2448
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:25,497
I trusted you.

2449
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,438
I trusted you. I swear.

2450
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:29,037
- Haha. - How could you do this to me?

2451
01:25:29,438 --> 01:25:30,638
Are you a ghost?

2452
01:25:30,638 --> 01:25:33,507
(Is that Na Eun behind Jong Kook?)

2453
01:25:33,507 --> 01:25:35,747
(A weapon is activated.)

2454
01:25:36,948 --> 01:25:38,077
What is this?

2455
01:25:38,077 --> 01:25:39,178
(She got me.)

2456
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:42,848
(I am glad I didn't pee my pants.)

2457
01:25:43,217 --> 01:25:45,617
(This is how it happened.)

2458
01:25:46,257 --> 01:25:48,928
What does a weapon box look like? I haven't seen one.

2459
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,228
(Haha and Na Eun search here and there.)

2460
01:25:52,858 --> 01:25:54,198
Isn't this a weapon?

2461
01:25:54,398 --> 01:25:56,198
(She's found a weapon.)

2462
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:57,198
What is that?

2463
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,037
A full moon is related to the werewolf.

2464
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:02,207
- Right? That's Jong Kook. - That's Jong Kook.

2465
01:26:03,667 --> 01:26:04,707
(Let's hide.)

2466
01:26:04,707 --> 01:26:06,238
Go inside.

2467
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:08,377
I will pretend...

2468
01:26:08,547 --> 01:26:10,747
to hide in this room.

2469
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:12,917
- You should stay here. - Here.

2470
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:14,488
Come inside.

2471
01:26:14,488 --> 01:26:15,648
Hurry up and come inside.

2472
01:26:16,988 --> 01:26:19,757
(When he ran into Jong Kook,)

2473
01:26:19,957 --> 01:26:22,827
(he lured him with his acting skills.)

2474
01:26:24,598 --> 01:26:26,327
(This is my chance.)

2475
01:26:27,497 --> 01:26:30,638
(Ghost Kim Jong Kook is out.)

2476
01:26:34,608 --> 01:26:35,768
(The race ends.)

2477
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:37,377
Let me announce the result of the race.

2478
01:26:37,707 --> 01:26:39,138
Team Humans won!

2479
01:26:39,138 --> 01:26:40,577
Yes!

2480
01:26:40,577 --> 01:26:41,848
You are the best.

2481
01:26:41,848 --> 01:26:43,108
My goodness.

2482
01:26:44,178 --> 01:26:45,278
It was so close.

2483
01:26:45,278 --> 01:26:47,518
The gold badge is back after a long while.

2484
01:26:47,518 --> 01:26:48,988
Gosh, this is my first time I've received it.

2485
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:51,087
(Shiny)

2486
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:52,358
What is this?

2487
01:26:52,388 --> 01:26:54,228
It lights up. Look, it lights up.

2488
01:26:54,228 --> 01:26:55,228
My goodness.

2489
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:56,728
(Good for you, humans.)

2490
01:26:56,728 --> 01:26:58,558
It happened so quickly.

2491
01:26:58,558 --> 01:26:59,558
(Getting jealous)

2492
01:26:59,558 --> 01:27:00,627
By the way...

2493
01:27:00,728 --> 01:27:02,627
- My goodness. - You should take it.

2494
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:03,928
- Thank you. - Take it as a souvenir.

2495
01:27:03,928 --> 01:27:05,898
- Generous members share prizes. - Right.

2496
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,808
- I'll give this to Hyo Seop. - Okay.

2497
01:27:09,037 --> 01:27:10,738
- This is for Hyo Seop. - Thank you.

2498
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:12,138
- Thank you. - It's for Hyo Seop.

2499
01:27:12,138 --> 01:27:13,278
Thank you.

2500
01:27:14,308 --> 01:27:16,348
Some will share, but some will take theirs.

2501
01:27:16,348 --> 01:27:18,717
(Do whatever you want.)

2502
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:20,518
(When it comes to gold, Seok Jin sticks to the principles.)

2503
01:27:20,518 --> 01:27:22,518
- That was scary. - I got goosebumps.

2504
01:27:22,547 --> 01:27:24,318
- I thought it was Na Eun. - Goodness.

2505
01:27:24,318 --> 01:27:25,917
I really thought it was Na Eun too.

2506
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:27,858
I felt so wronged.

2507
01:27:27,858 --> 01:27:29,127
Why did you try to stay with me?

2508
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:31,398
I was a human. I wanted to be with another human.

2509
01:27:31,398 --> 01:27:33,598
- You chose him since he's a human. - I see.

2510
01:27:33,598 --> 01:27:35,627
By the way, the frustrating part was that...

2511
01:27:35,627 --> 01:27:37,398
- Se Chan was just getting over her, - It's so frustrating.

2512
01:27:37,398 --> 01:27:39,037
but here's Na Eun again.

2513
01:27:39,037 --> 01:27:40,638
- This is driving me crazy. - Goodness.

2514
01:27:40,638 --> 01:27:43,768
- Get over her quickly. - Yes, that's not easy though.

2515
01:27:43,768 --> 01:27:46,178
- It was hard. I'm out of energy. - Forget about her now.

2516
01:27:46,678 --> 01:27:49,948
- Hyo Seop, it's all right. - Okay.

2517
01:27:49,948 --> 01:27:52,747
Yes, it's all right. You had a lot to carry on your own today.

2518
01:27:53,617 --> 01:27:55,848
Don't pretend you're nice. Remember how you were when you eliminated me?

2519
01:27:55,848 --> 01:27:57,518
You glared at me.

2520
01:27:57,587 --> 01:27:59,587
It wasn't a big deal anyway. I was just playing with him.

2521
01:27:59,587 --> 01:28:02,457
I was just teasing that he might be the ghost.

2522
01:28:02,627 --> 01:28:04,058
I told him that I was just kidding.

2523
01:28:04,398 --> 01:28:06,127
"At this point, I'll just rip your name tag."

2524
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:09,198
("At this point, I'll just rip your name tag.")

2525
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:12,238
Come on. What was that?

2526
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:13,967
Seriously? That really happened?

2527
01:28:13,967 --> 01:28:16,238
Hyo Seop came to me to remove my name tag.

2528
01:28:16,238 --> 01:28:17,337
I told him not to do it. What?

2529
01:28:17,337 --> 01:28:18,537
Go back to your spot.

2530
01:28:19,108 --> 01:28:20,507
- Sorry? - Go back to your spot.

2531
01:28:20,507 --> 01:28:22,448
(Go back to my spot?)

2532
01:28:22,448 --> 01:28:23,808
Move back.

2533
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:27,448
(The rules of conversations are strict only to Kwang Soo.)

2534
01:28:27,448 --> 01:28:29,087
- What are you doing to me? - Right now,

2535
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,547
we're talking here. Give us some space.

2536
01:28:30,547 --> 01:28:34,087
Let me say something too. I have a funny story, is all.

2537
01:28:34,228 --> 01:28:36,287
Do you have a funny story? Go ahead.

2538
01:28:36,928 --> 01:28:39,028
- Go on. - It won't be funny now.

2539
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:42,997
- No. - Can you tell us next week?

2540
01:28:42,997 --> 01:28:44,768
(The race ends without hearing the funny story.)

2541
01:28:46,837 --> 01:28:50,778
(A mysterious video letter from their father arrives.)

2542
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:55,577
(They have to find the food their father wants to have?)

2543
01:28:56,148 --> 01:28:57,148
(Pardon?)

2544
01:28:57,148 --> 01:28:58,148
(Food?)

2545
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:00,717
(Thus began the Search Party of Autumn Delicacy.)

2546
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:02,388
(They will gnaw,)

2547
01:29:02,388 --> 01:29:04,018
(chew,)

2548
01:29:04,018 --> 01:29:05,988
(taste, and enjoy the food.)

2549
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:07,488
(Of course,)

2550
01:29:07,488 --> 01:29:09,457
(everyone can't eat the food.)

2551
01:29:09,688 --> 01:29:11,228
(To find the food for their father,)

2552
01:29:11,228 --> 01:29:12,728
(they hold a battle of food.)

2553
01:29:12,928 --> 01:29:14,568
(This is quite a funny show.)

2554
01:29:15,068 --> 01:29:17,398
(However,)

2555
01:29:18,037 --> 01:29:21,407
(someone among them knows what the food they're looking for is?)

2556
01:29:21,837 --> 01:29:23,608
(Slowly, the secret of the family is unraveling.)

2557
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,108
(Some are trying to conceal the secret.)

2558
01:29:25,108 --> 01:29:27,037
(Some are trying to find out.)

2559
01:29:27,037 --> 01:29:29,507
(What's the secret of the food their father is looking for?)

2560
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,818
(Mom!)

2561
01:29:32,818 --> 01:29:34,717
(Is my mom alive?)

2562
01:29:34,717 --> 01:29:35,747
(I'm sorry, Mom.)

2563
01:29:35,747 --> 01:29:36,747
(I love you.)

2564
01:29:37,388 --> 01:29:38,917
(Dangerous Family)
