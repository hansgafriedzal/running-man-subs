1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,643
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:11,988
What is this place? I have never been here before.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,229
- It must be new. - Prehistoric Park.

4
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,776
It's a prehistoric person who is barbecuing a pig.

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,899
Seok Jin used to live here.

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,930
Seok Jin, say hello to them.

7
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,439
(Seok Jin, welcome home.)

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,522
Seok Jin, why did you wear clothes?

9
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:24,570
You used to wear animal hides.

10
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:26,227
- I used to wear animal hides. - That's right.

11
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:29,507
(The breakfast of a prehistoric celebrity)

12
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,450
Jae Seok, I don't know you anymore.

13
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:35,380
- What do you mean? - I don't know you anymore.

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,680
You are so frustrating.

15
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:38,750
- You are suspicious. - Jong Kook was strange,

16
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:40,119
- but Jae Seok was stranger. - He is strange.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,589
To be honest, you are more suspicious than Kwang Soo now.

18
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,860
- You drive me crazy. - You know what I am like.

19
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:47,299
When people suspect me, I get into the character.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,299
- But he... - Stop doing that.

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,460
- But he... - Stop doing that.

22
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,570
Stop doing that.

23
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,170
- Stop doing that. - He loves attention too much.

24
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,369
When he gets a solo shot,

25
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,640
he absorbs attention like a sponge.

26
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,661
(I can do anything for a solo shot.)

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,100
He zooms into himself.

28
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:04,745
It's called the Solo Shot Syndrome.

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,079
- When he gets a solo shot... - Isn't it incurable?

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,450
- Isn't it incurable? - It's incurable.

31
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,090
- Solo Shot Syndrome. - When he gets a solo shot,

32
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:13,049
- he feels like he needs to act. - That's right.

33
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,689
Thus, the majority of the posts on the website is...

34
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,230
- about me. - That's right.

35
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,500
I get a lot of malicious comments.

36
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:22,774
(He gets a lot of malicious comments.)

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,799
They say criticism lengthens life. You are practically immortal.

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,799
(He becomes immortal from too much criticism.)

39
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,170
- You are immortal. - He is immortal.

40
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,469
Not even Emperor Qin Shi Huang could achieve that feat.

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,179
- In the past, you got no comments. - "Stop talking." What?

42
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,130
- You got no comments. - I got, "Cheer up."

43
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:38,091
"Cheer up."

44
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,010
- "Good luck." - You cheered up too much.

45
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,750
That's right. I cheered up too much.

46
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:44,120
- He should have stopped himself. - It's an interest in me.

47
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:46,847
- It is. - I like the malicious comments.

48
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,240
What are we doing today?

49
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:51,489
- A video? - Is there a video?

50
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,500
(Is there a video that introduces today's race?)

51
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,682
- Is there a video? - Will we get a silhouette?

52
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,629
- Kwang Soo. - Where is this place?

53
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,900
(A mysterious place)

54
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,170
- What is this? - When was this taken?

55
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,870
- It's mysterious. - Who is that?

56
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,961
(A mysterious man)

57
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,370
(Who is this middle-aged man?)

58
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:07,640
- Isn't he Seok Jin? - Who is he?

59
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:09,599
- He has defined features. - Is he Lee Duk Hwa?

60
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,191
Is he Kim Byung Man?

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,209
He is Kim Byung Ok!

62
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,649
- He is Kim Byung Ok. - My goodness.

63
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,317
(A charismatic middle-aged man, Kim Byung Ok)

64
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:21,220
(Byung Ok, it's nice to meet you.)

65
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:22,690
- It's your dad. - Seriously.

66
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,130
- It's your dad. - I know.

67
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:25,171
(What is Byung Ok doing here?)

68
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,899
My lovely sons and daughters,

69
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,499
how have you been?

70
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,470
(My lovely sons and daughters, how have you been?)

71
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:34,057
- What? - He must be our dad.

72
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,839
- He is our dad. - Father.

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,209
I thought So Min resembled him a lot.

74
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,483
Because I had to roam the world for business,

75
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,579
I couldn't look after you.

76
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,309
That's right.

77
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,361
Seok Jin, you were a loser with a runny nose.

78
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,290
- That sounds like him. - Jae Seok,

79
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,281
you were the mischievous one.

80
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,732
Jong Kook, you were like the eldest since you didn't care about the age.

81
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:01,899
- He doesn't care about the age. - He doesn't care about the age.

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,445
- He doesn't care about the age. - That sounds like him.

83
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,757
Ji Hyo, you were always in a daze.

84
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,400
Haha, you worried a lot because you didn't grow taller.

85
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,270
Se Chan, you liked to make people laugh.

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,950
Kwang Soo, you made me worry because you lacked in every way.

87
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,980
(He remembers that Kwang Soo lacked in every way.)

88
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:23,049
- What? - So Min, you resembled me a lot.

89
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,390
- That's right. - She does resemble him.

90
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:28,290
I am very proud...

91
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,180
that everyone grew up well.

92
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,829
- Mother struggled a lot. - He is our dad.

93
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,679
- We are a family today. - He is our dad.

94
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:40,499
There is a reason why I made you gather around today.

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,510
What is that?

96
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:46,457
When I was little, my late mother always made me...

97
00:03:46,471 --> 00:03:49,168
a certain dish in autumn.

98
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,268
- Mom passed away. - His mom passed away.

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,422
Mom!

100
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,579
(Why is he acting that way?)

101
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,649
Our grandma passed away.

102
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,049
- Our grandma. - Our grandma?

103
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,950
- He is talking about our grandma. - He suddenly went, "Mom!"

104
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:04,694
- Mom, I am sorry. Mom, I love you! - Our grandma.

105
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:05,959
Stay healthy.

106
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,071
(His mom is alive and well.)

107
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,999
When I was little, my late mother always made me...

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,767
a certain dish in autumn.

109
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,470
No matter how hard I try,

110
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:19,672
I can't remember what the dish is.

111
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,528
Do we need to find it for him?

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,280
Please find the food I am looking for...

113
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:31,020
by this evening.

114
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,860
(Please find the food I am looking for by this evening.)

115
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:34,932
Food?

116
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,231
What is it?

117
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:40,090
If you find it for me,

118
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:45,869
I will leave all of my fortune to you.

119
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,507
(Is this an opportunity to receive all of this fortune?)

120
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,500
If you don't find it,

121
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:57,179
you will receive a big punishment.

122
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,069
(You will receive a big punishment.)

123
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,749
What kind of a dad is he?

124
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,179
- I think he is nice. - It's ridiculous.

125
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,917
- Seriously. - What kind of a dad...

126
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:07,189
forces his children to be devoted?

127
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,312
It's not like he was interested in us before.

128
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,178
I will leave this game.

129
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:13,750
He is a rebel.

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,069
Dad doesn't seem to be much older than Seok Jin.

131
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,569
He had me when he was five.

132
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,270
(They look like brothers.)

133
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:24,009
- He had Seok Jin at a young age. - That's right.

134
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,637
You are five years apart from Dad.

135
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,110
You are five years apart from Dad.

136
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,580
That's right.

137
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,980
- They are like Haha and me. - Seok Jin was adopted.

138
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:36,183
Today, you will find the food of your dad's life.

139
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,889
The race is titled Go, Determined Gourmet.

140
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,020
Go, Determined Gourmet.

141
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,389
(Go, Determined Gourmet)

142
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,590
Every time you complete a mission, you will receive a hint.

143
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:46,129
You can check your answer at the restaurant...

144
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,699
that sells the dish.

145
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,852
The time limit is six hours.

146
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,799
If you bring the food before the sun sets,

147
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,670
you will inherit the fortune.

148
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,540
If you fail, you will receive a big punishment.

149
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,739
- Okay. - Okay.

150
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,760
The mission to receive the first hint is...

151
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:01,780
One-mind Family Portrait.

152
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,879
(One-mind Family Portrait)

153
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,921
One-mind?

154
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:07,439
Gosh, what is this?

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,368
It's a mission that requires unanimity.

156
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,389
You succeed...

157
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,694
if all the members take a photo with an identical item.

158
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,090
If you fail, the minority that chose a different item...

159
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,499
will receive a penalty from the majority.

160
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,030
What is this?

161
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,699
We are Running Man.

162
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,030
- We are Running Man. - Now,

163
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,639
please run to the hut.

164
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,499
- Don't walk, but run. Running Man! - Running Man!

165
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,911
(Each one of them takes a hut.)

166
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:35,821
My goodness.

167
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,379
It's impossible for eight people to choose the same thing.

168
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,480
The same item?

169
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,780
(The question is revealed after they enter the hut...)

170
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:43,790
What's the question?

171
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:44,850
(so that they don't plan ahead.)

172
00:06:44,851 --> 00:06:46,590
"Pick a wig and put it on."

173
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,611
(Pick a wig and put it on.)

174
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,989
(It's a success if everyone picks the same wig.)

175
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,830
This is driving me crazy.

176
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:53,841
(It's a success if everyone picks the same wig.)

177
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:57,129
We need to pick the same wig, right?

178
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,170
(They may succeed if they read the members' minds.)

179
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:00,928
This is a mission about having the one mind, right?

180
00:07:01,541 --> 00:07:03,590
This is... This is...

181
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,239
It has to be this wig. This wig suits Running Man.

182
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,949
(It suits a variety show.)

183
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,870
This wig suits Running Man.

184
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:15,280
This wig suits Running Man. There's nothing better.

185
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:17,068
Kwang Soo and I wore it.

186
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,502
I made up my mind as soon as you took out the wigs.

187
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,689
It's my favorite item.

188
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,129
(It's my favorite item.)

189
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,332
I wear it often. It's a bald wig.

190
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,058
Comedians would go with this one.

191
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:35,833
(I need to wear it for more screen time.)

192
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:40,524
I wore something similar last week. I feel like something is missing...

193
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,122
without a bald wig.

194
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,279
Okay. I think everyone will choose this wig.

195
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,400
(The male members choose the same wig.)

196
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,520
This is the one.

197
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:49,935
Hold on a second.

198
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,319
I think Ji Hyo will choose the pink wig.

199
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,660
(What if they want to look pretty?)

200
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,883
I think So Min will choose a red wig.

201
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,848
Given other members' preferences,

202
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,150
it's likely that they will choose a funny sig.

203
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,129
These two are funny.

204
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,211
(Is it Young Gu's wig or the bald one?)

205
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,830
I saw Ji Hyo wearing this wig a lot.

206
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,619
(What should I do? Ji Hyo seems to like Young Gu's wig.)

207
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,009
So Min dressed up as Chucky a while ago. Should I go with this?

208
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,637
(Will Ji Hyo choose an unexpected wig?)

209
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,210
(If Ji Hyo and So Min choose the right one, it'll end.)

210
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:19,610
We wore this wig a lot on Running Man.

211
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,720
Should I put on this one?

212
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,134
(Will they be able to choose the same wig as the other members?)

213
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,650
I'll count to five.

214
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,119
5, 4...

215
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,463
Everyone might choose the same wig.

216
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,508
- Three. - We all might get the right wig.

217
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,389
- 2, 1. - This one stood out right away!

218
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,289
Come on out. One. Come on out.

219
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,800
(What's the wig that they all chose?)

220
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:34,942
- That's right! - Hey!

221
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:38,230
- That's right. - Yes, this is the one.

222
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,615
- This is the wig. - This is it.

223
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,286
- That's right. - Yes!

224
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,539
- That's it. - Hey!

225
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,810
(All the male members chose the same wig.)

226
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,970
(Now, it all depends on So Min and Ji Hyo.)

227
00:08:45,971 --> 00:08:47,139
Hey, we all chose the same one!

228
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,480
(Now, it all depends on So Min and Ji Hyo.)

229
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,733
(Which wig did So Min choose?)

230
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,050
I knew it!

231
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:53,749
(7 members including So Min chose the same wig.)

232
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,629
(Now, only Ji Hyo's choice remains. Will they succeed on the first try?)

233
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,090
(No way. Ji Hyo is the only one who chose a red wig.)

234
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:03,930
(Due to Ji Hyo, the 1st round is a failure.)

235
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,989
- Hey, it's this wig. - My goodness.

236
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,029
- You wanted to look pretty. - You wanted to be the pretty one.

237
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,980
(Our looks are important too.)

238
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,070
- No, no. Seriously. Listen. - Come on, this one was obvious.

239
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,639
- Hey, this is the wig. - No, watch my clips later.

240
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,923
I was thinking of putting that on even until the last moment.

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,555
- My goodness. - I can't believe this.

242
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:19,426
- Seriously. - This is our show's signature wig.

243
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:21,658
- This is our signature wig. - Come on.

244
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,009
- Goodness. - She's unbelievable.

245
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,223
- Listen. In there... - Ji Hyo.

246
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,409
- Why did you choose that one? - I was torn between that and this.

247
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,390
- I'm serious. I held it to the end. - It could've ended right away.

248
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,350
By the way, when everyone was walking out,

249
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:33,860
everyone's forehead was shining.

250
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:34,960
- I'm telling you. - It was shining.

251
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:36,360
- When I was coming out in this wig, - By the way...

252
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,789
- I almost cried. I'm serious. - Everyone chose this.

253
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,275
I choked up for a second.

254
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,830
It was the most touching moment after the World Cup.

255
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,169
Seriously.

256
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,200
But as for Jong Kook,

257
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,917
- he looks scary with just this wig. - Hey.

258
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,869
- I look like Predator. - Why does he look so scary?

259
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,234
(He wanted to be funny, but he looks like he's about to invade Earth.)

260
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,539
- Goodness, we were so close. - Right.

261
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,611
- I bet the staff was surprised too. - Hey, by the way...

262
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,231
(Are those markers?)

263
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,377
(The marker makeup is the penalty for failing the mission.)

264
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,513
(Seok Jin, the makeup artist, starts off the makeup.)

265
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,029
(A few strokes of the marker...)

266
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,374
This is Se Chan's makeup.

267
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,844
I'll just do this.

268
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:17,230
- Gosh. - But the makeup looks nice on you.

269
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:18,300
You know what?

270
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,930
Ji Hyo humbly accepts the makeup, right?

271
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,516
- She has no choice. - She's the only one.

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,570
- Seriously. - Hey.

273
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:26,470
- I was holding it until the end. - I can't do it.

274
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:27,840
- We'll start the second round. - Okay.

275
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,879
- Please go back to your own hut. - So this is how the game is played.

276
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,350
- Okay. - I got it. I know how to play it.

277
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,522
We'll succeed this time.

278
00:10:32,811 --> 00:10:36,284
We must be able to put ourselves in each other's shoes.

279
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,541
Think about the whole group, not just the individual.

280
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,519
Gosh, that was so close.

281
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,159
(Which choice will be unanimous this time?)

282
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,757
(There are various funny glasses.)

283
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,059
(They must choose the same pair among three to succeed.)

284
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,516
This time, we'll definitely succeed.

285
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,340
(He grabs a pair without thinking about it.)

286
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:55,369
It's definitely this one.

287
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,139
(On Running Man, it's the glasses with the big nose.)

288
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,382
We'll succeed this time.

289
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Two of our members have big noses.

290
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:03,600
Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

291
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,730
We always joked about it.

292
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:07,660
It's...

293
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,350
this pair of glasses with the big nose.

294
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:11,735
(It's the pair of glasses with the big nose.)

295
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:13,104
I look just like Jae Seok.

296
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,211
This is my signature pair of glasses.

297
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,745
The glasses with the big nose.

298
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,807
I'm 100 percent sure we'll get this one.

299
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,360
But I'm not sure.

300
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:23,118
Seok Jin is getting greedy with close-up shots.

301
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,955
He might think about this from the staff's point of view.

302
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:27,586
He might wear this one.

303
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,340
(Bingo!)

304
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:35,017
(How come his behavior is always so predictable?)

305
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,166
(The close-up shot is all mine!)

306
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,379
Let me see which one looks the best on me.

307
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,680
(All he thinks about is the close-up shot. Which one will he choose?)

308
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:43,701
All right. Here we go.

309
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:46,012
- 5, 4, - Use our telepathy!

310
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:50,268
- 3, 2, 1. - Whoever gets it wrong is done for.

311
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,060
- We don't have to think about this. - It's so obvious.

312
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,830
(It has to be the pair of glasses with the big nose.)

313
00:11:55,831 --> 00:11:57,430
- That's right. This has to be it. - It's the big nose.

314
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,330
- This is it. Great. - We don't even need to think.

315
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:01,188
(Except for Seok Jin, all 7 of them chose the same one.)

316
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,196
(Now, Seok Jin has to choose the same pair.)

317
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:09,351
That's it.

318
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,009
(A shot with dizzy eyes)

319
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,092
Exactly.

320
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,674
- Why did he choose that one? - What is that? Darn it.

321
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,195
Come on, Seok Jin.

322
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,320
- You know what? - He wants to get a close-up.

323
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,715
This is what I said in my hut. I'll tell you what I said.

324
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,609
I said everyone would definitely go for this pair...

325
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,486
except for Seok Jin who wants to get a close-up.

326
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:26,899
- Seok Jin. - This is unbelievable.

327
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,960
- Don't try to stand out. - How could you choose that one?

328
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,600
I always wear that one. Do you think I want to put that on?

329
00:12:30,601 --> 00:12:32,269
- Exactly. I knew it. - I always wear that one.

330
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,260
- This is wrong. Seriously. - Look.

331
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,391
Hand them over. Seok Jin should get his penalty.

332
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,269
(A marker therapy to cure his syndrome begins.)

333
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,522
I should draw on his nose like this.

334
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,156
Hey, only one of you should do it.

335
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,098
- You look great. - Hey, you look so cool.

336
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,050
- Really? - You look like Tongki.

337
00:12:46,051 --> 00:12:47,393
- Are you serious? - You look great.

338
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:48,649
You look like a hero character.

339
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,994
- Okay, okay. - Really?

340
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,111
(Close-up Shot Hero, Mr. Seok Jin)

341
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:54,419
- Let's get it right this time. - Let's do this right.

342
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,489
- Let's take this seriously. - Be serious.

343
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,349
Don't think about yourself, but the whole group.

344
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,702
I'm serious.

345
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,377
I didn't predict this. See? Look at him.

346
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,481
- Look at him. - He was in "Snowpiercer".

347
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,230
- "Snowpiercer". - Right.

348
00:13:04,231 --> 00:13:05,817
- Right. He looks just like her. - It's his lost sister.

349
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,952
Go look for your sister.

350
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,409
- Let's focus. - This is so frustrating.

351
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,360
- Now, I want to stand out too. - All right.

352
00:13:12,811 --> 00:13:14,901
I bet you're starting to want those close-up shots.

353
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,440
You want those shots little by little.

354
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,097
Seok Jin is enjoying this.

355
00:13:18,451 --> 00:13:19,724
He's liking this.

356
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,820
Gosh, name tags?

357
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:25,173
(Are those name tags of the members?)

358
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:28,750
(Why are there name tags out of the blue?)

359
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,830
"Among the members of Running Man,"

360
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:34,426
"choose the name tag of the ugliest member."

361
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:38,224
(The ugliest member?)

362
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,970
(A while ago, Yoon Ju lined up members based on their looks.)

363
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,971
(According to Yoon Ju's standard, Jae Seok was ranked last.)

364
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:50,180
(Given this result from a recent episode...)

365
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:52,504
I'm 100 percent sure. I'm completely sure.

366
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,463
It has to be him.

367
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,820
He's the ugliest.

368
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:59,989
I'm torn between this guy and Jae Seok.

369
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,590
(But the problem is Se Chan, the dark-horse candidate.)

370
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,772
Goodness, this is tough.

371
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,300
(Which one should they choose from this rivalry?)

372
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,512
This is driving me crazy.

373
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,169
You're asking which of my parents I like more.

374
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,353
(An infinite loop of thoughts)

375
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,603
Se Chan... After he joined, things have gotten confusing.

376
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:22,480
I'll go with him.

377
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:24,249
It's impossible for me not to choose him.

378
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,260
(He picks the original ugly member.)

379
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:27,631
But it has to be Jae Seok.

380
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:29,592
It's Jae Seok.

381
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,389
Gosh, it makes...

382
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,987
It makes no sense that I'm choosing my own name.

383
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,889
The ugliest member?

384
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,608
(Will he save his team or his self-respect?)

385
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,830
First of all...

386
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,029
(When the ugly ones were full of worries...)

387
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,515
Without all the accessories!

388
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,869
(A crucial phrase, "without all the accessories")

389
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:48,264
Hey, glasses aren't accessories.

390
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,184
Removing all the accessories?

391
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,210
Let me make a decision based on just the looks.

392
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:55,009
(Everyone is inclined to choose Jae Seok. What's their decision?)

393
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,050
Come on out.

394
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,779
- This is crazy. - It was so tough.

395
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,225
- Why is this so hard? - Hey, you know who it is, right?

396
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:01,240
- I was having an inner conflict. - Why was it so hard?

397
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,710
- It was so tough. - It was really hard.

398
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,333
It was really hard,

399
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,220
but without all the accessories,

400
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,090
- it was easy. - How could you do that?

401
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,860
- I said my glasses stay. - That's nonsense.

402
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,678
- I said my glasses stay. - That's nonsense. Hey.

403
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,529
(Jae Seok chose Seok Jin.)

404
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,629
- I thought long and hard about it. - Don't you know?

405
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,970
I gave it a lot of thought.

406
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,758
- I thought you knew. - Se Chan and Seok Jin.

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,889
- I thought a lot about this. - 1, 2, 3.

408
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,859
- I'm sure we all chose Jae Seok. - She chose Se Chan.

409
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:26,840
- She chose Se Chan. - Come on.

410
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,909
- Hold on. - You chose Se Chan?

411
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,340
- Without glasses and popularity, - It's a mess.

412
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:30,879
- it has to be Jae Seok. - Yes, you're right.

413
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,050
- It was either Se Chan or Jae Seok. - Right, it was neck and neck.

414
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:34,879
- I... - Female staff members said...

415
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,820
- he was handsome. I remembered it. - Right, they like him.

416
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,467
- Yes, he's handsome. - But...

417
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,389
- I never heard that Jae Seok was. - Me neither. Not even once.

418
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,178
(But I've never heard that Jae Seok was handsome.)

419
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,330
- I heard them say that he was cool. - The thing about me is...

420
00:15:45,331 --> 00:15:47,129
- I know it. - I heard them say you were cool.

421
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,899
- Among F4, - What do you know?

422
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,618
- I'm not the one. - I do agree you are popular.

423
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,269
- Who are the F4? - F4...

424
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,411
- Who are the F4? - Do you not know?

425
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,869
- Who are they? - Lee Kwang Soo, Jee Seok Jin,

426
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,083
Yang Se Chan, and me.

427
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,940
(A quartet of members with Grade F looks)

428
00:15:59,941 --> 00:16:01,039
You're Gu Jun Pyo.

429
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
It's like getting an F for a class.

430
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:04,399
- You're the leader of the gang. - No.

431
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:05,779
- He's the leader. - The leader of the ugly members.

432
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,119
- He's the leader. - Why am I the leader? It's you.

433
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,080
- You, F4. - He's disappointed.

434
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:11,749
- Seriously. - Give us the markers.

435
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,919
They need to get makeup done.

436
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,375
- The markers. - Ji Hyo will get another one?

437
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,590
- Let me draw your lips bigger. - No, it's the last ounce of pride.

438
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,712
- I'm furious. - We have to finish this up.

439
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:22,955
- What is it? - You look cool.

440
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:25,581
It says, "ugly".

441
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,696
- That jerk. My goodness. - Hey.

442
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,769
- It's not makeup. It's a tattoo. - I'm so angry.

443
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,326
- It says, "ugly". - "Ugly".

444
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:35,128
Goodness, I'm so mad.

445
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,779
- Jae Seok, - You should accept who you are.

446
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,080
you're the ugliest.

447
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,879
- Objectively speaking... - Accept it.

448
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,274
- I'm furious. - I can't believe this.

449
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:43,789
Let's hurry up.

450
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,841
- Don't try to stand out. - Let's get this over with.

451
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:48,460
That was close.

452
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,259
(For this round, their unanimous decision is about...)

453
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,989
(the name tags again?)

454
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,182
- It's this again? - Among the members,

455
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,215
choose the most...

456
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,548
good-looking member.

457
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:01,940
(That's really hard too!)

458
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:03,082
It's too hard.

459
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:05,010
(It's harder than the college entrance exam.)

460
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:06,810
It's harder than the college entrance exam.

461
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:07,992
(It's harder than the college entrance exam.)

462
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,350
(He sighs as he is tormented by the thoughts.)

463
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,038
You don't want me to pick anyone.

464
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,020
You don't want to choose anyone. Isn't that it?

465
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:19,202
(There's a good-looking member?)

466
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,041
(Kwang Soo thinks long and hard about it.)

467
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,159
(He flashes the Prince of Asia's smile out of nowhere.)

468
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,220
To be honest, personally, it's me.

469
00:17:27,601 --> 00:17:28,729
It's just my opinion.

470
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,830
(It's me.)

471
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,013
But...

472
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:34,328
(Hesitant)

473
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,556
So many people are jealous of me.

474
00:17:38,111 --> 00:17:39,353
I'm serious.

475
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,224
That's why they won't choose me.

476
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,297
Gosh, I don't look great today.

477
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:48,783
I'm not in my best shape. I was sick yesterday.

478
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:51,239
I'm me,

479
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:52,649
so I'll choose myself.

480
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,700
(He is not only muscular but also narcissistic.)

481
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,105
Think, So Min.

482
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,643
Imagine the world has come to an end.

483
00:17:57,761 --> 00:18:00,689
These are the only men left on earth.

484
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,770
The world has come to an end, and you have to choose a man.

485
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:04,830
(She is playing a truth game.)

486
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,446
Imagine you're getting married.

487
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:10,409
Jong Kook's face is actually very cute.

488
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,840
His eyes when he smiles, right?

489
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,580
When he smiles with his eyes, he looks like a nice person.

490
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:14,651
But...

491
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:18,379
it'd be hard to be his wife.

492
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,623
I can't stop thinking about that.

493
00:18:21,521 --> 00:18:23,250
This question...

494
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:25,619
They want us to fail.

495
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,090
I was choosing between me and another person.

496
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,159
Stay out of it.

497
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,290
Seriously.

498
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,249
You look like a cuttlefish.

499
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,620
You look like a webfoot octopus.

500
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,480
Gosh.

501
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,698
- You're stir-fried anchovies. - Stir-fried anchovies.

502
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:43,340
Seriously.

503
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,409
- One, - All of us?

504
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,754
- 2... - 2,

505
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,110
- Three. - Let's be honest.

506
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:48,679
- I chose Jong Kook. - It's definitely Jong Kook.

507
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,780
It's definitely Jong Kook.

508
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,510
Gosh. I can't believe you.

509
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,149
So Min.

510
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,767
So Min.

511
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,990
Do you seriously think Haha is good-looking?

512
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,260
I was choosing between him and Jong Kook.

513
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:01,389
No.

514
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,919
(So Min, that's enough.)

515
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,779
I didn't expect you to choose me.

516
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,060
Gosh.

517
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,600
Even if she wanted to choose me,

518
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:09,260
she would never choose me. I knew it.

519
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:12,059
There must be reasons why Haha is married.

520
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,757
It must be his looks.

521
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,399
- Calm down. - Was I being petty?

522
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,369
(They fail to give unanimous answers.)

523
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,835
- What a shame. - You can't blame me.

524
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,001
(Can we finish today?)

525
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:23,879
- Three. - It was hard.

526
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,879
Look.

527
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,949
(They continue to give different answers.)

528
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,990
Gosh.

529
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,262
I...

530
00:19:28,821 --> 00:19:31,114
I at least gave you both lenses.

531
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,060
(They fail the next question too.)

532
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,119
The worst.

533
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
(The worst makeup)

534
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:39,088
This is too much. It's not okay.

535
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:40,979
It's about time we succeeded.

536
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,830
- Let's do this, okay? - Okay!

537
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:44,469
- Let's succeed. - We have to succeed this time.

538
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,592
- Let's succeed this time. - You know this.

539
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,669
(What is the next question?)

540
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,680
What is it?

541
00:19:50,241 --> 00:19:51,969
(Choose the name that comes to your mind...)

542
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,557
(when you hear the word, "betrayer".)

543
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,627
I don't even have to think.

544
00:19:56,281 --> 00:19:57,362
It's...

545
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,110
Lee Kwang Soo!

546
00:19:59,111 --> 00:20:00,550
(Kwang Soo is the biggest betrayer.)

547
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:01,550
(The staff must want us to succeed.)

548
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,611
You gave us a very easy question.

549
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,419
I can go out even now.

550
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,550
It's obvious.

551
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:08,290
(They don't even see any other names.)

552
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,472
It's too easy.

553
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,072
Let's go!

554
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,560
(5 people have chosen Kwang Soo right away.)

555
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:18,600
I don't even have to think.

556
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,469
It's obvious.

557
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,570
I don't even have to say anything.

558
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:24,943
The problem is if Kwang Soo will choose his name.

559
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,582
Gosh.

560
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:32,926
You just have to choose your own name!

561
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,440
Choose your name if you're a man!

562
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:37,189
This is driving me crazy.

563
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,590
(The man in question...)

564
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,020
(is thinking hard.)

565
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,990
3, 2, 1.

566
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,030
Come out!

567
00:20:44,031 --> 00:20:45,102
(Team or pride?)

568
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:47,612
One. Come out!

569
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,330
- I won't forgive you. - Seriously...

570
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:51,369
It's so easy.

571
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,371
- It's a gift from the staff. - The staff wants us to stop.

572
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,213
It's a gift.

573
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:57,939
- Shouldn't he come out? - Seriously.

574
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,110
- Kwang Soo. - Why isn't he out yet?

575
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:03,080
- Just a second. Let me check. - Shouldn't Kwang Soo come out?

576
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,709
Why would he even think?

577
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,862
He won't come out!

578
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,919
(The door opens.)

579
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,020
Pick up your name right now!

580
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,990
(Yelling)

581
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,250
I can't make up my mind.

582
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,619
- Put this down! - Why?

583
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,790
- Put this down! - What's wrong?

584
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:15,889
Pick up your name!

585
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,659
- You don't need all these. - What?

586
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,659
Bring your name.

587
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,105
- Leave your name on the table. - Come out!

588
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,129
- I'm choosing between the two. - Go out!

589
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:23,170
Go out!

590
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:24,811
There he comes.

591
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,229
Let's hang Kwang Soo up here.

592
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,600
Hey. You didn't have to think.

593
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,409
- Just admit it. - Why would you think?

594
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,209
- This is a gift from the staff. - We should just accept it.

595
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,740
- That's their intention. - One.

596
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:37,327
- Gosh. - Two.

597
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:39,294
- Three. - Yes!

598
00:21:40,251 --> 00:21:43,379
(They unanimously chose Kwang Soo.)

599
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,603
Yes!

600
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:47,020
Kwang Soo, you might have a different idea,

601
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,737
but we have to finish this game.

602
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,748
Congratulations.

603
00:21:50,761 --> 00:21:52,889
- Here is the first hint. - Okay.

604
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,971
(The first hint after an hour and 20 minutes.)

605
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,530
(What food is their father looking for?)

606
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,691
It's our grandma's...

607
00:21:57,801 --> 00:22:01,134
(This ingredient must have lived in the water.)

608
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,584
"This ingredient must have lived in the water."

609
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,152
It must be fish.

610
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,639
It might be seaweed as well.

611
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,690
(Fish? Seafood?)

612
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:09,740
- "Lived in the water". - "Lived in the water".

613
00:22:09,741 --> 00:22:10,810
(If you combine the video and the hint...)

614
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,310
When I was little, every autumn,

615
00:22:13,311 --> 00:22:17,949
my mother would make this dish for me.

616
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,212
(This ingredient is in season in the autumn and lives in the water?)

617
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,959
- In the autumn... - Jumbo shrimp.

618
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,030
Jumbo shrimp.

619
00:22:24,031 --> 00:22:25,229
It could be jumbo shrimp.

620
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,149
- It's in season now. - That's right.

621
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,830
There's a jumbo shrimp festival. Are we on the west coast?

622
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,070
- We're on Oido﻿. That's right. - It's definitely jumbo shrimp then.

623
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,869
- Jumbo shrimp. - Let's go for jumbo shrimp.

624
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:35,951
Okay.

625
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,242
(Is "jumbo shrimp" the correct answer?)

626
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,750
(They move to a jumbo shrimp restaurant.)

627
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:45,832
- Let's go. - Let's go.

628
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,320
- Jumbo shrimp. - I hope we're right.

629
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:49,320
(If they're right, they can go home.)

630
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:50,449
I'm following because it's good food.

631
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:52,137
But I can't eat it because of my cholesterol level.

632
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,490
- What? - That's right.

633
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:55,159
But you can eat the tails.

634
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,760
- Is that right? - The head has the most.

635
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:59,214
I could eat the tails then.

636
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,280
- We could have ramyeon too. - I could eat the tails then.

637
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,300
Jumbo shrimp ramyeon?

638
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:04,570
- Jumbo shrimp ramyeon. - Okay.

639
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:06,330
- Let's go! - Let's go!

640
00:23:06,331 --> 00:23:07,653
Let's go, everybody!

641
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,380
Let's check it out.

642
00:23:10,041 --> 00:23:11,627
You're full of energy.

643
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,326
I slept a lot.

644
00:23:13,581 --> 00:23:15,209
- You slept a lot? - Did you sleep for four hours?

645
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,310
I slept a lot.

646
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,775
If you sleep a lot, you sleep well the next day too.

647
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:20,649
Don't you wake up around 5am?

648
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,750
(Se Chan is provoking Seok Jin.)

649
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,020
It's not like that.

650
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,939
Don't you go to the mineral spring early in the morning?

651
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,189
He plays badminton too.

652
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,504
He walks around while clapping his hands.

653
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,085
- I massage my back against a tree. - Against a tree.

654
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,830
- I do the front-and-back claps. - The front-and-back claps.

655
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,800
I really hope it's jumbo shrimp that our grandma liked.

656
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,386
We're here.

657
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,682
It'll be so tasty.

658
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:43,909
- There really is jumbo shrimp. - Look at that shrimp.

659
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,740
Guys, look at this.

660
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,781
(If "jumbo shrimp" is right, they can go home.)

661
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:48,540
Look at this.

662
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:49,679
(They're at a jumbo shrimp restaurant.)

663
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,095
Look at this. It's live shrimp.

664
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,520
(Their grandma used to make this dish every autumn.)

665
00:23:56,521 --> 00:23:59,854
(The ingredient lives in the water. Is it jumbo shrimp?)

666
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,419
Along with the name of the ingredient,

667
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,007
please say the name of the dish.

668
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:08,030
You have to get both correct.

669
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,229
The ingredient is jumbo shrimp, right?

670
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,429
Definitely.

671
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,030
But is it grilled or steamed?

672
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,600
- It must be grilled. - Grilled.

673
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,186
Jumbo shrimp has to be grilled.

674
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:16,956
In the autumn, you have to grill the jumbo shrimp.

675
00:24:17,011 --> 00:24:18,021
That's right.

676
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:20,209
You cover the grill with salt...

677
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,840
- That's exactly right. - and put the shrimp on it.

678
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:22,851
(Grilled jumbo shrimp is the best autumn dish.)

679
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,223
- Right, right. - Hey.

680
00:24:24,351 --> 00:24:26,610
But grilled jumbo shrimp is too hard.

681
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:27,893
It's softer when steamed.

682
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:30,689
(When steamed, you can enjoy the soft flesh of jumbo shrimp.)

683
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,250
On the count of three, please say the name of the dish.

684
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:34,389
- Okay. - Grilled jumbo shrimp.

685
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,590
- Grilled jumbo shrimp. - Grilled jumbo shrimp.

686
00:24:35,591 --> 00:24:36,590
(They're leaning towards grilled jumbo shrimp.)

687
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:37,640
- Grilled jumbo shrimp. - I don't know.

688
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,929
It has to be grilled.

689
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,760
(Dad, did you eat grilled jumbo shrimp every autumn?)

690
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:41,899
Grilled jumbo shrimp.

691
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,060
It's grilled jumbo shrimp.

692
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:44,369
We have to make up our minds.

693
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,469
- Grilled jumbo shrimp. - Okay.

694
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,340
1, 2, 3.

695
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,340
- Grilled jumbo shrimp. - Sashimi!

696
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:50,000
(What is their answer?)

697
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:52,010
What's with you? Gosh.

698
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,740
(Seok Jin shouts, "sashimi", alone.)

699
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:54,822
What's with you?

700
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:57,010
He has close-up syndrome.

701
00:24:57,011 --> 00:24:58,324
(There he goes again.)

702
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,449
I don't understand him.

703
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,379
- What's with you? - We all said it at the same time.

704
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:04,270
His voice is too loud.

705
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,850
He definitely has close-up syndrome.

706
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:07,860
- He said it too loud. - Yes.

707
00:25:07,861 --> 00:25:10,889
He knew that he'd be the only one who'd say it.

708
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,459
He was aware of it.

709
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,830
You're so smart.

710
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,330
(He admits it right away.)

711
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:17,290
(Seok Jin loves close-ups.)

712
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:19,030
Let's go for sashimi.

713
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,199
No.

714
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,840
- It's grilled. - Let's start with grilled.

715
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,100
Grilled.

716
00:25:23,101 --> 00:25:25,409
- Jumbo shrimp has to be grilled. - Let's go for it.

717
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,879
- Let's do it. - Okay.

718
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,010
Grilled.

719
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,439
1, 2, 3.

720
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,449
- Grilled jumbo shrimp! - Grilled jumbo shrimp!

721
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,850
(Is "grilled jumbo shrimp" correct?)

722
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:33,879
(Wrong)

723
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,093
It's sashimi!

724
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,573
(Is "jumbo shrimp" wrong?)

725
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,350
- Is it gizzard shad then? - Why is it wrong?

726
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:41,260
All right. You're at a restaurant,

727
00:25:41,261 --> 00:25:43,490
so you have to eat grilled jumbo shrimp before you can leave.

728
00:25:43,491 --> 00:25:45,030
- That's good. - We can eat?

729
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:46,330
(They have to eat before leaving.)

730
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,060
What kind of rule is that?

731
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:49,129
(That's a great rule.)

732
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,830
I think our grandma loved lobster.

733
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,699
Should we go for lobster?

734
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,782
We'll keep saying wrong answers.

735
00:25:55,241 --> 00:25:57,240
But we don't have much time.

736
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:58,510
(There's not much time left.)

737
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,709
We have to say the correct answer within the given time.

738
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,409
Eating will take some time.

739
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,580
- We're doomed. - He's so smart.

740
00:26:03,581 --> 00:26:07,086
(They'll be penalized if they don't succeed before sunset.)

741
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:11,290
By carrying out a mission, you can win an additional hint.

742
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,320
The mission is called...

743
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,760
Dried Persimmon Hat.

744
00:26:14,761 --> 00:26:16,539
(Dried Persimmon Hat)

745
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,290
We have to eat the hat?

746
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:19,760
(They have to bite the dried persimmon hanging from the hat.)

747
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,030
- We've done this before. - Kwang Soo and I...

748
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:24,859
- That's right. - We did this to meet UIe.

749
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,985
(This game makes you look as ugly as you can.)

750
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,969
All of you will take turns.

751
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,939
You're given 3 minutes. If you succeed 8 times,

752
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,850
you'll get a "high" hint and eight portions of food.

753
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,750
If you succeed 5 times, you'll get a "medium" hint and 6 portions.

754
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:42,320
If you succeed 3 times, you'll get a "low" hint and 4 portions.

755
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:45,250
If you succeed 0 times, you'll get the "lowest" hint...

756
00:26:45,251 --> 00:26:46,432
and only a single serving of food.

757
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:48,719
One portion of jumbo shrimp is nothing.

758
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,760
There will be about three pieces.

759
00:26:49,761 --> 00:26:53,030
By the way, is the ingredient jumbo shrimp?

760
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:54,979
Do you think they'll tell us, you fool?

761
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,715
Do you think they'll tell us?

762
00:26:57,071 --> 00:26:58,399
Gosh, she's so stupid.

763
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,429
(Seok Jin thinks Ji Hyo is stupid.)

764
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:01,139
Our viewers are saying, "You're the stupid one."

765
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,655
(We can almost see the board.)

766
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,540
(Who's calling who stupid? Seok Jin is the stupid one.)

767
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,040
- "You're the stupid one." - What's wrong with asking?

768
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:09,080
It was a good question.

769
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:11,131
(He must be upset about not eating jumbo shrimp sashimi.)

770
00:27:11,351 --> 00:27:13,649
- Oh, that game. - It's very hard.

771
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,095
- I've never tried it. - It's really hard.

772
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:17,512
Kwang Soo was so funny when he played it.

773
00:27:17,591 --> 00:27:18,949
You'll take turns.

774
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,389
If you think you'll fail, you have to pass the chance.

775
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,990
You can start by saying, "start".

776
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:24,229
1, 2, 3.

777
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,240
- Start! - Start!

778
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:28,025
(They're given 3 minutes.)

779
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,100
(It's coming.)

780
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:32,330
(The hilarious Kwang Soo is coming.)

781
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:33,341
I can't see anything.

782
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,270
- It doesn't matter. - I can't see the persimmon.

783
00:27:35,271 --> 00:27:36,281
Hey.

784
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:38,709
(Class is permanent.)

785
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,054
This is Kwang Soo's specialty.

786
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:42,596
- You're almost there. - Kwang Soo.

787
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,970
Kwang Soo. You look like a fish.

788
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,750
(He's good at looking funny, but not at biting the persimmon.)

789
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:47,761
Pass.

790
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,119
A little more.

791
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,675
Kwang Soo, why can't you do it?

792
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,189
- He almost got it. - Hey.

793
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,889
- Pass it. - Kwang Soo.

794
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,229
(Time passes by, and he can't catch the dried persimmon.)

795
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,917
Kwang Soo, stop it.

796
00:28:01,361 --> 00:28:03,030
(Slapping)

797
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,830
Pass it.

798
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,399
(Stop sticking out your tongue, and pass it.)

799
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,699
I almost got it.

800
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,439
- Stop it. - I almost got it.

801
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,925
(Haha gives it a try.)

802
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,470
- Goodness, Haha. - It's too heavy.

803
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:17,023
- Haha. - I got it.

804
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:18,709
- Haha. - Now.

805
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,110
- Haha. - Bite it.

806
00:28:20,111 --> 00:28:21,463
Just bite it.

807
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:23,490
(It touches his tongue.)

808
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,750
It may get on his tongue.

809
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:28,119
(However, he must bite it to succeed.)

810
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,389
- Yes, bite it. - Haha.

811
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,459
He got it.

812
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,753
(He bites it.)

813
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,100
He got it.

814
00:28:35,101 --> 00:28:37,091
- It's possible. - Next is So Min.

815
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,070
You can't eat it like that.

816
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:40,600
(She's obviously a beginner.)

817
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:42,600
That won't work. Yes, lower your head.

818
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:43,740
Lower your head.

819
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:46,064
You must be determined to do it.

820
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:47,622
So Min.

821
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,720
So Min.

822
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,310
Lower your head forward.

823
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,178
- Goodness. - She looks like Ahn Young Mi.

824
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,449
Look, they look similar, right?

825
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,217
She looks like Ahn Young Mi. Don't they look the same?

826
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:01,739
- It's her when she was younger. - Noh Joo Hyun...

827
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:02,919
and Ahn Young Mi.

828
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,405
So Min.

829
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:06,629
- Bite it. - Come on.

830
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,129
Do it like a frog.

831
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,958
(She uses a frog tactic.)

832
00:29:12,771 --> 00:29:14,921
You got it.

833
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:17,768
- You can do it. - Hop like a frog.

834
00:29:17,811 --> 00:29:20,110
- Hop, hop. - You got it.

835
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:22,310
You got it.

836
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:23,724
- You almost got it. - So Min.

837
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:26,637
(She bites it.)

838
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,373
- She got it. - All right.

839
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,072
- What's the time? - There's a method.

840
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:39,358
(Expert Jae Seok sighed while watching frustrating beginners.)

841
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,500
(He shows his method.)

842
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,824
That's not a method.

843
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,413
You're the ugliest.

844
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:50,656
He looks so ugly.

845
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,709
- Come on, Jae Seok. - Do it more.

846
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,179
- Use your protruding mouth. - It's over.

847
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,272
Use your protruding mouth, Jae Seok.

848
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,203
You can't miss out on the shrimp.

849
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:02,250
- Goodness. - Look at his mouth.

850
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:03,664
(He pulls out his lips and his tongue.)

851
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,219
- That's good. - It's now.

852
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,760
- It's now. - That's good.

853
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:10,689
(Licking)

854
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:12,271
That's good.

855
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:16,341
(They cheer at his method that makes him look ugly.)

856
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:18,553
- Didn't I eat it? - Stop it.

857
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:21,191
Bite it. Hurry up.

858
00:30:21,801 --> 00:30:22,899
That's right.

859
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,709
- That's right. - You got it.

860
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,709
Okay.

861
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,479
(A total of 3 people made it.)

862
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,500
Next is Jong Kook.

863
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,429
- I got it. - Darn it.

864
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,169
It looks easy.

865
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:37,643
- He looks like a shark. - The persimmon's moving by itself.

866
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:40,760
(I won't eat you if you give me a dried persimmon.)

867
00:30:40,761 --> 00:30:42,459
Jong Kook.

868
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,490
(He looks like a tiger.)

869
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:45,380
Just bite it.

870
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,371
He got it.

871
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,448
(He hunts down a dried persimmon.)

872
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:51,399
(A total of 4 succeed.)

873
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,770
That was fast.

874
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:54,699
- Did you make it? 40 seconds. - I got it.

875
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,010
- It's delicious. - Hurry up, Seok Jin.

876
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:58,110
He's alone on camera.

877
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:00,535
- Wake up, Seok Jin. - It's his shot.

878
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:03,268
He's taking all the attention from the cameras.

879
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,305
He's alone on camera. He's enjoying it.

880
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,062
He's doing well.

881
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:10,714
You can do it if you focus, Seok Jin.

882
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,619
It's because you aren't focusing.

883
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,630
(Focusing)

884
00:31:14,491 --> 00:31:15,719
- That's right. - That's it.

885
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,260
(Seok Jin succeeds.)

886
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:18,729
- Great. - Okay.

887
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,862
(After five people succeed, Ji Hyo gives it a try.)

888
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:23,881
- That's right. - Ji Hyo.

889
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,950
- Bite it when it comes down. - Ji Hyo.

890
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,459
- 15 seconds, Ji Hyo. - That's right.

891
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,590
- You almost got it. - Ji Hyo.

892
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,610
- Here it is. Bite it. - Hurry.

893
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:34,126
- Ace. - Bite it.

894
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,227
Bite it. That's right.

895
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,209
(It won't work. Pass it.)

896
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,350
- Pass it to Se Chan. - Pass.

897
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:43,038
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

898
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:46,419
- 10, 9, 8. - That's right.

899
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:49,619
(He turns into Maeng Gu.)

900
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,348
He looks like Maeng Gu.

901
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,805
Are you acting?

902
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:56,059
My goodness.

903
00:31:56,531 --> 00:31:57,742
Are you acting?

904
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,669
- Are you being funny? - He's being funny.

905
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,000
That's out of the blue.

906
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:02,540
He's acting.

907
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:06,070
(Limited time of 3 minutes is up.)

908
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:08,179
There wasn't enough time.

909
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,383
- Why were you acting? - There wasn't enough time.

910
00:32:12,011 --> 00:32:15,320
- I almost had it. - Five of you made it.

911
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:17,889
You'll get a medium hint and six servings of shrimp.

912
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,719
- That's amazing. - That's a lot.

913
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,144
- We did quite well. - Okay.

914
00:32:22,361 --> 00:32:23,560
That's a lot.

915
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:25,659
You gained six servings.

916
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,760
Please pick two members who won't eat.

917
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,114
Let's play Race of Wits.

918
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:30,341
The three of us?

919
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,300
- We'll play Race of Wits. - All of us?

920
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,540
All of us.

921
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:36,268
Here comes the first to be eliminated. Start.

922
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,351
One.

923
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,961
- Two. - I'm going to sell him.

924
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:41,351
Three.

925
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,010
- 4. - 5.

926
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:44,510
- 6. - 7.

927
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:45,550
(Jong Kook is eliminated.)

928
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,619
He's so bad at Race of Wits.

929
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,879
(Let's see.)

930
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,719
(Shall I stand...)

931
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,922
(Shall I stand up?)

932
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,429
- I'm usually tactless. - He doesn't like being tactful.

933
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,743
One is eliminated.

934
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:01,129
- One is eliminated. - We need one more.

935
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,929
I'll win no matter what.

936
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,429
- Start. - One.

937
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,845
(Round 2 starts.)

938
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,300
Two.

939
00:33:09,301 --> 00:33:10,321
Three.

940
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,570
- 4. - 5.

941
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:12,610
- 6. - 6.

942
00:33:12,611 --> 00:33:16,580
(Haha and Se Chan are selected.)

943
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,750
Goodness.

944
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:20,619
(The rest get to eat jumbo shrimp.)

945
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,298
This is great.

946
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:23,520
I'll eat.

947
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:25,814
- One of us can eat, right? - Yes.

948
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,260
Let's do it.

949
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,967
(Haha and Se Chan compete to eat jumbo shrimp.)

950
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:33,429
- What are you confident about? - A quiz?

951
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,047
Okay, let's do a quiz.

952
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,399
- Go ahead. - Let's do a quiz.

953
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,410
(I'll defeat you with a quiz.)

954
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:39,313
Goodness.

955
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,740
(Haha and Se Chan are competitive in quizzes.)

956
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:48,022
(They fought hard to avoid being the worst quiz taker.)

957
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:53,671
(Due to his bad English skills, Se Chan lost.)

958
00:33:53,851 --> 00:33:56,990
The one who answers Jae Seok's question wins.

959
00:33:56,991 --> 00:33:59,819
I really don't want to lose this one.

960
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,878
I'm curious. It's nerve-racking.

961
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,250
- This is most entertaining. - A competition between them...

962
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,850
- Capital cities? - A question about capital cities?

963
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,559
That sounds good. Here's a question about capital cities.

964
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,227
(Will Se Chan be okay with Haha's suggestion?)

965
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,882
How about in South America?

966
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,492
- South America? - How about Southeast Asia?

967
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,539
- Southeast Asia? - I'm an expert.

968
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,910
I prefer South America.

969
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,439
- Southeast Asia is fine. - Is that okay?

970
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,995
- That's fine. - All right.

971
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,121
Capital city of Singapore.

972
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:27,198
Wait.

973
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:30,820
- Singapore? - I know this.

974
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:33,189
This is crazy.

975
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,908
(He's full of confidence.)

976
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,729
- This is difficult. - I know this.

977
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,760
- Se Chan knows the answer. - This is crazy.

978
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:42,129
What's the capital city of Singapore? You have five seconds.

979
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,829
(They must write the capital city of Singapore.)

980
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,053
This is frustrating. I know the answer.

981
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:49,169
If this is correct, I'm a genius.

982
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,341
The capital city of Singapore is quite easy.

983
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:54,340
- Haha. - Did he write it?

984
00:34:54,341 --> 00:34:56,533
- Yes. - He's almost done.

985
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,010
- What's the capital city? - This is wrong.

986
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,919
- Wait. - Let's take a look.

987
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,379
In 1, 2, 3.

988
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,249
(Haha shows his answer first.)

989
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,660
- One of us can eat. - Yes.

990
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:10,530
(You need a correct answer to eat.)

991
00:35:10,531 --> 00:35:14,298
(Haha isn't confident. What is his answer?)

992
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:17,229
- Kuala Lumpur is in Malaysia. - That's Malaysia.

993
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,399
That's in Malaysia. Here's mine.

994
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,599
(The capital city of Singapore)

995
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,640
Changi?

996
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,762
(Changi is the capital city of Singapore?)

997
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:28,240
(It's a creative answer.)

998
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,029
Do you mean Song Chang Eui?

999
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,979
You mean Nam Chang Eui? What's that?

1000
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,394
- Who? - Changi.

1001
00:35:34,721 --> 00:35:36,019
Is that the capital city?

1002
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,649
He's talking about the international airport.

1003
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,390
That's Changi International Airport.

1004
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,990
- Isn't that the capital city? - That's the name of the airport.

1005
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:45,808
We have Incheon Airport. Is that our capital city?

1006
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,319
We have Gimpo Airport. Is Gimpo our capital city?

1007
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,829
What's the capital city of Singapore?

1008
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,698
The capital city is Singapore, right?

1009
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:54,700
Really?

1010
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:55,870
The capital city of Singapore is Singapore.

1011
00:35:55,871 --> 00:35:57,209
That's why he asked this question.

1012
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,610
- The city is a country. - It's an interesting question.

1013
00:35:59,611 --> 00:36:02,379
We don't have time to waste.

1014
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,550
- Let's hurry. - We have to find it.

1015
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,419
All right, what's the capital city of Mongolia?

1016
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,479
(What's the capital city of Mongolia?)

1017
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,820
- I know this. Goodness. - We've been there.

1018
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:13,163
We've been there.

1019
00:36:13,221 --> 00:36:14,419
- Goodness. - We went there.

1020
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,835
- I really know it. - We went there.

1021
00:36:15,891 --> 00:36:19,223
(Running Man had missions in Mongolia and Russia.)

1022
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,276
(Ulaanbaatar is the capital city.)

1023
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,789
The two of them didn't go to Mongolia.

1024
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,269
They went to Russia.

1025
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,669
I'll give you the first syllable.

1026
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,800
(He gives a hint.)

1027
00:36:27,801 --> 00:36:28,800
"Ul".

1028
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:30,659
(It's "Ul".)

1029
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,910
(Haha writes it down as soon as he hears it.)

1030
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:35,204
- Isn't it "Ul"? - That's right.

1031
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:36,280
He got it.

1032
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,492
(He has no idea.)

1033
00:36:37,611 --> 00:36:40,649
Listen, we don't have much time.

1034
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,979
- When will you finish? - Can we do it while eating?

1035
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,820
When will you finish?

1036
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:45,931
(They're taking too long.)

1037
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,360
We must go in six hours.

1038
00:36:48,361 --> 00:36:49,559
We have to finish.

1039
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,853
- 1, 2, 3. - I really don't want to lose.

1040
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,399
- Ulaanbaatar. - Ulaanbaatar.

1041
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,481
(Haha answers correctly.)

1042
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:58,930
(What did you say?)

1043
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:01,021
Ulaan what?

1044
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,240
"Ulaando..."?

1045
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:05,470
"Ulaandobuntu".

1046
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:06,910
"Ulaandobuntu"?

1047
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:08,809
(That's very creative.)

1048
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,477
Why didn't you write "Orlando Bloom"?

1049
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,479
- "Ulaandobuntu"? - Orlando Bloom.

1050
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,890
This is what I wrote.

1051
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:19,090
The answer is Ulaanbaatar.

1052
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:20,636
That's correct.

1053
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,941
What is "Ulaandobuntu"?

1054
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,559
(It's not made by their father.)

1055
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,348
(Grilled jumbo shrimp is a specialty in autumn.)

1056
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,098
(They eat quickly and move to their next mission.)

1057
00:37:37,071 --> 00:37:38,870
Come here, Creative Yang.

1058
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:40,295
"Creative Yang"?

1059
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,539
- Can I get one? - Yes.

1060
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,209
- I gave you mine last time. - Right.

1061
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,979
It's funny that he got Changi from the airport's name.

1062
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,879
I'll eat something delicious next time.

1063
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,720
Jumbo shrimp tastes so sweet when it's in season.

1064
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:52,720
(The grilled jumbo shrimp tastes amazing.)

1065
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,314
(He slurps the flesh.)

1066
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,289
(His reaction is so sincere.)

1067
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,430
It tastes so good.

1068
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:02,289
Try it with some lemon juice.

1069
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:03,542
That's it.

1070
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,769
- It tastes so good. - With lemon juice?

1071
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,053
The gourmet won the food.

1072
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:08,913
One of the pieces tasted really good.

1073
00:38:09,201 --> 00:38:10,251
It's so good.

1074
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,640
(It tastes good with some lemon?)

1075
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:12,740
Like this?

1076
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:15,140
(He puts a lemon slice on his shrimp.)

1077
00:38:15,141 --> 00:38:16,392
You can eat it this way too.

1078
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,050
Seriously.

1079
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:20,280
(He seems to be aiming for a close-up.)

1080
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,079
Shrimp tastes so good in season.

1081
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,849
(He pretends to be okay.)

1082
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,749
To get a close-up,

1083
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,013
- he wrapped it in a lemon slice. - He wrapped it in a lemon slice.

1084
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,848
He's full of energy today.

1085
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:33,456
It tastes so good with some lemon.

1086
00:38:34,431 --> 00:38:36,320
(We appreciate your efforts.)

1087
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,345
Can we eat the Enoki mushrooms too?

1088
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,583
- They taste good. - They taste good.

1089
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,300
(They even eat the mushrooms.)

1090
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:42,956
It's a shame.

1091
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,584
I want some more.

1092
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,307
We'd love to eat some more.

1093
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,309
(Haha gets to the bottom of his plate.)

1094
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,462
For breakfast?

1095
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,221
It's a shame.

1096
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:53,349
What is this?

1097
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,979
(He found something on his plate?)

1098
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,579
Should we try one more time with jumbo shrimp?

1099
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,919
(Under the mushrooms...)

1100
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,546
(was a mission note.)

1101
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:04,623
(I thought it was a normal dish. What is this?)

1102
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,450
Did you find anything under your food?

1103
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:08,899
What's that?

1104
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,253
(He receives a secret mission to call a number.)

1105
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:13,169
(Surprised)

1106
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,281
What's that?

1107
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,070
- What is this? - There was a hint?

1108
00:39:16,071 --> 00:39:17,370
(Only Haha received the mission.)

1109
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:18,439
- I don't have anything. - No one else?

1110
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,623
- No. - No.

1111
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:22,861
- What is it? - It's nothing.

1112
00:39:23,181 --> 00:39:24,450
Did you see it?

1113
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:26,110
- Share it with us. - We're a team.

1114
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:27,519
He's hiding something.

1115
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,720
Share it with us.

1116
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,174
We're siblings. We don't have to compete.

1117
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,836
We're a team.

1118
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,720
I didn't get anything,

1119
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:36,120
but I did see Haha's note.

1120
00:39:36,121 --> 00:39:37,430
(They search Kwang Soo's body.)

1121
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:38,890
Do you think I'm hiding something in my hair?

1122
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,599
(Why would you check my hair?)

1123
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,300
- Why did you check my hair? - Just in case.

1124
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,300
You're getting worse and worse.

1125
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,240
You're crossing the line.

1126
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,370
- Just to be sure. - You might be hiding something.

1127
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:51,693
- It's just to be sure. - I just wanted to check.

1128
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:54,010
You might be hiding something in your hair.

1129
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:55,039
In my hair?

1130
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,680
- My gosh. - We don't have much time,

1131
00:39:57,681 --> 00:39:59,749
so please decide where we should go next.

1132
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:00,879
- Blue crab. - Blue crab.

1133
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,668
(Their next answer is blue crab?)

1134
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,990
(The reason why they chose blue crab is...)

1135
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:07,620
(They received a medium hint after the persimmon hat mission.)

1136
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:08,904
Let's see the hint.

1137
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,800
"As a kid, I was afraid of touching this ingredient."

1138
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,447
"But my mom didn't seem to be."

1139
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,062
(It's something scary to touch?)

1140
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:23,809
(It's in season in the autumn,)

1141
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,240
(lives in the water,)

1142
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:30,846
(and is scary to touch.)

1143
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,349
(To combine all the hints so far...)

1144
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,360
Isn't it blue crab?

1145
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,808
- Autumn blue crab? - Or gizzard shad.

1146
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,289
Gizzard shad is scary to touch too.

1147
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,360
- I still can't touch fish. - Right.

1148
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,860
- It's too slippery. - That's right.

1149
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,991
Blue crabs are scary to touch because of their claws.

1150
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,700
(After finding out that the ingredient is scary to touch,)

1151
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:55,327
(they become divided between blue crab and gizzard shad.)

1152
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,507
(Is either of the answers correct?)

1153
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:04,280
(We think it's blue crab.)

1154
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:09,327
(After a discussion, they agree on blue crab.)

1155
00:41:09,721 --> 00:41:12,820
(Blue crab tastes amazing in the autumn.)

1156
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:14,220
(They decide on blue crab.)

1157
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,090
- Okay. Blue crab. - 1, 2, 3.

1158
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,090
- Blue crab. - Blue crab.

1159
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:18,390
Let's go to a blue crab restaurant.

1160
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:20,729
- I like it. - I still want more.

1161
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,059
It tasted so good.

1162
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,300
(Is "blue crab" the correct answer?)

1163
00:41:24,301 --> 00:41:25,715
I have to use the bathroom.

1164
00:41:26,871 --> 00:41:30,981
(Haha stays behind, saying he needs to use the bathroom.)

1165
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,939
(He goes to the staircase with his phone in his hand...)

1166
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,243
(instead of going to the bathroom.)

1167
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,820
(He tries calling the number written on the note...)

1168
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:45,649
(without others knowing.)

1169
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,519
(Someone answers the phone.)

1170
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,620
Hello.

1171
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:49,760
(Haha hears someone's voice.)

1172
00:41:49,761 --> 00:41:50,890
Is this Haha?

1173
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,990
(Haha hears someone's voice.)

1174
00:41:52,991 --> 00:41:55,229
(Haha hears something shocking.)

1175
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:57,624
(What did Haha hear?)

1176
00:41:58,531 --> 00:41:59,769
Did you receive a mission?

1177
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:00,840
Haha, are you a spy?

1178
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:02,039
No. I just went to the bathroom.

1179
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,099
I swear.

1180
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,110
What was written on that note?

1181
00:42:05,111 --> 00:42:06,570
Share it with us.

1182
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:09,579
We're trying to fulfil our father's request.

1183
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,780
That's right. We're a family.

1184
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:13,366
- Why would you... - You're right.

1185
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:15,032
I...

1186
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,313
The thing is, we might not be...

1187
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:21,360
- all siblings. - Really?

1188
00:42:21,361 --> 00:42:24,530
(They might not all be siblings?)

1189
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:26,046
- So I... - We might not all be siblings?

1190
00:42:26,261 --> 00:42:28,725
- Or... - We might not all be siblings?

1191
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:30,769
- Is someone adopted? - Let's just go.

1192
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,470
We might not all be siblings.

1193
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:35,764
(Is Haha saying the truth?)

1194
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,809
That person might be aware.

1195
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,760
(Time left)

1196
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,539
It has such a nice view.

1197
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,398
(They arrive at a sashimi place with an amazing view.)

1198
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:45,162
I love the view.

1199
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:48,309
We're at the second restaurant now.

1200
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,148
Which food did you choose?

1201
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,431
- Blue crab. - Blue crab.

1202
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,660
But it can be cooked in many different ways.

1203
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:56,930
It could be blue crab stew or steamed blue crab.

1204
00:42:56,931 --> 00:42:58,203
Wouldn't it be steamed blue crab?

1205
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:04,570
(Steamed blue crab has deep flavors from the autumn sea.)

1206
00:43:04,571 --> 00:43:08,580
(Is this Father's soul food?)

1207
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,055
Blue crab stew.

1208
00:43:11,141 --> 00:43:12,626
- It must be stew. - It must be stew.

1209
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:17,008
(Or is it spicy blue crab stew...)

1210
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,780
(made with Grandma's secret sauce?)

1211
00:43:19,781 --> 00:43:21,579
In this weather, stew might be better.

1212
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,849
- It's stew weather. - Stew would be better.

1213
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,249
- Also, - I think it's stew.

1214
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,890
we just ate grilled jumbo shrimp.

1215
00:43:26,891 --> 00:43:28,189
It has to be stew this time.

1216
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,320
Let's go for stew.

1217
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:30,775
Guys, listen.

1218
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,760
In the crab shell...

1219
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,499
With all the guts...

1220
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,599
(Haha attacks.)

1221
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,599
Blend it with some sesame oil,

1222
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,070
add some kimchi, and eat it.

1223
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:40,300
It seems to me that...

1224
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:42,461
everyone is talking about what they want to eat.

1225
00:43:42,701 --> 00:43:43,709
Should we vote?

1226
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:44,984
- Let's do that. - Let's do that.

1227
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,740
- Steamed blue crab. - Steamed blue crab.

1228
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:47,852
- Me. - Raise your hand.

1229
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:49,610
- 4 voted for steamed blue crab. - It's 4.

1230
00:43:49,611 --> 00:43:50,610
Should I vote for steamed blue crab?

1231
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,692
- Who wants stew? - Stew.

1232
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:53,391
Three. What about you?

1233
00:43:53,451 --> 00:43:54,680
You're the only one left.

1234
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:55,879
(Jong Kook is the only one left.)

1235
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,289
- Steamed blue crab. - I vote for steamed blue crab.

1236
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,649
- Okay. - Gosh.

1237
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:02,419
(With Jong Kook's vote, steamed blue crab wins.)

1238
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,571
I mean...

1239
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:05,329
- It's steamed blue crab. - Haha just said,

1240
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,744
"Steamed blue crab." That's why you said it.

1241
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,300
- My goodness. - Steamed blue crab is better.

1242
00:44:09,301 --> 00:44:12,027
Please say your answer on the count of three.

1243
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,129
One...

1244
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,539
1, 2, 3.

1245
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,539
- Steamed blue crab. - I want stew,

1246
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,652
but steamed blue crab.

1247
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,687
Let's say it again.

1248
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,010
1, 2, 3.

1249
00:44:21,011 --> 00:44:22,152
- Steamed blue crab. - Steamed blue crab.

1250
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,164
Gosh, your hands smell like shrimp.

1251
00:44:25,451 --> 00:44:26,649
My goodness.

1252
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:27,680
Steamed blue crab.

1253
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:30,349
(Is it the correct answer?)

1254
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,519
- It's wrong. - See?

1255
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,590
We'll get to eat it then.

1256
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:35,059
It must be stew.

1257
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,535
- It's definitely stew. - No.

1258
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:38,990
Haha made us change our minds.

1259
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:42,860
- Is he really our family? - That's right.

1260
00:44:42,861 --> 00:44:44,370
- Hey. - Okay. Think what you want.

1261
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:45,769
You can think what you want.

1262
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:48,094
He could be a spy.

1263
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,539
That's right.

1264
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,470
(What is Haha's secret?)

1265
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:54,237
- Haha could be the spy. - Someone among us is a spy.

1266
00:44:54,741 --> 00:44:56,280
(He is punished.)

1267
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:58,079
There's a hint he can't tell us?

1268
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,898
We're obviously not siblings...

1269
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,550
because we look so different.

1270
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:03,339
Some of us are too ugly while others look okay.

1271
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:04,919
My goodness.

1272
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,980
- Hey. - You're driving me crazy.

1273
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,979
Let me announce something.

1274
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,080
I'll always sit next to Jae Seok. No one can come here.

1275
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:14,430
(Next to Jae Seok, you suddenly look handsome.)

1276
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:15,714
You want to look handsome.

1277
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,890
Do you know what makes me really upset?

1278
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:20,793
When he said that, no one said anything.

1279
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:22,382
It makes me so upset.

1280
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:25,669
- You can win another hint. - Yes.

1281
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,640
This mission is...

1282
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:29,079
Blowing a Ping-pong Ball.

1283
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,030
(Blowing a Ping-pong Ball)

1284
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,379
Blow a ping-pong ball...

1285
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,472
over bottles turned upside down.

1286
00:45:34,551 --> 00:45:36,671
If you get the ball in the cup, you succeed.

1287
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:39,547
If the ball falls, the next player takes over.

1288
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:41,133
Is it even possible?

1289
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,332
How are we going to do it?

1290
00:45:42,891 --> 00:45:45,260
- Let's win a high hint with this. - Yes.

1291
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:46,559
We need a hint.

1292
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,247
Without it, we can't succeed.

1293
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,530
Jong Kook.

1294
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:52,126
(Jong Kook plays first.)

1295
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:54,290
- To the right... - We don't have much time.

1296
00:45:54,471 --> 00:45:55,955
Let me start.

1297
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:02,280
(Will Jong Kook succeed?)

1298
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:06,654
(To win a high hint, all of them have to succeed.)

1299
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:09,536
(Blowing)

1300
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:14,019
(The ball rolls over the bottles quickly.)

1301
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:15,102
(Bouncing)

1302
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:19,025
(The ball bounces off the brim of the cup.)

1303
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,399
Did it bounce off the cup?

1304
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,280
The cup must have been too close.

1305
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,700
Let's move the cup.

1306
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:25,711
(The cup is moved.)

1307
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:30,265
(It's farther away from the bottles now.)

1308
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:32,352
Start!

1309
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:37,349
Just give one strong puff.

1310
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,028
(Puff)

1311
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,277
(The ball rolls on.)

1312
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,761
- There you go. - That's it.

1313
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:46,702
It should have been stronger.

1314
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:50,689
(The ball falls where the cup used to be.)

1315
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,473
It should have been stronger.

1316
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:53,860
Should the cup be moved?

1317
00:46:53,861 --> 00:46:55,447
- It doesn't matter. - It has to move all the time.

1318
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,870
Like this. Okay.

1319
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:58,112
(So Min is the third player.)

1320
00:46:58,431 --> 00:47:00,692
(The cup is moved again.)

1321
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,759
(Blowing)

1322
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,686
(Rolling)

1323
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:10,715
(The ball bounces off the cup.)

1324
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,622
The cup was moved.

1325
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:15,880
But it depends on how strong you blow.

1326
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,649
- Let me try. - That was close.

1327
00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,610
- I should practice. - I've never tried it.

1328
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:21,220
Just give one strong puff.

1329
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,038
Get closer to the ball.

1330
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,104
You can do it.

1331
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,229
Start!

1332
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,805
(Will Ji Hyo succeed?)

1333
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,140
(The ball rolls over the bottles quickly.)

1334
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:36,970
(It just has to land now.)

1335
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:38,658
(It's in.)

1336
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:42,141
(Ji Hyo is the first person to succeed.)

1337
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,707
(Is there anything she's not good at?)

1338
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:48,180
- That's how you do it. - Ji Hyo is the best.

1339
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:49,320
She's an ace.

1340
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:50,789
- Who's next? - I'll go.

1341
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,436
- Who's next? - I'll go.

1342
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:54,031
I'll go.

1343
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,689
I'll go.

1344
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:58,629
(That jerk.)

1345
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:01,160
(It's an important moment to win a hint.)

1346
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:02,716
- Is this spot okay? - Okay.

1347
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,030
His mouth is crooked.

1348
00:48:06,031 --> 00:48:07,340
(He attacks him verbally.)

1349
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:08,669
(He tries to mess with him.)

1350
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,870
(Goodness)

1351
00:48:09,871 --> 00:48:11,110
- Isn't this... - What are you doing?

1352
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:12,370
a psychological warfare?

1353
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:14,379
(Is he a spy?)

1354
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,610
Stop it.

1355
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,327
- This is what you did. - My mouth is crooked?

1356
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:18,510
(He's not a team player.)

1357
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:20,419
- Why did you do that? - Come on.

1358
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,501
- It's fine as long as he can speak. - Goodness.

1359
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,316
Jae Seok, accept the truth.

1360
00:48:25,321 --> 00:48:26,550
Blow it straight.

1361
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:27,620
Start.

1362
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:28,689
(It's a real start this time.)

1363
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,074
- Start. - Wait.

1364
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:31,260
Okay, wait.

1365
00:48:31,261 --> 00:48:33,008
(He blows with his crooked mouth.)

1366
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:38,214
Okay, wait.

1367
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:40,169
(It rolls straight.)

1368
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,539
(It hits the cup and falls off.)

1369
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,319
Isn't this a success? Talk to them.

1370
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,576
(Isn't this a success? Talk to them.)

1371
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,550
(Shameless)

1372
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:51,561
Isn't it?

1373
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:52,720
It went in and out.

1374
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,149
Look at the replay.

1375
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,419
It went in and out. Take a look.

1376
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,411
Jae Seok.

1377
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,890
- You're depending on me a lot. - Talk to them.

1378
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:00,919
It felt great.

1379
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,234
Right? Talk to them.

1380
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,559
"You talk to them."

1381
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,629
(Will he negotiate?)

1382
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:05,890
- You should say it. - Jae Seok.

1383
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:07,275
The cup was knocked down.

1384
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,329
- Otherwise, the ball would be in. - Listen.

1385
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,070
It's common sense.

1386
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:13,700
If the force went from top to bottom...

1387
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,070
I love him when he's on my side.

1388
00:49:15,071 --> 00:49:17,640
- That's good. - As the force went this way,

1389
00:49:17,641 --> 00:49:19,269
- it got knocked down. - We know that.

1390
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,340
Isn't that correct?

1391
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:21,491
- It's correct. - Scientifically speaking?

1392
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:24,068
- Isn't it right? - Am I right or wrong?

1393
00:49:24,111 --> 00:49:25,192
It's common sense.

1394
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,450
Think about it. I'll convince them.

1395
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:29,579
- The cup was knocked down. - Give it to me.

1396
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,849
The cup was knocked down.

1397
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:32,720
It's the staff's mistake.

1398
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,559
If the ball hit the inside,

1399
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,720
I'll accept it.

1400
00:49:35,721 --> 00:49:37,329
- It hit the inside. - It did.

1401
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,402
It definitely did.

1402
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:41,650
(They analyze the video.)

1403
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:47,140
(The ball hits the inside and bounces off.)

1404
00:49:47,141 --> 00:49:48,269
It's considered a success.

1405
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,439
- See? We got it. - It hit the inside.

1406
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,653
That's right.

1407
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:54,739
(Other members are moved by Jong Kook.)

1408
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:56,140
(We'll show you too.)

1409
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:57,322
- That's good. - Nice.

1410
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:01,131
Okay.

1411
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,432
- You got it. - Okay.

1412
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,172
- Okay. - Our members do well.

1413
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,760
Currently, you won a low hint, and four people get to eat.

1414
00:50:09,761 --> 00:50:10,959
At least five of us should eat.

1415
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,789
If you succeed one more time,

1416
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:15,300
- Can six of us eat? - Yes and win a medium hint.

1417
00:50:15,301 --> 00:50:16,340
Okay.

1418
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,870
- Seok Jin. - Try it.

1419
00:50:17,871 --> 00:50:18,899
Okay.

1420
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,910
(The last player is Seok Jin.)

1421
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,599
Seok Jin is good at this.

1422
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,800
I'm nervous.

1423
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:23,870
(A medium hint is on the line.)

1424
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,951
Start.

1425
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:26,979
Start.

1426
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,304
(Will Seok Jin succeed?)

1427
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,572
(He blows it carefully.)

1428
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:34,950
(Will it go straight into the cup?)

1429
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:37,212
If you succeed one more time,

1430
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:39,774
you win a medium hint, and six of you can eat.

1431
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:41,737
(Bouncing)

1432
00:50:41,861 --> 00:50:42,860
(It goes in.)

1433
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:45,285
(Seok Jin wins.)

1434
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:48,860
(He becomes a hero.)

1435
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,129
- You're our big man. - This is my world.

1436
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,300
That was amazing.

1437
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:53,311
(He's the hope of the middle-aged.)

1438
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,370
That was amazing.

1439
00:50:55,371 --> 00:50:56,856
He seemed confident.

1440
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,570
If I had failed, you guys would've felt disheartened.

1441
00:50:58,571 --> 00:50:59,640
Of course.

1442
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:00,953
(They gain a medium hint and a meal for six.)

1443
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,780
(Who will be the unlucky 2 who can't eat?)

1444
00:51:04,781 --> 00:51:06,224
Pick two members who can't eat.

1445
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:07,932
Let's play Race of Wits.

1446
00:51:08,951 --> 00:51:11,450
(They select one unlucky person with Race of Wits.)

1447
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:12,864
- Start, 1. - 2.

1448
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,059
- Start, 1. - 2.

1449
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,070
Three.

1450
00:51:16,690 --> 00:51:18,459
- 4. - 5.

1451
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,571
- 6. - 6.

1452
00:51:20,431 --> 00:51:21,459
Okay.

1453
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,459
It's the three of them.

1454
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:24,700
(Either Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, or Seok Jin will be eliminated.)

1455
00:51:24,701 --> 00:51:26,169
Okay, we're safe.

1456
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,312
- We're okay. - Good job.

1457
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,070
I was ready.

1458
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:30,099
(I'm the hero.)

1459
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,990
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1460
00:51:32,471 --> 00:51:33,510
Okay.

1461
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:34,610
Rock-paper-scissors.

1462
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:35,910
(Ji Hyo loses.)

1463
00:51:35,911 --> 00:51:36,991
Okay.

1464
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,393
- Okay, you're out. - Ji Hyo can't eat?

1465
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:39,610
- I'm out. - You're out.

1466
00:51:39,611 --> 00:51:41,280
- You lost. - She's the last.

1467
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:43,450
- I accept it. - Pick one more person.

1468
00:51:43,451 --> 00:51:44,720
- It's six servings. - Right.

1469
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:45,731
One more person can't eat.

1470
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,220
- Pick one more. - Okay.

1471
00:51:47,221 --> 00:51:48,220
(How will they decide?)

1472
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:50,038
- How about... - Don't play Race of Wits.

1473
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:52,080
- Let's play it. - Stop it.

1474
00:51:52,431 --> 00:51:54,279
Let's stand up. Everyone, sit down.

1475
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:55,811
My goodness.

1476
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:57,068
Everyone, sit down comfortably.

1477
00:51:57,431 --> 00:51:58,844
You don't have to sit in one line.

1478
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:01,340
- Ji Hyo will call when to start. - I will.

1479
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:02,351
Okay.

1480
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,939
I'm always number one.

1481
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,082
I'm number two.

1482
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:07,057
Someone will get caught in the middle.

1483
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:09,157
Get ready.

- Ji Hyo will call when to start. - I will.

00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,189

1489
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,332
I'm number two.

1490
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:26,307
Someone will get caught in the middle.

1491

Get ready.

1492

Get ready.

1493
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:32,525
- Start. - One.

1494
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:33,634
- 3. - 4.

1495
00:52:33,635 --> 00:52:35,565
(It's chaotic.)

1496
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:36,565
(Goodness)

1497
00:52:36,566 --> 00:52:38,081
- 5. - 6.

1498
00:52:40,175 --> 00:52:41,674
You said six.

1499
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:42,674
Three.

1500
00:52:42,675 --> 00:52:44,904
- Gosh, 5. - 6.

1501
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:45,904
(His sound became number 5.)

1502
00:52:45,905 --> 00:52:47,057
I also said six.

1503
00:52:47,675 --> 00:52:49,594
- Did he? - I said six.

1504
00:52:49,686 --> 00:52:50,844
- You didn't. - Did you say six?

1505
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:52,114
- Five. - I think you said...

1506
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:53,569
- Five. - No.

1507
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:56,054
(Seok Jin loses.)

1508
00:52:56,055 --> 00:52:57,944
She got me on my nerves.

1509
00:52:58,856 --> 00:53:01,194
- It's over. - Seok Jin and Ji Hyo can't eat.

1510
00:53:01,195 --> 00:53:02,205
Okay.

1511
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:03,625
You're terrible.

1512
00:53:03,626 --> 00:53:04,676
(I knew today was going too well for me.)

1513
00:53:05,465 --> 00:53:07,165
(It's time for six members to eat steamed blue crabs.)

1514
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:08,681
It looks delicious.

1515
00:53:09,195 --> 00:53:11,534
- Look at the meat. - Listen.

1516
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:12,804
Look at the meat oozing out.

1517
00:53:12,805 --> 00:53:13,815
(It's packed with meat.)

1518
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,093
(Tasty)

1519
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,611
(They fill their mouths with in-season blue crabs.)

1520
00:53:21,945 --> 00:53:23,431
That looks delicious.

1521
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:26,614
How could this be?

1522
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:28,878
It was me who made two more people eat.

1523
00:53:30,026 --> 00:53:32,176
- What is it? - That looks amazing.

1524
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:35,255
(Blue crab is delicious.)

1525
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:36,266
It's delicious.

1526
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,194
Look at this.

1527
00:53:38,195 --> 00:53:39,395
(They're busy eating.)

1528
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:40,764
I want some too.

1529
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:43,362
(It's full of crab meat.)

1530
00:53:43,865 --> 00:53:44,935
(Give it to me.)

1531
00:53:44,936 --> 00:53:47,360
- Look at the steam rising. - Wait a minute.

1532
00:53:47,876 --> 00:53:49,234
(They start to fight for the crab.)

1533
00:53:49,235 --> 00:53:51,194
I didn't even get a spoon of it.

1534
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:53,229
(Look at Seok Jin.)

1535
00:53:53,276 --> 00:53:55,165
(He goes after the blue crab thief.)

1536
00:53:56,146 --> 00:53:58,206
(Pressing)

1537
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:00,976
I want to eat it.

1538
00:54:02,316 --> 00:54:05,154
(Why are they fighting above him?)

1539
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:08,168
Jong Kook is still eating.

1540
00:54:08,825 --> 00:54:10,078
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1541
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:11,610
I'm sorry, Jong Kook.

1542
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:14,386
- I'm sorry, Jong Kook. Wait. - I'm sorry.

1543
00:54:14,465 --> 00:54:15,606
Go and sit down.

1544
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:16,918
- I blocked him. - Okay.

1545
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:18,264
I'll eat.

1546
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:20,194
(It's so delicious that Jong Kook doesn't get upset.)

1547
00:54:20,405 --> 00:54:21,951
Take a look while eating.

1548
00:54:22,276 --> 00:54:23,745
- Here's your hint. - Okay.

1549
00:54:23,746 --> 00:54:24,904
We also have a hint.

1550
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:26,714
You get a medium hint thanks to Seok Jin.

1551
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,514
That's right. You should be grateful.

1552
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,727
This hint is quite important.

1553
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:30,984
Let's look carefully.

1554
00:54:30,985 --> 00:54:33,315
(Will they guess the answer with this hint?)

1555
00:54:33,316 --> 00:54:34,614
"There were bones."

1556
00:54:34,615 --> 00:54:36,878
(Third hint is "There were bones.")

1557
00:54:37,086 --> 00:54:38,525
- Something that was alive? - It lived underwater.

1558
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:39,554
Something alive?

1559
00:54:39,555 --> 00:54:42,355
"It was scary to touch it when I was young."

1560
00:54:42,356 --> 00:54:44,125
"But my mom touched it with ease."

1561
00:54:44,126 --> 00:54:45,377
(It's scary to touch.)

1562
00:54:45,526 --> 00:54:49,435
(And there were bones?)

1563
00:54:49,436 --> 00:54:51,051
It must have bones.

1564
00:54:51,206 --> 00:54:52,821
- If there are bones... - It must be gizzard shad.

1565
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:54,648
- Gizzard shad? - It's gizzard shad.

1566
00:54:54,675 --> 00:54:56,605
- It's definitely gizzard shad. - We eat its bones too.

1567
00:54:56,606 --> 00:54:57,686
That's right.

1568
00:54:58,006 --> 00:54:59,245
(They make their guesses.)

1569
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:00,327
(Looking around)

1570
00:55:01,646 --> 00:55:02,775
We should go and eat gizzard shad.

1571
00:55:02,776 --> 00:55:04,214
(Let's see.)

1572
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:06,943
What are you looking for?

1573
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:08,114
- What? - What are you looking for?

1574
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:10,074
I was wondering if there was anything.

1575
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:11,284
Let's see.

1576
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:12,324
(I almost forgot.)

1577
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:13,924
- There's something else. - There's nothing.

1578
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:15,054
Look on your plate.

1579
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:16,094
(Where's the secret mission this time?)

1580
00:55:16,095 --> 00:55:18,489
- I completely forgot. - It must be somewhere.

1581
00:55:19,026 --> 00:55:21,591
- I completely forgot. - It must be somewhere.

1582
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:26,534
(The secret mission...)

1583
00:55:26,535 --> 00:55:29,201
(goes to Kwang Soo.)

1584
00:55:29,436 --> 00:55:32,537
(Kwang Soo finds a hint on his plate.)

1585
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:35,847
(He hides it secretly as soon as he sees it.)

1586
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:41,712
(He makes a call like Haha did.)

1587
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:44,165
Hello?

1588
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:46,085
Is it Kwang Soo?

1589
00:55:46,086 --> 00:55:48,681
(Is this the secret that Haha received?)

1590
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:50,665
(He pretends not to know.)

1591
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,776
I choose you.

1592
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,534
That must be it.

1593
00:55:53,535 --> 00:55:56,404
(As secrets pile up, time keeps passing.)

1594
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:58,051
What was the hint again?

1595
00:55:58,235 --> 00:55:59,734
- "There were bones." - "There were bones."

1596
00:55:59,735 --> 00:56:00,804
It's gizzard shad.

1597
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:03,005
If it's in autumn and has bones, it's gizzard shad.

1598
00:56:03,006 --> 00:56:04,358
- That's it. - It lives underwater.

1599
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:05,574
- Grilled gizzard shad. - Grilled gizzard shad.

1600
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:06,815
It's grilled gizzard shad.

1601
00:56:06,816 --> 00:56:08,415
- Gizzard shad is grilled. - There's also sashimi.

1602
00:56:08,416 --> 00:56:10,315
It has bones in it too.

1603
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,884
- That's true. - You eat it straight.

1604
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:13,255
Right,

1605
00:56:13,256 --> 00:56:14,497
but gizzard shad is grilled.

1606
00:56:14,586 --> 00:56:16,625
- They say grilled gizzard shad... - It's gizzard shad.

1607
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:17,868
- is delicious. - Right.

1608
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:20,125
Let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

1609
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,125
- Grilled gizzard shad. - Grilled gizzard shad.

1610
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,670
(They decide on grilled gizzard shad.)

1611
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:24,025
Grilled gizzard shad?

1612
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,565
(Everyone is certain of grilled gizzard shad.)

1613
00:56:26,566 --> 00:56:27,995
(Is it the father's food for soul?)

1614
00:56:27,996 --> 00:56:29,106
Grilled gizzard shad?

1615
00:56:29,905 --> 00:56:32,734
- It's incorrect. - That's not nice.

1616
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:34,275
It's not grilled gizzard shad?

1617
00:56:34,276 --> 00:56:36,426
- What is it then? - It has bones?

1618
00:56:36,445 --> 00:56:40,114
Here's a mission to get additional hints. It's Magic Bowling.

1619
00:56:40,115 --> 00:56:41,288
(Magic Bowling is a mission to earn additional hints.)

1620
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:45,647
You line up 10 markers and roll a marble.

1621
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:49,819
It could either be a strike or spare as long as you knock them all out.

1622
00:56:50,086 --> 00:56:52,924
Four teams have to succeed, so let's pair up well.

1623
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:54,542
(If 4 teams succeed, they earn the best hint and all get to eat.)

1624
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:58,225
(Gizzard shad wasn't right, so this is their only option.)

1625
00:56:58,226 --> 00:56:59,364
- So Min. - Me?

1626
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,112
So Min and Seok Jin.

1627
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:03,234
- Seok Jin. - Let's go.

1628
00:57:03,235 --> 00:57:04,435
- Next team. - So Min.

1629
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:05,464
- So Min. - Yes.

1630
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,875
- Seok Jin and So Min. - Are you going first?

1631
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:08,592
Okay. Do we stand here?

1632
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:11,804
- It's So Min. - Looking good.

1633
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:13,844
Why was this placed here?

1634
00:57:13,845 --> 00:57:14,956
Good! No, it's good.

1635
00:57:15,476 --> 00:57:16,484
(She knocks down 3 out of 10 markers.)

1636
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:18,970
- Good. - That was good.

1637
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:21,984
(She hits the end.)

1638
00:57:21,985 --> 00:57:24,085
(They're not in a bad position to get a spare.)

1639
00:57:24,086 --> 00:57:25,554
Seok Jin can finish it.

1640
00:57:25,555 --> 00:57:26,824
- Seok Jin. - Good job.

1641
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:27,855
Please finish it off.

1642
00:57:27,856 --> 00:57:29,964
- I need more at the back. - I'm counting on you.

1643
00:57:29,965 --> 00:57:31,824
- You start back here. - It doesn't matter.

1644
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:34,234
- You can do it. - You just have to hit here.

1645
00:57:34,235 --> 00:57:35,812
- Just throw it. - Good luck.

1646
00:57:35,896 --> 00:57:37,565
- It looks good. - Good luck.

1647
00:57:37,566 --> 00:57:38,964
(Will Seok Jin get a spare?)

1648
00:57:38,965 --> 00:57:40,753
- Start. - Focus.

1649
00:57:40,805 --> 00:57:42,249
- Start. - Start.

1650
00:57:44,075 --> 00:57:45,691
(Just one?)

1651
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:48,665
Okay! I did it, right?

1652
00:57:49,246 --> 00:57:50,295
Start.

1653
00:57:50,715 --> 00:57:53,384
(He hit the marker on the outside.)

1654
00:57:53,385 --> 00:57:57,125
(The blue marker fell toward the middle and made the rest fall.)

1655
00:57:57,126 --> 00:57:59,585
(That was a spare.)

1656
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:00,855
You approve, right?

1657
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,472
- It fell and pushed the others. - It fell.

1658
00:58:02,526 --> 00:58:03,637
Okay. Yes!

1659
00:58:04,425 --> 00:58:05,824
Referee.

1660
00:58:05,825 --> 00:58:09,094
He's an ace member.

1661
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:10,751
Go. Ji Hyo?

1662
00:58:11,506 --> 00:58:14,001
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo are the second pair.)

1663
00:58:14,175 --> 00:58:17,741
(Ji Hyo goes first.)

1664
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:23,196
- Good! - Good.

1665
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,884
- That wasn't bad. - One.

1666
00:58:24,885 --> 00:58:25,884
That wasn't bad.

1667
00:58:25,885 --> 00:58:27,784
(Ace member Ji Hyo only knocks down 1.)

1668
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:31,455
(That's too bad.)

1669
00:58:31,456 --> 00:58:32,971
Good job.

1670
00:58:32,985 --> 00:58:35,420
It's better to stand far away, right?

1671
00:58:35,626 --> 00:58:37,525
Kwang Soo, you have to do this.

1672
00:58:37,526 --> 00:58:39,165
- I'll go. - Where's the start line?

1673
00:58:39,166 --> 00:58:40,165
(Gulping)

1674
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:42,791
(Did he just inhale the marble?)

1675
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:44,734
(His ready position is unusual.)

1676
00:58:44,735 --> 00:58:46,574
- Aim for the right one. - Can you hold my arms?

1677
00:58:46,575 --> 00:58:47,747
Okay.

1678
00:58:49,006 --> 00:58:50,074
Hold on.

1679
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:51,174
Why is he doing that?

1680
00:58:51,175 --> 00:58:52,287
He looks cool.

1681
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,796
He's going to launch.

1682
00:58:55,276 --> 00:58:57,133
- This looks really good. - He looks like a pufferfish.

1683
00:58:57,885 --> 00:58:59,114
He's a pufferfish.

1684
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:01,185
He looks like a hero.

1685
00:59:01,186 --> 00:59:03,384
This looks like "Transformers".

1686
00:59:03,385 --> 00:59:04,839
You'll be a hero if you do this.

1687
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:06,439
(You'll be a hero if you do this.)

1688
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,791
(Take aim...)

1689
00:59:10,566 --> 00:59:12,484
Okay!

1690
00:59:13,996 --> 00:59:15,854
- Okay! - Yes!

1691
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,185
- Great job. - That was a strike.

1692
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:19,516
That was perfect.

1693
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:20,875
- Okay. - That was excellent.

1694
00:59:20,876 --> 00:59:22,148
- We did it. - Did he do it?

1695
00:59:22,675 --> 00:59:24,594
- That was perfect. - I'm serious.

1696
00:59:25,276 --> 00:59:28,042
- Great job. - I knew it.

1697
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:30,984
- Great job. - Wait a minute. We have an issue.

1698
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:32,545
The cameraman said...

1699
00:59:32,546 --> 00:59:35,085
the markers fell before the marble touched it.

1700
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,284
- That's not right. - Really?

1701
00:59:36,285 --> 00:59:37,625
- Let's see it. - Rewind the tape.

1702
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:38,855
- Rewind it. - Hold on.

1703
00:59:38,856 --> 00:59:41,594
- It's because... - Jong Kook!

1704
00:59:41,595 --> 00:59:43,895
- Jong Kook! - Excuse me.

1705
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:45,895
Jong Kook!

1706
00:59:45,896 --> 00:59:47,795
- Tell them. - How's that possible?

1707
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:50,835
There's action and reaction. How can the markers fall first?

1708
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:52,105
I know. Rewind the tape.

1709
00:59:52,106 --> 00:59:53,275
No, I was mistaken.

1710
00:59:53,276 --> 00:59:54,605
Right.

1711
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,495
(He waves his hand.)

1712
00:59:56,976 --> 00:59:58,674
- All right! - All right!

1713
00:59:58,675 --> 00:59:59,775
- Okay. - Okay.

1714
00:59:59,776 --> 01:00:00,975
All right.

1715
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:03,713
- I understand. - He can be mistaken.

1716
01:00:04,285 --> 01:00:05,984
- Good. - Start.

1717
01:00:05,985 --> 01:00:07,471
(Se Chan and Jae Seok are the third pair.)

1718
01:00:09,785 --> 01:00:10,884
(Falling)

1719
01:00:10,885 --> 01:00:11,884
- Goodness. - What was that?

1720
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:13,612
You're incredible.

1721
01:00:15,296 --> 01:00:17,864
(Strike first...)

1722
01:00:17,865 --> 01:00:19,644
(and then bowl.)

1723
01:00:19,965 --> 01:00:21,634
How did you do that?

1724
01:00:21,635 --> 01:00:22,835
How did you do that?

1725
01:00:22,836 --> 01:00:25,088
- We didn't even push it. - Psychokinesis.

1726
01:00:25,106 --> 01:00:27,256
- It's windy. - It was the wind.

1727
01:00:27,535 --> 01:00:29,234
- Fail. - Leave it.

1728
01:00:29,235 --> 01:00:30,545
That was a fail.

1729
01:00:30,546 --> 01:00:31,844
- It's a fail. - It is.

1730
01:00:31,845 --> 01:00:33,444
- Our turn. - Last pair.

1731
01:00:33,445 --> 01:00:35,799
- Last one. I'm going to start. - Start.

1732
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:38,085
This won't be easy.

1733
01:00:38,086 --> 01:00:39,484
(They have to succeed to get a medium hint and let 6 people eat.)

1734
01:00:39,485 --> 01:00:40,769
Go.

1735
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:42,114
(What will the result be?)

1736
01:00:42,115 --> 01:00:43,125
There you go.

1737
01:00:43,126 --> 01:00:44,499
(What will the result be?)

1738
01:00:44,885 --> 01:00:46,098
There you go.

1739
01:00:49,356 --> 01:00:50,679
- All right! - I did it.

1740
01:00:51,796 --> 01:00:52,806
There you go.

1741
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:55,556
(It's a strike.)

1742
01:00:56,265 --> 01:00:59,335
(He put a spin on the marble.)

1743
01:00:59,336 --> 01:01:03,043
(It made a sharp turn and got a strike.)

1744
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:05,745
(This is the class of the ace member.)

1745
01:01:05,746 --> 01:01:07,174
- That was perfect. - Do I not get a turn?

1746
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,832
I don't get a turn, right?

1747
01:01:08,976 --> 01:01:10,884
That was it, right? That was precise.

1748
01:01:10,885 --> 01:01:13,255
That was faultless.

1749
01:01:13,256 --> 01:01:17,325
(All but Jae Seok and Se Chan get to eat the gizzard shad.)

1750
01:01:17,485 --> 01:01:19,625
You are supposed to eat it like this.

1751
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:22,120
- How do you eat this? - You eat the bones too.

1752
01:01:23,496 --> 01:01:25,183
- Try this. - It's good.

1753
01:01:25,796 --> 01:01:27,565
It's good.

1754
01:01:27,566 --> 01:01:29,835
- There you go. - So Min knows how to eat it.

1755
01:01:29,836 --> 01:01:31,220
Use your hands.

1756
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:34,005
- Eat the head first. - That's right.

1757
01:01:34,006 --> 01:01:35,335
You eat the head too?

1758
01:01:35,336 --> 01:01:37,105
(The head is very savory.)

1759
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:38,875
While you eat,

1760
01:01:38,876 --> 01:01:40,795
we'll give you the hint.

1761
01:01:41,175 --> 01:01:43,185
This is the medium hint.

1762
01:01:43,186 --> 01:01:45,014
You'll get the answer once you see this.

1763
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:46,014
Is that right?

1764
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:49,723
(They can hopefully get the answer with this hint.)

1765
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:52,637
What is it?

1766
01:01:53,356 --> 01:01:55,881
(Fourth hint)

1767
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:58,264
"Seok Jin reminds me of this."

1768
01:01:58,265 --> 01:01:59,709
(Fourth hint: Seok Jin reminds me of this.)

1769
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:03,942
(Seok Jin reminds me of this.)

1770
01:02:04,606 --> 01:02:11,745
(It lives in the water, and he's scared to touch it.)

1771
01:02:11,746 --> 01:02:18,484
(You can chew on the bones, and it's related to Seok Jin.)

1772
01:02:18,485 --> 01:02:19,755
What does Seok Jin remind you of?

1773
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,271
- Pollack! - That's right.

1774
01:02:22,356 --> 01:02:24,001
- Why? - His nose is big.

1775
01:02:24,086 --> 01:02:25,601
Anchovy.

1776
01:02:25,686 --> 01:02:28,824
Pollacks swim in the water and once you dry it,

1777
01:02:28,825 --> 01:02:30,594
you eat it.

1778
01:02:30,595 --> 01:02:31,808
You eat the whole thing, right?

1779
01:02:32,566 --> 01:02:33,594
Is it a pollack?

1780
01:02:33,595 --> 01:02:34,746
(He's not certain.)

1781
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,046
What is it?

1782
01:02:38,235 --> 01:02:39,364
Jamwon-dong loach.

1783
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:40,904
- A loach? - A loach.

1784
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:42,875
(A loach?)

1785
01:02:42,876 --> 01:02:45,645
(Last fall during Healing Race)

1786
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:48,949
(Seok Jin's nickname became "loach".)

1787
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,924
(He dodges around and avoids punishments.)

1788
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:56,355
Jamwon-dong loach. I mentioned it.

1789
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,025
- A long time ago? - I mentioned it.

1790
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,712
- Right. - Loach soup.

1791
01:03:00,956 --> 01:03:02,471
It's a loach soup.

1792
01:03:02,555 --> 01:03:03,764
You eat the bones too.

1793
01:03:03,765 --> 01:03:05,846
- Right. - That's right.

1794
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:08,264
It's scary to touch because it looks like a snake.

1795
01:03:08,265 --> 01:03:10,690
- That's right. - He said he can't touch it.

1796
01:03:11,336 --> 01:03:15,477
(Is loach soup the right answer?)

1797
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,375
- Let's get loach soup. - Let's go.

1798
01:03:18,376 --> 01:03:19,688
Loach soup!

1799
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:21,674
- Let's get loach soup. - Let's go.

1800
01:03:21,675 --> 01:03:22,844
Where do we go?

1801
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:25,014
- It's nearby. - There must be one nearby.

1802
01:03:25,015 --> 01:03:27,440
There must be one. There has to be a place.

1803
01:03:27,456 --> 01:03:29,585
Loach soup is eaten in the fall weather.

1804
01:03:29,586 --> 01:03:31,554
There it is.

1805
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:33,919
- It's here. - There's one.

1806
01:03:34,055 --> 01:03:35,995
Let's go. We just have to get it.

1807
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,915
Let's go.

1808
01:03:37,996 --> 01:03:39,364
- Okay. - Hello.

1809
01:03:39,365 --> 01:03:40,594
Hello.

1810
01:03:40,595 --> 01:03:43,065
(They had jumbo shrimps, blue crabs, and gizzard shad.)

1811
01:03:43,066 --> 01:03:44,364
I looked it up,

1812
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:47,904
and loach soup is eaten in the fall as nutritious food.

1813
01:03:47,905 --> 01:03:48,915
(Loach soup is eaten to replenish energy in the fall.)

1814
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:52,275
In 1, 2, 3.

1815
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:53,375
- Loach soup. - Loach soup.

1816
01:03:53,376 --> 01:03:54,992
(Was this the food their father was looking for?)

1817
01:03:56,075 --> 01:03:58,844
(It lives in the water,)

1818
01:03:58,845 --> 01:04:02,085
(and he was scared to touch it.)

1819
01:04:02,086 --> 01:04:05,025
(It also reminded him of Seok Jin.)

1820
01:04:05,026 --> 01:04:08,324
(Is loach soup correct?)

1821
01:04:08,325 --> 01:04:09,324
Correct.

1822
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:10,665
(Loach soup is correct.)

1823
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:11,705
Yes!

1824
01:04:12,095 --> 01:04:13,264
(Their father wanted to find the loach soup.)

1825
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,634
We did it the hard way.

1826
01:04:15,635 --> 01:04:17,065
- It's here. - Let's go.

1827
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:18,247
All right.

1828
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:19,875
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1829
01:04:19,876 --> 01:04:22,775
- Take care. - It's one serving.

1830
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,766
- Thank you. - Take care.

1831
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:29,074
(Museum in Oido)

1832
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:31,167
- Let's get it! - Go.

1833
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:32,884
- Do you have the loach soup? - Yes.

1834
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,501
Bring the loach soup.

1835
01:04:34,715 --> 01:04:36,384
- Bring it. - Loach soup.

1836
01:04:36,385 --> 01:04:37,725
Bring it.

1837
01:04:37,726 --> 01:04:40,483
Do we have to weep when we see Father?

1838
01:04:40,555 --> 01:04:42,313
Don't we have to bow?

1839
01:04:42,456 --> 01:04:44,587
Do we? It's been a while.

1840
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,364
(They're meeting him for the first time,)

1841
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:51,496
(but they missed him.)

1842
01:04:52,836 --> 01:04:54,005
(Finally...)

1843
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:55,005
- Oh, dear. - Father.

1844
01:04:55,006 --> 01:04:56,444
- Dad. - Father.

1845
01:04:56,445 --> 01:04:57,875
(The family reunites after decades.)

1846
01:04:57,876 --> 01:04:59,475
- Father. - Dad.

1847
01:04:59,476 --> 01:05:00,975
- Father. - Father!

1848
01:05:00,976 --> 01:05:02,545
- Father. - Father!

1849
01:05:02,546 --> 01:05:04,707
(They wanted to call him "father" in person.)

1850
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:06,835
- Great work. - Father.

1851
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:08,984
You work too hard, Father.

1852
01:05:08,985 --> 01:05:10,784
- She's... - So Min,

1853
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:12,685
- it's your dad. - Oh, my.

1854
01:05:12,686 --> 01:05:13,895
Father, you two look the same.

1855
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:16,225
- We found it. - Okay, let me see.

1856
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:18,044
- We found it. - We don't know if it's right.

1857
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:20,194
- What is it? - It's loach soup.

1858
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:21,812
- Is that what it is? - Yes.

1859
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,464
When I was young...

1860
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:29,687
(His mother made it for him every fall when he was young.)

1861
01:05:30,976 --> 01:05:36,500
(He never forgot the taste of it.)

1862
01:05:37,186 --> 01:05:38,257
Please take a look.

1863
01:05:39,385 --> 01:05:42,014
- Is this it? - It's loach soup. It's warm.

1864
01:05:42,015 --> 01:05:43,355
(Memories of his youth and of his mom...)

1865
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:48,824
(are contained in this bowl of loach soup.)

1866
01:05:48,825 --> 01:05:50,694
- Father... - Thank you.

1867
01:05:50,695 --> 01:05:53,998
I appreciate it very much. Great work.

1868
01:05:54,066 --> 01:05:55,795
Do you have some inheritance?

1869
01:05:55,796 --> 01:05:57,552
(He makes an inappropriate comment.)

1870
01:05:58,235 --> 01:05:59,565
(He switches the subject all of a sudden.)

1871
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:00,705
Goodness.

1872
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:01,835
Why are you so materialistic?

1873
01:06:01,836 --> 01:06:03,475
I thought you were leaving us your inheritance.

1874
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:04,475
I already told you.

1875
01:06:04,476 --> 01:06:05,859
(He's creepy.)

1876
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:09,444
(Seok Jin must have forgotten...)

1877
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:13,799
(who he used to be.)

1878
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:17,125
- I told you I would, so I will. - I know.

1879
01:06:17,126 --> 01:06:18,585
- You should know. - Are you kidding me?

1880
01:06:18,586 --> 01:06:19,636
My apologies.

1881
01:06:20,296 --> 01:06:21,811
He's scary.

1882
01:06:22,526 --> 01:06:24,065
(Isn't our father a businessman?)

1883
01:06:24,066 --> 01:06:26,634
Is our father a gangster?

1884
01:06:26,635 --> 01:06:28,764
(He's not into killing people, right?)

1885
01:06:28,765 --> 01:06:31,997
- What are you saying? - Father.

1886
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:33,435
He doesn't watch his mouth.

1887
01:06:33,436 --> 01:06:34,850
I don't know what his occupation is.

1888
01:06:35,106 --> 01:06:37,025
I don't know what it is.

1889
01:06:37,075 --> 01:06:38,389
- Come here. - Fine.

1890
01:06:38,646 --> 01:06:39,685
Hey.

1891
01:06:39,776 --> 01:06:41,674
Great job.

1892
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:43,245
As I promised...

1893
01:06:43,246 --> 01:06:44,645
(Anyhow...)

1894
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:45,828
I'll leave you...

1895
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:47,869
- my entire asset. - Thank you.

1896
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:48,955
However,

1897
01:06:48,956 --> 01:06:50,725
I left it...

1898
01:06:50,726 --> 01:06:52,755
(The asset is on the 3rd floor!)

1899
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:54,008
- On the 3rd floor. - 3rd floor?

1900
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:55,154
Third floor?

1901
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:56,565
When I say "start",

1902
01:06:56,566 --> 01:06:58,484
- you go. - Okay.

1903
01:06:58,595 --> 01:07:00,364
Get ready...

1904
01:07:00,365 --> 01:07:03,194
(The asset is divided in the order of arrival.)

1905
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:05,904
(The person who arrives first...)

1906
01:07:05,905 --> 01:07:08,532
(can get the most amount.)

1907
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:10,574
(Which of the 8 siblings will get the most amount of money?)

1908
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:11,818
- Go. - Okay, let's go.

1909
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:13,956
Go.

1910
01:07:14,575 --> 01:07:17,514
(There's no family when it comes to money.)

1911
01:07:18,516 --> 01:07:21,515
(I'm going to take more.)

1912
01:07:22,155 --> 01:07:25,964
(While the others fight, Jong Kook gets ahead.)

1913
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:28,548
Look carefully.

1914
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:31,394
- I can't catch up. - Where is it?

1915
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:32,536
(They sprint for the money.)

1916
01:07:35,895 --> 01:07:38,663
(At that moment!)

1917
01:07:39,876 --> 01:07:43,642
(Haha takes a different route.)

1918
01:07:44,775 --> 01:07:47,814
(He hides while the other 7 siblings are in a mess.)

1919
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,461
Should we try again?

1920
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:51,415
(While they were eating jumbo shrimps,)

1921
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,677
(Haha found something on the bottom of his plate.)

1922
01:07:54,956 --> 01:07:56,844
(Looking around)

1923
01:07:57,586 --> 01:07:59,824
(He called the number...)

1924
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:03,502
(on the plate.)

1925
01:08:03,966 --> 01:08:06,194
(He heard the voice...)

1926
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:09,094
(and was shocked.)

1927
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,064
(It wasn't just Haha.)

1928
01:08:12,065 --> 01:08:13,287
(He puts something away.)

1929
01:08:13,876 --> 01:08:17,209
(Kwang Soo was stunned as well.)

1930
01:08:17,575 --> 01:08:19,005
I'm okay.

1931
01:08:19,006 --> 01:08:21,474
- Go. Go. - Are you all right?

1932
01:08:21,475 --> 01:08:23,870
(Is that why? Kwang Soo is not running.)

1933
01:08:24,846 --> 01:08:26,215
(Jong Kook arrives first.)

1934
01:08:26,216 --> 01:08:27,326
What's this?

1935
01:08:28,056 --> 01:08:31,216
(As their father said, his entire asset is on 3rd floor.)

1936
01:08:31,725 --> 01:08:33,024
(Wig, glasses, letter,)

1937
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:35,694
(and a picture frame that's flipped over)

1938
01:08:35,695 --> 01:08:37,989
(Is this his entire asset?)

1939
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:40,864
What is it?

1940
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:41,864
(He reads the letter first.)

1941
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:43,885
- What is it? - "Hello, my sons and daughters."

1942
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:46,834
"I've been doing business abroad, so I didn't care of you all."

1943
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,534
"The oldest son of the nine siblings is missing."

1944
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,687
"He's Byung Ok".

1945
01:08:51,676 --> 01:08:53,774
(It's 9 siblings, not 8?)

1946
01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:54,825
- I'm getting goosebumps. - What?

1947
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:56,814
(We weren't 8 siblings?)

1948
01:08:56,815 --> 01:08:57,856
Byung Ok is the oldest sibling.

1949
01:08:57,945 --> 01:09:00,177
"The oldest son of the nine siblings is missing."

1950
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,426
- I'm getting goosebumps. - What?

1951
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,036
Byung Ok is the oldest sibling.

1952
01:09:03,155 --> 01:09:04,324
Hold on.

1953
01:09:04,325 --> 01:09:05,484
Byung Ok is the oldest sibling?

1954
01:09:05,485 --> 01:09:06,925
(We had a big brother?)

1955
01:09:06,926 --> 01:09:09,095
Look carefully.

1956
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:10,995
(So he's not their father.)

1957
01:09:10,996 --> 01:09:12,683
(Is he their brother Byung Ok?)

1958
01:09:12,996 --> 01:09:14,034
Hello?

1959
01:09:14,035 --> 01:09:15,064
(He sent the secret message.)

1960
01:09:15,065 --> 01:09:16,165
Is this Haha?

1961
01:09:16,166 --> 01:09:18,434
(He's the one who called them.)

1962
01:09:18,435 --> 01:09:19,688
I'm actually...

1963
01:09:19,876 --> 01:09:21,505
your older brother Byung Ok.

1964
01:09:21,506 --> 01:09:23,728
(He was their brother!)

1965
01:09:24,546 --> 01:09:25,616
You're our brother?

1966
01:09:26,376 --> 01:09:27,644
- Let me see. - Byung Ok is the oldest sibling?

1967
01:09:27,645 --> 01:09:29,114
"1st picnic with the 9 siblings".

1968
01:09:29,115 --> 01:09:32,116
(They had a brother!)

1969
01:09:32,615 --> 01:09:34,474
Byung Ok is our brother.

1970
01:09:34,516 --> 01:09:36,171
- He's not our father. - Really?

1971
01:09:37,086 --> 01:09:40,126
(This is not the end.)

1972
01:09:40,825 --> 01:09:44,265
(The wig and glasses next to the photo...)

1973
01:09:44,266 --> 01:09:48,934
(were what he used to look like their father.)

1974
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,219
(They were completely fooled.)

1975
01:09:51,035 --> 01:09:53,175
(Why did their brother...)

1976
01:09:53,176 --> 01:09:55,234
(do this?)

1977
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:57,774
(For what?)

1978
01:09:57,775 --> 01:10:04,350
(He lied to his siblings and plotted this.)

1979
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:08,811
- So then? - He's not our father.

1980
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,085
He's our oldest brother.

1981
01:10:10,086 --> 01:10:11,484
He pretended to be our father.

1982
01:10:11,485 --> 01:10:12,637
Hold on. Where is he?

1983
01:10:12,956 --> 01:10:14,095
Where is Byung Ok?

1984
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:15,694
(He lied to his siblings and won over Haha and Kwang Soo.)

1985
01:10:15,695 --> 01:10:18,494
I'm actually your older brother Byung Ok.

1986
01:10:18,725 --> 01:10:20,312
You're our brother, not our father?

1987
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:23,604
Yes, we were 9 siblings, not 8.

1988
01:10:23,605 --> 01:10:24,918
(What was he trying to achieve?)

1989
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:28,468
I know a way you can take all the asset.

1990
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:31,528
Don't tell the others.

1991
01:10:31,846 --> 01:10:33,260
Just follow me.

1992
01:10:33,615 --> 01:10:34,715
Do you understand?

1993
01:10:34,716 --> 01:10:36,231
(The older brother knew!)

1994
01:10:36,546 --> 01:10:37,596
All right.

1995
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:39,345
I thought you were our father.

1996
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:40,455
(Haha and Kwang Soo joined the scheme.)

1997
01:10:40,456 --> 01:10:41,455
Okay.

1998
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:43,172
(They were blinded by greed.)

1999
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:48,425
If you find it first,

2000
01:10:48,426 --> 01:10:51,625
you get more money. Those who find it first.

2001
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,564
(He pretended to be their father and left with the loach soup.)

2002
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:54,665
Hold on.

2003
01:10:54,666 --> 01:10:57,064
(Kwang Soo followed him quietly.)

2004
01:10:57,065 --> 01:11:00,734
(So did Haha.)

2005
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:02,604
Father, where do I go?

2006
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:05,030
(Is there another traitor?)

2007
01:11:06,246 --> 01:11:08,314
(He also won over Ji Hyo...)

2008
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:11,476
(out of the 8 siblings!)

2009
01:11:12,246 --> 01:11:16,224
(She found the message under the gizzard shad!)

2010
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:19,055
(She hides it...)

2011
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:21,015
(before the others see it.)

2012
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:26,369
(Even Ji Hyo betrayed the others to take all the asset!)

2013
01:11:26,395 --> 01:11:28,556
- You're scary people. - Is this happening again?

2014
01:11:28,836 --> 01:11:29,904
What's going on?

2015
01:11:29,905 --> 01:11:31,017
We got the same message, right?

2016
01:11:31,065 --> 01:11:32,682
I think we did.

2017
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:34,074
But where's Haha?

2018
01:11:34,075 --> 01:11:35,534
Haha, Ji Hyo,

2019
01:11:35,535 --> 01:11:36,758
and Kwang Soo are gone.

2020
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:39,198
They probably know by now.

2021
01:11:39,306 --> 01:11:41,274
The oldest brother snatched your father's food,

2022
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:42,675
and he's trying to take all the asset.

2023
01:11:42,676 --> 01:11:45,473
If they find the hidden materials and successfully parcel the food,

2024
01:11:45,645 --> 01:11:48,715
Team Big Brother wins, and they take the money.

2025
01:11:48,716 --> 01:11:51,856
If you rip their name tags before that,

2026
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:54,347
you can remove their names from the family register.

2027
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:57,657
If you succeed, you will get to share the asset,

2028
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:59,644
and Team Big Brother will get the punishment.

2029
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:02,485
- You can start chasing them. - Okay!

2030
01:12:02,565 --> 01:12:04,104
Follow them.

2031
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:05,278
We just have to rip their name tags, right?

2032
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:08,330
It's been a while. I'll do this properly.

2033
01:12:09,376 --> 01:12:10,644
Let's hurry. Let's just go.

2034
01:12:10,645 --> 01:12:13,415
(They arrive at the park that has the box, tape, and an invoice.)

2035
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,515
Let's go.

2036
01:12:14,516 --> 01:12:15,859
- Let's go. - Go.

2037
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:17,415
Run.

2038
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,960
Where do we start?

2039
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:22,212
This place looks like a plain.

2040
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:25,984
- Where do we go? - I think we should...

2041
01:12:25,985 --> 01:12:27,237
- look into each room. - What?

2042
01:12:27,655 --> 01:12:28,795
There's nothing here.

2043
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:32,331
(They start searching right away.)

2044
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:33,995
Look here too!

2045
01:12:33,996 --> 01:12:35,309
(Let's find this fast!)

2046
01:12:37,605 --> 01:12:38,818
Where...

2047
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:40,587
Where are they going?

2048
01:12:41,735 --> 01:12:44,404
(He has a huge scheme, but he doesn't have any energy.)

2049
01:12:44,405 --> 01:12:45,557
Where is this?

2050
01:12:47,475 --> 01:12:48,828
Where's Kwang Soo?

2051
01:12:49,176 --> 01:12:50,296
- I'm here. - Hey.

2052
01:12:50,815 --> 01:12:52,330
Where do I go?

2053
01:12:53,086 --> 01:12:55,035
- We have to look. - Where...

2054
01:12:55,086 --> 01:12:57,354
You have to look, Byung Ok!

2055
01:12:57,355 --> 01:12:58,385
(Toddling)

2056
01:12:58,386 --> 01:12:59,555
You have to look.

2057
01:12:59,556 --> 01:13:01,616
Stop walking around.

2058
01:13:02,056 --> 01:13:03,378
You have to find the box.

2059
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:04,575
The invoice too.

2060
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:06,165
It's here somewhere?

2061
01:13:06,166 --> 01:13:07,882
(He's tired. Where is this?)

2062
01:13:09,336 --> 01:13:10,505
(They have to find a box, tape, and an invoice.)

2063
01:13:10,506 --> 01:13:12,454
- What do we do? - Tape.

2064
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:14,034
Where is this?

2065
01:13:14,035 --> 01:13:15,835
- I found the box. - Did you?

2066
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:19,411
(At that moment! They find the box.)

2067
01:13:19,676 --> 01:13:20,845
Did you?

2068
01:13:20,846 --> 01:13:21,944
(They find 1 out of 3 items before Team Siblings arrives.)

2069
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:23,602
- The box. - Did you find it?

2070
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:26,955
- Let's go. Tape. - What?

2071
01:13:26,956 --> 01:13:28,354
Tape.

2072
01:13:28,355 --> 01:13:30,547
(They only have 2 items left. Tape and invoice!)

2073
01:13:31,985 --> 01:13:33,894
(She finds tape!)

2074
01:13:33,895 --> 01:13:35,168
Byung Ok.

2075
01:13:35,825 --> 01:13:37,442
Hey, we just have to find the invoice.

2076
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,595
The invoice?

2077
01:13:38,596 --> 01:13:39,734
That's all we have to find?

2078
01:13:39,735 --> 01:13:41,110
Hey, hey.

2079
01:13:41,735 --> 01:13:43,553
- We're here. - Let's go. Come on.

2080
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,248
Those guys...

2081
01:13:45,636 --> 01:13:46,734
Let's go.

2082
01:13:46,735 --> 01:13:48,795
- Run. - Go, go. Move.

2083
01:13:48,876 --> 01:13:50,144
Where are these punks?

2084
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:51,404
(We'll teach you what you pay for being a traitor.)

2085
01:13:51,405 --> 01:13:53,314
- Kwang Soo! - Run.

2086
01:13:53,315 --> 01:13:54,515
Ji Hyo!

2087
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:55,959
(We'll rip your name tags and take the asset.)

2088
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:58,444
They're here.

2089
01:13:58,445 --> 01:13:59,495
(They're here!)

2090
01:13:59,785 --> 01:14:01,473
- Are they? - They're already here.

2091
01:14:01,485 --> 01:14:02,769
Byung Ok!

2092
01:14:02,785 --> 01:14:03,955
- Kwang Soo. - Where?

2093
01:14:03,956 --> 01:14:05,154
- There they are. - What?

2094
01:14:05,155 --> 01:14:06,337
Let's go. I spotted them right away.

2095
01:14:07,256 --> 01:14:08,354
There they are.

2096
01:14:08,355 --> 01:14:09,864
(Those who are trying to rip name tags)

2097
01:14:09,865 --> 01:14:11,512
Jae Seok.

2098
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:15,095
(He hides behind the mud hut.)

2099
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:16,246
It was him, right?

2100
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:22,604
(Team Siblings is closing in.)

2101
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:23,717
Where did they go?

2102
01:14:24,945 --> 01:14:26,175
I'm a spy.

2103
01:14:26,176 --> 01:14:28,375
(He tries to trick them.)

2104
01:14:28,376 --> 01:14:29,486
I'm serious.

2105
01:14:29,516 --> 01:14:30,597
I swear.

2106
01:14:30,785 --> 01:14:32,314
Hey! So Min.

2107
01:14:32,315 --> 01:14:34,154
(He runs away while Se Chan is off-guard.)

2108
01:14:34,155 --> 01:14:35,327
What's that box?

2109
01:14:36,426 --> 01:14:37,755
(It's difficult to catch people in this vast meadow.)

2110
01:14:37,756 --> 01:14:38,824
Haha.

2111
01:14:38,825 --> 01:14:40,168
Haha!

2112
01:14:40,456 --> 01:14:42,224
(He runs away.)

2113
01:14:42,225 --> 01:14:44,564
(Or not!)

2114
01:14:44,565 --> 01:14:47,928
(Tiger is the king of the meadow.)

2115
01:14:49,065 --> 01:14:51,135
(Haha was running in the meadow fearlessly.)

2116
01:14:51,136 --> 01:14:53,734
(He's out.)

2117
01:14:53,735 --> 01:14:55,705
- Who else is there? - Kwang Soo.

2118
01:14:55,706 --> 01:14:58,005
(Remaining Team Big Brother: Byung Ok, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo)

2119
01:14:58,006 --> 01:14:59,175
That was so scary.

2120
01:14:59,176 --> 01:15:01,165
(He's frightened.)

2121
01:15:01,615 --> 01:15:02,745
Oh, dear. Goodness.

2122
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:04,915
(Is he human or a tiger?)

2123
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:06,774
Then let's...

2124
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,255
What's this?

2125
01:15:09,256 --> 01:15:10,585
- Here. - No, what are you doing?

2126
01:15:10,586 --> 01:15:11,784
- Catch Ji Hyo. - Byung Ok!

2127
01:15:11,785 --> 01:15:13,255
- Take this. - Okay.

2128
01:15:13,256 --> 01:15:15,074
(Ji Hyo is out as well.)

2129
01:15:15,355 --> 01:15:16,524
Get Byung Ok.

2130
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:18,795
(Byung Ok is running at full speed.)

2131
01:15:18,796 --> 01:15:20,008
He can't get away.

2132
01:15:20,136 --> 01:15:21,308
No! Hey.

2133
01:15:21,395 --> 01:15:22,434
Tape.

2134
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,284
(He runs as fast as he can.)

2135
01:15:24,806 --> 01:15:28,138
(He was going to take all the asset, but he's out.)

2136
01:15:28,506 --> 01:15:29,545
It's over.

2137
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:32,045
Jae Seok.

2138
01:15:32,046 --> 01:15:33,215
- Come here. - Hey.

2139
01:15:33,216 --> 01:15:34,388
- Come here. - Jae Seok.

2140
01:15:34,445 --> 01:15:35,644
- Hey. - Jae Seok.

2141
01:15:35,645 --> 01:15:36,757
Does this make sense?

2142
01:15:37,185 --> 01:15:39,284
- How can you do this to us? - Well...

2143
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,033
- Of course I can. Why not? - No...

2144
01:15:41,685 --> 01:15:42,915
- How? - Still,

2145
01:15:42,916 --> 01:15:44,501
I'm sorry.

2146
01:15:44,785 --> 01:15:46,099
- But... - Give me the tape.

2147
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:47,524
Hey!

2148
01:15:47,525 --> 01:15:48,694
Get him.

2149
01:15:48,695 --> 01:15:49,807
He went this way.

2150
01:15:49,966 --> 01:15:51,076
Kwang Soo.

2151
01:15:51,996 --> 01:15:56,379
(He has to trust Kwang Soo now.)

2152
01:15:56,806 --> 01:15:58,149
Get Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo?

2153
01:15:58,766 --> 01:15:59,987
Is he the only one left?

2154
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:01,904
Hold on. Where did he go?

2155
01:16:01,905 --> 01:16:03,117
(Where did Kwang Soo go?)

2156
01:16:04,046 --> 01:16:05,692
I just have to find the invoice.

2157
01:16:06,046 --> 01:16:08,974
(He's struggling by himself to find the invoice.)

2158
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:13,184
(There's a white paper in the woods.)

2159
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:16,481
(He found the invoice!)

2160
01:16:16,926 --> 01:16:18,654
I found it.

2161
01:16:18,655 --> 01:16:20,847
(He acquired all items.)

2162
01:16:21,395 --> 01:16:24,425
(He just has to bring the loach soup to the parcel office!)

2163
01:16:24,426 --> 01:16:25,536
Where is he?

2164
01:16:25,695 --> 01:16:27,282
Where are you, Kwang Soo?

2165
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,746
Oh, gosh.

2166
01:16:29,296 --> 01:16:30,781
Where did he go?

2167
01:16:32,735 --> 01:16:34,250
Why is the path so winding?

2168
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:37,345
(Let's hide and rest.)

2169
01:16:37,346 --> 01:16:38,944
Get down. Get down.

2170
01:16:38,945 --> 01:16:40,015
(Don't let them find you.)

2171
01:16:40,016 --> 01:16:41,086
Get down.

2172
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,684
Where did he go?

2173
01:16:45,685 --> 01:16:47,705
(Where is the traitor?)

2174
01:16:48,655 --> 01:16:51,955
(Jae Seok comes near Kwang Soo's hiding place.)

2175
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:53,269
Kwang Soo is the last one.

2176
01:16:54,796 --> 01:16:57,855
(Jae Seok's voice is near.)

2177
01:16:59,195 --> 01:17:02,225
(Jae Seok's heavy breath approaches.)

2178
01:17:03,065 --> 01:17:04,705
(Before he gets nearer,)

2179
01:17:04,706 --> 01:17:07,034
(I must run away.)

2180
01:17:07,035 --> 01:17:08,045
There he is!

2181
01:17:08,235 --> 01:17:09,922
- There he is! - Catch him!

2182
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,574
(Does he have enough energy to lose the determined Jae Seok...)

2183
01:17:14,575 --> 01:17:17,374
(after finding the invoice?)

2184
01:17:19,046 --> 01:17:20,904
Why is the path so winding?

2185
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:23,755
My goodness.

2186
01:17:23,756 --> 01:17:26,786
(The members close in on him from all sides.)

2187
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,694
(The only way out is another uphill path.)

2188
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:31,514
(Kwang Soo is dying.)

2189
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:35,095
(Kwang Soo moves further away from the camera.)

2190
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:36,278
Don't go that way!

2191
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:37,917
Kwang Soo!

2192
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:39,875
(I can't go further. I am sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2193
01:17:39,876 --> 01:17:40,886
Kwang Soo!

2194
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:42,489
- Don't go that way. - Go back.

2195
01:17:43,275 --> 01:17:44,921
I will run until I reach the end of the earth.

2196
01:17:47,876 --> 01:17:49,361
Bye, viewers.

2197
01:17:55,416 --> 01:17:56,625
Where did he go?

2198
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:58,085
(He loses Kwang Soo.)

2199
01:17:58,086 --> 01:17:59,711
- Se Chan. - Yes?

2200
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:01,209
- Did you catch Kwang Soo? - We lost him.

2201
01:18:02,756 --> 01:18:04,194
Gosh, Kwang Soo ran until the end.

2202
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:05,194
(I can't believe he left without the cameraman.)

2203
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:06,447
He would do that.

2204
01:18:07,035 --> 01:18:08,064
There is no path.

2205
01:18:08,065 --> 01:18:10,135
(They don't see Kwang Soo anywhere.)

2206
01:18:10,136 --> 01:18:11,549
Will he take the mountain path?

2207
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:20,175
(Kwang Soo and the cameraman manage to reunite.)

2208
01:18:20,176 --> 01:18:21,458
I just need to find it.

2209
01:18:21,546 --> 01:18:24,284
(After losing Team Siblings,)

2210
01:18:24,285 --> 01:18:28,053
(he took a long way around.)

2211
01:18:29,886 --> 01:18:34,238
(He just needs to go to the parcel office.)

2212
01:18:35,056 --> 01:18:36,154
Father.

2213
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:37,824
(Is he suddenly acting?)

2214
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:39,077
It's your favorite dish,

2215
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:41,177
loach soup.

2216
01:18:42,365 --> 01:18:43,749
I will be sure...

2217
01:18:45,506 --> 01:18:47,021
to send it to you...

2218
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:49,488
while it's still warm.

2219
01:18:53,075 --> 01:18:54,515
(He just needs to go to the parcel office...)

2220
01:18:54,516 --> 01:18:56,636
(to inherit the asset and become a good son.)

2221
01:18:57,246 --> 01:18:59,644
- We should go in and look. - Where?

2222
01:18:59,645 --> 01:19:00,654
(Team Siblings spread out to find Kwang Soo.)

2223
01:19:00,655 --> 01:19:02,200
For goodness' sake. Where is Kwang Soo?

2224
01:19:02,855 --> 01:19:05,309
(This is the opportunity.)

2225
01:19:05,825 --> 01:19:08,149
We need to catch him before he goes to the parcel office.

2226
01:19:08,325 --> 01:19:09,365
That's right.

2227
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:11,524
(Without getting caught,)

2228
01:19:11,525 --> 01:19:15,000
(he arrives near the parcel office.)

2229
01:19:16,065 --> 01:19:19,438
(He is close to inheriting the entire asset.)

2230
01:19:21,535 --> 01:19:23,074
Where is he?

2231
01:19:23,075 --> 01:19:24,144
(They have no idea Kwang Soo is so close.)

2232
01:19:24,145 --> 01:19:26,640
He must be in the woods.

2233
01:19:27,216 --> 01:19:28,962
(Where is Kwang Soo?)

2234
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:30,958
So Min is coming.

2235
01:19:31,586 --> 01:19:32,625
So Min is coming.

2236
01:19:32,746 --> 01:19:36,215
(To avoid So Min,)

2237
01:19:36,216 --> 01:19:38,205
(he decides to go around.)

2238
01:19:39,456 --> 01:19:40,995
(I bet no one is on this side.)

2239
01:19:40,996 --> 01:19:42,137
Now!

2240
01:19:45,565 --> 01:19:46,835
What? What?

2241
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:47,906
(Jae Seok and a cameraman suddenly appear.)

2242
01:19:48,565 --> 01:19:50,252
(A cameraman yells, "Now!")

2243
01:19:51,235 --> 01:19:53,074
(With the help of a cameraman,)

2244
01:19:53,075 --> 01:19:54,835
(Jae Seok gets Kwang Soo.)

2245
01:19:54,836 --> 01:19:56,135
What? What?

2246
01:19:56,136 --> 01:20:00,144
(Kwang Soo didn't expect a sudden attack.)

2247
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:01,227
- What? - Now!

2248
01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:02,375
Okay!

2249
01:20:02,376 --> 01:20:04,644
(This cameraman looks familiar for some reason.)

2250
01:20:04,645 --> 01:20:06,885
(He isn't a cameraman, but Se Chan.)

2251
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:09,614
- Okay. - We got Kwang Soo.

2252
01:20:09,615 --> 01:20:10,736
(Let's see how this happened.)

2253
01:20:11,325 --> 01:20:12,537
I should hide.

2254
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:15,524
The color of my outfit stands out too much.

2255
01:20:15,525 --> 01:20:17,212
(He decided to be discreet.)

2256
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:21,265
(By taking off his top...)

2257
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:22,635
Stay here.

2258
01:20:22,636 --> 01:20:25,534
(and holding a camera,)

2259
01:20:25,535 --> 01:20:28,131
(Se Chan became a cameraman.)

2260
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:30,574
Go forward.

2261
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:33,614
(He told Jae Seok where to stand...)

2262
01:20:33,615 --> 01:20:35,274
(and when to attack.)

2263
01:20:35,275 --> 01:20:36,497
Kwang Soo!

2264
01:20:36,685 --> 01:20:37,715
Now!

2265
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:41,814
(Se Chan outsmarted Kwang Soo!)

2266
01:20:41,815 --> 01:20:42,897
Good job, Se Chan.

2267
01:20:44,525 --> 01:20:45,684
(I can't believe I got caught.)

2268
01:20:45,685 --> 01:20:47,295
I was so close to the parcel office.

2269
01:20:47,296 --> 01:20:48,335
This is the parcel office.

2270
01:20:48,756 --> 01:20:50,665
You shouldn't have been so greedy.

2271
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,024
Don't live that way.

2272
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:54,085
(His dream of inheriting the asset gets ruined.)

2273
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:59,364
The final winner of the delicacy of autumn,

2274
01:20:59,365 --> 01:21:00,675
Go, Determined Gourmet is...

2275
01:21:00,676 --> 01:21:01,734
Team Siblings.

2276
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:02,734
Yes!

2277
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:03,845
- Seriously. - We did a good job.

2278
01:21:03,846 --> 01:21:05,391
It feels good to defeat the evil.

2279
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:08,515
Since Team Siblings won, the members will get...

2280
01:21:08,516 --> 01:21:11,944
- an equal share of the asset. - What are we getting?

2281
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,284
What is the asset?

2282
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,354
The asset your father left behind...

2283
01:21:16,355 --> 01:21:18,708
is the fruit of autumn, dried persimmon.

2284
01:21:19,185 --> 01:21:20,425
- Is that the asset? - I like it.

2285
01:21:20,426 --> 01:21:22,577
- I like dried persimmon. It's good. - I like it as well,

2286
01:21:22,756 --> 01:21:24,125
but it's too humble to be the asset.

2287
01:21:24,126 --> 01:21:25,641
It's too fresh to be the asset.

2288
01:21:26,435 --> 01:21:30,005
Dried persimmon is the father's second favorite food.

2289
01:21:30,006 --> 01:21:31,705
- Dried persimmon is delicious. - Seriously.

2290
01:21:31,706 --> 01:21:33,393
(Loach soup and dried persimmon are Father's favorite food.)

2291
01:21:35,136 --> 01:21:37,545
Byung Ok, you worked hard.

2292
01:21:37,546 --> 01:21:38,604
Get the penalty before you go.

2293
01:21:38,605 --> 01:21:40,144
(That's what you get for working hard.)

2294
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,175
- Okay. - Does he need to get the penalty?

2295
01:21:41,176 --> 01:21:42,545
- Of course. - The thing is...

2296
01:21:42,546 --> 01:21:46,114
I am willing to receive the penalty,

2297
01:21:46,115 --> 01:21:48,114
but I am a lot older than the members.

2298
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:52,569
You should get the penalty in my stead.

2299
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:54,615
We can't do that.

2300
01:21:54,695 --> 01:21:56,255
We are a team and rules are rules.

2301
01:21:56,256 --> 01:21:58,595
Let's go eat dried persimmons.

2302
01:21:58,596 --> 01:22:00,295
- Let's enjoy the asset. - Let's eat dried persimmons.

2303
01:22:00,296 --> 01:22:01,665
- Take care. - Bye, Byung Ok.

2304
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,251
- Enjoy the penalty. - Good luck.

2305
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:05,123
- Bye, Byung Ok. - Enjoy the penalty.

2306
01:22:05,235 --> 01:22:06,822
Ji Hyo hasn't had a penalty in a long time.

2307
01:22:07,735 --> 01:22:09,048
We failed.

2308
01:22:09,376 --> 01:22:11,294
The sunset is beautiful.

2309
01:22:12,145 --> 01:22:13,444
It's the whipped cream bomb.

2310
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:14,527
(The penalty is the whipped cream bomb.)

2311
01:22:14,916 --> 01:22:17,006
Byung Ok isn't exempt, is he?

2312
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,915
(There are 4 people and 2 bombs. No one is exempt.)

2313
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:20,154
Really?

2314
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:21,385
In that case...

2315
01:22:21,386 --> 01:22:22,496
- Decide... - How will we decide?

2316
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:23,695
among yourselves.

2317
01:22:25,025 --> 01:22:26,338
Let's decide fairly.

2318
01:22:26,556 --> 01:22:27,666
Okay.

2319
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,681
(What is he doing?)

2320
01:22:31,725 --> 01:22:34,220
Hold on. What are you doing?

2321
01:22:34,466 --> 01:22:35,707
What are you doing?

2322
01:22:35,865 --> 01:22:37,380
- The sunset is beautiful. - What?

2323
01:22:37,565 --> 01:22:38,677
I was looking at the sunset.

2324
01:22:39,065 --> 01:22:40,205
He made us laugh with his back.

2325
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:41,934
- Can't I look at the sunset? - I am jealous of him.

2326
01:22:41,935 --> 01:22:43,845
You can look, but...

2327
01:22:43,846 --> 01:22:44,904
He made us laugh with his back.

2328
01:22:44,905 --> 01:22:45,904
(It's not that I don't want to receive the penalty.)

2329
01:22:45,905 --> 01:22:46,986
My goodness.

2330
01:22:47,016 --> 01:22:48,156
He was moved.

2331
01:22:48,416 --> 01:22:49,931
Let's play a game.

2332
01:22:51,315 --> 01:22:52,385
- Really? - Yes.

2333
01:22:52,386 --> 01:22:53,396
Let's decide fairly.

2334
01:22:54,086 --> 01:22:55,530
Let's play Game of Wits. One!

2335
01:22:57,426 --> 01:22:58,724
Let's play Game of Wits. One!

2336
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:00,715
- Two! - The two of you are it!

2337
01:23:01,195 --> 01:23:02,255
One!

2338
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:04,346
(Gosh, he got us.)

2339
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:06,534
The two of you went down at the same time.

2340
01:23:06,535 --> 01:23:07,809
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo get chosen.)

2341
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:09,965
(They get the penalty instead of the asset.)

2342
01:23:09,966 --> 01:23:11,855
It's a good day to receive the penalty.

2343
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:14,619
In 1, 2, 3.

2344
01:23:21,516 --> 01:23:22,644
What happened to Kwang Soo?

2345
01:23:22,645 --> 01:23:24,345
(Kwang Soo?)

2346
01:23:24,346 --> 01:23:25,385
What happened to Kwang Soo?

2347
01:23:25,386 --> 01:23:26,829
(I am sorry, Kwang Soo.)

2348
01:23:27,285 --> 01:23:28,427
You look cool.

2349
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:30,085
Stay that way for a second.

2350
01:23:30,086 --> 01:23:31,125
(Upon a closer look...)

2351
01:23:31,126 --> 01:23:32,324
You look like Groot.

2352
01:23:32,325 --> 01:23:34,073
(I am Lee Kwang Soo. I am Groot.)

2353
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:36,595
See you next week.

2354
01:23:36,596 --> 01:23:39,151
(I am Lee Kwang Soo.)

2355
01:23:39,966 --> 01:23:41,076
Look at the sunset.

2356
01:23:41,996 --> 01:23:47,228
(The legend within the family gets wrapped up.)

2357
01:23:47,336 --> 01:23:50,275
(How well do you know Running Man?)

2358
01:23:50,575 --> 01:23:53,404
(It's a sudden question.)

2359
01:23:54,115 --> 01:23:58,257
(Which member knows the Running Man members the best?)

2360
01:23:58,315 --> 01:24:00,002
(It's either Jong Kook or Seok Jin.)

2361
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:01,984
(- It's Jeon So Min. - It's Haha.)

2362
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:03,500
(You don't know anything about me.)

2363
01:24:03,725 --> 01:24:05,745
(The answers they blurt out change everything.)

2364
01:24:05,756 --> 01:24:09,028
(The members get dragged to a mysterious place.)

2365
01:24:09,796 --> 01:24:13,471
(Unknown missions await them.)

2366
01:24:14,235 --> 01:24:16,862
(No one can leave.)

2367
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:19,085
(However,)

2368
01:24:19,565 --> 01:24:22,135
(a miracle...)

2369
01:24:22,136 --> 01:24:23,545
(that is hard to believe...)

2370
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:25,805
(occurs.)

2371
01:24:25,806 --> 01:24:27,290
(This has never happened before.)

2372
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:28,757
(Do we go home?)

2373
01:24:29,546 --> 01:24:30,930
(No!)

2374
01:24:31,145 --> 01:24:33,684
(Irene, Joy,)

2375
01:24:33,685 --> 01:24:35,055
(Kang Han Na,)

2376
01:24:35,056 --> 01:24:36,328
(and Seol In Ah)

2377
01:24:36,685 --> 01:24:38,908
(The familiar partners are back.)

2378
01:24:39,695 --> 01:24:41,555
(The cheerful partners...)

2379
01:24:41,556 --> 01:24:44,555
(adjust to the variety show with a bang.)

2380
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:46,765
(Also)

2381
01:24:46,766 --> 01:24:49,088
(I know Jae Seok's weakness.)

2382
01:24:49,166 --> 01:24:52,599
(Is there a story about the national MC we don't know?)

2383
01:24:52,735 --> 01:24:55,563
(What's the secret of the national MC?)

2384
01:24:56,235 --> 01:24:58,164
(Intimate Strangers)
