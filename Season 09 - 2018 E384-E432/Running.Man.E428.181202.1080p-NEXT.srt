1
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,780
Hello.

2
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:10,990
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,120
- Hello. - Gloves? It's not that even cold.

4
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:15,960
- Seok Jin, this is fashion. - What fashion?

5
00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,360
- Are you that cold, Jae Seok? - I can't believe you.

6
00:00:17,364 --> 00:00:19,090
This is fashion.

7
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,760
Hey, it's really sunny out today.

8
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:23,030
Who is that over there? Is he a beggar?

9
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:25,570
- My goodness, that's too much. - What's up with your pants?

10
00:00:25,572 --> 00:00:28,500
- Haha wasn't that bad in the past. - Exactly.

11
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:30,270
- There was an article once. - What did it say?

12
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:32,240
(After that article, his outfits have been too much.)

13
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,240
- It was 1 year or 2 years ago. - It was with G-Dragon.

14
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:36,650
He and G-Dragon were named for the fashion article.

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,210
I'm the only one who can match his style.

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,850
- He said he was going to sue you. - Listen.

17
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,650
(Stop talking nonsense, Haha.)

18
00:00:43,657 --> 00:00:47,290
No, that's not true. This is what G-Dragon told me one day.

19
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:49,475
"Haha, where did you buy this?"

20
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,705
Because it was revolting?

21
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,875
- It was. "Where did you get that?" - Revolting?

22
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:58,030
- What is that? What is it? - What is it?

23
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,130
Are you learning how to be a DJ?

24
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,100
- You posted that on your account. - What is that?

25
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:04,170
I went to visit one of my friends who is a DJ.

26
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,240
- I tried it, and it was so fun. - And?

27
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm learning it as a hobby.

28
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,750
At first, I thought that he finally bought his hearing aid.

29
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,980
(At first, I thought that he finally bought his hearing aid.)

30
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,220
- He had something on his ears. - Hearing aids aren't that big.

31
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:18,690
(Seok Jin's hearing aid is big to match his big nose.)

32
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:20,490
- A hearing aid. - I thought...

33
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:22,690
Hey, no hearing aid can be that big.

34
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:24,990
- He was getting his hearing tested. - He wouldn't hear things well.

35
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:27,500
All right. Since it's the kimchi-making season,

36
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,960
- you must find its best partner. - Kimchi?

37
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,470
It's the Kimchi Special. Today, you'll do a race called...

38
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:35,470
Who Is Kimchi's Partner?

39
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:37,470
What do you mean by kimchi's partner?

40
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:39,310
- It's pork belly. - Are we getting kimchi?

41
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,310
You're right. Like kimchi and tofu.

42
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:42,680
- Right. It could be tofu. - Right.

43
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,880
- You'll form teams first. - There is.

44
00:01:44,884 --> 00:01:46,625
- What's going on now? - What is that?

45
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:49,250
- Gosh, there's rice. - Rice.

46
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:51,705
- Sweet potatoes go well with that. - There are sweet potatoes.

47
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,120
- No, it's ramyeon! - I see.

48
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:55,890
Kimchi and ramyeon make the perfect pair.

49
00:01:55,895 --> 00:01:57,660
Jae Seok will choose ramyeon.

50
00:01:57,664 --> 00:02:00,875
- Sweet potatoes are steaming! - Gosh, those are hot!

51
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,400
- Goodness, the sweet potatoes. - Sweet potatoes look appetizing.

52
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:05,370
- They got tasty ones too. - This looks really good.

53
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,100
- Kimchi is great with suyuk too. - Goodness.

54
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:08,100
- It looks so delicious. - Ramyeon...

55
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,310
- Rice is great with kimchi. - With freshly made kimchi.

56
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:16,010
You'll pick a dish that you believe it to be the best partner.

57
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,650
Each dish can have up to two members.

58
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,780
(Taking the seat)

59
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:22,950
Seok Jin.

60
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,420
(Will Seok Jin and So Min choose the sweet potatoes?)

61
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,890
- Seok Jin. - You should move then.

62
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,590
- Choose something else. - I will...

63
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:31,490
I'll go with ramyeon. Ramyeon and kimchi are the best.

64
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,560
- It's hot. - You need kimchi for ramyeon.

65
00:02:33,566 --> 00:02:34,930
End of discussion.

66
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,300
- This is hard to decide. - It's hot.

67
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,370
I'll go with suyuk.

68
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,500
(He chooses the suyuk which is high in protein.)

69
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,670
- I'll choose suyuk. - Look at this. It's steaming.

70
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:41,300
- Kimchi and suyuk are the best. - Take a seat.

71
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:42,370
- Hold on. - What?

72
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:45,840
- It has to be rice, you know. - Haha, come here.

73
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,180
Rice and freshly made kimchi...

74
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,980
- are the best pairing. - Everything goes well with kimchi.

75
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:52,280
But I kind of want to get some ramyeon too. This is crazy.

76
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:53,580
- I'll go with ramyeon. - I choose ramyeon.

77
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:55,080
- Hold on. - Why?

78
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:57,150
No one wants to join Seok Jin.

79
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,490
- I choose ramyeon. - I choose ramyeon.

80
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,735
- I'll go with sweet potatoes then. - Sweet potatoes?

81
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,090
Sweet potatoes.

82
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,360
Why are you sitting here?

83
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:05,560
I have to choose this. I ought to choose sweet potatoes.

84
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:06,560
I choose sweet potatoes.

85
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:07,930
(Ramyeon: Jae Seok, Se Chan, Sweet Potato: Seok Jin, Kwang Soo)

86
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,900
(Suyuk: Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, Rice: Haha, So Min)

87
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:11,570
Stand with your teams.

88
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:15,670
We have invited your soulmates who will join you on the journey...

89
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:18,410
of searching the best partner for kimchi.

90
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,740
- "Soulmates". - "Soulmates".

91
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,155
"Soulmates"? Who are they?

92
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:24,050
(Wait, this song is...)

93
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,080
TWICE!

94
00:03:25,084 --> 00:03:26,480
(No way. They are really here?)

95
00:03:26,486 --> 00:03:27,580
Really?

96
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,890
- All of them? It's the whole group! - All of them are here.

97
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,690
- The whole group is here! - Unbelievable!

98
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,335
(TWICE in its entirety)

99
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:37,930
(They're a girl group that specializes in breaking records.)

100
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,530
(The world-class girl group, the million-dollar baby, TWICE)

101
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:44,870
(The most sought-after idol group has joined Running Man.)

102
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,400
(He can't stop smiling.)

103
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,500
TWICE! TWICE!

104
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,970
(They are cute and adorable soulmates of Running Man.)

105
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,370
(Hey, guys. We're here!)

106
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:55,240
We love you, TWICE!

107
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:58,480
(We didn't know what you'd like, but we still prepared this.)

108
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,750
(Choose 1 of the 2)

109
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:03,735
(Say yes no matter what!)

110
00:04:05,558 --> 00:04:07,420
(When TWICE does their part,)

111
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:10,190
(the members respond.)

112
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:13,030
(TWICE is our partner!)

113
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:15,860
(They're overly excited to see TWICE.)

114
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:17,485
TWICE!

115
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,630
- Hello. - You're so pretty.

116
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,300
- I'm such a fan. - Hello.

117
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,770
Hey, hello. Goodness.

118
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,640
Can you introduce yourselves to the viewers first?

119
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:26,210
- Okay. - 1, 2, 3.

120
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:27,780
- 1 in a million. Hello. - 1 in a million. Hello.

121
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,180
- We're TWICE. - TWICE!

122
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,280
TWICE, TWICE, TWICE, TWICE!

123
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:36,890
- Our brother group, family group, - That's right.

124
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,490
- and sister group. - Sister group.

125
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,490
- They're like our family. - You can use any nicknames.

126
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:44,205
By the way, it's quite chilly today.

127
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:45,830
- It's so cold. - Today...

128
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,300
Jeongyeon, it's really cold today.

129
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,160
- I'm freezing. - Right, right.

130
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,170
All right. First of all, we have TWICE with us.

131
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:54,840
TWICE introduced themselves just now.

132
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,970
(Why is he giving his coat to her?)

133
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:58,685
- What? - You look cold.

134
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,095
(Throwing away)

135
00:05:01,214 --> 00:05:03,380
Gosh, he's trying to get a nice story out of this.

136
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:05,680
(There he goes again, trying to get a close-up.)

137
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,020
- He's coming back again. - What are you doing?

138
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,220
Hey, you should wear this, at least.

139
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,580
(Talking to Nayeon)

140
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:13,005
What are you doing? They seem cold. They look cold.

141
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,020
(His coat can't come near TWICE.)

142
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,735
"You should wear this, at least."

143
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:18,490
- What are you doing? - They're freezing.

144
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:21,000
TWICE has to be on TV in their own outfits!

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,830
- They seemed especially cold. - What are you talking about?

146
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,645
- You're unbelievable. - They're healthier than you.

147
00:05:26,673 --> 00:05:28,470
One wrong move can destroy you.

148
00:05:28,474 --> 00:05:29,670
Fine.

149
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,210
- Jeongyeon is cold. - Listen up.

150
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,510
TWICE visited us on the orientation trip in the beginning of the year.

151
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:38,180
- That's right. It was so short. - Right.

152
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,850
You did the acrostic poems and danced for us.

153
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:43,690
- It was brief, but sensational. - Yes, indeed.

154
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,935
- That's when she did her cute act. - Exactly.

155
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:49,860
(Kim)

156
00:05:49,862 --> 00:05:52,460
(I want to eat kimchi fried rice.)

157
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:55,500
(I want to eat it with Jong Kook.)

158
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,400
(Goo goo gaa gaa)

159
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:00,230
(That was the final blow.)

160
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:05,470
(She dominated the field with her cute act.)

161
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,780
- It was crazy. - It created quite a sensation.

162
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,010
That's right. Did you prepare another acrostic poem today?

163
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,180
- Yes, Nayeon prepared one. - Yes.

164
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,650
- Does Nayeon have one? - Yes, she has one.

165
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,980
- Yes, she has one. - Momo has one too.

166
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:18,390
- Momo. - Momo, do you want to go first?

167
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:20,960
- Okay. - What's the keyword?

168
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,660
- I'll do one with Jee Seok Jin. - Gosh, with Jee Seok Jin?

169
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:24,760
(She'll do an acrostic poem with Jee Seok Jin?)

170
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,860
- Seok Jin! There's your close-up. - Gosh.

171
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:27,860
(This is what you've been after.)

172
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,260
Hurry. Hurry up and go. This is the close-up you love.

173
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,000
- Get a shot with her. - Hey. They can get it from here.

174
00:06:33,006 --> 00:06:34,200
My goodness.

175
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,300
This is Seok Jin's close-up.

176
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:36,740
All right. Do the acrostic poem.

177
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:39,040
I didn't think she'd choose Seok Jin.

178
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:42,180
The fact that she chose Seok Jin itself is unusual.

179
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:43,680
We'll start with Jee.

180
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:46,225
- "Jee". - She's so nice.

181
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,850
Jee Seok Jin.

182
00:06:47,854 --> 00:06:49,250
- "Jee Seok Jin". - "Jee Seok Jin".

183
00:06:49,255 --> 00:06:51,590
- "Seok". - Seok Jin's nose is...

184
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,860
"Seok Jin's nose is..." Go ahead.

185
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,535
Truly...

186
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,945
a big nose.

187
00:07:00,166 --> 00:07:04,100
(In person, his nose is huge.)

188
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:06,130
- That was cute. - "Truly a big nose".

189
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,400
"Truly a big nose".

190
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,410
(She made his big nose cute.)

191
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,610
That was great.

192
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,070
The last part was great.

193
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,610
It sounded plain, but she twisted the last part.

194
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:17,350
"Seok Jin's nose is..."

195
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,310
- "Truly a big nose". - "Truly a big nose".

196
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:21,520
(According to Momo, Seok Jin has a big nose.)

197
00:07:21,521 --> 00:07:22,980
That's great.

198
00:07:22,989 --> 00:07:24,120
Well done.

199
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:25,950
All right. Let's hear Nayeon's.

200
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,120
With whose name will you do yours?

201
00:07:27,126 --> 00:07:29,660
- I'll do it with Ji Hyo's name. - Ji Hyo.

202
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:30,860
- Gosh. - It's Ji Hyo.

203
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,905
Do one with her name. Go ahead.

204
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:35,660
My fingers hurt.

205
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,370
Her fingers hurt?

206
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,840
(She launches her cute act when no one is expecting it.)

207
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,200
(Slurring)

208
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,470
- She started right away. - Right off the bat.

209
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,040
- I wasn't even prepared for that. - Your fingers hurt.

210
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,710
- I wasn't ready at all. - My goodness.

211
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,480
- She started already. - I didn't see that one coming.

212
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:51,950
- I can't get excited yet. - We'll go to the next one.

213
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,950
Kwang Soo, come here right now.

214
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:55,320
- Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo. - Go.

215
00:07:55,321 --> 00:07:56,680
- She asked for you. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

216
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,765
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Gosh.

217
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:05,290
(I came here right away upon Nayeon's calling.)

218
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:06,860
(Both of them are feeling shy.)

219
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,900
Go ahead.

220
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,760
(She's the expert in acrostic poem. How will she finish?)

221
00:08:09,769 --> 00:08:11,700
(My fingers hurt. Kwang Soo, come here right now.)

222
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:12,970
Please blow on them.

223
00:08:12,972 --> 00:08:15,870
(Please blow on them.)

224
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,985
(Slurring)

225
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,780
She's so cute.

226
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:23,580
(Punching)

227
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,810
(How dare you, you punk!)

228
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:27,350
(The fans take the initiatives to cut this part out.)

229
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:28,350
Stop it!

230
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,620
- Why would you do that? Why? - Stop it!

231
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,665
- How dare you? - Don't do it.

232
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:34,990
- Stop it. - Your breath stinks!

233
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:39,445
(I'll protect your fingers no matter what.)

234
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:41,960
- She's great. - That was so original.

235
00:08:41,968 --> 00:08:43,460
- The first line was original. - Right.

236
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,200
- I didn't see that one coming. - My goodness.

237
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:47,700
- It was beyond our imagination. - Goodness, her fingers.

238
00:08:47,707 --> 00:08:49,070
This one is about Dahyun.

239
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:52,440
These days, you have a new nickname, Mr. Tofu.

240
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,610
(Another interesting fact is Dahyun's nickname.)

241
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:56,710
- My nickname is Tofu. - Okay.

242
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,380
They combined it with a title for men.

243
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,380
- That's why you're Mr. Tofu. - They call me Mr. Tofu.

244
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:01,780
That's why. I see.

245
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,620
I see how you got your nickname.

246
00:09:03,623 --> 00:09:05,650
You mispronounced it. You said, "plate" instead.

247
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:08,120
(You mispronounced it. You said, "plate" instead.)

248
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,460
- It's Mr. Tofu. - Mr. Tofu.

249
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:10,860
- Be careful with the pronunciation. - Come on.

250
00:09:10,863 --> 00:09:13,190
- It's not "plate". - Why is she a plate?

251
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,800
It's Mr. Tofu.

252
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,700
All right. Mr. Tofu.

253
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:18,270
Just like last time,

254
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:20,170
- she'll show us impressive dance. - Right.

255
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:21,400
Dance for us since you're here.

256
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,470
Without further ado,

257
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,270
we'll ask her to dance for us.

258
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,010
- Dahyun, please show us your dance! - Okay.

259
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,510
But what kind of music will you play?

260
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,525
Music? Which song is it?

261
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,595
Can you dance to this?

262
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:37,905
Can you dance to this?

263
00:09:38,157 --> 00:09:39,720
There she is again. Look at her face.

264
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:41,435
(Of course, I can.)

265
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,820
There she is again.

266
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:43,890
- She changed right away. - Gosh.

267
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:45,645
(What... What is this?)

268
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,700
(Dancing)

269
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,330
- Mr. Tofu. Mr. Tofu. - You have to do it now.

270
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:52,345
(Here comes Mr. Tofu. Step aside.)

271
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:54,300
(Staggering)

272
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,270
- Gosh, he is Mr. Tofu indeed. - Look at her swag.

273
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:58,410
(It's the swag of a middle-aged man.)

274
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,440
Gosh, look at her dance.

275
00:09:59,445 --> 00:10:00,610
Seriously, her dance.

276
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,580
(Why must we suffer embarrassment for her dance?)

277
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:04,380
- Gosh, she's adorable. - She doesn't like the sun.

278
00:10:04,383 --> 00:10:06,550
- Do you not like the sun? - Why are you blocking it?

279
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:08,450
(Last night, she had a nice after-work dinner.)

280
00:10:08,454 --> 00:10:10,420
- She's cold now. She's freezing. - She's cold.

281
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,190
(I hate the rising sun in the midst of the morning air.)

282
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,460
- She's shivering. - What is that?

283
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,990
(Mr. Tofu's swag embraces the joys and sorrows of an office worker.)

284
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:22,975
(Mr. Tofu would like to cheer for all of middle-aged men out there.)

285
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:25,300
(Her dance of a middle-aged man is also a big success.)

286
00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:27,815
She walked like a middle-aged man.

287
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,540
She came out like one from the start.

288
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,570
- Seriously. - Right now...

289
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:32,685
I want to give her the long johns as a present.

290
00:10:33,446 --> 00:10:34,540
Thank you.

291
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,380
All right. That was Mr. Tofu.

292
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,050
Continuing from Dahyun's dance,

293
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,650
Momo will dance too.

294
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:40,980
- She was really good that day. - What's this?

295
00:10:40,987 --> 00:10:42,650
- Wasn't she great that day? - She was phenomenal.

296
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,020
- They went to the final that day. - Her sexy dance moves were great.

297
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,650
All right. Momo. Are you ready?

298
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,435
- I'll play the music. - Okay

299
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,130
- What is this song? - She was in the final too.

300
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,390
She's so cool.

301
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:55,775
(When the song plays, she shyly walks out.)

302
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:01,655
(There's a sudden change.)

303
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,640
(As a warm-up, she splits the beats.)

304
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:08,695
(Shall I get started now?)

305
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,225
- How does she do this? - Seriously.

306
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,810
(Groovy and sexy)

307
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:15,250
- Gosh. - She's flexible.

308
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,635
How could she be so flexible?

309
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:22,690
(Momo is the best dancer. Dance like Momo to be popular.)

310
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:25,190
(Gosh! Way to go, Momo!)

311
00:11:25,197 --> 00:11:27,060
(Her girl-crushing bounce...)

312
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,630
(makes her performance explode.)

313
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:31,730
She's so cool.

314
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:33,230
(She's so cool whenever she dances.)

315
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:34,640
You were crazy.

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
(She shows off her charms today just like last time.)

317
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,140
- She's such a great dancer. - That was amazing.

318
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:39,340
- She's so good. - She's amazing.

319
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:40,510
(What do you lack, TWICE?)

320
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,040
- You were great. - That was so cool.

321
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:43,410
- You were indeed great. - You were so cool.

322
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,010
- Jeongyeon, it's warm now, right? - Seriously. She's so cool.

323
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:46,765
- It's really warm. - It's so warm.

324
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,450
(To continue with this heated momentum...)

325
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,120
Right now, the members...

326
00:11:50,122 --> 00:11:53,190
have chosen a partner for kimchi.

327
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,860
TWICE must choose from...

328
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,390
ramyeon, sweet potatoes, suyuk, and rice,

329
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:01,560
the best food pairing for kimchi.

330
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,030
Each team can hold up to four people.

331
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:06,830
Only one team will have five people in it.

332
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,570
A team with five people will have an advantage for a mission.

333
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:11,270
Please choose wisely.

334
00:12:11,277 --> 00:12:13,210
I have ramyeon. Come on!

335
00:12:13,212 --> 00:12:15,140
- Come to ramyeon. - Come to suyuk!

336
00:12:15,147 --> 00:12:18,210
- Ramyeon goes well with kimchi. - It's ramyeon and kimchi.

337
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,410
Girls, it's suyuk.

338
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:21,820
- Kimchi goes with suyuk. - Of course!

339
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,050
- It's meat. - Rice.

340
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:26,020
- Hey, you. - You can't eat this without kimchi.

341
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:29,035
Rice and kimchi are the best.

342
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:30,830
Think about the freshly made kimchi.

343
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,260
- All right. 1, 2, 3. - This is the best pairing.

344
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,900
- Come here. It's rice. - Come here.

345
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,860
- There you go! - Gosh!

346
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,030
This is it!

347
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,270
- I can't believe my luck. - What's going on?

348
00:12:39,271 --> 00:12:41,070
- I can't believe this. - Gosh.

349
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:43,340
- Come here. Rice? - Hey, it's suyuk!

350
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:45,040
- It's suyuk! - It's meat!

351
00:12:45,044 --> 00:12:46,870
- Suyuk, suyuk! - We chose suyuk!

352
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,180
- Right? Suyuk is the best! - That's right.

353
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,540
- You need meat! - Suyuk is the best indeed.

354
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:50,980
- Come on. - You need ramyeon for kimchi.

355
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:53,280
- Ramyeon. - Ramyeon.

356
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:55,150
(Passing by)

357
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,180
- Jae Seok. - No one chose ramyeon?

358
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:58,350
Choose sweet potatoes!

359
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,390
(No one chooses sweet potatoes too.)

360
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:01,075
Sweet potatoes!

361
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,835
What's going on?

362
00:13:03,763 --> 00:13:05,260
Ramyeon?

363
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,730
- Jae Seok. - No one chose ramyeon?

364
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,730
(These two teams are low on members.)

365
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,160
- Okay! - Yes!

366
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,470
(Nayeon and Momo save Team Ramyeon.)

367
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,530
- What is this? - Look at them.

368
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:14,100
- No one picked sweet potatoes! - Hey, come here!

369
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:15,670
- No one went to sweet potatoes. - How could this be possible?

370
00:13:15,674 --> 00:13:17,170
- No one? - How could this happen?

371
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:19,170
No one chose sweet potatoes?

372
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:21,380
- Why don't you eat sweet potatoes? - Not even one chose our food.

373
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,740
- Right now, - How is this possible?

374
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:25,250
there are six people in Team Rice.

375
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,680
- No, what am I going to do? - Send two of them...

376
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:28,920
to Team Sweet Potato.

377
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:31,690
- What am I going to do? - No, this is so sad.

378
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,120
(It must be done.)

379
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,975
Don't say it like it's a bad thing.

380
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,360
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

381
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,360
They are so loyal to each other.

382
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,430
- All right. The losers? - The losers will go there.

383
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,430
- The losers will go. - Ready or not,

384
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,345
- rock-paper-scissors - rock-paper-scissors

385
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,600
(Jeongyeon and Tzuyu won. Chaeyoung and Mina lost.)

386
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:50,540
(Jeongyeon and Tzuyu will stay in Team Rice.)

387
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,070
- Okay! - My goodness.

388
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,470
(We're off to Team Sweet Potato.)

389
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,440
- Hey. - Hey, this is a great team.

390
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:58,025
- That's a great team. - I'm fine. I'm okay.

391
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,050
(Meanwhile, Mr. Tofu from Team Suyuk...)

392
00:14:01,053 --> 00:14:02,420
(Looking around)

393
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:03,950
- Mr. Tofu? - TWICE can choose.

394
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,750
- They can change their teams? - Mr. Tofu.

395
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:07,460
- I'd like to change my team. - Think carefully.

396
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,890
- Join our team. - Choose Team Rice.

397
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:10,160
We have a spot for one more member.

398
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:11,830
- Join us, Dahyun. - Choose Team Rice.

399
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,630
Sweet potatoes are nicely cooked.

400
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,430
We can have one more.

401
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:20,970
(Which team will Dahyun choose and become its 5th member?)

402
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,400
- I'll go with Team Sweet Potato. - Don't even look at them.

403
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,040
- Team Sweet Potato! - Yes!

404
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,570
(Dahyun chooses the sweet potatoes like a true middle-aged man.)

405
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,340
Our team has won at the end.

406
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,410
We have five members.

407
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,510
- All the teams have been formed. - Okay.

408
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:32,265
(Only Team Sweet Potato has 5 members.)

409
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:36,950
(They finished teaming up.)

410
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,720
It's the Kimchi Special with TWICE.

411
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,020
The race is called Who Is Kimchi's Partner?

412
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,990
We asked teenagers to people in their 50s...

413
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:48,400
which food complements kimchi the most through a survey.

414
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,230
The team who guesses the food in first place wins the race.

415
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,970
You can buy hints about...

416
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:57,300
the food in first place with cabbage leaves you earn from missions.

417
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,840
The team that guesses the food in first place won't face a penalty.

418
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:01,780
The rest of three teams who have lost the race will...

419
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,250
- season 100 heads of Napa cabbages. - 100 heads?

420
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,380
What? What's that?

421
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,850
We have to season 100 heads of Napa cabbages.

422
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:10,520
We'll have to do 100?

423
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:12,405
Anyway, this will be fun.

424
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:13,650
- You think this will be fun? - Yes.

425
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,460
They're so positive.

426
00:15:15,461 --> 00:15:19,405
(Which team will avoid getting this frightening kimchi penalty?)

427
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:22,930
(The first mission after changing outfits)

428
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:25,285
- Why are there stairs? - What's that?

429
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,470
Stand with your teams.

430
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:30,870
- What happened? - My hand warmer exploded again.

431
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,685
- It exploded again? - Yes.

432
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,740
It exploded again in the car earlier.

433
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:36,655
Your hand warmer exploded?

434
00:15:36,782 --> 00:15:38,310
Hey, get me some wet wipes.

435
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,025
Dahyun's hand warmer...

436
00:15:40,753 --> 00:15:42,120
Seok Jin and his good stories.

437
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,750
He got another close-up with his forced story.

438
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:45,220
- He's aiming for one more close-up. - He's forcing it.

439
00:15:45,224 --> 00:15:46,890
- You're forcing it again. - Seok Jin, why...

440
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:47,990
(I'm getting my shot, right?)

441
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:50,635
- Seok Jin with his good stories. - Another close-up.

442
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:51,660
Thank you.

443
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:53,330
(Thank you, anyway.)

444
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:55,900
Here's the first mission for you to get your hints.

445
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:59,100
It's called Invest Napa Cabbages, Line up.

446
00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:00,270
(Invest Napa Cabbages, Line up)

447
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:04,885
Each team will receive 50 cabbage leaves.

448
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,580
You'll bet your cabbage leaves every round.

449
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,310
The winning team will win additional leaves as many as their bets.

450
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:12,850
(The winning team wins additional leaves as many as their bets.)

451
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:15,620
- Gosh, should we be adventurous? - Should we give that a try?

452
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,120
- Should we go all in? - Shall we?

453
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:18,620
When the final mission is over,

454
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:21,390
you can go to the Hint Shop and buy the hints you want...

455
00:16:21,393 --> 00:16:23,220
with cabbage leaves you earned.

456
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:25,090
All right. For the missions of each round,

457
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:29,160
you will hear what it is first and choose the order to try the mission.

458
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,870
If everyone in your team passes in order, it's a success.

459
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,770
(Pass the mission in the assigned order.)

460
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,940
- We have five. It's harder for us. - Our team is at a disadvantage.

461
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,670
Since other teams have four members,

462
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:39,970
you have to choose four players...

463
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:42,855
- for each game. - Only four.

464
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:46,050
- You guys play. - Seok Jin should stay out.

465
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,780
Kwang Soo will stay out.

466
00:16:47,786 --> 00:16:49,220
(Disapproving)

467
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,990
- Seok Jin. - Kwang Soo will stay out.

468
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,765
Kwang Soo will stay out. Let's do this.

469
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:56,160
Either Kwang Soo or Seok Jin should stay out.

470
00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:57,160
(What will happen to Team Sweet Potato?)

471
00:16:57,162 --> 00:16:59,930
The first round is Low Bar Rollover.

472
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:02,160
(First Round: Low Bar Rollover)

473
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,270
The bar will get lower and lower. Roll over it once...

474
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:06,830
one by one.

475
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,970
Roll over the bar?

476
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:09,000
We have to roll over the bar?

477
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:10,040
(Success)

478
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:13,240
Please decide the order and make a bet.

479
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,780
Which of you is the most athletic?

480
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:17,180
That doesn't really matter.

481
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:18,550
As long as the head doesn't touch the ground...

482
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,420
- This... - It's not going to be easy.

483
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,450
Nayeon should do the forward roll.

484
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,050
You and I should do the backward roll.

485
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:26,190
Should we do that?

486
00:17:26,191 --> 00:17:27,420
Ji Hyo...

487
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,690
(Team Suyuk's strategy)

488
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,890
Ji Hyo has a long upper body, so she should go first.

489
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:32,090
(Harsh)

490
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:34,500
(I can't believe him.)

491
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,630
I think you can do it.

492
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:37,900
- You should go first. - What if I fail?

493
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:38,930
No.

494
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:42,040
- You go 3rd. - I'll go 3rd. You go 2nd.

495
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,200
- How many should we bet? - 12?

496
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,810
- 12? - 15.

497
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,540
- 15. - 15.

498
00:17:46,545 --> 00:17:47,540
We can do it.

499
00:17:47,546 --> 00:17:48,980
We can roll backwards.

500
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:50,610
Your head might touch...

501
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,880
15.

502
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:53,310
- What do you say? - Good.

503
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,220
Guys, let's bet just one.

504
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,620
Just one?

505
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,050
I think we'll fail.

506
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,350
- I think so too. - It's better than losing a lot.

507
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,720
- We'll bet big later. - Exactly.

508
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,030
(Line-ups and Bets)

509
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,760
Line up. Decide which team will go first.

510
00:18:07,766 --> 00:18:09,400
(Line-ups and Bets)

511
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:11,070
- Go, So Min. - You can do this!

512
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,200
So Min, give that to me.

513
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:13,845
Okay.

514
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,640
I've never done this before.

515
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:18,070
If you fail, your team is out.

516
00:18:18,077 --> 00:18:19,810
- How do I do it? - You have only one chance.

517
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,240
- Do I roll on my stomach? - You have only one chance.

518
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:24,180
- Yes. - Show us who you are.

519
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,550
Let's go!

520
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,180
(How will So Min's first try go?)

521
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,350
Try to remember how you did it when you were little.

522
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,195
Good.

523
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,520
If you fail, you're out.

524
00:18:32,524 --> 00:18:34,420
(In the 1st round, the bar is 100cm high, so it's pretty easy.)

525
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,460
(She's rolling.)

526
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:37,490
Keep going.

527
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:38,990
There you go.

528
00:18:38,997 --> 00:18:40,060
- Keep going. - Hey.

529
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,075
Good.

530
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:43,730
Hold on.

531
00:18:43,736 --> 00:18:45,230
Is this okay?

532
00:18:45,237 --> 00:18:46,770
Is this a success?

533
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,240
- Does it count? - Is it okay?

534
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,255
She just fell.

535
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:53,370
- Does this count? - You have to land on your feet.

536
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,840
Stop pretending it doesn't hurt.

537
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,680
Shouldn't we land on our feet?

538
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,310
Stop pretending.

539
00:18:58,317 --> 00:18:59,750
We should land on our feet.

540
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:01,850
She fell with a thud.

541
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,480
I was too heavy.

542
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:05,950
(Although her bottom hurts, So Min succeeds.)

543
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,290
Go, Team Ramyeon!

544
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,190
(Next up is Nayeon from Team Ramyeon.)

545
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:11,430
I don't think I can do it.

546
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,445
(Floundering)

547
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,430
- Is it too hard? - You have to jump.

548
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:18,230
- Hold on. She's a mess. - Nayeon.

549
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:19,830
- She's a mess. - Nayeon.

550
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,100
Jump and roll over on your stomach.

551
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:23,870
You can't give her a lesson here.

552
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,240
What are you talking about?

553
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:26,910
- It's a lesson. - It's not a lesson.

554
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:28,810
- She has to start right away. - Jump up.

555
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:29,940
Just start.

556
00:19:29,948 --> 00:19:31,650
(Will Nayeon succeed?)

557
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,410
- Let's go. - I'm scared.

558
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,220
There you go. Jump up and roll over.

559
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,350
Bend over.

560
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:38,320
There you go. You can do this.

561
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:40,050
Roll over.

562
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:41,160
There you go.

563
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
(Nayeon's legs are wandering.)

564
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:46,530
(Will she land successfully?)

565
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,015
- Jump! - That's definitely a success.

566
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:51,830
- That's how you do it. - Good job, Nayeon.

567
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,330
(She lands perfectly.)

568
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:55,700
Good job, Nayeon.

569
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:57,600
- That's how you do it. - It was nothing.

570
00:19:57,609 --> 00:19:58,940
- Right? - Who is next?

571
00:19:58,944 --> 00:20:00,585
It's our turn.

572
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:02,210
It's our turn now.

573
00:20:02,214 --> 00:20:03,880
(Slow)

574
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,625
Seok Jin...

575
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,235
Are you the first player?

576
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,480
That's not okay.

577
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,650
The principal...

578
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:13,690
- came to our sports day. - Please give a speech.

579
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:14,720
(Is Seok Jin as good as So Min and Nayeon?)

580
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:17,560
I can't believe it. Seok Jin is the first player.

581
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:19,690
- Here we go. - If you fail, your team is out.

582
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,400
How could I fail?

583
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,330
(Offended)

584
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:25,970
(He sounds confident.)

585
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:29,240
(Even if my team has given up on me,)

586
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:32,240
(this would be easy.)

587
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,840
(He rolls over...)

588
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:37,455
(and falls.)

589
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:40,025
Isn't that a fail?

590
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:43,050
(Heavy)

591
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:46,820
(He falls on his bottom as it's the heaviest part.)

592
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:48,460
(Is he okay?)

593
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,660
Fail.

594
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:51,630
- Isn't that a fail? - It's a success.

595
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,730
He's rolled over.

596
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,960
- Success! - I've rolled over.

597
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,430
Okay!

598
00:20:56,435 --> 00:20:58,300
Sana!

599
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,070
We should hold the bar.

600
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,200
(She grabs the bar...)

601
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,270
(and jumps up right away.)

602
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:04,570
She's so light.

603
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:06,485
She's so flexible.

604
00:21:06,912 --> 00:21:09,055
Good job.

605
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,280
(She even lands perfectly.)

606
00:21:12,284 --> 00:21:14,650
- How did she do that? - She's so flexible.

607
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,180
She's flexible.

608
00:21:16,188 --> 00:21:17,520
She's so light.

609
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,865
(All 4 teams have passed the 1st round.)

610
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,360
The bar will be lowered now. Please lower it.

611
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,190
(In the 2nd round, the bar is lowered to 80cm high.)

612
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:25,930
It's too low.

613
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,630
Is that how much they lower it?

614
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:30,800
We'll follow the same order in the second round.

615
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:32,730
Go, Team Rice!

616
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:34,030
Team Rice!

617
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,140
- Tzuyu. - Let's go, Tzuyu!

618
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,140
(She feels a sense of duty.)

619
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:39,170
- You can do this! - You have to land on your feet.

620
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:40,670
If you don't, you're out.

621
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,240
Tzuyu, if you don't land on your feet, you're out.

622
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,240
You can do this.

623
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:45,925
Let's go, Tzuyu.

624
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,610
- There you go. - She's folded.

625
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:48,980
- She's folded her body. - There you go.

626
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:50,150
Bend over.

627
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,965
Roll over now.

628
00:21:52,257 --> 00:21:53,350
There you go.

629
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,860
If you don't land on your feet...

630
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,390
- Good! - Success.

631
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,145
It's a success.

632
00:21:59,364 --> 00:22:00,960
- There you go. - Your legs.

633
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:02,300
Good!

634
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:03,460
Let's do this, Dahyun!

635
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:04,930
Just land on your feet.

636
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,400
Your feet. There you go.

637
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,385
- Okay! - Good job.

638
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,340
It's Ji Hyo's turn!

639
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:11,810
There you go. Your legs.

640
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,270
- Good! - Yes!

641
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:14,940
- It'll be lowered to 60cm. - Good job.

642
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:16,310
(In the 3rd round, the bar is 60cm high.)

643
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:19,425
- Is that how low it's going to be? - It's impossible.

644
00:22:19,518 --> 00:22:21,820
- Team Rice will go first. - Team Rice!

645
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,795
Let's do this, Jeongyeon!

646
00:22:24,423 --> 00:22:27,790
Jeongyeon has been my partner all three times so far.

647
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,520
Even her sister, Seung Yeon, was my partner.

648
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,960
So what?

649
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:36,030
Stop talking about something irrelevant.

650
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,870
- We're a family. - It doesn't matter!

651
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,300
Just focus on raising your kids.

652
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:44,440
(Focus on your real family.)

653
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,040
(Gosh, they always get in my way.)

654
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:47,170
Here we go.

655
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:48,540
- Do it like this. - We're very close.

656
00:22:48,547 --> 00:22:50,210
Like this?

657
00:22:50,215 --> 00:22:52,050
- Is that harder? - It'd be hard to lift your legs.

658
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,810
It must be hard.

659
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:55,835
- Right. - It's not going to work.

660
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:57,150
Watch your head.

661
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,350
- Jeongyeon. - But...

662
00:22:58,357 --> 00:23:00,465
her head will definitely touch the ground.

663
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:02,935
Watch your head.

664
00:23:02,995 --> 00:23:04,020
Jeongyeon.

665
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:06,890
(With her head not touching, she has to land on her feet.)

666
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:08,260
Jeongyeon.

667
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:10,675
(Her head isn't touching the ground.)

668
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:17,270
(All she has to do now is land on her feet.)

669
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:19,240
Fail.

670
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,140
(She rolls over well...)

671
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,710
(but lands on her bottom.)

672
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:25,110
- That was close. - Is this even possible?

673
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:26,980
It's impossible.

674
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:28,250
(Good job, my family member.)

675
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:30,050
You have to stay close to the bar.

676
00:23:30,055 --> 00:23:31,050
Can you do it?

677
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:32,990
- It's Jae Seok's turn. - Who is next?

678
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,350
- Who is next? - It's your turn.

679
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,390
Is it my turn?

680
00:23:35,394 --> 00:23:36,490
(Next up is Jae Seok from Team Ramyeon.)

681
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,160
- Let me... - Please hold the bar.

682
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,460
Nayeon, please hold the bar.

683
00:23:39,464 --> 00:23:41,460
It's not going to be easy.

684
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:43,300
(Now that he's holding the bar, he realizes.)

685
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,070
- Is that even possible? - Are you doing a backward roll?

686
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm doing a backward roll.

687
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:47,770
- Are you doing a backward roll? - I'm doing a backward roll.

688
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,470
He has to lift his legs.

689
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:51,440
- Roll over. - Land on your feet.

690
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:53,140
- There you go. - Nice.

691
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:56,640
(Even with a forward roll, everyone has been struggling.)

692
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,180
He's doing a backward roll.

693
00:23:58,183 --> 00:23:59,610
(Jae Seok has decided to do a backward roll, which is harder.)

694
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:01,835
I don't think he can do it.

695
00:24:02,487 --> 00:24:03,480
Is that even possible?

696
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,890
- Are you doing a backward roll? - I'm doing a backward roll.

697
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:07,020
Without a run-up?

698
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:08,675
There you go.

699
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:12,030
(Will he succeed?)

700
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,330
Yes!

701
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:14,860
(Perfect)

702
00:24:14,866 --> 00:24:16,460
(Powerful)

703
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:17,930
- Without a run-up? - There you go.

704
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,930
(After a quick roll, he lands perfectly.)

705
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,670
(Jae Seok nails the 60cm-high bar.)

706
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:23,740
Yes!

707
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:26,270
- Good! - He's so strong.

708
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,480
(Jae Seok's success threatens the other teams.)

709
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,980
Do you want to try? You can do it, right?

710
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,450
- Kwang Soo will try. - What a man.

711
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,850
- Yes! - He's a man.

712
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,380
The fourth round will be hard.

713
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,680
Do your best.

714
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:36,950
Who is up next? Team Sweet Potato?

715
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:38,190
- Kwang Soo! - Yes.

716
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,350
(Next up is Kwang Soo from Team Sweet Potato.)

717
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:42,190
Kwang Soo is too tall.

718
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:44,060
But he's strong too.

719
00:24:44,062 --> 00:24:47,005
He's good at chin-ups.

720
00:24:47,532 --> 00:24:48,560
You can do it, right?

721
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,760
(We trust you.)

722
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:52,030
Ready.

723
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:55,615
(He'll try a backward roll on the 60cm-high bar.)

724
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,700
You can do it!

725
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:58,410
(If he fails, his team will be out.)

726
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,085
(His legs are turned over.)

727
00:25:02,214 --> 00:25:04,080
(He might succeed.)

728
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:05,410
Hold on.

729
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,850
(Wait)

730
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,820
Fail.

731
00:25:09,821 --> 00:25:14,065
(He did roll over, but...)

732
00:25:14,392 --> 00:25:18,235
(His private part got injured.)

733
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:21,105
(He can't control his body.)

734
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:25,500
(Kwang Soo's sacrifice deserves respect.)

735
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,970
- Fail. - Is it a fail?

736
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:28,815
- Are you okay? - It's a fail.

737
00:25:28,974 --> 00:25:32,485
(Team Sweet Potato is out.)

738
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:34,440
My goodness.

739
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,140
It must have hurt a lot.

740
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:38,850
(You guys carry on. Let me take a break.)

741
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,110
Next.

742
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:41,750
It's like the finals.

743
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:42,780
It's her turn, right?

744
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:44,320
(Next up is Jihyo from Team Suyuk.)

745
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:46,090
Stay close to the bar.

746
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:47,250
Jihyo...

747
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:48,860
Also, roll quickly.

748
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,990
Tuck your head in.

749
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:52,760
Stay close to the bar.

750
00:25:52,764 --> 00:25:54,230
(If Jihyo fails, Team Suyuk will be out.)

751
00:25:54,232 --> 00:25:56,175
That's how you do it.

752
00:25:56,334 --> 00:25:58,830
(Jihyo is going to try to roll over the 60cm-high bar.)

753
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,485
(Rolling)

754
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,640
(After a quick roll, she lands perfectly.)

755
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,600
- Good job. - That was amazing.

756
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:06,270
You did an amazing job.

757
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:08,340
You did the best job so far.

758
00:26:08,346 --> 00:26:09,510
Jihyo.

759
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:11,440
- You did the best job. - You did the best job.

760
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:12,650
I'll do a forward roll.

761
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:14,110
A forward roll is better.

762
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,450
Jihyo.

763
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:17,080
Team Rice is out.

764
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,420
Team Sweet Potato and Team Rice are out.

765
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,150
It's Team Ramyeon versus Team Suyuk.

766
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,235
(The bar is lowered to 50cm.)

767
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:24,990
It's the finals.

768
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:27,060
If we lose, the damage will be big.

769
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,330
(It's Jong Kook versus Se Chan.)

770
00:26:28,333 --> 00:26:29,760
The bar is so low. How are they going to roll over it?

771
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,600
I hope both of them will fail.

772
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:32,930
The head would touch the ground.

773
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:34,745
We have to...

774
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,240
Can you do a forward roll?

775
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,500
(Se Chan from Team Ramyeon will try first.)

776
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:40,670
- Give it a try. - You can't practice.

777
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,680
(Jong Kook keeps him in check.)

778
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,510
- Can't I practice? - No.

779
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,050
(The competition is fierce even from the start.)

780
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,110
Gosh, do you want to defeat me that badly?

781
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,680
He won't go easy.

782
00:26:49,688 --> 00:26:52,365
We put a lot at stake this time.

783
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:54,420
Nayeon.

784
00:26:54,426 --> 00:26:57,520
(She's so curious that she wants to try it.)

785
00:26:57,529 --> 00:26:59,390
(Let's try it.)

786
00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:01,405
(She falls down.)

787
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,560
(Her head lands successfully.)

788
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:04,630
Nayeon.

789
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:05,800
(It's harder than I thought.)

790
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:09,000
Are you okay, Nayeon?

791
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,870
Hey, you can get stuck.

792
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:11,870
Come on, ramyeon.

793
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:13,810
- Let's go, Se Chan. - Let's go.

794
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:16,810
- Let's go. - I'm certain that he can't do it.

795
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,110
You can do it.

796
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:19,925
He can't do it.

797
00:27:20,151 --> 00:27:22,220
Don't lean on your stomach. It should be lower.

798
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,080
Be quick.

799
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,290
Turn quickly.

800
00:27:27,292 --> 00:27:29,335
Se Chan, do it.

801
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:30,520
Be quick.

802
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:32,090
(If he fails, Team Ramyeon is eliminated.)

803
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:33,090
(He's very nervous.)

804
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,830
You must turn quickly.

805
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:40,045
(The bar height is very low. Will Se Chan succeed?)

806
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,015
(He falls off.)

807
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,825
(He lands on his face.)

808
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,480
(Se Chan fails.)

809
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,355
Hey.

810
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:51,810
(It's a very sad yet funny way to fail.)

811
00:27:51,816 --> 00:27:53,580
My goodness.

812
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:56,135
(People pretend not to see it.)

813
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:58,690
(It's sad but funny.)

814
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,420
- Are you okay, Se Chan? - Are you okay?

815
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:02,790
- Tell everyone to leave. - Are you okay?

816
00:28:02,794 --> 00:28:05,260
- I'm okay. - My goodness.

817
00:28:05,263 --> 00:28:07,130
- Seriously. - Goodness.

818
00:28:07,132 --> 00:28:08,400
(We'll pretend we didn't see it.)

819
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
This is frustrating.

820
00:28:10,402 --> 00:28:11,600
(It's so embarrassing.)

821
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:13,500
I'm so embarrassed.

822
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:15,600
Se Chan usually does it better.

823
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,600
Let's go.

824
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:17,770
(Team Ramyeon fails.)

825
00:28:17,776 --> 00:28:19,510
- My goodness. - Next team, go.

826
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:20,810
- Is it our turn now? - Yes.

827
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,810
Is it our turn?

828
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:22,810
(Let's try the hanging bar.)

829
00:28:22,814 --> 00:28:25,810
- This is... - Jong Kook is next.

830
00:28:25,817 --> 00:28:30,120
He's been working out for over 20 years for today.

831
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,590
- For today. - This is short.

832
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,465
(His 20 years of weightlifting will be put to test.)

833
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:39,490
(I've been training my back muscles. Are you ready?)

834
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:42,360
Jong Kook's sense of pride is on the line.

835
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,700
- Seriously. - He'll win.

836
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:45,730
This will be amazing.

837
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:48,370
- Jong Kook will look good doing it. - What will happen?

838
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:49,370
Here I go.

839
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,215
(He's nervous.)

840
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:54,985
(He tries flipping over backwards over a bar of 50cm in height.)

841
00:28:55,513 --> 00:28:59,025
(He does it with ease.)

842
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:03,235
(He turns once without using any force.)

843
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,290
(Team Suyuk clears the hanging bar mission.)

844
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,650
Good job.

845
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:09,220
- You should have gone last. - I know.

846
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,390
He did it.

847
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:12,630
(They're amazed by Jong Kook's physical skills.)

848
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,390
- Let's move on. - He did it.

849
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,260
- Take 30. - Okay.

850
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:17,830
We won 30.

851
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:20,370
- I should have gone last. - Thank you.

852
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:21,900
This is great.

853
00:29:21,906 --> 00:29:23,800
Our team is amazing.

854
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:25,940
I thought it'd take longer, but it didn't.

855
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:27,010
All right.

856
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:28,210
(Shall I try it?)

857
00:29:28,213 --> 00:29:30,010
You have to do it like this.

858
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:33,265
- All the way. - It requires abs and arm strength.

859
00:29:34,285 --> 00:29:36,950
What's the point of me doing it?

860
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,950
(He gives up right away.)

861
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:41,420
When he grabbed the bar, he realized that it's impossible.

862
00:29:41,426 --> 00:29:42,720
Gosh, Jae Seok.

863
00:29:42,727 --> 00:29:44,990
Just give it a try.

864
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,690
- Give it a try. - Okay.

865
00:29:46,698 --> 00:29:49,130
- Give it a try. - I will.

866
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:50,600
I bet all of my money that he can't do it.

867
00:29:50,602 --> 00:29:52,300
- Really? - I'll let you treat me like...

868
00:29:52,303 --> 00:29:53,500
a younger brother if you succeed.

869
00:29:53,505 --> 00:29:55,500
- Do you promise? Really? - Of course.

870
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:57,900
If Jae Seok makes it, you'll always be considered younger than him.

871
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:59,270
Seok Jin promised.

872
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,295
- Jae Seok can do it. - No, he can't.

873
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,310
- He can't do it. - It's possible.

874
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:08,380
(Hierarchy between Seok Jin and Jae Seok depends on this bet.)

875
00:30:08,386 --> 00:30:11,280
(Will Jae Seok make it?)

876
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:13,765
(Thankfully he fails.)

877
00:30:14,692 --> 00:30:18,090
(Jae Seok is nice enough to keep Seok Jin's sense of pride.)

878
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,830
I got stuck.

879
00:30:19,831 --> 00:30:20,830
(Round 1 is finished.)

880
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:23,000
How is that possible?

881
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:26,185
Can we play games that we can do?

882
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:30,315
Round Two is called Wrap, Yes or Yes.

883
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:31,810
I'm confident.

884
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,370
I'm good at eating it.

885
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:36,495
Having a big mouth is an advantage.

886
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,210
I have a very big mouth.

887
00:30:38,216 --> 00:30:39,210
Do you?

888
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:41,050
(She opens her mouth wide.)

889
00:30:41,052 --> 00:30:42,750
- Nayeon is amazing. - That's cheating.

890
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:44,280
Women have bigger mouths.

891
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:46,620
Listen, our team members seem promising.

892
00:30:46,624 --> 00:30:50,060
(TWICE members show off the size of their mouths.)

893
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,320
- The wrap can go in. - It's big enough.

894
00:30:51,329 --> 00:30:53,360
- It's possible. - Isn't it big?

895
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:56,100
(It's best to assign members with big mouths last.)

896
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:58,870
- Momo should go first and second. - First and second.

897
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,045
- You're third. - You're fourth.

898
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:02,700
Here you go.

899
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,400
(Tzuyu is assigned last.)

900
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:05,640
Is Tzuyu last?

901
00:31:05,643 --> 00:31:07,740
Is Tzuyu going last?

902
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:11,410
Everyone, we'll show you Tunnel Number One at Mount Nam.

903
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,410
Tzuyu.

904
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:15,480
(Her mouth is big enough for a wrap to go through.)

905
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:18,020
- Not a lot will go in. - We're not listening.

906
00:31:18,022 --> 00:31:20,150
Jihyo has a big mouth too.

907
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,920
Mine is Tunnel Number Two at Mount Nam.

908
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:24,990
- Tunnel Number Two? - Show us your mouth, Jihyo.

909
00:31:24,996 --> 00:31:28,715
(Her mouth is big enough as well.)

910
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,630
Jihyo has a big mouth too.

911
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:33,470
Is this the order?

912
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:34,770
Is Mina going last?

913
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:37,115
No, she's just sitting here.

914
00:31:37,442 --> 00:31:38,610
(Let TWICE join the game.)

915
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,610
- Let TWICE play the game. - Let them play.

916
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:43,140
Seok Jin or Kwang Soo can stay out.

917
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:45,610
Either Seok Jin or Kwang Soo should stay out.

918
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:47,010
TWICE should play.

919
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:49,795
- Seriously. - The audience wants Mina to play.

920
00:31:49,821 --> 00:31:51,480
- Should we make her play? - Mina should join.

921
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:52,620
Why are the others playing?

922
00:31:52,624 --> 00:31:55,160
People left many comments about you.

923
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,520
Shall we have Mina play?

924
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:58,420
Don't push Mina away.

925
00:31:58,429 --> 00:31:59,860
(He plays with words.)

926
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:01,190
Okay, Mina, you should play.

927
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,630
- That's right. She should play. - Go, Mina.

928
00:32:03,635 --> 00:32:05,670
- Shall I stay out? - You shouldn't.

929
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:08,000
- How about this? - Don't make Mina stay out.

930
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,740
- Come here, Dahyun. - Step up, Dahyun.

931
00:32:10,742 --> 00:32:12,870
Are you taking out Dahyun?

932
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,825
You're insane.

933
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:18,555
- Show us Dahyun. - Show us Dahyun.

934
00:32:19,717 --> 00:32:21,210
It's our strategy.

935
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:22,620
(We're taking out members with small mouths.)

936
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,895
The other team gets to strategize.

937
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,150
Have a seat and play, Dahyun.

938
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:28,320
(Dahyun joins the game again.)

939
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:29,975
Wait.

940
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,390
- What should we do? - Hurry up.

941
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:34,190
Seok Jin should stay out.

942
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,700
- Dahyun, you have to eat. - Okay.

943
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,300
- I'll stay out. - Okay.

944
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:41,770
(Everyone is quiet.)

945
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:43,900
No one is protesting.

946
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,910
Whom were you talking to?

947
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,210
When he said, "I'll stay out", it only echoed.

948
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,280
"I'll stay out", "I'll stay out".

949
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:52,110
No one is protesting.

950
00:32:52,116 --> 00:32:54,150
- This is good. It's quiet now. - This is great.

951
00:32:54,152 --> 00:32:55,220
(Their peaceful agreement is made.)

952
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,150
- Let's go. - Let's play.

953
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:59,020
Now everyone is quiet.

954
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:01,150
Now the world is at peace.

955
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,920
Here comes the first wrap.

956
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,320
(They try the wrap at level 1.)

957
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:05,830
This is great.

958
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,660
The first one is cute.

959
00:33:07,665 --> 00:33:10,300
That looks delicious. We can definitely eat it.

960
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:12,075
Start with So Min.

961
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,900
You're doing a good job.

962
00:33:13,905 --> 00:33:15,670
- Sana. - Sana.

963
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,670
(Everyone including Sana, Momo, and Mina succeed.)

964
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:19,010
You look pretty.

965
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,010
- Isn't it spicy? - Sana.

966
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,940
(It's just like finger food.)

967
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:25,380
Second players, come out.

968
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,610
Chili and garlic are added.

969
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:28,850
- Jeongyeon looks good. - There it goes.

970
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,850
Nayeon, you look like your jaw is dislocated.

971
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:31,880
That's right.

972
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,120
- Nayeon, she's so confident. - Look at Nayeon.

973
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,790
Nayeon looks confident.

974
00:33:35,793 --> 00:33:37,920
- Third players, come out. - Okay.

975
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:38,930
(Wrap at level 3)

976
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,260
- Let's go, team. - Let's go.

977
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:43,375
Start.

978
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:45,885
(Haha from Team Rice starts.)

979
00:33:46,271 --> 00:33:48,300
- It's impossible. - It won't be possible.

980
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:50,200
It's much bigger than I thought.

981
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,670
Garlic is falling out.

982
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:52,910
(A clove of garlic falls out.)

983
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:54,370
He's out.

984
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:55,740
- He's eliminated. - It can't fall out.

985
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,110
He's out.

986
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,410
Here goes Jihyo.

987
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,910
She can't closer her mouth.

988
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:02,420
Jihyo's mouth is small.

989
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,420
She got it. She did it.

990
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:05,650
She did it. That was perfect.

991
00:34:05,657 --> 00:34:06,650
(She succeeds perfectly.)

992
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:08,760
Okay, go, Jae Seok.

993
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,060
- Put it in. - He has a big mouth.

994
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,445
(He fails as garlic falls out.)

995
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:13,490
Who's next?

996
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:16,115
(Dahyun opens her mouth wide.)

997
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:18,830
- Face the camera. - Dahyun.

998
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:19,830
(Her wrap disappears.)

999
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:21,845
She made it.

1000
00:34:22,006 --> 00:34:24,400
(Only Jong Kook and Kwang Soo are left.)

1001
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:26,410
Fourth players, come out.

1002
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,110
The last level will be difficult.

1003
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,110
I bet it'll be huge.

1004
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:33,880
(A gigantic wrap at level 4 arrives.)

1005
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:36,920
- It's too big. Look at that. - There it is.

1006
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:39,865
(What does level 4 look like?)

1007
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,020
Level four is difficult.

1008
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:44,135
It's too big.

1009
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,430
This is...

1010
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,490
(The one who puts everything inside his mouth wins.)

1011
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:48,590
How is it possible to put it in?

1012
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,600
The throat will hurt.

1013
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,670
- Tear everything and put it in. - In the large one?

1014
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,670
Yes.

1015
00:34:53,671 --> 00:34:56,100
- Is this more advantageous? - Yes.

1016
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:57,600
This is possible, right?

1017
00:34:57,608 --> 00:34:58,910
Even I can do it.

1018
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,570
We haven't put meat in yet.

1019
00:35:00,578 --> 00:35:02,110
(They haven't put in pork belly meat yet.)

1020
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,955
We can't put it in.

1021
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:05,850
This isn't possible to eat.

1022
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:07,825
It's too big.

1023
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,020
(His wrap is large too.)

1024
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:11,680
Let's just do it.

1025
00:35:11,689 --> 00:35:13,320
- It's too big. - It's impossible.

1026
00:35:13,324 --> 00:35:15,775
I don't think you can eat it.

1027
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:17,490
(He warms up his jaw.)

1028
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:20,505
Let's go. You can do it.

1029
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:23,000
(He's very nervous.)

1030
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
Go, Jong Kook.

1031
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:25,670
(Jong Kook attempts to eat wrap at level 4.)

1032
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,285
This is...

1033
00:35:27,805 --> 00:35:29,840
It'll be difficult.

1034
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,470
Jong Kook can't even open his eyes.

1035
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:33,310
(The gigantic wrap goes in little by little.)

1036
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:36,010
- Even Jong Kook can't do it. - It's going in.

1037
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:38,010
No, stop it, Jong Kook.

1038
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,025
- Stop it, Jong Kook. - Stop it.

1039
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:41,710
It's about to tear open his cheeks.

1040
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:43,620
- Look at his cheeks. - He's being competitive.

1041
00:35:43,621 --> 00:35:45,420
You don't need to go that far.

1042
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:48,605
- Save Jong Kook. - Are you okay?

1043
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,760
- He fails. - Jong Kook tried to do it...

1044
00:35:50,762 --> 00:35:52,690
with his mentality, but it's impossible.

1045
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:54,360
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1046
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,500
Wait.

1047
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
(If he wins, Team Sweet Potato wins.)

1048
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:59,585
Even if his mouth is big, it will be hard.

1049
00:35:59,637 --> 00:36:01,570
He's putting on lip balm.

1050
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:03,200
His mouth might tear.

1051
00:36:03,207 --> 00:36:05,255
His mouth became red.

1052
00:36:05,943 --> 00:36:07,810
Here goes Kwang Soo.

1053
00:36:07,812 --> 00:36:09,110
(Kwang Soo starts.)

1054
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:11,680
That's good. Go, let's go.

1055
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:14,580
It isn't easy. It's spilling.

1056
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:16,420
Is his mouth that big?

1057
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:19,420
- No way. - That's not possible.

1058
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,565
(How does it go in?)

1059
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:24,790
(He succeeds if he closes his mouth.)

1060
00:36:24,796 --> 00:36:26,690
This is what I do for a hobby.

1061
00:36:26,697 --> 00:36:28,805
I can't watch anymore.

1062
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,730
(He puts in every little piece.)

1063
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,485
You got it.

1064
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:35,770
(He puts everything inside.)

1065
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,115
He can't be human.

1066
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:41,940
(Team Sweet Potato wins the wrap game.)

1067
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:43,040
He did it!

1068
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:46,165
(I admit my defeat.)

1069
00:36:46,984 --> 00:36:48,820
Team Sweet Potato wins the second round.

1070
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,920
Amazing!

1071
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,250
(Team Sweet Potato wins Round 2.)

1072
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:52,790
Team Sweet Potato...

1073
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,290
bet 20 cabbage leaves, so they win 20 more.

1074
00:36:55,293 --> 00:36:58,390
(Team Sweet Potato wins 20 cabbage leaves.)

1075
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,205
Good job, Kwang Soo.

1076
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:01,660
Here we go.

1077
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,900
The third game is Pig Ssireum.

1078
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:06,000
(Pig Ssireum)

1079
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:08,800
1 player from each team will compete, so 4 in total.

1080
00:37:08,806 --> 00:37:10,900
You have to push the others so that their fingers come unlaced...

1081
00:37:10,908 --> 00:37:13,010
or they get out of the area.

1082
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,580
When someone is out, the next player takes over within five seconds.

1083
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:19,980
The team whose member lasts longest wins.

1084
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:21,510
(The team that lasts longest wins.)

1085
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,795
How many should we bet?

1086
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:24,980
I'm not sure.

1087
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,090
This is hard.

1088
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:29,390
- They might target you. - That's right.

1089
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:31,090
We should bet just a little.

1090
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,230
Let's pass this game too.

1091
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:35,605
Let's go for the next game.

1092
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:38,160
- Let's give it our all. - How many do we have left?

1093
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,400
(We might not be able to win many cabbage leaves.)

1094
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:41,170
We have...

1095
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:43,315
Should we steal some?

1096
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,970
Should we steal some?

1097
00:37:45,977 --> 00:37:47,510
(Jeongyeon suggests that they steal some cabbage leaves.)

1098
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:48,740
(Let's do that.)

1099
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,210
Okay.

1100
00:37:50,214 --> 00:37:52,810
(Team Rice's strategy is to make small bets and steal others'.)

1101
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,025
Watch how we do it.

1102
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:57,980
The first players.

1103
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,220
Go to your positions.

1104
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,865
(Line-ups and Bets)

1105
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:02,690
- Guys. - Go, So Min!

1106
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:06,860
Team up and eliminate Jae Seok first.

1107
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,560
- Let's do that. - Hold on.

1108
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:10,660
(Are you serious?)

1109
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,060
- Let's team up. - Let's do that!

1110
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:13,470
(They're ready for a joint attack.)

1111
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,030
Sana!

1112
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,200
Go, So Min!

1113
00:38:18,209 --> 00:38:19,340
(Shouting)

1114
00:38:19,343 --> 00:38:21,085
How many?

1115
00:38:21,212 --> 00:38:22,640
Seven.

1116
00:38:22,647 --> 00:38:25,055
(Haha secretly checks what Jeongyeon has brought.)

1117
00:38:25,082 --> 00:38:26,250
I think I can steal some.

1118
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,180
(A moment ago)

1119
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:32,220
Jeongyeon, go behind the wall.

1120
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:36,060
(Team Rice sends Jeongyeon behind the wall...)

1121
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,130
(and distracts the others with loud cheers.)

1122
00:38:40,131 --> 00:38:42,960
(Meanwhile, Jeongyeon approaches Team Sweet Potato...)

1123
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,245
(and steals a handful of cabbage leaves.)

1124
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,140
(Okay, everything is going well.)

1125
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,200
(We have so many cabbage leaves now.)

1126
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,570
Ready.

1127
00:38:52,577 --> 00:38:54,685
Sana!

1128
00:38:55,146 --> 00:38:56,540
(Let's start our joint attack.)

1129
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:58,540
I mean... Guys.

1130
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:00,250
- Let's go. - Think about it.

1131
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,680
Especially you.

1132
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:03,780
We don't have many cabbage leaves.

1133
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,320
Jae Seok, hang in there.

1134
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:06,490
- Turn your back. - Hang in there!

1135
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,250
We don't have many cabbage leaves. You can't do this to me.

1136
00:39:08,259 --> 00:39:09,660
(Jae Seok is surrounded.)

1137
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,645
(Sana kicks him.)

1138
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:14,690
Jae Seok is out.

1139
00:39:14,699 --> 00:39:16,975
No! Jae Seok!

1140
00:39:17,335 --> 00:39:19,170
Jae Seok is out. Who's next?

1141
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,900
Momo, go in.

1142
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:21,930
Momo, go all the way in.

1143
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:24,470
(The alliance breaks.)

1144
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:26,740
Help me!

1145
00:39:26,744 --> 00:39:27,970
Momo.

1146
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:30,040
(Sana kicks So Min too.)

1147
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:31,540
(So Min from Team Rice is eliminated.)

1148
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:32,610
So Min is out.

1149
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,380
Your legs. There you go!

1150
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:35,380
Momo, step back.

1151
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:36,920
(So Min out, Haha in.)

1152
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,820
Momo, watch your back.

1153
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:41,650
(Sana kicks Momo too.)

1154
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,660
(Sana has eliminated 3 people in a row.)

1155
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:45,060
- Out! - Sana is the best!

1156
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,130
Go, Sana!

1157
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,490
- Sana is amazing! - She's incredible!

1158
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,800
(Who should I eliminate next?)

1159
00:39:51,802 --> 00:39:54,685
(Momo out, Se Chan in)

1160
00:39:55,573 --> 00:39:57,770
- Let's attack Se Chan first. - No.

1161
00:39:57,775 --> 00:39:59,440
(Pushing)

1162
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:01,040
Let's go.

1163
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:04,280
(As soon as he sits down,)

1164
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:07,410
(Mina pushes him out.)

1165
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:08,650
(Go get some rest.)

1166
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,250
Mina!

1167
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:11,580
- Mina did an amazing job. - Mina!

1168
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,220
- Mina, Nayeon is behind you! - Mina!

1169
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:14,790
Mina is amazing!

1170
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:16,090
- Mina did an amazing job. - Mina!

1171
00:40:16,093 --> 00:40:17,460
- Mina, Nayeon is behind you! - Mina!

1172
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:19,590
(Kicking)

1173
00:40:19,597 --> 00:40:23,130
(Did you just kick me?)

1174
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,915
Nayeon, be careful!

1175
00:40:25,202 --> 00:40:27,230
(Nayeon is eliminated right away.)

1176
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:28,330
Sana is amazing!

1177
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,815
- Team Ramyeon is out. - My team...

1178
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:33,070
- What's wrong with my team? - Out!

1179
00:40:33,077 --> 00:40:35,825
(Should we eliminate Haha?)

1180
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:38,010
(Mina pushes Haha.)

1181
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,610
Haha. Who is next?

1182
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,365
So Min. It's inside.

1183
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,780
Gosh, it's so funny.

1184
00:40:43,788 --> 00:40:45,520
Are we the only ones left?

1185
00:40:45,523 --> 00:40:46,520
No.

1186
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,265
(No way.)

1187
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,420
(Jeongyeon versus Mina versus Sana)

1188
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,690
Mina won't fall.

1189
00:40:51,696 --> 00:40:54,960
- With her legs apart... - She won't fall.

1190
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:58,260
(What? Mina won't fall?)

1191
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:02,200
(Sana will make her fall.)

1192
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:07,725
(Between these strong contestants, who is going to win?)

1193
00:41:07,778 --> 00:41:10,555
(Sana pushes Mina.)

1194
00:41:10,948 --> 00:41:13,725
(Mina is out.)

1195
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,380
Sana will survive to the end.

1196
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:17,420
(Sana is incredible.)

1197
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:19,290
Sana is unbelievable.

1198
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,020
Jeongyeon is out.

1199
00:41:21,025 --> 00:41:22,690
(Sana eliminates Jeongyeon as well.)

1200
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:24,760
(By eliminating Tzuyu,)

1201
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:27,590
(she eliminates the whole Team Rice.)

1202
00:41:27,598 --> 00:41:29,400
Is Sana the first player?

1203
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,675
- She is. - She is?

1204
00:41:31,902 --> 00:41:33,130
(Sana is exhausted.)

1205
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:34,370
Go, Chaeyoung!

1206
00:41:34,371 --> 00:41:36,070
(Chaeyoung attacks Sana while she is exhausted.)

1207
00:41:36,073 --> 00:41:38,200
Push her down!

1208
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:39,925
Sana!

1209
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:41,470
No! Chaeyoung!

1210
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,040
(Strong defense versus strong offense)

1211
00:41:43,047 --> 00:41:45,950
(With her legs, Sana resists against Chaeyoung's attack.)

1212
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,950
(But her foot gets out.)

1213
00:41:49,954 --> 00:41:53,390
(Sana is finally eliminated.)

1214
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,690
Sana...

1215
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:56,990
Sana, you're amazing!

1216
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:58,960
I'm scared.

1217
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:00,090
Chaeyoung.

1218
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:03,360
(Chaeyoung eliminates Jihyo from Team Suyuk.)

1219
00:42:03,367 --> 00:42:04,760
- It's dangerous. - Ji Hyo!

1220
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:07,630
(Ji Hyo, with 8 years' experience, eliminates Chaeyoung right away.)

1221
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:10,070
- Both of you should go in. - Go in.

1222
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:11,300
Kwang Soo, go in.

1223
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:14,070
Dahyun, go for Jong Kook.

1224
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:16,995
Attack Jong Kook!

1225
00:42:17,214 --> 00:42:21,065
(Have you ever been attacked by toes?)

1226
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:23,420
Good.

1227
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,850
Dahyun is out.

1228
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,950
(Dahyun from Team Sweet Potato is out.)

1229
00:42:26,957 --> 00:42:27,950
Good.

1230
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:30,920
(Dahyun is out?)

1231
00:42:30,928 --> 00:42:33,460
(I want you out too.)

1232
00:42:33,464 --> 00:42:35,830
(No way.)

1233
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:38,230
(It's time for test signals.)

1234
00:42:38,235 --> 00:42:39,500
(Screaming)

1235
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:40,670
(Suffering)

1236
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:41,770
Done.

1237
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:44,540
(What's going on?)

1238
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:46,310
(So many things happened.)

1239
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,310
It's so funny.

1240
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:48,410
Good job, Ji Hyo.

1241
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,310
(Although we can't show you everything, Team Suyuk wins.)

1242
00:42:50,314 --> 00:42:52,310
With your cabbage leaves,

1243
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:55,150
you can buy a hint and make a guess.

1244
00:42:55,152 --> 00:42:58,120
You can see each age group's choice directly.

1245
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,965
We can see it?

1246
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,120
I want to know what people in their 30s chose.

1247
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,920
Number-one choice of people in their 30s?

1248
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:05,220
Number-one choice of people in their 30s.

1249
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,290
There you go.

1250
00:43:06,297 --> 00:43:10,400
(Team Suyuk buys a hint for the 1st choice of people in their 30s.)

1251
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:12,000
44 percent?

1252
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:13,430
- Really? - I had no idea.

1253
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:14,770
That's unexpected.

1254
00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:16,370
(44 percent of the people in their 30s chose ramyeon.)

1255
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:18,815
- Jeongyeon did it. - What should we choose?

1256
00:43:18,909 --> 00:43:21,040
- What should we choose? - I choose people in their 20s.

1257
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:22,540
Let's do that.

1258
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:25,080
(Team Rice buys a hint for the 1st choice of people in their 20s.)

1259
00:43:25,082 --> 00:43:27,950
(What did people in their 20s choose as kimchi's partner?)

1260
00:43:27,952 --> 00:43:29,350
(It's ramyeon again.)

1261
00:43:29,353 --> 00:43:31,295
44 percent chose it.

1262
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:33,990
(44 percent of people in their 20s and 30s...)

1263
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:36,120
(chose ramyeon as kimchi's true partner.)

1264
00:43:36,126 --> 00:43:37,860
Can we win more cabbage leaves in the next round?

1265
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:38,960
Yes.

1266
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,660
We can win more. Let's go for 50.

1267
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:43,060
We should go for 50. We can win more.

1268
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,460
How many do we have left?

1269
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:46,070
- 8. - 8?

1270
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:47,870
(They count their cabbage leaves.)

1271
00:43:47,872 --> 00:43:49,200
Hold on.

1272
00:43:49,206 --> 00:43:51,070
(They count their cabbage leaves.)

1273
00:43:51,075 --> 00:43:52,670
- Some are missing. - Some are missing.

1274
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:54,270
We won 20 in the beginning...

1275
00:43:54,278 --> 00:43:55,670
- and then... - Why do we have less?

1276
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:57,510
(Some of the cabbage leaves are missing.)

1277
00:43:57,514 --> 00:43:58,680
(Team Sweet Potato finally realizes their cabbage leaves are missing.)

1278
00:43:58,682 --> 00:44:00,750
Why do we have less? How many are we supposed to have?

1279
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,080
We're supposed to have 49.

1280
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:04,920
- But we have less than that. - What happened?

1281
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:06,190
We're supposed to have 52.

1282
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,020
- We're supposed to have 52. - We have less.

1283
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:09,620
(It's a perfect crime.)

1284
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:10,890
Someone must have stolen them.

1285
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,520
(Now I get it.)

1286
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:13,590
That's right.

1287
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:15,905
I told you to keep an eye on them.

1288
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,560
Seriously?

1289
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:19,275
Okay.

1290
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:21,300
I've chosen my path for today.

1291
00:44:21,305 --> 00:44:22,640
Now I understand how it works.

1292
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,800
(So this is how you play?)

1293
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:26,640
(Why didn't you tell me before?)

1294
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:29,110
Now I understand how this game works.

1295
00:44:29,113 --> 00:44:30,310
- Okay. - Okay.

1296
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:32,480
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

1297
00:44:32,483 --> 00:44:34,110
It's going to be so fun today.

1298
00:44:34,118 --> 00:44:35,150
Let's do it.

1299
00:44:35,152 --> 00:44:37,250
(Round 1 is over. What game is waiting for them next?)

1300
00:44:37,254 --> 00:44:40,090
(Round 2, Tanhyeon SBS sports field)

1301
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:43,090
(It looks like a shot put area. What game are they going to play?)

1302
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:45,090
Stand in teams.

1303
00:44:45,095 --> 00:44:46,730
Kwang Soo, can you clap your hands once?

1304
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,560
Okay.

1305
00:44:48,565 --> 00:44:50,900
Come back in.

1306
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:53,270
(They suddenly attack him.)

1307
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,870
Ha Seok Ju, come back in!

1308
00:44:54,872 --> 00:44:56,340
(It's so fun to tease Kwang Soo.)

1309
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,555
Why is he so full of energy today?

1310
00:45:00,277 --> 00:45:02,210
Your hair is too long on the back.

1311
00:45:02,212 --> 00:45:03,510
TWICE should do it.

1312
00:45:03,514 --> 00:45:05,280
Jeongyeon is going to do it.

1313
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:07,080
1, 2, 3.

1314
00:45:07,084 --> 00:45:08,410
Nice!

1315
00:45:08,419 --> 00:45:11,695
(Kwang Soo is missing.)

1316
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:13,750
(Even before Round 2, Kwang Soo is exhausted.)

1317
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,790
- Come back in. - You know how they are.

1318
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:17,820
(How should I get back at them?)

1319
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,630
You can win more hints in this game.

1320
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:23,500
It's called Flying Wig Shot Put.

1321
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,360
(Flying Wig Shot Put)

1322
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,130
At the starting line, you will...

1323
00:45:28,138 --> 00:45:30,140
throw your wig off your head.

1324
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,540
The area your wig lands in will determine how many points you win.

1325
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:35,980
The team can win as many cabbage leaves as the points combined.

1326
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:38,410
There are four types of wigs.

1327
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:39,880
Bald, short,

1328
00:45:39,883 --> 00:45:42,625
curly, and long.

1329
00:45:42,853 --> 00:45:44,120
The bald one is the best...

1330
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,390
- because it's heavy. - That's right.

1331
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,720
We'll play a simple game, and the winner will distribute the wigs.

1332
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:52,860
Since we have as many as 17 people today,

1333
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:55,860
let's play Race of Wits.

1334
00:45:55,866 --> 00:45:57,660
Jae Seok's Race of Wits has started.

1335
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:59,515
He looks so happy.

1336
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:03,040
- What's with your hands? - Why do you like it so much?

1337
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,440
I've never played it with 17 people.

1338
00:46:05,442 --> 00:46:06,970
- Okay. - It's never been bigger.

1339
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,740
- He looks so happy. - My hands are shaking.

1340
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:10,010
Ready.

1341
00:46:10,014 --> 00:46:11,410
I'm going to say, "one".

1342
00:46:11,415 --> 00:46:12,680
I'm definitely saying, "one".

1343
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:15,250
Ready, start.

1344
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:17,035
- 1. - 1.

1345
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:18,720
Ji Hyo.

1346
00:46:18,722 --> 00:46:20,920
(Ji Hyo and So Min are out.)

1347
00:46:20,924 --> 00:46:22,090
- They're out. - They're out.

1348
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:24,620
So Min and Ji Hyo are out.

1349
00:46:24,628 --> 00:46:25,860
Step aside.

1350
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,905
It's dangerous to say, "one", in the beginning.

1351
00:46:28,465 --> 00:46:30,600
(I survived.)

1352
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,530
With the reckless ones out, it's my turn now.

1353
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:35,230
1, 1...

1354
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:37,240
Ready, start.

1355
00:46:37,241 --> 00:46:38,700
One.

1356
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:40,325
Two.

1357
00:46:40,344 --> 00:46:41,570
- 3. - 4.

1358
00:46:41,578 --> 00:46:43,010
Five.

1359
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:44,480
Six.

1360
00:46:44,481 --> 00:46:45,640
- 7. - 7.

1361
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:46,950
Both of them said seven.

1362
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,010
- 7. - 7.

1363
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:51,450
I said it first.

1364
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:53,720
- He said it first. - I said it first.

1365
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:54,890
Really?

1366
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:56,460
- Then eight. - He said it first.

1367
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,190
(I'll go with 8.)

1368
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,990
That doesn't work.

1369
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:01,090
What?

1370
00:47:01,098 --> 00:47:03,375
- What was that? - Isn't he eliminated?

1371
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,600
Mister.

1372
00:47:04,601 --> 00:47:06,070
Get out, mister.

1373
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:07,330
My bad.

1374
00:47:07,337 --> 00:47:09,655
He's ridiculous.

1375
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:10,900
That's hilarious.

1376
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,225
(They can't get used to Haha's tricks.)

1377
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,610
- Mister. - What is he doing?

1378
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:17,610
- What was that? - Come on.

1379
00:47:17,614 --> 00:47:20,750
Let's go again. Start.

1380
00:47:20,751 --> 00:47:21,810
One.

1381
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,450
(Jeongyeon calls out 1 as soon as it starts.)

1382
00:47:23,454 --> 00:47:24,920
- 2. - 3.

1383
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:26,250
- 4. - 5.

1384
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:27,850
Six.

1385
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,020
- 7. - 7.

1386
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:31,760
(Dahyun and Tzuyu are out.)

1387
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:33,230
They're out.

1388
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,945
- Tzuyu and Dahyun? - You were so close.

1389
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:38,200
Please go over there.

1390
00:47:38,202 --> 00:47:41,530
Okay.

1391
00:47:41,538 --> 00:47:42,670
Let's go again.

1392
00:47:42,673 --> 00:47:43,700
(All members of Team Ramyeon survived so far.)

1393
00:47:43,707 --> 00:47:44,740
This is good.

1394
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:46,140
We have to start over again.

1395
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:47,570
Only Jeongyeon is left.

1396
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:48,770
(She's from Team Rice.)

1397
00:47:48,779 --> 00:47:51,855
(Jeongyeon is the only survivor from Team Rice.)

1398
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,710
(She must compete against many opponents.)

1399
00:47:53,717 --> 00:47:55,825
Jeongyeon is good at calling out number one.

1400
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,795
(Jeongyeon is good at calling out number one.)

1401
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:03,435
(Jeongyeon survived twice in a row with number 1.)

1402
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,560
- It's okay, Jeongyeon. - She's good with number one.

1403
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:06,860
You'll be our hero...

1404
00:48:06,864 --> 00:48:08,545
if you win.

1405
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,330
- Start. - One.

1406
00:48:10,334 --> 00:48:12,530
(She calls out number 1 again.)

1407
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:13,770
- 2. - 2.

1408
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,500
(Kwang Soo and Nayeon are out.)

1409
00:48:15,506 --> 00:48:17,040
Kwang Soo is eliminated.

1410
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,040
Good job, Nayeon.

1411
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:19,725
One.

1412
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,210
(She always goes for number 1.)

1413
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:22,740
- Start. - One.

1414
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:23,880
- 3. - 3.

1415
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:25,710
(She never loses with number 1.)

1416
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:27,250
Jeongyeon is the best.

1417
00:48:27,251 --> 00:48:29,025
(She's working hard.)

1418
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:30,550
Say one no matter what.

1419
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:31,680
(Only 4 members remain.)

1420
00:48:31,688 --> 00:48:34,150
- Say one no matter what. - By the way,

1421
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,860
are you three working separately from other TWICE members?

1422
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:38,360
Isn't the one on the right your manager?

1423
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:39,890
(Isn't the one on the right your manager?)

1424
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:40,930
Are you their manager?

1425
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,930
- They work as a unit. - Really?

1426
00:48:42,933 --> 00:48:45,060
- We're a unit. - The four of you are fun today.

1427
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:46,830
We like to work together.

1428
00:48:46,837 --> 00:48:48,330
- Get ready. - Say one no matter what.

1429
00:48:48,338 --> 00:48:49,985
Start.

1430
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:54,940
(Will Jeongyeon survive again by calling out number 1?)

1431
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:56,595
- 1. - 1.

1432
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,425
(Jeongyeon and Se Chan are out at the same time.)

1433
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:05,595
(Mina and Chaeyoung win without realizing it.)

1434
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,150
That was clean.

1435
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:08,190
(She fails with number 1.)

1436
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:09,520
It's our first time not playing rock-paper-scissors...

1437
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:11,460
while playing Race of Wits.

1438
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:12,860
It was Jeongyeon.

1439
00:49:12,863 --> 00:49:14,590
- That was close. - She went far.

1440
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,030
Good job.

1441
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,760
- Look at the wigs. - Isn't this the best?

1442
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:18,830
Really?

1443
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,030
- This is the heaviest. - This one?

1444
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:22,400
The heaviest is the best.

1445
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:25,200
- This is... - It's influenced the most by wind.

1446
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,970
Isn't that the best?

1447
00:49:26,977 --> 00:49:28,610
(That's why...)

1448
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:30,710
Wait, we have to think.

1449
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:32,080
(Kwang Soo gives them the worst wig.)

1450
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:34,350
- Think carefully. - Think again.

1451
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:35,980
- You're being impatient. - What do you mean?

1452
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:37,420
Don't ruin the show like this.

1453
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:39,520
What did you say?

1454
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:41,020
Wear this and make kimchi.

1455
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:43,935
(Do you think I'm a fool?)

1456
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:46,260
Put this on and make kimchi later.

1457
00:49:46,263 --> 00:49:47,905
Put it on now.

1458
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:49,490
Put it on now.

1459
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:52,575
(Wigs are distributed.)

1460
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:54,930
(Practice and discussing strategies)

1461
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:56,340
50 would be enough.

1462
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,970
- Won't it be hard to score 50? - Yes.

1463
00:49:57,975 --> 00:50:00,710
We're at 15, so are we going for 50?

1464
00:50:00,711 --> 00:50:01,940
That's right.

1465
00:50:01,945 --> 00:50:04,210
Can we score 15?

1466
00:50:04,214 --> 00:50:06,825
It'll reach 20.

1467
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,565
(Laughing)

1468
00:50:08,752 --> 00:50:10,620
(Running)

1469
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,120
(He runs and shoots.)

1470
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:13,350
(Thud)

1471
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:16,405
(He runs quickly, but the wig doesn't travel far.)

1472
00:50:16,727 --> 00:50:18,590
What is he doing?

1473
00:50:18,595 --> 00:50:21,430
- He ran far, but it landed here. - It didn't travel far.

1474
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:22,960
(He tries again from farther back.)

1475
00:50:22,966 --> 00:50:25,475
(Running forward)

1476
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:28,170
(Swing)

1477
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:29,670
That was good, Kwang Soo.

1478
00:50:29,673 --> 00:50:31,040
You should run from that far.

1479
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:32,240
Poor Kwang Soo.

1480
00:50:32,242 --> 00:50:33,410
Start.

1481
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:35,240
- You're amazing. - Let's go.

1482
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:38,080
Each member from Team Sweet Potato...

1483
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:39,080
will play.

1484
00:50:39,082 --> 00:50:40,310
It's Dahyun's turn.

1485
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:42,350
The first player is Dahyun.

1486
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:43,880
It's fine as long as it isn't negative.

1487
00:50:43,887 --> 00:50:45,635
Throw it farther than here.

1488
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:48,365
10, 15, and 20.

1489
00:50:49,626 --> 00:50:52,590
(Run quickly and gain momentum.)

1490
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,490
(The first player of Team Sweet Potato)

1491
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:58,775
(Where will Dahyun's wig land?)

1492
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:01,230
(It falls in front of her feet.)

1493
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:02,300
What?

1494
00:51:02,306 --> 00:51:05,270
(She's eliminated in an elegant way.)

1495
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:06,670
- Okay. - Wait.

1496
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:07,970
What happened?

1497
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:09,210
- She hasn't started yet. - Start?

1498
00:51:09,212 --> 00:51:10,710
- She hasn't started. - She already started.

1499
00:51:10,714 --> 00:51:12,510
- It's because... - She already started.

1500
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:13,750
Seriously.

1501
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:14,950
(Twisting his arm is the answer.)

1502
00:51:14,951 --> 00:51:16,895
It was her first time.

1503
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,550
(Why is he so energetic today?)

1504
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:19,690
It's easy.

1505
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:22,065
Do you want to be hit by younger members?

1506
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,720
- Pardon? - Want to be hit by younger members?

1507
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:26,020
Call everyone including Cho Sae Ho and Nam Chang Hie.

1508
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:27,960
(Do you mean them?)

1509
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:29,800
- It's your first time. - I know.

1510
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,130
I'll start.

1511
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:32,660
(Dahyun earns 0 points.)

1512
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:35,745
Let's go, Se Chan. Say "start" beforehand.

1513
00:51:37,307 --> 00:51:40,040
That's right.

1514
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:41,140
Let's do it.

1515
00:51:41,144 --> 00:51:42,410
He's so cute.

1516
00:51:42,412 --> 00:51:44,095
Start.

1517
00:51:44,514 --> 00:51:49,565
(He turns his pelvis to throw the wig. What is his score?)

1518
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:52,320
It's 15.

1519
00:51:52,322 --> 00:51:54,090
That was close.

1520
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:55,320
- It's 15. - 15.

1521
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:58,290
(That was close.)

1522
00:51:58,295 --> 00:51:59,930
- It's closer to 15, right? - 15?

1523
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,960
- Is it 15? It is. - It's 15.

1524
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:03,260
- Isn't it closer to 15? - It's 15.

1525
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:05,300
- Wait a minute. - It's five.

1526
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:06,970
- It's 15. - It's 15.

1527
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,600
- It's definitely 5. - It's 15.

1528
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:10,600
It's 15.

1529
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,170
- Jae Seok definitely said... - It's 15.

1530
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:13,770
"That was close."

1531
00:52:13,777 --> 00:52:15,470
- He definitely said it was close. - It's 15.

1532
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:16,880
It's five.

1533
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,410
- It's 15. - No way.

1534
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:19,610
It's 15.

1535
00:52:19,616 --> 00:52:20,950
Isn't it?

1536
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:23,280
(Jae Seok moves it stealthily.)

1537
00:52:23,286 --> 00:52:25,820
- He said that it was close. - It's definitely five.

1538
00:52:25,822 --> 00:52:26,920
Can the judge decide?

1539
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:29,050
Jae Seok cheated.

1540
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:31,575
- No. - It'll be considered five points.

1541
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:34,160
Good job.

1542
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:37,075
- At least we earned five points. - This is good.

1543
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:40,600
Is it our turn?

1544
00:52:40,604 --> 00:52:42,445
Go, So Min.

1545
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:45,500
Split the hair in the middle.

1546
00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:47,040
The wig looks good on you.

1547
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:48,110
She has a middle split.

1548
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:50,010
You should do your hair like that every day.

1549
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,040
(How dare you say that?)

1550
00:52:51,047 --> 00:52:53,010
- It looks great on her. - Start.

1551
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:57,735
(She reduces the air resistance by splitting the hair.)

1552
00:52:57,821 --> 00:53:01,705
(Will So Min's strategy work?)

1553
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,760
(Stumbling)

1554
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,075
(This wasn't the plan.)

1555
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:07,530
(She loses her balance after tripping.)

1556
00:53:07,531 --> 00:53:09,590
(She steps on the starting line.)

1557
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,775
She stepped on the line.

1558
00:53:12,903 --> 00:53:15,470
(As she stepped on the line, she loses her chance.)

1559
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:16,740
She started.

1560
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,470
- She stepped on the line. - She stepped on it.

1561
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:19,600
- She's out. - No.

1562
00:53:19,609 --> 00:53:21,670
- She missed her chance. - She tripped,

1563
00:53:21,678 --> 00:53:24,010
- but is she out? - She hopped on one leg.

1564
00:53:24,014 --> 00:53:25,540
- Wasn't it very cute? - It was.

1565
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:28,110
(So Min earns 0 points.)

1566
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:30,450
Next is Team Suyuk.

1567
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:31,850
- Start. - You can do it.

1568
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:33,635
Sana.

1569
00:53:34,291 --> 00:53:36,190
We never know.

1570
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:38,520
- Sana has many hidden skills. - It'll be 20.

1571
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:43,105
(Sana has hidden skills. What is her score?)

1572
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:45,730
- It's negative 10. - Negative 10.

1573
00:53:45,735 --> 00:53:46,970
It's negative 10.

1574
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,570
(Her hidden skills...)

1575
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:51,615
(will remain hidden.)

1576
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:54,870
- She didn't say "start". - She didn't.

1577
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:56,210
- Sana. - She did.

1578
00:53:56,213 --> 00:53:57,240
No, she didn't.

1579
00:53:57,247 --> 00:53:58,610
She did right before she started.

1580
00:53:58,615 --> 00:54:00,610
- She didn't, or did you? - Did you say it or not?

1581
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:01,750
You didn't, did you?

1582
00:54:01,751 --> 00:54:03,480
I want to say that I didn't.

1583
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:05,380
(I want to say that I didn't.)

1584
00:54:05,388 --> 00:54:07,250
- Did you say it? - She wants to say that she didn't.

1585
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:08,950
She did say it.

1586
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:10,460
- It's okay. - Is it negative 10?

1587
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,860
You did well.

1588
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:13,630
I got negative 10 points.

1589
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,330
(Sana's honest score is negative 10 points.)

1590
00:54:15,332 --> 00:54:16,530
You look cute.

1591
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,600
(The members of TWICE show off their looks.)

1592
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:19,215
Start.

1593
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:20,870
(She easily scores 5 points.)

1594
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:22,500
At least it's not negative.

1595
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:23,600
(Nayeon from Team Ramyeon starts.)

1596
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:25,455
- Start. - Okay.

1597
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:29,910
(She gets sloppy and scores negative 10 points.)

1598
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:31,995
- Start. - Start.

1599
00:54:32,616 --> 00:54:33,980
Okay.

1600
00:54:33,984 --> 00:54:35,665
That's right.

1601
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:37,280
Start.

1602
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,950
(She throws it elegantly.)

1603
00:54:38,955 --> 00:54:40,950
It's 20 points.

1604
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:42,420
You got 20 points.

1605
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:43,920
Start.

1606
00:54:43,927 --> 00:54:44,920
Wait.

1607
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:46,060
Okay.

1608
00:54:46,062 --> 00:54:48,245
Good job, Momo.

1609
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:50,115
Start.

1610
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:51,800
- Throw it harder. - Harder.

1611
00:54:51,801 --> 00:54:53,200
It's 10 points.

1612
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:54,900
See? You did well.

1613
00:54:54,905 --> 00:54:56,545
Start.

1614
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:58,100
It's negative 10.

1615
00:54:58,108 --> 00:54:59,240
(Her bow scores negative 10 points.)

1616
00:54:59,242 --> 00:55:01,025
This is fun.

1617
00:55:01,177 --> 00:55:02,240
- Let's just... - That's good.

1618
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,610
leave it at that.

1619
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:05,140
The last turn goes to Team Suyuk.

1620
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:07,010
- Okay. - It's Jong Kook.

1621
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,210
Here he goes.

1622
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:10,620
- Is it Jong Kook? - Here he comes.

1623
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:12,250
He looks like a superhero.

1624
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:13,420
Start.

1625
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:14,620
(Team Suyuk's score depends on Jong Kook's head.)

1626
00:55:14,624 --> 00:55:15,920
That wig is difficult.

1627
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:16,990
- Are you starting? - Here I go.

1628
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:18,490
(He needs to score at least 15 points to win.)

1629
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,245
Start.

1630
00:55:20,497 --> 00:55:22,305
Okay.

1631
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:28,100
(Will Jong Kook earn over 15 points?)

1632
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,045
Okay, I got it.

1633
00:55:30,073 --> 00:55:32,270
(His wig falls between 15 and negative 10.)

1634
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:34,840
- That's sneaky. - What do you mean?

1635
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:37,210
(It's definitely 15 points.)

1636
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:39,680
- Come over here. - it's clearly 15 points.

1637
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,350
- There's 50 percent chance. - It's clearly 15.

1638
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:43,320
It's clearly 15 points.

1639
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,180
(Mr. Judge, it's 15 points.)

1640
00:55:46,189 --> 00:55:47,750
Isn't it 15 points?

1641
00:55:47,757 --> 00:55:49,220
It's 15 points.

1642
00:55:49,225 --> 00:55:51,435
(It's 15 points, Mr. Judge.)

1643
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:53,120
It's 15 points.

1644
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:55,630
- There's a big difference. - It's 15 points.

1645
00:55:55,632 --> 00:55:57,100
You should be objective.

1646
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:58,800
- It's clearly... - Please be objective.

1647
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:00,330
It's longer on this side.

1648
00:56:00,337 --> 00:56:02,245
Okay.

1649
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:03,570
Okay.

1650
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:06,870
(In my opinion, it's definitely 15 points.)

1651
00:56:06,876 --> 00:56:09,370
Look at this man.

1652
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:13,110
(I'll give you 150 points next time.)

1653
00:56:13,116 --> 00:56:14,880
It's Team Ramyeon's last turn.

1654
00:56:14,884 --> 00:56:16,310
(Jae Seok plays.)

1655
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,580
Win 50 points.

1656
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:19,080
Please win 50 points.

1657
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:21,005
This is...

1658
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,360
(He warms up to get the winner's hint.)

1659
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,035
- You can do it. - Show us, Jae Seok.

1660
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:28,190
(I'll show you.)

1661
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:29,260
That's right.

1662
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:30,600
He's really good.

1663
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,730
He's enjoying it.

1664
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:33,230
- Jae Seok is enjoying it. - What is he doing?

1665
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:35,770
- What is he doing? - What's wrong with him?

1666
00:56:35,772 --> 00:56:37,970
Why is he so annoying today?

1667
00:56:37,974 --> 00:56:40,270
What's wrong with you today? What did you eat yesterday?

1668
00:56:40,276 --> 00:56:42,810
He's the ugliest today. How does he look like that?

1669
00:56:42,812 --> 00:56:45,080
Did he eat a lot of sweets today?

1670
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:47,325
(Enjoy life.)

1671
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,550
(No more fooling around.)

1672
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:51,720
(Team Ramyeon's last try!)

1673
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:54,290
- Start! - Good. Let's focus.

1674
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,020
(He was getting the feel of it when he was fooling around.)

1675
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:58,890
If you can reach 50, that's great.

1676
00:56:58,895 --> 00:57:00,530
Good. Go!

1677
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,915
(Can Jae Seok create miracle?)

1678
00:57:03,933 --> 00:57:05,575
Good job!

1679
00:57:05,702 --> 00:57:08,645
(Between negative 20 and 15?)

1680
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:10,600
- 15! - Wait!

1681
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,170
- Don't touch it. - Don't touch it.

1682
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,940
- 15. - This has to be 15.

1683
00:57:13,943 --> 00:57:15,710
Isn't it 15?

1684
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:17,110
- Don't touch it. - It's 15.

1685
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,410
- This is 15. - Take a look at this.

1686
00:57:18,415 --> 00:57:19,840
- This is 15. - It's 15.

1687
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,280
- This is so 15. - Don't touch it.

1688
00:57:21,284 --> 00:57:24,420
- Don't touch it! - It's so 15.

1689
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:26,120
This doesn't make any sense.

1690
00:57:26,122 --> 00:57:27,620
- Don't touch it. - Don't touch it.

1691
00:57:27,624 --> 00:57:29,320
- I know. It doesn't make sense. - Look at it this way.

1692
00:57:29,325 --> 00:57:30,690
This doesn't make sense.

1693
00:57:30,694 --> 00:57:31,690
(Sweating)

1694
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,660
What? It's there. Look at this.

1695
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:38,000
(He accepts it as 15!)

1696
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:40,100
This guy. I almost took you the wrong way.

1697
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:41,330
(He apologizes for earlier.)

1698
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:43,640
He's not mad anymore.

1699
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,255
- All right! - All right!

1700
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:47,125
Good.

1701
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:48,840
Get ready.

1702
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:50,680
(Team Rice's last try)

1703
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:51,910
What's that?

1704
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:54,850
Who is this?

1705
00:57:54,851 --> 00:57:57,035
It looks like Haha's hair.

1706
00:57:58,021 --> 00:57:59,835
(Throwing)

1707
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:00,850
Good luck.

1708
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:05,075
(The short Native Indian is showy.)

1709
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,605
It looks great on him.

1710
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,700
- You're so handsome. - It's totally your hair.

1711
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:14,630
There has to be somebody who looks like this.

1712
00:58:14,637 --> 00:58:16,300
You look like your mother when she was a young woman.

1713
00:58:16,306 --> 00:58:18,000
(That's right.)

1714
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:19,540
(She had long straight hair, and her heart fluttered with joy.)

1715
00:58:19,542 --> 00:58:20,710
You look like your mother when she was a young woman.

1716
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:24,210
That's right. When her heart fluttered with joy.

1717
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:25,310
That's who you are.

1718
00:58:25,315 --> 00:58:27,750
(He's identical to his mother.)

1719
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:28,750
- Start. - Start!

1720
00:58:28,752 --> 00:58:32,295
(This is penniless Team Rice's final try!)

1721
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:34,865
(He flew.)

1722
00:58:35,125 --> 00:58:38,320
(He threw himself in the air. What is the result?)

1723
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:39,320
Disqualified!

1724
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:40,690
(It's outside the lines, so it's disqualified.)

1725
00:58:40,697 --> 00:58:41,760
Disqualified.

1726
00:58:41,765 --> 00:58:44,630
(He flounders in the air and gets disqualified.)

1727
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:47,985
Wait, what did I do? What's wrong?

1728
00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:49,930
Last person.

1729
00:58:49,939 --> 00:58:51,915
(Team Sweet Potato's last try)

1730
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:55,210
(Is it finally my turn?)

1731
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:57,310
Kwang Soo, walk back to the shade.

1732
00:58:57,313 --> 00:58:58,640
I watched earlier, and it was good.

1733
00:58:58,648 --> 00:59:01,225
I think he'll get tired while he runs up.

1734
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:06,235
(I realized when I was practicing!)

1735
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:11,120
(If you run up from a distance, it travels farther!)

1736
00:59:11,127 --> 00:59:14,760
(Do as you practiced!)

1737
00:59:14,764 --> 00:59:16,430
More. Go farther.

1738
00:59:16,432 --> 00:59:18,000
(He stands farther away than when he practiced.)

1739
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:19,660
- Run up to it. Use your speed. - Good luck.

1740
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:20,700
Good luck.

1741
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,985
(Use your speed!)

1742
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:25,415
Start!

1743
00:59:26,075 --> 00:59:29,185
(Booing)

1744
00:59:29,412 --> 00:59:32,080
(People boo at him at a crucial moment.)

1745
00:59:32,081 --> 00:59:33,180
You're ugly.

1746
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:34,750
(Booing)

1747
00:59:34,751 --> 00:59:35,950
It's no joke.

1748
00:59:35,952 --> 00:59:37,935
(I have to overcome this.)

1749
00:59:39,055 --> 00:59:40,050
It looks like your real hair.

1750
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:41,390
(Team Sweet Potato's last person to go is Kwang Soo!)

1751
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:45,275
(He swung his head powerfully!)

1752
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:46,990
It looks like your real hair.

1753
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:48,330
(Team Sweet Potato's last person to go is Kwang Soo!)

1754
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:52,100
(He swung his head powerfully!)

1755
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:54,200
(The momentum was in his favor!)

1756
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:57,200
(Can he get a high score?)

1757
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:58,900
- Okay. - It's...

1758
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:01,985
(What?)

1759
01:00:02,345 --> 01:00:04,510
(What did I run up for?)

1760
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,855
- Negative five. - All right!

1761
01:00:07,217 --> 01:00:09,410
- This is ridiculous. - That was useless.

1762
01:00:09,419 --> 01:00:11,195
(The finale is anticlimactic.)

1763
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:15,020
(He wastes his energy on running and scores negative 5 points.)

1764
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:18,635
(Final Cabbage Leaves Count)

1765
01:00:18,795 --> 01:00:22,505
(It's time to purchase the 2nd hint. Which hint will they look at?)

1766
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:25,200
- It's kind of... - Behind you, Kwang Soo.

1767
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:27,470
(Team Sweet Potato buys number 1 hint from the teenagers.)

1768
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,085
What is it?

1769
01:00:29,372 --> 01:00:31,200
(Ramyeon is in 1st place!)

1770
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:33,300
- See? - Hide it.

1771
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:35,525
(It's ramyeon for sure.)

1772
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:39,210
(Team Ramyeon buys number 2 hint from the 20s.)

1773
01:00:39,215 --> 01:00:41,410
- This is possible. - See? I told you.

1774
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:43,210
- This is unexpected. - I knew it.

1775
01:00:43,219 --> 01:00:44,720
That was unexpected.

1776
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,720
- I knew it. - You can't deny it.

1777
01:00:46,723 --> 01:00:49,965
- I knew it. - That was unexpected.

1778
01:00:50,093 --> 01:00:52,190
Should we buy a hint from the 40s or 50s?

1779
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:53,520
40s?

1780
01:00:53,529 --> 01:00:55,690
Okay. We should go for the middle.

1781
01:00:55,698 --> 01:00:59,715
(What food does people in their 40s think goes well with kimchi?)

1782
01:01:00,603 --> 01:01:03,000
(Rice is in 1st place!)

1783
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:04,655
People in their 40s.

1784
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:08,210
- That was totally unexpected. - Goodness.

1785
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:10,955
That was so unexpected.

1786
01:01:11,047 --> 01:01:12,510
There's a twist.

1787
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,195
I know.

1788
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:18,280
This is the final mission...

1789
01:01:18,288 --> 01:01:20,180
where you can protect or steal first place.

1790
01:01:20,189 --> 01:01:23,320
Here are the rules for Finding Kimchi's Partner.

1791
01:01:23,326 --> 01:01:24,990
- Okay. - Okay.

1792
01:01:24,994 --> 01:01:28,960
If you think the dish on your team's menu is not in first place,

1793
01:01:28,965 --> 01:01:32,900
you can rip the name tags of people in first place and switch.

1794
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:36,700
(If you rip the name tags of 1st place team, you can switch.)

1795
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:39,055
Suyuk? Ramyeon?

1796
01:01:39,108 --> 01:01:41,325
They won't try to rip our name tags.

1797
01:01:41,911 --> 01:01:44,180
- What? - We're done.

1798
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,810
- We're done. - There's an exception.

1799
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:47,510
There's an exception.

1800
01:01:47,517 --> 01:01:50,920
Each team will get stickers...

1801
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:53,580
containing the dish and Bomb Stickers.

1802
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:56,390
If you rip the name tag of a person with the Menu Sticker,

1803
01:01:56,392 --> 01:01:57,920
you can switch the dish,

1804
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,360
but if you rip the name tag of someone with the Bomb Sticker,

1805
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:01,830
the team that ripped the name tag is eliminated.

1806
01:02:01,831 --> 01:02:03,360
- That's mean. - The entire team?

1807
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:05,900
If you rip the name tag of someone with no sticker,

1808
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,600
then only the person who ripped the name tag is eliminated.

1809
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:10,570
I remember Tzuyu got eliminated last time because of a mistake.

1810
01:02:10,573 --> 01:02:13,515
She was eliminated early last time.

1811
01:02:13,543 --> 01:02:16,610
(Everybody knew Jae Seok was a trap.)

1812
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:17,980
(Tzuyu was unstoppable.)

1813
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:21,325
(She finished the game in 5 minutes.)

1814
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,850
We only have to look out for Tzuyu.

1815
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:28,350
However, if you think your dish is the first place menu,

1816
01:02:28,358 --> 01:02:31,190
you can find the platforms hidden in this building...

1817
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:33,960
and say your answer to win the race.

1818
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:34,990
(If you say your answer on the platform, you win the race!)

1819
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:36,430
Is that it?

1820
01:02:36,432 --> 01:02:39,260
The platform. It must be somewhere.

1821
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:40,900
- Do we have to find it? - Yes.

1822
01:02:40,903 --> 01:02:43,900
If it's the right answer, your team wins the race.

1823
01:02:43,906 --> 01:02:47,210
If it's the wrong answer, the entire team is eliminated.

1824
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,710
- The entire team? - Yes.

1825
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:50,480
We have to be careful.

1826
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,410
The best hints...

1827
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:55,480
are hidden in this building.

1828
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,420
These are the different types of hints.

1829
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,450
First, there's a hint about the first place dish.

1830
01:02:59,455 --> 01:03:01,950
Second, there's a hint about the location of the platform.

1831
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,550
- Okay. - There's one each.

1832
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:07,260
Plus, there's a hint about each team's Bomb Sticker.

1833
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,430
(There are 3 hints.)

1834
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:10,060
There are many hints.

1835
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:12,330
Each team will head to their headquarters.

1836
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:14,000
- Come on. - Leader!

1837
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:16,100
- Let's go. - We're in trouble.

1838
01:03:16,105 --> 01:03:17,640
I think ramyeon is in first place.

1839
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,100
- I agree. - So we...

1840
01:03:19,108 --> 01:03:20,100
We have to protect it.

1841
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:23,370
I'm a little confused because I think it can be suyuk.

1842
01:03:23,379 --> 01:03:25,740
- Suyuk? - I think it might be better.

1843
01:03:25,748 --> 01:03:26,740
(They saw a hint on suyuk and start thinking.)

1844
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:28,510
Is suyuk better?

1845
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:30,920
When you first make kimchi, you eat it with suyuk.

1846
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,950
- I agree. - It's never ramyeon.

1847
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:35,390
Rice is all right.

1848
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:38,390
- It has to be suyuk. - Then we have to keep that in mind.

1849
01:03:38,394 --> 01:03:41,630
If it's not ramyeon, we have to switch with the team that has suyuk.

1850
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,090
With Jong Kook's team.

1851
01:03:43,099 --> 01:03:45,060
I don't know how this will turn out.

1852
01:03:45,068 --> 01:03:46,775
Do we have to let them rip our name tags?

1853
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:51,200
We heard what Team Ramyeon was thinking.

1854
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:54,570
They think suyuk is in two 1st-place hints.

1855
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,740
- That's what they were saying. - Really?

1856
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:57,810
- That's what Nayeon was saying too. - Right?

1857
01:03:57,814 --> 01:04:00,510
"People in their 30s and 40s would choose suyuk."

1858
01:04:00,516 --> 01:04:02,410
They said this among themselves.

1859
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:05,020
What if it's really suyuk?

1860
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:07,890
I don't think so because we saw two hints,

1861
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,890
and people in their 30s chose ramyeon.

1862
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:13,875
People in their 40s chose rice.

1863
01:04:14,697 --> 01:04:16,690
Rice was so unexpected.

1864
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:19,500
That surprised me too.

1865
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:23,070
They thought rice goes well with kimchi.

1866
01:04:23,072 --> 01:04:24,370
What do we do?

1867
01:04:24,373 --> 01:04:26,015
(Rice might be the 1st place.)

1868
01:04:26,142 --> 01:04:28,670
I'm certain people in their teens and 20s chose ramyeon.

1869
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:31,180
I overheard, and I think people in their 50s chose ramyeon too.

1870
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,180
- Is that right? - Yes.

1871
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:33,810
Ramyeon has the highest probability then.

1872
01:04:33,816 --> 01:04:36,850
It is. Their team is in danger.

1873
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,220
We're at an advantage. Nobody is interested in us.

1874
01:04:38,221 --> 01:04:40,180
- That's right. - I agree.

1875
01:04:40,189 --> 01:04:42,590
It's kind of sad though.

1876
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:45,890
Even if people see us, they won't be on full alert.

1877
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:48,960
We just have to search for hints like crazy.

1878
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:49,960
Hints.

1879
01:04:49,966 --> 01:04:54,385
I'm certain about one thing only. It's not sweet potato.

1880
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,200
I'm certain.

1881
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:58,600
It's neither sweet potato nor rice.

1882
01:04:58,608 --> 01:05:00,740
- I think it's ramyeon too. - That's what everybody thinks.

1883
01:05:00,743 --> 01:05:02,370
Let's go for ramyeon first.

1884
01:05:02,378 --> 01:05:04,280
- We have to look for more hints. - Okay.

1885
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,440
How do we distribute these?

1886
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:10,110
People will think a male member has the Menu Sticker.

1887
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:11,850
In order to protect it.

1888
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:13,380
Who should take the Menu Sticker?

1889
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,590
Somebody who will survive until the end.

1890
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:17,050
That's you.

1891
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:20,090
But I might get eliminated first too.

1892
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,030
Right, people might go after you.

1893
01:05:22,031 --> 01:05:23,660
- What about the Bomb Sticker? - The Bomb Sticker...

1894
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,300
should go to somebody who'll get eliminated easily...

1895
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,360
(It should be somebody who's a good target for other teams.)

1896
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:27,670
Or somebody who'll attack others well.

1897
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:30,230
You can attack as much as you want.

1898
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:33,270
I have to take the Bomb Sticker and eliminate others like crazy.

1899
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,670
Let's give you the Bomb Sticker for now.

1900
01:05:34,677 --> 01:05:36,370
Give it to him, Jihyo.

1901
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:38,380
Then I'll lead them...

1902
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:40,255
into ripping my name tag.

1903
01:05:40,349 --> 01:05:42,625
I have to be a good actor.

1904
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:44,150
This is difficult.

1905
01:05:44,153 --> 01:05:45,920
You should all pretend like you have the Bomb Sticker.

1906
01:05:45,922 --> 01:05:47,590
The person who has the Menu Sticker...

1907
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,205
should still act like they have the Bomb Sticker.

1908
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:52,735
(She understands.)

1909
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:55,090
Okay, you take the Bomb Sticker, and you take the Menu Sticker.

1910
01:05:55,097 --> 01:05:56,290
(The teams decide on who takes the stickers.)

1911
01:05:56,299 --> 01:05:57,430
This is for the best.

1912
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,530
- Let's do this. - Let's go.

1913
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:01,830
- Go. - Let's go, ramyeon!

1914
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:04,040
- Let's go, sweet potato! - Let's go, sweet potato!

1915
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,900
Race starts in five seconds.

1916
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:08,070
- Are we starting all of a sudden? - Five,

1917
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:09,510
- I'm scared. - four,

1918
01:06:09,512 --> 01:06:11,640
- I want to do well. - three,

1919
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:12,910
two,

1920
01:06:12,915 --> 01:06:13,980
one.

1921
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:15,580
- I'm going this way. - Race starts.

1922
01:06:15,585 --> 01:06:17,380
- Okay. - Good luck.

1923
01:06:17,386 --> 01:06:19,095
Let's go this way.

1924
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:21,220
That space?

1925
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:22,490
Is that what we're doing?

1926
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:25,520
- I just want to say "ramyeon" now. - Ramyeon!

1927
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:27,230
Ramyeon...

1928
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:28,790
We have to get ramyeon.

1929
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,130
I think it's ramyeon.

1930
01:06:30,132 --> 01:06:33,500
Everybody is after us.

1931
01:06:33,502 --> 01:06:35,770
I agree as well.

1932
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:38,200
Right? You think so too, right?

1933
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,670
We have to find the hints.

1934
01:06:39,675 --> 01:06:40,740
(Team Ramyeon has to find a hint on suyuk and be on full alert.)

1935
01:06:40,743 --> 01:06:42,640
Shouldn't we find some hints?

1936
01:06:42,645 --> 01:06:43,840
(Team Ramyeon has to find a hint on suyuk and be on full alert.)

1937
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:46,240
I don't think we should rip name tags from the beginning.

1938
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:48,125
We have to see the hints...

1939
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:50,665
about the Bomb Stickers.

1940
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,280
- Will there be... - There's one.

1941
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:54,890
(There's a hint!)

1942
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,020
Where?

1943
01:06:56,025 --> 01:06:57,960
- See? I told you. - This.

1944
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,220
You're the best.

1945
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:01,490
- Here. - There you go.

1946
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,590
Suyuk is in 4th place for people in 50s.

1947
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,930
- Fourth place? - See? I knew it.

1948
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:07,885
It's certainly not suyuk.

1949
01:07:08,004 --> 01:07:09,870
- A box? - A box...

1950
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:10,970
It's in...

1951
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:12,500
So Min is looking actively.

1952
01:07:12,508 --> 01:07:15,885
(You have to find as many hints as possible!)

1953
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:17,840
(She finds a hint!)

1954
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,495
This is awesome.

1955
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:21,050
- Tzuyu... - This is awesome.

1956
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:22,750
(Tzuyu does a good job unlike last time!)

1957
01:07:22,752 --> 01:07:25,350
"Sweet potato is in fourth place for people in 30s."

1958
01:07:25,354 --> 01:07:27,420
- This is not it. - It's not.

1959
01:07:27,423 --> 01:07:29,120
What? Is this all?

1960
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:30,420
Let's hurry.

1961
01:07:30,426 --> 01:07:31,760
What? That wasn't helpful.

1962
01:07:31,761 --> 01:07:34,460
- I knew that much. - I know.

1963
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:36,205
That was awful.

1964
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,160
Sweet potato...

1965
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:40,415
Nobody is after us.

1966
01:07:40,636 --> 01:07:42,470
I feel relaxed.

1967
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:44,340
It can't be sweet potato.

1968
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:45,770
The five of us are a family.

1969
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:47,000
It's gray.

1970
01:07:47,009 --> 01:07:48,310
- What are they doing there? - Suyuk.

1971
01:07:48,311 --> 01:07:49,840
Let's go towards them.

1972
01:07:49,845 --> 01:07:51,010
It's Team Suyuk.

1973
01:07:51,013 --> 01:07:52,140
(They walk confidently.)

1974
01:07:52,148 --> 01:07:53,995
It's Team Suyuk!

1975
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:55,480
It's Team Suyuk!

1976
01:07:55,484 --> 01:07:57,250
Is that Team Sweet Potato?

1977
01:07:57,253 --> 01:07:59,650
- Let's go that way. - It's Team Suyuk!

1978
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:00,790
Girls, we will...

1979
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,250
- Jong Kook. - Where are you going?

1980
01:08:02,258 --> 01:08:04,260
Why are they running away?

1981
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,590
Why are they following us?

1982
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:06,920
Why do they keep coming?

1983
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:08,060
(Team Sweet Potato is the outlaw of this territory.)

1984
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:09,805
This is driving me nuts.

1985
01:08:10,433 --> 01:08:12,860
Jong Kook, so many people are after suyuk.

1986
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:14,100
- Suyuk? - Yes.

1987
01:08:14,103 --> 01:08:15,845
Why are you hiding?

1988
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:17,340
- Sana. - Yes?

1989
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,000
Are you worried about your backside?

1990
01:08:19,008 --> 01:08:21,325
- You must be hiding something. - Stop looking.

1991
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:23,825
Is it Jong Kook and Ji Hyo?

1992
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,810
We can't start ripping name tags yet.

1993
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:27,680
- I know. - I know we can't.

1994
01:08:27,683 --> 01:08:28,910
We can't rip name tags yet.

1995
01:08:28,918 --> 01:08:32,050
It's not time yet. We have to find the hints and be certain.

1996
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:33,150
(Team Suyuk leaves to find hints.)

1997
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:34,650
- Let's go downstairs. - Should we?

1998
01:08:34,657 --> 01:08:37,290
- Downstairs? - We don't have the main item,

1999
01:08:37,293 --> 01:08:38,760
so we're going around too comfortably.

2000
01:08:38,761 --> 01:08:40,520
(They have nothing to lose, so they're relaxed.)

2001
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:41,760
- Do we go this way? - Hold on.

2002
01:08:41,764 --> 01:08:43,090
Usually...

2003
01:08:43,099 --> 01:08:44,200
(Team Suyuk goes downstairs to avoid Team Sweet Potato.)

2004
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,130
Usually, you can find some around here.

2005
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,230
(They need a hint about Team Rice.)

2006
01:08:48,237 --> 01:08:50,045
There are no hints.

2007
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:53,000
(Where are the hints?)

2008
01:08:53,008 --> 01:08:54,210
I found one.

2009
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,070
(He finds their second hint.)

2010
01:08:57,079 --> 01:08:59,355
(He looks around.)

2011
01:08:59,382 --> 01:09:02,580
(He opens up the hint carefully.)

2012
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:03,610
Then...

2013
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,880
If ramyeon is in 2nd place, 1st place is something else.

2014
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:07,620
(Ramyeon, 2nd place for 50s)

2015
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,150
(Suyuk, 4th place for 50s)

2016
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:10,760
(Team Suyuk's Hints)

2017
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,990
Then it's either sweet potato or rice.

2018
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:14,590
- I think it's rice. - Then...

2019
01:09:14,597 --> 01:09:16,605
we think...

2020
01:09:16,699 --> 01:09:19,475
- rice is more likely. - I think it's rice.

2021
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:20,630
Rice...

2022
01:09:20,636 --> 01:09:22,900
(There's a higher probability that rice is 1st place!)

2023
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:24,700
We have to find one first...

2024
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,840
to know what it looks like.

2025
01:09:26,842 --> 01:09:29,140
(They meet with Team Ramyeon.)

2026
01:09:29,145 --> 01:09:30,610
Okay, Team Sweet Potato!

2027
01:09:30,613 --> 01:09:33,010
(They don't know who has the Bomb Sticker.)

2028
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:34,810
Don't you have the Bomb Sticker?

2029
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:36,580
Okay, Nayeon.

2030
01:09:36,585 --> 01:09:38,995
(They all act as if they have the Bomb Sticker.)

2031
01:09:40,122 --> 01:09:41,350
Gosh, this...

2032
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:43,350
Rip it. Go ahead.

2033
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:44,820
Gosh, this...

2034
01:09:44,827 --> 01:09:46,060
(You can rip it if you want.)

2035
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,530
You know Team Ramyeon is...

2036
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:49,190
everybody's enemy, right?

2037
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:51,100
We hope we are everybody's enemy.

2038
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,400
- Really? - Yes.

2039
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,830
You don't think it's ramyeon?

2040
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,700
You know we saw the last one too, right?

2041
01:09:55,704 --> 01:09:56,830
We have something else in mind.

2042
01:09:56,839 --> 01:09:58,600
There's a twist.

2043
01:09:58,607 --> 01:09:59,800
You don't think it's sweet potato, right?

2044
01:09:59,809 --> 01:10:00,940
No, we don't.

2045
01:10:00,943 --> 01:10:04,625
(Don't worry! It's not sweet potato.)

2046
01:10:05,314 --> 01:10:08,150
Sweet potato has nothing to do with our target.

2047
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:10,610
It might be a waste of time to be after us only.

2048
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:11,850
You should look for some hints first.

2049
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:13,220
We need to look for some hints.

2050
01:10:13,222 --> 01:10:14,850
Okay, see you later then.

2051
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,420
(They don't have hints about each other,)

2052
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,375
(so they part ways.)

2053
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:19,820
(They feel each other out and leave.)

2054
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,360
- Why are you laughing? - What? That looked sassy.

2055
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:23,830
Se Chan's name tag is crooked.

2056
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,700
- Right? Se Chan's name tag was. - It was obviously crooked.

2057
01:10:26,702 --> 01:10:29,570
(Se Chan's name tag is crooked?)

2058
01:10:29,572 --> 01:10:30,730
Hold on.

2059
01:10:30,739 --> 01:10:32,800
(Kwang Soo was looking carefully at Se Chan's name tag.)

2060
01:10:32,808 --> 01:10:36,410
(He saw that Se Chan's name tag was too obviously crooked.)

2061
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:37,910
That scared me.

2062
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:39,110
Kwang Soo...

2063
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:41,595
He's so detailed.

2064
01:10:41,884 --> 01:10:43,350
(Se Chan has a sticker. Is it Bomb or Menu Sticker?)

2065
01:10:43,352 --> 01:10:44,820
I put it on a bit crooked.

2066
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,595
(Se Chan has a sticker. Is it Bomb or Menu Sticker?)

2067
01:10:46,655 --> 01:10:48,220
This is brutal.

2068
01:10:48,224 --> 01:10:49,220
(Team Rice is looking for hints as planned.)

2069
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:50,750
They're coming.

2070
01:10:50,759 --> 01:10:52,220
Is it Team Rice?

2071
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:53,620
- Team Rice. - Is it Team Rice?

2072
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,730
They're not very popular either.

2073
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:56,930
It's Team Rice.

2074
01:10:56,932 --> 01:10:59,430
We're Team Rice,

2075
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:00,700
- so you're not interested in us. - We're Team Rice.

2076
01:11:00,703 --> 01:11:03,300
- We have no reason to attack you. - Who are you after?

2077
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:04,500
We're after Team Ramyeon.

2078
01:11:04,507 --> 01:11:05,740
- Same here. - You too?

2079
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:08,410
Should we mix...

2080
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,510
half of Team Sweet Potato and Team Rice?

2081
01:11:10,513 --> 01:11:12,710
- Should we? - Should we mix them?

2082
01:11:12,715 --> 01:11:14,350
That's fine.

2083
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,250
Have you had rice with sweet potato?

2084
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:17,380
- That's right. - I have.

2085
01:11:17,386 --> 01:11:18,550
It's so good.

2086
01:11:18,554 --> 01:11:20,520
You add rice and sweet potato...

2087
01:11:20,523 --> 01:11:21,590
- in the rice cooker. - Right.

2088
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:23,450
It goes well with kimchi.

2089
01:11:23,459 --> 01:11:24,990
Should we try it out for 20 minutes?

2090
01:11:24,994 --> 01:11:26,290
- Good. - Should we?

2091
01:11:26,295 --> 01:11:28,360
- We can share the hints too. - Of course.

2092
01:11:28,364 --> 01:11:30,390
When we get back again...

2093
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:32,960
and if somebody is gone, I'll feel really bad about it.

2094
01:11:32,968 --> 01:11:34,630
- Let's not do that. - Let's promise each other.

2095
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:35,770
Why would we do that to each other?

2096
01:11:35,771 --> 01:11:36,830
We have no reasons to rip each other's name tag.

2097
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,140
That's true.

2098
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,540
We'll both die if we keep doing this.

2099
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:42,070
This is a new type of collaboration.

2100
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:43,340
I agree.

2101
01:11:43,345 --> 01:11:45,010
A collaboration like this...

2102
01:11:45,014 --> 01:11:46,440
It's a fantastic collaboration.

2103
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,110
Sweet potato and rice.

2104
01:11:48,117 --> 01:11:49,310
(This is the 2019 spring and summer kimchi trend.)

2105
01:11:49,318 --> 01:11:51,680
We should go that way together.

2106
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:52,780
Should we go?

2107
01:11:52,788 --> 01:11:54,350
This is a fun collaboration.

2108
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:55,450
(They'll meet back in 20 minutes because they trust each other.)

2109
01:11:55,457 --> 01:11:58,120
Let's keep looking for 20 minutes.

2110
01:11:58,127 --> 01:12:00,660
We have to find who has the Bomb Sticker.

2111
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:03,730
We don't know which teams will become Team Ramyeon or Suyuk,

2112
01:12:03,732 --> 01:12:06,575
so we have to remove them first.

2113
01:12:06,635 --> 01:12:09,545
(Peeking)

2114
01:12:09,672 --> 01:12:10,800
Should we go upstairs?

2115
01:12:10,806 --> 01:12:12,270
(His betrayal instinct is coming to life.)

2116
01:12:12,274 --> 01:12:13,540
He was going to rip my name tag.

2117
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,210
He was trying to rip mine.

2118
01:12:15,210 --> 01:12:16,370
Should I tell on you to Haha?

2119
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:18,040
- Kwang Soo. - No, I won't rip yours.

2120
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:19,855
- You were trying to rip mine. - I wasn't.

2121
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:22,350
Gosh...

2122
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:24,450
See?

2123
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:25,550
- Tzuyu, - What are you talking about?

2124
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:27,550
- he's trying to rip mine. - I'm not.

2125
01:12:27,556 --> 01:12:28,820
Tzuyu.

2126
01:12:28,824 --> 01:12:30,290
I have to call Haha.

2127
01:12:30,292 --> 01:12:31,960
(I am Team Sweet Potato, so I have nothing to lose.)

2128
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:33,190
(If So Min has the Menu Sticker, that's great.)

2129
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:34,430
Why?

2130
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:35,890
Why? Don't do this.

2131
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,460
I just need one hint.

2132
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:38,630
Let's look for more hints.

2133
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:39,900
You never know.

2134
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:41,000
(It's fine as long as she doesn't have the Bomb Sticker.)

2135
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,745
I don't have anything.

2136
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:44,585
Rip it.

2137
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:46,070
Okay.

2138
01:12:46,075 --> 01:12:47,300
- Rip it. - All right.

2139
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:48,340
Go ahead.

2140
01:12:48,344 --> 01:12:49,410
Rip...

2141
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:50,610
- Rip mine. - What?

2142
01:12:50,613 --> 01:12:52,010
- Okay. - Rip it.

2143
01:12:52,014 --> 01:12:53,995
(Will he really rip it?)

2144
01:12:55,017 --> 01:12:56,080
- Rip it. - This is driving me nuts.

2145
01:12:56,085 --> 01:12:58,350
(He hesitates.)

2146
01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:00,680
(I don't think Kwang Soo has the Bomb Sticker.)

2147
01:13:00,689 --> 01:13:01,790
Let's look for some hints.

2148
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:03,290
(Should I just rip his?)

2149
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:04,490
You can rip mine.

2150
01:13:04,493 --> 01:13:06,490
- Really? - Yes.

2151
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:08,230
Really?

2152
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:09,890
I'm going to rip it.

2153
01:13:09,898 --> 01:13:11,330
- Should I? - Hold on.

2154
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:12,430
Let's look for more hints...

2155
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:13,600
(She ripped it!)

2156
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:18,100
(Bomb)

2157
01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:19,370
No way!

2158
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:21,425
(Kwang Soo had the Bomb Sticker!)

2159
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:24,725
(No way!)

2160
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,610
What do I do?

2161
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:29,825
(She didn't know he had it.)

2162
01:13:30,085 --> 01:13:34,450
(They gave the Bomb Sticker to the person who attacks well.)

2163
01:13:34,456 --> 01:13:38,205
(Kwang Soo had Team Sweet Potato's Bomb Sticker.)

2164
01:13:40,996 --> 01:13:42,430
- So Min. - I'm so mad.

2165
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:43,490
(She should have realized when he was teasing her.)

2166
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:45,100
What do I do?

2167
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:46,860
That came out of nowhere.

2168
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:48,770
That was insane. There are no hints.

2169
01:13:48,771 --> 01:13:50,900
I didn't know you had the Bomb Sticker.

2170
01:13:50,906 --> 01:13:52,670
You didn't know,

2171
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:54,170
and you just ripped my name tag?

2172
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:56,085
It serves you right.

2173
01:13:56,211 --> 01:13:57,610
What now?

2174
01:13:57,613 --> 01:13:59,540
You stole our cabbage leaves, so it serves you right.

2175
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:03,310
(Team Rice is eliminated. Team Sweet Potato takes their menu.)

2176
01:14:03,318 --> 01:14:04,680
Let's look for hints.

2177
01:14:04,687 --> 01:14:05,950
(The other half of the team doesn't know this.)

2178
01:14:05,954 --> 01:14:07,850
It'll be really funny if we meet back later...

2179
01:14:07,856 --> 01:14:10,065
and are missing one person each.

2180
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:14,320
We might all get eliminated while walking down the hall like this.

2181
01:14:14,329 --> 01:14:15,890
Team Rice is eliminated.

2182
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:16,930
- What? - What?

2183
01:14:16,932 --> 01:14:18,160
(Team Rice is eliminated.)

2184
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:19,160
- What? - What?

2185
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,215
- Really? - Why?

2186
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,870
- Goodness. - All of a sudden?

2187
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:24,670
- All of a sudden? Why? - Why?

2188
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:25,770
Wait...

2189
01:14:25,774 --> 01:14:26,770
What?

2190
01:14:26,775 --> 01:14:28,210
It's ramyeon.

2191
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,740
It's ramyeon for sure.

2192
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:30,870
Let's go.

2193
01:14:30,879 --> 01:14:31,940
- No, no. - No, no.

2194
01:14:31,947 --> 01:14:33,910
No, no. They got absorbed. Somebody eliminated them.

2195
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:34,980
Somebody eliminated them.

2196
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:37,080
Is it Team Ramyeon? Will you tell us who it was?

2197
01:14:37,086 --> 01:14:38,150
(Who took Team Rice that we were after?)

2198
01:14:38,153 --> 01:14:39,350
Won't you tell us?

2199
01:14:39,354 --> 01:14:40,720
- Really? - Why?

2200
01:14:40,723 --> 01:14:42,050
Somebody got the Bomb.

2201
01:14:42,057 --> 01:14:44,090
- Somebody ripped it. - Is it Tzuyu?

2202
01:14:44,093 --> 01:14:45,860
Was it Tzuyu?

2203
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,120
Somebody got the Bomb.

2204
01:14:47,129 --> 01:14:48,560
Goodness.

2205
01:14:48,564 --> 01:14:50,090
(They were just getting started.)

2206
01:14:50,099 --> 01:14:51,200
Please go to jail.

2207
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,775
(There's no mercy. They have to go to jail.)

2208
01:14:54,436 --> 01:14:57,200
- Really? - Tzuyu.

2209
01:14:57,206 --> 01:14:58,370
Tzuyu...

2210
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:00,600
Sorry for not keeping our promise. We were supposed to meet again.

2211
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:01,940
I know. What now?

2212
01:15:01,944 --> 01:15:03,585
(The collaboration is forced to dissolve in 10 minutes.)

2213
01:15:04,613 --> 01:15:06,510
- There are not enough hints. - I know.

2214
01:15:06,515 --> 01:15:09,225
I thought they said there are many hints.

2215
01:15:09,585 --> 01:15:13,720
(Where are the hints?)

2216
01:15:13,722 --> 01:15:14,950
I found one.

2217
01:15:14,957 --> 01:15:17,865
(She finally found one!)

2218
01:15:18,427 --> 01:15:21,160
(What is the hint about?)

2219
01:15:21,163 --> 01:15:23,605
- Momo. - Momo.

2220
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,160
- This is incredible. - This is incredible.

2221
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:27,200
What is it?

2222
01:15:27,202 --> 01:15:30,330
(Suyuk, 4th place for people in their 50s)

2223
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:33,670
I think it will be either ramyeon or suyuk.

2224
01:15:33,675 --> 01:15:36,785
- Suyuk. - Suyuk could be more popular.

2225
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,110
(They didn't think suyuk would rank so low.)

2226
01:15:41,116 --> 01:15:43,210
That means it's ramyeon.

2227
01:15:43,218 --> 01:15:44,210
- What? - It's ramyeon.

2228
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,220
- It's ramyeon. - "It's ramyeon."

2229
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,850
- It's ramyeon. - Shall we go with ramyeon?

2230
01:15:46,855 --> 01:15:47,950
I think it's right.

2231
01:15:47,956 --> 01:15:48,990
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

2232
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:51,720
(They just need to find the headquarter.)

2233
01:15:51,727 --> 01:15:53,090
It could be at the store.

2234
01:15:53,095 --> 01:15:54,560
You are right.

2235
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:55,930
Could it be that you just want to go to the store?

2236
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:57,905
At a place like that...

2237
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,960
(What is that?)

2238
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:03,045
- There it is. - Where?

2239
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:04,670
- Okay. - How did you find that?

2240
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:07,055
(She finds a hint that was hidden in the corner.)

2241
01:16:07,075 --> 01:16:08,610
How did you find that? Good job.

2242
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,710
(What does Mina's hint say?)

2243
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:13,410
Someone in yellow has a Menu Sticker and has an "N" in his or her name.

2244
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:15,080
This is an important hint.

2245
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,650
It's not Momo.

2246
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:18,150
It's not Jae Seok.

2247
01:16:18,153 --> 01:16:19,820
It's either Nayeon or Se Chan.

2248
01:16:19,822 --> 01:16:21,720
(It's either Nayeon or Se Chan.)

2249
01:16:21,723 --> 01:16:23,790
There is a good chance it's Se Chan...

2250
01:16:23,792 --> 01:16:26,390
because he looked very nervous.

2251
01:16:26,395 --> 01:16:27,760
Hold on.

2252
01:16:27,763 --> 01:16:28,830
(Is Se Chan's name tag crooked...)

2253
01:16:28,831 --> 01:16:31,060
(because it contains the Menu Sticker?)

2254
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:33,560
Right? Se Chan's name tag must be hiding something.

2255
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:34,830
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2256
01:16:34,837 --> 01:16:35,870
Let's remove Se Chan's name tag.

2257
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:37,885
(Let's remove Se Chan's name tag and get ramyeon.)

2258
01:16:39,675 --> 01:16:41,140
Shall we take this way to go to the first floor?

2259
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,740
- Let's do that. - Yes. This way is...

2260
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:44,485
They are here.

2261
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:46,880
- Oh. - Oh.

2262
01:16:46,882 --> 01:16:47,910
- Oh. - They are here.

2263
01:16:47,916 --> 01:16:49,450
They are here.

2264
01:16:49,451 --> 01:16:51,750
All right. Did you find some hints?

2265
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:53,120
We found many hints.

2266
01:16:53,121 --> 01:16:55,190
- Is that so? - Yes.

2267
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,920
We searched for a while.

2268
01:16:56,925 --> 01:16:58,560
(They could remove Se Chan's name tag any minute.)

2269
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,635
- We searched for a while. - My goodness.

2270
01:17:00,762 --> 01:17:02,530
(However,)

2271
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:03,590
(they can't make a rash decision.)

2272
01:17:03,599 --> 01:17:06,860
Your hair grew a lot.

2273
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:07,930
(It's a 50-50 chance.)

2274
01:17:07,936 --> 01:17:12,815
(They need a definite hint.)

2275
01:17:13,642 --> 01:17:17,085
Hold on. It's a showdown.

2276
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:19,280
What are they doing? Are they trying to go that way?

2277
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:21,255
I think they are fighting.

2278
01:17:22,517 --> 01:17:23,980
We looked for Team Sweet Potato for a while.

2279
01:17:23,986 --> 01:17:25,320
Really? Did you look for us?

2280
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,680
What? Jae Seok!

2281
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:28,305
(Something is strange about Team Sweet Potato.)

2282
01:17:28,557 --> 01:17:31,190
(Team Sweet Potato has rice.)

2283
01:17:31,193 --> 01:17:32,860
They took rice.

2284
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,060
- We took out Team Rice. - I see.

2285
01:17:35,063 --> 01:17:36,930
Whose name tag did So Min remove?

2286
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:40,130
(Who has the Bomb Sticker?)

2287
01:17:40,135 --> 01:17:42,985
We needed something other than sweet potato.

2288
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:44,770
(Team Suyuk was aiming to get rice.)

2289
01:17:44,773 --> 01:17:47,415
Oh, that's how it went.

2290
01:17:47,609 --> 01:17:48,710
We need to go.

2291
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,140
(They make a move upon finding out that Team Sweet Potato has rice.)

2292
01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:52,025
- What? - We need to go.

2293
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:54,980
(There is a reason why Team Suyuk doesn't hesitate.)

2294
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:56,110
There is a hint.

2295
01:17:56,118 --> 01:18:00,235
Someone in orange has a Bomb Sticker and has an "O" in his or her name.

2296
01:18:00,622 --> 01:18:02,120
You are good at finding hints.

2297
01:18:02,124 --> 01:18:03,690
Someone in orange has a Bomb Sticker and is a member of Running Man.

2298
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:05,020
It's him. It's him.

2299
01:18:05,027 --> 01:18:06,890
- It's Kwang Soo. - He has a Bomb Sticker.

2300
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,030
(They can remove everyone's name tag except for Kwang Soo's.)

2301
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,390
Will you remove someone's name tag?

2302
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,030
(Team Sweet Potato and Team Rice are still having a showdown.)

2303
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,200
Se Chan has the Menu Sticker.

2304
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:13,430
I will remove Se Chan's name tag.

2305
01:18:13,435 --> 01:18:14,500
(Team Sweet Potato has their eyes on Team Ramyeon.)

2306
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:16,445
Here comes Jong Kook.

2307
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:18,040
It's Jong Kook.

2308
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,040
(Team Suyuk aims for Team Sweet Potato.)

2309
01:18:22,044 --> 01:18:23,870
Gosh, rice is...

2310
01:18:23,879 --> 01:18:25,040
Rice is probably the first place.

2311
01:18:25,047 --> 01:18:26,810
Please settle the situation.

2312
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:29,050
- Get rid of these sweet potatoes. - Seriously.

2313
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:31,635
- Here comes Jong Kook. - I don't think...

2314
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,150
he is here for sweet potato and rice.

2315
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:37,820
(He wouldn't go for us.)

2316
01:18:37,826 --> 01:18:40,320
(I most certainly would.)

2317
01:18:40,329 --> 01:18:42,305
Come here, Nayeon.

2318
01:18:42,397 --> 01:18:45,030
(Why is he glaring at us?)

2319
01:18:45,033 --> 01:18:46,060
Come here.

2320
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:49,330
There is no need to get involved in that fight. Hurry up.

2321
01:18:49,338 --> 01:18:51,445
Hurry up.

2322
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,040
- All right. - Let's rip off some name tags.

2323
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:56,470
Team Ramyeon ran away.

2324
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:58,240
Why are you crowding us?

2325
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:01,380
- Let's do it. We need rice. - Let's do it.

2326
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,150
- Okay. Let's rip off the name tags. - Let's go.

2327
01:19:03,151 --> 01:19:04,935
We got them.

2328
01:19:06,588 --> 01:19:08,790
Who has the Bomb Sticker?

2329
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:10,650
- They are coming! - What?

2330
01:19:10,659 --> 01:19:11,860
What is it?

2331
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:13,290
What are they doing?

2332
01:19:13,295 --> 01:19:14,390
(Team Suyuk's hunt begins.)

2333
01:19:14,396 --> 01:19:17,145
- Hey! - What is going on?

2334
01:19:17,566 --> 01:19:20,000
(He runs past Kwang Soo, a member with a Bomb Sticker,)

2335
01:19:20,002 --> 01:19:22,630
(and goes straight to Dahyun.)

2336
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:24,445
Dahyun!

2337
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,225
(Ji Hyo runs towards Mina.)

2338
01:19:28,343 --> 01:19:31,485
(They are ready to take everyone out except for Kwang Soo.)

2339
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:33,080
(Mina is out.)

2340
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:35,425
- Did she remove it? - Yes.

2341
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:38,180
(There is a reason why Dahyun is running so desperately.)

2342
01:19:38,186 --> 01:19:40,120
- It's for the best. - Okay.

2343
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:41,690
We must avoid eliminating someone with a Bomb Sticker.

2344
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:42,920
(Team Sweet Potato's Menu Sticker)

2345
01:19:42,924 --> 01:19:44,960
Go ahead...

2346
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:47,420
and eliminate everyone else.

2347
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:49,105
Dahyun!

2348
01:19:49,364 --> 01:19:50,490
No, no!

2349
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:52,200
(Before she gets help,)

2350
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,800
(Jong Kook removes her name tag.)

2351
01:19:54,803 --> 01:19:55,830
What?

2352
01:19:55,837 --> 01:19:57,630
(The teams' menus get switched.)

2353
01:19:57,639 --> 01:19:58,970
- The menus get switched. - Yes.

2354
01:19:58,974 --> 01:20:00,640
This team has two menus.

2355
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:02,210
Which one will you choose?

2356
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:04,980
We made a decision before we came here.

2357
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,640
- Which one will it be? - Rice.

2358
01:20:06,648 --> 01:20:07,840
- Rice? - Yes.

2359
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:10,725
(Of course it's rice.)

2360
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:12,350
Is that what you wanted?

2361
01:20:12,354 --> 01:20:13,450
- Rice. - You will switch suyuk with rice.

2362
01:20:13,455 --> 01:20:15,565
- Yes. - We like suyuk better.

2363
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:17,090
Doesn't suyuk have a higher chance?

2364
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:19,060
Rice? Why are you doing this?

2365
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:22,290
- We want rice. - Is rice important?

2366
01:20:22,297 --> 01:20:23,890
- Really? - Give us rice.

2367
01:20:23,899 --> 01:20:26,300
It feels like a meaningless move.

2368
01:20:26,301 --> 01:20:28,100
(Team Ramyeon)

2369
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:29,930
(Team Rice)

2370
01:20:29,938 --> 01:20:31,955
(Team Suyuk and Sweet Potato)

2371
01:20:32,107 --> 01:20:33,800
I have no clue.

2372
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:36,940
This will end once we find a hint on the headquarter.

2373
01:20:36,945 --> 01:20:39,380
We really need a hint on the headquarter.

2374
01:20:39,381 --> 01:20:40,480
Let's look for it.

2375
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:42,865
(Now that they have rice, they need to go to the headquarter.)

2376
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:48,020
(Which team will find the headquarter first?)

2377
01:20:48,023 --> 01:20:49,750
There it is! There it is!

2378
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:51,420
- Where? - There it is!

2379
01:20:51,426 --> 01:20:52,720
There is a hint. What is it?

2380
01:20:52,727 --> 01:20:53,860
Okay.

2381
01:20:53,862 --> 01:20:56,860
(They really want a hint on the location of the headquarter.)

2382
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:58,830
Nayeon, you are really good at this.

2383
01:20:58,834 --> 01:21:00,830
- Let's go inside just in case. - Okay.

2384
01:21:00,836 --> 01:21:02,400
Let's open it here.

2385
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:03,800
That was amazing.

2386
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:05,915
You are really good at this.

2387
01:21:06,007 --> 01:21:07,270
What is it?

2388
01:21:07,275 --> 01:21:11,310
(The hint is...)

2389
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,380
- No way. - No way.

2390
01:21:12,380 --> 01:21:13,810
The headquarter is on the first basement floor...

2391
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:15,280
of Annex Building.

2392
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:17,280
- You did a good job. - You did a good job.

2393
01:21:17,285 --> 01:21:19,020
- This is the best. - Let's hurry up and go.

2394
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,180
Let's hurry up and go.

2395
01:21:20,188 --> 01:21:22,820
(They need to go and shout, "Ramyeon".)

2396
01:21:22,824 --> 01:21:23,950
Turn left.

2397
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:26,060
Let's check. It should be at the end.

2398
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,860
It should be at the end. Come here.

2399
01:21:27,863 --> 01:21:29,130
It should be at the end.

2400
01:21:29,131 --> 01:21:32,175
Gosh, they are on a stakeout.

2401
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:34,000
(What should we do?)

2402
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:35,945
It's too dangerous.

2403
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:37,170
It's too dangerous.

2404
01:21:37,172 --> 01:21:39,300
(I am sure Jong Kook will eliminate Team Ramyeon as well.)

2405
01:21:39,307 --> 01:21:41,770
Hold on. Hey, hey.

2406
01:21:41,776 --> 01:21:43,870
It would be the best to get a car ride.

2407
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:46,140
(He is witty.)

2408
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:48,450
Let's get a car.

2409
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,780
Are you serious?

2410
01:21:49,784 --> 01:21:50,910
Nayeon and you should go without us.

2411
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:53,620
You know what I mean, right?

2412
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:55,920
- Shall we call a taxi? - Can we ask people in that car?

2413
01:21:55,924 --> 01:21:57,820
- A car came in. - Let's ask.

2414
01:21:57,826 --> 01:22:00,435
Jae Seok is something else.

2415
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:02,560
How did he think of this?

2416
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:05,460
Seriously. I need to learn from him.

2417
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,530
Sir.

2418
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:08,130
(He carefully approaches the car.)

2419
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:09,700
If I may ask, where is this car headed?

2420
01:22:09,704 --> 01:22:11,955
This is the president's car.

2421
01:22:12,174 --> 01:22:14,300
(President?)

2422
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:16,570
Is this the president's car?

2423
01:22:16,578 --> 01:22:18,040
When is he coming out?

2424
01:22:18,046 --> 01:22:20,110
- In 3 minutes. - In 3 minutes?

2425
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:22,950
- It's the president's car. - Can't we wait and ride with him?

2426
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:24,650
We can't do that to the president.

2427
01:22:24,653 --> 01:22:26,395
- We can't do that to the president. - Really?

2428
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:28,805
The car belongs to the president of SBS.

2429
01:22:30,892 --> 01:22:33,990
Nayeon's confidence tells me she has a Bomb Sticker.

2430
01:22:33,995 --> 01:22:37,330
The fact that Nayeon has no fear whatsoever tells me...

2431
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:40,000
- she has the Bomb Sticker. - Really?

2432
01:22:40,001 --> 01:22:42,200
I think Se Chan has the Menu Sticker.

2433
01:22:42,204 --> 01:22:44,230
- His eyes tell me so. - I think she is right.

2434
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,900
- His eyes tell me so. - That's right.

2435
01:22:45,907 --> 01:22:47,970
I think Nayeon has the Bomb Sticker.

2436
01:22:47,976 --> 01:22:49,310
Where are they?

2437
01:22:49,311 --> 01:22:51,880
Team Ramyeon was stalling over there.

2438
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,265
I think they saw us.

2439
01:22:55,417 --> 01:22:56,550
Why won't anyone come?

2440
01:22:56,551 --> 01:22:57,610
(They are still trying to hitchhike.)

2441
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:59,680
Maybe people think we are shooing them away.

2442
01:22:59,688 --> 01:23:01,690
This way. This way.

2443
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,650
- This way. This way. - Please come this way.

2444
01:23:03,658 --> 01:23:05,320
This way. Sir.

2445
01:23:05,327 --> 01:23:08,430
(A van slows down.)

2446
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:10,905
- Sir. - You should go and ask.

2447
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,775
Sir, are you busy by any chance?

2448
01:23:14,469 --> 01:23:18,970
In that case, would you help us get to that place?

2449
01:23:18,974 --> 01:23:20,700
It won't take long.

2450
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:22,140
- Over there? - Yes.

2451
01:23:22,143 --> 01:23:23,640
Okay. Come.

2452
01:23:23,645 --> 01:23:26,255
Okay. Nayeon, come here. Hurry up.

2453
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:27,680
Nayeon, hurry up and get in.

2454
01:23:27,682 --> 01:23:29,410
Go that way.

2455
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:30,780
Hurry up and get in.

2456
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:32,020
Thank you, sir.

2457
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,780
(Nayeon and Se Chan take a car to the headquarter.)

2458
01:23:34,789 --> 01:23:37,020
- Let's go. - Let's spread out.

2459
01:23:37,025 --> 01:23:38,050
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok and Momo will divert attention.)

2460
01:23:38,059 --> 01:23:41,120
This is like a spy movie.

2461
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:43,560
- Hide the camera. - Hide it.

2462
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,030
Shall we wait here?

2463
01:23:45,033 --> 01:23:48,415
- Here? - Team Orange is over there.

2464
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:50,000
(They stake out at an alley Team Ramyeon frequents.)

2465
01:23:50,005 --> 01:23:52,300
I have the perfect scenario.

2466
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:54,100
Team Ramyeon...

2467
01:23:54,109 --> 01:23:56,410
fights against us and makes it to the headquarter.

2468
01:23:56,411 --> 01:23:57,770
Then they shout out, "Ramyeon",

2469
01:23:57,779 --> 01:23:59,380
but the crew goes, "It's incorrect."

2470
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:01,380
Then the answer would be rice.

2471
01:24:01,383 --> 01:24:04,280
Then we can take over and shout, "Rice".

2472
01:24:04,286 --> 01:24:06,835
It will be convenient, right?

2473
01:24:07,555 --> 01:24:10,565
(They focus on the stakeout.)

2474
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:13,920
If they come, they will see us.

2475
01:24:13,928 --> 01:24:15,575
(Team Ramyeon, come on.)

2476
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:18,530
(Team Ramyeon is moving secretly in a van.)

2477
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:20,500
You should go to the back.

2478
01:24:20,502 --> 01:24:22,230
- Hold on. - Team Suyuk is there.

2479
01:24:22,237 --> 01:24:25,570
(Team Rice is before their eyes.)

2480
01:24:25,573 --> 01:24:27,040
Hold on.

2481
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:28,540
I am so nervous.

2482
01:24:28,543 --> 01:24:31,285
(They try to enter the building from the opposite side.)

2483
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:34,055
If this plan fails, it will be over.

2484
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:37,050
If they get caught,

2485
01:24:37,052 --> 01:24:39,020
- it will be over. - I know.

2486
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,720
- Are you getting off? - Yes, we are.

2487
01:24:40,722 --> 01:24:43,350
Thank you. Hold on, hold on.

2488
01:24:43,358 --> 01:24:45,935
Hold on, hold on.

2489
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:49,560
(While Jong Kook looks the other way,)

2490
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:51,190
(they succeed to get off the van.)

2491
01:24:51,199 --> 01:24:53,015
Thank you.

2492
01:24:55,003 --> 01:24:57,130
(If Jong Kook turns his head,)

2493
01:24:57,138 --> 01:25:00,615
(their plan will fail.)

2494
01:25:01,543 --> 01:25:05,010
(Team Ramyeon succeeds to enter the building.)

2495
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:08,995
(They must stand on the platform and shout out the answer.)

2496
01:25:10,218 --> 01:25:12,380
(If ramyeon is the 1st place, Team Ramyeon wins.)

2497
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:14,280
(If it isn't, the entire team is out.)

2498
01:25:14,289 --> 01:25:15,350
Let's go.

2499
01:25:15,357 --> 01:25:17,565
(If it isn't, the entire team is out.)

2500
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,760
(Victory is near.)

2501
01:25:20,762 --> 01:25:22,030
Now! Get them!

2502
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,330
(However,)

2503
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,230
(Team Sweet Potato and Team Suyuk suddenly come out.)

2504
01:25:27,235 --> 01:25:29,300
(When Team Ramyeon was hitchhiking, inside the building,)

2505
01:25:29,304 --> 01:25:31,670
(Team Sweet Potato and Team Suyuk found hints on the headquarter.)

2506
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:37,885
(They will wait until Team Ramyeon's arrival and ambush them then.)

2507
01:25:40,348 --> 01:25:43,710
(Se Chan has the Menu Sticker. Let's eliminate Se Chan.)

2508
01:25:43,718 --> 01:25:46,680
(Team Sweet Potato and Team Suyuk are sure Se Chan is their target.)

2509
01:25:46,688 --> 01:25:50,920
(With any hesitation, they removed...)

2510
01:25:50,925 --> 01:25:53,520
(Se Chan's name tag.)

2511
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:55,690
- No. - I got his name tag.

2512
01:25:55,697 --> 01:25:58,830
He removed my name tag. He removed mine.

2513
01:25:58,833 --> 01:26:00,660
He just eliminated me. He got my name tag.

2514
01:26:00,668 --> 01:26:02,400
- What is he then? - He's the bomb.

2515
01:26:02,404 --> 01:26:04,100
(They were certain Se Chan had the Menu Sticker.)

2516
01:26:04,105 --> 01:26:05,840
- He removed my name tag. - He's the bomb.

2517
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,500
(Se Chan isn't the one with the Menu Sticker?)

2518
01:26:07,509 --> 01:26:08,870
He's the bomb.

2519
01:26:08,877 --> 01:26:11,570
(Then who are the bomb and menu of Team Ramyeon?)

2520
01:26:11,579 --> 01:26:15,665
(Se Chan had the Bomb Sticker while Nayeon had the Menu Sticker.)

2521
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,050
You just eliminated the bomb.

2522
01:26:17,051 --> 01:26:18,210
What happens now?

2523
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:19,880
(All of their menus will be passed onto Team Ramyeon.)

2524
01:26:19,888 --> 01:26:22,720
- He was the bomb? - Seok Jin. Goodness, Seok Jin.

2525
01:26:22,724 --> 01:26:24,920
(I can't believe Se Chan was the bomb.)

2526
01:26:24,926 --> 01:26:26,960
I did not see that coming.

2527
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:29,905
Is this it? Hold on.

2528
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:31,230
Let's go.

2529
01:26:31,232 --> 01:26:32,660
I'll start now.

2530
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,330
- Wait, is it rice? - My goodness.

2531
01:26:34,335 --> 01:26:36,985
Why did we get suyuk? It's confusing us.

2532
01:26:38,206 --> 01:26:41,040
Where is it? Is it in the basement?

2533
01:26:41,042 --> 01:26:42,970
- I'm going to... - Is it suyuk?

2534
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:45,440
- Nayeon. - count now.

2535
01:26:45,447 --> 01:26:47,580
Is it ramyeon or suyuk?

2536
01:26:47,582 --> 01:26:48,880
Choose 1 of the 2. You can pick anything.

2537
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:49,950
- If you're out, you're out. - Should we go with suyuk?

2538
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:50,950
(Contemplating)

2539
01:26:50,952 --> 01:26:53,935
(In no time, Jihyo is right next to Nayeon.)

2540
01:26:54,255 --> 01:26:56,690
(If her name tag is removed, they'll lose everything, and it's over.)

2541
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:58,120
The first place is ramyeon!

2542
01:26:58,126 --> 01:26:59,860
(Rushing)

2543
01:26:59,861 --> 01:27:01,620
(She blurted out her answer in a hurry.)

2544
01:27:01,629 --> 01:27:04,805
(Is ramyeon in 1st place?)

2545
01:27:05,633 --> 01:27:09,845
(1st place was ramyeon!)

2546
01:27:10,104 --> 01:27:11,940
- We were right! - Yes!

2547
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:14,240
- We were right! - It was ramyeon!

2548
01:27:14,242 --> 01:27:15,970
- Jae Seok! - Yes!

2549
01:27:15,977 --> 01:27:17,840
- Ramyeon won! - Amazing!

2550
01:27:17,846 --> 01:27:19,955
Ramyeon won!

2551
01:27:20,248 --> 01:27:22,550
It was Kimchi Special with TWICE.

2552
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:24,450
The winning team is...

2553
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:25,850
Team Ramyeon.

2554
01:27:25,854 --> 01:27:28,905
(Team Ramyeon wins the Kimchi Special.)

2555
01:27:30,091 --> 01:27:33,190
According to conducting a survey on a total of 500 people,

2556
01:27:33,194 --> 01:27:35,960
ramyeon won first place with 42.8 percent of the votes.

2557
01:27:35,964 --> 01:27:36,960
- That's quite high. - Gosh.

2558
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:40,460
Therefore, Team Suyuk, Team Rice, and Team Sweet Potato,

2559
01:27:40,468 --> 01:27:44,345
will carry out seasoning 100 heads of Napa cabbages.

2560
01:27:45,106 --> 01:27:48,870
(100 heads of Napa cabbages? Is this really happening?)

2561
01:27:48,877 --> 01:27:52,555
(There's no giving up on it.)

2562
01:27:52,614 --> 01:27:55,680
(They really want to give up on these Napa cabbages.)

2563
01:27:55,683 --> 01:27:56,680
(Don't think about going home yet.)

2564
01:27:56,684 --> 01:27:59,120
- I will give you a chance... - Really?

2565
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:03,090
to transfer all of 100 Napa cabbages to 1 team.

2566
01:28:03,091 --> 01:28:06,120
(It's their last chance to avert the penalty.)

2567
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:07,120
(Only one team will face the penalty.)

2568
01:28:07,128 --> 01:28:09,530
Only 1 team will season 100 heads of Napa cabbages?

2569
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:11,860
- Girls, let's go for this. - Let's do this.

2570
01:28:11,866 --> 01:28:15,585
He's the Mr. Cabbage for today's Kimchi Special.

2571
01:28:15,603 --> 01:28:18,330
- What's that? - He has the cabbage on his head.

2572
01:28:18,339 --> 01:28:19,700
That's cabbage on his head.

2573
01:28:19,707 --> 01:28:20,840
(Notice that he's not the pirate.)

2574
01:28:20,842 --> 01:28:21,970
He's cute.

2575
01:28:21,976 --> 01:28:24,970
A member from each team will stick in the sword.

2576
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:28,140
The team that makes him pop out will season 100 Napa cabbages.

2577
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:29,680
We'll go first.

2578
01:28:29,684 --> 01:28:30,750
- Sure. - Okay.

2579
01:28:30,752 --> 01:28:32,850
- We'll go second then. - It's all the same, anyway.

2580
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:35,720
Actually, the bomb was Jeongyeon.

2581
01:28:35,723 --> 01:28:38,920
But the real bomb, So Min, will go first.

2582
01:28:38,927 --> 01:28:41,120
- Please no. - I'm giving you a chance.

2583
01:28:41,129 --> 01:28:42,745
(So Min had the worst luck today.)

2584
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:45,330
So Min, if he pops out now,

2585
01:28:45,333 --> 01:28:47,600
- you'll be... - It will be treasonous.

2586
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:49,545
Pop out! Pop out!

2587
01:28:49,837 --> 01:28:53,340
(Will So Min's bad luck continue?)

2588
01:28:53,341 --> 01:28:56,570
(If he pops out now, they'll season 100 Napa cabbages.)

2589
01:28:56,578 --> 01:29:00,710
(She's saved.)

2590
01:29:00,715 --> 01:29:01,740
(Team Rice passes for now.)

2591
01:29:01,749 --> 01:29:02,950
It didn't pop out.

2592
01:29:02,951 --> 01:29:04,150
- Sana. - Sana.

2593
01:29:04,152 --> 01:29:06,720
- I don't think I can do this. - Get the green one.

2594
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:07,850
Do you want to go first?

2595
01:29:07,855 --> 01:29:09,390
(Sana doesn't seem confident.)

2596
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,690
You must push it in completely.

2597
01:29:10,692 --> 01:29:12,760
I'm scared.

2598
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:16,145
(If it pops out, they'll face the penalty. What's the result?)

2599
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:19,630
(How lucky. He didn't pop out.)

2600
01:29:19,634 --> 01:29:21,030
(Team Suyuk passes too.)

2601
01:29:21,035 --> 01:29:22,070
Good job.

2602
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,370
(Well done, Sana.)

2603
01:29:24,372 --> 01:29:25,500
- Should I try? - Do you want to?

2604
01:29:25,506 --> 01:29:27,400
(Chaeyoung from Team Sweet Potato sets out.)

2605
01:29:27,408 --> 01:29:28,970
Check if you pushed it in.

2606
01:29:28,977 --> 01:29:30,940
- Why don't you push it again? - That's all right.

2607
01:29:30,945 --> 01:29:32,540
- Okay, okay. It went in. - This is it?

2608
01:29:32,547 --> 01:29:33,710
- That's it. - It went in.

2609
01:29:33,715 --> 01:29:35,140
(Don't provoke the cabbage man.)

2610
01:29:35,149 --> 01:29:36,580
It's in.

2611
01:29:36,584 --> 01:29:37,580
Okay, okay.

2612
01:29:37,585 --> 01:29:39,150
(Team Sweet Potato safely passes too.)

2613
01:29:39,153 --> 01:29:40,350
(After going around once,)

2614
01:29:40,355 --> 01:29:41,480
(Mr. Cabbage is still intact.)

2615
01:29:41,489 --> 01:29:44,120
- Jeongyeon. - I might make it pop out.

2616
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:45,620
- Come on. - It might come out.

2617
01:29:45,627 --> 01:29:47,690
- That's all right. It won't. - Good luck.

2618
01:29:47,695 --> 01:29:50,005
- Where should I push this in? - No.

2619
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:51,190
Anywhere.

2620
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:52,400
(You'll be fine.)

2621
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,100
- Please save our team. - No.

2622
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:57,330
- Not yet. - I think this will pop out.

2623
01:29:57,338 --> 01:29:59,055
(Feeling anxious)

2624
01:30:00,241 --> 01:30:02,340
(Just like she said, Mr. Cabbage really popped out.)

2625
01:30:02,343 --> 01:30:06,955
(Team Rice will face the penalty of seasoning 100 Napa cabbages.)

2626
01:30:08,182 --> 01:30:12,450
(We have to finish seasoning 100 heads of Napa cabbages, right?)

2627
01:30:12,453 --> 01:30:14,220
- We're doomed. - You must do all of them.

2628
01:30:14,222 --> 01:30:16,950
This is over now. Do they have to finish all of them?

2629
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:18,565
Goodness.

2630
01:30:18,726 --> 01:30:19,820
Jeongyeon, you're incredible.

2631
01:30:19,827 --> 01:30:22,230
All you did today was stealing.

2632
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,230
(She only stole the cabbage leaves.)

2633
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,545
What are we going to do?

2634
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:27,630
Get lost! You annoying jerks.

2635
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:29,945
(He has lost his senses.)

2636
01:30:30,038 --> 01:30:32,800
- Let's make kimchi. - Let's finish quickly and go home.

2637
01:30:32,807 --> 01:30:35,955
- I wonder what happened at the end. - Yes, I'm curious. What happened?

2638
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:37,240
(They still put a lot of effort into it.)

2639
01:30:37,245 --> 01:30:38,840
I should put a lot of paste in it.

2640
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:40,140
Yes, spread a lot.

2641
01:30:40,148 --> 01:30:44,050
Make sure you spread it between the leaves and stuff the inside.

2642
01:30:44,052 --> 01:30:45,250
At this rate, who will...

2643
01:30:45,253 --> 01:30:46,850
Hey, do you want to do an acrostic poem?

2644
01:30:46,854 --> 01:30:48,750
- Pardon? - Yes, how about kimchi? Rice.

2645
01:30:48,756 --> 01:30:50,720
- I'll do one with rice. - Go ahead.

2646
01:30:50,725 --> 01:30:53,435
It's chilly. Do you want to go clubbing?

2647
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:54,560
Continue.

2648
01:30:54,562 --> 01:30:57,905
(Humming)

2649
01:30:58,332 --> 01:31:01,075
- Isn't that an old song? - I guess it is.

2650
01:31:01,135 --> 01:31:03,230
Can you do one with kimchi?

2651
01:31:03,237 --> 01:31:05,085
A poem with kimchi?

2652
01:31:05,173 --> 01:31:06,340
I have one, Haha.

2653
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:08,925
- Kim. - Kim Jong Kook.

2654
01:31:09,143 --> 01:31:10,670
- Go on. - Are you kidding me?

2655
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:13,295
(Kim Jong Kook. Are you kidding me?)

2656
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:15,750
Jong Kook isn't here, right? Is he?

2657
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:16,780
(I was kidding, Jong Kook.)

2658
01:31:16,784 --> 01:31:19,495
- Are you kidding me? - Please edit this part out.

2659
01:31:20,655 --> 01:31:23,620
(In no time, they're almost done making 100 heads of kimchi.)

2660
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:25,720
Put them in the containers, and your penalty is over.

2661
01:31:25,727 --> 01:31:26,820
(Put them in the containers, and your penalty is over.)

2662
01:31:26,828 --> 01:31:30,005
I'll be honest. From now on,

2663
01:31:30,832 --> 01:31:33,315
I don't think I can eat rice.

2664
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:37,330
Then you should have multi-grain rice from now on.

2665
01:31:37,338 --> 01:31:40,555
(Haha will only have multi-grain rice from now on.)

2666
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:42,570
You finished your penalty.

2667
01:31:42,577 --> 01:31:44,610
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2668
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:45,980

(2018 Year End Special)

2670
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,180
What did I tell you?

2671
01:31:50,184 --> 01:31:53,720
(They will try the missions they failed once again.)

2672
01:31:53,721 --> 01:31:55,180
(We'll be back!)

2673
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:57,890
(It will be a difficult journey.)

2674
01:31:57,892 --> 01:31:59,090
I should've gone there. Darn it.

2675
01:31:59,093 --> 01:32:02,345
(They face the return of harder missions.)

2676
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:04,460
(Their destinations...)

2677
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:06,300
(and their missions...)

2678
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,275
(have become more challenging.)

2679
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:11,400
(Their mission is beyond their imagination.)

2680
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:13,770
(Before they accomplish their mission,)

2681
01:32:13,775 --> 01:32:16,940
(they cannot return.)

2682
01:32:16,944 --> 01:32:18,980
(And...)

2683
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:24,125
(schemes and betrayals engulf the members.)

2684
01:32:24,252 --> 01:32:26,450
(Are they having an internal dispute?)

2685
01:32:26,454 --> 01:32:30,750
(They face the hardest mission of all. What will happen to them?)

2686
01:32:30,758 --> 01:32:32,505
Come on, Mr. Producer!
