1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,310
(The morning in Seoul signals the start of winter.)

2
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,940
I'm starting alone today again.

3
00:00:09,946 --> 00:00:12,545
I'm nervous. What are we doing today?

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,875
Hello.

5
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,980
- Hello. - I'm starting alone today again.

6
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:20,650
Is it because I'm getting a special assignment?

7
00:00:20,657 --> 00:00:23,315
It's very early in the morning.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,190
- Hello. - Hi.

9
00:00:25,195 --> 00:00:28,060
Why did you ask me to come here?

10
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:31,360
For today's race, your teammates will matter a lot.

11
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:32,925
Okay.

12
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:35,230
So Min and Ji Hyo...

13
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:37,565
will be the team leaders for each team.

14
00:00:37,874 --> 00:00:40,070
- I'm the team leader? - Am I the team leader?

15
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:41,310
- Yes. - Yes.

16
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,275
You're all dead.

17
00:00:43,313 --> 00:00:46,110
The team leader must pick up three members of your team...

18
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,450
and drive to the place for the opening segment.

19
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,450
To find where it will be held,

20
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:52,750
you will find out once you have picked up three members.

21
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:56,820
The team that arrives first will get a great advantage.

22
00:00:56,826 --> 00:00:59,585
- I'll go by car? - Yes.

23
00:00:59,963 --> 00:01:01,630
I'm the team leader?

24
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:05,765
I feel like I have been given a great task.

25
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,835
I'll get started. I can just pick up anyone, right?

26
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,140
I have to drive.

27
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:16,235
It's been so long since I drove. This will be a problem.

28
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,310
(The members just heard about the team leaders' mission.)

29
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,745
So Min is the team leader?

30
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,450
Wait, I haven't even been the team leader yet.

31
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,215
I think it was too early for her to be a team leader.

32
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,290
This might make her become too arrogant.

33
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:33,125
(She was the last member to join the show.)

34
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:36,760
Hold on a second. I think Ji Hyo will...

35
00:01:36,766 --> 00:01:39,325
go for Haha first no matter what.

36
00:01:39,602 --> 00:01:41,995
I'm sure Ji Hyo will choose Haha first.

37
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:46,870
(Whom will the team leaders pick first?)

38
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,570
He said whom I'll pick is important.

39
00:01:48,578 --> 00:01:50,480
(It's crucial to today's race.)

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,245
I'll choose the most trustworthy one.

41
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:54,310
Hey.

42
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:55,880
Where are you?

43
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:58,650
I'm near my house. You?

44
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,590
We have to get there quickly.

45
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,790
I know. We have to.

46
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,760
I'm already outside.

47
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,890
Are you?

48
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:08,030
- Yes. - Jae Seok.

49
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:10,900
The director said whom I'll pick will be very important.

50
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
It is.

51
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:13,870
But...

52
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,265
I know you're going to pick up Haha first.

53
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,600
(She gets caught. She's always on Haha's side.)

54
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,770
I know you're going to pick him first.

55
00:02:21,778 --> 00:02:23,510
- All right. - Okay.

56
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,840
We have to hurry.

57
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,810
Okay. I'll call Haha...

58
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,810
and then pick you up. Hold on a second.

59
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:30,645
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

60
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,150
Who is the best...

61
00:02:33,156 --> 00:02:34,650
(So Min's still pondering.)

62
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,650
Who's the best at all games? Who's the best at everything?

63
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,720
Someone who's good at quizzes...

64
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:40,925
and someone who's agile.

65
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,930
Then it's obviously...

66
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,625
Jae Seok.

67
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,030
I'll go to him.

68
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,830
(She picks Jae Seok as well.)

69
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:49,395
Let's go.

70
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,735
Is this the gas pedal? I'm right.

71
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,470
(Driving is still awkward for her.)

72
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,845
Which one's for the blinkers? This? Oh, I'm right.

73
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:03,045
It's been too long since I last drove.

74
00:03:03,653 --> 00:03:05,245
And...

75
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:08,490
I need to pick Jae Seok so that he'll drive for me.

76
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:09,850
I have to go before someone else does.

77
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,360
(I can't let Ji Hyo take him first.)

78
00:03:11,361 --> 00:03:12,860
I'll pick him up.

79
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:13,860
(I can't let Ji Hyo take him first.)

80
00:03:13,863 --> 00:03:15,990
Then I'll discuss with him.

81
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,900
The number you called is busy.

82
00:03:17,901 --> 00:03:19,430
He's on the phone.

83
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:23,835
(Which one of them will get to him first?)

84
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,070
Please let me in.

85
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:26,300
(She wants to switch lanes.)

86
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,370
Please, Mr. Bus.

87
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,005
I should go in right now.

88
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:32,675
(Glancing)

89
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,475
I suck at this.

90
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,380
When should I go?

91
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:38,120
I'll go after that taxi.

92
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:39,320
All right.

93
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,850
This is my chance.

94
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:42,890
(As soon as I get used to driving, I'll come straight for you.)

95
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,020
I did it.

96
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:46,425
(As soon as I get used to driving, I'll come straight for you.)

97
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,690
(Ji Hyo is good at driving.)

98
00:03:47,697 --> 00:03:49,325
Is this the place?

99
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:51,460
(She arrives before So Min does.)

100
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,065
Is he outside?

101
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:54,530
Where is he?

102
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:59,965
(He said he was outside already.)

103
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,370
Oh, there he is.

104
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,110
(So Min arrives soon after.)

105
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,010
(There he is.)

106
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,480
Hello, fellow team member!

107
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,310
(She's happy to see him.)

108
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,820
(Which one of them will meet him first?)

109
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:15,820
Ji Hyo.

110
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,990
(Isn't he Jong Kook?)

111
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:19,760
(Jong Kook is her first pick.)

112
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:22,730
- Is no one else in the car? - You're my first pick.

113
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:24,930
- Let's hurry. - We should.

114
00:04:24,934 --> 00:04:27,230
You have to wear this since we're on the same team.

115
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:28,600
- Okay. - Here.

116
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,170
There he is.

117
00:04:30,173 --> 00:04:31,540
(Why are you opening this one as well?)

118
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,740
- What? - Jae Seok, hop in!

119
00:04:34,744 --> 00:04:35,810
So Min.

120
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,680
You're here quite early.

121
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,980
- Hey, Jae Seok. - Hey.

122
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:42,110
- Do I need to sit back there? - I'm kidding.

123
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,780
Do you want to drive?

124
00:04:43,786 --> 00:04:44,920
Sure.

125
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,780
This is great.

126
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:48,050
You were the closest.

127
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:50,360
You're the best.

128
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,420
(She's glad to have met her driver.)

129
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:53,860
- I knew... - I knew you'd be in Apgujeong-dong.

130
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:56,225
Ji Hyo wouldn't come for me.

131
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,225
I didn't expect much from her.

132
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:00,000
By the way,

133
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:02,430
whom should I pick for the other two members?

134
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:03,540
I'm still thinking.

135
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,670
- Two? - Yes.

136
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,100
The director said whom I pick is important.

137
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:08,875
(She needs to pick her team members and go to the destination.)

138
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:10,910
- What about Se Chan? - Where are we going?

139
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,040
- Call him. - You want me to?

140
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,480
I heard he's at a nearby park.

141
00:05:15,485 --> 00:05:17,920
Then you probably have to turn right here.

142
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,615
It's Jong Kook.

143
00:05:19,923 --> 00:05:21,050
Hey.

144
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,620
Hey, our lovely Se Chan.

145
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,220
Yes, this is your lovely Se Chan.

146
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,060
Where are you?

147
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,660
- I'm in front of the park. - Where?

148
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:31,165
There he is. He's waving.

149
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,500
(Hello, boss.)

150
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:34,800
- Hey. - Hello, sir.

151
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:37,095
- Just get in. - Hurry.

152
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:39,040
- Get in. - I'll hurry.

153
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,740
Get in, our lovely Se Chan.

154
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:41,740
Okay.

155
00:05:41,744 --> 00:05:43,470
(They need to pick 1 more.)

156
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,810
If this is our team composition, we already won.

157
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,675
- Okay! - Okay!

158
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,480
Whom should we pick?

159
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:51,185
Let me think.

160
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:53,485
Who's nearby?

161
00:05:53,623 --> 00:05:55,120
- I think... - Seok Jin...

162
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:57,990
- is the nearest. - Then let's go to him.

163
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,920
But we'll be at a disadvantage during games.

164
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,495
(Jae Seok is rather cold-hearted.)

165
00:06:02,865 --> 00:06:06,100
(He may be nearby but won't be of great help during games.)

166
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,370
(He waits endlessly while exercising.)

167
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:10,100
Why is no one coming?

168
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:13,400
(He keeps fidgeting with his phone that is ever so silent.)

169
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,970
Kwang Soo called.

170
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,805
- He did? - Yes.

171
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,180
- Hello? - Hey, what are you up to?

172
00:06:19,182 --> 00:06:21,550
I'm waiting for you. Where are you? Why aren't you here?

173
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,680
Where are you waiting?

174
00:06:22,685 --> 00:06:24,680
We're still thinking whether to go to you or not.

175
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,680
"We"?

176
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:27,050
(Is someone already in the car?)

177
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:28,685
Whom are you with?

178
00:06:29,292 --> 00:06:31,225
There's someone.

179
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,990
- Are you nearby? - I'm near the department store.

180
00:06:32,996 --> 00:06:34,790
The department store?

181
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:36,290
- I hung up. - Let's see...

182
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:38,065
You did?

183
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:41,300
(As soon as he tells her where he is,)

184
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:42,600
(she hangs up.)

185
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:44,800
(Loss for words)

186
00:06:44,807 --> 00:06:47,170
(Scoffing)

187
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:51,240
(He swallows his pride and calls her back.)

188
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:54,050
(How dare you ask questions and then hang up?)

189
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,550
- We're a bit far from you. - The call got cut off, right?

190
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,220
You didn't hang up, right?

191
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,420
- It was an accident, right? - Yes.

192
00:06:59,422 --> 00:07:01,420
It got cut off.

193
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:02,850
- Wait there. - Okay.

194
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,990
Hold on. We're close...

195
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:06,490
to Kwang Soo and Seok Jin.

196
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:08,730
- Where's Seok Jin? - I'll call him.

197
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,730
His place is very close by.

198
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,100
(She attempts to call Seok Jin.)

199
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:13,500
Seok Jin...

200
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:15,530
- I think... - Whom I pick is important,

201
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,740
- so I was hesitant. - Hey, So Min.

202
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,900
- Seok Jin, where are you? - What?

203
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:22,035
I'm in front of my house.

204
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,180
- He sounds so arrogant. - Where are you?

205
00:07:25,181 --> 00:07:26,540
He doesn't sound too desperate.

206
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,410
- That's not true. - He's not desperate.

207
00:07:28,418 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm very much desperate.

208
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,180
Make an acrostic poem with So Min's name.

209
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:32,250
- Jeon. - Jeon.

210
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:34,920
I love Jeon So Min.

211
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:37,215
Hang up. That's enough.

212
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,360
I... Those little...

213
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:41,590
(He is agitated.)

214
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:43,290
(So Min picked Jae Seok first.)

215
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,665
She's with Jae Seok.

216
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:48,600
There he is.

217
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:49,800
He is.

218
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,170
- He was very near. - You were right.

219
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,540
- He was quite close. - He lives nearby.

220
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,235
Right.

221
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,910
(Is he talking on the phone with someone else?)

222
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:00,610
- Is it Ji Hyo? - I think so.

223
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,110
- Is it? - Ji Hyo.

224
00:08:02,118 --> 00:08:03,850
(Jae Seok is dumbfounded.)

225
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:05,350
I'm in front of my house.

226
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,850
What a traitor.

227
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:08,620
How dare he?

228
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,420
- Seok Jin. - Where are you?

229
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,725
What? Hold on.

230
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:15,060
(Seok Jin spots Jae Seok.)

231
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,060
Goodness.

232
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey, when did you guys arrive?

233
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,230
Gosh, Seok Jin.

234
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:20,730
- Seok Jin... - Forget it.

235
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,370
- Forget it. - Hey.

236
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,535
Ji Hyo, hang up for a second.

237
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,310
Open the door.

238
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,740
"Jeon". Jeonju bibimbap.

239
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:30,170
- Open the door. - Jeonju bibimbap?

240
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:32,110
- "So". So delicious. - Let's take him.

241
00:08:32,115 --> 00:08:35,050
We'll let you in since we have no time.

242
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:36,980
- Did you call Ji Hyo? - You guys are mean.

243
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,750
- Because we didn't pick up? - Goodness.

244
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,450
You're too rude.

245
00:08:40,456 --> 00:08:41,890
But I hung up right away.

246
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,590
What are you talking about?

247
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,190
I hung up.

248
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:47,230
- Goodness. - Seok Jin.

249
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,655
- I think it's the next block. - Wait a second.

250
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,100
There he is.

251
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:53,500
- What is that? - Haha's here?

252
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,000
- Look at him. - Why does he look so dark?

253
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:56,870
- He's too dressed up. - Why are his clothes so big?

254
00:08:56,873 --> 00:09:00,140
(Oversized Leon)

255
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,240
It is indeed Haha.

256
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:02,970
(His fashion sense is from another realm.)

257
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:04,480
Haha, your clothes...

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,075
Haha.

259
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,145
Are you trying to look funny?

260
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,045
(Are you trying to look funny?)

261
00:09:10,086 --> 00:09:11,220
Haha.

262
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,250
Are you trying to become a comedian?

263
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,320
- What is that? - What are you wearing?

264
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:15,450
I like your clothes.

265
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,360
- Are you trying to look funny? - Should I lend you this?

266
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,190
Doesn't my fashion evolve?

267
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:21,090
You're right.

268
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:27,165
(With Haha as their last pick, Ji Hyo's team is finalized.)

269
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,500
- How many do you need? - A total of three.

270
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:30,840
We need one more.

271
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,500
- One more? - Yes.

272
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:33,940
- Whom should we pick? - Let's see.

273
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:36,010
I heard Kwang Soo's nearby.

274
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:38,075
- Kwang Soo? - Yes.

275
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:39,805
It's always the same team members.

276
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,750
Although he may be nearby, choosing him...

277
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:44,620
would complete Team Penalty.

278
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,250
He's right.

279
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:48,120
Come to think of it, you're right.

280
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,850
Maybe we shouldn't pick anyone.

281
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,190
- What? - Let's not pick.

282
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:52,320
No one?

283
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:54,760
(While they're busy discussing about whether to pick him or not,)

284
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:59,395
(there's a lonely man who looks like an old tree during wintertime.)

285
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:04,470
(He keeps looking at his phone, checking to see if it's broken.)

286
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,165
Kwang Soo's calling.

287
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,870
Hey.

288
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:09,010
- Hey. - Where are you?

289
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,710
Just in case you'd get lost, I wanted to explain the route.

290
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,510
- No, we're already here. - We're here.

291
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,345
Really? I'll come down.

292
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:16,880
I see you. Hi.

293
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,950
(He has waited way too long and is very happy to see them.)

294
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:24,015
(Now, he is on his way to them.)

295
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
Jae Seok, hi...

296
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,860
(Speeding away)

297
00:10:26,863 --> 00:10:28,190
Hey! Stop!

298
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,825
(Your team member is still outside, so where are you going?)

299
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,765
(We don't want to get penalized. I think we'll pass.)

300
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,770
(They decide to let him in.)

301
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:39,240
What were you doing?

302
00:10:39,242 --> 00:10:40,440
You're quite fast.

303
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:41,640
(Hello, our last team member.)

304
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:43,210
- Goodness. - What were you doing?

305
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,940
You were quite fast.

306
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,510
You're still quite healthy.

307
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,010
- Get in. - Get in first.

308
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,380
- All right. - Goodness.

309
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:53,450
Jae Seok wasn't interested in having you in our team.

310
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:54,620
What do you mean?

311
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,315
This is great.

312
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,760
- Where do we go? - Where's our destination?

313
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,395
The director said we'd know once our team was created.

314
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you ready to go?

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
- Yes. - Yes.

316
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,730
Before that,

317
00:11:06,736 --> 00:11:09,965
please check your phones for new messages.

318
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,640
Why is he asking us to do that?

319
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,370
(You want us to check our phones?)

320
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:17,280
(What is this message that's been sent to every single one of them?)

321
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,440
"The contents of this message should be a secret."

322
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:21,175
We can't tell each other?

323
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,710
I didn't get that warning.

324
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:27,045
(It doesn't say that in mine.)

325
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,620
"Find the address to your destination."

326
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,885
"The team that takes the flag first gets an advantage."

327
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:35,925
I didn't get that warning.

328
00:11:36,866 --> 00:11:38,600
"The contents of this message should be a secret."

329
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:40,230
What? I can't tell anyone?

330
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:43,200
(A new female team leader is waiting at Banpo Hangang Park.)

331
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:46,370
(She has the address of where the opening will be.)

332
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,240
(One from each team can be her team member.)

333
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:51,610
My message doesn't say it's a secret.

334
00:11:51,614 --> 00:11:53,080
What? Your...

335
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:54,110
(Secret? A new team leader?)

336
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:55,610
Mine doesn't either.

337
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:58,480
(What is going on?)

338
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,390
Please check your text messages.

339
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,590
(Team So Min receives the same text message.)

340
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,655
- I got a text message. - I didn't get any.

341
00:12:04,994 --> 00:12:06,360
I got one too.

342
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,455
"The contents of..." Oh, my.

343
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,130
(It's obvious that Kwang Soo was surprised.)

344
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:13,230
Hold on.

345
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:15,900
He just said, "The contents of..."

346
00:12:15,905 --> 00:12:19,100
But mine doesn't start with that.

347
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,935
What's going on here?

348
00:12:21,644 --> 00:12:23,240
(The team members make eye contact...)

349
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,480
(and start laughing.)

350
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,080
No one is saying anything after reading the message.

351
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,045
It's because of the first line.

352
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,980
- I was so surprised. - The first line...

353
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:35,385
- The first line surprised me. - Me too.

354
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:36,690
My goodness.

355
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,020
(The text message to the team leaders says,)

356
00:12:39,028 --> 00:12:41,030
("The address is hidden in Banpo Hangang Park.")

357
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,990
(The text message to the team members says,)

358
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:45,030
("A new female team leader is waiting at Banpo Hangang Park.")

359
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:48,665
("She has the address of where the opening will be.")

360
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,600
Wait, I think we're here. Banpo District.

361
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:51,840
(They arrive at Banpo Hangang Park as the text message says.)

362
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,870
- Are we here? We're here. - Banpo Hangang Park.

363
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:54,970
- That's right. - We're here.

364
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:56,570
- Should we get out? - Let's...

365
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,980
Let me get out first.

366
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,010
Why are you in such a hurry?

367
00:13:00,016 --> 00:13:01,845
Why are you in a hurry?

368
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:05,450
(The team leader wants to find the opening address,)

369
00:13:05,454 --> 00:13:07,720
(and the team members want to find the new team leader.)

370
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:09,685
I think we're here.

371
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:11,360
- Okay. - Okay.

372
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,990
- You're not going to run, are you? - No.

373
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:14,490
I have to go straight to the bathroom.

374
00:13:14,497 --> 00:13:17,230
You do? So do I.

375
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:18,630
I've been holding it in for so long.

376
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:19,760
It's driving me crazy.

377
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:22,130
(They have to find the new team leader secretly.)

378
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,730
- We should start looking for it. - Where should we look?

379
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:25,140
- What are we looking for? - A flag.

380
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,470
- Is this the place? - Are we here?

381
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:29,305
We're here?

382
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:31,205
What are you doing?

383
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:32,610
What?

384
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:34,950
(They definitely look distracted.)

385
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,750
(The team leader wants to find the opening address.)

386
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,350
Those two are acting strangely.

387
00:13:38,354 --> 00:13:39,620
What's going on?

388
00:13:39,622 --> 00:13:41,450
Do you have a different goal from us?

389
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:43,490
Are you looking for something else than a flag?

390
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,860
- What? - Aren't you looking for a flag?

391
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,655
We're looking for a flag.

392
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:48,230
Hey.

393
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,730
(We're looking for the same thing, right?)

394
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:52,000
Hurry up! We have to find it.

395
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:55,035
Find what? You know something?

396
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,200
The opening address.

397
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,370
(Sorry, we're looking for a new team leader.)

398
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:00,100
Really?

399
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,140
What's going on? Do you have another mission?

400
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:03,840
What are you talking about?

401
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:06,575
(Haha leaves his team.)

402
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,250
(A white car catches his attention.)

403
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,450
(He pretends nothing is happening.)

404
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:12,315
What's going on over there?

405
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:14,520
(That white car must have...)

406
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:17,555
(something inside.)

407
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,155
(Careful)

408
00:14:20,496 --> 00:14:24,630
(His target is the white car. Come up with something, Haha!)

409
00:14:24,633 --> 00:14:26,860
(He decides to pretend he's joining the team...)

410
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:28,600
(and then turn back.)

411
00:14:28,604 --> 00:14:30,465
Hi, Haha.

412
00:14:31,006 --> 00:14:32,770
- Hi. - Hi.

413
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:34,610
It must be inside the park.

414
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,740
(Kwang Soo can feel that Haha knows something.)

415
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,380
(Mumbling)

416
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,980
(It seems like I've been joined by someone who can be a nuisance.)

417
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,850
(The betrayer brothers start to walk the same path.)

418
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:45,480
- Haha. - Yes?

419
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,415
You got the text message, right?

420
00:14:47,623 --> 00:14:48,620
(He already figured it out.)

421
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,655
- You got the text message, right? - Yes.

422
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,455
I'll find her by all means.

423
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:56,295
Where is the flag?

424
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,730
The flag must be around here.

425
00:14:58,734 --> 00:15:00,230
(Those guys must know something.)

426
00:15:00,236 --> 00:15:02,900
(Let's keep pretending we're looking for a flag.)

427
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,535
Wait!

428
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,370
(What's that white car?)

429
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:10,205
(Kwang Soo rushes to the white car.)

430
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,510
(While Haha was looking around,)

431
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:15,250
(Kwang Soo found the new team leader in the white car.)

432
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:18,520
(Lucky me! I have to get in the car.)

433
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:21,850
(Only two can join her. Haha rushes to the car too.)

434
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,690
(What is going on?)

435
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:25,090
Hurry!

436
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:26,720
- Hurry! - I'm in.

437
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:29,155
(They get in the car as fast as they can.)

438
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,795
- Gosh. - Lock the doors.

439
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,470
(The doors are locked.)

440
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:36,870
Who is it?

441
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:38,505
Hold on.

442
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:40,270
We found her.

443
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:41,770
We found the new team leader.

444
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,140
(The epitome of girl crush, Lee Si Young)

445
00:15:43,145 --> 00:15:45,010
Are you the new team leader?

446
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:47,650
(From romance to action,)

447
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,815
(this versatile actress can pull off anything.)

448
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:53,850
(Everyone has a girl crush on this boxer that represents Korea.)

449
00:15:53,856 --> 00:15:57,655
(6 years ago on Running Man, she proved how good she is.)

450
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:00,760
(Passionate team leader Lee Si Young is here!)

451
00:16:00,763 --> 00:16:03,030
- It's been so long. - Si Young.

452
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:04,500
- Si Young. - Yes?

453
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,100
- Si Young. - Hi.

454
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,200
- Si Young. - Si Young.

455
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,230
- I can't believe it. - You were here?

456
00:16:09,238 --> 00:16:12,270
- What happened? - My goodness.

457
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,870
- You betrayers. - This is crazy.

458
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,370
You betrayers.

459
00:16:15,377 --> 00:16:17,370
(What is going on here?)

460
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,110
- Si Young. - She was here.

461
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,750
I had no idea Si Young was here.

462
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,010
Hi.

463
00:16:23,018 --> 00:16:24,650
He's so cheeky.

464
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,450
- He's so cheeky. - Gosh.

465
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:27,720
What's going on?

466
00:16:27,723 --> 00:16:29,220
Hey.

467
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,720
You scumbag.

468
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:32,620
- How can you do this to me? - I'm sorry.

469
00:16:32,628 --> 00:16:34,090
- What did you do? - Go away.

470
00:16:34,096 --> 00:16:35,390
I need to talk to Si Young.

471
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:37,630
You're not on my team anymore? So suddenly?

472
00:16:37,633 --> 00:16:39,600
- Si Young... - I got a text message.

473
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:41,900
locked the doors.

474
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:43,730
What should we do now?

475
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:45,100
What should we look for?

476
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:46,970
Address? Guys!

477
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:49,175
Guys! Team So Min!

478
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:52,510
(Ji Hyo searches the place too.)

479
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,980
I like this team.

480
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:55,350
- It feels so different. - I know.

481
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:56,610
(The new team leader already has the address.)

482
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,520
If I was on Ji Hyo's team today too...

483
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,580
This feels so different.

484
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:01,990
Wait.

485
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,885
There's something here!

486
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:06,360
(Team So Min finds something.)

487
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:07,760
- Wait. - Where?

488
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,595
- So Min! - Where?

489
00:17:10,332 --> 00:17:11,400
I found it!

490
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,630
(They found the address.)

491
00:17:12,635 --> 00:17:15,130
"161, Mokdongseo-ro, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul".

492
00:17:15,137 --> 00:17:16,400
- This way? - It's in Mok-dong.

493
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,700
- It's in Mok-dong. - We have to go to Mok-dong.

494
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:19,240
Let's go. Hurry up.

495
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,965
(The firstcomers will get benefits.)

496
00:17:21,477 --> 00:17:23,040
They found it!

497
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,445
Should we just follow them?

498
00:17:25,981 --> 00:17:27,710
Did they see us?

499
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:28,810
Let's go!

500
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,810
I think we're all headed to the same place.

501
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,845
161, Mokdongseo-ro... Hold on.

502
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,855
Follow them.

503
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,890
They're moving.

504
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:42,630
(Team Ji Hyo starts to follow Team So Min.)

505
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,060
I think we'll definitely win.

506
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:46,230
- Definitely. - We should win.

507
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:47,830
I'm serious today.

508
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:49,535
So am I.

509
00:17:49,571 --> 00:17:52,740
When they asked me, I chose you two.

510
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:53,740
- Really? - Yes.

511
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:56,540
- I told them I wanted you two. - Really? Thank you.

512
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,680
I wasn't going to let others in.

513
00:17:58,681 --> 00:17:59,980
Seriously?

514
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:02,450
(They're so happy to be on the same team for now.)

515
00:18:02,451 --> 00:18:03,980
(A moment later)

516
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:06,250
(You jerk!)

517
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:10,290
(Verbal and physical violence?)

518
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,720
(Punching)

519
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:12,790
(A national boxer's punch?)

520
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:16,225
(What's going to happen to this team?)

521
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:19,500
(You'll soon find out the truth behind the Lee Si Young incident.)

522
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:23,070
(Team Si Young arrives at the SBS headquarters.)

523
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:26,365
- We're here. - Hurry. There must be something.

524
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:29,070
(To win, you have to pull out the flag.)

525
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:30,170
There's a flag.

526
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,440
Where?

527
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:32,540
This is it?

528
00:18:32,548 --> 00:18:33,580
Hold on.

529
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,245
We did it!

530
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:36,880
What happens now?

531
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:40,445
You arrived first, and you'll get benefits.

532
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:42,820
I like it.

533
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:44,590
(It was a good idea to betray the others.)

534
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:46,890
Is there nothing here?

535
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:50,430
(Nothing is left for Team So Min and Team Ji Hyo.)

536
00:18:50,432 --> 00:18:52,300
- It's over. - It's over.

537
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:53,530
It's over.

538
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:57,000
Today's hidden team leader was...

539
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,105
Lee Si Young.

540
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,570
- Hi. - It's been so long.

541
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:04,640
I saw a bus advertisement on my way here.

542
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,810
It was an advertisement for her new movie.

543
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,680
- You shot a movie? - Yes.

544
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,750
- It's an action movie. - It's an action movie, right?

545
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,880
- "Action"? - "Action".

546
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:14,490
I didn't use any doubles.

547
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,520
- Really? - I did everything myself.

548
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,090
Can you show us some self-defense moves?

549
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,220
- Should I show you a little? - Please.

550
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:21,630
There are different stages.

551
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,890
Show us a lot. Use Kwang Soo.

552
00:19:22,898 --> 00:19:24,800
Please stand here.

553
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,030
Show us a lot.

554
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,470
Let's say you grabbed me by the collar.

555
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,630
I grabbed you by the collar?

556
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:31,140
- Let's pretend. - It can happen.

557
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,000
I grabbed you by the collar.

558
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,270
(How will Si Young deal with it?)

559
00:19:34,276 --> 00:19:36,010
- You should all try. - It can happen.

560
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:37,540
- It can happen. - Let's pretend.

561
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:39,310
- They can do that to you. - I grabbed you by the collar.

562
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:40,940
You grabbed me by the collar.

563
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:43,710
(Using her body weight, she drags Kwang Soo down.)

564
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,380
(The bad guy falls to the ground.)

565
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,480
It's very simple.

566
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:49,090
I didn't fake it.

567
00:19:49,091 --> 00:19:51,485
- I didn't fake it. - It's real.

568
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,760
- It works. - This...

569
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:56,190
So Min, try it.

570
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:57,760
(When grabbed by the collar,)

571
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:02,030
(how will So Min react?)

572
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:04,070
Not that.

573
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,440
(Jae Seok lets go of her because he's dumbfounded.)

574
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:07,440
You should sit down.

575
00:20:07,443 --> 00:20:09,670
My goodness.

576
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:12,680
Try it on Seok Jin. Sit down.

577
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:14,280
Hey!

578
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,550
Get your act together!

579
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:17,310
(Will she be able to follow the instructions this time?)

580
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,145
(She gets stopped.)

581
00:20:19,388 --> 00:20:22,450
Don't just hold his hands.

582
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,820
Use your body weight.

583
00:20:23,826 --> 00:20:25,990
So Min, you should use your body weight.

584
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:27,520
- Use your body weight. - This was nice.

585
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,460
- Try it. - Put your weight on it.

586
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,730
(Will she be different after the lesson?)

587
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,500
I sat down for you.

588
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,430
(They train their legs together.)

589
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:36,630
I sat down for you.

590
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:38,270
- I sat down for her. - Si Young, try it.

591
00:20:38,273 --> 00:20:39,770
- She can't do it. - Si Young, try it.

592
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,340
She can't do it.

593
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,740
Si Young, try it.

594
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:44,780
You sat down for her? Si Young, try it.

595
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,440
- She can't do it. - You sat down for her?

596
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:49,380
(Let the female warrior show him the right way.)

597
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,180
- It's no problem. - Si Young, show him.

598
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:52,550
(I think I can resist.)

599
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:53,980
(Will Seok Jin be able to resist?)

600
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,985
Grab me by the collar.

601
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:58,115
Don't sit down for her.

602
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,785
(He falls.)

603
00:21:01,697 --> 00:21:03,490
(Don't sit down, just lie down! Big Nose Man)

604
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:04,760
She's different.

605
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:06,630
- My goodness. - She's different.

606
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:08,730
- It was different. - You have some poop on your pants.

607
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:10,230
(You have some poop on your pants.)

608
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,235
- Hey. - What's that?

609
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:15,210
(He was already embarrassed.)

610
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,510
It's really poop!

611
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:19,010
What is this?

612
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:20,980
- It's really poop! - You got poop on your pants.

613
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:22,280
(It's true.)

614
00:21:22,284 --> 00:21:23,810
Let me show you...

615
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,880
- It's amazing. - something easier.

616
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:28,420
When someone grabs you from behind, you can do something really easy.

617
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:29,750
Grab her from behind.

618
00:21:29,758 --> 00:21:31,960
- But he's too tall. - You have to grab me tightly...

619
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,090
so I can't escape.

620
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:34,855
Like this.

621
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,760
I'll do it for real.

622
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:39,230
If someone grabs you like this, it's difficult to lose him.

623
00:21:39,234 --> 00:21:40,730
Then...

624
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,270
If someone grabs you like this, it's difficult to lose him.

625
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:45,400
What you do is, you push your bottom to the back.

626
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,170
And move your arm like this.

627
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:50,105
(Push out the bottom and use the arm and legs to make him fall.)

628
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:52,910
(This way, you can protect yourself even from a tall person.)

629
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,410
I see. That's cool.

630
00:21:54,416 --> 00:21:55,410
It's completely possible.

631
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,880
- It will work on you too. - Me?

632
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,420
I bet it does.

633
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,020
- I'll grab you. - You grab me.

634
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:05,055
(Will Si Young's self-defense work on Jong Kook?)

635
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,820
Right.

636
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:07,960
Goodness.

637
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:11,525
(Her charisma dominates him immediately.)

638
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:12,830
That was...

639
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:15,430
- Are you okay? - It really works.

640
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:18,700
That's amazing. Try it, So Min.

641
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:21,105
- After you do that, you should run. - Try it, So Min.

642
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,705
(Come on, come on.)

643
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,940
Push out your bottom. No, use the other leg.

644
00:22:25,948 --> 00:22:27,480
What was that?

645
00:22:27,482 --> 00:22:30,710
(She falls down after using the wrong leg.)

646
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:33,015
(Use the other leg.)

647
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,950
What did you do?

648
00:22:34,957 --> 00:22:37,090
What's wrong with you?

649
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,890
What's wrong with you, So Min?

650
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,090
Why can't I do it?

651
00:22:40,095 --> 00:22:42,560
- Si Young is impressive. - She's impressive.

652
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:44,390
- I knew it. - She's different.

653
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,900
Si Young's passion is impressive.

654
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,170
Everyone, did you bring your passport?

655
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:51,400
Yes, I brought it because you told me.

656
00:22:51,406 --> 00:22:53,940
I brought my passport and suitcase just in case.

657
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:57,980
Among all of your global missions from the past,

658
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,040
you'll make another attempt at those you had failed.

659
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,580
- Those we failed? - Make another attempt?

660
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:06,250
It's the Year End Special, Losers Bracket.

661
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,880
- What? - Like the Giant Swing?

662
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:10,290
(They must clear global missions that they failed.)

663
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:11,560
(Losers Bracket)

664
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,220
(List of countries and missions)

665
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,990
(Tsushima Island, Osaka, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Russia, Mongolia)

666
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:16,990
(Mongolia)

667
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:19,400
(Milk 4 liters of sheep milk)

668
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:21,795
(Mission failed)

669
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:26,000
(Fishing king crabs and 10 types of fish in Russia)

670
00:23:26,008 --> 00:23:28,105
(Mission failed)

671
00:23:28,443 --> 00:23:31,580
(Trying the most recent hairstyles in Osaka)

672
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,345
(Mission failed)

673
00:23:33,415 --> 00:23:35,410
(Trying food recommended by the locals in Okinawa)

674
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,575
(Mission failed)

675
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:39,880
(Be the 100th in line for an experience in Hong Kong)

676
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,615
(Mission failed)

677
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:44,490
(Catching seafood you ate at a restaurant on Tsushima Island)

678
00:23:44,493 --> 00:23:47,720
(Mission failed)

679
00:23:47,729 --> 00:23:51,130
Missions should be cleared at original locations.

680
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,400
Due to shooting complications,

681
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:54,400
you will divide into one Team Hong Kong,

682
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:57,300
and two of Team Gangwon Province.

683
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,400
Like that?

684
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:01,000
Missions will be adjusted...

685
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,310
based on the location.

686
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,670
(Missions will adjust based on the location.)

687
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,880
- Will they be substituted? - Is that so?

688
00:24:05,881 --> 00:24:08,280
- I thought we were traveling. - Okay.

689
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,450
If you fail, the members will be punished based on...

690
00:24:11,453 --> 00:24:13,250
- the number of failed missions. - The number of members?

691
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,690
Yes. Each team will be given 10 votes.

692
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:20,160
You may distribute them within the team.

693
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:22,030
Team Si Young will get...

694
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,230
three additional votes.

695
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:25,300
(Team Si Young gets 3 additional votes.)

696
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,560
That must be nice.

697
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,135
(Clear missions that you had failed once.)

698
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:31,540
So Min and Seok Jin.

699
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,940
- Shall we go to Okinawa? - Let's do that.

700
00:24:32,941 --> 00:24:34,270
That sounds good.

701
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:37,210
- We pick Okinawa. We've been there. - Okinawa.

702
00:24:37,212 --> 00:24:38,540
We have regrets.

703
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:39,980
Let's go with Genghis Khan.

704
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:42,180
- Let's do that. - "Four liters of sheep milk"?

705
00:24:42,184 --> 00:24:44,780
- Sheep milk? - They're over there.

706
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:47,550
There are many sheep in Gangwon Province.

707
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:49,690
- Let's not catch seafood. - How about...

708
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:51,250
We can't fish.

709
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,690
Fishing abroad is difficult, and we might travel abroad.

710
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,690
The hair salon mission is absurd too.

711
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:58,700
We made our decision. In 1, 2, 3.

712
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,830
- Hong Kong. - Hong Kong.

713
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:01,500
Everyone made a decision.

714
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:03,530
This is the most important part.

715
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,240
Random vehicle pick will determine the location of your mission.

716
00:25:07,242 --> 00:25:08,240
- Really? - Is it random?

717
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:09,740
Two vans head to Gangwon Province.

718
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:12,780
One van will take you to the airport where you'll depart for Hong Kong.

719
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:15,105
It hasn't been decided yet.

720
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:18,720
Is it possible to milk sheep in Hong Kong?

721
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,920
It won't be easy to find sheep milk in Hong Kong.

722
00:25:21,923 --> 00:25:22,920
It'll be difficult.

723
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:25,890
- Gangwon Province has a sheep farm. - It's possible.

724
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:28,490
There's a sheep farm, so it's possible over there.

725
00:25:28,497 --> 00:25:31,190
Pick your van. Go.

726
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,825
For the team going to Hong Kong,

727
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,065
what time is their flight?

728
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:38,300
- It'll be in the afternoon. - In the afternoon, right?

729
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:41,105
- Gangwon Province is better. - It's better.

730
00:25:41,777 --> 00:25:43,410
- Let's go. - Shall we go?

731
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:46,410
So Min, choose the van that you want.

732
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:50,150
I hope you two will bring me luck just this once.

733
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:53,180
Let's get on the van that you choose.

734
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,745
But...

735
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,750
- Which one is it? - This one?

736
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:58,760
- All right. - I like this one, Ji Hyo.

737
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,990
- This one? - Let's pick the middle one.

738
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,690
Let's get on the far right.

739
00:26:01,696 --> 00:26:03,390
- This one? - Let's get on this one.

740
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,030
- Okay, this one? So Min. - We pick this one.

741
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:06,960
Doesn't it look like it's going to Gangwon Province?

742
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:09,130
- Okay. - Doesn't it?

743
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:10,300
Let's go.

744
00:26:10,305 --> 00:26:11,995
Let's go to Gangwon Province.

745
00:26:13,008 --> 00:26:14,140
We must get on it.

746
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:16,310
(All teams picked their vans.)

747
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:18,910
(Please let this head to Gangwon Province.)

748
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:19,940
(The driver gives them the destination.)

749
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:22,210
- I'll just open it. - Okay.

750
00:26:22,217 --> 00:26:23,775
Gangwon Province.

751
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:27,380
- Can you see it? In 1, 2, 3. - No way.

752
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:31,315
(We won't go to Hong Kong, will we?)

753
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:33,890
It's Incheon International Airport.

754
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,855
(No way.)

755
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,995
(Is it really Hong Kong?)

756
00:26:40,001 --> 00:26:43,230
(It's hard to clear their mission even in Korea.)

757
00:26:43,238 --> 00:26:45,735
My predictions are never wrong.

758
00:26:45,974 --> 00:26:49,505
Sad predictions are never wrong.

759
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:52,040
(In that case)

760
00:26:52,047 --> 00:26:53,080
It's Gangwon Province.

761
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,750
(Team Si Young heads to Gangwon Province.)

762
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
I knew it.

763
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:57,750
Yes.

764
00:26:57,752 --> 00:26:59,180
(Team Ji Hyo heads to Gangwon Province.)

765
00:26:59,187 --> 00:27:01,080
- Okay. - Thank goodness.

766
00:27:01,089 --> 00:27:02,550
(Team So Min wants to deny the reality.)

767
00:27:02,557 --> 00:27:04,690
Sir, is this going to Incheon International Airport?

768
00:27:04,693 --> 00:27:07,160
- Yes. - It's true.

769
00:27:07,162 --> 00:27:08,660
I asked just in case.

770
00:27:08,663 --> 00:27:11,960
It was a torture with soba and ramen last time.

771
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,760
- It was difficult being nonstop. - It was hard.

772
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:17,000
I wish I wouldn't go abroad with you all the time.

773
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,735
My goodness.

774
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:21,570
We're at the airport.

775
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:24,210
- Goodness. - See you again.

776
00:27:24,212 --> 00:27:26,010
- See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

777
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:27,040
Bye.

778
00:27:27,048 --> 00:27:29,715
(We'll have a blast this time.)

779
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,720
- This is a relief. - We'll be great.

780
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:33,920
(Team Si Young stays at SBS.)

781
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:36,520
We're a perfect team.

782
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,520
We have to do well.

783
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:41,690
We have 13 ballots. Don't we have to distribute them?

784
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,430
I'm the team leader, so I'll decide.

785
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:45,760
- No. - I'm the team leader.

786
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:46,760
(She could be a dictator.)

787
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:47,830
- So I'll decide. - No.

788
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,700
- Listen. - You need to be democratic.

789
00:27:49,704 --> 00:27:52,170
Someone has to keep the ballots.

790
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:53,670
- I'm sorry but... - I'm the team leader.

791
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:55,440
You know what the worst is?

792
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:58,140
Don't simply hold the leader title.

793
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:59,780
- I'm the real team leader. - That's why...

794
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:01,310
- Make us look up to you. - Listen.

795
00:28:01,316 --> 00:28:02,980
- I'm the real one. - We need to pick you.

796
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:05,050
Hey, listen up.

797
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:06,180
(She's impatient.)

798
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:07,380
"Hey, listen up"?

799
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:10,250
I'm the real team leader, so I'll hold on to them.

800
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:12,760
You knew I was the leader, so trust me.

801
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:13,890
Follow my lead. Let's go.

802
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:16,690
If you trust us, give us four ballots each.

803
00:28:16,698 --> 00:28:18,500
Okay, okay.

804
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,730
- For now... - Listen.

805
00:28:19,734 --> 00:28:22,095
- What is it? - I'll give you one each.

806
00:28:22,237 --> 00:28:24,270
My goodness.

807
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,400
Come on.

808
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:27,000
- Come on. - I'll give you one each.

809
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,105
Can I change teams now?

810
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,140
I can't be on a frustrating team like this.

811
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:32,710
- How can you do this? - Listen.

812
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:36,750
Here's your mission for today.

813
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,210
Please open this.

814
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:39,780
Inside this is our real mission.

815
00:28:39,788 --> 00:28:42,585
(What's the mission adjusted to Gangwon Province?)

816
00:28:42,757 --> 00:28:46,220
(Find a descendant of Genghis Khan and milk 4 liters of sheep milk)

817
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,160
- "Gangwon Province". - "King"?

818
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:50,730
"Find a ranch related to the king and milk four liters of sheep milk".

819
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:54,260
Is it okay as long as we relate it to the king?

820
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,530
Okay.

821
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:57,070
The person's nickname could be King.

822
00:28:57,072 --> 00:28:59,400
It could be Annoying King or King Nose.

823
00:28:59,407 --> 00:29:00,400
That's right.

824
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,770
(Annoying King or King Nose?)

825
00:29:01,776 --> 00:29:03,040
"King Nose"?

826
00:29:03,044 --> 00:29:05,140
Let's do some research.

827
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:07,280
- Is there anything king-related? - How about this?

828
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:09,510
Let's go outside and do it.

829
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:10,780
We don't need to hurry.

830
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:13,750
- Finish by Team Hong Kong's return. - Right.

831
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,250
Sheep Farm.

832
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:18,420
There's Samyang Ranch in Daegwallyeong.

833
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:21,555
There's no king ranch in Gangwon Province.

834
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:23,260
I know the answer.

835
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:25,255
It's King Dasan Ranch.

836
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,830
- King Dasan. - You have to call them.

837
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:29,200
This isn't a quiz, Si Young.

838
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:30,400
I'm sorry.

839
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:32,040
You're too much.

840
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,470
Let's call the first ranch that we find...

841
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:37,310
and ask the name of the owner.

842
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:38,310
(They decide to ask the name of the ranch owner.)

843
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:39,580
- Let's ask. - Okay.

844
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,280
- That sounds good. - I'll do it.

845
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,150
- Hello? - Hello?

846
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,480
- Is this a ranch? - Yes.

847
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:49,055
Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo on Running Man.

848
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,520
All of a sudden?

849
00:29:51,526 --> 00:29:53,220
There are no sheep for milking.

850
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:55,530
We don't have sheep that give milk.

851
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,125
You can't milk these sheep.

852
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,560
What do we do? We can't milk any sheep right now.

853
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:03,030
I'll call. We have no choice but keep calling.

854
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:04,200
(It's hard to find a ranch.)

855
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:05,200
Hello?

856
00:30:05,206 --> 00:30:09,970
Hello, we're shooting Running Man right now.

857
00:30:09,978 --> 00:30:12,080
- Yes? - Hello, I'm Lee Kwang Soo.

858
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,180
I see.

859
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:14,910
(Who is Lee Kwang Soo?)

860
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,880
(He doesn't seem to know who he is.)

861
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:19,980
Haha is next to me. Hold on please.

862
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:21,680
Hello.

863
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,150
I'm Haha on Running Man. Hello, sir.

864
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,390
- Hello, Haha. - Hello.

865
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:28,260
(He's excited to hear his voice.)

866
00:30:28,263 --> 00:30:31,725
It's nice to meet you. Do you know Lee Kwang Soo?

867
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:33,200
- I don't. - I see.

868
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:34,230
(His answer is firm.)

869
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,770
(It's a huge embarrassment.)

870
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,230
- Sir? - Yes?

871
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:41,300
It's nice to meet you. We have a mission on Running Man.

872
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:42,310
Can you move aside?

873
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,010
We have to milk four liters of sheep milk.

874
00:30:46,014 --> 00:30:47,710
- Sheep milk? - Yes.

875
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:52,150
Do you have any sheep that can give milk?

876
00:30:52,153 --> 00:30:54,550
Yes, we do.

877
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:56,490
(They finally find someone after 8 attempts.)

878
00:30:56,491 --> 00:31:00,025
Can we get four liters of milk?

879
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,990
- I think... - I'm very tall.

880
00:31:02,997 --> 00:31:03,990
Who cares?

881
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,060
I'm very tall.

882
00:31:06,067 --> 00:31:07,560
Among Korean celebrities,

883
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,770
I'm 1 of the 5 tallest ones.

884
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:12,300
When was the last time you watched Running Man?

885
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,070
- What are you doing? - Wait.

886
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:16,470
Have you seen Running Man?

887
00:31:16,478 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm sorry.

888
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:21,410
You might think that he's Han Gi Beom.

889
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:22,980
- Han Gi Beom? - Yes.

890
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,875
- The basketball player? - Yes.

891
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:27,420
(He doesn't know Lee Kwang Soo but knows Han Gi Beom.)

892
00:31:27,422 --> 00:31:29,990
He knows Han Gi Beom but doesn't know Kwang Soo.

893
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,690
I know him.

894
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:33,690
We went to Yangpyeong High School.

895
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,890
(They're high school colleagues.)

896
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,230
(I should have tried basketball instead.)

897
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:39,560
This is so funny.

898
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,970
(Although their faces are the same, one is popular, and one isn't.)

899
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:44,730
- Sir. - Yes?

900
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:48,470
Do you have anything related to kings or have such connections?

901
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:50,840
- Like you're from a royal family... - I...

902
00:31:50,845 --> 00:31:54,010
(The owner of the ranch doesn't know Kwang Soo at all.)

903
00:31:54,015 --> 00:31:57,410
(Does he have anything related to kings at his ranch?)

904
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:58,750
Yes, my ranch is in Wangsan.

905
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:02,020
(His ranch is related to their keyword, king.)

906
00:32:02,023 --> 00:32:03,390
Wangsan?

907
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,490
- Wangsan? - This is amazing.

908
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:05,560
- What does that mean? - Sir.

909
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,290
The location? He's located in Wangsan?

910
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:09,290
We'd like to head over there and meet you.

911
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:10,530
(The ranch is located in Wangsan, Gangneung of Gangwon Province.)

912
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,330
We'll see you soon. Thank you.

913
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,430
- Okay. - Thank you!

914
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:14,730
This is incredible!

915
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:17,230
- It all worked out. - His ranch is in Wangsan.

916
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:18,500
- That will definitely work. - We'll see you soon.

917
00:32:18,506 --> 00:32:20,500
- This is amazing. - This will definitely qualify.

918
00:32:20,508 --> 00:32:21,970
I can't believe the name happens to be Wangsan.

919
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:23,670
We'll accept the name of the sheep ranch.

920
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,010
(Even the staff will allow it.)

921
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,280
Hey, Joo Yong.

922
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:27,980
When we get there,

923
00:32:27,982 --> 00:32:30,215
you should wear Kwang Soo's jacket...

924
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,480
- and pretend to be Kwang Soo. - What are you saying?

925
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:32,920
- Yes, let's try that. - We don't need to go that far.

926
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,150
- He'll hold the camera. - Must we go that far?

927
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:35,750
Let's check if the owner can recognize you or not.

928
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:36,920
I'm really curious.

929
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,920
- I'm sure he'll recognize me. - Will he?

930
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:42,190
- If not, give us two ballots. - It's just my name.

931
00:32:42,197 --> 00:32:43,730
If he recognizes you, we'll give you one ballot each.

932
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:45,730
- We'll give you ours then. - Let's do that.

933
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:47,500
You're a celebrity and the Prince of Asia. He has to.

934
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,900
- That's right. - You must bet your pride.

935
00:32:48,903 --> 00:32:50,930
(Am I at an advantage?)

936
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:53,440
If he doesn't recognize you, give us all of your ballots.

937
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:54,970
- All of them? - Yes.

938
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:56,310
If you...

939
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:58,140
- Hear me out. - Her logic is weird indeed.

940
00:32:58,146 --> 00:33:00,780
I think she really thinks I'm an idiot.

941
00:33:00,782 --> 00:33:02,580
I know how to add and subtract.

942
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:04,280
This is a good deal for you.

943
00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:05,520
- Think about it. It is. - Listen.

944
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,750
I get only one from each of you, but I give you all of mine?

945
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:08,990
No, listen.

946
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,290
Say that you only have two ballots.

947
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,790
Then you have to give two ballots to each of us.

948
00:33:11,793 --> 00:33:13,220
Then you owe two ballots.

949
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:15,490
When you earn more ballots, you'll have to give them to us.

950
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:18,430
But if you give us everything you have now, it could end with one.

951
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:21,000
Will you give us all of yours? Or just two ballots each?

952
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,230
Are you a couple of scammers?

953
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:24,200
(Are you a couple of scammers?)

954
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:26,040
(They almost convinced him.)

955
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,500
- Haha, am I wrong here? - Listen.

956
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:29,740
- That was really wise. - No, I'm not.

957
00:33:29,744 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll decide after I play the game.

958
00:33:31,512 --> 00:33:33,040
I'll do it. I'll do it by all means.

959
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,740
- Sure. We'll see. - Okay. We can be flexible.

960
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,180
- Okay. Let's get going first. - I understand.

961
00:33:36,184 --> 00:33:37,580
(Can the owner recognize Kwang Soo?)

962
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:39,220
This is the board for the missions.

963
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,320
- Be the 100th in line. - What is it?

964
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:41,920
Be the 100th person in line and go in.

965
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:46,255
We did this mission for the Hong Kong Special.

966
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,830
- It won't be easy in Korea. - Gosh, we're in Gangwon Province.

967
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,455
1, 2, 3.

968
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,160
(Goodness, what is this?)

969
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:55,430
- What? - Goodness.

970
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:56,800
- Oh, gosh. - Treat 100 people to a meal.

971
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:59,140
We must have 100 people line up and treat them to a meal.

972
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,740
Then does it mean we have to cook?

973
00:34:00,742 --> 00:34:02,310
- Do we have to cook too? - Yes.

974
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,105
We have to cook too?

975
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:07,310
It's really hard to cook for 100 servings of food.

976
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:09,080
We have to cook the meals...

977
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,980
and gather people around.

978
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:12,150
And make them line up too?

979
00:34:12,153 --> 00:34:13,680
- Gosh, this is so hard. - This is terrible.

980
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:15,320
Since this is a large-scale mission,

981
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:17,420
we have invited a special guest...

982
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:20,420
- to help you with the mission. - Really?

983
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:21,720
It must be a chef.

984
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:24,425
The guest must be a chef. That will definitely help.

985
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:26,960
(Even his outfit seems unusual.)

986
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:28,730
(Is this the outfit for the armed forces chef?)

987
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,730
(She seems as if she can cook 100 servings without any problem.)

988
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:31,730
That will definitely help.

989
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,340
- The spot next to you looked empty. - I knew it.

990
00:34:33,341 --> 00:34:35,510
There's no way two cameras would film me.

991
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,905
- You're right. - There's no way.

992
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:40,040
- We have a special guest. - Who is it?

993
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,610
Let's go.

994
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:43,810
I hope we get a special guest who can cook.

995
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:47,250
We'll prepare the ingredients while you're on your way there.

996
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:48,580
- Will you buy them for us? - Yes.

997
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,250
Then do we just need to decide...

998
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,320
- on the meal we'll cook? - That's correct.

999
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:54,090
I don't know who this special guest is.

1000
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:55,360
We should listen to the guest.

1001
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:56,960
- You're right. - Right. That's right.

1002
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,800
If the guest is a good cook,

1003
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,030
- The guest will know what to cook. - it's covered then.

1004
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:03,070
Is the guest good at cooking?

1005
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:04,400
I heard the guest is somewhat good.

1006
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:05,940
- That will suffice. - "Somewhat"?

1007
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,440
- Well... - The guest isn't a professional.

1008
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:12,535
The guest must be a TV personality who can cook.

1009
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,480
Wait, if we're turning this way...

1010
00:35:14,482 --> 00:35:16,845
(Wait, if we're turning this way...)

1011
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:19,945
Hold on.

1012
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:22,815
- Come on. There's no way. - Are you serious?

1013
00:35:23,825 --> 00:35:24,990
No way.

1014
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:27,085
(No way. Could it be that person?)

1015
00:35:28,529 --> 00:35:29,630
The guest turned around.

1016
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,425
Can you see the guest? Is the guest there?

1017
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,160
(A special guest to accomplish their mission of cooking 100 servings)

1018
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:37,000
(Who is this special guest?)

1019
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:38,570
Byul.

1020
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:42,775
(Byul, the queen of ballad songs, Haha's wife of 6 years)

1021
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,940
- It is her! - Go Eun!

1022
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,440
(She's another family member.)

1023
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,175
- Hello. - Hi. Hold on. Let me go back.

1024
00:35:49,317 --> 00:35:50,810
We were right about this.

1025
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,420
- Did you guess it was me? - We guessed it right.

1026
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,445
Yes. My gosh, I can't believe this.

1027
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,885
- Go Eun! - Wait, Haha doesn't know?

1028
00:35:58,092 --> 00:36:00,155
- My husband doesn't know. - He doesn't?

1029
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:02,890
- This is fun. He doesn't know. - Really?

1030
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,260
Let's talk while we head there.

1031
00:36:04,265 --> 00:36:05,500
- Sure. - This is unbelievable.

1032
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,760
Byul, did you hear about the mission?

1033
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:09,465
- Do you know what we're doing? - The mission?

1034
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,900
I heard we're cooking today.

1035
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,170
- We don't know much about cooking. - We have to do this.

1036
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:14,940
Do you cook at home?

1037
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,010
I cook soup and side dishes.

1038
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:19,110
I can cook all of the basic dishes.

1039
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:20,210
- Really? - That's great.

1040
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:22,510
- You cook all of your side dishes? - Yes, the basic stuff.

1041
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:24,550
- I can season vegetables. - We're all good. We're set.

1042
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,820
- You're right. - That's perfect.

1043
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,580
(She's totally reliable.)

1044
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:30,150
I looked up some stuff while waiting for you guys.

1045
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:33,090
- The dough soup isn't that hard. - Is that so?

1046
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:34,190
- Really? - It's doable.

1047
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:35,630
- The dough soup? - We should cook...

1048
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,260
- pancakes. Pancakes. - Pancakes?

1049
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:39,500
To cook pancakes, you just need to make a lot of batter.

1050
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,960
All you need to do is fry them.

1051
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:43,130
- Pancakes. - Pancakes.

1052
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:44,930
We have to serve some meat.

1053
00:36:44,939 --> 00:36:46,170
- We should... - Suyuk?

1054
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,440
- Suyuk. Suyuk. Yes. - Yes.

1055
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:48,870
We did think about making suyuk.

1056
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,805
I think that will be nice.

1057
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,610
But tell you what.

1058
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:54,675
- I've cooked before. - Go on.

1059
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,650
Cooking for 2 to 3 servings...

1060
00:36:56,651 --> 00:36:57,910
- and cooking for... - Isn't it different?

1061
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,320
- Yes. - I'm sure. It's so different.

1062
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,080
- Getting the portion right is hard. - Yes, it's really hard.

1063
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:04,015
- Seasoning it is hard too. - Seasoning is hard as well.

1064
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:07,185
- We have to cook in a big pot. - Right.

1065
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:08,520
We might fail, Byul.

1066
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,425
(What if we fail the mission?)

1067
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,800
He probably has no clue.

1068
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:15,800
- Right? - He'll be so shocked.

1069
00:37:15,803 --> 00:37:19,300
(I think I saw my wife in my dream.)

1070
00:37:19,307 --> 00:37:20,900
Byul, how old were you when you got married?

1071
00:37:20,908 --> 00:37:22,340
I was 30.

1072
00:37:22,343 --> 00:37:23,940
- 30? - You married early.

1073
00:37:23,945 --> 00:37:26,140
- You did marry early. - You married early given your job.

1074
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:27,940
Haha was 34 when he married me.

1075
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:29,050
- Haha was 34? - Yes.

1076
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,675
- Haha got married early too. - That's right.

1077
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,880
- He did, given that he played hard. - He was...

1078
00:37:33,888 --> 00:37:35,590
(He did, given that he played hard.)

1079
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,350
- Jong Kook. Don't say that. - I'm sorry.

1080
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,960
- Byul is here. - I'm sorry.

1081
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,460
- I'm sorry. - I really wanted to bring this up.

1082
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:42,960
Dream watches this show.

1083
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:46,425
(Our kid watches this show that requires the viewers' discretion.)

1084
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,130
- Sometimes... - Beep this part.

1085
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:49,230
- Edit this part out. - Dream.

1086
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:50,530
- Beep it out. - It happened today.

1087
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:51,570
Replace it with a chick's sound to make it cute.

1088
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:52,940
- When he meets Kwang Soo, - I didn't know...

1089
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,570
- he grabs Kwang Soo's collar first. - he watches this show.

1090
00:37:54,575 --> 00:37:56,510
Dream watches the show now.

1091
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:57,770
Of course.

1092
00:37:57,778 --> 00:37:59,710
I can't say that now.

1093
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:01,210
I should be more careful now.

1094
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,610
- We must be careful. - My goodness, Dream.

1095
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:06,420
For today's special, please make what I said...

1096
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,690
into a cute expression for Dream.

1097
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:11,620
(Haha doesn't play hard anymore.)

1098
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:15,390
(Dream's father is born again into a new life.)

1099
00:38:15,396 --> 00:38:17,190
- Let's form a club. - Yes.

1100
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:18,260
(Meanwhile)

1101
00:38:18,266 --> 00:38:19,530
What should we name our club?

1102
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,525
We should name our club.

1103
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,900
Let's...

1104
00:38:22,904 --> 00:38:24,030
go with...

1105
00:38:24,038 --> 00:38:25,635
Gangster.

1106
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:28,700
(Haha who doesn't play hard joins a new club, Gangster.)

1107
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,770
The name has two meanings.

1108
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,710
- That could be possible. - He used to be a gangster.

1109
00:38:32,713 --> 00:38:33,880
But he's not a gangster anymore.

1110
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,445
We can give the name more meaning.

1111
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,410
- We're giving like the sheep. - We're giving.

1112
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,050
- We don't spare to give. - We're giving.

1113
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:41,920
We, who don't spare anything to give,

1114
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,090
are the best.

1115
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,020
(Trying to come up with a meaning)

1116
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:46,760
I don't think we'll have a better one than this.

1117
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,090
There are times when things go wrong.

1118
00:38:49,096 --> 00:38:50,530
It's when we go astray...

1119
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,760
- from our original intention. - Right.

1120
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:53,560
- We can use this as our mantra. - We won't think about other stuff.

1121
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,230
- Okay, okay. - We should remind ourselves.

1122
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:57,430
- When someone says, "Like sheep", - Okay.

1123
00:38:57,438 --> 00:38:59,295
We, who spare nothing to give,

1124
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,200
- are the best! - Are the best!

1125
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,610
(A mantra that will help them stay grounded)

1126
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:05,675
The more I hear it, the more I like it.

1127
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,480
- This is great. - It's great.

1128
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,375
(This gangster is feeling proud.)

1129
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,980
I can't believe we haven't even started...

1130
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,715
- our mission yet. - Right.

1131
00:39:13,888 --> 00:39:16,715
- I thought it'd take two days. - At least halfway...

1132
00:39:16,924 --> 00:39:18,620
I think this will be a long journey.

1133
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:20,255
(They fought, found a ranch, and made a slogan.)

1134
00:39:20,361 --> 00:39:21,490
Like sheep,

1135
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,130
- We, who spare nothing to give, - We, who spare nothing to give,

1136
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,130
- are the best! - are the best!

1137
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:25,660
- Exactly. - We spare nothing to give.

1138
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:28,330
(They arrive at a rest area to divide their ballots and eat.)

1139
00:39:28,336 --> 00:39:31,130
Will you divide the ballots now?

1140
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,570
The first place will stay seated.

1141
00:39:33,574 --> 00:39:35,500
The 2nd and 3rd place will leave and come back later.

1142
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,610
As you suggested, Kwang Soo will stay first.

1143
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:41,510
The two of you can go outside and wait.

1144
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:43,880
(Haha and Si Young leave the area for Kwang Soo.)

1145
00:39:43,884 --> 00:39:46,945
(How many of 13 ballots will Kwang Soo take?)

1146
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,350
I'll take 13 ballots.

1147
00:39:48,356 --> 00:39:50,550
(He doesn't even think about it.)

1148
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:56,230
(This is a game of loyalty, but he takes all 13 ballots.)

1149
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,630
(Clueless of this, they're taking selfies with people.)

1150
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:01,195
Two of you can come back in together.

1151
00:40:01,402 --> 00:40:02,570
Come back in together?

1152
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,630
(Why are we coming back together?)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1153
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:05,570
- Pardon? - You said to come in together.

1154
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:06,700
Why should we come in together?

1155
00:40:06,707 --> 00:40:08,670
(What is this? There's nothing on the table.)

1156
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:09,840
- What is it? - Let's eat.

1157
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:11,270
(I took them all.)

1158
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,945
What just happened?

1159
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,140
Is it over?

1160
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:15,240
It's over.

1161
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,110
(The loyalty game of the ballots ends.)

1162
00:40:17,118 --> 00:40:18,910
What happened? Explain what happened.

1163
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,615
What happened?

1164
00:40:20,788 --> 00:40:22,485
I took all 13 ballots.

1165
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,650
I took all 13 ballots.

1166
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,860
He's really like a gangster.

1167
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,760
(She really gets angry.)

1168
00:40:27,762 --> 00:40:30,130
- We had a deal. - I have no choice now.

1169
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:31,530
- We were supposed to get one each. - And I...

1170
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:33,400
I'll post this on my social media now.

1171
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:34,630
- Post what? - Sit down.

1172
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,830
- Listen. - Post what?

1173
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,300
A picture of Kwang Soo's ex-girlfriend.

1174
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:40,400
(He plays the hardest card.)

1175
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:41,400
- Why would you do that? - Let's do this.

1176
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,575
You broke our agreement.

1177
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:46,010
- A verbal agreement still counts. - You know?

1178
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:47,575
I was kidding.

1179
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:48,980
Don't upset me.

1180
00:40:48,983 --> 00:40:50,280
(He generously gives 1 ballot.)

1181
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:51,750
- Don't upset me. - I'm sorry.

1182
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,180
I'm still furious about this.

1183
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:54,920
Then I'll just post her initials.

1184
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:57,150
- I gave you a ballot. - I'll just post her initials.

1185
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:59,090
- I gave you one. - Just the initials.

1186
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:00,190
Listen.

1187
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:02,530
- You think I'd give you just one? - Wait, me too.

1188
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,090
(You think I'd give you just one?)

1189
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,530
- You know? - I'm really hurt too.

1190
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:07,160
- No way. Haha. - What will it be? What?

1191
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:08,500
- I'm Kwang Soo. - I was really shocked.

1192
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:09,830
- I'm like your brother. - Listen.

1193
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,230
Look at me.

1194
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,340
I'm really hurt too.

1195
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,440
Hear me out.

1196
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:16,510
(Let's talk it out.)

1197
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,240
Listen. Hey, hey.

1198
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:19,380
Hold on.

1199
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,010
I get that you know self-defense martial arts.

1200
00:41:21,015 --> 00:41:23,375
You can't get anything if you don't play dirty.

1201
00:41:23,484 --> 00:41:24,510
Si Young.

1202
00:41:24,518 --> 00:41:26,385
Remember? Like sheep!

1203
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,580
- We, who spare nothing to give, - We, who spare nothing to give,

1204
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,190
- are the best. - are the best.

1205
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:32,015
- Give us one more each. - Come on.

1206
00:41:32,093 --> 00:41:35,960
(Haha prepares something while they're arguing.)

1207
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,030
Kwang Soo.

1208
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:38,790
(I prepared this just for you.)

1209
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,900
I'll just show you the first photo.

1210
00:41:40,901 --> 00:41:42,795
- What? - I'll let you check first.

1211
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:44,730
Do you see this?

1212
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,065
Please blur it.

1213
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:49,670
I even have a video of this.

1214
00:41:49,677 --> 00:41:51,070
What's that?

1215
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,710
- What are you doing? - How many can you give me?

1216
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,880
How many can you give me?

1217
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,150
Let me show you the video too.

1218
00:41:57,151 --> 00:41:58,880
It's being blurred, right?

1219
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:01,580
For now, it's blurred.

1220
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:02,750
What's with him?

1221
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,250
This one...

1222
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:05,590
- is amazing. - I gave you some!

1223
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:07,690
- I already gave you some! - After this...

1224
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,260
Give me two more, and I'll leave.

1225
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:11,990
How can I give you two?

1226
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:13,630
Haha, I'll...

1227
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:15,030
(Haha plays the video.)

1228
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,800
- It's a video. - I think you should give him.

1229
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:19,065
(What is the video?)

1230
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,300
(Give him 2 more if you want to keep working as an actor.)

1231
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,700
I have a video.

1232
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,905
- Why did you do that? - Give me two more.

1233
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,270
- Were you drunk? - I'll give you one.

1234
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:27,840
What? I'm just sleeping in that video. I was tired.

1235
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:29,650
And you had no idea?

1236
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,280
I was asleep.

1237
00:42:31,285 --> 00:42:32,480
I'll give you one more.

1238
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:33,580
Give me.

1239
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:34,920
I can't give you more than this.

1240
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,090
(Haha takes 1 more vote away from Kwang Soo.)

1241
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,620
Give it to me. I won't upload this one.

1242
00:42:38,626 --> 00:42:40,460
- Okay. - If you keep doing this,

1243
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:41,890
I won't milk the sheep.

1244
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:42,960
(Shameless)

1245
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:44,760
- Let's go separately. - Send me one of those photos.

1246
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:47,300
(Send me one of those photos.)

1247
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:49,060
Do you know what she just said?

1248
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,195
"Send me one of those photos."

1249
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,500
- She's so funny. - Hey, scumbags.

1250
00:42:53,507 --> 00:42:55,440
That's enough.

1251
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,610
"Scumbag"?

1252
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,840
What did you say?

1253
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,110
- Kwang Soo. - This won't do.

1254
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:01,380
Hold on. Give me a pen.

1255
00:43:01,382 --> 00:43:02,780
Give me a pen.

1256
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:06,715
(Will they be able to milk the sheep today?)

1257
00:43:06,821 --> 00:43:08,180
We're here.

1258
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,920
(Team Ji Hyo arrives in Gangwon Province.)

1259
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:13,655
- I see a senior citizen center. - We'll probably cook with those.

1260
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,655
That's too much.

1261
00:43:15,863 --> 00:43:18,660
There are so many ingredients. It's going to take forever.

1262
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:19,660
(It's a lot.)

1263
00:43:19,667 --> 00:43:20,660
We're doomed.

1264
00:43:20,668 --> 00:43:23,400
We've prepared ingredients for potato dough soup,

1265
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:26,170
suyuk, japchae, and jeon.

1266
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:28,170
Is this for real? Does it even make sense?

1267
00:43:28,175 --> 00:43:31,570
It'll take two hours to just wash them.

1268
00:43:31,579 --> 00:43:32,540
Are they for sale?

1269
00:43:32,546 --> 00:43:35,280
Even the supermarket near my place doesn't have this much.

1270
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,550
Even they don't have this much.

1271
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,550
These are ingredients for dough soup, right?

1272
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:41,480
It's not going to be easy.

1273
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:44,750
All I can do is sigh after seeing all these ingredients.

1274
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:45,960
I mean...

1275
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,990
Come on.

1276
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,420
Hold on.

1277
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,030
I mean...

1278
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,530
Look at this.

1279
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:53,230
It's from the picture...

1280
00:43:53,234 --> 00:43:55,500
you can see at me and Haha's restaurants.

1281
00:43:55,502 --> 00:43:56,500
That's right.

1282
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,530
Exactly.

1283
00:43:57,538 --> 00:43:59,070
- That's right. - Right?

1284
00:43:59,073 --> 00:44:01,170
- Right? - The picture...

1285
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:03,710
- Really? - When we talk to people,

1286
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,710
we should tell them what time the food will be served.

1287
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:07,010
- At 8 or 9... - That's right.

1288
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:08,540
- We have to decide the time. - At this rate,

1289
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,150
- we won't be done until tomorrow. - we won't be done until tomorrow.

1290
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,280
We should ask them if it's okay if we serve the food at 2am.

1291
00:44:13,287 --> 00:44:15,280
We should ask them if it's okay if we serve it as a midnight snack.

1292
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:16,650
Let's start. We don't have time for this.

1293
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,490
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

1294
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,760
I'll work hard.

1295
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,090
What should we do?

1296
00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:23,030
- Let's divide up. - Okay.

1297
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,130
- Let's work hard. - You guys need to hurry.

1298
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:27,130
- Okay. - Don't take too long.

1299
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:28,530
- Let's do this! - Good luck!

1300
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:29,830
- We can do this! - Good!

1301
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:32,000
I get scared just by looking at the ingredients.

1302
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:33,700
Do we have any aprons?

1303
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,675
We should take off our jackets, right?

1304
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,480
Yes, it's too thick. We should take it off.

1305
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,780
Let's start by washing the ingredients.

1306
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:42,780
(The girls start cooking for 100 people.)

1307
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:43,980
(The guys will try to attract 100 people.)

1308
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,480
- We should... - Should we visit that house?

1309
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:47,050
visit each house, right?

1310
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:48,650
I see someone.

1311
00:44:48,656 --> 00:44:49,920
Hello, ma'am.

1312
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:50,920
(They try to sound cute.)

1313
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:53,190
- Do you... - We're shooting "Running Man".

1314
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:54,590
We're shooting "Running Man".

1315
00:44:54,595 --> 00:44:56,825
Do you recognize me?

1316
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,760
- Kim... - Kim.

1317
00:44:58,766 --> 00:45:00,500
Kim.

1318
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,960
Kim Gook Jin?

1319
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,995
(Kim Gook Jin?)

1320
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,265
It starts with "Kim Jong".

1321
00:45:09,743 --> 00:45:11,010
Kim Jong.

1322
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,470
What's the last syllable?

1323
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:13,880
(He tells her almost the whole name.)

1324
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:14,980
- You said it before. - Kim Jong Kook.

1325
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:17,715
(After thinking for a moment, she says, "Kim Jong Kook".)

1326
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:19,650
(Otherwise, he would have been hurt.)

1327
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:21,550
- Kim Gook Jin. - She must have remembered "Kook".

1328
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,190
She remembered "Kim" and "Kook".

1329
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,920
Can you guess who this guy is?

1330
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:26,320
- Do you know my name? - Can you guess his occupation?

1331
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:27,860
- He's... - What?

1332
00:45:27,861 --> 00:45:29,455
(She doesn't even hesitate.)

1333
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:32,630
(While she didn't recognize Jong Kook, she knows Se Chan?)

1334
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:35,660
Isn't he a cameraman?

1335
00:45:35,669 --> 00:45:37,965
(Confident)

1336
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:41,700
(Yang Se Chan, 33, cameraman)

1337
00:45:41,709 --> 00:45:42,770
Ma'am.

1338
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:44,210
That's right.

1339
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:45,935
That one really hurts.

1340
00:45:45,946 --> 00:45:47,540
- It hurts so much. - She hurt you.

1341
00:45:47,548 --> 00:45:49,010
- It hurts... - She hurt you.

1342
00:45:49,016 --> 00:45:50,410
I'm a cameraman.

1343
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:51,550
He is.

1344
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:53,150
He's a cameraman.

1345
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:54,180
(The lady is serious.)

1346
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:57,050
I'm a comedian.

1347
00:45:57,057 --> 00:45:59,460
- Stop it. - I'm...

1348
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,425
- Ma'am. - Leave her alone.

1349
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:05,960
We're shooting "Running Man" today.

1350
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,030
We'd like to cook...

1351
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:09,900
some food for you all.

1352
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,630
We'll serve the food a bit late, around 6:30pm.

1353
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:13,340
Can you come later?

1354
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,100
- I can come. - Really?

1355
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:18,070
- Bring everyone. - Bring all your neighbors.

1356
00:46:18,078 --> 00:46:19,510
- Everyone. - Thank you.

1357
00:46:19,513 --> 00:46:21,380
- Thank you. - I'll bring other people.

1358
00:46:21,382 --> 00:46:23,345
See you later.

1359
00:46:23,484 --> 00:46:25,410
- Let's go this way. - Okay.

1360
00:46:25,419 --> 00:46:26,680
When...

1361
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:28,750
she said I was a cameraman,

1362
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:30,550
I lost all my confidence.

1363
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:32,120
I can't say anything right now.

1364
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,420
- I can't talk to anyone anymore. - It's okay.

1365
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:36,460
It's okay.

1366
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:38,095
It's no big deal.

1367
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:39,290
- This is so funny. - This is so funny.

1368
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:40,965
(It's okay. The next person will recognize you.)

1369
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,230
- Hello. - Hello.

1370
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:44,930
- Welcome. - Hello.

1371
00:46:44,938 --> 00:46:46,500
We're from SBS's "Running Man".

1372
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:48,070
(They find a lady who is working.)

1373
00:46:48,075 --> 00:46:49,610
Ma'am.

1374
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,675
Nice to meet you.

1375
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:54,640
- I've seen you on TV. - Do you know who I am?

1376
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,910
- I don't remember your name. - You don't remember my name.

1377
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:57,980
- Kim. - Kim.

1378
00:46:57,985 --> 00:46:59,310
Jong Kook?

1379
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,215
(Kim Jong Kook?)

1380
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:05,750
Do you know what this guy does?

1381
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:07,260
(Please...)

1382
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,860
(shout out my name.)

1383
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,460
- I'm not sure. - You're not sure.

1384
00:47:10,464 --> 00:47:12,030
(Again)

1385
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,530
I just know who you are.

1386
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:14,960
He's our cameraman.

1387
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,795
He's a cameraman.

1388
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:18,730
She doesn't even look at me.

1389
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,965
I'll work harder.

1390
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:25,010
We'd like to cook some food for you all.

1391
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:27,980
- You don't have to. - It'll be served around 6:30pm.

1392
00:47:27,981 --> 00:47:30,610
If you have time, please come. Please tell your family too.

1393
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:32,550
- Bring everyone. - Okay.

1394
00:47:32,553 --> 00:47:34,150
- Do you want some persimmons? - Persimmons?

1395
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:35,580
- Do you have persimmons? - Please.

1396
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:38,885
Hey, why don't you carry a camera?

1397
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,260
Carry it around.

1398
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:43,130
They look so tasty.

1399
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,630
Please film it. Look at this.

1400
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:47,800
You don't get to see these often.

1401
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:49,570
- Please film me too. - Okay.

1402
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,230
- One second. - They've become too soft.

1403
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,670
- That's enough. - That's enough.

1404
00:47:54,675 --> 00:47:57,270
- Oh, my. That's too much. - That's enough.

1405
00:47:57,277 --> 00:47:59,110
Please keep filming it. What are you doing?

1406
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:01,775
(Please keep filming it. What are you doing?)

1407
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:03,310
Okay. That's enough.

1408
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:04,880
That's enough.

1409
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:07,420
Thank you so much.

1410
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:09,250
I never expected to see you in real life.

1411
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:11,150
(She says goodbye only to Jong Kook.)

1412
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:12,960
- Please come... - How did you come here?

1413
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,020
We just happened to come here.

1414
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:16,130
I see.

1415
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,960
- We'll get going. - Thank you.

1416
00:48:17,965 --> 00:48:20,130
- Thank you for the persimmons. - Bye.

1417
00:48:20,134 --> 00:48:23,070
- Good job. Okay. - Good job. Okay.

1418
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:25,095
Where should we go now?

1419
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:26,670
(Team So Min arrives in Hong Kong.)

1420
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:28,865
Welcome to Hong Kong.

1421
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,110
- I'm suddenly so excited. - So am I.

1422
00:48:31,111 --> 00:48:33,210
- I'm so excited. - You're always like that.

1423
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,040
When you arrive somewhere,

1424
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:37,050
- I get excited. - you get all excited.

1425
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,710
But it doesn't last long.

1426
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:41,920
- You'll become depressed. - It's not going to last long.

1427
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:43,420
You'll soon find out...

1428
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,485
Bye!

1429
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,360
Bye, airplane!

1430
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:49,630
(He reacts enthusiastically to an airplane.)

1431
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,860
- I'm so excited. - You guys know, right?

1432
00:48:51,865 --> 00:48:54,160
He's like this in every opening.

1433
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:56,170
- It's exactly the same every time. - I'm so excited.

1434
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,070
But by the time we're in the city...

1435
00:48:58,071 --> 00:49:00,440
- He becomes lethargic. - "Why do we have to walk so much?"

1436
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,770
- "How long do we have to walk?" - "I can't eat anymore."

1437
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:03,940
(Please stay excited until the end.)

1438
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:07,340
Here's the mission you have to complete in Hong Kong.

1439
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:09,210
- What is it? - What is it?

1440
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,150
In Okinawa,

1441
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:13,580
- we ate noodles. - Yes. We failed.

1442
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:15,215
(Eat the food recommended by a local.)

1443
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:18,490
(In Okinawa, they wanted to have steaks.)

1444
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:19,520
(Soba)

1445
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:21,360
(Ramen)

1446
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:23,855
(Ramen again)

1447
00:49:24,531 --> 00:49:26,500
(They couldn't even smell any steaks...)

1448
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,865
(and got caught up in a noodle maze.)

1449
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,170
Let's try it here.

1450
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:35,440
(What food will they eat in Hong Kong?)

1451
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,170
Hong Kong is known for dim sum.

1452
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:39,110
Then it won't take a lot of time.

1453
00:49:39,112 --> 00:49:41,605
- If it's dim sum, it'll be easy. - Right.

1454
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:44,380
(Will they get to eat dim sum...)

1455
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:45,380
(and complete the mission right away?)

1456
00:49:45,385 --> 00:49:48,480
(Find a local person who recommends the dish the members choose.)

1457
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:49,750
(Hong Kong: Steaks)

1458
00:49:49,756 --> 00:49:51,850
(Steaks?)

1459
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,585
Steaks?

1460
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:56,260
(They were hoping it'd be dim sum.)

1461
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,590
- This is not okay. - Hongdae... Wait.

1462
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,730
- It's Hong Kong. - Hong Kong...

1463
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,660
It's not Hongdae.

1464
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,170
Hong Kong is...

1465
00:50:04,171 --> 00:50:05,830
known for dim sum.

1466
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,070
- Hong Kong is known for dim sum. - Like we said,

1467
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,500
we adjusted the mission to the new country.

1468
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:10,770
Then you should have...

1469
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:13,010
changed it to dim sum.

1470
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,280
There's even no roulette.

1471
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:17,150
Hong Kong is known for its food.

1472
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,480
There are so many good dishes in Hong Kong.

1473
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:19,780
- Steaks... - There are.

1474
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:22,280
We didn't change it because we thought it'd be possible.

1475
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,315
(The staff concluded it'd be possible.)

1476
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:26,860
(In addition to its fascinating night views,)

1477
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,525
(Hong Kong has so many delicious dishes.)

1478
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:34,060
(Along with all the other nice dishes,)

1479
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:38,065
(Hong Kong is known for steaks too.)

1480
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:42,570
Now, you'll pick the conditions for the local person.

1481
00:50:42,576 --> 00:50:44,110
- There are conditions? - There are conditions?

1482
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:47,510
Four different professions are written on this roulette wheel.

1483
00:50:47,514 --> 00:50:50,780
After spinning the wheel, if the local person recommends...

1484
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:53,650
something else other than steaks,

1485
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:57,090
you have to eat that dish before trying again.

1486
00:50:57,090 --> 00:50:58,420
We know that.

1487
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:00,590
It was the same in Okinawa.

1488
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:03,960
Then let's pick the conditions for the local person.

1489
00:51:03,964 --> 00:51:06,025
It'll be the first person we'll meet, right?

1490
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,230
- There are a lot. - "Taxi driver", "store clerk"...

1491
00:51:08,235 --> 00:51:09,400
"Hong Kong old lady".

1492
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:11,030
- "Old lady over 70". - "Old lady over 70".

1493
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:12,070
- "Someone called Wang". - "Someone called Wang".

1494
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:14,000
- Last time, "store clerk"... - There wasn't "old lady" last time.

1495
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:16,340
It has to be an old lady from Hong Kong.

1496
00:51:16,343 --> 00:51:19,335
- Are there many Wangs? - Yes.

1497
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,110
- Here we go. - Let's go.

1498
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:22,540
- Okay. - Let's go.

1499
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:24,110
We have to spin it every time, right?

1500
00:51:24,117 --> 00:51:25,710
- Every time? - I hope it's "taxi driver".

1501
00:51:25,719 --> 00:51:26,780
(This choice might determine the result.)

1502
00:51:26,787 --> 00:51:28,880
Right. That'd be the easiest.

1503
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:32,950
(A taxi driver would be the easiest to find.)

1504
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:35,325
A taxi driver could tell us things like...

1505
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:36,860
It's "taxi driver".

1506
00:51:36,863 --> 00:51:40,400
(A taxi driver is picked.)

1507
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,030
- Jae Seok. - Let's ask...

1508
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:43,730
- on our way. - Let's ask on our way.

1509
00:51:43,737 --> 00:51:46,570
Last time in Okinawa,

1510
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:48,100
- we asked a taxi driver. - It was a taxi driver.

1511
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:49,240
He recommended us a soba restaurant.

1512
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,940
- That's right. - Okay.

1513
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,775
Do you speak Chinese?

1514
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:54,840
- Chinese? - Do you speak Chinese?

1515
00:51:54,848 --> 00:51:56,480
I tried the automatic translator.

1516
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,780
The language spoken in Hong Kong...

1517
00:51:58,785 --> 00:51:59,920
doesn't work.

1518
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,820
- We prepared this for you. - Really?

1519
00:52:02,823 --> 00:52:04,550
Here it is. Try it.

1520
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:07,925
"Excuse me, but could you recommend us a restaurant and a dish?"

1521
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,730
- Goodness. - Look at this.

1522
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,090
- I'll definitely understand. - Since my childhood,

1523
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:13,030
I grew up watching Hong Kong movies.

1524
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:14,130
Me too.

1525
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,630
I watched Chow Yun-fat.

1526
00:52:15,635 --> 00:52:18,330
- Chow Yun-fat. - Chow Yun-fat, Andy Lau,

1527
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:20,000
- Andy Lau. - and Leslie Cheung.

1528
00:52:20,006 --> 00:52:22,000
I grew up watching them.

1529
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,000
"A Moment of Romance".

1530
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:25,005
They represent my high school years.

1531
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:27,540
(Jae Seok doesn't know Cantonese.)

1532
00:52:27,547 --> 00:52:31,375
(These men made him fall in love with Cantonese.)

1533
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,420
(He learned from these men.)

1534
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,420
(Here's my Chinese.)

1535
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:36,550
There's an intonation.

1536
00:52:36,556 --> 00:52:37,550
Listen carefully.

1537
00:52:37,557 --> 00:52:40,020
(Listen carefully.)

1538
00:52:40,026 --> 00:52:44,195
(Speaking Cantonese)

1539
00:52:44,264 --> 00:52:46,060
- What? - What did I say?

1540
00:52:46,066 --> 00:52:47,630
It sounds like Jeolla Province dialect.

1541
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:48,860
(It's definitely Chinese.)

1542
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,630
(However, it sounds like a Korean dialect.)

1543
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:52,600
(He talks in an alien language.)

1544
00:52:52,606 --> 00:52:54,000
- Do you see it? - What do you mean?

1545
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,100
- So Min, do you see this word? - There is.

1546
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:58,110
- Do you see it? - How do we read it?

1547
00:52:58,111 --> 00:52:59,370
We should ask...

1548
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:00,840
- the local. - We should learn.

1549
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:02,380
- Let's go. - Let's go to the city...

1550
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:03,380
- and take a taxi. - Okay.

1551
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:06,115
- Okay. - We should take a taxi in the city.

1552
00:53:06,787 --> 00:53:10,115
I know the lyrics to "Love of the Past".

1553
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:12,250
"Love of the Past"?

1554
00:53:12,259 --> 00:53:16,185
(He sings in Chinese.)

1555
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,425
Seok Jin looks good singing it.

1556
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:22,360
(As they reminisce the past,)

1557
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:27,065
(they go to meet a taxi driver.)

1558
00:53:28,008 --> 00:53:31,840
(The sun sets on the street of Hong Kong.)

1559
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,345
We start to see the night view.

1560
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:37,575
I have the ballots.

1561
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:38,650
Yes.

1562
00:53:38,652 --> 00:53:42,215
(So Min has the ballots.)

1563
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:44,490
- Give them to me. - You shouldn't keep all of them.

1564
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:45,650
How will you distribute them?

1565
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:47,520
- I'll keep them. - I'll keep them...

1566
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:50,760
since I'm the team leader. What if I distribute them...

1567
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,460
by 2, 2, and 6?

1568
00:53:53,467 --> 00:53:55,530
By 2, 2, and 6?

1569
00:53:55,535 --> 00:53:57,570
- "2, 2, and 6"? - So Min.

1570
00:53:57,571 --> 00:54:00,000
- Who gets six? - Hey.

1571
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:02,765
- Has it begun already? - Shall I poke you with my elbow?

1572
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:04,240
- There she goes again. - When you smile,

1573
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:06,270
do you want to have missing front teeth?

1574
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:08,140
Who do you think should be penalized?

1575
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:10,750
- Who do you think? - It's Si Young.

1576
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,345
For me, it's Si Young.

1577
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:14,345
She should be penalized.

1578
00:54:14,387 --> 00:54:15,920
- It should be Haha. - Why?

1579
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:17,550
Haha pretends to be nice.

1580
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:18,950
(He pretends to be nice.)

1581
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:19,960
- I see. - Did you notice?

1582
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,760
- I recognized it. - Suddenly,

1583
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:24,130
- he changed his character. - He used to be a traitor.

1584
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,925
It's not fun at all.

1585
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,360
He said acting nice is his thing these days.

1586
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:29,800
I mean, anyone can do that.

1587
00:54:29,803 --> 00:54:31,070
I've always been nice.

1588
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:32,300
- No way. - At home.

1589
00:54:32,305 --> 00:54:35,070
(I've always been nice.)

1590
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:36,440
- Hey. - You're not mean, but...

1591
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,340
- I'm warmhearted like a heater. - What?

1592
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:40,040
(What is he talking about?)

1593
00:54:40,046 --> 00:54:41,280
- I'm warmhearted like a heater. - No way.

1594
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:42,780
- I am. - Seok Jin.

1595
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:44,550
- You aren't cold, - I'm very warm.

1596
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:46,150
but you aren't warm either.

1597
00:54:46,152 --> 00:54:47,980
In terms of water temperature,

1598
00:54:47,988 --> 00:54:52,320
you aren't as warm as 100°C.

1599
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:53,690
(Seok Jin is lukewarm.)

1600
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:55,820
- It's not the boiling temperature. - Right.

1601
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:57,630
- He's about 60°C. - That's a perfect metaphor.

1602
00:54:57,631 --> 00:54:59,860
- She's good with metaphors. - That was good, So Min.

1603
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,900
- He's about 60°C. - I hadn't thought of it.

1604
00:55:01,902 --> 00:55:03,570
- It's not quite there. - Warm enough for baby formula?

1605
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:05,670
- Yes. - For baby food?

1606
00:55:05,672 --> 00:55:08,700
I imagine you as baby formula.

1607
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:10,670
It's warm enough for baby formula.

1608
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:11,840
Have you ever made baby formula?

1609
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:13,780
I had baby formula since I was born.

1610
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
- Really? - Yes.

1611
00:55:14,781 --> 00:55:18,150
Even after I stopped drinking milk as a child,

1612
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:20,380
I liked baby formula so much that I ate spoonfuls of it.

1613
00:55:20,387 --> 00:55:22,420
- I liked eating that too. - It's really delicious.

1614
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:23,590
Isn't it sweet?

1615
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,920
I don't touch baby formula anymore.

1616
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:27,960
- It can get really addictive. - Right.

1617
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,355
(It's an addiction.)

1618
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,030
That's why I don't touch baby formula anymore.

1619
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,460
- Isn't it tasty? - Sometimes it's on the table.

1620
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:35,530
I really want to eat it, but...

1621
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:36,900
You must have...

1622
00:55:36,903 --> 00:55:38,830
- baby formula at home. - There's a lot of it.

1623
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:41,000
That's right. It's really delicious.

1624
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:44,340
- I want to scoop it with a spoon. - It's so tasty.

1625
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:45,710
- It's delicious. - But I don't do it.

1626
00:55:45,712 --> 00:55:47,110
- It's so nutty. - I don't do it.

1627
00:55:47,113 --> 00:55:49,140
I want something similar to your baby formula.

1628
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:50,750
Do you know peanut butter?

1629
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,280
- I do. - When I take a spoon of it...

1630
00:55:52,285 --> 00:55:54,280
- and eat it... - It's so good.

1631
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:55,320
Why don't you eat it then?

1632
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:57,550
I'll gain weight. You know I watch what I eat.

1633
00:55:57,557 --> 00:55:59,090
"Gain weight"?

1634
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:00,460
- You'll gain weight? - I watch what I eat.

1635
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,460
Didn't you ask for two pieces of bread?

1636
00:56:02,462 --> 00:56:05,095
I eat in the early evening at this hour.

1637
00:56:05,131 --> 00:56:06,130
You don't even have a watch.

1638
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:07,900
- He doesn't have a watch. - He doesn't.

1639
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,030
I thought I did.

1640
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:11,230
- Why did you check? - I know it by feeling.

1641
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:12,900
- Don't be flustered. - I'm old enough...

1642
00:56:12,906 --> 00:56:14,440
- to know by feeling. - Don't be flustered.

1643
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:16,500
Seok Jin's talk isn't interesting either.

1644
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:19,135
It's just boring.

1645
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:24,115
(Seok Jin's talk is lukewarm and boring.)

1646
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:25,550
What did she say?

1647
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:27,550
- It's always... - It's boring.

1648
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,990
It should be exciting.

1649
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,650
Right, what he says isn't interesting.

1650
00:56:32,659 --> 00:56:35,520
Sometimes it's surprisingly amazing.

1651
00:56:35,528 --> 00:56:37,295
That's so funny.

1652
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:40,630
- Look at the night view. - It's beautiful.

1653
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:43,060
- It's amazing. - It's beautiful.

1654
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,995
It's a precious night view.

1655
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,995
I want to take photos.

1656
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:51,340
Let's distribute the ballots fairly.

1657
00:56:51,344 --> 00:56:53,640
The winner of Folding Finger Game gets a ballet.

1658
00:56:53,647 --> 00:56:55,675
- What? - Folding Finger Game.

1659
00:56:55,782 --> 00:56:57,480
The one who folds most fingers loses?

1660
00:56:57,484 --> 00:56:58,880
- Yes. - I see.

1661
00:56:58,885 --> 00:57:00,380
- You're eliminated if you fold all. - Right.

1662
00:57:00,387 --> 00:57:01,380
- Eliminated? - Yes.

1663
00:57:01,388 --> 00:57:03,350
- I'll start. - Okay.

1664
00:57:03,356 --> 00:57:04,350
Fold if you're a woman.

1665
00:57:04,357 --> 00:57:06,960
(His target is So Min.)

1666
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
(Jae Seok is next.)

1667
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:10,455
- That's so cheap. - No, it isn't.

1668
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,530
- You're next. - Fold if you got a nose job.

1669
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:15,260
(How about this? Fold if you got a nose job.)

1670
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:18,130
(He reduced the size of his nose.)

1671
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:20,740
(He folds his finger.)

1672
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,005
Fold if your glasses have no lenses.

1673
00:57:23,443 --> 00:57:25,370
Two of you.

1674
00:57:25,378 --> 00:57:27,840
You're working as a team. Okay.

1675
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:31,750
I'll target only one person.

1676
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:33,310
- I'll target only one person. - Next is Seok Jin.

1677
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,615
Fold if you're shooting a drama.

1678
00:57:36,256 --> 00:57:37,250
- Okay. - 2 to 1.

1679
00:57:37,257 --> 00:57:38,950
- I'm next. - Okay.

1680
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:39,950
(So Min and Seok Jin folded 2 fingers each.)

1681
00:57:39,959 --> 00:57:40,960
Fold if your last name is Jee.

1682
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,585
(He assists So Min.)

1683
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,190
(Mr. Jee folds his finger.)

1684
00:57:45,198 --> 00:57:47,260
My goodness.

1685
00:57:47,267 --> 00:57:49,260
- Okay. - Fold if you use hair powder.

1686
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:51,170
(Fold if you use hair powder.)

1687
00:57:51,171 --> 00:57:53,100
My goodness.

1688
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,400
Hair powder.

1689
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:58,235
Both of you are mocking me.

1690
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:00,040
What are you doing?

1691
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:01,880
- We're not. - Listen.

1692
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:04,150
Come on.

1693
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,550
Do you have to mock me?

1694
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:08,880
This really hurts my pride.

1695
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:11,250
Who suggested this game?

1696
00:58:11,257 --> 00:58:12,750
Next up is Seok Jin.

1697
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:15,260
- Okay, okay. - Okay.

1698
00:58:15,261 --> 00:58:16,760
Fold if you have a bob cut.

1699
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:18,090
- What? - Fold if you have a bob cut.

1700
00:58:18,098 --> 00:58:19,130
- A bob cut. - A bob cut?

1701
00:58:19,132 --> 00:58:21,260
- Goodness. - All right.

1702
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:23,160
(Next is Jae Seok's turn.)

1703
00:58:23,169 --> 00:58:27,340
(He could either eliminate Seok Jin or make their scores tie.)

1704
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,840
- Fold if you're my junior. - Get her.

1705
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:30,940
Fold your finger.

1706
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:34,010
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

1707
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:35,210
(He gets mocked and loses ballots.)

1708
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:37,550
Fold if you're my junior.

1709
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,650
- You fold one. - I did.

1710
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:40,920
Fold if you're my junior.

1711
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,350
(He has to fold his finger.)

1712
00:58:43,356 --> 00:58:46,090
(Junior Seok Jin folds his finger.)

1713
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:47,820
Okay, fine.

1714
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:50,760
- Just don't betray the team. - Okay.

1715
00:58:50,764 --> 00:58:54,030
Let's do well today, Seok Jin.

1716
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,030
- Today... - In one go.

1717
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,730
If we succeed in one go...

1718
00:58:56,736 --> 00:58:58,070
- Please send us home. - We can go home.

1719
00:58:58,071 --> 00:58:59,570
If you clear the mission, you can go home today.

1720
00:58:59,572 --> 00:59:01,070
- Can we go home? - Really?

1721
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:02,070
Can we have free time?

1722
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:03,570
There are early morning flights from Hong Kong.

1723
00:59:03,576 --> 00:59:04,840
- There are until 3am. - Really?

1724
00:59:04,844 --> 00:59:07,110
I promise you that if you clear the mission today,

1725
00:59:07,113 --> 00:59:08,380
you can take the early morning flight home.

1726
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:10,210
- Okay. - Let's try.

1727
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:12,280
- Seriously. - Or we can have fun today...

1728
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:13,410
- and go back tomorrow. - Let's have fun.

1729
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:14,550
We can have free time.

1730
00:59:14,554 --> 00:59:16,420
- Let's have fun. - We will without cameras.

1731
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:18,190
- Without cameras. - Without cameras.

1732
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,925
Here we are. We arrived.

1733
00:59:21,828 --> 00:59:24,360
(They arrive in the city at 6:30pm.)

1734
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:25,630
Where are we?

1735
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:27,400
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1736
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,930
- I can enjoy any food. - Me too.

1737
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:30,930
(They must meet a taxi driver.)

1738
00:59:30,937 --> 00:59:33,100
Please give us a recommendation.

1739
00:59:33,106 --> 00:59:34,440
- There's a taxi. - No.

1740
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,340
It's already taken.

1741
00:59:36,342 --> 00:59:38,905
Is this where we catch a taxi?

1742
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,540
All the taxis are taken.

1743
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:41,780
Let's wait here.

1744
00:59:41,781 --> 00:59:43,910
- There's an empty taxi in the back. - Where?

1745
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,780
(She finds one.)

1746
00:59:45,785 --> 00:59:47,380
There's an empty one here.

1747
00:59:47,387 --> 00:59:48,480
- Where? - Here.

1748
00:59:48,488 --> 00:59:51,420
(They find an empty taxi.)

1749
00:59:51,424 --> 00:59:52,420
Taxi.

1750
00:59:52,425 --> 00:59:54,360
(They finally catch a taxi.)

1751
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,130
(They need a recommendation from the taxi driver.)

1752
00:59:58,131 --> 01:00:00,095
We have to ask carefully.

1753
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,570
- Excuse me. - Hi.

1754
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,130
- You ask. - Excuse me.

1755
01:00:05,138 --> 01:00:06,430
Ask and see if he understands you.

1756
01:00:06,439 --> 01:00:11,740
(He asks him to recommend them a dish.)

1757
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:13,880
- Show it to him. - I'll read it out loud instead.

1758
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,380
Okay.

1759
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:16,640
(Hesitating)

1760
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:18,380
(I...)

1761
01:00:18,384 --> 01:00:21,080
(He speaks Cantonese.)

1762
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:23,250
(What are you reading?)

1763
01:00:23,256 --> 01:00:26,920
(Asking a question is already difficult.)

1764
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,090
- I don't think he understands. - He doesn't?

1765
01:00:29,095 --> 01:00:30,630
- Choose a restaurant. - Please?

1766
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:32,260
- Tell me. - Menu.

1767
01:00:32,265 --> 01:00:33,860
- Menu. - Menu.

1768
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:35,260
- Menu. - Yes.

1769
01:00:35,268 --> 01:00:37,430
(He finally understands.)

1770
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:41,100
(If he recommends steak, they succeed the first mission.)

1771
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:44,135
(What will the driver say?)

1772
01:00:44,477 --> 01:00:46,070
- Menu. - Menu.

1773
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,480
- Menu. - Yes.

1774
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,640
(He finally understands.)

1775
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:53,310
(If he recommends steak, they succeed the first mission.)

1776
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:55,780
(What will the driver say?)

1777
01:00:55,788 --> 01:00:57,790
- Wantanmien. - Yes.

1778
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,550
The noodle.

1779
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:01,820
(Wantanmien is noodles.)

1780
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,985
Okay. Noodles again?

1781
01:01:04,364 --> 01:01:05,990
- Noodles. - Does this continue?

1782
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,530
Okay, wantanmien.

1783
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:08,630
- Wantanmien. - Noodles.

1784
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:10,300
- Okay. Go. - Okay.

1785
01:01:10,303 --> 01:01:11,530
Please.

1786
01:01:11,537 --> 01:01:13,130
- I didn't mishear that, right? - This is driving me nuts.

1787
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:14,240
- He said "noodles". - Noodles.

1788
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,970
It's not like we told him to say that. Noodles again?

1789
01:01:15,975 --> 01:01:17,410
Does the noodles party continue...

1790
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,440
in Hong Kong?

1791
01:01:19,445 --> 01:01:22,040
(They're off to a gloomy start. Will they be okay?)

1792
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:24,950
- Gangwon Province seems to have... - Right?

1793
01:01:24,951 --> 01:01:27,845
- cold air. - I can't sleep.

1794
01:01:28,321 --> 01:01:29,420
Let's go!

1795
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:30,820
(They arrived at the ranch.)

1796
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:32,090
(They have another purpose besides the mission.)

1797
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:33,420
This is D-Day.

1798
01:01:33,426 --> 01:01:36,025
- Protect Kwang Soo's pride! - But...

1799
01:01:36,195 --> 01:01:37,860
- This is the main event. - You can't do that.

1800
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:39,525
(Will the owner recognize Kwang Soo?)

1801
01:01:39,532 --> 01:01:40,530
(If he takes the producer as him, Haha and Si Young take his ballots.)

1802
01:01:40,533 --> 01:01:42,700
Joo Yong, come here. Switch your clothes.

1803
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:44,400
- But... - Good.

1804
01:01:44,404 --> 01:01:45,670
(If he takes the producer as him, Haha and Si Young take his ballots.)

1805
01:01:45,672 --> 01:01:48,905
Don't do anything that makes you stand out.

1806
01:01:49,008 --> 01:01:50,470
- I can't allow myself to do that. - Right.

1807
01:01:50,476 --> 01:01:52,305
That's so cheap.

1808
01:01:52,879 --> 01:01:54,080
My pouch...

1809
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,780
Why would you hold on to it?

1810
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:57,780
- This... - That makes you stand out.

1811
01:01:57,784 --> 01:01:59,210
- Goodness. - No way.

1812
01:01:59,218 --> 01:02:00,550
I'm not trying to stand out.

1813
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:01,550
(Gosh, he saw that.)

1814
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:02,780
If the owner thinks he's Kwang Soo,

1815
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:04,950
should we just go along with it?

1816
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:07,420
(If they think he's Kwang Soo, should we just go along with it?)

1817
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:09,420
(Will Kwang Soo's part be edited out automatically?)

1818
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,090
(That's going too far.)

1819
01:02:11,097 --> 01:02:13,260
It'll be funny if they mention you at the end.

1820
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:14,360
Because...

1821
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:16,060
- they might be... - I'll wait until they recognize me.

1822
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:17,970
embarrassed.

1823
01:02:17,971 --> 01:02:20,640
We'll give you 10 minutes.

1824
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,840
- Let's not laugh. - Okay.

1825
01:02:22,842 --> 01:02:24,010
(He's somewhat bitter.)

1826
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,070
Zip it.

1827
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:28,240
Put it in your ear.

1828
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:29,540
(They're thorough only at times like these.)

1829
01:02:29,549 --> 01:02:31,050
(Sighing)

1830
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,280
That's good.

1831
01:02:32,285 --> 01:02:34,150
(He turns into a staff member.)

1832
01:02:34,153 --> 01:02:35,420
Kwang Soo.

1833
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:37,320
- Do you want my mic? - No, it's okay.

1834
01:02:37,323 --> 01:02:38,420
(Kwang Soo and Producer Lee Joo Yong switch.)

1835
01:02:38,424 --> 01:02:39,420
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1836
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:41,060
We have no time. The sun is setting.

1837
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,760
(They leave to meet the owner.)

1838
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,630
(He's determined and serious.)

1839
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,595
Kwang Soo, join the staff.

1840
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:52,900
Hold the camera next to the audio person.

1841
01:02:52,905 --> 01:02:55,805
Why are we doing... Okay, fine.

1842
01:02:56,075 --> 01:02:57,440
Just do it.

1843
01:02:57,443 --> 01:02:58,510
Should we practice?

1844
01:02:58,511 --> 01:03:00,610
- Like sheep, - We, who spare nothing to give,

1845
01:03:00,613 --> 01:03:01,610
- are the best! - are the best!

1846
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:03,380
(They show great teamwork.)

1847
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:04,550
They might recognize me right away.

1848
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,380
This might end faster than expected.

1849
01:03:06,386 --> 01:03:08,215
(Will Kwang Soo keep both his pride and his ballots?)

1850
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:10,890
He looks so cool.

1851
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,090
Sir.

1852
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:13,690
- Hello. - Hello.

1853
01:03:13,693 --> 01:03:15,220
- Haha. - Nice to meet you.

1854
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:16,360
(Mr. Kang owns a ranch in Wangsan, Gangwon Province.)

1855
01:03:16,362 --> 01:03:18,030
It's very nice to meet you.

1856
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:19,860
There's a beautiful lady as well.

1857
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:21,260
- Hello. - Hello.

1858
01:03:21,267 --> 01:03:24,070
(The fake Kwang Soo approaches Mr. Kang.)

1859
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,170
- Are you Lee Si Young? - Yes.

1860
01:03:27,173 --> 01:03:29,100
(He recognizes Haha and Si Young.)

1861
01:03:29,108 --> 01:03:30,470
- Lee Si Young. Nice to meet you. - It's Lee Si Young.

1862
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:31,840
I'm Lee Kwang Soo. You know me, right?

1863
01:03:31,844 --> 01:03:33,610
- You're short. - I...

1864
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:40,720
(Mr. Kang is suspicious. Will Kwang Soo win?)

1865
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,950
I'm standing on the bottom.

1866
01:03:41,954 --> 01:03:43,550
Oh, you're tall.

1867
01:03:43,556 --> 01:03:44,650
Nice to meet you.

1868
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:47,190
(He doesn't question it.)

1869
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:49,360
It's nice meeting you.

1870
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:51,295
(We're nice to meet you too!)

1871
01:03:51,764 --> 01:03:54,825
(Mr. Kang, it's nice to meet you.)

1872
01:03:55,902 --> 01:03:57,470
(They celebrate overcoming the 1st hurdle.)

1873
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,570
We need to get 4L of milk.

1874
01:03:59,572 --> 01:04:01,400
I'll let you get 5L.

1875
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:02,670
- Really? - Thank you.

1876
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:05,070
- Are the sheep in good health? - Yes, they're good.

1877
01:04:05,078 --> 01:04:06,270
(The sheep are waiting to be milked.)

1878
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:07,880
All right.

1879
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,780
Do you have a question, Kwang Soo?

1880
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:11,380
Is it difficult?

1881
01:04:11,384 --> 01:04:14,420
(He carefully asks a question.)

1882
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:17,290
(Mr. Kang may notice something odd once Producer Lee starts talking.)

1883
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,720
(Staring)

1884
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:22,090
No, you just milk them.

1885
01:04:22,095 --> 01:04:23,860
- There's nothing hard about it. - I'll try my best.

1886
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:26,030
You haven't done it, so it might look hard.

1887
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:29,695
(You're not looking here. Kwang Soo is actually here.)

1888
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:31,530
- Kwang Soo... - Kwang Soo was a little worried.

1889
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:33,670
I'll take a picture for you and Kwang Soo.

1890
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:36,240
Si Young can join as well.

1891
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:39,735
In 1, 2, 3.

1892
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:42,280
That's good. I'll be in it this time.

1893
01:04:42,281 --> 01:04:43,440
In 1,

1894
01:04:43,449 --> 01:04:45,010
- 2... - I'll take it for you.

1895
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:46,280
Sure, please take it for us.

1896
01:04:46,285 --> 01:04:49,880
I think our staff member is taller.

1897
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:52,350
- Right? - In 1, 2, 3.

1898
01:04:52,358 --> 01:04:56,120
(Kwang Soo stands across from Mr. Kang. Will he know?)

1899
01:04:56,129 --> 01:04:59,090
(Let's go, Running Man!)

1900
01:04:59,098 --> 01:05:02,195
In 1, 2, 3.

1901
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:05,070
(Clicking)

1902
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,300
Can you adjust the mic?

1903
01:05:07,306 --> 01:05:08,905
Are you a staff member?

1904
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:10,570
(Are you a staff member?)

1905
01:05:10,576 --> 01:05:13,270
You look like a celebrity.

1906
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:16,440
(This staff member looks like a celebrity.)

1907
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:18,945
He's tall, right?

1908
01:05:19,051 --> 01:05:21,385
You're working hard.

1909
01:05:21,921 --> 01:05:23,785
I think his mic needs to be adjusted.

1910
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,420
(Lee Kwang Soo, a tall staff member who looks like a celebrity)

1911
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:28,090
(He's working very hard.)

1912
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:30,260
We should get going now.

1913
01:05:30,263 --> 01:05:31,690
Oh, dear.

1914
01:05:31,697 --> 01:05:33,630
- It's not hard at all. - Thank you.

1915
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:35,130
Pat them.

1916
01:05:35,134 --> 01:05:36,460
They're very sensitive.

1917
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:39,070
Herbivores are very sensitive.

1918
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,400
You have to pat them with soft hands.

1919
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:42,500
They know when you're being rough.

1920
01:05:42,508 --> 01:05:43,970
I see.

1921
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:47,110
I get scared easily.

1922
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,510
(This mission makes me reflect on my life.)

1923
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:55,050
(He won the Top Excellence award in 2016 Entertainment Awards.)

1924
01:05:55,054 --> 01:06:02,155
(What if he's Asian Prince in other countries?)

1925
01:06:02,695 --> 01:06:05,860
(To Mr. Kang, he's just...)

1926
01:06:05,865 --> 01:06:07,760
We have to get going.

1927
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:10,800
- Mr. Kang, let's go! - Let's go!

1928
01:06:10,803 --> 01:06:13,170
(This is a party.)

1929
01:06:13,172 --> 01:06:14,970
10 minutes have passed.

1930
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:18,510
For 10 minutes, he took Producer Lee as Kwang Soo,

1931
01:06:18,511 --> 01:06:21,845
so Kwang Soo's ballots all go to Haha and Si Young.

1932
01:06:23,216 --> 01:06:25,550
(He loses both his pride and ballots.)

1933
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:26,710
Come here, Kwang Soo.

1934
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:27,880
This is Kwang Soo.

1935
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:29,820
(He's confused.)

1936
01:06:29,822 --> 01:06:32,350
- This is our member Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

1937
01:06:32,358 --> 01:06:33,420
(I see...)

1938
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:34,720
This is our producer.

1939
01:06:34,727 --> 01:06:36,590
- Really? - He's a producer.

1940
01:06:36,596 --> 01:06:37,860
It's true.

1941
01:06:37,863 --> 01:06:38,890
Take this off.

1942
01:06:38,898 --> 01:06:40,190
(You have to switch your jackets again.)

1943
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:41,400
He's not sure yet.

1944
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,560
Why are you taking your jackets off?

1945
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:45,130
(Why is the staff member taking his jacket off?)

1946
01:06:45,137 --> 01:06:46,470
So he...

1947
01:06:46,472 --> 01:06:48,040
He's Lee Kwang Soo.

1948
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,470
I have to wear my own jacket.

1949
01:06:49,475 --> 01:06:50,810
I'm going to wear my jacket.

1950
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:51,970
Right?

1951
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:54,340
(He pretends like he knew.)

1952
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:56,740
You're making me feel even worse, sir.

1953
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:58,750
We played a fun game.

1954
01:06:58,751 --> 01:07:00,150
Thank you, sir.

1955
01:07:00,152 --> 01:07:01,380
Right?

1956
01:07:01,387 --> 01:07:03,785
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1957
01:07:04,056 --> 01:07:05,990
- Give me 13 ballots. - Who is he then?

1958
01:07:05,992 --> 01:07:07,490
He's a producer.

1959
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:09,825
- Right? I didn't recognize him. - Yes.

1960
01:07:10,763 --> 01:07:12,290
Sit in the front, Si Young.

1961
01:07:12,298 --> 01:07:17,695
(They go to the ranch before the sun sets.)

1962
01:07:18,037 --> 01:07:21,200
- You can sit on top of the tire. - Okay.

1963
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:23,170
You can face the back and sit on it.

1964
01:07:23,175 --> 01:07:24,840
You're tall.

1965
01:07:24,844 --> 01:07:26,610
- Yes, it's okay. - It'll be a long journey.

1966
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:28,675
It'll be a difficult journey.

1967
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:32,650
(What does he mean by that?)

1968
01:07:32,652 --> 01:07:34,720
("It'll be a difficult journey.")

1969
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,920
"It'll be a long journey."

1970
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:37,550
(What does he want to warn them about?)

1971
01:07:37,556 --> 01:07:38,650
Are you all right?

1972
01:07:38,658 --> 01:07:42,625
(What does he want to warn them about?)

1973
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:46,990
(Mr. Kang starts the car in silence.)

1974
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:48,260
I'll go up slowly, okay?

1975
01:07:48,267 --> 01:07:49,300
- Okay. - Yes.

1976
01:07:49,302 --> 01:07:52,800
(He starts driving on a steep mountain path.)

1977
01:07:52,805 --> 01:07:54,400
This feels like an adventure.

1978
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:56,300
He's driving across a creek.

1979
01:07:56,309 --> 01:07:57,840
I know.

1980
01:07:57,843 --> 01:08:01,340
I've never done this before.

1981
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:02,510
Are you all right?

1982
01:08:02,515 --> 01:08:05,110
(Where are we going?)

1983
01:08:05,117 --> 01:08:06,150
Oh, no.

1984
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:07,380
(It's a rough unpaved path across a creek.)

1985
01:08:07,386 --> 01:08:09,580
At night, you can get trapped.

1986
01:08:09,588 --> 01:08:11,790
You should be careful when driving.

1987
01:08:11,791 --> 01:08:13,650
I always go back and forth.

1988
01:08:13,659 --> 01:08:14,760
Still.

1989
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,260
(They start seeing something at the end of the path.)

1990
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:18,090
There they are.

1991
01:08:18,097 --> 01:08:19,290
(There they are.)

1992
01:08:19,298 --> 01:08:20,760
- Are they? - The white ones.

1993
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:22,595
I see them.

1994
01:08:22,802 --> 01:08:24,300
Me too.

1995
01:08:24,303 --> 01:08:25,530
(Exclaiming)

1996
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:27,465
They're beautiful.

1997
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,970
(It's a rough path to get here, but the ranch is in a safe area.)

1998
01:08:30,976 --> 01:08:33,510
The dog is so cute too.

1999
01:08:33,512 --> 01:08:35,410
They're bigger than I expected.

2000
01:08:35,414 --> 01:08:38,380
This is what I expected goats would look like.

2001
01:08:38,384 --> 01:08:40,045
I know.

2002
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:43,350
You'll now start milking the sheep.

2003
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:44,790
(It's time to get 4L of milk.)

2004
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:49,260
The big bottles you see on the side add up to 4L.

2005
01:08:49,261 --> 01:08:51,890
The mission is complete once you fill up four of those.

2006
01:08:51,897 --> 01:08:52,890
Okay.

2007
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:54,300
- Let's do this! - Okay.

2008
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,960
Let's do it before the sun sets.

2009
01:08:55,968 --> 01:08:57,430
- They're not moving too much. - Hurry.

2010
01:08:57,436 --> 01:08:58,630
(They must get all 4L while the sheep are active.)

2011
01:08:58,637 --> 01:09:00,530
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2012
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:02,840
- You can do it. - We can do it.

2013
01:09:02,842 --> 01:09:06,210
You should meet the sheep first.

2014
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,775
- Give them some pine needles. - Can I have some?

2015
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:11,510
Hello, guys.

2016
01:09:11,517 --> 01:09:13,050
Would you like some?

2017
01:09:13,052 --> 01:09:14,580
They're big.

2018
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:16,585
They like it.

2019
01:09:17,556 --> 01:09:19,985
There you go. They're eating it.

2020
01:09:20,025 --> 01:09:21,420
She's so cute.

2021
01:09:21,427 --> 01:09:23,260
(The sheep are not scared. They won't have a problem.)

2022
01:09:23,262 --> 01:09:25,090
(Chewing)

2023
01:09:25,097 --> 01:09:26,490
(Running away)

2024
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:27,930
Baby.

2025
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:29,525
Baby?

2026
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:30,770
He's so fast.

2027
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,495
If they go up even more, they might not come back down.

2028
01:09:33,672 --> 01:09:35,670
(However, the other sheep are following him too.)

2029
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:36,840
Eat this.

2030
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:40,710
(However, the other sheep are following him too.)

2031
01:09:40,713 --> 01:09:41,880
Hello. Oh, dear.

2032
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:43,645
Are they running away?

2033
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:45,010
I'm not sure.

2034
01:09:45,017 --> 01:09:46,880
- There are many people. - Yes.

2035
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:48,815
There are too many people all of a sudden.

2036
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:51,290
(What's going on?)

2037
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,120
Can you get them back, Mr. Kang?

2038
01:09:54,126 --> 01:09:55,660
They'll come back once we leave.

2039
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:57,260
(They're running away from the guests.)

2040
01:09:57,263 --> 01:09:58,590
They will.

2041
01:09:58,597 --> 01:09:59,990
- They must be scared. - Come here, guys.

2042
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:02,525
They'll move farther away if we try to move closer.

2043
01:10:02,668 --> 01:10:05,370
Once we go down and ring the bell, they come down.

2044
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:07,100
There are too many people suddenly.

2045
01:10:07,106 --> 01:10:09,035
- Hey. - This...

2046
01:10:09,175 --> 01:10:10,640
I have a bad feeling.

2047
01:10:10,643 --> 01:10:12,340
(We'll milk you and leave right away.)

2048
01:10:12,344 --> 01:10:16,975
(The sheep have hidden. They may not even get to try.)

2049
01:10:17,016 --> 01:10:19,445
(He rings a bell to call the sheep.)

2050
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:21,880
(Will the sheep come back down?)

2051
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,290
- Daddy rang the bell. - They're responding.

2052
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:25,850
They're coming down.

2053
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:27,860
(As soon as they hear the bell, they come down.)

2054
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,590
This is fascinating.

2055
01:10:29,595 --> 01:10:32,230
Shouldn't we get away? Right?

2056
01:10:32,231 --> 01:10:33,230
(Let's go down for now.)

2057
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:35,225
- They're coming so fast. - This is fascinating.

2058
01:10:35,968 --> 01:10:37,630
Go. Let's get away first.

2059
01:10:37,636 --> 01:10:40,065
(Are the guests gone?)

2060
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,240
(The sheep have to come inside now.)

2061
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,470
- This is fascinating. - Come inside, Kwang Soo.

2062
01:10:43,476 --> 01:10:44,810
How did they know?

2063
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:45,840
This is...

2064
01:10:45,845 --> 01:10:47,910
(It's the bell. Get together!)

2065
01:10:47,913 --> 01:10:49,805
Can you close the door?

2066
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:51,980
Come here, guys.

2067
01:10:51,984 --> 01:10:53,080
Can you close the door?

2068
01:10:53,085 --> 01:10:55,620
(They start hesitating.)

2069
01:10:55,621 --> 01:10:58,420
- They are... - Go behind and herd them.

2070
01:10:58,424 --> 01:10:59,920
Come here.

2071
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:01,720
Come inside.

2072
01:11:01,727 --> 01:11:03,120
We have to herd them before they get out.

2073
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,155
- No way. - Herd them and get them in.

2074
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:09,330
(A staff member herds them, but they get out!)

2075
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:10,600
What do we do, Mr. Kang?

2076
01:11:10,603 --> 01:11:13,670
(What's wrong? Where are they going again?)

2077
01:11:13,672 --> 01:11:15,535
Come here. Eat this.

2078
01:11:16,175 --> 01:11:19,310
- What do we do? - Let's go inside.

2079
01:11:19,311 --> 01:11:21,140
What do we do?

2080
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:23,840
We need a person to herd them. Should we do it?

2081
01:11:23,849 --> 01:11:26,215
Should we go out and do it?

2082
01:11:26,385 --> 01:11:27,720
- Should we? - We have to go around.

2083
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,785
- Go this way. - Let's herd them.

2084
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:31,690
Guys, let's go.

2085
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:33,220
- Let's go this way. - Go that way.

2086
01:11:33,225 --> 01:11:34,720
Let's go.

2087
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:37,320
- Let's go this way, guys. - Come here.

2088
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:39,290
Let's go to your daddy.

2089
01:11:39,298 --> 01:11:40,760
- Let's go to him. - Go inside.

2090
01:11:40,766 --> 01:11:42,800
No, please! Please.

2091
01:11:42,801 --> 01:11:44,060
(They run away to the mountains!)

2092
01:11:44,069 --> 01:11:45,130
(This is an emergency situation.)

2093
01:11:45,137 --> 01:11:46,670
That's not the right way.

2094
01:11:46,672 --> 01:11:47,770
(They escape for the 2nd time.)

2095
01:11:47,773 --> 01:11:49,270
What now?

2096
01:11:49,275 --> 01:11:50,600
(They're going even farther now!)

2097
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:53,270
We have to get the cameras out...

2098
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:55,010
and try again.

2099
01:11:55,014 --> 01:12:00,145
(They're in trouble. Can they get 4L of milk?)

2100
01:12:00,553 --> 01:12:01,750
(In Hong Kong, the members are in a taxi.)

2101
01:12:01,754 --> 01:12:03,120
He said "noodles".

2102
01:12:03,122 --> 01:12:06,920
I think the whole world knows that you like noodles.

2103
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:09,560
- You like noodles. - I do love noodles.

2104
01:12:09,562 --> 01:12:11,830
They know.

2105
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:13,230
- I think... - Here.

2106
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:14,760
- Here? - Here?

2107
01:12:14,767 --> 01:12:17,260
(They must eat the recommended dish first.)

2108
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:19,630
- Here? - Yellow...

2109
01:12:19,638 --> 01:12:23,405
- Yellow. - Yellow. Thank you.

2110
01:12:23,876 --> 01:12:25,340
I was shocked.

2111
01:12:25,344 --> 01:12:27,105
Noodles again.

2112
01:12:27,546 --> 01:12:29,240
Here.

2113
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:31,150
It looks really good.

2114
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:33,410
- It does look good. - It looks really good.

2115
01:12:33,419 --> 01:12:34,680
- Right? - Excuse me.

2116
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:36,080
Wantanmien?

2117
01:12:36,088 --> 01:12:41,315
(Wantanmien is Cantonese-style noodles with shrimp and pork.)

2118
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,260
- Wantanmien? - Yes.

2119
01:12:43,262 --> 01:12:44,560
There's meat too.

2120
01:12:44,563 --> 01:12:45,890
(Next, come.)

2121
01:12:45,898 --> 01:12:47,900
Our staff members have to come.

2122
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,930
(Kwon Ryeol is the only staff here.)

2123
01:12:48,934 --> 01:12:50,560
- Our staff has to come. - Right.

2124
01:12:50,569 --> 01:12:51,730
Excuse me.

2125
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:53,000
(The staff got lost while following the taxi.)

2126
01:12:53,005 --> 01:12:54,840
Where is the staff?

2127
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,140
(This is a real situation.)

2128
01:12:56,141 --> 01:12:59,010
- Should we get seats first? - Right? I think that's better.

2129
01:12:59,011 --> 01:13:01,310
- I can film everybody. - Sure.

2130
01:13:01,313 --> 01:13:03,140
- Sure. - We have no time.

2131
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:04,510
Okay.

2132
01:13:04,516 --> 01:13:06,610
Excuse me. Three.

2133
01:13:06,619 --> 01:13:08,120
(They can't keep waiting, so they enter the restaurant first.)

2134
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,550
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2135
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:11,220
Thank you so much.

2136
01:13:11,223 --> 01:13:12,720
It looks good.

2137
01:13:12,725 --> 01:13:14,590
I wonder how it tastes.

2138
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:16,790
This is our first meal in Hong Kong.

2139
01:13:16,795 --> 01:13:20,495
(How will it taste?)

2140
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,630
Wantanmien.

2141
01:13:22,635 --> 01:13:23,930
(The noodles are finally here.)

2142
01:13:23,936 --> 01:13:25,300
- Thank you. - Wantanmien.

2143
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:26,970
(The noodles are firm.)

2144
01:13:26,972 --> 01:13:30,170
- There are dumplings inside. - Let's try it.

2145
01:13:30,175 --> 01:13:31,170
(He tries the soup first.)

2146
01:13:31,176 --> 01:13:32,470
It tastes like shrimp, right?

2147
01:13:32,478 --> 01:13:34,410
- It does. - It tastes like shrimp.

2148
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:36,140
There's a strong scent of shrimps.

2149
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:37,540
It tastes like shrimp.

2150
01:13:37,549 --> 01:13:39,510
The soup tastes like shrimp.

2151
01:13:39,518 --> 01:13:41,645
What do you like better?

2152
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,120
This is seafood.

2153
01:13:44,123 --> 01:13:46,020
Let me try the sauce.

2154
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:47,520
What do you like better?

2155
01:13:47,526 --> 01:13:48,720
(The two men try the soup first.)

2156
01:13:48,727 --> 01:13:51,085
It's sour.

2157
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,990
(She inhales the noodles.)

2158
01:13:52,998 --> 01:13:54,130
It's sour.

2159
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:56,460
(This is the textbook way of eating noodles.)

2160
01:13:56,468 --> 01:13:58,470
- It's chewy. - Look.

2161
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,170
- Look. - These are dried noodles.

2162
01:14:01,173 --> 01:14:03,040
- Right. - They're kind of dry.

2163
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:04,370
- How is it? - Look.

2164
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:07,435
(Jae Seok goes after the dumpling.)

2165
01:14:07,579 --> 01:14:08,840
How is the dumpling?

2166
01:14:08,847 --> 01:14:10,210
- Does it taste like shrimp? - Yes.

2167
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:11,945
Does it?

2168
01:14:13,385 --> 01:14:14,750
The shrimp...

2169
01:14:14,753 --> 01:14:16,220
(There's a whole shrimp inside.)

2170
01:14:16,221 --> 01:14:17,915
There's a whole shrimp.

2171
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:20,015
It...

2172
01:14:20,225 --> 01:14:22,590
- tastes good. - The texture is amazing.

2173
01:14:22,594 --> 01:14:23,920
It's a whole shrimp, right?

2174
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:25,930
I didn't know we were going to have noodles first.

2175
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:27,960
Me neither. I had no idea.

2176
01:14:27,966 --> 01:14:30,160
(This was the same in Okinawa.)

2177
01:14:30,169 --> 01:14:32,035
This is our first menu.

2178
01:14:32,304 --> 01:14:35,040
It won't be noodles again, right?

2179
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,800
- No way. - Not again.

2180
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:37,970
It won't be noodles again.

2181
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:40,235
It can't be twice.

2182
01:14:41,914 --> 01:14:43,745
This is good.

2183
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:44,880
You have to drink the soup.

2184
01:14:44,883 --> 01:14:46,550
Seok Jin really likes it.

2185
01:14:46,552 --> 01:14:47,880
That was really good.

2186
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,645
That was good.

2187
01:14:50,222 --> 01:14:52,020
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2188
01:14:52,024 --> 01:14:54,785
(The staff joined late.)

2189
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:58,430
- You'll vote again. - Okay.

2190
01:14:58,430 --> 01:14:59,560
Turn the roulette.

2191
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:00,590
Here we go again.

2192
01:15:00,599 --> 01:15:02,060
Steak please.

2193
01:15:02,067 --> 01:15:04,600
(He hopes it'll be steak this time.)

2194
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:07,435
(The roulette is spinning!)

2195
01:15:07,806 --> 01:15:09,170
(Who will recommend the menu this time?)

2196
01:15:09,174 --> 01:15:11,605
We can't have noodles again.

2197
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:15,140
(A Hong Kong grandma over the age of 70!)

2198
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:18,375
- "A Hong Kong grandma over 70?" - A Hong Kong grandma.

2199
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:21,445
I don't think there'll be anybody over 70 on the streets.

2200
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:23,520
(They're helpless.)

2201
01:15:23,522 --> 01:15:25,120
Over 70...

2202
01:15:25,124 --> 01:15:26,290
It has to be somebody local.

2203
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,760
We have to ask for their age.

2204
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,090
- A local? - Yes, a local.

2205
01:15:30,095 --> 01:15:32,230
- A grandma, right? - There isn't anybody in downtown.

2206
01:15:32,231 --> 01:15:33,960
- They were in the restaurant. - In the restaurant?

2207
01:15:33,966 --> 01:15:35,825
We have to look.

2208
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:37,300
This...

2209
01:15:37,302 --> 01:15:39,065
We're in trouble.

2210
01:15:40,038 --> 01:15:42,535
We're in trouble today.

2211
01:15:42,808 --> 01:15:45,840
Where do we find a grandma over 70?

2212
01:15:45,844 --> 01:15:47,370
There are some grandpas.

2213
01:15:47,379 --> 01:15:49,380
- What about grandmas? - I don't see any.

2214
01:15:49,381 --> 01:15:50,410
Let's take a look.

2215
01:15:50,415 --> 01:15:51,910
(Where are the grandmas?)

2216
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:53,910
There are no grandmas over 70.

2217
01:15:53,919 --> 01:15:55,250
(Are there grandmas?)

2218
01:15:55,254 --> 01:15:56,280
(It's late, so the streets are quiet.)

2219
01:15:56,288 --> 01:15:58,955
Where do we find a grandma over 70?

2220
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:00,850
- What do we do? - This is too...

2221
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:02,220
Oh, gosh.

2222
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:03,960
We're in a foreign country...

2223
01:16:03,962 --> 01:16:06,225
There's a grandma.

2224
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:08,300
(There's a grandma.)

2225
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,960
(They finally find a Hong Kong grandma!)

2226
01:16:10,969 --> 01:16:15,140
- Hello. - Excuse me, but how old are you?

2227
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,470
(They finally meet one.)

2228
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:24,045
(Is she the person they were looking for?)

2229
01:16:24,683 --> 01:16:27,245
- She's 60. - 60.

2230
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:28,520
(Oh, dear.)

2231
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,580
- That was close. - She looked young.

2232
01:16:29,588 --> 01:16:31,050
She did.

2233
01:16:31,056 --> 01:16:32,590
(Thank you for answering.)

2234
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:34,250
We're in trouble.

2235
01:16:34,259 --> 01:16:36,060
We have no time.

2236
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:38,130
Seniors are not outside.

2237
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:39,330
(It's empty.)

2238
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:42,195
There are some grandpas.

2239
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:44,430
- What do we do? - There are no people.

2240
01:16:44,436 --> 01:16:47,695
Why did you pick that one?

2241
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,840
Why did you pick a grandma in her 70s?

2242
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:51,410
- Jae Seok. - Grandmas in their 70s...

2243
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,340
This is starting again.

2244
01:16:53,345 --> 01:16:55,210
- Hey. - It's late,

2245
01:16:55,214 --> 01:16:57,010
and you're getting mad.

2246
01:16:57,015 --> 01:16:58,650
Why did you pick that?

2247
01:16:58,650 --> 01:16:59,680
This is starting again.

2248
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:01,750
- I should have spun it. - Yes, you should have.

2249
01:17:01,753 --> 01:17:04,020
There are no grandmas out right now.

2250
01:17:04,022 --> 01:17:06,220
There are some grandpas.

2251
01:17:06,225 --> 01:17:07,890
Why did you pick that?

2252
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:10,060
You could have picked a convenience store.

2253
01:17:10,062 --> 01:17:11,760
- This is driving me nuts. - Oh, gosh.

2254
01:17:11,763 --> 01:17:13,760
Gosh.

2255
01:17:13,765 --> 01:17:15,865
We're in trouble. There's nobody.

2256
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:17,660
We had to find a Japanese grandma last time too.

2257
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:20,335
(Hold on!)

2258
01:17:21,473 --> 01:17:23,640
- Is she in her 70s? - I don't think so.

2259
01:17:23,642 --> 01:17:26,110
(They see somebody in passing.)

2260
01:17:26,111 --> 01:17:28,380
(Is she the person they were looking for?)

2261
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:30,510
Excuse me.

2262
01:17:30,515 --> 01:17:33,180
(They start talking to her carefully.)

2263
01:17:33,185 --> 01:17:34,580
Is English okay?

2264
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:36,180
Excuse me.

2265
01:17:36,188 --> 01:17:38,685
How old are you?

2266
01:17:39,925 --> 01:17:41,150
- Me? - Yes.

2267
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:43,060
(Me?)

2268
01:17:43,061 --> 01:17:45,430
- 78. - 78?

2269
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,630
(She's 78.)

2270
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:49,600
(They finally found her!)

2271
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:51,330
- She looks so young. - Really?

2272
01:17:51,336 --> 01:17:53,800
(Is she really that age?)

2273
01:17:53,805 --> 01:17:56,470
- You look 60. - Thank you.

2274
01:17:56,475 --> 01:17:58,970
(They found a person over 70.)

2275
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:02,775
(It's time to ask for a recommendation.)

2276
01:18:03,048 --> 01:18:04,750
(Then can we...)

2277
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,715
- Where... - Philippines.

2278
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:09,320
- Philippines? - I see.

2279
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:10,780
Philippines.

2280
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:12,950
- Thank you. - Thank you. Bye.

2281
01:18:12,958 --> 01:18:14,090
(She's not a local, so it doesn't count.)

2282
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:15,720
Can't we ask a Filipino?

2283
01:18:15,727 --> 01:18:17,560
It has to be a Hong Kong grandma.

2284
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:18,560
We found her.

2285
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:20,760
- She looked so young. - I agree.

2286
01:18:20,766 --> 01:18:23,025
I was shocked. I thought we found her.

2287
01:18:23,135 --> 01:18:24,770
Where are we now?

2288
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:27,300
I don't think there will be grandmas here.

2289
01:18:27,306 --> 01:18:29,000
What do we do?

2290
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:30,670
- We're in trouble. - Here.

2291
01:18:30,676 --> 01:18:31,970
- There are grandpas. - There's a grandma.

2292
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:33,570
What?

2293
01:18:33,578 --> 01:18:35,345
- Her? - Can we ask?

2294
01:18:35,547 --> 01:18:36,710
(Is she the person they were looking for?)

2295
01:18:36,715 --> 01:18:38,050
Can we ask?

2296
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,145
Excuse me.

2297
01:18:41,053 --> 01:18:44,750
(The local guide explains the situation and asks for her age.)

2298
01:18:44,756 --> 01:18:47,485
- She's young. - She might be.

2299
01:18:49,094 --> 01:18:51,660
- 73. - 73.

2300
01:18:51,663 --> 01:18:54,260
(They finally found a Hong Kong grandma over 70.)

2301
01:18:54,266 --> 01:18:55,760
(It's for real this time!)

2302
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:57,000
73?

2303
01:18:57,002 --> 01:18:59,100
Can we...

2304
01:18:59,104 --> 01:19:00,770
Can we ask you a question?

2305
01:19:00,772 --> 01:19:03,365
(She's a local, so they can ask for a recommendation.)

2306
01:19:04,509 --> 01:19:07,770
(Well...)

2307
01:19:07,779 --> 01:19:11,650
("Please recommend a menu" in Cantonese)

2308
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,250
(If she recommends steak, the mission is complete.)

2309
01:19:13,251 --> 01:19:16,115
We can't have noodles again.

2310
01:19:16,288 --> 01:19:17,990
Steak please. Steak.

2311
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:19,720
(What will the grandma recommend?)

2312
01:19:19,725 --> 01:19:22,260
- Wantanmien. - Wantanmien?

2313
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,460
Chaomien.

2314
01:19:24,463 --> 01:19:28,560
(What did she just say?)

2315
01:19:28,567 --> 01:19:31,130
There's wantanmien and fried noodles.

2316
01:19:31,136 --> 01:19:33,800
(The local guide translates.)

2317
01:19:33,805 --> 01:19:36,770
(Sorry?)

2318
01:19:36,775 --> 01:19:38,770
(Noodles? What noodles?)

2319
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:40,140
- Fried noodles? - What did she say?

2320
01:19:40,145 --> 01:19:41,945
Fried noodles?

2321
01:19:43,048 --> 01:19:47,180
(When they had it the first time, they thought it wasn't possible.)

2322
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:49,550
(Not again.)

2323
01:19:49,554 --> 01:19:52,020
(They were sure.)

2324
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:53,890
(There's nothing impossible.)

2325
01:19:53,892 --> 01:19:56,560
(It got them.)

2326
01:19:56,561 --> 01:19:57,560
Chaomien?

2327
01:19:57,562 --> 01:19:58,760
(He confirms.)

2328
01:19:58,764 --> 01:20:00,290
- Yes. - Chaomien?

2329
01:20:00,298 --> 01:20:02,430
- Delicious? - Yes.

2330
01:20:02,434 --> 01:20:03,800
Very cheap.

2331
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:05,170
- Very cheap? - Thank you.

2332
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,670
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2333
01:20:06,671 --> 01:20:07,800
(She recommends wantanmien and chaomien highly.)

2334
01:20:07,806 --> 01:20:09,300
Is Hong Kong known for noodles?

2335
01:20:09,307 --> 01:20:11,200
- No. - It's dim sum.

2336
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:13,040
- It's dim sum. - It is, right?

2337
01:20:13,045 --> 01:20:15,810
I'm not even hoping for steak. It's dim sum.

2338
01:20:15,814 --> 01:20:18,075
It's the yellow sign.

2339
01:20:18,483 --> 01:20:20,010
Is this it?

2340
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:21,850
I think this is it.

2341
01:20:21,853 --> 01:20:24,850
- They ran out of ingredients. - What a relief.

2342
01:20:24,856 --> 01:20:27,290
(What? They ran out of ingredients?)

2343
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:29,420
This is great. This worked out.

2344
01:20:29,428 --> 01:20:31,560
- Gosh, I'm relieved. - Goodness.

2345
01:20:31,563 --> 01:20:33,630
- This is great. - We should spin it one more time.

2346
01:20:33,632 --> 01:20:34,760
- Right? We... - We have no choice.

2347
01:20:34,766 --> 01:20:36,360
Hey, didn't he just say...

2348
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,360
he can serve you food?

2349
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:40,030
- Great. We have no choice. - Hey, didn't he just say...

2350
01:20:40,038 --> 01:20:41,170
(He is saying something.)

2351
01:20:41,173 --> 01:20:42,805
He can serve us?

2352
01:20:43,508 --> 01:20:45,410
- He does have noodles there. - Those are egg noodles.

2353
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,340
- It's a paradise for noodles. - Hold on a second.

2354
01:20:47,345 --> 01:20:50,410
(No way. Could it be possible...)

2355
01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:51,550
Come in, come in.

2356
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:53,110
(Bad inklings always come true.)

2357
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:54,110
He has food?

2358
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:55,120
(He said he was out of food.)

2359
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,780
- Come in, come in. - He has food?

2360
01:20:56,788 --> 01:20:57,850
Wait, he just said he couldn't serve us.

2361
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,220
- He said no earlier. - He can serve you food now.

2362
01:20:59,224 --> 01:21:00,220
He ran out of ingredients.

2363
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:02,620
He said he has enough for a bowl. Try his food.

2364
01:21:02,627 --> 01:21:05,660
- Thank you. - What noodles are we eating?

2365
01:21:05,664 --> 01:21:07,560
- It's over there. - Hello.

2366
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:09,565
(They're our last customers.)

2367
01:21:09,634 --> 01:21:12,000
I can eat two bowls of noodles.

2368
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:14,600
- But if we get the noodles again, - Unbelievable.

2369
01:21:14,606 --> 01:21:15,600
I'll feel sick.

2370
01:21:15,607 --> 01:21:18,310
This is... What's going on? Look how this is...

2371
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:19,670
turning out to be. Are we having noodles again?

2372
01:21:19,678 --> 01:21:20,970
Is this Part Two of Along with the Noodles?

2373
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:23,775
(Is this Part 2 of Along with the Noodles?)

2374
01:21:24,516 --> 01:21:27,610
(The deceased will be born again when they eat the steak.)

2375
01:21:27,619 --> 01:21:30,920
(Since you have awful karma, you'll be punished to eat noodles.)

2376
01:21:30,922 --> 01:21:34,220
(The curse of the King of Noodles ever since the Okinawa trip)

2377
01:21:34,226 --> 01:21:36,220
(They had noodles after noodles.)

2378
01:21:36,228 --> 01:21:38,630
(And they had some more noodles.)

2379
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:42,025
(Into the Underworld of Noodles that doesn't get untangled)

2380
01:21:42,234 --> 01:21:45,370
("Part 1 of Along with the Noodles in Okinawa")

2381
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:50,340
("Part 2 of Along with the Noodles in Hong Kong")

2382
01:21:50,342 --> 01:21:52,840
- Wantanmien. - Is this "Along with the Noodles"?

2383
01:21:52,844 --> 01:21:54,510
- The old lady earlier... - Okay.

2384
01:21:54,513 --> 01:21:57,210
recommended either wantanmien or stir-fried noodles.

2385
01:21:57,215 --> 01:21:59,480
- The stir-fried noodles... - They only serve wantanmien here.

2386
01:21:59,484 --> 01:22:00,850
So we'll eat that.

2387
01:22:00,852 --> 01:22:03,380
- We already had one. - We just had the same dish.

2388
01:22:03,388 --> 01:22:05,290
- We just had one there. - All right.

2389
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:07,390
You want us to eat two bowls of that?

2390
01:22:07,392 --> 01:22:09,420
Listen. The old lady...

2391
01:22:09,427 --> 01:22:11,160
- We already had 1 bowl. - 2 bowls?

2392
01:22:11,163 --> 01:22:14,230
I gave up on the steak, but they won't recommend dim sum.

2393
01:22:14,232 --> 01:22:17,830
You know what? I feel as if the nightmare in Okinawa...

2394
01:22:17,836 --> 01:22:20,600
is coming back to me, but with wantanmien this time.

2395
01:22:20,605 --> 01:22:22,540
- Here's my opinion. - No way.

2396
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:27,105
Do you think the staff could have "logged" this?

2397
01:22:27,212 --> 01:22:29,180
- This is weird. - It's not "logged".

2398
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:31,245
- It's "rigged". - "Rigged".

2399
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:33,010
(The second bowl confuses her.)

2400
01:22:33,018 --> 01:22:34,380
The staff "logged" it.

2401
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:35,420
(This incident questions her vocabulary.)

2402
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,920
- You didn't study in school, right? - You really surprised me.

2403
01:22:37,923 --> 01:22:39,220
It's not that.

2404
01:22:39,224 --> 01:22:40,650
I think it's because I'm next to Seok Jin.

2405
01:22:40,659 --> 01:22:42,120
- That can't be right. - Right now...

2406
01:22:42,127 --> 01:22:44,460
You're not as educated as I thought you'd be.

2407
01:22:44,462 --> 01:22:46,990
- You didn't study, did you? - Seriously. I was so shocked.

2408
01:22:46,998 --> 01:22:49,795
- The staff "logged" this? - Seriously.

2409
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:52,470
- You're not that knowledgeable. - Right.

2410
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:55,065
- I can't think straight. - Here's my opinion.

2411
01:22:55,473 --> 01:22:57,300
I'm not sure if we'll get it or not.

2412
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:58,470
We must choose a taxi driver.

2413
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:00,010
- We must leave this neighborhood. - We must leave here.

2414
01:23:00,011 --> 01:23:01,140
- Do you know what I mean? - You're right.

2415
01:23:01,146 --> 01:23:02,910
- In my opinion, - This place only has noodles.

2416
01:23:02,914 --> 01:23:05,080
- this is the wantanmien street. - Every restaurant sells wantanmien.

2417
01:23:05,083 --> 01:23:06,850
We didn't know, but this street is full of wantanmien restaurants.

2418
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:08,850
- I agree. I see it everywhere. - That's why we must leave here.

2419
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:10,250
There are too many wantanmien restaurants.

2420
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:11,620
They'll recommend it if we ask people here.

2421
01:23:11,623 --> 01:23:13,750
- That's right. - That will certainly happen.

2422
01:23:13,758 --> 01:23:18,155
(Clueless of their plan, he's making a delicious bowl of wantanmien.)

2423
01:23:20,932 --> 01:23:23,630
(A mix of shrimp wontons, chewy noodles, and rich broth)

2424
01:23:23,635 --> 01:23:25,230
- Here it comes. - It's coming.

2425
01:23:25,237 --> 01:23:27,035
- It's here. - Wantanmien.

2426
01:23:27,672 --> 01:23:28,940
(Here are our last two bowls of wantanmien.)

2427
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,705
- The portion is a lot. - Thank you.

2428
01:23:30,842 --> 01:23:33,470
- Thank you. It's the same. - It's exactly the same.

2429
01:23:33,478 --> 01:23:34,470
(This soup and the previous soup are the same.)

2430
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:36,745
They put the same wontons here.

2431
01:23:37,515 --> 01:23:39,075
It's identical.

2432
01:23:39,684 --> 01:23:40,710
(Feeling dizzy)

2433
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,050
Since we're here,

2434
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:45,550
we'll compare this one to the previous one.

2435
01:23:45,557 --> 01:23:47,650
(He's eating wantanmien again?)

2436
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:49,160
- I'll compare to the first one. - This is...

2437
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,420
(- This is his second bowl. - How does the second one taste?)

2438
01:23:51,429 --> 01:23:52,930
(Where is that restaurant?)

2439
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:56,130
What is this? This is just like that time in Okinawa.

2440
01:23:56,134 --> 01:23:57,330
(How does the second wonton soup taste?)

2441
01:23:57,335 --> 01:23:58,470
How does the broth taste?

2442
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,300
(- Seok Jin is there too! - He's eating that again?)

2443
01:24:00,305 --> 01:24:01,770
(- Is it good? - Hey, So Min is there too!)

2444
01:24:01,773 --> 01:24:03,800
(Thinking back...)

2445
01:24:03,808 --> 01:24:05,840
It tastes similar.

2446
01:24:05,844 --> 01:24:07,340
(It's the same.)

2447
01:24:07,345 --> 01:24:09,340
It's similar to the one before. I'm serious.

2448
01:24:09,347 --> 01:24:10,380
(Try it.)

2449
01:24:10,382 --> 01:24:14,210
The first one had a strong aroma of the shrimps.

2450
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:16,020
- This one has a weaker aroma. - You're right.

2451
01:24:16,021 --> 01:24:18,250
This is milder.

2452
01:24:18,256 --> 01:24:21,220
- It tastes like shrimps too. - It tastes just the same.

2453
01:24:21,226 --> 01:24:23,560
So Min.

2454
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:25,960
- You'd better eat noodles. Or else. - It tastes just the same.

2455
01:24:25,964 --> 01:24:28,430
It tastes just like shrimps too. It has the same flavor.

2456
01:24:28,433 --> 01:24:30,460
- This... - I guess people in Hong Kong...

2457
01:24:30,468 --> 01:24:32,270
must really like wantanmien.

2458
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:35,335
Let me try the wonton in the soup.

2459
01:24:35,674 --> 01:24:36,770
- It's good. - This is good.

2460
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:39,840
- This is good. Isn't it good? - Yes, this is so springy.

2461
01:24:39,844 --> 01:24:42,410
(The previous one was delicious.)

2462
01:24:42,414 --> 01:24:47,550
(And this restaurant's wantanmien is great too.)

2463
01:24:47,552 --> 01:24:49,485
Their shrimp wontons are bigger.

2464
01:24:50,021 --> 01:24:52,285
But is there kimchi?

2465
01:24:53,124 --> 01:24:54,650
(Can you give us some side dishes?)

2466
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:56,360
- Is there sauce? - Do they...

2467
01:24:56,361 --> 01:24:57,590
Hi. Excuse me.

2468
01:24:57,595 --> 01:24:59,960
- It's very delicious. - Thank you.

2469
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:03,230
Do people from Hong Kong like noodles?

2470
01:25:03,234 --> 01:25:04,360
- Do they like noodles? - Yes.

2471
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:06,330
Do a lot of people from Hong Kong like noodles?

2472
01:25:06,338 --> 01:25:08,130
Yes, they like noodles very much.

2473
01:25:08,139 --> 01:25:09,370
They just like noodles.

2474
01:25:09,374 --> 01:25:10,935
(That must be it, right?)

2475
01:25:11,376 --> 01:25:13,370
Excuse me. Excuse me.

2476
01:25:13,378 --> 01:25:14,370
(They ask her their 2nd question.)

2477
01:25:14,379 --> 01:25:17,840
Do you like steak?

2478
01:25:17,849 --> 01:25:19,310
- Steak? - Steak?

2479
01:25:19,317 --> 01:25:20,350
- Do you like it? - Beef?

2480
01:25:20,352 --> 01:25:22,120
- Do you like it? - Yes, I like it.

2481
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,190
I like both steak and noodles.

2482
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,220
Beef. I see.

2483
01:25:26,224 --> 01:25:27,420
(She likes both steak and noodles.)

2484
01:25:27,425 --> 01:25:30,285
- You know what? - We still have a shot.

2485
01:25:30,462 --> 01:25:32,330
- What if you get noodles again? - Let's bring it in.

2486
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,630
- Let's do this. - 1, 2, 3.

2487
01:25:34,632 --> 01:25:36,600
Even if we don't get a steak...

2488
01:25:36,601 --> 01:25:38,130
- Let's at least get dim sum. - Something else like dim sum.

2489
01:25:38,136 --> 01:25:40,030
- We should get dim sum... - Dim sum or...

2490
01:25:40,038 --> 01:25:42,040
- Or bubble tea for desserts. - Desserts.

2491
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,270
- That sounds good. - Yes. Okay.

2492
01:25:43,274 --> 01:25:44,470
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2493
01:25:44,476 --> 01:25:45,470
- We can do this. - We can do this.

2494
01:25:45,477 --> 01:25:47,510
(They're fine as long as it's not noodles. Good luck!)

2495
01:25:47,512 --> 01:25:49,340
- We won't get noodles again. - Right.

2496
01:25:49,347 --> 01:25:51,380
- Let's go. - Let's spin and go.

2497
01:25:51,383 --> 01:25:54,080
- Let me spin it. - We have to get out of this area.

2498
01:25:54,085 --> 01:25:56,220
- I want a taxi driver. - We should get a taxi driver.

2499
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:57,280
(Getting a taxi driver is the best to get out of there.)

2500
01:25:57,288 --> 01:25:58,720
- I'll spin it. - All right.

2501
01:25:58,723 --> 01:26:01,285
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2502
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,660
Get the taxi driver. The taxi driver.

2503
01:26:04,662 --> 01:26:07,590
(Please let it be the taxi driver.)

2504
01:26:07,599 --> 01:26:08,830
Please be the taxi driver.

2505
01:26:08,833 --> 01:26:11,930
(Amazing! They get the taxi driver.)

2506
01:26:11,936 --> 01:26:14,430
- Bravo! Bravo. - We got it. It's the taxi driver.

2507
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:16,470
- We did it. - We're good at spinning this.

2508
01:26:16,474 --> 01:26:18,300
(They must get on the taxi, move far, and get a recommendation.)

2509
01:26:18,309 --> 01:26:19,310
They all recommend...

2510
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:21,705
- Let's at least get something good. - Let's get out of here.

2511
01:26:22,046 --> 01:26:24,210
(After finishing two bowls of wantanmien...)

2512
01:26:24,215 --> 01:26:25,775
Gosh, noodles.

2513
01:26:25,984 --> 01:26:27,615
I want to stop eating noodles.

2514
01:26:27,685 --> 01:26:29,880
- Let's go. - I'm dizzy after having two bowls.

2515
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,120
- If we get noodles again... - We would be in pure torment.

2516
01:26:32,123 --> 01:26:33,785
(Can they avoid the underworld of noodles?)

2517
01:26:34,359 --> 01:26:35,420
Okay.

2518
01:26:35,427 --> 01:26:36,420
Hi.

2519
01:26:36,428 --> 01:26:37,460
(They stop a taxi, their savior.)

2520
01:26:37,462 --> 01:26:40,795
- Excuse me. - You got the taxi.

2521
01:26:41,065 --> 01:26:42,330
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2522
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:43,360
My gosh.

2523
01:26:43,368 --> 01:26:44,930
Okay, let's get out of here.

2524
01:26:44,936 --> 01:26:47,030
- We should get out of here. - Out of the wonton street.

2525
01:26:47,038 --> 01:26:48,030
Okay.

2526
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:49,300
(Step 1: Leave the wonton street.)

2527
01:26:49,307 --> 01:26:52,170
We should leave here for now.

2528
01:26:52,177 --> 01:26:53,510
- Let's go. - We should just leave here for now?

2529
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:56,010
- Let's just go. - What does that even mean?

2530
01:26:56,014 --> 01:26:58,380
Yes, just go. Go.

2531
01:26:58,383 --> 01:26:59,710
Please drive away.

2532
01:26:59,717 --> 01:27:01,110
We have to leave this neighborhood.

2533
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:02,320
Let's get out of here.

2534
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,220
(They escape from the wonton street.)

2535
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:05,290
- Let's go. - Not to come back here,

2536
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,290
please go as far as you can.

2537
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:09,560
- Just go, please. - As far as we can go.

2538
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:11,320
- Just go. - "Just go"?

2539
01:27:11,329 --> 01:27:12,830
- What are you saying? - Just go.

2540
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:14,495
I'm asking him to just drive.

2541
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:16,630
(After they escape the alley...)

2542
01:27:16,634 --> 01:27:18,695
So Min, we should talk to him now.

2543
01:27:18,937 --> 01:27:20,565
Please.

2544
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:23,240
(Let me see.)

2545
01:27:23,241 --> 01:27:25,540
Anywhere. Pick any dish.

2546
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:27,210
- Pick the dish you like. - Yes.

2547
01:27:27,212 --> 01:27:28,370
Anywhere. Any dish.

2548
01:27:28,379 --> 01:27:30,480
Please pick the best dish.

2549
01:27:30,482 --> 01:27:32,010
(Hold on.)

2550
01:27:32,016 --> 01:27:33,210
It's your choice.

2551
01:27:33,218 --> 01:27:35,220
- Just one dish. - We were on this road earlier.

2552
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,885
It won't be a problem.

2553
01:27:37,088 --> 01:27:38,920
Please pick the best dish you like.

2554
01:27:38,923 --> 01:27:40,450
- Hey, he shouldn't go this way. - Wait.

2555
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,290
- No, no. Wait. - Hold on.

2556
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:45,260
- Jae Seok, wait. - Hold on a second.

2557
01:27:45,263 --> 01:27:47,130
- Look at the map. - A good dish.

2558
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:49,500
- Hey, he shouldn't go this way. - Wait.

2559
01:27:49,501 --> 01:27:50,560
Hold on.

2560
01:27:50,568 --> 01:27:52,470
- Jae Seok, wait. - Hold on a second.

2561
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:53,800
Where are we going? Hold on.

2562
01:27:53,805 --> 01:27:55,540
- We were just here. - Just go.

2563
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:58,040
Hey, we were just here a while ago. Hey, we were here earlier.

2564
01:27:58,042 --> 01:27:59,910
- Hey, isn't it the same street? - It's the same street.

2565
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:01,510
Hey, it's the same street.

2566
01:28:01,513 --> 01:28:02,640
(I'll recommend this restaurant.)

2567
01:28:02,647 --> 01:28:04,640
- What? - Okay. Here.

2568
01:28:04,649 --> 01:28:06,180
- Here? - We were just there.

2569
01:28:06,184 --> 01:28:09,185
(He recommends the same wantanmien restaurant.)

2570
01:28:09,554 --> 01:28:13,620
(They barely managed to get out by asking him to just drive.)

2571
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:17,225
(They came back after going around.)

2572
01:28:18,096 --> 01:28:20,760
- Okay. Thank you. - It's the same restaurant.

2573
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:23,325
- Let's get off. Get off! - Hey, this is...

2574
01:28:23,434 --> 01:28:25,060
They ran out of food.

2575
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:26,570
Hold on. It's the same restaurant.

2576
01:28:26,571 --> 01:28:28,100
Here? Here?

2577
01:28:28,106 --> 01:28:30,035
- Here? - Here?

2578
01:28:30,174 --> 01:28:31,735
Here?

2579
01:28:31,843 --> 01:28:33,605
I can't believe this.

2580
01:28:34,212 --> 01:28:36,040
(I get that this restaurant is great, but...)

2581
01:28:36,047 --> 01:28:37,910
- I mean... - Hold on.

2582
01:28:37,916 --> 01:28:39,875
- Wait. - Should I get off?

2583
01:28:39,918 --> 01:28:41,550
- Wait, this is... - Wait.

2584
01:28:41,553 --> 01:28:42,720
(Please stop telling us how great this restaurant is.)

2585
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,120
- I can't believe this. - Jae Seok.

2586
01:28:44,122 --> 01:28:45,120
- We should've gone farther. - How is this possible?

2587
01:28:45,123 --> 01:28:46,720
- He said the restaurant was here. - Listen.

2588
01:28:46,724 --> 01:28:48,920
- I think there's an evil spirit. - This is crazy.

2589
01:28:48,927 --> 01:28:51,260
- How can it happen again? - This is like the Mobius strip.

2590
01:28:51,262 --> 01:28:53,460
(Is this Mobius strip continuing from Okinawa?)

2591
01:28:53,464 --> 01:28:57,330
(They went to the same restaurant twice even in Okinawa.)

2592
01:28:57,335 --> 01:28:58,330
How could we come back here?

2593
01:28:58,336 --> 01:29:00,600
(Just like the trip in Okinawa,)

2594
01:29:00,605 --> 01:29:03,000
(it happens again in Hong Kong.)

2595
01:29:03,007 --> 01:29:06,670
(The curse of the noodles repeats exactly the same.)

2596
01:29:06,678 --> 01:29:07,710
It's the same restaurant.

2597
01:29:07,712 --> 01:29:10,340
(Why can't we get out of this neighborhood?)

2598
01:29:10,348 --> 01:29:12,680
(They tried to get out, but their effort was futile.)

2599
01:29:12,684 --> 01:29:16,585
(They're locked in the wonton street, the curse of noodles.)

2600
01:29:16,721 --> 01:29:21,115
(What will happen to Team Hong Kong who returns to the same place?)

2601
01:29:21,392 --> 01:29:23,120
(They thought things would be different at another area.)

2602
01:29:23,127 --> 01:29:25,730
(We must get out of this area now.)

2603
01:29:25,730 --> 01:29:27,790
(However,)

2604
01:29:27,799 --> 01:29:31,260
(they face another confusion at a new place.)

2605
01:29:31,269 --> 01:29:34,995
(The swamp in Hong Kong hasn't ended.)

2606
01:29:35,807 --> 01:29:39,235
(Will they be able to come back safely?)

2607
01:29:39,611 --> 01:29:41,710
(You're working. Where are you going?)

2608
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:44,040
(No one can escape this.)

2609
01:29:44,048 --> 01:29:46,880
(Everything will end if they gather a total of 100 people.)

2610
01:29:46,884 --> 01:29:48,475
Were you talking about me?

2611
01:29:48,553 --> 01:29:52,020
(Suspicious movements are spotted all over the place.)

2612
01:29:52,023 --> 01:29:54,985
(Will they be able to accomplish their mission?)

2613
01:29:55,727 --> 01:29:58,660
(Their struggle with Mother Nature has finally begun in full-force.)

2614
01:29:58,663 --> 01:30:03,895
(Team Si Young must complete their mission in the wild.)

2615
01:30:04,669 --> 01:30:08,735
(The last mission awaits them.)

2616
01:30:08,973 --> 01:30:11,170
(The war of ballots unfolds on the boat.)

2617
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:13,840
(What has happened on their boat?)

2618
01:30:13,845 --> 01:30:15,010
What is this?

2619
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:18,275
(Year End Special, Part Two of Once Again Even If You Hate It)
