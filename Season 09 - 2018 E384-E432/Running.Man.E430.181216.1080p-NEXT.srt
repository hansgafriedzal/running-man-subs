1
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:08,965
(Last week)

2
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:11,410
(Year End Special with Si Young, a special team leader)

3
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,105
(Try the missions the members failed once again!)

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:17,275
(Each team chose their mission after thinking hard about it.)

5
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:20,550
(Team Si Young got the mission to gather 4L of sheep milk.)

6
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:24,215
(After many hardships, they finally got a ranch to agree.)

7
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:27,860
(They arrive in Wangsan-myeon, Gangwon Province for the mission.)

8
00:00:27,864 --> 00:00:29,490
You can get in the passenger seat in the front.

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:30,995
(They arrive in Wangsan-myeon, Gangwon Province for the mission.)

10
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,600
(They can complete their mission after milking 4L of sheep milk.)

11
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:34,370
Not yet.

12
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:36,970
This will be a long and hard trip.

13
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:41,070
(The owner of the ranch says something insightful.)

14
00:00:41,077 --> 00:00:42,510
A long trip?

15
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:43,840
(They set out on a long and hard trip to the ranch.)

16
00:00:43,847 --> 00:00:44,840
Are you all right?

17
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:46,335
(They set out on a long and hard trip to the ranch.)

18
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:47,480
(They must pass through a brook.)

19
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:50,120
- It is quite rugged. - We're passing through a brook.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,845
- That's the ranch you mentioned. - I see.

21
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:55,190
My sheep are outside over there.

22
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:56,720
- They are out? - Really?

23
00:00:56,726 --> 00:00:58,490
- I can see them. - There they are.

24
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,490
(I fooled you, didn't I?)

25
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:01,360
- You're right. Seriously. - It is in the woods.

26
00:01:01,364 --> 00:01:04,225
- I do see the ranch. - Even the puppy is so cute.

27
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,860
The ranch is bigger than I thought.

28
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,300
(A home for the puppy and sheep)

29
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,570
- Shake it? - If you shake it,

30
00:01:09,572 --> 00:01:11,070
they come to eat it.

31
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:13,340
Hello, girls.

32
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,070
Do you want to see it?

33
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,470
This one is big.

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,505
- They're eating it. - I can just shake it.

35
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,250
She's eating a lot of mine.

36
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,380
(Munching)

37
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:25,415
(Dashing away suddenly)

38
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:28,685
Hey, baby. Baby.

39
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,585
It's so quick.

40
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:34,055
- Hello. My gosh. - Aren't they running away?

41
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:36,030
- Byul. - This...

42
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:37,030
(They can't even try their mission.)

43
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:39,095
I think this will be a bust.

44
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,870
(He tries to ring the bell to call the sheep.)

45
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,795
(Ringing)

46
00:01:43,139 --> 00:01:44,870
(Can the bell get the sheep to come back?)

47
00:01:44,874 --> 00:01:46,100
Your dad rang the bell.

48
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,210
They're responding to it. They're coming down.

49
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,880
(Rushing back)

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,680
This is so fascinating.

51
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,645
Haha, shouldn't we stay away? Shouldn't we?

52
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:58,580
- They're fast. They came down fast. - This is fascinating.

53
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:59,850
This is so fascinating.

54
00:01:59,856 --> 00:02:01,090
Everyone, come back in.

55
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,885
(There are no more guests, right?)

56
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,160
(Coming in after hearing the bell)

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,390
- Come inside. - My gosh.

58
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:09,160
- Close the door. - Get the door behind you.

59
00:02:09,165 --> 00:02:11,160
Come inside. Come in.

60
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:13,870
(They hesitate at the door.)

61
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,470
- Come inside, everyone. - They feel something is off.

62
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:17,500
Go to the back, and drive them inside.

63
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:18,970
Come in.

64
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,870
- Come in, babies. - Hey, come in.

65
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:23,040
- Let's go. Come this way. - Let's go inside.

66
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,080
(They try to drive the sheep inside.)

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,440
- Let's go in. This way, girls. - Come in.

68
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:28,480
Let's go to where your daddy is.

69
00:02:28,485 --> 00:02:29,850
- To where your dad is. - Go inside.

70
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,450
- No, no. Please. No. - Gosh.

71
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:34,190
(They run away for the 2nd time.)

72
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,650
Don't go there.

73
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:36,820
(Team Si Young is in a crisis.)

74
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,120
What are we going to do?

75
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,955
(The sheep run away farther this time.)

76
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:43,660
(The bell rings again.)

77
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:44,830
(They need a plan as they can't film it.)

78
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:47,330
- Everyone. - He keeps ringing. What must we do?

79
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:49,830
We should get the sheep inside without the cameras...

80
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,470
- and start filming them. - We will turn off...

81
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:54,470
- the lights and get them in. - We'll get the sheep first.

82
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:55,470
Let's try that. They won't go in.

83
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,940
We should get rid of the cameras first.

84
00:02:57,947 --> 00:03:00,675
- Should we stay away? - You should stay here.

85
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:05,815
(Sheep don't move at night. They must start before the sunset.)

86
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:10,045
(Unlike the previous time, they don't come back at the bell.)

87
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,760
- I think we're doomed. - Right.

88
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:15,485
What should we do?

89
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,360
They went all the way up there.

90
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,855
(They stay still at a deeper point.)

91
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:21,730
Come on in.

92
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:26,370
(The owner is getting anxious.)

93
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:30,040
(Team Si Young is even more anxious.)

94
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,040
(The sun will set soon.)

95
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,635
Everyone.

96
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,880
(Look over there.)

97
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,075
They're coming down. They're coming down. It's our last chance.

98
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:39,550
Hey.

99
00:03:39,556 --> 00:03:42,490
(They run down the mountain at full speed.)

100
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:43,660
It's over if we don't get them now.

101
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,960
(This might be their last chance.)

102
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:47,390
If we don't get them this time, we'll fail this mission.

103
00:03:47,397 --> 00:03:49,290
(There you go. Come inside.)

104
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,360
Go out of there. Go.

105
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,495
There they come.

106
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:57,100
(Come back into the house just like that.)

107
00:03:57,106 --> 00:04:01,070
(There are no strangers, right? Shall we go inside?)

108
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:04,140
(They approach all the way to the door.)

109
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,635
(However...)

110
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,075
(They stop at the door again. It still must feel unfamiliar.)

111
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:11,720
Turn off the lights.

112
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,575
(I think they're scared.)

113
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:18,415
(They turn off the last light along with the rest of the lights.)

114
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,660
What should we do?

115
00:04:19,662 --> 00:04:20,660
(After observing the scene...)

116
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,025
They're going back. What are we going to do?

117
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:27,425
(They run away for the 3rd time despite their efforts.)

118
00:04:27,437 --> 00:04:29,195
Sir, they're doing back up.

119
00:04:29,205 --> 00:04:30,735
Babies.

120
00:04:30,773 --> 00:04:31,770
Babies.

121
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,635
(Even his gentle calling doesn't work.)

122
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:36,240
Babies, come inside.

123
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,380
(The sheep full of milk goes to the mountain.)

124
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
Byul!

125
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:41,110
(She runs away to a deep part of the mountain in the darkness.)

126
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:42,610
I think they're scared of the cameras.

127
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,920
- Exactly. We should hide. - We won't disturb them.

128
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,850
- Turn off all the lights. - Okay.

129
00:04:46,856 --> 00:04:49,845
Let's turn off all the lights and head over there.

130
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,120
Babies.

131
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,525
(The owner will ring the bell alone in the ranch.)

132
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,760
(They go into deeper hiding soon.)

133
00:04:56,766 --> 00:05:00,995
I think this might take longer than the mission in Hong Kong.

134
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,370
Don't you think? We didn't even start yet.

135
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:05,140
Come inside. Let's eat.

136
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,240
(They can only wait from afar.)

137
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:07,240
Come here.

138
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:08,670
(They can only wait from afar.)

139
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:10,510
(The trip here was long and hard.)

140
00:05:10,513 --> 00:05:12,610
Come inside. Let's eat. Come here.

141
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:14,080
(But we won't be able to try our mission even once?)

142
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,350
Babies, come here.

143
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:16,350
(Glancing)

144
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,550
They're coming down again.

145
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:19,950
(This is the last chance. The sheep are coming down again!)

146
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:21,885
- Stay still. - They're coming down.

147
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:24,460
They're going in.

148
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,315
(A few of them enter the ranch.)

149
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,255
Don't go there yet.

150
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,160
Wait. Wait for the right time.

151
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:32,795
Come back in.

152
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,670
Let's eat. Come in. Come inside.

153
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:38,165
Come in here. Where are you going again?

154
00:05:38,474 --> 00:05:41,440
(They head back outside since something still feels off.)

155
00:05:41,444 --> 00:05:42,770
Babies.

156
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,080
(Oh, no. They're out again. I thought they were going in.)

157
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:47,150
- Hold on. - Why are they out again?

158
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,405
- They're looking at us. Don't look. - My goodness.

159
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,215
- Really? - All of them are out.

160
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,815
Everyone is out.

161
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,750
I have a bad feeling about this.

162
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,960
(This must be our last chance. I have a bad feeling about this.)

163
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,455
- Please go back in. - Babies.

164
00:06:01,598 --> 00:06:02,960
- All of them are out. - Yes.

165
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:04,525
Come back in.

166
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,925
If they run away again... One of them is going in.

167
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,470
- They're going in. - They went in.

168
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:10,940
- They're going inside. - We can't lower our guard yet.

169
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,500
Go inside. Go, go inside.

170
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:15,210
- I think all of them went in. - All of them went in.

171
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,675
(It's packed.)

172
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:19,840
It's done.

173
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:21,780
He said it's done. It's done.

174
00:06:21,784 --> 00:06:25,450
Come inside. You can turn on the lights if you need to.

175
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:26,450
(There's no time to hesitate.)

176
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,350
- Young Goo. - You should go away. Go that way.

177
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,785
I'm sure the sheep are very startled.

178
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,525
- That's all right, girls. - Hello, there.

179
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,370
Ari, you're so cool. Your beard is really cool too.

180
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:46,535
Try this, Ari.

181
00:06:46,976 --> 00:06:49,105
(Who is this man?)

182
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:50,980
(It won't work on her.)

183
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,580
Hey, girls. Byul.

184
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:54,580
(Si Young tries to talk to Byul.)

185
00:06:54,584 --> 00:06:57,105
You're so pretty, Byul.

186
00:06:57,153 --> 00:07:00,075
- You're eating a lot. - Don't be scared.

187
00:07:00,123 --> 00:07:01,885
Can I pet her?

188
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:05,355
- Can I pet her, sir? - Yes, pet her gently.

189
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:06,960
- Gently. - You must approach gently.

190
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,630
When they know you're safe, they are relieved.

191
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:10,730
Here.

192
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,300
- Byul, do you want to eat this? - Here.

193
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,025
(I feel pretty comfortable around this guy.)

194
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:18,235
She feels at ease with you. Now, you do a headlock on her.

195
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,140
(We've just gotten close.)

196
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,870
That was sudden.

197
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,780
- I have to do that on her? - Yes.

198
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,110
When you do it, pretend you're playing, and someone must feed her.

199
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:29,680
One of you must milk her.

200
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,820
Then one of us can do the headlock. Another one will feed her.

201
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,450
- And the other one will milk her. - Right.

202
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,920
- You can milk these 2 sheep. - These 2?

203
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:38,060
- These two. - Who?

204
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,220
- Her and her. - These two here.

205
00:07:39,228 --> 00:07:42,230
If you milk these 2, you can fill up 5 bottles.

206
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:43,660
- Where is Al Tu? - Here.

207
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,300
- I should get her. - Al Tu.

208
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:47,770
- You got to know her earlier. - Try this. It's fine.

209
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,465
(What are these guests doing?)

210
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,470
(Haha will feed her, Kwang Soo will hold her neck,)

211
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,570
(and Si Young will milk her.)

212
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,065
Let's eat.

213
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,480
- Wait, hold on. She bites. - Feed her. Haha.

214
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
- Okay, okay. - She has to eat.

215
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,950
- Should I try milking her? - Okay.

216
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,750
I'll wipe it for you.

217
00:08:02,752 --> 00:08:05,180
- All right. - Should I get the bottle?

218
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:06,720
- I brought it here. - Hurry.

219
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:08,590
- Feed her more. - Milking her from the back is...

220
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,390
- easier than from the sides. - From the back?

221
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:11,955
(Switching her places)

222
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:13,120
- From the back. - Here you go.

223
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:15,460
- It stings. It sings. - Hold on.

224
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:18,260
- Wait, hold on. She bites me now. - Hold on.

225
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:22,425
Hold on. She's on top of me. She's on top of me.

226
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,970
(It's true. The sheep settles down on Kwang Soo's knee.)

227
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:28,270
(As everyone struggles, they kick up a ruckus.)

228
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:29,770
My knee.

229
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,040
Hold her. Hold her. Wait a second.

230
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:33,535
(She escapes furiously.)

231
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:34,680
(Their first attempt is a big failure.)

232
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:36,680
I had it in my hand.

233
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:38,180
(She really bit me.)

234
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:41,290
- People can't withstand her power. - Of course, not.

235
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,550
She's as powerful as an ox. Seriously.

236
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,255
(You will have to use every ounce of your energy.)

237
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:48,260
(They try for the 2nd time.)

238
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,255
Al Tu.

239
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm not here to bother you. I mean it.

240
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:56,270
Byul. I'm not bothering you. I'm serious.

241
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:57,970
Hey, I was born in the Year of Sheep.

242
00:08:57,974 --> 00:09:00,740
Byul.

243
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:02,735
(Byul stays still as if she understood Si Young.)

244
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,310
Byul.

245
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,235
(Come and milk me already.)

246
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,350
Can we get some food for her?

247
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,350
(Kwang Soo calmly embraces the sheep unlike his first try.)

248
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:11,220
Try not to scare Byul.

249
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,680
- Haha, feed her from the front. - Okay.

250
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:13,990
(Haha and Si Young take their places.)

251
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,620
All right, Byul. Eat this. Let's eat.

252
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,120
(My wife's name is Byul too. Let's eat, Byul.)

253
00:09:18,127 --> 00:09:19,320
This is how you do it.

254
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,460
(Let me demonstrate.)

255
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:21,830
You grabbed it, right?

256
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:24,300
(Dripping)

257
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,830
- Great job. - Is it coming out?

258
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:26,930
Yes.

259
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:27,970
Yes, it's coming out.

260
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,495
(Luckily, the sheep milk is coming out.)

261
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,700
- You can eat this. - This won't take long.

262
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:35,070
You can eat this.

263
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,110
Gosh, it smells savory. It smells like milk.

264
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:41,705
That's right. You're getting a hang of it now.

265
00:09:41,784 --> 00:09:43,210
(Doing her best)

266
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:45,320
I filled up a bottle. I filled it up.

267
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:47,220
(She successfully fills up 1L out of 4L.)

268
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,815
- Okay, hand it over, please. - My gosh.

269
00:09:50,326 --> 00:09:51,460
(The bottle is warm.)

270
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,115
Gosh, it's really warm.

271
00:09:55,164 --> 00:09:57,500
Byul is feeling comfortable now. She's not moving anymore.

272
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,525
- Her body feels light after this. - I see.

273
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:02,930
Holding a bottle of this is heavy.

274
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:05,300
- Imagine carrying it on your back. - Imagine you have to...

275
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:06,900
- carry 4 to 5 bottles. - Exactly.

276
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,010
- We have to milk them then. - Right.

277
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:12,110
Their bodies get lighter. It feels good for them too.

278
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:13,310
Their bodies feel light.

279
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:14,650
(Gushing out)

280
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,975
It's coming out so easily. It won't take long now.

281
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:21,845
Gosh, Si Young. Our team leader is awesome.

282
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:24,490
(This is nothing.)

283
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:27,020
(With her soft touches, she milks the sheep without hesitation.)

284
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,490
Byul, I'm almost done.

285
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,900
- Okay. - Massage it.

286
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,630
- Haha, do we have one more bottle? - Okay, here you go.

287
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,325
Did you finish already?

288
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:37,400
(He's scared of the tail and spills the milk.)

289
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,995
She startled me.

290
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:43,470
(This is the skill of a national athlete.)

291
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:47,945
(Si Young quickly fills up 3L of sheep milk.)

292
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:49,950
- Byul, I'll milk a different one. - Gosh, seriously.

293
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:51,550
- It smells really savory. - I'll get one from the other side.

294
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,815
- I'll milk one from the other side. - It's all right.

295
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,885
Seriously. Mothers are amazing.

296
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:59,290
You can fill up two bottles of sheep milk...

297
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:00,860
- from just one udder. - Right.

298
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:03,430
- I'm tearing up now. - You can milk more than that.

299
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:06,130
(Byul starts dozing off while getting milked)

300
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:08,330
- Sir, I think she's sleepy. - Pardon?

301
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:10,070
- I think she's sleepy. - I guess you have soft hands.

302
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:12,400
- She's closing her eyes. - She feels comfortable.

303
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,535
She's blinking her eyes slowly. She must be sleepy.

304
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,035
It'd be nice if she could fill up all the bottles.

305
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:19,805
This is your last bottle.

306
00:11:20,216 --> 00:11:22,775
(At that time, she cries.)

307
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:25,520
(Did she try to speak her first line?)

308
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:27,345
I think she just thanked her, right?

309
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:29,990
It sounded like, "Thank you."

310
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:32,160
(He translates it very liberally.)

311
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,560
"Gosh, it feels nice."

312
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:34,730
"Thank you."

313
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,960
You're welcome.

314
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:37,585
(Did he learn the sheep language?)

315
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:42,065
(They accomplish their mission by gathering 4L of sheep milk.)

316
00:11:42,238 --> 00:11:45,400
(Thank you. I feel like I can fly as my body feels light.)

317
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:47,610
You successfully gathered 4L of sheep milk.

318
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,010
(Team Si Young accomplishes their first mission.)

319
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,210
- This is so touching. - It's so warm.

320
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,640
- I can't smile. - It feels weird.

321
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:55,680
I would like to give this glory to Byul.

322
00:11:55,685 --> 00:11:57,950
Thanks to you, we got to experience something so special.

323
00:11:57,954 --> 00:11:59,620
- Thank you. - Good job.

324
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:00,750
- Thank you. - Thank you.

325
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,190
- Great job. - Thank you.

326
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:05,020
We'll give you a chance to select your next mission.

327
00:12:05,027 --> 00:12:07,730
Since none of the teams completed their mission...

328
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,355
Really?

329
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:13,000
That is why you will have three choices to pick from.

330
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:15,400
(They can pick the mission they want out of 3 remaining missions.)

331
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,300
(Trying the most recent hairstyles in Osaka)

332
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:19,270
(Fishing king crabs along with 10 types of fish in Russia)

333
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,170
(Catching the fish you tasted at a restaurant on Tsushima Island)

334
00:12:21,177 --> 00:12:22,570
As for this one,

335
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:24,310
can you two do this?

336
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:25,310
(Can you do the Osaka mission?)

337
00:12:25,314 --> 00:12:28,345
- Actually, I... - The Chinese queue is trending.

338
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,450
As for me,

339
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:33,020
until I finish filming the movie, I cannot cut my back hair.

340
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:34,250
Is that so?

341
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:36,820
I'm shooting a drama right now.

342
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:38,460
As for me, next month,

343
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,290
I am to get the dreadlocks again.

344
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,660
- Let's give that back. - We will...

345
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:43,955
- exclude this one. - Sure, sure.

346
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:46,995
This won't work.

347
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:49,870
We went to Russia and came back after a crushing failure.

348
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,670
We couldn't do this even in Russia.

349
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:52,700
What's the next one?

350
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,170
- Let's look at the next one. - Goodness, this.

351
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:56,410
- "Catching fish you tasted"? - We tried this mission.

352
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:58,805
- We did it with Sang Yeob. - Right, right.

353
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:03,210
(When the staff gave them a generous meal, they ate it up.)

354
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:08,090
(But their gluttony led to a complete failure of the mission.)

355
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,450
By the way, it's the fish we will taste.

356
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,560
We don't have to eat them.

357
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:13,960
- In that case, - Exactly.

358
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:16,630
we don't have to eat the assorted sashimi.

359
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,930
(Everyone uses their brain capacity to the fullest at times like this.)

360
00:13:18,934 --> 00:13:20,870
- Exactly. We won't eat that. - We should just avoid that.

361
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,730
- Isn't this doable then? - I agree.

362
00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:24,565
- The side dishes are the tastiest. - Right.

363
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:26,640
- I love the corns with cheese. - I love it.

364
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,440
- That's my favorite. - Corns with cheese.

365
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:30,440
- We'll pick Tsushima Island. - We'll settle on Tsushima Island.

366
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:32,380
- 1, 2, 3. Tsushima Island. - We've decided.

367
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:35,575
- We'll head to a sashimi place. - Okay.

368
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:37,720
- We'll go to a sashimi place. - We'll reveal the mission there.

369
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,180
- I see. - Okay.

370
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:41,320
- It's perfect for our dinner. - There must be a twist.

371
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:44,015
(What will be the modified mission for Tsushima Island be?)

372
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,460
(As for Team Ji Hyo's mission is...)

373
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:47,860
(treating 100 people to a meal.)

374
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,830
- This is hard. - We have so many ingredients.

375
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,730
It'll take a long time to prepare them.

376
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:52,930
We're doomed.

377
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,000
(They must cook potato dough soup, pancakes, and suyuk.)

378
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:57,030
Since the elders of the village go to sleep early,

379
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,600
- you must serve them by 6:30pm. - What did you say?

380
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,470
(They must prepare it by 6:30pm to fit their regular dinnertime.)

381
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:01,570
This is terrible.

382
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:03,110
- What should we do then? - First,

383
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:04,780
let's wash these ingredients.

384
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,810
(There's no time to lose.)

385
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:07,110
It's really heavy.

386
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:08,775
Hello, ma'am.

387
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,850
(Jong Kook and Se Chan go around to spread the word.)

388
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:14,150
We would like to cook a meal for you.

389
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:16,690
You should come by and tell us when everything is ready.

390
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:18,520
(There's only one way to spread the word about the meal.)

391
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,930
Hey, shouldn't we go up there?

392
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,590
(They must go around the whole village to spread the word.)

393
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,900
We'll serve it at 6:30pm I know it's slightly late.

394
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,770
(They must serve the meal by 6:30pm and gather 100 people by 7:30pm.)

395
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:30,700
Do you know what's happening at 6:30pm?

396
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,940
- We'll serve you food at 6:30pm. - Come over there later.

397
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:35,170
We'll give you delicious food.

398
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,110
(Will Team Ji Hyo be able to cook a meal for 100 people?)

399
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,580
I'm serious. I mean it.

400
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:40,435
We'll see you later.

401
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:42,480
(Meanwhile, Ji Hyo and Byul start preparing the ingredients.)

402
00:14:42,485 --> 00:14:44,405
When will I wash all of them?

403
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,250
Since the elders go to sleep early...

404
00:14:47,256 --> 00:14:48,650
I'm rushing it now.

405
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,750
So we should hurry, shouldn't we?

406
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,020
Gosh, there's so much we have to do. We're in trouble.

407
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,225
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

408
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,830
We don't have much time left. Seriously.

409
00:14:58,834 --> 00:15:03,270
(She prepares the ingredients one by one under the pressure.)

410
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:04,800
You know what?

411
00:15:04,807 --> 00:15:07,840
We have so many potatoes. We need to peel them quickly.

412
00:15:07,843 --> 00:15:11,135
Where's the newest producer who seemed to be a terrible cook?

413
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,610
Can you at least get us someone?

414
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,940
Will you use one of your ballots?

415
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:15,505
Fine, I will.

416
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,720
We'll offer you a deal.

417
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,875
If you give us back one of your ballots,

418
00:15:21,357 --> 00:15:24,015
you'll get a new producer as your assistant.

419
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:26,820
You just used one of your ballots.

420
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:28,730
- Okay. - This is Producer Yoo Jung Chan.

421
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:30,285
Jung Chan.

422
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:31,660
Hurry.

423
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,795
By the way, have you cooked before?

424
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:36,700
- This is my first time. - What?

425
00:15:36,705 --> 00:15:39,235
(He knows nothing about cooking.)

426
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:42,010
Goodness, it's driving me crazy.

427
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:45,280
But even if he hasn't done it, he might have a knack for it.

428
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,110
Do you see the sides here?

429
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,610
You have to carve this part out.

430
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:50,880
(Under Ji Hyo's instruction, he's trying to find his secret talent.)

431
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:53,575
(Come out, my talent.)

432
00:15:54,456 --> 00:15:55,890
Stop right there. Do you job right.

433
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,190
What is this? Look what you did.

434
00:15:58,194 --> 00:16:00,420
This is for the elders. Do your job right!

435
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:02,555
- I was trying to do it faster. - Faster?

436
00:16:03,132 --> 00:16:05,625
You're so frustrating!

437
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:07,400
I would like to ask for my ballot back.

438
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:10,070
- He's still on his first potato. - I think...

439
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:12,400
- he's more like an obstacle. - Goodness, he is...

440
00:16:12,408 --> 00:16:14,810
- still on his second one. - He might just cause trouble.

441
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,110
- How could you be so slow? - I'm trying right now.

442
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:20,040
- I'll pick up my speed. - You're unbelievable.

443
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:21,380
By the way, I'm curious.

444
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,610
Are they preparing for the meal? We don't have any helper.

445
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:27,820
- I can't trust that producer. - You mean the new producer?

446
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,890
- He seemed he knew nothing. - Right.

447
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:31,615
(He looks like he knows nothing about cooking.)

448
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,090
- They're back. - They're back.

449
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:34,490
(They finally return after going around the village.)

450
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,130
- Hold on. - Hurry.

451
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:38,030
- What is this? You already got him? - Are we using the new producer?

452
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,630
Yes, I did. I had no choice.

453
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,830
- Come on. You shouldn't have. - Why not?

454
00:16:41,837 --> 00:16:43,970
- We thought he wouldn't be of help. - He won't be helpful.

455
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,740
We were talking about that before coming in.

456
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,870
We thought that he wouldn't be much help anyway.

457
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:50,070
We thought about getting someone else even if...

458
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,480
- we had to use more ballots. - What's that?

459
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:54,350
- That... - Why are you holding the camera?

460
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,975
- Me? - Yes.

461
00:16:56,452 --> 00:16:58,220
We went to interview people.

462
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,650
When I asked them if they knew who he was,

463
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:01,820
they said they knew.

464
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,790
They asked if Se Chan wasn't the cameraman.

465
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,390
- Se Chan? - That's what they said.

466
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:07,190
Since then, he became a cameraman.

467
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:08,260
Let me wash my hands first.

468
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:10,160
- What should we do first? - The dough soup.

469
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,100
- We should peel the potatoes first. - Yes.

470
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:15,200
- What is he doing? - He's peeling potatoes.

471
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:19,670
- That's not how you do it! - What are you doing?

472
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,210
What are you doing?

473
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,640
Are you sharpening pencils? Let me see how you did it.

474
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:26,380
Jong Kook, we're not lying. We used him for two minutes.

475
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:28,975
Ji Hyo got angry only after a minute.

476
00:17:29,351 --> 00:17:31,450
Why did you get this delicate guy?

477
00:17:31,453 --> 00:17:33,620
Can we get someone else instead of him?

478
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,285
He said we couldn't.

479
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:36,950
Hey.

480
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,785
(Hey, Mr. Producer. Please do a good job.)

481
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:41,990
(I'll do a good job.)

482
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,360
We have to grind the potatoes as soon as we can.

483
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:47,160
- How will we do that? - Then potatoes will have layers.

484
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,000
- Jong Kook. Here. - Okay. Where? I see.

485
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:51,240
- Grind it, and pour it there. - Into this?

486
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,835
Okay.

487
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,165
(Jong Kook, the human blender, starts working.)

488
00:17:57,913 --> 00:18:01,545
(Se Chan starts peeling the potato with an invisible motor.)

489
00:18:02,117 --> 00:18:05,550
I have a question. I'm really curious.

490
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:07,280
- Do you cut your bangs? - My bangs?

491
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:08,820
(His bangs are crooked.)

492
00:18:08,824 --> 00:18:10,450
(The new producer's harsh struggle at his job)

493
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:11,620
I was really curious.

494
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:13,690
- Are you all right? - I asked him because...

495
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,830
- I was curious. - Hang in there. I was there too.

496
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,760
I thought his hairstyle was cute.

497
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,255
(Getting his microphone)

498
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,370
- Hold on. - Where are you going?

499
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,125
(Where are you going? You were working!)

500
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:25,340
Come back.

501
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,540
(Meanwhile, when the new producer is getting used to this environment...)

502
00:18:27,543 --> 00:18:28,840
We're done peeling the potatoes.

503
00:18:28,844 --> 00:18:29,910
- You're done? - Yes.

504
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:31,480
- Great! - I'm done.

505
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
- Jong Kook, use a blender. - Yes?

506
00:18:33,649 --> 00:18:35,910
- That will take forever. - We don't have time.

507
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:39,250
- We can use a blender? - Yes, we can do it with a blender.

508
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,850
Then why did you give me this?

509
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:42,550
It was...

510
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,860
We're busy right now. Just use the blender.

511
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,390
Byul, she said I could use a blender. Why am I doing this?

512
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,425
(She said I could use the blender.)

513
00:18:50,265 --> 00:18:52,730
Isn't it nice? It makes you look like you're working hard.

514
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,630
(It makes you look like a helpful guy.)

515
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,100
- This is crazy. - Jong Kook.

516
00:18:56,105 --> 00:18:58,270
- I wanted you to stand out. - That's why.

517
00:18:58,273 --> 00:18:59,570
You can show off your arm muscles.

518
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,440
(If so, I'll work harder.)

519
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:03,910
- Jong Kook, seriously. - But I grated a lot of potatoes.

520
00:19:03,912 --> 00:19:06,380
- It's been a while. - I'll make the broth then.

521
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:09,310
- Okay. - Se Chan will replace me.

522
00:19:09,318 --> 00:19:11,005
The knife is not very sharp.

523
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,485
(Se Chan starts julienning the carrots.)

524
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,820
(It's not perfect, but he does his best.)

525
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,655
Gosh.

526
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,460
Use that.

527
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,030
(Mandoline?)

528
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,925
- That one. - Like this?

529
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,625
Wait.

530
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:31,100
(Convenient)

531
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,940
Byul, it works.

532
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,070
Why were you using a knife?

533
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:36,440
It's so fast this way.

534
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:38,040
We had a mandoline?

535
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,905
It's so fast.

536
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,145
We have to make 100 servings.

537
00:19:45,154 --> 00:19:47,320
Why were you using a knife?

538
00:19:47,322 --> 00:19:48,390
Okay.

539
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,750
I need to scoop them out.

540
00:19:49,758 --> 00:19:51,320
(Everyone is busy preparing the ingredients.)

541
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,990
Let me have a taste.

542
00:19:53,996 --> 00:19:57,125
(Byul starts making the stock.)

543
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:03,295
(The star chef leads the project of making 100 servings.)

544
00:20:03,405 --> 00:20:10,205
(She chose the dishes herself and studied the recipes.)

545
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,475
(She even considered the balance between carbs and protein.)

546
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,050
We have to boil the meat too.

547
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:23,845
We have to make pancakes too.

548
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:27,390
That's going in the batter anyway.

549
00:20:27,396 --> 00:20:28,560
(Her charisma makes even Jong Kook obey her.)

550
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,260
You don't have to stir it.

551
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,030
Be generous with ingredients.

552
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,630
(Everyone, follow me.)

553
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,200
- Se Chan. - Yes?

554
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:37,500
Don't forget to julienne the zucchinis.

555
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:38,540
Okay.

556
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,100
(Okay. As you say.)

557
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,040
I have to julienne the zucchinis too?

558
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,740
- Yes. - Okay.

559
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,240
(I was nobody until the star chef called my name.)

560
00:20:46,248 --> 00:20:49,050
Chop the onions too.

561
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:50,050
Okay.

562
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,220
(I was nobody until the star chef called my name.)

563
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,745
Gosh.

564
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,690
It's separating, right?

565
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,945
We're using only what's at the bottom.

566
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:00,585
But it takes a while for it to separate.

567
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,590
Do we need more zucchinis?

568
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,730
Use more.

569
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,060
We're making 100 servings.

570
00:21:06,068 --> 00:21:07,595
(Ji Hyo, the knife girl)

571
00:21:08,203 --> 00:21:10,600
(I can chop everything.)

572
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:11,800
(There's nothing she can't chop.)

573
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,940
Jong Kook, put these in...

574
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:15,310
and add a bit of water.

575
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,840
- Right. Otherwise, it won't blend. - No.

576
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:19,335
It needs water.

577
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:22,610
(It won't blend without water?)

578
00:21:22,618 --> 00:21:25,050
(But his glare would blend anything.)

579
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:27,350
(He cooks with his eyes.)

580
00:21:27,356 --> 00:21:28,620
Okay, good.

581
00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:30,120
It's perfect.

582
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,455
(His glare makes potatoes melt.)

583
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,590
This step takes the longest.

584
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:37,190
(It takes the longest time to make the batter.)

585
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,200
Give me that.

586
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,495
(Trust me.)

587
00:21:40,936 --> 00:21:43,825
(Glaring)

588
00:21:44,506 --> 00:21:47,910
(Like ripening rice plants,)

589
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,340
(Jong Kook bows down while blending potatoes.)

590
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:52,780
My back hurts.

591
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:56,545
(Jong Kook blends the potatoes with his eyes.)

592
00:21:58,086 --> 00:22:00,920
I can't believe we were going to use a grater.

593
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:03,120
We wouldn't have been finished until tomorrow morning.

594
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,820
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook work together.)

595
00:22:04,826 --> 00:22:07,490
I hope it'll taste good.

596
00:22:07,496 --> 00:22:09,730
So do I. We're making it with care.

597
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:11,030
(Ji Hyo and Jong Kook are making dough soup.)

598
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:13,160
- It'll taste good. - Se Chan.

599
00:22:13,168 --> 00:22:16,270
- Let's prepare water for the meat. - Okay.

600
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:18,800
Byul.

601
00:22:18,807 --> 00:22:20,540
We should chop the pork first.

602
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,365
You're right.

603
00:22:22,611 --> 00:22:24,070
It's okay with big chunks, right?

604
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,735
Just as big as fresh pork belly.

605
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,610
That looks good.

606
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:32,050
That's how big the chunks should be when boiling.

607
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,180
Like this.

608
00:22:33,188 --> 00:22:34,550
- It looks good. - It looks good.

609
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:35,890
- It looks very good. - It's going to taste so good.

610
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:37,785
It's going to taste good.

611
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,120
Ground coffee...

612
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,330
I read on the internet that ground coffee helps.

613
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:46,730
It removes the bad smell.

614
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:47,860
It's okay with just beer.

615
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,330
- Instead of water? - You need water too.

616
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:51,700
- Coffee is better. - Coffee?

617
00:22:51,707 --> 00:22:56,340
I used just beer a few days ago,

618
00:22:56,345 --> 00:22:59,180
and it tasted very good. It became really soft.

619
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:02,345
If you have different opinions, why don't we just order it?

620
00:23:02,351 --> 00:23:05,350
I know this old lady. I can ask her for help.

621
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:06,850
She can prepare a lot.

622
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:08,650
It'd be better than fighting like this.

623
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:09,890
(Every family has a different recipe.)

624
00:23:09,891 --> 00:23:12,020
I think we can put everything.

625
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,260
Put everything.

626
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,885
Okay!

627
00:23:14,963 --> 00:23:16,060
Put everything.

628
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:18,100
Making 100 servings is no easy task.

629
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,900
- Of course. - It's so much work.

630
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,525
Gosh.

631
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:23,630
- I'm adding beer. - Okay.

632
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:24,740
- Okay! - Good!

633
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,435
Good!

634
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:29,040
And some coffee.

635
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,170
(Ground coffee is added too.)

636
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:32,540
It smells like cappuccino.

637
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,910
Bay leaves.

638
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:35,010
(All the good ingredients are added.)

639
00:23:35,017 --> 00:23:36,880
Are you sure it's not too much?

640
00:23:36,885 --> 00:23:38,575
It's not.

641
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,950
- Just put a lot. - We're making 100 servings.

642
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,745
We have to serve delicious food.

643
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,855
It's hot.

644
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:48,990
(The meat goes in.)

645
00:23:48,997 --> 00:23:50,590
It smells good.

646
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,960
- It smells good. - Peppercorns.

647
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,325
- It smells good. - It's already cooking.

648
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,670
(All the preparation for suyuk is done.)

649
00:23:57,673 --> 00:24:00,370
We have to make pancakes too.

650
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,305
- Se Chan, prepare chili peppers. - Okay.

651
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,140
What should I do now?

652
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,980
- Please remove the shrimp tails. - Shrimp tails.

653
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:10,610
Squid, onions, zucchinis, and carrots.

654
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:12,715
(There's so much to do.)

655
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:15,420
Can we make it?

656
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:18,785
Can we make it? Do we have enough time?

657
00:24:19,628 --> 00:24:20,920
My goodness.

658
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:23,060
(They speed up.)

659
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:25,200
I don't think we have enough time.

660
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,460
(But time passes by faster and faster.)

661
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:29,125
How are we going to finish everything?

662
00:24:29,938 --> 00:24:32,040
I removed all the tails.

663
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,995
I'm worried about time.

664
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:40,535
I've never prepared so much food at once before.

665
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,950
- What is this? - How much chili peppers?

666
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:44,950
(The sun is setting.)

667
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:47,050
100 servings is a lot.

668
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:48,120
Let's start frying the pancakes now.

669
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:49,790
Se Chan and I will do it.

670
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,415
Jong Kook and I will make dough soup.

671
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:54,390
Gosh.

672
00:24:54,396 --> 00:24:55,730
My goodness.

673
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:56,790
(They divide up the work.)

674
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,060
100 servings is so much.

675
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,030
Luckily, the dough soup will be...

676
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,970
more than 100 servings.

677
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:06,765
(Will they manage to prepare 100 servings in time?)

678
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,480
It smells pretty good.

679
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,310
- Jong Kook. - Yes?

680
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:14,910
That looks great.

681
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,010
(They put a lot of care into every dish.)

682
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:17,150
That was smart, right?

683
00:25:17,152 --> 00:25:18,750
- It looks amazing. - I used chili peppers.

684
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:20,020
- Chili peppers? - Yes.

685
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,120
It looks great.

686
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,920
(They try their best to make the food look tasty.)

687
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:24,220
Look at this.

688
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,560
It looks amazing.

689
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,420
Green onion pancakes...

690
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:28,460
Gosh.

691
00:25:28,463 --> 00:25:30,790
What time is it?

692
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,660
(They have about 40 minutes left.)

693
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,330
We're in trouble.

694
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:36,565
We have to finish in time.

695
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:38,340
A lot of people came already.

696
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,540
- Oh, no. - Really?

697
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,065
(A lot of people came already.)

698
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:46,275
(Some villagers have been waiting for an hour.)

699
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:51,050
Jong Kook, we're being a bit delayed.

700
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:53,650
Why don't you and I go and tell them?

701
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,420
I think the cameraman should go.

702
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,515
(He's reminded of a bad memory.)

703
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
I'm a cameraman. Talking is not my job.

704
00:26:00,462 --> 00:26:03,730
I think the cameraman should go. What do you think?

705
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:05,400
I want the actor to come with me.

706
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,530
(Cameramen follow actors.)

707
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,570
Cameramen are supposed to follow actors.

708
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,570
(Persuaded)

709
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:11,570
- You have your camera ready? - Yes.

710
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:14,295
- Let's go. - Okay.

711
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:17,910
Film me while I put this on. Does it look good?

712
00:26:17,913 --> 00:26:20,440
What should we tell them?

713
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:23,050
Let's tell them we're being a bit delayed.

714
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:25,850
- They'll have to wait. - That's right.

715
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:28,885
(How many came?)

716
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,420
- Hello. - Hello.

717
00:26:31,426 --> 00:26:32,420
(Full)

718
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,590
Sorry you had to wait.

719
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:36,090
Many people came.

720
00:26:36,097 --> 00:26:37,360
(So many people came.)

721
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:39,200
We're sorry.

722
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,460
We've been preparing food,

723
00:26:41,469 --> 00:26:43,200
and it's taking a lot of time.

724
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:46,240
So we came to apologize.

725
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:47,770
You're a bit bored, right?

726
00:26:47,776 --> 00:26:49,410
- Yes! - I see.

727
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,240
- But now I feel good. - Are you sure?

728
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:54,240
- Are you happy to see us? - Yes!

729
00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,450
- I don't feel hungry anymore. - For our guests...

730
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,320
We should sing a song.

731
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,645
(We want to hear a song.)

732
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:03,850
(Excited)

733
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,560
- While we wait, we should have fun. - Of course.

734
00:27:06,561 --> 00:27:09,055
Let's have some fun.

735
00:27:09,397 --> 00:27:11,900
- Let's go. - While we sing,

736
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,500
the staff will count...

737
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:16,700
how many of you are here.

738
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:18,030
(The number of guests will be count until 7:30pm.)

739
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,935
Please stay here.

740
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,940
- Let's go. - Let's go.

741
00:27:21,943 --> 00:27:23,770
(They suddenly start to sing.)

742
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:26,540
(They sing "Unconditional", hoping they get more than 100 guests.)

743
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:28,110
(Fun)

744
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:29,710
Unconditional!

745
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:33,345
(Dancing)

746
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,250
(Enjoy our performance...)

747
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:41,185
(while you wait for food.)

748
00:27:46,735 --> 00:27:49,330
(Their stage presence...)

749
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:52,935
(makes you stop feeling hungry.)

750
00:27:53,642 --> 00:27:55,140
(Smiles...)

751
00:27:55,143 --> 00:27:58,935
(come to the faces of the guests.)

752
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:03,480
(While Jong Kook and Se Chan are buying some time,)

753
00:28:03,485 --> 00:28:06,880
(Byul is cooking with both hands.)

754
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:08,620
My goodness.

755
00:28:08,623 --> 00:28:11,915
It's so much work to prepare 100 servings.

756
00:28:13,161 --> 00:28:14,890
Does it work?

757
00:28:14,896 --> 00:28:16,460
I hope it does.

758
00:28:16,464 --> 00:28:19,060
(What if we don't get 100 guests?)

759
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,500
Come on in.

760
00:28:20,502 --> 00:28:23,165
We're still counting the guests.

761
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:26,170
Delicious food will be served...

762
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:27,540
shortly.

763
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,670
You have to sing along.

764
00:28:29,678 --> 00:28:31,265
Here we go.

765
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:34,640
(They sing "The Southbound Train" while waiting for more guests.)

766
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:36,950
Let's sing "The Southbound Train"!

767
00:28:36,952 --> 00:28:38,520
Please sing along!

768
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,450
Let's have some fun!

769
00:28:40,455 --> 00:28:43,650
Let's hear Jong Kook sing.

770
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,020
Here we go!

771
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:47,685
(The train leaves, hoping for the success of the mission.)

772
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:50,325
(The first table is full.)

773
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,700
(The other tables are almost full too.)

774
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:57,125
(But the food is not ready yet.)

775
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,540
(The performance makes it easier to wait for the food.)

776
00:29:00,542 --> 00:29:03,340
When will the food be ready?

777
00:29:03,345 --> 00:29:04,410
(Time is running out.)

778
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:06,405
How long do we have to wait?

779
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,180
(Only 10 minutes remain.)

780
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:10,980
We have to cut suyuk too.

781
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,420
I should check on it.

782
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,015
(Suyuk is ready.)

783
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,120
It looks good.

784
00:29:19,127 --> 00:29:20,615
It looks delicious.

785
00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:23,060
People have to eat it when it's still hot.

786
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:24,060
(Suyuk is marinated with various ingredients.)

787
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:26,595
- Look at this. - Goodness.

788
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:27,860
It's amazing.

789
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,270
(She plates the meat after cutting it into pieces.)

790
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,925
My goodness.

791
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,935
It looks delicious.

792
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:35,710
Chan Young.

793
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,010
- Yes? - Come here now.

794
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:39,110
Line up the plates.

795
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:41,475
- I'm Jung Chan. - Jung Chan.

796
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:45,645
(Don't forget. I'm Chan Young.)

797
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,520
We can count one plate for each table.

798
00:29:49,524 --> 00:29:50,620
(Food is getting ready.)

799
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:55,460
(Jong Kook is having his year end concert in Gangwon Province.)

800
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,460
(Absorbed)

801
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:58,530
What is it?

802
00:29:58,533 --> 00:29:59,600
I will love you

803
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,230
Give him a round of applause.

804
00:30:01,236 --> 00:30:03,800
(They don't know how many people came.)

805
00:30:03,805 --> 00:30:05,700
This is great.

806
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:07,840
You should sing one more.

807
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:09,735
All right.

808
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:11,340
Here I go.

809
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:12,780
(At that time)

810
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:13,810
Hello.

811
00:30:13,815 --> 00:30:14,910
(Food arrives on time.)

812
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:16,510
Hello.

813
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:18,420
(Did you wait a long time? Food is here.)

814
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,415
- Let's go. - Hello.

815
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,090
They're Ji Hyo and Byul.

816
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:23,985
Here's one.

817
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:25,920
Help yourselves.

818
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,560
Food is being served.

819
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:30,260
You haven't gotten one, right?

820
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:31,830
(Seafood pajeon and kimchi jeon are served.)

821
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:32,830
Enjoy.

822
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,925
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

823
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:36,995
Here's some dough soup.

824
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:39,670
Ma'am, we worked very hard.

825
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:42,935
- Thank you for the food. - Please enjoy.

826
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:48,675
(Everyone regardless of age enjoys the food.)

827
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:50,410
How many minutes do we have left?

828
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:52,245
I don't know.

829
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,350
How many people are inside?

830
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,820
(Only 13 minutes remain.)

831
00:30:55,824 --> 00:30:57,090
(Current number of people)

832
00:30:57,092 --> 00:30:59,420
There are 95 people.

833
00:30:59,427 --> 00:31:00,920
(It's 95 people.)

834
00:31:00,929 --> 00:31:02,430
- We need 5 more people. - 5?

835
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,990
Five more people?

836
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,600
It won't be easy for five to come at this time.

837
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:10,300
We don't have time. Let's try to do something.

838
00:31:10,305 --> 00:31:12,170
Wait, I'll check over there.

839
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:13,700
(How can we invite five more people?)

840
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,110
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

841
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,035
You should eat.

842
00:31:18,113 --> 00:31:20,810
Excuse me. Please put a sticker on him.

843
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:23,410
You haven't eaten yet. You should go eat.

844
00:31:23,418 --> 00:31:24,710
(They need 4 more people.)

845
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,880
- The village leader? - He was the last.

846
00:31:26,888 --> 00:31:29,520
He's sitting at the edge of the table.

847
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,890
He didn't put the sticker on.

848
00:31:31,893 --> 00:31:33,790
- Someone doesn't have the sticker. - There's someone.

849
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,490
At the end on the right?

850
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:38,830
Is any of you brother of the village leader?

851
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,860
- Brother of the village leader? - Do you not a number?

852
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,900
- Do you not have a number? - He doesn't.

853
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:45,770
(He is the 97th guest.)

854
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,970
We have 97 people.

855
00:31:47,976 --> 00:31:50,710
Do you know anyone who is on his way?

856
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,410
Do you need more? Shall I call them?

857
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,910
- Ma'am. - Everyone came.

858
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:55,710
If they can come, invite them.

859
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,810
Please bring anyone you can.

860
00:31:57,819 --> 00:31:59,780
- We need 3 more people. - We need 3 more.

861
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,020
- Three more. - Three more people?

862
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:02,320
Are they coming? Really?

863
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:04,220
- Three people are coming. - Where?

864
00:32:04,225 --> 00:32:06,220
- Hurrry. - Go get them.

865
00:32:06,227 --> 00:32:07,560
Here they are.

866
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:09,630
There they are. Ma'am.

867
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:12,160
Ma'am, here you go.

868
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:14,600
- Are we done? - We need one more person.

869
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:17,030
- Put one on the baby. - I'll put it on his head.

870
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:18,670
- That's cute. - He's so cute.

871
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,140
Enjoy your meal.

872
00:32:20,141 --> 00:32:22,010
(They need 1 more person.)

873
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,535
Where?

874
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,110
Is the light on?

875
00:32:26,114 --> 00:32:28,240
Is your husband coming?

876
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:29,280
(She calls her husband at home.)

877
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:31,180
- He should come. - I'll ask him.

878
00:32:31,186 --> 00:32:33,720
We need one more person. I beg you.

879
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:35,290
What happened?

880
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,020
Is he coming?

881
00:32:37,025 --> 00:32:39,120
It'd be disappointing If we're short on one person and fail.

882
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,160
(All their efforts could be in vain.)

883
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:42,655
- I'd feel so empty. - Me too.

884
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,630
(They have 2 minutes left.)

885
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:47,600
We only need one more person. Please.

886
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:49,770
Someone has to come quickly.

887
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:51,400
He must come fast.

888
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:53,440
- Someone is coming. - I think she's bringing him.

889
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,395
Someone is coming.

890
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,210
She's bringing him over there.

891
00:32:58,213 --> 00:32:59,880
- He's coming. - Sir.

892
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,310
Ma'am.

893
00:33:01,316 --> 00:33:04,775
(They have one minute before the time is up.)

894
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,080
(Behind the woman...)

895
00:33:07,088 --> 00:33:09,420
(is her husband.)

896
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:11,120
Sir, you can take your time.

897
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:14,115
(They've been waiting for their last guest.)

898
00:33:14,462 --> 00:33:16,730
- He came. - Sir.

899
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,830
Gosh, thank you for coming.

900
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,495
He ran here.

901
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:25,500
(100th guest arrives with 1 minute on the clock.)

902
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:26,995
He's here.

903
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,410
- Thank you, sir. - He arrived.

904
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,575
Please give him a round of applause.

905
00:33:32,914 --> 00:33:34,240
Thank you.

906
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,710
- Thank you. - Take a seat over there.

907
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:39,250
- Enjoy our food. - Goodness.

908
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:42,150
(We thank the residents of Songcheon, Gangwon Province.)

909
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:44,420
- Thank you. - Good job.

910
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,420
(Their busy night continues.)

911
00:33:45,426 --> 00:33:47,990
- Good job. - Good job, everyone.

912
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:51,030
It's impressive how we cleared a mission.

913
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,460
- That's true. - Seriously.

914
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:54,595
To be honest,

915
00:33:54,602 --> 00:33:57,070
we don't know the whole mission.

916
00:33:57,071 --> 00:34:00,900
Though we're hungry, we didn't eat in case we suffer.

917
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:04,140
- Right. - We hardly ate anything.

918
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:07,680
Little bit of hunger is bearable.

919
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,110
We only had water and rice.

920
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:12,280
Why are we going to a sashimi restaurant?

921
00:34:12,287 --> 00:34:15,920
It's for us to clear the mission.

922
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,545
Like sheep!

923
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:20,020
- We, who spare nothing to give! - Nothing to give!

924
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,655
- Are the best! - Are the best!

925
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,260
(They forget their hunger and temptation with the chant.)

926
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,000
Let's take a rest.

927
00:34:28,002 --> 00:34:30,665
Could you turn off the lights?

928
00:34:31,306 --> 00:34:38,610
(Team Si Young finally enjoys peace after a long fight.)

929
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:42,405
(Ruffling sounds)

930
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:47,820
(Wait, what is this ruffling sound?)

931
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,090
Turn on the light.

932
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,720
(This won't work.)

933
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:52,190
I'm sorry.

934
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:55,090
I wanted to take a rest.

935
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:56,360
Are you eating something alone?

936
00:34:56,364 --> 00:34:57,890
(He starts to interrogate.)

937
00:34:57,899 --> 00:35:00,725
(Gulping)

938
00:35:00,902 --> 00:35:02,000
(All right.)

939
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,230
I had some.

940
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:05,995
(Yes, I ate a donut.)

941
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:09,270
Did you think I was sleeping?

942
00:35:09,277 --> 00:35:10,610
(He starts to criticize.)

943
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,235
Is it delicious?

944
00:35:12,246 --> 00:35:13,540
- Are you happy? - I'm low on sugar.

945
00:35:13,548 --> 00:35:16,080
You should have some too.

946
00:35:16,084 --> 00:35:18,150
No, you ruined my appetite.

947
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:19,450
No thank you.

948
00:35:19,454 --> 00:35:21,545
Give me the ballot.

949
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:23,645
Or become our enemies.

950
00:35:24,425 --> 00:35:27,620
I'd really like to know why you're angry.

951
00:35:27,628 --> 00:35:29,530
- Listen. - Don't you know why?

952
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,690
No.

953
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:33,825
What? How can you eat?

954
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,900
This is all of my fault.

955
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:38,200
It's my fault.

956
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:40,440
I'll take out the ballot.

957
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:42,510
Take it if you really want it.

958
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,765
(He takes it immediately.)

959
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:48,410
(Gangster friends, always be happy and friendly to each other.)

960
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,675
(Punching)

961
00:35:51,152 --> 00:35:54,745
(She takes back the ballot.)

962
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,060
Are you okay?

963
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,685
Am I okay?

964
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:03,260
- Excuse me, driver. - I'll turn them off.

965
00:36:03,264 --> 00:36:04,855
(She's flustered.)

966
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,430
Thank you.

967
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:09,670
(After half a day, the driver realizes how to break their fight.)

968
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,700
Like sheep!

969
00:36:10,705 --> 00:36:12,300
(Whenever they feel tempted)

970
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:14,670
- We, who spare nothing to give! - we, who spare nothing to give!

971
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:15,710
- Are the best! - Are the best!

972
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,070
(We're gangsters.)

973
00:36:17,078 --> 00:36:18,810
Let's forget about it.

974
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:21,140
- I'm sorry for getting upset. - Okay.

975
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:24,405
(They arrive at a sashimi restaurant in Gangwon Province.)

976
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,980
(They're very hungry, and it's a feast.)

977
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:30,450
There's such a variety of dishes.

978
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,820
- Isn't this too harsh? - Look.

979
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,920
Is that what I think it is?

980
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,525
Everyone.

981
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:40,500
We prepared seasonal fish caught the most in Gangwon Province...

982
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:43,230
as well as other side dishes.

983
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:45,230
Help yourselves.

984
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,270
Excuse me.

985
00:36:46,274 --> 00:36:48,540
(It's a luxurious yet resentful seafood course meal.)

986
00:36:48,543 --> 00:36:50,340
Is this...

987
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:55,810
(We don't know what the mission is. Shall we just eat?)

988
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:56,910
What's our mission?

989
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,020
We'll tell you after the meal.

990
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,450
(Their mission in Gangwon Province will be announced after the meal.)

991
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:02,945
Pardon me?

992
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:07,460
(They must eat without knowing how the mission has changed.)

993
00:37:07,462 --> 00:37:11,290
Isn't catching shrimp difficult?

994
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:13,395
Snow crabs are also difficult, right?

995
00:37:13,668 --> 00:37:16,900
Don't we have to go to Jeju Island to catch sea urchin roe?

996
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:20,440
What we can eat is potatoes, kimchi...

997
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:22,810
(If we can't eat seafood)

998
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,465
Rolled omelette.

999
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,275
Excuse me.

1000
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,680
Can we get three bowls of rice?

1001
00:37:29,684 --> 00:37:32,320
(She tears up.)

1002
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,545
You should eat what you want. I'll do what I should.

1003
00:37:37,091 --> 00:37:39,655
- Are you about to cry? - Thank you for the food.

1004
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:41,720
(He pours soy sauce.)

1005
00:37:41,729 --> 00:37:42,730
My goodness.

1006
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:45,185
May I get some sesame oil?

1007
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,255
Why is he pouring that?

1008
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:50,325
This is rice with soy sauce and eggs.

1009
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:51,970
(Peeking)

1010
00:37:51,973 --> 00:37:54,070
They keep taking down notes.

1011
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:57,005
(The staff is taking down notes.)

1012
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:59,540
(The staff is checking what the members eat.)

1013
00:37:59,547 --> 00:38:01,310
- Haha. - No.

1014
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,710
Stop being so rash. We're a team.

1015
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,020
What did you eat?

1016
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,890
He ate something.

1017
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,720
Eggs are fine.

1018
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:13,955
They're writing something down.

1019
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,030
We haven't eaten much.

1020
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,125
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

1021
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,530
- It's delicious. - What's this?

1022
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:22,060
- Did you serve some for yourself? - No.

1023
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:24,795
(She served herself rolled omelette.)

1024
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,100
No, I stopped myself.

1025
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:31,110
You have three minutes left.

1026
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:33,310
Let's eat one thing.

1027
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:36,810
Only three minutes remain. It's better to hold back.

1028
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:38,180
Let's try.

1029
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:41,045
Let's eat one dish.

1030
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,090
Listen.

1031
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,790
We're at a sashimi restaurant.

1032
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:45,920
(She looks for hint.)

1033
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:47,920
Could you please stop doing that?

1034
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:50,225
(He binges on rice with soy sauce and eggs.)

1035
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:53,300
- Si Young. - Stop it.

1036
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:55,355
You're scaring me. Stop it.

1037
00:38:55,703 --> 00:38:56,700
(Let's eat one fish.)

1038
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,670
Aren't we going to eat anything?

1039
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:02,140
Time is up, and we'll clear the table.

1040
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:05,110
Before clearing the table, here's your mission since...

1041
00:39:05,112 --> 00:39:06,940
- Our mission is... - you really want to know.

1042
00:39:06,948 --> 00:39:09,335
We should have hard the mission earlier.

1043
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:11,375
Let me pull it off.

1044
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,180
Why are you pulling off everything?

1045
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:16,685
(She's so sensitive as she hasn't eaten anything.)

1046
00:39:17,391 --> 00:39:19,285
Don't you think you're full of anger?

1047
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:23,490
(Worried they'd have to catch a fish they ate,)

1048
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:25,700
(they didn't eat any fish.)

1049
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,300
(Was their guess right?)

1050
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:32,425
"Get one of the ingredients you didn't eat."

1051
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,510
"Get one of the ingredients you didn't eat."

1052
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,265
(Get one of the ingredients you didn't eat.)

1053
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,880
(Get one of the ingredients you didn't eat.)

1054
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:44,945
I told you we should eat!

1055
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:48,320
Hold on. "Get one of the ingredients..."

1056
00:39:48,322 --> 00:39:50,820
"you didn't eat."

1057
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,090
Let me tell you what we didn't eat.

1058
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,120
This, this, this...

1059
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:55,690
(There are too many.)

1060
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:57,060
This, this, and this.

1061
00:39:57,064 --> 00:39:58,760
(Flounder, sea pineapple, sandfish, seabream,)

1062
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,460
(shrimp, abalone, crab, sea urchin, rockfish, flatfish,)

1063
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:02,500
(seaweed, cockle)

1064
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:05,840
There are so many ingredients you didn't eat.

1065
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,740
So we narrowed it down...

1066
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,970
rockfish, sea bream, crab,

1067
00:40:10,978 --> 00:40:13,910
flatfish, sandfish, flounder, and shrimp.

1068
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,680
We narrowed it down to seven.

1069
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:17,910
- You'll pick... - The sandfish was full of roe.

1070
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,220
I hope we'll pick sandfish.

1071
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,220
It's in season, so it'll be easy to catch.

1072
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:22,985
Flatfish is easy to catch too.

1073
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:27,620
Pick one person who will make the choice.

1074
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,490
- Si Young. - No.

1075
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:32,090
- Please don't do this. - You're our leader.

1076
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,760
You're our leader.

1077
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,000
You should pick.

1078
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:36,625
(They suddenly agree with each other.)

1079
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,000
(Si Young will pick a kind of fish.)

1080
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:39,970
I want you to pick one of the two.

1081
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:42,870
- Flatfish or sandfish. - Sandfish.

1082
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,565
If you succeed,

1083
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:46,240
you'll be our hero.

1084
00:40:46,247 --> 00:40:47,740
You'll be our hero all day.

1085
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:50,105
You know that it's an important choice, right?

1086
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,680
Relax.

1087
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:52,850
(Will she be a hero or an enemy?)

1088
00:40:52,853 --> 00:40:54,750
I'm not going to think too much.

1089
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:58,850
(The success of their second mission is in Si Young's hands.)

1090
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,685
I'll choose between the first and the last.

1091
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,390
(She drops the rest.)

1092
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:03,890
I'll choose one...

1093
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:05,330
of these two.

1094
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,400
Which one do you want?

1095
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,395
(Which one will they choose?)

1096
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:10,395
This one?

1097
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:11,730
This one?

1098
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:12,870
Then I'll choose the other one.

1099
00:41:12,873 --> 00:41:14,470
(Then I'll choose the other one.)

1100
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:17,040
(Kwang Soo is always wrong.)

1101
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:20,075
(That's a good idea.)

1102
00:41:20,181 --> 00:41:22,610
(They made a logical choice.)

1103
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:25,010
(Will they get either sandfish or flatfish?)

1104
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,115
(Let me see.)

1105
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,320
(Is it something hard to catch?)

1106
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:32,490
What is it?

1107
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:34,020
(Worried)

1108
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,655
Is it crab?

1109
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,030
No way.

1110
00:41:37,031 --> 00:41:40,330
(Haha takes a look.)

1111
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:43,470
(Is it either sandfish or flatfish?)

1112
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:47,265
(Or is it something more difficult?)

1113
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,410
No way.

1114
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,280
(Worried)

1115
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,550
(Sandfish)

1116
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,275
Yes!

1117
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:02,750
(The sandfish hero)

1118
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:04,020
Like sheep...

1119
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,120
(Let's shout it together!)

1120
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:06,760
We, who spare nothing to give!

1121
00:42:06,761 --> 00:42:07,890
- Are the best! - Are the best!

1122
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,860
(Like sheep, we, who spare nothing to give, are the best!)

1123
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:12,600
(Their second mission is decided.)

1124
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,260
(In Tsushima Island, they had to catch a fish they ate.)

1125
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,570
(In Gangwon Province, they'll catch sandfish, which they didn't eat.)

1126
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,030
All right.

1127
00:42:18,038 --> 00:42:21,700
After catching a sand fish, there is an additional mission...

1128
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:23,365
you have to complete.

1129
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,610
(They have to complete an additional mission too.)

1130
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,540
- What? - There's another mission?

1131
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,210
Please hear me out.

1132
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:31,050
It turns out...

1133
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:34,320
sandfish are caught early in the morning.

1134
00:42:34,321 --> 00:42:37,520
So you'll have to wake up at 3am.

1135
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:39,660
(They have to wake up at 3am.)

1136
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,255
Can we even say we'll "wake up"?

1137
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,290
We'll have to stay up all night.

1138
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:47,195
You can go back to the guesthouse now.

1139
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:48,500
Like sheep!

1140
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:49,570
(Whenever things get tough...)

1141
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,625
- We, who spare nothing to give! - We, who spare nothing to give!

1142
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,740
- Are the best! - Are the best!

1143
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:57,105
(What will the sandfish mission be like?)

1144
00:42:57,311 --> 00:42:58,640
- That's right. - It was here.

1145
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:01,010
This is where we got on the taxi.

1146
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,880
It was right here.

1147
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:05,920
- It was here, right? - Gosh.

1148
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,680
(Where did it go wrong?)

1149
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,820
We must be possessed by noodles ghosts.

1150
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:13,120
(Are we in a wantanmien trap?)

1151
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:15,760
(But the worst part starts here.)

1152
00:43:15,763 --> 00:43:20,625
(The steak mission started in Okinawa.)

1153
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:25,630
(Soba, ramen, soba, ramen...)

1154
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,040
(They were caught up in a noodle maze.)

1155
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,140
Taxi.

1156
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,970
(They resume the steak mission in Hong Kong.)

1157
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,580
(The noodle torture starts again.)

1158
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:35,710
I don't believe we'll eat noodles after this too.

1159
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:41,115
(They can't seem to escape.)

1160
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:44,850
(They get a taxi to get out of the area.)

1161
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:47,190
(But...)

1162
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:50,185
(they're back to the wantanmien place.)

1163
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:54,700
(Will they be able to wake up from this nightmare?)

1164
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:57,500
- We must be possessed. - It's driving me crazy.

1165
00:43:57,504 --> 00:44:00,300
- It's like the Mobius strip. - It's unbelievable.

1166
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:03,310
They already closed, and we're back here.

1167
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,840
When we went far away...

1168
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,240
Is it closed?

1169
00:44:06,247 --> 00:44:07,740
Yes, we're closed.

1170
00:44:07,748 --> 00:44:09,680
Okay.

1171
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:11,480
Guys.

1172
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,420
(The wantanmien place is closed.)

1173
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,880
Please try again.

1174
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:16,450
Do you want to spin it? Should I do it?

1175
00:44:16,457 --> 00:44:18,245
Seriously...

1176
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:19,990
We have to meet a taxi driver.

1177
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:22,220
We have to get out of here.

1178
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:24,485
We have to get out of the area.

1179
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:25,930
Please.

1180
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:31,995
(As So Min wishes, will they meet a taxi driver?)

1181
00:44:32,973 --> 00:44:35,300
(A convenience store clerk?)

1182
00:44:35,309 --> 00:44:37,170
- Convenience store clerk. - Convenience store clerk.

1183
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,005
- Convenience store clerk. - Convenience store.

1184
00:44:39,146 --> 00:44:40,975
- Let's find a convenience store. - Convenience store clerk.

1185
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:42,910
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1186
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,950
(They look for a convenience store.)

1187
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:46,945
- Let's find a convenience store. - But...

1188
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:50,620
I have a feeling they'll say noodles again.

1189
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:52,050
- That's not okay. - I have a feeling.

1190
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:54,360
I'm traumatized.

1191
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,930
(Don't even say that.)

1192
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,190
We're shooting Running Noodles, not Running Man.

1193
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,360
Running Noodles.

1194
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,800
- Running Noodles. - Running Noodles.

1195
00:45:01,802 --> 00:45:04,370
We're shooting Running Noodles now.

1196
00:45:04,371 --> 00:45:05,770
Running Noodles.

1197
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:07,770
(They still haven't given up completely.)

1198
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:08,870
Noodles.

1199
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,110
(They arrive at a convenience store.)

1200
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,705
We're here.

1201
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,780
So Min, do you want to go in alone?

1202
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:16,610
(For a change)

1203
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:18,550
- So Min, try it again. - Try it again.

1204
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,780
(1 unlucky person is better than 3.)

1205
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:21,780
- Please bring us a good result. - So Min.

1206
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:23,385
Please.

1207
00:45:23,524 --> 00:45:25,390
(Let me try.)

1208
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:26,460
Please.

1209
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,585
(Let me try.)

1210
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:30,990
Good luck.

1211
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:33,195
(No more noodles.)

1212
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,530
This is just like last time.

1213
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:37,430
(Let me think.)

1214
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:39,030
- Heo Kyeong Hwan... - He went in alone.

1215
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,670
asked a convenience store clerk,

1216
00:45:40,674 --> 00:45:42,935
- and she said ramen. - Ramen.

1217
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:46,080
(Kyeong Hwan went into a convenience store alone...)

1218
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,040
(and asked the clerk.)

1219
00:45:48,048 --> 00:45:51,945
(Ramen)

1220
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:57,220
(The situation is similar.)

1221
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:58,390
Excuse me.

1222
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,290
(If the clerk recommends steaks, the mission is complete.)

1223
00:46:01,295 --> 00:46:02,915
Here.

1224
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:05,930
Your favorite food...

1225
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,660
(Is it noodles again?)

1226
00:46:07,668 --> 00:46:08,760
One dish.

1227
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:11,925
(Or will they finally have steaks?)

1228
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:13,935
Please.

1229
00:46:14,308 --> 00:46:15,570
So Min is talking to him.

1230
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:17,270
- We have to get out of here. - She's talking to him.

1231
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:19,835
- No more noodles. - So Min is talking to him.

1232
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,005
Please.

1233
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,745
How does her face look?

1234
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:26,045
- I can't see it. - You can't?

1235
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,250
It can't be wantanmien again.

1236
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:30,090
No way.

1237
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:33,215
All the wantanmien places are closing down right now.

1238
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,020
What's your choice?

1239
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:37,625
(The clerk finally decides on the dish.)

1240
00:46:38,098 --> 00:46:40,730
(Let me write it down for you.)

1241
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:42,900
(If it's steaks, the mission is complete.)

1242
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:45,330
(If not, they have to eat the food and try again.)

1243
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:47,135
Her eyes became so big.

1244
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:48,700
Her eyes became so big.

1245
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:51,005
It must be something new.

1246
00:46:51,311 --> 00:46:52,710
Please.

1247
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:54,875
- Here she comes. - She's coming out.

1248
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,150
So Min.

1249
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,650
- Jae Seok. - What did he say?

1250
00:46:58,652 --> 00:46:59,920
Is it something good? She's laughing.

1251
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,620
(So Min is just laughing.)

1252
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:03,320
You looked surprised.

1253
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:04,920
What is it?

1254
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,755
Stop it.

1255
00:47:07,027 --> 00:47:08,890
(It doesn't feel right.)

1256
00:47:08,896 --> 00:47:10,730
Stop it.

1257
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:12,530
Be quiet.

1258
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:13,600
Jae Seok.

1259
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,495
I'm going home.

1260
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:19,700
(What does it mean?)

1261
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:22,370
- What is it? - The clerk wrote it down.

1262
00:47:22,376 --> 00:47:23,965
- What is it? - Last time...

1263
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,310
(What did the clerk write?)

1264
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:28,610
- Fishball noodles? - Fishball noodles?

1265
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:31,005
(Fishball noodles?)

1266
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:33,815
(Fishball noodles?)

1267
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:37,520
(Noodles again?)

1268
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:40,360
(Noodles for the 4th time in a row?)

1269
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,760
- It's noodles. - Is it different from wantanmien?

1270
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:44,225
- It's noodles again. - Fishball noodles.

1271
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:49,430
(The clerk kindly writes down the name of the food.)

1272
00:47:49,436 --> 00:47:51,300
(So Min can't take her eyes off.)

1273
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:52,500
(I recommend it.)

1274
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:54,700
- Noodles? - Yes.

1275
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,210
(Hold on.)

1276
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,965
(It says, "noodles".)

1277
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:01,680
(Dizzy)

1278
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,280
What am I going to say to the guys?

1279
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:05,810
(Worried)

1280
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,920
Think about it.

1281
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:11,285
In Japan, Kyeong Hwan went into a convenience store,

1282
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,390
and the clerk wrote down the name of the food.

1283
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:14,690
It was ramen.

1284
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,990
At that time, it was either soba or ramen.

1285
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,455
But this time, it's wantanmien every time.

1286
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,800
Only wantanmien.

1287
00:48:21,802 --> 00:48:23,625
- I mean... - All right.

1288
00:48:23,804 --> 00:48:25,000
(3 wantanmiens in a row)

1289
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,370
All right. Running Noodles.

1290
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:29,070
Running Noodles.

1291
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,970
The noodle trap.

1292
00:48:30,978 --> 00:48:32,470
The second part.

1293
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:34,810
Last time, we were in Japan. And now we're in Hong Kong.

1294
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,280
We're the hosts this time too.

1295
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,680
- We're having our 3rd wantanmien. - Our 3rd wantanmien.

1296
00:48:39,686 --> 00:48:41,120
Let's go.

1297
00:48:41,121 --> 00:48:43,075
- Running Noodles! - Running Noodles!

1298
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:45,190
- Running Noodles. - Are we really doing it?

1299
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:47,220
- I can't believe it. - Seriously?

1300
00:48:47,227 --> 00:48:48,990
Gosh. Let's go.

1301
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:50,630
(Already full of noodles, they find a fishball noodles place.)

1302
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:51,960
It's our third noodles.

1303
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:53,925
I can't eat anymore.

1304
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:57,795
- Me neither. - We're not going to succeed.

1305
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:00,035
After eating here,

1306
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,035
we'll have to ask the staff...

1307
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:04,040
to get us out of this area.

1308
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:05,410
I want to go far away.

1309
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:07,540
There's a famous night market around this area.

1310
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:08,540
- Mong Kok night market? - Yes.

1311
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:09,880
Isn't this the night market?

1312
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:11,750
No. Shall we go there?

1313
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:13,780
They have various types of food...

1314
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:15,715
- including steak. - Let's go somewhere else.

1315
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,590
A touristy place.

1316
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:18,890
- Let's go to a place like that. - Right.

1317
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:21,320
Many people are eating noodles.

1318
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:23,890
- Everyone is eating noodles. - Wantanmien is...

1319
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:26,185
- very famous in Hong Kong. - It must be their staple food.

1320
00:49:26,266 --> 00:49:28,300
(People in Hong Kong love noodles.)

1321
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:32,525
(It's their soul food as it's simple and satisfying.)

1322
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,035
(Fishball noodles are made with taut fish cakes and rice noodles.)

1323
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:40,680
Let's search wantanmien in Hong Kong.

1324
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:44,110
When we got off for the third time...

1325
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:45,410
- I was surprised. - Seriously.

1326
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:47,050
I wanted to cry.

1327
00:49:47,054 --> 00:49:50,585
- Wantanmien is famous. - I told you.

1328
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:53,320
Wantanmien is famous in Hong Kong.

1329
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,860
- Why don't people mention dim sum? - I know.

1330
00:49:55,862 --> 00:50:00,400
In Hong Kong, dim sum also means lunch.

1331
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,830
- People recommend it for lunch. - They eat it for lunch.

1332
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,030
They don't recommend it for dinner.

1333
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,640
It's a simpler meal.

1334
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:12,110
Here are the best five dishes in Hong Kong.

1335
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,340
Number one, dim sum.

1336
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:14,410
What's number two?

1337
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:16,280
See? Dim sum is for lunch.

1338
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:17,780
Number two is wantanmien.

1339
00:50:17,784 --> 00:50:19,180
(I knew it.)

1340
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:20,420
What's number three?

1341
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,450
Food is here.

1342
00:50:21,455 --> 00:50:24,550
(Food is served with shocking news.)

1343
00:50:24,558 --> 00:50:26,050
It's a lot.

1344
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,755
It's a game of loyalty.

1345
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:29,560
(Their loyalty to noodles starts again.)

1346
00:50:29,563 --> 00:50:32,630
- This much is enough. - You should eat more.

1347
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:35,095
- Take some more. - I can smell it.

1348
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:36,570
Hey.

1349
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,930
(Piling up)

1350
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:40,295
My stomach is about to burst.

1351
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:41,900
We have to eat it.

1352
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:44,605
- Gosh. - This is interesting.

1353
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:47,080
Does it taste different?

1354
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,310
Aren't there any toppings?

1355
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:50,180
- It's different from the last one. - How is it?

1356
00:50:50,183 --> 00:50:51,750
The broth color is different.

1357
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:53,220
- It's like beef bone broth. - It's completely different.

1358
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,050
- Do you mean the taste? - The taste is different.

1359
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,350
- Are these called fish balls? - It's fish cake.

1360
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:58,885
It's fish cake.

1361
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,660
- It's fish cake. - Let me try it.

1362
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:03,115
(How are fish balls different?)

1363
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:08,025
It tastes like...

1364
00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:09,430
fish cakes.

1365
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,095
(He makes an obvious statement.)

1366
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,930
We're in Hong Kong.

1367
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,370
Why are we only eating noodles?

1368
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:15,500
(He's getting annoyed.)

1369
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:17,905
You should have asked better.

1370
00:51:19,112 --> 00:51:21,610
Why didn't you ask more carefully?

1371
00:51:21,615 --> 00:51:24,675
(He's not content.)

1372
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:27,380
These are similar to udon noodles.

1373
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:29,380
There's nothing I like about you.

1374
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,315
(Forget it. There's nothing I like about you.)

1375
00:51:33,493 --> 00:51:36,190
(There he goes again.)

1376
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:37,760
He's blaming me.

1377
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:40,960
I wanted to get closer to you in Hong Kong.

1378
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,000
My goodness.

1379
00:51:42,002 --> 00:51:43,100
Seok Jin.

1380
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:44,730
(I'm 53 years old.)

1381
00:51:44,738 --> 00:51:46,525
These are delicious.

1382
00:51:46,907 --> 00:51:48,535
The broth is good too.

1383
00:51:48,642 --> 00:51:50,270
It tastes like rice noodles.

1384
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:52,135
(It's still tasty.)

1385
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:53,780
We finished.

1386
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,335
That was our third noodle dish.

1387
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,320
(Unhappy)

1388
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,450
- I'm tired. - Look at the time.

1389
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:05,245
- My stomach is so full. - It's 9pm.

1390
00:52:05,258 --> 00:52:08,120
Why don't we leave this neighborhood?

1391
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,930
- Please. - Let's go somewhere else.

1392
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,490
Let's go to the city center.

1393
00:52:11,498 --> 00:52:13,955
- Let's go somewhere else. - This neighborhood...

1394
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,730
Seok Jin did some research...

1395
00:52:16,737 --> 00:52:18,500
on the Internet.

1396
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,100
This place is famous for wantanmien.

1397
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:22,140
- It's famous here. - It's a famous street.

1398
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:23,910
- Is it number two? - It's second most popular food...

1399
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:25,710
- Many people eat wantanmien. - among people in Hong Kong...

1400
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,010
- It's wantanmien. - is wantanmien.

1401
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:29,510
- I didn't know. It's dim sum. - What was number one?

1402
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:32,080
Dim sum is usually eaten for lunch.

1403
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:34,480
We'll go to a different place.

1404
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:35,950
- Okay. - Let's go to the car.

1405
00:52:35,956 --> 00:52:37,750
- Let's go. - Let's go to the city.

1406
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:39,990
- We'll leave this neighborhood. - Let's go far.

1407
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,190
Restaurants are starting to close.

1408
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:43,960
- They're closed. - Right?

1409
00:52:43,964 --> 00:52:47,160
I hope they'll close earlier than later.

1410
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:49,300
- Hurry. - Let's go.

1411
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,570
Let's go.

1412
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,270
(They move in a hurry.)

1413
00:52:53,273 --> 00:52:55,995
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1414
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:59,165
Is there a way to lead them to steak?

1415
00:52:59,312 --> 00:53:01,080
What about wear a T-shirt...

1416
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,205
that has a steak on it?

1417
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:04,780
A steak printed on it.

1418
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:06,750
- If there's one, we should buy it. - I know.

1419
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:10,585
- We need steak t-shirts. - Right.

1420
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:12,420
Do whatever it takes.

1421
00:53:12,426 --> 00:53:15,390
It's time for people in Hong Kong to turn out the lights and sleep.

1422
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:17,390
How will we get food?

1423
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:18,530
I know.

1424
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:21,300
Parental guidance is advised for viewers under the age of 12.

1425
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:25,300
(She says it all of a sudden.)

1426
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:27,240
- Be quiet. - What is she doing?

1427
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,500
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

1428
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:31,010
This is what I wish.

1429
00:53:31,011 --> 00:53:33,440
After 7pm,

1430
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,940
it changes to viewers under the age of 15...

1431
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:37,050
during the shoot.

1432
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,080
(What is she saying?)

1433
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:39,110
- During the shoot? - Yes.

1434
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:41,550
I think you should be on a show...

1435
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:43,120
that's aired after midnight.

1436
00:53:43,123 --> 00:53:45,250
- She'd be good at it. - Right.

1437
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:48,085
Your acrostic poem with "Haha" was fun.

1438
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:51,060
(While selecting her partner)

1439
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,060
(Haha, you're very sexy.)

1440
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:55,500
(Breathing hard)

1441
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:58,030
(It's not for viewers under the age of 12.)

1442
00:53:58,038 --> 00:54:02,770
(She surprised everyone then.)

1443
00:54:02,776 --> 00:54:05,710
That was for age over 12. If the age was 15,

1444
00:54:05,712 --> 00:54:07,240
- Would it be different? - it'd be different.

1445
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,440
How would you do it?

1446
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:10,410
- Ha. - Since the age was 12,

1447
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,310
I did this. If it were 15,

1448
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,880
I'd do this.

1449
00:54:13,887 --> 00:54:16,175
(She sticks out her tongue.)

1450
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,790
(Here is promiscuous So Min.)

1451
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:20,190
My goodness.

1452
00:54:20,193 --> 00:54:22,590
She's so annoying.

1453
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:23,790
Look at you.

1454
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:25,330
It's different if the age limit is 19.

1455
00:54:25,332 --> 00:54:26,600
- Stop it. - What is it?

1456
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,600
Stop it.

1457
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:30,830
(I won't hurt you.)

1458
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:32,500
What should I do with So Min?

1459
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:34,240
(We love Jeon So Min. Late night show, let's go.)

1460
00:54:34,241 --> 00:54:36,770
She's slowly getting loose.

1461
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:39,135
Isn't she?

1462
00:54:39,513 --> 00:54:42,210
- Look at the night view. - It's beautiful.

1463
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:44,310
- It's amazing. - It's beautiful.

1464
00:54:44,317 --> 00:54:46,310
It's a priceless night view.

1465
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:48,220
It's famous for its night view.

1466
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:50,390
It's really amazing.

1467
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:52,050
- Goodness. - Look at this.

1468
00:54:52,058 --> 00:54:53,660
- It's great. - This is a great place.

1469
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:54,820
It's a perfect place for steak.

1470
00:54:54,828 --> 00:54:56,460
There's a steak restaurant.

1471
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:57,860
Here's a steak restaurant.

1472
00:54:57,864 --> 00:54:59,030
(He gets excited.)

1473
00:54:59,032 --> 00:55:00,795
It's written "Steakhouse".

1474
00:55:01,601 --> 00:55:03,160
(His tone rises.)

1475
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:04,830
- Seok Jin, lower your voice. - I'm sorry.

1476
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:06,330
I'm sorry, but I got excited.

1477
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:08,700
How could I not get excited when there's a steakhouse?

1478
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:09,700
Here it is.

1479
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,410
What if we ask in front of it?

1480
00:55:11,411 --> 00:55:12,970
This is the street.

1481
00:55:12,979 --> 00:55:14,710
(We may clear the mission.)

1482
00:55:14,714 --> 00:55:16,710
- It's beautiful. - This is the street.

1483
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:23,920
(Stars whisper on the night street in Hong Kong)

1484
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:26,760
(They're the most excited they have been in Hong Kong.)

1485
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,320
- How do you know this song? - I do.

1486
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,320
How?

1487
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:32,660
(After a long bus ride, they arrive at Mong Kok Night Market.)

1488
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:34,000
Look how bright it is.

1489
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,500
It's starting now.

1490
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:37,470
- It's like during the day. - It starts during the day.

1491
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,600
It's like during the day.

1492
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:40,170
(Mong Kok Night Market)

1493
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:41,200
Hello.

1494
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:44,910
It's the most popuar Mong Kok Night Market in Hong Kong.

1495
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:45,970
I know.

1496
00:55:45,979 --> 00:55:48,640
You will give it a try again.

1497
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:50,405
Goodness.

1498
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:52,580
- Spin it, Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

1499
00:55:52,586 --> 00:55:55,050
(He spins the roulette.)

1500
00:55:55,055 --> 00:55:58,190
(Who will be the one to recommend?)

1501
00:55:58,191 --> 00:55:59,550
Someone whose last name is Wang.

1502
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,620
- That's good. - Someone whose last name is Wang.

1503
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:03,755
- Wang. - Let's go over there.

1504
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:05,830
We should ask people's names.

1505
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:09,495
This is a touristy place.

1506
00:56:09,836 --> 00:56:12,530
Mong Kok Night Market is a touristy spot.

1507
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,700
It must be a famous place.

1508
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,910
- It's a night market. - Is this it?

1509
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,410
Doesn't it look fun, So Min?

1510
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:19,940
- Yes, it looks fun. - Is it your first time?

1511
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:22,340
I've never been here before either.

1512
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:23,780
There are a lot of things.

1513
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:25,350
- Look. - I want to look around.

1514
00:56:25,352 --> 00:56:26,450
Goodness.

1515
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,415
- Don't you want to shop? - Yes.

1516
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,915
Is there anyone whose last name is Wang?

1517
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:33,090
I heard that there are many.

1518
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:34,460
Really?

1519
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:37,530
How will we ask someone whose last name is Wang?

1520
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,960
Asking will be hard.

1521
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:40,000
(How should we ask?)

1522
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,430
- Shall we ask? - How do we ask...

1523
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:43,430
- for people's names? - We should ask people's names.

1524
00:56:43,436 --> 00:56:44,430
(They learn how to ask.)

1525
00:56:44,437 --> 00:56:45,600
Pardon?

1526
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:47,300
(Stammering)

1527
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:50,370
(What is your last name?)

1528
00:56:50,377 --> 00:56:55,540
(They go to a wider road than a small alleyway.)

1529
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:57,510
- How about him? - Let's ask him.

1530
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:58,950
(Shall we ask him?)

1531
00:56:58,952 --> 00:57:01,050
(They ask the first local person.)

1532
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:02,380
Let's ask him.

1533
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:04,590
- Excuse me. - Excuse me.

1534
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,250
What is your last name?

1535
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:08,720
- What? - What is your last name?

1536
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:13,060
(How will he respond to their first question?)

1537
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:16,970
(My last name is...)

1538
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:18,670
My last name is Lei.

1539
00:57:18,672 --> 00:57:20,100
- "Lei"? - "Lei"?

1540
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:22,200
(Of course it is.)

1541
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:25,510
(What about the man next to her?)

1542
00:57:25,512 --> 00:57:27,710
(His last name is Zhang.)

1543
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:30,180
(Neither of their last name is Wang.)

1544
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:31,680
- He's Mr. Zhang. - Zhang?

1545
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:34,115
(Thank you for answering.)

1546
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,980
Didn't they say that there are many Wang's?

1547
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:37,790
That's what I heard.

1548
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,490
(Among the crowd, who has Wang as their last name?)

1549
00:57:40,493 --> 00:57:43,690
Excuse me.

1550
00:57:43,697 --> 00:57:46,185
What is your last name?

1551
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,130
What is your last name?

1552
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:49,460
My last name?

1553
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,700
It's Tan.

1554
00:57:50,704 --> 00:57:53,465
Tan? Tan.

1555
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,095
Lao? Thank you.

1556
00:57:56,443 --> 00:57:59,270
They are not the ones.

1557
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:00,540
(It isn't easy.)

1558
00:58:00,547 --> 00:58:01,640
Thank you.

1559
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:03,280
- Aren't they Wang? - No.

1560
00:58:03,283 --> 00:58:05,280
Her last name was Tan.

1561
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:07,120
(Wang sounds similar to Korean.)

1562
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,780
What is your last name?

1563
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:11,450
(They'll recognize it once they hear it.)

1564
00:58:11,458 --> 00:58:13,390
- Lan? - Lan.

1565
00:58:13,393 --> 00:58:15,115
What's your last name?

1566
00:58:15,295 --> 00:58:16,360
Tung.

1567
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:18,130
- Tung? - I see.

1568
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:20,200
- Thank you. - Thank you for your answer.

1569
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,800
(They fail again.)

1570
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:23,230
It's difficult.

1571
00:58:23,236 --> 00:58:25,300
- It's hard to find. - There's a variety of last names.

1572
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:26,865
How about her?

1573
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:29,200
- What's your last name? - What's your last name?

1574
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:30,510
It's Tung.

1575
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,610
- "Tung"? - That's not it.

1576
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:33,710
What is your name?

1577
00:58:33,713 --> 00:58:35,040
It's Isaac Lim.

1578
00:58:35,048 --> 00:58:36,610
- Lim. - "Lim"?

1579
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:38,150
What is your last name?

1580
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:39,750
(Wang is impossible to find.)

1581
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:40,820
Okay.

1582
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,350
- Zhi. - What's your last name?

1583
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:43,985
Cheon?

1584
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:46,990
- There's no one named Wang. - Hello.

1585
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:48,420
What is your last name?

1586
00:58:48,428 --> 00:58:50,585
It's Wong.

1587
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:54,160
- Wang? - Wang?

1588
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,160
(Is his last name Wang?)

1589
00:58:56,169 --> 00:58:58,000
- Wang? - W, o, n, g.

1590
00:58:58,004 --> 00:58:59,330
W, a, n, g?

1591
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,600
- W, o, n, g. - W, o, n, g?

1592
00:59:01,608 --> 00:59:03,665
Is it correct?

1593
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,140
(Wong is also correct.)

1594
00:59:06,146 --> 00:59:07,410
We have to say this.

1595
00:59:07,413 --> 00:59:11,410
(They found him! It's time to get a menu recommendation.)

1596
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:15,350
(They're in Mong Kok and hope to succeed the mission.)

1597
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:19,620
(What menu does Mr. Wong recommend?)

1598
00:59:19,626 --> 00:59:24,355
(Is it steak this time?)

1599
00:59:25,632 --> 00:59:27,830
(He recommends...)

1600
00:59:30,003 --> 00:59:34,007
(They found him! It's time to get a menu recommendation.)

1601
00:59:34,007 --> 00:59:37,944
(They're in Mong Kok and hope to succeed the mission.)

1602
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:42,215
(What menu does Mr. Wong recommend?)

1603
00:59:42,215 --> 00:59:46,953
(Is it steak this time?)

1604
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:50,423
(He recommends...)

1605
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:54,794
(Taiwanese noodles.)

1606
00:59:55,195 --> 00:59:57,964
(Noodles again?)

1607
00:59:57,964 --> 01:00:00,567
(Oh, dear.)

1608
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:04,671
Taiwanese noodles? Okay.

1609
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,674
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1610
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:08,675
(It's noodles again.)

1611
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:11,010
It's noodles again.

1612
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,280
(They didn't even get close to steak since they got to Hong Kong.)

1613
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,652
(They've been around noodles the whole time.)

1614
01:00:20,086 --> 01:00:22,689
(Again?)

1615
01:00:22,689 --> 01:00:24,891
(Yes, again.)

1616
01:00:24,891 --> 01:00:28,094
(They couldn't get away from noodles.)

1617
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:31,598
(You can't be eliminated even if you wish to.)

1618
01:00:31,598 --> 01:00:35,468
(They had three bowls of noodles.)

1619
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:36,936
(Taiwan noodles is their fourth.)

1620
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:39,372
- There's meat this time. - Thank you.

1621
01:00:39,505 --> 01:00:41,341
- It's red. - Hello. Thank you.

1622
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:43,476
- Beef noodles? - Thank you.

1623
01:00:43,476 --> 01:00:45,678
Right. I like how red it is.

1624
01:00:45,678 --> 01:00:47,146
- This... - It's different.

1625
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:49,749
- is still... - It's Taiwanese style, right?

1626
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:51,417
It's thick.

1627
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:52,952
(The noodles are really thick.)

1628
01:00:52,952 --> 01:00:55,521
(That was a surprise.)

1629
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:59,092
- It's thick. - I see the noodles.

1630
01:00:59,092 --> 01:01:01,861
I knew, but I looked just in case.

1631
01:01:01,861 --> 01:01:03,663
There's so much noodles.

1632
01:01:03,663 --> 01:01:05,498
There are carrots and meat.

1633
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:08,735
The carrots and meat make it look like...

1634
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:10,770
- Those noodles... - the noodles in Okinawa.

1635
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:12,272
They look like those noodles.

1636
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:14,407
This looks like the noodles in Okinawa.

1637
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:17,076
Noodles in Okinawa had meat.

1638
01:01:17,076 --> 01:01:18,845
Well...

1639
01:01:19,178 --> 01:01:22,682
Should I try the meat? There are dumplings.

1640
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:26,686
(Hold on. Are these dumplings?)

1641
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:28,087
Thank you.

1642
01:01:28,087 --> 01:01:31,224
For free? It's not necessary.

1643
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:33,126
(Goodness, she doesn't have to.)

1644
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:35,662
- We had too many. - She doesn't have to do that.

1645
01:01:35,662 --> 01:01:36,763
(Hong Kong people are too nice, so they don't know what to do.)

1646
01:01:36,763 --> 01:01:39,132
- I'm too full. - There's so much to eat.

1647
01:01:39,132 --> 01:01:40,466
(They have noodles plus the dumplings.)

1648
01:01:40,466 --> 01:01:42,035
- She didn't have to do that. - I'm too full.

1649
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,369
My stomach is about to explode.

1650
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,239
- I feel drunk. - We keep eating.

1651
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,374
(They have to finish the noodles fast.)

1652
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:50,677
- Thank you for the food. - I'll have this.

1653
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:53,980
(They feast on flour, carbohydrate, and protein at night.)

1654
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,316
You're having as much noodles as you want.

1655
01:01:56,316 --> 01:01:57,784
This tastes like the noodles in Okinawa.

1656
01:01:57,784 --> 01:01:59,452
- Does it? - Really?

1657
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:03,790
(They reminisce the old memory and slurp on the noodles.)

1658
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,392
(It's clean.)

1659
01:02:06,392 --> 01:02:08,494
That was good.

1660
01:02:08,494 --> 01:02:10,363
- I'm full, but that was good. - Good.

1661
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:11,364
All right.

1662
01:02:11,364 --> 01:02:12,765
(That was good. Thank you for the food!)

1663
01:02:12,765 --> 01:02:14,300
That was good.

1664
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:16,469
- Bye. - Bye.

1665
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:17,470
(They can't give in. They have to try again before it's too late.)

1666
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,273
- I'm so full. - Where are you going?

1667
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:23,176
(He has to vomit.)

1668
01:02:23,176 --> 01:02:26,012
(The noodles are about to escape.)

1669
01:02:26,913 --> 01:02:28,848
- I... - I can't walk.

1670
01:02:28,848 --> 01:02:32,785
This is so hard. I miss my mom.

1671
01:02:33,052 --> 01:02:35,154
I... Be cautious.

1672
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:38,624
Don't irritate me. If you poke me,

1673
01:02:38,624 --> 01:02:40,660
I'll spit noodles at you.

1674
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,862
I'll spit noodles from my mouth.

1675
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,163
How many bowls did we have?

1676
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:46,499
(They start acting odd after having four bowls.)

1677
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:47,867
Dumplings.

1678
01:02:47,867 --> 01:02:49,335
(Eating one food only is dangerous.)

1679
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:50,837
Dumplings.

1680
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:53,339
It had meat in it.

1681
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:55,108
It wasn't steak, but it was boiled.

1682
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:56,342
(It doesn't even look like steak.)

1683
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:58,077
Do you want one last chance?

1684
01:02:58,077 --> 01:02:59,979
- Yes, please give us a last chance. - Let's do it.

1685
01:02:59,979 --> 01:03:03,683
- Spin this for the last time. - Okay.

1686
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:05,218
- This is our last chance. - Okay.

1687
01:03:05,218 --> 01:03:06,853
This is your last chance.

1688
01:03:06,919 --> 01:03:08,888
- You should spin it. - I will try it.

1689
01:03:08,888 --> 01:03:10,690
I'm sick of this.

1690
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,658
(Can they finally succeed this time?)

1691
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:18,064
(The last person to recommend a menu is...)

1692
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:19,565
- Someone whose last name is Wang. - Wang.

1693
01:03:19,565 --> 01:03:20,833
(It's Wang again.)

1694
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,603
This is our last chance.

1695
01:03:23,636 --> 01:03:25,405
(If they take too long again, they'll be in trouble.)

1696
01:03:25,405 --> 01:03:27,740
Let's go. That way.

1697
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:29,008
(Let's hurry.)

1698
01:03:29,008 --> 01:03:31,077
- Let's look for them. - Okay, let's split up.

1699
01:03:31,077 --> 01:03:32,545
(Where is Wang this late at night?)

1700
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:34,580
Let's split up and look for Wang.

1701
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,581
(Let's split up and look.)

1702
01:03:35,581 --> 01:03:38,484
Hello. Excuse me.

1703
01:03:38,484 --> 01:03:41,854
(Is your last name...)

1704
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,857
(Mine is Liu.)

1705
01:03:44,857 --> 01:03:46,359
You?

1706
01:03:46,359 --> 01:03:48,327
- Mine is Hao. - Hao? I see. Thank you.

1707
01:03:48,327 --> 01:03:51,197
(There is nobody named Wang.)

1708
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:53,733
- What now? - Excuse me. What is your last name?

1709
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:55,368
(It's late, so there's less people and the restaurants are closing.)

1710
01:03:55,368 --> 01:04:00,073
(If they take too long, they will fail the mission.)

1711
01:04:00,073 --> 01:04:01,407
There's nobody.

1712
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:03,943
(Where is Wang?)

1713
01:04:03,943 --> 01:04:05,678
What is your last name?

1714
01:04:05,678 --> 01:04:07,747
Choy?

1715
01:04:07,747 --> 01:04:11,184
(What about the person next to you?)

1716
01:04:11,184 --> 01:04:13,086
- My last name is Wu. - Is that so?

1717
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,487
What is your name?

1718
01:04:14,487 --> 01:04:15,955
It's Wong.

1719
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,558
Are you Wong?

1720
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:19,759
(Are you Wong?)

1721
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:23,262
(Are you really Mr. Wong?)

1722
01:04:23,262 --> 01:04:24,964
(They find a person whose last name is Wong.)

1723
01:04:24,964 --> 01:04:27,533
Is it right? Is he Wong?

1724
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:30,336
Okay, I found him!

1725
01:04:30,336 --> 01:04:32,371
You did? Seok Jin, did you find him?

1726
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,340
I think he found somebody.

1727
01:04:34,373 --> 01:04:36,242
- Did you find a person? - I did. Thank you.

1728
01:04:36,242 --> 01:04:37,743
This is Wong.

1729
01:04:37,844 --> 01:04:40,780
- We'll try for one last time. - We're serious.

1730
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,315
All right!

1731
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:46,352
(A food recommendation? Let's see.)

1732
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:47,920
What menu?

1733
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:51,124
- One. - Best menu.

1734
01:04:51,124 --> 01:04:53,359
(Please recommend one dish.)

1735
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,927
- Tell us. - Please.

1736
01:04:54,927 --> 01:04:58,764
(If he recommends steak, they succeed right away.)

1737
01:04:58,764 --> 01:05:00,867
- Name of the menu? - A menu?

1738
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:01,868
(Mr. Wong is the last person.)

1739
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:04,971
(What does he recommend?)

1740
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:08,975
("Gon Chow Fun"?)

1741
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:13,045
- What's that? - Beef...

1742
01:05:14,313 --> 01:05:16,582
(Beef?)

1743
01:05:16,582 --> 01:05:21,621
(Did he recommend steak?)

1744
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:22,889
Beef fried noodles.

1745
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,424
(Stop dreaming.)

1746
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,094
(They were hopeful for a moment,)

1747
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:30,396
(but he doesn't recommend steak.)

1748
01:05:30,396 --> 01:05:32,765
(Beef what?)

1749
01:05:32,765 --> 01:05:33,766
Thank you.

1750
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:36,369
(Is this for real?)

1751
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:38,137
- Beef. - Really?

1752
01:05:38,137 --> 01:05:40,339
- Beef fried noodles. - Beef fried...

1753
01:05:40,339 --> 01:05:41,774
- Is it noodles? - Fried noodles?

1754
01:05:41,774 --> 01:05:43,943
- It's noodles, right? - Is that what he said?

1755
01:05:43,943 --> 01:05:45,178
- Sir. - Where's the restaurant?

1756
01:05:45,178 --> 01:05:47,480
I don't think that's what he said. He didn't say noodles.

1757
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,382
I'm serious. It's in Cantonese.

1758
01:05:49,382 --> 01:05:50,883
Is it beef fried noodles?

1759
01:05:50,883 --> 01:05:53,753
Why do Hong Kong people love noodles?

1760
01:05:53,753 --> 01:05:55,121
I'm sorry!

1761
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:56,522
(I'm sorry, Producer!)

1762
01:05:56,522 --> 01:05:59,292
- Stop this! - I can't eat no more.

1763
01:05:59,292 --> 01:06:01,394
Let's just say we failed.

1764
01:06:01,394 --> 01:06:03,930
- We'll stop eating noodles. - Please send us home.

1765
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:05,364
- Goodness. - Don't do this.

1766
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:08,734
Mister. Mr. Producer. Please let us stop eating.

1767
01:06:08,734 --> 01:06:10,870
- We can't eat anymore. - Please.

1768
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:13,239
- We can't eat. - Let's just say we failed.

1769
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:14,874
We can't have beef fried noodles.

1770
01:06:14,874 --> 01:06:18,344
All right. Your failed...

1771
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:21,981
your mission today. From nine people,

1772
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:23,783
at least one person has to get the punishment.

1773
01:06:23,783 --> 01:06:24,984
That's a relief.

1774
01:06:24,984 --> 01:06:27,320
- 1 in 9 people? - There are ballots.

1775
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,222
- That's not bad. - That's fine.

1776
01:06:29,222 --> 01:06:31,624
- It might not be us. - We can vote for one person.

1777
01:06:31,624 --> 01:06:33,326
Let's give our votes to one person.

1778
01:06:33,326 --> 01:06:35,928
- That's right. - To end this off,

1779
01:06:35,928 --> 01:06:38,931
let's eat beef fried noodles and conclude today's mission.

1780
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:40,333
How do we eat more?

1781
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:43,703
We tried to get away, but it's noodles again.

1782
01:06:44,103 --> 01:06:45,104
(What?)

1783
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:47,273
They sell steak?

1784
01:06:47,273 --> 01:06:48,608
- Where? - They sell steak here.

1785
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:50,543
They sell steak.

1786
01:06:50,943 --> 01:06:52,511
Look.

1787
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,614
- This is it. - There's steak.

1788
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,781
There are so many.

1789
01:06:55,781 --> 01:06:58,284
This is a steakhouse.

1790
01:06:58,284 --> 01:07:00,419
They are open.

1791
01:07:00,419 --> 01:07:02,588
This was our last chance.

1792
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:04,590
Let me loosen the mic and go in.

1793
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:05,658
(Excuse me.)

1794
01:07:05,658 --> 01:07:07,660
People are watching.

1795
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:09,161
(She reached her limit.)

1796
01:07:09,662 --> 01:07:11,464
Finished?

1797
01:07:11,464 --> 01:07:13,532
Not finished?

1798
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,668
- Are they closed? - That was so funny.

1799
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:18,504
Seok Jin asked if they were closed and they said,

1800
01:07:18,504 --> 01:07:19,839
"Not finished".

1801
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:22,208
(We're open for business.)

1802
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:24,944
I would have been happy if they were closed.

1803
01:07:24,944 --> 01:07:26,746
Thank you.

1804
01:07:26,746 --> 01:07:28,414
(At the steakhouse, they have beef fried noodles.)

1805
01:07:28,414 --> 01:07:30,116
This smells good.

1806
01:07:30,116 --> 01:07:32,485
This is a noodles trip.

1807
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,890
(Meanwhile, at a cottage in Gangwon Province)

1808
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:41,661
(Team Ji Hyo and Si Young are both staying here.)

1809
01:07:41,827 --> 01:07:44,463
(Team Ji Hyo prepared meals for 100 people.)

1810
01:07:44,463 --> 01:07:47,466
(They'e exhausted.)

1811
01:07:47,466 --> 01:07:49,302
I'm very...

1812
01:07:49,302 --> 01:07:51,270
worn out.

1813
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,105
We're filthy.

1814
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:56,609
I didn't know preparing 100 servings was this hard.

1815
01:07:56,609 --> 01:07:57,977
(It feels like they aged 100 more years.)

1816
01:07:57,977 --> 01:08:00,813
How will Haha react? Will he be surprised?

1817
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:02,315
- He will be, right? - Of course.

1818
01:08:02,315 --> 01:08:05,484
- He'll be shocked. - He will be.

1819
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:08,754
I was extremely careful.

1820
01:08:08,754 --> 01:08:12,625
There's a chatroom in our agency where our schedules get posted.

1821
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:14,560
I posted it...

1822
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,363
as a meeting for my concert.

1823
01:08:17,363 --> 01:08:22,501
Because he might ask where I'm going.

1824
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,003
I had to come up with something.

1825
01:08:24,003 --> 01:08:25,738
- How meticulous. - Right.

1826
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:29,375
(She's a perfect secret guest.)

1827
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:31,811
(Team Si Young returns after completing their mission.)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1828
01:08:31,811 --> 01:08:33,145
I think they're here.

1829
01:08:33,145 --> 01:08:34,814
(Haha and his team are here.)

1830
01:08:36,182 --> 01:08:38,417
(He's tired.)

1831
01:08:38,417 --> 01:08:41,787
(Haha has no idea Byul is here.)

1832
01:08:41,787 --> 01:08:43,456
He's here.

1833
01:08:44,023 --> 01:08:45,124
Jong Kook.

1834
01:08:45,124 --> 01:08:46,158
(How will Haha react?)

1835
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:47,793
- Welcome back. - What's going on?

1836
01:08:49,228 --> 01:08:50,830
(What's going on?)

1837
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:53,265
(Welcome, honey.)

1838
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:55,801
(It's me, Go Eun.)

1839
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:57,236
Why?

1840
01:08:57,236 --> 01:08:59,805
(Why are you here?)

1841
01:08:59,805 --> 01:09:01,006
Hello.

1842
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:02,141
She's our guest.

1843
01:09:02,141 --> 01:09:03,843
She's today's guest. Why?

1844
01:09:03,976 --> 01:09:05,778
(He freezes on the spot as well.)

1845
01:09:05,778 --> 01:09:07,046
Hello.

1846
01:09:07,046 --> 01:09:08,314
Really?

1847
01:09:08,314 --> 01:09:09,882
She worked so hard.

1848
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:11,050
- I'm a celebrity. - Hey.

1849
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,651
That's not what I meant.

1850
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:13,886
- I'm a celebrity. - Hey.

1851
01:09:13,886 --> 01:09:15,688
(Long time no see, Mrs. Ha.)

1852
01:09:15,688 --> 01:09:17,623
I can be on the show too!

1853
01:09:17,723 --> 01:09:20,192
I can be on Running Man too.

1854
01:09:20,259 --> 01:09:22,728
- She worked really hard today. - I did. Come here.

1855
01:09:22,728 --> 01:09:24,997
- Comfort her. Massage her. - Give her a hug.

1856
01:09:24,997 --> 01:09:26,932
It's so nice to see you.

1857
01:09:26,932 --> 01:09:29,101
Why... I didn't...

1858
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:31,170
- Hello. - You didn't tell me on purpose.

1859
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,505
- Hello. - Hello.

1860
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:34,240
You didn't... Goodness.

1861
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:36,375
I'm getting goosebumps. You...

1862
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:38,310
Give her a hug.

1863
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:39,612
Great work.

1864
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:41,480
What happened?

1865
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:44,150
- I... - How did this...

1866
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,551
She's separate from you.

1867
01:09:45,551 --> 01:09:46,952
That's not what I mean.

1868
01:09:46,952 --> 01:09:48,554
I got goosebumps.

1869
01:09:48,754 --> 01:09:50,289
How did this happen?

1870
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,425
They had a guest?

1871
01:09:52,425 --> 01:09:54,493
Since we're on the topic,

1872
01:09:54,493 --> 01:09:56,862
can I check your jackets in the corner?

1873
01:09:56,862 --> 01:09:58,063
Me? Mine?

1874
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,665
Both of you.

1875
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,836
- Are you doubting me? - No.

1876
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:06,338
If you keep doubting me, I'll be hurt.

1877
01:10:06,338 --> 01:10:07,339
(Si Young's ballots disappeared.)

1878
01:10:07,339 --> 01:10:10,075
I'm sorry if I'm mistaken.

1879
01:10:10,075 --> 01:10:11,544
(She has a hunch, but there is no evidence.)

1880
01:10:11,877 --> 01:10:13,212
Me? Mine?

1881
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:14,447
Both of you.

1882
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:16,015
Did she hit you?

1883
01:10:16,449 --> 01:10:17,983
They stole your ballots.

1884
01:10:17,983 --> 01:10:20,052
This is a real situation.

1885
01:10:20,052 --> 01:10:22,755
- I got offended. - Why?

1886
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:24,723
I'll show you my jacket.

1887
01:10:25,224 --> 01:10:26,926
We didn't vote yet.

1888
01:10:26,926 --> 01:10:29,295
Don't worry about me.

1889
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:30,496
I'll check for five minutes.

1890
01:10:30,496 --> 01:10:31,831
This is a real situation.

1891
01:10:31,831 --> 01:10:33,232
- This team... - She's investigating.

1892
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:35,034
She's investigating.

1893
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:38,070
(I'll catch you!)

1894
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,605
What happened?

1895
01:10:39,605 --> 01:10:41,640
- We did it. - We succeeded.

1896
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:44,310
We worked so hard.

1897
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:46,145
Our feelings were hurt.

1898
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:47,279
I know.

1899
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:48,948
(You saw her style, right?)

1900
01:10:48,948 --> 01:10:50,616
We couldn't trust each other.

1901
01:10:50,616 --> 01:10:53,152
This was the toughest episode of the year.

1902
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:55,955
- Are you looking for something? - What is that?

1903
01:10:56,322 --> 01:10:57,790
There's nothing, right?

1904
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,191
Wait. Hold on.

1905
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:01,060
I'm worried you'll steal mine.

1906
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,429
Kwang Soo probably did it.

1907
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:05,030
I'm hurt.

1908
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:07,366
I'm very hurt in this situation.

1909
01:11:07,366 --> 01:11:09,235
- Si Young. - Yes?

1910
01:11:09,235 --> 01:11:11,570
Kwang Soo hides in his body.

1911
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,372
- You didn't check his head, right? - He doesn't hide in his clothes.

1912
01:11:13,372 --> 01:11:14,607
No, I didn't.

1913
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,709
Look. You can look.

1914
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:18,210
She looked everywhere.

1915
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:19,578
Look at the back of this head.

1916
01:11:19,578 --> 01:11:22,014
- His hips. - You have to check his head.

1917
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:24,416
He has long hair for a reason.

1918
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:26,619
(You can search.)

1919
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:27,887
She looked everywhere.

1920
01:11:27,887 --> 01:11:28,921
(I'll help.)

1921
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:29,989
(She's an expert when it comes to his stealing.)

1922
01:11:29,989 --> 01:11:31,090
Check the back of his head.

1923
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,125
(She's been on Running Man for 8 years.)

1924
01:11:33,993 --> 01:11:36,262
(Kwang Soo, is this it?)

1925
01:11:36,262 --> 01:11:37,830
Please.

1926
01:11:38,564 --> 01:11:40,199
(I'll give you one.)

1927
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,434
It's really not me. You can rip it.

1928
01:11:42,434 --> 01:11:46,405
(I got you.)

1929
01:11:47,306 --> 01:11:49,008
No way!

1930
01:11:49,008 --> 01:11:50,209
No way.

1931
01:11:50,209 --> 01:11:51,544
It's not me!

1932
01:11:51,544 --> 01:11:54,413
(They don't know where it is, but he's incredible.)

1933
01:11:54,413 --> 01:11:56,582
- It's not me. - Come on.

1934
01:11:56,849 --> 01:11:58,851
(Here it is.)

1935
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:01,520
(Goodness)

1936
01:12:01,554 --> 01:12:06,525
(She gives him a hard punch for cheating.)

1937
01:12:06,825 --> 01:12:10,062
This team probably got their feelings hurt.

1938
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:11,864
She hit you.

1939
01:12:11,964 --> 01:12:15,034
- That was awful. - I told you it wasn't me.

1940
01:12:15,067 --> 01:12:17,703
Do you give me new ballots?

1941
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:19,305
They might smell.

1942
01:12:19,305 --> 01:12:21,307
(That was a dirty hiding place.)

1943
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:23,742
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Si Young.

1944
01:12:23,943 --> 01:12:24,977
I'm sorry.

1945
01:12:24,977 --> 01:12:26,478
He improved.

1946
01:12:26,478 --> 01:12:28,814
He was serious too.

1947
01:12:28,948 --> 01:12:32,084
He acted so well.

1948
01:12:32,084 --> 01:12:34,353
He said it wasn't him because he doesn't do bad things...

1949
01:12:34,353 --> 01:12:35,754
when the camera is off.

1950
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:36,922
I stole it when the camera was on.

1951
01:12:36,922 --> 01:12:39,525
(He's an expert entertainer.)

1952
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:44,863
(When the mission was over in the restaurant...)

1953
01:12:45,464 --> 01:12:48,133
(Rustling)

1954
01:12:48,467 --> 01:12:52,404
(Kwang Soo's bad hand searches Si Young's pocket.)

1955
01:12:52,404 --> 01:12:55,574
(He stole the ballots!)

1956
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:59,044
(He acts like nothing happened.)

1957
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,681
I've never seen somebody like him.

1958
01:13:02,681 --> 01:13:03,849
(I've never seen somebody like him.)

1959
01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:06,118
(We've seen him for 8 years.)

1960
01:13:06,118 --> 01:13:07,453
Hey, you...

1961
01:13:07,453 --> 01:13:09,888
(She takes them back.)

1962
01:13:09,888 --> 01:13:12,591
- Are you fine now? - Yes.

1963
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:15,027
We're a team, so I have to accept him.

1964
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:16,895
We've been doing that for eight years.

1965
01:13:16,895 --> 01:13:17,930
(We're a team, so we accepted him for 8 years.)

1966
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:19,131
He's on his knees.

1967
01:13:19,131 --> 01:13:21,200
Stop acting like you feel guilty.

1968
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,002
You're going to do it again.

1969
01:13:23,002 --> 01:13:24,203
Stop acting.

1970
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:26,705
It looks like you find it unfair that you got caught.

1971
01:13:26,705 --> 01:13:30,275
That's what your face says. You are hoping you resisted.

1972
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:32,177
So did you succeed the mission?

1973
01:13:32,177 --> 01:13:33,545
- We did. - Yes.

1974
01:13:33,545 --> 01:13:34,613
- You did? - Really?

1975
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:36,982
Did you catch them?

1976
01:13:36,982 --> 01:13:38,350
- I didn't. - Right? You didn't.

1977
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:39,985
He was just feeding them.

1978
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:42,154
He can't catch them.

1979
01:13:42,154 --> 01:13:44,156
There was no car in front of your team...

1980
01:13:44,156 --> 01:13:45,624
(Rolling)

1981
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:48,227
(Goodness!)

1982
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,862
(A cup scares him.)

1983
01:13:49,862 --> 01:13:51,897
He's a coward, Byul.

1984
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:55,734
He's such a coward on Running Man.

1985
01:13:55,734 --> 01:13:57,603
I'm sorry. I didn't curse at you.

1986
01:13:57,603 --> 01:13:58,704
(I'm sorry for yelling.)

1987
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:00,372
I didn't curse at you.

1988
01:14:00,706 --> 01:14:01,940
Oh, my.

1989
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:04,610
I saw all sorts of things, so I got goosebumps.

1990
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:05,878
- Don't do this. - I'm sorry.

1991
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:08,180
It's strange you got scared by a cup.

1992
01:14:08,347 --> 01:14:10,716
- He's like that. - I got goosebumps. That's why.

1993
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,885
Do you find him cute when he does that?

1994
01:14:12,885 --> 01:14:14,420
What do you think?

1995
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,321
When we go to a theater,

1996
01:14:16,321 --> 01:14:17,690
he...

1997
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,324
- he's like... - I'll give you a ballot.

1998
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,759
(He tries to make her be quiet.)

1999
01:14:20,759 --> 01:14:23,529
If something pops out...

2000
01:14:23,529 --> 01:14:24,596
I'm not kidding.

2001
01:14:24,596 --> 01:14:25,898
His knees go up.

2002
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:27,099
(If a ghost pops out...)

2003
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:29,468
(He shouts and kicks.)

2004
01:14:29,468 --> 01:14:31,637
- He shouts. - Aren't you embarrassed of him?

2005
01:14:31,637 --> 01:14:33,572
- Every day. - "Every day".

2006
01:14:33,772 --> 01:14:35,641
We don't go.

2007
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:38,410
- We watch movies at home. - That's cute.

2008
01:14:38,577 --> 01:14:40,179
Thank you for your hard work today.

2009
01:14:40,179 --> 01:14:42,748
We'll give you a chance to earn additional ballots.

2010
01:14:42,748 --> 01:14:44,783
(They worked hard all day, so they get another chance.)

2011
01:14:45,384 --> 01:14:47,886
There are two additional ballots.

2012
01:14:47,886 --> 01:14:49,121
- 2. - 2?

2013
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:51,090
- This is a mission. - Two ballots?

2014
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:52,624
That's a lot.

2015
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,293
It's Toe Wrestling.

2016
01:14:54,293 --> 01:14:56,595
(The game is Toe Wrestling.)

2017
01:14:56,662 --> 01:14:58,797
It's 1-on-1 Toe Wrestling.

2018
01:14:58,797 --> 01:15:02,568
The team that survives until the end gets two additional ballots.

2019
01:15:02,568 --> 01:15:04,136
(She's competitive.)

2020
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:07,172
One person from each team should come forward.

2021
01:15:07,172 --> 01:15:09,374
I think Si Young is strong.

2022
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:11,276
Haha has big feet too.

2023
01:15:11,276 --> 01:15:13,812
First person from Team Si Young...

2024
01:15:13,912 --> 01:15:15,547
is Kwang Soo.

2025
01:15:15,547 --> 01:15:19,118
(Skills and length are proportional.)

2026
01:15:19,118 --> 01:15:21,553
Intimidation factor is important.

2027
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,455
From Team Ji Hyo...

2028
01:15:23,522 --> 01:15:24,690
(Who do you think it is?)

2029
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:27,226
(It's me!)

2030
01:15:27,426 --> 01:15:29,528
(Tallest versus Strongest)

2031
01:15:29,528 --> 01:15:32,231
(It's hard to predict.)

2032
01:15:32,531 --> 01:15:34,333
It'll feel somewhat different.

2033
01:15:34,366 --> 01:15:36,802
(My gosh)

2034
01:15:36,802 --> 01:15:38,670
- I'm serious. - Why?

2035
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,372
- Really? - They're purple.

2036
01:15:40,372 --> 01:15:41,807
(As soon as they lock their toes...)

2037
01:15:41,807 --> 01:15:43,575
Are your toes broken?

2038
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:45,544
Say it if you're in pain.

2039
01:15:45,544 --> 01:15:46,645
I'm in pain.

2040
01:15:46,645 --> 01:15:48,313
This is painful! How many times do I have to say it?

2041
01:15:48,313 --> 01:15:50,115
Don't be scared.

2042
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:51,116
Let's start.

2043
01:15:51,116 --> 01:15:53,051
I'm sorry. I don't think I can do this.

2044
01:15:53,418 --> 01:15:54,987
- I really can't do this. - Try it first.

2045
01:15:54,987 --> 01:15:56,989
- This is so painful. - Give it a try.

2046
01:15:56,989 --> 01:15:58,557
This is better.

2047
01:15:58,557 --> 01:16:01,393
How do you work out your toes?

2048
01:16:01,794 --> 01:16:02,895
Hold on.

2049
01:16:02,895 --> 01:16:04,429
(When did he work out his toes?)

2050
01:16:04,863 --> 01:16:07,733
You won. You're a champion.

2051
01:16:07,733 --> 01:16:09,768
He's sweating a lot.

2052
01:16:09,768 --> 01:16:11,870
Why are you sweating so much?

2053
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:14,106
I don't know.

2054
01:16:14,106 --> 01:16:15,607
Okay.

2055
01:16:15,607 --> 01:16:17,242
It's this foot.

2056
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:18,944
It's this foot.

2057
01:16:18,944 --> 01:16:20,379
(Se Chan, I'm right-footed.)

2058
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:22,714
Se Chan, it's this foot.

2059
01:16:22,815 --> 01:16:24,750
Okay, okay.

2060
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,652
Okay! This is good.

2061
01:16:27,686 --> 01:16:28,887
He's genuine.

2062
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:29,922
(He's my favorite.)

2063
01:16:29,922 --> 01:16:31,056
I'll hold you.

2064
01:16:31,056 --> 01:16:32,591
(We can't lose!)

2065
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:33,859
Let's be scary.

2066
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:35,427
How is that scary?

2067
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:36,829
How is this scary?

2068
01:16:36,829 --> 01:16:38,063
(His toe looked gentle.)

2069
01:16:38,063 --> 01:16:41,333
(It's angry now.)

2070
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:43,335
Did you get a pedicure?

2071
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:44,570
It's scary.

2072
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,104
(It's cute, so it doesn't achieve the purpose.)

2073
01:16:48,006 --> 01:16:49,775
(I feel like I lost already.)

2074
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,543
- Ready. - Okay, I'm ready.

2075
01:16:51,543 --> 01:16:53,445
This is one last time.

2076
01:16:53,445 --> 01:16:54,947
- Ready, - Good luck.

2077
01:16:54,947 --> 01:16:56,615
set...

2078
01:16:58,851 --> 01:17:00,953
Hold him.

2079
01:17:01,353 --> 01:17:03,355
(He tries desperately.)

2080
01:17:03,355 --> 01:17:04,823
(Look at him. He's pretty good.)

2081
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:06,625
- Use your body. - Let go.

2082
01:17:07,593 --> 01:17:09,761
(This is a close race.)

2083
01:17:09,761 --> 01:17:11,363
He's trying to win.

2084
01:17:11,363 --> 01:17:13,031
Look at Kwang Soo.

2085
01:17:13,031 --> 01:17:15,334
(I want to win!)

2086
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:22,574
(Do you want to win?)

2087
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:24,943
(Maybe next time.)

2088
01:17:27,212 --> 01:17:30,282
(Kwang Soo loses with a moan.)

2089
01:17:30,282 --> 01:17:32,284
All right! I did it.

2090
01:17:32,284 --> 01:17:33,852
(Don't try to beat me when it comes to using strength.)

2091
01:17:33,852 --> 01:17:35,254
He's so...

2092
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,788
He's so strong.

2093
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:39,224
Are you okay, Kwang Soo? Wipe your sweat.

2094
01:17:39,791 --> 01:17:41,693
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

2095
01:17:41,693 --> 01:17:43,028
I wiped my feet with this earlier.

2096
01:17:43,028 --> 01:17:46,665
(She realizes now.)

2097
01:17:47,065 --> 01:17:48,166
I'm sorry.

2098
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:49,334
(Why are you doing this to me, Byul?)

2099
01:17:49,334 --> 01:17:50,535
I am really sorry.

2100
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:52,304
I didn't mean to do that.

2101
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:55,040
(Gosh, Byul.)

2102
01:17:55,307 --> 01:17:57,309
(He is in tatters.)

2103
01:17:57,309 --> 01:17:59,678
Team Song Ji Hyo won...

2104
01:17:59,678 --> 01:18:01,914
- two ballots. - Okay.

2105
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:04,249
When do you go to work tomorrow?

2106
01:18:04,249 --> 01:18:05,250
In the morning.

2107
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:07,219
- We go to work at 3am. - Really?

2108
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:08,620
Let's play another round.

2109
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,055
(He doesn't give up.)

2110
01:18:10,055 --> 01:18:11,323
- What shall we bet? - Let's bet our ballots.

2111
01:18:11,323 --> 01:18:12,758
- What shall we bet? - I am for it.

2112
01:18:12,758 --> 01:18:14,192
Let's play a game that depends on luck.

2113
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:15,527
Sure.

2114
01:18:15,527 --> 01:18:17,029
The shoot is just getting started.

2115
01:18:17,029 --> 01:18:18,030
(Kwang Soo comes back to life.)

2116
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:19,665
A shoot for Running Man should make you sweat.

2117
01:18:19,665 --> 01:18:21,566
"A shoot for Running Man should make you sweat."

2118
01:18:21,566 --> 01:18:23,969
- Let's use this. - What?

2119
01:18:23,969 --> 01:18:25,170
- Write down your names. - Okay.

2120
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,539
- Let's bet 2 ballots each. - Okay.

2121
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:30,008
Who will spin it? Who spins the roulette is important.

2122
01:18:30,008 --> 01:18:31,743
- Shall we play rock-paper-scissors? - Let's do that.

2123
01:18:32,144 --> 01:18:34,179
Can we play muk-jji-ppa instead?

2124
01:18:34,179 --> 01:18:36,515
(She asks to change the game.)

2125
01:18:36,515 --> 01:18:38,083
- That team... - Let's keep it simple.

2126
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,584
- always wants to drag things out. - Come on.

2127
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:41,086
Let's keep it simple.

2128
01:18:41,086 --> 01:18:42,254
We have a plan.

2129
01:18:42,254 --> 01:18:43,789
- We have a plan. - Let's keep it simple.

2130
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:45,223
- We have a plan. - What shall I play?

2131
01:18:45,223 --> 01:18:46,458
- Muk-jji-ppa? - Rock.

2132
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,260
- Shall we play muk-jji-ppa? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

2133
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,295
You lose if you don't play. Rock-paper-scissors.

2134
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:51,964
(Team Si Young gets to spin the roulette.)

2135
01:18:51,964 --> 01:18:53,865
That was great.

2136
01:18:53,865 --> 01:18:55,400
They will spin the roulette.

2137
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,704
- Don't kick the roulette. - We know that.

2138
01:18:59,438 --> 01:19:00,672
You can do this. You did well so far.

2139
01:19:00,672 --> 01:19:01,707
Like sheep!

2140
01:19:01,707 --> 01:19:03,709
(She suddenly begins the chant.)

2141
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:05,911
- We, who spare nothing to give! - Are the best!

2142
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,212
Forget it!

2143
01:19:07,212 --> 01:19:08,914
(Like sheep, we, who spare nothing to give, are the best!)

2144
01:19:08,914 --> 01:19:12,084
(They have to think about their chant.)

2145
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:14,686
There is no teamwork whatsoever. Forget it.

2146
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:16,488
- We have a good teamwork. - Forget it.

2147
01:19:16,488 --> 01:19:17,889
You don't need to do it again.

2148
01:19:17,889 --> 01:19:18,924
Like sheep!

2149
01:19:18,924 --> 01:19:20,258
- We, who spare nothing to give! - We, who spare nothing to give!

2150
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:21,460
- Forget it. - Are the best!

2151
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,195
- What was that? - Stop it.

2152
01:19:23,328 --> 01:19:25,297
- For goodness' sake. - The best.

2153
01:19:25,297 --> 01:19:26,498
- They are ridiculous. - She spun it.

2154
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:28,133
- The best. - They are ridiculous.

2155
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:29,634
(The roulette of fate begins to spin.)

2156
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:34,806
(They will either win back the ballots they lost...)

2157
01:19:34,806 --> 01:19:38,343
(or lose 2 more ballots.)

2158
01:19:39,311 --> 01:19:40,412
(Team Ji Hyo wins.)

2159
01:19:40,412 --> 01:19:42,714
Song Ji Hyo! Song Ji Hyo!

2160
01:19:43,682 --> 01:19:45,183
(Team Ji Hyo wins 2 additional ballots.)

2161
01:19:45,183 --> 01:19:46,585
- Is it us? - Yes.

2162
01:19:46,585 --> 01:19:48,320
- Okay. - Yes.

2163
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,455
This is good.

2164
01:19:51,456 --> 01:19:54,793
(Their greed brought on a disaster.)

2165
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,862
All right. Go away.

2166
01:19:56,862 --> 01:19:57,863
(We shouldn't have done this.)

2167
01:19:57,863 --> 01:19:59,564
- Okay. - This is good.

2168
01:20:00,565 --> 01:20:02,300
We lacked the fighting spirit.

2169
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,336
You shouldn't have shouted the chant.

2170
01:20:04,336 --> 01:20:05,670
(Team Ji Hyo wins 4 ballots.)

2171
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,305
- Are we done? - Okay. The last round.

2172
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:08,340
Let's go.

2173
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,908
(Their instinct as tiger moths comes out.)

2174
01:20:09,908 --> 01:20:10,942
(Let's play the last round.)

2175
01:20:10,942 --> 01:20:12,911
- If people ask for more rounds, - Seriously.

2176
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:14,179
- I will give them a beating. - That would be wrong.

2177
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:16,314
In that case, let's bet three ballots.

2178
01:20:16,314 --> 01:20:17,783
- Bring it on. - Hold on.

2179
01:20:17,783 --> 01:20:19,518
- Byul, hold on. - No?

2180
01:20:19,518 --> 01:20:20,786
(Haha and Byul are tiger moth couple.)

2181
01:20:20,786 --> 01:20:22,988
- Byul likes challenges. - I mean...

2182
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:24,623
She is a tiger moth.

2183
01:20:24,623 --> 01:20:26,792
- Really? - She hasn't spun a roulette.

2184
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:27,826
You should spin a roulette.

2185
01:20:27,826 --> 01:20:29,194
Will you let us spin the roulette?

2186
01:20:29,194 --> 01:20:30,195
- Of course. - Okay.

2187
01:20:30,195 --> 01:20:31,363
- How many ballots? - We will spin the roulette.

2188
01:20:31,363 --> 01:20:32,464
Three ballots.

2189
01:20:32,464 --> 01:20:33,498
(It's a roulette with 3 ballots on the line.)

2190
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:36,234
- We won't play more games. - We will end after this.

2191
01:20:36,234 --> 01:20:38,637
However, you shouldn't leave if you are on our team.

2192
01:20:38,637 --> 01:20:39,905
We are sorry about that.

2193
01:20:39,905 --> 01:20:41,073
It's not over until it is.

2194
01:20:41,073 --> 01:20:42,441
We will be done in 15 minutes.

2195
01:20:42,441 --> 01:20:44,109
- Don't kick. - We won't do that.

2196
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:46,211
Don't do it. Here I go.

2197
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:51,817
(3 ballots are on the line.)

2198
01:20:51,817 --> 01:20:56,088
(This is the last game.)

2199
01:20:56,088 --> 01:20:58,924
(What will be the result?)

2200
01:20:58,924 --> 01:21:00,692
All right. Bring in the clapperboard.

2201
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:02,260
Come on.

2202
01:21:02,594 --> 01:21:05,530
(Let's end this as we promised.)

2203
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,865
Pick up the ballots.

2204
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:08,633
Did you pick them up?

2205
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:10,569
In 1, 2, 3.

2206
01:21:10,569 --> 01:21:11,870
Okay.

2207
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:14,106
(This is where the shoot ends today.)

2208
01:21:14,106 --> 01:21:15,173
(This is how scary game addiction can be.)

2209
01:21:15,173 --> 01:21:16,441
Today is our lucky day.

2210
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:18,076
We need to go to bed with these ballots.

2211
01:21:18,076 --> 01:21:20,312
We need to keep the doors locked.

2212
01:21:20,312 --> 01:21:22,280
- How many ballots do you have? - It's plausible.

2213
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,716
- Right? - It will be hard for us to lose.

2214
01:21:24,716 --> 01:21:26,118
Seriously.

2215
01:21:26,118 --> 01:21:29,087
Hold on. Si Young whispered to me...

2216
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:31,189
that Haha and Byul might be a scammer couple.

2217
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:33,658
(Are they a scammer couple?)

2218
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:35,794
For goodness' sake. Si Young.

2219
01:21:35,794 --> 01:21:37,395
- Tell us honestly. - Si Young.

2220
01:21:37,395 --> 01:21:39,731
- I am honest. - Si Young whispered that.

2221
01:21:39,731 --> 01:21:40,999
Seriously.

2222
01:21:40,999 --> 01:21:43,735
- Si Young has doubts. - I am not like that.

2223
01:21:43,735 --> 01:21:45,370
Byul.

2224
01:21:46,838 --> 01:21:51,543
(Everyone is asleep at 3am.)

2225
01:21:53,078 --> 01:21:58,950
(These people come out after barely wetting their faces.)

2226
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:03,855
(A vehicle that is headed to the sea awaits them.)

2227
01:22:03,855 --> 01:22:06,391
How many jobs do we have?

2228
01:22:06,725 --> 01:22:07,792
I don't know.

2229
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:09,895
We are fishermen now, right?

2230
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:13,665
(A few hours ago, Kwang Soo was an employee at a ranch.)

2231
01:22:13,798 --> 01:22:15,100
I don't even know.

2232
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,970
(Is this "Experiencing Life" or Running Man?)

2233
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:21,806
- Hello. - Hello.

2234
01:22:21,806 --> 01:22:23,542
(They get in the van to experience the life of a fisherman.)

2235
01:22:23,608 --> 01:22:27,712
(Si Young, who picked sandfish gets in the van as well.)

2236
01:22:28,313 --> 01:22:29,881
Did we sleep an hour?

2237
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:32,350
(They go to catch sandfish and complete a mystery mission.)

2238
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:34,819
This is my first time to forego a shower on a TV show.

2239
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,589
(It's her 1st time in 11 years to forego a shower.)

2240
01:22:37,589 --> 01:22:39,291
You didn't wash up?

2241
01:22:39,291 --> 01:22:41,660
I washed my face, but I didn't take a shower.

2242
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,096
- You styled your hair nicely. - You are diligent.

2243
01:22:45,096 --> 01:22:48,133
I just went to bed after washing my face.

2244
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,035
(Team Si Young arrives at their destination.)

2245
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:51,736
All right.

2246
01:22:51,736 --> 01:22:52,737
We are here.

2247
01:22:52,737 --> 01:22:54,172
Go, go!

2248
01:22:54,172 --> 01:22:55,373
We are here.

2249
01:22:55,373 --> 01:22:57,375
- All right. - We got here on time.

2250
01:22:57,442 --> 01:22:58,510
All right.

2251
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:01,980
(They can't stop laughing.)

2252
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:06,451
Your mission is to catch fish you haven't had at the restaurant.

2253
01:23:06,451 --> 01:23:07,852
- We chose sandfish. - That's right.

2254
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:09,487
You succeed this mission...

2255
01:23:09,487 --> 01:23:12,924
if you catch sandfish and complete an additional task.

2256
01:23:12,924 --> 01:23:15,594
There is an additional task.

2257
01:23:15,594 --> 01:23:18,563
We will reveal the additional task once you return to land.

2258
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:19,731
What could it be?

2259
01:23:19,731 --> 01:23:22,067
I advise you to remember everything...

2260
01:23:22,067 --> 01:23:24,669
that happens on the boat.

2261
01:23:24,936 --> 01:23:31,109
(Does it have to do with what happens during fishing?)

2262
01:23:31,109 --> 01:23:33,111
Gosh, let us rest.

2263
01:23:33,111 --> 01:23:34,412
(Do we need to remember everything?)

2264
01:23:34,412 --> 01:23:35,747
(Fishing is hard as it is.)

2265
01:23:35,747 --> 01:23:38,783
Let us focus on our work.

2266
01:23:38,783 --> 01:23:41,019
- Let us be at ease. - Stop making us anxious.

2267
01:23:41,019 --> 01:23:43,054
- Stop making us anxious. - Seriously.

2268
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:45,824
(They board the boat with an anxious heart.)

2269
01:23:46,024 --> 01:23:47,525
What could be the additional task?

2270
01:23:47,525 --> 01:23:49,794
(They set out to catch sandfish.)

2271
01:23:49,794 --> 01:23:52,931
(A self-proclaimed expert of reel fishing, Haha)

2272
01:23:52,931 --> 01:23:56,668
(A regular at Running Man's fishing-related missions, Kwang Soo)

2273
01:23:56,668 --> 01:24:00,405
(A former fisherwoman and a passionate leader, Si Young)

2274
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:02,774
(A group of fishing experts,)

2275
01:24:02,774 --> 01:24:06,378
(Team Si Young boards a sandfish boat.)

2276
01:24:06,378 --> 01:24:11,049
(Will they succeed? What could be the additional task?)

2277
01:24:11,049 --> 01:24:13,852
(Meanwhile, Team Hong Kong arrives at the accommodation.)

2278
01:24:13,852 --> 01:24:15,353
All right.

2279
01:24:15,353 --> 01:24:17,856
You failed your first mission.

2280
01:24:17,856 --> 01:24:20,025
- I am disappointed. - I am not disappointed at all.

2281
01:24:20,025 --> 01:24:21,359
- I am disappointed. - We couldn't eat more.

2282
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:23,628
- Seriously. - I am grateful that it's over.

2283
01:24:23,628 --> 01:24:25,330
I am grateful that it's over.

2284
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,400
Right now, Team Gangwon Province...

2285
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,168
completed all the missions...

2286
01:24:30,168 --> 01:24:33,338
and picked the missions for the second day.

2287
01:24:33,338 --> 01:24:35,240
Your last mission is...

2288
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,142
what you had in Russia.

2289
01:24:37,142 --> 01:24:38,610
(They had "Catch a king crab" when they were in Russia.)

2290
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,278
- What? - Catch a king crab.

2291
01:24:40,278 --> 01:24:41,313
Is that our mission?

2292
01:24:41,313 --> 01:24:42,781
- Is that our mission? - Don't worry.

2293
01:24:42,781 --> 01:24:46,751
You have the last chance.

2294
01:24:46,751 --> 01:24:48,453
What is it?

2295
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,555
(The last chance?)

2296
01:24:50,555 --> 01:24:53,358
Will you choose the mission you had in Russia...

2297
01:24:53,358 --> 01:24:55,493
or a new mission?

2298
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:56,795
- A new mission. - A new mission.

2299
01:24:56,795 --> 01:24:57,896
- How will we catch a king crab? - Seriously.

2300
01:24:57,896 --> 01:24:59,130
- We can't catch it. - It's impossible.

2301
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,532
In 1, 2, 3.

2302
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:01,833
- A new mission. - A new mission.

2303
01:25:01,833 --> 01:25:03,768
(Team Hong Kong chooses a new mission.)

2304
01:25:03,768 --> 01:25:05,937
We will reveal the new mission tomorrow morning.

2305
01:25:05,937 --> 01:25:07,672
- Okay. - Tomorrow morning?

2306
01:25:07,672 --> 01:25:08,973
(Why are they telling us tomorrow morning?)

2307
01:25:08,973 --> 01:25:10,408
- You won't tell us now? - Why not?

2308
01:25:10,408 --> 01:25:11,609
You will know...

2309
01:25:11,609 --> 01:25:12,877
- tomorrow morning. - Will we know naturally?

2310
01:25:12,877 --> 01:25:13,912
I am curious.

2311
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:17,148
If it's something about noodles or steak,

2312
01:25:17,148 --> 01:25:18,583
I won't stand still.

2313
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,719
Look forward to it. Have a good night.

2314
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,120
By the way,

2315
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,789
- I need a digestive medicine. - Please give us some.

2316
01:25:24,923 --> 01:25:26,858
- Okay. - Please deliver it to my room.

2317
01:25:26,858 --> 01:25:28,393
- All right. - Good night.

2318
01:25:28,393 --> 01:25:29,561
See you tomorrow.

2319
01:25:29,561 --> 01:25:31,863
(The first day ends as noodles bloat in their bellies.)

2320
01:25:32,197 --> 01:25:35,934
(The next day, early morning in Hong Kong)

2321
01:25:36,434 --> 01:25:37,535
All right.

2322
01:25:37,535 --> 01:25:38,536
(Production crew is in front of a room.)

2323
01:25:38,536 --> 01:25:40,338
- One. - Clap.

2324
01:25:40,338 --> 01:25:42,240
2, 3.

2325
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,109
(They get ready for the shoot.)

2326
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:46,010
(Unlocking)

2327
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:52,083
(They sneak into Jae Seok and Seok Jin's room.)

2328
01:25:52,917 --> 01:25:56,421
(They move in an orderly manner.)

2329
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:01,292
(Be quiet.)

2330
01:26:01,459 --> 01:26:03,995
Gosh, you startled me.

2331
01:26:05,230 --> 01:26:07,966
(They walk past Jae Seok...)

2332
01:26:07,966 --> 01:26:11,703
(and approach Seok Jin, who is still sleeping.)

2333
01:26:11,803 --> 01:26:14,172
(What are you doing?)

2334
01:26:14,172 --> 01:26:17,342
(What are you planning so early in the morning?)

2335
01:26:17,709 --> 01:26:18,843
(The crew doesn't care about Jae Seok.)

2336
01:26:18,843 --> 01:26:20,545
What are you doing?

2337
01:26:20,678 --> 01:26:23,715
(What is going on?)

2338
01:26:24,883 --> 01:26:28,653
(They spot Seok Jin, who is fast asleep.)

2339
01:26:28,653 --> 01:26:30,855
(Excuse me.)

2340
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,395
(Why did you wake him up?)

2341
01:26:37,629 --> 01:26:40,598
What comes to your mind when you think about Hong Kong?

2342
01:26:40,598 --> 01:26:43,334
5, 4, 3...

2343
01:26:43,334 --> 01:26:44,836
Chow Yun Fat.

2344
01:26:44,836 --> 01:26:46,471
(He is a Hong Kong actor.)

2345
01:26:46,771 --> 01:26:51,276
(Hong Kong reminds Seok Jin of Chow Yun Fat.)

2346
01:26:51,276 --> 01:26:52,844
(Chow Yun Fat)

2347
01:26:52,844 --> 01:26:54,145
- Can you repeat that? - Chow Yun Fat.

2348
01:26:54,145 --> 01:26:55,180
(Chow Yun Fat)

2349
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:57,282
See you later.

2350
01:26:59,117 --> 01:27:00,752
What was that?

2351
01:27:00,752 --> 01:27:02,253
See you later.

2352
01:27:02,253 --> 01:27:04,222
What? Is that all?

2353
01:27:04,556 --> 01:27:06,658
What was that about?

2354
01:27:06,658 --> 01:27:08,593
Why didn't you ask me a question?

2355
01:27:09,294 --> 01:27:11,029
I was awake.

2356
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:13,331
(A worrisome sneak attack ends.)

2357
01:27:14,599 --> 01:27:15,867
Did you sleep well?

2358
01:27:15,867 --> 01:27:17,135
Hello.

2359
01:27:17,135 --> 01:27:19,504
- I passed out. - I totally passed out.

2360
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:22,674
I must have eaten a lot of noodles. Look at my face.

2361
01:27:22,674 --> 01:27:24,209
(The size of his face doubled.)

2362
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:26,644
I could barely open my eyes when I woke up.

2363
01:27:26,644 --> 01:27:29,747
I wondered if someone stepped on Seok Jin's face during the night.

2364
01:27:29,747 --> 01:27:31,749
This isn't bad at all.

2365
01:27:31,749 --> 01:27:33,184
My face was more swollen in the morning.

2366
01:27:33,184 --> 01:27:34,752
I woke up three times during the night...

2367
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:35,887
- to go to the restroom. - The noodles...

2368
01:27:35,887 --> 01:27:38,056
- Really? - I produced some noodles.

2369
01:27:38,056 --> 01:27:40,024
(It's too much information.)

2370
01:27:40,024 --> 01:27:41,659
(She talks about producing noodles in the morning.)

2371
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:43,895
- For goodness' sake. - The things you say...

2372
01:27:43,895 --> 01:27:45,330
- I can't believe her. - For goodness' sake.

2373
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,799
She talks about these things when she is with us.

2374
01:27:47,799 --> 01:27:49,801
This is how she starts her morning.

2375
01:27:49,801 --> 01:27:50,869
(They are her reliable conversation buddies.)

2376
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:52,003
(Feeling satisfied)

2377
01:27:52,003 --> 01:27:55,507
You chose this mission over the mission in Russia yesterday.

2378
01:27:55,507 --> 01:27:57,242
I will reveal the new mission to you.

2379
01:27:57,242 --> 01:27:59,277
- What is it? - Yes, this is important.

2380
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:01,513
- I almost forgot about that. - What is it?

2381
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,748
(What is the 2nd mission of Team Hong Kong?)

2382
01:28:03,748 --> 01:28:04,749
"Take a photo..."

2383
01:28:04,749 --> 01:28:07,085
"Take a photo with Chow Yun Fat, the most famous figure..."

2384
01:28:07,085 --> 01:28:11,356
(Taking a photo with Chow Yun Fat? They can't believe their eyes.)

2385
01:28:11,356 --> 01:28:12,924
- Take a photo with him? - You want us to meet Chow Yun Fat?

2386
01:28:12,924 --> 01:28:15,693
(What are you talking about? Chow Yun Fat came out of nowhere!)

2387
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,529
- Where is... - Chow Yun Fat...

2388
01:28:17,529 --> 01:28:20,632
- Mr. Chow Yun Fat? - We don't know him personally.

2389
01:28:20,632 --> 01:28:22,400
(Here's an introduction of him.)

2390
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,637
(He's a boss in "A Better Tomorrow" who led the Hong Kong noir movies.)

2391
01:28:25,637 --> 01:28:28,973
(Chow Yun Fat, the man we loved back in the days)

2392
01:28:29,207 --> 01:28:32,243
(You want us to take a photo with this famous actor?)

2393
01:28:32,243 --> 01:28:34,812
- All right. A while ago, - This is...

2394
01:28:34,812 --> 01:28:38,116
we asked this question to Seok Jin, the oldest,

2395
01:28:38,116 --> 01:28:40,585
- for the whole group. - Right.

2396
01:28:41,019 --> 01:28:44,088
(It was 30 minutes ago before the shoot this morning.)

2397
01:28:44,088 --> 01:28:48,626
(The member in sleep was to answer this question.)

2398
01:28:48,626 --> 01:28:52,964
(That's how this mission became about meeting Chow Yun Fat.)

2399
01:28:53,031 --> 01:28:54,799
No way.

2400
01:28:54,799 --> 01:28:57,468
- You can't do that. - You woke me up from my sleep.

2401
01:28:57,468 --> 01:28:59,704
- He's already all over the place. - Come on.

2402
01:28:59,704 --> 01:29:03,374
- But he was probably half asleep. - Come on, Seok Jin.

2403
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:05,643
Why did you... Why did you say his name?

2404
01:29:05,643 --> 01:29:08,713
I was sleeping. He asked the figure of Hong Kong. It's him then.

2405
01:29:08,713 --> 01:29:10,815
- Chow Yun Fat. - Or you could've said...

2406
01:29:10,815 --> 01:29:12,283
Jae Seok's name or Running Man.

2407
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:13,651
- Exactly. You should've done that. - Had you done that...

2408
01:29:13,651 --> 01:29:15,720
- You could've completed right away. - If I said his name,

2409
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:18,022
- we would've be done now. - You would go home then.

2410
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:20,758
- How can we meet him? - How can we take a photo with him?

2411
01:29:20,758 --> 01:29:22,527
He's a famous guy.

2412
01:29:22,527 --> 01:29:24,729
(Everyone thought that it wasn't possible at that time.)

2413
01:29:24,729 --> 01:29:26,264
(He was here today?)

2414
01:29:26,264 --> 01:29:27,966
(We might be able to meet him.)

2415
01:29:28,066 --> 01:29:32,203
(Traces of Chow Yun Fat are found all over the place.)

2416
01:29:32,604 --> 01:29:36,574
(And something miraculous happened to Team Hong Kong.)

2417
01:29:36,908 --> 01:29:40,111
(What is the miracle they faced?)

2418
01:29:40,178 --> 01:29:41,179
Memories of Christmas!

2419
01:29:41,179 --> 01:29:43,181
(Merry Christmas)

2420
01:29:43,181 --> 01:29:46,751
(A guest visits Running Man like a present on Christmas.)

2421
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:48,653
(He's pretty nice.)

2422
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:53,024
(Miraculous stories no one imagined)

2423
01:29:53,024 --> 01:29:54,258
I guess it's a match too.

2424
01:29:54,258 --> 01:29:56,761
(However,)

2425
01:29:56,761 --> 01:30:00,131
(Running Man opened something that they aren't supposed to do.)

2426
01:30:00,131 --> 01:30:02,800
(What on earth happened on their Christmas?)

2427
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:05,670
(Christmas Special, The Miracle of Christmas)
