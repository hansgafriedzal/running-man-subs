1
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:08,529
(Last week)

2
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:11,208
(Seoul, Gangwon Province, and Hong Kong)

3
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,547
(Team So Min has been locked up in the Noodles of Underworld.)

4
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:16,123
(No matter how much they wanted to escape it,)

5
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:17,623
(people keep on recommending them noodles.)

6
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,193
(They failed the first mission to get a steak recommended and eat it.)

7
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:21,709
(Seoul, Gangwon Province)

8
00:00:21,863 --> 00:00:23,992
(Meanwhile, Team Ji Hyo's mission was to cook a meal for 100 people.)

9
00:00:23,993 --> 00:00:25,533
(They cooked furiously with the perfect teamwork.)

10
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,625
(They served the food furiously too.)

11
00:00:27,863 --> 00:00:30,272
(Team Ji Hyo completed their 1st mission by serving 100 people.)

12
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:32,372
(Meanwhile, Team Si Young's mission was to gather 4L of sheep milk.)

13
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:36,757
(They were in a crisis as the sheep didn't behave as they wanted.)

14
00:00:37,043 --> 00:00:41,427
(After endless attempts to win them over, they milked 4L.)

15
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:45,826
(After many complications, they completed the first mission.)

16
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:48,801
How many jobs have we done?

17
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:50,470
We'll be fishing now, right?

18
00:00:51,623 --> 00:00:53,192
(These people get on the car with a heavy heart.)

19
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:56,223
- My gosh. Hello. - Hi.

20
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:58,933
(Team Si Young must catch sailfin sandfish which they didn't eat...)

21
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:01,631
(and complete a mysterious mission.)

22
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,333
Will it take about an hour?

23
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:05,872
(They set out to the dock in Sokcho to fish.)

24
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:06,955
No, no.

25
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:09,402
Si Young, I was really born again today.

26
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,727
(Commenting out of the blue)

27
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:12,542
I'm serious. I really was.

28
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:13,982
(He suddenly makes a confession.)

29
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:15,498
I'm serious. I really was.

30
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:17,931
- I mean, I... - Earlier...

31
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,981
Team Leader Si Young, I really tried my best there.

32
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:25,252
(How does he have the ballots?)

33
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,678
Haha, I was...

34
00:01:26,864 --> 00:01:29,562
(A few hours ago, he had none. How does he have these ballots?)

35
00:01:29,563 --> 00:01:32,118
(Give them back, you brat.)

36
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,163
Where did you get these?

37
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:35,163
(She suddenly investigates him.)

38
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:37,356
(As a team leader, she seizes the ballot.)

39
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,645
My gosh, I got goosebumps.

40
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,824
- Where did you get them? - You're so scary.

41
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,473
- Tell me where you got it. - Hold on.

42
00:01:42,474 --> 00:01:44,172
(She furiously interrogates him.)

43
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:45,628
- Si Young. - Let go of me.

44
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,083
Don't do this. Don't.

45
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,800
- Where... Listen. - That's Se Chan's.

46
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:52,083
Why? Why? How did you get this?

47
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:53,436
It's Se Chan's.

48
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:54,622
But why do you have it?

49
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:55,723
Did you steal again?

50
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,107
(I thought you were born again.)

51
00:01:57,893 --> 00:01:59,105
Right now,

52
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:00,836
we finished filming.

53
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:03,487
Se Chan and I are rooming together.

54
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:05,912
Se Chan went inside to take a shower.

55
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:10,502
(The sound of Se Chan's showering fills the silent room.)

56
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:14,474
(Kwang Soo takes this chance and opens up Se Chan's bag.)

57
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,677
(He takes something out from Se Chan's bag.)

58
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:25,152
(Are those the ballots?)

59
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:27,583
(Forget about being reborn again. He stole all of his 4 ballots.)

60
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,533
(I'm sorry, Se Chan. I left you one. I'm being considerate.)

61
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:33,008
- Even until the end. - I wrote a letter.

62
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:34,174
Good job.

63
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:35,763
Well done.

64
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:38,162
It's the same as taking my money if you take the ballots.

65
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,678
I will hold onto these for now.

66
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:41,782
Hold on. Don't you think this is strange?

67
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:44,333
- I just wanted to join the game. - She's just holding onto them.

68
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,632
I will hold onto these.

69
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,895
I'm just keeping them for you. Understood? Okay?

70
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:51,395
What's going on? What is this?

71
00:02:51,614 --> 00:02:53,705
A long time ago, I saw this in a drama, "Boss".

72
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:56,306
When two guys pickpocketed people,

73
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,652
the boss took it away just like now.

74
00:02:57,653 --> 00:03:00,222
I will make this decision as a team leader.

75
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:03,053
- Is that okay with you? - I wanted to see your charisma.

76
00:03:03,054 --> 00:03:05,493
By the way, what you just did was so cool.

77
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:07,363
You forced my hands to steal someone else's.

78
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:08,879
Was I like this from the start?

79
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,382
I trusted everyone at first.

80
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,990
I didn't know that you would betray us,

81
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,963
but you betrayed us once before and stole Se Chan's ballots.

82
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:18,833
Nonetheless, this is helping our team,

83
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:20,442
so I will forgive you. Under one condition.

84
00:03:20,443 --> 00:03:22,323
I will hold onto these ballots.

85
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:25,513
- Let's not fight among ourselves. - Right.

86
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,043
Exactly. If we keep fighting, we'll ruin everything.

87
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:28,342
(Siding with the team leader)

88
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,495
Like sheep...

89
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,873
- We, who spare nothing to give, - We, who spare nothing to give,

90
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,083
- Are the best. - are the best.

91
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:34,295
All right. Let's go.

92
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:35,752
We've arrived.

93
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:36,966
- Si Young. - We arrived at a perfect timing.

94
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:39,173
When you snatched the ballots, you were really cool.

95
00:03:39,223 --> 00:03:40,779
We're here to catch sailfin sandfish.

96
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:45,467
(As they can't believe it, their feigned laughter bursts out.)

97
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,459
Let me sum up what your mission is today.

98
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:54,773
(Their mission was to catch the fish they didn't eat at the restaurant.)

99
00:03:54,774 --> 00:03:57,312
(Luckily, they chose the sailfin sandfish...)

100
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:59,543
(which are relatively easy to catch as they're in season now.)

101
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:00,826
In the midst of our trouble...

102
00:04:02,913 --> 00:04:06,590
If you catch the sailfin sandfish and complete the mysterious mission,

103
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,967
you will have completed the second mission.

104
00:04:08,323 --> 00:04:10,445
We have an extra mission.

105
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:13,691
We'll tell you what the mission is after you come back.

106
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:14,805
What could it be?

107
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:17,389
It will be advantageous to remember everything...

108
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:18,747
that takes place on the boat.

109
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:24,070
(Is the mission related to what happens while we fish?)

110
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:27,142
(They set out to try the mission while feeling worried.)

111
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:28,961
My gosh, what could the additional mission be?

112
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,413
I can catch fish with the fishing rod.

113
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:33,636
(They set out to catch sailfin sandfish!)

114
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:37,452
(They must catch the fish and complete a mysterious mission.)

115
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:40,786
(Will Team Si Young be able to successfully complete the mission?)

116
00:04:41,154 --> 00:04:42,382
Everyone, sit down.

117
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,505
(Acting like an expert)

118
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:46,917
(What's up with this guy?)

119
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,445
What are you doing?

120
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,307
He's a fisherman.

121
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,858
I'm sure you people from Seoul might not know a lot of things.

122
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,173
- Well, I've never seen... - Okay.

123
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,543
a fisherman put on the patch to prevent seasickness.

124
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,002
(A fisherman is wearing a patch that prevents seasickness?)

125
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,125
This is a mole.

126
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,072
(Fishermen have these moles.)

127
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,343
- That's a mole? - Yes.

128
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:07,393
(You, city people don't know it.)

129
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:10,136
(A suspicious fisherman with the patch-looking mole)

130
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,223
It prevents seasickness.

131
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:15,172
How long have you been working on the boat?

132
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,793
My family has been in this trade for four generations.

133
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:18,965
(He's in a family of fishermen that goes way back.)

134
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:22,797
(Although I get seasick, I am a fisherman.)

135
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:26,462
(Touching)

136
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:27,603
Hey, don't touch it.

137
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:28,762
(Giving him a warning sternly)

138
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:31,832
(My gosh, what's wrong with this guy?)

139
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,543
(Blowing his whistle)

140
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:34,872
(Where did he get the whistle?)

141
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,287
We're getting things ready.

142
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:40,043
You can just help us when we ask for your help.

143
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:41,933
- Have you done net fishing? - Just take a seat for now.

144
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:44,053
Four generations of my family have done it.

145
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:45,252
(I told you I'm in a family of fishermen.)

146
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:47,446
As for the sailfin sandfish you eat,

147
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:49,673
you should just think that they all come from our boat.

148
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:52,264
Okay.

149
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:54,163
(Waving his arm around)

150
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:56,587
(What is he doing now?)

151
00:05:56,963 --> 00:05:58,247
Do you... Do you know the boat?

152
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,956
- That's my aunt's. - Your aunt's?

153
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:03,447
I'm letting her pass first.

154
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:04,933
You let her go first?

155
00:06:04,934 --> 00:06:06,318
(He's the 4th generation of fisherman.)

156
00:06:07,174 --> 00:06:08,416
Stop.

157
00:06:08,844 --> 00:06:09,843
This is the spot.

158
00:06:09,844 --> 00:06:11,530
Did you give them the stopping signal?

159
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,683
I think the engine was turned off before...

160
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:15,058
- your signal. - No, no. That's not true.

161
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,406
- Is he always like that? - He's a weirdo.

162
00:06:19,883 --> 00:06:21,600
They're reeling it up right away.

163
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:25,426
- We spread out the nets before. - Right, right.

164
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,593
I hope we go back with a full load of fish.

165
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:29,775
(They are about to start.)

166
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:32,413
The current is strong today.

167
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,054
It's hard to catch fish today.

168
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:38,062
(It's hard to catch the fish due to the strong current.)

169
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:42,171
(It's hard to even balance themselves on the boat.)

170
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:45,701
(Frowning)

171
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:47,259
I think I'm getting nauseous.

172
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,582
(This 4th generation of fishermen shows signs of seasickness.)

173
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,340
- Sir, are you getting seasick? - No, no.

174
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:55,070
No, no. I have a headache.

175
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,309
I didn't know you had a headache.

176
00:06:59,224 --> 00:07:01,392
Open your eyes, and gaze afar.

177
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:02,979
(She finds him pathetic.)

178
00:07:03,763 --> 00:07:06,262
(Hey, fisherman. Gaze afar.)

179
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,859
(I thought you were the 4th generation of fishermen.)

180
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,103
My gosh, it's getting salty in my mouth.

181
00:07:11,104 --> 00:07:13,153
(When this fisherman is struggling with seasickness...)

182
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:14,556
I see the net now.

183
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,519
He's reeling up the net now.

184
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,072
We started now.

185
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:20,862
(The moment they catch sailfin sandfish, their mission is over.)

186
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:25,212
(Everyone pulls up the net with a hope of sailfin sandfish.)

187
00:07:25,213 --> 00:07:29,193
(However, they are only reeling up the empty net unlike their hope.)

188
00:07:32,094 --> 00:07:35,153
(I don't see any of the sailfin sandfish.)

189
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:37,652
- This is it for today, right? - Right.

190
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:40,002
It's because of the water. The waves are too rapid.

191
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:42,023
Are there times when you go back empty-handed?

192
00:07:42,063 --> 00:07:43,346
Of course.

193
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:44,986
On other days, we catch a lot.

194
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,395
They sometimes don't catch anything like today.

195
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:48,755
Really?

196
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:50,312
Why does it have to be today?

197
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:52,173
(The sailfin sandfish has vanished because of the strong waves.)

198
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:54,942
(If they don't catch any of them, they will fail their mission.)

199
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,012
(Team Si Young is exhausted as they only reel up the empty net.)

200
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,165
Captain, look.

201
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,812
- There's a fish. - Hey, there it is.

202
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,353
(At that moment,)

203
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:03,622
(something is caught in the net.)

204
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm beginning to see the fish.

205
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,493
(If the fish caught in the net is a sailfin sandfish,)

206
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,210
(it will mean they have completed the mission.)

207
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,702
(If it's not, they must wait not knowing for how long.)

208
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:16,673
(Will it be a sailfin sandfish just like everyone's wish?)

209
00:08:16,674 --> 00:08:19,360
Isn't this a sailfin sandfish?

210
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:22,862
- Isn't this a sailfin sandfish? - Yes, it is.

211
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:26,850
(According to the captain, it is a sailfin sandfish!)

212
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,857
We have a sailfin sandfish!

213
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,012
We got the sailfin sandfish as soon as we started.

214
00:08:31,013 --> 00:08:32,952
- We have the sailfin sandfish! - Get that.

215
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,498
Everyone, this is really happening!

216
00:08:35,284 --> 00:08:37,423
- Sir... There are more coming. - That's it.

217
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:38,565
We are just getting started.

218
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,637
This is the second sailfin sandfish.

219
00:08:41,093 --> 00:08:42,709
Gosh, there's a flood of them now.

220
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:44,275
There are so many of them.

221
00:08:44,363 --> 00:08:45,747
Gosh, they are all over the net.

222
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:48,163
I'm so relieved that there are a lot.

223
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,702
(A pile of sailfin sandfish)

224
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:50,916
It's all sailfin sandfish.

225
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,102
(They complete the mission of catching the sailfin sandfish.)

226
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:56,072
If we chose another fish, we wouldn't have accomplished it.

227
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:57,155
(However,)

228
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,773
(the staff said they must complete one extra mission.)

229
00:08:58,774 --> 00:09:00,183
(It's not over yet.)

230
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:05,637
Everyone, let us explain about the sailfin sandfish.

231
00:09:05,684 --> 00:09:07,037
Okay.

232
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:10,453
The sailfin sandfish resemble a lot of other fish.

233
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:12,715
Listen up. This must be the mission. It's the second mission.

234
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,104
Pay attention.

235
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,862
(Let us explain about the sailfin sandfish.)

236
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:18,992
(The sailfin sandfish resemble a lot of other fish.)

237
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,362
(They look similar to sweetfish and sand lance.)

238
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:23,503
(During the Japanese Invasion, the king was evacuating...)

239
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,633
(and had a fish named sandfish. After he came back,)

240
00:09:25,634 --> 00:09:28,572
(he had a sweetfish, but he called it a sandfish.)

241
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:32,653
(There's a sailfin sandfish festival in Cheongho-dong every November.)

242
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,413
(Anyway...)

243
00:09:35,414 --> 00:09:37,212
So this is the mission, right?

244
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,553
(The net doesn't seem to end.)

245
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:40,653
This isn't a penalty, right? It is a mission, right?

246
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:41,937
(There are so many fish.)

247
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:44,492
But we won't have a chance to do this ever again.

248
00:09:44,493 --> 00:09:45,893
- Seriously. - Right.

249
00:09:45,894 --> 00:09:48,085
- It's rewarding though. - Yes, it sure is rewarding.

250
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:52,232
(One side of the boat is filled up with the sailfin sandfish.)

251
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,903
We're done!

252
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:55,580
- The boat is full! - My gosh!

253
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:57,516
- The boat is full. - Gosh.

254
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:01,773
(They return to the land with a full load of sailfin sandfish.)

255
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:02,903
Well done.

256
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,590
- Good work. - Good work.

257
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:08,817
If you complete the mission we explained earlier,

258
00:10:08,914 --> 00:10:11,741
- you will have finished all of it. - Okay.

259
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:13,967
Bring in the food now.

260
00:10:16,453 --> 00:10:18,171
- We'll really eat this? - What's this?

261
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:21,592
(The additional mission is finally presented.)

262
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:23,692
The sailfin sandfish you caught earlier...

263
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:26,158
are on one of the plates.

264
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:28,003
- Isn't this too easy? - These are the sailfin sandfish.

265
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,346
- These are sailfin sandfish. - Right.

266
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:32,959
- It's the ones on a blue plate. - We know that.

267
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:37,184
What's the name of these fish that look just like sailfin sandfish?

268
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,173
They are sand lance.

269
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:41,164
- It was that or sweetfish, - Sweetfish.

270
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:44,841
But you said that sweetfish and sailfin sandfish are different.

271
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:45,982
Those are not sweetfish.

272
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:47,166
You said they were different.

273
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:48,597
(The captain gets involved all of a sudden.)

274
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:51,448
Those are sand eels.

275
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:53,068
- These are sand eels? - We have the answer.

276
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:54,606
Sand eels and sand lances are the same things.

277
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,543
(He kindly confirms it.)

278
00:10:57,264 --> 00:11:00,232
(Nice assist)

279
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:02,163
(The captain even tells them the answer.)

280
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:04,472
- It's sandlance. - It's sandlance.

281
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:05,572
- Right? - Sandlance.

282
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:06,903
He said, "sandlance", and left.

283
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,173
I told you.

284
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,342
1, 2, 3.

285
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:10,413
- Sandlance. - Sandlance.

286
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:11,673
(The answer is "sandlance".)

287
00:11:11,674 --> 00:11:13,842
(Did the captain tell them the correct answer?)

288
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:15,982
(Or will there be a twist?)

289
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,124
It's correct.

290
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,753
(The name of the fish is "sandlance".)

291
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,123
(They got the question right.)

292
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:23,437
It ended beautifully.

293
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:25,574
If we had said the wrong answer, we would have failed.

294
00:11:26,654 --> 00:11:28,423
We would have failed.

295
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:30,862
- We did a great job. - Right?

296
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,984
(While Team Si Young is celebrating their victory,)

297
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,232
(Team Hong Kong wakes up, worried about their mission.)

298
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:38,403
- Let me announce a new mission. - What is it?

299
00:11:38,404 --> 00:11:40,726
We have to meet Chow Yun Fat?

300
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:44,072
(Earlier this morning, the staff barged into Seok Jin's room.)

301
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,883
(Half-asleep, Seok Jin answered, "Chow Yun Fat".)

302
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:49,509
(Now their second mission is "Taking a picture with Chow Yun Fat".)

303
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,013
How can we meet Chow Yun Fat?

304
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:53,523
How can we take a picture with him?

305
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,423
- He's a huge star. - Exactly.

306
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,923
But you're lucky.

307
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,293
(It's not impossible.)

308
00:11:59,294 --> 00:12:02,592
Chow Yun Fat is seen at various places in Hong Kong.

309
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:05,933
- He uses public transportation. - No way.

310
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,163
I've read the articles.

311
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:08,503
I've seen it on the internet.

312
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:10,019
Still, it'd be hard to find him.

313
00:12:10,274 --> 00:12:12,903
Many Korean tourists have taken pictures with him...

314
00:12:12,904 --> 00:12:15,442
at restaurants and cafes or on the street.

315
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,442
Really?

316
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,712
It's all over social media.

317
00:12:17,713 --> 00:12:19,212
- Guys. - I don't want to say this, but...

318
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:23,122
There is a noodle place frequented by Chow Yun Fat.

319
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:25,352
(A noodle place frequented by Chow Yun Fat?)

320
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:26,363
Let's go there.

321
00:12:27,384 --> 00:12:28,939
(Excited)

322
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:31,092
- But... - This is not okay.

323
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:33,123
- It's noodles again. - This is not okay.

324
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:34,393
I didn't realize, but it's noodles.

325
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,462
Are we having noodles again, from early morning?

326
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,763
But Chow Yun Fat often goes there. "Chow Yun Fat is here again."

327
00:12:38,764 --> 00:12:39,933
(Chow Yun Fat is said to frequent the restaurant.)

328
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,362
That's the title of the article.

329
00:12:41,363 --> 00:12:44,403
There is a restaurant in Kowloon City.

330
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,602
Chow Yun Fat often eats porridge here.

331
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,442
"He was wearing a black sweatsuit and dark sunglasses."

332
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,712
- Really? - Chow Yun Fat.

333
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,472
- We might be done soon. - That's right.

334
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,898
- Let's go. - Let's go.

335
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:56,342
Will we be able to find him?

336
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,952
It'd be amazing if we meet him.

337
00:12:57,953 --> 00:12:59,226
Definitely.

338
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:01,822
- If we meet him... - We'd be so lucky.

339
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,541
(Will they be able to meet the legendary Chow Yun Fat?)

340
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,623
(Chow Yun Fat, 63 years old)

341
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:11,393
(He is a legendary Hong Kong actor famous for his film noirs.)

342
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:12,677
(He is often seen at a porridge place in Kowloon City.)

343
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:14,803
(Hotel)

344
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:16,163
(They move to the restaurant frequented by Chow Yun Fat.)

345
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:19,102
(Porridge restaurant)

346
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,860
Chow Yun Fat...

347
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,590
By the way, shouldn't we do that?

348
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,285
- Ballots... - Ballots...

349
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:26,513
We should do it.

350
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,856
We should divide them up.

351
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:30,852
I have 2, and So Min has 1.

352
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,383
Seok Jin has none.

353
00:13:32,384 --> 00:13:34,183
As long as we don't target each other, it'll be fine.

354
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:36,623
How many should the winner get, 2 or 1?

355
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,123
- 2. - 2.

356
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,134
What game should we play?

357
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,474
A word game?

358
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:41,893
- Okay. - Kungkungta.

359
00:13:41,894 --> 00:13:42,923
Let's do it.

360
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,263
(They play a word game to win 2 ballots.)

361
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:45,533
Can we say a word that's already been said?

362
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,745
Yes.

363
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,433
Let's start with "Chow Yun Fat".

364
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:50,202
- Chow Yun Fat? - Start.

365
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,933
(Kung, kung, kung)

366
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:57,013
(It's been a long time since they play a game to the rhythm.)

367
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:58,413
Chow Yun Fat, kungkungta.

368
00:13:58,414 --> 00:13:59,612
(Chow Yun Fat)

369
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:00,742
"Foot odor", kungkungta.

370
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:01,913
"Bird Song", kungkungta.

371
00:14:01,914 --> 00:14:03,125
"Old man", kungkungta.

372
00:14:03,284 --> 00:14:04,683
"King", kungkungta.

373
00:14:04,684 --> 00:14:05,913
"King", kungkungta.

374
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,082
"King", kungkungta.

375
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,222
"King", kungkungta.

376
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,436
"King", kungkungta.

377
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,322
(Are they singing a round?)

378
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:12,452
(King)

379
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:14,192
(King)

380
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,462
"Lim Ha Ryong", kungkungta.

381
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,862
(It suddenly changes.)

382
00:14:16,863 --> 00:14:18,433
(Lim Ha Ryong?)

383
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:21,130
"Dr. Ryong", kungkungta.

384
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,273
- What's "Dr. Ryong"? - What's "Dr. Ryong"?

385
00:14:24,274 --> 00:14:26,602
- What's that? - I know what it is.

386
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,865
There's a crab restaurant called "Dr. Ryong".

387
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,690
What's "Dr. Ryong"?

388
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:31,854
You're out.

389
00:14:31,943 --> 00:14:34,013
- It's you and me. - It's hard.

390
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:35,712
- You and me. - Let's start with "Jeon So Min".

391
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,053
- Start. - Kung, kung, kung

392
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:39,812
(Which of them will win 2 ballots?)

393
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:42,722
(Another round)

394
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:43,906
"Song Ji Hyo", kungkungta.

395
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,822
(I thought it was "Jeon So Min".)

396
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:47,923
"Fedor", kungkungta.

397
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:48,923
(Fedor)

398
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:50,433
(You succeeded?)

399
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:52,615
"L Brand", kungkungta.

400
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,582
(It's almost the only word you can say.)

401
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:57,673
What's wrong?

402
00:14:57,674 --> 00:14:58,713
There is L Brand.

403
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,094
- L Brand. - It's over.

404
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:03,373
- It's over. I have 4 now. - Jae Seok has 4.

405
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:04,673
(Jae Seok wins 2 more ballots.)

406
00:15:04,674 --> 00:15:05,712
He always attacks his own team member.

407
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:08,183
He suddenly said, "Song Ji Hyo". That's so sly.

408
00:15:08,184 --> 00:15:10,001
- And he said, "Fedor". - Fedor.

409
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:13,722
I shouldn't have suggested a word game.

410
00:15:13,723 --> 00:15:15,023
- It's hard. - I'm happy.

411
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,082
Okay.

412
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,253
It's over now.

413
00:15:17,254 --> 00:15:18,293
(Jae Seok has way more ballots than the others.)

414
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,393
Seok Jin is so funny.

415
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:20,878
(Who will get the remaining 5?)

416
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:23,692
I used to listen to this a lot.

417
00:15:23,693 --> 00:15:25,793
(Soundtrack of "A Better Tomorrow")

418
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,862
(Where are you, Chow Yun Fat?)

419
00:15:27,863 --> 00:15:29,133
We're on our way to Chow Yun Fat.

420
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:30,533
(They'd love to meet their childhood idol.)

421
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,190
I really hope we can meet him.

422
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:35,102
(Singing)

423
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:38,342
(Singing)

424
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:41,009
(Their voices sound so feminine.)

425
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,037
(Is that how this song is supposed to be sung?)

426
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:47,123
(Singing)

427
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:49,103
(Immersed)

428
00:15:50,223 --> 00:15:53,822
(The song brings back memories.)

429
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:55,592
If we really meet Chow Yun Fat...

430
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:58,192
(If we really meet Chow Yun Fat...)

431
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,903
(They wouldn't be able to communicate.)

432
00:16:00,904 --> 00:16:03,085
(They're immersed in memories.)

433
00:16:03,874 --> 00:16:06,499
Shouldn't we buy trench coats for them?

434
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,643
- I really want to meet him. - Chow Yun Fat...

435
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:10,986
It'd be amazing.

436
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,760
It'd make my heart beat.

437
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,913
Your heart should always beat.

438
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,413
(Jae Seok ruins the mood.)

439
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,565
Hey.

440
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:19,199
Your heart...

441
00:16:19,983 --> 00:16:21,852
Isn't your heart beating?

442
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:23,653
- That's not what I mean. - But...

443
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:26,852
- It's a poetic experssion. - You should say, "burst".

444
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,338
Not "beat".

445
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,793
- If it doesn't beat, you die. - You die.

446
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:33,188
(Anyway, they're excited.)

447
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:34,503
I think we're here.

448
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:35,948
(They arrive at the restaurant.)

449
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:38,294
Are we going to order the Chow Yun Fat combo?

450
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,403
The Chow Yun Fat combo.

451
00:16:39,404 --> 00:16:42,303
- The combo menu Chow Yun Fat eats. - We should give him a nickname.

452
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:44,373
- We should give him a nickname. - We should give him a nickname.

453
00:16:44,374 --> 00:16:46,173
- Chow Yunbari. - Jeon Sobari, Yu Jaebari,

454
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,383
- Jee Seokbari, - Jee Seokbari,

455
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,868
- Chow Yunbari. - Chow Yunbari.

456
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,452
- We're the Baribari family. - We're the Baribari family.

457
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,783
We should tell him if we meet him.

458
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:57,046
- Chow Yunbari. - I already feel so close to him.

459
00:16:57,254 --> 00:16:58,393
Chow Yunbari.

460
00:16:58,394 --> 00:16:59,404
(They want to let him know they're all family now.)

461
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:02,492
The place looks a bit shabby.

462
00:17:03,394 --> 00:17:04,593
It's this place?

463
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:06,433
(It's a shabby-looking restaurant.)

464
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,103
(But it's many decades old.)

465
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:09,579
There are so many customers.

466
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:12,573
It's early morning, and it's full.

467
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,673
(The restaurant is filled with local people from early morning.)

468
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:15,942
There's a dog.

469
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:18,873
(Chow Yun Fat is said to eat here often.)

470
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,425
(Chow Yun Fat...)

471
00:17:20,713 --> 00:17:21,712
(Is he here?)

472
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,212
Chow Yun Fat... When...

473
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,566
(Welcome)

474
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,070
She wants us to come in.

475
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:28,597
We were just asking a question.

476
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,943
Please ask them when Chow Yun Fat was here last.

477
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:36,184
When was he here?

478
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:40,875
(Chow Yun Fat and the owner are good friends.)

479
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,408
(He was here...)

480
00:17:44,874 --> 00:17:46,133
At seven.

481
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,373
At seven this morning?

482
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:49,060
- This morning? - This morning?

483
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:50,843
Every day.

484
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,792
(He comes here every day.)

485
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:54,843
(Every day?)

486
00:17:54,844 --> 00:17:56,935
- Every day? - At seven?

487
00:17:57,184 --> 00:17:58,282
Yes.

488
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,282
He was already here.

489
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,395
He was just here.

490
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:04,052
(At 7am, while they were sleeping at the hotel,)

491
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:07,862
(Chow Yun Fat enjoyed his breakfast here.)

492
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:09,762
One day...

493
00:18:09,763 --> 00:18:11,612
(I've taken a picture with Chow Yun Fat.)

494
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,393
Ask him if Chow Yun Fat likes taking pictures.

495
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:16,332
He often comes here in the morning, has breakfast,

496
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:19,532
and takes pictures with the other customers.

497
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,089
- He talks with them too. - He talks?

498
00:18:21,303 --> 00:18:22,742
- We should have been there. - That's incredible.

499
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:24,128
Let's stay here one more day.

500
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:25,942
If we had been here at seven...

501
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:27,442
- We could have... - We might be able to meet him.

502
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:28,929
- Exactly. - Today...

503
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:32,252
What did he eat today?

504
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,083
(What did Chow Yun Fat eat this morning?)

505
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:35,153
(Fish porridge)

506
00:18:35,154 --> 00:18:37,314
He ate the porridge he usually eats...

507
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:39,722
and stir-fried noodles.

508
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,292
(Stir-fried noodles)

509
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:42,593
- Okay. - Okay.

510
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:44,032
(Noodles?)

511
00:18:44,033 --> 00:18:45,650
Oh I see. But because of our personal reasons,

512
00:18:45,894 --> 00:18:47,563
we'll just order the porridge.

513
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,433
Please tell them we don't want the noodles.

514
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:50,888
(They'll try just the porridge.)

515
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,272
That was so close.

516
00:18:53,273 --> 00:18:54,302
I know.

517
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:56,202
We could have completed the mission and headed home.

518
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,789
This is what Chow Yun Fat eats?

519
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,472
It's fish porridge, right?

520
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,343
(Generous)

521
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,212
Chow Yun Fat...

522
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,375
- We ordered the Chow Yun Fat combo. - The Chow Yun Fat combo.

523
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,782
The Yunbari combo.

524
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:09,623
It has some meat in it.

525
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,022
It must be fish.

526
00:19:11,023 --> 00:19:13,052
- It's fish? - It's fish porridge.

527
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:16,192
Is this what they eat in "A Better Tomorrow"?

528
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:17,233
That's right.

529
00:19:17,763 --> 00:19:19,380
- It tastes good. - Let me try.

530
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,933
It's a little salty and very flavorful.

531
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:24,333
It's really flavorful.

532
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:25,532
This is nice.

533
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,873
It tastes really good.

534
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,673
- It tastes so rich. - It's slightly salty.

535
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:29,702
It tastes so good.

536
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:30,913
It's flavorful.

537
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:33,266
I can see why Chow Yun Fat eats this every morning.

538
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,583
It'd be perfect for breakfast. It's easy on the stomach.

539
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:36,594
Exactly.

540
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:39,353
(In the middle of eating,)

541
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,452
(he makes a V sign.)

542
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:43,482
(Cute)

543
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:45,593
Because Chow Yun Fat takes pictures with the other customers...

544
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:47,093
- Move your head. - Gosh.

545
00:19:47,094 --> 00:19:48,609
It's because Chow Yun Fat takes pictures with them.

546
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:50,536
(I want to be in the picture too.)

547
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,850
(All together)

548
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:54,477
(Click)

549
00:19:54,934 --> 00:19:57,232
Chow Yun Fat takes pictures with the other customers.

550
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,873
We should do it too.

551
00:19:58,874 --> 00:20:00,045
(The fan is happy.)

552
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,899
(The waitress casually puts something on their table.)

553
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,982
(Noodles?)

554
00:20:07,983 --> 00:20:09,832
(Heaping)

555
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,482
We're really fine but...

556
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,201
(We said we didn't want noodles.)

557
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:15,522
Well...

558
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:16,923
(They have to eat noodles again.)

559
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,812
(It's on the house.)

560
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,823
(More noodles)

561
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:24,086
It's what Chow Yun Fat eats.

562
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:26,563
It's included in the combo menu.

563
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:28,202
It's the Chow Yun Fat combo.

564
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:29,202
The Chow Yun Fat combo.

565
00:20:29,203 --> 00:20:30,618
Jee Seokbari.

566
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:33,527
- Jeon Sobari. Yu Jaebari. - Jeon Sobari. Yu Jaebari.

567
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,156
We're eating the Chow Yunbari combo.

568
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,385
Chow Yunbari.

569
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:39,942
(Enjoying)

570
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,126
It tastes so good.

571
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:44,439
(He can't stop.)

572
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:47,366
Why aren't you eating the noodles?

573
00:20:48,723 --> 00:20:51,551
No one seems to...

574
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:54,323
Why is no one eating the noodles?

575
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:55,677
Sobari, sobari, but you

576
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,054
Since Chow Yun Fat eats them, I'll try some.

577
00:20:59,434 --> 00:21:00,776
(Taking a big bite)

578
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:04,232
(How do the noodles taste?)

579
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,032
I can't eat any more noodles.

580
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,670
My mouth refuses to take more noodles.

581
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:11,113
You know what?

582
00:21:11,114 --> 00:21:12,772
If Chow Yun Fat ate breakfast here,

583
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,482
- that means he's not working today. - He's not working.

584
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,282
- Is that so? - That's when he eats breakfast.

585
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:18,083
He must be around here somewhere.

586
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,252
I heard he walks around the city.

587
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,613
Shall I ask the restaurant owner?

588
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,353
- Where he goes? - Where does he go next?

589
00:21:22,354 --> 00:21:25,022
- Go ahead. - Where does Chow Yun Fat go...

590
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:26,893
when he leaves here? Does he have lunch?

591
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:28,439
- There's a milk tea shop. - Right now,

592
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:31,696
the restaurant owner told...

593
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:34,530
Chow Yun Fat's friend that we're here.

594
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:37,133
He asked where Chow Yun Fat is, so wait a little.

595
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,732
- That's amazing. - Really?

596
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,272
Does he know his friend?

597
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,502
He knows Chow Yun Fat's friend?

598
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,260
You might meet him today.

599
00:21:43,904 --> 00:21:45,772
- If we meet him... - My dream would come true.

600
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,512
- I know what you mean. - Seok Jin.

601
00:21:47,513 --> 00:21:50,712
Here's what I found while reading articles.

602
00:21:50,713 --> 00:21:53,512
It's an article about what Chow Yun Fat said.

603
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,623
- However, - What did he say?

604
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:57,007
- he's very different from Seok Jin. - Why?

605
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:59,042
In one article,

606
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:02,762
he said, "You don't wear clothes to show to other people."

607
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,158
(Chow Yun Fat's famous saying)

608
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,292
It's enough if they're comfortable.

609
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:09,502
It's different from what Seok Jin thinks.

610
00:22:09,503 --> 00:22:10,502
He doesn't think that.

611
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,133
I prefer to look fancy to being comfortable.

612
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,002
He likes white pants.

613
00:22:14,003 --> 00:22:17,042
Being shown to people is important such as white pants.

614
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,143
He said, "Money isn't mine."

615
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,813
"I'm only keeping it for a while."

616
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,542
Seok Jin would say that it's definitely his money.

617
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:23,542
(Money is mine indeed.)

618
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:26,653
Seok Jin wants to become successful all of a sudden.

619
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:29,423
Chow Yun Fat said, "My dream is becoming a happy, normal person."

620
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:30,522
("My dream is becoming a normal person.")

621
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,923
- He's different. - He's completely different...

622
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:34,681
from Seok Jin.

623
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,363
Chow Yun Fat is impressive.

624
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:37,933
- Isn't he amazing? - He really is.

625
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,246
He has famous sayings.

626
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,563
Let's go to the milk tea shop.

627
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:43,663
- He'll call us. - Okay, milk tea.

628
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,032
I've been craving milk tea since yesterday.

629
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:47,770
Seok Jin said that Chow Yun Fat drinks milk tea.

630
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:49,942
- We're lucky today. - I was craving it.

631
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:51,673
Our second day is better than the first.

632
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:53,143
- It's great. - I'm happy.

633
00:22:53,144 --> 00:22:55,083
My goodness.

634
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:57,083
(They head to the second place where he frequents.)

635
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,083
(Milk tea shop)

636
00:22:58,084 --> 00:22:59,613
I want to meet him...

637
00:22:59,614 --> 00:23:01,183
- all of a sudden. - I really want to meet him.

638
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:05,163
I want to meet him more now that it may be possible.

639
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,492
It'd be interesting to meet him.

640
00:23:07,493 --> 00:23:09,745
I might even scream.

641
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:11,732
Won't that be embarrassing?

642
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,032
It won't be embarrassing, but Chow Yun Fat would hate it.

643
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:16,262
- Why would he hate it? - He would hate if you scream.

644
00:23:16,263 --> 00:23:18,355
I like when people scream at me.

645
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,573
It's because it doesn't happen often.

646
00:23:20,574 --> 00:23:22,573
(He attacks with a fact.)

647
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:25,413
Hey, it happens often.

648
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:26,542
Who would scream?

649
00:23:26,543 --> 00:23:28,735
Do you know how much I get screamed at home?

650
00:23:29,644 --> 00:23:31,813
- "Why did you put it here?" - Do you mean your wife?

651
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:35,083
"I told you to put it in your closet."

652
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:37,183
(He'd do anything if he meets Chow Yun Fat.)

653
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:39,446
"Why did you put it here?"

654
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:41,005
Someone is calling.

655
00:23:41,763 --> 00:23:43,612
- Why is Jong Kook calling? - It's Jong Kook.

656
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:46,555
(They get a sudden call from Jong Kook.)

657
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:48,502
Hello, Jin, Jin, Jin.

658
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:49,543
(What's going on?)

659
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,833
(After serving food to 100 people,)

660
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,302
(here's the second mission for Team Ji Hyo.)

661
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:55,442
Okay.

662
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:58,143
(Last time was getting a hairstyle that's popular in Osaka.)

663
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:03,669
(Find a hair salon that includes a celebrity's name.)

664
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,353
(Before going to the hair salon,)

665
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:12,889
(they must win a speed quiz on the phone with the celebrity.)

666
00:24:13,594 --> 00:24:15,292
"Hair salons in Sokcho".

667
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:16,722
(He searches hair salons in Sokcho.)

668
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,563
There's Jin Hair Salon.

669
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:21,532
- Who's Jin? - There's Lee Jin of Fin.K.L.

670
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,633
- There's also Junjin. - You're right.

671
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:26,472
Doesn't it include Seok Jin? We sometimes call him Jin.

672
00:24:26,473 --> 00:24:28,059
(Can it also be Seok Jin?)

673
00:24:28,303 --> 00:24:31,607
We sometimes call him Jin, Jin, Jin.

674
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:33,113
Call him Jin, Jin, Jin.

675
00:24:33,114 --> 00:24:35,313
If Seok Jin responds, we'll accept it.

676
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:38,113
I'll call him Jin, Jin, Jin. Listen.

677
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:39,353
Seriously?

678
00:24:39,354 --> 00:24:40,613
- I'm curious. - I'll try.

679
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,402
(If the quiz is a success, they head to Jin Hair Salon.)

680
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:46,893
(How does Jin, Jin, Jin react?)

681
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,823
Hello, Jong Kook.

682
00:24:48,824 --> 00:24:50,022
(He doesn't hesitate at all.)

683
00:24:50,023 --> 00:24:51,393
Hello, Jong Kook.

684
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:53,333
(He accepts being Jin, Jin, Jin.)

685
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:56,232
- It worked. - Okay, we got it.

686
00:24:56,303 --> 00:24:58,673
You know a Korean movie with zombies?

687
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:00,472
- It takes place on a train. - What?

688
00:25:00,473 --> 00:25:03,103
(He accepted his name as Jin, Jin, Jin.)

689
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:05,094
- I couldn't hear you. - It's a zombie movie.

690
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:07,496
- It's a movie on the train. - Zombies?

691
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,913
"Train to Busan".

692
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:12,012
This one is hard. It's a movie about going to...

693
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:13,813
- North Korea. - Ahn Sung Ki and Seol Kyung Gu.

694
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:15,623
- What's the movie? Okay. - "Silmido".

695
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:17,752
What's a recent movie about Queen?

696
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:19,423
- "Bohemian Rhapsody". - Okay.

697
00:25:19,424 --> 00:25:20,552
Can you talk faster?

698
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,522
- There are ghosts in this movie. - Chun Woo Hee.

699
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,292
It stars Chun Woo Hee.

700
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:28,032
- "What's important?" - "What's important?" It's a movie.

701
00:25:28,033 --> 00:25:29,762
- "The Wailing". - Yes.

702
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:34,076
It's a musical movie that takes place in Los Angeles.

703
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:35,843
- "La La Land". - Okay.

704
00:25:35,844 --> 00:25:38,874
It's a movie starring Ma Dong Seok.

705
00:25:39,644 --> 00:25:40,742
"Are you alone?"

706
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:42,113
(Will he...)

707
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:43,613
(succeed?)

708
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:45,113
It's "The"...

709
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:46,813
(He's close to remembering it.)

710
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:47,923
(All he has to say is "Outlaw".)

711
00:25:47,924 --> 00:25:49,823
It's "The"...

712
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,522
(Time is up with one remaining question.)

713
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:54,078
- That was close. - Come on.

714
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:57,492
Hey, I couldn't remember it.

715
00:25:57,493 --> 00:25:59,262
- What happened? - Since he failed,

716
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:00,833
- all of us will vote Seok Jin. - Right.

717
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:03,502
We'll spend half of our ballots to vote for you.

718
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:04,573
(Get ready to be penalized.)

719
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:05,815
- Jong Kook. - What?

720
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,904
My team wants to vote for me too.

721
00:26:09,344 --> 00:26:11,413
They'll vote for me.

722
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:12,742
(Jin is in a lonely fight.)

723
00:26:12,743 --> 00:26:14,813
- Many people plan to vote for me. - Seok Jin.

724
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:17,413
You and Kwang Soo are confirmed.

725
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:18,712
(Kwang Soo stole ballots.)

726
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:21,248
All right. Thank you anyway.

727
00:26:22,023 --> 00:26:24,923
Send me the number of Jin of BTS.

728
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:25,923
(Send me Jin's number.)

729
00:26:25,924 --> 00:26:29,398
It's because you failed, Jin, Jin, Jin.

730
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:31,480
I need to find another Jin.

731
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:33,732
How about Gook Jin?

732
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:35,723
Gook Jin?

733
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:38,697
- Gook Jin. - I'll call him too.

734
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:41,143
- Awesome. - There are many men named Jin.

735
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,873
Send anyone's number whose name is Jin.

736
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,012
- Send them all. - Ask for Joo Byung Jin too.

737
00:26:45,013 --> 00:26:48,548
Seok Jin, do you have Joo Byung Jin's number?

738
00:26:48,884 --> 00:26:49,982
I do.

739
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,982
(I know Byung Jin.)

740
00:26:50,983 --> 00:26:52,383
I know Joo Byung Jin.

741
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:55,514
Send me all of their numbers.

742
00:26:55,654 --> 00:26:57,923
- I'll send them all. - Send me all of them.

743
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,074
- Goodness. - Thank you.

744
00:27:00,523 --> 00:27:03,594
- Joo Byung Jin is Jin too. - He is.

745
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,663
You have to call him Jin, Jin, Jin.

746
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,633
- You should call him mister. - Right.

747
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:10,433
Jin, Jin... Wait.

748
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:12,433
Mr. Jin, Jin, Jin?

749
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:13,633
All the senior colleagues...

750
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,343
I can do it. Hand me the phone.

751
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:18,643
(He calls him nervously.)

752
00:27:18,644 --> 00:27:19,643
Hello?

753
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:21,057
(Someone answered.)

754
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:24,613
- Hello? - Wait, I'm making a tee shot.

755
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:26,012
A tee shot?

756
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,022
- A tee shot? - He's playing golf.

757
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,235
He's at a golf course.

758
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:31,552
(He kneels unconsciously.)

759
00:27:31,553 --> 00:27:34,492
He's more than 40 years older than me.

760
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:35,722
He's your senior comedian.

761
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,188
- He's his direct senior. - That's right.

762
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:40,292
I can't call him Jin, Jin, Jin.

763
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,433
(He feels awkward.)

764
00:27:41,434 --> 00:27:43,888
He'll think it's cute.

765
00:27:44,033 --> 00:27:46,373
- He will. - He will think it's cute.

766
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,384
(His heart is about to burst.)

767
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:49,643
Good shot.

768
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:51,491
Thankfully it was a good shot.

769
00:27:51,543 --> 00:27:54,212
(It's such a relief.)

770
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,628
Thankfully it was a good shot.

771
00:27:56,483 --> 00:27:57,554
It's a relief.

772
00:27:57,983 --> 00:27:59,752
If he made a mistake, I'd be in trouble.

773
00:27:59,753 --> 00:28:01,012
- It was a good shot. - Hello?

774
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,752
- Hello? - Hello, Se Chan.

775
00:28:02,753 --> 00:28:04,522
Mr. Jin, Jin, Jin.

776
00:28:04,523 --> 00:28:07,321
- Hello. - Mr. Jin, Jin, Jin.

777
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:10,123
- Byung Jin, yes. - Have you been well?

778
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:14,234
What do you use to see your face?

779
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:16,833
- A mirror. - That's correct.

780
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:18,894
What do you wear around your neck in the cold?

781
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:20,673
- Scarf. - Thank you, sir.

782
00:28:20,674 --> 00:28:22,319
What do you use when it rains?

783
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,042
- Umbrella. - Thank you, sir.

784
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:26,272
What instrument plays this rhythm?

785
00:28:26,273 --> 00:28:28,042
- It's not kkwaenggwari. - You play it with a drum.

786
00:28:28,043 --> 00:28:29,883
- You play a drum with? - Janggu.

787
00:28:29,884 --> 00:28:33,712
Thank you. What do you use to fry eggs?

788
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,653
- It has a handle. - A frying pan.

789
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:38,093
Thank you. What appliance takes photos?

790
00:28:38,094 --> 00:28:40,175
- Camera in Korean. - How do you say it in English?

791
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:42,123
- Camera. - Thank you.

792
00:28:42,124 --> 00:28:46,274
Sir, thank you. Good shot.

793
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,483
- Good shot. - Byung Jin.

794
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:49,877
Thank you so much, Byung Jin.

795
00:28:50,134 --> 00:28:53,567
We had to find Jin, Jin, Jin.

796
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:57,742
It wasn't easy, but we called you anyway.

797
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:59,042
- I feel honored. - Thank you...

798
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,843
- for participating. - Thank you, sir.

799
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:01,982
You're welcome.

800
00:29:01,983 --> 00:29:04,012
- Yes, have a good day. - Thank you.

801
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,613
- Thank you. - Bye.

802
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:06,712
(We wish you a hole in one.)

803
00:29:06,713 --> 00:29:08,123
- We got it. - We got it.

804
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:11,083
- Let's go to Jin Hair Salon. - Okay.

805
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,537
- Let's go. - Go.

806
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:14,742
- Goodness. - That was funny.

807
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:19,032
Are we randomly selecting our hairstyle?

808
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,563
- The hairstylist will choose. - We'll write names...

809
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:24,089
- on the cards. - I wonder who will be picked.

810
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,302
Think of a hairstyle.

811
00:29:26,303 --> 00:29:28,323
- I thought about it. - It will be two people.

812
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,103
Which one will be fun?

813
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:31,659
Here's a recommendation for Jong Kook.

814
00:29:32,144 --> 00:29:33,742
- Ji Hyo. - The pointy hairstyle?

815
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:34,942
(What do you think?)

816
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:38,286
Wouldn't it look cute on Jong Kook? This hairstyle.

817
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:41,904
Ji Hyo, I'll make your hair like this.

818
00:29:42,424 --> 00:29:43,636
It's Ji Hyo's hair.

819
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E431 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

820
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,764
This is for Ji Hyo. She's pretty.

821
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:52,633
This is fun.

822
00:29:52,634 --> 00:29:55,762
- This is it. - It's a neighborhood's hair salon.

823
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:57,933
- Goodness. - Where are we?

824
00:29:57,934 --> 00:30:00,133
Good shot, good shot.

825
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:01,643
- Hello. - Hello.

826
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:02,643
- It's neat. - Hello.

827
00:30:02,644 --> 00:30:03,742
- Hello. - Welcome.

828
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:06,012
Among the four members,

829
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:09,313
the hairstylist will pick two to change the hair style.

830
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,012
- Okay. - Pick one card.

831
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,613
- Go ahead. - Don't open it yet.

832
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:16,383
- Don't open it. - Just keep it.

833
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:18,323
- Pick one more. - Pick one.

834
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:20,252
- She got them. - All right.

835
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:22,587
She picked them immediately. Let's open...

836
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:25,232
the first card. Get ready.

837
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,093
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

838
00:30:27,094 --> 00:30:28,377
(Who's the first member of honor?)

839
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:29,833
(Se Chan)

840
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:30,844
Okay.

841
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,833
Gosh, I'm picked.

842
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,440
- He's always chosen. - No way.

843
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:40,313
Here's the second one. 1, 2, 3.

844
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:41,324
(Who's the second member?)

845
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,126
Goodness.

846
00:30:43,684 --> 00:30:46,012
(Byul is picked.)

847
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:47,872
How did this happen?

848
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:50,123
Why is it the two of us again?

849
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:53,891
How did the guest and Se Chan get picked?

850
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:55,663
What kind of hairstyle should I get?

851
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,492
For Se Chan, there is a really simple one.

852
00:30:58,493 --> 00:30:59,503
What is it?

853
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:00,804
Strawberry.

854
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:03,063
- Strawberry. - What?

855
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:05,053
- The strawberry hair. - The strawberry hair?

856
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:07,019
Something like this.

857
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,903
It's cute.

858
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:11,442
(Is this even possible?)

859
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:12,929
You'd look so cute.

860
00:31:13,674 --> 00:31:15,913
Can you get...

861
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,207
the Miss Korea hairstyle these days too?

862
00:31:18,384 --> 00:31:19,828
The really voluminous one. You can't get it, right?

863
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,153
- The really big one. - I'm sure she can do it.

864
00:31:22,154 --> 00:31:24,022
Like Tina Turner.

865
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:26,052
- How does that sound? - I'm excited.

866
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,593
I can't believe I'm doing this in Gangwon Province.

867
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:29,734
(A little later)

868
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,151
- Cute. - So lovely.

869
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:33,292
What is this?

870
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:35,788
(Is this a strawberry?)

871
00:31:36,664 --> 00:31:39,936
(It's a mixture of grapes and a strawberry.)

872
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,393
I'm looking forward to this hairstyle.

873
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:44,665
Back in the day, in addition to this hairstyle,

874
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:47,370
didn't they wear purple lipstick?

875
00:31:47,443 --> 00:31:48,683
- Right? - Back then,

876
00:31:48,684 --> 00:31:51,814
they wore very dramatic makeup.

877
00:31:51,884 --> 00:31:53,982
They all wore theatrical makeup.

878
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:56,123
- Kimera too. - Right.

879
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,692
I have such an innocent face, so I'm not sure if it'll work.

880
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:01,521
(She doesn't even change her expression.)

881
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:02,836
Who?

882
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:05,163
Awkward

883
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:07,789
(Awkward)

884
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:11,295
It's become awkward

885
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,591
Do something about it

886
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:16,002
It became so awkward.

887
00:32:16,003 --> 00:32:17,972
(Things you say can make the atmosphere awkward.)

888
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,156
I can't wait.

889
00:32:19,713 --> 00:32:21,042
I like it.

890
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:22,083
(Although the atmosphere had become awkward...)

891
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:23,442
This is crazy.

892
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,613
(The crazy hairstyle brings the mood up.)

893
00:32:24,614 --> 00:32:25,664
Today...

894
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:28,522
Haha will...

895
00:32:28,523 --> 00:32:29,722
(New Miss Korea)

896
00:32:29,723 --> 00:32:30,883
Haha will love it.

897
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:32,741
- Say something as Miss Korea. - Byul.

898
00:32:34,824 --> 00:32:36,022
I'm serious.

899
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:39,262
(After preparing food for 100 people,)

900
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:41,930
(she even got a new hairstyle.)

901
00:32:42,434 --> 00:32:44,702
Thank you, Ms. Byun at Jin Hair Salon.

902
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:49,219
(Thanks to Byul, Team Ji Hyo completes both missions.)

903
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:53,442
(Team Hong Kong arrives at SoHo.)

904
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:54,512
(Crowded)

905
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:55,928
- We're here. - We're here?

906
00:32:55,983 --> 00:32:57,542
(Chow Yun Fat often visits a milk tea place here.)

907
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,028
I guess this is the city center.

908
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:01,623
So Min, we've been here before.

909
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:03,123
Last time, there were no people.

910
00:33:03,124 --> 00:33:04,252
Look at that.

911
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:05,405
- Look. - What?

912
00:33:05,624 --> 00:33:09,129
(This egg tart place had no customers last time.)

913
00:33:09,193 --> 00:33:11,486
(But there's a long line today.)

914
00:33:11,894 --> 00:33:13,449
The line is so long.

915
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:14,933
Film that.

916
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:17,532
Last time, there was no one.

917
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,958
When we went to that egg tart place with Han Na,

918
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,122
there was no line.

919
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:25,913
(Family Special last May)

920
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:29,183
(Han Na took them there, saying it was a popular place.)

921
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:30,813
(There's no line.)

922
00:33:30,814 --> 00:33:32,853
(Empty)

923
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:35,823
(It was empty last time.)

924
00:33:35,824 --> 00:33:38,479
- There was no line last time. - My goodness.

925
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,340
I can't believe it.

926
00:33:40,424 --> 00:33:41,863
- I can't believe it. - How can it be possible?

927
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:44,147
No way. How can there be so many people?

928
00:33:44,624 --> 00:33:46,109
Unbelievable.

929
00:33:46,664 --> 00:33:48,403
(I want some egg tarts.)

930
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:49,702
They're supposed to be very tasty.

931
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:51,333
(These 3 are especially unlucky abroad.)

932
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:53,999
Let's meet Chow Yun Fat...

933
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:55,991
and eat egg tarts.

934
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:57,517
We should meet him.

935
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,643
(They arrive at the milk tea place frequented by Chow Yun Fat.)

936
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:01,724
This must be the place.

937
00:34:02,184 --> 00:34:03,254
This.

938
00:34:03,743 --> 00:34:05,531
- There's a picture. - There's a picture.

939
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:09,282
(There are pictures of Chow Yun Fat on the door.)

940
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:11,515
(He must be a regular customer here.)

941
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:14,353
This place really feels local.

942
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,492
(It's popular among both locals and tourists.)

943
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:20,362
(Chow Yun Fat has been visiting here for 50 years.)

944
00:34:20,363 --> 00:34:21,878
- Chow Yun Fat. - Chow Yun Fat.

945
00:34:22,464 --> 00:34:23,949
There are pictures of him.

946
00:34:24,263 --> 00:34:25,919
- Has he been here today? - Well...

947
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:27,972
Can you ask them if Chow Yun Fat has been here?

948
00:34:27,973 --> 00:34:29,302
(Has he been here today?)

949
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,424
(The local coordinator is asking the owner.)

950
00:34:32,243 --> 00:34:33,313
Has he been here?

951
00:34:33,314 --> 00:34:37,483
(Has Chow Yun Fat been here today?)

952
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:40,612
(Today...)

953
00:34:40,613 --> 00:34:42,253
- He hasn't been here this morning. - No?

954
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,282
When was he here last?

955
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,353
It's been a few days.

956
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:47,753
- A few days? - A few days?

957
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,884
(Too bad.)

958
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,963
- Today... - Who's that?

959
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,307
They must be famous people.

960
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:55,446
That's Alan Tam.

961
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:57,132
- Alan Tam. - Alan Tam.

962
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,426
- Alan Tam. - That's Alan Tam.

963
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,072
- Alan Tam? - Yes.

964
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:03,719
- It's Alan Tam. - It's Alan Tam.

965
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,331
He's a regular here.

966
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,382
How did you get that?

967
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:10,413
- When did she say that? - She said, "He's a regular."

968
00:35:10,414 --> 00:35:12,777
(She said, "He's a regular.")

969
00:35:14,214 --> 00:35:17,859
(He's a regular.)

970
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,052
- She said that. - Gosh.

971
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:21,293
She did.

972
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:22,463
- She said that. - Does she speak Korean?

973
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:23,862
"He's a regular."

974
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:25,833
- I heard it too. - "He's a regular."

975
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,005
"He's a regular."

976
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:29,284
(You should be our regular customers too.)

977
00:35:30,104 --> 00:35:33,202
(They've visited two places, but they haven't met him yet.)

978
00:35:33,203 --> 00:35:36,577
(But there are many other places Chow Yun Fat often visits.)

979
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:39,367
I have a feeling he's having tea somewhere right now.

980
00:35:40,144 --> 00:35:42,709
Where should we go now? Where is he?

981
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:45,296
Where are we headed?

982
00:35:45,453 --> 00:35:48,253
(They end up at...)

983
00:35:48,254 --> 00:35:50,143
As you can see,

984
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,543
Chow Yun Fat's first scene in "A Better Tomorrow" was shot here.

985
00:35:52,624 --> 00:35:54,210
It was shot here?

986
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:59,534
(The legendary first scene was shot here.)

987
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:03,167
(The Toothpick Gang)

988
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:06,373
(Brother, are you ready?)

989
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:09,100
(You can count on me.)

990
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:12,572
(And...)

991
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:15,037
(a passerby)

992
00:36:16,044 --> 00:36:18,652
(Where can we meet Chow Yun Fat?)

993
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:21,178
(If I knew, I wouldn't be here right now.)

994
00:36:22,354 --> 00:36:24,853
(Looking for Chow Yun Fat)

995
00:36:24,854 --> 00:36:26,742
(Toothpick Gang's Crisis)

996
00:36:27,493 --> 00:36:29,322
I really want to meet Chow Yun Fat.

997
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:30,362
- Me too. - Even more now.

998
00:36:30,363 --> 00:36:31,592
I want to meet him.

999
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:32,933
It was a matchstick in the movie.

1000
00:36:32,934 --> 00:36:34,105
Well...

1001
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:36,355
- We should divide the ballots. - Right.

1002
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,817
What game should we play?

1003
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,233
We should play a game to divide the ballots.

1004
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:41,273
Ballots...

1005
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,802
How many ballots should the winner get, 1 or 2?

1006
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:43,972
- 2. - 2.

1007
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:45,072
- 2? - 2.

1008
00:36:45,073 --> 00:36:47,143
(The winner gets 2 ballots.)

1009
00:36:47,144 --> 00:36:48,326
They must be getting married.

1010
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:50,532
The bride looks...

1011
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,367
so happy.

1012
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,674
I'm jealous. I want to get married too.

1013
00:36:55,053 --> 00:36:57,652
I've said I don't have to get married so many times on this show,

1014
00:36:57,653 --> 00:36:59,193
- so I won't be able to. - Why?

1015
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:01,693
I've used up all my luck. I can't get married.

1016
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:02,906
(She chose games over her marriage.)

1017
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:07,433
(She was picking a suitcase.)

1018
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,733
(I don't have to get married. I want to use all my luck today.)

1019
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,902
(Did she have to say that?)

1020
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:16,143
(Everyone tried to stop her, but she used up all her luck.)

1021
00:37:16,144 --> 00:37:19,274
(She didn't mind at that time.)

1022
00:37:19,414 --> 00:37:21,232
Do you really want to get married?

1023
00:37:21,414 --> 00:37:22,828
Seeing those two makes me want to.

1024
00:37:23,644 --> 00:37:24,713
Hi.

1025
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,452
(They ask the couple for help.)

1026
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,999
Let's ask them...

1027
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:29,722
to choose a person who looks happy.

1028
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:31,222
- A person who looks happy. - How does that sound?

1029
00:37:31,223 --> 00:37:33,143
- Okay. - The person who looks the happiest.

1030
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:35,523
We want to wish the couple happiness.

1031
00:37:35,524 --> 00:37:37,422
Number 1 should get 2,

1032
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,833
- and number 2 gets 1. - Number 2 gets 1.

1033
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,611
Please ask them to shake hands with the two people they choose.

1034
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:43,233
The two happiest-looking people.

1035
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:44,819
One by one.

1036
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,352
(Smiling)

1037
00:37:48,874 --> 00:37:51,600
(Innocent smile)

1038
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:55,447
(Fake smile)

1039
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:58,313
(Smiling)

1040
00:37:58,314 --> 00:38:00,131
(He smiles with his eyes.)

1041
00:38:00,414 --> 00:38:02,422
- They'll choose number 2 first. - Number 2.

1042
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,141
The one who looks the second happiest.

1043
00:38:04,524 --> 00:38:06,513
(Who should be number 2?)

1044
00:38:07,024 --> 00:38:08,609
You two look so happy.

1045
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:10,308
Congratulations.

1046
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:12,492
Happy.

1047
00:38:12,493 --> 00:38:13,492
(Number 2 gets 1 ballot.)

1048
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:16,230
(Who will the bride choose?)

1049
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:20,462
(Please come to me.)

1050
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:24,172
(The person who looks pretty happy is...)

1051
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:26,672
(The bride chooses...)

1052
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:30,612
(Jae Seok, not Seok Jin.)

1053
00:38:30,613 --> 00:38:33,112
Thank you.

1054
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:34,700
Thank you. Congratulations.

1055
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:36,253
- Now choose number 1. - Number 1.

1056
00:38:36,254 --> 00:38:37,422
One by one.

1057
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:40,123
(It's time to choose number 1, who will win 2 ballots.)

1058
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:41,222
(Candidate number 1: the fake smile expert)

1059
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:42,607
(Candidate number 2: the innocent smile master)

1060
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:46,132
(The person the groom chooses will get 2 ballots.)

1061
00:38:46,133 --> 00:38:49,262
(Who will the groom choose?)

1062
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:52,632
(This time...)

1063
00:38:52,633 --> 00:38:54,926
(Not this time either.)

1064
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:56,990
(Empty)

1065
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,392
(They shake hands.)

1066
00:38:59,414 --> 00:39:01,494
(So Min wins the 1st place.)

1067
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:03,143
Thank you.

1068
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:04,413
Congratulations.

1069
00:39:04,414 --> 00:39:05,782
Thank you.

1070
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:07,152
(Seok Jin's fake smile didn't fool anyone.)

1071
00:39:07,153 --> 00:39:08,326
Happy wedding.

1072
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:11,083
Why didn't Seok Jin look happy?

1073
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,523
Can you ask them?

1074
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,573
Ask them why Seok Jin didn't look happy.

1075
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:17,793
(Whispering)

1076
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:20,258
"I'm sorry to say this,"

1077
00:39:20,464 --> 00:39:22,686
"Seok Jin's smile..."

1078
00:39:22,703 --> 00:39:25,103
"was pretty too, but the other two smiled so beautifully."

1079
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:29,214
(His smile wasn't as beautiful as the other two's.)

1080
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:31,526
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1081
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:34,213
(So Min wins 2 ballots.)

1082
00:39:34,214 --> 00:39:35,683
- I knew it. - Gosh.

1083
00:39:35,684 --> 00:39:36,713
- I look happy. - Seok Jin...

1084
00:39:36,714 --> 00:39:38,552
- didn't win any. - Did you interpret correctly?

1085
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,433
Did you interpret correctly?

1086
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:41,922
- I have 3. - So Min has 3.

1087
00:39:41,923 --> 00:39:43,083
- I have 3. - I have 5.

1088
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:44,782
- There are only 2 left now. - There are 2 left.

1089
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,944
- You have none, right? - Gosh.

1090
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:48,307
There are only two left?

1091
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,314
I really want to meet Chow Yun Fat.

1092
00:39:52,863 --> 00:39:55,603
If we fail to meet him, all this is pointless.

1093
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:58,262
We'll have failed all missions.

1094
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,556
Should we search "Chow Yun Fat"?

1095
00:40:00,703 --> 00:40:02,420
I'll search the hashtags.

1096
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:04,172
Hashtag, "Chow Yun Fat".

1097
00:40:04,173 --> 00:40:07,443
I think we should have met him this morning.

1098
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:08,625
Hashtag, "Chow Yun Fat".

1099
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,209
One of the hashtag is "Chow Yun Fat's favorite place".

1100
00:40:11,814 --> 00:40:13,097
During lunchtime...

1101
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:15,502
- What is it? - A souffle food truck.

1102
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:18,793
He had lunch at a souffle food truck.

1103
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:20,393
- Is there a picture? - Yes.

1104
00:40:20,394 --> 00:40:21,623
(It's the latest news about Chow Yun Fat.)

1105
00:40:21,624 --> 00:40:23,179
They open at 1pm.

1106
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:25,163
Souffle food truck. Should I search it?

1107
00:40:25,164 --> 00:40:26,362
We should go there right now.

1108
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:27,475
At 1pm?

1109
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:31,362
(Based on the information on social media,)

1110
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:33,827
(they move from the milk tea place to the souffle food truck.)

1111
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:37,202
- It's over there. - Over there?

1112
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:38,643
- Where? This? - This?

1113
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,432
- This is... - This is the place?

1114
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:41,672
It looks tasty.

1115
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:43,612
(They arrive at the souffle food truck.)

1116
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,200
(Surprised)

1117
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:50,183
(The local people love this souffle food truck.)

1118
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:53,452
(Does he comes and get this sweet and fulffy souffle often?)

1119
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,665
What's that?

1120
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:56,023
- Hello. - It looks delicious.

1121
00:40:56,024 --> 00:40:57,023
Hi.

1122
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,609
Chow Yun Fat?

1123
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:00,663
- Chow Yun Fat. - Chow Yun Fat?

1124
00:41:00,664 --> 00:41:03,430
- Chow Yun Fat? - Chow Yun Fat.

1125
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:08,742
(It's a recent photo with Chow Yun Fat.)

1126
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:13,713
(Will they find Chow Yun Fat's whereabouts?)

1127
00:41:13,714 --> 00:41:14,943
- There's no photo of his. - He came last month.

1128
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:15,983
Did he drink bubble tea?

1129
00:41:15,984 --> 00:41:18,282
Apparently he came last month.

1130
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:19,465
- Last month? - Last month?

1131
00:41:20,283 --> 00:41:22,052
- It was last month. - He came last month.

1132
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,552
(They fail to find Chow Yun Fat.)

1133
00:41:23,553 --> 00:41:27,353
Is it okay to find food without finding him?

1134
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,818
Look for Chow Yun Fat.

1135
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,592
Who knows if he's around?

1136
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:34,893
What if we meet Chow Yun Fat miraculously?

1137
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:36,044
That would be...

1138
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:37,503
- I will immediately... - the best.

1139
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:39,089
turn on that music.

1140
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,323
I would play it right away.

1141
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:43,902
I wish we could meet Chow Yun Fat.

1142
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:45,761
(He wants to meet him once.)

1143
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:48,413
Isn't this Jae Seok?

1144
00:41:48,414 --> 00:41:49,857
(Isn't this Jae Seok?)

1145
00:41:50,314 --> 00:41:52,203
This souffle looks delicious.

1146
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:55,171
- It's Jae Seok. - Me?

1147
00:41:55,423 --> 00:41:56,782
I'm on it too.

1148
00:41:56,783 --> 00:41:58,722
- It's Jae Seok. - I thought it was him.

1149
00:41:58,723 --> 00:42:00,492
I thought it was me too. I was startled.

1150
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:01,623
He looks exactly like you.

1151
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:03,644
- He looks exactly like you. - You look the same.

1152
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:06,258
Listen up, everyone.

1153
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:09,463
Remember the owner of the porridge restaurant?

1154
00:42:09,464 --> 00:42:11,463
We got a call from him.

1155
00:42:11,464 --> 00:42:14,003
About 10 minutes away from the porridge restaurant,

1156
00:42:14,004 --> 00:42:16,373
there's a herbal medicine shop. He just arrived.

1157
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:17,802
- Just now? - Yes.

1158
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:19,413
(Chow Yun Fat appeared.)

1159
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:22,483
(He's finally here.)

1160
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:23,683
Let's go now.

1161
00:42:23,684 --> 00:42:24,683
Let's hurry.

1162
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:25,782
Is it next to the porridge restaurant?

1163
00:42:25,783 --> 00:42:27,782
- It's unbelievable. Is it real? - Really?

1164
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:29,822
- He's been staying around there. - An herbal medicine shop?

1165
00:42:29,823 --> 00:42:31,583
- It's therapeutic. - He should take care of his health.

1166
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:33,023
That's right.

1167
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,753
- Let's go now. - Let's hurry.

1168
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:35,905
Let's go.

1169
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:40,778
(They go from a souffle food truck to Kowloon Market.)

1170
00:42:41,493 --> 00:42:43,603
Will we really meet him?

1171
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:44,963
Meeting Chow Yun Fat will be amazing.

1172
00:42:44,964 --> 00:42:46,902
A minute ago, he bought some vegetables.

1173
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,166
Let's go to the vegetable market.

1174
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,543
Okay.

1175
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:52,342
- What's going on? - Did he leave?

1176
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:53,455
Did he leave again?

1177
00:42:53,814 --> 00:42:55,025
Where is he?

1178
00:42:55,914 --> 00:42:56,983
Where is he?

1179
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:58,143
(Where is he?)

1180
00:42:58,144 --> 00:43:01,113
(They're in a hurry to find him.)

1181
00:43:01,314 --> 00:43:02,422
Where is he?

1182
00:43:02,423 --> 00:43:04,052
(They enter the market where Chow Yun Fat is.)

1183
00:43:04,053 --> 00:43:05,652
Did Chow Yun Fat buy vegetables?

1184
00:43:05,653 --> 00:43:07,845
- He bought produce. - He bought produce.

1185
00:43:08,624 --> 00:43:10,239
Is it this way?

1186
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:12,563
- Where is it? - Over here.

1187
00:43:12,564 --> 00:43:13,907
(Is it this vegetable market?)

1188
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,467
(Chow Yun Fat is inside this market.)

1189
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:19,549
Is that Chow Yun Fat?

1190
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:23,472
(Did they finally find Chow Yun Fat?)

1191
00:43:23,644 --> 00:43:25,612
(Will they meet...)

1192
00:43:25,613 --> 00:43:29,179
(Chow Yun Fat?)

1193
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:31,813
Is that Chow Yun Fat?

1194
00:43:31,814 --> 00:43:34,083
- Is Chow Yun Fat here? - Chow Yun Fat.

1195
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:35,639
(Chow Yun Fat)

1196
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:40,193
(They ask the owner of the vegetable market his whereabouts.)

1197
00:43:40,194 --> 00:43:41,922
(She keeps answering.)

1198
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:44,419
He stopped by and left just now.

1199
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:47,862
- Where did he go? - Where did he go?

1200
00:43:47,863 --> 00:43:49,402
(They're in a hurry.)

1201
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:51,990
- Ma'am, where did he go? - Where did he go?

1202
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,742
(She speaks in Chinese.)

1203
00:43:55,743 --> 00:43:56,802
(What is she saying?)

1204
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:59,143
She thinks that he went home.

1205
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:01,773
(She thinks that he went home.)

1206
00:44:01,774 --> 00:44:06,213
(Did Chow Yun Fat go home?)

1207
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:10,452
(She wants to show them something from the corner.)

1208
00:44:10,453 --> 00:44:13,793
(He's a regular customer at this place as well.)

1209
00:44:13,794 --> 00:44:15,123
We just missed him again.

1210
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:16,880
- We just missed him. - We were so close.

1211
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,733
- Let's disperse. - Okay.

1212
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:22,233
- Let's go around once. - Okay.

1213
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:23,233
Let's go separately.

1214
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:25,163
- He might be nearby. - If...

1215
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,933
- If you find Chow Yun Fat, - Yes.

1216
00:44:26,934 --> 00:44:29,342
- Call each other. - be careful with the camera.

1217
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:31,242
Ask politely for his permission.

1218
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:32,742
Okay, I will.

1219
00:44:32,743 --> 00:44:34,936
Shouldn't we check the bus stop?

1220
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:37,232
Or near a subway station?

1221
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,233
We have to meet him.

1222
00:44:39,814 --> 00:44:41,369
After all we've done,

1223
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:43,802
it'd be great to finally meet Chow Yun Fat.

1224
00:44:44,823 --> 00:44:47,693
(He looks for a herbal medicine shop.)

1225
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:51,193
Apparently Chow Yun Fat comes to buy herbal medicine.

1226
00:44:51,194 --> 00:44:52,693
(I heard Chow Yun Fat came near an herbal medicine shop.)

1227
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:55,764
(Have you seen Chow Yun Fat?)

1228
00:44:56,064 --> 00:44:58,659
(Chow Yun Fat?)

1229
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:00,045
He didn't see him today.

1230
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:01,515
He didn't?

1231
00:45:01,604 --> 00:45:04,503
(He didn't see him today.)

1232
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,393
I wonder if he stops by here.

1233
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:08,633
(Where are you, Chow Yun Fat?)

1234
00:45:08,814 --> 00:45:10,413
(She searches an alleyway across from the market.)

1235
00:45:10,414 --> 00:45:12,373
I wish we'd meet him miraculously.

1236
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:14,183
If it's meant to be...

1237
00:45:14,184 --> 00:45:15,213
(So Min and Chow Yun Fat)

1238
00:45:15,214 --> 00:45:16,699
Even for a little while...

1239
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:19,714
If he appeared at a place like this,

1240
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:21,722
I would be so moved.

1241
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:23,193
(He searches inside the market again.)

1242
00:45:23,194 --> 00:45:25,193
(Where is Chow Yun Fat?)

1243
00:45:25,194 --> 00:45:26,305
Is he here?

1244
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,653
I think he's nearby.

1245
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:32,163
What?

1246
00:45:32,164 --> 00:45:33,952
(What?)

1247
00:45:34,903 --> 00:45:36,103
(He passes by a restaurant.)

1248
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:37,214
Isn't that Chow Yun Fat?

1249
00:45:37,573 --> 00:45:40,574
It is Chow Yun Fat indeed.

1250
00:45:41,214 --> 00:45:42,713
He was here too.

1251
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:43,926
(It's another restaurant where he comes.)

1252
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,853
Isn't it Chow Yun Fat?

1253
00:45:46,854 --> 00:45:50,116
(Does the restaurant owner know his whereabouts?)

1254
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,820
(Have you seen Chow Yun Fat?)

1255
00:45:54,823 --> 00:45:57,023
He came by a long time ago.

1256
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,523
(She can hardly remember.)

1257
00:45:58,524 --> 00:46:00,233
(He fails to find Chow Yun Fat.)

1258
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:02,930
He was here. He must come here often.

1259
00:46:03,903 --> 00:46:05,145
This is disappointing.

1260
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,019
He must be around here somewhere.

1261
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:10,579
(Where is Chow Yun Fat?)

1262
00:46:11,073 --> 00:46:12,413
There they are.

1263
00:46:12,414 --> 00:46:13,413
(Their search time is over.)

1264
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:15,242
- So Min is coming. - She's coming.

1265
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:16,342
She didn't find him either.

1266
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:18,000
Jae Seok, Seok Jin.

1267
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:19,253
What?

1268
00:46:19,254 --> 00:46:20,512
(Did you find him?)

1269
00:46:20,513 --> 00:46:21,583
- You didn't find him, right? - Jae Seok.

1270
00:46:21,584 --> 00:46:23,183
- Did you take photos? - You didn't find him, right?

1271
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:24,253
(I see failure written on your face.)

1272
00:46:24,254 --> 00:46:25,722
I saw you walking from over there.

1273
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:26,834
(I didn't find him.)

1274
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,983
All right, everyone.

1275
00:46:29,863 --> 00:46:32,362
- You failed to clear the mission. - I know.

1276
00:46:32,363 --> 00:46:35,063
Due to your flight, you must go to the airport now.

1277
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,478
You know what?

1278
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,463
We never cleared a mission while being abroad.

1279
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,543
Is it true that he was just at the market?

1280
00:46:43,544 --> 00:46:44,643
I know.

1281
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:46,865
(We hope to see you next time.)

1282
00:46:49,814 --> 00:46:53,045
(It's the last night of Year End Race.)

1283
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:55,253
(It's time to tally the result.)

1284
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:57,648
It's very cold.

1285
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:01,225
Team Hong Kong must have worked hard.

1286
00:47:01,593 --> 00:47:03,816
Did you clear the mission today?

1287
00:47:03,894 --> 00:47:05,004
Who?

1288
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,433
- Your mission today. - Us?

1289
00:47:06,434 --> 00:47:08,592
Let's keep it a secret for now.

1290
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:10,963
Depending on whether you cleared it or not,

1291
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:12,063
the number of members is determined.

1292
00:47:12,064 --> 00:47:14,426
Don't be curious, Kwang Soo.

1293
00:47:14,434 --> 00:47:16,842
- Why not? - Don't you realize what you did?

1294
00:47:16,843 --> 00:47:18,443
- You'll be picked anyway. - Me?

1295
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,242
- Of course. - Thank you for your letter.

1296
00:47:20,243 --> 00:47:22,335
- Thank you for your letter. - Thank you.

1297
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:24,012
What do you mean?

1298
00:47:24,013 --> 00:47:25,753
Blame me only if you're confident.

1299
00:47:25,754 --> 00:47:28,511
- What? He's gotten strange. - He's strange.

1300
00:47:29,323 --> 00:47:31,848
If your name tag in your jacket, Si Young?

1301
00:47:31,883 --> 00:47:33,222
My name tag?

1302
00:47:33,223 --> 00:47:34,293
You're right.

1303
00:47:34,294 --> 00:47:36,183
- Doesn't she have a name tag? - Shall I help you?

1304
00:47:36,694 --> 00:47:39,088
Did you take off each other's name tag in the van?

1305
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:40,762
We did everything.

1306
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:41,976
We did all.

1307
00:47:42,703 --> 00:47:44,733
- Did you eliminate name tags? - What are you doing?

1308
00:47:44,734 --> 00:47:45,802
What are you doing?

1309
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:46,902
What is he doing?

1310
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:48,072
(Laughing)

1311
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,518
Wait, Si Young.

1312
00:47:49,604 --> 00:47:51,764
(While they're looking for her name tag,)

1313
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:54,641
(he steals her ballots.)

1314
00:47:55,814 --> 00:47:57,501
(He takes her ballots.)

1315
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:00,152
(His method gets more daring in the cold.)

1316
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,072
(Shaking her head)

1317
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:04,753
(Kwang Soo with skilled hands)

1318
00:48:04,754 --> 00:48:05,865
Thank you.

1319
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:08,793
- All right. - Did you stick it on?

1320
00:48:08,794 --> 00:48:09,976
Yes.

1321
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:11,722
(Si Young gets betrayed in the open.)

1322
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:13,209
That was incredible.

1323
00:48:13,694 --> 00:48:15,209
It's unbelievable.

1324
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:16,945
Seriously.

1325
00:48:17,803 --> 00:48:19,373
(Be quiet, it might hurt you.)

1326
00:48:19,374 --> 00:48:20,373
Se Chan.

1327
00:48:20,374 --> 00:48:21,402
How could you?

1328
00:48:21,403 --> 00:48:22,454
Goodness.

1329
00:48:25,714 --> 00:48:27,531
(Where are my ballots?)

1330
00:48:27,743 --> 00:48:29,229
(Punching)

1331
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:34,081
(Her punch punishes Kwang Soo.)

1332
00:48:36,084 --> 00:48:38,952
(Kwang Soo, you're giving me such a hard time.)

1333
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,175
My goodness.

1334
00:48:43,524 --> 00:48:47,063
This isn't the first time. What's wrong with him?

1335
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:48,710
Stop it, no.

1336
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:52,193
Stop it, no. No.

1337
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:53,543
You will lose.

1338
00:48:55,274 --> 00:48:56,273
You said no.

1339
00:48:56,274 --> 00:48:58,668
(Come and get me.)

1340
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:00,612
Gosh.

1341
00:49:00,613 --> 00:49:03,977
(She's counting her ballot.)

1342
00:49:06,414 --> 00:49:08,083
(Grunting)

1343
00:49:08,084 --> 00:49:10,345
What's wrong with you, Kwang Soo?

1344
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:11,583
Look at Kwang Soo.

1345
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:12,634
(She finally laughs after counting her ballot.)

1346
00:49:12,923 --> 00:49:13,992
Look.

1347
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,092
Look at Kwang Soo.

1348
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,163
(Disappointed)

1349
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,293
(I almost got away with it.)

1350
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:19,833
You're back.

1351
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:21,592
- You're back. - You're back.

1352
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:22,675
Where did you go?

1353
00:49:22,734 --> 00:49:24,003
It was cold.

1354
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:25,075
It was hilarious.

1355
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:27,802
You worked hard. Good job.

1356
00:49:27,803 --> 00:49:29,003
You finished...

1357
00:49:29,004 --> 00:49:31,302
Year End Special, Losers Bracket Race.

1358
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:32,543
Good job, everyone.

1359
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:34,736
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1360
00:49:35,044 --> 00:49:36,356
Good job.

1361
00:49:36,383 --> 00:49:40,049
Thanks to team leader Si Young and special guest Byul,

1362
00:49:40,153 --> 00:49:42,353
both teams cleared all the missions.

1363
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,422
Really?

1364
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,952
- Did you clear all of them? - Goodness.

1365
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:46,452
- That's amazing. - That's amazing.

1366
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:47,523
That's impressive.

1367
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:48,853
She's better than her husband.

1368
00:49:48,854 --> 00:49:51,193
For Si Young,

1369
00:49:51,194 --> 00:49:53,689
we have a present for her baby who will turn one soon.

1370
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:57,638
We'll give R Ring to Byul.

1371
00:49:58,604 --> 00:50:00,202
(Gold R Ring and a ring for one-year birthday)

1372
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:01,446
That's great.

1373
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:04,471
(Is my husband watching this?)

1374
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,873
To fit his finger?

1375
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,342
(Si Young gets a ring for her son.)

1376
00:50:08,343 --> 00:50:11,713
However, Team So Min failed both missions.

1377
00:50:11,714 --> 00:50:13,983
(Team So Min failed both missions.)

1378
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:15,382
What will happen now?

1379
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:18,253
They need to take responsibility.

1380
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:20,616
Two members will be penalized.

1381
00:50:21,294 --> 00:50:24,757
They will be two with the highest votes.

1382
00:50:24,923 --> 00:50:26,532
Did you bring your ballots?

1383
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:27,675
- Yes. - Yes.

1384
00:50:27,794 --> 00:50:29,005
Let's check.

1385
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:30,362
How did that happen?

1386
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:31,748
I feel bad for Seok Jin.

1387
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,672
- We have... - Two in common.

1388
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:35,172
- We have two ballots. - They're in common.

1389
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,842
They played dirty again.

1390
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:39,590
Si Young has 10 ballots.

1391
00:50:40,144 --> 00:50:42,235
(They start to vote whom to penalize.)

1392
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:44,359
Stay out if you don't have ballots.

1393
00:50:45,644 --> 00:50:47,270
Why do the three of us never have any?

1394
00:50:47,283 --> 00:50:49,083
- What do you mean? - My goodness.

1395
00:50:49,084 --> 00:50:51,253
(They never have anything.)

1396
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:53,111
I don't understand why.

1397
00:50:54,323 --> 00:50:56,422
- Whose name should I write? - Who should I write?

1398
00:50:56,423 --> 00:50:58,092
(The members hesitate in the voting booth.)

1399
00:50:58,093 --> 00:50:59,478
I only have four ballots.

1400
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:01,605
Who should I write?

1401
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:05,939
It's too cruel to give all the votes to one person.

1402
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:09,503
(Si Young enters the booth.)

1403
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:11,797
Kwang Soo...

1404
00:51:12,104 --> 00:51:14,397
worked so hard with me. I can't forget about it.

1405
00:51:17,044 --> 00:51:18,683
I don't know what to do.

1406
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,253
Those who failed...

1407
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:21,931
Oh, gosh.

1408
00:51:22,484 --> 00:51:23,853
I'll announce the results.

1409
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:25,893
(He announces the people chosen for the punishments.)

1410
00:51:25,894 --> 00:51:28,523
First of all, this is second place.

1411
00:51:28,524 --> 00:51:30,483
- This person received 12 votes. - What?

1412
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:33,690
- 12 votes? - Isn't that all the votes?

1413
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:36,633
Second place, Lee Kwang Soo.

1414
00:51:37,004 --> 00:51:38,503
Isn't that almost all the votes?

1415
00:51:38,504 --> 00:51:40,927
How come Kwang Soo gets punished every week?

1416
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:44,104
What did you do to deserve it?

1417
00:51:44,303 --> 00:51:45,556
Out of 35 votes,

1418
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,261
he received 21 votes.

1419
00:51:49,513 --> 00:51:50,842
That's almost everybody.

1420
00:51:50,843 --> 00:51:52,083
(Who got 1st place?)

1421
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:54,104
You instinctively thought that it's you.

1422
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:55,483
No, it's not me.

1423
00:51:55,484 --> 00:51:57,574
People thought I was going to have many votes, so they didn't pick me.

1424
00:51:58,053 --> 00:52:00,623
- There's a twist. - They had an overwhelming win...

1425
00:52:00,624 --> 00:52:02,715
- There's a twist. - over Kwang Soo.

1426
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:05,463
- Do we have a champion? - There's a twist.

1427
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:06,979
(Who has the most number of votes?)

1428
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:09,902
It's Jee Seok Jin.

1429
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:12,591
- It's Jee Seok Jin. - You're so cool!

1430
00:52:13,434 --> 00:52:15,103
(Teasing)

1431
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:17,003
- If he kept his mouth shut... - What's cool?

1432
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:20,104
MVP. You're the MVP.

1433
00:52:20,973 --> 00:52:22,913
- He's cool. - This is the best way to lose.

1434
00:52:22,914 --> 00:52:23,983
(Seok Jin wants all the attention.)

1435
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:25,313
It's okay.

1436
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:27,979
You wrote my name, right? You too.

1437
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:29,722
(Yes, I did.)

1438
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:31,253
- You did, right? - But...

1439
00:52:31,254 --> 00:52:32,253
- I'm going to watch this episode. - we couldn't...

1440
00:52:32,254 --> 00:52:34,492
write people from the other teams.

1441
00:52:34,493 --> 00:52:36,693
- We had no choice. - We couldn't do much.

1442
00:52:36,694 --> 00:52:39,320
I felt bad while writing your name down.

1443
00:52:39,363 --> 00:52:40,878
(I'm sorry, Seok Jin.)

1444
00:52:40,934 --> 00:52:44,136
Si Young, how was today for you?

1445
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:46,632
Thank you for inviting me.

1446
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:50,472
If I was on a different team,

1447
00:52:50,473 --> 00:52:51,472
(For example, a team without Kwang Soo.)

1448
00:52:51,473 --> 00:52:55,251
I think I would have been nicer,

1449
00:52:55,374 --> 00:52:57,302
so I'm a little sad about that.

1450
00:52:57,714 --> 00:52:59,299
(She must have had a hard time.)

1451
00:52:59,383 --> 00:53:02,283
And I really hope that...

1452
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:04,945
Kwang Soo recovers.

1453
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:06,152
The illness of the mind.

1454
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:09,152
I'm going to root for him from far away.

1455
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:12,194
I'm going be honest because the voting is over.

1456
00:53:12,294 --> 00:53:15,092
Kwang Soo has a problem, but she has one too.

1457
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:16,820
(He makes a revelation.)

1458
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:18,579
- It's serious. - She has no patience.

1459
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:20,183
It's serious.

1460
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:21,702
(They all had a hard time.)

1461
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:23,103
Today's punishment is...

1462
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:24,103
(The punishment for Year End Special is...)

1463
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:25,342
whipped cream bomb.

1464
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:26,728
I'm going to take a revenge.

1465
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:30,983
I'm going to take a revenge. You, So Min... No, Ji Hyo...

1466
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:32,499
Why me?

1467
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,683
- Why are you doing that to me? - We were on the same team.

1468
00:53:34,684 --> 00:53:37,007
Fine. Let's plan something.

1469
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:38,683
Kwang Soo. Goodness.

1470
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:40,440
We have to do it next week.

1471
00:53:40,894 --> 00:53:42,353
Poor Seok Jin.

1472
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:43,707
In one,

1473
00:53:44,164 --> 00:53:46,385
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1474
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:48,755
(The whipped cream is launched.)

1475
00:53:51,164 --> 00:53:52,262
(The white whipped cream splatters on their faces.)

1476
00:53:52,263 --> 00:53:54,702
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1477
00:53:54,703 --> 00:53:56,491
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

1478
00:53:57,604 --> 00:54:00,512
(A week later)

1479
00:54:00,513 --> 00:54:03,512
I was so mad.

1480
00:54:03,513 --> 00:54:06,253
What did we do to deserve it? We were just working hard.

1481
00:54:06,254 --> 00:54:08,475
- Am I guilty for trying too hard? - Are we?

1482
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:11,282
Here's an opportunity for you to take a revenge.

1483
00:54:11,283 --> 00:54:12,793
(Here's an opportunity for you to take a revenge.)

1484
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,480
(They finally have a chance to get even.)

1485
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:18,997
(They waited for this day!)

1486
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:24,601
In a moment, we'll start Christmas Special Couple Race.

1487
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:28,503
You need to complete a secret mission...

1488
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:30,202
without getting caught.

1489
00:54:30,203 --> 00:54:33,305
(They must complete a secret mission during Christmas Special.)

1490
00:54:35,143 --> 00:54:37,013
For this race,

1491
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:39,352
one of your identities...

1492
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:41,852
will be revealed during the intro.

1493
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:43,481
(What kind of a mission is it?)

1494
00:54:45,344 --> 00:54:47,212
For this race,

1495
00:54:47,213 --> 00:54:49,542
one of your identities...

1496
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:52,077
will be revealed during the intro.

1497
00:54:52,078 --> 00:54:55,933
(One of their identities will be revealed during the intro.)

1498
00:54:56,595 --> 00:55:00,034
What? What do you mean? I don't think I understand.

1499
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,134
Do you want us to succeed or not?

1500
00:55:02,185 --> 00:55:04,214
We're spies, but you're telling the others?

1501
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:05,214
You're telling them?

1502
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:08,790
Please decide whose identity you'll reveal first.

1503
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:11,593
I choose Seok Jin.

1504
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:13,394
- I choose Kwang Soo. - No, I choose him.

1505
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,778
I choose Kwang Soo.

1506
00:55:15,094 --> 00:55:16,711
What's this supposed to be?

1507
00:55:16,965 --> 00:55:18,682
Do you want us to succeed?

1508
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:21,863
This might be a good thing because if one of us gets revealed,

1509
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:24,259
then people won't think we're a team.

1510
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:27,504
It's doomed to failure.

1511
00:55:27,505 --> 00:55:29,090
(It looks like the staff gave up on the Year End Special.)

1512
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:31,157
This is Christmas Special.

1513
00:55:31,315 --> 00:55:34,214
If I know you're a spy, I'll be suspicious of Jong Kook.

1514
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:35,214
(The weakest person should be partnered with somebody strong.)

1515
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:37,214
Of course. Or Jae Seok.

1516
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,184
- You're good at that kind of thing. - Right.

1517
00:55:39,185 --> 00:55:41,723
You're good at framing people. Okay, I'll reveal my identity.

1518
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:44,321
I think that's right. I'll sacrifice myself.

1519
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:45,493
(The winning strategy for the weakest team is...)

1520
00:55:45,494 --> 00:55:47,124
I'm volunteering myself.

1521
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:48,124
I know.

1522
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:50,763
- That's how desperate I am. - I know.

1523
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:52,047
(Will their revenge be a success?)

1524
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:56,064
(30 minutes later...)

1525
00:55:56,065 --> 00:55:59,539
(This place is filled with the Christmas spirit.)

1526
00:56:00,344 --> 00:56:01,504
(Running Man's 2018 Christmas party starts.)

1527
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,473
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

1528
00:56:03,474 --> 00:56:06,044
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

1529
00:56:06,045 --> 00:56:07,883
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

1530
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:10,013
- And happy new year! - Merry Christmas!

1531
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:12,283
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

1532
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:14,283
- The cakes look so good. - This is awesome.

1533
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:15,553
Can we eat these? Okay.

1534
00:56:15,554 --> 00:56:17,008
Do you know this?

1535
00:56:17,954 --> 00:56:19,964
(The light on the tree comes on.)

1536
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:22,014
The old people are fascinated.

1537
00:56:22,324 --> 00:56:23,546
What's this?

1538
00:56:24,034 --> 00:56:25,863
- Let's eat. - How do we eat this?

1539
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:27,234
What flavor is this?

1540
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:29,734
- Well... - It's Christmas,

1541
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:31,734
- so Jae Seok... - I...

1542
00:56:31,735 --> 00:56:33,144
- is being funny with his glasses. - It's been a while.

1543
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:34,604
What's up with your glasses?

1544
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:36,843
- I wore big glasses. - Why?

1545
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:39,013
Are your eye sights worse?

1546
00:56:39,014 --> 00:56:41,383
These glasses are perfect for this fashion.

1547
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:43,684
- Is that fashion? - Yes, it is.

1548
00:56:43,685 --> 00:56:45,854
- Why are they so thick? - I...

1549
00:56:45,855 --> 00:56:47,953
(Why are they so thick if it's fashion?)

1550
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,184
I have bad eye sights.

1551
00:56:49,185 --> 00:56:51,194
His eyes look this small.

1552
00:56:51,195 --> 00:56:52,953
I thought it was Magic Eye.

1553
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:55,363
- His eye sights are so bad. - Wear contact lenses then.

1554
00:56:55,364 --> 00:56:57,294
- I have bad eye sights. - Wear contact lenses.

1555
00:56:57,295 --> 00:56:59,689
- It's okay if they're thinner. - I know.

1556
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:02,303
- What's on your shirt? - We were supposed to...

1557
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:04,133
- dress for the season. - Right.

1558
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:05,604
Did you design this at home?

1559
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:07,774
- No, this sweater is like that. - Really?

1560
00:57:07,775 --> 00:57:09,936
I got here early,

1561
00:57:10,074 --> 00:57:12,843
and So Min parked next to me.

1562
00:57:12,844 --> 00:57:16,419
I called her name, and her manager rolled down the window.

1563
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:17,866
She was...

1564
00:57:19,014 --> 00:57:20,024
She was...

1565
00:57:20,025 --> 00:57:21,084
(So Min was out.)

1566
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:22,499
The saliva...

1567
00:57:22,585 --> 00:57:24,553
She had a black jacket...

1568
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:26,394
- You should have taken a picture. - Yesterday...

1569
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:28,923
I slept late, and she posted something suspicious.

1570
00:57:28,924 --> 00:57:31,363
- What did she post? - What did she post on social media?

1571
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,564
What did she post?

1572
00:57:32,565 --> 00:57:33,664
Was it something special?

1573
00:57:33,665 --> 00:57:35,564
Was it "There's 20 percent left"?

1574
00:57:35,565 --> 00:57:39,104
She took a screenshot when her phone battery had 20 percent left...

1575
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:40,403
- "My soul is..." - "My heart is..."

1576
00:57:40,404 --> 00:57:42,044
No, "There's 20 percent left in my heart too."

1577
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,227
(Was she emotional?)

1578
00:57:43,574 --> 00:57:44,814
What was that?

1579
00:57:44,815 --> 00:57:47,243
That's why she was drooling.

1580
00:57:47,244 --> 00:57:49,214
I almost gave her an online gift.

1581
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,396
(She had 20 percent left inside and 20 percent of energy left.)

1582
00:57:51,114 --> 00:57:52,714
Why are you so emotional?

1583
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,953
- What is it? - What is it?

1584
00:57:53,954 --> 00:57:55,184
(Peeking)

1585
00:57:55,185 --> 00:57:56,234
What is that?

1586
00:57:56,695 --> 00:57:58,754
- Who drew that? - I think Dream did.

1587
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:01,093
No, it's not his. He can't draw like that.

1588
00:58:01,094 --> 00:58:02,363
(There are portraits of the 8 Running Man members.)

1589
00:58:02,364 --> 00:58:04,111
- What's this? - This is pretty high level.

1590
00:58:04,235 --> 00:58:06,363
This looks exactly like Jae Seok. This is good.

1591
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:07,934
Jae Seok is on the very left, right?

1592
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:09,722
(Is this Jae Seok?)

1593
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:12,703
(His mouth is protruding, and his hair is parted on the side.)

1594
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:14,219
That looks exactly like Jae Seok.

1595
00:58:14,844 --> 00:58:16,104
Who is this ghost?

1596
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:17,113
(Who is this lady ghost?)

1597
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:18,473
Isn't that Ji Hyo?

1598
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:19,513
- Is that me? - It's Ji Hyo.

1599
00:58:19,514 --> 00:58:21,113
Are those eyes? Not glasses?

1600
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:22,714
- She's... - She has big eyes.

1601
00:58:22,715 --> 00:58:24,168
bleeding from the ears.

1602
00:58:24,284 --> 00:58:25,914
(Is that me?)

1603
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:27,923
Is this me? I think it is.

1604
00:58:27,924 --> 00:58:29,369
It's you.

1605
00:58:29,654 --> 00:58:31,294
- Your mouth... - Is that a mouth?

1606
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,354
Hey, Jong Kook has sharp teeth.

1607
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:36,817
He has sharp teeth.

1608
00:58:36,994 --> 00:58:39,388
- Look at this. - Is this me?

1609
00:58:39,594 --> 00:58:41,363
- Look at your nose. - Why are my eyes so small?

1610
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:42,504
You have a big nose.

1611
00:58:42,505 --> 00:58:44,150
(He looks exactly like Seok Jin.)

1612
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:46,794
Why did they draw me like this?

1613
00:58:47,605 --> 00:58:48,944
I thought I was Haha.

1614
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,389
- Seok Jin. - Haha has the mustache.

1615
00:58:50,514 --> 00:58:53,013
- That looks like Haha. - I recognized it right away.

1616
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:55,408
This is Dong Hoon. Is this me then?

1617
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:57,484
This is Kwang Soo.

1618
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:59,505
He has a long face.

1619
00:58:59,585 --> 00:59:00,984
Asia Prince.

1620
00:59:00,985 --> 00:59:03,084
Why don't I have eyebrows?

1621
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,569
So Min...

1622
00:59:05,094 --> 00:59:06,723
So Min, why is your forehead so wide?

1623
00:59:06,724 --> 00:59:08,493
Ji Hyo, I don't have eyebrows, and my eyes are small.

1624
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:10,514
So Min, your forehead is so small.

1625
00:59:12,235 --> 00:59:14,403
Se Chan only has a mouth.

1626
00:59:14,404 --> 00:59:17,132
(Today's finale is Se Chan of course.)

1627
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,303
They didn't even draw me a nose.

1628
00:59:19,304 --> 00:59:20,903
- I don't even have a nose. - Se Chan looks the most alike.

1629
00:59:20,904 --> 00:59:22,374
I don't have a nose.

1630
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,869
- Why did you get Se Chan's photo? - What's wrong with mine?

1631
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,984
Everybody else has drawings. Why does he get a photo?

1632
00:59:26,985 --> 00:59:29,484
When Joy and Irene were here,

1633
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:32,013
we had the photo-shopped pictures. Se Chan's are still on the internet.

1634
00:59:32,014 --> 00:59:33,383
- They are. - Really?

1635
00:59:33,384 --> 00:59:35,343
- Yes. - Those are dark pictures.

1636
00:59:35,724 --> 00:59:37,624
That looks like Se Chan.

1637
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:38,967
(The 4 of them have their gums showing.)

1638
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:40,493
What about these drawings?

1639
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:42,081
- Who drew them? - The drawings...

1640
00:59:42,594 --> 00:59:44,934
are done by seven-year-old children.

1641
00:59:44,935 --> 00:59:47,531
They drew it from their point of view.

1642
00:59:47,735 --> 00:59:49,219
- Thank you. - This is good.

1643
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,203
This is good for seven-year-olds.

1644
00:59:51,204 --> 00:59:52,346
(These are really good!)

1645
00:59:52,435 --> 00:59:54,944
(Thank you to Class Blue of Janice Kindergarten!)

1646
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:57,399
These drawings have a significance.

1647
00:59:57,815 --> 01:00:00,007
Today is Christmas Special.

1648
01:00:00,085 --> 01:00:02,414
It's called Flirting Santa Claus Couple Race.

1649
01:00:02,415 --> 01:00:04,254
(Christmas Special: Flirting Santa Claus' Couple Race)

1650
01:00:04,255 --> 01:00:05,265
Oh, dear.

1651
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,102
- What do I do? - Flirting Santa Claus?

1652
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:08,254
Can we flirt?

1653
01:00:08,255 --> 01:00:09,366
(She's excited already.)

1654
01:00:09,384 --> 01:00:11,453
- You were a shirt with colors. - I know.

1655
01:00:11,454 --> 01:00:14,524
I've never seen him wear something with red and yellow in it.

1656
01:00:14,724 --> 01:00:17,593
- It's been a while. - I was going to wear gym clothes.

1657
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,828
- Behind the doors are... - Okay.

1658
01:00:21,634 --> 01:00:24,704
six male and female guests.

1659
01:00:25,974 --> 01:00:27,104
(His heart flutters.)

1660
01:00:27,105 --> 01:00:29,064
There will be seven couples in total.

1661
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:32,144
Unfortunately, there will be...

1662
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:33,901
- one male-male couple. - Oh, dear.

1663
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:36,732
(There will be a male-male couple on Christmas.)

1664
01:00:36,815 --> 01:00:40,187
You can see who's going to a male-male couple.

1665
01:00:40,454 --> 01:00:42,070
(Staring)

1666
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:43,911
See what?

1667
01:00:44,025 --> 01:00:46,223
- Why are you staring at me? - Male-male couple.

1668
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:47,993
Kwang Soo looks nice today.

1669
01:00:47,994 --> 01:00:49,712
The male-male couple...

1670
01:00:50,494 --> 01:00:52,133
It's Christmas.

1671
01:00:52,134 --> 01:00:56,403
The children who drew you portraits...

1672
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:59,133
also drew portraits of the guests.

1673
01:00:59,134 --> 01:01:00,286
(The children who drew them also drew the faces of the guests.)

1674
01:01:00,304 --> 01:01:01,557
Let's guess.

1675
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:04,807
Look at the pictures in front of the doors,

1676
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:06,544
and you can make an initial pick.

1677
01:01:06,545 --> 01:01:09,113
You can tell whether they're female or male from the pictures.

1678
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,113
Of course.

1679
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:11,528
- Should I open this? - Yes.

1680
01:01:11,784 --> 01:01:13,723
Children are good at picking out characteristics.

1681
01:01:13,724 --> 01:01:16,323
(How did the children view the first guest?)

1682
01:01:16,324 --> 01:01:17,794
- What's this? - It's a male.

1683
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:19,107
He's a singer.

1684
01:01:19,994 --> 01:01:21,712
He's holding a microphone.

1685
01:01:22,594 --> 01:01:23,676
I'm here.

1686
01:01:24,565 --> 01:01:25,676
I like singers.

1687
01:01:25,935 --> 01:01:27,403
- He's a male. - He is.

1688
01:01:27,404 --> 01:01:28,849
- He has short hair. - Okay.

1689
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,573
- He has brown hair. - I think he's a good singer.

1690
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:32,747
He must be.

1691
01:01:34,545 --> 01:01:35,644
(He opens the second picture.)

1692
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:36,755
What's this?

1693
01:01:37,344 --> 01:01:38,343
A squid?

1694
01:01:38,344 --> 01:01:40,743
(It's a male.)

1695
01:01:40,744 --> 01:01:42,664
- Abs. - It's a man.

1696
01:01:42,844 --> 01:01:44,066
- But... - I think it's a man.

1697
01:01:44,255 --> 01:01:45,932
Why is he naked?

1698
01:01:46,514 --> 01:01:48,584
- Why is he naked? - What?

1699
01:01:48,585 --> 01:01:50,341
- Why is he naked? - How many abs does he have?

1700
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:52,993
Jae Seok, it's a man. He has dark eyebrows.

1701
01:01:52,994 --> 01:01:54,194
- The mustache. - He has short hair too.

1702
01:01:54,195 --> 01:01:55,423
It's a man anyhow.

1703
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:56,878
(He moves on quickly.)

1704
01:01:57,594 --> 01:01:59,334
(The third guest is a woman.)

1705
01:01:59,335 --> 01:02:00,564
She's "The Little Mermaid".

1706
01:02:00,565 --> 01:02:02,403
(It's a female guest.)

1707
01:02:02,404 --> 01:02:03,617
It's a lady.

1708
01:02:05,474 --> 01:02:06,803
(It's a female.)

1709
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:08,359
- It's just a drawing... - She's pretty.

1710
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:11,138
She has distinctive features.

1711
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:12,414
This is detailed.

1712
01:02:12,415 --> 01:02:14,839
Does she have a bob cut?

1713
01:02:14,915 --> 01:02:16,314
She has shiny eyes.

1714
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:19,182
(Who's the third guest?)

1715
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:21,923
This is a woman as well.

1716
01:02:21,924 --> 01:02:23,713
Her hair is braided.

1717
01:02:23,755 --> 01:02:26,024
- She's cute. - She looks cute.

1718
01:02:26,025 --> 01:02:27,363
(It's a female.)

1719
01:02:27,364 --> 01:02:28,606
I think she's a singer.

1720
01:02:29,195 --> 01:02:30,593
Her hair is yellow.

1721
01:02:30,594 --> 01:02:32,553
I think she's an idol star.

1722
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:33,633
By the way,

1723
01:02:33,634 --> 01:02:36,290
there's only a small space for the hairline.

1724
01:02:36,534 --> 01:02:38,393
People who draw like this...

1725
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,934
are narrow-minded.

1726
01:02:39,935 --> 01:02:41,504
(The person who drew this must be narrow-minded!)

1727
01:02:41,505 --> 01:02:42,604
(Hold on...)

1728
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:44,332
- Really? - Yes, you can tell...

1729
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,940
Yes, you can tell from the drawing.

1730
01:02:47,215 --> 01:02:49,484
She didn't draw this herself. The children did.

1731
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:50,596
The seven-year-old?

1732
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:52,553
(Oh, right.)

1733
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:53,984
I'm sorry.

1734
01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:56,246
He's saying the children are narrow-minded.

1735
01:02:56,485 --> 01:02:58,273
- Are you saying that to children? - I'm sorry.

1736
01:02:58,454 --> 01:02:59,794
I'm sorry.

1737
01:02:59,795 --> 01:03:01,323
She didn't draw it herself.

1738
01:03:01,324 --> 01:03:03,124
(He can't take it back.)

1739
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:05,033
I thought the guests drew themselves.

1740
01:03:05,034 --> 01:03:06,863
- I'm sorry. - It was the children.

1741
01:03:06,864 --> 01:03:08,350
I'm sorry, children.

1742
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:09,803
I'm sorry.

1743
01:03:09,804 --> 01:03:10,903
You have a huge heart.

1744
01:03:10,904 --> 01:03:12,117
You are a generous child.

1745
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:14,144
I don't know for sure.

1746
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:15,874
(Who's the person who flustered Jae Seok?)

1747
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,086
You are a generous child.

1748
01:03:17,915 --> 01:03:19,228
That's nice.

1749
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:21,144
- It's a female. - That looks like Park Na Rae.

1750
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:23,165
- It's Park Na Rae. - It looks like her.

1751
01:03:23,485 --> 01:03:25,013
(It's a female.)

1752
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,165
It's Na Rae.

1753
01:03:26,185 --> 01:03:28,003
That looks like Hong Hyun Hee's nostrils.

1754
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:30,106
- The clothes. - That's Hyun Hee's nose.

1755
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,794
Jang Do Yeon?

1756
01:03:32,795 --> 01:03:34,279
- There's her too. - Jang Do Yeon.

1757
01:03:34,295 --> 01:03:35,493
She has long legs.

1758
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:38,524
No, it might be a man with long hair.

1759
01:03:38,795 --> 01:03:40,107
I think it's Na Rae.

1760
01:03:40,134 --> 01:03:41,263
I don't know who it is.

1761
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:42,346
Next.

1762
01:03:42,605 --> 01:03:44,203
(The last guest's portrait is revealed.)

1763
01:03:44,204 --> 01:03:45,648
- What's this? - It's Mona Lisa.

1764
01:03:45,735 --> 01:03:47,604
- She's pretty. - She looks pretty.

1765
01:03:47,605 --> 01:03:48,703
It's Shin Chan.

1766
01:03:48,704 --> 01:03:49,703
(It's a female.)

1767
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:50,774
She's wearing a red dress.

1768
01:03:50,775 --> 01:03:52,173
- Her eyes are too small. - I agree.

1769
01:03:52,174 --> 01:03:54,743
- I think she's an actress. - This is artistic.

1770
01:03:54,744 --> 01:03:57,484
- I want to buy this painting. - They're good.

1771
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:58,653
This one's good.

1772
01:03:58,654 --> 01:03:59,914
- That one is good. - It's really good.

1773
01:03:59,915 --> 01:04:01,570
Are there two guys then?

1774
01:04:01,685 --> 01:04:04,220
- That's what it looks like. - I have no clue.

1775
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:05,836
Yes.

1776
01:04:05,954 --> 01:04:08,147
(Shall we flirt today?)

1777
01:04:08,165 --> 01:04:10,024
- Do we stand in front of a door? - Do we?

1778
01:04:10,025 --> 01:04:13,368
Each of you can stand in front of a door of your choice.

1779
01:04:14,005 --> 01:04:16,327
If there's more than one person by a door,

1780
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:18,555
the guest will pick their partner.

1781
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:20,033
I don't want to fight.

1782
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:21,504
The member who gets rejected...

1783
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:24,070
- has to move to the Anxious Bench. - "Anxious Bench"?

1784
01:04:24,145 --> 01:04:26,236
- Is there such a thing? - Do we have to do that?

1785
01:04:26,514 --> 01:04:27,697
Yes, and...

1786
01:04:27,784 --> 01:04:30,453
if there's nobody in front of a door...

1787
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,783
or if the guest doesn't like anybody,

1788
01:04:32,784 --> 01:04:34,339
they can move to the Single's Bench.

1789
01:04:34,824 --> 01:04:35,953
- That's better. - Oh, dear.

1790
01:04:35,954 --> 01:04:39,453
Then please stand in front of a door.

1791
01:04:39,454 --> 01:04:40,677
All right.

1792
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:44,763
You have to target a niche market. An empty spot.

1793
01:04:44,764 --> 01:04:46,564
This is Na Rae.

1794
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:48,104
- I know. - It's Na Rae.

1795
01:04:48,105 --> 01:04:49,334
Okay, I'll stand here.

1796
01:04:49,335 --> 01:04:50,533
- I think it's Na Rae. - It is.

1797
01:04:50,534 --> 01:04:52,403
I don't think it is.

1798
01:04:52,404 --> 01:04:54,144
If this is Na Rae, the child did a good job.

1799
01:04:54,145 --> 01:04:55,703
It has to be Na Rae.

1800
01:04:55,704 --> 01:04:56,786
It's totally her.

1801
01:04:56,844 --> 01:04:58,544
Her eyes are too large.

1802
01:04:58,545 --> 01:04:59,874
Oh, dear.

1803
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,612
I kind of like the short hair.

1804
01:05:02,685 --> 01:05:04,128
- Do you like it? - Is that short hair?

1805
01:05:04,384 --> 01:05:06,071
That's really short.

1806
01:05:06,415 --> 01:05:07,783
I think it's really Na Rae.

1807
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:10,323
(Jong Kook doesn't pick.)

1808
01:05:10,324 --> 01:05:13,093
(He just watches.)

1809
01:05:13,094 --> 01:05:14,524
Okay, I'll stand here.

1810
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:16,024
(Who does he want to pick?)

1811
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:17,033
- This is strange, - She's cute.

1812
01:05:17,034 --> 01:05:18,763
but I'm considering the competitors.

1813
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:21,390
(It's a game of wits.)

1814
01:05:22,204 --> 01:05:24,374
- Hey. - He's observing.

1815
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:26,973
I'm considering who my competitors are.

1816
01:05:26,974 --> 01:05:28,573
Come.

1817
01:05:28,574 --> 01:05:30,104
That's why...

1818
01:05:30,105 --> 01:05:31,589
I'm behind Se Chan.

1819
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,187
Is that why you came to me?

1820
01:05:33,375 --> 01:05:34,496
Jae Seok.

1821
01:05:34,614 --> 01:05:36,806
Why? Why?

1822
01:05:37,215 --> 01:05:39,513
You have to see who you're up against.

1823
01:05:39,514 --> 01:05:40,723
(Flirting Santa Claus' Couple Race is competitive from the beginning.)

1824
01:05:40,724 --> 01:05:43,310
If I stand here, I'll end up in a male-male couple.

1825
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:45,354
You never know.

1826
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,213
I think you'll lose wherever you go.

1827
01:05:47,525 --> 01:05:48,694
- Come. - This is driving me nuts.

1828
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:49,794
(Should I pick Jong Kook or Seok Jin?)

1829
01:05:49,795 --> 01:05:51,064
I'm the only one. What if I get rejected?

1830
01:05:51,065 --> 01:05:52,334
Who did you pick?

1831
01:05:52,335 --> 01:05:54,033
- We both went for number one. - Yes.

1832
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,317
Both of you?

1833
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:58,403
Then the second guest...

1834
01:05:58,435 --> 01:06:00,604
- has nobody. - There's nobody.

1835
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:02,321
The drawing looks scary.

1836
01:06:02,474 --> 01:06:04,874
All right. Let's reveal the first guest.

1837
01:06:04,875 --> 01:06:06,763
(Partner Selection)

1838
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:10,044
First guest, come on out.

1839
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:11,513
We didn't have any male guest in a long time.

1840
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:13,383
(Who is it?)

1841
01:06:13,384 --> 01:06:14,723
He's holding a microphone.

1842
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:18,653
(Everybody thought he was a singer.)

1843
01:06:18,654 --> 01:06:19,806
It's Chi Yeul.

1844
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:23,427
(Cheers in your heart! Hwang Chi Yeul)

1845
01:06:23,795 --> 01:06:26,334
(He's a great singer and a dancer.)

1846
01:06:26,335 --> 01:06:30,102
(Even when you're tired, he cheers you up.)

1847
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:31,919
Chi Yeul.

1848
01:06:32,605 --> 01:06:34,044
- That's why he was holding a mic. - Hello.

1849
01:06:34,045 --> 01:06:35,303
- Hello. - Chi Yeul.

1850
01:06:35,304 --> 01:06:37,743
(They cheer up just by looking at him.)

1851
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,073
Merry Christmas.

1852
01:06:39,074 --> 01:06:40,287
It's been a long time.

1853
01:06:40,415 --> 01:06:42,484
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1854
01:06:42,485 --> 01:06:43,584
Chi Yeul.

1855
01:06:43,585 --> 01:06:45,473
Let me ask you.

1856
01:06:45,514 --> 01:06:47,141
Why did you both stand here?

1857
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:49,153
That drawing looks strange.

1858
01:06:49,154 --> 01:06:51,754
He's naked, and he's wearing stockings.

1859
01:06:51,755 --> 01:06:53,411
(That's very strange.)

1860
01:06:54,965 --> 01:06:56,223
I see.

1861
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:57,750
He's really hairy too.

1862
01:06:58,465 --> 01:07:01,029
Chi Yeul, do you think that looks like him?

1863
01:07:01,065 --> 01:07:03,503
- I understand what this means. - Really?

1864
01:07:03,504 --> 01:07:04,574
How do you think it is?

1865
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,493
- Are there his characteristics? - Yes.

1866
01:07:06,804 --> 01:07:08,043
All right.

1867
01:07:08,044 --> 01:07:10,913
You have to pick one person to be your partner.

1868
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:13,614
- You were Ji Hyo's partner once. - Right.

1869
01:07:13,615 --> 01:07:14,883
- Right. - He was her partner.

1870
01:07:14,884 --> 01:07:15,944
Chi Yeul.

1871
01:07:15,945 --> 01:07:19,454
(Chi Yeul, do you remember? We had a good time.)

1872
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:20,697
Ji Hyo.

1873
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:24,593
Chi Yeul, let's do it again.

1874
01:07:24,594 --> 01:07:25,806
(Let's be partners again.)

1875
01:07:25,895 --> 01:07:26,894
I like you.

1876
01:07:26,895 --> 01:07:28,177
Stop lying.

1877
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:32,534
(She makes a false confession to be a couple.)

1878
01:07:32,535 --> 01:07:34,180
Stop lying.

1879
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:37,453
We haven't done this in a while.

1880
01:07:37,705 --> 01:07:39,089
Make an acrostic poem with his name.

1881
01:07:39,174 --> 01:07:40,204
That's so hard.

1882
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:41,473
Sure. I think it's a good idea.

1883
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,774
So Min.

1884
01:07:42,775 --> 01:07:44,290
(This will be a decisive factor for the partner selection.)

1885
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:46,191
The first line.

1886
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:47,543
Hwang Chi Yeul.

1887
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:48,583
- "Hwang Chi Yeul"? - "Hwang Chi Yeul".

1888
01:07:48,584 --> 01:07:50,284
- The second line. - Don't be cheap.

1889
01:07:50,285 --> 01:07:51,553
- "Don't be cheap". The last line. - That's good.

1890
01:07:51,554 --> 01:07:52,868
I'll try my best.

1891
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:56,481
(She'll burn it up.)

1892
01:07:57,224 --> 01:07:58,593
(He loves it.)

1893
01:07:58,594 --> 01:08:00,564
She'll try her best.

1894
01:08:00,565 --> 01:08:02,824
(He likes her more after the acrostic poem.)

1895
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:04,916
(She tried her best. They approve.)

1896
01:08:05,464 --> 01:08:08,034
Good job.

1897
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:09,550
Chi Yeul,

1898
01:08:09,735 --> 01:08:12,027
please pick one person.

1899
01:08:12,105 --> 01:08:14,843
Call their name first and decide if you want to be their partner...

1900
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:16,543
or reject them. Please choose one.

1901
01:08:16,544 --> 01:08:17,913
- That's cruel. - In 1, 2, 3.

1902
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:21,083
(Who will Chi Yeul pick?)

1903
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:22,484
- Ji Hyo. - He called out Ji Hyo.

1904
01:08:22,485 --> 01:08:23,524
(He calls Ji Hyo first after hesitating.)

1905
01:08:24,054 --> 01:08:25,297
Ji Hyo, please come forward.

1906
01:08:25,455 --> 01:08:27,883
Ji Hyo? Is she your partner or are you rejecting her?

1907
01:08:27,884 --> 01:08:29,268
In 1, 2, 3.

1908
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:30,735
Ji Hyo.

1909
01:08:30,924 --> 01:08:35,564
(Does he have good memories of Ji Hyo?)

1910
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:39,403
(Or did he find So Min appealing?)

1911
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:41,503
- 2, 3. - Ji Hyo.

1912
01:08:41,504 --> 01:08:43,934
(Ji Hyo!)

1913
01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:45,373
Merry Christmas. I'm sorry.

1914
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:46,973
(I'm sorry.)

1915
01:08:46,974 --> 01:08:48,373
Merry Christmas. I'm sorry.

1916
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:50,373
(He picks So Min instead of his old partner.)

1917
01:08:50,374 --> 01:08:51,727
So Min.

1918
01:08:52,014 --> 01:08:53,964
- So Min. - All right. I see.

1919
01:08:53,985 --> 01:08:56,470
- No, we were partners last time. - Fine.

1920
01:08:56,844 --> 01:08:58,703
- So Min and Chi Yeul. - He rejected her.

1921
01:08:59,214 --> 01:09:01,446
He made it sound sad.

1922
01:09:01,624 --> 01:09:04,994
- Ji Hyo, go to the Anxious Bench. - Oh, gosh.

1923
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:06,654
Next. Number three.

1924
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:07,907
- Us. - Okay.

1925
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,144
Jong Kook and Seok Jin, come here.

1926
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:11,793
Third guest?

1927
01:09:11,794 --> 01:09:13,064
I'm really curious.

1928
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:15,463
(You can already see the result.)

1929
01:09:15,464 --> 01:09:18,074
(Their partner looks pretty in the drawing.)

1930
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:20,095
(She has distinctive features. Who is this person?)

1931
01:09:21,205 --> 01:09:22,373
Oh, dear. Hye Bin.

1932
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:23,929
(The variety show legend, Jeon Hye Bin)

1933
01:09:24,214 --> 01:09:29,913
(She's a singer, entertainer, and an actress. She can do it all.)

1934
01:09:29,914 --> 01:09:32,454
(She dominated variety shows in the early 21st century...)

1935
01:09:32,455 --> 01:09:35,110
(by spinning endlessly.)

1936
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,747
- It's Hye Bin. - Right.

1937
01:09:37,754 --> 01:09:38,854
- It has been a while. - Hello.

1938
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:40,340
- My goodness. - It has been a while.

1939
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:42,524
It has been a while.

1940
01:09:42,525 --> 01:09:44,663
- 24-Hour Spinner. - That's right.

1941
01:09:44,664 --> 01:09:46,856
- She spins for 24 hours. - That's right.

1942
01:09:47,164 --> 01:09:49,022
That was ages ago.

1943
01:09:49,565 --> 01:09:50,934
Stop it.

1944
01:09:50,935 --> 01:09:53,074
- 24-Hour Spinner. - 24-Hour Spinner.

1945
01:09:53,075 --> 01:09:54,604
- She was on "Match Made in Heaven". - 24-Hour Spinner.

1946
01:09:54,605 --> 01:09:56,018
It was the 2000s.

1947
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:58,314
We have an actress,

1948
01:09:58,315 --> 01:09:59,543
Jeon Hye Bin!

1949
01:09:59,544 --> 01:10:01,843
(The second guest is an actress, Jeon Hye Bin.)

1950
01:10:01,844 --> 01:10:05,184
Your outfit matches that of Jong Kook.

1951
01:10:05,185 --> 01:10:07,154
- Did they choose me? - Yes.

1952
01:10:07,155 --> 01:10:08,468
They chose you.

1953
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:10,184
It has been a while, right?

1954
01:10:10,185 --> 01:10:12,053
- It has been a while. - Seriously.

1955
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:14,163
(Seok Jin becomes quiet.)

1956
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:16,013
- She was on "Love Letter". - Was she on "Love Letter"?

1957
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:18,894
You haven't been on a variety show since "Match Made in Heaven".

1958
01:10:18,895 --> 01:10:21,056
- She was on "Love Letter". - Was she on "Love Letter"?

1959
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:23,303
Seok Jin, say something.

1960
01:10:23,304 --> 01:10:25,303
(He looks pitiful.)

1961
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:26,604
- What? - It occurred to Seok Jin.

1962
01:10:26,605 --> 01:10:28,866
I am happy to see Hye Bin.

1963
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,631
It occurred to Seok Jin.

1964
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:31,944
"She won't choose me."

1965
01:10:31,945 --> 01:10:33,127
(That's why he was quiet.)

1966
01:10:33,844 --> 01:10:34,854
What?

1967
01:10:35,245 --> 01:10:37,883
You only looked at Jong Kook as you asked, "Did they choose me?"

1968
01:10:37,884 --> 01:10:39,654
- Seok Jin. - You didn't even look at Seok Jin.

1969
01:10:39,655 --> 01:10:41,068
I didn't do that.

1970
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:43,383
He realized he won't get chosen.

1971
01:10:43,384 --> 01:10:44,423
- He knows. - He realized that.

1972
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:45,465
You never know.

1973
01:10:45,754 --> 01:10:46,824
It's not like that.

1974
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,324
Let's see what they can do.

1975
01:10:48,325 --> 01:10:49,364
- Do you want to see that? - Yes.

1976
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:50,994
Let's see what they can do.

1977
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:53,364
I want to give Seok Jin a chance.

1978
01:10:53,365 --> 01:10:55,064
(I want to give Seok Jin a chance.)

1979
01:10:55,065 --> 01:10:56,934
(She is the nicest person.)

1980
01:10:56,935 --> 01:10:58,248
Seok Jin, show your strength.

1981
01:10:58,804 --> 01:11:01,744
She is really nice. She is a saint.

1982
01:11:01,745 --> 01:11:02,744
In that case,

1983
01:11:02,745 --> 01:11:04,074
(Hye Bin gives him a chance.)

1984
01:11:04,075 --> 01:11:05,444
I will show my power.

1985
01:11:05,445 --> 01:11:06,444
(He decides to show his power.)

1986
01:11:06,445 --> 01:11:08,244
(He is ready to show the power of a middle-aged man.)

1987
01:11:08,245 --> 01:11:10,513
- Power? - Against Jong Kook?

1988
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:12,454
Seok Jin will show his power.

1989
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:13,513
(Seok Jin challenges Jong Kook, the embodiment of power.)

1990
01:11:13,514 --> 01:11:16,454
Jong Kook, why don't you show us your power?

1991
01:11:16,455 --> 01:11:18,093
- Power? - Yes, show us your power.

1992
01:11:18,094 --> 01:11:20,447
- What do you want me to do? - Why don't you do push-ups...

1993
01:11:20,525 --> 01:11:21,978
with me on your back?

1994
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,163
- Superpower. - Show us your superpower.

1995
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:25,534
You are heavy.

1996
01:11:25,535 --> 01:11:26,663
- Come on. - Men are heavy.

1997
01:11:26,664 --> 01:11:27,963
Men are heavy.

1998
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:29,303
Give it a try.

1999
01:11:29,304 --> 01:11:31,557
- He only weighs 63kg. - That's right.

2000
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:33,473
He will be able to do it.

2001
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:34,616
(Hye Bin is expectant.)

2002
01:11:34,905 --> 01:11:36,404
Sit on my shoulders.

2003
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:37,485
Okay.

2004
01:11:37,575 --> 01:11:39,513
I guess Jong Kook wants to look cool.

2005
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:40,684
(His initial hesitation is gone.)

2006
01:11:40,685 --> 01:11:43,114
(Men are like that.)

2007
01:11:43,115 --> 01:11:44,599
He even told Jae Seok where to sit,

2008
01:11:45,185 --> 01:11:46,713
so that he doesn't fail.

2009
01:11:46,714 --> 01:11:48,053
(Jong Kook shows his will to succeed.)

2010
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,784
- Okay. - It's a difficult task.

2011
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:50,793
Is this okay?

2012
01:11:50,794 --> 01:11:52,007
It's a difficult task.

2013
01:11:53,424 --> 01:11:54,663
My goodness.

2014
01:11:54,664 --> 01:11:57,320
(After trembling for a while, he does perfect push-ups.)

2015
01:11:58,035 --> 01:12:00,560
(This is Jong Kook's power.)

2016
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:04,230
(Jong Kook is amazing.)

2017
01:12:04,504 --> 01:12:06,404
(My goodness.)

2018
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,473
My goodness.

2019
01:12:07,474 --> 01:12:09,929
(He gives it his all.)

2020
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:12,253
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E431 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

2021
01:12:12,315 --> 01:12:13,425
He doesn't disappoint.

2022
01:12:13,974 --> 01:12:15,013
He is incredible.

2023
01:12:15,014 --> 01:12:16,095
Hye Bin, sit on me.

2024
01:12:17,014 --> 01:12:19,583
(It's Seok Jin's turn to show his power.)

2025
01:12:19,584 --> 01:12:20,954
All right. I will sit on you.

2026
01:12:20,955 --> 01:12:22,854
(Seok Jin goes against Jong Kook,)

2027
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:25,581
(who did push-ups with Jae Seok on his back.)

2028
01:12:25,754 --> 01:12:29,734
(Will Seok Jin succeed to show his charms?)

2029
01:12:31,195 --> 01:12:32,882
(It's not a surprise.)

2030
01:12:33,664 --> 01:12:35,564
(He lies flat on the ground.)

2031
01:12:35,565 --> 01:12:36,716
He failed.

2032
01:12:36,865 --> 01:12:38,673
(Seok Jin completely fails to show his power.)

2033
01:12:38,674 --> 01:12:41,673
- My goodness. - Still, he did his best.

2034
01:12:41,674 --> 01:12:43,074
- What a shame! - Hye Bin said,

2035
01:12:43,075 --> 01:12:44,528
"Still, he did his best."

2036
01:12:45,344 --> 01:12:47,043
Why don't you give us an acrostic poem?

2037
01:12:47,044 --> 01:12:48,257
- An acrostic poem? - Yes.

2038
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:49,984
(Okay, I will give it a go.)

2039
01:12:49,985 --> 01:12:51,065
The first line.

2040
01:12:52,115 --> 01:12:53,713
I have known you for a while,

2041
01:12:53,714 --> 01:12:55,239
but you changed.

2042
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:57,284
- My goodness. - The second line.

2043
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:58,293
(The second line.)

2044
01:12:58,294 --> 01:13:00,253
Hye Bin, it finally happened.

2045
01:13:00,254 --> 01:13:03,963
(Hye Bin, it finally happened.)

2046
01:13:03,964 --> 01:13:05,564
- The third line. - You lost your shabbiness.

2047
01:13:05,565 --> 01:13:07,463
(You lost your shabbiness.)

2048
01:13:07,464 --> 01:13:10,666
(Is that a compliment or a criticism?)

2049
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:12,873
What was that?

2050
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:14,404
Is he picking a fight?

2051
01:13:14,405 --> 01:13:16,144
Why did you criticize her?

2052
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:17,303
- What was that? - It's okay.

2053
01:13:17,304 --> 01:13:18,991
It's okay. I mean...

2054
01:13:19,214 --> 01:13:21,543
He is picking a fight.

2055
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:22,857
Seriously.

2056
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:24,903
- He knows he won't get picked, - It just happened that way.

2057
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,553
so he is picking a fight with an acrostic poem.

2058
01:13:26,554 --> 01:13:29,083
- Please choose right away. - Should I choose here?

2059
01:13:29,084 --> 01:13:31,123
Yes. It would be better to do it right away.

2060
01:13:31,124 --> 01:13:32,694
In 1, 2, 3.

2061
01:13:32,695 --> 01:13:34,815
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin, step forward.

2062
01:13:34,895 --> 01:13:36,163
Seok Jin is smiling.

2063
01:13:36,164 --> 01:13:37,864
(I can see it.)

2064
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:40,864
(I can see myself at Anxious Bench.)

2065
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:43,003
Say either "I am sorry" or "Get lost."

2066
01:13:43,004 --> 01:13:44,333
No, I chose him as my partner.

2067
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:45,618
- Really? - Really?

2068
01:13:45,935 --> 01:13:48,444
(Does she want to partner up with Seok Jin?)

2069
01:13:48,445 --> 01:13:49,574
- Really? - Really?

2070
01:13:49,575 --> 01:13:54,343
(Why does she want to do that with the weakest member?)

2071
01:13:54,344 --> 01:13:55,413
Congratulations.

2072
01:13:55,414 --> 01:13:56,513
(I am happy, but...)

2073
01:13:56,514 --> 01:13:59,154
- Really? - In December,

2074
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:01,083
(What about December?)

2075
01:14:01,084 --> 01:14:04,694
- you should help those in need. - Hey.

2076
01:14:04,695 --> 01:14:06,293
Be quiet.

2077
01:14:06,294 --> 01:14:08,284
- Is this a charity? - No, no.

2078
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:10,293
- It's a charity! - Are you serious?

2079
01:14:10,294 --> 01:14:11,344
(Then it makes sense.)

2080
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:13,994
Seok Jin seemed...

2081
01:14:13,995 --> 01:14:16,604
lonely at heart.

2082
01:14:16,605 --> 01:14:18,303
(The one who is chosen and the one who is left behind)

2083
01:14:18,304 --> 01:14:20,373
This makes Jong Kook look weird.

2084
01:14:20,374 --> 01:14:21,973
- No way. - Jong Kook.

2085
01:14:21,974 --> 01:14:23,043
Okay.

2086
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:24,614
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2087
01:14:24,615 --> 01:14:26,944
- She is so nice. - Seriously.

2088
01:14:26,945 --> 01:14:28,043
She is a saint.

2089
01:14:28,044 --> 01:14:29,413
A saint?

2090
01:14:29,414 --> 01:14:31,583
You helped the one in need.

2091
01:14:31,584 --> 01:14:32,725
This is a disaster.

2092
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:35,284
This time, number six will be revealed.

2093
01:14:35,285 --> 01:14:36,583
- Number six. - All right.

2094
01:14:36,584 --> 01:14:38,342
- It's neck-and-neck. - The competition is fierce.

2095
01:14:39,424 --> 01:14:41,263
- All right. - I am curious about number six.

2096
01:14:41,264 --> 01:14:43,112
- Who could number six be? - I am really curious.

2097
01:14:43,365 --> 01:14:44,593
Number six, come on out.

2098
01:14:44,594 --> 01:14:45,934
(Kwang Soo and Se Chan's pick)

2099
01:14:45,935 --> 01:14:48,156
(She seems to be an actress in a red dress.)

2100
01:14:48,905 --> 01:14:51,632
(Who is this?)

2101
01:14:52,205 --> 01:14:53,434
Seon Hwa!

2102
01:14:53,435 --> 01:14:54,758
It has been a while.

2103
01:14:55,605 --> 01:14:59,314
(She commanded the music industry and made a comeback as an actress.)

2104
01:14:59,315 --> 01:15:02,184
(The talented actress visits Running Man for the first time.)

2105
01:15:02,185 --> 01:15:03,184
It's Seon Hwa.

2106
01:15:03,185 --> 01:15:04,383
- It has been a while. - Seon Hwa.

2107
01:15:04,384 --> 01:15:06,909
- It has been a while. - Seon Hwa, it has been a while.

2108
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:08,297
Seon Hwa.

2109
01:15:08,525 --> 01:15:11,383
- Seon Hwa, it has been a while. - Hello.

2110
01:15:11,554 --> 01:15:13,553
(We are the candidates.)

2111
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:14,694
- Hello. - Have you been well?

2112
01:15:14,695 --> 01:15:16,694
- Are the two of you a couple? - This is incredible.

2113
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:18,364
My goodness.

2114
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:19,434
(Gosh, we are a couple.)

2115
01:15:19,435 --> 01:15:21,151
What are you doing?

2116
01:15:21,504 --> 01:15:22,564
I am happy to see her.

2117
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:24,934
Seon Hwa, in front of you...

2118
01:15:24,935 --> 01:15:27,204
are Se Chan and Kwang Soo.

2119
01:15:27,205 --> 01:15:29,303
Is there anything you want to ask of them?

2120
01:15:29,304 --> 01:15:31,173
- The thing is, - Do you have a question?

2121
01:15:31,174 --> 01:15:32,673
I am fascinated.

2122
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:35,542
When I had the preliminary interview,

2123
01:15:35,714 --> 01:15:37,954
I picked the person I want the most...

2124
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,784
and the person I want the least.

2125
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:42,553
- You told the writers. - That's right.

2126
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:46,024
Both of them are here.

2127
01:15:46,025 --> 01:15:47,524
(One is the 1st place while the other is the last place.)

2128
01:15:47,525 --> 01:15:50,524
The person you want the most and the person you want the least.

2129
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:51,694
(One of them will go to Anxious Bench.)

2130
01:15:51,695 --> 01:15:53,008
The last place.

2131
01:15:53,735 --> 01:15:56,027
I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.

2132
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:59,605
The person who doesn't get picked is the sixth place in your heart.

2133
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:02,803
The two of you should do something.

2134
01:16:02,804 --> 01:16:04,188
Why don't you make an acrostic poem?

2135
01:16:04,315 --> 01:16:05,973
I am curious about what you will come up with.

2136
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:08,043
Let's start with Kwang Soo.

2137
01:16:08,044 --> 01:16:09,083
The first line.

2138
01:16:09,084 --> 01:16:11,114
(The first line.)

2139
01:16:11,115 --> 01:16:12,784
Time's up.

2140
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:13,854
(Jae Seok moves on.)

2141
01:16:13,855 --> 01:16:15,623
(He is a strict MC.)

2142
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:16,684
Time's up.

2143
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:19,454
Since there are other guests, you can't take too long.

2144
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:21,263
- Yes. You shouldn't take too long. - All right.

2145
01:16:21,264 --> 01:16:22,364
Make an acrostic poem.

2146
01:16:22,365 --> 01:16:24,793
You did a good job when Irene was here.

2147
01:16:24,794 --> 01:16:26,534
(This is how Se Chan did before.)

2148
01:16:26,535 --> 01:16:28,463
(The first line: What a picture!)

2149
01:16:28,464 --> 01:16:29,704
(The second line)

2150
01:16:29,705 --> 01:16:31,833
(Irene, I will make sure you sleep someplace warm.)

2151
01:16:31,834 --> 01:16:34,803
(The third line: Rinnai)

2152
01:16:34,804 --> 01:16:37,104
(How will the rookie of acrostic poem do today?)

2153
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:39,195
- I will give it a go. - All right.

2154
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:41,284
Make an acrostic poem. The first line.

2155
01:16:41,285 --> 01:16:43,114
Seon Hwa, may I like you?

2156
01:16:43,115 --> 01:16:44,784
(Seon Hwa, may I like you?)

2157
01:16:44,785 --> 01:16:46,213
(He is manly.)

2158
01:16:46,214 --> 01:16:47,769
The second line.

2159
01:16:48,185 --> 01:16:49,484
Seon Hwa, your face...

2160
01:16:49,485 --> 01:16:51,553
(Seon Hwa, your face...)

2161
01:16:51,554 --> 01:16:54,150
(Is this a confession of love?)

2162
01:16:54,424 --> 01:16:56,394
(Seon Hwa, your face...)

2163
01:16:56,395 --> 01:16:58,263
- The third line. - Looks nice with makeup.

2164
01:16:58,264 --> 01:16:59,833
(Looks nice with makeup)

2165
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:02,259
(He suddenly talks about her makeup.)

2166
01:17:02,464 --> 01:17:04,704
(I have a chance.)

2167
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:06,734
- Do you think you have a chance? - Yes.

2168
01:17:06,735 --> 01:17:08,274
- "I can beat this." - Yes.

2169
01:17:08,275 --> 01:17:10,104
- "I can beat this." - I got you started.

2170
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:12,673
Kwang Soo is thinking, "I have a chance."

2171
01:17:12,674 --> 01:17:14,058
The first line.

2172
01:17:15,145 --> 01:17:16,444
I thought about this for a while.

2173
01:17:16,445 --> 01:17:18,713
(I thought about this for a while.)

2174
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:20,954
(It's not bad.)

2175
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:22,237
The second line.

2176
01:17:23,624 --> 01:17:25,223
- Seon Hwa. - Yes?

2177
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:28,024
(Seon Hwa.)

2178
01:17:28,025 --> 01:17:30,663
(I thought about this for a while. Seon Hwa.)

2179
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:31,846
The third line.

2180
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,263
I need to use the restroom.

2181
01:17:34,264 --> 01:17:35,864
(I need to use the restroom.)

2182
01:17:35,865 --> 01:17:38,228
(He suddenly comes clean about his physiological phenomenon.)

2183
01:17:38,834 --> 01:17:39,833
What was that?

2184
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:41,561
- I am sorry. - You did a good job.

2185
01:17:41,674 --> 01:17:44,303
- Seon Hwa laughed. - Yes.

2186
01:17:44,304 --> 01:17:46,698
It's time to make a decision.

2187
01:17:47,174 --> 01:17:48,713
She could push the person she doesn't want.

2188
01:17:48,714 --> 01:17:50,184
- Really? - It would really hurt.

2189
01:17:50,185 --> 01:17:52,614
- Really? - Push the person you don't want.

2190
01:17:52,615 --> 01:17:54,684
- I... - The person you don't want.

2191
01:17:54,685 --> 01:17:56,753
The person who will go to Anxious Bench.

2192
01:17:56,754 --> 01:17:58,674
It's already packed here.

2193
01:17:59,525 --> 01:18:01,694
- In 1, 2, 3. - I have a chance.

2194
01:18:01,695 --> 01:18:03,210
(Seon Hwa stands in the middle.)

2195
01:18:03,624 --> 01:18:09,422
(In her heart, one is the 1st place while the other is the last place.)

2196
01:18:09,535 --> 01:18:11,803
(Who is the last place in her heart?)

2197
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:14,359
(Pushing)

2198
01:18:14,705 --> 01:18:15,944
(I have a chance.)

2199
01:18:15,945 --> 01:18:16,973
(Go to Anxious Bench.)

2200
01:18:16,974 --> 01:18:18,863
She pushed him when he said, "I have a chance."

2201
01:18:19,174 --> 01:18:21,043
Stand next to Jong Kook.

2202
01:18:21,044 --> 01:18:22,054
I feel bad.

2203
01:18:22,214 --> 01:18:24,639
Se Chan.

2204
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:28,515
Seon Hwa and Kwang Soo will go to Couple's Bench.

2205
01:18:29,124 --> 01:18:31,044
- Okay. - Haha.

2206
01:18:32,094 --> 01:18:33,771
Haha, you picked number four.

2207
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:35,305
Number four,

2208
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:36,994
please come on out.

2209
01:18:36,995 --> 01:18:41,782
(Did he pick a blonde idol singer?)

2210
01:18:41,935 --> 01:18:45,704
(Is this person really an idol singer?)

2211
01:18:45,705 --> 01:18:46,734
My goodness.

2212
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:48,795
- Hello. - Ha Na.

2213
01:18:49,575 --> 01:18:53,513
(Park Ha Na specializes in playing antagonists.)

2214
01:18:53,674 --> 01:18:57,413
(She is back on Running Man after 3 years.)

2215
01:18:57,414 --> 01:18:58,913
My goodness. Hello.

2216
01:18:58,914 --> 01:19:01,782
- Ha Na. - Please come this way.

2217
01:19:02,624 --> 01:19:04,623
- It has been a while. - Yes.

2218
01:19:04,624 --> 01:19:07,053
Park Ha Na.

2219
01:19:07,054 --> 01:19:08,763
She visited the show after a long break.

2220
01:19:08,764 --> 01:19:09,864
(They are happy to see her.)

2221
01:19:09,865 --> 01:19:11,333
I should have gone there.

2222
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:13,364
- I should have gone there. - I should have gone there.

2223
01:19:13,365 --> 01:19:14,617
I thought there would be an idol singer.

2224
01:19:14,804 --> 01:19:16,963
- She might not want me. - If you don't want him,

2225
01:19:16,964 --> 01:19:18,450
you could pass over him.

2226
01:19:18,735 --> 01:19:21,404
Ha Na, what is your choice? In 1, 2, 3.

2227
01:19:21,405 --> 01:19:22,543
Come on.

2228
01:19:22,544 --> 01:19:23,774
- Ha Na. - I am sorry.

2229
01:19:23,775 --> 01:19:25,865
(I don't want to be your partner.)

2230
01:19:26,315 --> 01:19:27,343
- Ha Na. - I am sorry.

2231
01:19:27,344 --> 01:19:29,909
(She refuses to be his partner.)

2232
01:19:30,044 --> 01:19:32,154
- He must be embarrassed. - My goodness.

2233
01:19:32,155 --> 01:19:33,670
- This is good. - Okay.

2234
01:19:34,554 --> 01:19:36,848
(She runs to Single's Bench to avoid Haha.)

2235
01:19:37,054 --> 01:19:39,394
She's rather be alone than teaming up with Haha.

2236
01:19:39,395 --> 01:19:41,163
- You come here. Join us. - My gosh.

2237
01:19:41,164 --> 01:19:43,084
She's very gutsy.

2238
01:19:44,025 --> 01:19:46,015
(Haha goes to the Anxious Bench and Ha Na, to the Single's Bench.)

2239
01:19:46,094 --> 01:19:48,003
Next up is the fifth partner.

2240
01:19:48,004 --> 01:19:49,303
(Jae Seok was the only one who chose the 5th partner.)

2241
01:19:49,304 --> 01:19:51,395
- Come on out, Na Rae. - It's Na Rae.

2242
01:19:51,504 --> 01:19:53,104
- Na Rae, come on out. - Na Rae.

2243
01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:54,660
Na Rae.

2244
01:19:55,205 --> 01:19:57,527
Na Rae, come on!

2245
01:19:58,344 --> 01:20:03,839
(Will this painting be Na Rae's just like everyone expected?)

2246
01:20:03,945 --> 01:20:06,439
- How on earth does it look? - Hey!

2247
01:20:07,514 --> 01:20:08,938
- Oh, no. - Hey, is it you, Soo Young?

2248
01:20:09,155 --> 01:20:10,284
- I'm sorry. - My gosh.

2249
01:20:10,285 --> 01:20:12,376
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

2250
01:20:12,895 --> 01:20:13,923
My apologies.

2251
01:20:13,924 --> 01:20:15,410
(Soo Young from Girls' Generation, Na Rae's lookalike)

2252
01:20:16,065 --> 01:20:19,263
(She made the complete transition from the idol singer to an actress.)

2253
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:22,734
(She's an elite of TV shows who can sing, act, and entertain.)

2254
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,976
Hey, Soo Young.

2255
01:20:24,705 --> 01:20:26,189
- How does the drawing look? - Soo Young.

2256
01:20:26,634 --> 01:20:29,231
- I thought it was Na Rae. - I'm sorry.

2257
01:20:29,745 --> 01:20:32,300
- That's a great drawing. - I didn't know that.

2258
01:20:32,514 --> 01:20:34,744
- But the drawing resembles you. - It does slightly.

2259
01:20:34,745 --> 01:20:36,883
- You do look like the drawing. - Do you see the resemblance?

2260
01:20:36,884 --> 01:20:39,309
- I do see the resemblance. - That's a great drawing.

2261
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:41,805
As you can see,

2262
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:45,692
Ha Na went to the Single's Bench even if Haha chose her.

2263
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,923
- Even though you can choose me, - Okay.

2264
01:20:48,924 --> 01:20:50,994
you can also go to the Single's Bench.

2265
01:20:50,995 --> 01:20:52,812
Or you and I can go to the Couple's Bench together.

2266
01:20:53,094 --> 01:20:55,604
All right. Make your decision, Soo Young.

2267
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:57,934
- Show us. - Actually, she and I...

2268
01:20:57,935 --> 01:20:59,955
- go way back. - Is that so?

2269
01:21:00,405 --> 01:21:02,404
- What history? - Soo Young, reject him!

2270
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:03,704
- Reject him. - Soo Young and I...

2271
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:05,843
have worked on a TV show for a long time.

2272
01:21:05,844 --> 01:21:07,330
(Booing)

2273
01:21:07,544 --> 01:21:08,984
- That's pathetic! - Soo Young.

2274
01:21:08,985 --> 01:21:10,013
- Your lines suck. - Reject him!

2275
01:21:10,014 --> 01:21:12,378
Come on, send him to the Anxious Bench.

2276
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:15,147
- He's feeling arrogant. - He'd be a perfect match here.

2277
01:21:15,624 --> 01:21:16,753
- All right. - Give him what he deserves.

2278
01:21:16,754 --> 01:21:19,793
Soo Young, make your decision.

2279
01:21:19,794 --> 01:21:22,763
Will it be the Single's Bench or the Couple's Bench? 1, 2, 3.

2280
01:21:22,764 --> 01:21:25,894
(Will she choose Jae Seok and go to the Couple's Bench?)

2281
01:21:25,895 --> 01:21:29,003
(Or will she go to the Single Bench for other partners?)

2282
01:21:29,004 --> 01:21:31,003
(Jae Seok as my partner?)

2283
01:21:31,004 --> 01:21:32,217
I'm sorry.

2284
01:21:32,504 --> 01:21:33,545
Okay!

2285
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:35,944
(Jae Seok is decided to head to the Anxious Bench.)

2286
01:21:35,945 --> 01:21:37,543
- Okay. - Okay.

2287
01:21:37,544 --> 01:21:39,314
Okay. This is great.

2288
01:21:39,315 --> 01:21:40,774
(They come to fetch the new member.)

2289
01:21:40,775 --> 01:21:42,583
- So many of them came out. - Let go!

2290
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:44,907
(She chooses to be an awesome single.)

2291
01:21:45,914 --> 01:21:47,784
- Choi Soo Young! - Merry Christmas!

2292
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:49,684
- Merry Christmas. - Choi Soo Young!

2293
01:21:49,685 --> 01:21:51,894
- You're on the Anxious Bench now. - Okay.

2294
01:21:51,895 --> 01:21:53,494
- Goodness. - What a great move by Soo Young.

2295
01:21:53,495 --> 01:21:55,384
- Haha. - That was great.

2296
01:21:55,495 --> 01:21:58,534
- Jae Seok. - I didn't want to be her partner.

2297
01:21:58,535 --> 01:21:59,734
(Acting childishly)

2298
01:21:59,735 --> 01:22:01,604
(She's speechless.)

2299
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:03,003
I didn't want her as my partner either.

2300
01:22:03,004 --> 01:22:05,404
- You're saying that now? - This is great for the both of us.

2301
01:22:05,405 --> 01:22:07,495
(It's fun to watch this dirty fight.)

2302
01:22:07,905 --> 01:22:11,409
By the way, the second guest hasn't come out yet.

2303
01:22:12,115 --> 01:22:13,792
- Oh, that's right. - Right now,

2304
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:15,913
no one chose the second guest.

2305
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:17,883
(Because of this scary drawing, the 2nd guest has been overlooked.)

2306
01:22:17,884 --> 01:22:20,454
(One by one, the other guests disappeared through the doors.)

2307
01:22:20,455 --> 01:22:24,623
(While everyone is having fun, talking to other people,)

2308
01:22:24,624 --> 01:22:25,654
(the guest has been staring at the wall.)

2309
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:28,824
You can come to us. Please come on out.

2310
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:30,293
Who is the guest?

2311
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:31,564
- Is he Park Hwi Soon? - Who is he?

2312
01:22:31,565 --> 01:22:34,291
(Who is this guest with weird abs and who aren't fully clothed?)

2313
01:22:35,164 --> 01:22:37,559
- It's Sung Hoon. - It's Sung Hoon.

2314
01:22:38,205 --> 01:22:44,336
(His acting is as firm as his abs, and he's off-the-wall.)

2315
01:22:44,645 --> 01:22:47,140
(I ended up introducing myself pretty late.)

2316
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:49,972
- It's Sung Hoon. - I should've chosen that one.

2317
01:22:50,985 --> 01:22:52,197
My gosh, his drawing...

2318
01:22:53,685 --> 01:22:55,354
Why did he draw that kind of a drawing?

2319
01:22:55,355 --> 01:22:56,984
- Hello. - That was Sung Hoon.

2320
01:22:56,985 --> 01:22:58,994
Isn't that his photo from the triathlon?

2321
01:22:58,995 --> 01:23:00,307
- I guess it is. - Aren't I right?

2322
01:23:00,495 --> 01:23:02,564
- It's for the swimming part. - I see. It's his swimsuit.

2323
01:23:02,565 --> 01:23:05,190
- That wasn't a zipper. - How many lines do you have there?

2324
01:23:05,365 --> 01:23:06,663
- Zipper? - What's that?

2325
01:23:06,664 --> 01:23:08,564
Now, the three guests from the Single's Bench can take...

2326
01:23:08,565 --> 01:23:10,003
partners from Couple's Bench too.

2327
01:23:10,004 --> 01:23:12,003
- Really? We'll go one by one. - Okay, okay.

2328
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:13,954
- Sure. - Ha Na, you will go first.

2329
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:15,574
Ha Na, you're ups first.

2330
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:16,716
- Me? - Yes.

2331
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:20,683
Ha Na, you can call out the person you want to partner up with.

2332
01:23:20,815 --> 01:23:22,213
- Really? - Yes.

2333
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:24,537
- Okay. - She glanced at Kwang Soo.

2334
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:26,184
(Which one should I steal?)

2335
01:23:26,185 --> 01:23:28,083
(Glancing)

2336
01:23:28,084 --> 01:23:29,583
- Okay. - She glanced at Kwang Soo.

2337
01:23:29,584 --> 01:23:31,574
(I'm right, aren't I? She really looked at Kwang Soo.)

2338
01:23:31,995 --> 01:23:33,194
Kwang Soo!

2339
01:23:33,195 --> 01:23:34,305
(I don't know anymore.)

2340
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:35,894
(She wants to steal Seon Hwa's partner, Kwang Soo.)

2341
01:23:35,895 --> 01:23:37,723
- You're popular. - Did you choose Kwang Soo?

2342
01:23:37,724 --> 01:23:40,088
- Is it Kwang Soo? - Did you choose Kwang Soo?

2343
01:23:40,365 --> 01:23:42,627
He's tempted. He's tempted.

2344
01:23:42,634 --> 01:23:44,934
- That serves you right, Seon Hwa! - My gosh, Kwang Soo. Okay!

2345
01:23:44,935 --> 01:23:46,551
- That serves you right! - Okay.

2346
01:23:46,775 --> 01:23:49,303
- Ha Na chose you, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

2347
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:51,173
- Come this way, Seon Hwa. - This is funny.

2348
01:23:51,174 --> 01:23:52,774
- My gosh. - There's nothing we can do.

2349
01:23:52,775 --> 01:23:56,184
Seon Hwa, I get that you're dumbfounded, but this is a rule.

2350
01:23:56,185 --> 01:23:57,784
- This is ridiculous. - There's nothing I can do.

2351
01:23:57,785 --> 01:23:59,977
- It's ridiculous, but it's a rule. - Okay.

2352
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:02,583
- First of all, you must choose... - Lee.

2353
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:04,253
(That case, let's do the poem.)

2354
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:06,293
(He holds an acrostic poem contest with his name, Lee Kwang Soo.)

2355
01:24:06,294 --> 01:24:09,194
- I have to listen to her poem. - All right. You don't have to.

2356
01:24:09,195 --> 01:24:12,123
- No, I'm going to try. - The first line.

2357
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:16,364
Listen to this weird vibe today.

2358
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:18,034
(Yes, it is a bit off.)

2359
01:24:18,035 --> 01:24:19,690
The second line.

2360
01:24:20,105 --> 01:24:22,063
Kwang Soo, it's me.

2361
01:24:23,405 --> 01:24:27,173
(You promised to be my partner earlier.)

2362
01:24:27,174 --> 01:24:28,224
The last one.

2363
01:24:28,714 --> 01:24:31,713
Squish my suspicion away.

2364
01:24:31,714 --> 01:24:33,454
(What? Squish your suspicion away?)

2365
01:24:33,455 --> 01:24:34,727
She doesn't want you to get tempted.

2366
01:24:34,754 --> 01:24:36,883
- All right. Her poem was so-so. - Yes.

2367
01:24:36,884 --> 01:24:38,541
(The beginning of her poem was great.)

2368
01:24:38,754 --> 01:24:40,154
- It was so-so. - I want to do it again.

2369
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:41,394
- It was so-so. - How heartwarming.

2370
01:24:41,395 --> 01:24:43,293
Ha Na, it's your turn. The first line.

2371
01:24:43,294 --> 01:24:45,793
(Ha Na will try her poem with the keyword, Lee Kwang Soo.)

2372
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,833
Look at this man. He's quite decent.

2373
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:49,803
(Look at this man. He's quite decent.)

2374
01:24:49,804 --> 01:24:51,803
(I'm decent? What does that mean?)

2375
01:24:51,804 --> 01:24:53,147
- Kwang Soo likes it. - He likes it.

2376
01:24:53,374 --> 01:24:55,104
- She got his attention. - Look at his smile.

2377
01:24:55,105 --> 01:24:56,993
- He's smiling. - Oh, no. Look at Kwang Soo.

2378
01:24:57,544 --> 01:24:59,713
- Was that line from a drama? - Right.

2379
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:01,413
- That sounded really pleasant. - It was in a drama.

2380
01:25:01,414 --> 01:25:02,713
- It sounded like a line in a drama. - Sure, sure.

2381
01:25:02,714 --> 01:25:03,755
The second line.

2382
01:25:04,245 --> 01:25:06,305
Kwang Soo, you. I like you.

2383
01:25:07,384 --> 01:25:08,394
The last one.

2384
01:25:08,754 --> 01:25:10,905
(She's good. Seon Hwa is getting nervous.)

2385
01:25:11,254 --> 01:25:13,994
- Soo. - Sweep me off my feet, will you?

2386
01:25:13,995 --> 01:25:15,463
(Sweep me off my feet, will you?)

2387
01:25:15,464 --> 01:25:17,494
(It was the perfect ending.)

2388
01:25:17,495 --> 01:25:19,293
- Okay! - That was great!

2389
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:20,564
(I want to sweep you off your feet right now.)

2390
01:25:20,565 --> 01:25:21,575
I'm embarrassed.

2391
01:25:21,834 --> 01:25:23,404
- Good. - It was a nice twist.

2392
01:25:23,405 --> 01:25:26,333
- Good. - Okay. Great!

2393
01:25:26,674 --> 01:25:27,833
(Kwang Soo, come on. Go sweet her off her feet.)

2394
01:25:27,834 --> 01:25:29,473
- She's cute. - Good.

2395
01:25:29,474 --> 01:25:31,003
(She shows off her charms with a bold ending.)

2396
01:25:31,004 --> 01:25:32,314
- It was a nice twist. - All right.

2397
01:25:32,315 --> 01:25:35,920
Which one will go to the Single's Bench? You may send her off there.

2398
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:37,730
1, 2, 3.

2399
01:25:38,115 --> 01:25:39,114
Grab his hand.

2400
01:25:39,115 --> 01:25:40,184
(Reaching out carefully)

2401
01:25:40,185 --> 01:25:41,684
(Can you hold my hand, Seon Hwa?)

2402
01:25:41,685 --> 01:25:43,484
- Okay. Hold his hand for now. - I'm not out yet?

2403
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:45,354
(What is this? Why is he holding my hand?)

2404
01:25:45,355 --> 01:25:47,723
(What do you think? You're heading to the Single's Bench.)

2405
01:25:47,724 --> 01:25:49,894
(He escorts her to the Single's Bench like a gentleman.)

2406
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,106
Congratulations.

2407
01:25:51,164 --> 01:25:53,163
(She joins the Single's Bench after losing her partner.)

2408
01:25:53,164 --> 01:25:55,325
- That's mean. - Congratulations, Seon Hwa.

2409
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:58,192
You and Ha Na will partner up. Come this way, please.

2410
01:25:58,874 --> 01:26:00,534
Next up is Soo Young.

2411
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:02,303
(Soo Young tries to get a partner.)

2412
01:26:02,304 --> 01:26:04,324
(You should have partnered up with me earlier.)

2413
01:26:04,775 --> 01:26:07,340
Which member do you want to pair up with?

2414
01:26:07,645 --> 01:26:09,213
- I would like to... - Okay.

2415
01:26:09,214 --> 01:26:12,713
partner up with a member I was mean to last time I was here.

2416
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,814
- Who is it? - It's Jong Kook.

2417
01:26:14,815 --> 01:26:15,984
(She deceived her partner to the end.)

2418
01:26:15,985 --> 01:26:20,894
(Soo Young won the race as the villainous spy.)

2419
01:26:20,895 --> 01:26:25,163
(Jong Kook got the water bomb for trusting Jong Kook.)

2420
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:27,763
Okay. Things happen, you know.

2421
01:26:27,764 --> 01:26:28,904
(Acting cool)

2422
01:26:28,905 --> 01:26:30,763
(He gets rid of any bad memories with Soo Young.)

2423
01:26:30,764 --> 01:26:32,704
- That's all right. - Will you understand her?

2424
01:26:32,705 --> 01:26:34,003
- Of course. - You can understand that?

2425
01:26:34,004 --> 01:26:35,003
Yes, it was for the show.

2426
01:26:35,004 --> 01:26:36,904
- I made him get the water bomb. - Right.

2427
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:38,574
- You remember that, do you? - Up until yesterday, Jong Kook...

2428
01:26:38,575 --> 01:26:41,274
badmouthed her behind her back. He criticized her a lot.

2429
01:26:41,275 --> 01:26:43,784
- What is this? - I'm serious. I don't mind that.

2430
01:26:43,785 --> 01:26:45,814
Anyway, since no one has come forward for them,

2431
01:26:45,815 --> 01:26:47,814
- these two will partner up. - Okay!

2432
01:26:47,815 --> 01:26:49,083
(Jong Kook and Soo Young will partner up.)

2433
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:51,821
It's your turn, Sung Hoon. Sung Hoon.

2434
01:26:52,395 --> 01:26:54,071
- I like Sung Hoon. - Me too.

2435
01:26:54,825 --> 01:26:56,194
- Sung Hoon. - I like him too.

2436
01:26:56,195 --> 01:26:57,364
Let's partner up.

2437
01:26:57,365 --> 01:26:59,254
Is there anyone you'd like to partner up with?

2438
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:01,364
Yes, there is. I had this member in mind from the start.

2439
01:27:01,365 --> 01:27:02,475
Who is this member?

2440
01:27:03,804 --> 01:27:06,864
(I'm the only female member left. Sung Hoon, it's me, right?)

2441
01:27:07,504 --> 01:27:09,564
- Who is it? - It's Haha.

2442
01:27:09,905 --> 01:27:11,303
- Really? - What about Ji Hyo?

2443
01:27:11,304 --> 01:27:13,114
(Haha, do you want to be my partner?)

2444
01:27:13,115 --> 01:27:15,235
- Are you all right? - Are you serious?

2445
01:27:15,414 --> 01:27:16,713
- Wait. - What is this?

2446
01:27:16,714 --> 01:27:18,753
- Ji Hyo is there. What about her? - My goodness.

2447
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:20,013
Poor Ji Hyo.

2448
01:27:20,014 --> 01:27:21,984
- Why does everyone like Haha? - What's his charm?

2449
01:27:21,985 --> 01:27:24,484
I love it! I love it!

2450
01:27:24,485 --> 01:27:26,980
- Hold on. - Haha is mine!

2451
01:27:27,155 --> 01:27:28,205
What's wrong with him?

2452
01:27:28,254 --> 01:27:29,293
(Haha and Sung Hoon partner up.)

2453
01:27:29,294 --> 01:27:31,934
- It's a male couple. - I like it.

2454
01:27:31,935 --> 01:27:35,743
Seon Hwa, you must choose now.

2455
01:27:36,035 --> 01:27:38,429
All right. Seon Hwa. One...

2456
01:27:38,905 --> 01:27:40,104
- With me? - Han.

2457
01:27:40,105 --> 01:27:42,373
(Jae Seok, do the poem.)

2458
01:27:42,374 --> 01:27:44,173
(Will you do the poem with my name, Han Seon Hwa?)

2459
01:27:44,174 --> 01:27:45,314
(My gosh, this is unbelievable.)

2460
01:27:45,315 --> 01:27:46,543
You should. You have to.

2461
01:27:46,544 --> 01:27:47,913
- Or you should stay as single. - You should do the poem.

2462
01:27:47,914 --> 01:27:49,513
- This is your last chance. - You should do it.

2463
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,684
- It's the last one. - We should have a great poem.

2464
01:27:51,685 --> 01:27:53,513
- Hold on. - We need a great poem.

2465
01:27:53,514 --> 01:27:55,171
Exactly. We should have one.

2466
01:27:55,355 --> 01:27:57,083
- You must show us. - My gosh. I...

2467
01:27:57,084 --> 01:27:59,114
You should take out your hand from your pocket.

2468
01:27:59,554 --> 01:28:02,190
- Gather your hands. - Stand up properly.

2469
01:28:02,565 --> 01:28:04,093
Stand up properly.

2470
01:28:04,094 --> 01:28:06,388
If you can, you should take off your glasses.

2471
01:28:07,565 --> 01:28:09,463
- He's all ready now. - You should start the poem.

2472
01:28:09,464 --> 01:28:11,604
- There you go. Okay. - Gosh, look at Jae Seok.

2473
01:28:11,605 --> 01:28:12,673
- Go ahead. Han. - Han Seon Hwa.

2474
01:28:12,674 --> 01:28:13,746
- Go ahead. Han. - Han Seon Hwa.

2475
01:28:14,735 --> 01:28:15,885
Seon.

2476
01:28:16,105 --> 01:28:17,821
Seon Hwa, what took you so long to join us?

2477
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:20,134
- Hwa. - How angry I am!

2478
01:28:20,945 --> 01:28:23,083
(I'm so angry that you joined us now.)

2479
01:28:23,084 --> 01:28:24,913
- How angry I am! - Great.

2480
01:28:24,914 --> 01:28:26,654
- Great. I knew you could do it. - Was that nice?

2481
01:28:26,655 --> 01:28:27,883
- Great. - How angry I am!

2482
01:28:27,884 --> 01:28:28,984
- Great. - That was great.

2483
01:28:28,985 --> 01:28:31,782
- She and I will partner up. - My gosh.

2484
01:28:33,054 --> 01:28:34,093
(Jae Seok and Seon Hwa, Ji Hyo and Se Chan)

2485
01:28:34,094 --> 01:28:35,093
(Jong Kook and Soo Young, Haha and Sung Hoon)

2486
01:28:35,094 --> 01:28:36,093
(Kwang Soo and Ha Na, Seok Jin and Hye Bin)

2487
01:28:36,094 --> 01:28:37,123
(Chi Yeul and So Min)

2488
01:28:37,124 --> 01:28:40,194
Today's race will be carried out with seven couples.

2489
01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:43,463
It's a Christmas Special Race, Flirting Santa Claus.

2490
01:28:43,464 --> 01:28:46,808
A special secret is hidden in today's race.

2491
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:49,673
(It's not just a couple's race. There's a secret in today's race.)

2492
01:28:49,674 --> 01:28:52,099
- I knew it. - There's a secret.

2493
01:28:52,374 --> 01:28:54,814
In the center of today's secret...

2494
01:28:54,815 --> 01:28:56,502
stands Jee Seok Jin.

2495
01:28:57,285 --> 01:28:59,654
(Jee Seok Jin is in the center of today's secret?)

2496
01:28:59,655 --> 01:29:01,253
- Me? - You did something again.

2497
01:29:01,254 --> 01:29:02,769
- Really? - I am?

2498
01:29:02,924 --> 01:29:04,723
- Do you not know? - I don't know.

2499
01:29:04,724 --> 01:29:06,210
(What's the race about where he's in the center of the secret?)

2500
01:29:06,724 --> 01:29:08,038
I don't know anything.

2501
01:29:09,464 --> 01:29:11,110
(I didn't do anything!)

2502
01:29:12,294 --> 01:29:14,819
(Promise me that you didn't do anything)

2503
01:29:15,134 --> 01:29:17,204
(The year-end party begins putting aside Seok Jin's secret.)

2504
01:29:17,205 --> 01:29:20,507
(It's the ultimate year-end party.)

2505
01:29:21,374 --> 01:29:23,173
(Presents are prepared for members who worked hard for a year.)

2506
01:29:23,174 --> 01:29:25,814
(As they open up presents, Seok Jin begins to act suspiciously.)

2507
01:29:25,815 --> 01:29:28,714
(Is something going on with Seok Jin?)

2508
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:33,526
(A shocking twist that concerns Seok Jin)

2509
01:29:34,084 --> 01:29:35,539
I'm on the fifth floor.

2510
01:29:36,424 --> 01:29:39,526
(What is the truth that Seok Jin is hiding?)

2511
01:29:40,724 --> 01:29:42,341
(The Easy Brothers are back.)
