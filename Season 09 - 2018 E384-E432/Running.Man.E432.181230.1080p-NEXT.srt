1
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:08,902
(Last week)

2
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:10,541
(Which members served the penalty?)

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:13,582
(The members voted for Seok Jin and Kwang Soo to do the penalty.)

4
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:16,542
(These two members were resolute to take their revenge.)

5
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:20,152
(And unexpectedly, they are given a chance to take their revenge.)

6
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,551
(However, the staff has prepared conditions for them.)

7
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,891
(One of their identities as Furious Santa will be revealed.)

8
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,062
(Despite the unfavorable conditions,)

9
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,192
(they demonstrate a strong will to get their revenge.)

10
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,631
Today...

11
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,661
(And today's couple's race has begun at last.)

12
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,671
(In the center of today's secret stands Jee Seok Jin.)

13
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:44,942
(The members begin to suspect him after he has been singled out.)

14
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:47,542
(Will they be able to successfully take their revenge?)

15
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:50,752
(After choosing their partners...)

16
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:52,811
I saw "About Time" yesterday. It was really good.

17
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,152
It's good, isn't it?

18
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:55,551
- "About Time" is a great movie. - Hey.

19
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:57,392
Lately, I've been feeling really sentimental.

20
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:58,392
(Glancing)

21
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:01,762
- Right, right. - He travels back in time, right?

22
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,762
- That's the one. - That movie is so good.

23
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:07,062
(After the Santas exchange mysterious eye contact,)

24
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:12,101
(Kwang Soo starts off.)

25
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:15,642
(He avoids eye contact in a rush.)

26
00:01:16,771 --> 00:01:18,911
(He's acting strange.)

27
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:22,142
(Kwang Soo heads to the back of the set.)

28
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:26,151
(Looking around)

29
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,821
I can't do anything.

30
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,851
Kwang Soo, what are you looking for?

31
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,521
(Startled)

32
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,761
Water. I'm looking for water.

33
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,562
(He gives a pathetic excuse.)

34
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:38,761
(Kwang Soo, what are you looking for?)

35
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,291
I'm looking for water.

36
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,661
- What are you looking for? - Water.

37
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:44,071
Why are you looking for it there? It's here. Come. Take this here.

38
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,232
Haha, Kwang Soo keeps doing strange stuff in the back.

39
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,271
Kwang Soo, what are you doing?

40
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,642
- I really went for some water. - It's on the floor.

41
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,011
Why would you go there to look?

42
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:54,181
(Several hours before the filming)

43
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,711
What can we do to win this race? That's the hard part.

44
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:58,452
- We have to win. Right? - That's right.

45
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,282
We're doing an important mission today, right?

46
00:02:01,282 --> 00:02:04,452
Were there any personal belongings of the members that bothered you...

47
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,622
or that you didn't want to see?

48
00:02:06,722 --> 00:02:08,361
Something that bothered me or I didn't want to see?

49
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,161
Write one item for each member.

50
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,462
(I'll write it down since you asked, but what is this all of a sudden?)

51
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:14,261
- "Jae Seok". Hold on. - Things I don't want to see?

52
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:16,731
- His tight pants. - Tight pants.

53
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:17,802
I hate seeing him in them.

54
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:20,772
He can wear loose pants like chino pants,

55
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,772
- but he never wears those. - When you look at his feet,

56
00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:24,671
they are always purple because his blood doesn't circulate.

57
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,911
Those are leggings, not pants.

58
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,011
Besides, he has really skinny legs.

59
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,652
- Tight pants for Jae Seok. - Yes, let's go with tight pants.

60
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,212
Okay. Tight pants.

61
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,522
Jong Kook? Black clothes.

62
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,092
- Black outfits and... - Black outfits.

63
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,622
Jong Kook even wears a black bag to go with his outfit.

64
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:42,361
- He suddenly started wearing it. - What's in it anyway?

65
00:02:42,992 --> 00:02:46,631
When he takes off that bag, I end up giving up on the game.

66
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:48,361
(They chose this because it's scary.)

67
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:50,802
The moment he takes it off, I know that I'm done for the day.

68
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,972
- Write down the black bag. - Yes, the bag.

69
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:55,002
What kind of a bag is that? What's that called?

70
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,402
He said it was a messenger bag.

71
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:57,972
For Haha, it's probably his cell phone.

72
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:58,972
What's up with his phone?

73
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,111
It's just that...

74
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,111
(I have this.)

75
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,552
(For now, I want you to blur out the photo.)

76
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,951
(Why is Kwang Soo obsessing over Haha's cell phone?)

77
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,851
(Haha stores records of Kwang Soo's private life...)

78
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:12,821
(and weaknesses in his phone.)

79
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,722
This is one of the wishes I pray for every week.

80
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:17,731
I want Haha to lose his phone.

81
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,361
Haha's cell phone is like a Pandora's box.

82
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,161
- Don't you remember your birthday? - I know, I know.

83
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,872
He took a photo when Seok Jin was peeing in an alien costume.

84
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,171
- Don't you think that was too mean? - He posted it on his social media.

85
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:29,101
He wrote, "Happy birthday".

86
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,712
Let's go with his cell phone.

87
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,712
He's infuriating.

88
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,641
At some point, she's always wearing hats.

89
00:03:35,742 --> 00:03:37,351
I don't think she washes her hair.

90
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,581
(She's way too down-to-earth.)

91
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:40,052
I wasn't the only one thinking that.

92
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,552
I only thought about it in my head.

93
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:43,821
- Let's go with hats. - Hats.

94
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:44,951
- Let's write down hats. - Hats.

95
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,622
(Hats are chosen for Ji Hyo.)

96
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,092
I don't know when it happened,

97
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,861
but So Min started to get attached to her nickname, Frog.

98
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,291
Whenever she uploads posts on her social media account,

99
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:54,402
she uses a lot of frog emoticons.

100
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:55,932
She has a lot of frog-related stuff.

101
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,062
Frog-related items.

102
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:59,272
- Frog. - Yes, frog.

103
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,502
You know the plaid pattern?

104
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,842
- Yes, yes. - They're all checkered.

105
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,571
Sometimes, even his coat has the checkered pattern.

106
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,972
He likes checkered coats.

107
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:08,782
- Checkered clothes. - Checkered clothes.

108
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:10,682
Okay, checkered clothes.

109
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,451
We're done.

110
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,851
(Tight pants, hats, black messenger bag,)

111
00:04:14,851 --> 00:04:16,881
(frog-related items, cell phone, and checkered clothes)

112
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:18,992
(But why are we writing these down?)

113
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,192
Today,

114
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:21,922
before the race ends,

115
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:26,531
you must steal all of the six items you have just written down.

116
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:29,562
(Steal all the annoying items before today's race ends.)

117
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:32,071
(They will win if they put all of these items in a producer's bag.)

118
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,271
If you bring these items to an assigned place, you will win.

119
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:38,242
If you can't steal all of the items before the race finishes,

120
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,442
for every item you fail to steal,

121
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,742
you will face the penalty.

122
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,122
Wait, how are we supposed to... After we steal it...

123
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,821
If we can't steal anything,

124
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:50,922
- we'll have six penalties. - Yes.

125
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:52,651
This is...

126
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,922
This is impossible.

127
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:56,391
Don't be disappointed yet.

128
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:58,331
- Why not? Is there more? - We have invited...

129
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:01,502
an assistant who will help you.

130
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:02,831
There's an assistant?

131
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:03,872
(An assistant will help the Furious Santas?)

132
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,471
Who is it?

133
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,542
(Who is the assistant?)

134
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,271
- Hey, hello. - Hey.

135
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,112
My goodness.

136
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,482
(Who is the assistant that will help these two members?)

137
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:18,312
(And will they be able to complete their revenge mission?)

138
00:05:18,312 --> 00:05:19,451
Kwang Soo. Why...

139
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,122
- You're suddenly acting strange. - Rip off his name tag.

140
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,151
Why are you going off on your own?

141
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,292
I guess he must have gotten a hint.

142
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:28,221
- He's looking for hints now. - He is, right?

143
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:30,021
(Feeling nervous)

144
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,062
By the way,

145
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,792
why are you filming us if Seok Jin is in the center of this?

146
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,201
Did you choose me after getting a mission?

147
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,372
No, not at all.

148
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,002
- I'm serious. I really didn't. - This is strange.

149
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,242
Something is off. Sung Hoon chose Haha.

150
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,511
- Yes, your choice was very odd too. - Pardon?

151
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:47,442
No, Jae Seok. I'm really shy around people I first meet.

152
00:05:47,482 --> 00:05:48,711
They're suspecting everything.

153
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:51,451
It's odd that Ha Na chose Kwang Soo too.

154
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,581
(Se Chan can't understand her choice.)

155
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:55,651
- Why is that odd? - That's just odd.

156
00:05:55,651 --> 00:05:58,091
- Isn't that weird she chose you? - You're weirder!

157
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,862
- Seriously. Right. - Yes, it's odd that she chose him.

158
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,821
I don't think Ha Na likes Kwang Soo that much.

159
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:05,932
I don't think she likes him that much.

160
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,232
She said that she kept thinking about me after the filming.

161
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,901
I get it now. No one trusts each other on this show.

162
00:06:12,732 --> 00:06:14,372
- This is odd. - It's very strange.

163
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:17,872
A hint about the secret is at stake on the first mission.

164
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:19,242
(The mission starts at last.)

165
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:21,881
(A hint about the secret is at stake on the first mission.)

166
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,841
It's Party Tree.

167
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,682
(Party Tree)

168
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:27,252
- What? - Party Tree?

169
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,552
- Party Tree? - If you look at that side,

170
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:32,521
- on top of seven gift boxes, - Yes, I see them.

171
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:36,862
envelopes with different keywords are placed.

172
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:40,461
After checking the keyword, you may try it out as a couple.

173
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:43,662
The couple that draws out the most sympathy from other couples...

174
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,571
- will acquire the hint. - Okay.

175
00:06:45,932 --> 00:06:48,071
Please choose the first gift box.

176
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:49,172
(What is the first keyword?)

177
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,841
- Should we go with the big one? - Shall we?

178
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:52,341
- Let's be bold and get the big one. - What about you?

179
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:54,042
I want the apricot-colored box.

180
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:55,881
- I wanted that one too. - Because...

181
00:06:55,942 --> 00:06:57,552
Stop lying.

182
00:06:57,552 --> 00:06:59,812
- I bet that wasn't the one. - I wanted that one.

183
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,122
Kwang Soo, stop lying. What? Come on.

184
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:05,252
- Earlier, Seok Jin was... - Stop lying.

185
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,352
(Why did she pick the apricot one?)

186
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:09,422
wearing an outfit that had a similar color with the box.

187
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:11,692
- I see. With Seok Jin's outfit? - I was?

188
00:07:14,232 --> 00:07:18,232
(The apricot outfit of Seok Jin, in the center of the secret...)

189
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:21,071
(and the apricot-colored gift box)

190
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,971
Oh, right. You're paying attention to that.

191
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,912
- You're paying attention to that. - She's right.

192
00:07:26,912 --> 00:07:28,211
It's related to Seok Jin.

193
00:07:28,912 --> 00:07:29,912
That was sharp.

194
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:32,151
(Will that box's keyword have a special meaning?)

195
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,451
I'll choose one of the boxes there.

196
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:36,122
Let me try this out.

197
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:37,651
- This one? - No.

198
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,021
That wasn't loud. How about this one?

199
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,052
(Booing)

200
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:41,761
- This one? - Yes!

201
00:07:41,992 --> 00:07:44,091
(Let's go with the apricot-colored box!)

202
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,631
We will narrow down our choices to these three boxes.

203
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,131
- Okay. - We'll choose 1 of the 3.

204
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,761
(My gosh, that playful guy.)

205
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:51,232
- This one? - Yes!

206
00:07:51,232 --> 00:07:53,432
(Jae Seok, the MC, is hooked on playing the MC of this game.)

207
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,701
- Yes! - Yes!

208
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:56,042
This one?

209
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,971
(Screaming furiously)

210
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,112
This one?

211
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,912
(He's out of energy.)

212
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,242
This one is out! This box is out.

213
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:04,511
I didn't hear anyone screaming.

214
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:06,982
- I didn't hear anything. - We're late.

215
00:08:07,211 --> 00:08:09,422
This one is out. Should we pick this one?

216
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:11,492
- We'll go with this box. - Okay.

217
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,451
(What are his criteria?)

218
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,792
- What is this? - What is this?

219
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,162
- What is this? - What is it?

220
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,992
- What was that? - We wasted energy for no reason.

221
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:21,162
- We just wasted our energy. - What was that for?

222
00:08:21,162 --> 00:08:23,761
I didn't... I didn't hear anyone cheering.

223
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:26,531
I didn't hear any cheer.

224
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,571
All right. I'll give you the topic.

225
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:32,141
"I have had a memorable date on Christmas."

226
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,382
No way.

227
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,182
- A date? - Everyone.

228
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,481
- Date? - On Christmas?

229
00:08:37,652 --> 00:08:39,251
A date on Christmas?

230
00:08:39,251 --> 00:08:41,922
Tell us about your memorable date. Which one of you will go first?

231
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,422
- I'll go first. - So Min.

232
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,321
(So Min confidently tries it first.)

233
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,721
- She's taking the lead. - I bet hers is a crazy story.

234
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:49,491
- Tell them a good one. - So Min.

235
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:52,262
It was when I was 24.

236
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:53,692
(What is the story about?)

237
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,262
It was that place in Yongin.

238
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,762
My boyfriend wanted to go there.

239
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:59,172
- I see. The amusement park? - Yes, yes.

240
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,571
- Okay. - So...

241
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,272
But the thing is that...

242
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:04,611
- tickets are pricey on Christmas. - Right, they are expensive.

243
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:05,971
You know the coupons?

244
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:09,211
Somehow, he managed to get those coupons,

245
00:09:09,412 --> 00:09:10,981
so I went to the amusement park.

246
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,851
We took the bus together.

247
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:15,821
We were listening to Hajji and TJ's "Glittering Stars".

248
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,491
She likes Hajji and TJ.

249
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,351
She's a big fan of Hajji and TJ.

250
00:09:20,451 --> 00:09:22,892
Right. The bus windows were really steamy...

251
00:09:22,892 --> 00:09:24,361
because there were so many people.

252
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,861
We were sitting on the bus.

253
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:27,062
We shared the earphones on our way there.

254
00:09:27,062 --> 00:09:28,902
- You were listening to their song? - Yes.

255
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,371
We were going there while listening to Hajji and TJ's songs.

256
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,632
We were about to go inside.

257
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,172
My ex-boyfriend went,

258
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:37,912
"Oh, no. This is bad."

259
00:09:37,971 --> 00:09:39,341
- Why? - I asked him why.

260
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:41,211
He kept sighing. I asked him what was wrong.

261
00:09:41,211 --> 00:09:42,312
Back then,

262
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,812
we had to print out the coupons ourselves.

263
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:46,611
- You had to print them out. - So...

264
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,522
he didn't know what to do, and I told him that...

265
00:09:48,682 --> 00:09:49,851
we should forget about the coupons.

266
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:51,121
He said that he couldn't.

267
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,621
He told me to wait.

268
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,262
He said he would go to a PC cafe...

269
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,892
- and print them out. - He wanted to print them out?

270
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:56,892
- So... - My gosh.

271
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,662
Poor guy.

272
00:09:58,662 --> 00:10:01,201
Back then, we were still in school.

273
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,402
(They weren't financially well-off.)

274
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,371
- Money was tight at that time. - That's right.

275
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,731
- When we were dating, we tried... - Right.

276
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,902
to save up money on our meals for our dates.

277
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,971
He took the bus to go to a PC cafe which was pretty far away.

278
00:10:10,971 --> 00:10:13,812
- PC cafes weren't nearby. - Exactly. They weren't.

279
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:15,512
After his trip to the PC cafe, we finally went in.

280
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:17,382
He went somewhere to make a call again.

281
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,312
"Wait here. I'm going to make a call."

282
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,121
Where did he keep going to?

283
00:10:21,682 --> 00:10:22,821
- Where did he go? - He kept disappearing.

284
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,121
- Seriously. - That's weird.

285
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:26,321
It seemed like he was going somewhere to check something.

286
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:29,162
(What did he check all of a sudden?)

287
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:32,392
(What did he check all of a sudden?)

288
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,591
To see how much money he had left?

289
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,331
(Nodding)

290
00:10:35,331 --> 00:10:36,501
To see how much money he had left?

291
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:38,501
- I see. - Oh, no.

292
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,172
- He was checking that. - He checked how much he had left.

293
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,172
I can totally relate to her story.

294
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,741
Back in the days, I used to check how much...

295
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:46,812
I had in my wallet so many times under the table at cafes.

296
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,211
I saved up for two weeks when I had to take out my girlfriend.

297
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:50,481
Two weeks when I was in college.

298
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,182
So did you continue to date him?

299
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:57,422
(Her relationship with a man who made the long trip for her)

300
00:10:57,422 --> 00:10:58,951
Since we were so young back then,

301
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,422
I drank too much.

302
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,762
We broke up because of that.

303
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,991
(I'm breaking up with you, you drunkard!)

304
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,162
You broke up with a lot of guys because of your drinking.

305
00:11:08,331 --> 00:11:10,262
Did you break up with him because you drank too much?

306
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,601
Goodness, So Min.

307
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,402
(For now, she's in 1st place.)

308
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,471
- I can relate to her story. - Yes, I can.

309
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,812
- I didn't have money back then. - That's right.

310
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:20,981
I would go on a date with a limited budget.

311
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:22,782
- Actually, I've never heard of... - Ji Hyo.

312
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,412
- Ji Hyo's dating stories. - Tell us one.

313
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:26,782
We've never heard of your dating stories over the past nine years.

314
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:29,022
We read about her dating life through the news articles.

315
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,851
(He's brutally honest.)

316
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:31,892
(Sinking her head)

317
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:32,991
Stop. Stop it!

318
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,062
Don't look it up! Don't look it up!

319
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,621
- Ji Hyo, I took care of it. - Okay. That's all right.

320
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,162
Okay. Tell us the truth.

321
00:11:39,162 --> 00:11:40,361
Just tell us the important bits.

322
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:42,162
Make it brief, and tell us the juicy parts.

323
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,471
Well, I dated him...

324
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:45,731
- during one of my projects. - It's after you became an actress.

325
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:48,741
(Ji Hyo's love life has been kept hidden.)

326
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,512
(And her Pandora's box...)

327
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:55,611
(will open at last.)

328
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:58,282
Since we couldn't go on dates outdoors...

329
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,581
- She was famous by then. - Was he a celebrity too?

330
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,882
- Well... - Both of them were celebrities.

331
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:03,522
- You said to make it short. - Okay.

332
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:04,591
You asked her to make it brief.

333
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,922
- Come on, don't push her. - You said that.

334
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:07,522
- Make it short. - Don't try to make it long.

335
00:12:07,522 --> 00:12:08,591
Please make it short.

336
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:10,762
- You couldn't go out for dates. - You'll hurt her.

337
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,162
- I think he was famous too. - That's too big.

338
00:12:13,162 --> 00:12:15,162
- It was me. - I think both of you were famous.

339
00:12:15,162 --> 00:12:16,632
- He was a celebrity too. - We'll make it short.

340
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,032
- You couldn't go out. - So...

341
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:21,142
We were going to spend Christmas together at home.

342
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,201
- That was the plan. - We were going to spend it at home.

343
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,272
- Great. - Right.

344
00:12:24,272 --> 00:12:25,772
You should. That's a nice way to spend Christmas.

345
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,071
When we were hanging out,

346
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:29,182
I fell asleep.

347
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,812
- My gosh. - You fell asleep again.

348
00:12:30,912 --> 00:12:32,782
- You fell asleep again? - You sure sleep a lot.

349
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:35,581
He brought me to another room when I was sleeping.

350
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,621
I saw balloons with strings...

351
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:40,152
- filling up the whole room. - Really? My goodness.

352
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:43,922
(I prepared this for you.)

353
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:46,361
There were candles in the room.

354
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:47,932
My goodness.

355
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,701
Then for how long did you sleep?

356
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:53,001
(For how long did you sleep?)

357
00:12:53,001 --> 00:12:55,142
- Let her finish. - He lit all the candles.

358
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,501
Let her finish.

359
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:58,371
Ji Hyo is a heavy sleeper, you know.

360
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:00,642
Her boyfriend probably knew that nothing would wake her up too.

361
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:01,912
He knew that I wouldn't wake up.

362
00:13:01,912 --> 00:13:04,812
He had been planning this surprise before Christmas.

363
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,552
- He ordered the balloons. - That's romantic.

364
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,951
- He ordered the candles too. - I'm jealous.

365
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,292
I was so touched. We had some wine together...

366
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,922
and had a good time.

367
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:19,062
(They had wine together.)

368
00:13:19,062 --> 00:13:20,491
And...

369
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:22,701
And?

370
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,162
They had a good time.

371
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:25,902
They had a good time. And then?

372
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:27,132
- They had a good time. - And...

373
00:13:27,132 --> 00:13:28,402
(And then...)

374
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,371
The next morning.

375
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:31,442
(She skips to the next morning.)

376
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,812
(Hold on.)

377
00:13:34,312 --> 00:13:36,312
- What happened? - Why is it already morning?

378
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,382
(What happened in the meantime?)

379
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,621
Tell us what happened during that time.

380
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,481
She skipped a part of the story.

381
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:45,621
- I mean... - You can think what you want.

382
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,321
- Ji Hyo. - It was going well.

383
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,562
She skipped some part.

384
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:50,821
The staff will edit it out anyway.

385
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,961
Are you going to skip the part?

386
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,001
You did a good job.

387
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,402
My goodness.

388
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,501
- And? - I want to hear more.

389
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,172
- The next morning. - The next morning.

390
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,001
- I'm so curious. - When I woke up,

391
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:04,871
I felt something tingling on my face.

392
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:06,211
(She felt something on her face.)

393
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:07,241
(What is it?)

394
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:08,382
It's such a gripping story.

395
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:12,081
- What could it be? - What could it be?

396
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:17,052
I thought my boyfriend was touching my face.

397
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,091
- That's so romantic. - To wake you up?

398
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,361
I thought he was trying to wake me up.

399
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:24,432
When I opened my eyes, I saw...

400
00:14:24,432 --> 00:14:26,032
(When I opened my eyes, I saw...)

401
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,831
(What did Ji Hyo see...)

402
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:33,231
(the next morning?)

403
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:36,101
The balloons had sunk,

404
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:38,371
and the strings were touching my face.

405
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:40,442
They sank?

406
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,782
All I saw was the strings.

407
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,912
- Seriously... - Ji Hyo goes to the top.

408
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,121
(Ji Hyo is in 1st place now.)

409
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,182
(My partner is the best!)

410
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:52,522
She completely got us hooked when she skipped a part.

411
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:55,792
The story really stimulated...

412
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,491
our imagination.

413
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,762
Let's go to dinner together after this.

414
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,701
(Who wants to hear the rest?)

415
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,601
(Pandora's box will be opened some other time.)

416
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:07,231
Ji Hyo, thank you for your Christmas date story.

417
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:08,371
I loved it.

418
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,402
Soo Young, do you have any story?

419
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:11,711
Of course, she does.

420
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:15,442
I have always spent Christmas...

421
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:19,081
with my family...

422
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:20,851
since I was little.

423
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,022
- With your family? - Yes.

424
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,251
You've never spent any Christmas with your boyfriend?

425
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:27,121
Well...

426
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:28,922
You've never spent any Christmas with your boyfriend?

427
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:30,591
(A sudden attack)

428
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:31,961
(She becomes weak.)

429
00:15:32,692 --> 00:15:33,831
Okay.

430
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:35,162
Okay.

431
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:36,302
You gave in.

432
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,501
Why would you bring up your family? Tell us.

433
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:41,371
You must sometimes want to be with your boyfriend.

434
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:42,442
I mean,

435
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,672
I always wanted to be with my boyfriend.

436
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,912
But I didn't even dare to dream about it.

437
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:49,741
I always had to go to church...

438
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,412
and be with...

439
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,251
(She had to go to church.)

440
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,522
This is...

441
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:56,321
She is so determined.

442
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,321
Family and church?

443
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:59,392
What can we do?

444
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:01,422
- We always have dinner together. - We failed.

445
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,662
We failed.

446
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,121
We're very devout.

447
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:06,091
I pulled out my drill,

448
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,932
but it broke.

449
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:09,402
- You lost. - I lost.

450
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:11,932
I admit it. I lost.

451
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:13,032
(The drill loses.)

452
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:14,772
You lost.

453
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,371
- Okay. - It's 1 to 0.

454
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:18,711
Sung Hoon, what about you?

455
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,312
- I have a question for him. - What is it?

456
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,682
We used to go to the same gym for a while.

457
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:27,182
- We had the same trainer. - We had the same trainer.

458
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:29,621
Sung Hoon is very tough.

459
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,221
He is not very friendly to girls.

460
00:16:33,221 --> 00:16:35,892
But I'm not like that with my girl.

461
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,632
Right. Anyway, there was another female celebrity in that gym.

462
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:43,831
And he was so nice to her.

463
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,971
(Ha Na says Sung Hoon was nice to a female celebrity.)

464
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:49,442
- Who is she? - Ha Na...

465
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:52,042
and another female celebrity were there.

466
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:53,971
- A female celebrity... - A female celebrity...

467
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,142
Hold on.

468
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:56,282
Who are you talking about?

469
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,152
(I mean that girl.)

470
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,581
(Absorbed)

471
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:02,182
(Whispering)

472
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:03,751
- It's not like that. - You heard it?

473
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,721
(Sung Hoon seems embarrassed.)

474
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,852
You're mistaken.

475
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:09,392
What exactly did you see?

476
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:13,092
He would give her a ride home.

477
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,832
(Shocked)

478
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,172
- He's only nice to his girl. - That's unbelievable.

479
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,701
(Who is this girl?)

480
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,741
It was on my way home anyway.

481
00:17:25,741 --> 00:17:27,412
You're leaning too much towards us.

482
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,211
But you never gave me a ride.

483
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:30,912
You lived somewhere else.

484
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:34,981
(Sung Hoon explains Ha Na lived somewhere else.)

485
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,251
You lived somewhere else.

486
00:17:36,251 --> 00:17:38,192
Where do you live?

487
00:17:38,192 --> 00:17:40,192
Nonhyeon-dong.

488
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,922
I lived in Nonhyeon-dong too.

489
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,192
(I lived in Nonhyeon-dong too.)

490
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,521
Why would you live there?

491
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:48,362
(He is angry Ha Na lived in Nonhyeon-dong.)

492
00:17:48,731 --> 00:17:50,531
What's wrong with her living there?

493
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:52,602
Can't Ha Na live in Nonhyeon-dong?

494
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:54,402
Why can't she live there?

495
00:17:54,402 --> 00:17:56,672
- Why would you blame her? - Why can't she?

496
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,971
You had a boyfriend back then.

497
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,041
(Sung Hoon defends himself by revealing Ha Na had a boyfriend.)

498
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,281
- I didn't. - Are you revealing everything?

499
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:03,981
(Exciting)

500
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,281
Reveal everything.

501
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:07,082
- Ha Na. - Yes?

502
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,682
Did you have a boyfriend?

503
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:11,251
I have a boyfriend now.

504
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,721
(She suddenly confesses she has a boyfriend.)

505
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:15,491
Suddenly?

506
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:16,822
- That's not what I asked. - Just answer the question.

507
00:18:16,822 --> 00:18:18,291
- There were articles. - Yes.

508
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:19,761
- There were? - Really?

509
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:21,031
She didn't answer the question.

510
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,031
- There were articles. - There were?

511
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:25,832
- What about Kwang Soo? - What about Kwang Soo?

512
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:28,072
- What's going on? - There were articles?

513
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,301
I didn't know.

514
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,301
(There were articles? Ha Na has a boyfriend?)

515
00:18:32,771 --> 00:18:36,642
(You said you thought about me.)

516
00:18:36,642 --> 00:18:41,951
(You said I looked like a nice person.)

517
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,422
- What is this? - This happens to him all the time.

518
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:46,751
You didn't know?

519
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,322
Kwang Soo.

520
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:51,162
This happens to him all the time.

521
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,132
Kwang Soo, she has a boyfriend.

522
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,632
She has a boyfriend.

523
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:58,602
I don't understand why she said she thought about me.

524
00:18:59,132 --> 00:19:01,402
Why did she think about me? When she had a boyfriend?

525
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:04,102
I didn't at that time.

526
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,511
(After all that has happened...)

527
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,942
Shouldn't Kwang Soo win?

528
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,511
(Shouldn't Kwang Soo win?)

529
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,682
I approve.

530
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,852
- Let him win. - Let him win.

531
00:19:15,852 --> 00:19:17,922
- Let him win. - That sounds good.

532
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:20,122
- He should win. - Let him win.

533
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:21,521
- Let him win. - No.

534
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:23,192
I don't want to win! It makes things more awkward.

535
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:24,221
I don't want to win.

536
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:25,491
- I'm okay. - Now.

537
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,632
Right now.

538
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,332
It's Christmas evening right now.

539
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,971
Kwang Soo wins.

540
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:39,041
(Kwang Soo and Ha Na win the Christmas date story contest.)

541
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,572
What shall we do next?

542
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,481
Which one did you say?

543
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,082
- The orange one. - The orange one.

544
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,652
- We're suspecting that. - You want this?

545
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,781
- Yes! - Yes!

546
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,122
- All of you? - Yes!

547
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,251
(Everyone wants the orange box.)

548
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:52,352
There is a letter for you.

549
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:53,852
- Please read it out loud. - Okay.

550
00:19:54,822 --> 00:19:56,061
"I have..."

551
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,592
He's trying to sound cheerful. It breaks my heart.

552
00:19:58,892 --> 00:20:01,132
(He is trying to sound cheerful.)

553
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:02,761
I'll read it.

554
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:05,201
I'll read it. You can sit down.

555
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:07,872
"I have shown off this extreme talent on a show."

556
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,072
Talent.

557
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,801
(I have shown off this extreme talent on a show.)

558
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:14,811
It can be any kind of talent.

559
00:20:14,811 --> 00:20:16,981
- Chi Yeul is an amazing dancer. - Right.

560
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,251
He is incredible.

561
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,511
He used to be a B-boy.

562
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,822
(Ballad singer Chi Yeul used to be a B-boy in Gumi.)

563
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,592
(His powerful popping took Running Man by storm.)

564
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,721
(From powerful to weird and sexy, he can pull off any kind of dance.)

565
00:20:29,892 --> 00:20:31,461
- He's amazing. - Windmill.

566
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:32,531
He can do the windmill too.

567
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,801
It's been a while.

568
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,801
- Please dance! - Let's see him dance.

569
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,672
- I mean... - Yes!

570
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,172
(He warms up.)

571
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,872
He is a great dancer.

572
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,072
He was the best dancer in Gumi.

573
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:44,301
He is so talented.

574
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,372
It's been too long.

575
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,082
(Hesitating)

576
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,511
Good.

577
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,751
(As soon as the music starts,)

578
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,281
(he starts taking steps.)

579
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:55,682
He used to be a B-boy.

580
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:57,882
(Way to go, my partner!)

581
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,551
The song is perfect for him.

582
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,162
(How did you know this is my kind of song?)

583
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,061
So light.

584
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,932
- Amazing! - So light.

585
00:21:06,092 --> 00:21:07,132
His steps are so light.

586
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,201
It's amazing.

587
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:11,201
(He is incredible.)

588
00:21:12,231 --> 00:21:13,231
Let's go!

589
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,102
(Let me spin now.)

590
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:17,142
What is this?

591
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,211
(His windmill was famous in Gumi.)

592
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,241
(He spins 4 times.)

593
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:24,912
(It's been a long time.)

594
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:26,811
- Oh, my. - Chi Yeul.

595
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:28,951
- That was amazing. - He is so talented.

596
00:21:28,951 --> 00:21:30,051
He is incredible.

597
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:31,622
- My back. - That was fantastic.

598
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:33,122
That was amazing.

599
00:21:33,122 --> 00:21:34,192
Great job.

600
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,192
While we're at it,

601
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:37,592
can any of you...

602
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,832
Jae Seok, we have 24-Hour Spinner.

603
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:42,031
- 24-Hour Spinner. - But...

604
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:43,162
24-Hour Spinner.

605
00:21:43,162 --> 00:21:44,632
(Variety show legend, 24-Hour Spinner)

606
00:21:45,231 --> 00:21:50,372
(The legendary dancer conquered the variety show with her spins.)

607
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:53,942
It's been too long. It's been more than 10 years.

608
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,511
I haven't seen it since "Love Letter".

609
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,412
Let's see it.

610
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:00,412
- Let's go! - But...

611
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,521
- Please. - It was a long time ago.

612
00:22:03,152 --> 00:22:04,422
It's been...

613
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:05,622
Take off your parka.

614
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:06,951
(Hesitating)

615
00:22:07,521 --> 00:22:09,521
Right. This song.

616
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,291
(Her theme song plays.)

617
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:13,531
Take off your parka.

618
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:15,102
This...

619
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,501
What?

620
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,001
(Her spin takes us back to the early 21st century.)

621
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:25,741
(It's an honor to see her spin in real life.)

622
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,511
(Her movements are still light as a feather.)

623
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:30,281
- 24-Hour Spinner! - She's so good!

624
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:31,481
She's still amazing.

625
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:33,211
24-Hour Spinner!

626
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,122
- She hasn't changed. - Here we go.

627
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,582
- Spin! - Let's go!

628
00:22:38,392 --> 00:22:40,122
(Let me spin once more.)

629
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,122
There she goes.

630
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:44,791
(Perfect)

631
00:22:44,791 --> 00:22:46,231
She's the best.

632
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:48,031
Stop!

633
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,201
It's embarrassing.

634
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,301
I'd never seen it before.

635
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,872
- Amazing. - It's even better in real life.

636
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:52,902
She's extraordinary.

637
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,632
She's special.

638
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:55,872
I'm overwhelmed.

639
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,001
She's an amazing dancer.

640
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:01,011
Ha Na must be a good dancer too.

641
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:02,541
- She used to be a singer. - She used to be a singer.

642
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,711
(Ha Na was a member of an idol group.)

643
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:08,451
(She made a refreshing debut as a member of Funny in 2003.)

644
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:11,221
(Ha Na is a surprisingly good dancer.)

645
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:14,291
She was a member of Funny.

646
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:17,021
Right. Funny.

647
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,162
I really don't remember it.

648
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,932
Can I dance to S.E.S. instead?

649
00:23:21,332 --> 00:23:24,132
- Okay. - I'm still living...

650
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:25,632
in the 1990s and the early 2000s.

651
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:27,832
Then we'll play something from that period.

652
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:29,672
Soo Young, do you want to join her?

653
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:31,811
- Okay. - You can dance to S.E.S, right?

654
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,912
- Of course. - Of course, she can.

655
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,912
- All right. - So Min is taking off her jacket.

656
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:38,711
- So Min is taking off her jacket. - You can do this.

657
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:40,751
- So Min is getting ready. - Take off your jacket.

658
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:42,521
Let's do this.

659
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,122
We can do this.

660
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,592
Is Soo Young Bada?

661
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,652
A high ponytail.

662
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,692
(Soo Young wants to be Bada.)

663
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:49,761
(She even copies the hairstyle.)

664
00:23:49,991 --> 00:23:51,122
That was her hairstyle.

665
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:53,031
- In the middle... - That hairstyle...

666
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,561
- Right. - Right.

667
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:57,632
- That hairstyle... - Some in the middle.

668
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,102
There you go.

669
00:23:59,832 --> 00:24:02,301
(The trident hairstyle is recreated.)

670
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,342
(It looks exactly like the original.)

671
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:07,412
Is it okay to do this?

672
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,011
It looks amazing.

673
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,511
- It's perfect. - Oh, my.

674
00:24:11,912 --> 00:24:13,481
It's the SM Entertainment hairstyle.

675
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:16,021
Let's play the song.

676
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,551
Right before that part...

677
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,221
By the way, who stands in the center during the refrain?

678
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:23,092
Who stands in the center during the refrain?

679
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:24,692
What?

680
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:27,092
She's the leader.

681
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,231
She sounds so professional.

682
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,872
- Bada... - You want to be in the center?

683
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,872
I never stood in the center in Girls' Generation.

684
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,001
- That's why? - Then you stand in the center.

685
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:37,572
- Can I do that? - Okay.

686
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,041
- We'll make way for you. - We'll make way for you.

687
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,211
- Then I'll lead the refrain. - Okay.

688
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:45,352
(Sunday, Sunday Loves Music)

689
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,652
(The debut song of the legendary fairies, S.E.S.)

690
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:56,122
(Bada sings the climax of this song in the center.)

691
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:59,231
(Will Soo Young manage to copy Bada?)

692
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,231
Now.

693
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,031
(It's your turn.)

694
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:04,602
(Perfect)

695
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:06,632
Look at that.

696
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:08,701
(She finally gets to stand in the center.)

697
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:11,501
- She stands out. - You stand out, Soo Young.

698
00:25:11,602 --> 00:25:13,172
Let's go!

699
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,612
(Here comes the refrain with Soo Young in the center.)

700
00:25:14,942 --> 00:25:16,211
(Harmony)

701
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:19,112
(Synchronized)

702
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:23,822
(They pull off the song even better than the original singers.)

703
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,822
(The fairy dance is copied perfectly.)

704
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:27,721
(But...)

705
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:28,721
(one of them is struggling.)

706
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:31,092
- It's the other direction. - It's the other direction.

707
00:25:31,092 --> 00:25:33,832
- So Min, it's the other direction. - It's the other direction.

708
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,701
- So Min. - What is she doing?

709
00:25:35,862 --> 00:25:38,832
- So Min. - So Min.

710
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:40,632
(Why can't I do it right?)

711
00:25:42,072 --> 00:25:44,602
This doesn't look right.

712
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:45,642
(She's doing well.)

713
00:25:45,642 --> 00:25:47,372
(But it's the opposite direction again.)

714
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:50,281
She stands out.

715
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:51,852
It's the other direction.

716
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,711
So Min looks happy.

717
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:57,021
(She dances in the opposite direction throughout the song.)

718
00:25:57,521 --> 00:26:00,852
(The 2018 version of "I'm Your Girl" finishes successfully.)

719
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:04,721
(It brings back memories.)

720
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:08,432
- Good job. - Soo Young, you're amazing.

721
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:10,561
- It's different. - The thing is...

722
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:14,231
We thought So Min is an amazing dancer.

723
00:26:14,231 --> 00:26:16,372
- But you guys are professional. - Right.

724
00:26:16,372 --> 00:26:18,642
- It shows. - Chi Yeul knows...

725
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:21,271
why I dance in the opposite direction.

726
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,711
It's because I've only seen it on TV.

727
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,582
It's not like someone taught her the moves.

728
00:26:26,582 --> 00:26:28,922
She just copied what she saw on TV.

729
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,481
That's why I dance in the opposite direction.

730
00:26:30,481 --> 00:26:32,852
- But you're a genius. - Why do you say that?

731
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:33,852
- I mean it. - She's good, right?

732
00:26:33,852 --> 00:26:36,291
She can copy what she sees.

733
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:39,231
- Your dance... - Aren't we doing Fin.K.L?

734
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,132
(After S.E.S, we should do Fin.K.L.)

735
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,031
- Do you want to do it? - Let's do it.

736
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:45,102
Which song do you want?

737
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:46,872
- "Eternal Love". - "Eternal Love".

738
00:26:46,932 --> 00:26:48,771
- Let's see "Eternal Love". - Hye Bin.

739
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:51,001
- I don't know the dance. - Can you do it?

740
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,612
- Seon Hwa and I will try too. - Let's do it.

741
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,642
- Do it! - Then...

742
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:57,481
- You're the dancer among us. - We have four now.

743
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:00,112
- We have four now. - I'll be Oak Joo Hyun.

744
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,822
It's an honor. They're all former idol group members.

745
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,652
- Hye Bin... - I'm the oldest here,

746
00:27:05,652 --> 00:27:07,192
so I'll be Lee Hyo Lee.

747
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,192
By the way, I'm Joo Hyun,

748
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:11,221
so when I sing, "Promise me", you should do this.

749
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,832
(Please do this.)

750
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,301
(She wants to stand out.)

751
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,332
What?

752
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,432
(She wants to be in the center this time too.)

753
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:21,031
Soo Young...

754
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:22,501
- We'll be standing in line, right? - Yes.

755
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:24,701
- She wants to be in the center. - Promise me

756
00:27:24,701 --> 00:27:26,342
She wants to be in the center.

757
00:27:26,342 --> 00:27:28,612
She's so enthusiastic.

758
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:30,582
Who will be Lee Jin﻿?

759
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:34,011
When you come out, your upper body should...

760
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:37,721
(Her upper body should lean forward.)

761
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,092
That's hard.

762
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:40,122
Like this.

763
00:27:40,122 --> 00:27:41,822
(Her upper body should be straight.)

764
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,822
What about Sung Yu Ri?

765
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:47,132
Sung Yu Ri just needs to be pretty.

766
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,632
- I like it. - So Min likes it.

767
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,761
(It's the hardest thing.)

768
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,971
It's the hardest.

769
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:54,402
Let's see Fin.K.L. It's been so long.

770
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:56,602
- I can't wait. - It's a dance cover.

771
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,572
- It's a dance cover. - Right.

772
00:27:58,572 --> 00:28:01,412
(The 2018 version of "Eternal Love" starts now.)

773
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:03,211
We should put our heads down.

774
00:28:03,211 --> 00:28:05,311
It's been so long.

775
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:08,822
(Sunday, Sunday Loves Music)

776
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:12,491
("Eternal Love" by Fin.K.L)

777
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:19,031
(How will the 2018 fairies reinterpret this performance?)

778
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:23,602
(It's Hyo Lee's part.)

779
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,632
Let's go.

780
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:26,731
(But Soo Young sings it.)

781
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,442
(Center)

782
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:30,971
- She's in the center again. - She's good.

783
00:28:30,971 --> 00:28:33,471
- She's in the center. - She's in the center.

784
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,142
- She's in the center. - It's perfect.

785
00:28:35,211 --> 00:28:38,382
- She really looks like Joo Hyun. - Right.

786
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,152
She's amazing.

787
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,852
Oh, Joo Hyun's part starts now.

788
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,182
(Always)

789
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,481
Oh, Joo Hyun's part starts now.

790
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:46,622
Here we go.

791
00:28:46,622 --> 00:28:48,021
(Your part is mine. My part is mine too.)

792
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:49,392
(Perfect)

793
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:50,922
Look at her face.

794
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:53,761
- This song makes my heart flutter. - Right.

795
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,561
- Here it comes. - Let's go!

796
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:56,862
- Let's go! - Let's go!

797
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,001
Let's go!

798
00:28:59,231 --> 00:29:01,701
(Promise me)

799
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,612
(Harmony)

800
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:11,642
(The new generation fairies' show begins.)

801
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:15,451
Why do I feel moved?

802
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:17,122
(I feel moved too.)

803
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,281
(He falls.)

804
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:19,822
What is Jae Seok doing?

805
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,291
- Jae Seok... - "Saturday, Saturday is a Singer".

806
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:24,561
(Their synchronized dance pierces your heart.)

807
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:25,592
So Min!

808
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,932
(Choi Soo Young as Oak Joo Hyun, Black)

809
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,561
(24-hour Spinner as Lee Hyo Lee, Red, leader)

810
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,832
(Jeon So Min as Sung Yu Ri, pretty)

811
00:29:33,332 --> 00:29:34,672
(Han Seon Hwa as Lee Jin, Blue)

812
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,602
Hye Bin!

813
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,572
(2018 is ours.)

814
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:42,342
- It gives me goosebumps. - I love it.

815
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,912
I love it.

816
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:47,451
(Everyone is overwhelmed.)

817
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:49,721
They're amazing.

818
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,721
(Suddenly)

819
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:54,991
(Soo Young stands in the center again.)

820
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,021
(Satisfied)

821
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,761
She looks exactly like Oak Joo Hyun.

822
00:29:58,761 --> 00:29:59,991
She looks like Jin.

823
00:29:59,991 --> 00:30:03,561
(They're in a competition, but they have fun together.)

824
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:07,672
(You're the only one)

825
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,072
That was amazing.

826
00:30:10,072 --> 00:30:11,801
Fin.K.L, come back!

827
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,842
- We love you! - Fin.K.L forever!

828
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:15,981
- Fin.K.L! - Come back!

829
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:18,511
- Fin.K.L! - Fin.K.L!

830
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:21,652
Fin.K.L!

831
00:30:21,652 --> 00:30:23,051
It's been so long.

832
00:30:24,451 --> 00:30:26,392
(I danced in the same direction as the others this time.)

833
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,422
I mean...

834
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,362
Why do I feel moved?

835
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,662
- It moved me. - Right.

836
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,132
I feel moved too.

837
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,991
It was amazing. Thank you.

838
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:36,961
- Thank you. - Thank you.

839
00:30:37,301 --> 00:30:39,632
By the way, I got a little carried away...

840
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:41,471
and fell.

841
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,801
But no one seemed to notice it.

842
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,971
I couldn't go to you.

843
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:48,811
(Did no one pay attention?)

844
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:53,511
(Jae Seok gets carried away and falls from his chair.)

845
00:30:54,382 --> 00:30:56,551
(Kwang Soo glances at him.)

846
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,582
(But he ignores it.)

847
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,221
(Jae Seok has to pretend like nothing happened.)

848
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,122
I saw you lying down on the floor.

849
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:07,632
I saw you, but I couldn't go to you.

850
00:31:07,662 --> 00:31:09,662
(Why didn't you help me?)

851
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:11,862
- You saw me? - I didn't want to miss anything.

852
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,731
We were immersed in our memories.

853
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:17,672
- I was on the floor. - We couldn't pay attention to you.

854
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:20,612
While we're at it, can we see one more?

855
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:23,382
- What? - Seon Hwa's "Madonna".

856
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:24,811
"Madonna".

857
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,082
(Seon Hwa was a member of Secret.)

858
00:31:26,082 --> 00:31:27,182
That sounds awesome!

859
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:31,582
("Madonna" is a hit song by Secret from the summer of 2010.)

860
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:34,021
(Seon Hwa, 21, was the youngest member.)

861
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,221
- "Madonna". - It's been so long.

862
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:38,561
- Can you do it? - So Min can do it.

863
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:40,392
- She can? - She can do it well.

864
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:42,932
- Can you do it? - Let's do it.

865
00:31:42,932 --> 00:31:45,261
Ji Hyo. Seon Hwa, can you show Ji Hyo?

866
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,771
How do you do it?

867
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,471
- Hands like this. - How?

868
00:31:48,801 --> 00:31:51,102
(Seon Hwa teaches the others.)

869
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:52,912
(It's easy.)

870
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,011
Ji Hyo will learn it fast.

871
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:56,842
- She's become so good. - You can do this!

872
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,011
Turn...

873
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,912
(And you shake hips.)

874
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:01,311
Good.

875
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:03,922
- That's good. - You can do it.

876
00:32:03,981 --> 00:32:06,451
Good. So Min, you're doing great.

877
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:07,521
She's so cute.

878
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:08,822
(So Min's dance is always cute and funny.)

879
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:10,461
- So Min, you're doing great. - My goodness.

880
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,231
Let's start.

881
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,632
(The practice is over.)

882
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,132
(Just do as I showed you.)

883
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,632
Let's go!

884
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:20,132
- Here we go! - 1, 2, 3, 4.

885
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,271
(It's a perfect start.)

886
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,301
Let's go!

887
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,612
That's it!

888
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:28,311
(Ji Hyo is not a bad dancer anymore.)

889
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,311
(So Min is an amazing dancer as always.)

890
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:32,082
Way to go!

891
00:32:32,082 --> 00:32:33,352
- Turn. - Amazing!

892
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,112
(My partner is so...)

893
00:32:36,382 --> 00:32:38,122
(Shaking)

894
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,192
(So Min shakes her hips twice as fast as Seon Hwa.)

895
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:42,322
- She's so cute. - There you go!

896
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,761
(So Min is so good.)

897
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:46,632
She's so fast.

898
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,932
She's so fast.

899
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:50,362
(So Min finishes up by shaking some more.)

900
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:52,432
(So Min did a great job.)

901
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:54,432
She was so fast.

902
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,402
- She's a lot faster. - She's so fast.

903
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:58,041
- So Min. - She's so fast.

904
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,672
You were even faster than Seon Hwa.

905
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:03,882
Can't we see that part again?

906
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,652
- Hye Bin wants to see it again. - Just that part.

907
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,112
- Let's see it again. - Try it again.

908
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,021
(Here she goes again.)

909
00:33:11,521 --> 00:33:12,652
I'm confused.

910
00:33:13,051 --> 00:33:14,051
Let's go.

911
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,251
2, 3.

912
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:17,221
(Powerful moves)

913
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:21,662
(She has the real moves.)

914
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:23,031
I think she's doing the twist.

915
00:33:23,031 --> 00:33:24,132
- What's wrong with her body? - Isn't she good?

916
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,461
Her bottom protrudes too much.

917
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:27,372
(Here come the shakes.)

918
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:29,741
Your shoulders look weird.

919
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,271
She's so fast.

920
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:33,471
(My partner is so charming.)

921
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:34,471
You did so well.

922
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:36,612
She was terrific.

923
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,741
She's so cute.

924
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:40,882
She was.

925
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,751
That was hilarious.

926
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,451
Now, let's see Turbo's "Black Cat".

927
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:47,692
(The finale should be a Turbo's song.)

928
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,162
(He may look timid, but he's known for his shocking performances.)

929
00:33:52,192 --> 00:33:54,592
("Black Cat" by Turbo)

930
00:33:55,662 --> 00:33:59,832
(He is a living fossil who debuted 23 years ago under the name Turbo.)

931
00:34:00,602 --> 00:34:02,902
(Today, we would like to see his performance once again.)

932
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,142
Turbo, Turbo.

933
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,241
- Turbo, Turbo. - Turbo, Turbo.

934
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,411
- Turbo, Turbo. - Come on.

935
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,842
- I can't do it! - Let's go!

936
00:34:12,612 --> 00:34:15,081
("Black Cat" starts playing.)

937
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,822
(His backup dancers are all ready.)

938
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:20,391
- Here he comes. - Here he comes.

939
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,092
Darn it!

940
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:23,222
Gosh!

941
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,391
(The tiger has awoken.)

942
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:25,492
- Let's go! - Let's do it!

943
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:26,961
(Anticipating)

944
00:34:27,362 --> 00:34:29,132
(It's been so long since he's danced to it.)

945
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,632
(Here comes the cat.)

946
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,532
(For a moment, everyone forgot...)

947
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:36,402
(that he was once a part of a legendary group called Turbo.)

948
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:39,072
(The kittens are also busy dancing.)

949
00:34:39,672 --> 00:34:40,942
(An uninvited dancer appears.)

950
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:43,041
Do the popping dance. Great.

951
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:46,012
(Go away, Jae Seok. The real popping man is here.)

952
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,351
(He mimics Jung Nam perfectly.)

953
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:50,681
(Even Jong Kook approves.)

954
00:34:50,681 --> 00:34:52,222
Chi Yeul is so good!

955
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:53,992
(This is the whining bit.)

956
00:34:54,952 --> 00:34:56,391
- He's like Michael Jackson. - He is.

957
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,592
Let's go.

958
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,891
(It's Jong Kook's part again.)

959
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,431
(He acts unbelievably cute.)

960
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:08,902
(The kittens are all having fun.)

961
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:11,371
(Now comes the highlight.)

962
00:35:11,371 --> 00:35:13,242
- To your right. - Let's go.

963
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,311
(Let's do this together.)

964
00:35:15,271 --> 00:35:16,282
Let's go!

965
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,711
(We are all...)

966
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:20,652
(the black cat, Nero.)

967
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,882
(All of them dance as one.)

968
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:27,722
(It's exactly like back in 1995.)

969
00:35:27,722 --> 00:35:31,621
(Back then, everyone was a black cat.)

970
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:33,461
(Acting cute)

971
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:35,661
(Reminiscing)

972
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:39,202
(We're all united under the name Turbo.)

973
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:41,702
(Jong Kook feels embarrassed.)

974
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:43,942
That was fun.

975
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,172
(They're still excited.)

976
00:35:45,172 --> 00:35:46,942
- That's a great song. - It's been a while.

977
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:49,842
It feels like we're time traveling.

978
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:51,012
Excuse me. This isn't a club.

979
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:53,112
- You can't throw away bottles. - I'm sorry.

980
00:35:53,882 --> 00:35:55,822
(There are piles of empty bottles.)

981
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:57,222
- I mean... - We'll pick them up.

982
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:58,952
- What are you doing? - I was having too much fun.

983
00:35:58,952 --> 00:36:01,192
- I'm sorry. - You shouldn't do this.

984
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,661
- This isn't a club. - Sorry, I wasn't aware.

985
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,061
It's quite heartwarming today.

986
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:06,592
- It really is. - It is.

987
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,291
It's Christmas.

988
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,101
The winner should be...

989
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:13,331
If we're judging by the teams, it's Jong Kook and Soo Young.

990
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,271
- Me too. - Me too.

991
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,402
That's right.

992
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:17,942
- She did well. - Jong Kook and Soo Young win.

993
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,242
(Jong Kook and Soo Young win.)

994
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:22,311
To Kwang Soo's team...

995
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:23,882
and Jong Kook's team,

996
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,711
I'll give you each a hint.

997
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:27,152
(Each of them are given a hint.)

998
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,481
You're free to share the hints,

999
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:30,251
- but it's probably better not to. - Oh, really?

1000
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,291
- Are we given the same hints? - Yes.

1001
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,762
What does this secret have to do with Seok Jin?

1002
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:38,961
- Do you really not know? - I don't.

1003
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:41,592
- I have no idea. - He's suspicious.

1004
00:36:41,592 --> 00:36:42,802
(Kwang Soo receives a hint about himself.)

1005
00:36:42,802 --> 00:36:44,001
Do you get it?

1006
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,001
Honestly, I have no idea...

1007
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:47,331
- what this means. - Wait.

1008
00:36:47,402 --> 00:36:49,141
Is this what I think it is?

1009
00:36:49,271 --> 00:36:50,472
Share the hint.

1010
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:51,742
(What is the hint?)

1011
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:54,371
- We got the same hint, right? - Yes.

1012
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:57,612
(Jee Seok Jin is a Furious Santa.)

1013
00:36:57,612 --> 00:36:58,782
Tell us.

1014
00:36:59,152 --> 00:37:00,652
(I think we're in danger, Seok Jin.)

1015
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,382
Now, we'll be heading to the restaurants.

1016
00:37:03,452 --> 00:37:04,922
Let's go.

1017
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,922
(Korean cuisine, Chinese cuisine)

1018
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,791
What is the hint?

1019
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,822
The thing is,

1020
00:37:09,822 --> 00:37:11,822
- we're lacking hints. - I know.

1021
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:14,831
- So I'm lost about Seok Jin. - How am I related?

1022
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:17,132
Does he really not know, or is he just pretending?

1023
00:37:17,132 --> 00:37:19,172
- I have no idea. - I think he's telling the truth.

1024
00:37:19,172 --> 00:37:20,302
- I'm serious. - Really?

1025
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:23,041
- Aren't you blushing? - I'm not.

1026
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:24,702
I have no idea.

1027
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,942
It's the truth.

1028
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:28,541
For another hint,

1029
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:30,811
- we'll begin our second mission. - Good.

1030
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:32,211
The second mission is called...

1031
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:33,811
Random 5-minute Talk.

1032
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:34,911
- 5-minute talk? - What is that?

1033
00:37:34,911 --> 00:37:36,081
You know this game.

1034
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:37,952
The question will be related to your partner.

1035
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:39,391
If you can give three answers...

1036
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:42,492
- in five seconds, you pass. - Oh, no.

1037
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,322
- It just needs to make sense. - Yes.

1038
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,592
The answers aren't from our hearts.

1039
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:47,791
- It doesn't matter. - It's just a game.

1040
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:48,961
- Don't take it to heart. - Okay.

1041
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:51,132
The first question is for Hye Bin.

1042
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,572
- Is it about me? - Correct.

1043
00:37:54,132 --> 00:37:55,802
- I'll start. - Here we go.

1044
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:58,541
What are some things you wish he wouldn't do?

1045
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,711
(Things she wishes Seok Jin wouldn't do)

1046
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,242
Picking his nose, looking at me pervertedly,

1047
00:38:03,311 --> 00:38:04,641
and being...

1048
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:07,012
Picking his nose, looking at me pervertedly,

1049
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,711
and being...

1050
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:11,282
When did I look at you like a pervert?

1051
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,822
Aren't you being too sincere?

1052
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:14,851
- Hey. - No, I'm not.

1053
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:16,422
I didn't mean any of them.

1054
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:17,961
- I'm serious. - He was a pervert?

1055
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:18,992
Back then...

1056
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,061
Hey.

1057
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:22,802
I only looked at you twice today.

1058
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:23,931
(We're practically strangers.)

1059
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:28,302
(When you were dancing as the 24-hour Spinner,)

1060
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:31,402
(that was when I was looking at you.)

1061
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:32,771
I've never looked at her like that.

1062
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:34,541
I don't usually observe people.

1063
00:38:34,942 --> 00:38:36,782
She was being so detailed.

1064
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,742
- Goodness. - They'll have a wrong impression.

1065
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:40,112
Hye Bin...

1066
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,012
- Seok Jin. - It's the second question.

1067
00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:43,552
- It's the second question. - Is it about her?

1068
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:45,521
I know everything about her.

1069
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:48,092
What were you thinking of when you saw her dancing?

1070
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,222
(His thoughts when she was dancing)

1071
00:38:50,222 --> 00:38:52,862
Gosh, she's so sexy.

1072
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:54,391
(She's so sexy.)

1073
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:56,231
It's very sensual.

1074
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:58,302
(She was sexy and sensual.)

1075
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:02,501
What was the "gosh" for? You could've omitted that part out.

1076
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,501
He thoroughly meant it which makes it...

1077
00:39:04,501 --> 00:39:06,371
- even more disgusting. - Goodness.

1078
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,211
That was too much.

1079
00:39:08,311 --> 00:39:10,382
I had no idea he was like this.

1080
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,382
It's been a while since I've heard such a disgusting remark.

1081
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,581
Is it really that hard to answer this?

1082
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:16,981
Striking, sexy, amazing.

1083
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:18,081
Mind your own business.

1084
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:19,492
Stay out of this.

1085
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,621
(This game has only made him upset.)

1086
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,052
- Mind your own business. - Moving on.

1087
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,891
It's Chi Yeul's turn.

1088
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,891
When do you fall in love with So Min?

1089
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:30,331
(When do you fall in love with So Min?)

1090
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,902
When I first saw her, when she changed her hat.

1091
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,001
and when she smiled at me.

1092
00:39:33,001 --> 00:39:35,902
(Their first encounter, when switching hats, when she smiles)

1093
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,902
What was that?

1094
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:42,041
- It's only a game. - I'm so happy.

1095
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:44,612
(Wake up. It's only a game.)

1096
00:39:44,612 --> 00:39:46,552
How did he notice that I switched hats?

1097
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:48,452
Goodness.

1098
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:50,222
She was wearing a red one before.

1099
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:51,621
Goodness.

1100
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:52,692
It's So Min's turn.

1101
00:39:52,692 --> 00:39:54,391
- You passed. - I did.

1102
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:56,222
- We can get a hint. - All right.

1103
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,661
Here's the question.

1104
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,961
What are Chi Yeul's charms?

1105
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:01,862
(Chi Yeul's charms)

1106
00:40:01,862 --> 00:40:03,202
Nose, eyes, and when he sings.

1107
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:05,601
(Nose, eyes, and when he sings)

1108
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:07,231
(Incorrect)

1109
00:40:07,831 --> 00:40:08,931
Why?

1110
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:11,742
- Why? - Why?

1111
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,141
Nose, eyes, and when I sing.

1112
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:14,711
I didn't feel the sincerity.

1113
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,242
- I couldn't feel it. - Honestly,

1114
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:18,112
- I could see that. - Right?

1115
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:20,382
(Haha is also a judge.)

1116
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:22,512
So Min, you do admit to it, right?

1117
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:23,681
It wasn't sincere.

1118
00:40:23,952 --> 00:40:25,021
It's such a disappointment.

1119
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:27,851
(She plays along half-heartedly.)

1120
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:28,891
(She's caught.)

1121
00:40:28,891 --> 00:40:30,891
See? I knew it.

1122
00:40:30,891 --> 00:40:33,231
- It's not true. - I caught her.

1123
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,532
- I did. - No, no.

1124
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,402
Right? You admitted to it.

1125
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,632
This is great. Okay.

1126
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,132
Kwang Soo's turn.

1127
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:42,331
- You need to do well. - It'll be about Ha Na.

1128
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:44,541
What was your first impression of her?

1129
00:40:45,001 --> 00:40:46,672
She's sexy, cute, and dainty.

1130
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:48,811
(Is it the truth? He replies very easily.)

1131
00:40:49,382 --> 00:40:51,811
What are some things you wish she'd change in 2019?

1132
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,081
Her boyfriend. No...

1133
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,981
What are some things you wish she'd change in 2019?

1134
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,652
(He mentions about her boyfriend.)

1135
00:40:57,652 --> 00:40:59,021
I'm sorry.

1136
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,621
- No, no. - Her boyfriend?

1137
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:01,722
That was a mistake.

1138
00:41:01,722 --> 00:41:02,961
Why would she change her boyfriend?

1139
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:04,291
Okay, okay.

1140
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:07,661
All right, then. Next is Ji Hyo.

1141
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:09,561
Be honest. We have nothing going on.

1142
00:41:09,561 --> 00:41:11,362
- You're right. - You can swear too.

1143
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,501
What are some advantages of being a team with Se Chan?

1144
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,202
I can eat, poop, and play well.

1145
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:16,802
I can eat, poop, and play well.

1146
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:17,942
That's great.

1147
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,942
- That was straightforward. - It was.

1148
00:41:19,942 --> 00:41:22,072
Some aspects where Se Chan is better off than Haha.

1149
00:41:22,172 --> 00:41:23,811
He is more handsome, cuter, and more dainty.

1150
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:25,512
Okay! Come on!

1151
00:41:25,512 --> 00:41:27,552
What are some parts of him that you'd like to have?

1152
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:29,722
Eyes, nose, and lips.

1153
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:35,092
- She did well. - She did.

1154
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:36,192
That was good.

1155
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,661
Ji Hyo, that was nice and clean.

1156
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:42,262
I'm far better off than Haha.

1157
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:43,661
You're cute and dainty.

1158
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:44,731
(He's cuter and more dainty.)

1159
00:41:44,731 --> 00:41:46,601
That's great. All right.

1160
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:47,802
That was clean.

1161
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:48,831
(Since you said you wanted to be like him...)

1162
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:51,342
- Okay. - This is a good thing.

1163
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,342
If they get a hint, then we'll all get two hints.

1164
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:55,842
(If Se Chan and Ji Hyo share their hint, it'll be for the best.)

1165
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:59,552
Goodness. This one's a pretty big one.

1166
00:41:59,552 --> 00:42:00,811
- What is it? - Tell us.

1167
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:02,481
(What is the hint?)

1168
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:05,222
(Two of the guests are assistants.)

1169
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,751
Our hint is very straightforward.

1170
00:42:06,751 --> 00:42:07,851
(He tries to lure them.)

1171
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,961
Let's switch.

1172
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:11,061
I'll do it.

1173
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:12,161
If you want, I'll do it.

1174
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,762
- I'll show you ours. - What if...

1175
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:15,231
- their hint isn't that great? - Last time...

1176
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:17,762
(The three couples decide to share hints.)

1177
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:18,862
What?

1178
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,871
"Two of the guests are assistants."

1179
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,271
(The guests are startled by this new hint.)

1180
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:25,771
What's shocking is that the hint said "two of the guests".

1181
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,271
The fact that it said that means...

1182
00:42:28,271 --> 00:42:31,311
that two of the members may be spies.

1183
00:42:31,311 --> 00:42:32,981
(Could there be two spies?)

1184
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:34,911
(Is there another spy other than Seok Jin?)

1185
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:36,282
"Two of the guests"...

1186
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:38,181
could mean some of the members may be on their team.

1187
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,751
This is just my guess.

1188
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:42,652
(Kwang Soo is agitated.)

1189
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,621
Some of the members may be on their team.

1190
00:42:45,621 --> 00:42:47,692
- This is just my guess. - I feel the same way.

1191
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:49,931
Wouldn't there be too many spies then?

1192
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:52,972
That's a huge hint.

1193
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:56,342
(Stuttering)

1194
00:42:56,342 --> 00:42:57,802
Are you flustered?

1195
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:03,612
(You must be since you're one of the assistants.)

1196
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:05,981
I think my face is getting red.

1197
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:08,411
If you deceive us again, I'll be so shocked.

1198
00:43:08,512 --> 00:43:10,851
- I think... - She wouldn't.

1199
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:12,891
- Not again. - Come on.

1200
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:14,351
But that hint is so weird.

1201
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:16,121
Jong Kook, there's something you need to know.

1202
00:43:16,121 --> 00:43:18,161
We're cornering Soo Young as one of the assistants,

1203
00:43:18,161 --> 00:43:20,931
but we need to also think about Ha Na who's been quiet all along.

1204
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,291
(Ha Na is suspicious.)

1205
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,402
She hasn't said a word.

1206
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,461
I'm not the talkative type to begin with.

1207
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,001
- All of a sudden? - What do you mean?

1208
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:30,972
- You were chatty with Sung Hoon. - You were.

1209
00:43:30,972 --> 00:43:31,972
I'm quite timid.

1210
00:43:31,972 --> 00:43:35,442
After hearing that hint, you've stopped talking.

1211
00:43:36,141 --> 00:43:38,282
I think some of the members are suspicious too.

1212
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,751
- I think so. - Right?

1213
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,411
- I'm positive. - Among the people here,

1214
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:43,922
these two are worth our suspicions.

1215
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,652
Oh, come on, now.

1216
00:43:45,652 --> 00:43:50,291
(Is one of them an assistant?)

1217
00:43:50,291 --> 00:43:52,161
I smell something delicious.

1218
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:53,592
What is it?

1219
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:54,661
It's Korean cuisine.

1220
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:57,762
For this round, you'll be rewarded a hint and a meal.

1221
00:43:57,862 --> 00:44:00,202
The game is Three Syllable Game.

1222
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:01,532
(Three Syllable Game)

1223
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:02,572
(All right.)

1224
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:03,672
Let's do it.

1225
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:07,371
The director will say the first one, and you will finish it.

1226
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:09,342
You succeed once you make a three-syllable word.

1227
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:11,181
The category will be random.

1228
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,012
Who will go first?

1229
00:44:13,711 --> 00:44:15,711
- I'd like Ji Hyo to go first. - Me too.

1230
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:16,722
(Anyone but me.)

1231
00:44:16,722 --> 00:44:17,782
Go, Ji Hyo.

1232
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:19,351
You did well during the last game.

1233
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:20,391
- Right. - Okay.

1234
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,452
I'll go.

1235
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:22,992
- I'll start. - There's no category, right?

1236
00:44:22,992 --> 00:44:24,061
Correct.

1237
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,021
- As long as it makes sense? - Right.

1238
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:27,192
- Okay. - All right.

1239
00:44:27,192 --> 00:44:28,762
We'll each say a syllable.

1240
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:30,001
(The game begins.)

1241
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,831
- Jung. - Nan.

1242
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:33,501
(What?)

1243
00:44:33,501 --> 00:44:34,802
- Gook? - Incorrect.

1244
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:36,242
(What?)

1245
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,141
(Ji Hyo didn't give Se Chan much chance.)

1246
00:44:39,141 --> 00:44:40,242
Jung Nan?

1247
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,541
Who is he?

1248
00:44:41,541 --> 00:44:43,612
- Who is Jung Nan? - Who is he?

1249
00:44:43,612 --> 00:44:45,481
- What were you talking about? - What was that?

1250
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,282
- Was it pickled pollack tripe? - That's right.

1251
00:44:47,282 --> 00:44:48,282
- Pickled pollack tripe? - Jung...

1252
00:44:48,282 --> 00:44:49,981
Jung Nan Jung.

1253
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:52,621
- What is that? - It's a person.

1254
00:44:53,222 --> 00:44:55,251
- Who is that? - Oh, I know.

1255
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:56,592
She was a historical figure.

1256
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:59,061
Hold on. Were you talking about a historical figure?

1257
00:44:59,061 --> 00:45:01,132
Did you expect me to actually get it right?

1258
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,132
I'm sorry.

1259
00:45:03,132 --> 00:45:05,762
Do you know Jung Nan Jung well?

1260
00:45:05,762 --> 00:45:07,831
- Honestly? No. - Come on, Ji Hyo.

1261
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:10,672
- I don't know that well. - She's more laidback now.

1262
00:45:10,672 --> 00:45:11,871
She changed.

1263
00:45:11,871 --> 00:45:14,112
We're talking about "Ladies of the Palace".

1264
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:15,612
(She is from an older generation.)

1265
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,742
The good, old days.

1266
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:17,782
- I'll start now. - Okay.

1267
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:18,842
Jung.

1268
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:22,581
(It's the same syllable once again.)

1269
00:45:22,581 --> 00:45:23,722
Nan.

1270
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:24,882
(He repeats the same syllable.)

1271
00:45:26,152 --> 00:45:27,791
(Jung Nan Jung appears once again.)

1272
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,092
Goodness.

1273
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:31,992
No one here knows who Jung Nan Jung is.

1274
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:33,192
No one knows.

1275
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:34,532
Jung Nan Jung.

1276
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,831
- Who is she? - Who could she be?

1277
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:37,561
- Jung Nan Jung. - I'd like to google her.

1278
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:40,331
- I don't know her. - We can't get past her.

1279
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:41,402
Ha Na will go.

1280
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:42,431
- It's her turn? - I'll start.

1281
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:43,572
Let's concentrate.

1282
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:46,771
- It's easier than you think. - Okay.

1283
00:45:46,771 --> 00:45:47,972
Tell yourself that you can do it.

1284
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:49,942
- I can do it. - Okay.

1285
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:51,242
Do it in one go.

1286
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,012
All right, then.

1287
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:54,481
"Sah".

1288
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,222
(What was that?)

1289
00:45:57,722 --> 00:45:58,822
Wait.

1290
00:45:59,552 --> 00:46:00,891
- Hey. - Come on.

1291
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,422
So Hyun.

1292
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:05,161
Hold on.

1293
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:06,661
- What was that? - Come on.

1294
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:07,791
Hey.

1295
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:09,431
Hey, I'll talk to her.

1296
00:46:09,431 --> 00:46:11,302
Was that an apostrophe S?

1297
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,302
(Calm down.)

1298
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,731
(Was there an apostrophe?)

1299
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,001
What was that?

1300
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:18,101
Was that an S or an A?

1301
00:46:18,472 --> 00:46:20,612
- Which one was it? - I think it was an A.

1302
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,672
- It was an A. - An A?

1303
00:46:21,672 --> 00:46:23,681
If you're going to be this cheap, I'll just give up and not eat.

1304
00:46:23,681 --> 00:46:24,782
(I'll give up.)

1305
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:25,942
(Laughing)

1306
00:46:25,942 --> 00:46:28,081
She's not being fair.

1307
00:46:28,981 --> 00:46:30,521
- I'll start. - Go.

1308
00:46:30,722 --> 00:46:31,782
- We can do it. - All right.

1309
00:46:31,782 --> 00:46:33,422
- Stan. - Dard.

1310
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:36,762
(Standard)

1311
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:37,762
Language.

1312
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:40,762
(Standard language)

1313
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,291
They did it.

1314
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:44,231
(What a surprise.)

1315
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:45,661
You've succeeded.

1316
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:47,001
(They finally succeed.)

1317
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:50,302
I'll give the hint to Kwang Soo and Ha Na.

1318
00:46:50,302 --> 00:46:51,501
Justice will prevail.

1319
00:46:51,501 --> 00:46:53,572
(They receive a hint.)

1320
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,672
Can we just eat?

1321
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:56,742
Please.

1322
00:46:56,742 --> 00:46:58,911
As always, you won't be eating for free.

1323
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:02,012
If you win, you'll be rewarded a hint and a meal.

1324
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:03,851
Let's get a hint.

1325
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,181
- Please, let's do that. - All right.

1326
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:07,952
- Let's do this. - All right.

1327
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,121
It's called Goldfish Game.

1328
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,492
- What? - What is that?

1329
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:15,291
Write what the opposing female member says and does the most...

1330
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:16,802
on her headband.

1331
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,362
If she says or does those things, she fails.

1332
00:47:18,362 --> 00:47:20,931
If she mentions the word or does the action,

1333
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,101
we will draw on her partner's face.

1334
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,402
Come on.

1335
00:47:24,672 --> 00:47:27,242
The team with the fewest punishments...

1336
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,842
will receive a hint and a meal.

1337
00:47:29,842 --> 00:47:30,911
Okay.

1338
00:47:31,442 --> 00:47:33,981
- So I'll have to write about her? - This'll be fun.

1339
00:47:34,311 --> 00:47:36,012
- Right. - Like this?

1340
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:38,081
- You can't read them aloud. - Of course.

1341
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:39,481
- It's Seon Hwa for us. - All right.

1342
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,891
What can we write?

1343
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:42,822
The male member's face will get drawn on?

1344
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:44,262
Let's see.

1345
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,561
(Whispering)

1346
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:52,362
(What did they write?)

1347
00:47:52,362 --> 00:47:54,331
That was good.

1348
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:55,331
(What did they write?)

1349
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,572
Are you done? Ladies, please close your eyes.

1350
00:47:59,371 --> 00:48:01,442
We'll put the headband on you.

1351
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,811
(Chi Yeul and So Min)

1352
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:06,282
("No" and touching Chi Yeul)

1353
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:09,181
(Jae Seok and Seon Hwa)

1354
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,481
("No" and touching her hair)

1355
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,952
(Haha is the female member.)

1356
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:18,922
("What?" and shaking his legs)

1357
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:22,132
(Seok Jin and Hye Bin)

1358
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:24,501
(Saying the male members' names and showing her gums when smiling)

1359
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,702
What is it?

1360
00:48:26,132 --> 00:48:27,132
- What are they? - It's...

1361
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:28,331
There's a mirror. Be careful.

1362
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:29,871
(Sung Hoon looks at Haha's words.)

1363
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,771
(Sighing)

1364
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,641
(We made the right choice.)

1365
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:38,882
Are mine difficult?

1366
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,911
(Don't make me nervous.)

1367
00:48:40,112 --> 00:48:41,452
Are mine too easy?

1368
00:48:41,452 --> 00:48:43,282
Gosh, we're doomed.

1369
00:48:44,652 --> 00:48:45,681
We're doomed?

1370
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:47,492
(Shaking)

1371
00:48:48,351 --> 00:48:49,552
- We're doomed? - You can't tell him.

1372
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:50,692
You can't.

1373
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,021
What is it?

1374
00:48:52,021 --> 00:48:53,021
(Everyone needs to talk.)

1375
00:48:53,021 --> 00:48:55,362
We'll start our 10-minute talk now.

1376
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,862
How was this year?

1377
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,501
Hye Bin?

1378
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:00,572
(He asks Hye Bin.)

1379
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:02,831
(Me?)

1380
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:07,072
In the beginning, I wasn't that busy.

1381
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:09,141
Now that it's the yearend...

1382
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:12,742
and now that I've aged...

1383
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,081
You're being too cautious.

1384
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:16,351
(You're thinking a lot before speaking.)

1385
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:18,351
(Smiling)

1386
00:49:18,351 --> 00:49:19,521
- You're being too cautious. - Well...

1387
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,222
I felt like I should work hard.

1388
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:25,362
- Please draw on Seok Jin. - Did I do something?

1389
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,891
- Please draw on him. - Really?

1390
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:28,231
- On Seok Jin. - Did I do something?

1391
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:29,931
I like it.

1392
00:49:29,931 --> 00:49:30,931
(A fellow member draws on him.)

1393
00:49:30,931 --> 00:49:32,902
(Drawing)

1394
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,871
(Lip botox)

1395
00:49:37,672 --> 00:49:39,371
- It's pretty. - It suits you.

1396
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,112
It looks natural.

1397
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,172
All right.

1398
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:46,411
Anyway, 2018 was a nice year.

1399
00:49:46,411 --> 00:49:48,181
I look forward to next year.

1400
00:49:48,181 --> 00:49:50,782
Watching So Min,

1401
00:49:50,782 --> 00:49:54,891
I feel like she made quite an impact this year.

1402
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,422
Is that true?

1403
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:58,621
- Is that true? - It's not entirely true.

1404
00:49:59,492 --> 00:50:00,762
You made a lot of money, right?

1405
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:02,291
(Well...)

1406
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:04,461
(Please, So Min.)

1407
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:06,032
(She stops herself.)

1408
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:07,972
Why isn't she talking?

1409
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:09,572
Please talk.

1410
00:50:09,942 --> 00:50:11,172
Perhaps, so.

1411
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:14,112
(That was a successful defense.)

1412
00:50:14,172 --> 00:50:19,512
Seon Hwa, are you currently seeing anyone?

1413
00:50:21,512 --> 00:50:23,552
There are times when I am and also times when I'm not.

1414
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:25,882
It comes and goes.

1415
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:27,192
Do you have a boyfriend?

1416
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,791
(Seok Jin attacks.)

1417
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,222
(Standing upright, she just smiles.)

1418
00:50:31,222 --> 00:50:34,092
I think she's standing upright against something imaginary.

1419
00:50:34,391 --> 00:50:37,702
She didn't have to turn awkwardly like this.

1420
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,461
(She's being very cautious.)

1421
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:41,501
Do you have a younger brother?

1422
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,802
A younger brother...

1423
00:50:44,101 --> 00:50:45,371
is existent.

1424
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,742
(A younger brother...)

1425
00:50:47,742 --> 00:50:49,342
(is existent.)

1426
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:51,211
- Are you a robot? - Are you, Seon Hwa?

1427
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:53,351
(So Min's attack fails. Seon Hwa successfully defends.)

1428
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:55,452
- "Younger brother". - Are you a robot?

1429
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,382
By the way, Hye Bin.

1430
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:01,291
I think you said something that you'll regret...

1431
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,021
to Seok Jin.

1432
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,161
You practically called him a pervert.

1433
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:07,262
It must've hurt him.

1434
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:09,891
You should send him a video message.

1435
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:11,731
(Send him a video message.)

1436
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:13,101
It'll be meaningful.

1437
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,101
- I know he's next to you. - A video message?

1438
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:17,541
I think you should draw your lips on an everyday basis.

1439
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:19,271
How are my lips?

1440
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,771
(Thanks to Jae Seok's sudden attack,)

1441
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:23,072
(she shows her gums again.)

1442
00:51:23,072 --> 00:51:24,981
You have a strong look.

1443
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:26,882
Please draw on Seok Jin's face.

1444
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:29,112
Gosh, they're too good.

1445
00:51:29,112 --> 00:51:30,422
(Come on!)

1446
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:31,822
(What did I do?)

1447
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,152
They're all so good.

1448
00:51:33,251 --> 00:51:34,521
Hye Bin, please.

1449
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,362
What? It was because of something I did?

1450
00:51:37,592 --> 00:51:39,791
I'm getting penalized because of you.

1451
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,692
What did I do?

1452
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,532
You're focusing on his lips.

1453
00:51:44,731 --> 00:51:46,302
The colors are pretty.

1454
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:47,672
Is it getting bigger?

1455
00:51:47,672 --> 00:51:49,501
He contoured your lips.

1456
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:52,802
Anyway, send him a video message.

1457
00:51:53,072 --> 00:51:54,472
He needs closure.

1458
00:51:55,342 --> 00:51:56,711
To Seok Jin.

1459
00:51:56,711 --> 00:52:00,452
(She said his name.)

1460
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:02,612
I don't think we'll get another hint.

1461
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:04,851
You've become disheartened.

1462
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:06,722
He's sad.

1463
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:09,391
(Laughing)

1464
00:52:10,092 --> 00:52:11,592
How do I look?

1465
00:52:11,592 --> 00:52:12,722
Seok Jin.

1466
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:14,291
- We're filming right now. - Do I look sad?

1467
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:15,931
You should be happy.

1468
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:17,561
I am. I really am.

1469
00:52:17,561 --> 00:52:18,762
(He looks sad.)

1470
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:21,231
I have a question.

1471
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:23,072
How do you feel about Chi Yeul?

1472
00:52:23,572 --> 00:52:25,972
When we were playing that game earlier...

1473
00:52:25,972 --> 00:52:28,371
- Were you nervous? - You know, So Min is...

1474
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,481
very honest.

1475
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,442
Please draw on Jae Seok's face.

1476
00:52:32,641 --> 00:52:34,382
- On my face? - Correct.

1477
00:52:34,382 --> 00:52:35,411
Seon Hwa did something.

1478
00:52:35,411 --> 00:52:38,322
(While Hye Bin was talking to So Min,)

1479
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,722
(Seon Hwa touched her hair.)

1480
00:52:40,722 --> 00:52:42,251
("No" and touching Chi Yeul)

1481
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:44,661
(Jae Seok is being penalized.)

1482
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,192
(Stamping and clapping)

1483
00:52:46,192 --> 00:52:48,331
(Stamping and clapping)

1484
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,362
(This melody and beat sounds familiar.)

1485
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:55,172
("We Will Rock You" by Queen means...)

1486
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,802
(Freddie Mercury is here.)

1487
00:52:58,802 --> 00:52:59,902
That was nice.

1488
00:52:59,902 --> 00:53:01,811
(All he needed was a simple mustache...)

1489
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,911
(to look like him.)

1490
00:53:04,005 --> 00:53:08,005
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E432 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"Furious Santas’ Secret Mission"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1491
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:10,751
(His charisma captivates the audience.)

1492
00:53:10,751 --> 00:53:13,021
(Jae Seok does a perfect impression of him.)

1493
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:16,092
(Freddie Mercury)

1494
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:19,422
Can you do this?

1495
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:23,501
(Singing)

1496
00:53:23,501 --> 00:53:26,661
(Jae Seok becomes excited with a mustache.)

1497
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:29,402
(He's not sad.)

1498
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:32,101
Good. We're getting attacked.

1499
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:34,572
I think we should get started.

1500
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,211
- Go the opposite way. - Let's do that.

1501
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:37,282
Okay, the opposite way.

1502
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:39,311
Guys will put on the headbands, and ladies will get the punishment.

1503
00:53:39,311 --> 00:53:41,181
- All right. - It's this direction.

1504
00:53:41,181 --> 00:53:42,282
I'm doing Jae Seok's.

1505
00:53:42,282 --> 00:53:43,382
Are we doing Chi Yeul's?

1506
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:45,822
Yes, Chi Yeul writes Seok Jin's.

1507
00:53:46,322 --> 00:53:47,822
(This is the aftereffect of impersonating Freddie Mercury.)

1508
00:53:47,822 --> 00:53:49,791
I think he really likes it.

1509
00:53:50,052 --> 00:53:51,992
I want to put this on him.

1510
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:52,992
Me too.

1511
00:53:52,992 --> 00:53:56,391
We're the likely winners of this game. We're so good.

1512
00:53:56,391 --> 00:53:58,231
No, maybe not.

1513
00:53:58,302 --> 00:53:59,561
Maybe they'll feel bad.

1514
00:53:59,931 --> 00:54:01,402
This is driving me nuts.

1515
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:04,101
Guys, close your eyes and please put it on them.

1516
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:05,101
(The ladies put on the headbands for the guys.)

1517
00:54:05,902 --> 00:54:09,311
(Seok Jin can't impersonate Freddie Mercury and cannot touch his nose.)

1518
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:13,311
(Seok Jin can't impersonate Freddie Mercury and cannot clap.)

1519
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:16,581
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok's forbidden words are the same.)

1520
00:54:17,382 --> 00:54:19,081
That's good.

1521
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:22,092
(Chi Yeul's forbidden word is "I", and he cannot cross his legs.)

1522
00:54:22,391 --> 00:54:27,592
(Sung Hoon can't speak English and he cannot look at Haha.)

1523
00:54:27,862 --> 00:54:30,132
Can you go around...

1524
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:32,802
You have to be careful.

1525
00:54:33,001 --> 00:54:34,771
- You can't be the same person. - Is that how I have to think?

1526
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,072
- You have to become someone else. - Okay, got it.

1527
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:38,501
I'm in trouble.

1528
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:39,572
(He's also in trouble.)

1529
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:42,112
- I'm in trouble. - What is it?

1530
00:54:42,672 --> 00:54:44,481
Don't do anything.

1531
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,351
Okay, the topic is New Year's resolutions.

1532
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,581
New Year's resolutions?

1533
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:52,351
Start.

1534
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,052
I think we concluded 2018 well.

1535
00:54:56,052 --> 00:54:58,762
2019 is about to begin.

1536
00:54:59,391 --> 00:55:00,391
Sure.

1537
00:55:00,692 --> 00:55:01,931
(He fixes his gaze on Haha.)

1538
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,702
(Fail)

1539
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:07,101
(They failed already.)

1540
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:08,731
He was talking, and they failed.

1541
00:55:09,302 --> 00:55:11,101
(He gets the punishment as soon as they start.)

1542
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,041
This will be tough.

1543
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:15,472
It's not like I can stay silent. This is driving me nuts.

1544
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:20,981
What is it? Why? I wasn't doing anything at all.

1545
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:22,452
(Sung Hoon will be the center of this round.)

1546
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,481
- Those are sunglasses. - It suits him.

1547
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:25,851
Sunglasses.

1548
00:55:25,851 --> 00:55:27,391
- I'll continue. - Okay.

1549
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:30,092
Great work in 2018.

1550
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:33,592
(Great work in 2018!)

1551
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:35,061
(Clapping)

1552
00:55:36,192 --> 00:55:37,561
(Clap, clap)

1553
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:39,302
(Fail)

1554
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,972
Jae Seok.

1555
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:42,302
Jae Seok.

1556
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:43,472
(Did I do something wrong?)

1557
00:55:44,001 --> 00:55:45,972
You guys will be matching.

1558
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:48,541
- They're a couple. - You should both do this.

1559
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,382
Do the Freddie Mercury thing once you're done.

1560
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,012
All right.

1561
00:55:53,012 --> 00:55:54,981
Haha did something wrong again.

1562
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:56,851
What?

1563
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,222
Haha did something wrong again.

1564
00:55:58,452 --> 00:55:59,981
What?

1565
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,391
It's you. What are you talking about?

1566
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,422
- Did I do something wrong? Why? - It's you.

1567
00:56:03,492 --> 00:56:04,661
Why are you laughing?

1568
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:07,231
Do it to Hye Bin. Do it to her.

1569
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,891
(He claps like a seal.)

1570
00:56:09,891 --> 00:56:11,831
(He gets punished again.)

1571
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:13,331
Who is it?

1572
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:14,331
- What? - Jae Seok.

1573
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,632
- Jae Seok did something wrong. - I got this for you.

1574
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:19,371
It's a habit.

1575
00:56:20,612 --> 00:56:22,112
(Hye Bin is done with the face painting.)

1576
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,172
She's so...

1577
00:56:23,172 --> 00:56:25,282
- You were being nice. - She's pretty.

1578
00:56:25,581 --> 00:56:27,851
- You were being too nice. - She's pretty.

1579
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:29,882
You two look great.

1580
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:31,922
(It's the Queen couple.)

1581
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:32,952
Right.

1582
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:35,121
(Celebrating)

1583
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:36,391
(Fail)

1584
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:38,222
Jae Seok.

1585
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:39,922
(Seon Hwa gets the punishment again.)

1586
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:41,992
- What's wrong? - Why?

1587
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:43,702
(He tries to prevent Jae Seok from figuring out the forbidden word.)

1588
00:56:43,702 --> 00:56:44,702
(Am I doing good, Haha?)

1589
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:46,831
- I've never seen her laugh so hard. - This is so funny.

1590
00:56:46,831 --> 00:56:48,172
More for Haha.

1591
00:56:53,342 --> 00:56:55,242
- You must like me. - This is good.

1592
00:56:55,371 --> 00:56:58,842
Chi Yeul is unbreakable.

1593
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:00,382
How do we...

1594
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:02,681
This is the first time I didn't get punished for face painting.

1595
00:57:03,081 --> 00:57:05,322
- Talk to us. - Okay.

1596
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:09,021
Do you have something to say...

1597
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,692
to 2018?

1598
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:13,192
(Goodness)

1599
00:57:13,192 --> 00:57:14,762
(Haha gets punished again.)

1600
00:57:14,762 --> 00:57:17,161
I can't stay quiet. This is driving me nuts.

1601
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:19,032
(He gets his face painted everywhere.)

1602
00:57:19,032 --> 00:57:20,572
This is incredible.

1603
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:24,472
(What?)

1604
00:57:24,871 --> 00:57:28,572
I got it.

1605
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:29,811
(Haha's face is already painted everywhere.)

1606
00:57:30,842 --> 00:57:32,811
There are no empty spaces on your face.

1607
00:57:33,382 --> 00:57:35,112
(It's a mess.)

1608
00:57:35,112 --> 00:57:37,521
Haha.

1609
00:57:37,681 --> 00:57:40,222
There's something here.

1610
00:57:40,222 --> 00:57:42,291
(She initiates an attack.)

1611
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:43,652
(Shaking)

1612
00:57:44,492 --> 00:57:46,061
(What's on his face?)

1613
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:47,961
(He stops turning his head.)

1614
00:57:47,961 --> 00:57:49,831
He knows one now.

1615
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:51,632
There's no more space for you.

1616
00:57:52,032 --> 00:57:53,661
This is so funny.

1617
00:57:53,661 --> 00:57:54,871
I'm happy.

1618
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,072
(Haha got all the face paintings.)

1619
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:57,172
Everybody.

1620
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,302
(I can't go down by myself.)

1621
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:03,012
(What?)

1622
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,041
(Seok Jin takes it.)

1623
00:58:06,742 --> 00:58:08,481
(Okay, he fell for it.)

1624
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:13,081
(Seok Jin and Hye Bin get punished again.)

1625
00:58:13,251 --> 00:58:14,751
I'll count down 10 seconds.

1626
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:16,192
Everybody, let's do a concert.

1627
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,692
(This is the final attack.)

1628
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:18,992
(Clapping)

1629
00:58:18,992 --> 00:58:21,692
(Jae Seok)

1630
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,862
This is so obvious.

1631
00:58:26,931 --> 00:58:29,202
(Stomping)

1632
00:58:29,202 --> 00:58:30,771
(He controls his excitement.)

1633
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:32,672
There's no time left.

1634
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:33,842
Come on.

1635
00:58:35,371 --> 00:58:37,041
(It's irresistible.)

1636
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:40,751
(Seok Jin can't help himself.)

1637
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:42,581
That startled me.

1638
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:43,952
Finally...

1639
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:45,322
(Finally!)

1640
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:46,552
So Min.

1641
00:58:46,822 --> 00:58:47,851
- Why? - Why?

1642
00:58:47,851 --> 00:58:49,791
(So Min gets the punishment right before the end of Round 2.)

1643
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:50,791
Why?

1644
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,322
(While So Min was attacking Seok Jin,)

1645
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:55,092
(Chi Yeul crossed his legs.)

1646
00:58:55,661 --> 00:58:58,431
It suits So Min very well.

1647
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,831
- Why does it suit you? - It suits you to do this.

1648
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:03,032
Here's the result.

1649
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:05,371
So Min and Chi Yeul are in first place.

1650
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,001
- I'm envious. - Yes!

1651
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,112
So Min and Chi Yeul get...

1652
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,282
a hint, and they'll get food.

1653
00:59:13,311 --> 00:59:14,382
You're the best.

1654
00:59:16,613 --> 00:59:18,042
The losers don't get anything.

1655
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:20,213
Why aren't you giving us anything?

1656
00:59:20,213 --> 00:59:22,553
There's nothing. Only the winners get it.

1657
00:59:22,553 --> 00:59:24,753
(What is the hint they received?)

1658
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,442
The losers don't get anything.

1659
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:29,613
Why aren't you giving us anything?

1660
00:59:29,613 --> 00:59:31,953
There's nothing. Only the winners get it.

1661
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:34,153
(What is the hint they received?)

1662
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:36,953
(Leave your shoes in the racket and valuables in the counter.)

1663
00:59:36,953 --> 00:59:38,422
(We're not responsible for lost items.)

1664
00:59:38,962 --> 00:59:40,792
- It's simple. - What's this?

1665
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:42,292
What do we do?

1666
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:48,701
Only 2 teams can eat. 1 team won't be able to.

1667
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,612
Only one team?

1668
00:59:50,612 --> 00:59:53,382
It's simple. We'll give you water.

1669
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:56,411
Open the lid and hit your water bottle.

1670
00:59:56,411 --> 00:59:58,482
If your water color changes, you win.

1671
00:59:58,752 --> 01:00:01,382
If there's no color, you won't be able to eat.

1672
01:00:01,382 --> 01:00:02,791
- Is this the luck of the draw? - Do we stay out of it?

1673
01:00:02,791 --> 01:00:04,021
Yes, you don't do it.

1674
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,192
- Let's eat. - Go at the same time.

1675
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:09,532
- In 1, 2, - Please.

1676
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:11,862
- Please. - three.

1677
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:12,962
Please!

1678
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:17,431
(Haha's team is in last place.)

1679
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:20,141
- All right! - All right.

1680
01:00:20,141 --> 01:00:22,141
Haha and Sung Hoon get...

1681
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:24,612
plain rice, seaweed, and soy sauce.

1682
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:26,882
Thank you for the food.

1683
01:00:26,882 --> 01:00:28,581
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1684
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,752
Can we eat that?

1685
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,052
(They're envious.)

1686
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:33,951
We don't have food, so we'll drink this.

1687
01:00:33,951 --> 01:00:36,752
(Let's drink this instead of eating food.)

1688
01:00:36,752 --> 01:00:37,951
(Gulping)

1689
01:00:37,951 --> 01:00:40,661
This is good. It's vitamin.

1690
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:42,161
We can drink this instead of soup.

1691
01:00:42,161 --> 01:00:44,862
(Let's replenish our vitamins and get the next hint.)

1692
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:49,632
(Meanwhile,)

1693
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:52,741
(Furious Santa Jee wasn't able to steal anything.)

1694
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:55,502
(Is Kwang Soo doing okay?)

1695
01:00:56,712 --> 01:00:59,612
(The other group is eating in a Korean restaurant.)

1696
01:01:00,041 --> 01:01:01,942
(He sneaks out.)

1697
01:01:02,752 --> 01:01:07,252
(Kwang Soo sneaks out during lunch.)

1698
01:01:07,252 --> 01:01:09,052
(Is nobody coming?)

1699
01:01:09,052 --> 01:01:11,152
(Sprinting)

1700
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:14,422
Where do I go?

1701
01:01:15,561 --> 01:01:17,462
(He looks around.)

1702
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:19,661
Their cars should be here.

1703
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,732
(He runs to the parking lot and finds the members' cars.)

1704
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:24,132
Excuse me.

1705
01:01:24,132 --> 01:01:26,302
(Why is he looking for their cars?)

1706
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:29,311
(This morning while receiving the hidden mission)

1707
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,641
(They must steal items that belong to the members and put it in a bag.)

1708
01:01:33,641 --> 01:01:37,782
(They'll be punished according to the number of items they fail.)

1709
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:39,882
Do you have Ji Hyo's hat?

1710
01:01:40,152 --> 01:01:41,351
- Her hat. - I'll give it to you.

1711
01:01:41,351 --> 01:01:42,592
The one she had on.

1712
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:43,592
(He tries to steal Ji Hyo's hat at her car.)

1713
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:45,822
Isn't this it? This is hers, right?

1714
01:01:46,262 --> 01:01:48,791
(He steals Ji Hyo's hat in no time.)

1715
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:51,632
(Sprinting)

1716
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:52,632
(On his way back to the restaurant)

1717
01:01:52,632 --> 01:01:54,462
The shirt Se Chan was wearing.

1718
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:56,532
(He finds Se Chan's car.)

1719
01:01:56,532 --> 01:01:58,471
(Excuse me for a moment.)

1720
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:00,641
Here it is!

1721
01:02:01,502 --> 01:02:02,541
The shirt.

1722
01:02:03,811 --> 01:02:05,942
(He steals Se Chan's shirt as well.)

1723
01:02:06,911 --> 01:02:09,012
(I just have to put it in the backpack.)

1724
01:02:09,012 --> 01:02:10,012
Wait!

1725
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:11,411
(He finds the messenger bag.)

1726
01:02:11,411 --> 01:02:12,451
Right?

1727
01:02:13,382 --> 01:02:14,951
Se Chan's shirt.

1728
01:02:14,951 --> 01:02:16,351
(Se Chan's shirt is the first item he stole.)

1729
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:19,621
And Ji Hyo's hat.

1730
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:23,891
(I stole 2 items!)

1731
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:27,632
(Furious Santa's Mission List)

1732
01:02:28,862 --> 01:02:32,371
This is the final mission to find the secret of today's race.

1733
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:35,041
It's Catch Me If You Can.

1734
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:36,112
(Final Mission: Catch Me If You Can)

1735
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:38,311
- I loved that movie. - "Catch Me If You Can"?

1736
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:39,641
Catch me if you can!

1737
01:02:39,882 --> 01:02:42,081
There are hints to solve the secret...

1738
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:44,681
in different places around the building.

1739
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,422
- There has to be. - Before the designated people...

1740
01:02:46,422 --> 01:02:48,552
complete their hidden mission,

1741
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:50,692
you must rip their name tags...

1742
01:02:50,752 --> 01:02:53,161
- and eliminate them all to win. - All of them?

1743
01:02:53,161 --> 01:02:54,291
(They must eliminate Furious Santa and his assistants...)

1744
01:02:54,291 --> 01:02:55,661
(before they complete the secret mission.)

1745
01:02:55,661 --> 01:02:57,431
- We don't know how many there are? - You don't.

1746
01:02:58,431 --> 01:03:00,331
You don't know how many people are related to the secret.

1747
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:03,831
However, if both of you are civilians in a couple,

1748
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,442
you win if you eliminate the most number of people.

1749
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:08,541
- That couple wins? - Yes.

1750
01:03:09,141 --> 01:03:11,371
You just keep eliminating people then.

1751
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:12,371
But...

1752
01:03:12,411 --> 01:03:16,081
if you eliminate people other than those who know the secret,

1753
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:18,811
the person who eliminated the other and the one who got eliminated...

1754
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:20,422
are both out.

1755
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,991
(If a civilian eliminates another civilian, they're both out.)

1756
01:03:22,991 --> 01:03:24,951
- Both of them are out? - Yes.

1757
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:26,322
Okay, I like this.

1758
01:03:26,322 --> 01:03:27,592
- There's nothing to lose. - This is good.

1759
01:03:27,592 --> 01:03:28,661
Excuse me.

1760
01:03:28,661 --> 01:03:31,092
You know what you said about me in the beginning?

1761
01:03:31,092 --> 01:03:33,161
Can you tell them again? I don't want them to be mistaken.

1762
01:03:33,161 --> 01:03:35,002
Seok Jin, be careful.

1763
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,002
Seok Jin, be careful.

1764
01:03:37,002 --> 01:03:38,902
Everybody, please move to different spots.

1765
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,471
Hey, don't be fooled by that!

1766
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:44,012
- We're going to run after you. - You know what?

1767
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:45,271
If you rip my name tag, you'll get eliminated.

1768
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:47,141
- I'm going to do this. - I'm nothing.

1769
01:03:47,141 --> 01:03:49,041
I'm nothing. It's fake.

1770
01:03:49,041 --> 01:03:51,112
- Come on. - It's fake.

1771
01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:52,982
I heard nothing.

1772
01:03:53,152 --> 01:03:54,851
I don't know anymore.

1773
01:03:55,221 --> 01:03:57,891
- Why are you doing this? - Please.

1774
01:03:57,891 --> 01:04:00,221
Why are you after me?

1775
01:04:00,661 --> 01:04:02,422
Did you get So Min's?

1776
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,462
I didn't.

1777
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:07,132
She holds on to her bag.

1778
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:11,331
(The Furious Santas talk in disguise.)

1779
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:13,601
(Se Chan is right after them.)

1780
01:04:14,172 --> 01:04:16,741
(Oh, my goodness!)

1781
01:04:17,672 --> 01:04:19,212
(He notices Se Chan.)

1782
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:20,382
Where do I go?

1783
01:04:20,382 --> 01:04:21,942
(He changes the topic.)

1784
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,112
This way?

1785
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:26,982
(Did he hear what we said?)

1786
01:04:26,982 --> 01:04:28,021
What did you talk about?

1787
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:29,552
(What did you two talk about?)

1788
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:33,561
(Fortunately, he didn't hear it.)

1789
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:35,021
(Kwang Soo leaves.)

1790
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,692
See you, Kwang Soo. Be careful.

1791
01:04:37,262 --> 01:04:39,032
(The Furious Santas are uneasy from the beginning.)

1792
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:43,701
(Will they be able to take revenge?)

1793
01:04:43,701 --> 01:04:45,132
The hints are...

1794
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:47,741
too vague so far.

1795
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:49,302
I'm certain about Seok Jin,

1796
01:04:49,541 --> 01:04:52,041
but the other parts are so vague.

1797
01:04:52,442 --> 01:04:54,181
I'm kind of confused.

1798
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,782
(Who are the assistants?)

1799
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:57,911
Maybe it's Hye Bin.

1800
01:04:57,911 --> 01:04:59,721
She's a couple with Seok Jin.

1801
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:02,181
I'm suspicious of Hye Bin.

1802
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:05,021
They're on the same team, so is she trying to protect him?

1803
01:05:06,121 --> 01:05:08,621
While we were in the car,

1804
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:10,262
we thought Soo Young was the assistant,

1805
01:05:10,262 --> 01:05:12,561
and it looked like she was acting and denying it.

1806
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:13,962
I think...

1807
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,561
- it's Soo Young. - Soo Young?

1808
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:16,732
(Chi Yeul is suspicious of Soo Young as well.)

1809
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:18,502
Think about it. She kept on looking for something.

1810
01:05:19,032 --> 01:05:20,101
I'm getting goosebumps.

1811
01:05:20,101 --> 01:05:21,471
Do you know who was looking for something?

1812
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:23,741
Kwang Soo was all day.

1813
01:05:23,971 --> 01:05:25,971
Do you know what he was looking for?

1814
01:05:26,041 --> 01:05:27,141
What is it? Do you know?

1815
01:05:27,141 --> 01:05:29,041
- I do. - Tell us what it is.

1816
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:30,482
I can't.

1817
01:05:31,212 --> 01:05:32,252
- Hey. - Hold on.

1818
01:05:32,252 --> 01:05:34,221
(He knows, but he can't tell them?)

1819
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:35,851
- Hey. - Did you receive instructions?

1820
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:37,152
All this time...

1821
01:05:37,891 --> 01:05:39,052
I can't.

1822
01:05:39,052 --> 01:05:41,121
(Chi Yeul knows something. Is he the assistant?)

1823
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,431
Chi Yeul?

1824
01:05:44,491 --> 01:05:47,201
I think it's one of the male guests.

1825
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:48,701
Chi Yeul or Sung Hoon.

1826
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:51,002
I suspect Soo Young and Sung Hoon as the assistants.

1827
01:05:51,002 --> 01:05:53,871
(Sung Hoon is the other male guest.)

1828
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:59,212
(Who are the 2 assistants from the guests?)

1829
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:01,212
The race will start.

1830
01:06:01,212 --> 01:06:02,712
(Will the Furious Santas and the assistants steal first?)

1831
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:04,252
(Will the Furious Santas and the assistants steal first?)

1832
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,081
(Or will they get eliminated first?)

1833
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:08,282
(Or will they get eliminated first?)

1834
01:06:08,282 --> 01:06:10,351
(The last race of 2018!)

1835
01:06:10,351 --> 01:06:11,552
This is such a difficult mission.

1836
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:12,891
The race starts.

1837
01:06:15,192 --> 01:06:17,092
I have to look for hints.

1838
01:06:17,632 --> 01:06:19,032
I have to find the hints.

1839
01:06:20,002 --> 01:06:21,902
Quick. Let's find it.

1840
01:06:21,902 --> 01:06:23,701
(They must find the hints to track down the assistants.)

1841
01:06:23,701 --> 01:06:24,871
Where is it?

1842
01:06:25,172 --> 01:06:26,701
(Everybody is focused on finding the hints.)

1843
01:06:26,701 --> 01:06:27,741
How should I do this?

1844
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:31,172
How do I steal this secretly?

1845
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:32,612
It's impossible.

1846
01:06:33,112 --> 01:06:34,581
(It's Freddie Mercury again.)

1847
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:36,652
(He was passing by.)

1848
01:06:36,652 --> 01:06:38,451
- What are you looking for? - Hints.

1849
01:06:38,451 --> 01:06:39,752
(Jae Seok strikes up a conversation.)

1850
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:42,521
(He's obviously flustered.)

1851
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:44,451
You look surprised.

1852
01:06:44,721 --> 01:06:46,221
- I was coming... - No way.

1853
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:48,762
You were surprised when you saw me.

1854
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:49,962
What are you today?

1855
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:52,262
What are you talking about?

1856
01:06:52,262 --> 01:06:53,402
What are you?

1857
01:06:53,402 --> 01:06:54,802
Don't be suspicious of me.

1858
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,172
I swear it's not me.

1859
01:06:56,172 --> 01:06:57,831
It's common sense.

1860
01:06:57,831 --> 01:06:59,271
If you're not related...

1861
01:06:59,271 --> 01:07:00,402
- What's he doing here? - You scared me.

1862
01:07:00,402 --> 01:07:01,771
(His lifesaver is here.)

1863
01:07:01,771 --> 01:07:02,942
- What's he doing here? - You scared me.

1864
01:07:03,012 --> 01:07:04,342
I told you it's not me.

1865
01:07:04,342 --> 01:07:05,911
But I have all the hints.

1866
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:07,681
Calm down!

1867
01:07:07,681 --> 01:07:10,451
- I can't help it. - You'll die.

1868
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:12,851
I have three hints, and they're all about you.

1869
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:14,552
What do you mean? Stop lying.

1870
01:07:14,552 --> 01:07:16,192
I didn't do anything.

1871
01:07:16,192 --> 01:07:17,521
You acted so strangely just now.

1872
01:07:17,521 --> 01:07:18,752
No, look.

1873
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:20,322
This is a trick, Kwang Soo.

1874
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:24,362
It can't be a trick. You're involved in it.

1875
01:07:24,362 --> 01:07:26,232
What's "involve"?

1876
01:07:26,232 --> 01:07:27,831
You're a part of it.

1877
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:29,002
Have you heard about the assistants?

1878
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:30,402
Yes, I did.

1879
01:07:30,471 --> 01:07:32,471
Two of the guests are the assistants.

1880
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:33,672
Jae Seok.

1881
01:07:33,672 --> 01:07:35,802
Both of you will die if you rip my name tag.

1882
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,572
Okay, I'll go for it.

1883
01:07:37,572 --> 01:07:40,141
(I'll rip your name tag!)

1884
01:07:40,382 --> 01:07:41,641
Okay, I'll go for it.

1885
01:07:42,712 --> 01:07:44,612
- Don't. - See?

1886
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:46,182
You're being weak.

1887
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:47,382
No, we just started.

1888
01:07:47,382 --> 01:07:48,882
I was going for it, and you...

1889
01:07:48,882 --> 01:07:50,052
- You have to find it. - This won't work.

1890
01:07:50,052 --> 01:07:51,491
Jae Seok, rip it.

1891
01:07:51,491 --> 01:07:52,892
(Jae Seok, rip Seok Jin's name tag.)

1892
01:07:52,892 --> 01:07:54,092
- You rip it. - Sure.

1893
01:07:54,092 --> 01:07:55,791
(He yields.)

1894
01:07:55,791 --> 01:07:58,331
- No. You can do it. - You rip it.

1895
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,932
You know?

1896
01:07:59,932 --> 01:08:01,432
- Hey. - Jae Seok, rip it!

1897
01:08:02,302 --> 01:08:03,731
- Jae Seok! - Kwang Soo,

1898
01:08:03,731 --> 01:08:04,972
- it's not time yet. - Hey.

1899
01:08:04,972 --> 01:08:06,401
- I'm not certain. - Look, guys.

1900
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,842
- I'm not certain. - This is a trick.

1901
01:08:07,842 --> 01:08:09,842
I'm not certain, so I can't rip it.

1902
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:12,441
Hold on. I have no hints so far.

1903
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:14,611
- I can't rip it yet. - Let's find a hint.

1904
01:08:14,611 --> 01:08:15,812
Oh, gosh.

1905
01:08:15,812 --> 01:08:17,651
(He was scared to death.)

1906
01:08:19,882 --> 01:08:22,852
(It's difficult being Furious Santa.)

1907
01:08:23,022 --> 01:08:24,691
I won't be able to live as a criminal.

1908
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:25,852
I won't be able to live as a criminal.

1909
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:26,962
(He's relieved now.)

1910
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:30,531
What does this mean?

1911
01:08:30,762 --> 01:08:32,731
I don't get this hint.

1912
01:08:32,932 --> 01:08:34,132
The second hint.

1913
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:35,831
"Valuables in the counter."

1914
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:38,901
"We're not responsible for lost items."

1915
01:08:39,701 --> 01:08:42,302
(The Furious Santas might steal their valuables,)

1916
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:44,672
(so it was a hint to warn them about losing items.)

1917
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,212
"We're not responsible for lost items."

1918
01:08:46,941 --> 01:08:48,111
The counter?

1919
01:08:49,142 --> 01:08:50,411
There are many counters here.

1920
01:08:50,411 --> 01:08:52,611
The security guards are at a counter.

1921
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:55,222
There's a counter on the first floor too.

1922
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:59,552
Seok Jin was never interested in my clothes before.

1923
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:00,991
We were talking on the bus.

1924
01:09:00,991 --> 01:09:02,022
(Seok Jin kept on talking about one thing.)

1925
01:09:02,621 --> 01:09:04,892
(Do you have a frog?)

1926
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:08,632
(A frog all of a sudden?)

1927
01:09:09,602 --> 01:09:10,602
Hold on.

1928
01:09:10,602 --> 01:09:11,932
(She thinks about what Seok Jin said.)

1929
01:09:11,932 --> 01:09:13,142
(Jeon So Min)

1930
01:09:13,642 --> 01:09:14,842
It's on this.

1931
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:18,041
(There's a frog sticker.)

1932
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:21,842
Then I should leave this at the counter?

1933
01:09:21,842 --> 01:09:23,781
(Her valuable is the pouch.)

1934
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:25,012
Where's the counter?

1935
01:09:25,012 --> 01:09:26,481
(Leave it at the counter?)

1936
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:28,052
I'm in trouble.

1937
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:29,522
Before coming here,

1938
01:09:29,522 --> 01:09:30,821
(He's looking for So Min everywhere.)

1939
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,651
I should have done two more at least.

1940
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,762
I have to look for So Min.

1941
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:36,731
(How do I take the sticker without her knowing?)

1942
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:41,031
(So Min heads for the counter.)

1943
01:09:41,602 --> 01:09:42,731
Hello.

1944
01:09:42,731 --> 01:09:44,331
(She leaves her valuable in the counter.)

1945
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:46,441
Can I keep my pouch...

1946
01:09:47,102 --> 01:09:49,272
here?

1947
01:09:49,272 --> 01:09:50,371
Thank you.

1948
01:09:50,371 --> 01:09:51,741
(This is how the Top Excellence Award recipient interpreted it.)

1949
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:54,111
(She left her valuable behind, so it's time to look for hints!)

1950
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:55,712
(I'm a genius.)

1951
01:09:56,752 --> 01:09:59,481
I wish I had another hint. This is driving me nuts.

1952
01:09:59,481 --> 01:10:00,682
(He was watching everything!)

1953
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:02,422
I have to look for hints.

1954
01:10:02,422 --> 01:10:03,752
(So Min doesn't notice, and she leaves the counter.)

1955
01:10:03,752 --> 01:10:05,451
This is so frustrating.

1956
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:07,962
(What did So Min do here?)

1957
01:10:07,962 --> 01:10:09,222
Oh, goodness.

1958
01:10:09,222 --> 01:10:10,962
(He starts moving before Se Chan can find it.)

1959
01:10:10,962 --> 01:10:12,062
What's there?

1960
01:10:12,191 --> 01:10:13,361
I'm looking for hints.

1961
01:10:13,802 --> 01:10:16,502
(While Se Chan is looking elsewhere for hints,)

1962
01:10:16,502 --> 01:10:18,932
(he goes behind the counter...)

1963
01:10:18,932 --> 01:10:21,272
(and sees the pouch inside a trash can.)

1964
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:25,212
(He has to avoid Se Chan's attention and take it out.)

1965
01:10:25,212 --> 01:10:26,272
Who's that?

1966
01:10:26,812 --> 01:10:28,441
- It's Lee Elijah. - Is it Lee Elijah?

1967
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:30,552
Are you giving us hints?

1968
01:10:30,852 --> 01:10:31,852
What is it?

1969
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,222
What are you doing?

1970
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:35,182
What's wrong with her?

1971
01:10:35,382 --> 01:10:36,991
What is it? Are you giving us hints?

1972
01:10:36,991 --> 01:10:38,121
(He leaves while the attention is on Lee Elijah.)

1973
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:39,151
Elijah.

1974
01:10:39,252 --> 01:10:40,361
You surprised me.

1975
01:10:41,092 --> 01:10:42,562
For a moment, I thought she was today's guest,

1976
01:10:42,562 --> 01:10:44,392
and I didn't recognize her.

1977
01:10:44,762 --> 01:10:46,361
- Hello. - Have you been well?

1978
01:10:46,861 --> 01:10:48,762
- You're filming a drama. - Your hairstyle changed a lot.

1979
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:51,371
- Yes. I watch your drama. - Really?

1980
01:10:51,432 --> 01:10:53,342
- Elijah. - Hello.

1981
01:10:53,441 --> 01:10:54,701
Good luck filming.

1982
01:10:54,701 --> 01:10:55,972
Okay. Thank you.

1983
01:10:55,972 --> 01:10:57,441
There are too many people.

1984
01:10:57,441 --> 01:10:58,712
(What do I do?)

1985
01:10:58,712 --> 01:10:59,741
See you.

1986
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:01,682
(She leaves after a short time.)

1987
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:02,882
- Good luck. - Okay.

1988
01:11:02,882 --> 01:11:04,081
Elijah,

1989
01:11:04,382 --> 01:11:05,882
- can I ask you for a favor? - What is it?

1990
01:11:07,252 --> 01:11:08,552
I have a favor to ask of you. Come here.

1991
01:11:08,552 --> 01:11:11,252
(Is he asking her for a favor all of a sudden?)

1992
01:11:11,252 --> 01:11:12,752
I have a favor to ask of you.

1993
01:11:12,752 --> 01:11:15,121
(He hides behind a pillar.)

1994
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:17,462
- Do you see the security office? - Yes.

1995
01:11:17,462 --> 01:11:19,191
In the trash can...

1996
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,802
Okay. I'm getting nervous.

1997
01:11:20,802 --> 01:11:22,632
In the trash can, there's a pouch like this.

1998
01:11:22,661 --> 01:11:24,272
It's So Min's.

1999
01:11:24,272 --> 01:11:27,241
There's a frog sticker on it.

2000
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,701
- Can you get it for me? - Are you sure?

2001
01:11:28,772 --> 01:11:30,411
- I'll try my best. - Please.

2002
01:11:31,772 --> 01:11:33,611
(In order to steal it without getting noticed,)

2003
01:11:33,611 --> 01:11:37,281
(he asks Elijah.)

2004
01:11:38,352 --> 01:11:41,481
(I will accomplish this important mission!)

2005
01:11:42,081 --> 01:11:44,392
(She approaches the counter.)

2006
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:46,252
I hope she doesn't get caught.

2007
01:11:46,252 --> 01:11:48,661
(He worries a lot.)

2008
01:11:50,231 --> 01:11:52,762
(She's looking in the trash can.)

2009
01:11:53,632 --> 01:11:56,672
(She doesn't mind the dirty work.)

2010
01:11:57,701 --> 01:11:59,432
What are you doing?

2011
01:11:59,432 --> 01:12:01,142
- What are you doing there? - Nothing.

2012
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:04,142
(They're both flustered.)

2013
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:05,812
- What are you doing? - Nothing.

2014
01:12:06,371 --> 01:12:07,581
Why are you looking in the trash can?

2015
01:12:08,182 --> 01:12:09,951
This can't be on TV.

2016
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,281
It's personal business.

2017
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:12,981
Is it your personal business to look in the trash can?

2018
01:12:12,981 --> 01:12:14,682
(He doesn't understand.)

2019
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:16,922
- What is it? - Please leave me alone.

2020
01:12:16,922 --> 01:12:18,922
(He finds So Min's pouch in the trash can.)

2021
01:12:21,222 --> 01:12:22,291
Why is this here?

2022
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:24,062
What is it? Where did you get this from?

2023
01:12:24,231 --> 01:12:26,432
- Give it to me. - It was here.

2024
01:12:26,432 --> 01:12:27,661
- Whose is it? - So Min's.

2025
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:29,262
- Give it to me. - Let me see.

2026
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,602
(They fight over the pouch.)

2027
01:12:30,602 --> 01:12:31,972
- Let's see. - Hold on.

2028
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:33,502
- Kwang Soo. - Let go.

2029
01:12:33,502 --> 01:12:35,502
- Let go. - Hold on.

2030
01:12:35,502 --> 01:12:37,012
(She casually walks away.)

2031
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,382
Did you get it? Hurry up and give it to me.

2032
01:12:40,382 --> 01:12:42,142
Thank you. Thank you so much.

2033
01:12:42,312 --> 01:12:43,581
Thank you so much. You completed an important task.

2034
01:12:45,552 --> 01:12:46,821
Thank you so much. Good luck.

2035
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:48,882
- Thank you, Elijah. - You are set now, right?

2036
01:12:48,882 --> 01:12:52,491
(We thank Elijah, a family member of Running Man.)

2037
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:53,491
I did it.

2038
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:57,632
(He succeeds if he puts it in the newbie producer's bag.)

2039
01:12:58,191 --> 01:13:01,262
(He walks over without hesitation and puts it inside the bag.)

2040
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:05,172
(He gets So Min's frog sticker thanks to Elijah.)

2041
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:07,071
(Furious Santa's Mission List)

2042
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,342
(Jeon So Min's frog item has been cleared.)

2043
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,111
(The sun has set.)

2044
01:13:12,342 --> 01:13:14,812
(An assistant candidate, Soo Young, heads somewhere.)

2045
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:15,882
Soo Young!

2046
01:13:15,882 --> 01:13:17,252
(You startled me.)

2047
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:18,951
(Is Soo Young an assistant?)

2048
01:13:18,951 --> 01:13:20,722
Tell me you aren't an assistant. You aren't, are you?

2049
01:13:20,722 --> 01:13:23,182
I swear I am not an assistant. I have been wrongly accused.

2050
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:24,522
Don't be that way.

2051
01:13:24,522 --> 01:13:25,892
You fooled me once.

2052
01:13:25,892 --> 01:13:28,121
There are two cameramen following you.

2053
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:30,531
People are suspecting me because of you.

2054
01:13:30,962 --> 01:13:32,231
Did you find a hint?

2055
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,361
What?

2056
01:13:35,361 --> 01:13:36,932
Don't open your eyes that way!

2057
01:13:36,932 --> 01:13:38,432
Stop!

2058
01:13:38,972 --> 01:13:40,071
I am not an assistant!

2059
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:42,401
(Distrustful)

2060
01:13:43,441 --> 01:13:45,842
- What? - Soo Young drives me crazy.

2061
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:47,312
- I didn't do anything. - All right.

2062
01:13:47,312 --> 01:13:48,812
- Search this area. - Okay.

2063
01:13:49,041 --> 01:13:51,012
- No ripping off the name tag. - Of course not.

2064
01:13:51,312 --> 01:13:53,382
- I promise. - I will have my guards down.

2065
01:13:53,382 --> 01:13:54,522
Okay. Me, too.

2066
01:13:55,182 --> 01:13:57,951
(As soon as he parts with Soo Young,)

2067
01:13:59,222 --> 01:14:01,491
(he finds a hint.)

2068
01:14:02,392 --> 01:14:03,531
Gosh, what is this?

2069
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:07,231
(Assistant A is a woman with S in her name.)

2070
01:14:07,701 --> 01:14:10,802
(That means it's either Seon Hwa or Soo Young.)

2071
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,172
(My goodness.)

2072
01:14:13,172 --> 01:14:14,741
Gosh, what is this?

2073
01:14:14,741 --> 01:14:15,802
Share it with me.

2074
01:14:15,802 --> 01:14:18,712
I don't want to do that. I found this.

2075
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:20,812
- Share it with me. - Hold on, Soo Young.

2076
01:14:20,812 --> 01:14:22,712
You could be an assistant.

2077
01:14:23,111 --> 01:14:25,212
I am not an assistant. We should help each other.

2078
01:14:25,212 --> 01:14:26,722
I get that, but...

2079
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:28,752
Hold on, Soo Young.

2080
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:31,092
- I will be honest with you. - Okay.

2081
01:14:31,892 --> 01:14:33,621
- I am scared of you. - Why?

2082
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,161
(He is too honest.)

2083
01:14:35,161 --> 01:14:36,892
I really want to go to the restroom right now.

2084
01:14:37,932 --> 01:14:40,932
After I become certain that you aren't an assistant,

2085
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:42,432
I will share this hint with you. I promise.

2086
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,231
I can't do it now.

2087
01:14:44,472 --> 01:14:46,772
- All right. - Okay. Don't rip off my name tag.

2088
01:14:46,772 --> 01:14:49,541
(He needs to be careful until he becomes certain.)

2089
01:14:51,012 --> 01:14:54,342
(People is suspicious of Hye Bin since she is Seok Jin's partner.)

2090
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:57,111
(Walking down the hallway,)

2091
01:14:57,111 --> 01:15:00,081
(she finds a hint.)

2092
01:15:01,222 --> 01:15:02,981
(Assistant A is the same age as one of the guests.)

2093
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:05,151
(Sung Hoon, Hye Bin, Kwang Soo, Soo Young, Seon Hwa)

2094
01:15:05,151 --> 01:15:08,062
The same age as one of the guests.

2095
01:15:08,062 --> 01:15:09,321
(Assistant A is a woman with S in her name.)

2096
01:15:09,321 --> 01:15:10,731
Then there are two candidates.

2097
01:15:11,331 --> 01:15:12,491
Two candidates.

2098
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:14,231
Seon Hwa.

2099
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:15,632
(She was strongly suspicious of Seon Hwa before the race.)

2100
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:17,831
It's her first time on Running Man.

2101
01:15:18,602 --> 01:15:19,731
I get it now.

2102
01:15:20,041 --> 01:15:21,571
It's a bingo.

2103
01:15:23,071 --> 01:15:24,512
(She becomes sure after obtaining a hint.)

2104
01:15:24,512 --> 01:15:25,611
Where should I go?

2105
01:15:25,611 --> 01:15:27,142
(She becomes sure after obtaining a hint.)

2106
01:15:28,642 --> 01:15:30,812
(She spots Jong Kook and Soo Young, a strong assistant candidate.)

2107
01:15:30,812 --> 01:15:31,951
Should I go first?

2108
01:15:31,951 --> 01:15:33,422
- It's you, right? - It's me.

2109
01:15:33,422 --> 01:15:34,581
Rip off my name tag.

2110
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:37,691
(It would be better to get my name tag ripped off.)

2111
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,092
I should go first.

2112
01:15:39,922 --> 01:15:41,191
Did you find a hint?

2113
01:15:41,191 --> 01:15:42,222
Yes, I did.

2114
01:15:42,222 --> 01:15:43,392
- Really? - Yes.

2115
01:15:43,392 --> 01:15:45,262
What is the hint? Share it with us.

2116
01:15:45,262 --> 01:15:46,731
I only know what I know.

2117
01:15:46,731 --> 01:15:48,062
Tell us what you know.

2118
01:15:48,062 --> 01:15:49,661
(Does she want to remove suspicion by sharing the hint?)

2119
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,932
Seok Jin is definitely innocent.

2120
01:15:51,932 --> 01:15:53,541
(Is that the hint?)

2121
01:15:53,642 --> 01:15:55,602
- What? - Really?

2122
01:15:55,602 --> 01:15:57,512
Was that the hint?

2123
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:58,941
Seon Hwa told me this.

2124
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:00,281
(Seon Hwa told me this.)

2125
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:03,411
The hint we found said that Seok Jin is a Furious Santa.

2126
01:16:03,411 --> 01:16:04,512
(What are you talking about?)

2127
01:16:04,512 --> 01:16:06,081
- That's right. - Really?

2128
01:16:06,951 --> 01:16:09,121
Did it say that Seok Jin is a Furious Santa?

2129
01:16:09,321 --> 01:16:11,791
Seon Hwa said she got the information from you.

2130
01:16:11,821 --> 01:16:13,991
- Really? - I didn't say a word.

2131
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,991
She said she heard you say that.

2132
01:16:15,991 --> 01:16:17,432
I didn't say a word.

2133
01:16:17,432 --> 01:16:18,791
(What exactly happened?)

2134
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:20,062
You found a hint, right?

2135
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:22,602
- I heard something. - What did you hear?

2136
01:16:22,802 --> 01:16:24,002
- What? - What did you hear?

2137
01:16:24,002 --> 01:16:25,071
(The hint Seon Hwa overheard is...)

2138
01:16:25,071 --> 01:16:28,642
Seok Jin is a civilian.

2139
01:16:28,741 --> 01:16:30,371
A civilian? Are you certain?

2140
01:16:30,371 --> 01:16:31,842
I am certain.

2141
01:16:31,941 --> 01:16:33,611
Who gave you this information?

2142
01:16:34,441 --> 01:16:36,411
Jong Kook said it as he was passing by.

2143
01:16:36,852 --> 01:16:38,151
Jong Kook?

2144
01:16:38,151 --> 01:16:40,781
(That means...)

2145
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:42,052
Seon Hwa is an assistant.

2146
01:16:42,052 --> 01:16:43,081
I didn't say a word.

2147
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:44,451
Seon Hwa is an assistant.

2148
01:16:44,451 --> 01:16:45,722
I didn't say a word.

2149
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,161
I haven't talked to her.

2150
01:16:48,161 --> 01:16:51,291
- She might be an assistant. - She might be an assistant.

2151
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:52,331
That's right.

2152
01:16:52,892 --> 01:16:54,831
I need to find Seon Hwa,

2153
01:16:55,102 --> 01:16:57,602
who is most likely to be an assistant.

2154
01:16:57,602 --> 01:17:00,472
(Hye Bin's target is Seon Hwa.)

2155
01:17:00,871 --> 01:17:02,302
(She finds a woman with a secret,)

2156
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:04,842
(Seon Hwa.)

2157
01:17:05,111 --> 01:17:06,741
I will remove Seok Jin's name tag.

2158
01:17:06,741 --> 01:17:07,741
(Seon Hwa said Seok Jin isn't a Furious Santa.)

2159
01:17:07,741 --> 01:17:10,041
I don't care. I don't mind...

2160
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:11,382
getting eliminated.

2161
01:17:11,382 --> 01:17:12,852
(She has no reason to lie unless she is an assistant.)

2162
01:17:12,852 --> 01:17:14,121
Why did you show up again?

2163
01:17:14,252 --> 01:17:15,522
Excuse me?

2164
01:17:15,781 --> 01:17:17,252
What kind of a question is that?

2165
01:17:17,252 --> 01:17:18,621
Why did you show up again?

2166
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,161
(When Seon Hwa is looking elsewhere...)

2167
01:17:21,291 --> 01:17:23,262
(Ripping)

2168
01:17:23,321 --> 01:17:24,432
What happened?

2169
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,802
(She removes the name tag in an instant.)

2170
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:28,401
What happened?

2171
01:17:28,401 --> 01:17:31,602
(Is Seon Hwa an assistant?)

2172
01:17:32,132 --> 01:17:33,472
Are you not an assistant?

2173
01:17:33,472 --> 01:17:34,901
- What was that? - That startled me.

2174
01:17:35,002 --> 01:17:36,371
That happened so suddenly.

2175
01:17:36,371 --> 01:17:38,111
- Are you not an assistant? - Why did you rip off her name tag?

2176
01:17:38,672 --> 01:17:39,871
That happened so suddenly.

2177
01:17:39,871 --> 01:17:41,712
What was that?

2178
01:17:41,712 --> 01:17:43,951
I was just standing here!

2179
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:45,852
That happened so suddenly.

2180
01:17:45,852 --> 01:17:47,252
Hye Bin, why did you do that?

2181
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,451
(That means the assistant is...)

2182
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:53,222
(Soo Young.)

2183
01:17:53,522 --> 01:17:56,831
The assistants who will help you are here.

2184
01:17:56,831 --> 01:17:58,031
Are there assistants?

2185
01:17:58,361 --> 01:17:59,791
Assistants, come in.

2186
01:17:59,791 --> 01:18:00,831
Who are they?

2187
01:18:01,531 --> 01:18:04,132
(The first assistant)

2188
01:18:04,672 --> 01:18:05,731
Soo Young!

2189
01:18:05,731 --> 01:18:07,071
It has been a while.

2190
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:11,241
With Furious Santas, Seok Jin and Kwang Soo,

2191
01:18:11,512 --> 01:18:13,642
you will steal the members' items.

2192
01:18:13,642 --> 01:18:15,081
- We will work together, right? - Yes.

2193
01:18:15,842 --> 01:18:19,581
This is bad. We picked the items that are impossible to steal.

2194
01:18:19,581 --> 01:18:21,852
- I can get Jong Kook's bag. - How?

2195
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:24,052
I was a couple with Jong Kook before, right?

2196
01:18:24,052 --> 01:18:27,491
He believes what I say.

2197
01:18:27,491 --> 01:18:28,491
That's right.

2198
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:30,092
(A plan to steal Jong Kook's bag)

2199
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:32,462
Jong Kook, may I please put this in your bag?

2200
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,632
- Sure. - It's light.

2201
01:18:33,632 --> 01:18:35,231
(Become a couple with Jong Kook and put a pouch in his bag.)

2202
01:18:35,762 --> 01:18:37,071
Thank you.

2203
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,772
I put my pouch in Jong Kook's bag.

2204
01:18:39,772 --> 01:18:42,441
(If you can't do it by force, use a thorough plan.)

2205
01:18:43,741 --> 01:18:47,541
(When people's suspicion falls on her,)

2206
01:18:48,941 --> 01:18:51,951
(she eyes the location of the newbie producer.)

2207
01:18:52,481 --> 01:18:54,352
I really want to go to the restroom.

2208
01:18:54,882 --> 01:18:56,821
(Why is she telling me that?)

2209
01:18:56,821 --> 01:18:58,422
What? You should go.

2210
01:18:59,191 --> 01:19:01,121
- Would you give me my pouch? - Sure.

2211
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:02,121
(She put it in his bag earlier.)

2212
01:19:02,592 --> 01:19:03,731
Okay.

2213
01:19:03,731 --> 01:19:04,861
Just...

2214
01:19:04,861 --> 01:19:06,161
(He takes it out.)

2215
01:19:06,661 --> 01:19:07,731
It's okay.

2216
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:08,802
(If you take it out, I won't be able to steal your bag.)

2217
01:19:08,802 --> 01:19:10,031
It's embarrassing.

2218
01:19:10,502 --> 01:19:11,632
It's embarrassing.

2219
01:19:11,632 --> 01:19:12,972
- Do you want me to go with you? - Yes.

2220
01:19:12,972 --> 01:19:14,941
(He accompanies her to the restroom.)

2221
01:19:16,241 --> 01:19:19,212
(It's no wonder he is the winner of the Best Couple Award.)

2222
01:19:19,772 --> 01:19:21,911
(Soo Young calculates the distance to the newbie producer.)

2223
01:19:22,611 --> 01:19:24,752
(He is close enough.)

2224
01:19:25,712 --> 01:19:27,382
(Jong Kook walks ahead of her.)

2225
01:19:27,382 --> 01:19:29,081
(Reaching)

2226
01:19:29,081 --> 01:19:30,922
I can get Jong Kook's bag.

2227
01:19:30,922 --> 01:19:32,151
(Will she steal his bag when so many people are watching?)

2228
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:33,151
This one?

2229
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:34,861
I will take this.

2230
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:37,531
(She unclasps the bag.)

2231
01:19:37,531 --> 01:19:38,691
- I will take this. - What?

2232
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:39,861
Why are you taking that?

2233
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:41,531
I will take this.

2234
01:19:41,531 --> 01:19:43,302
(While Jong Kook is flustered,)

2235
01:19:43,302 --> 01:19:44,672
(she goes to the newbie producer.)

2236
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:46,502
To get Jong Kook's bag,

2237
01:19:46,502 --> 01:19:49,602
you should take the bag and run towards the newbie producer.

2238
01:19:49,602 --> 01:19:50,642
(It's the only way to steal Jong Kook's bag.)

2239
01:19:50,642 --> 01:19:51,642
(It's a suicide mission.)

2240
01:19:51,642 --> 01:19:53,012
- That's right. - That's the only way.

2241
01:19:55,012 --> 01:19:58,012
(Soo Young's behavior is unexpected.)

2242
01:19:58,012 --> 01:20:00,781
(What is going on?)

2243
01:20:01,022 --> 01:20:02,882
Why are you taking that? Soo Young.

2244
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:04,321
Why are you taking that?

2245
01:20:04,392 --> 01:20:06,651
Soo Young, what are you doing in front of so many people?

2246
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:08,121
Soo Young.

2247
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:10,022
Soo Young, what are you doing?

2248
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,092
What?

2249
01:20:11,092 --> 01:20:12,432
Come on.

2250
01:20:12,432 --> 01:20:14,731
(Is she revealing herself as an assistant?)

2251
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:16,361
- What? - I really need to go...

2252
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:18,772
- to the restroom. - What are you doing?

2253
01:20:18,831 --> 01:20:20,031
Why are you...

2254
01:20:20,031 --> 01:20:21,672
(Soo Young carries out a suicide mission...)

2255
01:20:21,672 --> 01:20:24,842
(and steals Jong Kook's bag successfully.)

2256
01:20:26,312 --> 01:20:27,642
Why did you take my bag?

2257
01:20:27,642 --> 01:20:28,712
Get her.

2258
01:20:28,712 --> 01:20:30,142
If you get her, I will remove her name tag.

2259
01:20:30,142 --> 01:20:31,812
- Get her. - You are an assistant.

2260
01:20:31,812 --> 01:20:33,111
- It's you. - You are wrong.

2261
01:20:33,111 --> 01:20:34,321
- I am not an assistant. - Be honest.

2262
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:35,382
What about me?

2263
01:20:35,382 --> 01:20:36,951
- I am not an assistant. - I am 100 percent sure.

2264
01:20:36,951 --> 01:20:38,092
- I am not an assistant. - It's you.

2265
01:20:38,092 --> 01:20:39,892
I am serious. Jong Kook!

2266
01:20:39,892 --> 01:20:41,121
- You are wrong. - I will remove her name tag.

2267
01:20:41,121 --> 01:20:44,062
(Chi Yeul takes her out.)

2268
01:20:44,962 --> 01:20:47,201
(An assistant, Soo Young is out.)

2269
01:20:47,201 --> 01:20:48,361
Is there something? Let's see it.

2270
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:51,231
I am not an assistant. You are making a grave mistake.

2271
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:52,302
Is she not an assistant?

2272
01:20:52,772 --> 01:20:54,041
She is an assistant!

2273
01:20:54,041 --> 01:20:57,241
(Jong Kook got betrayed by Soo Young.)

2274
01:20:57,342 --> 01:20:58,541
My goodness.

2275
01:20:58,541 --> 01:21:00,411
I thought she was suspicious.

2276
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:03,382
I can't believe you. You took advantage of me.

2277
01:21:03,382 --> 01:21:04,651
(Soo Young took advantage of him twice.)

2278
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:07,651
(Furious Santa's Mission List)

2279
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:10,491
(Kim Jong Kook's messenger bag has been cleared.)

2280
01:21:11,022 --> 01:21:13,522
We need to get a cell phone.

2281
01:21:13,892 --> 01:21:17,161
Gosh, we picked the most difficult items.

2282
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:21,531
(Jae Seok follows him quietly.)

2283
01:21:23,502 --> 01:21:26,071
(He needs definite proof...)

2284
01:21:26,071 --> 01:21:27,302
(to assure his suspicion.)

2285
01:21:28,772 --> 01:21:32,541
(He trails Seok Jin instead of looking for hints.)

2286
01:21:34,312 --> 01:21:35,682
(Seok Jin looks around.)

2287
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:36,911
Who are left?

2288
01:21:38,651 --> 01:21:40,621
- Who are left? - Turn off the light.

2289
01:21:42,382 --> 01:21:43,991
Haha, Jong Kook,

2290
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:45,191
(He has no idea that Jae Seok is listening.)

2291
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:46,352
and Jae Seok, right?

2292
01:21:46,352 --> 01:21:48,422
There are many people...

2293
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:50,531
who don't believe I am a Furious Santa.

2294
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:51,531
(He says things that reveal his identity.)

2295
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:52,791
They won't be able to remove my name tag.

2296
01:21:53,562 --> 01:21:56,231
(Jae Seok hears everything.)

2297
01:21:57,432 --> 01:22:01,071
(His suspicion turns into conviction.)

2298
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:03,842
I will rip it off right away.

2299
01:22:05,842 --> 01:22:07,741
(When Seok Jin shows his back,)

2300
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:09,441
(Jae Seok runs towards him.)

2301
01:22:09,441 --> 01:22:11,382
What are you doing?

2302
01:22:11,382 --> 01:22:12,712
What did you talk about?

2303
01:22:12,712 --> 01:22:15,281
(His target is Seok Jin, a Furious Santa.)

2304
01:22:15,281 --> 01:22:16,481
What did you talk about?

2305
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:17,791
(There is no reason to hesitate.)

2306
01:22:17,791 --> 01:22:19,991
Furious Santa.

2307
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:22,392
Come here. Come here, Furious Santa.

2308
01:22:22,491 --> 01:22:24,762
You don't even know what Furious Santa is.

2309
01:22:25,661 --> 01:22:27,062
Come here, Furious Santa.

2310
01:22:27,432 --> 01:22:29,701
(He has no chance against Jae Seok.)

2311
01:22:29,701 --> 01:22:31,502
Come here.

2312
01:22:31,502 --> 01:22:33,871
(A Furious Santa, Seok Jin is out.)

2313
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:35,401
- Is it over? - I was right.

2314
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:37,642
- I am out. - You were a Furious Santa.

2315
01:22:37,642 --> 01:22:38,842
(Following Soo Young, Seok Jin is also out.)

2316
01:22:39,071 --> 01:22:41,812
He has a keen sense of smell and good hearing.

2317
01:22:41,882 --> 01:22:43,111
Did you tail me?

2318
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:45,951
- I just followed you. - I had no idea he was behind me.

2319
01:22:45,951 --> 01:22:47,481
(This is how good Jae Seok's instincts are.)

2320
01:22:48,022 --> 01:22:49,052
Are you out?

2321
01:22:49,651 --> 01:22:51,892
- Gosh, he'll eliminate you too. - What were you?

2322
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:53,392
- What? - What were you?

2323
01:22:53,392 --> 01:22:55,191
Stop trying to take a look.

2324
01:22:55,191 --> 01:22:56,991
Jae Seok didn't die because I'm the Furious Santa.

2325
01:22:56,991 --> 01:22:58,291
He's the Furious Santa.

2326
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,432
(How can you get eliminated this quickly?)

2327
01:23:00,432 --> 01:23:01,432
Go, Seok Jin.

2328
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:03,831
(He's heading to prison leaving behind his disappointment.)

2329
01:23:03,831 --> 01:23:04,932
He left the cameraman.

2330
01:23:04,932 --> 01:23:07,142
- Seok Jin! Get in the elevator. - Hold on.

2331
01:23:07,371 --> 01:23:10,002
- You can't just leave by yourself. - You should go with the cameraman.

2332
01:23:10,002 --> 01:23:12,972
Seok Jin, you should take the cameraman with you.

2333
01:23:12,972 --> 01:23:13,981
Go.

2334
01:23:14,241 --> 01:23:17,252
Jee Seok Jin is out. Jee Seok Jin is out.

2335
01:23:17,252 --> 01:23:18,382
My goodness.

2336
01:23:18,382 --> 01:23:19,581
(What should I do?)

2337
01:23:19,581 --> 01:23:21,522
- You're not the Santa, right? - I'm not.

2338
01:23:23,121 --> 01:23:24,121
Here they come.

2339
01:23:24,121 --> 01:23:26,252
(At that time, the three of them meet at a dead end.)

2340
01:23:28,022 --> 01:23:29,821
- Jae Seok. - I got rid of him.

2341
01:23:31,262 --> 01:23:32,932
- I eliminated the Furious Santa. - What?

2342
01:23:33,691 --> 01:23:34,932
Did you eliminate him?

2343
01:23:35,701 --> 01:23:37,632
- You eliminated him? - Yes.

2344
01:23:38,071 --> 01:23:39,672
I eliminated the Furious Santa.

2345
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:40,772
Come on!

2346
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:42,672
What's wrong with him?

2347
01:23:42,672 --> 01:23:44,012
- What is it? - I eliminated Seok Jin.

2348
01:23:44,012 --> 01:23:47,241
I eliminated Seok Jin!

2349
01:23:48,081 --> 01:23:49,081
What?

2350
01:23:49,081 --> 01:23:50,111
(He's at a loss for words.)

2351
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:52,752
(There are no witnesses anyway.)

2352
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:54,382
(He starts acting intensely.)

2353
01:23:54,382 --> 01:23:56,281
- What? - I just got goosebumps.

2354
01:23:56,922 --> 01:23:58,052
What's wrong with you?

2355
01:23:59,052 --> 01:24:01,161
- What's going on with you two? - I just got goosebumps.

2356
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,161
(His acting confuses Haha.)

2357
01:24:02,762 --> 01:24:06,331
I eliminated the Furious Santa, and then you came.

2358
01:24:08,231 --> 01:24:09,731
What are you talking about?

2359
01:24:11,272 --> 01:24:13,071
- What's going on here? - Hold on.

2360
01:24:13,071 --> 01:24:15,972
- Both of them are suspects. - Hey, that's not it. Gosh.

2361
01:24:16,071 --> 01:24:18,571
- 1 of them has to be eliminated. - I'm 1 of the suspects?

2362
01:24:18,672 --> 01:24:20,172
I'm one of the suspects?

2363
01:24:20,512 --> 01:24:21,512
You are.

2364
01:24:21,512 --> 01:24:23,111
(You're the prime suspect.)

2365
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:26,312
- Hey, you. You come here. - I can't believe you.

2366
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:27,382
(You come here, Kwang Soo.)

2367
01:24:27,382 --> 01:24:28,682
(He grabs Kwang Soo's collar.)

2368
01:24:28,682 --> 01:24:30,081
Hey, you. Don't move.

2369
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:31,522
You.

2370
01:24:32,252 --> 01:24:34,092
- Haha, get him. - Let go of me.

2371
01:24:34,092 --> 01:24:35,661
- Eliminate him. - Hey, listen to me.

2372
01:24:35,661 --> 01:24:38,161
Hold on. Let me show you this.

2373
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:39,661
- Gosh, you... - I wasn't going to show you this.

2374
01:24:39,661 --> 01:24:41,701
- Gosh, I caught... - I'll just show you this.

2375
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:43,331
(Will it be a crucial hint that will back up his argument?)

2376
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:46,772
"The Furious Santas and assistants are shorter than 190cm."

2377
01:24:46,772 --> 01:24:47,772
Let me see.

2378
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:51,411
(Actually, as for this hint,)

2379
01:24:52,142 --> 01:24:56,212
(Kwang Soo made it himself a while ago.)

2380
01:24:56,212 --> 01:24:59,411
(Is this a skill of his experience? How far will he go to cheat?)

2381
01:25:01,481 --> 01:25:04,052
- I'm taller than 190cm. - Is that so?

2382
01:25:04,052 --> 01:25:06,092
- Hey, mister. - Hold on a second.

2383
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:07,661
- Hey, hey, hey! - I told you I wasn't.

2384
01:25:07,661 --> 01:25:09,691
- No, no. - Have you gone mad?

2385
01:25:09,691 --> 01:25:11,262
- What's this? - No, just eliminate him.

2386
01:25:11,262 --> 01:25:12,791
- Hey! - Hold on.

2387
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:14,861
- What? - I got rid of Seok Jin.

2388
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:16,802
- I eliminated Seok Jin. - Hey, hey. Let go.

2389
01:25:16,802 --> 01:25:18,132
- Get his name tag now! - Let go of me.

2390
01:25:18,132 --> 01:25:19,831
- Do it now! - What is this?

2391
01:25:20,672 --> 01:25:22,241
(Why are Sung Hoon's hands on Haha' bag?)

2392
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:23,672
- I got him. - Hey!

2393
01:25:25,111 --> 01:25:27,581
(He pretends to help Haha get Jae Seok's name tag.)

2394
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:29,012
- Get his name tag now! - Let go of me.

2395
01:25:29,012 --> 01:25:31,882
(He goes after Haha's bag.)

2396
01:25:33,411 --> 01:25:34,882
- Get it. Get it! - You come here.

2397
01:25:34,882 --> 01:25:36,081
(He took...)

2398
01:25:36,081 --> 01:25:37,081
(Haha's bag?)

2399
01:25:37,081 --> 01:25:38,791
- What just happened? - Get it. Get it!

2400
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:40,491
(As soon as he gets the bag, Sung Hoon starts running.)

2401
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:41,991
- I eliminated him. - Hey, Sung Hoon!

2402
01:25:43,392 --> 01:25:45,991
(What is wrong with him?)

2403
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:49,701
(He runs into the darkness after taking Haha's bag.)

2404
01:25:52,432 --> 01:25:56,371
(He was the second assistant.)

2405
01:25:56,541 --> 01:26:00,741
(The reason for choosing Haha is finally revealed.)

2406
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:03,382
(His target has been Haha from the start.)

2407
01:26:04,512 --> 01:26:07,852
(Forget about bromance. It was an act for this moment.)

2408
01:26:07,852 --> 01:26:08,981
What? What is this?

2409
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:11,392
(Sung Hoon! Where are you going?)

2410
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:13,752
Rip off his name tag. Rip it off.

2411
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,522
- He... - I got his name tag.

2412
01:26:15,522 --> 01:26:17,022
(When Haha is in a daze,)

2413
01:26:17,022 --> 01:26:20,491
(Kwang Soo holds Haha's hand and eliminates Jae Seok's name tag.)

2414
01:26:21,602 --> 01:26:23,802
(It happened in a split second.)

2415
01:26:24,472 --> 01:26:25,802
- What was that? - What is this?

2416
01:26:25,831 --> 01:26:27,002
- He... - Why did you eliminate me?

2417
01:26:27,002 --> 01:26:28,871
He just took my bag.

2418
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:31,741
- What he did threw me off. - Why did you eliminate me?

2419
01:26:32,172 --> 01:26:33,741
Why did you remove my name tag?

2420
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:35,611
I didn't. He did that!

2421
01:26:36,111 --> 01:26:37,781
I ripped off his name tag while holding your hand.

2422
01:26:37,781 --> 01:26:39,882
(Kwang Soo removed Jae Seok's name tag with Haha's hand.)

2423
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:42,581
- Why did you do that? - He did that!

2424
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:43,682
Hey, you!

2425
01:26:43,682 --> 01:26:44,691
(Both Haha and Jae Seok are out.)

2426
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:46,922
Go to prison. Get lost!

2427
01:26:47,022 --> 01:26:48,962
- Did you make this? - Get lost.

2428
01:26:48,962 --> 01:26:50,762
- You made this hint, didn't you? - Unbelievable.

2429
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:52,691
- Hey. You... - You made this hint, didn't you?

2430
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,632
I eliminated the Furious Santa.

2431
01:26:55,031 --> 01:26:56,161
You did that?

2432
01:26:56,161 --> 01:26:57,331
(Sung Hoon and Kwang Soo eliminated 2 members at once.)

2433
01:26:58,972 --> 01:27:01,302
(With Sung Hoon's help, they acquired...)

2434
01:27:01,302 --> 01:27:02,972
(Haha's cell phone too.)

2435
01:27:02,972 --> 01:27:04,272
We need Jae Seok's pants to finish the mission.

2436
01:27:04,842 --> 01:27:09,111
(Jae Seok, tight pants)

2437
01:27:10,212 --> 01:27:13,252
(The only item that remains is Jae Seok's pair of pants in prison.)

2438
01:27:14,922 --> 01:27:18,321
(The race will be over with Jae Seok's pants.)

2439
01:27:18,321 --> 01:27:21,661
What? No. I thought...

2440
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:24,562
it'd be rude to take off his pants without anything to cover him with.

2441
01:27:25,531 --> 01:27:27,191
I'll get his pants after covering him.

2442
01:27:27,191 --> 01:27:28,432
You prepared a lot.

2443
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:30,562
Jong Kook. Jong Kook and Ji Hyo.

2444
01:27:31,972 --> 01:27:34,672
(Furious civilians gather around with Jong Kook as their head.)

2445
01:27:35,502 --> 01:27:37,571
(What should we do?)

2446
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:38,672
I eliminated Seok Jin.

2447
01:27:38,672 --> 01:27:39,941
(He shares it voluntarily.)

2448
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:41,682
- What did you say? - I eliminated Seok Jin.

2449
01:27:41,682 --> 01:27:43,111
- What? - I got Seok Jin.

2450
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:46,882
(Sung Hoon backs off.)

2451
01:27:47,581 --> 01:27:50,151
Sung Hoon. Come here. Come with us.

2452
01:27:50,151 --> 01:27:52,592
- I'll go. - No, come with us. Why are you...

2453
01:27:52,592 --> 01:27:56,092
Why are you running away? Hold on.

2454
01:27:56,191 --> 01:27:57,291
Hey, Kwang Soo.

2455
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,432
(Kwang Soo runs at full speed.)

2456
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:02,201
- Kwang Soo. - I'm not the Santa! I'm really not!

2457
01:28:02,201 --> 01:28:04,302
(I see. You were the Santa.)

2458
01:28:06,172 --> 01:28:07,741
Gosh, I got caught.

2459
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:09,041
(Sung Hoon didn't get far.)

2460
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:10,371
Ji Hyo, get his name tag. Get it!

2461
01:28:10,371 --> 01:28:12,041
- I'm sorry, Sung Hoon. - Get his name tag!

2462
01:28:12,041 --> 01:28:13,041
(He's surrounded.)

2463
01:28:15,581 --> 01:28:16,581
We got it.

2464
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:18,882
(In the end, Chi Yeul eliminates him.)

2465
01:28:18,882 --> 01:28:19,981
I got it!

2466
01:28:21,422 --> 01:28:23,222
I got it! Right?

2467
01:28:23,222 --> 01:28:25,691
(Sung Hoon, the assistant, is out.)

2468
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:27,962
- He's so strong. - He really is strong.

2469
01:28:27,962 --> 01:28:29,392
(Now, only Kwang Soo remains.)

2470
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:33,592
(Team Civilian will win if Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

2471
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:36,432
Where's the prison?

2472
01:28:36,432 --> 01:28:37,432
Where is it?

2473
01:28:37,731 --> 01:28:42,672
(He manages to ditch Jong Kook after running at full speed.)

2474
01:28:45,741 --> 01:28:46,772
Kwang Soo.

2475
01:28:46,772 --> 01:28:48,581
(Where did Kwang Soo go?)

2476
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:53,182
(Is no one in there?)

2477
01:28:56,182 --> 01:28:57,222
Where is the prison?

2478
01:28:57,222 --> 01:28:58,252
(Whispering)

2479
01:29:00,222 --> 01:29:02,791
(He finds out where the prison is located.)

2480
01:29:04,392 --> 01:29:05,392
(He advances into prison.)

2481
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:06,791
What's going on? What is it?

2482
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:08,602
(He just needs to steal Jae Seok's pants.)

2483
01:29:08,602 --> 01:29:10,201
- What's going on with him? - Behind you!

2484
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:12,672
(Grabbing)

2485
01:29:12,672 --> 01:29:14,272
(Ripping it off)

2486
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:18,371
(Jong Kook who was hiding under the desk removes his name tag.)

2487
01:29:18,371 --> 01:29:20,041
Behind you. Behind you!

2488
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:21,642
(What? What just happened?)

2489
01:29:21,642 --> 01:29:22,642
Okay.

2490
01:29:25,312 --> 01:29:26,651
- He's the assistant. - Who eliminated him?

2491
01:29:26,651 --> 01:29:29,581
- I can't believe I'm doing this. - What are you doing?

2492
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:32,592
- What are you doing? Wait. - Hold him, Seok Jin. Hold him.

2493
01:29:32,592 --> 01:29:35,722
- This is what Kwang Soo is after. - Why did you...

2494
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:37,791
I should hide under the table.

2495
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:39,661
- He'll hide under there. - Okay.

2496
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:40,691
(He'll probably come here.)

2497
01:29:43,502 --> 01:29:48,302
(Clueless of this, Kwang Soo walked toward Jong Kook on his own.)

2498
01:29:48,472 --> 01:29:49,672
- My gosh. - Okay.

2499
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:52,241
- There's nothing we can do now. - What are you doing?

2500
01:29:52,241 --> 01:29:53,411
- It's Kwang Soo. - He's the Santa.

2501
01:29:53,411 --> 01:29:55,081
- Why are you taking off his pants? - What are you doing?

2502
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:56,981
- He's the Furious Santa. - What are you doing?

2503
01:29:56,981 --> 01:29:58,411
- What are you doing? - Answer me.

2504
01:29:58,611 --> 01:30:01,481
The couple who completed the final mission after uncovering...

2505
01:30:01,481 --> 01:30:03,651
the secret is So Min and Chi Yeul.

2506
01:30:03,951 --> 01:30:05,791
- What? - It's So Min and Chi Yeul.

2507
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:07,321
(So Min and Chi Yeul eliminated 2 assistants.)

2508
01:30:07,321 --> 01:30:09,161
- Really? - You eliminated two assistants.

2509
01:30:09,262 --> 01:30:12,132
The present will go to Chi Yeul and So Min.

2510
01:30:12,892 --> 01:30:15,861
(Chi Yeul and So Min, the winners, will receive the present.)

2511
01:30:15,861 --> 01:30:17,132
Thank you.

01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:22,472
As for Seok Jin and Kwang Soo's penalty,

2514
01:30:22,502 --> 01:30:24,312
- we'll discuss it first. - Yes, let's do that.

2515
01:30:24,312 --> 01:30:26,512
- We shouldn't make this short. - Come on.

2516
01:30:26,512 --> 01:30:28,281
- It'd be a shame. - What are you planning to give us?

2517
01:30:28,281 --> 01:30:29,741
- By the way... - I'll be anxious for a week.

2518
01:30:29,741 --> 01:30:32,151
- Let's do it after the New Year. - Let us sleep without worries.

2519
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,151
This is my point. Why were you furious?

2520
01:30:34,151 --> 01:30:36,781
Soo Young and Sung Hoon...

2521
01:30:36,981 --> 01:30:39,092
- will face the penalty. - Right.

2522
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,852
This is your punishment for using me twice.

2523
01:30:41,222 --> 01:30:43,222
- I'll accept the punishment then. - Okay.

2524
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:47,191
Thank you so much for your support throughout 2018.

2525
01:30:47,231 --> 01:30:49,331
We will see you in 2019.

2530
01:30:59,772 --> 01:31:02,981

2531
01:31:03,012 --> 01:31:04,382
Happy New Year.

2532
01:31:04,382 --> 01:31:06,512
