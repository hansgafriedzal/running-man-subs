(This is what you were feeling.)

18
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,660

No, they didn't. They didn't.

92
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,450

I brought two pairs of underpants.

101

bring two pairs of underpants.

104
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,470

- I need two pairs of underwear. - Just in case.

111
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,320
- Should I wear them too? - Yes.

112
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,620

- What? - Is it something else?

(You might go home late today.)

119

That's the worst.

122
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,300
I'd rather get the water bomb.

123
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,570
Please.

124
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,840
Since the name is Random Tour,

125
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,540

Why are we wearing blindfolds?

130
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,260
(They'll play a game and divide into teams.)

131
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,360
- At least my eyes are warm. - I can't see anything.

132
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,290
- This is fun. - What should we do now?

133

- What? Lie down on our backs? - Lie down?

137
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,470
Who would lie down on this cold ground even if it's for the team?

138
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,010
- Who would lie down? - Do you think so?

139
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,580
- Lying down on our back is weird. - Why would we lie down?

140
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,800

The camera crew asked you guys to slightly move back.

144
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,860
- Someone will do that. - My gosh.

145
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,230

148
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,800
(Bumping)

149
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,000
- I'm going to lie down. - What's this?

150
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,070

153
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Hey!

154
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,510

- Are you ready? - Yes.

157
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,160
1, 2, 3.

158
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,450
(Should I sit? Stand up? No, let's just lie down.)

159
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:46,460
(I'm going to stay up.)

(The teams aren't decided as it's 4 to 3 to 1.)

163
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,530
- It's cold. - I didn't choose to lie down.

164
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,640
(He struggles in pain.)

165
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,870
I didn't lie down.

166
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,070
Don't sit down. I'm sitting down.

167
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,810
I'm lying down. Gosh, it's cold.

168
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,440
Choose whether you'll keep your positions or change.

169
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,280
(Should I sit down?)

170
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,380
- It's cold! - Make your final decisions.

171
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,450
1, 2, 3.

172
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,120
(What kind of teams will they form?)

173
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,950
All right.

174
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,220
(The members are divided into 3 to 3 to 2.)

175
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,260
Take off your blindfolds.

176
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,230
(So Min, Jae Seok, and Seok Jin, who stood up, make a team.)

177
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,600
There are people who got down?

178
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
- Se Chan. - Jong Kook.

179
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,760
(Jong Kook and Se Chan, who sat down, make a team.)

180
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:27,770
My gosh, I like this.
(Jong Kook and Se Chan, who sat down, make a team.)

181
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,130
My gosh, I like this.

182
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,840
- I knew it. - Me too.

183
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,270
- It knew it'd be you. - Jong Kook.

184
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,470
- All right. - All right.

185
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,410
- Did you lie down? - Today won't be pretty.

186
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,110
I wasn't lying down.

187
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,610
Seriously. I didn't choose to lie down.

188
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,420
I was going to sit, but I felt that Jong Kook was sitting down.

189
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,780
Be on my team. You should've sat down.

190
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:48,790
I was trying my best to avoid teaming up with Jong Kook too.
Be on my team. You should've sat down.

191
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,790
I was trying my best to avoid teaming up with Jong Kook too.

192
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,690
- My gosh. Seriously. - How is this possible?

193
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,090
- My gosh. - Goodness.

194
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,960
You have divided into three teams randomly.

195
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,770
- You haven't teamed up for a while. - 3 to 3 to 2.

196
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,870
- It's been a while. - It's been so long.

197
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,540
I should give my swimming pants to Seok Jin later.

198
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,840
What would you say that? You should just keep them on.

199
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,610
- I think I'd be okay. - Hey, our team will probably lose.

200
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,840
- You're one to talk. - My teammates...

201
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,780
You know they like to drag each other down, right?

202
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,910
- Of course. - You know?

203
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,280
- I'm already feeling tired. - I'd never go down alone.

204
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,790
You're already acting like this servant.

205
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,950
- I'm carrying out my penalty. - You know...

206
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,660
You shouldn't be biased.

207
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,060
- What do you mean? - Let's travel like we're friends.

208
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,630
Okay. Jong Kook, I'll treat you like my friend.

209
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I'm sorry.

210
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,270
(When you said we could be friends, I went over the line.)

211
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,970
- Let me tell you this. - This is great.

212
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,840
- Se Chan, what's wrong with you? - That's the way to go, Se Chan.

213
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,470
- Keep that up. - We can travel "like" friends.

214
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,340
We won't actually be friends.

215
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
Seok Jin, why don't we treat each other like friends?

216
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,710
You jerk.

217
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,250
What?

218
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,780
(Random Tour Race with a group of friends starts.)

219
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,320
Ji Hyo, you...

220
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,360
- You sent me a photo. - What kind of photo?

221
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,460
She sent me a photo of a poster recruiting players for gateball.

222
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,330
Seriously.

223
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,060
- Hey. - It's the sport old people play.

224
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,030
I'm too young to be playing gateball.

225
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,340
I was told that there are a lot of people around your age.

226
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,670
(Ji Hyo is rooting for Seok Jin's new hobby.)

227
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,940
- Random Tour has begun. - Okay.

228
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,180
We're heading to our destination.

229
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,210
First, pick a team name, write it, and submit the paper to us.

230
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,780
I'll write it.

231
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,650
The name of our team will be The Old Man and the Sea.

232
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,160
- "The Old Man and the Sea"? - How about Between Friends?

233
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,060
Hey, who is the old man?

234
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,160
- Who do you think? - This is annoying.

235
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,730
- Take a wild guess. - Seriously.

236
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,600
The Old Man and the Sea.

237
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,330
- My goodness. - The team name...

238
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,400
Yu-So-Body.

239
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,500
"Yu-So-Body"?

240
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,200
- What about my name? - Yu-So-Body.

241
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,840
- You're the Body. - I'm the Body?

242
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,610
- Hey, - Yu-So-Body.

243
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,980
we're going to go with Yu-So-Body.

244
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,580
- Yu-So-Body. - That's a nice name.

245
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,150
- What's your team's name? - Between Friends.

246
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,350
- Between Friends. - Between Friends.

247
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,320
(Between... Between Friends?)

248
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,790
- Are you guys friends? - Of course, we are.

249
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,720
What is this?

250
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,460
Off-the-wall Love Triangle.

251
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,160
(Haha, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo's team is Off-the-wall Love Triangle.)

252
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,430
How does that sound?

253
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,100
Where are we going?

254
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,900
I can't see anything.

255
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,210
It's dark outside.

256
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,640
I can't wait.

257
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,910
Hold on.

258
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,810
Okay.

259
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,580
- What? - What is it?

260
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,380
We are at Incheon International Airport.

261
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,780
(Are we at Incheon International Airport?)

262
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,290
(Random Tour Bus enters Incheon International Airport.)

263
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,860
- For goodness' sake. - We must be going abroad.

264
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,560
- Are we at the airport? - We must be going abroad.

265
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,430
- Did you bring our passports? - Hey.

266
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,370
You should have told us if we were going abroad.

267
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,040
- Where are we going? - Don't suddenly drag us somewhere.

268
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,070
What is going on?

269
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,610
Are we really going abroad?

270
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,110
(Where are the members going?)

271
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,480
Are we really going abroad? I don't have luggage.

272
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,810
If we are going abroad...

273
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,280
Where are we going? Don't we need luggage?

274
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,650
- What is going on? - Are we really going abroad?

275
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,750
What is this?

276
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
What is this?

277
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,590
What is this? Look at this.

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,760
- What is that? - "Global Random Tour".

279
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,900
Are we really going abroad?

280
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Jakarta? Are we going to Jakarta?

281
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,000
Wait a minute. Are you out of your mind?

282
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,540
(There are names of cities...)

283
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,110
(and flight numbers written on the board.)

284
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,640
Is this really happening?

285
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,450
- Is this an overnight trip? - What is going on?

286
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,750
I don't have luggage. I have two underwear.

287
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,080
What is going on?

288
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,750
- Are we really going abroad? - Do you have our passports?

289
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,150
I will explain the real mission...

290
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,260
- of today's Random Tour. - What is going on?

291
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,760
This is unbelievable.

292
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,160
The real mission...

293
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,630
is the Global Random Tour with a big penalty on the line,

294
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,200
Departure upon Arrival.

295
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,370
- What? - Departure upon Arrival?

296
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,640
Global Random Tour requires a group of four people.

297
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,770
You must recruit travel mates who will join Random Tour.

298
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,610
As soon as the recruited travel mates arrive,

299
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,550
you can get on the next plane that is boarding.

300
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,810
(Get on the next plane that is boarding.)

301
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,350
- Finish your mission, and return. - Who'd go with us?

302
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,920
- Who would go? - You mean we must recruit people...

303
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,020
who will go on a trip abroad with us?

304
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,420
- That's ridiculous. - At this hour?

305
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,600
Who will suddenly go on a trip abroad?

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,530
You have a shoot for Running Man tomorrow as well anyway.

307
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,270
Wait for your guests to arrive,

308
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,440
and get on the next available flight.

309
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,940
Production crew, you are utter jerks.

310
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,470
This is insane.

311
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,080
We excluded flights that are headed to Europe and the States.

312
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,680
Do you see the "unavailable" stickers?

313
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,110
If there are no seats or time for the boarding procedures,

314
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,120
we will put a sticker next to the flight information.

315
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,090
(There are missions available wherever they go.)

316
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,420
(Global Random Tour)

317
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,390
There is a flight to Daegu.

318
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,860
- There is a flight to Daegu. - There is a flight to Busan.

319
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,060
There are domestic flights.

320
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,430
- There are domestic flights. - Busan.

321
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,770
Busan.

322
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,500
- Where is Khabarovsk? - I have no clue.

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,300
- Where is Khabarovsk? - Isn't it in Russia?

324
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,670
We don't necessary want our travel mates to arrive quickly.

325
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,180
If the next flight is for Singapore, we will have to fly for six hours.

326
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,110
Whom should I call?

327
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,980
So Min, do you have anyone to call?

328
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,050
- My dad. - Your dad?

329
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,050
Why would you call your dad?

330
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,890
They don't have to be famous, right?

331
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,120
It doesn't matter.

332
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,290
I will call someone who will be easy to travel with.

333
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,890
I will call a younger member.

334
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,300
Please split up and begin.

335
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,470
- Whom should we call? - Whom should we call?

336
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,100
Whom should we call? Hold on.

337
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,240
What can we say at this hour...

338
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,370
- to recruit someone? - What should I do?

339
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,740
What should I do? Hold on.

340
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,540
Call Keun Sik.

341
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,210
- Keun Sik will be available. - Keun Sik?

342
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,680
He would be asleep.

343
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,120
He isn't picking up. He would be asleep at this hour.

344
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,950
I am sure he is asleep.

345
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,150
(He isn't picking up.)

346
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:57,690
I received a text from Won Yun Jong just now.

347
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,220
- Who is that? - The bobsledder.

348
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,260
(Haha, thank you for narrating the documentary.)

349
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,130
(A bobsledder in the national team, Won Yun Jong)

350
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,570
Tell him to come.

351
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,040
Should I give him a call?

352
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,170
- Is he in Pyeongchang? - He must be in Pyeongchang.

353
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,610
He should rest after the games.

354
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,280
He can rest during the trip.

355
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,180
It will be impossible to rest.

356
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,550
Hold on. Who is available?

357
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,350
I have no one to call.

358
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,390
I have no one to call.

359
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,220
Hold on. Jong Kook, can I call someone younger?

360
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,360
Do that.

361
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,830
You and I are friends.

362
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,900
That's right.

363
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,860
Call someone younger so that we can be comfortable.

364
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,630
Call someone you can boss around.

365
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,300
How about Byung Jae? Do you know him?

366
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,570
- Who? - Yoo Byung Jae.

367
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,510
I know who he is. He has been on Running Man.

368
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,640
- Really? - Yes.

369
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,040
I will try calling him.

370
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,520
He wouldn't pick up at this hour.

371
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,390
- Hello? - Hello.

372
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,890
Byung Jae, what are you doing?

373
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
- I was asleep. - Were you asleep?

374
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,190
- Yes. - You are awake now.

375
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,560
Yes. You called me.

376
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,460
That's right. Hey, listen.

377
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,300
(How can I make him come?)

378
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,470
Have you done something wrong to Jong Kook?

379
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,370
- Who? - Jong Kook.

380
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,610
What do you mean?

381
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,480
Jong Kook talked about you.

382
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,280
Have you worked with Jong Kook?

383
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,050
I have only worked with him on an episode of Running Man.

384
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,750
Did you do something wrong then? Jong Kook talked about you.

385
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,490
I received his number, but...

386
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,230
You never contacted him, right?

387
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,360
No, but I received his number.

388
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,730
Jong Kook hates things like that.

389
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,670
You should come here...

390
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,770
and talk it out with Jong Kook.

391
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,010
We are at Incheon International Airport.

392
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,940
You should bring your passport...

393
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,440
and get rid of bad blood between you and Jong Kook.

394
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,110
You want me to bring my passport?

395
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,880
Yes. Jong Kook...

396
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,620
You want me to bring my passport to make up with Jong Kook.

397
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,380
It's necessary...

398
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,650
because he is worried that you will run away.

399
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,570
He wants to get a hold of your passport.

400
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,160
He has a weird personality.

401
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,190
(My goodness.)

402
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:16,200
He doesn't have a weird personality,
(My goodness.)

403
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,700
He doesn't have a weird personality,

404
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,200
but he can be hot-headed.

405
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,210
I don't know if he will pick up.
but he can be hot-headed.

406
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,730
I don't know if he will pick up.

407
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,470
I don't think he will.

408
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,740
Hold on. Hello?

409
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,410
Hello, Jae Seok.

410
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,010
Hey, hey, hey, jerk.

411
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,710
(Is he Heo Kyeong Hwan?)

412
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,820
(Groaning)

413
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,990
- Are you sleeping? - Kyeong Hwan.

414
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,850
- Yes? - What are you doing right now?

415
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:41,860
(It's 6am.)
- Yes? - What are you doing right now?

416
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,020
(It's 6am.)

417
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,620
What? I should wake up now.

418
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,290
Kyeong Hwan, I am sorry...

419
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,330
for calling so suddenly.

420
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,100
(He suddenly says Kyeong Hwan's popular phrase.)

421
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,200
(He goes along with it.)

422
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,530
- Kyeong Hwan. - Yes?

423
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,470
Don't be surprised. Do you have...

424
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,170
any plans for today?

425
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,140
I will make plans now.

426
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,340
- What did he say? - "I will make plans now."

427
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,940
(We are glad to hear that.)

428
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,990
- That's great. You are free. - Kyeong Hwan.

429
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,180
Kyeong Hwan.

430
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,210
(She suddenly talks to him.)

431
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,950
(Kyeong Hwan.)

432
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,020
Kyeong Hwan. Hello, I am Jeon So Min.

433
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,090
(Kyeong Hwan. Hello, I am Jeon So Min.)

434
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,490
- Hello, So Min. - Hello.

435
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,160
- We have never met. - You have never met.

436

00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,360
I should let her meet me.

439
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,230
I am glad to hear that.

440
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,970
- Kyeong Hwan. - Yes?

441
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,040
You said exactly what I wanted to say.

442
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,070
Kyeong Hwan, I am sorry,

443
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,310
but please don't be taken aback.

444
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,440
Can you come to Incheon International Airport?

445
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,190
Where do you live?

446
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,550

450
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,350
I am putting on my pants.

451
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,790
- What are you doing? - He is putting on his pants.

452
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,930
I am putting on my pants.

454
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,960
Would it be okay?

455
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960

Shorry is older than me.

Don't worry.

Do I look like I have work?

488
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,410
You don't have any plans for today and tomorrow, right?

489
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,780
Then pick up your passport, and come to Incheon International Airport.

490
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,480
(It's settled.)

491
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,880

I'll try to walk slowly.

1343

Should we play a game?

1370
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,460
We have nothing to do anyway.

1371
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,130
The winner can take the loser's step counter for 10 seconds.

It'd make the team's count go up as well.

Why is it a female's voice?
