1
00:00:10,046 --> 00:00:12,780
- Hello. Hi. - Hi.

2
00:00:12,782 --> 00:00:14,255
Haha, you should dance now.

3
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:16,125
Haha, you should dance now.

4
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:17,380
Haha, come on.

5
00:00:17,387 --> 00:00:18,725
(Humming a melody)

6
00:00:18,822 --> 00:00:20,425
Haha, what's that outfit?

7
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,390
Haha, my gosh. What's up with your outfit?

8
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:25,120
My gosh, his outfit is terrible.

9
00:00:25,128 --> 00:00:26,535
(He can't understand the outfit.)

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,930
Unbelievable.

11
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,000
- Did he wear that on purpose? - No, no.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,300
- When Jong Kook saw Haha's outfit, - My gosh.

13
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,030
he seriously scolded him.

14
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,300
- I... - He really did.

15
00:00:36,306 --> 00:00:38,840
I understand that Haha looks up to me,

16
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:41,640
but I had no idea he'd wear my Turbo outfit.

17
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,415
(Jong Kook, please keep your eyes on me.)

18
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:45,640
He can't make it obvious that he's brown-nosing Jong Kook.

19
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:48,050
Actually, the contestants on "High School Rapper"...

20
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,050
- wear this kind of outfit a lot. - That's true.

21
00:00:50,053 --> 00:00:53,290
- People wear it on that show. - But he's not a high school rapper.

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:56,065
- He wants to look young. - He's not in high school.

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,165
My dream is becoming a high school student.

24
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:01,990
Did you see his hair earlier? A lot of his hair went gray.

25
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:03,730
(That dream isn't possible.)

26
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,300
- Stop it. - That's enough.

27
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,600
- Stop it. You might beat him up. - Listen.

28
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:08,300
- We didn't start today's filming. - I thought...

29
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,275
he played a game with flour. His hair went white.

30
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,040
- Hey, Se Chan. - What is it?

31
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:17,040
- You're copying Jong Kook now. - I am?

32
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,040
- I am? - Your outfit is black too.

33
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:20,655
- You should wear your own outfit. - So Min, you come here.

34
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:23,080
- Unbelievable. - The 4 of you make 1 team.

35
00:01:23,086 --> 00:01:24,720
The 4 of you make 1 team.

36
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,920
- This is great. - I'm in.

37
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:27,490
- That's right. - I love this team.

38
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,520
- I like it. - This is great.

39
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,865
I'm the only girl.

40
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:33,165
How could she care about that now?

41
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:35,990
- Se Chan's outfit is neat. - I like this team.

42
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:39,730
Come on. Look at Jin Young.

43
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,745
- I looked at her earlier. - Look at me.

44
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,145
- You must look at me. - I looked at you a lot earlier.

45
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,415
I did.

46
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:48,510
- Only she can control Jong Kook. - I agree.

47
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,415
They make a great couple.

48
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,850
Kwang Soo went to a hair salon because we teased that he was ugly.

49
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,110
- Right. He got his hair done. - Where?

50
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,110
Where?

51
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,380
(I don't see any difference.)

52
00:01:57,387 --> 00:01:58,580
What do you mean?

53
00:01:58,588 --> 00:01:59,580
(He's utterly disappointed.)

54
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:00,865
How is it different?

55
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:03,665
What do you mean? You should see the difference straight away.

56
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,290
- I... - It's obvious.

57
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:07,030
I thought you were sleeping right before you came here.

58
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,390
- What? No. My hair is different. - You weren't sleeping?

59
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:10,460
I'm not wearing a hat.

60
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:14,405
Now, you do resemble Han Gi Beom.

61
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,630
- What's wrong with you? - You know who he is, right?

62
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,940
- He's the basketball player. - What's your deal?

63
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,275
You stupid beggar.

64
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,410
- Hey, why is he cursing so much? - You do resemble him.

65
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,215
This is ridiculous, but why is this so funny?

66
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:28,555
(He earns another nickname out of the blue.)

67
00:02:28,685 --> 00:02:31,820
Let me recap regarding the stickers.

68
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,120
Oh, right. I forgot about the stickers.

69
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,320
Only two people, Jin Young and Jong Kook,

70
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,395
earned the Luxury Stickers two weeks in a row.

71
00:02:37,527 --> 00:02:39,320
- Good for them. - They look like a couple.

72
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:40,805
Their outfits look similar.

73
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,290
2 people who earned the Shuddering Stickers 2 weeks in a row...

74
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,200
- are Sang Yeob and So Min. - My gosh.

75
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,560
- It's just the two of us? - We're like a couple too.

76
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,030
It's just the two of us.

77
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:51,715
Since it's beautiful springtime, we decided to shoot outdoors.

78
00:02:52,142 --> 00:02:55,570
The race begins now. Tear off each other's name tags.

79
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,670
(Remove the name tags now.)

80
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,310
- What? - What's going on?

81
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:59,340
What's this?

82
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,380
(Remove the name tags from the start?)

83
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:01,750
(The Name Tag Elimination begins in the midst of their confusion.)

84
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,150
- Why? - Why?

85
00:03:03,153 --> 00:03:05,450
(The Name Tag Elimination begins in the midst of their confusion.)

86
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,590
- Why? Why? - What are we doing this?

87
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,320
(Jin Young is the 1st member to get a name tag.)

88
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:11,320
Why?

89
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:15,535
(Sang Yeob gets Jin Young's name tag when she's perplexed.)

90
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:20,135
- Hey. Hey. - Did you get it?

91
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:22,370
(Fast Han Na gets Slow Seok Jin's name tag first.)

92
00:03:22,372 --> 00:03:23,940
Why is she so quick?

93
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
(Can you give me your name tag?)

94
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,715
- My gosh, Han Na. - Hey, Han Na.

95
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,340
Come here. You. You!

96
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:32,815
- You. - Go. I need to get the name tag.

97
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,225
Get hers.

98
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,450
(Kwang Soo tries to get Da Hee's name tag.)

99
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:39,720
Hey, Kwang Soo!

100
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,795
(Kwang Soo tries to get Da Hee's name tag.)

101
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,620
Hey, Kwang Soo!

102
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:46,090
- You... - I got Da Hee's.

103
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,090
(The race ends.)

104
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,930
- I got two name tags. - Unbelievable.

105
00:03:48,932 --> 00:03:50,035
(He's feeling confident.)

106
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:52,105
(The heat of the race doesn't subdue.)

107
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,575
(It's not over. Give me back my name tag.)

108
00:03:57,073 --> 00:04:00,040
- Did you lose yours? - I lost mine. Look.

109
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,310
(What was this surprise game for?)

110
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:03,815
Raise your hands if you tore off someone's name tags.

111
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,510
- Sang Yeob has the most name tags. - Yes.

112
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:09,050
- The first member to remove one... - It's Jin Young.

113
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,055
was Jin Young. Play rock-paper-scissors to form teams.

114
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:12,750
We'll form a team?

115
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:14,825
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to break into teams.

116
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,995
- I'm really bad at it. - Jin Young.

117
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:18,620
(If it's a 6-on-6, team match,)

118
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:21,735
(they must pick Jong Kook first.)

119
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,530
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

120
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,400
(Jin Young wins.)

121
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,760
- I knew it. - I choose Jong Kook!

122
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,870
(She picks him right away.)

123
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:29,870
(I see.)

124
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:30,945
Go. Go now.

125
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,785
- Are you happy? You're happy? - Yes, I'm happy.

126
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,915
- Great. - He said...

127
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:37,785
he's happy.

128
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:40,610
- I have to choose too, right? - Yes.

129
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:41,725
He said he's happy.

130
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,220
Haha.

131
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,280
(Haha, join me.)

132
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,495
- Me? - Yes.

133
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:49,290
- Why me? - Come here. Come.

134
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:51,220
- Jin Young, please pick me. Please. - Seriously?

135
00:04:51,227 --> 00:04:52,995
Please pick me. I will treat you with respect.

136
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,965
- Jin Young, pick me too. - Play rock-paper-scissors again.

137
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,530
- Sang Yeob. - Play rock-paper-scissors again.

138
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,500
(For some intelligible reason, he chooses Haha to defeat Jong Kook.)

139
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:00,930
- Listen. - What's his deal all of a sudden?

140
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,705
Don't we keep picking members?

141
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,740
- Should I pick guys first? - That's better.

142
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,040
- Yes. Se Chan? - Se Chan?

143
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,085
- You can do that. - We pick Se Chan.

144
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,455
- Okay. - Okay!

145
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,385
Okay!

146
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,210
- Hey. - I...

147
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:16,920
Hey, let me make my escape. You're in on this too?

148
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
- Be quiet. - Se Chan.

149
00:05:18,087 --> 00:05:20,225
- I was joking. - Pick the dirty one.

150
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:23,490
- Kwang Soo. - Why me?

151
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:26,090
(No way.)

152
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:27,130
Let's play dirty!

153
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,990
- We need Kwang Soo. - Let's play dirty.

154
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:31,200
- This is Team Daema Island. - Let's go with that.

155
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,730
They will be Team Daema Island with Ji Hyo.

156
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:35,030
- We have to choose someone. - We need to pick.

157
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,915
- After that, we'll pick again. - Jae Seok.

158
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:40,870
- Hold on. - Okay.

159
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:43,345
- Hey, hold on. - Why are you happy?

160
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,610
- Jae Seok, you're with us. - The game is over.

161
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:47,085
It's over now.

162
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,350
We got Jae Seok and Jong Kook.

163
00:05:49,352 --> 00:05:51,020
- We won. - It's over.

164
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,320
Get ready to get beaten up.

165
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,850
- Fight physically and verbally. - Hey, this is...

166
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:55,120
- Get ready to suffer. - You can choose now.

167
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,925
(You'd better watch out.)

168
00:05:57,026 --> 00:06:00,430
- That's right. - They're like the shadows.

169
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,035
- I'll do my best to serve you. - Hey.

170
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:04,600
- Congratulations on escaping. - We'll be physical and verbal.

171
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,975
- It's over now. - Can I choose now?

172
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:08,405
So Min.

173
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:10,200
(What?)

174
00:06:10,206 --> 00:06:11,940
- I pick her. - Why me? Why?

175
00:06:11,941 --> 00:06:13,500
I need to do well this week.

176
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,370
I can't get a Shuddering Sticker this week.

177
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:16,815
You are in the same team as Sang Yeob.

178
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,480
- Why are you reacting this way? - Sang Yeob is in your team.

179
00:06:19,482 --> 00:06:20,680
Sang Yeob will protect you.

180
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,310
- I will protect you. - That's right.

181
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:24,620
I am tired of Sang Yeob now.

182
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,825
(I am tired of Sang Yeob now.)

183
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:29,365
How did you get tired of him so soon?

184
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:31,835
That's so sudden.

185
00:06:31,961 --> 00:06:34,105
- He didn't do anything. - I didn't do anything.

186
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,890
We will have members who pay dirty. Lee Da Hee.

187
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,630
- All right! - Me?

188
00:06:38,635 --> 00:06:40,105
We will show you the dirtiest play.

189
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:41,275
Ji Hyo.

190
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:44,175
- Yes! - Is this like a love triangle?

191
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:46,040
I am sorry, sir.

192
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,740
Han Na, come here.

193
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:51,010
(Sang Yeob makes the strangest team by recruiting an eccentric member.)

194
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:52,355
This isn't bad.

195
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,855
- We have no other choice. - Let's go.

196
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:59,595
(Jin Young's Team and Sang Yeob's Team)

197
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,590
You will have a team competition today...

198
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,490
for Steal House and Get Out Race.

199
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:06,990
(Steal House and Get Out Race)

200
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,735
- Get Out? - Get Out?

201
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,530
There will be three rounds in total.

202
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,435
For each round, the winning team gets a Luxury Sticker,

203
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:16,570
and the losing team gets a Shuddering Sticker.

204
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,040
Let's get a Luxury Sticker today.

205
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,140
- We have to get it. - We have to get a Luxury Sticker.

206
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:23,610
The winning team also gets Get Out! Time to Steal...

207
00:07:23,613 --> 00:07:25,685
in which they have a chance to get more Luxury Stickers.

208
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,655
Time to Steal?

209
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,625
In five minutes,

210
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,090
the winning team can steal an object from the losing team.

211
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,250
(The winning team can steal an object from the losing team.)

212
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,420
(They can steal anything in the house.)

213
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,090
If they succeed to move the object to their house,

214
00:07:40,096 --> 00:07:42,005
they get another Luxury Sticker.

215
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,535
If they fail, they get a Shuddering Sticker.

216
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:46,835
However,

217
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:50,600
the object you steal must be bigger than the previous one.

218
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:55,170
(The object you steal must be bigger than the previous one.)

219
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,510
- It must be bigger. - It must be bigger.

220
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:59,840
You don't steal with the other team inside the house.

221
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,925
You get five minutes to steal an object.

222
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,225
Okay.

223
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,080
There is a hidden rule.

224
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:08,050
Each team will now choose three objects inside the house...

225
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,835
that are likely to get stolen by the other team...

226
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,360
and compile the Shuddering List.

227
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,930
If the other team steals an object on that list,

228
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:17,700
they get a Shuddering Sticker.

229
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,905
- Three objects. - This is hard.

230
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:21,100
It's a counterattack.

231
00:08:21,104 --> 00:08:23,170
- This is hard. - I know.

232
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:26,200
It's a game of wits.

233
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,540
Now, choose 1 of the 2 Running Houses,

234
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:32,210
and write down three objects on the Shuddering List.

235
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,310
- Really? - Okay.

236
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:37,085
- Let's choose the nearer one. - We choose House A.

237
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:39,650
What? That's ridiculous.

238
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:42,250
We wanted House A as well.

239
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:43,620
We chose first.

240
00:08:43,626 --> 00:08:45,860
- Our team has senior members. - That's right.

241
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,095
Please be understanding.

242
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,630
Gosh, they can't do that just because they are old.

243
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:50,960
- Please be understanding. - Who are you?

244
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:53,730
What do you mean? I am the youngest member.

245
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,800
Must you ask? I am the youngest member.

246
00:08:54,804 --> 00:08:56,270
Wake up. You had better be on your guard today.

247
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:57,740
(The bold, youngest member enters House A.)

248
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,275
How many objects do we choose?

249
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:00,885
- 3? - 3.

250
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,445
There is a doll. Shouldn't it be on the list?

251
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:05,285
This doll.

252
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,725
We need to beware of trash cans.

253
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:10,125
A table.

254
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:12,295
The first object can be...

255
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:13,320
- Jae Seok. - How about a window?

256
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:15,465
- The first object can be a door. - How about a window?

257
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,990
- There is no bigger object. - That sliding door is heavy.

258
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:19,695
- It's heavy. Someone will get hurt. - It's heavy.

259
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,565
Does the curtain rod count?

260
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,660
- The curtain rod? - They measure an object's length.

261
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:26,235
Do you work in interior design?

262
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:28,845
- Do you work in interior design? - They have a business.

263
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:30,540
Are you the chief?

264
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,840
Yes, I am the chief.

265
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:33,810
(Ji Hyo designs a place of happiness.)

266
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,840
- I see. - This is...

267
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:38,340
I think a door is a good idea.

268
00:09:38,347 --> 00:09:39,540
- A door. - A door.

269
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:40,580
It won't occur to them.

270
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,210
Will they be able to remove it in five minutes?

271
00:09:43,219 --> 00:09:44,855
You know,

272
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,865
we are only thinking about the game. This house is rented.

273
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:49,920
- It's a damage to property. - It's okay.

274
00:09:49,926 --> 00:09:51,790
- We can put it back. - We can put it back.

275
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:54,260
- It's okay. - The owner will be taken aback.

276
00:09:54,263 --> 00:09:56,490
The production crew paid accordingly,

277
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:57,660
so the owner should understand.

278
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,060
Who are you to decide?

279
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:00,705
Don't tell the owner what they should understand.

280
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:03,205
Put yourself in the owner's shoes.

281
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,115
A variety show comes for a shoot...

282
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:07,670
and removes the door of your house.

283
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:08,870
- How would you feel? - How would you feel?

284
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:10,010
(Put yourself in the owner's shoes.)

285
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:11,540
Then I would ask for an additional 100 dollars.

286
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:14,980
(Then I would ask for an additional 100 dollars.)

287
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:16,380
It's something...

288
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,780
- the production crew can work out. - Really?

289
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:20,020
Yes, we should negotiate.

290
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,650
- It's not a big damage. - No, it's not.

291
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:22,990
It's not a damage.

292
00:10:22,992 --> 00:10:24,860
Receiving more money will make the owner feel better.

293
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:26,320
Of course. The owner will feel much better.

294
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:28,730
- Stop being so intimidating. - What did I do?

295
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,465
You keep doing this.

296
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,835
Seriously.

297
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,930
(He flexes his muscles in an intimidating way.)

298
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,370
- Why did you take off your jacket? - It's a bit small for me.

299
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:39,915
You became strange ever since you joined "Mom's Diary".

300
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,645
- What's wrong with you? - What did I do?

301
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,545
I plan to become a problematic son.

302
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:45,155
(That's my goal.)

303
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:46,955
For goodness' sake.

304
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,150
The members of the other team are small-minded.

305
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,980
Their decision will be affected by their small minds.

306
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:53,220
- Hey. - There are more ladies there.

307
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,325
It takes a small-minded person to know a small-minded person.

308
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,795
- Seok Jin. - What?

309
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,995
Give us your insight.

310
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:00,020
- In my opinion... - He is small-minded.

311
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,160
It takes a small-minded person...

312
00:11:01,163 --> 00:11:02,690
to know a small-minded person.

313
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:04,030
I will tell you what I would take.

314
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:06,005
The first object I would take is a blanket.

315
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:07,430
- A blanket. - It's light...

316
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:09,505
- and long. - That's right.

317
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,070
- I would definitely take a blanket. - You are small-minded.

318
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:15,770
I think they would take a mattress.

319
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:17,040
Or a blanket.

320
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,885
(Seok Jin was right.)

321
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:21,710
- A window. - A curtain.

322
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:23,450
- A window. - A window.

323
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,850
We can take a window.

324
00:11:24,854 --> 00:11:26,120
- A window. - That's right.

325
00:11:26,122 --> 00:11:28,590
- They wouldn't think about it. - No, they wouldn't.

326
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:30,190
- A window. - A window.

327
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,820
- It's easy to remove a window. - It's a must.

328
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:34,090
- They would take this. - Yes, they would.

329
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,260
We need to be careful. A curtain rod is easy to remove.

330
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,160
It's very big.

331
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,375
(Their thoughts are the same.)

332
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:42,200
If they are thinking about stealing big objects,

333
00:11:42,204 --> 00:11:43,530
- we need them on the list. - I will visit them...

334
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:45,870
and see what they are doing.

335
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,070
That's a good idea.

336
00:11:47,076 --> 00:11:48,610
- I will drop them a visit. - Are you serious?

337
00:11:48,611 --> 00:11:50,140
- There is no point in worrying. - Drop them a visit.

338
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:51,785
Stay here. I will be back.

339
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,510
- Be brazen, okay? - Okay.

340
00:11:53,516 --> 00:11:55,080
Ask them what they will steal.

341
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,150
(Fast as the wind)

342
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:01,225
(Invisible as the air)

343
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:06,035
(He plans to take a peek and run away.)

344
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,005
For goodness' sake.

345
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,200
You sure play dirty.

346
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:15,205
- Jae Seok! - I am not playing dirty.

347
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,970
He is the only member in that team...

348
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,575
- who plays dirty. - I am not playing dirty.

349
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:20,785
You should have tried to come quietly.

350
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,710
- No... - Since when were you here?

351
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:23,985
What do you mean?

352
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:27,925
I came here to borrow a spoon.

353
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,585
- Why would you borrow a spoon? - I want to eat noodles.

354
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,280
You eat noodles with chopsticks, not a spoon.

355
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:33,580
So this is your house.

356
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:35,890
Now that I am here, let me take a look inside.

357
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,090
- Where are you going? - Get out of the way.

358
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:39,790
- What do you think you are doing? - Go away.

359
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,090
Go away.

360
00:12:41,097 --> 00:12:42,830
- Go away. - I can't believe him.

361
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:44,805
- You are unbelievable. - What do you think you are doing?

362
00:12:44,934 --> 00:12:46,000
Get out of our house.

363
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,800
- Don't you know me? - What?

364
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,405
- I know you but... - Don't you know me?

365
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,445
I appear on TV.

366
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:54,140
Everyone here appears on TV.

367
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,570
Sweep the way for him.

368
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:56,910
- So Min, what are you doing? - I brought a spoon.

369
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,040
So Min, what are you doing?

370
00:12:58,047 --> 00:12:59,315
You can go now.

371
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:00,950
I was going to give him chopsticks.

372
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,050
Gosh, you are heartless.

373
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,225
I am sorry to ask,

374
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,755
but may I have dinner here?

375
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,890
Jae Seok.

376
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,165
Kick this beggar out.

377
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:11,465
You gave me a spoon.

378
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,765
- May I have dinner here? - Give me back the spoon.

379
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:16,260
(You can take a cleaning tool instead.)

380
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:18,200
- You are so annoying, So Min. - Leave.

381
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,560
- For goodness' sake. - Bye.

382
00:13:19,568 --> 00:13:20,775
(He fails spectacularly.)

383
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:23,330
We need to choose objects...

384
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,940
they are most likely to steal.

385
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,070
That's right.

386
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,270
- A window. - A window.

387
00:13:27,276 --> 00:13:30,340
- That's right. - That curtain rod is too long.

388
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:31,540
That curtain rod...

389
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,780
- It's bigger than any object. - It will be exhausting to move.

390
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:34,950
This curtain rod...

391
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,910
- It must be 7m long. - It's really big.

392
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,220
(There is a high chance they will steal the curtain rod.)

393
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,950
I think they will steal the curtain.

394
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:40,990
The curtain is more likely than a blanket.

395
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,450
- It's really long. Look at this. - I know.

396
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,760
Let's put that on the list.

397
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,420
- Let's add that. - That's a good idea.

398
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,405
- It's long. - It's longer than the sofa.

399
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,630
- Shall we take a picture of it? - Shall we?

400
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,960
- Let's take a picture of it. - Put vacuum cleaner on the list.

401
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,960
- All right. They will take it. - I think they will take it.

402
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:55,405
- Okay. - All right.

403
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:56,970
(House A's Shuddering List)

404
00:13:56,972 --> 00:14:01,110
(Curtain rod, curtain, and vacuum cleaner)

405
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,210
One of the objects on their list must be ordinary.

406
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:04,915
It could be the teddy bear.

407
00:14:05,014 --> 00:14:06,780
Teddy bear? You want to put it on the list, right?

408
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:09,080
- Yes, I do. - It's on your mind, right?

409
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:11,450
I don't think they will steal the teddy bear.

410
00:14:11,454 --> 00:14:13,995
I want to put it on the list because it's cute.

411
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,195
You have a kind heart.

412
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:17,565
That's right, Haha.

413
00:14:18,928 --> 00:14:20,835
The teddy bear is on my mind.

414
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:23,065
- That's because you are innocent. - Shall we choose the teddy bear?

415
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:24,400
Give me a break.

416
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,730
(Give me a break.)

417
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:30,600
- Why are you feigning innocence? - The teddy bear is on my mind.

418
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,200
I want to choose the teddy bear.

419
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,070
I want to put the teddy bear on the list.

420
00:14:34,076 --> 00:14:36,770
The teddy bear must be lonely outside.

421
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,185
It's scary to see Haha act that way in that outfit.

422
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:43,755
(A spirit in black that chases after teddy bears)

423
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:46,680
- He looks like a spirit. - Teddy bear! Teddy bear!

424
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,425
Someone should restrain his arms.

425
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,190
(Thank you for bringing my teddy bear.)

426
00:14:51,193 --> 00:14:52,495
So Min, you brought the teddy bear!

427
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:54,765
For goodness' sake.

428
00:14:54,864 --> 00:14:56,460
Will you lay it down?

429
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:57,975
(Do you want to lie down?)

430
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,330
So Min, the teddy bear is cold.

431
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:04,005
- I will bring a blanket. - Bring a pillow, too.

432
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,600
Give me a break.

433
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:09,470
(Give me a break!)

434
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,280
Don't kick the teddy bear.

435
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,610
We don't have time for this.

436
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:14,085
Are we really putting it on the list?

437
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:17,180
- What's the purpose of this? - It's cute.

438
00:15:17,186 --> 00:15:18,380
- What? - It became cute.

439
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:19,850
It will confuse the other team.

440
00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:22,220
They will think about what this means.

441
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,065
Do this, and put the teddy bear on the list.

442
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:27,320
- Okay. - They will think it's a trap.

443
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:29,265
- We will use that. - Will it be the teddy bear...

444
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:31,900
Shall we do this and put a blanket on the list?

445
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,160
Let's put something on its paw.

446
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,305
I vote for the teddy bear.

447
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:36,775
Why are you suddenly voting for the teddy bear?

448
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:40,000
- You were against it. - What made you change your mind?

449
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,385
It's really cute.

450
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,015
What's wrong with you?

451
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,980
(Forget your innocence.)

452
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,085
What's wrong with you?

453
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,825
Have you gone crazy?

454
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,510
What's wrong with you?

455
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,755
She hates you.

456
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:53,825
(From this moment on, we are bear hunters.)

457
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:58,235
(Which objects are on House B's Shuddering List?)

458
00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:01,365
Each team chose three objects...

459
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:03,565
and turned in the list.

460
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,500
It's obvious what they chose.

461
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:06,960
They probably chose whatever objects they saw first.

462
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:08,875
- A refrigerator. - That's right.

463
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,170
- We... - Tell us.

464
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:11,575
(Suddenly)

465
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:14,175
I can estimate the size.

466
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:15,570
No way.

467
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,580
- Is it about this big? - Can we carry it like this?

468
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,910
It's about this big.

469
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,280
It's something that you can show.

470
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:21,850
Here's a hint.

471
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,585
Basically,

472
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,280
- if you were to carry it... - You won't give us a hint.

473
00:16:26,288 --> 00:16:28,620
(He doesn't believe Kwang Soo.)

474
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:29,950
That's nonsense.

475
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:31,935
- You wouldn't give any. - It was funny.

476
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,890
I have to say something.

477
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:37,105
You should go home while you still can.

478
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:39,630
You're not in good shape.

479
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,430
- Listen to Jae Seok. - Goodness.

480
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,930
It's because he's on Jong Kook's team.

481
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,615
I have nothing to fear here.

482
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:47,340
- Hey. - You punks.

483
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:48,410
Calm down.

484
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,585
- He suddenly seems strong. - Seriously.

485
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:53,340
- Even his legs look big. - He seems strong.

486
00:16:53,349 --> 00:16:55,080
- Let me borrow your shoulder. - Hey.

487
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:56,210
- We're the boss. - Let me borrow your shoulder.

488
00:16:56,218 --> 00:16:57,855
- You'd better watch out. - Watch out.

489
00:16:57,987 --> 00:16:59,620
- How dare you? - Be careful of your glasses.

490
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:01,990
- Watch out. - Say what's wrong.

491
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:03,650
- What about our glasses? - Be careful.

492
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,060
His kick looks higher.

493
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,595
He looks more flexible today.

494
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,790
- By the way, So Min. - Yes?

495
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:11,800
- You have eye booger. - Where?

496
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,875
(Jae Seok acts friendly.)

497
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:15,770
(She isn't embarrassed after 2 years of being on Running Man.)

498
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:17,330
It's off now.

499
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,015
It was booger from her nose.

500
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:20,715
It was eye booger.

501
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:22,010
So Min has...

502
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:24,340
dead skin on her feet. She has boogers in her eyes.

503
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:26,310
- She also farts. - Did she fart?

504
00:17:26,315 --> 00:17:28,385
- No, I didn't. - We were talking...

505
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,910
with So Min while sitting on a blanket in the waiting room.

506
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,580
Suddenly, she made a noise.

507
00:17:32,588 --> 00:17:34,565
(There's a sound from So Min.)

508
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,195
- Really? - She let it go easily.

509
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,295
I pretended not to hear it.

510
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,560
That sound is from this song.

511
00:17:42,564 --> 00:17:45,930
(Singing)

512
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,805
Fatsia shoots are seasonal in the spring.

513
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:51,075
The sound was very cute.

514
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:53,415
- It was cute. - Goodness.

515
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:56,545
Here's the first mission.

516
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:59,040
It's called Tactless Quiz.

517
00:17:59,048 --> 00:18:00,715
(Tactless Quiz)

518
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,510
Three members from each team will participate.

519
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:06,055
One team answers while the other team distracts.

520
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:08,325
Then the roles switch.

521
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:12,690
The teams listen to the question. Make a guess out of five choices.

522
00:18:12,695 --> 00:18:14,605
You stand up when a sound is given.

523
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,130
If the number of standing members equals to the answer,

524
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:18,635
the team that answers earns a point.

525
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:22,105
If they don't equal, the distracting team earns a point.

526
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,100
However, if no one stands up...

527
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,410
or everyone stands up,

528
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:32,410
the answering team gets a chance to answer the question.

529
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:33,940
The team with more points...

530
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,350
wins a Luxury Sticker and a chance to steal at the opponent's house.

531
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:39,120
The losing team gets a Shuddering Sticker.

532
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:41,295
(The losing team gets a Shuddering Sticker.)

533
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,120
We must win.

534
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:44,695
- Seriously. - Let's do it.

535
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,960
You seriously won't.

536
00:18:46,962 --> 00:18:48,630
We have an advantage.

537
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,665
We have many smart members, don't we?

538
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:52,760
- Smart? - We have many smart members.

539
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,575
- Who's smart? - There's Han Na.

540
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:57,600
Compared to the other team, we're definitely smarter.

541
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:58,770
Definitely.

542
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,040
Has anyone led the class?

543
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,810
- I have. - I was also the school president.

544
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,440
- I was the school president. - I was too.

545
00:19:03,445 --> 00:19:04,840
- I was the school president. - I was physical education leader.

546
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,440
- I was the class president once. - I did accounting.

547
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:07,680
- Accounting? - Accounting?

548
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,525
(She brings up accounting.)

549
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:12,120
- Accounting sounds good. - That's right.

550
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,650
- You lead. - Okay.

551
00:19:13,655 --> 00:19:14,690
- Listen. - I approve of accounting.

552
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,850
- Was anyone a class president? - I was physical education leader.

553
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:17,590
- Was anyone a class president? - You sit down.

554
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:19,660
- You sit down. - Class president, sit here.

555
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:20,660
- Basically, - It was in elementary school.

556
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:23,160
that team is too ambitious.

557
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:24,630
- Them? - They're full of ambitions.

558
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:26,360
It isn't such a big deal.

559
00:19:26,368 --> 00:19:28,105
No one is doing it for the team.

560
00:19:28,637 --> 00:19:30,945
- We only want attention. - Goodness.

561
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
We have to win the first game no matter what.

562
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,370
- We have to play until the end. - It's easy to win.

563
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,340
- Get ready. Here we go. - It could be difficult.

564
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:38,655
(Team Pink wins a point if they answer correctly.)

565
00:19:39,748 --> 00:19:42,485
It's a mountain famous for 12,000 peaks.

566
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,750
Its name differs...

567
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:46,555
based on four seasons.

568
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:50,350
Which is not a name of this mountain?

569
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,990
- This is so easy. - I like this.

570
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:53,020
- Okay. - It's so easy.

571
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,890
Number one, Kumkang Mountain.

572
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:55,930
That's right.

573
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,430
Number two, Bongrae Mountain.

574
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:58,430
- Okay. - Right.

575
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:00,130
Number three, Kooknae Mountain.

576
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:02,870
(What's Kooknae Mountain?)

577
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,405
Number four, Pungak Mountain.

578
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:06,615
Number five, Gaegol Mountain.

579
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:08,840
Gosh.

580
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,640
I learned this a long time ago.

581
00:20:10,646 --> 00:20:12,685
It was a long time ago, but I remember all.

582
00:20:13,816 --> 00:20:15,580
- I don't know. - The one that isn't...

583
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:16,810
- or is? - They don't know the answer.

584
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,720
(They're shocked.)

585
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,820
- What? - Which is it?

586
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:21,080
- The correct name? - No.

587
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,120
The one that isn't?

588
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,020
Excuse me. I have a question.

589
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:26,660
How do you spell Gaegol Mountain?

590
00:20:26,662 --> 00:20:28,735
(She's serious about her question.)

591
00:20:29,565 --> 00:20:31,230
- Just imagine the spelling. - It's Gaegol.

592
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:32,835
(Why is that important?)

593
00:20:33,335 --> 00:20:34,870
- It's G-A-E-G-O-L. - I see.

594
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,145
Gaegol Mountain is wrong.

595
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:37,845
Which number was it?

596
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,500
It's number five. Gaegol Mountain doesn't exist.

597
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,015
- What was the spelling? - Isn't it number three?

598
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:44,910
- Isn't it Kooknae Mountain? - No.

599
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,610
- When they say Foreign Mountain... - In the past,

600
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,750
they asked what was something that always spun.

601
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,610
The answer was a bear, which is nonsense.

602
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,620
Kooknae Mountain sounds suspicious, but that may be wrong.

603
00:20:53,622 --> 00:20:55,320
That's why Gaegol Mountain is the answer.

604
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:57,465
(Is that so?)

605
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,920
- I don't think they know. - No.

606
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,120
- I don't think they know. - I don't think so.

607
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,630
What should we do?

608
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,205
- I think this is it. - Right.

609
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,575
Let's do this.

610
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:07,735
- You and me. - Okay.

611
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:10,530
We need to distract them,

612
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:12,415
but no one knows the answer.

613
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,710
(What's Team Green's answer?)

614
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,440
- Okay. - Stand in the count of three.

615
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:18,815
- Okay. - I'm not sure if it's right.

616
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,855
1, 2.

617
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:24,480
(If it's not 3, Team Green earns a point.)

618
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:26,495
(What's the result?)

619
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:28,165
Three.

620
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,035
(Team Pink fails to answer.)

621
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:35,090
I knew it.

622
00:21:35,097 --> 00:21:36,960
(Team Pink's answer is Bongrae Mountain.)

623
00:21:36,965 --> 00:21:39,235
Number two, Bongrae Mountain.

624
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,675
It's incorrect. What's the correct answer?

625
00:21:41,703 --> 00:21:43,200
Number five, Gaegol Mountain.

626
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,775
(She's sure of herself.)

627
00:21:45,674 --> 00:21:47,615
The answer is Kooknae Mountain.

628
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,910
(The answer is number 3.)

629
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,780
- I told you. - You were wrong.

630
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,210
It was Kooknae Mountain.

631
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:55,210
- I knew it. - What did you listen to Da Hee?

632
00:21:55,217 --> 00:21:56,580
Come on.

633
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:59,350
How could you? You deserve respect.

634
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:00,380
What have you done, So Min?

635
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,250
- Only I told the truth. - Han Na.

636
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:03,920
I thought it was strange.

637
00:22:03,926 --> 00:22:05,520
I didn't expect much from the other two.

638
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:06,860
How can you say that?

639
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:08,690
- They thought it existed. - I know that much.

640
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,560
- Me too. - That was cheeky.

641
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,760
No one said anything about the answer except Da Hee.

642
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:14,260
- We said something. - No way.

643
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,330
Didn't you know?

644
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:16,900
Da Hee.

645
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:18,845
- We had to answer simultaneously. - What?

646
00:22:18,907 --> 00:22:21,015
- No. - They didn't know the answer.

647
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:22,140
Right.

648
00:22:22,144 --> 00:22:24,580
They thought that number five was the answer.

649
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,380
That's frustrating.

650
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,855
Let's play again. The roles switch.

651
00:22:28,917 --> 00:22:30,425
Shall we change? Have a seat.

652
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,155
- Jin Young and Ji Hyo. - Shall we?

653
00:22:32,354 --> 00:22:34,555
Has anyone gotten all As?

654
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:37,050
- I haven't gotten all As. - Not all A's.

655
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:38,635
I'm sure someone scored 2 in math.

656
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,790
- What? Who? - Two points in math.

657
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:40,865
Did anyone score two points in math?

658
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:42,635
- I scored 4. - 4?

659
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

660
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,730
- My score was 7. - Stop it.

661
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:48,630
- Are you looking down on us? - Why did you bring that up?

662
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,045
I shouldn't have said it.

663
00:22:50,138 --> 00:22:51,970
I cried after scoring four points during the college entrance exam.

664
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:54,045
(Did Jae Seok score low too?)

665
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:56,470
You can score higher than four even if you guess.

666
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,210
I cried after scoring four points.

667
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:00,085
I went to the movies after scoring four points.

668
00:23:00,582 --> 00:23:02,480
Your grades aren't everything.

669
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,650
- Right. - I'm serious.

670
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:04,980
Despite that, he became a great man.

671
00:23:04,987 --> 00:23:06,920
Studying isn't for everyone.

672
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:08,120
- Right. - That's right.

673
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:10,090
- Studying is an inborn talent. - Of course.

674
00:23:10,092 --> 00:23:11,790
- One is born with such a talent. - Right.

675
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:13,865
- Here's the next question. - Let's go.

676
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:17,260
It's a question for fourth graders.

677
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,100
- It'll be so easy. - Okay.

678
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:20,660
I was smart until then.

679
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:23,475
Among numbers that round up to 70,

680
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,175
what's the largest natural number?

681
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:32,415
Number 1, 72. Number 2, 73. Number 3, 74. Number 4, 75. Number 5, 76.

682
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:34,410
Is it for fourth graders?

683
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,650
- Natural number? - Yes.

684
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:36,750
What's this?

685
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:38,725
- How can a number round up to 70? - Isn't it too hard?

686
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:40,880
- Isn't it too harsh? - Wait.

687
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,350
- It has to be from 75. - I know.

688
00:23:42,357 --> 00:23:45,095
When rounded up, it becomes 80.

689
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:47,495
- A natural number? - It's 74.

690
00:23:47,863 --> 00:23:49,205
It's 74.

691
00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:50,635
- Is that right? - Yes.

692
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,835
- Isn't it 74? - Is that the largest?

693
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,545
- It's 74 because... - It has to round up to 74.

694
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:58,400
- What's a natural number? - It's 74.

695
00:23:58,407 --> 00:24:00,345
Let me ask the other team.

696
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:03,685
Do you know what a natural number is?

697
00:24:04,146 --> 00:24:06,055
(Who do you think we are?)

698
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,650
- Are you doing that on purpose? - Tell us.

699
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,925
What's a natural number?

700
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,980
Naturally...

701
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:14,555
(Naturally, it is...)

702
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,195
"Naturally"?

703
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,195
- "Naturally". - Look at them.

704
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,035
Da Hee said...

705
00:24:21,063 --> 00:24:22,590
Don't say it.

706
00:24:22,597 --> 00:24:24,130
- I won't say it. - What did she say?

707
00:24:24,132 --> 00:24:25,975
I asked her what a natural number was.

708
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:27,475
"There's such a thing?"

709
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:28,875
Da Hee.

710
00:24:28,904 --> 00:24:31,445
- No, stop it. - Okay.

711
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:34,475
It's because she started working when she was young.

712
00:24:35,544 --> 00:24:36,570
- It's possible not to know. - What did you say?

713
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:38,280
While others were studying...

714
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,215
- Haha. - What are you talking about?

715
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:42,480
- Da Hee is crying. - I'm sorry.

716
00:24:42,484 --> 00:24:44,155
She's a good person.

717
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,620
She really is.

718
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,850
- She's good at... - Right.

719
00:24:46,855 --> 00:24:47,920
long jumps.

720
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:48,990
She's good at jumping.

721
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,690
It's okay as long as I'm kind.

722
00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:52,795
It's nothing embarrassing.

723
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,060
- Are you ready? - A number that's...

724
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,330
Shouldn't we answer this correctly?

725
00:24:57,332 --> 00:24:58,900
- What's a natural number? - I thought about it too.

726
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,460
- This is the most convincing. - A natural number is...

727
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:03,130
(It's the team that distracts.)

728
00:25:03,138 --> 00:25:05,700
- They think we know the answer. - Right.

729
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:07,015
(At least, one person will stand.)

730
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,115
Listen. I'll talk in numbers.

731
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,710
- Do this... - Right.

732
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,040
- or this. - Okay.

733
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:16,480
- No, I pick this. - I pick the first.

734
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:18,225
- Me too. - Really? Okay.

735
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,055
- Okay. - Okay?

736
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:21,995
- Are you ready? - Yes.

737
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:23,850
- I'm certain. - Let's go.

738
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,760
- Stand up in three. - Okay.

739
00:25:25,761 --> 00:25:26,895
Let's go!

740
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,130
1, 2, 3.

741
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:32,335
(Team Pink, who must distract, may fail.)

742
00:25:32,434 --> 00:25:33,805
Okay.

743
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,870
- All right. - They stood up.

744
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,105
(What really happened?)

745
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:41,445
(Standing up)

746
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:44,710
(Da Hee suddenly stands up.)

747
00:25:44,713 --> 00:25:45,910
Why did you stand up?

748
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,240
- Did she stand up later? - What?

749
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,510
- No. - What's wrong?

750
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:49,580
Why did you do it?

751
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:51,595
- You said you'd sit. - Isn't it over?

752
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,955
- Is it 75? - No.

753
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,350
No.

754
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:57,795
- No, the answer is number 3, 74. - Okay.

755
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,590
We almost lost it.

756
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,460
Did you think that number four was the answer?

757
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:02,690
Wait, Da Hee.

758
00:26:02,697 --> 00:26:03,930
- We didn't check. - Wait.

759
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:04,960
That's not it.

760
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:06,475
She didn't stand up, right?

761
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,400
(He interrupts.)

762
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:10,500
She didn't stand up.

763
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:11,670
- She didn't stand up. - She did.

764
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:12,770
She got up.

765
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,300
- She got up. - What's with you?

766
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,840
She got up? I just wanted to double-check.

767
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,110
- She got up. - Stay out of it.

768
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,210
She got up.

769
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,340
- She didn't get up. - You didn't get up, did you?

770
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:21,040
- She didn't. - Why did you get up?

771
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:23,150
- Aren't we supposed to answer? - Go see the sea.

772
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:25,980
- He's acting strange. - Go dig some cockles.

773
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:27,480
- Stay there for a while. - What's with him?

774
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,790
Stay there.

775
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,150
- Calm down. - Collect yourself.

776
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:32,690
Good.

777
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:34,860
We knew Da Hee would get up.

778
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:36,830
- I... - Well...

779
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:38,760
- I just don't understand. - We kept saying...

780
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,230
it was either 0 or 3.

781
00:26:41,236 --> 00:26:43,300
- The thing is... - We knew the answer.

782
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:44,500
We agreed on zero.

783
00:26:44,506 --> 00:26:45,770
The only explanation is that she's a spy.

784
00:26:45,774 --> 00:26:47,340
I'm really sorry,

785
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:49,240
but I thought the other team was going to answer.

786
00:26:49,244 --> 00:26:51,240
- So I was watching... - It's like the Zero Game.

787
00:26:51,246 --> 00:26:52,340
- She got confused. - We agreed on not getting up.

788
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:53,840
Anyway, thank you, Da Hee.

789
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,050
- Did you drink last night? - No, I don't drink.

790
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:57,350
- Seriously... - Da Hee.

791
00:26:57,352 --> 00:26:58,950
- Do you want to attract attention? - No.

792
00:26:58,954 --> 00:27:00,350
- I don't want to. - Be honest.

793
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,750
- I really don't. - Tell us the truth.

794
00:27:01,756 --> 00:27:04,090
- It doesn't make sense. - I'll just stay quiet.

795
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,320
- I can't do this. - Can you get down on the ground?

796
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,035
- Can you get down on the ground? - Okay.

797
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm sorry. I mean it.

798
00:27:10,565 --> 00:27:11,600
(What did I do?)

799
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,300
Get down on the ground for a moment.

800
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:15,375
Can we arrest a spy now if there even is one?

801
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,875
I mean it.

802
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:19,700
I understand it now. I'll stay quiet.

803
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,670
- We could have a spy today too. - I'm not a spy.

804
00:27:22,677 --> 00:27:25,440
Da Hee's cap has the same color as our uniform.

805
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,710
(Da Hee is wearing a pink cap.)

806
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:28,825
No.

807
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,680
No.

808
00:27:30,685 --> 00:27:32,825
(She throws her cap on the ground.)

809
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:36,425
(Da Hee explodes for the 3rd week in a row.)

810
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:39,220
Please trust me this once.

811
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:40,560
I can do better.

812
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:43,205
She's been acting suspiciously since last week.

813
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:44,530
If we say something, she cries.

814
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:47,230
No, I won't cry. I'll work hard.

815
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,005
You better not cry right now.

816
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:52,175
Haha's cap is impossible to read.

817
00:27:52,507 --> 00:27:53,500
(Which team am I on?)

818
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:56,140
- That's right. - He can be on either team.

819
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:57,710
- All right. - I'm so sorry.

820
00:27:57,712 --> 00:28:00,210
- I'm sorry. - She's crying.

821
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:01,985
- No, I'm not. - This time,

822
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,610
Se Chan and Seok Jin will play.

823
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:04,755
Okay.

824
00:28:05,153 --> 00:28:07,095
Let's just leave it to luck.

825
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:08,720
- Should guys try? - Only guys.

826
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,720
- Only guys. - Okay.

827
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:13,320
This question can be a bit tricky.

828
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,795
- It'll be tricky. - Okay.

829
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,930
Which of the following terms is not related to beverages?

830
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:20,275
- Beverages? - Beverages?

831
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:22,770
Number one, brewmaster.

832
00:28:22,771 --> 00:28:24,630
Number two, barista.

833
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,645
Number three, digerati.

834
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,515
Number four, negociant.

835
00:28:28,677 --> 00:28:30,045
Number five, sommelier.

836
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:33,310
A digerati must be someone who makes desserts.

837
00:28:33,315 --> 00:28:34,610
It seems so.

838
00:28:34,616 --> 00:28:35,725
Negociant?

839
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:39,495
It must have something to do with "Hometown Report".

840
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:41,750
That's right.

841
00:28:41,756 --> 00:28:43,825
Or "this is my place."

842
00:28:43,992 --> 00:28:45,995
- I love that. - "Hometown Report".

843
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:50,665
- That's what it means. - "Digerati" means "drop dead".

844
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:52,330
(What?)

845
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:53,405
No.

846
00:28:53,868 --> 00:28:55,905
- What did you say? - Nothing.

847
00:28:56,538 --> 00:28:57,945
What are you doing?

848
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,240
I thought she swore.

849
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,940
- I thought she swore. - I thought she swore.

850
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:03,415
- Did you mean "digerati"? - It's number three.

851
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,040
I just read number three.

852
00:29:05,046 --> 00:29:06,210
I was so surprised.

853
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:08,385
- Digerati. - Gosh.

854
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:11,125
- I think this is the answer. - Yes.

855
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:13,420
(Number 3, digerati)

856
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:14,580
- Okay. - I think so too.

857
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,450
Then...

858
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,890
We should all get up.

859
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,190
Yes.

860
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,335
Excuse me.

861
00:29:20,762 --> 00:29:21,930
Why are you three sitting?

862
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:24,235
Only one person is answering.

863
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:25,930
(It's not like that.)

864
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:27,300
- Are you robots? - No.

865
00:29:27,302 --> 00:29:29,230
- Are you robots? - It's not like that.

866
00:29:29,237 --> 00:29:31,230
Are you avatars?

867
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,500
Avatars?

868
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:33,840
- What are you saying? - Are you just...

869
00:29:33,842 --> 00:29:35,740
- his flags? - Avatars?

870
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,340
Gosh. Avatars?

871
00:29:37,345 --> 00:29:39,940
Don't be absurd. What are you talking about?

872
00:29:39,948 --> 00:29:41,480
We're not listening to him.

873
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:43,710
Do as Seok Jin said.

874
00:29:43,718 --> 00:29:45,050
We should, right? Okay.

875
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,350
- Look at him. - He's happy.

876
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:49,065
- He can do what he wants. - "I was right."

877
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,495
Without realizing...

878
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:53,220
If they don't know, they'll go for this.

879
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:55,535
- They'll go for this. - Yes.

880
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:57,290
Let's go for that.

881
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:00,575
What about this?

882
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:02,905
Okay. Let's do that.

883
00:30:03,938 --> 00:30:05,470
- Team Green, are you ready? - You...

884
00:30:05,473 --> 00:30:07,445
You get up. Yes.

885
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:09,745
Here we go. One...

886
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:12,385
1, 2, 3.

887
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:16,955
(If they answer correctly, Team Pink will earn 1 point.)

888
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,555
(What's the result?)

889
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:22,420
(5 people stand up.)

890
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:23,995
- Okay. - Okay.

891
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,360
(Number 5, sommelier is obviously wrong.)

892
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,635
- Good job. - Well done.

893
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,130
- Why did you get up? - Why did you get up?

894
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,860
- You said we'd leave it to luck. - Why did you get up?

895
00:30:30,865 --> 00:30:33,500
- You said we'd take a chance. - Why didn't you get up?

896
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:34,830
- Why didn't you get up? - We should have all gotten up.

897
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:36,830
- Exactly. - Why didn't you get up?

898
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:38,740
Number five, sommelier, is wrong.

899
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,245
The correct answer is number three, digerati.

900
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,240
- Is it someone who makes desserts? - That was right.

901
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,855
It must be related to desserts.

902
00:30:46,147 --> 00:30:49,110
The word, derived from "digital" and "literati",

903
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:50,310
- means the elite of digitalization. - No cakes?

904
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:51,450
- No cakes? - No desserts?

905
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:52,880
- No desserts. - No cakes.

906
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,295
(Team Green gets ahead by luck.)

907
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,725
1, 2, 3.

908
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:58,760
- Okay. - Okay.

909
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,660
(But Jong Kook's robots catch up and win.)

910
00:31:00,662 --> 00:31:02,290
- We win! - See?

911
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:03,290
I was right!

912
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:05,400
Team Pink wins a Luxury Sticker.

913
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,775
(1 Luxury Sticker goes to Team Pink.)

914
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:10,830
A Shuddering Sticker for you.

915
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,700
Well done.

916
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:14,575
(The winning team has another benefit.)

917
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:17,385
As I informed you earlier,

918
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,540
Team Pink can play Get Out! Time to Steal.

919
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:20,840
(They can win another Luxury Sticker.)

920
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:24,050
Steal and move one item from Team Green's house...

921
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:27,250
to your house within five minutes for another Luxury Sticker.

922
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,425
Okay.

923
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,060
If you fail to steal something or the stolen item is on the list,

924
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,465
you'll get a Shuddering Sticker.

925
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,430
- You'll get a Shuddering Sticker. - Okay.

926
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,030
- Let's go! - Let's go!

927
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,335
I'm so sorry.

928
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,230
It's okay. Forget about it.

929
00:31:40,235 --> 00:31:42,230
When the whistle is blown,

930
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:43,975
- your five minutes starts. - Okay.

931
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:45,075
Ready.

932
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:49,110
Let's go!

933
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,315
- We don't have much time. - Let's get it!

934
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:52,585
Let's get it!

935
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,915
(They enter Team Green's house.)

936
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,185
Guys.

937
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:01,580
(What is this?)

938
00:32:01,589 --> 00:32:03,450
They put some things together here.

939
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,620
Well...

940
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:07,365
(The teddy bear definitely looks suspicious.)

941
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:11,565
(It's almost asking to be stolen.)

942
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,330
They're in the house now.

943
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:15,700
They're inside.

944
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:18,505
They might pick up information from our conversation.

945
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:20,545
Not this.

946
00:32:21,976 --> 00:32:23,085
Guys.

947
00:32:23,344 --> 00:32:25,340
The window.

948
00:32:25,346 --> 00:32:27,515
Let's take it.

949
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,710
I think it'll be safe.

950
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:30,625
(The window?)

951
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:32,250
Let's go.

952
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:33,520
- That one? - Let's go.

953
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,265
- What's that? - What's that?

954
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:36,750
- It's the window. - It's the window.

955
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,920
Look at their faces. They don't look happy.

956
00:32:38,927 --> 00:32:40,820
(There's a story behind the window.)

957
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:43,830
(2 hours ago, they were writing the list.)

958
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,100
(The window was included at first,)

959
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,405
(but it was taken away at the last minute.)

960
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:51,375
It's probably not on the list.

961
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,870
We have some time left. Let's see.

962
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:55,585
- Let's go. - Have you decided?

963
00:32:56,044 --> 00:32:57,915
- Yes. - Gosh.

964
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:01,785
(Disappointed)

965
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,050
Come here!

966
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:06,250
- Okay. - At the last minute...

967
00:33:06,254 --> 00:33:07,450
You changed it?

968
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:08,450
(They've stolen a window.)

969
00:33:08,456 --> 00:33:09,520
Here we go.

970
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:10,625
(It's been 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

971
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:11,965
Okay.

972
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,190
(Screaming)

973
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:17,930
We should all just die.

974
00:33:17,932 --> 00:33:19,075
I'm so angry.

975
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:21,860
They seemed surprised.

976
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,630
It was probably on their minds.

977
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,440
They seemed very frustrated.

978
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,015
They probably included it in the list...

979
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:29,510
- and then took it away. - At the last minute.

980
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,870
- Yes. - They changed their minds.

981
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,655
Are they done?

982
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:34,510
- Not yet. - No?

983
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,480
They're watching us.

984
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:37,850
We should act.

985
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:39,950
Keep smiling.

986
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:41,150
Some of us should smile.

987
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,790
- They're acting. - No.

988
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,150
- They are. - They are.

989
00:33:44,158 --> 00:33:45,695
They're acting.

990
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:47,290
Stay still.

991
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,390
(They try to look suspicious.)

992
00:33:48,396 --> 00:33:50,335
- It's a mind game. - Should we change?

993
00:33:50,431 --> 00:33:51,805
No.

994
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,805
- Is it done? - Is time up?

995
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,045
(Cheering)

996
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:59,940
- Wait. - I think they mean it.

997
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:02,740
- He's acting. - We're acting.

998
00:34:02,744 --> 00:34:04,970
- Exactly. - We're acting.

999
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,710
- Keep acting. - Gosh.

1000
00:34:06,714 --> 00:34:08,140
That was too obvious.

1001
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,110
Time is not up yet.

1002
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:12,250
Let's get something else. They mean it.

1003
00:34:12,253 --> 00:34:14,650
- They do? - I'm sure.

1004
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,520
- It's on the list. - Should we get something else?

1005
00:34:16,524 --> 00:34:17,950
- They mean it. - Should we change our minds?

1006
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,190
- I'm sure. - Get something else.

1007
00:34:19,193 --> 00:34:20,960
- Get something else! - Hurry up!

1008
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,665
- Don't put on your shoes! - Hurry!

1009
00:34:24,098 --> 00:34:26,130
- They bought it. - We tricked them.

1010
00:34:26,134 --> 00:34:27,730
Gosh!

1011
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:31,205
- What are you doing? - Time is up!

1012
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:33,315
- What are you doing? - Time's up!

1013
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:37,570
Teddy bear.

1014
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:38,610
Let's take the teddy bear.

1015
00:34:38,613 --> 00:34:41,315
(Team Pink takes the teddy bear instead.)

1016
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,950
Time is up!

1017
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,250
Time is up, Ji Hyo!

1018
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:48,355
No. We have 30 seconds left.

1019
00:34:49,457 --> 00:34:50,450
(It's stolen.)

1020
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:53,595
Good job. We have three seconds left.

1021
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:55,630
My teddy bear!

1022
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,760
Gosh.

1023
00:34:56,764 --> 00:35:00,605
(Is the teddy bear on the list?)

1024
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:05,200
Team Pink stole the teddy bear...

1025
00:35:05,206 --> 00:35:07,075
within five minutes.

1026
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:10,840
The teddy bear...

1027
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:13,410
(Is it on the list?)

1028
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:14,410
Is...

1029
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:19,050
(Is it on the list?)

1030
00:35:19,053 --> 00:35:20,420
Not on the list.

1031
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:24,325
(They succeed.)

1032
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:27,095
You get another Luxury Sticker.

1033
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:30,660
(Team Pink stole the teddy bear.)

1034
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,105
Will they steal the teddy bear?

1035
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,705
I don't think they'll touch it.

1036
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:36,705
(They removed the teddy bear from the list.)

1037
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,640
(That was close.)

1038
00:35:40,641 --> 00:35:42,240
We did it.

1039
00:35:42,243 --> 00:35:43,610
You should take something ordinary.

1040
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,640
Something ordinary.

1041
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:47,040
(Team Pink wins another Luxury Sticker.)

1042
00:35:47,048 --> 00:35:49,850
Let's move to another place for the next mission.

1043
00:35:49,851 --> 00:35:51,655
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1044
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:53,120
I have a good feeling.

1045
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:55,425
We have 2 Luxury Stickers, and they have 1 Shuddering Sticker.

1046
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,520
One member from each team...

1047
00:35:58,526 --> 00:36:00,220
will move together.

1048
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:02,020
Please decide the order now.

1049
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:05,190
- Okay. - Will there be a vote?

1050
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,830
- What vote? - To find a spy?

1051
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:10,300
We have two stickers right now.

1052
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:11,445
We could vote who should get the stickers.

1053
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:13,500
They have two Luxury Stickers.

1054
00:36:13,508 --> 00:36:14,815
We have one Shuddering Sticker.

1055
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,240
- Then why don't we... - Should we just go in order?

1056
00:36:17,245 --> 00:36:18,670
- Go in order. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. - Okay.

1057
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:20,110
- Should we do that? Sure. - Let's do that.

1058
00:36:20,114 --> 00:36:21,755
(It only takes them 10 seconds to decide.)

1059
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,625
Which members will go first?

1060
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:26,820
- I'll be first from Team Pink. - Okay.

1061
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,225
- Make it interesting. - Then I'll go first.

1062
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:32,260
(Wait, Han Na will join me?)

1063
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:36,230
(Does this mean...)

1064
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,790
- Let's go. - Okay.

1065
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,175
- Let's go. - "Let's go."

1066
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:42,600
- She sounded too business-like. - I know.

1067
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,830
- Han Na is strong, - Yes?

1068
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:45,230
and you're weak.

1069
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,915
(We hope it works out with her.)

1070
00:36:48,976 --> 00:36:50,415
- "You're weak." - What do you think it is?

1071
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:54,280
- Our team thought it'd be a vote. - A vote?

1072
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:55,750
Which two members will take the Luxury Stickers?

1073
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,280
- Se Chan. - What's that?

1074
00:36:57,285 --> 00:36:58,650
- I see a roulette. - Seriously?

1075
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,595
(She exercises her reasoning skill.)

1076
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,350
(Han Na turns into a detective after spotting a mysterious roulette.)

1077
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:04,865
- I see a roulette. - Seriously?

1078
00:37:05,593 --> 00:37:07,320
- No, we need to go up. - I see.

1079
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:09,690
- My gosh. That looked like it. - You're a terrible detective.

1080
00:37:09,697 --> 00:37:11,630
We have to take the stairs.

1081
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:13,575
- Come on, Han Na. - Be careful.

1082
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:15,375
- What's that? - What's this?

1083
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,630
- Yes! - It's time for our lunch.

1084
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:19,545
(It's time for our lunch.)

1085
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:22,140
(Today's lunch is rice,)

1086
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,210
(stir-fried sausages and vegetables, steamed eggs,)

1087
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,140
(stir-fried spicy pork,)

1088
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:28,380
(dried laver, kimchi,)

1089
00:37:28,382 --> 00:37:30,550
(lettuce,)

1090
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,595
(and seaweed soup.)

1091
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:35,195
- Can we eat? - Can we eat now?

1092
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:37,190
Aren't you hungry?

1093
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:38,590
- Yes. I'm starving. - Yes.

1094
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:41,390
Now, you'll do a mission, and your lunch is at stake.

1095
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:44,065
I will tell you the rules of Get the Dish! Time to Steal.

1096
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:49,675
Each member will choose a dish that they want in order.

1097
00:37:49,704 --> 00:37:53,675
Overlapped dishes will be taken out after everyone has picked a dish.

1098
00:37:53,808 --> 00:37:56,185
A point will be accumulated per remaining dish.

1099
00:37:56,344 --> 00:37:59,955
You can have your lunch with only the remaining dishes.

1100
00:38:00,214 --> 00:38:02,925
The team with higher points will receive a Luxury Sticker...

1101
00:38:02,984 --> 00:38:04,280
and time to steal.

1102
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,580
The losing team will receive a Shuddering Sticker.

1103
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,050
(The losing team will receive a Shuddering Sticker.)

1104
00:38:08,055 --> 00:38:09,050
This is crazy.

1105
00:38:09,056 --> 00:38:11,665
Everyone will choose the stir-fried spicy pork and sausages.

1106
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:14,835
My hunger is clouding my judgement even more.

1107
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,335
I knew it. You wouldn't let us eat in peace.

1108
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,160
I want to eat everything. What should I do?

1109
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,235
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1110
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:24,305
But Jong Kook won't like any of these dishes.

1111
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:26,070
I'll be quick...

1112
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,870
(Meanwhile, Han Na from Team Green...)

1113
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:31,445
- I'll choose stir-fried spicy pork. - Stir-fried spicy pork?

1114
00:38:32,013 --> 00:38:33,315
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1115
00:38:33,381 --> 00:38:35,040
I think a lot of people will choose that dish.

1116
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:37,310
I think that's why people won't choose that dish.

1117
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:38,585
I did some detective work.

1118
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,725
Here she goes again. She's bad at that.

1119
00:38:41,856 --> 00:38:43,825
If I were to speculate,

1120
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:46,720
I will take a big portion of the stir-fried spicy pork...

1121
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:49,905
so that everyone can enjoy this. I'll take a lot.

1122
00:38:50,865 --> 00:38:52,475
My gosh, I'm so torn.

1123
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:56,545
- They will try to guess your dish. - Right.

1124
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:59,245
- Right. I'm weak. - They will do that.

1125
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,740
- You're not weak. - When they think of me,

1126
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,015
my image is closer to lettuce.

1127
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:04,845
- Is that so? - We can't choose the same dish.

1128
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,915
I will take lettuce.

1129
00:39:07,448 --> 00:39:08,855
- You chose your dishes, right? - Yes.

1130
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,855
- You can go to your tables. - Okay.

1131
00:39:11,252 --> 00:39:14,195
- This is driving me crazy. - I don't know about this.

1132
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,865
I wonder which dish Han Na took.

1133
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:19,935
My gosh, your team will have a hard time guessing.

1134
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:21,690
I'm in trouble. I shouldn't have come second.

1135
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:23,805
(Team Green is swarming with members who are prone to betray.)

1136
00:39:23,864 --> 00:39:26,005
I get the feeling Kwang Soo will choose spicy pork.

1137
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,335
Haha and Sang Yeob will choose the same dish.

1138
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:29,530
- Right. - So Min will choose that too.

1139
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:31,705
Everyone who's ambitious will choose stir-fried spicy pork.

1140
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,140
I am worried about my team.

1141
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,385
To be honest, we didn't see eye to eye earlier.

1142
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,210
I can't trust my team.

1143
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,840
Seriously, So Min. Your team can be a handful.

1144
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,115
- Yes! - Okay.

1145
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,950
Ji Hyo, I knew you'd pick that.

1146
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:45,550
- He really did. - Did you know I'd get dried laver?

1147
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:46,620
- Of course, I did. - It's true.

1148
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:48,695
- I knew you'd choose that. - Han Na.

1149
00:39:49,357 --> 00:39:51,220
- You got the pork? - We didn't get the same one.

1150
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,390
But Kwang Soo will definitely pick that one.

1151
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:57,190
But he might not choose this because everyone expects that.

1152
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:59,030
No, he doesn't think like that.

1153
00:39:59,033 --> 00:40:00,130
- He just takes what he wants. - Really?

1154
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:01,800
- He doesn't think? - No, he doesn't.

1155
00:40:01,802 --> 00:40:03,545
(He never thinks about that.)

1156
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:05,430
He doesn't do that?

1157
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:08,815
I hope Kwang Soo can be smart and bring rice.

1158
00:40:09,677 --> 00:40:11,740
I think Jong Kook will bring...

1159
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:13,340
- The eggs. A healthy dish. - Right.

1160
00:40:13,347 --> 00:40:15,340
- Will he bring lettuce? - No, no.

1161
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,080
I think he will probably pick steamed eggs...

1162
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:18,485
(I don't think so.)

1163
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:21,220
- Our dishes can't overlap. - If they do, we'll take them out.

1164
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:23,065
- Is rice part of this too? - Yes, it is.

1165
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:25,690
People might not choose steamed eggs because...

1166
00:40:25,693 --> 00:40:26,990
- they might think I will. - That makes sense.

1167
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,520
I'll choose steamed eggs!

1168
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,305
(This is Jong Kook's reasoning.)

1169
00:40:30,798 --> 00:40:33,700
(Just like Ji Hyo predicted, Jong Kook chooses steamed eggs.)

1170
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,005
I can just eat this.

1171
00:40:37,204 --> 00:40:39,770
(The plates fly away with the wind.)

1172
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:40,900
Hey, you fool!

1173
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:42,845
If you took one, you should've placed the stone on top.

1174
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,180
Why are you so selfish?

1175
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:49,010
(Jong Kook scolds Kwang Soo.)

1176
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:52,155
You only play a considerate cop which I don't know how it happened.

1177
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:56,590
(It's his first time being scolded for playing a nice cop.)

1178
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,165
But you only think about yourself.

1179
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,195
I wasn't going to come third.

1180
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,390
What are you talking about?

1181
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,465
Get your food. Take a lot of food.

1182
00:41:05,933 --> 00:41:07,860
If the dishes don't overlap, everyone will get their own dish.

1183
00:41:07,868 --> 00:41:09,275
(You don't need to take a lot.)

1184
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:11,300
That's why I took a lot.

1185
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,570
(You should've told me that earlier.)

1186
00:41:12,573 --> 00:41:14,340
- I thought they were bricks. - If the dishes don't overlap,

1187
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,970
- we'll give you more. - No wonder.

1188
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:17,840
If he eats that much, he will lay eggs.

1189
00:41:17,845 --> 00:41:18,940
(What if he lays eggs?)

1190
00:41:18,946 --> 00:41:21,055
(I didn't know.)

1191
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,950
(What did Kwang Soo, who doesn't use his reasoning skills, choose?)

1192
00:41:24,952 --> 00:41:26,350
The main dishes are the spicy pork and sausages.

1193
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,525
That's so disappointing. I really want to eat the sausages.

1194
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:30,795
I'm sure Kwang Soo will bring us sausages.

1195
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:32,860
In my opinion, Kwang Soo and Sang Yeob...

1196
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,995
will bring the sausages and spicy pork.

1197
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,430
- They're coming. - They're coming.

1198
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,660
(Jong Kook is here.)

1199
00:41:37,665 --> 00:41:40,200
- Did you bring rice? What is it? - My gosh, Se Chan.

1200
00:41:40,201 --> 00:41:41,560
(3 of Team Pink's dishes don't overlap.)

1201
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:42,900
- I didn't think you'd get that. - Is that rice?

1202
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,205
You got steamed eggs, right?

1203
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:48,240
(Team Green's dishes won't overlap if it's not spicy pork or lettuce.)

1204
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:49,340
Please.

1205
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:51,310
(Team Green's dishes won't overlap if it's not spicy pork or lettuce.)

1206
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:52,440
Kwang Soo!

1207
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:57,450
(Which dish did Kwang Soo choose?)

1208
00:41:57,451 --> 00:41:59,120
- Is that spicy pork? - I told you.

1209
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,220
(No way that's spicy pork.)

1210
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:02,725
(Yes, it's the stir-fried spicy pork again.)

1211
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,625
I told you. You lost the stir-fried spicy pork.

1212
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,435
- Okay! - I told you he'd bring that.

1213
00:42:07,895 --> 00:42:09,565
I told you so.

1214
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:11,905
We can't eat the pork now.

1215
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:13,930
See? I told you.

1216
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,930
I knew that he'd bring the dish he wants to eat.

1217
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:17,200
- You wanted to eat that, right? - All right.

1218
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,430
- Take out the spicy pork. - I really like meat.

1219
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,900
- He even brought a big portion. - I thought about it and took this.

1220
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,985
(Poor you. We secured all three dishes.)

1221
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:25,545
- I should've brought dried laver. - So Min should have...

1222
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,740
- If we're going to lose this... - So Min, you can't eat now.

1223
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:30,385
Hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing?

1224
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:32,050
(Licking)

1225
00:42:32,052 --> 00:42:33,595
You tasted the sauce. Lucky you.

1226
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:37,550
(Let me smell it at least.)

1227
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,765
Kwang Soo, you can't do that.

1228
00:42:39,894 --> 00:42:42,035
(My gosh, my spicy pork.)

1229
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:45,060
- Seok Jin has to bring rice. - If you think about it,

1230
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:48,560
the oldest must bring us rice. He's providing us the staple.

1231
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,430
Here's what I think. The rest of our teammates will bring...

1232
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,840
spicy pork, spicy pork, spicy pork, and sausages.

1233
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,645
Right? Da Hee seems like...

1234
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:57,115
the very competitive type. She wants to win.

1235
00:42:57,178 --> 00:42:59,440
- She needs to be in the spotlight. - She must be in the spotlight.

1236
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:02,280
To be in the spotlight, she has to bring the spicy pork.

1237
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:03,350
It's time for the spicy pork.

1238
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,680
I bet...

1239
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:05,680
(Da Hee hovers around the spicy pork.)

1240
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:06,920
I bet people before you took it.

1241
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,995
But that might be why people might not have taken this dish.

1242
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:12,125
Spicy pork. You're craving spicy pork, right?

1243
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:13,395
I really want to eat it.

1244
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:16,030
Today...

1245
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,260
No, I shouldn't follow my instincts today.

1246
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,905
(I really want the spicy pork, but I mustn't follow my instincts.)

1247
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:24,245
Here they come.

1248
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:26,100
- Da Hee, what did you bring? - Which dish is it?

1249
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,270
(Da Hee chose another dish.)

1250
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,340
- Please. - What about you, Seok Jin?

1251
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:29,340
(They still have a shot.)

1252
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:30,470
What did you bring, Da Hee?

1253
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:32,585
(They still have a shot to catch up as long as it's not lettuce.)

1254
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,925
(What? What is that?)

1255
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:37,225
Please.

1256
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:39,250
What did you bring, Da Hee?

1257
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:42,080
(What was that face just now?)

1258
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,090
So Min, I don't think you and I can get along.

1259
00:43:44,091 --> 00:43:45,865
- Lettuce? - It must be the lettuce.

1260
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:49,905
(Out of all the dishes, she had to choose the lettuce.)

1261
00:43:50,531 --> 00:43:51,890
(Team Green has 0 dish now.)

1262
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:53,260
- We don't have to eat lettuce. - Yes, it's out.

1263
00:43:53,267 --> 00:43:54,560
- That's all right. - We won't just eat this.

1264
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:55,830
- We still have two more shots. - But we will get the sticker.

1265
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:57,400
We still have two more members. It's all right.

1266
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:59,145
- Their dishes will overlap too. - You didn't bring two, right?

1267
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:02,300
- What did you bring, Seok Jin? Why? - We still have two more members.

1268
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:03,745
- My goodness. - Why?

1269
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:07,015
What did you bring, Seok Jin? His plate must be light.

1270
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,210
(Team Pink wanted rice. Which dish did Seok Jin bring?)

1271
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,310
Tell us.

1272
00:44:10,317 --> 00:44:11,810
(Team Pink wanted rice. Which dish did Seok Jin bring?)

1273
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,020
Hey, we're awesome.

1274
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,295
(They succeed 4 times in a row. It's rice!)

1275
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,350
(They don't overlap miraculously 4 times in a row.)

1276
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,420
Look. Didn't I tell you?

1277
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,690
- I said the oldest will bring rice. - It's because...

1278
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:23,490
- we need to have rice. - I told you so.

1279
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:24,805
This is awesome.

1280
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:27,600
- It's over. - I got goosebumps when I saw this.

1281
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:29,375
- We lost, right? - No, no.

1282
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,445
It's tied if ours don't overlap and theirs overlap.

1283
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:33,100
It's not over yet.

1284
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:34,100
(Where did we go wrong?)

1285
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:36,045
- I mean... - If Haha brings that, he's a hero.

1286
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,485
- My gosh, this is crazy. - Someone probably took the pork.

1287
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:42,985
- Who's left in your team? - It's Sang Yeob.

1288
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:45,655
- I see. He's unpredictable. - Right.

1289
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:47,595
He might bring the spicy pork.

1290
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:49,490
- I should've brought the sausages. - Just bring sausages.

1291
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:51,320
- I really wanted to eat sausages. - Please bring sausages.

1292
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:52,565
(It'd be nice if he picks sausages.)

1293
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,820
- I'll take this. - Me too.

1294
00:44:54,828 --> 00:44:56,165
- You won't regret it, right? - No.

1295
00:44:56,297 --> 00:44:58,265
I wanted to take the other dish.

1296
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,575
Someone probably already took it.

1297
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,300
- It could be tied. - It might be sausages or rice.

1298
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:04,930
(Depending on their dishes, the game could be tied.)

1299
00:45:04,939 --> 00:45:07,340
Please. We don't need lettuce.

1300
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:08,515
Please, Jae Seok.

1301
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:10,470
- What is it? - What did you bring?

1302
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:12,110
It seems light. It's not spicy pork.

1303
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:14,285
Why? Why? Did a lot of you choose spicy pork?

1304
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:18,585
- What did you bring? - Is it pork? It's red!

1305
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,180
- It's lettuce. - What is it?

1306
00:45:21,188 --> 00:45:25,020
(He brought something red. Did he bring spicy pork?)

1307
00:45:25,025 --> 00:45:27,335
- What is it? - It's red!

1308
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:28,590
Kimchi.

1309
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:32,065
(I got you, didn't I? It's kimchi, not the stir-fried spicy pork.)

1310
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,630
(We didn't overlap this time again!)

1311
00:45:34,635 --> 00:45:36,130
- Good job. - Sang Yeob.

1312
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:37,475
- Great job. - Okay.

1313
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:38,970
- Their dishes must overlap now. - I thought...

1314
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,175
- Their dishes must overlap now. - It's Jae Seok.

1315
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,745
- It has to. - It must be sausages or spicy pork.

1316
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:45,185
- Please. - Kimchi will be good too.

1317
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:46,640
Or the seaweed soup.

1318
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:48,780
- Overlap 1 more dish. - Jae Seok, 1 more dish.

1319
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,985
- Please. - You brought what you like, right?

1320
00:45:51,185 --> 00:45:53,080
My gosh, the rice...

1321
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:56,295
(What does this mean?)

1322
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:57,595
- He's a moth too. - Hey, Grasshopper.

1323
00:45:57,691 --> 00:45:58,750
What is it, Jae Seok?

1324
00:45:58,759 --> 00:45:59,960
(If it overlaps, it will be 2 to 2 and tied.)

1325
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,160
- He must've brought rice. - Is it rice?

1326
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:03,060
(If it overlaps, it will be 2 to 2 and tied.)

1327
00:46:03,063 --> 00:46:04,965
- My gosh, the rice... - He must've brought rice.

1328
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,330
- Is it rice? - No, he brought a delicious dish.

1329
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,530
I should've gotten the spicy pork.

1330
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:08,560
(Feeling disappointed)

1331
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,330
(He chose seaweed soup which doesn't overlap.)

1332
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:11,370
What is it?

1333
00:46:11,372 --> 00:46:12,570
- It's soup. - What?

1334
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:15,040
(The soup doesn't overlap.)

1335
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,110
Spicy pork.

1336
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,510
- What is it? - Bring it.

1337
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:19,755
You should've brought spicy pork.

1338
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,755
(They're disappointed.)

1339
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,010
Why did we bring so much?

1340
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,580
(Feeling hopeless)

1341
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:28,720
Why did our dishes overlap so much?

1342
00:46:28,722 --> 00:46:30,220
I should've brought spicy pork.

1343
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:32,320
- I thought someone took some. - I know.

1344
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:33,495
Everyone thought so.

1345
00:46:34,094 --> 00:46:36,190
The dishes don't overlap.

1346
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:37,905
- I know. - I'm so happy.

1347
00:46:38,198 --> 00:46:40,300
- We still won. - We definitely won.

1348
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,800
We did. I knew it.

1349
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:42,800
(We knew it.)

1350
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:45,845
It's about teamwork.

1351
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:48,800
- We can't do it. - Teams without teamwork can't.

1352
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:50,185
(They give up.)

1353
00:46:50,944 --> 00:46:52,670
Remove the dishes that overlap.

1354
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:54,010
Remove two rice.

1355
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,255
(Team Pink earns one Luxury Sticker.)

1356
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,150
That's for that team.

1357
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:58,310
(Steamed eggs and kimchi come.)

1358
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,120
This is unbelievable.

1359
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,965
We aren't learning about history. What's this?

1360
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:07,165
- Can you give us more steamed eggs? - They aren't enough.

1361
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:11,005
- Goodness. - Lunch is served

1362
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:13,730
Lunch is served to you

1363
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:16,245
- Start playing the music - Goodness.

1364
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,330
Play music

1365
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:19,475
(What did you say?)

1366
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,945
Play music for us while we eat delicious food

1367
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:26,815
- Play music - Play music

1368
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:29,310
- Let's eat quietly. - Okay.

1369
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:31,185
Why is the rice so sweet?

1370
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:34,850
- It's sweet, it's so sweet - It's sweet, it's so sweet

1371
00:47:34,855 --> 00:47:38,365
- Rice is so sweet - It's so sweet

1372
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:41,465
(I can't take it anymore.)

1373
00:47:41,762 --> 00:47:43,565
There's a dish for each person.

1374
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,890
Hey, Han Na.

1375
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:48,200
(She steals some sausages to take revenge.)

1376
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,705
What are you doing?

1377
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,270
What's wrong with you?

1378
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:52,300
(I'm sorry. I won't steal it.)

1379
00:47:52,306 --> 00:47:53,815
Goodness, Jae Seok.

1380
00:47:54,007 --> 00:47:56,585
- That's nice of you. - Hey.

1381
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,985
What is it?

1382
00:47:58,479 --> 00:47:59,840
(He gives some to So Min.)

1383
00:47:59,847 --> 00:48:01,240
Wait a minute.

1384
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:02,455
(She takes a bite.)

1385
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,010
(What's wrong?)

1386
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:06,325
Come on. Hey, hey.

1387
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,320
Look at her. Hey.

1388
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:10,195
(Kwang Soo eats this time.)

1389
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:12,890
(Give me back my sausage.)

1390
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:15,190
Stop it, Kwang Soo.

1391
00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:18,090
(She eats it herself.)

1392
00:48:18,098 --> 00:48:20,400
- Han Na is weird. - You'll be scolded.

1393
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,430
(You like to steal and eat.)

1394
00:48:21,435 --> 00:48:22,705
What's wrong with her?

1395
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:24,470
- How is it... - It's so delicious.

1396
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:26,005
How is it so delicious?

1397
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:28,175
- Seriously. - I'm not kidding.

1398
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:30,140
How could it...

1399
00:48:30,144 --> 00:48:32,545
Can you give us a wrap?

1400
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:34,855
- Yes. - What do we have to do?

1401
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:38,280
Those who can sing may sing.

1402
00:48:38,285 --> 00:48:40,380
(We're willing to listen.)

1403
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:43,150
(Goodbye)

1404
00:48:43,157 --> 00:48:44,150
What did you say?

1405
00:48:44,158 --> 00:48:45,150
(Forget everything)

1406
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,895
- The lyrics are wrong. - You should sing.

1407
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:49,660
Be serious about singing.

1408
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,865
If you sing seriously...

1409
00:48:52,733 --> 00:48:55,675
(Kwang Soo sings seriously.)

1410
00:48:56,003 --> 00:48:59,845
(I was taken somewhere, and when I opened my eyes)

1411
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,470
(He's quite serious.)

1412
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:04,985
- He sings well. - Stand up and sing.

1413
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,380
(He suddenly stands up.)

1414
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:08,955
(Everyone joins.)

1415
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:13,720
(To get at least a grain of rice...)

1416
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,950
Everyone is singing.

1417
00:49:14,955 --> 00:49:20,660
(The whole team stands up because they're hungry.)

1418
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:22,190
You're not in harmony.

1419
00:49:22,196 --> 00:49:23,730
Are they singing the same song?

1420
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,005
You should sing in sync.

1421
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,500
(With the current)

1422
00:49:31,505 --> 00:49:34,715
(Let the harmony flow)

1423
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:39,855
(Forget harmonizing)

1424
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:42,455
(From the start)

1425
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,885
(They sing in chorus.)

1426
00:49:45,118 --> 00:49:48,525
(Spicy pork, your existence)

1427
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,765
(Sausages, you didn't exist)

1428
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:56,535
(Rice, as I wasn't in your life)

1429
00:49:56,897 --> 00:49:59,830
I'll give this to someone who sings with desperation.

1430
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:01,075
(Sing with desperation.)

1431
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:02,200
With desperation.

1432
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:04,175
(They're all desperate.)

1433
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:05,600
(As hungry as I was)

1434
00:50:05,606 --> 00:50:06,800
Seriously.

1435
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:09,245
(Someday)

1436
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,255
(I'm more desperate.)

1437
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:14,740
Keep singing.

1438
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:16,750
(I must eat the wrap)

1439
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,910
(For myself who must eat the wrap)

1440
00:50:18,919 --> 00:50:20,750
- How about dance music? - Dance music is the best.

1441
00:50:20,754 --> 00:50:22,555
(Sing a dance music.)

1442
00:50:22,756 --> 00:50:25,050
- Dance. - Dance music is fun.

1443
00:50:25,058 --> 00:50:26,090
If not, I'll eat it.

1444
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:29,805
5, 4, 3.

1445
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:33,730
(Here comes a dance song.)

1446
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,130
(Barefooted youth)

1447
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,905
(Chanting)

1448
00:50:37,938 --> 00:50:40,475
(However, I won't stop here)

1449
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:46,610
(Here we go, give us a wrap.)

1450
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:48,985
- That was great. - Sang Yeob did the best.

1451
00:50:49,316 --> 00:50:50,525
All right.

1452
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:52,680
- Sang Yeob. - This one was good.

1453
00:50:52,686 --> 00:50:54,550
I sang an entire song.

1454
00:50:54,554 --> 00:50:56,950
Sang Yeob did it better than you.

1455
00:50:56,957 --> 00:50:58,665
- What? - He did better.

1456
00:50:58,792 --> 00:51:00,790
(The wrap is delicious.)

1457
00:51:00,794 --> 00:51:03,105
I wrapped sausage and spicy pork.

1458
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:05,135
I washed my hands beforehand.

1459
00:51:05,832 --> 00:51:07,130
So Min.

1460
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:09,635
(She dances without music.)

1461
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:11,805
That's not dance music.

1462
00:51:12,306 --> 00:51:14,570
That's not dance music.

1463
00:51:14,574 --> 00:51:17,815
(I'll help you out, So Min.)

1464
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:21,385
(He sings for So Min.)

1465
00:51:22,482 --> 00:51:24,955
- Keep dancing. - Come here.

1466
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:28,595
(There's no wrap with discount in this world.)

1467
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:34,490
(Goodness, Jae Seok.)

1468
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:37,605
(Give me the wrap.)

1469
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:41,435
(Laughing)

1470
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:42,900
You have to earn it.

1471
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:45,475
(Try eating this wrap.)

1472
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:47,640
(While he gives the wrap,)

1473
00:51:47,641 --> 00:51:50,470
(the sausage drops.)

1474
00:51:50,477 --> 00:51:51,885
- It fell out. - The sausage...

1475
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,410
(Did you drop the sausage?)

1476
00:51:53,413 --> 00:51:55,315
(I'll eat it for you.)

1477
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:57,050
Hey.

1478
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,580
(They fight for the sausage.)

1479
00:51:58,585 --> 00:51:59,995
It's mine!

1480
00:52:03,957 --> 00:52:05,290
(I grabbed it first.)

1481
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,835
Goodness.

1482
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:09,735
He ate it.

1483
00:52:09,796 --> 00:52:10,965
Isn't it delicious?

1484
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:12,560
That was hilarious.

1485
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:13,805
(Did that sausage mean that much?)

1486
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:15,830
Do something like singing.

1487
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:17,470
Otherwise, you'll starve.

1488
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:20,040
(The others should do something.)

1489
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,215
(I shouldn't starve.)

1490
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,440
(What?)

1491
00:52:24,444 --> 00:52:26,010
- What's going on? - Is she drunk?

1492
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:27,810
(She overworks her throat.)

1493
00:52:27,814 --> 00:52:29,015
Is she drunk?

1494
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:31,925
(Please stop, Da Hee.)

1495
00:52:32,686 --> 00:52:36,390
(She sings diligently.)

1496
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,590
(She cries without finishing.)

1497
00:52:39,593 --> 00:52:41,020
If you turn back time...

1498
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:42,890
(I'll pretend that I didn't see it.)

1499
00:52:42,896 --> 00:52:44,265
Think about it again.

1500
00:52:44,931 --> 00:52:46,635
This isn't right, Da Hee.

1501
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,930
Go back.

1502
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:49,160
This is wrong, Da Hee.

1503
00:52:49,169 --> 00:52:50,700
It's so embarrassing.

1504
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:53,575
I feel more embarrassed for her.

1505
00:52:53,807 --> 00:52:54,875
Wait.

1506
00:52:55,575 --> 00:52:57,640
This isn't a musical.

1507
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:59,010
(What Da Hee did was wrong.)

1508
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:02,015
Did anyone order lettuce wrap?

1509
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:05,210
- Did anyone order spicy pork? - Bring it here

1510
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:06,250
- Excuse me - Give me lettuce

1511
00:53:06,253 --> 00:53:09,650
- Here's your lettuce and spicy pork - Give it to me

1512
00:53:09,656 --> 00:53:11,495
Who wants to eat it?

1513
00:53:11,992 --> 00:53:14,260
I want to eat it

1514
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,405
(She gets back to the musical mode.)

1515
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,360
Do you want some, Da Hee?

1516
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,060
I do

1517
00:53:21,067 --> 00:53:22,960
Give me one bite

1518
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:26,575
Show us your talent as much as you want to eat

1519
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,575
(Singing in a high tone)

1520
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:31,745
(Jo Su Mi appears.)

1521
00:53:32,078 --> 00:53:34,240
(Only a wrap will end it.)

1522
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:37,180
(It's a frightening version of "Queen of the Night".)

1523
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:39,755
All right, I'll give it to you. Open your mouth.

1524
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:41,680
Isn't it delicious?

1525
00:53:41,688 --> 00:53:44,250
(A sausage falls out.)

1526
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:49,395
(Another fight for the sausage breaks out.)

1527
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,735
- My goodness. - It's unbelievable.

1528
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:54,360
- How did he find it? - He's a hyena.

1529
00:53:54,367 --> 00:53:55,900
(I worked hard to earn it.)

1530
00:53:55,902 --> 00:53:57,670
- Han Na. - You get it if you dance ballet.

1531
00:53:57,671 --> 00:53:58,900
I'll do it.

1532
00:53:58,905 --> 00:54:00,170
Just show us your pose.

1533
00:54:00,173 --> 00:54:02,370
- Should I turn? - Music should be...

1534
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,710
(She's convinced.)

1535
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,510
Sang Yeob, can you play some music?

1536
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:06,940
- Could you? - Yes.

1537
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:09,010
She needs music to dance.

1538
00:54:09,015 --> 00:54:10,150
Make it look graceful.

1539
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:11,710
1, 2, 3, 4.

1540
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:14,795
(She turns like a ballerina.)

1541
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:18,690
(The background music doesn't stop her.)

1542
00:54:18,692 --> 00:54:21,395
(Han Na turns gracefully.)

1543
00:54:22,195 --> 00:54:25,560
(Take this wrap immediately.)

1544
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:28,335
Do it one more time, Han Na.

1545
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:29,600
Do it from here.

1546
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,975
Can you give me half since I sang?

1547
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:33,415
(Laughing)

1548
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,770
(She turns very well.)

1549
00:54:36,776 --> 00:54:42,315
(The background music makes it look like a circus trick.)

1550
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:47,080
(Her circus show is over.)

1551
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:48,195
Han Na.

1552
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:51,490
- She dances well. - She does.

1553
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:52,920
I shouldn't have sung.

1554
00:54:52,926 --> 00:54:54,320
I got hungrier.

1555
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:56,965
- I got hungrier after eating. - I could turn well as I'm hungry.

1556
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:01,100
- Try some spicy pork. - Today's spicy pork is excellent.

1557
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:03,600
Spicy pork is really delicious.

1558
00:55:03,603 --> 00:55:04,675
(Will Team Green have enough time to steal?)

1559
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:07,040
Get Out! Time to Steal will start.

1560
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,670
You may start from here.

1561
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:11,340
If Team Pink succeeds, you may earn a Luxury Sticker.

1562
00:55:11,344 --> 00:55:14,240
- I forgot about that. - Oh, no.

1563
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,280
(They win a Luxury sticker if they succeed again.)

1564
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:17,380
You get another one.

1565
00:55:17,384 --> 00:55:19,085
- If we succeed? - Okay.

1566
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,450
Did you give up?

1567
00:55:20,453 --> 00:55:22,720
- No, of course not. - We can do it. Let's try it.

1568
00:55:22,722 --> 00:55:23,990
Do you have a screwdriver?

1569
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:25,020
Really?

1570
00:55:25,025 --> 00:55:26,390
You have to find it.

1571
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:27,795
- Really? - Really?

1572
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:30,160
- Shall I try to find it? - Are you ready?

1573
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:31,835
Get ready.

1574
00:55:32,532 --> 00:55:33,600
Start.

1575
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,830
(The time limit is 5 minutes.)

1576
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:35,960
(Get Out! Time to Steal starts.)

1577
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:37,200
Start.

1578
00:55:37,203 --> 00:55:38,870
- Is ours House B? - Where is it?

1579
00:55:38,872 --> 00:55:40,470
- House B. - It's right here.

1580
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,470
It's here.

1581
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:42,745
(They must steal something bigger than a teddy bear.)

1582
00:55:45,111 --> 00:55:47,585
Let's see. We have time.

1583
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:49,255
Shall we take this?

1584
00:55:49,716 --> 00:55:51,125
Isn't it too heavy?

1585
00:55:52,819 --> 00:55:55,195
- How about the mattress? - The mattress.

1586
00:55:55,422 --> 00:55:56,765
- The mattress. - Shall we take it?

1587
00:55:57,857 --> 00:55:58,965
Let's go and see.

1588
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:01,120
What should we do?

1589
00:56:01,127 --> 00:56:03,405
- We made the wrong decision. - We haven't won once.

1590
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,860
- It's driving me crazy. - I gave the benefit of a doubt.

1591
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:06,930
It's not happening.

1592
00:56:06,933 --> 00:56:08,000
(They lose the game and get stolen.)

1593
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:09,805
It's quite serious today.

1594
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,000
Guys.

1595
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:17,370
- What? - The red cabinet.

1596
00:56:17,377 --> 00:56:19,045
- Where is it? - It's in there.

1597
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:20,110
What?

1598
00:56:20,113 --> 00:56:21,380
It might be too obvious.

1599
00:56:21,381 --> 00:56:24,125
Exactly. That's why we should take it.

1600
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:26,550
- I found it! - What?

1601
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:27,580
You found it.

1602
00:56:27,587 --> 00:56:29,020
(Screwdriver)

1603
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:31,090
- We found the screwdriver. - Hurry!

1604
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:32,195
(They've been looking for it.)

1605
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:34,365
Where did you find it?

1606
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:38,490
(If we can find a screwdriver,)

1607
00:56:38,498 --> 00:56:41,605
(we can take the door off.)

1608
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:43,100
- We can do it. - We could do that.

1609
00:56:43,103 --> 00:56:46,775
- They probably didn't think of it. - Right.

1610
00:56:47,607 --> 00:56:50,885
(Team Pink has been planning to steal a door.)

1611
00:56:51,144 --> 00:56:53,070
- We don't have much time. - Hold the door.

1612
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:54,885
- It's working. - Hold the door.

1613
00:56:55,715 --> 00:56:58,110
- Are we stealing a door? - We're stealing a door.

1614
00:56:58,118 --> 00:56:59,710
It's working.

1615
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:01,020
It's just like I expected.

1616
00:57:01,021 --> 00:57:03,020
They're taking the door off.

1617
00:57:03,023 --> 00:57:04,995
I knew it.

1618
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:06,690
- Keep going! - Not yet.

1619
00:57:06,693 --> 00:57:07,920
Hurry.

1620
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:08,920
Be careful.

1621
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:11,260
- 40 seconds left. - Hey.

1622
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:12,690
Move!

1623
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:13,700
Let's go!

1624
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,805
- They took it off! - Hurry!

1625
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,170
- You took it off? - They can't take it out.

1626
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:19,675
(They really took the door off.)

1627
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,640
- Let's go! - Hurry!

1628
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,200
- Come! - Hurry!

1629
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,910
Run!

1630
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:27,010
- Go barefoot! - Come out!

1631
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:28,640
- Run! - Move!

1632
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:30,080
- Get out of the way! - Run!

1633
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:32,085
- Hurry! - Run!

1634
00:57:32,218 --> 00:57:33,285
Let's go.

1635
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:35,755
- Hurry! - Hurry!

1636
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:37,950
Run! Hurry!

1637
00:57:37,957 --> 00:57:39,065
Okay!

1638
00:57:39,092 --> 00:57:41,190
Put it down.

1639
00:57:41,194 --> 00:57:42,695
(Time is up.)

1640
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:45,430
(Did Team Pink succeed?)

1641
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,705
We took the door off.

1642
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:50,275
We didn't expect you to find a screwdriver.

1643
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:52,430
- Our teamwork is amazing. - Totally.

1644
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:55,145
Has their teamwork always been that good?

1645
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:58,315
Since when was it so good?

1646
00:57:58,378 --> 00:58:00,210
When Jong Kook is on the other team, I fight with him.

1647
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:02,380
- Yes. When we're on the same team, - But when we're on the same team...

1648
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:04,285
- we couldn't get along any better. - Exactly.

1649
00:58:05,018 --> 00:58:06,225
Gosh, that's so annoying.

1650
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,295
Anyway, you finished within five minutes.

1651
00:58:09,823 --> 00:58:11,695
- Please. - This item is...

1652
00:58:12,225 --> 00:58:15,395
There's no way they thought of the door.

1653
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,190
This item is...

1654
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:23,336
(The door is...)

1655
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:25,705
This item is...

1656
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:31,978
(The door is...)

1657
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:33,613
On the list. You failed.

1658
00:58:33,613 --> 00:58:36,616
(You failed the mission.)

1659
00:58:36,983 --> 00:58:38,051
Seriously?

1660
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:39,786
The door is on the list?

1661
00:58:40,153 --> 00:58:44,190
(They expected us to steal the door?)

1662
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:47,794
(They were discussing.)

1663
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,230
They must want to surprise us.

1664
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:54,600
- They might take this door off. - I thought so too.

1665
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:59,305
(We know how the other guys think.)

1666
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:00,907
(Shuddering List)

1667
00:59:00,907 --> 00:59:01,908
(Door)

1668
00:59:01,908 --> 00:59:05,645
(Like Haha suggested, they included the door in the list.)

1669
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,649
- We did it! - We did it!

1670
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:12,585
(Haha's clever idea turns the situation around.)

1671
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,088
How did you think of the door?

1672
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:20,026
Haha is so...

1673
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,796
Aren't you happy too?

1674
00:59:24,063 --> 00:59:28,067
(1 Shuddering Sticker goes to Team Pink. What will happen now?)

1675
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:31,838
This is the third round...

1676
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:34,073
and your last chance to win a Luxury Sticker.

1677
00:59:34,073 --> 00:59:36,743
You're Out! Kick the Can.

1678
00:59:36,743 --> 00:59:39,279
The two teams will take turns and attack.

1679
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:42,949
The offense team has to either kick the can...

1680
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:46,019
or try to save as many members as possible within five minutes.

1681
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:47,520
Is it a physical game?

1682
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,655
It's over.

1683
00:59:48,721 --> 00:59:50,824
- Jong Kook is smiling. - Jong Kook.

1684
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:53,993
- He's smiling. He knows he'll win. - Do something!

1685
00:59:53,993 --> 00:59:56,429
You guys are so weak.

1686
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:59,899
But you still have a chance. Four on the defense team will...

1687
00:59:59,899 --> 01:00:03,336
try to protect the can, and two will chase the offense team.

1688
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,538
The defending members can remove an attacker's name tag...

1689
01:00:05,538 --> 01:00:07,740
and eliminate them.

1690
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:10,310
The chasing members on the defense team can move freely.

1691
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,878
They can eliminate their opponents...

1692
01:00:11,878 --> 01:00:13,746
by touching them.

1693
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:16,149
The can has to go out of the lines.

1694
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:18,818
1 can will earn you 3 points, and 2 cans will earn you 10.

1695
01:00:18,818 --> 01:00:20,820
Each surviving member will earn the team one point.

1696
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,889
If everyone survives, the team earns 10 points.

1697
01:00:22,922 --> 01:00:23,990
10 points?

1698
01:00:24,357 --> 01:00:26,826
Are you allowed to fart when you're defending?

1699
01:00:27,694 --> 01:00:29,562
Please allow that. We have no choice.

1700
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:31,331
A short one is okay, right?

1701
01:00:31,531 --> 01:00:33,800
Please give us one point if we fart.

1702
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:35,468
For example...

1703
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:36,669
(Is this okay?)

1704
01:00:36,669 --> 01:00:38,638
- Would this be okay? - That deserves 10 points.

1705
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,307
(Are they really my teammates?)

1706
01:00:41,808 --> 01:00:44,844
If you pull that off, you win.

1707
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:46,913
If you pull off that melody, you'll win 10 points.

1708
01:00:46,913 --> 01:00:49,415
- That's great. You can do it. - Can you do it?

1709
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:51,417
Can you do it?

1710
01:00:51,417 --> 01:00:54,187
(How can I possibly do that?)

1711
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:57,757
Please decide which team will attack first.

1712
01:00:57,991 --> 01:01:00,059
- We should defend first. - Let's figure it out.

1713
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:01,628
Who wants to protect the can?

1714
01:01:01,728 --> 01:01:04,230
1 can earns you 3 points, and 2 cans earn you 10 points.

1715
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:06,900
Why don't we focus on just one can?

1716
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,302
- So that they can't kick both cans. - Should we?

1717
01:01:09,302 --> 01:01:11,037
I think someone strong should protect it.

1718
01:01:11,037 --> 01:01:12,238
Jong Kook should be the guard.

1719
01:01:12,238 --> 01:01:13,940
- You should. - And...

1720
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,575
Let's come up with strategies.

1721
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,510
We can't.

1722
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,279
We need to know where Jong Kook will be.

1723
01:01:19,279 --> 01:01:22,048
Jae Seok is strong too. So is Se Chan.

1724
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:23,883
Ji Hyo will be outside.

1725
01:01:23,883 --> 01:01:26,319
Jin Young and Jong Kook will team up.

1726
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,288
Me and Jong Kook will be the guards.

1727
01:01:28,288 --> 01:01:30,790
- Jong Kook, I have a question. - The girls will...

1728
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,625
(I have a question.)

1729
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:37,730
Will you be guarding the cans, or will you be moving?

1730
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:41,067
(Tell me your position.)

1731
01:01:41,067 --> 01:01:42,268
We can't tell you.

1732
01:01:42,268 --> 01:01:44,270
- Randomly? - I'm being polite.

1733
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:45,638
Please tell me.

1734
01:01:45,638 --> 01:01:46,739
Are you...

1735
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:49,108
I'm sorry, but we're not that close.

1736
01:01:49,108 --> 01:01:51,878
We're being polite.

1737
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:54,013
Kwang Soo, you should have come.

1738
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:56,349
- We're not that close. - You should have asked him.

1739
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,784
What should we do?

1740
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:00,386
Go away. I'll talk to him.

1741
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:01,854
Can you do it?

1742
01:02:01,888 --> 01:02:03,823
Jong Kook, please stay in the lines.

1743
01:02:03,823 --> 01:02:04,924
- What? - Stay in the lines.

1744
01:02:04,924 --> 01:02:06,960
Stay in the lines? All right. You can go.

1745
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,361
- Go. - Okay.

1746
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:09,429
We can't tell you.

1747
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,864
I think he'll keep his promise.

1748
01:02:12,098 --> 01:02:15,068
They want you to be in the lines. You shouldn't.

1749
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:16,636
They might be playing with us.

1750
01:02:16,803 --> 01:02:18,538
Right.

1751
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:20,540
We'll invite you to our farting show.

1752
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:23,710
- Can you really do that? - I can't!

1753
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:25,478
- Practice! - How could I do that?

1754
01:02:25,478 --> 01:02:28,348
Just give it a try. You almost succeeded.

1755
01:02:28,648 --> 01:02:30,049
Just add some melody.

1756
01:02:30,049 --> 01:02:32,418
(Melody)

1757
01:02:33,419 --> 01:02:36,189
Gosh! This is so annoying!

1758
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:37,590
Jump. Go down.

1759
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,725
I heard it.

1760
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,827
(Farting)

1761
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:44,130
- Is it your superpower? - It was too obvious.

1762
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:46,466
It showed.

1763
01:02:47,333 --> 01:02:50,169
They're ready. Who is defending?

1764
01:02:50,169 --> 01:02:51,637
That's Jong Kook.

1765
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:53,539
- There. - Jong Kook is defending.

1766
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:55,108
- Yes. In the lines. - In the lines?

1767
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:56,709
- In the lines? - He's guarding the cans.

1768
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:58,778
(Guards: Jong Kook, Jin Young, Seok Jin, and Se Chan)

1769
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:00,113
(Chasers: Jae Seok and Ji Hyo)

1770
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:03,716
All right. Team Green, please go hide.

1771
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:09,756
(Team Green's strategy is to hide well and avoid physical fights.)

1772
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:11,758
(Hiding)

1773
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,827
Okay.

1774
01:03:14,827 --> 01:03:16,696
- Let me borrow your cap. - 30 seconds left.

1775
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,066
(Kwang Soo dresses up as a staff member.)

1776
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:24,137
(Haha is disguised in a referee's uniform.)

1777
01:03:26,439 --> 01:03:27,607
I'm of no help.

1778
01:03:28,641 --> 01:03:31,377
I need to run away to survive.

1779
01:03:31,377 --> 01:03:33,546
(I'd rather run away.)

1780
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:38,484
(Panting)

1781
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:42,221
(Han Na is wandering around the defense zone.)

1782
01:03:42,221 --> 01:03:43,890
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

1783
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,559
I'll push the opponents away...

1784
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,628
from inside the lines.

1785
01:03:48,628 --> 01:03:50,530
- Then you should touch them. - Okay.

1786
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,166
Do you get it? I'll throw them at you.

1787
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:56,369
- I'll throw them at you. - Okay.

1788
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:57,403
Touch them.

1789
01:03:57,403 --> 01:03:59,138
- You'll throw them at me? - Yes.

1790
01:03:59,138 --> 01:04:00,173
Okay.

1791
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:02,909
(Will my strategy fail?)

1792
01:04:03,543 --> 01:04:05,178
You have 10 seconds left.

1793
01:04:05,178 --> 01:04:06,179
(10 seconds left)

1794
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:08,414
10, 9,

1795
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,017
eight...

1796
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:18,091
(They won't be able to find me.)

1797
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:24,697
(Da Hee aims to win a point by not getting caught.)

1798
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:29,435
- 8, 7... - Hide.

1799
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:33,739
(Kwang Soo hides behind a cameraman.)

1800
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:34,841
Five,

1801
01:04:35,308 --> 01:04:36,375
four,

1802
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:39,078
3, 2...

1803
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,514
(3 seconds)

1804
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:44,884
2, 1. Start!

1805
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,154
Start!

1806
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:50,389
Hold on.

1807
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:51,624
- You took it off to quickly. - Jae Seok.

1808
01:04:51,657 --> 01:04:53,226
Here, Seok Jin and Jae Seok.

1809
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:55,094
- Jae Seok. - This wasn't my plan.

1810
01:04:55,828 --> 01:04:57,396
Let's eliminate her first.

1811
01:04:58,498 --> 01:04:59,999
- Hold on. - Don't move.

1812
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:01,300
Don't move.

1813
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:02,935
- Don't move. - Look at Han Na.

1814
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:04,971
Han Na is out.

1815
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:07,206
- Han Na is out? - She's out.

1816
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,575
- Have a seat. - Okay.

1817
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,613
(At the same time on the opposite side)

1818
01:05:13,613 --> 01:05:15,314
- What's that? - He's right here.

1819
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:19,018
(Sang Yeob was close to Seok Jin and Se Chan and got caught.)

1820
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:20,586
- This won't work. - Here.

1821
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:22,255
He's here, Jae Seok.

1822
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,224
(Jae Seok goes after Sang Yeob as soon as he hears Seok Jin.)

1823
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:27,660
I touched you.

1824
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,729
- Sang Yeob is out. - Oh, gosh.

1825
01:05:30,463 --> 01:05:33,299
(Meanwhile, So Min is in the mudflat.)

1826
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:35,168
What do I do?

1827
01:05:35,568 --> 01:05:36,669
What should I do?

1828
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,940
Goodness, I'm being dragged in. My feet.

1829
01:05:41,207 --> 01:05:42,775
What do I do? I can't move them.

1830
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:45,244
What do I do? Can you hold my hands?

1831
01:05:45,511 --> 01:05:47,513
What should I do? I'm done.

1832
01:05:47,513 --> 01:05:48,848
I can't move my feet.

1833
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,850
They could be hiding as a staff member.

1834
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:53,486
(Let's have a look.)

1835
01:05:56,622 --> 01:05:57,790
Touch.

1836
01:05:58,124 --> 01:05:59,225
You touched him?

1837
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,327
(Haha is out.)

1838
01:06:01,327 --> 01:06:02,995
- Haha is out. - How did you know?

1839
01:06:03,429 --> 01:06:05,998
Why would you point the camera right at me?

1840
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:09,202
(Hold on.)

1841
01:06:09,202 --> 01:06:11,537
(I got caught.)

1842
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:13,706
Go after him, Ji Hyo.

1843
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:15,041
He's by the camera.

1844
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,475
He's here.

1845
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:18,978
(He runs away.)

1846
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:20,279
- Come on. - Hey, Kwang Soo!

1847
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,083
(They both go in the mud.)

1848
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:26,619
Help me. My feet are stuck.

1849
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:29,889
(Help me! My feet are stuck!)

1850
01:06:29,922 --> 01:06:31,023
My feet are stuck.

1851
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:32,225
What is she doing?

1852
01:06:32,758 --> 01:06:34,327
What is she doing there?

1853
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:37,697
- My feet are stuck. What do I do? - Run away.

1854
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:39,198
(Stop there!)

1855
01:06:39,398 --> 01:06:41,167
- But my feet are stuck. - Run away!

1856
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,868
- But my feet are stuck. - Take them out!

1857
01:06:43,202 --> 01:06:44,337
(Take them out right now!)

1858
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:47,039
(I don't know anymore.)

1859
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,107
(I'm leaving first.)

1860
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:49,675
I'm done.

1861
01:06:49,809 --> 01:06:52,345
Hi, So Min.

1862
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:53,946
Kwang Soo.

1863
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:55,648
Hey!

1864
01:06:56,349 --> 01:06:57,416
Look at him.

1865
01:06:58,317 --> 01:06:59,585
Kwang Soo.

1866
01:06:59,852 --> 01:07:01,687
(I'm sorry,)

1867
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:04,824
(So Min.)

1868
01:07:04,824 --> 01:07:06,259
What do I do?

1869
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:07,827
The cameraman fell.

1870
01:07:07,994 --> 01:07:09,729
His feet got stuck.

1871
01:07:09,729 --> 01:07:11,330
(It's extremely difficult being Kwang Soo's cameraman.)

1872
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:14,367
Don't come!

1873
01:07:15,501 --> 01:07:18,437
Kwang Soo, don't cross that river!

1874
01:07:19,038 --> 01:07:20,673
Don't cross that river!

1875
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:22,408
(My love, don't cross that river.)

1876
01:07:22,408 --> 01:07:23,676
Please don't come!

1877
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:24,944
Go away!

1878
01:07:24,944 --> 01:07:26,545
(Panting)

1879
01:07:27,013 --> 01:07:28,748
- What if he goes to North Korea? - I know.

1880
01:07:28,748 --> 01:07:30,116
You'll get shot, Kwang Soo!

1881
01:07:30,249 --> 01:07:31,550
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1882
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:32,918
- You'll get shot. - Is that...

1883
01:07:32,918 --> 01:07:34,287
- North Korea? - Seok Jin.

1884
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:36,055
Stop.

1885
01:07:36,122 --> 01:07:37,590
Stop, Kwang Soo.

1886
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:39,525
Come back.

1887
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:41,827
- Kwang Soo. - I can't.

1888
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:43,562
- Kwang Soo. - Don't come!

1889
01:07:43,562 --> 01:07:46,632
Come back, Kwang Soo. Come back.

1890
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,768
- One minute remaining. - Stop it. Come back.

1891
01:07:48,968 --> 01:07:50,636
Please go!

1892
01:07:51,003 --> 01:07:52,338
I can't give up.

1893
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:54,340
Please.

1894
01:07:54,674 --> 01:07:56,709
Is that necessary?

1895
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:58,844
Does this game have to be that extreme?

1896
01:07:59,011 --> 01:08:00,346
10 seconds remaining.

1897
01:08:00,379 --> 01:08:01,547
10 seconds!

1898
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:03,616
Come back, Kwang Soo!

1899
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:05,518
10,

1900
01:08:06,152 --> 01:08:07,219
nine,

1901
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:08,387
- Did we catch them all? - eight,

1902
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:10,089
- It's over. - seven...

1903
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,158
Da Hee didn't get caught.

1904
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:13,859
(Cheering)

1905
01:08:16,062 --> 01:08:20,333
(Kicking)

1906
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,268
(Cheering)

1907
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:23,669
Four...

1908
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:25,271
(I did it!)

1909
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:26,706
2, 1.

1910
01:08:27,239 --> 01:08:31,143
(Team Green gets 1 can.)

1911
01:08:31,143 --> 01:08:32,278
- Haha. - This is it.

1912
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:33,879
(Haha, we finally did it!)

1913
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,514
Where's Kwang Soo?

1914
01:08:36,048 --> 01:08:37,516
- When is he coming back? - Kwang Soo,

1915
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:39,685
come back.

1916
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,421
- Come back, Kwang Soo. - Jae Seok.

1917
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,857
(They don't know it's over yet.)

1918
01:08:46,258 --> 01:08:48,394
(Panting)

1919
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:51,197
No!

1920
01:08:52,398 --> 01:08:53,933
Tell them it's over.

1921
01:08:53,933 --> 01:08:55,267
Kwang Soo and Jae Seok don't have to do that.

1922
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:56,569
Stop. Stop!

1923
01:08:57,169 --> 01:08:58,704
Tell them it's over.

1924
01:08:59,071 --> 01:09:01,107
(Jae Seok, please stop following me.)

1925
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:04,310
(A staff member runs to get them.)

1926
01:09:04,443 --> 01:09:06,345
- Hold on. - It's over.

1927
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:08,347
- Tell them to come back. - It's over!

1928
01:09:08,347 --> 01:09:09,548
Is it over?

1929
01:09:12,418 --> 01:09:14,587
(I did it!)

1930
01:09:15,087 --> 01:09:20,192
(Gosh, Kwang Soo.)

1931
01:09:20,192 --> 01:09:21,527
I'm sorry, Bo Pil.

1932
01:09:22,628 --> 01:09:23,829
Bo Pil, I...

1933
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:25,464
I'm sorry.

1934
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,166
Bo Pil,

1935
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,868
what are you doing?

1936
01:09:28,868 --> 01:09:30,269
(Flailing)

1937
01:09:30,269 --> 01:09:32,838
(Being a Running Man producer is a difficult job too.)

1938
01:09:34,073 --> 01:09:35,207
Hey.

1939
01:09:35,808 --> 01:09:37,376
Why is this necessary?

1940
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,545
This isn't supposed to be this extreme.

1941
01:09:39,879 --> 01:09:40,980
I'm sorry.

1942
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,348
I'm sorry.

1943
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:44,116
- Why would you do that? - Jae Seok.

1944
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,785
Look at the faces of the staff members.

1945
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:47,820
I'm sorry, everybody.

1946
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,489
Is this necessary?

1947
01:09:50,489 --> 01:09:51,590
I'm sorry.

1948
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:55,194
I lost my shoe.

1949
01:09:56,328 --> 01:09:57,496
Where is it?

1950
01:09:58,397 --> 01:09:59,565
It fell in the mud.

1951
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:03,469
We can't go this way.

1952
01:10:04,703 --> 01:10:06,338
- Okay, Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1953
01:10:06,572 --> 01:10:07,840
Let's go that way.

1954
01:10:09,341 --> 01:10:11,076
Oh, gosh.

1955
01:10:16,248 --> 01:10:17,817
Why would you do that?

1956
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:20,085
- My goodness. - Bo Pil, I'm sorry.

1957
01:10:20,252 --> 01:10:22,788
- I'm so sorry. - What are you doing?

1958
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:24,390
Bo Pil.

1959
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:27,226
- I'm sorry. - What are you doing?

1960
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:28,794
- Isn't that Bo Pil? - Did Kwang Soo survive?

1961
01:10:28,861 --> 01:10:30,696
- He did. - Yes.

1962
01:10:31,497 --> 01:10:33,032
I think he lost a shoe.

1963
01:10:33,032 --> 01:10:35,568
Do you have boots on?

1964
01:10:35,868 --> 01:10:39,839
Hey. Look at Bo Pil. He's a mess.

1965
01:10:40,139 --> 01:10:41,207
What happened?

1966
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,609
- He cursed at me so much. - What did he say?

1967
01:10:43,609 --> 01:10:45,277
"This isn't supposed to be this extreme!"

1968
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:49,415
Can you find my shoe, Bo Pil?

1969
01:10:50,249 --> 01:10:51,650
It's not mine. It's sponsored.

1970
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:54,687
- Oh, dear. - Are they looking for his shoe?

1971
01:10:54,987 --> 01:10:56,155
He tricked me.

1972
01:10:56,388 --> 01:10:57,890
I'm sorry, everybody!

1973
01:10:58,757 --> 01:11:00,359
I'm sorry, everybody!

1974
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:02,495
It wouldn't matter if it was my shoe,

1975
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:04,964
but it's sponsored!

1976
01:11:05,798 --> 01:11:08,667
(They are in the mud, looking for his shoe.)

1977
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:09,869
Everybody!

1978
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:13,138
The sun is setting. Please hurry up.

1979
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,074
Let's do this, everybody!

1980
01:11:15,508 --> 01:11:16,775
It was on that side.

1981
01:11:18,177 --> 01:11:20,379
3 on the left, 2 on the right.

1982
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:21,847
Divide yourselves up.

1983
01:11:22,882 --> 01:11:24,016
They found it.

1984
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:25,618
They found it!

1985
01:11:27,453 --> 01:11:30,089
(It's almost as if they found his long-lost mother.)

1986
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:32,324
Thank you! Is the shoe okay?

1987
01:11:33,092 --> 01:11:35,294
Is it okay? Thank you!

1988
01:11:35,628 --> 01:11:37,429
After five minutes,

1989
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:40,332
Kwang Soo and Da Hee survived, so that's two points.

1990
01:11:40,332 --> 01:11:41,967
Da Hee kicked a can,

1991
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:43,569
so that's five points in total.

1992
01:11:43,569 --> 01:11:44,603
Yes.

1993
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:46,305
We should have said no...

1994
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:48,274
- to going into the mudflat. - You're right.

1995
01:11:48,274 --> 01:11:50,309
- I'm sorry. - Across from there,

1996
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:53,145
Kwang Soo and I looked in this direction. The entire staff...

1997
01:11:53,712 --> 01:11:55,481
(They were thinking, "Why is he doing this?")

1998
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:56,815
- Really? - Yes.

1999
01:11:56,982 --> 01:11:58,050
"Why is that necessary?"

2000
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,185
- That's true. - "That's going overboard."

2001
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,187
I'm sorry, everybody.

2002
01:12:02,321 --> 01:12:04,256
It's okay. You looked cool.

2003
01:12:05,791 --> 01:12:09,428
The same rules apply. Team Green will defend.

2004
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:12,197
1 or 2 people...

2005
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:14,500
could go around...

2006
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,936
to distract them. It's not a bad strategy.

2007
01:12:16,969 --> 01:12:18,103
It's not necessary.

2008
01:12:18,103 --> 01:12:20,573
- Do 3 on 3? - That's the best way.

2009
01:12:20,573 --> 01:12:22,207
Jae Seok,

2010
01:12:22,207 --> 01:12:24,410
this will be over in two seconds.

2011
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,878
(What is Team Pink's 2-second strategy?)

2012
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:27,346
It won't last long.

2013
01:12:27,513 --> 01:12:28,647
- It's a dark tunnel. - It isn't.

2014
01:12:28,647 --> 01:12:31,016
The tunnel never ends.

2015
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,651
I want to wake up from this nightmare.

2016
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:34,520
- Me too. - I'm having a night terror.

2017
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,955
Wake up. Wake up.

2018
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:37,156
I feel helpless.

2019
01:12:37,423 --> 01:12:38,624
I don't think anything will work.

2020
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:40,559
- Let's have fun. - What do we do?

2021
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,895
Let's end this on a successful note.

2022
01:12:43,963 --> 01:12:46,332
It was great being on the same team with you guys.

2023
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:47,800
I had fun.

2024
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:48,767
- We worked hard. - I have no regrets.

2025
01:12:48,767 --> 01:12:49,868
- I have no regrets. - Me too.

2026
01:12:49,868 --> 01:12:51,637
We were the best warriors today.

2027
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:53,539
- You are all warriors. - Warriors.

2028
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:56,575
We already won. We won by ourselves.

2029
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:59,111
We are the real victors.

2030
01:12:59,111 --> 01:13:00,512
- See you again. - Let's get together after.

2031
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:01,647
We'll have a team dinner.

2032
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,048
Let's eat noodle soup with seafood.

2033
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:05,117
In 1, 2, 3.

2034
01:13:05,117 --> 01:13:06,218
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2035
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:08,120
- This is sad. - Let's do this.

2036
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,488
This makes me tear up.

2037
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:11,857
Please take positions, and put the blindfolds on.

2038
01:13:11,857 --> 01:13:13,859
- They'll hide then. - I'll go left, and you go right.

2039
01:13:15,127 --> 01:13:18,497
(Sang Yeob and Han Na are in the left defense zone.)

2040
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:20,099
- Da Hee. - We just can't touch it.

2041
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:22,001
(Da Hee and Kwang Soo crouch in the right defense zone.)

2042
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:24,670
Why are you going back and forth in front of me? It's scary.

2043
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:25,838
Everybody.

2044
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:27,339
Nobody...

2045
01:13:27,473 --> 01:13:29,108
Nobody knows yet.

2046
01:13:29,108 --> 01:13:30,509
I'm going to tear up.

2047
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:32,378
Let's try our best until the end!

2048
01:13:32,578 --> 01:13:33,879
We can win!

2049
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,415
It's not over until it's over.

2050
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:37,816
I loved you guys!

2051
01:13:38,817 --> 01:13:40,986
I loved you all!

2052
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,588
10,

2053
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:44,089
nine,

2054
01:13:44,089 --> 01:13:45,958
8, 7,

2055
01:13:45,991 --> 01:13:47,526
- Haha. - Let's do our best.

2056
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,294
Five,

2057
01:13:49,528 --> 01:13:50,729
four,

2058
01:13:50,863 --> 01:13:52,064
three,

2059
01:13:52,197 --> 01:13:53,365
two,

2060
01:13:53,532 --> 01:13:54,767
one.

2061
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,568
What's this?

2062
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:58,937
(1 second)

2063
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:00,139
(2 seconds)

2064
01:14:00,139 --> 01:14:02,975
(Kicking)

2065
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,377
It's over.

2066
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:07,079
(They kick 1 can in just 2 seconds.)

2067
01:14:07,079 --> 01:14:08,514
Run away.

2068
01:14:08,647 --> 01:14:10,649
(What about the right defense zone?)

2069
01:14:10,649 --> 01:14:11,717
One.

2070
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:14,019
(Pulling)

2071
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:17,656
(Struggling)

2072
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,458
Catch one.

2073
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:21,627
(Da Hee and Kwang Soo resist.)

2074
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:23,195
(My gosh)

2075
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:24,997
Touch them.

2076
01:14:25,898 --> 01:14:26,965
Touch them.

2077
01:14:27,099 --> 01:14:29,334
(Kicking)

2078
01:14:30,669 --> 01:14:33,939
(Team Pink gets 10 points in 22 seconds, and it's game over.)

2079
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:35,207
Let's celebrate.

2080
01:14:35,207 --> 01:14:37,409
That was so easy.

2081
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:39,311
That was easy.

2082
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:41,046
- Why would you run to the mudflat? - Let's go.

2083
01:14:42,247 --> 01:14:45,384
(They get both cans by going straight for them.)

2084
01:14:46,118 --> 01:14:48,987
(This hurts my pride.)

2085
01:14:49,588 --> 01:14:50,789
That was...

2086
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:52,291
That was such a simple game.

2087
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:53,659
This is how you play the game.

2088
01:14:53,659 --> 01:14:55,794
- This is how you play it. - Why would you run to the mud?

2089
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:58,230
(Goodness)

2090
01:14:58,230 --> 01:14:59,465
I'm so mad.

2091
01:14:59,498 --> 01:15:00,866
I'm so mad!

2092
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,001
Hey, rather than doing this,

2093
01:15:03,001 --> 01:15:05,604
- we should have just stood outside. - I'm so mad.

2094
01:15:06,271 --> 01:15:07,339
I'm so mad.

2095
01:15:07,339 --> 01:15:08,407
(Punching)

2096
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:10,209
So Min.

2097
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:12,544
So Min,

2098
01:15:12,711 --> 01:15:14,012
- this is how you play the game. - Jae Seok.

2099
01:15:14,012 --> 01:15:15,080
- So Min... - Jae Seok.

2100
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,117
Jae Seok, you... Jae Seok.

2101
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:20,085
(Kicking)

2102
01:15:21,019 --> 01:15:23,489
(I took my anger out.)

2103
01:15:23,489 --> 01:15:25,958
You earned 10 points in just 22 seconds.

2104
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:28,327
(Team Pink earns 10 points in 22 seconds with 2 cans.)

2105
01:15:28,327 --> 01:15:29,328
That was so simple.

2106
01:15:29,328 --> 01:15:31,396
We work so well together.

2107
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,699
Jin Young grabbed my hair. Is that allowed?

2108
01:15:33,832 --> 01:15:35,968
- Is that okay? - You should've ripped the name tag.

2109
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:38,070
- How? - You should have.

2110
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,371
That's the rule.

2111
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:40,639
Take the Shuddering Stickers.

2112
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:42,407
Gosh, Shuddering Stickers.

2113
01:15:42,441 --> 01:15:43,609
Yes.

2114
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:44,977
We have to go in the house now.

2115
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,080
Team Pink also gets the last chance to steal.

2116
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,248
Take it all!

2117
01:15:49,948 --> 01:15:51,884
(Take it all!)

2118
01:15:53,352 --> 01:15:56,088
But there aren't that many things bigger than that.

2119
01:15:56,088 --> 01:15:58,824
Team Pink has to bring something bigger than the door.

2120
01:15:59,558 --> 01:16:01,660
- There's nothing bigger than that. - It has to be the door.

2121
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:03,195
- Ready. - Okay.

2122
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:04,797
- Set... - This is so much fun.

2123
01:16:05,397 --> 01:16:06,832
- I am lucky today. - Let's go.

2124
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:08,433
- Let's do this. - What should we steal?

2125
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:09,935
- What can we take? - In any case,

2126
01:16:10,068 --> 01:16:12,137
we can't take this.

2127
01:16:12,137 --> 01:16:13,739
Is this smaller than the door?

2128
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:15,174
It is smaller.

2129
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,042
What about the sofa, mattress, or the curtain?

2130
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:18,610
- Does the sofa work? - Don't you think...

2131
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,912
- they would've picked the sofa? - Lift it.

2132
01:16:19,912 --> 01:16:21,647
- I can lift it. - We can carry it.

2133
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:25,117
Jong Kook, do you think they picked the pole?

2134
01:16:25,117 --> 01:16:26,218
Really? This pole?

2135
01:16:26,218 --> 01:16:27,252
(The curtain pole is the 2nd candidate.)

2136
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:29,655
- I don't think they picked it. - The pole?

2137
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:32,391
- The curtain works too. - Right.

2138
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:34,660
They might've not thought about the pole.

2139
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,928
(Is it the curtain pole or the curtain?)

2140
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:37,596
Two minutes remaining.

2141
01:16:38,063 --> 01:16:39,464
- Two minutes remaining. - Se Chan.

2142
01:16:39,998 --> 01:16:41,300
You don't have too much time left.

2143
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,068
- Hurry. - We have two minutes left.

2144
01:16:43,068 --> 01:16:44,703
- We're in trouble. - Blanket, mattress, curtain...

2145
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:46,405
- Choose one. - The curtain.

2146
01:16:46,538 --> 01:16:48,607
- The curtain. - Should we take this?

2147
01:16:48,607 --> 01:16:50,142
- The curtain. - Let's take it off.

2148
01:16:50,142 --> 01:16:52,144
The curtain or the pole. Decide.

2149
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:53,879
- We can take it off. - There's no time.

2150
01:16:53,879 --> 01:16:55,247
You have no time for that.

2151
01:16:57,583 --> 01:16:58,717
- Seok Jin. - Yes.

2152
01:16:58,717 --> 01:16:59,952
Isn't this better?

2153
01:16:59,952 --> 01:17:01,453
- The pole won't come off. - The pole?

2154
01:17:01,453 --> 01:17:03,388
Why wouldn't it come off? It comes off.

2155
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:04,556
Take it off.

2156
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,491
(Goodness)

2157
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:08,060
- See? - Come in the room.

2158
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,128
- They took the pole off. - They took the curtain off.

2159
01:17:10,128 --> 01:17:11,730
It's not the curtain. It's the pole.

2160
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:13,699
(Why is Team Green sensitive about the curtain or the pole?)

2161
01:17:14,032 --> 01:17:15,534
(I vote for the curtain.)

2162
01:17:16,468 --> 01:17:17,870
(Or we can do the pole.)

2163
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:21,707
(Team Green also hesitated between the curtain and the pole.)

2164
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:26,144
(They took a picture of one of them.)

2165
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:30,716
(Did Team Green choose the curtain or the pole?)

2166
01:17:30,782 --> 01:17:33,518
- The curtain pole. - They took it?

2167
01:17:33,819 --> 01:17:34,920
They took off the curtain pole.

2168
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,988
Good. Take it.

2169
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:37,089
Should we choose the curtain or the pole?

2170
01:17:37,089 --> 01:17:38,357
- I got it. - Decide.

2171
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:39,925
- Do this. - Should we do the curtain or this?

2172
01:17:39,958 --> 01:17:42,127
- Curtain pole. - Let's take both and decide.

2173
01:17:42,127 --> 01:17:43,996
- Take both and decide. - Go. Take the curtain.

2174
01:17:44,529 --> 01:17:45,697
- Go. Take the curtain. - The pole came off?

2175
01:17:45,697 --> 01:17:48,433
- Let's take both and decide. - They went in the room.

2176
01:17:48,767 --> 01:17:50,135
What is it?

2177
01:17:50,569 --> 01:17:52,137
We have to decide on one.

2178
01:17:52,137 --> 01:17:53,639
- What should we choose? - We have to decide.

2179
01:17:53,972 --> 01:17:55,841
You have to put it in your room before the time's up.

2180
01:17:55,841 --> 01:17:57,709
- What should we do? - Jae Seok, which one do we choose?

2181
01:17:57,709 --> 01:17:59,478
- Let's do the pole. - Should we do this one?

2182
01:17:59,478 --> 01:18:00,679
- Just choose one. - Let's choose the pole.

2183
01:18:00,679 --> 01:18:01,947
- I'll put it in our room. - No.

2184
01:18:01,947 --> 01:18:03,448
- Let's do the pole. - I'll put it in our room.

2185
01:18:03,448 --> 01:18:04,583
- I'll take this one. - No.

2186
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:05,918
- The pole. - Choose that one.

2187
01:18:05,918 --> 01:18:07,219
This one?

2188
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:09,288
Are we going to be on the same team next week?

2189
01:18:09,288 --> 01:18:11,823
Good work.

2190
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:12,991
In 1, 2, 3.

2191
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,126
(They celebrate their 3 losses and do a cheer.)

2192
01:18:14,259 --> 01:18:15,460
You can only take one.

2193
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,229
- 15 seconds left. - Choose the curtain then.

2194
01:18:17,229 --> 01:18:18,230
- The curtain. - Yes.

2195
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,698
Choose the curtain then.

2196
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:21,066
- The curtain. - Yes.

2197
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:23,869
(Team Pink chooses the curtain at the end.)

2198
01:18:24,469 --> 01:18:26,605
It would work. If you open it, it's really big.

2199
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:30,108
You moved the item on time.

2200
01:18:30,108 --> 01:18:31,743
- You took the curtain, right? - Yes.

2201
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:34,246
That's the item you took.

2202
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:37,182
On the opposing team's Shuddering List...

2203
01:18:37,182 --> 01:18:40,786
(Was the curtain on Team Green's list?)

2204
01:18:41,987 --> 01:18:45,324
(Curtain or the curtain pole. What's the result?)

2205
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:47,259
It was not included.

2206
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:50,228
(Team Pink steals it successfully.)

2207
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:51,930
What about the pole?

2208
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,899
(How about the pole?)

2209
01:18:53,899 --> 01:18:54,967
It was on the list.

2210
01:18:55,767 --> 01:18:58,804
(The curtain pole was on Team Green's Shuddering List.)

2211
01:18:58,971 --> 01:19:02,207
(They had a hard time deciding between the curtain and the pole.)

2212
01:19:03,508 --> 01:19:05,310
(At the end,)

2213
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,546
(they decided on the curtain pole.)

2214
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:10,182
(That's too bad.)

2215
01:19:10,182 --> 01:19:12,017
Seok Jin.

2216
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:14,152
We would have lost if he didn't speak up.

2217
01:19:14,152 --> 01:19:15,320
- I almost left. - I told you.

2218
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:17,622
They might not have taken a picture of it.

2219
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:20,158
- I thought we got it. - Seok Jin went in the room.

2220
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:22,494
This team gets Luxury Stickers again.

2221
01:19:23,462 --> 01:19:25,998
We have the results of Steal House and Get Out Race,

2222
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:27,132
and in order to distribute the stickers,

2223
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:29,735
we'll play Line Stealer.

2224
01:19:30,569 --> 01:19:31,737
"Line Stealer"?

2225
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:33,972
Each member will throw their shoe...

2226
01:19:33,972 --> 01:19:36,274
and will be ranked according to how close they are to the line.

2227
01:19:36,308 --> 01:19:37,609
Luxury Stickers will be given to the winners,

2228
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:40,245
and Shuddering Stickers will be given to the losers.

2229
01:19:40,379 --> 01:19:42,080
It means that for this team,

2230
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,282
five people who are closest to the line...

2231
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:45,784
- get Luxury Stickers. - That's right.

2232
01:19:46,018 --> 01:19:47,719
One person will get a Shuddering Sticker.

2233
01:19:48,387 --> 01:19:50,022
I am really bad at this.

2234
01:19:50,022 --> 01:19:51,289
I won't lose.

2235
01:19:51,289 --> 01:19:52,858
It would be better if the game is based on luck.

2236
01:19:52,858 --> 01:19:54,626
This is not based on luck.

2237
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,228
You never know.

2238
01:19:56,228 --> 01:19:59,698
For this team, three people who are the farthest away lose.

2239
01:19:59,698 --> 01:20:01,333
If you're closer to the line, you get a chance.

2240
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:03,168
- Is it 2 or 3 people? - You have to be closer to the line?

2241
01:20:03,168 --> 01:20:05,637
So Min, we have to win.

2242
01:20:05,637 --> 01:20:07,539
This is the last game.

2243
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:09,408
Let's get started.

2244
01:20:09,408 --> 01:20:11,009
(Who will get the Shuddering Stickers?)

2245
01:20:11,109 --> 01:20:12,511
What if you pass the line?

2246
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,179
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

2247
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:16,248
- Who would like to start? - So Min first.

2248
01:20:16,248 --> 01:20:18,050
- So Min first. - No, he's going first.

2249
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,684
- Sang Yeob first. - She's going after him.

2250
01:20:19,718 --> 01:20:21,453
We're next to each other again.

2251
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:24,756
I'm sick of Sang Yeob.

2252
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,858
I thought you were in love with him.

2253
01:20:26,858 --> 01:20:28,627
- Why are you sick of him? - That was quick.

2254
01:20:28,627 --> 01:20:30,028
You wanted to be a couple with him on the first day.

2255
01:20:30,028 --> 01:20:32,497
Hey, you're not the only one.

2256
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:34,900
I'm scared too.

2257
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,368
Go.

2258
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,969
I can do this.

2259
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:39,271
- Wait. - Just take the Shuddering Sticker.

2260
01:20:39,271 --> 01:20:40,839
- I can really do this. - Take the Shuddering Sticker.

2261
01:20:40,839 --> 01:20:42,607
Just take it.

2262
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:43,875
That was beautiful.

2263
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:45,143
Kick it hard.

2264
01:20:46,978 --> 01:20:48,780
(Kicking)

2265
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,848
Too short.

2266
01:20:52,818 --> 01:20:55,187
(He couldn't control the force.)

2267
01:20:55,187 --> 01:20:56,455
We just have to pass him.

2268
01:20:56,588 --> 01:20:58,056
- Okay. - Good job.

2269
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:00,425
- Okay. - It's too far.

2270
01:21:00,459 --> 01:21:03,261
- You got intimidated. - But this...

2271
01:21:03,261 --> 01:21:04,996
- No way. - No, no.

2272
01:21:04,996 --> 01:21:07,132
(He can't get near it.)

2273
01:21:07,132 --> 01:21:08,366
What are you doing?

2274
01:21:08,567 --> 01:21:09,768
My gosh.

2275
01:21:10,068 --> 01:21:11,636
- So Min. - So Min.

2276
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,371
- So Min. - You stepped on the line.

2277
01:21:13,371 --> 01:21:14,739
(She comes out of nowhere.)

2278
01:21:14,873 --> 01:21:16,708
(Da Hee starts interfering with So Min.)

2279
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,610
Kick it hard.

2280
01:21:18,610 --> 01:21:21,279
(She's being annoying.)

2281
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,714
Put it next to Sang Yeob's.

2282
01:21:22,747 --> 01:21:23,849
What?

2283
01:21:24,649 --> 01:21:25,717
Put it next to...

2284
01:21:26,017 --> 01:21:28,720
(So Min punches her.)

2285
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:31,156
(What just happened?)

2286
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:32,390
(I'm sorry, Da Hee.)

2287
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:33,658
I'm sorry.

2288
01:21:33,658 --> 01:21:34,960
Hey.

2289
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,428
I got so mad.

2290
01:21:36,428 --> 01:21:38,330
I got mad at Da Hee.

2291
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,066
- So Min. - Fart Lady.

2292
01:21:41,766 --> 01:21:43,935
- Let's go, Fart Lady. - Put it next to his.

2293
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:46,505
(Fart Lady is ready.)

2294
01:21:46,738 --> 01:21:48,039
- Sang Yeob. - Hey.

2295
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:49,908
Fart Booster.

2296
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:54,513
(They cheer for the Fart Lady.)

2297
01:21:54,513 --> 01:21:57,115
So Min wasn't singing, but I heard a sound.

2298
01:21:57,782 --> 01:22:00,986
(She didn't move her mouth. Where did the sound come from?)

2299
01:22:01,319 --> 01:22:03,355
I have to get married.

2300
01:22:03,388 --> 01:22:05,357
- I have to get married. - You can get married.

2301
01:22:05,357 --> 01:22:07,559
Go to the Shuddering Package first.

2302
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:08,927
- So Min. - Put it next to his.

2303
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:10,262
I can't focus.

2304
01:22:10,262 --> 01:22:11,730
- I'll be careful. - It won't be good enough.

2305
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:12,864
In 1, 2, 3.

2306
01:22:14,132 --> 01:22:15,300
She did it.

2307
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,468
(Nice shot)

2308
01:22:16,468 --> 01:22:17,569
Good shot.

2309
01:22:17,569 --> 01:22:19,404
- In 1, 2, 3. - She did it.

2310
01:22:19,838 --> 01:22:23,875
(You can see how much she wants to avoid the Shuddering Sticker.)

2311
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,678
(So Min is currently in 1st place.)

2312
01:22:26,678 --> 01:22:28,280
- Good shot. - Good shot.

2313
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,414
What?

2314
01:22:29,648 --> 01:22:31,049
- Good shot. - So Min won.

2315
01:22:31,349 --> 01:22:33,018
Nice, Fart Lady.

2316
01:22:33,318 --> 01:22:35,787
She's good when you talk about farting.

2317
01:22:35,787 --> 01:22:36,888
Hey.

2318
01:22:38,456 --> 01:22:39,491
Next.

2319
01:22:39,491 --> 01:22:41,059
Kwang Soo's shoes are in pain.

2320
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:43,128
They're in pain.

2321
01:22:43,161 --> 01:22:44,529
My shoes are still not good.

2322
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:46,965
- You'll have the energy of the mud. - This will be fun.

2323
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:49,167
Are his shoes stuck to his feet?

2324
01:22:49,167 --> 01:22:51,069
- He lost. - You have the energy of the mud.

2325
01:22:51,069 --> 01:22:52,404
He lost already.

2326
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:54,539
He's done. He lost the mental game.

2327
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:55,807
- Kick it hard. - He lost the mental game already.

2328
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:56,908
Stop it.

2329
01:22:56,908 --> 01:22:58,310
(Take it easy.)

2330
01:22:58,310 --> 01:22:59,878
Let me give it a try.

2331
01:22:59,878 --> 01:23:00,946
Okay.

2332
01:23:01,213 --> 01:23:03,848
I think he's going to kick it in the air, and it'll land here.

2333
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:05,417
- He's uglier when he focuses. - He's so ugly.

2334
01:23:05,417 --> 01:23:06,718
Kwang Soo is also...

2335
01:23:06,718 --> 01:23:08,620
- Why is he standing like that? - Were his legs always that short?

2336
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,921
- I know. - Kwang Soo...

2337
01:23:09,921 --> 01:23:11,489
(Spitting)

2338
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:13,758
He spat at us.

2339
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:16,228
(The Shuddering Sticker depends on this.)

2340
01:23:16,228 --> 01:23:18,597
- I'll go. Okay. - He spat at us.

2341
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:20,198
Kwang Soo didn't gel his hair,

2342
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:21,666
so he looks like an idiot.

2343
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:22,767
- That's a bad spot. - I know.

2344
01:23:22,767 --> 01:23:24,236
(He makes up his mind and kicks.)

2345
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:26,137
- That's a bad spot. - I know.

2346
01:23:28,807 --> 01:23:30,542
It's not bad.

2347
01:23:30,542 --> 01:23:31,710
(It lands in between Sang Yeob's and So Min's.)

2348
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,079
It's not bad.

2349
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:35,580
This is not bad.

2350
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:37,249
Move, Kwang Soo.

2351
01:23:37,249 --> 01:23:38,350
I'm looking forward to this.

2352
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:39,918
Da Hee has big shoes, so she'll be fine.

2353
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:41,219
I don't think it'll be easy for her.

2354
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:43,188
- One person will lose. - I know exactly what to do.

2355
01:23:43,188 --> 01:23:44,889
If you do this, it bounces back.

2356
01:23:44,889 --> 01:23:46,358
It springs back like this.

2357
01:23:46,358 --> 01:23:47,425
(If you kick it straight, it bounces back.)

2358
01:23:47,859 --> 01:23:49,261
- It comes back. - This...

2359
01:23:49,261 --> 01:23:50,662
- It does. - It bounces back.

2360
01:23:50,662 --> 01:23:52,230
It goes forward then comes back.

2361
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,498
This looks fun.

2362
01:23:53,498 --> 01:23:56,134
(She watches Kwang Soo carefully.)

2363
01:23:57,102 --> 01:23:58,270
- So... - How do you do it?

2364
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:00,038
it's better to kick it sideways.

2365
01:24:00,939 --> 01:24:02,507
I think it's a good idea.

2366
01:24:02,507 --> 01:24:04,109
This is really good. Let me borrow your shoulder.

2367
01:24:04,109 --> 01:24:05,977
It's going to roll in front of her.

2368
01:24:05,977 --> 01:24:06,978
(This is the chance to show her move...)

2369
01:24:06,978 --> 01:24:08,480
(after observing the others.)

2370
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,148
See? Look.

2371
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:11,216
See? I told you.

2372
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:12,617
I told you.

2373
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:14,719
(Da Hee is currently in last place.)

2374
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,554
See? I told you.

2375
01:24:16,988 --> 01:24:18,089
I told you.

2376
01:24:18,123 --> 01:24:19,724
- This doesn't work. - Yes.

2377
01:24:20,058 --> 01:24:21,059
- This won't work. - No.

2378
01:24:21,059 --> 01:24:22,927
- You can't touch it. - Move.

2379
01:24:22,927 --> 01:24:25,330
- I told you. - Can I try like this?

2380
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:26,765
- That was so bad. - No way.

2381
01:24:26,798 --> 01:24:27,932
It rolls like that.

2382
01:24:27,932 --> 01:24:30,835
This is pretty intense.

2383
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:32,637
I'm next.

2384
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:34,439
Haha, you don't have to worry.

2385
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:36,408
There's hope.

2386
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:37,475
(Kicking)

2387
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:41,179
(He lands in 3rd place.)

2388
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:42,514
- Nice! - Oh, gosh.

2389
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:46,151
(Haha is in 3rd place.)

2390
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:47,218
What just happened?

2391
01:24:47,218 --> 01:24:50,088
(Kwang Soo and So Min get to choose the briefcases.)

2392
01:24:50,088 --> 01:24:51,990
- Congratulations. - Han Na.

2393
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:54,426
No way! What have I done?

2394
01:24:55,827 --> 01:24:57,228
(Han Na is the last one to go.)

2395
01:24:57,228 --> 01:24:59,097
- Han Na hasn't gone yet. - Han Na.

2396
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:00,598
It will be over if Han Na's shoe falls here.

2397
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:01,900
Seriously.

2398
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,235
(The fate of Team Green lies on Han Na's shoe.)

2399
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,238
(So Min is 1st, Kwang Soo is 2nd, and Haha is 3rd.)

2400
01:25:07,238 --> 01:25:08,406
What have I done?

2401
01:25:10,108 --> 01:25:12,277
(If Han Na is in 3rd place,)

2402
01:25:12,277 --> 01:25:13,278
Han Na!

2403
01:25:13,278 --> 01:25:15,280
(So Min, Kwang Soo, and Han Na get to choose the briefcases.)

2404
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,616
(If not, So Min, Kwang Soo, and Haha get to choose the briefcases.)

2405
01:25:20,819 --> 01:25:23,221
Oh, yes! This is incredible.

2406
01:25:23,221 --> 01:25:25,657
Is Han Na's shoe farther away from the line?

2407
01:25:25,657 --> 01:25:26,758
Let's measure the distance.

2408
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:27,759
(The result is unclear to the naked eye.)

2409
01:25:27,759 --> 01:25:28,827
Measure the distance from Han Na's shoe.

2410
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,995
It's nowhere close to the line.

2411
01:25:31,029 --> 01:25:32,297
The distance is similar.

2412
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:34,699
90cm.

2413
01:25:34,699 --> 01:25:36,000
(Han Na's shoe is 90cm away from the line.)

2414
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,068
I don't know the result.

2415
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:38,269
(Haha is in 3rd place...)

2416
01:25:38,269 --> 01:25:39,237
I don't know the result.

2417
01:25:39,237 --> 01:25:40,372
(if his shoe is less than 90cm away from the line.)

2418
01:25:40,372 --> 01:25:42,974
(Who is in 3rd place?)

2419
01:25:43,007 --> 01:25:44,642
- This is neck-and-neck. - 60cm.

2420
01:25:44,642 --> 01:25:46,878
(Haha's shoe is 60cm away from the line.)

2421
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:48,113
60cm. You won.

2422
01:25:48,113 --> 01:25:49,147
Haha.

2423
01:25:49,147 --> 01:25:50,815
(Haha is in 3rd place.)

2424
01:25:52,717 --> 01:25:54,285
He survived.

2425
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:57,222
Only one of you will get a Luxury Sticker.

2426
01:25:57,222 --> 01:25:58,590
The rest of you will get a Shuddering Sticker.

2427
01:25:58,590 --> 01:26:00,759
- Only one of you will get it. - Only one of you.

2428
01:26:00,759 --> 01:26:03,294
- Really? - Only one of you will get it.

2429
01:26:03,328 --> 01:26:04,696
Don't be so sure of yourself.

2430
01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:07,365
Becoming the loser in this team will hurt.

2431
01:26:07,399 --> 01:26:09,334
- Seriously. - It will hurt.

2432
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:12,036
- Jong Kook will go first. - Okay.

2433
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:14,239
Becoming the loser in this team will be the saddest.

2434
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,141
- You know, - It will be really sad.

2435
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:19,177
becoming the loser in this team will be the saddest.

2436
01:26:19,177 --> 01:26:20,445
(Then you get a Shuddering Sticker despite winning the race.)

2437
01:26:21,079 --> 01:26:23,181
- Shall I go? - Yes.

2438
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:24,616
(He is cool-headed.)

2439
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:26,918
(Throwing a shoe is a piece of cake.)

2440
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:30,021
- Put yourself at ease. - I will do that.

2441
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,222
(The thrower is at ease,)

2442
01:26:31,222 --> 01:26:33,324
(but the onlookers are nervous.)

2443
01:26:34,559 --> 01:26:36,828
(There is no need to worry too much about throwing a shoe.)

2444
01:26:36,828 --> 01:26:38,129
- My goodness. - What?

2445
01:26:38,396 --> 01:26:40,131
- My goodness. - What?

2446
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:42,734
(A total disaster)

2447
01:26:44,202 --> 01:26:45,303
What was that?

2448
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:47,238
- He is ruined. - What was that?

2449
01:26:47,238 --> 01:26:48,339
It didn't even go halfway.

2450
01:26:48,339 --> 01:26:49,374
(My goodness.)

2451
01:26:49,607 --> 01:26:51,743
- What was that? - Stay still.

2452
01:26:51,776 --> 01:26:53,878
(They celebrate in silence so as not to anger Jong Kook.)

2453
01:26:53,878 --> 01:26:56,514
- Don't move. - What was that?

2454
01:26:56,748 --> 01:26:57,916
What was that?

2455
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,018
- Oh no. - Did Jong Kook really do that?

2456
01:27:00,018 --> 01:27:02,120
Stay still. Stay still.

2457
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,421
(I am sure you remember what they said earlier.)

2458
01:27:03,421 --> 01:27:07,859
(The worst is losing due to a shoe after winning the race.)

2459
01:27:07,892 --> 01:27:11,095
(I can't believe it happened to me.)

2460
01:27:11,896 --> 01:27:13,631
- The loser has been decided. - Is that really Jong Kook's shoe?

2461
01:27:13,631 --> 01:27:14,766
The loser has been decided.

2462
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,368
- Hold on. I can't believe this. - Jae Seok!

2463
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:19,737
- This is the best. - I worked hard all day.

2464
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:21,539
I know. You worked hard all day.

2465
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:23,475
Only a fool wouldn't be able to get it past halfway.

2466
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,310
- I am next. - Ji Hyo is next.

2467
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:27,278
- Put yourself at ease. - There you go.

2468
01:27:27,278 --> 01:27:28,379
(Ji Hyo got hers past his.)

2469
01:27:28,379 --> 01:27:29,948
- Put yourself at ease. - There you go.

2470
01:27:29,948 --> 01:27:31,049
All right.

2471
01:27:31,749 --> 01:27:32,917
All right.

2472
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:33,985
My goodness.

2473
01:27:34,752 --> 01:27:36,120
Stop it.

2474
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:38,089
Good shot!

2475
01:27:38,089 --> 01:27:39,257
- It was great. - Okay.

2476
01:27:39,257 --> 01:27:41,426
Jong Kook sacrificed himself.

2477
01:27:41,459 --> 01:27:43,094
He is a good man.

2478
01:27:43,728 --> 01:27:47,098
(Who will take the remaining three slots?)

2479
01:27:48,299 --> 01:27:52,270
There is only one opening for the Luxury Package.

2480
01:27:52,270 --> 01:27:53,638
(1 of the 3 briefcases contain it.)

2481
01:27:53,638 --> 01:27:55,406
This is a game of luck.

2482
01:27:56,241 --> 01:27:57,475
Which one will you choose?

2483
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:00,044
I choose this one.

2484
01:28:00,678 --> 01:28:01,746
So Min should choose next.

2485
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,349
I am sorry but...

2486
01:28:04,349 --> 01:28:06,451
- Let go of your expectations. - 1, 2, 3.

2487
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:07,986
(What is inside Kwang Soo's briefcase?)

2488
01:28:26,604 --> 01:28:29,073
I am sorry but...

2489
01:28:29,073 --> 01:28:31,142
- Let go of your expectations. - 1, 2, 3.

2490
01:28:31,142 --> 01:28:32,310
(What is inside Kwang Soo's briefcase?)

2491
01:28:33,044 --> 01:28:34,612
(He gets the Shuddering Package.)

2492
01:28:35,747 --> 01:28:36,948
See?

2493
01:28:36,948 --> 01:28:38,316
I told you to choose this briefcase.

2494
01:28:38,316 --> 01:28:39,684
- It's done. - Shuddering Package!

2495
01:28:39,684 --> 01:28:41,152
- Take it out. - Congratulations.

2496
01:28:41,152 --> 01:28:42,220
Congratulations.

2497
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,556
(Haha and So Min remain.)

2498
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:45,690
So Min, choose this one.

2499
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,958
So Min's fate will be sealed...

2500
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:48,359
- if she messes up again. - Please.

2501
01:28:49,394 --> 01:28:52,897
Please let me get what I want.

2502
01:28:53,264 --> 01:28:54,499
You can do this.

2503
01:28:54,966 --> 01:28:56,534
Please let me get what I want.

2504
01:28:57,068 --> 01:29:00,004
I don't care if I remain single. Let me use all my luck right now.

2505
01:29:00,004 --> 01:29:02,640
(Please hear my prayer.)

2506
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,808
- "I don't care if I remain single." - Please.

2507
01:29:03,808 --> 01:29:07,045
That's a bit extreme.

2508
01:29:07,045 --> 01:29:08,813
- 5, 4, - Please let me get it.

2509
01:29:08,846 --> 01:29:11,849
3, 2, 1.

2510
01:29:12,617 --> 01:29:13,885
It's the other one.

2511
01:29:14,652 --> 01:29:16,588
Please open the briefcases at the same time.

2512
01:29:16,588 --> 01:29:19,257
1, 2, 3.

2513
01:29:19,257 --> 01:29:20,258
(Who has the Luxury Package?)

2514
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:22,827
(Luxury Package)

2515
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:27,565
(So Min gets the Luxury Package.)

2516
01:29:29,801 --> 01:29:32,337
You know, you won't get married now.

2517
01:29:32,403 --> 01:29:34,739
You sold your soul.

2518
01:29:34,973 --> 01:29:36,140
My goodness.

2519
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:39,243
(I am happy right now.)

2520
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:40,244
(The 3rd week of Family Package)

2521
01:29:40,244 --> 01:29:43,581
(Luxury Package and Shuddering Package)

2522
01:29:43,881 --> 01:29:45,183
(Next week)

2523
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:47,352
(They take a break from Family Package.)

2524
01:29:47,352 --> 01:29:50,054
(The war for TV rating notice begins once again.)

2525
01:29:50,054 --> 01:29:51,856
(It has become more fierce.)

2526
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,858
(There is only one main character.)

2527
01:29:54,058 --> 01:29:56,861
(Ruthless scenarios)

2528
01:29:57,328 --> 01:29:59,597
(Who is fated to be the victim?)

2529
01:29:59,664 --> 01:30:01,633
(However, do not give hope.)

2530
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,936
(Avengers-like stars are here to help.)

2531
01:30:05,069 --> 01:30:06,738
(They will show remarkable plays.)

2532
01:30:06,804 --> 01:30:08,773
(However,)

2533
01:30:08,773 --> 01:30:11,309
(they are of no exception.)

2534
01:30:11,676 --> 01:30:13,244
(They undergo ridiculous missions...)

2535
01:30:13,244 --> 01:30:15,246
(that kill their brains.)

2536
01:30:15,313 --> 01:30:17,582
(What will be their fate?)

2537
01:30:17,749 --> 01:30:19,751
(You know,)

2538
01:30:19,751 --> 01:30:21,019
(I feel extremely uncomfortable right now.)

2539
01:30:21,386 --> 01:30:23,388
(TV Rating Notice Part 2: Infinity War)
