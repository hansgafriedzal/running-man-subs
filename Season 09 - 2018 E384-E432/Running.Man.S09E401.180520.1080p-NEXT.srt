1
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:09,913
(Recap)

2
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:11,982
(Part 2 of the TV rating notice had finally returned!)

3
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:17,153
(It was time to change the current notice, Jae Seok and the Animals.)

4
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:22,459
(The notice, the poster, and the official photo were at stake.)

5
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:25,161
(The storyboards were more ruthless.)

6
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:30,867
(The disguises would be even more dreadful.)

7
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:36,406
(The race's winner's storyboard will be the TV rating notice.)

8
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:42,012
(The members' scenarios were more varied.)

9
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:46,449
(There was an ingenious scenario, Doppelganger TV Rating Notice.)

10
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,784
(Kwang Soo will be Han Gi Beom.)

11
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:53,023
(Jong Kook will be Pak Se Ri.)

12
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,525
(It's time to choose the scenario for the 2nd TV rating notice.)

13
00:00:55,725 --> 00:01:01,097
(They carried out a mission with the guests.)

14
00:01:01,264 --> 00:01:05,902
(Now, only the final mission remains.)

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,508
(The current score after the 1st mission)

16
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:16,479
(They enter the swimming pool for the last round.)

17
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,215
I am already scared. Is this what we are doing today?

18
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:20,317
We will fall into the water again.

19
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,018
(The final round involves the improved flying chairs.)

20
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:23,320
What should I do? I am so scared.

21
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,022
- You press the button. - Yes, from here.

22
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,724
- Running Man is rated... - Is that Pirate Roulette Game?

23
00:01:27,724 --> 00:01:29,926
(Kwang Soo is surprised.)

24
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:33,797
We will play the Pirate Roulette Game with the flying chairs.

25
00:01:33,863 --> 00:01:35,265
That's unbelievable.

26
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:37,467
All of you are here.

27
00:01:37,567 --> 00:01:39,336
Before we move onto the last round,

28
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:41,571
let me tell you that your seat is very important.

29
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,872
Really?

30
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,943
(Their seats can change the result of the game.)

31
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:50,513
I will give you the last chance to choose your seats.

32
00:01:50,747 --> 00:01:53,483
People who sit next to you are very important.

33
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,085
I won't sit next to Kwang Soo.

34
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:58,755
(No matter what it is, I don't want to sit next to him.)

35
00:01:58,755 --> 00:01:59,956
Hold on.

36
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:02,726
We should avoid Kwang Soo and So Min.

37
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:03,927
We should avoid Jae Seok as well.

38
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,196
(The members become serious because of the flying chairs.)

39
00:02:06,196 --> 00:02:07,364
Choose your seats.

40
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:10,333
Choose by the current ranks. Top one chooses first.

41
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:12,102
- Hurry up and choose. - You didn't tell us the reason.

42
00:02:12,102 --> 00:02:13,503
Let's sit together.

43
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:14,904
- You came second. - All right.

44
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,806
- You should tell us the reason. - Will you sit there?

45
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:17,941
Okay.

46
00:02:17,941 --> 00:02:19,242
Hold on. If you sit next to her...

47
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:21,111
- Ji Hyo, come here. - Do you want to sit next to her?

48
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:22,746
- Hold on. For goodness' sake! - Yes!

49
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:24,614
- Ji Hyo, come here. - Do you want to sit next to her?

50
00:02:24,714 --> 00:02:26,583
(I see that my seat is empty.)

51
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,184
- For goodness' sake! - Yes!

52
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,452
- Go away. - Yes!

53
00:02:29,452 --> 00:02:31,054
- Go away. - We are saved.

54
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:32,255
Go away.

55
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,623
I am going to sit here.

56
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:35,725
- Do you have a problem? - It looks nice.

57
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,694
This side is better.

58
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,062
- It looks nice. - Seriously.

59
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:41,164
This side is better.

60
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:42,465
- What should I do? - It's your turn to choose.

61
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:43,867
- I am so nervous. - Jae Seok.

62
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:45,602
Poop should go to the poop field.

63
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:47,437
(Why are you hesitating?)

64
00:02:47,704 --> 00:02:50,173
(It's clear that the seat is for Jae Seok.)

65
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,975
- Why would you say that? - Must you ask?

66
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,043
(Jae Seok is the last member of the trio.)

67
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,812
- Why would you say that? - Must you ask?

68
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:58,014
- Poop should go to the poop field. - Come here.

69
00:02:58,014 --> 00:03:02,085
- Tiger moths should stay together. - That's right.

70
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:03,486
- Let's go. - All right.

71
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:05,255
Okay. That's good.

72
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,256
(The tiger moth trio is formed.)

73
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:07,624
I ended up sitting next to Jong Kook.

74
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,292
You ended up sitting next to me.

75
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,294
- Se Chan. - Let's go.

76
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,263
The last mission is...

77
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:15,565
The Flying Pirate Quiz.

78
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:18,301
(The Flying Pirate Quiz)

79
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,837
- How does it work? - Each member gets 20 swords...

80
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:24,307
and additional swords that match their scores from the last mission.

81
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:26,242
The member who knows the answer to the question...

82
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:28,945
can bet as many swords as he or she wants.

83
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:32,015
The member who bets the most swords will answer.

84
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,316
You know the rules, right?

85
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:36,553
(If your answer is wrong, you lose the swords and get a penalty.)

86
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:39,055
If someone gets a question right, the members on both sides...

87
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:41,624
get a penalty and lose five swords.

88
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:43,626
(The members on both sides get a penalty and lose 5 swords.)

89
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:46,663
(If the person next to you is good, you get penalties and lose swords.)

90
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:48,164
- That's too much. - For goodness' sake.

91
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:50,033
- My seat is bad. - The smart one gets everything.

92
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,202
- Your seat is good because... - Why?

93
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,436
If she gets a question right...

94
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:57,173
Oh, she can't get any right.

95
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,342
(Ji Hyo is hopeless when it comes to quizzes.)

96
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,344
She does horribly at guessing.

97
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:03,813
(So Min is nervous since Jae Seok is good.)

98
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:06,015
- Don't get it right. - Don't.

99
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,417
There are five questions in total.

100
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,986
The member with the most number of swords...

101
00:04:09,986 --> 00:04:12,155
will win the three components of the TV rating notice.

102
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:13,423
I can do this.

103
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:16,826
(The Flying Pirate Quiz)

104
00:04:16,826 --> 00:04:18,194
Here comes the question.

105
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:19,496
It's the first question.

106
00:04:19,496 --> 00:04:22,432
The word, "bidet",

107
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,502
comes from a French word that means this.

108
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:28,071
- Really? - Choose from the following choices.

109
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,873
Number one, swan.

110
00:04:30,073 --> 00:04:32,075
Number two, pony.

111
00:04:32,175 --> 00:04:34,077
Number three, fountain.

112
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,045
Number four, valley.

113
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:38,581
- I have the answer. - How many swords will you bet?

114
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:40,783
(Swan, pony, fountain, valley)

115
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:42,585
I will bet five swords.

116
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,686
He gets the penalty if he is wrong, right?

117
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,755
I am glad I am not sitting next to Kwang Soo.

118
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:48,491
- I hope the pirate pops up. - I hope it pops up.

119
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,361
(Kwang Soo acts confidently as if he knows the answer.)

120
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,795
- Kwang Soo. - Pop up.

121
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,364
- Pop up. - He wants to get ahead.

122
00:04:54,531 --> 00:04:55,865
Pop up.

123
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,133
(Careful)

124
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,334
Please.

125
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,303
(Please pop up, Pirate.)

126
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:01,804
- Pop up. - Okay.

127
00:05:01,804 --> 00:05:03,873
(He succeeds in betting 3 swords.)

128
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:05,475
No way.

129
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,876
(They don't believe that Kwang Soo will succeed.)

130
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,411
- Come on out. - Please.

131
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,213
Okay!

132
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:13,216
(Only one remains.)

133
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:15,985
Your luck improved a lot.

134
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:19,022
(Inserting one more sword earns him the chance to answer the question.)

135
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,591
(Kwang Soo fails.)

136
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:23,593
- That was incredible. - What is this?

137
00:05:24,861 --> 00:05:27,363
(Kwang Soo is the same.)

138
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,365
- I am so thankful. - That's amazing.

139
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:32,035
- My goodness. - I thought he might succeed.

140
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:34,537
When he sits down, we will launch him and move on.

141
00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:37,073
He wants Kwang Soo to hurry up and sit down.

142
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,175
(He wants Kwang Soo to hurry up and sit down.)

143
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:40,743
I am scared. I am going to step aside.

144
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:41,844
I really don't want...

145
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:45,014
I really don't want to fall into the pool.

146
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:47,083
(Kwang Soo loses 5 swords and gets the flying chair penalty.)

147
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,153
- My goodness. - I can't bear to watch it.

148
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,255
(Even I am nervous.)

149
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,024
Here we go. 1, 2, 3.

150
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,294
(Even to Kwang Soo, the flying chair is nerve-wracking.)

151
00:05:58,294 --> 00:05:59,996
(Flying)

152
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:02,932
(Tiger moth number 1 is launched.)

153
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,604
(High trajectory, long duration of flight,)

154
00:06:07,604 --> 00:06:11,240
(and exceptional ugliness)

155
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,345
(It's a textbook example of the flying chair penalty.)

156
00:06:16,245 --> 00:06:18,915
- It became stronger. - He doesn't look okay.

157
00:06:18,915 --> 00:06:20,483
(He finishes testing the penalty.)

158
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,485
- It's a bit scary. - I know.

159
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,287
(The members become more nervous.)

160
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,755
- My goodness. - It's scary.

161
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:27,123
I can't help but focus.

162
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,125
- What are you doing, Ji Hyo? - Why are you fixing your clothes?

163
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,194
It might come off if I receive the penalty.

164
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:33,463
- I am nervous. - What is she doing?

165
00:06:34,564 --> 00:06:38,501
(At that moment, So Min bets 5 swords.)

166
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,736
Five swords.

167
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,571
So Min will bet five swords.

168
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,106
Seeing Kwang Soo fly into the air made me less nervous.

169
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,507
(You should try it yourself.)

170
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,875
It's understandable that Kwang Soo is angry.

171
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,343
Still, it's scary.

172
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,845
It has been a while since I felt so angry.

173
00:06:48,845 --> 00:06:50,246
- I am so annoyed. - My goodness.

174
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:52,882
- Do you know the answer? - We might fly into the air.

175
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:54,684
I think it's number one.

176
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:56,853
Is it because of the swan mark on the toilet?

177
00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,255
- It's a trademark. - It's...

178
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,724
- It's for sinks. - Listen.

179
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,794
The bidet is white and shaped like this.

180
00:07:04,794 --> 00:07:06,996
The round part looks like...

181
00:07:06,996 --> 00:07:08,665
a swan's wings.

182
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:10,633
- I had the same thought. - That's why I chose number one.

183
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:12,035
Also, the word is French.

184
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,736
- It could be related to ballet. - Swan.

185
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:15,304
- Swan. - Are you thinking "Swan Lake"?

186
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:17,974
Will it be number one?

187
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:20,743
I have never been so scared.

188
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,846
I know for certain that the answer is "fountain".

189
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:28,584
(Screaming)

190
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:32,955
(The pirate pops out at the last sword.)

191
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,691
That was incredible.

192
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,693
- What should I do? - She doesn't disappoint.

193
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:39,195
1, 2, 3.

194
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:41,964
(Tiger moth number 2 is launched.)

195
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,501
(It looks like she is dancing.)

196
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,671
It doesn't look any weaker.

197
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,972
10 swords!

198
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,176
(10 swords!)

199
00:07:53,176 --> 00:07:54,544
20 swords!

200
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:56,345
30 swords! I'll kill you all.

201
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:58,214
(As soon as she comes out of the water)

202
00:07:58,214 --> 00:07:59,415
Are you serious?

203
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:01,784
I guess she gained confidence after the penalty.

204
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:02,985
Let's go.

205
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:05,455
(She tries the Pirate Roulette Game again.)

206
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:08,024
I have never felt so scared of the Pirate Roulette Game.

207
00:08:08,725 --> 00:08:09,892
Stab him with swords.

208
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:11,260
(The game and the flying chair create synergy.)

209
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,163
- You have one more sword to go. - Bye.

210
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,733
(So Min successfully bets 5 swords.)

211
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,234
I don't know the answer.

212
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:20,636
I am sure the tiger moths will bet more swords.

213
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:22,305
(I am sure the tiger moths will bet more swords.)

214
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:24,774
- Let's see. - I will bet six swords.

215
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:29,245
(Kwang Soo decides to bet 6 swords.)

216
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:31,914
Kwang Soo got the hang of it.

217
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:33,983
Sit down, So Min.

218
00:08:34,784 --> 00:08:36,085
(Peek-a-boo)

219
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:40,423
(He is the unluckiest tiger moth.)

220
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:41,991
What was that?

221
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,861
- My goodness. - What is wrong with you today?

222
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:47,396
Because of you, people think Running Man is scripted.

223
00:08:49,132 --> 00:08:51,334
- How did this happen? - I am sick and tired of this.

224
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:52,335
(He has been the unluckiest of all time.)

225
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:57,707
(He gets launched with a resigned expression.)

226
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,676
(He loses 6 swords without having a chance to answer.)

227
00:09:00,676 --> 00:09:02,945
If So Min gets it right, people on her sides will get thrown.

228
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:04,013
(So Min gets a chance to answer the question.)

229
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:06,215
- It's not swan. - It's not swan?

230
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:08,284
- It's not swan. - Answer the question.

231
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:09,886
So Min, what's your answer?

232
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,354
We get another chance if she gets it wrong, right?

233
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,822
We will need a bidet.

234
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:16,192
I don't want to fly into the air.

235
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,761
- What's your answer? - Number one, swan.

236
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:20,296
(She sticks to her answer.)

237
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,265
Number one, swan.

238
00:09:22,265 --> 00:09:24,634
- It must be correct. - Sit down, So Min.

239
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:28,171
(If So Min's answer is correct,)

240
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,874
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo lose 5 swords and get the penalty.)

241
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:33,442
Okay!

242
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:35,144
(Number 1, swan is incorrect.)

243
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:36,312
- She needs to get launched, right? - So Min.

244
00:09:36,312 --> 00:09:38,581
(Number 1, swan, is incorrect.)

245
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:41,651
- You fool, it can't be swan. - Yes!

246
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:44,754
That makes no sense. How could it be a swan?

247
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,657
What was that? She went in well.

248
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:50,793
(She goes into the water in a stable way.)

249
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:53,496
- So Min is good at this now. - So Min, you did a good job.

250
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:57,133
Number one, pony.

251
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,135
- That's number 2. - That's number 2.

252
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,336
(That's number 2.)

253
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:01,571
My goodness.

254
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:03,406
It has to be pony.

255
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:04,774
(Haha gets involved with the war of bidet.)

256
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,445
(The pirate gives him the flying chair penalty.)

257
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:11,113
(Flying)

258
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:13,816
(Popping)

259
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:15,084
Thank goodness.

260
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:17,887
- Did you rig the game? - Thank goodness.

261
00:10:17,954 --> 00:10:19,255
(Bye, kid.)

262
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:20,523
He went in well.

263
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,392
(The pirate's curse makes everyone suffer the penalty.)

264
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:25,394
I will bet 5 swords. 1.

265
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:29,632
(Seok Jin successfully bets 6 swords.)

266
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,033
I will stick in all the swords.

267
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,602
- Here comes Ji Hyo. - Here comes Ji Hyo.

268
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:33,836
Let's go!

269
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,006
What's wrong with you, Ji Hyo?

270
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,241
(Even Ji Hyo gets it.)

271
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:39,742
(The curse of Pirate Roulette Game)

272
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:41,110
- What's wrong with Ji Hyo? - It's her.

273
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,411
It's not Haha.

274
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:45,481
(Even lucky Ji Hyo is thrown.)

275
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,083
She went in.

276
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,584
- Are you okay? - What do you think it is?

277
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:49,585
(Seok Jin gets a chance to answer.)

278
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,554
What do you think it is? Is it pony?

279
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:52,755
You'll answer wrong.

280
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:54,423
I think it's pony.

281
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:56,926
- Napoleon rode horses. - Right.

282
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,661
French people like horses.

283
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,162
- Why... - Is it me if you're correct?

284
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:01,864
- It's you if I answer correctly. - No.

285
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:03,766
- You're telling me nonsense. - Fountain is the answer.

286
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:06,636
(He hopes that Seok Jin answers incorrectly.)

287
00:11:06,636 --> 00:11:07,703
I know the answer.

288
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,072
(What's his answer?)

289
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:11,173
Pony.

290
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,174
(His answer is pony.)

291
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:14,277
- I hope he's wrong. - Is the answer pony?

292
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:17,046
(If it's correct, Haha and Ji Hyo are penalized.)

293
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,915
- I thought it was fountain. - He answered pony.

294
00:11:18,915 --> 00:11:20,683
Let it be fountain.

295
00:11:20,683 --> 00:11:24,153
(Is the answer number 2, pony?)

296
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,554
The answer is fountain.

297
00:11:26,622 --> 00:11:29,191
(Pony is correct.)

298
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:31,460
- I told you. - Was it pony?

299
00:11:31,794 --> 00:11:33,696
Everyone, please applaud.

300
00:11:33,963 --> 00:11:35,765
Give him a round of applause.

301
00:11:35,765 --> 00:11:37,934
(Bidet refers to a pet pony in French.)

302
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:43,306
(Haha and Ji Hyo lose 5 swords, and they're penalized.)

303
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:44,840
Both of them were thrown off.

304
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,975
(Seok Jin wins 6 swords.)

305
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,743
The makeup show is coming up soon.

306
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,445
(Seok Jin wins 6 swords.)

307
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:52,515
Here's the last question.

308
00:11:53,783 --> 00:11:55,584
- Do you know the current score? - Yes.

309
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,286
- Jae Seok is running first place. - It's Jae Seok.

310
00:11:57,286 --> 00:12:00,056
Jae Seok is most likely to win.

311
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:01,223
(Jae Seok's "The Greatest Showman")

312
00:12:01,223 --> 00:12:02,325
- Is it Jae Seok? - It's his TV rating notice.

313
00:12:02,325 --> 00:12:04,293
It could be "The Greatest Showman".

314
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:06,295
We must stop him.

315
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:07,863
I'll be a giant joker.

316
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:10,032
(We must stop him. I'll be a giant joker.)

317
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,535
- It can't be his. - I should win.

318
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:15,705
"The Greatest Showman" doesn't fit.

319
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:17,473
I have to hang upside down.

320
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,376
- Who wants to be a giant? - We must do it. We have time.

321
00:12:20,376 --> 00:12:22,345
I keep thinking of ideas.

322
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:23,512
(Here's the last question.)

323
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:25,715
Here's the question.

324
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,483
In Greek and Roman mythology,

325
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:30,987
what did the sphinx do...

326
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:34,824
when Oedipus answered the riddle correctly?

327
00:12:34,824 --> 00:12:37,126
Number one, it turned into a rock.

328
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:39,395
Number two, it turned into dust.

329
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:41,430
Number three, it turned into an animal.

330
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,033
Number four, it jumped off of a cliff.

331
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,601
I bet five swords.

332
00:12:46,035 --> 00:12:47,203
Five?

333
00:12:47,203 --> 00:12:48,704
I'll go.

334
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,306
- Will you bet five? - Yes.

335
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:52,375
Please pop.

336
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,876
(He tries to jinx her.)

337
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:56,812
- Come on, Se Chan. - I'm sorry. I'll stop.

338
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,414
Empty your mind, So Min.

339
00:12:58,414 --> 00:13:00,483
You've been in the water many times, so relax.

340
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,650
- I want to win. - Otherwise, you'll lose.

341
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,586
- Just stick the swords. - If you take time, you'll lose.

342
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:04,920
(The pirate pops.)

343
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,822
Come on, So Min.

344
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:10,593
(She really loses.)

345
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:12,061
I told you to be ready.

346
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,563
It popped at the third try. It startled me.

347
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:16,265
It's because you're sitting next to Kwang Soo.

348
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,266
(She gets penalized again.)

349
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,703
So Min, if you give them to me,

350
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:22,505
- I'll get penalized instead. - I have to win.

351
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:24,774
(Do we have a deal?)

352
00:13:24,774 --> 00:13:27,043
- To you? - Give me 10 swords.

353
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:29,245
I'll go in the water if you give me nine.

354
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:30,713
I'll go in if you give me three.

355
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,481
- I accept 3. - 3?

356
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:33,482
(She accepts his offer.)

357
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,651
- Three. - Seriously?

358
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:38,554
Wait! I'll accept two.

359
00:13:38,554 --> 00:13:40,222
- How about one? - Okay.

360
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,691
(Kwang Soo offers to take just one.)

361
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,361
(He feels like a loser.)

362
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,196
- Gosh. - One?

363
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,165
Is this how Kwang Soo will play?

364
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:50,366
(Currently, Kwang Soo has no swords.)

365
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,970
(He goes into the water instead.)

366
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:58,274
He can't control his body.

367
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,443
Kwang Soo is good at flying.

368
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:03,245
- It's strange. - So Min.

369
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,814
- Pardon? - Thank you.

370
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:06,215
- I only have two left. - Kwang Soo.

371
00:14:06,215 --> 00:14:07,883
- You should bet one. - Okay.

372
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:11,754
If the pirate pops,

373
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:13,956
- What if it pops after one sword? - he deserves the Grand Prize.

374
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,292
I'd be really impressed.

375
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:17,493
(If the pirate pops, he deserves the Grand Prize.)

376
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,295
I'm getting teary-eyed.

377
00:14:20,596 --> 00:14:22,531
- He looks so ugly. - Where are you looking?

378
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,333
He looks so ugly.

379
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,504
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

380
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:29,772
I got it.

381
00:14:29,772 --> 00:14:32,241
- Let's start betting. - Wait.

382
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,943
What are you saying?

383
00:14:34,243 --> 00:14:37,113
(Let's start to bet.)

384
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:39,215
- Why? - We should make bets.

385
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:40,516
- We should make bets. - Will you bet five?

386
00:14:40,516 --> 00:14:41,784
Those next to him should bet.

387
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:45,221
- No way. I can't believe this. - What's going on?

388
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,822
I'll bet two.

389
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,691
(Se Chan bets 2.)

390
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:50,693
I bet two.

391
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:51,994
(He's safe.)

392
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,663
I'll bet three.

393
00:14:54,663 --> 00:14:55,965
(He makes a bet of 3.)

394
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:58,434
Is it over for me after this round?

395
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:00,035
(Is it over for me?)

396
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:02,204
It's over once two people are ahead of me.

397
00:15:02,204 --> 00:15:03,606
It's over.

398
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:06,342
I'll bet three.

399
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:08,944
(Haha is the third to play.)

400
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:10,713
That's amazing. He's bold.

401
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:12,615
(He becomes bold.)

402
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,983
(Haha makes a bet of 3.)

403
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,585
Is anyone betting more? It'll have to be four swords.

404
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,154
- You must bet four. - What about me?

405
00:15:18,154 --> 00:15:19,255
We need two more.

406
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,323
- How about a bet of 4? - Will anyone bet 4?

407
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:23,192
Is there anyone? I'll bet two more.

408
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:25,794
- Can you take back your swords? - Don't be scared.

409
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,563
- Please pop. - Don't be scared.

410
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,131
I bet two more.

411
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:32,935
Please pop.

412
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,904
This is the last round.

413
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:37,373
- It went in safely. - Is this the last question?

414
00:15:37,373 --> 00:15:38,474
(The competition gets fierce.)

415
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,742
Let's continue.

416
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,443
How many does the next person have to bet?

417
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,045
You must bet six swords.

418
00:15:43,045 --> 00:15:44,046
- Six? - Make a bet.

419
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:45,681
I don't think he'll answer correctly.

420
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:48,484
After he's thrown in the water...

421
00:15:48,484 --> 00:15:50,186
Can we try again after that?

422
00:15:50,186 --> 00:15:52,021
Yes, that's what I'm waiting for.

423
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:53,756
- That's what I'm waiting for. - I'll do that too.

424
00:15:53,756 --> 00:15:57,126
- I see. - You and I'll lose anyway.

425
00:15:57,293 --> 00:15:59,094
- We'll lose anyway. - Anyway,

426
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:00,896
after those two get thrown in,

427
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,665
- I'll take my chances. - Let's do this.

428
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,366
- Let's bless each other. - Of course.

429
00:16:04,366 --> 00:16:05,734
What's your answer?

430
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,770
- Mine is number 3. - Then I'll answer number 4.

431
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,205
Okay.

432
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,373
- Okay? Nevis. - Okay. Swing.

433
00:16:11,874 --> 00:16:14,743
(The silly brothers return to the game.)

434
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,145
Okay, it's done.

435
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:18,013
(Se Chan makes additional bets.)

436
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,415
- It's done. - Go first.

437
00:16:19,415 --> 00:16:21,684
(Go first.)

438
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,153
- Go and answer the question first. - Me?

439
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,454
- Okay. - Make more bets.

440
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:27,156
- I won't. - Why not?

441
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,824
You answer it.

442
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:30,226
Can't he make more bets?

443
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:31,894
- He doesn't have to. - I won't.

444
00:16:31,894 --> 00:16:33,963
Haha also thinks that you'll answer incorrectly.

445
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:36,532
(Haha also thinks that you'll answer incorrectly.)

446
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:38,100
Other people can bet.

447
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,702
It's the last question.

448
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,303
- Se Chan won't be right. - It's too difficult.

449
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:43,205
The answer is number three.

450
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:46,342
(Se Chan's answer is number 3.)

451
00:16:46,342 --> 00:16:48,644
Number 3, she turns into an animal.

452
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,746
- I think it's wrong. - Okay!

453
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,715
(Number 3 is wrong.)

454
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,116
Have a seat.

455
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,884
- Is it my turn next? - Go.

456
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:57,853
- I thought it was correct. - Okay!

457
00:16:57,853 --> 00:17:00,222
- It's the last question. - I'm definitely correct.

458
00:17:00,823 --> 00:17:02,191
Number four.

459
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:07,796
(If Haha is correct, he places first instead of Jae Seok.)

460
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,202
(If Haha is wrong, Jae Seok wins.)

461
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:16,005
Number four, it jumped off of a cliff.

462
00:17:16,005 --> 00:17:18,073
(Will Haha answer and become the winner?)

463
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:19,675
All right!

464
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,411
(Haha answers correctly.)

465
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:24,313
- Is it correct? - How did you know?

466
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,381
(Haha wins the race.)

467
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,883
- How did you know? - How did you know the answer?

468
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:29,285
So now,

469
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:32,621
Haha gets additional 5 on top of his 26 swords.

470
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:34,223
He wins with a total of 31 swords.

471
00:17:35,024 --> 00:17:36,425
- Haha, remember me. - Okay.

472
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:38,494
- Good job. Nevis. - I helped you. Swing!

473
00:17:38,494 --> 00:17:40,462
I've never seen Han Gi Beom in person.

474
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:43,065
Doppelganger TV Rating Notice.

475
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,733
Hey.

476
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,536
I'll be the main person.

477
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,775
Hello, hello.

478
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,345
This wasn't necessary. Goodness.

479
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,314
I don't like the setup.

480
00:17:58,314 --> 00:17:59,415
(It's a fancy banner for Haha.)

481
00:17:59,415 --> 00:18:01,483
- Goodness. - What's that?

482
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:03,052
- What's that? - It's strange.

483
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:04,753
- Haha. - Welcome.

484
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,522
- Hello. - What's with your outfit?

485
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:08,324
- Welcome. - What's going on?

486
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:10,225
Haha has a script.

487
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,895
- Are you at the center? - Are you hosting the show today?

488
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,964
- Are you hosting the show today? - Yes, I am.

489
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:17,433
- He's the main person. - Stand around the center.

490
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:20,202
Haha is at the center.

491
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:24,473
Let's start. Are the cameras rolling?

492
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:27,142
- Where's the clapperboard? - What do you mean by that?

493
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:29,611
- Where's the clapperboard? - He looks amazing.

494
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,214
- Are the cameras on? - Is the sound okay?

495
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:35,050
- Audience, please get ready. - Where's the audience?

496
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,752
Please give us a round of applause.

497
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,253
(The audience claps.)

498
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:40,055
Here we go. Members.

499
00:18:40,055 --> 00:18:41,523
Talk about what's going on these days.

500
00:18:41,523 --> 00:18:44,393
(Talk about what's going on these days.)

501
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,795
- That's so unnatural. - It should be natural.

502
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:48,630
- What's this? - Jae Seok does it naturally.

503
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,065
- How did he do it? - This is frustrating.

504
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,934
- What do you mean? - Fix their outfits, please.

505
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:53,736
Fix their outfits, please.

506
00:18:53,736 --> 00:18:55,170
- How about yours? - Let's go.

507
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,606
(He's so unnatural.)

508
00:18:57,606 --> 00:18:59,575
- What's this? - What's going on?

509
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:00,943
Jae Seok, you run the show.

510
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:03,345
- This is the worst opening ever. - This is how it is.

511
00:19:03,345 --> 00:19:05,514
- I have my own style. - It's horrible.

512
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:06,815
(Will things be okay today?)

513
00:19:06,815 --> 00:19:08,684
What are we doing today?

514
00:19:08,684 --> 00:19:10,386
Before we start the show,

515
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:14,123
- I'll introduce a beautiful host. - Really?

516
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:16,225
(I'll introduce a beautiful host who will join me today.)

517
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:18,594
- Today... - There were beautiful ones before.

518
00:19:18,594 --> 00:19:19,995
That's right.

519
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:22,030
- She has quite a lot of experience. - Really?

520
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,500
Yes. She looks great in dresses.

521
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,435
(She looks great in dresses.)

522
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:27,970
- "In dresses"? - Her smiling face...

523
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,605
(Does he mean...)

524
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:32,040
Her smiling face is very lovely.

525
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,075
No way.

526
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,843
(Laughing)

527
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,044
That can't be.

528
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,880
I saw her not long ago.

529
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,915
I saw someone going up the stairs. Is it her?

530
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,450
- Did you see her clearly? - Yes.

531
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,352
She's full of positive energy.

532
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:45,254
She's cheerful.

533
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,923
She's the most beautiful woman. Here's today's host.

534
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:49,691
- "The most beautiful woman"? - "The most beautiful woman"?

535
00:19:50,225 --> 00:19:51,693
Please come out!

536
00:19:51,794 --> 00:19:56,665
(Who is the most beautiful host in the world?)

537
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,436
(Haha's mother, Ok Jeong, is here.)

538
00:20:00,436 --> 00:20:03,672
- It's her. - I'm her fan.

539
00:20:04,273 --> 00:20:09,144
(She wants to be known for a successful show.)

540
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:13,215
(Ok Jeong's entertaining skills are limitless.)

541
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:18,520
(His mother is adorable.)

542
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,255
My goodness.

543
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:25,194
(Her embarrassed son can't make eye contact.)

544
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,763
Hello, ma'am.

545
00:20:27,763 --> 00:20:29,965
- How have you been? - I saw you a minute ago.

546
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:32,134
- Hello, Kwang Soo. - Hello.

547
00:20:32,134 --> 00:20:34,703
- Hello. - Hello, Seok Jin.

548
00:20:34,703 --> 00:20:37,005
Let's greet later.

549
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,373
- Okay. - Oh, my.

550
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:40,676
- It's been a while. - "Let's greet later."

551
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,911
But we just greeted.

552
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:44,713
- We just greeted. - Seok Jin.

553
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,515
Ok Jeong said to Seok Jin,

554
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:47,783
"Let's greet later."

555
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:49,051
It seems like...

556
00:20:49,051 --> 00:20:51,920
Ok Jeong feels a bit uncomfortable around you.

557
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,255
- Why? - I don't.

558
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,290
- No problem. - Seok Jin is a bit old.

559
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,993
Are we around the same age?

560
00:20:57,993 --> 00:20:59,394
No.

561
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:00,395
(They're 20 years apart, but they have the same passion.)

562
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:01,663
- We're not. - She went too far.

563
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:04,733
- Nice to see you. - You're today's host.

564
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,902
(The mother and son will host the rating notice episode.)

565
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:09,204
- That's right. - Let's give her a big hand.

566
00:21:09,204 --> 00:21:11,473
- Look at that. - There are even microphones.

567
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:12,774
"MC Haha".

568
00:21:12,774 --> 00:21:14,076
(Special hosts need special microphones.)

569
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:16,144
It's like on a music show.

570
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,413
- Oh, my. - They look like music show hosts.

571
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:19,882
I'm so honored.

572
00:21:20,716 --> 00:21:23,185
You're today's host.

573
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:24,920
Please introduce yourself.

574
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,824
Hello. I'm your beautiful host,

575
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:31,960
Kim Ok Jeong. Nice to see you all.

576
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,562
I wish you the best of luck.

577
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:40,302
By the way, Ok Jeong...

578
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,404
- enjoys being on TV very much. - She loves it.

579
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,906
She does.

580
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,874
I'm an ambitious woman.

581
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:48,510
I'm an ambitious woman.

582
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,915
(Haha's mom is ambitious.)

583
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,983
- Oh, my. - She's so jealous...

584
00:21:54,983 --> 00:21:56,385
of the moms on "Mom's Diary".

585
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:58,720
"I should be one of them."

586
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,156
- "I should be right there." - That's right.

587
00:22:01,723 --> 00:22:04,393
Anyone could tell right away that...

588
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:06,695
- you two are family. - Exactly.

589
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:10,232
- They look alike, right? - They really do.

590
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,501
Haha takes after me which is a good thing.

591
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,503
That's why he's so funny.

592
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:17,205
Is your husband...

593
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,874
Is your husband not as funny?

594
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:19,875
Not quite.

595
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,411
(He is not quite as funny.)

596
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:24,813
(I should be credited for Haha's wit.)

597
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:26,615
She's so good.

598
00:22:26,615 --> 00:22:29,251
Today on Haha's Running Man...

599
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:31,420
for Doppelganger TV Rating Notice Special,

600
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,723
I invited the members' doppelgangers myself.

601
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,224
(Haha invited the members' doppelgangers.)

602
00:22:36,425 --> 00:22:39,494
First, let's welcome Seok Jin's doppelganger.

603
00:22:39,494 --> 00:22:41,530
- I think I know. - It must be Jo Woo Jong.

604
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,533
They look like brothers.

605
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:47,135
- They look so much alike. - I think I know.

606
00:22:47,135 --> 00:22:49,504
Seok Jin's doppelganger.

607
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:50,772
Come on out!

608
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:52,374
It must be Woo Jong.

609
00:22:52,374 --> 00:22:54,343
(Is it really Jo Woo Jong?)

610
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,713
(Seok Jin's clone is here.)

611
00:22:58,914 --> 00:23:00,115
(They look alike from head to toe.)

612
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:03,752
(Seok Jin's twin brother, Jo Woo Jong)

613
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,320
(Amazed)

614
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,322
- He's even wearing the same shirt. - What is this?

615
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,590
They look exactly the same.

616
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,492
- Even the shirts are. - What is this?

617
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:11,693
(It's hard to tell them apart.)

618
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:13,996
- Nice to see you. - Hello.

619
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:15,764
- Woo Jong. - Woo Jong.

620
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,533
- Just the glasses... - Our glasses are different.

621
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,103
(Seok Jin's doppelganger, Jo Woo Jong)

622
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:22,804
- Hello. - Gosh.

623
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,773
I'm the young Jee Seok Jin, Jo Woo Jong.

624
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:27,142
- Hello. - Oh, my.

625
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,244
Even your noses look the same.

626
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:31,113
- This is incredible. - You're the same.

627
00:23:31,113 --> 00:23:34,016
- They look so much alike. - Just the glasses look different.

628
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,685
- Do we look alike? - One of them is supposed to die.

629
00:23:36,685 --> 00:23:38,453
(Are they real doppelgangers?)

630
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:41,323
- Well... - One of them should die.

631
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,925
- If doppelgangers meet... - Our glasses look different.

632
00:23:45,193 --> 00:23:47,062
Our next guest is...

633
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:49,064
- Is that it? - Jae Seok's doppelganger.

634
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:50,265
Me?

635
00:23:50,365 --> 00:23:52,901
There are many people who look like him.

636
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:55,604
- Including Bum Kyun... - There are many.

637
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:58,173
- Right? - Jae Seok's doppelganger,

638
00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,341
please come out!

639
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:02,944
(Jae Seok's doppelganger, please come out!)

640
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:06,081
Seo Ji Suk!

641
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:07,883
Ji Suk.

642
00:24:07,883 --> 00:24:08,884
(They look alike when they smile.)

643
00:24:08,884 --> 00:24:11,520
There is a subtle resemblance.

644
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,422
Ji Suk looks a lot like me.

645
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:15,390
- He looks a lot better. - No.

646
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,993
- This doesn't count. - He looks like me.

647
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:20,996
Ji Suk looks a lot better.

648
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:23,365
Try Jae Seok's glasses on.

649
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:25,233
- These are prescription glasses. - Just for a moment.

650
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:27,035
I look pretty good without glasses.

651
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,203
1, 2, 3.

652
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:32,074
(Can the glasses turn the handsome actor into Jae Seok?)

653
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:33,975
They look alike.

654
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:37,012
(He's turned into a grasshopper.)

655
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,514
- They look alike. - Jae Seok!

656
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:41,450
- They do look alike. - Yes.

657
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,385
You look like me.

658
00:24:43,385 --> 00:24:44,920
- They look alike. - They do.

659
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,222
- They do. - Jae Seok!

660
00:24:47,422 --> 00:24:48,890
What is this?

661
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,892
- It gave me goosebumps. - You look like me.

662
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:51,893
What is this?

663
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:54,196
That's how Jae Seok looks in his best condition.

664
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,865
Ji Suk's face is...

665
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:59,901
- the patted-down version of mine. - It's patted down.

666
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,770
That's why he looks better.

667
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,439
If you hit Ji Suk on the back of the head, he becomes Jae Seok.

668
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,875
(If you hit Ji Suk on the back of the head, he becomes Jae Seok.)

669
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,643
- What? - That's right.

670
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:11,413
- If his mouth pops out... - If his mouth pops out...

671
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:14,683
Jae Seok must have been hit on the back of the head.

672
00:25:14,683 --> 00:25:17,352
You guys are mean.

673
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:19,221
Our next guest is...

674
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,423
- Jong Kook's doppelganger. - Me?

675
00:25:22,224 --> 00:25:23,892
Is Pak Se Ri here?

676
00:25:23,892 --> 00:25:25,393
- I'm curious. - Me too.

677
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:26,394
(Curious and excited)

678
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,864
No. I don't think so.

679
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:31,233
From the small eyes and the broad shoulders to the voice...

680
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,901
- You guys are like twins. - Really?

681
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:36,705
Jong Kook's doppelganger, please come out!

682
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:39,875
(Jong Kook's doppelganger, please come out!)

683
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,545
(K.Will)

684
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:44,780
K.Will.

685
00:25:45,313 --> 00:25:46,515
(They look alike!)

686
00:25:46,515 --> 00:25:47,783
K.Will.

687
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:49,985
Doesn't he look more like Dae Sung?

688
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:52,821
He looks more like Dae Sung.

689
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,824
You know what? Dae Sung,

690
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,094
K.Will, and Jong Kook all look the same.

691
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,264
(Jong Kook's doppelganger, K.Will)

692
00:26:03,165 --> 00:26:06,701
It never occurred to me, but you do look alike.

693
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:08,403
- There is a resemblance. - Yes.

694
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:09,805
I look better.

695
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:12,774
That's just what you think.

696
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:15,510
(They even have similar characters.)

697
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,613
- He's very straightforward. - You're dressed in all black.

698
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,383
(You're dressed in all black.)

699
00:26:21,383 --> 00:26:24,085
I wanted to match Jong Kook's outfit. This is my first appearance.

700
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,854
- Really? - Yes.

701
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:28,490
- We should be nice to him. - I wanted to be on this show,

702
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,394
but this is not how I imagined it to be.

703
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:34,563
(As Jong Kook's doppelganger?)

704
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:36,264
Dae Sung is supposed to be here,

705
00:26:36,264 --> 00:26:37,899
- but he's in the military. - You're his substitute.

706
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:39,534
- I know. - He knows.

707
00:26:39,534 --> 00:26:41,503
But I don't want to do this.

708
00:26:41,503 --> 00:26:43,004
This is so fun.

709
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:46,474
- K.Will was my ideal man in 2013. - There is a resemblance.

710
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,243
(K.Will was So Min's ideal guy back in 2013.)

711
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,744
Gosh.

712
00:26:49,744 --> 00:26:51,680
- I can't believe So Min. - Why?

713
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,549
- Again? - K.Will was her ideal guy in 2013.

714
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,785
- That's right. - Stop it.

715
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,520
- I know. - Back in 2013.

716
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,822
She was my fan for a long time.

717
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:02,290
- Really? - Yes.

718
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,593
She even asked for my autograph in the waiting room.

719
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,261
You remember that?

720
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:07,662
I didn't have many fans.

721
00:27:08,363 --> 00:27:10,131
(Back in 2013, K.Will didn't have many fans.)

722
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:12,901
But So Min is so popular these days.

723
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:14,135
- I know, right? - Then she moved onto...

724
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,503
Gong Yoo right away.

725
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,273
Now, it's Jung Hae In.

726
00:27:18,273 --> 00:27:19,274
She's changed.

727
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:21,843
K.Will, it's so obvious that you're trying to look like Kang Daniel.

728
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:25,313
It's usually not that obvious.

729
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,915
- Hey... - It's just so obvious.

730
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,683
- Stop it. - He looks like Daniel.

731
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:31,853
- Stop it. - Can I borrow your glasses?

732
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:34,256
- Try these on. - Will he look like someone?

733
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:36,791
- Why? - Daniel wears glasses like these.

734
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:38,693
(Daniel sometimes wears glasses like these.)

735
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:40,395
No, right?

736
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:41,963
(Amazed)

737
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:42,964
K.Will.

738
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:45,734
(Oh, it's K.Will.)

739
00:27:45,734 --> 00:27:46,935
(You just look like yourself.)

740
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:50,005
- I mean... - That was honest.

741
00:27:50,005 --> 00:27:53,475
And these glasses are a bit too small for K.Will.

742
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,043
They got stuck.

743
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,646
- The legs were pulled apart. - They left red marks on your face.

744
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:01,082
He's covering his face with his hair.

745
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:05,420
Our next guest is Ji Hyo's doppelganger.

746
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,155
- I think I know. - It's so easy.

747
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:09,991
- We know. - No one else looks more like her.

748
00:28:10,225 --> 00:28:13,395
He'd look exactly like Ji Hyo with a wig on.

749
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:16,264
- Absolutely. - He's the male Song Ji Hyo.

750
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:18,233
- Come on out! - Come on out!

751
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:22,804
(I'm Ji Hyo's little brother, Seong Moon.)

752
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:24,673
(The actor looks just like his sister.)

753
00:28:24,673 --> 00:28:26,474
You should hit your sister.

754
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:28,610
(They both have mischievous personalities.)

755
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,645
It looked like you were kicking a soccer ball.

756
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,514
They look exactly the same.

757
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:34,282
They look alike.

758
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:36,051
- They look exactly alike. - They're twins.

759
00:28:36,051 --> 00:28:37,552
(The sister is shy.)

760
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:38,553
Hello.

761
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,956
They both have big foreheads.

762
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:43,224
They look the same when they smile.

763
00:28:43,224 --> 00:28:44,793
Try smiling. You look exactly alike.

764
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:47,495
(Ji Hyo's doppelganger, Cheon Seong Moon)

765
00:28:47,862 --> 00:28:49,064
Our next guest is...

766
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:50,465
- Se Chan's doppelganger. - Mine?

767
00:28:50,465 --> 00:28:52,734
There are not many people who look like me.

768
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:55,804
Se Chan looks like Kim Kap Soo.

769
00:28:55,804 --> 00:28:58,673
It'd be hilarious if Han Mu is here.

770
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:01,609
- Don't be surprised. - Kim Kap Soo.

771
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,511
- It's an actor. - Really?

772
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:05,180
Is Kap Soo here?

773
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,315
- Is he here? - It is indeed an actor.

774
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:08,583
Who is it?

775
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,685
(What?)

776
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,520
No way.

777
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:16,825
(Everyone is surprised by Se Chan's doppelganger.)

778
00:29:17,726 --> 00:29:18,760
- Jong Hyuk? - Jong Hyuk?

779
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,695
(Lee Jong Hyuk?)

780
00:29:20,895 --> 00:29:23,064
Jong Hyuk doesn't look like Se Chan.

781
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:24,599
This doesn't make sense.

782
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:26,201
He doesn't look like me.

783
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:28,603
Jong Hyuk, you don't look like Se Chan.

784
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:29,804
(Even Se Chan is not convinced.)

785
00:29:30,205 --> 00:29:33,274
(Se Chan's supposed doppelganger, Lee Jong Hyuk)

786
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:35,143
- What happened? - Let me explain.

787
00:29:35,143 --> 00:29:38,313
I was discussing with Haha.

788
00:29:38,313 --> 00:29:42,484
No one wanted to appear as Se Chan's doppelganger.

789
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:44,486
What about Jong Hyuk?

790
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:46,821
- He looks angry. - I just had some free time.

791
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,591
(Nonchalant)

792
00:29:49,591 --> 00:29:51,993
(He is so honest. He's given up on the theme.)

793
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:53,962
He was just randomly invited.

794
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,400
Next, let's meet Kwang Soo's doppelganger.

795
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,702
I've really wanted to meet him.

796
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,203
Is he here?

797
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:04,672
I put in so much effort. I did.

798
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:07,142
We've been talking about him for five years.

799
00:30:07,142 --> 00:30:08,543
My goodness.

800
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,745
We've been...

801
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:14,783
You're starting to look a lot like Han Gi Beom.

802
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:17,585
(Just the mention of his name cracked everyone up.)

803
00:30:17,585 --> 00:30:21,790
(Everyone except Kwang Soo believes the two are doppelgangers.)

804
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,125
Finally.

805
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:25,693
- Yes. - He's finally here.

806
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,530
I'm so nervous. What should I do?

807
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:31,299
Kwang Soo's doppelganger,

808
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:33,935
please come out!

809
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:37,872
(They are in awe...)

810
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:40,375
(and moved by his appearance.)

811
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:43,745
(No way. My legs are going weak now.)

812
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:49,851
(Hello?)

813
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:52,053
(You wanted to see me, didn't you?)

814
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:53,154
This is amazing.

815
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:55,323
(His appearance has the same effect of a dunk.)

816
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:58,059
- No way. He really came! Seriously! - My gosh, Gi Beom.

817
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,194
- My gosh. - It's nice to meet you.

818
00:30:59,194 --> 00:31:00,495
No way.

819
00:31:00,495 --> 00:31:02,530
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

820
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,666
- Does someone resemble me? - Seriously.

821
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:06,101
I can't believe this.

822
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:07,535
Hey, this is amazing.

823
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:09,704
Hey, lift your head up.

824
00:31:09,704 --> 00:31:11,573
(He quickly gets a pen.)

825
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:12,740
What are you doing?

826
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,609
Hey, he can't wash that off.

827
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:15,944
They're the same.

828
00:31:16,244 --> 00:31:18,913
- Do you really think we look alike? - Oh, no. He can't wash it off.

829
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,883
You two resemble each other. You two look really alike.

830
00:31:21,883 --> 00:31:23,184
Kwang Soo.

831
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:25,954
- He looks like your father. - I'm so embarrassed.

832
00:31:26,054 --> 00:31:27,655
- I'm so embarrassed. - You're the spitting image of him.

833
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,023
- Seriously. - I mean it.

834
00:31:30,024 --> 00:31:31,993
- I wanted to see both of them. - I...

835
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:33,394
I didn't look at them yet,

836
00:31:33,394 --> 00:31:35,063
but it'd drive me crazy if I glanced over.

837
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,865
Kwang Soo.

838
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:39,134
Now, I understand how you feel.

839
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,502
To be honest,

840
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:43,605
people pointed out the resemblance ever since elementary school.

841
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:45,573
(This is a historical day his dream of 20 years comes true.)

842
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,642
- I heard it ever since I was a kid. - My gosh, Kwang Soo will...

843
00:31:47,642 --> 00:31:51,513
- look like him when he gets old. - Exactly.

844
00:31:51,813 --> 00:31:54,883
- Let me introduce the last guest. - But who resembles So Min?

845
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:57,552
- But who resembles So Min? - So Min...

846
00:31:57,552 --> 00:31:59,554
- I have many faces. - Who is it?

847
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,623
- She resembles Son Yeo Eun. - Son Yeo Eun.

848
00:32:01,623 --> 00:32:03,191
She looks like Jung Yu Mi too.

849
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:04,893
- Is Yu Mi joining us today? - Really?

850
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,094
Jung Yu Mi. It's Yu Mi.

851
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,695
(I think it's Yu Mi.)

852
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:13,735
(When she smiles, she resembles So Min. Is she joining us today?)

853
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:15,970
Who is it?

854
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:20,575
(So Min's lookalike makes them laugh right away.)

855
00:32:22,744 --> 00:32:25,213
It's Han Min Gwan. It's Min Gwan.

856
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,849
(Unbelievable. Who is that? Where is Yu Mi?)

857
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,984
- I see the resemblance. - He does resemble her. He does.

858
00:32:29,984 --> 00:32:31,252
(The guests are invited according to the theme.)

859
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:32,820
- They do resemble each other. - They do look alike.

860
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,855
- I see the resemblance. - He does resemble her.

861
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,590
- Kwang Soo. - Hello.

862
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,125
- They do look alike. - My gosh.

863
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:41,663
(So Min's lookalike, Han Min Gwan)

864
00:32:41,663 --> 00:32:43,932
- What is it? - It's been five years since...

865
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,134
I had tried to stay away from him.

866
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:47,635
I was the female version of Min Gwan.

867
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,904
- We got you today. - You two look alike.

868
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:52,874
- Why do they say you resemble him? - Well, the project I was on...

869
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:55,810
When I was starring in a drama, people wrote...

870
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,946
that I resembled Min Gwan online.

871
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:00,181
That's why for the related keywords, his name and my name...

872
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,684
- were paired together. - I see.

873
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:05,220
Ever since then, my nickname became Prince Aurora.

874
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,389
(Ever since then, my nickname became Prince Aurora.)

875
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:09,824
- People started calling me that. - Not Princess Aurora?

876
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,025
- It wasn't Princess Aurora? - No.

877
00:33:11,025 --> 00:33:12,594
- Prince Aurora. - It's because...

878
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:16,064
back then, I weighed about 10kg less than I weigh now.

879
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,899
Since I was slimmer, I resembled him even more.

880
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,536
It's been a while since we had both Prince and Princess Aurora with us.

881
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,605
- They meet today. - Right.

882
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:25,940
- I see. But by the way, Jong Hyuk. - Yes?

883
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,643
You don't resemble him that much, but you're having fun today.

884
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:33,982
(As he blocks out the sun, he watches the show of lookalikes.)

885
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:35,483
- Jong Hyuk, enjoy yourself. - He's smiling.

886
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,285
All right, everyone.

887
00:33:37,285 --> 00:33:39,921
- Be yourself during the interview. - Just be yourself.

888
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:42,490
He's the best at interviewing people about their current lives.

889
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,025
- Right. - To Jae Seok,

890
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:46,094
- I'll interview them? - I'll pass on the script.

891
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:47,395
And we'll rest for a bit.

892
00:33:47,395 --> 00:33:49,063
(It was so hard.)

893
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:50,665
I can't do this.

894
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:51,733
- I'll take over? - Yes.

895
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:53,134
- This was Haha... - Yes, we will...

896
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:54,636
And Ok Jeong.

897
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:56,104
(They wrap up hurriedly.)

898
00:33:56,104 --> 00:33:58,773
- I'll take over for a moment. - Okay, okay.

899
00:33:58,773 --> 00:34:00,875
- Let's catch up for a while. - Should I stay here with you?

900
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:02,844
- First up is Woo Jong. - Yes.

901
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,412
- You're joining us today. - Yes.

902
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:07,615
Didn't people often tell you that you resembled Seok Jin?

903
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:11,386
- I heard that ever since my debut. - Okay.

904
00:34:11,386 --> 00:34:13,921
- Whom else do you resemble? - Actually,

905
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:15,990
the improved version would be Park Shin Yang.

906
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,325
- I see the resemblance. - My gosh.

907
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:18,459
- You can do his impression. - Park Shin Yang.

908
00:34:18,459 --> 00:34:20,561
- He can mimic his voice. - Yes, he can do that.

909
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:22,230
- Can you do that for us? - Park Shin Yang...

910
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:27,502
"I don't know how to act on this kind of a show."

911
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:29,671
"I don't know what I should do."

912
00:34:29,671 --> 00:34:31,105
"I'm very nervous."

913
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,574
"Baby, I'll buy you ice cream, so hang out with me."

914
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,743
- This is it. - He does sound like Shin Yang.

915
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,745
- He sounds just like Shin Yang. - I'm sure Seok Jin can do this too.

916
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:38,813
- Try it. - No, I can't do that.

917
00:34:38,813 --> 00:34:40,882
- You look like him. You can do it. - Try it. You can do it.

918
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,784
"Baby."

919
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:44,919
"I'm on this show today."

920
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:46,454
"I'm nervous that Woo Jong is joining us today."

921
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:48,323
Doesn't he just sound like an old man?

922
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,224
He sounds like an old lady.

923
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,360
- This was my first time. - "Hey."

924
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,095
- Hold on. Wait a second. - "Hey, the pot's boiling."

925
00:34:54,095 --> 00:34:55,863
- Next up is Ji Suk. - Okay, okay.

926
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:58,599
You joined us today as my lookalike,

927
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,435
- but you don't seem to agree. - Why not?

928
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:01,703
Then why did you agree to join us?

929
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,371
- Pardon? - Why did you agree to come today?

930
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,340
I wanted to star on Running Man.

931
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,042
You had an agenda. You had an ulterior motive.

932
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:09,143
To be honest, yes.

933
00:35:09,143 --> 00:35:11,379
To be honest, I didn't want to star for this special.

934
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:13,314
To clarify,

935
00:35:13,314 --> 00:35:14,949
- K.Will feels the same way, right? - Right.

936
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:16,551
- Right now... - This can't be right.

937
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:19,053
Jong Hyuk feels the same way too.

938
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,423
I was invited to come. When I saw Gi Beom in the waiting room,

939
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,692
I thought, "This cannot be happening."

940
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:27,095
And his name sounds similar too.

941
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:29,230
- His name has Suk. I'm Yu Jae Seok. - Right.

942
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:30,565
- Seo Ji Suk. - Seo Ji Suk.

943
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:32,333
- I see. - What does Suk mean in your name?

944
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:34,802
- That's not my real name. - It's not?

945
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,170
What?

946
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,673
Why do you sound disappointed?

947
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,675
- Why does that disappoint you? - That's not your real name?

948
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,009
Haha isn't my real name either.

949
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:43,745
I know. Yours is Ha Dong Hoon.

950
00:35:43,745 --> 00:35:45,079
- Ma'am. - Yes?

951
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,614
- Since we're on the subject... - Okay.

952
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:48,750
- Haha came up with his stage name. - Right.

953
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,785
- He chose it on his own. - Didn't that disappoint you?

954
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:52,420
No, it didn't disappoint me.

955
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,721
What upsets me the most is...

956
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:55,323
when my mom calls me Haha in crowded places.

957
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,591
(It's the other way around.)

958
00:35:56,591 --> 00:35:57,825
"Haha".

959
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,193
"Haha".

960
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:00,995
That's really disappointing.

961
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,363
- I just call his stage name. - I see.

962
00:36:02,363 --> 00:36:03,664
And as for her daughter-in-law,

963
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,134
"Byul". "Byul".

964
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:08,069
(She's the mother of celebrities.)

965
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,103
- It drives me crazy. - Next up are...

966
00:36:09,103 --> 00:36:11,072
- K.Will and Jong Kook. - All right.

967
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,274
These two do look alike,

968
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:15,143
- but both are great singers. - I agree.

969
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,544
- They are great singers. - Right.

970
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:18,813
And both of them can sing "She's Gone" really well.

971
00:36:18,813 --> 00:36:20,515
- "She's Gone"? - Yes, they are great.

972
00:36:20,515 --> 00:36:23,384
- This is news to me. - I see.

973
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,553
Come here.

974
00:36:25,853 --> 00:36:27,555
(I see. I was wrong.)

975
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:28,623
Come here.

976
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:29,791
- Come here. - Did you not research?

977
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,726
- I only said one thing. - What do you know about me?

978
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,294
You're just good at fighting.

979
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:36,130
(You're just good at fighting.)

980
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,565
You're good at that.

981
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,634
- Go back to your spot. - Yes, sir.

982
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:42,203
(Since you know something, I'll let you slide.)

983
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:46,340
We don't need to explain the next guest. It's Seong Moon.

984
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,342
- The resemblance is uncanny. - The resemblance is striking.

985
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,845
Whenever Seong Moon stars on our show,

986
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:55,349
you always expose one thing about Ji Hyo.

987
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:58,553
Is there anything you'd like to add onto the list?

988
00:36:58,553 --> 00:37:02,023
Since we're family, she's really comfortable around me.

989
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:06,761
When she uses the bathroom, she doesn't close...

990
00:37:07,361 --> 00:37:09,263
She leaves the door open. Right?

991
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:10,465
They're family. That's understandable.

992
00:37:10,465 --> 00:37:12,533
Ji Hyo, but still... That's...

993
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,836
- Shouldn't you close the door? - No, that's not it.

994
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:16,804
(I didn't know you'd share that.)

995
00:37:16,804 --> 00:37:18,773
Come on. Tell them the truth.

996
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,476
Seong Moon, you're too mean. How could you share that?

997
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:24,045
- No, I was watching TV. - Okay.

998
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:26,814
- I had to use the bathroom. - So?

999
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:29,083
- But I was curious about the show. - Okay.

1000
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,419
I walked back like this and left the door open.

1001
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,621
And I came back out after that.

1002
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:35,423
- That's why you didn't close it? - Ask So Min...

1003
00:37:35,423 --> 00:37:38,559
- Ask So Min how other siblings are. - That's why you didn't close it?

1004
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,994
To be honest, I also...

1005
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:42,463
- So Min, don't you do that too? - Yes, even if my brother is there.

1006
00:37:42,463 --> 00:37:43,731
- Exactly. - Seriously?

1007
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,733
- Siblings are like that? No way. - Brothers and sisters...

1008
00:37:45,733 --> 00:37:48,302
When my brother goes to get his underwear after taking a shower,

1009
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:49,604
he'd run across the room quickly.

1010
00:37:49,604 --> 00:37:51,606
He'd only cover his front. I'd see his bottom.

1011
00:37:52,673 --> 00:37:55,710
(Her description is very detailed with her hand gestures.)

1012
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,880
Don't do the hand gestures. Stop using your hands.

1013
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,250
My gosh, they are so free.

1014
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,819
- No, they're not. - Hey, just get a pot for peeing.

1015
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:07,755
(Brothers and sisters can be more at ease than same-gender siblings.)

1016
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:12,193
- But... - Wait, to Se Chan...

1017
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,294
To be honest, I feel so sorry.

1018
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,363
Jong Hyuk and I don't look alike at all.

1019
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,331
- We'll find something. - All right.

1020
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:19,233
- What's your blood type? - Yes, blood type.

1021
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:20,434
- 1, 2, 3. B. - A.

1022
00:38:20,434 --> 00:38:21,536
- Darn it. - Come on.

1023
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:22,503
- B. - A.

1024
00:38:22,503 --> 00:38:24,772
(Even their blood types aren't the same.)

1025
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:25,973
Darn it.

1026
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:28,075
Should we check the blood types?

1027
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,510
1, 2, 3.

1028
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,912
- A. - A.

1029
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:33,114
(Sighing)

1030
00:38:34,315 --> 00:38:37,351
- Even their blood type is the same. - Kwang Soo is more dejected now.

1031
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:41,923
Welcome to Haha Land. This is the Doppelganger Race.

1032
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:43,391
Since I'm a fashion enthusiast,

1033
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,360
I prepared a race where you will obtain your outfits.

1034
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,695
- Is that so? - It's a race.

1035
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:50,831
- This is very important. - Tell us about the rules.

1036
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:54,235
Members of Running Man and the guests...

1037
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:56,103
will pair up to form a team.

1038
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,675
They will buy an outfit with R Coins they earned throughout the show.

1039
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:04,245
They will film the TV rating notice in that outfit.

1040
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:09,183
All right. I will present you the outfits you will wear today.

1041
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:11,152
- I bet they will look weird. - I'm curious.

1042
00:39:11,152 --> 00:39:12,620
- The outfits. - I bet they look weird.

1043
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,090
(What are the outfits that will determine their looks for 4 weeks?)

1044
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,224
- I knew it. I saw this coming. - My gosh.

1045
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:18,593
- My gosh. - Look at that.

1046
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:20,294
(What are those outfits?)

1047
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,931
- We have to do the makeup too. - You'll do the makeup for Kaonashi.

1048
00:39:23,931 --> 00:39:26,133
(A fancy suit, Boy Frog, and Sailor Moon)

1049
00:39:26,434 --> 00:39:28,102
- I'd rather wear Kaonashi's outfit. - My gosh.

1050
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:30,004
My gosh, Toshio is on the list too.

1051
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:33,641
These are the outfits we'll wear for the TV rating notice.

1052
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,544
We don't need a guest for Kaonashi, do we?

1053
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,480
Their face might not be shown even if they came all the way here.

1054
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:40,881
I knew this would happen.

1055
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,383
- My gosh. - See?

1056
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:44,185
- My gosh. - I want to wear the suit.

1057
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:45,653
For the highest price,

1058
00:39:45,653 --> 00:39:48,823
the particular episode will be titled under the buyer's name.

1059
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,726
- It won't be Haha? - We have a shot?

1060
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:55,162
That's why you must try hard to acquire the money.

1061
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:57,164
And if you don't have enough money to buy the outfit,

1062
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,199
we'll provide elastic suits that...

1063
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,934
- cover the whole body for free. - Elastic suits?

1064
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:01,569
We'll paint your faces in the same color as the suit.

1065
00:40:02,103 --> 00:40:04,171
- I'm in trouble. - It'll be the same color.

1066
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,172
That's the worst.

1067
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,974
All right. After you change into your team uniforms,

1068
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,943
we'll begin the race.

1069
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:11,879
I bet people will be fighting over the outfits in the 10 R range.

1070
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:15,783
First, we'll begin Money Signal so you can earn your Seed Money.

1071
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:17,785
(Money Signal)

1072
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,053
(We have to win a lot of money.)

1073
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,054
What?

1074
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:21,455
(Let's try to stay away from the makeup.)

1075
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:24,392
Every couple will choose Signal Three Random cards randomly.

1076
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:28,029
You will try to complete the mission stage by stage.

1077
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,164
Every time you complete the mission, you will get 20 R...

1078
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:35,403
(What? His pronunciation is a bit weird.)

1079
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:36,904
- How can you say that? - My mother is here.

1080
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:38,072
How can you say that?

1081
00:40:38,072 --> 00:40:41,175
- My mother is here. - It's okay. This is a variety show.

1082
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:44,311
- Please be careful. - Say "20 seeds".

1083
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,781
- 20 seeds. - Every step you pass,

1084
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:48,783
you'll gain 20, 40, and 100 seeds.

1085
00:40:48,783 --> 00:40:50,951
You lose the chance to play if you fail.

1086
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,620
- Do you understand? - We must win no matter what.

1087
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,422
There are four types of games.

1088
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,190
One is Song Ji Hyo Game.

1089
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,459
Two members say a syllable each based on a given syllable.

1090
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,295
For example, "make a bowl".

1091
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,663
Another game is Say It in Reverse

1092
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:05,132
When "Australia" is given, you say "Ailartsua".

1093
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,001
It isn't easy today.

1094
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,869
- Why is it so difficult? - That's a hard game.

1095
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,504
Third is Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1096
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:13,474
If I say 3, you must say "giant chestnut bread" 3 times.

1097
00:41:13,474 --> 00:41:15,009
Fourth is Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1098
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:16,744
When a word is given,

1099
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:20,014
if you say the same syllable as your partner, you lose.

1100
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:22,149
- We have an advantage. - That's right.

1101
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:23,951
- We all have an advantage. - Woo Jong may be good too.

1102
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,119
He's an announcer.

1103
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,921
Which team would like to start first?

1104
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:30,124
- How about Seong Moon and Ji Hyo? - Let's start.

1105
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:32,460
For Lee Kwang Soo Game, the word is jjamppong.

1106
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,562
Jjamppong. In 3, 2, 1.

1107
00:41:35,062 --> 00:41:38,699
(He should not say the same syllable.)

1108
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:39,834
- Jjam. - Jjam.

1109
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:43,604
(She hits me.)

1110
00:41:43,604 --> 00:41:46,741
- What's wrong with losing? - Aren't you on the same team?

1111
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:48,642
- They're doppelgangers. - She hit him.

1112
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:50,911
(Ji Hyo hits him well, and Seong Moon has a short temper.)

1113
00:41:50,911 --> 00:41:52,880
What's going on?

1114
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,682
Don't hit him. It's difficult.

1115
00:41:54,682 --> 00:41:55,850
She said not to hit him.

1116
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,984
(They fail the first step.)

1117
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,220
You should speak your mind.

1118
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,089
Unlike the sweet woman in "Something in the Rain",

1119
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:03,824
- not all women are sweet. - She isn't warm and generous.

1120
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:06,494
- Those only exists in dramas. - Seong Moon.

1121
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,963
The female character is Son Ye Jin.

1122
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:10,564
What type of woman is Ji Hyo?

1123
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,433
(How does he think of Ji Hyo?)

1124
00:42:12,433 --> 00:42:13,901
She makes good sounds.

1125
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,269
- She makes good sounds? - Yes.

1126
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,604
What kind of sounds?

1127
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,672
"She makes good sounds"?

1128
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,274
(What does he mean?)

1129
00:42:20,274 --> 00:42:22,409
I mean in the bathroom.

1130
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:26,113
(It's what he mentioned earlier.)

1131
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,681
- Come on. - Hey.

1132
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:30,584
You can't say that in public.

1133
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:33,020
- She must make sounds. - Ji Hyo.

1134
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:35,156
She's someone who makes good sounds.

1135
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,424
That's hilarious.

1136
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:40,561
Next up are K.Will and Jong Kook.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1137
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,263
- Okay. - Step one.

1138
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,064
It's Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1139
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,933
Say "Symbols of Longevity" five times. Start.

1140
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:49,103
Symbols of Longevity, Symbols of Longevity, Symbols of Longevity...

1141
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:50,471
(They pass Step 1.)

1142
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:51,772
That's easy.

1143
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,574
This is Song Ji Hyo Game. C.

1144
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:55,342
- Cro. - Crow.

1145
00:42:55,643 --> 00:42:57,244
It's Say It in Reverse. "Red dragonfly".

1146
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:59,213
(The word is red dragonfly.)

1147
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:01,081
Ylf... Goodness.

1148
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,250
(Wrong)

1149
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:04,718
They passed two steps.

1150
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:07,154
- You still passed two times. - That was smart.

1151
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,622
Their word was crow.

1152
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:11,025
- You passed step two. - That was great.

1153
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,193
(They win 40 R.)

1154
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:14,562
"Symbols of Longevity" was easy.

1155
00:43:14,562 --> 00:43:15,963
That was too easy.

1156
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:19,033
- Symbols of Longevity... - That's so easy.

1157
00:43:19,033 --> 00:43:20,134
It was too easy.

1158
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:22,803
We aren't allowed to say "Symbols of Longevity" on TV.

1159
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,538
- Why not? - No way.

1160
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:27,374
- It sounds offensive. - What do you mean?

1161
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:28,509
It's not allowed.

1162
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:31,312
Shall I show you something that isn't allowed on TV?

1163
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:33,614
(Is this how you'll play?)

1164
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:34,882
Hit him.

1165
00:43:35,883 --> 00:43:38,419
- You should get him. - The screen can be blurred.

1166
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,421
My goodness.

1167
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:42,623
(I'll keep to myself.)

1168
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:44,658
- Goodness. - It's your turn, ma'am.

1169
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:46,493
You must make it, ma'am.

1170
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:49,330
- Please, Mom. - It's Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1171
00:43:49,363 --> 00:43:51,632
Say "counsel in charge" five times. Start.

1172
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,734
(The word is "counsel in charge".)

1173
00:43:53,734 --> 00:43:55,135
Giant chestnut bread.

1174
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:58,239
(She has no idea.)

1175
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,409
(She says giant chestnut bread instead of "counsel in charge".)

1176
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:04,478
- Haha. - Wait.

1177
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:06,013
Don't make fun of my mom!

1178
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,414
- That's right. - Don't.

1179
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,950
- We aren't making fun of her. - She was so cute.

1180
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,719
- It was because she was cute. - We weren't making fun.

1181
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,221
- Don't make fun of her. - We weren't.

1182
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:16,390
- Don't make fun of her. - We weren't making fun of her.

1183
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,025
That's not what we meant.

1184
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:19,293
- We weren't making fun of her. - Wait.

1185
00:44:19,293 --> 00:44:21,862
- We weren't. - Let me take a look.

1186
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:23,964
- No. - Please don't do this.

1187
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,499
- I can't look? - No.

1188
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:28,302
It's over.

1189
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:29,904
- This is hilarious. - Goodness.

1190
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:31,705
Give us a chance to play Song Ji Hyo Game.

1191
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:33,874
- Song Ji Hyo Game? - It's already over.

1192
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,142
How do you play it?

1193
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,944
- It's when they said, "crow". - That one?

1194
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:38,812
- Let's start again. - Here we go.

1195
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:41,215
This is Song Ji Hyo Game.

1196
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:42,383
Spring.

1197
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:43,984
Butterfly.

1198
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:46,553
(It's incorrect.)

1199
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:49,223
(She says butterfly instead of one syllable.)

1200
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:50,824
Was it wrong? What was it?

1201
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:52,693
- Say 1 syllable. - Just 1?

1202
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:53,894
(Was it just one syllable?)

1203
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,296
It's not easy.

1204
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,064
- Say only one syllable. - This is impossible.

1205
00:44:57,064 --> 00:44:58,332
It won't work, Haha.

1206
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,434
- Don't laugh! - She's so cute.

1207
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:02,970
- Look at Kwang Soo. - You're cute.

1208
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,372
- "Spring butterfly" is a good word. - I know.

1209
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,141
We're laughing out of happiness.

1210
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,943
She's so lovely.

1211
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:11,745
It's okay. This is funnier.

1212
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:14,515
It's our turn. Let's go, Ji Suk.

1213
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:17,384
It's Say It in Reverse. The word is "omurice".

1214
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,054
(The word is "omurice".)

1215
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:21,121
Iricemo.

1216
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:22,623
(Impressed)

1217
00:45:22,623 --> 00:45:23,891
- Is that right? - No.

1218
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:24,925
(That's the wrong answer.)

1219
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:27,928
(They're impressed by themselves.)

1220
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,463
- That's wrong. - It's incorrect.

1221
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:30,864
(Ji Suk's answer is wrong.)

1222
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,199
Did you see that?

1223
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,335
- He's a crook. - He's a crook.

1224
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:36,570
- He was so confident. - You're a crook.

1225
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,105
I thought he was right.

1226
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:39,873
- They're the same. - Unbelievable.

1227
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:41,742
- They almost tricked us. - They're similar.

1228
00:45:41,742 --> 00:45:44,645
- They're both crooks. - They were almost believable.

1229
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:47,314
It's considered correct if you answer with confidence.

1230
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,783
- How could you? - Confidence is important.

1231
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,986
They almost tricked us.

1232
00:45:51,986 --> 00:45:55,589
When I applauded, he was quite flustered.

1233
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:57,524
- Show that you're an announcer. - What?

1234
00:45:57,524 --> 00:45:59,393
- Who will start? - Woo Jong will start.

1235
00:45:59,393 --> 00:46:02,262
It's Lee Kwang Soo Game. The word is bag.

1236
00:46:02,262 --> 00:46:04,164
It's either ba or ag. In 3, 2, 1.

1237
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,332
- Ba. - Ba.

1238
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:07,868
(They say the same syllable.)

1239
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:08,969
Wasn't I right?

1240
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,772
(I said the same syllable.)

1241
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:13,741
- You were wrong. - They should be different.

1242
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:15,709
- Didn't I get it right? - You said the same syllabus.

1243
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,211
Why is he on my team?

1244
00:46:17,745 --> 00:46:19,813
- He doesn't understand rules too. - They're similar.

1245
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:21,081
- They're similar that way. - Right.

1246
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:24,084
- He can't understand like me. - It was the sound.

1247
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,553
As time passes by,

1248
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,123
it becomes clear which teams are terrible.

1249
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:30,824
(It becomes more obvious.)

1250
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:32,593
That's strange.

1251
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:34,061
It already started.

1252
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,764
Next are Min Gwan and So Min.

1253
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:39,233
- They're strangely similar. - Let's start.

1254
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:42,169
(Why is he standing behind them?)

1255
00:46:42,169 --> 00:46:44,271
He's similar to Kwang Soo in his behavior.

1256
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:46,573
(He acts like a trickster similar to Kwang Soo.)

1257
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:47,741
What are you doing?

1258
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,610
(Why are you over there?)

1259
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,745
- He wants to practice. - I wanted to practice.

1260
00:46:51,745 --> 00:46:54,014
- He's just like Kwang Soo. - He's innocent.

1261
00:46:54,014 --> 00:46:55,582
- No. - Seriously.

1262
00:46:55,582 --> 00:46:56,583
They're similar.

1263
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:57,951
(Gi Beom simply wants to practice.)

1264
00:46:57,951 --> 00:47:00,654
- It's because he's innocent. - He's similar to you.

1265
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:01,755
(He wanted to practice.)

1266
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:03,724
- I wanted to practice. - The way he acts...

1267
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:06,160
I felt a breeze above my head.

1268
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,128
- It's to practice. - He isn't bothering them.

1269
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:09,663
- He's innocent. - I just want to practice.

1270
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:12,132
They're somewhat similar.

1271
00:47:12,132 --> 00:47:14,134
Min Gwan will start first.

1272
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,203
It's Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1273
00:47:16,203 --> 00:47:18,572
Say "double muntin" five times. Start.

1274
00:47:18,572 --> 00:47:20,340
Double muntin, double muntin...

1275
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,076
Come on.

1276
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:25,345
(He fails to pronounce the word.)

1277
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,980
My tongue is short.

1278
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,650
- It's both of your faults. - My tongue is short.

1279
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,518
It's because my tongue is short.

1280
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:33,454
(So Min's team fails.)

1281
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,855
That's hilarious.

1282
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:36,890
(She gets angry.)

1283
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:38,425
- My tongue is short. - So Min.

1284
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:40,561
- You'll get a bodysuit. - He's so annoying.

1285
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:41,962
Let's play Pirate Roulette Game.

1286
00:47:41,962 --> 00:47:44,264
- So Min will wear a bodysuit. - I'll do better.

1287
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,133
- Are we the last team? - Yes.

1288
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,401
He looks nervous.

1289
00:47:47,401 --> 00:47:48,635
All right.

1290
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:51,238
First is Song Ji Hyo Game. Yang.

1291
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:53,073
(The given syllable is yang.)

1292
00:47:53,073 --> 00:47:54,141
You can do it.

1293
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:57,644
(Please make a word like cabbage.)

1294
00:47:57,644 --> 00:47:58,712
Gangster.

1295
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,080
(Gangster)

1296
00:48:00,914 --> 00:48:02,983
(He says both syllables.)

1297
00:48:02,983 --> 00:48:04,184
"Gangster"?

1298
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:06,120
I said, "gangster".

1299
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,856
- No, you must say one syllable. - It's one syllable.

1300
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:11,391
He said, "gangster". He's just like Kwang Soo.

1301
00:48:11,391 --> 00:48:14,928
- He's just like Kwang Soo. - He's Lee Kwang Soo!

1302
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:17,064
He made the same mistake as Haha's mother.

1303
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,433
- He did the same. - Now, I understand.

1304
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,034
I understand now.

1305
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,369
Why did you say that word?

1306
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:23,770
- He's just like you. - No.

1307
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:26,573
Their similar personalities become more obvious.

1308
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:28,742
- Right. - It's becoming obvious.

1309
00:48:28,742 --> 00:48:31,278
He even thinks like Kwang Soo.

1310
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:34,114
We gave you a chance to earn Seed Money.

1311
00:48:34,114 --> 00:48:36,850
- However, you didn't win any. - Let us play more.

1312
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,153
- Give us one more chance. - Give us a chance.

1313
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:42,322
- Play Giant Chestnut Bread Game. - How about Lee Kwang Soo Game?

1314
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,891
- Play Giant Chestnut Bread Game. - Let's play Lee Kwang Soo Game.

1315
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:45,792
- Lee Kwang Soo Game. - Let's keep it simple.

1316
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,594
Lee Kwang Soo Game isn't fun.

1317
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:49,930
(He's very opposed to it.)

1318
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,565
Did you have to say that?

1319
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:53,200
He selected the game, so don't say that.

1320
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,935
- Play Giant Chestnut Bread Game. - Is that it?

1321
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:56,203
Yes.

1322
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:57,704
- My tongue is too short. - It's difficult.

1323
00:48:57,704 --> 00:49:00,140
- The pronunciation is hard. - I like that game.

1324
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:03,544
Let's play Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1325
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:05,913
Say "Cheol Soo's desk" five times. Start.

1326
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,715
Cheol Soo's desk, Cheol Soo's desk, Cheol Soo's desk, Cheol Soo's desk.

1327
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:10,784
- Okay. - You mispronounced it.

1328
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:12,419
(He fails.)

1329
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,388
- He said "Cheol Shoo". - "Cheol Shoo".

1330
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:17,724
- "Cheol Shoo". It's wrong. - He mispronounced the desk.

1331
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:20,494
Is that how you'll play? Fine, just wait and see.

1332
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:23,530
- Is that how you'll play? - It's wrong.

1333
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,533
- Okay, bring it on. - Good job, Se Chan.

1334
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:28,268
- It's okay, you did well. - It's Seong Moon's turn.

1335
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:30,003
It's Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1336
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,538
Say "Doctor of law" five times. Start.

1337
00:49:31,538 --> 00:49:34,608
Doctor of law, doctor of law, doctor of law, doctor of law...

1338
00:49:34,708 --> 00:49:36,410
(It's a success.)

1339
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,744
We got it.

1340
00:49:37,744 --> 00:49:38,745
"Cloud drawing".

1341
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:41,081
Cloud drawing, cloud drawing, cloud drawing, cloud drawing.

1342
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,150
- That's too easy. - It was...

1343
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,819
- too easy for them. - He's good.

1344
00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:47,454
That team is good at everything.

1345
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:50,524
- This is Giant Chestnut Bread Game. - It's hard.

1346
00:49:50,524 --> 00:49:51,992
The word is "red bean porridge".

1347
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:55,862
Red bean porridge, red bean porridge, red bean porridge...

1348
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:57,531
(The word is "red bean porridge".)

1349
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,299
It's correct.

1350
00:49:59,299 --> 00:50:01,468
(Are you not going to give her a pass?)

1351
00:50:02,236 --> 00:50:05,105
- This is wrong. - What's going on?

1352
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,340
She mispronounced it.

1353
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,075
Parents' Day is coming up.

1354
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:10,444
(How dare you say that she's wrong?)

1355
00:50:10,978 --> 00:50:13,080
Have you ever given her a present?

1356
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,583
- 20 seeds are worthless outside. - Stop it.

1357
00:50:16,683 --> 00:50:18,986
- I'm sorry, Haha. - Stop it.

1358
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:21,054
- Be good to parents. - It's a rule.

1359
00:50:21,054 --> 00:50:22,189
It's just a rule.

1360
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,124
- Ma'am. - My belly button hurts.

1361
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,792
(She finds it funny.)

1362
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,361
Why does your belly button hurt?

1363
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:29,630
Why does your belly button hurt?

1364
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,864
(The producer says that it's wrong.)

1365
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,600
- Does your belly button hurt? - It's so funny.

1366
00:50:33,834 --> 00:50:36,670
Here we go. Say, "counsel in charge" five times.

1367
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,805
Counsel in charge, counsel in charge, counsel in charge...

1368
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:40,073
Wrong!

1369
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:41,441
Why?

1370
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:43,644
Anyone could do that.

1371
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,813
"Counsel in charge, counsel in charge, counsel in charge..."

1372
00:50:46,813 --> 00:50:49,249
"Counsel in charge..." Wrong.

1373
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:50,984
"Probability distribution", start.

1374
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,353
Probability distribution, probability distribution,

1375
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:55,022
probability distribution, probability distribution...

1376
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:56,823
Stop distracting him.

1377
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,259
- It's even hard for an announcer. - It's even hard for an announcer.

1378
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,328
- I'm not confident about this. - You can do this.

1379
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:04,631
Giant Chestnut Bread Game. Say the word five times.

1380
00:51:04,631 --> 00:51:09,703
"Single layer..."

1381
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,605
Hold on.

1382
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:14,074
- He can't even say it himself. - He can't do it.

1383
00:51:14,074 --> 00:51:16,009
How are we going to do that?

1384
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:18,312
(The members are furious.)

1385
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:20,213
You can't even say it once.

1386
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:22,182
We'll just give up.

1387
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,684
It's too hard.

1388
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:26,253
I'll give you an easy one then. Giant Chestnut Bread Game.

1389
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:29,089
Say, "kim satgat satgat", five times.

1390
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:33,093
Kim satgat satgat, kim satgat satgat...

1391
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:34,761
That was too easy.

1392
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,864
- That was too easy. - He said, "kim satga satga".

1393
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:40,534
- He said, "satga". - "Satga" is not okay.

1394
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:42,402
- You win 20 seeds. - Okay.

1395
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:43,670
(He wins 20 seeds.)

1396
00:51:43,704 --> 00:51:44,771
I'm looking forward.

1397
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:47,874
- He's been practicing all along. - I know.

1398
00:51:47,874 --> 00:51:49,710
(While the other teams were playing...)

1399
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,545
(Counsel in charge...)

1400
00:51:51,545 --> 00:51:53,680
(Antibacterial effect...)

1401
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,550
(Gi Beom never stopped practicing.)

1402
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:59,086
Giant Chestnut Bread Game. Say the word five times.

1403
00:51:59,086 --> 00:52:00,554
"Choi Champan's house", start.

1404
00:52:00,554 --> 00:52:04,691
(Just do as you've been practicing.)

1405
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:08,495
Choi Champan's house, Choi Champan's house...

1406
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:10,230
(Choi Champan's house, Choi Champan's house...)

1407
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,899
(Heavy rain watch)

1408
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:14,234
Choi Champan's house...

1409
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:15,602
(It's not over yet!)

1410
00:52:15,602 --> 00:52:17,471
He was spitting.

1411
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:18,705
He got too worked up.

1412
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:20,440
"Choi Champan's house..."

1413
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,275
(Gi Beom's spitting makes everyone laugh.)

1414
00:52:22,275 --> 00:52:24,644
This is so funny.

1415
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:26,513
It was difficult.

1416
00:52:26,513 --> 00:52:27,981
- It was difficult. - It was.

1417
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:29,783
I like you so much.

1418
00:52:29,783 --> 00:52:32,252
The younger brother is never the equal of the older.

1419
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:35,288
Kwang Soo is overshadowed by Gi Beom today.

1420
00:52:35,288 --> 00:52:38,091
You guys seem to be struggling at this.

1421
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:39,393
Give another chance to the teams with no seeds.

1422
00:52:39,393 --> 00:52:40,694
Yes, please.

1423
00:52:40,694 --> 00:52:42,162
- Teams with no seeds... - Yes.

1424
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:43,363
- No seeds... - How many teams are they?

1425
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:46,933
Haha's, Jae Seok's, Seok Jin's, and Kwang Soo's.

1426
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:48,702
I'll give another chance to one member of each team.

1427
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,738
- Let's play Lee Kwang Soo Game. - Lee Kwang Soo Game?

1428
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:54,374
- We'll start from Woo Jong. - Okay.

1429
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:57,611
"Sparrow". Say either "spar" or "row".

1430
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:59,279
- 1, 2, 3. - "Spar".

1431
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,881
It's harder than I expected.

1432
00:53:00,881 --> 00:53:03,550
- We failed last time too. - You said the same one again.

1433
00:53:03,683 --> 00:53:06,520
"Big Bang". Say either "big" or "bang". 1, 2, 3.

1434
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,754
- Bang. - Bang.

1435
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,724
- Didn't you say, "big"? - No. He said, "bang".

1436
00:53:10,724 --> 00:53:12,893
- "Basketball". - "Basketball".

1437
00:53:12,893 --> 00:53:15,529
Say either "basket" or "ball". 1, 2, 3.

1438
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:16,730
- Basket. - Ball.

1439
00:53:16,763 --> 00:53:17,964
Yes!

1440
00:53:17,964 --> 00:53:20,100
He sounded so confident.

1441
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:22,569
He sure is a former basketball player.

1442
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:25,572
- My goodness. - Gi Beom sounded so confident.

1443
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:26,873
We'll do "ambition".

1444
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:29,443
Okay. Say either "am" or "bition".

1445
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:31,278
- 1, 2, 3. Am. - Bition.

1446
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:32,612
There you go.

1447
00:53:32,612 --> 00:53:36,183
(She said it after the producer.)

1448
00:53:36,183 --> 00:53:37,784
There you go.

1449
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:40,053
(There clearly was an interval.)

1450
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:42,155
I want to try "vision".

1451
00:53:42,155 --> 00:53:47,260
(You said it after hearing what the producer said.)

1452
00:53:47,661 --> 00:53:50,163
(My mom is the best, right?)

1453
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:51,431
Let me try "vision".

1454
00:53:51,431 --> 00:53:53,433
- This is so funny. - No way.

1455
00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:55,035
- One more time. - Say the word he gives you.

1456
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:57,204
Let's try "vision".

1457
00:53:57,204 --> 00:53:58,572
You have to say it at the same time with him.

1458
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:00,974
- "Vision". - Say either "vi" or "sion".

1459
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:02,476
"Vision". 1, 2, 3.

1460
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:03,643
- Vi. - Sion.

1461
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:07,180
(They succeed by a narrow margin.)

1462
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,482
That's a relief.

1463
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,484
What do you think?

1464
00:54:11,585 --> 00:54:13,253
- It counts. - I was so nervous.

1465
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:15,989
- You won 20 seeds. - I was scared.

1466
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,191
(R Coin Distribution)

1467
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,961
The game will start soon.

1468
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:23,730
We'll have 2 teams of 4.

1469
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,133
Each team will share all the R coins within the team.

1470
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:30,303
(Each team will share the R coins.)

1471
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:32,038
- That's a relief. - The worst would be...

1472
00:54:32,138 --> 00:54:34,608
to become a team with Woo Jong and Seok Jin.

1473
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,309
We have nothing.

1474
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,278
Each team will then...

1475
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:41,615
distribute the coins among four bags.

1476
00:54:41,615 --> 00:54:42,682
The winning team...

1477
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:45,285
can choose one member on the other team...

1478
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,420
and take the coins in the member's bag.

1479
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,688
(The winning team can take the other team's coins.)

1480
00:54:48,688 --> 00:54:49,923
That might make a huge difference.

1481
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:52,893
Let's decide the teams by drawing spoons.

1482
00:54:52,893 --> 00:54:54,060
You never know.

1483
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,229
It'd be best to become a team with Jong Kook.

1484
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:58,064
Right. The more coins, the better.

1485
00:54:58,064 --> 00:55:00,400
- Yes, we have the most coins. - We should...

1486
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,269
- Here he comes. - Draw one.

1487
00:55:02,269 --> 00:55:03,503
You draw one.

1488
00:55:03,503 --> 00:55:04,871
We should avoid...

1489
00:55:05,238 --> 00:55:06,873
We should avoid teams that are broke.

1490
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:09,943
- Don't say that. - What's wrong?

1491
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,912
Is it a bad thing to say?

1492
00:55:11,912 --> 00:55:14,114
- Let's see Se Chan's spoon. - Okay. Jong Hyuk.

1493
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:15,415
1, 2, 3.

1494
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:17,584
- It's green. - Green. Okay.

1495
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:19,185
Ours is green.

1496
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:20,554
(Jong Kook and K.Will have a green spoon.)

1497
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:22,556
Okay! Jong Kook!

1498
00:55:23,123 --> 00:55:24,190
I love him when this happens.

1499
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:27,794
(I love him when this happens.)

1500
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,030
- Come here. - I'm just happy.

1501
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,465
- When do you not like me? - I always like you.

1502
00:55:32,465 --> 00:55:33,934
I like you especially a lot today.

1503
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:36,503
- I did a good job. - You did.

1504
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:39,139
(R Coin Distribution)

1505
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:40,974
(Green, Yellow, Blue, Red)

1506
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:44,544
Take your bags...

1507
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:47,981
and write down the amount of coins each bag will have.

1508
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:49,683
- Okay. - Within the total amount.

1509
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,618
- We write it down? - Yes.

1510
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,620
The other team can take away that much amount.

1511
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,988
- Distribute the coins well. - Okay.

1512
00:55:54,988 --> 00:55:56,222
(The winning team can take away money from one bag.)

1513
00:55:56,423 --> 00:55:58,024
- What are we going to do? - Are we putting all coins in one?

1514
00:55:58,024 --> 00:56:00,360
- Or are we distributing them? - Should we distribute them?

1515
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,029
Let's put a lot in one and nothing in another.

1516
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,031
What about 30 and 10?

1517
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:06,733
- Good. - 30 and 10?

1518
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,635
- 30 and 10. - 30 and 10.

1519
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:09,970
- 80 in one bag? - That might be better.

1520
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,571
80 in one bag?

1521
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,872
- Yes. - Yes.

1522
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:14,574
But in whose bag?

1523
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:17,344
Should we decide randomly?

1524
00:56:17,811 --> 00:56:19,613
- Let's put all in one. - That'd be better.

1525
00:56:19,613 --> 00:56:21,014
Let's do that.

1526
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:22,782
- In which bag? - Rock-paper-scissors?

1527
00:56:22,782 --> 00:56:23,783
Okay.

1528
00:56:23,783 --> 00:56:25,385
- 20 R in the winner's bag. - Okay.

1529
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:27,887
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1530
00:56:28,622 --> 00:56:31,591
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1531
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:33,760
Put everything in your bag.

1532
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,861
(They put 20 in Woo Jong's bag.)

1533
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:37,664
- Write it down. - Hold on.

1534
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:40,900
The 20 belongs to us.

1535
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:44,337
That's right. I completely forgot.

1536
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:46,272
Think about it. It belongs to us.

1537
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:47,674
We're a team.

1538
00:56:47,674 --> 00:56:49,943
- Rock-paper-scissors... - Whose idea was it?

1539
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:51,611
What do you think about this?

1540
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:53,013
I'm the one who won it.

1541
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,681
(I'm the one who won it.)

1542
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:57,684
Hold on. Aren't we a team?

1543
00:56:57,784 --> 00:56:59,152
We won it together.

1544
00:56:59,152 --> 00:57:02,756
That's right. That's right.

1545
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,759
(They're done distributing the money.)

1546
00:57:06,793 --> 00:57:09,863
(With the members having become close, the first round starts.)

1547
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:11,464
What's that?

1548
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:13,833
(They haven't seen hop balls in a while.)

1549
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:15,468
A banana?

1550
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:16,503
(What game are they going to play?)

1551
00:57:16,503 --> 00:57:18,238
- Everyone. - Yes.

1552
00:57:18,238 --> 00:57:21,775
Haha Land TV Rating Notice Race. Round One.

1553
00:57:21,775 --> 00:57:24,811
Let's start the national survey quiz.

1554
00:57:24,811 --> 00:57:26,880
(National Survey Quiz)

1555
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,615
Let's start the national survey quiz.

1556
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:30,183
Survey?

1557
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:33,753
We surveyed 500 people in their 20s to 40s.

1558
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:35,822
After hearing the question,

1559
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:38,558
you'll move to the banana on the hop ball.

1560
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:41,928
Take a bite of the banana, and you'll get to say your answer.

1561
00:57:41,928 --> 00:57:43,129
(The winning team will receive 30 R.)

1562
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:44,898
We have to eat the banana?

1563
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:46,933
Ji Seok, you and I should do this.

1564
00:57:46,933 --> 00:57:49,436
(Each team's ace steps up.)

1565
00:57:49,436 --> 00:57:50,603
We have to take our shoes off?

1566
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:53,073
It's okay to cheat and attack others.

1567
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:55,341
You can do anything.

1568
00:57:55,875 --> 00:57:57,677
Don't be surprised if someone pushes you.

1569
00:57:57,677 --> 00:57:59,713
Stay in your place. They'll try to push you away.

1570
00:57:59,713 --> 00:58:01,881
(Ji Seok seems relaxed.)

1571
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:03,083
How...

1572
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,454
- What happened? - Hey.

1573
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:10,290
(He suddenly falls.)

1574
00:58:10,423 --> 00:58:12,292
We haven't even started yet.

1575
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,761
- What are you doing? - Is this slapstick?

1576
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:17,664
You said you were good at sports.

1577
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:20,533
- What are you doing? - He's clumsy.

1578
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:23,603
- Can we change the player? - Yes.

1579
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:24,704
(Players for Round 1)

1580
00:58:24,704 --> 00:58:26,039
(Haha, Ji Suk, Gi Beom, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, Se Chan, Ji Hyo, So Min)

1581
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:28,908
I'm next to Jong Kook. What should I do?

1582
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:31,978
- This is... - I'm in trouble.

1583
00:58:32,445 --> 00:58:35,048
- Gi Beom, good luck. - Thanks.

1584
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:36,783
Haha, good luck.

1585
00:58:38,017 --> 00:58:39,319
Haha, good luck.

1586
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:41,521
Call me Dong Hoon.

1587
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:44,357
Dong Hoon, good luck. David, good luck.

1588
00:58:44,357 --> 00:58:45,358
- David. - David.

1589
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:47,193
- I gave him that name. - You did?

1590
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:49,863
- You call him David? - Yes. David is warm-hearted.

1591
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,532
- David. - David.

1592
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,501
I called him David when he was little.

1593
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,269
When, Mom?

1594
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:58,972
You never called me David once.

1595
00:58:58,972 --> 00:58:59,973
(You never called me David once.)

1596
00:58:59,973 --> 00:59:01,941
- David is warm-hearted. - David.

1597
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:03,443
Isn't it nice?

1598
00:59:03,443 --> 00:59:04,911
(David is ready.)

1599
00:59:04,911 --> 00:59:07,647
You bought an expensive present for your boyfriend or girlfriend,

1600
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:11,251
but your parents thought it was for them...

1601
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:13,353
and bragged to everyone.

1602
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,123
- Number one, you take it back. - That's hard.

1603
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:19,759
Number two, you let your parents keep it.

1604
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:22,862
- What would people have answered? - Parents should keep it.

1605
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,364
Parents should keep it.

1606
00:59:24,664 --> 00:59:27,901
But we need to think about what most people...

1607
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,903
- would have answered. Okay, Ji Suk? - Yes.

1608
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,404
- Okay, Haha? - Yes.

1609
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:32,639
Ready.

1610
00:59:32,806 --> 00:59:34,974
(The first round starts.)

1611
00:59:35,608 --> 00:59:38,178
(Jong Kook charges ahead while making weird sounds.)

1612
00:59:38,178 --> 00:59:40,880
(Shouting)

1613
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,116
- Good! - Go!

1614
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:45,351
Ji Suk.

1615
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,053
My goodness.

1616
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,290
(Jong Kook is highly likely to win.)

1617
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,160
No. This is not okay.

1618
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,563
(Ji Hyo catches up.)

1619
00:59:56,963 --> 00:59:59,566
(From the outermost lane, Ji Hyo gets to the banana first.)

1620
00:59:59,566 --> 01:00:01,067
(Proud)

1621
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,403
(She has to take a bite of the banana.)

1622
01:00:05,405 --> 01:00:08,007
(From the outermost lane, Ji Hyo gets to the banana first.)

1623
01:00:08,007 --> 01:00:09,509
(Proud)

1624
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:11,845
(She has to take a bite of the banana.)

1625
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:14,581
(Punching)

1626
01:00:14,848 --> 01:00:17,750
(Se Chan blocks her.)

1627
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:19,285
She didn't eat it.

1628
01:00:19,285 --> 01:00:21,487
(Kwang Soo opens his mouth.)

1629
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:23,356
Kwang Soo.

1630
01:00:23,356 --> 01:00:25,925
(While they fight, the hyena Kwang Soo steals the banana.)

1631
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,795
Kwang Soo.

1632
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:30,196
- What was that? - Oh, my.

1633
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:32,599
I blocked Ji Hyo.

1634
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:34,167
I had the banana here.

1635
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:35,869
I brought it up to my mouth. Kwang Soo.

1636
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:37,670
- I'm sorry, Ji Hyo. - My gosh.

1637
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:41,241
(Kwang Soo gets a chance to answer the question.)

1638
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:42,909
I blocked her, and Kwang Soo came.

1639
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,411
- What is the answer, Kwang Soo? - She didn't eat it.

1640
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:47,680
Just give it to my parents.

1641
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,781
Wrong.

1642
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:50,116
- You have to get it back. - Wrong.

1643
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:52,185
- It's expensive. - It's Parents' Day soon.

1644
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:53,486
It's expensive.

1645
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,955
(Kwang Soo is correct.)

1646
01:00:55,955 --> 01:00:58,358
Kwang Soo, you did it.

1647
01:00:58,358 --> 01:00:59,726
- Good job. - You did it.

1648
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:01,794
She almost took a bite.

1649
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:03,796
She took a longer route.

1650
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:04,998
Se Chan is taking care of Ji Hyo,

1651
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,966
not Seong Moon.

1652
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:08,468
- Seong Moon. - Seong Moon.

1653
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,937
Why do you have your arms crossed? She got her face dirty.

1654
01:01:10,937 --> 01:01:12,505
- It's okay. - That's realistic.

1655
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:15,041
That's what real brothers and sisters do.

1656
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,209
They're realistic.

1657
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:18,111
Seong Moon, I have a question.

1658
01:01:18,111 --> 01:01:21,147
Ji Hyo doesn't usually talk about this.

1659
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:26,085
She had boyfriends in the past, right?

1660
01:01:26,286 --> 01:01:28,321
- Yes. - Right?

1661
01:01:28,755 --> 01:01:30,890
She looks anxious. I'm just joking.

1662
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:32,492
(Hold on.)

1663
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,027
I'm just joking.

1664
01:01:34,227 --> 01:01:35,628
(Time out.)

1665
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:36,996
- Ji Hyo. - It's not true.

1666
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,799
(Stop it.)

1667
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:42,735
(She tries to edit out the whole segment.)

1668
01:01:43,636 --> 01:01:44,671
(She tries to control the media since her brother is here.)

1669
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:45,905
Stop it.

1670
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,206
She looks anxious.

1671
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:51,210
Jong Kook, you're not married. Did you give somebody a gift?

1672
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:52,578
On birthdays...

1673
01:01:52,578 --> 01:01:54,647
or special days, I always write letters.

1674
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:56,749
- Really? - I always do.

1675
01:01:56,749 --> 01:01:58,952
I write letters or cards.

1676
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:00,486
Are you talking about chain letters?

1677
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:03,156
Do you want one?

1678
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:04,557
(This letter started in Britain and the first recipient got lucky.)

1679
01:02:04,557 --> 01:02:06,726
I see. May I get one?

1680
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:09,796
What about you, K.Will? What have you given as gifts?

1681
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:10,997
He's a lover.

1682
01:02:10,997 --> 01:02:12,765
I have hands to write letters.

1683
01:02:12,765 --> 01:02:14,367
My bank account is waiting for you.

1684
01:02:14,367 --> 01:02:17,637
(I have hands to write letters. My bank account is waiting for you.)

1685
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:20,340
(They will fall for the money.)

1686
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,175
He's happy about using money.

1687
01:02:22,175 --> 01:02:23,476
Salute.

1688
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:27,347
(She salutes to K.Will's bank account.)

1689
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:30,450
What will you do if So Min showed interest in you?

1690
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:33,186
(What if So Min is being serious?)

1691
01:02:33,186 --> 01:02:34,854
Be honest. Don't joke around.

1692
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:37,657
(Will K.Will say yes to her?)

1693
01:02:37,657 --> 01:02:39,559
To be honest, she's not my style.

1694
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:43,096
(To be honest, she's not my style.)

1695
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:44,864
Goodness.

1696
01:02:44,864 --> 01:02:46,099
Salute.

1697
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:47,767
Salute.

1698
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:51,437
- You're not my type anymore either. - I know.

1699
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:54,240
- So Min is hurt. - Salute.

1700
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,608
(We're looking for somebody to accept So Min's salute.)

1701
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,077
- What about you, Ms. Kim? - Okay.

1702
01:02:58,077 --> 01:03:00,980
It probably was a long time ago,

1703
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,616
but do you remember what you got from Mr. Ha?

1704
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:06,486
- I do. I still have them. - What are they?

1705
01:03:08,554 --> 01:03:09,956
There's a variety.

1706
01:03:09,956 --> 01:03:14,427
- She's absorbed in this. - There's a handbag and...

1707
01:03:14,927 --> 01:03:17,597
- She's absorbed. - Back then,

1708
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:20,299
there was a handbag and more. Perfume...

1709
01:03:20,299 --> 01:03:21,667
and some others.

1710
01:03:21,667 --> 01:03:23,436
There's a variety, but you only mentioned the handbag.

1711
01:03:23,436 --> 01:03:25,772
(There's a variety, but you only mentioned the handbag.)

1712
01:03:26,005 --> 01:03:28,708
- It was the most memorable one. - What was the most recent gift?

1713
01:03:29,308 --> 01:03:30,777
I got some debt.

1714
01:03:30,777 --> 01:03:33,346
(That was the most recent one.)

1715
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:35,148
That's the truth.

1716
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:36,816
- Debt? - Yes, debt.

1717
01:03:36,816 --> 01:03:38,284
There must be a lot.

1718
01:03:38,284 --> 01:03:39,619
Did you get a lot?

1719
01:03:40,186 --> 01:03:41,587
Can we get 10 R Coins?

1720
01:03:41,587 --> 01:03:42,955
(We're poor.)

1721
01:03:45,258 --> 01:03:47,360
Let's go ahead with the next question.

1722
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:49,128
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1723
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:50,129
Let's go.

1724
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:51,497
Yellow.

1725
01:03:51,497 --> 01:03:54,700
You have to pick between your lover and a phone for a year.

1726
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,737
Number one, living with your phone for a year without your lover.

1727
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,807
Number two, living with your lover without your phone for a year.

1728
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:03,109
This one is tough.

1729
01:04:03,109 --> 01:04:06,446
It has to be a phone these days.

1730
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:09,315
- It has to be your lover. - Ready.

1731
01:04:09,315 --> 01:04:10,316
Set...

1732
01:04:10,316 --> 01:04:12,051
Run. Go, Jong Hyuk. Pull yourself forward.

1733
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:13,686
(This is their last chance.)

1734
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:15,788
- Push yourself forward. - Good job.

1735
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:19,459
(Gi Beom dashes forward.)

1736
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:22,728
(Gi Beom is 205cm tall, and he charges out from the corner.)

1737
01:04:23,196 --> 01:04:24,230
(He advances with his long limbs.)

1738
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:26,399
Gi Beom is fast. Gi Beom!

1739
01:04:26,766 --> 01:04:27,967
Gi Beom!

1740
01:04:27,967 --> 01:04:29,001
(Let's go, my hero.)

1741
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:33,706
(Will Gi Beom relive the glory of his heyday?)

1742
01:04:33,706 --> 01:04:35,741
Gi Beom is fast. Gi Beom!

1743
01:04:35,975 --> 01:04:38,377
(He collapses at the very end.)

1744
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:41,347
(Jae Seok takes the banana Gi Beom missed.)

1745
01:04:41,347 --> 01:04:43,916
(Who will take the banana?)

1746
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:48,788
(Jae Seok takes it with his crunched-up face.)

1747
01:04:48,788 --> 01:04:50,857
What did you do?

1748
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,725
(I ate it.)

1749
01:04:52,725 --> 01:04:54,260
Jae Seok, you first.

1750
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,029
- I almost got it. - Gi Beom!

1751
01:04:57,897 --> 01:04:59,031
He's good.

1752
01:04:59,031 --> 01:05:00,700
- This... - I had some.

1753
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:03,836
- Are you okay? - I almost had it.

1754
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:06,139
- Jae Seok. - How many points do you have?

1755
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:07,840
The banana smells like feet.

1756
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,109
(This is a shocking report.)

1757
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:12,345
(Jae Seok touched it with his hands, but it smells like feet?)

1758
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:14,547
- This is a big accident. - Goodness.

1759
01:05:14,547 --> 01:05:16,449
How can the banana smell like feet?

1760
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:18,851
- I'm serious. - Oh, gosh.

1761
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:20,486
I shouldn't have had it.

1762
01:05:20,486 --> 01:05:23,055
- Jae Seok, get it right. - If you're wrong, you lose a point.

1763
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:24,957
It has to be the phone.

1764
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:28,327
For your reference, the percentages were...

1765
01:05:28,327 --> 01:05:30,196
55.6 percent and 44.4 percent.

1766
01:05:30,196 --> 01:05:32,131
- Right? - It's close.

1767
01:05:32,131 --> 01:05:34,667
(If you had to choose between your lover and a phone for a year?)

1768
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,270
- It has to be the phone. - It's not the phone.

1769
01:05:37,436 --> 01:05:39,038
It's the first one.

1770
01:05:39,705 --> 01:05:42,341
I will probably choose...

1771
01:05:42,875 --> 01:05:44,110
Kwang Soo.

1772
01:05:46,045 --> 01:05:47,146
Kwang Soo.

1773
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:48,347
(You're Kwang Soo, right?)

1774
01:05:48,347 --> 01:05:51,150
What are you talking about? I'm here.

1775
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:52,885
- Gosh. - I thought you were Kwang Soo.

1776
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:54,086
(Gi Beom is a lookalike. Watch out.)

1777
01:05:54,086 --> 01:05:56,455
You can't live a day without a phone.

1778
01:05:56,455 --> 01:05:58,591
You can fight with your lover, but not your phone.

1779
01:05:58,591 --> 01:06:01,661
Still, you have a lover. You can't live a year just with your phone.

1780
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:03,229
Phones are good for a short while.

1781
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:05,598
I've lived a year with my phone when I didn't have a girlfriend.

1782
01:06:05,598 --> 01:06:07,066
(I did it.)

1783
01:06:07,366 --> 01:06:10,436
(I'm already doing it.)

1784
01:06:10,836 --> 01:06:12,405
- There's your testimony. - Look at him.

1785
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:14,340
- That's true. - It's not bad.

1786
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,375
- He says it's okay. - It's not bad.

1787
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:19,145
If you put it that way, I don't know what to say.

1788
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:21,347
I'm sure it's number 1, but you can choose 2.

1789
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:23,649
- I choose two. - No, Jae Seok.

1790
01:06:24,116 --> 01:06:25,117
Two.

1791
01:06:25,117 --> 01:06:26,986
- Two? - That's sharp.

1792
01:06:26,986 --> 01:06:31,157
You think people chose to live with their lovers.

1793
01:06:31,891 --> 01:06:33,226
I think so?

1794
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:35,061
(Jae Seok is correct.)

1795
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,295
He was right.

1796
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:39,065
(Lovers are better than phones.)

1797
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:41,367
- That's right. - Really?

1798
01:06:42,034 --> 01:06:44,170
(Let's go, Jae Seok.)

1799
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,205
- What was it? - That was unexpected.

1800
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:47,940
I was trying to mislead him.

1801
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,009
- He's right. - Right?

1802
01:06:50,076 --> 01:06:51,310
This is great.

1803
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,578
Okay.

1804
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:53,846
(This concludes the mission.)

1805
01:06:53,846 --> 01:06:55,448
Everybody,

1806
01:06:55,448 --> 01:06:57,617
Team Red and Blue are both in first place.

1807
01:06:57,617 --> 01:06:58,884
(They each got a question right, so they win.)

1808
01:07:00,286 --> 01:07:02,555
(But there's only one winner.)

1809
01:07:02,555 --> 01:07:03,789
We need just one team.

1810
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:04,957
Do you want to do rock-paper-scissors?

1811
01:07:04,957 --> 01:07:06,058
(They'll do rock-paper-scissors to choose the winner.)

1812
01:07:06,058 --> 01:07:08,628
- Do it when he says, "scissors". - Rock-paper-scissors

1813
01:07:09,028 --> 01:07:10,329
(Gi Beom wins.)

1814
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:12,231
- Okay. - What was that?

1815
01:07:12,231 --> 01:07:13,899
- Did I win? - Best out of three.

1816
01:07:13,899 --> 01:07:16,435
(Best out of 3.)

1817
01:07:16,435 --> 01:07:18,437
You didn't say that before.

1818
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:20,339
- You didn't say that earlier. - It's Parents' Day.

1819
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:22,174
- This is Parents' Day Special. - She wants best out of three now.

1820
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:25,378
(I guess I take after my mom.)

1821
01:07:25,678 --> 01:07:27,880
- Best out of three. - Okay, do it.

1822
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,448
You can't do just once.

1823
01:07:29,448 --> 01:07:30,916
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I'm a pastor,

1824
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:33,486
so the whole country is watching. I'm in trouble. I'll do something.

1825
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:34,820
- Rock... - Wait.

1826
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:37,490
Losing in rock-paper-scissors has nothing to do with being a pastor.

1827
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,625
It has nothing to do with it.

1828
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,527
- Okay. Rock-paper-scissors. - Don't lose.

1829
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:43,396
Rock-paper-scissors

1830
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,465
What's wrong?

1831
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:47,767
Okay!

1832
01:07:47,767 --> 01:07:49,735
(She got another try, but Team Red wins.)

1833
01:07:49,735 --> 01:07:51,871
- Best out of three. - It was the same as before.

1834
01:07:53,105 --> 01:07:56,876
(They're going for Team Green who has 80 R Coins.)

1835
01:07:57,076 --> 01:08:00,146
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo choose to steal Jong Hyuk's bag.)

1836
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:02,815
(But he has no coins.)

1837
01:08:02,815 --> 01:08:04,717
(They protected their 80 R Coins.)

1838
01:08:04,717 --> 01:08:05,785
(And the final mission followed.)

1839
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:08,187
(It was Group Jump Rope Speed Quiz.)

1840
01:08:08,287 --> 01:08:13,326
(Team Blue showed great teamwork and can choose a bag.)

1841
01:08:13,326 --> 01:08:16,996
Team Blue, please make your decision.

1842
01:08:16,996 --> 01:08:19,665
Which bag from which team would you like to choose from?

1843
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,868
This is driving me nuts. Who should it be?

1844
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:25,037
(Team Green has 80 R Coins, Blue has 70, Red has 50, Yellow has 40.)

1845
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:27,139
We only need 30 more R Coins.

1846
01:08:27,306 --> 01:08:29,175
We can choose any team.

1847
01:08:29,675 --> 01:08:32,311
Which team will be the funniest when they have no coins?

1848
01:08:32,445 --> 01:08:33,879
That's what we are thinking about.

1849
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:36,649
What did you write, Gi Beom?

1850
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:39,185
I wrote 10, 10, 10, and 20.

1851
01:08:39,185 --> 01:08:41,087
- 10, 10, 10, and 20? - 20 for Kwang Soo?

1852
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,556
(20 for Kwang Soo?)

1853
01:08:46,525 --> 01:08:48,327
- There's not enough. - I'll be honest.

1854
01:08:48,327 --> 01:08:50,296
(When they were distributing Running Money)

1855
01:08:50,296 --> 01:08:53,666
(They gave 40 R Coins to Kwang Soo.)

1856
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,534
40 for me, 10 for him.

1857
01:08:57,136 --> 01:08:58,838
- 10, 10, 10, and 20? - 20 for Kwang Soo?

1858
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:00,106
Yes.

1859
01:09:00,906 --> 01:09:02,341
- Hey. - Hold on.

1860
01:09:02,341 --> 01:09:03,576
It's a trick.

1861
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:05,978
Don't trust him. He's incredible.

1862
01:09:06,045 --> 01:09:07,847
So it's 20 for Kwang Soo?

1863
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,148
I pick Kwang Soo.

1864
01:09:09,148 --> 01:09:10,516
- Wait. - That's what he said.

1865
01:09:10,516 --> 01:09:12,351
- Listen to me. - That's not it.

1866
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:14,920
- That's what he said. - I know.

1867
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,157
(Hello?)

1868
01:09:18,157 --> 01:09:19,859
He was just joking.

1869
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:21,327
Think about it again.

1870
01:09:21,327 --> 01:09:23,129
(Let's take it easy.)

1871
01:09:23,129 --> 01:09:24,630
- What do you want me to do? - Just...

1872
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,298
- give us another chance. - What did you do?

1873
01:09:26,298 --> 01:09:27,666
This is your last chance.

1874
01:09:27,666 --> 01:09:29,268
- Be honest. - You can tell the truth.

1875
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:31,070
- Tell the truth. - The truth?

1876
01:09:31,237 --> 01:09:33,706
It's not 10, 10, and 10.

1877
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:36,475
- We gave it to one person. - That's Kwang Soo.

1878
01:09:36,475 --> 01:09:39,578
(That's Kwang Soo.)

1879
01:09:39,578 --> 01:09:41,247
One more chance.

1880
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,848
- I'll talk to him again. - Why?

1881
01:09:42,848 --> 01:09:44,550
- I have to explain. - I'm certain.

1882
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:46,485
You can do whatever you want.

1883
01:09:46,485 --> 01:09:47,720
Okay.

1884
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,288
- He's blushing. - No.

1885
01:09:49,288 --> 01:09:50,856
(He's blushing. It must be right.)

1886
01:09:50,856 --> 01:09:53,125
- I'm blushing? - You are.

1887
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:55,561
(I'm blushing?)

1888
01:09:55,561 --> 01:09:56,629
(His face is obviously red.)

1889
01:09:56,629 --> 01:09:59,098
- Hold on. - He's blushing.

1890
01:09:59,098 --> 01:10:00,866
Don't anger him.

1891
01:10:00,866 --> 01:10:04,336
- He's angry now. - Hold on.

1892
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,338
There will be an unexpected twist.

1893
01:10:06,505 --> 01:10:08,507
Let's go with Kwang Soo.

1894
01:10:08,507 --> 01:10:09,675
I think it'll be funny.

1895
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:11,777
(Team Blue's instinct is to go for Kwang Soo.)

1896
01:10:11,777 --> 01:10:13,245
- In 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

1897
01:10:13,245 --> 01:10:14,246
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1898
01:10:14,246 --> 01:10:15,414
(Kwang Soo, we choose you.)

1899
01:10:15,414 --> 01:10:17,416
Let's open Kwang Soo's bag and check.

1900
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,751
(Team Blue chooses Kwang Soo's.)

1901
01:10:18,751 --> 01:10:20,119
What is it?

1902
01:10:20,286 --> 01:10:21,987
Why is there an envelope?

1903
01:10:22,054 --> 01:10:24,490
Are you going to open it? Wait.

1904
01:10:25,691 --> 01:10:27,927
- Look. - 40 R Coins?

1905
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:30,896
(Team Blue gets 40 R Coins.)

1906
01:10:30,896 --> 01:10:34,366
(We can wear suits now.)

1907
01:10:34,366 --> 01:10:36,836
(Team Red is poor, and Team Blue is in 1st place.)

1908
01:10:36,836 --> 01:10:39,705
- We were right. - This is insane.

1909
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:42,374
- It was 40? - Gi Beom.

1910
01:10:42,374 --> 01:10:44,577
He was right.

1911
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:46,846
- He was right. - What do we wear?

1912
01:10:46,846 --> 01:10:48,280
This is the final round.

1913
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,416
This is an important time for TV Rating Notice.

1914
01:10:50,416 --> 01:10:52,518
- It's Loyal Shopping Time. - What's this?

1915
01:10:52,518 --> 01:10:54,620
(Final round: Loyal Shopping Time)

1916
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,288
Loyal Shopping Time?

1917
01:10:56,455 --> 01:10:59,558
Starting from the team with the most coins, go into the shop.

1918
01:10:59,558 --> 01:11:02,328
You can each pick an outfit with the coins you have.

1919
01:11:02,328 --> 01:11:04,029
(R Coins must be divided within the team to be spent.)

1920
01:11:04,029 --> 01:11:06,365
If an outfit is purchased by another team, it's out of stock.

1921
01:11:06,365 --> 01:11:08,200
(If another team purchases an outfit, it gets out of stock.)

1922
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:10,836
- We have to share the coins? - We do.

1923
01:11:10,836 --> 01:11:12,338
- This is not the end. - This team...

1924
01:11:12,338 --> 01:11:14,640
- has 10 R Coins. - They have to wear the tights.

1925
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,109
- 1 person will be fine. - You can buy 1 outfit.

1926
01:11:17,109 --> 01:11:18,677
Only one person survives.

1927
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:23,516
(Only one person can avoid the tights?)

1928
01:11:24,116 --> 01:11:25,551
(Current R Coin Distribution)

1929
01:11:25,551 --> 01:11:27,186
(Team Blue is in 1st place, Green in 2nd,)

1930
01:11:27,186 --> 01:11:28,387
(Yellow in 3rd, and Red in last place)

1931
01:11:28,387 --> 01:11:30,956
Team Blue has the most coins,

1932
01:11:30,956 --> 01:11:33,325
so you can choose who gets to go first.

1933
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:36,195
The spoon with a sticker on it goes first.

1934
01:11:36,629 --> 01:11:37,897
Which one should I choose?

1935
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:40,799
(Which pair will get to go first?)

1936
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,535
- Is this normal? - You get to go first.

1937
01:11:42,535 --> 01:11:45,638
(Haha and Ok Jeong get to go first.)

1938
01:11:45,638 --> 01:11:47,740
Red sticker goes first.

1939
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:49,108
You first.

1940
01:11:49,108 --> 01:11:51,076
- You picked a good one. - Really?

1941
01:11:51,076 --> 01:11:52,545
- You can go first. - Okay.

1942
01:11:52,545 --> 01:11:55,047
I believe you'll leave us 100 R Coins.

1943
01:11:55,047 --> 01:11:56,715
You are going to wear suits.

1944
01:11:56,715 --> 01:11:58,317
- That's right. - I want suits too.

1945
01:11:58,317 --> 01:11:59,885
Go ahead. Please be nice.

1946
01:11:59,885 --> 01:12:01,287
- Sure. - Please be nice.

1947
01:12:01,287 --> 01:12:03,088
(Haha and Ok Jeong will get suits. What will they buy?)

1948
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:04,657
There they are.

1949
01:12:05,057 --> 01:12:06,325
Hold on.

1950
01:12:06,325 --> 01:12:08,794
(As soon as he comes in)

1951
01:12:08,794 --> 01:12:10,496
Whose name...

1952
01:12:10,596 --> 01:12:12,097
is Name Super under right now?

1953
01:12:12,097 --> 01:12:15,067
If I don't buy that, it's just Running Man. If I buy it,

1954
01:12:16,468 --> 01:12:18,938
is it Haha's Running Man?

1955
01:12:18,938 --> 01:12:21,140
(It's tempting.)

1956
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,676
Jae Seok and Ji Suk can take it.

1957
01:12:23,676 --> 01:12:26,345
We'll just go.

1958
01:12:26,478 --> 01:12:27,746
- What do you think? - Oh, gosh.

1959
01:12:27,746 --> 01:12:29,515
(Will he take the honor of Name Super...)

1960
01:12:29,515 --> 01:12:31,317
(or be loyal and take the suit?)

1961
01:12:31,317 --> 01:12:34,687
This is driving me nuts.

1962
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:37,489
(If they don't get Name Super, they can leave 110 R Coins.)

1963
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:38,891
What should we do?

1964
01:12:39,558 --> 01:12:41,060
They're back.

1965
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,696
We trust you two.

1966
01:12:43,696 --> 01:12:45,030
- Yes. - Goodness.

1967
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,566
My mom is too soft-hearted.

1968
01:12:47,566 --> 01:12:48,867
- I'm too soft-hearted. - I know.

1969
01:12:48,867 --> 01:12:51,770
- You can go in. - I trust your mother.

1970
01:12:52,705 --> 01:12:54,106
No way.

1971
01:12:54,106 --> 01:12:55,240
(Did Haha and Ok Jeong choose Name Super?)

1972
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,375
No way.

1973
01:12:56,375 --> 01:13:01,347
(Or did they leave some coins for Jae Seok and Ji Suk?)

1974
01:13:01,347 --> 01:13:05,351
All right. Haha and Ok Jeong...

1975
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:07,987
- said they didn't need much. - Right.

1976
01:13:07,987 --> 01:13:10,255
There are 10 R Coins left.

1977
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:12,958
(There are 10 R Coins left.)

1978
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:18,130
(What? 10 R Coins?)

1979
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:19,498
They left 10 R Coins?

1980
01:13:19,498 --> 01:13:21,567
They purchased Name Super.

1981
01:13:22,835 --> 01:13:25,638
(Haha backstabbed us.)

1982
01:13:25,671 --> 01:13:28,440
- This is our chance, Mom. - Really? That's right.

1983
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:30,709
If you have the will, you can try it.

1984
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:33,045
I saw you play the games today,

1985
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:35,080
- and I take after you. - Really?

1986
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,417
(They can't hide the selfish trait.)

1987
01:13:38,651 --> 01:13:39,985
This is too...

1988
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:41,687
(Haha and Ok Jeong chose Name Super.)

1989
01:13:41,687 --> 01:13:42,955
- Ok Jeong is too... - They took it.

1990
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:44,690
They were being too greedy.

1991
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:46,625
You can choose from the remaining outfits.

1992
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,327
(They got 100 R Coins taken away, so they only have 10 left.)

1993
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:50,796
(They're all around the same.)

1994
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:53,966
From these 3, eliminate 1.

1995
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:55,067
Let's go with this one.

1996
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:56,535
(This won't do.)

1997
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:00,105
(Jae Seok chooses...)

1998
01:14:00,105 --> 01:14:02,608
(a Barrel Man?)

1999
01:14:03,409 --> 01:14:05,778
(It's a great choice.)

2000
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:07,479
(Barrel Man was flexible and a great dancer.)

2001
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:10,516
I'm sorry. We have to do this.

2002
01:14:10,716 --> 01:14:12,785
- I'm an actor. - It's okay.

2003
01:14:12,785 --> 01:14:14,687
These are all the same.

2004
01:14:14,687 --> 01:14:16,889
It's been a while since I've been casted for a drama.

2005
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:19,458
It's okay. If you do this, you'll get some calls.

2006
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:20,826
If you do this, they'll call you.

2007
01:14:20,826 --> 01:14:21,927
(They'll call me if I do this?)

2008
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:22,928
Don't worry.

2009
01:14:22,928 --> 01:14:25,030
- No... - Let's go.

2010
01:14:25,497 --> 01:14:26,665
Is this okay?

2011
01:14:26,665 --> 01:14:29,001
(Jae Seok and Ji Suk choose Barrel Man.)

2012
01:14:29,234 --> 01:14:31,336
It's red. It's Barrel Man.

2013
01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:32,805
It's Barrel Man.

2014
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:35,407
It was my mom's choice.

2015
01:14:35,407 --> 01:14:36,608
That's not the problem.

2016
01:14:36,608 --> 01:14:39,945
She really wanted to see Haha's Running Man.

2017
01:14:39,945 --> 01:14:41,547
So my son...

2018
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:44,516
For four weeks, it'll be Haha's Running Man.

2019
01:14:44,516 --> 01:14:47,186
(Haha's Running Man for 4 weeks)

2020
01:14:47,186 --> 01:14:49,054
Really?

2021
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:51,156
Who wouldn't pick this?

2022
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:54,059
What's the whole point of dressing them in suits?

2023
01:14:54,727 --> 01:14:56,595
- I feel bad. - It's okay.

2024
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,897
- You can choose. - It's us.

2025
01:14:59,064 --> 01:15:00,365
- Jong Kook, go ahead. - It's us.

2026
01:15:00,365 --> 01:15:02,267
- It's our team. - Pick one.

2027
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:03,669
In 1, 2, 3.

2028
01:15:03,969 --> 01:15:05,037
(Jong Kook and K.Will get to go first.)

2029
01:15:05,037 --> 01:15:07,206
Yes.

2030
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:09,875
- This is important. - If we're going to do this,

2031
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:11,076
I think Joker is better.

2032
01:15:11,076 --> 01:15:13,045
Frog is cute though, right?

2033
01:15:13,445 --> 01:15:14,980
Are you going to paint our faces as frogs?

2034
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:17,249
- Will it be green? - Just a little bit.

2035
01:15:17,249 --> 01:15:18,917
- It's not too much? - No.

2036
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:21,286
- It won't be too much. - These are tights.

2037
01:15:21,286 --> 01:15:23,856
- This one's cute. - Okay, let's do this.

2038
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:26,358
We'll choose Boy Frog.

2039
01:15:26,358 --> 01:15:27,526
(We choose you, Boy Frog.)

2040
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,761
Let's go.

2041
01:15:28,761 --> 01:15:30,529
Do you want to try this first?

2042
01:15:30,529 --> 01:15:32,498
You'll look cute anyhow.

2043
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:34,099
It's cute for anybody.

2044
01:15:34,099 --> 01:15:36,235
(Really?)

2045
01:15:36,235 --> 01:15:37,636
This is cute for anybody.

2046
01:15:37,936 --> 01:15:42,474
(Boy Frog is a cute character that represents dream and hope.)

2047
01:15:42,474 --> 01:15:43,709
This is cute for anybody.

2048
01:15:43,709 --> 01:15:47,846
(It's a killer smile.)

2049
01:15:47,846 --> 01:15:50,916
- I'm so scared. - I'm cute.

2050
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,017
(I'm just scared.)

2051
01:15:52,017 --> 01:15:53,919
- I'm scared. - I'm cute.

2052
01:15:53,919 --> 01:15:55,788
Shall we go? I'm cute.

2053
01:15:55,788 --> 01:15:59,424
(Jong Kook and K.Will choose Boy Frog.)

2054
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:00,926
Let's choose this one.

2055
01:16:00,926 --> 01:16:02,127
- Annabelle? - Yes.

2056
01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:04,296
It'll be funny for female members to choose that.

2057
01:16:04,296 --> 01:16:06,465
Is this okay? The skirt too?

2058
01:16:06,465 --> 01:16:07,499
I like the color.

2059
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:09,535
(He likes it.)

2060
01:16:09,535 --> 01:16:12,237
You don't care anymore. That's good.

2061
01:16:12,237 --> 01:16:14,006
This one. It's cuter.

2062
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:15,908
It's cuter.

2063
01:16:15,908 --> 01:16:17,075
(They choose Toshio that Haha dressed up as with 10 R Coins.)

2064
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:19,378
Toshio.

2065
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:22,247
(Ji Hyo and Seong Moon choose Joker.)

2066
01:16:22,247 --> 01:16:24,116
Let's go.

2067
01:16:25,217 --> 01:16:26,318
We'll be back.

2068
01:16:26,318 --> 01:16:28,387
(The costumes will be revealed soon.)

2069
01:16:28,387 --> 01:16:30,355
Do rock-paper-scissors.

2070
01:16:30,589 --> 01:16:33,025
- Only 1 person gets to go. - Only 1 person.

2071
01:16:33,025 --> 01:16:34,626
- One pair? - You have to win.

2072
01:16:34,626 --> 01:16:35,627
Rock-paper-scissors.

2073
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:37,196
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

2074
01:16:39,665 --> 01:16:43,335
(Seok Jin and Woo Jong win.)

2075
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:44,870
They get to wear tights.

2076
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:47,206
We at least get to choose.

2077
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:48,807
(They can get Kaonashi.)

2078
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:51,910
We have to wear tights.

2079
01:16:52,878 --> 01:16:55,147
I tried so hard to avoid it.

2080
01:16:55,147 --> 01:16:56,715
We did the dirty work for other people.

2081
01:16:56,949 --> 01:17:00,285
- Gi Beom, you're... - He looks upset.

2082
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,687
He's penniless.

2083
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:05,190
(It's time to transform.)

2084
01:17:07,526 --> 01:17:09,294
This is really bad.

2085
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:10,495
(Complaining)

2086
01:17:10,996 --> 01:17:12,297
(Exclaiming)

2087
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:13,665
That's new.

2088
01:17:13,665 --> 01:17:16,034
(That's new.)

2089
01:17:17,236 --> 01:17:18,670
- It's a new character. - It's okay.

2090
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,105
(Welcome to Barrel Man.)

2091
01:17:21,406 --> 01:17:23,208
(You look so funny, Ji Suk.)

2092
01:17:24,776 --> 01:17:26,044
Oh, dear.

2093
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:29,214
Jong Kook, you look so scary from the back.

2094
01:17:29,214 --> 01:17:30,515
(She's shocked.)

2095
01:17:31,216 --> 01:17:33,085
- You look so scary. - He's more scary from the front.

2096
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:34,486
(The backside is better.)

2097
01:17:34,486 --> 01:17:37,756
He's almost like a toad. He's not a frog.

2098
01:17:37,956 --> 01:17:40,225
He's a bullfrog.

2099
01:17:40,325 --> 01:17:41,727
I'm Ranatan.

2100
01:17:41,727 --> 01:17:43,028
(Don't you see my skirt?)

2101
01:17:43,996 --> 01:17:48,600
(What happened to Ranatan?)

2102
01:17:49,434 --> 01:17:52,037
- He's so scary. - He is, right?

2103
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:53,305
He's a frog.

2104
01:17:53,305 --> 01:17:56,675
(If you touch my pond, I'll punish you.)

2105
01:17:57,676 --> 01:17:58,977
How many weeks will this be for?

2106
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:00,345
- For a month. - Oh, dear.

2107
01:18:00,345 --> 01:18:03,115
(I'll be Boy Frog for 4 weeks.)

2108
01:18:03,115 --> 01:18:04,816
- Look at him. - It's a dolphin.

2109
01:18:04,816 --> 01:18:06,385
Gosh, Gi Beom.

2110
01:18:06,685 --> 01:18:08,020
Gi Beom.

2111
01:18:08,487 --> 01:18:09,888
Please stop.

2112
01:18:09,888 --> 01:18:11,556
- This is legendary. - Please stop.

2113
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,058
Please stop this.

2114
01:18:13,058 --> 01:18:14,359
I'm sorry.

2115
01:18:14,359 --> 01:18:16,194
(He turned from a basketball legend to a variety show legend.)

2116
01:18:16,194 --> 01:18:18,130
He's my hero.

2117
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,298
I'm sorry.

2118
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:20,499
(He gets up.)

2119
01:18:22,734 --> 01:18:25,570
(He's let loose.)

2120
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:26,705
Don't get close!

2121
01:18:26,705 --> 01:18:27,806
(He's scary.)

2122
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:29,508
Don't get close!

2123
01:18:29,508 --> 01:18:30,909
Don't get close.

2124
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:34,947
(He's as charismatic as he was on the basketball court in 1989.)

2125
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:38,317
He's so tall.

2126
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:39,584
Look at Kwang Soo.

2127
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:42,688
(Joker Ji Hyo)

2128
01:18:44,656 --> 01:18:47,926
(Seong Moon is transforming into Joker too.)

2129
01:18:49,227 --> 01:18:51,596
- You look charismatic. - On Halloween,

2130
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:54,099
- people would do that. - You'll be popular...

2131
01:18:54,099 --> 01:18:56,335
- if you do this on Halloween. - It'll be nice.

2132
01:19:00,038 --> 01:19:02,774
(What did I just see?)

2133
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:05,844
- You're scary. - You look so scary.

2134
01:19:05,844 --> 01:19:06,945
(Watching him walk gives them chills.)

2135
01:19:06,945 --> 01:19:08,747
It's supposed to be cute.

2136
01:19:09,047 --> 01:19:10,949
It was cute when Haha did it.

2137
01:19:10,949 --> 01:19:12,517
(Toshio is in puberty now.)

2138
01:19:12,517 --> 01:19:13,885
- You scared me. - Oh, dear.

2139
01:19:13,885 --> 01:19:15,620
(Here's another Toshio.)

2140
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,155
- It's the female version. - What?

2141
01:19:17,456 --> 01:19:19,925
Do I look scary? I look scary?

2142
01:19:20,826 --> 01:19:22,127
Why?

2143
01:19:22,894 --> 01:19:24,229
(Goodness)

2144
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:25,230
I look so scary.

2145
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:26,565
(She finally sees herself.)

2146
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:28,467
You look more scary.

2147
01:19:28,467 --> 01:19:30,369
(You're scarier than me.)

2148
01:19:32,404 --> 01:19:35,307
How pretty! My goodness, Jong Hyuk.

2149
01:19:35,407 --> 01:19:37,776
Jong Hyuk looks so cute. I don't know what to do.

2150
01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:39,211
He looks so cute.

2151
01:19:40,345 --> 01:19:44,416
He looks like a cute and ugly doll.

2152
01:19:45,917 --> 01:19:47,319
Hello.

2153
01:19:48,086 --> 01:19:49,087
It's nice to meet you.

2154
01:19:49,087 --> 01:19:50,389
(It's nice to meet you, Seok Jin Kaonashi.)

2155
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:53,425
(Do I look like I am in the mood for pleasantries?)

2156
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,994
Was this the best choice?

2157
01:19:55,994 --> 01:19:57,829
- What? - Was this the best choice?

2158
01:19:58,096 --> 01:19:59,598
Look next to you.

2159
01:20:04,836 --> 01:20:06,405
It's better.

2160
01:20:06,405 --> 01:20:08,440
- At least we look human. - I know.

2161
01:20:08,607 --> 01:20:10,809
(Seok Jin gets attacked.)

2162
01:20:12,577 --> 01:20:14,980
(The winners, Haha and Ok Jeong)

2163
01:20:15,647 --> 01:20:17,916
(Barrel men, Jae Seok and Ji Suk)

2164
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:20,485
(Gang Boy Frog and Ranatan, Jong Kook and K.Will)

2165
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:23,088
(Kaonashis, Seok Jin and Woo Jong)

2166
01:20:23,555 --> 01:20:25,757
(Joker siblings, Ji Hyo and Seong Moon)

2167
01:20:26,124 --> 01:20:28,427
(Grown-up Annabelles, Se Chan and Jong Hyuk)

2168
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:30,996
(Toshio siblings, So Min and Min Gwan)

2169
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:35,467
(White towers in tights, Kwang Soo and Gi Beom)

2170
01:20:36,334 --> 01:20:38,570
(The shoot for the TV rating notice finally begins.)

2171
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:40,539
(Gathering around)

2172
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,175
(They are colorful.)

2173
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:45,077
How should we do this?

2174
01:20:45,177 --> 01:20:49,347
Every one of them feels like my child.

2175
01:20:49,748 --> 01:20:51,349
I am so proud of myself.

2176
01:20:51,349 --> 01:20:54,386
The members and I can handle this,

2177
01:20:54,386 --> 01:20:57,155
but it's too much for the guests.

2178
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:59,758
Jong Hyuk let go of himself.

2179
01:20:59,758 --> 01:21:02,160
I feel bad.

2180
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:05,497
Jong Hyuk asked why we invited him for this.

2181
01:21:05,497 --> 01:21:07,966
Seong Moon and Ji Hyo look cool.

2182
01:21:07,966 --> 01:21:09,634
They look charismatic.

2183
01:21:09,634 --> 01:21:10,669
- I know. - It's hard to tell...

2184
01:21:10,669 --> 01:21:12,070
the two of us apart, right?

2185
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,638
- The two of you look the same. - You resemble each other a lot.

2186
01:21:13,638 --> 01:21:15,207
K.Will looks like Cho Sae Ho.

2187
01:21:15,207 --> 01:21:17,275
- Excuse me? - Doesn't he look like Sae Ho?

2188
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:20,278
He resembles Sae Ho. He really looks like Sae Ho.

2189
01:21:20,278 --> 01:21:22,047
(Honey, your face looks awful today.)

2190
01:21:22,047 --> 01:21:25,717
Firstly, I think those in tights...

2191
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:28,587
will fill the screen.

2192
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:30,088
Let's decide on our positions.

2193
01:21:30,088 --> 01:21:31,490
- Excuse me. - Hold on.

2194
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:33,125
- Barrel Man. - Please move aside.

2195
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,759
- Barrel Man. - Step back.

2196
01:21:34,759 --> 01:21:37,496
Kaonashis and Toshios...

2197
01:21:37,829 --> 01:21:40,365
should stand over here.

2198
01:21:40,365 --> 01:21:42,367
- Give us a nice spot. - We won't be seen.

2199
01:21:42,367 --> 01:21:44,536
It's not like that. You will be in the center.

2200
01:21:44,536 --> 01:21:46,004
- Why? - Stand over here.

2201
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:48,240
Director Ha, where should the Annabelles go?

2202
01:21:48,406 --> 01:21:51,276
I think Annabelles should lie on their stomachs.

2203
01:21:51,276 --> 01:21:53,745
(I am sorry.)

2204
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:54,980
- Lie on our stomachs? - Yes.

2205
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:57,549
Jong Hyuk's expression tells me I shouldn't do that.

2206
01:21:57,616 --> 01:21:59,985
- I will think about it. - Annabelles...

2207
01:21:59,985 --> 01:22:01,386
- should sit in chairs. - We should sit in chairs.

2208
01:22:01,386 --> 01:22:03,488
Please give us two chairs.

2209
01:22:03,855 --> 01:22:05,657
Annabelles need to sit down.

2210
01:22:05,657 --> 01:22:07,726
- At least we will sit down. - I know.

2211
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:09,427
- Annabelles, sit down. - Will they sit at the front?

2212
01:22:09,427 --> 01:22:11,329
- We need to sit at the front. - Should we sit together?

2213
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:13,765
- Yes. - Please sit down.

2214
01:22:14,366 --> 01:22:17,369
As for Barrel Men,

2215
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:20,105
please pass by as you dance when I say the line.

2216
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:21,840
- Do you want us to pass by? - Yes.

2217
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,375
You can exit that way.

2218
01:22:23,375 --> 01:22:25,810
- That's... - Pass by as you dance.

2219
01:22:26,178 --> 01:22:28,880
- Do what he says! - It will look nice.

2220
01:22:29,414 --> 01:22:31,316
(Let's finish up quickly and go home.)

2221
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:34,719
Now... How cute.

2222
01:22:35,287 --> 01:22:37,689
- What? - You look cute.

2223
01:22:38,156 --> 01:22:39,925
- Stand over here. - Ranatan looks cute.

2224
01:22:39,925 --> 01:22:41,526
- What? - I think Ranatan looks scary.

2225
01:22:41,526 --> 01:22:44,796
You will look cute if you stand over here.

2226
01:22:44,796 --> 01:22:45,797
All right.

2227
01:22:45,797 --> 01:22:49,067
- Toshios and Kaonashis... - They should stick together.

2228
01:22:49,067 --> 01:22:50,936
should stay together.

2229
01:22:50,936 --> 01:22:53,405
The arrangement is perfect.

2230
01:22:54,806 --> 01:22:56,474
What should we do?

2231
01:22:56,975 --> 01:22:58,977
You are men in tights.

2232
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:01,780
I will have to see how everything looks on the screen.

2233
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,448
Aren't we too far in the back?

2234
01:23:03,648 --> 01:23:05,016
That position is perfect.

2235
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:06,184
(Stay there.)

2236
01:23:06,184 --> 01:23:07,185
(Sad)

2237
01:23:07,185 --> 01:23:11,089
Since I feel bad, I will give you a part of the line.

2238
01:23:11,089 --> 01:23:12,424
I will give you "rated".

2239
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:13,425
(It's a shocking offer.)

2240
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:14,926
- The two of us? - Yes.

2241
01:23:14,926 --> 01:23:16,995
- Thank you. - That's a generous offer.

2242
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:20,599
Yes, I will give you that. Mom, you and I will enter...

2243
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:22,467
and say,

2244
01:23:23,034 --> 01:23:25,470
- "Running Man is..." - "Rated..."

2245
01:23:26,037 --> 01:23:27,505
- Say, "12". - Do we get to say that?

2246
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:28,907
- "12..." - "12..."

2247
01:23:28,907 --> 01:23:32,744
This group gets "years". These two groups get "and".

2248
01:23:32,978 --> 01:23:35,647
- Will the 4 of us get "and"? - There are 4 of us!

2249
01:23:35,647 --> 01:23:37,215
- The 4 of you get "and". - Since there are 4 of us,

2250
01:23:37,215 --> 01:23:38,717
you should at least give us two words.

2251
01:23:38,717 --> 01:23:39,985
This is too much.

2252
01:23:39,985 --> 01:23:41,086
At least give us two words.

2253
01:23:41,086 --> 01:23:43,288
Some of us don't even get to show our faces.

2254
01:23:43,288 --> 01:23:45,056
Give us "years and".

2255
01:23:45,056 --> 01:23:48,426
We were here since the morning. At least give us two words.

2256
01:23:48,526 --> 01:23:51,196
- Give us "years and". - Gosh, I am so soft-hearted.

2257
01:23:51,896 --> 01:23:53,765
- Give us "years and". - Okay, you get "years and".

2258
01:23:53,765 --> 01:23:55,267
(I feel generous.)

2259
01:23:55,267 --> 01:23:57,168
- "Years and". - "Years and".

2260
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:58,236
You get "old" and you get "er".

2261
01:23:58,236 --> 01:23:59,604
(Jokers get "old" and the frogs get "er".)

2262
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:01,139
- "Er"? - "Older".

2263
01:24:01,606 --> 01:24:03,475
- "Er"? - After that,

2264
01:24:03,475 --> 01:24:05,577
- you will play your flute. - My flute.

2265
01:24:06,478 --> 01:24:07,779
Can you do that?

2266
01:24:07,879 --> 01:24:09,914
I can play that song.

2267
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:12,717
- It will be a full shot anyway. - You're right.

2268
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:14,686
Mom, let's go.

2269
01:24:14,786 --> 01:24:16,054
- "Running Man is..." - "Running Man is..."

2270
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:17,055
- "Rated..." - "Rated..."

2271
01:24:17,055 --> 01:24:18,056
- "12..." - "12..."

2272
01:24:18,056 --> 01:24:19,924
- "Years and..." - What do Barrel Men do?

2273
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:21,526
(What do Barrel Men do?)

2274
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:23,895
- They get to pass by. - They get to pass by.

2275
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:25,497
(Barrel Men get to pass by.)

2276
01:24:25,497 --> 01:24:26,998
- They get to pass by. - They get to pass by.

2277
01:24:26,998 --> 01:24:28,266
We should still get to say something.

2278
01:24:28,266 --> 01:24:31,269
- Just pass by. - You have the action.

2279
01:24:31,269 --> 01:24:33,004
- Be satisfied with it. - You have the action.

2280
01:24:33,004 --> 01:24:35,640
- What is it? - Ji Suk is an actor...

2281
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,375
who is in dramas.

2282
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:39,477
Everyone is in dramas.

2283
01:24:39,477 --> 01:24:40,979
- Give us something to say. - In that case,

2284
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:43,848
- we will pass by. - We will pass by.

2285
01:24:43,848 --> 01:24:46,618
If you won't show our faces, use two cotton swabs instead.

2286
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:49,854
(He is unsatisfied.)

2287
01:24:49,854 --> 01:24:52,490
(Find the difference.)

2288
01:24:53,124 --> 01:24:54,426
In that case,

2289
01:24:54,426 --> 01:24:56,094
- I can do this. - Really?

2290
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:58,830
- Give me some time. - How much time do we have?

2291
01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:00,365
- I can do this. - Five seconds.

2292
01:25:00,365 --> 01:25:01,866
Can you do it in five seconds?

2293
01:25:01,866 --> 01:25:03,068
(He is fascinated.)

2294
01:25:03,435 --> 01:25:04,669
Will you give him five seconds?

2295
01:25:04,669 --> 01:25:06,304
(The rating notice itself is 5 seconds long.)

2296
01:25:07,138 --> 01:25:08,406
(If he can do it in 5 seconds, he may be the main character.)

2297
01:25:08,406 --> 01:25:11,910
Let's try it. Get ready and go.

2298
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:13,778
(Struggling)

2299
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:15,046
He failed.

2300
01:25:15,447 --> 01:25:18,249
(Until when should I do the shoulder dance?)

2301
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:19,918
What are you doing?

2302
01:25:20,485 --> 01:25:21,720
- This is driving me crazy. - He failed.

2303
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:23,088
- What are you doing? - I wanted to do it in five seconds.

2304
01:25:23,088 --> 01:25:26,024
Don't try to get the spotlight. That's selfish.

2305
01:25:26,224 --> 01:25:28,960
- That's selfish. - Everyone is working hard.

2306
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,795
Ji Suk is working hard.

2307
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,264
Don't do that.

2308
01:25:33,264 --> 01:25:34,966
- It will hurt. - Don't do that.

2309
01:25:34,966 --> 01:25:36,968
- Just dance. - Okay.

2310
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:38,870
- Don't ask for more. - Okay.

2311
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:40,905
Mom and I need to find our positions.

2312
01:25:40,905 --> 01:25:43,475
- I found my position. - Excuse me.

2313
01:25:43,475 --> 01:25:45,677
- Excuse me, Haha. - A bit higher.

2314
01:25:45,677 --> 01:25:47,045
- Haha. - Yes?

2315
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:49,414
I am not the type to work under someone.

2316
01:25:49,614 --> 01:25:51,149
Then you should have won.

2317
01:25:51,549 --> 01:25:54,486
You should tell Jae Seok...

2318
01:25:54,486 --> 01:25:55,987
- to move around. - Mom,

2319
01:25:55,987 --> 01:26:00,125
- stop being nice to Jae Seok only. - I mean...

2320
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,226
(I doubt you will ever see him again.)

2321
01:26:01,226 --> 01:26:03,328
- You are showing your favoritism. - It's okay.

2322
01:26:03,328 --> 01:26:06,364
- He was supposed to pass by. - This is enough.

2323
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:08,500
Let's finish this quickly.

2324
01:26:08,867 --> 01:26:10,268
Everyone is working hard.

2325
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:11,469
All right. Let's go.

2326
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:12,604
(It's finally time for the first take.)

2327
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:13,805
All right.

2328
01:26:14,506 --> 01:26:15,707
Cue.

2329
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:18,109
- Running Man is... - Running Man is...

2330
01:26:18,109 --> 01:26:19,144
- Rated... - Rated...

2331
01:26:19,144 --> 01:26:20,145
- 12... - 12...

2332
01:26:20,145 --> 01:26:21,279
- Years and... - Years and...

2333
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:23,248
- Older. - Older.

2334
01:26:23,248 --> 01:26:27,585
I love Yu Jae Seok!

2335
01:26:28,787 --> 01:26:30,889
- What was that? - Don't do that.

2336
01:26:30,955 --> 01:26:33,024
What is wrong with him? Anyone can do that.

2337
01:26:33,024 --> 01:26:35,427
It's not like we don't know how to do that.

2338
01:26:35,427 --> 01:26:36,895
Can't we improvise?

2339
01:26:36,895 --> 01:26:39,197
- We made a promise. - Are you drunk?

2340
01:26:39,197 --> 01:26:41,466
- Is that why your nose is red? - Jong Kook.

2341
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:44,536
If Jae Seok improvises again...

2342
01:26:44,536 --> 01:26:47,005
- I will hit him if he does that. - Okay.

2343
01:26:47,005 --> 01:26:49,474
(Don't worry.)

2344
01:26:49,874 --> 01:26:52,010
- Hit him right away. - Okay.

2345
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:56,448
Also, move that tennis racket to the side.

2346
01:26:56,448 --> 01:26:58,716
(Excuse me, middle-aged man.)

2347
01:26:58,716 --> 01:27:00,985
- It's distracting. - For goodness' sake.

2348
01:27:01,686 --> 01:27:07,225
Yours isn't like that.

2349
01:27:07,225 --> 01:27:09,694
(Running Man is rated 12 years and older.)

2350
01:27:09,694 --> 01:27:12,397
What do you think you are doing?

2351
01:27:12,464 --> 01:27:14,766
Don't put it like that.

2352
01:27:14,966 --> 01:27:16,768
He wants his to be like that.

2353
01:27:16,768 --> 01:27:18,937
My mom laughed loudly for the first time.

2354
01:27:20,338 --> 01:27:23,575
- Did you laugh? - It was very funny.

2355
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:26,177
Say your allotted parts. Let's go after the count of three.

2356
01:27:26,177 --> 01:27:28,346
- Your dance skills are improving. - Thanks.

2357
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:30,715
You are doing a good job.

2358
01:27:31,416 --> 01:27:32,684
Cue.

2359
01:27:33,084 --> 01:27:34,586
- Running Man is... - Running Man is...

2360
01:27:34,586 --> 01:27:35,620
- Rated... - Rated...

2361
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,754
- 12... - 12...

2362
01:27:36,754 --> 01:27:38,456
- Years and years and years and... - Years and years and years and...

2363
01:27:38,456 --> 01:27:41,226
(Years and years and years and)

2364
01:27:41,226 --> 01:27:42,927
(They remix their part.)

2365
01:27:42,927 --> 01:27:44,496
We wanted to do it once.

2366
01:27:44,496 --> 01:27:46,698
- What was that? - Cut us some slack.

2367
01:27:46,698 --> 01:27:48,266
- Come on. - There are four of us.

2368
01:27:48,266 --> 01:27:50,034
- Come on. - You are so greedy.

2369
01:27:50,034 --> 01:27:53,404
"Years and years and years and"? That's longer than our part.

2370
01:27:53,404 --> 01:27:56,774
I must remove you if you improvise again.

2371
01:27:56,774 --> 01:27:58,977
(I must remove you if you improvise again.)

2372
01:27:58,977 --> 01:28:01,179
- What? - Who do you think you are?

2373
01:28:01,179 --> 01:28:03,248
Go away.

2374
01:28:04,249 --> 01:28:05,550
Are you drunk?

2375
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,118
- Come on. - I am not drunk!

2376
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:10,088
- Are you drunk? - I will remove you!

2377
01:28:10,088 --> 01:28:11,756
- Let's keep it clean. - Okay.

2378
01:28:11,756 --> 01:28:13,558
- Look how nice they are. - I am sorry.

2379
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:18,596
When K.Will plays the flute,

2380
01:28:18,596 --> 01:28:20,999
Gi Beom can improvise.

2381
01:28:20,999 --> 01:28:23,167
- Say what you want to say. - You get to say something.

2382
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:25,770
You can't say, "Han Gi Beom is the king of basketball."

2383
01:28:26,304 --> 01:28:27,539
Don't promote yourself.

2384
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:29,507
- Let's do this. - Okay.

2385
01:28:29,507 --> 01:28:32,577
Gi Beom, put yourself at ease.

2386
01:28:32,844 --> 01:28:36,447
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2387
01:28:36,748 --> 01:28:38,816
- Running Man is... - Rated...

2388
01:28:38,816 --> 01:28:40,285
- 12... - Years and...

2389
01:28:40,285 --> 01:28:41,819
- Older. - Older.

2390
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:43,087
Honey, I love you.

2391
01:28:43,087 --> 01:28:44,589
Me, too.

2392
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,226
- Honey, I love you. - Me, too.

2393
01:28:49,127 --> 01:28:51,296
- I couldn't help but say it. - It's not true.

2394
01:28:51,296 --> 01:28:53,298
(It's not true that you love her.)

2395
01:28:54,265 --> 01:28:56,568
Don't say it's not true. Hold on.

2396
01:28:56,568 --> 01:28:58,770
Don't say that.

2397
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:01,406
Stop him from improvising, but don't say it's not true.

2398
01:29:01,606 --> 01:29:03,374
Don't say that.

2399
01:29:03,374 --> 01:29:05,877
- How would you know? - I am sorry. It just came out.

2400
01:29:05,877 --> 01:29:08,179
You don't know if it's untrue.

2401
01:29:08,179 --> 01:29:11,349
- I am so annoyed. - I am sorry. It just came out.

2402
01:29:11,349 --> 01:29:13,885
- I am sorry. - Let's keep it clean.

2403
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:16,387
- Let's do this with seriousness. - Let's do that.

2404
01:29:16,387 --> 01:29:18,189
- This is the real round. - Let's go.

2405
01:29:18,189 --> 01:29:19,958
(The fourth take)

2406
01:29:20,625 --> 01:29:22,627
- Three. Running Man is... - Running Man is...

2407
01:29:22,627 --> 01:29:24,095
- Rated... - 12...

2408
01:29:24,095 --> 01:29:25,997
- Years and... - Older.

2409
01:29:25,997 --> 01:29:27,398
Honey, I love you.

2410
01:29:27,999 --> 01:29:30,535
(He even plays the flute perfectly.)

2411
01:29:31,769 --> 01:29:34,906
(Cut! It's over at last.)

2412
01:29:34,906 --> 01:29:36,174
Good job!

2413
01:29:36,174 --> 01:29:38,176
(Everyone, good job.)

2414
01:29:39,477 --> 01:29:42,413
(The shoot of the TV rating notice ends at last.)

2415
01:29:42,413 --> 01:29:43,815
Hey, now that we stopped being greedy...

2416
01:29:43,815 --> 01:29:45,516
Now that we stopped being selfish...

2417
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:47,118
- That was nice. - It's done.

2418
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:48,286
Good work.

2419
01:29:48,286 --> 01:29:49,954
- That was great. It was great. - We did it.

2420
01:29:49,954 --> 01:29:51,089
It worked because we stopped being greedy.

2421
01:29:51,089 --> 01:29:52,090
Let's take a group photo.

2422
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:53,324
- It was great. - That sounds great.

2423
01:29:53,324 --> 01:29:54,826
(Thank you for joining us for the finale of the TV rating notice.)

2424
01:29:54,826 --> 01:29:56,427
Great job. 1, 2.

2425
01:29:57,095 --> 01:29:59,664
