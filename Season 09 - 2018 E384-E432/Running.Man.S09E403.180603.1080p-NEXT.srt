1
00:00:08,912 --> 00:00:13,025
(A culture center in Pyeongtaek is on the brink of early summer.)

2
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:14,980
- Is this why we're here? - What?

3
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,120
- Are we here to write that? - I guess so.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,765
They said we had to write something. This is driving me crazy.

5
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:25,435
(My gosh, I have a bad feeling about this.)

6
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:26,890
Why is my heart beating fast?

7
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,330
- Besides, the space is tight here. - It's beating fast right away.

8
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:31,845
- We're crowded over a small table. - What's going on?

9
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:35,270
Before we start our filming today, you must fill out a form.

10
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:36,870
That's why I asked you to come in.

11
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:40,010
This is the consent form for the wing walking in England.

12
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,710
(This is the consent form for the wing walking in England.)

13
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,440
(A consent form for wing walking?)

14
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:45,780
- Listen. - Wait.

15
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:49,325
- The consent form... - Only the ones who will...

16
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:53,790
(It's the highlight of the Shuddering Package in England.)

17
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,390
(They'll stand on a plane at 217km per hour without gear.)

18
00:00:57,394 --> 00:01:01,330
(They must have a physical checkup and fill out the safety agreement.)

19
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:04,600
I was so excited to film today. You should've given this after work.

20
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,330
Exactly. It's bringing down my spirits.

21
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:08,170
(They are feeling dejected.)

22
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,440
(Feeling gloomy)

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,315
To be honest, from what I heard,

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,810
- people over 78kg can't ride it. - Is that so?

25
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:16,810
- It's 80kg. - Right now,

26
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:18,410
- I weigh... - People over 80kg can't ride it?

27
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:20,010
People over 80kg can't participate.

28
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:21,680
- Right now, - I should eat a lot of meals now.

29
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,355
- I weigh 76kg. - I should gain weight.

30
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,850
- I should eat a lot of meals now. - I should gain weight.

31
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,290
I weigh 76kg now.

32
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,590
- Really? - Yes.

33
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:32,135
- Hey, we should gain weight. - I'm serious.

34
00:01:32,395 --> 00:01:34,430
If you pull a trick like that,

35
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:37,600
we'll come up with projects which will enable you to lose weight...

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,030
- before going to England. - My gosh.

37
00:01:40,036 --> 00:01:43,115
We can start eating a lot starting with the in-flight meals.

38
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,585
How much do you weigh?

39
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,615
I weigh 62kg now.

40
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,040
Goodness, Jae Seok.

41
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,485
I weigh 62kg now.

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,755
Will you gain 18kg?

43
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:53,280
Will you gain 18kg?

44
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:56,250
You are nowhere near close. You can't gain 18kg.

45
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,320
(Is he thinking about consuming an entire cow on the plane?)

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,650
- Will you gain 18kg? - Don't say anything.

47
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,090
- If he gains 18kg, exempt him. - Don't say anything.

48
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,805
- Through in-flight meals? - Then you should exempt him.

49
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,060
I'll respect that.

50
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:07,060
That's right. If he gains 18kg,

51
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,830
I will wing walk without a complaint.

52
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,400
- 18kg through in-flight meals? - Right.

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,430
(Please give me high-calorie meals.)

54
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,975
If you do that, we will exempt you.

55
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:15,415
That means Da Hee and I have no choice but to go.

56
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:17,870
- Who? - Da Hee and I have no choice.

57
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:19,470
With Da Hee, you never know.

58
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:22,710
(Since women weigh less...)

59
00:02:22,712 --> 00:02:24,580
(You never know how much she weighs.)

60
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,550
- Da Hee is tall. - That's right.

61
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,795
So Min...

62
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:30,865
I will have to gain 30kg.

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,290
- Stop lying. - Stop lying.

64
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,860
- What are you talking about? - I am telling you the truth.

65
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:39,660
- You are lying. - You just need to gain 2kg.

66
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:41,630
- I am telling you the truth. - "Princess Aurora" was ages ago.

67
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:43,160
I am telling you the truth.

68
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,930
- So Min, don't be like that. - I am telling you the truth.

69
00:02:44,934 --> 00:02:47,100
Also, why did you say that you needed to gain 30kg...

70
00:02:47,103 --> 00:02:48,470
when no one else did?

71
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,685
- Seriously. - What's wrong with you?

72
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,445
Don't be like that, So Min.

73
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,585
Alcoholics are forbidden as well.

74
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:58,625
Isn't that for you? Seizure patients can't wing walk either.

75
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,350
Seizure, my foot.

76
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,780
You won't be able to do it.

77
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:02,950
- Why not? - High blood pressure.

78
00:03:02,952 --> 00:03:04,965
It says here that mental stability is important.

79
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:06,350
What about it?

80
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,590
- Aren't you two unstable? - No, we're not.

81
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,590
No?

82
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:13,260
Look at this. "Poor vision poses no problems."

83
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,230
Jae Seok.

84
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,330
(Poor vision poses no problems to wing walking.)

85
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:17,930
(Do you wear glasses? It's not a problem.)

86
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:19,000
That won't do.

87
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,600
(Do you wear glasses? It's not a problem.)

88
00:03:20,603 --> 00:03:22,645
Losing 18kg is the only way.

89
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:24,340
(He wishes he had reasons for disqualification.)

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,985
For goodness' sake.

91
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,855
- That's his only weakness. - Poor vision?

92
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,825
We have the right to cancel on the day of the flight.

93
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:35,050
- Can we cancel once we are there? - Oh, they have the right.

94
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:38,295
(Oh, they have the right.)

95
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,195
Who are they?

96
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,335
Who do they think they are?

97
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,335
We don't have the right.

98
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,505
- We don't have the right. - Really?

99
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:47,975
Hold on.

100
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:51,045
I can't climb up the wing through the cockpit.

101
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,500
(The directions for wing walking shock them.)

102
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,170
- Where is it? - You just need to sign...

103
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,785
the official consent form.

104
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,100
(Thinking)

105
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,540
Jae Seok always said that...

106
00:04:01,544 --> 00:04:05,725
- we must watch what we sign. - Of course.

107
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:06,950
I am serious.

108
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,450
I almost got into a big trouble by signing a document carelessly.

109
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,920
We can never be too careful when it comes to contracts.

110
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,090
We might lose our entire fortune.

111
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,890
Back in the days, stuntmen did this on TV.

112
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,975
- Right. - It makes no sense for us to do it.

113
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,045
Didn't Tom Hanks become famous by doing these stunts?

114
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,800
- Right? - What about Tom Hanks?

115
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:27,515
He did his own stunts for movies.

116
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,015
- When? - That's Tom Cruise.

117
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:30,100
I see.

118
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:31,870
(That's Tom Cruise.)

119
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,940
(The Toms confused me.)

120
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,155
Tom Hanks?

121
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:35,810
Doesn't he have an intelligent image?

122
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:36,955
I can't believe you.

123
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,110
This is...

124
00:04:38,114 --> 00:04:41,650
(Time passes, and they become more stressed out.)

125
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:43,425
You are signing the forms, right?

126
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,095
No one is signing it.

127
00:04:45,522 --> 00:04:46,995
- No one is signing it. - I can't.

128
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,720
- Come on. - Why isn't anyone signing it?

129
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:50,760
- I can't. - Why isn't anyone signing it?

130
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,990
Isn't there a height restriction?

131
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:53,460
There is no height restriction.

132
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,175
I am 205cm tall.

133
00:04:55,932 --> 00:04:57,200
Is that okay?

134
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,645
Is it safe for someone my age?

135
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:01,445
You are closer to the age limit than you are to the weight limit.

136
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:03,215
- The limit is 65 years or older. - Right.

137
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,070
- The limit is 65 years or older. - Right.

138
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:06,140
(He is closer to the age limit.)

139
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:08,955
- You are closer to the age limit. - You should have been a bit older.

140
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,525
(Grabbing)

141
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:18,250
What are you doing? What are you doing?

142
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,520
(He tries to sign Kwang Soo's consent form.)

143
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:23,420
Even if Seok Jin signs...

144
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,035
Hello.

145
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,230
- This form... - Hello.

146
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,675
- We are signing the consent form. - What are you signing?

147
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,930
- The consent form? - It's for wing walking.

148
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:33,945
- Is that the consent form? - Yes.

149
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,615
Jong Kook, the restroom's upstairs.

150
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:37,815
- What? - Go away.

151
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,185
- Don't I need to do this? - Get lost if you aren't partaking!

152
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,955
You don't need to wing walk!

153
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:44,380
I am sorry.

154
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,410
(Gosh, I am sorry.)

155
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:46,755
Let me take a look.

156
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:50,295
"Physical fitness"! What is this? Why is this...

157
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:51,950
- Go to the second floor. - Doctor...

158
00:05:51,955 --> 00:05:53,420
"Doctor certificate"!

159
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:54,890
(He continues to be flippant.)

160
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,035
I can't believe you need it.

161
00:05:56,326 --> 00:05:57,490
He is so annoying.

162
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:58,960
(He is so annoying.)

163
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,675
I guess it's possible to get killed. In any case, take care.

164
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:06,175
You should consult your lawyers...

165
00:06:06,502 --> 00:06:07,845
before you sign that form.

166
00:06:08,104 --> 00:06:10,540
(He is 10 times more annoying than usual.)

167
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,785
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

168
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:15,555
Write your names in English in capital letters.

169
00:06:16,112 --> 00:06:18,655
Look at this. You are 53kg.

170
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:20,895
Why did you say you needed to gain 30kg?

171
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,950
It's only a difference of 2 or 3kg.

172
00:06:22,952 --> 00:06:23,950
(Don't be so fastidious.)

173
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,195
I don't want to write my name.

174
00:06:26,022 --> 00:06:27,290
I don't want to write my name.

175
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,665
(He makes sure the others are filling out the form.)

176
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:31,105
Let's do this. It won't kill me.

177
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:33,635
- Seok Jin filled out the form. - Are you waiving your life?

178
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:35,830
Hey.

179
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:37,800
It has nothing to do with you.

180
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,230
(Another unwelcome guest visits.)

181
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,615
I feel bad.

182
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,015
He should be here.

183
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,540
Haha, you should be here.

184
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,270
He should be where I am.

185
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,340
- Haha. - Yes?

186
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:49,810
Don't say that you feel bad when you can't even read the form.

187
00:06:49,812 --> 00:06:52,080
- Doesn't it say, "psycho"? - "Psycho"?

188
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:56,525
It says, "physical", for goodness' sake.

189
00:06:56,953 --> 00:07:00,265
- "Physical"? - "Psycho", my foot.

190
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,565
- He should be here! - For goodness' sake.

191
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,735
Nothing brings a smile to my face.

192
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,175
I can't smile.

193
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:09,275
I feel bad.

194
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:11,345
Haha.

195
00:07:11,534 --> 00:07:14,000
If you have signed the form, please turn it in.

196
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,300
Okay, I will collect them.

197
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:17,440
(Okay, I will collect them.)

198
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,340
(It's none of my business, so I am inclined to help.)

199
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:21,555
It says here that we need leg muscles.

200
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:25,525
(They finish filling out the consent form for wing walking.)

201
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:28,680
Do we really go out the door and climb up the wing?

202
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:30,420
That's impossible.

203
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,820
We will take your physical abilities into consideration...

204
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:35,390
and adjust accordingly.

205
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,460
Even if you only hang on without doing anything,

206
00:07:38,461 --> 00:07:39,805
it will be frightening.

207
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,760
I don't even like airplane rides.

208
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:43,800
I get scared of airplane rides.

209
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,530
(Serious)

210
00:07:45,535 --> 00:07:46,875
The atmosphere is bad.

211
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,270
(He realizes that taking his leave is the best option.)

212
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:51,470
I can't believe him.

213
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,955
He is so annoying.

214
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:57,680
He smiled in such a carefree way.

215
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,255
- He's going to Switzerland. - Can we be put on anesthesia?

216
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,050
(Desperate)

217
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:03,720
I had the same thought.

218
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,065
(I want to wake up in Korea.)

219
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,390
(They finish signing.)

220
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,520
It's the weather you get in LA.

221
00:08:08,524 --> 00:08:09,620
(They go outside for an opening.)

222
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,105
The weather is nice.

223
00:08:11,661 --> 00:08:14,130
Please sit on the chair with your name.

224
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,305
Hey.

225
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,430
Would you stop bringing the giraffe every time we do this?

226
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:18,500
It's not the giraffe.

227
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:20,445
(It's not the giraffe.)

228
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,070
It's the giraffe.

229
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:23,170
(I can tell.)

230
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:25,340
- It looks like the giraffe. - It's not it.

231
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,670
The silhouette makes it obvious.

232
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:28,555
For goodness' sake.

233
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,125
- Really? - Really?

234
00:08:32,615 --> 00:08:35,050
A poll that was conducted on Teachers' Day revealed that...

235
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:37,665
Jae Seok is the top celebrity the students want as a teacher.

236
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,620
Second is Park Bo Gum.

237
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:40,990
Third is Kang Daniel.

238
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,165
- He beat Daniel. - Really?

239
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,035
Thank you.

240
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,275
Those students are asking to be tired.

241
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,630
He nags all the time.

242
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,745
If Jae Seok is a teacher, the students will suffocate.

243
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:55,200
He says that if I am a teacher, the students will suffocate.

244
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:56,300
If Jong Kook is a teacher,

245
00:08:56,305 --> 00:08:59,215
the students won't be able to go to school.

246
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,340
- That's right. - I will be strict.

247
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:03,510
- It will be too scary. - It will be too scary.

248
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,480
(Only those who can brave his Spartan ways can go to school.)

249
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,750
I will tell you why I asked you to sit down.

250
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,880
What are we doing?

251
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:11,265
Like I told you in advance,

252
00:09:11,454 --> 00:09:13,820
you must be isolated at one location for the entire day...

253
00:09:13,823 --> 00:09:14,990
for today's Isolated Race.

254
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:17,460
(You must be isolated for Isolated Race.)

255
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,935
This is bad.

256
00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,630
Why do we keep getting isolated?

257
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:22,860
For goodness' sake.

258
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:25,830
We asked each of you to bring three items...

259
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:28,915
another member would need to live in isolation.

260
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,240
"Please bring three items Kim Jong Kook would need..."

261
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,810
"to live in isolation."

262
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:39,025
Are you serious? Is this really happening?

263
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,495
Don't be like that, Se Chan.

264
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,365
Should I give him stir-fried small octopus?

265
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,620
It needs to be microwaved.

266
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:48,165
Don't do that. It's mine.

267
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,605
Three items Song Ji Hyo would need.

268
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:55,760
Firstly, you need toilet paper.

269
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:56,990
(Ji Hyo's best friend, Kim Sung Oh)

270
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,500
You need to go to the restroom even if you are in isolation.

271
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:00,770
(Haha needs toilet paper if he goes to the restroom.)

272
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,045
You are right.

273
00:10:02,171 --> 00:10:05,485
The three items Jae Seok needs when he is in isolation.

274
00:10:05,842 --> 00:10:08,655
I prepared three items...

275
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:10,615
as if I was his biological brother.

276
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,110
It's a pack of scorched rice.

277
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,750
(He gets a pack of scorched rice for So Min.)

278
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,220
Seaweed bloats in your stomach.

279
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,395
It's kelp.

280
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:20,590
- It's kelp. - Isn't it seaweed?

281
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,935
- It's kelp. - Kelp?

282
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:24,005
Let's start over.

283
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,005
Kelp.

284
00:10:26,362 --> 00:10:30,775
(They finish picking 3 items for the members.)

285
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,500
The seating arrangement reveals who brought items for whom.

286
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,915
So Min has items for Kwang Soo, Kwang Soo has items for Jae Seok.

287
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,340
My items...

288
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,340
cater to Se Chan.

289
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:41,710
- Do they cater to me? - Yes.

290
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:43,510
My items cater to Jong Kook, too.

291
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,680
(My items cater to Jong Kook, too.)

292
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,780
Haha,

293
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:49,125
you didn't bring fatsia shoots, did you?

294
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:51,320
If you did, I hate you.

295
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,620
I really didn't.

296
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:54,735
Let me tell you this in advance.

297
00:10:54,824 --> 00:10:56,820
If that's a stuffed giraffe, I promise I will end you.

298
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:58,005
It's not a stuffed giraffe.

299
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:00,830
(If that's a stuffed giraffe, I promise I will end you.)

300
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,230
If that's a stuffed giraffe, I promise I will end you.

301
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:03,430
I...

302
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:05,200
I think you are getting rid of the stuffed giraffes...

303
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,800
- since you have so many at home. - That's not true.

304
00:11:06,802 --> 00:11:08,800
I started off as a joke,

305
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:10,940
- but I soon became absorbed. - Right.

306
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,685
- Jae Seok is alone on an island, - You need to be serious.

307
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,710
and I am the only 1 who can send him 3 items.

308
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,155
I soon became absorbed.

309
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:22,150
Do you remember Wilson in "Cast Away"?

310
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:25,365
(Do you remember Wilson in "Cast Away"?)

311
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:31,390
(Wilson, the only friend for the lonely man)

312
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,805
For Jae Seok,

313
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,530
I brought Wilby.

314
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:38,675
(A friend for an isolated life, Wilby)

315
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,070
(After Danbi...)

316
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,670
(and Dolby,)

317
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:44,140
(Wilby appears.)

318
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,385
(Kicking)

319
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,610
(You "will be" dead.)

320
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,810
- What? - Kwang Soo.

321
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,310
- Bite him. - Wait.

322
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,880
- Kwang Soo. - No way.

323
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:53,785
(They see the giraffe too many times.)

324
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:57,520
This is Wilby who will be Jae Seok's friend.

325
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,820
He can't stand on his own.

326
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,490
He brings the stuffed giraffe every chance he gets.

327
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,735
This is the real thing.

328
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:04,260
Goodness.

329
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,360
This is the real thing.

330
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:06,860
(He's rather excited.)

331
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:10,030
If I didn't know Jae Seok well,

332
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:12,075
- I couldn't have brought it. - Really?

333
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:16,700
When we're shooting or when we're on a break from shooting,

334
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,115
- Yes? - he always looks for this.

335
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,340
It's a cloth for wiping glasses.

336
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:23,980
(It's a cloth for wiping glasses.)

337
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,880
Seriously, Jae Seok.

338
00:12:25,881 --> 00:12:27,080
You wipe your glasses often.

339
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,295
(You always look for it.)

340
00:12:28,351 --> 00:12:31,920
(That's definitely necessary.)

341
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,120
It's necessary.

342
00:12:33,122 --> 00:12:36,165
- Really. - Why would he wipe his glasses?

343
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:37,905
He's about to die.

344
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:41,375
- Don't you see how genuine I am? - Come on.

345
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:46,475
(Kwang Soo brings Wilby, a magazine, and a cloth.)

346
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:48,970
I brought some items for Kwang Soo.

347
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,070
- Be serious. - Show us.

348
00:12:50,072 --> 00:12:51,840
These are for when he's isolated.

349
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:54,455
- I'm on a deserted island. - They must be necessary.

350
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,710
(What does she think Kwang Soo will need?)

351
00:12:56,712 --> 00:12:58,125
First of all...

352
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,480
What's that? It looks nice.

353
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,895
- What is it? - It's a microphone.

354
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:04,965
(A microphone?)

355
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:09,165
- It's so that he doesn't get bored. - It'll keep him from being bored.

356
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:11,305
So that I can sing?

357
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:12,760
That's great.

358
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,230
(Is there a meaning behind this microphone?)

359
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:16,630
He can do this too.

360
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,745
"Save me!"

361
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,515
(Save me!)

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,770
"I'm Lee Kwang Soo. Please save me."

363
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,210
- He can use it for this. - That's good.

364
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,610
- I see. - I can see how genuine she is.

365
00:13:29,612 --> 00:13:30,880
- Right? - Right.

366
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,625
- That's a good idea. - I thought about it very carefully.

367
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:38,265
I thought you'd need a paper and a pen.

368
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:41,835
I brought them because when he's isolated,

369
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,360
he might die.

370
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,560
You must let people know about your death.

371
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,205
He has to report his death.

372
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,805
A will?

373
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:53,330
- You should write a will. - Right.

374
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,670
- Death? I shouldn't die. - It's just in case.

375
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,740
Kwang Soo, I'm jealous of you.

376
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:00,810
- I'm satisfied. - It's as if she's his girlfriend.

377
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,140
Thank you so much.

378
00:14:02,144 --> 00:14:05,025
This is why people think you're dating.

379
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,180
There are always rumors.

380
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,780
Even if there are rumors,

381
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:10,950
- no one... - No one cares.

382
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:13,680
- They just laugh. - People don't really care.

383
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,235
- It's not exciting. - Right.

384
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:18,160
They don't follow the 123 of a typical couple in love.

385
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,260
- "123"? - I'm getting angry.

386
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:21,230
(123 means an equation that resembles something.)

387
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,305
It's a professional term. They don't work.

388
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:25,475
Just because he's experienced...

389
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:28,415
(Jong Kook tries to be arrogant.)

390
00:14:29,071 --> 00:14:31,985
(Kwang Soo gets a sketchbook, a pen, a gas lighter, and a microphone.)

391
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,440
I brought these for Se Chan.

392
00:14:34,443 --> 00:14:37,655
I thought about what I would need when I'm isolated.

393
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:41,150
That's good. Jae Seok wouldn't get playful.

394
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,295
Of course not.

395
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:44,820
We need water when isolated.

396
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,365
(We need water when isolated.)

397
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:48,620
(Jae Seok is genuine.)

398
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,590
He's like an honest teacher.

399
00:14:50,593 --> 00:14:53,560
Look, we need water the most when we're isolated.

400
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,205
- That's impressive. - Water?

401
00:14:56,866 --> 00:14:58,145
Wait.

402
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,170
(Let me drink some.)

403
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,170
Why are you drinking it? It's my water.

404
00:15:03,172 --> 00:15:04,570
- I'm thirsty. - It's mine.

405
00:15:04,573 --> 00:15:05,815
I got it.

406
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,355
He'll give you a new one.

407
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:09,655
- Right? - Of course.

408
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,710
- Here's water for Se Chan. - This is good.

409
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,980
I brought this while thinking that I'm isolated.

410
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:16,250
I'm also thirsty.

411
00:15:16,252 --> 00:15:18,565
- Also... - Give me some too.

412
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:20,050
He's so genuine.

413
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:21,390
He was serious about it.

414
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,490
(Everyone is thirsty.)

415
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:24,760
Is this the last? Will you give me a new one?

416
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,790
We won't.

417
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,760
(What are you talking about?)

418
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,075
Come on.

419
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:30,530
Stop him.

420
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:32,300
(He takes it after the water is almost gone.)

421
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:33,900
There isn't much left.

422
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,400
Goodness.

423
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:38,040
You'll survive 15 days with that amount.

424
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,540
You'll survive 15 days.

425
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,585
(He had no idea then.)

426
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:46,725
(Will limited resources cause a fight for items?)

427
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:51,295
(Who will be the last to survive in the Isolated Race?)

428
00:15:52,321 --> 00:15:54,635
The three items aren't related at all.

429
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,990
Each item is unique in its own way.

430
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,060
(Cup noodles, water, and a board game)

431
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,330
For me, it was So Min. I really pondered for a long time.

432
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,630
So Min is quite special.

433
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:05,900
All she needs are fatsia shoots and chogochujang.

434
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,170
No, I don't like fatsia shoots.

435
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,070
This is what I brought.

436
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,240
What is it?

437
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,240
- This is... - What is it?

438
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,510
That looks interesting.

439
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,985
- Isn't it a cleaner? - Is that what you thought?

440
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:20,425
This catches bugs.

441
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:22,050
(Impressed)

442
00:16:22,051 --> 00:16:23,250
- Does it suck them in? - Watch.

443
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:25,520
(Watch what I'm doing.)

444
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,520
(Sound of a motor running)

445
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,935
The bugs get sucked inside.

446
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,960
Take this off and close the lid.

447
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:34,230
You can see them through the magnifying glass.

448
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,530
Does it catch insects?

449
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:37,235
Like ants?

450
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,200
That's good.

451
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:41,570
You might think that this was its sole purpose.

452
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,970
However, it's more meaningful than that.

453
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,840
It's when So Min is struggling.

454
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:48,210
(It's when she's at risk.)

455
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,080
What will she do about the smell if she has to fart?

456
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,210
She can use it behind herself.

457
00:16:53,215 --> 00:16:54,925
(Suck in the smell.)

458
00:16:57,152 --> 00:17:00,320
- You can magnify it too. - Right.

459
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:01,690
- It can be used for anything. - She can see that too.

460
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,190
It's one machine,

461
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:06,260
but it can be used for several purposes.

462
00:17:06,262 --> 00:17:07,730
That's impressive.

463
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,330
It's an insect catcher.

464
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:11,500
(List of items while isolated)

465
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,600
(Microphone, sketchbook, water, Wilby, magazine, cloth for...)

466
00:17:13,602 --> 00:17:14,770
(wiping glasses, cup noodles, board game, book, soccer ball...)

467
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,215
- Everyone gave their items. - Yes.

468
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:20,285
Today is Isolated Race, Pick Me War.

469
00:17:20,843 --> 00:17:22,955
- "Pick Me"? - "Pick Me"?

470
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:27,895
You'll be isolated here and survive only with the items given to you.

471
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,955
(Survive until the end only with the given items.)

472
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,920
- How can I survive with this? - I know.

473
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,120
What about food?

474
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:36,335
Goodness.

475
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:38,160
- I'm in trouble. - Will you give us food?

476
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,575
You will vote once every hour.

477
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,275
The member with the lowest number of votes...

478
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,215
will be flogged by the winner as many times as they want.

479
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,570
- What? - Okay.

480
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:51,740
What did you say?

481
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,785
(Infinite number of flogging?)

482
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,010
(The flogging hurts from head to toe.)

483
00:17:57,012 --> 00:18:00,525
(The winner gets to beat as many times as they want.)

484
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:03,595
- That's too harsh. - The penalty is too harsh.

485
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:07,725
There will be three rounds of voting.

486
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:12,005
Each person gets to vote five people.

487
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:16,130
You can't vote for yourself. You may vote one person twice.

488
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,390
For example,

489
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:20,045
Seok Jin may vote for Ji Hyo five times.

490
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,300
Each member receives...

491
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:25,770
a promissory note with a limit of 1,000 dollars.

492
00:18:25,774 --> 00:18:28,185
(Each member gets a promissory note with a limit of 1,000 dollars.)

493
00:18:28,544 --> 00:18:31,510
With the given promissory note,

494
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,580
you may exchange your items.

495
00:18:33,582 --> 00:18:35,180
How do we use it?

496
00:18:35,184 --> 00:18:36,450
You can buy my items.

497
00:18:36,452 --> 00:18:40,150
- Write how much money you'll pay. - To buy it?

498
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,390
Write down the amount.

499
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,460
You must fulfill what you promise on the note.

500
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,760
Can I sell my items?

501
00:18:45,761 --> 00:18:47,220
Yes, you can.

502
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:50,005
The member who gains the highest amount in promissory notes...

503
00:18:50,032 --> 00:18:53,345
gets to exchange it with a prize that's worth the amount.

504
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,800
A three-item set for the summer looks good.

505
00:18:55,804 --> 00:18:57,515
There's also food.

506
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,785
We can win some food too.

507
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,040
- Some are helpful. - We get to eat.

508
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:04,255
- We can survive at least. - Right.

509
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,850
You may exchange anything with the promissory note.

510
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,650
Kwang Soo brought this which I can't even sell.

511
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,565
You might be able to sell it.

512
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:15,390
I should sell "Anger Management" to Ji Hyo.

513
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:16,965
No, thank you.

514
00:19:17,393 --> 00:19:19,460
Jong Kook doesn't get angry when he doesn't see anything.

515
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:22,475
I should sell the sleep mask to Jong Kook.

516
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:25,075
- To cover his eyes? - To cover his eyes?

517
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,900
He won't get angry if he can't see.

518
00:19:26,902 --> 00:19:28,945
What's that market?

519
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:32,685
(Running Man Market is open.)

520
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,970
(It will be an oasis for a difficult isolated life.)

521
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:39,655
(There's everything from daily necessities to snacks.)

522
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:42,580
Can you tell us how much a bottle of water is?

523
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,455
Yes, it's 500 dollars per bottle.

524
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:46,550
- What? - What?

525
00:19:46,555 --> 00:19:48,320
- What? - What did you say?

526
00:19:48,323 --> 00:19:50,450
- Really? - Are you insane?

527
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:52,090
- I'll sell my water... - Are you insane?

528
00:19:52,094 --> 00:19:53,360
for 200 dollars.

529
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:55,330
This is 490 dollars.

530
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,930
- You're such thieves. - It's 200 dollars.

531
00:19:57,933 --> 00:20:00,400
I won't buy any water even if I die of thirst.

532
00:20:00,402 --> 00:20:01,670
I won't buy it.

533
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,815
(He claims a boycott.)

534
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,970
The items that you have now won't be enough...

535
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,740
- to survive, right? - Yes.

536
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:08,855
Among 1.5L of water,

537
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:12,225
toilet paper, and ramyeon set,

538
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,980
you get a chance to win one of them.

539
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:18,020
(They get a chance to win one more item.)

540
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,680
You'll play Pirate Roulette Game.

541
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:22,320
(Pirate Roulette Game)

542
00:20:22,324 --> 00:20:23,565
We're playing it again.

543
00:20:23,692 --> 00:20:26,005
- Okay, okay. - Wait.

544
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,560
Take turns sticking a knife in the pirate barrel.

545
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:32,775
The one to catch the pirate and put it in another barrel wins.

546
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:36,715
Divide into groups of four.

547
00:20:37,072 --> 00:20:39,285
It's worth playing as long as I can avoid Jong Kook.

548
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:41,040
It's over if you play with Jong Kook.

549
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,455
What color Jong Kook picks will be important.

550
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,025
Mine is yellow.

551
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:47,585
Mine is red.

552
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,550
Yellow is better.

553
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,365
- What about Seok Jin? - I got yellow.

554
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,720
Weak players got together.

555
00:20:53,722 --> 00:20:54,990
(The weak players increase their chances.)

556
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,290
Mine is red.

557
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,290
(Se Chan picks red.)

558
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,635
Mine is yellow.

559
00:20:58,861 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm playing with weak players.

560
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:01,975
(Team Yellow is made up of weak players.)

561
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:04,535
- Mine is red. - Kwang Soo.

562
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,630
(Team Red is made up of strong players.)

563
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:09,800
- I'm in trouble. - Will it be So Min or Jong Kook?

564
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:11,640
(Which team Jong Kook is in is important.)

565
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,170
Join Team Yellow, So Min.

566
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:15,510
One. So Min should be Team Yellow.

567
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:16,785
1, 2, 3.

568
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:20,080
(Which color did So Min pick?)

569
00:21:20,082 --> 00:21:21,140
Mine is yellow.

570
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,695
(It's yellow.)

571
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:26,420
- I have a chance. - It's worth playing.

572
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,235
It's definitely worth playing.

573
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:30,935
- Mine is red. - Jong Kook.

574
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:33,205
I don't want to play with Kwang Soo either.

575
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:35,560
Jong Kook is the strongest.

576
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:36,705
(Will Team Red be okay?)

577
00:21:37,332 --> 00:21:39,600
(Haha, Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and So Min are on Team Yellow.)

578
00:21:39,601 --> 00:21:42,015
(Ji Hyo, Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Jong Kook are on Team Red.)

579
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,170
(Team Red plays first.)

580
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:46,040
- Rock-paper-scissors - Jong Kook will win anyway.

581
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:47,185
Rock-paper-scissors

582
00:21:47,442 --> 00:21:48,655
- You'll start? - Yes.

583
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:51,380
- Hands on ears. - Keep the pace fast.

584
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,940
Kwang Soo is in the best position.

585
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:54,950
Let's go.

586
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,895
(Rattling)

587
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:59,250
Okay.

588
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,020
(It's Ji Hyo's turn.)

589
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,720
- It's Ji Hyo's turn. - It's Ji Hyo's turn.

590
00:22:02,724 --> 00:22:05,335
(Please)

591
00:22:05,961 --> 00:22:07,705
(In)

592
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:09,630
(It's the master of this game, Kwang Soo's turn.)

593
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,975
It'll pop out.

594
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,145
(In)

595
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:14,570
Is it my turn?

596
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,715
(Is it my turn?)

597
00:22:18,173 --> 00:22:19,540
(Wobbling)

598
00:22:19,541 --> 00:22:22,810
(What?)

599
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:24,780
- He cheated. - Jong Kook.

600
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,380
- What is this? - You can't do that.

601
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:27,880
- You have to hold it. - It has to pop out first.

602
00:22:27,883 --> 00:22:29,950
- What is this? - I was getting ready.

603
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:33,780
There's no problem with getting ready to catch it.

604
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:34,790
Okay.

605
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,235
(They accept it.)

606
00:22:36,592 --> 00:22:37,735
It has to go all the way in.

607
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,635
It's not going to pop out.

608
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:41,605
It won't pop out.

609
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,890
It's incredible that he's not making it pop out.

610
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:46,100
(It's Jong Kook's turn again.)

611
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:47,200
Hey!

612
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:48,570
(Wobbling)

613
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,070
- Gosh. - So this is okay?

614
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,970
- He's a cheater. - Don't make things complicated!

615
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,310
- He's a cheater. - He's definitely a cheater.

616
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,710
- It's too complicated. - He's a cheater with strength.

617
00:22:57,713 --> 00:22:59,210
- What did you do? - Why did you have to do that?

618
00:22:59,214 --> 00:23:01,280
- What's with you? - It's really not okay.

619
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:02,595
It's seriously not okay.

620
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:05,120
- Hold on. - There you go.

621
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,320
- It'll be fine. - It's going to pop out.

622
00:23:07,322 --> 00:23:08,435
Is it in?

623
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,235
1, 2, 3.

624
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,760
- There aren't many left. - It's been going on for so long.

625
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:13,920
It's going on forever.

626
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:15,405
(There are only 4 empty slots.)

627
00:23:15,664 --> 00:23:19,000
(It's about time.)

628
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,260
(Moving)

629
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,940
(Kwang Soo is getting ready.)

630
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,940
(Wriggling)

631
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:27,640
- Stop it. - What are you doing?

632
00:23:27,643 --> 00:23:29,085
That's not okay.

633
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:32,025
It's not going to pop.

634
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,325
(It pops out.)

635
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:40,965
(It hits Jae Seok's face.)

636
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:44,860
(The pirate that's popped out by Kwang Soo...)

637
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,975
(hits Jae Seok's face hard.)

638
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:52,245
(Hit)

639
00:23:56,705 --> 00:23:59,415
(Knockdown)

640
00:23:59,441 --> 00:24:03,110
(He is so unlucky.)

641
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,370
(Meanwhile)

642
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:06,425
Kwang Soo, stand over there.

643
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:08,080
How did you get hit?

644
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,450
(It's Jong Kook versus the other three.)

645
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:12,550
Gosh. No one is asking if I'm okay.

646
00:24:12,554 --> 00:24:14,380
- Go away! - Go away!

647
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,990
- Go away! - It's your fault...

648
00:24:15,991 --> 00:24:18,235
- Jong Kook caught it. - Gosh.

649
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,260
How did you get hit right in the face?

650
00:24:21,263 --> 00:24:23,975
You have to stop him.

651
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,745
- Jong Kook shouldn't move on. - It must hurt.

652
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:29,470
(Everyone's tense.)

653
00:24:29,471 --> 00:24:31,470
I'll be in the front.

654
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:33,540
Show us that you can beat him.

655
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,255
The three of you can do it.

656
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:38,180
- You can do it. - They're holding him.

657
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,755
- Ji Hyo! - They're holding him.

658
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,695
- They're competing. - Ji Hyo!

659
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,120
There you go.

660
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,465
(It's a mess.)

661
00:24:47,122 --> 00:24:50,020
(The struggling starts.)

662
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:53,535
See? We're lucky not to be in there.

663
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:55,305
(Jong Kook shakes his head.)

664
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,630
(No one is giving in.)

665
00:24:58,633 --> 00:24:59,700
- It's in! - My finger.

666
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:00,945
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

667
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,615
Are you okay?

668
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,415
Her finger was already in, and I stuck the pirate in.

669
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:08,840
I...

670
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:10,410
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

671
00:25:10,412 --> 00:25:12,580
- Are you okay? - Her finger was already in,

672
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:14,140
but the pirate went all the way in.

673
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:15,295
Are you okay?

674
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,395
Gosh.

675
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,665
Seong Moon, are you okay?

676
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,120
- It's Ji Hyo. - It's Ji Hyo?

677
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,090
I thought it was Seong Moon.

678
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,060
(Ji Hyo sacrifices her finger.)

679
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,405
(Kwang Soo moves onto the finals.)

680
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:29,060
You can relax in the beginning.

681
00:25:29,064 --> 00:25:30,205
(It's the weaker members' turn.)

682
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:33,045
- Gosh. - Gosh.

683
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:34,970
(Haha attempts to win.)

684
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,970
Done!

685
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:38,615
(But he fails.)

686
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:39,970
So Min!

687
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:41,340
(The pirate pops back up, and Jae Seok wins.)

688
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:44,510
- Let me see. - So Min!

689
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:48,425
(Among the weaker members, Jae Seok moves onto the finals.)

690
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:51,765
(The mean Jae Seok versus the unlucky Kwang Soo)

691
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:54,120
The finals are going to be fun.

692
00:25:54,122 --> 00:25:56,190
- Seriously... - This is a problem.

693
00:25:56,191 --> 00:25:58,890
- It's going to be a mess. - It's going to be crazy.

694
00:25:58,894 --> 00:26:00,060
I have to win.

695
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:01,260
(It's a battle between two cheaters.)

696
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:02,760
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

697
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:04,900
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

698
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,530
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

699
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:07,600
Okay.

700
00:26:07,602 --> 00:26:09,045
(Kwang Soo goes first.)

701
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:16,455
(Who will win additional necessities?)

702
00:26:18,613 --> 00:26:22,095
(Kwang Soo's first try makes the pirate pop out.)

703
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,065
(Is this even possible?)

704
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:29,435
(Hi, Kwang Soo.)

705
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:33,905
(It's mine.)

706
00:26:36,832 --> 00:26:39,000
(What?)

707
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,170
(No...)

708
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,675
How is this possible?

709
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,140
At his first try?

710
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:51,255
They'll be running around all over the place. Get the jimmy jib ready.

711
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,125
Fly the drones too.

712
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,150
How did it pop out at the first try?

713
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,750
(No one knows who will win yet.)

714
00:26:57,752 --> 00:26:58,750
It's beginning.

715
00:26:58,753 --> 00:26:59,820
(The battle starts.)

716
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:01,320
He's being clever.

717
00:27:01,323 --> 00:27:03,435
(Jae Seok tries to distract Kwang Soo.)

718
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:08,065
(He hides among the staff members.)

719
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,490
(Kwang Soo is staying around the barrel.)

720
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,430
- Kwang Soo, to the right. - Where is he?

721
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:14,500
- To the right. - Where did he go?

722
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:15,715
(Where is he?)

723
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:17,515
Where did he go?

724
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,840
- To the right. - Where did he go?

725
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:20,840
Defend the right side.

726
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:21,985
(Kwang Soo doesn't see Jae Seok.)

727
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:24,615
(Looking around)

728
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:29,950
(Between them are two rows of staff members.)

729
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:34,465
(Jae Seok has to move while Kwang Soo is distracted.)

730
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,760
(There you are.)

731
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,060
(Jae Seok has been spotted.)

732
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:43,060
Hold on.

733
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:44,635
(It's a head-to-head match now.)

734
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:47,105
(Pushing)

735
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:49,770
There you go.

736
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:50,970
(Jae Seok gets to the barrel in just 3 steps.)

737
00:27:50,972 --> 00:27:52,685
(He looked like a grasshopper.)

738
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:57,555
(He successfully sticks the pirate in the barrel.)

739
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:00,280
- Jae Seok wins. - No!

740
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:01,850
- He didn't win! - I win!

741
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,255
- Yes! - Jae Seok.

742
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:06,765
He pushed the camera away.

743
00:28:07,422 --> 00:28:09,135
How did he find his way?

744
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,690
My defense was impenetrable.

745
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:14,505
Jae Seok wins. He gets to choose a necessity.

746
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:17,535
- Thank you. - It was cool.

747
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,300
The ramyeon set looks nice.

748
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,360
(3 prize candidates)

749
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:21,645
The ramyeon set would be the best.

750
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,470
Jae Seok would definitely choose the ramyeon set.

751
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:26,985
Among these three? The ramyeon set, obviously.

752
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,010
This is it.

753
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,615
- Jae Seok chose the ramyeon set. - Yes.

754
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,025
That's incredible.

755
00:28:33,481 --> 00:28:37,995
- Unbelievable. - Let's start Pick Me War now.

756
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,050
(What?)

757
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:41,565
(Drinking)

758
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,490
(That's my water.)

759
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:49,860
(The cheating hasn't stopped.)

760
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:53,200
(It's a mess to the end.)

761
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,200
(Snatching)

762
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:55,970
Hey! What are you doing?

763
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:58,070
I was thirsty!

764
00:28:58,073 --> 00:29:02,110
Gosh. He drank my water.

765
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,410
What can you do?

766
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:05,210
You can't steal others' stuff from now on.

767
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:07,480
- What? - You can't steal from now on.

768
00:29:07,482 --> 00:29:09,825
Only now?

769
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:12,620
You can't steal from now on, right? Okay.

770
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,765
(Cool)

771
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:16,435
You can make stir-fried ramyeon.

772
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:21,205
Let's start Isolated Race, Pick Me War.

773
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:24,730
There will be the first vote in an hour.

774
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:28,615
You can also use the snack bar.

775
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,215
I'll have to buy something.

776
00:29:30,672 --> 00:29:33,085
(They look around the snack bar first.)

777
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:34,540
How much is that?

778
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:36,010
(The snack bar has everything.)

779
00:29:36,011 --> 00:29:37,010
(The problem is the prices.)

780
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:39,225
A spoon and chopsticks cost 300 dollars?

781
00:29:39,681 --> 00:29:43,795
That's a rip-off. A boiled egg costs 500 dollars.

782
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:46,520
How many eggs can you get for 500 dollars?

783
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:48,220
- Just one. - Just one.

784
00:29:48,223 --> 00:29:50,235
You're a thief.

785
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:52,390
Electricity costs 200 dollars?

786
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:53,820
Why is it so expensive?

787
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:55,960
- You'll be broke afterwards. - When you eat ramyeon,

788
00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:59,000
- a spoon and chopsticks... - Do we have to buy them?

789
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,805
- Do we have to? - You have to buy them.

790
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:03,515
- Se Chan, do you want to share... - Bo Pil, you know me, right?

791
00:30:04,272 --> 00:30:06,770
We've known each other for a long time.

792
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:09,010
Everyone here has known him for a long time.

793
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,910
- Step back. - What are you doing right now?

794
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:12,980
- This is robbery. - Bo Pil, I'll pay you later.

795
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,840
Lend me the chopsticks.

796
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:17,495
- What are you doing? - You have to pay 300 dollars.

797
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:19,920
You're ripping us off.

798
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,890
If we report this to the news program,

799
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:25,390
you'll be arrested. 500 dollars...

800
00:30:25,393 --> 00:30:27,460
(A snack bar makes enormous profits.)

801
00:30:27,462 --> 00:30:29,305
(It's a rip-off.)

802
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:31,190
(Give me 200 dollars.)

803
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,800
(Behind this suspicious snack bar...)

804
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,005
(is a giant broadcasting station?)

805
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,070
Kimchi costs 300 dollars? We could even make some ourselves.

806
00:30:38,073 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm one of the richest members for now.

807
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:42,440
- I'm very rich. - So am I.

808
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:45,080
- You should thank me. - Seriously.

809
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,280
You should seriously vote for me.

810
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:49,280
- I will. - It's worth at least 500 dollars.

811
00:30:49,284 --> 00:30:50,950
It's worth 500 dollars.

812
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:52,665
Let me tell you something.

813
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,590
If someone gives me five votes, I'll write that person a promissory note.

814
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,890
(I'll write that person a promissory note.)

815
00:30:57,892 --> 00:30:59,905
- Haha! - Come to me.

816
00:31:00,261 --> 00:31:02,560
- I want to make a deal. - Me!

817
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:04,290
- Me! - I'll write you a promissory note.

818
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,400
- I'm here. - You can give up to 1,000 dollars.

819
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,870
I have food, so I don't have to buy anything.

820
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,030
You have to carry out what you write on the promissory notes.

821
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,470
If you don't, you'll be penalized.

822
00:31:12,474 --> 00:31:13,940
- Really? - You have to?

823
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:16,510
- You have to keep your promise. - That sounds good.

824
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:20,080
Why don't we give each other a vote right here?

825
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,580
- Good. - Okay.

826
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:22,850
(They give each other a vote.)

827
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:25,010
- Are you going to write my name? - Write my name first.

828
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:27,765
(So Min and Kwang Soo exchange votes.)

829
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:29,190
Why are you writing it in the corner?

830
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,260
- You'll scratch that later, right? - I always write this way.

831
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,665
Write, "Jeon So Min", big here.

832
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,775
(Coughing)

833
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:39,100
- You'll scratch that later. - Don't you see I'm coughing?

834
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,245
(I'm not in the mood for jokes.)

835
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:42,100
(I'm extremely ill.)

836
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,830
You're faking it.

837
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:46,740
You have to carry out what you write on the promissory notes.

838
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,510
You can change the name on your ballots...

839
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,410
before you throw them into the ballot box.

840
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,655
- Se Chan... - Come on.

841
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,980
- Why would you say that now? - Yang Se Chan.

842
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:56,325
It won't matter for me. That rule doesn't matter for me.

843
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:58,050
(They write down names on the ballot for the time being.)

844
00:31:58,052 --> 00:31:59,320
Let's go. Let's go back in.

845
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,520
(They enter the building for a one-hour break.)

846
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:03,635
Members with water and ramyeon are the wealthy ones.

847
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,405
My gosh, this is...

848
00:32:06,294 --> 00:32:08,360
(Wilby is the most useless item.)

849
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:10,205
No way. Look what I have.

850
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:13,200
Am I running a stationery store? Look at this, Haha.

851
00:32:13,201 --> 00:32:14,700
I bet you'll have the most fun.

852
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:15,900
(So Min Stationery Opens.)

853
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:18,315
I should've brought 2L of water.

854
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:21,185
But the most useful item here is the red ginseng.

855
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:23,355
I can drink this instead of water when I get thirsty.

856
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:25,810
- It will make you thirstier. - I'll drink it when I'm thirsty.

857
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:29,180
- That's the most useless item here. - I have wet wipes.

858
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,850
I have fire. No one can live without fire.

859
00:32:31,853 --> 00:32:33,150
I have fire too.

860
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:34,665
You have the portable stove.

861
00:32:34,722 --> 00:32:35,990
I can't spend any money.

862
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:37,290
- When would I need the fire? - I have a pot here too.

863
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:39,560
When you put this on the floor,

864
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:41,605
- it sucks in all the ants. - You can do that?

865
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,830
Come inside, mosquito.

866
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:46,445
(She uses the vacuum on Jong Kook.)

867
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:50,070
(Let's catch Jong Kook, the mosquito.)

868
00:32:50,071 --> 00:32:51,715
My gosh, this is so much fun.

869
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,685
Look at Jong Kook's face.

870
00:32:53,741 --> 00:32:55,185
Look at him.

871
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,955
She's cute.

872
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:59,080
(Come on.)

873
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,425
You didn't even look at her while saying that.

874
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:03,295
- "She's cute." - I got scared for a second.

875
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:04,695
Jong Kook, you lied, didn't you?

876
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,450
- He was looking at the ledger. - You didn't look at her.

877
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,265
He said that when he was looking at the ledger.

878
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,490
- Mosquito. - Hey, hey.

879
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:13,105
She's actually pressing on the button.

880
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:16,030
- She's pressing on it. - Wasn't that really dangerous?

881
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,390
It just zapped.

882
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,845
- Wait, my hair. - Is my hair burned?

883
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,700
- It doesn't work on people. - That's true.

884
00:33:20,702 --> 00:33:21,860
- It zapped? - Wait, my hair.

885
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:22,900
Wait, does it work?

886
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:23,930
(Buzzing)

887
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,685
It works. It works.

888
00:33:26,241 --> 00:33:29,840
(No way. It fully functions.)

889
00:33:29,844 --> 00:33:31,270
It works. It'll burn him.

890
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,525
I'm quite shocked.

891
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,325
- Did it work? - Why does that work on him?

892
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:35,950
It doesn't work.

893
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,250
- Maybe, he's not human. - You pressed it earlier.

894
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:38,720
- He must be a bug. - No, I didn't press it here.

895
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,965
I pressed it over there.

896
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,935
- Isn't that weirder? - But my hair...

897
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:45,690
You can get comfortable.

898
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:47,320
Now, you must cook ramyeon.

899
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:49,630
If you need to buy anything, use the convenience store.

900
00:33:49,631 --> 00:33:50,775
This...

901
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:54,045
Having this won't help me much.

902
00:33:54,102 --> 00:33:56,700
I saw a small space where there were a lot of animals.

903
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,470
(It is an animal farm.)

904
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,040
I'll put this in the lot.

905
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,700
- Will you donate it there? - Yes, I'll put this in there.

906
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,910
- Why would you donate that? - What?

907
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,210
Why would you do that?

908
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:07,225
Why wouldn't I? This is mine. I can do whatever I want, right?

909
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:08,385
Wait.

910
00:34:08,483 --> 00:34:10,195
You must return it to me when we're done.

911
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,555
Then you should buy it from me.

912
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,120
- Yes, you should buy it. - What?

913
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:14,465
- Buy it from me then. - Buy it.

914
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,620
I don't need this at all.

915
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,760
I have to bring this back if we need it for another episode.

916
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,090
(That's my Wilby.)

917
00:34:20,094 --> 00:34:22,275
- Then buy this from me. - How about this?

918
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:24,830
I'll buy it from you, but vote for me in exchange.

919
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:27,045
(He starts negotiating.)

920
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:29,870
- That's a nice deal. - You ought to comply with that.

921
00:34:29,871 --> 00:34:32,515
- Use your promissory note. - Give me 200 dollars check then.

922
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,510
Hey, he's a complete swindler.

923
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:41,540
No, he's not. The boiled egg costs 300 dollars.

924
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:44,650
- That's cheap. He should get 700. - I agree.

925
00:34:44,652 --> 00:34:46,450
A paper cup costs 300 dollars.

926
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:47,820
- Then I'm sorry, - You should buy something.

927
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:49,120
- but give me 300 dollars. - There you go.

928
00:34:49,123 --> 00:34:50,990
- What's happening? - 200 dollars won't cut it.

929
00:34:50,992 --> 00:34:52,290
After listening to them...

930
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:53,560
- But you have more money. - The paper cup...

931
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:55,060
- The paper cup costs 30 dollars. - You do.

932
00:34:55,063 --> 00:34:57,490
- One vote... - The boiled egg...

933
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,700
- Can I buy your vote for 300? - Pardon?

934
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:00,945
No, I'll buy it.

935
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll sell it to Seok Jin.

936
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:04,670
- No, no. - I'll sell it for 300.

937
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:07,585
- I'll give you 350 dollars. - Seok Jin.

938
00:35:07,842 --> 00:35:09,740
- Great. I'll take 350 dollars. - 350 dollars?

939
00:35:09,744 --> 00:35:11,510
- I believe that it's only right... - Okay.

940
00:35:11,512 --> 00:35:13,980
- that you take this giraffe. - Okay, okay.

941
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:17,150
Write on the note that you'll pay 350 dollars in exchange for 1 vote.

942
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:19,865
- Of course, I'll vote for him. - Please write that on it.

943
00:35:20,121 --> 00:35:21,820
(He's done issuing the check.)

944
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:23,335
- I'll give you my vote. - It's 200 dollars for 1.

945
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:26,905
- I'm sorry, but hold on. - Did you buy it?

946
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:28,505
- What did he write on it? - What?

947
00:35:28,663 --> 00:35:31,430
- You wrote 35 dollars on the check. - I did? I'm sorry. Sorry.

948
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:32,830
(He's flustered.)

949
00:35:32,834 --> 00:35:34,900
(He's shameless.)

950
00:35:34,902 --> 00:35:36,800
(He sneakily wrote 35 dollars.)

951
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,740
I'm sorry. I'm pretty bad with numbers. I'll fix it. I will.

952
00:35:39,741 --> 00:35:41,340
- You're such a jerk. - I will fix it.

953
00:35:41,342 --> 00:35:43,240
- I'm sorry. I'm bad with numbers. - Seriously.

954
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,210
- I've never done this before. - Should he be arrested for that?

955
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,380
- Really? - When would I have the chance?

956
00:35:47,382 --> 00:35:50,350
- No. I can't do this then. - I'm sorry.

957
00:35:50,351 --> 00:35:51,710
(The note is void as the seller is angry.)

958
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,150
I'll fix it. I'll issue a new one.

959
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:54,925
- He should go to prison for that. - I'll give it to you.

960
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,890
- I'm bad with numbers. - Make the zeros bigger.

961
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:58,135
- They're too small. - Okay.

962
00:35:58,393 --> 00:35:59,790
You're quite picky.

963
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:02,130
- I can't believe this. - I gave it to you. I did.

964
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,435
- You can't pull this trick on me. - I'm bad with numbers.

965
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:06,145
When would I have ever issued a promissory note?

966
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,115
- Seok Jin, how much is the ginseng? - My gosh, 350 dollars...

967
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:14,185
- Why are you ignoring it? - What?

968
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:16,955
- You saw the sketchbook. - I didn't ignore it.

969
00:36:17,478 --> 00:36:19,110
- She does weird stuff. - Why?

970
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:20,280
I should have some red ginseng.

971
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:24,110
She wrote a chain letter when she gave the sketchbook to me.

972
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:26,295
(She wrote a chain letter on the sketchbook?)

973
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:28,820
(One day before the shoot, So Min's self-tape)

974
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,265
I'll write a chain letter.

975
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:34,805
"This letter initially started in England..."

976
00:36:35,129 --> 00:36:39,445
(It took her 30 minutes to write a chain letter for Kwang Soo.)

977
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,545
This is bad luck. What is this?

978
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:45,270
- Seriously? - You have to write one too.

979
00:36:45,273 --> 00:36:47,140
You have to write one too. Or it'll bring back luck.

980
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:49,040
- I was going to ignore it. - That's right. You must write back.

981
00:36:49,043 --> 00:36:50,655
- Or you'll die. - You'll be in trouble then.

982
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:52,215
You'll be in trouble if you don't write one.

983
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,080
She told me to send this to 7 people to bring good luck for 7 years.

984
00:36:55,082 --> 00:36:56,750
You know, if you don't, you'll be unlucky, right?

985
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,750
- You should hurry. - He's going to send one to us.

986
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:01,720
(He's really writing it. How could he ignore this letter?)

987
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:05,805
(He forgets about the shoot and writes the letter for good luck.)

988
00:37:07,662 --> 00:37:09,005
The one who started this letter...

989
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,300
sent this to 7 people in the 1930s...

990
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,100
and won a two-million-dollars lottery.

991
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,070
- Right. - But the person was shot to death.

992
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,570
When the person ignored the letter, he was shot to death.

993
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:18,815
- He was assassinated. - Hey.

994
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,185
Don't go that far.

995
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:23,870
- Ignoring it brought him death. - Hey, how could you...

996
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,725
write the chain letter on the sketchbook?

997
00:37:26,314 --> 00:37:27,525
Se Chan.

998
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:30,750
How about a promissory note for a book?

999
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:32,565
- Can I see the cover of the book? - Okay.

1000
00:37:33,621 --> 00:37:34,720
That's great.

1001
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,665
It feels like this is an illegal dealing.

1002
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:39,360
- This book has good information. - Okay.

1003
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,920
In exchange, give me your vote.

1004
00:37:40,928 --> 00:37:42,330
- What is that? A book? - I'll put that in.

1005
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,575
Yes, it's a book.

1006
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,335
I really want that book.

1007
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,900
- Buy it for 50 dollars. - 50 dollars.

1008
00:37:46,901 --> 00:37:49,615
Write on the note that you'll buy it for 50 dollars and vote for me.

1009
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,115
You'll give me your vote.

1010
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,940
- Yes, right there. - My name?

1011
00:37:53,941 --> 00:37:56,210
- Hey, hold on. - You'll write my name.

1012
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,910
(He's shocked.)

1013
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,125
What's wrong with you?

1014
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:02,125
What's wrong with Jae Seok? Excuse me. Hey, look.

1015
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,350
My face is right here.

1016
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:05,620
- Is that so? - Come on.

1017
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
(This salesman doesn't even turn back.)

1018
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,120
You can give me 50 dollars for it.

1019
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:09,865
(Hitting with all his might)

1020
00:38:10,024 --> 00:38:12,290
(He hits Jae Seok's bottom.)

1021
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:13,760
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1022
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,120
I'm sure it hurt a bit.

1023
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,860
(You're fooling no one.)

1024
00:38:16,864 --> 00:38:18,230
He's holding it in. His face got red.

1025
00:38:18,232 --> 00:38:21,060
- He's pretending it didn't hurt. - He held it in. His face got red.

1026
00:38:21,068 --> 00:38:23,515
(He endures the pain because showing it would mean he lost.)

1027
00:38:24,572 --> 00:38:25,970
I have the dating horoscope for May.

1028
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,040
(It's inside the magazine.)

1029
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:28,800
- The dating horoscope for May. - Read the dating horoscope.

1030
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,010
Tell me if you want to hear it.

1031
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:31,910
- Read So Min's. - So Min?

1032
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,740
- There's one for the Year of Tiger. - Yes, it's our year.

1033
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,850
- She should pay to hear that. - Of course, she will.

1034
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,350
- It's 10 dollars. - You can read it for free.

1035
00:38:37,351 --> 00:38:38,510
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars?

1036
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,620
You should pay at least 10 dollars.

1037
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,980
- Can I hear mine? - But this is quite juicy.

1038
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:42,490
(He asks out of nowhere.)

1039
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,935
- You can't. - Why would you want to?

1040
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,360
- Why would you hear yours? - You can't hear yours.

1041
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,660
Seok Jin, what year were you born?

1042
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:49,105
- I was born in 1966. - 66.

1043
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,830
- The early 1966. - His year isn't in it.

1044
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,845
(The horoscope for 1966 isn't in the magazine.)

1045
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:54,945
1976 is the earliest.

1046
00:38:55,303 --> 00:38:56,300
1976 is the last year.

1047
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:58,370
(The one for his health might be more popular at his age.)

1048
00:38:58,372 --> 00:38:59,615
That's too harsh.

1049
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,785
Who wants to have cup noodles?

1050
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,915
- Hey, that. Se Chan. - Yes?

1051
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:07,985
If we combine our water, it'd be enough for the ramyeon.

1052
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:10,550
Should we join hands and make a business out of this?

1053
00:39:10,551 --> 00:39:12,465
Yours is 700 dollars, and mine is 500 dollars.

1054
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,220
- Really? - Then...

1055
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,365
- you should give him 200 dollars. - That's right. That's only fair.

1056
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,490
- Why? - Because...

1057
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,005
- Mine costs 700 dollars. - You said so yourself.

1058
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:22,160
- I should pay him 200 dollars? - What?

1059
00:39:22,163 --> 00:39:24,390
But who is this guy? Does he get a commission in the middle?

1060
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:26,545
(But who is this guy? Does he get a commission in the middle?)

1061
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,360
- Who is he? He gets commissions? - He's an agent.

1062
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,830
- Are you an agent? - Why does he raise the price?

1063
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:33,215
- Of course, I am. I'm an agent. - Are you the middle man or what?

1064
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:34,945
Jae Seok, you and I must work together.

1065
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,610
If we cook this, they'll want to have a bite.

1066
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:40,625
Issue a note that promises that you'll write my name.

1067
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,025
Okay.

1068
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,650
We're joining hands now.

1069
00:39:43,651 --> 00:39:44,710
(For the synergy effect, they cut a deal.)

1070
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,795
I have nothing to offer here.

1071
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:48,265
My gosh, So Min.

1072
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:50,435
I have nothing to offer here!

1073
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:53,305
- It's the same with me. Look. - I'll sell you this microphone.

1074
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:55,120
Kwang Soo, don't you want to cover your eyes?
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1075
00:39:55,129 --> 00:39:57,675
Why would I want to do that? I have to look around here.

1076
00:39:57,798 --> 00:40:01,260
- I'll give you a great price. - What? Why would I want that?

1077
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,500
It warms your eyes.

1078
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,530
We can cook both of them together.

1079
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:06,585
(Jong Kook ends up eating ramyeon out of hunger.)

1080
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,740
How much is it to boil water?

1081
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:10,210
(Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo spot Jong Kook eating ramyeon.)

1082
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:12,380
You should sell it. Why are you eating this?

1083
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,410
(And she eats Jong Kook's ramyeon.)

1084
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,380
- Why would I sell this? - You should sell it.

1085
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:17,450
Or you should eat only half of it.

1086
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:18,810
Then you should buy it from me.

1087
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:19,965
(What?)

1088
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,390
Why are you telling me to sell if you're not buying it from me?

1089
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,290
- You just gave some to me. - My gosh.

1090
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,490
(Kwang Soo got a piece of the ramyeon.)

1091
00:40:26,494 --> 00:40:28,920
I'll give you 10 dollars for letting me dip the noodles in the soup.

1092
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,430
- What? - Let me just dip the noodles in.

1093
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,190
- No, no. We can't do that. - I'll dip it in and take it out.

1094
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,230
- No, we can't do that. - 10 dollars.

1095
00:40:33,234 --> 00:40:34,860
- Just this piece. - A bit of seasoning is 10 dollars.

1096
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:36,070
- No. - Hey, this is ruined.

1097
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,875
- I have the seasoning over there. - Then forget it.

1098
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,585
It's over.

1099
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,815
You said you'll pay me for this, but you just keep on eating.

1100
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,180
You had enough now.

1101
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,880
(She's been eating for 5 minutes while pretending to care.)

1102
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:50,895
Since you had some, go away.

1103
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,120
She keeps on eating mine.

1104
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,220
- I'm just eating the crumbs. - My gosh.

1105
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:57,735
- I thought you were my wife. - Hey.

1106
00:40:58,392 --> 00:40:59,460
Hey.

1107
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,060
She nagged me about selling this.

1108
00:41:02,063 --> 00:41:04,475
- But she kept on eating. - But she kept eating?

1109
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,700
- All right. - I'll pour the water now.

1110
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,060
- Okay. - Why isn't the water boiling?

1111
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:10,430
- It's boiling, right? - Wait. I'll add the seasoning now.

1112
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:11,870
Can I dip it in the seasoning just once?

1113
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:13,270
That'll be 50 dollars.

1114
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,540
(You must pay for that.)

1115
00:41:14,542 --> 00:41:16,110
- My gosh, he's so petty. - No, listen.

1116
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,755
I have to survive too.

1117
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,425
Seok Jin.

1118
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,080
You don't need the seasoning, right?

1119
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,595
Jong Kook, you don't want the seasoning, right?

1120
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:24,250
- What? No. - The seasoning.

1121
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,310
- Wait. - Can I get it?

1122
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,720
- Come on. - Give the seasoning to me.

1123
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,380
Just because I shared my ramyeon with you doesn't mean...

1124
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,135
- Give the seasoning to me. - Give it to me, please.

1125
00:41:30,191 --> 00:41:31,490
- No, no. - Hey.

1126
00:41:31,492 --> 00:41:33,605
You should cut back on sodium. Just eat it plain.

1127
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:34,920
You gave him a block,

1128
00:41:34,929 --> 00:41:36,660
but you called me out when I ate the crumbs.

1129
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:39,645
- You ate more than that. - No, that's not true.

1130
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,300
- The crumbs... - I've been saving this piece.

1131
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,270
- You ate a lot of crumbs. - I've been saving this.

1132
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,915
Go back to your spot now. Go.

1133
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:46,140
- I got this earlier. - Kwang Soo.

1134
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,940
- Kwang Soo, your paper. - Sell it to me.

1135
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:49,085
I won't give you any.

1136
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:51,570
(Are they using Kwang Soo's letter as an oven mitt?)

1137
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:53,510
Jae Seok, what are you doing?

1138
00:41:53,514 --> 00:41:55,480
I was going to sell it.

1139
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:57,510
- Sell what? - You're in trouble.

1140
00:41:57,518 --> 00:41:58,710
- What happened? - You.

1141
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,620
Your life is over now.

1142
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,365
No, what do you mean?

1143
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,050
Do you know why President Kennedy got killed?

1144
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:06,705
You know what?

1145
00:42:06,794 --> 00:42:08,160
On this letter...

1146
00:42:08,162 --> 00:42:09,230
(What's wrong with tearing it a little?)

1147
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,275
You should never throw away or doodle on this letter.

1148
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,530
- He's right. - Really?

1149
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:14,945
It'll be fine.

1150
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,270
- It's okay. - You're in trouble.

1151
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,470
Hold this.

1152
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:20,800
- Goodness. - Line up for ramyeon, So Min.

1153
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,285
- How could he? - Seok Jin.

1154
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:24,070
The first ones in line can buy it cheaper.

1155
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:25,715
- Me. - Get in line.

1156
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,240
- Get in line over here. - Okay.

1157
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:30,195
Come to my left if you want to collaborate with me.

1158
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,550
- It's cheaper if you come first. - It should be.

1159
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:34,680
Is it 50 dollars?

1160
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:36,320
(Finally, ramyeon is ready.)

1161
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:38,535
- It smells so good. - It looks delicious.

1162
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,320
Who wants to eat it?

1163
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:42,760
Gosh, it smells so good.

1164
00:42:42,763 --> 00:42:44,275
It's great.

1165
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:47,160
I should bear it. How many rounds will we play?

1166
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:48,445
It's 50 dollars.

1167
00:42:48,502 --> 00:42:49,915
It looks so delicious.

1168
00:42:50,337 --> 00:42:51,430
We should sell it.

1169
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:52,430
(The looks and smell make it irresistible.)

1170
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:55,185
(He tastes it to advertise it.)

1171
00:42:55,743 --> 00:42:57,670
(It tastes amazing.)

1172
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,210
Haha, this is it.

1173
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:00,625
It changes my mood.

1174
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,525
Is it called oxytocin? I can feel it suddenly.

1175
00:43:02,683 --> 00:43:03,710
This is great.

1176
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,150
- Oxytocin. - What's oxytocin?

1177
00:43:05,152 --> 00:43:07,265
Isn't it something that's released?

1178
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,920
Isn't it adrenaline?

1179
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:11,090
That's when you're nervous.

1180
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,705
- Do you mean endorphins? - That's what I meant.

1181
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,030
Endorphins got released.

1182
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,830
That's really serious.

1183
00:43:17,832 --> 00:43:19,330
What's oxytocin?

1184
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,600
- I want that. - There's also oxytocin.

1185
00:43:20,601 --> 00:43:23,415
Oxytocin is a hormone to signal contractions of the womb.

1186
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:26,040
Really? I'm sorry.

1187
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,785
What did you say?

1188
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:30,910
It costs 10 dollars to dip the noodles in the soup.

1189
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:32,110
(Jae Seok keeps tasting it.)

1190
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:34,140
- There it is. - I'll give you 10 dollars.

1191
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,995
- Let's divide it in half. - Look at me.

1192
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,595
- I'll give you 10 dollars. - Really? Okay.

1193
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,680
Here are 10 dollars.

1194
00:43:40,688 --> 00:43:42,365
- It's to dip in the soup. - Here are 10 dollars.

1195
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:45,035
- Are you dipping the noodles? - I'll do it for you.

1196
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:46,890
You're spilling the seasoning powder.

1197
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:48,865
- They're dipped. - I'm giving you a lot.

1198
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,135
(Hitting)

1199
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:54,245
(He takes the whole bite.)

1200
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,415
(How dare you eat all of it?)

1201
00:43:58,372 --> 00:44:00,340
Spit them out.

1202
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:02,145
I paid for it.

1203
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:05,855
- He's a crook. - I'll cancel one.

1204
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,080
Stop it.

1205
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:08,285
Goodness.

1206
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:10,995
He gave me the whole bite.

1207
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:12,920
Goodness.

1208
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,520
I shouldn't have trusted him.

1209
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:16,365
You should have known better.

1210
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,460
(One hour of free time is over.)

1211
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,520
All right.

1212
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:21,560
(It's the first voting time.)

1213
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:24,390
The first voting will start.

1214
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:25,790
- Se Chan. - What shall we do?

1215
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:27,600
- I wrote your name. - I'll write yours too.

1216
00:44:27,601 --> 00:44:29,515
- Write my name once. - I will.

1217
00:44:30,537 --> 00:44:32,885
- Did you vote for me? - I'm about to.

1218
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:35,985
We're voting for each other, right?

1219
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:39,015
Where's my ballot?

1220
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:42,795
My ballot is missing.

1221
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,155
- Where did you put it? - Who took it?

1222
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:47,480
- For the last voting slot, - I'll sell it.

1223
00:44:47,488 --> 00:44:49,390
- I'll pay 50 dollars. - That's not what I mean.

1224
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,790
It's 1 by 1.

1225
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:51,990
- Listen. - Me.

1226
00:44:51,992 --> 00:44:53,705
- Write my name for 50 dollars. - 50 dollars.

1227
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,120
- Haha. - Right?

1228
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:57,675
- Really? - I'll pay 100 dollars for 1 vote.

1229
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,030
- What? - I'll sell it.

1230
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,375
- I'll write your name. - I will.

1231
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,630
If someone pays me 200 dollars,

1232
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:06,040
I'll write your name five times.

1233
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,340
- Really? - Yes.

1234
00:45:07,341 --> 00:45:08,785
(I'll write your name five times.)

1235
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,870
- I'll pay you. - Hurry up.

1236
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,180
- Really? - 200 dollars?

1237
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,540
- I'll pay you. - Is it really 200 dollars?

1238
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,795
- I'll pay you. - I'll vote for you five times.

1239
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,720
I'll take it, Jong Kook.

1240
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,465
- Really? - Haha.

1241
00:45:21,522 --> 00:45:23,365
That's why small businesses go bankrupt.

1242
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:25,150
- Jong Kook is... - He's a corporation.

1243
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,260
You can't compete against corporations.

1244
00:45:27,261 --> 00:45:28,860
- Hurry. - I'll pay you 250 dollars.

1245
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:31,390
- What? 250 dollars? - 250 dollars.

1246
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:33,000
- How about 400 dollars? - "400 dollars"?

1247
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,100
I can't pay that much.

1248
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,005
- Ji Hyo called 400 dollars. - 400 dollars.

1249
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,170
You have 30 seconds before the voting is over.

1250
00:45:38,172 --> 00:45:41,000
I can't find my ballot.

1251
00:45:41,008 --> 00:45:42,100
(Seok Jin can't find his ballot.)

1252
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:44,155
Where's my ballot?

1253
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,380
Who took my ballot?

1254
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,080
I have 50 dollars.

1255
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,480
(She brags about her promissory notes.)

1256
00:45:49,483 --> 00:45:52,495
- And Ji Hyo... - Where's my ballot?

1257
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,320
- What have you done? - Where did it go?

1258
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:57,235
- What's wrong? - Kwang Soo.

1259
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:01,060
(Write So Min's name on the sketchbook?)

1260
00:46:01,061 --> 00:46:03,130
- Kwang Soo. - What's wrong?

1261
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,775
How dare you, Kwang Soo?

1262
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:06,630
Come over here.

1263
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:07,860
I have three more votes left.

1264
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:10,870
- That's not what's important. - What's this?

1265
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:13,270
- I'll write it on my sketchbook. - Where's my ballot?

1266
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,100
Give it back to me.

1267
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,610
- Come on. - What's wrong?

1268
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:19,010
- Why did you write that? - Where's my ballot?

1269
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,155
Wait a minute.

1270
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:22,240
- What? I don't have it. - Write my name down.

1271
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:24,250
- Write my name. - I already voted.

1272
00:46:24,251 --> 00:46:26,365
Where's my ballot?

1273
00:46:27,488 --> 00:46:29,890
- Give me one more. - That wasn't the deal.

1274
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,590
You thieves, where's my ballot!

1275
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:34,060
I'll write your name if you pay me 100 dollars.

1276
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,160
- That's mine. - No.

1277
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:36,430
- Five. - What is it?

1278
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,730
- Listen. - I'll pay you.

1279
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,090
- I'll vote for you for 100 dollars. - 4.

1280
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:41,300
- I'll vote for you for 100 dollars. - 3.

1281
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:42,300
(The 1st voting is over.)

1282
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:44,030
- Here you go. - My goodness.

1283
00:46:44,038 --> 00:46:45,230
Where's my ballot?

1284
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,840
Money is important,

1285
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,000
but everyone is making strange deals.

1286
00:46:49,009 --> 00:46:50,615
Can we change whom we voted?

1287
00:46:51,678 --> 00:46:53,880
- Do you have another ballot? - Isn't it Seok Jin's?

1288
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:55,640
- Where did it go? - Isn't it Seok Jin's?

1289
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:57,410
- Isn't this yours? - It's the sketchbook.

1290
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:59,295
My goodness.

1291
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,380
- Here are the promissory notes. - Where was it?

1292
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:02,990
- The voting is over. - Didn't he have it?

1293
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,490
I got a promissory note.

1294
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:07,960
Wait, why did Seok Jin write Kwang Soo's name only?

1295
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,390
(Why did Seok Jin write Kwang Soo's name only?)

1296
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:11,830
- Hey, you. - What?

1297
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,360
- You're a crook. - You misunderstood.

1298
00:47:14,368 --> 00:47:16,400
- This isn't mine. - I thought it was a dream.

1299
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:18,170
- You misunderstood. - This isn't real.

1300
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:21,040
- I don't know when it happened. - This is fake.

1301
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:23,685
Your bag was on my shoulder.

1302
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:28,425
(While Seok Jin and Kwang Soo were fighting...)

1303
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:31,855
(Seok Jin turned around and gave up.)

1304
00:47:35,522 --> 00:47:37,935
(What happened?)

1305
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:40,105
(He smiles.)

1306
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,775
(Kwang Soo took the ballot from Seok Jin's bag.)

1307
00:47:45,799 --> 00:47:46,975
What's this?

1308
00:47:49,203 --> 00:47:52,870
(Then he voted on behalf of Seok Jin.)

1309
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:53,900
What are you doing?

1310
00:47:53,907 --> 00:47:55,740
- Where's mine? - What are you doing?

1311
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:57,010
Where's my bag?

1312
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,125
(He finished voting with boldness.)

1313
00:48:01,348 --> 00:48:02,625
Here it is.

1314
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,465
(Kwang Soo committed a crime without much effort.)

1315
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,880
(How dare you?)

1316
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,790
- Goodness! - It was around my neck.

1317
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,490
Your bag was hanging on my neck.

1318
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,360
(It's not a big deal.)

1319
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:17,190
How is this possible? How could he steal my ballot?

1320
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:19,330
(They submit their ballots.)

1321
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,345
- I'll announce the result. - Okay.

1322
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:22,870
This is important.

1323
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,530
(The voting result is announced.)

1324
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:28,240
The one with the most votes during the first round...

1325
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,655
- It's Jae Seok. - It's Kwang Soo.

1326
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,140
It's Ji Hyo with 10 votes.

1327
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,025
- What? - How?

1328
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,450
Ji Hyo got 10 votes.

1329
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:39,250
She could have gotten 11,

1330
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:41,265
but Haha misspelled her name.

1331
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,620
That's why she got 10 votes.

1332
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,950
She won't lose at all.

1333
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,760
- Of course not. - I'm jealous.

1334
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,205
The 2nd most number of votes was 7.

1335
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,230
- It was Kwang Soo. - Really?

1336
00:48:51,231 --> 00:48:53,130
Seok Jin voted him five times.

1337
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,560
I didn't. Kwang Soo voted for himself.

1338
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:57,470
- I didn't steal it. - Stop kidding.

1339
00:48:57,471 --> 00:48:58,530
I swear.

1340
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:01,000
Next is Haha with six votes.

1341
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:02,185
- All right. - See?

1342
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:03,970
Jae Seok received five votes.

1343
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:05,670
I only got five votes.

1344
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:06,880
Jae Seok bought a lot.

1345
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:09,080
Next is Seok Jin with four votes.

1346
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:10,750
(Seok Jin places 5th.)

1347
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,195
One vote made a difference.

1348
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:13,420
Next is...

1349
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,320
(Only three members remain.)

1350
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,290
(One of them is last.)

1351
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,790
The numbers tied.

1352
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,705
So Min and Se Chan received three votes.

1353
00:49:21,562 --> 00:49:24,190
(The youngest members place 6th.)

1354
00:49:24,198 --> 00:49:25,830
Is Jong Kook last?

1355
00:49:25,832 --> 00:49:27,545
Jong Kook received one vote.

1356
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,460
- Hey. - You placed last.

1357
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,030
- Wait a minute. - What?

1358
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,830
Didn't you vote for me?

1359
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:34,885
(Didn't you say that a while ago?)

1360
00:49:34,908 --> 00:49:37,970
I did vote for you, but you gave your votes away.

1361
00:49:37,978 --> 00:49:39,415
Is that why?

1362
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,625
Isn't that obvious?

1363
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:43,850
- What I mean is... - Okay.

1364
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:45,595
It's because of the promissory note.

1365
00:49:45,652 --> 00:49:48,120
You have two more rounds of voting.

1366
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,850
- The tables may turn. - Did I only get three?

1367
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,235
(Who will be penalized?)

1368
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,560
(The main mission starts.)

1369
00:49:55,562 --> 00:49:56,975
Why are there squeaky hammers?

1370
00:49:58,232 --> 00:49:59,600
(There are 8 squeaky hammers on 8 chairs.)

1371
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,900
Here's what I expect.

1372
00:50:01,902 --> 00:50:04,670
The game will get messy.

1373
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,240
- It will be. - You're right.

1374
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,700
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1375
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,610
(Kwang Soo is startled.)

1376
00:50:10,611 --> 00:50:12,410
- Wait a minute. - What is it?

1377
00:50:12,412 --> 00:50:14,080
I saw what happened.

1378
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:17,310
You were about to sit here until you saw Jong Kook next to you.

1379
00:50:17,317 --> 00:50:18,995
Why did you run away?

1380
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,320
- Sit down. - No.

1381
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,925
No, it was because of the squeaky hammer.

1382
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:24,490
(A moment ago)

1383
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:26,960
(Is Jong Kook sitting here?)

1384
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,075
(I should avoid the seat next to him.)

1385
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:34,300
He was going to sit here, but when Jong Kook sat down...

1386
00:50:34,301 --> 00:50:36,870
- No. - That's wrong.

1387
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,170
- Go back to the seat. - You can't read my mind.

1388
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:40,900
(Don't read my mind.)

1389
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:42,240
- Goodness. - Enjoy it if you can't avoid it.

1390
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:44,115
Enjoy it if you can't avoid it.

1391
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:47,380
Before the second round of voting,

1392
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,950
you get a chance to win two additional voting slots.

1393
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:52,450
(A chance to win two additional voting slots)

1394
00:50:52,452 --> 00:50:53,880
- 2? - 2 additional?

1395
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:55,180
(This mission is important.)

1396
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,320
- This is good. - It's a good chance.

1397
00:50:56,323 --> 00:50:58,190
We can sell it.

1398
00:50:58,191 --> 00:50:59,250
- Right. - We can sell it.

1399
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,860
You get a chance to win two additional voting slots.

1400
00:51:01,862 --> 00:51:04,375
Let's start Famous Line Number 3.

1401
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:08,145
- "Famous Line Number 3"? - "Famous Line Number 3"?

1402
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:11,770
Listen to famous lines from three movies that play simultaneously.

1403
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,000
You win if you guess the movie titles correctly.

1404
00:51:14,007 --> 00:51:17,010
The member to answer the most wins two additional voting slots.

1405
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:19,780
However, if you say the wrong answer,

1406
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,680
the ones sitting next to you will hit you with the squeaky hammer.

1407
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,750
- They'll hit you with the hammer. - From both sides?

1408
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:27,620
- Is it the one on the right? - Is it both?

1409
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:30,350
Whether it's the left or the right is the most important.

1410
00:51:30,357 --> 00:51:32,490
- This is what I think. - Decide by majority rule.

1411
00:51:32,492 --> 00:51:35,465
Do you hit the person on the left or on the right?

1412
00:51:35,862 --> 00:51:37,530
Let me change my seat.

1413
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:39,230
We should play a game to determine the seats.

1414
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,500
I'll give you my seat for 300 dollars.

1415
00:51:41,501 --> 00:51:42,800
- 300 dollars? - Yes.

1416
00:51:42,803 --> 00:51:46,815
Just bear it with your body. You won't die.

1417
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:50,570
Of course, I shouldn't die.

1418
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:51,710
You can buy my spot for 300 dollars.

1419
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:53,580
How hard are you going to hit me?

1420
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,080
I'll keep it controlled so that it can still air.

1421
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,695
Try hitting the floor so that we know.

1422
00:51:57,851 --> 00:51:59,350
I'll keep it controlled like this.

1423
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:00,380
(The sound is so loud.)

1424
00:52:00,387 --> 00:52:01,420
300 dollars, you said?

1425
00:52:01,421 --> 00:52:05,095
(Kwang Soo wants to buy So Min's spot.)

1426
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:07,560
- Seriously? - That's a good idea.

1427
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:10,930
Don't worry, Kwang Soo. It just makes a loud sound.

1428
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:13,530
Maybe you're right. Try hitting my head.

1429
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:15,100
- See? - 300 dollars.

1430
00:52:15,102 --> 00:52:18,770
(It hurts.)

1431
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:22,145
It seemed like your head got a dent.

1432
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:24,810
- It just makes a loud sound. - His head got a dent.

1433
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:26,710
- Is it a real hammer? - No.

1434
00:52:26,713 --> 00:52:28,885
- You've become shorter. - Let's do it like this.

1435
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:31,310
Let's play rock-paper-scissors outside...

1436
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:33,365
and decide who sits where.

1437
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,520
- Okay. - What do you think?

1438
00:52:35,522 --> 00:52:36,520
That sounds great.

1439
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:40,235
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1440
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:42,920
(Kwang Soo, Jong Kook, Jae Seok, So Min, and Ji Hyo win.)

1441
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:44,730
- We're divided. - We're divided.

1442
00:52:44,731 --> 00:52:47,000
- Scissors. - Okay.

1443
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,970
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1444
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,470
(Se Chan is at the bottom.)

1445
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:53,615
Gosh, I'm at the bottom.

1446
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:56,910
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1447
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,370
- I'm second to last. - Please step back.

1448
00:52:59,379 --> 00:53:01,080
- Let's go in 1 by 1. - I'm 3rd to last.

1449
00:53:01,081 --> 00:53:03,850
Why do I get to go first only in situations like this?

1450
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,095
We haven't decided on the direction yet.

1451
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:07,320
I'm going in.

1452
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,120
(So Min, Kwang Soo, Jong Kook,)

1453
00:53:09,122 --> 00:53:10,850
(Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Haha, Seok Jin, Se Chan)

1454
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:12,090
I'll sit here.

1455
00:53:12,092 --> 00:53:13,535
(The 2nd seat)

1456
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
(Let me see.)

1457
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:17,590
Be careful. Don't come here.

1458
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,190
Don't come here.

1459
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,200
I don't want you! Go away.

1460
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,205
- Number three, please come in. - I don't want you.

1461
00:53:23,737 --> 00:53:25,670
(It's the man Kwang Soo is determined to avoid.)

1462
00:53:25,672 --> 00:53:28,200
There are many empty seats.

1463
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:29,440
(You're not sitting next to me, are you?)

1464
00:53:29,443 --> 00:53:30,410
(You brat.)

1465
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,855
Why did you win?

1466
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,340
Hold on.

1467
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:37,450
Why did you win?

1468
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:39,820
He has a point.

1469
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,820
What did we do?

1470
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:43,435
The problem is that Jong Kook is right after you.

1471
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,890
- What did we do? - Hold on.

1472
00:53:44,891 --> 00:53:47,620
Aren't the winners supposed to sit later?

1473
00:53:47,627 --> 00:53:50,630
(Now that I think of it...)

1474
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,290
- But... - What are we supposed to do?

1475
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:55,845
What are we supposed to do? What's the best way?

1476
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,670
What should we do?

1477
00:53:57,671 --> 00:53:59,470
- I'm in second place. - Then you can sit later.

1478
00:53:59,473 --> 00:54:01,245
You can sit later.

1479
00:54:01,308 --> 00:54:03,410
- The winners will sit later. - The winners will sit later.

1480
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,210
- The winners will sit later. - Okay.

1481
00:54:05,212 --> 00:54:06,610
- You're at the bottom, right? - Yes.

1482
00:54:06,613 --> 00:54:08,040
- You sit down first. - Okay.

1483
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:10,550
Where's the chair? Okay, I'm done.

1484
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,750
I have no choice. It's weird.

1485
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:14,125
This is not bad.

1486
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,765
I'll sit here.

1487
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,090
It's my turn, right?

1488
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:19,390
Se Chan is scary.

1489
00:54:19,392 --> 00:54:21,560
(Jae Seok, Jong Kook, Kwang Soo, and So Min are left.)

1490
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:23,530
- Then... - Okay.

1491
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,390
It's the same.

1492
00:54:25,398 --> 00:54:27,700
(It's the same as before.)

1493
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,845
It's the same.

1494
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:33,015
(What?)

1495
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,200
If you sit here...

1496
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:36,640
(Among the remaining three seats,)

1497
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:40,840
(Jong Kook chooses the middle one.)

1498
00:54:40,847 --> 00:54:42,480
(Kwang Soo has to sit next to Jong Kook.)

1499
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:44,650
This is so funny. I love it.

1500
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:47,120
- It's the same. - What can we do?

1501
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,620
- What can we do? - You have no choice.

1502
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:51,590
Should the winners sit first?

1503
00:54:51,591 --> 00:54:54,160
(It's confusing.)

1504
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,735
Get out, all of you! I'm in second place.

1505
00:54:58,031 --> 00:55:00,860
- The winners should... - Let's try one last time.

1506
00:55:00,867 --> 00:55:02,600
The winners will sit first one last time.

1507
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:04,015
I'll sit at the end.

1508
00:55:04,771 --> 00:55:06,740
The winners should sit first.

1509
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,140
Are you sure?

1510
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:10,555
It's the same. So Min, you go first.

1511
00:55:11,011 --> 00:55:12,010
This is strange.

1512
00:55:12,012 --> 00:55:13,110
(So Min and Kwang Soo go first again.)

1513
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,325
- I'll sit here. - Okay.

1514
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:18,395
(What should I do?)

1515
00:55:18,852 --> 00:55:20,065
What should I do?

1516
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,825
Sit at the end.

1517
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:23,490
(He sits at the end.)

1518
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,250
It's my turn, right?

1519
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,765
(It's my turn, right?)

1520
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,530
(He sits next to Kwang Soo.)

1521
00:55:31,531 --> 00:55:34,905
(Go away!)

1522
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:36,970
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1523
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,675
- What? - There are many seats.

1524
00:55:42,242 --> 00:55:43,610
There are many seats.

1525
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,210
- I want to sit here. - Why me?

1526
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:47,725
- Why me? - I want to sit here.

1527
00:55:47,948 --> 00:55:50,510
- Sit here. - Sit there, Kwang Soo.

1528
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:52,850
- You have no choice. - I'll sit here.

1529
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:54,380
(Jae Seok)

1530
00:55:54,387 --> 00:55:56,720
- That's my seat. - Ji Hyo's next to So Min.

1531
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:58,835
Seok Jin is next to me again.

1532
00:55:59,459 --> 00:56:01,560
This spot is terrible.

1533
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:02,705
(The others come in.)

1534
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:05,630
Isn't it almost the same as before?

1535
00:56:05,632 --> 00:56:08,100
(If we sit like this...)

1536
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:11,015
- It's almost the same. - Nothing much has changed.

1537
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:13,685
He's sitting between the nasty members.

1538
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,010
Let's decide on the direction now.

1539
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,110
Left, please.

1540
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:22,240
Why don't the two at the ends play rock-paper-scissors?

1541
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:24,350
- Good. - If So Min wins, this way.

1542
00:56:24,351 --> 00:56:27,765
(If So Min wins, each member will get hit by the one sitting right.)

1543
00:56:27,821 --> 00:56:29,120
- If Kwang Soo wins, this way. - Okay.

1544
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:31,295
- Right? - Okay.

1545
00:56:32,892 --> 00:56:35,060
- I have to win. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1546
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:36,060
I'll throw rock.

1547
00:56:36,062 --> 00:56:37,435
(If Kwang Soo wins, he can hit Jong Kook.)

1548
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:39,830
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1549
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:42,800
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1550
00:56:42,802 --> 00:56:45,570
Okay! So Min!

1551
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,940
(Because he trusted So Min and lost, Kwang Soo will be hit by Jong Kook.)

1552
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:50,870
- Unbelievable. - Okay!

1553
00:56:50,877 --> 00:56:52,555
- Nothing changes for me. - Okay.

1554
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:54,880
So Min, you shouldn't be too happy.

1555
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:56,080
You'll be hit by Kwang Soo.

1556
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:57,595
(You'll be hit by Kwang Soo.)

1557
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,220
- That's right. - That's right.

1558
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:02,680
So Min, don't worry. He won't be able to hit you hard.

1559
00:57:02,689 --> 00:57:05,750
(So Min, don't worry. He won't be able to hit you hard.)

1560
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:10,030
- He won't be. - His legs will fail him.

1561
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,830
(He'll fall.)

1562
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:14,360
Kwang Soo will struggle for a while.

1563
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,770
Here goes the first question.

1564
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,370
You'll hear lines from three movies.

1565
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:20,400
- We just need to get it right. - That's right.

1566
00:57:20,407 --> 00:57:22,840
- We can say the right answer. - We can say the right answer.

1567
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:25,570
Play the movies.

1568
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:26,810
(The first question)

1569
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:29,140
(What are the 3 films?)

1570
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:32,150
(What is this?)

1571
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:33,620
(What are the 3 films?)

1572
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,625
Answer.

1573
00:57:37,857 --> 00:57:41,760
(We haven't even heard everything. Does he know all 3 titles?)

1574
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:43,360
- You have to say all 3 titles. - You have to say all 3 titles.

1575
00:57:43,363 --> 00:57:44,830
(You have to say all 3 titles.)

1576
00:57:44,831 --> 00:57:47,000
- All 3 titles? I'm sorry. - Hit him.

1577
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,900
(He thought he could say only one title.)

1578
00:57:48,902 --> 00:57:50,630
- I'm sorry. - You should hit him.

1579
00:57:50,637 --> 00:57:52,870
- Se Chan, you should hit him. - Jong Kook should have said...

1580
00:57:52,872 --> 00:57:55,200
- all three titles. - Yes.

1581
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:58,655
Serves your right.

1582
00:57:59,012 --> 00:58:01,380
Hit me.

1583
00:58:01,381 --> 00:58:02,525
What?

1584
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:04,210
I don't want to say it.

1585
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:06,820
Jong Kook can't hit you. Just hit him.

1586
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,920
- Okay. - Yes.

1587
00:58:07,921 --> 00:58:10,590
(Se Chan hits Jong Kook.)

1588
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:12,335
Hold on.

1589
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:13,760
(It was pretty hard.)

1590
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,560
- The direction won't change, right? - Good.

1591
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:18,330
Se Chan looked like Thor.

1592
00:58:18,331 --> 00:58:19,730
- The direction won't change, right? - Good.

1593
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:22,000
- The direction won't change, right? - No.

1594
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:23,770
- It won't change. - You never know.

1595
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,370
I have nothing to do with it.

1596
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:28,040
Let's try again. Play the movies.

1597
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,040
(The first question)

1598
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:36,080
(What are the 3 films?)

1599
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:40,195
(Wait. I think I hear something.)

1600
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,020
- I need to figure 1 more out. - Just 1...

1601
00:58:42,021 --> 00:58:44,535
I just need to figure one more out.

1602
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:46,550
Answer.

1603
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,260
(Answer)

1604
00:58:49,262 --> 00:58:51,335
Well... I take it back.

1605
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:53,230
Hold on.

1606
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,505
(Haha hits Jae Seok.)

1607
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,805
- You can't take it back. - Why did you hit me?

1608
00:58:57,137 --> 00:58:59,675
- I take it back. - You can't take it back.

1609
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:01,240
- What was that? - I take it back.

1610
00:59:01,241 --> 00:59:03,385
- You can't. - Let's try again.

1611
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,455
Play the movies.

1612
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:08,240
(The first question)

1613
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:09,580
(What are the 3 films?)

1614
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:11,050
Answer!

1615
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:13,195
(I really know this time.)

1616
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:15,720
"The Face Reader", "Assassination", and "No. 3".

1617
00:59:15,722 --> 00:59:16,950
("The Face Reader", "Assassination", and "No. 3")

1618
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:18,150
"No. 3"?

1619
00:59:18,158 --> 00:59:21,127
(Is "No. 3" included?)

1620
00:59:21,127 --> 00:59:21,165
Play the movies.
(Is "No. 3" included?)

1621
00:59:21,165 --> 00:59:23,060
Play the movies.

1622
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:25,865
(The first question)

1623
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:27,200
(What are the 3 films?)

1624
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,668
Answer!

1625
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:30,804
(I really know this time.)

1626
00:59:30,837 --> 00:59:33,339
"The Face Reader", "Assassination", and "No. 3".

1627
00:59:33,339 --> 00:59:34,574
("The Face Reader", "Assassination", and "No. 3")

1628
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:35,775
"No. 3"?

1629
00:59:35,775 --> 00:59:38,778
(Is "No. 3" included?)

1630
00:59:39,312 --> 00:59:40,680
- No? - Answer!

1631
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,415
(Jae Seok is wrong.)

1632
00:59:42,415 --> 00:59:44,350
- Answer! - "No. 3" is wrong.

1633
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:46,820
- I thought it was "No. 3". - Answer!

1634
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,289
- Answer! - I thought it was "No. 3".

1635
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:51,224
- It wasn't "No. 3"? - No.

1636
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:54,627
"The Admiral", "Assassination", and "The Face Reader".

1637
00:59:54,627 --> 00:59:56,462
("The Admiral", "Assassination", and "The Face Reader".)

1638
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:58,464
(Wrong)

1639
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:02,168
- Answer! - He should be hit.

1640
01:00:02,168 --> 01:00:05,305
(It's time.)

1641
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:06,472
(Scared)

1642
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:07,841
Hold on.

1643
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:10,643
- I know it from "X-Man". - Me too.

1644
01:00:13,479 --> 01:00:14,480
(Kwang Soo's ear is smashed.)

1645
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,615
That was awful.

1646
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:17,350
(Kwang Soo's ear is smashed.)

1647
01:00:17,851 --> 01:00:20,687
- He hit Kwang Soo's ear. - He got hit on the ear?

1648
01:00:20,687 --> 01:00:25,491
(Kwang Soo pays for what he did during the first vote.)

1649
01:00:25,525 --> 01:00:27,093
Is your cochlea okay?

1650
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:29,495
(Clapping)

1651
01:00:29,696 --> 01:00:31,564
Kwang Soo.

1652
01:00:31,564 --> 01:00:33,066
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1653
01:00:33,466 --> 01:00:35,735
- I hit his head. - What is this?

1654
01:00:35,969 --> 01:00:37,937
Mosquitos?

1655
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:40,106
I hit his head.

1656
01:00:40,306 --> 01:00:43,576
- I don't know the other one. - The other one is hard.

1657
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:45,678
You got "Assassination" and "The Face Reader" right.

1658
01:00:45,678 --> 01:00:47,380
(The other one is hard to figure out.)

1659
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:51,084
I have six Japanese bullets in my body.

1660
01:00:51,084 --> 01:00:55,388
I got shot while assassinating Terauchi in Gyeongseong in 1911.

1661
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:58,191
Do you think I'll become the king?

1662
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:02,528
Why aren't you answering?

1663
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:05,665
- I can't figure out the other one. - Play the movies.

1664
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:08,067
(They just need to find out the last movie.)

1665
01:01:08,067 --> 01:01:09,836
(What are the 3 films?)

1666
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,505
Can you mute Lee Jung Jae's lines?

1667
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,640
(Let me hear the last one.)

1668
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:14,807
(What are the 3 films?)

1669
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:17,810
- Answer. - So Min?

1670
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,413
(So Min answers.)

1671
01:01:20,613 --> 01:01:22,215
I don't want to get hit.

1672
01:01:22,315 --> 01:01:23,416
(Say it.)

1673
01:01:23,416 --> 01:01:24,717
What...

1674
01:01:25,385 --> 01:01:27,787
"Assassination", "The Face Reader", and "Architecture 101".

1675
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:29,622
("Assassination", "The Face Reader", and "Architecture 101")

1676
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:36,296
(Is the last film "Architecture 101"?)

1677
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:38,398
(She's right.)

1678
01:01:38,398 --> 01:01:40,133
- "Architecture 101". - It was "Architecture 101"?

1679
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:41,668
- What part? - Which one?

1680
01:01:42,001 --> 01:01:44,304
It's the kissing part.

1681
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:47,140
They mix.

1682
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,741
One at a time.

1683
01:01:49,275 --> 01:01:50,610
You rub them.

1684
01:01:51,511 --> 01:01:53,146
Just rub them. Rub!

1685
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:54,781
It's fantastic.

1686
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:57,216
This is kissing.

1687
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:00,186
"They mix." The part about kissing.

1688
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:03,289
It was. I heard it too.

1689
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:04,624
I tried to listen, but suddenly,

1690
01:02:04,624 --> 01:02:06,025
"Do you think I'll become the king?"

1691
01:02:06,025 --> 01:02:09,162
("Do you think I'll become the king?")

1692
01:02:09,162 --> 01:02:10,730
"There are seven."

1693
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:13,399
That's all I heard. That's all I could hear.

1694
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:15,001
"There are two bullets in my body."

1695
01:02:15,001 --> 01:02:16,869
That's all I heard.

1696
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:19,138
Good job, So Min. I would have never gotten this right.

1697
01:02:19,305 --> 01:02:21,641
- Here's the next video. - Okay.

1698
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,009
Play, please.

1699
01:02:23,009 --> 01:02:28,381
(What are the 3 films?)

1700
01:02:28,381 --> 01:02:31,584
(What are they? I have no clue.)

1701
01:02:31,584 --> 01:02:32,952
I have no idea.

1702
01:02:33,786 --> 01:02:36,155
- This is so confusing. - Answer.

1703
01:02:36,155 --> 01:02:37,423
(Kwang Soo shouts out.)

1704
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:38,658
Really?

1705
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:40,526
(Do you know?)

1706
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:41,761
It's too late. You have to say it.

1707
01:02:41,761 --> 01:02:42,929
(He's ready.)

1708
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:44,230
- You have to do it. - You're done.

1709
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:45,932
- I can't cancel, right? - No.

1710
01:02:46,265 --> 01:02:49,736
"The Priests", "The Wailing", "Along with the Gods".

1711
01:02:49,736 --> 01:02:51,637
("The Priests", "The Wailing", "Along with the Gods".)

1712
01:02:51,637 --> 01:02:56,275
(Will he be able to avoid Jong Kook's squeaky hammer?)

1713
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:57,477
"Along with the Gods"?

1714
01:02:57,477 --> 01:03:00,213
(He's wrong.)

1715
01:03:00,213 --> 01:03:01,481
All right.

1716
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:03,850
- This is fun to watch. - This is why we do this.

1717
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:05,385
Say hi to the deities for me.

1718
01:03:05,718 --> 01:03:07,020
That wasn't it.

1719
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:10,089
(He takes a full swing.)

1720
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:11,257
Why does it sound different?

1721
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:13,292
- It sounds different. - It was a thud.

1722
01:03:13,292 --> 01:03:15,128
(He can't speak now.)

1723
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,263
It's not that bad. It doesn't hurt.

1724
01:03:17,263 --> 01:03:20,266
Kwang Soo was about to say that it hurt,

1725
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,502
and Jong Kook said, "It doesn't hurt."

1726
01:03:22,502 --> 01:03:24,504
It's not that bad. It doesn't hurt.

1727
01:03:24,504 --> 01:03:26,806
It's okay. Don't give the wrong idea to the viewers.

1728
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:28,107
Tell them.

1729
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:30,243
- It was strong. - Answer.

1730
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:31,611
"The Priests",

1731
01:03:31,844 --> 01:03:33,146
"The Wailing",

1732
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:34,714
and "Train to Busan".

1733
01:03:34,714 --> 01:03:37,216
("The Priests", "The Wailing", and "Train to Busan")

1734
01:03:37,216 --> 01:03:39,218
(He's wrong.)

1735
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:41,921
- That was close. - That was.

1736
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:44,524
You got two right.

1737
01:03:44,524 --> 01:03:45,758
Exactly.

1738
01:03:45,758 --> 01:03:48,027
I know it's "The Priests" and "The Wailing".

1739
01:03:48,027 --> 01:03:49,362
I can't hear the last one.

1740
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:51,764
- It sounds like a similar genre. - Can we hear it again?

1741
01:03:51,831 --> 01:03:53,132
Play the films.

1742
01:03:53,132 --> 01:03:55,001
(Second question gets played again.)

1743
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:59,672
(What are the 3 films?)

1744
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:01,407
Answer.

1745
01:04:01,407 --> 01:04:02,408
(What? Does she really know?)

1746
01:04:02,408 --> 01:04:04,143
Who's the female voice?

1747
01:04:04,143 --> 01:04:05,511
"A Tale of Two Sisters "...

1748
01:04:05,978 --> 01:04:07,180
and...

1749
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,615
(That was "A Tale of Two Sisters"?)

1750
01:04:09,615 --> 01:04:11,684
"The Priests" and "Train to Busan".

1751
01:04:11,684 --> 01:04:13,686
("A Tale of Two Sisters", "The Priests", "Train to Busan")

1752
01:04:13,686 --> 01:04:14,987
(She's wrong.)

1753
01:04:14,987 --> 01:04:16,189
I'm dead.

1754
01:04:16,989 --> 01:04:18,091
You got two correct.

1755
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:19,192
(I'm coming to hit you.)

1756
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:21,527
Please, Kwang Soo.

1757
01:04:21,527 --> 01:04:23,162
- Why are you walking like a zombie? - It was "Train to Busan".

1758
01:04:23,162 --> 01:04:24,263
I guess so.

1759
01:04:24,263 --> 01:04:25,731
(It was "Train to Busan".)

1760
01:04:25,731 --> 01:04:27,266
He got infected!

1761
01:04:28,768 --> 01:04:30,636
This punk got infected.

1762
01:04:30,636 --> 01:04:33,039
He's going to turn into a monster too.

1763
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:34,607
Do you want to die?

1764
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:37,376
He threw the bait,

1765
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,314
and your daughter took it.

1766
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:43,749
Since the girls came to this house,

1767
01:04:44,117 --> 01:04:46,119
strange things keep on happening.

1768
01:04:46,552 --> 01:04:51,691
("Train to Busan", "The Wailing", and "A Tale of Two Sisters")

1769
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:54,827
It's not my fault I sat here. You know that, right?

1770
01:04:54,827 --> 01:04:56,896
- Your eyes. Focus. - I know.

1771
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:59,932
(Open your eyes properly.)

1772
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,969
Okay? Focus properly.

1773
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:05,104
(Focus properly.)

1774
01:05:05,104 --> 01:05:07,173
(Hitting)

1775
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:09,709
(So Min is wrong.)

1776
01:05:09,775 --> 01:05:11,511
Everybody, you just have to put it together.

1777
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:14,180
- Answer. - You just have to mix them.

1778
01:05:14,614 --> 01:05:16,382
Answer.

1779
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:17,783
Go.

1780
01:05:17,783 --> 01:05:18,918
Try it.

1781
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:20,586
- Do it. - I know now.

1782
01:05:20,586 --> 01:05:21,721
Answer.

1783
01:05:21,721 --> 01:05:23,723
(Hurry up.)

1784
01:05:23,723 --> 01:05:26,058
I'll get hit. It's not "The Priests".

1785
01:05:26,058 --> 01:05:28,461
(I'll get hit. It's not "The Priests".)

1786
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:29,629
"The Priests"...

1787
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:32,532
(He didn't get a heads-up.)

1788
01:05:32,532 --> 01:05:34,100
(It breaks.)

1789
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,268
Answer.

1790
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:36,469
Answer.

1791
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:39,672
(Jong Kook's squeaky hammer breaks apart after three uses.)

1792
01:05:39,672 --> 01:05:40,907
- Answer. - It broke.

1793
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,842
- Answer. - That hurt so much.

1794
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:44,310
"A Tale of Two Sisters",

1795
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,145
"Train to Busan",

1796
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,381
- and "The Wailing". - He's right.

1797
01:05:48,381 --> 01:05:50,683
(Jong Kook is right.)

1798
01:05:50,683 --> 01:05:51,951
I was going to say the same.

1799
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:54,620
That was "A Tale of Two Sisters"?

1800
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,789
- I didn't hear that one. - That was hard.

1801
01:05:56,789 --> 01:05:58,891
- That was hard. - That was.

1802
01:05:58,891 --> 01:06:00,026
Here's the next question.

1803
01:06:00,026 --> 01:06:02,228
Play, please.

1804
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:07,500
(What are the 3 films?)

1805
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:14,207
(I know this line.)

1806
01:06:14,207 --> 01:06:16,509
I think I know. I do.

1807
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:18,144
I know this music for sure.

1808
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:19,879
(I know as well.)

1809
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:24,050
This is driving me nuts. I can't remember the title of the film.

1810
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,218
I know two of them.

1811
01:06:25,218 --> 01:06:27,019
- I'm sure about two. - I know for sure.

1812
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:29,188
- I don't know the third one. - I can't hear it at all.

1813
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:31,023
- It's not good to speak first. - Right.

1814
01:06:31,023 --> 01:06:32,091
(In this situation, it's bad to speak first.)

1815
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:34,694
Try it then. Pick a third film.

1816
01:06:34,694 --> 01:06:40,533
(What? Why would we?)

1817
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:42,835
(He doesn't know any of them.)

1818
01:06:42,835 --> 01:06:44,136
Whom are you speaking to?

1819
01:06:44,136 --> 01:06:45,304
I guess you don't really know any films.

1820
01:06:45,304 --> 01:06:47,473
- Can you tell me? I only know one. - What is it?

1821
01:06:47,506 --> 01:06:49,075
Should we tell one each?

1822
01:06:49,275 --> 01:06:50,343
- Should we? - Okay.

1823
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:51,677
- What is it? - You tell me first.

1824
01:06:52,111 --> 01:06:53,813
You tell me first. I know two.

1825
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:56,182
(I'll tell you first.)

1826
01:06:56,182 --> 01:06:57,350
- Answer. - Why?

1827
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,785
(He's very sly.)

1828
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:03,189
"The Lawyers", "A Taxi Driver", and "1987: When the Day Comes".

1829
01:07:03,189 --> 01:07:04,390
- What did you say? - What?

1830
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,325
- No? - Answer.

1831
01:07:06,425 --> 01:07:07,827
"1987: When the Day Comes",

1832
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:10,062
"The Attorney",

1833
01:07:10,396 --> 01:07:14,634
- and "A Taxi Driver". - No, you're wrong.

1834
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:16,502
("1987: When the Day Comes", "The Attorney", and "A Taxi Driver")

1835
01:07:16,502 --> 01:07:18,738
(He's wrong.)

1836
01:07:18,738 --> 01:07:20,306
- You have to hit him. - Oh, right.

1837
01:07:20,306 --> 01:07:21,307
Why would you hit me?

1838
01:07:21,307 --> 01:07:22,842
(It's time for Seok Jin to be punished.)

1839
01:07:22,842 --> 01:07:24,377
(Wriggling)

1840
01:07:24,377 --> 01:07:27,346
(He looks intimidated.)

1841
01:07:27,513 --> 01:07:29,048
(Here I go.)

1842
01:07:29,048 --> 01:07:30,283
All right.

1843
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,985
- Please hurry. - I thought I was right.

1844
01:07:32,985 --> 01:07:34,387
- Hurry up. - Okay.

1845
01:07:34,487 --> 01:07:37,223
(Wriggling)

1846
01:07:37,223 --> 01:07:38,724
- But I... - Hey.

1847
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:39,892
(He tries to stall.)

1848
01:07:39,892 --> 01:07:41,494
- What? - Why?

1849
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:43,429
- Hurry up and hit me! - Fine.

1850
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:45,898
- Like this? - That's too much.

1851
01:07:45,898 --> 01:07:46,932
This much?

1852
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,434
(Should I hit him or not?)

1853
01:07:48,434 --> 01:07:50,136
(Hitting)

1854
01:07:50,136 --> 01:07:53,639
(He hits Jae Seok's private part.)

1855
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:54,874
(Seok Jin couldn't wait, so he attacked first.)

1856
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:55,941
I'm so mad.

1857
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,209
That was great.

1858
01:07:57,209 --> 01:07:58,511
That looked painful.

1859
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:00,346
His face is red.

1860
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:02,214
(He gets an emergency massage.)

1861
01:08:02,214 --> 01:08:03,282
- Think about something sad. - Goodness.

1862
01:08:03,282 --> 01:08:04,817
(He gets an emergency massage.)

1863
01:08:04,817 --> 01:08:06,852
You have two children, so you're fine.

1864
01:08:07,653 --> 01:08:08,888
- Hurry up. - Oh, gosh.

1865
01:08:08,888 --> 01:08:10,756
(They're both wrong.)

1866
01:08:10,756 --> 01:08:12,558
- Should we put our heads together? - What's the last one?

1867
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:14,894
I know. Answer.

1868
01:08:15,061 --> 01:08:16,262
"Anarchist from Colony".

1869
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:18,397
- Give me 200 dollars. - 100 dollars.

1870
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:21,467
(They start bidding to hit him.)

1871
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:22,702
I say 100 dollars.

1872
01:08:22,702 --> 01:08:26,005
(200 dollars? Let's do 100.)

1873
01:08:26,005 --> 01:08:27,406
- 100 dollars then. - Is that okay?

1874
01:08:27,406 --> 01:08:29,175
- 100 dollars. - And write my name once.

1875
01:08:29,408 --> 01:08:31,844
(As soon as Se Chan loses, they make a deal.)

1876
01:08:32,078 --> 01:08:36,682
(I thought Jong Kook wouldn't get to hit me,)

1877
01:08:36,682 --> 01:08:39,118
(so I hit him so hard.)

1878
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:41,454
- Take it off. - Hold on.

1879
01:08:41,454 --> 01:08:42,555
Wait.

1880
01:08:42,555 --> 01:08:44,857
- You said you won't hit the back. - I know.

1881
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:46,826
I won't hit the back of your head. I'll hit the crown.

1882
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:52,098
Hold on. Wait!

1883
01:08:52,131 --> 01:08:55,034
- It's like he hit me already. - Sit down.

1884
01:08:55,034 --> 01:08:56,802
- Hold on. Okay. - Sit down.

1885
01:08:56,936 --> 01:08:59,238
I thought I was getting hit.

1886
01:08:59,972 --> 01:09:03,109
You shouldn't have said it if you weren't certain.

1887
01:09:03,476 --> 01:09:06,645
(He takes a full swing.)

1888
01:09:08,214 --> 01:09:10,049
Isn't this from your head?

1889
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:12,051
Isn't this from your head?

1890
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:15,287
(Something came out.)

1891
01:09:15,287 --> 01:09:17,123
- This... - You lost a screw.

1892
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:19,525
- Isn't this from your head? - Can you put it back in?

1893
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:23,028
(Whatever it is, please put it back.)

1894
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,531
(Se Chan acted up and learned about life with 100 dollars.)

1895
01:09:25,531 --> 01:09:27,733
- Stop. This is over! - Can I have it back?

1896
01:09:27,767 --> 01:09:29,835
It's mine. Mine flew away.

1897
01:09:30,369 --> 01:09:32,037
What if you become stupid?

1898
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:33,839
Can we hear it again?

1899
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,674
Please play the films.

1900
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:36,976
I can't remember the title. It was that one.

1901
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:46,519
(What are the 3 films?)

1902
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:49,455
I know two for sure, but I can't remember the title of the last one.

1903
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:51,157
I know the film for sure.

1904
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:53,459
The examiner hit the table,

1905
01:09:54,093 --> 01:09:55,294
and he gasped...

1906
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:58,631
I'm sorry, Eun Jung. I have something to do.

1907
01:09:58,631 --> 01:09:59,632
(The background music sounds familiar. You knew this one, right?)

1908
01:09:59,632 --> 01:10:01,200
Let's go on a picnic another time.

1909
01:10:01,467 --> 01:10:04,804
(The music was from this scene.)

1910
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:07,206
I know all of them. What's the last one?

1911
01:10:07,339 --> 01:10:08,808
What's the last one?

1912
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:12,511
(Is it a film with Gong Yoo in it?)

1913
01:10:12,511 --> 01:10:14,346
(I think you're right.)

1914
01:10:14,346 --> 01:10:15,648
What's the title?

1915
01:10:15,648 --> 01:10:17,116
Let me give you a hint.

1916
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:18,717
- No. - Tell us.

1917
01:10:18,717 --> 01:10:20,386
- You can't. - I know for sure.

1918
01:10:20,386 --> 01:10:21,620
- Don't. - Give us a hint.

1919
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,856
- They might know. - I'm sure about this.

1920
01:10:23,856 --> 01:10:25,057
It's 50 dollars.

1921
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:27,960
(It's not free.)

1922
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,662
- Are you going to whisper? - Yes, I know for sure.

1923
01:10:29,662 --> 01:10:31,530
I'm sure about this.

1924
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:33,466
Okay, I'll do it. 50 dollars.

1925
01:10:33,866 --> 01:10:35,701
I have 50 dollars.

1926
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:37,036
(They trust Se Chan's words and buy the hint with 50 dollars.)

1927
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:38,370
- Line up. I'm sure about this. - 50 dollars.

1928
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,472
- I'll give it to you. - Write it down.

1929
01:10:39,472 --> 01:10:41,507
Will this be good enough?

1930
01:10:41,774 --> 01:10:43,542
As soon as you hear this, you'll get it right.

1931
01:10:44,243 --> 01:10:45,911
I'm certain. I'm certain about this.

1932
01:10:45,911 --> 01:10:47,379
- Hold on. - Aren't you going to do it?

1933
01:10:47,513 --> 01:10:48,914
- Here. - Okay, Jae Seok.

1934
01:10:49,081 --> 01:10:50,649
- What was it? - What is it?

1935
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,618
- I'll give you 50 dollars. - Jong Kook.

1936
01:10:52,618 --> 01:10:56,355
If you promise to write my name, I'll tell you.

1937
01:10:56,455 --> 01:10:59,325
You can get it right. Can you write my name in round two?

1938
01:10:59,325 --> 01:11:01,060
- I'll write your name. - My name. No.

1939
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,162
- Do you know the titles? - I'll tell you.

1940
01:11:03,162 --> 01:11:06,065
- Can you just write my name later? - Your name?

1941
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,733
- I will. - What is it?

1942
01:11:08,267 --> 01:11:09,969
It has Gong Yoo in it.

1943
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:13,772
You keep betraying. You even betray on the subway,

1944
01:11:13,772 --> 01:11:16,442
and then you betray some more.

1945
01:11:16,442 --> 01:11:17,843
What is that called?

1946
01:11:17,843 --> 01:11:19,912
I gave it to you. What is that called?

1947
01:11:19,912 --> 01:11:21,580
What is that called? What is it?

1948
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,615
So I...

1949
01:11:22,615 --> 01:11:24,149
There are two syllables.

1950
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:26,585
(This is it.)

1951
01:11:26,585 --> 01:11:28,921
- Answer! - What?

1952
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:30,389
- Answer. - Two names, okay?

1953
01:11:30,389 --> 01:11:32,458
- If I'm right. - Okay, two names.

1954
01:11:32,725 --> 01:11:34,093
(Something about betraying)

1955
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:35,461
- What is that? - You're right.

1956
01:11:35,828 --> 01:11:37,329
If he gets it right, Jae Seok did that for nothing.

1957
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:38,397
Two names.

1958
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:39,431
(So Min wanted 2 names for it. What was it?)

1959
01:11:39,431 --> 01:11:40,733
"1987: When the Day Comes",

1960
01:11:41,267 --> 01:11:43,936
"A Taxi Driver"...

1961
01:11:43,936 --> 01:11:45,938
("1987: When the Day Comes", "A Taxi Driver")

1962
01:11:45,938 --> 01:11:47,006
"The Age of Shadows".

1963
01:11:47,006 --> 01:11:48,974
(The last one is "The Age of Shadows".)

1964
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:53,412
(That was So Min's hint. Is it right?)

1965
01:11:54,013 --> 01:11:55,981
- It's "The Age of Shadows". - Two names.

1966
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:57,917
It's "The Age of Shadows".

1967
01:11:57,917 --> 01:11:59,652
It was "The Age of Shadows". I'm sorry.

1968
01:11:59,818 --> 01:12:01,186
Why didn't you get it right?

1969
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:03,789
Jae Seok, didn't it occur to you?

1970
01:12:03,822 --> 01:12:06,091
I told you it was betraying.

1971
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:07,660
I couldn't remember the title.

1972
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,061
- Hey. - It was "The Age of Shadows".

1973
01:12:10,162 --> 01:12:13,365
Get off the car and tell me, you arrogant punk.

1974
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:17,269
- Where did he go? - We don't know yet.

1975
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:18,637
Two names for me.

1976
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:20,506
(She gets 2 secured.)

1977
01:12:20,506 --> 01:12:22,775
Wasn't that "Assassination"?

1978
01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,910
We thought it was, but it was "The Age of Shadows".

1979
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,245
- That's right. - I got confused.

1980
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:27,846
- I thought it was "Assassination". - That was the betraying.

1981
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:28,981
So...

1982
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:31,383
Jong Kook gets two extra votes.

1983
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:32,585
- That's the result. - Well...

1984
01:12:32,585 --> 01:12:34,553
You all worked hard, but I get to have it.

1985
01:12:34,553 --> 01:12:37,189
He said he'll write my name down.

1986
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:39,325
- Thank you. - How much would you like?

1987
01:12:39,425 --> 01:12:42,161
Let's not do that. I'll sell...

1988
01:12:42,161 --> 01:12:43,996
- Sell it. - the ballot. What do you think?

1989
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:46,432
- What do you think? - Two ballots?

1990
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:49,668
I'll sell them if you write my name for all seven of them.

1991
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:53,806
(That's his condition for selling.)

1992
01:12:53,806 --> 01:12:54,907
- All seven of them. - Jong Kook.

1993
01:12:54,907 --> 01:12:56,108
We have to write your name for all seven?

1994
01:12:56,108 --> 01:12:57,676
- You have 2 left. - 7?

1995
01:12:57,676 --> 01:12:59,778
I'll give you a good amount of money.

1996
01:12:59,778 --> 01:13:01,146
- Me. I'll take it. - I'll do it.

1997
01:13:01,146 --> 01:13:02,381
- I'll write your name. - Jong Kook.

1998
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:03,549
- Really? - You trust me, right?

1999
01:13:03,549 --> 01:13:05,317
- Me. - Your name on all seven.

2000
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:06,518
- And? - Yes.

2001
01:13:06,518 --> 01:13:08,787
How much will you pay me?

2002
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:10,289
I have to pay you?

2003
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:12,057
Sorry, that was wrong.

2004
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:14,426
- You're taking the ballots. - This guy.

2005
01:13:14,526 --> 01:13:16,629
- Shouldn't I be paid? - Write my name.

2006
01:13:16,629 --> 01:13:18,230
And you have to pay me.

2007
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,898
I know. How much would you like?

2008
01:13:19,898 --> 01:13:21,266
That's what I meant. I have to pay you.

2009
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:23,068
I'm thinking 500 dollars.

2010
01:13:23,068 --> 01:13:24,803
- 500 dollars? - 300 dollars for me.

2011
01:13:24,803 --> 01:13:26,171
- 200 dollars. - 200.

2012
01:13:26,171 --> 01:13:28,040
(They can do it at 200 dollars.)

2013
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,508
- You're dropping the value. - Jong Kook.

2014
01:13:29,508 --> 01:13:31,310
(Jae Seok approaches him.)

2015
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:32,344
I'll do it at 10 dollars.

2016
01:13:32,344 --> 01:13:34,279
(I only want 10 dollars.)

2017
01:13:35,781 --> 01:13:37,249
Why did you call 10 dollars?

2018
01:13:37,249 --> 01:13:38,917
- For this? - Don't do that.

2019
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:41,186
Don't do that.

2020
01:13:41,186 --> 01:13:43,088
Big corporations shouldn't do this.

2021
01:13:43,088 --> 01:13:45,124
- Why can't I do it? - You're dropping the value.

2022
01:13:45,124 --> 01:13:46,959
- Don't do that. - You have to vote for me.

2023
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:48,594
- I'll make a deal. - You have to vote for me.

2024
01:13:48,594 --> 01:13:50,929
(The small business owners are gathered by him.)

2025
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:52,431
I'll vote for you.

2026
01:13:52,431 --> 01:13:55,067
Excuse me. I feel like I'm solving the quiz again.

2027
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:57,670
Their voices are getting mixed.

2028
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:59,104
Listen to me, Jong Kook.

2029
01:13:59,104 --> 01:14:00,506
I'll give you 10 dollars.

2030
01:14:00,506 --> 01:14:01,640
Jong Kook.

2031
01:14:02,408 --> 01:14:03,409
(He's very satisfied.)

2032
01:14:03,409 --> 01:14:05,310
- Okay. - Okay? Is that good?

2033
01:14:05,577 --> 01:14:07,279
- What was it? - You're going to pay him, right?

2034
01:14:07,913 --> 01:14:09,214
Why would you pay him?

2035
01:14:09,214 --> 01:14:11,216
- You're going to pay him? - You can't do that.

2036
01:14:11,216 --> 01:14:13,318
- Let's do it amongst ourselves. - Let's do that.

2037
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:15,487
- Who wants to join? - Come.

2038
01:14:15,487 --> 01:14:17,690
- Hold on. - They're not being fair.

2039
01:14:17,723 --> 01:14:20,726
- We're self-employed. - We'll do it amongst ourselves.

2040
01:14:20,726 --> 01:14:21,927
We're all self-employed.

2041
01:14:21,927 --> 01:14:23,095
We can't fight the big companies.

2042
01:14:23,095 --> 01:14:24,997
- 100 dollars. 2 votes for that. - 100 dollars?

2043
01:14:24,997 --> 01:14:26,498
- Okay, two votes. - Okay.

2044
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:29,568
You have to vote four times for me on the promissory note.

2045
01:14:29,568 --> 01:14:31,403
- This is for certain, right? - Two each, right?

2046
01:14:31,637 --> 01:14:34,540
Here are the results of the second vote.

2047
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,709
The person with the most votes...

2048
01:14:36,942 --> 01:14:38,844
is Ji Hyo with 15 votes.

2049
01:14:38,844 --> 01:14:39,978
(Ji Hyo is currently in 1st place.)

2050
01:14:39,978 --> 01:14:41,580
She has so many votes.

2051
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:42,681
How did she get so many?

2052
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:44,183
Next is tied in second place.

2053
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:46,852
- 3 people with 11 votes. - What?

2054
01:14:46,852 --> 01:14:48,921
Haha, Kwang Soo, and Jae Seok.

2055
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:49,955
(They're tied in 2nd place.)

2056
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:51,557
- How did that happen? - What happened?

2057
01:14:51,557 --> 01:14:53,692
- How did this happen suddenly? - How much did you spend?

2058
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:54,960
- I bought them. - I did too.

2059
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,128
I need to make money now.

2060
01:14:56,128 --> 01:14:57,563
- You're done. - In fifth place is...

2061
01:14:57,563 --> 01:14:59,231
Jong Kook with nine votes.

2062
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:01,233
- I'm in 5th place? - 9 votes?

2063
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,735
You got so many.

2064
01:15:02,735 --> 01:15:06,371
- 3 people are tied for last place. - 3 people?

2065
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:08,874
Seok Jin, So Min, and Se Chan with 8 votes.

2066
01:15:08,874 --> 01:15:10,242
That's close.

2067
01:15:10,242 --> 01:15:11,610
- I'm in a risky place. - I'll buy some too.

2068
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:13,011
Oh, gosh.

2069
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:15,614
- Let's go to the last location... - We're close.

2070
01:15:15,614 --> 01:15:17,416
- for round three. - I see.

2071
01:15:17,483 --> 01:15:20,252
(Current number of votes)

2072
01:15:21,186 --> 01:15:22,488
(This is the last round where results will be determined.)

2073
01:15:22,488 --> 01:15:23,856
Look at this.

2074
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:25,924
Is this where...

2075
01:15:25,924 --> 01:15:26,992
(This mission is a matter of life and death for the losers.)

2076
01:15:26,992 --> 01:15:28,327
The results will be decided here.

2077
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,396
They're giving us something. There's assorted beef.

2078
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:32,431
Really?

2079
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:35,167
(What is the last mission with assorted beef as the prize?)

2080
01:15:36,168 --> 01:15:39,338
(The curling board is back.)

2081
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:40,806
There's jjajangmyeon too.

2082
01:15:40,806 --> 01:15:42,307
What did you say? Jjajangmyeon?

2083
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:44,777
What's the chance card? It must be something.

2084
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:47,446
Everything will be decided here.

2085
01:15:47,446 --> 01:15:49,348
Before the final vote,

2086
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:51,717
this is your chance to win special ballots and snacks.

2087
01:15:51,717 --> 01:15:54,820
It's called Rice Bowl Lid Curling.

2088
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,256
(Rice Bowl Lid Curling)

2089
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:59,925
You need to slide your rice bowl lid, and depending on...

2090
01:15:59,925 --> 01:16:02,060
which zone it's the closest to, you get the designated snack.

2091
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,897
The person whose lid is the closest to the chance card...

2092
01:16:04,897 --> 01:16:07,666
gets to vote for themselves.

2093
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:09,568
- They get that in addition. - For all five?

2094
01:16:10,135 --> 01:16:12,905
(You can vote for yourself?)

2095
01:16:12,905 --> 01:16:14,439
You can use all five ballots.

2096
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,642
We have to get this.

2097
01:16:16,642 --> 01:16:18,677
- I have to hit gold. - For sure.

2098
01:16:18,677 --> 01:16:21,046
- I have to do this. - I have to try.

2099
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:22,648
If you hit the chance card, it's all over.

2100
01:16:22,648 --> 01:16:24,183
It's not a bad idea to defend in the beginning.

2101
01:16:24,183 --> 01:16:26,552
The person who wins this round...

2102
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:27,820
Quiet down.

2103
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,955
(Quiet down.)

2104
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:31,523
(You especially.)

2105
01:16:31,523 --> 01:16:32,991
(Goodness)

2106
01:16:33,525 --> 01:16:35,828
- Focus. - Excuse me.

2107
01:16:35,828 --> 01:16:37,162
This is a tense moment.

2108
01:16:37,162 --> 01:16:38,530
- This is so tense. - This is.

2109
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:39,698
I was saying the key point.

2110
01:16:39,698 --> 01:16:41,133
- Be quiet. - Quiet down.

2111
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:42,267
(Fine, okay.)

2112
01:16:42,267 --> 01:16:44,336
- Seok Jin. - Okay!

2113
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:47,573
I want the chance card, but I want jjajangmyeon too.

2114
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:49,474
Jjajangmyeon is worth it.

2115
01:16:49,474 --> 01:16:51,109
- You only have one chance. - I know.

2116
01:16:51,109 --> 01:16:52,444
(This is his last chance to climb up from last place.)

2117
01:16:52,444 --> 01:16:54,680
- Is this our last chance? - This much.

2118
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,181
- Yes, this is. - This much.

2119
01:16:56,181 --> 01:16:57,282
(He's currently in last place. Will he get the chance card?)

2120
01:16:57,282 --> 01:16:59,284
- You only have one chance. - I know.

2121
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,453
This much.

2122
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,188
This much.

2123
01:17:03,889 --> 01:17:06,291
(He got it.)

2124
01:17:07,392 --> 01:17:11,296
(Aim your rice bowl lid.)

2125
01:17:11,697 --> 01:17:12,831
Good one.

2126
01:17:13,065 --> 01:17:14,733
(It goes straight for the chance card...)

2127
01:17:14,733 --> 01:17:16,068
(but overshoots.)

2128
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:17,936
(Assorted beef)

2129
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:22,140
(He misses and lands on assorted beef.)

2130
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,275
Good.

2131
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,712
(Nice. It's assorted beef.)

2132
01:17:26,778 --> 01:17:28,080
(He's currently in assorted beef zone.)

2133
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:29,281
Assorted beef.

2134
01:17:29,281 --> 01:17:30,616
That's unbelievable.

2135
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,985
I was so close to the chance card.

2136
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:35,454
(Ji Hyo is next.)

2137
01:17:35,454 --> 01:17:37,389
Don't touch mine. Hey.

2138
01:17:37,389 --> 01:17:39,191
Pretend like you're going to hit his.

2139
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:41,126
- You can hit his. - If I hit Seok Jin's,

2140
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:43,729
- Right. You'll get the chance card. - I'll get the chance car.

2141
01:17:43,996 --> 01:17:45,364
Don't.

2142
01:17:45,364 --> 01:17:46,865
- Ji Hyo, that has to be your plan. - You can't.

2143
01:17:46,865 --> 01:17:48,166
Try hitting his.

2144
01:17:48,166 --> 01:17:49,501
(What do you mean I can't?)

2145
01:17:50,068 --> 01:17:51,770
Try hitting his.

2146
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,472
- Oh, dear. - Good. It's tofu.

2147
01:17:53,472 --> 01:17:56,375
(She misses and gets tofu.)

2148
01:17:56,441 --> 01:17:58,277
(She's currently in tofu zone.)

2149
01:17:58,277 --> 01:18:00,279
- It's tofu. - That's not bad.

2150
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:01,713
(Gosh, it's tofu.)

2151
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:03,649
Tofu is not bad.

2152
01:18:03,682 --> 01:18:06,051
She gets tofu even if she fails.

2153
01:18:06,718 --> 01:18:07,853
Assorted beef is amazing.

2154
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:09,421
(The lids can slide, so you can't be sure just yet.)

2155
01:18:09,421 --> 01:18:10,789
Why did it go that way?

2156
01:18:11,556 --> 01:18:13,358
This is interesting.

2157
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:17,062
Don't hit mine.

2158
01:18:17,162 --> 01:18:19,197
- He's weak at games like this. - No, no.

2159
01:18:19,197 --> 01:18:20,465
Okay!

2160
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:22,367
- Let's see. - No, no.

2161
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:23,735
(What?)

2162
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:24,970
Out.

2163
01:18:25,337 --> 01:18:26,538
- Look. - Okay!

2164
01:18:26,538 --> 01:18:28,206
- He's out. - It's out.

2165
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:29,741
- Out. - Is it out?

2166
01:18:29,741 --> 01:18:31,276
- He gets nothing. - Out. Okay.

2167
01:18:31,677 --> 01:18:33,612
- That's better. - What do you mean?

2168
01:18:33,612 --> 01:18:35,580
- He says it's okay. - It's better than a lemon.

2169
01:18:35,647 --> 01:18:39,051
(So Min, who's also in last place, goes next.)

2170
01:18:39,117 --> 01:18:40,786
(To throw the lid...)

2171
01:18:40,786 --> 01:18:42,154
It doesn't slide that well.

2172
01:18:42,154 --> 01:18:43,188
(To throw the lid, she waited for this moment.)

2173
01:18:43,188 --> 01:18:44,289
Soup.

2174
01:18:44,289 --> 01:18:45,691
- Jjajangmyeon. - Okay.

2175
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:47,259
- Really? - Why?

2176
01:18:47,259 --> 01:18:48,827
(She got assorted beef in the 2nd practice run.)

2177
01:18:48,827 --> 01:18:50,462
Assorted beef.

2178
01:18:51,363 --> 01:18:55,467
(If she does as she did during practice, she can win.)

2179
01:18:55,467 --> 01:18:59,404
(Where will her lid land?)

2180
01:19:06,278 --> 01:19:07,646
What?

2181
01:19:08,246 --> 01:19:09,614
Out.

2182
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:11,316
That was unexpected.

2183
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,051
- What was that? That's not fair. - Hey.

2184
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:14,753
- Okay. - Hey.

2185
01:19:14,853 --> 01:19:16,188
It's fine.

2186
01:19:16,188 --> 01:19:18,490
Haha, you have to get Seok Jin out of there.

2187
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:21,994
(Seok Jin's lid is closest to the chance card.)

2188
01:19:21,994 --> 01:19:23,762
Seok Jin's lid is closest to the chance card.

2189
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:25,197
You have to hit Seok Jin's.

2190
01:19:25,664 --> 01:19:27,499
I'm going to sell assorted beef.

2191
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:29,234
You have to pretend like you're hitting his lid.

2192
01:19:29,234 --> 01:19:30,736
He's closest to the chance card.

2193
01:19:30,736 --> 01:19:33,105
- Don't. - Hit his.

2194
01:19:33,138 --> 01:19:34,206
What?

2195
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:35,841
(Let's bring it close to the chance card.)

2196
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:41,613
(It goes straight for the chance card.)

2197
01:19:43,648 --> 01:19:47,652
(It slides in a straight line.)

2198
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:49,154
- Gum. - No.

2199
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:50,222
It's gum.

2200
01:19:50,222 --> 01:19:54,059
(It lands in gum zone.)

2201
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:55,660
- It's gum. - It's gum.

2202
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,162
- No, it's not. - It is.

2203
01:19:57,162 --> 01:19:58,997
- It's gum. - It is.

2204
01:19:58,997 --> 01:20:00,766
It's still closest to the chance card.

2205
01:20:00,766 --> 01:20:02,901
(It's still closest to the chance card.)

2206
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:05,837
- Haha is closest to chance card. - I needed gum.

2207
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:07,305
(He's close to the center, so it might move.)

2208
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:08,573
- Se Chan. - Don't hit mine.

2209
01:20:08,573 --> 01:20:10,108
- You have to hit his. - You can't.

2210
01:20:10,108 --> 01:20:13,979
(Se Chan, who's also in last place, goes next.)

2211
01:20:14,212 --> 01:20:18,150
(If he doesn't get the chance card, it'll be hard not to lose.)

2212
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:23,221
(He's desperate. Where will the lid go?)

2213
01:20:25,323 --> 01:20:26,825
(Sliding)

2214
01:20:27,926 --> 01:20:29,861
- Lemon. - Lemon.

2215
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:32,531
(He's currently in lemon zone.)

2216
01:20:32,531 --> 01:20:34,066
Why did I follow Jong Kook?

2217
01:20:34,232 --> 01:20:35,734
Yes, beef!

2218
01:20:36,968 --> 01:20:39,171
(At this rate, beef will be mine.)

2219
01:20:39,171 --> 01:20:41,273
- Beef! - I'm in trouble.

2220
01:20:41,273 --> 01:20:44,242
(The other two in last place didn't get anything.)

2221
01:20:45,143 --> 01:20:46,578
Should I go for the center?

2222
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:48,980
Excuse me. It's not like you can get it...

2223
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,116
- if you aim for it. - Come on.

2224
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,518
I was telling myself that.

2225
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:55,720
You sat down and said, "Should I go for the center?"

2226
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:57,155
What was that?

2227
01:20:57,155 --> 01:20:58,890
Just get the flogging later.

2228
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,660
(You have no chance.)

2229
01:21:02,594 --> 01:21:04,396
- Oh, dear. - I'm just saying.

2230
01:21:04,429 --> 01:21:07,299
- You're trying too hard. - What are you doing?

2231
01:21:07,499 --> 01:21:09,568
(As the round comes to an end, it gets more tense.)

2232
01:21:09,568 --> 01:21:12,704
- Try to hit Seok Jin's. - Okay.

2233
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,839
(Jae Seok is up next.)

2234
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,041
What?

2235
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,043
(He slides his lid with his eyes wide open.)

2236
01:21:18,043 --> 01:21:19,377
Okay!

2237
01:21:20,846 --> 01:21:22,047
Okay!

2238
01:21:22,047 --> 01:21:23,782
(Out)

2239
01:21:23,782 --> 01:21:25,150
- It's out. - It's out.

2240
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:26,885
(Jae Seok's lid is out.)

2241
01:21:26,885 --> 01:21:28,787
- It's out. - Why did you slide it so hard?

2242
01:21:28,854 --> 01:21:31,523
Why am I so unlucky?

2243
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:33,592
2, 4, 6. This is the last one.

2244
01:21:33,758 --> 01:21:35,961
I can't make it land on the target. There is no way.

2245
01:21:35,961 --> 01:21:38,363
I have no choice but to make it hit the wall first.

2246
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:41,032
- Do it. Make a cushion shot. - Make a cushion shot.

2247
01:21:41,233 --> 01:21:43,301
- Make it bounce off. - One-cushion shot.

2248
01:21:43,301 --> 01:21:44,736
It needs to hit the wall first.

2249
01:21:44,736 --> 01:21:45,971
(He plans to bounce it off.)

2250
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:50,041
Hold on. This is too much.

2251
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:52,711
(This is too much.)

2252
01:21:52,711 --> 01:21:55,547
- This is important. - I know that.

2253
01:21:56,615 --> 01:21:58,083
(Touching)

2254
01:21:59,351 --> 01:22:00,986
(Tickling)

2255
01:22:02,721 --> 01:22:05,624
Hold on. Do you want me to ignore you?

2256
01:22:06,057 --> 01:22:07,792
- How am I supposed to react? - What?

2257
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,328
Don't ask me. Go ahead and make your shot.

2258
01:22:10,328 --> 01:22:11,730
- Okay. - Do it comfortably.

2259
01:22:12,397 --> 01:22:15,433
This is the last one.

2260
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:20,372
(Can Kwang Soo make his lid land on a nice zone?)

2261
01:22:22,207 --> 01:22:23,241
Go for the middle.

2262
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:24,376
(He slides the lid.)

2263
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:29,314
Go for the middle.

2264
01:22:29,714 --> 01:22:31,550
- Sophora root tea. - Seok Jin got sophora root tea.

2265
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,585
(Hitting)

2266
01:22:34,386 --> 01:22:37,255
(Seok Jin gets sophora root tea.)

2267
01:22:37,255 --> 01:22:41,059
(Kwang Soo gives sophora root tea to Seok Jin and gets lemon.)

2268
01:22:41,059 --> 01:22:42,694
(Sophora root tea?)

2269
01:22:42,694 --> 01:22:43,962
Sophora root tea.

2270
01:22:44,229 --> 01:22:46,364
(Staggering)

2271
01:22:46,965 --> 01:22:48,099
Sophora root tea.

2272
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,035
- Sophora root tea. - You...

2273
01:22:50,035 --> 01:22:52,170
(Rice Bowl Lid Curling ends without anyone winning the chance card.)

2274
01:22:53,438 --> 01:22:58,677
(Jong Kook wins assorted beef with the additional mission.)

2275
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:01,079
What is that? Is that Korean beef?

2276
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:02,847
- It's Korean beef. - There is a lot.

2277
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:03,848
(The thick cuts of Korean beef sizzle beautifully.)

2278
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:05,684
It has been grilled to perfection.

2279
01:23:05,684 --> 01:23:07,719
It should be made into a wrap.

2280
01:23:08,053 --> 01:23:09,354
Let me try it.

2281
01:23:09,354 --> 01:23:12,424
Who has 370 dollars?

2282
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:13,425
So Min.

2283
01:23:13,425 --> 01:23:15,360
(I am jealous.)

2284
01:23:16,995 --> 01:23:18,430
Ji Hyo has 400 dollars.

2285
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:22,467
(Is this a snack time or a penalty time?)

2286
01:23:25,036 --> 01:23:27,572
I will go to the snack bar and buy food.

2287
01:23:27,572 --> 01:23:30,508
- I will eat ramyeon. - Unless you really want to win...

2288
01:23:30,942 --> 01:23:32,844
Ji Hyo might feel that way, but you have no chance.

2289
01:23:33,345 --> 01:23:34,946
You can write my name on one of them.

2290
01:23:34,946 --> 01:23:38,316
How many spaces do you have left for the names?

2291
01:23:38,316 --> 01:23:39,951
I haven't written any names yet.

2292
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:41,353
Jae Seok, why don't we write each other's names twice?

2293
01:23:41,353 --> 01:23:42,621
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

2294
01:23:42,621 --> 01:23:44,956
You will write my name twice, right? Okay. That's good.

2295
01:23:44,956 --> 01:23:46,458
- It will be cooked, right? - Yes.

2296
01:23:46,458 --> 01:23:48,159
(Peeking)

2297
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:50,762
What are the three of you doing?

2298
01:23:50,762 --> 01:23:51,796
What?

2299
01:23:51,796 --> 01:23:53,398
Let me join in.

2300
01:23:53,398 --> 01:23:55,634
I will write your name if you are close to the bottom.

2301
01:23:55,634 --> 01:23:57,736
(Let's make a deal.)

2302
01:23:57,836 --> 01:23:59,804
Please write my name, Seok Jin.

2303
01:23:59,804 --> 01:24:00,805
Okay.

2304
01:24:00,805 --> 01:24:01,840
(What does he mean?)

2305
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:02,941
(It's only a scheme.)

2306
01:24:02,941 --> 01:24:04,075
Okay.

2307
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:07,879
- So Min. - Yes?

2308
01:24:07,879 --> 01:24:09,247
Do you want to write each other's names five times?

2309
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:11,616
Let's do that. Let's turn the tables.

2310
01:24:11,616 --> 01:24:14,085
- Let's use our promissory notes. - We must fulfill this promise.

2311
01:24:14,085 --> 01:24:15,220
That's right.

2312
01:24:15,453 --> 01:24:16,821
We will write each other's names five times.

2313
01:24:16,821 --> 01:24:18,056
(That's a lot.)

2314
01:24:18,056 --> 01:24:19,324
We will write each other's names five times.

2315
01:24:19,991 --> 01:24:23,995
(So Min and Seok Jin teamed up for their secret deal...)

2316
01:24:23,995 --> 01:24:26,064
(of writing each other's names 5 times.)

2317
01:24:27,132 --> 01:24:29,067
(I believe in Seok Jin.)

2318
01:24:29,067 --> 01:24:31,636
- Do you have cup ramyeon? - No.

2319
01:24:31,636 --> 01:24:33,938
- Ramyeon comes out cooked, right? - Yes.

2320
01:24:33,938 --> 01:24:36,341
Okay. Okay, okay.

2321
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:38,209
- Here are 700 dollars for ramyeon. - Give me a discount.

2322
01:24:38,209 --> 01:24:39,344
Cook me ramyeon.

2323
01:24:39,344 --> 01:24:40,745
(With her faith in Seok Jin, So Min shops like a rich woman.)

2324
01:24:40,745 --> 01:24:42,947
I will buy chopsticks for 100 dollars.

2325
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:44,716
- What? - Chopsticks for 100 dollars.

2326
01:24:44,716 --> 01:24:46,885
- I will sell them. - I will buy them for 100 dollars.

2327
01:24:46,885 --> 01:24:48,353
(She squanders her money.)

2328
01:24:48,353 --> 01:24:50,755
I don't have chopsticks.

2329
01:24:50,755 --> 01:24:51,756
(I know that Se Chan will lose.)

2330
01:24:51,756 --> 01:24:52,991
Okay.

2331
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:54,192
(Meanwhile, Se Chan...)

2332
01:24:54,793 --> 01:24:58,430
If I write Seok Jin's name here,

2333
01:24:58,763 --> 01:25:00,231
Seok Jin will have more votes than you.

2334
01:25:01,032 --> 01:25:02,267
- Really? - Yes.

2335
01:25:03,034 --> 01:25:05,437
I will buy that vote. I will give you 100 dollars.

2336
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:06,938
Just know that I still won't write your name.

2337
01:25:06,938 --> 01:25:09,541
(Just know that I still won't write your name.)

2338
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:11,409
I won't write Seok Jin's name.

2339
01:25:11,409 --> 01:25:13,578
(He says he won't write Seok Jin's name or his name.)

2340
01:25:13,578 --> 01:25:15,347
What are you talking about?

2341
01:25:15,347 --> 01:25:17,982
So you will take my money without writing my name.

2342
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:20,852
Yes. Does money mean anything to you at this point?

2343
01:25:20,852 --> 01:25:22,220
- No, it doesn't. - Do you want a beating?

2344
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:23,355
(The penalty is flogging.)

2345
01:25:23,355 --> 01:25:24,856
- No. - Do you want a beating right now?

2346
01:25:24,856 --> 01:25:26,224
(Threatening)

2347
01:25:26,224 --> 01:25:27,726
- Why would you ask that? - Excuse me?

2348
01:25:27,726 --> 01:25:29,661
- I mean... - Are you talking back to me?

2349
01:25:29,661 --> 01:25:32,263
- I will write Seok Jin's name. - I understood your point.

2350
01:25:32,364 --> 01:25:33,898
How much do you need?

2351
01:25:34,265 --> 01:25:36,568
Not writing Seok Jin's name costs 400 dollars.

2352
01:25:36,735 --> 01:25:37,969
Not writing So Min's name costs 300 dollars.

2353
01:25:38,336 --> 01:25:40,038
I will pay for the latter.

2354
01:25:40,038 --> 01:25:42,941
I just need to get more votes than her.

2355
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:45,477
(I want someone else to have the lowest number of votes.)

2356
01:25:46,978 --> 01:25:50,081
It will be either me, So Min, or Se Chan.

2357
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:52,150
- Seok Jin. - I don't know.

2358
01:25:52,150 --> 01:25:53,718
So Min, did you sell a lot of votes?

2359
01:25:54,452 --> 01:25:55,687
- What do you mean? - The votes for the names.

2360
01:25:55,687 --> 01:25:56,988
- The names? - Yes.

2361
01:25:57,689 --> 01:26:00,125
Did you buy ramyeon instead of other members' votes?

2362
01:26:00,525 --> 01:26:02,894
- I was too hungry. - What are you going to do?

2363
01:26:02,894 --> 01:26:05,029
(She has her faith in Seok Jin.)

2364
01:26:05,563 --> 01:26:06,765
It's really tasty.

2365
01:26:07,031 --> 01:26:09,234
- Se Chan bought it. - How about me?

2366
01:26:09,234 --> 01:26:10,402
Tell me...

2367
01:26:11,603 --> 01:26:13,772
- how much money you have. - Chopsticks.

2368
01:26:13,772 --> 01:26:16,441
Let me see if I can flog you or not. It's meaningless otherwise.

2369
01:26:17,142 --> 01:26:18,143
Here.

2370
01:26:18,143 --> 01:26:19,978
I can use these, right?

2371
01:26:19,978 --> 01:26:23,081
(They are toys he received from Jae Seok.)

2372
01:26:23,081 --> 01:26:24,482
- Yes. - I will use them as chopsticks.

2373
01:26:24,916 --> 01:26:26,451
My goodness.

2374
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:27,452
(Jae Seok didn't expect this.)

2375
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:29,387
(I need chopsticks.)

2376
01:26:31,389 --> 01:26:33,224
I will sell these chopsticks for 100 dollars.

2377
01:26:33,224 --> 01:26:35,860
Forget it. I might win.

2378
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:37,328
100 dollars.

2379
01:26:37,829 --> 01:26:39,030
(Let's see.)

2380
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:40,865
- 100 dollars. - I couldn't help but eat.

2381
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:43,535
- Me neither. - Those are mine.

2382
01:26:43,535 --> 01:26:46,271
(He is the owner of sophora root tea.)

2383
01:26:47,338 --> 01:26:49,441
If you write my name, I will give them to you.

2384
01:26:49,441 --> 01:26:52,243
Let's clear the snacks now. You will now spend...

2385
01:26:52,243 --> 01:26:54,345
about 10 minutes to vote.

2386
01:26:54,345 --> 01:26:56,214
- Are we clearing the snacks? - We will do that now.

2387
01:26:56,214 --> 01:26:58,249
I didn't even get to eat it because I didn't have chopsticks.

2388
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:01,352
- Give me chopsticks. - I will give these to you...

2389
01:27:01,352 --> 01:27:02,353
if you write my name.

2390
01:27:02,353 --> 01:27:04,456
I will give these to you if you write my name.

2391
01:27:04,456 --> 01:27:06,858
- I can't do that because... - Then don't write Se Chan's name.

2392
01:27:06,958 --> 01:27:08,259
- Then you can have these. - Kwang Soo.

2393
01:27:08,259 --> 01:27:09,994
- Don't write Se Chan's name? - That's right.

2394
01:27:09,994 --> 01:27:11,629
- Okay. - Okay.

2395
01:27:11,663 --> 01:27:13,798
- I will give you 400 dollars. - Take his offer.

2396
01:27:13,798 --> 01:27:15,934
Take his offer and write his name.

2397
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:18,336
It's everything I have.

2398
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:20,405
I will give you 400 dollars.

2399
01:27:20,605 --> 01:27:22,407
- I will give you 400 dollars. - Okay.

2400
01:27:22,407 --> 01:27:25,043
It's a competition between the ones at the bottom.

2401
01:27:25,043 --> 01:27:29,080
I will reveal the result where the penalty will take place.

2402
01:27:31,049 --> 01:27:33,251
(It's the final moment.)

2403
01:27:33,251 --> 01:27:35,620
What is that? My goodness.

2404
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:36,955
(The equipment for flogging is on standby.)

2405
01:27:36,955 --> 01:27:38,256
I will reveal the result.

2406
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:40,391
With the promissory notes,

2407
01:27:40,658 --> 01:27:43,228
the person who has the most amount of money is...

2408
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:44,829
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

2409
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:46,931
Kim Jong Kook with 2,400 dollars.

2410
01:27:46,931 --> 01:27:49,501
(Kim Jong Kook with 2,400 dollars)

2411
01:27:49,501 --> 01:27:51,836
- Me? - My goodness.

2412
01:27:51,836 --> 01:27:54,639
- He can buy that. - I received so much at the end...

2413
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:55,807
that I didn't know how much I had.

2414
01:27:55,807 --> 01:27:59,544
- Please pick a present. - That's incredible.

2415
01:27:59,544 --> 01:28:01,045
I will take the humidifier.

2416
01:28:01,045 --> 01:28:04,249
- I don't have a humidifier at home. - Jong Kook chose the humidifier.

2417
01:28:04,249 --> 01:28:07,452
Also, Jong Kook has the right to flog the member...

2418
01:28:07,452 --> 01:28:09,220
with the lowest number of votes.

2419
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:11,089
Jong Kook will do the flogging.

2420
01:28:11,723 --> 01:28:12,924
It's going to hurt.

2421
01:28:13,291 --> 01:28:15,793
When will I ever win in a race like this one?

2422
01:28:15,793 --> 01:28:18,897
In terms of votes, the 1st place is Song Ji Hyo with 18 votes.

2423
01:28:18,897 --> 01:28:20,431
(Song Ji Hyo with 18 votes)

2424
01:28:20,431 --> 01:28:21,799
She looks after people.

2425
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:25,436
The 2nd place has 16 votes. It's Lee Kwang Soo.

2426
01:28:25,436 --> 01:28:28,039
(Lee Kwang Soo with 16 votes)

2427
01:28:28,039 --> 01:28:30,542
(It's an unexpected result.)

2428
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:32,076
Does he have 16 votes?

2429
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:33,511
(Everyone is incredulous.)

2430
01:28:33,511 --> 01:28:35,880
- 16 votes. - No way.

2431
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,450
Thank you. It's heartwarming.

2432
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:42,954
Now, I will announce the last place.

2433
01:28:42,954 --> 01:28:45,056
(Now comes the last place.)

2434
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,891
- Now? - Is there a small difference?

2435
01:28:46,891 --> 01:28:49,260
- Yes. 1 vote divided the result. - 1 vote?

2436
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:50,695
- 1 vote divided the result. - Yes.

2437
01:28:50,695 --> 01:28:52,330
- 1 vote. - 1 vote.

2438
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,466
(Among them, who is fated to place last?)

2439
01:28:56,901 --> 01:29:01,239
(So Min teamed up with Seok Jin and exchanged 5 votes.)

2440
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:03,741
(She even ate ramyeon because she believed in Seok Jin.)

2441
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:08,947
(Se Chan stopped Seok Jin and So Min from getting votes.)

2442
01:29:08,947 --> 01:29:10,815
- You don't have to write my name. - Really?

2443
01:29:10,815 --> 01:29:11,849
I will give you 400 dollars.

2444
01:29:11,849 --> 01:29:18,756
(Seok Jin spent his entire fortune to buy votes.)

2445
01:29:20,024 --> 01:29:22,360
The last place has 13 votes.

2446
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:26,397
(Who is fated to place last?)

2447
01:29:26,397 --> 01:29:30,034
(This person must be flogged by Jong Kook.)

2448
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:31,135
Jeon So Min.

2449
01:29:31,135 --> 01:29:33,438
(It's Jeon So Min.)

2450
01:29:34,172 --> 01:29:35,540
How many votes did Seok Jin and I get?

2451
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,709
- 15 votes. - We promised to write...

2452
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:39,677
each other's names five times.

2453
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:42,847
I spent the rest of my money to buy votes,

2454
01:29:42,847 --> 01:29:45,583
but she ate ramyeon. That made the difference.

2455
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:48,086
I ate a 800-dollar ramyeon.

2456
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:51,322
- You truly are the tiger moth. - Why did you eat ramyeon?

2457
01:29:51,322 --> 01:29:53,691
Kwang Soo, if I gave you...

2458
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:55,627
100 dollars in real life, would you get flogged instead?

2459
01:29:55,994 --> 01:29:58,463
- In real life. - I am not a beggar.

2460
01:29:58,463 --> 01:30:00,732
You look interested.

2461
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:03,034
I think you will be swayed if the amount is 150 dollars.

2462
01:30:03,034 --> 01:30:04,302
In that case, maybe.

2463
01:30:04,302 --> 01:30:05,336
(50 dollars make a difference.)

2464
01:30:05,336 --> 01:30:07,472
So Min, get your wallet out.

2465
01:30:08,406 --> 01:30:09,807
- It should start at this height. - Really?

2466
01:30:09,807 --> 01:30:11,409
It should start at this height.

2467
01:30:11,409 --> 01:30:14,045
Jae Seok, do you want to give us a simulation?

2468
01:30:14,045 --> 01:30:16,681
This is how you get flogged.

2469
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:17,682
(It doesn't need a simulation.)

2470
01:30:17,682 --> 01:30:19,550
- Give it a try. - Kwang Soo, come here.

2471
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:21,052
(Kwang Soo, come here.)

2472
01:30:21,052 --> 01:30:22,320
- This is how you get flogged. - I am up for it.

2473
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:24,789
- This is how you get flogged. - Watch.

2474
01:30:24,789 --> 01:30:26,324
Kwang Soo will give us a simulation.

2475
01:30:27,258 --> 01:30:29,861
- Go ahead. - I don't want to surprise So Min.

2476
01:30:29,861 --> 01:30:31,262
- It doesn't hurt that badly. - I know that.

2477
01:30:31,262 --> 01:30:32,563
- It's not that bad. - Okay.

2478
01:30:32,563 --> 01:30:34,399
- You don't need to be scared. - You don't need to be scared.

2479
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:36,801
If you hold the oar about this high and hit here, it doesn't hurt.

2480
01:30:36,801 --> 01:30:38,169
(Watch carefully.)

2481
01:30:39,404 --> 01:30:41,305
(I don't think you hit the right place.)

2482
01:30:41,305 --> 01:30:44,509
- It doesn't hurt, right? - It doesn't hurt at all.

2483
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:45,977
- It doesn't hurt, right? - It doesn't hurt at all.

2484
01:30:45,977 --> 01:30:47,445
That's the blow.

2485
01:30:47,445 --> 01:30:48,646
- That's the blow. - It only sounds bad.

2486
01:30:48,646 --> 01:30:50,248
- Here I go. - The height is just right.

2487
01:30:50,248 --> 01:30:51,449
- Here? - Yes.

2488
01:30:51,449 --> 01:30:53,618
- Do I swing like this? - That's right.

2489
01:30:53,618 --> 01:30:55,153
- Shall I begin? - Go ahead.

2490
01:30:55,153 --> 01:30:57,989
1, 2, 3.

2491
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:02,460
Three.

2492
01:31:06,364 --> 01:31:09,233
(This is not an act, is it?)

2493
01:31:09,233 --> 01:31:10,802
That must have hurt.

2494
01:31:11,035 --> 01:31:12,804
(Viewers, this is the danger of ramyeon.)

2495
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:14,505
- Hey, this is... - What is it?

2496
01:31:14,505 --> 01:31:16,841
- That must've hurt a little. - You told me to do it.

2497
01:31:16,841 --> 01:31:18,176
- Are you okay? - Listen.

2498
01:31:18,176 --> 01:31:20,244
Hey, everyone should get it.

2499
01:31:20,678 --> 01:31:22,980
To invigorate your energy,

2500
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:25,483
we prepared a race to build up your health.

2501
01:31:25,483 --> 01:31:27,385
(These delicacies will arouse your disappearing appetites.)

2502
01:31:27,585 --> 01:31:30,054
(That's amazing. We have to eat that!)

2503
01:31:30,154 --> 01:31:32,023
(However,)

2504
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:35,760
(these aren't your regular, invigorating dishes.)

2505
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,329
(Their pupils are dilated.)

2506
01:31:38,329 --> 01:31:41,799
(This race for invigorating dishes will make their jaws drop.)

2507
01:31:42,433 --> 01:31:44,869
(A mysterious mission awaits the members too.)

2508
01:31:44,869 --> 01:31:47,305
(No one can taste these delicacies.)

2509
01:31:47,305 --> 01:31:49,474
(They end up hurting themselves while trying to eat these dishes.)

2510
01:31:49,474 --> 01:31:50,708
My body aches every week.

2511
01:31:51,309 --> 01:31:53,377
