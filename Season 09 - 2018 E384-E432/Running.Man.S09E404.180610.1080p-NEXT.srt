1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,910
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:10,914 --> 00:00:13,450
- Hello. - Move out of my way.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,880
- I'm sitting at the end. - Welcome.

4
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:17,950
(Kwang Soo refuses Se Chan's push.)

5
00:00:17,954 --> 00:00:20,120
You sit next to Jong Kook.

6
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:22,790
- Sit next to Jong Kook. - No.

7
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,075
- Go next to Jong Kook. - Sit here.

8
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:29,660
Okay, that's done. I feel so relieved.

9
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,015
(Why is Kwang Soo refusing?)

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,915
(Punching)

11
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,230
(He felt the power of Jong Kook's squeaky hammer.)

12
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,155
(He's determined not to sit next to Jong Kook during games.)

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,955
(Is my hearing okay?)

14
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:47,865
- I feel so relieved. - You two became close friends.

15
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,920
- I was startled during my shower. - Why?

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,235
I was washing my hair.

17
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:55,020
(He screamed while washing his hair.)

18
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:58,320
Some of my hair was missing. My head hurt so much.

19
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:01,560
- Are you bruised from last week? - Yes.

20
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:03,930
- That's being coldhearted. - Right.

21
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,200
- Hello, everyone. - Hello.

22
00:01:06,202 --> 00:01:08,330
Why are you so late?

23
00:01:08,338 --> 00:01:10,940
- I arrived first and waited. - Why did you come so late?

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,970
I had to spit my gum out.

25
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:15,825
- Come and have a seat. - Hello, everyone.

26
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,110
- Hello. - Why are you so late?

27
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,210
- Pardon? - We're wearing the same cap.

28
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,380
(We're wearing the same cap.)

29
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:23,450
Goodness.

30
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:26,050
- Stop it. - My goodness.

31
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:27,450
(The brothers have reunited.)

32
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:29,565
We're wearing the same cap.

33
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:33,190
You're copying me these days. You're also wearing layers like me.

34
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:35,830
Jae Seok wasn't wearing this cap when I saw him a moment ago.

35
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:39,800
(Let me put on the same one.)

36
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,230
(Is he copying Haha's style?)

37
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:42,930
This is frustrating.

38
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:45,140
Will you be on "High School Rapper" as well?

39
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:46,670
This is frustrating.

40
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,770
What does "High School Rapper" have to do with wearing this cap?

41
00:01:48,778 --> 00:01:53,055
I'm your role model from now on.

42
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,565
(Stop messing around.)

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,820
Is Ji Hyo working on a movie?

44
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,120
- Ji Hyo? - Are you working on a drama too?

45
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:01,420
Is she working on a movie and a drama?

46
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:02,820
Both at the same time?

47
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:06,075
- I got many offers all at once. - That's impressive.

48
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:08,660
- Worst times will start now. - That's amazing.

49
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,030
(Worst times will start now.)

50
00:02:11,034 --> 00:02:13,670
What will happen to us if she starts working on both of them?

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,730
It's her first time working on both. What shall we do?

52
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,200
When Ji Hyo works on a movie or a drama, she becomes sensitive.

53
00:02:18,208 --> 00:02:21,455
- She does. - It'll be like a gift set.

54
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:23,940
- In that case... - Which role are you playing?

55
00:02:23,947 --> 00:02:25,880
- It depends on your role. - I know.

56
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:27,895
She plays the wife of Ma Dong Seok.

57
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,095
- Ma Dong Seok's wife. - We're dead meat.

58
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
- Be careful. I'll tell on you. - Don't tell on us.

59
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:36,420
Ma Dong Seok's arm is bigger than your thigh.

60
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:38,620
- Be quiet. What about yours? - I think so.

61
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:41,730
- Your thighs are small too. - They're bigger than yours.

62
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:44,730
Stop it. It's because my legs are American-style.

63
00:02:44,734 --> 00:02:48,870
- "American-style"? - My legs are American-style.

64
00:02:48,872 --> 00:02:51,140
What do you mean? How are they American-style?

65
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:53,440
Then why are they so thin?

66
00:02:53,443 --> 00:02:56,340
- No Americans have legs like those. - Listen.

67
00:02:56,346 --> 00:02:59,340
- In retirement homes? - No.

68
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:02,550
They're like thighs of American basketball players.

69
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:04,750
All you need are wheels on your chair.

70
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:07,035
(Instead of being western, he's old.)

71
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:08,390
(That's so harsh.)

72
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:09,420
How dare you?

73
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,520
(He's subdued easily.)

74
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:13,320
- You punk. - How can you say that?

75
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,760
- You'd better be careful. - You're being too harsh on him.

76
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:18,660
- You're worse than him. - I saw a photo.

77
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:20,570
- It looked exactly like you. - Be quiet.

78
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,770
It was a sandpiper. Sandpipers have legs like yours.

79
00:03:23,773 --> 00:03:26,100
(Sandpipers have a wide torso with thin, long legs.)

80
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:30,040
My legs are long. I have long legs.

81
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:32,880
Kwang Soo appeared in "The Accidental Detective".

82
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:35,050
- That's right. - He wore a wig.

83
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,950
- Pardon? - Didn't he extend his hair?

84
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:38,280
It was recent. It isn't a wig.

85
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:41,090
- He was imitating an animal. - What?

86
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,120
- Afghan Hound. - What did you say?

87
00:03:44,127 --> 00:03:45,420
Why would I imitate a dog?

88
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:48,090
- You guys had similar hair. - No.

89
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,300
Yours looked like Han Ki Beom's.

90
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,600
(Detective Han Ki Beom)

91
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:54,100
- What? It's a different style. - It looked like Han Ki Beom's.

92
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:57,140
- It was very long. - This is what I hope for.

93
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,840
I hope that you play basketball.

94
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:01,840
No, I'm not good at it.

95
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,540
- You'll succeed after 10 years. - He's right.

96
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:05,980
- Starting now? - Of course.

97
00:04:05,982 --> 00:04:07,780
- You're only 40. You can do it. - That's what dreams are.

98
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:10,180
- Play the center at 40? - That's possible.

99
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,450
He can do it.

100
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,590
Soccer sounds good too. It's better than being on TV.

101
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,850
What?

102
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:18,520
(You're better at sports than being on TV.)

103
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,860
- Seriously. - I have a main job.

104
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:23,030
(He's flustered.)

105
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:24,660
Is being on TV your main job?

106
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,400
- As a main job, it isn't enough. - What do you mean?

107
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:29,970
(As a main job, it isn't enough.)

108
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,300
I always envied you for being on TV as a hobby.

109
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:35,240
It isn't my hobby. Goodness.

110
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:38,140
So Min is dominating all the commercials.

111
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,480
You should treat all of us.

112
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,410
So Min is moving soon.

113
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,820
- No, not yet. - Is it next year?

114
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,020
Yes, I'll move once the contract is over next year.

115
00:04:46,022 --> 00:04:47,950
Are you moving to a 2 or 3-bedroom apartment?

116
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:51,190
- If I can take out more loans, - Move to a two-bedroom place.

117
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,075
I'll move to a bigger place.

118
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:56,930
That's great. It's great news.

119
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:58,960
- It's good that she moved out. - Actually,

120
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:02,530
a TV that she got as a present is too big for her apartment.

121
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:04,240
That's true.

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,140
It's because the TV is too big.

123
00:05:06,142 --> 00:05:09,710
The TV is too close, but there's no room to move back.

124
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,025
She has to watch TV through a mirror.

125
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:13,650
She has to watch it sideways.

126
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,950
(I'll work hard to buy a bigger house for my TV.)

127
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,320
Today, we have something to recharge you for...

128
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:21,105
- being penalized continuously. - Really?

129
00:05:21,124 --> 00:05:24,520
Today's race is called Invigorating Race.

130
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,720
(Today's race is called Invigorating Race.)

131
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,490
(This is a surprise.)

132
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:32,200
The staff finally started to care about our health.

133
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,185
It has been a long time.

134
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,585
- What is it? - It's eel.

135
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,770
- Eel? - Is there eel?

136
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,540
(The menu is presented.)

137
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,410
- It's food that restores energy. - There's even sturgeon sashimi.

138
00:05:43,413 --> 00:05:44,755
"Sturgeon sashimi"?

139
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:49,550
(Unlike its name, sturgeon sashimi melts in the mouth.)

140
00:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,120
- What's nine-seafood stew? - "Sturgeon sashimi"?

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,335
- There must be nine of something. - That must be it.

142
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:58,775
(9-seafood stew includes 9 types of healthy food.)

143
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,730
I never heard of cold, raw Korean beef soup.

144
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,500
This sushi is really delicious. It's made with seasoned raw beef.

145
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
(Seasoned raw beef sushi)

146
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,030
- What's pink samgyetang? - Pink samgyetang?

147
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,730
- What is it? - What's pink samgyetang?

148
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,640
(Pink samgyetang tastes and looks good.)

149
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,740
- Octopus naengmyeon sounds good. - It sounds delicious.

150
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:17,355
(Octopus naengmyeon is made with octopus in spicy sauce.)

151
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:19,240
Lobster pizza.

152
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:22,825
(Lobster pizza is made with a whole lobster.)

153
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,020
I want some grilled eel.

154
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:28,965
(It's a high-protein meal.)

155
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:32,020
Any place sounds good today.

156
00:06:32,028 --> 00:06:33,945
This is amazing.

157
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,775
Among seven tasty restaurants located in and near Seoul,

158
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:42,830
you may choose a dish that you'd like to eat.

159
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,800
(They get to choose a dish that they want to eat.)

160
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:48,040
Within the five-hour time limit...

161
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,740
(However, there's a 5-hour time limit.)

162
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:53,525
- There can't be a time limit. - Come on.

163
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,410
- Seriously. - My gosh, this is about food.

164
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,720
Within the five-hour time limit,

165
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,050
if the accumulated number of meals by the members...

166
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:02,050
reaches 20, it will count as a success.

167
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:03,665
- 20 meals? - What? The accumulated number?

168
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,420
- 8 of us can finish 20 meals. - We can definitely reach 20 meals.

169
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:07,690
We can finish 20 meals in 5 hours.

170
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,260
Besides, there's no traffic today since it's a holiday.

171
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,430
Be quiet. Be quiet.

172
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:14,030
(Be quiet. Be quiet.)

173
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:16,130
(Seriously?)

174
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,485
Why would you say that?

175
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,740
- Why would you? - I was just saying...

176
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:20,840
Be quiet.

177
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:23,185
Why did you talk? Why?

178
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,955
The director is talking right now. Why are you talking over him?

179
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,020
- I mean... - It's like we're in a class.

180
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,350
Why are we in a class?

181
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:33,480
The class is in session now.

182
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,605
- You shouldn't be talking. - I said, I didn't want to sit here.

183
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,060
I had no idea Jae Seok was going to sit there.

184
00:07:39,062 --> 00:07:40,990
- Exactly. - By the way, be honest.

185
00:07:40,997 --> 00:07:43,005
Which one of us bullies you more?

186
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:45,000
You're asking me to choose which parent I like more.

187
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:48,600
(You're asking me to choose which parent I like more.)

188
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:50,085
Jong Kook bullies you.

189
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,970
I'm just speaking the truth.

190
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:53,555
It's physical bullying against emotional bullying.

191
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:56,125
That's true.

192
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:58,610
However,

193
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:00,880
in the case which you fail to reach the target number...

194
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,580
- We'll accomplish this. - We can finish 20 meals.

195
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,750
We have prepared a cool penalty to remove your fatigue from the heat.

196
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,420
You must complete Running Man's...

197
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,635
water bomb festival to celebrate summer before getting off work.

198
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:14,145
(Everyone must carry out this cool, but humiliating penalty.)

199
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:17,400
My goodness. Today's weather is not that hot today.

200
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,700
You should've asked us to bring extra underwear then.

201
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:20,930
- I didn't bring an extra one. - It will rain in the evening,

202
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,300
but even if it rains, you will still carry it out.

203
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,440
Besides, don't already assume that we'll get the penalty.

204
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:26,770
We can accomplish the mission.

205
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:29,140
It's just that we always end up getting the penalty.

206
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,340
- I immediately thought I'd get it. - It's impossible not to think so.

207
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,110
We'll start with that assumption.

208
00:08:33,116 --> 00:08:36,280
We'll explain the rules when we arrive at the first restaurant.

209
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:38,580
You can freely choose a restaurant and set out.

210
00:08:38,588 --> 00:08:41,190
Since we have five hours, we should go to a clustered area.

211
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,650
Why don't we start with that?

212
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,690
(He targets Jongno-gu which is close from Bomun-dong.)

213
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,420
- Start with restaurants nearby. - Number 4, 5, and 6.

214
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:48,430
Number Five. We're very close to Jongno.

215
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:50,230
- Let's hit Jongno first. - I think that'd be better.

216
00:08:50,233 --> 00:08:51,830
- Let's start with this restaurant. - Number five.

217
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,770
- Let's eat lobster pizza first. - That's right.

218
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,030
- Let's go. - Go.

219
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:56,915
- We'll travel by car. - Okay.

220
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:59,200
My gosh, she doesn't usually serve me breakfast,

221
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,925
but my wife cooked me breakfast today.

222
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,670
(They set out to finish 20 meals.)

223
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:03,980
Why did she cook me breakfast today?

224
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,095
- We have to keep eating today. - That sounds delicious.

225
00:09:07,517 --> 00:09:10,695
(Lobster pizza)

226
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,580
Eels and pizza can taste greasy at times.

227
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,590
- We might not finish our next meal. - That's why...

228
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:17,390
we made the right decision to start with pizza.

229
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,660
- We'll eat the pizza. - After eating something greasy,

230
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,290
- we'll want spicy food. - Exactly.

231
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:23,460
We ought to try sturgeon sashimi.

232
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:25,060
- Let's try what we hadn't tasted. - I've never tried that.

233
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,430
Seok Jin...

234
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,615
is as shameless as a sturgeon.

235
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,800
- He must be brazen. - My goodness.

236
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,270
- "My goodness." - My gosh.

237
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:35,285
- I should've scolded him at 20. - Seok Jin...

238
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:37,925
(Giggling)

239
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:39,495
Hey, we're at Daehangno.

240
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:42,950
- Hey, we're at Daehangno. - Are we going to Daehangno?

241
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:44,820
- My gosh. Really? - Goodness, this area...

242
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:46,420
I have a lot of memories in this neighborhood.

243
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,320
- I haven't been here in a while. - I love it here.

244
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,320
- I went to Marronnier Park a lot. - That park is on the right.

245
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:53,460
Exactly.

246
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,430
- Have you ever seen me there? - Me?

247
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:58,000
I used to drink soju a lot there with a bowl of jjamppong.

248
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,900
- They delivered to the park then. - That's right.

249
00:09:59,902 --> 00:10:02,200
- At that time, artists... - We didn't have money back then.

250
00:10:02,205 --> 00:10:05,415
I had two bags of snacks with a friend who drank a lot.

251
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,940
- I was in a play for kids. - Really?

252
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,270
- A play for kids? - Yes.

253
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:10,440
Kwang Soo, you were in a play for kids?

254
00:10:10,446 --> 00:10:13,440
- But weren't you too tall for that? - What was your role?

255
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:15,865
I was the scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz.

256
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,380
(It's the perfect role for Kwang Soo.)

257
00:10:17,386 --> 00:10:19,235
- You were, weren't you? I knew it. - Seriously?

258
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:21,190
- He made the perfect scarecrow. - That's right.

259
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,835
A bird pooped on me right here.

260
00:10:24,093 --> 00:10:26,205
- Where? - I was standing at the crosswalk.

261
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:28,875
- Really? - I was in a crowd, but I got it.

262
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:31,030
- My gosh. - Weren't you lucky that day?

263
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,300
- No, I was totally unlucky. - The day the bird poop fell on you.

264
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:34,785
I had the worst luck.

265
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:38,340
I've never felt that So Min was lucky.

266
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,315
- She doesn't get lucky at all. - I'm never lucky.

267
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:44,625
Jae Seok, she was lucky that she got to join Running Man.

268
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:46,610
(Impressed)

269
00:10:46,616 --> 00:10:48,325
- That was pretty cool. - You said a great punchline.

270
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,165
- "You said a great punchline." - No, my punch is pretty amazing.

271
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:52,750
(My punch is pretty amazing.)

272
00:10:52,755 --> 00:10:53,890
He said his punch was amazing.

273
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,190
- Let's just skip this. - That's right.

274
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,920
(An absence of a word "line" makes the sentence sound scary.)

275
00:10:56,926 --> 00:10:58,335
- Your punch is strong? - Not punchline.

276
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,175
We're here.

277
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,505
We have arrived. This is the place.

278
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:06,145
Everyone, we have arrived at the first restaurant.

279
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:09,685
Before you enter, let me inform you the additional rules of the race.

280
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:10,900
- I knew it. - There are additional rules?

281
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:12,940
(I'll tell you the additional rules of the race.)

282
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:16,070
Not everyone can taste the invigorating dishes today.

283
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,740
(Not everyone can taste the invigorating dishes today.)

284
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:20,650
- I saw this coming. - You can't do that.

285
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,395
(We saw this coming.)

286
00:11:23,686 --> 00:11:26,450
It's Food Trouble: One Bite Race.

287
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,350
- You can't do this to us. - "One Bite Race"?

288
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,820
Every time you arrive at a restaurant,

289
00:11:29,825 --> 00:11:31,690
you will select a member to represent all of you.

290
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:32,960
- 1 member? - Just 1 member?

291
00:11:32,962 --> 00:11:36,230
The selected member will choose whether three members will...

292
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:39,960
taste the food or six random members will taste the food.

293
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:41,000
- 6 random members? - 6 random members?

294
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:42,600
How will those six random members be chosen?

295
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:44,685
You might not be included in those six random members.

296
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:45,870
- Three members including myself? - It's either playing it safe...

297
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,310
- So two more additional members? - or taking a risk.

298
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,670
I believe that I should be chosen...

299
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,655
as the representative for this restaurant.

300
00:11:51,147 --> 00:11:53,280
- Come on. What? - I believe...

301
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:55,650
(He throws his hat in the ring.)

302
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,250
- That's nonsense. - What?

303
00:11:57,253 --> 00:11:59,520
- You had breakfast. - Why not?

304
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:02,620
- Shouldn't I be chosen for this? - No.

305
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,990
- Then I... - How will we decide?

306
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:05,560
Depending on the decision,

307
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:07,120
the mission will determine who will get to eat the food.

308
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,390
Members who get to taste the food will receive a meal badge.

309
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:10,945
After the race,

310
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,600
only one member with the least badges...

311
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:16,115
will face the penalty if you accomplish the mission.

312
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:18,400
However, if you fail to accomplish the mission,

313
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,955
everyone except the member with the most badges will face it.

314
00:12:21,978 --> 00:12:26,010
- Someone who eats a lot should go. - Exactly.

315
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:27,350
- Someone like me. - Someone like me.

316
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,450
- I can eat the most. - Me too.

317
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:31,550
- I can eat five servings. - I'm always the last one eating.

318
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:34,205
- Don't you agree? - I can eat a lot too.

319
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,620
- If you select me, - Listen.

320
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,820
I'll go with six random members.

321
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:40,435
- We don't need to pick 3 members. - Right. We can get 6 meals.

322
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:41,960
(Smirking)

323
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,130
We don't need to pick three members?

324
00:12:43,132 --> 00:12:44,560
- No, we don't. - You'll choose that.

325
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,930
- I don't think we need to. - I can see it...

326
00:12:45,935 --> 00:12:47,930
in your eyes that you'll choose three members.

327
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:49,585
- I see number 3 in your eyes. - The number 3 is written here.

328
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,640
- Can you see it or not? - You're holding three fingers too.

329
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,270
No, no. This is not it.

330
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:56,770
(He can't conceal his instincts to betray as it's his nature.)

331
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,380
- You already chose three members. - I don't think so.

332
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,055
- You already chose three members. - I'm not thinking that.

333
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,910
How are we going to choose the representative?

334
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:05,020
You can freely decide it among yourselves.

335
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,750
- Let's pick a representative. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

336
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:08,250
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - In that case,

337
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:10,665
Team England and Team Switzerland are sitting together.

338
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:12,560
A member from each team will play rock-paper-scissors.

339
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:14,430
- Okay. - Let's split it into two teams.

340
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,530
We'll play first among us?

341
00:13:15,531 --> 00:13:18,960
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

342
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:20,985
(Haha and Ji Hyo win the 1st round.)

343
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,570
(Haha is the representative of Team Luxury Package.)

344
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,970
Okay. I'm the representative.

345
00:13:23,973 --> 00:13:25,355
I'm the representative.

346
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,955
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

347
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,870
(Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Kwang Soo win the 1st round.)

348
00:13:28,878 --> 00:13:30,285
(Feeling disappointed)

349
00:13:30,479 --> 00:13:31,895
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

350
00:13:32,181 --> 00:13:33,680
(Seok Jin and Jae Seok win the 2nd round.)

351
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,980
- Who won? - Seok Jin and I remain.

352
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:37,365
Rock-paper-scissors

353
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:40,120
(Jae Seok is Team Shuddering Package's representative.)

354
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:41,365
I'm the representative.

355
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:43,990
My gosh, you're copying me again.

356
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:46,890
- My gosh, it's so annoying. - Jae Seok, stop copying him.

357
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:47,930
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

358
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,860
- I'll play rock. - Okay.

359
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:52,260
(There's tension during the final match of rock-paper-scissors.)

360
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:55,030
(Which member will become the representative for lobster pizza?)

361
00:13:55,037 --> 00:13:57,540
(Haha is elected to become the representative.)

362
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,855
Okay.

363
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:00,540
Six of us should eat this.

364
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:02,840
- 6 of us should eat it. - We should start with 6 members.

365
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:03,940
Should I get out of here first?

366
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,180
- Haha. - Hey, hey.

367
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,410
- Haha. - We should start with six members.

368
00:14:06,415 --> 00:14:07,850
- Haha, I'm hungry. - Do it well.

369
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,350
- Hey, hey. - Haha, we should start...

370
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:10,680
- Hey, hey. - We should have a good start.

371
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:12,080
(Haha, are you going to abandon us?)

372
00:14:12,088 --> 00:14:13,650
- I believe in your luck. - Haha.

373
00:14:13,656 --> 00:14:15,250
(Shouting)

374
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:17,405
- Don't forget about the mission. - Okay.

375
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:19,560
- We must finish six meals. - Look me in the eye.

376
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:21,190
Accomplishing the mission matters.

377
00:14:21,197 --> 00:14:23,130
(It's the success of the mission versus the guarantee to eat.)

378
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:26,615
(What is Haha's decision?)

379
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:31,855
(My goodness)

380
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:38,340
(The mix of a plump lobster and pizza makes his jaw drop.)

381
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:43,395
(The freshly-baked lobster pizza makes his heart pound heavily.)

382
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,365
Hold on a second. I should video call them.

383
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:49,420
Jong Kook, show this to the members.

384
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:50,490
Show this to them?

385
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,035
- Let me show you how it looks. - Okay.

386
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:56,205
(They're amazed.)

387
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,230
(The sight of the plump lobster is shown through the phone.)

388
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,085
- Oh, my goodness. - They put the whole lobster on it.

389
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,670
They put the whole lobster on it.

390
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:03,900
- Where are you going? - Where are you going?

391
00:15:03,906 --> 00:15:05,400
(Where are you going?)

392
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:06,440
(How dare you violate the rule?)

393
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:07,925
- He hasn't decided yet. - Where are you going?

394
00:15:08,277 --> 00:15:10,355
Scream if you want to eat this.

395
00:15:10,946 --> 00:15:13,540
(Screaming)

396
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:14,580
Come on.

397
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:16,025
The member who can scream the longest.

398
00:15:16,452 --> 00:15:19,180
(Screaming)

399
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,435
(He screams for 1 second.)

400
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,935
Let's eat!

401
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:26,090
- Jae Seok didn't shout. - Hey.

402
00:15:26,095 --> 00:15:28,860
Jae Seok only pretended to shout.

403
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:30,460
(Jae Seok's silent shouting is exposed too.)

404
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:31,975
- What's wrong with Jae Seok? - Jae Seok didn't shout.

405
00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:34,075
Jae Seok only mouthed it.

406
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,770
Jae Seok can't eat it.

407
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:37,600
(Let me have the lobster pizza with you.)

408
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,040
Okay, okay. Okay.

409
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,440
Okay, okay.

410
00:15:40,442 --> 00:15:41,770
(It's time to make his decision after the shouting.)

411
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:45,425
Haha, the first dish is the lobster pizza.

412
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:48,095
Three members including yourself can taste this dish.

413
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:52,765
Or six random members can taste it. Which one will you choose?

414
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,505
I want everyone to have this if it's possible.

415
00:15:57,126 --> 00:16:00,375
I think Ji Hyo and So Min will love this.

416
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:02,305
Should I set a good example?

417
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:07,700
(Haha makes his decision as the representative.)

418
00:16:07,703 --> 00:16:10,100
- You're all here. - My gosh, this place looks awesome.

419
00:16:10,105 --> 00:16:13,570
- The six of us should eat this. - You don't need to think about it.

420
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:14,840
- Exactly. - Haha, seriously.

421
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,040
Take a seat.

422
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,610
- Please sit down. - My gosh.

423
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:20,580
- I wanted everyone to eat it. - Precisely.

424
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,220
You don't need to think about it.

425
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,780
All right. Haha is the representative.

426
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,705
Between three members including himself...

427
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,935
and six random members...

428
00:16:31,594 --> 00:16:35,390
(It's the team versus the guarantee to eat. Which did he choose?)

429
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:37,390
Haha chose three members including himself to eat the dish.

430
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,700
(Haha chose 3 members including himself to eat the dish.)

431
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:40,930
- Okay. - What?

432
00:16:40,936 --> 00:16:43,130
(What? You chose 3 members to eat this dish?)

433
00:16:43,138 --> 00:16:44,655
- Okay. - What?

434
00:16:45,774 --> 00:16:46,840
Show us your decision with your fingers.

435
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,970
(He was torn during the moment of decision.)

436
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:50,925
(Three people)

437
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:52,710
Three people.

438
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,125
(With swag, he chose 3 people including himself.)

439
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,850
(I want to eat and live well.)

440
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:57,550
Haha, I am disappointed in you.

441
00:16:57,553 --> 00:16:59,650
This is bad. I think we will fail the mission.

442
00:16:59,655 --> 00:17:02,135
- You are less than human. - Don't say that.

443
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:04,420
I swear this is what happened.

444
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:05,790
They asked, "What's your decision?"

445
00:17:05,794 --> 00:17:08,230
I went, "What should I do?" "You chose three people."

446
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,960
They practically decided for me. I am serious.

447
00:17:09,965 --> 00:17:11,030
(What is he saying?)

448
00:17:11,033 --> 00:17:12,900
- Watch this episode later. - Stop lying.

449
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,830
- Your acting skills improved a lot. - I am serious.

450
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,130
I swear.

451
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:17,870
- Haha, I believe you. - Forget it.

452
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:18,900
You believe me, right?

453
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,600
Among the three people,

454
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,940
the two people who aren't the representatives...

455
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:25,325
will be chosen by a mission.

456
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,840
Will there be a mission?

457
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,895
They will be chosen by a mission.

458
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,435
- In any case, I get to eat, right? - That's right.

459
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:35,435
The competition will be fierce.

460
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,890
The mission that determines who gets to eat is...

461
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,160
Food ASMR Quiz.

462
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:41,775
(Food ASMR Quiz)

463
00:17:42,464 --> 00:17:44,900
(Food ASMR Quiz?)

464
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,730
- What is that? - You will hear the sound...

465
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,470
of a cooking process...

466
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:53,070
- and guess what the dish is. - That sounds fun.

467
00:17:53,075 --> 00:17:56,140
The two people who get the answer right the quickest win.

468
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:58,340
- Okay. - We have to answer quickly.

469
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:00,840
- I am good at this. - Me, too. I really like food.

470
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:03,265
I am the ASMR expert.

471
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:08,165
Play the sound of the first dish.

472
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:17,075
(Is it a scraping sound?)

473
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,130
Answer!

474
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:21,770
- You only get one chance. - I know that.

475
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,870
You only get one chance.

476
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:27,670
(What does So Min think the dish is?)

477
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:28,740
A fried egg.

478
00:18:28,744 --> 00:18:33,080
(A fried egg?)

479
00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:34,480
That's it. All right.

480
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:36,810
- You blew your chance. - Okay, okay.

481
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,050
Okay. One person got eliminated.

482
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,120
Play.

483
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,580
(They play the sound again.)

484
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,120
(After the beeping sound,)

485
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:43,550
That the induction cooktop.

486
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,890
(they hear the sizzling sound.)

487
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:46,620
- The induction cooktop. - The buttons were pressed.

488
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:47,620
I have the answer.

489
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:49,890
(Jong Kook raises his hand.)

490
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,300
Spring onion pancake.

491
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,830
- That's it. - Okay, okay.

492
00:18:52,835 --> 00:18:55,000
- 2 people got eliminated. - 2 people got eliminated.

493
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,115
I am almost there. I just need to be patient.

494
00:18:57,473 --> 00:19:00,385
(So Min and Jong Kook are eliminated.)

495
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,155
Something is being deep-fried.

496
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:04,825
It's the sound of oil.

497
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:09,810
Something is being sliced.

498
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,225
I get it now.

499
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:12,735
I get it now.

500
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:15,450
- I got it. Tonkatsu. - He will get eliminated.

501
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:17,790
(Tonkatsu?)

502
00:19:17,793 --> 00:19:19,960
He got eliminated.

503
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,560
(I can't believe it's not tonkatsu getting deep-fried and sliced.)

504
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:23,005
He got eliminated.

505
00:19:23,132 --> 00:19:26,160
I just need three more people to be eliminated.

506
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:27,945
Maybe it would be better to wait until the end.

507
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:31,400
(Is it a scraping sound?)

508
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:32,685
Answer!

509
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:34,415
Bibimbap.

510
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:37,685
- Bibimbap. - I had the same thought.

511
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:44,050
(Isn't it a sound that comes from mixing bibimbap?)

512
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:46,320
(Bibimbap!)

513
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,235
(Incorrect)

514
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:51,575
- He got eliminated. - Three people remain.

515
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:54,120
- He got eliminated. - Three people remain.

516
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,805
(Let's see who gets the answer first.)

517
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,400
(It's a boiling sound.)

518
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:05,955
It's a boiling sound.

519
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:09,555
Answer.

520
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:14,680
(Combining the earlier sounds and the boiling sound...)

521
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:17,365
Tuna kimchi stew.

522
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,995
That can't be the answer.

523
00:20:21,056 --> 00:20:24,250
(Tuna kimchi stew is correct.)

524
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,860
This is how I knew.

525
00:20:26,862 --> 00:20:28,530
We first heard the sound of a can opening.

526
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,705
I waited patiently.

527
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,200
I got goosebumps.

528
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:34,375
We will show you the answer video. He is spot on.

529
00:20:34,837 --> 00:20:36,915
- Look at that. - That was the sound.

530
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,140
Kimchi was stir-fried.

531
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:41,240
- Right. You stir-fry kimchi... - The sound...

532
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,470
in tuna oil.

533
00:20:42,478 --> 00:20:43,970
I thought it was the sound of something getting deep-fried.

534
00:20:43,979 --> 00:20:45,240
(The sound of scraping tuna out of a can)

535
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,740
This part gave me the answer.

536
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:49,110
I thought it was the sound of tonkatsu getting sliced.

537
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,180
This part was confusing.

538
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:52,135
(The sound of slicing an onion)

539
00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:54,420
- That looks delicious. - Okay.

540
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:55,420
(Se Chan becomes the first person.)

541
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:58,020
- Nice. - There is a spot.

542
00:20:58,026 --> 00:20:59,960
- There is a spot. - There is a spot.

543
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,390
One more person will be picked.

544
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,445
- Let's go. - I can do this.

545
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,345
This is the last question. Play.

546
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:10,970
(Is it the sound of cracking eggs?)

547
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:13,255
- Eggs were added. - Beat the eggs.

548
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:14,755
It's not the sound of eggs.

549
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,655
I think about three eggs were added.

550
00:21:17,513 --> 00:21:19,440
It's the third egg.

551
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,440
Answer.

552
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:22,695
(Jong Kook guesses.)

553
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,820
- Rolled omelet. - No way.

554
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,120
It would be too easy, right?

555
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:27,995
Okay. He got eliminated.

556
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:31,050
Okay. Let's be patient.

557
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,720
- I thought it was rolled omelet. - Me, too.

558
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:34,360
I think they were trying to confuse us.

559
00:21:34,363 --> 00:21:35,675
(Maybe it's not the sound of eggs.)

560
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:38,000
(It seems like the sound of beating eggs.)

561
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,260
The eggs are being beaten.

562
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:41,370
(It seems like the sound of beating eggs.)

563
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,470
- The eggs are being beaten. - That's right.

564
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,855
Answer.

565
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:49,770
(Kwang Soo looks confident. What's his answer?)

566
00:21:49,778 --> 00:21:51,085
Gimbap.

567
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,110
- What? - Gimbap.

568
00:21:54,116 --> 00:21:56,050
(That's ridiculous.)

569
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:57,180
That makes no sense.

570
00:21:57,185 --> 00:21:59,020
Your ears are rotten.

571
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,180
You add eggs to gimbap.

572
00:22:01,189 --> 00:22:04,050
- Get your ears checked out. - It's not like that.

573
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,360
That was a ridiculous answer.

574
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,005
You add eggs to gimbap.

575
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:12,160
Since this dish uses a lot of eggs, it could be steamed egg.

576
00:22:12,167 --> 00:22:14,415
You might think that, but that's not the answer.

577
00:22:14,937 --> 00:22:18,045
- It's not steamed egg. - That would be too easy.

578
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:24,880
(What's the answer to this question?)

579
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,855
(It is steamed egg.)

580
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:32,920
(It can't be steamed egg.)

581
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,165
So many eggs are being used.

582
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:37,620
This person's arm must hurt.

583
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,675
(Steamed egg is the answer.)

584
00:22:39,995 --> 00:22:42,690
This person is beating eggs for so long.

585
00:22:42,698 --> 00:22:43,830
Is this person making meringue?

586
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,645
Is this person making castella?

587
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,215
No, no. The sound stopped.

588
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,545
Answer.

589
00:22:49,438 --> 00:22:51,970
Perhaps, I overthought it. It's steamed egg.

590
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,415
No way.

591
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,740
- That's it! - Are you serious?

592
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,140
(Steamed egg is correct.)

593
00:22:57,145 --> 00:22:58,440
We overthought it.

594
00:22:58,447 --> 00:23:01,780
- We overthought it. - Are you serious?

595
00:23:01,783 --> 00:23:04,050
- It was on my mind for a while. - That's right.

596
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:06,850
Since Jae Seok said, "It's not steamed egg,"

597
00:23:06,855 --> 00:23:09,205
no one thought to try the answer.

598
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,120
Steamed egg was on my mind.

599
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:13,790
- That's it. - Steamed egg is an easy answer.

600
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:15,675
Steamed egg.

601
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:18,130
There were no other cooking processes.

602
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,015
(Se Chan, Haha, and Jae Seok get to eat lobster pizza.)

603
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:22,570
(The meaty lobster sits on the pizza and waits for the 3 people.)

604
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:25,070
- It must be tasty. - We should show it...

605
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:26,370
to the viewers.

606
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,655
(Please take a look.)

607
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:30,310
(They can already taste the lobster meat on their tongues.)

608
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:32,395
- It looks so tasty. - The lobster is meaty.

609
00:23:33,048 --> 00:23:36,195
- The lobster is meaty. - Let's put it on the pizza.

610
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:37,480
My goodness.

611
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:39,350
(The sight of lobster meat on the pizza...)

612
00:23:39,354 --> 00:23:40,795
(annoys other people.)

613
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,750
Let's roll it up like gimbap.

614
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,060
(He rolls up the lobster meat with pizza.)

615
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:48,035
(Biting)

616
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,475
Thank you.

617
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:51,645
(My goodness.)

618
00:23:52,501 --> 00:23:53,660
(Eating)

619
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:55,685
I love that the crust is thin.

620
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,140
I will be sure to eat the next dish.

621
00:23:59,141 --> 00:24:00,840
May I drink coke?

622
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:03,025
If you want to drink it, act cute.

623
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:04,455
I won't drink it then.

624
00:24:05,213 --> 00:24:06,410
My goodness.

625
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:07,825
Se Chan!

626
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,750
Se Chan!

627
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:11,780
(Se Chan, please give me a bite.)

628
00:24:11,787 --> 00:24:16,635
Se Chan, So Min wants coke.

629
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,590
That's not the kind of cute act I want to see.

630
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:23,460
Se Chan, So Min is sad. So Min wants coke.

631
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:25,375
(She shakes her shoulders.)

632
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:29,630
(She is the fairy of coke.)

633
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:32,140
When I become the representative,

634
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,470
I promise I will eliminate So Min.

635
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,040
(I promise I will eliminate So Min.)

636
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:39,455
I can't stand this.

637
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:43,810
- Seok Jin. - Come on.

638
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,635
- Let me smell it. - May I eat the mussel?

639
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:47,750
The mussel is...

640
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:50,335
(Maybe there is some meat.)

641
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:52,835
Do you want to hear the ASMR sound?

642
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,630
(Do you want to hear the ASMR sound?)

643
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,945
What?

644
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,845
(That's ASMR.)

645
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:07,170
(Sucking)

646
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:08,240
Answer. It's a bidet.

647
00:25:08,243 --> 00:25:11,255
(It's a bidet.)

648
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:16,225
(It looks tasty, right?)

649
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,465
(There must be some meat left.)

650
00:25:21,556 --> 00:25:22,920
You are hungry, right?

651
00:25:22,924 --> 00:25:25,460
Why don't we play a game...

652
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,620
and give a bite to one person?

653
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,235
- I would love that. - Okay.

654
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,760
I am like Lim Yo Hwan when I come to these games.

655
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:32,860
(Lim Yo Hwan, the professional gamer)

656
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:35,070
When I played a drinking game at a group date,

657
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,330
I never got drunk because I was so good at games.

658
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,570
That means...

659
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:40,200
people gave you water, not alcohol.

660
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,455
(That means people gave you water, not alcohol.)

661
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:45,425
They worried that you would be an annoying drunk.

662
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:48,750
Ji Hyo is the luckiest.

663
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,150
- All right. - My goodness.

664
00:25:50,152 --> 00:25:51,525
- That's incredible. - Yes!

665
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,980
Go ahead.

666
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:55,290
Why don't the rest of you play a game for the last slice?

667
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,420
- I would love that. - Yes!

668
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:57,850
- Another game! - Let's play a different game.

669
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,590
- How about 3-6-9 Game? - 3-6-9 Game.

670
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:02,190
Let's play a new version of 3-6-9 Game.

671
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:04,605
- What is that? - You go, "3, 6, 9, 3, 6, 9."

672
00:26:04,733 --> 00:26:06,545
1, 2.

673
00:26:06,635 --> 00:26:08,630
4, 5.

674
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:09,970
(Each person says a syllable.)

675
00:26:09,971 --> 00:26:12,100
You clap twice for 6 since it has 2 syllables in Korean.

676
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,200
You clap twice.

677
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,970
Let's stand up because it's confusing.

678
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:16,270
We need to focus.

679
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:18,440
- The pizza... - It's tasty.

680
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,840
Let's eat pizza.

681
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,610
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

682
00:26:21,616 --> 00:26:22,610
- 1. - 1.

683
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:23,895
Two.

684
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:25,765
- 4. - 5.

685
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:27,520
Five.

686
00:26:27,522 --> 00:26:28,920
- You are wrong. - You are wrong.

687
00:26:28,924 --> 00:26:31,135
(So Min gets eliminated.)

688
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,190
(So Min gets eliminated because she said the number late.)

689
00:26:34,196 --> 00:26:35,990
(I want pizza.)

690
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:37,390
- Okay. - Let's go.

691
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:38,630
You should have said it faster.

692
00:26:38,633 --> 00:26:41,260
- Let's begin. 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

693
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,630
- 1. - 1.

694
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:43,730
Two.

695
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:45,170
- 4. - 5.

696
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:47,340
- Okay. - Out.

697
00:26:47,342 --> 00:26:50,310
(Jong Kook is eliminated after saying both syllables.)

698
00:26:50,312 --> 00:26:51,940
- You have to say one syllable. - I don't know this game.

699
00:26:51,947 --> 00:26:53,740
- Start. - Okay.

700
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:57,165
(Seok Jin and Kwang Soo have been waiting for this moment.)

701
00:26:58,053 --> 00:26:59,050
Start.

702
00:26:59,054 --> 00:27:02,450
(Say one syllable each time, and the lobster pizza will be yours.)

703
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:04,020
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

704
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:05,705
One.

705
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:07,360
Yes!

706
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:11,160
(Seok Jin confidently says both syllables.)

707
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,945
(Why did I do that?)

708
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:17,570
(Seok Jin, thank you for your mistake.)

709
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:18,885
Seok Jin.

710
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:22,485
- "One"! - I was doing so well.

711
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:25,440
Gosh, I was too worked up.

712
00:27:25,447 --> 00:27:27,755
(The winner, Kwang Soo, wins a piece of pizza.)

713
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,450
I feel too bad. Can't they compete for a glass of coke?

714
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:32,820
- Coke? - Yes, the rest of them.

715
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:35,850
- Let's play 3, 6, 9 again. - Let's stand up.

716
00:27:35,857 --> 00:27:38,705
- So Min is so bad. - I want to win.

717
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,820
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

718
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,375
- 1. - 2.

719
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:44,160
- 4. - 5.

720
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:45,415
Five.

721
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:48,570
- Five. - Sit down.

722
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:51,330
(Jong Kook is the weakest when it comes to drinking games.)

723
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,915
Jong Kook.

724
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:56,470
I'm so bad at games.

725
00:27:56,478 --> 00:27:58,625
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

726
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,155
- 1. - 1.

727
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,340
Two.

728
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,350
- 4. - 5.

729
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
Five.

730
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,350
(Clap)

731
00:28:04,352 --> 00:28:05,950
Seven.

732
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:07,080
You should have clapped your hands.

733
00:28:07,088 --> 00:28:09,750
(He was supposed to clap his hands.)

734
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:11,305
Why did you say, "seven"?

735
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,320
I was going to...

736
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:17,030
- Exchange it for a sip of coke. - Kwang Soo finally gets to eat.

737
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:18,845
Exchange it for a sip of coke.

738
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,915
That looks amazing.

739
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,630
It tastes fantastic.

740
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:24,940
Leave a bite for me.

741
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,470
They'll start craving coke.

742
00:28:26,474 --> 00:28:27,940
You have to eat it with coke.

743
00:28:27,943 --> 00:28:30,055
Okay. Let me take a bite first.

744
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:32,010
- Eat it with coke. - It tastes amazing.

745
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:34,910
Don't eat everything. Please.

746
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,380
(Don't eat everything. Please.)

747
00:28:37,385 --> 00:28:41,150
Please! That jerk.

748
00:28:41,156 --> 00:28:42,320
(That jerk.)

749
00:28:42,324 --> 00:28:45,090
(So Min is so desperate that she calls Kwang Soo a jerk.)

750
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:46,875
Let's do better next time.

751
00:28:47,062 --> 00:28:49,630
What should we eat next?

752
00:28:49,631 --> 00:28:52,230
Let's go have naengmyeon.

753
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,130
We should have some noodles.

754
00:28:54,135 --> 00:28:55,300
Beef sushi.

755
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:58,300
- It sounds so nice. - Let's have beef sushi.

756
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,140
- Should we? - Let's go for beef sushi.

757
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:02,210
- Okay. - Let's get going.

758
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,240
- Let's go! - Let's go!

759
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:04,955
(For the 2nd round, they go for beef sushi.)

760
00:29:05,947 --> 00:29:09,110
I used to come to Daehangno a lot...

761
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:12,550
back in high school and college.

762
00:29:12,554 --> 00:29:14,220
I lived near here.

763
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:16,820
But I couldn't enter many places,

764
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:20,020
and I just remembered why.

765
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,690
- I didn't have money. - Right.

766
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,530
- That's sad. - Right.

767
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:26,800
I used to have a dollar and 50 cents in my pocket.

768
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:27,930
- You? - Yes.

769
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,630
Couldn't you buy a house with that money back in the day?

770
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:33,155
(Couldn't you buy a house with that money back in the day?)

771
00:29:34,843 --> 00:29:37,185
Didn't you carry around shells?

772
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:40,095
Didn't you carry around the Sangpyeongtongbo coins?

773
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:42,080
(I think I've seen him in black-and-white textbooks.)

774
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,425
I remember hanging out in Daehangno.

775
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:47,350
You guys didn't hang out in Jongno District, did you?

776
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:49,265
Are you from the same generation as Kim Du Han?

777
00:29:50,358 --> 00:29:53,320
- Hey. - Have you seen him fight?

778
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:55,630
- Sirasoni... - Back in the day...

779
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,030
- Have you seen him? - Have you?

780
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,460
- He'd knock anyone out. - Really?

781
00:30:00,468 --> 00:30:02,470
- He was amazing. - What about Sirasoni?

782
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,740
I've seen Sirasoni too. He flew, landed, and started eating.

783
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,200
Is he older than you?

784
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:09,640
- What? - Is he older than you?

785
00:30:09,644 --> 00:30:12,080
He was born a few months before me.

786
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,365
(Seok Jin plays along.)

787
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,850
- Is he? - We're two months apart.

788
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,850
Did you get your nickname, Big Nose, then?

789
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:22,490
- Of course. - Big Nose of Jongno District.

790
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,260
He'd sweep the streets of Jongno District with his nose.

791
00:30:26,261 --> 00:30:27,360
He crawled?

792
00:30:27,362 --> 00:30:30,990
The streets of Jongno District used to be so clean...

793
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:32,060
when he was there.

794
00:30:32,067 --> 00:30:34,000
I was the vacuum cleaner of Jongno District.

795
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:36,630
- He swept the streets. - That's right.

796
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:38,330
(The cleaner with a big nose has faded into the mists of history.)

797
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:42,025
Look at Changgyeonggung on the right.

798
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,540
- I... - You got beaten up there?

799
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:45,280
Back in high school...

800
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,440
(You got beaten up there?)

801
00:30:47,449 --> 00:30:49,180
- He got robbed. - He got robbed.

802
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:51,450
- He got beaten up. - Goodness.

803
00:30:51,453 --> 00:30:53,450
- He got robbed? - I really...

804
00:30:53,455 --> 00:30:56,435
like palaces.

805
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:58,250
Maybe I lived in a palace in my previous life.

806
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,890
You must have been a servant.

807
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:02,930
- You must have been a eunuch. - A eunuch.

808
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:05,060
- A eunuch. - He probably was a eunuch.

809
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:07,030
- It suits you. - You guys...

810
00:31:07,035 --> 00:31:10,570
"Your Majesty."

811
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:12,740
- Gosh. - It suits you.

812
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,110
Gosh, you fruit flies.

813
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,740
Doesn't a eunuch taste the king's poop?

814
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:20,640
- Right. - Right.

815
00:31:20,648 --> 00:31:22,650
(Doesn't a eunuch taste the king's poop?)

816
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,750
- To check the king's health. - That's right.

817
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:26,820
That's a eunuch's job.

818
00:31:26,821 --> 00:31:28,720
His hands were unlucky back then too.

819
00:31:28,723 --> 00:31:30,850
(His hands were unlucky back then too.)

820
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:33,320
- Because he ate poop? - He had to touch poop.

821
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:35,930
"It has a golden color today, Your Majesty."

822
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,530
- Gosh. - You were a eunuch.

823
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:40,730
You guys are driving me crazy.

824
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:41,800
(It's a miracle that he got to try the lobster pizza.)

825
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:44,130
You're going to have cold, raw Korean beef soup and beef sushi.

826
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:45,570
- That sounds amazing. - Okay.

827
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:47,370
- You have to pick a representative. - Okay.

828
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,400
Let's pick one.

829
00:31:48,409 --> 00:31:51,085
- Should we play a game? - Okay.

830
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:54,540
Each of you will text someone, "I want to hear your voice."

831
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:57,380
The one who gets a call first will be the representative.

832
00:31:57,385 --> 00:31:59,795
(After texting, the one who gets a call first wins.)

833
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:04,090
Okay. Let's all send it at the same time.

834
00:32:04,092 --> 00:32:05,960
You can't text your family member.

835
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,005
It's cheating if you text a family member.

836
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:09,530
I'll text Jang Do Yeon.

837
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:10,875
- Jang Do Yeon? - Yes.

838
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:13,230
- I'll text Kim Jin Ho. - Kim Jin Ho.

839
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:15,015
I'll text Nam Chang Hee.

840
00:32:16,337 --> 00:32:18,000
(Nam Chang Hee, Shorry, Tae Hang Ho, Lee Jong Hyuk)

841
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:19,955
(Kim Jin Ho, Jang Do Yeon, Lee Sang Yeob)

842
00:32:20,108 --> 00:32:23,070
It has to be fair for everyone.

843
00:32:23,077 --> 00:32:24,710
- Get your phones ready. - Get ready.

844
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:27,025
- 1, 2, 3. - Ready.

845
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:28,710
(They send a message at the same time.)

846
00:32:28,716 --> 00:32:32,150
- Done. - Jong Hyuk. Jong Hyuk!

847
00:32:32,153 --> 00:32:34,280
- Let's go, Sang Yeob! - Jong Hyuk!

848
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,920
- Please. - Sang Yeob.

849
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:37,920
I got a call!

850
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,535
(I got a call!)

851
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:42,430
(Seok Jin gets a call from Jong Hyuk.)

852
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,145
My phone is ringing.

853
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:46,730
(Is this it?)

854
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:48,060
Jong Hyuk.

855
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:51,715
- What is it? - I wanted to hear your voice.

856
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,540
- He's so nice. - He is.

857
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:57,085
- Really? - I love you.

858
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,710
- Are you shooting? - How did you know?

859
00:32:59,714 --> 00:33:01,840
(How did you know?)

860
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,210
Gosh.

861
00:33:03,218 --> 00:33:04,910
My doppelganger although it doesn't make sense.

862
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,580
Jong Hyuk, thank you.

863
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:10,290
- Buy me a meal. - I will.

864
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:11,850
Okay.

865
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,875
- I texted Chang Hee again. - What did you write?

866
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:17,245
"I don't want to hear your voice anymore."

867
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:20,430
(Seok Jin can decide how many will get to eat.)

868
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:22,330
I want my image to change from today.

869
00:33:22,337 --> 00:33:25,270
- I should choose six people... - You should.

870
00:33:25,273 --> 00:33:27,040
You should.

871
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:29,010
- I'll choose six people. - That makes sense.

872
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,910
If Seok Jin chooses three people, things will get weird.

873
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:34,340
- What do you mean? - Stop making things weird.

874
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,750
Change your image.

875
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,750
I don't understand. Why would things get weird?

876
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:40,350
Please cut this part out.

877
00:33:40,355 --> 00:33:42,220
- Because... - Whom are you talking to?

878
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,550
- I'm talking to the director. - What are you talking about?

879
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,020
Please cut this part out for Seok Jin's sake.

880
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:47,460
Seriously...

881
00:33:47,462 --> 00:33:50,560
If you choose three people here, you'll look like a psycho.

882
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:52,030
What?

883
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,100
(You'll look like a psycho.)

884
00:33:53,101 --> 00:33:56,485
I'll look like a psycho? I can't believe him.

885
00:33:56,838 --> 00:34:00,840
He's ridiculous. He's getting on my nerves.

886
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm starting to want to choose three people.

887
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,140
- Let me tell you again. - Let's do this.

888
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,810
- Please cut out this part too. - Please cut it.

889
00:34:07,815 --> 00:34:09,795
I want to hear him out. What is it?

890
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:12,350
- If you choose three people... - I'll look like a psycho?

891
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,565
No.

892
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:16,190
Your career will be jeopardized.

893
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,550
(Your career will be jeopardized.)

894
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:20,890
For your own sake...

895
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,260
- Does he have to retire? - I mean...

896
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:25,560
Say something that makes sense.

897
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,460
Do you think I'm stupid? Stop trying to brainwash me.

898
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,330
- Try to convince me. - Does he have to retire?

899
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,340
He doesn't understand. Please talk to him.

900
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,955
Seok Jin will be too scared not to choose six people now.

901
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,810
It'll start to bother him as time goes by.

902
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:40,295
- Right. - "Will my career be jeopardized?"

903
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:43,950
Things will seriously get weird.

904
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,850
- Fine, I'll do it right. - Okay.

905
00:34:45,853 --> 00:34:47,480
We're here.

906
00:34:47,488 --> 00:34:49,320
- I know this place. - You do?

907
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:52,490
- It's this place? - Will I get to eat?

908
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:53,775
(Beef sushi)

909
00:34:53,828 --> 00:34:54,890
Gosh.

910
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:56,475
(Cold, raw Korean beef soup)

911
00:34:56,998 --> 00:34:58,030
(It's decision-making time.)

912
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:02,000
3 people including you or 6 randomly chosen people?

913
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,000
(He has to make a choice.)

914
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:04,845
I need to see the big picture.

915
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,000
Who am I? I'm the oldest member.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

916
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:09,770
(What will the oldest member who sees the big picture choose?)

917
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:11,270
Gosh, look at that.

918
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,540
(The other 7 members arrive.)

919
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:14,395
Look at that.

920
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:15,910
- What's that? - Is it real food?

921
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,150
- So this is what we'll eat. - It looks delicious.

922
00:35:18,152 --> 00:35:21,165
- It's Korean beef. - Please, Seok Jin.

923
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:25,560
Dear our captain

924
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,290
- Go, Seok Jin - Go, Seok Jin

925
00:35:31,299 --> 00:35:33,300
- Go, Seok Jin - You've made your decision, right?

926
00:35:33,301 --> 00:35:36,000
- We don't have to butter him up. - We don't.

927
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,470
- That's why I've been quiet. - Have you made your decision?

928
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:40,470
- Yes. - Seok Jin...

929
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,940
chose between three people including him...

930
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:45,810
and six randomly chosen people.

931
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:47,055
(3 people versus 6 people)

932
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:51,425
(What did Seok Jin choose?)

933
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:53,550
He chose six randomly chosen people.

934
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:57,090
(6 randomly chosen people)

935
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:59,190
(This is the oldest member's big picture.)

936
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:00,475
Really?

937
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:03,060
(He was torn between the two choices.)

938
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:04,830
- I choose 6 people. - 6 randomly chosen people?

939
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,975
- You might not get to eat. - I'll probably get to eat too.

940
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,215
I doubt that I won't get to eat.

941
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:12,540
(A ray of sunshine among all the betrayals and lies)

942
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,240
I really...

943
00:36:14,242 --> 00:36:16,440
- told myself, - Seok Jin...

944
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:18,010
"I'm the oldest member."

945
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,310
(I'm the oldest member.)

946
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:21,110
I wanted to let you guys eat.

947
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:22,550
Jae Seok.

948
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,020
(Praise Seok Jin!)

949
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,550
- Seok Jin - Seok Jin

950
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,150
Let me correct something you said.

951
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:32,260
I really appreciate your choice.

952
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,890
- It's really admirable. - Yes.

953
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:36,630
But I'm the leader of Running Man.

954
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:38,330
What?

955
00:36:38,332 --> 00:36:39,730
You're just the oldest member.

956
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:42,330
I think it's because you told him...

957
00:36:42,336 --> 00:36:44,630
his career would be jeopardized.

958
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,670
(That was probably why.)

959
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,300
- It was because of Jae Seok. - You're right.

960
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:50,010
He's very scared.

961
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:52,240
I didn't know that he was a coward.

962
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:57,780
(Seok Jin couldn't simply ignore Jae Seok's warning.)

963
00:36:57,785 --> 00:36:59,380
Cowards recognize each other.

964
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:00,450
Anyway,

965
00:37:00,455 --> 00:37:03,450
remember what I said before we got off the bus.

966
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:06,990
I sacrificed myself for the greater good.

967
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:09,460
Seok Jin made a big decision.

968
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:10,830
He acts like our big brother.

969
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:14,130
This mission determines six members who will get to eat.

970
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:16,600
- It's called Strange Buzzer Quiz. - "Strange Buzzer"?

971
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:18,600
Listen to questions related to food.

972
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:23,455
The first member to ring the buzzer indicated by the staff answers.

973
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:26,955
You receive a meal badge in the order of answering questions.

974
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:30,065
The first buzzer is lemon.

975
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:33,350
Eat half of a lemon whole.

976
00:37:33,354 --> 00:37:37,105
If you answer the question accurately in five seconds, you win.

977
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:40,375
- I just imagined the taste. - Lemon is difficult.

978
00:37:40,828 --> 00:37:42,090
It's already sour.

979
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:47,175
What's the origin of dried laver that we often eat?

980
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:51,670
One, the last name of the person who first grew dried laver.

981
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:55,340
Two, the shape of long laver that grows deep in the sea.

982
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:59,580
Three, its smoke-like movement under the sea.

983
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,650
Four, the last name of the king who enjoyed eating dried laver.

984
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,295
Answer.

985
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,295
Go ahead.

986
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,865
Read the question, and answer it accurately.

987
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:11,435
- "Read the question"? - That's right.

988
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:13,290
He lost.

989
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:14,535
Start.

990
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,490
Poor Kwang Soo.

991
00:38:16,497 --> 00:38:17,960
(He must answer in 5 seconds.)

992
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,175
Read the question.

993
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:20,330
- Two. - Goodness.

994
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,460
He won't make it.

995
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,600
- Three. - Goodness.

996
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,330
- He looks so ugly. - Four.

997
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:26,600
(Looking at him makes my mouth water.)

998
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,440
(He exceeds the time limit.)

999
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,725
It makes my mouth water.

1000
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:31,470
Do we have to read the question?

1001
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:33,195
Read the question, and say the answer.

1002
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:35,325
I can't do it.

1003
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,150
- It's impossible. - One.

1004
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:38,410
- Goodness. - Two.

1005
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,035
That's so dirty.

1006
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:41,495
(He mumbles.)

1007
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,020
(They're two ugly brothers.)

1008
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,820
Answer!

1009
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:47,720
(Se Chan gives it a try since he's used to eating lemon.)

1010
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,160
- How can we do it? - What's this?

1011
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,375
(Screaming)

1012
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:55,630
(Everyone is getting invigorated.)

1013
00:38:55,636 --> 00:38:58,285
It's impossible. Anyone who can do it deserves respect.

1014
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:01,770
"What's the origin of dried laver that we often eat?"

1015
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:04,625
"Three, its smoke-like movement under the sea."

1016
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:08,710
(Haha barely finished saying it. Is his answer correct?)

1017
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:09,710
(Number 3 is wrong.)

1018
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:10,850
- Answer. - That's wrong.

1019
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,535
(He fails.)

1020
00:39:15,323 --> 00:39:17,365
(What's this?)

1021
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:20,460
(What's her answer among the 3 remaining choices?)

1022
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:23,345
"Four, the last name of the king who enjoyed eating dried laver."

1023
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:24,960
(Number 4 is also wrong.)

1024
00:39:24,966 --> 00:39:26,300
Answer.

1025
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,800
(The second time should be better. He spits it out.)

1026
00:39:28,803 --> 00:39:31,185
- Goodness. - That's dirty.

1027
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,485
(It's more painful for those who are watching.)

1028
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,410
(He embarrasses himself more.)

1029
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:39,925
- What is it? - Answer!

1030
00:39:43,484 --> 00:39:46,395
(It's a waterfall of vitamin C.)

1031
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:49,705
(He burps.)

1032
00:39:49,724 --> 00:39:52,135
- He's making dinosaur sounds. - Answer.

1033
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:54,805
(While everyone is being energized...)

1034
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,160
"What's the origin of dried laver that we often eat?"

1035
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:00,230
"One, the last name of the person who first grew dried laver."

1036
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:01,560
(Se Chan's answer is number 1.)

1037
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:02,570
That's not it.

1038
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,945
(Number one is not it.)

1039
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,715
(Se Chan answers correctly.)

1040
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:10,840
(Se Chan's vitamin C party is finally over.)

1041
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,085
It's so sour.

1042
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,095
I can't even focus.

1043
00:40:14,382 --> 00:40:17,895
Kim Yeo Ik successfully grew dried laver in 1640.

1044
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,180
- We'll give Se Chan a meal badge. - Yes!

1045
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:22,320
Se Chan got it.

1046
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:23,665
He got it.

1047
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:26,735
(It's the second question.)

1048
00:40:27,395 --> 00:40:32,445
(Jae Seok wins a meal ticket and a meal badge.)

1049
00:40:33,034 --> 00:40:36,145
Next question's buzzer is water.

1050
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:39,100
- Water will be easy enough. - If you know the answer,

1051
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:41,770
call out and put a cup on your head.

1052
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:45,370
The member to pour the water closest to the red line answers.

1053
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:46,755
You say when to stop.

1054
00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:49,710
This is why we needed an extra pair of underwear.

1055
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:52,325
- Get wet before answering. - Goodness.

1056
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:53,880
We have four spots left. Please try hard.

1057
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:56,065
I haven't gotten a meal badge yet.

1058
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,190
You should be included.

1059
00:40:58,192 --> 00:40:59,790
- I should, right? - Yes.

1060
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:01,260
I made a sacrifice.

1061
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:02,905
Do you understand?

1062
00:41:03,364 --> 00:41:04,690
Here's your question.

1063
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,030
Which of the following...

1064
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:09,785
- is a good food pairing? - I know all about this.

1065
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:12,385
One, tomato and sugar.

1066
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,555
Two, beef and butter.

1067
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,455
Three, bread and orange juice.

1068
00:41:17,545 --> 00:41:19,610
- No. - Four, abalone and chicken.

1069
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:20,895
Answer!

1070
00:41:21,115 --> 00:41:23,165
- What's the answer? - I definitely know it.

1071
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:24,880
- You know it? - Here I go.

1072
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:28,120
(He must say stop once the water reaches the line.)

1073
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,105
(He's completely focused.)

1074
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:34,735
(Haha goes for the red line without any hesitation.)

1075
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:39,775
(The water went over the line.)

1076
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:41,900
Stop.

1077
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:43,785
(He says stop after getting wet.)

1078
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,300
(He gets ugly for the 2nd time.)

1079
00:41:46,307 --> 00:41:47,755
"Stop."

1080
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:49,655
This is so difficult.

1081
00:41:50,177 --> 00:41:52,980
(He becomes a piece of wet laver.)

1082
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,525
Answer.

1083
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:55,925
That must feel cool.

1084
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,050
I definitely know the answer.

1085
00:41:58,052 --> 00:41:59,795
I do too.

1086
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,590
(She's completely focused.)

1087
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,535
(Everyone holds their breaths and watches her.)

1088
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,990
(The water flows over the line again.)

1089
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:09,345
Isn't it full yet?

1090
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:11,305
No way.

1091
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:13,115
- Answer. - Answer.

1092
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,230
(While people get wet, Kwang Soo raises his hand.)

1093
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:17,215
- It's Kwang Soo. - Don't even pour it.

1094
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,970
Where's the cup?

1095
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,870
(The cup keeps avoiding the water.)

1096
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:24,455
Where's the cup? Hold on.

1097
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:26,380
Pour it carefully.

1098
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,440
- Where is it? - Kwang Soo.

1099
00:42:27,448 --> 00:42:28,480
(The cup keeps moving away.)

1100
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,025
- What's going on? - Pour it carefully.

1101
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,710
Pour it toward the side.

1102
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,165
Toward the front.

1103
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,880
- What's going on? - Kwang Soo.

1104
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,390
(He fails as he runs out of water.)

1105
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:39,560
You only got this much. You're so silly.

1106
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,090
- Answer. - You're frustrating, Kwang Soo.

1107
00:42:42,096 --> 00:42:44,230
- Who's next? - He's frustrating.

1108
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,645
Hold the cup for her.

1109
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:49,175
(He holds it carefully.)

1110
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,300
You can't look.

1111
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:52,645
Wait.

1112
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:54,970
- Get ready. - Don't act foolishly.

1113
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,170
What?

1114
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:58,710
(She says it out of the blue.)

1115
00:42:58,712 --> 00:42:59,740
What did I do?

1116
00:42:59,747 --> 00:43:00,980
What did I do wrong?

1117
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:03,380
- What do you mean? - What did I do?

1118
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:05,280
- "Act foolishly"? - What do you mean?

1119
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:06,995
- You're being harsh. - That's right.

1120
00:43:07,488 --> 00:43:09,080
Don't blame Kwang Soo.

1121
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:10,665
I was holding it still.

1122
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:13,390
(As Kwang Soo acts foolishly, So Min starts to pour.)

1123
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,635
Start.

1124
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:18,305
(She pours carefully.)

1125
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:19,900
- Where is it? - That's cold.

1126
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,230
It's cold.

1127
00:43:21,235 --> 00:43:22,300
So Min.

1128
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:25,330
(She pours it all over Kwang Soo's arm.)

1129
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,140
(They're the funniest pair.)

1130
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:28,415
Hurry up.

1131
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,285
- Stop. - What are you doing?

1132
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,070
Where is it?

1133
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,295
(She pours it on Kwang Soo's armpit without filling half the cup.)

1134
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,695
(His seat is soaked.)

1135
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:39,165
What happened?

1136
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,280
Why didn't it get filled?

1137
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:42,380
(It's unfair how Kwang Soo got wet.)

1138
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:45,590
(He really starts to act foolishly.)

1139
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:48,820
(He pours the rest of the water into his cup.)

1140
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:53,200
(He fills it up to the red line by taking someone else's water.)

1141
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,800
You're a cheater.

1142
00:43:54,802 --> 00:43:56,000
- Give it back. - What?

1143
00:43:56,003 --> 00:43:57,400
- What are you doing? - What's wrong?

1144
00:43:57,404 --> 00:44:00,415
He filled up the cup and is going to put it in the kettle.

1145
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:03,270
- We'll change his kettle. - Okay.

1146
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:06,010
(Kwang Soo's foolish act fails.)

1147
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,355
- Answer. - Here you go.

1148
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:10,010
I'll do it for you.

1149
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:12,380
(He feels bad for getting him soaked.)

1150
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:14,720
(Apologetic Jae Seok makes a deal with Kwang Soo.)

1151
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:16,520
- Answer. - It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1152
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:17,850
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo's time for teamwork)

1153
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,235
I'll get it.

1154
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:21,590
I think I know now.

1155
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,375
(He pretends to be careful.)

1156
00:44:25,966 --> 00:44:28,000
(What happened?)

1157
00:44:28,002 --> 00:44:30,885
(Water comes out only a little.)

1158
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:35,140
(The kettle is too light.)

1159
00:44:35,142 --> 00:44:36,525
(He runs out of water.)

1160
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:40,695
(The water isn't enough.)

1161
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,010
(Come on.)

1162
00:44:43,017 --> 00:44:45,025
I took away too much water from your kettle.

1163
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,780
Will you keep doing this?

1164
00:44:46,787 --> 00:44:48,935
- Will you keep doing this? - I took away too much.

1165
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,290
- Answer. - Let's continue.

1166
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:52,905
- Isn't that it? - No.

1167
00:44:54,762 --> 00:44:56,105
Stop.

1168
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:58,775
Did I get it? That's amazing.

1169
00:44:59,033 --> 00:45:00,860
I followed my senses.

1170
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,200
- Four, abalone and chicken. - That's right.

1171
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,615
That should be the answer.

1172
00:45:04,638 --> 00:45:07,100
(Haha answers correctly.)

1173
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:09,570
Listen, everyone.

1174
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:12,910
- People are taking the meal badges. - Wasn't I amazing?

1175
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:14,240
How did I get it?

1176
00:45:14,248 --> 00:45:17,495
Everyone, I'm not included yet.

1177
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:19,780
Do you remember what I said?

1178
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:21,920
- There are 3 spots left. - 3 spots? That's right.

1179
00:45:21,922 --> 00:45:23,650
- Please work hard, everyone. - Okay.

1180
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:24,720
There are still three spots.

1181
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:26,460
I made the decision because I trust you.

1182
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,160
Please clap for the main member today.

1183
00:45:28,162 --> 00:45:29,560
(Clap for the main member today.)

1184
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:30,860
- Do you understand? - That's great.

1185
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,705
Please do what I say.

1186
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:34,845
Next buzzer is...

1187
00:45:34,935 --> 00:45:36,530
pulling sideburns.

1188
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:38,870
- This is hard too. - The person next to you pulls.

1189
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,670
- Endure it for 5 seconds. - 5 seconds?

1190
00:45:41,675 --> 00:45:44,425
- Please go easy on me. - Okay.

1191
00:45:44,645 --> 00:45:46,610
If you do it while I shout out the answer,

1192
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:48,095
I'll tear it apart.

1193
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:50,325
That's too harsh.

1194
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:51,680
- Don't tear them. - I can't stand it.

1195
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:53,035
I have to eat.

1196
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,420
Why did you change your seat?

1197
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,690
(What's going on?)

1198
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,120
I couldn't participate easily as I was sitting at the edge.

1199
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:01,305
- You said that you'll tear it. - I got closer.

1200
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:02,875
Goodness.

1201
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,630
- Jong Kook is being more active. - Right.

1202
00:46:05,632 --> 00:46:07,575
We don't have many chances left.

1203
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:10,315
- I'll be more active. - Let's start.

1204
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,155
In "The Smurfs",

1205
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:18,670
the word "smurf" originates from a word that was mispronounced by...

1206
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:23,280
cartoonist Peyo while eating lunch. He couldn't remember the right word.

1207
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:26,220
What's the word? One, salt.

1208
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,020
Two, soy sauce.

1209
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,720
Three, sugar.

1210
00:46:29,723 --> 00:46:31,335
Four, sesame seeds.

1211
00:46:31,992 --> 00:46:33,335
Answer.

1212
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,160
Pull his sideburns.

1213
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:36,590
- Do I pull them? - Endure it for five seconds.

1214
00:46:36,597 --> 00:46:38,045
Isn't it either side?

1215
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:39,860
Which side should it be?

1216
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:41,460
It doesn't matter which side.

1217
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:43,130
- Just pull his sideburns. - What?

1218
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,115
His hairstyle will be flattop.

1219
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:47,740
- I'm good at standing pain. - Ready.

1220
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:50,040
(I'll stand the pain and say the answer.)

1221
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:51,325
Start.

1222
00:46:53,981 --> 00:46:55,925
(He screams right away.)

1223
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,050
- Answer! - Answer.

1224
00:46:58,052 --> 00:46:59,480
The person next to you will pull your sideburns.

1225
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,820
For five seconds? I'm really good at standing pain.

1226
00:47:01,822 --> 00:47:03,305
(Do as you like.)

1227
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:05,090
- Hey! - What?

1228
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:06,190
You're supposed to pull my sideburns!

1229
00:47:06,193 --> 00:47:07,660
I'm really good at standing pain.

1230
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:08,860
- Hey! - What?

1231
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,190
- My sideburns... - My hands are too big.

1232
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:11,560
- He... - My hands are just too big.

1233
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:13,400
grabbed the hair on the side of my head.

1234
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,430
- Stop him. - I have big hands.

1235
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:16,670
Did you see that?

1236
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,100
Let me just try. I'll let go when you tell me to.

1237
00:47:18,105 --> 00:47:19,200
I'll do that.

1238
00:47:19,206 --> 00:47:21,170
- Gosh. Okay. - It won't hurt that much.

1239
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:22,455
Does it hurt?

1240
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,110
- I can do this, right? - Hold on.

1241
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:27,455
Hey, ask the others!

1242
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:29,180
Is this not okay?

1243
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,310
Is this not allowed?

1244
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,050
That's not my sideburns.

1245
00:47:32,052 --> 00:47:33,520
That's not okay.

1246
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,120
- It's not? - Don't go overboard.

1247
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:37,150
Don't go overboard.

1248
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,990
- I'll stop. - It's just too much.

1249
00:47:38,992 --> 00:47:41,375
I won't do it if it's too much.

1250
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:43,505
Ready.

1251
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:45,890
Start.

1252
00:47:45,899 --> 00:47:48,800
1, 2, 3,

1253
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,330
- I don't feel anything. - 4, 5.

1254
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:51,600
That was nothing.

1255
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:53,585
You really didn't feel anything?

1256
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:54,970
(Are you really okay?)

1257
00:47:54,975 --> 00:47:57,470
- Your hair got pulled out. - I didn't feel anything.

1258
00:47:57,478 --> 00:48:00,155
(Even though your hair got pulled out?)

1259
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,540
You really didn't feel anything?

1260
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,310
- Your hair got pulled out. - I didn't feel anything.

1261
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:07,020
- What's your answer? - Number four, "sesame".

1262
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,080
- "Sesame". - I was going to say that.

1263
00:48:08,088 --> 00:48:09,905
Number four, "sesame".

1264
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,250
- It's wrong. - Answer!

1265
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:12,390
Ji Hyo.

1266
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:13,490
Soy sauce...

1267
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:15,105
Start.

1268
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,330
- It must hurt. - 1, 2, 3,

1269
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:19,760
4, 5.

1270
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,100
It must have hurt a lot.

1271
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:22,600
Are you crazy?

1272
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:24,530
I'm sorry. It's just a game.

1273
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:26,470
It must have hurt a lot, but she put up with it.

1274
00:48:26,473 --> 00:48:27,600
What?

1275
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:28,640
It hurt.

1276
00:48:28,642 --> 00:48:30,540
(Ji Hyo gets to answer.)

1277
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:31,810
Just take a guess.

1278
00:48:31,812 --> 00:48:33,125
Answer.

1279
00:48:35,115 --> 00:48:36,595
Two, soy sauce.

1280
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:38,210
Two, soy sauce.

1281
00:48:38,218 --> 00:48:39,310
(Wrong)

1282
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,520
Say, "Answer!"

1283
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:42,495
Answer!

1284
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:44,820
Okay.

1285
00:48:44,825 --> 00:48:46,920
- Okay. You know... - I know.

1286
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,920
You remember my promise, right?

1287
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:51,530
- Of course. - You know how we got here, right?

1288
00:48:51,532 --> 00:48:52,775
Of course.

1289
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:56,345
I'll pretend it hurts. Just pull it slightly.

1290
00:48:56,837 --> 00:48:58,370
But you're not supposed to show that it hurts.

1291
00:48:58,372 --> 00:48:59,815
- Start. - Start.

1292
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:01,200
(Gosh)

1293
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,485
Hey!

1294
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,325
Start.

1295
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,840
(Gosh)

1296
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:08,080
(He is the symbol of sacrifice.)

1297
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,210
Answer!

1298
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:11,810
You should have put up with it.

1299
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:13,135
(You should have put up with it.)

1300
00:49:13,453 --> 00:49:14,780
He should've put up with it.

1301
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:16,390
- Pull his sideburns. - Me?

1302
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,435
- The other side. - He should've put up with it.

1303
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:19,860
Ready.

1304
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,390
(Pinching)

1305
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:23,390
- What are you doing? - I can't pick up his sideburns.

1306
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:24,860
Are you going to pull my skin off?

1307
00:49:24,865 --> 00:49:28,230
- Your sideburns... - I won't feel anything anyway.

1308
00:49:28,235 --> 00:49:30,670
- He doesn't seem to feel pain. - I don't.

1309
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:31,870
Start.

1310
00:49:31,872 --> 00:49:33,715
- It doesn't hurt, seriously. - 1, 2,

1311
00:49:33,774 --> 00:49:34,970
- three, - It doesn't hurt?

1312
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,970
- It's really okay? - four,

1313
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,040
- I'm totally fine. - five.

1314
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:38,740
- Your skin is red. - I didn't feel anything.

1315
00:49:38,745 --> 00:49:40,280
- It's so red. - Your answer?

1316
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,480
It's either of the two.

1317
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:42,755
Number one.

1318
00:49:43,483 --> 00:49:45,325
- "Salt". - Number one, "salt".

1319
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:47,565
Okay.

1320
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,080
It's "salt"?

1321
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:51,390
I thought it was "sesame".

1322
00:49:51,391 --> 00:49:53,135
There are two seats left.

1323
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,505
- There are two seats left. - I have to get in.

1324
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,030
- You remember, right? - Stop it.

1325
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,530
- There are only 2 seats left. - There are 2 seats left.

1326
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:02,970
There are only two seats left.

1327
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,300
Let's give a big hand to today's star, Seok Jin.

1328
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:08,200
We're playing this game thanks to him.

1329
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,740
We can do this, right?

1330
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:11,040
(There are only two seats left.)

1331
00:50:11,044 --> 00:50:12,585
Here goes the question.

1332
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:16,750
Which of the four is classified as food waste?

1333
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,350
I definitely know it.

1334
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,250
I'm sure I know it.

1335
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:22,950
I actually separate the garbage.

1336
00:50:22,956 --> 00:50:25,365
Number one, "onion skins".

1337
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:28,135
Number two, "egg shells".

1338
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,560
Number three, "tangerine peels".

1339
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:32,905
Number four, "corn husks".

1340
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:35,530
Answer!

1341
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:36,915
Sideburns.

1342
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:38,000
- Seok Jin. - I'm confused.

1343
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:39,545
You know this.

1344
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:40,870
- I know this. - Ready.

1345
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:43,010
Start.

1346
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,025
1, 2, 3...

1347
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:48,310
(It hurts just by watching.)

1348
00:50:48,315 --> 00:50:49,910
4, 5.

1349
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,480
Gosh.

1350
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:53,080
How did she stand it?

1351
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:55,365
- Ji Hyo is amazing. - It must have hurt a lot.

1352
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,320
Which is classified as food waste?

1353
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:58,835
Number three, "tangerine peels".

1354
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:02,335
- Number three, "tangerine peels". - That's wrong.

1355
00:51:02,362 --> 00:51:04,490
(Ji Hyo passes.)

1356
00:51:04,498 --> 00:51:05,930
I'm good at housekeeping.

1357
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:07,445
Really?

1358
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,200
It's not "corn husks"?

1359
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:11,270
- I didn't know. - Tangerine peels are food waste.

1360
00:51:11,271 --> 00:51:12,400
(But now...)

1361
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,540
Guys, there's only one spot left.

1362
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,870
What should we do?

1363
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:16,870
(Without realizing...)

1364
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,070
Guys.

1365
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,880
- Our dream will come true? - Our last spot.

1366
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,955
He's today's star.

1367
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:24,350
- Guys. - We're really thankful.

1368
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:26,850
We left the last spot for you.

1369
00:51:26,853 --> 00:51:29,165
I can't believe that I'm left with these two. Guys.

1370
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:30,965
Okay?

1371
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:32,650
This is crazy.

1372
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:34,890
There are three people left.

1373
00:51:34,895 --> 00:51:37,990
Let me ask you something. Who's been to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

1374
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:39,430
(Me)

1375
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,045
Who's been to Australia?

1376
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,715
Who is going to the UK?

1377
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:44,545
It turned out this way.

1378
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:48,000
Okay. If I can't even beat these two...

1379
00:51:48,008 --> 00:51:49,710
Okay.

1380
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,070
I can do this.

1381
00:51:51,078 --> 00:51:52,810
- You can sit in the middle. - Okay.

1382
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:54,755
Pull my sideburns.

1383
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,210
It's finals.

1384
00:51:57,217 --> 00:51:58,895
He just swore.

1385
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:01,495
I think you could hear it.

1386
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:02,980
- What did he say? - What did he say?

1387
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,435
While shooting...

1388
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:07,035
(Seok Jin swore.)

1389
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:09,160
(Why did you swear?)

1390
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:10,460
Seok Jin!

1391
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,460
- Seriously? - I didn't.

1392
00:52:12,466 --> 00:52:14,400
- I didn't. - How could you do that?

1393
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:15,700
Don't swear.

1394
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,570
- Don't swear. - What did we do wrong?

1395
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:19,100
I was just...

1396
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:21,640
so frustrated by the situation.

1397
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,140
Think about it.

1398
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,340
I gave six people a chance.

1399
00:52:25,345 --> 00:52:28,110
They said they'd let me eat.

1400
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:31,750
I can't believe I ended up here.

1401
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:33,750
- You're today's star. - I can't help but laugh.

1402
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:35,720
You're today's star, so you have to remain.

1403
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:37,635
The person next to you will pull your sideburns.

1404
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:41,460
Which of these four is considered to be a bad combination?

1405
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:42,760
- I don't know this. - I know.

1406
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:43,790
A bad combination?

1407
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:46,275
Number one, "makgeolli and green onion pancakes".

1408
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,060
- It's too... - Number two, "naengmyeon and meat".

1409
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:52,330
Number three, "sweet potatoes and kimchi".

1410
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,555
Number four, "pork belly and soju".

1411
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:55,970
- Answer! - Answer! I know this one.

1412
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:58,240
Five seconds. Ready.

1413
00:52:58,245 --> 00:52:59,440
(Please fail.)

1414
00:52:59,446 --> 00:53:01,340
Start.

1415
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,610
(Seok Jin uses all the strength he has.)

1416
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:04,710
2, 3, 4,

1417
00:53:04,718 --> 00:53:06,420
- five. - Done.

1418
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,465
How did you stand it?

1419
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:14,735
It hurts so much every week.

1420
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,890
It hurts so much every week.

1421
00:53:16,897 --> 00:53:18,330
(It hurts because you're young.)

1422
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,605
Every week...

1423
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:21,245
(I'm sorry, Kwang Soo.)

1424
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,760
Naengmyeon.

1425
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:26,800
- "Pork belly and soju". - No!

1426
00:53:26,807 --> 00:53:28,470
- It's correct. - No!

1427
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:30,010
- It's better with beer. - No way!

1428
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,485
It can't be right.

1429
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,710
(It's the last chance.)

1430
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:37,010
- "Pork belly and soju". - No!

1431
00:53:37,017 --> 00:53:38,110
No!

1432
00:53:38,118 --> 00:53:40,195
- Okay! - No!

1433
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,865
(No!)

1434
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,835
(Kwang Soo is the last person to win a meal badge.)

1435
00:53:48,929 --> 00:53:50,290
It's a bad combination.

1436
00:53:50,297 --> 00:53:52,130
- The rest of you... - Okay!

1437
00:53:52,132 --> 00:53:53,375
Okay!

1438
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,030
- Why me? - How can you do this to me?

1439
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:56,900
- Guys. - Thank you.

1440
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:59,130
- Don't you have something to say? - Okay.

1441
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,500
- Thank you. - Say something to me.

1442
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:01,940
When you get penalized...

1443
00:54:01,942 --> 00:54:03,270
Thank you.

1444
00:54:03,276 --> 00:54:04,340
Say something to me.

1445
00:54:04,344 --> 00:54:06,440
So Min is so bad at games.

1446
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:08,225
(The 6 people get meal badges.)

1447
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:10,295
Gosh, the food is here.

1448
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:11,880
(Cold, raw Korean beef soup and Korean beef sushi)

1449
00:54:11,885 --> 00:54:13,280
This is the best.

1450
00:54:13,286 --> 00:54:14,550
It looks fantastic.

1451
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:16,020
It looks amazing. I've never tried it.

1452
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:17,735
It tastes really good.

1453
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,720
Gosh.

1454
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:21,935
- Are we supposed to add noodles? - Yes.

1455
00:54:23,697 --> 00:54:24,975
It tastes amazing.

1456
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:27,260
It's delicious.

1457
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,600
(The Korean beef will replenish their energy.)

1458
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:32,030
The world is full of betrayals.

1459
00:54:32,038 --> 00:54:33,955
There's no point in being nice to others.

1460
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:38,125
- This is how the world works. - That's right.

1461
00:54:38,645 --> 00:54:40,395
- It tastes great. - It does.

1462
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:44,080
It feels like the summer is over. It's so nice and refreshing.

1463
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:47,220
(Cold, raw Korean beef soup makes you forget the heat.)

1464
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,320
I can't believe that I didn't get to eat.

1465
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:51,490
- All right. - I really don't understand.

1466
00:54:51,491 --> 00:54:53,360
- Gosh. - I'm not 1 of the 6 people?

1467
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,805
How did Kwang Soo get the last question right?

1468
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,630
- At the first try. - Do we really have no chance?

1469
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:00,645
- I shouldn't have trusted you guys. - Sir.

1470
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,730
- Do we have no chance? - I'll let you...

1471
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,400
draw a Chance Card.

1472
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:06,130
- Okay. - There will be more Chance Cards.

1473
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,370
- There will be more? Okay. - Okay.

1474
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:09,455
I'll let either Seok Jin or So Min draw one.

1475
00:55:09,709 --> 00:55:11,585
- Should I do it? - You do it.

1476
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:13,680
(To win a Chance Card...)

1477
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,595
She's going under the table.

1478
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:19,750
So Min, please.

1479
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:21,780
- I really want to eat. - Two are duds.

1480
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:24,390
There's 1 Everybody Eats, and 1...

1481
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:25,620
What's the last one?

1482
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,320
You get to eat.

1483
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,690
- This one? - Yes.

1484
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:31,290
(As long as she doesn't pick a dud, they can taste the food.)

1485
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:32,875
Okay. Do it.

1486
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,635
- I really want to eat. - Two are duds.

1487
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:38,238
There's 1 Everybody Eats, and 1...

1488
00:55:38,238 --> 00:55:39,472
What's the last one?

1489
00:55:39,472 --> 00:55:41,174
You get to eat.

1490
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:42,542
- This one? - Yes.

1491
00:55:42,542 --> 00:55:45,145
(As long as she doesn't pick a dud, they can taste the food.)

1492
00:55:45,145 --> 00:55:46,713
Okay. Do it.

1493
00:55:48,114 --> 00:55:49,683
Okay. Do it.

1494
00:55:50,617 --> 00:55:53,053
If it's a dud, I'll jump out the window.

1495
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:55,288
- This is good. - It's a dud.

1496
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:57,857
Why? Is it a dud?

1497
00:55:57,857 --> 00:55:59,192
(Why?)

1498
00:55:59,192 --> 00:56:00,527
(Is it a dud?)

1499
00:56:00,527 --> 00:56:02,896
- Hey, come on. - Goodness.

1500
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:05,699
What did you just do? I'll pick one.

1501
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:08,635
I'll show you the rest. This one was a dud,

1502
00:56:09,736 --> 00:56:11,972
- Two Bites, - What's going on?

1503
00:56:11,972 --> 00:56:13,206
and Everybody Eats.

1504
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:15,275
See? You should have picked that.

1505
00:56:15,275 --> 00:56:17,611
I've been with these people a lot.

1506
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,979
They'll somehow pick a dud.

1507
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:20,647
(Teasing)

1508
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:22,415
- Why? - They just can't do it.

1509
00:56:22,415 --> 00:56:24,951
It's my first time trying this. It's really good.

1510
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:26,786
- It's good. - This is so good.

1511
00:56:26,786 --> 00:56:28,888
- Just one of us. - This is too bad.

1512
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:31,591
I ate so much earlier. I'm full, so I can't eat too much.

1513
00:56:31,591 --> 00:56:33,793
- Gosh, this punk. - What do you mean?

1514
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:35,362
You're so annoying.

1515
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:37,697
- Hey. - Fine, you can curse.

1516
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:39,799
- Go ahead. - Hey, think about it.

1517
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:43,003
I'm the one who prepared this meal.

1518
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:45,705
"I'm the one who prepared this meal."

1519
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:48,174
I'm so upset.

1520
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:51,578
I'm the one who prepared this meal.

1521
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,280
Does it make sense that I can't eat at all?

1522
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,682
We can't do anything about that.

1523
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:57,584
We all had to solve quizzes to eat.

1524
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,319
It was a difficult process for us too.

1525
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:03,189
(Only 6 members got to eat. Now, they're going for sturgeon sashimi.)

1526
00:57:03,723 --> 00:57:06,092
I have no meal badge.

1527
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,594
Who doesn't have any badges?

1528
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:08,595
You two.

1529
00:57:08,595 --> 00:57:10,397
(Seok Jin and So Min)

1530
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:11,731
- It's just us two? - Yes.

1531
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:12,899
(I shouldn't have asked.)

1532
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,101
- Haha and I have two badges. - Fine.

1533
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:17,003
- Okay. - Am I being bullied?

1534
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:20,273
Fine, I get it. I'll pay back what I suffered.

1535
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:24,344
Sir, you don't have too much time for a payback.

1536
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:26,746
We just need to go to two places, and we're done.

1537
00:57:26,746 --> 00:57:27,781
Yes, that's right.

1538
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:31,418
- We're all full right now. - That's right.

1539
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:33,319
- Did you say, "we're all full"? - To be honest...

1540
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,055
(What?)

1541
00:57:35,055 --> 00:57:37,557
Hey, I'm so hungry right now.

1542
00:57:37,557 --> 00:57:39,592
- We didn't eat. - She and I...

1543
00:57:39,592 --> 00:57:42,095
You two can get hit with the water bomb.

1544
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:44,364
- In general. - I agree.

1545
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:45,398
Fine.

1546
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:46,599
(He's going to be drinking a lot of water.)

1547
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,234
Do you want to play a game?

1548
00:57:48,234 --> 00:57:49,869
- That was fun. - Which one?

1549
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,271
Do you want to play 3, 6, 9?

1550
00:57:51,271 --> 00:57:52,739
- Okay. - All right.

1551
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:54,474
This is how we're choosing a representative.

1552
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,109
If you become a representative again,

1553
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:58,611
- you can pick new people. - Okay.

1554
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:01,681
Let's start with Seok Jin and end with Jae Seok.

1555
00:58:01,681 --> 00:58:03,450
- Like this? - Let's start.

1556
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,952
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

1557
00:58:05,952 --> 00:58:06,986
- 1. - 1.

1558
00:58:06,986 --> 00:58:09,389
(Clapping)

1559
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:11,558
- You're out. - One.

1560
00:58:11,558 --> 00:58:14,094
(She was supposed to say, "two".)

1561
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:16,229
- That was predicted. - Okay.

1562
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:18,698
- You're the first one to go. - It's Ji Hyo.

1563
00:58:18,698 --> 00:58:20,800
- That never happened. - She's out.

1564
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,635
- Ji Hyo. - She has the minus touch.

1565
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:25,305
- That wasn't totally unexpected. - Right.

1566
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:28,408
It's too bad. Actually, let me take that back.

1567
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:31,311
- Give me another chance. - We can't.

1568
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:32,879
I just taught it to her.

1569
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:34,013
- Let's get started again. - Start.

1570
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:36,282
- 3, 6, 9 - 3, 6, 9

1571
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:37,584
- 1. - 1.

1572
00:58:37,584 --> 00:58:40,253
(Clap?)

1573
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:41,988
- Don't do it. - Fine.

1574
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:43,523
- I wanted to join. - What's wrong with you?

1575
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,859
- You weren't supposed to clap. - I wanted to join.

1576
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:47,160
It was "two".

1577
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,995
- Fine. - Why did you clap?

1578
00:58:48,995 --> 00:58:50,363
This is the order, right?

1579
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:51,397
- 5. - 5.

1580
00:58:51,397 --> 00:58:52,799
(After Ji Hyo stops playing, they continue.)

1581
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,701
Seven.

1582
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,569
(He takes a while.)

1583
00:58:56,569 --> 00:58:59,305
- Seven. - Jong Kook.

1584
00:58:59,305 --> 00:59:01,708
- No. - I got confused because of her.

1585
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:04,310
She confused me. I forgot she's not playing.

1586
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:05,445
- 15. - 15.

1587
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:06,646
15.

1588
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,281
One.

1589
00:59:08,281 --> 00:59:09,582
(It's 16.)

1590
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:11,284
He's so confident.

1591
00:59:11,284 --> 00:59:12,886
It's hard after 10.

1592
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:15,421
- Hold on. - Kwang Soo is the winner.

1593
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,891
(After many rounds, Kwang Soo becomes the representative.)

1594
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,193
Kwang Soo is going to want to save himself...

1595
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:22,796
and see the rest of us get wet.

1596
00:59:22,796 --> 00:59:25,331
- I know it's true... - He'll choose three people.

1597
00:59:25,331 --> 00:59:27,200
- I agree. - If you pick three people...

1598
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,336
and you don't get a badge,

1599
00:59:30,336 --> 00:59:32,972
you'll get wet if you're not in first place.

1600
00:59:32,972 --> 00:59:35,542
- That's right. - You'll get people's criticism too.

1601
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:36,609
(You'll get both.)

1602
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:39,612
- No, I'll hit him. - Right. He'll hit you.

1603
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:41,414
(Look at these people.)

1604
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:43,716
- If it's water and criticism... - Be quiet.

1605
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:46,719
(Look at these people.)

1606
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:49,289
Let's focus now.

1607
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:51,090
- Should we think silently? - I like that idea.

1608
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,626
- If it's going to be this way... - Be quiet.

1609
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:54,994
Quiet.

1610
00:59:55,361 --> 00:59:56,596
I pick three people.

1611
00:59:56,596 --> 00:59:58,198
You can pick when we get off.

1612
00:59:58,198 --> 01:00:00,867
- Calm down. - They have sturgeons here.

1613
01:00:00,867 --> 01:00:01,868
- Look. - This is it?

1614
01:00:01,868 --> 01:00:03,603
- Is this a farm? - Yes, they have them here.

1615
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:05,104
- That's right. - Be careful.

1616
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:06,639
- This is a farm. - These are sturgeons.

1617
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:07,841
There they are.

1618
01:00:08,308 --> 01:00:09,876
It's a sturgeon!

1619
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:12,779
- Where? It's a sturgeon. - It's a sturgeon.

1620
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:15,281
Didn't Seok Jin say that they're small?

1621
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:18,985
- They're huge. - Some of them are big.

1622
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:21,421
- They're big. - How do we catch them? Look.

1623
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:22,722
They're huge.

1624
01:00:22,856 --> 01:00:26,459
He'll show you how to catch it.

1625
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:29,195
- Really? - Hello.

1626
01:00:29,362 --> 01:00:31,331
- You catch it by yourself? - Yes.

1627
01:00:31,331 --> 01:00:33,800
(He uses a basic net.)

1628
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,536
- Sir. - Do you make sashimi right away?

1629
01:00:36,736 --> 01:00:38,705
He catches a big one?

1630
01:00:38,705 --> 01:00:39,973
(He enters the farm with just a net.)

1631
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:43,376
- It's too big, sir. - You're right. It's really big.

1632
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:44,644
(He moves the net carefully.)

1633
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:45,645
Is he going under it?

1634
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,881
(He moves the net carefully.)

1635
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:50,717
(He successfully catches the sturgeon.)

1636
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:55,088
(Look at how strong it is.)

1637
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,456
It's so big.

1638
01:00:56,456 --> 01:00:57,457
(How many members will get to eat?)

1639
01:00:57,457 --> 01:00:59,292
It's really strong.

1640
01:01:00,393 --> 01:01:02,095
Let me be realistic.

1641
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:03,463
(He has to pick 3 or 6 people.)

1642
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:05,899
There's plenty of chance to get first place.

1643
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,300
(Kwang Soo gets to see it first.)

1644
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,802
This is how it looks like. There's caviar too.

1645
01:01:10,236 --> 01:01:13,907
(There's sturgeon sashimi, liver, skin, and caviar.)

1646
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:17,644
The third menu is sturgeon sashimi.

1647
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,480
Between three people, including yourself, eating...

1648
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,984
or six random people eating, which do you choose?

1649
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:27,587
- Can it be just one person? - No.

1650
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:29,789
For your information, looking at the remaining time,

1651
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:32,725
if you pick three people, you'll lose the mission.

1652
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:33,893
(There is 1.5 hours left.)

1653
01:01:33,893 --> 01:01:35,595
(If he picks 3 people, he gets to eat and get a badge.)

1654
01:01:35,595 --> 01:01:37,230
If I pick three people, I'll lose?

1655
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,300
Based on the remaining time, that's likely.

1656
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,502
(If he picks 3 people, he gets to eat and get a badge.)

1657
01:01:42,502 --> 01:01:45,538
- I'll have two badges, right? - Yes.

1658
01:01:46,439 --> 01:01:50,543
(Why do I have to face this ordeal?)

1659
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:54,314
(Let me think rationally.)

1660
01:01:55,581 --> 01:01:57,984
(He peeks at the sashimi.)

1661
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,219
(Kwang Soo is in deep thought. What is his decision?)

1662
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:02,355
(Quivering)

1663
01:02:02,355 --> 01:02:05,758
I think he picked six random people. I'm slightly hopeful.

1664
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,794
Kwang Soo, is it three people?

1665
01:02:07,794 --> 01:02:09,796
I think he picked six people.

1666
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:11,731
I think so too.

1667
01:02:11,731 --> 01:02:13,967
He won't. He won't pick six people.

1668
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:17,003
Between picking three people including himself...

1669
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:18,871
or six random people...

1670
01:02:18,871 --> 01:02:21,007
- If he picked three people... - That would be a surprise.

1671
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:22,642
That means he doesn't think.

1672
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:24,544
That's like a treason.

1673
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:26,279
That's right. That's betraying the whole team.

1674
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:28,481
- That means the day is over. - He picked three people.

1675
01:02:28,481 --> 01:02:29,482
Kwang Soo...

1676
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:32,251
(What did Kwang Soo choose?)

1677
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:33,453
Kwang Soo picked six random people.

1678
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:36,789
(That was unexpected.)

1679
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:37,790
- Really? - Why?

1680
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,993
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1681
01:02:39,993 --> 01:02:41,561
- Why did you do that? - I...

1682
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,998
If I had none, I would have picked three people right away.

1683
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:45,999
But I have this.

1684
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:47,500
(He thought it'd be beneficial for him to win the mission.)

1685
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,769
- I pick six people. - Okay.

1686
01:02:49,902 --> 01:02:53,539
I mentioned this earlier, but he won't ruin it for us.

1687
01:02:53,539 --> 01:02:57,610
This mission will decide which six people get to eat.

1688
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:00,079
- It's the Apartment Game. - "Apartment"?

1689
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,247
(Apartment Game)

1690
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:02,415
- What is it? - This?

1691
01:03:02,415 --> 01:03:04,917
(Do you stack something?)

1692
01:03:05,051 --> 01:03:07,854
You'll be in teams of four people, and each team will take turns.

1693
01:03:07,854 --> 01:03:11,624
I'll say a random number, and you have to stack your fists.

1694
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:13,893
The bottom hand goes to the top, and you stack them...

1695
01:03:13,893 --> 01:03:15,228
starting from one.

1696
01:03:15,228 --> 01:03:17,697
If your turn lands on the number I called, you're out.

1697
01:03:17,697 --> 01:03:19,098
Okay. You're out?

1698
01:03:19,098 --> 01:03:20,199
(If your turn is the number that's called, you're out.)

1699
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:23,102
- This is all luck. - However,

1700
01:03:23,102 --> 01:03:25,905
you're not just stacking. You'll slap the hand that's on top.

1701
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:28,007
(You have to slap the hand on top and place your hand above it.)

1702
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:31,010
If you can't withstand the pain and make noise,

1703
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,645
- you're out. - We can't make noise?

1704
01:03:32,645 --> 01:03:33,713
(They didn't know about this one.)

1705
01:03:33,713 --> 01:03:36,949
Where Jong Kook's hand is...

1706
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:38,885
We're on this side.

1707
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:40,286
- No. - I picked the wrong seat.

1708
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:43,222
- No, we have to choose teams. - We get to pick.

1709
01:03:43,222 --> 01:03:46,225
I don't want to be on Jong Kook's or Kwang Soo's team.

1710
01:03:46,225 --> 01:03:48,227
Kwang Soo has big hands.

1711
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:50,630
We have to avoid Jong Kook and Kwang Soo.

1712
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:52,098
Haha first.

1713
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:53,433
(There are 4 yellow spoons, and 4 red spoons.)

1714
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:56,002
- It's yellow. - He's weak.

1715
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,303
- It's yellow. - She's weak.

1716
01:03:57,303 --> 01:03:59,439
I have to be on that team.

1717
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:00,506
Yellow.

1718
01:04:00,506 --> 01:04:02,308
(So Min picks yellow as well.)

1719
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:04,343
- What? Yes. - What?

1720
01:04:04,343 --> 01:04:06,512
- If he's yellow, it's over. - As long as it's not Jong Kook.

1721
01:04:06,512 --> 01:04:07,513
(Team Yellow has the weak people. There's only 1 space left.)

1722
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:10,416
(I want to be on this team too.)

1723
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,051
It's red.

1724
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:14,487
(Kwang Soo picks Team Red.)

1725
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:16,055
(That was expected.)

1726
01:04:16,222 --> 01:04:17,557
Obviously.

1727
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,192
(Everybody wants to be on Team Yellow.)

1728
01:04:19,192 --> 01:04:20,193
This...

1729
01:04:20,193 --> 01:04:21,627
(What did Jae Seok pick?)

1730
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:23,629
Gosh.

1731
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:25,898
(Jae Seok is also on Team Red.)

1732
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:27,467
Okay. It's my turn.

1733
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:29,902
(Let me take that last spot in Team Yellow.)

1734
01:04:29,969 --> 01:04:32,371
(Team Red is already dirty.)

1735
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:35,875
(Team Yellow is the weak team with one space left.)

1736
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,610
(Where will Se Chan go?)

1737
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,512
(Goodness)

1738
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,714
(Se Chan is also on Team Red.)

1739
01:04:41,714 --> 01:04:43,249
This is the best.

1740
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:44,517
(The weakest and the strongest are left.)

1741
01:04:44,517 --> 01:04:46,586
Please.

1742
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:52,225
- Seok Jin! - Seok Jin!

1743
01:04:52,425 --> 01:04:54,560
- At the same time? - 1, 2, 3.

1744
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:56,729
(There's 1 space left in each team.)

1745
01:04:56,729 --> 01:04:58,498
- Please. - Please.

1746
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:04,403
(This is the only time Seok Jin is popular. Which team is lucky?)

1747
01:05:04,637 --> 01:05:09,008
(Team Red gets Seok Jin.)

1748
01:05:09,308 --> 01:05:12,445
(Yes, we have him.)

1749
01:05:12,445 --> 01:05:15,581
(Team Red is so happy.)

1750
01:05:15,648 --> 01:05:16,716
What? Do we get Jong Kook?

1751
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:18,384
(There's a predator...)

1752
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:20,887
(amongst the weak ones.)

1753
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:23,456
- This is good. - That was no joke.

1754
01:05:23,456 --> 01:05:24,657
(The teams have been decided.)

1755
01:05:24,657 --> 01:05:26,959
I should have gone to the other team.

1756
01:05:26,959 --> 01:05:28,561
- That was nerve-wrecking. - We're good.

1757
01:05:29,128 --> 01:05:31,864
I'm going to endure the pain.

1758
01:05:31,864 --> 01:05:34,300
- Let me apologize ahead of time. - I'll clench my teeth and endure.

1759
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,202
If you make any kind of noise, you're out, right?

1760
01:05:36,202 --> 01:05:39,105
If you make any kind of noise, you are...

1761
01:05:39,105 --> 01:05:41,407
- 1 of 2 people who can't eat. - That's right.

1762
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:42,708
One person is out.

1763
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,544
- They can't eat. - Yes, they're out.

1764
01:05:44,544 --> 01:05:45,611
Start.

1765
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:48,481
- Apartment - Apartment

1766
01:05:48,481 --> 01:05:51,217
I'm crossing the bridge on a starry night

1767
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:53,986
(They sing until the director calls out a number.)

1768
01:05:53,986 --> 01:05:56,656
(Let's eat some sturgeon sashimi.)

1769
01:05:56,656 --> 01:05:59,458
And passing by a windy reed field

1770
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:03,396
(They have to stack both hands.)

1771
01:06:03,396 --> 01:06:08,534
(My sturgeon sashimi)

1772
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:09,802
15 floors.

1773
01:06:09,802 --> 01:06:11,704
- Okay, this is good. - This is good.

1774
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:13,539
You can bring your hand to the top and say, "First floor".

1775
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:15,208
(Kwang Soo is on the bottom, and Seok Jin is on top.)

1776
01:06:15,241 --> 01:06:21,514
(Kwang Soo slaps Seok Jin's hand, and Seok Jin can't make any noises.)

1777
01:06:22,582 --> 01:06:25,551
(Kwang Soo jumps and slaps.)

1778
01:06:25,551 --> 01:06:27,587
That wasn't as bad as I thought.

1779
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:29,655
(What?)

1780
01:06:29,655 --> 01:06:30,856
You made a sound.

1781
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:33,192
(That means you're out.)

1782
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:34,760
You made a sound.

1783
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:37,029
No.

1784
01:06:37,964 --> 01:06:39,065
He's out.

1785
01:06:39,065 --> 01:06:41,534
(He didn't understand the rules. He was loud, and he's out.)

1786
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:42,702
He didn't understand the game.

1787
01:06:42,702 --> 01:06:44,937
(Isn't it okay as long as it didn't hurt?)

1788
01:06:44,937 --> 01:06:46,305
(You're not supposed to make any noise.)

1789
01:06:46,305 --> 01:06:47,807
No way.

1790
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:50,376
(Nice, Seok Jin.)

1791
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:51,844
Did you see that?

1792
01:06:51,844 --> 01:06:53,279
"That wasn't as bad as I thought."

1793
01:06:54,213 --> 01:06:56,082
(Seok Jin can't eat.)

1794
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:58,050
That was unbelievable.

1795
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,986
(Seok Jin gets to keep starving. Who will join him from Team Yellow?)

1796
01:06:59,986 --> 01:07:01,487
1, 2, 3, 4.

1797
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:02,922
- Apartment - Apartment

1798
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:04,390
(Team Yellow starts.)

1799
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:09,895
(The person who gets eliminated doesn't get to eat the sashimi.)

1800
01:07:10,263 --> 01:07:12,932
(They have their arms around each other and sing.)

1801
01:07:12,932 --> 01:07:15,668
(So Min is so weak.)

1802
01:07:15,668 --> 01:07:17,236
So Min doesn't want to do it.

1803
01:07:17,737 --> 01:07:19,805
She doesn't want to do it.

1804
01:07:19,805 --> 01:07:22,241
(She didn't eat at all. She doesn't want to do it.)

1805
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:25,311
(When the director calls out a number, they have to stack.)

1806
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,980
(Creaking)

1807
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:30,016
- 13 floors. - 13 floors.

1808
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:31,851
Why do you look so unenthusiastic?

1809
01:07:31,851 --> 01:07:33,786
- It's so obvious. - Stop pretending.

1810
01:07:33,786 --> 01:07:36,856
- I'm sorry. I stacked wrong. - 13 floors?

1811
01:07:37,023 --> 01:07:38,424
I stacked my hands wrong.

1812
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:40,059
I'm dead.

1813
01:07:40,059 --> 01:07:42,028
(Haha gets to slap So Min's hands.)

1814
01:07:42,028 --> 01:07:43,129
First floor.

1815
01:07:43,129 --> 01:07:45,197
(He slaps with full power.)

1816
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:46,432
She didn't make noise.

1817
01:07:46,432 --> 01:07:47,967
You shouldn't say the floor numbers.

1818
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,568
Do we have to...

1819
01:07:49,735 --> 01:07:51,971
- call out the floor? - It doesn't matter.

1820
01:07:52,104 --> 01:07:53,406
The one getting hit can't make a noise.

1821
01:07:53,773 --> 01:07:54,840
Two?

1822
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:00,079
(It's Jong Kook's turn against the coward, Haha.)

1823
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:02,048
He's using his right hand.

1824
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:05,217
(If Haha makes any noise, he doesn't get to eat.)

1825
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:10,289
(Why did So Min make noise?)

1826
01:08:10,289 --> 01:08:11,557
What?

1827
01:08:11,557 --> 01:08:12,858
(Haha didn't say anything, but So Min started crying.)

1828
01:08:12,858 --> 01:08:14,927
- She made noise. - So Min is out.

1829
01:08:14,927 --> 01:08:17,229
It wasn't your turn.

1830
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:18,731
- It wasn't your turn, right? - Already?

1831
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:21,233
Why you? What's wrong?

1832
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:24,203
I got slapped.

1833
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:26,972
- My hand hurts too. - Why?

1834
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,909
I didn't get slapped directly, but it hurts.

1835
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:31,577
That was so useless.

1836
01:08:31,577 --> 01:08:33,646
(So Min and Seok Jin can't eat.)

1837
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:36,349
I've never had sturgeon sashimi before.

1838
01:08:36,515 --> 01:08:38,751
There's soup too.

1839
01:08:38,818 --> 01:08:40,686
You can have it as shabu shabu.

1840
01:08:40,686 --> 01:08:42,722
There's caviar.

1841
01:08:43,422 --> 01:08:44,890
This is good.

1842
01:08:45,157 --> 01:08:46,292
Can I have the sauce?

1843
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,027
(Seok Jin won the bonus game, and he gets to eat.)

1844
01:08:48,027 --> 01:08:50,363
This is really good as shabu shabu.

1845
01:08:50,830 --> 01:08:54,100
(This is the best.)

1846
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,434
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1847
01:08:55,468 --> 01:08:57,370
Let me see. Let me see your hand.

1848
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:58,537
Let me try the shabu shabu.

1849
01:08:58,537 --> 01:08:59,538
I will make shabu shabu.

1850
01:08:59,538 --> 01:09:02,441
(Let me parboil your hand.)

1851
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,743
What are you doing?

1852
01:09:03,843 --> 01:09:05,111
What do you think you're doing?

1853
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,146
So Min must be hungry.

1854
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:08,381
(She didn't get to eat at all.)

1855
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:09,882
So Min, I can't give you a badge,

1856
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:11,650
but I'll give you a chance to eat the sashimi.

1857
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:13,018
Can't you give me a badge?

1858
01:09:13,018 --> 01:09:14,353
I can't.

1859
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,155
I can let you eat.

1860
01:09:16,188 --> 01:09:18,224
I do want to give her a chance.

1861
01:09:18,224 --> 01:09:19,425
Okay.

1862
01:09:19,658 --> 01:09:21,827
Can I have a bite?

1863
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:24,797
Can you make an acrostic poem with "sturgeon sashimi"?

1864
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,532
- Sturgeon sashimi? That's hard. - If the staff members...

1865
01:09:26,532 --> 01:09:28,334
laugh, you win.

1866
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:29,468
That's so hard.

1867
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:31,871
- Sturgeon sashimi. - So Min.

1868
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:34,106
- Do a cute version like Twice. - That's right.

1869
01:09:34,106 --> 01:09:35,408
(Do you remember?)

1870
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:41,447
(Twice's cute acrostic poems were a big hit a month ago.)

1871
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:43,749
(This is how you act cute.)

1872
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:48,154
(The staff fell for them too.)

1873
01:09:48,154 --> 01:09:50,623
- Do the cute version. - They'll laugh.

1874
01:09:51,056 --> 01:09:52,158
Our staff...

1875
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,428
- "S". Start over. - "S".

1876
01:09:55,661 --> 01:09:57,196
So Min loves you.

1877
01:09:57,196 --> 01:10:00,199
(So Min loves you.)

1878
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:03,636
(They're not laughing yet.)

1879
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:04,937
- "G". - "G".

1880
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:07,173
Gosh.

1881
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:10,476
(She tries to act cute.)

1882
01:10:10,876 --> 01:10:11,977
Nobody is laughing.

1883
01:10:11,977 --> 01:10:13,212
(There's no expression on his face.)

1884
01:10:13,212 --> 01:10:14,580
I'm speechless.

1885
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,948
(They're not laughing at all.)

1886
01:10:15,948 --> 01:10:17,149
"S".

1887
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:18,651
Start smiling!

1888
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:22,655
(That wasn't good.)

1889
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:26,158
How can I make you laugh when you're trying not to?

1890
01:10:26,192 --> 01:10:27,293
It worked because it was Twice.

1891
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:28,994
They were trying to be open-minded.

1892
01:10:29,128 --> 01:10:30,262
First of all...

1893
01:10:30,262 --> 01:10:31,897
(If you're going to be this way,)

1894
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:34,200
(how's this?)

1895
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,502
They are pretty.

1896
01:10:36,502 --> 01:10:38,304
(She tries to make them laugh with a cute dance.)

1897
01:10:38,304 --> 01:10:40,806
(She's doing that again.)

1898
01:10:40,806 --> 01:10:43,409
(He is ignoring her.)

1899
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:44,610
Don't I look like Twice?

1900
01:10:44,777 --> 01:10:47,613
(She tries her best.)

1901
01:10:47,613 --> 01:10:48,948
They're heartless.

1902
01:10:48,948 --> 01:10:50,549
(The members don't laugh either.)

1903
01:10:50,549 --> 01:10:52,218
When Twice was here,

1904
01:10:52,218 --> 01:10:54,220
they were drooling while watching Twice.

1905
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,754
(They were drooling while watching Twice.)

1906
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:58,491
(They were all smiles.)

1907
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:01,060
You're too strict towards So Min. You're too cold.

1908
01:11:02,428 --> 01:11:04,129
- That's tough. - They're so cold.

1909
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,764
So Min.

1910
01:11:05,764 --> 01:11:09,068
(Poor So Min.)

1911
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:13,305
(Will Jae Seok give her a bite?)

1912
01:11:13,305 --> 01:11:14,306
Eat the next one.

1913
01:11:14,306 --> 01:11:15,841
(Give up on this one.)

1914
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:17,543
- There's another chance. - He was...

1915
01:11:17,543 --> 01:11:19,812
so mean. You were eating too.

1916
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:21,146
Eat the next one.

1917
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,581
That's a way.

1918
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:24,984
Where are we going to next?

1919
01:11:25,084 --> 01:11:26,685
You can pick.

1920
01:11:26,685 --> 01:11:28,988
We're here right now.

1921
01:11:28,988 --> 01:11:30,256
(It's time to pick the next restaurant.)

1922
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:32,191
- Should we go this way? - Go down.

1923
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:34,693
(There's eel or nine-seafood stew.)

1924
01:11:34,693 --> 01:11:37,196
- We have to try nine-seafood stew. - It sounds interesting.

1925
01:11:37,196 --> 01:11:39,598
I've never had it before. Nine-seafood stew.

1926
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:41,300
All right. That's the next menu.

1927
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,403
(Nine-seafood stew is the next menu.)

1928
01:11:44,403 --> 01:11:47,873
Let's pick the next representative with the spoons.

1929
01:11:47,873 --> 01:11:51,610
(Ji Hyo, So Min, Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok are left.)

1930
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:58,484
(The person who picks a red spoon is the representative.)

1931
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:00,953
- I saw the yellow. - Me too.

1932
01:12:00,953 --> 01:12:02,187
(I saw So Min's yellow spoon.)

1933
01:12:02,187 --> 01:12:03,489
Why didn't you say anything?

1934
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:04,990
I couldn't say anything.

1935
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:07,259
So Min, your spoon is yellow.

1936
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:09,895
(She tries to switch.)

1937
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:12,565
- Goodness. - You were hiding it, but we saw it.

1938
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:15,167
(I hope I picked red this time.)

1939
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:16,435
- Ji Hyo first. - Ji Hyo first.

1940
01:12:16,435 --> 01:12:17,836
- Do I go first? - Yes.

1941
01:12:18,637 --> 01:12:22,274
(She picks a red spoon.)

1942
01:12:23,008 --> 01:12:24,343
(How typical.)

1943
01:12:24,343 --> 01:12:26,045
- You saw it. - I'll take them back.

1944
01:12:26,412 --> 01:12:27,880
Ji Hyo, let's go for six people.

1945
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,715
I knew it would be her. She's good.

1946
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:32,384
There was no point in changing it.

1947
01:12:32,685 --> 01:12:35,154
Nine-seafood stew is the last item.

1948
01:12:35,154 --> 01:12:37,289
- I really want to try it. - It's today's highlight.

1949
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:38,657
This is the main item.

1950
01:12:38,657 --> 01:12:39,925
Will I...

1951
01:12:39,925 --> 01:12:41,760
get to eat it or surrender?

1952
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,563
(She tries to joke.)

1953
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,199
It's raining today.

1954
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:50,569
- It'll be cold. - If you get wet, it will be.

1955
01:12:50,636 --> 01:12:53,439
If there are two people in last place,

1956
01:12:53,472 --> 01:12:55,374
they'll compete to pick one loser.

1957
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:58,410
(There'll be a match to pick one loser.)

1958
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:00,980
So Min has a chance then.

1959
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,016
What if the loser picks one person to take the penalty with?

1960
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:05,584
All of a sudden?

1961
01:13:05,684 --> 01:13:06,852
I don't like that idea.

1962
01:13:06,852 --> 01:13:08,487
Everything is a competition.

1963
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:10,656
- Do you have none? - I have none.

1964
01:13:10,656 --> 01:13:11,757
I'm the only one without a badge.

1965
01:13:11,757 --> 01:13:13,459
- And you didn't eat at all? - No.

1966
01:13:13,592 --> 01:13:15,160
It's rare for either Kwang Soo or I to...

1967
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,162
- get penalties two weeks in a row. - That's right.

1968
01:13:17,429 --> 01:13:18,631
It doesn't happen.

1969
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:20,666
- She's incredible. - She is.

1970
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,134
She's a legend.

1971
01:13:22,735 --> 01:13:24,570
I'm so depressed. It's raining too.

1972
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:26,071
(What is wrong with me?)

1973
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:31,043
It's raining

1974
01:13:31,043 --> 01:13:33,112
- So I thought of you - So I thought of you

1975
01:13:33,112 --> 01:13:35,047
It's raining

1976
01:13:35,514 --> 01:13:37,616
- And the music plays - When were you born?

1977
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:41,253
- I think of - There are many songs about rain.

1978
01:13:41,253 --> 01:13:43,789
I think of you

1979
01:13:43,789 --> 01:13:44,923
(She expresses her depressed feelings with songs.)

1980
01:13:44,923 --> 01:13:46,525
Old songs have good lyrics.

1981
01:13:46,558 --> 01:13:48,794
- "Letter" is good too. - Right, "Letter".

1982
01:13:48,827 --> 01:13:50,896
- Is this - Is this

1983
01:13:50,896 --> 01:13:52,064
We're in harmony.

1984
01:13:52,064 --> 01:13:53,399
- The end - The end

1985
01:13:53,399 --> 01:13:55,534
- Is that harmony? - Really?

1986
01:13:55,534 --> 01:13:58,804
You just can't sing, so you're singing in different keys.

1987
01:13:58,804 --> 01:14:00,806
- We weren't totally off. - No, we were not.

1988
01:14:00,806 --> 01:14:02,541
- That worked a little bit. - Who's singing the melody?

1989
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,176
- I'll do it. - You will?

1990
01:14:04,176 --> 01:14:07,379
Sing in harmony. 1, 2, start.

1991
01:14:07,379 --> 01:14:10,149
(So Min is the main vocalist.)

1992
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:12,584
(Let's sing in harmony.)

1993
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:16,622
- Is this - Is this

1994
01:14:16,622 --> 01:14:19,091
(It's terrifying.)

1995
01:14:19,558 --> 01:14:22,461
(It's a frightening harmony.)

1996
01:14:22,461 --> 01:14:24,063
- You're pretty good. - Right?

1997
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:25,197
- He's pretty good. - Right.

1998
01:14:25,197 --> 01:14:26,732
- He's not sloppy. - No.

1999
01:14:26,732 --> 01:14:28,333
I'm solid.

2000
01:14:28,333 --> 01:14:30,502
- You're solid. - I'm good, right?

2001
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:35,841
(They sing a cappella this time.)

2002
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,277
(I'd rather not watch.)

2003
01:14:38,977 --> 01:14:42,514
(Beatboxing)

2004
01:14:42,514 --> 01:14:43,949
This isn't bad.

2005
01:14:45,751 --> 01:14:47,252
When the night

2006
01:14:47,986 --> 01:14:49,388
Has come

2007
01:14:49,788 --> 01:14:53,525
His voice...

2008
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:56,395
sounds like Cherry Boy's.

2009
01:14:56,395 --> 01:14:57,763
(He's an old singer.)

2010
01:14:57,996 --> 01:14:59,565
(Cherry Boy?)

2011
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:00,632
That's so funny.

2012
01:15:00,632 --> 01:15:02,000
Jeery Boy.

2013
01:15:02,868 --> 01:15:04,570
- "Jeery Boy". - Jeery Boy.

2014
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:05,938
(Seok Jin is Jeery Boy.)

2015
01:15:05,938 --> 01:15:07,873
(Jeery Boy?)

2016
01:15:07,873 --> 01:15:09,141
Nice one.

2017
01:15:10,743 --> 01:15:12,211
My songs are not hot.

2018
01:15:12,211 --> 01:15:13,645
- I'm Jeery Boy. - Jeery Boy.

2019
01:15:13,746 --> 01:15:16,348
It's a bit bland.

2020
01:15:16,615 --> 01:15:19,685
It's clear.

2021
01:15:19,685 --> 01:15:20,853
It's Jeery.

2022
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:21,987
- Jeery Boy. - It's clear soup.

2023
01:15:21,987 --> 01:15:23,722
We're missing a word in front.

2024
01:15:24,123 --> 01:15:25,390
Pee Jeery Boy.

2025
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,692
("Pee" is the missing word.)

2026
01:15:26,692 --> 01:15:29,194
(Pee Jeery Boy?)

2027
01:15:29,194 --> 01:15:30,729
Jeery Boy.

2028
01:15:31,396 --> 01:15:32,431
(He becomes a dirty boy.)

2029
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:33,599
- Pee Jeery Boy. - Pee Jeery Boy.

2030
01:15:33,599 --> 01:15:35,367
Remove the first word.

2031
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:36,468
Jeery Boy is better.

2032
01:15:36,468 --> 01:15:37,970
It's like a stage name.

2033
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:39,471
That was hilarious.

2034
01:15:39,471 --> 01:15:43,809
(After the Jeery Boy fiasco)

2035
01:15:47,946 --> 01:15:49,648
- I think we are here. - I know.

2036
01:15:50,282 --> 01:15:52,584
(He doesn't wake up.)

2037
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:55,621
(He is sleeping.)

2038
01:15:56,622 --> 01:15:58,090
He is sleeping.

2039
01:15:58,090 --> 01:16:00,592
(Shall we pull a prank on him?)

2040
01:16:00,592 --> 01:16:02,561
(Okay, I have an idea.)

2041
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:05,063
(Cheering)

2042
01:16:06,532 --> 01:16:08,000
(He wakes up in a surprised state.)

2043
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,836
- That's amazing. - I can't believe it.

2044
01:16:10,836 --> 01:16:13,572
Will the rule apply from now on?

2045
01:16:13,639 --> 01:16:15,774
You agree with the decision, right?

2046
01:16:15,774 --> 01:16:18,043
- Yes. - It's just unexpected.

2047
01:16:18,043 --> 01:16:20,379
Then a come-from-behind victory will be possible.

2048
01:16:20,379 --> 01:16:22,080
- That's right. - Let's stop talking about it.

2049
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,882
- Okay. - Don't change your mind.

2050
01:16:23,882 --> 01:16:25,918
- Okay. - Don't change the rule.

2051
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:28,754
- We can turn the tables. - It's more than possible.

2052
01:16:28,754 --> 01:16:30,088
Okay, okay.

2053
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:31,523
Okay.

2054
01:16:32,157 --> 01:16:34,126
Seok Jin...

2055
01:16:34,126 --> 01:16:36,228
Is it possible to turn the tables?

2056
01:16:36,228 --> 01:16:42,000
(Slurring)

2057
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,037
(They can't hold in their laughter.)

2058
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:46,672
(Why are they laughing?)

2059
01:16:46,672 --> 01:16:48,006
- What? - Your pronunciation.

2060
01:16:48,006 --> 01:16:50,876
What's wrong with your pronunciation?

2061
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:54,646
Seok Jin, do you even know how to turn the tables?

2062
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,348
Why would you continue on with the shoot without me?

2063
01:16:56,348 --> 01:16:59,318
(Why would you continue on with the shoot without me?)

2064
01:16:59,585 --> 01:17:01,019
Seriously.

2065
01:17:01,019 --> 01:17:02,921
You fell asleep.

2066
01:17:02,921 --> 01:17:04,523
(Tell me how to turn the tables.)

2067
01:17:05,757 --> 01:17:08,627
This is the best.

2068
01:17:09,194 --> 01:17:12,297
(Ji Hyo gets to make the final decision.)

2069
01:17:12,297 --> 01:17:13,365
(This is nine-seafood stew.)

2070
01:17:13,365 --> 01:17:14,967
It smells delicious.

2071
01:17:16,301 --> 01:17:20,372
(The dish contains ingredients from the land, sea, and air.)

2072
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:22,908
(Nine-seafood stew is the epitome of invigorating food...)

2073
01:17:22,908 --> 01:17:26,645
(that contains ogol chicken, octopus, abalone, and more.)

2074
01:17:26,645 --> 01:17:28,780
It looks amazing.

2075
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:31,083
Since this is the last decision,

2076
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:33,952
I will choose six people.

2077
01:17:33,952 --> 01:17:35,254
(She chooses 6 people without hesitation...)

2078
01:17:35,254 --> 01:17:36,722
(to get 20 servings.)

2079
01:17:36,722 --> 01:17:39,992
The mission to determine the six people who get to eat is...

2080
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:41,660
the backwards long jump.

2081
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:44,129
You will stand at the end of the mat and jump backwards.

2082
01:17:44,129 --> 01:17:45,797
The six people who jump the farthest...

2083
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:48,433
will get to eat.

2084
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:50,335
All right.

2085
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:52,004
Okay.

2086
01:17:52,004 --> 01:17:53,839
(Ji Hyo's record isn't very good.)

2087
01:17:55,007 --> 01:17:56,008
What was that?

2088
01:17:56,008 --> 01:17:57,009
(Hopping)

2089
01:17:57,009 --> 01:17:58,143
(Seok Jin places last.)

2090
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,713
Thus, the bottom two are Ji Hyo and Seok Jin.

2091
01:18:01,713 --> 01:18:04,416
(Everyone except for Ji Hyo and Seok Jin get to eat.)

2092
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:05,484
What is that?

2093
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:07,386
(The sight makes their mouths water.)

2094
01:18:07,386 --> 01:18:08,754
Oh, my goodness.

2095
01:18:08,754 --> 01:18:10,022
It's sad that I can't eat it.

2096
01:18:10,022 --> 01:18:12,090
- It's sad that I can't eat it. - I get to eat it.

2097
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,659
- It's invigorating food. - I get to eat it.

2098
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:16,128
- Seok Jin doesn't get to eat it. - I get to eat it.

2099
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:18,630
- Seok Jin doesn't get to eat it. - Jae Seok, let's eat.

2100
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:19,731
Okay.

2101
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:22,834
- Thank you for the food. - I chose six people...

2102
01:18:22,834 --> 01:18:25,103
- for the members. - Thank you so much.

2103
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:26,271
(How does nine-seafood stew taste?)

2104
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:28,707
It contains a whole chicken.

2105
01:18:28,707 --> 01:18:30,709
- A whole chicken. - This is...

2106
01:18:30,709 --> 01:18:32,311
I will eat a drumstick.

2107
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:33,412
(It's tender and chewy.)

2108
01:18:33,412 --> 01:18:34,880
My goodness.

2109
01:18:34,913 --> 01:18:36,548
Look at that conch.

2110
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:40,352
It's invigorating food.

2111
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:42,821
Isn't there...

2112
01:18:42,821 --> 01:18:44,356
- a Chance Card? - A Chance Card.

2113
01:18:44,423 --> 01:18:46,892
Would you please let...

2114
01:18:46,892 --> 01:18:48,226
one of us eat?

2115
01:18:48,226 --> 01:18:50,128
We should give some food to Ji Hyo.

2116
01:18:50,128 --> 01:18:51,596
- Why? - Why?

2117
01:18:51,596 --> 01:18:52,931
- She sacrificed herself for us. - I chose...

2118
01:18:52,931 --> 01:18:54,733
six people so that the members could eat.

2119
01:18:54,733 --> 01:18:56,501
I chose six people earlier as well.

2120
01:18:56,568 --> 01:18:58,470
That was forever ago.

2121
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,573
(That was forever ago.)

2122
01:19:01,573 --> 01:19:03,575
- All right. - That was forever ago.

2123
01:19:03,575 --> 01:19:05,143
He keeps talking about the past.

2124
01:19:05,143 --> 01:19:07,479
Just know that I am waiting to take my revenge.

2125
01:19:07,479 --> 01:19:09,181
I am waiting to take my revenge.

2126
01:19:09,848 --> 01:19:12,718
Will you let them play Pirate Roulette Game...

2127
01:19:12,718 --> 01:19:14,786
for a chance to eat?

2128
01:19:14,786 --> 01:19:15,887
- Sure. - I am for it.

2129
01:19:15,887 --> 01:19:17,189
It's not too much to ask of us.

2130
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:19,024
- If you make the pirate pop up... - Then you don't get to eat.

2131
01:19:19,024 --> 01:19:20,025
(Then you don't get to eat.)

2132
01:19:20,025 --> 01:19:23,895
(Let's see who gets to taste the nine-seafood stew.)

2133
01:19:24,663 --> 01:19:25,697
Okay.

2134
01:19:25,697 --> 01:19:27,132
(Seok Jin's first try is a success.)

2135
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:30,002
(Should I insert it here or there?)

2136
01:19:30,902 --> 01:19:32,537
(She hesitates for a while...)

2137
01:19:32,537 --> 01:19:33,605
(and succeeds to insert a sword.)

2138
01:19:33,605 --> 01:19:36,041
Okay, I will choose the slot you didn't choose.

2139
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:37,376
That's the slot Ji Hyo didn't choose.

2140
01:19:37,376 --> 01:19:39,544
(That's the slot Ji Hyo didn't choose.)

2141
01:19:40,112 --> 01:19:43,048
(Popping up)

2142
01:19:44,483 --> 01:19:45,550
(Seok Jin loses.)

2143
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:46,752
Did it end already?

2144
01:19:47,019 --> 01:19:49,054
- Ji Hyo avoided the slot. - Move.

2145
01:19:49,054 --> 01:19:50,989
- You avoided the slot. - Move.

2146
01:19:51,123 --> 01:19:52,691
- My goodness. - Move.

2147
01:19:54,059 --> 01:19:56,061
Seok Jin is really unlucky.

2148
01:19:56,061 --> 01:19:57,963
I think he will receive the penalty.

2149
01:19:58,497 --> 01:20:00,332
I think so.

2150
01:20:00,332 --> 01:20:02,234
This will be the end of my bad luck.

2151
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:04,336
(This is tasty.)

2152
01:20:05,704 --> 01:20:07,773
May I give you a 3-line poem about 9-seafood stew?

2153
01:20:07,773 --> 01:20:09,141
Go ahead.

2154
01:20:09,808 --> 01:20:11,043
- The 1st line. - The 1st line.

2155
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:13,311
I refuse to beg for food.

2156
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,846
Fine.

2157
01:20:16,248 --> 01:20:17,816
(I refuse to beg for food.)

2158
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:19,751
(Fine.)

2159
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:20,919
Fine.

2160
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:22,554
- You refuse to beg for food. - I am not done yet.

2161
01:20:23,055 --> 01:20:24,122
The second line.

2162
01:20:24,122 --> 01:20:26,691
I await my chance for a revenge.

2163
01:20:27,959 --> 01:20:29,161
The third line.

2164
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:32,631
Bang, bang, bang, I shoot.

2165
01:20:32,631 --> 01:20:35,267
(Bang, bang, bang, I shoot.)

2166
01:20:35,267 --> 01:20:37,702
("Bang, bang, bang, I shoot"?)

2167
01:20:37,702 --> 01:20:39,304
I find it funny.

2168
01:20:39,304 --> 01:20:42,207
I find it funny. "Bang, bang, bang, I shoot."

2169
01:20:42,207 --> 01:20:43,708
It's so ridiculous...

2170
01:20:43,842 --> 01:20:45,177
that it's funny.

2171
01:20:45,177 --> 01:20:47,179
I like ridiculous jokes.

2172
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,415
- The octopus is tasty. - The octopus is really tasty.

2173
01:20:50,415 --> 01:20:51,883
Try the octopus.

2174
01:20:52,017 --> 01:20:54,319
This is driving me crazy. Why did it pop up?

2175
01:20:54,519 --> 01:20:56,955
Would you give me...

2176
01:20:56,955 --> 01:20:58,990
a little bit of the soup?

2177
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:00,592
(Can't they hear me?)

2178
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:02,327
It's invigorating food.

2179
01:21:03,862 --> 01:21:05,230
- Really? - Yes.

2180
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,765
The soup is...

2181
01:21:06,765 --> 01:21:08,166
Please give me a little bit of the soup.

2182
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:11,269
The soup won't taste this way without these ingredients.

2183
01:21:11,503 --> 01:21:13,705
- How does the soup taste so good? - Seriously.

2184
01:21:13,705 --> 01:21:15,207
It's so tasty.

2185
01:21:15,974 --> 01:21:17,909
These jerks are too much.

2186
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:21,213
(These jerks are too much.)

2187
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:22,848
(Seok Jin explodes.)

2188
01:21:22,848 --> 01:21:25,083
Hold on. What was that?

2189
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:26,952
Don't be like that.

2190
01:21:26,952 --> 01:21:29,888
- Don't get angry. - You won't give me a bite.

2191
01:21:29,888 --> 01:21:31,990
(Don't you have the common courtesy before nine-seafood stew?)

2192
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:33,492
Thank you.

2193
01:21:33,492 --> 01:21:34,993
- It was delicious. - We had a good meal.

2194
01:21:34,993 --> 01:21:37,062
We are eating a lot of invigorating food today.

2195
01:21:37,062 --> 01:21:39,231
- Did you enjoy the food? - Yes.

2196
01:21:39,297 --> 01:21:40,332
Here is the result.

2197
01:21:40,332 --> 01:21:42,767
You succeeded the mission by eating 22 servings...

2198
01:21:42,767 --> 01:21:44,136
in five hours.

2199
01:21:44,136 --> 01:21:45,604
(The mission is a success.)

2200
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:47,305
- Yes! - Yes!

2201
01:21:48,039 --> 01:21:50,408
The member with the smallest number of meal badges...

2202
01:21:50,408 --> 01:21:51,943
will receive the penalty.

2203
01:21:51,943 --> 01:21:55,347
Currently, Seok Jin and So Min are tied...

2204
01:21:55,847 --> 01:21:57,215
with one meal badge each.

2205
01:21:57,215 --> 01:21:59,184
We will now have a death match...

2206
01:21:59,184 --> 01:22:02,454
to choose the person who will receive the penalty.

2207
01:22:02,454 --> 01:22:04,389
(The death match begins now.)

2208
01:22:04,389 --> 01:22:07,792
Stop the retracting tape measure to get the shorter length.

2209
01:22:08,393 --> 01:22:09,895
If it retracts all the way, you lose.

2210
01:22:09,895 --> 01:22:11,429
This is fun.

2211
01:22:11,429 --> 01:22:14,099
- This is so much fun. - Haha likes these games.

2212
01:22:14,099 --> 01:22:15,534
This is nerve-wracking.

2213
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:17,002
(Let's see who avoids the penalty.)

2214
01:22:17,002 --> 01:22:18,637
- I will go first. - Seok Jin will go first.

2215
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:21,373
This is the real round.

2216
01:22:21,806 --> 01:22:23,241
- All right. - I am so nervous.

2217
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:25,710
Get ready. You only have one chance.

2218
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:28,813
- What should I do? - Get ready.

2219
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:30,248
All right.

2220
01:22:30,248 --> 01:22:32,317
(How much can Seok Jin shorten the tape?)

2221
01:22:32,884 --> 01:22:34,186
(He stops it.)

2222
01:22:34,186 --> 01:22:35,387
All right.

2223
01:22:35,387 --> 01:22:38,089
- It's 50cm. - It's 53cm.

2224
01:22:38,089 --> 01:22:40,592
It's 53.5cm to be precise.

2225
01:22:40,659 --> 01:22:42,594
- It's long. - Make it shorter than that.

2226
01:22:42,594 --> 01:22:44,596
So Min, you can relax.

2227
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:46,164
I can't predict who will win.

2228
01:22:46,164 --> 01:22:48,066
- You can relax. - I am nervous.

2229
01:22:48,066 --> 01:22:49,568
Get ready.

2230
01:22:49,768 --> 01:22:51,770
Seok Jin's record is 53.5cm.

2231
01:22:51,770 --> 01:22:53,672
(Seok Jin's record is 53.5cm.)

2232
01:22:53,672 --> 01:22:59,978
(Can So Min make the tape shorter than 53.5cm?)

2233
01:23:00,178 --> 01:23:01,613
(Coming soon)

2234
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:04,049
(The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia)

2235
01:23:04,649 --> 01:23:06,017
- Goal! - Goal!

2236
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:08,386
(The beginning of the legend)

2237
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:10,155
Hurrah for Korea!

2238
01:23:10,922 --> 01:23:12,424
(The legends of the Korean soccer...)

2239
01:23:12,424 --> 01:23:16,228
(who made us laugh and cry will come.)

2240
01:23:16,928 --> 01:23:18,997
("All The Butlers" and the World Cup Legends will air shortly.)

2241
01:23:18,997 --> 01:23:20,999
Seok Jin's record is 53.5cm.

2242
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:22,934
(Seok Jin's record is 53.5cm.)

2243
01:23:22,934 --> 01:23:29,574
(Can So Min make the tape shorter than 53.5cm?)

2244
01:23:29,874 --> 01:23:31,409
Let's go.

2245
01:23:32,477 --> 01:23:33,812
The tape is long.

2246
01:23:34,246 --> 01:23:35,747
Let's go.

2247
01:23:36,781 --> 01:23:37,949
The tape is long.

2248
01:23:37,949 --> 01:23:40,752
(It doesn't look much different from Seok Jin's.)

2249
01:23:40,752 --> 01:23:42,153
No, no.

2250
01:23:42,153 --> 01:23:43,521
It's 50cm.

2251
01:23:45,156 --> 01:23:47,692
(So Min's record is 50cm.)

2252
01:23:47,692 --> 01:23:49,294
- It's 50cm. - 50cm.

2253
01:23:49,461 --> 01:23:52,564
(I can't believe it.)

2254
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:54,466
- It's 50cm. - It's 50cm.

2255
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:56,034
- Seok Jin gets the penalty. - Yes.

2256
01:23:56,334 --> 01:23:58,603
The result was divided by 3cm.

2257
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:00,839
It was a neck-and-neck match.

2258
01:24:00,839 --> 01:24:02,274
You are good.

2259
01:24:02,274 --> 01:24:03,975
(I can't believe you beat me.)

2260
01:24:03,975 --> 01:24:05,543
(She is bad at games, but Seok Jin is worse.)

2261
01:24:05,543 --> 01:24:06,544
You are good.

2262
01:24:06,544 --> 01:24:09,447
Thus, Seok Jin will receive the penalty.

2263
01:24:09,447 --> 01:24:11,750
(Seok Jin moves for a water bomb attack.)

2264
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:12,951
Okay.

2265
01:24:13,718 --> 01:24:17,022
Seok Jin will now receive the penalty.

2266
01:24:17,122 --> 01:24:19,291
- It's raining. - Yes, it is.

2267
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:21,793
- It's a good day to get a penalty. - That's right.

2268
01:24:21,793 --> 01:24:23,228
A water-related penalty on a rainy day.

2269
01:24:23,228 --> 01:24:26,031
You can hit above his face.

2270
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:27,465
(Throwing)

2271
01:24:27,465 --> 01:24:28,667
That's it.

2272
01:24:29,301 --> 01:24:31,736
(Popping)

2273
01:24:31,736 --> 01:24:32,904
- The above? - Yes.

2274
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:34,639
(Smile because this is a water bomb festival.)

2275
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,408
There you go.

2276
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:38,777
(It's a happy day.)

2277
01:24:38,777 --> 01:24:39,978
That was a nice shot.

2278
01:24:39,978 --> 01:24:41,279
(He straightens his shoulders...)

2279
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:43,748
(and aims for his target perfectly.)

2280
01:24:43,748 --> 01:24:46,251
(Popping)

2281
01:24:46,484 --> 01:24:48,086
This is fun.

2282
01:24:48,086 --> 01:24:49,254
(Never cry)

2283
01:24:49,254 --> 01:24:50,689
Hold on.

2284
01:24:50,789 --> 01:24:54,159
(Hitting)

2285
01:24:54,793 --> 01:24:57,829
My goodness.

2286
01:24:57,829 --> 01:24:59,931
Why is my aim so good today?

2287
01:24:59,931 --> 01:25:02,167
It just happened that way.

2288
01:25:02,167 --> 01:25:03,401
It can't be helped.

2289
01:25:03,702 --> 01:25:05,070
Who did that?

2290
01:25:05,236 --> 01:25:06,237
Come here.

2291
01:25:06,237 --> 01:25:08,306
(Wait until I catch you.)

2292
01:25:08,306 --> 01:25:09,874
(Seok Jin explodes for the 2nd time.)

2293
01:25:09,874 --> 01:25:11,109
My goodness.

2294
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:12,210
(No matter what anyone says,)

2295
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:14,846
- My goodness. - Seok Jin.

2296
01:25:14,846 --> 01:25:15,847
(today is Seok Jin's lucky day.)

2297
01:25:15,847 --> 01:25:17,248
All right.

2298
01:25:18,049 --> 01:25:21,486
(One peaceful day)

2299
01:25:21,486 --> 01:25:24,689
(A group of thieves showed up.)

2300
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:28,593
(The people were starving.)

2301
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:32,230
(They were waiting for someone who would rescue them.)

2302
01:25:32,497 --> 01:25:35,633
(These women joined to save the miserable people.)

2303
01:25:36,534 --> 01:25:38,770
(Son Dam Bi, a sniper after their hearts)

2304
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:42,073
(Gyeong Ree, charming master of smiles)

2305
01:25:43,274 --> 01:25:45,343
(Seo Eun Su, a golden thief)

2306
01:25:46,378 --> 01:25:48,713
(Lee Gook Ju, hunter looking for laughter)

2307
01:25:49,881 --> 01:25:52,083
(However,)

2308
01:25:52,083 --> 01:25:54,853
(the boss of the thieves and the king are hidden among them?)

2309
01:25:54,853 --> 01:25:57,722
(The boss must steal without getting caught by the king.)

2310
01:25:57,722 --> 01:26:01,226
(The king must sweep the group of thieves for the people.)

2311
01:26:01,226 --> 01:26:04,362
(Everything will go to waste the moment the identities are revealed.)

2312
01:26:04,362 --> 01:26:07,932
(Who will win at this mind game where they deceive each other?)

2313
01:26:09,134 --> 01:26:11,202
(Ms. Son, the poor civilian...)

2314
01:26:11,202 --> 01:26:14,139
(Mr. Thief, this is crazy)

2315
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:16,307
(Don't Trust Them)
