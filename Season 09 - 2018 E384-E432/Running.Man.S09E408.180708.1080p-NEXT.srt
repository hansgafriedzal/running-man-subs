1
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,255
(Previously on Running Man)

2
00:00:07,544 --> 00:00:10,385
(Two weeks ago, Luxury Package versus Shuddering Package began.)

3
00:00:10,847 --> 00:00:14,180
(They heard the good news that only 3 people can wing walk.)

4
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:17,065
(They had 4 missions to avoid wing walking.)

5
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:21,320
(Pirate Roulette decided who will have levels 1, 2, and 3.)

6
00:00:21,324 --> 00:00:24,735
(Jae Seok got level 1, Da Hee got level 2, and Kwang Soo got level 3.)

7
00:00:25,395 --> 00:00:29,875
(Jae Seok finished the experience as he screamed for freedom.)

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,505
(Meanwhile, Luxury Package in Switzerland)

9
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:36,640
(They had a train ride at the Alps and fondue at Observatory Hotel.)

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,515
(They finished the paragliding experience.)

11
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:43,110
(However, the tours had to be paid by the members.)

12
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,680
(A secret poll decided who will pay for each tour.)

13
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:47,150
(Jong Kook paid for the mountain railway train and fondue...)

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,750
(while Se Chan paid for paragliding.)

15
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,620
(There is a way to receive a refund.)

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,720
If you experience one...

17
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:56,265
(Experience one of the activities of Shuddering Package for a refund.)

18
00:00:56,393 --> 00:01:00,235
(Who will pay for the luxurious trip in the end?)

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,830
You paid for the cost of paragliding.

20
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,900
With the cost of heli-skiing...

21
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:07,915
and the cost of dining at a Michelin restaurant on the line,

22
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,000
we will play a game.

23
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,185
(The total comes to a big amount.)

24
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:13,810
- I hope I don't get chosen again. - This one is big.

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,040
- It must be around 1,000 dollars. - It has to cost over 1,000 dollars.

26
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:18,240
- I bet it costs over 2,000 dollars. - It's too expensive.

27
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:22,895
You will spin the roulette.

28
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:25,420
We will give you a roulette with eight slots.

29
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:28,990
- Eight? - You will decide the rules.

30
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:33,630
We talked among ourselves earlier.

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,275
We came up with 30 games.

32
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,000
- The game we can readily play... - We can stay up all night.

33
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:41,945
in this hotel is...

34
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:46,270
Spot the Difference. We can change things in the room...

35
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:48,940
and find what changed in a few seconds.

36
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:52,840
You have a minute. Change up the room in a minute...

37
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:55,110
and spot the difference in a minute.

38
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:58,080
- Find 5 differences. - 5 differences?

39
00:01:58,088 --> 00:02:02,920
This trio can be a team.

40
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,090
No, I don't want to do that.

41
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:06,320
- Why not? - Why not?

42
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,890
- Men versus women. - That's a good idea.

43
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:10,700
- Really? - It will be like "Family Arcade".

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,600
- "Family Arcade". - "What's the score?"

45
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:15,070
Hold on. None of us have a good memory.

46
00:02:15,071 --> 00:02:16,430
That's why I made this game.

47
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,540
That's why he wants us to be a team. That's why I refused.

48
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:19,840
That's not true.

49
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,340
The two of you slept together yesterday.

50
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:24,340
- We... - Don't say it like that.

51
00:02:24,347 --> 00:02:26,440
(Don't say it like that.)

52
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:29,880
The viewers will misunderstand. We are roommates.

53
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:31,220
We are roommates.

54
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,880
People will think we are closer than we actually are.

55
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,050
It's 3 against 3.

56
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,250
- It will be fun. - All right.

57
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,320
This place reminds me of "Guys N Girls".

58
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:41,005
- The sitcom! - That's right.

59
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,530
("Guys N Girls" was a sitcom that aired from 1996 to 1999.)

60
00:02:44,534 --> 00:02:47,315
(Shin Dong Yeob, Song Seung Heon)

61
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,630
(That's right.)

62
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,640
I am Song Seung Heon!

63
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:54,555
- I am Shin Dong Yup. - I'm Lee Eui Jung.

64
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:57,880
- You are Hong Kyung In. - Am I Hong Hyung In?

65
00:02:57,881 --> 00:03:01,080
Am I Hong Kyung In? I suddenly became Hong Kyung In.

66
00:03:01,084 --> 00:03:02,895
- I am Jennifer Lee. - Jenny.

67
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,850
- Hello. Let's go. - Let's go.

68
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:08,320
- Let's go. - Okay.

69
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:09,820
- Change up the room first. - You can go ahead.

70
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,420
Shall we go first? Okay.

71
00:03:11,428 --> 00:03:13,535
- Let's go. - Let's go.

72
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:15,690
(The team that answers the question observes the room for 30 seconds.)

73
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:18,445
When you open the door, we will be ready.

74
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:20,930
You have 30 seconds to spot the differences.

75
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:22,600
(The team that asks the question makes 5 differences.)

76
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:23,940
(The 3 losers get their names written on the roulette.)

77
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,670
- Hold on. - It's time to set the default.

78
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,115
This is the before.

79
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:30,540
- Why don't we use this shirt? - What do you mean?

80
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,525
(What is their plan to confuse Team Three Ladies?)

81
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:36,510
They are setting the default.

82
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,665
- The default? - Why are they doing that?

83
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,520
They should leave things as they are.

84
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:42,990
They will make things look unnatural from the beginning.

85
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,720
- They're too unnatural. - Gosh.

86
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:46,220
I saw it coming when they wanted to team up.

87
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:48,005
I didn't think Jong Kook was like that.

88
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:50,230
- He likes to force things. - He's crafty.

89
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,960
- Enter, and check right and left. - I will...

90
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:53,530
- Right, left, and the center. - Check right away.

91
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:54,975
- I'll take the center. - Okay.

92
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:56,875
(Opening)

93
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,800
- What? - Wait. Come on.

94
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,115
What was that?

95
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:04,355
(How did Team Three Guys set up the room for before the change?)

96
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:05,580
- What... - Wait.

97
00:04:05,582 --> 00:04:06,610
- Come on. - What is this?

98
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:08,255
(Their set-up clearly looks unnatural.)

99
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:17,905
(Remember the set-up of the room to spot 5 differences soon.)

100
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,490
Don't do this.

101
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,035
- Did you already decide on changes? - You guys...

102
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:25,975
This is confusing. Why are you guys in the room?

103
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,745
Why... Why did you do this?

104
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,845
Why am I still standing here?

105
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:33,785
I don't know about this. I really don't. We're ruined.

106
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,110
(Their strategy is to distract them.)

107
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:37,925
- He's crossing his left leg. - You have five seconds.

108
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:40,480
Gosh, I can't do this.

109
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:41,880
- Time's up. Come on out. - Gosh.

110
00:04:41,885 --> 00:04:42,910
- Please exit the room. - Goodness.

111
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:44,795
- Please exit the room. - Time's up. Please leave.

112
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:46,180
Please leave the room.

113
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,595
(Their 30 seconds to observe are over.)

114
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:51,265
(They're panicking and already lost.)

115
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:52,820
- Get ready. - Okay.

116
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:54,575
- Start. - Hey, move aside.

117
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:57,000
Take it off.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,200
(How will the room look after applying the changes?)

119
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:03,030
Since they're in the room, I get distracted to look at them.

120
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,840
- The guys are distracting indeed. - Right.

121
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,085
We have to check if there are cookies on top of the bed.

122
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:10,485
Darn it. I didn't check the shoes.

123
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,550
- I checked Jong Kook's shoes. - Gosh, I didn't check the shoes.

124
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,880
We'll give you 30 seconds. You can begin now.

125
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,150
- Let's go in at once. 1, 2, 3. - 3.

126
00:05:17,153 --> 00:05:18,925
(Can the ladies recognize the five changes?)

127
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:21,965
- 1, 2, 3. - 3.

128
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,905
Unbelievable.

129
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:26,365
The t-shirt.

130
00:05:26,763 --> 00:05:28,530
(He catches her eyes at first glance.)

131
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,705
(Is he the male version of the Statue of Liberty?)

132
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,100
(Did you spot their bold and unnatural changes?)

133
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:33,575
This is crazy.

134
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,710
(Viewers, most of you probably spotted the differences, right?)

135
00:05:44,714 --> 00:05:46,485
(3 minutes ago)

136
00:05:46,716 --> 00:05:50,055
- This? This? Do I switch these two? - You have 10 seconds.

137
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:52,625
(They began the grand-scale construction from that point on.)

138
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,435
- This. This. - This one?

139
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,590
Should we switch them?

140
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,405
(The second change is Haha's chair.)

141
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,260
(Se Chan's change is bolder than Haha's.)

142
00:05:59,262 --> 00:06:01,460
- Haha, tie this for me. - Hold on.

143
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:03,705
(They made four changes including Se Chan's goggles and gown.)

144
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,245
- The last one will be funny. - What is it?

145
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:07,745
(He holds a very big ice bucket instead of a small glass cup.)

146
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:10,345
(They aimed to be funny instead of making meticulous changes.)

147
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Okay.

148
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,915
(They aimed to win and to be entertaining.)

149
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,910
(Team Three Ladies is flustered by their bold changes.)

150
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:17,210
Gosh, this is crazy.

151
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,410
(Your changes are obvious.)

152
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,825
Se Chan changed.

153
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:21,050
Please be precise.

154
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,750
He changed his gown and goggles.

155
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,780
(She's confident.)

156
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,025
Those two changed.

157
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:30,035
(Just two changes? She didn't spot the ice bucket?)

158
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,265
(Trying to hold back his laughter)

159
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:33,775
Hey, your gown...

160
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,705
What's different about him? Hold on.

161
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,060
- Hey, you... - Gosh.

162
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,460
- Don't you think this is too much? - You have 10 seconds.

163
00:06:38,468 --> 00:06:39,930
And Haha...

164
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,430
(At that moment...)

165
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:43,000
(Did Han Na finally spot the difference?)

166
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,315
Haha's t-shirt...

167
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:45,500
and his hand's location.

168
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:46,640
(She's certain.)

169
00:06:46,643 --> 00:06:47,985
Why are you laughing?

170
00:06:48,544 --> 00:06:51,080
(Why is she talking about his t-shirt out of the blue?)

171
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,155
(Am I wrong?)

172
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:56,255
(After she senses Haha's scoffing, she doubts herself.)

173
00:06:56,853 --> 00:07:00,420
Wait, this. This, this. The location changed.

174
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:01,795
(Jin Young guesses wrongly about Jong Kook.)

175
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:05,190
- Or is it the frame? Is it? - Start with Se Chan first.

176
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:07,990
(Their 30 seconds are up. It's time to guess the changes.)

177
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:10,730
Se Chan's gown and goggles changed.

178
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,830
Seriously.

179
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,800
- What's wrong with her? - She's a fool.

180
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:15,330
- Hey, you fools. - They're so dumb.

181
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:17,940
- We made it so easy for you. - Next.

182
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,085
- What is it then? - The gown and goggles.

183
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:21,270
I want to go next.

184
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:23,585
We'll tell you the answers now.

185
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,025
How many did we get right?

186
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:27,580
Right now, you only figured out two.

187
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,810
- You got the goggles and the gown. - Okay.

188
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,880
I can't believe you didn't get the glass.

189
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,320
- I was so shocked. - Seriously.

190
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:35,595
- How could she not spot it? - That was just a giveaway.

191
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:37,520
We changed three things about Se Chan.

192
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,760
And Han Na was hilarious.

193
00:07:39,762 --> 00:07:42,775
- Didn't he change his t-shirt? - She said that my t-shirt changed.

194
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,200
- What's she going on about? - Your hand.

195
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:48,000
- Not my hand. I changed my chair. - He changed his chair.

196
00:07:48,004 --> 00:07:49,370
- He switched the chairs. - How can you not...

197
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:51,900
- I was just giving this away. - How could you not spot that?

198
00:07:51,908 --> 00:07:54,410
- I changed nothing about myself. - Right. I didn't either.

199
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,240
- How could you not see that? - This is unfair.

200
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,955
Let's switch teams.

201
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:00,555
- She's like Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo, does it fit with the look?

202
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,010
Does this go well with the look? I mean, let's be honest.

203
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:05,280
- It was funny that she didn't know. - It was really funny.

204
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,420
Didn't I tell you earlier?

205
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:08,620
- Our team has a bad memory. - How many did they get right?

206
00:08:08,624 --> 00:08:10,290
- 2. - 2? Okay. Let's switch.

207
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:11,560
- Let's switch. - Two.

208
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:14,390
- Han Na, weren't you shocked? - We made major changes, not small.

209
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,590
- I had no idea. - You guys...

210
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,845
- She had no idea. - Haha, Haha.

211
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:21,215
She has the best detective skills indeed.

212
00:08:21,437 --> 00:08:23,030
We didn't make small changes.

213
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,440
- Please leave. - We didn't even touch minor things.

214
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,900
- I thought that it looked easy. - It's over.

215
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,355
(It's time for Team Three Ladies' turn to set up the room.)

216
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:31,125
- We should... Yes, I agree. - We should make it fun.

217
00:08:31,214 --> 00:08:33,210
- The three of us. - Hey, look. Let's do this.

218
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:36,150
We should cross our hands and legs...

219
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:39,065
- and make funny faces. - Or we can stand on top of this.

220
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:44,135
We can strike weird poses.

221
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,135
Our blood won't circulate.

222
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:49,205
That's it. Just like this.

223
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:50,830
(To get back at them, she plays dead.)

224
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,830
(And she copies Se Chan's pose.)

225
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,005
Gosh, this is hard.

226
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,600
(It's so hard. We have to go the extra mile, right?)

227
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,640
I got a cramp in one of my legs.

228
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,755
- This is so hard. - It is.

229
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:04,485
- This is before the changes, right? - We'll enter after 3 seconds.

230
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,355
They're here.

231
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:08,395
- They're coming in. - Three.

232
00:09:08,484 --> 00:09:10,355
2, 1.

233
00:09:10,453 --> 00:09:11,665
Go.

234
00:09:12,021 --> 00:09:13,120
Is this before the changes?

235
00:09:13,122 --> 00:09:14,620
(You did some stuff around here.)

236
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:16,150
- Take the left corner first. - They worked hard.

237
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,420
- Look at the big picture. - You prepared a lot.

238
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:18,735
(You prepared a lot.)

239
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,965
She's near the window.

240
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,130
I see.

241
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,190
(They observe closely for 30 seconds.)

242
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:25,660
Left hand, apple. Right hand, orange.

243
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,045
She's good.

244
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:29,800
- Let's wait and see. - She's looking at something.

245
00:09:29,806 --> 00:09:31,470
- You have 10 seconds. - The left leg is on top.

246
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:33,140
- Okay. - Get out. It's getting hard.

247
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,740
- Get out now. Hurry. - Okay.

248
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,770
It's hard.

249
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,955
(Their 30 seconds to observe are over.)

250
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:40,925
(Let's hurry up and apply the changes.)

251
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,125
(To match the guys' bold changes, they make their own bold changes.)

252
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,750
- I changed it. - You did?

253
00:09:46,756 --> 00:09:48,965
(She forgets about her image and puts on a disguise.)

254
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:53,305
(Wait and see, Team Three Guys.)

255
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,075
(We're trying so hard.)

256
00:09:56,299 --> 00:09:58,560
(The set-ups clearly look forced.)

257
00:09:58,568 --> 00:09:59,875
- Hold on. - I changed the earrings.

258
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,800
(In pain)

259
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:03,775
I got a leg cramp. I should use the other leg.

260
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,940
(They put their 30 seconds into good use and complete their set-up.)

261
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,215
This is hard.

262
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:13,125
(Clueless of these changes, Team Three Guys sets out.)

263
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:14,695
Is my posture okay?

264
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:15,995
When will we start?

265
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:17,550
- Okay. - We're coming in.

266
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:19,925
(Team Three Ladies' shocking changes which they spared nothing for)

267
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:23,735
(Can Team Three Guys spot all the changes?)

268
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,865
Let's see.

269
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:27,975
What? What is this?

270
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:30,860
(Is Team Three Guys flustered as expected?)

271
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:32,030
What should I do?

272
00:10:32,034 --> 00:10:34,615
(The guys are flustered.)

273
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,815
- Wait. The location changed. - Hold on a second.

274
00:10:36,973 --> 00:10:39,445
- I think the rug has been pushed. - Was the remote here before?

275
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,140
- The location seems different. - Wait a second.

276
00:10:41,143 --> 00:10:45,210
(What? You can't spot these changes?)

277
00:10:45,214 --> 00:10:46,955
Her right and left legs seem correct.

278
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,995
(Are they pretending not to have recognized the obvious changes?)

279
00:10:51,587 --> 00:10:53,890
She had the orange in her left hand and grapes in her right.

280
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,935
But if she changed those, it won't be fun.

281
00:10:56,993 --> 00:10:59,090
Or should we not guess them on purpose?

282
00:10:59,095 --> 00:11:00,605
"Wait, what is this?"

283
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,075
Should we pretend to do that?

284
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:04,205
- I like it. - Sofa... The remote changed.

285
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,700
Imagine how happy they would feel. "He's so dumb."

286
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:08,570
(They're immature just like elementary school kids.)

287
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,675
- Should we get them wrong? - Just on purpose?

288
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,500
- As a present in Switzerland? - Yes.

289
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:13,840
- It's a gift. - So we can make them happy.

290
00:11:13,843 --> 00:11:14,840
Should we give them a gift?

291
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:15,940
(It was the guys' plan to prank them.)

292
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:17,940
- The crease of the sofa... - Her legs seem correct.

293
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:19,010
(Thus began the festival of their poor acting.)

294
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:20,810
(Oh, no. I can't spot any differences at all.)

295
00:11:20,816 --> 00:11:23,355
Wait, the charger. The line was on top.

296
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,650
- They're doing it on purpose. - Hold on. Wait.

297
00:11:25,655 --> 00:11:27,220
- We don't have much time left. - How many seconds do we have?

298
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:28,920
- This is so annoying. - Wait a second.

299
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:30,320
- You have 10 seconds. - It's not here.

300
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,820
- Hold on. My gosh. - Wait!

301
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:34,105
- Come on. - What did they change?

302
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,035
- What did they change? - Three seconds.

303
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:37,675
What changed?

304
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,400
- Is our time up? - The weather has changed!

305
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:40,670
- Time is up. - You... You...

306
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:43,200
(What did he say? The weather has changed?)

307
00:11:43,205 --> 00:11:44,885
- You can go 1st. - I'll go 1st.

308
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:49,070
There were 3 creases before, but there are 4 now.

309
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:50,310
- Okay. - Four.

310
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,855
I named two changes.

311
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:54,550
- My goodness. - The leather got peeled off.

312
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,480
- Totally. I was going to say that. - Right. Okay.

313
00:11:57,486 --> 00:11:59,650
- I was going to say that. - This looked different before.

314
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,690
I saw a definite change. Look at her. Come here.

315
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:03,960
(Did Haha spot a change on Han Na?)

316
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,765
Look at her now. Her pants got one more line.

317
00:12:07,797 --> 00:12:09,360
(How intriguing.)

318
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:11,260
- One more line on the side. - Good eyes, Haha.

319
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:12,530
- That has to be one of the changes. - Okay.

320
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,900
- Isn't it? Right? - Okay.

321
00:12:13,903 --> 00:12:15,030
- Seriously. - You.

322
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:16,370
- The weather. - The weather? Okay.

323
00:12:16,372 --> 00:12:17,615
These are our answers.

324
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,315
We definitely got all of them.

325
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:22,110
- Unbelievable. - You didn't get anything right.

326
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,455
- You didn't get anything right. - What?

327
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:24,840
- What are you talking about? - No way.

328
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,810
- No way. - You're so annoying.

329
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,310
- Come here. Come. - Tell us the answers.

330
00:12:28,317 --> 00:12:29,980
- What? Why? - Who said that you could act?

331
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,020
- We weren't acting. - What's wrong with you?

332
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:33,880
- Who said that you could act? - What's going on?

333
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,490
- Who said? - We did our best.

334
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,090
- You made us into fools. - Stop lying.

335
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,660
- What do you mean? - Gosh, Jong Kook.

336
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:40,390
- You have changed. - Gosh.

337
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:42,890
- Your acting was awkward. - You knew all of our changes.

338
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,030
What did you change?

339
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,460
- We really didn't know. - What? "The weather has changed?"

340
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:47,000
- "The weather has changed?" - The weather was different before.

341
00:12:47,003 --> 00:12:48,000
It changed over 30 seconds?

342
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,000
- No, it was really different. - It took so long.

343
00:12:50,006 --> 00:12:51,385
(Their prank is a success.)

344
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,970
- Is that what you want? - Gosh, you startled me.

345
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:55,315
- What? What is it? - Hey.

346
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,940
(Do you know how hard we worked to prepare it?)

347
00:12:57,947 --> 00:12:59,910
- What? What is it? - Hold on. Come here.

348
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:01,450
- Why? - Listen.

349
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,750
- Look. - Why? What's this about?

350
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:04,780
- Why did you do that? - Listen.

351
00:13:04,787 --> 00:13:06,320
- Was it not fun for you? - I don't understand.

352
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:07,690
- Why? Why did you do it? - We were serious.

353
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,850
- Why did you do that? - We really didn't know.

354
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:11,760
- We couldn't spot the changes. - It looked exactly the same.

355
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:14,430
- You three worked very hard. - You were geniuses.

356
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,805
- How annoying. You're a good actor. - We focused on...

357
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:18,360
- We focused on the objects. - Jong Kook.

358
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:19,705
You're a great talker.

359
00:13:20,036 --> 00:13:21,830
The victory goes to Team Three Ladies.

360
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:24,670
- Why don't I feel good about this? - No, we lost.

361
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,570
Write down your names on the roulette.

362
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:28,210
Let's write it down. We have to write our names on each slot.

363
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,210
- We wrote down our names. - They wrote on the roulette.

364
00:13:30,212 --> 00:13:31,555
We wrote our names down.

365
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,910
(It's time for their meal which will restore their peace of mind.)

366
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,380
We have four forks.

367
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:38,450
- I don't know which one to use. - There are five.

368
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:39,580
(A luxurious meal prepared by a Michelin star chef)

369
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:41,550
- Great. - To be honest, dining...

370
00:13:41,557 --> 00:13:45,690
It's a Michelin-starred restaurant, and we also get to see the view.

371
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:48,190
Right, the view is beautiful.

372
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:49,835
Here we are.

373
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,775
I'm Yang Cruise.

374
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,130
- This is Yang Cruise. - I'm Seung Ri.

375
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:55,675
I look like Seung Ri.

376
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:58,400
That's right. He looks like Seung Ri.

377
00:13:58,407 --> 00:13:59,870
I'm like Seung Ri in Switzerland.

378
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,940
Why did you change into robes?

379
00:14:01,944 --> 00:14:04,015
I dress like this at home.

380
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:05,655
- What? - What is it?

381
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:08,055
- Han Na's hairband is pretty. - I finished making it.

382
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:10,650
- It's the prettiest thing you wore. - It's the prettiest.

383
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:13,880
- That's it. - It looks great on you.

384
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:16,090
- You should wear it. - It looks perfect on you.

385
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,790
- Really? - You look like a cosmetics model.

386
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:19,560
- Seriously. - It's the face before washing.

387
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:21,560
It's Swiss cosmetics and toner.

388
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:23,705
You look perfect for that.

389
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:26,300
Han Na, make a toast.

390
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:28,075
Let's have a glass of champagne.

391
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm not used to making a toast. What should I say?

392
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,270
Ask Jin Young.

393
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:35,455
- What should I say? - Jin Young is good at this.

394
00:14:35,578 --> 00:14:37,110
(Shall I teach you?)

395
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,980
It's bottoms up, right?

396
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,050
How long will you make me hold my glass?

397
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,950
One shot outside the neighborhood.

398
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:46,780
- One shot outside the neighborhood - One shot outside the neighborhood

399
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:47,850
(Jin Young leads the toast.)

400
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:51,160
(Despite a humble toast, they drink elegantly.)

401
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,035
Gosh, champagne.

402
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,190
It's really delicious.

403
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:56,560
- The champagne is good. - Gosh, champagne.

404
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:58,075
It's very good.

405
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,430
They're oysters.

406
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:01,870
I love oysters.

407
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:03,630
These are appetizers.

408
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,570
- Enjoy them. - Are these appetizers?

409
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:06,640
Yes, they are.

410
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:10,470
(This is what a Michelin-starred restaurant offers.)

411
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:13,280
(Fresh lobster and cheese)

412
00:15:13,282 --> 00:15:15,955
(Chewy mini pizzas)

413
00:15:16,018 --> 00:15:20,165
(Including tuna, squid, and oysters, the appetizers are sophisticated.)

414
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,290
(Shall I taste some?)

415
00:15:24,293 --> 00:15:25,720
How many times did I say it?

416
00:15:25,728 --> 00:15:27,975
- The squid tastes amazing. - Is it?

417
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:29,760
It's amazing.

418
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:33,000
(Squid can't be that amazing.)

419
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:36,175
- It's amazing. - It's not fishy at all.

420
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,040
- Is it lobster? - It's good.

421
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,940
(Appetizers at a Michelin-starred restaurant are impressive.)

422
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:43,855
- Do you see the man over there? - Yes.

423
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,710
- He's the chef. - Hello.

424
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:48,310
(He's a top chef in the industry.)

425
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:49,680
- Hello. - Hello.

426
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:50,810
(It's nice to meet you.)

427
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:53,450
Welcome. I'm Alfonso, the chef.

428
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:57,560
It's a big pleasure to prepare dinner for you.

429
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,490
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

430
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:04,700
It's interesting how he makes food in the kitchen next to us.

431
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,130
Here's something about the oysters.

432
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:08,900
This is what I just heard. There's no ocean near Switzerland.

433
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:12,270
- Right. - They're caught in Italy.

434
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,570
- For four hours... - Isn't Italy next to Switzerland?

435
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:15,855
They're sent by plane over four hours.

436
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,385
Really?

437
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,910
- That means these are very fresh. - Right.

438
00:16:19,915 --> 00:16:22,855
- They were caught four hours ago. - Yes.

439
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,550
(Shall we have a taste of the Mediterranean Sea?)

440
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:29,035
(He slurps it in one go.)

441
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:30,865
Oysters are like milk.

442
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,390
It's very delicious.

443
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:33,790
(This is only the start.)

444
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:36,660
(Get ready for amazing scallops.)

445
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:40,800
Would you like to taste our Petite Arvine wine?

446
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:43,170
- White wine? - Do you want to taste some?

447
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:46,840
This is white wine that goes well with the first course dish.

448
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:48,270
- We should listen to him. - Thank you.

449
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:50,215
Switzerland.

450
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,480
I need to express well.

451
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:58,195
Look at her swirl. She's drank a lot of wine.

452
00:16:58,754 --> 00:17:00,220
(She smells it first.)

453
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:01,650
- You look fancy. - Smell it first.

454
00:17:01,657 --> 00:17:04,820
Put it closer to your nose.

455
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:06,820
Right, that's how you smell it.

456
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,030
(After smelling it,)

457
00:17:09,031 --> 00:17:12,230
(she gargles it three times.)

458
00:17:12,234 --> 00:17:14,430
(She saw it somewhere.)

459
00:17:14,436 --> 00:17:15,675
(Slurping)

460
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,740
(She's trying her best.)

461
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,440
(Why is she being so frivolous?)

462
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:22,340
- That's good. - Stop it.

463
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,785
How does it taste?

464
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:25,880
I like her a lot.

465
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:28,310
(How does the wine taste?)

466
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:30,125
- How is it? - It tastes...

467
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:32,795
- It tastes like... - Is it astringent?

468
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:35,850
It tastes like cow leather. Can you check if it's right?

469
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,560
- Really? - Could you ask him?

470
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,630
She said that she could smell the leather of cow.

471
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:44,530
(It tasted like cow leather.)

472
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,700
- Are you sure? - There are many cows in the region.

473
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:48,130
- Really? - Yes.

474
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:49,730
There are many cows around.

475
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,340
- Really? - Yes.

476
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,870
Does it smell like cow leather?

477
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,585
- It has a cow leather flavor. - Really?

478
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,640
How do you know how cow leather tastes?

479
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:58,185
Is it from a watch strap?

480
00:17:58,247 --> 00:18:00,740
- I'm not sure. Can I try again? - No, you can't.

481
00:18:00,749 --> 00:18:03,225
(She tastes some more to verify.)

482
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,125
(She slurps.)

483
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:08,020
(What did Han Na taste?)

484
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:10,035
- How is it? - It'll taste like what he said.

485
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:11,965
It tastes like cheese.

486
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:14,760
She can smell the cheese.

487
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:15,860
- Yes. - Cheese?

488
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,390
- Yes. - Right?

489
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,500
(She guessed it correctly again.)

490
00:18:19,501 --> 00:18:21,415
She's a sommelier.

491
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,000
- She's Sommelier Kang. - It's not easy.

492
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:25,070
(As she finishes her tasting,)

493
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:29,010
(the first dish is served.)

494
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:33,425
(Scallop with carrot mayonnaise, onion jam, beet, and pineapple)

495
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,655
The colors are beautiful.

496
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:41,295
(She takes grilled scallop with carrot mayonnaise.)

497
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,090
(Flavors explode in their mouths.)

498
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:47,160
How is it?

499
00:18:47,162 --> 00:18:50,535
It's sweet and savory.

500
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,045
- You must eat all together. - Eat them all together.

501
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:58,385
Try some with pineapple and pumpkin. It's so delicious.

502
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,470
Is everything okay?

503
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:01,215
- Yes. - It's amazing.

504
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:03,770
The taste is like walking in paradise.

505
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,925
May we watch him cook?

506
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,110
You may.

507
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:08,395
- May we watch? - Yes.

508
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:13,680
(The chef is cooking pasta.)

509
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:16,935
It looks like cream. The noodles are thin.

510
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:18,865
- Gosh. - Goodness.

511
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:21,330
- It's so pretty. - It's pretty.

512
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,535
It's amazing. It's served with truffles.

513
00:19:23,832 --> 00:19:25,800
- It's served with truffles. - Really?

514
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,915
That amount of truffles...

515
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:29,730
is very expensive.

516
00:19:29,738 --> 00:19:31,785
- It's blended and served. - It's blended.

517
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:33,915
Give us a lot, Chef.

518
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:36,410
(Give us a lot of truffles.)

519
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:38,425
I'm excited about the pasta.

520
00:19:43,886 --> 00:19:46,365
- How do we eat it? - Eat it like this.

521
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:48,050
(He wraps the pasta around the fork.)

522
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,735
What should I do?

523
00:19:49,892 --> 00:19:51,835
My goodness.

524
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:53,420
Do you like it?

525
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:55,205
(Slurping)

526
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,605
(This is how it tastes.)

527
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,015
Would you like to have some more truffles?

528
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:03,870
Thank you.

529
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,070
Seriously.

530
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,900
I thought it'd be salty, but it's not.

531
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:08,855
Does anyone want more truffles?

532
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:11,140
The flavor is amazing.

533
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:13,110
(The flavor satisfies all five senses.)

534
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:14,610
The flavor is incredible.

535
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:16,555
(Se Chan also gets more truffles.)

536
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,025
Thank you, thank you.

537
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,620
(He slurps very loudly.)

538
00:20:22,624 --> 00:20:24,765
Who keeps eating jjolmyeon?

539
00:20:26,061 --> 00:20:28,730
(Who keeps eating jjolmyeon?)

540
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,300
(Se Chan teleports everyone to a cheap restaurant.)

541
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,645
Those who have tasted it can enjoy it, right?

542
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:37,030
(We never had it either.)

543
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,000
I feel a bit behind.

544
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:41,485
It's so funny because he's being honest.

545
00:20:41,743 --> 00:20:45,710
Try some pasta with shrimp.

546
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:47,610
It's so delicious.

547
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:49,855
- The noodles are... - Try it like this, Ji Hyo.

548
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,320
Have some pasta.

549
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,520
(Fill your mouth with pasta.)

550
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,890
Dip the shrimp and then eat it.

551
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,865
It's like dipping in chojang.

552
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,820
The noodles are different.

553
00:20:58,827 --> 00:21:01,005
- They get dry. - They get dry?

554
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,305
(He slurps loudly.)

555
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,770
(Slurping and sucking)

556
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,700
(The sound doesn't belong at this restaurant.)

557
00:21:10,706 --> 00:21:12,740
It's not regular pasta.

558
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:17,285
(An amazing main dish gets ready to be served.)

559
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,495
(Pork steak and cheese souffle with red wine sauce)

560
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:24,795
It breaks easily.

561
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:28,420
(Let's taste it.)

562
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:31,990
(Team Switzerland is enchanted by the taste of paradise.)

563
00:21:31,994 --> 00:21:34,630
(Who will be paying for their expensive meal?)

564
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,460
- I'm getting teary-eyed. - Why?

565
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,775
- I'm moved. - Since you're treated so well?

566
00:21:39,268 --> 00:21:40,860
This is very luxurious.

567
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,430
(It's time to account the costs.)

568
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,170
Everyone, did you enjoy your meal?

569
00:21:45,173 --> 00:21:46,270
- Yes. - Yes.

570
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,085
The amount will be very high.

571
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,070
It's heli-skiing and a Michelin-starred restaurant.

572
00:21:50,078 --> 00:21:52,080
We talked about how much 1kg of truffle costs.

573
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,580
- It's 3,000 dollars. - He gave us a lot.

574
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,710
He blended a lot.

575
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:57,750
- We must decide. - Right.

576
00:21:57,753 --> 00:22:01,550
- The restaurant and helicopter. - The restaurant and helicopter.

577
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:03,550
This is the last game.

578
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:05,135
(Who will be unlucky?)

579
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,535
Next is Da Hee.

580
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,590
This is level two for Da Hee.

581
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,730
Is she doing it?

582
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,100
The ride will include a twist.

583
00:22:14,102 --> 00:22:15,415
(Level 2 will be difficult.)

584
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,575
- What is a twist? - I tried it before.

585
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,640
My goodness.

586
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:23,955
(A twist tilts by 70 degrees.)

587
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,950
- I tried it before. It's doable. - What is a twist?

588
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,680
(Don't worry.)

589
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:32,950
What do you mean? You never tried it.

590
00:22:32,955 --> 00:22:36,090
- Have you tried it? - You never rode with a twist.

591
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:37,750
- Didn't you see me? - You didn't do anything.

592
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:40,220
I gave the pilot a signal, and he turned the plane.

593
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,590
It was like a sailboat ride on a river.

594
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,390
(Stop lying.)

595
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,700
Do you know anything about twists?

596
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:46,800
- What? - Have you tried them?

597
00:22:46,802 --> 00:22:49,070
- I was on a sailboat? - It seemed that way.

598
00:22:49,071 --> 00:22:50,370
You looked at ease.

599
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:54,670
It was really stable. Da Hee, don't worry so much.

600
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:57,510
- I polished most of the routes. - What?

601
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,755
There are routes in the sky. Don't you know that?

602
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:01,480
There are routes in the sky.

603
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,950
What you did is different from what Da Hee will do.

604
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:06,680
As the leader of the adventure...

605
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,250
Didn't you cry a moment ago?

606
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,850
(You're not a leader.)

607
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,420
No? Didn't you cry?

608
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:15,775
- I didn't cry. - What kind of a leader cries?

609
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,460
Why would a leader cry during a sailboat ride?

610
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,700
"A sailboat"?

611
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:22,070
It wasn't a sailboat.

612
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,700
What are you talking about?

613
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:25,300
Your lips are very dry.

614
00:23:25,307 --> 00:23:28,285
Weren't you scared when you went up?

615
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,510
Is it scary?

616
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,880
- Take me as an example. - Weren't you scared?

617
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,680
When your emotions start to collide,

618
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:38,180
how do you control your mind?

619
00:23:38,186 --> 00:23:40,825
What you concentrate on is very important.

620
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,665
He almost passed out when he landed.

621
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:45,165
He was shaking. I saw it.

622
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:48,960
- He was almost unconscious. - Be quiet.

623
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:51,130
- "Be quiet." - You're shameless.

624
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:54,500
- Stop making fun of me. - I saw it.

625
00:23:54,503 --> 00:23:56,470
- You passed out. - Gosh.

626
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,900
Da Hee seems excited.

627
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,545
She should enjoy it. She's our girl crush.

628
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,685
(I have something on my goggles.)

629
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:05,480
(Let me use your sweater.)

630
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,325
(Wiping)

631
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:12,095
- Do I have to stand it? - What's wrong with you?

632
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:13,650
What are you doing?

633
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:15,690
- What are you doing? - Blow on my goggles.

634
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:17,465
Blow on them. Yes.

635
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,320
- Why? - They have lip balm on them.

636
00:24:20,328 --> 00:24:22,190
Da Hee, that's meaningless.

637
00:24:22,197 --> 00:24:24,090
- Why? I want to see. - Once you go up...

638
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:25,700
- What? - I want to see.

639
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:27,030
I guess you do.

640
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:29,230
(You want to enjoy the view?)

641
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:31,600
I just let my goggles fog up.

642
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:32,745
(Then I don't see anything.)

643
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:34,885
I want some black tape on my goggles.

644
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:36,755
It was better when my goggles fogged up.

645
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:39,180
- Should I go now? - Next up is Da Hee.

646
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:40,485
Girl crush.

647
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,880
- She's so cool. - She's our girl crush.

648
00:24:42,884 --> 00:24:45,780
- You can do this! - So Min, watch me.

649
00:24:45,787 --> 00:24:46,980
Let's do this!

650
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:51,465
Level two includes a twist.

651
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,465
I won't fall off, will I?

652
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,230
- She's our girl crush. - Da Hee must be...

653
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,975
the bravest one among us.

654
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:03,045
You can follow me so far. You can come up here.

655
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:06,570
- Wait. I'll go first. - Okay.

656
00:25:06,575 --> 00:25:08,115
(She shows no sign of fear.)

657
00:25:09,878 --> 00:25:13,540
Good. That's it.

658
00:25:13,548 --> 00:25:15,280
There we go.

659
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:16,380
Welcome.

660
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,895
- Da Hee is already up there. - That was fast.

661
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:21,080
Didn't Jae Seok take 30 minutes to get there?

662
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,450
(It's a huge difference.)

663
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:23,995
She went up so fast.

664
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:29,560
(10-times speed)

665
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:33,400
(The preparation took longer than the actual flying.)

666
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:36,130
I felt so sorry for Jae Seok.

667
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:39,485
- So did I. - His legs were shaking.

668
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:42,070
I'll come and get you when you're finished.

669
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,385
- Thank you. - Have fun.

670
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:46,725
(The pilot gets in the cockpit.)

671
00:25:46,748 --> 00:25:49,480
Da Hee will go up a bit higher.

672
00:25:49,484 --> 00:25:50,880
- Really? - To be able to do a twist.

673
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,825
- To do a twist? - She'll go up higher?

674
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:56,335
- It was high last time too. - Level three will be even higher.

675
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:59,590
Kwang Soo, watch me.

676
00:25:59,594 --> 00:26:01,930
You can do this! Aren't you scared?

677
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,330
- No. I'm excited. - She seems so relaxed.

678
00:26:04,332 --> 00:26:07,405
- She seems really relaxed. - Look how she's sitting.

679
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,645
- She's so relaxed. - Her position looks relaxed.

680
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:12,200
(If you're ready...)

681
00:26:12,207 --> 00:26:13,270
Clear.

682
00:26:13,275 --> 00:26:14,745
(Let me start the airplane.)

683
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:19,980
(The propeller starts spinning.)

684
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:21,655
She's not holding on to anything.

685
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:25,120
She's putting on lip balm.

686
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,080
- What? - She's putting on lip balm.

687
00:26:27,088 --> 00:26:28,390
(She makes sure she looks good.)

688
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:31,050
- She's so relaxed. - It's incredible.

689
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:34,960
She seems happy.

690
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,175
(The airplane starts to move.)

691
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,845
(Fiddling)

692
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:42,475
(She fixes the self-camera angle.)

693
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:43,600
Will this work?

694
00:26:43,605 --> 00:26:45,385
(She's finding the right angle.)

695
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,910
She looks like a general.

696
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,010
She's amazing.

697
00:26:51,012 --> 00:26:55,225
I'm sorry to say this, but Jae Seok looked miserable.

698
00:26:55,884 --> 00:26:58,155
It reminded me of "Old Partner".

699
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,390
- It had the same feeling. - I know what you mean.

700
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,305
I get it.

701
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:08,535
(The airplane arrives at the takeoff point.)

702
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,275
(Here we go.)

703
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,460
(Preparing for level 2,)

704
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:19,245
(the airplane starts to accelerate.)

705
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:22,585
(Da Hee relaxedly fixes her helmet.)

706
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:25,080
- It's taking off. - It's moving.

707
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,825
- It's moving. - It's taken off.

708
00:27:28,884 --> 00:27:31,625
(The wheels leave the ground.)

709
00:27:32,587 --> 00:27:35,790
(The airplane flies up at high speed.)

710
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,050
This is nice.

711
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:38,220
(It's refreshing.)

712
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,760
Look at her hands.

713
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,590
It looks as if she's controlling the airplane.

714
00:27:42,597 --> 00:27:44,175
With one hand there.

715
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,175
It's beautiful.

716
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,275
(She waves at the camera.)

717
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:51,840
It's fantastic.

718
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,800
(Amazed)

719
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:54,840
(Let me show you.)

720
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:57,370
Look at the fields.

721
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:02,925
(She even films the beautiful view herself.)

722
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,125
(Her legs are in the air.)

723
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:08,120
Her legs are in the air.

724
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,720
- What? - Her legs are in the air.

725
00:28:09,724 --> 00:28:12,090
Her legs are in the air? Why?

726
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,390
- Really? - Her legs are in the air.

727
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:14,860
- Her legs are in the air. - Why?

728
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:16,860
- Da Hee... - It's like raising your hands.

729
00:28:16,865 --> 00:28:18,190
How will I look compared to her?

730
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,805
(She's making him look like a coward.)

731
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:23,500
When my leg moved a bit, I put it back right away.

732
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:24,500
(He kept his legs in place.)

733
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,185
Da Hee, be careful with your legs.

734
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:31,585
(Her legs are still in the air.)

735
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,625
(She is enjoying wing-walking to the fullest.)

736
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:39,265
(The real fun starts now.)

737
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:42,335
(The airplane tilts.)

738
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:46,390
(The twist starts.)

739
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:49,075
(The strong wind makes her mouth twist.)

740
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:53,075
- That must be the twist. - That's...

741
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:56,275
- Here we go. - Compared to Jae Seok...

742
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:00,445
(It tilts the other way.)

743
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:04,470
(The airplane is rocking from side to side.)

744
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,455
(This is pretty scary.)

745
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,580
- That must be the twist. - Here we go.

746
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:11,580
(That looks scary.)

747
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:12,725
Da Hee.

748
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:14,420
She's incredible.

749
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,595
(Da Hee is amazing.)

750
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:22,335
(After the twist, the airplane shoots up.)

751
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:25,145
(She can't control her face.)

752
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:28,800
It must be scary when the airplane tilts.

753
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:30,970
It's completely different from what Jae Seok experienced.

754
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:33,070
- It is. - It's completely different.

755
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,370
- It's not that different. - It is.

756
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:37,470
The only difference is that the airplane tilts a bit.

757
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,580
There was nothing like this when you tried.

758
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,280
It only moved forward.

759
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:43,725
(It only moved forward when Jae Seok tried.)

760
00:29:44,452 --> 00:29:47,280
Be quiet.

761
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,965
What do you know? Gosh.

762
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:52,735
(Da Hee is experiencing vigorous twists.)

763
00:29:52,927 --> 00:29:55,835
(Her face twists too.)

764
00:29:55,864 --> 00:29:58,645
(She covers her face.)

765
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,745
(Is it time to get down?)

766
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,130
- They're coming down. - They're coming.

767
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:05,545
She did a good job.

768
00:30:05,707 --> 00:30:06,700
(What will level 3 be like?)

769
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,855
Good job, Da Hee.

770
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:11,085
Please wave at us.

771
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:13,525
(She waves relaxedly.)

772
00:30:14,182 --> 00:30:17,480
- She still looks relaxed. - She's so relaxed.

773
00:30:17,485 --> 00:30:19,925
I should treat her like a big brother from now.

774
00:30:21,956 --> 00:30:24,565
- Well done. - Thank you.

775
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:26,660
- The wind is very strong, right? - You did a great job.

776
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:29,030
The problem is not that it's scary.

777
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,130
Your helmet strap keeps hitting your face.

778
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,500
- Be careful. - How was it, Da Hee?

779
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:38,030
It was beautiful. It must have been very enjoyable for you.

780
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,670
- You're right. - Did you enjoy it?

781
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:41,700
No.

782
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,310
(I didn't enjoy it.)

783
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:46,380
When the airplane tilts,

784
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:48,310
- is it scary? - It is.

785
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:52,080
Right before the twist, the airplane goes down.

786
00:30:52,087 --> 00:30:54,820
It feels very scary.

787
00:30:54,823 --> 00:30:57,190
- It's like a pirate ship ride. - Really?

788
00:30:57,192 --> 00:30:59,060
- It goes down so fast. - Kwang Soo must be worried.

789
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:02,960
- All right. Finally... - Poor Kwang Soo.

790
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:06,660
In addition to the twist, Kwang Soo will experience a vertical descent.

791
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:10,315
A vertical descent. It's the one you see at air shows, right?

792
00:31:10,705 --> 00:31:14,670
(Level 3 consists of the basic flying, twists,)

793
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,940
(and a vertical descent from 457m high at 127km per hour.)

794
00:31:17,946 --> 00:31:20,310
It's Kwang Soo's turn now.

795
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:23,180
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo, you can do this.

796
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:25,225
- Good luck. - You're amazing.

797
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,890
To decide who will pay for the meal,

798
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:34,460
you'll play a game called The Last Room.

799
00:31:34,462 --> 00:31:36,330
- Okay. - "The Last Room"?

800
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:38,600
The rules are simple.

801
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,600
- There are 2 rooms downstairs. - 2 rooms.

802
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:45,145
You'll go downstairs one by one.

803
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:48,840
The names of the members in the room with less people...

804
00:31:48,843 --> 00:31:50,415
will go on the roulette wheel.

805
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,785
- What if it's 3 to 3? - Then nothing happens.

806
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,180
Let's start from Jong Kook.

807
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:57,325
- Okay. - Let's go.

808
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:59,680
(Winning this game will lower your chance of paying.)

809
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:01,680
- Let's go. - I'll talk to you by telepathy.

810
00:32:01,689 --> 00:32:02,835
Okay.

811
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:07,235
Go straight or turn left. A man should go straight.

812
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:10,930
A man should go straight.

813
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:12,230
(Jong Kook chooses the room at the end.)

814
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,230
(Which room will Han Na choose?)

815
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,445
Let's go.

816
00:32:18,606 --> 00:32:20,345
(Knocking)

817
00:32:21,276 --> 00:32:23,715
(Which room will Han Na choose?)

818
00:32:25,213 --> 00:32:26,585
(Opening)

819
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:30,310
What? No one is here.

820
00:32:30,318 --> 00:32:31,525
(Han Na chooses the first room.)

821
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:32,850
(It's 1 to 1 now.)

822
00:32:32,854 --> 00:32:33,850
Go.

823
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:35,265
(It's 1 to 1 now.)

824
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:38,020
(Which room will Jin Young choose?)

825
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,435
Well...

826
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:43,735
(The female Kim Jong Kook goes straight too.)

827
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,830
- Let me see. - Of course.

828
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,975
(Jin Young is here.)

829
00:32:48,803 --> 00:32:51,200
- We're two. - Hey.

830
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:52,345
Good.

831
00:32:53,007 --> 00:32:55,470
- We're two. We might win. - We might win.

832
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:56,685
See you later.

833
00:32:57,011 --> 00:33:00,110
Is it a good thing if we see each other? I'm not sure.

834
00:33:00,114 --> 00:33:02,895
You'll come to me.

835
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:06,320
Ji Hyo attracts me today. I'll come to you.

836
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,725
(Which room will Ji Hyo choose?)

837
00:33:10,058 --> 00:33:11,435
(Opening)

838
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,635
Yes.

839
00:33:14,195 --> 00:33:17,075
Good. It's done now.

840
00:33:17,532 --> 00:33:20,175
- You should always go straight. - It's done now.

841
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:21,230
We'll win.

842
00:33:21,236 --> 00:33:22,300
(The room at the end is safer now.)

843
00:33:22,303 --> 00:33:23,400
(Han Na is still alone.)

844
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,400
This is actually my room.

845
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:27,245
(Lonely)

846
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,385
Well... Let me see.

847
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,740
I should get ready to welcome a guest.

848
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:33,885
(I should calm down.)

849
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:40,465
(She even prepares flowers for the guest.)

850
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,795
- Next is Se Chan. Please go. - I'll see you later.

851
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,390
I should hurry.

852
00:33:45,393 --> 00:33:47,860
(Han Na's fate depends on Se Chan's choice.)

853
00:33:47,862 --> 00:33:53,500
(If Se Chan goes to Han Na's room, there's a chance for tied scores.)

854
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:59,200
(If Se Chan doesn't come, her name will be written on the roulette.)

855
00:33:59,207 --> 00:34:05,510
(Will Se Chan choose Han Na's room?)

856
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,255
(He flies away.)

857
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:11,350
(No, come back.)

858
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:12,350
(Opening)

859
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,925
Come on.

860
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,335
Why not?

861
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:19,260
Why did everyone go to that room? This is closer.

862
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,605
Wait, who's in the other room?

863
00:34:22,096 --> 00:34:25,405
(Only Haha remains.)

864
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,575
Why...

865
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:30,415
Why did everyone pass without thinking?

866
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:34,745
Why?

867
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,540
(He hesitates.)

868
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:41,980
(1 in the closer room, 4 in the farther room)

869
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:46,750
(Whether his name will be written on the roulette depends on his choice.)

870
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:49,390
He might come here.

871
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,420
(He survives if he chooses the room with more.)

872
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,460
(If he chooses the other, his name will be written on the roulette.)

873
00:34:53,461 --> 00:34:55,475
(Ringing)

874
00:34:55,863 --> 00:34:57,175
- You startled me. - My goodness.

875
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,700
(They startle each other.)

876
00:35:00,702 --> 00:35:03,715
- You startled me. - You really startled me.

877
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:05,615
I got so startled.

878
00:35:06,174 --> 00:35:07,440
I was so startled.

879
00:35:07,442 --> 00:35:10,270
(He chooses the wrong room, and his heart almost stops beating.)

880
00:35:10,278 --> 00:35:12,725
He really startled me.

881
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,785
Seriously.

882
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,510
- Why didn't you go in? - I heard the bell sound.

883
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,420
- Did you go in? - I thought there were many people.

884
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,780
He got tricked.

885
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:24,465
(The roulette is filled. Only payment remains.)

886
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:29,305
We'll calculate the cost for Heli-skiing and the restaurant.

887
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:31,630
- What's the current score? - Now...

888
00:35:31,632 --> 00:35:34,230
it's 2, 2, 2, and 1.

889
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,470
(Jong Kook, Han Na, Haha score 2, Se Chan and Jin Young score 1.)

890
00:35:36,471 --> 00:35:39,415
We'll select who will pay the cost for Heli-skiing.

891
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,970
- There's no practice. - No.

892
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,640
- Can we start without practice? - Of course.

893
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,010
- Let's go. - Is it one round?

894
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,340
- This is it. - Okay.

895
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,740
Only Jong Kook and I have debt.

896
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:48,910
- Right. - You startled me.

897
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,655
Please don't let it be me.

898
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,220
Spin.

899
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,325
1, 2, 3.

900
00:35:54,355 --> 00:35:57,020
(Who will pay the cost for Heli-skiing?)

901
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,290
It's done.

902
00:35:58,292 --> 00:35:59,705
- It's done. - Please.

903
00:35:59,727 --> 00:36:00,790
Haha!

904
00:36:00,795 --> 00:36:03,035
(Haha is selected.)

905
00:36:04,532 --> 00:36:07,905
(This must be a dream.)

906
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:09,900
(Everyone celebrates except Haha.)

907
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:14,485
I'm a coward

908
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,410
- It can't work with Haha. - Okay.

909
00:36:17,412 --> 00:36:18,685
(Haha pays 900 dollars.)

910
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:19,940
- How about this? - Spin it.

911
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,710
Next is the restaurant.

912
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,350
- It's the restaurant. - Haha spins it this time.

913
00:36:23,351 --> 00:36:24,625
- Shall Haha spin it? - Okay.

914
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,350
Let's go.

915
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:28,365
If you get selected again,

916
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,050
it'd be the best.

917
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:31,820
The cost won't be low.

918
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,020
Come on, Haha.

919
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:34,335
- This is expensive. - Let's go.

920
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,790
It's done.

921
00:36:36,798 --> 00:36:38,530
(Who will pay for the restaurant?)

922
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:39,875
It's spinning fast.

923
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,370
It's Han Na.

924
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:45,400
(Han Na is selected.)

925
00:36:45,406 --> 00:36:47,145
(She's surprised.)

926
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,340
It's Han Na.

927
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:52,510
- 1 is 1, it's not 2 - It's not 2

928
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:55,710
- 2 is 2, it's not 3 - 2 is 2, it's not 3

929
00:36:55,716 --> 00:36:57,180
(She pays 1,500 dollars.)

930
00:36:57,185 --> 00:37:00,380
Do you remember the rule I told you earlier?

931
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,225
To determine the debt,

932
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,890
there were three activities in Shuddering Package.

933
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:08,705
(A set of three activities for Shuddering Package)

934
00:37:09,197 --> 00:37:11,460
(For members who paid out of their own pocket,)

935
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:14,160
(there's a chance to get a refund.)

936
00:37:14,168 --> 00:37:18,400
(3 activities for Shuddering Package)

937
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:20,700
(If 1 of 3 activities is done,)

938
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:24,655
(the total expense will be reimbursed.)

939
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:27,655
Due to the circumstances and the weather,

940
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:31,010
the only available activity is the suspension bridge.

941
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,925
That's terrible.

942
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:36,935
(That's terrible.)

943
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:41,020
(Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is the longest suspension bridge.)

944
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:45,505
(Cross a bridge of 494m in length and 85m in height.)

945
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:47,360
If two of you...

946
00:37:47,368 --> 00:37:50,145
cross the suspension bridge,

947
00:37:50,571 --> 00:37:53,370
everyone will be exempted from paying debt.

948
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:54,845
We got it.

949
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:56,915
Do two members have to volunteer?

950
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:58,840
We have to decide.

951
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,825
- We have to pick two members. - Two members?

952
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:03,395
- They would sacrifice themselves. - Right.

953
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,925
I'll hand you a roulette.

954
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:10,535
The four of us should write down our names.

955
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:15,305
Spin the roulette once.

956
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,560
The person who is picked...

957
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,700
- He picks the second person? - selects another person.

958
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,730
That sounds good.

959
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:23,070
- It's fair. - Does he get to pick one?

960
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,515
- Picking is harder. - It's fair.

961
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:29,470
(Jong Kook, Se Chan, Haha, and Han Na)

962
00:38:29,477 --> 00:38:32,580
(They write their name on two pieces.)

963
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,210
Your fate depends on me.

964
00:38:36,217 --> 00:38:38,510
If your name gets picked,

965
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,090
- goodbye - Goodbye to suspension bridge

966
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,150
- Here I go. - If I get picked,

967
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,765
I want to go with Haha who is the worst coward.

968
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:51,260
That's why I want to be picked.

969
00:38:51,265 --> 00:38:55,245
I want to cross the bridge with Haha who's the worst coward.

970
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,940
As Han Na wishes, will Kang be picked?

971
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,700
Here I go. Spin it.

972
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,810
1, 2, 3, let's go.

973
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:04,870
It's spinning well.

974
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,840
1, 2, 3, let's go.

975
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:12,895
(The roulette of fate will determine who crosses the suspension bridge.)

976
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:16,290
(Which members will be selected?)

977
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,390
1, 2, 3, let's go.

978
00:39:18,392 --> 00:39:21,005
- It's spinning well. - That was a good spin.

979
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:26,400
(It's Kang Han Na.)

980
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,200
(Dreams come true.)

981
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:31,370
That's amazing.

982
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:32,945
(Am I also selected?)

983
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:35,670
If I'm crossing the bridge,

984
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,670
I'd like to go with Haha.

985
00:39:37,678 --> 00:39:41,080
I want to have a good time for the last time in Switzerland.

986
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:44,155
We'll take a jumping shot in the middle of the bridge.

987
00:39:45,886 --> 00:39:47,480
Make it clear, Han Na.

988
00:39:47,488 --> 00:39:48,580
Whom will you go with?

989
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,695
- Me? I'm going with Haha. - Okay.

990
00:39:53,894 --> 00:39:55,775
It's 6am.

991
00:39:56,297 --> 00:39:57,905
Good morning.

992
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,905
- "Good morning"? - I can't thank you enough.

993
00:40:01,669 --> 00:40:03,900
- Won't it be refreshing? - Yes.

994
00:40:03,904 --> 00:40:06,515
I prayed for a storm today.

995
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,470
- So the trip is canceled? - Yes.

996
00:40:09,477 --> 00:40:10,685
With all my heart,

997
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:12,780
I prayed hard.

998
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,840
(However, the weather is clear.)

999
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:15,585
I think the weather will be good.

1000
00:40:16,817 --> 00:40:18,650
(They arrive at Randa Station.)

1001
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:20,595
I haven't hiked in a while.

1002
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,850
(They even stretch.)

1003
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:23,995
It's a morning exercise.

1004
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,905
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1005
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,705
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1006
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:30,235
- Let's go and try it. - Let's go.

1007
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:33,005
- Everyone else does it. - Right.

1008
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,875
Why is he giving us hiking sticks?

1009
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:38,600
How hard will the hiking be?

1010
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:40,940
We aren't going to ski. Why do we need them?

1011
00:40:40,941 --> 00:40:43,985
(They're given hiking sticks.)

1012
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:46,985
I don't know how to use them. Should I just keep them?

1013
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:50,325
We might need them later. We'll find out.

1014
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,880
(They start hiking.)

1015
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,125
Does it take two hours?

1016
00:40:56,824 --> 00:40:59,120
It hasn't started yet,

1017
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:01,365
but we seem so serious already.

1018
00:41:02,263 --> 00:41:04,490
(They're flustered by the situation.)

1019
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:06,330
Goodness.

1020
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,530
Han Na thought that it'd be a trail.

1021
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:09,800
Look at her outfit.

1022
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,800
- This? - Look what she's wearing.

1023
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:14,285
Carrying a water bottle is inconvenient.

1024
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,970
This is why.

1025
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,740
My stylist said that we don't know what we're doing on the last day.

1026
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:22,280
We might go to the city near the airport.

1027
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:23,825
We have to go to the airport anyway.

1028
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:25,650
But we're hiking.

1029
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,020
It doesn't matter.

1030
00:41:27,021 --> 00:41:29,435
The stylist told me to wear it on the last day.
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

1031
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:32,935
The way is already beautiful.

1032
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,105
It is beautiful indeed.

1033
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,130
It's still beautiful.

1034
00:41:37,131 --> 00:41:38,905
- It's what I expected. - Really?

1035
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:41,405
It's a typical walk in Switzerland.

1036
00:41:41,535 --> 00:41:43,175
This is easy.

1037
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:46,640
Han Na is definitely different...

1038
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,845
from So Min.

1039
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,785
However, you're similar in a way.

1040
00:41:51,412 --> 00:41:54,285
- No, we're completely different. - Of course.

1041
00:41:54,482 --> 00:41:58,125
When I'm with So Min, I stand out less.

1042
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,020
(They see a cute trampoline.)

1043
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,050
Look.

1044
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:04,035
It's a trampoline that we paid 50 cents to use when we were young.

1045
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:07,035
It's a big trampoline for a house.

1046
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:09,660
I had a small one at home.

1047
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:11,260
I'd play there all day.

1048
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:13,305
She never stops talking.

1049
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:15,230
- Seriously. - Who?

1050
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,415
You.

1051
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:19,100
- Are you tired? - No.

1052
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:20,970
So Min is also talkative,

1053
00:42:20,975 --> 00:42:22,170
but you're different.

1054
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:25,740
So Min and I went to Hong Kong together.

1055
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:28,840
She talked nonstop.

1056
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:30,380
That's what you're doing now.

1057
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,765
(He explodes.)

1058
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:34,720
(She pretends not to be.)

1059
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:35,790
I'm sorry.

1060
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,365
- Are you angry? - No.

1061
00:42:38,893 --> 00:42:40,090
It's pretty.

1062
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:43,590
(They pass a small and cute village.)

1063
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:45,105
It's so beautiful.

1064
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,430
(It's silence after a long time.)

1065
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,415
Are you looking down for snakes?

1066
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:52,215
Look at the view.

1067
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:53,800
It's so beautiful.

1068
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:55,370
(He walks with talkative Han Na.)

1069
00:42:55,376 --> 00:42:58,440
(They charge forward to the suspension bridge.)

1070
00:42:58,445 --> 00:42:59,710
This is great.

1071
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:01,110
(The air is very fresh.)

1072
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,310
It's amazing.

1073
00:43:02,316 --> 00:43:04,010
This air can't be bought.

1074
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,525
This is what luxury is about.

1075
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:07,965
It's amazing.

1076
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:12,620
(They find something.)

1077
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:13,920
Look at them.

1078
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:15,935
- We finally see them. - Don't startle them.

1079
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,600
(They finally see Valais Blacknose.)

1080
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,160
(Han Na runs into what she wanted to see in Switzerland.)

1081
00:43:22,169 --> 00:43:23,415
This is amazing.

1082
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:24,945
They're hard to be so close to them.

1083
00:43:25,806 --> 00:43:27,115
Hello.

1084
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,370
They're so cute. They're like dolls.

1085
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,440
I was born in the year of sheep.

1086
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:31,440
(They're from a region called Valais.)

1087
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:32,825
They're just like dolls.

1088
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:36,110
(She stops for the sheep.)

1089
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,825
(Who am I? Where am I?)

1090
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:39,425
Hello.

1091
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:42,125
Ji Hyo would have loved to see them.

1092
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:44,820
It's dangerous here.

1093
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:47,420
(Thanks to the clean air and the view, they don't get tired.)

1094
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:48,905
It's so nice here.

1095
00:43:49,196 --> 00:43:50,660
How much would this air be worth?

1096
00:43:50,664 --> 00:43:52,305
(The air is so precious.)

1097
00:43:53,033 --> 00:43:56,845
Before I came here, I blamed Han Na.

1098
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,215
But I'm thankful now.

1099
00:43:58,339 --> 00:43:59,670
- It's nice, right? - With our sticks...

1100
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:00,815
(They're happy to be here.)

1101
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,040
- Seriously... - This is so nice.

1102
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,515
It smells like poop.

1103
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:08,285
- But I even like that. - Please say it in a nicer way.

1104
00:44:08,816 --> 00:44:11,980
I'm so happy I was chosen.

1105
00:44:11,986 --> 00:44:14,620
The roulette chose me.

1106
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:16,265
(The road is nice, and the view is beautiful.)

1107
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:18,095
- You have to take this path. - That path?

1108
00:44:18,993 --> 00:44:19,990
(According to the sign...)

1109
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:21,490
- No way. - That path?

1110
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:23,205
- That's not our path. - The path begins here.

1111
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,835
It can't be.

1112
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:27,475
- This... - It's right here.

1113
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,600
- But... - This...

1114
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:32,215
- No, it's not our path. - Will it get better later?

1115
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,015
Or will it be like this all the way?

1116
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,885
We have to walk on this path for two hours?

1117
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:38,115
- About an hour and a half. - No way.

1118
00:44:38,145 --> 00:44:40,080
I don't believe it. I'm already tired.

1119
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,825
Tell them your ankles hurt.

1120
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:43,655
Let's call it a day.

1121
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:47,050
I couldn't abandon my colleague.

1122
00:44:47,054 --> 00:44:51,250
We even saw the sheep on the way.

1123
00:44:51,258 --> 00:44:52,820
We've seen enough.

1124
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:55,305
- We've filmed enough, right? - Right?

1125
00:44:55,629 --> 00:44:58,430
(They still have to film some more.)

1126
00:44:58,432 --> 00:44:59,705
Let's go.

1127
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,560
This path is so narrow.

1128
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,175
(Serious)

1129
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:06,685
Our survival starts now.

1130
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,140
- Yes. - Let's focus on surviving.

1131
00:45:09,143 --> 00:45:10,315
(Focused)

1132
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:11,970
Haha, look at this.

1133
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:15,040
- Just go on. - Haha, look at this.

1134
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,310
Isn't that an acorn shell?

1135
00:45:16,317 --> 00:45:18,955
You just said we should focus on surviving.

1136
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,750
- I mean... - Just keep going.

1137
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:22,250
- It's just... - My goodness.

1138
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:24,335
- You're driving me crazy. - I mean...

1139
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:27,665
I saw acorn shells. Are they pine nuts?

1140
00:45:29,063 --> 00:45:31,475
- Be careful. - We should really be careful.

1141
00:45:31,832 --> 00:45:33,030
This is survival.

1142
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:34,130
(Serious)

1143
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:35,430
- Haha. - Just go.

1144
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:38,430
You have to film it. It's a slug.

1145
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,015
- What's that? - Look.

1146
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,615
Is it gross? Please film it.

1147
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:45,440
- What's that? - I've never seen it before.

1148
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:47,055
- You call that a slug? - It has no shell.

1149
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:51,225
Gosh. This is... Switzerland... Mother Nature...

1150
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,820
(What is she saying?)

1151
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,520
I don't know what to say.

1152
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:57,565
Now that we've filmed a slug, let's go on.

1153
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:00,805
(After 10 minutes)

1154
00:46:01,795 --> 00:46:02,860
There's an observatory.

1155
00:46:02,863 --> 00:46:04,505
- Okay. - Okay.

1156
00:46:04,965 --> 00:46:06,200
We're here.

1157
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,530
(They stop by at the observatory.)

1158
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:08,845
Look.

1159
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:10,670
(This is incredible.)

1160
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:11,975
We're here.

1161
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:14,740
(They're awed by Mother Nature.)

1162
00:46:14,742 --> 00:46:15,900
We're here!

1163
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,370
(They're awed by Mother Nature.)

1164
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:19,185
This place is so sacred.

1165
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,385
It's a cliff?

1166
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:23,850
Be careful.

1167
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,655
(If you take a few more steps...)

1168
00:46:26,787 --> 00:46:29,365
It's incredible. Look at that.

1169
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:33,790
(It's not computer graphics.)

1170
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,505
The air is so clean.

1171
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,590
(The trail is full of...)

1172
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:39,975
(beautiful surprises.)

1173
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,770
- This whole place is beautiful. - I feel bad.

1174
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,170
I don't want to walk on it.

1175
00:46:45,172 --> 00:46:46,485
It's so beautiful.

1176
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:49,485
(They stop for a moment.)

1177
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:57,010
(They're playing music with their phone.)

1178
00:46:57,017 --> 00:47:00,365
- Haha is crying. - This is...

1179
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:03,835
- so moving. - It is.

1180
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:07,365
(They're not tired anymore.)

1181
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,490
- I got goosebumps. - Me too.

1182
00:47:10,497 --> 00:47:12,860
- We got goosebumps. - At the same time.

1183
00:47:12,866 --> 00:47:14,800
- Please take a close up. - It's so beautiful.

1184
00:47:14,802 --> 00:47:17,200
(The cameramen's first close-up of goosebumps)

1185
00:47:17,204 --> 00:47:19,115
I still have goosebumps.

1186
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:21,545
I'm speechless.

1187
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:24,985
(They're eating jelly.)

1188
00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:26,985
That's crazy.

1189
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,325
- I saw it. - What did you see?

1190
00:47:29,983 --> 00:47:31,950
Hold on.

1191
00:47:31,952 --> 00:47:33,825
I'm not thankful anymore.

1192
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:37,850
(While walking through the nature,)

1193
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:40,560
(they see something ahead of them.)

1194
00:47:40,561 --> 00:47:42,060
(This is it.)

1195
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,930
We can't do this.

1196
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:47,005
- What is this? - This is impossible.

1197
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:49,570
We can't do it.

1198
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,575
(Charles Kuonen Suspension Bridge is 494m long and 85m high.)

1199
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,285
- I got goosebumps. - Gosh.

1200
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:57,855
We can't do this. We just can't.

1201
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:01,810
Forget about Mother Nature. This is ridiculous.

1202
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:04,110
Why would you have this in the middle of nature?

1203
00:48:04,118 --> 00:48:06,350
Why... We can't do this.

1204
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:08,880
- I got goosebumps. - Come on.

1205
00:48:08,889 --> 00:48:10,020
(What will they do?)

1206
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:12,490
It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1207
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,220
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1208
00:48:14,228 --> 00:48:16,020
- You can do this. - Be careful.

1209
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,060
You're amazing.

1210
00:48:17,064 --> 00:48:19,530
- Let's sing for him. - Sure.

1211
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:23,045
- You were born to be penalized - You were born to be penalized

1212
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:30,310
(You were born to be penalized, Kwang Soo)

1213
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:34,325
(Even in the UK, you are destined to be penalized)

1214
00:48:34,948 --> 00:48:37,355
(I appreciate it.)

1215
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:41,665
(You were also born to go to the ghost castle)

1216
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:43,720
(Sighing)

1217
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:45,665
Stop it.

1218
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:49,505
(What are you doing?)

1219
00:48:49,563 --> 00:48:51,030
(You should take a picture before being penalized.)

1220
00:48:51,031 --> 00:48:52,660
We should take a picture.

1221
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:55,430
- That's enough. - He looks funny.

1222
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:59,130
Seok Jin is bad at reading others' feelings.

1223
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,940
(Did you see that?)

1224
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,670
I've known him for more than 20 years,

1225
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:06,425
and he's really bad at reading others' emotions.

1226
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:08,485
Don't worry.

1227
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:10,995
You just have to sit there.

1228
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:12,755
Drink some water.

1229
00:49:13,654 --> 00:49:15,150
This is today's Hayashi rice.

1230
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:16,565
Hayashi rice?

1231
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,960
(Hayashi rice)

1232
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,890
That's a dish.

1233
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:23,705
"My bladder will burst."

1234
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,975
- Let's get it. - He said, "My bladder will burst."

1235
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:29,000
(My bladder will burst.)

1236
00:49:29,002 --> 00:49:31,115
(Did you mean, "We've been cracking up a lot"?)

1237
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:33,600
(This is today's Hayashi rice.)

1238
00:49:33,607 --> 00:49:36,140
(Seok Jin keeps saying wrong words.)

1239
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,885
- Think before you say something. - I'm jet-lagged.

1240
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,410
- Why... - "Hayashi rice".

1241
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,540
- Why can't you keep quiet? - You can do this.

1242
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,555
It's finally Kwang Soo's turn.

1243
00:49:44,585 --> 00:49:47,795
Today's highlight is Kwang Soo.

1244
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:50,350
- All ready? - Yes.

1245
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:51,820
You can do this! You're the best.

1246
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:55,020
(This is it.)

1247
00:49:55,028 --> 00:49:57,930
All right. I'm in trouble.

1248
00:49:57,931 --> 00:49:58,960
(He's been watching in fear.)

1249
00:49:58,966 --> 00:50:01,075
Gosh, it's driving me crazy.

1250
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,030
(Kwang Soo gets on the airplane.)

1251
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:08,140
Your right hand on the handle here,

1252
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,140
and your left hand there.

1253
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,185
Kwang Soo can't close his mouth.

1254
00:50:12,446 --> 00:50:15,325
He's a coward just like me.

1255
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:18,455
- Okay. - There you go.

1256
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,620
And then be careful. Are you okay?

1257
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,050
(He carefully moves his foot.)

1258
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:25,995
- Here? Should I hold here? - Yes. Okay.

1259
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:28,090
Hold on.

1260
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:29,665
You'll be fine.

1261
00:50:30,297 --> 00:50:32,230
It's scary when you go up there.

1262
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:33,630
- It is? - Yes.

1263
00:50:33,634 --> 00:50:36,275
- He must be nervous. - It's scary just to be up there.

1264
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,740
(He manages to sit on the chair.)

1265
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,385
The chair is too small.

1266
00:50:43,577 --> 00:50:45,440
(We thought everything was fine.)

1267
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:47,055
The chair is too small.

1268
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:49,110
- What was that? - The chair is too small.

1269
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:51,850
- The chair is too small. - Too small?

1270
00:50:51,852 --> 00:50:53,350
No, it's not. It's fine.

1271
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:54,420
(Determined)

1272
00:50:54,421 --> 00:50:55,895
You'll be okay.

1273
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:57,795
What is he doing?

1274
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,550
He sat on the chair.

1275
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,660
Kwang Soo, it'll be fine.

1276
00:51:02,663 --> 00:51:04,430
Smile. Say hi.

1277
00:51:04,431 --> 00:51:05,530
Hi.

1278
00:51:05,532 --> 00:51:06,530
(He does as she says.)

1279
00:51:06,533 --> 00:51:09,060
Remember, if you want to come down,

1280
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,670
put thumbs down, and the pilot will land as soon as he can.

1281
00:51:12,673 --> 00:51:14,445
I'll come and take you when you're done.

1282
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:17,610
The pilot put his helmet on.

1283
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:18,910
Look at that.

1284
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,610
What's going on?

1285
00:51:20,614 --> 00:51:23,180
(The UK, wing-walking, level 3... What is going on?)

1286
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:25,680
This must be a dream.

1287
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:27,265
What is...

1288
00:51:27,854 --> 00:51:29,520
(Everything is set.)

1289
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:34,105
(The engine starts.)

1290
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:36,390
- It's moving. - It's moving.

1291
00:51:36,396 --> 00:51:37,960
(The airplane is moving.)

1292
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:40,245
See you!

1293
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:43,175
(Rummaging)

1294
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,245
(He takes something out of his pocket.)

1295
00:51:47,808 --> 00:51:50,570
- It's a relaxing pill. - That's awesome.

1296
00:51:50,577 --> 00:51:52,670
(Sang Yeob gave a relaxing pill to Kwang Soo.)

1297
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,955
Did you bring it in case you go wing-walking?

1298
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:58,955
(Thanks, Sang Yeob.)

1299
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:02,350
(The airplane starts to move as soon as he takes the pill.)

1300
00:52:02,356 --> 00:52:03,635
It's moving.

1301
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:08,890
(He can't say anything.)

1302
00:52:08,895 --> 00:52:11,790
Kwang Soo is shaking.

1303
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:13,730
What will happen to him?

1304
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:16,105
(Shaking)

1305
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:18,800
Once it turns, it'll take off.

1306
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:21,285
It'll take off soon.

1307
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:25,210
(It's time to take off.)

1308
00:52:25,212 --> 00:52:26,610
How did you feel right before the takeoff?

1309
00:52:26,613 --> 00:52:29,280
- I felt scared. - It's scary, right?

1310
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:30,510
- Right? - It was scary.

1311
00:52:30,517 --> 00:52:31,980
- I was scared too. - You were?

1312
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,580
- I was scared. - Right before the takeoff?

1313
00:52:33,587 --> 00:52:36,450
With the earplugs, you don't hear anything.

1314
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:39,420
(Description service)

1315
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:41,660
You realize that you're alone.

1316
00:52:41,661 --> 00:52:46,275
The sound of the propeller gets louder and louder.

1317
00:52:46,466 --> 00:52:49,575
Just when you wonder when the airplane will take off,

1318
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,315
everything starts.

1319
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,015
(That moment is here.)

1320
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:56,270
(Just when you wonder,)

1321
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,110
(it takes off.)

1322
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,210
It's taking off.

1323
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:02,385
I'm flying.

1324
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:06,325
(The airplane flies up at great speed.)

1325
00:53:07,053 --> 00:53:08,850
- He's going up. - It took off.

1326
00:53:08,855 --> 00:53:10,750
- How do you feel at this moment? - My goodness.

1327
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,705
Like I said, you feel bad the whole time.

1328
00:53:14,594 --> 00:53:17,305
(Screaming)

1329
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:19,575
(Bad mood)

1330
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:22,975
Cowards never let go of the handles.

1331
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,345
We hold onto them.

1332
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:29,215
(He is holding onto the handle firmly.)

1333
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:32,315
(He hasn't taken his hands off even for a second.)

1334
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:35,040
(The airplane is high up.)

1335
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,895
You start to ask yourself,

1336
00:53:37,117 --> 00:53:38,855
"Should I put my thumbs down and go down?"

1337
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:40,350
- This? - Like this?

1338
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:42,780
Between the show and yourself,

1339
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,195
that's where the inner conflict begins.

1340
00:53:44,624 --> 00:53:46,220
(The twist starts...)

1341
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:48,605
(before he has time for an inner conflict.)

1342
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:53,345
(His lips twist in a funny way.)

1343
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:56,375
It looks like his body is slanted.

1344
00:53:57,304 --> 00:53:59,745
(He's almost lying down.)

1345
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,815
(The anti-anxiety medicine spills out due to the intense twist.)

1346
00:54:02,943 --> 00:54:04,970
This is much higher than before.

1347
00:54:04,978 --> 00:54:07,825
- I think he's going to drop soon. - Will he?

1348
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:08,940
(The vertical descent...)

1349
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,555
(has started.)

1350
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,620
(Hold on.)

1351
00:54:15,622 --> 00:54:18,065
(What's this?)

1352
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:20,320
(This is the highlight of level 3.)

1353
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:24,705
(The vertical descent starts.)

1354
00:54:25,966 --> 00:54:29,905
(The plane accelerates towards the ground at a steep angle.)

1355
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,300
I'm scared.

1356
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:33,785
(He can't even scream.)

1357
00:54:34,641 --> 00:54:36,440
- Kwang Soo. - It's high.

1358
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:39,555
(They're shocked by how different this is from level 1 and 2.)

1359
00:54:41,147 --> 00:54:42,910
(Before the shock subsides,)

1360
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:45,910
(here comes the 2nd vertical descent.)

1361
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:47,720
- It's scary. - Gosh, what now?

1362
00:54:47,721 --> 00:54:51,865
(At this angle, the plane is so close to the ground.)

1363
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,365
It's scary.

1364
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:57,275
(He's about to faint.)

1365
00:54:58,331 --> 00:54:59,935
He's holding on tightly.

1366
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:02,975
(This is the 3rd consecutive vertical descent.)

1367
00:55:04,271 --> 00:55:06,200
Kwang Soo.

1368
00:55:06,206 --> 00:55:08,215
- What should we do? - Gosh, Kwang Soo.

1369
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:11,140
It was completely vertical.

1370
00:55:11,144 --> 00:55:12,710
- He went so far. - Where did he go?

1371
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:14,680
He went really far. He disappeared.

1372
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:17,125
- He's over there. - Did he go home?

1373
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:18,950
- Did he go to Korea? - He went so far.

1374
00:55:18,952 --> 00:55:21,020
He's going straight to Korea.

1375
00:55:21,021 --> 00:55:22,165
(That's possible.)

1376
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,765
- He's going to Incheon Airport. - He'll be hanging like that.

1377
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,690
(This vertical descent...)

1378
00:55:26,693 --> 00:55:30,075
(goes straight to Korea.)

1379
00:55:31,031 --> 00:55:34,245
(We won't see you off, Kwang Soo.)

1380
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:40,485
(Please take me home.)

1381
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:44,870
- This is on a different level. - This is much higher.

1382
00:55:44,878 --> 00:55:46,910
- This is endless. - I think he'll come down now.

1383
00:55:46,913 --> 00:55:50,825
He should. He has to live.

1384
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:53,950
- He's coming down. - You feel a relief.

1385
00:55:53,954 --> 00:55:55,865
- "This is over." - Right.

1386
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,920
(He lands safely.)

1387
00:55:58,925 --> 00:56:00,720
Kwang Soo did a good job.

1388
00:56:00,727 --> 00:56:01,720
(He's wrecked.)

1389
00:56:01,728 --> 00:56:04,875
- He did a good job. - Good job, Kwang Soo.

1390
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:07,230
That was great. He did an excellent job.

1391
00:56:07,233 --> 00:56:09,560
- I think he's crying. - He's almost...

1392
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:10,800
fixed to the chair.

1393
00:56:10,804 --> 00:56:11,945
(Is he fixed to the chair?)

1394
00:56:12,405 --> 00:56:15,685
- He's stuck to it. - What is wrong with him?

1395
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:18,485
You're a true coward.

1396
00:56:18,612 --> 00:56:20,910
- His lips are blue. - His lips are not together.

1397
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:22,725
He lost consciousness.

1398
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:26,580
(The employee comes to help him get down.)

1399
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:27,950
Is everything all right?

1400
00:56:27,954 --> 00:56:29,320
- Okay. - Are you okay?

1401
00:56:29,322 --> 00:56:31,765
(Is everything all right?)

1402
00:56:32,325 --> 00:56:36,875
(Is something wrong with him?)

1403
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:40,975
(He's covered in the anti-anxiety medicine.)

1404
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:44,030
(He thought it might be helpful,)

1405
00:56:44,037 --> 00:56:47,185
(so he took it right before departing.)

1406
00:56:47,474 --> 00:56:50,655
(He spit it all out.)

1407
00:56:52,445 --> 00:56:54,110
Can we please have some tissues?

1408
00:56:54,114 --> 00:56:56,180
(There's brown fluid.)

1409
00:56:56,182 --> 00:56:58,310
- Tissues. She wants some tissues. - Really?

1410
00:56:58,318 --> 00:56:59,695
Tissues?

1411
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,180
Kwang Soo, good job.

1412
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:03,180
(Coward Kwang Soo did it.)

1413
00:57:03,189 --> 00:57:06,595
- I'm so proud of you. - Good job. I'm proud of you.

1414
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:09,035
Thank you.

1415
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:10,390
(You're welcome.)

1416
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:11,605
Thank you.

1417
00:57:11,698 --> 00:57:13,830
(He also gives a salute.)

1418
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,805
Thank you.

1419
00:57:16,036 --> 00:57:17,730
- Very well done. - Thank you. Thank you so much.

1420
00:57:17,737 --> 00:57:19,970
I have a sword, so I'm going to knight you now.

1421
00:57:19,973 --> 00:57:22,670
(I praise you in the name of twists, vertical descent, and wing walking.)

1422
00:57:22,676 --> 00:57:25,240
Look at the captain.

1423
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:26,680
The vertical descent was incredible.

1424
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,510
What's on your face?

1425
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:31,010
Why is your saliva that color? Is that the relaxing pill?

1426
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:32,480
Is that poop?

1427
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:34,220
(Could it be?)

1428
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,380
- There's poop around your mouth. - Did you puke?

1429
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:39,135
- It's anti-anxiety medicine. - It came out.

1430
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:41,520
You should have taken it earlier, not just before.

1431
00:57:41,528 --> 00:57:43,390
The medicine spilled out.

1432
00:57:43,396 --> 00:57:45,090
You should have had it earlier.

1433
00:57:45,098 --> 00:57:46,860
How can you poop through your mouth?

1434
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:49,960
I told you to take it 30 minutes before.

1435
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:52,200
- Kwang Soo. - I departed before I swallowed it.

1436
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:53,645
(I should have done that.)

1437
00:57:54,407 --> 00:57:56,345
- Can you give him some wet wipes? - Goodness.

1438
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,410
When I was going down,

1439
00:57:58,411 --> 00:57:59,940
- That was awesome. - I wanted to spread my arms,

1440
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:02,110
but I couldn't let go.

1441
00:58:02,115 --> 00:58:05,080
- I'm serious. - How was it?

1442
00:58:05,085 --> 00:58:07,750
- Wasn't it scary? - It was so scary.

1443
00:58:07,754 --> 00:58:10,765
He's lying. He was on a sailboat.

1444
00:58:11,091 --> 00:58:14,235
That wasn't it. It was so scary.

1445
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:16,930
The medicine I took came out from my eyes.

1446
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,430
(He was that scared.)

1447
00:58:19,432 --> 00:58:21,675
- I'm serious. - Hey.

1448
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,300
- There was brown water in my eyes. - Hey.

1449
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:26,940
- It came out from my eyes. - Kwang Soo,

1450
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,470
- when were you most scared? - It was going down,

1451
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:32,055
and I couldn't spread my arms. That was the scariest.

1452
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:33,410
I couldn't let go.

1453
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:35,155
(You were supposed to let go.)

1454
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:36,210
(He was screaming.)

1455
00:58:36,216 --> 00:58:40,425
I did this with my fingers.

1456
00:58:41,187 --> 00:58:42,380
He couldn't see.

1457
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:46,020
The wing walking penalty has been completed.

1458
00:58:46,025 --> 00:58:47,520
(They have completed their mission.)

1459
00:58:47,527 --> 00:58:50,735
- Good job. - You were awesome.

1460
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:53,730
- Great job. - Let's not get the penalty again.

1461
00:58:53,733 --> 00:58:54,805
- We didn't do anything wrong. - Oh, gosh.

1462
00:58:55,268 --> 00:58:57,930
Everybody, congratulations. The only thing left is...

1463
00:58:57,937 --> 00:59:00,400
a night at the haunted castle.

1464
00:59:00,406 --> 00:59:01,545
(It's not over yet. Next penalty is staying at a haunted castle.)

1465
00:59:02,175 --> 00:59:07,155
(They must spend a night in Oxford Castle where spirits appear.)

1466
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:13,286
Everybody, congratulations. The only thing left is...

1467
00:59:13,286 --> 00:59:15,755
a night at the haunted castle.

1468
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:16,890
(It's not over yet. Next penalty is staying at a haunted castle.)

1469
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:22,495
(They must spend a night in Oxford Castle where spirits appear.)

1470
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,933
Why would we sleep there? They already went through enough.

1471
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:29,035
So Min.

1472
00:59:29,169 --> 00:59:31,404
Would you like to stay for a night, Seok Jin?

1473
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:33,606
The new mission has to be fair.

1474
00:59:33,606 --> 00:59:35,642
(He's adamant.)

1475
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:36,643
Seok Jin.

1476
00:59:36,643 --> 00:59:38,912
(It has to be fair.)

1477
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:42,248
Before going there for the night,

1478
00:59:42,248 --> 00:59:45,351
we prepared the best dishes in the UK.

1479
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:47,020
(Dinner is on the staff for completing wing walking.)

1480
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,189
You can head there together.

1481
00:59:49,322 --> 00:59:52,625
- We finished one penalty. - Right.

1482
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:55,728
That's right. Great job. 1, 2, 3.

1483
00:59:55,728 --> 00:59:58,164
- Great job. - Great job. You were awesome.

1484
00:59:58,464 --> 01:00:01,100
Great job.

1485
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,002
- Good job. - The food is coming.

1486
01:00:03,102 --> 01:00:05,471
Can people not go there freely?

1487
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:07,774
I thought this was sliced radish.

1488
01:00:09,943 --> 01:00:12,212
- The shrimp looks so good. - Thank you.

1489
01:00:12,212 --> 01:00:13,613
(It's dried jamon and shrimp with homemade sauce.)

1490
01:00:13,613 --> 01:00:14,814
It's jamon.

1491
01:00:14,814 --> 01:00:16,749
(It's dried jamon and shrimp with homemade sauce.)

1492
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:17,917
What's this called?

1493
01:00:17,917 --> 01:00:19,052
(He takes a bite.)

1494
01:00:19,252 --> 01:00:21,387
(This is good.)

1495
01:00:21,387 --> 01:00:22,655
It's good.

1496
01:00:23,656 --> 01:00:26,426
You worked hard, so we're providing you with this.

1497
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:29,028
- Thank you so much. - Thank you.

1498
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:30,396
There's something else.

1499
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:33,299
(Shrimp and jamon were appetizers.)

1500
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,901
- It's steak. - Steak?

1501
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:37,303
- That looks good. - That does.

1502
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:39,973
You'll be sleeping at the haunted castle.

1503
01:00:40,607 --> 01:00:42,475
- How do we decide who goes? - That sounds so scary.

1504
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:45,712
We're going to play a game in there and decide.

1505
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:48,448
- In there? - I'm sorry for asking,

1506
01:00:48,715 --> 01:00:51,718
but how many games are we playing?

1507
01:00:51,718 --> 01:00:53,820
We're like game addicts.

1508
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,188
We're all professional gamers.

1509
01:00:55,188 --> 01:00:58,725
You have to keep your promise with the viewers and sleep there.

1510
01:00:58,725 --> 01:01:00,827
(It doesn't matter who it is.)

1511
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:03,897
That's right. We have to keep our promise with the viewers.

1512
01:01:03,897 --> 01:01:04,931
Then...

1513
01:01:04,931 --> 01:01:06,299
(Okay, then.)

1514
01:01:06,299 --> 01:01:09,702
- For Seok Jin. - For Seok Jin.

1515
01:01:09,702 --> 01:01:12,906
(Cheers)

1516
01:01:12,906 --> 01:01:15,541
No. It's not me today.

1517
01:01:16,242 --> 01:01:17,377
Don't do that.

1518
01:01:17,377 --> 01:01:20,213
- For Seok Jin's good sleep. - For Seok Jin's good sleep.

1519
01:01:20,914 --> 01:01:24,817
It's not me. Don't do that. Be careful what you for.

1520
01:01:24,817 --> 01:01:27,887
(He can't speak properly.)

1521
01:01:27,887 --> 01:01:29,088
(Spitting)

1522
01:01:29,088 --> 01:01:30,089
(Seok Jin has started again.)

1523
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:31,424
What did he say?

1524
01:01:31,424 --> 01:01:34,294
- He mumbled the words. - What did he say?

1525
01:01:34,294 --> 01:01:36,529
He tried to say, "Be careful what you ask for."

1526
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:37,897
What was that?

1527
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:40,233
- What was that again? - Oh, gosh.

1528
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:42,335
The jet lag is driving me nuts.

1529
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:43,970
(Who will get to spend the last night in the haunted castle?)

1530
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:45,638
I can't say things properly.

1531
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:48,174
Why did Mother Nature create this?

1532
01:01:48,174 --> 01:01:50,410
Why? How are we supposed to do this?

1533
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,179
- I got goosebumps again. - Oh, gosh.

1534
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:57,350
Oh, gosh. I'm so mad.

1535
01:01:57,517 --> 01:02:00,320
I just had jelly, and I feel like I'm going to throw it up.

1536
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,788
This is insane.

1537
01:02:01,788 --> 01:02:04,724
It's so long. It gives me goosebumps just by looking at it.

1538
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:07,927
It moves so much. Look, Haha. Just look.

1539
01:02:08,528 --> 01:02:10,430
The whole bridge is dancing.

1540
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:12,699
You know why I feel slightly better?

1541
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:15,101
- Why? - I'm not crossing that bridge.

1542
01:02:15,601 --> 01:02:18,705
- Why? - I feel okay. I gave up.

1543
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:20,640
I feel calmer after giving up.

1544
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,775
- Are you going to pay? - Yes.

1545
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:26,279
What is this about?

1546
01:02:26,279 --> 01:02:28,047
- Are you going to pay? - Yes.

1547
01:02:28,047 --> 01:02:29,148
(He'd rather pay and starve than cross that bridge.)

1548
01:02:29,148 --> 01:02:32,051
No, join me. I can't cross it by myself.

1549
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:34,320
- That... - Wait.

1550
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,389
- I can't even look. - How can you cross that?

1551
01:02:37,023 --> 01:02:38,691
There are holes.

1552
01:02:38,691 --> 01:02:40,560
On the floor? Stop lying.

1553
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:41,961
Look.

1554
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:43,696
I can't even look.

1555
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:45,598
Let's go. I'm not scared.

1556
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:47,000
- You're not? - No.

1557
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,501
I'm not crossing it.

1558
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:49,902
(I'm not going to cross it anyway.)

1559
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:53,106
I'm not afraid anymore. I'm not crossing it.

1560
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,474
I can't cross this.

1561
01:02:54,774 --> 01:02:57,377
Can the camera show how terrifying this is?

1562
01:02:57,377 --> 01:02:59,812
Are you going to pay money and give up...

1563
01:02:59,812 --> 01:03:01,848
or cross the bridge? Please decide.

1564
01:03:02,315 --> 01:03:03,583
They're telling me to do this.

1565
01:03:04,217 --> 01:03:07,286
Haha, are you going to pay... How much is it exactly?

1566
01:03:07,353 --> 01:03:09,288
I want to hear it and think about it.

1567
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:13,026
If you think about it, we had such a good tour of Switzerland.

1568
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:14,827
I don't feel bad about paying. Do you?

1569
01:03:16,829 --> 01:03:19,866
(They're scared to cross it but also don't want to miss the chance.)

1570
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:22,301
Hold on. It gives me goosebumps just looking.

1571
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:25,204
According to our staff, it's doable.

1572
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:27,473
The weather is nice, and it's not windy.

1573
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,075
It's the perfect condition for crossing.

1574
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,544
(Hesitating)

1575
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:33,079
- Haha, let's do this. - Let's go.

1576
01:03:33,079 --> 01:03:34,947
(Haha, let's do this.)

1577
01:03:35,048 --> 01:03:36,883
Let's do this. We're already in Switzerland.

1578
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:38,785
We came all the way up here. Let's do this.

1579
01:03:39,352 --> 01:03:41,654
(Let's see.)

1580
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:43,623
- Okay, let's do this. - I think...

1581
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:47,193
the drama I'm shooting right now will be a success.

1582
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:49,395
Viewers, thank you for your interest.

1583
01:03:49,395 --> 01:03:51,230
(She promotes her drama while deciding to cross the bridge.)

1584
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,332
Good. Let's go.

1585
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:54,567
(Let's do this. Let's cross it.)

1586
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,635
I'm here, so I should do it.

1587
01:03:55,635 --> 01:03:56,836
(He's scared.)

1588
01:03:57,203 --> 01:03:58,671
It's shaking.

1589
01:03:58,671 --> 01:04:01,107
(The starting point of this 494m long bridge)

1590
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:04,811
(Han Na starts first.)

1591
01:04:05,912 --> 01:04:08,581
(Shaking)

1592
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:09,882
Haha.

1593
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,284
It's shaking.

1594
01:04:11,818 --> 01:04:15,488
Gosh, why is this shaking so much? Hold on.

1595
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,457
There's a person in front of me.

1596
01:04:17,457 --> 01:04:20,093
(Because the cameraman is in front of you.)

1597
01:04:20,893 --> 01:04:23,529
- Haha, it's shaking so much. - Don't do that.

1598
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:26,332
It's shaking so much. Stop shaking it.

1599
01:04:27,133 --> 01:04:28,568
It's shaking so much.

1600
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:31,471
What do I do? What do I do?

1601
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:33,339
Hold on.

1602
01:04:33,339 --> 01:04:34,440
(She stands awkwardly.)

1603
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,310
Hold on.

1604
01:04:37,310 --> 01:04:40,613
This is shaking so much.

1605
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:43,883
- Why is this shaking so much? - I... Wait.

1606
01:04:44,117 --> 01:04:45,885
What's this? Don't look down.

1607
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:47,887
Don't look down.

1608
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,856
(You can see the bottom.)

1609
01:04:49,856 --> 01:04:51,157
I can't.

1610
01:04:51,757 --> 01:04:53,826
(Should I go or not?)

1611
01:04:54,227 --> 01:04:55,962
(He gets up.)

1612
01:04:56,729 --> 01:04:58,764
I love you.

1613
01:04:58,764 --> 01:04:59,799
I love you all.

1614
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:01,501
(I love you. I love you all.)

1615
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:05,238
(He crosses with the people he loves in his heart.)

1616
01:05:06,405 --> 01:05:07,874
Haha is coming.

1617
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:11,077
I feel stable now. When he gets close,

1618
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:12,545
I might shake it.

1619
01:05:14,847 --> 01:05:16,282
(He looks down.)

1620
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:18,584
(I can't go.)

1621
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:19,752
Haha.

1622
01:05:19,752 --> 01:05:21,087
(He looked down.)

1623
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,522
It's shaking.

1624
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:23,823
Haha.

1625
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,758
Haha.

1626
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:28,995
If you come to the middle, it's less scary. Hurry up.

1627
01:05:29,295 --> 01:05:30,696
Goodness.

1628
01:05:30,763 --> 01:05:32,832
- Don't look down. - It's shaking so much.

1629
01:05:33,166 --> 01:05:35,668
Haha, it's better to keep walking.

1630
01:05:36,235 --> 01:05:40,473
I feel stable now. Never mind. I'm not stable yet.

1631
01:05:40,473 --> 01:05:42,275
I think it's better to keep walking.

1632
01:05:42,575 --> 01:05:43,910
I'm used to it now.

1633
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:45,845
(I'm strong.)

1634
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:47,547
I'm... Wait.

1635
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:50,216
What's this? I'm okay. I'm used to it.

1636
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:53,519
I'm going to puke.

1637
01:05:54,253 --> 01:05:58,624
(He's so scared that something pops into his mind.)

1638
01:05:58,624 --> 01:06:01,427
Make sure you air this as a long segment.

1639
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:02,662
We're almost there.

1640
01:06:02,662 --> 01:06:04,263
(Don't be mad.)

1641
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:09,168
Dream and Soul, watch.

1642
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:11,938
Daddy didn't crouch.

1643
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:14,106
I'm walking with my shoulders square.

1644
01:06:14,674 --> 01:06:16,242
This is your daddy.

1645
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:19,178
The lady over there...

1646
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:21,981
- I'm scared. - is Han Na. She's so strong.

1647
01:06:22,415 --> 01:06:23,616
I'm scared.

1648
01:06:23,616 --> 01:06:26,485
- I'm humming. - I'm scared. Why is this shaking?

1649
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:27,853
Don't look down.

1650
01:06:28,821 --> 01:06:30,022
(Glancing)

1651
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:31,891
I looked down.

1652
01:06:32,558 --> 01:06:34,026
I looked down.

1653
01:06:34,427 --> 01:06:35,962
- Why did I look down? - I told you not to look.

1654
01:06:35,962 --> 01:06:37,763
(Why did I look down?)

1655
01:06:37,763 --> 01:06:39,932
- I told you not to look. - Oh, dear.

1656
01:06:40,967 --> 01:06:42,501
- What now? - Sung Yong.

1657
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,203
Sung Yong?

1658
01:06:44,537 --> 01:06:46,405
You have to answer loudly when I call you, punk.

1659
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:48,874
- I'm going to faint. - I love you.

1660
01:06:49,075 --> 01:06:50,343
Me too.

1661
01:06:50,876 --> 01:06:52,745
I love all the Running Man members.

1662
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:54,614
Thank you for joining us, Han Na.

1663
01:06:54,614 --> 01:06:55,781
- We're almost there. - Han Na, can you laugh?

1664
01:06:55,781 --> 01:06:57,016
- Sorry? - Can you laugh?

1665
01:06:57,283 --> 01:06:58,417
Good.

1666
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:00,253
I feel calmer.

1667
01:07:00,953 --> 01:07:02,121
We're almost there, Haha.

1668
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:04,357
(They're finally at the end of the suspension bridge.)

1669
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:05,658
We're almost there.

1670
01:07:05,858 --> 01:07:08,294
(Is Haha still alive?)

1671
01:07:09,328 --> 01:07:10,830
You're a coward.

1672
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:13,065
The coward is coming.

1673
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:14,567
Coward.

1674
01:07:14,567 --> 01:07:17,103
(The coward is coming.)

1675
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,171
We did it.

1676
01:07:19,171 --> 01:07:20,172
My debt is forgiven.

1677
01:07:20,172 --> 01:07:21,340
(Success! All the members write off their debts.)

1678
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,341
Thank you.

1679
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:24,610
- Haha, it's not shaking. - Thank you very much.

1680
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:28,481
Thank you. Bridges in Switzerland are so sturdy.

1681
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:30,483
Thank you.

1682
01:07:31,317 --> 01:07:33,619
It's hot. It's so hot.

1683
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:35,154
This is beautiful.

1684
01:07:35,154 --> 01:07:36,722
(They overcome the longest suspension bridge in the world.)

1685
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:39,058
- Good morning! - Good morning!

1686
01:07:39,058 --> 01:07:40,359
(Meanwhile, the ski resort is not cloudy like yesterday.)

1687
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:41,527
Let's go.

1688
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:44,497
(Se Chan is not resenting anymore.)

1689
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:49,502
(Ji Hyo finally gets to fly on the snowboard.)

1690
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:50,836
Is this for real?

1691
01:07:51,103 --> 01:07:53,005
Is this for real? Let's go.

1692
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:54,674
Luxury Package.

1693
01:07:56,208 --> 01:07:59,779
(Darkness sets in the UK.)

1694
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:01,280
We're actually going.

1695
01:08:01,547 --> 01:08:03,082
It's the haunted castle.

1696
01:08:03,082 --> 01:08:04,684
(They head off to the haunted castle to finish off the package.)

1697
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:06,719
(Sighing)

1698
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:08,421
The castle is on the right.

1699
01:08:08,454 --> 01:08:09,789
- On the right? - Where?

1700
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:11,257
- I can't see it. - It's in between.

1701
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:12,391
- Is that it? - That's it.

1702
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:14,827
(That's...)

1703
01:08:14,827 --> 01:08:18,264
(the last stop of our Shuddering Package.)

1704
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:19,632
It's a real castle.

1705
01:08:19,632 --> 01:08:21,867
(Oxford Castle, a haunted castle)

1706
01:08:21,867 --> 01:08:24,170
This is the last stop in Shuddering Package.

1707
01:08:24,303 --> 01:08:26,072
Welcome to the haunted castle.

1708
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:28,307
(This is finally the last stop, the haunted castle.)

1709
01:08:31,077 --> 01:08:32,945
(It's in the middle of the night, so they get chills down the spine.)

1710
01:08:32,945 --> 01:08:34,714
This used to be a prison.

1711
01:08:34,847 --> 01:08:36,115
Doesn't it look like one?

1712
01:08:36,882 --> 01:08:39,719
- I looked at myself. - Okay.

1713
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:42,488
Why didn't anybody say that I'm really pale?

1714
01:08:42,488 --> 01:08:45,624
(You guys are heartless.)

1715
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:48,561
- We told you. - I'm so pale.

1716
01:08:48,561 --> 01:08:49,862
- Excuse me. - That's not why.

1717
01:08:49,862 --> 01:08:53,265
I was supposed to contour, but I didn't bring my makeup.

1718
01:08:53,265 --> 01:08:55,368
You should have asked me for it.

1719
01:08:55,368 --> 01:08:57,002
- Why are you getting angry? - I'm not.

1720
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:59,105
It's your fault.

1721
01:08:59,105 --> 01:09:00,239
I just said I was pale.

1722
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,174
I'm sleepy, so I'm edgy.

1723
01:09:02,174 --> 01:09:04,377
Stop it. You thanked me for doing it.

1724
01:09:04,377 --> 01:09:06,479
You said you won't forget it. Have you forgotten already?

1725
01:09:06,545 --> 01:09:07,713
Thank you.

1726
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,749
(She feels better now.)

1727
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:11,150
- Where do we go? - All right.

1728
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:12,918
Go to the basement.

1729
01:09:12,918 --> 01:09:15,788
- It's the basement? - Why is it the basement?

1730
01:09:15,788 --> 01:09:18,057
(They enter the haunted castle through the basement.)

1731
01:09:18,057 --> 01:09:20,059
- This is driving me nuts. - I really don't like...

1732
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:22,328
these kinds of things.

1733
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:24,797
What's this?

1734
01:09:24,897 --> 01:09:26,298
Oh, gosh.

1735
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,700
Are there any ghosts?

1736
01:09:27,933 --> 01:09:29,268
Oh, gosh.

1737
01:09:29,268 --> 01:09:31,370
(It feels eerie as if ghosts will come out.)

1738
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:33,205
What's this?

1739
01:09:33,205 --> 01:09:34,407
That scared me.

1740
01:09:34,407 --> 01:09:35,574
Goodness.

1741
01:09:35,574 --> 01:09:36,675
That scared me.

1742
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:39,845
(Why is the entrance like this?)

1743
01:09:39,845 --> 01:09:41,013
It crazy.

1744
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,348
"It crazy"?

1745
01:09:42,348 --> 01:09:43,749
(He's so scared he mumbles.)

1746
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:46,085
Aren't you supposed to say, "It is crazy"?

1747
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:47,853
Words keep spilling out.

1748
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:49,355
(He's terrified.)

1749
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:50,589
What's this?

1750
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:00,833
- Hurry. - What's wrong?

1751
01:10:00,833 --> 01:10:02,768
What's this?

1752
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:04,703
(He's frightened.)

1753
01:10:05,337 --> 01:10:07,440
I hear footsteps.

1754
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,941
I think it's recorded.

1755
01:10:08,941 --> 01:10:10,309
(Why does he hear footsteps in an empty hallway?)

1756
01:10:10,309 --> 01:10:12,278
- This is no joke. - It's so scary that...

1757
01:10:12,278 --> 01:10:14,680
you'll fall while running.

1758
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,015
What's this?

1759
01:10:16,048 --> 01:10:17,283
It's so narrow.

1760
01:10:17,283 --> 01:10:18,551
I'm scared.

1761
01:10:18,551 --> 01:10:21,487
(It's an unknown space covered by four walls.)

1762
01:10:21,487 --> 01:10:22,888
You can see the outside.

1763
01:10:22,955 --> 01:10:24,423
Is this the room?

1764
01:10:24,523 --> 01:10:27,893
In order to understand the history of this place,

1765
01:10:27,927 --> 01:10:29,762
please watch the video.

1766
01:10:30,429 --> 01:10:33,098
- What's this? - Oh, gosh.

1767
01:10:33,899 --> 01:10:36,469
(Why are you doing this?)

1768
01:10:36,769 --> 01:10:39,104
Hey, why would you...

1769
01:10:40,172 --> 01:10:42,308
- This is Oxford Castle. - Oxford Castle?

1770
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:46,445
(It was built in 1071, and it has been abandoned.)

1771
01:10:46,445 --> 01:10:49,849
(Since the 18th century to 1900s, it was an infamous prison.)

1772
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:52,852
(It was known for cruel torturing and death penalties.)

1773
01:10:52,852 --> 01:10:54,920
- This is so scary. - It is.

1774
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,191
(There's a mysterious male ghost in the place of execution.)

1775
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:04,930
(The ghost of a monk is witnessed in the basement every night.)

1776
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:09,502
(Screaming)

1777
01:11:10,402 --> 01:11:12,104
(He's most frightened.)

1778
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:14,940
- You're scaring me more. - I'm sorry.

1779
01:11:15,174 --> 01:11:16,208
(UK broadcast)

1780
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:19,745
(This is a mysterious place that was aired in the UK as well.)

1781
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,284
(What happened in this castle for over 1,000 years?)

1782
01:11:25,284 --> 01:11:26,785
- What's this? - What's this?

1783
01:11:26,785 --> 01:11:29,388
- Look at that person. - Look at that picture.

1784
01:11:29,755 --> 01:11:31,524
I feel like I'm going to dream about this...

1785
01:11:31,524 --> 01:11:33,659
after watching the video.

1786
01:11:34,059 --> 01:11:35,528
This is a bad idea.

1787
01:11:35,528 --> 01:11:37,129
We can't sleep here.

1788
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:38,797
We can't do that.

1789
01:11:38,797 --> 01:11:40,533
This doesn't make sense.

1790
01:11:40,533 --> 01:11:42,034
This room...

1791
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:45,037
is the oldest space in the building.

1792
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:48,207
Matilda, who could have been the first queen in the UK,

1793
01:11:48,207 --> 01:11:52,111
was locked up here for three months and died.

1794
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:55,848
So her ghost appears here often.

1795
01:11:55,948 --> 01:12:00,586
Also, 70 prisoners got massacred for having an infectious disease,

1796
01:12:00,586 --> 01:12:04,857
so this is the most cursed space in the building.

1797
01:12:04,990 --> 01:12:07,693
Many people have witnessed ghosts with deep resentments.

1798
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,695
Here's a mission that can exempt all of you from sleeping here.

1799
01:12:09,695 --> 01:12:12,932
(In this cursed space, they'll have the final mission for an exemption.)

1800
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:15,267
This is the last stage of Shuddering Package.

1801
01:12:15,267 --> 01:12:17,469
- Exemption for everybody? - Exemption for all?

1802
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:18,837
We have to succeed.

1803
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:20,472
It's a frightening loyalty game.

1804
01:12:20,472 --> 01:12:22,942
We'll conduct What Is the Ghost's Name?

1805
01:12:22,942 --> 01:12:26,712
(Last mission: What Is the Ghost's Name?)

1806
01:12:26,712 --> 01:12:28,847
I am up for anything else but loyalty game.

1807
01:12:28,847 --> 01:12:30,449
(Please)

1808
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:33,552
- I know. - This is impossible.

1809
01:12:33,552 --> 01:12:35,220
We would rather fight tooth and nail.

1810
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,288
- A loyalty game won't do. - That would be preferable.

1811
01:12:36,288 --> 01:12:37,756
We would rather fight.

1812
01:12:37,756 --> 01:12:40,426
There is a historical figure...

1813
01:12:40,426 --> 01:12:44,330
whose ghost appears the most often in this hotel.

1814
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:47,600
The name of the ghost has five syllables.

1815
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,370
The syllables are at the places the ghost is frequently sighted.

1816
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:55,107
The members will take turns finding the syllables...

1817
01:12:55,107 --> 01:12:58,277
and take a Polaroid picture of it alone.

1818
01:12:58,544 --> 01:12:59,912
Alone?

1819
01:12:59,945 --> 01:13:01,180
Do you want me to go alone?

1820
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,148
(Am I hearing things? Alone?)

1821
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:07,052
If you correctly guess the name, the mission is a success,

1822
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:09,288
and you will be exempted from sleeping at the hotel.

1823
01:13:09,288 --> 01:13:12,558
If you take a picture of the ghost,

1824
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:14,059
you will also be exempted from sleeping at the hotel.

1825
01:13:14,059 --> 01:13:15,628
(Taking a picture of the ghost exempts them as well.)

1826
01:13:16,528 --> 01:13:19,698
(I can't believe them.)

1827
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:22,368
- I can't believe them. - That's impossible.

1828
01:13:22,368 --> 01:13:24,203
Now, we should decide...

1829
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:26,138
Why doesn't Sang Yeob go first?

1830
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,874
- I want to see it. - Why doesn't Sang Yeob go first?

1831
01:13:28,874 --> 01:13:31,610
Really? Should Sang Yeob go first? That's a good idea.

1832
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:34,413
Okay. Sang Yeob is dependable.

1833
01:13:34,413 --> 01:13:36,215
Sang Yeob, you are an actor.

1834
01:13:36,215 --> 01:13:37,583
(It's sudden.)

1835
01:13:37,783 --> 01:13:40,152
What does being an actor have to do with this?

1836
01:13:40,219 --> 01:13:42,321
Come on, Sang Yeob.

1837
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:43,856
All right. I will go.

1838
01:13:43,856 --> 01:13:45,824
- That's a good idea. - I don't even know.

1839
01:13:45,824 --> 01:13:47,893
Sang Yeob hates ghosts the most.

1840
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:50,429
- I hate them. I hate them so much. - I know.

1841
01:13:50,429 --> 01:13:51,864
He repeatedly said that he hates ghosts.

1842
01:13:51,864 --> 01:13:54,500
If you take a picture of the ghost, we don't have to do this.

1843
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,834
Okay. I will be back.

1844
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:57,269
- All right. - I will be back.

1845
01:13:57,269 --> 01:13:58,871
(Sang Yeob goes in a nervous state.)

1846
01:14:03,976 --> 01:14:05,277
(From the beginning)

1847
01:14:05,277 --> 01:14:06,712
Gosh, I am so scared.

1848
01:14:09,281 --> 01:14:10,449
Let's go!

1849
01:14:12,284 --> 01:14:15,254
(He chases away his fears by making a loud noise.)

1850
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:22,461
(He enters the corridor of the prison cells.)

1851
01:14:25,064 --> 01:14:29,468
(He gathers up the courage and enters the torture chamber.)

1852
01:14:29,468 --> 01:14:32,504
(He gets scared of the instruments.)

1853
01:14:36,775 --> 01:14:38,510
I have to pull through.

1854
01:14:43,849 --> 01:14:45,184
Gosh, that startled me.

1855
01:14:45,184 --> 01:14:47,252
(He gets startled by the cameraman's footsteps.)

1856
01:14:48,187 --> 01:14:49,421
Is there a name?

1857
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:53,092
(I don't know why I agreed to go first.)

1858
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:55,494
Please pick the next person to go.

1859
01:14:55,494 --> 01:14:57,229
Let's play the game with hands.

1860
01:14:57,229 --> 01:14:58,564
- Apartment? - Yes.

1861
01:14:58,564 --> 01:15:00,232
Let's play Apartment.

1862
01:15:00,699 --> 01:15:02,101
What's that?

1863
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:03,936
- You stack the hands. - Let's begin.

1864
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,270
Then you take them out.

1865
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:08,240
(You lose if you get caught at the designated story...)

1866
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,843
(or make a sound when you get slapped.)

1867
01:15:11,243 --> 01:15:15,047
(She watches the others.)

1868
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:20,819
(The other members are absorbed in the game.)

1869
01:15:22,488 --> 01:15:24,990
(Awkward and off-beat)

1870
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:27,226
Da Hee, what are you doing?

1871
01:15:27,726 --> 01:15:30,829
- You haven't played this game. - Da Hee, what was this?

1872
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:33,265
I will learn as I play the game. Let's keep going.

1873
01:15:33,799 --> 01:15:35,434
- Will you be able to do it? - Yes.

1874
01:15:35,434 --> 01:15:36,468
Let's begin.

1875
01:15:36,468 --> 01:15:39,438
(The Apartment Game starts again.)

1876
01:15:39,438 --> 01:15:41,673
(Da Hee listens to the members...)

1877
01:15:41,673 --> 01:15:43,242
(and sings and dances diligently.)

1878
01:15:43,242 --> 01:15:45,711
Why are we doing this in the UK?

1879
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:47,513
(Why are we playing the Apartment Game in the UK?)

1880
01:15:47,513 --> 01:15:48,947
Why am I doing this in the UK?

1881
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:51,250
- Your apartment - Your apartment

1882
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:52,384
13th floor.

1883
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:55,053
- What's the floor? - 13th floor.

1884
01:15:55,788 --> 01:16:01,059
(So Min has to slap Da Hee first.)

1885
01:16:01,059 --> 01:16:02,294
One.

1886
01:16:03,028 --> 01:16:04,196
One.

1887
01:16:04,196 --> 01:16:05,664
(Is this how the game goes?)

1888
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:07,332
This is how the game goes.

1889
01:16:07,566 --> 01:16:09,868
Really? Okay.

1890
01:16:10,302 --> 01:16:11,370
Two.

1891
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:12,571
(Ouch.)

1892
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:13,939
- Did it hurt? - Kwang Soo.

1893
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:16,975
- You slapped her so hard. - This is how the game goes.

1894
01:16:16,975 --> 01:16:18,610
- What? - This is how the game goes.

1895
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:19,978
- This is how the game goes. - That's right.

1896
01:16:19,978 --> 01:16:21,046
So Min is out.

1897
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:23,148
(So Min is out because she made a sound.)

1898
01:16:23,982 --> 01:16:25,017
Two.

1899
01:16:25,017 --> 01:16:27,085
(Jae Seok's strong slap eliminates Kwang Soo.)

1900
01:16:27,085 --> 01:16:28,387
Kwang Soo is out.

1901
01:16:29,388 --> 01:16:30,622
(Three members remain.)

1902
01:16:30,622 --> 01:16:32,524
- 11th floor. - 11th floor.

1903
01:16:32,524 --> 01:16:33,992
(They have to build a 11th-floor apartment.)

1904
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:35,093
11th floor.

1905
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,328
(Seok Jin has to get slapped by Jae Seok first.)

1906
01:16:36,562 --> 01:16:37,763
One.

1907
01:16:38,297 --> 01:16:39,598
(Slap)

1908
01:16:40,065 --> 01:16:42,134
- Seok Jin endured it. - He is good at it.

1909
01:16:42,234 --> 01:16:43,702
It's Seok Jin's turn.

1910
01:16:43,702 --> 01:16:48,140
(It's Seok Jin's turn to slap Jae Seok.)

1911
01:16:50,108 --> 01:16:51,910
(Evading)

1912
01:16:52,778 --> 01:16:56,415
(Seok Jin slaps his own hand.)

1913
01:16:56,415 --> 01:16:57,816
I am out.

1914
01:16:58,183 --> 01:16:59,518
For goodness' sake.

1915
01:16:59,518 --> 01:17:01,253
(Come here.)

1916
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:04,556
What? I said I am out.

1917
01:17:04,556 --> 01:17:07,092
Seok Jin's face turned red.

1918
01:17:07,092 --> 01:17:09,828
(While they play the Apartment Game)

1919
01:17:10,295 --> 01:17:12,064
I can't find it.

1920
01:17:12,064 --> 01:17:13,198
(Sang Yeob is navigating the haunted castle by himself.)

1921
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:14,399
A syllable.

1922
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:16,735
This is no joke.

1923
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:18,503
This is no joke.

1924
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:20,472
(Where is the syllable?)

1925
01:17:23,408 --> 01:17:26,712
(He goes into the prison...)

1926
01:17:26,712 --> 01:17:29,214
(where many prisoners were held.)

1927
01:17:29,348 --> 01:17:32,584
Gosh, that startled me.

1928
01:17:33,385 --> 01:17:35,020
How do I use this camera?

1929
01:17:35,053 --> 01:17:38,757
(He finds a syllable from the name.)

1930
01:17:38,757 --> 01:17:43,061
(He finds "Bl" from the 5 syllables.)

1931
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,163
I hate this.

1932
01:17:45,163 --> 01:17:46,698
(He returns without looking back.)

1933
01:17:46,698 --> 01:17:48,233
I hate this.

1934
01:17:48,867 --> 01:17:51,503
He startled me. Did you find it?

1935
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:54,006
- Did you find it? - He found it.

1936
01:17:54,006 --> 01:17:55,240
Did you take a picture?

1937
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:56,341
Ta-da!

1938
01:17:56,341 --> 01:17:57,542
(I have one.)

1939
01:17:57,576 --> 01:17:58,777
He found one.

1940
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:00,812
(They have respect for Sang Yeob.)

1941
01:18:00,812 --> 01:18:02,981
- Bl? - Bl?

1942
01:18:02,981 --> 01:18:04,549
(Sang Yeob succeeds.)

1943
01:18:04,983 --> 01:18:08,153
It's Da Hee's turn to slap Seok Jin, right?

1944
01:18:08,153 --> 01:18:09,588
(It's Da Hee's turn to slap Seok Jin.)

1945
01:18:09,588 --> 01:18:10,923
It's a full swing.

1946
01:18:11,757 --> 01:18:15,227
(Moaning)

1947
01:18:15,227 --> 01:18:17,729
(Da Hee's full swing makes Seok Jin groan.)

1948
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:19,231
It must have hurt a lot.

1949
01:18:20,499 --> 01:18:21,767
It stings.

1950
01:18:21,767 --> 01:18:22,768
(I am sorry, Seok Jin.)

1951
01:18:22,768 --> 01:18:24,870
(It's decided that Da Hee will go last.)

1952
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,040
- Kwang Soo, you have to find it. - You have to find a syllable.

1953
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,341
(It's Kwang Soo's turn to find a syllable.)

1954
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:30,542
I will try.

1955
01:18:30,542 --> 01:18:33,145
- Make sure you do it. - Bring back a picture.

1956
01:18:33,145 --> 01:18:34,646
We will end you if you don't bring back a picture.

1957
01:18:34,646 --> 01:18:36,048
We will scold you.

1958
01:18:36,048 --> 01:18:39,051
(Let's see if the 3 cowards will succeed.)

1959
01:18:39,685 --> 01:18:42,421
(Coward number 1, Kwang Soo, sets out.)

1960
01:18:42,421 --> 01:18:43,722
What was that sound?

1961
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,258
Let's go together.

1962
01:18:46,258 --> 01:18:47,659
(Let's go together, Mr. Cameraman.)

1963
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:50,762
(Yoon Sang, let's go together.)

1964
01:18:50,762 --> 01:18:53,131
- Let's go together. - You have to go alone.

1965
01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:55,033
- No, let's go. - You have to go alone.

1966
01:18:55,033 --> 01:18:56,268
Let's go together.

1967
01:18:56,268 --> 01:18:58,103
I really can't go in there.

1968
01:18:58,103 --> 01:19:00,539
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1969
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:01,940
(They are the same.)

1970
01:19:01,974 --> 01:19:04,943
Stop walking back and forth. It's annoying.

1971
01:19:06,678 --> 01:19:08,313
- Go. - Do you want me to go first?

1972
01:19:08,313 --> 01:19:10,782
You need to go first and film me.

1973
01:19:10,782 --> 01:19:11,783
(Another set of cowards argues in front of the prison.)

1974
01:19:11,783 --> 01:19:13,285
- Go. - Fine, fine.

1975
01:19:13,285 --> 01:19:15,754
Why would you film me from behind?

1976
01:19:15,754 --> 01:19:18,256
- You have a camera. - What are you talking about?

1977
01:19:19,725 --> 01:19:21,760
(He gathers his courage and takes a step forward.)

1978
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,031
(He ends up running away.)

1979
01:19:26,031 --> 01:19:28,834
(Jae Seok, wait for me.)

1980
01:19:31,103 --> 01:19:33,205
(A director on the move)

1981
01:19:33,739 --> 01:19:35,674
(Don't scare me.)

1982
01:19:35,674 --> 01:19:37,109
You...

1983
01:19:37,476 --> 01:19:38,577
Sung Yong.

1984
01:19:38,577 --> 01:19:40,479
(He gives up right away after getting a scare.)

1985
01:19:41,113 --> 01:19:42,981
(The 3 cowards fail.)

1986
01:19:44,316 --> 01:19:45,984
Which way do I go down?

1987
01:19:47,252 --> 01:19:49,121
They said it's scary.

1988
01:19:49,121 --> 01:19:53,258
(So Min goes to the underground prison.)

1989
01:19:53,592 --> 01:19:57,929
(I wonder why the members failed. How scary is it?)

1990
01:19:58,663 --> 01:20:00,832
(The lighting is spooky.)

1991
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:06,204
(It feels like someone will come out.)

1992
01:20:06,438 --> 01:20:07,873
What should I do?

1993
01:20:07,873 --> 01:20:10,642
What should I do? What should I do?

1994
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:14,279
It was so scary.

1995
01:20:14,746 --> 01:20:16,281
Of course it was.

1996
01:20:16,281 --> 01:20:18,150
The air itself...

1997
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:21,653
- The walls emit chills. - I know.

1998
01:20:21,653 --> 01:20:23,422
That's scary.

1999
01:20:25,023 --> 01:20:29,127
(So Min braves the chills and moves forward.)

2000
01:20:30,295 --> 01:20:32,297
That's the bed.

2001
01:20:33,265 --> 01:20:40,338
(She arrives at the bedroom where the ghost is frequently seen.)

2002
01:20:42,541 --> 01:20:43,909
Isn't it here?

2003
01:20:44,142 --> 01:20:45,477
Isn't there a syllable?

2004
01:20:45,477 --> 01:20:46,878
(Isn't there a syllable?)

2005
01:20:46,878 --> 01:20:49,247
Should I take a picture just in case?

2006
01:20:51,283 --> 01:20:55,687
(I hope I take a picture of the ghost.)

2007
01:20:55,754 --> 01:20:58,123
Gosh, that startled me.

2008
01:20:58,123 --> 01:21:00,559
(So Min runs out of time before she finds a syllable.)

2009
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:03,428
- So Min. - Hold on.

2010
01:21:03,428 --> 01:21:04,729
Did you find it?

2011
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:06,865
You know, I went downstairs.

2012
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:10,836
- Did you find a syllable or not? - I went down...

2013
01:21:10,836 --> 01:21:13,472
the scary underground prison.

2014
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:17,375
I took a picture of the bed in hopes to capture the ghost.

2015
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,045
I hope the ghost is in the picture.

2016
01:21:20,812 --> 01:21:21,880
What?

2017
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,782
(What?)

2018
01:21:23,782 --> 01:21:25,951
(Is there something in the picture?)

2019
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:28,019
Isn't this it? It's a ghost.

2020
01:21:28,253 --> 01:21:31,423
(Is there a ghost in the picture?)

2021
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:36,828
(She took a picture of the wall.)

2022
01:21:36,828 --> 01:21:39,764
There is something strange on the wall.

2023
01:21:40,899 --> 01:21:43,101
It's a wall.

2024
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:45,604
- Isn't it a smudge? - No, it's not.

2025
01:21:45,604 --> 01:21:47,539
(Isn't it a smudge?)

2026
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:49,841
(The smudge is far from a person's face.)

2027
01:21:49,841 --> 01:21:51,610
A ghost?

2028
01:21:52,444 --> 01:21:53,979
Let me see it.

2029
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:55,480
It's not a smudge.

2030
01:21:56,081 --> 01:21:59,050
I took a picture of the ghost's head.

2031
01:21:59,050 --> 01:22:01,586
- Look at this. - It's not a ghost.

2032
01:22:01,586 --> 01:22:04,823
(The members only have one syllable so far.)

2033
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:07,259
How will we find four syllables?

2034
01:22:07,259 --> 01:22:09,661
Would you give us more time?

2035
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:11,630
The time isn't enough.

2036
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:13,064
Let's go, Da Hee.

2037
01:22:13,064 --> 01:22:16,034
(Let's find the rest of the syllables.)

2038
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:17,369
I will be back.

2039
01:22:17,636 --> 01:22:18,703
She is brave.

2040
01:22:18,703 --> 01:22:21,273
It was the same with wing walking. She doesn't get scared by anything.

2041
01:22:21,273 --> 01:22:23,708
I get scared of things like Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear...

2042
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:26,344
where they intentionally try to scare you.

2043
01:22:26,344 --> 01:22:29,614
Since this isn't that, I'm okay. I hate when people try to scare me.

2044
01:22:29,614 --> 01:22:31,416
The sounds won't scare me.

2045
01:22:31,416 --> 01:22:33,818
You're so cool.

2046
01:22:33,818 --> 01:22:35,887
Da Hee, can I treat you like my brother from now on?

2047
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:39,057
- Pardon? - Can you go without a cameraman?

2048
01:22:39,057 --> 01:22:40,358
- Me? - Yes, alone.

2049
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:42,727
Sure. I'll go without one.

2050
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:44,329
- Really? - Are you serious?

2051
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:47,732
I'll try going there alone. It's a bit scary, but I'll try.

2052
01:22:47,732 --> 01:22:49,634
- I want to try going there alone. - Why?

2053
01:22:49,634 --> 01:22:50,635
(They're unable to understand.)

2054
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:53,104
Why would you? It's better with a cameraman.

2055
01:22:53,672 --> 01:22:57,342
(She's strolling around with a selfie stick as if it's her house.)

2056
01:22:58,276 --> 01:23:04,549
(She explores the room with the bed in question without any hesitation.)

2057
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:08,720
(The cowards are trying their best to guess with just a word.)

2058
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,489
- "Bl". - We have to put it on there.

2059
01:23:12,524 --> 01:23:14,693
- There's a number here. - Yes, which number is it?

2060
01:23:14,693 --> 01:23:16,895
- It's number 1. - The 1st syllable must be "bl".

2061
01:23:16,895 --> 01:23:18,196
That's the first syllable.

2062
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:21,066
It's Vladimir. Right?

2063
01:23:21,066 --> 01:23:22,834
(All right! The first syllable is "bl".)

2064
01:23:23,335 --> 01:23:25,670
- Blanka? - Blanka?

2065
01:23:25,704 --> 01:23:28,406
Isn't Blanka from Street Fighter?

2066
01:23:28,406 --> 01:23:29,774
That's right. Blanka.

2067
01:23:30,609 --> 01:23:31,776
Brazilian?

2068
01:23:31,776 --> 01:23:34,479
(A five-syllable word that begins with "bl"?)

2069
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,349
- She's... - Did you find them?

2070
01:23:37,515 --> 01:23:40,752
- Yes, but I... - Did you find two?

2071
01:23:41,086 --> 01:23:46,324
No, I think I found the entire name.

2072
01:23:46,324 --> 01:23:47,459
- Really? - Yes.

2073
01:23:47,459 --> 01:23:49,928
- The entire name was in there? - I couldn't find syllables.

2074
01:23:49,928 --> 01:23:52,330
- Da Hee is amazing. - What good news.

2075
01:23:52,330 --> 01:23:55,033
So listen. I couldn't find syllables...

2076
01:23:55,033 --> 01:23:56,835
written in Korean.

2077
01:23:56,835 --> 01:23:58,837
(Not like the syllables you found earlier.)

2078
01:23:58,837 --> 01:24:00,405
- Hey, you must find them. - I...

2079
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:02,007
(Suddenly feeling disappointed)

2080
01:24:02,007 --> 01:24:05,877
I went to the place where this person shows up a lot.

2081
01:24:05,877 --> 01:24:06,911
- Was it written there? - Isn't this it?

2082
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:08,146
So what did you take photos of?

2083
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:10,048
Wait, you didn't find what you were supposed to.

2084
01:24:10,048 --> 01:24:12,350
- The Korean syllables... - How could you sound so shameless?

2085
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:15,420
- What? - Take your hands out of the pocket.

2086
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,022
I have the photos in this pocket.

2087
01:24:17,255 --> 01:24:18,923
- Did you take photos? - Show us now.

2088
01:24:18,923 --> 01:24:21,526
The English name... Isn't this it?

2089
01:24:21,526 --> 01:24:25,330
Mary... Isn't it Blandy? Blandy?

2090
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,033
- The first syllable is "bl". - It can't be Mary.

2091
01:24:28,033 --> 01:24:30,302
Isn't it Blandy? Isn't it Mary Blandy?

2092
01:24:30,802 --> 01:24:33,571
- No, "bl" is the 1st syllable. - That's the 1st syllable?

2093
01:24:33,571 --> 01:24:36,975
- Blandy Mary? - It has five syllables.

2094
01:24:36,975 --> 01:24:39,611
When I hear, "bl", all I can think of is Vladimir.

2095
01:24:39,611 --> 01:24:40,979
That was Horowitz's last name.

2096
01:24:40,979 --> 01:24:43,181
But Vladimir was from Russia.

2097
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:45,417
- Yes, he was from Russia. - Right.

2098
01:24:45,717 --> 01:24:48,853
- Blair. - That's a woman's name.

2099
01:24:50,355 --> 01:24:52,691
- "Blair Witch" is a horror film. - Yes, there is one.

2100
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:55,193
- There's a film by that name. - I even remember the poster.

2101
01:24:55,193 --> 01:24:58,730
- It's red and about a woman, right? - Right.

2102
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:00,732
Well, Blair is a woman's name.

2103
01:25:00,732 --> 01:25:03,134
I think that movie is about witches.

2104
01:25:03,134 --> 01:25:05,036
- Is the movie about witches? - Yes.

2105
01:25:05,036 --> 01:25:08,440
Anyway, she's a witch. She can be a ghost.

2106
01:25:08,707 --> 01:25:10,342
Hey, let's go with Blair Witch.

2107
01:25:10,809 --> 01:25:13,812
Let's try that. That's the best answer we can come up with.

2108
01:25:13,812 --> 01:25:15,413
- Let's go with that. - Right?

2109
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:17,615
- 1, 2, 3. - 2, 3.

2110
01:25:17,615 --> 01:25:18,616
- Blair Witch. - Blair Witch.

2111
01:25:18,616 --> 01:25:19,984
(Their answer is Blair Witch.)

2112
01:25:19,984 --> 01:25:24,889
(If Blair Witch is the answer, they won't stay at the haunted hotel.)

2113
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:26,725
(Blair Witch...)

2114
01:25:26,725 --> 01:25:28,626
That's not correct.

2115
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:31,262
(Blair Witch isn't the right answer.)

2116
01:25:31,262 --> 01:25:35,066
(We're doomed. We have to sleep here.)

2117
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,634
The right answer is...

2118
01:25:37,235 --> 01:25:38,403
Mary Blandy.

2119
01:25:38,403 --> 01:25:40,739
(The right answer is Mary Blandy.)

2120
01:25:41,139 --> 01:25:42,440
The right answer is Mary Blandy.

2121
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,209
I told you so. It was Mary Blandy.

2122
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:46,644
But you said "bl" was the first syllable.

2123
01:25:46,878 --> 01:25:48,513
I never ever said so.

2124
01:25:48,513 --> 01:25:52,183
- It says number 1 here. - It says number 3 here.

2125
01:25:52,183 --> 01:25:53,918
- Really? - What did you say?

2126
01:25:55,787 --> 01:25:59,457
(The name Da Hee discovered earlier was...)

2127
01:25:59,457 --> 01:26:02,560
(the right answer the staff had hidden.)

2128
01:26:03,528 --> 01:26:06,898
(And the hint, "bl" which Sang Yeob took a photo of...)

2129
01:26:06,898 --> 01:26:09,134
(was the 3rd syllable.)

2130
01:26:09,134 --> 01:26:11,169
- There's a number here. - That must be the order.

2131
01:26:11,169 --> 01:26:12,237
It's the first syllable.

2132
01:26:12,237 --> 01:26:16,074
(After this, they kept thinking about words that began with "bl".)

2133
01:26:16,741 --> 01:26:18,610
I don't know why, but Kwang Soo said that it was number one.

2134
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,612
- You said it was number 1. - Why did you say that?

2135
01:26:20,612 --> 01:26:22,614
You all said it was number one after reading it.

2136
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,315
- Gosh, Mary Blandy. - You all agreed that it was one.

2137
01:26:24,315 --> 01:26:27,185
- She took a photo of that. - She took a photo of the answer.

2138
01:26:27,185 --> 01:26:29,154
Hey, who said that was the first syllable?

2139
01:26:29,687 --> 01:26:32,791
- Everyone said it was number 1. - No, you said it was number 1.

2140
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:34,626
You all looked at it and said it was number one.

2141
01:26:34,626 --> 01:26:37,228
- No. - I asked if it was number 1 or 3.

2142
01:26:37,228 --> 01:26:39,597
- Everyone said it was number one. - Did I take a photo of the answer?

2143
01:26:39,597 --> 01:26:41,466
- It was Mary Blandy? - Yes, it was Mary Blandy.

2144
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:44,803
Everyone said it wasn't right. You all said I was wrong.

2145
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:50,074
(They will stay at the haunted hotel despite getting so close.)

2146
01:26:50,542 --> 01:26:56,147
(We'd like to welcome the guests of our hotel.)

2147
01:26:56,247 --> 01:26:57,582
The small one came in.

2148
01:26:57,582 --> 01:26:58,583
(Seok Jin, So Min, and Da Hee will sleep here.)

2149
01:26:58,583 --> 01:27:00,985
I'm glad. I should pick a good spot.

2150
01:27:01,519 --> 01:27:03,221
I won't sleep near the wall.

2151
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:05,924
I have no choice.

2152
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:08,092
(Gosh, how am I going to sleep in here?)

2153
01:27:08,092 --> 01:27:10,895
Darn it. What if I get sleep paralysis while sleeping?

2154
01:27:13,064 --> 01:27:16,367
What's going on with you, Da Hee? You had to wing walk during the day.

2155
01:27:16,367 --> 01:27:19,237
- Right. She did every penalty. - Yes, she did.

2156
01:27:19,237 --> 01:27:21,306
- You have the worst luck. - Today,

2157
01:27:21,306 --> 01:27:23,007
she did all the heavy lifting for this week's filming.

2158
01:27:23,007 --> 01:27:24,709
No, I don't have the worst luck.

2159
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:26,010
I just don't get good members.

2160
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:27,145
(You have no idea.)

2161
01:27:27,645 --> 01:27:29,848
Da Hee was the unluckiest.

2162
01:27:32,183 --> 01:27:34,152
Gosh, this room is so chilly.

2163
01:27:34,519 --> 01:27:36,321
I hate this cold air.

2164
01:27:36,621 --> 01:27:41,459
When you close your eyes and open them, you might see a ghost.

2165
01:27:41,626 --> 01:27:44,329
(In that case, I won't close my eyes.)

2166
01:27:44,462 --> 01:27:48,032
This is my concern. They said that this place was cursed.

2167
01:27:48,032 --> 01:27:49,434
I'm scared that I'll carry it.

2168
01:27:49,434 --> 01:27:50,435
(It won't rub off on me, right?)

2169
01:27:50,435 --> 01:27:53,505
Matilda, you're so beautiful.

2170
01:27:53,505 --> 01:27:54,839
(Matilda is a British ghost.)

2171
01:27:56,040 --> 01:28:00,378
(They lie down with a sense of foreboding in the spooky air.)

2172
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,551
(The morning breaks at the hotel. Did the members survive the night?)

2173
01:28:07,652 --> 01:28:09,921
(Snoring)

2174
01:28:10,221 --> 01:28:13,758
(They're sleeping well as if it's their house.)

2175
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:16,394
Everyone.

2176
01:28:16,828 --> 01:28:19,330
(They are in deep sleep and won't move an inch.)

2177
01:28:20,231 --> 01:28:22,600
Everyone, it's morning now.

2178
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,002
(We should head to the airport.)

2179
01:28:24,002 --> 01:28:25,303
I'll just sleep here.

2180
01:28:25,303 --> 01:28:26,571
(We should head to the airport.)

2181
01:28:27,972 --> 01:28:31,175
(She's half asleep.)

2182
01:28:31,743 --> 01:28:33,511
(Don't wake me up.)

2183
01:28:33,511 --> 01:28:34,646
What is it?

2184
01:28:35,046 --> 01:28:38,216
Everyone, a car is waiting outside. Let's hurry.

2185
01:28:38,216 --> 01:28:39,517
(We should go back to Korea.)

2186
01:28:39,517 --> 01:28:42,420
The location of this place isn't bad at all. I slept so well.

2187
01:28:44,756 --> 01:28:46,824
I slept like a log and didn't have any dreams.

2188
01:28:46,824 --> 01:28:48,459
(They're enjoying the trip as much as Team Luxury is.)

2189
01:28:48,593 --> 01:28:50,061
I slept so well.

2190
01:28:50,061 --> 01:28:52,196
(I couldn't visit since you were sleeping like a rock.)

2191
01:28:52,964 --> 01:28:54,566
It wasn't cold at all.

2192
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,468
It was warm like the embrace of my mother.

2193
01:28:57,468 --> 01:28:58,736
(The hotel was comforting like his mother's embrace.)

2194
01:28:58,736 --> 01:29:00,204
Seok Jin is so funny.

2195
01:29:00,204 --> 01:29:02,607
- He said it was warm like his mom. - Gosh, I slept so well.

2196
01:29:02,607 --> 01:29:04,042
(I think I might be back given how warm it was.)

2197
01:29:04,042 --> 01:29:06,044
- I'm going to get in the car now. - Why did you wake me up?

2198
01:29:06,044 --> 01:29:08,880
You should've let me sleep. I was sleeping really well in there.

2199
01:29:09,213 --> 01:29:10,582
(We got you a morning flight. We didn't know you'd enjoy it.)

2200
01:29:10,582 --> 01:29:12,250
- We're leaving now. Okay. - The tickets are in the car.

2201
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,419
- Good job. - We're leaving now.

2202
01:29:15,053 --> 01:29:17,355
(They completed their mission at the scary, haunted castle.)

2203
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:20,959
(The Shuddering Package ends at last!)

2204
01:29:21,993 --> 01:29:24,963
(The Shuddering and Luxury Package Projects are completed!)
