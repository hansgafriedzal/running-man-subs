1
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:08,200
- Hello. - Hello.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,130
Running Man aired a few days ago.

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:12,130
- Yes. - Yes.

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:14,775
Right afterward,

5
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,270
the Running Man homepage changed.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,270
The profiles on D web portal changed.

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
- Did they change? - If you look up...

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,320
"Running Man Haha", you will see your changed profile.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,140
So I type in my name after "Running Man", right?

10
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,540
Look at Jong Kook's picture!

11
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:30,590
I am surprised that he looks nice.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,010
Why did you use this picture for my profile?

13
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,745
It's a nice picture of you.

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:36,605
(Haha, Identity laundering)

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,220
- This is too... - Look at my picture.

16
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:42,000
Jae Seok looks too handsome.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,315
The picture suits him.

18
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,790
- Se Chan looks really pretty. - Let me see it.

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,955
You look really pretty. It's a picture I took.

20
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,570
Se Chan is Kim Jong Kook's fan. He dressed up as a girl.

21
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:54,370
- It's from the TV rating. - It's a good look for him.

22
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,070
You actually have a fan who looks like him.

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,725
- I bet I do. - I know you do.

24
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,790
- Seok Jin's picture is hilarious. - I thought he was...

25
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,140
Kim Young Hee.

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,180
- He looks like Kim Young Hee. - This picture was taken...

27
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,060
- when I was in 11th grade. - You look better in the picture.

28
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,290
- 11th grade? - Then why do you look so old?

29
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:12,950
- When was your picture taken? - It was taken in high school.

30
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,790
- You look really young. - It was taken in high school.

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,790
- You look like a baby. - What?

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,400
You look like a baby. I thought it was taken in middle school.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,810
Why am I Joong Ki's Friend?

34
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,260
- Joong Ki's Friend? - Why am I Song Joong Ki's Friend?

35
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:25,510
You do well in dramas.

36
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,085
(The profiles now reflect Jong Kook's tastes.)

37
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,585
(Please enjoy the Running Man profiles.)

38
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,965
(Today, )

39
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:38,590
(Running Man goes on a vacation with the charming ladies.)

40
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,150
(A vacation is a must in summer.)

41
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:42,590
(However, )

42
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,590
(this vacation seems to be a bit off.)

43
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,290
(It's a strange vacation.)

44
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,885
(Let's see what kind of a race unfolds today!)

45
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,290
(L Game Park in Jung-gu, Seoul)

46
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,610
This place is incredible.

47
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,745
- Hello. - Hello.

48
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,070
Hello.

49
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,870
- Hello. - Hello.

50
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,780
- Hello. - Seok Jin,

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,365
you don't have a lot of people to greet, do you?

52
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,550
I said hello to Chan Hee!

53
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,120
You should have said so.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,310
The young staff members were surprised.

55
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,780
- Are you teasing him already? - I know.

56
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,900
I don't want the staff members to be uncomfortable.

57
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,300
You should have said, "Hello, Chan Hee."

58
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,030
Have you ever been beaten up in the morning?

59
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,470
(Do you want a taste?)

60
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,970
I don't eat sweets in the morning.

61
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,115
(I refuse to take your Honey Punch.)

62
00:02:29,609 --> 00:02:32,055
Seok Jin has Honey Punch. You don't eat sweets in the morning.

63
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,840
Seok Jin turned red.

64
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,900
- Seok Jin turned red. - That was a good one.

65
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,910
I didn't expect that reply.

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,020
You didn't, did you?

67
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,050
What is this?

68
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,150
- Are you wearing this today? - We're on a vacation, right?

69
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,220
- Are you wearing this today? - Doesn't it scream vacation?

70
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,490
- Aren't you going to change? - What? This is my outfit.

71
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,545
I saw the same outfit in "Mom's Diary".

72
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:52,590
- The shoes changed. - It's a look for a vacation.

73
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,590
- He is wearing a hat. - Don't people dress like me?

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,190
Your outfit is the most out of place.

75
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,015
You can't tell from the front. From the side,

76
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:03,130
the outfit is quite revealing.

77
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,310
- Seriously. - The viewers can't see it, but...

78
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,310
Don't you know Jong Kook does that? One time, I felt like...

79
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,585
his muscles were staring at me.

80
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:11,895
I have a fear of edges.

81
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,780
Jong Kook, Yoo Seok is wearing a much better outfit today.

82
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:15,780
(Jong Kook, Yoo Seok is wearing a much better outfit today.)

83
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,090
(This is how nice I look.)

84
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,780
Yoo Seok looks like a celebrity.

85
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,180
- He looks neat. - He has blonde hair, too.

86
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,780
(Let's dress more like a celebrity next time.)

87
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:25,090
- Today... - Are we going somewhere?

88
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,190
- It's hot these days, right? - Yes.

89
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,690
It's more than just hot.

90
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,160
It's so hot that there are no mosquitoes.

91
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:33,600
Today, we will comfort your tired bodies and minds...

92
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,340
- with a vacation. - Okay!

93
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,780
- A vacation is a must in summer. - We will get to play.

94
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,680
We should go somewhere cool.

95
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
However, the decisions will be made by the unlucky members...

96
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,470
in Unlucky Vacation.

97
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:47,965
Unlucky Vacation?

98
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,490
(Running Man has an amazing history of unluckiness.)

99
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,495
(Today, everything about the unlucky members is revealed.)

100
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,645
(Let's see what happens in the end.)

101
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,270
Does that mean this is Lee Kwang Soo Special?

102
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,585
You are in no place to say that.

103
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:05,190
Seriously. You are in no place to say that.

104
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,500
- Someone else should say that. - For goodness' sake.

105
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,100
For goodness' sake.

106
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,900
The unlucky members of Running Man will be divided into two teams.

107
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,300
The winning team of each round wins a point...

108
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:18,580
and the right to pick a penalty for the losing team...

109
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,480
that fights fire with fire.

110
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,995
- It's a team competition. - However,

111
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,280
both teams will spin a roulette. One person from the losing team...

112
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:30,130
- will be exempt from the penalty. - Exempt?

113
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,330
One person from the winning team...

114
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,290
will carry out the penalty.

115
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,030
This is hardcore.

116
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:39,790
Not many people will be exempt. Wouldn't it be too hard...

117
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:42,030
to fight for one spot? Even in a winning team,

118
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,640
the unlucky members will end up getting picked for the penalty.

119
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,470
- The competition will be fierce. - It will be.

120
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,170
Before the race begins, you will pick your partners.

121
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,540
I need to be in a good team.

122
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:55,220
(The box of fate decides the unlucky and lucky members.)

123
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,110
(An unlucky member and a lucky member get matched.)

124
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:01,135
If you think you are unlucky, move to the left.

125
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:03,700
If you think you are lucky, move to the right.

126
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,790
I can't lie about this.

127
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,790
(He admits that he is an unlucky member.)

128
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:10,790
- Why? Why am I unlucky? - Hey, hey.

129
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,340
- Come here. - Come here.

130
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,510
(I am not unlucky.)

131
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,800
- Go. - All right.

132
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,670
Let's do this objectively.

133
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,100
Who went to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear?

134
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,100
Go.

135
00:05:21,109 --> 00:05:22,970
- Who went to Australia? - Crocodiles.

136
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,670
Who went wing walking? Come here.

137
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,280
- We need to be objective... - Ji Hyo!

138
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,760
- about this. - We are set.

139
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,280
I won't be picky. I will pick the rope in front of me.

140
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,280
(The lucky member pulls the rope to choose the unlucky member.)

141
00:05:34,289 --> 00:05:36,090
- Are you going to choose that? - I will choose the yellow rope.

142
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,330
- Ji Hyo, let's partner up. - I don't want Se Chan.

143
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,400
We will be couples now.

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,090
- Ji Hyo or Jong Kook. - You should go first.

145
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,090
(Ji Hyo picks the unlucky member.)

146
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:45,970
- Come on, Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo, let's partner up.

147
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,185
Pull.

148
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:50,315
- It'd be nice to be with Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

149
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,140
- Hey, Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

150
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,655
- Ji Hyo. - Is it me?

151
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,925
What are you doing?

152
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,295
- What do you mean? - Come on.

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,885
- The line was loose. - What do you mean?

154
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:01,980
- You were miming. - I do mime these days.

155
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:03,590
- You were miming. - I do mime now.

156
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,320
- Your acting got better. - She's pulling. Here she goes.

157
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,390
(Which unlucky member has Ji Hyo chosen?)

158
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,480
It's me!

159
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,530
(It's Kwang Soo.)

160
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,845
It's me!

161
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,290
Okay.

162
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,290
- Hey, he's pretending to be happy. - No, I'm happy. I'm happy.

163
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:18,840
- She hit you. Kwang Soo... - Listen.

164
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,900
- does this when he's faking it. - No, no.

165
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,730
- Jong Kook's next. - No, I never thought I'd get her.

166
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,210
- Let's pair up, Jong Kook. - Hey, on a day like this,

167
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,055
- I want Haha or Jong Kook. - My hands are lucky.

168
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:32,650
(Which unlucky member will pair up with Haha?)

169
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,820
(It's Seok Jin.)

170
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,265
Oh, no. What will we do?

171
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:39,220
(The first thing he says after pairing up is...)

172
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,280
(Oh, no. What will we do?)

173
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:41,805
This isn't that bad. It's not.

174
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:43,765
Sure.

175
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,290
- I don't think you're that happy. - Let's pretend.

176
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,630
- You were pretending, right? - They haven't paired up before.

177
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,505
- Hey, I know you're pretending. - Keep pretending.

178
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:51,400
Then two of you should pull at the same time.

179
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,340
- Okay. - Please! Please.

180
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,970
- One of them will be lucky. - Hey.

181
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,555
- Jong Kook, pull mine. - What did you say?

182
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,730
- Look at him. - We should pair up today.

183
00:06:57,739 --> 00:07:00,030
- Wait, it's been a while. - It's because...

184
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,580
You know about So Min, right? You know whom she wants, right?

185
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,125
- Who is it? - It's Se Chan.

186
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,165
Do you want me or him? Who is it?

187
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,980
No, I want Jong Kook.

188
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,195
- Of course, I want Jong Kook. - He's uncomfortable.

189
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,520
- Wait. - All right.

190
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,865
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

191
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,590
Okay, I got you, Jae Seok.

192
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,530
(Jae Seok and Se Chan form Protruding Mouth Brothers.)

193
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,660
So Min is pairing up Jong Kook.

194
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:22,090
(This means...)

195
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:23,875
- Great! - She's faking it.

196
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,030
- She's acting. - Why are you acting?

197
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,445
Both of them were acting.

198
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,925
But you know what?

199
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,315
- I'm at ease. - For today's outfits,

200
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,995
you can either wear a cool, sailor outfit...

201
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,385
or animal pajamas.

202
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,580
- I know the animal pajamas. - They are really hot.

203
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,340
(It'd be a disaster if we get the pajamas.)

204
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:42,435
The first unlucky member,

205
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:46,175
Kwang Soo, will choose the outfit for his couple.

206
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,420
Whatever he chooses,

207
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,960
- I'm sure he'll get the pajamas. - It's D.

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,115
(Will he be able to dodge the animal pajamas?)

209
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:54,720
He resembles cutlassfish a lot.

210
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,660
(Since you're a fish, get cutlassfish pajamas.)

211
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,790
Come on, I have to carefully choose my outfit.

212
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,730
I'll go with C. I choose C.

213
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,530
(He chooses C without giving it much thought.)

214
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,380
Hold on, Kwang Soo. Are you sure that's what you want?

215
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,450
- I'm sure. Trust me just this once. - Really?

216
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,710
- Wait. - Lucky members.

217
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,900
Trust this unlucky one.

218
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,280
- Sure. - Let him go.

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,020
(This lucky member is doubtful, and this unlucky member is certain.)

220
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,150
- Get the pajamas. - Get elephant pajamas.

221
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,650
(With their fates tied together, they are in the same boat.)

222
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:23,365
(What has Kwang Soo chosen this time?)

223
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:25,900
- Okay! - He got the animal pajamas.

224
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,285
(He just screams first.)

225
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,920
Nice job, Kwang Soo.

226
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:31,160
(I knew it.)

227
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,415
This was expected. This was an obvious one.

228
00:08:33,609 --> 00:08:35,975
How can you do this? How can you pick only bad ones?

229
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,870
- What is that? - Gosh, they'll be hot.

230
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,370
That's a panda.

231
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,840
- What's next to the panda? A bear? - This is so fascinating.

232
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,085
What is this?

233
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:45,010
(Is that a polite joey that's making a right-angle bow?)

234
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,580
- This startled me. - It startled me.

235
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,380
What is this? This completely startled me.

236
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,350
- I was so startled. - It startled me too.

237
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:52,875
- What is this? - It could've been bad. Lift it.

238
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,460
- Hey. - Lift this thing here.

239
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,930
- When you lift this... - That's not the point.

240
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,705
- This is a kangaroo. - Lift this.

241
00:08:58,099 --> 00:08:59,545
Gosh, I was so startled.

242
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,830
It's so hot in here. My face is turning red.

243
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,120
- Stay out of this. - It surprised me.

244
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,390
I was so startled.

245
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,945
I thought that was the back, but I saw the tail on the back.

246
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,070
(The front and back sides are both adorable.)

247
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,100
(Unlucky Kwang Soo ends up choosing cute pajamas.)

248
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:14,685
Kwang Soo, how could you get that?

249
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,770
- So Min will go second. - Wait.

250
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:17,840
She'll go next?

251
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,320
- For her, what animal pajamas... - So Min.

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,480
- So Min, don't be nervous. - You have no choice. Take that one.

253
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:24,110
Jong Kook keeps telling me that it'd be fine,

254
00:09:24,119 --> 00:09:26,980
but why do I feel like it wouldn't be?

255
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:30,335
Today, I picked you. Nothing can top that.

256
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:31,560
(Just do whatever you want.)

257
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,220
- He doesn't mean it. - There you go.

258
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:34,520
- Take that. - D, D. No, not that one.

259
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,390
(4 members in the same outfits will form a team.)

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,300
- Go for it. Do whatever you want. - D.

261
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,475
(If she chooses pajamas, they'll pair up with Ji Hyo and Kwang Soo.)

262
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,180
(So Min chooses A.)

263
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,395
(Will So Min and Jong Kook be able to avoid wearing the pajamas?)

264
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,820
(Jackpot! She gets short-sleeved, sailor outfits.)

265
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,950
(That's it! What a nice choice!)

266
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,190
Did they get the summer outfit?

267
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,220
Good job.

268
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,720
(Jong Kook and So Min pick the sailor outfit.)

269
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,375
- Are you that happy? - Yes.

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,965
- Okay. - What a relief.

271
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,190
Okay! This is awesome.

272
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,335
Jae Seok and Seok Jin will open the lockers at the same time.

273
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,970
- Jae Seok, get D. Choose D. - What?

274
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,390
- D. I want D. Let me take D. - No, I'll choose D.

275
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,445
(Lucky Se Chan recommends choosing D.)

276
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,810
- Play rock-paper-scissors for it. - Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

277
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,940
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

278
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,940
(Jae Seok will take D as he wins the rock-paper-scissors.)

279
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,315
Okay, you won.

280
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:20,580
So Min was between A and D.

281
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,410
- Let him slap you to play again. - Okay!

282
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,740
(Don't give up just yet.)

283
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,665
- Let him slap you to play one more. - Stop it, you punk.

284
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,740
- You little runt. - Okay, okay.

285
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:31,135
Do you think I won't do that?

286
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,750
- Seok Jin might really do it. - Do you think I won't do it?

287
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,480
- Hey, hey. - He will really do it.

288
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:36,750
Seok Jin will follow on it.

289
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,060
- Hey, stop that. Stop it. - You think I won't do it?

290
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,160
I'll switch.

291
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,570
- Okay. I'll switch with yours. - Okay.

292
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,800
He desperately wants that one. I'm confident about my choice.

293
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,260
Are you sure? Gosh, I think he should've gone with D.

294
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:47,630
- It's this locker. - Please!

295
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,500
- 1, 2, - My instincts told me.

296
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,680
- Three. - Please!

297
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,240
(Which one of these teams will end up wearing the animal pajamas?)

298
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:58,455
(Whatever happens, we can't wear the animal pajamas.)

299
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,290
- Okay! - Yes!

300
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,340
- Three. - Please!

301
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:03,380
(Seok Jin and Haha get the sailor outfit.)

302
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,420
Just as I expected.

303
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,510
(It was a nice choice.)

304
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,935
I told you to go with D.

305
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,330
- I should've just gone with that. - Exactly.

306
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,065
I changed at the last minute.

307
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,860
(Sailor outfit: Haha, Seok Jin, So Min, and Jong Kook)

308
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:17,090
(Animal pajamas: Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan)

309
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:19,440
- By the way, you look cute. - It's cute.

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,670
- You wear these then. - Do you want to switch?

311
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,040
- It's beyond your imagination. - It's really hot.

312
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,340
We have invited guests...

313
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,600
who will join you on your unlucky vacation.

314
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,870
They are two beautiful ladies that everyone wants to...

315
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,220
go on vacation with.

316
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,110
- Two guests? - Beautiful ladies?

317
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:36,740
- Beautiful ladies? - Come on!

318
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,695
The first beautiful lady will come out now.

319
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,545
Ta-da.

320
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,090
(Who's this lady that came out with cute entrance sounds?)

321
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,390
(The prettiest, unlucky member, Jennie of BLACKPINK)

322
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,155
- My gosh, Jennie! - Jennie!

323
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,305
Jennie!

324
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,170
(Whenever she made a decision, it was always a dud.)

325
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,970
(As she was unluckier than Kwang Soo, she wrote a new history.)

326
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,710
(Pretty, unlucky gem of variety shows whom Running Man discovered)

327
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,395
(To join the meeting of unlucky members, she visits again.)

328
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,450
Jennie is back again.

329
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,880
- Jennie. - What a surprise.

330
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,820
- Jennie. My gosh, Jennie. - Hello.

331
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,090
- You look so pretty as usual. - Jennie.

332
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,460
- Oh, my goodness. - Hello.

333
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,605
(Blocking any possible contacts)

334
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,620
(That won't work. How dare you?)

335
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:20,830
This is amazing.

336
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,930
(He's boiling with anger. What's wrong with Jae Seok?)

337
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,700
- You look so pretty. - This is amazing.

338
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,940
(They haven't changed.)

339
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,130
(Jennie's entrance is enough to get things heated on the set.)

340
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,370
Tell you what. Jennie...

341
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,910
- and Kwang Soo went into the room. - That's right.

342
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,795
- It went viral. People became fans. - The whole country became her fans.

343
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,725
(Jennie's visit to the horror room stirred up a sensation in Korea.)

344
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,190
(This is scary! There's a person in here!)

345
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,590
(In the beginning, she said she'd take the lead and acted all tough, )

346
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,375
(but she stayed in the back and ended up crying that day.)

347
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,835
(A bigger coward than Kwang Soo had been introduced.)

348
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,490
- Honestly, I easily get scared. - Right.

349
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,720
But I wasn't as bad as she was.

350
00:12:56,729 --> 00:12:58,860
- It was really scary. - I had no time to get scared.

351
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:01,470
When I was about to get scared, she started screaming.

352
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,845
I was about to get scared.

353
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,870
- My gosh. - Goodness, Jennie.

354
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,450
- I didn't know that I got... - Is that so?

355
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,795
- scared that easily. - You didn't know?

356
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,140
I was...

357
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,725
(Screaming)

358
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,090
(All of a sudden, he quietly approaches her...)

359
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,535
(and scares her.)

360
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,010
- What's wrong with him? - What are you doing?

361
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:21,735
- Have you gone mad? - What was that?

362
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:23,460
- Jennie, are you all right? - He must've lost it.

363
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,750
- He scared me out of my wits. - Have you gone mad?

364
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,070
- Viewers want to see this. - Seok Jin. Your face turned red.

365
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,540
- Remember it was all me, viewers. - Your face turned red.

366
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,200
Viewers, I did it.

367
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,710
- You went too far. - What's up with this guy?

368
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,715
I was about to do a knee strike.

369
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:38,630
My goodness, he's unbelievable.

370
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,130
(Feeling embarrassed)

371
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,100
We'll introduce the second beautiful lady.

372
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,435
Is there one more?

373
00:13:44,849 --> 00:13:48,380
(Who is it? Come on out, beautiful lady!)

374
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:49,690
It's Jin Ki Joo.

375
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,420
(The second beautiful lady shyly shows herself.)

376
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,505
(A multi-talented, beautiful lady, Actress Jin Ki Joo)

377
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,090
(She's sweeping the screens as she claims a crown for romance dramas.)

378
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,300
("Jin Ki Joo with a Cute Smile Rules the Wed-Thurs Drama")

379
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,255
("Jin Ki Joo Gets a Wide Array of Offers for Different Genres")

380
00:14:05,369 --> 00:14:08,040
(She's planning to rule Running Man with her aura that brings luck.)

381
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,655
You're joining us today, Ki Joo.

382
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:11,500
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

383
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:12,815
- Hi, Ki Joo. - Hello.

384
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,270
- Gosh, today, - Hi.

385
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,410
- we have great guests. - My gosh.

386
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,840
This is your first time on a variety show.

387
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,920
- Introduce yourself to the viewers. - Right.

388
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,850
I've never been in front of so many cameras like this.

389
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:25,820
- I bet. - It's my first time.

390
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,690
But all these cameras aren't filming you.

391
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,590
(Don't you worry.)

392
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,700
(Just be yourself.)

393
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,860
- Why did you say that? - She might get the wrong idea.

394
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:39,090
- They're not all filming you. - They're filming her.

395
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:42,025
Okay. Let me start again. Hi, my name is Jin Ki Joo.

396
00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:44,630
I don't know what to do since it's my first time here.

397
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,370
But I'll just have fun here today.

398
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,240
- She's charming. - She's charming.

399
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,135
She's perfect to go on a vacation with.

400
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:54,305
Why did you give us pajamas on a day like this?

401
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,380
- Jennie is famously unlucky. - She's "famously unlucky".

402
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:59,590
But is she also known for that?

403
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,090
Ki Joo is known to get very lucky.

404
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,105
I knew that about her.

405
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,200
Every time she takes a test,

406
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,830
- she always passes. - Really?

407
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,200
It all started with...

408
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,470
- her test with Samsung. - Samsung?

409
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,100
- She passed and was hired. - My gosh.

410
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:16,840
She worked at the company for three years.

411
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,795
But did you resign from that company?

412
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,125
Yes.

413
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:21,895
- Why did you do that? - She quit the company.

414
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:23,580
- She quit the company. - She quit?

415
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,840
- After that, - Really?

416
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:26,680
She passed the test to become a reporter.

417
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,050
She worked as a reporter for three months.

418
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,110
That's a short career.

419
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:33,560
If she worked for three months, isn't it more like a part-time job?

420
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,790
- She quit that job too. - Why? Why did you quit?

421
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,300
- She applied to be a supermodel. - No way.

422
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,160
- Really? - A supermodel out of nowhere?

423
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,700
(Strangely, she passed every test.)

424
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,220
And she came in third place at the supermodel competition.

425
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:45,755
- She came in 3rd place? - You were in 3rd place?

426
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:48,310
- You came in third place? - She was a supermodel.

427
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,310
(She has a close tie with the number 3.)

428
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,845
- And then she became an actress. - What?

429
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,310
She is lucky,

430
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,165
but she can't stay at one place for a long time.

431
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,050
(She is a vagrant.)

432
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,955
- Exactly. - She wanders around.

433
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:01,880
- Kind of. - She wanders around.

434
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:04,290
Next year, if I look for an apartment,

435
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,850
she might be the realtor.

436
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:08,160
(What will her next job be?)

437
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,590
Hold on.

438
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,850
- How can you... - You're not leaving...

439
00:16:10,859 --> 00:16:13,970
around lunch time today, are you?

440
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,890
She might leave after three hours.

441
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,860
Ki Joo. It was 3 years, 3 months, and 3 days. Is it 3 hours this time?

442
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,155
- That'd make sense. - Three hours.

443
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:25,080
It's 2018 now.

444
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,450
- She's been acting for 3 years. - Really?

445
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,425
Are you retiring soon?

446
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,450
- That's interesting. - I'm not.

447
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,380
Why did you suddenly become an actress?

448
00:16:35,389 --> 00:16:36,805
That was random.

449
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,480
As I'm a bit older now,

450
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,350
I finally had the courage.

451
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,065
(I finally had the courage to pursue my dream.)

452
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,620
- But... - But...

453
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:49,590
do you have any regrets about becoming an actress?

454
00:16:49,599 --> 00:16:50,630
No.

455
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,630
All her dramas have been successful so far.

456
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,410
That's right.

457
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,270
She is lucky.

458
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,600
She's only been in famous dramas.

459
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,925
Ki Joo is...

460
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,840
incredible.

461
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,120
She is definitely lucky.

462
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,665
Not everyone can pass all those exams.

463
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,980
Jennie became a new member...

464
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,510
of the unlucky club.

465
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,930
- She thinks it's Kwang Soo's fault. - I'm sure.

466
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,250
You've never thought you're unlucky...

467
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,700
in your life?

468
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,370
I'm very lucky.

469
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,475
She's so shameless. She keeps saying that.

470
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,260
All unlucky people think...

471
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:29,940
they're lucky.

472
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,180
Seriously.

473
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,770
I win at rock-paper-scissors every time.

474
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,970
- I'm the luckiest in our team. - Really?

475
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:37,570
Why don't you two play rock-paper-scissors?

476
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:39,650
- Try it. - With Ki Joo.

477
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,540
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

478
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:44,750
(Jennie loses.)

479
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,575
- See? - Is this your first time?

480
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,195
You just lost for the first time, right?

481
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,660
- Jennie. - This is my first time.

482
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,220
- It's like she's possessed. - You're right.

483
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,345
Kwang Soo is dangerous.

484
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,030
- It's not my fault. - It lasts long too.

485
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,060
How can she be rescued? Is there a way?

486
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,625
She'll stay this way forever.

487
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:04,410
My goodness.

488
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,440
That's a problem.

489
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,285
The guests will pick a team too.

490
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,810
- In each box is... - I see.

491
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,450
Either a sailor outfit or animal pajamas.

492
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,365
Jennie will make a choice first.

493
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,120
You can choose whichever you want.

494
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,105
I'll choose this one to be on this team.

495
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,735
Ki Joo's eyes have been on this one.

496
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,460
(The other box becomes Ki Joo's.)

497
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,630
All right, Ki Joo.

498
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,870
- Please. - Jennie...

499
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,930
- One... - Let's see.

500
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,060
(They'll open the boxes at the same time.)

501
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,445
- Two. - Please.

502
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:33,760
Three.

503
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:35,330
(Who will be sweating all day...)

504
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:38,210
(along with Jae Seok, Se Chan, Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo?)

505
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,770
(Animal pajamas or a sailor outfit?)

506
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:43,240
(Who will be wearing what?)

507
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:44,740
Gosh.

508
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,770
(Jennie chooses animal pajamas, and Ki Joo, the sailor outfit.)

509
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:47,810
- Hold on. - It's unbelievable.

510
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:49,810
- Jennie is incredible. - How can this be possible?

511
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,010
You're unbelievable.

512
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:54,050
Never blame me again.

513
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,695
You really are lucky.

514
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,600
- You're lucky. - Never blame me again.

515
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
(The teams are decided.)

516
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,700
Let's start the game after they change.

517
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,975
(The teams are decided.)

518
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,170
(Sailor outfit: Haha, Seok Jin, Ki Joo, So Min, and Jong Kook)

519
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,475
(Animal pajamas: Jae Seok, Ji Hyo, Jennie, Kwang Soo, and Se Chan)

520
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,910
(The guests change into shark pajamas and a sailor outfit.)

521
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,685
I look like a baby shark.

522
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,180
She's so cute.

523
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,095
Gosh, I can't believe it.

524
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,010
Jennie looks so cute in the pajamas.

525
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,950
These pajamas are for someone like Jennie.

526
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,435
(Dancing)

527
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:24,105
- You look very cute. - She looks so cute.

528
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,080
Kwang Soo, why are you standing next to her?

529
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:27,980
- Why are you standing next to her? - Hey!

530
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:30,915
- I can't believe you. - Jennie stood next to me.

531
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,460
She stood next to me.

532
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,670
Cut it out. Come here.

533
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,870
- Go away. - Why are you in the middle?

534
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,260
- Exactly. Since when? - Why are you doing this?

535
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,155
He's never stood in the middle.

536
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:41,045
- He wants to be in the middle. - It's okay.

537
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,715
Go to the end.

538
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,270
He told me to go to the end.

539
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:45,800
(He is pushed away.)

540
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,685
- Are you okay? - Yes.

541
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,970
All right, the first mission,

542
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:52,150
Game of Unlucky Thrones﻿, will begin now.

543
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,220
- Game of Unlucky Thrones﻿. - Game of Unlucky Thrones﻿.

544
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,780
The first game is called Unlucky Couple Touch.

545
00:19:57,789 --> 00:19:59,510
Unlucky Couple Touch?

546
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,390
In 1 of these 2 boxes is...

547
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,320
a specially-made, couple t-shirt.

548
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:05,160
In the other box is a normal t-shirt.

549
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,990
You'll choose a box randomly...

550
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,820
and wear the t-shirt in the box while playing the game.

551
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:11,330
The team with the highest score wins.

552
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:13,330
(The team with the highest score will win.)

553
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,330
(To win, you have to avoid the couple t-shirt.)

554
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,070
One person from each team...

555
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,070
- will pick a box. - Jennie will do it.

556
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,785
Jennie is unlucky too, right?

557
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,180
Then...

558
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,450
So Min, you pick a box.

559
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,240
So Min has been doing well.

560
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:26,850
I'm at least luckier than Jennie.

561
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,540
- That's right. - You can beat her.

562
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:29,580
- Right. - Jennie is...

563
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,120
Jennie will be unlucky this time too.

564
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,690
I choose this one.

565
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,235
This one?

566
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,780
- Me? - You can choose one first.

567
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:37,660
- You want this one? - I want this.

568
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,860
- I think this one is a good one. - Really?

569
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,870
She changed her mind.

570
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,560
- She changed her mind. - Then I'll choose this one.

571
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:43,940
Jennie chose this one.

572
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,200
1, 2, 3.

573
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,700
Jennie wanted this one.

574
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,710
(One is a normal t-shirt, the other one is a couple t-shirt.)

575
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,030
- They look the same. - That one looks thicker.

576
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,940
You never know. Unfold it.

577
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,880
(Who is unluckier?)

578
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,970
That one is thicker.

579
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,680
- Yes! - I can't believe it.

580
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,350
- Jennie is so unlucky. - How can this happen?

581
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,865
(Then...)

582
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,405
How can this be possible?

583
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,390
- Jennie... - Seriously...

584
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,890
I can't believe it.

585
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,580
You found the perfect guest.

586
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,460
She's even stubborn.

587
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,130
I'm losing my confidence.

588
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,060
Kwang Soo, do you want to be Jennie's partner?

589
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,855
- Go. - What am I supposed to do?

590
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,030
- You two... - You look so happy.

591
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,110
(Why are you smiling?)

592
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,425
He smiled, saying, "What am I supposed to do?"

593
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,800
- I can't let him do this. - No.

594
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:26,970
- He looks too happy. - No!

595
00:21:26,979 --> 00:21:28,110
- I can't stand it. - I just...

596
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,720
- I can't stand it. - What are you talking about?

597
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,470
- Ji Hyo should do it. - What did I do?

598
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,850
- Ji Hyo should do it instead. - Because of you...

599
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,720
- It was so annoying. - Why?

600
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,550
He should have been honest.

601
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,280
"Me?"

602
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,580
- But he was like, "Me?" - It's not okay.

603
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:44,315
- It was so annoying. - No!

604
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,700
Kwang Soo, do you want to be Jennie's partner?

605
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
What am I supposed to do?

606
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,760
(He pretends to be indifferent.)

607
00:21:48,769 --> 00:21:51,230
It was so annoying.

608
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,585
- Ki Joo, right? - Yes.

609
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:54,760
- Ki Joo, right? - Yes.

610
00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:56,800
(Determined)

611
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:57,880
- See? - Ki Joo too?

612
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,970
Just a bit.

613
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,880
- A bit, right? - A bit.

614
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll give you another chance.

615
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,335
- You hid your feelings, right? - Do a good job.

616
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
Kind of.

617
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:09,950
- Kind of? - Yes.

618
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,660
I'll give you another chance.

619
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,460
Well... Kwang Soo, do you want to play?

620
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,660
- Me? - Yes.

621
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,660
(Indifferent)

622
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,750
Kwang Soo, do you want to play?

623
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,970
(Me?)

624
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,600
- Hey! - What? Wasn't it natural?

625
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,085
- Wasn't it natural? - What did you think, Jennie?

626
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,500
Jennie agrees.

627
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:28,560
- It was annoying, right? - A bit.

628
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:30,140
- What are you talking about? - It was so fake.

629
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,710
- Just be happy. - Be real.

630
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,540
I just want you to be natural.

631
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,770
- You should have done this. - Yes.

632
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,595
- You should've been... - You expect me to dance?

633
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,350
Just be natural. This is your last chance.

634
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,660
- This is your last chance. - Okay.

635
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,195
(This is his last chance.)

636
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:46,720
Kwang Soo, be Jennie's partner.

637
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,020
(Do you want to be Jennie's partner?)

638
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,020
- Okay! - There you go.

639
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:51,520
- This is it. - Okay!

640
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:53,975
(Is this miracle really happening to me?)

641
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:56,435
- This is it. - It was natural.

642
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,290
(Come here, Jennie!)

643
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:00,640
(His reaction finally feels natural.)

644
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,685
- It's so natural. - He threw the kangaroo.

645
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,440
- It's a lot more natural. - It's natural, right?

646
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,970
- Yes! - It's so natural.

647
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:07,300
- This is it. - This is it.

648
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:08,910
- Now we can move on. - It was nice.

649
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,180
This is it. Ki Joo, was it okay this time?

650
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,720
- Yes, I approve. - You approve?

651
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,080
I can see that she used to be a reporter.

652
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,780
- Exactly. - Hold on.

653
00:23:16,789 --> 00:23:20,495
What would you write about Kwang Soo's reaction?

654
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,700
(She was a reporter for 3 months.)

655
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,750
"Fake"?

656
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,170
(Reporter Jin's exclusive and simple summary)

657
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,815
- It was annoying, right? - Yes.

658
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,330
("Is Kwang Soo's Fake Reaction Really Okay?")

659
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:36,530
Who will play against them?

660
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,380
Ki Joo should go.

661
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,610
Yes. Let's do that.

662
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,255
(Reporter Jin versus Unlucky Jenny)

663
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:45,010
(Ki Joo is happy to be wearing a normal t-shirt.)

664
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:47,095
What should I do?

665
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,450
Kwang Soo.

666
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,390
- Should you get in first? - Put your arm in.

667
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,875
(She puts on the t-shirt.)

668
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:55,820
- The height difference is so big. - Jennie is...

669
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:58,160
a good dancer, so I think she'll be good at it.

670
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,935
- I think I'll be good at it. - Right?

671
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:06,185
- Put your arm through the hole. - My arm?

672
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,410
(That's where Kwang Soo's head is supposed to go.)

673
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,210
- Her arm is supposed to go there? - You can...

674
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,710
- put your head through here. - What is this?

675
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,030
Put your head through here.

676
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,985
- This is where my arm should go. - What are you doing?

677
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,380
(Jennie's masked fan is arrested.)

678
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,650
- What is this? - Stay there.

679
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,980
This is not the right way.

680
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,165
(Screaming)

681
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,690
You can stay there.

682
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,620
- I can't see anything. - It doesn't matter.

683
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,020
- As long as we can see Jennie. - I need to see.

684
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,660
We just want to see her.

685
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,790
- I think he can see. - I can't see anything.

686
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,430
- You can see, can't you? - We just need to see her.

687
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,145
I actually can see.

688
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,030
All right.

689
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,700
(Will they be able to play the game in this t-shirt?)

690
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,940
Put your head through here.

691
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,830
- You should lock arms. - I'm in trouble.

692
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,530
- Take my arm. - Don't hold hands.

693
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:45,000
- Hold on. Don't take his arm. - Don't hold hands.

694
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:46,570
Don't take his arm.

695
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,650
It was the staff's decision.

696
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,755
- Put your hand behind your back. - Why?

697
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:51,850
(Screaming)

698
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,180
Put your hand behind your back.

699
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,650
- It's just a rule. - You can't hook arms.

700
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,465
- Put your hand behind your back. - Put your hand behind your back.

701
00:24:57,489 --> 00:24:59,460
Jennie, what do you want to do?

702
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,580
- Do you want to hold hands or not? - Why would they hold hands?

703
00:25:01,589 --> 00:25:03,250
I want to put my hand behind my back.

704
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:05,630
(Determined)

705
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,975
That's what I want too.

706
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,220
(Let's do this.)

707
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:11,330
"I want to put my hand behind my back."

708
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:13,275
(I'm just happy we're partners.)

709
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,715
(They're putting their hands behind their backs.)

710
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:17,880
- Kwang Soo, you can do this! - Okay.

711
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,270
We might have an advantage.

712
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,300
(They have to overcome their disadvantage with teamwork.)

713
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,800
Kwang Soo, use your legs too.

714
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:24,095
- Like this? - Yes.

715
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:25,810
Here it comes.

716
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:27,920
(To win, they have to burst more candies than the other team.)

717
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,495
No!

718
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:31,250
(Screaming)

719
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:33,550
(Clumsy)

720
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,720
My goodness. We're doomed.

721
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:38,130
- It's over. - I can already see the comments.

722
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,645
Focus, Kwang Soo!

723
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,020
No!

724
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,830
(Kwang Soo doesn't care about his partner.)

725
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,290
Kwang Soo, cooperate with your partner.

726
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:47,640
- Gosh. - Jennie.

727
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,125
You go first.

728
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,445
Consider Jennie more than yourself.

729
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,665
(Team Ki Joo is guaranteed to win.)

730
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:57,540
Your team won't win.

731
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:00,565
- All right. Jennie. - We got it.

732
00:26:01,249 --> 00:26:03,040
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

733
00:26:03,049 --> 00:26:04,460
- Okay. - Break the pumpkin.

734
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,580
You have to score a lot now.

735
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:09,995
Break the pumpkin.

736
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:12,505
(They go crazy during their last chance.)

737
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,820
(Their mood changes all of a sudden.)

738
00:26:15,829 --> 00:26:17,100
- Okay. - If...

739
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,640
(Their last chance is up.)

740
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,125
- It's 300. - They scored over 300.

741
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:23,125
They're in 10th place.

742
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,300
(Sadly, they score only 424 points.)

743
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,065
Why did you concentrate on Jennie, Kwang Soo?

744
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:31,335
You should concentrate on the game. Why did you keep looking at her?

745
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,310
Jennie, what happened?

746
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:34,665
It's because of Kwang Soo.

747
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,580
What? What do you mean?

748
00:26:37,589 --> 00:26:39,460
- "It's because of Kwang Soo." - I broke all of them.

749
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,480
Jennie, tell us. Didn't you explode the bombs too?

750
00:26:42,489 --> 00:26:46,130
- He pushed and pulled me. - Is that so?

751
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,345
It wasn't Jennie. It's because he pulled her.

752
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,870
She blames others so much.

753
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,940
It's extreme.

754
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,855
She gives a lot of excuses.

755
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,655
I hope Jennie won't call Kwang Soo by his name anymore.

756
00:26:57,539 --> 00:26:59,140
I hope she calls him "mister".

757
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,450
- Just call him Mr. Lee. - Call them mister.

758
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,740
- Don't call him Kwang Soo. - Call him Mr. Lee Kwang Soo.

759
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,240
He isn't her senior.

760
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,740
- This is Mr. Yang. - Me?

761
00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:10,510
- I'm sensitive about that. - "Mr. Yang"?

762
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,075
(She's sensitive about the name Mr. Yang.)

763
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,660
You feel sensitive?

764
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:16,280
Thank goodness. I'm safe since you feel sensitive about Mr. Yang.

765
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,960
- She's sensitive about Mr. Yang. - I'm thankful to him.

766
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,220
- Yang. - Yang.

767
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:21,885
(Jennie and Kwang Soo score 424 points.)

768
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:24,490
- Complete it. - Do it.

769
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,230
You can do it, Jin Ki Joo.

770
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,030
Go, go, go. Work harder.

771
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,140
- That's right. - Use both hands.

772
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,150
- She's good. - She is.

773
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,770
Do it faster. Go to both sides. Left and right.

774
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,150
That's good. It's over there.

775
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,040
Using both hands is good.

776
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:42,950
- Come on. - Hurry.

777
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,460
- Go lower. - This is so funny.

778
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,160
(All the candies disappear like magic.)

779
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,430
- That's right. - She's good.

780
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,220
- Hurry and break more. - Break that pumpkin.

781
00:27:52,229 --> 00:27:54,560
Do it faster.

782
00:27:54,569 --> 00:27:57,030
(Ki Joo shows her fancy skills as a single player.)

783
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,560
It's over.

784
00:27:58,569 --> 00:28:00,140
(The score is announced.)

785
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,470
(If she scores higher than 424 points, Team Ki Joo wins.)

786
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,730
(What is swordswoman Ki Joo's score?)

787
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:08,015
She will win.

788
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,470
(She wins with a score of 770 points.)

789
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:13,010
Great job, Ki Joo.

790
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,510
- She did well. - She did a good job.

791
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,050
Okay, I agree. You did well.

792
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,695
- I think... - Did I do well?

793
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:22,050
Did I?

794
00:28:22,059 --> 00:28:23,130
(Team Ki Joo gains 1 point.)

795
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,175
- Here's the second game. - Move back a little.

796
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:29,205
- Okay. - We should move back a little.

797
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:32,045
- Step back, Kwang Soo. - How far?

798
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,185
Step back until where?

799
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:37,610
Where? What's going on?

800
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:40,570
- There's no space. - We're shooting Running Man.

801
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:43,210
There's no space. Goodness.

802
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,150
The second mission is called 1-to-1 Unlucky Archer.

803
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,550
- I see. - Behind one wall,

804
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,050
there's a proper bow for playing games.

805
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,550
Behind another is a toy bow.

806
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,535
(Each team chooses randomly. The team to score the highest wins.)

807
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,585
(It's difficult to shoot with a toy bow.)

808
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,930
Okay.

809
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,730
- Jong Kook is good. - I'm good at archery.

810
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:05,760
Right, you're good at archery.

811
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:07,940
- Yes. - She says that she's good.

812
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
- Jennie says that she's good. - Are you really good?

813
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,380
I'm quite good at archery.

814
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,950
She's never said that she's bad at anything.

815
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,150
She always says that. I bet she'll do well.

816
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,725
She has all the qualities of an unlucky person.

817
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,435
- Give it a try, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

818
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,195
- How about... Okay. - Shall I go?

819
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,630
It's a match between two unlucky people.

820
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,930
It's about who's unluckier.

821
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,820
I'll definitely defeat Kwang Soo. You pick first.

822
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,345
I pick number two.

823
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:37,115
I pick number one.

824
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,330
Please move the divider.

825
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:40,745
Which number do you think it is?

826
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,610
- All right. - Number one?

827
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,610
- Will it be true? - One.

828
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:48,470
Move the divider in 1, 2, 3.

829
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,210
(Which bow is which?)

830
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,680
- 3. - Jennie says it's number 1.

831
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Okay.

832
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,390
(Number 2 that Kwang Soo picked is the real bow.)

833
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,690
- Kwang Soo. Okay. - Really?

834
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,690
(Everyone, I did it.)

835
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,735
- I must win this. - You must win.

836
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,360
(Is it really true?)

837
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,520
(We're doomed.)

838
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,020
- We won. - Jennie said...

839
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,035
- it'd be number one. - Jennie was wrong.

840
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,475
- She said that it was number one. - How?

841
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,370
Jong Kook should shoot the arrow.

842
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,945
- Okay. - Jong Kook should do it.

843
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:21,650
Jennie is the best on our team.

844
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,850
- We trust you, Jennie - We'll give her a chance.

845
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,565
- What do I do? - Yes.

846
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:28,240
- It's your last chance, Jennie. - All right.

847
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,865
I'll win this.

848
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,220
- Let's go, Jong Kook. - It's a knife versus a toothpick.

849
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,320
- We'll count. - Our team will play first.

850
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:37,130
- You get only 2 shots. - 2 shots?

851
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,345
Yes.

852
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,470
(Jennie, who claims to be good at it, shoots first.)

853
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,830
(This is a chance for her to regain her honor.)

854
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:47,830
(She shoots.)

855
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,445
Only two seconds remain.

856
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,880
(Jennie shoots in a stable position.)

857
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,435
(Will it turn the tables around?)

858
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,650
(It lands on the 8-point zone.)

859
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,050
- That was good. - She scored eight points.

860
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,525
That was great.

861
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,630
(She jumps in happiness.)

862
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,660
Eight points.

863
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,220
(Jennie's first shoot scores higher than expected.)

864
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:16,520
- That was great. - Good job, Jennie.

865
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:18,940
- You did well. - You really did it.

866
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,970
(Unbelievable)

867
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,045
- That was great. - Jong Kook.

868
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:24,470
- You can do it. - It won't be easy for Jong Kook.

869
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:26,570
- Let's go, Jong Kook. - It won't be easy.

870
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:27,740
It won't fly.

871
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:29,950
- It'll be amazing if you win. - Okay.

872
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,380
That's real talent.

873
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,795
(He feels ambitious about shooting with a toy bow.)

874
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,255
(It won't even fly to the target.)

875
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,550
(She tries to disturb him.)

876
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,360
(He aims his bow in silence.)

877
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,675
(He shoots.)

878
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,460
(How much will he score...)

879
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,735
(with his toy bow?)

880
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,900
(Did it land on the 8-point zone?)

881
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,445
He scored eight points.

882
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,140
- Okay. - He scored eight points.

883
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,985
(Jong Kook's 20 years of workout made it possible.)

884
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,570
- Goodness. - Did you figure out how to do it?

885
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:05,850
- Do you shoot like this? - He's so talented.

886
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,065
(Impressed)

887
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,175
(Flustered)

888
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,495
- My goodness. - Jennie.

889
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,220
- That's amazing. You must focus. - Wait.

890
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:18,550
- Score 10 points. - Let's go.

891
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,130
You must score 10 points.

892
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,670
You can't do it, Jennie. It won't work.

893
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,760
- Shoot a little higher than before. - It won't work.

894
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,940
- A little higher. - That's good.

895
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,670
(It's Jennie's last arrow.)

896
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,125
Shoot a little higher.

897
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,230
(Is Jennie really good at archery?)

898
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,300
- Shoot a little higher. - That's good.

899
00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:35,240
- Okay! - Okay!

900
00:32:35,249 --> 00:32:37,350
(Jennie is an ace after all.)

901
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,570
Nine points!

902
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:42,455
(She becomes the ace of archery by scoring 9 points.)

903
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,960
Nine points.

904
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
(We're proud of you, Jennie.)

905
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,050
- We made it. - We'll win.

906
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,750
- We'll definitely win. - We won.

907
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,400
- Stop it. - We won.

908
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,020
(Stop it.)

909
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:55,220
(I'm just so proud of her.)

910
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,470
- I'm proud. - My goodness.

911
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,400
- As long as he doesn't score 10. - Please.

912
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,530
(Team Jennie is very excited.)

913
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:02,245
(A man smiles bitterly alone.)

914
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,680
(How can Jennie score 9 points?)

915
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,945
Goodness.

916
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,230
You can do it.

917
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:07,755
(It's another impossible mission.)

918
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,065
(I believe in Jong Kook.)

919
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,510
- As long as he doesn't score 10. - Please.

920
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,390
You have a lot of time. Move it up a little.

921
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,580
No.

922
00:33:17,589 --> 00:33:19,375
(If he scores lower than 8, Team Jennie wins.)

923
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:22,820
(It's Jong Kook's last shoot.)

924
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,145
(What will be his score?)

925
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:30,315
(It lands very low.)

926
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,830
(He scores 4 points.)

927
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:34,830
No.

928
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:37,570
(Team Jennie wins with a score of 17.)

929
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,680
(Did he really score 4 points?)

930
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,365
(Laughing)

931
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:46,065
(He's speechless.)

932
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:49,365
(Somehow, Jennie turns the tables.)

933
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:52,050
(They exaggerate their celebration.)

934
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:55,235
(They won't have another chance to enjoy sweet victory.)

935
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:57,035
We won.

936
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,290
(I can't believe I lost to Jennie.)

937
00:33:58,299 --> 00:33:59,600
It stopped too short.

938
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,020
(They play the third mission.)

939
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,640
The third mission is called Unlucky Soccer Player.

940
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,030
- Okay. - It's soccer.

941
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,625
- Don't worry. - I'm most confident about soccer.

942
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,000
- We're good at soccer. - We're good.

943
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,450
The opposing team has two soccer balls.

944
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,450
We have to choose.

945
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,750
One of them is a real ball. The other is a heavy ball.

946
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,140
(One of them is filled with water.)

947
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:27,775
(Two members from each team pick a ball and play against the other.)

948
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,600
You can't hold them.

949
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,390
- Pick one, Kwang Soo. - I pick this one.

950
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,500
Do a heading.

951
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,145
(A loud thud)

952
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,230
(He picks a ball carelessly.)

953
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,085
(He falls out of frame.)

954
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:40,310
(The original, unlucky person is different.)

955
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,930
You must pick well.

956
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:44,310
- It's not obvious. - There's a lot of water in it.

957
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,125
There's a lot of water in it.

958
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,600
- I saw you. - It could break your ankle.

959
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,065
- Be careful. Shall we start? - Yes.

960
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,625
- Kwang Soo and I'll play. - Okay.

961
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,220
See who's acting.

962
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,775
They're nasty when they play.

963
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,060
- Turn around. - Turn around?

964
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,660
- Okay. - It's definitely not Kwang Soo's.

965
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,645
- 1, 2, 3. - I'm 100 percent certain.

966
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,775
It's not Kwang Soo's.

967
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,085
Do you have to hold it at that height?

968
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,290
- Hold it up higher. - Hey.

969
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:14,100
- Hold it up. - Which one looks heavier?

970
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:15,830
Hold it up higher.

971
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,830
(Which one looks heavier?)

972
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
Which one of them is acting?

973
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:21,750
- Kwang Soo. - He's pretending that it's heavy.

974
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,040
It must be Jae Seok's since Kwang Soo's seems heavy.

975
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:26,040
Kwang Soo's seems heavier.

976
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:27,520
(He picks Kwang Soo.)

977
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,140
Okay, cover us.

978
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:31,160
- Okay. - What?

979
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,060
- What are they doing? - I have no idea.

980
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Wait a minute. Don't let them go.

981
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,120
- I'm putting it down. - Just put it down.

982
00:35:37,129 --> 00:35:39,330
- The camera will film us. - Tell Jae Seok to come out.

983
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,370
- No. - Get away.

984
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,470
I'm leaving. Goodness.

985
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,770
I'm leaving.

986
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,230
- Is that allowed? - What did I do?

987
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:49,230
- Did you not do anything? - Of course not.

988
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,310
- You didn't do anything? - No.

989
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:52,580
You didn't?

990
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,000
- You have to kick this ball. - Let's go.

991
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:55,415
- Let's go. - I think that's the right one.

992
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,120
- I'm 100 percent sure. - It looks heavy.

993
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,270
It looks heavy.

994
00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:01,250
(Is it filled with water or not?)

995
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,625
Kick hard.

996
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:06,565
I knew it.

997
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,605
(Kwang Soo's ball was filled with water.)

998
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,005
(I knew it wasn't the right ball.)

999
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:14,415
(Twitching)

1000
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:17,855
(There is a sad secret behind it.)

1001
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,255
(They were suspecting the balls got switched.)

1002
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,395
(They were actually switched.)

1003
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:30,140
(The twist of fates hits Seok Jin's ankle hard.)

1004
00:36:30,149 --> 00:36:32,080
The game hasn't even started yet.

1005
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,120
- His ankle is destroyed. - His ankle...

1006
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,390
His ankle is smashed.

1007
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:38,720
- Bring my ankle back! - His ankle is completely destroyed.

1008
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,020
Is it still there?

1009
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,560
- Seok Jin's stylist, - Is it still there?

1010
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,500
Please bring a new ankle!

1011
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,520
- Seok Jin needs a new ankle. - Bring a new ankle, please.

1012
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:48,045
(That's strange. It looked like the right ball.)

1013
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,315
- Let's not cheat. - Let's not cheat.

1014
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:54,125
(It was a good idea to switch the balls.)

1015
00:36:54,739 --> 00:36:56,445
- Let's do this. - Okay.

1016
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:57,830
1, 2, 3.

1017
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,045
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1018
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:01,350
(Staring)

1019
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,950
(Let me see.)

1020
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,585
This is not okay.

1021
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,790
(Jong Kook smells something fishy.)

1022
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,980
- It's... - This is not okay.

1023
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:10,140
Turn off the cameras.

1024
00:37:10,149 --> 00:37:11,660
(I can't stand it anymore.)

1025
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,605
Turn them back on!

1026
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:16,160
- Never turn off the cameras! - Turn them back on!

1027
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
- I can't believe you. - We're shooting right now.

1028
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,120
Don't get out of frame. Stay inside.

1029
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:21,930
Go out of the frame, and you're doomed.

1030
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,585
I can't believe you guys.

1031
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,100
Gosh.

1032
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,370
The score is 0 to 0 now.

1033
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,600
This time...

1034
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:30,980
- Kwang Soo. - All we need is one goal.

1035
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,795
One goal is enough.

1036
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,000
Does it show?

1037
00:37:34,009 --> 00:37:35,040
(Haha and Jong Kook show their balls.)

1038
00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:37,585
- Jong Kook is pretending. - It shows too much.

1039
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:41,025
- Jong Kook is pretending. - It shows too much.

1040
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,410
Jong Kook.

1041
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:43,735
- Jong Kook. - Jong Kook.

1042
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,450
- Me? - Yes.

1043
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:47,335
- Okay. - We won't see it.

1044
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,250
I think it's Jong Kook too.

1045
00:37:49,259 --> 00:37:50,330
(This is their chance.)

1046
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,430
Jong Kook.

1047
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,775
(Jong Kook is bad at pretending.)

1048
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:56,775
- I'll succeed. - Gosh.

1049
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,560
What is it?

1050
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:00,060
(Kwang Soo is sure.)

1051
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,770
(What? Why is this ball bouncing?)

1052
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,000
You wanted to let him know?

1053
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:04,140
I wanted to let him know.

1054
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,545
(Haha is worried about Kwang Soo's ankle.)

1055
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:07,950
(Jong Kook's ball is filled with water.)

1056
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,080
I want you to know before you kick the ball.

1057
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,395
Kick the ball.

1058
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,735
Kick it.

1059
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,140
- Just succeed. - You can't do this.

1060
00:38:14,149 --> 00:38:15,480
Just succeed.

1061
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,065
I'll just succeed.

1062
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,410
- Just succeed. - I will.

1063
00:38:19,419 --> 00:38:21,065
Succeed, and you'll become a hero.

1064
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:24,665
(Will Kwang Soo succeed with the ball filled with water?)

1065
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,415
(Thump)

1066
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,755
(The ball just rolls.)

1067
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,505
I feel so sorry for him.

1068
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,645
Poor Kwang Soo.

1069
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,355
It must hurt a lot.

1070
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,950
- Is it that hard? - We can't get the ball in the net?

1071
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,810
- It's the last round. - Jennie, if you succeed now...

1072
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,520
- I have to kick the ball? - Yes.

1073
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,870
So Min and Seok Jin...

1074
00:38:45,879 --> 00:38:47,910
(Jong Kook is the last player on Ki Joo's team.)

1075
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,465
(How will their second match end?)

1076
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:54,235
- Seok Jin's ball looks light. - Isn't that cheating?

1077
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,735
Before...

1078
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:57,160
But it shows.

1079
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,005
- Jennie, what's your choice? - Just follow your gut.

1080
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,585
- My gut? - Yes.

1081
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:03,470
(What is her gut feeling telling her?)

1082
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,775
Just follow your gut.

1083
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,540
Just follow your gut. You can't tell anyway.

1084
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,930
That one.

1085
00:39:07,939 --> 00:39:09,430
- So Min's? - That one.

1086
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:10,715
So Min's ball.

1087
00:39:11,009 --> 00:39:12,910
Jennie, this is the last round.

1088
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,915
(Is it filled with water or not?)

1089
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,250
- She's our last player. - Please.

1090
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,620
- You can do this. - Let's do this.

1091
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,895
(The team's fate depends on Jennie again.)

1092
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,005
(You're our ace.)

1093
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:28,330
(Let me kick it real hard.)

1094
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,565
(What did Jennie choose?)

1095
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,790
(It's the right ball?)

1096
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,605
(Will she score a goal too?)

1097
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,045
- Goal! - Goal!

1098
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,910
(She reminds you of Hong Myung Bo back in 2002.)

1099
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,735
(Jennie did it again.)

1100
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,580
(She gets lucky at crucial moments.)

1101
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,755
- Jennie! - Jennie!

1102
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,750
Gosh.

1103
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,450
- In the last round... - In the last round...

1104
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:00,835
- Oh, my. - Jennie.

1105
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,645
What's with that goalkeeper?

1106
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,600
- He must recognize Jennie. - What's wrong?

1107
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,120
- What's wrong with him? - He recognized Jennie.

1108
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:09,375
- It's our turn now. - Jong Kook, please succeed.

1109
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,540
Let's get extra time.

1110
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,005
I don't think I'll succeed.

1111
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,585
The goalkeeper must see our faces.

1112
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:16,160
(Jennie's team is doing their best.)

1113
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:18,415
They should show us the balls.

1114
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,810
We can't tell whether it's a bowling ball or a soccer ball.

1115
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,125
Let's go!

1116
00:40:22,279 --> 00:40:24,250
5, 4... Jong Kook.

1117
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,580
- I'll kick Kwang Soo's ball. - Okay.

1118
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,355
- Jong Kook. - I'll kick Kwang Soo's ball.

1119
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,605
(Jong Kook thinks Kwang Soo's ball is the right one.)

1120
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:32,020
I think it's empty.

1121
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,695
- It's empty. - Are you sure?

1122
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,850
I'm sure.

1123
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,145
- The shape... - You have to succeed.

1124
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,560
All right.

1125
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,235
- Okay! - Let's go.

1126
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,500
Let's do this.

1127
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,685
(I don't know.)

1128
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:47,375
(Jong Kook faced a humiliating defeat in the archery match.)

1129
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,625
(Will he save his face this time?)

1130
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,310
(The ball is filled with water.)

1131
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,755
The camera got smashed.

1132
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,950
(Instead of scoring a goal, he breaks a camera.)

1133
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,220
We win!

1134
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,275
(Jennie's team wins the first mission.)

1135
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,180
(After being teased for being unlucky, Jennie surprises everyone.)

1136
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:11,350
Even Jong Kook failed.

1137
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,645
(Jong Kook loses to Jennie for the 2nd time.)

1138
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,645
- We did it! - Good job!

1139
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,120
As long as it ends well, it's okay.

1140
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:17,200
That's right.

1141
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,585
Is the camera okay?

1142
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:21,660
Jennie succeeded, and Jong Kook failed.

1143
00:41:21,669 --> 00:41:24,025
The winning team should write down a penalty.

1144
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:25,870
- Eat Hot Chicken Flavored Noodles﻿. - Hot Chicken Flavored Noodles.

1145
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,310
- That sounds good. - That sounds good.

1146
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,450
Wearing a duck-down jacket...

1147
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,270
- With chopped chili pepper. - It sounds terrible.

1148
00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:34,195
- With chopped chili pepper... - Wearing a duck-down jacket...

1149
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:36,580
- Hot Chicken Flavored Noodles... - With chili pepper.

1150
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,465
- With chili pepper. - That's it.

1151
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,395
What's that?

1152
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,335
We're dividing up?

1153
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,005
We must be choosing a car.

1154
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,850
It's hot, right?

1155
00:41:45,859 --> 00:41:47,200
- Yes. - Definitely.

1156
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,485
To move to our vacation place,

1157
00:41:49,669 --> 00:41:51,640
- you'll choose cars first. - No.

1158
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,600
- This is so important. - This is really important.

1159
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,830
- This is... - Please.

1160
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,700
There are five cars.

1161
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:02,250
Three of them have a lot of space and air conditioners.

1162
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,040
(3 cars have a lot of space and air conditioners.)

1163
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:07,025
They also have drivers.

1164
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,125
In the other two cars,

1165
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:11,680
you're not allowed to use the AC.

1166
00:42:11,689 --> 00:42:13,120
(They're not allowed to use the AC.)

1167
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,120
(5 people have to squeeze in with no air conditioner.)

1168
00:42:17,129 --> 00:42:18,230
I don't believe it.

1169
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,330
(They're horrified.)

1170
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,330
- On a day like this... - You'd die.

1171
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,830
It's not going to happen to me, so...

1172
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,660
(I'm lucky.)

1173
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:26,910
- You're confident. - We're not worried either.

1174
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,660
Jae Seok is so confident.

1175
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:30,085
It's going to be fun.

1176
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:33,180
One unlucky member from each team...

1177
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,750
will choose a key.

1178
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,985
You'll move in the car you choose.

1179
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,180
- So Min, you should do it. - You should deal with Jae Seok.

1180
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,065
I don't think she should do it.

1181
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,450
(Jae Seok will play against So Min.)

1182
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:45,720
I should choose the opposite of what I want.

1183
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,890
- The opposite? - I want the one in the middle.

1184
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,290
Then you should choose the opposite?

1185
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,045
So Min, avoid the one in the middle.

1186
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,665
I choose number six.

1187
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:56,470
(They make a choice.)

1188
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,540
(They always choose the same thing.)

1189
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,500
It's 1 of the 3.

1190
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,815
Unlucky people...

1191
00:43:02,509 --> 00:43:03,770
Choose that one.

1192
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:04,930
It's not this one.

1193
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,315
Not this one.

1194
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:09,350
(They both choose one on the other side.)

1195
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,565
(Thinking)

1196
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,540
(I don't think that's a good one.)

1197
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,005
Please, So Min.

1198
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:16,735
Please, So Min.

1199
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,810
(Jae Seok changes his mind again.)

1200
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,605
So Min, please. We have to win.

1201
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,890
- We have to win. - That's a bad one.

1202
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,215
- That's a bad one. - So Min, I chose it.

1203
00:43:25,629 --> 00:43:27,830
(So Min ends up with the one she chose at first.)

1204
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,470
- Open the box and press the button. - I'll wait in front of the van.

1205
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,290
Your car will light up.

1206
00:43:32,299 --> 00:43:33,540
(Who is the surprisingly lucky one?)

1207
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,085
You can do this.

1208
00:43:35,209 --> 00:43:38,000
- It looks like a good one. - We'd die in this outfit.

1209
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:39,310
Press it. You never know.

1210
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:41,025
It doesn't look like a van key.

1211
00:43:41,509 --> 00:43:47,755
(I hope the key will open a van's doors.)

1212
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:56,430
(Ki Joo's team chooses a small car.)

1213
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,750
(The heat and disappointment make her flop down.)

1214
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:00,775
- Which one is it? - The one with no air conditioner.

1215
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,545
It's 1 in 4 now.

1216
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,100
(It was 2 out of 5. I must be really unlucky.)

1217
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,730
- I told you. - It's okay.

1218
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:09,470
- Now, Jennie's team. - We might choose the other car.

1219
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,000
You might choose the bad car.

1220
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,640
When it beeps, let's get in the car right away.

1221
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,770
It's 1 in 4 now.

1222
00:44:13,779 --> 00:44:15,410
(They're so ready to get in a van.)

1223
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:21,580
(It's 1 bad car versus 3 good cars. Did Jae Seok make the right choice?)

1224
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:22,750
- Please. - 1, 2, 3.

1225
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,910
Did you press it?

1226
00:44:23,919 --> 00:44:25,080
- It's that one! - Okay!

1227
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,775
(They choose a bad car.)

1228
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,950
(Is this for real?)

1229
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,020
- This is it. - It's that one.

1230
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:35,790
(Did both teams really choose bad cars?)

1231
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,970
- This is it. - What did you do?

1232
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,200
So Min tricked us, right?

1233
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,625
No. Try it again.

1234
00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:43,275
You chose the car next to ours.

1235
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,795
- Can we check the other keys? - Go ahead.

1236
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:48,000
It was this one.

1237
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:50,350
- How could you choose those? - You chose the car next to ours.

1238
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,480
(It's almost scary.)

1239
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,680
It's unbelievable.

1240
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,080
(It's unbelievable how unlucky they are.)

1241
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,195
I'm so frustrated.

1242
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:59,505
- You guys are so unlucky. - It's incredible.

1243
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:02,250
Please get in the cars. Let's go.

1244
00:45:02,259 --> 00:45:03,330
Seriously?

1245
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,250
(They move to the vacation place with no air conditioners.)

1246
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:06,715
It's so stuffy in here.

1247
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:09,105
- Gosh. - It's so stuffy.

1248
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,560
(Steaming hot)

1249
00:45:11,569 --> 00:45:13,600
We're in the underground parking lot right now.

1250
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:15,160
- Once we go out... - The sun...

1251
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:17,480
- It's going to be awful. - This is not okay.

1252
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,645
- Gosh. - Why did we end up like this?

1253
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:22,695
What? It's all Jae Seok's fault.

1254
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,620
- I'm sorry. - It's okay. We're a team.

1255
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,310
How could So Min choose a bad car too?

1256
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:30,720
How could you both choose bad cars out of five?

1257
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,790
Gosh.

1258
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,250
- I can't even open my eyes. - It's so hot.

1259
00:45:34,259 --> 00:45:36,020
- It's so hot. - Gosh.

1260
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,505
It's so hot!

1261
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,200
Turn on the air conditioner!

1262
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,315
Ji Hyo, I can't.

1263
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:43,855
You understand me, right?

1264
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,330
It's so stuffy here. Jennie, go away.

1265
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:48,815
- Go away! It's so stuffy. - Come on!

1266
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,140
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1267
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:51,640
Stay away from me!

1268
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,310
Gosh, it's so hot.

1269
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,370
(Team Ki Joo has no air conditioner either.)

1270
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,750
It's nice to be closer to each other.

1271
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,350
We'll become close friends today.

1272
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,585
You would know.

1273
00:45:59,819 --> 00:46:02,410
As I always say, it's hot because it's the summer.

1274
00:46:02,419 --> 00:46:03,580
He's positive.

1275
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:05,835
Jong Kook is positive.

1276
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,145
Who is the handsomest in person?

1277
00:46:09,629 --> 00:46:10,700
Today?

1278
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,835
- Today. - Among the members today.

1279
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,470
Who looks better in person?

1280
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,290
"In person"?

1281
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:18,540
(My answer is...)

1282
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,640
Jae Seok.

1283
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,310
- He looks better in person? - Yes.

1284
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:22,815
(Ki Joo picks Jae Seok.)

1285
00:46:22,939 --> 00:46:24,580
(He can't understand.)

1286
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,730
How bad does he look on TV?

1287
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:28,525
Jae Seok looks better in person?

1288
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,180
His mouth protrudes less than on TV.

1289
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,140
- His mouth? - Really?

1290
00:46:33,149 --> 00:46:35,165
See him without glasses later.

1291
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,850
The screen makes you look 1.5 times bigger.

1292
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:39,180
His teeth protrude 1.5 times more.

1293
00:46:39,189 --> 00:46:41,120
- Is that so? - It's like that on screen.

1294
00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,450
(What's going on with Jae Seok?)

1295
00:46:42,459 --> 00:46:43,950
It's so hot.

1296
00:46:43,959 --> 00:46:45,450
It's extreme.

1297
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,750
Isn't it crazy?

1298
00:46:46,759 --> 00:46:48,520
- It's really hot. - Do you hear me?

1299
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:49,600
- Yes. - Yes.

1300
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,370
- Do you hear me? - Yes.

1301
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:52,755
Is something going on?

1302
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,200
For those who are suffering,

1303
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:57,830
here's a mission where you can win a chance to use the air conditioner.

1304
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,430
- Okay. - That's good.

1305
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:01,450
You can win a chance to use the air conditioner.

1306
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,695
- What? - A chance to use the AC.

1307
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,270
What do we have to do?

1308
00:47:05,279 --> 00:47:08,480
There are five songs related to the keywords I'll give you.

1309
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:09,480
"Keywords"?

1310
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:12,520
Sing 1 verse from each song consecutively.

1311
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,605
- We have to do well. - Per member in relay.

1312
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:17,830
The keyword is "summer".

1313
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,020
(Summer)

1314
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:20,375
Start.

1315
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,620
(Summer, summer)

1316
00:47:22,629 --> 00:47:26,545
(He starts with "Seagull in the Heat".)

1317
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,270
(I beg you, summer)

1318
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:34,410
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo succeed.)

1319
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,295
(Their fate depends on tone-deaf Ji Hyo.)

1320
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:45,350
(Ice coffee is perfect for the summer)

1321
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,890
- Is it from a commercial? - I think so.

1322
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,505
Is that not allowed?

1323
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:51,000
- Wait, are commercial songs okay? - It's still a song.

1324
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,390
- Right? - It's acceptable.

1325
00:47:52,399 --> 00:47:53,605
It's acceptable.

1326
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:55,700
(Sunny summer)

1327
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,140
It's by GFriend.

1328
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,160
(It's an idol singer-like answer.)

1329
00:47:58,169 --> 00:47:59,775
Okay. What's the last song?

1330
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:02,100
(Naengmyeon, naengmyeon, naengmyeon)

1331
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:04,910
(He sings "Naengmyeon" energetically.)

1332
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,270
You cleared the mission.

1333
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:07,980
(They win a chance to use the air conditioner.)

1334
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,565
- Keep it on until you arrive. - Okay.

1335
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,755
- Thank you. - Thank goodness.

1336
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,720
(They remember the lyrics.)

1337
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,350
It's so obvious.

1338
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,065
Goodness.

1339
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:23,350
Summer is included in the lyrics.

1340
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,000
- It's so hot. - Your hand is so hot.

1341
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,370
This is too much.

1342
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,520
Let's see.

1343
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:31,660
Read the consonants from the song lyrics.

1344
00:48:31,669 --> 00:48:33,970
Name the title of the song to win.

1345
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,160
- What is it? - Wait.

1346
00:48:35,169 --> 00:48:37,485
(After reading the consonants, they must name the song title.)

1347
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:41,295
(These are the consonants of the first verse.)

1348
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,315
Are these the lyrics?

1349
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:46,480
- It's the first verse of the song. - "It's time to say goodbye".

1350
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,750
- No, it's not. - "Yesterday"...

1351
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,250
- "Yesterday". - You'll start now.

1352
00:48:50,259 --> 00:48:51,480
Start.

1353
00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:52,620
Pardon?

1354
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,160
- "It's time to say goodbye". - "It's raining".

1355
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,480
- "Today". - "Okay"?

1356
00:48:56,489 --> 00:48:58,100
(Shall I start from the last word?)

1357
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,000
- "Again". - "Again"?

1358
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,830
(He guesses "again".)

1359
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,500
- "Again". - "Again"?

1360
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,910
"Now". I think it's now, right?

1361
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,560
- Now. - Now...

1362
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:11,480
- "Today"... - "Now and today".

1363
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,640
(He makes a guess with "now" and "again".)

1364
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:16,140
Isn't it "Now it's time to smile, smile again"?

1365
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:17,480
That's right.

1366
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,480
(Now it's time to smile, smile again)

1367
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,520
(Is Jong Kook's answer correct?)

1368
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,255
- That's right. - Right.

1369
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:26,980
(Now it's time to smile, smile again)

1370
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:29,390
- Right. - It's time to smile, smile again

1371
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:31,000
What's the song title?

1372
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,520
- It's "Festival" by Uhm Jung Hwa. - It's by Uhm Jung Hwa.

1373
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:34,235
- "Festival" by Uhm Jung Hwa. - "Festival".

1374
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:35,600
That's correct.

1375
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,755
- Yes! - Let's turn on the air conditioner.

1376
00:49:38,439 --> 00:49:39,970
- Okay. - That was amazing.

1377
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,145
- That was amazing. - Take them off, Ki Joo.

1378
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:45,040
How did you know?

1379
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,270
(Here comes the cold wind.)

1380
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:47,600
- That was amazing. - It's time to smile.

1381
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,180
- Turn on the air conditioner. - Really?

1382
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,165
- Now it's time to smile - 1, 2, 3, 4.

1383
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,750
(Smile again now that the air conditioner is on.)

1384
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,250
Right, this is it.

1385
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,560
(It's a happy day because it's cool.)

1386
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,310
- We were correct. - Open up the chest

1387
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:01,395
(They head to the next destination with the air conditioner on.)

1388
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:05,065
It's so cool. This is great.

1389
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:06,750
It's great.

1390
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:09,430
Look at the sky and enjoy the view.

1391
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,470
Look how blue it is. The mountains look great too.

1392
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,560
Chicken soup sounds good on a day like this.

1393
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:17,795
- That would be great. - I want naengmyeon.

1394
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,540
I'd love to eat with my feet in a stream.

1395
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:23,355
No, I don't want to put my feet in a stream.

1396
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:26,350
(He's starting again.)

1397
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,855
How about a mountain stream instead?

1398
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:29,520
- That's right. - Doesn't that sound good?

1399
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,980
- Mountain streams are great. - Aren't they the same?

1400
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,295
- No, they're different. - There should be a lot of water.

1401
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:36,465
How about eating chicken soup with your feet in the stream?

1402
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:38,120
- It doesn't sound good. - How about a mountain stream?

1403
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:39,950
(Everyone teases Kwang Soo.)

1404
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:42,085
- She prefers the mountain stream. - How far will you go?

1405
00:50:43,299 --> 00:50:44,700
- Okay. - Okay.

1406
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,870
Okay.

1407
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,430
We just don't like Kwang Soo.

1408
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:50,430
We oppose everything that Kwang Soo says.

1409
00:50:50,439 --> 00:50:53,855
Mention something delicious. Ask Jennie if it sounds delicious.

1410
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,500
Bibim noodles.

1411
00:50:55,509 --> 00:50:57,895
I don't want to eat bibim noodles right now.

1412
00:50:58,379 --> 00:51:00,350
(Okay, let's do it.)

1413
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,890
How about iced coffee?

1414
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,250
- Iced coffee? - Yes.

1415
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:08,180
- You like iced coffee. - I want mixed grains drink.

1416
00:51:08,189 --> 00:51:09,850
- That sounds perfect. - Right?

1417
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,735
(She agrees with Se Chan immediately.)

1418
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,730
Doesn't mixed grains drink sound good?

1419
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,020
That's impressive.

1420
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:17,930
- Jennie sounded so natural. - I know.

1421
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:19,870
- This is great. - She says her likes and dislikes.

1422
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,270
- That's good. - She's cool.

1423
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:22,770
I'm happy that I can be honest.

1424
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,540
You're happy that you can be honest?

1425
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,770
That's good.

1426
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:27,000
Come on.

1427
00:51:27,009 --> 00:51:28,485
- Come on. - Come on.

1428
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,915
Okay.

1429
00:51:30,049 --> 00:51:32,125
You'll be penalized even if our team wins.

1430
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,720
We're opposed to everything that Kwang Soo says.

1431
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,410
Okay, that sounds good.

1432
00:51:36,419 --> 00:51:38,450
(The car enters Yangju.)

1433
00:51:38,459 --> 00:51:39,790
We're finally here.

1434
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:41,620
(They arrive at the house where they'll enjoy the vacation.)

1435
00:51:41,629 --> 00:51:44,275
You traveled far to come here.

1436
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:47,045
- Did you make acrostic poems? - Did you?

1437
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,605
Ki Joo didn't say much, but the two of them did.

1438
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:52,060
They made one with my name.

1439
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:53,545
(What kind of poem did they make?)

1440
00:51:53,609 --> 00:51:55,930
- Are you good at anything? - Do you write good acrostic poems?

1441
00:51:55,939 --> 00:51:57,770
I want to make an acrostic poem with Jin Ki Joo.

1442
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:58,980
- What? - Give me the letters.

1443
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,410
- "Jin". - Seriously.

1444
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,255
- "Ki". - You're so cute.

1445
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:04,525
- "Joo". - That it kills me.

1446
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:06,770
(She's impressed by So Min.)

1447
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:10,810
- "Kim". - Kim Jong Kook.

1448
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:11,950
(Kim Jong Kook)

1449
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:14,275
May I call you by your name now?

1450
00:52:15,189 --> 00:52:17,200
(Of course.)

1451
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,875
- Really? - Of course.

1452
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,105
- "Jong". - It's been awkward all day.

1453
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:24,230
- That was smooth. - It was very smooth.

1454
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:25,585
"Kook".

1455
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,370
Kook.

1456
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,430
(Kook?)

1457
00:52:29,439 --> 00:52:35,910
(Kook? You're cute, Ki Joo.)

1458
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:38,295
- Goodness. - That's terrible.

1459
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,605
- "Jin". - Jin Ki Joo.

1460
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:42,410
- "Ki". - Stop acting cute.

1461
00:52:42,419 --> 00:52:44,620
- "Joo". - I'll kill you.

1462
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,335
(Haha interrupts her.)

1463
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:48,980
(That's how it ended.)

1464
00:52:48,989 --> 00:52:50,375
It's too difficult.

1465
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:53,700
- Wasn't it good? - It was all right.

1466
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,040
Jennie, make an acrostic poem. It's been a while.

1467
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,390
- Jennie makes cute poems. - She's good.

1468
00:52:59,399 --> 00:53:00,700
She was cute.

1469
00:53:00,709 --> 00:53:02,660
She made one with "Lee Kwang Soo".

1470
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:03,870
"Will you have a drink with me?"

1471
00:53:03,879 --> 00:53:05,145
(He remembers it clearly.)

1472
00:53:05,379 --> 00:53:07,770
(Lee)

1473
00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:11,080
(Now it's time that President Yang Hyun Seok will allow me.)

1474
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,270
(Kwang Soo)

1475
00:53:13,279 --> 00:53:16,480
(Will you have a drink with me?)

1476
00:53:16,489 --> 00:53:18,775
(His heart pounds.)

1477
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:21,890
I still remembered it the next day. "Did she really mean it?"

1478
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:24,350
You made him misunderstand.

1479
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:25,730
Be careful what you say.

1480
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,105
- Make another one for us. - Really?

1481
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:29,430
I'll make one with "Lee Kwang Soo".

1482
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:30,770
Again?

1483
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:33,290
- Is it his name again? - He'll misunderstand.

1484
00:53:33,299 --> 00:53:34,930
She's playing hard to get.

1485
00:53:34,939 --> 00:53:37,040
- He looks so happy. - He's happy.

1486
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,870
- He's so happy. - He's blushing.

1487
00:53:38,879 --> 00:53:39,910
(He stands next to her.)

1488
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,125
"Lee".

1489
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,750
Now that it happened...

1490
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,870
What?

1491
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:46,540
(What is she going to say?)

1492
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:48,335
- "Now that it happened". - "Now that it happened".

1493
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:50,910
My goodness.

1494
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:51,980
"Kwang".

1495
00:53:51,989 --> 00:53:53,890
- Kwang Soo. - What?

1496
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:55,120
She called his name.

1497
00:53:55,129 --> 00:53:56,330
- "Now that it happened"... - "Soo".

1498
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:57,330
(He's full of excitement.)

1499
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,565
"Soo".

1500
00:53:58,629 --> 00:54:00,545
Are you free on Wednesday?

1501
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,790
(His heart stops.)

1502
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:04,600
- Aren't you busy that day? - No.

1503
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,390
- No! - I'm completely free on Wednesday!

1504
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:07,715
No way.

1505
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,685
We'll shoot on Wednesday!

1506
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:11,680
- We'll shoot on Wednesday. - Stop them.

1507
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,810
- No. - It can't happen.

1508
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:15,370
- It can't happen. - Jennie, this isn't right.

1509
00:54:15,379 --> 00:54:16,640
- Wait. - This is wrong.

1510
00:54:16,649 --> 00:54:17,950
What are you doing on Wednesday?

1511
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,310
I have work in Japan.

1512
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,935
(She remembers her busy schedule.)

1513
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:26,310
(You're not in Korea?)

1514
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:27,930
That's fine.

1515
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,080
Cancel the shoot.

1516
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:33,020
(The shoot is canceled thanks to Jennie.)

1517
00:54:33,029 --> 00:54:34,790
- I knew it. - That's nice.

1518
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:37,290
- I knew it. - I'm not free.

1519
00:54:37,299 --> 00:54:39,870
She was just asking.

1520
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,500
On Wednesday,

1521
00:54:41,509 --> 00:54:43,580
she needed you to run an errand for her.

1522
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,080
I'm busy too.

1523
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,480
- Kwang Soo might go with her. - I have things to do too.

1524
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,040
(Let's focus on work instead.)

1525
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:53,450
The second mission is called Unlucky Diggi Bang.

1526
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,525
(Unlucky Diggi Bang)

1527
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:58,060
(It's Haha's "Dang Diggi Bang".)

1528
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,695
- That's it. - Is that it?

1529
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:04,065
This mission is made up of three rounds.

1530
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,770
The first game is called Between Hand and Face.

1531
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,160
(Between Hand and Face)

1532
00:55:09,169 --> 00:55:11,270
One member from each team will cover their eyes.

1533
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:14,160
Touch five members of the opposing team.

1534
00:55:14,169 --> 00:55:17,500
The team to guess more within three minutes wins.

1535
00:55:17,509 --> 00:55:20,850
We prepared various items for disguise.

1536
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,250
We should cover ourselves.

1537
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:23,640
(Wigs and mustaches are ready.)

1538
00:55:23,649 --> 00:55:25,580
Jennie will go.

1539
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,350
- Okay. - Let's have Ki Joo do it.

1540
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,890
Let's play Game of Wits to determine the order.

1541
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,750
- Okay. - The losing team goes later.

1542
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:33,060
- Okay. - Let's start.

1543
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,930
Ready, set, go.

1544
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,375
- 1. - 2.

1545
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,230
Three.

1546
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:40,020
(Flinching)

1547
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:41,235
Four.

1548
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,915
- 5. - 6.

1549
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,415
- 7. - 7.

1550
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,910
(Jong Kook, Seok Jin, and Se Chan fail at 7.)

1551
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,310
Was it two people?

1552
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,770
Was it 2 or 1?

1553
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:55,040
- Was it 2 or 1? - Both of them. Let's try again.

1554
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:56,895
We did it at the same time.

1555
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,250
You should sit down on purpose this time.

1556
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:00,950
I was looking for the right timing.

1557
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:03,080
You're doing this to look clueless. It looks unnatural.

1558
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:05,580
I'm not doing that. You win in this game...

1559
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:07,330
if you wait until the end.

1560
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:09,330
If there are over 10 people, you win for sure.

1561
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,620
- 10 people? - 10 people.

1562
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:12,790
If there are over 10 people, you win for sure.

1563
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,230
- Let's go again. - I'm going first.

1564
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,470
Okay. Ready, set, go.

1565
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,945
- 1. - 2.

1566
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,970
- 4. - 5.

1567
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:20,970
- 6. - 7.

1568
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:24,040
(There are 10 people playing.)

1569
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,080
("You win if you wait until the end.")

1570
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
- 8. - 9.

1571
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,525
(He lost.)

1572
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:33,625
(He waits until the end, and he's the only one left.)

1573
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,065
Hey.

1574
00:56:35,419 --> 00:56:37,980
Seok Jin did this.

1575
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:41,230
- You were doing this. - You wanted to survive.

1576
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,980
- I shouldn't have waited. - You said you'd just wait.

1577
00:56:42,989 --> 00:56:45,330
They told me to. I'm so upset.

1578
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,830
Can't I do what I want?

1579
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:48,830
- Fine, let's go again. - Why can't I?

1580
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:51,040
Why did you tell me to do this? I'm mad now.

1581
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,100
I'll do what I want. What's wrong?

1582
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,930
- Let's try again. - Why are you telling me what to do?

1583
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:57,330
You said I do this to look clueless.

1584
00:56:57,339 --> 00:56:59,100
Why would you make me feel uncomfortable?

1585
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:01,250
Seok Jin only cares about how he looks on TV.

1586
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,850
He doesn't care if his team wins.

1587
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:05,025
I didn't know this was part of the act.

1588
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,625
- Oh, gosh. - I wanted to win.

1589
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:12,375
(Team Ki Joo lost, so they dress up first.)

1590
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:16,445
Seok Jin is a bit too much.

1591
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,275
They're going that far.

1592
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,145
Gosh, Jong Kook.

1593
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,470
Details.

1594
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:24,700
(He puts something in his mouth.)

1595
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,560
Great attention to detail. I like the passion.

1596
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:29,145
It'll be confusing between So Min and Ki Joo.

1597
00:57:29,569 --> 00:57:31,310
You just need to guess So Min and Ki Joo.

1598
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:32,815
I think it'll be difficult.

1599
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:35,485
You all look so different though.

1600
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,695
Get ready. Ready...

1601
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:42,350
(She starts exploring.)

1602
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,065
What's this?

1603
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,910
(So Min distracts her by biting her.)

1604
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:47,160
(Something is trying to bite me.)

1605
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,230
Hold on. I can't tell if you're male or female.

1606
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,830
I think you're male. I don't like this.

1607
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,915
(Coward Jennie is back.)

1608
00:57:56,399 --> 00:57:58,875
You bit me. Stop it.

1609
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,085
(Hitting)

1610
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:03,870
(She's a coward.)

1611
00:58:03,879 --> 00:58:06,230
Okay, I'm done with you.

1612
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,600
What's this? This is not a good feeling.

1613
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:10,520
(What is this curly thing?)

1614
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,735
(Screaming)

1615
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,850
(She doesn't feel good about what she's touching.)

1616
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,335
(She freezes.)

1617
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,730
(It's a person's face, Jennie.)

1618
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:21,950
She's good.

1619
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:23,600
(Did I make you feel bad?)

1620
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,215
What's this? You're built.

1621
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,085
Okay, okay.

1622
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:30,775
She's good.

1623
00:58:31,169 --> 00:58:32,830
This is female.

1624
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,600
Hold on. How can I tell?

1625
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:37,315
It's female. She has soft ears.

1626
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:40,395
How... I'll go with my gut feeling.

1627
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,085
Here.

1628
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,410
(He makes his cheeks skinny.)

1629
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:46,870
Wait. You're making your cheeks hollow, right? This is weird.

1630
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:48,220
(It's weird, )

1631
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,625
(so she puts her fingers into his nose.)

1632
00:58:51,419 --> 00:58:53,195
(She's detailed. Good job.)

1633
00:58:53,959 --> 00:58:56,120
(She blocks his nostrils with a nasal endoscopy.)

1634
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:58,735
(Happy)

1635
00:58:59,129 --> 00:59:01,600
(He can't breathe.)

1636
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,835
Hold on.

1637
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:04,700
Okay.

1638
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,815
(She saves him and moves onto Haha.)

1639
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,125
This is weird. What is this?

1640
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,410
Why does it feel like something weird?

1641
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:14,680
What's this?

1642
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,040
You have one minute left.

1643
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:17,720
(She blocks his nostrils too.)

1644
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
Who are you?

1645
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,065
She always puts her fingers in the noses.

1646
00:59:21,689 --> 00:59:24,310
It feels rough. What? Haha?

1647
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,625
Hold on. You have hair.

1648
00:59:26,689 --> 00:59:27,895
(Pulling)

1649
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:30,735
(She starts plucking hair after the endoscopy.)

1650
00:59:31,299 --> 00:59:32,290
I'm done.

1651
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:33,520
(Jennie is done observing the 5 people.)

1652
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:37,105
- Okay. - Please guess the first person.

1653
00:59:37,399 --> 00:59:38,645
Hold on.

1654
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,930
Wait, I'm so confused.

1655
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:42,905
(She's confused. What's her answer?)

1656
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:45,852
Please guess the first person.

1657
00:59:45,852 --> 00:59:47,380
Hold on.

1658
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,856
Wait, I'm so confused.

1659
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,395
(She's confused. What's her answer?)

1660
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,650
Please guess the first person.

1661
00:59:51,658 --> 00:59:53,660
(She was confused with So Min. What is Jennie's answer?)

1662
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:53,760
Seok Jin?
(She was confused with So Min. What is Jennie's answer?)

1663
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,628
Seok Jin?

1664
00:59:55,628 --> 00:59:56,729
(What?)

1665
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:58,531
(How?)

1666
00:59:59,632 --> 01:00:02,335
Seok Jin, Jong Kook...

1667
01:00:02,335 --> 01:00:04,170
(She's so unlucky.)

1668
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:07,974
And So Min.

1669
01:00:07,974 --> 01:00:10,176
(This isn't good.)

1670
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:12,712
Ki Joo is here.

1671
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:14,380
(She fails to guess his gender.)

1672
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,348
How did I do?

1673
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:18,151
So Haha, Ki Joo, So Min,

1674
01:00:18,151 --> 01:00:20,119
Jong Kook, and Seok Jin.

1675
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,155
It's a mess.

1676
01:00:22,155 --> 01:00:23,790
Take the blindfold off.

1677
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,793
(What's a mess?)

1678
01:00:26,893 --> 01:00:28,228
What happened?

1679
01:00:28,228 --> 01:00:29,529
It's a mess.

1680
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:31,464
(Did I just touch that?)

1681
01:00:31,464 --> 01:00:33,233
- She's bad at this game. - Hey.

1682
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:35,268
- Hey. - She's so bad.

1683
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:37,570
How can you get Seok Jin and So Min confused?

1684
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,240
- Jennie. - You're so unlucky.

1685
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,408
- You're unlucky. - You touched So Min's face.

1686
01:00:42,508 --> 01:00:44,110
How could that be Seok Jin?

1687
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:45,411
I'm so disappointed in you.

1688
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:47,914
- I feel bad. - Did you think I'd bite?

1689
01:00:48,248 --> 01:00:50,950
She touched Seok Jin's face and said it was Ki Joo.

1690
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:53,253
Why did she put her fingers into his nose?

1691
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:54,754
Oh, gosh.

1692
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:57,724
I'm so sorry. I couldn't see, so I lost my senses.

1693
01:00:57,724 --> 01:01:00,460
Did you see when she touched Jong Kook's face?

1694
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,961
"This is not a good feeling."

1695
01:01:02,395 --> 01:01:03,763
Did I make you feel bad?

1696
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:07,634
No. When you can't see, you lose your senses.

1697
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:08,868
What now?

1698
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:10,870
(It's Ki Joo's turn to guess.)

1699
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,806
Is this how you put it on? Is this right?

1700
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:19,212
(Is his how you put this on?)

1701
01:01:19,212 --> 01:01:21,547
- Even with the disguise, - He's laughing at himself.

1702
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:23,783
- You look fine. - you still look cute.

1703
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,018
(They're drawn to her.)

1704
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:26,119
Good for you.

1705
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:27,854
(They fall for her.)

1706
01:01:27,854 --> 01:01:29,155
She was born like that.

1707
01:01:29,155 --> 01:01:30,189
(Give me the mirror.)

1708
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,325
I look like I'm doing comedy.

1709
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:35,495
(Let me see my face.)

1710
01:01:35,495 --> 01:01:36,963
(What's this?)

1711
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:38,698
- You look like a criminal. - Kwang Soo.

1712
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:41,200
I looked at myself and ignored it. I didn't think it was me.

1713
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,669
(What's that?)

1714
01:01:42,669 --> 01:01:44,304
(She's terrified.)

1715
01:01:44,304 --> 01:01:47,140
Why are you screaming? Jennie, that's not nice.

1716
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:49,309
She collapsed. She looked at Kwang Soo's face.

1717
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:50,843
I've seen somebody like that.

1718
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:53,780
Me too. I know somebody like that.

1719
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,781
(Somebody must look like this.)

1720
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:56,416
I've seen somebody like that too.

1721
01:01:56,649 --> 01:01:58,318
- Get ready. - Doesn't he look...

1722
01:01:58,318 --> 01:01:59,953
kind of like Bbaek Ga?

1723
01:02:00,019 --> 01:02:03,089
- That's true. - Bbaek Ga from a while back.

1724
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,490
Please get ready.

1725
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:08,928
You have three minutes. You have to guess within that time.

1726
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,596
Are you ready?

1727
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,233
What's this? There were wigs too.

1728
01:02:14,233 --> 01:02:16,069
I can't tell if it's female or male then.

1729
01:02:16,135 --> 01:02:17,770
(She can't even tell the gender.)

1730
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:21,341
(She's thorough. She touches his ear.)

1731
01:02:21,341 --> 01:02:22,842
It's male.

1732
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:25,111
(Good job, Ki Joo.)

1733
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:27,547
Okay. I'm okay with this person.

1734
01:02:28,281 --> 01:02:30,850
- Next. - Yes, that's next.

1735
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,685
(I hope she doesn't get it right.)

1736
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:36,089
(She tries to put her hand in the mouth.)

1737
01:02:37,423 --> 01:02:38,992
She thinks something is inside.

1738
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:40,059
Your teeth...

1739
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:42,362
She thinks something is inside.

1740
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:44,130
(She has a feeling.)

1741
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:47,500
I got it. Okay.

1742
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,569
(Are we that obvious?)

1743
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:51,204
Remember the order.

1744
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:54,474
Goodness, this is so obvious. She's so small.

1745
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:56,709
(She's good at this. She knows all of them.)

1746
01:02:56,709 --> 01:02:57,744
Next.

1747
01:02:57,744 --> 01:02:59,679
(She's good at this. She knows all of them.)

1748
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,280
This person is trying to cover this up.

1749
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,582
- I got it. - She knows.

1750
01:03:02,582 --> 01:03:06,619
This is the remaining person. I just have to confirm. Nicely?

1751
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,920
Okay.

1752
01:03:08,955 --> 01:03:11,891
(She still has time, but she's done.)

1753
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:14,694
First person is Kwang Soo.

1754
01:03:14,861 --> 01:03:17,230
Se Chan is next.

1755
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:21,234
Jennie is the third person. Jae Seok is next,

1756
01:03:21,334 --> 01:03:23,503
and Ji Hyo. It's Ji Hyo.

1757
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:24,804
(She guesses all 5 people right.)

1758
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,240
(Team Ki Joo wins.)

1759
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,241
We almost had it.

1760
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:31,010
- You got everything? You did. - How did you get Kwang Soo?

1761
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,279
I knew it was Jennie in one second.

1762
01:03:33,279 --> 01:03:35,448
Team Ki Joo wins the first round.

1763
01:03:35,548 --> 01:03:37,950
Second round is a team game.

1764
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:41,487
- We have to win this time. - We have to win to make it a tie.

1765
01:03:41,654 --> 01:03:45,058
Second round is a team game. It's called Between the Cheeks.

1766
01:03:45,058 --> 01:03:46,559
(Second mission: Between the Cheeks)

1767
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,461
- Between the Cheeks? - Three people...

1768
01:03:48,461 --> 01:03:50,530
go upstairs and present the question.

1769
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,232
Two people stay here and try to guess the right answer.

1770
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:56,035
Two people downstairs have to put blindfolds on...

1771
01:03:56,035 --> 01:03:58,371
and pick 1 person out of the 3 who are holding fishing rods...

1772
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,573
with different items attached to it.

1773
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:03,409
You have to feel the item between your cheeks...

1774
01:04:03,409 --> 01:04:05,478
and guess what it is within the time limit.

1775
01:04:05,478 --> 01:04:07,814
Please select who will do what.

1776
01:04:07,814 --> 01:04:10,750
- Okay. - We already know.

1777
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,151
Jennie and Ji Hyo.

1778
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:13,453
Jennie will go insane.

1779
01:04:13,453 --> 01:04:15,488
- She'll faint. - I know.

1780
01:04:15,488 --> 01:04:17,490
- She will. - It's scary.

1781
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,425
- This game is for her. - We'll go with her.

1782
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:22,128
(Team Jennie goes first.)

1783
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:25,031
Do we pick one person and guess what their item is?

1784
01:04:25,031 --> 01:04:26,999
I'll let you choose.

1785
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,301
Okay.

1786
01:04:29,235 --> 01:04:30,703
What are these?

1787
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:32,638
- What's this? - Nose pack?

1788
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:35,041
You can pick one fishing rod each.

1789
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,476
This is hard to guess.

1790
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:39,712
This is hard. How are you supposed to guess?

1791
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:41,514
I don't think they'll choose me.

1792
01:04:41,514 --> 01:04:42,582
I'll pick the pig skin.

1793
01:04:42,582 --> 01:04:43,749
Okay.

1794
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:44,951
(He probably won't get picked, so he chooses the pig skin.)

1795
01:04:44,951 --> 01:04:46,252
I don't think they'll pick me.

1796
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,855
- They might pick you. - There's a good chance.

1797
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:50,189
This one's easy.

1798
01:04:50,189 --> 01:04:51,724
- Is this better? - It is.

1799
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:54,026
Is this easier to guess? Okay.

1800
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,596
- Did you make your mind? - Yes.

1801
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:00,566
All right. Please pick one person.

1802
01:05:00,633 --> 01:05:02,168
(Ji Hyo and Jennie have to pick one person.)

1803
01:05:02,168 --> 01:05:03,603
Oh, no.

1804
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,739
- Oh, my goodness. - Jennie will go nuts.

1805
01:05:06,739 --> 01:05:08,574
I'm scared.

1806
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,809
Number 1, 2, or 3.

1807
01:05:09,809 --> 01:05:12,211
Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, or Se Chan.

1808
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:13,412
Who shall I pick, Jennie?

1809
01:05:13,412 --> 01:05:14,847
(You can choose.)

1810
01:05:15,114 --> 01:05:18,584
(Please avoid Kwang Soo with the pig skin.)

1811
01:05:18,584 --> 01:05:19,819
- Who shall I pick, Jennie? - 1, 2, 3.

1812
01:05:19,819 --> 01:05:21,320
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1813
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,488
(She's unlucky again.)

1814
01:05:22,488 --> 01:05:23,689
1, 2, 3.

1815
01:05:23,689 --> 01:05:24,924
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1816
01:05:24,924 --> 01:05:26,092
(She chooses the most difficult one without hesitation.)

1817
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:27,426
Kwang Soo.

1818
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:30,630
Goodness. What now?

1819
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,898
(You said they won't pick you.)

1820
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:33,866
(I know.)

1821
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,969
(This is the unlucky synergy effect.)

1822
01:05:36,969 --> 01:05:38,971
She picked the worst one.

1823
01:05:38,971 --> 01:05:40,606
You have three minutes.

1824
01:05:40,673 --> 01:05:41,741
Ready,

1825
01:05:41,741 --> 01:05:43,709
- Hold on. When is it coming? - set...

1826
01:05:43,709 --> 01:05:46,078
- Tell us when it's coming. - Tell us.

1827
01:05:46,078 --> 01:05:48,080
(Between the Cheeks starts.)

1828
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,515
It's coming down.

1829
01:05:49,515 --> 01:05:51,250
(Here comes the pig skin.)

1830
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,418
Tell me.

1831
01:05:52,418 --> 01:05:53,519
Tell me when it's coming.

1832
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,389
Hey, hey.

1833
01:05:56,389 --> 01:05:57,690
- Try again. - Goodness.

1834
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,792
- How gross. - Hey, hey.

1835
01:05:59,792 --> 01:06:01,694
- You have to aim. - Hey, hey.

1836
01:06:02,228 --> 01:06:04,363
- Where is it? - No.

1837
01:06:04,363 --> 01:06:05,464
It's behind.

1838
01:06:05,464 --> 01:06:09,635
(Shrieking)

1839
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:12,104
- Was that it? - It brushed past my lips.

1840
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:14,040
- Here? - What will you do?

1841
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,108
Goodness.

1842
01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:18,144
Hit their noses.

1843
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:20,446
(It's not that bad.)

1844
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,381
(She moves a little.)

1845
01:06:22,381 --> 01:06:25,117
(Screaming)

1846
01:06:25,184 --> 01:06:28,054
(She's about to faint.)

1847
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,156
Jennie!

1848
01:06:30,923 --> 01:06:33,192
- Ji Hyo. - I can't do this.

1849
01:06:33,192 --> 01:06:35,161
This isn't supposed to be like that.

1850
01:06:35,795 --> 01:06:36,929
I can't do anything else.

1851
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,265
- I have no choice. - Guess.

1852
01:06:39,298 --> 01:06:41,534
Hold on. Where is it?

1853
01:06:42,401 --> 01:06:43,769
(I'll put it in my mouth.)

1854
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:44,870
(Shrieking)

1855
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:47,340
(She'll sing better after this.)

1856
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:48,341
(You scared me more.)

1857
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:50,009
- Ji Hyo. - Jennie.

1858
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:52,878
(It touches her slightly.)

1859
01:06:52,878 --> 01:06:57,216
(Wailing)

1860
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:58,951
- What's this? - Ji Hyo.

1861
01:06:59,218 --> 01:07:01,787
Their reaction is different.

1862
01:07:01,887 --> 01:07:03,489
(This isn't that bad.)

1863
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:04,690
Hey.

1864
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,993
Guess.

1865
01:07:07,493 --> 01:07:09,095
Hold on. It's here.

1866
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:11,130
That's one minute.

1867
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,765
(They wasted 1 minute by screaming. They have to guess now.)

1868
01:07:12,765 --> 01:07:15,501
(They're bolder.)

1869
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:17,203
(They're paying attention now. Will they get it?)

1870
01:07:17,203 --> 01:07:19,505
- It's sharp. Take it out. - That's one minute.

1871
01:07:19,505 --> 01:07:21,040
- Take it out. - Hey.

1872
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,108
(They're paying attention now. Will they get it?)

1873
01:07:22,108 --> 01:07:23,709
(Licking)

1874
01:07:23,709 --> 01:07:25,711
What was that?

1875
01:07:26,045 --> 01:07:28,514
(She shakes powerfully.)

1876
01:07:29,482 --> 01:07:30,950
What is that by the way?

1877
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,519
(This is not scary. They won't even get close to guessing.)

1878
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,088
Is it a shoe insert?

1879
01:07:36,088 --> 01:07:38,391
(Not at all.)

1880
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:40,393
- Where is it? - Oh, no.

1881
01:07:40,393 --> 01:07:41,594
(She reacts in 2 languages.)

1882
01:07:41,594 --> 01:07:46,265
(Kissing)

1883
01:07:46,532 --> 01:07:52,038
(They can't guess, but their cheeks touch.)

1884
01:07:52,038 --> 01:07:53,039
Goodness.

1885
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,408
(What are they doing?)

1886
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,809
No, no.

1887
01:07:58,144 --> 01:08:00,379
Do better. Make them guess.

1888
01:08:00,413 --> 01:08:02,848
- It's here. - Ji Hyo.

1889
01:08:03,649 --> 01:08:05,184
There.

1890
01:08:05,985 --> 01:08:07,453
You have 30 seconds left.

1891
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,422
- Ji Hyo. - What's this?

1892
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:12,358
- You can't put it in your mouth. - What is she doing?

1893
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:14,260
- Doesn't it smell like feet? - Five,

1894
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,761
- Is it food? - four...

1895
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:19,598
- Ji Hyo and Jennie. - Please guess.

1896
01:08:19,598 --> 01:08:21,033
Two.

1897
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,968
(3 minutes has passed.)

1898
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:24,737
This is too hard.

1899
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,739
- What's your answer? - This is hard.

1900
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:28,074
Hold on.

1901
01:08:29,041 --> 01:08:30,810
My teeth are about to fall out.

1902
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:31,844
Squid?

1903
01:08:31,844 --> 01:08:33,179
- Buttered squid? - What's this?

1904
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:34,647
- Grease. - It's greasy.

1905
01:08:34,914 --> 01:08:37,616
Did they put grease on a shoe insert?

1906
01:08:37,883 --> 01:08:40,086
You're so sharp.

1907
01:08:40,753 --> 01:08:42,421
- Please. - Please.

1908
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:43,589
It's so hard though.

1909
01:08:43,589 --> 01:08:45,424
- I think it's a shoe insert. - Hold on.

1910
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:46,859
It might be food. Fish cake?

1911
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:48,594
Fried fish cake? Fish cake.

1912
01:08:48,594 --> 01:08:49,662
Fish cake.

1913
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:51,330
- Fish cake? It's not. - Squid?

1914
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:52,698
- I have no clue. - What's your answer?

1915
01:08:52,698 --> 01:08:54,533
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

1916
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:56,001
- Fried fish cake. - Fried fish cake.

1917
01:08:56,001 --> 01:09:00,439
(Fried fish cake is incorrect.)

1918
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:03,342
- What was it? - What was it?

1919
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:04,977
- Pig skin. - It was pig skin.

1920
01:09:05,144 --> 01:09:06,812
(What did you say?)

1921
01:09:06,812 --> 01:09:07,880
- Pig skin. - It was pig skin.

1922
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,117
(She's shocked.)

1923
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:14,320
Jennie, are you all right?

1924
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,622
- I've never had it before. - Really?

1925
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,693
- It was her first time trying it. - Jennie reaction was intense.

1926
01:09:20,693 --> 01:09:23,229
- I couldn't have imagined it. - Me neither.

1927
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:24,630
(Team Jennie fails.)

1928
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:26,332
I'm nervous about this.

1929
01:09:26,632 --> 01:09:27,833
Me too.

1930
01:09:27,833 --> 01:09:29,068
This.

1931
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:30,302
Oh, dear.

1932
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:31,704
(So Min and Ki Joo will be guessing Jong Kook's item.)

1933
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:32,872
(What do they have to guess?)

1934
01:09:32,872 --> 01:09:33,939
You won't get this.

1935
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:35,841
- You'll never get this. - This is...

1936
01:09:36,609 --> 01:09:39,111
(They're slightly scared. What is it?)

1937
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:40,212
- What is it? - Ready...

1938
01:09:40,212 --> 01:09:41,313
It's coming.

1939
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:42,782
- Stay still. - Stay still.

1940
01:09:42,782 --> 01:09:43,949
Set...

1941
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:45,351
(If they guess right, they get to fill the penalty list.)

1942
01:09:45,885 --> 01:09:47,620
If you stay still, it'll come down. Stay still.

1943
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,854
Is it here yet?

1944
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:52,425
(It's a sponge.)

1945
01:09:52,425 --> 01:09:53,926
- What's this? - Did something drop?

1946
01:09:53,993 --> 01:09:55,494
- Feel it. - Feel it.

1947
01:09:55,995 --> 01:09:57,596
It's on my head.

1948
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:58,864
What's this?

1949
01:09:58,864 --> 01:10:00,332
- What's this? - Get off!

1950
01:10:00,332 --> 01:10:02,668
- What's this? - It feels weird.

1951
01:10:03,469 --> 01:10:07,640
(They're so thrilled that they do a techno dance.)

1952
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:09,809
(They're such good dancers.)

1953
01:10:09,809 --> 01:10:11,944
You're good dancers. Ki Joo dances well.

1954
01:10:11,944 --> 01:10:13,279
- I can't see. - Where are you, So Min?

1955
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:14,980
- Where are you? You're here. - Ki Joo.

1956
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:16,749
- This item... - It feels rough.

1957
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:18,083
(They hold hands together, and it starts.)

1958
01:10:19,318 --> 01:10:24,190
(The prickly, sponge tango)

1959
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:25,224
It's your hair.

1960
01:10:25,224 --> 01:10:26,792
(There's no time for dancing.)

1961
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:28,093
- This... - You have 15 seconds.

1962
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:29,228
Do you know where it is?

1963
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:31,897
- You have 15 seconds. - It's here. What's this?

1964
01:10:32,131 --> 01:10:34,099
A sponge?

1965
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:35,301
- Is it a sponge? - It's kind of...

1966
01:10:35,301 --> 01:10:36,402
I think it's a sponge.

1967
01:10:36,402 --> 01:10:38,571
(How did she know?)

1968
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:39,939
- I think it's a sponge. - Seven,

1969
01:10:40,139 --> 01:10:41,340
- How do you know? - six,

1970
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,775
- A sponge. - five,

1971
01:10:43,008 --> 01:10:45,411
- 4, 3, - It's kind of big, right?

1972
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,680
- I think it's a sponge. - 2, 1.

1973
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,849
(3 minutes has passed.)

1974
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:51,250
(It is a sponge.)

1975
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,585
- What's your answer? - What do you think it was?

1976
01:10:52,585 --> 01:10:53,886
Don't you think it's a sponge?

1977
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:56,789
(Nodding)

1978
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:58,324
I think it's circular and big.

1979
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:00,493
Why are you nodding when she can't see you?

1980
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:03,796
(Ki Joo, why are you nodding when she can't see you?)

1981
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:06,499
Oh, right. Sorry.

1982
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:08,000
- What's your answer? - 1, 2, 3.

1983
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,968
- A sponge. - A sponge.

1984
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:10,669
(So Min and Ki Joo's answer is a sponge.)

1985
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:11,937
Really?

1986
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,639
- Yes. - Really?

1987
01:11:13,639 --> 01:11:14,907
(Sponge is correct.)

1988
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:17,343
(Team Ki Joo wins round 2 as well. They win the mission.)

1989
01:11:17,343 --> 01:11:19,745
- So Min is good. - You're the best.

1990
01:11:20,179 --> 01:11:22,515
Team Ki Joo wins round two as well.

1991
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:23,849
(They get to fill out the penalty list.)

1992
01:11:23,849 --> 01:11:26,118
Please fill out the penalty list.

1993
01:11:26,118 --> 01:11:27,119
What should we write?

1994
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:28,521
Put the heater on and eat in the car.

1995
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:30,523
Eat jjamppong.

1996
01:11:30,623 --> 01:11:31,790
Do what?

1997
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,359
Put the heater on and eat jjamppong in the car.

1998
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:35,194
- Don't you like jjamppong? - I do,

1999
01:11:35,194 --> 01:11:36,862
- but not the heater. - Turn the heater on...

2000
01:11:36,862 --> 01:11:38,731
Put the heater on and eat jjamppong in the car.

2001
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:40,299
(Let's make sure we win the next mission.)

2002
01:11:40,432 --> 01:11:44,870
(Unlucky Vacation penalties)

2003
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:46,539
The weather is insane.

2004
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,674
- The weather is insane. - Hurry up.

2005
01:11:48,774 --> 01:11:51,010
What's wrong with this weather?

2006
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,044
(They go to the swimming pool for the last mission.)

2007
01:11:52,044 --> 01:11:53,879
I'm dizzy.

2008
01:11:53,879 --> 01:11:55,714
Please let me go in the water.

2009
01:11:55,915 --> 01:11:58,083
If you put meat on the ground, it'll get cooked.

2010
01:11:58,284 --> 01:11:59,852
I'm going to melt.

2011
01:12:00,519 --> 01:12:02,388
Everybody, are you hot?

2012
01:12:02,388 --> 01:12:03,489
- Yes. - Yes.

2013
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,824
This is the last mission of Unlucky Vacation.

2014
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:07,660
It's Battle of Unlucky Round.

2015
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:09,028
(The last mission is Battle of Unlucky Round.)

2016
01:12:09,028 --> 01:12:10,829
- What is it? - It sounds fun.

2017
01:12:11,063 --> 01:12:14,166
Each team has two people who are bombs.

2018
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:18,170
Through a tube stealing game, the team with more bombs left win.

2019
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,773
(There are 2 less tubes than the number of people.)

2020
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:22,341
The bombs have to survive?

2021
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:24,243
- They do. - What's a tube stealing game?

2022
01:12:24,243 --> 01:12:26,679
Each team will be dancing to the music...

2023
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:30,349
and at the whistle, get on a tube.

2024
01:12:30,349 --> 01:12:32,484
If you can't get on the tube, you're out.

2025
01:12:32,484 --> 01:12:35,621
If both bombs are out, your team loses.

2026
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,489
- This is clean. - We have Jong Kook.

2027
01:12:37,823 --> 01:12:40,092
- We have to avoid him. - Okay.

2028
01:12:40,092 --> 01:12:42,661
- There are two bombs in the hats. - What kind of hats are these?

2029
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:44,330
Don't flip it.

2030
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,699
- What kind of hats are these? - There are bombs inside.

2031
01:12:46,699 --> 01:12:48,901
- You do it. - I'll take one.

2032
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:50,369
- Should I take one? - You should.

2033
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:51,737
Okay, I will.

2034
01:12:52,438 --> 01:12:53,939
They might stick to me.

2035
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:56,208
(Team Ki Joo's 1st bomb is Jong Kook.)

2036
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,309
Ki Joo, take the other one.

2037
01:12:57,309 --> 01:12:58,811
I'll take one.

2038
01:12:58,811 --> 01:13:00,379
What if I die?

2039
01:13:00,379 --> 01:13:02,181
Is it okay if I get eliminated early?

2040
01:13:02,948 --> 01:13:05,351
You have to have some strength to get on the tubes.

2041
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:07,353
- Kwang Soo. - Yes, Kwang Soo.

2042
01:13:07,519 --> 01:13:09,788
I'll protect you the best way I can.

2043
01:13:10,222 --> 01:13:11,957
- Ji Hyo or Jennie can take one. - Jennie.

2044
01:13:12,024 --> 01:13:14,460
- I think I'll get eliminated. - It's okay.

2045
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,329
- We'll protect them. - The three of us.

2046
01:13:19,031 --> 01:13:21,900
(The bombs are Ki Joo, Jong Kook, Jennie, and Kwang Soo.)

2047
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,370
This is the 1st round. There are 10 people...

2048
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,305
and eight tubes.

2049
01:13:26,438 --> 01:13:28,574
Music start.

2050
01:13:28,574 --> 01:13:30,209
- Cue. - Start.

2051
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:31,510
(You have to put your bombs on the tubes and not the other team's.)

2052
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:35,714
(This is my song. Let's go, "Dang Diggi Bang".)

2053
01:13:35,848 --> 01:13:38,450
(This is fun.)

2054
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:41,920
(He's energetic, and he's going crazy.)

2055
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:44,790
(Hello, this is Haha of rookie group RPR.)

2056
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:46,091
What are you doing?

2057
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:51,030
(Promoting his song is 100 times more important than the mission.)

2058
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:53,365
He doesn't dance like that. Why is he trying so hard?

2059
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:56,568
(So Min joins him.)

2060
01:13:56,568 --> 01:13:57,836
So Min.

2061
01:13:58,303 --> 01:14:01,073
- Here she is. - So Min joined.

2062
01:14:01,573 --> 01:14:02,941
Let's play.

2063
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:05,110
(This is the highlight.)

2064
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:08,580
(Is this Jamaican?)

2065
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,149
(He's out of breath.)

2066
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:15,821
(The pool is heating up with the reggae party.)

2067
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:18,557
(The game starts.)

2068
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:22,661
(They gather around the tubes on opposite ends.)

2069
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:26,999
(Is that Jong Kook?)

2070
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:28,934
(I'm going to run away.)

2071
01:14:29,101 --> 01:14:30,903
(All 4 people sit down peacefully where Jong Kook is.)

2072
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:32,604
No, no.

2073
01:14:33,038 --> 01:14:36,642
(Chaos breaks out at the tube without Jong Kook.)

2074
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,378
No. No.

2075
01:14:39,378 --> 01:14:40,879
No, no.

2076
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:42,181
Move out of the way.

2077
01:14:42,181 --> 01:14:43,982
(Ki Joo falls into the water.)

2078
01:14:43,982 --> 01:14:46,018
- I am going to climb up. - There is no space.

2079
01:14:46,018 --> 01:14:48,020
- Hey! - 30 seconds remain.

2080
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,189
(So Min and Ki Joo are at a danger of being eliminated.)

2081
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:52,124
So Min, get Jennie!

2082
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:54,359
(So Min charges towards Jennie at the other tube.)

2083
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,928
What should I do?

2084
01:14:56,462 --> 01:14:58,831
- You need to hang in there! - My goodness.

2085
01:14:58,831 --> 01:15:00,532
So Min is scary!

2086
01:15:00,532 --> 01:15:02,101
(The tiger moth is determined.)

2087
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:03,302
Jennie!

2088
01:15:03,302 --> 01:15:06,004
(Jennie can't be eliminated since she is a bomb.)

2089
01:15:06,138 --> 01:15:09,641
Ki Joo, come here!

2090
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:11,210
Ki Joo, come and sit here.

2091
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,845
Hey, So Min.

2092
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:15,581
(Meanwhile, Ki Joo fights hard...)

2093
01:15:15,581 --> 01:15:17,750
(by herself.)

2094
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,218
Hey, Ki Joo!

2095
01:15:19,485 --> 01:15:21,653
(She drags the tube with four men.)

2096
01:15:21,653 --> 01:15:22,888
No!

2097
01:15:22,888 --> 01:15:25,290
Hey, Ki Joo.

2098
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,859
(Ki Joo is about to get eliminated.)

2099
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:29,194
Ki Joo, come here! Come here!

2100
01:15:29,194 --> 01:15:30,829
Ki Joo, come and sit here.

2101
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:32,664
Hey, So Min.

2102
01:15:32,664 --> 01:15:33,999
(Let's pluck Jennie out of the tube.)

2103
01:15:33,999 --> 01:15:36,201
- No! - So Min.

2104
01:15:36,368 --> 01:15:38,470
- In 4, 3, - Come on, Jennie.

2105
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:40,272
- two, - No!

2106
01:15:40,272 --> 01:15:41,740
- one. - Okay.

2107
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:43,142
She did it!

2108
01:15:43,142 --> 01:15:46,512
(Jennie manages to keep her spot.)

2109
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,349
Jeon So Min and Jin Ki Joo are out.

2110
01:15:50,349 --> 01:15:51,750
(Jeon So Min and Jin Ki Joo are out.)

2111
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,519
You need to play harder!

2112
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:55,721
Why is my team so foolish?

2113
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:57,289
- Seok Jin, did you survive? - Yes, I did.

2114
01:15:57,289 --> 01:16:00,459
- The two women are out. - Why didn't you give her your seat?

2115
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:01,860
What?

2116
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:04,630
(Even when Ki Joo was close to getting eliminated, )

2117
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:08,433
(Seok was busy securing his seat.)

2118
01:16:09,234 --> 01:16:14,139
(While the others used their bodies, he used his mouth.)

2119
01:16:14,373 --> 01:16:16,675
(I survived.)

2120
01:16:17,309 --> 01:16:20,579
We will reveal the identities of the two eliminated members.

2121
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:22,181
- Okay. - It's okay.

2122
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:23,549
(She is depressed.)

2123
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:25,417
Ki Joo is out.

2124
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:27,319
(We have one bomb.)

2125
01:16:27,319 --> 01:16:30,022
- We need to get one more. - How could you let this happen?

2126
01:16:30,022 --> 01:16:31,590
You fools!

2127
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,158
I didn't think about that.

2128
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:34,860
- Reveal her identity. - They focused on saving themselves.

2129
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:36,028
I didn't think about...

2130
01:16:36,028 --> 01:16:37,863
- who the bomb is. - Instead of saving the bomb,

2131
01:16:37,863 --> 01:16:39,565
they focused on saving themselves.

2132
01:16:39,731 --> 01:16:40,899
Jong Kook is really angry.

2133
01:16:40,899 --> 01:16:42,968
You should remind me at every mealtime.

2134
01:16:42,968 --> 01:16:44,169
In their team,

2135
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:46,271
(I am forgetful.)

2136
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:49,041
- Jennie is a bomb. - For sure.

2137
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,642
(He is sharp.)

2138
01:16:50,642 --> 01:16:53,478
Ji Hyo offered to give up her seat.

2139
01:16:53,478 --> 01:16:56,381
- Really? - Why didn't our team do that?

2140
01:16:56,381 --> 01:16:59,585
There are 8 people and 6 seats now.

2141
01:17:00,219 --> 01:17:01,954
Music, please.

2142
01:17:01,954 --> 01:17:03,889
(My team loses if I get eliminated in this round.)

2143
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:06,058
(The song is...)

2144
01:17:06,058 --> 01:17:08,293
("Ddu-du Ddu-du" by BLACKPINK.)

2145
01:17:08,293 --> 01:17:09,561
BLACKPINK!

2146
01:17:09,862 --> 01:17:12,531
(When Jennie shoots, )

2147
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:16,235
(the fans shoot together.)

2148
01:17:16,568 --> 01:17:20,439
(The atmosphere is heated up.)

2149
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:25,777
(She suddenly shows a high-quality body roll.)

2150
01:17:25,811 --> 01:17:29,081
(As everyone falls for BLACKPINK's swag, )

2151
01:17:29,081 --> 01:17:31,283
(Round 2 starts.)

2152
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,953
(Jong Kook the bomb gets the tubes.)

2153
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:38,323
(Haha and Seok Jin attack Jennie.)

2154
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:40,058
All right. Keep her away from the tubes.

2155
01:17:40,058 --> 01:17:41,260
Come on.

2156
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:43,629
Jennie must be a bomb.

2157
01:17:43,629 --> 01:17:45,464
Come here, Jennie.

2158
01:17:45,464 --> 01:17:47,866
(Jennie, here are empty tubes.)

2159
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:51,603
(Jennie escapes from the battlefield...)

2160
01:17:51,603 --> 01:17:54,339
(and Haha gets a tube.)

2161
01:17:54,339 --> 01:17:57,042
- All right. - Get your head into the tube.

2162
01:17:57,442 --> 01:17:58,710
Jennie, get into the tube.

2163
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:00,078
Hurry up, Jennie.

2164
01:18:00,078 --> 01:18:02,080
Hurry up and come on in.

2165
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,050
- Okay. - Kwang Soo! Kwang Soo!

2166
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:07,185
(Kwang Soo, come here.)

2167
01:18:09,121 --> 01:18:11,390
In 5, 4,

2168
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:12,891
- three, - Come on.

2169
01:18:12,891 --> 01:18:13,992
- two, - All right.

2170
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:15,060
One.

2171
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,930
(Ji Hyo sacrifices herself to save Se Chan.)

2172
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,965
- Se Chan. - Good job.

2173
01:18:19,998 --> 01:18:22,534
Song Ji Hyo and Yu Jae Seok are out.

2174
01:18:22,868 --> 01:18:25,103
It's a tie now.

2175
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:26,438
Good job.

2176
01:18:26,438 --> 01:18:27,739
What is wrong with you?

2177
01:18:27,739 --> 01:18:28,740
(Haha runs out of energy.)

2178
01:18:28,740 --> 01:18:30,809
(What is wrong with him?)

2179
01:18:30,809 --> 01:18:32,010
What is wrong with him?

2180
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,812
Please play "Dang Diggi Bang" one more time.

2181
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:35,881
"Dang Diggi Bang".

2182
01:18:35,881 --> 01:18:36,949
That's right.

2183
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:38,283
(Only "Dang Diggi Bang" can save Haha.)

2184
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:41,353
(Running...)

2185
01:18:41,353 --> 01:18:43,722
(and bumping into people...)

2186
01:18:43,722 --> 01:18:46,591
(are exhausting for Haha.)

2187
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,860
(Promoting "Dang Diggi Bang" is his medicine.)

2188
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:51,129
It's "Dang Diggi Bang"!

2189
01:18:51,129 --> 01:18:53,231
(Staggering)

2190
01:18:53,498 --> 01:18:55,934
(He suddenly changes.)

2191
01:18:55,934 --> 01:18:59,938
(His energy gets restored when "Dang Diggi Bang" comes on.)

2192
01:19:00,872 --> 01:19:04,309
(The other team is moved by his undying passion.)

2193
01:19:04,309 --> 01:19:06,278
I don't think this song has a dance routine.

2194
01:19:06,812 --> 01:19:08,080
I think it does.

2195
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,082
(Of course there is a dance routine.)

2196
01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:13,518
(Even though it's made-up, it's addictive.)

2197
01:19:13,518 --> 01:19:15,220
It's coming!

2198
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,755
Move out of the way!

2199
01:19:17,022 --> 01:19:18,323
That's it!

2200
01:19:18,323 --> 01:19:20,425
(His passion never goes away.)

2201
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,929
Let's go! Let's go!

2202
01:19:23,929 --> 01:19:26,031
(His energy goes away when his song gets turned off.)

2203
01:19:26,031 --> 01:19:28,300
Now, there are six people...

2204
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,168
and four tubes.

2205
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:33,472
(A bloody battle for the 4 tubes starts.)

2206
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,508
Here he comes.

2207
01:19:36,508 --> 01:19:38,210
No!

2208
01:19:38,410 --> 01:19:39,878
This is driving me crazy.

2209
01:19:39,878 --> 01:19:41,613
(Haha gets eliminated with Se Chan.)

2210
01:19:41,613 --> 01:19:42,914
What?

2211
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:46,785
(Dry heaving)

2212
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,588
(Are you tired? When you are dry heaving...)

2213
01:19:49,588 --> 01:19:51,289
Please play "Dang Diggi Bang".

2214
01:19:51,289 --> 01:19:53,692
Let's have a concert.

2215
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:56,228
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2216
01:19:56,228 --> 01:19:58,997
(It's time for everyone to restore their energy.)

2217
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:02,401
Let's go!

2218
01:20:02,401 --> 01:20:04,569
(He transforms.)

2219
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:06,872
(Shake it, shake it.)

2220
01:20:06,872 --> 01:20:10,142
(He is a reggae zombie.)

2221
01:20:11,143 --> 01:20:12,210
Haha!

2222
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,913
(They say singers' lives follow their songs.)

2223
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:17,716
(Haha jumps until his blood sugar level drops.)

2224
01:20:20,018 --> 01:20:22,454
(Reggae zombie is exhausted.)

2225
01:20:22,454 --> 01:20:24,990
There are four people...

2226
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,458
and two tubes.

2227
01:20:26,458 --> 01:20:28,193
This may be the last round.

2228
01:20:28,193 --> 01:20:30,429
All right. Play the music.

2229
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:32,564
(With 2 tubes, this may be the last round.)

2230
01:20:33,598 --> 01:20:35,434
Go to the right!

2231
01:20:35,434 --> 01:20:36,735
Go to the left!

2232
01:20:37,102 --> 01:20:38,170
Go to the left!

2233
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:40,172
(They move from side to side like they are at a festival.)

2234
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:46,812
(Everyone looks cute and cheerful.)

2235
01:20:46,812 --> 01:20:48,113
Go to the right!

2236
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,348
(It's the whistle sound.)

2237
01:20:50,348 --> 01:20:51,850
(The fight for tubes starts.)

2238
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:52,851
(Landing)

2239
01:20:52,851 --> 01:20:54,286
Come on.

2240
01:20:55,153 --> 01:20:57,055
Jong Kook, hang in there!

2241
01:20:57,189 --> 01:21:00,859
- Flip it. There you go, Jennie. - Jong Kook!

2242
01:21:00,859 --> 01:21:01,960
(They try to flip Jong Kook's tube.)

2243
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:03,261
Be careful. Look behind you.

2244
01:21:03,261 --> 01:21:06,298
Get on the tube.

2245
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:07,966
Get on the tube.

2246
01:21:08,433 --> 01:21:11,002
- Come on. - Did Kwang Soo give up?

2247
01:21:11,303 --> 01:21:13,205
That's right. Get Jennie on the tube.

2248
01:21:13,371 --> 01:21:15,674
In 7, 6,

2249
01:21:15,674 --> 01:21:17,209
- Flip the tube! - five...

2250
01:21:17,209 --> 01:21:20,278
(Kwang Soo succeeds to flip the tube the 2nd time.)

2251
01:21:20,278 --> 01:21:21,980
(Everyone falls into the water.)

2252
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,448
- Get on the tube. - Get on, Jennie.

2253
01:21:23,448 --> 01:21:25,150
- Get on the tube. - You need to get on, Jennie.

2254
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:26,818
- Get on. - What is wrong with him?

2255
01:21:30,021 --> 01:21:31,389
He is holding the tube!

2256
01:21:31,389 --> 01:21:32,757
Get on quickly.

2257
01:21:32,757 --> 01:21:34,192
I am not on the tube yet.

2258
01:21:34,192 --> 01:21:35,560
Get on quickly.

2259
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,728
(He is frightening.)

2260
01:21:36,728 --> 01:21:38,463
- I don't know what to do. - What is going on?

2261
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:40,398
2, 1.

2262
01:21:40,398 --> 01:21:43,568
(Battle of Unlucky Round 4 is over.)

2263
01:21:43,568 --> 01:21:45,270
It's over.

2264
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:47,639
That's good.

2265
01:21:48,373 --> 01:21:50,709
The winner of this round...

2266
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:53,011
could be the final winner.

2267
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:55,013
The score is 1 to 1.

2268
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:57,582
- Jong Kook, I am not worried. - Let's go.

2269
01:21:57,582 --> 01:21:58,950
Music, start.

2270
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,652
(The last round starts.)

2271
01:22:01,453 --> 01:22:04,189
(It's "Twist King" by Turbo.)

2272
01:22:04,823 --> 01:22:08,460
(While everyone has a dance party, )

2273
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,461
(Kwang Soo approaches the tube.)

2274
01:22:09,461 --> 01:22:10,795
That's good.

2275
01:22:12,631 --> 01:22:14,199
Go to the tube.

2276
01:22:14,199 --> 01:22:15,901
(After "Twist King", the match to be the king begins.)

2277
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:17,135
(Hitting)

2278
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:19,304
(Even when a tiger tackles him, )

2279
01:22:19,304 --> 01:22:20,605
(Kwang Soo calmly enters a tube.)

2280
01:22:20,739 --> 01:22:23,108
That's good. That's good.

2281
01:22:23,108 --> 01:22:25,243
Kwang Soo, you got this.

2282
01:22:25,243 --> 01:22:26,711
You are inside the tube.

2283
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:27,879
Kwang Soo.

2284
01:22:27,879 --> 01:22:29,281
30 seconds remain.

2285
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:30,448
My goodness.

2286
01:22:30,448 --> 01:22:31,850
Kwang Soo!

2287
01:22:32,918 --> 01:22:35,720
In 3, 2, 1.

2288
01:22:39,191 --> 01:22:41,760
(Both of them are inside the tube.)

2289
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,228
- What? - One.

2290
01:22:43,929 --> 01:22:45,664
You did well.

2291
01:22:45,664 --> 01:22:47,199
Kwang Soo held on.

2292
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:48,600
Kwang Soo, you did well.

2293
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,768
- Hey. - I am anxious.

2294
01:22:49,768 --> 01:22:51,803
- Kwang Soo, hang in there. - Mom.

2295
01:22:51,803 --> 01:22:53,838
(Mom)

2296
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:55,540
(Mom, he is picking on me.)

2297
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:56,942
Mom.

2298
01:22:57,142 --> 01:22:58,243
Kwang Soo.

2299
01:22:58,243 --> 01:22:59,311
(He looks pitiful.)

2300
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:00,579
Do they have to go again?

2301
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:02,514
This is too much.

2302
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:04,849
Kwang Soo, you did a good job.

2303
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:06,418
Hang in there.

2304
01:23:06,418 --> 01:23:07,519
(Coach Jae Seok is expectant.)

2305
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:09,421
- You can win. - Hang in there.

2306
01:23:09,421 --> 01:23:11,022
- You are almost there. - All right.

2307
01:23:11,022 --> 01:23:12,958
You can do this. Drink some water.

2308
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:14,259
(Let's show them a groundbreaking result.)

2309
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:15,627
I feel bad.

2310
01:23:16,428 --> 01:23:20,198
(Kwang Soo has a timeout.)

2311
01:23:20,198 --> 01:23:22,400
(Do you need a towel?)

2312
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,102
- Let's take this off. - Hold on.

2313
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:26,338
I can't do this.

2314
01:23:26,338 --> 01:23:28,373
(I can't do this.)

2315
01:23:28,373 --> 01:23:30,308
(He withdraws.)

2316
01:23:30,308 --> 01:23:31,810
I lost.

2317
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:32,811
(Running over)

2318
01:23:32,811 --> 01:23:34,246
(Throwing)

2319
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:35,680
I lost.

2320
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,349
(I am giving back the towel.)

2321
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:38,583
You can't do that.

2322
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:42,354
Play the music.

2323
01:23:42,354 --> 01:23:44,122
(The very last round begins.)

2324
01:23:44,122 --> 01:23:45,690
(Red Velvet sings "Red Flavor" for a bloody battle.)

2325
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:46,791
I am curious, honey!

2326
01:23:46,791 --> 01:23:49,561
(Red Velvet sings "Red Flavor" for a bloody battle.)

2327
01:23:49,561 --> 01:23:51,563
(Cute)

2328
01:23:51,563 --> 01:23:53,331
Jennie is good at this.

2329
01:23:53,331 --> 01:23:57,002
(She shows her refreshing charms.)

2330
01:23:57,002 --> 01:23:58,536
She is good.

2331
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:01,306
Please distract Jong Kook.

2332
01:24:01,773 --> 01:24:05,810
(Jennie goes to seduce Jong Kook.)

2333
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,078
Hey!

2334
01:24:07,078 --> 01:24:08,713
Come on.

2335
01:24:08,713 --> 01:24:10,181
Distract Jong Kook.

2336
01:24:10,181 --> 01:24:12,183
- Okay. - Go.

2337
01:24:12,183 --> 01:24:13,618
Jennie, you are doing well.

2338
01:24:13,618 --> 01:24:15,920
(He is distracted.)

2339
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:16,921
You are doing well.

2340
01:24:16,921 --> 01:24:18,790
(Here I come.)

2341
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:20,158
You are doing well.

2342
01:24:20,258 --> 01:24:21,893
(So Min's lethal seduction)

2343
01:24:21,893 --> 01:24:23,995
There goes So Min.

2344
01:24:24,162 --> 01:24:25,263
So Min.

2345
01:24:25,263 --> 01:24:26,331
(Throwing)

2346
01:24:26,331 --> 01:24:30,101
(You are only an annoyance.)

2347
01:24:31,803 --> 01:24:32,871
That's good. That's good.

2348
01:24:32,871 --> 01:24:33,872
(You're so clingy.)

2349
01:24:33,872 --> 01:24:35,573
Jennie, hold onto Jong Kook.

2350
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:37,142
Hold onto him.

2351
01:24:37,142 --> 01:24:38,143
(Please get lost!)

2352
01:24:38,143 --> 01:24:39,210
Hey.

2353
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,979
(Whistling)

2354
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,848
- He picked it up. - He got it.

2355
01:24:43,848 --> 01:24:48,420
(When he's distracted by Jennie, Kwang Soo gets the tube.)

2356
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:53,591
(If he can last in the tube, it will be Kwang Soo's win.)

2357
01:24:54,292 --> 01:24:57,128
(The tiger approaches him as he takes his time.)

2358
01:24:58,163 --> 01:25:00,398
(It's just like the previous round. Then the perfect method is...)

2359
01:25:00,598 --> 01:25:02,334
(forcing himself inside the tube just like the previous round.)

2360
01:25:02,334 --> 01:25:04,469
- No. Not this time. - 5, 4,

2361
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:05,470
3...

2362
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,138
(I can't let him beat me again. I must hold out!)

2363
01:25:07,138 --> 01:25:08,473
- Kwang Soo, a bit more! - Four,

2364
01:25:08,473 --> 01:25:09,708
- No. - three...

2365
01:25:11,943 --> 01:25:13,778
- 3, 2, - He did it.

2366
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:15,013
(He minimizes the space inside the tube.)

2367
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,915
- Yes! - Two...

2368
01:25:17,282 --> 01:25:21,720
(Team Jennie wins the Battle of Unlucky Round.)

2369
01:25:22,554 --> 01:25:25,190
- Kwang Soo did it! - Kwang Soo did it!

2370
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,159
- Kwang Soo did it. - No, it was all Jennie.

2371
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,095
- Jennie did it. - It was all Jennie.

2372
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:31,329
Jennie helped us win.

2373
01:25:31,329 --> 01:25:33,832
The third round goes to Team Jennie!

2374
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:37,736
(Team Jennie wins the whole race of the Unlucky Vacation.)

2375
01:25:38,503 --> 01:25:40,372
We have to wrap it up.

2376
01:25:40,372 --> 01:25:42,240
- Come out now. - Come on out, Haha.

2377
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,309
(There will be a celebratory show according to the order.)

2378
01:25:44,309 --> 01:25:47,312
(Spouting)

2379
01:25:47,312 --> 01:25:50,348
(Let me put on the show for the 4th time.)

2380
01:25:50,548 --> 01:25:51,683
You look so cool!

2381
01:25:51,683 --> 01:25:52,751
(Are you ready to jump?)

2382
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,952
Let's go!

2383
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:58,189
(This reggae zombie dance is back again.)

2384
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,325
Let's go.

2385
01:26:00,792 --> 01:26:04,629
(Is he shaking his bottom?)

2386
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:06,531
(Mr. Lee is a zealous supporter.)

2387
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:10,635
(They do a celebratory gesture for winning the game.)

2388
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:14,139
(This 40-year-old singer uses up his energy when it's 40°C today.)

2389
01:26:14,139 --> 01:26:15,373
Go for it.

2390
01:26:16,508 --> 01:26:20,812
(His passionate celebratory performance is over.)

2391
01:26:20,879 --> 01:26:24,249
The winning team should write down the final penalty.

2392
01:26:24,249 --> 01:26:25,683
- All right. - No one knows who it will be.

2393
01:26:25,683 --> 01:26:26,918
Let's finish up.

2394
01:26:26,918 --> 01:26:30,488
- The last one will be the campfire. - This is crazy.

2395
01:26:30,989 --> 01:26:34,492
Bring in the roulettes now. These are the final roulettes.

2396
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:37,562
We'll begin with drawing a member who will be...

2397
01:26:37,562 --> 01:26:40,198
- exempted from Team Ki Joo. - Ki Joo, you should spin it.

2398
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:41,499
- My gosh. - Spin it hard.

2399
01:26:41,499 --> 01:26:44,269
The member who will be chosen by the roulette...

2400
01:26:44,269 --> 01:26:46,237
won't face the penalty today.

2401
01:26:46,237 --> 01:26:47,839
- Anyway... - One,

2402
01:26:47,839 --> 01:26:49,674
- 2, 3. - Spin it hard.

2403
01:26:50,809 --> 01:26:51,810
Please.

2404
01:26:51,810 --> 01:26:57,549
(Which lucky member will get to avoid the scorching hot penalty?)

2405
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:01,152
It's me. My name is getting close.

2406
01:27:01,152 --> 01:27:02,220
It's Ki Joo.

2407
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:05,590
(Congratulations! Ki Joo is exempted from the penalty.)

2408
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:07,325
This person is exempted.

2409
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:09,828
- It's Ki Joo. - Ki Joo won't face the penalty.

2410
01:27:09,828 --> 01:27:12,230
- Ki Joo is amazing. - She is lucky indeed.

2411
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:14,332
By the way, there are three penalties today.

2412
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:16,100
- My gosh. - How is this possible?

2413
01:27:16,668 --> 01:27:18,770
- Number three is her lucky number. - Exactly.

2414
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:20,638
- This is incredible. - You're really lucky.

2415
01:27:20,638 --> 01:27:22,474
- That's amazing. - Oh, no. I feel bad.

2416
01:27:22,474 --> 01:27:24,342
- My gosh. - All right.

2417
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:26,778
- This person is the unluckiest. - The worst luck.

2418
01:27:26,978 --> 01:27:31,082
Jennie, spin it hard. 1, 2, 3.

2419
01:27:31,149 --> 01:27:38,823
(Which 1 of these members will be the unluckiest?)

2420
01:27:39,123 --> 01:27:41,659
It's Jae Seok! It's Yu Jae Seok!

2421
01:27:41,659 --> 01:27:43,061
- It's Jae Seok! - My gosh.

2422
01:27:43,061 --> 01:27:44,662
- It's Jae Seok. - You're so unlucky.

2423
01:27:44,662 --> 01:27:46,598
- I expected this to happen. - Hey.

2424
01:27:46,598 --> 01:27:49,067
It unfolded just like how we talked about in the car.

2425
01:27:49,501 --> 01:27:51,569
- He's something else. - You're truly the unluckiest.

2426
01:27:51,569 --> 01:27:53,671
Jae Seok will have to carry out the penalty...

2427
01:27:53,671 --> 01:27:55,540
- with Team Ki Joo. - Come here.

2428
01:27:57,642 --> 01:27:59,310
- I'm so sick of these penalties. - My gosh.

2429
01:27:59,310 --> 01:28:01,980
- Why do I always get the penalty? - So Min surely chose a great one.

2430
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:03,381
- Hey, Jong Kook. - Yes?

2431
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:05,149
It's been a while since your last penalty.

2432
01:28:05,149 --> 01:28:07,986
- Exactly. - It's been a while for you.

2433
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:11,122
- It's nice that you're joining us. - Who wants a cup of citrus tea?

2434
01:28:11,122 --> 01:28:12,323
- Me. - I want one, Haha.

2435
01:28:12,323 --> 01:28:13,691
Everyone has to drink one.

2436
01:28:13,691 --> 01:28:15,193
(It's boiling hot citrus tea, good for a sore throat.)

2437
01:28:15,193 --> 01:28:16,528
It's steaming.

2438
01:28:16,528 --> 01:28:18,029
Let's clink our glasses.

2439
01:28:18,363 --> 01:28:19,464
- Let's make this the last time. - Hey.

2440
01:28:19,464 --> 01:28:21,299
Let's think that it's December right now.

2441
01:28:21,299 --> 01:28:23,368
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2442
01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:25,069
- We're so unlucky. - My gosh.

2443
01:28:25,069 --> 01:28:26,104
(As if!)

2444
01:28:26,104 --> 01:28:28,139
- This is too much. - We're boxers who are training...

2445
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:29,340
for matches.

2446
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:30,508
(2nd way of self-hypnosis)

2447
01:28:30,508 --> 01:28:31,709
- Why? - What?

2448
01:28:31,709 --> 01:28:33,678
We'll weigh ourselves an hour later.

2449
01:28:34,312 --> 01:28:37,715
- We must try to lose weight. - I want to fail the weight test.

2450
01:28:38,249 --> 01:28:41,319
- Try to pretend you're a boxer. - I'm sweating buckets.

2451
01:28:41,519 --> 01:28:42,520
Gosh, it's hot.

2452
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,622
(Gosh, it's hot.)

2453
01:28:44,622 --> 01:28:46,090
(What was that? You said you were a boxer.)

2454
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:48,059
- You looked like one of us. - It's hot.

2455
01:28:48,259 --> 01:28:50,128
I've never seen you like this ever since you've been on the show.

2456
01:28:50,128 --> 01:28:52,363
- This is annoying. Why is it hot? - That was funny.

2457
01:28:52,931 --> 01:28:54,899
I guess you can feel it when something is hot.

2458
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:56,768
- Of course. I hate hot things. - He looked like one of us.

2459
01:28:56,768 --> 01:28:58,770
- I thought his skin was iron. - My gosh.

2460
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,738
- I hate hot stuff. - "Jong Kook Was a Human After All".

2461
01:29:00,738 --> 01:29:03,308
- This is so hot. - Gosh, this is delicious.

2462
01:29:03,308 --> 01:29:05,443
My gosh, I finished mine.

2463
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:07,679
- I finished mine. - Me too.

2464
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:09,447
(Their summer vacation was burning hot.)

2465
01:29:10,949 --> 01:29:13,017
(The members of Running Man are invited to a mysterious place.)

2466
01:29:13,551 --> 01:29:15,520
(The moment they set foot inside, )

2467
01:29:16,154 --> 01:29:18,222
(they have been trapped.)

2468
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:21,759
(Someone has mapped out the whole set-up.)

2469
01:29:22,060 --> 01:29:25,129
(A mysterious stranger is observing everything.)

2470
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:29,100
(All of a sudden, the members start to disappear.)

2471
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,669
(If you want to survive, find the architect.)

2472
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:33,538
(The trap is slowly closing in on them.)

2473
01:29:33,538 --> 01:29:36,608
(They must find the architect to end this whole race.)

2474
01:29:37,942 --> 01:29:40,912
(They struggle in order to end this long race.)

2475
01:29:41,079 --> 01:29:44,749
(Who is the architect that planned this whole race?)

2476
01:29:44,782 --> 01:29:45,950
That was it.

2477
01:29:45,950 --> 01:29:47,418
(What's 2 plus 1?)

2478
01:29:47,418 --> 01:29:48,853
(It's 3.)

2479
01:29:49,821 --> 01:29:50,788
What is this?

2480
01:29:50,788 --> 01:29:52,290
(Rock and roll!)

2481
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:53,358
Peace!

2482
01:29:53,358 --> 01:29:55,693
(Suspicious Race)
