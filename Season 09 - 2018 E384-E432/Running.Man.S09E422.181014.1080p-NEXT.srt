1
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:10,530
(P Botanical Garden in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province)

2
00:00:10,533 --> 00:00:11,600
(It's a fall day...)

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,370
(with the bright, morning sunlight.)

4
00:00:15,372 --> 00:00:17,540
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,570
- Hello. - What are Face and Voice?

6
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:21,010
- Hello, Ji Hyo. - Hello.

7
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,510
- Hello. - Anyone would think...

8
00:00:22,512 --> 00:00:24,335
the two of them have a mission.

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,450
(They are dressed like a couple.)

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,980
- What? - Anyone would think...

11
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,350
the two of them have a mission.

12
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:32,620
- That's not true. - There is a concept going on.

13
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:34,190
- That's not true. - That's not true.

14
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,720
This is why there are rumors.

15
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:36,820
We have the same stylist.

16
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,820
- Don't be so blatant. - We have the same stylist.

17
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:40,030
They shouldn't date.

18
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,030
- We have the same stylist. - This is the look she likes.

19
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:44,230
- Don't be ridiculous. - It seriously looks like...

20
00:00:44,234 --> 00:00:45,930
Hong Jin Young and Kim Jong Kook shouldn't date either.

21
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:47,470
(Let me say this, too.)

22
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,570
(Jin Young gets dragged into this.)

23
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,540
Let me say this again. They shouldn't date either.

24
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,440
There is nothing between us. Don't edit this part out.

25
00:00:52,442 --> 00:00:54,210
- Nothing. - The relationship is impossible.

26
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,210
- It's impossible. - Why did you get started so early?

27
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:59,040
- Seok Jin! - Why did you get started so early?

28
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,105
I didn't know Seok Jin wasn't here.

29
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,810
- I didn't know. - Seok Jin wasn't here.

30
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,220
I didn't know either.

31
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,220
Why did you get started so early?

32
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:08,320
Seok Jin shouldn't date either.

33
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:10,460
- What are you talking about? - Seok Jin shouldn't date either.

34
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,220
You will know once you watch the episode.

35
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,130
Will the episode air this week?

36
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,190
- What do you mean? - This episode.

37
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,500
(His eyes shift.)

38
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,630
- What? - I was just curious.

39
00:01:19,636 --> 00:01:22,025
You don't make sense, Seok Jin.

40
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:23,540
- That's no way to talk to an elder. - Listen.

41
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,640
- He's older than you. - You don't need to...

42
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,770
- How could you say that? - rush things because you're late.

43
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,970
- I wasn't rushing things. - Is someone chasing you?

44
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:32,610
He's worried that he might not be in the opening segment.

45
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:33,850
He's being chased.

46
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,050
He's Running Man's Slave Hunter.

47
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,305
- He stays away from talking. - He stays away from talking?

48
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,680
- The moment he opens his mouth, - Fine.

49
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,290
three of you are attacking him.

50
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,520
He can't counterattack them.

51
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,790
(Until the day he's free from his chasers...)

52
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:44,790
Not by himself.

53
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:46,190
(Until the day he's free from his chasers...)

54
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,330
Today,

55
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,830
you'll split into Team Face and Team Voice and have a race.

56
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:53,470
- Team Face and Team Voice? - Face and voice?

57
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,430
Behind you, it's divided into Team Face and Team Voice.

58
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,500
Line up behind the team that you feel confident about.

59
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:02,010
(It's between their faces or voices. They'll choose their own teams.)

60
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:03,480
Well, say no more.

61
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,410
- You should go to Team Voice. - What are you doing?

62
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:06,610
- Go to Team Voice. - Come on.

63
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:08,550
- You should join Team Voice. - Go to Team Voice.

64
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:10,005
I should join Team Face.

65
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,275
Wait, my voice is pretty good too.

66
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,020
(I'm good-looking and have a great voice. What should I do?)

67
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,420
I should go to Team Voice.

68
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,590
My voice is great.

69
00:02:16,593 --> 00:02:19,215
Ji Hyo should stay here. I agree she should be in Team Face.

70
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,330
- Jong Kook and Haha should... - Come on, Se Chan.

71
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,430
- What is it, So Min? - You do belong here.

72
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:25,000
- I'm handsome among comedians. - I belong to Team Voice.

73
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:26,230
- Be quiet. Come here. - Why?

74
00:02:26,236 --> 00:02:29,385
(What are you talking about?)

75
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,300
- Why? - You're talking a load of nonsense.

76
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,910
- Jong Kook, I'm decent, you know. - What?

77
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,865
Hold on. As for your team,

78
00:02:37,213 --> 00:02:39,780
you didn't need to pick based on your looks or voices.

79
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:42,410
- You just followed Jong Kook. - No, no.

80
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:44,150
- He told me to join this team. - That's not true at all.

81
00:02:44,154 --> 00:02:45,780
- I was observing you. - Okay.

82
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:47,920
- Everyone here is for Team Face. - Right.

83
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:49,990
Kwang Soo.

84
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:51,060
- Are you a thug? - Why?

85
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,460
I definitely belong to Team Face.

86
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:53,930
- I totally belong here. - Listen.

87
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,130
I belong to Team Face.

88
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,760
- You belong there. - Good looks are a given for us.

89
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,030
On top of that, we have a great voice.

90
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,200
But he doesn't belong there.

91
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,325
- Mister, come over here. - What?

92
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:04,540
- Come on. Don't you feel guilty? - You're driving me crazy.

93
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,055
- Mister, I belong to Team Face. - Come join us, mister.

94
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,640
- I make people laugh with my face. - What is he talking about?

95
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:13,210
(I make people laugh with my face.)

96
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:15,050
- What? - He's right. It is true.

97
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:16,950
- I just slipped. - He does have a funny-looking face.

98
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:18,220
- That's not what I meant. - You're right.

99
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,890
- I didn't mean to say that. - People do laugh at your face.

100
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,620
I think I might have said the wrong thing.

101
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,320
All right. Hold on. You chose Team Voice, right?

102
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:28,630
- Yes. - You picked Team Voice.

103
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:30,900
- Is everyone here for Team Face? - Yes.

104
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,100
- Wait, Se Chan chose Team Face? - Yes, include me too.

105
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:36,000
All right. You have divided into two teams.

106
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:37,040
(They all choose their teams.)

107
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,640
I will introduce the captains of each team who will lead you today.

108
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,370
(It's time to reveal the captains of the teams.)

109
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,080
- Captain. - I can't wait to find out.

110
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:46,495
- Who's our captain? - It's our team leader.

111
00:03:46,616 --> 00:03:49,610
Team Face's captain, please come on out first.

112
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,220
Gosh, Team Face.

113
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:52,350
- Who is it? - Who is it?

114
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,690
(Who's the captain of Team Face?)

115
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:56,820
(The team called for people who were confident about their looks.)

116
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,060
- It's a woman. - It's just one person.

117
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,885
(Who is the captain of Team Face?)

118
00:04:01,164 --> 00:04:02,590
- Soo Hyang. - It's Soo Hyang.

119
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,900
- Soo Hyang, long time no see. - "My ID Is Gangnam Beauty".

120
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,115
(Im Soo Hyang, an actress with a glorious return)

121
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,070
(She was a former, rising star, and now, she's indispensable.)

122
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:15,540
(6 years ago, she was a gem on this show and won the race.)

123
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,740
(She's thriving beyond genres, both in dramas and on variety shows.)

124
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:22,935
(My ID is Versatile Beauty.)

125
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,720
- Soo Hyang. - Hello.

126
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,350
- That explains the team's name. - It's Soo Hyang.

127
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:28,190
- "My ID Is Gangnam Beauty". - Right.

128
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:30,360
- I'm in Team Face. - By the way, Soo Hyang...

129
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,660
- joined us a long time ago. - It's been so long.

130
00:04:32,662 --> 00:04:33,930
She was my partner.

131
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,785
That's right. It was a special for Pretty Trio.

132
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,930
It's been so long.

133
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,400
- You remember everything. - Of course.

134
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:42,730
- Right. - You're amazing.

135
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:45,340
After that, Soo Hyang returned as a big star.

136
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,570
(We heartily welcome our big star.)

137
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,010
- She's a big star now. - Right.

138
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,910
- I joined you when I was new. - Right.

139
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:52,510
I came back after seven years.

140
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,050
(Today, she's the captain of Team Face.)

141
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,365
Then our show fostered you.

142
00:04:56,953 --> 00:05:00,490
- Our show is fostering you. - It's you.

143
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,820
- How many years has it been? - Please help me a lot.

144
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:04,160
We're almost spoon-feeding you.

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,490
- He's not growing up at all. - He should be walking about now.

146
00:05:06,496 --> 00:05:07,830
He's not growing up.

147
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,930
- I'll do better soon. - My gosh.

148
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,885
- Okay. - We'll continue now.

149
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:14,200
We'll introduce you the captain of Team Voice.

150
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,825
- Who is it? - Please come on out.

151
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:19,125
Don't you think it'd be a man since it's about the voice?

152
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:21,240
- No, I think it's a woman. - Show me your hands first.

153
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:22,440
Show us your hands first. It's a woman.

154
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,780
- That's a lady's hand. - My gosh.

155
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,480
- No, it's a man's hand. - No.

156
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,980
- No. - Is it a guy?

157
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:28,950
She didn't get her nails done.

158
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:31,120
- Isn't that a lady's hand? - Is she getting nervous?

159
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,380
- It's a guy? - Is she nervous?

160
00:05:32,388 --> 00:05:34,320
- It's a lady. Her hand is pretty. - Her hand looks delicate.

161
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:35,520
- Her hand is pretty. - It's a woman.

162
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:40,315
(Who is the mysterious captain of Team Voice?)

163
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,155
- Hello. - Ha Na.

164
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,630
- It's Lee Ha Na. - I get it.

165
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:49,155
- "Voice". The drama, "Voice". - My gosh.

166
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:55,095
(She steals the scenes for fun and is good at sweeping the TV screens.)

167
00:05:55,778 --> 00:05:59,895
(She's the heroine who led to the success of a seasonal drama.)

168
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:02,150
- She's just like her character. - No way.

169
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,380
- "Voice". - She looks the same in person.

170
00:06:03,386 --> 00:06:04,520
(Lee Ha Na appears on Running Man.)

171
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,790
That's why we have Team Face and Team Voice.

172
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,590
- Hello. - Hi.

173
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,090
"Voice". I'm a hot fan of you.

174
00:06:12,095 --> 00:06:14,460
(This turns into a fan meet all of a sudden.)

175
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,660
What's a "hot fan"?

176
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:16,930
- What is that word? - A hardcore fan.

177
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,300
- A hardcore fan. - The biggest fan.

178
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,970
- Thank you. I'm a fan too. - We say a hardcore fan.

179
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,270
She can even hear the smallest sounds.

180
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:25,195
Seok Jin, don't fart in secret today.

181
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,840
- She can hear everything. - She hears even the smallest sound.

182
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:29,940
(Stay tuned to find out Ha Na's performance with her super hearing.)

183
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:32,380
- Let's do short introductions. - Okay.

184
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:34,650
Could you say hello to the viewers?

185
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:36,050
- Okay. Hello. - Okay.

186
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:37,450
(Looking shy)

187
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:40,050
I'm Actress Lee Ha Na. It's my first time on Running Man.

188
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:42,650
I've been supporting Running Man for a long time.

189
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,960
- Really? - Yes.

190
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,190
- Her voice is so sweet. - My gosh.

191
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:47,460
- She has such a great voice. - I knew it.

192
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:51,230
I'll tell you my favorite episode.

193
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:52,400
- Okay. - Please tell us.

194
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,900
The one with Kwang Soo's fan.

195
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:56,500
- It was a long time ago. - Yes.

196
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,740
- Really? - Yes.

197
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,940
The Namyang Middle School episode?

198
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,310
I know. We found her with a photo.

199
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,940
- That's right. - We visited schools too.

200
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:04,880
We even went to houses too.

201
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,250
That's when Kwang Soo wasn't popular. He really wasn't.

202
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,750
- You know what? - That's so true.

203
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,720
It was when Kwang Soo had three fans.

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,780
- Don't be so mean. - I know this very well...

205
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,250
because his three fans used to criticize me a lot back then...

206
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,015
for teasing Kwang Soo.

207
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:21,815
It was fun to watch, but it was also touching.

208
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,290
You like touching episodes.

209
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:26,100
I can't believe Ha Na pointed out a specific episode.

210
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:29,225
Have you seen the Sherlock Holmes Special?

211
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:30,370
That's one fantastic episode.

212
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:32,170
- I don't remember that one. - You haven't watched that one?

213
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,655
(Trailing off)

214
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,540
- Seok Jin ruined that episode. - Looking at your eyes, it seems...

215
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:39,535
as if you just found out that Seok Jin is on Running Man.

216
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,305
- She's a fan of Running Man. - I'm a huge fan.

217
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:45,820
- It's our ninth year. - Right.

218
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,190
The viewers are just getting to know him.

219
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,320
He's a new recruit to our show.

220
00:07:49,325 --> 00:07:51,015
- I'm a new recruit. - For nine years?

221
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,930
People are commenting that he's funny now. It just happened.

222
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,785
Finally, he's getting a lot of hateful comments now.

223
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,900
- People are interested now. - He never got those comments,

224
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:00,770
and people commented that he wasn't entertaining,

225
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,970
- but now, people criticize him. - Seriously.

226
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,485
Criticisms about me fill up an entire page.

227
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:05,040
People are giving you attention now.

228
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,210
Every week, I'm swimming in an ocean full of hateful comments.

229
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:12,080
Finally, Seok Jin is in the center of funny jokes.

230
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:15,505
I'd like to ask the viewers to look forward to his performance.

231
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:19,420
All right. Recently, the second season of "Voice" ended.

232
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,190
- That's right. - Yes, it did.

233
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,060
Please tell us how you feel about finishing the drama.

234
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,545
Well, I mean this.

235
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,730
- I'm grateful. - Okay.

236
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,715
Actually, for the second season to be successful...

237
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,400
That rarely happens. That's not easy to accomplish.

238
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,500
- You want to say yours did well. - We should have mentioned that.

239
00:08:34,504 --> 00:08:35,670
(The 2nd season was a hit too.)

240
00:08:35,671 --> 00:08:37,270
- That wasn't an easy thing to do, - Yes.

241
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:38,795
but yours did well.

242
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,100
- Is that your point? - "I am..."

243
00:08:40,109 --> 00:08:42,065
"I am amazing."

244
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:43,310
"I did it."

245
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,380
(You're amazing, Ha Na.)

246
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,865
"You can't pull this off."

247
00:08:46,849 --> 00:08:48,680
- This is how you do things here. - That's right.

248
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:50,665
- I should watch my tongue. - Right.

249
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,020
On top of that,

250
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,320
one of the main leads was switched out during the season.

251
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:56,845
- This isn't an easy thing to do. - "I'm the only one who wasn't cut."

252
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:59,390
- I accomplished that hard task. - Right.

253
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:00,985
You did it.

254
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:03,145
You pulled off that hard task.

255
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:05,400
- She doesn't hold back. - She's so cute.

256
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:08,070
- I really want to do a good job. - Seriously.

257
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,570
- I don't want to be shy today. - That's great.

258
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,640
- Ha Na, that's trending nowadays. - That's right.

259
00:09:12,642 --> 00:09:15,410
- People toot their own horns now. - You have a point.

260
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:18,065
- Being modest isn't a virtue now. - Exactly.

261
00:09:18,581 --> 00:09:20,380
Next up is "My ID Is Gangnam Beauty".

262
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,335
Let me introduce you to Im Soo Hyang.

263
00:09:22,485 --> 00:09:26,320
- Hello, I'm Im Soo Hyang. - She's really nice.

264
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,545
- Her drama just ended. - Exactly.

265
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:32,815
I came here after doing a great job on "My ID Is Gangnam Beauty".

266
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:35,230
(She smoothly starts promoting herself.)

267
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,985
- She tooting her own horn now. - Right.

268
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,730
- Being modest isn't a virtue. - That's right.

269
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:41,570
- You took a page from Ha Na's book. - I'm following that.

270
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:44,570
Anyway, Soo Hyang is joining us today.

271
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,940
Here's what's important.

272
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:47,810
- We have to split into teams. - That's right.

273
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,365
Ha Na, for your teammates,

274
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:53,140
- you have Jong Kook and Haha. - You must feel reassured.

275
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:56,605
Soo Hyang, you have members who are confident about their looks.

276
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:58,450
- That's right. - You're confident about your looks?

277
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:01,290
- We all chose this team. - I think she's laughing at me.

278
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,345
- No, no. - The moment she saw me...

279
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,690
No, no.

280
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,090
- The moment she saw me... - You bring laughter with your face.

281
00:10:06,095 --> 00:10:07,660
- Let me explain. - That's what you do.

282
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:10,190
I'm confident about my looks in many ways.

283
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:12,000
- You can't change your face. - Right.

284
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:13,870
Don't feel like she's kicking you out.

285
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,970
You have no choice but to form your own team, Soo Hyang.

286
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:18,070
Make your decisions just based on their looks.

287
00:10:18,074 --> 00:10:19,270
(Two of them will join Team Voice.)

288
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:20,740
Just decide based on our faces.

289
00:10:20,743 --> 00:10:22,410
- Faces? Based on your faces? - I'm serious.

290
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:23,610
It's Team Face after all.

291
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:25,880
In that case, there's someone who totally suits the theme.

292
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,080
Who is it?

293
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,250
Should I tell you?

294
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,335
- She looked at me for a second. - Just do it based on their looks.

295
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,520
I'm sure she looked at Seok Jin too.

296
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,920
- He's just dodging her eyes. - I didn't look at her.

297
00:10:33,923 --> 00:10:35,120
- Soo Hyang. - I won't look at her.

298
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:37,560
There's an official game we play at times like this.

299
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,720
- We can play the Race of Wits. - Come on, don't do that.

300
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:41,660
How about sending the loser to the other team?

301
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:43,730
- Should we play that? - Shall we play that?

302
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,330
- We'll start. - He loves the game.

303
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,200
- I don't have to play, right? - Of course not.

304
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:49,200
Hold on. I'm not sure if I saw this right.

305
00:10:49,205 --> 00:10:51,340
When Jong Kook lifted his arm, you put your shoulder there.

306
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,500
I wasn't imagining this, right?

307
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:55,065
What did you say?

308
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,980
- Did he really do that? - When Jong Kook lifted his arm,

309
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,735
you walked and put your shoulder there. I'm not wrong, am I?

310
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,605
Isn't this how things should be?

311
00:11:02,685 --> 00:11:04,205
You really did that?

312
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,180
(When they were about to start the Race of Wits...)

313
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,990
(Coming closer)

314
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:11,915
(His shoulder-leaning service takes initiatives.)

315
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,720
Why did you put your shoulder there?

316
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:15,830
I act as his keychain and armrest.

317
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:17,090
- Is that so? - Yes.

318
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:20,200
I thought I was imagining it. I'm sorry.

319
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,700
We have our arrangements you don't know about.

320
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:24,470
- There's an arrangement. - If I'm fine, everything all right.

321
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:25,740
(He defends himself.)

322
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:26,900
Of course.

323
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:29,095
I was just wondering if I was seeing things.

324
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,180
He has a point.

325
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,380
All right.

326
00:11:32,381 --> 00:11:34,280
The loser will be sent to the other team.

327
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:36,335
- Okay. - I'll stay here.

328
00:11:36,352 --> 00:11:39,580
(Who will leave Team Face?)

329
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:40,890
Start.

330
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,745
One.

331
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:46,560
- 2. - 3.

332
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:47,930
Four.

333
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,200
(Ji Hyo and Seok Jin are the only ones left.)

334
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,585
Five.

335
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,470
- 2. - 3.

336
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:57,270
(Hesitating)

337
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:59,340
(In the end, he says, "five".)

338
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,440
(Gosh)

339
00:12:01,444 --> 00:12:05,010
- Why didn't you sit down? - He was confusing me.

340
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:07,240
(Ha Na welcomes Ji Hyo.)

341
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:08,450
Ji Hyo lost.

342
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:09,580
Come here.

343
00:12:09,585 --> 00:12:10,920
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

344
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,950
Ji Hyo.

345
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:13,250
(Welcome, Ji Hyo.)

346
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:15,490
I was hoping she'd come to our team.

347
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,790
- Really? - That's great.

348
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:19,490
Ji Hyo was sent to the other team.

349
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:21,760
- The second... - Should Soo Hyang push someone?

350
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:22,830
Should we do that?

351
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:24,500
- She should push someone. - That sounds good.

352
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,100
She'll push someone she wants to kick out.

353
00:12:26,102 --> 00:12:27,370
But the other team might reject that person.

354
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,870
- Right. - If you're too ugly, we'll refuse.

355
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:33,100
- All right. - I think So Min is safe.

356
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:34,440
(Who will be the second person to leave Team Face?)

357
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:36,870
What should I do? Whom should I choose?

358
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:39,635
- She touched me. - What should I do?

359
00:12:39,782 --> 00:12:42,250
- She touched my back. - Mine too.

360
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:44,720
Some of them look worried.

361
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,020
(Worried)

362
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,875
Why is she lingering behind me?

363
00:12:47,923 --> 00:12:49,890
I think she's behind me.

364
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,860
(Who will Captain Soo Hyang choose?)

365
00:12:51,861 --> 00:12:53,120
It doesn't feel right.

366
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:54,330
Is it me?

367
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,730
It doesn't feel right.

368
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:56,730
Is it me?

369
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,155
(Pushing)

370
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:02,555
(I knew it was coming.)

371
00:13:03,572 --> 00:13:05,395
(Should we accept him?)

372
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,995
She must hate him.

373
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,040
Let me just go home then.

374
00:13:10,046 --> 00:13:12,080
- Let me go home. - Stay.

375
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:14,150
Don't feel offended. She likes you.

376
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,750
Se Chan.

377
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,150
It's okay.

378
00:13:17,153 --> 00:13:19,350
You're getting more parts.

379
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:20,775
What?

380
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:22,945
(He's been kicked out, but he gets more parts.)

381
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,490
(Ha Na holds Se Chan's hand.)

382
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:27,730
- Yes! - I...

383
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,260
- Is it done? - Yes.

384
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:30,845
Se Chan.

385
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,230
Okay.

386
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:33,600
I wanted you to come here.

387
00:13:33,602 --> 00:13:36,870
- Okay. - Team Face.

388
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,440
- We're the penalty members. - That's right.

389
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,240
What do you mean?

390
00:13:41,243 --> 00:13:43,865
We're all so unlucky. Totally.

391
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:47,750
Team Face and Team Voice will compete...

392
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,550
in the Legendary Captain Race.

393
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:51,120
(Legendary Captain)

394
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,275
The Legendary Captain Race.

395
00:13:53,322 --> 00:13:55,090
After three rounds,

396
00:13:55,091 --> 00:13:57,860
the team with more money left will win.

397
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,720
The winning team will get a prize,

398
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,630
and the losing team will be penalized.

399
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,760
I can already see.

400
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:04,900
But the member with the most money...

401
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,800
in the losing team won't be penalized.

402
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:10,940
The member with the least money in the winning team...

403
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,695
will be penalized.

404
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:15,065
I want to go to that team.

405
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,370
This team will definitely...

406
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:18,410
We'll...

407
00:14:18,414 --> 00:14:19,910
They'll definitely be penalized.

408
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,905
(What will happen to Team Face?)

409
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:25,450
- Captain, let's do this. - Let's do this.

410
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,890
Do you like your captains?

411
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,990
- Yes. - Of course.

412
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,060
I just want our captains to like us.

413
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,560
The captains will distribute money among us, right?

414
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,130
- Yes. - Yes.

415
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:37,900
- Okay. - Captain, I'll work hard.

416
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay.

417
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,560
I'll be watching you.

418
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:41,670
(Let me see who works hard.)

419
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,670
Of course.

420
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,270
- We'll do well. - We will.

421
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,100
- Right. - When we started shooting,

422
00:14:47,109 --> 00:14:48,240
Ha Na said,

423
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:49,910
"I'm ready."

424
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,580
(She's eager.)

425
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,350
I heard it too.

426
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,610
For this race,

427
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:59,680
you can change the captain who has absolute power.

428
00:14:59,688 --> 00:15:01,590
(The captain can be changed.)

429
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,350
You can do it through a vote.

430
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,360
What?

431
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,715
(They can secretly vote?)

432
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:07,930
The captains should...

433
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,360
- be careful too. - They should be nice to us.

434
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:11,300
If you want to be the captain,

435
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,960
write your name on a ballot...

436
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:17,030
and give it to a cameraman.

437
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,640
When the captain changes,

438
00:15:19,642 --> 00:15:22,340
the old captain and the new captain will switch their accounts.

439
00:15:22,344 --> 00:15:23,470
Oh, my.

440
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,280
Those who voted yes...

441
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:28,135
get to see their balances.

442
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:31,250
We'll be voting many times.

443
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,880
(They're all ambitious.)

444
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:34,920
There will be many votes.

445
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,375
(The most suspected member feels guilty.)

446
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,560
(I'm getting worried.)

447
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,115
Gosh.

448
00:15:40,563 --> 00:15:41,860
Kwang Soo, you already wrote your name?

449
00:15:41,864 --> 00:15:44,445
(Is he already voting?)

450
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,300
What's that in your right hand?

451
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:47,300
(What's in his right hand?)

452
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:49,570
He folded his ballot.

453
00:15:49,572 --> 00:15:51,795
(He's already holding a ballot.)

454
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:53,500
(No way.)

455
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:54,840
- That's right. - He's already holding it.

456
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:56,140
He's holding it in his hand.

457
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,880
What?

458
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,865
(When did the ballot get into his hand?)

459
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,320
(As soon as he found out he could vote,)

460
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,120
(he took out a ballot.)

461
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:08,475
(Please take it.)

462
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,250
(He pretends to be innocent.)

463
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,945
What's wrong? Why are you ripping it up?

464
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:15,930
(So Min makes sure Kwang Soo can't vote.)

465
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,130
Why did you rip it up?

466
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:20,230
- You... - You're out.

467
00:16:20,236 --> 00:16:21,470
- Captain Im. - Let me explain.

468
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,070
- Captain Im. - Thank you.

469
00:16:23,072 --> 00:16:24,070
Did you see that?

470
00:16:24,073 --> 00:16:25,440
- I did it just in case. - Okay.

471
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay. I saw it.

472
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:28,940
- Remember it. - I will.

473
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:29,970
Good.

474
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:31,880
- You don't understand. - When did you write your name?

475
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,265
(Captain, you don't understand.)

476
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:35,635
Kwang Soo is lying over there.

477
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,375
- That's right. - Kwang Soo is lying over there.

478
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
So Min, Kwang Soo is lying over there.

479
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,275
Kwang Soo!

480
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,890
Kwang Soo!

481
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:44,890
(What are you talking about?)

482
00:16:44,893 --> 00:16:46,515
Kwang Soo is lying over there.

483
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:48,830
(The wooden sculpture looks exactly like Kwang Soo.)

484
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:50,515
That looks exactly like Kwang Soo.

485
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,830
Kwang Soo.

486
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:54,400
Even the hair is long on the back of the head.

487
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:55,970
It doesn't look like me at all.

488
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,130
It looks like Kwang Soo.

489
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:58,270
Look at the legs.

490
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,040
It looks exactly like Kwang Soo.

491
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,310
Even the legs are thin.

492
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,740
No way.

493
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,880
It doesn't look like me at all.

494
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,810
- It does. - The hairstyle looks the same.

495
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,935
The profile looks the same too.

496
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,410
The hairstyle looks exactly the same.

497
00:17:10,419 --> 00:17:11,950
Before the first mission,

498
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:15,620
you need to take out a loan to make a bet.

499
00:17:15,624 --> 00:17:17,390
But the conditions are a bit complicated.

500
00:17:17,393 --> 00:17:18,760
(They need to take out a loan before each mission.)

501
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,060
(What are the loan conditions?)

502
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,290
For the first loan, you have to use your face.

503
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,700
Wrap Monster.

504
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,730
Wrap Monster?

505
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,000
(Wrap Monster)

506
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,555
The number of plastic wraps each captain breaks through...

507
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:32,970
within the given time multiplied by five...

508
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,100
will be the amount you can borrow.

509
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,895
With your face.

510
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:38,080
(That sounds harsh.)

511
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,980
We should protect their beauty.

512
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:42,350
We just need to break through?

513
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:44,850
(The captain gets worked up.)

514
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:46,550
Ha Na is all worked up.

515
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:47,890
- Her eyes are glowing. - She's very competitive.

516
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,375
Her eyes are glowing.

517
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:51,990
- Will you be okay? - Will you be okay?

518
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,560
I've never tried it, so I don't know.

519
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,915
Well...

520
00:17:56,465 --> 00:17:57,985
Forehead?

521
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
I don't know.

522
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:01,270
- Use your forehead. - Okay.

523
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,370
Forehead?

524
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:03,830
(She heard it?)

525
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,240
You heard it?

526
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,470
Just like in "Voice".

527
00:18:06,475 --> 00:18:07,840
She's from "Voice".

528
00:18:07,843 --> 00:18:08,910
She can hear everything.

529
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:10,370
His voice was very low. How did she hear it?

530
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:11,980
- How did you hear it? - She can hear everything.

531
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
How did she hear it?

532
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,150
- Don't even think of whispering. - Gosh.

533
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,910
There was Sommers in the 1980s.

534
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:19,205
- In the 2000s, we have "Voice". - Sommers.

535
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:21,845
- She can hear everything. - Oh, I know what that is.

536
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,650
Ha Na will go first.

537
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:24,890
- You have 30 seconds. - Okay.

538
00:18:24,893 --> 00:18:26,320
Break through as many as you can.

539
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:27,390
Stay calm.

540
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:28,630
- It might be harder than you think. - It might be harder than you think.

541
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,660
It's hard.

542
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:31,330
We get 50 dollars per plastic wrap.

543
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,155
Ready, start.

544
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,900
Yes. Like that.

545
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:39,070
(She is determined.)

546
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,800
- That's not okay. - There you go.

547
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,410
- It doesn't count. - It's okay.

548
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:43,410
It doesn't count.

549
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:45,880
- One. Continue. - Continue.

550
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,340
Continue. Okay.

551
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,780
Good.

552
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,135
Two. Good.

553
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,320
- Three. - Good.

554
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,375
I'm in trouble. What should I do?

555
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:57,760
(Her facial ability is amazing too.)

556
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,460
- She's so determined. - Put it down.

557
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,775
Put it down.

558
00:19:00,863 --> 00:19:01,930
No.

559
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,490
(She really is a wrap monster.)

560
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:04,900
Please stop.

561
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,715
Stop!

562
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,300
Stop!

563
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:10,885
Please stop!

564
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,470
Bring some more!

565
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:13,640
Ha Na.

566
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:15,795
(She doesn't hesitate.)

567
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:17,570
Oh, my gosh. I can't do that.

568
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,980
Good.

569
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:21,295
She's so fast. Good.

570
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,780
What should we do?

571
00:19:22,785 --> 00:19:23,810
(The captain of Team Voice is full of determination.)

572
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:25,920
- My goodness. - Okay.

573
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:28,820
(Ha Na has broken through 8 plastic wraps.)

574
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:29,890
Okay!

575
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:32,260
Ha Na, you're amazing!

576
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,490
That was incredible.

577
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,830
You were amazing.

578
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,830
(The team members are touched.)

579
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,900
Ha Na looked so sad.

580
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,200
We saw it many times.

581
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:41,270
- Her lips were rolled. - It was amazing.

582
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,270
We should make them into emoticons.

583
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:44,840
- You were amazing. - Will I be able to get married?

584
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,070
Of course.

585
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,910
We won't have to change our captain.

586
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:50,965
- Soo Hyang. Come on! - You can do this!

587
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,410
- Captain. - I've never tried it.

588
00:19:52,414 --> 00:19:53,940
(What should I do?)

589
00:19:53,949 --> 00:19:55,680
- Ready. - I think it'll be hard.

590
00:19:55,684 --> 00:19:57,665
Check the angle.

591
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,850
Watch from the front. You have to use your face.

592
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,620
- Ready. - 1, 2.

593
00:20:01,623 --> 00:20:03,590
(Soo Hyang starts.)

594
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:05,390
- Good. - I can't do this!

595
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:06,690
Break through!

596
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:08,130
(She puts her head in,)

597
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,090
(but she can't get out.)

598
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:11,800
- I can't do this! - Break through!

599
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,530
Break through!

600
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:14,770
Soo Hyang!

601
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,070
- Hey! - Where are you going?

602
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:18,070
- Hey! - Okay.

603
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:19,140
Hey!

604
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:21,310
You have to do it!

605
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,640
- Break through! - Break through!

606
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,670
Break it!

607
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay!

608
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,810
(They're no match for us.)

609
00:20:25,814 --> 00:20:27,295
- Break it! - Break through!

610
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:29,180
(She finally breaks 1.)

611
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,450
Soo Hyang, hurry up.

612
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,320
Use your forehead.

613
00:20:32,321 --> 00:20:34,380
- This is the second one. - It's too hard.

614
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,220
Use your forehead.

615
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:37,905
- Soo Hyang! - What are you doing?

616
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,260
Why is she so bad?

617
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:41,475
They'll definitely change their captain.

618
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,530
- Soo Hyang! - Hold on.

619
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:44,545
Break it!

620
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,460
(Soo Hyang breaks 3 within 30 seconds.)

621
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:50,685
- Let's change our captain! - How did you do it?

622
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:52,140
Ha Na did an amazing job.

623
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,595
(It just worked.)

624
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:56,110
- Lee Ha Na! - Lee Ha Na!

625
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:58,880
- She's good. - How did you do it?

626
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,440
- Soo Hyang. - Let's change captains!

627
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:01,550
It...

628
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,410
(So Min has an idea.)

629
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,580
(She attacks Kwang Soo.)

630
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:09,520
(She picks a fight.)

631
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:10,905
Soo Hyang!

632
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,115
I did my best.

633
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:17,015
I can't believe this. I don't like our captain.

634
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,300
(It's an artwork.)

635
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,055
Stop it!

636
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,770
- Stop it. - Kwang Soo...

637
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,300
Which one is Kwang Soo?

638
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,040
My face got squished, so it looks ugly.

639
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,340
I'll pay three dollars for it.

640
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,110
- I'll pay three dollars for it. - What do you mean?

641
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,770
- Let's start at three dollars. - No.

642
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:31,980
I don't look like this.

643
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,510
- 10 dollars. - 10 dollars?

644
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:35,250
- We have 10 dollars. - 15 dollars.

645
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,810
- We have 15 dollars. - 15 dollars.

646
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,720
- 20 dollars. - We have 20 dollars.

647
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,020
- 25 dollars. - 30 dollars.

648
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,620
That's not me. I don't look like that.

649
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:44,490
- 20 dollars. - We have 20 dollars.

650
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:47,220
- Why? - We have 30 dollars.

651
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,760
- 50 dollars. - 50...

652
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:50,630
(I call 50 dollars.)

653
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:53,330
(The original artist participates in the auction as well.)

654
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:54,970
(His competitors are nervous.)

655
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:57,125
- 70 dollars. - 50 dollars?

656
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:59,240
- 70 dollars. - 70? Sold!

657
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,700
(He didn't want to lose.)

658
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:02,410
- I don't want it. - 70? Sold.

659
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:03,610
("Face Off" gets sold to Seok Jin for 70 dollars.)

660
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:04,680
Here you go.

661
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,880
(Jae Seok ends the auction abruptly.)

662
00:22:05,881 --> 00:22:08,450
- Hey. - 70 dollars.

663
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,650
(They all congratulate him.)

664
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,950
- Congratulations. - You took it from me.

665
00:22:11,954 --> 00:22:14,920
- 70 dollars. - This is not how auctions work.

666
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:17,960
Somebody was supposed to call 80 dollars.

667
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,790
- This is not a proper auction. - Sold at 70 dollars.

668
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:22,330
Gosh, I wanted it too.

669
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:24,290
- This is not a proper auction. - Sold at 70 dollars.

670
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:27,700
- Hand it to your manager. - His face got printed really well.

671
00:22:27,703 --> 00:22:31,640
Captains, you need to decide under whose name...

672
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,940
you'll get a loan.

673
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,310
Soo Hyang, I have something to show you.

674
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,810
What are you going to show me?

675
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:38,780
- I'll give you my trust. - I'll try my best.

676
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,340
You can watch me.

677
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:41,680
I trust you.

678
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:44,820
I broke through two earlier, and somebody wasn't happy with me.

679
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,320
- He said "I don't like my captain." - That was Seok Jin.

680
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:49,290
- That wasn't me. - I didn't say a word.

681
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:50,790
Okay.

682
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:51,790
No, I didn't.

683
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,060
Is there anything you'd like to say?

684
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:55,430
- Don't feel pressured. - Will you trust me?

685
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,490
- Yes. - I trust you.

686
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,600
- I trust you. - I trust you a lot.

687
00:22:59,601 --> 00:23:02,070
We'll do our best with the games.

688
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,740
- We'll win. - Right? We can win.

689
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,240
All right.

690
00:23:06,241 --> 00:23:08,295
(Under whose names will the captains get a loan?)

691
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,470
Let's go, Soo Hyang.

692
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:11,980
Captain Im, I trust you.

693
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,580
- I'm serious. - Captain Im.

694
00:23:13,582 --> 00:23:16,550
I think Soo Hyang is the prettiest actress out there.

695
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:19,050
I was shocked at how pretty she was.

696
00:23:19,054 --> 00:23:22,645
I was amazed. She's unbelievable.

697
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,960
- I can borrow 150 dollars, right? - Yes.

698
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,020
Then...

699
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:28,960
(Team Face can borrow 150 dollars.)

700
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:35,125
(She can also distribute the loan to the team members of her choice.)

701
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,840
There's a person who said he didn't like the team captain.

702
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,095
(One of our team members said that.)

703
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:47,995
(Seok Jin yelled, "Let's change our captain.")

704
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,850
Put everything under Seok Jin.

705
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:56,675
(Seok Jin didn't like the team captain.)

706
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:00,060
There'll be other chances.

707
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:01,960
She's done. There's our team captain.

708
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:03,530
- Are you done? - Yes.

709
00:24:03,532 --> 00:24:05,100
You are sharp, Captain Im.

710
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,960
- She didn't hesitate. - Everybody will be satisfied.

711
00:24:07,969 --> 00:24:09,470
You'll all be satisfied.

712
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:11,825
- Did you distribute it equally? - All right.

713
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,100
- I trust you. - Do you?

714
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:15,440
- Yes. - I see.

715
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:17,070
(She keeps a poker face.)

716
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,410
- I can't tell. - I don't know what she's thinking.

717
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,980
- I don't know at all. - I have no idea.

718
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:25,420
How much can I borrow? 450 dollars? 400.

719
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,720
(Team Voice can withdraw 400 dollars.)

720
00:24:26,722 --> 00:24:27,880
(Including me...)

721
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,675
There are five of us.

722
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,760
Wait. I think she's deep in thought.

723
00:24:32,761 --> 00:24:34,220
I said I'll give it my all today.

724
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:35,930
She's the type of person who goes with her gut.

725
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:36,930
Exactly.

726
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:39,130
Then I'll do this first.

727
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:40,560
Okay.

728
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:42,370
We're going to win in games.

729
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,130
(She's convinced they'll win in games.)

730
00:24:44,139 --> 00:24:45,140
(Whom did she give 400 dollars to debt to?)

731
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,140
The loans have been processed.

732
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:49,340
Here's the first mission to win some cash prize.

733
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:51,580
It's called Sleeping Bag Express 999 Karaoke.

734
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,080
(First mission: Sleeping Bag Express 999 Karaoke)

735
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:55,150
- "Sleeping Bag Express"? - "Sleeping Bag"...

736
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,850
- Sleeping bags? - Sleeping bags.

737
00:24:56,852 --> 00:25:00,580
Each team will put on sleeping bags that are connected front to back.

738
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:03,590
Listen to the song lyrics we'll read to you...

739
00:25:03,592 --> 00:25:05,460
and guess the song title and the singer.

740
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,230
The team that takes the microphone...

741
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,030
gets to guess first.

742
00:25:10,031 --> 00:25:13,330
Each captain should bet money first.

743
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:15,300
If we win, we can get two times the amount we bet.

744
00:25:15,303 --> 00:25:17,330
- That's right. - We have to consider that.

745
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:19,940
We can get two times the amount we bet, right?

746
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:21,810
They might bet everything they have,

747
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,240
because they can borrow more.

748
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:25,880
They're impulsive, so they might bet everything.

749
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:28,250
- 150 dollars. - We have 150 dollars.

750
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,550
How much shall we bet?

751
00:25:29,551 --> 00:25:31,110
(Farting)

752
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,920
(He farts suddenly.)

753
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:35,920
- He farted. - What are you doing?

754
00:25:35,924 --> 00:25:38,160
- That sounded like a frog. - This is awful.

755
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,960
Who was that?

756
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,760
He was startled too.

757
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:43,130
- He farted and... Goodness. - Hey.

758
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,300
- Excuse him. Please move back. - No.

759
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,800
- That wasn't me. - Move back.

760
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,425
That wasn't me.

761
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:51,030
What do you mean?

762
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,340
- What are you doing? - Don't laugh.

763
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:55,240
- Don't laugh! - What was that?

764
00:25:55,243 --> 00:25:56,965
What are you doing?

765
00:25:57,712 --> 00:25:59,680
Why are you staring at nothing?

766
00:25:59,681 --> 00:26:01,040
You should get checked, Seok Jin.

767
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,650
- Seok Jin. - This is bad.

768
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:05,420
- Seok Jin. - What?

769
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,980
- No. - Everybody heard it.

770
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:09,390
- We're competitive. - Of course.

771
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:11,605
- Okay! - Life is one shot.

772
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,820
- This is our style. - According to the results,

773
00:26:13,829 --> 00:26:17,085
Team Face bet 140 dollars.

774
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:19,430
- Team Voice bet... - We'll win.

775
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:21,870
- 110 dollars. - I knew it.

776
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,300
See?

777
00:26:23,305 --> 00:26:25,540
The winning team...

778
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,910
will take 500 dollars which is double 250 dollars.

779
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,910
(The winning team will take 500 dollars.)

780
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:31,470
(We must win.)

781
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:33,510
- We have to win. - If we win,

782
00:26:33,515 --> 00:26:35,150
- we'll win overall. - We have to win.

783
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,450
- We'll win. - We have to win.

784
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:38,010
This looks difficult. What do I do?

785
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:39,720
Soo Hyang, we have to win.

786
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,790
- Okay. - Pay attention, Soo Hyang!

787
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,020
- Be quiet. - Who are you?

788
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:45,260
- Be quiet! - Be quiet, Seok Jin.

789
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,460
(You need to pay attention, Seok Jin.)

790
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:47,720
(Okay.)

791
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,960
All right. Here's the first question.

792
00:26:49,965 --> 00:26:51,800
(It's the first question.)

793
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,970
"Love, a new love".

794
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,670
("Love, a new love".)

795
00:26:59,674 --> 00:27:00,700
(She got it.)

796
00:27:00,709 --> 00:27:03,140
- Do we go? - I think she knows.

797
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:05,125
- I think she knows. - We're faster.

798
00:27:06,281 --> 00:27:08,080
- 2, 3... - Just go.

799
00:27:08,083 --> 00:27:10,235
(Hopping)

800
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:12,020
- We're fast. - Catch up.

801
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,780
- We're fast. - We're faster.

802
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:15,890
We're much faster, Soo Hyang.

803
00:27:15,891 --> 00:27:17,150
- Go. - We're much faster.

804
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,860
- Do you know this? - Love...

805
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,020
- Do you know? - "New Face" by Psy.

806
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:24,530
(Team Face goes first. Soo Hyang's answer is "New Face" by Psy.)

807
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:28,870
(Are these lyrics from "New Face?)

808
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,070
("New Face" by Psy is correct.)

809
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:32,140
- Why are you so good? - You're right.

810
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,495
(Our captain is the best.)

811
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:39,035
(They get it now.)

812
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,540
(Here's the answer.)

813
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:43,435
I danced to this.

814
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:46,575
(They're dizzy because the answer makes their hearts flutter.)

815
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:49,775
(Let's win.)

816
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:52,560
Let's go back and get a good spot.

817
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,720
- Let's go. - Let's go.

818
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,175
(Let's get a good spot while they're having fun.)

819
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,230
I'm going crazy

820
00:27:56,231 --> 00:27:59,000
(They only got one question right, but their hearts are fluttering.)

821
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
(She reproduces the dance perfectly.)

822
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:02,655
(So Min does too.)

823
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:05,295
(They're in a trance.)

824
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,240
(This is Team Face.)

825
00:28:08,243 --> 00:28:09,410
Let's go!

826
00:28:09,411 --> 00:28:11,965
- We started late. - We have to move fast.

827
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,680
- I'll just go. - Let's think on the way.

828
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:15,350
I'll grab them too.

829
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,865
- I was being too nice. - Let's go!

830
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,280
(They don't know what's going on, and they're still dancing.)

831
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,590
Good job.

832
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,750
(They try their best.)

833
00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:26,715
(Team Face is the best.)

834
00:28:26,895 --> 00:28:28,220
(When are they going to stop?)

835
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:29,785
Okay.

836
00:28:30,031 --> 00:28:32,900
- That was good. - I danced to this in a drama.

837
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:34,700
- Really? - That's great.

838
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:36,270
She did this dance.

839
00:28:36,271 --> 00:28:38,070
(Team Voice gets a good position while the other team celebrates.)

840
00:28:38,073 --> 00:28:39,340
Hold on.

841
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:40,340
(When did they go back?)

842
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,810
- Weren't we supposed to dance? - You had to watch us.

843
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,570
They got mad and left.

844
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:46,180
- Goodness. - They left.

845
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:48,140
Come back if you're done.

846
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,880
- Come back. - Back to position.

847
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:51,650
That's not fair, Ha Na.

848
00:28:51,653 --> 00:28:52,850
They left because they lost.

849
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:55,320
They can't leave us while we're dancing.

850
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:57,650
- Congratulations. - We're in position.

851
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:00,360
Our team captain told us to leave.

852
00:29:00,362 --> 00:29:02,130
That's not fair, Ha Na.

853
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:05,130
- We were fast. - We were so fast.

854
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,715
- That was great, Soo Hyang. - That was excellent.

855
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:10,470
- Excuse me, Captain Lee. - Yes.

856
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:13,140
I saw you clapping and smiling.

857
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,610
You could have come down there,

858
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,510
- but when we were speaking... - Sorry.

859
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:18,980
I...

860
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,450
(She clapped without sincerity.)

861
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,850
I thought you were all smiley and kind,

862
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:26,750
but she doesn't act that way.

863
00:29:26,755 --> 00:29:28,590
Why would you get mad because you lost?

864
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,350
- That's not what you do. - Why?

865
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:34,115
She's doing her job as the team captain.

866
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,130
She looked so pretentious.

867
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,290
She wants you to start.

868
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:39,585
- She wants you to start. - Start.

869
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,055
Do you want us to show you?

870
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,930
- Let's go. That was good. - This is so funny.

871
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:47,340
- Here's the second question. - Let's go.

872
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:48,740
We have to win this time.

873
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,110
- Let's go, Soo Hyang. - All right.

874
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:52,280
Go as soon as you know.

875
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,640
Go right away.

876
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:58,005
(Their plan is to block Team Face.)

877
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:00,980
(Second question)

878
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:03,845
"Think twice".

879
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:08,320
"I can't act nice"...

880
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:09,330
Go.

881
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,330
(Go, go, go!)

882
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,500
(Go first.)

883
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,885
What is it?

884
00:30:14,469 --> 00:30:16,070
- Go. - 2, 3, 4.

885
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:17,070
(Shall we go too?)

886
00:30:17,072 --> 00:30:18,330
Go.

887
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:19,340
(Pushing)

888
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,695
Go.

889
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:24,010
(Falling)

890
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:25,080
Hey.

891
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
(Go first.)

892
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:27,635
Hey, Jong Kook.

893
00:30:27,849 --> 00:30:30,450
- What was it? - "I can't act nice"...

894
00:30:30,452 --> 00:30:31,920
What is this song?

895
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,520
(Team Voice is at the microphone.)

896
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:34,820
- Kim Hyun Jung? - What was it?

897
00:30:34,823 --> 00:30:37,245
- Kim Hyun Jung? - 5, 4,

898
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:40,315
3, 2...

899
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:43,330
(They're here, but they have no idea. What's her answer?)

900
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,430
Kim Hyun Jung?

901
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:45,955
(She's not sure.)

902
00:30:46,234 --> 00:30:47,600
"Think twice".

903
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:51,530
(Is it a song by Kim Hyun Jung?)

904
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:53,440
(It's incorrect.)

905
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,700
(There's a penalty for saying the incorrect answer.)

906
00:30:54,709 --> 00:30:56,165
There's cold air.

907
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:58,665
This is our chance.

908
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,480
(Let's go and guess.)

909
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:01,980
- Start. 1, 2... - I have to get up.

910
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:04,250
I have to get up!

911
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:06,220
(I have to walk too.)

912
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,780
I have to get up!

913
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:08,820
(Dragging)

914
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:10,650
Just go.

915
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:11,960
(Sorry, but we have no time.)

916
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,560
Hold on!

917
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:15,330
(Seok Jin falls as well.)

918
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:17,945
Hurry up.

919
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:19,900
(Soo Hyang doesn't know the answer either.)

920
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:21,300
The lyrics sound familiar.

921
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,870
(Soo Hyang doesn't know the answer either.)

922
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:25,030
"I can't pretend to be nice like other people".

923
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,040
(Team Voice has no idea.)

924
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:29,240
"I can't pretend to be nice like other people".

925
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:30,965
"I can't pretend to be nice"...

926
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:33,180
"Bad Girl, Bad Boy"...

927
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:36,405
- "Bad Girl, Good Girl". - Miss A.

928
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,720
"Bad Girl, Good Girl" by Miss A.

929
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,135
(Kwang Soo and Seok Jin think it's "Bad Girl, Good Girl" by Miss A.)

930
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:45,960
(I can't pretend to be nice like other people)
subtitles ripped and synced by riri13

931
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,460
(Wrong)

932
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:51,290
(It's wrong?)

933
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:52,400
It's our turn, right?

934
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,515
Here's the next line. Listen carefully.

935
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:57,125
"You probably don't know yet".

936
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:00,900
"If you want, test me".

937
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,895
(I think I know.)

938
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:05,880
- Test me? - Text me?

939
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,495
"You're too obvious".

940
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:09,950
(I think I know. Let's go!)

941
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:11,365
There are lyrics like that?

942
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:13,075
I think it's a pretty new song.

943
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:15,890
"Ddu-du Ddu-du" by BLACKPINK.

944
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,750
(Ha Na thinks it's "Ddu-du Ddu-du" by BLACPINK.)

945
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:22,360
(Is this finally the correct answer?)

946
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:25,330
(Correct)

947
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,000
- Gosh. - Really?

948
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,925
There are lyrics like that?

949
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,140
- The lyrics did sound familiar. - Ha Na is amazing.

950
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,940
(Correct answer)

951
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:36,040
Oh, it was that song.

952
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:37,810
- Ha Na. - I can't pretend to be nice

953
00:32:37,812 --> 00:32:40,840
(Ha Na managed to remember the song.)

954
00:32:40,848 --> 00:32:43,005
Shoot!

955
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,675
(Ha Na is really excited this time.)

956
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:51,150
(Let us dance too.)

957
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,560
(It doesn't matter whether we get the question right or not.)

958
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,460
You did a great job.

959
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,845
(We respect Ha Na.)

960
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,300
- It sounded so familiar. - Goodness, Ha Na.

961
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:02,270
- Ha Na. - It was a famous song.

962
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,070
Let's get two questions right, Soo Hyang.

963
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:05,370
Let's get two questions right.

964
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:08,355
- Otherwise, we'll go under. - We'll go bankrupt.

965
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,470
There's one question left.

966
00:33:10,478 --> 00:33:11,980
Move a little.

967
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,380
We're too close.

968
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:16,805
Ha Na won't move. I can't believe it.

969
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,210
She's so competitive.

970
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,720
(This question will determine who will win 500 dollars.)

971
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:22,790
All right. Ha Na.

972
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,945
(Team Voice is determined. Team Face has bet almost all their money.)

973
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:26,660
(What's the last question?)

974
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,130
"I've been waiting for today".

975
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:30,790
- Go! - Go!

976
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:33,300
(Both teams start to run as soon as they hear the question.)

977
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:35,015
- Go! - Go!

978
00:33:35,403 --> 00:33:37,830
I know it. Definitely.

979
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:39,140
Definitely.

980
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,300
(Let us say the answer.)

981
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:41,400
Seriously.

982
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:43,465
(They fall.)

983
00:33:44,012 --> 00:33:45,170
Why do we keep falling?

984
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,380
(They're forced to take a break again.)

985
00:33:46,381 --> 00:33:49,150
They pushed us.

986
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,410
We know the answer.

987
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:51,550
"Invitation" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

988
00:33:51,552 --> 00:33:53,150
- I've been waiting for today - "Invitation" by Uhm Jung Hwa.

989
00:33:53,154 --> 00:33:54,980
(Ha Na says the right answer.)

990
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:56,890
We got it right!

991
00:33:56,891 --> 00:33:58,150
Play the music!

992
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,145
- You're the best. - Dance time!

993
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:04,230
(We've been waiting for you)

994
00:34:04,232 --> 00:34:05,855
- Lee Ha Na! - Lee Ha Na!

995
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,200
(We've been waiting for a captain like her)

996
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:11,325
- Lee Ha Na! - Lee Ha Na!

997
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:15,965
(Team Voice has amazing teamwork.)

998
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:20,565
(The other team has great teamwork too.)

999
00:34:20,682 --> 00:34:24,250
(Team Voice wins 500 dollars, double of what they bet.)

1000
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,875
(Kissing)

1001
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,920
- Goodness. - Thank you.

1002
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:31,090
Let's take it off.

1003
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,160
Are you having a picnic?

1004
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:35,815
Ha Na, when we fell, you didn't even look at us.

1005
00:34:36,631 --> 00:34:38,190
You're so mean.

1006
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,600
You should get up.

1007
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
- What? - You should get up.

1008
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,730
- What did you say? - Stop pretending to be nice.

1009
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,440
You're just pretending to be nice.

1010
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:49,295
- "They're so cute." - She thinks you're cute.

1011
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,210
(Team Voice wins the 1st mission.)

1012
00:34:53,214 --> 00:34:55,980
The winner of the 1st mission is Team Voice.

1013
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:58,150
(They win 500 dollars.)

1014
00:34:58,152 --> 00:35:00,620
- Ha Na, you're the best. - You're amazing.

1015
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:03,475
I'm so disappointed. We did well in the beginning.

1016
00:35:03,491 --> 00:35:04,590
That's enough.

1017
00:35:04,592 --> 00:35:06,960
Yes!

1018
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,960
(Haha teases the other team.)

1019
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:10,515
Ha Na!

1020
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:14,000
We can do it.

1021
00:35:14,001 --> 00:35:16,200
The captain will distribute the prize money.

1022
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,030
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

1023
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,240
- Let's do this! - Lee Ha Na!

1024
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,695
(How will Ha Na distribute the prize money?)

1025
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:24,470
(It's time to distribute the prize money from the 1st mission.)

1026
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,210
Like I expected...

1027
00:35:26,214 --> 00:35:28,095
(How should I distribute it?)

1028
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:29,450
You trust me, right?

1029
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,550
- Yes! - Se Chan.

1030
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:31,710
I trust you.

1031
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,620
- Don't worry. - Okay.

1032
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,890
(The team members trust their captain.)

1033
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:38,960
(The captain has all the power.)

1034
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,130
(What's her decision?)

1035
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,430
It didn't take long.

1036
00:35:43,431 --> 00:35:45,090
I'm getting the hang of it.

1037
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,130
You are?

1038
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:47,360
(It's hard to know what Ha Na is thinking.)

1039
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:49,900
Who wants to see the balance?

1040
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:51,425
Me.

1041
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:53,340
Should we let the captain choose one person?

1042
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,055
Choose the one you trust the most.

1043
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,425
Se Chan.

1044
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,180
- Me? - Yes.

1045
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:02,095
- Really? - Yes.

1046
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,165
She must have given the money to Se Chan.

1047
00:36:04,218 --> 00:36:05,920
She must have given a lot to him.

1048
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,320
(Why is she letting Se Chan see his balance?)

1049
00:36:09,323 --> 00:36:13,760
(How much money does he have?)

1050
00:36:13,761 --> 00:36:15,375
How much do we have in total?

1051
00:36:15,463 --> 00:36:18,090
You won 500 dollars.

1052
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:21,915
(500 dollars?)

1053
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:26,770
(How much did Ha Na give to Se Chan?)

1054
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:31,325
(The first distribution is over.)

1055
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,280
Everyone.

1056
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:35,040
A moment ago...

1057
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:38,710
- What's that? - Someone put it back together.

1058
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,375
That's been ripped up and put back together.

1059
00:36:40,388 --> 00:36:42,990
Two ballots arrived at the same time.

1060
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,190
- Gosh. - Oh, my.

1061
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:45,860
- Really? - That one is crumpled.

1062
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,160
What is this?

1063
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:48,830
Who did it? You?

1064
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,315
No.

1065
00:36:50,331 --> 00:36:51,590
The candidates are...

1066
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,700
(Who are the candidates among the 4 members?)

1067
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,255
Lee Kwang Soo and Jeon So Min.

1068
00:36:57,138 --> 00:36:58,330
- Gosh. - You guys...

1069
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,040
(You guys are unbelievable.)

1070
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:02,100
I knew it.

1071
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:04,270
(Kwang Soo and So Min rebel at the same time.)

1072
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:05,370
You wrote your name?

1073
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:06,610
- The thing is, - You guys...

1074
00:37:06,614 --> 00:37:09,905
I had to do something for my team.

1075
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:12,320
- I'm sweaty. - How could we not know?

1076
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,275
Exactly. "Ddu-du Ddu-du"...

1077
00:37:15,723 --> 00:37:19,645
(Kwang Soo hid behind Running Bank.)

1078
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:22,230
(He put the pieces back together.)

1079
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,685
This team is doomed.

1080
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:25,600
We'll be penalized at this rate.

1081
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,155
(I have to rebel.)

1082
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:30,970
(So Min had the same idea.)

1083
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:33,940
(They register as candidates.)

1084
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:35,300
(Jeon So Min)

1085
00:37:35,309 --> 00:37:37,370
There are three candidates.

1086
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:39,410
Im Soo Hyang, the current captain,

1087
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:42,805
Lee Kwang Soo, and Jeon So Min.

1088
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,750
The rest of the team will vote.

1089
00:37:44,752 --> 00:37:47,780
If you want to keep the current captain, write Soo Hyang's name.

1090
00:37:47,788 --> 00:37:52,590
If you want a new captain, vote for 1 of the other 2.

1091
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:54,020
- Okay. - We need to change something.

1092
00:37:54,028 --> 00:37:55,260
(The campaign starts.)

1093
00:37:55,263 --> 00:37:57,430
- Tell us about your plans. - Let's start a new age.

1094
00:37:57,431 --> 00:37:59,045
Let's listen to them.

1095
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,315
Do you think they can really change anything?

1096
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:06,470
(What?)

1097
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:09,465
Kwang Soo looks flustered.

1098
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:11,370
Please tell us your specific plans.

1099
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,710
How are you going to distribute the money?

1100
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,595
- If I become the captain... - This is important.

1101
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,210
I won't distribute the money...

1102
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,620
equally.

1103
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,990
I'll give everything to you two.

1104
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:26,360
(I'll give all the money to you two.)

1105
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,720
- Really? - Yes.

1106
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:29,530
- What's the ratio? - What's the ratio?

1107
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,290
I'll take everything from these guys...

1108
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:32,930
- Everything? - and give it to you.

1109
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,960
- You'll get double. - Double. Good.

1110
00:38:34,969 --> 00:38:36,600
Let's give her a big hand.

1111
00:38:36,604 --> 00:38:37,770
- Are you serious? - Next.

1112
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:40,170
- I'll be straightforward. - Do it.

1113
00:38:40,174 --> 00:38:41,855
If we win money,

1114
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,470
I'll divide it 2 to 4 to 4.

1115
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,180
(Jae Seok boos Kwang Soo.)

1116
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:49,450
I'm not finished.

1117
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,610
Why are you booing me?

1118
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,750
Okay.

1119
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,220
I don't have to win.

1120
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,620
I just don't want to finish at the bottom.

1121
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:57,090
5 to 5...

1122
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:58,350
(He boos again.)

1123
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,030
(Everything Kwang Soo says gets booed.)

1124
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,030
Okay.

1125
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,955
(He plays his final card.)

1126
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,800
- Is there more? - You'll get 100 percent.

1127
00:39:07,802 --> 00:39:09,570
(I'll give Jae Seok 100 percent.)

1128
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,770
(What?)

1129
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:13,040
What about me?

1130
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,200
- You... - What?

1131
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,010
(Kwang Soo will give 100 percent to Jae Seok.)

1132
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,710
I'll divide it 4 to 4 to 2.

1133
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:19,210
- Okay. - 4 to 4 to 2.

1134
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:20,480
- 4, 4, 2. - Next.

1135
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:23,080
- Soo Hyang. - I'll give everything to you too.

1136
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:24,250
But...

1137
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:26,720
look at these betrayers.

1138
00:39:26,721 --> 00:39:29,090
Can you really trust them?

1139
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,445
Your hand.

1140
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,405
Raise it.

1141
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,820
If you trust these betrayers,

1142
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:37,745
they'll stab you in the back again.

1143
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:39,200
Okay. Let's vote.

1144
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,225
(The 3 of them vote.)

1145
00:39:44,772 --> 00:39:46,440
Soo Hyang. You're not done yet, right?

1146
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,895
Let me tell you one thing.

1147
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:49,840
- I... - I'm done.

1148
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,710
(Cold)

1149
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:55,240
(You're done?)

1150
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:56,880
(That's too bad.)

1151
00:39:56,884 --> 00:39:58,210
I'm sorry.

1152
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:00,075
You should have said it earlier.

1153
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,780
(The voting is already over.)

1154
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:03,750
- Good job. - Soo Hyang is so attractive.

1155
00:40:03,758 --> 00:40:06,315
- She did a good job. - She's so cold.

1156
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:08,115
The result is out.

1157
00:40:08,763 --> 00:40:11,190
The captain of Team Face is...

1158
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:13,900
(The rebellion vote result)

1159
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:16,570
(Who will be the captain?)

1160
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,270
Jeon So Min.

1161
00:40:18,272 --> 00:40:19,470
(So Min becomes the new captain.)

1162
00:40:19,473 --> 00:40:20,540
(The age of Captain Jeon begins.)

1163
00:40:20,541 --> 00:40:22,055
Guys!

1164
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:23,710
- How? - Really?

1165
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:25,225
So suddenly?

1166
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,835
We voted for you.

1167
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:29,650
Thank you.

1168
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:31,965
- That's right. - Thank you so much.

1169
00:40:32,053 --> 00:40:33,320
Oh, my gosh.

1170
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,980
(I'm doomed.)

1171
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:36,190
Then...

1172
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,850
So Min and...

1173
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:40,960
Soo Hyang will switch their accounts.

1174
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,730
Jae Seok and Seok Jin, who voted for So Min,

1175
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,730
can go to the bank...

1176
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:49,400
and see their balances.

1177
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:52,640
Let's take a look.

1178
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,255
(How did Soo Hyang distribute the money?)

1179
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:56,810
Is this mine?

1180
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:58,965
Please give me mine. Thanks.

1181
00:41:00,214 --> 00:41:01,280
What is this?

1182
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:02,580
(Jae Seok has no money.)

1183
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,865
(Meanwhile...)

1184
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,280
(Seok Jin has minus 150 dollars.)

1185
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:09,945
(I'm sorry.)

1186
00:41:11,092 --> 00:41:12,350
Hold on.

1187
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:13,745
(He can't believe it.)

1188
00:41:14,228 --> 00:41:15,775
Does this mean...

1189
00:41:16,163 --> 00:41:17,885
I'm in debt?

1190
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:19,100
I'm in debt.

1191
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
(His bank account has a negative balance.)

1192
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:21,260
- Am I in debt? - Yes.

1193
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:25,430
(He has a negative balance for forcing his team to go in debt.)

1194
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,400
- This world is awful. - Excuse me.

1195
00:41:27,408 --> 00:41:28,800
- Seok Jin. - Yes?

1196
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,970
I have no balance.

1197
00:41:30,978 --> 00:41:32,210
Did you take it all?

1198
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,380
(Did you take all the debt?)

1199
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,750
I didn't. This world is awful though.

1200
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,350
How much do you have, Seok Jin?

1201
00:41:37,351 --> 00:41:38,610
I have money.

1202
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,605
I think he got a lot of the loan.

1203
00:41:41,088 --> 00:41:42,590
Here's the next round.

1204
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,305
- Let's go. - Okay.

1205
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:48,315
(They move to the next location.)

1206
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:52,745
Why are you there by yourself?

1207
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,670
They're discussing.

1208
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,125
There's going to be a revolt.

1209
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,940
Ha Na, don't trust them.

1210
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:02,455
(They're talking without me.)

1211
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:04,710
- Se Chan... - Let's hear what he has to say.

1212
00:42:04,712 --> 00:42:06,380
(Se Chan saw the balance earlier, so let's listen to him.)

1213
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,740
What happened?

1214
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:08,780
Should I say it?

1215
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:10,610
I wanted to say it openly.

1216
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:12,110
- Can you do that? - Yes.

1217
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,720
I don't care.

1218
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:16,675
How do you know if we'll support you or not?

1219
00:42:17,191 --> 00:42:20,045
That doesn't matter because I'm not in the last place.

1220
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:22,220
- You're not? - No.

1221
00:42:22,229 --> 00:42:24,185
So it's not me.

1222
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:25,690
It's not me.

1223
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:28,600
You don't know what other people have.

1224
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:30,870
- Those who have a lot... - But from my balance,

1225
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:32,970
somebody doesn't have any money.

1226
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:34,600
I'm not in the last place though.

1227
00:42:34,608 --> 00:42:38,770
You three should rise in revolt.

1228
00:42:38,779 --> 00:42:40,735
You have to do something.

1229
00:42:40,748 --> 00:42:41,780
(She's so nervous.)

1230
00:42:41,782 --> 00:42:43,835
They're going to change the captain.

1231
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:45,110
They're mean.

1232
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,435
(They're changing their minds. What will happen to Team Voice?)

1233
00:42:47,822 --> 00:42:49,820
- What's this? Is this water? - What's this?

1234
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:52,345
This is a giant water bomb.

1235
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,760
Before we start the second mission,

1236
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:56,760
we'll proceed with the second loan.

1237
00:42:56,764 --> 00:42:59,800
- Okay. - This is a voice loan.

1238
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,655
It's called Burning Forehead.

1239
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,525
Forehead?

1240
00:43:04,572 --> 00:43:06,140
Do you have to get slapped on the forehead?

1241
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,640
You slap your teammate on the forehead,

1242
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:10,010
and you can borrow 10 dollars...

1243
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,870
for every decibel.

1244
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:12,910
(You can get 50 dollars.)

1245
00:43:12,913 --> 00:43:14,295
10 dollars?

1246
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:15,950
Jae Seok's slaps...

1247
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,250
are really loud.

1248
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:19,220
I'm confident I can do this.

1249
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,920
Let's go for 200.

1250
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:22,890
Kwang Soo and I...

1251
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:25,205
(They're partners.)

1252
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:26,560
(Am I confirmed?)

1253
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,920
- Give them a chance. - The important thing is...

1254
00:43:27,928 --> 00:43:29,630
- We work great together. - Right.

1255
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,230
- I'll keep that in mind. - Remember what you did in Busan.

1256
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:33,600
We'll do what we did in Busan.

1257
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:35,870
(I'll go around the country with Jae Seok this way.)

1258
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,730
I heard something earlier.

1259
00:43:37,738 --> 00:43:40,040
Ha Na boxes these days.

1260
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,140
Does she?

1261
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:44,170
- Jang Hyuk recommended it. - Yes.

1262
00:43:44,178 --> 00:43:45,310
She boxes.

1263
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:46,380
She's been doing it for six months.

1264
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,835
(She's been boxing for 6 months thanks to Jang Hyuk.)

1265
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:49,780
- Show us. - Shadowbox for us.

1266
00:43:49,783 --> 00:43:51,305
(Show me the punch.)

1267
00:43:51,452 --> 00:43:52,510
(That's a perfect punch.)

1268
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:53,975
She's good.

1269
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,180
She looks cool.

1270
00:43:55,189 --> 00:43:56,990
Go again. 1, 2, 3.

1271
00:43:56,991 --> 00:43:58,250
1, 2, and 3.

1272
00:43:58,259 --> 00:43:59,860
Great.

1273
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,760
("Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.")

1274
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:05,090
We're in trouble. I bet she's strong.

1275
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,100
(They have to get slapped later. They're in trouble.)

1276
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,255
What if she punches us?

1277
00:44:08,669 --> 00:44:10,630
(Team Face goes first.)

1278
00:44:10,638 --> 00:44:12,370
I'm sacrificing myself.

1279
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,355
This is teamwork between Kwang Soo and me.

1280
00:44:15,409 --> 00:44:16,510
Sacrifice this once.

1281
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,925
(It's time to appreciate their teamwork.)

1282
00:44:20,581 --> 00:44:22,035
Hold on.

1283
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,850
(He thinks about it.)

1284
00:44:24,852 --> 00:44:27,020
Why am I crouched down here?

1285
00:44:27,021 --> 00:44:28,480
- It's for the team. - What?

1286
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,890
Your forehead is the widest.

1287
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,905
When will he stop slapping my forehead?

1288
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:35,720
- I followed him to Busan last week. - We only have 10 dollars.

1289
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:39,030
You're awesome.

1290
00:44:39,033 --> 00:44:40,600
Soo Hyang thinks you're awesome.

1291
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:44,130
- Lee Kwang Soo. - He's happy.

1292
00:44:44,138 --> 00:44:46,370
- She thinks you're awesome. - You're doing it for the team.

1293
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:48,640
You're much more handsome with your hair back.

1294
00:44:48,642 --> 00:44:52,370
(That did it.)

1295
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:53,880
(Soo Hyang knows it.)

1296
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:55,040
He's happy.

1297
00:44:55,049 --> 00:44:57,110
(I'll put my hair back...)

1298
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:59,550
(and be handsome then.)

1299
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:01,835
Hey, Eun Woo was her partner in the drama.

1300
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:03,890
- Eun Woo was her partner. - That's right.

1301
00:45:03,891 --> 00:45:06,245
You look much better. You should do that.

1302
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,115
- Okay. - Okay!

1303
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:14,055
(Soo Hyang, I'll show you what my forehead sounds like.)

1304
00:45:15,169 --> 00:45:16,825
(Slapping)

1305
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:20,425
(It always sounds sweet and clear.)

1306
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,295
(Oh, dear. Where did that sound come from?)

1307
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:26,580
(This is worth 840 dollars.)

1308
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,080
That was so loud.

1309
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:29,080
(We have to win.)

1310
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,810
- How do we beat them? - 82?

1311
00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:34,320
If you use this part of the hand, it's not too loud.

1312
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:37,490
You have to hit hard. Use your whole hand.

1313
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:39,250
Your whole hand has to make contact.

1314
00:45:39,259 --> 00:45:40,915
Okay.

1315
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:43,330
Let's go. Let's do this.

1316
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,745
(The lesson is over. Let's go.)

1317
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,185
(Jong Kook cares about Ha Na. What is his winning strategy?)

1318
00:45:51,672 --> 00:45:54,395
(His forehead is reliable.)

1319
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,625
(It's too reliable.)

1320
00:45:59,079 --> 00:46:03,250
(Jong Kook is a passionate team member under a passionate leader.)

1321
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,965
(They're focused.)

1322
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,580
You're too close.

1323
00:46:07,588 --> 00:46:09,080
- You're too close. - I see.

1324
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:10,650
- You can't hold that. - What?

1325
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:13,160
(That's cheating.)

1326
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,660
You can't do that.

1327
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,530
- He might move back. - He's scared.

1328
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:18,130
(He tries to get the instrument close to him.)

1329
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:19,230
Slap hard.

1330
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:20,655
It's okay.

1331
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,415
(Hesitating)

1332
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:26,840
- It's okay. - Swing a few times.

1333
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,640
Swing a few times.

1334
00:46:28,642 --> 00:46:32,025
It's okay.

1335
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:35,640
(How will she swing?)

1336
00:46:35,649 --> 00:46:37,750
You're the best in the world, Jong Kook.

1337
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:39,310
(Slapping)

1338
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:40,420
(Did she hit his eyes?)

1339
00:46:40,421 --> 00:46:42,035
(No, my eyes.)

1340
00:46:42,823 --> 00:46:46,660
(She aims at the wrong place,)

1341
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,985
(and his small eyes widen.)

1342
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:51,990
(How does such sound come from the eyes?)

1343
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:53,355
She hit his eyes.

1344
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,370
- Are you all right? - Did you get hit in the eyes?

1345
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,430
(His legs give out from Ha Na's smash.)

1346
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:58,470
I'm sorry.

1347
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:00,540
- Are you all right? - Hold on.

1348
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:01,940
- Did you yell? - She hit my eyes.

1349
00:47:01,942 --> 00:47:03,210
(Ha Na's legs give out because she feels bad.)

1350
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,465
- Do you see this? - Hold on.

1351
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:07,980
Do you see this?

1352
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:09,695
That was a good slap though.

1353
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:11,610
Goodness.

1354
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,980
- The sound was... - Jong Kook, your eyes...

1355
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:15,480
I'm so sorry.

1356
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:16,720
He saw a light.

1357
00:47:16,723 --> 00:47:18,950
I've never heard him make a noise when he gets hit.

1358
00:47:18,959 --> 00:47:20,360
Me too.

1359
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,375
(They've never seen him like this.)

1360
00:47:22,463 --> 00:47:23,830
He was cute.

1361
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:26,185
We know...

1362
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:28,460
something from this.

1363
00:47:28,469 --> 00:47:30,370
Jong Kook feels pain too.

1364
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,140
- I know. He's so humanly. - He's a human, not a robot.

1365
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,640
"Sponge" is back after a long time.

1366
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:37,810
- Jong Kook feels pain too. - He feels pain.

1367
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:42,195
(Jong Kook feels pain too.)

1368
00:47:42,382 --> 00:47:43,910
This is so humanly.

1369
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:47,180
(Thanks to Jong Kook and Ha Na, they earn 830 dollars.)

1370
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:48,480
- It's a 10-dollar difference. - Please decide...

1371
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:51,650
under whose names you'll borrow the loans.

1372
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:52,860
- 830 dollars? - Yes.

1373
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:55,620
(Captain Ha Na goes first.)

1374
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:59,090
Earlier, how much did I borrow?

1375
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,360
(She considers how much she borrowed the 1st time.)

1376
00:48:02,369 --> 00:48:03,830
I'll do that.

1377
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:05,285
(She decides on the 2nd amount.)

1378
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,355
I want to divide it up.

1379
00:48:10,043 --> 00:48:11,810
So Min, remember who voted for you.

1380
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:14,735
Remember who made you the leader.

1381
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,310
(Captain So Min borrows the 2nd loan too.)

1382
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:19,805
This is very fair.

1383
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:21,535
I got some of it too.

1384
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:22,890
- I got some too. - Are you sure?

1385
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:23,990
Yes, I am.

1386
00:48:23,991 --> 00:48:26,405
(How did she distribute the loan?)

1387
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:29,830
All right. The second mission is Flour Puck.

1388
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,330
(Mission 2: Flour Puck)

1389
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,900
There's flour in the middle of the table.

1390
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:36,870
Each team gets 100 paper pucks.

1391
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,530
You play 1 on 1 and take turns blowing at the stack.

1392
00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:41,840
The person who blows away all 100 paper pucks 1st wins.

1393
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,210
These are pucks. I'm good at this.

1394
00:48:44,211 --> 00:48:45,270
Pucks?

1395
00:48:45,279 --> 00:48:46,280
(Those who've played it before are confident.)

1396
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,380
I'm good at this too.

1397
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:51,250
The remaining team members will receive the penalty...

1398
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:52,950
as soon as the loser is decided.

1399
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:54,120
(They get the penalty as soon as the losing team is decided.)

1400
00:48:54,121 --> 00:48:56,820
According to the mission betting results,

1401
00:48:56,823 --> 00:49:01,360
the winning team will take 2,680 dollars.

1402
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:04,530
(The winning team will take 2,680 dollars.)

1403
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,655
- Hey, we got 1 shot. - This is 1 shot.

1404
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,255
This is one shot.

1405
00:49:08,802 --> 00:49:10,170
Who goes first?

1406
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:11,525
(Kwang Soo versus Se Chan)

1407
00:49:11,538 --> 00:49:14,695
Jae Seok, do I have to put my chin here? Should I go first?

1408
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:16,140
- What? - Should I go first?

1409
00:49:16,143 --> 00:49:18,210
- You can't switch. - I have to put my face here.

1410
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:20,235
It's okay.

1411
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:21,880
What's okay?

1412
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:23,605
- Why are you okay? - It's okay.

1413
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:25,950
- It won't hurt. - I know it won't.

1414
00:49:25,953 --> 00:49:27,420
Don't worry. It's okay.

1415
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:29,590
Soo Hyang likes men with fair skin.

1416
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,905
(She drives him into doing it.)

1417
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:33,560
(Does she?)

1418
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,375
(Smiling)

1419
00:49:35,429 --> 00:49:36,630
He's happy.

1420
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:38,390
(Can you take it for the team?)

1421
00:49:38,398 --> 00:49:40,455
(I'll do it.)

1422
00:49:40,567 --> 00:49:42,560
Your name is Namyangju Handsome Face.

1423
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:44,970
- You're handsome, Kwang Soo. - Okay.

1424
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:46,625
(Namyangju Handsome Face and Gangnam Beauty)

1425
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:50,195
(I can take the flour if she likes fair skin.)

1426
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:52,980
- Let's win, Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo!

1427
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,080
- Kwang Soo! - We have to win!

1428
00:49:55,082 --> 00:49:57,565
(These two...)

1429
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:02,120
(Kwang Soo can topple the whole stack.)

1430
00:50:02,122 --> 00:50:05,745
(Se Chan's technique is to blow softly.)

1431
00:50:05,993 --> 00:50:09,675
(The rivalry starts now.)

1432
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,885
(How will Se Chan's first attack be?)

1433
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,015
- Okay. - Nice.

1434
00:50:15,168 --> 00:50:18,425
(That was expected.)

1435
00:50:19,539 --> 00:50:20,540
Nice.

1436
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,665
(He flips over many in one blow.)

1437
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:25,370
(That was amazing.)

1438
00:50:25,379 --> 00:50:26,480
That's amazing.

1439
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,140
These ones are flipped.

1440
00:50:28,148 --> 00:50:30,710
1, 2, 3, 4...

1441
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:33,420
- 17, 18, 19, 20, - 17, 18, 19, 20...

1442
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:36,235
- 21, 22. - All right.

1443
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,550
- Can you win? - I can do 22.

1444
00:50:38,558 --> 00:50:40,460
I can flip 100. Okay, trust me.

1445
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:41,815
This is not bad.

1446
00:50:41,828 --> 00:50:43,175
Good luck.

1447
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,130
- Good luck, Kwang Soo. - Good luck.

1448
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:47,300
- Good luck. - Let's go!

1449
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,600
- Lee Kwang Soo. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1450
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:49,870
- Trust me. - Lee Kwang Soo.

1451
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:50,930
Lee Kwang Soo.

1452
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:53,185
(You can trust Namyangju Handsome Face.)

1453
00:50:54,341 --> 00:50:57,110
(He's done it before.)

1454
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:01,280
(He hopes he can flip all 100.)

1455
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:06,065
(His lips remember how it's done.)

1456
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,275
There's not that many. Okay, don't move!

1457
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:15,115
(That's it?)

1458
00:51:15,128 --> 00:51:16,360
(If this cost money, people would have asked for their money back.)

1459
00:51:16,363 --> 00:51:18,945
- Referee? - Not many flipped.

1460
00:51:18,999 --> 00:51:20,300
What is this?

1461
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,000
- Gosh. - What is Kwang Soo doing?

1462
00:51:22,002 --> 00:51:23,555
Kwang Soo.

1463
00:51:23,637 --> 00:51:27,440
- What is this? - 1, 2, 3,

1464
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:28,800
- 4, 5, 6. - Kwang Soo!

1465
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:31,210
If the surface was hard,

1466
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:32,610
everything would have flipped.

1467
00:51:32,612 --> 00:51:34,980
But here, only the flour gets blown away. Now, I get it.

1468
00:51:34,981 --> 00:51:37,705
- You should blow in the middle. - Okay. I get it.

1469
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:38,810
You need a technique.

1470
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,820
- Shouldn't the captains compete? - Sounds good.

1471
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:43,420
- Let's do it. - Ha Na versus Soo Hyang.

1472
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:45,250
Okay! You can do it.

1473
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:47,760
- Roll your lips in. - Like Choi Bool Am.

1474
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:48,920
(Soo Hyang is receiving a lesson.)

1475
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:51,385
- Like this. - Roll your lips in more.

1476
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:54,015
Not like that.

1477
00:51:55,268 --> 00:51:57,330
- Completely... - Your lips are bleeding.

1478
00:51:57,337 --> 00:51:58,430
Bleeding?

1479
00:51:58,438 --> 00:51:59,670
You're bleeding.

1480
00:51:59,673 --> 00:52:01,440
- You're bleeding. - Really?

1481
00:52:01,441 --> 00:52:04,565
Kwang Soo's lips are bleeding. Look at this.

1482
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:06,710
(His lips are bleeding.)

1483
00:52:06,713 --> 00:52:09,240
He must have blown really hard.

1484
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:10,910
- Really? - It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

1485
00:52:10,917 --> 00:52:12,410
- It doesn't hurt. - It doesn't hurt.

1486
00:52:12,419 --> 00:52:13,620
You didn't even know.

1487
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,280
I didn't.

1488
00:52:15,288 --> 00:52:17,390
- You have to do it like this. - It's so funny.

1489
00:52:17,391 --> 00:52:18,490
Roll your lips in.

1490
00:52:18,492 --> 00:52:21,260
(Soo Hyang is receiving lessons from the members.)

1491
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,915
Like Choi Bool Am.

1492
00:52:23,797 --> 00:52:24,790
(Ha Na is practicing on her own.)

1493
00:52:24,798 --> 00:52:25,990
Soo Hyang, you need to sit down.

1494
00:52:25,999 --> 00:52:27,460
(Ha Na is practicing on her own.)

1495
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:28,860
- She's good. - You're doing well.

1496
00:52:28,869 --> 00:52:30,225
It looks good.

1497
00:52:30,537 --> 00:52:32,030
She must have spat a lot.

1498
00:52:32,038 --> 00:52:34,240
(Was she a bully in the past?)

1499
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,710
Blow as hard as you can.

1500
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,165
(Let me flip all the pucks.)

1501
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,180
But I feel too bad...

1502
00:52:43,183 --> 00:52:44,805
to blow the flour all over her face.

1503
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:47,475
But that's the point.

1504
00:52:48,522 --> 00:52:52,145
(Ha Na is worried about Soo Hyang. How will she do?)

1505
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,015
Did she...

1506
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:59,145
Did she spit at Soo Hyang's face?

1507
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:01,800
- Hold on. - It's like the Red Sea.

1508
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:03,500
Let me see.

1509
00:53:03,503 --> 00:53:05,770
- Hold on. - She hit Soo Hyang's face.

1510
00:53:05,772 --> 00:53:07,940
She aimed at Soo Hyang's face.

1511
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:10,110
- Good job. - She spat at Soo Hyang's face.

1512
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,810
- Good job. - I don't have a technique.

1513
00:53:11,812 --> 00:53:13,180
It's okay. You have nothing on your face.

1514
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,540
Three flipped.

1515
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:15,840
Five flipped.

1516
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,550
There you go.

1517
00:53:17,551 --> 00:53:19,410
It feels like she spat at me.

1518
00:53:19,419 --> 00:53:21,320
- Sorry. - Okay.

1519
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:22,480
(Ha Na, you humiliated me.)

1520
00:53:22,489 --> 00:53:24,845
I think we'll win.

1521
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:26,350
(Are you ready?)

1522
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:28,420
- Soo Hyang, let's do this. - Show us.

1523
00:53:28,428 --> 00:53:30,685
- Come closer. - Come closer.

1524
00:53:30,697 --> 00:53:32,690
(Ha Na,)

1525
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:36,160
(I'll pay you back.)

1526
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:39,185
(Will Soo Hyang get her revenge?)

1527
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,140
(Just two?)

1528
00:53:43,143 --> 00:53:44,610
- 1. - No, 2.

1529
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:46,070
It's two.

1530
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,180
- Two flipped. - Okay.

1531
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,250
- Two. - It's hard.

1532
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,750
- I guess I'm not lucky today. - It's not easy.

1533
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,120
- Ha Na is amazing. - We win.

1534
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,420
(Team Face: 92, Team Voice: 73)

1535
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:57,345
Let me try.

1536
00:53:57,591 --> 00:53:58,850
I can blow very hard.

1537
00:53:58,859 --> 00:53:59,860
(Confident)

1538
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,120
- Should I go? - Okay.

1539
00:54:02,128 --> 00:54:04,430
- Se Chan. - Should I go first?

1540
00:54:04,431 --> 00:54:06,130
Okay. Se Chan should go first.

1541
00:54:06,132 --> 00:54:07,300
(The real battle starts.)

1542
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,160
- It wasn't hard enough. - You need to take a long breath.

1543
00:54:09,169 --> 00:54:10,870
You need a long breath.

1544
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,595
(Will Se Chan win many points?)

1545
00:54:15,709 --> 00:54:18,010
- Okay. - Seok Jin got in the way.

1546
00:54:18,011 --> 00:54:19,610
- Okay. - Four.

1547
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,180
- Four. - This is our chance.

1548
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:22,795
- Okay. - He got in the way.

1549
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:24,505
- That's good. - Good.

1550
00:54:24,718 --> 00:54:26,820
- Goodness. - Seok Jin's face got in the way.

1551
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,435
He blew everything away. Se Chan, you can do it too.

1552
00:54:29,523 --> 00:54:30,890
Don't be too greedy.

1553
00:54:30,891 --> 00:54:31,890
Right.

1554
00:54:31,892 --> 00:54:33,490
(Seok Jin gets ready.)

1555
00:54:33,493 --> 00:54:36,375
Blow in the middle.

1556
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,445
Come closer.

1557
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,260
(Seok Jin is full of confidence.)

1558
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:45,625
(Will he save his team from a crisis?)

1559
00:54:45,739 --> 00:54:47,495
Great! Okay!

1560
00:54:47,741 --> 00:54:50,565
(Shocking)

1561
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,270
(Unbelievable)

1562
00:54:52,279 --> 00:54:54,635
- Nice. - Good.

1563
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:57,450
It was beautiful.

1564
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,650
- It was amazing. - We did it!

1565
00:54:58,652 --> 00:55:00,150
I told you I'm good at this.

1566
00:55:00,153 --> 00:55:03,180
- 2, 3, 4... 33... - 33...

1567
00:55:03,189 --> 00:55:05,050
(It makes them hum.)

1568
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:07,260
(It takes so long to even count the pucks.)

1569
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,630
- 40, 41, 42. - 40, 41, 42.

1570
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,890
(Seok Jin turns the tables around by flipping 42.)

1571
00:55:12,899 --> 00:55:14,900
- We did it! - Okay!

1572
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:17,070
When it comes to classic games, no one can beat Seok Jin.

1573
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,895
I used to play this a lot back in school.

1574
00:55:21,141 --> 00:55:23,310
- Let me try. - Aren't you going to shout my name?

1575
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,470
Let me try.

1576
00:55:24,477 --> 00:55:26,070
- It's not over yet. - Let me try.

1577
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,435
(Jong Kook steps up.)

1578
00:55:28,081 --> 00:55:31,050
(So you're good at this?)

1579
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:32,310
Let me do it.

1580
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,280
(I welcome any challengers.)

1581
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:36,280
I'll start.

1582
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:39,290
(Jong Kook looks determined.)

1583
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,675
Okay.

1584
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:45,030
(Shaking)

1585
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:48,755
(He's even shaking. What's the result?)

1586
00:55:48,768 --> 00:55:50,115
- It worked. - Okay.

1587
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:55,195
(A lot of pucks flipped.)

1588
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:56,710
Hold on.

1589
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,010
What about those standing?

1590
00:55:58,011 --> 00:55:59,710
- They don't count. - No?

1591
00:55:59,713 --> 00:56:01,780
- They don't. - What should we do?

1592
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:03,080
- They shouldn't count. - They're standing.

1593
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,705
They don't count.

1594
00:56:04,718 --> 00:56:06,410
They definitely don't count.

1595
00:56:06,419 --> 00:56:07,720
- They didn't flip. - Okay.

1596
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:09,880
- 25. - 25.

1597
00:56:09,889 --> 00:56:11,690
We're catching up.

1598
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:14,015
- Good. - Good.

1599
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:17,030
(The match between the strongest contestants)

1600
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,790
(When Seok Jin attacks,)

1601
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:21,415
(Jong Kook counterattacks.)

1602
00:56:22,002 --> 00:56:25,170
(The pucks keep flipping.)

1603
00:56:25,171 --> 00:56:27,240
Nothing flipped.

1604
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,795
- Okay. - Okay.

1605
00:56:28,808 --> 00:56:31,210
- Nothing flipped. - Let's switch players.

1606
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:33,025
- Should I try? - Let's put an end to this.

1607
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,535
- You? Okay. - Yes.

1608
00:56:35,982 --> 00:56:38,350
It's not easy.

1609
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:40,520
(He needs to flip 8 pucks to turn the game around.)

1610
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,480
- Nice. - He's good.

1611
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:44,150
- You don't have to blow so hard. - Yes, Coach.

1612
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:45,190
Go!

1613
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:47,245
(The players from the first round compete again.)

1614
00:56:49,262 --> 00:56:50,530
Flip everything.

1615
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:52,645
(Se Chan attacks first.)

1616
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,200
Gosh. His face.

1617
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:57,270
(Kwang Soo blocked the pucks with his face.)

1618
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,630
(Se Chan flips only 3 pucks.)

1619
00:56:58,638 --> 00:57:00,995
He flipped three.

1620
00:57:01,141 --> 00:57:02,900
It was perfect otherwise.

1621
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:04,110
- Only 3. - Kwang Soo!

1622
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:06,170
- Let me do this. - We have to put an end to this.

1623
00:57:06,179 --> 00:57:07,280
You did well. Let's do this!

1624
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,640
- It was perfect. - Flip seven.

1625
00:57:08,648 --> 00:57:10,705
(Show us what you've got.)

1626
00:57:12,118 --> 00:57:14,935
(Let me put an end to this.)

1627
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:22,875
It's okay.

1628
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:24,690
There's only one left.

1629
00:57:24,698 --> 00:57:27,000
- No. - There are some below.

1630
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,400
- There's only 1 left. - There's only 1 left.

1631
00:57:28,401 --> 00:57:29,800
- Okay! - Just one left.

1632
00:57:29,803 --> 00:57:32,830
- There's only one left. - This is the last round.

1633
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:34,700
- Gosh. We're broke. - Kwang Soo.

1634
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,500
There's only one left, Kwang Soo.

1635
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:37,910
- Okay. I'll do it. - There's only one left.

1636
00:57:37,911 --> 00:57:39,470
- I'll do it. - You have to do it.

1637
00:57:39,479 --> 00:57:41,780
- You have to flip it. - You have to flip it.

1638
00:57:41,781 --> 00:57:43,550
We've got your back. Don't worry about anything!

1639
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:46,005
Bite it if you have to.

1640
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,435
(Jong Kook shakes again.)

1641
00:57:50,356 --> 00:57:51,590
(Blowing)

1642
00:57:51,591 --> 00:57:53,445
- What? - Did it work?

1643
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:57,030
(How many did Jong Kook flip?)

1644
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,890
- Did I flip everything? - There are three left.

1645
00:57:58,898 --> 00:58:00,555
There are three left.

1646
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:03,655
There are three left.

1647
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:07,340
I'd be happy even if we lose.

1648
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,210
I'm that amazed. You're incredible.

1649
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,810
There are three left.

1650
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:13,525
Oh, my.

1651
00:58:16,249 --> 00:58:18,665
(It's hard to predict the result.)

1652
00:58:18,918 --> 00:58:20,720
- Let me start. - Go!

1653
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,235
- Start! - Let's end the game.

1654
00:58:25,492 --> 00:58:30,230
(Let me make up for all the humiliations.)

1655
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:32,485
Kwang Soo's lips are bleeding. Look at this.

1656
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:37,570
(The two team's fates depend on Kwang Soo's lips.)

1657
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,095
(This round will determine the winner of 2,680 dollars.)

1658
00:58:42,108 --> 00:58:46,995
(What will be the result?)

1659
00:58:51,184 --> 00:58:54,280
(The two team's fates depend on Kwang Soo's lips.)

1660
00:58:54,287 --> 00:58:58,805
(This round will determine the winner of 2,680 dollars.)

1661
00:58:58,825 --> 00:59:03,675
(What will be the result?)

1662
00:59:04,397 --> 00:59:06,585
- It's standing! - It's standing!

1663
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,500
- What? - It's standing!

1664
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,800
(The last puck is standing.)

1665
00:59:09,803 --> 00:59:11,770
- It doesn't count. - We decided it didn't count.

1666
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:13,540
We decided it didn't count earlier.

1667
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,640
- Look at this! - You said it doesn't count.

1668
00:59:15,642 --> 00:59:16,910
How can this be possible?

1669
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:19,240
- It doesn't count. - How could this happen?

1670
00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:20,910
- It flipped now. - I mean...

1671
00:59:20,914 --> 00:59:23,440
(Why...)

1672
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,710
(did I say that...)

1673
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:29,075
(in that situation?)

1674
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:32,390
Your team said it didn't count if the puck was standing.

1675
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:34,815
- Right. - Gosh. It's...

1676
00:59:34,994 --> 00:59:36,675
It's so annoying.

1677
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:38,560
Why is it standing?

1678
00:59:38,565 --> 00:59:39,730
(He's annoyed and frustrated.)

1679
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:41,715
Jong Kook, you're the best!

1680
00:59:41,868 --> 00:59:44,400
You're amazing. You made it happen.

1681
00:59:44,404 --> 00:59:45,700
(Ha Na showers Jong Kook with compliments.)

1682
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:48,800
Ha Na compliments others a lot.

1683
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:51,470
- Kim Jong Kook! - Let's do this!

1684
00:59:51,477 --> 00:59:52,810
Kim Jong Kook!

1685
00:59:52,812 --> 00:59:55,835
What if everything flips?

1686
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:57,780
I didn't know I'd be this nervous.

1687
00:59:57,784 --> 01:00:00,280
(Why are we so nervous?)

1688
01:00:00,286 --> 01:00:01,450
Good luck!

1689
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:03,120
(If you make a mistake, you lose.)

1690
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:07,160
(So Min puts the pressure on.)

1691
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,990
(Blowing)

1692
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:11,430
(Let's flip three at once.)

1693
01:00:11,431 --> 01:00:14,760
(He blows hard. What will happen?)

1694
01:00:14,767 --> 01:00:15,860
It's still left.

1695
01:00:15,869 --> 01:00:18,600
(She blocked it.)

1696
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:19,800
(Thanks to her defending, 1 puck didn't flip.)

1697
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:22,325
- There's 1 left. - There's 1 left!

1698
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:24,070
- This is great. - Good job.

1699
01:00:24,077 --> 01:00:25,540
- There's 1 left. - There's 1 left!

1700
01:00:25,545 --> 01:00:27,365
- This is great. - It's 1 to 1.

1701
01:00:27,513 --> 01:00:28,840
- Goodness. - Look.

1702
01:00:28,848 --> 01:00:31,450
It hit her face and went down.

1703
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:34,120
- What do I do? - One hit her face.

1704
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,620
- You can do it. - Let's go.

1705
01:00:35,622 --> 01:00:36,950
- You can do it. - You can do it.

1706
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:38,575
I'm so nervous.

1707
01:00:38,658 --> 01:00:40,420
So Min, this is the last one.

1708
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:42,945
- Last one! - If you can't do it now, it's over!

1709
01:00:43,496 --> 01:00:44,945
Let's go!

1710
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:46,715
Please.

1711
01:00:48,868 --> 01:00:51,530
(She blows lightly.)

1712
01:00:51,537 --> 01:00:52,670
- Please. - Please.

1713
01:00:52,672 --> 01:00:55,370
(Both teams' fates depend on So Min.)

1714
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,795
Please.

1715
01:00:58,244 --> 01:01:01,765
(What will the result be?)

1716
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:03,440
Did we win?

1717
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:04,750
(It flipped.)

1718
01:01:04,751 --> 01:01:05,850
- Did you do it? - Did we win?

1719
01:01:05,852 --> 01:01:08,875
(She floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee.)

1720
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:11,220
(The winner gets all the cash prize,)

1721
01:01:11,224 --> 01:01:16,075
(and the loser gets the penalty.)

1722
01:01:17,063 --> 01:01:18,930
- So Min. - We did it.

1723
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:22,860
- Captain Jeon. - Captain Jeon.

1724
01:01:22,869 --> 01:01:24,130
- Thank you. - So Min.

1725
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,755
You were awesome.

1726
01:01:25,972 --> 01:01:28,670
Team Face wins the match.

1727
01:01:28,675 --> 01:01:31,970
(Team Face earns 2,680 dollars and wins Flour Puck.)

1728
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:33,425
That was awesome.

1729
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:35,680
Please distribute...

1730
01:01:35,682 --> 01:01:37,805
- 2,680 dollars. - So Min.

1731
01:01:38,718 --> 01:01:39,880
- You know, right? - Captain Jeon.

1732
01:01:39,886 --> 01:01:41,520
We have to conclude this well.

1733
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:44,220
We can be happy. Don't think otherwise.

1734
01:01:44,223 --> 01:01:45,920
- We were one. - We were.

1735
01:01:45,925 --> 01:01:47,490
We were one during this game.

1736
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,415
How did we make it here?

1737
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:51,085
You have some on your eye.

1738
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:54,260
All right. They contributed.

1739
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,760
(To thank them for their contribution...)

1740
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:58,155
Seok Jin and...

1741
01:01:59,706 --> 01:02:01,540
(It's 4 to 4 to 2.)

1742
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:06,610
(She said she'd distribute the money to Seok Jin and Jae Seok.)

1743
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:08,480
(She pays Seok Jin and Jae Seok. Did she keep her promise?)

1744
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:10,095
That was a wise choice, right?

1745
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:14,975
(So Min allows Soo Hyang to check her balance.)

1746
01:02:15,722 --> 01:02:19,175
(I trust the captain. Let's see.)

1747
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:20,660
How much did we win?

1748
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,420
- 2,680 dollars. - 2,680?

1749
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:25,615
20... 2,680?

1750
01:02:26,599 --> 01:02:32,125
(She only gave me 200 dollars?)

1751
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:37,910
So Min.

1752
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:38,970
- Why? - Was it bad?

1753
01:02:38,978 --> 01:02:40,740
I think she took it all.

1754
01:02:40,747 --> 01:02:44,010
- She was so fair. - Really?

1755
01:02:44,017 --> 01:02:47,020
I was being fair. I followed my pledge.

1756
01:02:47,020 --> 01:02:48,550
- You said 4 to 4 to 2. - Did you do it?

1757
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:50,150
I considered your contributions too.

1758
01:02:50,156 --> 01:02:51,920
- She considered it a lot. - Right.

1759
01:02:51,924 --> 01:02:53,150
Really?

1760
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:54,775
In the game.

1761
01:02:54,827 --> 01:02:57,560
Team Voice has a candidate for captain.

1762
01:02:57,563 --> 01:03:01,230
(Team Voice has a candidate for captain.)

1763
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:02,600
- When? - When?

1764
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:04,225
In such a short time?

1765
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:05,470
Is it you, Se Chan?

1766
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,570
- No? - What? Do you think it's me?

1767
01:03:07,573 --> 01:03:09,400
- I knew it. - Me too.

1768
01:03:09,409 --> 01:03:10,910
The candidate's name is...

1769
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,170
(The candidate's name is...)

1770
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,980
Haha.

1771
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:17,250
(The candidate's name is Haha.)

1772
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,010
(I'm the candidate.)

1773
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:21,250
The towel...

1774
01:03:21,254 --> 01:03:22,780
(During the puck game,)

1775
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:25,390
(he pretended like he was taking a towel from his cameraman...)

1776
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:31,190
(when nobody was paying attention.)

1777
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:33,530
(A revolt is bold and secretive.)

1778
01:03:33,533 --> 01:03:35,030
He's ambitious.

1779
01:03:35,034 --> 01:03:36,860
- He always dreams of betrayal. - Right.

1780
01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:39,630
(Goodness, it was Haha.)

1781
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:41,640
I did this to save the team.

1782
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:44,470
We'll all die like this. There must be a way.

1783
01:03:44,477 --> 01:03:47,410
I want to discuss that with you...

1784
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:50,750
and win together.

1785
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,850
That sounds appealing.

1786
01:03:51,851 --> 01:03:53,750
I'm convinced.

1787
01:03:53,753 --> 01:03:56,375
Trust me.

1788
01:03:57,223 --> 01:03:59,390
I'm about to tear up.

1789
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:00,990
Oh, gosh.

1790
01:04:00,993 --> 01:04:02,420
You did your best.

1791
01:04:02,428 --> 01:04:03,930
Haha.

1792
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:05,160
No, actually.

1793
01:04:05,164 --> 01:04:06,490
Just pick me.

1794
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:09,200
Pick me.

1795
01:04:09,202 --> 01:04:10,630
- What's your reason? - Why?

1796
01:04:10,636 --> 01:04:12,555
(Why should we keep trusting you?)

1797
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:13,770
I'll make you laugh.

1798
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:15,895
(That was random.)

1799
01:04:15,942 --> 01:04:17,040
In the end...

1800
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:18,640
Will we be so speechless that we end up laughing?

1801
01:04:18,644 --> 01:04:20,010
"Goodness".

1802
01:04:20,012 --> 01:04:21,180
- You got it. - We'll be speechless.

1803
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,680
I think...

1804
01:04:22,682 --> 01:04:24,010
she'll make you laugh...

1805
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:25,510
on the ride back home.

1806
01:04:25,518 --> 01:04:26,710
"Gosh, Ha Na".

1807
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:28,620
(Goodness)

1808
01:04:28,621 --> 01:04:30,520
- That's it. - Right.

1809
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:31,550
"Goodness".

1810
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:34,420
We're doing this to have a good time, right?

1811
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:37,330
At this rate, we'll be laughing until tomorrow morning.

1812
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,015
Right when we wake up.

1813
01:04:39,632 --> 01:04:41,885
All right. Let's do this.

1814
01:04:42,135 --> 01:04:44,700
If Haha doesn't get picked,

1815
01:04:44,704 --> 01:04:46,630
- he'll fall out of favor. - Right.

1816
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:48,155
Here's the result.

1817
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:51,065
Team Voice's new captain...

1818
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:54,295
has been unanimously changed to...

1819
01:04:54,447 --> 01:04:56,080
Haha.

1820
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:57,750
(Haha has been voted unanimously.)

1821
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,205
Really?

1822
01:04:59,352 --> 01:05:01,280
(Haha gets elected as the captain.)

1823
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:03,020
Ha Na got ousted.

1824
01:05:03,022 --> 01:05:04,550
(That means she voted for Haha too.)

1825
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:07,160
- This is so beautiful. - I'm sorry,

1826
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,320
but can I have the badge?

1827
01:05:08,327 --> 01:05:11,915
(Stop talking.)

1828
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:13,930
She's shaking her head and saying it's beautiful.

1829
01:05:13,933 --> 01:05:15,360
"This is so beautiful."

1830
01:05:15,368 --> 01:05:17,900
It's the opposite. She talks and behaves differently.

1831
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:19,100
(She's unique in that she talks and behaves in opposite ways.)

1832
01:05:19,105 --> 01:05:20,625
Try your best.

1833
01:05:20,773 --> 01:05:21,970
Thank you.

1834
01:05:21,974 --> 01:05:24,070
Ha Na is so cute.

1835
01:05:24,076 --> 01:05:25,810
He was awesome.

1836
01:05:25,811 --> 01:05:28,195
You can all check your balances.

1837
01:05:28,347 --> 01:05:30,440
- Let's go. - Let's check.

1838
01:05:30,449 --> 01:05:31,835
(Since it's unanimous, they can all check.)

1839
01:05:32,785 --> 01:05:35,620
Ha Na is not coming, so she must feel bad.

1840
01:05:35,621 --> 01:05:41,015
(She's loitering. Is she sad or does she feel guilty?)

1841
01:05:44,997 --> 01:05:47,445
No, this isn't it. Give me the switched amount.

1842
01:05:47,867 --> 01:05:49,355
- Sorry? - That's the switched amount.

1843
01:05:50,102 --> 01:05:51,825
- Stop joking. - I'm serious.

1844
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:53,885
Give it back once you're done.

1845
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,800
- Hold on. - Hold on.

1846
01:05:55,808 --> 01:05:57,255
(Did something happen to the new captain's balance?)

1847
01:05:57,476 --> 01:06:00,580
(Minus 400 dollars)

1848
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,695
(Minus 1,230 dollars!)

1849
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:08,020
(The entire loan is under Haha's name.)

1850
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,150
Haha.

1851
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:10,635
Look at him.

1852
01:06:11,224 --> 01:06:12,220
Haha...

1853
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:14,745
(What happened to the balance?)

1854
01:06:15,728 --> 01:06:17,860
(Will you trust me?)

1855
01:06:17,863 --> 01:06:19,830
(Everybody trusted her.)

1856
01:06:19,832 --> 01:06:22,500
I'll do this for now.

1857
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:24,555
I'll watch Se Chan for a bit.

1858
01:06:25,638 --> 01:06:27,400
I'll distribute it equally.

1859
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:28,825
(She distributed the cash prize from Round 1 equally.)

1860
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:30,200
She's honest.

1861
01:06:30,209 --> 01:06:32,640
(Se Chan checked how honest she was.)

1862
01:06:32,645 --> 01:06:37,835
(He mentioned the possibility of somebody having no money.)

1863
01:06:38,217 --> 01:06:42,475
(She felt threatened and made a decision.)

1864
01:06:42,555 --> 01:06:43,780
I have to switch.

1865
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:46,775
(I'll give all to the traitor.)

1866
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:52,090
(She put all the loan under her name.)

1867
01:06:52,098 --> 01:06:53,845
What are you doing?

1868
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:56,460
Stop playing with me.

1869
01:06:56,469 --> 01:06:58,725
Give me the new balance.

1870
01:06:59,038 --> 01:07:00,270
Is this a drama?

1871
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,600
(This is unbelievable.)

1872
01:07:01,607 --> 01:07:03,970
Are there people like this in the world?

1873
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:05,970
Haha, try to look cool and walk back.

1874
01:07:05,978 --> 01:07:07,170
It's not too late.

1875
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:09,265
You have a lot of loans, right?

1876
01:07:09,348 --> 01:07:11,565
Is she a swindler?

1877
01:07:12,351 --> 01:07:14,320
(You should have trusted me.)

1878
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:17,180
- Is she a good or bad person? - Is she good?

1879
01:07:17,189 --> 01:07:19,445
She predicted this?

1880
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:21,190
I don't think she predicted it.

1881
01:07:21,193 --> 01:07:23,775
- She was nice and was fortunate. - Right.

1882
01:07:24,597 --> 01:07:28,160
(He fell victim to his own scheme. The new captain takes the loan.)

1883
01:07:28,167 --> 01:07:33,085
(Round 2 is over. It's time to move onto the final round.)

1884
01:07:33,606 --> 01:07:35,995
(This is the final mission!)

1885
01:07:36,609 --> 01:07:38,170
It's Legendary Treasure Hunt.

1886
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:39,870
(This is the last chance to win additional cash prize.)

1887
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:41,335
A treasure hunt?

1888
01:07:41,847 --> 01:07:43,335
A treasure hunt?

1889
01:07:43,382 --> 01:07:45,205
- Can I turn the tables? - It sounds fun.

1890
01:07:45,718 --> 01:07:48,020
You take turns attacking and defending.

1891
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,880
The defending team has...

1892
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:52,620
20 minutes to find the hidden cash prize.

1893
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,560
The attacking team will have bells attached to them.

1894
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,745
You have to eliminate the defending team by ripping their name tags.

1895
01:07:57,863 --> 01:07:59,090
(Name Tag Elimination?)

1896
01:07:59,098 --> 01:08:00,800
It's Name Tag Elimination.

1897
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,470
If the captain finds the cash prize, the amount is doubled.

1898
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:07,125
(If the captain finds the prize, the amount is doubled.)

1899
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,670
You have to find it.

1900
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:11,040
The captain has to find more.

1901
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:13,310
However, if the entire defending team...

1902
01:08:13,312 --> 01:08:15,340
gets eliminated before the time is over...

1903
01:08:15,348 --> 01:08:18,210
or if the captain gets eliminated, the race is over.

1904
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:19,905
Is it over if the captain is eliminated?

1905
01:08:20,186 --> 01:08:21,220
This is all you.

1906
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,920
If I get eliminated, this is over?

1907
01:08:22,922 --> 01:08:25,405
We have to protect the captain.

1908
01:08:25,524 --> 01:08:27,220
I'm in trouble. What do I do?

1909
01:08:27,226 --> 01:08:28,875
I'm weak.

1910
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:32,645
- I want to win. - Me too.

1911
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:35,085
- This is the most important round. - That's true.

1912
01:08:35,101 --> 01:08:36,300
We have to redeem ourselves.

1913
01:08:36,302 --> 01:08:39,330
Even if we get eliminated, we have to find a lot of cash prize first.

1914
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:41,495
Haha, you should...

1915
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:43,670
go around with Se Chan.

1916
01:08:43,676 --> 01:08:45,640
Go around with Jong Kook. I'll look for the cash prize.

1917
01:08:45,644 --> 01:08:47,880
Haha has to look for it,

1918
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,180
and I'll be right behind him.

1919
01:08:49,181 --> 01:08:50,910
I can grab two people.

1920
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,510
(Trust me.)

1921
01:08:52,518 --> 01:08:54,050
All right.

1922
01:08:54,053 --> 01:08:56,180
They have Jong Kook, so they have the advantage.

1923
01:08:56,188 --> 01:08:58,175
- What do I do? - I know.

1924
01:08:58,591 --> 01:09:00,545
We have to eliminate him quickly.

1925
01:09:00,693 --> 01:09:02,220
Jae Seok, we have to eliminate him first.

1926
01:09:02,228 --> 01:09:03,960
- How? - But then...

1927
01:09:03,963 --> 01:09:05,090
We have to eliminate the captain.

1928
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:07,090
He'll be going around with Jong Kook. I'm sure.

1929
01:09:07,099 --> 01:09:08,985
How do we get rid of him?

1930
01:09:09,168 --> 01:09:10,430
How does he die?

1931
01:09:10,436 --> 01:09:12,625
We have to stop him from finding the treasures.

1932
01:09:12,738 --> 01:09:14,370
We have the disadvantage. We're in trouble.

1933
01:09:14,373 --> 01:09:16,995
(Those looking for the treasures versus those preventing them)

1934
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:20,665
- I'll count down. - Go down.

1935
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,765
(Try if you can.)

1936
01:09:23,082 --> 01:09:24,850
- Was it 20 minutes? - Yes.

1937
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:26,410
(The teams' fates depend on the captains.)

1938
01:09:26,419 --> 01:09:27,935
Two...

1939
01:09:28,154 --> 01:09:29,420
- One. - Go.

1940
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:30,580
- Start. - Okay.

1941
01:09:30,589 --> 01:09:34,420
(The grand finale, Legendary Treasure Hunt, starts.)

1942
01:09:34,427 --> 01:09:35,690
Let's go, Haha.

1943
01:09:35,694 --> 01:09:37,445
There. Let's go.

1944
01:09:37,797 --> 01:09:39,415
I think it'll be down there.

1945
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:41,800
- Come here. - Good luck.

1946
01:09:41,801 --> 01:09:43,685
- Good luck. Go that way. - Let's go.

1947
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:47,230
(They go as fast as they can.)

1948
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:49,940
- You have to run away from them. - Okay.

1949
01:09:49,942 --> 01:09:51,470
- You can't be eliminated. - Okay.

1950
01:09:51,477 --> 01:09:52,810
I don't see it.

1951
01:09:52,812 --> 01:09:55,965
(Where are the treasures?)

1952
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,905
(What's that?)

1953
01:10:00,219 --> 01:10:01,320
I found it.

1954
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,575
(She finds a treasure in 1 minute.)

1955
01:10:04,123 --> 01:10:06,745
- I found it. - Okay! Gosh, she's fast.

1956
01:10:07,226 --> 01:10:09,860
(The 1st treasure is 500 dollars.)

1957
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:11,030
Ji Hyo, good job.

1958
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:13,285
- Put it away. - Haha should have found it.

1959
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:14,730
I will put it away.

1960
01:10:14,733 --> 01:10:16,285
(It's too bad Haha didn't find it.)

1961
01:10:16,769 --> 01:10:18,130
- Which way should I go? - Hurry up.

1962
01:10:18,137 --> 01:10:20,070
(If Haha finds a treasure, the amount of money is doubled.)

1963
01:10:20,072 --> 01:10:22,100
Go. Keep going.

1964
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:24,440
- Which way should I go? - Haha! Come here!

1965
01:10:24,443 --> 01:10:26,240
Haha! Come here!

1966
01:10:26,245 --> 01:10:28,365
Here. There is a treasure.

1967
01:10:28,414 --> 01:10:29,480
You should get it.

1968
01:10:29,482 --> 01:10:30,710
Okay.

1969
01:10:30,716 --> 01:10:32,850
Gosh, it's perfectly hidden from the view.

1970
01:10:32,852 --> 01:10:34,935
- Okay. I got it. - Let's go.

1971
01:10:36,422 --> 01:10:37,850
- How much is it? - 300 dollars.

1972
01:10:37,857 --> 01:10:39,520
Okay. Okay.

1973
01:10:39,525 --> 01:10:40,590
That's incredible.

1974
01:10:40,593 --> 01:10:42,960
It's meaningless for us to split up.

1975
01:10:42,962 --> 01:10:44,660
- That's right. - We should stay together.

1976
01:10:44,663 --> 01:10:46,090
If we split up, we won't be able to remove the name tags.

1977
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:48,160
- We just need to get the captain. - That's right.

1978
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:50,900
The captain will be protected...

1979
01:10:50,903 --> 01:10:53,125
- by Jong Kook. - Jong Kook will stay by his side.

1980
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:56,540
Who will stay by Captain Jeon's side?

1981
01:10:56,542 --> 01:10:58,610
- Seriously. - I think...

1982
01:10:58,611 --> 01:10:59,670
So Min should take care of herself.

1983
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:00,910
- So Min. - Take care of yourself.

1984
01:11:00,913 --> 01:11:02,340
You should hide underground.

1985
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:04,705
(Why don't you dig a hole in the ground?)

1986
01:11:05,217 --> 01:11:07,350
We need to find the treasures.

1987
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:08,350
(Unlike the relaxed Team Face,)

1988
01:11:08,354 --> 01:11:09,650
(Team Voice focuses on finding the treasures.)

1989
01:11:09,655 --> 01:11:10,720
- Where is it? - I found one!

1990
01:11:10,723 --> 01:11:11,750
Did you find one? Okay.

1991
01:11:11,757 --> 01:11:13,590
(She finds one.)

1992
01:11:13,592 --> 01:11:15,290
- 100 dollars. - Okay.

1993
01:11:15,294 --> 01:11:16,915
100 dollars. Okay.

1994
01:11:17,663 --> 01:11:19,560
- Okay. - Did you find one?

1995
01:11:19,565 --> 01:11:20,590
(Team Voice prepares to turn the tables.)

1996
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:21,985
Ha Na.

1997
01:11:23,269 --> 01:11:24,330
- My goodness. - Let's go.

1998
01:11:24,336 --> 01:11:26,470
Good job. Good job.

1999
01:11:26,472 --> 01:11:27,995
There might be more.

2000
01:11:28,173 --> 01:11:30,470
The atmosphere is friendly.

2001
01:11:30,476 --> 01:11:33,810
You know, our team is too weak.

2002
01:11:33,812 --> 01:11:36,110
- Our team... - It's okay. We are doing well.

2003
01:11:36,115 --> 01:11:38,050
We are winning. Let's defend our position.

2004
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:40,550
We don't need to do anything. We just need to defend our position.

2005
01:11:40,553 --> 01:11:41,850
We are winning.

2006
01:11:41,854 --> 01:11:43,235
(The best offense is a good defense.)

2007
01:11:43,422 --> 01:11:47,220
(The time passes.)

2008
01:11:47,226 --> 01:11:49,215
- There they are! - Where?

2009
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:50,890
There.

2010
01:11:50,896 --> 01:11:52,860
- Come here. - Haha.

2011
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:53,830
Haha is there as well.

2012
01:11:53,832 --> 01:11:55,455
- Really? - Haha is there as well.

2013
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:58,000
Haha, come here.

2014
01:11:58,003 --> 01:12:01,325
(Unaware of the danger, they keep searching.)

2015
01:12:02,474 --> 01:12:03,995
Let's take off his name tag.

2016
01:12:05,144 --> 01:12:06,810
Let's go. Let's go.

2017
01:12:06,812 --> 01:12:08,980
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2018
01:12:08,981 --> 01:12:10,410
- Hold on. Be careful. - Let's go.

2019
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,850
- Be careful. - Let's go.

2020
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,750
(The sound of the approaching bells...)

2021
01:12:14,753 --> 01:12:16,820
(is noticed by Haha.)

2022
01:12:16,822 --> 01:12:17,820
Jong Kook!

2023
01:12:17,823 --> 01:12:19,745
- What? - They are coming.

2024
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:21,775
- They are coming. - Come here.

2025
01:12:21,794 --> 01:12:22,920
This is...

2026
01:12:22,928 --> 01:12:26,115
(He has to find the treasures and protect the captain.)

2027
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:28,560
- Se Chan, keep looking. - Okay.

2028
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:30,585
(Ha Na looks for the treasures on the other side...)

2029
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:34,000
(and finds Kwang Soo.)

2030
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:35,500
Come here, Ha Na. Let's run away.

2031
01:12:35,507 --> 01:12:37,325
(She lures Kwang Soo away from the captain.)

2032
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,225
There she is!

2033
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:41,610
Run! Catch Haha! You need to catch Haha!

2034
01:12:41,614 --> 01:12:42,680
They are going that way.

2035
01:12:42,681 --> 01:12:45,050
(He suddenly turns towards Haha.)

2036
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,705
Be careful.

2037
01:12:46,885 --> 01:12:48,320
Take out the captain.

2038
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,675
(Our target is the captain.)

2039
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:51,945
(He hears the command.)

2040
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:53,720
(Haha and Jong Kook are trapped.)

2041
01:12:53,726 --> 01:12:56,075
- Go to the other side. - Be careful.

2042
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:58,415
It will be over once we take Haha out.

2043
01:12:59,431 --> 01:13:00,930
They are coming.

2044
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:02,615
Where is the way?

2045
01:13:02,668 --> 01:13:04,160
Is there no way out?

2046
01:13:04,169 --> 01:13:05,770
They are trapped.

2047
01:13:05,771 --> 01:13:07,600
- Go that way. - Let's go up.

2048
01:13:07,606 --> 01:13:08,670
Let's go up.

2049
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:09,800
I will fend them off.

2050
01:13:09,808 --> 01:13:11,665
It will be over once we take Haha out!

2051
01:13:12,544 --> 01:13:15,280
(They run to the forest.)

2052
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,810
There they are.

2053
01:13:16,815 --> 01:13:18,010
Be careful.

2054
01:13:18,017 --> 01:13:21,720
(The 5 members of Team Face surround the 2 of them.)

2055
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,075
(You can't pass.)

2056
01:13:25,557 --> 01:13:27,020
- Take him out. - Hurry up and go.

2057
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:28,390
Get Haha. You need to get Haha.

2058
01:13:28,394 --> 01:13:29,860
(Jong Kook stops Jae Seok and Kwang Soo.)

2059
01:13:29,862 --> 01:13:31,215
Get Haha.

2060
01:13:31,397 --> 01:13:33,330
Go to the other side!

2061
01:13:33,332 --> 01:13:34,400
Get Haha!

2062
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,600
(While Jong Kook stops the others, Haha runs.)

2063
01:13:36,602 --> 01:13:38,000
Get Haha.

2064
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:39,930
Get Haha. Come on.

2065
01:13:39,938 --> 01:13:42,195
Run, Haha.

2066
01:13:42,241 --> 01:13:44,025
- Go. - Run, Haha.

2067
01:13:44,143 --> 01:13:45,510
He is going to the other side!

2068
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:50,235
(Jong Kook stops Kwang Soo from pursuing Haha.)

2069
01:13:51,817 --> 01:13:53,010
- Gosh, he is so fast. - Hurry!

2070
01:13:53,018 --> 01:13:54,050
(Haha,)

2071
01:13:54,053 --> 01:13:58,175
(are you running away?)

2072
01:13:58,223 --> 01:14:01,420
Hurry up. Soo Hyang, stop panting and take off his name tag!

2073
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:02,560
(I am okay as long as you are safe.)

2074
01:14:02,561 --> 01:14:03,945
Take off Jong Kook's name tag.

2075
01:14:04,163 --> 01:14:07,230
Hurry up. Take off Jong Kook's name tag.

2076
01:14:07,232 --> 01:14:10,455
(I am happy that I got to save you.)

2077
01:14:10,903 --> 01:14:13,525
(Jong Kook, thank you.)

2078
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:15,570
Take off Jong Kook's name tag.

2079
01:14:15,574 --> 01:14:17,470
Take off Jong Kook's name tag. You did it.

2080
01:14:17,476 --> 01:14:18,640
(He protects Haha and gets taken out.)

2081
01:14:18,644 --> 01:14:20,470
- Good job, Soo Hyang. - Did Haha run away?

2082
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:22,495
- He ran away. - Thank goodness.

2083
01:14:23,048 --> 01:14:24,140
Which way did he go?

2084
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:25,480
(I wonder who will protect Haha now.)

2085
01:14:25,484 --> 01:14:26,865
Haha is fast.

2086
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,775
(This is a disaster.)

2087
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,720
Kim Jong Kook is out.

2088
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:34,645
(The hero is out.)

2089
01:14:35,494 --> 01:14:38,385
We have to find the treasures fast. We have to find them.

2090
01:14:39,364 --> 01:14:41,900
The other team is chasing after Haha.

2091
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,485
- Really? - We have to...

2092
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:44,730
We have to find the treasures fast.

2093
01:14:44,737 --> 01:14:46,230
(To turn the tables, they must find the treasures.)

2094
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:47,870
- Okay. - I found it,

2095
01:14:47,873 --> 01:14:49,140
- but we should... - We can't get Haha.

2096
01:14:49,141 --> 01:14:50,270
We should...

2097
01:14:50,275 --> 01:14:52,610
We must find the treasures fast before Haha gets eliminated.

2098
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:54,165
(While Ha Na and Se Chan find the treasures,)

2099
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,065
(Ji Hyo finds one as well.)

2100
01:14:58,517 --> 01:15:02,375
(They still have a chance to turn the tables.)

2101
01:15:02,988 --> 01:15:04,020
My ankles hurt.

2102
01:15:04,022 --> 01:15:06,220
(Captain Haha manages to escape.)

2103
01:15:06,225 --> 01:15:09,115
(He is really nervous without Jong Kook.)

2104
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:13,115
(Where is Haha?)

2105
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:17,985
(It's Haha!)

2106
01:15:18,771 --> 01:15:19,770
(He doesn't get to take a breather.)

2107
01:15:19,772 --> 01:15:21,285
There he is!

2108
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,670
Go to the opposite direction!

2109
01:15:22,674 --> 01:15:24,865
(Jae Seok joins in.)

2110
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:27,765
(Stop right there.)

2111
01:15:27,913 --> 01:15:30,010
Keep going! We must get Haha!

2112
01:15:30,015 --> 01:15:33,580
(Haha without Jong Kook is like Pororo without his glasses.)

2113
01:15:33,585 --> 01:15:34,720
Hold on.

2114
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:36,380
Let me go this once.

2115
01:15:36,388 --> 01:15:37,775
(Come on.)

2116
01:15:38,223 --> 01:15:40,190
- This is the last round. - We have no choice.

2117
01:15:40,192 --> 01:15:43,245
(Jong Kook, where are you? I miss you.)

2118
01:15:43,428 --> 01:15:47,615
(I wish I weren't eliminated.)

2119
01:15:48,433 --> 01:15:50,300
Jae Seok, please.

2120
01:15:50,302 --> 01:15:51,855
(Haha misses him dearly.)

2121
01:15:52,104 --> 01:15:53,370
(Captain Haha is out.)

2122
01:15:53,372 --> 01:15:54,430
The end!

2123
01:15:54,439 --> 01:15:57,225
(Team Voice's treasure hunt ends.)

2124
01:15:57,976 --> 01:16:01,840
(I hope the members found a lot of treasures.)

2125
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:02,880
This is a disaster.

2126
01:16:02,881 --> 01:16:05,635
Round One is over. The teams will switch positions.

2127
01:16:06,084 --> 01:16:07,210
You saw that, right?

2128
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:09,380
- We did it. - We were cool.

2129
01:16:09,388 --> 01:16:10,820
Our team is really strong.

2130
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:12,050
I didn't think that would be the case.

2131
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:13,990
Seriously.

2132
01:16:13,992 --> 01:16:16,415
- You know who helped, right? - Who helped?

2133
01:16:16,762 --> 01:16:19,360
- Soo Hyang is the difference. - I am the new face.

2134
01:16:19,364 --> 01:16:21,985
Jong Kook must be mad.

2135
01:16:23,101 --> 01:16:24,330
I should finish them off.

2136
01:16:24,336 --> 01:16:25,630
(I want my revenge.)

2137
01:16:25,637 --> 01:16:28,525
He might rip off your back along with the name tag.

2138
01:16:28,974 --> 01:16:29,970
That's scary.

2139
01:16:29,975 --> 01:16:31,665
Be careful. He is mad.

2140
01:16:31,944 --> 01:16:33,140
(I am sure he will go for my name tag first.)

2141
01:16:33,145 --> 01:16:34,980
Our team is the best.

2142
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,010
- Our team is the best. - That's right.

2143
01:16:36,014 --> 01:16:37,640
- Yes. - This is so much fun.

2144
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:38,880
Right?

2145
01:16:38,884 --> 01:16:41,720
Let's begin the treasure hunt.

2146
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:44,050
The two of you should take this side.

2147
01:16:44,056 --> 01:16:45,120
We will meet in the end...

2148
01:16:45,123 --> 01:16:46,190
(Team Voice plans the attack.)

2149
01:16:46,191 --> 01:16:47,575
so that they can't run away.

2150
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,390
Taking off So Min's name tag would be the best.

2151
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:52,760
- Okay. - We must remove her name tag.

2152
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:55,260
We can't let them get more money.

2153
01:16:55,267 --> 01:16:57,100
- That's right. - We found...

2154
01:16:57,102 --> 01:16:58,930
a considerable amount of money.

2155
01:16:58,937 --> 01:17:00,355
That's right.

2156
01:17:00,372 --> 01:17:03,300
We must take out So Min or the other members...

2157
01:17:03,308 --> 01:17:04,500
before they find the treasures.

2158
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:05,510
We must take off their name tags.

2159
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:07,525
Let's take out whomever we find first.

2160
01:17:07,546 --> 01:17:08,965
Okay.

2161
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:11,180
Round Two starts now.

2162
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:12,705
(Team Voice is attacking, and Team Face is defending.)

2163
01:17:13,018 --> 01:17:14,565
Let's go.

2164
01:17:14,653 --> 01:17:16,035
Let's go, let's go.

2165
01:17:16,421 --> 01:17:17,550
Let's go, let's go.

2166
01:17:17,556 --> 01:17:18,720
(They run at full speed.)

2167
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:20,550
It's dangerous for us to stay together.

2168
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:21,990
- What should we do? - Let's split up.

2169
01:17:21,994 --> 01:17:23,120
So Min, it would be better for you to hide.

2170
01:17:23,128 --> 01:17:24,575
Where should I hide?

2171
01:17:25,163 --> 01:17:26,390
Behind the toilet?

2172
01:17:26,398 --> 01:17:27,730
Hide behind the toilet.

2173
01:17:27,733 --> 01:17:28,760
Behind the toilet?

2174
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:29,760
(I am sure no one will know.)

2175
01:17:29,768 --> 01:17:31,130
Hide behind the toilet.

2176
01:17:31,136 --> 01:17:33,970
It will be too smelly.

2177
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:34,970
Go behind the toilet.

2178
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:37,095
She is incredible.

2179
01:17:37,175 --> 01:17:39,970
(For the team, I can endure the smell.)

2180
01:17:39,978 --> 01:17:42,165
- Kwang Soo, stay by her side. - Okay.

2181
01:17:43,115 --> 01:17:45,065
- Let's find the treasures. - Let's find them.

2182
01:17:45,083 --> 01:17:47,010
- Go that way. I will go this way. - Okay.

2183
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:48,480
(Seok Jin, Jae Seok, and Soo Hyang go looking for the treasures.)

2184
01:17:48,487 --> 01:17:51,745
This is the perfect place to hide the treasures.

2185
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:55,560
(The members of Team Voice split up to find So Min.)

2186
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,075
I will go up this way.

2187
01:17:59,464 --> 01:18:02,955
(So Min, where are you?)

2188
01:18:03,802 --> 01:18:07,825
(They search every nook and cranny.)

2189
01:18:08,607 --> 01:18:09,870
It's too smelly here.

2190
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,310
It's too smelly here. What should I do?

2191
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,165
- This is too much. - It is.

2192
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:15,565
I feel like there is poop right in front of my nose.

2193
01:18:15,681 --> 01:18:17,680
No one will find us if we stay here.

2194
01:18:17,683 --> 01:18:19,210
- Gosh, it's smelly. - I feel like I am going to puke.

2195
01:18:19,217 --> 01:18:21,010
(There is a possibility the smell will knock them out.)

2196
01:18:21,019 --> 01:18:22,405
For goodness' sake.

2197
01:18:22,754 --> 01:18:26,390
(She heads to the smelly place.)

2198
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:28,520
- Move closer to the wall. - Move closer.

2199
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:30,060
- Move closer to the wall. - Come on.

2200
01:18:30,062 --> 01:18:31,575
(Don't let them see you.)

2201
01:18:32,431 --> 01:18:34,645
If we get caught, I will stop them.

2202
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,315
- You should go up that way. - That way?

2203
01:18:38,103 --> 01:18:39,485
Okay.

2204
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:43,225
(Is she hiding in here?)

2205
01:18:45,377 --> 01:18:48,695
(Even Jong Kook approaches the toilet.)

2206
01:18:49,915 --> 01:18:52,435
(This is bad.)

2207
01:18:53,285 --> 01:18:56,375
(She searches inside the toilet.)

2208
01:18:56,989 --> 01:19:00,705
(The extreme tension numbs their sense of smell.)

2209
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:06,230
(Their hearts beat faster than the sound of the bells.)

2210
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:08,185
It would be absurd.

2211
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,985
(Is she behind the toilet?)

2212
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,795
(She isn't here.)

2213
01:19:21,613 --> 01:19:24,195
(Her heart almost stops.)

2214
01:19:25,784 --> 01:19:27,835
I am sure she is hiding somewhere.

2215
01:19:29,021 --> 01:19:30,575
She's going away.

2216
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:34,975
(I think that took 10 years off my life.)

2217
01:19:35,527 --> 01:19:37,120
It wouldn't be here, right?

2218
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:39,790
(Soo Hyang is looking for the treasures.)

2219
01:19:39,798 --> 01:19:40,930
By the way,

2220
01:19:40,932 --> 01:19:42,030
(In the middle of the treasure hunt)

2221
01:19:42,034 --> 01:19:43,415
this is nice.

2222
01:19:44,336 --> 01:19:46,130
Fall is here.

2223
01:19:46,138 --> 01:19:48,495
(She fully enjoys the phytoncide and the mood of fall.)

2224
01:19:49,374 --> 01:19:50,800
The air is really nice.

2225
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:52,670
(She has all the time in the world.)

2226
01:19:52,677 --> 01:19:55,535
The weather is the treasure.

2227
01:19:57,783 --> 01:20:01,605
(Isn't it a good day to get your name tag ripped off?)

2228
01:20:01,653 --> 01:20:02,650
Hold on.

2229
01:20:02,654 --> 01:20:04,735
(Screaming)

2230
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:08,775
(How dare you take off my name tag? I'm gunning for you.)

2231
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:10,420
(Did you think you'd be okay?)

2232
01:20:10,429 --> 01:20:12,660
Wait. Hold on.

2233
01:20:12,664 --> 01:20:14,330
(Eye for an eye.)

2234
01:20:14,332 --> 01:20:15,755
No!

2235
01:20:15,801 --> 01:20:16,830
I'm sorry.

2236
01:20:16,835 --> 01:20:18,825
(He successfully gets his revenge.)

2237
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:20,470
- That was unbelievable. - Here you go.

2238
01:20:20,472 --> 01:20:21,870
(Trembling)

2239
01:20:21,873 --> 01:20:23,440
That was so scary.

2240
01:20:23,442 --> 01:20:24,795
(Trembling)

2241
01:20:25,944 --> 01:20:28,695
That was so scary. He completely got his revenge.

2242
01:20:29,047 --> 01:20:31,495
(Now that I'm done with my revenge, let's go find So Min.)

2243
01:20:32,584 --> 01:20:33,580
(Meanwhile...)

2244
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:35,250
- I checked that part earlier. - You did?

2245
01:20:35,253 --> 01:20:37,405
(Meanwhile, Ha Na, Haha, and Se Chan are looking for So Min.)

2246
01:20:38,056 --> 01:20:39,050
(They already checked most of the places.)

2247
01:20:39,057 --> 01:20:40,920
Let's go this way.

2248
01:20:40,926 --> 01:20:42,720
- The restroom? - No.

2249
01:20:42,727 --> 01:20:44,115
Let's hurry.

2250
01:20:45,097 --> 01:20:47,515
(What?)

2251
01:20:48,266 --> 01:20:50,385
(Let's check it out for now.)

2252
01:20:50,569 --> 01:20:51,925
The restroom?

2253
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:53,270
(It's coming.)

2254
01:20:53,271 --> 01:20:55,970
(The sound of their bells are coming close.)

2255
01:20:55,974 --> 01:20:57,640
The restroom? Are they in the restroom?

2256
01:20:57,642 --> 01:20:59,595
Ha Na, I already checked.

2257
01:20:59,878 --> 01:21:00,910
You did?

2258
01:21:00,912 --> 01:21:02,110
(Just in case,)

2259
01:21:02,114 --> 01:21:03,180
(she checks the back.)

2260
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:04,210
Are they in the back?

2261
01:21:04,216 --> 01:21:05,565
(They're totally meticulous.)

2262
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:09,875
(What? Did he say, "back"?)

2263
01:21:10,589 --> 01:21:13,345
(What should we do?)

2264
01:21:16,728 --> 01:21:19,285
(I found them!)

2265
01:21:20,599 --> 01:21:24,615
(She finds Captain So Min who was in hiding at last.)

2266
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:26,300
(Kwang Soo blocks Ha Na and Se Chan.)

2267
01:21:26,304 --> 01:21:27,630
- Catch her. - Hold on. Let me go.

2268
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:29,925
- Go, Ha Na. You should go. - Run away.

2269
01:21:30,008 --> 01:21:32,970
- So Min, run away! - Kwang Soo is out.

2270
01:21:32,978 --> 01:21:34,040
Climb up.

2271
01:21:34,045 --> 01:21:35,340
(It's impossible to stop Haha too.)

2272
01:21:35,347 --> 01:21:36,340
- Go! - No!

2273
01:21:36,348 --> 01:21:37,710
- So Min. - Hold on a second.

2274
01:21:37,716 --> 01:21:40,010
Hit them. Kick them!

2275
01:21:40,018 --> 01:21:41,310
No, not yet.

2276
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:43,020
- So Min, run! - No!

2277
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,580
- So Min, kick them! - Okay, I'll go down.

2278
01:21:44,589 --> 01:21:47,275
(Ha Na gets close to So Min while So Min is resisting.)

2279
01:21:48,226 --> 01:21:51,315
(She held out even if it meant she had to smell the restroom.)

2280
01:21:52,164 --> 01:21:54,090
(So Min doesn't have a way out...)

2281
01:21:54,099 --> 01:21:56,930
(because of Ha Na's thoroughness to check the back of the restroom.)

2282
01:21:56,935 --> 01:22:00,430
(So Min, Captain of Team Face, is out.)

2283
01:22:00,438 --> 01:22:02,495
- Come on. - I got her.

2284
01:22:02,574 --> 01:22:03,940
There's no need. It's over.

2285
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:05,810
(He's in despair.)

2286
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:08,210
Gosh, how did you find me?

2287
01:22:08,213 --> 01:22:09,380
How did you find me?

2288
01:22:09,381 --> 01:22:11,380
(Legendary Treasure Hunt, their last mission, is over.)

2289
01:22:11,383 --> 01:22:13,350
Your final mission is over.

2290
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,980
During the race, some of you...

2291
01:22:14,986 --> 01:22:16,320
- Did they find it? - found the treasures.

2292
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:17,975
Really?

2293
01:22:18,323 --> 01:22:20,550
All right, first. Team Voice's captain...

2294
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:23,220
will divide the total amount of cash prize first.

2295
01:22:23,228 --> 01:22:25,945
Goodness, the captains have all the power today.

2296
01:22:26,932 --> 01:22:29,800
(How much money will Captain Haha give to his members?)

2297
01:22:29,801 --> 01:22:32,900
I'm sure it must be hard for the captains too.

2298
01:22:32,904 --> 01:22:37,495
(It must not be easy to divide the money among the members.)

2299
01:22:37,509 --> 01:22:40,170
All right. Okay. Thank you.

2300
01:22:40,178 --> 01:22:41,340
Thank you.

2301
01:22:41,346 --> 01:22:42,380
So Min.

2302
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,980
- So Min. - Ms. Jeon.

2303
01:22:43,982 --> 01:22:45,210
- You have a big responsibility. - So Min.

2304
01:22:45,217 --> 01:22:47,405
Should I lift you?

2305
01:22:47,719 --> 01:22:49,150
- Ms. Jeon. - So Min.

2306
01:22:49,154 --> 01:22:52,120
Just remember my last voice when I was telling you to run.

2307
01:22:52,123 --> 01:22:55,220
I've never made such a difficult decision.

2308
01:22:55,227 --> 01:22:57,775
Soo Hyang was the only one who didn't do anything. Remember.

2309
01:22:58,129 --> 01:22:59,230
(You know how I feel about you, right?)

2310
01:22:59,231 --> 01:23:00,530
What are you doing?

2311
01:23:00,532 --> 01:23:03,430
- Is this the total amount of money? - This is the total amount of money.

2312
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:06,630
(Will she distribute the money to Jae Seok and Seok Jin as promised?)

2313
01:23:06,638 --> 01:23:09,740
Can I make a transfer? Can I make a transfer from my account?

2314
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:11,895
- A transfer? - Yes. To someone else.

2315
01:23:12,811 --> 01:23:15,680
Here's the result of the race, Legendary Captain.

2316
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,910
(The total amount of cash prize for Team Face is...)

2317
01:23:16,915 --> 01:23:20,010
As for Team Face's cash prize,

2318
01:23:20,018 --> 01:23:21,580
they have 1,200 dollars in total.

2319
01:23:21,586 --> 01:23:22,935
(The final cash prize is 1,200 dollars.)

2320
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:24,420
(That's lower than I expected.)

2321
01:23:24,422 --> 01:23:27,520
- It's because of the loan. - Is that so?

2322
01:23:27,525 --> 01:23:30,475
As for Team Voice's cash prize...

2323
01:23:31,263 --> 01:23:32,790
(Please...)

2324
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:33,790
I found it.

2325
01:23:33,798 --> 01:23:35,760
(During the final mission, with an elaborate plan,)

2326
01:23:35,767 --> 01:23:39,785
(they didn't lose the hope of winning the race.)

2327
01:23:40,272 --> 01:23:42,940
(Let's beat them! Races with twists are the most fun.)

2328
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:44,240
As for Team Voice's...

2329
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:45,640
(Considering the money we found,)

2330
01:23:45,644 --> 01:23:49,335
(it's enough to turn the tables around for this race.)

2331
01:23:49,848 --> 01:23:51,210
(The total amount of cash prize for Team Voice is...)

2332
01:23:51,216 --> 01:23:52,780
It's 890 dollars. It's Team Face's win.

2333
01:23:52,784 --> 01:23:54,210
- Okay. - Okay.

2334
01:23:54,219 --> 01:23:56,220
- I can't believe it. We won. - Our team won.

2335
01:23:56,221 --> 01:23:57,720
- I didn't even imagine we'd win. - This is amazing.

2336
01:23:57,722 --> 01:23:59,345
I thought we would...

2337
01:23:59,391 --> 01:24:00,420
So Min, you should've picked me.

2338
01:24:00,425 --> 01:24:02,420
- I thought we had a shot. - Right.

2339
01:24:02,427 --> 01:24:03,560
So Min, I thought that too.

2340
01:24:03,561 --> 01:24:05,730
- Team Face won the race. - Okay.

2341
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:07,960
- We'll give you a meaningful gift. - You'll give us a present?

2342
01:24:07,966 --> 01:24:09,800
Since it's autumn when reading is most fun,

2343
01:24:09,801 --> 01:24:12,300
we'll give you 5 classic books. You can each read 1 book.

2344
01:24:12,304 --> 01:24:13,930
- You'll give books? - That's great.

2345
01:24:13,938 --> 01:24:15,140
I'm so jealous.

2346
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,140
(Fill the heart of your knowledge.)

2347
01:24:16,141 --> 01:24:17,500
- Seriously. - Thank you.

2348
01:24:17,509 --> 01:24:19,940
- Hold on. Among these five books, - You're smiling too much.

2349
01:24:19,944 --> 01:24:22,510
- I want Seok Jin to have this book. - Okay.

2350
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:24,735
(A book for me?)

2351
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:26,150
"The Last Leaf".

2352
01:24:26,151 --> 01:24:28,775
("The Last Leaf" suits Seok Jin perfectly.)

2353
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,580
Seok Jin, please don't fall.

2354
01:24:31,589 --> 01:24:33,345
(Seok Jin is hanging by a thread.)

2355
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,890
- He's barely hanging there. - "Hanging there"?

2356
01:24:35,894 --> 01:24:38,220
Hey, this one is "Crime and Punishment".

2357
01:24:38,229 --> 01:24:39,730
You'll read the first part.

2358
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:42,260
- Isn't that So Min? - You'll read the second part.

2359
01:24:42,267 --> 01:24:44,260
1st and 2nd books of "Crime and Punishment".

2360
01:24:44,269 --> 01:24:47,330
- "My Sweet Orange Tree" is yours. - It suits her.

2361
01:24:47,339 --> 01:24:50,170
I'll take "The Great Gatsby". He'll take "The Old Man and the Sea".

2362
01:24:50,175 --> 01:24:52,625
(The oldest member will take one more book.)

2363
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:55,680
("The Last Leaf and the Sea")

2364
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,580
- It worked out perfectly. - I'll give one to Ha Na.

2365
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:00,750
I can't let go of "The Old Man and the Sea".

2366
01:25:00,752 --> 01:25:02,105
(This is mine.)

2367
01:25:02,387 --> 01:25:04,050
I'll take this. You take "The Last Leaf".

2368
01:25:04,055 --> 01:25:06,420
- Really? Thank you. - Yes.

2369
01:25:06,424 --> 01:25:08,920
- Seriously. - From the winning team,

2370
01:25:08,927 --> 01:25:11,360
- One of us will face it. - the one with the least money is...

2371
01:25:11,363 --> 01:25:12,745
Let's do this.

2372
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:14,430
You should have picked me.

2373
01:25:14,432 --> 01:25:16,600
- It's not you. How could I do that? - Exactly. You should've done that.

2374
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:18,260
I would have been fine with the penalty.

2375
01:25:18,269 --> 01:25:21,740
Me too. I would've been okay. I haven't been here in a while.

2376
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,440
If anyone has to face it, I'd feel better if it was me.

2377
01:25:24,442 --> 01:25:26,010
- My heart is beating fast. - Soo Hyang should get it.

2378
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,195
- Let her face it. - The one with the most money is...

2379
01:25:28,847 --> 01:25:30,810
- So Min. She has 1,590 dollars. - That's right.

2380
01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:32,165
(Captain So Min has 1,590 dollars.)

2381
01:25:32,517 --> 01:25:34,410
- What? - She has 1,590 dollars?

2382
01:25:34,419 --> 01:25:36,735
(The cash prize is 1,200 dollars. And she has 1,590 dollars?)

2383
01:25:36,855 --> 01:25:39,190
- No, this wasn't planned. - I don't believe this.

2384
01:25:39,190 --> 01:25:41,790
(They can't believe their ears. Did we hear that right?)

2385
01:25:41,793 --> 01:25:43,920
- No, this wasn't planned. - 1,590 dollars?

2386
01:25:43,928 --> 01:25:45,760
- Hold on, what's going on? - Then the rest of the money...

2387
01:25:45,764 --> 01:25:47,790
- is the loan. - All of them are placed last.

2388
01:25:47,799 --> 01:25:50,160
- That's not it. No, it's not. - Is everyone placed last?

2389
01:25:50,168 --> 01:25:52,100
- That's not true at all. - Do we owe money?

2390
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:54,085
- No. - The second place goes to...

2391
01:25:54,239 --> 01:25:56,170
Soo Hyang with 300 dollars.

2392
01:25:56,174 --> 01:25:58,640
- You gave me 300 dollars? - That's a lot.

2393
01:25:58,643 --> 01:26:00,710
(Thank goodness. I dodged the last place.)

2394
01:26:00,712 --> 01:26:02,510
- The third place goes to... - It depends on the contribution.

2395
01:26:02,514 --> 01:26:04,510
- Kwang Soo with 110 dollars. - Okay!

2396
01:26:04,516 --> 01:26:05,680
He's in third?

2397
01:26:05,683 --> 01:26:07,710
(Smelling the toilets with her paid off!)

2398
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:09,380
What is this? Then it's Seok Jin or Jae Seok.

2399
01:26:09,387 --> 01:26:10,750
(One of them is placed last.)

2400
01:26:10,755 --> 01:26:13,020
- Hey, you. Are you serious? - My gosh.

2401
01:26:13,024 --> 01:26:14,575
- It's not me, right? - Seok Jin.

2402
01:26:14,592 --> 01:26:16,760
- Okay, okay. - Jae Seok.

2403
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:18,730
- This is what's important. - Fine, I got it.

2404
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:21,130
- I thought... - I know myself.

2405
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:22,730
- All right. Let's go. - You have 1,590 dollars.

2406
01:26:22,734 --> 01:26:23,900
(Please let me not be placed last.)

2407
01:26:23,902 --> 01:26:26,470
- The fourth place... - Okay.

2408
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:28,330
(The one in 4th place will dodge the penalty.)

2409
01:26:28,339 --> 01:26:30,270
- Who's in 4th? - He has 50 dollars.

2410
01:26:30,275 --> 01:26:31,300
- 50 dollars. - 50 dollars. That's great.

2411
01:26:31,309 --> 01:26:33,010
- Fourth place will be safe. - I'd be grateful.

2412
01:26:33,011 --> 01:26:34,270
That's good enough.

2413
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:36,480
(Which one will be placed 4th?)

2414
01:26:36,481 --> 01:26:37,510
- Jee Seok Jin. - Yes!

2415
01:26:37,515 --> 01:26:39,635
(I'm not placed last!)

2416
01:26:39,684 --> 01:26:41,820
(By default, Jae Seok will face the penalty.)

2417
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,520
- Jae Seok owes 850 dollars. - Yes!

2418
01:26:44,522 --> 01:26:46,245
You got this all wrong.

2419
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:48,590
(I'm already upset to face the penalty after winning.)

2420
01:26:48,593 --> 01:26:51,260
- No, listen. Hear me out. - You owe them money.

2421
01:26:51,262 --> 01:26:53,030
- Hey. - It just happened during the race.

2422
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:55,145
I don't think it could just happen.

2423
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,560
Jae Seok didn't contribute to our victory at all.

2424
01:26:57,569 --> 01:26:59,730
- That's not true. - You have 1,590 dollars.

2425
01:26:59,737 --> 01:27:02,640
- It's Team Voice's turn. - I'm a great captain.

2426
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,810
For Team Voice, only the member in first place will not face it.

2427
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:07,240
We'll start from the bottom.

2428
01:27:07,245 --> 01:27:10,980
Se Chan is placed last and owes 20 dollars.

2429
01:27:10,982 --> 01:27:12,410
- I owe money? - He owes money?

2430
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:14,880
- He only owes 20 dollars. - Hey.

2431
01:27:14,886 --> 01:27:18,075
The losing team owes only 20 dollars.

2432
01:27:18,223 --> 01:27:20,750
- How could you be so heartless? - My gosh.

2433
01:27:20,758 --> 01:27:23,215
And I'll announce the fourth place.

2434
01:27:23,428 --> 01:27:25,290
It's Haha with 10 dollars.

2435
01:27:25,296 --> 01:27:26,530
(Haha has 10 dollars.)

2436
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:27,730
(He's the captain, but he's in 4th place?)

2437
01:27:27,732 --> 01:27:29,315
- He placed himself fourth. - My gosh.

2438
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:31,760
- I knew he'd do this. Goodness. - My gosh.

2439
01:27:31,769 --> 01:27:33,130
- And... - I had no expectations.

2440
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:35,800
Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Ha Na are...

2441
01:27:35,807 --> 01:27:37,440
- placed 1st with 300 dollars. - My goodness.

2442
01:27:37,442 --> 01:27:39,225
(Jong Kook, Ji Hyo, and Ha Na are placed 1st altogether.)

2443
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,340
- Seriously? - What will happen to us?

2444
01:27:40,345 --> 01:27:42,680
- The three of you are exempted. - Really?

2445
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:43,680
(They won't face the penalty.)

2446
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:45,180
(This is Haha's leadership skill.)

2447
01:27:45,183 --> 01:27:46,380
- Haha, why? - Is this even allowed?

2448
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:48,180
- This can't be allowed. - This isn't fair.

2449
01:27:48,186 --> 01:27:49,820
- Seriously? - This isn't fair.

2450
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,320
- I knew you'd be great. - Haha, what about me?

2451
01:27:52,323 --> 01:27:54,050
What about me? Answer me.

2452
01:27:54,058 --> 01:27:57,290
- Listen. Stop acting cool. - What was that? What are you doing?

2453
01:27:57,295 --> 01:28:00,090
What about me? Come on, this isn't fair. You can't do that.

2454
01:28:00,098 --> 01:28:01,900
- He can't do this. - What is this?

2455
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,760
- Hey, what did you do? - Listen.

2456
01:28:03,768 --> 01:28:06,300
You should have placed all of us in first place.

2457
01:28:06,304 --> 01:28:08,430
If we were all in first place, no one would've been in last.

2458
01:28:08,439 --> 01:28:09,500
I should have placed some of you in last.

2459
01:28:09,507 --> 01:28:11,300
- You're going to face the penalty? - This doesn't make sense.

2460
01:28:11,309 --> 01:28:12,340
I should have done that.

2461
01:28:12,343 --> 01:28:14,270
(3 members are chosen to face the penalty.)

2462
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:17,210
All right. Three of you will face the penalty,

2463
01:28:17,215 --> 01:28:19,580
but we only prepared two cannons.

2464
01:28:19,584 --> 01:28:21,510
- Among the 3 of you... - I owe 10 dollars.

2465
01:28:21,519 --> 01:28:23,675
He owes 20 dollars, and Jae Seok, 850 dollars.

2466
01:28:23,888 --> 01:28:25,590
- Race of Wits. 1. - 2.

2467
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:27,075
(They're suddenly playing the Game of Wits.)

2468
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:32,485
(He hasn't grasped the situation. He's in a daze.)

2469
01:28:33,765 --> 01:28:35,260
Hold on. Wait.

2470
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,830
(You love the game, but the game will end you.)

2471
01:28:36,834 --> 01:28:38,130
- That was amazing. - Hold on a second.

2472
01:28:38,136 --> 01:28:39,670
- You love the Race of Wits. - We have to say, "start".

2473
01:28:39,671 --> 01:28:41,730
- No, you love this game. - We have to say, "start".

2474
01:28:41,739 --> 01:28:42,870
Please go sit over there.

2475
01:28:42,874 --> 01:28:44,740
- Why would I do that? - Go sit there. You love this game.

2476
01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:46,740
- Go sit, Jae Seok. - You lost the game. Go sit, please.

2477
01:28:46,744 --> 01:28:48,510
- We didn't start yet. - Sit over there.

2478
01:28:48,513 --> 01:28:51,340
- Please go sit over there. - You love that game. Come on, sit.

2479
01:28:51,349 --> 01:28:53,380
(Jae Seok who's slow-witted will face the penalty.)

2480
01:28:53,384 --> 01:28:55,350
I can't believe this.

2481
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:58,180
All right. You two must decide between yourselves.

2482
01:28:58,189 --> 01:29:00,420
Why don't I choose one of them?

2483
01:29:00,425 --> 01:29:01,905
(How about I choose?)

2484
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,260
(Darn it.)

2485
01:29:03,261 --> 01:29:04,975
- That's a great idea. - This is good, right?

2486
01:29:05,296 --> 01:29:08,130
All right then. Jae Seok will choose someone.

2487
01:29:08,132 --> 01:29:10,285
(Hello, quick-witted friends.)

2488
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:12,570
- "Infinite Challenge". - Haha.

2489
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:14,000
(He's quick on his feet.)

2490
01:29:14,005 --> 01:29:15,940
- "Infinite Challenge". - Haha, you can't do that.

2491
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:17,325
What are you doing?

2492
01:29:17,475 --> 01:29:18,740
(Think about our old days together.)

2493
01:29:18,743 --> 01:29:20,740
Let's smile even if it hurts.

2494
01:29:20,745 --> 01:29:22,265
It hurts.

2495
01:29:23,014 --> 01:29:24,210
It hurts.

2496
01:29:24,215 --> 01:29:25,710
(I know how you feel, Haha.)

2497
01:29:25,717 --> 01:29:27,410
(Our friendship is very special, isn't it?)

2498
01:29:27,418 --> 01:29:28,980
- You should face the penalty. - Okay!

2499
01:29:28,987 --> 01:29:31,235
(That's why you should face the penalty.)

2500
01:29:32,223 --> 01:29:34,645
(Yes! I'm exempted. I'm saved!)

2501
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:37,060
"Infinite Challenge".

2502
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:38,730
- "Infinite Challenge". - "Infinite Challenge".

2503
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,090
(Let's continue our friendship all the way to the cannons.)

2504
01:29:40,098 --> 01:29:41,130
Okay!

2505
01:29:41,132 --> 01:29:42,685
(Our friendship is indeed infinite.)

2506
01:29:42,767 --> 01:29:44,415
Say a few words beforehand.

2507
01:29:44,736 --> 01:29:47,470
Everyone, I had so much fun today.

2508
01:29:47,472 --> 01:29:49,740
(These two original captains put on the best performances today.)

2509
01:29:49,741 --> 01:29:53,310
Thanks to the members of Running Man,

2510
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:55,840
I had such a great time today.

2511
01:29:55,847 --> 01:29:57,810
- All right. - The 2 of you should count to 3.

2512
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:00,065
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

2513
01:30:00,518 --> 01:30:02,005
- In 2, 3 - In 2, 3.

2514
01:30:03,154 --> 01:30:04,380
(It hits their faces perfectly.)

2515
01:30:04,389 --> 01:30:05,775
That was great.

2516
01:30:06,557 --> 01:30:09,575
(The Legendary Captain Race ends.)

2517
01:30:09,794 --> 01:30:11,615
(Next week)

2518
01:30:11,663 --> 01:30:13,060
Sit down.

2519
01:30:13,064 --> 01:30:14,960
(They disregard the age.)

2520
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:17,185
Gosh, you ugly jerk!

2521
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:19,185
(Mockery is an everyday occurrence.)

2522
01:30:19,237 --> 01:30:21,330
(There is no rank in Running Man.)

2523
01:30:21,339 --> 01:30:23,125
Why would you hit a senior member?

2524
01:30:24,342 --> 01:30:25,870
(It's time to form a new rank.)

2525
01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:27,840
(That's how the war of the rank begins.)

2526
01:30:27,845 --> 01:30:30,865
(They let go of their images to go up the rank.)

2527
01:30:31,282 --> 01:30:34,910
(They struggle to bring changes to the show.)

2528
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:37,250
(If you win the war,)

2529
01:30:37,255 --> 01:30:40,620
(can you rule the show?)

2530
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:43,075
(However,)

2531
01:30:43,494 --> 01:30:45,560
(someone is changing the show.)

2532
01:30:45,563 --> 01:30:49,260
(The secret of the war of the rank get revealed.)

2533
01:30:49,267 --> 01:30:52,115
(What's the secret that shocks everyone?)

2534
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:54,825
(Game of Thrones)
