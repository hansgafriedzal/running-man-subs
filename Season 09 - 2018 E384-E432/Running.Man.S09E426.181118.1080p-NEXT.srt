1
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,780
Gosh, it smells like gingko nuts.

2
00:00:07,787 --> 00:00:09,780
(You can feel the end of fall approaching this morning in Seoul.)

3
00:00:09,789 --> 00:00:12,055
- Hello. - Hello.

4
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:15,560
(Hello, good morning.)

5
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:18,390
(Why is Jae Seok alone?)

6
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,060
You are making me nervous. Why are we starting off separately?

7
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,400
(Why are we starting off separately?)

8
00:00:22,402 --> 00:00:23,800
What is going on?

9
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:25,970
Why did you ask me to come to the beauty shop?

10
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:26,970
Hello.

11
00:00:26,973 --> 00:00:29,535
(Each member has an opening alone.)

12
00:00:29,776 --> 00:00:31,475
Hello.

13
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,375
Good morning.

14
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:35,610
This is a mission for you.

15
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:40,345
Why didn't you wait for me to say hello to the viewers?

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,150
Hello, viewers. Good morning.

17
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:45,720
Please move back a little.

18
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:48,195
Should I move back a little? Okay.

19
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:51,090
This is the first mission.

20
00:00:51,097 --> 00:00:52,490
The first mission?

21
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:53,600
(It's out of the blue.)

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,770
(What's the first mission everyone got at the same time?)

23
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,330
What is this?

24
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:01,800
"Which member knows the most about the Running Man members?"

25
00:01:01,808 --> 00:01:03,670
(Which member knows the most about the Running Man members?)

26
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:07,880
"Which member knows the most about the Running Man members?"

27
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:11,245
"Everyone must give the same answer in order to succeed."

28
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,980
One member who knows us the most.

29
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,350
Yes.

30
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:18,555
We have worked together...

31
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,620
for over eight years.

32
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:23,055
We know each other pretty well.

33
00:01:23,496 --> 00:01:26,700
(Spending 8 years together,)

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,965
(the members came to know each other like a family.)

35
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:35,135
(Is there one person who knows the others the most?)

36
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:38,945
(Can they give a unanimous answer?)

37
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:42,580
I personally think...

38
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:46,185
I know a lot about the members.

39
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:48,250
However, it's a secret.

40
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,520
The fact I know a lot about the members...

41
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:54,420
is a well-kept secret.

42
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:57,390
Actually, I know too much.

43
00:01:57,397 --> 00:01:59,490
As for Jong Kook,

44
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:02,400
I know every girl he has dated.

45
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:04,170
Oh, it's a secret.

46
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,865
Can you edit this part out?

47
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:08,400
He dated a celebrity. Please edit this out.

48
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,070
Recently, Se Chan has seen someone.

49
00:02:11,077 --> 00:02:13,070
Please edit this out.

50
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:16,415
As for So Min, she goes around talking about her private life.

51
00:02:16,616 --> 00:02:18,510
(Haha is the king of editing.)

52
00:02:18,518 --> 00:02:21,080
I know so much. In any case...

53
00:02:21,087 --> 00:02:23,315
(Who is Haha's choice?)

54
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:25,790
My choice is Jae Seok.

55
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,120
Jae Seok has been on the show...

56
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,160
the longest.

57
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:34,600
He is close to all the members.

58
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,200
He has known Seok Jin...

59
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:40,240
for over 30 years.

60
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,140
They were friends since their days of obscurity.

61
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:46,240
He and I have been in two major programs.

62
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:48,510
Because of that,

63
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:50,880
we spent a lot of time together.

64
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,680
He has also worked with Jong Kook since "Family Outing"...

65
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:55,220
and "X-Man".

66
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:57,190
For many years,

67
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,690
he has been a diligent leader.

68
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:02,055
That's why I think it's Jae Seok.

69
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:03,730
It has to be Jae Seok.

70
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,690
Who else would it be?

71
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:08,860
The member who knows the least is Seok Jin for sure.

72
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:11,030
I would be confident with my answer if that's the question.

73
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:13,970
Seok Jin knows nothing about us.

74
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:17,870
Seok Jin is only interested in himself.

75
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:20,810
Jae Seok knows not only the Running Man members,

76
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:24,810
but also everyone. I heard he has more than 10 TVs.

77
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:27,320
That's how he watches so many programs.

78
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,120
He knows everything.

79
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,420
- Yu Jae Seok. - Yu Jae Seok.

80
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,520
My answer is Jae Seok.

81
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,185
(7 members beside Jae Seok chose Jae Seok.)

82
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,690
(Meanwhile, Jae Seok receives the question.)

83
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:37,495
What is this?

84
00:03:37,997 --> 00:03:40,130
"Everyone must give the same answer in order to succeed."

85
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,230
(Which member will Jae Seok choose?)

86
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,030
(Their answers will be unanimous...)

87
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,170
I know.

88
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,635
(if Jae Seok picks himself.)

89
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:48,200
Yu Jae Seok.

90
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,240
(He picks himself without hesitation.)

91
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:54,445
(Everyone picks Yu Jae Seok.)

92
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,210
All eight members have picked...

93
00:03:57,217 --> 00:03:59,150
- Yu Jae Seok. - Really?

94
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:02,320
- The first mission is a success. - Okay. Come on.

95
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,250
That was easy.

96
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:06,990
I know them the best.

97
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,820
All eight members chose Yu Jae Seok.

98
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:10,930
- The first mission is... - Really?

99
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,060
a success.

100
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,860
- Did everyone choose Jae Seok? - Yes.

101
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,435
Did no one choose me?

102
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,800
I am glad we succeeded, but...

103
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,300
- I didn't get a single vote? - No.

104
00:04:20,306 --> 00:04:23,675
I know a lot about them.

105
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,410
What are we doing today?

106
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:27,275
What are the rules?

107
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:28,980
What are we doing today?

108
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:33,180
We will have How Well Do You Know Running Man Race.

109
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:34,520
(How Well Do You Know Running Man Race)

110
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,050
Jae Seok, you were chosen by all eight members.

111
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,320
Among the eight missions the production crew prepared,

112
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:42,220
pick one mission and go to the member...

113
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,290
who would be the best at it.

114
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:48,030
If the member completes the mission, you receive one success.

115
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:51,230
If all seven members succeed, you can go home right away.

116
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,270
(It's an incredible offer.)

117
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:56,605
If all seven members succeed, you can go home right away.

118
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,970
If anyone fails, all members...

119
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,610
will be dragged away and locked in the final location.

120
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:05,710
My goodness. My goodness.

121
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:07,555
(Dragged away and locked?)

122
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:11,720
(The final location has the members' name tags.)

123
00:05:11,724 --> 00:05:14,790
(When a member succeeds a mission, his or her name tag lights up.)

124
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:17,790
(If they fail to light up all the name tags,)

125
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,660
(they must succeed the final mission and escape in a set time.)

126
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:23,970
(A big penalty awaits should they fail.)

127
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,435
If I fail, everyone will be dragged away?

128
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:28,935
I hope I am last.

129
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,610
I don't do well under pressure.

130
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,210
I don't want to participate in a mission today.

131
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:35,545
I don't want to be pressured.

132
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:38,880
You might think it's easy, but it's hard.

133
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:40,350
We succeeded one mission, right?

134
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:41,420
Yes, you did.

135
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:43,180
- Do I pick a mission? - Yes.

136
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,620
(It's time for Jae Seok to pick the second mission.)

137
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:46,550
Gosh, this is...

138
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:51,865
(Their success depends on how well Jae Seok distributes the missions.)

139
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:53,525
This one.

140
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:58,935
(What is the second mission?)

141
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:00,765
Ddakji Game.

142
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:05,605
(Flip over a ddakji at once to succeed.)

143
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:08,140
"Flip over a ddakji at once to succeed." This is my mission.

144
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:10,040
(He is really disappointed.)

145
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:13,615
This is my mission.

146
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,780
Gosh.

147
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:16,715
(This is a mission for Jae Seok, the king of ddakjis.)

148
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:20,360
I would be the best for this mission.

149
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,625
This is really disappointing.

150
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:26,925
Who can flip over a ddakji at once?

151
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,600
(Let's see who is good at it.)

152
00:06:29,602 --> 00:06:31,235
Me.

153
00:06:31,404 --> 00:06:33,200
(No matter how hard I think, it's me.)

154
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,140
I am the best.

155
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,170
(He is proud.)

156
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:40,040
I am the best. Everyone else is the same.

157
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:42,140
The person who can flip over a ddakji at once...

158
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:44,110
is either Jong Kook or Seok Jin.

159
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,080
(Jong Kook or Seok Jin)

160
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,150
We are two thirds there.

161
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:49,120
(Ddakji Game is all about strength.)

162
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:53,685
(Will it be the powerful Jong Kook?)

163
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:58,030
(He only had ddakji when he was young.)

164
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:02,665
(Will it be the veteran, Seok Jin?)

165
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:06,100
(Who will be chosen as a player for Ddakji Game?)

166
00:07:06,105 --> 00:07:07,400
(Thinking)

167
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:10,440
I will pick Seok Jin.

168
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,210
Seok Jin's place is close from here.

169
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,080
Seok Jin has often played Ddakji Game.

170
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
In terms of experience, he is the best candidate.

171
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,250
He has played it for a long time.

172
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,080
- Shall we go? - Let's go right away.

173
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,620
(The second player is Seok Jin.)

174
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's go.

175
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:27,160
(Seok Jin's place in Jamwon-dong.)

176
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,120
A mission like this one is pretty doable.

177
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,960
It's not too hard.

178
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,430
(It looks like we will succeed today.)

179
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:38,765
(If Seok Jin does as well as he did back then...)

180
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:42,805
(Seok Jin, please succeed.)

181
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:44,940
Heading to Seok Jin now.

182
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:49,140
(Was it the right call to choose Seok Jin?)

183
00:07:49,148 --> 00:07:50,450
(He arrives at where Seok Jin is now.)

184
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,285
I'm getting off now.

185
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:57,055
(Where is Seok Jin, the ddakji player?)

186
00:07:57,123 --> 00:07:58,220
Where is he?

187
00:07:58,224 --> 00:07:59,590
(There's no Seok Jin. No one is there.)

188
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:01,590
He went to the restroom all of a sudden.

189
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:02,690
What did you say?

190
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:03,960
(Dumbfounded)

191
00:08:03,963 --> 00:08:06,265
Why would he go to the restroom now? We're filming.

192
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,735
(Seok Jin was waiting for Jae Seok to make a decision.)

193
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,470
Today's weather is kind of cold.

194
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:15,205
(It's chilly, but Jae Seok isn't there.)

195
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,800
- I'm going to use the restroom. - Okay.

196
00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:19,540
(Seok Jin left his spot to empty out some things.)

197
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:21,580
Why would he go to the restroom now? We're filming.

198
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,950
- Seok Jin, have you lost your mind? - What?

199
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,150
Are you here to work or not?

200
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,080
I wanted to use the restroom before you came.

201
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:32,020
You killed all the suspense. How can you go to the restroom now?

202
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:34,090
Why did you come when I went to the restroom out of all times?

203
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:35,660
- I've been waiting for you. - Listen.

204
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,390
- You know? - You killed the mood. Why go there?

205
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:40,060
(Something is off even from the first player.)

206
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,700
- I didn't kill the suspense. - I mean...

207
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:42,960
There's tension in the air.

208
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:45,570
- Always be ready for the tension. - Hey, even if...

209
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,700
- All right. - Okay.

210
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,200
For a part of today's mission,

211
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:50,270
the mission you'll try out is...

212
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,340
the Ddakji Game.

213
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:54,205
Gosh, I'm the best at it. My second name is Jee Ddakji.

214
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,740
- What did you say? - It's Jee Ddakji.

215
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:56,740
"Jee Ddakji"?

216
00:08:56,749 --> 00:08:58,050
- No, it's more like Jee Booger. - Hey.

217
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,810
- Hey, no. I'm good at that. - You have a booger there.

218
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,220
The clip that I won the Ddakji Game is playing at the corner.

219
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:04,720
- I won the game. It's playing. - Where is that clip?

220
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,120
- What are you talking about? - It's playing at this corner. Here.

221
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,990
- They dug out a corner for me. - Where in the corner?

222
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,690
They dug it out and are showing the time when I won.

223
00:09:10,696 --> 00:09:12,190
- What are you talking about? - I remember that.

224
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,260
(Don't you remember? Me, the King of Ddakji, Jee Ddakji)

225
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,500
(Please do well just like that day.)

226
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:19,370
Okay. You must flip this ddakji with this one.

227
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,900
You have to flip it at once.

228
00:09:21,908 --> 00:09:23,400
If you don't, it's over.

229
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:25,370
(If he fails, everyone will head to the final destination.)

230
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:31,385
(All right. Let me warm up.)

231
00:09:32,051 --> 00:09:33,450
(Struggling)

232
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:35,155
Pull this out.

233
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,250
You only get 1 chance. Only 1 chance.

234
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,550
- What if I fail? - What do you think?

235
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:40,320
- If you fail, it's over. - It's over then.

236
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,420
- You'll be locked up right away. - Really?

237
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,790
We have to complete the mission to get off work.

238
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:44,790
Only if we complete the mission?

239
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,060
(He can do this, right?)

240
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:48,200
Can't I have a practice round? Can I practice?

241
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll let you practice.

242
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:50,730
(He can practice before he tries.)

243
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:53,570
(My instinct that he'd be good was correct, right?)

244
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:55,070
There's no re-do. You only get one chance.

245
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,300
- I can do it here. - Go.

246
00:09:56,309 --> 00:09:57,370
Hit the center of it.

247
00:09:57,376 --> 00:09:59,310
- Your vision is important. - Great.

248
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:01,910
- Look at the center. - I'll spot it until the end.

249
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:03,310
Look right in the center.

250
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:04,510
- Will you try now? - You only get one chance.

251
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:05,680
Start.

252
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:07,820
(He'll try right away.)

253
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,680
- Quiet. - If you fail, it's over.

254
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,820
This is really important.

255
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:12,850
(Let me get back my skill as the King of Ddakji.)

256
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:17,060
(He only gets one chance. He must succeed by all means.)

257
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:21,700
(If he fails, everyone will be dragged to the final destination.)

258
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,630
Make sure you hit the center.

259
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,000
Hit it hard.

260
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:26,030
Please.

261
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:29,075
(I can overcome this pressure.)

262
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:36,475
(Will Seok Jin be able to flip the ddakji?)

263
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,680
- Okay! - Okay!

264
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:38,880
(It's flipped!)

265
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,720
(I'm Jee Ddakji.)

266
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:43,355
We did it.

267
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:45,820
Did you see that? It turned twice.

268
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,860
- We did it. - That's how powerful I am.

269
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,160
- My goodness. - Didn't I tell you? I'm Jee Ddakji.

270
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:52,395
- All right. You... - Goodness.

271
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:54,165
- completed the mission. - Yes!

272
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:56,300
- I picked the right person. - We're having a great start.

273
00:10:56,302 --> 00:10:57,430
Gosh, this was great.

274
00:10:57,436 --> 00:11:00,330
- Seok Jin completed the mission. - This isn't easy, you know.

275
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:04,140
(As Seok Jin accomplishes his mission,)

276
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:07,075
(his name tag is lit up.)

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,910
Here's the next mission.

278
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,680
(They completed 2 missions so far. It's time for their 3rd one.)

279
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:16,655
(Since the beginning is important, he must choose a good one.)

280
00:11:17,156 --> 00:11:19,155
Choose the opposite of what you want first.

281
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,955
Shouldn't we go with that one?

282
00:11:22,161 --> 00:11:23,260
- What's that? - Hey.

283
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,530
(What's the third mission Jae Seok chose?)

284
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,195
"Witty Pictionary".

285
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,360
It's Witty Pictionary.

286
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,670
(Figure out the answer with a picture.)

287
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,200
Hold on. If that's the mission...

288
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:34,440
(Who's good at clever jokes?)

289
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,535
From a picture? If it's witty,

290
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,975
Haha is good at it.

291
00:11:39,378 --> 00:11:41,640
(A lion falls into the soup. What's the name of it?)

292
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,380
(The answer is animal kingdom.)

293
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:47,985
(Will they go to Haha who's good at figuring out clever puns?)

294
00:11:48,554 --> 00:11:50,550
- Or Kwang Soo? - Should we go to Kwang Soo?

295
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:54,025
- He's better than you'd expect. - He's pretty good.

296
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,290
(Kwang Soo enjoys drawing which will be an advantage.)

297
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,730
(Besides, his pictures are already like clever jokes.)

298
00:11:59,732 --> 00:12:05,505
(Which one will Jae Seok choose? Kwang Soo or Haha?)

299
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:07,800
Kwang Soo.

300
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,800
- We'll get going now. - Kwang Soo.

301
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:10,835
- Where is he? Let's go. - Kwang Soo.

302
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:12,270
Let's go.

303
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:15,510
- Okay, let's go. - Okay. Let's go.

304
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,780
I'm good at figuring out those puns.

305
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:19,050
- You are? - Yes.

306
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:20,920
- No, you're not. - I'm good at it.

307
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,950
You're terrible at it.

308
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,350
- Let me give you a problem. - Gosh, bring it.

309
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:27,525
- I got this from the internet. - I'll get it right for certain.

310
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,790
Lately, I've been on the streets, giving people quizzes.

311
00:12:30,796 --> 00:12:32,360
Just tell me. I'll get them all right.

312
00:12:32,365 --> 00:12:33,530
(Wait for it. I'll get you a hard one.)

313
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,060
"What does it make when a bear stands on his head?"

314
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,800
- When a bear stands on his head? - Yes.

315
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:38,230
It's a door.

316
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,570
(He answers it correctly right away.)

317
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:41,140
- How did you figure it out? - Goodness.

318
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,875
Gosh, that's easy.

319
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,070
You're frustrating.

320
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:48,915
"What does a king say when he doesn't want to go to a palace?"

321
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:50,950
He mutters.

322
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,380
How did you figure it out? That was correct.

323
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,820
- That's a piece of cake. - You know that one.

324
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,590
Of course. I'm clever, you know.

325
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,290
(Hopefully, Kwang Soo can be as clever as Jae Seok.)

326
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,160
- Goodness, he must be here. - We're here.

327
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,895
Yes, we arrived.

328
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:04,960
- I think he's over there. - Where?

329
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,060
He's over there. He's in front of us.

330
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:08,095
(There's Kwang Soo, our player for Witty Pictionary.)

331
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:09,730
(My members are here.)

332
00:13:09,735 --> 00:13:10,770
They are here.

333
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,565
(Feeling happy to see them)

334
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,400
I see the R Sticker on the van.

335
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:17,505
(He rushes to them as he's grateful for their trust.)

336
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,170
I see the R Sticker on the van.

337
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:23,415
(They chose Kwang Soo for the third mission without any hesitation.)

338
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,380
Hello.

339
00:13:25,384 --> 00:13:26,750
What's going on? Jae Seok.

340
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:28,655
Goodness.

341
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,820
(As soon as he sees Kwang Soo, troubling thoughts flood in.)

342
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:33,090
(Gosh, I'm not sure if he can pull this off.)

343
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:34,720
- Hello. - Let's go to the park first.

344
00:13:34,727 --> 00:13:36,990
(With a heavy heart, they head to carry out the 3rd mission.)

345
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,990
- I flipped the ddakji at once. - This is a lot of pressure.

346
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:41,060
- It's for All-Success Mission. - Okay.

347
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,130
The mission Kwang Soo will try is...

348
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,030
Witty Pictionary.

349
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:47,130
Witty Pictionary?

350
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,070
- You have to... - With the given picture,

351
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:51,605
you must guess a term, associated to the photo.

352
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:54,140
- You only get 1 chance. - Just 1 chance.

353
00:13:54,146 --> 00:13:56,880
Other members cannot give you an answer.

354
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,710
I'll take this seriously. When it comes to this kind of...

355
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,010
You know, Kwang Soo...

356
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,420
might not be knowledgeable, but he is...

357
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,150
- pretty good at... - I'll take this seriously.

358
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:06,120
How could you say that right before my important moment?

359
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,060
- You should encourage me. - Kwang Soo is...

360
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,390
A friend of mine told me.

361
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:12,960
You were once placed last in your whole grade.

362
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,160
Who told you that?

363
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,935
- I wasn't last in my grade. - Is it not true?

364
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:19,400
- Is that true? - I wasn't last in my grade.

365
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:20,570
I was the third from the back.

366
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:21,670
(I was 3rd from the back.)

367
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,310
At that time, I was going through a rebellious stage.

368
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,870
As if that's true.

369
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:28,240
Who told you that?

370
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,510
I wasn't last in my grade.

371
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:31,610
- I'm serious. I swear I wasn't. - Two students were behind you.

372
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,780
- Two students were behind you. - Yes.

373
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,620
I'm very close with 1 of the 2 students.

374
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,080
- Really? - Yes.

375
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,050
- Are you serious? - Yes. It's like...

376
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,290
he used to be my cutthroat competition.

377
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:43,290
We have put everything behind us and are like family now.

378
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:44,560
Why are you laughing?

379
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:45,690
Don't think...

380
00:14:45,698 --> 00:14:48,330
only those in the higher places have a fierce competition going on.

381
00:14:48,334 --> 00:14:50,970
- We're competitive in our own way. - We're competitive in our own way.

382
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,100
- The competition is fierce too. - That's right.

383
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,870
- Right, right. - It hurts our pride if we lose.

384
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,340
It depends on which one sleeps an extra hour or not.

385
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,140
- That changes the rankings. - It was...

386
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:00,910
- just like that with me too. - Of course.

387
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:02,340
- All right. - So you have to get this right.

388
00:15:02,348 --> 00:15:03,340
I'll get it right by all means.

389
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,210
He's witty, after all.

390
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,580
- Here it goes. - Okay.

391
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:08,380
Kwang Soo, believe in your IQ.

392
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,990
(The picture for the quiz is presented.)

393
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,690
(What does the picture mean?)

394
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:13,850
Who drew this?

395
00:15:13,859 --> 00:15:16,090
- This is a terrible drawing. - What an awful drawing.

396
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:18,460
(Burning, sizzling)

397
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,290
This is too easy.

398
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,900
- Did you figure this out? - Are you serious?

399
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,265
- You know the answer? - Don't you get it?

400
00:15:25,738 --> 00:15:27,840
- "Burning and sizzling". - "Burning".

401
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,535
What's burning here?

402
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,805
- What's this? - The answer is on the drawing.

403
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,540
It's right in the drawing.

404
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:36,140
Is he bald?

405
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,410
- That's irrelevant. - Tell me the answer you have.

406
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,085
Go over there and tell him.

407
00:15:40,352 --> 00:15:42,180
(Certain of himself, Jae Seok tells the answer.)

408
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:43,450
If it's wrong, what an embarrassment he'll face.

409
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,325
(Certain of himself, Jae Seok tells the answer.)

410
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:51,125
(He showed off that he was good at figuring out clever jokes.)

411
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:54,160
(Jae Seok is full of wits.)

412
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:57,300
(He's certain of his answer.)

413
00:15:57,303 --> 00:15:58,700
Isn't that correct?

414
00:15:58,704 --> 00:15:59,930
- Is it correct? - Is it?

415
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:01,100
- Aren't I right? - Is it correct?

416
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,670
- Aren't I right? - Is it wrong?

417
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:03,800
(Did Jae Seok already know the answer?)

418
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,210
- It's wrong. - It's wrong?

419
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,440
- What did you tell him? - What was your answer?

420
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,980
- Gosh, what was that? - Tell us. What was it?

421
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,140
- I thought you knew. - My goodness.

422
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:12,150
- I thought you were better than us. - Dear me.

423
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:14,585
He was bragging.

424
00:16:14,653 --> 00:16:16,050
I thought it was "to be in a jam."

425
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,420
How does that even make sense?

426
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,550
- He's stuck here. - No, that's not right.

427
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,190
- Hey! - He's in a jam.

428
00:16:21,193 --> 00:16:22,590
- Where did you get "jam" from? - Right here.

429
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:25,230
- He's in a jam! - Do you think it'd be that easy?

430
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,430
Really? That wasn't right?

431
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:28,600
- Goodness. "To be in a jam?" - Okay, okay.

432
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,500
- Go ahead, Kwang Soo. - My friend with lower marks...

433
00:16:30,502 --> 00:16:31,970
really liked talking about that.

434
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,830
- That's all he ever talked about. - That's enough.

435
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,140
- Cut it out. - I'm embarrassed.

436
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,770
Gosh, how embarrassing.

437
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,510
It's been a while since my face turned red.

438
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,870
(He focuses on the drawing again.)

439
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,440
It's on his back. It's his back.

440
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,610
Is that his back or his bottom?

441
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:44,710
(Something on his back is burning.)

442
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,380
- Is that a pain-relief patch? - That's not it.

443
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,480
Is that a coal briquette?

444
00:16:47,486 --> 00:16:49,585
(Is that a pain-relief patch or a coal briquette?)

445
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:53,685
(The thing around his head seems to be burning.)

446
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:54,920
(Pain-relief patch...)

447
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:56,655
That's it.

448
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,030
It's that thing.

449
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,360
- It must be that. - I have the answer.

450
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:01,700
- That's right. - Pasta.

451
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,765
(Kwang Soo is certain that the answer is pasta.)

452
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:07,840
- That's right. - Pasta.

453
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,640
(He only gets one chance. Is "pasta" the answer?)

454
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:13,440
(If he's wrong, everyone will be dragged to the final destination.)

455
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:15,580
(Pasta)

456
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:17,240
- That's correct. - There you go!

457
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,780
- There you go! - That's right!

458
00:17:18,784 --> 00:17:20,180
- That's right. - Exactly.

459
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:21,750
(The pain-relief patch is burning. PASTA is an abbreviation of that.)

460
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:25,550
(As he completes the 3rd mission, his name tag lights up.)

461
00:17:25,557 --> 00:17:27,020
- There you go. - No wonder.

462
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,520
No wonder I kept...

463
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,320
- smelling the pasta. - Exactly.

464
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:33,090
- I smelled it the moment I got it. - It had a savory smell.

465
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:36,100
- Pasta was the answer. - Gosh, that's the pasta.

466
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,370
- It was pasta. - That's right.

467
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,430
Gosh, what a drawing.

468
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,770
- Okay. - He's good at this.

469
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:43,540
- We completed two of our missions. - Okay.

470
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,410
This is our third success.

471
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:47,040
- All right. - Next mission.

472
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,615
(Pick the 4th mission.)

473
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,010
This one.

474
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:55,050
(Jae Seok picks one without hesitation. What is it?)

475
00:17:55,054 --> 00:17:56,850
"Spin the Prince"?

476
00:17:56,855 --> 00:17:58,550
"Lift Jae Seok in your arms..."

477
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,825
"and spin him 5 times within 30 seconds."

478
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:04,390
(Spin Prince Jae Seok 5 times with power and speed.)

479
00:18:04,396 --> 00:18:06,460
(Mission complete)

480
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,630
- Like this? - This has to be Jong Kook.

481
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:08,830
We have no other choice than Jong Kook.

482
00:18:08,834 --> 00:18:11,565
- Definitely. - "Lift Jae Seok in your arms..."

483
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:14,370
(This mission is for Jong Kook, the symbol of strength.)

484
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:16,500
Jong Kook will have to do it.

485
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:17,710
Definitely.

486
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,840
It has to be either Jong Kook or Kwang Soo.

487
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,910
- We'll choose Jong Kook. - We'll go for Jong Kook.

488
00:18:21,914 --> 00:18:23,280
- Let's go. - Let's go.

489
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:24,350
Let's go!

490
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,980
(The fourth player, Jong Kook)

491
00:18:25,984 --> 00:18:29,280
(To Jong Kook's place in Nonhyeon-dong)

492
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,250
Let's go. Shouldn't we give him a call?

493
00:18:31,256 --> 00:18:32,950
(Let's go to Jong Kook's place.)

494
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:36,655
Gosh. They're always late.

495
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:39,090
Gosh. Seriously!

496
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:40,930
Why are you so late?

497
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:45,170
- What are you wearing? - This is in fashion these days.

498
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,840
- What's that? - You do this when it's not cold.

499
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,170
- I didn't know. - You wear it like this.

500
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,610
It's in fashion. You didn't know?

501
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,810
Jong Kook is getting more and more annoying.

502
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:55,180
(Jong Kook is getting more and more annoying.)

503
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,710
(Annoying fashionista)

504
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:58,950
All the others asked us to come to a park.

505
00:18:58,951 --> 00:19:00,610
Why did you ask us to come to your place?

506
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:02,720
We have a very sunny playground here.

507
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,490
Look. What do you think?

508
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:06,690
- It's pretty nice. - Right?

509
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,290
Will he succeed?

510
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:10,060
If he fails, it's over.

511
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:11,590
Did these two succeed?

512
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,190
- Yes. - Really?

513
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:15,500
- I flipped the ddakji at once, - I did a nonsense question.

514
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:16,630
- He got a nonsense question right. - Really?

515
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:18,600
Okay.

516
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,170
All-Success Mission.

517
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,070
Jong Kook's mission is...

518
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,140
Spin the Prince.

519
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:25,670
- Who is the prince? - Me.

520
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:27,470
(I'm the prince.)

521
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm the prince.

522
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:32,085
(Shameless)

523
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:35,220
I don't understand why you named it Spin the Prince.

524
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,850
Why would you?

525
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:39,290
- What's wrong? - I don't want to do it.

526
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,320
I'm not doing it.

527
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:42,090
What about Spin the Grasshopper or...

528
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:43,090
Exactly.

529
00:19:43,095 --> 00:19:45,390
- Spin the Grasshopper? - Spin the Grasshopper.

530
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:48,060
- Do you think you can do it? - Let me spin him once.

531
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,160
Just in case.

532
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,500
- Wait a minute. - Like this?

533
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:51,930
What does it have to do with a prince?

534
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,200
Try.

535
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,905
(Spinning)

536
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,040
(The prince looks hilarious.)

537
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,270
- Like this. - Good.

538
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,040
- Good. - There you go.

539
00:20:01,046 --> 00:20:02,875
That's not how you do it.

540
00:20:04,283 --> 00:20:05,350
There you go.

541
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,345
(Jae Seok is hit hard.)

542
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:11,925
(The pain is indescribable.)

543
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:13,020
Are you okay?

544
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:15,760
(The prince is in pain.)

545
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:16,820
Gosh.

546
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,530
Jae Seok won't be able to have...

547
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,290
a third child.

548
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:21,400
It's okay.

549
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,430
(He has to give up on having more children.)

550
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,200
- Gosh. - It's okay.

551
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:27,365
What?

552
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,540
- My goodness. - Guys.

553
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,640
(Seok Jin notices something.)

554
00:20:31,643 --> 00:20:36,275
We're probably going to fail. Devils are getting ready over there.

555
00:20:36,548 --> 00:20:41,680
(Are they the devils who are going to take us away?)

556
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:47,255
(If you fail, we'll take you to the final destination.)

557
00:20:49,094 --> 00:20:50,790
Let's be careful.

558
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,460
They're taking us to prison.

559
00:20:52,464 --> 00:20:53,560
Let's do this.

560
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,360
Start! Let me start.

561
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:57,735
- Start. - Quickly.

562
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:00,870
- Good. 1. - 1.

563
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:02,370
(1 spin within 3 seconds)

564
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:03,640
(Jong Kook seems to have no problem.)

565
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:05,210
Keep going.

566
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,240
- He's doing it. - He's doing it.

567
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,640
(He can actually do it.)

568
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,210
- Good. - Good.

569
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:10,980
- No! - No!

570
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:14,410
(The prince slips down.)

571
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,980
Lift me up.

572
00:21:15,988 --> 00:21:18,155
- Grab him somewhere. - Lift me up.

573
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,020
- We're in trouble. - Lift me up!

574
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:21,560
- Where are you? - Lift me up.

575
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,820
There you go.

576
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:23,820
Three.

577
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:24,860
(Jong Kook overcomes the crisis.)

578
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:26,490
(He spins Jae Seok for the 3rd time.)

579
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:27,590
It hurts!

580
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,130
Hang in there.

581
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:31,635
- You're almost done. - Hang in there!

582
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,105
Just one more spin.

583
00:21:35,974 --> 00:21:37,200
Just one more spin.

584
00:21:37,209 --> 00:21:39,870
(There is not much time left.)

585
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:41,440
Just one more spin!

586
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,710
- One more! - Please!

587
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:48,685
(They have half a spin to go. Will they finish in 4 seconds?)

588
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:50,880
- Stop! - Success!

589
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,190
- Done! - Are we done?

590
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,250
Success!

591
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,250
(Jong Kook did it!)

592
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:56,460
(They've completed the Spin the Prince mission.)

593
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:57,860
Okay!

594
00:21:57,863 --> 00:21:59,060
(Is this a dream?)

595
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:01,400
Go away, devils!

596
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,830
(Embarrassed)

597
00:22:03,835 --> 00:22:07,800
(With the 4th mission complete, Jong Kook's light turns on.)

598
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:11,100
- It must have really hurt. - Right?

599
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:13,470
I grabbed his skin.

600
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,040
- Hey. - Are you okay?

601
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,915
I...

602
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:18,980
I heard some noise. Are you okay?

603
00:22:18,984 --> 00:22:20,150
Hey.

604
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:21,750
Jong Kook...

605
00:22:21,753 --> 00:22:23,985
- This is so funny. - grabbed my skin.

606
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:27,150
Are you okay?

607
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:30,190
- How do you feel? - I was in a hurry.

608
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:31,830
He grabbed my skin.

609
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,090
(Jong Kook grabbed Jae Seok wherever he could.)

610
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,200
- He grabbed his skin. - This is so funny.

611
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,465
Our teamwork is great.

612
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:38,870
- Okay. - Okay.

613
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,530
- Success. - Success.

614
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:43,340
- Good job. - That was close.

615
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:44,870
Please pick the next mission.

616
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:47,870
How many times have we succeeded so far?

617
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,115
We have four more to go.

618
00:22:50,248 --> 00:22:52,880
(What's the fifth mission?)

619
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,210
What is it?

620
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:59,685
(Is the mission so hard that it shocks you?)

621
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,125
So Min!

622
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,390
So Min. She's an actress.

623
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:06,090
I choose So Min.

624
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:07,290
So Min.

625
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,730
- Will she be able to do it? - Is she good?

626
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:11,500
(The fifth player is So Min.)

627
00:23:11,503 --> 00:23:14,405
- We're halfway through now. - I know.

628
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,040
Things usually don't go this well.

629
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:20,275
- It feels weird, right? - Yes, it does.

630
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:22,440
Why are they so late?

631
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:24,315
Where are they?

632
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,515
Let's go.

633
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,120
This must be the place. Let's hurry.

634
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,055
(So Min is waiting inside.)

635
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,450
They're here.

636
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:34,585
(They're finally here.)

637
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,790
Guys, why are you so late?

638
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:38,290
- So Min. - Hi.

639
00:23:38,296 --> 00:23:39,330
You had your hair curled?

640
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:41,060
- Why are you so late? - Hey, don't laugh.

641
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:42,660
- Bring out your emotions. - Why?

642
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:44,600
I'm in a good mood. Hi.

643
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:46,270
(Why shouldn't she smile?)

644
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,540
Don't you see the devils? They're getting ready.

645
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,900
- You have to do a good job. - What's going on?

646
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:51,910
What is it?

647
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,445
(The devils are ready to take them to prison.)

648
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:56,210
All-Success Mission.

649
00:23:56,214 --> 00:23:59,415
So Min's mission is...

650
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:01,980
(It has to be So Min!)

651
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,080
So Min.

652
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:06,850
(As soon as they saw the mission, they all picked So Min.)

653
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,320
So Min's mission is...

654
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:11,455
(What's the mission they all chose So Min for?)

655
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:13,290
A Single Teardrop.

656
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:15,200
(A Single Teardrop)

657
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,335
A Single Teardrop.

658
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:19,470
You have 30 seconds...

659
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,740
to shed a teardrop to complete the mission.

660
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,775
You have only one chance.

661
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:28,080
Start!

662
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,040
(So suddenly?)

663
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:31,180
Already?

664
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,685
- Start! - Already?

665
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:35,550
Start.

666
00:24:35,554 --> 00:24:39,125
(She starts to focus.)

667
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:42,560
(Everything depends on So Min now.)

668
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:44,295
Please!

669
00:24:44,463 --> 00:24:46,795
- Done. - She's done.

670
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:54,570
(So Min manages to shed a teardrop.)

671
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:55,940
She did it.

672
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,100
I can't believe it.

673
00:24:57,109 --> 00:24:59,210
It popped out like computer graphics.

674
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:02,810
She squeezed it out. She squeezed it.

675
00:25:02,814 --> 00:25:04,140
- You're amazing. - Success.

676
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:05,950
(Is this really happening?)

677
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:07,010
Success.

678
00:25:07,018 --> 00:25:08,220
(The fifth mission, A Single Teardrop, is complete.)

679
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,420
- How could you do it so fast? - I forced it.

680
00:25:11,423 --> 00:25:13,120
Did you make your eyes hurt or did you bring up emotions?

681
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:15,390
I just... This is what I thought.

682
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:17,320
"If I fail, they'll beat me up."

683
00:25:17,329 --> 00:25:18,995
(If I fail, they'll beat me up.)

684
00:25:19,297 --> 00:25:21,060
- Really? - Really?

685
00:25:21,066 --> 00:25:23,530
- Are you talking about me? - Jong Kook played a big part.

686
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:24,870
(The Jong Kook effect)

687
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,165
It's good that I was here.

688
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:30,535
(The devils are disappointed.)

689
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:32,870
(With So Min completing her mission,)

690
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:35,210
(5 out of 8 lights are on.)

691
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:37,110
Succeed three more times, and we'll be done.

692
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:38,910
We can go home.

693
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,380
Next mission.

694
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,580
You can't tell us to come back. When it's over, it's over.

695
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:45,750
- We'll go home. - I won't turn back once.

696
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:46,850
- Let's do this. - We'll go home.

697
00:25:46,858 --> 00:25:49,695
- What is it? - "Person Quiz".

698
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,560
"By looking at the pictures of the eyes, nose, and lips,"

699
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:52,790
"guess which celebrity it is."

700
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:53,960
(Person Quiz)

701
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:55,360
Who should do it? Haha?

702
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,760
- Definitely not Ji Hyo. - Haha.

703
00:25:56,768 --> 00:25:58,930
Haha is good at guessing. Se Chan would be okay too.

704
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,330
- Se Chan... - He's good at guessing too.

705
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:02,540
Haha...

706
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:03,900
doesn't know many young celebrities.

707
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:05,570
That's right.

708
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:07,670
(Haha is getting old.)

709
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,840
- He doesn't. - You're right.

710
00:26:08,847 --> 00:26:10,840
- Se Chan would do better. - Se Chan...

711
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:13,480
- He knows a lot of celebrities. - He monitors many shows.

712
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:17,050
He meets celebrities in real life too.

713
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:18,715
He...

714
00:26:18,957 --> 00:26:20,220
(What are you saying?)

715
00:26:20,225 --> 00:26:23,760
- He's like a semi-celebrity. - Exactly. Se Chan.

716
00:26:23,762 --> 00:26:25,730
- Let's go. - Let's go for Se Chan.

717
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,560
- I think he's near here. - We finished too quickly.

718
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:32,130
I'm getting worried. The weather is getting worse.

719
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:34,570
I think I'll be the last person.

720
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,935
I don't want them to put all the blame on me.

721
00:26:38,243 --> 00:26:39,670
There he is.

722
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,170
Gosh.

723
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:42,710
Guys!

724
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:44,950
- It's raining. - It's raining.

725
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,180
As soon as we met you, it started raining.

726
00:26:47,185 --> 00:26:48,480
Let's hurry up.

727
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:51,990
- What have you been doing so far? - It's simple. We've all succeeded.

728
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,550
- Really? - We've all succeeded.

729
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,290
What's the mission? Is it the same for everyone?

730
00:26:55,293 --> 00:26:56,590
It's different for everyone.

731
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,890
- All-Success Mission. - Yes.

732
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,830
Se Chan's Mission is...

733
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,030
- Person Quiz. - Person Quiz?

734
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,260
You're good at these things.

735
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:05,870
- You know many celebrities. - I do.

736
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:07,000
He watches a lot of TV.

737
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:11,100
By looking at the pictures of the eyes, nose, and lips,

738
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:12,710
guess which celebrity it is to succeed.

739
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:14,540
- I think you'll get it right. - You have 15 seconds.

740
00:27:14,546 --> 00:27:15,980
(15 seconds)

741
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,980
- 15 seconds? - You have...

742
00:27:17,983 --> 00:27:19,750
- only one chance. - 15 seconds?

743
00:27:19,751 --> 00:27:22,520
- 15 seconds? - The others had 30 seconds.

744
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,090
I need at least 30 seconds.

745
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,520
It's too short.

746
00:27:26,524 --> 00:27:27,950
(He has 15 seconds and only 1 chance.)

747
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:29,290
Se Chan, come here.

748
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,460
- It's starting to rain a lot. - Here we go.

749
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:33,060
- One, - Let's do this.

750
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:34,190
two...

751
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,200
(The eyes, nose, and lips will be revealed.)

752
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,895
Three.

753
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,470
I have no clue.

754
00:27:43,475 --> 00:27:45,505
- It's a woman. - It's...

755
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,840
(I think I know.)

756
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,515
Se Chan.

757
00:27:49,714 --> 00:27:51,375
Isn't it...

758
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:54,310
You know many celebrities. You watch a lot of TV.

759
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,620
(Whose eyes, nose, and lips are they?)

760
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,950
I know the answer.

761
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:58,990
I'm very observant.

762
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,520
(He finally realizes who it is.)

763
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:04,760
(What is Se Chan's answer?)

764
00:28:04,763 --> 00:28:05,830
- Who is it? - Jennie.

765
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,300
(Se Chan's answer is Jennie.)

766
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,370
(If Jennie is the answer, they clear 6 missions consecutively.)

767
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:15,600
(If it's wrong, everyone will be locked up.)

768
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:16,800
(What's the result?)

769
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:18,040
It's correct.

770
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,740
(The answer is Jennie.)

771
00:28:19,744 --> 00:28:22,840
(Se Chan clears the mission.)

772
00:28:22,847 --> 00:28:25,150
- I know many celebrities. - That was amazing.

773
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,980
I would have not known.

774
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,380
- I had no idea. - You're amazing.

775
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:33,320
All of us might clear a mission.

776
00:28:33,325 --> 00:28:34,390
(They cleared 6 missions so far.)

777
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:35,620
That was great.

778
00:28:35,627 --> 00:28:38,990
Didn't I tell you that questions were well assigned?

779
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,660
Okay, let's go.

780
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,600
- Here you go. - How did he guess that?

781
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,300
(What's the next mission?)

782
00:28:45,303 --> 00:28:46,400
"Common sense".

783
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:48,970
(It's a common sense question.)

784
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:52,510
(Seventh mission is a common sense quiz.)

785
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,310
(Only two members remain, Haha and Ji Hyo.)

786
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:59,150
It's a competition between Messi and Ronaldo.

787
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,945
(Will it be Ji Hyo or Haha, who both have bad common sense?)

788
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:05,150
- Haha is better than Ji Hyo. - What?

789
00:29:05,156 --> 00:29:06,620
(Isn't Haha better than Ji Hyo?)

790
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,320
- Let's be honest. - Ji Hyo can't do it.

791
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:09,690
She's terrible with common sense.

792
00:29:09,694 --> 00:29:11,560
(They're at their greatest risk.)

793
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:13,590
This is incredible.

794
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,460
- Haha should do it. - It should be Haha.

795
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,100
- Next is Haha. - It should be Haha.

796
00:29:17,102 --> 00:29:19,470
- He's just in the front there. - Let's walk up to him.

797
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,900
- Can we walk there? - Yes, he's right there.

798
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:22,040
Really? Let's walk.

799
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,570
- Haha. - It's Haha.

800
00:29:23,575 --> 00:29:25,510
We expect a lot from you.

801
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,940
Haha.

802
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:28,510
This is an important moment.

803
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,980
You must feel pressured.

804
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:34,510
- All we need is you to succeed. - I agree that you were successful.

805
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,150
All we need is you to succeed.

806
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,280
(Swish)

807
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:39,750
(All we need is you to succeed.)

808
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:41,625
You should have come earlier.

809
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,660
(You should have come earlier.)

810
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:45,860
I'm the best with ddakji.

811
00:29:45,864 --> 00:29:48,730
Goodness, do you even know me?

812
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:49,860
- I knew it was you. - Jae Seok.

813
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:53,900
We spent so much time together.

814
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,670
- What about our time? - I know. Stop it.

815
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:57,200
We tried so many things together.

816
00:29:57,208 --> 00:30:00,110
- I went there first. - Stop it.

817
00:30:00,111 --> 00:30:02,110
- Is that so? - Stop it.

818
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:05,210
I'm so disappointed.

819
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,980
- Listen, Haha. - Why?

820
00:30:06,985 --> 00:30:08,850
This one is your chance.

821
00:30:08,853 --> 00:30:10,380
Don't be disappointed.

822
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:12,490
- Do this one, Haha. - What is it?

823
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,250
All-Success Mission.

824
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:17,020
Haha's mission is a common sense quiz.

825
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:20,090
(A common sense quiz)

826
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:21,560
Aren't you glad?

827
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,500
Gosh, you fool.

828
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:24,930
(He has nothing to say.)

829
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:26,100
I'm relieved.

830
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,870
You should've picked him who went to college.

831
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:31,670
We didn't know about it. It was randomly picked.

832
00:30:31,676 --> 00:30:33,670
It's actually making me feel good.

833
00:30:33,678 --> 00:30:35,010
- Doesn't it? - It's common sense.

834
00:30:35,013 --> 00:30:36,210
You're better than Ji Hyo.

835
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:37,940
You got a unanimous vote.

836
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,850
What's the question?

837
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,150
Here's the question.

838
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:45,620
Which has the most number of teeth?

839
00:30:45,623 --> 00:30:49,290
Number 1, shark. Number 2, crocodile.

840
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:52,090
Number 3, human. Number 4, snail.

841
00:30:52,097 --> 00:30:55,865
- A snail? - My goodness.

842
00:30:56,034 --> 00:30:58,600
(He has one chance to answer.)

843
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,200
(If he answers wrong, everyone goes to the final destination.)

844
00:31:00,205 --> 00:31:01,940
This isn't common sense.

845
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,970
Snail as a choice could be a trap.

846
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:08,010
That's very strange.

847
00:31:08,012 --> 00:31:09,480
Isn't it a trap?

848
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:12,410
It's confusing why snail is a choice.

849
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:15,620
It's definitely neither a crocodile nor a human.

850
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:21,020
Sharks have teeth in the front and the back.

851
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:23,290
I saw them.

852
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:25,190
So it's either a shark or a snail?

853
00:31:25,196 --> 00:31:27,360
Yes, it's either a shark or a snail.

854
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,830
Why is snail one of the choices?

855
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,970
Why is there a snail?

856
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,970
What's the answer?

857
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:34,605
(The snail seems confusing.)

858
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:40,510
(Which will Haha choose, a shark or a snail?)

859
00:31:40,512 --> 00:31:43,110
This is driving me insane.

860
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:44,940
(He's going nuts.)

861
00:31:44,949 --> 00:31:47,210
Hurry up. We don't have time.

862
00:31:47,218 --> 00:31:49,220
- Believe in yourself. - Five.

863
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,520
- Four. - Wait.

864
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,150
- Three. - Otherwise, we'll be eliminated.

865
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:53,720
- I have no idea. - 2, 1.

866
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:54,790
Number one, shark.

867
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,260
(Haha picks number one, shark.)

868
00:31:57,262 --> 00:32:01,325
(It's over if the answer is shark.)

869
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:05,900
(Is shark the right answer?)

870
00:32:05,904 --> 00:32:06,900
It's wrong.

871
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:08,900
(It's incorrect.)

872
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,370
(They fail their seventh mission.)

873
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:13,710
Is snail the answer?

874
00:32:13,711 --> 00:32:16,510
A shark has 300 teeth on average.

875
00:32:16,514 --> 00:32:18,240
A snail has 10,000...

876
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:21,110
- to 25,000 teeth. - That's right.

877
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,420
Wait a minute.

878
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,980
(Dark shadows appear.)

879
00:32:23,988 --> 00:32:26,120
- Come on. - Are they taking us already?

880
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,420
(We were so close.)

881
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:31,260
We were so close. What a waste, Haha.

882
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,030
Gosh, we were so close.

883
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:35,365
Where are they taking us?

884
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:38,400
Isn't anyone coming?

885
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:41,400
Why isn't anyone coming? I waited for a long time.

886
00:32:41,406 --> 00:32:44,300
(She's waiting without understanding the situation.)

887
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:46,370
(Moving awkwardly)

888
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:48,840
What's going on? You startled me.

889
00:32:48,846 --> 00:32:51,110
Who is it?

890
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,780
(Ji Hyo is taken to the final destination.)

891
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:54,610
Where are we going? Wait.

892
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:58,320
Who failed? Goodness.

893
00:32:58,323 --> 00:33:00,320
I heard the penalty will be terrible.

894
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,160
They said that it's a terrible penalty.

895
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,190
Apparently, it's much worse than what we've experienced.

896
00:33:05,196 --> 00:33:06,890
They said that it's insane.

897
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:10,200
- We must be here. - We stopped. He's parking.

898
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:11,460
- Where are we? - Do we get out?

899
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:12,700
(The vehicle stops somewhere.)

900
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,300
- What's going on? - What is it?

901
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:16,000
- We're here. Wait. - Are we leaving?

902
00:33:16,007 --> 00:33:18,100
- Is someone taking you? - Wait a minute.

903
00:33:18,109 --> 00:33:19,470
- Where are we? - Who is it?

904
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:20,910
- Wait. - I'm scared.

905
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:23,745
- What's going on? - They're taking us to a basement.

906
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,580
Where are you taking us?

907
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:27,880
(Why are they taking them to a basement?)

908
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:28,880
I'm scared.

909
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:29,950
(Ji Hyo also joins them.)

910
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,420
- What's going on? - Who is it?

911
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:33,720
- What? - Ji Hyo.

912
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,390
She's here. It's Ji Hyo.

913
00:33:35,393 --> 00:33:38,460
- Se Chan, where are you? - It's me. Come here.

914
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:41,695
Please take off your blindfolds.

915
00:33:43,768 --> 00:33:48,035
(They arrive at the final destination.)

916
00:33:48,873 --> 00:33:50,700
- What's going on? - What is it?

917
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:51,840
What's this?

918
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:53,040
Please take off your blindfolds.

919
00:33:53,044 --> 00:33:55,740
(What's this place?)

920
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:59,745
(What will we do here?)

921
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:01,480
What's that?

922
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:02,780
(A dartboard?)

923
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:03,780
What's that?

924
00:34:03,788 --> 00:34:04,950
(They're plastic dividers shaped into a pyramid.)

925
00:34:04,956 --> 00:34:07,120
- That must be the jail cell. - It is.

926
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,360
(There are name tag boxes.)

927
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,025
What's this?

928
00:34:11,963 --> 00:34:14,090
- Lights are off on mine. - There are name tags.

929
00:34:14,098 --> 00:34:16,460
They must be the members who didn't succeed.

930
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:17,760
(Lights are off on Haha and Ji Hyo's name tag.)

931
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:19,370
What's going on?

932
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,500
You only have one chance per mission.

933
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,210
You escape if you light up all the name tags.

934
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,980
If you fail, everyone will be penalized.

935
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,310
- All of us? - Everyone?

936
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:33,515
(Everyone will be penalized.)

937
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:37,880
Only 6 of us are lit because we cleared 6 missions.

938
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:40,020
Save me, please.

939
00:34:40,024 --> 00:34:42,160
- We have to escape. - Which one is Ji Hyo's?

940
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,360
It's right here.

941
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:44,890
It's this one.

942
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,690
This one is Ji Hyo's.

943
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,830
These must be where shoes go in, aren't they?

944
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,000
- Are they? - We throw our shoes.

945
00:34:53,004 --> 00:34:55,230
We need to put in five shoes.

946
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,940
- Put a shoe in each? - In each of them?

947
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:59,370
- How is it possible? - There's a dartboard.

948
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:01,010
Is there a dartboard?

949
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:02,645
It's a dartboard?

950
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:04,910
- It says "On". - "On" is written.

951
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:07,780
- What is it? - We have to hit "On".

952
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:09,620
Hit the bull's-eye?

953
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,120
- Goodness. - It will be difficult.

954
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,920
(If anyone hits "On", Haha's name tag will light up.)

955
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:16,390
- It doesn't seem easy. - You're right.

956
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,120
- There's a clock. - What do you mean?

957
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:19,560
What do you mean?

958
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:21,460
- Is the time running? - What's this?

959
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:22,460
(The given time is...)

960
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,100
- No way. - Let's hurry.

961
00:35:24,102 --> 00:35:27,035
- The time is running. - The clock is running.

962
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:30,100
If you don't clear the mission within 10 minutes,

963
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,570
you will be penalized.

964
00:35:31,576 --> 00:35:33,710
- Can we practice? - You can practice.

965
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:36,010
- Shall we do a simulation? - Let's hurry.

966
00:35:36,013 --> 00:35:38,680
We only need to light two name tags.

967
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:39,850
Shall I throw it?

968
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,580
(It's important to distribute appropriate time for practice.)

969
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:44,520
You have to throw the dart inside the line.

970
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:46,490
- Inside the line? - Wait a minute.

971
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:47,920
You don't even know how to play darts.

972
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:50,590
- Gosh. - I spent my life playing darts.

973
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:52,490
- You went to a dart cafe twice. - Let's go.

974
00:35:52,497 --> 00:35:54,090
- Go. - You can do it.

975
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:55,460
We only need one person to hit it.

976
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:56,700
(Bouncing off)

977
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,900
My goodness.

978
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:00,670
It didn't stick.

979
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:02,840
- Is that a fail? - She failed.

980
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,870
- It doesn't stick. - Why didn't mine stick?

981
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:07,775
(She throws it easily.)

982
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:11,245
(It sticks near the target.)

983
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,510
That was so close.

984
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:15,110
It was so close.

985
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,420
She's good at everything.

986
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:18,750
- We don't have time. - She did well the first time.

987
00:36:18,756 --> 00:36:20,850
Throw it harder than you think.

988
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:22,660
(What?)

989
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,690
Throw it harder than you think.

990
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:26,960
(He chooses his own target.)

991
00:36:26,964 --> 00:36:29,125
What have you done?

992
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,560
What is he doing?

993
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:31,700
(It's harder to hit that spot.)

994
00:36:31,702 --> 00:36:33,730
- What have you done? - Where's your target?

995
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:35,970
- It could have been dangerous. - What did you do?

996
00:36:35,973 --> 00:36:37,200
He threw a dart toward the camera.

997
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:39,410
- He's worse than Ji Hyo. - Kwang Soo.

998
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,145
That was incredible.

999
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,880
That was so incredible.

1000
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,310
I'm not good at playing darts.

1001
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:48,310
Unless you throw it hard, it won't stick.

1002
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:50,480
- Ji Hyo didn't throw it hard. - It won't stick.

1003
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:53,220
Don't step beyond the line.

1004
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,120
- Hold him back. Go straight. - Okay.

1005
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,490
- Pull his leg. - That's right.

1006
00:36:56,494 --> 00:37:00,130
- That's not how you play darts. - That's right.

1007
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,860
(He takes a better aim with long arms and legs.)

1008
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,960
- Go closer. - That's good.

1009
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:06,435
Can you grab his hand?

1010
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:08,735
You can go closer.

1011
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:10,670
- Throw it. - It's "The Creation of Adam".

1012
00:37:10,675 --> 00:37:12,335
Go.

1013
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,310
Throw it.

1014
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:15,780
You got it.

1015
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,215
- Throw it. - Throw it.

1016
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:21,680
- Goodness. - That was close.

1017
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,620
(It didn't stick.)

1018
00:37:23,621 --> 00:37:26,090
- That was close. - Is something wrong with the board?

1019
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,120
This isn't working.

1020
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:29,290
- It's difficult. - It's difficult.

1021
00:37:29,293 --> 00:37:31,360
The darts won't stick.

1022
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,860
We don't have time.

1023
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:35,030
- Let's get our shoes ready. - Shoes.

1024
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,500
- We don't have time. - Let's throw the shoes.

1025
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:38,300
- Next are the shoes. - We'll throw our shoes.

1026
00:37:38,302 --> 00:37:39,700
Get over here now.

1027
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:41,100
- Hurry up. - Here we go.

1028
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,900
- Line up. - Hurry up.

1029
00:37:42,907 --> 00:37:45,340
- Hurry up. - The top part is going to be hard.

1030
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:46,870
That top section would be the hardest.

1031
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:50,280
- We should all go for that section. - You know I'm good at this, right?

1032
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:52,710
You'll definitely succeed.

1033
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,850
(After bouncing off the second section,)

1034
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:56,450
(it goes back in.)

1035
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:59,150
- That's a good one. - Nice!

1036
00:37:59,156 --> 00:38:01,325
How should we do the top part?

1037
00:38:01,492 --> 00:38:03,255
Let me try.

1038
00:38:03,794 --> 00:38:07,325
(Will Ji Hyo get the hang of the shoe game too?)

1039
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,860
(It hits the first section...)

1040
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,935
(and then bounces off.)

1041
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,140
That was close.

1042
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,940
(She might succeed in the real game.)

1043
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:19,970
That was so close.

1044
00:38:19,977 --> 00:38:22,075
- She did well. - That was close.

1045
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,210
Good!

1046
00:38:24,215 --> 00:38:25,750
Good job, So Min.

1047
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:26,750
(Even if you aim for the first section,)

1048
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:27,880
(it's hard to succeed.)

1049
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,720
- Gosh. - You're so bad.

1050
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,080
Why were you being so ambitious?

1051
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:33,420
I was aiming for the bottom part.

1052
00:38:33,424 --> 00:38:36,120
- Can you hold my hand? - Okay.

1053
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,395
Everyone hold his hand.

1054
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:39,760
- Can I lean forward? - Are we doing this again?

1055
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:40,830
You can go even further.

1056
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,130
- A little further. - You have to lean forward.

1057
00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,760
- A bit further. - Even further.

1058
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,260
- Further. - There you go.

1059
00:38:45,269 --> 00:38:46,600
Can you throw your shoe?

1060
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:47,670
It looks promising.

1061
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,800
(I trust my body to the other members.)

1062
00:38:48,806 --> 00:38:50,570
- A bit further. - Even further.

1063
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,700
Can you throw your shoe?

1064
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:53,745
(I'm flying.)

1065
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,680
(The heroine had the hero behind her back...)

1066
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,350
(to hold her hands.)

1067
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,620
(Behind me is...)

1068
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:06,255
Who is pulling my hair?

1069
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,450
(They pull Kwang Soo's hair with love.)

1070
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,255
We'll hold your hair.

1071
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:11,460
We'll hold it.

1072
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:12,830
(From head to toe, he gives his body to the members.)

1073
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,895
Straighten your leg.

1074
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:17,295
(Throwing)

1075
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:20,800
There you go!

1076
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:23,305
(It lands in the fifth section easily.)

1077
00:39:24,075 --> 00:39:26,140
That wasn't what we were going for!

1078
00:39:26,143 --> 00:39:28,810
(We were going for the first section!)

1079
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:30,840
Everyone can do this.

1080
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,180
Who can't do this?

1081
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:33,750
- Gosh. - It might bounce off.

1082
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:36,780
- It's not that easy. - It might bounce off.

1083
00:39:36,787 --> 00:39:40,050
- It might bounce off. - The top section is the hardest.

1084
00:39:40,057 --> 00:39:41,920
(The top section is definitely the hardest.)

1085
00:39:41,926 --> 00:39:44,190
- It's too hard. - Let's hurry up.

1086
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:45,760
We're running out of time.

1087
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:47,660
- We have limited time. - Let's hurry up.

1088
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:49,660
- We should hurry up. - Let's do the shoe game first.

1089
00:39:49,667 --> 00:39:51,230
- The shoe game. - We'll start the shoe game.

1090
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:52,730
Hurry up!

1091
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:54,670
If we fail once, it's over.

1092
00:39:54,672 --> 00:39:55,700
- Start! - Start!

1093
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:56,940
- We have to hurry up. - Hurry up!

1094
00:39:56,941 --> 00:39:58,400
Line up.

1095
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,245
(They have to hurry up and focus at the same time.)

1096
00:40:05,783 --> 00:40:06,880
Okay!

1097
00:40:06,884 --> 00:40:09,315
Move on.

1098
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:10,985
Line up.

1099
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:14,890
(Is he going for the first section?)

1100
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:16,260
- Okay! - Okay!

1101
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,260
Good.

1102
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:20,230
(Just like during practice, his shoe goes into the second section.)

1103
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:21,895
Good!

1104
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:24,265
- It's amazing. - It's unbelievable.

1105
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,705
(It's Se Chan's turn.)

1106
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:27,930
Fail.

1107
00:40:27,938 --> 00:40:31,800
(It bounces off the wall.)

1108
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,645
- It almost went in. - It bounces off.

1109
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:37,845
It's hard.

1110
00:40:37,915 --> 00:40:38,980
Start!

1111
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:41,850
(Seok Jin has been the dark horse lately.)

1112
00:40:41,852 --> 00:40:46,085
(Everything he wishes for comes true.)

1113
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:48,920
(As soon as he shouts, "Start",)

1114
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:52,190
(it brings success.)

1115
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:55,860
(Jee's magic takes over the world.)

1116
00:40:55,866 --> 00:40:57,160
Start!

1117
00:40:57,168 --> 00:41:01,635
(Will his magic work this time too?)

1118
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,700
Which one do you want? The farthest one?

1119
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,170
That's the most difficult one.

1120
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:10,175
(On its way to the third section, the shoe bounces off.)

1121
00:41:10,314 --> 00:41:15,045
(Will it end up in the first section?)

1122
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:20,490
(Jee's magic comes to an end.)

1123
00:41:20,491 --> 00:41:21,550
It bounced out.

1124
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,155
- Focus. - What's with you?

1125
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,590
- Just ask to let it go. - Okay, So Min.

1126
00:41:26,597 --> 00:41:28,060
Let's go for the closet first.

1127
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,300
I'll go for a close one.

1128
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,260
- The middle... - We don't have much time, do we?

1129
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,235
- Hurry up. - Start.

1130
00:41:33,304 --> 00:41:35,435
(So Min casually throws her shoes.)

1131
00:41:42,513 --> 00:41:44,080
- Okay! - Two more to go.

1132
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:45,810
If you fail, it'll be a shame.

1133
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,680
(The 1st and 5th sections are left.)

1134
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:48,780
Hurry.

1135
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,685
(The 6th player, Haha, throws his shoe.)

1136
00:41:52,323 --> 00:41:54,055
- Okay! - Yes!

1137
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:01,325
(Haha's shoe lands in the first section.)

1138
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,500
(It's hard to believe.)

1139
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:05,800
- Unbelievable. - It's Kwang Soo's turn.

1140
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:07,070
Kwang Soo.

1141
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:08,930
- Kwang Soo. - Kwang Soo.

1142
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:10,700
- We can do this. - Kwang Soo.

1143
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,270
(We just have to repeat what we did during practice.)

1144
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:13,670
- Keep going. - We can do this.

1145
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:15,340
- Even further. - We've done this.

1146
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,410
(The tip of Kwang Soo's foot...)

1147
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:17,840
Kwang Soo.

1148
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:18,940
Kwang Soo!

1149
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,710
(Everyone's fate relies on Kwang Soo's foot.)

1150
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:22,010
You can do this.

1151
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,380
Stay calm.

1152
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:24,750
- Focus. - Focus.

1153
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:28,350
(We need to become one...)

1154
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,790
(to turn on Ji Hyo's light.)

1155
00:42:29,794 --> 00:42:32,825
We can do this. We've done this before.

1156
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:36,960
(We work together...)

1157
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:38,060
Kwang Soo.

1158
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:41,505
(We work together to succeed.)

1159
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,470
(It bounces off Se Chan's shoe.)

1160
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:46,445
(It's in!)

1161
00:42:48,712 --> 00:42:49,910
It's in.

1162
00:42:49,914 --> 00:42:52,110
(Kwang Soo didn't do this alone.)

1163
00:42:52,116 --> 00:42:57,020
(He did it with his team.)

1164
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:59,550
He made it. It's in.

1165
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:00,620
We succeeded.

1166
00:43:00,624 --> 00:43:04,460
We saved Ji Hyo. Ji Hyo's light is on.

1167
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:06,130
- We need to save Haha now. - Save me.

1168
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,760
We have to win in darts too.

1169
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:10,700
- It's connected to my light. - Darts.

1170
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,930
It's hard. We have to hurry up.

1171
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:14,300
This is unbelievable.

1172
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:15,600
(They have to succeed in 3 minutes to escape from the place.)

1173
00:43:15,606 --> 00:43:19,410
- You did an amazing job. - I spent three years playing darts.

1174
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,240
- Really? - In Donam-dong...

1175
00:43:21,245 --> 00:43:24,210
- We don't have much time. - That's enough.

1176
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:25,910
Your arm shouldn't go back.

1177
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,910
- It didn't go back. - Hurry up.

1178
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:30,055
1, 2, 3. Start!

1179
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:33,825
(How good is he?)

1180
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,025
What's with you?

1181
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:39,630
Why didn't it go in? I threw it hard.

1182
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,630
It bounced off.

1183
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:42,860
There's something wrong with the board.

1184
00:43:42,867 --> 00:43:44,230
Gosh, it's hard.

1185
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:46,705
- It's hard. - We need to hurry up.

1186
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:49,000
Let me start.

1187
00:43:49,006 --> 00:43:51,940
(He looks stable.)

1188
00:43:51,942 --> 00:43:56,715
(The dart makes a perfect arc.)

1189
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:58,980
It hit the board.

1190
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:00,710
It hit "ON".

1191
00:44:00,718 --> 00:44:02,715
(That was close.)

1192
00:44:03,988 --> 00:44:06,150
(It did hit "ON"...)

1193
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:07,890
(and fell.)

1194
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,560
It hit the board.

1195
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,855
It hit "ON".

1196
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:13,230
- It hit "ON". - Normally,

1197
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,960
you shouldn't throw it like a baseball.

1198
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:17,430
- But we have to do it here. - Okay.

1199
00:44:17,434 --> 00:44:19,000
- Like this? - Like this.

1200
00:44:19,003 --> 00:44:20,130
- Should we throw it hard? - Yes.

1201
00:44:20,137 --> 00:44:21,530
Very hard?

1202
00:44:21,538 --> 00:44:23,470
It perfectly hit "ON", right?

1203
00:44:23,474 --> 00:44:24,570
(Darts seems to be a lot harder.)

1204
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:29,005
(Time is running out.)

1205
00:44:30,614 --> 00:44:34,415
(Se Chan gets ready to throw the dart like a baseball.)

1206
00:44:36,687 --> 00:44:37,820
It works if you throw it hard.

1207
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:41,455
(The dart went into the board.)

1208
00:44:42,326 --> 00:44:43,490
(The 4th player, Haha, gets ready.)

1209
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:45,655
I can't do that.

1210
00:44:47,598 --> 00:44:49,130
We don't have much time!

1211
00:44:49,133 --> 00:44:50,500
(There are 2 minutes and 4 players left.)

1212
00:44:50,501 --> 00:44:52,770
It should make an arc.

1213
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:54,730
(The 5th player, So Min, fails.)

1214
00:44:54,738 --> 00:44:56,675
Please save me.

1215
00:44:57,608 --> 00:45:00,310
(The ace, Ji Hyo, is ready.)

1216
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,710
(Will she make a miracle happen?)

1217
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:05,610
(Even Ji Hyo fails.)

1218
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:06,850
We have to save Haha.

1219
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:09,180
It's not just Haha, we have to save the whole team.

1220
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:13,585
(There are only two players left.)

1221
00:45:14,224 --> 00:45:15,960
(High strength)

1222
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,560
(Low accuracy)

1223
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:21,160
(Jae Seok)

1224
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,230
(High accuracy)

1225
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:25,800
(Low strength)

1226
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:28,635
(Kwang Soo)

1227
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:32,670
(If their strengths can be combined, they'll be able to succeed.)

1228
00:45:32,676 --> 00:45:35,910
(Will they fail to escape?)

1229
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:36,980
We have to save Haha.

1230
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:40,310
(Their fate relies on these two guys' hands.)

1231
00:45:40,317 --> 00:45:43,415
It's not just Haha, we have to save the whole team.

1232
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:48,085
There you go!

1233
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:50,425
What?

1234
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:53,665
(He hit the target right in the center.)

1235
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:55,760
(What just happened?)

1236
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:57,430
Unbelievable.

1237
00:45:57,434 --> 00:45:58,960
- You did it. - Good job.

1238
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,400
(With Jae Seok hitting the mark, the time stops.)

1239
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:02,470
You did it.

1240
00:46:02,473 --> 00:46:03,670
- What did I just do? - He did it.

1241
00:46:03,674 --> 00:46:05,370
- It gave me goosebumps. - Haha's light is on.

1242
00:46:05,376 --> 00:46:06,570
Haha's light is one.

1243
00:46:06,577 --> 00:46:07,810
We did it!

1244
00:46:07,811 --> 00:46:09,110
(Haha's light is on.)

1245
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:12,080
- We succeeded. How did you do it? - We did it.

1246
00:46:12,082 --> 00:46:13,410
How is this possible?

1247
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,780
- What just happened? - Did we really make it?

1248
00:46:15,786 --> 00:46:19,050
- He just casually threw it. - What did I do?

1249
00:46:19,056 --> 00:46:22,090
I can't believe it.

1250
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:24,795
You've completed the mission.

1251
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:26,760
It feels weird.

1252
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:28,760
You managed to turn on all of the eight lights...

1253
00:46:28,766 --> 00:46:31,100
- within the given time. - I can't believe it.

1254
00:46:31,101 --> 00:46:33,670
You can now get out of this building...

1255
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,930
and go home.

1256
00:46:35,939 --> 00:46:37,040
We can go home?

1257
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:38,300
(They can go home.)

1258
00:46:38,308 --> 00:46:39,810
- We can go home? - We can go home?

1259
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:41,710
- Are we really done? - We can go home?

1260
00:46:41,712 --> 00:46:43,210
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1261
00:46:43,213 --> 00:46:45,010
- We can really go home? - We can go home?

1262
00:46:45,015 --> 00:46:47,410
We finished shooting before the stock market closes.

1263
00:46:47,418 --> 00:46:48,750
(The stock market closes at 3:30pm.)

1264
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:50,520
This has never happened before.

1265
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:52,080
- We're done? - We can go home.

1266
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:53,920
- Ji Hyo. - We're really done?

1267
00:46:53,924 --> 00:46:55,550
- Can we really go home? - Bye.

1268
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,320
- Thank you for today. - This is a new record.

1269
00:46:57,327 --> 00:46:59,125
I should go to the gym.

1270
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:02,430
(After some unexpected rest, they meet for the next shooting.)

1271
00:47:02,433 --> 00:47:06,200
- Hi. - Hi.

1272
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:08,100
(A university campus in Paju)

1273
00:47:08,105 --> 00:47:10,440
It's suddenly so cold today,

1274
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,000
but it's very sunny.

1275
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:14,040
- It's perfect. - It's very sunny.

1276
00:47:14,044 --> 00:47:15,670
Jong Kook is finally wearing pants!

1277
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:17,140
Oh, my.

1278
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:18,680
Jong Kook is finally wearing pants!

1279
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:19,680
Oh, my.

1280
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:21,110
Winter is here.

1281
00:47:21,118 --> 00:47:22,510
- Today... - It's already winter.

1282
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:24,450
we're shooting in Paju.

1283
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:27,250
- You almost made me cry. - Why?

1284
00:47:27,257 --> 00:47:29,290
You're wearing pants a bit earlier than the past years.

1285
00:47:29,293 --> 00:47:32,930
(You're wearing pants a bit earlier than the past years.)

1286
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:35,730
You don't normally wear them until November.

1287
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:38,035
It's about two weeks earlier this year.

1288
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:39,360
(Is he really okay?)

1289
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:41,370
At night, it's a lot colder here than in Seoul.

1290
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:43,300
I'm disappointed.

1291
00:47:43,307 --> 00:47:46,370
You started wearing pants around mid-December.

1292
00:47:46,376 --> 00:47:47,440
(Everyone gets old.)

1293
00:47:47,444 --> 00:47:49,745
It makes me sad.

1294
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,910
Did Jong Kook get weaker?

1295
00:47:51,915 --> 00:47:53,080
Get over it, Jong Kook.

1296
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,110
"Get over it"?

1297
00:47:54,118 --> 00:47:55,850
- Okay. - Okay, okay.

1298
00:47:55,853 --> 00:47:57,450
- Aren't you cold? - I'm not.

1299
00:47:57,454 --> 00:47:58,450
- Aren't you cold? - I'm warm.

1300
00:47:58,455 --> 00:48:00,890
Does your youngest child take after you?

1301
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:02,650
(Does your youngest child take after you?)

1302
00:48:02,659 --> 00:48:04,390
I'm not sure yet.

1303
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:06,490
- I want to know. - I'm not sure yet.

1304
00:48:06,497 --> 00:48:08,930
- She's still a baby. - She's still a baby.

1305
00:48:08,932 --> 00:48:13,330
Her face becomes more defined after 2 to 3 weeks.

1306
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:15,200
You must be anxious every day.

1307
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:16,700
(You must be anxious every day.)

1308
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:19,300
I'm very anxious these days.

1309
00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:21,010
(We hope that she doesn't take after him.)

1310
00:48:21,011 --> 00:48:22,670
- I'm anxious. - She should take after her mom.

1311
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,480
- She should take after her mom. - That's right.

1312
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:27,910
I'm praying a lot these days.

1313
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:30,520
Usually, the eldest takes after the father.

1314
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:31,580
- Really? - Yes.

1315
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:33,190
- Aren't you relieved? - She's the youngest.

1316
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,120
She'll be okay since she's the youngest.

1317
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,720
- Is that so? - Yes.

1318
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,520
The nose of my child...

1319
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:41,430
didn't look like mine when he was young.

1320
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:43,700
(He talks about his son Hyun Woo.)

1321
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:46,570
- Then? - When he turned 12,

1322
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,100
- his nose got bigger. - Really?

1323
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:49,540
- It became... - Did it get bigger?

1324
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
- When he was 12? - It grew like a mushroom.

1325
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,540
That's not good.

1326
00:48:53,544 --> 00:48:55,140
- It got... - Did it get wider?

1327
00:48:55,145 --> 00:48:56,840
His nose got wider.

1328
00:48:56,847 --> 00:48:59,510
- His nose became wider. - Hyun Woo is handsome.

1329
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:01,010
He is handsome.

1330
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:03,450
- Hyun Woo is very handsome. - He's also tall.

1331
00:49:03,453 --> 00:49:05,020
- He was amazing. - Sons take after their mother.

1332
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:06,120
Daughters take after their father.

1333
00:49:06,123 --> 00:49:08,190
- That's right. - She can get braces.

1334
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:11,060
For today, could you take it off?

1335
00:49:11,061 --> 00:49:12,290
(Could you take off the black cloth?)

1336
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:13,560
There's something underneath.

1337
00:49:13,564 --> 00:49:15,060
- What is it? - What is it?

1338
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:16,695
(What is that?)

1339
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:20,170
(Mysterious objects stand on the side.)

1340
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,470
- Both of them? - Take them off.

1341
00:49:21,471 --> 00:49:22,570
We'll take them off.

1342
00:49:22,573 --> 00:49:24,600
(What is it?)

1343
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:26,635
- What's that? - What?

1344
00:49:26,643 --> 00:49:28,905
- What? - What is it?

1345
00:49:29,379 --> 00:49:31,880
(The staff has prepared...)

1346
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:35,180
(the last traitor that remains in the science of 21st century.)

1347
00:49:35,185 --> 00:49:36,220
(Shocked)

1348
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,315
This is the worst.

1349
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:40,720
That looks scary.

1350
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,360
Why didn't you get rid of the mustache?

1351
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,960
My goodness.

1352
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:46,160
It's okay.

1353
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:47,860
(It will make them burst out laughing.)

1354
00:49:47,864 --> 00:49:50,600
(What could it be?)

1355
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:52,300
(It's made with advanced computer graphics.)

1356
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:54,535
They're combined.

1357
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:57,700
(What will happen...)

1358
00:49:57,708 --> 00:50:01,340
(when So Min meets other male members?)

1359
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,615
(Horrible)

1360
00:50:06,016 --> 00:50:08,380
(What will happen...)

1361
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:11,980
(when Ji Hyo meets other male members?)

1362
00:50:11,989 --> 00:50:15,955
(Silly-looking faces)

1363
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:18,695
(He winces.)

1364
00:50:19,329 --> 00:50:20,990
- It's the worst. - It's the worst.

1365
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:22,290
It really is.

1366
00:50:22,299 --> 00:50:25,160
Se Chan plus So Min looks terrible.

1367
00:50:25,168 --> 00:50:26,800
Look at that.

1368
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:29,100
One person had such a big influence.

1369
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:31,040
(It's just Se Chan.)

1370
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:33,810
I'm so ugly. I'm sorry.

1371
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:34,810
I'm sorry.

1372
00:50:34,811 --> 00:50:36,280
(Se Chan's genes eliminates So Min's.)

1373
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,280
Mixing with my face is a penalty.

1374
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:42,150
This happens when their daughter takes after her father.

1375
00:50:42,152 --> 00:50:43,220
No way.

1376
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,720
(This happens when their daughter takes after her father.)

1377
00:50:45,722 --> 00:50:47,490
I must have a son.

1378
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:49,290
It's the worst.

1379
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:50,490
(It's terrible to imagine.)

1380
00:50:50,494 --> 00:50:52,590
- It's so funny. - Se Chan with Ji Hyo...

1381
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:53,990
look okay.

1382
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:55,930
No matter how pretty she is...

1383
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:57,700
When Se Chan is involved, the face gets ugly.

1384
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:59,730
Let's never be together.

1385
00:50:59,736 --> 00:51:02,370
You have such strong features.

1386
00:51:02,372 --> 00:51:03,800
Goodness.

1387
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,240
Don't give birth to a daughter.

1388
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,810
He's a champion. I'm so sorry.

1389
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:10,310
This one looks like a handsome man.

1390
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:12,140
(It's Ji Hyo and Haha.)

1391
00:51:12,149 --> 00:51:14,510
Why didn't you get rid of the mustache?

1392
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:16,720
Why did you add the mustache?

1393
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,615
This one looks perverted.

1394
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:22,885
This one looks gross.

1395
00:51:24,227 --> 00:51:25,860
- Kwang Soo. - Listen.

1396
00:51:25,862 --> 00:51:28,460
Haha and So Min's looks like a man with long hair.

1397
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:29,830
It looks like Sung Hoon.

1398
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:33,735
So Min, ours looks okay without the mustache.

1399
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:35,500
(Is it just the mustache?)

1400
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:37,700
Kwang Soo and So Min.

1401
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:39,840
It looks like Ae Bong from "The Sound of Your Heart".

1402
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:42,605
(He points to So Min and Kwang Soo.)

1403
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,840
- This is... - You're right.

1404
00:51:44,848 --> 00:51:46,010
definitely it.

1405
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:49,050
Kwang Soo and So Min's mix looks annoying.

1406
00:51:49,052 --> 00:51:51,480
What did he say? Why does it look annoying?

1407
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:53,920
- The face is attractive. - It's very annoying.

1408
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:56,460
Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo's mix looks sad.

1409
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,520
"Sad"?

1410
00:51:57,527 --> 00:51:58,820
It looks very sad.

1411
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:00,390
It looks creepy.

1412
00:52:00,397 --> 00:52:02,390
I can see both of our faces, and it's creepy.

1413
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:04,560
Isn't with Jong Kook the best?

1414
00:52:04,568 --> 00:52:07,500
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's mix looks just like Ji Hyo.

1415
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:09,570
Me and Ji Hyo together looks the best.

1416
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,770
Jong Kook and Ji Hyo's mix looks pretty.

1417
00:52:11,775 --> 00:52:13,470
It'd be great if we have a daughter.

1418
00:52:13,477 --> 00:52:15,110
Me and Seok Jin looks okay too.

1419
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:17,340
- It looks good. - Seok Jin and Ji Hyo?

1420
00:52:17,347 --> 00:52:19,240
The lower part is similar to mine.

1421
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:21,410
Me and Ji Hyo's looks intelligent.

1422
00:52:21,418 --> 00:52:22,450
- Doesn't it look okay? - Yes.

1423
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:24,320
- It looks like a doctor. - It looks intelligent.

1424
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:26,120
It'd be perfect as a doctor.

1425
00:52:26,123 --> 00:52:28,850
The photos that involve me look smart.

1426
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:31,760
This one looks like someone who's smart.

1427
00:52:31,762 --> 00:52:35,490
It's someone successful. This one is still a student.

1428
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:36,730
(It's a senior in high school.)

1429
00:52:36,733 --> 00:52:39,160
Jae Seok, this one looks like Park Hwi Soon.

1430
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:40,970
It's definitely Hwi Soon.

1431
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:42,800
It's Park Hwi Soon.

1432
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:45,770
Me and So Min's doesn't look anything like us.

1433
00:52:45,776 --> 00:52:46,970
So Min.

1434
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,570
You and Seok Jin look horrible.

1435
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:51,340
What are you talking about? It's not bad.

1436
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:53,080
(It's Seok Jin with short hair.)

1437
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:56,545
- Seok Jin's nose is apparent. - I know.

1438
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:58,350
- This is incredible. - They look okay.

1439
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:01,320
The technology has advanced. They look natural.

1440
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,790
I cried because it was so funny.

1441
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:04,660
Did you enjoy the photos?

1442
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:06,630
- Why did you make these? - Why?

1443
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,660
All of a sudden?

1444
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,660
Here's the secret to the photos.

1445
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:12,430
Today is a couple race called Familiar Partner.

1446
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:14,265
"Familiar Partner"?

1447
00:53:15,205 --> 00:53:17,000
It's a couple race.

1448
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:18,340
It's people that we know.

1449
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:21,570
Behind these four doors,

1450
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:26,115
there are four female returning guests whom you know.

1451
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:27,650
Today,

1452
00:53:27,651 --> 00:53:29,580
you'll look at rendered photos.

1453
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:32,420
Then you will pick the partner you like.

1454
00:53:32,422 --> 00:53:33,490
- Is that so? - As a couple?

1455
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:34,650
Do you have the rendered photos?

1456
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:38,090
Guests will accept the partner if they wish.

1457
00:53:38,094 --> 00:53:39,360
If not,

1458
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:42,765
you may let others choose him.

1459
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:48,700
Two members who aren't chosen will be picked by Ji Hyo and So Min.

1460
00:53:48,705 --> 00:53:51,100
They'll be generous enough to pair up with them.

1461
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:52,500
- That's sweet. - Gosh.

1462
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:53,910
So Min and Ji Hyo...

1463
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:56,510
will be saving those who aren't chosen.

1464
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:58,140
From their perspective,

1465
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:00,210
they may not be happy.

1466
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:01,380
Right.

1467
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:03,745
Everyone might try not to be chosen.

1468
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,850
- You're right. - That's possible.

1469
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:08,990
(We never know.)

1470
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,390
(What kind of couples will form?)

1471
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:12,760
- Shall we take a look? - Reveal the photos.

1472
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:14,830
Who are the guests?

1473
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:18,130
Anyone with me will look terrible.

1474
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:21,870
(Who has the best genes will be clear.)

1475
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:24,270
(4 familiar partners)

1476
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:27,675
(How will their rendered photos look?)

1477
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:31,640
(It's beyond imagination.)

1478
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:33,950
- What are these? - Don't.

1479
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,710
- Look at this. - Stop it.

1480
00:54:35,719 --> 00:54:38,380
I feel terrible for them.

1481
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:40,220
- She's beautiful. - Let's start with this person.

1482
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:42,190
- She's beautiful. - She is.

1483
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:43,490
She's very...

1484
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:45,560
The first guest is really beautiful.

1485
00:54:45,562 --> 00:54:47,530
She's pretty. Who is she?

1486
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:49,260
- Look at this. - You're right.

1487
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:50,560
She's beautiful.

1488
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,260
Me and her look good, right?

1489
00:54:52,269 --> 00:54:53,770
- It looks good. - It's not bad at all.

1490
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,170
- It looks good. - It looks great.

1491
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,670
Her face rendered with mine looks beautiful.

1492
00:54:57,674 --> 00:54:59,600
- She looks good with Seok Jin. - Look at mine.

1493
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:00,940
Look at mine.

1494
00:55:00,944 --> 00:55:01,940
Mine looks beautiful.

1495
00:55:01,945 --> 00:55:04,340
This one is with Jong Kook.

1496
00:55:04,347 --> 00:55:06,040
There I am.

1497
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:07,880
My face is more apparent.

1498
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:09,810
Jong Kook, your daughters would look pretty.

1499
00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:11,450
- All of yours look great. - Right.

1500
00:55:11,454 --> 00:55:13,450
Mine is great with a mustache.

1501
00:55:13,456 --> 00:55:15,750
- Haha's looks good. - Mine looks pretty.

1502
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:18,190
- Haha's always looks masculine. - No.

1503
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:19,960
- They look more masculine. - All of them do.

1504
00:55:19,963 --> 00:55:21,560
Look at the other ones. They look masculine.

1505
00:55:21,565 --> 00:55:23,190
They look so pretty.

1506
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:25,030
- It's because of the mustache. - That's right.

1507
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:26,060
It's because of the mustache.

1508
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:27,670
This looks too masculine.

1509
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:29,730
- Kwang Soo, yours is a success. - Kwang Soo's looks good.

1510
00:55:29,739 --> 00:55:30,970
- Yours is a success. - Mine looks pretty.

1511
00:55:30,974 --> 00:55:32,070
Yours is a success.

1512
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:33,570
Mine looks pretty.

1513
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:34,910
Se Chan's is...

1514
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,240
- Se Chan's is... - Kwang Soo's looks good.

1515
00:55:36,246 --> 00:55:37,810
Look at Se Chan's.

1516
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:39,180
His features are too strong.

1517
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:41,280
- They're too strong. - Right?

1518
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:42,750
His mouth is too obvious.

1519
00:55:42,752 --> 00:55:44,450
Even she can't overcome Se Chan.

1520
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:46,520
I don't know who she is, but she can't.

1521
00:55:46,523 --> 00:55:49,185
Who can overcome Se Chan's features?

1522
00:55:49,526 --> 00:55:51,390
My goodness.

1523
00:55:51,394 --> 00:55:52,990
Look at this one.

1524
00:55:52,996 --> 00:55:54,490
Mine looks okay, doesn't it?

1525
00:55:54,497 --> 00:55:56,490
- She looks good. - It isn't bad.

1526
00:55:56,499 --> 00:55:57,800
The faces look masculine.

1527
00:55:57,801 --> 00:55:59,935
She's pretty too.

1528
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:02,470
- She just needs braces. - This guest is...

1529
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:03,470
- Look at Jong Kook's. - It's okay.

1530
00:56:03,473 --> 00:56:05,500
It has Jong Kook's features.

1531
00:56:05,508 --> 00:56:07,470
Jong Kook's looks pretty.

1532
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:09,270
- It looks good. - Mine looks pretty.

1533
00:56:09,279 --> 00:56:11,140
- She looks familiar. - Mine looks pretty.

1534
00:56:11,147 --> 00:56:13,210
- This is masculine again. - It's pretty.

1535
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:14,210
It's pretty.

1536
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:16,480
It's very beautiful.

1537
00:56:16,486 --> 00:56:18,450
She's pretty without the mustache.

1538
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:21,490
Look at her eyes and her cheeks. They look amazing.

1539
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:22,820
It looks strange.

1540
00:56:22,826 --> 00:56:24,420
The second guest looks...

1541
00:56:24,427 --> 00:56:26,690
- terrible with Kwang Soo. - She takes after her father.

1542
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:28,360
- Right. - Look at the one next to it.

1543
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:29,730
Yes.

1544
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:32,260
Look at the one next to it. It's worse.

1545
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:33,670
Goodness.

1546
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,365
(Kwang Soo's is not bad at all.)

1547
00:56:36,706 --> 00:56:39,040
(The real thing appeared.)

1548
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:40,440
It's Se Chan's.

1549
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,170
- It's Se Chan's. - Mine?

1550
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:43,940
- What's wrong with you? - Really?

1551
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,380
(You're terrible.)

1552
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,510
- What did you do in your photo? - He ruins all photos.

1553
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:51,050
I feel so terrible.

1554
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:52,780
I'm getting tears.

1555
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,390
You have such strong features.

1556
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:56,120
You have nothing to say even if they sue you.

1557
00:56:56,126 --> 00:56:57,820
That's true.

1558
00:56:57,827 --> 00:57:00,590
This one is cute. Aren't these cute?

1559
00:57:00,597 --> 00:57:02,990
I blend well with other people.

1560
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:05,200
Jae Seok blends well with others.

1561
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:06,830
- It looks like an idol singer. - That's right.

1562
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:07,900
It looks like an idol singer.

1563
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,135
- Isn't this pretty? - Kwang Soo's looks good.

1564
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:11,600
- Look at Kwang Soo's. - Mine isn't bad.

1565
00:57:11,608 --> 00:57:13,270
You can tell Kwang Soo's features.

1566
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:16,510
- This is the worst. - My goodness.

1567
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:18,080
(It's the worst photo of all.)

1568
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,210
- It's Se Chan's. - It's Se Chan's again.

1569
00:57:20,216 --> 00:57:22,050
(Se Chan's is shocking and scary.)

1570
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:25,420
(How does the rendered photo look?)

1571
00:57:25,422 --> 00:57:28,650
- This is the worst. - My goodness.

1572
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,220
(It's the worst photo of all.)

1573
00:57:30,226 --> 00:57:32,360
- It's Se Chan's. - It's Se Chan's again.

1574
00:57:32,362 --> 00:57:34,190
(Se Chan's is shocking and scary.)

1575
00:57:34,197 --> 00:57:37,800
(How does the rendered photo look?)

1576
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,000
This is so funny.

1577
00:57:40,003 --> 00:57:41,400
I'm sorry.

1578
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:43,130
Mine's not too bad though.

1579
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:46,270
This is what it is. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sister.

1580
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:49,610
(1st, 2nd, and 3rd sisters are all the same.)

1581
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:50,880
(Happy sisters)

1582
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,840
We should only say good things.

1583
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:54,650
- Stop it. - He's right.

1584
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:56,610
He has strong genes.

1585
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:59,220
I think this one is the most beautiful...

1586
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:01,720
- of Se Chan's sisters. - I agree.

1587
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:03,420
She's the most beautiful.

1588
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,760
She looks good.

1589
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:06,090
- I don't think so. - She's fine.

1590
00:58:06,096 --> 00:58:08,490
What do you mean? This one's not good.

1591
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:10,730
- It's kind of... - It looks a lot like you.

1592
00:58:10,734 --> 00:58:11,930
I agree. It looks a lot like me.

1593
00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:13,330
She's pretty.

1594
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:14,430
(I'm pretty.)

1595
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:15,770
She's the prettiest.

1596
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:17,170
- She's fine. - She's the prettiest.

1597
00:58:17,173 --> 00:58:19,600
Doesn't she look kind of mean?

1598
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:20,910
- She's scary. - She's kind of scary.

1599
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:23,610
I agree. This is your first failure.

1600
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,710
- She looks violent. - This is your first failure.

1601
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,410
She looks like a good fighter.

1602
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:29,580
- Isn't this a man? - It's Jun Hyun Moo.

1603
00:58:29,586 --> 00:58:31,420
- It's a man. - It's Jun Hyun Moo.

1604
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,420
You have to agree to this.

1605
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:34,890
I agree.

1606
00:58:34,891 --> 00:58:36,520
This is Jun Hyun Moo.

1607
00:58:36,526 --> 00:58:39,320
- Kwang Soo is pretty. - She looks better.

1608
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:43,130
- The fourth one is the best. - She's pretty.

1609
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,430
Kwang Soo looks the best.

1610
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:45,930
She looks cute.

1611
00:58:45,935 --> 00:58:47,130
(This is Kwang Soo's best picture.)

1612
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:48,600
- I like this one. - It's not bad.

1613
00:58:48,605 --> 00:58:50,240
- I like it. - His is the best.

1614
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,700
Look at the last one.

1615
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,640
(Look at the last one.)

1616
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:54,970
It's Se Chan.

1617
00:58:54,978 --> 00:58:57,710
I made eye contacts with her!

1618
00:58:57,714 --> 00:58:58,710
(It's overwhelming to look at.)

1619
00:58:58,715 --> 00:59:00,550
I made eye contacts with the last picture.

1620
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:03,880
It looks too like me.

1621
00:59:03,887 --> 00:59:05,480
- This is... - There...

1622
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:07,855
There are so many other pictures.

1623
00:59:09,159 --> 00:59:13,020
(It's completely Se Chan.)

1624
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:15,030
(He refuses to get mixed with anybody else.)

1625
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:16,060
It's Se Chan.

1626
00:59:16,065 --> 00:59:18,160
(It's 1,000 percent Se Chan.)

1627
00:59:18,168 --> 00:59:21,905
This is a nightmare.

1628
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:25,040
- Look at his eyes. - This is so scary.

1629
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,600
Is she holding a deadly weapon?

1630
00:59:26,609 --> 00:59:29,040
Se Chan's genes...

1631
00:59:29,045 --> 00:59:32,010
- are so strong. - My mouth is a weapon.

1632
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:35,410
If you ask me to pick a person that suits me...

1633
00:59:35,418 --> 00:59:36,820
(It's time to choose their partners.)

1634
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:40,620
I think the first person suits me the most.

1635
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:42,420
The third person suits Se Chan.

1636
00:59:42,425 --> 00:59:43,690
This one's the best.

1637
00:59:43,693 --> 00:59:45,420
- I agree. - It's the least bad.

1638
00:59:45,428 --> 00:59:46,990
- Number three for Se Chan. - Me too.

1639
00:59:46,996 --> 00:59:48,390
- Me too. - Okay.

1640
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,130
Number three isn't bad.

1641
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:53,030
She's pretty. She's my style.

1642
00:59:53,036 --> 00:59:55,500
- This one suits you. - It's not bad.

1643
00:59:55,505 --> 00:59:56,600
- She suits you. - She's...

1644
00:59:56,606 --> 00:59:58,440
- beautiful. - Is this one good?

1645
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:00,770
- Is this one the best? - I say number two for you.

1646
01:00:00,777 --> 01:00:03,040
- I think it's the best. - I agree.

1647
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:05,340
Take the picture you like and stick it on your chest.

1648
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:07,510
- Should we? My picture? - Just our own?

1649
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:10,185
This is really...

1650
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,320
I don't know who she is,

1651
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:15,020
but she should be in a commercial for glasses.

1652
01:00:15,024 --> 01:00:17,820
Did the guests see these pictures?

1653
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:20,430
They haven't seen it yet? What should I do then?

1654
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:22,895
How do I show her this?

1655
01:00:23,333 --> 01:00:25,600
Don't do it!

1656
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:27,270
(So Min...)

1657
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,970
So Min.

1658
01:00:28,972 --> 01:00:30,765
(She sticks it on.)

1659
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:33,640
Don't do it.

1660
01:00:33,643 --> 01:00:36,875
It's so scary.

1661
01:00:37,046 --> 01:00:40,450
Don't do it! Don't squeeze me.

1662
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,780
(Both So Min and Ji Hyo pick Se Chan.)

1663
01:00:41,784 --> 01:00:42,950
- Se Chan! - This is not fair.

1664
01:00:42,952 --> 01:00:44,880
- Me too. - Yang Se Chan!

1665
01:00:44,888 --> 01:00:46,020
- Yang Se Chan! - Yang Se Chan!

1666
01:00:46,022 --> 01:00:48,690
This should be your profile picture on the internet.

1667
01:00:48,691 --> 01:00:50,720
- This is driving me nuts. - Change it for a week.

1668
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:53,560
I know. I really want this picture.

1669
01:00:53,563 --> 01:00:57,330
(Desired Partners)

1670
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,730
Let's welcome the first guest.

1671
01:00:59,736 --> 01:01:01,400
I have no idea who she is.

1672
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,870
- I wonder who she is. - I have no clue.

1673
01:01:03,873 --> 01:01:05,640
I can't tell from this picture.

1674
01:01:05,642 --> 01:01:07,440
First guest...

1675
01:01:07,443 --> 01:01:10,040
(Jae Seok's and her face were combined, but she still looks fine.)

1676
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:11,810
All her pictures looked fine.

1677
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:15,585
(Who is the first partner who looks pretty in all pictures?)

1678
01:01:16,085 --> 01:01:17,380
Han Na!

1679
01:01:17,387 --> 01:01:18,620
It was Han Na?

1680
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:21,155
(Kang Han Na is like family.)

1681
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:25,520
(She said ballet was her hobby, but she showed an old-style dance.)

1682
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,530
(On Family Project, she went around the world with Running Man.)

1683
01:01:28,531 --> 01:01:31,365
(Running Man knows her very well.)

1684
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:32,930
Kang Han Na.

1685
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:34,230
(How have you been?)

1686
01:01:34,237 --> 01:01:36,135
It's Han Na.

1687
01:01:36,172 --> 01:01:39,370
It's Han Na. I didn't know it was you.

1688
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,610
(Nice to meet you, friend.)

1689
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:44,340
- I had no idea. - Han Na.

1690
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:45,880
- How have you been? - How are you?

1691
01:01:45,882 --> 01:01:47,350
- It's been a while. - Han Na.

1692
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:49,515
Did you see these pictures?

1693
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:50,580
Look.

1694
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:53,580
- What is this? - This is you and me.

1695
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:55,720
- That one's not as bad. - I agree. Right?

1696
01:01:55,725 --> 01:01:56,990
- That one's the best. - Mine's not bad either.

1697
01:01:56,993 --> 01:01:58,620
How's this? Look at Se Chan's.

1698
01:01:58,628 --> 01:02:00,355
Se Chan.

1699
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,900
(Collapsing)

1700
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,130
- Hey... She collapsed. - She collapsed.

1701
01:02:07,136 --> 01:02:08,900
- That one's the best. - I agree.

1702
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:12,440
This might not be true,

1703
01:02:12,442 --> 01:02:16,040
but she's comparable to Han Na.

1704
01:02:16,045 --> 01:02:17,710
- She's not bad. - Is it a tie?

1705
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:19,440
Han Na looks too good.

1706
01:02:19,449 --> 01:02:21,410
The mom is too beautiful,

1707
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:23,680
so even if the dad is this bad...

1708
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:24,680
(He's correct.)

1709
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,320
"This bad"? Don't say that.

1710
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:29,320
- The result is very... - That's not nice.

1711
01:02:29,325 --> 01:02:32,120
I think the lips are mine.

1712
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:33,220
- Is it? - That's true. These are your lips.

1713
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:34,830
That's fortunate.

1714
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,430
- That's important. - If these were your lips...

1715
01:02:37,433 --> 01:02:39,600
I didn't know the lips were important.

1716
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:41,730
- It's important. - Second guest.

1717
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:43,400
Please come on out.

1718
01:02:43,406 --> 01:02:45,040
- Jong Kook and Haha. - Number two.

1719
01:02:45,041 --> 01:02:46,170
- Jong Kook and Haha. - Who is it?

1720
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:47,940
- Who is it? It's me. - Who has number two?

1721
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:50,040
- Number two. - Me.

1722
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:55,045
(She looks rather sophisticated. Who is the guest?)

1723
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:56,810
(Seol In A, master of breakdance freezes)

1724
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:57,920
It's In A.

1725
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,320
(Seol In A, master of breakdance freezes)

1726
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:03,390
(She made a mark with her sophisticated dance.)

1727
01:03:03,393 --> 01:03:07,490
(She was the first female guest to show off a freeze.)

1728
01:03:07,497 --> 01:03:11,630
(She showed great teamwork with Haha. They're happy to have her.)

1729
01:03:11,634 --> 01:03:13,530
In A. Gosh, In A.

1730
01:03:13,536 --> 01:03:14,700
- Is it you? - It's me.

1731
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:18,070
This is amazing. You should grow a mustache.

1732
01:03:18,074 --> 01:03:20,235
This is amazing.

1733
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:22,440
- He stole her. - Have you been well?

1734
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:24,415
Jong Kook is awkward.

1735
01:03:24,781 --> 01:03:28,510
(In A, I chose you too.)

1736
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:29,550
- Okay. - He stole her.

1737
01:03:29,552 --> 01:03:31,820
- Okay! - "Okay".

1738
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:34,250
- Jong Kook is mad. - Don't be.

1739
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:35,950
(He's scared.)

1740
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:37,420
Okay.

1741
01:03:37,427 --> 01:03:38,990
- It's okay. I'm fine. - Don't feel bad.

1742
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:41,160
- It's okay. I'm fine. - Let it go.

1743
01:03:41,164 --> 01:03:43,330
- Come here, In A. - Hello, In A.

1744
01:03:43,332 --> 01:03:45,960
You must be busy with a drama. How did you come?

1745
01:03:45,968 --> 01:03:47,830
It's over now.

1746
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,970
- No wonder. - I missed Running Man, so I'm here.

1747
01:03:49,972 --> 01:03:51,070
Right.

1748
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:54,540
(There's tension. In A's partner will be revealed shortly.)

1749
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,610
Third guest, come on out.

1750
01:03:56,612 --> 01:03:59,540
- Third guest. - I don't know who this is.

1751
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:01,750
- I looked at the face and knew. - Who is it?

1752
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:02,750
Who is it?

1753
01:04:02,752 --> 01:04:06,450
(Seok Jin and Se Chan chose this partner but it's hard to tell.)

1754
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:09,355
(The third guest is...)

1755
01:04:09,725 --> 01:04:12,125
Irene!

1756
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:15,590
(This is her 4th time on the show. She's always beautiful.)

1757
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:19,730
(She's a cute partner here rather than a charismatic leader.)

1758
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,365
Irene!

1759
01:04:21,404 --> 01:04:23,270
Irene. Come on.

1760
01:04:23,272 --> 01:04:26,000
It was Irene? No wonder the picture came out good.

1761
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:28,440
- Goodness. - It was Irene.

1762
01:04:28,444 --> 01:04:30,805
- Irene. - Irene, come here.

1763
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:32,480
What's that?

1764
01:04:32,482 --> 01:04:34,850
(Are you shocked?)

1765
01:04:34,851 --> 01:04:37,185
It's been a long time.

1766
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:38,480
(She's petrified.)

1767
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:41,585
Irene, look at this.

1768
01:04:42,191 --> 01:04:45,890
She couldn't overcome this.

1769
01:04:45,895 --> 01:04:47,130
(Would you like to be my partner?)

1770
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:48,925
No way.

1771
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:50,230
You don't want to?

1772
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,530
Look at the other guys. This one's the best.

1773
01:04:52,535 --> 01:04:54,430
This one's not bad.

1774
01:04:54,437 --> 01:04:55,730
This is Jun Hyun Moo.

1775
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:56,730
(Haha plus Irene)

1776
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:57,770
This is Jun Hyun Moo.

1777
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:59,240
(It's a familiar face.)

1778
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:00,340
Mine is the prettiest.

1779
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:01,940
Irene and...

1780
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:04,540
- It was her. - She couldn't overcome this.

1781
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:05,810
(Who will be Irene's ugly partner?)

1782
01:05:05,815 --> 01:05:08,080
Last guest.

1783
01:05:08,084 --> 01:05:10,480
- Last one. - Let's welcome her.

1784
01:05:10,486 --> 01:05:12,020
I'm curious. Who is it?

1785
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:13,580
(She didn't look too bad when combined with Kwang Soo.)

1786
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:14,790
Come on out.

1787
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,890
(Who is this guest?)

1788
01:05:16,893 --> 01:05:19,390
Who is it? It's Joy.

1789
01:05:19,395 --> 01:05:21,225
(Joy is Kwang Soo's ex-girlfriend on variety shows.)

1790
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:27,000
(Her first ever partner on TV was Kwang Soo unfortunately.)

1791
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:32,140
(With her slapping dance, she shook Kwang Soo's heart.)

1792
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:33,270
It's Joy.

1793
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:34,640
(He welcomes her.)

1794
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,410
Right.

1795
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:39,015
Look, Joy.

1796
01:05:39,081 --> 01:05:40,910
(How have you all been?)

1797
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:42,750
- Look. - Oh, dear.

1798
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,920
- I'm sorry, Joy. - Look at Se Chan.

1799
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:47,790
(I'm doing well. Long time, no see.)

1800
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,950
(I'm sorry for welcoming you like this.)

1801
01:05:49,959 --> 01:05:53,060
She's the best out of Se Chan's pictures.

1802
01:05:53,062 --> 01:05:54,090
Doesn't she look like a good fighter?

1803
01:05:54,096 --> 01:05:56,990
She looks like a school bully.

1804
01:05:56,999 --> 01:05:58,130
I'm really sorry.

1805
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:00,130
- Is this combined with me? - Yes, I'm sorry.

1806
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:03,130
(The effect of strong genes on future generations)

1807
01:06:03,139 --> 01:06:07,610
So we have Han Na, In A, Irene, and Joy.

1808
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:08,810
(Welcome, our friends.)

1809
01:06:08,811 --> 01:06:10,370
Come on.

1810
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:12,080
- What was that? - Let's go!

1811
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:15,280
Today's guests are like family.

1812
01:06:15,284 --> 01:06:17,320
- Right. It's nice seeing them. - They've been here many times.

1813
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,750
We've seen them many times.

1814
01:06:18,754 --> 01:06:20,590
As for Han Na...

1815
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:22,720
- We went abroad with her. - Right.

1816
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:25,220
Running Man helped...

1817
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:27,290
- Han Na become famous. - That's true.

1818
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:28,990
Running Man raised Han Na.

1819
01:06:28,998 --> 01:06:30,060
We raised her.

1820
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,900
- On Running Man... - Through Running Man,

1821
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,930
- we produced many stars. - That's true.

1822
01:06:33,936 --> 01:06:34,930
In A.

1823
01:06:34,937 --> 01:06:36,900
- In A as well. - In A!

1824
01:06:36,906 --> 01:06:38,370
According to your manager,

1825
01:06:38,374 --> 01:06:39,840
you were envious of Da Hee...

1826
01:06:39,842 --> 01:06:42,170
- when she joined Family Project. - Yes.

1827
01:06:42,178 --> 01:06:43,540
I was so envious of her. We came on the show together.

1828
01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,040
They came to Jeju Island together.

1829
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:46,975
(She was envious of Da Hee.)

1830
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:50,310
(They were both guests on Couple Race in January.)

1831
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:53,180
(In A dominated the dance stage, and Da Hee stole it from her.)

1832
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:55,850
- Good job! - What is she doing?

1833
01:06:55,858 --> 01:06:58,520
(How do you beat that?)

1834
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:00,320
Da Hee even tied her hair up.

1835
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:01,860
- She did that. - Before Da Hee came on the stage,

1836
01:07:01,864 --> 01:07:03,960
- In A was dominating it. - That's right.

1837
01:07:03,966 --> 01:07:06,630
- She did hip hop. - It was sophisticated.

1838
01:07:06,636 --> 01:07:09,170
In A, since you are here, can you show us the freeze?

1839
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:10,940
(Would you like to redeem yourself?)

1840
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,840
- Should I? - Fur freeze.

1841
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:14,010
- Fur freeze. - Can you do it?

1842
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,510
- What's "fur freeze"? - Can you do it?

1843
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:16,810
Look at her.

1844
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:18,140
She can do it.

1845
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:20,210
Goodness.

1846
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:21,780
She can do it.

1847
01:07:21,784 --> 01:07:26,415
(Are you watching, Da Hee? This is the fur freeze!)

1848
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,750
- She's amazing. - Look at her.

1849
01:07:28,758 --> 01:07:30,820
- She's incredible. - She's great.

1850
01:07:30,826 --> 01:07:32,620
- This is great. - You're great.

1851
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:33,660
You're incredible.

1852
01:07:33,663 --> 01:07:35,160
That was good. And then...

1853
01:07:35,164 --> 01:07:37,530
- Irene. - You two must be busy.

1854
01:07:37,533 --> 01:07:38,660
Thanks for joining us.

1855
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:41,235
Congratulations on receiving an award.

1856
01:07:41,637 --> 01:07:44,470
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1857
01:07:44,473 --> 01:07:46,300
- They recently received an award. - It's good news.

1858
01:07:46,309 --> 01:07:47,970
You both received the award.

1859
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:49,510
Are you releasing a new song?

1860
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,040
- Yes. - Yes, we are.

1861
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:53,010
- Is it a new song after "Power Up"? - Yes.

1862
01:07:53,015 --> 01:07:54,780
We have to see it.

1863
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:56,380
- Really? - Show us.

1864
01:07:56,385 --> 01:07:58,620
- There they go. - It hasn't been released yet.

1865
01:07:58,621 --> 01:08:00,690
- This is the initial release. - We're the first ones hearing it.

1866
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:01,950
This is the very first time.

1867
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:05,120
("Really Bad Boy" by Red Velvet gets revealed for the first time.)

1868
01:08:05,127 --> 01:08:06,120
(Skipping)

1869
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:07,290
Red Velvet's highlight move.

1870
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:10,130
(Sophisticated and cute)

1871
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:11,930
This is the highlight.

1872
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,530
(Red Velvet's highlight moves are always addictive.)

1873
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,070
It's easy to follow.

1874
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:18,070
(It's addictive and sexy on top of that!)

1875
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:21,140
(It's provocative.)

1876
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,740
(It makes their hearts pound.)

1877
01:08:23,746 --> 01:08:25,815
It goes like this.

1878
01:08:26,882 --> 01:08:30,050
(They're sexy and mature. This is the upgraded Red Velvet.)

1879
01:08:30,052 --> 01:08:31,380
- This is it. - This will be popular.

1880
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:33,885
This is it.

1881
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:36,550
My gosh.

1882
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:39,120
- That was so good. - It's a great song.

1883
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:40,460
That was a great song.

1884
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:41,560
We have to...

1885
01:08:41,564 --> 01:08:42,960
choose the partners.

1886
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,430
By the way, Ji Hyo and So Min...

1887
01:08:44,433 --> 01:08:46,030
are not saying a word.

1888
01:08:46,035 --> 01:08:49,170
(There are no male guests.)

1889
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:50,500
They didn't say a single word.

1890
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:53,870
(Was it too obvious? Were we too quiet?)

1891
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:59,545
(When everybody was excited looking at the pictures...)

1892
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:03,080
(During the dance time...)

1893
01:09:03,085 --> 01:09:06,820
(Clapping)

1894
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:10,150
Are you doing this because there are no male guests?

1895
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:13,795
We can pick the person we want to be partners with, right?

1896
01:09:13,896 --> 01:09:16,630
(What? You are going to choose one of us?)

1897
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:20,400
(They're in trouble.)

1898
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:21,970
Doesn't that go against the rules?

1899
01:09:21,971 --> 01:09:23,630
Shouldn't we receive a penalty for that?

1900
01:09:23,639 --> 01:09:24,940
(He's totally against it.)

1901
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,440
But that's more work.

1902
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,740
Let us...

1903
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:30,540
Let us choose too.

1904
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:32,440
(Don't disturb us.)

1905
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,810
You can, but this complicates things.

1906
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:37,380
Let us do it this way just for this week.

1907
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,480
- You want to ruin everything. - She's mad.

1908
01:09:39,488 --> 01:09:41,950
- We'll now choose the partners. - Okay.

1909
01:09:41,957 --> 01:09:43,120
First of all,

1910
01:09:43,125 --> 01:09:45,620
- Han Na will choose her partner. - Han Na.

1911
01:09:45,628 --> 01:09:46,620
Han Na,

1912
01:09:46,629 --> 01:09:48,030
I have your picture.

1913
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,960
I'm already here.

1914
01:09:49,965 --> 01:09:51,860
I have so many great memories...

1915
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:54,730
- with Han Na from Switzerland. - That's true.

1916
01:09:54,737 --> 01:09:57,705
Do you remember the suspension bridge?

1917
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:00,970
(Haha and Han Na had to cross the longest suspension bridge...)

1918
01:10:00,976 --> 01:10:04,070
(during Family Project.)

1919
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:06,180
(Laugh, Han Na.)

1920
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,210
(She's happy.)

1921
01:10:08,217 --> 01:10:11,050
(They completed the mission thanks to Han Na's laugh.)

1922
01:10:11,053 --> 01:10:13,550
- If it weren't for you... - I almost teared up.

1923
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:14,690
Do you have anything special with Se Chan?

1924
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:15,850
We ate together.

1925
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:17,685
- In the train. - Train, right.

1926
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:19,060
- Do you dislike me that much? - No.

1927
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:21,225
- Did you erase that memory? - That's not why.

1928
01:10:21,363 --> 01:10:25,030
(They ate together for a short time on Swiss Alpine Train.)

1929
01:10:25,034 --> 01:10:27,400
(Can we order some kimchi too?)

1930
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:30,840
(They shared some jokes, but it wasn't anything special.)

1931
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,970
That's not why. We ate together.

1932
01:10:32,975 --> 01:10:34,970
- Do you have anything? - We were a couple for a moment.

1933
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,410
- Is that true? - We were.

1934
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:37,610
- We were. - When was that?

1935
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:38,980
Didn't we have to buy something?

1936
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:40,740
- Oh, right. - You... Hold on.

1937
01:10:40,749 --> 01:10:42,080
- What's this? - The sheep costume.

1938
01:10:42,084 --> 01:10:43,280
Black face and sheep costume.

1939
01:10:43,285 --> 01:10:44,280
- We were a couple for a short time. - Right.

1940
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:45,480
You should remember...

1941
01:10:45,488 --> 01:10:47,950
that In A is by your side right now.

1942
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:49,020
Well...

1943
01:10:49,024 --> 01:10:51,190
I just thought it was my turn to...

1944
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:53,390
- I thought he picked me. - He didn't.

1945
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:54,690
But...

1946
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:57,260
I'm more popular than I thought. I was worried.

1947
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:58,330
- I'm surprised. - Of course.

1948
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:00,500
- Of course, Han Na. - We all love you.

1949
01:11:00,503 --> 01:11:02,800
I thought there would be nobody, so I wasn't sure what to do.

1950
01:11:02,805 --> 01:11:05,040
You can say something if you want, Kwang Soo.

1951
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,140
I like you for real.

1952
01:11:06,141 --> 01:11:09,910
(Let me say something.)

1953
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:11,580
- This is a confession. - Your hair...

1954
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,740
- is long in the back. - It is, right?

1955
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:15,950
Your pants are kind of short.

1956
01:11:15,951 --> 01:11:17,950
- It's nice. - They're short.

1957
01:11:17,953 --> 01:11:20,320
- I know who I want to be with. - Who is it?

1958
01:11:20,322 --> 01:11:22,650
No way. Think carefully.

1959
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:24,590
(She has more candidates than expected. Who will she choose?)

1960
01:11:24,593 --> 01:11:26,820
(Original candidate is Jae Seok.)

1961
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:29,590
(Haha has many memories with her.)

1962
01:11:29,598 --> 01:11:31,900
(Se Chan was forgotten.)

1963
01:11:31,901 --> 01:11:34,000
(Jong Kook was also forgotten.)

1964
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:36,770
(Kwang Soo really likes her.)

1965
01:11:36,772 --> 01:11:38,140
2, 3.

1966
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:39,170
(Who does she have in mind?)

1967
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,840
- Kim Jong Kook! - My gosh.

1968
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:42,310
(She makes an unexpected choice.)

1969
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:44,440
- That was bad. - Really?

1970
01:11:44,446 --> 01:11:46,280
- Why him? Why? - All of a sudden?

1971
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:47,610
Now Jae Seok looks silly.

1972
01:11:47,616 --> 01:11:49,380
I'm speechless.

1973
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:51,920
Go away! Go away.

1974
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:54,350
(He's treated coldly.)

1975
01:11:54,356 --> 01:11:55,620
- No way. - In A.

1976
01:11:55,624 --> 01:11:56,850
- Okay! - Right.

1977
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:58,890
What is this?

1978
01:11:58,894 --> 01:12:01,060
(She returns Han Na's picture.)

1979
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:03,630
(He switches to In A's picture right next to it.)

1980
01:12:03,632 --> 01:12:06,330
In A! In A!

1981
01:12:06,335 --> 01:12:07,500
Seol In A!

1982
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:09,100
We can object, right?

1983
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:10,230
We can object.

1984
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,900
Let's see if anybody has objections.

1985
01:12:11,907 --> 01:12:14,000
Who wants to be partners with Jong Kook?

1986
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:15,140
Me!

1987
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,610
(In A objects.)

1988
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:18,910
Oh, dear.

1989
01:12:18,914 --> 01:12:20,410
(Jong Kook and Han Na are confused.)

1990
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:23,445
What's this?

1991
01:12:23,452 --> 01:12:25,615
What does this mean to you?

1992
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:28,050
- What are you doing to Haha? - What is this?

1993
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:29,220
(What? I thought we were almost partners.)

1994
01:12:29,224 --> 01:12:30,985
(He's bitter.)

1995
01:12:31,527 --> 01:12:33,795
Fine. I don't need In A.

1996
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:35,030
(He returns it right away.)

1997
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,090
No.

1998
01:12:36,098 --> 01:12:37,130
You can't do that.

1999
01:12:37,132 --> 01:12:38,430
- Irene. - What are you doing?

2000
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:40,600
- Irene. - Hey. What's wrong with you?

2001
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:42,030
- What are you doing? - Move.

2002
01:12:42,037 --> 01:12:43,470
- What are you doing? - Hey.

2003
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:44,640
- Go away. - Hey.

2004
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,200
- Look at this, Irene. - Move.

2005
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,740
Look at this.

2006
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:48,970
Look.

2007
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:51,210
(That doesn't look too nice.)

2008
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:52,340
Isn't it so charming?

2009
01:12:52,348 --> 01:12:54,575
She can go to South America.

2010
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:56,510
This is a mess.

2011
01:12:56,518 --> 01:12:58,385
There's no sense of loyalty.

2012
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,820
Then, with In A...

2013
01:13:00,823 --> 01:13:01,850
(Hold on!)

2014
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:04,890
What's this?

2015
01:13:04,893 --> 01:13:07,425
Do you want to be partners with Jong Kook?

2016
01:13:07,596 --> 01:13:09,190
- Yes. - Yes.

2017
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:10,660
(They object to Jong Kook and Han Na being a couple.)

2018
01:13:10,666 --> 01:13:12,430
Stop it, you guys.

2019
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:14,000
- Honey! - Hey.

2020
01:13:14,003 --> 01:13:15,570
(I'm here, honey!)

2021
01:13:15,571 --> 01:13:16,900
Hey!

2022
01:13:16,905 --> 01:13:19,605
She called him "honey". This is no joke.

2023
01:13:19,642 --> 01:13:21,210
- Don't split us apart. - Honey.

2024
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:23,770
- I'm going to break your arm. - Honey...

2025
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:25,780
- Darling! - Go away.

2026
01:13:25,781 --> 01:13:27,510
- Darling... Darling! - Stop it!

2027
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:29,745
- You guys! - This is a freeze for you, honey.

2028
01:13:30,052 --> 01:13:31,420
- No, no. - This is nice.

2029
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:32,620
What a mess.

2030
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,485
- Freeze? - This is good.

2031
01:13:34,523 --> 01:13:36,420
- Oh, dear. - Then Jong Kook.

2032
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:38,160
- You need to decide. Han Na, - Do I?

2033
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,890
- In A, So Min, and Ji Hyo. - I'm in trouble.

2034
01:13:39,895 --> 01:13:42,530
Jong Kook is popular.

2035
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:44,230
I didn't know this would happen.

2036
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:46,600
If I become partners with you, I can live with this face.

2037
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:48,330
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

2038
01:13:48,337 --> 01:13:49,430
(She's very serious.)

2039
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:52,100
I didn't even imagine this.

2040
01:13:52,107 --> 01:13:53,100
For now,

2041
01:13:53,108 --> 01:13:55,570
you can say which ladies should leave.

2042
01:13:55,577 --> 01:13:56,810
- Those who can leave? - Yes.

2043
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,880
Go, you two.

2044
01:13:59,882 --> 01:14:01,310
- Why, darling? - Stop it.

2045
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,610
- Why, darling? Let's talk later. - Stop fooling around.

2046
01:14:03,619 --> 01:14:05,250
- Look at those two. - Then...

2047
01:14:05,254 --> 01:14:07,220
- choose between Han Na and In A. - Oh, gosh.

2048
01:14:07,222 --> 01:14:09,220
(Jong Kook's avid fans are left.)

2049
01:14:09,224 --> 01:14:10,350
What do I do?

2050
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:11,820
(He's deep in thought.)

2051
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:14,090
I have an acrostic poem for Jong Kook.

2052
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:15,760
- Do you want to tell us? - All of a sudden?

2053
01:14:15,764 --> 01:14:17,630
- An acrostic poem. - What? Really?

2054
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm so thankful.

2055
01:14:20,002 --> 01:14:21,530
I'll stand next to Jong Kook and recite it.

2056
01:14:21,537 --> 01:14:23,600
- Okay. This is awesome. - She wasn't like this before.

2057
01:14:23,605 --> 01:14:24,640
(She's anxious.)

2058
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,700
- Let's watch. - "Kim".

2059
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:27,975
- It's an acrostic poem. - Yes, "Kim".

2060
01:14:28,544 --> 01:14:30,040
This is fogging up.

2061
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:31,880
(She wipes it away.)

2062
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:33,540
(Why is it fogging up?)

2063
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:35,485
"Jong".

2064
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:37,610
Is it because of Jong Kook's warmth?

2065
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:40,580
(She gets close to him.)

2066
01:14:40,589 --> 01:14:43,190
(I'm a warm person.)

2067
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,250
(What's going on?)

2068
01:14:44,259 --> 01:14:45,720
- "Kook". - Oh, dear.

2069
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:46,720
"Kook".

2070
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:48,595
Cute.

2071
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,230
(Jong Kook, would you be partners with me?)

2072
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:52,530
(He's dizzy.)

2073
01:14:52,534 --> 01:14:53,600
Hold on.

2074
01:14:53,602 --> 01:14:55,200
Why aren't you looking at me? I'm trying to be cute.

2075
01:14:55,204 --> 01:14:57,470
That's not why.

2076
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:59,100
Me too.

2077
01:14:59,108 --> 01:15:00,440
- Me too. - That's not why.

2078
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:01,610
(Han Na wants to do an acrostic poem too.)

2079
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,070
- Me too. - Do you want to do one?

2080
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:05,110
I think I can do it too.

2081
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:06,580
Really? Han Na?

2082
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:07,750
(Han Na as well?)

2083
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,710
Han Na has something.

2084
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,720
"Kim".

2085
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:12,920
(Kim)

2086
01:15:12,921 --> 01:15:15,950
You put on long pants, Jong Kook.

2087
01:15:15,958 --> 01:15:18,360
(She noticed it.)

2088
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:20,620
- Yes, you're right. - Han Na.

2089
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:23,030
- Can you hurry up? There's no time. - Okay.

2090
01:15:23,031 --> 01:15:24,930
I'm taking long.

2091
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:27,100
- "Jong". - "Jong".

2092
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:30,470
Do you want to have chicken soup in Jongno?

2093
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:31,900
(I do like chicken.)

2094
01:15:31,907 --> 01:15:33,240
- Jongno. - I see.

2095
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:34,910
- I don't really go there. - "Kook".

2096
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:35,970
"Kook".

2097
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,605
(She acts cute.)

2098
01:15:38,113 --> 01:15:41,150
(This disarms everything.)

2099
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:43,710
(Han Na's cuteness disarms Jong Kook.)

2100
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:45,350
She did it.

2101
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,280
- Her cuteness worked. - This is driving me nuts.

2102
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,425
(Wiping)

2103
01:15:49,758 --> 01:15:52,120
(She can't lose!)

2104
01:15:52,127 --> 01:15:53,960
- This is fogging up. - "This is fogging up."

2105
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:56,130
- Jong Kook. - Oh, dear.

2106
01:15:56,131 --> 01:15:57,160
(Of course I remember.)

2107
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,800
Is Jong Kook that good?

2108
01:15:58,801 --> 01:16:00,700
- What's his charm? - Why are there so many?

2109
01:16:00,702 --> 01:16:03,570
- Ji Hyo. - We can't win, So Min.

2110
01:16:03,572 --> 01:16:06,100
Goodness. Oh, my.

2111
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:07,200
I'm in trouble.

2112
01:16:07,209 --> 01:16:08,570
- What should I do? - You must be happy.

2113
01:16:08,577 --> 01:16:11,180
I haven't done this since "X Man".

2114
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,080
- I have to choose. - All right, Jong Kook.

2115
01:16:13,081 --> 01:16:14,210
I'm in trouble.

2116
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:15,250
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

2117
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,510
- Do this. - Do this.

2118
01:16:17,519 --> 01:16:18,980
(Why don't you show us the legendary ear covering gesture?)

2119
01:16:18,987 --> 01:16:20,150
Hold on.

2120
01:16:20,155 --> 01:16:21,750
I can't do that. I should stop doing it.

2121
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:23,150
(It's a legend in the history of variety shows.)

2122
01:16:23,158 --> 01:16:26,590
(He covered her ears so that she doesn't have to hear sad words.)

2123
01:16:26,595 --> 01:16:29,165
- We will see it in real life. - Seriously.

2124
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:30,930
(They focus their attention on him.)

2125
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:32,230
I want to keep this video.

2126
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:33,960
I am curious about it.

2127
01:16:33,969 --> 01:16:35,400
Let's go.

2128
01:16:35,404 --> 01:16:37,970
- In 1, 2. - Gaze at them in a romantic way.

2129
01:16:37,973 --> 01:16:39,300
- Two. - Please.

2130
01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,035
(The one whose ears get covered loses.)

2131
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:42,270
Three.

2132
01:16:42,277 --> 01:16:45,575
(Whom did Jong Kook's heart decide?)

2133
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:50,845
(Cute versus Funny)

2134
01:16:50,919 --> 01:16:52,450
(I am sorry.)

2135
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:53,620
Go.

2136
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:55,285
(Go, Han Na.)

2137
01:16:55,357 --> 01:16:56,550
(Does this mean I lost again?)

2138
01:16:56,558 --> 01:16:57,920
Han Na!

2139
01:16:57,926 --> 01:16:58,960
The winner!

2140
01:16:58,961 --> 01:17:00,460
Okay!

2141
01:17:00,462 --> 01:17:02,030
(Jong Kook and In A become a couple.)

2142
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,630
Han Na, go over there.

2143
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:04,700
Go over there.

2144
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,800
- Come here. - She humiliated herself.

2145
01:17:06,802 --> 01:17:08,400
- You belong here with us. - It's not like that.

2146
01:17:08,403 --> 01:17:10,470
I missed Ji Hyo, but she was too far.

2147
01:17:10,472 --> 01:17:11,640
That's why I came here.

2148
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,000
Is this final?

2149
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:14,875
- It's over. - No way.

2150
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,310
What is Haha going to do?

2151
01:17:16,311 --> 01:17:17,880
(He returns In A's picture.)

2152
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,775
Am I making the right choice?

2153
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:22,650
(He picks Han Na since there is a higher chance.)

2154
01:17:22,651 --> 01:17:23,950
- Now, - All right.

2155
01:17:23,952 --> 01:17:25,820
it's Irene's turn.

2156
01:17:25,821 --> 01:17:27,520
Irene.

2157
01:17:27,522 --> 01:17:29,350
- Jae Seok. - Yes?

2158
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:31,690
- I know your weakness. - What is it?

2159
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:32,920
(Hold on.)

2160
01:17:32,928 --> 01:17:35,060
(Joy suddenly reveals that she knows Jae Seok's weakness.)

2161
01:17:35,063 --> 01:17:36,460
- What is it? - What weakness?

2162
01:17:36,465 --> 01:17:37,790
(Can it shake his position as the national MC?)

2163
01:17:37,799 --> 01:17:40,365
I know your weakness from 10 years ago.

2164
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:41,600
What is it?

2165
01:17:41,603 --> 01:17:43,430
(Is it a bluff or a truth?)

2166
01:17:43,438 --> 01:17:44,570
What weakness?

2167
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:46,870
Whether I reveal it or not depends on whom you choose.

2168
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,840
- What? - What weakness?

2169
01:17:48,844 --> 01:17:50,010
Is that a threat?

2170
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:51,980
I have my eyes set on Jae Seok.

2171
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:53,710
(It is a threat.)

2172
01:17:53,715 --> 01:17:54,910
- Really? - Yes.

2173
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,310
(Kwang Soo throws Joy's picture.)

2174
01:17:56,318 --> 01:17:58,815
(Then I promise I won't have my eyes on you.)

2175
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,120
(I am the one who picked you first.)

2176
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:01,890
- What was that? - My goodness.

2177
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:04,190
(Joy's revelation makes the competition fiercer.)

2178
01:18:04,192 --> 01:18:05,190
What was that?

2179
01:18:05,193 --> 01:18:06,890
This is fiercer than I expected.

2180
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:08,890
On Running Man,

2181
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:11,160
Kwang Soo is your love interest.

2182
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:15,235
He feels a bit like an ex-boyfriend.

2183
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:18,240
(Kwang Soo is Joy's ex-boyfriend on a variety show.)

2184
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,570
Nothing ever happened!

2185
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:22,210
(Be well. Don't get sick.)

2186
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,470
- Joy. - Yes?

2187
01:18:23,478 --> 01:18:25,210
In that case...

2188
01:18:25,213 --> 01:18:26,340
What are you doing?

2189
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:28,210
(He returns Irene's picture.)

2190
01:18:28,216 --> 01:18:30,550
- Joy. - Now...

2191
01:18:30,552 --> 01:18:32,950
Joy! Joy! Joy!

2192
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:34,850
What is wrong with you?

2193
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:36,650
Joy! Joy!

2194
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:39,920
(One man silently changes a picture.)

2195
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:43,190
(Joy, have a good life.)

2196
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:45,460
Joy is my pick.

2197
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:48,465
- Irene will choose first. - Irene.

2198
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,100
Didn't you have Irene's picture?

2199
01:18:50,105 --> 01:18:52,900
- He is like that. - I switched to Joy's picture.

2200
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:54,540
We can choose freely.

2201
01:18:54,543 --> 01:18:56,040
Pick Irene's picture for now.

2202
01:18:56,044 --> 01:18:57,370
Bring Irene's picture.

2203
01:18:57,379 --> 01:18:59,980
- I will... - He is so fickle.

2204
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:01,240
You never know.

2205
01:19:01,249 --> 01:19:03,480
- Then I will reveal your weakness. - All right.

2206
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:04,880
(That's not good.)

2207
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,280
What's the weakness?

2208
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:08,350
What is it?

2209
01:19:08,357 --> 01:19:10,620
- Does he have a weakness? - What's my weakness?

2210
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:11,790
I want to know.

2211
01:19:11,793 --> 01:19:13,520
What is up with her? She visits the show and says...

2212
01:19:13,528 --> 01:19:15,090
she knows my weakness.

2213
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:16,190
Come.

2214
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:18,460
(Do you want to know?)

2215
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,960
(She reveals it to Jae Seok.)

2216
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:23,530
Running Man only knows one weakness of his.

2217
01:19:23,538 --> 01:19:24,800
What is it? Can't you tell us?

2218
01:19:24,806 --> 01:19:26,740
(Will Joy be able to become Jae Seok's partner?)

2219
01:19:26,742 --> 01:19:28,940
(Hold on.)

2220
01:19:28,944 --> 01:19:30,410
It's not a secret.

2221
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:31,640
- Isn't it a secret? - No.

2222
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:34,810
I heard it from someone who is closely related to this.

2223
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:36,745
- Really? - Yes.

2224
01:19:36,818 --> 01:19:37,950
It's not a secret.

2225
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:40,580
- What is it? - I had pimples 10 years ago.

2226
01:19:40,589 --> 01:19:42,550
(I am sure everyone knows this.)

2227
01:19:42,557 --> 01:19:44,990
- It's not a secret. - What was that?

2228
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:45,990
What was that?

2229
01:19:45,994 --> 01:19:47,460
It's not much of a weakness.

2230
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:49,030
Did I get dumped because of pimples?

2231
01:19:49,031 --> 01:19:50,490
Irene!

2232
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:52,200
No, no.

2233
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:53,360
Irene!

2234
01:19:53,368 --> 01:19:55,470
- No. - I had pimples as well.

2235
01:19:55,470 --> 01:19:58,140
Se Chan still has pimples.

2236
01:19:58,140 --> 01:19:59,500
Don't get me into this!

2237
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,700
- Right now, - What is going on?

2238
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,910
we exchanged a lot of words.

2239
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,610
The only couple is Jong Kook and In A.

2240
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,710
- Irene! - Irene! Irene!

2241
01:20:08,717 --> 01:20:10,110
(They suddenly form Irene's fan club.)

2242
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:11,650
- I never strayed. - Irene!

2243
01:20:11,653 --> 01:20:13,950
Everyone brought a picture, right?

2244
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:15,620
- Yes. - Everyone brought a picture.

2245
01:20:15,624 --> 01:20:17,390
- Irene! - Give me a chance.

2246
01:20:17,392 --> 01:20:19,660
Make a three-line poem about Irene.

2247
01:20:19,661 --> 01:20:21,530
(Show your charms with a three-line poem, okay?)

2248
01:20:21,530 --> 01:20:22,660
The first line.

2249
01:20:22,664 --> 01:20:25,435
(Se Chan promotes himself first.)

2250
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:26,560
The first line.

2251
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:29,335
What a picture!

2252
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:31,800
(She is satisfied so far.)

2253
01:20:31,807 --> 01:20:32,840
The second line.

2254
01:20:32,841 --> 01:20:34,500
Irene, I will let you sleep at someplace warm.

2255
01:20:34,509 --> 01:20:36,875
- The third line. - Rinnai.

2256
01:20:37,212 --> 01:20:39,740
(He mentions a heater company.)

2257
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,110
That was great.

2258
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:43,180
(Se Chan is the best.)

2259
01:20:43,185 --> 01:20:45,550
Yang Se Chan!

2260
01:20:45,554 --> 01:20:47,580
- That was funny. - Good job.

2261
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:49,220
- I'm sorry, Irene. - Yang Se Chan.

2262
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:51,225
That was the best.

2263
01:20:51,793 --> 01:20:53,120
(He is number 1 in my heart so far.)

2264
01:20:53,128 --> 01:20:54,790
- It was the best. It was funny. - It was the best.

2265
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:55,890
It was the best.

2266
01:20:55,897 --> 01:20:57,190
Rinnai.

2267
01:20:57,199 --> 01:20:59,030
The first line.

2268
01:20:59,034 --> 01:21:01,300
(Why did he have to do so well?)

2269
01:21:01,303 --> 01:21:02,370
Anything else will be the same.

2270
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:03,830
- Middle-aged man. - "Middle-aged man."

2271
01:21:03,839 --> 01:21:06,140
(What is he going to say?)

2272
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:07,900
- The second line. - Stop now.

2273
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:08,970
The third line.

2274
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:14,580
(The poem was ordinary so far. What will the last line be?)

2275
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,945
- The third line. - Rinnai.

2276
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:19,020
(He plagiarizes Se Chan's poem right away.)

2277
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,520
It's hard.

2278
01:21:20,522 --> 01:21:22,890
(Although he plagiarized, it was funny.)

2279
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:24,290
It's hard.

2280
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:26,160
- It's hard. - Go to the end.

2281
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,630
You should show Irene how much you love her...

2282
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:30,130
with a three-line poem.

2283
01:21:30,132 --> 01:21:32,395
The first line.

2284
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:34,400
- Let's go, stingray! - All right.

2285
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:36,570
Go back in the line.

2286
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:38,340
(After the first line,)

2287
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,670
(Haha gets eliminated.)

2288
01:21:40,675 --> 01:21:43,140
That phrase is too old.

2289
01:21:43,145 --> 01:21:44,740
I haven't heard that phrase in a long while.

2290
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:47,540
Irene wouldn't even know the phrase.

2291
01:21:47,549 --> 01:21:49,410
The first line.

2292
01:21:49,417 --> 01:21:50,850
I am your dad's friend.

2293
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:52,020
Go to the end of the line.

2294
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,550
(There is no need to hear more.)

2295
01:21:53,555 --> 01:21:54,550
(He gets eliminated since the poem is too realistic.)

2296
01:21:54,556 --> 01:21:55,550
What was that?

2297
01:21:55,557 --> 01:21:56,720
Go to the end.

2298
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:57,750
What?

2299
01:21:57,759 --> 01:21:58,990
Why would you say that?

2300
01:21:58,994 --> 01:22:00,120
She is laughing.

2301
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:02,525
"I am your dad's friend"?

2302
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:04,860
- Why would you say that? - Everyone knows that.

2303
01:22:04,866 --> 01:22:07,400
- What was that? - Everyone knows that.

2304
01:22:07,402 --> 01:22:08,570
The first line.

2305
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:09,570
(Jae Seok is the last.)

2306
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:12,375
Irene.

2307
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:14,640
- The second line. - Without you...

2308
01:22:14,643 --> 01:22:15,740
The third line.

2309
01:22:15,744 --> 01:22:16,740
(It's the hardest part.)

2310
01:22:16,745 --> 01:22:18,945
There would be no Rinnai.

2311
01:22:19,114 --> 01:22:20,840
(It's hard to tell if it's plagiarism or not.)

2312
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:22,610
What was that?

2313
01:22:22,617 --> 01:22:30,455
- Irene! Irene! - Irene! Irene!

2314
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:33,390
- Irene, pick a member. - Irene.

2315
01:22:33,395 --> 01:22:34,460
We won't hold grudges,

2316
01:22:34,462 --> 01:22:35,490
- so you can pick comfortably. - That's right.

2317
01:22:35,497 --> 01:22:36,630
It's only a game.

2318
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:38,160
I have been overlooked for 10 years.

2319
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,160
(So it's okay.)

2320
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,160
I will pick...

2321
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:42,530
(Who will Irene pick?)

2322
01:22:42,537 --> 01:22:44,600
(Se Chan, the first one to mention Rinnai)

2323
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:46,570
(Kwang Soo, the plagiarizer)

2324
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:48,770
(Haha, the one with an old taste)

2325
01:22:48,777 --> 01:22:51,310
(Seok Jin, Dad's friend)

2326
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:54,950
(Jae Seok, the half-hearted plagiarizer)

2327
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,850
(Among these contestants,)

2328
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:58,350
I will pick Yang Se Chan.

2329
01:22:58,353 --> 01:23:00,150
(Irene picks Se Chan.)

2330
01:23:00,155 --> 01:23:02,950
(Se Chan and Irene become a couple.)

2331
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:04,620
Are you serious?

2332
01:23:04,626 --> 01:23:05,820
He is so happy.

2333
01:23:05,827 --> 01:23:08,325
(Thanks to Rinnai, he becomes a couple.)

2334
01:23:08,830 --> 01:23:12,300
Yang Se Chan! Yang Se Chan!

2335
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,960
I object!

2336
01:23:13,969 --> 01:23:16,005
(Throwing)

2337
01:23:16,037 --> 01:23:18,500
(Don't get in my way.)

2338
01:23:18,506 --> 01:23:20,470
- Get lost! - I object!

2339
01:23:20,475 --> 01:23:21,870
(Se Chan's family gathers.)

2340
01:23:21,876 --> 01:23:23,740
- I object! - No way!

2341
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:24,740
Se Chan!

2342
01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:26,040
Don't be ridiculous.

2343
01:23:26,047 --> 01:23:28,040
Don't you dare ruin this.

2344
01:23:28,049 --> 01:23:29,380
(Don't take away my partner.)

2345
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:31,510
Now, it's Joy's turn.

2346
01:23:31,519 --> 01:23:33,880
- Joy! Joy! - Joy! Joy!

2347
01:23:33,888 --> 01:23:36,390
(We love you, Joy.)

2348
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:37,790
- Joy! - She is holding my picture.

2349
01:23:37,792 --> 01:23:38,860
She is holding my picture.

2350
01:23:38,860 --> 01:23:40,760
Here are all the familiar faces.

2351
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:41,860
Hello.

2352
01:23:41,863 --> 01:23:43,190
- Hello. - We meet often.

2353
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:44,460
Hello.

2354
01:23:44,466 --> 01:23:46,330
I am here to have a new life.

2355
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:49,130
I used to like Irene,

2356
01:23:49,137 --> 01:23:50,330
but I switched over to Joy.

2357
01:23:50,338 --> 01:23:52,740
- I am on Running Man for Joy. - Of course.

2358
01:23:52,741 --> 01:23:56,970
Let's make a two-line poem about Joy.

2359
01:23:56,978 --> 01:23:59,010
Two-line poem? Again?

2360
01:23:59,014 --> 01:24:00,710
(Let's see what you can do.)

2361
01:24:00,715 --> 01:24:02,280
The first line.

2362
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:03,950
I really like you.

2363
01:24:03,952 --> 01:24:05,950
- That's good. - The second line.

2364
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:07,420
It's you.

2365
01:24:07,422 --> 01:24:08,990
She hates it.

2366
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:11,050
(She fails to school her face.)

2367
01:24:11,059 --> 01:24:12,160
(Was it that bad?)

2368
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,490
It's just that...

2369
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:16,130
I know he has a family.

2370
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:18,160
(I know he has a family.)

2371
01:24:18,166 --> 01:24:19,460
What does it have to do with this?

2372
01:24:19,467 --> 01:24:20,960
Everyone has a family!

2373
01:24:20,969 --> 01:24:23,130
I don't have a family!

2374
01:24:23,138 --> 01:24:24,770
- He has parents. - I don't have a family!

2375
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:25,940
What are you saying?

2376
01:24:25,940 --> 01:24:27,700
- I am serious. - It's your turn.

2377
01:24:27,709 --> 01:24:30,010
Give us a 2-line poem. The 1st line.

2378
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:31,040
(The first line)

2379
01:24:31,046 --> 01:24:33,140
Joy is...

2380
01:24:33,148 --> 01:24:34,540
The second line.

2381
01:24:34,549 --> 01:24:36,385
Strange.

2382
01:24:36,785 --> 01:24:38,520
(Is he picking a fight?)

2383
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,120
- Are you picking a fight? - Two-line poems are easy.

2384
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:42,820
No, no.

2385
01:24:42,824 --> 01:24:44,390
Don't you like it?

2386
01:24:44,392 --> 01:24:45,720
No.

2387
01:24:45,727 --> 01:24:48,020
- The first line. - The nation cherishes this woman.

2388
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:49,590
Go to the end of the line.

2389
01:24:49,597 --> 01:24:51,960
(He establishes himself as Dad's friend.)

2390
01:24:51,966 --> 01:24:53,830
- What? - How patriotic!

2391
01:24:53,835 --> 01:24:56,135
What was that?

2392
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:58,070
(Every time he opens his mouth, he takes people back to the 70s.)

2393
01:24:58,073 --> 01:25:00,570
- He startled me. - Do we live in the 70s?

2394
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:02,270
It was like the principal's speech in elementary school.

2395
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:03,570
The principal.

2396
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:04,740
Why won't you let me finish?

2397
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:05,780
(He is annoyed.)

2398
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,240
The first line.

2399
01:25:07,248 --> 01:25:09,210
(Jae Seok is last.)

2400
01:25:09,217 --> 01:25:11,115
Joy!

2401
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:16,150
(Since he started off powerfully, he just needs to conclude it well.)

2402
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:17,190
The second line.

2403
01:25:17,192 --> 01:25:19,090
You know what?

2404
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:20,890
- Is that it? - You know what?

2405
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:22,060
(What?)

2406
01:25:22,063 --> 01:25:23,830
- What was that? - Is that it?

2407
01:25:23,832 --> 01:25:25,130
Is that it?

2408
01:25:25,133 --> 01:25:27,060
You should have concluded it.

2409
01:25:27,068 --> 01:25:28,895
I don't know!

2410
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:30,800
(He fails to show his charms.)

2411
01:25:30,805 --> 01:25:32,400
- I don't know! - If you want to hear more,

2412
01:25:32,407 --> 01:25:33,770
pick me.

2413
01:25:33,775 --> 01:25:34,770
If you want to hear more, pick me.

2414
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:36,840
If you want to know why you are strange, pick me.

2415
01:25:36,845 --> 01:25:38,910
Do you want to know what comes after "It's you"?

2416
01:25:38,913 --> 01:25:41,615
Guess what comes after "The nation cherishes this woman."

2417
01:25:41,649 --> 01:25:43,650
I bet you are curious.

2418
01:25:43,651 --> 01:25:45,180
Pick someone.

2419
01:25:45,186 --> 01:25:46,450
The nation cherishes this woman.

2420
01:25:46,454 --> 01:25:48,985
I will partner up with Kwang Soo.

2421
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,860
(Kwang Soo and Joy become a couple.)

2422
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,920
- Come here. - In the end...

2423
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:54,920
Why did you do that earlier?

2424
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:56,390
I am sorry!

2425
01:25:56,398 --> 01:25:58,330
Gosh, you startled me.

2426
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,360
I am sorry!

2427
01:26:00,368 --> 01:26:02,300
(So Min tries to break them off out of habit.)

2428
01:26:02,303 --> 01:26:03,830
(Kwang Soo, our child is here.)

2429
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:06,500
- Gosh, you startled me. - She objected.

2430
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:08,270
(What is that face?)

2431
01:26:08,276 --> 01:26:11,810
- Lee Kwang Soo! Lee Kwang Soo! - My goodness.

2432
01:26:11,813 --> 01:26:13,810
(Stop bothering me and get lost.)

2433
01:26:13,815 --> 01:26:16,480
Three people without a partner should come here.

2434
01:26:16,484 --> 01:26:17,480
(3 couples have been born.)

2435
01:26:17,485 --> 01:26:18,980
We need to make couples...

2436
01:26:18,987 --> 01:26:20,750
out of the rest of the people.

2437
01:26:20,755 --> 01:26:22,020
For goodness' sake.

2438
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:26,020
All of us have emotional scars.

2439
01:26:26,027 --> 01:26:28,860
- Let's overcome this. - Try to come to a middle ground.

2440
01:26:28,863 --> 01:26:31,090
- Try to compromise, everyone. - Now...

2441
01:26:31,099 --> 01:26:32,800
We'll partner up for just one day.

2442
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:34,960
Let's just flip our hands for this.

2443
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:37,400
- Let's flip our hands for it. - It's "Flaming Youth" here.

2444
01:26:37,405 --> 01:26:38,600
(You can't fool the atmosphere.)

2445
01:26:38,606 --> 01:26:40,400
(The middle-aged celebrities become friends on this reality show.)

2446
01:26:40,408 --> 01:26:41,700
- How could you say that? - "Flaming Youth".

2447
01:26:41,709 --> 01:26:43,310
Look at Han Na. She's in that group.

2448
01:26:43,311 --> 01:26:45,480
What are you talking about?

2449
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,010
- What? "Flaming Youth"? - How could you say that?

2450
01:26:48,016 --> 01:26:49,880
- Will my wish finally come true? - Look at Seok Jin.

2451
01:26:49,884 --> 01:26:51,580
- My wish has come true at last. - His wish has been fulfilled.

2452
01:26:51,586 --> 01:26:53,650
- Hey, let's just flip for it. - You know,

2453
01:26:53,655 --> 01:26:55,190
let's be civil about this.

2454
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,950
- Let's do rock-paper-scissors. - Right.

2455
01:26:56,958 --> 01:26:59,890
- Actually, I don't want to do that. - Okay.

2456
01:26:59,894 --> 01:27:01,090
I had a great time in Switzerland...

2457
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:04,125
- with Han Na. - I want to pair up with Haha.

2458
01:27:04,365 --> 01:27:08,230
(They made such great memories in Switzerland.)

2459
01:27:08,236 --> 01:27:12,300
(Should we recreate that in Korea one more time?)

2460
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:14,200
- No way. - Goodness.

2461
01:27:14,209 --> 01:27:16,370
(She sounds firm.)

2462
01:27:16,377 --> 01:27:18,410
Why am I so darn attractive?

2463
01:27:18,413 --> 01:27:20,410
- No. - I have a family with two kids.

2464
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:22,480
- I have a family! - You're mine on Running Man.

2465
01:27:22,484 --> 01:27:24,050
- I have a family! - This is frustrating.

2466
01:27:24,052 --> 01:27:26,550
- No! - Then please let me dodge...

2467
01:27:26,554 --> 01:27:28,080
Seok Jin.

2468
01:27:28,089 --> 01:27:29,920
(She targets a niche market.)

2469
01:27:29,924 --> 01:27:32,660
I don't like you either. You think I want to pair up with you?

2470
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:34,990
- Please. Please not him. - Okay then.

2471
01:27:34,996 --> 01:27:36,390
- Why? - Here's what we'll do.

2472
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:39,400
Let's be cool about this and just point at the one we want.

2473
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,030
- We'll get matched like that? - If it's mutual, you'll pair up.

2474
01:27:41,035 --> 01:27:43,370
- I haven't seen that for a while. - It's been a while.

2475
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:45,570
- Don't drag this out. Be quick. - Okay.

2476
01:27:45,573 --> 01:27:47,140
- Once you're matched, it's over. - Okay, okay.

2477
01:27:47,141 --> 01:27:49,275
- Han Na, you're first. - Okay.

2478
01:27:49,444 --> 01:27:52,405
(Han Na chooses Haha.)

2479
01:27:52,447 --> 01:27:53,810
(How dare you?)

2480
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:55,140
(Biting)

2481
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:58,480
She really bit me. She didn't fake it.

2482
01:27:58,486 --> 01:27:59,950
You can choose now. That's right.

2483
01:27:59,954 --> 01:28:01,220
- It's your turn. - Point at someone.

2484
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:02,390
(Ji Hyo and Han Na chose Haha.)

2485
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,590
I want to enjoy this.

2486
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:06,490
(This is the first he's been chased by two women.)

2487
01:28:06,494 --> 01:28:08,490
Don't make a fool of yourself, and just pick someone.

2488
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,230
Shouldn't I listen to their acrostic poems?

2489
01:28:10,231 --> 01:28:11,930
Acrostic poem?

2490
01:28:11,933 --> 01:28:13,400
- Yes. - Then forget about him.

2491
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:15,570
- Haha. - Go ahead.

2492
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:18,405
(Chuckling)

2493
01:28:19,974 --> 01:28:23,245
- That was great. It was great. - She did well.

2494
01:28:23,378 --> 01:28:24,470
Ji Hyo.

2495
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:25,580
- Haha. - Go ahead.

2496
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,610
- Haha, you can't go anywhere. - "Ha".

2497
01:28:27,615 --> 01:28:29,515
- Ha. - "Ha!".

2498
01:28:30,585 --> 01:28:32,550
(Snorting)

2499
01:28:32,554 --> 01:28:33,580
- That was pretty good. - Goodness, it was great.

2500
01:28:33,588 --> 01:28:36,190
- That was quite charming. - She did a great job.

2501
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:38,960
Me too. I don't want him, but I just want to do the poem.

2502
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,960
- What is it? - Go ahead.

2503
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:41,220
Haha, you're so sexy.

2504
01:28:41,229 --> 01:28:42,230
- "Ha". - "Ha".

2505
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:44,225
(Letting out a moan)

2506
01:28:44,365 --> 01:28:46,000
(A deep sigh)

2507
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,230
- What was that? - She's driving me crazy.

2508
01:28:48,236 --> 01:28:50,700
- She did so well. - What are you doing?

2509
01:28:50,705 --> 01:28:52,300
- You disheveled your hair. - Seriously. I can't understand her.

2510
01:28:52,307 --> 01:28:54,770
- Now, she's rising up on my list. - Seriously.

2511
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:56,970
- I can't believe it. - That was cute.

2512
01:28:56,978 --> 01:28:59,110
- That was beautiful. - Both of them are such eyesores.

2513
01:28:59,113 --> 01:29:00,580
That was so cool.

2514
01:29:00,582 --> 01:29:03,510
- Okay, I'll choose now. - 1, 2, 3.

2515
01:29:03,518 --> 01:29:05,620
(Whom will Haha choose?)

2516
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,080
(Han Na, whom he faced the penalty together in Switzerland?)

2517
01:29:08,089 --> 01:29:13,220
(Or his regular partner during couple races?)

2518
01:29:13,227 --> 01:29:15,120
- Han Na! - Gosh.

2519
01:29:15,129 --> 01:29:17,060
(He chooses Han Na, his partner in Switzerland.)

2520
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:18,460
- Go, go. - It's over.

2521
01:29:18,466 --> 01:29:19,600
(Only the unwanted members remain.)

2522
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:22,300
- Tell you what. We're already... - Hey.

2523
01:29:22,303 --> 01:29:23,670
- All of us here are wounded. - Hey.

2524
01:29:23,671 --> 01:29:26,000
I'm here to work too. Let's just focus on working today.

2525
01:29:26,007 --> 01:29:28,140
- Listen, since we're all hurt... - Gosh.

2526
01:29:28,142 --> 01:29:30,840
All of us are hurt right now.

2527
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:32,240
- Let's just pair up. - Let's just do it.

2528
01:29:32,246 --> 01:29:34,110
- Let's just pair up. - Let's pair up.

2529
01:29:34,115 --> 01:29:35,680
- Let's flip our hands for it. - Should we?

2530
01:29:35,683 --> 01:29:38,180
- Let's flip for it. - Face it up or face it down

2531
01:29:38,186 --> 01:29:40,580
(Jae Seok and So Min pair up. Ji Hyo and Seok Jin pair up.)

2532
01:29:40,588 --> 01:29:41,990
- Okay. - Fine.

2533
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,990
(They'll focus on working to the max today.)

2534
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:44,850
Let's just work today.

2535
01:29:44,859 --> 01:29:48,460
- It's been a while. Green Siblings. - Hey, Jae Seok. Yes, that's right.

2536
01:29:48,463 --> 01:29:50,090
Yes, it's been a while.

2537
01:29:50,098 --> 01:29:52,935
(How will they perform during the race next week?)

2538
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:55,000
(Joy is weird!)

2539
01:29:55,003 --> 01:29:56,600
(I should say that to you.)

2540
01:29:56,604 --> 01:29:59,700
(She's back with her weirder self.)

2541
01:29:59,707 --> 01:30:01,200
(These previous partners...)

2542
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:03,310
(make a strange comeback to the variety show.)

2543
01:30:03,311 --> 01:30:05,310
(Why are we going this far today?)

2544
01:30:05,313 --> 01:30:07,610
(There's a reason for their hard work.)

2545
01:30:07,615 --> 01:30:11,610
(A thief stole the partner's heart under the name of love.)

2546
01:30:11,619 --> 01:30:15,050
(Deceived by love, the members are in pure torment.)

2547
01:30:15,056 --> 01:30:16,820
(What kind of a person are you?)

2548
01:30:16,824 --> 01:30:22,225
(Find the thief partner who stole the members' hearts!)

2549
01:30:22,964 --> 01:30:24,590
You never know what can happen.

2550
01:30:24,599 --> 01:30:27,500
(How will the flaming race of love and deception end?)

2551
01:30:27,502 --> 01:30:28,700
(Fantastic Partners become...)

2552
01:30:28,703 --> 01:30:30,665
(Crazy Partners)
