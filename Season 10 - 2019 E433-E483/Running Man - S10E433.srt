1
00:00:06,479 --> 00:00:08,880
- My gosh, it's starting now. - Goodness.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,280
It's winter!

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,850
This is a perfect place to bring your family. My son will love this.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,789
Gosh, It's so nice to come to a ski resort.

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,460
- At nights, they light up candles. - You would book a room here.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,859
- They light them up here? - Yes, the street looks so pretty.

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,060
- Is that so? - It's an awesome spot...

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,659
- for couples to visit. Yes. - Photos will look so beautiful.

9
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,870
I'll come back here when I get a boyfriend!

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,729
You can bring your family here.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,870
- Hey, look at Se Chan's hair. - What?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,970
- Se Chan, what's up with your hair? - He got a cute haircut.

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,140
- After my haircut, - My gosh.

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,309
- people said... - It looks familiar. Yeom Sang Soo.

15
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:40,309
(We've definitely seen it somewhere.)

16
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:41,680
He copied Yeom Sang Soo's hairstyle.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,879
I went to Gangnam for this haircut. They said this was trending now.

18
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,779
- Did you perm your side hair? - This haircut... Yes.

19
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,190
- It's the down perm. - You got the down perm?

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,489
- You had the down perm? - I got my front and back permed.

21
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,390
- Why did you get your hair permed? - I mean...

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,659
I was told I would look much younger if I kept my side hair down.

23
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,459
You can just use a few grains of rice to keep it down.

24
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:57,459
(You didn't need the perm.)

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,729
Grains of rice? Did you say grains of rice?

26
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,970
- You can mash them, - I'm a celebrity, after all.

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,340
filter them in the water, and apply it in the morning. It works well.

28
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,239
- Grains of rice? - Mash some grains of rice.

29
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,409
I thought that was your penalty.

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
- My hairstylist said it was great. - Exactly. I thought...

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,110
if Se Chan lost the race last week or something.

32
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,980
I wondered if the hairstyle was part of his penalty.

33
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,080
It doesn't matter if I get my hair done in Gangnam.

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,019
You know that two of your members are missing, right?

35
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,050
- We had no idea. - Me neither.

36
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,560
- I thought they were with us. - What?

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,619
- It's the penalty. - What? I see. The penalty.

38
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,060
- They had a penalty to face. - Come on out.

39
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,099
(What happened to Seok Jin and Kwang Soo who dreamed of revenge?)

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,700
- Hello. - Hi. Happy New Year.

41
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,869
Hi. Happy New Year.

42
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:40,670
- You should take off your shirt. - That's not a penalty.

43
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,569
- Hold on. What is that? - Come on.

44
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,509
- Their given penalty... - That was lame.

45
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,879
(A flood of criticisms)

46
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,379
Hey, what's wrong with you? Wearing this doesn't feel rewarding.

47
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:50,780
- That's too weak to be a penalty. - That's lame.

48
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
- Se Chan and I did that once. - This outfit is so embarrassing.

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,050
(He feels wronged.)

50
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:57,519
Hey, Kwang Soo. What is this? My goodness.

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,259
I've worn one with roosters. I began from the Year of Monkey.

52
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,330
Oh, right. He's the go-to guy for these kinds of outfits.

53
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,099
All right. You two have lost the race last week.

54
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,499
As a way to celebrate the Year of the Golden Pig,

55
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:13,369
you must give out every stuffed pig in your sacks...

56
00:02:13,369 --> 00:02:14,610
to join today's opening segment.

57
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,439
I'm all for the penalty.

58
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,640
But wearing this in a ski resort is too much.

59
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,080
(My gosh, I must take a photo of this!)

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,149
Gosh, this is...

61
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:25,679
(Embarrassing 2019)

62
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,050
Come on, it's the start of the New Year.

63
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,519
(Paying for the misfortune of 2019)

64
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,689
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

65
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,820
Do you want a stuffed pig?

66
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,059
(They start carrying out the penalty.)

67
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:36,260
- My gosh, your outfit. - Happy New Year.

68
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,200
- Happy New Year. - Thank you.

69
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,730
Hello, kid. Do you want one?

70
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,070
Say hello to him.

71
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,170
Do you want one?

72
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,300
Anthony, do you want a stuffed pig?

73
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:45,769
(Shaking his head)

74
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,739
- Do you not want it? - Wait.

75
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,469
(Please take one. I want to finish this.)

76
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,679
- He said he doesn't want it. - What?

77
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,939
I have a lot of plushies at home.

78
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,140
- He has a lot at home. - You don't want it?

79
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,249
- I have a lot of plushies at home. - I see.

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,179
- What's wrong? - He doesn't want one.

81
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,480
- He doesn't want one? - He has a lot at home.

82
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,350
- He already has a lot. - Gosh, he's so cute.

83
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:02,619
Bye.

84
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,820
- Happy New Year. - My gosh!

85
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,290
Happy New Year. Goodness.

86
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,929
- Happy New Year. - Thank you.

87
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:09,959
Bye.

88
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,360
That's lame. Really.

89
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:14,830
- This isn't funny at all. - They should've laughed.

90
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,070
Hold on. I'm funnier.

91
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,140
- Se Chan's hairstyle is funnier. - My hairstyle is funnier.

92
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,369
I'm serious. His hairstyle is funnier.

93
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,640
My gosh, they're getting criticized even after doing the penalty.

94
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,769
I didn't know, but you looked decent because of your hair.

95
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,380
- Yes, it stands out so much. - My hair made me look good?

96
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,040
- Exactly. - Yes, your hair matters a lot.

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,649
You look like a toad with your side hair down like that.

98
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,480
(You look like a toad with your side hair down like that.)

99
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,249
I didn't know about this before.

100
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:34,850
- Do I look fat? - A big toad?

101
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,290
- Hey, by the way... - I see. I didn't know.

102
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,360
- 2019 has dawned. - Okay.

103
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,860
- We're one year older than before. - Yes.

104
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,200
- Congratulations. - Okay.

105
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,160
- Seok Jin. - Seok Jin.

106
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,899
- He's the oldest? He's 54. - Yes.

107
00:03:47,929 --> 00:03:49,869
- 54. - 54.

108
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:50,869
- 54. - 54.

109
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:54,439
He kept dropping the number, 54, and now he's finally 54 years old.

110
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,839
- You've been on TV for so long. - My gosh.

111
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:58,140
He'll be 60 soon.

112
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,110
- Seok Jin is 54. - I'm serious.

113
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,880
And I turned 48 this year.

114
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,649
- 48. - 48.

115
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,580
- And Jong Kook is now... - 44.

116
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,390
- 44. - Double 4.

117
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,050
- We're 34. We're 34. - 44.

118
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,860
- We're 34. - 34.

119
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,089
- 34. - 34.

120
00:04:13,089 --> 00:04:14,089
(The youngest members of the same age)

121
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,260
(Recipient of Top Excellence Award and toad with a failed makeover)

122
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,460
Actually, So Min and Se Chan...

123
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,230
- are 34 years old. - We're not that young.

124
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,540
- They'd be department chiefs. - Yes, that's right.

125
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,199
Chiefs... They are as old as chiefs.

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,869
- We are as old as chiefs. - You could be chiefs.

127
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,780
My goodness, you shouldn't be here talking to us.

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,480
- Seok Jin. - What?

129
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,449
You shouldn't be doing this in that pig outfit.

130
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,579
(Looking pitiful)

131
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:38,980
- Let go. Let go of me. - Right now...

132
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,389
- Yes, my friend is a director now. - Right now...

133
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,290
My friend is a director of a conglomerate.

134
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,460
When my friend got promoted to a director, I'm wearing these pigs.

135
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,829
I'm wearing this pig outfit when my friend became a director.

136
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:51,499
- My gosh. - He's cute.

137
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,860
My role model used to be...

138
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,470
- Gyeong Gyu who has a long career, - Exactly.

139
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,239
but now, you're my role model. It's you.

140
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,509
- Goodness. - You have such a long career.

141
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:04,739
Anyway, he's my role model. Seok Jin is my role model.

142
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,949
- To celebrate the New Year, 2019, - Let's go now.

143
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,850
to bring good luck, to bring money, and to bring happiness,

144
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,150
- he'll show us the Bring-it Dance. - Bring-it Dance?

145
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:15,489
Bring it. Move forward.

146
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:18,220
If you ask me, I'll bring it

147
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,629
(Watch his Bring-it Dance, and bring a lot of good fortune.)

148
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,230
I'll comply even in the Year of the Pig.

149
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,800
- Bring-it Dance. - Look at his shoes.

150
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:29,929
You're making me cry. I'm crying now.

151
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:32,840
- Your director-friend is watching. - Come on, fix up your outfit.

152
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,270
- Your director-friend is watching. - My role model.

153
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,110
My role model.

154
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:39,110
I can't do it anymore. It's embarrassing.

155
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,949
Today, to celebrate the New Year, 2019,

156
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,720
with the wish that you will level up in every aspect,

157
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,150
we have the New Year Project.

158
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,119
Running Man Playing Game, also known as, RPG.

159
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,590
We have prepared Until You Reach the Highest Level Race.

160
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,290
- Until the Highest Level? - The Highest Level?

161
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:56,030
- RPG is a game. - Okay.

162
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,290
Do we need to level up?

163
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,329
Running Man Playing Game will begin now.

164
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,670
(Running Man Playing Game will begin now.)

165
00:06:03,869 --> 00:06:05,239
To play the RPG,

166
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,639
the players must find quests, scattered all over the site.

167
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,369
They can only acquire the items or level up...

168
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,110
when they complete their quests.

169
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,710
There are different ranks.

170
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:16,079
Just like games, there are different ranks.

171
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,449
Depending on the quests, players' level may go up or go down.

172
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,249
The moment a player reaches Level 10, the game is over.

173
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:26,119
The winning player will be given a great prize.

174
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,290
Whatever you imagine, it will be beyond your imagination.

175
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,530
- Really? - Is that so?

176
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,800
- We've prepared great prizes. - How good is it?

177
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:34,100
All right. It's RPG, the Highest Level Project.

178
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,230
Your first level-up mission is...

179
00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:38,300
It's called Rice Cake Soup in the Sky.

180
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,840
- Rice Cake Soup in the Sky? - Rice Cake Soup in the Sky?

181
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,670
Everyone's current level is one.

182
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,579
You can level up if you can eat a bowl of rice cake soup.

183
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,679
That's simple.

184
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:48,050
- We need to eat rice cake soup? - That's easy.

185
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,449
Then we'll distribute the badges for Level One.

186
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,720
By the way, what if...

187
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,220
- Jong Kook gets the highest level? - Right, exactly.

188
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,319
That won't happen.

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,860
- That can't happen. - Right.

190
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,259
I'm sure it won't be that easy.

191
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,889
I'm sure this will be difficult.

192
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:05,629
(Everyone starts the race as Level 1.)

193
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,999
All right. Before we start the race,

194
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:10,869
everyone will ride the gondola lift one by one.

195
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,340
- One by one? - Yes.

196
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,999
Why? What is it? What could this be?

197
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,809
My gosh, there's something else.

198
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:17,369
(Why are we riding the lift all separately?)

199
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,280
All right. Should we get on it now?

200
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,379
- 54. 54. - 54. 54.

201
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,249
- Everyone will ride it separately. - 54-year-old.

202
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,379
Here I go.

203
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,579
Hello.

204
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,090
Happy New Year.

205
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,449
(Seok Jin has entered.)

206
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,460
Seok Jin, there's your own close-up!

207
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,220
(His own close-up, a splendid feat after 54 years)

208
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,530
54-year-old, okay!

209
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,230
There's your close-up. Come on!

210
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,829
Happy New Year!

211
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,129
He keeps on saying the same thing.

212
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,470
(Is it lagging as soon as he logged in?)

213
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,829
- He doesn't know if it will air. - "Happy New Year."

214
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,999
All right. Let's get going.

215
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,939
(What kind of a quest awaits at the canyon?)

216
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,470
Gosh, what's the mission today? I can't even guess.

217
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,439
My gosh.

218
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:54,879
Whatever they tell you, try to stay calm.

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,910
(People log in one by one.)

220
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,480
(All of 8 players are on the gondola lifts now.)

221
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,689
(They will head over to the Snow Canyon now.)

222
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,389
My gosh.

223
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,889
I haven't been to a ski resort for a while now. It's so nice.

224
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,530
This is great.

225
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,230
(The players have entered.)

226
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,699
Something must be up since everyone took the lift by themselves.

227
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,699
Before you begin the quest,

228
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,030
acquire the ingredients first.

229
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,340
(Before reaching the Snow Canyon, they can obtain the ingredients.)

230
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,540
"Acquire the ingredients for rice cake soup."

231
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,179
"To level up and make the soup, you need eight ingredients."

232
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:28,449
"Choose one ingredient you need and acquire the chosen ingredient."

233
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,220
"However, if other players choose the same ingredients,"

234
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,949
"they will not be available." My gosh, what will I do?

235
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:35,550
"They will not be available."

236
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,990
(Choose one ingredient and acquire the ingredient.)

237
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,559
(I knew it. They wouldn't just give us the rice cake soup.)

238
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,990
My gosh, I need all of them.

239
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,490
Seasoning, water,

240
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,429
eggs, and beef.

241
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,800
(Which one must I choose?)

242
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,000
(Seok Jin is choosing his ingredient.)

243
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,199
What do you think is the most important ingredient?

244
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,300
It's the rice cake.

245
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:53,439
I will...

246
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:54,770
(Player Seok Jin...)

247
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,939
I will choose the rice cake.

248
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:57,939
(Player Seok Jin has chosen the rice cake.)

249
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,679
Everyone has chosen their ingredients.

250
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,150
Please check the result.

251
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,679
Everyone.

252
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,250
You all choose an ingredient on your way up here, right?

253
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,319
- Yes. - Yes.

254
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,420
All right. Out of the ingredients you have chosen,

255
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,920
I will remove the ones that no one chose...

256
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,620
and the ingredients that overlapped amongst yourselves.

257
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,719
- It was really hard. - All right.

258
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,660
- Seok Jin, you'll go first. - Okay.

259
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,929
- Please reveal the chosen card. - Okay.

260
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,530
- Gosh, please. - Seok Jin will go first.

261
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,530
You all know what I chose, right?

262
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:22,630
- You know how I play, right? - Okay, okay. Go ahead.

263
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,130
- Rice cake! - It's rice cake as expected.

264
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,370
- See? - All right.

265
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:27,140
All right. So Min. It's your turn, So Min.

266
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,870
- I chose the pot. - Yes!

267
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,179
(Player So Min has chosen the pot.)

268
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Okay.

269
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,010
(Since they chose different cards, they have the rice cake and pot.)

270
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,709
(Since they chose different cards, they have the rice cake and pot.)

271
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:36,880
- Gosh, you are unbelievable. - Okay.

272
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,280
- Did you choose the pot? - He chose the pot.

273
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,380
Please, no.

274
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,120
- Why did you... - Jae Seok.

275
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,620
(Player Jae Seok has chosen the pot.)

276
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,359
(Both So Min and Jae Seok chose the pot.)

277
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,660
- What a great start. - Come on.

278
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,290
My gosh, I chose the pot.

279
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:51,429
Jae Seok and I click sometimes at the worst timing.

280
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:52,729
That was useless. Why...

281
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,729
- My gosh... - Didn't you choose beef?

282
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:55,870
There was an order we rode the lift.

283
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,069
I was the 3rd one to ride it. Because I was the 3rd one...

284
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,670
There were 8 players and 8 ingredients.

285
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,870
- Which one did you choose? - There are eight of us.

286
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,010
I chose it in order.

287
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,510
- I chose it according to the order. - You chose the rice cake?

288
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,839
- My gosh. - What is this?

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:06,880
- Seriously. - Come on.

290
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,109
- You can't blame this on me. - Fine.

291
00:10:08,109 --> 00:10:10,380
(They have lost the rice cake among the 8 ingredients.)

292
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,020
- That's why I chose beef. - I didn't know at all.

293
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,719
- I also own a barbecue restaurant. - Exactly.

294
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:15,650
- Beef was the fourth one. - Good job. Well done.

295
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,719
- Great job. - My gosh, beef.

296
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,719
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

297
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:19,260
Since I was the fifth one...

298
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,990
- I thought we'd go in order. - Exactly. My gosh.

299
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,130
- You were thoughtful. - I chose the water.

300
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,429
- Well done. - There you go.

301
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,760
(The ace player has chosen the water.)

302
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,270
- Kwang Soo. - You are indeed awesome.

303
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,800
(They have beef and water for now.)

304
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,339
(The portable burner, eggs, dried lavers, and seasoning remain.)

305
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,010
(If he had chosen 1 of them, they would have 3 ingredients.)

306
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,109
- I chose the rice cake. - That little...

307
00:10:41,109 --> 00:10:42,880
(Giraffe-lover chose the rice cake.)

308
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,550
- You ought to think first. - Come on.

309
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,650
Mr. Pot.

310
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,990
(Look who's talking.)

311
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:52,660
You should have thought someone would choose the rice cake.

312
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,020
I thought that's why no one would pick this one.

313
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,959
I had no idea that you would choose the pot.

314
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,099
- Did you choose the pot too? - What did you choose?

315
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,699
- I got the pot too. - I thought you wouldn't.

316
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:00,859
- I got it too. - No.

317
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,099
I got the pot too.

318
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,000
- 3 rice cake and 3 pots. - What is this?

319
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,809
The players have acquired beef and water out of eight ingredients.

320
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,609
Among eight ingredients for the level-up mission,

321
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:11,510
the pot, portable burner, rice cake, eggs, dried laver,

322
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,349
- and seasoning have disappeared. - A lot of ingredients disappeared.

323
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,780
Find the ingredients that had disappeared.

324
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,620
Find the R spots on your own,

325
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,550
and when you carry out the quests at the spots,

326
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,089
- you can find the ingredients. - Okay.

327
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:25,219
(Find the R flags and complete the quests.)

328
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,219
How are we supposed to do this?

329
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,429
(The race has begun. Good luck.)

330
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,760
Would it be somewhere over here?

331
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,329
Wouldn't it be inside there?

332
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,130
Let's go check.

333
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,569
(They must find the quests to find the missing ingredients.)

334
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,699
I don't see anything here.

335
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,740
This place is huge. How can I find that?

336
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,910
There should be a better way to find the flags.

337
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,839
I really want to find it. I don't think it's here.

338
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,410
- I need to find the items... - Yes, we need to find them now.

339
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,410
We're supposed to find them as we walk around the whole day.

340
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,780
Is... Is that supposed to be fun then?

341
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,949
I don't know. I don't know that either.

342
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,290
I've never played such a game.

343
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,359
- My gosh, this is... - Let's go.

344
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,359
(As Jong Kook and Ji Hyo move...)

345
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:02,559
- Jong Kook. - Hey, Jong Kook is going somewhere.

346
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,660
Let's follow him.

347
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,459
Jong Kook is over there.

348
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,729
- Hey, why is this locked? - What's this?

349
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:08,900
- Here it is. - Look at this.

350
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,140
(He finds the envelope for the quest.)

351
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,040
- Look at this. It's locked. - What's this?

352
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,300
The door is locked, but I found this here.

353
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,040
(They have discovered the quest.)

354
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,010
"Decipher the Code"?

355
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,449
"For the passcode of the locked door,"

356
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,579
"decipher the code or find the code, buried somewhere..."

357
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,750
"in the snow field."

358
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,479
- Jae Seok, come here! - Hey, come here.

359
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,589
Jae Seok!

360
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Jae Seok!

361
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:30,849
- We found it. - We found it.

362
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:31,890
- Look. There's a code. - Look at this.

363
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:33,459
All right. Look.

364
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,089
- We can either decipher the code... - Here it is.

365
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:37,229
or the code is hidden somewhere in the snow field.

366
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:38,400
Where? What did you say?

367
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,959
- In the snow field? - We must crack the code.

368
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,370
- The passcode... - We must get the passcode.

369
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,500
Here's an important part. These are all numbers,

370
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,000
- but it's alphabet here. - These are letters.

371
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,569
(The hint is in numbers, but the code is in letters.)

372
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:51,140
(How can we connect the numbers with the alphabet?)

373
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,939
- Hey, I got it! - This is...

374
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,750
- A, B, C, D... - Exactly.

375
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,880
- Hold on. - This one corresponds to G.

376
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:58,880
- All right. G. - G.

377
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,650
(Then the 8th letter is H.)

378
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,790
My gosh, how will we find the code like that?

379
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,859
- What about overlapping letters? - Must we write all of them?

380
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,329
"Find the code, buried somewhere in the snow field."

381
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:12,429
(Find the code, buried somewhere in the snow field.)

382
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:13,959
- We should just look for it. - Hey.

383
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,000
- When will we solve the puzzle? - Hey, the puzzle is faster.

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,270
- This one is faster. - I'll stick with this one.

385
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,599
- I give up. Okay. - Hey, this is much faster.

386
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:20,000
- Try to use your brain. - This is way faster.

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,839
- I mean... - I know that this isn't easy.

388
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,969
Hey.

389
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,309
(Deciphering the code versus searching for the code)

390
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't we need to go down to reach the snow field?

391
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,209
(Which group will be able to open up the door first?)

392
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:28,510
Should we go down here?

393
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:31,550
My gosh, how will we find it here?

394
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,620
- Can you see anything, Kwang Soo? - I don't see anything here.

395
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:35,949
How will we find it here?

396
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,089
The snow field?

397
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:38,819
(It's equivalent to looking for a needle in a haystack.)

398
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,359
Is it better to decipher the code?

399
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,459
- Seok Jin. - By the way...

400
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,630
(By the way...)

401
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,760
Our group...

402
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
We're the dumb ones.

403
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:47,800
- We're not dumb. - We're the dumb ones.

404
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,099
- 3 rice cakes, and 1 pot. - No.

405
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,300
The people...

406
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,439
who didn't solve the puzzle and came down here from there...

407
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:55,640
are a bit...

408
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,939
- dense including myself. - No way.

409
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,179
We're just active.

410
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,939
- Let's say that we're active. - I came down right away.

411
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,179
I'm sure there are patterns.

412
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,209
- Patterns? - There has to be a pattern there.

413
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,979
- My gosh, this is... - Hey, take a look at this.

414
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,449
How many letters are there?

415
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,550
- 1, 2, 3, 4, - 1, 2...

416
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,020
- 5. - There are 5 here.

417
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:12,290
How many are there?

418
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,890
There are eight.

419
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,260
Let's get rid of numbers that overlap.

420
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,630
(The overlapping numbers must be somehow relevant.)

421
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,729
Goodness, this...

422
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,059
My gosh, this is hard.

423
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,870
1, 2, 3, 4...

424
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,969
I don't think that's relevant.

425
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:24,839
7, 8. These numbers are all the same, aren't they?

426
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,370
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Never mind.

427
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,469
- There are only six. - Right.

428
00:14:27,469 --> 00:14:28,640
(Even the first quest is difficult.)

429
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,910
Goodness, this...

430
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,839
Wait, hold on. Isn't this shape of an E?

431
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:35,109
- Isn't this shape of an E? - That's an E. E.

432
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,650
- That's E. - This one is L.

433
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,880
(The number, 1, make up the letter, L.)

434
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,650
- 5... - Where's 3?

435
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,219
This is for number five.

436
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:43,620
- L. - L.

437
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:44,819
- Number five makes L too. - It's L.

438
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,030
- E-L-E? - L-E-L-E-L-E.

439
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,459
- Should we try it? - Isn't that L-I-E?

440
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,329
- E-L-E-L-E. - Let's try this in order.

441
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:52,400
I.

442
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,959
In order? But I'm not sure where I should start first.

443
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,400
Let's give it a try first.

444
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:57,099
- 2, 2, 3. - But there are numbers.

445
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,939
- Number ones make up L. - Yes, it's L.

446
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,839
- Number twos make up E. - You're right!

447
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,069
- Number twos make up E. - You're right!

448
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,579
- Number threes make up V. - It's V. V.

449
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,010
- Hey, hold on. - Number four.

450
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,650
- Number fours make up E. E again. - My gosh.

451
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,179
- Okay, Seok Jin. - You should've been a detective.

452
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,550
- Number fives make up L. - It's L.

453
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,750
- Le... - L.

454
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,650
- Level. - Level.

455
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,290
- "Level" is the code. - Gosh, Jong Kook.

456
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,020
(Will "level" be the right code?)

457
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,229
- It worked. - Did it work?

458
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,589
- Okay. - Amazing.

459
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,929
(No way! It's unlocked!)

460
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:27,559
- Wait. - We were just...

461
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,030
- Level! - Shouldn't we tell others?

462
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,069
Let them exercise on the field.

463
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,969
(They enter into the Quest Castle with their sharp intellect.)

464
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,439
- Let's go. - This is nice. It's nice.

465
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,510
Let's close the door.

466
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,439
- We can't close the door. - The others have to come in too.

467
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:39,979
Let's try the next one by ourselves.

468
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:41,709
(You have completed the quest. Find the next quest.)

469
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,050
There it is.

470
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,449
(He finds something.)

471
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:45,949
Wait. What's this?

472
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:49,550
(Haha finds an R flag and tubes.)

473
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:51,819
Quest.

474
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:53,189
I found it.

475
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:55,429
(A quest has been found.)

476
00:15:56,329 --> 00:15:57,530
"Shoot the Tubes".

477
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,229
"Stick your bottom in a tube and shoot it."

478
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,170
"If the eight members' tubes fly more than 10m in total,"

479
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,569
"the location of one ingredient will be revealed."

480
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,640
"If you fail,"

481
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,910
"one member has to go down a level to get another chance."

482
00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:11,979
- Let's start from So Min. - So Min.

483
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,240
Okay.

484
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,609
Me? Okay.

485
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:15,679
Come here.

486
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,010
Okay.

487
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,020
Kwang Soo, help with the tubes.

488
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
- Active ones! - This is... Yes?

489
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,319
So Min.

490
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,250
(She falls from the beginning.)

491
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,319
- Hold on. - What's wrong?

492
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,390
So Min.

493
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,620
So Min, hold me.

494
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,689
Stand behind the line.

495
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:30,729
So Min.

496
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:31,959
Bend your body even lower.

497
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:32,959
(Wobbly)

498
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,599
(She falls again.)

499
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,969
- There you go. - Even lower.

500
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:37,770
- This looks good. - That's enough.

501
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,900
- You're ready. - You can start.

502
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,800
It's going to shoot...

503
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,439
It's going to shoot so far.

504
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:43,839
- Watch out. It might hit you. - Come here.

505
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,439
The rest of you, step back.

506
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,640
So Min.

507
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,010
1, 2, 3. Start!

508
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,380
Start! 1, 2, 3.

509
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,150
(She thrusts her bottom out...)

510
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,890
(and falls.)

511
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:58,859
(Let me lie down for a moment.)

512
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,020
- Hey. - What was that?

513
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,429
- Hey! - So Min!

514
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:03,990
You shouldn't lie down. Shoot it.

515
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,300
- So Min. - Let me try again.

516
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,460
- You can't. - 22cm.

517
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,129
20cm.

518
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:11,329
- It was funny at least. - It was funny at least.

519
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,669
Jae Seok, show us.

520
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,369
- Should I? - Yes, please.

521
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,440
- Back in the day... - You're the master.

522
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,579
I was good at it back in the kungkungta days.

523
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,639
That's right.

524
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:20,680
(I used to shoot some tubes.)

525
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,750
(His bottom-thrusting started already then.)

526
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,649
(He was praised by Kang Ho Dong as the tube ace.)

527
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,119
Push the tube down.

528
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,960
- Push it down. - All the way.

529
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,119
(The tube has to be pushed down all the way.)

530
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,690
- All the way. - Like this?

531
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,530
- Good. - It's all the way down now.

532
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,859
Show us.

533
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,659
- 2, 3. - 2, 3.

534
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,629
(His butt that's been asleep for a long time...)

535
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:45,000
(finally awakens.)

536
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:50,369
(So Min, watch me. This is how you shoot a tube.)

537
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,409
Hey.

538
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,879
The tube was too far down.

539
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,510
- What did you do? - It was too far down.

540
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,180
The tube was too far down.

541
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,450
Why...

542
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,980
It was too far down.

543
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,589
- It's hard. - Hold on.

544
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,450
- What did you do? - What's with you?

545
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,559
It was too far down.

546
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,790
- How far down did you mean? - You said all the way down.

547
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,260
- It was too far down. - You said all the way down.

548
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,260
I've never tried this before.

549
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,460
(Jae Seok, are you watching?)

550
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,970
- 54! - 54!

551
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,740
(Here comes the 54-year-old.)

552
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,569
(Let me show you the power of a middle-aged man.)

553
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:22,740
Bend down even lower.

554
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:24,440
Even lower.

555
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,510
(Let me show you the power of a middle-aged man.)

556
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,079
- Hold him. - Okay.

557
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,149
- Bend down. - There you go.

558
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,680
(Kwang Soo is almost choking Seok Jin.)

559
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,550
- It's going down. - There you go.

560
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,190
There you go.

561
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,950
Bend your knees.

562
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,290
- Okay. - Good.

563
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,589
- Ready. - Okay.

564
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,359
(Here we go.)

565
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,760
- Ready. - 1, 2, 3.

566
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,859
(With everyone's help, Seok Jin is ready to shoot the tube.)

567
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,200
1, 2, 3.

568
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,829
(How far will it go?)

569
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:51,869
Gosh.

570
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:52,940
(It lands right in front of Seok Jin.)

571
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,099
Three.

572
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:56,669
What is this? It didn't go far.

573
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,780
It's exactly what I expected of him.

574
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,839
(The 3 members managed to shoot only 90cm in total.)

575
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,879
You should bend down low.

576
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,849
(Let me raise the record.)

577
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:05,849
It was okay.

578
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:07,750
You have to bend down like this.

579
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,020
That was close.

580
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,819
- Se Chan. - Try it.

581
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,319
- Good. - There you go.

582
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,790
It looks perfect.

583
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,960
How does it feel?

584
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,159
It feels good.

585
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,530
- Are you ready? - Yes.

586
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,930
- Okay. - It looks so stable.

587
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,500
1, 2, 3.

588
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,069
- Look at that. - Oh, my.

589
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,430
(Flying)

590
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,000
It went back.

591
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,940
(It flew quite far,)

592
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,710
(but it went back.)

593
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,879
(Se Chan shoots 1m 20cm.)

594
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,210
It went back.

595
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,950
It went back.

596
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,879
- It's over 2m now? - You did well.

597
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,079
Do your best.

598
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,690
Let's keep going like this.

599
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,950
- Let's do it. - Good.

600
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,250
Done.

601
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,359
He's ready.

602
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,490
Your upper body...

603
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:47,690
Yes!

604
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,059
Good!

605
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,859
(But)

606
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,069
(It lands at 1m 60cm.)

607
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,530
Why couldn't you do better?

608
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,740
What is this?

609
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,899
Let me try.

610
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,809
(Jong Kook steps up.)

611
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:02,839
Let me try.

612
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,740
It'd be great if someone can shoot 3m.

613
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,909
Like this?

614
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,909
If it goes too deep, it won't shoot.

615
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,879
Can it go down even further?

616
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,280
There you go.

617
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,649
Let me try.

618
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,550
The angle is important.

619
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:15,849
Good.

620
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,690
(The tube flies much longer this time.)

621
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,119
- Good! - How far did it go?

622
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,530
(It lands a lot farther away from the line.)

623
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,930
(It lands at 2m 20cm.)

624
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,200
Okay. Is it done?

625
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,430
- 2m 20cm. - Okay.

626
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,730
- 2m 20cm. - Good.

627
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,129
- It wasn't bad. - Haha, please do well.

628
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,970
Haha is good at it.

629
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,200
You have to make it nice and tight.

630
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,339
Are you the last player?

631
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:36,809
What's the number now?

632
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:41,210
(Haha and Ji Hyo have to shoot more than 3m 50cm.)

633
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,409
(Do like I did, Haha.)

634
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,680
Haha's legs have become strong.

635
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,480
(He thrusts his bottom.)

636
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,290
Please take us to 5m.

637
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,319
(Haha should take them near 10m.)

638
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,520
It's almost there.

639
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,859
(Haha should take them near 10m.)

640
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,790
(Flying)

641
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,829
- Good! - Yes!

642
00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:01,059
(Haha shoots 2m 30cm.)

643
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,129
(He is the unexpected master.)

644
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,500
Good!

645
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,800
(Now there is only 1.2m to go.)

646
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,940
Okay. It's Ji Hyo's turn.

647
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,210
- Ji Hyo. - We're almost there.

648
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,040
Let's continue this way.

649
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,109
The tube is all the way down.

650
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,309
Is she the last player?

651
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,349
- Stand up quickly. - Straighten your body.

652
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,849
- Your hands... - Raise your upper body.

653
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,419
- We can do this. - Okay.

654
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:23,490
Ji Hyo.

655
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,550
Ji Hyo, let's do it.

656
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,389
1, 2, 3.

657
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:27,760
Good!

658
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,059
(Powerful)

659
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,260
No!

660
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,930
(The tube is bouncing near 2m.)

661
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,770
(They only have 1m 20cm to go, and the tube is bouncing.)

662
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,839
(This will determine if they will get another ingredient.)

663
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,839
(It lands far back.)

664
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,040
We have to try again.

665
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:47,579
(It reaches beyond 2m,)

666
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:49,510
(but it ended up near 1m.)

667
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,919
- We failed? - We didn't make it?

668
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,190
By how much?

669
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,190
It's 9.8m.

670
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,790
(The result is 9m 80cm.)

671
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,990
Jae Seok!

672
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,490
If only So Min and Jae Seok hadn't failed...

673
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,430
Gosh.

674
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,829
Jae Seok shot only 10cm.

675
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,500
To win another chance,

676
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,700
one of you has to go down a level.

677
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,899
(One of them has to go down a level.)

678
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:14,339
(Everyone is at Level 1 right now.)

679
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:18,240
Those who shot less than 1m.

680
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,649
(They compete to determine who should go down a level.)

681
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,950
By the way,

682
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,280
why is it the three of us again?

683
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
- Wait. - Gosh.

684
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,889
We even went to Hong Kong together.

685
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,050
That's right.

686
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,760
- We failed our mission. - We failed.

687
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,559
(They get back together after 2 weeks.)

688
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,290
I'm on a different level from them.

689
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,260
- I shot 60cm. - I'm the best among us.

690
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,800
- You shot only 10cm, right? - Yes.

691
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,069
- Gosh. - By the way,

692
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,200
he really looks old.

693
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,740
- His pants make him look old. - They do.

694
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,510
Okay.

695
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,579
(Seok Jin is wearing an old man's pants.)

696
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,139
Hold on. Let me...

697
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,250
(They make sure Seok Jin doesn't cheat.)

698
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,510
Let me fix this.

699
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:59,119
(Let go of me.)

700
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,089
(What?)

701
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,919
(Where is the tube?)

702
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,059
(It lands at 10cm.)

703
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,790
Why were you holding me?

704
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,089
You were moving your arms.

705
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:10,730
You shouldn't use your arms.

706
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,730
I wasn't going to use them.

707
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,730
Your arms...

708
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,730
So Min. You should...

709
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,230
- So Min is good. - She's good.

710
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,139
Like this.

711
00:23:20,139 --> 00:23:21,599
(She looks more determined this time.)

712
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,409
(The three of them do their best to avoid the penalty.)

713
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:27,940
Three.

714
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,609
(Will she manage to avoid going down a level?)

715
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:30,750
Look at that.

716
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,649
(Will she manage to avoid going down a level?)

717
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:33,649
What's happening?

718
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:35,250
(Worried)

719
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,290
(Bouncing)

720
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,889
(It falls right away.)

721
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,359
(Minus 30cm)

722
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,930
No!

723
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,859
This doesn't count!

724
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,030
No!

725
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,930
- Okay. Minus. - This is...

726
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,500
- What is this? - Minus.

727
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
So Min is so unlucky.

728
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,470
- Why... - It's So Min.

729
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,109
- You're at level zero. - So Min.

730
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,569
What is this?

731
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,639
Sorry.

732
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,409
(So Min goes down to Level 0.)

733
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,750
In the beginning...

734
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,950
The first five people should finish it.

735
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,419
2m by 5 people.

736
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,220
I don't want to go last.

737
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,859
So Min, that's better.

738
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:12,990
- Let's go. - Look at the ceiling.

739
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,190
- Look at the ceiling. - Look at the ceiling.

740
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,359
Look at the ceiling.

741
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:18,230
- 1, 2, 3. - Let's go!

742
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,659
Yes!

743
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,760
(The power of demotion)

744
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,000
See?

745
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,470
- See? - You did it.

746
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,940
- So Min. - She did it.

747
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:28,839
So Min. See?

748
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,139
- 1m 60cm. - So Min.

749
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:32,309
- You have to look at the ceiling. - Good job.

750
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:33,609
- Look up. - Let me go first.

751
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,579
Five people should finish it.

752
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:36,980
Haha.

753
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
(Haha holds the highest record of 2m 30cm.)

754
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,379
- You can do this! - You can do this!

755
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,520
All right.

756
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,889
Start!

757
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:44,119
(Will he do well this time too?)

758
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,460
(Shooting)

759
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,960
(It flies high.)

760
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,389
- 2m. - Good.

761
00:24:50,389 --> 00:24:53,099
- Nice. - 2m.

762
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:54,329
It's not bad.

763
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:57,669
If we fail again, another person has to go down a level.

764
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,099
Focus.

765
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,369
(Let's maintain our levels and eat rice cake soup.)

766
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,940
It's all right.

767
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,139
(Se Chan 2m, Ji Hyo 1m 10cm)

768
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:05,409
- Nice. - Good.

769
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,780
Good!

770
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,750
- It went quite far. - That was close.

771
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,950
I think we'll succeed.

772
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,050
But...

773
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,250
(Kwang Soo was so confident.)

774
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,550
Seriously.

775
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,050
(He records 0cm.)

776
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,020
- You tried to be funny. - No.

777
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,119
It was real.

778
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,190
(Seok Jin laughed at Kwang Soo.)

779
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,129
- This is strange. - No.

780
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:25,200
This is strange.

781
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,359
(Embarrassed)

782
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,800
- Who should go down... - What should we do?

783
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,930
It's minus.

784
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,770
Okay. Look at the ceiling.

785
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,869
- He can finish it. - Look at the ceiling.

786
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,740
How much is left?

787
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,169
1.6m.

788
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,440
- It's not much. - We have 1.6m to go.

789
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,579
- Perfect. - Okay.

790
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,780
- Let's go! - It looks perfect.

791
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:44,750
- Here we go. - It looks perfect.

792
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,780
- Good. - 1, 2, 3.

793
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,950
(He shoots the tube, hoping this will be the last try.)

794
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:52,760
(In his first try, he shot 2m 20cm.)

795
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,290
(1m 60cm should be no problem for him.)

796
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,359
What's with him?

797
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:00,430
(What?)

798
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,069
- My goodness. - He's a spy.

799
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:05,369
(He shoots only 80cm this time.)

800
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,639
- He's a spy. - No.

801
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:09,569
- He's a spy. - Jong Kook.

802
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:11,109
- What? - 90cm?

803
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:13,309
- What did you do? - What's wrong?

804
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:15,309
- 90cm? - It's not bad.

805
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,109
Are you a spy?

806
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:19,180
No. There is no spy today.

807
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:20,849
Just step forward.

808
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,520
- Step forward. - Seriously.

809
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,919
We have no choice.

810
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,050
It has to be you.

811
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,760
Jong Kook and you...

812
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,319
Kwang Soo too.

813
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:30,460
- The three of them... - No.

814
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,829
- Not me. - You too.

815
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,500
- Seok Jin has to be in too. - It's the three of us.

816
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:38,639
One of us three will be holding the badge.

817
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,500
Each of you choose one of us.

818
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,770
The one who chooses the person holding the badge will take it.

819
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,909
- Are you okay with that? - Yes.

820
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:44,940
All right.

821
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:47,339
(Whispering)

822
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,050
- Turn around. - Turn around.

823
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,250
(One of them is holding the badge.)

824
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,520
Unlucky ones, do you want to choose first?

825
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,319
I want to go later.

826
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,020
I want to go later too.

827
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,520
You go first.

828
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,059
(Jong Kook is going to choose one first.)

829
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,430
(One of them is holding the Level 0 badge.)

830
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,530
Gosh.

831
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,559
(The other two's hands are empty.)

832
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,030
I don't think Haha is holding anything.

833
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,669
(If he chooses the person holding the badge, he will go down a level.)

834
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:16,639
(Jong Kook approaches Haha.)

835
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,780
- His hands... - It shows.

836
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,940
Two of them have nothing, right?

837
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,550
- That's right. - I think it's Se Chan.

838
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,550
(Whose hands are empty?)

839
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,750
- Two of them have nothing? - Nothing.

840
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,319
(Thinking)

841
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,750
I choose Haha.

842
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,690
(Jong Kook chooses Haha.)

843
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,389
- Haha. - My business partner.

844
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:35,329
We can relax. I think it's Haha.

845
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,129
- I think so too. - Should he open his hand?

846
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:38,800
Please open your hand.

847
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,629
I'll open it.

848
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:41,859
Start.

849
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,899
(Empty)

850
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:46,470
- Yes! - Yes!

851
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,500
What a relief.

852
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,339
(Jong Kook maintains his level.)

853
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay.

854
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,770
(So it's one of us?)

855
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,040
My goodness.

856
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,139
(So it's one of us?)

857
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,250
- Look at Se Chan's poker face. - I knew it.

858
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,680
(They have their poker face on.)

859
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,020
- He wanted to go last. - That's right.

860
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,649
- He said that. - Yes.

861
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:02,690
I choose Jae Seok.

862
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,649
- I'm done. - Okay.

863
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,389
I was chosen by Seok Jin.

864
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:08,690
Yes.

865
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,329
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

866
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:16,129
(We don't care about the tubes anymore. This is our real quest.)

867
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:20,740
(Who is holding the badge, Jae Seok or Se Chan?)

868
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:22,000
Congratulations.

869
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,270
(Congratulations, Seok Jin.)

870
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,510
Why...

871
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,309
(Seok Jin is going down a level.)

872
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:27,639
- He is my role model. - Why...

873
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,780
- Why... - Did you see that?

874
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:31,950
All the unlucky ones come to me.

875
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,149
Seok Jin and I are to compete.

876
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,649
(Seok Jin goes down to Level 0.)

877
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,119
We have to shoot the tubes again, right?

878
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,389
Let's start from the good ones.

879
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:42,760
Let's do that.

880
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,359
It's deflated.

881
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,800
(Okay. Let me start.)

882
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,470
Kwang Soo, step aside. Let's start from Jong Kook.

883
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,730
(Let's start from Jong Kook.)

884
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,040
Step aside.

885
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,740
- I'll do better this time. - Okay.

886
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,069
I'll do better.

887
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,339
- I'll do better. - There you go.

888
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,740
- I'll show you. - Okay.

889
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,010
I'm ready.

890
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,510
- Should I go? - Yes.

891
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,690
(In the last round, he was suspected to be a spy.)

892
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,659
(He wants to make up for it.)

893
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,919
1, 2...

894
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,020
(Determined)

895
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,260
(Rolling)

896
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,530
- Oh, my. - It's over.

897
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,760
(The tube rolls...)

898
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,569
(and lands at 2m 90cm.)

899
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,399
That's more like Jong Kook.

900
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,740
Okay. It's over.

901
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,099
- It's over. - It's over.

902
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,770
Why did you do that last time?

903
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:33,010
The tube didn't sit right last time.

904
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,040
It was okay this time.

905
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,409
(Se Chan shoots 2m.)

906
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,149
- Good! - Yes!

907
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,579
(Jae Seok manages to shoot 1.6m too.)

908
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:42,990
Not bad.

909
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,649
Fall over.

910
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,659
- Yes! - That's a relief.

911
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,760
(The tube master steps up.)

912
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,859
It's over.

913
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,430
(By Haha shooting 2.7m,)

914
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,129
(they break the 10m barrier.)

915
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,569
- It's over. - Haha.

916
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,339
He's my brother.

917
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,409
(They finally complete the tube quest.)

918
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:04,440
Unbelievable.

919
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,940
- We should have done this earlier. - Haha is amazing.

920
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,480
We should have done this earlier.

921
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,510
I'm so proud of myself right now.

922
00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:13,250
There.

923
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:17,750
"Choose 2 people to get the ingredient."

924
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,389
"The ingredient is in sight."

925
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:21,490
"It is at the end of a cold, difficult road."

926
00:30:23,089 --> 00:30:27,329
(The ingredient is at the end of a cold, difficult road?)

927
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,629
"Choose 2 people to get the ingredient."

928
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,000
(Choose 2 people.)

929
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,000
It's probably going to be hard.

930
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:36,339
It's at the end of a cold, difficult road.

931
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,470
This...

932
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,480
(2 people have to go on a cold, difficult road.)

933
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,680
- Race of Wits. - Sure.

934
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,550
(In a situation like this, Race of Wits is the best.)

935
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,379
- Race of Wits? - We'll play only one round.

936
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:49,089
- The last two people lose. - Okay.

937
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,149
- This is the only round. - Okay.

938
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,760
- Do you understand? - Gosh.

939
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,859
- Okay. - I'll say, "two".

940
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,559
- I'm "1". - I'm "1".

941
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,930
- I'm serious. - I'm "2".

942
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,460
- I'll say, "1". - I'm "1".

943
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,659
I'm always "one".

944
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,399
- I'm telling you. - I'm "one".

945
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:02,730
- Start. - One.

946
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:04,800
Those two...

947
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,500
(Kwang Soo and So Min lose.)

948
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,510
They are too much of a risk.

949
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,639
I can't trust them.

950
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,579
This will be risky.

951
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:15,510
- I don't like it. - Just go.

952
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,510
Go now.

953
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,050
I'm worried.

954
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,919
These two can't be trusted.

955
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,520
(Kwang Soo and So Min are getting the ingredient.)

956
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,250
Let's go get the ingredient.

957
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,490
Where is it?

958
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,720
- We're supposed to bring it here? - It's at the end of a cold road.

959
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,260
Cold and difficult.

960
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,629
That sounds suspicious.

961
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,599
(I see something over there.)

962
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,530
Can we ride it?

963
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,030
(A quest flag has been discovered.)

964
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,770
Can we ride it?

965
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,399
(Go to the end of the cold and difficult road on the sled.)

966
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,770
(So Min gets in.)

967
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,770
Let's go.

968
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,770
- I see it. - Where?

969
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,139
Over there.

970
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,149
- I see ingredients on the table. - Really?

971
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,649
- Let's go. - Is it fast?

972
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:51,649
No.

973
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,319
It's not too fast. No.

974
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,550
- It's okay. - Here we go.

975
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,649
(Let's go!)

976
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,119
It's fun!

977
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,119
Here we go.

978
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,359
It's fun!

979
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,800
- It's fun. It's so refreshing. - It is.

980
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,030
(Were you scared of the cold, difficult road?)

981
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,270
(It's actually pretty refreshing and exciting.)

982
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,500
- It's fun. - It's so refreshing.

983
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,869
It's so fun.

984
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,639
(They're already at the end of the road.)

985
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,450
It's so fast.

986
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,950
(Are we here?)

987
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,849
(They instinctively start racing.)

988
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,260
(They always compete for no reason.)

989
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,359
Wait for me.

990
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,399
- Can we eat this? - Hold on.

991
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,530
(Stop!)

992
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:43,099
- You can't eat it. - No?

993
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,829
You can't eat it. Stop.

994
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:47,040
Isn't it a mission?

995
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,339
- Please read it out loud. - It's a mission.

996
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:50,839
(A quest has been obtained.)

997
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,339
Make a decision.

998
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,950
You can either bring the ingredients to your team...

999
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,349
or eat the soup in front of you and go up a level by yourself.

1000
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
"In front of you..."

1001
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,859
(Of course, we'll eat the soup.)

1002
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,659
(Let us go up a level.)

1003
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,800
(Rice cake soup has never tasted this good.)

1004
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,629
I have no choice. I'm at level zero.

1005
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:19,540
I have no choice either. I was born this way.

1006
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
(Self-justification)

1007
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,909
(It sounds convincing because it's Kwang Soo.)

1008
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,180
How are we going to keep this a secret?

1009
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:30,309
Let's not tell them we had a choice.

1010
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,349
(He wants to pretend they had no choice.)

1011
00:33:31,349 --> 00:33:33,020
Let's tell them it just happened.

1012
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,619
I'm starting to regret my decision.

1013
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,119
Why?

1014
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,720
I feel bad.

1015
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,760
As if.

1016
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,700
(I know you too well.)

1017
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,129
(Just eat.)

1018
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,270
I'm finally back to Level One.

1019
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,270
- I'm starting over. I'm happy. - We had no choice.

1020
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,109
Anyone would have made the same decision.

1021
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,470
Of course.

1022
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,649
(They go back to the team.)

1023
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:05,050
"We had to complete a mission."

1024
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,250
I feel ashamed of myself.

1025
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,019
I can't go back.

1026
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:12,149
How do you deal with all the guilt?

1027
00:34:12,149 --> 00:34:13,760
How do you deal with it?

1028
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:16,830
To be honest, I don't feel so much guilt.

1029
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,830
Seriously. I don't.

1030
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,399
- They're going to question us. - Should we...

1031
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,600
(Rubbing)

1032
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,839
No.

1033
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,640
(So Min catches on.)

1034
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,310
What should we tell them? That we fell?

1035
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,850
Let's say they threw snow at us.

1036
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,419
Make them think it was hard.

1037
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,019
- And cold. - Yes.

1038
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,959
(The betrayer duo)

1039
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,859
(They sprinkle snow on each other.)

1040
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,689
Let's go. This should do. It's cold.

1041
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,999
Do I look innocent?

1042
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:55,729
Do I look frustrated?

1043
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,629
I can't stop smiling.

1044
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,669
Smile, and it's over.

1045
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,839
- Here they come. - Here they come.

1046
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,910
- They're plotting something. - They're whispering.

1047
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,939
They're on to something.

1048
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,410
They'll say they couldn't find it.

1049
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,910
- Welcome back. - Did you find it?

1050
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,649
(Did you find the ingredient?)

1051
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:11,950
It was like a penalty.

1052
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,280
You two were smiling so big.

1053
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,519
We had to complete a mission...

1054
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,050
But you won something, right?

1055
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,620
We had to complete a mission...

1056
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,390
But you won something, right?

1057
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,560
(Examining)

1058
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,030
- We had to... - Why are you Level Two?

1059
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,160
(Why are you Level 2?)

1060
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,129
- Really? - Really?

1061
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:29,830
- The thing is... - You ate the rice cake soup?

1062
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,129
No.

1063
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,370
(You ate the rice cake soup?)

1064
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,240
- No. - You did.

1065
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:36,740
- So Min started eating first. - Don't lie.

1066
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,140
(So Min started eating first.)

1067
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,339
- Seriously. - Why did you...

1068
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,280
dirty your hair on purpose?

1069
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,249
- Where did you eat the soup? - I didn't eat any.

1070
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,950
Then how did your level go up?

1071
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,180
I didn't eat it.

1072
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,680
You have eggs stuck in your teeth.

1073
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,189
(Stop lying.)

1074
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,189
I can see the egg yolk.

1075
00:35:51,189 --> 00:35:52,789
Isn't it over once you eat rice cake soup?

1076
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,819
What's wrong with the two of you?

1077
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,789
- What do we do with them? - It's this year's first episode.

1078
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:57,990
That's not it.

1079
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,030
It's a war now.

1080
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,399
We're going to team up.

1081
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,399
Remember that.

1082
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,999
Let's block him only.

1083
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,069
We understand.

1084
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:05,870
We'll have our eye on you and So Min.

1085
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,640
- Stop it. - How could they?

1086
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,740
This is wrong.

1087
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,640
What's next?

1088
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,039
(Peeking)

1089
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,740
(Jae Seok finds something.)

1090
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,910
(Surprised)

1091
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,850
- Is there something more? - Here it is.

1092
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,979
What is it?

1093
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:21,749
(He finds a quest.)

1094
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,950
"We prepared warm snacks for you."

1095
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,819
"Enjoy eight dumplings after determining the order of eating."

1096
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:30,129
(There's a total of 8 dumplings, 1 for each member.)

1097
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:32,859
(Eat them based on the determined order.)

1098
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,260
They're dumplings.

1099
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,030
They're steaming.

1100
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,100
Exclude these two...

1101
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,640
and play Race of Wits.

1102
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,039
- Let's determine the order. - Okay.

1103
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,269
Are you excluding the two of us?

1104
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,439
Why?

1105
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,310
- We don't have enough. - You stay out.

1106
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,339
- Go away. - You two play separately.

1107
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,709
- You two play separately. - Go away.

1108
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,479
Are you telling us to stay out of the game?

1109
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:51,649
- Go away. - Why?

1110
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:52,780
Two of you play rock-paper-scissors.

1111
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,649
- That works. - You'll be 7th and 8th.

1112
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,990
Rock-paper-scissors.

1113
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,289
(They play rock-paper-scissors.)

1114
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,959
(Kwang Soo loses.)

1115
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:02,060
Yes.

1116
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,890
- I'm seventh in place. - Don't lean forward.

1117
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,560
Don't lean forward. Stand up straight.

1118
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,030
(They play Race of Wits to determine the order.)

1119
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,100
- Start. - One.

1120
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:09,530
Two.

1121
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,899
- 3. - 4.

1122
00:37:11,669 --> 00:37:14,169
- I said four. - How could you?

1123
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:15,240
- 4. - 5.

1124
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,539
(Haha says five.)

1125
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:17,740
(Se Chan, Jae Seok, Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and Haha)

1126
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,510
No way.

1127
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,839
- This is Race of Wits. - No way.

1128
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,080
- We got it. - 3 and 4.

1129
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:23,350
- All right. - Go ahead.

1130
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,680
I bet it's delicious.

1131
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,879
It's over once you put down the chopsticks.

1132
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,379
- Okay. - When you put them down.

1133
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,249
(He tries the first dumpling.)

1134
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,319
Taste it first.

1135
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,289
Do you eat it regardless of your level?

1136
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,720
(Impressed)

1137
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,220
They look delicious.

1138
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,160
Steam is rising.

1139
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,760
Se Chan is enjoying it so much.

1140
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,430
He eats it in a cute way.

1141
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,760
- Put them down. - That's enough.

1142
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,899
Come on.

1143
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,629
- Put them down. - Okay, good job.

1144
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,970
- Put them down. - This is wrong, Se Chan.

1145
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,269
- Hey, hey. - Can't I eat...

1146
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:49,439
- You know what? - three?

1147
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:50,910
- This can happen as you eat. - Stop it.

1148
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,310
- Put them down. - That's enough.

1149
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,039
- You can't do this. - Se Chan.

1150
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,180
- Okay. - Good job.

1151
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,209
- It was the best. - He ate three.

1152
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,319
Don't go overboard, Se Chan.

1153
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,819
- It's my turn soon. - It's not you.

1154
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:01,950
You aren't third.

1155
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,289
You should be conscientious.

1156
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,260
Let's see what he does as an MC representative of Korea.

1157
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,289
Is it delicious?

1158
00:38:09,689 --> 00:38:10,830
It's steamed well.

1159
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,890
(He eats the fourth dumpling.)

1160
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,129
- They cook well. - All I need is one dumpling.

1161
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,229
Jae Seok.

1162
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:17,300
Two?

1163
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:18,899
I know how it tastes.

1164
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:19,999
Goodness.

1165
00:38:19,999 --> 00:38:21,740
He eats with gusto.

1166
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,740
- Will Haha get to eat any? - Goodness.

1167
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,870
It's really delicious.

1168
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,879
Once you eat one, you want more.

1169
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,550
It's appetizing.

1170
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,450
Will Haha get to eat any?

1171
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:34,319
Jong Kook is thinking.

1172
00:38:34,649 --> 00:38:36,390
He's like family to me.

1173
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,620
Haha's role model is Seok Jin, so just finish them.

1174
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,120
Right, he did say that.

1175
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,589
Haha kept saying that Seok Jin is his role model.

1176
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,060
- Do you want some? - Yes.

1177
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,189
Why?

1178
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,160
Jong Kook, I really want to eat it.

1179
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,229
- Jong Kook. - It's really delicious.

1180
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,470
- One won't be enough. - Of course.

1181
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,629
- Give it to me. - It isn't enough.

1182
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,470
It's so tasty.

1183
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,640
I've been good to you for 17 years.

1184
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,109
(I've been good to you for 17 years.)

1185
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,580
He's making us emotional.

1186
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,950
(Do you remember, Jong Kook?)

1187
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:07,819
(For the last 17 years,)

1188
00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:13,220
(I have always been your fan, Jong Kook.)

1189
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,060
(I'm Haha, your black cat for eternity.)

1190
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,399
- He's been his butler. - He has for a long time.

1191
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:22,600
- His butler for 17 years. - This isn't easy.

1192
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,769
There's "12 Years A Slave".

1193
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:26,970
- Being his butler for 17 years. - 17 years?

1194
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:28,569
Being his butler for 17 years isn't easy.

1195
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:29,870
- Okay. - Okay.

1196
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,539
(The 17 years of trust earned Haha a dumpling.)

1197
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,910
He's been a slave for 17 years.

1198
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:35,310
The last comment, "Butler for 17 years" was good.

1199
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080
Leave me half of it, Haha.

1200
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,950
How can I leave half?

1201
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,819
Remember us in Mapo-gu?

1202
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:43,149
(Remember our time in Mapo-gu.)

1203
00:39:43,149 --> 00:39:44,149
- Haha. - Ji Hyo.

1204
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:45,249
Think hard.

1205
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,819
(Ji Hyo)

1206
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,859
I'm moving.

1207
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:49,930
(There's no more Mapo-gu.)

1208
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,060
(Haha finishes the last dumpling.)

1209
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,200
He's moving.

1210
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,660
He finished the last one.

1211
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,030
That was clean.

1212
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:57,169
Isn't it delicious?

1213
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,629
These dumplings are excellent.

1214
00:39:59,129 --> 00:40:00,870
They're really good.

1215
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,899
We finished everything.

1216
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,910
(Rice cake soup siblings are hungry.)

1217
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,310
- These dumplings are excellent. - There's galbi inside.

1218
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,039
- They're so good. - Where are they from?

1219
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,879
(Sniffing)

1220
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:10,680
- Look at her. - I'm smelling them.

1221
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,379
(I want to smell them at least.)

1222
00:40:12,379 --> 00:40:13,950
(Do you want to smell them too?)

1223
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,249
- They must be galbi dumplings. - These are good dumplings.

1224
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,050
(Are we only eating dumplings?)

1225
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,120
Is there something more?

1226
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,519
(There must be something now that the quest is over.)

1227
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,459
Is there something underneath? Open this up.

1228
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,530
- There's nothing. - There's nothing.

1229
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,229
(Is there something?)

1230
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:27,859
What is it?

1231
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:28,899
Here it is again.

1232
00:40:28,899 --> 00:40:29,899
- What is it? - Really?

1233
00:40:29,899 --> 00:40:31,569
"Two people to find rice cake soup ingredients".

1235
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,240
(Pick two members to find rice cake soup ingredients.)

1236
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,510
(The one who had the most dumplings and a member of his choice)

1237
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,979
"The one who had the most dumplings"...

1238
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,080
"and a member of his choice"?

1239
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,810
It's Se Chan.

1240
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,450
(Let's go, Se Chan.)

1241
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,680
- Se Chan. - Wait.

1242
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,519
- Haha is so sly. - Se Chan.

1243
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:51,019
I should have eaten more.

1244
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:53,089
I should have finished all four.

1245
00:40:53,089 --> 00:40:55,959
I didn't get to eat rice cake soup or dumplings.

1246
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,830
- Look at me. - This is impossible.

1247
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,729
There's no way to go.

1248
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,260
The one who talked badly about my hair...

1249
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,169
during the opening segment can go to the back of the line.

1250
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,899
Se Chan, it wasn't me.

1251
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,269
Jae Seok started it.

1252
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,300
Jong Kook started it first.

1253
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,800
Keep down my hair with a few grains of rice?

1254
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:10,740
Keep down my hair with a few grains of rice?

1255
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,209
It was definitely Jae Seok.

1256
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:13,740
Jae Seok said it.

1257
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,010
(Goodness)

1258
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,180
- I said you looked cute. - I said it looks good on you.

1259
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,910
- I said that you looked cute. - I know how to get there.

1260
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,620
- You and I are butlers. - Se Chan.

1261
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:23,919
- Let's work together. - Butlers should stick together.

1262
00:41:23,919 --> 00:41:25,419
- Look carefully. - Number one.

1263
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,419
Why aren't you doing anything?

1264
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,830
- Jong Kook. - Aren't you going?

1265
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,330
I teased him a lot about his hair during the opening.

1266
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:34,100
Why did you?

1267
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,499
Okay, I made my decision.

1268
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:38,499
- Let's go, Se Chan. - I'm going to lose my mind.

1269
00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:39,870
- Haha. - That's right.

1270
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,740
(He picks Haha.)

1271
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,439
- Haha. Ji Hyo, I had no choice. - Let's go.

1272
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,839
- Let's go together. - Gosh, Se Chan.

1273
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,109
- Haha is a wrong choice. - It's Haha.

1274
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:50,109
- Se Chan. - We can win.

1275
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:51,379
I hope you choose wisely.

1276
00:41:51,379 --> 00:41:54,649
We need to find everything before going back home.

1277
00:41:54,649 --> 00:41:56,419
- You can't sacrifice the group. - Right.

1278
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,220
- Okay. - We have to collect ingredients.

1279
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,660
- Let's go. - Se Chan.

1280
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,620
You must look far to become a bird.

1281
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,589
Don't lose sight of the forest for the trees.

1282
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,689
(The butler brothers go find rice cake soup ingredients.)

1283
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,729
Where shall we go?

1284
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:08,859
- Thank you, Se Chan. - You're welcome.

1285
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,370
Teamwork is important.

1286
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,200
You know what to do, right?

1287
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:14,240
- Let's go level up. - We just go level up.

1288
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,669
(Forget about finding ingredients.)

1289
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,379
- Let's have some rice cake soup. - If I could,

1290
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,379
I'd give you my level.

1291
00:42:22,379 --> 00:42:24,280
We should advance together.

1292
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,479
What's the point of doing it alone?

1293
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,850
- Are we searching again? - Goodness.

1294
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:31,519
Let us eat some rice cake soup too.

1295
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:34,589
(They need to find the ingredients in order to level up.)

1296
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,459
Hey, there's something.

1297
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,490
- What is it? - There's an R flag.

1298
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,600
Is it here already?

1299
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,970
(Follow the R mark.)

1300
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,569
- I think we have to go upstairs. - Is it here?

1301
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:45,669
Go upstairs?

1302
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:46,740
I think we go upstairs.

1303
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,399
- Look, there's another R. - Go upstairs.

1304
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,539
You're right.

1305
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:52,609
(The members follow the R and go to the second floor.)

1306
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:53,910
- What? - What's going on?

1307
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,280
(Jae Seok is startled by something.)

1308
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,550
Who is it?

1309
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,379
(What is waiting for them?)

1310
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:04,089
(Who are the mysterious women with their backs turned?)

1311
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,319
(Quest fairies have been discovered.)

1312
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,990
(It's Apink.)

1313
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,560
(Quest fairies of charisma return to Running Man.)

1314
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,729
What brings them here?

1315
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,700
What brings them here?

1316
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,700
(They attract the crowd with their new song "Percent".)

1317
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,039
(They will help the members for their quests.)

1318
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,339
Say hello.

1319
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,810
What's going on?

1320
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:27,979
Hello, Bo Mi.

1321
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:29,810
What's going on?

1322
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:31,350
What brings you here?

1323
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:34,080
- Hello. - What brings you here?

1324
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,550
- Hello. - What brings them here?

1325
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,189
I thought there were name tags.

1326
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,519
Congratulations.

1327
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:40,819
Your level went up.

1328
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,260
(Congratulations, your level went up.)

1329
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,089
(Their level went up?)

1330
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,729
As you found us,

1331
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,100
your level went up.

1332
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,470
We leveled up?

1333
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:52,830
- Really? - Is it true?

1334
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,470
- Did our level go up? - How?

1335
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,140
- Okay. - Congratulations.

1336
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,339
I'm Level Three.

1337
00:43:57,339 --> 00:43:58,370
I'm Level Two.

1338
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,140
(The six members level up.)

1339
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,939
Why did we level up?

1340
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:02,979
What about...

1341
00:44:02,979 --> 00:44:05,379
- Haha and Se Chan? What about them? - Will they miss it?

1342
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,550
(What about Haha and Se Chan?)

1343
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,749
(They're excited.)

1344
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:13,160
Level up.

1345
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,990
- You two. - Yes?

1346
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,390
Among the ingredients, you gained a pot.

1347
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,899
Take the pot and return to the restaurant.

1348
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,330
Why?

1349
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:24,470
What about the level-up?

1350
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:25,769
Your level...

1351
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,999
will not go up.

1352
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,800
(Your level will not go up.)

1353
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,010
I came here for the level-up.

1354
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:34,240
Those who left were greedy.

1355
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,879
So the rest of you will level up.

1356
00:44:35,879 --> 00:44:37,810
(The butler brothers fail to raise their level.)

1357
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,149
Is that why our level went up?

1358
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:43,749
"Couple up with the quest fairies."

1359
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,220
"Only couples may participate in the next quest."

1360
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,890
"When couples are determined,"

1361
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,089
"you're given a chance to earn ingredients and raise your level."

1362
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:51,589
"Those who left to get ingredients are a couple automatically."

1363
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,859
The two of them are a couple.

1364
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:54,229
We choose couples among us.

1365
00:44:54,229 --> 00:44:55,999
(The members couple up with the quest fairies.)

1366
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,129
- Do we take it? - Yes.

1367
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:00,439
- Go back to the restaurant. - Wait.

1368
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:02,200
(They earn a pot among 8 ingredients.)

1369
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:04,269
This is unfair.

1370
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,839
You should have told us.

1371
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:09,109
(The butler brothers earn a pot.)

1372
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:12,310
It's our first time having the entire group...

1373
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,620
- of Apink. - It's the first time.

1374
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,519
- Right. - We invited members separately.

1375
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,890
- We never had the entire group. - Really?

1376
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,890
Here's what's more surprising.

1377
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,120
I haven't seen Bo Mi sing in a long time.

1378
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,629
(Bo Mi sings.)

1379
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:26,560
Every time she came, she gave us low kicks.

1380
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,200
(Bo Mi usually gave low kicks.)

1381
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:32,229
(She kicks every time she comes.)

1382
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,169
(When Bo Mi kicks, the knees get bent.)

1383
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:40,109
(She's the queen of low kicks.)

1384
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:42,580
Bo Mi, you got leaner.

1385
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,050
You surprised me, Bo Mi.

1386
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,050
- Is it because she lost weight? - Don't I look weak?

1387
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,680
You look out of it.

1388
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,379
You should sit, Bo Mi.

1389
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,720
- Are you okay? - Sit down for a while.

1390
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,589
She looks so weak.

1391
00:45:53,589 --> 00:45:55,789
I don't think her low kicks will hurt anymore.

1392
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:58,760
(He provokes her all of a sudden.)

1393
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,060
- Is that a challenge? - I bet they won't hurt.

1394
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,100
Take a challenge.

1395
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,499
- I can handle her low kicks. - I don't think they'll hurt.

1396
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:08,370
Her legs are so thin now.

1397
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,740
I'm still strong.

1398
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,169
Give it a try, Seok Jin.

1399
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:12,609
I got kicked many times.

1400
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:14,640
(Flinching)

1401
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,479
You got kicked before, so you can compare them.

1402
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:19,479
You will know the difference.

1403
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,189
I'm sorry, but the top of your foot may hurt.

1404
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:24,589
I got stronger.

1405
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:26,859
(He gets pretentious.)

1406
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:28,760
- Don't strain yourself, Bo Mi. - Shall I kick?

1407
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,430
(I'm ready.)

1408
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:35,499
(He's no longer scared of Bo Mi's low kicks.)

1409
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:39,100
(Thud)

1410
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,669
(Startled)

1411
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:43,269
That must've hurt a lot.

1412
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:44,970
(The sound is very clear.)

1413
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:46,310
(Groaning in pain)

1414
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,209
(He slaps the floor three times.)

1415
00:46:48,209 --> 00:46:49,240
Poor Seok Jin.

1416
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,510
My gosh, I'm always kicking you.

1417
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,979
- Goodness. - How is it?

1418
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:53,620
Has her kick changed?

1419
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:56,249
(Not one bit.)

1420
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,689
- Is it the same? - I said I didn't want to.

1421
00:46:58,689 --> 00:46:59,789
It hurts more.

1422
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:01,819
Bo Mi's still got it.

1423
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,359
(Everyone celebrates.)

1424
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,530
We should congratulate her.

1425
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:09,260
(The queen of low kicks is eternal.)

1426
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,300
(It's okay.)

1427
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,330
I'm okay.

1428
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,870
This is great.

1429
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:15,899
- This is great. - It's fun.

1430
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:18,240
(Couples)

1431
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,910
(Jae Seok and Cho Rong, Seok Jin and Nam Joo,)

1432
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:21,379
(Jong Kook and Na Eun, Haha and Se Chan)

1433
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,280
What's this?

1434
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:25,280
(A quest has been discovered.)

1435
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,850
(It's a quest for couples.)

1436
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,019
- What is it? - "Feed with the Wind".

1437
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,789
"Feed with the Wind".

1438
00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:35,720
Seven couples work together on a quest.

1439
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,330
When successful, you earn an ingredient.

1440
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,060
Couples play in a relay.

1441
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,430
One person eats food that swings from the opposite end.

1442
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,169
All couples must eat everything in 100 seconds to succeed.

1443
00:47:44,169 --> 00:47:46,640
(A quest is successful when they eat all in 100 seconds.)

1444
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,769
The one with a hole isn't easy to eat.

1445
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:52,769
It's possible to do it.

1446
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:54,280
- Nam Joo. - Yes?

1447
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:55,839
Don't disappoint me.

1448
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,510
(Laughing)

1449
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,180
- Haha, we're first. - We'll finish fast.

1450
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:01,950
You must finish under 100 seconds.

1451
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:03,050
We will only take three seconds.

1452
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,089
Get ready.

1453
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,089
We will only take three seconds.

1454
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:06,819
Get ready, set.

1455
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,859
(The game starts.)

1456
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:14,859
(Haha fetches the fruit as soon as the game starts.)

1457
00:48:15,899 --> 00:48:17,830
(Will they succeed as soon as they get started?)

1458
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,640
(What will be the result?)

1459
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:21,719
Set.

1460
00:48:22,348 --> 00:48:23,958
(The game starts.)

1461
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,329
(Will they succeed
as soon as they get started?)

1462
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:30,228
(Unfortunately they fail.)

1463
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:31,228
It isn't done yet.

1464
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:32,359
No.

1465
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:34,169
(They could have succeeded
in one go.)

1466
00:48:34,169 --> 00:48:35,199
- No.
- Haha.

1467
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,769
(Catch, Haha.)

1468
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:38,839
(He's so close.)

1469
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:39,899
Come on.

1470
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:41,240
- He got it. - Okay.

1471
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,510
(They finally succeed.)

1472
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,039
(They succeed in 15 seconds.)

1473
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:45,209
- He got it. - Okay.

1474
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:46,410
That was great.

1475
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,310
(Next are Ji Hyo and Ha Young.)

1476
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,050
- Send it far. - Move the chairs.

1477
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:51,180
- Send it far. - Far?

1478
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,620
(She blows it far.)

1479
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,450
- 100 seconds. - Move the chairs.

1480
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:58,289
(It's close to her mouth.)

1481
00:48:58,789 --> 00:48:59,890
100 seconds.

1482
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:01,260
Just a little bit more.

1483
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,390
- 100 seconds. - Blow.

1484
00:49:02,859 --> 00:49:04,260
One more time. Blow.

1485
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,729
(She blows lightly.)

1486
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,370
(She got it in her mouth.)

1487
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,800
(It comes back out.)

1488
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:11,839
100 seconds. That's right.

1489
00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:13,769
(Ji Hyo and Ha Young succeed easily.)

1490
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:15,910
- Okay. - They got it.

1491
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,140
- Let's go. - Go.

1492
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,580
- Okay. - They got it.

1493
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,740
That was great.

1494
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,810
Blow it far.

1495
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:21,910
- Make it far. - Blow.

1496
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,780
- It's moving. - Hey, hey.

1497
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,419
You have to blow it, Kwang Soo.

1498
00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:26,680
Blow it.

1499
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,019
- You have to blow it. - Kwang Soo.

1500
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:29,819
(Why can't you grab it when you have a big mouth?)

1501
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:31,120
This is a problem.

1502
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,890
(His mouth is big.)

1503
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,160
(However, the snack is also huge.)

1504
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,359
- It's a problem. - Kwang Soo.

1505
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:39,200
(The snack hits his front tooth.)

1506
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:43,800
(We can hear the sound of friction.)

1507
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,539
(Poor Kwang Soo.)

1508
00:49:47,169 --> 00:49:48,569
(Kwang Soo's tooth got hit.)

1509
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,769
He got hit in his tooth.

1510
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:51,209
- Gosh. - Kwang Soo.

1511
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:52,879
- You have to bite, Kwang Soo. - You can do it.

1512
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:54,140
- You can do it. - Blow it.

1513
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,580
Eun Ji, blow it for him.

1514
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,379
- Blow it hard one more time. - Kwang Soo.

1515
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,379
You have to bite, Kwang Soo.

1516
00:49:59,379 --> 00:50:00,419
Kwang Soo.

1517
00:50:00,419 --> 00:50:02,390
(It's about to go in.)

1518
00:50:02,589 --> 00:50:04,990
(He barely succeeds by biting with his front teeth.)

1519
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:07,019
(Kwang Soo and Eun Ji succeed.)

1520
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:08,689
- Great. - Okay.

1521
00:50:09,189 --> 00:50:10,729
- Go. - Who's next?

1522
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:12,859
- Move. - Who's next?

1523
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,100
We got it.

1524
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,229
We have 100 seconds.

1525
00:50:16,229 --> 00:50:17,970
We got it. This one is difficult.

1526
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:19,569
- No. - Bo Mi.

1527
00:50:19,569 --> 00:50:21,399
- She can't even reach it. - Bo Mi.

1528
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:22,569
(She can't reach it.)

1529
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:24,039
Change the position.

1530
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,979
- That won't work. - Bo Mi can't do it.

1531
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:27,080
(She can't even get close.)

1532
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,180
- Bo Mi. - She can't reach it.

1533
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,979
Why are you twisting your back? Straighten your back.

1534
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,419
Straighten your back.

1535
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:34,319
- Straighten your back. - Straighten up.

1536
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,789
- Bo Mi. - Come on.

1537
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,220
Bo Mi.

1538
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,589
Straighten your back.

1539
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:39,990
- Sit up. - Straighten your back.

1540
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,359
Bo Mi.

1541
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,890
So Min, eat it for her.

1542
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,289
- Change seats. - Bo Mi.

1543
00:50:44,289 --> 00:50:46,229
Change seats, and blow it, Bo Mi.

1544
00:50:46,229 --> 00:50:47,499
- Go. - That's better.

1545
00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:48,499
She can reach it.

1546
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:49,669
So Min's sitting height is tall.

1547
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:51,430
(Jong Kook is relieved.)

1548
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:55,039
(Her sitting height is as tall as Han Gi Beom's.)

1549
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:56,069
(She's working hard with her tall sitting height.)

1550
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:57,370
Eat it now.

1551
00:50:57,669 --> 00:50:59,109
Come on.

1552
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:00,479
- She almost got it. - Come on.

1553
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,539
So Min.

1554
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,410
(Bo Mi blows it, and So Min opens her mouth.)

1555
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:05,479
Gosh, Bo Mi.

1556
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,879
- So Min. - Lower yourself.

1557
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,979
You can do it.

1558
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:09,149
It's frustrating to watch.

1559
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,390
It's frustrating.

1560
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:11,450
Lower yourself.

1561
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,589
So Min.

1562
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:13,890
(It's so frustrating to watch.)

1563
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:15,530
It's frustrating.

1564
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,330
You won't make it.

1565
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,300
- Move. - Blow it.

1566
00:51:20,229 --> 00:51:21,359
So Min.

1567
00:51:21,499 --> 00:51:22,870
Blow harder, Bo Mi.

1568
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,870
It's over with this couple.

1569
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,039
So Min.

1570
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,709
- Goodness. - Just give up.

1571
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:29,769
(Time is up.)

1572
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:31,039
What happened?

1573
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:32,240
Why can't you do it?

1574
00:51:32,379 --> 00:51:33,879
- My neck hurts. - You couldn't reach it, right?

1575
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:36,280
- No. - You should try with the long one.

1576
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,209
The two of them took a difficult one.

1577
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:40,419
Do you want to switch? This one is easier.

1578
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,089
So Min and Bo Mi should take the long one.

1579
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,490
Who wants to take this one?

1580
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,089
- Anything is fine. - Who wants this?

1581
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:50,830
Inevitably, one of us has to level down.

1582
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:53,930
Including Apink members...

1583
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:55,030
Stop it.

1584
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:56,269
(Let's play with Apink members.)

1585
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:57,370
(Stop it.)

1586
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,999
That's enough.

1587
00:51:59,899 --> 00:52:01,709
He loves wits too much.

1588
00:52:01,709 --> 00:52:02,870
Let's play Race of Wits.

1589
00:52:03,169 --> 00:52:04,269
- Start. - One.

1590
00:52:04,669 --> 00:52:05,709
- 2. - 2.

1591
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:09,749
(Jae Seok, Kwang Soo, and So Min)

1592
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:11,350
Please come out.

1593
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:14,249
- 1. - 2.

1594
00:52:14,249 --> 00:52:15,419
- 3. - 3.

1595
00:52:17,189 --> 00:52:18,419
Let's play again.

1596
00:52:18,419 --> 00:52:19,689
Please.

1597
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,620
Please let me win once.

1598
00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:23,030
I'm almost there.

1599
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,530
- Start. - One.

1600
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,800
(It's the last round.)

1601
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,129
- 2. - 2.

1602
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,800
Jae Seok.

1603
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,700
Gosh, you have no wits.

1604
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,069
- You play rock-paper-scissors. - Right.

1605
00:52:33,069 --> 00:52:34,470
- Let's play 1 round. - 1 round.

1606
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:35,709
Get ready.

1607
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,209
Rock-paper-scissors.

1608
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:40,240
(The loser in this round gets his level lowered.)

1609
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,950
(Will it be Kwang Soo who's currently in the lead?)

1610
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,350
(Will Jae Seok be the last with Seok Jin?)

1611
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:47,180
(Kwang Soo wins.)

1612
00:52:47,919 --> 00:52:50,149
Gosh, Jae Seok always loses.

1613
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:51,720
(Jae Seok's level is lowered.)

1614
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,819
I know.

1615
00:52:52,959 --> 00:52:54,260
Your level goes down.

1616
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:55,990
Kwang Soo.

1617
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,260
- He's at Level 3. - You're Level 1.

1618
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:59,629
You're the last.

1619
00:53:00,629 --> 00:53:01,930
You're the last of the last.

1620
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:06,740
(Jae Seok's level is lowered from 2 to 1.)

1621
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,169
Countdown for 100 seconds starts.

1622
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:10,539
Get ready.

1623
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,780
Set.

1624
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,080
(Will they succeed this time?)

1625
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,810
(Their second attempt starts.)

1626
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,850
Blow it smoothly.

1627
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,189
- You need to hurry. - So Min is good at catching.

1628
00:53:22,189 --> 00:53:23,490
We're almost there.

1629
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:25,819
- Hey, suck it in. - Goodness.

1630
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,160
This shouldn't take so long.

1631
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:31,030
(They're very slow.)

1632
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,999
(Please, So Min.)

1633
00:53:33,229 --> 00:53:35,830
(Will they succeed this time?)

1634
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:37,569
So Min, that's it.

1635
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,669
(She finally ate it.)

1636
00:53:39,669 --> 00:53:41,470
- Okay. - Next couple should sit.

1637
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:42,510
Go.

1638
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,209
Suck it like a vacuum.

1639
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,839
Eat it in one go.

1640
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,010
Grab it first with the lips.

1641
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,709
- Use the lips. - Eat it in one go.

1642
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,249
(Jong Kook nags and Ha Young blows it.)

1643
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:53,580
(She catches it.)

1644
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:54,950
Okay, that was good.

1645
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,220
- Let's go. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

1646
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,859
(Kwang Soo's team succeeds immediately.)

1647
00:53:59,189 --> 00:54:01,760
(He takes it as Eun Ji blows on it.)

1648
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:03,959
(He ate it right away.)

1649
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:05,030
That was good.

1650
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,530
(The fourth one is the most difficult.)

1651
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,129
Suck it in.

1652
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:12,899
Haha.

1653
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,069
(Flapping)

1654
00:54:15,069 --> 00:54:17,010
You must do it quickly.

1655
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,209
- Hey. - Grab it first with the lips.

1656
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,539
Grab with the lips.

1657
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:22,450
(The snack moves too quickly.)

1658
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,450
Goodness.

1659
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,979
(Please let me eat it.)

1660
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,149
Push it.

1661
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:28,589
(Se Chan does it right away.)

1662
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:30,589
(If you tell me to push it,)

1663
00:54:30,589 --> 00:54:31,990
(I'll push it.)

1664
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,189
Okay, we got it.

1665
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,919
(He takes the problematic snack...)

1666
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:36,589
(and pushes it with his lips.)

1667
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:37,589
(Everyone is shocked.)

1668
00:54:37,589 --> 00:54:39,760
We got it. No, my lips didn't touch his.

1669
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,999
They didn't touch.

1670
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:42,569
They didn't touch.

1671
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:43,669
Go.

1672
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:46,970
(Jong Kook and Na Eun try the fifth one.)

1673
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,839
- You got it. - That's good.

1674
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:53,140
Okay. Good. All right.

1675
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,910
Cho Rong!

1676
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:55,950
We can do it.

1677
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:57,180
(There are only two snacks left.)

1678
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,280
Blow it. Hurry.

1679
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,280
No, that's too strong.

1680
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,749
(She blows too hard.)

1681
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:05,959
(Despite that...)

1682
00:55:05,959 --> 00:55:07,959
(He almost had it!)

1683
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:10,330
Put your tongue through it.

1684
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,260
(Biting)

1685
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,260
All right!

1686
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,499
(Thanks to his protruding lips, he gets it.)

1687
00:55:14,499 --> 00:55:16,229
We're almost there.

1688
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,939
(There's only one left.)

1689
00:55:20,169 --> 00:55:22,069
We got it! Last one!

1690
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:24,039
- Last one! - 20 seconds.

1691
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:25,039
(Can they finish on time and obtain the ingredients?)

1692
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,310
- Seok Jin. - Come on.

1693
00:55:26,379 --> 00:55:28,140
- She can't reach. - Nam Joo.

1694
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:30,010
You have to eat it, Seok Jin! She can't reach.

1695
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,580
(Nam Joo can't reach. You have to eat it, Seok Jin!)

1696
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,120
- Switch seats. - You have to eat it, Seok Jin!

1697
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,550
- Switch seats. - Switch seats.

1698
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,249
Nam Joo has to blow it.

1699
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,249
There's no time!

1700
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,160
Eat it.

1701
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,959
It's too strong.

1702
00:55:40,959 --> 00:55:42,859
- It's too strong. - Gently.

1703
00:55:42,859 --> 00:55:44,260
Smoothly!

1704
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,760
You can do it!

1705
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,499
(There's no time left. Can they succeed?)

1706
00:55:47,499 --> 00:55:49,569
(Biting)

1707
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:53,140
(They complete the quest on time.)

1708
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:54,169
He did it!

1709
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:56,839
(We did it!)

1710
00:55:57,939 --> 00:56:00,180
(They obtained a portable burner out of 8 ingredients.)

1711
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:01,339
We did it!

1712
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,479
(Portable burner)

1713
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,120
A quest has been discovered.

1714
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,490
Hoodie Link Between Us.

1715
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,459
"This is a couples' match to reach the next level."

1716
00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:20,359
"Tie yours and your opponents' hoodies together,"

1717
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,999
"and the team that can guess the letter..."

1718
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:24,700
"on the opponents' head first wins."

1719
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:27,700
If you play against Jong Kook, you won't be able to see.

1720
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,470
- This... - You won't be able to see.

1721
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,839
I want to avoid Jong Kook.

1722
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:33,740
He might not be able to see well.

1723
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:34,740
(He has small eyes.)

1724
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
There's a team that'll advance by default.

1725
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,850
Let's pick one and go ahead.

1726
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,289
Is something wrong?

1727
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:44,350
- No. - Are you in a good mood?

1728
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,289
Are you in a bad mood because you are Level One?

1729
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:48,589
- Don't get me wrong. - Excuse me.

1730
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,189
- Are you getting annoyed? - Are you?

1731
00:56:50,189 --> 00:56:51,589
I'm not.

1732
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:53,859
- I know what that's like. - I'm not.

1733
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:55,499
- Is this it? - You're mistaken.

1734
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,569
- You're mistaken. - Am I?

1735
00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:01,100
It feels like he's annoyed.

1736
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:03,569
- Then... - We'll pick first.

1737
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:05,839
- Pick one. - No, Haha.

1738
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,339
- This one. - Are you sure?

1739
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:08,810
- This one. - Okay.

1740
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,649
Take it. In 1, 2, 3. Show us.

1741
00:57:10,649 --> 00:57:12,550
- I'm 100 percent sure. - Show us right away.

1742
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,450
(Is this the default win?)

1743
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:16,490
- In 1, 2, 3. - It's blank.

1744
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,760
(It's a blank card.)

1745
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:22,129
All right. Pick one, Cho Rong.

1746
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:23,729
- Please take one. - It's 1 out of 6.

1747
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:24,729
(Jae Seok and Cho Rong are next.)

1748
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:26,459
Isn't it better to go first?

1749
00:57:26,459 --> 00:57:29,430
- It is. - That's not possible.

1750
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:30,430
It's not.

1751
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,370
(What card did Cho Rong pick?)

1752
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:36,370
(Darn it.)

1753
00:57:36,539 --> 00:57:38,109
Here.

1754
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:40,439
(It's not a default win.)

1755
00:57:40,439 --> 00:57:42,149
- "Darn it"? - What did you say?

1756
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:43,479
She's competitive.

1757
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:44,550
Pick one, Na Eun.

1758
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:47,649
We already did two teams, so I'll move to the other side.

1759
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:50,850
(He changes the order all of a sudden.)

1760
00:57:51,919 --> 00:57:53,260
What are you doing?

1761
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,720
That's being annoying.

1762
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,859
- I agree. - We did two teams on that side.

1763
00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:58,430
- Right? - Yes.

1764
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:00,459
That's being annoying.

1765
00:58:00,459 --> 00:58:01,530
(Hold on.)

1766
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:02,930
- No? - No.

1767
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,169
- I'm not. - Okay.

1768
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,569
- I'll keep an eye on you. - Pick one.

1769
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,709
- Which one do you want to pick? - This one.

1770
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:13,439
(This one.)

1771
00:58:13,439 --> 00:58:15,310
This one? Then I'll pick something else.

1772
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:16,709
(Kwang Soo is unlucky.)

1773
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:17,850
(What card did she pick?)

1774
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,149
Okay. What is it, Eun Ji?

1775
00:58:20,149 --> 00:58:22,189
(What card did she pick?)

1776
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:23,749
(It's still a blank card.)

1777
00:58:23,749 --> 00:58:25,959
Get out.

1778
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:28,060
Okay. Good.

1779
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,830
- Please, Bo Mi. - Can we pick at the same time?

1780
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,430
Bo Mi. Feel it.

1781
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,459
- Can you feel it? - Yes.

1782
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,729
(This is it.)

1783
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:39,700
- Please. - In 1, 2, 3.

1784
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,700
(Did Bo Mi feel something?)

1785
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,310
(The result is...)

1786
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,640
(a dud.)

1787
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,740
Okay!

1788
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,010
(All 4 cards so far were blank. There are 3 cards left.)

1789
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,839
That was close. There are three left.

1790
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,580
Okay. Come back here.

1791
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:53,919
You did 2 here and 2 there, so you have to come back.

1792
00:58:53,919 --> 00:58:55,379
- No, no. - Sir?

1793
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:58,289
- Hold on. - We need a moment, sir.

1794
00:58:58,289 --> 00:58:59,720
- Sir. - Kwang Soo.

1795
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,959
(Jae Seok gets dragged to the corner.)

1796
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,859
Where are you going, Jae Seok?

1797
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,129
(This is the end of the annoying one.)

1798
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,729
Hold on. We can talk, but don't get away from the cameras.

1799
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:09,999
I'm doing that on purpose.

1800
00:59:09,999 --> 00:59:12,539
(I'm doing that on purpose.)

1801
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:13,640
(They're already at the end.)

1802
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,039
Don't get away from the cameras. Hey!

1803
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:16,640
(What do I do now?)

1804
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:18,839
(He puts up a fight.)

1805
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,479
- Get me on the camera! - No...

1806
00:59:20,479 --> 00:59:21,939
(Help me.)

1807
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:23,479
- Why are you taking me there? - But why?

1808
00:59:23,479 --> 00:59:25,350
- You did 2 and 2, so come back. - Watch.

1809
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:26,649
- Listen to me. - Okay, I will.

1810
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:29,149
Listen. I did 2 and 2, right?

1811
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,459
I did 2 and 2, so 1 person from each team...

1812
00:59:33,459 --> 00:59:35,589
(There are three teams left.)

1813
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:37,189
- Pick. - We can do that.

1814
00:59:37,189 --> 00:59:39,129
- I'll pick. - Okay.

1815
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,660
All right. You pick, Na Eun.

1816
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,729
I think it's us.

1817
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:43,729
- Right? - Yes.

1818
00:59:43,729 --> 00:59:45,100
- I feel that way too. - Right?

1819
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:48,740
- This one. - Show us.

1820
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,939
(They picked their cards.)

1821
00:59:51,569 --> 00:59:53,580
In 1, 2, 3.

1822
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:54,580
(Who's the lucky one with the default win?)

1823
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,649
(It's Na Eun.)

1824
00:59:56,649 --> 00:59:57,709
It's us.

1825
00:59:58,749 --> 01:00:01,249
(Jong Kook and Na Eun advance to the semifinal.)

1826
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:04,319
I told you it's us. All right!

1827
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,390
They're so lucky.

1828
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,560
Jae Seok, you should have gone in the right order.

1829
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,560
Why did you change it?

1830
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,330
You can't be annoying all of a sudden.

1831
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:15,260
(The default win has been decided. The list of matches will be given.)

1832
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,530
- This is how the world is. - This is how the world is.

1833
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,439
Na Eun's got the lucky touch.

1834
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:21,839
(Hoodie Link Between Us)

1835
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,339
First contestants, please come on out.

1836
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,010
- For the first match... - Then we'll just face Seok Jin.

1837
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:29,550
Okay. Seok Jin versus Haha.

1838
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:31,609
- No. - Seok Jin versus Haha.

1839
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:33,120
Nam Joo as well.

1840
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,490
It'll be a sweet win. It'll be sweet.

1841
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:38,390
This might as well be a default win.

1842
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,660
- Put this on. - Tie it for each other.

1843
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,890
- Do we tie it? - Tie it for each other.

1844
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:44,789
I won't be soft.

1845
01:00:44,859 --> 01:00:46,760
- This is a game. - Nam Joo, you have to win.

1846
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,660
I think I'll laugh.

1847
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,430
What did you say?

1848
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,200
What do you mean you'll laugh?

1849
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,339
(This will be fun.)

1850
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:56,039
All right.

1851
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,539
- It's on the side. - It goes on the side?

1852
01:00:58,539 --> 01:01:01,740
(They have to guess the letter on the opponent's head.)

1853
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:02,950
Is it on the left?

1854
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:05,749
- You can't see that. - It goes on the side?

1855
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,350
It's harder to see.

1856
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:10,149
- If you know the answer, yell out. - Okay.

1857
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:12,260
- Ready, - Haha, you have to look at mine.

1858
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,660
- set... - This is going to be so hard.

1859
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,760
I know.

1860
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,999
If you pull, you can't see either one.

1861
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:22,129
(They lose their sight.)

1862
01:01:22,129 --> 01:01:23,470
Pull and let go.

1863
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:25,300
You have to pull and let go.

1864
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:28,240
- Se Chan can't look at Nam Joo's. - You can't see.

1865
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,010
I can't see at all.

1866
01:01:30,010 --> 01:01:31,310
(What's that?)

1867
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,539
(Floundering)

1868
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:34,209
I can't see.

1869
01:01:34,209 --> 01:01:35,379
I can see now.

1870
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,050
I can see.

1871
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:39,850
Hold on.

1872
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,450
(Peeking)

1873
01:01:43,089 --> 01:01:44,319
Mine.

1874
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,660
(Haha sees Seok Jin's letter.)

1875
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:48,390
Hey, this is it.

1876
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:51,129
(They have to see Nam Joo's now.)

1877
01:01:51,629 --> 01:01:54,959
(He checks hers as well through a small opening.)

1878
01:01:54,959 --> 01:01:56,569
Hey. Answer!

1879
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,300
- Answer! - "Bang Mok".

1880
01:01:59,939 --> 01:02:01,370
- What? - "Bang Mok".

1881
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,569
(He's correct.)

1882
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:03,609
- Okay! - Yes!

1883
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,339
(Haha and Se Chan advance to the semifinal.)

1884
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:06,839
If you pull on this, you can't see anything.

1885
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:08,280
I saw through a gap.

1886
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:11,450
Next, Ha Young and Ji Hyo...

1887
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,479
versus Bo Mi and So Min.

1888
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,950
This is hard.

1889
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,720
- This is the second match. - Right.

1890
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,220
Please put your heads down.

1891
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,720
So Min and Ji Hyo.

1892
01:02:21,319 --> 01:02:22,990
They haven't faced each other that many times.

1893
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,859
I think they're competitive.

1894
01:02:24,859 --> 01:02:26,129
("Ah Ram" and "Go Sat")

1895
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:28,560
I think So Min will get dragged around.

1896
01:02:28,729 --> 01:02:29,830
I'm curious.

1897
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,999
(Staring contest)

1898
01:02:30,999 --> 01:02:32,439
(She's intimidated.)

1899
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:36,240
(They had a headbutting match going on.)

1900
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,939
(It's fierce.)

1901
01:02:37,939 --> 01:02:39,010
Are you sure?

1902
01:02:40,109 --> 01:02:41,640
Ha Young is strong, right?

1903
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,749
- Right? - It's a close call.

1904
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:45,979
Bo Mi is really strong too.

1905
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,649
- Those two are the strongest. - Let's go.

1906
01:02:49,189 --> 01:02:50,220
Ready,

1907
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,019
set...

1908
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,319
(The game starts.)

1909
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,459
It's "Ah" here.

1910
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:58,589
(As soon as they start,)

1911
01:02:58,589 --> 01:03:01,300
(Ha Young sees her letter.)

1912
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,729
It's "Ah" here.

1913
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,629
(Ha Young is incredible.)

1914
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:09,010
(Meanwhile, the other ones...)

1915
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:10,910
(Peekaboo)

1916
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,640
(They are intense in their own way.)

1917
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,680
Ji Hyo, it's "Ah" here.

1918
01:03:17,649 --> 01:03:20,720
(She's busy right now.)

1919
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,950
- Shall we get up? - Get up?

1920
01:03:21,950 --> 01:03:23,120
In 1, 2, 3.

1921
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
(She faked it.)

1922
01:03:24,819 --> 01:03:26,859
(They both collapse.)

1923
01:03:26,859 --> 01:03:29,859
What are you guys doing?

1924
01:03:30,629 --> 01:03:32,189
(I'm going to pay attention and look.)

1925
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:34,999
- What are you two... - Answer!

1926
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,830
- Answer? - Answer.

1927
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:40,039
- Goodness. - Answer.

1928
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:41,939
- What is it? - Say it.

1929
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:44,140
- Don't hold her. - "Ah Ram".

1930
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,080
(She's correct.)

1931
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,010
How did you see?

1932
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,209
- Could you see? - I saw it.

1933
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,450
- Gosh. - She got it right away.

1934
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,450
I peeked.

1935
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,649
Next, it's our turn.

1936
01:03:55,649 --> 01:03:57,850
- Yes. - This is going to be dirty.

1937
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:00,419
Here they come.

1938
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:03,060
- What do I do? - Oh, gosh.

1939
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,060
(They're very nervous.)

1940
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,430
The weather is perfect for a dirty match.

1941
01:04:07,229 --> 01:04:10,370
(The two who are known to play dirty meet once again.)

1942
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:13,069
(The original dirty player is Grasshopper.)

1943
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:15,169
Both teams are...

1944
01:04:15,669 --> 01:04:18,310
very dirty.

1945
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:19,410
What did you do now?

1946
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,310
(A well-matched contest)

1947
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,209
I'm looking forward to this.

1948
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,749
(Dragon versus Tiger. Who will win?)

1949
01:04:24,749 --> 01:04:26,749
- I'm looking forward to this. - Kwang Soo is going to be dirty.

1950
01:04:26,749 --> 01:04:29,050
I think Jae Seok will get dragged around.

1951
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:31,120
(Kwang Soo is going to be dirty.)

1952
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,589
(Pulling)

1953
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:35,959
- Okay. - Why does he pull his pants up?

1954
01:04:35,959 --> 01:04:37,560
(It's all the way up.)

1955
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,229
Let's go.

1956
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:42,769
We'll put the letters on. Don't look.

1957
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:45,430
(Dirty meets dirty.)

1958
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:47,539
(The way they are dressed suggests it will be a very dirty match.)

1959
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:50,010
- Why did you pull up your pants? - It feels better like this.

1960
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:51,310
This way, it won't come off.

1961
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,510
("Hwi Sae" and "Hal Gi")

1962
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,410
Hey, let's show each other.

1963
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:57,249
Let's just show each other.

1964
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,649
Let's go. Ready,

1965
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,249
set...

1966
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:04,019
(The game starts.)

1967
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:05,450
It's competitive.

1968
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,859
This is hard.

1969
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:08,289
(Pulling)

1970
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,930
(Her vision is blocked.)

1971
01:05:11,289 --> 01:05:14,859
(Eun Ji controls the hoodie as she pleases.)

1972
01:05:14,859 --> 01:05:17,870
(She sees Cho Rong's letter.)

1973
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:20,939
Kwang Soo!

1974
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:22,510
What's that?

1975
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,680
(She calls for Kwang Soo.)

1976
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,379
(There is a face competition going on.)

1977
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,550
(Whoever moves their head first loses.)

1978
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,089
(They defend with their faces.)

1979
01:05:39,789 --> 01:05:41,620
This is short-track speed skating.

1980
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:43,729
(That looks like...)

1981
01:05:43,729 --> 01:05:44,830
What's this?

1982
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:49,200
(Finals for face short-track)

1983
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,970
(The two players are getting ready to go forward.)

1984
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,200
What's that?

1985
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,669
(This is the fair dirty play.)

1986
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:02,010
(It's always a tight match. This is no different.)

1987
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,979
(None of them is backing down. This is a tight match.)

1988
01:06:04,979 --> 01:06:06,249
Are you skating?

1989
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:09,519
Answer!

1990
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,959
(Does Eun Ji know the answer?)

1991
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:14,959
(They don't care.)

1992
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:15,990
Answer?

1993
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,060
"Hal Gi".

1994
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,990
(Eun Ji's answer is "Hal Gi".)

1995
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,229
(She's correct.)

1996
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:26,539
(What?)

1997
01:06:26,539 --> 01:06:27,640
Jae Seok.

1998
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,470
We can see yours.

1999
01:06:29,539 --> 01:06:30,870
You're showing it...

2000
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,479
to everybody.

2001
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:38,149
(While they were face skating,)

2002
01:06:38,149 --> 01:06:43,390
(Eun Ji saw Jae Seok's letter.)

2003
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,789
Did you see his?

2004
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:46,519
You saw his?

2005
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,890
(Thanks to Eun Ji, they advance to the semifinal.)

2006
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:51,189
Didn't you see it, Cho Rong?

2007
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,359
I only saw half a lap of short-track.

2008
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,169
We were supposed to watch two laps. That's too bad.

2009
01:06:56,169 --> 01:06:57,330
(Let's compliment the dirty players who played a great match.)

2010
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,700
I'm so mad.

2011
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,269
(The semifinalists have been decided.)

2012
01:07:00,269 --> 01:07:01,399
Goodness.

2013
01:07:01,399 --> 01:07:03,209
We are ready.

2014
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,370
Winners, please come on out.

2015
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:06,680
Ji Hyo and Haha should go first.

2016
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:07,979
Okay.

2017
01:07:08,479 --> 01:07:09,749
(Okay, let's do this!)

2018
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:10,780
All right!

2019
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,780
(Ji Hyo against Haha, and Ha Young against Se Chan)

2020
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:12,979
Am I facing Ji Hyo?

2021
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:14,879
Please get close.

2022
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,720
Haha and Ji Hyo both look like men.

2023
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,019
I touched her shoulders,

2024
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:21,419
and she's muscular here.

2025
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:22,729
She is.

2026
01:07:22,729 --> 01:07:23,830
(Don't you underestimate her.)

2027
01:07:23,959 --> 01:07:25,459
("Deu Re" for Ji Hyo and Ha Young)

2028
01:07:25,459 --> 01:07:27,030
("Ki Seu" for Haha and Se Chan)

2029
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:28,129
Where is it for you?

2030
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,900
I...

2031
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,369
- Left side? - What about you?

2032
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,100
- Let's go. - Ready,

2033
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,100
(They're around the same build. Who'll be the winners?)

2034
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,199
set...

2035
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,169
(The game starts.)

2036
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,440
(She lies down.)

2037
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,279
What are you doing?

2038
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:44,810
It's on the floor.

2039
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,909
Where's Haha's?

2040
01:07:45,909 --> 01:07:47,079
(It's a competitive game.)

2041
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:49,850
(Haha sees "Re".)

2042
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,589
This is uncomfortable, Haha.

2043
01:07:53,419 --> 01:07:54,619
Ji Hyo.

2044
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,260
Ji Hyo, "Seu".

2045
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,760
(Se Chan sees hers too.)

2046
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,560
- "Seu". - It's "Deu".

2047
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,930
She's "Deu", Haha.

2048
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,629
(He has Se Chan's information.)

2049
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,629
Answer.

2050
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,070
"Deu Re".

2051
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,039
All right!

2052
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,110
(He's correct.)

2053
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,279
("Deu Re" indicates the weight of one's character.)

2054
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:14,709
- What's "Deu Re"? - How did you know?

2055
01:08:14,709 --> 01:08:15,909
I saw yours.

2056
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,279
This time...

2057
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,779
It's been a while.

2058
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:20,850
(Second round of semifinals)

2059
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:23,619
This will be good to watch.

2060
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:24,690
(Kwang Soo and Eun Ji versus Jong Kook and Na Eun)

2061
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:26,959
- This will be good to watch. - It's been a while.

2062
01:08:26,959 --> 01:08:29,390
If Eun Ji beats Na Eun,

2063
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:30,430
you never know what'll happen.

2064
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:32,390
This is my first time, so I'm really nervous.

2065
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,560
Don't look.

2066
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:36,930
(Kwang Soo is tall and agile.)

2067
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:38,029
Put on the letters.

2068
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:40,369
This reminds me of Andre Kim's fashion show.

2069
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:44,739
Left or right?

2070
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:45,839
This side, right?

2071
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:47,709
("Wi Re" for Kwang Soo and Eun Ji)

2072
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:49,550
("Gam Da" for Jong Kook and Na Eun)

2073
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,310
- Ready, - Come on.

2074
01:08:52,579 --> 01:08:53,749
set...

2075
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,020
(The game starts.)

2076
01:08:56,289 --> 01:08:59,419
(Eun Ji tightens the string as soon as the game starts.)

2077
01:08:59,419 --> 01:09:00,489
Hold on.

2078
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:01,560
(She spins it around.)

2079
01:09:02,289 --> 01:09:04,589
(Eun Ji sees "Gam".)

2080
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:05,589
- I can't see. - Kwang Soo.

2081
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:08,199
Kwang Soo, "Gam".

2082
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,499
She sees it so well.

2083
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:11,129
She's so good.

2084
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:13,199
(Eun Ji saw her letter,)

2085
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:14,499
(so it's Kwang Soo's turn.)

2086
01:09:14,499 --> 01:09:17,110
(Kwang Soo starts attacking as well.)

2087
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,940
(He attacks by going round and round.)

2088
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,709
(Keep trying.)

2089
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:22,180
I saw it.

2090
01:09:22,379 --> 01:09:23,779
I saw it.

2091
01:09:23,779 --> 01:09:24,949
(This won't work.)

2092
01:09:24,949 --> 01:09:26,010
"Re".

2093
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,020
(While Kwang Soo takes a second, he sees Eun Ji's letter.)

2094
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,520
(What is he doing?)

2095
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:35,119
What? "Re"?

2096
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:36,560
Answer. "Wi Re"?

2097
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,659
("Wi Re"?)

2098
01:09:37,659 --> 01:09:39,029
"Wi Re". Okay.

2099
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:40,199
(He's correct.)

2100
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:41,800
(Sighing)

2101
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,829
Goodness.

2102
01:09:43,169 --> 01:09:45,499
It was Jong Kook's game anyways.

2103
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,940
Hey, why did you take your phone out?

2104
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:49,100
(Why did you take your phone out?)

2105
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:50,739
I was going to take a picture.

2106
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:53,079
- I was going to look at it. - This was his game anyways.

2107
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:54,339
(Jong Kook and Na Eun advance to the finals.)

2108
01:09:54,339 --> 01:09:55,440
That was so funny.

2109
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,150
(Finals is Haha and Se Chan versus Jong Kook and Na Eun.)

2110
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,949
- Who do you want? - Whoever.

2111
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,550
(Finals is Haha and Se Chan versus Jong Kook and Na Eun.)

2112
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:01,749
You can take Na Eun.

2113
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,089
Okay. I won't say no.

2114
01:10:05,089 --> 01:10:06,289
I'm envious of you, Se Chan.

2115
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:07,589
Please put the letters on.

2116
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,119
- Haha. - Yes.

2117
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:10,690
We came this far, so we have to win.

2118
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:11,760
Of course.

2119
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,900
("Gi Yuk" for Haha and Se Chan)

2120
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,959
This is our chance.

2121
01:10:14,959 --> 01:10:16,669
("Tae Ggal" for Jong Kook and Na Eun)

2122
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,869
Se Chan, I think I'm already in pain.

2123
01:10:19,869 --> 01:10:20,900
Ready,

2124
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,209
(Which team will advance to the next level?)

2125
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:25,310
set...

2126
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,409
(The final match starts.)

2127
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:29,749
No.

2128
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:31,079
(Is Se Chan helpless against Na Eun?)

2129
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:32,209
Hold on.

2130
01:10:32,209 --> 01:10:33,449
Hey, hold on.

2131
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:37,789
(He goes round and round Na Eun.)

2132
01:10:37,789 --> 01:10:39,119
Hey, hold on.

2133
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:40,720
(Na Eun is busy avoiding him.)

2134
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:42,020
(What do I do?)

2135
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,089
I can't see.

2136
01:10:43,089 --> 01:10:45,260
(He can only see Na Eun.)

2137
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:47,300
- "Gi". Na Eun, yours is "Gi". - "Gi"?

2138
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,529
(Jong Kook sees the letter on Se Chan from the other side.)

2139
01:10:51,529 --> 01:10:53,440
(He has to look at Haha's to put the letters together.)

2140
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,800
- "Gi". - Hold on.

2141
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,940
- Go away. - Look at his!

2142
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:59,610
(Hurry up.)

2143
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:02,010
Look at his!

2144
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,810
(Lifting)

2145
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:07,379
(Poor Haha.)

2146
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:08,879
- This is over. - Look at his, Na Eun.

2147
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:10,820
Na Eun, it's "Gi". Look at his.

2148
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:11,850
Okay.

2149
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:13,089
I can't see.

2150
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,789
(If Na Eun can't see,)

2151
01:11:15,789 --> 01:11:17,959
(he can look for himself.)

2152
01:11:17,959 --> 01:11:19,730
(What's going on?)

2153
01:11:20,629 --> 01:11:21,699
"Gi Yuk".

2154
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:22,730
(He finds the letter "Yuk".)

2155
01:11:22,730 --> 01:11:26,169
(He's correct.)

2156
01:11:26,339 --> 01:11:29,270
(Jong Kook and Na Eun are the winners.)

2157
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,010
What happened, Haha?

2158
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,239
Hey, are you all right?

2159
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:36,379
This sweater has no hole!

2160
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,520
(Haha and Se Chan lose unfortunately.)

2161
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,150
Do you guys always lose?

2162
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:42,220
Yes!

2163
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,789
(You know well.)

2164
01:11:44,789 --> 01:11:46,260
- It's been like this for 8 years. - Cho Rong said,

2165
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,690
"Do you guys always lose?"

2166
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,890
(Jong Kook always wins. They advance to the next level.)

2167
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:51,289
(I tried so hard.)

2168
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:53,930
Sadly, it's time to say goodbye to Apink.

2169
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,629
(It's time to say goodbye to the quest fairies.)

2170
01:11:55,629 --> 01:11:57,369
- Please! - Why?

2171
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,669
- A little bit more! - Please!

2172
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:02,100
30 more minutes. Please!

2173
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:04,909
We're just getting started.

2174
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:06,610
Let's do another round.

2175
01:12:06,839 --> 01:12:08,079
That was so short.

2176
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:10,379
It was great having them.

2177
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,480
Let's give a round of applause for Apink.

2178
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,520
Thank you.

2179
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:24,560
Where is it?

2180
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:26,300
Is it around the cameraman's neck?

2181
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,360
(Find the next quest.)

2182
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:28,730
- There it is. - Where?

2183
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:29,999
- It's outside. - It's outside.

2184
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,699
Ji Hyo, good catch.

2185
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,900
Last Party Time.

2186
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:35,369
Out of all the rice cake soup ingredients,

2187
01:12:35,499 --> 01:12:37,440
you have earned a pot, beef,

2188
01:12:37,510 --> 01:12:40,709
You have not obtained rice cake, seasoning, eggs, and seaweed,

2189
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:42,440
so they're hidden around the resort.

2190
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:45,680
The person who finds the ingredients and makes rice cake soup advances.

2191
01:12:46,879 --> 01:12:48,879
However, each person can only find one ingredient.

2192
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:50,650
The sled goes down once you find a partner...

2193
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:52,089
who has a different ingredient.

2194
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:53,419
(You can only find one ingredient each.)

2195
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:54,789
(You must get on the sled with someone who found a different one.)

2196
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:57,129
The clan member you partner up with is very important.

2197
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,659
It's about who you come down the hill with.

2198
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:01,260
I have to find it.

2199
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:02,300
Find what?

2200
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,570
- Ingredients, Seok Jin. - Ingredients.

2201
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:05,129
- Ingredients for rice cake soup. - I see.

2202
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:07,070
I have to find it fast and leave.

2203
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,800
We have to find the ingredients.

2204
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,839
What do they look like?

2205
01:13:11,709 --> 01:13:12,739
Is it an envelope?

2206
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:14,239
There must be one.

2207
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,279
I think there'll be one here.

2208
01:13:15,839 --> 01:13:16,909
Is it hanging from here?

2209
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:18,550
Can you tell me once you see one?

2210
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,579
I'm not the only one who can't see it, right?

2211
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,279
Why can't I find any?

2212
01:13:22,879 --> 01:13:25,289
(She becomes suspicious.)

2213
01:13:25,789 --> 01:13:28,119
(Is it in the back of your head?)

2214
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:29,320
It can't be in here.

2215
01:13:30,629 --> 01:13:31,730
Why is it nowhere to be found?

2216
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:32,959
(I'm suspicious of you.)

2217
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,199
Are there mission envelopes?

2218
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:36,970
Give it to me.

2219
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,230
(Yelling)

2220
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:40,199
Hurry.

2221
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,499
(She's helpless, so she just yells at nobody.)

2222
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:42,940
This is pretty.

2223
01:13:43,539 --> 01:13:44,570
Is it here?

2224
01:13:45,970 --> 01:13:48,379
Is this the famous candle street?

2225
01:13:48,379 --> 01:13:51,379
(Candle street brightens the surrounding.)

2226
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,850
There has to be an envelope here.

2227
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:56,949
There has to be one. Oh, dear.

2228
01:13:57,289 --> 01:13:58,390
What's this?

2229
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,919
(She was looking at the candles and found an ingredient card.)

2230
01:14:00,919 --> 01:14:02,190
(Seasoning)

2231
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,329
(Jeon So Min earned seasoning.)

2232
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:07,659
Wasn't I so swift?

2233
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:08,900
I was so quick.

2234
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:10,529
Did the others find anything?

2235
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:12,930
I hope there's somebody.

2236
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,699
Look at the sun. It's so pretty.

2237
01:14:15,699 --> 01:14:16,810
(Who will get the remaining ingredients?)

2238
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:18,940
Look. It's so pretty.

2239
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:21,279
This is a beautiful world.

2240
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:23,650
I guess you found one early.

2241
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:25,379
(He clenches his teeth.)

2242
01:14:25,379 --> 01:14:26,850
You don't have a partner, so you can't go.

2243
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,150
You're right.

2244
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:29,350
(Finding a clan member is just as important.)

2245
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,489
Ji Hyo. Did you find one?

2246
01:14:31,489 --> 01:14:33,190
(The other members haven't found any. They're still looking.)

2247
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,860
There must be one here.

2248
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,029
(The other members haven't found any. They're still looking.)

2249
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,300
(Seok Jin spots something!)

2250
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:42,329
This is it!

2251
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:44,070
(Seok Jin spots something!)

2252
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:45,369
(He found one in the door crack.)

2253
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:46,499
Seok Jin found it.

2254
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,699
Goodness.

2255
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,539
It was there?

2256
01:14:49,539 --> 01:14:50,709
(Seok Jin finds an ingredient after So Min.)

2257
01:14:50,709 --> 01:14:51,709
I found one.

2258
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,610
(Eggs)

2259
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:56,209
(Seok Jin obtained eggs.)

2260
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,720
What happens now that I found an ingredient?

2261
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,850
Who found an ingredient?

2262
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:03,050
It's Seok Jin.

2263
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,890
(Why does it have to be Seok Jin?)

2264
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:06,459
Who wants to team up with me?

2265
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,520
- I won't team up with Seok Jin. - This is...

2266
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:10,959
He is untrustworthy.

2267
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:13,230
Who wants to team up with me?

2268
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:14,629
(Has anyone found an ingredient?)

2269
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:16,669
You get on the sled with someone who found an ingredient, right?

2270
01:15:16,869 --> 01:15:18,300
Someone who found an ingredient?

2271
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:19,869
Someone who found an ingredient?

2272
01:15:19,869 --> 01:15:22,499
(She passes by Seok Jin.)

2273
01:15:24,409 --> 01:15:26,169
- Haven't you found an ingredient? - No, I haven't.

2274
01:15:26,169 --> 01:15:28,579
(Why hasn't anyone found an ingredient?)

2275
01:15:28,579 --> 01:15:30,409
I need to go and cook rice cake soup.

2276
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:32,949
I want to team up with Jong Kook...

2277
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:35,449
because he is fair.

2278
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,390
(Jong Kook is searching diligently.)

2279
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:38,690
My goodness.

2280
01:15:38,850 --> 01:15:40,020
My goodness,

2281
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:41,720
why didn't I see this before?

2282
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,029
My goodness.

2283
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:47,659
(Seaweed)

2284
01:15:47,659 --> 01:15:50,369
(Jong Kook obtained seaweed.)

2285
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:54,369
With whom should I go? Hold on.

2286
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:58,539
Jong Kook, did you find an ingredient?

2287
01:15:58,610 --> 01:15:59,739
So Min.

2288
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,480
- You found an ingredient, right? - Yes.

2289
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:02,539
Let's go down the hill.

2290
01:16:02,539 --> 01:16:08,820
(Will you join So Min's clan?)

2291
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:09,890
- Let's go. - Okay.

2292
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:12,850
(Yes)

2293
01:16:13,619 --> 01:16:14,959
- What are you doing? - Gosh.

2294
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:16,320
- Hey. - Don't be like that.

2295
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:19,360
(So Min brushes him off.)

2296
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,930
(Did they form a clan?)

2297
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:24,029
Seok Jin found an ingredient, but I didn't want to team up...

2298
01:16:24,029 --> 01:16:25,329
- with him. - Let's hurry up.

2299
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:26,900
It's important...

2300
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,940
that we hurry up and go down.

2301
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:30,869
I found my savior!

2302
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:32,140
Okay.

2303
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:35,510
We don't know what's waiting for us.

2304
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,879
- You are right. - We have to keep advancing.

2305
01:16:36,879 --> 01:16:38,079
There it is.

2306
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:42,279
This is the final quest of Rice Cake Soup in the Sky Race.

2307
01:16:42,279 --> 01:16:44,249
(The final quest, Snow tube)

2308
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:45,989
The two players who found an ingredient...

2309
01:16:45,989 --> 01:16:48,760
must take a snow tube to the final destination.

2310
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,930
(The two players who found an ingredient...)

2311
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:51,060
(must take a snow tube to the final destination.)

2312
01:16:51,329 --> 01:16:53,230
I am a bit scared.

2313
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,300
Let's go.

2314
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,730
(You can reach the final destination by riding this snow tube.)

2315
01:16:55,730 --> 01:16:56,829
So Min, let's go.

2316
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,699
- It's okay. - Okay.

2317
01:16:58,770 --> 01:17:00,369
Should I lie back?

2318
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:01,470
Should I raise my legs?

2319
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:02,600
(She babbles out of fear.)

2320
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,270
(She goes down with a scream.)

2321
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,470
Mom!

2322
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,709
(Here I come to eat rice cake soup!)

2323
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:14,220
(She moves through the wind to level up.)

2324
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:20,289
(This is so much fun.)

2325
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,529
(My goodness.)

2326
01:17:24,959 --> 01:17:26,529
(It's actually fun.)

2327
01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:29,360
This is fun. This is fun.

2328
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:30,869
Okay.

2329
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:32,470
Okay. Okay.

2330
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,699
(So Min, here I come!)

2331
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:42,180
(Let's level up!)

2332
01:17:42,339 --> 01:17:44,610
(He is carefree.)

2333
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:49,480
(He succeeds to land in a cute way.)

2334
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,550
(Sexy)

2335
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:51,749
This is great.

2336
01:17:54,489 --> 01:17:56,829
This is really fun.

2337
01:17:56,829 --> 01:17:59,060
- It's fun, right? - It's great.

2338
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:00,629
How pretty!

2339
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,959
- How pretty! - This place is nice.

2340
01:18:02,959 --> 01:18:04,499
Will we cook rice cake soup here?

2341
01:18:04,499 --> 01:18:06,839
My goodness, this is my first time.

2342
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:08,800
This is my first time. This place is pretty.

2343
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:11,339
- I agree. Do you want a photo? - Yes, please.

2344
01:18:11,339 --> 01:18:12,709
Thank you, Jong Kook.

2345
01:18:12,709 --> 01:18:13,709
Don't mention it.

2346
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:15,079
(They take a photo.)

2347
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:16,310
In 1, 2, 3.

2348
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,379
(Cute)

2349
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:20,249
(A photo by Jong Kook)

2350
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,579
Thank you.

2351
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:23,020
You must have taken a lot of photos.

2352
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:24,449
- That's not true. - The angle is really nice.

2353
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:25,520
Really?

2354
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:27,119
It's not here.

2355
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,390
(While the Tiger Moth Clan is taking photos...)

2356
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:29,390
It's not here.

2357
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:30,430
Haha, did you find an ingredient?

2358
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:32,159
- No, I didn't. - It's nowhere to be found.

2359
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,230
Did you find an ingredient?

2360
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:38,430
(At that moment)

2361
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:40,739
My goodness.

2362
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,539
(Kwang Soo finds an ingredient that was hidden.)

2363
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:48,440
(Rice cake)

2364
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:50,980
(Lee Kwang Soo obtained rice cake.)

2365
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,279
Rice cake! It's the most important ingredient.

2366
01:18:52,610 --> 01:18:53,980
Rice cake.

2367
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,520
Kwang Soo, did you find an ingredient?

2368
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,720
(Will you join Jee Seok Jin's clan?)

2369
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,820
Let's go together.

2370
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:58,820
- Did you find an ingredient? - Yes.

2371
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:00,020
If you found an ingredient, sure.

2372
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:01,220
It's important that we go down the hill.

2373
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:03,159
- Let's go. - I don't know what is going on.

2374
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:05,089
- What? - I don't know what is going on.

2375
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:07,659
Oh, we are taking a sled down.

2376
01:19:07,659 --> 01:19:09,659
(They arrive at the snow tube quest as well.)

2377
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,570
- Hold on. - I don't think I can do this.

2378
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:13,800
(They just need to take a snow tube down the slide.)

2379
01:19:14,739 --> 01:19:15,900
I can't do this.

2380
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,169
How are we supposed to ride this?

2381
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:19,980
I will run to the final destination.

2382
01:19:20,539 --> 01:19:23,140
It doesn't matter how we go down the hill, right?

2383
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,550
You must ride a snow tube in order to cook rice cake soup.

2384
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:27,379
What kind of nonsense is that?

2385
01:19:27,579 --> 01:19:28,919
Knock me out.

2386
01:19:28,919 --> 01:19:30,119
How old do you have to be to ride this?

2387
01:19:30,119 --> 01:19:32,820
Push me down the slope while I am sleeping.

2388
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,320
(He says anything that comes to mind.)

2389
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,829
Let's go. We need to hurry up because people are waiting.

2390
01:19:36,829 --> 01:19:38,029
The water is boiling.

2391
01:19:38,459 --> 01:19:40,230
- Let's go. - Okay.

2392
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,300
(Seok Jin's snow tube goes first.)

2393
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,499
(Screaming)

2394
01:19:52,409 --> 01:19:57,279
(He is having so much fun that he can't close his mouth.)

2395
01:19:58,680 --> 01:19:59,749
That was incredible.

2396
01:19:59,749 --> 01:20:02,180
(Seok Jin succeeds to land.)

2397
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:05,820
(Kwang Soo's snow tube goes next.)

2398
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,789
(This is so much fun.)

2399
01:20:07,789 --> 01:20:09,220
(Screaming)

2400
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:15,400
That was incredible.

2401
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,930
(The scaredy-cat succeeds to land as well.)

2402
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:18,869
(His face shows how intense the ride was.)

2403
01:20:18,869 --> 01:20:19,900
It was okay, right?

2404
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,440
- It was fun. - It was fun, right?

2405
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,140
It was really fun once I got on.

2406
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,610
It was really fast.

2407
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:25,970
The speed was incredible.

2408
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:28,010
Let's cook rice cake soup.

2409
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:29,510
- Okay. - Shall we cook rice cake soup?

2410
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:31,379
- Let's level up. - Let's level up together.

2411
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:32,949
Is there a bowl?

2412
01:20:32,949 --> 01:20:34,949
- Everyone important is here. - You are right.

2413
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:37,050
Seasoning.

2414
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:38,550
Let's add everything.

2415
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:39,890
- Let's add rice cake first. - Rice cake.

2416
01:20:40,119 --> 01:20:41,390
- Add rice cake. - Should I add everything?

2417
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,459
Isn't that too much?

2418
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:44,230
- Garlic. - That's too much garlic.

2419
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:45,459
That's...

2420
01:20:45,459 --> 01:20:46,959
(Add a lot of rice cake and garlic.)

2421
01:20:46,959 --> 01:20:48,529
Hey!

2422
01:20:48,529 --> 01:20:50,029
- The producer instructed me. - You added...

2423
01:20:50,029 --> 01:20:51,129
You added...

2424
01:20:51,129 --> 01:20:52,699
- You added too much garlic. - Should we add eggs later?

2425
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:54,400
It will be tasty. It's the taste of Korea.

2426
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:55,499
(The taste of Korea)

2427
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,869
(Let's give it a taste.)

2428
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:00,010
(What?)

2429
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:01,980
(She grimaces.)

2430
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:03,449
- What is it? - Hey!

2431
01:21:03,449 --> 01:21:04,749
(Her face tells everything.)

2432
01:21:04,879 --> 01:21:06,209
This is far from aromatic.

2433
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:08,079
It's really spicy.

2434
01:21:08,749 --> 01:21:10,119
You told me to add all of it.

2435
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,850
- You told me to add all of it. - You told her to add all of it.

2436
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:15,360
(In any case, they manage to make rice cake soup and level up.)

2437
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,459
It's tasty.

2438
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:17,629
There could be...

2439
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:20,100
some people who like this taste. It's not bad.

2440
01:21:21,329 --> 01:21:22,900
They already made...

2441
01:21:22,959 --> 01:21:24,829
- They look happy. - I know.

2442
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:27,900
(The 4 people who haven't found any ingredients...)

2443
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:29,270
(will form a clan of 2 people and ride a snow tube.)

2444
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:30,310
This is sad.

2445
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,209
A clan of two people.

2446
01:21:32,339 --> 01:21:33,810
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2447
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:35,180
Let's go.

2448
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:36,810
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2449
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:38,180
(Ji Hyo and Se Chan formed a clan.)

2450
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,520
(Giggling)

2451
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,150
Here I come!

2452
01:21:43,150 --> 01:21:45,350
(We didn't find an ingredient, but we will have fun.)

2453
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:47,320
All right.

2454
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,730
(Jae Seok and Haha formed a clan.)

2455
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:53,129
(The timid duo rides a snow tube.)

2456
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:54,499
My goodness.

2457
01:21:54,499 --> 01:21:55,999
(The timid duo rides a snow tube.)

2458
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:02,770
(Rice Cake Soup in the Sky Race ends.)

2459
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:06,839
The four of you will level up.

2460
01:22:07,709 --> 01:22:09,110
- Okay! - Yes!

2461
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:10,409
Okay.

2462
01:22:10,409 --> 01:22:11,409
Let's go.

2463
01:22:11,409 --> 01:22:14,720
Jae Seok, Haha, and Se Chan are Level One and last in place.

2464
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,220
For goodness' sake.

2465
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:19,020
- For goodness' sake. - I can't believe it.

2466
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:21,760
Remember your clan member.

2467
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,089
The secret of these clans will be revealed...

2468
01:22:24,089 --> 01:22:25,329
- next week. - What?

2469
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:29,300
(The secrets of the clans will be revealed next week?)

2470
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,470
