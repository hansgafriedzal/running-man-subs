1
00:00:07,113 --> 00:00:08,791
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:08,913 --> 00:00:10,742
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,743 --> 00:00:13,915
It's Seok Jin's birthday.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,052
- His fans sent us a coffee truck. - Coffee truck.

5
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:18,753
That's why we're having this.

6
00:00:18,754 --> 00:00:21,419
Goodness, how long has it been?

7
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:25,023
I think this is the first time his fans sent something to him...

8
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,462
- for the first time. - Really?

9
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:30,462
I would be grateful if his fans sent this for this,

10
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,733
- but if he personally paid this... - Out of his own pocket.

11
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,403
(This is reasonable doubt.)

12
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:35,803
People did talk about that a lot.

13
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:38,903
A lot of our staff members talked about the possibility.

14
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:41,943
- The lady who's serving coffee... - Did you all have a cup of coffee?

15
00:00:41,944 --> 00:00:44,266
looked very similar to Seok Jin.

16
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,913
Did you all have a cup of coffee?

17
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:47,913
(The man in question shows up at that time.)

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,053
- Right now... - What are you talking about now?

19
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:52,653
- We were saying that the lady... - Okay.

20
00:00:52,654 --> 00:00:55,149
- served us coffee resembled you. - No.

21
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,263
- She could be your relative. - This is my first time seeing her.

22
00:00:57,264 --> 00:00:59,143
- Listen. - Hello.

23
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,192
- You startled me! - My gosh.

24
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:07,484
(All of a sudden, a dark shadow enters.)

25
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:10,203
(Who are you?)

26
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,642
- You startled me. - What is this?

27
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:12,873
What was that, Haha?

28
00:01:12,874 --> 00:01:15,412
- We're filming a show. Go away. - Haha.

29
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:17,013
- You really scared me. - That was scary.

30
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:20,114
I can't look Haha in the eyes today. He looks too scary.

31
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,112
- He's a suspect. - He's a suspect.

32
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,164
Is it a criminal?

33
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,403
- This is too much. - Look at his pants.

34
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,222
Take off this hat!

35
00:01:27,223 --> 00:01:30,425
(The national host educates him about fashion.)

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,123
(He indeed sets an example for others.)

37
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,593
- Take it off. What is this? - Wait.

38
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,763
(Throwing away)

39
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:37,032
What is this?

40
00:01:37,033 --> 00:01:38,032
(His outfits are getting more abstruse.)

41
00:01:38,033 --> 00:01:40,373
What's going on with you lately? Have you gone mad?

42
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,817
Hey, Young Jin, come here.

43
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,362
- You said I looked cool! - What is this?

44
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:46,373
What is this nonsense?

45
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,686
- I've been too lenient on you. - Seriously.

46
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:50,136
Why are you wearing these kinds of outfits?

47
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,038
Before I tell you the rules of today's race,

48
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:58,222
I will announce the teams you have chosen yourselves first.

49
00:01:58,223 --> 00:02:00,476
- We chose our own teams? When? - We didn't choose any teams.

50
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:03,048
Do you remember the order of which you walked in here today?

51
00:02:03,193 --> 00:02:04,477
When we just walked in?

52
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:07,120
- Jae Seok was 1st. So Min, 2nd. - Yes, I was 1st.

53
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:10,293
Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, Haha,

54
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:12,552
- Se Chan, Jong Kook, and Ji Hyo. - Okay.

55
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:14,694
1, 2, 3, and 4 make a team.

56
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,542
5, 6, 7, and 8 make a team.

57
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,803
- No way. - We won.

58
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,012
- This will be an easy win. - It will be easy.

59
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,792
My team is too weak.

60
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:23,530
- We'll go against them? - My goodness.

61
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:25,613
- Don't you think it's not fair? - Let us battle each other.

62
00:02:25,614 --> 00:02:26,852
This isn't fair.

63
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:29,137
- We'll go against each other here. - That would be a fair game.

64
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:31,404
Today, you must cut your opponent's wire...

65
00:02:31,453 --> 00:02:33,311
for the bomb one by one.

66
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:35,141
You will win when your opponent's bomb goes off.

67
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:37,891
The race is called the Bomb Is About to Explode.

68
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:39,438
"The Bomb Is About to Explode"?

69
00:02:39,524 --> 00:02:44,250
Five wires of different colors are connected to the bomb.

70
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:46,702
If you cut one of these wires...

71
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:48,391
(There are 5 wires, and 1 of the wires sets off a bomb.)

72
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,932
- The bomb will go off. - What?

73
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:55,175
However, in order to cut the wires,

74
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,012
you must carry out a special mission.

75
00:02:57,013 --> 00:02:58,226
What's the mission?

76
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:00,553
The Korea Tourism Organization ranked...

77
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:05,023
30 unique Korean dishes that foreigners want to try. uni

78
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:07,477
We selected 10 dishes out of those and ranked them in order.

79
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:09,863
You must choose one dish...

80
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:11,662
and eat one person's serving.

81
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:14,433
(They will choose 1 dish and eat 1 person's serving.)

82
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:19,873
However, you must find the dish cheaper than your opponent's.

83
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:20,945
(They must find a lower price.)

84
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:23,472
- We have to find a good restaurant. - That's the point.

85
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,928
- We must find inexpensive places. - Cheap food.

86
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,313
When you accomplish your mission,

87
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:30,112
you can cut your opponent's wires.

88
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:32,435
When your opponent's bomb goes off,

89
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:35,007
the race will be over right away.

90
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:36,923
- Are you serious? - Really?

91
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:38,982
Gosh, this will be hard.

92
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:40,640
However, you have hope.

93
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,523
Each team will have one chance card...

94
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,846
to use when you complete your missions.

95
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:47,232
There are chance cards.

96
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,012
(Discount Card, Lowest Price Card, Changing Dish Card, Rip-off Card)

97
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,702
On top of those cards, each team will have...

98
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:53,732
- 1 Penalty Exemption Card. - Is that for only 1 person?

99
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,732
(Each team gets 1 Penalty Exemption Card.)

100
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,046
- Someone will be exempted. - Is that for only one person?

101
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:59,534
Gosh, it's going to get messy here. People in my team will go crazy.

102
00:03:59,644 --> 00:04:00,743
We must end it for good.

103
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:02,843
As for this, the order is very important.

104
00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,137
It's very important which team eats first.

105
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,782
We'll have a simple match...

106
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:09,510
to decide which team will go first.

107
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:12,222
Among these 30 eggs,

108
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:14,416
there is only one raw egg.

109
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:17,923
- Let's see what will happen. - My gosh.

110
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,733
Each team will take turns. And one member can crack...

111
00:04:20,734 --> 00:04:22,293
up to three eggs.

112
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:24,656
The team that picks the raw egg will lose.

113
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,250
- Which team should go first? - What should we do?

114
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:28,933
(Approaching)

115
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,502
- Okay. - He's so scary.

116
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,973
- He must go first. - The suspect is here.

117
00:04:31,974 --> 00:04:33,373
- Do I have to crack it on myself? - That's right.

118
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,838
- Of course. Take off your hat. - We'll blur you out.

119
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,556
We'll blur you out.

120
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:40,510
(Choosing carefully)

121
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,613
- There's only 1. - There's only 1.

122
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,200
(There is only 1 raw egg among 30 eggs.)

123
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:48,252
(Haha carefully chose an egg in the center.)

124
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,465
Go, go, go.

125
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,885
There's only one, but he's going to get the raw egg?

126
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,533
This is like 31 Game. Do you know about that game?

127
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,644
I picked one from the center.

128
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,549
Go ahead. 1, 2.

129
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:00,303
(What's the egg Haha chose?)

130
00:05:00,304 --> 00:05:01,402
(It's a boiled egg.)

131
00:05:01,403 --> 00:05:02,787
- There you go! - Yes.

132
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,942
(Where are you running off to?)

133
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,791
- Crack 1 more. - I'll crack 2.

134
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,942
- That one is not it. - I'm nervous.

135
00:05:08,943 --> 00:05:09,953
Okay.

136
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:11,743
- Darn it. - He's going to crack one more?

137
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,283
(With the momentum going, he cracks 3 eggs in a row.)

138
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:15,768
- Excellent! - Okay.

139
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17,923
(Haha successfully cracks 3 eggs.)

140
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:19,423
- It won't make it back to me. - This can't be.

141
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,392
- I'm in trouble. - This can't be.

142
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:22,392
- We're in trouble. - Kwang Soo.

143
00:05:22,393 --> 00:05:23,822
You should only crack one.

144
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,522
Don't get the raw egg. Please. It's the New Year.

145
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,433
You should crack only one since we're worried about you.

146
00:05:28,434 --> 00:05:29,962
- Crack only 1 egg. - Crack just 1.

147
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,115
Just crack one egg.

148
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,132
Usually, Kwang Soo gets it.

149
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:36,233
(He has the worst luck when it comes to random draws.)

150
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,970
(The moment his hands touch it, a miracle occurs.)

151
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:43,552
(This unlucky guy has a knack for picking out raw eggs.)

152
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,613
(Will his back luck continue today?)

153
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:49,012
(Is that the raw egg?)

154
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:53,553
(Or is it a boiled egg?)

155
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:54,822
- Okay. - Okay.

156
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:55,833
(It's a boiled egg.)

157
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,063
(He successfully dodges the raw egg.)

158
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:59,306
- Just end it there. - Come on, Kwang Soo.

159
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:00,533
You should go for three in the beginning.

160
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,993
Come on. Go for three eggs.

161
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,762
- Come on, Kwang Soo. - Hey, Se Chan.

162
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,127
- You should go for it. - Kwang Soo, don't do it.

163
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,402
You ought to go for it.

164
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,485
(You'll do one more?)

165
00:06:08,604 --> 00:06:09,614
You ought to go for it.

166
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,153
Please, no!

167
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,969
(No way!)

168
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:15,673
(Kwang Soo gets the raw egg out of 30 boiled ones.)

169
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:16,855
What is this?

170
00:06:18,284 --> 00:06:19,557
- What is this? - Did this really happen?

171
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:21,152
No!

172
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:22,353
I can't believe this.

173
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:24,676
This is why people think our show is scripted.

174
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,828
(This is the miraculous moment Kwang Soo has created.)

175
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:34,262
(When others urged him to do more, he picked up the second one.)

176
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:36,859
(He gets the raw egg without fail.)

177
00:06:37,034 --> 00:06:39,002
I told you to crack only one egg.

178
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:41,296
This is crazy. Why do you do this?

179
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:43,726
This is unbelievable.

180
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,217
You're something else.

181
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:48,272
All right. Team Jong Kook will set out first.

182
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,572
- Okay! - Okay!

183
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,361
- Let's go! Nevis! - They're going first again.

184
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,856
Do we get to choose the dish?

185
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,613
Jong Kook, it might be hard...

186
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,353
- to find the food in first place. - You're right.

187
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,423
- We should pick one in the middle. - Something unique.

188
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:01,092
Otherwise, it might be hard to find.

189
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,322
- 10th place? - We'll win...

190
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,522
- no matter what. - Let's go with the 10th place.

191
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,793
1, 2, 3.

192
00:07:05,794 --> 00:07:07,392
(What's the dish Team Jong Kook has chosen?)

193
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,202
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon)

194
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,233
(They chose Pyeongyang naengmyeon!)

195
00:07:12,234 --> 00:07:14,596
- It's Pyeongyang naengmyeon! - Yes!

196
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:17,803
(At your first bite, it tastes bland and plain.)

197
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,913
(The more you eat it, the more it captivates you.)

198
00:07:20,914 --> 00:07:23,712
Team Jong Kook, you can set out to find the dish...

199
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:25,834
- in the price range you want. - Yes!

200
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:27,613
Team Jae Seok will wait first.

201
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,752
After the first price has been decided,

202
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,553
- you'll set out then. - Let's eat the tastiest one.

203
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:34,351
- What is this mess? - Kwang Soo.

204
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,993
Why did you risk the game like that?

205
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:39,761
(An unlucky guy is scolding another unlucky guy.)

206
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,015
- He's getting scolded. - It would've been you if not me.

207
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:46,202
- Let's go. - We're going to go.

208
00:07:46,203 --> 00:07:47,849
- Let's go. - Let's get going.

209
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,767
- How did that happen, seriously? - Exactly.

210
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,673
Jong Kook, how much do you want to pay for naengmyeon?

211
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,442
- The basic price for that is... - Pyeongyang naengmyeon...

212
00:07:55,443 --> 00:07:57,838
- It costs more than 10 dollars. - Yes, there's a fixed basic price.

213
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,313
Hold on, but still.

214
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:00,553
I'm sure there's a place with reasonable prices.

215
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:02,230
Is there? Try to find one.

216
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:04,141
I found Pyeongyang naengmyeon with a reasonable price.

217
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,983
- The price is... - Is that what the review says?

218
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,812
Yes. It's only 9 dollars and 50 cents.

219
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:10,387
- See? It's Pyeongyang naengmyeon. - How much?

220
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,807
9 dollars and 50 cents?

221
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,293
- That's not bad. - Hey, hey.

222
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,793
This place is cheaper than other places...

223
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,611
- by 1 dollar and 50 cents. - It's 1.5 dollars cheaper.

224
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,863
- Are you okay with this place? - I like it.

225
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,358
- Okay, good find. - That's a very reasonable price.

226
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,120
Things are smooth with our team.

227
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,891
Okay. Let's go even if we lose.

228
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,442
By the way, the other team might be thrown off.

229
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:29,673
Usually, that dish costs about 12 to 13 dollars.

230
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:31,113
That's right. It usually costs that much.

231
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,143
Only a few cents will determine...

232
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,253
- the winning team of today's match. - Exactly.

233
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,423
On a TV show, I ate...

234
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:40,653
- a lot of Pyeongyang naengmyeon. - Right.

235
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,573
My goodness, the flavors were so varied.

236
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:44,192
There wasn't a restaurant that had the same flavors.

237
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:45,436
(He's Pyeongyang naengmyeon expert.)

238
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:50,373
Which restaurant was the tastiest one out of the dishes you tried?

239
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,418
Look over there now.

240
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:55,547
- It's their time now. - Okay.

241
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,643
(It's time for them to hold hands.)

242
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:00,413
(They clump Jong Kook and Ji Hyo together.)

243
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,543
It's their conversation.

244
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,813
She was just asking a good Pyeongyang naengmyeon restaurant.

245
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:04,995
Why is that important?

246
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,632
- This could've happened. Ask me. - Hey.

247
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,066
Where did you have the best Pyeongyang naengmyeon?

248
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:10,423
The place I had it with you.

249
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:14,793
(The place I had it with you)

250
00:09:14,794 --> 00:09:15,923
Nice line!

251
00:09:15,924 --> 00:09:17,580
- Yes, what a nice line. - Nice!

252
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,136
Stop it, guys.

253
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:22,092
- Let's take it slow for now. - Yes, let's take our time.

254
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,154
- "Stop it, guys." - Let's take it slow.

255
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:25,415
We won't overdo it.

256
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,472
- It's because our team is the best. - Right, right.

257
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,303
- Everything is so smooth. - Yes.

258
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,688
It's just that we're boring.

259
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:34,813
Here it is. Okay.

260
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,173
- We can go in there? - Yes.

261
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,901
- Yes, yes. Come in. - Let's go.

262
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:39,413
(Since they didn't reserve the restaurant, )

263
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:41,413
(they're not sure if they can film the show or not.)

264
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,372
Shouldn't we inform them first? Wait here.

265
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,564
Should we inform them first?

266
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:48,023
Could we film the show at the corner?

267
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,393
(Will the owner give them permission?)

268
00:09:49,394 --> 00:09:51,362
Could we film the show at the corner?

269
00:09:51,363 --> 00:09:52,677
(Will the owner give them permission?)

270
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,563
- Yes, yes. - We won't film other customers.

271
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:55,776
- Thank you. - Let's go to the end.

272
00:09:56,064 --> 00:09:57,063
All the way to the end.

273
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,962
(Thank you for your cooperation.)

274
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:00,589
There's a table at the corner.

275
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,883
There's one at the corner.

276
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:03,972
(They just need to eat Pyeongyang naengmyeon now.)

277
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,822
It's the lunch rush.

278
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,336
You have arrived at the restaurant now.

279
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:10,742
As we informed you earlier,

280
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,582
you can only eat one serving at each restaurant.

281
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,575
You can only eat one serving at each restaurant.

282
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:18,595
- We can order only one serving? - Yes.

283
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,082
- We get to eat one serving, right? - For the whole group?

284
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:22,517
- No, it's for all of you. - It's for all of us.

285
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,393
- That won't be enough. - That won't be enough.

286
00:10:25,394 --> 00:10:26,677
We'll finish the dish with one bite.

287
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,008
Then let's order a large one.

288
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:31,285
Then we have to pay more for that.

289
00:10:31,904 --> 00:10:34,433
(Besides, it's 50 cents more expensive than their research.)

290
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,832
- We can order extra noodles. - That costs one more dollar.

291
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,702
- Yes, we can order extra noodles. - Yes, let's get extra noodles.

292
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:41,372
(And they'll order extra noodles on top of that?)

293
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:42,525
We should...

294
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,994
- order that. - Yes.

295
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,643
Other restaurants charge 12 to 13 dollars for this dish.

296
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,183
- Yes. - That's still 11 dollars.

297
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:49,982
- This is our first dish. - Yes.

298
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,852
Paying 10 dollars for this dish is already cheap.

299
00:10:51,853 --> 00:10:53,383
- An extra dollar won't matter. - Right.

300
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:55,746
- The one with extra noodles. - Extra noodles, please.

301
00:10:55,853 --> 00:10:56,893
- Give us a lot of noodles, please. - Yes.

302
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,362
- We'll get the 11-dollar dish. - We'll get the 11-dollar dish.

303
00:10:58,363 --> 00:10:59,663
- Just one dish, please. - With broth?

304
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,845
- Yes. - Yes.

305
00:11:01,564 --> 00:11:03,232
The price of Pyeongyang naengmyeon is...

306
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,362
11 dollars.

307
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,263
- That's not bad. - That's right.

308
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,773
- This is good. - I told you, didn't I?

309
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:09,591
You must also set out now.

310
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:13,207
Please choose a dish that you will pay less than 11 dollars.

311
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:15,030
Jae Seok, what about the second place?

312
00:11:15,373 --> 00:11:16,929
Actually, there might be cheaper dishes...

313
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,442
- in higher places. - Is that so?

314
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:20,493
Yes, price-wise, it might be.

315
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,553
All right. Be quiet.

316
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,301
(All right. Be quiet.)

317
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,852
(You want me to be quiet?)

318
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,641
What? I've been quiet the whole time.

319
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:30,638
- I think what I just said was... - I'm sorry to say this.

320
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,563
- very important. - I'm sorry to say this.

321
00:11:32,564 --> 00:11:34,433
Why are you managing our members like that?

322
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,393
- Why? - "Members".

323
00:11:36,394 --> 00:11:38,232
- Why are you doing that? - Listen. Jae Seok...

324
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,495
pretends he's the team leader when he's with us.

325
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,421
- He thinks he's the king. - Wait.

326
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,564
- Who's the team leader here? - He thinks he's the king.

327
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,986
All right.

328
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:47,324
Listen up.

329
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,173
Given the members here...

330
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,883
(Bursting with laughter)

331
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,934
Listen. I'm the oldest here.

332
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:54,653
- I'm the oldest here. - Yes, you are.

333
00:11:54,654 --> 00:11:55,753
but you debuted later than I did.

334
00:11:55,754 --> 00:11:57,023
(Candidate 2, the weakling, Jae Seok)

335
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,639
- I... - I can't believe this.

336
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,510
Hey, I was born before you.

337
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,238
- I was born before you. - I...

338
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:03,663
- Listen. - How old is your son?

339
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:04,822
(Asking a question all of a sudden)

340
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:05,862
(That was sudden.)

341
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:06,974
- What did you say? - How old is your son?

342
00:12:07,064 --> 00:12:08,579
My son is 10 years old.

343
00:12:08,863 --> 00:12:10,633
My son is 17 years old.

344
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:12,702
(Seok Jin's son is 17 years old.)

345
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,926
- How dare you? - They're going to use that too?

346
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:16,732
- What are you doing? - My son...

347
00:12:16,733 --> 00:12:18,242
- Goodness. - What are you doing?

348
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:19,253
How many kids do you have?

349
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,842
- I have only 1. - I have 2.

350
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,313
- Come on! - He won.

351
00:12:22,314 --> 00:12:23,612
(That was a game changer.)

352
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:25,883
(Jae Seok is the team leader for having more kids.)

353
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:27,013
This is so annoying!

354
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,206
- Let's stop here. Let's stop. - This is so annoying!

355
00:12:29,254 --> 00:12:31,000
His second child can't even talk now.

356
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,482
Then...

357
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,705
why don't you choose, So Min?

358
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,106
I think second place might be good too.

359
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,567
- I'd go with 4th place. - 4th place?

360
00:12:37,193 --> 00:12:38,222
How about 8th place?

361
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:39,233
- What? - Eighth place.

362
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,192
(Booing)

363
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,293
- Stop it! Stop it! - Stop it! Stop it!

364
00:12:43,294 --> 00:12:46,163
(Criticizing Seok Jin)

365
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,154
Okay. 7th place. It's lucky 7.

366
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,803
- "Lucky"? - My goodness.

367
00:12:49,804 --> 00:12:51,872
- Stop it! Stop it! - Stop it! Stop it!

368
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:53,403
(Going against Seok Jin for no reason)

369
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,130
Unbelievable. Okay.

370
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:57,242
I'm number three.

371
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,342
- Quit! Quit! - Hey.

372
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,813
(Rejecting him since it's funny)

373
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,352
(Seok Jin explodes.)

374
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:03,425
Okay. Seok Jin chose...

375
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,397
third place. Let's go with that.

376
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,463
- 3rd place? - 3rd place.

377
00:13:06,823 --> 00:13:08,207
1, 2, 3.

378
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:11,898
(3rd place of unique Korean food foreigners want to try)

379
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:16,393
(What's the dish in the upper rankings?)

380
00:13:16,394 --> 00:13:19,293
(Fermented skate)

381
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:20,533
Fermented...

382
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:23,072
(A heavy sigh)

383
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,457
See? I told you.

384
00:13:24,743 --> 00:13:27,027
I can't eat that because my nose is sensitive.

385
00:13:27,514 --> 00:13:28,913
- I can't eat fermented skate. - I can't eat that.

386
00:13:28,914 --> 00:13:30,072
(I can't eat that either.)

387
00:13:30,073 --> 00:13:31,093
Hey.

388
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,482
How could you choose fermented skate...

389
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,913
- out of everything? - I can't eat that.

390
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,298
And that's expensive too.

391
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:38,070
- It's expensive. - It's really expensive.

392
00:13:38,723 --> 00:13:41,053
- We can't buy it for 11 dollars. - It's expensive.

393
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,144
That's a luxurious dish.

394
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:47,763
(The high price and its unique smell are the barriers to enjoy the dish.)

395
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:51,945
(It's a rare invigorating nutritious dish with addicting flavors.)

396
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:54,673
By the way, you haven't had fermented skate before?

397
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:55,815
I've never had it before.

398
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:57,356
You've never had it either, So Min?

399
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:58,716
This is terrible.

400
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,057
We all have to eat it, right?

401
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:01,872
- You can eat it, right? - I can.

402
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:02,954
I can eat it.

403
00:14:03,113 --> 00:14:05,513
- That's a lie. - I can.

404
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:08,079
- Of course, I can. - Just eat the skate itself.

405
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,482
Actually, we don't have money to buy other side dishes for skate.

406
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,023
(Actually, we don't have money to buy other side dishes for skate.)

407
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:13,153
That's true.

408
00:14:13,154 --> 00:14:15,192
- We can only order the skate. - That's right.

409
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:17,486
- We can only order that. - We must find a cheap place.

410
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,391
Are we close to Yangjae-dong from here?

411
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,133
- Yes, we're close. - I found...

412
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:23,649
- a skate restaurant here. - Tell me.

413
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,023
- We must check the price. - The price?

414
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:29,673
(They must eat the skate under 11 dollars.)

415
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,003
The braised skate is 80 dollars for 5 people.

416
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,418
(The braised skate is 80 dollars.)

417
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:35,572
- It's 50 dollars for 2 servings. - It's that expensive?

418
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,283
Of course, it's expensive I told you it's a luxurious dish.

419
00:14:38,284 --> 00:14:39,482
- This is a rare dish. - What else?

420
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:41,413
The fermented skate ramyeon is 10 dollars for 1 person.

421
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
(Eureka!)

422
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,337
- There's fermented skate ramyeon? - Fermented skate ramyeon.

423
00:14:45,524 --> 00:14:46,967
- Fermented skate ramyeon? - Is that acceptable?

424
00:14:47,323 --> 00:14:48,352
- If it has skate in it, it is. - Fermented skate ramyeon...

425
00:14:48,353 --> 00:14:50,293
I think I can eat it if it's in ramyeon.

426
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:51,577
- It's in Yangjae-dong? - Yes.

427
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:53,204
Let's go there.

428
00:14:53,564 --> 00:14:55,192
Let's go with fermented skate ramyeon.

429
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,403
We have no choice. That's the perfect price for us.

430
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:58,716
- It's only a dollar difference. - Let's go!

431
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:00,433
The fermented skate is so expensive.

432
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:01,584
(Team Jae Seok sets out to the restaurant.)

433
00:15:01,973 --> 00:15:04,003
By the end of February, winter will be over, right?

434
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,842
- It will be warm in March, right? - It will be cold until March.

435
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:07,513
- Until March? - It will be cold...

436
00:15:07,514 --> 00:15:09,029
until March.

437
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,925
Why are we going far?

438
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,082
You could've found a closer restaurant, So Min.

439
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,467
Why did you get a place so far away?

440
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:17,523
(Seok Jin ruins the friendly atmosphere.)

441
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,283
- Listen. - It's not that.

442
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,322
- We must pay less than 11 dollars. - The youngest...

443
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:23,793
The youngest has to be considerate.

444
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,122
There were other restaurants nearby.

445
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:27,893
- Those didn't serve the ramyeon. - If we had only the skate...

446
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:28,974
Should I look for one?

447
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,803
(Should I look for a fermented skate ramyeon restaurant nearby?)

448
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,102
- Go ahead. What if you don't? - What if I find one?

449
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:33,548
- What if there's one nearby? - What if there isn't?

450
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,045
If you can't find it, get a finger flick on your nose.

451
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,232
- Finger flick on the nose. - Get a finger flick.

452
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:38,527
- Okay. I got it. - It's a finger flick on the nose.

453
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,112
(Looking up cheap skate restaurants nearby)

454
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:42,224
"Fermented skate ramyeon".

455
00:15:43,014 --> 00:15:44,043
"Naju"?

456
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,442
(That's at least 300km away.)

457
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:46,656
Naju?

458
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,153
How is it in Naju?

459
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:49,952
"Eurwang-ri".

460
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:51,065
Eurwang-ri?

461
00:15:52,054 --> 00:15:54,719
- It can't be closer than Yangjae. - Right.

462
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,037
Let me call them.

463
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,153
If they have fermented skate ramyeon...

464
00:15:57,154 --> 00:16:00,492
(I found a fermented skate ramyeon restaurant.)

465
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,063
- Is it a bossam restaurant? - It's in Bangbae-dong.

466
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:03,192
(It's closer than Yangjae.)

467
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,702
Hello, this is bossam restaurant.

468
00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:07,300
Do you sell fermented skate ramyeon?

469
00:16:08,203 --> 00:16:12,446
(His nose depends on the answer.)

470
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:13,972
Yes, we have fermented skate with pork and kimchi.

471
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,225
I mean fermented skate ramyeon.

472
00:16:15,873 --> 00:16:17,072
Fermented skate ramyeon?

473
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:19,467
(She's never heard of it.)

474
00:16:20,144 --> 00:16:22,153
- You don't have it? - We have seafood ramyeon.

475
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:23,669
We don't have fermented skate ramyeon.

476
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,283
Okay, thank you.

477
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,023
I never heard of it, sir.

478
00:16:27,024 --> 00:16:29,523
(Seok Jin's nose will get hit.)

479
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:31,886
Okay, I'm sorry.

480
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,692
(Hanging up)

481
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,047
She never heard of it.

482
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,033
- She was upset. - She was quite angry.

483
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,477
You bothered her when she was busy.

484
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:41,072
- She thought he was joking. - There's no skate ramyeon.

485
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,588
Fermented skate ramyeon must be uncommon.

486
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:43,773
- Wait a minute. - Seok Jin.

487
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:45,543
- We'll hit you at the restaurant. - It will be a nose flick.

488
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:46,583
Let's go first.

489
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:49,212
I didn't know fermented skate ramyeon was so uncommon.

490
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:52,143
There isn't any. I never saw fermented skate ramyeon.

491
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,729
- I'm surprised there is any. - Here it is.

492
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,153
- We're here. - Here it is.

493
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:57,683
- It must be famous here. - Is this the restaurant?

494
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,037
It's famous. Let's get out.

495
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,047
- Fermented skate ramyeon? - I smell fermented skate.

496
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,203
Shall we go?

497
00:17:03,554 --> 00:17:04,906
This is it. Hello.

498
00:17:05,494 --> 00:17:06,736
This is the smell of fermented skate.

499
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,832
- Hello. - Hello.

500
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:11,429
There's a mild smell of fermented skate.

501
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:12,714
Ma'am?

502
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:16,533
We can only order one portion because we're shooting.

503
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:18,602
- I'm sorry. - Is there fermented skate ramyeon?

504
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,642
- Ramyeon. - We have fermented skate ramyeon.

505
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:24,513
We only serve ramyeon to those who order fermented skate.

506
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:27,612
(There's a condition to the order.)

507
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,082
- Is that so? - Goodness.

508
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:32,822
(You must order fermented skate to eat fermented skate ramyeon.)

509
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:35,278
You can only order it as an addition.

510
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:39,162
(It was on the menu.)

511
00:17:39,163 --> 00:17:42,293
(So they traveled far.)

512
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,203
(Will they fail their lowest cost mission?)

513
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,533
However, I'll serve it to you.

514
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,716
Thank you.

515
00:17:49,474 --> 00:17:50,842
(She serves fermented skate ramyeon especially to them.)

516
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:52,142
How much is it?

517
00:17:52,143 --> 00:17:53,285
It's 10 dollars per person.

518
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,572
- 10 dollars? - Yes.

519
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,443
- Thank you. - Thank you.

520
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,483
It isn't the main menu.

521
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:00,813
- Right. - It's because...

522
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:02,882
It's an additional dish.

523
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,783
- It's an additional order. - Let's penalize Seok Jin first.

524
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:05,894
Let's hit his nose.

525
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:08,223
- The nose flick. - No way. What are you doing?

526
00:18:08,224 --> 00:18:09,223
- I'll do it on behalf of everyone. - No.

527
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,453
I delegate the task to you.

528
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:13,150
So Min delegated it to me. Let me hit you once.

529
00:18:13,464 --> 00:18:15,453
The restaurant owner on the phone was...

530
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,418
- very angry. - Right.

531
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:18,763
She might track your number.

532
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,329
She thought that you were talking nonsense.

533
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,614
It doesn't hurt.

534
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,243
Face sideways.

535
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,543
(He's about to hit Seok Jin's nose.)

536
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,766
(Flicking)

537
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:32,142
(Screaming)

538
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,412
It must hurt.

539
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,313
- That was the worst. - It sounded like something popped.

540
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,483
(So Min gets even with him.)

541
00:18:36,484 --> 00:18:38,783
(The pain gets worse for Seok Jin.)

542
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,299
It sounded like something popped.

543
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,673
It sounded like a deflated balloon.

544
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:44,339
His nose dangled.

545
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:46,362
Are you okay?

546
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:48,263
His nose moved back and forth about three times.

547
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:49,592
It really hurts.

548
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,662
His nose vibrated like a punching bag.

549
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,553
I never got hit like this before.

550
00:18:53,603 --> 00:18:54,872
- Is it your first time? - Yes.

551
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:56,973
This will be our penalty for today.

552
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:58,084
Okay.

553
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,993
We can only order one?

554
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:03,912
I thought it meant one portion for each.

555
00:19:03,913 --> 00:19:05,459
- Me too. - Seriously.

556
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,342
It's unfortunate.

557
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:10,181
Shall we play a game and decide one person who doesn't eat?

558
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,767
- Haha. - One person doesn't eat?

559
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,783
- Two people shouldn't eat. - Shall we exclude two?

560
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:14,892
- Yes, exclude two people. - That sounds good.

561
00:19:14,893 --> 00:19:16,510
- Okay. - How about this?

562
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,840
Let's compete in teams.

563
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,679
How about based on where we're sitting?

564
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:23,722
(Haha and Se Chan versus Jong Kook and Ji Hyo)

565
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:24,874
How about based on where we're sitting?

566
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:27,383
Be quiet. There are many people.

567
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:28,932
Come on.

568
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,195
Hold hands, hold hands.

569
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:33,642
Let's exclude two people from eating.

570
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:34,987
- Let's do it. - I don't care.

571
00:19:35,444 --> 00:19:36,454
All right.

572
00:19:36,573 --> 00:19:38,043
(How will they pick two people?)

573
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,164
Let's pick a color.

574
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:43,682
Ask the restaurant owner to pick two colors.

575
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,822
- Shall we? - Okay.

576
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:45,953
There are five colors.

577
00:19:45,954 --> 00:19:48,145
- Pick any except black. - Except black.

578
00:19:48,623 --> 00:19:50,340
- I pick green. - Green?

579
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:51,592
I pick white.

580
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:53,643
- I pick red. - I'll pick blue.

581
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:57,763
Are the chosen colors excluded or will they get to eat?

582
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,703
They'll be excluded since it's a bomb.

583
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:01,622
- Mine is green. - Okay.

584
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,932
- The food is here. - Here it is.

585
00:20:03,933 --> 00:20:05,142
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon is served.)

586
00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,992
- Thank you. - Thank you.

587
00:20:08,314 --> 00:20:09,384
Look at the quality.

588
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,483
There are a lot of noodles.

589
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:12,827
It'll be enough for two people.

590
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:14,483
Two people will get to eat.

591
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:16,432
Gosh, look at the quality.

592
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:19,253
Sir?

593
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:20,283
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon tastes addicting.)

594
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:22,172
Since you're here,

595
00:20:22,653 --> 00:20:24,023
there's no other reason.

596
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:26,193
Do you see these four colors?

597
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,688
Among green, red, white, and blue,

598
00:20:29,234 --> 00:20:30,763
- could you pick 2? - Please pick 2.

599
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:31,963
Pick one first.

600
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,402
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon depends on his choice.)

601
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:38,313
(Which color will he choose?)

602
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:42,013
(The restaurant owner's first pick)

603
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:43,142
White.

604
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,426
What else?

605
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:45,524
What else? One more.

606
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:47,882
Green.

607
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:50,813
(He picks Haha's color green.)

608
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,053
- Okay. - Thank you.

609
00:20:52,054 --> 00:20:53,783
- Thank you. - Wait.

610
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:56,621
(Haha and Se Chan who proposed the game get eliminated.)

611
00:20:56,794 --> 00:20:59,348
(Ace and Champion get selected as usual.)

612
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,063
Goodness.

613
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:02,392
How could I be excluded?

614
00:21:02,393 --> 00:21:03,432
(It's our fault that we played a game with them.)

615
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:05,832
It's convenient for us to share.

616
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,621
This is creepy.

617
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,550
- We'll try. - We'll try some.

618
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,672
(He wets the noodles in cold broth.)

619
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,612
(He slurps noodles with some broth.)

620
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:17,291
It's driving me crazy.

621
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,243
(Jong Kook takes a bite.)

622
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,852
You should eat broth right away.

623
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:22,863
(Ji Hyo takes a bite.)

624
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,182
How are the noodles?

625
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,527
You should eat them when they're still wet with broth.

626
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:32,207
Dip them in the broth. It's good.

627
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,304
Dip them in?

628
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,733
It's great to see you share a bowl together.

629
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,874
(He keeps teasing them.)

630
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:41,033
(It only makes him laugh.)

631
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:44,306
It's nice to see them eat noodles together.

632
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:45,985
Are you done?

633
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,773
It was delicious.

634
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:51,177
Everyone, you finished one portion of Pyeongyang naengmyeon.

635
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:53,940
You may explode the opposing team's bomb.

636
00:21:54,143 --> 00:21:55,597
- Goodness. - Let's do it.

637
00:21:56,554 --> 00:21:57,783
- Red. - Red.

638
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,096
- Yellow. - Yellow.

639
00:22:00,123 --> 00:22:03,092
(If the opposing team's bomb explodes, )

640
00:22:03,093 --> 00:22:06,255
(today's race is over.)

641
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:08,763
(With one attack, )

642
00:22:08,764 --> 00:22:10,892
(they could explode the opposing team's bomb.)

643
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,102
Is it over if their bomb explodes?

644
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:13,245
- Yes. - It's over.

645
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,632
(The success rate is 20 percent.)

646
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:16,987
- We're in trouble. - We're in trouble.

647
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:23,112
Shall we try to explode the bomb?

648
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:24,172
(Which colored wire will they pick?)

649
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:26,412
- The restaurant owner had... - He chose well.

650
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,013
- good intuitions. - He's intuitive.

651
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,832
Let's ask him again.

652
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,646
Sir, last time...

653
00:22:32,754 --> 00:22:34,322
we asked you to pick two colors.

654
00:22:34,323 --> 00:22:35,809
- You picked two colors. - Yes.

655
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,744
Like last time, there's no pressure.

656
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,662
Could you pick one color?

657
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,332
Could you pick one color?

658
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,332
- Just one. - Yes.

659
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:44,819
Could you pick one?

660
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:49,446
(His choice could explode Team Jae Seok's bomb.)

661
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,043
(Team Jong Kook tries to explode Team Jae Seok's bomb.)

662
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:53,427
Just pick one? Okay.

663
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,572
(Which will he choose?)

664
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,503
- White. - White?

665
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:02,612
(Based on his intuition, )

666
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:05,148
(Team Jong Kook chooses the white wire.)

667
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:08,352
(Team Jae Seok must cut the white wire.)

668
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:09,808
Cut the white wire.

669
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:11,862
You cut it.

670
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:12,993
- So Min, you cut it. - Me?

671
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:14,134
You cut it, So Min.

672
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:17,020
- Shouldn't he cut it? - I'm scared.

673
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,563
Gosh, I'm scared.

674
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,303
(Is the white wire connected to the bomb?)

675
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:22,789
- Goodness. - Go.

676
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,016
- Please. - So Min.

677
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,072
Grab it like this.

678
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,243
(As soon as the bomb explodes, the race is over.)

679
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:29,354
- Use both hands. - I'm nervous.

680
00:23:31,814 --> 00:23:33,228
(Snapping)

681
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,453
- It's okay. - I knew it.

682
00:23:37,454 --> 00:23:38,635
(Team Jong Kook's attack fails.)

683
00:23:38,923 --> 00:23:40,872
What is it that makes me so nervous?

684
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,165
It makes me very nervous.

685
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,293
Right. It's too early to explode.

686
00:23:45,294 --> 00:23:47,041
- It's too early. - Right.

687
00:23:47,294 --> 00:23:48,343
Right.

688
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:50,693
You failed to explode their bomb.

689
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:52,785
You'll choose your next menu.

690
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:55,872
(Pyeongyang naengmyeon and fermented skate are chosen.)

691
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:57,186
Third was fermented skate.

692
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,503
We picked the on with lower ranks.

693
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,766
- One of these? - Let's choose one of them.

694
00:24:02,214 --> 00:24:03,992
Since we picked the bottom, how about the sixth?

695
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:05,382
Shall we pick the sixth place?

696
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:07,142
- Sixth place sounds good. - That sounds good.

697
00:24:07,143 --> 00:24:08,152
In 1, 2, 3.

698
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,953
(Which Korean food ranked 6th that foreigners want to try?)

699
00:24:09,954 --> 00:24:10,953
Jokbal?

700
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:13,145
(6th place is jokbal.)

701
00:24:13,754 --> 00:24:17,493
(Dark meat that's shiny and moist)

702
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:21,432
(A combination of skin, fat, and meat that spreads in the mouth)

703
00:24:21,734 --> 00:24:23,993
Isn't this quite expensive?

704
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:26,632
- Really? - Jokbal is quite expensive.

705
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,662
(Team Jae Seok won 10 dollars.)

706
00:24:27,663 --> 00:24:29,773
Search for jokbal restaurants.

707
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:32,269
(It has to be lower than 10 dollars.)

708
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:34,743
- It's 28 dollars. - It's 22 dollars.

709
00:24:34,744 --> 00:24:36,027
10 dollars.

710
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:38,460
- Is there a 10-dollar one? - Wait.

711
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:40,582
Jokbal is expensive.

712
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,253
(Team Jong Kook is at risk.)

713
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:44,582
Jokbal? Wait a minute.

714
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:48,058
(Can they find jokbal that costs less than 10 dollars?)

715
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,493
All right.

716
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:52,293
Everyone, you found a fermented skate dish...

717
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:53,622
for 10 dollars.

718
00:24:53,623 --> 00:24:56,088
- Do you remember the rules? - Pardon?

719
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:57,850
One of you have...

720
00:24:58,034 --> 00:24:59,533
- a Penalty Exemption Card. - Right.

721
00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:02,332
- You can be exempted... - Even if you lose.

722
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,703
- from a penalty even if you lose. - Right.

723
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,443
How can we gain it?

724
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,695
The person who has it...

725
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:09,973
at the last moment...

726
00:25:09,974 --> 00:25:11,862
- will be exempted. - I'll hold it.

727
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,705
(Everyone gets defensive.)

728
00:25:15,183 --> 00:25:16,382
The person who has it should decide.

729
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,152
- Put it down. - For now.

730
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:19,422
The person who has it should decide.

731
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:20,983
- Put it down. - Don't touch it.

732
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:22,336
We should choose the person who will keep it.

733
00:25:23,254 --> 00:25:24,839
- The one who will keep it? - Yes.

734
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:26,912
When fermented skate ramyeon is served,

735
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,533
- we'll have some. - Okay.

736
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,432
Anyone who can't eat it,

737
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,303
or anyone who makes a face after eating fermented skate.

738
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:34,646
It's very delicious.

739
00:25:34,873 --> 00:25:36,503
- Okay. - It really is.

740
00:25:36,504 --> 00:25:37,872
Those people will be eliminated.

741
00:25:37,873 --> 00:25:39,893
You must enjoy it like you're on a commercial.

742
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,699
- For example... - You can't make a face.

743
00:25:42,944 --> 00:25:45,043
You can't make a face. You must smile.

744
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:48,113
I wonder how fermented skate ramyeon will taste.

745
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,213
- I have no idea at all. - Right.

746
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:52,002
- I have no idea. - You never tried it.

747
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:54,122
- It's my first time. - Okay.

748
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:55,723
I might be at an advantage.

749
00:25:55,724 --> 00:25:57,753
- I wonder. - I can imagine that it's tasty...

750
00:25:57,754 --> 00:25:59,063
- as it's my first time eating it. - Okay, that sounds good.

751
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,822
- It's coming. - There's kimchi.

752
00:26:00,823 --> 00:26:03,661
(Fermented skate ramyeon is served.)

753
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:05,775
It looks good.

754
00:26:06,804 --> 00:26:09,056
- Gosh. - Rice cakes and mushrooms.

755
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:12,172
- It looks like... - There's a lot inside.

756
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:13,587
Is this the smell of fermented skate?

757
00:26:14,343 --> 00:26:17,373
(It looks like regular ramyeon.)

758
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:22,301
(It's full of fermented skate that tastes stronger as it's cooked.)

759
00:26:22,984 --> 00:26:25,223
(It looks like...)

760
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:26,852
(That's...)

761
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:27,852
(She can't finish her sentence.)

762
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,470
Is this it?

763
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:31,322
(He puts his hand on his nose.)

764
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:33,081
It starts now.

765
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,987
What do you mean it starts now?

766
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,503
- It started. - Fermented skate is cooked.

767
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:41,033
It's served cooked.

768
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:43,473
Of course it's cooked when it's served in ramyeon.

769
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:45,292
It wouldn't be served raw.

770
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:49,150
I never thought of cooking fermented skate.

771
00:26:50,014 --> 00:26:51,582
Have a piece.

772
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:53,098
I'll try fermented skate.

773
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:55,333
Take one piece of it. Try it.

774
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:00,149
(She's more nervous than when she cut the bomb wire.)

775
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,035
(Sniffing)

776
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:04,875
No.

777
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:08,793
(The smell brings back memories.)

778
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,682
No, that's not it.

779
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:13,063
- Didn't you make a face? - I didn't.

780
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,203
- Really? - I was short on breath.

781
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:18,203
- Any minor changes count. - Let's start.

782
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,122
- Take it. - Start.

783
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:23,043
(He hesitates as he tries to eat it.)

784
00:27:23,044 --> 00:27:24,488
- Gosh. - It's a little...

785
00:27:25,514 --> 00:27:26,927
The smell is already strong.

786
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,082
You must eat it in five seconds.

787
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,931
Try some broth and fermented skate.

788
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:33,850
Any minor changes or if you don't eat it in five seconds.

789
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:36,781
5, 4, 3,

790
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:38,403
- Two. - He ate it.

791
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,592
(His lips are attached to the plate.)

792
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,179
It's strange.

793
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,987
- Goodness. - You have to finish it.

794
00:27:47,504 --> 00:27:50,233
You must eat it in five seconds.

795
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,456
(It's a festival of fermented skate.)

796
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:55,013
- It smells so strong. - It's very strong.

797
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,443
(The traces of the festival remain.)

798
00:27:56,444 --> 00:27:57,757
He's eliminated.

799
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,912
- Why? - Seok Jin is eliminated.

800
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,352
(He moaned while eating.)

801
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:04,273
Seok Jin is eliminated.

802
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:07,006
- He can't eat it. - Seok Jin is eliminated.

803
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,253
Right.

804
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,822
(No one can eat it calmly.)

805
00:28:09,823 --> 00:28:11,622
- Seok Jin. - No one can eat it calmly.

806
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,946
(The smell is very strong without eating it.)

807
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,592
- It's strong when it's cooked. - Seok Jin.

808
00:28:16,593 --> 00:28:17,932
I'm serious.

809
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:21,332
- Jae Seok is crying. - I can't believe it.

810
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:22,444
Seok Jin is eliminated.

811
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,669
- You know what? - It must be very strong.

812
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,943
Is there any water?

813
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,762
- I'm sorry. - You can't drink it.

814
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:30,743
- That's not polite. - You can't drink water.

815
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:32,882
- Ma'am, please give me some water. - She served the food.

816
00:28:32,883 --> 00:28:35,135
She already did what wasn't possible.

817
00:28:35,314 --> 00:28:37,273
She made it specially for us.

818
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,453
- It's a precious dish. - May I get some water?

819
00:28:39,454 --> 00:28:40,969
- It's not allowed. - Please.

820
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:42,666
I need water.

821
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:44,605
You know what?

822
00:28:44,794 --> 00:28:46,862
(He takes quite a lot.)

823
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:49,332
- This is not easy. - I like ramyeon.

824
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:50,909
- And? - Also...

825
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:54,602
I spent my adolescence with fermented skate.

826
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:56,018
What?

827
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:58,642
("Yu Jae Seok Spent His Adolescence with Fermented Skate.")

828
00:28:58,643 --> 00:29:00,592
- What? - How?

829
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:03,773
I had it for the first time at my cousin's wedding.

830
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:07,146
I became a fan of fermented skate as I couldn't forget its taste.

831
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:09,271
I have been its fan.

832
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:12,753
Wait, your nose is running. It must smell strong.

833
00:29:12,754 --> 00:29:14,582
(Are you really a fan of fermented skate?)

834
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,822
He's crying already.

835
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,611
All right. Let's see.

836
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:21,246
I like fermented skate very much.

837
00:29:21,464 --> 00:29:22,645
It starts now.

838
00:29:22,964 --> 00:29:24,650
(He hesitates.)

839
00:29:26,903 --> 00:29:30,105
I'm smiling because I haven't had it in a while.

840
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:31,686
My mouth is watering.

841
00:29:31,873 --> 00:29:34,227
Do you know what his expression means?

842
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:36,261
It's when he's dumbfounded.

843
00:29:37,244 --> 00:29:38,527
My mouth is already watering.

844
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:41,882
There are many who can't eat fermented skate,

845
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:43,530
but I like it very much.

846
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,753
Is that so?

847
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:45,794
(He eats it in one bite.)

848
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:49,477
(He slurps in the noodles like a noodle fan.)

849
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,961
(It's about time that he reacted.)

850
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:57,079
Let's watch him until he swallows it.

851
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:58,563
(He shows a big smile.)

852
00:29:58,564 --> 00:29:59,613
He'll react soon.

853
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,088
He's lying. It's still in his cheeks.

854
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,572
- It's still in his cheeks. - Really?

855
00:30:06,573 --> 00:30:07,583
In his cheeks.

856
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:09,642
(He's very moved.)

857
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,213
This is what it tastes like.

858
00:30:11,214 --> 00:30:12,243
(Impressed)

859
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,243
(This is what it tastes like.)

860
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,612
This is what it tastes like.

861
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:15,953
(Surprised)

862
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:17,367
- Gosh. - Jae Seok.

863
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:19,241
When he made that sound...

864
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:21,401
It's like he punched me in the nose.

865
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,543
This is what it tastes like.

866
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:24,704
It's interesting.

867
00:30:25,264 --> 00:30:26,963
When it's cooked with ramyeon,

868
00:30:26,964 --> 00:30:29,092
- fermented skate tastes piquant. - Does it taste strong?

869
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,293
- It still tastes strong. - Is it piquant?

870
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,779
Next is So Min.

871
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:34,653
They make it well.

872
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:36,902
- Here you go. - That's a big piece.

873
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,642
- It's big. - It's too big.

874
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:40,102
Yours wasn't this big, Jae Seok.

875
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:41,443
- I know. - This is good.

876
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:44,242
If So Min endures it, she'll be eligible too.

877
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:45,842
Yes, all right.

878
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:48,480
(So Min's laughter is mysterious.)

879
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,876
Try some with ramyeon.

880
00:30:52,323 --> 00:30:55,051
When it's cooked with ramyeon...

881
00:30:56,353 --> 00:30:57,993
I shouldn't have smelled it.

882
00:30:57,994 --> 00:30:59,307
(The smell is strong.)

883
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,432
(It's the first time a smell makes her laugh.)

884
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:03,575
Isn't it strong?

885
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,003
(Will she give up?)

886
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,851
- It's strong. - You must eat it in five seconds.

887
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,727
I'm in trouble. I can't eat fermented skate.

888
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:13,265
5, 4.

889
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,438
(She tries it.)

890
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:18,342
Start.

891
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:19,943
(Noodles taste like fermented skate.)

892
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:20,943
The fermented skate is at the bottom.

893
00:31:20,944 --> 00:31:24,417
- It's at the bottom. - She's doing well.

894
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:27,223
Try the fermented skate.

895
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:29,723
Eat fermented skate and eat the broth.

896
00:31:29,724 --> 00:31:31,322
(No minor changes are allowed to win Penalty Exemption Card.)

897
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,586
- Is it delicious? - Keep eating it.

898
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:36,493
(The taste is released.)

899
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,533
Is this it?

900
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:38,733
(It's been hiding for a long time.)

901
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:41,229
(Her wrinkles start to form.)

902
00:31:41,504 --> 00:31:43,233
(She stays calm.)

903
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,496
- Let's see. - I think she made a face.

904
00:31:45,544 --> 00:31:47,463
All right.

905
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:50,638
What's going on? What was that face?

906
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:53,409
What's wrong with your eyes?

907
00:31:53,683 --> 00:31:55,532
Her whole face is twisting.

908
00:31:57,613 --> 00:31:59,122
(There was a second risky moment.)

909
00:31:59,123 --> 00:32:01,152
- I think she succeeded. - Once you eat that much,

910
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,392
- you can finish it. - Seriously.

911
00:32:03,393 --> 00:32:05,615
So Min passed. Next is Kwang Soo.

912
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,711
- She did a good job. - Come close.

913
00:32:08,123 --> 00:32:10,162
I don't know anything about fermented skate.

914
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:11,733
This must be your first time.

915
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,803
- The ignorant are brave. - Right.

916
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:15,003
I can imagine that it's delicious.

917
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:17,703
- It makes you laugh. - Try it.

918
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:20,243
- My nostrils opened up. - Mine too.

919
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:21,943
- Is this your first time eating it? - Right.

920
00:32:21,944 --> 00:32:23,513
Kwang Soo never had fermented skate before.

921
00:32:23,514 --> 00:32:26,842
There are many who never had...

922
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,142
- fermented skate. - Right.

923
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:30,002
- It's spicy. - Eat it as is.

924
00:32:30,054 --> 00:32:32,276
Don't smell it and just eat it.

925
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:33,682
- Eat it right away. - Don't hesitate.

926
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:34,865
Eat it directly.

927
00:32:36,153 --> 00:32:37,953
What did I just smell?

928
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,185
(But what did I just smell?)

929
00:32:40,494 --> 00:32:42,109
What was it?

930
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:44,193
- Is this fermented skate? - Yes.

931
00:32:44,194 --> 00:32:46,254
- It's how it smells. - Kwang Soo.

932
00:32:47,034 --> 00:32:49,533
- It's interesting. - Do you still taste it?

933
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,968
I never knew that ramyeon would taste like this.

934
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,142
- Okay, I can eat it. - Of course.

935
00:32:55,143 --> 00:32:56,672
There are people who like it.

936
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:58,935
- People who like it would enjoy it. - Right.

937
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:01,202
- I'll eat it in one go. - Blood will circulate in your body.

938
00:33:01,583 --> 00:33:03,936
5, 4, 3.

939
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:06,363
That's right.

940
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:10,152
(He should feel it by now.)

941
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:11,862
- Kwang Soo... - You need to chew it.

942
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:14,092
never had fermented skate before.

943
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,592
His eyes suddenly turned red.

944
00:33:16,593 --> 00:33:18,451
What's wrong? Why did your eyes turn red?

945
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:21,155
(It's for Penalty Exemption Card.)

946
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:23,926
- He's eliminated. - Smile.

947
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,243
Isn't it delicious?

948
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:26,602
(He smiles.)

949
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,370
- You should chew it. - Swallow it. You should chew it.

950
00:33:29,613 --> 00:33:31,682
You should eat it.

951
00:33:31,683 --> 00:33:32,783
(All he has to do is chew and swallow it.)

952
00:33:32,784 --> 00:33:33,842
I can't do it.

953
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:36,541
(He declares to give up.)

954
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:40,152
- He's eliminated. - He's eliminated.

955
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:41,910
- Kwang Soo. - He's out.

956
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,422
Is it normal that your nose becomes runny?

957
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,662
Your nostrils open up.

958
00:33:45,663 --> 00:33:48,092
- Is that why? - Your nostrils open up.

959
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,793
Don't you feel refreshed?

960
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,106
Right, I feel something.

961
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,649
I feel like something is going down.

962
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:56,473
- Look at this. - Eating it for the first time...

963
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,233
(Two people are addicted to fermented skate.)

964
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,859
(Slurping)

965
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:01,743
- You really enjoy it. - Right?

966
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:03,112
- You enjoy it a lot. - It's delicious.

967
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:04,255
In that case...

968
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:05,443
(He drinks fermented skate ramyeon.)

969
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,727
He really enjoys it.

970
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:10,253
(He falls in love with fermented skate ramyeon.)

971
00:34:10,254 --> 00:34:11,983
This is really a delicacy.

972
00:34:11,984 --> 00:34:13,552
(I want to eat it easily too.)

973
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,593
People who like it would love it.

974
00:34:15,594 --> 00:34:16,753
- Gosh. - That's interesting.

975
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,157
Gosh, that was a great meal.

976
00:34:20,194 --> 00:34:22,162
- Jae Seok finished the whole bowl. - He ate it all.

977
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,733
It's interesting that he enjoys it.

978
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:26,127
It's one of you two.

979
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,100
You can keep it for now.

980
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,872
- Okay. - He enjoyed it the most.

981
00:34:30,873 --> 00:34:31,943
- Right. - I enjoyed it the most.

982
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:34,630
- Let's see what happens next. - Okay.

983
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,912
Can we make a choice now?

984
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:39,543
- Yes. - We can pick the wire color.

985
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,383
- It should be snapped. - We have to explode their bomb.

986
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:43,595
We must snap their wire.

987
00:34:43,754 --> 00:34:46,379
No way, no way.

988
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:49,593
Which color shall we pick? Pick one, and one that remains will be it.

989
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:50,633
I pick green.

990
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:53,311
- Green is excluded. - Green is excluded.

991
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,988
- I pick blue. - Blue is excluded.

992
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:58,785
- I pick white. - I pick red.

993
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:01,432
- Exclude red. - Then we must cut black.

994
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,802
(They choose black wire.)

995
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:04,944
Cut the black wire.

996
00:35:05,574 --> 00:35:06,843
No way. Please.

997
00:35:06,844 --> 00:35:08,429
(Team Jae Seok cuts the black wire.)

998
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,943
No way.

999
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:12,660
(Haha is the worst coward.)

1000
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,313
(Team Jae Seok's first attack)

1001
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:18,950
(Will they explode their bomb?)

1002
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,852
(Black wire is...)

1003
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,014
(cut.)

1004
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:25,793
(The bomb doesn't explode.)

1005
00:35:25,794 --> 00:35:28,895
(Team Jae Seok's attack fails.)

1006
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,832
That wasn't it.

1007
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,403
It's better not to explode it yet.

1008
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:35,372
- It can't explode in the beginning. - I agree.

1009
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:37,050
- It'll get difficult. - Right.

1010
00:35:37,473 --> 00:35:41,513
(Each team has 4 wires left.)

1011
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:42,742
I think it's in the building.

1012
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,642
Let's go downstairs.

1013
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,058
- Let's go. - Okay.

1014
00:35:46,283 --> 00:35:48,653
There are so many restaurants here.

1015
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:50,052
(They go down to the basement of the shopping mall.)

1016
00:35:50,053 --> 00:35:51,113
A place like this...

1017
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:53,682
- It's been such a long time. - Right?

1018
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:55,310
Restaurants in the basement...

1019
00:35:55,993 --> 00:35:58,144
Incredible. It's this place.

1020
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:59,762
Hello.

1021
00:35:59,763 --> 00:36:01,593
- Hello. - Hello.

1022
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,093
We'll sit in a corner.

1023
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,193
- Okay. - Thank you.

1024
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:05,503
(They found this place after a lot of internet searching.)

1025
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,846
Hello. Enjoy your meal.

1026
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,633
- It looks nice. - It looks so tasty.

1027
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,472
Places like this are usually good.

1028
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,321
Hey, this place is perfect.

1029
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,073
- A jokbal set costs eight dollars. - There it is.

1030
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:17,225
(A jokbal set costs 8 dollars.)

1031
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,007
There it is. Eight dollars.

1032
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:22,552
We'll have a jokbal set.

1033
00:36:22,553 --> 00:36:24,603
(Team Jong Kook orders a jokbal set that costs 8 dollars.)

1034
00:36:25,424 --> 00:36:27,452
Sadly, the bomb didn't go off.

1035
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:28,793
- All right. - That's good.

1036
00:36:28,794 --> 00:36:30,122
- It's okay. - It's still in the beginning.

1037
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:32,244
If it goes off too early, things would get complicated.

1038
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,179
And Team Jong Kook's...

1039
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:35,832
next dish is...

1040
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,262
- Jokbal? - It's expensive.

1041
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,233
- Jokbal is expensive. - Jokbal under 10 dollars...

1042
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,032
- would be hard to find. - That'd be hard.

1043
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,302
Except at convenience stores.

1044
00:36:42,303 --> 00:36:45,131
Team Jong Kook managed to find...

1045
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:48,003
an eight-dollar jokbal set.

1046
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,073
- Did they go to a market? - A jokbal set?

1047
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:52,012
- It must be... - Right.

1048
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,713
served on a small plate.

1049
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,935
- Right. With a bowl of rice. - Yes.

1050
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:59,153
- With a bit of jokbal. - So you can have a taste.

1051
00:36:59,154 --> 00:37:00,567
I'm sure beondegi is on the list.

1052
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,193
- It has to be. - That would...

1053
00:37:02,194 --> 00:37:04,174
lower the price a lot.

1054
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:05,923
- It'd make things harder for them. - Exactly.

1055
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:07,944
- It'd be hard. - I agree.

1056
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,314
- What about this one? - Let's go for that.

1057
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:12,724
- You want number five? - Yes. Right above jokbal.

1058
00:37:12,833 --> 00:37:14,782
- I don't want to go below. - Okay.

1059
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,086
- All right. - Okay.

1060
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:17,802
- Let's go right above. - Number five.

1061
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:18,872
So Min.

1062
00:37:18,873 --> 00:37:20,056
- You open it. - I'll...

1063
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:21,503
1, 2, 3.

1064
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:24,473
(Is it something cheap?)

1065
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,543
Cheong...

1066
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,603
(Cheonggukjang)

1067
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:30,713
(Korean soul food)

1068
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:32,222
(It tastes like home.)

1069
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:34,452
(The strong smell might put you off at first, )

1070
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,615
(but you'll love it once you taste it.)

1071
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:38,793
(It's pretty cheap.)

1072
00:37:38,794 --> 00:37:40,177
- It's... - It's not bad.

1073
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:41,634
It's good.

1074
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,445
It's good, but...

1075
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,724
- the smell... - It's too strong.

1076
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:48,133
- This side... - The smell...

1077
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,184
It's too strong.

1078
00:37:49,674 --> 00:37:52,400
I love cheonggukjang,

1079
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,492
but cheonggukjang right after fermented skate?

1080
00:37:54,643 --> 00:37:57,269
Our breath will smell so bad today.

1081
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:59,429
- Right after fermented skate... - When we talk...

1082
00:37:59,484 --> 00:38:01,160
It's a fermented food day.

1083
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:04,782
- But the price is nice. - It's perfect.

1084
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,452
- It usually costs 6 or 7 dollars. - 6 dollars...

1085
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,983
We could get a small one.

1086
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:09,323
It's easy to find one that costs six dollars.

1087
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:10,940
- Where should we go? - Do you want to search first?

1088
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:13,323
- We should. - Where should we go?

1089
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,314
Do you remember that cheonggukjang place?

1090
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,247
- At Sinsa-dong Intersection. - At Sinsa-dong Intersection.

1091
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,525
- In Sinsa-dong... - There is a famous place.

1092
00:38:19,803 --> 00:38:21,420
- It's open 24 hours a day. - On the food street.

1093
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:23,972
We'd go there after nightclubs.

1094
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:25,085
We went there often.

1095
00:38:25,274 --> 00:38:26,702
The cheonggukjang set...

1096
00:38:26,703 --> 00:38:27,916
- was amazing. - Yes.

1097
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:29,457
- You went to nightclubs together? - Nightclubs.

1098
00:38:30,044 --> 00:38:31,185
- Yes. - Why did you...

1099
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,157
have to cause the businesses such trouble?

1100
00:38:33,214 --> 00:38:34,213
Hey.

1101
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:35,799
(They should compensate.)

1102
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,327
- Hey. - Hold on.

1103
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:40,782
- We were VIPs. - This is crazy.

1104
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:43,793
- My gosh. - You should have gone separately.

1105
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:45,222
(This is how the VIPs looked.)

1106
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,193
- You don't seem to know. - It's driving me crazy.

1107
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,193
Hey.

1108
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,593
- It must have been dark. - Yes.

1109
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,963
(The memories are distorted.)

1110
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:52,202
That's right.

1111
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,344
(They might have looked okay.)

1112
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,503
- Should we go there? - How much does it cost?

1113
00:38:55,504 --> 00:38:57,073
I think it costs 6 to 7 dollars.

1114
00:38:57,074 --> 00:38:58,332
- But... - If it's cheap...

1115
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,503
- it's been too long. - "Handmade traditional"...

1116
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,432
- Try calling them. - I'll call them.

1117
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:05,543
- They sell soy sauce crabs too. - That sounds great.

1118
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:07,343
(They call the cheonggukjang place from their memories.)

1119
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:08,797
- Hello. - Hello.

1120
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:10,753
- Is this a cheonggukjang place? - Yes.

1121
00:39:10,754 --> 00:39:13,784
May I ask how much a bowl of cheonggukjang is?

1122
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,552
(He as at least a VIP at this cheonggukjang place.)

1123
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:18,052
(How much is a bowl of cheonggukjang?)

1124
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:19,563
- 1 portion? - Yes.

1125
00:39:19,564 --> 00:39:21,240
It's eight dollars.

1126
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,693
(8 dollars per portion)

1127
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,249
- Okay. - Eight...

1128
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:27,762
That's too bad.

1129
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:29,133
- It's close from here too. - It's eight dollars.

1130
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,417
It's a good place.

1131
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:31,872
- Their cheonggukjang tastes great. - Let me try another place.

1132
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,073
- Where is it? - I don't know exactly.

1133
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,202
It's around Yangjae-dong.

1134
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:35,573
(How will it go this time?)

1135
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:38,139
- Is this a cheonggukjang place? - Yes.

1136
00:39:38,174 --> 00:39:40,203
How much is a bowl of cheonggukjang?

1137
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:46,923
(Will it be under 8 dollars this time?)

1138
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:48,843
- It's seven dollars. - Okay.

1139
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,122
(7 dollars)

1140
00:39:50,123 --> 00:39:52,215
Okay. Is the restaurant open?

1141
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:53,693
Yes.

1142
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:54,992
Thank you.

1143
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,363
(They found a 7-dollar cheonggukjang.)

1144
00:39:56,364 --> 00:39:57,593
- It's perfect. - We're done.

1145
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:59,250
- It's close from here. - It's close from here.

1146
00:39:59,433 --> 00:40:00,575
Let's go.

1147
00:40:00,634 --> 00:40:01,762
- Incredible. - Perfect.

1148
00:40:01,763 --> 00:40:02,945
(They move to the cheonggukjang place.)

1149
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:05,415
A jokbal set.

1150
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,213
Well...

1151
00:40:07,643 --> 00:40:09,443
How about the two people the owner chooses eat?

1152
00:40:09,444 --> 00:40:12,311
(The two people the owner chooses will eat.)

1153
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:14,024
And let's keep our colors.

1154
00:40:14,384 --> 00:40:15,394
- Okay. - Okay.

1155
00:40:15,884 --> 00:40:17,512
- We'll keep our colors? - Yes.

1156
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:18,852
(Jong Kook: blue, Ji Hyo: red, Haha: green, Se Chan: white)

1157
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,802
- Excuse me. - Sir, will you please...

1158
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:23,852
choose 2 colors out of these 4...

1159
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:25,712
- except black? - Please choose two.

1160
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,136
- You want me to choose? - Yes, please.

1161
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:30,118
Please think first.

1162
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:33,229
You can just choose whatever comes to your mind.

1163
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:34,574
Green.

1164
00:40:35,404 --> 00:40:37,393
- Your first choice is green? - And the other?

1165
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,532
The other?

1166
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:42,613
(His first choice is Haha. Who else will eat?)

1167
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:43,642
White.

1168
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:46,341
(It's Se Chan's color.)

1169
00:40:46,484 --> 00:40:47,582
(Haha and Se Chan will eat.)

1170
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:48,682
What is this?

1171
00:40:48,683 --> 00:40:50,198
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

1172
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:51,983
(It's those two this time?)

1173
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:53,903
It's unbelievable.

1174
00:40:53,924 --> 00:40:55,064
I can't believe it.

1175
00:40:55,424 --> 00:40:56,463
Hey.

1176
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,543
- I was relaxed, right? - You were.

1177
00:40:58,594 --> 00:41:01,423
They must be the colors restaurant owners like.

1178
00:41:01,424 --> 00:41:03,313
- That's incredible. - Green and white.

1179
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:05,176
- The food is here. - It's here.

1180
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,802
- It's here. - It's here.

1181
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:07,843
There's tteokbokki too.

1182
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:09,384
What's that?

1183
00:41:10,103 --> 00:41:11,750
This costs only eight dollars?

1184
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,328
- It's a lot of food. - Unbelievable.

1185
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:16,057
Is it time for us to enjoy the food?

1186
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:19,129
Okay, well...

1187
00:41:20,013 --> 00:41:21,943
- Oh, my. - What is this?

1188
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:23,833
(All the other 2 can eat is the side dishes.)

1189
00:41:24,013 --> 00:41:25,972
- There aren't many slices. - The anchovies taste good.

1190
00:41:26,924 --> 00:41:28,082
There you go.

1191
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,104
(Munching)

1192
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,952
(Se Chan takes a big bite.)

1193
00:41:31,953 --> 00:41:33,640
It's high-quality.

1194
00:41:34,163 --> 00:41:37,123
It's amazing that they have a jokbal set.

1195
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:38,832
It tastes amazing.

1196
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,932
The skin is so chewy.

1197
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,403
One is not enough.

1198
00:41:41,404 --> 00:41:42,573
(Haha wraps some jokbal in lettuce.)

1199
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,532
- With some dried radish... - Slow down.

1200
00:41:44,533 --> 00:41:46,673
- Why? - It'll run out soon.

1201
00:41:46,674 --> 00:41:48,472
(Meanwhile, the other two...)

1202
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:50,060
Then I'll eat the tteokbokki.

1203
00:41:50,444 --> 00:41:51,727
Let me have a taste.

1204
00:41:51,973 --> 00:41:54,443
Tell us if you want some.

1205
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:55,582
The food is running out.

1206
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,573
Who wants some?

1207
00:41:58,114 --> 00:42:00,003
- Who wants some? - Raise your right hand.

1208
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,638
If you want some...

1209
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:02,903
What should we do?

1210
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,435
I'll make them hold hands.

1211
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:05,837
The two of you...

1212
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,262
(What is it?)

1213
00:42:08,263 --> 00:42:10,213
You'll play rock-paper-scissors.

1214
00:42:10,464 --> 00:42:11,706
The winner can eat.

1215
00:42:12,234 --> 00:42:13,244
But...

1216
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,472
you have to hold your hands.

1217
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:16,514
Forget it.

1218
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:21,030
(Forget it.)

1219
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,813
(I'd rather not eat.)

1220
00:42:22,814 --> 00:42:23,824
I don't want it.

1221
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:27,240
- Then... - Just your little fingers.

1222
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:29,383
- Just your little fingers. - Make a pinky promise.

1223
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:30,828
- The winner will feed the other. - We're one forever.

1224
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:32,094
You won't run away.

1225
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,052
- We're a team. - Play rock-paper-scissors...

1226
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,693
Why do we have to play rock-paper-scissors?

1227
00:42:35,694 --> 00:42:37,122
- Let's just do it. Let's eat. - Yes!

1228
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:38,205
This is nothing.

1229
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:41,293
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo make a pinky promise.)

1230
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:43,454
(This is nothing.)

1231
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:45,719
(There you go.)

1232
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:47,233
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

1233
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,472
(It's supposed to be nothing, )

1234
00:42:49,473 --> 00:42:52,003
(but why does it make our hearts flutter?)

1235
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,673
(The winner is...)

1236
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:56,043
(Jong Kook.)

1237
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:57,084
You won again?

1238
00:42:58,274 --> 00:42:59,313
You can eat.

1239
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:00,324
(Casually)

1240
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:01,856
No. You eat.

1241
00:43:02,953 --> 00:43:06,182
(Hold on.)

1242
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:07,222
(Why did they even play rock-paper-scissors?)

1243
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:09,552
This isn't what we were expecting.

1244
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,593
(No one has to force them anymore.)

1245
00:43:11,594 --> 00:43:12,734
I'm okay.

1246
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,540
- You won anyway. - I don't even want it that much.

1247
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,156
- You can eat. - Then...

1248
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:19,133
Then...

1249
00:43:19,134 --> 00:43:20,951
let's have it between you two...

1250
00:43:21,603 --> 00:43:23,003
(The game never ends.)

1251
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,085
The jokbal game.

1252
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:25,655
- The fun jokbal game. - Fine, I'll stop.

1253
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:28,695
You eat. I'm okay.

1254
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:31,265
- No. - It's okay. Eat.

1255
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,727
- It'll be tasty. - Try it.

1256
00:43:33,283 --> 00:43:36,153
(While Team Jong Kook is being romantic...)

1257
00:43:36,154 --> 00:43:37,193
- Does it taste good? - Really?

1258
00:43:39,254 --> 00:43:40,782
- We're here. - I'm craving for cheonggukjang.

1259
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:42,392
- We're here? - I want cheonggukjang.

1260
00:43:42,393 --> 00:43:43,622
(An aura of tradition)

1261
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:44,937
It's a good restaurant. Let's go in.

1262
00:43:45,794 --> 00:43:46,892
(We're here to try the 7-dollar cheonggukjang.)

1263
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:49,332
- Hello. - Hello.

1264
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,832
We're sorry.

1265
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,126
- Hello. - Hello.

1266
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:56,654
- There are other customers. - We're sorry.

1267
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:58,602
A set of cheonggukjang, bossam, and rice with vegetables...

1268
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,702
costs only seven dollars?

1269
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,421
- That sounds amazing. - That's so cheap.

1270
00:44:01,643 --> 00:44:03,936
- Are we getting that? - Of course.

1271
00:44:03,973 --> 00:44:06,043
We'll have one portion.

1272
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,559
- We're sorry. - We're sorry.

1273
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:08,795
Thank you.

1274
00:44:09,683 --> 00:44:11,169
- Let's eat. - It looks amazing.

1275
00:44:11,283 --> 00:44:12,496
Let's eat the side dishes.

1276
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:14,653
It looks so good.

1277
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:16,923
(Side dishes prepared with care)

1278
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:20,600
(Bibimbap you can mix with cheonggukjang)

1279
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,908
- Oh, my. - It's here.

1280
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,193
- Oh, my. - Thank you.

1281
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:25,432
Be careful.

1282
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,332
- This is... - That costs only seven dollars?

1283
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,363
That costs only seven dollars?

1284
00:44:28,364 --> 00:44:30,253
- Oh, my. - There is kimchi too.

1285
00:44:30,574 --> 00:44:32,997
- This is great. - And four slices of bossam.

1286
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:36,313
- This is great. - And four slices of bossam.

1287
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,434
This looks so good.

1288
00:44:38,544 --> 00:44:40,199
- I want to eat it. - Put some in...

1289
00:44:40,743 --> 00:44:41,983
- You should mix them together. - Yes.

1290
00:44:41,984 --> 00:44:43,282
- It's barley rice. - Really?

1291
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:45,334
(The whole cheonggukjang set costs only 7 dollars.)

1292
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:46,863
Well...

1293
00:44:47,024 --> 00:44:48,366
How about only one person eats?

1294
00:44:49,094 --> 00:44:50,306
- What? - This one.

1295
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:52,423
- What about 2 people? - 2 people?

1296
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,444
Everyone seems to want some.

1297
00:44:54,564 --> 00:44:57,160
- I want some. - 2 people should eat.

1298
00:44:57,163 --> 00:44:58,662
- Yes. Two people can eat. - Okay.

1299
00:44:58,663 --> 00:44:59,662
What about this?

1300
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,784
- Those who laugh first can't eat. - Okay.

1301
00:45:02,473 --> 00:45:04,595
(The first two people who laugh can't eat.)

1302
00:45:05,174 --> 00:45:07,343
(All the members are good at making others laugh.)

1303
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:08,484
- If you laugh, you lose. - Yes.

1304
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:09,923
- And... - Two people.

1305
00:45:09,944 --> 00:45:11,443
how about only one person can eat?

1306
00:45:11,444 --> 00:45:12,582
(The stakes are raised.)

1307
00:45:12,583 --> 00:45:13,582
(It's getting too serious.)

1308
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,857
- Only 1? - Only 1 person can eat.

1309
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:16,794
That sounds good.

1310
00:45:17,283 --> 00:45:18,952
Gosh, I'm not good at this.

1311
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:20,772
- Me neither. - Ready.

1312
00:45:21,924 --> 00:45:22,952
Start.

1313
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,338
(They start trying to make others laugh.)

1314
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:26,885
(Seok Jin picks up a tissue.)

1315
00:45:27,223 --> 00:45:28,693
(What is he going to do?)

1316
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:30,754
(I'll never laugh.)

1317
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,963
(It doesn't make you want to laugh at all.)

1318
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,852
(What is this?)

1319
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:37,532
(Indifferent)

1320
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:38,702
That's not enough.

1321
00:45:38,703 --> 00:45:39,814
(Calm)

1322
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,939
(Blowing your nose is not enough?)

1323
00:45:44,774 --> 00:45:47,944
(What is she going to do with gochujang?)

1324
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:52,391
(My nose is bleeding.)

1325
00:45:52,884 --> 00:45:55,348
(The 1st warning)

1326
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,852
(This is not enough?)

1327
00:45:57,853 --> 00:45:59,782
(Licking)

1328
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:02,918
(The 2nd warning)

1329
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:05,858
(I almost laughed.)

1330
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:10,602
(Seok Jin picks up some bean sprouts.)

1331
00:46:10,603 --> 00:46:14,340
(He wants to do something with it.)

1332
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:18,645
(A bean sprout attack)

1333
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:22,985
(They try hard to ignore him.)

1334
00:46:24,053 --> 00:46:25,113
Your nose is bleeding.

1335
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:26,770
(Counterattack)

1336
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,665
I know.

1337
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:32,585
(This is an emergency.)

1338
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,722
(Staring)

1339
00:46:34,723 --> 00:46:36,593
(Snorting)

1340
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:38,633
(Seok Jin almost laughed by himself.)

1341
00:46:38,634 --> 00:46:39,633
You just laughed.

1342
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:40,673
(I should get rid of this.)

1343
00:46:42,234 --> 00:46:43,673
You just laughed.

1344
00:46:43,674 --> 00:46:45,173
(He gets rid of the bean sprout.)

1345
00:46:45,174 --> 00:46:46,343
You just laughed.

1346
00:46:46,344 --> 00:46:48,192
(Just then...)

1347
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:53,999
(Kwang Soo eats the bean sprout.)

1348
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:56,397
(Laughing)

1349
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:58,452
I lose.

1350
00:46:58,453 --> 00:47:00,182
(Seok Jin declares his defeat.)

1351
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:01,637
I can't take this one.

1352
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:05,254
(Kwang Soo is a laughter bomber.)

1353
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:07,863
How can you eat that?

1354
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:09,492
(Kwang Soo sacrifices himself to eat cheonggukjang.)

1355
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,817
(I have to hold it back.)

1356
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:14,322
I lose.

1357
00:47:14,634 --> 00:47:16,825
I can't take it anymore.

1358
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:20,001
My goodness. I can't believe it.

1359
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,602
There are two left.

1360
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:26,391
(Only one person can have cheonggukjang.)

1361
00:47:27,183 --> 00:47:30,012
(Kwang Soo goes into action first.)

1362
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:31,753
(What is he going to do?)

1363
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:33,803
Kwang Soo is going to do something.

1364
00:47:34,024 --> 00:47:36,347
I'm so happy I can laugh now.

1365
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:40,492
(Jae Seok is searching for something.)

1366
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:42,513
Here it is. I found it.

1367
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:44,662
(So Min, use this.)

1368
00:47:44,663 --> 00:47:46,403
(This will definitely work.)

1369
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:47,414
Kwang Soo.

1370
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:49,543
Come here.

1371
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:52,898
(Kwang Soo approaches. What is Jae Seok's hidden weapon?)

1372
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,575
Now that I've made it this far...

1373
00:47:55,576 --> 00:47:57,636
- Okay. - I have to win.

1374
00:48:01,606 --> 00:48:03,874
(Kwang Soo approaches. What is Jae Seok's hidden weapon?)

1375
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,775
Now that I've made it this far...

1376
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:07,836
- Okay. - I have to win.

1377
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,634
(Laughing)

1378
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:14,212
(Kwang Soo laughs right away.)

1379
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:16,581
This is Kwang Soo.

1380
00:48:16,582 --> 00:48:18,976
(What made Kwang Soo laugh?)

1381
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:22,486
(A header monster)

1382
00:48:22,821 --> 00:48:25,720
(It makes everyone laugh.)

1383
00:48:25,761 --> 00:48:27,549
I haven't thought about it for a while.

1384
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,307
Put that away.

1385
00:48:29,631 --> 00:48:32,630
(Kwang Soo is heading the ball during the soccer match against...)

1386
00:48:32,631 --> 00:48:34,271
(the Shanghai All Star team in July 2013.)

1387
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:36,231
- For a while... - This is Kwang Soo.

1388
00:48:36,232 --> 00:48:39,232
For a while, all you could get from searching my name was this.

1389
00:48:39,702 --> 00:48:41,240
Why do you even have it?

1390
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:43,110
- He is actually heading the ball. - This picture...

1391
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:44,252
Kwang Soo...

1392
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:48,581
(Kwang Soo tried to head the ball during the soccer match.)

1393
00:48:48,582 --> 00:48:50,720
(The picture became famous when it ended up in the Chinese media.)

1394
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:52,681
- It was a soccer match. - Kwang Soo...

1395
00:48:52,682 --> 00:48:54,540
- was heading the ball. - Doesn't he...

1396
00:48:54,651 --> 00:48:56,621
- really resemble Kwang Soo? - It was in an article.

1397
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:58,510
- It is me. - My goodness.

1398
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:00,791
(It's not just a soccer player that looks like me.)

1399
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:01,974
It's really me.

1400
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:04,453
It's not a soccer player that looks like me.

1401
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:07,794
The ball flew at him,

1402
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:09,719
and he tried to head.

1403
00:49:09,932 --> 00:49:12,466
- The final winner is... - It's So Min.

1404
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,830
- I didn't know it'd be me. - So Min.

1405
00:49:15,272 --> 00:49:16,282
Do you want me to mix it for you?

1406
00:49:16,441 --> 00:49:17,911
Yes, please. Thank you.

1407
00:49:17,912 --> 00:49:19,800
- You can have a spoonful. - Okay.

1408
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:21,568
- Please make it tasty. - Okay.

1409
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:23,081
It looks so tasty.

1410
00:49:23,082 --> 00:49:25,280
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.

1411
00:49:25,281 --> 00:49:27,544
(The warm cheonggukjang is mixed with barley rice and vegetables.)

1412
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:30,288
It makes a certain sound when you mix it.

1413
00:49:30,562 --> 00:49:32,238
- It looks so tasty. - Thank you.

1414
00:49:32,821 --> 00:49:33,931
- This is... - Oh, my.

1415
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:37,294
- Gosh. - It's been a long time.

1416
00:49:38,031 --> 00:49:40,697
This is a lot of food.

1417
00:49:41,471 --> 00:49:43,400
(Jae Seok gets to try a ladleful.)

1418
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:45,259
(This is it.)

1419
00:49:46,772 --> 00:49:49,070
- It's crazy. - It was a good game.

1420
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,181
I know many games like this.

1421
00:49:50,182 --> 00:49:51,481
(It's driving me crazy.)

1422
00:49:51,482 --> 00:49:52,481
You can try some.

1423
00:49:52,482 --> 00:49:55,512
If you give up your Penalty Exemption Card, I'll let you try.

1424
00:49:56,412 --> 00:50:01,751
(A Penalty Exemption Card for a spoonful of cheonggukjang?)

1425
00:50:01,752 --> 00:50:02,832
That's appealing.

1426
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,561
That's an appealing offer.

1427
00:50:04,562 --> 00:50:06,831
- It's a good deal. - It's appealing.

1428
00:50:06,832 --> 00:50:08,710
A slice of bossam and the rest of this.

1429
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:11,123
- Even a slice of bossam? - That's definitely appealing.

1430
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:14,099
- In any case... - There's a lot left.

1431
00:50:14,131 --> 00:50:16,201
- It tastes amazing. - It's at least a ladleful.

1432
00:50:16,202 --> 00:50:17,756
(Inner conflict)

1433
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:22,141
(A Penalty Exemption Card or a half bowl of bibimbap?)

1434
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:24,880
(All I've eaten since the race started is...)

1435
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:28,411
(a bit of fermented skate ramyeon.)

1436
00:50:28,412 --> 00:50:29,493
I'll eat.

1437
00:50:30,622 --> 00:50:33,351
(Put your spoon down.)

1438
00:50:33,352 --> 00:50:34,704
I give up my card.

1439
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:37,417
I give up my Penalty Exemption Card.

1440
00:50:37,962 --> 00:50:40,043
This is why I love this team.

1441
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,172
I can't help.

1442
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:42,806
(It's all yours.)

1443
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:45,661
- This is why I love this team. - I can't help.

1444
00:50:45,662 --> 00:50:47,970
(He exchanged his Penalty Exemption Card for cheonggukjang.)

1445
00:50:47,971 --> 00:50:49,415
- It looks so tasty. - Thank you.

1446
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,884
- Gosh. - This is...

1447
00:50:51,372 --> 00:50:52,382
It tastes so good.

1448
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:54,070
It's crazy, right?

1449
00:50:54,071 --> 00:50:55,740
- It tastes good, right? - It's crazy, right?

1450
00:50:55,741 --> 00:50:57,010
- Eat this too. - It tastes so good.

1451
00:50:57,011 --> 00:50:58,729
Eat this and bossam too.

1452
00:50:59,982 --> 00:51:02,103
- I told you it'd be tasty. - Wait.

1453
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:03,681
Where did everything go? It's all gone.

1454
00:51:03,682 --> 00:51:05,943
- Where did it go? - It must be delicious.

1455
00:51:06,252 --> 00:51:08,891
- It tastes so good. Bossam too. - Right.

1456
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:11,760
- The mission is about food, - It's not enough.

1457
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:12,820
but why are we still hungry?

1458
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,231
(Why are we still hungry?)

1459
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:15,231
(Their stomachs are still empty.)

1460
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:16,360
I'm hungry too.

1461
00:51:16,361 --> 00:51:19,766
That's strange. The mission is about food, but I still feel hungry.

1462
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:22,053
- I'm hungry too. - That's strange.

1463
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,363
Guys, the other team...

1464
00:51:24,502 --> 00:51:26,601
has finished their jokbal.

1465
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:28,311
One of your wires will be cut.

1466
00:51:28,312 --> 00:51:29,811
- Okay. - Which color?

1467
00:51:29,812 --> 00:51:30,840
- Do it. - Which color?

1468
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:32,861
But...

1469
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,901
- There is something else? - There is something else?

1470
00:51:36,011 --> 00:51:37,435
It's for Jae Seok.

1471
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:41,021
Glasses and nose hair will be drawn on your face.

1472
00:51:41,022 --> 00:51:42,521
(Draw glasses and nose hair on Jae Seok's face.)

1473
00:51:42,522 --> 00:51:44,339
- That's... - Glasses and nose hair...

1474
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:50,030
(Team Jae Seok ordered Haha's hat to be removed.)

1475
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:52,400
(Haha pays them back with something stronger.)

1476
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:53,771
- Let me do it. - Let me do it.

1477
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:55,993
- You're good at it. - I want to do it too.

1478
00:51:56,102 --> 00:51:57,101
(Why did I start this?)

1479
00:51:57,102 --> 00:51:58,890
- You draw glasses, I'll draw hair. - Okay.

1480
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:02,670
(Kwang Soo and So Min become enthusiastic...)

1481
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:06,145
(and put a lot of care into the details.)

1482
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,181
(Jae Seok's appearance is upgraded.)

1483
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:10,938
You're wearing two pairs of glasses.

1484
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:13,481
Get the bomb ready.

1485
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:14,650
Which color?

1486
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:18,297
(Team Jong Kook attacks Team Jae Seok.)

1487
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:20,512
- We'll give them black too. - They gave us black.

1488
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:22,561
- Black. - Black.

1489
00:52:22,562 --> 00:52:25,661
(An eye for an eye. They choose black wire.)

1490
00:52:25,662 --> 00:52:28,732
(Team Jong Kook attacks Team Jae Seok's black wire.)

1491
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:32,925
- Black for black? - I think black...

1492
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,010
- I don't think it's black. - It's not black.

1493
00:52:35,011 --> 00:52:36,740
- No. - It's not black.

1494
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:38,510
- I agree. - It can't be black.

1495
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:40,280
- Let me cut it. - I think...

1496
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:41,464
You can cut it.

1497
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,081
Black.

1498
00:52:44,082 --> 00:52:45,798
(Trembling)

1499
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:47,436
Here we go.

1500
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:49,503
Do you want to do it, So Min?

1501
00:52:49,991 --> 00:52:51,190
1, 2...

1502
00:52:51,191 --> 00:52:53,383
(The black wire is cut.)

1503
00:52:53,761 --> 00:52:58,579
(If the bomb goes off, they lose and the race is over.)

1504
00:52:58,662 --> 00:53:01,070
(What will happen to Team Jae Seok?)

1505
00:53:01,071 --> 00:53:02,831
(They survive.)

1506
00:53:02,832 --> 00:53:03,982
- It wasn't black. - Two...

1507
00:53:04,241 --> 00:53:06,041
(Team Jong Kook's attack fails.)

1508
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,541
- It wasn't black. - Gosh.

1509
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:08,552
What a relief.

1510
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:10,170
What a relief. With your Penalty Exemption Card gone...

1511
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,780
- I can't do this... - This is too intense.

1512
00:53:12,781 --> 00:53:16,216
(Team Jong Kook's black and Team Jae Seok's white and black are out.)

1513
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:19,008
- Guys, did you enjoy the food? - Yes.

1514
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,705
- It was delicious. - It was.

1515
00:53:20,752 --> 00:53:22,136
We have chance cards.

1516
00:53:22,392 --> 00:53:24,391
- There are four types. - Okay.

1517
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:25,806
- What are they? - I see.

1518
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:29,490
There are a Discount Card, a Lowest Price Card,

1519
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:32,128
a Changing Dish Card, and a Rip-off Card.

1520
00:53:32,162 --> 00:53:33,900
Discount, Lowest Price, and Changing Dish Cards...

1521
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:35,791
are used for defense.

1522
00:53:35,901 --> 00:53:37,053
We want to attack.

1523
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:39,070
- Then you can use a Rip-off Card. - What's that?

1524
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:40,811
You'll carry out a mission.

1525
00:53:40,812 --> 00:53:43,110
Depending on the number of your successes,

1526
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:45,102
the price for the other team will be lowered.

1527
00:53:46,142 --> 00:53:48,030
- By how much? - They need a five-dollar dish?

1528
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:49,780
Will you use a chance card?

1529
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:51,121
- Yes. - A Rip-off Card?

1530
00:53:51,122 --> 00:53:52,621
- Yes. - Of course.

1531
00:53:52,622 --> 00:53:54,369
- Here are some rubber bands. - What's that?

1532
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:57,990
Put a rubber band around your head.

1533
00:53:57,991 --> 00:53:59,561
Using your facial muscles,

1534
00:53:59,562 --> 00:54:01,961
- push it down to your neck. - What?

1535
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,130
- Push it down? - What?

1536
00:54:03,131 --> 00:54:04,630
- How? - How?

1537
00:54:04,631 --> 00:54:05,800
Like this.

1538
00:54:05,801 --> 00:54:07,014
Push it down to your neck.

1539
00:54:07,071 --> 00:54:08,501
- Like this. - Okay.

1540
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,601
Push it down.

1541
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:11,570
- There you go. - Like this?

1542
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:14,641
(Order: Jae Seok, Seok Jin, So Min, Kwang Soo)

1543
00:54:16,372 --> 00:54:18,240
It has to be lower in the back.

1544
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:19,424
Okay.

1545
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:22,650
(He suddenly looks decades older.)

1546
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:24,981
- Hold on. - Jae Seok.

1547
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:26,420
(What happened?)

1548
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:28,820
What happened to his face?

1549
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:30,913
- Don't you want to succeed? - I do.

1550
00:54:31,022 --> 00:54:33,759
- Ready. - We're sacrificing ourselves...

1551
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:35,090
to rip the other team off.

1552
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:37,731
Ready, start.

1553
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:38,771
(He is given 30 seconds.)

1554
00:54:39,462 --> 00:54:41,800
(Wriggling)

1555
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:43,185
- Oh, my. - It's going down.

1556
00:54:43,232 --> 00:54:45,666
It's stuck at his mouth. His mouth sticks out too much.

1557
00:54:46,602 --> 00:54:48,911
(The rubber band is stuck at his mouth.)

1558
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,010
- It's impossible. - Be quiet.

1559
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:51,325
- It's not going to work. - It's like Mount Baekdu.

1560
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:53,431
It's impossible. His mouth sticks out too much.

1561
00:54:53,611 --> 00:54:56,511
- That's the Himalayas. - It's too high.

1562
00:54:56,852 --> 00:55:00,527
(It'd be challenging even for experienced climbers.)

1563
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:02,839
- It's on the peak now. - It's going down.

1564
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,339
- It's going down. - It's on the peak.

1565
00:55:05,591 --> 00:55:06,773
- It's going down. - Gosh.

1566
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:09,913
(It's at his lower lip now.)

1567
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:13,030
- It's stuck at his lower lip now. - It's stuck.

1568
00:55:13,031 --> 00:55:14,041
It's one thing after another.

1569
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:16,288
It gets worse and worse.

1570
00:55:16,301 --> 00:55:17,856
- Use your tongue. - There you go.

1571
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:19,771
- It gets worse and worse. - Use your tongue.

1572
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:21,488
- Use your tongue. - Right.

1573
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:24,380
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

1574
00:55:24,381 --> 00:55:25,510
- It's down. - Yes!

1575
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:26,622
Okay.

1576
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:28,110
(Jae Seok barely succeeds.)

1577
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,451
- Okay! - We cleared the mission!

1578
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:31,472
Okay! Did you see that?

1579
00:55:31,522 --> 00:55:33,269
- You were awesome. - Did you see that?

1580
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:34,621
Wow, Jae Seok.

1581
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,490
- Did we get 50 cents? - Yes.

1582
00:55:36,491 --> 00:55:37,820
That was quick.

1583
00:55:37,821 --> 00:55:40,021
- The next one is 6.50 dollars. - Okay.

1584
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:41,260
- Okay, okay. - Okay.

1585
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:43,490
I can't believe your mouth protrudes more than your nose does.

1586
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:44,800
(Amazed)

1587
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,701
(His lips looked like Mt. Everest.)

1588
00:55:46,702 --> 00:55:49,126
Hey, be quiet, will you?

1589
00:55:49,301 --> 00:55:50,988
- All right, Seok Jin. - Is it my turn?

1590
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:54,340
- Done. - Ready.

1591
00:55:54,341 --> 00:55:55,940
(After putting on the rubber band, he wears his glasses.)

1592
00:55:55,941 --> 00:55:58,437
- He's still wearing his glasses. - Be careful.

1593
00:55:58,482 --> 00:55:59,956
Set. Go.

1594
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:02,064
You look cute.

1595
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:04,380
(He's a 54-year-old cutie.)

1596
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,681
- You're cute. - Oh, come on.

1597
00:56:05,682 --> 00:56:07,268
- Don't try to look cute. - I'm not.

1598
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,061
- Your nose is too high. - It's not coming down.

1599
00:56:11,062 --> 00:56:12,690
(His nose is his problem.)

1600
00:56:12,691 --> 00:56:14,231
The rubber band is digging into his face.

1601
00:56:14,232 --> 00:56:17,061
- Why can't you do it? - His nose is too high.

1602
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:18,345
(The rubber band is stuck to his face.)

1603
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,231
Why can't you do it?

1604
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:21,383
(Frustrated)

1605
00:56:21,801 --> 00:56:23,271
- Come on. - It's not moving at all.

1606
00:56:23,272 --> 00:56:25,900
He needs to move much more.

1607
00:56:25,901 --> 00:56:27,371
(He tries his best.)

1608
00:56:27,372 --> 00:56:29,440
Try harder. Try harder.

1609
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:30,610
(He does everything he can.)

1610
00:56:30,611 --> 00:56:33,641
- Please. - Please, Seok Jin.

1611
00:56:33,642 --> 00:56:34,780
Time's over.

1612
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:36,510
(He fails to move it even 1cm lower.)

1613
00:56:36,511 --> 00:56:38,380
- You couldn't do it. - It just wouldn't budge.

1614
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:41,451
To think that you want to receive the Penalty Exemption Card...

1615
00:56:41,452 --> 00:56:43,441
It doesn't work. Try it.

1616
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,090
- Try it. - I'll do it.

1617
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,212
- Go, So Min. - My nose and mouth aren't high.

1618
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,860
Ready, set,

1619
00:56:49,861 --> 00:56:50,871
- Go. - go.

1620
00:56:52,361 --> 00:56:54,630
(Stretching)

1621
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:56,701
- You're doing good. - It went completely down.

1622
00:56:56,702 --> 00:56:58,701
- How did you do that? - How did you?

1623
00:56:58,702 --> 00:56:59,701
(It's unbelievable.)

1624
00:56:59,702 --> 00:57:00,811
- Are you okay? - How did she do that?

1625
00:57:00,812 --> 00:57:02,811
- How is it possible? - Look at her.

1626
00:57:02,812 --> 00:57:04,801
(Would you like to look at my face again?)

1627
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:09,351
(It was a collaboration between her nose and facial muscles.)

1628
00:57:09,352 --> 00:57:10,550
- Good job. - It's going down.

1629
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:12,451
(They realize her true talent.)

1630
00:57:12,452 --> 00:57:14,621
- You're good. - How do you do it?

1631
00:57:14,622 --> 00:57:16,541
She's so fast.

1632
00:57:16,622 --> 00:57:18,521
- How did she do that? - Move backwards.

1633
00:57:18,522 --> 00:57:20,590
- Your chin's in the way. - My chin protrudes.

1634
00:57:20,591 --> 00:57:23,288
(She's stuck.)

1635
00:57:23,332 --> 00:57:24,860
- Your chin's in the way. - My chin protrudes.

1636
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:27,699
Don't talk! We don't need to hear that.

1637
00:57:28,171 --> 00:57:30,771
- Don't talk about your chin. - Why did you?

1638
00:57:30,772 --> 00:57:32,300
- Move it backwards? - Everyone including me has...

1639
00:57:32,301 --> 00:57:35,170
- secrets regarding their bodies. - Her chin is the problem.

1640
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:37,010
- You can do it. - She's in trouble.

1641
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:38,780
- You're almost there. - You're almost there.

1642
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:40,510
(She only has 10 seconds left.)

1643
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:42,481
- You're almost there. - Her chin is the problem.

1644
00:57:42,482 --> 00:57:43,492
Please!

1645
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,220
- Please, So Min. - You did it!

1646
00:57:45,221 --> 00:57:46,220
Good job.

1647
00:57:46,221 --> 00:57:47,650
(So Min barely makes it.)

1648
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:49,550
- Mission complete. - She's good.

1649
00:57:49,551 --> 00:57:51,138
I seem to be the problem.

1650
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:53,391
Protruding mouth, protruding nose, and protruding chin.

1651
00:57:53,392 --> 00:57:55,079
- It was stuck at my nose. - You had trouble with your chin.

1652
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:56,676
This part is high.

1653
00:57:56,732 --> 00:57:59,030
I bet he'll get stuck on his lips because they're thick.

1654
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:00,618
- His lips? - Kwang Soo.

1655
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:02,519
We should get a total of 1.50 dollars off, right?

1656
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:06,840
(I'll show you.)

1657
00:58:06,841 --> 00:58:07,871
Look at him.

1658
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:12,023
(He has a fascinating face.)

1659
00:58:13,511 --> 00:58:14,851
(Everyone is bewitched.)

1660
00:58:14,852 --> 00:58:16,063
You look ugly.

1661
00:58:16,212 --> 00:58:18,040
- You really do. - Is your nose boneless?

1662
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:20,920
- Of course, I do. - You're lacking bones there.

1663
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:22,150
(His nose is only made up of flesh.)

1664
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:23,820
- You're boneless. - What do you mean?

1665
00:58:23,821 --> 00:58:25,161
- Goodness. - Where are your bones?

1666
00:58:25,162 --> 00:58:27,530
You look like a Roman soldier with a helmet on.

1667
00:58:27,531 --> 00:58:28,860
- You're right. - Right?

1668
00:58:28,861 --> 00:58:31,185
His nose is boneless.

1669
00:58:31,332 --> 00:58:33,300
- You don't have any bones. - Hey,

1670
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:34,831
your nose collapsed.

1671
00:58:34,832 --> 00:58:37,101
- This type of nose could help me. - You're right.

1672
00:58:37,102 --> 00:58:39,340
Ready, set, go.

1673
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:40,400
(He has 30 seconds.)

1674
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:42,110
- That was fast. - He did it.

1675
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:43,670
(His boneless nose does indeed help him.)

1676
00:58:43,671 --> 00:58:45,411
- That didn't take long. - He gets stuck on his lips.

1677
00:58:45,412 --> 00:58:46,725
- He has thick lips. - You're right.

1678
00:58:48,412 --> 00:58:51,310
- You're so ugly. - He's mutated.

1679
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:54,852
- He's a mutant. - He looks like that fish.

1680
00:58:55,392 --> 00:58:58,121
He looks like a pollack.

1681
00:58:58,122 --> 00:58:59,132
A pollack?

1682
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:03,331
(Human pollack: Appears during the rubber band game)

1683
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,061
(They have found a rare species.)

1684
00:59:05,062 --> 00:59:07,130
- Or was it a rockfish? - A rockfish?

1685
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:08,130
- A rockfish? - A rockfish?

1686
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,800
(His face is about to collapse.)

1687
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,094
- It's working. - You have to do this.

1688
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:13,919
- This is the hard part. - Okay.

1689
00:59:14,071 --> 00:59:17,202
A bit more, Kwang Soo.

1690
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:22,692
(We cannot dare to describe this face.)

1691
00:59:24,221 --> 00:59:28,867
(He is our country's number 1 humorous cultural asset.)

1692
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:31,161
You have to do it, Kwang Soo. Come on.

1693
00:59:31,162 --> 00:59:33,090
- Your chin is in the way. - Kwang Soo, please.

1694
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:35,061
- You're right. - Hurry.

1695
00:59:35,062 --> 00:59:36,090
We're running out of time.

1696
00:59:36,091 --> 00:59:38,231
- Hurry. Hey, hey. - I think it'll work.

1697
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:39,760
- Please. - Come on.

1698
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:42,700
(The cultural asset is malfunctioning.)

1699
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:45,240
- The chin is getting in the way. - Please!

1700
00:59:45,241 --> 00:59:46,787
Kwang Soo, please.

1701
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:48,871
He'll succeed if he gets the rubber band down.

1702
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:50,760
- He won't succeed. - You just need to look up.

1703
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:52,694
- Kwang Soo. - One...

1704
00:59:52,812 --> 00:59:54,367
(He fails.)

1705
00:59:54,611 --> 00:59:55,650
- One... - Yes?

1706
00:59:55,651 --> 00:59:57,311
(He only replies well.)

1707
00:59:57,312 --> 00:59:59,021
- Time's up. - He failed.

1708
00:59:59,022 --> 01:00:00,365
Does your chin protrude that much?

1709
01:00:00,622 --> 01:00:03,217
- Why is it so difficult? - It's completely stuck there.

1710
01:00:03,522 --> 01:00:07,097
All right. Two of you succeeded.

1711
01:00:07,261 --> 01:00:09,231
That team will have a limit of six dollars.

1712
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:10,391
It'll be below six dollars.

1713
01:00:10,392 --> 01:00:11,916
(Team Jong Kook will have to go with six dollars or less.)

1714
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:14,895
It's time for you to choose your next menu.

1715
01:00:14,971 --> 01:00:17,769
Team Jae Seok has given you a six-dollar limit.

1716
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:21,041
- Really? - We need to pick well.

1717
01:00:21,042 --> 01:00:23,311
Shouldn't we pick 1 or 2?

1718
01:00:23,312 --> 01:00:26,139
I don't think we should leave them be.

1719
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:27,823
I wonder what the 1st one is.

1720
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,451
- Beondegi. - Maybe.

1721
01:00:30,452 --> 01:00:33,481
It could be beondegi, raw octopus, or chicken feet.

1722
01:00:33,482 --> 01:00:35,339
- Chicken feet? - Yes. Those are my guesses.

1723
01:00:35,392 --> 01:00:37,391
- Let's just open it. - Let's open the first one.

1724
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:39,590
Yes, let's do that.

1725
01:00:39,591 --> 01:00:41,783
As long as I'm with you guys, I'm not afraid.

1726
01:00:41,962 --> 01:00:44,729
How about we fold our hands together...

1727
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:46,931
- before opening this? - I'm down.

1728
01:00:46,932 --> 01:00:48,601
(He wants to fold hands together.)

1729
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:49,601
(You little...)

1730
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,771
- Jong Kook. - Like this.

1731
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,900
- Let's do this together. - Let's do it.

1732
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:53,641
If I do it, I won't be able to open this.

1733
01:00:53,642 --> 01:00:54,681
I'll open it with my mouth.

1734
01:00:55,412 --> 01:00:56,411
(Sighing)

1735
01:00:56,412 --> 01:00:57,422
- All right. - Jong Kook.

1736
01:00:58,841 --> 01:01:00,872
- Okay. - Okay. With your mouth.

1737
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:03,877
(They fold hands together.)

1738
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:07,520
Haha wanted to do it badly. This is what he does.

1739
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,690
- Open it with your mouth. - Do it.

1740
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:10,690
(He suppresses his anger.)

1741
01:01:10,691 --> 01:01:11,975
- Open it. - Open it.

1742
01:01:12,522 --> 01:01:14,860
- He's really doing it. - I know.

1743
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:16,590
He is. All this just for folding hands?

1744
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:18,601
- Is this necessary? - Yes.

1745
01:01:18,602 --> 01:01:19,860
Why?

1746
01:01:19,861 --> 01:01:22,397
Use your front teeth. Good.

1747
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:24,740
It's almost done.

1748
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:28,205
(What is the menu that they chose this time?)

1749
01:01:29,412 --> 01:01:31,681
- It's raw octopus! - It's raw octopus.

1750
01:01:31,682 --> 01:01:32,692
Raw octopus.

1751
01:01:33,142 --> 01:01:37,050
(This delicacy allows you to feel the texture of the live octopus.)

1752
01:01:37,412 --> 01:01:40,420
(It may seem extremely unusual to foreigners, )

1753
01:01:40,421 --> 01:01:43,826
(but once you have a taste, there's no going back.)

1754
01:01:44,392 --> 01:01:45,561
Isn't raw octopus expensive?

1755
01:01:45,562 --> 01:01:47,037
- Yes. - It's expensive.

1756
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,760
It's very expensive.

1757
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:50,954
- It is. - Let me look it up.

1758
01:01:51,131 --> 01:01:53,282
They wouldn't sell it for this price even at the Noryangjin Fish Market.

1759
01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:56,400
But we just need 1 portion. We just need 1 octopus.

1760
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:58,926
- One octopus? - Raw octopus is expensive,

1761
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:02,139
but dead octopus is cheap.

1762
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:05,067
- Because... - Can't we perform CPR?

1763
01:02:05,111 --> 01:02:07,711
- It's expensive when it's alive. - We can try pumping its heart.

1764
01:02:07,712 --> 01:02:08,751
We can perform CPR.

1765
01:02:08,752 --> 01:02:10,510
What if we pay our raw money for it?

1766
01:02:10,511 --> 01:02:12,320
(He tries to talk smart.)

1767
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:13,320
What?

1768
01:02:13,321 --> 01:02:14,320
(It makes him look old.)

1769
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:16,008
- What should we do? - Let's see.

1770
01:02:16,252 --> 01:02:17,676
There aren't any.

1771
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:20,214
Do we get no chances?

1772
01:02:20,832 --> 01:02:22,881
- So... - All right.

1773
01:02:22,962 --> 01:02:25,760
We have several chance cards that'll reduce the price.

1774
01:02:25,761 --> 01:02:27,075
There's always a way out.

1775
01:02:27,332 --> 01:02:29,771
- Choose one. - There are Discount Card,

1776
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:33,041
- Rip-off Card, Changing Dish Card. - Changing Dish Card.

1777
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,670
The Lowest Price Card is the best.

1778
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,670
- We need to get this one. - All right.

1779
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:38,681
This is our only way to win.

1780
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:40,880
If we pick the other cards, they'll only counterattack.

1781
01:02:40,881 --> 01:02:43,478
Getting something below seven dollars seems impossible.

1782
01:02:43,482 --> 01:02:45,420
- Should we do that? - Let's do it.

1783
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,521
- We choose this card. - All right.

1784
01:02:46,522 --> 01:02:48,370
You chose the Lowest Price Card.

1785
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:50,220
Once you pass the mission,

1786
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:52,080
- you will obtain the card. - Okay.

1787
01:02:52,321 --> 01:02:55,891
The mission is called Hello, My Friend.

1788
01:02:55,892 --> 01:02:57,780
(Hello, My Friend)

1789
01:02:58,232 --> 01:02:59,444
- Hello, My Friend? - Yes.

1790
01:02:59,562 --> 01:03:01,086
You need to call a friend of yours.

1791
01:03:01,202 --> 01:03:04,303
Visit that friend, and do a mission together.

1792
01:03:04,642 --> 01:03:05,853
If you succeed,

1793
01:03:06,002 --> 01:03:08,411
you're price will be regarded as a lower price...

1794
01:03:08,412 --> 01:03:10,331
- than your opponent's. - That's amazing.

1795
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:12,763
Can we call whomever we want?

1796
01:03:12,781 --> 01:03:14,731
- Yes. - Do you know anyone around here?

1797
01:03:15,051 --> 01:03:17,311
I can try calling since it's Monday.

1798
01:03:17,312 --> 01:03:19,420
- Let's see. Jae Seong... - Hold on.

1799
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,021
I wonder what Sang Yeob is doing.

1800
01:03:21,022 --> 01:03:22,621
- Oh, right. - He lives in Seorae Village.

1801
01:03:22,622 --> 01:03:24,843
He's done filming his drama.

1802
01:03:25,022 --> 01:03:26,940
Sang Yeob usually says yes.

1803
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:28,990
He waits for such calls.

1804
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:32,400
(They try calling him.)

1805
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,731
We used to call him on Tuesdays, so he might not be ready today.

1806
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:37,317
(No way)

1807
01:03:37,425 --> 01:03:41,667
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E439 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1808
01:03:41,772 --> 01:03:44,438
I think he's made up his mind to pursue only acting.

1809
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:46,010
(Maybe it's because you called.)

1810
01:03:46,011 --> 01:03:47,627
- That's possible. - He's determined.

1811
01:03:48,151 --> 01:03:51,312
How about Hong Jin Young?

1812
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:54,048
Do you have her number? You should call her then.

1813
01:03:54,082 --> 01:03:55,939
Should I try calling her?

1814
01:03:56,691 --> 01:04:03,431
(He decides to call Jin Young.)

1815
01:04:03,432 --> 01:04:05,784
- Hello, Se Chan. - Hey, where are you?

1816
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:07,900
I'm filming at the moment.

1817
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:10,629
- Oh, are you? - Team Switzerland!

1818
01:04:10,971 --> 01:04:13,240
Team Switzerland is here.

1819
01:04:13,241 --> 01:04:14,510
Where?

1820
01:04:14,511 --> 01:04:16,896
We're at a jokbal restaurant.

1821
01:04:17,142 --> 01:04:18,797
- Really? - Yes.

1822
01:04:19,212 --> 01:04:22,584
No way, no way. In broad daylight?

1823
01:04:22,881 --> 01:04:25,050
We're also filming right now.

1824
01:04:25,051 --> 01:04:26,820
(She thought they were drinking.)

1825
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,920
(Don't misunderstand us.)

1826
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:30,791
- Goodness. - Jin Young.

1827
01:04:30,792 --> 01:04:32,681
Watch what you say.

1828
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:34,849
You made it sound like we were drinking.

1829
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:37,161
- I see. - We're doing a mission right now.

1830
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:38,530
If you were around Gangnam,

1831
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:39,744
- we were about to come see you. - Right.

1832
01:04:39,932 --> 01:04:41,114
I am.

1833
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:43,649
- Really? - Where?

1834
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:46,570
Hey, if we went there right now,

1835
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:49,711
will you be able to make time for us for about 10 to 15 minutes?

1836
01:04:49,712 --> 01:04:51,510
(He asks if they can stop by.)

1837
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,127
- Sure, come. - Seriously?

1838
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:54,380
(Surprised)

1839
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:56,331
- What is she filming? - What are you filming?

1840
01:04:56,381 --> 01:04:58,845
- What is it? - Are you filming yourself?

1841
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:00,796
I'm shooting a commercial.

1842
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:02,820
- A commercial? - We'll be there.

1843
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:04,420
- A commercial? - I see.

1844
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:07,190
You better hurry. I'll be waiting.

1845
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:08,808
All right. We'll be there in a second.

1846
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:10,850
- Okay, bye. - Bye.

1847
01:05:11,062 --> 01:05:12,142
Bye.

1848
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:14,371
- She's so laidback. - We did it.

1849
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:15,771
- She said yes. - We did it.

1850
01:05:15,772 --> 01:05:18,101
- And she's nearby as well. - She's in Gangnam...

1851
01:05:18,102 --> 01:05:19,871
and has full makeup on.

1852
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,427
It's our fate.

1853
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:23,288
- Okay. - Let's go.

1854
01:05:23,912 --> 01:05:26,104
- We did it. That was smooth. - That was.

1855
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,550
(They're about to go meet her.)

1856
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:31,399
- Let's go. - Hold on.

1857
01:05:32,151 --> 01:05:34,716
Team Jae Seok has attacked you.

1858
01:05:35,752 --> 01:05:36,863
This is the last one.

1859
01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:38,703
All right.

1860
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:40,912
Which one of theirs will you cut?

1861
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,207
This time, it might work.

1862
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:46,023
- Let's send it off. - I think we should.

1863
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:47,888
Which colors are left.

1864
01:05:48,131 --> 01:05:50,526
I'll listen to you guys.

1865
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:51,940
- Whatever you say. - How about the blue one?

1866
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:53,860
- Sure. - The blue one?

1867
01:05:53,901 --> 01:05:54,911
1, 2, 3.

1868
01:05:54,912 --> 01:05:56,010
- Blue. - Blue.

1869
01:05:56,011 --> 01:05:57,526
(They choose blue.)

1870
01:05:57,781 --> 01:05:59,641
(Team Jong Kook needs to cut the blue wire.)

1871
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:01,329
Please cut the blue wire.

1872
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:02,791
The blue one?

1873
01:06:03,482 --> 01:06:04,481
Hold on.

1874
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:05,650
(It can't explode.)

1875
01:06:05,651 --> 01:06:06,692
Hold on.

1876
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:08,466
- I'll cut it now. - No!

1877
01:06:09,392 --> 01:06:10,431
One...

1878
01:06:11,062 --> 01:06:12,820
(Did Team Jae Seok pick...)

1879
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:13,831
Two...

1880
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:15,260
(the right wire to explode it?)

1881
01:06:15,261 --> 01:06:16,331
Three.

1882
01:06:16,332 --> 01:06:18,431
(Did Team Jae Seok pick the right wire to explode it?)

1883
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,130
(Se Chan has cut...)

1884
01:06:20,131 --> 01:06:22,394
(the blue wire.)

1885
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:24,231
(Cutting)

1886
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:26,240
(It's silent.)

1887
01:06:26,241 --> 01:06:28,070
(The bomb did not go off. Team Jae Seok has failed.)

1888
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,811
We're safe.

1889
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:30,940
(Everyone was anxious.)

1890
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:32,610
- That scared. - Okay.

1891
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:35,050
(They succeed in defending themselves.)

1892
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,351
(They can only counterattack once they obtain the chance card.)

1893
01:06:37,352 --> 01:06:38,391
Let's go.

1894
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,150
Stop.

1895
01:06:40,151 --> 01:06:41,251
(They need to succeed the mission with Jin Young.)

1896
01:06:41,252 --> 01:06:43,646
I'm so thankful that she could meet us.

1897
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:46,391
- Let's go. - I bet she'll scream.

1898
01:06:46,392 --> 01:06:48,685
- I bet she will. - Jin Young!

1899
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:52,023
Don't pretend to be working when you're already done.

1900
01:06:52,432 --> 01:06:54,331
(She was monitoring.)

1901
01:06:54,332 --> 01:06:56,149
(He starts nagging the moment he enters.)

1902
01:06:56,732 --> 01:06:58,771
- I wasn't. - Don't pretend to be monitoring.

1903
01:06:58,772 --> 01:06:59,771
I wasn't.

1904
01:06:59,772 --> 01:07:01,893
I thought she was shooting "New Late Night E News".

1905
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:04,021
Hello.

1906
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:05,392
Jin Young.

1907
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:09,251
(Jin Young joined the group on a trip to Switzerland.)

1908
01:07:09,252 --> 01:07:10,681
(It was a family special.)

1909
01:07:10,682 --> 01:07:15,135
(She was like Ji Hyo's sister and Jong Kook's girlfriend.)

1910
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:16,920
We're really thankful.

1911
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:18,360
- We are. - It's all right.

1912
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:19,791
- We had to find someone, - Right.

1913
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,030
- but it was difficult to find one. - Really?

1914
01:07:22,031 --> 01:07:23,860
But celebrities don't want to appear on TV all of a sudden...

1915
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:25,501
- in no makeup. - Right.

1916
01:07:25,502 --> 01:07:27,130
- But you saved us. - I'm always prepared.

1917
01:07:27,131 --> 01:07:28,470
- Exactly. - I'm always prepared.

1918
01:07:28,471 --> 01:07:29,785
- I'm the best - You're the best

1919
01:07:30,272 --> 01:07:31,888
She was holding that all along.

1920
01:07:31,941 --> 01:07:33,141
(She's indeed always ready.)

1921
01:07:33,142 --> 01:07:34,657
She's the best

1922
01:07:35,312 --> 01:07:38,081
(They thank her for her willingness.)

1923
01:07:38,082 --> 01:07:39,510
She's amazing.

1924
01:07:39,511 --> 01:07:41,681
- She really is. - Thank goodness we came.

1925
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:42,880
- I know. - Right.

1926
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:43,922
All right.

1927
01:07:44,082 --> 01:07:45,751
In order for the team to obtain the Lowest Price Card,

1928
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:47,438
Jin Young needs to go through a mission...

1929
01:07:47,622 --> 01:07:49,391
called A Solemn Snack.

1930
01:07:49,392 --> 01:07:51,090
(A Solemn Snack)

1931
01:07:51,091 --> 01:07:53,082
- What is that? - Does she need to eat something?

1932
01:07:53,221 --> 01:07:54,706
Do I need to eat solemnly?

1933
01:07:54,932 --> 01:07:56,190
We'll lose then.

1934
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:58,383
(What is her mission?)

1935
01:07:58,832 --> 01:08:00,276
In 60 seconds,

1936
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,290
you need to eat four or more snacks...

1937
01:08:02,332 --> 01:08:04,841
that dangle from a crown.

1938
01:08:04,842 --> 01:08:07,140
- A crown? - You know how we play that game...

1939
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:08,556
with dried persimmons?

1940
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:10,991
- She'll do well. - That's difficult.

1941
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:12,959
Where did you get that crown?

1942
01:08:13,082 --> 01:08:14,626
Doesn't this spin?

1943
01:08:14,752 --> 01:08:16,398
- It's hard. - Will you be able to do it?

1944
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:18,251
- Will you? - Does it spin faster?

1945
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:19,650
Look at you two.

1946
01:08:19,651 --> 01:08:22,421
(Haha points to Ji Hyo and Jin Young.)

1947
01:08:22,422 --> 01:08:24,512
- They're best friends. - I know.

1948
01:08:24,691 --> 01:08:26,221
- She kissed her. - I missed you.

1949
01:08:26,222 --> 01:08:27,591
- I missed you. - Look at Ji Hyo.

1950
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:28,602
(It's how they greet each other.)

1951
01:08:29,292 --> 01:08:30,877
Wait.

1952
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:32,173
- What? - Nothing.

1953
01:08:32,531 --> 01:08:33,930
(What were you trying to say this time?)

1954
01:08:33,931 --> 01:08:35,831
- We... - This feels weird.

1955
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:37,043
It feels like an American soap opera.

1956
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,665
They're from "Mom's Diary", and they're from this show.

1957
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,624
Both of them are close to him.

1958
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,911
- It's Hollywood. - This is the States.

1959
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,211
(It's like they're shooting an American soap opera.)

1960
01:08:47,212 --> 01:08:48,292
- Just move on. - All right.

1961
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:50,680
- You should wear it well. - Is this even possible?

1962
01:08:50,681 --> 01:08:52,650
- Hold on, let me see. - I can't do it.

1963
01:08:52,651 --> 01:08:53,863
How does the crown feel?

1964
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:55,190
It doesn't feel too good.

1965
01:08:55,191 --> 01:08:56,990
It's unstable.

1966
01:08:56,991 --> 01:08:58,708
But I'll have to withstand the weight of the crown.

1967
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:01,890
(She only has 1 chance to eat 4 in 60 seconds.)

1968
01:09:01,891 --> 01:09:03,360
- You can do it! - Let's go!

1969
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:04,390
Good luck.

1970
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:05,846
(Will she be able to make it?)

1971
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,461
Go.

1972
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:08,714
- My goodness. - Is this how it's like?

1973
01:09:09,132 --> 01:09:11,570
(They finally realize the true nature of the crown.)

1974
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:12,955
- What is that? - Come on.

1975
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:14,070
Is this how it works?

1976
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:15,788
- You have to snatch it. - Bite it.

1977
01:09:15,972 --> 01:09:18,334
Bite it, bite it.

1978
01:09:19,181 --> 01:09:21,211
- You did it. - Bite it.

1979
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:22,980
(The snack is in front of her mouth.)

1980
01:09:22,981 --> 01:09:24,467
That was good!

1981
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:28,883
- It's all right. - It went upwards.

1982
01:09:28,991 --> 01:09:30,820
- It's almost touching your nose. - Good, good.

1983
01:09:30,821 --> 01:09:32,610
- You're close! - What should I do?

1984
01:09:33,021 --> 01:09:35,113
- Jin Young, you have to do this. - What should I do?

1985
01:09:35,531 --> 01:09:36,860
- Please! - You have to!

1986
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:38,161
(Struggling)

1987
01:09:38,162 --> 01:09:39,212
Goodness.

1988
01:09:39,832 --> 01:09:42,093
This reminds me of a zombie movie that I watched recently.

1989
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:45,240
(Do I still...)

1990
01:09:45,241 --> 01:09:49,311
(look like Jin Young to you?)

1991
01:09:50,712 --> 01:09:51,894
- Good. - Good.

1992
01:09:52,141 --> 01:09:53,240
Raise your chin a bit.

1993
01:09:53,241 --> 01:09:54,341
- Good. - Good.

1994
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:55,463
Just bite it.

1995
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:57,810
- Don't swear. - Just bite it.

1996
01:09:57,811 --> 01:09:58,921
Bite it.

1997
01:09:58,922 --> 01:10:00,134
(She bites it.)

1998
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:01,520
- Good. - Well done.

1999
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:03,721
(She finally bites 1.)

2000
01:10:03,722 --> 01:10:05,221
- Good. - It's coming.

2001
01:10:05,222 --> 01:10:06,434
(She spots another chance.)

2002
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:09,490
(The second snack is right in front of her.)

2003
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:10,572
- Good! - Great!

2004
01:10:11,302 --> 01:10:12,961
(She seems to get it now.)

2005
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:14,001
Good!

2006
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,284
- Bite it! - Good job.

2007
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:16,971
(She's taking her time.)

2008
01:10:16,972 --> 01:10:17,971
It's spinning.

2009
01:10:17,972 --> 01:10:19,920
- It's coming. - You just need to wait.

2010
01:10:20,641 --> 01:10:24,110
(She has 15 seconds left and 1 more to go.)

2011
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:27,940
(Will Jin Young succeed?)

2012
01:10:27,941 --> 01:10:30,480
(The snack is in front of her mouth, )

2013
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:32,520
(but she misses it.)

2014
01:10:32,521 --> 01:10:33,850
- Oh, no! - Slowly.

2015
01:10:33,851 --> 01:10:34,890
- Yes! - Yes!

2016
01:10:34,891 --> 01:10:36,221
(She catches the snack.)

2017
01:10:36,222 --> 01:10:38,918
(Jin Young succeeds.)

2018
01:10:39,422 --> 01:10:41,631
(I came, and I ate.)

2019
01:10:41,632 --> 01:10:42,730
(Worship me.)

2020
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:44,651
You're the great Hong Jin Young!

2021
01:10:44,861 --> 01:10:46,900
- Jin Young. - You must trust me completely.

2022
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:48,770
- Rinse your mouth. - Rinse your mouth.

2023
01:10:48,771 --> 01:10:50,900
(She's just as competent as her partner Jong Kook...)

2024
01:10:50,901 --> 01:10:51,971
(and succeeds the mission.)

2025
01:10:51,972 --> 01:10:53,671
I'm the best

2026
01:10:53,672 --> 01:10:54,671
(Proud)

2027
01:10:54,672 --> 01:10:56,511
- She's hilarious. - Did I succeed?

2028
01:10:56,512 --> 01:10:58,240
- Yes, you did. - All right.

2029
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:59,453
We won.

2030
01:10:59,641 --> 01:11:01,196
Jin Young did so well.

2031
01:11:01,512 --> 01:11:03,211
This was a hard one.

2032
01:11:03,212 --> 01:11:04,494
All right.

2033
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,421
You will be able to have raw octopus for 5.90 dollars...

2034
01:11:06,422 --> 01:11:08,251
which is a lower price than your opponent's.

2035
01:11:08,252 --> 01:11:09,690
(They get to have raw octopus.)

2036
01:11:09,691 --> 01:11:11,761
Now, we can go eat raw octopus.

2037
01:11:11,762 --> 01:11:13,034
- That's great. - Thanks.

2038
01:11:13,222 --> 01:11:15,661
- You should come on our show again. - Yes.

2039
01:11:15,662 --> 01:11:17,509
- You've been... - All right.

2040
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:19,230
only focusing on "Mom's Diary".

2041
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:20,331
I'll visit you soon.

2042
01:11:20,332 --> 01:11:21,400
- Please do. - Come.

2043
01:11:21,401 --> 01:11:22,570
Running Man is family.

2044
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:23,801
- Right. - Of course.

2045
01:11:23,802 --> 01:11:24,841
You're family.

2046
01:11:24,842 --> 01:11:26,790
- Thanks, Jin Young. - No problem.

2047
01:11:26,842 --> 01:11:28,411
Thanks, Jin Young.

2048
01:11:28,412 --> 01:11:30,171
- I hope the meal rejuvenates me. - Me too.

2049
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:31,610
(They obtain the chance card and arrive at the restaurant.)

2050
01:11:31,611 --> 01:11:33,280
Since we don't have a choice in menu,

2051
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:34,695
- shall we just order? - Sure.

2052
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:36,310
- Ma'am. - Ma'am.

2053
01:11:36,311 --> 01:11:37,361
We'd like...

2054
01:11:37,481 --> 01:11:39,703
a serving that looks more like four servings.

2055
01:11:40,281 --> 01:11:41,280
(They can only order 1 serving.)

2056
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,350
You want her to give a lot.

2057
01:11:42,351 --> 01:11:45,421
- We'd like a really big octopus. - A huge one.

2058
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:47,311
The biggest one you have.

2059
01:11:48,491 --> 01:11:49,530
Thank you.

2060
01:11:49,531 --> 01:11:52,086
(They'll have it for 5.90 dollars.)

2061
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,698
Team Jong Kook has gone down to 5.90 dollars.

2062
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,070
- What? - 5.90 dollars?

2063
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:59,162
You can only order dishes that are under that price.

2064
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:01,762
Please pick a menu,

2065
01:12:01,972 --> 01:12:04,366
and have it for 5.90 dollars.

2066
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:06,610
Let's just open all of them in this column.

2067
01:12:06,611 --> 01:12:07,925
- Let's do that. - Sure.

2068
01:12:08,412 --> 01:12:09,865
- Let's go for the fourth one. - Let's pick the green one.

2069
01:12:10,012 --> 01:12:11,901
- All right. - I wanted to pick that.

2070
01:12:12,452 --> 01:12:13,491
- Fourth one. - Let's open it.

2071
01:12:13,552 --> 01:12:14,562
What is it?

2072
01:12:15,422 --> 01:12:16,751
(What is the 4th ranking?)

2073
01:12:16,752 --> 01:12:17,850
Please.

2074
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:20,091
(What is the 4th ranking?)

2075
01:12:20,092 --> 01:12:21,291
- Yukhoe? - Yukgaejang?

2076
01:12:21,292 --> 01:12:23,190
- I think it's yukgaejang. Yukhoe? - What?

2077
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:24,878
(Yukhoe)

2078
01:12:25,962 --> 01:12:28,270
(It may seem too raw to foreigners, )

2079
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,422
(but yukhoe is a rejuvenating dish.)

2080
01:12:30,472 --> 01:12:34,612
(But will they be able to find one that's under 5.90 dollars?)

2081
01:12:35,372 --> 01:12:36,610
- Yukhoe? - That's expensive.

2082
01:12:36,611 --> 01:12:38,631
- There's none that cheap. - That's expensive.

2083
01:12:38,681 --> 01:12:40,110
- That's expensive. - Yukhoe?

2084
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:41,680
(The meat itself is already expensive.)

2085
01:12:41,681 --> 01:12:42,780
It is.

2086
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:43,964
How can we eat this?

2087
01:12:44,082 --> 01:12:46,421
- This one's ridiculous. - The cheapest one would be...

2088
01:12:46,422 --> 01:12:47,997
seven dollars.

2089
01:12:48,151 --> 01:12:49,921
Aren't they usually over 10 dollars?

2090
01:12:49,922 --> 01:12:51,002
You're right.

2091
01:12:51,252 --> 01:12:54,120
- Your limit is 5.90 dollars. - I think we'll lose.

2092
01:12:54,222 --> 01:12:56,413
There's a place in Cheongdam-dong.

2093
01:12:56,592 --> 01:12:58,218
Korean beef yukhoe is 36 dollars.

2094
01:12:58,462 --> 01:13:00,522
- For bibimbap? - No, not that.

2095
01:13:00,702 --> 01:13:02,549
I think we've lost.

2096
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:04,841
- No, that's not true. - We're in trouble.

2097
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:07,600
(Don't lose hope!)

2098
01:13:07,601 --> 01:13:08,640
There's one that's 4.30 dollars.

2099
01:13:08,641 --> 01:13:10,056
- Where? - Where?

2100
01:13:10,172 --> 01:13:11,440
- Where? - Am I wrong?

2101
01:13:11,441 --> 01:13:13,158
- It's 4.50 dollars. - Where?

2102
01:13:13,342 --> 01:13:14,554
This is...

2103
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:17,132
- in Sejong University? - What do you mean?

2104
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,594
Is it inside the campus?

2105
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:19,934
- In the cafeteria? - Hold on.

2106
01:13:21,452 --> 01:13:22,967
I found one too,

2107
01:13:23,092 --> 01:13:25,617
- but it's six dollars. - It's cafeteria food.

2108
01:13:25,662 --> 01:13:28,020
Yukhoe bibimbap that is sold in the cafeteria...

2109
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:29,990
of Sejong University is 4.50 dollars.

2110
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:31,530
- That's so cheap. - It is.

2111
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:33,030
- Let's go. - 4.30 dollars is really cheap.

2112
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:34,041
It's 4.50 dollars.

2113
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:36,030
- Let's go right now. Hurry. - Goodness.

2114
01:13:36,031 --> 01:13:38,091
- That's too cheap. - It's so cheap.

2115
01:13:38,972 --> 01:13:40,587
- We're here. - The school hasn't...

2116
01:13:41,271 --> 01:13:44,171
opened yet for this semester.

2117
01:13:44,172 --> 01:13:45,222
They're still on their break.

2118
01:13:45,412 --> 01:13:47,835
- Is the cafeteria open, though? - Of course.

2119
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:50,204
I really enjoyed eating cafeteria food.

2120
01:13:50,512 --> 01:13:52,581
- Me too. - It was delicious.

2121
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:54,121
It's cheap and tasty.

2122
01:13:54,122 --> 01:13:55,751
(Reminiscing)

2123
01:13:55,752 --> 01:13:57,812
- Ramyeon were good too. - You're right.

2124
01:13:57,851 --> 01:13:59,104
They probably have ramyeon here.

2125
01:13:59,222 --> 01:14:01,111
- They have so many dishes. - Things have changed.

2126
01:14:01,162 --> 01:14:02,606
- Look at the menu. - It changes automatically.

2127
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:04,608
- Is this a kiosk? - There's a variety.

2128
01:14:05,132 --> 01:14:06,360
- Goodness. - Wow.

2129
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:07,831
I see yukhoe bibimbap.

2130
01:14:07,832 --> 01:14:09,570
They even have spicy chicken bibimbap.

2131
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,841
They look so delicious. I want an omelet as well.

2132
01:14:11,842 --> 01:14:13,760
- They have Japanese cuisine too. - I want an omelet.

2133
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:15,740
We can only have one, right?

2134
01:14:15,741 --> 01:14:16,841
(They pay through a machine.)

2135
01:14:16,842 --> 01:14:18,171
Goodness.

2136
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:19,240
- It's out. - There's...

2137
01:14:19,241 --> 01:14:21,363
- a huge variety of menus. - That's your receipt.

2138
01:14:22,052 --> 01:14:24,102
- "Rice served with grilled fish." - It looks good.

2139
01:14:24,552 --> 01:14:25,864
I suddenly became hungry.

2140
01:14:27,552 --> 01:14:30,077
(Team Jong Kook has ordered raw octopus.)

2141
01:14:30,922 --> 01:14:33,921
(1st, she stretches the octopus.)

2142
01:14:33,922 --> 01:14:36,890
(2nd, she lays it down and cuts it.)

2143
01:14:37,531 --> 01:14:39,581
I couldn't eat this back then because it was too expensive.

2144
01:14:40,132 --> 01:14:41,142
It's out.

2145
01:14:42,372 --> 01:14:44,371
You should dip it in this oil sauce.

2146
01:14:44,372 --> 01:14:47,674
(He dips it in the oil sauce before putting it in his mouth.)

2147
01:14:49,372 --> 01:14:52,081
(It has a firm texture.)

2148
01:14:52,082 --> 01:14:53,810
- It's so delicious. - Listen to the sound.

2149
01:14:53,811 --> 01:14:55,951
(Eating it is a blast.)

2150
01:14:55,952 --> 01:14:57,610
- I dipped it too much. - It's all right.

2151
01:14:57,611 --> 01:14:59,702
(They get to eat it for a very cheap price.)

2152
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:02,062
Hold it.

2153
01:15:02,622 --> 01:15:03,661
Good.

2154
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:08,366
(She assists Jong Kook.)

2155
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:11,131
(Gazing)

2156
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:14,090
(He ponders whether or not to tease them.)

2157
01:15:16,632 --> 01:15:17,770
He saw you.

2158
01:15:17,771 --> 01:15:19,100
(Just when he was about to tease them...)

2159
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:21,711
Jong Kook stared at him the moment he was about to say something.

2160
01:15:21,712 --> 01:15:23,187
I was contemplating.

2161
01:15:23,872 --> 01:15:25,054
But looking at his face, I don't think I can.

2162
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:26,680
You're lucky today.

2163
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,934
You are sitting far from me.

2164
01:15:29,452 --> 01:15:30,650
- It's no wonder... - That's right.

2165
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,581
he kept asking me to sit in the middle.

2166
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:35,490
(I will hold myself back.)

2167
01:15:35,491 --> 01:15:37,990
(Ji Hyo has dried laver on her lips.)

2168
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,679
Ji Hyo, you have something on your lips.

2169
01:15:40,122 --> 01:15:41,161
Jong Kook, you should...

2170
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,261
(Hesitant)

2171
01:15:44,262 --> 01:15:45,600
You should check her lips.

2172
01:15:45,601 --> 01:15:47,131
Se Chan, do I have something on my lips?

2173
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:48,172
Let me see.

2174
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:50,001
- No, you don't. - Look closely.

2175
01:15:50,002 --> 01:15:51,471
(They become nervous.)

2176
01:15:51,472 --> 01:15:53,240
- You are set. - Check the person on your right.

2177
01:15:53,241 --> 01:15:54,281
Okay.

2178
01:15:54,601 --> 01:15:56,310
- Is it a relay? - Yes, it is.

2179
01:15:56,311 --> 01:15:57,711
(A relay lip care starts.)

2180
01:15:57,712 --> 01:15:59,610
You are set. Check his lips. It's a relay.

2181
01:15:59,611 --> 01:16:01,011
- Check his lips. - Check.

2182
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:03,011
(Moving closer)

2183
01:16:03,012 --> 01:16:06,221
(Jong Kook, let me check your lips.)

2184
01:16:06,222 --> 01:16:07,850
Okay. We have a trailer.

2185
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,451
(We did it again today!)

2186
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:11,785
Haha, you are working hard today.

2187
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:13,291
You are working hard today.

2188
01:16:13,292 --> 01:16:15,030
(They cleared 1 serving of raw octopus.)

2189
01:16:15,031 --> 01:16:17,586
Ji Hyo. You should pick a wire this time.

2190
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,273
- A wire? - Yes.

2191
01:16:19,531 --> 01:16:21,178
- Should I pick a wire? - Yes.

2192
01:16:21,632 --> 01:16:24,631
It's pain to cut a wire.

2193
01:16:24,632 --> 01:16:26,341
- It's so nerve-wracking. - Since you and I have done it,

2194
01:16:26,342 --> 01:16:27,541
either Jae Seok or Kwang Soo should do it.

2195
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:28,622
I can't do it.

2196
01:16:28,712 --> 01:16:30,640
The chance is down to 33.3 percent.

2197
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:31,640
(The chance of the bomb exploding is down to 33.3 percent.)

2198
01:16:31,641 --> 01:16:34,480
If our bomb doesn't go off this time, we will win.

2199
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:35,751
We will win.

2200
01:16:35,752 --> 01:16:37,350
How many wires do we have left? We have three wires left.

2201
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:40,621
Their bomb has a wire with a different color.

2202
01:16:40,622 --> 01:16:42,005
- Let's pick the yellow wire. - The yellow wire?

2203
01:16:42,052 --> 01:16:44,850
- What? Good thinking. - You have a point.

2204
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:47,719
There must be a reason why it has a different color.

2205
01:16:47,762 --> 01:16:48,930
- The yellow wire. - The yellow wire.

2206
01:16:48,931 --> 01:16:49,972
- The yellow wire. - All right.

2207
01:16:50,162 --> 01:16:51,403
- The yellow wire. - Okay.

2208
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:52,530
Okay.

2209
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:55,971
(Team Jong Kook attacks the yellow wire.)

2210
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,530
- I don't think that's the wire. - You know,

2211
01:16:57,531 --> 01:16:59,258
the yellow wire is what I picked the first time.

2212
01:16:59,972 --> 01:17:01,440
- That makes me worried. - I have a bad feeling about this.

2213
01:17:01,441 --> 01:17:03,211
I think it's one of these two.

2214
01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:04,711
- My goodness. - The blue wire...

2215
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:06,256
Hey, hey. Don't cut it without a warning.

2216
01:17:07,641 --> 01:17:08,911
Are you going to cut it?

2217
01:17:08,912 --> 01:17:10,830
(The chance of the bomb going off is 33.3 percent.)

2218
01:17:12,021 --> 01:17:14,020
In 1, 2, 3.

2219
01:17:14,021 --> 01:17:16,390
(If the bomb goes off, the race will end right away...)

2220
01:17:16,391 --> 01:17:18,816
(and Team Jong Kook will win.)

2221
01:17:18,962 --> 01:17:21,042
(What will be the result?)

2222
01:17:21,521 --> 01:17:23,761
(Cutting)

2223
01:17:23,762 --> 01:17:26,001
(The bomb doesn't go off. Team Jong Kook's attack fails.)

2224
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:27,360
- It wasn't that wire. - Yes!

2225
01:17:27,361 --> 01:17:28,471
- It wasn't the yellow wire. - Yes!

2226
01:17:28,472 --> 01:17:29,744
No, it wasn't.

2227
01:17:30,172 --> 01:17:32,495
- It wasn't the yellow wire. - This is nerve-wracking.

2228
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:33,570
It wasn't the yellow wire.

2229
01:17:33,571 --> 01:17:34,740
(That was close.)

2230
01:17:34,741 --> 01:17:36,691
- This is incredible. - How did we survive for so long?

2231
01:17:37,441 --> 01:17:38,640
We survived.

2232
01:17:38,641 --> 01:17:39,792
(There is a 50-percent chance of explosion the next time.)

2233
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:41,751
Let's eat.

2234
01:17:41,752 --> 01:17:42,780
- Yukhoe bibimbap. - Now,

2235
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:44,428
their bomb will go off if we eat and cut a wire.

2236
01:17:44,981 --> 01:17:46,031
Let's end them.

2237
01:17:47,082 --> 01:17:49,751
(Freshly-cooked rice gets topped...)

2238
01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,791
We only ordered one dish, but there is so much to eat.

2239
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:52,791
(with various vegetables.)

2240
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:55,430
It looks amazing. There are so many toppings.

2241
01:17:55,431 --> 01:17:57,791
(A happiness of 4 dollars and 50 cents)

2242
01:17:57,792 --> 01:17:59,961
- Sesame oil. - Look at this.

2243
01:17:59,962 --> 01:18:01,072
(She is excited.)

2244
01:18:01,832 --> 01:18:02,842
This is unbelievable.

2245
01:18:03,002 --> 01:18:05,001
- Isn't it hearty? - So Min, it looks delicious.

2246
01:18:05,002 --> 01:18:06,012
My goodness.

2247
01:18:06,872 --> 01:18:08,301
Can't I eat this?

2248
01:18:08,302 --> 01:18:10,029
Can't we have a serving for each?

2249
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:12,180
Eat it with chopsticks.

2250
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:13,899
There is so much yukhoe.

2251
01:18:14,382 --> 01:18:16,610
- It's tasty. - It's tasty, right?

2252
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:18,350
(Both Kwang Soo and Seok Jin are satisfied.)

2253
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:19,635
There is so much yukhoe.

2254
01:18:20,281 --> 01:18:21,362
It's tasty, too.

2255
01:18:21,422 --> 01:18:23,472
All the dishes we had are tasty.

2256
01:18:25,052 --> 01:18:27,461
(They finish the dish in an instant.)

2257
01:18:27,462 --> 01:18:29,890
(Team Jae Seok cleared 1 serving of yukhoe.)

2258
01:18:29,891 --> 01:18:31,230
Is it our turn to choose?

2259
01:18:31,231 --> 01:18:33,151
Yes. The other team will have their bomb ready.

2260
01:18:33,431 --> 01:18:35,230
- Is it their turn to attack? - Yes.

2261
01:18:35,231 --> 01:18:36,770
- It's their turn to attack. - Our bomb?

2262
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:38,871
Let's check the result outside.

2263
01:18:38,872 --> 01:18:40,100
- Okay. - It's their turn to attack us.

2264
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:41,283
- They will set off our bomb. - Our bomb.

2265
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:44,465
If we don't end them this round, we will get wiped out.

2266
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:46,011
- If we fail... - There won't be another chance.

2267
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:47,381
There won't be another chance. It's a 50-50 chance.

2268
01:18:47,382 --> 01:18:48,452
There are only two wires left.

2269
01:18:49,281 --> 01:18:50,423
This game needs to end here.

2270
01:18:50,582 --> 01:18:51,692
Which wire should we pick?

2271
01:18:52,622 --> 01:18:54,400
Shall we pick a wire we don't have like they did?

2272
01:18:54,452 --> 01:18:55,990
We don't have a green wire,

2273
01:18:55,991 --> 01:18:57,490
but they do.

2274
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:58,690
(Team Jong Kook's bomb has a green wire.)

2275
01:18:58,691 --> 01:19:00,985
I wanted to pick the green wire.

2276
01:19:01,222 --> 01:19:02,808
I wanted to pick the red wire from the start.

2277
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:05,161
Red is the color of fire.

2278
01:19:05,162 --> 01:19:08,161
Now, let's pick between the green and red wire...

2279
01:19:08,162 --> 01:19:09,671
by flipping a coin.

2280
01:19:09,672 --> 01:19:11,923
- Let's do it. - Let's use various methods.

2281
01:19:12,241 --> 01:19:14,041
- Okay. - This is an important decision.

2282
01:19:14,042 --> 01:19:15,371
It's bound to go off in the next round.

2283
01:19:15,372 --> 01:19:18,402
- Tail means red. - Red.

2284
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:20,310
- Head means green. - Green.

2285
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:22,280
(Tail means red and head means green.)

2286
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:25,282
(The coin is tossed.)

2287
01:19:26,351 --> 01:19:28,421
(The fate of the game lies in his hands.)

2288
01:19:28,422 --> 01:19:29,421
- Shall we go? - Yes.

2289
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:31,209
In 1, 2, 3.

2290
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:38,331
(The legendary unlucky man, Kwang Soo picked the red wire.)

2291
01:19:38,332 --> 01:19:42,001
(The classic unlucky man, Jae Seok picked the green wire.)

2292
01:19:42,002 --> 01:19:45,240
(What will be the result?)

2293
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:47,871
(It's Kwang Soo's pick, red wire.)

2294
01:19:47,872 --> 01:19:49,511
- What is this? - It's red.

2295
01:19:49,512 --> 01:19:50,511
- Red. - Red.

2296
01:19:50,512 --> 01:19:52,640
- Let's go with the red wire. - We choose the red wire.

2297
01:19:52,641 --> 01:19:53,680
- Let's shout it. - Red.

2298
01:19:53,681 --> 01:19:54,780
In 1, 2, 3.

2299
01:19:54,781 --> 01:19:55,821
- Red. - Red.

2300
01:19:56,582 --> 01:19:59,350
Team Jae Seok picked red.

2301
01:19:59,351 --> 01:20:00,381
- Red? - Yes.

2302
01:20:00,382 --> 01:20:02,745
- I don't think it's red. - I think the bomb will go off.

2303
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:05,175
I think the bomb will go off.

2304
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:06,690
Then let's bring our hands together.

2305
01:20:06,691 --> 01:20:07,975
- I will hold your hands. - Help me.

2306
01:20:08,092 --> 01:20:09,091
- Okay. - Let's bring our hands together.

2307
01:20:09,092 --> 01:20:10,961
- Okay. - Hold it this way.

2308
01:20:10,962 --> 01:20:12,201
(Team Jong Kook has 3 wires left.)

2309
01:20:12,202 --> 01:20:13,515
Why do I feel nervous?

2310
01:20:14,162 --> 01:20:15,344
All right. Get ready.

2311
01:20:15,832 --> 01:20:16,882
Hold on.

2312
01:20:17,872 --> 01:20:20,628
In 1, 2, 3.

2313
01:20:23,741 --> 01:20:26,440
(If the bomb goes off, the race will end right away.)

2314
01:20:26,441 --> 01:20:28,341
Please. Please.

2315
01:20:28,342 --> 01:20:29,850
(Team Jae Seok will win.)

2316
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:32,953
(What will be the result?)

2317
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:39,320
(Exploding)

2318
01:20:39,321 --> 01:20:41,961
I knew the red wire would make the bomb go off.

2319
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,291
(Team Jong Kook lost.)

2320
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:45,048
- What just happened? Did we lose? - Was it the red wire?

2321
01:20:45,561 --> 01:20:46,730
Okay!

2322
01:20:46,731 --> 01:20:49,331
(Team Jae Seok won.)

2323
01:20:49,332 --> 01:20:51,221
- We did it! - Who needs Penalty Exemption Card?

2324
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:53,865
(The great unlucky man)

2325
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:56,711
(Mom, I am proud that I am unlucky.)

2326
01:20:56,712 --> 01:20:57,853
Gosh, this is...

2327
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:00,280
(It's time for the penalty.)

2328
01:21:00,281 --> 01:21:02,675
The winner of The Bomb Is About to Explode...

2329
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:04,511
is Team Jae Seok.

2330
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,650
(Team Jae Seok wins The Bomb Is About to Explode.)

2331
01:21:06,651 --> 01:21:08,581
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

2332
01:21:08,582 --> 01:21:09,591
(Disappointed)

2333
01:21:09,592 --> 01:21:11,591
How did they find yukhoe?

2334
01:21:11,592 --> 01:21:14,261
It was very difficult for us to win.

2335
01:21:14,262 --> 01:21:15,631
I know.

2336
01:21:15,632 --> 01:21:17,631
- Congratulations. - I thought they would win.

2337
01:21:17,632 --> 01:21:18,631
Congratulations.

2338
01:21:18,632 --> 01:21:21,131
For Team Jong Kook,

2339
01:21:21,132 --> 01:21:23,454
the original penalty we had in mind was the water bomb.

2340
01:21:24,031 --> 01:21:25,557
Since the weather is too cold,

2341
01:21:26,672 --> 01:21:28,140
(The weather is too cold.)

2342
01:21:28,141 --> 01:21:31,374
they will get a water slap from the winning team.

2343
01:21:31,611 --> 01:21:33,541
- From the winning team? - Yes.

2344
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:35,081
That's a bit annoying.

2345
01:21:35,082 --> 01:21:37,011
- A water slap? - Gosh, my ears are freezing.

2346
01:21:37,012 --> 01:21:38,062
My goodness.

2347
01:21:38,181 --> 01:21:42,721
(At that moment, Haha moves stealthily.)

2348
01:21:42,722 --> 01:21:44,921
- I can't believe it. - Haha won't get the penalty.

2349
01:21:44,922 --> 01:21:46,520
- Penalty Exemption Card? - Do you have it?

2350
01:21:46,521 --> 01:21:48,955
I did it!

2351
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:52,993
Three people will get the penalty. Who will hit Jong Kook?

2352
01:21:53,332 --> 01:21:55,831
(I, Seok Jin, will do it.)

2353
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:57,822
- Those are 3 bowls. - Those are 3 bowls.

2354
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,285
Seok Jin, it's obvious those are three bowls.

2355
01:21:59,302 --> 01:22:01,765
- He is very angry. - Right.

2356
01:22:02,342 --> 01:22:03,440
Gosh, it's cold.

2357
01:22:03,441 --> 01:22:05,341
(It's time for revenge.)

2358
01:22:05,342 --> 01:22:07,765
In 1, 2, 3. Have a good year!

2359
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:11,881
(Splashing)

2360
01:22:11,882 --> 01:22:14,174
- Gosh, it's cold. - It's like a water bomb.

2361
01:22:14,452 --> 01:22:16,721
- It was a proper slap. - Water splashed on me, too.

2362
01:22:16,722 --> 01:22:18,091
(He is proud that he had his revenge.)

2363
01:22:18,092 --> 01:22:19,490
- My goodness. - That's how you do it.

2364
01:22:19,491 --> 01:22:20,560
That was nice.

2365
01:22:20,561 --> 01:22:21,661
It's Se Chan's turn.

2366
01:22:21,662 --> 01:22:22,831
Se Chan.

2367
01:22:22,832 --> 01:22:25,286
- It's cold. - I will do this for you.

2368
01:22:25,401 --> 01:22:27,430
You need good techniques.

2369
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:28,846
- Use the snap of your wrist. - I will push back your hair.

2370
01:22:29,332 --> 01:22:32,200
(Splashing)

2371
01:22:32,271 --> 01:22:33,740
(The water slap pushes back his bangs.)

2372
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:34,801
I pushed back his hair.

2373
01:22:34,802 --> 01:22:36,471
- That was incredible. - Right?

2374
01:22:36,472 --> 01:22:37,754
You need good techniques.

2375
01:22:38,611 --> 01:22:40,126
You need good techniques.

2376
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:42,180
I don't have good techniques.

2377
01:22:42,181 --> 01:22:43,411
(He apologizes in advance.)

2378
01:22:43,412 --> 01:22:45,451
(Ji Hyo is the sacrifice of the inexperienced Kwang Soo.)

2379
01:22:45,452 --> 01:22:47,299
- All right. - Have a good year, Ji Hyo!

2380
01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,640
(Splashing)

2381
01:22:49,691 --> 01:22:53,459
(A textbook water slap without any techniques)

2382
01:22:53,821 --> 01:22:56,831
In conclusion, Team Jae Seok won the race today.

2383
01:22:56,832 --> 01:23:00,230
(The race ended with the unlucky members' victory.)

2384
01:23:00,231 --> 01:23:01,474
This is great.

2385
01:23:02,832 --> 01:23:05,940
(Running Man gets dragged away without any information.)

2386
01:23:05,941 --> 01:23:07,740
(I am sorry, but where are we going?)

2387
01:23:07,741 --> 01:23:11,570
(The 8 members get locked up for no reason.)

2388
01:23:11,571 --> 01:23:12,723
(100-minute House?)

2389
01:23:13,611 --> 01:23:16,110
(They only have 100 minutes.)

2390
01:23:16,111 --> 01:23:18,680
(They must complete missions in 100 minutes to escape.)

2391
01:23:18,681 --> 01:23:21,711
(They continue to get missions that are related to 100.)

2392
01:23:22,491 --> 01:23:24,844
(Does someone know the secret of 100?)

2393
01:23:24,891 --> 01:23:27,060
(Some members want to unearth the secret...)

2394
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:28,981
(while some members want to hide the secret.)

2395
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:33,560
(What is the secret of 100?)

2396
01:23:33,561 --> 01:23:35,218
(I got goosebumps.)

2397
01:23:35,531 --> 01:23:37,551
(The Secret of 100)
