1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,808
- Hello. - Hi.

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:08,808
- Hello. - Hello.

3
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,294
- Hi. - Hi.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,438
- Good morning. - Hello.

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,908
"Morning"? It's 1pm now.

6
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,179
- Hello. - Come on.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,836
What is it? Why?

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,819
He just said, "good morning".

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,849
- It must be morning for him. - Hello.

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,219
- It's 1pm right now. - That's right. It's 1pm.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,240
It's 1pm. It's the same for me.

12
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:27,752
- What's the same? - Whether it's 1pm or 9pm.

13
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,940
What's the same?

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,343
My mood is the same.

15
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,368
- Is that what you meant? - I feel the same.

16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,868
- You're always in a bad mood. - No, I'm good.

17
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,068
You're always in a bad mood.

18
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:36,887
We started even before we lined up.

19
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,138
- I'm always in a good mood. - Seok Jin.

20
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,583
- It's awful these days. - I always feel good.

21
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:41,588
- He gets angrier and more annoying. - No.

22
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,409
- But he doesn't know that. - Hey.

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,008
- He doesn't know he gets like that. - No. What would I gain from it?

24
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:47,578
- See? You're angry now. - No, no.

25
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:48,578
- You aren't angry? - I'm smiling.

26
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:50,078
(He's smiling to make a living.)

27
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,049
- He has anger management issue. - No, no. Not at all.

28
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,288
- Does he have menopause? - He has anger management issue.

29
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,958
- No, no. Not at all. - But you know what?

30
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,958
He's my junior comedian, but he acts really cheeky with me.

31
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:00,111
- Come on. - You should teach him a lesson.

32
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,582
- Hey, are you serious? - You should scold him once.

33
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,059
- I'll hold him for you. - Jong Kook said...

34
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,575
- Did you hear what he just said? - What?

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,398
He said I should scold you.

36
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,729
- You should scold him. - What?

37
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,538
- Scold me? - A junior can't be that rude.

38
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,731
- My goodness! - He must have boundaries.

39
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,668
- He hates when juniors overstep. - Right.

40
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,538
- There has to be a fixed system. - What about you?

41
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,590
Why are you rude to me?

42
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,708
- Me? I was never rude to you. - Why are you rude to me?

43
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:21,678
- What are you talking about? - Why do I always gather my hands...

44
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:22,830
in front of you?

45
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,808
He stuttered. He just stuttered.

46
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,588
- Why am I acting small? - I was never rude to you.

47
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,818
- Why? - I was always nice to you.

48
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:32,719
- Goodness, I don't know why. - That's funny.

49
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,058
- That was funny. By the way, - That's enough.

50
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:38,398
Se Chan, did you see the show? So Min...

51
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,622
- has a wish. - Okay.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,059
She wants two guys to fight over her.

53
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,645
She wants a family to fall apart because of her.

54
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,808
(So Min, choose. Is it Se Chan or Se Hyeong?)

55
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:54,808
These brothers will...

56
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,678
(You'll create a rift between two brothers.)

57
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:58,678
(Do you know what my wish is?)

58
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:00,349
(It's to be in a love triangle.)

59
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,490
(My wish is breaking apart a family.)

60
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:07,558
(So Min is a destroyer of siblings, the promising femme fatal.)

61
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,478
- Hey, don't get my family involved. - She wants brothers to fight.

62
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,326
Don't you see that in dramas?

63
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,929
Se Hyeong told me about that after he finished filming.

64
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,268
- Didn't he say it was hard? - "Hey, So Min is really crazy."

65
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,638
(Her reputation stays true.)

66
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,144
"I can't handle her." He told me that.

67
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,179
Jae Seok. Jae Seok. I'll tell you something funny.

68
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,149
- Last week, So Min... - Why are we talking about this?

69
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,200
- called Jong Kook herself. - Really?

70
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,589
- She asked him out for coffee. - Really?

71
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,288
(So Min Calls Jong Kook in Private for Coffee)

72
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:36,288
- So what happened? - They've gotten close lately.

73
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,189
- Why did you do that? - Why did you do it?

74
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,858
Why? Why? Why did you two have coffee all of a sudden?

75
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:40,959
- Why did you do it? - That was crazy.

76
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,828
- We're close now. - You are?

77
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,559
- We're close. - Just the two of you met?

78
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,125
- No, of course, not. - I was alone when it snowed.

79
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,568
I had no one to meet up with.

80
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,741
I always meet up with the same people.

81
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,209
(She means them.)

82
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,735
I wanted to hang out with someone new.

83
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,636
I thought that Jong Kook was relatively new to me.

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,078
I asked him to hang out with me in a text.

85
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,279
Jong Kook wrote, "All of a sudden"? But he said yes right away...

86
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,775
and told me to come to this address, so I went.

87
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:08,918
(She went to the address Jong Kook sent her.)

88
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,459
- There were three handsome guys. - Right away?

89
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,219
- Those guys were there? - It was already set up.

90
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,488
My gosh, So Min.

91
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,327
- And one more man was rushing over. - Let's hear this out.

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
- Who? - Kwang Soo.

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,168
- Kwang Soo. - Why did you go there?

94
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:23,138
- He ruined everything. - Everything was ruined.

95
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:24,698
- Everything was ruined. - It was all ruined.

96
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,209
I'm not sure if I should say this on TV.

97
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,638
Jong Kook said it was uncomfortable to meet her alone.

98
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,608
(Jong Kook said it was uncomfortable to meet her alone.)

99
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,208
He told me not to say this, so I wasn't going to say this.

100
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,249
- "So Min suddenly wants to meet." - But still.

101
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,350
- You were uncomfortable. - He begged me to join him.

102
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:43,018
He used the word, "please".

103
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:44,589
As soon as So Min texted me,

104
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,013
I called every guy I knew.

105
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,754
You made an effort though.

106
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,547
By the way, every female member...

107
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:56,038
has become Jong Kook's love interest now.

108
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,499
(He has potentials to date every female member.)

109
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,227
- Look at this. - What are you talking about?

110
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,939
He looks like a playboy.

111
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,439
- Look. - He's a playboy.

112
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,978
(In other words, he's like a playboy.)

113
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,048
- What are you saying? Playboy? - I mean...

114
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,779
My goodness, I feel bad for you, Ji Hyo.

115
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,254
- I feel bad for you, Ji Hyo. - You were with Ji Hyo last week.

116
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,959
- I see them as my family. - Poor you.

117
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,059
I thought So Min would take that title, but I guess I was wrong.

118
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,829
(The playboy character belonged to someone else.)

119
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,243
It was Jong Kook who took it.

120
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,780
He's not the playboy. He's Flirty Kook.

121
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,928
- Flirty Kook? - Flirty Kook.

122
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:30,238
- He's Flirty Kook. - Listen. Seriously.

123
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,938
- That's not it. - That's funny.

124
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,323
- Sister-in-law. - Brother-in-law.

125
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,509
- Let's go. - Cross!

126
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,934
(All of a sudden, the sister-in-law and the brother-in-law cross.)

127
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,709
- What was that? - "Brother-in-law"?

128
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,248
- Hey. - Look at you.

129
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,279
- "Brother-in-law." - That came out of nowhere.

130
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,579
(Is she finally admitting the relationship?)

131
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,115
She's not happy that she might lose Jong Kook to So Min.

132
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,188
Ji Hyo doesn't want to have him, but doesn't want to give him away.

133
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,483
He called her honey last week.

134
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,558
- He did call me that. - He practically proposed to her.

135
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:57,228
- He's already her brother-in-law? - I didn't know it moved that fast.

136
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,928
- Hey, you. - That startled me.

137
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:00,344
- What is this? - Look at you joking around.

138
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,825
(What was that?)

139
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,699
- Hey, you. - That startled me.

140
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,038
(What is this mysterious video on the screen?)

141
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,108
- What is that? - What is it?

142
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:09,909
Starting now...

143
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,809
(What is this mysterious voice that's talking to the members?)

144
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,149
(Look at you joking around.)

145
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,199
Starting now, I will...

146
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,814
make you extremely nervous as a gift from me to you.

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,275
I am a honeybee who came to...

148
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:25,889
bring you to judgment.

149
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,151
(I am a honeybee who came to bring you to judgment.)

150
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:29,340
I'm a honeybee.

151
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,998
He's cute. What is this?

152
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,040
He's cute.

153
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,099
- Isn't he trying to copy Jigsaw? - He's cute.

154
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,668
- He's Jigsaw. - He does resemble the character.

155
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,969
- What is he doing? - He looks so cute.

156
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,555
He's cute. What is this?

157
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,140
The first member whom I'll bring to judgment is...

158
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,709
Kim Jong Kook.

159
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,808
(It's Kim Jong Kook.)

160
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,209
- Why? Why? - Who?

161
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,608
- Why him? - It's Kim Jong Kook.

162
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:49,618
(The first target of the honeybee's judgment is Kim Jong Kook.)

163
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,508
(Why will he be brought to justice?)

164
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:55,889
Regardless of their age, you dominate them by force.

165
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,918
- That came out of the blue. - That's right.

166
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,759
- All of a sudden? - You terrorize the members...

167
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,689
- with scary comments. - That's true.

168
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,459
I will let you take revenge by giving you a chance...

169
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,146
to eliminate him right away.

170
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,738
I will let you take revenge...

171
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:13,038
(I will give you a chance to eliminate him right away.)

172
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,269
He'll be eliminated right away?

173
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,482
- Hey. - What?

174
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,878
- We can eliminate him now? - What?

175
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,051
Why would you do that to me?

176
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,193
The method is very simple.

177
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,149
We will have a secret ballot to see if you agree or not.

178
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,779
- If the majority agrees, - No way.

179
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,042
- What is this? - Jong Kook will be eliminated.

180
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:31,724
However, in order to vote, you need ballots.

181
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,329
If you complete the group mission...

182
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,178
- within your given chances, - Really?

183
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,522
everyone will be given a ballot.

184
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:39,010
If you fail,

185
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,298
only seven ballots will be given out.

186
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,026
One of them will lose his or her right to vote.

187
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,668
- What is this? - If Jong Kook is eliminated,

188
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,942
one of the members who agreed and members...

189
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,030
who didn't have the voting right will be chosen.

190
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:56,178
If Jong Kook survives the voting, the next target...

191
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,488
will be chosen by Jong Kook.

192
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:01,206
(Jong Kook will choose the next target if he survives.)

193
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,058
- Is that so? - My goodness.

194
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,759
- Hold on. - It won't be just Jong Kook.

195
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,558
- We must think carefully. - Goodness.

196
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,829
(If they eliminate Jong Kook, they might be the next target.)

197
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,516
We have to use our brain for this.

198
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,298
Hey, we have to play this right.

199
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,390
By the way, that honeybee...

200
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,298
didn't make groundless accusations.

201
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:18,714
- Hold on. - To tell you the truth...

202
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,181
It was all correct.

203
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:22,998
- Right. - The honeybee only spoke the truth.

204
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,248
- Well... - The honeybee wasn't lying.

205
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:27,909
(The honeybee's report on Jong Kook)

206
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,092
(Hammering)

207
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,488
(Regardless of age, he uses his muscles to dominate over others.)

208
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:38,288
(If someone is bothersome, he takes them to a blind spot.)

209
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,628
(He shows off his power on a variety show.)

210
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,690
(He makes the show about rescuing the members.)

211
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:47,368
(The first target is Kim Jong Kook.)

212
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:48,682
I can already be eliminated?

213
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,298
Already? I get that you'll vote.

214
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,909
There's no reason to eliminate him though.

215
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,139
Yes, why would we eliminate him?

216
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,726
(Look at his facial expression.)

217
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,409
(Who would want to eliminate my dear Jong Kook?)

218
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,449
(He's speechless.)

219
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,521
You'll vote yes, right?

220
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,865
- You'll vote yes, right? - My goodness.

221
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,118
- Right? - You'll vote.

222
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,618
- Won't you vote? - Are you getting things going?

223
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,688
- Look at his face. - He's already...

224
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:08,918
- setting it up. - Hey.

225
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,233
We can eliminate him from the start?

226
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:12,858
We didn't finish the opening segment, but he'll go to jail?

227
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,910
(What a lucky day it is!)

228
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,358
(The actor of 10 years is putting on his best show.)

229
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:19,899
- How could you do this to him? - He's setting it up now.

230
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,969
Why would we want to eliminate him?

231
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,524
I hate that look when he tries to look innocent.

232
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,652
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

233
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,182
What an awful honeybee!

234
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,193
Don't you dare test our loyalty!

235
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,139
Hey, let me make myself clear.

236
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,048
If you eliminate him, I won't let you slide.

237
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,090
You.

238
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,949
- I meant it. - Jae Seok.

239
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,596
The corners of your mouth are moving upward.

240
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,248
- He's very playful. - You're smiling.

241
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,419
- You know me, right? - What?

242
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,975
If I catch you, I won't let that slide.

243
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,289
- He's acting weird. - I won't let that slide.

244
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,300
Jong Kook, just trust me.

245
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,760
All right. Today, we have received a request from the honeybee.

246
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,799
And we have prepared Honeybee's Counterattack Race.

247
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,398
- What is this? - Honeybee?

248
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,127
You must get to the bottom of this race's secret.

249
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,055
The moment you eliminate the honeybee,

250
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,340
the race will end.

251
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:05,631
- Someone is honeybee? - The honeybee is one of us?

252
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,061
Is the honeybee one of us?

253
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,293
- The honeybee is here? - Among us?

254
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,194
- Who is that honeybee? - He's flustered.

255
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,076
You keep moving forward. Are you the honeybee?

256
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,689
What's wrong with your fist?

257
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,932
That's the honey punch.

258
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:19,488
That's the honey punch. It's the honey punch.

259
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,378
- Hold on. - That's right. The honey punch.

260
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,658
- The honey punch. - The honey punch.

261
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:23,669
It's not me.

262
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:24,941
- It's the honey punch. - It's sweet.

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,512
He is the honeybee.

264
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:27,768
- It's not me. - It's the honey punch.

265
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,658
- It's not me. - He's the Suyuri Honey Punch.

266
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,398
You fools. There you go again today.

267
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,768
- Why would that be a honeybee? - Don't think I'm the honeybee.

268
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:34,880
Isn't he the Suyuri Honey Punch?

269
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,525
We must match the honeybee.

270
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,226
- Match the honeybee? - We should catch it.

271
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,126
What do you mean we should match the honeybee?

272
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,724
It's not me. Don't get the wrong idea.

273
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,999
The group mission to earn the ballots is called...

274
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,648
- Link Between You and Me. - Link.

275
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:47,933
- It's a link. - Okay.

276
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,040
You will try the mission as pairs.

277
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,589
Within the time limit, if any of the pairs separate...

278
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,658
the intersected ropes which are tied on your wrists,

279
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:58,710
you have accomplished your mission then.

280
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,829
- That's nice. - Okay.

281
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,415
- We can totally complete this. - We can do this.

282
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:03,712
Of course.

283
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,898
First, pair up.

284
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,669
Why don't you two pair up then?

285
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,527
Of course, we are so close!

286
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,162
- So Min and I are close. - They are the national siblings.

287
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:13,549
- Listen. - Jong Kook.

288
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,449
- Use your body. Just untie that. - How should we do this?

289
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,762
- How do we untie this? - Like this?

290
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,148
Can you even untie that?

291
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,319
- This... - Do whatever it takes.

292
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,419
- Get ready. - Ready.

293
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,388
- Ready. - We can do this. Hold still.

294
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,258
- So Min, stay still. - You should just complete this.

295
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,589
Crouch down. Crouch.

296
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,689
(Did he figure out a way to solve this?)

297
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,770
Will that work?

298
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:31,728
I guess it works.

299
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,069
(He turns around and sits down.)

300
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,169
(And So Min will lift her hands with her wrists tied to the ropes.)

301
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,138
(It looks like he's going to succeed.)

302
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,738
(Will the first pair be able to accomplish the mission in one-go?)

303
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,469
(Will the first pair be able to accomplish the mission in one-go?)

304
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,978
(As if!)

305
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,179
Hold on. Wait. Hold on.

306
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,220
It didn't work.

307
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,092
- Hey, Flirty Kook. - Go inside there.

308
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,461
Hold on. Wait a second, So Min.

309
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,648
So Min. It's getting tangled up.

310
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:53,789
(As he fails at his first attempt, her reckless side takes over.)

311
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,931
So Min, you're tangling this up. Hold on a second.

312
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,106
- Only one person should move. - Wait.

313
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,628
(The ropes are even more entangled.)

314
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:01,488
- Hey, So Min. Hold on. - It's more entangled.

315
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:02,702
What is this?

316
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,998
This will never work, right?

317
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,544
How should we solve this? Wait.

318
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,320
- Wait. Don't move. - How should we solve this?

319
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,069
This...

320
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,555
- I figured it out. - Really?

321
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,284
- You got it? - Let's do your method next.

322
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,839
- Hey, tell us. - I'm right below Mensa.

323
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,990
That's just the ground.

324
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,908
- The ground is below Mensa. - Hey.

325
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:20,324
- It's just ground. - You little brat.

326
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,049
- There's the ground below Mensa. - In the end...

327
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,766
I'm right below Mensa.

328
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,819
It won't work, right?

329
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,849
(They are still thinking it over.)

330
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,449
- Put it in there. - You should go this way.

331
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,459
- Go inside the yellow ropes. - Did you go inside here?

332
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,459
Yes, jump over the rope.

333
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,559
- Isn't that mine? - Yes, come inside the ropes.

334
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,449
- I'll go in there. - Aren't these yours and mine?

335
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:36,189
You got it.

336
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,799
That's it. You just need to lift it up.

337
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,375
Lift it and take out your legs.

338
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,618
- Lift it and pull it back. - You got it.

339
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,081
No, it's the same thing.

340
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:45,299
(The ropes aren't separated.)

341
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,309
- That didn't work. - I thought it was going to work.

342
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,784
Gosh, I thought it would work.

343
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:51,179
- Is this even possible? Is it? - I thought it would work.

344
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,709
- That's fascinating. - We can try it with these.

345
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,710
The guy with the anger management issue and I will try this next.

346
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,740
My IQ is 138.

347
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,111
We'll complete this mission.

348
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:01,919
- We'll have a vote then. - Yes.

349
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,404
- Right, right. - That's neat.

350
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,432
I'll make this happen.

351
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:09,028
(I'll eliminate him. Did you all get that?)

352
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,959
He heard it. I think he heard it.

353
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,495
- No, no. - I could see what you were saying.

354
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,868
Jong Kook. Jong Kook.

355
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:16,539
- Flirty Kook. - Okay.

356
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,853
- I'll let him survive. - Okay!

357
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,413
- Flirty Kook. - Here we go. Get ready.

358
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:20,879
Start.

359
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:23,190
Hold on, Seok Jin.

360
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:25,939
Should you do the dance move from "Come Back Home"?

361
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,364
- Right. I thought that too. - You know?

362
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,608
Kwang Soo, go like this.

363
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:29,862
Go through like this.

364
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,349
Jae Seok, shouldn't you do the move from "Come Back Home"?

365
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,118
(Well, as for the dance move from "Come Back Home"...)

366
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,349
(Seo Taiji and Boys made kids who left home return home...)

367
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,658
(with their legendary song, "Come Back Home".)

368
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:42,329
(A body passing through the circle made with arms is the key point.)

369
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,714
(They'll reenact the dance on the ground.)

370
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:46,143
- You got it. - Hold on.

371
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:47,398
Seok Jin, hold on.

372
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,510
- Stay there. - Okay.

373
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,699
(Will they be able to succeed with the move from the song?)

374
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,426
(Chuckling)

375
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,309
(Untying)

376
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,439
We can't use our hands.

377
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,429
My role model is cheating again.

378
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:01,108
Can you actually separate that?

379
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:02,579
(This is the cheating of a man with a 138-IQ.)

380
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,134
- It's not working. - We have to go in there together.

381
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,036
- Yes, you must go inside like that. - Put your leg in first.

382
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,018
(Seok Jin pulls up Jae Seok's jacket.)

383
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:11,689
(Jae Seok gets back at him by pulling up the rope.)

384
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,728
(It's pulling up the ropes, a new ssireum technique.)

385
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:17,358
(All of a sudden, it becomes a ssireum match.)

386
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,612
This isn't ssireum.

387
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,329
- Why are they fighting? - Hey.

388
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,147
- Why are you two fighting? - That's not how you do it.

389
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,649
We don't have much time left.

390
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,114
- Think about the ballots. - Hold on, Seok Jin.

391
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,539
- Jae Seok, the ballots. - I'll go like this.

392
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,669
Yes, the ballots.

393
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,008
(He comes to his senses.)

394
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,222
- That's the same thing. - Come in.

395
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,794
- Did it work? - I think it worked.

396
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,809
- It worked. - They can get out of it.

397
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,949
- Come inside. - You just need to pull it up.

398
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,549
- Pull it above your head. - This is it.

399
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,579
- Really? - Let go.

400
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,919
- We got it. - I think we got it.

401
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,666
- We'll pull it up. - Hold on.

402
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:42,789
- Pull it up. - It worked?

403
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,988
(Can they accomplish their mission?)

404
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:47,454
(No way. They fail just like Jong Kook and So Min.)

405
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,228
(This guy with IQ of 138 have an impeccable memory.)

406
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,059
Hey, this is crazy. I'm so angry.

407
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,228
This won't work.

408
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:54,469
(The Seoks fail to complete the mission.)

409
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,128
- This is driving me crazy. - Hey.

410
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,669
- This is driving me crazy. - I'm so angry.

411
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,255
Hey, this won't work.

412
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,738
- Okay, you got it. - Kwang Soo.

413
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:01,839
- You should separate the ropes. - We should...

414
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,579
- We'll go this way. - We'll start.

415
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,196
(They have a realization at the same time.)

416
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,608
(Wait, something just happened.)

417
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,822
- Didn't it just come off? - Yes, it did.

418
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,179
- How? - How?

419
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,664
- This is amazing. Look. - How?

420
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,162
- How? - Look.

421
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,632
- It just came off. - Ready.

422
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,719
(Their last challenge starts.)

423
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,254
(How are they going to solve this?)

424
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,089
(Did they start a way to solve it?)

425
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,599
To that side?

426
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,922
(8 ballots are at stake on this challenge.)

427
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,868
(Wait...)

428
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,469
(Kwang Soo says hello to Se Chan's bottom up close.)

429
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,611
It got stuck.

430
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,638
(Is this your first bottom massage?)

431
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,680
Hold on.

432
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,079
(I knew it.)

433
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,261
(There's no way they'd succeed.)

434
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,108
- That's wrong. - That's not it.

435
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,478
The thing is that...

436
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:43,994
You must try a method we didn't try.

437
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,248
(Bursting into laughter)

438
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,289
(He aims his bottom right on his face.)

439
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,511
Kwang Soo, put your leg in.

440
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,970
- Put your leg in. - Okay.

441
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,858
I don't think this is possible.

442
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,728
- You should think. - It's unbelievable that it works.

443
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,398
- I can't believe it works. - I don't think that's the method.

444
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,612
Why don't you lie down on this side?

445
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,112
- Lie down here? - Yes.

446
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:02,498
- Lie down this side. - Okay.

447
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:03,682
All right. Hold this.

448
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,692
(What are they doing?)

449
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,439
(The Dumb and Dumber unite.)

450
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,738
(Rolling)

451
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:16,245
(This is not that kind of game. It's turning out to be weird.)

452
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,140
- What is this? - What are you doing?

453
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:20,748
It won't work with that method.

454
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,919
You still got that part.

455
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,181
(The Dumb and Dumber fails the mission.)

456
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,118
- It won't work. - It won't work.

457
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,128
How could you do this?

458
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,745
- No one could do this. - You try it.

459
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,459
- This is impossible. - You do it.

460
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,540
- All right. - You should try it.

461
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,728
- How could you do this? - This really works?

462
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:35,768
Does This work?

463
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,368
- Do it fair and square. - How could this work?

464
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,481
- How could this work? - How could you do this?

465
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,030
- If it's simple, I'll be mad. - I'll be annoyed.

466
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,281
- Do it slowly. - Slowly.

467
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,079
Look. The ropes were tied like this.

468
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,150
- Okay. - Here it goes.

469
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,248
- He's tying it. - How?

470
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,248
(Move closer to one another.)

471
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,349
- How? - My goodness.

472
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,278
(Make a loop with one hand.)

473
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,018
(Put the loop into the partner's rope on the wrist.)

474
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,248
(The loop inside the rope is the key point.)

475
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:58,613
I did think about using the wrist.

476
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,158
(Put the loop around the partner's wrist.)

477
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,258
What do you do after that?

478
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:04,118
(Put the loop around the partner's wrist.)

479
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,929
I didn't think about it in detail.

480
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,998
He put it inside there.

481
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:12,242
(Then you have separated the ropes like this. Ta-da!)

482
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:13,669
(The ropes are separated like magic.)

483
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,659
- Wait. Hold on. - How did that happen? Wait?

484
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,908
- I can't believe this. - Is he a magician?

485
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,108
(They can't believe it even after watching it.)

486
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,478
- Aren't you Lee Eun Gyeol? - What is this?

487
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,579
What is this? Where is it?

488
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,049
- I can't believe this. - What's happening?

489
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,737
You failed to complete your mission.

490
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,969
You will only receive...

491
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,089
- seven ballots. - Okay.

492
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,419
(1 ballot is taken away for failing the mission.)

493
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,287
Everyone, there are seven ballots among these,

494
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,488
- Is there a dud? - and one empty, dud ballot.

495
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:37,799
- Okay. - I should go for that.

496
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,972
Jae Seok has to pick it.

497
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:42,128
I'll spread them, so you can't see them.

498
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:43,128
You may all pick one.

499
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:44,180
Okay.

500
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,669
- Seok Jin. - Okay.

501
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,265
(Which member won't be able to vote regarding eliminating Jong Kook?)

502
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,899
All right. You'll reveal it one at a time.

503
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
- Here I go. 1, 2, 3. - 3.

504
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,579
Okay.

505
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,791
- You got the ballot. - I got the ballot.

506
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,289
She got the ballot too.

507
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,130
She got the ballot too.

508
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,500
- 1, 2, 3. - This is driving me crazy.

509
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,589
(Will he be able to vote for his elimination too?)

510
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,953
- He got the ballot too. - Okay!

511
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,229
That's interesting.

512
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,259
Oh, no.

513
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,410
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

514
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:13,628
(Se Chan obtains a ballot.)

515
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:15,569
- It's driving me insane. - That's strange.

516
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,069
How could this happen?

517
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,715
- It's Kwang Soo. - It's really not me.

518
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,325
It's interesting.

519
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,438
- Shall we show it together? - One.

520
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,708
- All 3 of us? - 3 of us.

521
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,208
- 3 of us. - 1, 2.

522
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,724
(3 unlucky members reveal the result together.)

523
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,479
(Among competitively unlucky members,)

524
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,378
(who will be the unluckiest one?)

525
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:32,448
- 3. - 3.

526
00:17:32,449 --> 00:17:33,789
(Seok Jin obtains a ballot.)

527
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,830
(Jae Seok obtains a ballot.)

528
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,503
That's strange.

529
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,506
What's going on?

530
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:43,221
(Kwang Soo is always unlucky.)

531
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,755
- Goodness. - Incredible. How's it possible?

532
00:17:46,969 --> 00:17:49,198
- Kwang Soo. - Did you plan this?

533
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,438
(Misfortune for unlucky Kwang Soo)

534
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:52,893
- It's strange. - Kwang Soo. What's wrong with you?

535
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,739
- It's unbelievable. - You should go somewhere.

536
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,638
There's no way.

537
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:00,448
What's the probability that he's always unlucky?

538
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:02,298
(Kwang Soo is excluded from voting.)

539
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,178
You will go to each of your spots.

540
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,069
- Then you'll vote in private. - Okay.

541
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,907
It's confusing.

542
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,958
(If most of them agree to eliminate Jong Kook)

543
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,458
- This is... - So Min.

544
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,858
You should think carefully.

545
00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:16,102
I won't vote yes.

546
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,724
I got closer to Jong Kook, so I won't do it.

547
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,727
I can't eliminate Jong Kook. Otherwise, I'll be eliminated.

548
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:22,909
I won't either.

549
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,769
Kwang Soo doesn't have a ballot.

550
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,527
I might not be eliminated.

551
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,739
(There are a few whom he can trust.)

552
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,507
So Min and I became closer.

553
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,221
Jong Kook.

554
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,648
Do you trust me?

555
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,377
Of course. I already told them.

556
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,888
(Jong Kook survives if the votes are less than the majority.)

557
00:18:40,889 --> 00:18:42,809
No, no.

558
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,030
No.

559
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,319
No.

560
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,489
(What will happen to Jong Kook?)

561
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,540
Never.

562
00:18:48,659 --> 00:18:51,599
(All 7 members finish voting.)

563
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,358
- Did everyone vote? - Yes.

564
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,097
(It's time to announce the result of the vote.)

565
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,099
(Looking around)

566
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,908
I can't let Jong Kook go like this.

567
00:19:00,909 --> 00:19:04,009
(He speaks insincerely.)

568
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,509
(All of a sudden?)

569
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,708
- All of a sudden? - Really?

570
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,349
- I agree. - Are you being honest?

571
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,370
If you didn't agree to eliminate Jong Kook,

572
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:13,235
just eliminate me next time.

573
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,289
(Recoiling)

574
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,549
Please calm down.

575
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,943
I thought you were acting.

576
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,976
- What are you doing? - He's acting.

577
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,695
Here's the result of voting whether to eliminate Jong Kook.

578
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,271
I'll be fine.

579
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,069
- I won't be eliminated. - Those who agreed.

580
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,539
(Those who agreed to eliminate Jong Kook)

581
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,069
- Five votes. - Goodness.

582
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,080
Five votes?

583
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,468
(5 out of 7 members agreed to eliminate Jong Kook.)

584
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:38,608
- You're not even human. - Five votes?

585
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:39,678
- That's harsh. - That's harsh.

586
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,599
You aren't even human.

587
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,618
(Those who agreed aren't human.)

588
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:44,932
I didn't even vote.

589
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,118
- I didn't vote. - You didn't?

590
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,618
- No. - Really?

591
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:49,948
- He didn't. - My gosh.

592
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:50,989
- Five votes? - I didn't vote.

593
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,101
Five votes?

594
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,128
Two members disagreed, but the majority agreed.

595
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,458
Jong Kook is eliminated.

596
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,651
How can we send Jong Kook away like this?

597
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,599
Wait, then two people voted against it.

598
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,468
Jong Kook voted against it, didn't he?

599
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,509
- Everyone agreed except 1. - Except 1?

600
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,339
Everyone agreed except one person.

601
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,539
- I knew it. - Haha is scary.

602
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,079
- Wait. - What's this?

603
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,524
(At that time)

604
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:17,918
(The honeybee puppet appears.)

605
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,536
- He'll be eliminated. - Am I eliminated?

606
00:20:20,449 --> 00:20:22,118
(Am I really eliminated?)

607
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:24,388
- Come on. - Wait, honeybee.

608
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,458
- Jong Kook. - No way.

609
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,408
- Don't go, don't go. - No.

610
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,259
- No, Jong Kook. - Don't go!

611
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,799
(No, Jong Kook.)

612
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,890
(Far away)

613
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,999
It's a party.

614
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,799
(It's a party.)

615
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,968
It's a party.

616
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:41,608
- This is scary. - It's a party.

617
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:44,942
(They're extremely excited.)

618
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:47,197
How could they?

619
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,660
They're so happy.

620
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,519
Is he eliminated immediately?

621
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,630
It's unbelievable.

622
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:57,124
The target candidate to be eliminated...

623
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,904
based on the first vote.

624
00:20:59,219 --> 00:21:01,059
It's six members except for Haha.

625
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,948
That's right.

626
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,529
(In other words)

627
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,035
He'll be eliminated anyway.

628
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:12,638
(Haha is the only one who voted against it.)

629
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:13,769
I must survive.

630
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,868
(He predicted that Jong Kook would be eliminated.)

631
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:18,607
- He's so sly. - He is.

632
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:21,072
Goodness. Look at him.

633
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,878
(The other 6 members are targets for elimination.)

634
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,970
- How could it be? - What's wrong?

635
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,589
- Hey, we got a text message. - We got a text message?

636
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,802
What is it?

637
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,918
It's from the honeybee again.

638
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,676
(It's a message from the honeybee.)

639
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,559
(The second judgment will start.)

640
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,620
There are two target candidates this time.

641
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,128
(Two target candidates?)

642
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:45,699
During one hour, meet celebrity friends.

643
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,395
Get them to vote one of the targets to be eliminated.

644
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,390
"Celebrity friends"?

645
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,524
"Meet celebrity friends"?

646
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,618
Based on the result, the member with more votes will be eliminated.

647
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,000
Here are the two target candidates for elimination.

648
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,458
(Who are the two target candidates that the honeybee chose?)

649
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,958
They're Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

650
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,658
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo)

651
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:11,729
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo are the second targets.)

652
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,073
- Why? - Why?

653
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,229
- Why? - What's going on?

654
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,341
(Why is it two?)

655
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,339
Wait, I can't understand the honeybee.

656
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,438
Is one of us the honeybee?

657
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,561
- I didn't think about the honeybee. - It's impossible to know.

658
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,009
Who's the honeybee?

659
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,091
Honeybee?

660
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,408
- Is it Jong Kook? - That's possible.

661
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:29,849
- It could be Jong Kook. - It could be Jong Kook.

662
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,279
(Jong Kook is taken by honeybee puppets.)

663
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,965
(Is Jong Kook behind everything?)

664
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:40,908
Jong Kook could be the honeybee, right?

665
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:44,190
Five members excluding Seok Jin and Ji Hyo.

666
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,835
You will support the candidate whom you think...

667
00:22:47,869 --> 00:22:49,516
won't be eliminated.

668
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:51,454
The one you don't think will be eliminated?

669
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,558
- Who won't likely be eliminated? - Right.

670
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,184
Who's eliminated is based on your friends' votes.

671
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,007
Those who supported the candidate who doesn't get eliminated...

672
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,674
will obtain an important hint regarding the honeybee.

673
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,279
Do you mean that...

674
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,618
our friends will determine who should be eliminated?

675
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,792
- That's correct. - Okay.

676
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,049
(There's only one way.)

677
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,618
Do we stand behind the candidate who won't likely be eliminated?

678
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:14,014
(Everyone gathers around Ji Hyo.)

679
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:15,858
It's pointless to say anything.

680
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:17,928
(Empty and crowded)

681
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:18,958
I think it's over.

682
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,484
I'd be surprised if anyone came to me.

683
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
It'll be unbelievable.

684
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:23,960
Teams are determined.

685
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,884
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E441 Running Man</font>

686
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,239
(Goodness)

687
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,321
Come on.

688
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,183
(The difference is extreme.)

689
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,678
Don't you know?

690
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,749
- It was obvious. - Do you have no friends?

691
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,579
- The answer was clear. - It was obvious.

692
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,349
- What do you mean? - You have something.

693
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,218
They're bad at predicting.

694
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:46,589
- If Seok Jin survives, - Only me?

695
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,115
- Seok Jin will... - That won't happen.

696
00:23:49,459 --> 00:23:52,999
Even if Seok Jin gets the hint, he won't understand it.

697
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,198
(He won't understand the hint.)

698
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:56,928
(His lonely fight against 6 starts.)

699
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,324
What? I'm going to hit you.

700
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,789
- You have one hour. - All right.

701
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,703
He'll come within 30 minutes.

702
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,408
(This person will have time.)

703
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:08,794
That's true.

704
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,178
Can we meet around 2:40pm?

705
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,378
(They start to invite friends.)

706
00:24:13,379 --> 00:24:15,549
(The one who gets more votes is eliminated.)

707
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,035
You just need to vote.

708
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,431
We'll stop by.

709
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,989
- Do we go right away? - We should go.

710
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,453
(After difficulties of inviting them, they go to meet them.)

711
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,099
Seok Jin got caught in an extreme case.

712
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,110
Right.

713
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,928
Seok Jin versus Jae Seok.

714
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,599
- It's confusing. - It's really confusing.

715
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,398
There's nothing confusing about it.

716
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:33,809
Today was especially confusing.

717
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,435
Come on, there's nothing confusing about it.

718
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,353
It shouldn't be confusing.

719
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:40,239
I'm pure and innocent.

720
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,390
It's too much.

721
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,840
(He verbally attacks him in a way that makes sense.)

722
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,388
- Right. - It's too much.

723
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,089
It's always too much.

724
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,402
You deserve some beating.

725
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,447
- He does. - You've been saying that for years.

726
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:55,688
- Seok Jin, what's wrong? - I never hit anyone,

727
00:24:55,689 --> 00:24:57,881
but I hit very hard. It's like a bee sting.

728
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,499
(A bee sting?)

729
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,499
- What did you say? - A bee sting.

730
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,529
- It's like medicine. - Seok Jin.

731
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,329
Are you the honeybee?

732
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,652
Wait, are you the honeybee?

733
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:05,999
Is it Seok Jin?

734
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,293
- I sting like a bee. - Are you the honeybee?

735
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,183
It was strange, wasn't it?

736
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,438
- I'm telling you that it's not me. - Why not?

737
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,979
- Tell us. - I'm a honeybee. What?

738
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,423
(Surprised)

739
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,819
- I'm a honeybee. - Are you a honeybee?

740
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,093
"I'm a honeybee."

741
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:22,643
- What do you mean? - Are you a honeybee?

742
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,918
"I'm a honeybee"?

743
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,112
- "I'm a honeybee"? - Don't tell us that.

744
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,259
Is today's shoot ruined?

745
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,471
I'm not.

746
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,193
- This isn't fun for us. - What's going on?

747
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,499
I'm not the honeybee.

748
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,099
- "I'm a honeybee." You said that. - You said that you are.

749
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,739
I think it's possible that Jong Kook and Seok Jin are...

750
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,023
the honeybees.

751
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,451
Is it not one person?

752
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,378
(Jong Kook is eliminated as the shoot starts.)

753
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,108
(Is honeybee Jong Kook behind it all?)

754
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:51,779
(Seok Jin says that he's a honeybee.)

755
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,537
(Did Seok Jin say it by mistake?)

756
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,618
- Is it not one person? - It's possible.

757
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,761
Sir.

758
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,519
(Speaking of which)

759
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,829
(The voice was low in the first video.)

760
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,229
(The voice was higher in the next one.)

761
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,875
I should listen to it again.

762
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,499
It's a woman.

763
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,762
(The second honeybee is a woman.)

764
00:26:11,969 --> 00:26:14,039
(Is the second honeybee either So Min or Ji Hyo?)

765
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,708
I think it's a woman.

766
00:26:15,709 --> 00:26:17,138
Is it Ji Hyo?

767
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,149
Me?

768
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,839
It's not me.

769
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,769
- Really? - It's not me.

770
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,979
(Ji Hyo denies it. Could it be...)

771
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,990
Me?

772
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,511
Me? It's not me.

773
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,524
(Candidates start to increase. Who is the honeybee?)

774
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,089
We must be here. We're here.

775
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,342
(They arrive at his house.)

776
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,313
Let's get ready to welcome him.

777
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,828
Let's toss him in the air when he comes out.

778
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,468
How many friends would come out...

779
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,438
- when you call them so suddenly? - Seriously.

780
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,722
That is true.

781
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:49,168
(He's here.)

782
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:50,179
- Goodness. - Where?

783
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,391
(Everyone is happy to see the one who appears.)

784
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,049
(Who is the important guest with a ballot?)

785
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,160
Hello.

786
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,479
Hello.

787
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,701
Come.

788
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,677
(It's comedian Nam Chang Hee.)

789
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,418
(He hasn't been on Running Man for 3 years.)

790
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,658
(He participated in the 1st Unlucky Festival.)

791
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:10,529
(He returns as a lucky guest to pick the second target.)

792
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,428
Come out first.

793
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:14,299
- Chang Hee. - Slowly.

794
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,188
- All right. - Slowly, 2, 3.

795
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,668
- Welcome. - Welcome.

796
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,628
- 1, 2, 3. - Welcome.

797
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,638
It's Nam Chang Hee.

798
00:27:22,639 --> 00:27:23,638
(Thank you so much.)

799
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,678
- Chang Hee. - We're proud of you.

800
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:27,279
- Hello, Chang Hee. - Hello.

801
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,563
It's over...

802
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:30,779
- Hello. - from the look on his face.

803
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,203
You came on the show after a long time.

804
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:35,418
Please say hello to viewers of Running Man.

805
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,888
Hello, I was on Running Man's...

806
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,958
special for unlucky people.

807
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,388
- That's right. - Right.

808
00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:43,628
- That's right. Thank you. - I'm back for the second time.

809
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:46,862
- You have a pimple on your face. - Is that important?

810
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,529
- Yes. - Did you have to mention it?

811
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,168
(What are you doing to a precious voter?)

812
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,269
As a celebrity, you should take good care of yourself.

813
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,339
It can't be helped because you're born with your skin.

814
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,938
- Yes, I understand. - You know that.

815
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,009
- You're born with talking skills. - That's right.

816
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,979
I didn't get such genes from my parents.

817
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,464
(He wasn't born with talking skills.)

818
00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:04,718
I wasn't born with talking skills.

819
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,265
- Chang Hee. - I was born this way.

820
00:28:06,379 --> 00:28:07,948
What's wrong with you?

821
00:28:07,949 --> 00:28:10,646
We don't have much time.

822
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,989
The person whom you vote for...

823
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,413
will be eliminated soon.

824
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,780
You'll play a very important role.

825
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,499
That's such an intimidating role.

826
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,299
I know, but we don't have much time.

827
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,501
They should appeal to Chang Hee since he'll be voting.

828
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:28,061
Appeal to him? That's so old-fashioned.

829
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,079
- I prepared an acrostic poem. - That sounds good.

830
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,678
(Ji Hyo makes an acrostic poem with "Nam Chang Hee".)

831
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:34,378
- With my name? - "Nam".

832
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,309
("Nam")

833
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,067
Others won't know.

834
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,371
- "Chang". - Chang Hee's charms.

835
00:28:41,189 --> 00:28:44,888
(What are my charms, Ji Hyo?)

836
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,899
- "Hee". - "Hee".

837
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:47,849
(Laughing)

838
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,858
(He falls for her laughter.)

839
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,928
- Seriously. - Chang Hee is happy.

840
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,516
I've never seen him smile like that.

841
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,295
- That's his sincere smile. - Ji Hyo did a good job.

842
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,739
(Laughing)

843
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,981
(He fell for her.)

844
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,893
(You won't vote for me, right?)

845
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,020
What's that?

846
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:08,201
- She thought of him. - He likes it.

847
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,974
Chang Hee, we don't have much time.

848
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,688
- Please vote one of them. - All right.

849
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:17,013
- Please vote over there. - It's his show today.

850
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,158
Chang Hee.

851
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,489
- Chang Hee. - We don't know who he'll choose.

852
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,974
- He might create a twist. - Chang Hee.

853
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:26,074
(Which one did Chang Hee vote?)

854
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:27,668
Chang Hee.

855
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,468
Thank you so much for coming on the show so suddenly.

856
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,938
- Goodbye. - I'll get going.

857
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,468
- Bye. - Good luck, Running Man.

858
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:35,908
- Thank you, Chang Hee. - Have a good day.

859
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,979
- You can do it. - Director Lee Chang Dong.

860
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,253
- Director Lee Chang Dong? - Yes.

861
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:44,019
(Director Lee Chang Dong makes a special appearance.)

862
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,688
(When did the director arrive?)

863
00:29:47,689 --> 00:29:49,003
There he is.

864
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,358
- There he is. - I see what it is.

865
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,006
- Goodbye. - He looked exactly the same.

866
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:55,329
- My gosh. - Bye.

867
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,975
- See you. - See you, Chang Hee.

868
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,299
- Bye, Chang Hee. - Bye.

869
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,501
Jong Kook didn't do much after being eliminated first.

870
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:05,067
Do people take turns being the honeybee after being eliminated?

871
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,165
He could be watching us from the monitoring room.

872
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,579
- That's true. - He got eliminated too soon.

873
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,448
Did Jong Kook pick me and Ji Hyo?

874
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:16,249
- I know. - Right.

875
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,270
Is everyone who's eliminated the honeybee?

876
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:21,188
- I know. - He got eliminated too early.

877
00:30:21,189 --> 00:30:23,118
You have 25 minutes left.

878
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,059
- Is that so? - Will you meet one more?

879
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,312
It's not easy to meet a celebrity.

880
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,358
People might be in Sangam-dong at this hour.

881
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,552
- That comedy rehearsal room? - There are many right now.

882
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:36,468
Let's pick someone who passes by the comedy rehearsal room.

883
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:37,468
The one who's about to enter.

884
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,099
- Shall we go there? - Let's go.

885
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,509
(They go to a comedy rehearsal room in Sangam-dong.)

886
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,863
There could be bees other than the honeybee.

887
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,151
- Right. - Right?

888
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,809
(They arrive at the rehearsal room in Sangam-dong.)

889
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,425
- Are we here? - We're here.

890
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,878
Where are you, Je Seong?

891
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,178
(He calls Je Seong.)

892
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:54,643
Are you shooting? Where are you? Are you in Sangam-dong?

893
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,031
Okay. Come soon.

894
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,240
- That's good. - We have many ballots.

895
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,289
- Seok Jin, you have an advantage. - It's possible.

896
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,458
That's true.

897
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:06,136
We're meeting comedians who are his colleagues.

898
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:07,698
It's Bo Young.

899
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,184
(It's Bo Young.)

900
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,799
(Is it Park Bo Young whom we know?)

901
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,315
- It's Bo Young. - Really?

902
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,069
Park Bo Young?

903
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,887
(Park Bo Young?)

904
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,068
(She appeared on 4 episodes of Running Man.)

905
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,500
(Park Bo Young is a cute and lively actress.)

906
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,065
(Is Park Bo Young really here?)

907
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,186
(Actress Park Bo Young is really here.)

908
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,829
Is everyone inside? I'll say hello.

909
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,405
- Bo Young. - Hello.

910
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,229
- Goodness. - Bo Young.

911
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,755
- Hello. - What brings you here?

912
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,569
I'm about to go in.

913
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,580
Really?

914
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,299
- Long time no see. - You still look pretty.

915
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,809
It's been a long time, Bo Young.

916
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,608
Hello, hello.

917
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,279
Where were you going?

918
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,703
- It's so embarrassing. - Why?

919
00:31:53,939 --> 00:31:56,279
(I have no makeup on.)

920
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,693
- I don't know. - By the way,

921
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,819
- today... - Aren't you wearing makeup?

922
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,819
- She isn't wearing makeup. - Is it true?

923
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,148
- You still look pretty. - You look pretty without makeup.

924
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:06,188
I'm sorry, Bo Young. It was so sudden.

925
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:07,989
No, it's me who's sorry.

926
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,747
More than anything,

927
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,698
she's like family to us on Running Man.

928
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:13,898
She's family indeed.

929
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,799
- It's been such a long time. - That's right.

930
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,398
You should come to the show.

931
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:19,799
- It's because... - I'm enjoying the show.

932
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,309
Bo Young was on the show when it started.

933
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,309
- She worked so hard. - She really did.

934
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,579
We were running so much back then.

935
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,579
As you know, Bo Young joined us at our company dinner.

936
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,922
That's right.

937
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,049
- Right. - Seriously.

938
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,549
She's quite close to Kwang Soo.

939
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,589
- We're close. - Do you call each other often?

940
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,358
- Yes. - We're like family.

941
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,888
- Really? - Your fathers are...

942
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:42,789
- also close. - They're close.

943
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,658
Are you going to a meeting for a drama?

944
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,559
I have a meeting with the director and the writer.

945
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,317
She was passing by chance.

946
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:52,438
As we were shooting, she wanted to say hello.

947
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,984
- Is that so? - It's good to see you.

948
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,368
Are you really not wearing any makeup?

949
00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:57,509
(It's unbelievable.)

950
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,638
- I'm hardly wearing any. - Hardly.

951
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:00,993
(This is my natural look.)

952
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,049
It's the director.

953
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,402
- Is the director here? - That's the director.

954
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,849
- Hello. - Hello.

955
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,118
It's the director of her drama.

956
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,907
I'll be right there.

957
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,231
Please cast Kwang Soo.

958
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,259
(He's a good actor.)

959
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,759
He's a good actor.

960
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,729
- He's not a comedian. Cast him. - Stop it.

961
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,698
- What? - The director told us.

962
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:19,958
- What did he say? - "I'm sorry."

963
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,299
What do you mean?

964
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,529
(He leaves quickly. You're mistaken.)

965
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,668
- When did he say that? - He came by.

966
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:27,569
- What? - He said "I'm sorry."

967
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,397
- I saw him. I definitely saw him. - Right?

968
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:33,678
We can't ask Bo Young to be with us for a long time.

969
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,579
We're voting right now.

970
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:39,079
Either Seok Jin and Ji Hyo...

971
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,648
- has to be eliminated. - Me and him.

972
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:44,559
- The one whom I vote? - Yes.

973
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,489
I'll interview you briefly.

974
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,752
What does Seok Jin mean to you?

975
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,547
- Be honest. - It's a general question.

976
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:52,658
(Bo Young has never thought of such a question.)

977
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:56,368
(He's a comedian with whom she tackled a few times.)

978
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:59,668
I watched the show so many times.

979
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:02,309
- What does he mean to you? - I think of him as big-nosed.

980
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,069
(I think of him as big-nosed.)

981
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,339
To you? That's the best compliment.

982
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,399
- Seriously. - It's the best compliment.

983
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,598
Thank you.

984
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:13,403
It's the best compliment. What does Ji Hyo mean to you?

985
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,149
Ji Hyo was so warm-hearted to me.

986
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,079
It's already over.

987
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,829
When I was on the show for the first time,

988
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,959
- I was on the same team with her. - That's right.

989
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,758
- I can't forget that she hugged me. - Right.

990
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:27,911
(I can't forget that she hugged me warmly.)

991
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:33,483
(Ji Hyo gave her a helpful tip for the race.)

992
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,678
(She gave Bo Young a warm hug to comfort her when she was scared.)

993
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,238
(It's still clear in my memory.)

994
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,572
Bo Young, that's really nice,

995
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,678
- but what does she mean? - I'm sorry.

996
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,678
(Wait a minute.)

997
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,379
(Summarize it in one word.)

998
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,689
That was too long. Please make it short.

999
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,942
- Okay. - What does Seok Jin mean to you?

1000
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,528
- He's big-nosed. - Big-nosed.

1001
00:34:54,529 --> 00:34:57,028
- What does Ji Hyo mean to you? - She's like my sister.

1002
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,298
(Ji Hyo is like my sister.)

1003
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:59,829
(Big-nosed versus sister)

1004
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,428
He's in trouble.

1005
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:03,999
- It's over. - He's in trouble.

1006
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,068
- No. - Is voting necessary?

1007
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:08,089
What does Kwang Soo mean to you?

1008
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:11,908
(He asks her a bonus question about Kwang Soo.)

1009
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:16,749
(Kwang Soo considers her his family. What does she think of him?)

1010
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,778
He's a giraffe.

1011
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:18,961
(Curt)

1012
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,048
(To Bo Young, Kwang Soo is just a giraffe.)

1013
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,789
- I see. - What?

1014
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,059
I thought it'd be a brother, but I was wrong.

1015
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,388
- What? - What was that?

1016
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:30,218
To you, Kwang Soo is a giraffe.

1017
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,076
Bo Young, please vote.

1018
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,669
Seok Jin, do you have something to say to her?

1019
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,698
- Say something short. - Something short.

1020
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,234
You're always pretty and beautiful.

1021
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,528
Your charms are pure and innocent.

1022
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,039
- You are... - Thank you.

1023
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,838
Was it quite uncomfortable?

1024
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:46,008
(She interrupts him.)

1025
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,508
(Was his appeal uncomfortable?)

1026
00:35:47,509 --> 00:35:49,379
I never saw Bo Young step back.

1027
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,349
- Why are you going back? - She kept stepping back.

1028
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,218
She interrupted him.

1029
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:56,289
Even I thought it was fake.

1030
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,859
I thought it was a scene from a movie...

1031
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,988
- Wait. - when he complimented her.

1032
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:01,689
Goodness, what was the matter?

1033
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:02,973
Did you feel uncomfortable?

1034
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:06,059
Why? Why would you feel uncomfortable with me, my Bo Young?

1035
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,658
(He sounds cheesy.)

1036
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,468
- "My Bo Young". - "My Bo Young".

1037
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,984
I should vote soon.

1038
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,539
(I became certain thanks to Seok Jin.)

1039
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,008
- All right, please vote. - We never know.

1040
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,539
- Bo Young has a meeting to attend. - We don't know.

1041
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,638
- Right. - She has to go.

1042
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:20,979
Happy New Year.

1043
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,565
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.

1044
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,849
- Stay healthy, bye. - Thank you.

1045
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,395
Let's meet again soon.

1046
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,773
- Please come on the show. - Thank you and goodbye.

1047
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,888
Do I vote for the one who'll be eliminated?

1048
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:32,880
- It's between Seok Jin and Ji Hyo. - Right.

1049
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,289
(Seok Jin makes her a little bit uncomfortable.)

1050
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:42,499
(Ji Hyo is like her sister with an unforgettable hug.)

1051
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,999
(I'm sorry.)

1052
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,338
Happy New Year. Thank you.

1053
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:47,389
Bye, Bo Young.

1054
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,580
Have a good day.

1055
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,109
It's about a magician...

1056
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,238
There it is.

1057
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,826
- I think this is it. - This?

1058
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,249
- This is it. - It is.

1059
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,448
We don't have time. We must ask quickly.

1060
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,448
- Je Seong. - Hello, Je Seong.

1061
00:37:01,449 --> 00:37:03,118
- Je Seong. - Hello.

1062
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,614
(Comedian Hwang Je Seong)

1063
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,289
(He's a laughter zombie who makes everyone laugh.)

1064
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,198
(Today he is the last voter, who came running after one phone call.)

1065
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,829
Just make up your mind. Je Seong, come here.

1066
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,329
(Today he is the last voter, who came running after one phone call.)

1067
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,814
- Je Seong, are you freezing? - Yes.

1068
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,068
(Seok Jin tries to win his heart by lending his jacket.)

1069
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:20,238
Thank you.

1070
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,609
We're even wearing almost the same color.

1071
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,039
That's right. It's pretty.

1072
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,039
- Je Seong. - Yes?

1073
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,338
- This is what really warms you up. - Ji Hyo.

1074
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:27,678
(This is what really warms you up.)

1075
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,003
(Ji Hyo counterattacks with a hand warmer.)

1076
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:32,118
This is what really warms you up.

1077
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,649
(She gives him two hand warmers.)

1078
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,034
- Will you be okay? - I'll be okay.

1079
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,240
- Je Seong is freezing. - Sit down, Je Seong.

1080
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,218
Seok Jin, aren't you cold?

1081
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:41,451
- Aren't you cold? - You look cold.

1082
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,428
He put his hands between his legs. He's freezing.

1083
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:44,629
He's freezing.

1084
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,599
(He is the only one who is freezing.)

1085
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,899
- I'll give you back the jacket. - It's okay.

1086
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,028
- Are you sure? - I'm fine.

1087
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:50,229
The thing is,

1088
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,568
one of these two will be out...

1089
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:53,568
depending on your choice.

1090
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:54,782
Depending on your choice.

1091
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,769
- It's a vote. - Pick one.

1092
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,838
- Seriously, - Say what you think.

1093
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,152
don't think too much.

1094
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,039
- What does Seok Jin mean to you? - This is the first time...

1095
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,109
(What does Seok Jin mean to you?)

1096
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,149
What does Seok Jin mean to you?

1097
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,472
(This time, it will be different.)

1098
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,649
(I even gave him my jacket.)

1099
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,740
(I'm sure I won his heart.)

1100
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:12,818
(What does Seok Jin mean to him after receiving the jacket?)

1101
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:14,577
He means nothing more than "seok" to me.

1102
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,888
- A stone. - A stone?

1103
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:17,059
(He means nothing more than a stone.)

1104
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,698
(Seok Jin means a stone to Je Seong.)

1105
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:19,859
A stone?

1106
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,394
(Seok Jin is freezing.)

1107
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,999
Between Ji Hyo and Seok Jin...

1108
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,169
What does Ji Hyo mean to you?

1109
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,371
Ji Hyo means "hyo" to me.

1110
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,151
- A good girl. - They follow their names.

1111
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,309
- They follow their names. - What does "hyo" mean?

1112
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,379
You're on fire today.

1113
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,571
- You're incredible. - You're so funny today.

1114
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,448
You think so? I'm doing good?

1115
00:38:40,449 --> 00:38:41,749
- It's high-quality. - Okay.

1116
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,739
Seok Jin, do you want to say something to Je Seong?

1117
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,189
Je Seong...

1118
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,959
Every young comedian I have my eye on becomes popular.

1119
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,388
- Like who? - Like who?

1120
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:49,559
Who, for example?

1121
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,075
Do you have your eye on someone right now?

1122
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,214
- I do. - Who?

1123
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,198
- Je Seong, first of all. - Je Seong.

1124
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,441
- Je Seong and Na Rae. - He's smiling.

1125
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,052
Na Rae is...

1126
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,463
Seok Jin, Na Rae is the one who has her eye on you.

1127
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,838
(Only Seok Jin didn't know.)

1128
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,879
(The popular comedian, Park Na Rae, has her eye on Seok Jin.)

1129
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,274
The situation has completely reversed.

1130
00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:11,347
Je Seong is already popular too.

1131
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,276
- They're both already popular. - Who is watching who?

1132
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,267
- What does he even mean? - Who is watching who?

1133
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,349
That was funny.

1134
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,015
(So cool)

1135
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,209
Na Rae is watching me. That was funny.

1136
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,719
I haven't laughed this hard in a while.

1137
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,528
All right. Let's have a vote now.

1138
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,129
He should go back to his practice soon.

1139
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,698
You can come to me and leave the note.

1140
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,749
Je Seong.

1141
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:35,609
- This is the first time we've met. - What?

1142
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,568
- This is the first time, right? - This is the second time.

1143
00:39:37,569 --> 00:39:38,620
You don't remember, do you?

1144
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:42,074
(Seok Jin completely loses Je Seong.)

1145
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:43,994
Stop making mistakes.

1146
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,568
- Where did you meet? - "The Golden Bell Challenge".

1147
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,460
You forgot...

1148
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:50,569
It's "Star Golden Bell", you brat.

1149
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,959
I've never been on "The Golden Bell Challenge".

1150
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,100
Why do you call him a brat?

1151
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,629
- Why do you... - He could be confused.

1152
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,609
- Why... - Why do you call him a brat?

1153
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,428
Why did you say that?

1154
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,129
- I'm just being friendly. - Thank you.

1155
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,129
Thank you, Je Seong.

1156
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,241
- Je Seong. - Thank you!

1157
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:05,015
You did a good job, Je Seong.

1158
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,099
Thank you.

1159
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,738
(The vote will determine the second target.)

1160
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:10,921
But we don't know...

1161
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,563
- who Je Seong will choose yet. - You're right.

1162
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,023
Choose who should be out.

1163
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,197
- We don't know who he'll choose. - Choose who should be out.

1164
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,479
Choose who should be out.

1165
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,579
(The time is up.)

1166
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,176
(It is time to decide the second target.)

1167
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,375
The time is up.

1168
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,832
Let me announce the result.

1169
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,829
Seok Jin...

1170
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,859
(Who did Chang Hee, Bo Young, and Je Seong think should be out?)

1171
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,068
Seok Jin got three votes.

1172
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:39,269
(Seok Jin got 3 votes.)

1173
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,539
- What? - What?

1174
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,983
(It was a unanimous vote.)

1175
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:46,479
(As expected, Chang Hee voted for Seok Jin.)

1176
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,579
(Bo Young also voted for Seok Jin with an apology.)

1177
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,287
(Je Seong of course, voted for Seok Jin as well.)

1178
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,778
(Seok Jin is the second target.)

1179
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,813
(Thank you, voters.)

1180
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,300
Everyone.

1181
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,978
The second target, Seok Jin,

1182
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,798
will be out...

1183
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,143
within 30 minutes.

1184
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,240
"Within 30 minutes"?

1185
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,638
(I'm not out right away?)

1186
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:14,638
Not right away?

1187
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,881
He's out anyway.

1188
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,508
No one knows...

1189
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,278
when, where, how, and by who he will be eliminated.

1190
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:22,109
When he is out,

1191
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,049
- we'll select the next target. - Okay.

1192
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,488
If he survives for 30 minutes,

1193
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,818
he will continue to be the target.

1194
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,839
(If he survives for 30 minutes, he will continue to be the target.)

1195
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,158
(The target might not change?)

1196
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,229
You have to protect Seok Jin...

1197
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,428
to remain safe.

1198
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:41,329
- That's right. - We have to protect him.

1199
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,568
If Seok Jin...

1200
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,269
- We have to protect him. - That's right.

1201
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,838
When he is out, one of us will be the target.

1202
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,338
We don't know who will be the next target.

1203
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,724
So be careful on your way.

1204
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,401
- Let's go have some lunch. - Let's eat.

1205
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:54,295
We should be careful on our way.

1206
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,479
Someone might pop out and rip my name tag off.

1207
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,347
(Will Seok Jin survive the next 30 minutes?)

1208
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,417
(They arrive at a restaurant for possibly their last meal.)

1209
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:04,899
No one is here.

1210
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,859
(The hall is empty.)

1211
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,919
2, 4...

1212
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,879
By the way, where is Jong Kook?

1213
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,088
Is he really in prison?

1214
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:12,298
(They still don't know where Jong Kook is.)

1215
00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:13,977
Ji Hyo survived.

1216
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,993
Among Ji Hyo's supporters,

1217
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,288
only one can get a hint.

1218
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,169
- Among us? - Who wants it?

1219
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,169
- Me. - Me.

1220
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,351
- Me. - The thing is...

1221
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,458
(Me!)

1222
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:29,402
- I mean... - Ji Hyo, you pick one.

1223
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:31,833
Exclude Kwang Soo.

1224
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,678
- He gave me an order. - What did he say?

1225
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:35,749
He told me to exclude Kwang Soo.

1226
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,861
What's with him?

1227
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,588
(Exclude Kwang Soo.)

1228
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:42,185
Does he think we're rivals or something?

1229
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:43,789
- Let's... - Rock-paper-scissors?

1230
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,911
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Okay.

1231
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,729
- Kwang Soo. - Then...

1232
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,972
- You're excluded. - You're excluded.

1233
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:49,068
For no reason?

1234
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,329
- I mean... - Am I excluded?

1235
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,638
- Kwang Soo is excluded. - Kwang Soo is excluded.

1236
00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:52,851
- You're excluded. - Okay.

1237
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:55,568
(He feels hurt.)

1238
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,269
Rock-paper-scissors.

1239
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,309
(They play rock-paper-scissors without Kwang Soo.)

1240
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,209
(Jae Seok and So Min win.)

1241
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,664
- Okay. - Okay.

1242
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,692
The cheaters are out.

1243
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,268
So Min, if I cheer for you, will you show me the hint?

1244
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,948
- Of course. - Jeon So Min!

1245
00:43:08,949 --> 00:43:12,258
(They suddenly start cheering for So Min.)

1246
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,704
Jae Seok, if I cheer for you, will you show me the hint?

1247
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,729
- What? - Will you show me the hint?

1248
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:16,729
I support you.

1249
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,258
(I support you.)

1250
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:19,658
(You too?)

1251
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:20,999
- Yu Jae Seok! - Yu Jae Seok!

1252
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,399
(Go, Jae Seok!)

1253
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,338
(It suddenly turns into a cheer competition.)

1254
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,652
- Kwang Soo, Se Chan. - Yes?

1255
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,238
- Yu Jae Seok! - Yu Jae Seok!

1256
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,309
(Did you need us?)

1257
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,349
Carry me.

1258
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,649
(The other team cheers with a song.)

1259
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,548
(Will the loudest win...)

1260
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:46,488
(or the tallest?)

1261
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:48,729
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Jeon So Min!

1262
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,306
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Ready.

1263
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:51,758
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1264
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:52,829
(Which of the two will win the honeybee hint?)

1265
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,468
(Jae Seok wins.)

1266
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,269
(He will get a hint.)

1267
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,663
- Yu Jae Seok! - Yu Jae Seok!

1268
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,238
(Praise Jae Seok!)

1269
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,249
Yu Jae Seok!

1270
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:05,722
Go back to your seats.

1271
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:07,638
- Go back. - Please...

1272
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:08,749
I...

1273
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,749
- Sit down. - From the beginning...

1274
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,649
- Go back to your seats. - From the beginning,

1275
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,094
- I didn't want to see the hint. - Sit down.

1276
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,261
- Guys. - Sit down.

1277
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:18,088
(After sending everyone away, he checks the hint.)

1278
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,271
Jae Seok.

1279
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:21,129
What's this?

1280
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:25,966
(The hint says, "young".)

1281
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:27,829
- Jae Seok. - Is that the hint?

1282
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,688
Show me and Kwang Soo first.

1283
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:33,568
I can't show this to them.

1284
00:44:33,569 --> 00:44:35,560
(Jae Seok changes his mind.)

1285
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:36,880
- What? - What?

1286
00:44:37,569 --> 00:44:40,439
(I can't show this to them.)

1287
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,149
(They can't believe what they hear.)

1288
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,149
What did you say?

1289
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,479
(Hold on.)

1290
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,691
What did you say?

1291
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,749
What... What did you say?

1292
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,011
- I can't show it to you. - What...

1293
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:51,959
- What do you mean? - Seriously...

1294
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,318
Like we did before...

1295
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,388
His legs...

1296
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:56,158
(This is what you get.)

1297
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,594
(He is punished for not sharing the hint.)

1298
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,459
- You said you'd share it with us. - You said you'd share it with us.

1299
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,499
You made us carry you.

1300
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,116
What does that mean?

1301
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,957
- I don't understand the hint. - Hold on.

1302
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:09,399
How are we supposed to protect Seok Jin for 30 minutes?

1303
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,135
- His name tag... - Protect me from any threat.

1304
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,879
- I hope no one in here attacks him. - Your food is here.

1305
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,627
Is it one of us?

1306
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:17,191
Your food is here.

1307
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,318
What if someone comes in with the food?

1308
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:20,460
Be careful.

1309
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,030
Will someone...

1310
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:23,988
I think someone is in here.

1311
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:24,988
Hello.

1312
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:27,040
- No. I recognize her. - Right.

1313
00:45:27,819 --> 00:45:29,709
- Hello. - Hello.

1314
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,110
It's a salad.

1315
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,272
There is tangsuyuk too.

1316
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:36,269
What's going on?

1317
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,428
(They're served with a lot of food not as usual.)

1318
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:39,288
Will we be out if we eat this?

1319
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:40,698
(The staff doesn't usually let us eat this much food.)

1320
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:42,386
What can happen during the 30 minutes?

1321
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,929
- The time is almost up. - Nothing is happening.

1322
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:46,709
There are 11 minutes left.

1323
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:47,749
- Only 11 minutes? - What?

1324
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,600
(Surprised)

1325
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,919
(The waitress...)

1326
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,919
(suddenly goes behind Seok Jin.)

1327
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:58,780
(She approaches Seok Jin.)

1328
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,501
My goodness.

1329
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:06,158
(They watch every small movement around Seok Jin.)

1330
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:07,798
(But the waitress leaves after serving the food.)

1331
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:10,269
- It's a lot. - What can possibly happen?

1332
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,684
There are only 10 minutes left.

1333
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,798
- You guys... - Seok Jin, your microphone...

1334
00:46:13,799 --> 00:46:15,385
(The audio director suddenly barges in.)

1335
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,360
What? No!

1336
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,479
(Why did he suddenly barge in?)

1337
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,691
- Let me check the power. - No!

1338
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,668
- The power... - No!

1339
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,061
Let me just check the power.

1340
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:28,391
I mean...

1341
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:29,960
The power is suddenly off?

1342
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:32,359
It's working perfectly fine.

1343
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,682
- He checked his name tag. - He did.

1344
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:36,072
He just checked Seok Jin's name tag.

1345
00:46:36,159 --> 00:46:37,158
- But... - Really?

1346
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,298
That was pretty aggressive. I was scared.

1347
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,482
It was definitely aggressive.

1348
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,590
(Peeping)

1349
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,380
There is nothing outside.

1350
00:46:47,699 --> 00:46:48,821
Lock the door.

1351
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,590
We could just stand here for the next 10 minutes.

1352
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,039
Let's take turns.

1353
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,695
- Let's guard the door. - That sounds good.

1354
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:57,272
Let me ask you something. It's not one of you, is it?

1355
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,598
- Never. - No?

1356
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,105
I'm afraid...

1357
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,137
a dozen people will storm in.

1358
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:07,107
There are only five minutes left. It doesn't make sense.

1359
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,005
- No way. - Seriously...

1360
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:10,702
- Gosh! - What?

1361
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,430
(Another door opens.)

1362
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,876
(Jong Kook enters.)

1363
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:22,209
(What is Jong Kook doing here?)

1364
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,338
(He is back dressed as a honeybee.)

1365
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:25,451
What's going on?

1366
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,079
He is the honeybee.

1367
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,120
Come!

1368
00:47:28,409 --> 00:47:29,649
He is the honeybee.

1369
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,879
- Come! - You're the honeybee?

1370
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,218
You're the honeybee?

1371
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,866
- He is the honeybee. - Come!

1372
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:35,888
- He is here. - He is the honeybee?

1373
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:37,448
(Is Jong Kook really the honeybee?)

1374
00:47:37,449 --> 00:47:42,988
(Everyone became suspicious when he was eliminated so soon.)

1375
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:47,878
(They suspected Jong Kook was the honeybee.)

1376
00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:50,868
(Was all of this...)

1377
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:58,738
(Jong Kook's plan?)

1378
00:47:58,739 --> 00:47:59,789
Come!

1379
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,838
- Come! - No!

1380
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,435
(The honeybee's hunt starts.)

1381
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:04,908
- Come! - No!

1382
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:06,749
- Stop him! - No!

1383
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,749
Guys.

1384
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:08,919
(Helpless)

1385
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,708
- Where are you going? - Stop him! Guys, stop him!

1386
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,689
- Stop him! - Come here!

1387
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,258
(The name tag is ripped off.)

1388
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,289
(Seok Jin is out.)

1389
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,845
- What is this? - Okay.

1390
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,269
Gosh.

1391
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,350
What are you doing, guys?

1392
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,769
(Shocked)

1393
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,587
How will this make us look?

1394
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,817
- Guys. - My goodness.

1395
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,269
What is this?

1396
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:30,925
How could you not stop him?

1397
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:32,738
He stormed in so suddenly.

1398
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:34,579
I could have continued to be the target.

1399
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:35,749
We couldn't stop him.

1400
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,979
You fools! How could you not stop him?

1401
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,249
There were only five minutes left.

1402
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,947
Let's move to the final destination.

1403
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,519
In the final mission, identify the honeybee and eliminate him or her.

1404
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,712
It's called the Flight of the Honeybee.

1405
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:52,829
- But we don't know anything. - You have a hint.

1406
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,445
I don't know what it means.

1407
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,540
I'm serious.

1408
00:48:57,299 --> 00:48:59,399
It's a very important hint.

1409
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,651
- Really? - Yes.

1410
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,068
- It didn't seem important. - Share it with us.

1411
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:04,454
- Share it with us. - Really?

1412
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,709
- Gosh. - What is it?

1413
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,124
(Startled)

1414
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,908
Let me announce the candidates for the last target.

1415
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:12,349
The candidates for the last target are...

1416
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,079
Jae Seok, Haha, Ji Hyo,

1417
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,218
Kwang Soo, Se Chan, and So Min.

1418
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,689
What are we supposed to do?

1419
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,800
Among those, the two people I choose...

1420
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,608
become the final candidates.

1421
00:49:24,989 --> 00:49:27,626
They will be announced on social media,

1422
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,294
- and internet users... - What?

1423
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,238
will decide who will be out through a live vote.

1424
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:33,439
A live vote?

1425
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,530
- A live vote? - On social media?

1426
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:40,511
The final two candidates are...

1427
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,448
Jae Seok and Haha.

1428
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,096
(Jae Seok and Haha)

1429
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,849
(They're chosen as the final target candidates.)

1430
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,020
- Who is the honeybee anyway? - It's driving me crazy.

1431
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,671
Now,

1432
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,758
there will be a vote on social media...

1433
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:58,578
to decide which of you two will be out.

1434
00:49:58,799 --> 00:49:59,840
My goodness.

1435
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,386
- Hello. - Hello.

1436
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,868
- I feel so frustrated. - So do I.

1437
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,198
We don't know who it is,

1438
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:10,809
but someone is trying to eliminate...

1439
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,193
one of us.

1440
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:14,439
Between Jae Seok and me,

1441
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,548
who do you think should be out?

1442
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:18,448
One of us has to be out.

1443
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,249
- Seriously... - I'm innocent.

1444
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,138
- I... - This is unfair.

1445
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,718
I really don't want to be eliminated.

1446
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,608
- Please. - Please.

1447
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,419
- Please. - Who is it anyway?

1448
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,106
Who is doing this to us?

1449
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,229
(Who should be eliminated?)

1450
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,426
(It's a close vote.)

1451
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,499
Let me announce the result.

1452
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,668
(The votes are in.)

1453
00:50:36,669 --> 00:50:37,999
Between you two...

1454
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,419
(Who did the voters choose as the final target?)

1455
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,899
Let me announce the result.

1456
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,068
(The votes are in.)

1457
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:48,399
Between you two...

1458
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,218
(Who did the voters choose as the final target?)

1459
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,039
The target becomes...

1460
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,109
(Who appealed to the voters more effectively?)

1461
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:00,806
(Jae Seok becomes the final target.)

1462
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,149
(Jae Seok won 65 percent of the votes.)

1463
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,160
Thank you.

1464
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,618
What?

1465
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:06,649
("Thank you"?)

1466
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,888
Did you see it correctly?

1467
00:51:07,889 --> 00:51:09,789
(Who should be eliminated?)

1468
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,419
(Oh, no.)

1469
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,488
(I was mistaken.)

1470
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:13,600
Jae Seok is the target?

1471
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,304
Jae Seok... Oh, right.

1472
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,729
(The final target becomes...)

1473
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,769
(Jae Seok.)

1474
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:24,338
I mean...

1475
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:25,521
(Bye, Jae Seok.)

1476
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:26,908
My goodness.

1477
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:29,008
(Jae Seok is dragged to somewhere.)

1478
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:31,302
I think the voters misunderstood.

1479
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,709
I mean...

1480
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,309
(What will happen to the target?)

1481
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,561
My gosh.

1482
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,079
The target has been decided.

1483
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,118
It's Jae Seok.

1484
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:42,584
(The rest of the members get ready for the race.)

1485
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:45,482
The race will start soon.

1486
00:51:45,889 --> 00:51:48,587
When you catch the honeybee, the race will be over.

1487
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,155
If you fail to catch the honeybee within the time limit,

1488
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,217
- you'll be penalized. - This is hard.

1489
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:55,099
(Jae Seok is the only person with a hint.)

1490
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,311
The race will start...

1491
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,350
in five,

1492
00:51:58,469 --> 00:51:59,519
four,

1493
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:01,120
three,

1494
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,249
two,

1495
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,079
one. Start.

1496
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,615
(It's the last chance to identify the honeybee. The race starts.)

1497
00:52:07,909 --> 00:52:10,749
We've never had this few hints.

1498
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:11,979
(There is only one hint.)

1499
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,919
And only Jae Seok knows the hint.

1500
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,149
(Jae Seok is the only one who knows the hint.)

1501
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:16,906
We have to find Jae Seok.

1502
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,959
Where is Jae Seok?

1503
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,158
(Jae Seok is the only key to identifying the honeybee.)

1504
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:22,342
- Se Chan. - Ji Hyo.

1505
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,520
Were you one of the candidates?

1506
00:52:25,029 --> 00:52:26,028
- I don't know. - What did you do?

1507
00:52:26,029 --> 00:52:27,769
Why do you stride towards us?

1508
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,285
Aren't we supposed to find Jae Seok?

1509
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,611
He is the target.

1510
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,064
Who was the other candidate, though?

1511
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:35,358
- I don't know. - You two weren't, right?

1512
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:36,838
- We? - Yes.

1513
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,475
We don't know who the other was, right?

1514
00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:41,278
We don't know the other candidate.

1515
00:52:41,279 --> 00:52:44,579
We need hints to find the honeybee.

1516
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,689
Let's discuss.

1517
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:47,063
We have no hints.

1518
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:49,845
Only Jae Seok has one, so we need to find him.

1519
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,959
But...

1520
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,588
Only Jae Seok knows, right?

1521
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,888
(How are we going to find him?)

1522
00:52:53,889 --> 00:52:55,981
To be honest, I'm suspecting Jae Seok.

1523
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:57,758
- I think so too. - Right?

1524
00:52:57,759 --> 00:52:59,368
Is all of this his plan?

1525
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,722
I can't trust what he tells us.

1526
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:05,399
I'm suspecting So Min because...

1527
00:53:05,739 --> 00:53:08,568
I thought the voice was Ji Hyo's.

1528
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:10,579
To be honest, I thought so too.

1529
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,548
It wasn't me. And I thought...

1530
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:14,064
it was a woman's voice.

1531
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:16,879
Because I'm not the honeybee, it has to be So Min.

1532
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,278
If we...

1533
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:20,419
All the suspicious people are coming here. My goodness.

1534
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:21,888
Were you three here together?

1535
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:23,404
The two of us were here, and Kwang Soo came later.

1536
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:24,959
We'll know if we rip off the name tag.

1537
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,829
What about So Min?

1538
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:27,988
- Me? - Should we do that?

1539
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:29,758
(Should we rip off So Min's name tag?)

1540
00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:31,258
- Me? What about me? - Should we do that?

1541
00:53:31,259 --> 00:53:33,169
- But we have too few hints. - Right.

1542
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,629
- We have nothing. - We should find Jae Seok.

1543
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,769
- We have to find him. - I'm confused.

1544
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:38,539
How did he become the target?

1545
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,983
The important thing is...

1546
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:41,539
Jae Seok became the target...

1547
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,994
on social media.

1548
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:45,238
- Between him and me... - Between him and you?

1549
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:46,593
You were one of the candidates?

1550
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,623
Yes, I was.

1551
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,731
You didn't know that?

1552
00:53:51,779 --> 00:53:53,048
- I didn't. - Me neither.

1553
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:54,289
- We didn't. - We didn't.

1554
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:55,300
(They finally find out who the other candidate was.)

1555
00:53:56,119 --> 00:53:57,359
- You knew, right? - Why did I know?

1556
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,289
- Because you chose us. - I didn't.

1557
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:01,359
(You chose the candidates.)

1558
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,249
- The writer told me. - It's so simple.

1559
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,359
- The writer told me. - Really?

1560
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,068
- I can't believe it. - She suddenly brings up the writer?

1561
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:08,816
The thing is,

1562
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,796
the writer told me, I swear.

1563
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:15,566
That's how I knew. Seriously, that's how I knew.

1564
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,209
Look at her.

1565
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,539
Let's see...

1566
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,309
But then the rules would be too simple.

1567
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,448
In any case, the target is Jae Seok. We have to find him.

1568
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:25,297
Let's do that. Let's find him first.

1569
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,818
- He is the only one with a hint. - But I can't find him anywhere.

1570
00:54:27,819 --> 00:54:29,072
If we...

1571
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:33,326
I can't stop thinking Jae Seok is the honeybee.

1572
00:54:34,929 --> 00:54:36,428
I'll look this way.

1573
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:38,248
(Everyone is looking for Jae Seok.)

1574
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,187
This is giving me a headache.

1575
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,368
Before, we got many hints.

1576
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:44,683
But we don't have any today.

1577
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:46,558
- Something must be going on. - Right.

1578
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,039
(Someone suddenly appears.)

1579
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,918
(The honeybee?)

1580
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,393
(The honeybee is here.)

1581
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,689
(The others have no idea.)

1582
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,377
- Jae Seok... - Let's check the library.

1583
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,559
(They all look for Jae Seok.)

1584
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,428
Where is Jae Seok?

1585
00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:12,698
- Over there, maybe? - What about here?

1586
00:55:12,699 --> 00:55:13,868
(With Jae Seok out of sight,)

1587
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:17,738
(the honeybee starts moving carefully.)

1588
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:21,506
(Does the honeybee know where Jae Seok is?)

1589
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:24,738
Jae Seok.

1590
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:25,778
(The others are still looking for Jae Seok.)

1591
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:26,789
Oh, my.

1592
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,178
(While looking for Jae Seok,)

1593
00:55:30,179 --> 00:55:32,311
(they find someone else.)

1594
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,988
(In a remote office...)

1595
00:55:35,989 --> 00:55:37,289
Release me.

1596
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,209
(They find Seok Jin who had been kidnapped.)

1597
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:42,455
(He is tied up.)

1598
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:46,528
- What happened? - Why should we release you?

1599
00:55:46,529 --> 00:55:48,329
- Release me. - Why should we release you?

1600
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,769
- Release me. - Hold on.

1601
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:52,335
We shouldn't release him. He was already eliminated.

1602
00:55:52,839 --> 00:55:54,039
He was eliminated.

1603
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,939
- Why should we release you? - You have to release me.

1604
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,302
- He is out. - You have to release me...

1605
00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:00,908
so that I can get back in the race.

1606
00:56:00,909 --> 00:56:02,579
"Save me. Trust me."

1607
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,318
When someone says that, never save that person.

1608
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,349
(He has 10 years of experience.)

1609
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,789
(Frustrated)

1610
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:08,800
That's not it.

1611
00:56:09,219 --> 00:56:11,078
If we release him,

1612
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:13,189
he'll try to rip off our name tags.

1613
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:15,351
This is driving me crazy. That's not it.

1614
00:56:15,529 --> 00:56:16,641
What about this?

1615
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:18,099
We release him and rip off his name tag.

1616
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,169
- We eliminate him? - Yes.

1617
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:20,180
(Should we release him and then eliminate him?)

1618
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:21,710
- We eliminate him? - Yes.

1619
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:23,499
- You can't do that. - Who knows?

1620
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,015
He might have a hint.

1621
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:26,609
- Hey. - Don't you think so?

1622
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:27,609
- Let's untie him. - Hey.

1623
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,669
Why would you rip my name tag?

1624
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,439
- We don't have any hints. - Hold on.

1625
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,149
- Tell us the hint, and you're free. - I don't know any hints.

1626
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:35,149
- Right, he has no clue. - But I know where it is.

1627
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,318
- Where is it? - It's under his name tag.

1628
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,370
- No, it's not! - All right.

1629
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,368
- We've untied him. - We've untied him.

1630
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:43,789
Now that I'm untied, I've become a part of your team.

1631
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:45,729
- Don't trust him. - It's the truth.

1632
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,388
- He's out. - You're right.

1633
00:56:47,389 --> 00:56:48,904
Rip it!

1634
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,152
- Don't! You shouldn't! - Rip it!

1635
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:59,174
(Will Haha be right and find a hint under his name tag?)

1636
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,249
Hey!

1637
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:02,778
(They rip his name tag.)

1638
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:03,992
It's not there. I'm sorry.

1639
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:06,260
Is it over?

1640
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:09,782
(It's empty under his name tag.)

1641
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,090
I'm sorry.

1642
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:13,919
Jee Seok Jin is completely out.

1643
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,232
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1644
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,818
- We're on the same team! - I'm sorry.

1645
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:18,588
Maybe it's under this one.

1646
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:20,388
- I think it is. Rip it. - 1, 2, 3.

1647
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:21,904
(Haha is convinced once again.)

1648
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,499
(Is it under the second name tag?)

1649
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,129
(Ripping)

1650
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:30,439
(There is nothing there once again.)

1651
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,651
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

1652
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,309
Jee Seok Jin is completely out.

1653
00:57:34,310 --> 00:57:35,778
- I'm sorry. - But why was he tied up?

1654
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:36,820
Why?

1655
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,531
You guys are fools!

1656
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,879
I told you.

1657
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,264
(Why was he tied up?)

1658
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,318
(He was confined here by the honeybee.)

1659
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,519
(He was banned from shouting or escaping on his own.)

1660
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,488
(If the members rescued him, he could join the final race.)

1661
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:58,156
(Seok Jin was telling the truth.)

1662
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,591
- It's here. - He was right.

1663
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,468
- Let me see. - It's here.

1664
00:58:02,469 --> 00:58:03,984
It's here!

1665
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,483
It's under his bottom.

1666
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:07,439
- Hold him! - Wait.

1667
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,638
Good job.

1668
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,164
(They find the hint.)

1669
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,492
- I got it. - "Mak"?

1670
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:15,278
You fools. The honeybees are our enemies.

1671
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:17,542
(Only one word is written on the hint.)

1672
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:19,849
- What does this mean? - We needed to escape.

1673
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:20,888
What is that?

1674
00:58:20,889 --> 00:58:22,333
("Mak"?)

1675
00:58:22,819 --> 00:58:24,273
What kind of a hint is this?

1676
00:58:25,489 --> 00:58:26,758
Jae Seok has a hint too.

1677
00:58:26,759 --> 00:58:29,729
If we rip him, it'll be killing 2 birds with 1 stone.

1678
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,659
I'm sorry. I truly am. No one could believe you.

1679
00:58:32,969 --> 00:58:36,434
You guys didn't even understand the rules of this game.

1680
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,083
- Let's go. - I have something to say.

1681
00:58:39,509 --> 00:58:42,008
Race start.

1682
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:43,050
(He declares the start of the race.)

1683
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,096
The real race has finally begun!

1684
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:47,908
- You can do it! - Let's go.

1685
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:49,879
- Let's. - Where can we get the hints?

1686
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,566
- How can we get it? - "Mak"?

1687
00:58:51,619 --> 00:58:53,488
- What does that mean? - I don't know.

1688
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:54,763
"Mak"?

1689
00:58:55,049 --> 00:58:56,088
Where is he?

1690
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:58,088
I'm going down to the first floor.

1691
00:58:58,089 --> 00:58:59,689
(Where did Jae Seok go with the hint?)

1692
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,608
(Suddenly)

1693
00:59:02,259 --> 00:59:04,599
(The honeybee appears...)

1694
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,691
(in front of them.)

1695
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,138
(They don't know what to do.)

1696
00:59:11,139 --> 00:59:13,269
(The honeybee slowly...)

1697
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:16,643
(approaches Kwang Soo.)

1698
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:19,508
(The honeybee...)

1699
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:22,751
(who controlled everything is right before his eyes.)

1700
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,249
(The honeybee only had to say one thing...)

1701
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,350
(for Jong Kook to be eliminated.)

1702
00:59:31,989 --> 00:59:35,689
(Every time it appeared,)

1703
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,760
(the members were faced with doom.)

1704
00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:41,229
(The very honeybee that they all feared...)

1705
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:44,539
(is standing right before him.)

1706
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:45,939
(He's hesitant to attack it...)

1707
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,767
(in case something goes wrong.)

1708
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,939
(For now, he runs away...)

1709
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:52,948
(in order to find help.)

1710
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:54,048
Haha!

1711
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,161
(He looks for help.)

1712
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:58,705
Goodness, it was right there.

1713
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:01,764
What should I do?

1714
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,600
What should I do?

1715
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,459
(He needs help.)

1716
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,419
Haha. Ji Hyo, come here.

1717
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,277
- Did you find the hint? - I saw the honeybee.

1718
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,017
- Where? - I saw it. It's here.

1719
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:16,593
But I don't know what to do with it.

1720
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:18,411
Who is it?

1721
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,508
Hey.

1722
01:00:19,509 --> 01:00:21,439
(He has found the honeybee,)

1723
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,652
(but he has no idea who it could be.)

1724
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,705
- Did you spot it? - It was just walking around.

1725
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,149
- Walking around? - Yes.

1726
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,749
It stood still when it approached me.

1727
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:32,849
(The honeybee is gone.)

1728
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:34,566
Hey, where is... There it is.

1729
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:35,818
See?

1730
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:36,829
(Exclaiming)

1731
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:41,789
(The honeybee is in front of them.)

1732
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,113
- It's the real... - What should we do?

1733
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,727
- It's the real honeybee. - I have the goosebumps.

1734
01:00:47,529 --> 01:00:48,579
What is that?

1735
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:52,647
(It slowly approaches them.)

1736
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,838
(If they catch the honeybee,)

1737
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,597
(the race is over.)

1738
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,879
(If they catch it,)

1739
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,209
(all this misery will be over.)

1740
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,331
If we rip its name tag, wouldn't all this be over?

1741
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:04,268
Wouldn't it?

1742
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,550
(There are three of them. They could win the fight.)

1743
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:08,860
Hey.

1744
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,789
(The honeybee gives hand signals.)

1745
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,789
Him?

1746
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:12,829
(The honeybee gives hand signals.)

1747
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,059
- It's the real honeybee. - Me?

1748
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,658
(It points at Ji Hyo and Se Chan in order.)

1749
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:18,829
He's the honeybee?

1750
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,345
(Nodding)

1751
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:21,599
He's the honeybee?

1752
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,068
(Is it trying to dupe them?)

1753
01:01:23,069 --> 01:01:24,999
It's weird for the honeybee to be saying that.

1754
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,687
I know. Can't we just rip its name tag?

1755
01:01:26,739 --> 01:01:29,039
Isn't it odd? Shouldn't we just rip its name tag?

1756
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,090
(They decide to do so.)

1757
01:01:30,509 --> 01:01:32,479
(If they rip its name tag, this race will be over.)

1758
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,579
- Rip it. - What is this?

1759
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,620
You're the real honeybee, right?

1760
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,130
Hold on.

1761
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:41,048
- Hold it. - Rip it.

1762
01:01:41,049 --> 01:01:42,758
- Rip it. - What does it say?

1763
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,158
(Ripping)

1764
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:45,818
- What does it say? - What does it say?

1765
01:01:45,819 --> 01:01:47,088
(The honeybee...)

1766
01:01:47,089 --> 01:01:49,028
(was Jae Seok.)

1767
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:52,059
It's... It's Jae Seok.

1768
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,329
(Was Jae Seok the one they'd been looking for?)

1769
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:56,451
- What is this? - What is this?

1770
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:58,138
- What is this? - What is this?

1771
01:01:58,139 --> 01:01:59,138
(Something is written on his back.)

1772
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:00,453
There's something back here.

1773
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:03,178
(The real honeybee is 3435.)

1774
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:04,678
(The real honeybee?)

1775
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:05,979
- Why did you rip mine? - Ji Hyo.

1776
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:07,408
There's something back here.

1777
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:08,419
(What was his identity?)

1778
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,718
(After becoming the final target, he was dragged somewhere.)

1779
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:14,567
(Suddenly)

1780
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:17,959
(Someone approached him...)

1781
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,756
(and kidnapped him.)

1782
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:26,599
(Sniffing)

1783
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,229
(He smelled cologne.)

1784
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:30,592
Jae Seok, please take off your blindfold.

1785
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:37,539
(After taking his blindfold off,)

1786
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,146
(he found a fake honeybee costume in front of him.)

1787
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,476
(There was no point in resisting.)

1788
01:02:44,949 --> 01:02:49,959
(If the members mistook him and ripped his name tag,)

1789
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,433
(they would be given 15 minutes to survive.)

1790
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:56,899
- What? - What happened to him?

1791
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,545
Tell us a hint or something.

1792
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:00,298
Who is the honeybee?

1793
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:02,129
(The real honeybee was controlling him.)

1794
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:03,281
- What is that? - What's going on?

1795
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,968
(A siren is turned on.)

1796
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:08,269
What's going on? What is that sound?

1797
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,678
(Perplexed)

1798
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:10,892
Is this some kind of a honeybee repellent?

1799
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,544
(Jae Seok, who cannot speak, is frustrated.)

1800
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,718
(Jae Seok is out.)

1801
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,407
Since you ripped the wrong honeybee's name tag,

1802
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:22,618
you have only 15 minutes left.

1803
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:23,669
(They are given 15 minutes.)

1804
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,059
(We have 15 minutes?)

1805
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,585
If you catch the honeybee, the race will end.

1806
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,386
If you cannot catch it in the given time,

1807
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,844
you will be penalized.

1808
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:35,229
(They have to eliminate the honeybee in 15 minutes.)

1809
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:37,838
Hold on. Jae Seok pointed at Se Chan?

1810
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,859
(Hold on.)

1811
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:41,109
(Jae Seok pointed at Se Chan.)

1812
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,109
Yes.

1813
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,523
(Jae Seok pointed at Se Chan.)

1814
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:49,806
(He kept pointing at Se Chan when he couldn't speak.)

1815
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:52,849
(Was Jae Seok telling the truth,)

1816
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:58,488
(and is Se Chan the real honeybee?)

1817
01:03:58,489 --> 01:04:00,829
(They decide to eliminate him.)

1818
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,559
- He's the one then. - Let's eliminate him.

1819
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,899
- It's him. - Hold on.

1820
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,629
- I have nothing. - Because...

1821
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:07,669
- Jae Seok was a fake one. - He pointed at you.

1822
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:09,329
- It's not me! - Get him!

1823
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,968
(Flustered, Se Chan runs away.)

1824
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:13,769
- What if I'm not it? - We only have 15 minutes! Hurry!

1825
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,790
- He's the one! - He is!

1826
01:04:15,909 --> 01:04:17,900
- It's Se Chan! - Jae Seok pointed at him.

1827
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:21,505
- It's him. - There's no other exit.

1828
01:04:21,549 --> 01:04:22,548
(They lose him.)

1829
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:23,934
No? Is it a dead end?

1830
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,137
- Is it a dead end? - It is.

1831
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,749
(Haha catches up to him.)

1832
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,559
(He corners Se Chan.)

1833
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,570
Hold on.

1834
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:31,973
This is a serious misunderstanding.

1835
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:34,859
(Kwang Soo and Ji Hyo catch up.)

1836
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,258
- Rip it. - Hold on.

1837
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:39,188
I'm being serious. This isn't right.

1838
01:04:39,259 --> 01:04:40,528
We only have 15 minutes.

1839
01:04:40,529 --> 01:04:42,198
- Rip it. - All right.

1840
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,523
Why are you resisting then?

1841
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:46,209
- No! - It's him!

1842
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,754
- Get him! - Hey!

1843
01:04:47,869 --> 01:04:50,939
(Se Chan resists with all his might.)

1844
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,596
(Ripping)

1845
01:04:53,009 --> 01:04:55,609
(They remove his name tag.)

1846
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,629
There's something on his back.

1847
01:04:56,819 --> 01:05:00,990
(Was he the real honeybee?)

1848
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:04,359
(Jae Seok's hint was "young".)

1849
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,689
(Or could it have meant 0?)

1850
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:10,599
(Or could it have meant young?)

1851
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:18,673
(If he's the real honeybee, what does this hint mean?)

1852
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:21,468
- We're right! - We were!

1853
01:05:21,469 --> 01:05:24,005
(Se Chan was the honeybee.)

1854
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:26,278
(Thanks to Jae Seok,)

1855
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:31,704
(the real honeybee was caught so easily.)

1856
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:33,948
Hello. Hello.

1857
01:05:33,949 --> 01:05:36,919
(Se Chan the honeybee)

1858
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:42,211
(This race was made by his request.)

1859
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,959
(The person who wore the costume...)

1860
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,229
(and controlled the entire situation was...)

1861
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:51,390
(Se Chan.)

1862
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:54,468
(They successfully caught the honeybee.)

1863
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:56,227
Hold on. Is this it?

1864
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:58,508
- Is this the end? - It was too obvious.

1865
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:01,149
- Jae Seok pointed at him. - Is this it?

1866
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,493
(It's too weird for this to be the end.)

1867
01:06:02,779 --> 01:06:05,448
- By the way... - Honeybee Se Chan is out.

1868
01:06:05,449 --> 01:06:07,369
(The real honeybee is finally eliminated.)

1869
01:06:08,049 --> 01:06:09,289
However, the race...

1870
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:10,818
- isn't over. - What?

1871
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:12,738
(The race is not over yet.)

1872
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:14,658
(The race...)

1873
01:06:14,659 --> 01:06:17,528
(isn't over?)

1874
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:18,811
It's not over?

1875
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:21,729
(What has happened?)

1876
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:22,729
Is there another honeybee?

1877
01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,295
(Could it be?)

1878
01:06:28,869 --> 01:06:29,879
(They still need to figure out who it is.)

1879
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,496
What does 3435 mean?

1880
01:06:31,909 --> 01:06:32,948
3435?

1881
01:06:32,949 --> 01:06:33,990
(What does it mean?)

1882
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:39,149
(This hint was found...)

1883
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:42,118
(under Jae Seok's name tag.)

1884
01:06:44,659 --> 01:06:45,700
No way.

1885
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:48,908
- No way. - What is it?

1886
01:06:49,029 --> 01:06:50,575
So Min's phone number has...

1887
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:54,298
34 in it, and Jong Kook's has 35.

1888
01:06:54,869 --> 01:06:55,868
They're like siblings on this show!

1889
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:59,232
(Are Jong Kook and So Min the culprits?)

1890
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,629
- It's them? - 3435.

1891
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,609
(Jong Kook suddenly appeared out of nowhere...)

1892
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,109
(after getting eliminated.)

1893
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:13,442
(Then he suddenly attacked the second target, Seok Jin.)

1894
01:07:14,819 --> 01:07:19,488
(In the second video, the honeybee had a female voice.)

1895
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:22,389
(They suspected So Min.)

1896
01:07:22,589 --> 01:07:25,599
(They acted unusually and seemed very closely...)

1897
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,145
(during the opening segment.)

1898
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:29,144
We need to find Jong Kook first.

1899
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:31,351
Let's go.

1900
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:33,638
- I'll scream if I find him. - Okay.

1901
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:35,209
- I'll scream, so come find me. - All right.

1902
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,579
(The trio decides to look for Jong Kook first.)

1903
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,809
(Is 3435 really related to their phone numbers?)

1904
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,079
Can I enter here?

1905
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,749
(Jong Kook is nowhere to be seen.)

1906
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:48,649
(Suddenly)

1907
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:53,336
(Ji Hyo finds him.)

1908
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:56,528
(He's tied up and confined.)

1909
01:07:56,529 --> 01:07:57,539
You startled me.

1910
01:07:58,299 --> 01:07:59,411
I'm alone.

1911
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,841
(He wants her to enter.)

1912
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,928
No. Hold on.

1913
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:11,614
(I'm too scared. I'll come back later.)

1914
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,178
Is no one else in that room? Hold on.

1915
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:15,392
I'm so scared.

1916
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,162
Haha!

1917
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:19,535
Hurry up, Kwang Soo!

1918
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,908
- Haha! - What is it?

1919
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,475
Hurry up, Kwang Soo!

1920
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,556
(Haha, who was nearby, comes towards her.)

1921
01:08:28,029 --> 01:08:32,128
(They go into the room Jong Kook is confined in.)

1922
01:08:32,129 --> 01:08:33,179
What is this?

1923
01:08:34,299 --> 01:08:37,168
(Untie me right now.)

1924
01:08:37,169 --> 01:08:39,594
(No, you could be the honeybee.)

1925
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:41,508
Don't get mad.

1926
01:08:41,509 --> 01:08:42,538
(They're unsure of his identity.)

1927
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:43,739
I'll remove this duct tape.

1928
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,052
(They're unsure of his identity.)

1929
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:47,228
Hey.

1930
01:08:48,049 --> 01:08:51,009
Hurry up! What are you doing? Untie me!

1931
01:08:53,419 --> 01:08:59,019
(A while ago, Seok Jin was in the same situation.)

1932
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,201
(And a hint was hidden.)

1933
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:07,828
First, we need to see the hint. We need more hints.

1934
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:08,880
Okay.

1935
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,468
- I've untied you. - Okay.

1936
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:12,116
- Don't eliminate me. - You're not completely out.

1937
01:09:12,169 --> 01:09:13,439
- Don't eliminate me. - I won't.

1938
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:14,538
All right, stand up.

1939
01:09:14,539 --> 01:09:16,126
- Okay, don't eliminate me. - Okay.

1940
01:09:16,209 --> 01:09:18,027
Okay, I'm no longer its puppet.

1941
01:09:18,509 --> 01:09:19,508
That honeybee...

1942
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:21,196
(Is he the honeybee or a mere victim?)

1943
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:25,898
How does it feel to be the first one eliminated?

1944
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,330
How does it feel?

1945
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:30,447
You have 30 minutes from now...

1946
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,984
to rip the second target's name tag.

1947
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:35,279
If you fail to do so,

1948
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,256
you will receive a great punishment,

1949
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,674
so make sure you do.

1950
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:43,798
(He only eliminated Seok Jin...)

1951
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:47,345
(because of what the honeybee said.)

1952
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:51,208
(He was merely a puppet.)

1953
01:09:51,209 --> 01:09:52,239
- What is it? - What?

1954
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,582
(Haha finds the hint that was under Jong Kook.)

1955
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:58,678
(The previous hint was "mak".)

1956
01:09:58,679 --> 01:09:59,729
- What is it? - Let me see.

1957
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:03,119
(This time, the hint says...)

1958
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:06,392
("nae".)

1959
01:10:07,129 --> 01:10:10,089
- Look at this. - What is it?

1960
01:10:10,259 --> 01:10:11,298
- It's "mak"... - and "nae".

1961
01:10:11,299 --> 01:10:12,298
It means "the youngest".

1962
01:10:12,299 --> 01:10:14,088
(The youngest)

1963
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:16,668
(The most crucial hint was...)

1964
01:10:16,669 --> 01:10:18,861
("the youngest".)

1965
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:21,708
So Min is the youngest one among us.

1966
01:10:21,709 --> 01:10:23,801
- It's Se Chan and So Min! - You're right!

1967
01:10:25,709 --> 01:10:27,048
Hello.

1968
01:10:27,049 --> 01:10:28,309
(So Min was...)

1969
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:30,976
(the other honeybee.)

1970
01:10:32,749 --> 01:10:35,012
- I feel so excited. - United?

1971
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,314
(She schemed with Se Chan.)

1972
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:41,428
(There are two targets.)

1973
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:43,651
(Since I'm democratic, I'll give you all a chance.)

1974
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:45,599
(So Min hid her identity...)

1975
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,620
(and controlled Seok Jin and Jong Kook.)

1976
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:53,208
(After Jae Seok was eliminated, a 15-minute countdown started.)

1977
01:10:53,509 --> 01:10:55,459
- What is that? - I need to hide.

1978
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:00,182
(To protect her cover, she hid from the members.)

1979
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,078
- Let's go and catch her. - We have no time.

1980
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:04,332
- Let's go. - Okay.

1981
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,532
Is this it for the hints?

1982
01:11:07,919 --> 01:11:09,788
(Jae Seok's hint has not been solved.)

1983
01:11:09,789 --> 01:11:11,174
3435?

1984
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,721
(The real honeybee is 3435.)

1985
01:11:15,889 --> 01:11:17,141
What could this mean?

1986
01:11:17,929 --> 01:11:19,818
Maybe they're 34 and 35 years old.

1987
01:11:20,799 --> 01:11:22,029
(Could it be their ages?)

1988
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:23,140
Their ages?

1989
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:24,850
You're right.

1990
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:28,909
(Se Chan and So Min are...)

1991
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:34,737
(34 years old.)

1992
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,918
(Then what about 35?)

1993
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,060
Who's 35 years old then?

1994
01:11:42,389 --> 01:11:43,703
Isn't that Kwang Soo?

1995
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:46,418
Perhaps there are three honeybees.

1996
01:11:46,419 --> 01:11:47,944
34 and 35 years old?

1997
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:49,428
Isn't Kwang Soo a year older?

1998
01:11:49,429 --> 01:11:50,541
But he's not the youngest.

1999
01:11:51,629 --> 01:11:54,457
He was the youngest before the other two joined us.

2000
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,739
(He was the former youngest member.)

2001
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:58,750
You're right.

2002
01:11:59,169 --> 01:12:00,179
You're right.

2003
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:03,279
- He's the oldest among them. - Right.

2004
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:06,886
(Are all the pieces of the puzzle in place now?)

2005
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:09,508
You're a honeybee as well?

2006
01:12:09,509 --> 01:12:10,691
There's one more.

2007
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:12,033
Right, there are three chairs.

2008
01:12:14,389 --> 01:12:16,588
(The remaining honeybee who decided...)

2009
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:18,689
(to join this scheme alongside the other two was...)

2010
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,659
(the former youngest member, Kwang Soo.)

2011
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,841
It's him.

2012
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:25,828
You three...

2013
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:26,899
(The youngest trio)

2014
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:28,587
are the youngest members.

2015
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:32,502
- You've been assisting the others. - Right.

2016
01:12:33,469 --> 01:12:34,581
It must be hard.

2017
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,425
It's obvious.

2018
01:12:37,009 --> 01:12:39,605
We're always the ones who wrap things up.

2019
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:41,520
Wait.

2020
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:43,939
You keep saying that we're the youngest members.

2021
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:47,119
(He clarifies.)

2022
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,349
- What's wrong? - I'm no longer the youngest.

2023
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,689
It's been a while.

2024
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:53,244
- We're only a year apart. - Hey, this is the beginning.

2025
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,357
Well... It's true that they don't show me any manners.

2026
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,312
I admit to that.

2027
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:01,599
But I don't think I should be a part of this team.

2028
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,468
But still, you're the captain of our team.

2029
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:05,739
You should act as our leader.

2030
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,038
(Do you not want to?)

2031
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:09,464
- If that's the case... - You're our captain.

2032
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:11,178
- Okay. - You'll be...

2033
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:15,048
(He quickly accepts it.)

2034
01:13:15,049 --> 01:13:16,059
He likes it.

2035
01:13:16,209 --> 01:13:17,694
We need to team up.

2036
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,178
You must feel burdened.

2037
01:13:19,179 --> 01:13:21,139
Captain, let's teach them a lesson.

2038
01:13:21,549 --> 01:13:23,519
- Lead us. - Yes, please.

2039
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,659
(That was how he became their captain.)

2040
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,700
(He was deprived of his ballot from the start.)

2041
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:36,217
(They became anxious and regretted assigning him as their captain.)

2042
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:38,838
Where are we going?

2043
01:13:38,839 --> 01:13:40,668
(When they were kidnapping Jae Seok...)

2044
01:13:40,669 --> 01:13:41,679
(He smelled cologne.)

2045
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:44,457
Is Kwang Soo here?

2046
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,409
(Due to his cologne, he almost got caught.)

2047
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:49,722
This is his cologne.

2048
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:52,819
- Why did you spray cologne? - I forgot.

2049
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:54,888
We don't even have guests, so why did you?

2050
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,909
I can't believe he's so good at smelling.

2051
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,893
(Only Kwang Soo and So Min remain.)

2052
01:14:02,389 --> 01:14:05,029
- All right. - We only have five minutes.

2053
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:06,699
We ripped Jae Seok's name tag.

2054
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,998
- You did? - Yes.

2055
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,081
(The honeybees' identities are revealed.)

2056
01:14:09,469 --> 01:14:10,479
So Min!

2057
01:14:11,299 --> 01:14:13,531
- Kwang Soo! - Kwang Soo!

2058
01:14:14,639 --> 01:14:16,109
So Min, it was Kwang Soo.

2059
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,479
I found them!

2060
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:21,878
(The honeybees lose if they get eliminated by them.)

2061
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,109
(They need to hold out until the time is over.)

2062
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:24,178
No, no.

2063
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:26,098
(They need to hold out until the time is over.)

2064
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:27,701
I need to hide.

2065
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:29,531
So Min!

2066
01:14:29,889 --> 01:14:31,119
So Min, we're all here!

2067
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:32,288
(They need to find the honeybees.)

2068
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:33,471
It was Kwang Soo!

2069
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:37,399
(She also hides from them.)

2070
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,612
Where should I hide?

2071
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,628
(She goes to the auditorium.)

2072
01:14:40,629 --> 01:14:41,679
Here?

2073
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:50,128
(She finds a place in a corner of the auditorium.)

2074
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:52,189
Goodness.

2075
01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:56,702
I'm so scared. If I get caught, there's nowhere to run.

2076
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:58,661
Seriously.

2077
01:14:59,379 --> 01:15:04,267
(Captain Kwang Soo also looks for a place to hide.)

2078
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:09,921
(He tries to hide by becoming one with the stairs.)

2079
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:13,858
(He thinks he won't be seen.)

2080
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:16,784
Or should I lie there and look out?

2081
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:20,891
- Kwang Soo. - It's Kwang Soo.

2082
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,779
(They're not far.)

2083
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:24,779
I heard them.

2084
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,526
(They're not far.)

2085
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:33,647
(Jong Kook is near him.)

2086
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:36,319
No.

2087
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,582
(He senses danger.)

2088
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:42,059
(He takes a peek at the direction where the voices came.)

2089
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,070
Where are they?

2090
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:45,142
I think I heard them say my name.

2091
01:15:45,429 --> 01:15:49,773
(Feeling threatened, he attempts to move.)

2092
01:15:53,469 --> 01:15:58,328
(Suddenly)

2093
01:15:59,839 --> 01:16:04,418
(Jong Kook looks around Kwang Soo's area.)

2094
01:16:04,419 --> 01:16:05,918
I think someone was over there.

2095
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:06,960
(Did he spot Kwang Soo?)

2096
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,288
I saw someone.

2097
01:16:08,289 --> 01:16:13,239
(He quickly moves towards him.)

2098
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:17,828
(They're both on the same floor.)

2099
01:16:17,829 --> 01:16:22,577
(They're getting closer and closer.)

2100
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,731
(Kwang Soo hides in an isolated place at the end of the hallway.)

2101
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,661
Go, go. Give me the camera and go.

2102
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:36,079
(The staff pulls out not to attract attention.)

2103
01:16:37,579 --> 01:16:39,469
(At that time,)

2104
01:16:40,919 --> 01:16:44,728
(he spots the staff who was pulling out on Kwang Soo's order.)

2105
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:51,455
(I can hear his footsteps.)

2106
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:59,049
(Jong Kook is searching every place on the route that the staff took.)

2107
01:17:01,940 --> 01:17:04,239
(Please go somewhere else.)

2108
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,250
Please.

2109
01:17:06,509 --> 01:17:10,109
(As he looks around,)

2110
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,718
(Jong Kook finds where Kwang Soo is.)

2111
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:19,981
(Will he be able to find Kwang Soo?)

2112
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:23,963
(Jong Kook moves in the opposite direction of Kwang Soo.)

2113
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,644
(He's saved.)

2114
01:17:28,030 --> 01:17:31,574
(Now, only about 2 minutes remain.)

2115
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:33,199
The time is going so slowly.

2116
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,987
(If they can last, it will be Team Honeybee's victory.)

2117
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,757
Did So Min get eliminated?

2118
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,090
So Min...

2119
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,095
Did Kwang Soo eliminate her?

2120
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:44,378
You can't get eliminated, So Min.

2121
01:17:44,379 --> 01:17:46,944
(Because we'll eliminate you.)

2122
01:17:47,749 --> 01:17:48,759
What is that sound?

2123
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:55,884
(The chasers are getting close to the auditorium where So Min is.)

2124
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:58,114
I'm scared. What should I do?

2125
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:00,112
I'm scared.

2126
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,153
So Min.

2127
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:07,814
(Haha and Ji Hyo enter the auditorium.)

2128
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:10,364
(This is where So Min is hiding.)

2129
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:16,208
(Please just go.)

2130
01:18:16,209 --> 01:18:20,159
(It's impossible to run away to another hiding place now.)

2131
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:23,342
(At that time,)

2132
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:28,974
(Haha approaches the stage where So Min is hiding.)

2133
01:18:29,759 --> 01:18:33,870
(So Min senses danger and moves in deeper to hide.)

2134
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:40,120
(He gets close to where So Min is hiding.)

2135
01:18:42,669 --> 01:18:45,138
(However, he's looking up.)

2136
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:47,949
(He fails to find So Min.)

2137
01:18:47,950 --> 01:18:48,949
What is this?

2138
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:50,970
(What is this?)

2139
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,631
Why are you here, So Min?

2140
01:18:52,679 --> 01:18:54,689
It's nothing. It's not what you think.

2141
01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:55,849
(I'm doomed.)

2142
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,001
What's wrong?

2143
01:18:57,789 --> 01:18:58,788
I was just hiding.

2144
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:00,388
Come here. We have to go catch Kwang Soo.

2145
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:01,559
(Come on out now.)

2146
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,357
So Min, it's Kwang Soo.

2147
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,439
So Min.

2148
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:07,487
- Why did you... - You brat.

2149
01:19:07,629 --> 01:19:09,689
Why did you go off on your own today?

2150
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:11,152
I was looking for Kwang Soo.

2151
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,968
- Let's go. - I was looking for Kwang Soo.

2152
01:19:12,969 --> 01:19:14,929
- We only have five minutes. - Here's Kwang Soo.

2153
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,109
Kwang Soo...

2154
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,538
- You little rascal. - Kwang Soo...

2155
01:19:17,539 --> 01:19:18,924
(Giving her a lesson)

2156
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,338
(So Min is eliminated.)

2157
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:21,360
How dare you?

2158
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,849
- You're the youngest. - Haha.

2159
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:25,519
How could the youngest cause a rebellion?

2160
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,469
- No. Hurry. - You rascal.

2161
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:29,332
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2162
01:19:29,919 --> 01:19:31,909
Let's hurry. Hurry, hurry.

2163
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:34,579
To be honest, I want to chase people.

2164
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:37,527
Hiding is too scary. It was so scary.

2165
01:19:37,759 --> 01:19:39,648
Hiding there was so scary.

2166
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,399
1 minute and 30 seconds to the end of the race.

2167
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,025
(If he lasts 1 minute and 30 seconds, he'll win the race.)

2168
01:19:46,669 --> 01:19:47,882
Gosh, I'm going to lose.

2169
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:50,479
(Not that much time is left.)

2170
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:51,853
Isn't he inside here?

2171
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:53,279
Hey, there's only one minute left.

2172
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,748
- Go catch him now. - He's not here.

2173
01:19:54,749 --> 01:19:55,779
- He's not here. - He's not here.

2174
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:56,861
We didn't see him come in here.

2175
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:00,175
(I just need to hold out a bit longer.)

2176
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:03,418
(Jong Kook searches the place...)

2177
01:20:03,419 --> 01:20:05,177
(where suspicious movements were spotted earlier.)

2178
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:09,469
(He searches the opposite side which he didn't search earlier.)

2179
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,492
(And...)

2180
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,301
(he finds Kwang Soo who was hiding.)

2181
01:20:18,999 --> 01:20:23,887
(The real hunt starts with less than 1 minute left.)

2182
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,196
He's right here. He's here!

2183
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:29,349
(These bee-farmers are gathering upon Jong Kook's call.)

2184
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:30,378
He's upstairs.

2185
01:20:30,379 --> 01:20:31,649
(These bee-farmers are gathering upon Jong Kook's call.)

2186
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:32,649
He's here!

2187
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,649
(The last honeybee meets a dead end as he tries to run away in a hurry.)

2188
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:38,458
(Jong Kook stays close, so he doesn't get away.)

2189
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,619
- He's here. - How long do I have left?

2190
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:40,639
Just 30 more seconds.

2191
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:42,172
He's here.

2192
01:20:42,329 --> 01:20:44,450
- Where? - He's here.

2193
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,041
He's here.

2194
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:47,569
What time is it?

2195
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:48,742
- How long do I have left? - Here.

2196
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,038
He's right here. Haha, come here!

2197
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:52,439
(Kwang Soo is completely surrounded.)

2198
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,834
- Haha. - 20 seconds before time is up.

2199
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,456
Please. Please.

2200
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:58,054
Go over there. Go in there.

2201
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,290
Go in there.

2202
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:01,423
I'm sure he'll come to my side.

2203
01:21:02,549 --> 01:21:04,943
- 10, 9, 8, - 9, 8,

2204
01:21:05,419 --> 01:21:07,137
- 7, 6, - 7...

2205
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,436
- Hurry! - 5, 4,

2206
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,319
- 3, 2, 1. - 1.

2207
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,718
(Kwang Soo tries to hold out with every ounce of his energy.)

2208
01:21:13,719 --> 01:21:15,103
- The race is over. - Yes!

2209
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:16,170
(I did it!)

2210
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,258
- The race is over. - Yes!

2211
01:21:19,259 --> 01:21:21,148
(Kwang Soo, the honeybee, wins.)

2212
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:25,700
(That was so close. I could have won.)

2213
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,325
We should've found him a bit earlier.

2214
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:29,420
I had a gut feeling.

2215
01:21:29,539 --> 01:21:30,638
I was just going to pass by.

2216
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,038
(Kwang Soo withstood their joint attack.)

2217
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:33,089
I won.

2218
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:34,291
At last.

2219
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:39,279
Everyone, the winning team of Honeybee's Counterattack Race...

2220
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:40,788
- is Team Honeybee. - Yes!

2221
01:21:40,789 --> 01:21:42,718
(Team Honeybee wins.)

2222
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:43,718
Yes!

2223
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:44,989
(You guys won by a close call.)

2224
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,088
- Yes! - Gosh.

2225
01:21:46,089 --> 01:21:47,171
You're frustrating.

2226
01:21:47,329 --> 01:21:49,652
Hey, Kwang Soo. We all did our part.

2227
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:50,810
We all did our part.

2228
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,919
It was good. We did well. We all did well.

2229
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,185
Let's wash away our disappointment.

2230
01:21:55,329 --> 01:21:56,480
For today's penalty,

2231
01:21:57,339 --> 01:22:00,500
the three of the youngest members will each pick a member.

2232
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:03,093
And those three members will face the penalty.

2233
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:05,239
The youngest members will give the chosen members a stick.

2234
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,057
(The members are forced to get a stick.)

2235
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:09,708
A stick? Whom should I hit?

2236
01:22:09,709 --> 01:22:11,319
Gosh, that's a neat penalty.

2237
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,078
I don't think I'll get picked, guys.

2238
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:15,171
(Pretending to be close with them)

2239
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,048
(We're close, aren't we?)

2240
01:22:17,049 --> 01:22:19,258
- Right? It's not me, right? - It's about time he gets one.

2241
01:22:19,259 --> 01:22:21,828
(It's about time he gets one.)

2242
01:22:21,829 --> 01:22:22,828
It's about time.

2243
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:25,788
I didn't think the penalty would be that harsh.

2244
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:28,722
When will you have the chance to hit Jong Kook if not today?

2245
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:30,869
Everyone, his bottom is toned up.

2246
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,617
He's been running and exercising.

2247
01:22:33,469 --> 01:22:35,638
Seok Jin is...

2248
01:22:35,639 --> 01:22:37,239
- getting lazy. He deserves a stick. - Seriously.

2249
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,739
(Whispering)

2250
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,537
Lazy? He said Seok Jin got lazy.

2251
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:45,949
(My gosh, did you just call me lazy?)

2252
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:48,312
Go for Jong Kook, you know? You know?

2253
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:49,430
We will whisper.

2254
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:51,059
(They'll whisper who will get the stick.)

2255
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:52,559
- If that person's name is spoken, - Okay.

2256
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:53,958
- you can just lie down. - Great.

2257
01:22:53,959 --> 01:22:55,388
I'll whisper, so others can't hear it.

2258
01:22:55,389 --> 01:22:57,178
- Great, great. - We'll have to pass it down?

2259
01:22:57,759 --> 01:22:59,828
(My choice is...)

2260
01:22:59,829 --> 01:23:00,869
Lie down.

2261
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,254
(He reveals his choice right away.)

2262
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,269
(Excuse me.)

2263
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:07,409
- Lie down. - Jae Seok.

2264
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:09,460
- Wasn't that meant for you? - You said I had to pass it down.

2265
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,490
You lie down.

2266
01:23:11,709 --> 01:23:12,878
Jae Seok, please lie down.

2267
01:23:12,879 --> 01:23:15,273
- Should I relay this message? - This is funny.

2268
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,279
It's my turn.

2269
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:17,619
(So Min chooses...)

2270
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:18,630
Lie down, please.

2271
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:22,449
(Whispering)

2272
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:23,918
(Whom did Se Chan choose?)

2273
01:23:23,919 --> 01:23:25,939
- Gosh, Se Chan... - What did he say?

2274
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:29,000
Come here.

2275
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,458
(Se Chan chooses Jae Seok.)

2276
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:32,743
It wasn't Jong Kook?

2277
01:23:32,900 --> 01:23:33,910
It wasn't?

2278
01:23:34,329 --> 01:23:35,339
- It's me? - Lie down.

2279
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,798
- Hold on. - Hadn't you pointed at me...

2280
01:23:37,799 --> 01:23:38,809
My goodness.

2281
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,939
- I can't believe this. - I'll just do my share.

2282
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:42,609
- Okay. - You were eliminated...

2283
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:44,138
- because of him. - I got eliminated because of you.

2284
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:45,138
- He left it at home. - That's nice.

2285
01:23:45,139 --> 01:23:47,028
(Slapping)

2286
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:49,779
That must hurt.

2287
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,819
Great.

2288
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:51,860
(Slapping)

2289
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,048
(It hurts.)

2290
01:23:54,049 --> 01:23:55,218
- It sounded nice too. - That must hurt.

2291
01:23:55,219 --> 01:23:56,888
(It's So Min's turn next.)

2292
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:59,949
My goodness. That sounded nice.

2293
01:24:00,389 --> 01:24:01,703
Are you all right?

2294
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:03,088
Come on.

2295
01:24:03,089 --> 01:24:04,599
(It's the grand finale, the finisher's turn.)

2296
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:05,628
Come on.

2297
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:07,246
(Here comes the last stick!)

2298
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,411
(Slapping hard)

2299
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:12,517
(He slaps Jae Seok as much as he loves Jae Seok.)

2300
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:17,008
(I'm fine as long as you youngest had fun.)

2301
01:24:17,009 --> 01:24:18,252
- That must hurt. - The sound was great.

2302
01:24:18,539 --> 01:24:19,589
- That was great. - My gosh.

2303
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,849
- Se Chan, you did well. - Okay.

2304
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:23,008
Today's victory goes to...

2305
01:24:23,009 --> 01:24:25,048
- the youngest members! - Okay!

2306
01:24:25,049 --> 01:24:28,221
(The counterattack of the youngest is a big success.)

2307
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:32,088
(To celebrate spring, they have an orientation for new students.)

2308
01:24:32,419 --> 01:24:34,189
(At this friendly Running Man College,)

2309
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:37,089
(3 new students show up.)

2310
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:39,721
(Hong Jin Young, the master of trot)

2311
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:42,599
I'm trying hard to approach people in a friendly and kind way.

2312
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,690
(Han Da Gam, the beauty of Drama Department)

2313
01:24:44,799 --> 01:24:46,152
It's Keum Sae Rok.

2314
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,634
(Keum Sae Rok, a newbie to variety shows)

2315
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:52,108
(These new students' excitement explodes.)

2316
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:55,149
(It's a collection of games only hip students play at school.)

2317
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:56,765
(Oh, you know how to have fun.)

2318
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,019
(But...)

2319
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,019
A returning student?

2320
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:02,383
(A clueless returning student is among these new students.)

2321
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,745
(Who is this returning student that kills the mood?)

2322
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:10,458
(Who released the orange fart?)

2323
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:12,116
(You farted.)

2324
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,345
(Farting)

2325
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:20,927
(What's Wrong with My Class Year?)
