1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,179
(One day in March in fickle weather...)

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,190
What is this?

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,349
Hello.

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,609
(Everyone starts at different locations.)

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,079
We're going to put a sticker on you.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,118
What sticker?

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,349
(They start with stickers on.)

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,788
(Why is there a sticker all of a sudden?)

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:21,799
What is this?

10
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,272
Is that 11? What is it?

11
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,589
(The staff is attaching math signs and numbers.)

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,758
What is this?

13
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,840
(The staff is attaching math signs and numbers.)

14
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,258
Why are you putting them on all of a sudden?

15
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:31,512
(Everyone all gets their stickers.)

16
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,216
What is this? Why do I have 11 on my back?

17
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:35,287
It's not number 1? It's a minus sign?

18
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:36,679
What is this?

19
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,738
"When all eight members gather, you can enter the place of the opening."

20
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,295
"Come to 276-8, Seongsu-dong 2-ga, Seongdong-gu,"

21
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,939
"Seoul." What does this sentence mean?

22
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,868
"When all eight members gather"?

23
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,576
Does it mean we can't enter if even one member doesn't come?

24
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,793
I'm sure everyone will show up.

25
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,706
- You can set out now. - Let's go then.

26
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,318
I'm sure everyone will come. Why wouldn't they?

27
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:57,138
(Everyone individually sets out to the place of their mission.)

28
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,988
(Gosh, I'm really curious what this is about.)

29
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,707
I'm really curious what this is about.

30
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,634
I don't get it. I have the number 254? 254?

31
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,183
Is it about the alphabet?

32
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,269
A, B, C, D...

33
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,268
(He confused the equal symbol for number 11.)

34
00:01:10,269 --> 00:01:12,563
I'm K. In English, I'm K.

35
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,438
(When everyone is trying to figure it out, Kwang Soo is...)

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,894
- Hello? - Hey.

37
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:18,221
Kwang Soo, what is this about?

38
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,462
They put something on my back.

39
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,025
You're on your way, right? What's on your back?

40
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,379
I couldn't see it. They didn't let me see it.

41
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,461
They said I wasn't allowed to.

42
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:24,861
Look at the sticker now.

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,811
- I'm not lying. - Don't lie. Look and tell me.

44
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,947
- What? - Stop lying. Look and tell me.

45
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,105
Oh, I saw it. I saw it. I could see it.

46
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,844
This is my number.

47
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,545
It's 57. It's 57.

48
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,809
Hey, I'm hanging up.

49
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,298
I'm serious.

50
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,309
(He's not falling for it.)

51
00:01:41,169 --> 00:01:42,310
Hello, Haha.

52
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,984
- Hello. - Hello, Haha.

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,291
- They want us to gather. - Right.

54
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,632
I don't know what they put on my back.

55
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,578
What's yours? What's on your back?

56
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:51,679
I have a heart symbol.

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,149
(That's the biggest fake ever.)

58
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,190
I have a diamond symbol.

59
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,748
What?

60
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:56,879
I have a diamond symbol.

61
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,578
(My gosh, unbelievable.)

62
00:01:58,579 --> 00:01:59,630
Haha, stop it.

63
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,418
- What do you mean? - Just be honest for once.

64
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,006
- Why do you say that? - Haha.

65
00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,989
Please just once. Please be honest just for once.

66
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,181
Okay. I have a minus sign.

67
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,459
(I have the minus sign.)

68
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,599
Don't kid with me.

69
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,811
I'm being serious.

70
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:15,951
What's yours?

71
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,010
I have a plus sign.

72
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,439
(I have the plus sign.)

73
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,868
Wait, is this what I think it is?

74
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:21,951
You don't have the minus sign, right?

75
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,352
No, I don't. I have the plus sign.

76
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,690
I have the minus sign.

77
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,463
- You have the minus sign? - Yes.

78
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,463
Then why did you say you had the plus sign?

79
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,031
Because you said you had the minus sign.

80
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,431
I actually have the minus sign.

81
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,970
I actually have the plus sign. Let's just hang up now.

82
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,129
Haha.

83
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,441
You're draining my energy from the start.

84
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,576
- This is funny. - I'm already exhausted.

85
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,821
I will recognize your scamming skills.

86
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,015
- Okay. I'll see you there. - See you there.

87
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:46,428
Okay.

88
00:02:46,429 --> 00:02:48,868
(What was their power struggle for?)

89
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,199
(He only gets exhausted and more questions.)

90
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,210
I should rest up.

91
00:02:52,369 --> 00:02:53,451
I'm so tired.

92
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,668
I'll know once we all get together.

93
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:57,760
(All 8 of them are assembling to find the meaning of the sticker.)

94
00:02:58,739 --> 00:02:59,790
We're here.

95
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,522
This is the place.

96
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,029
This is the place.

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,630
Is someone already here?

98
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,454
(The giraffe who is exhausted is the first one to arrive.)

99
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,988
(Looking around)

100
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:11,999
Hey!

101
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,182
(What's this?)

102
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,699
There's a passcode.

103
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,345
(A three-digit combination lock)

104
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,798
(Why is this locked?)

105
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,798
I need a three-digit number.

106
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,890
(How am I supposed to figure this out?)

107
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,759
(What is he doing there?)

108
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,138
Hello, Jae Seok.

109
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,138
(Jae Seok is the second one to arrive.)

110
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,178
Kwang Soo. What are you doing?

111
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,968
I'm trying to unlock this.

112
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,949
(I think we need to unlock and go inside.)

113
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,201
There's a lock on the doors. This must be where we'll do our opening.

114
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,800
Do you have a number?

115
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:41,159
What do you have?

116
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,888
Mine is a number, but...

117
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:44,918
(Keeping distance for no reason)

118
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,029
(Ji Hyo arrives in the midst of their mind game.)

119
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,100
- Hey, Ji Hyo. - What is it?

120
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,488
Hello.

121
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,129
We're supposed to use the numbers to solve this.

122
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,544
- Let me see. What do you have? - What?

123
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,642
- 139? - 139?

124
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,284
- What do you have? - A minus sign.

125
00:03:55,899 --> 00:03:56,909
You...

126
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
- You should go. - Why would I go?

127
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,638
- You're to be subtracted. - Why would I go?

128
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,838
Why do I have the subtraction sign?

129
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,426
You have a subtraction sign. We should remove him, right?

130
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,909
- This isn't number 11. - Hello.

131
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,021
Wait, this wasn't number 11?

132
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,996
- This isn't number 11. - You're here.

133
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,891
Wait, this wasn't number 11?

134
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,099
Hello.

135
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,018
He... It makes sense now.

136
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,219
- Hey. - What do you have?

137
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,301
- Let me see. - I have subtraction.

138
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,659
- That's not number 11. - Hey.

139
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,358
- I thought I had 11. - That's an equal sign.

140
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,228
- You're unbelievable. - What are we supposed to make?

141
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,552
- We're to calculate numbers. - What are we supposed to make?

142
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,468
- Hey, there's a lock here. - What is this?

143
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,125
- It's not number 11. - There's a 3-digit combo lock.

144
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,727
- What is this? - What do you have?

145
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,338
- Hello. What do you have? - Hi.

146
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:36,693
- What is it? - What's the number on your back?

147
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,809
- We have to calculate numbers. - He has 254.

148
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,708
- I have 254. - What? 254?

149
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,049
I have 88.

150
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,278
What? What's going on?

151
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,330
(Seok Jin has the biggest number.)

152
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,779
(What happens when they put together the numbers and the signs?)

153
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,458
(Is the answer of the calculation the passcode?)

154
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,288
- Let's put this on. Take this off. - Take this off me.

155
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:54,339
Ji Hyo, take this off.

156
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,598
- What is this now? - Let me see.

157
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,458
Jae Seok, Seok Jin's number is too big.

158
00:04:58,459 --> 00:04:59,468
What's this now?

159
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:00,913
It's like the number represents his age.

160
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,569
He's 254 years old.

161
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,317
- First... - We have to put them together.

162
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,739
- In what order should we put them? - Give me that.

163
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,255
- I have 88. - What are we doing?

164
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,038
- 88. - Give me 88.

165
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,059
We're supposed to use the answer for the lock.

166
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,009
Jae Seok, I have the minus sign.

167
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,218
- Give me your minus sign. - How should we use the sign?

168
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,218
(Since they gathered all 8 of the stickers, they must calculate.)

169
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,419
- How should we do this? - The order...

170
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,919
We have to put them in the right order.

171
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,449
(Since they gathered all 8 of the stickers, they must calculate.)

172
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,489
(In what order should we calculate the numbers?)

173
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,600
What's the number?

174
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,013
Do you think the order is based on our age?

175
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,882
(Is it possible that it's in accordance with our age?)

176
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,523
- Put mine and yours. - Is that it?

177
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,069
- Yours is next. - Plus.

178
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,598
- Plus. See? It works out. - Next?

179
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,669
- What about Jong Kook? - What does he have?

180
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,369
- I have 88. - 88.

181
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,708
- Yes, this is correct. This is it. - This is it.

182
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,338
- What about Haha? - Haha.

183
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,009
- I have a plus sign. - Plus sign.

184
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,009
This is the correct order.

185
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,697
- We'll subtract them. - Subtract them.

186
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,249
- Ji Hyo. - This is right.

187
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,379
- So Min. - Se Chan is next.

188
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,966
- What does it come out to? - What's the answer?

189
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,260
254 plus...

190
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,388
(The result of the calculation is 444.)

191
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,470
It's 444.

192
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,679
- It's 444? - 444.

193
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,328
- I... - Why is this 444?

194
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,929
- 444... - Do they want us to die?

195
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,028
I guess someone will be eliminated.

196
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,554
It's 444. I guess someone is going to be removed.

197
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,338
- Hey! - It's open, right?

198
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,380
It was 444?

199
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:15,041
(The passcode was 444.)

200
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:21,151
(The passcode entered was 444.)

201
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,836
Hey, we're doing well today.

202
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,518
- We solved this really quickly. - Hey.

203
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,718
- It was based on our age. - It was our age.

204
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,718
- It was right. - It was our age.

205
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,989
- My gosh, Seok Jin. - Goodness.

206
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,302
- I did it. - That was great.

207
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,689
- You have my respect. - Let me unlock this.

208
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,328
- This is amazing. - Gosh.

209
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,588
How did you figure out it was based on our age?

210
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,104
254 was the biggest number.

211
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,044
- Something feels weird today. - Open it up.

212
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,629
- Hey, let Seok Jin go in first. - It's pitch-dark inside.

213
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,750
(Hold on. What is this?)

214
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:43,499
(Why is it going smoothly today?)

215
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,799
- Hey, let Seok Jin go in first. - It's pitch-dark inside.

216
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,609
(An ominous feeling is never wrong.)

217
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,939
- It's pitch-dark inside. - Hey, hey.

218
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,978
He's dead.

219
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,353
(Someone is dead.)

220
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:52,848
(The truth behind the mysterious room is...)

221
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:54,078
- Is this an escape room? - What is this?

222
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,848
- It's an escape room. - It's an escape room!

223
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,018
It must be an escape room.

224
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,979
(Assistant Director A has faced a mysterious death.)

225
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,449
(What is going on here?)

226
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,732
- Is this an escape room? - What is this?

227
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,518
(They are horrified.)

228
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,028
- It must be an escape room. - What is this?

229
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,433
(The assistant director faced a mysterious death in the room.)

230
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,561
(And mysterious decors are placed in the room.)

231
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,432
(What on earth is this room?)

232
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,531
It's been a while. Look, someone is dead.

233
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,908
- Wait, hold on, everyone. - That...

234
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:24,919
Who is that?

235
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,896
- This is a detective game. - What is this?

236
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,494
(The door is closed down.)

237
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,348
- That startled me. - No!

238
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,249
- Please! Open up! - What?

239
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,518
- Please! Please! - No!

240
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,439
- Hey! - No way.

241
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,571
Try the combination 444 again.

242
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,553
- It doesn't work. - We must find the passcode to exit.

243
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,728
- Hey, today's special... Goodness. - This is about our reasoning skill.

244
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,929
- I love this kind of games. - What is this?

245
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,979
(What is this?)

246
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,699
(In the hands of dead Assistant Director A,)

247
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,239
(there are a piece of paper...)

248
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,139
(and a cassette player.)

249
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,838
- Is it locked? - It's Jigsaw.

250
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,578
- Who killed the assistant director? - Isn't this "Jigsaw"?

251
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:01,879
- Hold on. - The microphone.

252
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,078
Hey, don't touch it.

253
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,735
- Don't touch it. - Don't touch it? Okay.

254
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,162
Don't touch it. Don't.

255
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,489
- Come on. - Don't touch.

256
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,802
- Hey... - Everyone, freeze!

257
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,958
(They start the detective game.)

258
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,088
The culprit might be among us.

259
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:13,388
We shouldn't touch the scene.

260
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:14,929
- Everything is evidence. - I knew he wouldn't last long.

261
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,616
I think we are supposed to do something with this.

262
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,398
We should think about this one at a time.

263
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,629
This is weird.

264
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,487
(Mysterious objects are placed all over the room.)

265
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,598
(What are they for?)

266
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:23,649
What is this?

267
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,169
Jae Seok!

268
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,563
Just like in the movie, "Jigsaw",

269
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,408
- we should play this. - Right.

270
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,560
- You're right. Yes. - Let's play this for now.

271
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,871
- Yes, it happens in "Jigsaw" too. - Exactly.

272
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,717
(They carefully start the cassette player first.)

273
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,019
I am bound to be eliminated.

274
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,434
- What? - Eliminated?

275
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,681
I really wanted to stop the culprit,

276
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,002
but I couldn't in the end.

277
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:49,302
- The culprit? - The culprit?

278
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,590
Dear people who discovered my body.

279
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,747
Please find the culprit...

280
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:57,062
that eliminated me before the sunset.

281
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,868
(The culprit eliminated the assistant director?)

282
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:01,468
- There's a culprit. - The culprit is among us.

283
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02,652
The culprit is among us.

284
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:04,838
It's one of us.

285
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:06,091
(Does that mean it's one of us?)

286
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,580
(The culprit who came up with everything...)

287
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,434
(might be among us.)

288
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:17,448
- There's a culprit. - You can find out how to stop...

289
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,082
the culprit when you go to 319-39, Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu.

290
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:25,377
Haengdang-dong, Seongdong-gu?

291
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,723
- 319-9. - 319-9.

292
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,156
(Hold on.)

293
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,537
(The assistant director was clenching the calendar for March.)

294
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,184
- Hey, this. - The culprit is So Min!

295
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,422
What is this calendar for?

296
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,909
Something is here. It's a calendar.

297
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,404
(It doesn't look different from a regular calendar.)

298
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,531
What's today's date?

299
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,578
- Today is the 12th. - March...

300
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,003
But there is no Monday here.

301
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,419
We film our show on Mondays.

302
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,189
There is a movie called "What Happened to Monday?"

303
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,029
(He gets a hunch.)

304
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,258
- "What Happened to Monday?" - "What Happened to Monday?" Right.

305
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,669
Seok Jin is on a roll today.

306
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,269
Seok Jin, you're doing so well today.

307
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,598
Seok Jin, we have to figure out the secret.

308
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:04,139
(Will they be able to escape in no time at this rate?)

309
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,238
- I'm sorry. - We have to figure out the secret.

310
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,939
(He was amazed at his own reasoning skill.)

311
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,569
(Stepping)

312
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,993
(Wriggling)

313
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,809
- He's smiling. He's alive. - Hey.

314
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,496
- Why did you step on him? - I don't know. I'm sorry.

315
00:10:14,849 --> 00:10:15,848
It must've hurt.

316
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,149
You're not supposed to step on a corpse!

317
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,779
- He might be sleeping. - Seok Jin.

318
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,218
- He's smiling. - Why did you step on him?

319
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,370
- He's smiling though. - He's alive right now.

320
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,333
You shouldn't step on him.

321
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,659
But we can't go to Haengdang-dong from here.

322
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,828
(How can we get to our next mission?)

323
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:29,820
Hey, I think we're supposed to figure out the passcode.

324
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,510
My gosh. This...

325
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:34,918
If we open this up...

326
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,387
- Hey, that's Arabic. - What's this?

327
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,039
- Isn't that Arabic? - No, this is Thai.

328
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,050
Is that Thai?

329
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:43,439
(An indecipherable Thai sentence is hung next to the exit.)

330
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,939
Hey, if we crack this...

331
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,252
Shouldn't we pop it open?

332
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,909
- Hey. - That's from the field day.

333
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,309
- Shouldn't we open that? - Hey.

334
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,549
(A mysterious yellow gourd looks like it may have something inside.)

335
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,679
(And there are beanbags too.)

336
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,205
Hey, there's something over here too!

337
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,588
I found something here!

338
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,189
(There are a transparent cuboid and a small box at a corner.)

339
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,200
It opens up too.

340
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:02,618
(A small box is inside a mysterious and transparent box.)

341
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,299
Hey, let's solve them one at a time!

342
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,399
- Do one at a time. - Yes.

343
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,490
- Let's pop this 1st. - Do 1 at a time.

344
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,310
Pop that.

345
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,881
Throw it.

346
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,868
- Take that! - Gosh.

347
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:15,587
(It opens.)

348
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,754
- It opened! - It popped!

349
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,179
(Something came out of the gourd.)

350
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,449
- They're keys. - What?

351
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,718
- They're two keys. - What are they?

352
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:26,179
- We need to open something. - Where is it?

353
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,319
- What can we open? - Where is it?

354
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,348
Where is it?

355
00:11:28,349 --> 00:11:30,019
- Maybe that one? - What do we have?

356
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,019
(He goes towards the cabinets.)

357
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,628
Open it slowly.

358
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:34,689
It's here.

359
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,749
- Do it slowly. 1 at a time. - 1 at a time.

360
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,199
One at a time.

361
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,868
- One at a time. - That startled me.

362
00:11:40,869 --> 00:11:42,415
What? It opened?

363
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,539
- There's nothing. - Try one at a time.

364
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,639
Do they all open?

365
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,084
This opened.

366
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,663
- What? - Is something inside?

367
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,108
- Was there anything inside? - So Min.

368
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,191
Only the camera was here.

369
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,549
I think it's one of those.

370
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,478
Hold on.

371
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,368
So Min, check the cabinets.

372
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,588
- What is it? - Be calm.

373
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:01,964
Be calm.

374
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,588
The killer is among us!

375
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,478
(He blurts out all of a sudden.)

376
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,189
Goodness.

377
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,228
(Are they filming a movie?)

378
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:09,603
What's with you?

379
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,775
There's English written on this.

380
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,399
(Check this out.)

381
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,628
- What? - "Adam".

382
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:15,728
Bring them here.

383
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,254
- "Nam Jung Seon". - "Rafael".

384
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:18,699
- What? - "Gabriel".

385
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,968
(What are these English names?)

386
00:12:19,969 --> 00:12:22,169
(Seok Jin attempts to open another cabinet.)

387
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,453
- What? - It opened.

388
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,338
(He opens another cabinet.)

389
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,878
It opened. Hey, look.

390
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,208
There's a basketball.

391
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:31,319
(They find a basketball inside.)

392
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,618
- Why is there a basketball? - What can we do with it?

393
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,003
Why is this in here?

394
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:39,189
(What's the use of this basketball?)

395
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,958
Who's the killer? How many of them are in there?

396
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,988
Five basketballs.

397
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,559
(Jae Seok looks around.)

398
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,598
I think we need to take that out.

399
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,929
(There's a box.)

400
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,415
We need to put these balls in there.

401
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,095
(We need to put these balls in there.)

402
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:55,069
(There's an opening in this transparent object.)

403
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,725
- In here? - You're right.

404
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,809
- What do we do? - We should drop it in.

405
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,208
I think we need to break it.

406
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,649
- We need to drop it in. - Right.

407
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,649
- And then grab it. - RIght.

408
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,049
- With our hands. - You're right.

409
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,718
- Like that? - Aim well.

410
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,718
I get it now.

411
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:08,748
(Something breaks.)

412
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,819
- Aim well. - I get it now.

413
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,819
(On his first attempt,)

414
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,961
(he breaks it.)

415
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,628
(The middle lid opens, and a box falls out.)

416
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,477
- Goodness, Jae Seok! - We did it.

417
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,098
- You did it on your first try. - You're amazing.

418
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,238
- I was surprised too. - He sucks at basketball, though.

419
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,639
- It's a phone. - It's a phone.

420
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,368
(They find a phone.)

421
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,939
- This is easier than we thought. - We're doing well.

422
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,030
- We're too quick. - You're right.

423
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,220
- Let's see. - Wait.

424
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,108
It's a translator.

425
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,019
(If it's a translator...)

426
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,118
What is it, Jae Seok?

427
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,765
I think we're supposed to translate this.

428
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,319
Look inside the phone.

429
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,458
(Thai is written next to the exit.)

430
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,689
We have a translator.

431
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,769
(They might be able to translate it.)

432
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,169
What language is this?

433
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,049
- It's Thai. - It's Arabic.

434
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,468
- Is it Thai? - Don't you see that flag?

435
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,571
- The flag is right there. - Sorry.

436
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:02,708
(They attempt to scan the phrase.)

437
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,952
- What is it? - Go a bit back.

438
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,139
That's enough.

439
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,624
- What kind of... - Hey.

440
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,465
- I got it! - What is it?

441
00:14:08,609 --> 00:14:10,265
- Ji Hyo, you're the killer. - Why?

442
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,279
(Why is Ji Hyo being suspected?)

443
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,618
- It's not me. - Why?

444
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:17,518
"There's a password written on Ji Hyo's shoes."

445
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,567
("There's a password written on Ji Hyo's shoes.")

446
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:26,029
(Is there a password on her shoes?)

447
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,323
- Take her shoes off! - Take them off!

448
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:29,410
Take them off!

449
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,868
- Hurry! - Hold her.

450
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:34,809
- It's really not me. - You're the killer.

451
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,478
- It's not me. - She just has a hint on her shoes.

452
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,298
- It's not me. - What is it?

453
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,108
- It's not me. - You're involved in this case.

454
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:44,878
(They find a password.)

455
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,708
- It's here! - I found it!

456
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,419
(The password is found on the sole of her shoe.)

457
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,419
- "301500". - This must be it.

458
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,974
- It was her! - No, it's not me.

459
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,189
(Kwang Soo suspects her.)

460
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,289
- No, it's not me. - Come here.

461
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,199
- I swear. It's not me. - It was you.

462
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,220
- Then what was this? - I have no idea.

463
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,683
Believe me.

464
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:03,123
- I know that you choose your shoes. - It's really not me.

465
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,391
(It opens.)

466
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,639
- What happened? - It opened!

467
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,923
- It opened! - It opened!

468
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,738
(They successfully escape the crime scene.)

469
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,208
- We did it. - It opened.

470
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:15,478
- Let's go to that address. - It opened.

471
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,218
- Let's go. It's that bus. - There's the bus.

472
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:18,449
- You... - It's not me.

473
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,779
Just come with us.

474
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,748
- It's odd that she had the numbers. - Come on.

475
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:22,831
Who knew it'd be her?

476
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,319
I won't trust any one of you.

477
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,988
- It was odd. - It doesn't make sense.

478
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:28,228
- My stylist told me to wear them. - What is this?

479
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,488
- Today... - I can't trust anyone.

480
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:30,842
Ji Hyo.

481
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,616
- You are... - I swear.

482
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,769
Then why were those numbers on your shoe?

483
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,729
- I... - We need to interrogate you.

484
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,797
- It was all fabricated. - Let's find out who the killer is.

485
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:42,569
For the assistant director.

486
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,337
(They promise to avenge for him.)

487
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,309
Jae Seok, if the killer knew...

488
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,369
that we'd be able to escape,

489
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,478
wouldn't it be weird to put the password in their own shoes?

490
00:15:52,479 --> 00:15:53,919
- That's exactly what I mean. - So why were the numbers...

491
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,049
on your shoe?

492
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,858
- My stylist just gave them to me. - You probably met...

493
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:58,910
- the killer. - I suspect someone else more.

494
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,858
- It's Seok Jin. - Why?

495
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:01,858
(Is he the killer?)

496
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,029
- Because he was so quick? - He knew immediately to go...

497
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,899
- by the order of ages. - Right?

498
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,069
- You're right. - The order of ages?

499
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,368
- Right. - That was weird.

500
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:09,799
Let me explain.

501
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,269
(A while back,)

502
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,016
(everyone was confused on how to list the numbers.)

503
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:18,556
(Do you think the order is based on our age?)

504
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,649
(Looking at the formula, he guessed that it was by age.)

505
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,376
I guessed so because I noticed that my number was the biggest.

506
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,949
And I saw a minus too,

507
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,689
so I thought we'd start with my number first.

508
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,118
That's how I got the age part.

509
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,988
If you're not the killer, you have psychic powers.

510
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,358
(If you're not the killer, you have psychic powers.)

511
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,689
- Seok Jin. - Oh, come on.

512
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,376
You're one of the prime suspects.

513
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:37,509
Look at this.

514
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:39,648
- The assistant director was killed. - Right.

515
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:40,879
Why do you think so?

516
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:42,769
One of us must've been unhappy about the editing.

517
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,669
(Editing is an assistant director's main task.)

518
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,791
(Which one of them is the most unhappy?)

519
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,108
It's one of us.

520
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,708
- Doesn't it make sense? - It does.

521
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,578
- It does, right? - Then...

522
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,708
- It makes sense. - Come to think of it,

523
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:54,909
- One of us was very unhappy... - you're right.

524
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,309
- about the way he edited things. - Then...

525
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,978
- isn't it Seok Jin? - Exactly.

526
00:16:57,979 --> 00:16:59,118
That's why I'm suspecting him.

527
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,848
- That makes sense. - Yes.

528
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,032
That's why...

529
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,159
I think he is the prime suspect.

530
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,389
I wish it were me.

531
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,488
(While everyone has their eyes on Seok Jin...)

532
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,904
I truly wish it were me.

533
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,958
- Someone was very unhappy. - I wish I was the killer.

534
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,298
(Is he really the killer?)

535
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:14,309
Hold on.

536
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,713
Hey, did you take off your hoodie?

537
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,169
- What? - Everyone's has it.

538
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,468
Kwang Soo isn't.

539
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:20,508
- What? - Why aren't you wearing one?

540
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:24,176
(Why isn't he wearing a hoodie?)

541
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,639
- He's not? - Look.

542
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,902
- Why don't you have one? - What is going on?

543
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,008
- I just tucked it inside. - You're trying to show off.

544
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,748
- I tucked it in for no reason. - Why?

545
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,018
- I can take it out. - Wait.

546
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,636
Let us see.

547
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,131
Are you wearing something different?

548
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,875
- Let me see. - There's nothing inside.

549
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,389
- What? - I'm so frustrated.

550
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,429
Remove his name tag.

551
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,788
- Why would you? - Remove it.

552
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:42,929
- You can't. - Should I?

553
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,958
He says no.

554
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,829
(Kwang Soo suddenly panics.)

555
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,041
- We can't? - He says no.

556
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,498
- No? - Why not?

557
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,169
(It's not even a race, so why not?)

558
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,260
Removing it means I'm out.

559
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,839
- No. - No.

560
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,031
- We're not having a race. - Something smells fishy in here.

561
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,928
He's hiding something.

562
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,379
- I know. - No.

563
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,227
- He didn't let us remove it. - He tucked his clothes in.

564
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,208
I used to be Sherlock, you see.

565
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,379
- What do you mean? - Jae Seok isn't the killer today.

566
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,149
- I used to be Sherlock. - He reads many detective novels.

567
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,419
(He did once play the role of Sherlock.)

568
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,065
The aged detective, Nose!

569
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,159
(It's a new character.)

570
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,288
- Nose. - Nose.

571
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:16,643
I am Detective Nose.

572
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:17,829
He's Detective Nose!

573
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,071
Detective Nose.

574
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,051
He sniffs around the crime scenes.

575
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,158
- He doesn't talk at all. - He just sniffs around.

576
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,040
He only smells. He charges 35 dollars per 30 minutes.

577
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,508
- That's a unique character. - He charges 35 dollars...

578
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:33,611
per 30 minutes. He's only there to sniff.

579
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,097
- Detective Nose. - That's adorable.

580
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,297
- Where's the calendar? - Did you bring the calander?

581
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,518
- "Calander"? - "Calander"?

582
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,731
Seok Jin must've brought it.

583
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,949
Really?

584
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,988
- How suspicious. - Let's look at it right now.

585
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,514
Goodness. There is no Monday.

586
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,958
I really enjoyed that movie.

587
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,988
March?

588
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,429
(What's the meaning behind this calendar?)

589
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,025
If you add the dates on Mondays, it sounds like "older brother".

590
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,180
Why?

591
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,218
The sum is 58. It sounds like "older brother".

592
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,789
- Maybe the killer was born in 1958. - Let's see.

593
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,581
- Who was born in 1958? - It's 58.

594
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,597
Seok Jin was born in 1966.

595
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,978
- Jong Kook was born in 1977. - 1977.

596
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,060
- No, 1976. - 1976.

597
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,849
- I was born in 1985. - Okay.

598
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,909
(Seok Jin: 1966, Jong Kook: 1976, Kwang Soo: 1985)

599
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,179
Wait. 85 backwards is 58.

600
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,119
(58 is the sum of the dates on Mondays.)

601
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,689
Exactly. That's why he's suspicious.

602
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,458
- That's enough. - Hey.

603
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,458
(He's enraged.)

604
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,629
(Everyone suspects him.)

605
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,701
- It's you, isn't it? - No.

606
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,159
- It's you again. - You're suspecting me...

607
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,159
- It's you, right? - just because of the year?

608
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,715
- 58 backward is 85. - It's not me.

609
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,228
- I promise that... - You're my older brother.

610
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,087
- This doesn't... What? - You're my older brother.

611
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,339
- You are. - What in the world are you saying?

612
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,669
(Is the calendar really pointing at him?)

613
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,963
Judging by everything that we talked about,

614
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,237
Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, and Ji Hyo...

615
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,839
- Not me. - are highly suspicious.

616
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,649
Just because I tucked in...

617
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,660
Be quiet.

618
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,290
He wants him to shut it.

619
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,119
He is suspicious.

620
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,806
- He's linked to 58. - He is.

621
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:50,975
We're headed to a restaurant.

622
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,303
- I guess we're having lunch. - Really?

623
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:55,376
- That sounds wonderful. - Seriously?

624
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:58,016
Hey. Look!

625
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,228
We're having pollack.

626
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,629
(They'll be going to a pollack restaurant.)

627
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,798
- It sounds like "nose". - It's Seok Jin.

628
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,819
And it's the Wangsimni branch!

629
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:07,654
- Big Nose! - Big Nose!

630
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:11,098
- Big Nose! - Seriously?

631
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,308
- Hey! - This is certain!

632
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,548
How could you?

633
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,149
Why did you have to come to Wangsimni?

634
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,748
- It's definitely him. - It's you, right?

635
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,278
- A pollack restaurant in Wangsimni? - It's not me.

636
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,018
- It's Seok Jin. - It's not me.

637
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,288
- It's Seok Jin. - Wow, it really...

638
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,458
- does make sense. - Big Nose!

639
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,945
- This isn't right. - Big Nose!

640
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,758
What kind of hint is that?

641
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,528
- It's you. - We caught the killer!

642
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,058
This is a pollack restaurant in Wangsimni.

643
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:33,399
(Is this really a hint?)

644
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,086
- It's seriously not me. - If you eat pollack today,

645
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,169
- it'll definitely be you. - We're not having pollack.

646
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,512
I'm quite keen, you know?

647
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:39,599
You know, right?

648
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,073
(Everyone enters the restaurant while being certain that it's him.)

649
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,326
Is there a hint here?

650
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,609
- It's here. - I think it is.

651
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,033
If we order pollack, you're definitely the killer.

652
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,919
- We need to keep an eye on him. - It's not me.

653
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,970
(They can't find any hints.)

654
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,159
- There must be a hint here. - We need to have our eyes peeled.

655
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,258
- Hey. - That's good.

656
00:20:58,259 --> 00:20:59,318
What is this?

657
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,389
The food is already served.

658
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,389
- Food is served? - Really? Let me see.

659
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,389
Hey, look.

660
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,429
(There's food on the table.)

661
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,379
- I see three baby octopuses. - What?

662
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:07,629
- It's a long-legged octopus. - There's duck.

663
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,275
(There's no pollack but duck meat and long-legged octopus.)

664
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,599
It's 100g of duck meat and 70g of long-legged octopus.

665
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,781
(Their weight and calories are written.)

666
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,538
- What is this? - It's long-legged octopus.

667
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,808
- Maybe it's about the calories. - Wait.

668
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,808
It's long-legged octopus?

669
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,496
- Hey. - Where are their legs?

670
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:21,924
This is long-legged octopus?

671
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:23,308
- But where are their legs? - They don't have any legs.

672
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:24,633
They're missing their legs.

673
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:26,261
- It's... - Goodness.

674
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,966
Do you know why they're called long-legged octopus?

675
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,189
- Why? - They have thin legs.

676
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,047
(The octopus has thin legs.)

677
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,359
- It's you. - What?

678
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,599
- It's nonsensical. - Hold on.

679
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,798
- Right? - Yes.

680
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,345
- Look at his legs. - Come on.

681
00:21:40,469 --> 00:21:42,028
- Look. - Wait.

682
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,998
- Look at his legs. - It's not me.

683
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:46,099
- Put him down. - Hold on.

684
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,869
(There must be a hint somewhere around his legs.)

685
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,980
Gosh!

686
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:51,738
Look at this.

687
00:21:51,739 --> 00:21:54,437
He's not wearing socks. They look like stockings.

688
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,801
- Hey, how far will you go? - Look at his legs.

689
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,119
- Is there anything there? - How far are you rolling them?

690
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,260
- No. - No?

691
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,689
- There's nothing there. - I see.

692
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,335
- Really? - There's nothing.

693
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,580
We should look into the octopus.

694
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:07,528
- There are three of them. - What is that?

695
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:08,944
They're missing their legs.

696
00:22:08,989 --> 00:22:10,758
The answer is in here.

697
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,851
We need to figure this out.

698
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,489
(It read, "Enjoy", alongside their weight and calories.)

699
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,298
Shouldn't we eat them first?

700
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:22,308
- Yes, maybe it's inside. - Yes.

701
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:23,319
Maybe.

702
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,208
Do I need to eat this duck meat?

703
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:27,679
There are no dips or sauces.

704
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,468
Don't eat it.

705
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:30,894
He ate it.

706
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,248
- Aren't we supposed to? - Is it good?

707
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:33,289
Is it raw?

708
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,349
- It's raw. - First,

709
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,518
let's eat it.

710
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,558
(It says to enjoy it.)

711
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,089
Try them.

712
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,758
(Nervous and curious, they decide to eat it.)

713
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,769
It's good.

714
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,199
(Detective Nose sniffs around.)

715
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,614
Try some.

716
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,083
- I already had it. - Have one more.

717
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:51,298
It's good.

718
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:52,582
(There's nothing strange about it.)

719
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,208
100g and 70g.

720
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:56,439
(What do their weight and calories mean?)

721
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,450
169.

722
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,681
(Surrounded by nervousness, they finish eating.)

723
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,397
Shouldn't we leave now?

724
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:06,079
Where should we go?

725
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,373
There's nowhere to go since we don't have any leads.

726
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,015
Maybe we should link this with that calendar.

727
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:12,718
Let me check this box.

728
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,359
(All that they see are the food and the menu.)

729
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,510
- Let's go outside for now. - Really?

730
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,998
There's nothing else in here.

731
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,669
We did enjoy the food.

732
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,839
Hold on. The rooms are all covered.

733
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,869
She's right. They're all covered.

734
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,778
(At a glance, they looked like ordinary rooms.)

735
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:32,339
They have marks on them.

736
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,733
(Each room has the Running Man mark.)

737
00:23:35,209 --> 00:23:37,318
That's right. Let's go there.

738
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,066
- Let's go. - Hold on.

739
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,149
(Jae Seok walks towards the main entrance.)

740
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,149
What is this?

741
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,649
- What? - What is it?

742
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,159
- What is it, Jae Seok? - What is it?

743
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,159
(What stopped him in his tracks?)

744
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,775
- What is it? - He found something.

745
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,599
What do 169 calories mean?

746
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,671
(A calorie calculator is in front of the door.)

747
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:54,597
(And it read 169kcal.)

748
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,502
(The entrance is locked.)

749
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,864
(What do 169 calories mean?)

750
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,508
- Hey. - I think we need to subtract...

751
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,106
- how much we ate. - I see.

752
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,649
(They read "enjoy" and decided to eat the food.)

753
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,932
(The door will only open once the calculator reads 0.)

754
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:21,624
- We ate 169 calories of food. - Right.

755
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,429
We need to burn the calories.

756
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,075
- Darn it. - What is it?

757
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,948
I think every room has something we can use for it.

758
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,468
- Should we not have eaten them? - Maybe there are workout machines.

759
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:32,738
(Do the rooms offer ways to burn calories?)

760
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,861
The doors are closed.

761
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,499
We're allowed to go inside.

762
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,038
What is this?

763
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,548
(He spots something inside.)

764
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,149
- Is someone in there? - There's something inside.

765
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,248
(They find a mysterious, white box.)

766
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,239
- There's something in every room. - There's something in here.

767
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,889
We need to do something.

768
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,466
(What is that box?)

769
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:52,707
(He opens it.)

770
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,129
(There are objects inside.)

771
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,140
Look.

772
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,640
Are those watches?

773
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,669
If you place it on the phone, it charges the watch.

774
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,998
(There are 8 watches, and 1 of them is being charged.)

775
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,029
"Wear the watches, and you'll be able to read how much you burn."

776
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,538
We need to wear them and do something.

777
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:11,236
(Their first mission is to wear the watches.)

778
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,308
I think we just need to burn 169 calories.

779
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:16,478
It shows up like this.

780
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,267
- Do we have to go next door? - Hey.

781
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,149
- We need to burn calories. - Let's go.

782
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,260
Shall we go next door?

783
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,258
(They go to R2. What's in there?)

784
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:25,419
40 to 42?

785
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,854
(They go to R2. What's in there?)

786
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,777
What does 40 to 42 mean?

787
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,974
(Jae Seok spots something.)

788
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,639
This will help us burn calories.

789
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,599
- Is it food? - "Follow me."

790
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,169
"If you successfully mimic the video,"

791
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,825
"you'll burn 60 calories."

792
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,639
- I know what this is. - There are...

793
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,973
various songs here.

794
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,349
There's also Sean Lee.

795
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,619
(They should pick the easiest one.)

796
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,731
Let's burn 60 calories with "Bboom Bboom".

797
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:56,288
"Bboom Bboom".

798
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,288
(They need to follow the dance moves.)

799
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,299
"Complete".

800
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:59,829
It's working.

801
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:01,028
(The video turns on.)

802
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,251
Hey, we need to dance.

803
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,376
- We need to mimic them? - Yes.

804
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,758
- Goodness. - Let's do it.

805
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,968
- So Min, come out. - Let's do it.

806
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,222
- Let's do it. - Go, So Min.

807
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,768
(The choreography is hard.)

808
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,557
This is hard.

809
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,251
(So Min and Ji Hyo are doing well.)

810
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,728
(Everyone successfully mimics the "bboom bboom" part.)

811
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,119
- They're really good. - They are.

812
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,573
- They're good. - It's too quick.

813
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,012
(Meanwhile, they're struggling.)

814
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:33,749
(They cannot control their limbs.)

815
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:37,158
(These two are the best.)

816
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,629
(Thanks to them, they've burned 15 calories so far.)

817
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,829
- Let's go. - Get ready.

818
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,199
- Burn those calories! - Let's do it!

819
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,552
Make sure to do this.

820
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,317
(Everyone does the "finger bragging" dance move.)

821
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,169
(Jae Seok mimics very well.)

822
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,027
(They're burning many calories.)

823
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,971
(You're doing well.)

824
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:58,347
(They're burning the calories they ingested while eating.)

825
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,737
(They try their best to burn the calories.)

826
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,788
(They regret eating.)

827
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,901
This is tiring.

828
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,051
Seok Jin, are you a dinosaur?

829
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:12,697
(His dance moves remind them of a dinosaur.)

830
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,129
Let's go!

831
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:19,392
(They need to do well until the end to succeed.)

832
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:22,308
(They've given their all to the choreography.)

833
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,824
(Exhausted, they finish dancing.)

834
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,123
60 calories.

835
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,308
Let's find out.

836
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,409
Did we burn it?

837
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,048
- This is tiring. - Let's go to the next room.

838
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:35,419
(So Min goes to check how much they've burned.)

839
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,430
109 calories?

840
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:39,587
Wait, hold on. Guys!

841
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,528
It reads 109 calories now. It changed.

842
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:43,558
- It went down. - It read 109 calories now.

843
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:45,629
- Okay. - That's how much we have left.

844
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,028
- Shall we go next door? - Let's do that.

845
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,019
- Let's go. - Let's go.

846
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:51,099
- Why do we have to do this? - What's going on?

847
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,563
Who's responsible for torturing us like this?

848
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,558
- I shouldn't have eaten. - What?

849
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,478
You're right.

850
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,055
Let's leave this.

851
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:04,349
(What awaits them in R3?)

852
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,036
- This is interesting. - I'm so hot.

853
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:07,818
There are balloons.

854
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,618
(Startled)

855
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,415
- I guess we need to pop them. - Look.

856
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:14,901
We need to jump.

857
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:17,820
- We'll burn 50 calories. - Hey.

858
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,768
We need to jump and pop them.

859
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:23,199
Kwang Soo can do it. Kwang Soo, you need to do something.

860
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,887
- I do? - Yes.

861
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,292
- Come here, beanpole. - Hurry up.

862
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,169
- Hey. - Gosh.

863
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,208
- We need your help. - What is this?

864
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:33,339
It's worth 50 calories.

865
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,763
- It's worth 50 calories. - Pop them all.

866
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,870
I'm so glad we have a beanpole.

867
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:39,039
- It's all up to you. - You'll burn 50 calories.

868
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,543
- Let's go, beanpole. - We'll burn 50 calories.

869
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,048
That one has flour in it.

870
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,189
(He starts popping them.)

871
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,512
- Be careful of the flour. - Don't pop the flour.

872
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,292
(You're doing well, Kwang Soo.)

873
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,929
Goodness. He's good.

874
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:55,555
(He's having a party.)

875
00:28:55,999 --> 00:28:57,199
(He was born to do this.)

876
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,639
- You're doing so well. - Way to go.

877
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,909
- Good job. - Am I doing this alone?

878
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,930
(He's getting exhausted.)

879
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,522
- You're doing well. - It's just you.

880
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,804
- Good. - Switch after popping 10.

881
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,300
Okay. Good, Kwang Soo. You can stop.

882
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,633
Go, So Min.

883
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,331
- Me? Can I reach that high? - Go.

884
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,379
What's important is that you burn calories.

885
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,818
- Jong Kook. - Okay.

886
00:29:19,819 --> 00:29:21,458
(Jong Kook happily agrees to help.)

887
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,589
- Let's do this. - I won't be able to reach them.

888
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,316
Use him to jump.

889
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,998
Yes, do that.

890
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:27,798
Go. No, not like that.

891
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,429
- No, let me. - Jong Kook.

892
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,899
Come here. Do it.

893
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,369
(He's a gentleman.)

894
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,490
- I'm heavy. - Get ready. One...

895
00:29:34,569 --> 00:29:35,923
1, 2, 3.

896
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,478
(I'll pick you up.)

897
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,226
(Popping)

898
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,278
(Flying)

899
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,278
Watch out.

900
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,179
(It looks romantic in slow motion.)

901
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,740
(You're the best, Jong Kook.)

902
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,533
Are you all right?

903
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,558
- I flew. - Are you okay?

904
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,958
Love is in the air.

905
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,988
I flew.

906
00:29:56,989 --> 00:29:58,298
(Thanks to him, she pops 1.)

907
00:29:58,299 --> 00:29:59,946
- Hold on. - Which one's the lowest?

908
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,998
- This will take ages. - That one's low.

909
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:03,514
How long will this take?

910
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,798
(They need to pop all of them. They've burned 13 calories so far.)

911
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,850
Where is it?

912
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:10,238
Can I just do it?

913
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:12,879
(He's frustrated.)

914
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,179
- I'll just pop them all. - All right.

915
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,190
Okay.

916
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,623
Just keep jumping around.

917
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:17,991
Let's burn all 109 calories.

918
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,889
It's best for him to do it since he's the tallest.

919
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,349
(He keeps his eye on the target.)

920
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,400
(He pops two at once.)

921
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:25,089
(He's on a roll.)

922
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,605
He popped two at once.

923
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,043
He's so tall.

924
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,458
(They're impressed by him.)

925
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,682
Try two at once again. That was cool.

926
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,568
(He's proud of himself.)

927
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,751
(Let me pop some more.)

928
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,556
- That's good. - You're doing well.

929
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,998
- Good. - Good job.

930
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,524
- He's the best. - Good job.

931
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,488
Hurry up. We have no time.

932
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,400
Okay, I'll help you. 1, 2, 3.

933
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:47,759
- Okay. - Good.

934
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,208
1... 1, 2, 3.

935
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:50,609
(Everyone helps him out.)

936
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,630
1, 2, 3.

937
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,672
- He's exhausted. - 1, 2, 3.

938
00:30:54,989 --> 00:30:55,988
Okay.

939
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:57,548
- Jump again. - Goodness.

940
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,488
- 1, 2, 3. - Good job.

941
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:01,189
- 1, 2, 3. - Nice.

942
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:04,189
- Hey, just use a stick. - Let's go Kwang Soo.

943
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,798
(Just use a stick.)

944
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,998
- You look like a stick. - Use a stick.

945
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,848
You're a stick. You're.

946
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,099
Kwang Soo, do it.

947
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,786
- You should do it. - You're a stick.

948
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,283
- Kwang Soo, 1, 2, 3. - You're a stick.

949
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,839
Put him right under. 1, 2, 3.

950
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,409
(A human stick? I will accept it.)

951
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,579
(The human stick hits the target for 100 percent.)

952
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,296
- Stand at the back. - 1, 2, 3.

953
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,127
Keep your head raised. We'll do it for you.

954
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:23,508
There you go.

955
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,048
(Kwang Soo acquired a character unprecedented in history.)

956
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,059
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

957
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,762
- No, there. - Here.

958
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:30,919
(They consumed 40 calories.)

959
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,058
There's a cluster. Let's pop 3 of them at 1 go.

960
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,788
- How about hitting 3 at 1 go? - I'm not going to lower my head.

961
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,143
We have only about a dozen left.

962
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,758
Kwang Soo, you're really awesome.

963
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:39,011
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

964
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,822
(He hit the ceiling.)

965
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,968
(He hit the ceiling again.)

966
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,989
- Keep holding him. - Wait a minute.

967
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,008
I'm hitting my head on the ceiling.

968
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,079
(Please be careful.)

969
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,595
Okay. Okay.

970
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,208
- We can do it. - Okay.

971
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:55,808
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

972
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:58,546
(The human stick resumes working.)

973
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,179
(He hits the target without a mistake.)

974
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,200
He got the hang of it.

975
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,119
Good. Good. Okay. Good job.

976
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,389
He's certainly improving. He improved.

977
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,470
He doesn't miss.

978
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,129
You got the hang of it.

979
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,362
(The human stick got the hang of it.)

980
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,929
- Good job. - Great work.

981
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,920
(We only have 2 left now.)

982
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,568
(The last 2 balloons pop out.)

983
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:23,064
(He took care of all the balloons.)

984
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,793
You got the hang of it.

985
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,778
- Good job. - Kwang Soo put a lot of effort.

986
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,789
It was great.

987
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,470
Jae Seok. It's 59 calories.

988
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,132
Do we still have calories left?

989
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:35,919
Shall we go to the next room?

990
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,159
- It's hard to lift him up. - It's hard.

991
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,382
- Kwang Soo and... - We'll go out.

992
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,389
(The human stick is deserted after the balloons are popped.)

993
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,783
I can't do this. I can't.

994
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,981
What's left now?

995
00:32:49,229 --> 00:32:50,715
- We need to burn more calories. - Where do we go?

996
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,768
(They have 59 calories left.)

997
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:58,409
(Only R4 is left.)

998
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,478
- There's another room. - There's one more.

999
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,949
- It's here. - There's one more.

1000
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,179
- There it is. - It's here.

1001
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,260
It's here.

1002
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,879
- What's this? - What's this?

1003
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,203
It's water.

1004
00:33:08,489 --> 00:33:10,570
We did more than 100 calories, and we have 59 calories left.

1005
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,111
Jae Seok, do we need to hold out for 50 seconds?

1006
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:14,846
Yes, 50 seconds. No, 60 seconds.

1007
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,755
You need to lie face down and hold the ball.

1008
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,657
We'll play Race of Wits, and the last one... You know.

1009
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,829
- Okay. - Let's...

1010
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,528
- The last might not have to do it. - Right.

1011
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,498
Let's start.

1012
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,064
(The Race of Wits begins.)

1013
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,272
(Se Chan and Jo Hyo lose.)

1014
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,325
Okay. Two of you play rock-paper-scissors.

1015
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:38,048
Rock-paper-scissors.

1016
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,318
(Se Chan wins.)

1017
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,401
Ji Hyo.

1018
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,548
- Ji Hyo. - Ji Hyo.

1019
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:43,988
(Ji Hyo challenges holding out on the gym ball for 10 seconds.)

1020
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,404
If you hold out for 60 seconds, we're done.

1021
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:47,419
- You can hold out for 60 seconds. - If Ji Hyo makes it, we're done.

1022
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,570
If she holds out for 60 seconds, we're done.

1023
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:51,184
- Ji Hyo can do it. - Go up on the ball.

1024
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,929
- Hold out! - Hold out!

1025
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,228
- Ji Hyo. - Please.

1026
00:33:54,229 --> 00:33:56,468
- It won't be easy to hold out here. - It won't be easy.

1027
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,085
We have 59 calories left now.

1028
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,439
- You shouldn't hold there. - I shouldn't?

1029
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,722
Get balance.

1030
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,283
You can say "Start".

1031
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,926
It will be better to keep your legs up.

1032
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,579
- Here you go. - Let's...

1033
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,149
You need to hold the ball like this.

1034
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,278
I'll hold your hands and let go when you start.

1035
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,379
(Everyone is extremely focused in the last room.)

1036
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,619
- Let's... - Get balance.

1037
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,619
I'm ready.

1038
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,235
- I'll let go when you tell me. - I'm ready.

1039
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,659
- Ready. Go. - It's good.

1040
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,959
(Ji Hyo challenges for holding out for 10 seconds.)

1041
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,488
(They consume calories as much as they hold out on the gym ball.)

1042
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,904
Just a little more!

1043
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:24,028
Good.

1044
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,515
It's a lot of exercises, I guess.

1045
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,599
She's doing great.

1046
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,943
(She narrowly keeps balance.)

1047
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,281
She can do it.

1048
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:32,688
(She's suddenly dancing.)

1049
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,738
(Ji Hyo escapes the crisis with dance.)

1050
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,508
(She's the best player.)

1051
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:37,852
Seven... She's good.

1052
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:40,803
(She succeeds if she holds out for 5 more seconds.)

1053
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,263
- She's doing good. - Right...

1054
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,891
(She puts her hands on the pool.)

1055
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:45,648
(Ji Hyo succeeds in holding out for 10 seconds.)

1056
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:47,235
- 10 seconds. - She's good.

1057
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,548
- 10 seconds. - 10 calories.

1058
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:50,438
- Okay. - We consumed a lot.

1059
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,258
It was hectic.

1060
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:53,431
- We have 49 calories left. - Nice.

1061
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,900
Se Chan.

1062
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,279
Start. It's cold.

1063
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,571
Se Chan, focus.

1064
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,740
You can do it.

1065
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,920
Se Chan, you're athletic.

1066
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,769
Ready. Go.

1067
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,838
(Se Chan begins holding out for 10 seconds.)

1068
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,849
He can do it.

1069
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:08,284
- He can do it. - There you go.

1070
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,961
- Good. Good. - He can do it well.

1071
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,139
What's that?

1072
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,438
(What?)

1073
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,773
(Dancing)

1074
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,349
Is he performing a circus?

1075
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,749
(He's dancing cheerfully all of a sudden.)

1076
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,890
(Falling in the water)

1077
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,148
(He succeeds holding out for 11 seconds with a traditional dance.)

1078
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:25,574
- It's cold! - It's all right.

1079
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,019
How many seconds?

1080
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,655
(They have 39 calories left.)

1081
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,329
Is it hard?

1082
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,046
- Go ahead, Haha. - Try it.

1083
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,957
It's because it has too much air inside.

1084
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,238
I'll let go of your hands after I balance.

1085
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:40,058
(I'll show you the dignity of my experience of 10 years.)

1086
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,391
- Good. Good. - He can make it.

1087
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,709
Nice.

1088
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,336
(You can do it this way if you want to make it funny.)

1089
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:48,749
(He seemed to balance.)

1090
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,831
- This looks the stablest. - He can make it.

1091
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:54,150
(He's bowing down.)

1092
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,318
(Haha fails in holding out for 10 seconds.)

1093
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,688
- This is hard. - It's hard.

1094
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,119
- Can't you do it? - Please be seated.

1095
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,459
(The calory meter doesn't move.)

1096
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,701
Look at me. We can't do this sitting on it.

1097
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:05,329
Yes, the frog. There you go.

1098
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,528
- Okay. - I should have got on it like that.

1099
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:08,128
- It would work. - Look.

1100
00:36:08,129 --> 00:36:09,128
- That's it. - Take off your hands.

1101
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:10,869
Good. Now you can just balance.

1102
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,738
We just need to keep our limbs apart from the ball, right?

1103
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:14,659
(We just need to keep our limbs apart from the ball, right?)

1104
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,392
- I'll do it. I will. - Why?

1105
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,909
We just need to keep our limbs apart from the ball, right?

1106
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,309
- Do you know what limbs are? - I do.

1107
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,865
- It means arms and legs. - Right.

1108
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:24,378
Look at me. Then... Look.

1109
00:36:24,379 --> 00:36:25,778
(Haha makes a pose with confidence.)

1110
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,093
Haha.

1111
00:36:27,149 --> 00:36:28,534
- Here I go. - Haha.

1112
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,459
(Is he suddenly washing his hair?)

1113
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,488
Here I go.

1114
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:33,772
- Ready. Go. - Go.

1115
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,929
(The moment he wets his hair,)

1116
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,202
(he falls into the water.)

1117
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:38,599
Go. One...

1118
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,229
(He tried a new pose.)

1119
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,729
(But he failed in 2 seconds.)

1120
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,528
- My goodness. - That doesn't work.

1121
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:46,287
Wouldn't it work if I do it with my face down?

1122
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,355
Someone can try it with face down.

1123
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,857
- Put your head down. - What are you doing?

1124
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,838
Try putting your head down.

1125
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,071
- Here goes So Min. - You can put your head down?

1126
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,271
It's a frog. It's exactly a pose of a frog.

1127
00:36:57,379 --> 00:36:58,648
Goodness, you're putting your head into the water.

1128
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,468
Why are you doing it? Why?

1129
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,818
(I'll wash my hair too.)

1130
00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:05,358
Wait a minute. I'll give it a try.

1131
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,889
- She can do it. - She can make it.

1132
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,010
It's because she's light in weight. Just take your arms off the ball.

1133
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,269
Ready. Go.

1134
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,156
- She can do it. - 1, 2, 3.

1135
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,668
She just fell down.

1136
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,083
- She will get all wet. - So Min.

1137
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:19,464
(So Min fails in holding out for 10 seconds.)

1138
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:20,838
I'm sorry.

1139
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,238
(I washed my hair.)

1140
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,249
I'm sorry.

1141
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,479
I'll start right away. I got it.

1142
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,108
- Put your head into the water. - Go ahead.

1143
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:29,100
(Kwang Soo gets ready to hold out washing his hair.)

1144
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,749
(He looks somewhat stable.)

1145
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,979
- He can make it. - Kwang Soo can do it.

1146
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,619
(They still have 49 calories left due to continuing failure.)

1147
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,073
- He's going to make it. - Ready.

1148
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,802
go. Okay. One...

1149
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:40,559
2, 3...

1150
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,729
(He shows different stability.)

1151
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,245
We made it. Seven...

1152
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:46,298
(He looks most comfortable as if he's an aquatic creature.)

1153
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:48,491
- We made it. - 1, 2...

1154
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,785
(He's truly amazing.)

1155
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:52,999
(Go for it, Kwang Soo.)

1156
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,468
- 12, 13... - He made it.

1157
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:56,157
(He succeeds in consuming 10 calories.)

1158
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,452
- All right. - You made it.

1159
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,209
(He deeply cleanses his scalp too.)

1160
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,027
- Kwang Soo, you made it. - You did it.

1161
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:03,949
- You did it. - You made it.

1162
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,960
(Kwang Soo, you made it.)

1163
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,548
- Good. - He made it, right?

1164
00:38:07,549 --> 00:38:08,933
- He made it. - He did it.

1165
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:10,789
How many seconds?

1166
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,188
- We have 29 calories left. - We have just a little left.

1167
00:38:13,189 --> 00:38:14,659
- Jae Seok, it's 29 calories left. - We need to do it 3 times more.

1168
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,204
We need to succeed three more times.

1169
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,904
I'll try it sideways.

1170
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,159
- A human body is twisted. - Exactly.

1171
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,179
Right.

1172
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,369
Ready. Go.

1173
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,490
- 1, 2, 3... - He can make it.

1174
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,312
4, 5...

1175
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,326
6, 7...

1176
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:31,068
Are you all right?

1177
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:32,238
Are you all right, Jae Seok?

1178
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,623
(He's amazing.)

1179
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,108
(He already became one with the ball.)

1180
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:38,008
- This is nice. - Jae Seok.

1181
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:41,449
(Jae Seok also succeeds in consuming 10 calories.)

1182
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,560
What's going on?

1183
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:43,860
How did he do it?

1184
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,775
- How did you do it? - What was that?

1185
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,045
- How could he do it? - I made it.

1186
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:49,876
I sat sideways.

1187
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,289
Sideways.

1188
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,845
Everyone has own balance.

1189
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,168
I could do it with my own balance.

1190
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,628
(Haha without any success tries.)

1191
00:38:56,629 --> 00:38:58,286
Move your body a little bit like this.

1192
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,199
- Jae Seok made it perfectly. - I did it perfectly.

1193
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,522
He was perfect.

1194
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:03,938
Here I go.

1195
00:39:03,939 --> 00:39:06,000
(Haha challenges with a sitting sideway strategy.)

1196
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,979
3, 4...

1197
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,749
(If Haha makes a success,)

1198
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,072
(they only have 9 calories left.)

1199
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,179
Just a little bit more.

1200
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,048
(If he focuses a little more,)

1201
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:16,736
(he can make a success.)

1202
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,619
(Haha who followed Jae Seok's way of sitting sideways...)

1203
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,889
(succeeds in consuming 10 calories.)

1204
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,229
Great.

1205
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,028
- We only have 9 calories left. - 9 calories.

1206
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,474
You need to sit sideways. Sideways.

1207
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,929
- Seok Jin, go see it. - Okay.

1208
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,011
What does the meter say?

1209
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,589
9, 9. It says 9 calories.

1210
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,438
- Everyone has own pose to succeed. - Okay.

1211
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,035
- Se Chan. - I think that will work.

1212
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,020
Trust yourself.

1213
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,266
You need to balance moving a little bit.

1214
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,648
1, 2...

1215
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:46,094
(Se Chan starts, keeping the momentum.)

1216
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,789
(If Se Chan succeeds, they can escape right away.)

1217
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,218
7, 8...

1218
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:53,918
(They only have 9 calories left.)

1219
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:56,717
(They need to succeed just one more time.)

1220
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,199
(Can he make a success?)

1221
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,643
- 9, 10. - Okay.

1222
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,429
I think I can do it some more.

1223
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,540
(He holds out for 10 seconds and makes a success.)

1224
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,221
- I think I can do it some more. - Okay. Okay.

1225
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:09,290
- Okay. - I got the hang of it.

1226
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:10,508
- Okay. - That was nice.

1227
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,995
- It was perfect. - It was good, Se Chan.

1228
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,121
- Okay. - We made it.

1229
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,309
(The calory meter points to 0.)

1230
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,794
- Let's go! - Let's go.

1231
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,144
We're done, right? We can escape.

1232
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:24,341
- Let's get out. - Let's go.

1233
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:25,918
- Are we locked again? - It's opening.

1234
00:40:25,919 --> 00:40:27,910
- It's zero calories now. - What's going on today?

1235
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,503
What's going on today?

1236
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:34,090
- It wasn't pollack. - It wasn't.

1237
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:37,425
Anyway, who's the killer today?

1238
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:41,707
After all, did we just consume the calories for this mission?

1239
00:40:42,439 --> 00:40:43,954
- By the way... - I got something.

1240
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:47,170
- Jae Seok, I got something. - What's that?

1241
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,527
- I got something. - Only you got a message?

1242
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,849
Move to the next location for your mission.

1243
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,179
33 Seongsu-dong 2-ga, Seongdong-gu.

1244
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,188
It's near the former location.

1245
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,512
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1246
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,418
I think someone is playing with us.

1247
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,500
There's someone.

1248
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,988
We haven't solved the mystery about the calendar.

1249
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:06,121
If we go, in the room again...

1250
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,411
Here. It's here.

1251
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,686
What's this? Goodness.

1252
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:12,190
Goodness. I have no idea.

1253
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,199
Jae Seok, I guess there's something more.

1254
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,522
It seems there's something more.

1255
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,709
What's this? Look at this.

1256
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,720
Why? What is it?

1257
00:41:18,879 --> 00:41:24,031
(There are hidden clues to find out the killer in this place?)

1258
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:25,119
I think there's something here.

1259
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,479
What's this? Look at this.

1260
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,530
Why? What is it?

1261
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,289
(It's right in the center.)

1262
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,119
(There's a Pirate Roulette Game.)

1263
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,119
This is a Pirate Roulette Game.

1264
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,785
The address of the next location is attached under the Pirate's feet.

1265
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:38,659
Find the daggers and put it into the game.

1266
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,798
(Put in the daggers to find the address under the Pirate's feet.)

1267
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:41,981
- Daggers. - Daggers are...

1268
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,329
hidden here?

1269
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:45,623
I guess there are daggers here.

1270
00:41:45,899 --> 00:41:47,112
We need to find the daggers quickly.

1271
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:50,068
We need to pop it out to get the address under its feet.

1272
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,468
Where are the daggers?

1273
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,469
(They need to find daggers and put them into the game.)

1274
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,066
Find them. Find the daggers first.

1275
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:59,271
Does the mirror here mean something?

1276
00:41:59,419 --> 00:42:01,298
The address is under its feet.

1277
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:03,289
We can't take it out once we put it into the game.

1278
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,648
(They need to find as many daggers as possible as they can't reuse it.)

1279
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:06,135
We can't take it out.

1280
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:07,835
Do we need to find them?

1281
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,504
- Right. - The daggers.

1282
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:11,373
We can't take it out once we put it into the game.

1283
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,044
I guess there are only a few daggers.

1284
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,785
Do we need to find the daggers in here?

1285
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,099
This is... Goodness.

1286
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,398
(It's so hard to find the hidden daggers.)

1287
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,490
(This is...)

1288
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,079
(She finds a dagger on the cutting board.)

1289
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,579
(By the way, this is the dagger, right?)

1290
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,902
Jae Seok, look at this.

1291
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,119
- What's that? Is it a dagger? - I found a dagger.

1292
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,088
- She found a dagger. - Where?

1293
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,718
(She supposedly found a dagger.)

1294
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,148
(Hearing So Min found a dagger, the members gather.)

1295
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:39,258
- Is it right? - Is this a dagger?

1296
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,218
- I've played it before. - Does this go into the game?

1297
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:42,806
- Wait a minute. - Does this go into the game?

1298
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,059
(Can this go into the game?)

1299
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,559
(It can't go into the game.)

1300
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,068
- This is not the dagger. - This is not it.

1301
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,252
- But it has the R mark. - This is it. Here it is.

1302
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,468
This is not the dagger.

1303
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,769
(They thought it's not what they're looking for.)

1304
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:55,068
(After taking off the cover,)

1305
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:56,869
(they found the hidden dagger.)

1306
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,394
- This is it. - We found it.

1307
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,528
You know, this is...

1308
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:02,249
We're done if we put it and the pirate comes out.

1309
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,278
That's it. We're done.

1310
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:05,905
- Jae Seok. - Right. Jae Seok. It's you.

1311
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,291
Jae Seok, you're the only one.

1312
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,849
I don't think I can do it.

1313
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,537
(Speaking of him...)

1314
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:12,659
(about the Pirate Roulette Game,)

1315
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,088
(he can point out the hole for someone else.)

1316
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:19,559
(He can point out the hole for any size of the game and any player.)

1317
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,853
(He can pop the pirate out with his hand.)

1318
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,581
Jae Seok, you're the only one.

1319
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:30,098
(Can he pop it out with the first dagger?)

1320
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:33,338
(They can escape the room if the pirate comes out on the first try.)

1321
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:36,403
(Could Jae Seok's magic continue?)

1322
00:43:36,769 --> 00:43:37,981
Jae Seok, you're the only one.

1323
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,598
(Can he pop it out with the first dagger?)

1324
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,038
(They can escape the room if the pirate comes out on the first try.)

1325
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:45,138
Please, please.

1326
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:48,009
(Could Jae Seok's magic continue?)

1327
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,348
(The pirate doesn't move.)

1328
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:52,749
(He fails in taking out the pirate.)

1329
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,589
(He's just unlucky today.)

1330
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,730
It doesn't work.

1331
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,348
"Springtime in Hometown"? What is it? Let me see.

1332
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:00,308
- There's a song. - Let me see.

1333
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,288
- This is it. - "Springtime in Hometown"? What?

1334
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:04,844
(Kwang Soo finds...)

1335
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:07,859
(two pieces of scores on the desk.)

1336
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,529
The bicycle is coming

1337
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,742
Why is it here?

1338
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:12,011
Where?

1339
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:14,399
Where's the calendar? It was on the calendar too.

1340
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,531
The calendar had to red border too, didn't it?

1341
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,968
(Both the score and the calendar have a red border.)

1342
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:19,078
I guess it had.

1343
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:20,279
Why is the "Springtime in Hometown" here?

1344
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,479
What does this mean?

1345
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,904
It drives me crazy when I see this. I'm so curious.

1346
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:25,392
You're so curious, aren't you?

1347
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:26,518
Ting-a-ling

1348
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,560
What?

1349
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:28,629
Why?

1350
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,604
The score misses some musical notes.

1351
00:44:31,489 --> 00:44:32,888
(It misses some musical notes.)

1352
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:34,030
It misses some musical notes. Look.

1353
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:35,905
There are no musical notes for "Ting".

1354
00:44:36,059 --> 00:44:37,545
- What? - There are not, right?

1355
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:39,951
- Here too. - Wait a minute. What's this?

1356
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,629
- This here is... - "Ting"...

1357
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,640
It's sol.

1358
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:44,928
- No, it's here. - Is it fa?

1359
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,169
Do, re... This is sol.

1360
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,468
Mi, this is fa.

1361
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:48,939
- Fa. Fa. - Sol, sol...

1362
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:50,408
- Fa. - Fa.

1363
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:51,569
- Fa. - Fa, fa.

1364
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,408
It misses a part. Jae Seok, come here.

1365
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:55,238
- What are you saying? - Here, for "Ting-a-ling",

1366
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:56,979
there's a musical note missing.

1367
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,149
It's not here too.

1368
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,419
Sol, la, si, do, re, mi.

1369
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,732
Mi. It's mi.

1370
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,608
- What's this? - It's the high mi.

1371
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,189
- This is fa. - Jae Seok, Monday was missing.

1372
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:06,618
Isn't it Wolmido Island?

1373
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:08,912
(Monday was missing in the calendar. Isn't it Wolmido Island?)

1374
00:45:09,429 --> 00:45:11,046
- What's this? - Mi and do.

1375
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,270
Wolmido Island.

1376
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:14,658
I guess it's Wolmido Island. Wol, mi, do.

1377
00:45:14,659 --> 00:45:15,680
Is it Wolmido Island?

1378
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,393
- Monday was missing. - You're right.

1379
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:19,881
Is it Wolmido Island?

1380
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:23,483
Is it really Wolmido Island?

1381
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,169
Isn't this fa?

1382
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,339
First, let's find the address.

1383
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,479
(Let's see if it really is Wolmido Island.)

1384
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,490
It's mi.

1385
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:32,618
What's this?

1386
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:33,948
(Ji Hyo searches for daggers.)

1387
00:45:33,949 --> 00:45:37,322
(She finds stairs.)

1388
00:45:37,989 --> 00:45:39,707
It has upstairs.

1389
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:41,018
I guess it's wrong.

1390
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:43,009
(Where do the stairs take her?)

1391
00:45:43,889 --> 00:45:44,888
What's this?

1392
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,081
(She arrives on the 2nd floor.)

1393
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,645
(The daggers are hidden in places on the 2nd floor.)

1394
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:55,494
- It had 2nd floor here. - 2nd floor?

1395
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:59,879
(What's the mysterious thing on one side?)

1396
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,839
- It's large here. - What's this?

1397
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,930
(She searches for daggers right away.)

1398
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,479
(She finds something.)

1399
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,751
(It's an ice jar with a dagger in it.)

1400
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,074
- What is it? Is it a dagger? - It's a dagger.

1401
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,502
- Is it in that? - It's a dagger.

1402
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,288
(Ji Hyo gets the 1st dagger hidden on the 2nd floor.)

1403
00:46:18,289 --> 00:46:19,371
- Yes? - Wait a minute.

1404
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,598
- What's this? - It looks like a maze.

1405
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,069
- There's a dagger in it. - Where?

1406
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,281
- In there. - Where?

1407
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,069
(Wooden sticks are in the object.)

1408
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:30,169
(A dagger is in the object.)

1409
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:31,968
(It's hard to get the dagger out.)

1410
00:46:31,969 --> 00:46:33,138
It's tough.

1411
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:34,250
So Min, be careful.

1412
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:35,948
Be careful.

1413
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:37,479
How many daggers do we need to find?

1414
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,571
I guess there are big ones and small ones.

1415
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,988
I'll take this away.

1416
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:44,189
(It's tough, right?)

1417
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,988
(I already took it.)

1418
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:49,058
She found it. She did it.

1419
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:51,857
(They get an additional dagger thanks to So Min.)

1420
00:46:53,659 --> 00:46:55,129
Ji Hyo, find the dagger. Let's go downstairs.

1421
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,280
(Let's go downstairs.)

1422
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:58,529
- Find it. So Min. - Yes?

1423
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,939
- Let's go downstairs. - Let's go.

1424
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,368
(They were about to finish their search for daggers.)

1425
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:02,509
(Ji Hyo finds something.)

1426
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:03,549
Ji Hyo, you're amazing.

1427
00:47:03,969 --> 00:47:05,899
It's amazing. She found one more.

1428
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,038
You're the best.

1429
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:08,578
(The dagger was attached to the picture of Napoleon.)

1430
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,479
(Ji Hyo's sharp eyes got one more dagger.)

1431
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,822
- I found one more. - You're good.

1432
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,479
You keep finding them.

1433
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,178
- Let's go now. - I think it's enough.

1434
00:47:15,179 --> 00:47:16,649
Where are the daggers?

1435
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,018
(The guys downstairs don't make any progress.)

1436
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:20,282
Where can we find the daggers?

1437
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:22,571
Wolmido Island?

1438
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:24,044
- We need to find hints. - Right.

1439
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,388
This has R attached on it.

1440
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:26,399
(They need more daggers to check the next location.)

1441
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,069
(He finally finds a dagger.)

1442
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,786
- It's here. - There are a lot of them.

1443
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,038
(In the freezer in the kitchen,)

1444
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:36,638
(they find popsicles frozen on the dagger.)

1445
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:37,638
(It's here.)

1446
00:47:37,639 --> 00:47:39,226
It's here.

1447
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,308
- There are a lot of them. - I saw R on it.

1448
00:47:41,309 --> 00:47:42,319
It's frozen.

1449
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,971
- We can eat them. - We need to eat these.

1450
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,848
- They look delicious. - We can eat them.

1451
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:47,859
(They need to eat the popsicles to get the daggers.)

1452
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:49,388
Come here. Have some popsicles.

1453
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:51,269
- Give it to me. I'll eat it. - I can't eat this.

1454
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,400
Kwang Soo, eat some popsicles.

1455
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,928
(What's this?)

1456
00:47:57,929 --> 00:47:59,041
It's sophora root tea.

1457
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,822
- It's sophora root tea. - Is it sophora root tea?

1458
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,755
It's calamansi. Calamansi.

1459
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,556
- It's sophora root tea. - It's unbelievable.

1460
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:07,868
(He tasted it later.)

1461
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:08,910
It's a popsicle made of sophora root tea.

1462
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,968
- It tastes really sour. - It's so sour.

1463
00:48:11,969 --> 00:48:13,394
It's totally the undiluted solution.

1464
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:15,879
(It immediately improves your complexion and dilates your pupils.)

1465
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,649
- Is this the dagger? - It tastes too strong.

1466
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,892
This is the dagger.

1467
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,249
- This is not the dagger. - It's not the dagger.

1468
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,937
We need to eat this. Gosh.

1469
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,605
This tastes really terrible.

1470
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,001
I can't eat this.

1471
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,788
- Pick one after a game. - What is it? Sophora root tea?

1472
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:28,830
I can't eat this.

1473
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,240
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1474
00:48:30,889 --> 00:48:32,546
Play rock-paper-scissors, and the loser should take a bite.

1475
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,558
Jong Kook eats it well. Let Jong Kook eat it.

1476
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,368
(They respect his taste.)

1477
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,029
Sophora root tea is good for health, Jong Kook.

1478
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,080
You can eat it, Jong Kook.

1479
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,038
- The loser should eat it. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1480
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,049
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1481
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,958
Rock-paper-scissors.

1482
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:46,408
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1483
00:48:46,409 --> 00:48:47,709
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1484
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,848
(Jae Seok, Seok Jin, and So Min win.)

1485
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:51,264
- Okay. - Paper, out.

1486
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:52,479
All right.

1487
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,678
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1488
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:55,296
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1489
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,319
(Jong Kook and Ji Hyo win.)

1490
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,330
Yes.

1491
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:00,189
Ji Hyo is out.

1492
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,558
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1493
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:03,089
(The unlucky people match.)

1494
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,988
(Haha loses.)

1495
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:06,058
- Gosh, really. - Yes.

1496
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:07,058
It's too sour.

1497
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:08,658
(Haha has to eat the calamansi popsicle.)

1498
00:49:08,659 --> 00:49:10,729
- Eat just one bite. - Eat this.

1499
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:12,069
- This is too much. - Eat this and then eat that one.

1500
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,655
This is calamansi, right?

1501
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:16,408
(His mind is detoxified as well as his body.)

1502
00:49:16,409 --> 00:49:17,582
Let's play it right away.

1503
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:18,881
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1504
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:20,238
- Rock-paper-scissors. - I can't eat this.

1505
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:21,308
(Rock-paper-scissors for the second popsicle)

1506
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:22,779
(Ji Hyo and Jae Seok lose.)

1507
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,092
- Okay. - I won.

1508
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:26,848
(The unlucky person versus the lucky)

1509
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:27,879
Rock-paper-scissors.

1510
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,689
(For a match, someone is unlucky...)

1511
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,919
(forever.)

1512
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,919
Jae Seok, you...

1513
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,658
(He loses as always.)

1514
00:49:36,659 --> 00:49:37,973
Why doesn't she lose at all?

1515
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:40,799
(Why does he lose every time?)

1516
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,868
- This tastes crazy. - It really tastes awful.

1517
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:44,428
- This is really, Jae Seok... - It might knock you out.

1518
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:46,257
- It might knock you out. - It might really knock you out.

1519
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,850
Well done.

1520
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:52,008
(Starting the ecstatic state from the sophora tea.)

1521
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:54,979
(Fatally bitter taste hits him later.)

1522
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,979
This is no joke.

1523
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,779
- This is no joke. - It will knock you out.

1524
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,218
(He's shuddering because of the bitterness.)

1525
00:49:59,219 --> 00:50:00,865
- This... - What is this?

1526
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,348
- It'll knock you out. - I can't do this.

1527
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:06,491
- This is no joke. - It's good for you.

1528
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:08,288
This is no joke.

1529
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:10,328
- It's so bitter. - Look at this.

1530
00:50:10,329 --> 00:50:13,428
(After eating the bitter popsicles, they obtain 2 daggers.)

1531
00:50:13,429 --> 00:50:15,348
Hey, hey.

1532
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,915
I think the sophora tea is the worst.

1533
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:20,166
- It can't be that bad. - Try it yourself.

1534
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,752
Please come up.

1535
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,069
(Kwang Soo has a high chance of getting the penalty.)

1536
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:25,080
Go on.

1537
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:27,808
(Will he succeed in making the pirate come up?)

1538
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:29,279
(Fails)

1539
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,709
- This is driving me mad. - You should do it instead.

1540
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,209
(He fails to make the pirate appear.)

1541
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,618
You should do it instead, Jae Seok.

1542
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:36,018
It won't work for people who are unlucky.

1543
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:37,118
(The true unluck one reappears.)

1544
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,848
(He aims to regain his reputation.)

1545
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,323
(Fails)

1546
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,488
(Why am I not unlucky today?)

1547
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:44,773
Do we have to look for them again?

1548
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:46,847
Do we have to eat another popsicle?

1549
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:49,049
- Should we try going up? - We poked in so many daggers.

1550
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,142
I feel like there are more upstairs.

1551
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,598
(The miners are moving to the gold mine on the 2nd floor.)

1552
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,519
This is no joke. It was undiluted.

1553
00:50:56,539 --> 00:50:58,368
(Where could it be?)

1554
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:00,979
(I haven't seen this box before. What could it be?)

1555
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,609
(He takes it out.)

1556
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,609
What is this?

1557
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:05,943
(Searching)

1558
00:51:07,219 --> 00:51:09,411
- What on earth is this? - What is it?

1559
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:10,718
What on earth is this?

1560
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,518
(There is something inside the box.)

1561
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:14,408
- It's quite wet. - What is it?

1562
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:17,158
Put your hand in it again.

1563
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,759
(Kwang Soo puts in his hand again.)

1564
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,899
(What was that? He's focused.)

1565
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,098
There it is. There's a dagger.

1566
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:24,109
- Come on. - My gosh.

1567
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:25,868
(There's something else other than the dagger.)

1568
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,868
- Take it out. - There it is. There's a dagger.

1569
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:31,209
(The mysterious creature grabs his hand and doesn't let go.)

1570
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,979
(What's happening to Kwang Soo?)

1571
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,090
Why?

1572
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,578
- What? - What's wrong?

1573
00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:36,709
(What's happening to Kwang Soo?)

1574
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:38,348
- What's wrong? - Why?

1575
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:39,819
(What's the wet and mysterious creature inside the box?)

1576
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,142
- What's in it? - Goodness.

1577
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,246
- An abalone. - It's an abalone.

1578
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:48,939
(Screaming)

1579
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,689
(They obtain a dagger together with an abalone.)

1580
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,928
- It's an abalone. - An abalone.

1581
00:51:52,929 --> 00:51:54,299
How's an abalone this big?

1582
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,229
(The mysterious creature was...)

1583
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,999
(an abalone with a dagger.)

1584
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,586
It was inside an abalone.

1585
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:03,109
Was it in there?

1586
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,808
- It was with an abalone. - What?

1587
00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:05,850
There's one more here.

1588
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:07,538
- What? - There's one more here.

1589
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:09,094
- Here. - Put your hand in it.

1590
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,853
(What's inside this box?)

1591
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:14,894
Should I...

1592
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:16,965
- Is there one more? - Gosh.

1593
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:18,903
- Why? - There's...

1594
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:20,702
- What is it? - There is someone's hair in it.

1595
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,388
- Someone's hair. - Just put it in.

1596
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:25,029
- It's really someone's hair. - Stop lying.

1597
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,629
- It's someone's hair. - This is nothing.

1598
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:29,399
You should be able to do this.

1599
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,968
(What's in the box?)

1600
00:52:31,969 --> 00:52:32,979
(Goodness)

1601
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,968
You can do it. You're amazing.

1602
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:37,868
(I feel uneasy with him as well.)

1603
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:38,879
You're looking great.

1604
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,450
You can feel it, right?

1605
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,308
- My goodness. - What is it?

1606
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:44,249
(What's the thing that Seok Jin was making a fuss about?)

1607
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,492
- What was that? - Goodness.

1608
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,249
- Take a look inside. - There's nothing.

1609
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,037
- I wish we could find one more. - There's nothing.

1610
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,118
- Try going in further. - There it is.

1611
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,649
I found it.

1612
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:54,983
Great. We're doing well.

1613
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,843
Let's go downstairs since we found them.

1614
00:52:56,889 --> 00:52:59,152
- Let's go down. - Gosh.

1615
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,299
- Did you find it? - You better make it work this time.

1616
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,098
- If it doesn't work this time... - Seriously.

1617
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:04,968
(Will they be able to succeed this time?)

1618
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:06,399
I feel like there's one here.

1619
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,538
(It popped up.)

1620
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,339
(The pirate is out.)

1621
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,339
- Gosh. - It worked.

1622
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,339
(His bad luck is back.)

1623
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,538
- It came out. - It did.

1624
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:14,994
- It came out. - It's out.

1625
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:16,796
- It's out. - Seoul...

1626
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,848
(But something isn't right.)

1627
00:53:19,849 --> 00:53:22,348
- It's out. - It's the same address from before.

1628
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:23,388
(It's the same place from before.)

1629
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:24,488
(The address that was written on the pirate is...)

1630
00:53:24,489 --> 00:53:25,731
- Where our first mission was. - Yes.

1631
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,041
It's the first place we were at. The crime scene.

1632
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:33,676
(the location where the assistant director was killed.)

1633
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,098
- Do we have to go there again? - Where the assistant director was.

1634
00:53:36,099 --> 00:53:37,098
Is it that place?

1635
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:39,019
- There's something more there. - Then let's go.

1636
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,538
I think we need to head there first to be sure about things.

1637
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:42,598
- Okay. - Let's go.

1638
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,659
(What kind of secrets are hidden in that place?)

1639
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,308
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1640
00:53:47,309 --> 00:53:48,824
(They head to the address that they obtained with complications.)

1641
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,448
- Do we not have a car? - Why are there two cars?

1642
00:53:52,449 --> 00:53:53,848
(Why are there two cars?)

1643
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:56,018
- Why are there two cars? - We should split.

1644
00:53:56,019 --> 00:53:57,718
This one says "Jee Seok Jin, four people".

1645
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:00,082
(Why are there two cars?)

1646
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,532
What does "Jee Seok Jin, four people" mean?

1647
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,189
(The other car...)

1648
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,759
- What? - "Song Ji Hyo, four people".

1649
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,529
(The other car says "Song Ji Hyo, 4 people".)

1650
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,029
This is strange.

1651
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,698
- It's one of these two. - No.

1652
00:54:12,699 --> 00:54:14,658
(Song Ji Hyo and Jee Seok jin. One of them is the culprit.)

1653
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,069
(This is too strange to be true.)

1654
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,339
- Oh, my gosh. - Goodness.

1655
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,808
- No, I'm not. - It can't be.

1656
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,908
But we did suspect these two all day long.

1657
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:25,549
(Why are their names written on the car?)

1658
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:26,919
Are you hiding something?

1659
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,988
I have nothing to hide. It's not me.

1660
00:54:29,989 --> 00:54:32,649
There is a reason behind why it was in her shoes.

1661
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:34,235
I don't know anything.

1662
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,259
I don't know anything.

1663
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,928
These two were related to this.

1664
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:40,428
I'm not related to this.

1665
00:54:40,429 --> 00:54:42,217
- Then why would... - I don't know anything.

1666
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,313
Which car do we get on?

1667
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,839
We have to separate ourselves strategically.

1668
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,820
Why is my name written here?

1669
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,450
It's making me feel uneasy.

1670
00:54:50,539 --> 00:54:52,428
This is driving me mad.

1671
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,078
What do we do? Do we have to get separated?

1672
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:56,867
- Get on. - I'm going with Ji Hyo then.

1673
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,709
This will decide our fate.

1674
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:00,770
- It will. - You're right.

1675
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,618
- I don't know anything. - Why is it Seok Jin and Ji Hyo?

1676
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:06,387
I don't know anything. I'm being used.

1677
00:55:06,659 --> 00:55:09,820
- It's not you, right? - No, I'm not. I'm being serious.

1678
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:12,058
- How about your shoes? - Really.

1679
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,524
I put on my shoes without thinking.

1680
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,729
I'm not lying. It's not me.

1681
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:19,939
I wouldn't be saying this if it was me.

1682
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,839
But what's the difference between this and that car?

1683
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,638
But we're heading to the same address.

1684
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:26,578
- The place we're heading. - We're heading to the same place.

1685
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,308
Are we divided into two teams now?

1686
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:30,408
- Why are we divided into two teams? - Exactly.

1687
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:33,106
What? Jee Seok Jin's room?

1688
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,592
- What? - Are there different rooms?

1689
00:55:34,849 --> 00:55:36,091
- There are different rooms. - What?

1690
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:37,903
It's an escape room.

1691
00:55:38,019 --> 00:55:40,018
What is Jee Seok Jin's room?

1692
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:41,707
I don't know what this is.

1693
00:55:41,889 --> 00:55:43,343
What is Jee Seok Jin's room?

1694
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:46,698
- We have to escape it again. - What is going on?

1695
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:48,013
Even the rooms are separated?

1696
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:49,740
- Separate rooms? - Gosh.

1697
00:55:51,469 --> 00:55:52,968
(What does the suspicious Jee Seok Jin's room look like?)

1698
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:55,468
- It's a crime scene. - It's a crime scene again.

1699
00:55:55,469 --> 00:55:57,086
- Goodness. - What is this place?

1700
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:59,738
What is this?

1701
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,609
(It's like a real crime scene...)

1702
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:02,994
What is this place?

1703
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:08,178
(with strange scribbles and mysterious objects.)

1704
00:56:08,179 --> 00:56:09,493
What is this?

1705
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,721
What is this? What are we supposed to do here?

1706
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:16,403
There is a lever here too.

1707
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:17,701
What happens if we pull it?

1708
00:56:17,829 --> 00:56:20,325
- Look, a safe. - There's a safe.

1709
00:56:20,429 --> 00:56:22,783
- We need to get its password. - That's right.

1710
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:25,268
- As soon as we... - We need to get its password.

1711
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:26,468
Yes, we do.

1712
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:28,318
I guess they put something in it.

1713
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:30,730
Is this a team competition?

1714
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,138
I guess so.

1715
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,908
(Team Seok Jin came back here to find the culprit.)

1716
00:56:33,909 --> 00:56:35,238
Is the door locked?

1717
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:36,448
(And they are...)

1718
00:56:36,449 --> 00:56:38,149
The door is locked again.

1719
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:39,379
(locked in again.)

1720
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,578
We need to open it before them.

1721
00:56:40,579 --> 00:56:42,018
(What will their fate be?)

1722
00:56:42,019 --> 00:56:43,606
There is Song Ji Hyo's room?

1723
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:44,932
Where? Gosh.

1724
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:47,103
- What's this? - I don't know.

1725
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,254
There is Song Ji Hyo's room.

1726
00:56:50,289 --> 00:56:51,501
There is Song Ji Hyo's room.

1727
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:53,109
Hey.

1728
00:56:55,099 --> 00:56:56,098
(It's filled with mysterious objects like the other room.)

1729
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:57,312
What is this skull sign?

1730
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,340
Why is there a mess?

1731
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:01,355
- Hey. - What?

1732
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:03,460
Come here quickly. Hold on.

1733
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,908
It's 4 against 4.

1734
00:57:04,909 --> 00:57:07,202
(Separated rooms that look similar.)

1735
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:10,377
- This is how we escape. - This is a team competition.

1736
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:12,968
Let's do this steadily.

1737
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:15,291
Gosh.

1738
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:16,399
- What? - Hey.

1739
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,649
- They're all locked. - Look around first.

1740
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:21,288
Let's find all the clues. Open up everything.

1741
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:23,552
(What will they have to do to escape the rooms?)

1742
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:25,859
We need to find some clues first.

1743
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,081
(Team Seok Jin starts searching the room.)

1744
00:57:29,429 --> 00:57:31,753
(Is there a clue in this?)

1745
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:37,009
(There must be a clue somewhere.)

1746
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,738
There is a door.

1747
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:41,891
(There must be a clue in here.)

1748
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,968
- Why? - What is this necktie?

1749
00:57:44,349 --> 00:57:45,359
What?

1750
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:47,729
What is this necktie?

1751
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,936
- What's in there? - There are more clues.

1752
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,218
Are there more clues?

1753
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,805
(There are more clues in here.)

1754
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,319
Let's listen to this.

1755
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,682
(They discover a cassette player.)

1756
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,759
(When they first arrived in the morning...)

1757
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,233
(the assistant director was holding this cassette player.)

1758
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:06,468
(A crucial hint was recorded.)

1759
00:58:06,469 --> 00:58:07,479
Let's listen to this.

1760
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,394
If you have reached this far,

1761
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:12,185
you have almost succeeded.

1762
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,399
I left clues up until here...

1763
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:17,628
and tried to chase the culprit,

1764
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,693
but I was eliminated at last.

1765
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:21,935
- It's this place. - If you find the culprit...

1766
00:58:22,179 --> 00:58:23,734
in this room and enter his name,

1767
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,213
you'll find the way to survive.

1768
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,972
- Find the culprit... - But...

1769
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,680
if you find who the culprit is later than the other team,

1770
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,689
you'll be eliminated straightaway.

1771
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,729
(You'll be eliminated straightaway.)

1772
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:35,899
Be careful.

1773
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,428
- It's a competition. - Hurry.

1774
00:58:37,429 --> 00:58:39,368
- My gosh. - It's a competition.

1775
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:42,126
- They don't know it yet. - Right. They don't know.

1776
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,520
What do they want us to enter?

1777
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:45,808
- The culprit... - What do they want us to enter?

1778
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:48,940
- Do they want us to enter it here? - How do we do that?

1779
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,779
(They don't know what and how to enter.)

1780
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:53,419
How do we do this? Why is there a necktie?

1781
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,491
(They don't know what and how to enter.)

1782
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,018
This is crazy.

1783
00:58:56,019 --> 00:58:58,343
- Hurry. Open it. - Open it.

1784
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:00,218
I don't think the other team knows that they have to hurry.

1785
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:02,319
(A battle of who's going to be eliminated.)

1786
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,581
Let's look around and find clues.

1787
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,259
Open up everything.

1788
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,359
(Team Ji Hyo doesn't know anything yet.)

1789
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,229
This is driving me mad.

1790
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,899
(They search everywhere for clues.)

1791
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,669
I don't know what's going on.

1792
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,941
(How do the clues look like?)

1793
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,908
Look, there it is.

1794
00:59:19,909 --> 00:59:21,424
(I found something.)

1795
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,178
What is it?

1796
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:24,348
(They discover the cassette player.)

1797
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:25,724
- Let's listen to it. - What is it?

1798
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,348
If you find the culprit in this room and enter his name,

1799
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:32,541
you'll find the way to survive.

1800
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,644
But if you find who the culprit is later than the other team,

1801
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:38,619
you'll be eliminated straightaway. Be careful.

1802
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:40,517
- We have to hurry. - We need to hurry.

1803
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,899
We need to find clues quickly.

1804
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,638
(They need to find who the culprit is faster to not get eliminated.)

1805
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:48,114
Where is it?

1806
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,368
- Se Chan! - What?

1807
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:52,379
(So Min found something.)

1808
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:54,294
- Se Chan! - What?

1809
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,839
What do you think this is?

1810
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,709
(She found a picture frame with red edges.)

1811
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:01,379
- What is it? - That's my childhood photo.

1812
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,269
- Isn't that Ji Hyo? - This is Ji Hyo, and there's me.

1813
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,288
That's me when I was little.

1814
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:06,319
Who's this?

1815
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,819
- Jong Kook. - There's Seok Jin.

1816
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,830
- And Jae Seok. - Jae Seok.

1817
01:00:08,989 --> 01:00:10,058
And Kwang Soo.

1818
01:00:10,059 --> 01:00:12,555
- Ji Hyo, you had short hair? - Jae Seok looks like an alien.

1819
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:14,745
There are eight photos in it.

1820
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,928
That's me when I was in elementary school.

1821
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:18,198
- 8 of us? - There's 8 of them?

1822
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:19,328
Let's just look around.

1823
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:20,551
We need to find more clues.

1824
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:23,361
That has red edges around it too.

1825
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:25,482
This is another clue.

1826
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:27,578
It says "middle". It's a Chinese character for middle.

1827
01:00:27,579 --> 01:00:29,226
- I think those two are related. - Middle.

1828
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,279
- Middle? - Come here, let's see.

1829
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,602
Let's round them up and see. What do they mean?

1830
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,979
Help me with this.

1831
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,518
(Let's combine all the clues.)

1832
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:38,772
Middle, Ji Hyo.

1833
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,604
3 octopus legs?

1834
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:42,069
Third grade in middle school.

1835
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:44,170
Third grade in middle school?

1836
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,428
(She combined all of them and it's hard to figure it out.)

1837
01:00:48,429 --> 01:00:49,814
I just got blanked out.

1838
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,780
This is a disaster.

1839
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:54,279
Hurry up, now.

1840
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:55,868
We need to hurry!

1841
01:00:55,869 --> 01:00:57,082
(Team Seok Jin only found a cassette player.)

1842
01:00:57,739 --> 01:00:59,689
We need to find more clues.

1843
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,361
- Why? What is it? - It's a CD.

1844
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:07,618
(They found a CD with red tapes.)

1845
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:08,994
- Why? What is it? - It's a CD.

1846
01:01:09,219 --> 01:01:11,573
- We need a CD player. - There it is.

1847
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:13,160
Let's play it.

1848
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,372
Let's play the CD.

1849
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:18,922
- It's already plugged in. - It is. It is plugged in.

1850
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:21,939
It's playing.

1851
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,040
It's the "Magic Castle".

1852
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,143
- "Magic Castle"? - It's "Magic Castle".

1853
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:28,669
(The CD had the Classic's song, "Magic Castle"!)

1854
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:31,063
Is there something missing? Like a letter in the song, maybe?

1855
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,839
- "Magic Castle". - "Magic Castle"?

1856
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,638
Maybe something is missing in the song.

1857
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,356
(They're singing along in the hope of figuring it out.)

1858
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,348
(The world that will spread out before us)

1859
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:48,158
(Is too precious when we're together)

1860
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,388
- It's not missing a letter. - All the lyrics are in there.

1861
01:01:49,389 --> 01:01:50,439
All the lyrics are in there.

1862
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:52,473
Why did we even listen to it?

1863
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:54,439
The "Magic Castle"?

1864
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:57,251
- What's with "Magic Castle"? - What could it mean?

1865
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,899
What does it mean?

1866
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,138
What could it mean?

1867
01:02:00,139 --> 01:02:01,381
He's up in the air, so what?

1868
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,893
Freely

1869
01:02:05,469 --> 01:02:06,578
We need more clues.

1870
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:08,138
(They need another clue to find the culprit.)

1871
01:02:08,139 --> 01:02:09,352
- Seok Jin! - What.

1872
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:10,459
I found a CD.

1873
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,279
(He found the second CD in a box.)

1874
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,492
- It's a CD! - CD.

1875
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:16,348
(They hope it's better evidence.)

1876
01:02:16,349 --> 01:02:17,518
- There's another CD. - It's another CD.

1877
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:18,560
- It's a CD. - CD.

1878
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:20,174
What is going on?

1879
01:02:20,289 --> 01:02:22,018
- It's a CD. - Play it.

1880
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:23,847
(What song will this one have?)

1881
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,069
Here we go.

1882
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:28,499
(Second clue)

1883
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,629
(Seok Jin's song, "I Know")

1884
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,640
It's my song.

1885
01:02:31,969 --> 01:02:33,282
- "I Know". - "I Know".

1886
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,891
- What is this? - Should you know something?

1887
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,251
I think there's something on him.

1888
01:02:38,409 --> 01:02:40,934
- Come here. - I think he's supposed to know it.

1889
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,209
- "Magic Castle". - It's not in here.

1890
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,808
(Nothing is on his name tag.)

1891
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:46,678
- It's your song. - It's called "I Know".

1892
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:47,979
"I Know"...

1893
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:48,990
I know?

1894
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,819
They're saying you do.

1895
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,204
- I do? - Hold on.

1896
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:53,331
What are the lyrics?

1897
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,518
I know that I love you.

1898
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:58,116
I feel your warm breath, but you're not...

1899
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:01,190
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E444 Running Man</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">"Room Escape"</font>
<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1900
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,552
with me. I forgot the lyrics.

1901
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,313
(If he's supposed to know, they're stuck in here forever.)

1902
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:07,952
You said "I Know".

1903
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,049
"I Know"?

1904
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,955
I know? I'm supposed to know?

1905
01:03:11,269 --> 01:03:12,351
What do I know?

1906
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:15,602
- It's saying you know. - I really don't.

1907
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,964
- I know? - It's a password.

1908
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,118
It's saying you do.

1909
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:22,139
(Seok Jin carefully approaches the safe.)

1910
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,348
(He starts entering numbers.)

1911
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:27,259
(Opening)

1912
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,087
(The safe is open!)

1913
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,946
- What's he doing? - Oh, I opened it!

1914
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:33,640
How did you open it?

1915
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,939
How did you open it?

1916
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,029
Did you know?

1917
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:39,252
- I just put in my date of birth. - I told you.

1918
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,591
- My date of birth. - I told you you knew.

1919
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:42,968
This is...

1920
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:45,565
(What's in the safe?)

1921
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,738
(There's a laptop.)

1922
01:03:48,739 --> 01:03:50,265
I told you you knew.

1923
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:52,024
Well, I didn't.

1924
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:53,518
- I told you. - You knew.

1925
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:55,948
(Team Seok Jin gets the laptop thanks to Seok Jin.)

1926
01:03:55,949 --> 01:03:58,049
- Come on. - Hurry up.

1927
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,060
I can't believe this.

1928
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,459
How could I have known?

1929
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,732
(What's in this laptop?)

1930
01:04:03,889 --> 01:04:05,788
(The laptop is...)

1931
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:08,527
(locked!)

1932
01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:09,729
We need a password.

1933
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,098
(They need the password to log in.)

1934
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:13,109
Now what?

1935
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,939
- Could it be my... - Your date of birth?

1936
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,233
(Is the password his date of birth?)

1937
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:20,678
(He enters his date of birth again.)

1938
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:22,038
- That's not it. - It doesn't work.

1939
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:23,322
(It was the wrong password.)

1940
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,599
We found this, but it isn't over.

1941
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:28,464
This is unbelievable.

1942
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,948
(Team Seok Jin is still wrapped in mystery.)

1943
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:32,445
- We need to figure this out too. - What's the password?

1944
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,376
What could it be?

1945
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,604
What do they mean?

1946
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,070
Where's that picture?

1947
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,340
Here it is!

1948
01:04:39,659 --> 01:04:40,973
Here's the picture.

1949
01:04:41,030 --> 01:04:42,313
Ji Hyo, is this when you were in middle school?

1950
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:43,611
Yes, middle school.

1951
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:46,149
Middle. Middle school.

1952
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,537
(Ji Hyo found something.)

1953
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,578
(She found the third clue!)

1954
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:56,922
- What is it? - There another one.

1955
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:00,249
It's Ji Hyo's picture! That's you, isn't it?

1956
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,578
It is me, but...

1957
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:02,994
- What is going on with you? - When was this picture taken?

1958
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,589
Look at her middle finger.

1959
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,689
(Her middle finger is highlighted.)

1960
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:07,700
Ji Hyo.

1961
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,259
(Why is the middle finger highlighted?)

1962
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,451
Monday, Mi, middle,

1963
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:14,098
and Ji Hyo.

1964
01:05:14,099 --> 01:05:16,029
(The clues are Monday, Mi, middle, and Ji Hyo.)

1965
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,399
We need to open this safe.

1966
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:19,995
Should we combine some numbers we found?

1967
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:21,885
We don't know how many we need.

1968
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,408
- How many... - We need 6 digits.

1969
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:25,768
(The safe opens with a 6-digit password.)

1970
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:27,425
Wait, let me get my head straight.

1971
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:30,038
Where did we find the key?

1972
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:32,200
(Let's see, 6 digits...)

1973
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:36,549
Ji Hyo, I need the first six digits of your social security numbers.

1974
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,176
(Ji Hyo, what's your date of birth?)

1975
01:05:40,289 --> 01:05:41,488
The first 6 digits.

1976
01:05:41,489 --> 01:05:42,819
(Is it her date of birth just like in Seok Jin's room?)

1977
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:43,928
- 81... - You put them in.

1978
01:05:43,929 --> 01:05:46,384
(Is it her date of birth just like in Seok Jin's room?)

1979
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:50,698
(Opening)

1980
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:52,268
(The safe is open.)

1981
01:05:52,269 --> 01:05:54,117
- It's open. - What is it?

1982
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:56,669
- It's open. - What is it?

1983
01:05:56,670 --> 01:05:58,339
(Team Ji Hyo gets the laptop thanks to So Min.)

1984
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,408
- It's open. - It was my date of birth.

1985
01:05:59,409 --> 01:06:00,450
What was the password?

1986
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:02,209
- My date of birth. - It was your date of birth?

1987
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,471
She put in her date of birth, and it opened.

1988
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:06,025
- How'd they know my ID numbers? - Hold on, let's see.

1989
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:08,876
All the clues we found, let's round them up.

1990
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:09,990
The first one was...

1991
01:06:11,219 --> 01:06:12,664
- Monday was missing. - Right.

1992
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:14,704
And then the long-legged octopus.

1993
01:06:15,090 --> 01:06:17,328
- So 4 Mondays were missing. - Yes, 4.

1994
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:19,552
- 3 long-legged octopuses. - So, 3.

1995
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,588
- We have 4, 3, - And this one. 4, 3, 7?

1996
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:24,169
- 7 and 15? - But I don't know the order.

1997
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,241
- 4, 3, 7, and 15. - Yes, 7 and 15.

1998
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,268
It could be 43715.

1999
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:28,885
- Put them in, 43715. - That's 5 digits.

2000
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:31,160
- 43715. - 437...

2001
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:32,268
- 15. - 15.

2002
01:06:32,269 --> 01:06:33,824
- Or 43157. - Right.

2003
01:06:34,179 --> 01:06:35,926
- Now put in 43... - 157.

2004
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:38,908
- 43... - 157.

2005
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:40,630
43157?

2006
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:42,919
- Wrong password. - Do we have...

2007
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,089
Do we have more clues? This is too hard!

2008
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:46,749
(What would be the laptop's password?)

2009
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,113
- I'm totally blank. - Me too.

2010
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:52,552
- "Magic Castle". - When we freely

2011
01:06:52,659 --> 01:06:55,184
- Fly through the air - Fly through the air

2012
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,729
("Magic Castle" and "I Know"...)

2013
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:01,739
(should have something to do with the password.)

2014
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,209
Where is it?

2015
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:05,839
(Jae Seok is still trying to find clues.)

2016
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,850
"Magic Castle".

2017
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,819
- What? - What?

2018
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,908
(There was...)

2019
01:07:11,909 --> 01:07:12,948
There's one more CD?

2020
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:14,768
(another CD between chairs.)

2021
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:17,448
(Jae Seok's discovery.)

2022
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:18,448
It's the third one.

2023
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:19,732
Right, the third one.

2024
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,658
I still can't figure out the "Magic Castle".

2025
01:07:22,659 --> 01:07:25,488
(What song is in the third clue?)

2026
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:28,209
It's "Gee".

2027
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:29,910
"Gee"?

2028
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:32,598
How many are the Girls' Generation?

2029
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:33,598
Nine members.

2030
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:34,609
("Magic Castle", "I Know", and now "Gee".)

2031
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,517
Girls' Generation, "Magic Castle",

2032
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,839
- "Gee". - "Gee"?

2033
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,162
(Where's the correlation between those three?)

2034
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:41,722
"Magic Castle" and "Gee".

2035
01:07:42,409 --> 01:07:45,348
(They have three clues, but still don't have a clue.)

2036
01:07:45,349 --> 01:07:47,096
How many "Gee"s are there?

2037
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,443
- Five "Gee"s. - Gee, gee, gee, gee, gee

2038
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,018
(Gee, I wish I knew.)

2039
01:07:51,019 --> 01:07:52,029
What does "Gee" mean?

2040
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:55,488
I think "Gee" was just for Jee Seok Jin.

2041
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:57,589
(I think "Gee" was just for Jee Seok Jin.)

2042
01:07:57,590 --> 01:07:59,189
- Right? - Makes sense.

2043
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:01,350
- Oh, was it? - And the "Magic Castle" was...

2044
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,015
- What about "Magic Castle"? - to tell us his surname.

2045
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,368
- His surname! - Jee.

2046
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:05,768
- Was it? - Yes, I think so.

2047
01:08:05,769 --> 01:08:07,439
- It meant the surname? - Your surname, Jee.

2048
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,550
Maybe it is.

2049
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:11,209
(First clue)

2050
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:14,644
("Magic Castle" was about Seok Jin's surname, Jee.)

2051
01:08:15,739 --> 01:08:17,808
(Third clue)

2052
01:08:17,809 --> 01:08:21,012
("Gee" referred to Jee.)

2053
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:23,049
- So we need to combine the hints. - That's right.

2054
01:08:23,050 --> 01:08:25,018
Right? I think so. We were missing Mi in the score.

2055
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:26,838
(All the clues should lead to the password.)

2056
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,170
Monday, Mi...

2057
01:08:28,519 --> 01:08:31,189
There's got to be something.

2058
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,129
We haven't found anything related to these clues.

2059
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:36,228
- That's true. - So this is missing the Mondays?

2060
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:37,728
- Right. - Missing Mondays.

2061
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:38,739
Could it be...

2062
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,187
I don't think it's Monday,

2063
01:08:41,539 --> 01:08:42,813
I think it's the letters "Mon".

2064
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:44,568
- Right? - "Mon".

2065
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:47,978
(I think it's not Monday but the letters "Mon".)

2066
01:08:47,979 --> 01:08:49,899
- "Mon"? - I think that's the clue.

2067
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,309
- Right? - "Mon".

2068
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,719
- Since it's not in Korean. - I did think of that before.

2069
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,678
"Mon". This is so frustrating.

2070
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:58,162
"Mon".

2071
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:00,030
Wait!

2072
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,019
(Did he figure it out?)

2073
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:03,118
Wait!

2074
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:04,705
- Why? - What is it?

2075
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,373
- What is it? - What?

2076
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:08,745
Fine dust.

2077
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,087
Put it in. Enter "Fine Dust".

2078
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:13,028
- Three from the octopus? - Right, the octopus.

2079
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:14,339
(Will it be the right password?)

2080
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,723
Come on, hurry up. Hurry up.

2081
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:18,269
It's open!

2082
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:20,438
("Fine Dust" was the right password!)

2083
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,009
(Ji Hyo's room members are instantly eliminated.)

2084
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:24,222
- What's happening? - What is it?

2085
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:27,919
(They were also trying to figure out the password.)

2086
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,249
- They figured it out? - They did?

2087
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,038
- They figured it out? - Team Seok Jin...

2088
01:09:31,149 --> 01:09:33,341
has entered the name of the culprit.

2089
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:36,118
Team Ji Hyo will be eliminated as a whole.

2090
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:37,788
(Team Ji Hyo will be eliminated as a whole.)

2091
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:39,188
(Fine dust was the password and the culprit.)

2092
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:40,188
All of us?

2093
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,799
(Fine dust was the password and the culprit.)

2094
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,898
We got it!

2095
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:44,469
(Instructions on how to survive are on the screen.)

2096
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:45,611
This is it.

2097
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:48,499
"If one person finds the lever and pulls it..."

2098
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,738
(The door will open.)

2099
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,285
"Only three people can get out."

2100
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:52,938
My goodness.

2101
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,578
(Jong Kook fails to read the directions.)

2102
01:09:54,579 --> 01:09:55,691
The lever.

2103
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:57,849
"Only three people can get out."

2104
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,778
(The person who pulls the lever without thinking...)

2105
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,549
(is Jong Kook.)

2106
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,519
- Pull it. - Pull it.

2107
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,019
- Jung Kook. - Keep your hands on it.

2108
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,049
Keep your hands on it.

2109
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:07,837
- Keep your hands on it, - Let's escape.

2110
01:10:07,989 --> 01:10:10,259
- Keep your hands on it, - Keep your hands on it,

2111
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,889
- Keep your hands on it, - What?

2112
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,959
(They leave Jong Kook behind.)

2113
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,475
What?

2114
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:16,540
What?

2115
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:18,398
(The confetti bombs go off inside the room.)

2116
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:19,581
What is going on?

2117
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,882
Okay.

2118
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:22,738
- What? - What?

2119
01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:26,309
(The 3 escapees get water bombs.)

2120
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:27,724
- What? - What's going on?

2121
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:29,578
What?

2122
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:30,809
What is going on?

2123
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:31,978
(They have no idea what is going on.)

2124
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:33,408
What is going on?

2125
01:10:33,409 --> 01:10:34,448
- What is going on? - What is going on?

2126
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:35,818
- What happened? - I mean...

2127
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:37,749
- The winner is Kim Jong Kook. - Why?

2128
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,889
(For some reason, the winner is Kim Jong Kook.)

2129
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:41,559
- What? - How did this happen?

2130
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,219
- Is Jong Kook the winner? - How did this happen?

2131
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,228
Why is Jong Kook the winner?

2132
01:10:44,229 --> 01:10:45,459
Didn't he get locked up?

2133
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,216
My goodness.

2134
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,923
(How did this happen?)

2135
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,285
Thus,

2136
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:56,639
the final winner of the race is Kim Jong Kook.

2137
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,868
(The final winner of the race, Kim Jong Kook)

2138
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:00,438
I didn't do much today.

2139
01:11:00,439 --> 01:11:02,038
I think I get it.

2140
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:03,849
- The hint was fine dust. - That was the culprit.

2141
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,709
People who went outside got eliminated due to fine dust.

2142
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,519
- That's right. - They got killed off.

2143
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,618
(Did people who went outside got eliminated due to fine dust?)

2144
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:10,688
I will explain.

2145
01:11:10,689 --> 01:11:14,719
Today, you had Running Man's 444th Episode Special.

2146
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,519
- 444. - Case Number 444,

2147
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,782
Mysterious Cause of Death Race.

2148
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:22,286
- Mysterious Cause of Death Race. - The assistant director was out...

2149
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:25,964
because of the hottest issue, fine dust.

2150
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,339
I relate to the storyline.

2151
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,868
Let's go over the hints you found.

2152
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,908
The calendar was missing Monday.

2153
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:32,938
"Monday" was missing.

2154
01:11:32,939 --> 01:11:34,709
- It was like a drama. - I know.

2155
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,879
(The assistant director had a calendar.)

2156
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,978
("Monday" was missing.)

2157
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:42,019
(Mon)

2158
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,618
(Mon)

2159
01:11:44,619 --> 01:11:46,519
- We focused on Monday. - It didn't help us.

2160
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,188
Then Seok Jin suddenly went...

2161
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:50,259
- I realized it's "Mon". - "Isn't it 'Mon'?"

2162
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,108
- Then Jong Kook said, "Mon". - "Mon".

2163
01:11:52,229 --> 01:11:54,599
- Then Jae Seok said... - "Dust".

2164
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,872
("Mon" and other hints make up "Fine dust" in Korean.)

2165
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,698
We thought of it as Monday all day long.

2166
01:11:58,699 --> 01:12:00,299
In the restaurant of the second mission,

2167
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,269
you had long-legged octopus,

2168
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:03,868
which uses the same character...

2169
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:06,509
as the one in "fine dust".

2170
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:07,809
I see.

2171
01:12:07,810 --> 01:12:09,339
- "Se" in Korean. - "Se".

2172
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,578
The same character.

2173
01:12:10,579 --> 01:12:12,973
Where you found the swords of the Pirate Roulette Game...

2174
01:12:13,819 --> 01:12:14,879
Mi. It's mi.

2175
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,148
(They found music sheets without mi.)

2176
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:18,219
"Mi" is missing.

2177
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:21,017
- The missing note was... - "Mi".

2178
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,564
The last hint was the last name of Seok Jin, Jee...

2179
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:26,629
or the middle letter of Ji Hyo's name, Ji.

2180
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,499
(There was a hint that was related to Ji Hyo.)

2181
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,898
(This is another clue.)

2182
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:31,169
(Look at the red frame.)

2183
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,775
(Only Ji Hyo's picture was from her middle school days.)

2184
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,769
I laughed so much at these pictures.

2185
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:41,709
Jong Kook is handsome.

2186
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:42,709
Seriously.

2187
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,265
Haha looks exactly like his mother.

2188
01:12:44,949 --> 01:12:46,899
Kwang Soo resembles Yoon Sang, his cameraman.

2189
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,919
- That's right. - Yes.

2190
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,749
Only Se Chan and I...

2191
01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:53,740
are opening our mouths.

2192
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,759
- You have protruding teeth. - People with protruding teeth...

2193
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,028
can't close their mouths.

2194
01:12:58,029 --> 01:12:59,389
Kim Young Chul is the same.

2195
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,858
- I need to close my mouth. - Seriously.

2196
01:13:00,859 --> 01:13:02,879
(The culprit was...)

2197
01:13:04,270 --> 01:13:06,047
(fine dust.)

2198
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,538
(The meaning of the hidden hints)

2199
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,155
The password at the first location, 301500 represents...

2200
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:18,592
air quality index from 301 to 500, which is the most dangerous.

2201
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,078
(Duck meat was with long-legged octopus)

2202
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:23,679
Duck meat is food that is good for discharging fine dust...

2203
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:25,033
in your body.

2204
01:13:26,189 --> 01:13:28,786
The place where you found the swords...

2205
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:31,228
was filled with plants...

2206
01:13:31,229 --> 01:13:33,754
that purifies the air.

2207
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:37,698
Thus, the final winner of the race is...

2208
01:13:37,699 --> 01:13:39,129
Kim Jong Kook.

2209
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,839
You know,

2210
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,198
the process was good, but the finale...

2211
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:46,009
The finale was tainted with betrayal.

2212
01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:47,778
- It wasn't betrayal. - It wasn't betrayal.

2213
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:49,009
Don't call it a betrayal.

2214
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:50,108
We simply acted fast.

2215
01:13:50,109 --> 01:13:51,726
We were wise.

2216
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,396
- We were wise. - Listen.

2217
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,549
I had a sly thought,

2218
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:57,589
but Kwang Soo was the absolute worst.

2219
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:59,148
That's not true. That's not true.

2220
01:13:59,149 --> 01:14:00,889
- Jong Kook went to the lever. - I pulled it.

2221
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:02,688
Since nothing changed,

2222
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:04,158
I was like, "What is going on?"

2223
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,528
Kwang Soo jumped forward.

2224
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,418
"Keep your hands on the lever."

2225
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,459
- He said that. - That's right.

2226
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,028
Who are you to call him sly?

2227
01:14:11,029 --> 01:14:13,099
As a prize, Jong Kook will receive...

2228
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,169
- What will he receive? - Is there a prize?

2229
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:16,669
The assistant director who has resurrected...

2230
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,108
- My goodness. - He came back to life.

2231
01:14:18,109 --> 01:14:19,584
- Is it really a prize? - My goodness.

2232
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:20,839
Is it really a prize?

2233
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,309
I hope it will make you healthier.

2234
01:14:22,310 --> 01:14:23,578
All right.

2235
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:24,709
(Be healthier.)

2236
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,778
An air purifier.

2237
01:14:25,779 --> 01:14:28,919
- I am jealous. - Jong Kook gets everything!

2238
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,448
We always get water bombs!

2239
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:31,988
We always suffer.

2240
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:33,589
You could get married.

2241
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:35,318
(Do a better job.)

2242
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:38,589
These days, we feel down...

2243
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:40,228
- because of fine dust. - That's right.

2244
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:42,658
- It's bad for our health. - Yes.

2245
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:44,328
That's right. I miss the blue sky.

2246
01:14:44,329 --> 01:14:46,528
We hope the blue sky...

2247
01:14:46,529 --> 01:14:48,738
and clear air come back soon.

2248
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,809
- Seriously. - We will be back next week.

2249
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:52,368
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2250
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:55,813
(We hope to see the blue sky from now on.)

2251
01:14:56,180 --> 01:14:58,907
(The 11 single members assemble.)

2252
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,818
(Today, the members of Running Man will be...)

2253
01:15:00,819 --> 01:15:03,001
(the dazzling singles.)
