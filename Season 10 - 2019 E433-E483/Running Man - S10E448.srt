1
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,104
(In April, spring is in the air.)

2
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,574
- Hello. - Hi.

3
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:09,934
- Hi. - Hello.

4
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:11,004
- Hello. - Hello.

5
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:12,873
- We started. - You...

6
00:00:12,874 --> 00:00:15,113
- My gosh, seriously. - I should talk about this today.

7
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:16,513
- This is... - Jae Seok, don't even bring it up.

8
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:19,543
- Jong Kook is the angriest one. - He won't do it today.

9
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:21,453
- He has to know his limit. - The thing is that...

10
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,554
he can't cross the line. Otherwise, we can't talk about this.

11
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,793
- Come on, know your limit. - But he has gone too far this time.

12
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:30,293
When I was wearing the leggings and the pants, I felt weird.

13
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:31,363
- Right. - I see.

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:32,493
Is it the pants?

15
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:34,889
What if your boyfriend wore that outfit?

16
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:37,033
Let's hang out at home today.

17
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,963
(Going out has been banned.)

18
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:42,003
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

19
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,145
You don't want others to admire it.

20
00:00:43,405 --> 00:00:47,143
Ji Hyo, if your boyfriend wore that, what would you tell him?

21
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:48,143
Please be honest.

22
00:00:48,144 --> 00:00:50,973
I can't put up with the other stuff, except for those long johns.

23
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:53,084
But that must be really warm.

24
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:54,914
If the long johns were black...

25
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:56,084
(Taking off)

26
00:00:56,085 --> 00:00:57,437
What are you doing?

27
00:00:57,655 --> 00:00:59,923
(The anger catalyst takes off his clothes on his own.)

28
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,753
What are you doing? What? What is it?

29
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,393
- What's wrong? - No, it looks better without them.

30
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:05,123
- I mean... - It looks better without them.

31
00:01:05,124 --> 00:01:06,236
What was that?

32
00:01:07,594 --> 00:01:09,593
- Yes, yes. It's much better. - That looks much better.

33
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:11,963
- That's much better. - The pants were the problem.

34
00:01:11,964 --> 00:01:13,674
It was the pants. The pants were the problem.

35
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:15,118
- I mean... - It looks nice.

36
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,831
- Don't do it. - His outfit looks much better.

37
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:19,103
- Stop it. - Haha.

38
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,944
- You can't do that, Haha. - Don't do it.

39
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,573
- The pants are gone. - He just took them off.

40
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:24,213
Hey, they are taking videos now.

41
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:26,383
- This is a video. - Haha.

42
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:27,653
(If they tease him more, he might be completely naked.)

43
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,209
- Don't do it. - My goodness.

44
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,084
Today, on the day this episode airs,

45
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:36,924
from 5pm to midnight,

46
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:41,463
the most searched team online will be the winning team.

47
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,194
(The most searched team online wins the race.)

48
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:44,504
(Running Man)

49
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,948
- Us? - Us?

50
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,034
- What should we do to go viral? - Well,

51
00:01:48,035 --> 00:01:50,974
- Usually, guests go viral online. - That's right.

52
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:53,403
- "King of Mask Singer" goes viral. - That's right.

53
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,243
- There are other shows too. - That's right.

54
00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:57,584
If we try to go viral by ourselves,

55
00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:59,543
- it would be hard. - Right, it won't be easy.

56
00:01:59,544 --> 00:02:00,584
It's hard.

57
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:04,284
We have invited popular guests who will try to be the most...

58
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:05,496
searched team online with you.

59
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,894
Four teams are waiting for you.

60
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,854
- This will work. We'll form teams. - They have to join us.

61
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:11,394
- That's right. - It might be possible then.

62
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:15,134
2 members of Running Man and 1 guest member...

63
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,781
will form a team and proceed with matches.

64
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,304
The search word that each team must make to go viral is...

65
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,759
"Running Man and the name of the guest".

66
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:25,204
It has to be "Running Man" and the name of the guest must follow.

67
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,313
- It must be the name of the guest. - Running Man and so and so?

68
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,813
- We help the guest to go viral. - That's right.

69
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:30,913
Right.

70
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,469
- Our partner will matter a lot. - That won't be easy.

71
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,594
All right. We'll bring in the first guest. Come on out!

72
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,851
(Who is the first guest that's about to be revealed?)

73
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:43,394
- My gosh. - Hello.

74
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,505
(The icon of irreplaceable singers who climb up the charts)

75
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:47,288
- It's Hani and Solji. - It's been so long.

76
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,693
Hello.

77
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:52,604
(The legendary girl group with songs that climb up the charts)

78
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,104
(On stage, she's irresistible.)

79
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,973
(In real life, she's down-to-earth and approachable.)

80
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,621
(Yawning)

81
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:02,751
(Hani showed all sorts of her charms 4 years ago.)

82
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:07,056
(She's ready to show off her irresistible charms today.)

83
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,954
- They're finally here. - It's Solji.

84
00:03:09,955 --> 00:03:11,024
My gosh.

85
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:14,294
- It's Solji's first time here. - Right.

86
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:17,800
- We've seen Hani a lot before. - You're all better now.

87
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,463
But isn't this your first time joining us, Solji?

88
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:21,818
Yes, this is my first time being on Running Man.

89
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:25,204
I can already feel their names trending up online.

90
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,704
- You can feel that, right? - Yes, I can feel it.

91
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,134
Solji is joining us today.

92
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:29,973
- This is good. Solji will go viral. - Listen.

93
00:03:29,974 --> 00:03:33,243
- It's your first time here, Solji. - Yes.

94
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,473
After seeing your friends being on this show,

95
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:37,114
did you think that you should've been invited before?

96
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,343
And have you ever been upset that we didn't invite you before today?

97
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,839
Well, I do think that you guys invited me a bit too late.

98
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:44,223
When I thought that it was about time that you'd invite me,

99
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,084
- you still didn't invite me. - When was that?

100
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,394
When was the time that you thought you would be on our show?

101
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,794
- When I made my comeback. - I see.

102
00:03:49,795 --> 00:03:52,493
- Right. - I went viral after my comeback.

103
00:03:52,494 --> 00:03:53,563
- Right. - Yes.

104
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,963
Right. It was great. I really liked your comeback.

105
00:03:55,964 --> 00:04:00,373
When Im Won Hee was doing well on "Mom's Diary"...

106
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,132
(All of a sudden, he talks about her lookalike, Im Won Hee.)

107
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,243
- I thought it would be then. - My gosh.

108
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,604
- She resembles Im Won Hee. - Im Won Hee.

109
00:04:06,605 --> 00:04:08,313
- It was when he was doing well. - You look like him.

110
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,588
What just happened?

111
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,283
- Here we go again. - If it stays online for too long...

112
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,554
Everyone, please look up "Solji and Im Won Hee".

113
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:16,213
She can even impersonate Won Hee.

114
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,754
- Really? - Yes.

115
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,785
- I'd be worried if I do it. - Do it just this once.

116
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:25,603
(Will Solji do Won Hee's lines from "Dachimawa Lee"?)

117
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,934
A lot of people tell me that my jawline looks similar to his.

118
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,974
Yes, people say that a lot.

119
00:04:29,294 --> 00:04:31,834
"I don't think we need to introduce ourselves."

120
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,403
- What was that? What? How? - This is it.

121
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:35,903
- My gosh. - No way!

122
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:37,895
(What was that? She sounds just like him!)

123
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,303
- That was amazing. - "I don't think so."

124
00:04:40,304 --> 00:04:41,673
- Did I sound like him? - Yes, you did.

125
00:04:41,674 --> 00:04:43,274
- You sounded just like him. - I see. Thank you.

126
00:04:43,275 --> 00:04:45,164
I had no idea.

127
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:47,231
- She has a special talent. - By the way,

128
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,384
- she's great at harmonizing. - She's amazing at it.

129
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:50,923
She used to be a vocal coach too.

130
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,652
- That's right. Yes, that's true. - Really?

131
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,954
Actually, Solji used to be a vocal coach.

132
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,293
- My gosh. - What about Kwang Soo?

133
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:59,764
Kwang Soo is good at harmonizing with other singers.

134
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,194
- But... - I'm good at it.

135
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,233
- He's not good. He likes it. - I like doing it.

136
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:04,963
- He likes doing that. - Kwang Soo can probably...

137
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:07,403
- harmonize with Solji for any song. - That's right.

138
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:08,934
- Do you want to give it a go? - That would be awesome.

139
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:10,574
- Which song will you sing? - He's going to...

140
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:11,744
- harmonize for me? - Yes.

141
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,501
- He can harmonize with any songs. - Seriously. I learned how to do it.

142
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,690
- Is that so? - Really?

143
00:05:16,745 --> 00:05:18,014
- What about a sad ballad? - Really?

144
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,454
- He performs well with a ballad. - Yes.

145
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:22,283
- Like a painful love song. - How about "I Won't Love"?

146
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:23,483
- That's a great song. - That's great.

147
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:25,241
- "I Won't Love"? I'll start now. - I will never

148
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:29,653
(I will never)

149
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:32,220
(Fall in love again)

150
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:34,987
- No, no. - Someone like you

151
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,831
(Why is he putting his hand on his ear?)

152
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:40,033
(Kwang Soo, how low will you sink?)

153
00:05:40,034 --> 00:05:41,574
(We'll disappear in embarrassment just by listening to you.)

154
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,574
- What are you doing? - No.

155
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,504
- You're ruining the song. - What are you doing?

156
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:45,603
What are you doing?

157
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:46,774
(Kwang Soo's deadly melody shakes Solji.)

158
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:48,014
- This is scary. - What are you doing?

159
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,096
- He sounds scary. - I can't listen to this anymore.

160
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,972
(I will never harmonize again.)

161
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:55,454
- It was his facial expression. - But...

162
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,283
Great. Can you harmonize with Hani?

163
00:05:58,284 --> 00:06:00,084
Can Hani sing a song? And can you harmonize...

164
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:01,593
- with Hani? - Yes, harmonize with her.

165
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,593
Since both of you are singers.

166
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,824
How about "Baby Shark"?

167
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:06,363
- Can you sing that? - They can pull it off.

168
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,758
- Can you? Okay. Go ahead. - Start.

169
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,403
(Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo)

170
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,973
(Cute shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo)

171
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:15,673
(Hey, this is working!)

172
00:06:15,674 --> 00:06:18,043
(Perfect harmony)

173
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,473
- I knew it. It's the piano. - What was that?

174
00:06:19,474 --> 00:06:21,696
(But...)

175
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,843
(It looks like they are harmonizing...)

176
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,400
(But is this it?)

177
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,983
(Did you hear our harmony?)

178
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:30,328
- I knew it. It's the piano. - What was that?

179
00:06:30,784 --> 00:06:32,977
It wasn't worth making a fuss for.

180
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:34,994
- Listen. - Weren't we great?

181
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,853
- Yes, it was great. It's the piano. - Baby shark

182
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,963
I'm so proud of us.

183
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,409
- We could do this much too. - My gosh.

184
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:41,994
(If this is called harmony, we can do it too.)

185
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:45,403
(Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo)

186
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,504
(The trio sings a melody that's unexpectedly pleasant to listen to.)

187
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:50,944
(Perfect harmony)

188
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,763
(What? They're actually surprised.)

189
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:55,374
That's not how you do it.

190
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,343
(Singing)

191
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:01,353
(This is an a cappella version of the song.)

192
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,584
(As long as you can beatbox,)

193
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:05,777
(harmonizing isn't hard.)

194
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,394
(He can't believe his ears. Why does it sound pleasing?)

195
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:12,363
(The Fool, Sly Snake, and Beanpole are a threat to Hani and Solji.)

196
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:13,394
This is it.

197
00:07:13,395 --> 00:07:15,718
(This is the magic of beatboxing.)

198
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:17,033
(We'll approve your skills.)

199
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,903
- That was pretty good. - Stop it.

200
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:20,403
- My gosh. - That's enough.

201
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:21,673
- We can pull this off together. - Stop it.

202
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,874
- We're a trio. A cappella trio. - We're an a cappella group.

203
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:25,004
- This is nothing. - Right.

204
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:28,574
Actually, Hani is famous for her commercial.

205
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:31,483
- It's famous. - It goes like this.

206
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,644
- It was a very catchy song. - That's right.

207
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,684
- Everyone was singing the song. - It was a huge hit.

208
00:07:35,685 --> 00:07:36,913
- The commercial was a hit. - And the dance too.

209
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,684
I guess singing the song from the commercial might be a bit iffy.

210
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:41,024
- Why not? - If you can, can you demonstrate?

211
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:42,653
- She's so down-to-earth. - All right.

212
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:44,963
- It goes like this. - How about "Awesome Running Man"?

213
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,463
You can sing, "Awesome Running Man".

214
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:48,194
- I'm a huge fan. - I'll watch this in person.

215
00:07:48,195 --> 00:07:49,293
I'm a huge fan of this commercial.

216
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,903
- 1, 2, 3, 4. Awesome Running Man. - 3, 4.

217
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,233
(Awesome Running Man)

218
00:07:52,234 --> 00:07:53,244
Here it is.

219
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,158
(Here are the dance and the song.)

220
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,004
Yes, this is it.

221
00:07:59,005 --> 00:08:00,115
(She perfectly pulls it off.)

222
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,944
(She perfectly finishes the dance routine...)

223
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:05,113
(including the kicking dance.)

224
00:08:05,114 --> 00:08:06,113
(How cute and exciting!)

225
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,578
- Yes, this was it. My goodness. - It looked exactly the same.

226
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:11,150
I knew it. She's the best as this is her commercial.

227
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:12,723
It looked exactly the same.

228
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:15,093
Ji Hyo, can you try to do the dance routine?

229
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,723
- Do you want to do it together? - Yes, do it with So Min.

230
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:18,923
- "Awesome Running Man". - Hey, Ms. Kyeon Mi Ri.

231
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,339
- "Ms. Kyeon Mi Ri"? - In the center...

232
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,564
Do it in the center.

233
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,093
- Her pants match with mine. - It's perfect.

234
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:24,303
(It's "Awesome Running Man" with Ms. Kyeon Mi Ri.)

235
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:25,303
It's perfect.

236
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,603
(How will their performance look?)

237
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:27,774
- "Awesome". - Yes.

238
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:31,380
All right. 5, 6. 5, 6...

239
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,104
(They dance in perfect sync.)

240
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:34,125
- This is cute. - Awesome Running Man

241
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,073
(Look cute and adorable.)

242
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:41,484
(Awesome Running Man)

243
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:46,553
(It's an awesome ensemble of Ms. Kyeon, Model, and Scary Lady.)

244
00:08:46,554 --> 00:08:48,040
I can't believe I saw this in person.

245
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,224
- This was so fun. - My gosh.

246
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:51,386
- Up to two guests are allowed. - That was so fun.

247
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,815
- It was so fun. - This is nice.

248
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,134
In my opinion, they are promising front-runners today.

249
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,464
- That's right. - They might be able to win.

250
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:01,673
Hani and Solji are very strong front-runners of this race.

251
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,372
We'll bring in the next guest.

252
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,616
Come on out.

253
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,626
They're SEVENTEEN.

254
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,114
(Mingyu and Seungkwan of SEVENTEEN, a popular idol group)

255
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,761
Very nice!

256
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:15,053
(They earned the nickname Masters of Performance...)

257
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,453
(for their sharp dance moves and outstanding performances.)

258
00:09:17,454 --> 00:09:19,823
(They are excellent show hosts and excel on variety shows.)

259
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:22,094
(They are the all-around idol group that's ready for anything.)

260
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,423
(SEVENTEEN has come to Running Man...)

261
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,964
(to take over the online world.)

262
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,024
- Hello. - Very nice!

263
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,015
- Nice! - This way.

264
00:09:29,164 --> 00:09:31,734
- SEVENTEEN. - You guys are handsome.

265
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:34,274
- I really wanted to meet you guys. - First of all,

266
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:37,679
Mingyu and Seungkwan of SEVENTEEN are joining us today.

267
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,903
Let us say hello. Say the name.

268
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:41,531
- SEVENTEEN. Hello. - SEVENTEEN. Hello.

269
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:42,928
- I'm Seungkwan. - I'm Mingyu.

270
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,283
- You two have perfect teamwork. - SEVENTEEN.

271
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,698
As soon as they walked out,

272
00:09:46,914 --> 00:09:49,583
- a waft of cologne came in too. - Right, right.

273
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,978
It smells like figs. It's the scent of the figs.

274
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,754
- Isn't it from me? - Figs...

275
00:09:53,755 --> 00:09:54,793
Is your cologne fig-scented?

276
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,923
My gosh, the scent is very strong.

277
00:09:55,924 --> 00:09:58,063
- Not that many singers wear that. - No, it's not yours.

278
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,823
- My gosh. - Yes, this is it.

279
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,108
(She finds the origin of the scent.)

280
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,209
So Min, you keep pushing your hair behind your ear.

281
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:05,682
- You keep doing that. - No, no.

282
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:07,403
- Unbelievable. - There you go again.

283
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:08,974
- She started. - It's the earring.

284
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,520
It's because I'm wearing earrings today.

285
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:14,048
All right. They will be joining us today.

286
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:16,568
I think the last time Seungkwan was on our show...

287
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:19,783
- It was for 100 versus 100. - That's right. He was on our show.

288
00:10:19,784 --> 00:10:21,413
- He was the last one standing. - Yes, yes.

289
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,583
- And was that your last time here? - Was that the last time?

290
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:23,898
I was up against Lee Won Hee, the athlete.

291
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:26,953
(He competed against Lee Won Hee, the judo gold medalist,)

292
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,624
(as the last celebrity.)

293
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,624
(The 1-on-1 match to remove each other's name tag)

294
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,563
(When Won Hee spun him around hard,)

295
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:34,484
(he was frightened out of his senses.)

296
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,793
- That's right. - That's when I joined you guys.

297
00:10:36,794 --> 00:10:38,017
My gosh.

298
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,303
How long has it been?

299
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,274
It was when we had just made our debut.

300
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:42,433
It's still great news to be here,

301
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,848
but back then, everything was so fascinating.

302
00:10:44,245 --> 00:10:46,325
My agent told us that we'd be on Running Man at last.

303
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,140
We were too thankful, but there were 100 celebrities.

304
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,244
- We weren't the only guests there. - Right, right.

305
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:53,644
Back then,

306
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,583
when we had our interview,

307
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,583
you asked about our special talents. And I said that I was from Anyang.

308
00:10:57,584 --> 00:10:59,384
- I shook hands with Jong Kook. - That's right. You shook hands.

309
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,193
- That was the end of it. - Are you from Anyang?

310
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,693
- I said this about three times. - Is that so?

311
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:05,624
(I'll say this for the fourth time. I'm from Anyang.)

312
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,533
Jong Kook usually remembers if you're from Anyang.

313
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,734
- This is understandable. - Are you from Anyang?

314
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:10,264
- You're starting to forget things. - Right now...

315
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:12,134
- There will be three clips of this. - Really?

316
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,734
- Hey, you. - Stop it.

317
00:11:13,735 --> 00:11:15,188
- This happened before. - I'm sorry.

318
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:18,002
- Hold on. - I've never seen him get red.

319
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:21,073
- You don't care about Anyang now. - No, it's not that.

320
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:24,083
By any chance, did you mention this on "I Can See Your Voice"?

321
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,296
Yes, I mentioned this on that show.

322
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,407
- My gosh, I got goosebumps. - He doesn't usually get flustered.

323
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:31,254
- Has your love for Anyang weakened? - No.

324
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,583
- It's because he moved. - It's not that.

325
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:34,624
- I still love Anyang very much. - Besides...

326
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:37,423
All right. Do an acrostic poem with Anyang. It's been a while.

327
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:40,524
(If so, will Jong Kook try an acrostic poem with Anyang?)

328
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,964
- An acrostic poem with Anyang. - Anyang?

329
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:43,234
- Yes. Anyang. - Go ahead.

330
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,376
All right. "A".

331
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,364
- Anyang has... - "Y".

332
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,516
young thugs.

333
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,503
(Jong Kook's love for Anyang hasn't changed.)

334
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,943
- What was that? - What did you say?

335
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:55,114
- How... - How could you say that?

336
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,274
- What's wrong with that? - I mean...

337
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:58,384
- My goodness. - What is it?

338
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,484
How could you say that?

339
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,797
I'm sure that's not the case.

340
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,100
You must have fun when you're young.

341
00:12:03,414 --> 00:12:04,666
All right.

342
00:12:04,755 --> 00:12:06,153
His acrostic poem with Anyang was...

343
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:07,754
- neat which doesn't happen often. - That was nice.

344
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:10,048
- You finished it really nicely. - Great, great.

345
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,793
Everyone knows that Seungkwan has a lot of special talents.

346
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:13,823
- That's right. - Right.

347
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:14,833
- I'm from Jeju too. - Special talents...

348
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,309
I've never heard anyone agree with that.

349
00:12:17,095 --> 00:12:18,163
"You have a lot of talents."

350
00:12:18,164 --> 00:12:19,174
"That's right."

351
00:12:19,664 --> 00:12:20,803
- That's right. - That's impressive.

352
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:22,033
- I can't play innocent. - Seriously.

353
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,203
- Show us a few special talents. - Sure, sure.

354
00:12:23,204 --> 00:12:24,760
- Okay, okay. - Let's ask him to do a few.

355
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:27,403
- Do Lee So Ra's impersonation. - Right.

356
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,244
- She'd be sitting down... - He's really good at it.

357
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:31,214
with her legs crossed and touch her earphones.

358
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:32,744
(Getting ready)

359
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:33,744
He resembles her too.

360
00:12:33,745 --> 00:12:39,986
(I write a letter to you)

361
00:12:40,225 --> 00:12:42,094
(My gosh, he sounds just like her.)

362
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,254
- That sounded like her. - My gosh.

363
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,891
- Look at his facial expression. - Seriously.

364
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,464
(He can even copy the details of her singing.)

365
00:12:48,465 --> 00:12:53,563
(Unclear pronunciation)

366
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,463
(He finishes off with a witty twist at the end.)

367
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,091
- He's a great singer too. - He's good.

368
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,993
When he first did this, he didn't exaggerate it.

369
00:13:01,044 --> 00:13:02,863
- But after being on many shows, - Right.

370
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,005
- this has been tainted a little. - That's because...

371
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,413
- I repeated this so many times. - You...

372
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:09,303
- You exaggerated at the end. - Yes, I should continue...

373
00:13:09,385 --> 00:13:10,854
- to improve on it. I'm sorry. - Right.

374
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:11,854
Is there a new special talent?

375
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,494
- He sings Jong Shin's song too. - That's right.

376
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,869
- It's Jong Shin's song. - Don't you do that too?

377
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:18,163
- It's "Wi-Fi" by Jong Shin. - "Wi-Fi".

378
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,286
He depicted the disconnection of the Wi-Fi by singing.

379
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,394
(The song used the Wi-Fi as a metaphor...)

380
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:25,424
(to portray a break-up with a loved one.)

381
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:28,464
(How will Seungkwan's version of "Wi-Fi" sound?)

382
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:31,934
I will disconnect you

383
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:32,974
I will disconnect

384
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:35,500
(He cuts off his singing to portray the disconnection.)

385
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:39,019
As if I'm quitting smoking

386
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,854
(But the more he sings, the more it sounds...)

387
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,124
(like a folk song.)

388
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,254
(Warning: The signal is very weak.)

389
00:13:47,255 --> 00:13:48,354
(This time, he uses the Wi-Fi to be funny.)

390
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,524
- The song really sounds like this? - Yes.

391
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:51,141
Actually, you have to use the machine to make that effect.

392
00:13:51,265 --> 00:13:52,693
- The song really goes like this? - Yes, it goes like this.

393
00:13:52,694 --> 00:13:53,764
- Are you serious? - Yes.

394
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,464
- Zico wrote this. - The song goes like this.

395
00:13:55,465 --> 00:13:57,827
He's the one who helped the song climb back the charts.

396
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,045
- Maybe, we shouldn't' have. - My gosh.

397
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,120
What if this song goes viral online?

398
00:14:01,434 --> 00:14:02,803
The Wi-Fi disconnection inspired him.

399
00:14:02,804 --> 00:14:04,218
My gosh, this is so intriguing.

400
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,573
I like this song.

401
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:06,874
I should listen to the song.

402
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,413
- We must be the most searched team. - Yes, we have to do that.

403
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,758
- We must go for it. - I already mentioned that.

404
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,783
SEVENTEEN.

405
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,183
Since you're here, sing us a snippet of "Home".

406
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:15,730
- Of course. - Please sing us the song.

407
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,366
- Shall we? - Yes.

408
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,923
- My gosh. - Shall we start?

409
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,224
- Which camera should I look at? - They're so talented.

410
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,394
- They're so talented. - Right.

411
00:14:21,395 --> 00:14:22,553
Do you want to sing without the instrumental?

412
00:14:22,554 --> 00:14:24,293
- Without the music? - Without the music?

413
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:26,394
(They have to sing without the music when they're already nervous?)

414
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,063
- That might be actually better. - You should sing without the music.

415
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:29,494
- You should sing without the music. - Yes, go ahead.

416
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,252
- That will grab more attention. - That will go viral.

417
00:14:31,605 --> 00:14:33,163
- Okay. - You must sing it live.

418
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,433
- Sing from the top. - There's no point having music.

419
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:36,647
You have to sing this live without the music.

420
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:37,844
Some parts of the song are electronic dance music.

421
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:39,073
- 3, 4. - I see. This part is EDM.

422
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,942
(Actually, as for SEVENTEEN's song, "Home",)

423
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,783
(a trendy pop melody...)

424
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,491
(and sophisticated EDM accompaniment are the key points.)

425
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:52,984
- 3, 4. - I see. This part is EDM.

426
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:56,823
(Seungkwan's voice starts them off calmly.)

427
00:14:56,824 --> 00:15:00,224
(Mimicking EDM)

428
00:15:00,225 --> 00:15:02,456
(There's no problem in singing EDM songs.)

429
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:05,403
(They do their dance for "Home" as if nothing happened.)

430
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,050
- Great. - It went well with the song.

431
00:15:07,505 --> 00:15:08,573
This will go viral.

432
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,019
(It's very addicting.)

433
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,604
Things like this will go viral.

434
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,144
(They continue to perform like Masters of Performance.)

435
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,844
- There you go. This will go viral. - A place

436
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:16,014
- This will go viral. - Where you can cry

437
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,014
(All of a sudden, he explodes with his coolness.)

438
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,283
(Mingyu and Seungkwan are well-prepared and talented.)

439
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:20,984
- That was cool. - The mimicking was great.

440
00:15:20,985 --> 00:15:22,813
- That was so cool. - This will go viral.

441
00:15:22,814 --> 00:15:24,583
Singing it without the song was much better.

442
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:25,823
This will go viral.

443
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,814
Aren't you curious? It'd be great if you can listen to it.

444
00:15:27,954 --> 00:15:30,479
It's much better if you listen to the song.

445
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,024
That was so cool.

446
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:33,264
- They were so innocent. - Right.

447
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,494
- That was different. - Great.

448
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,333
- That was indeed different. - That was great.

449
00:15:36,334 --> 00:15:38,789
All right. We have SEVENTEEN and EXID with us.

450
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:41,303
These two teams are very strong front-runners...

451
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:43,254
- that could go viral online. - It's a real-time online trend.

452
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:44,803
- As for the next guest, - Who is it?

453
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:46,043
I've met this guest before.

454
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,543
But I'm sure some of you haven't met this guest yet.

455
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:48,913
Please. Come on out.

456
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,043
- Come on out. - Who is it?

457
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:51,933
(How popular will this guest be?)

458
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:54,783
- Hello. - It's Hye Yoon.

459
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,976
(She was the leading actress of the Castle Syndrome.)

460
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:01,094
(She's the trending actress from the trendy drama.)

461
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:02,754
(Today she joins Running Man to introduce herself as an actress,)

462
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,563
(not as her role, Ye Suh.)

463
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:06,443
- I really enjoyed your drama. - I see. My gosh.

464
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:09,663
- Really? - Isn't she Ye Suh?

465
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:10,833
- Ye Suh. Ye Suh. - Ye Suh is here.

466
00:16:10,834 --> 00:16:12,264
(I can't believe that "Ye Suh" is here.)

467
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:13,563
Nice to see you again.

468
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,033
- She's different from the drama. - Come this way.

469
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:17,533
- Listen. - Seriously.

470
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,774
- I didn't recognize her at first. - The name of the role...

471
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,471
- Hye Yoon played was Ye Suh. - Right.

472
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,505
But now that she's in this outfit,

473
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,043
- I bet you didn't recognize her. - She looks so different.

474
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,884
In the drama, she looked like a high school student.

475
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:30,453
But Hye Yoon isn't in high school.

476
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,854
- She's in college now. - She is?

477
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:33,024
- I graduated college. - She graduated.

478
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,124
- She graduated college? - That's right.

479
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:35,553
- Did you graduate this year? - Yes, yes.

480
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,024
- Really? - Congratulations.

481
00:16:37,025 --> 00:16:38,224
(Congratulations on your graduation.)

482
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:39,508
But she looks younger than her age.

483
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:42,094
Hye Yoon, please introduce yourself...

484
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:43,408
- to the viewers. - Okay.

485
00:16:43,564 --> 00:16:44,777
Okay.

486
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,227
Hello. I'm actress Kim Hye Yoon.

487
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,254
- She sounds just like Ye Suh. - Hold on. I...

488
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:55,216
(Ye Suh's version from "Sky Castle")

489
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,543
Hold on. I...

490
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:58,463
That was the only drama I watched as it aired.

491
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:01,783
After the drama, "Sky Castle" ended,

492
00:17:01,784 --> 00:17:03,471
aren't you busy with work?

493
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:06,045
Now that I graduated college,

494
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,296
I'm unemployed.

495
00:17:08,725 --> 00:17:10,224
- I haven't decided on a follow-up. - I see.

496
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:12,345
- She hasn't picked one. - Right, right.

497
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,312
- Don't you get many offers? - I bet you get many offers.

498
00:17:14,665 --> 00:17:16,093
I think I should work harder.

499
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,407
She just answered my question.

500
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,677
"No."

501
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,974
(We know how she's doing after the drama through body language.)

502
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:23,704
- It's not as many as we thought. - It's lower than we expected.

503
00:17:23,705 --> 00:17:25,204
- This happens. - Of course.

504
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:26,244
- I'll do my best. - It's because... Right.

505
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,744
The thing is that Hye Yoon...

506
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:30,774
- just started her career. - Right, right.

507
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,814
You must feel the popularity of the drama.

508
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,100
I felt how popular it was because I was invited to this show.

509
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:37,841
When you invited me here, that's when I felt it.

510
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,524
Everyone really liked it.

511
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,194
Everyone liked the drama,

512
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:42,793
but things move quickly in this industry.

513
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,309
- So the popularity disappears fast. - I see.

514
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:46,793
(Shooting out a harsh comment)

515
00:17:46,794 --> 00:17:47,863
- Why did you say that? - Hold on.

516
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,754
- What do you mean by that? - How could you say that?

517
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,421
- What's wrong with you? - You're so cold-hearted.

518
00:17:51,465 --> 00:17:52,563
- What's up with you? - Jae Seok.

519
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,918
Hye Yoon mentioned it first.

520
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,133
- Come on. - I was a huge fan of the drama.

521
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:57,234
- You know that, right? - Yes.

522
00:17:57,235 --> 00:17:58,720
I even memorized the lines.

523
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:01,613
Popularity comes and goes for dramas and variety shows.

524
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,573
- Everything changes so quickly. - That's true.

525
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:05,184
- Aren't I right? - You have a point.

526
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,014
- There are many new dramas. - Your point is valid.

527
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:09,613
But no drama has been as popular as "Sky Castle".

528
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:10,928
- No, not yet. - No.

529
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,469
Wherever I went, everyone talked about the drama.

530
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,353
Great. Actually, Hye Yoon,

531
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:17,623
did you know what kind of special...

532
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,024
- this was before you came here? - Yes.

533
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:20,393
- You know what it's about today. - Yes.

534
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,363
- We must go viral online. - Yes.

535
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,556
Have you ever been the most searched name online?

536
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,231
It happened when I was on a radio show recently.

537
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:28,803
Which radio show were you on?

538
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:30,652
It was "Kim Young Chul's Power FM".

539
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:32,043
- It was a morning show? - Yes, yes.

540
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,143
It's hard to go viral in the morning.

541
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,813
Actually, it is the easiest to go viral...

542
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,814
- during the morning shows. - Is that so?

543
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:41,684
(He shoots out his 2nd harsh comment)

544
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,383
(What's going on with him all of a sudden?)

545
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,083
- Can't you disagree just once? - What's wrong with you?

546
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:46,823
- Why can't you be nice for once? - What are you doing?

547
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:49,076
- You're being brutally honest. - Say that it's hard in the morning.

548
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:51,724
- Do it just this once. - Despite that...

549
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:52,823
(Feeling dizzy)

550
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:54,714
- By the way, he has his own style. - Come on.

551
00:18:55,064 --> 00:18:56,650
- I like this new style of his. - Right.

552
00:18:56,794 --> 00:18:59,533
- This is right up my alley. - Just this once! Come back!

553
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:00,934
- Wait. - Take care of your guest.

554
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:01,974
- Take care of her. - Please.

555
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,573
- Listen to me. - Okay.

556
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:05,191
Despite that,

557
00:19:05,205 --> 00:19:07,265
becoming the most-searched person isn't easy.

558
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:08,674
- It's not. - No.

559
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:09,744
- Right. - Yes.

560
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:14,244
She played the role of Ye Suh.

561
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,883
- It was an antagonist. - Right.

562
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:17,313
It's amazing how much...

563
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:18,739
- people love her. - I know.

564
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,174
Even though she was an antagonist, I didn't hate her.

565
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,467
She was good at acting.

566
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:25,323
What do you think was the reason?

567
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:26,576
The reason?

568
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:28,577
Was that a difficult question?

569
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:31,264
Stop hurting her feelings!

570
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:33,860
(What's wrong with you today?)

571
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,474
- What? - Why are you so fast?

572
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,633
- You've become wicked. - Why are you so fast today?

573
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,974
- You're so evil. - Come back!

574
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:40,043
Come back!

575
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,244
- My goodness. - Was I mean?

576
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,790
Don't stand next to each other!

577
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:45,783
(Jae Seok and Jong Kook, move away.)

578
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:47,543
You two shouldn't get along with each other.

579
00:19:47,544 --> 00:19:49,099
I like you today.

580
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:50,254
Was it all right?

581
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,454
- This is right up my alley. - Do you like it?

582
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:54,123
- He's so mean. - You should turn it down a notch.

583
00:19:54,124 --> 00:19:55,194
- Should I? - Yes, you were being too mean.

584
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,154
- You shouldn't change so abruptly. - Okay.

585
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,424
This is a mess.

586
00:19:58,425 --> 00:19:59,563
- Fine. - Gosh.

587
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:00,863
- That was hilarious. - Goodness.

588
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,593
All right. Hye Yoon will also attempt...

589
00:20:02,594 --> 00:20:04,234
to come first place for the real-time trending keywords.

590
00:20:04,235 --> 00:20:05,904
- Goodness. - She's a strong candidate.

591
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,234
- It's possible. - Yes.

592
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:09,023
- She's a strong candidate. - You're right.

593
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:11,744
All right. This is our last guest.

594
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:13,174
Let's bring her in.

595
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:14,256
Come in.

596
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:16,113
Han Bo Reum.

597
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,871
(She's full of charms.)

598
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:23,154
(With her charms, she has conquered the media.)

599
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,454
I really enjoy challenging myself in new areas.

600
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:28,283
The jungle was a place...

601
00:20:28,425 --> 00:20:29,954
that suited me.

602
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:33,323
I ride longboards, go bowling, and ride bicycles.

603
00:20:33,324 --> 00:20:35,293
I have various hobbies.

604
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:37,033
I like to be active.

605
00:20:37,034 --> 00:20:38,479
(Her charms are never-ending.)

606
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,164
Welcome.

607
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:42,286
Welcome, Bo Reum.

608
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:45,231
Bo Reum has appeared...

609
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:47,474
on several variety shows.

610
00:20:47,475 --> 00:20:49,514
And she's close...

611
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:51,313
- with many of our members. - Right.

612
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:52,843
She's close with Jong Kook too.

613
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:55,339
She was on "The Law of Jungle".

614
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:58,754
Bo Reum has many talents.

615
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:01,184
I'm close with Eom Hyun Kyung,

616
00:21:01,185 --> 00:21:03,043
and them two are good friends.

617
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,623
She's practically Hyun Kyung's dance teacher.

618
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:07,494
- Really? - She's very talented.

619
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:08,764
She's very good at dancing.

620
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,653
- She's good at rapping too. - Right.

621
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,704
She has licenses for skydiving,

622
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,855
- jazz dancing, - Really?

623
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,533
- grooming dogs, - Grooming dogs? What for?

624
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,103
- and making coffee. - Seriously?

625
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,274
She bowls, plays basketball, yoga, and lifts weights.

626
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,744
(She's multi-talented.)

627
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:25,214
Show us.

628
00:21:25,215 --> 00:21:27,062
Please rap and show us your jazz dance moves.

629
00:21:27,945 --> 00:21:29,514
- Rap for us first. - Rap?

630
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:30,914
- Rap? - Yes.

631
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,383
We're curious.

632
00:21:32,384 --> 00:21:34,848
Rap four lines for us.

633
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:36,323
I learned it a long time ago,

634
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,593
- so I don't remember much. - It can be an old one.

635
00:21:37,594 --> 00:21:38,694
It's all right.

636
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:39,893
(She's shy.)

637
00:21:39,894 --> 00:21:42,764
(Then suddenly, she transforms.)

638
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,755
(Don't care about the others)

639
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,126
(You have only one life to live)

640
00:21:47,465 --> 00:21:49,174
(I can't bear to watch.)

641
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:51,356
(I can't watch her.)

642
00:21:51,705 --> 00:21:52,904
(This old rap...)

643
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:55,036
(is too cringy for everyone.)

644
00:21:56,144 --> 00:21:57,143
(They cheer for her.)

645
00:21:57,144 --> 00:21:59,063
- That was good! - Go, Han Bo Reum!

646
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,337
(You did well.)

647
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:03,883
(I'm so embarrassed.)

648
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:04,894
- Bo Reum. - I can't stand it.

649
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,724
- Bo Reum. - My goodness.

650
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,067
Look at her.

651
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:11,194
Bo Reum, I guess you learned that a long time ago.

652
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:12,924
- You're right. - Did you see her face?

653
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,863
It completely changed when she rapped.

654
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:17,994
(Her performance was cringe-worthy.)

655
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:19,904
- Bo Reum. - She was like Yoon Mi Rae.

656
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,333
Now, please show us your jazz dance moves.

657
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:24,527
- Jazz dance? - Let's clap for her.

658
00:22:25,505 --> 00:22:27,244
(Music starts playing.)

659
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,557
You're amazing.

660
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,414
What should I do?

661
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,984
(She starts dancing.)

662
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,984
- She's good. - She is.

663
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,053
Oh, no.

664
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:38,892
(Unlike her rapping skills, she looks very professional.)

665
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:41,383
She's good.

666
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:42,971
- She is. - Yes.

667
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:44,777
(She dances alluringly.)

668
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:46,494
This is jazz dance.

669
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,605
(She dances alluringly.)

670
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:49,994
(She makes an elegant turn.)

671
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,278
I'm wearing a skirt.

672
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,888
Her dance moves look professional.

673
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:55,822
- She's good. - She is.

674
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:02,174
(However, she fails to do much and finishes.)

675
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:03,613
Wait.

676
00:23:03,614 --> 00:23:04,674
Bo Reum.

677
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,643
Why couldn't you show us much?

678
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:09,853
Why are you embarrassed?

679
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:11,654
- As I have mentioned, - It's disappointing.

680
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:14,424
Bo Reum is nervous right now.

681
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:17,051
- I know. - They're all so talented.

682
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:18,924
I think that's why, right?

683
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:19,994
Yes.

684
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:22,264
Let's just say you have ruined your opening.

685
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:23,577
(He lashes out again.)

686
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:27,464
(He shoots out a harsh comment once again.)

687
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:29,704
- Hey! - What's wrong with you?

688
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,018
It was all right!

689
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:33,373
- I'm scared! - He's becoming weirder.

690
00:23:33,374 --> 00:23:34,813
What's wrong with you today?

691
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:37,244
Jae Seok, what's wrong with you?

692
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:38,484
Why have you changed?

693
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,143
- I didn't change. - What's wrong with you?

694
00:23:40,144 --> 00:23:41,914
- It's not like that. - The great Jae Seok has changed.

695
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:43,313
Why would you criticize her?

696
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:44,754
- This is right up my alley. - She didn't show us much...

697
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,383
of herself.

698
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,754
- Bo Reum. - I'm disappointed.

699
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:49,793
He's trying to act like me.

700
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:51,239
What's gotten into you?

701
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:54,664
All right. Our last guest was Han Bo Reum.

702
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:55,833
We have six guests in total.

703
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,363
Please give them a round of applause.

704
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:59,504
(How will the teams be decided?)

705
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,033
They're all strong candidates.

706
00:24:01,034 --> 00:24:02,994
Everyone here is a strong candidate.

707
00:24:03,304 --> 00:24:05,364
The Running Man members...

708
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:07,343
can choose the guests they want...

709
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:08,543
to team up with.

710
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:09,914
- That's so hard. - However,

711
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,444
the guests are only allowed to pick two of them.

712
00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:14,444
(Only two members can be chosen.)

713
00:24:14,445 --> 00:24:16,273
This is going to be really difficult.

714
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,553
Whom should I pick?

715
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:20,383
(What will the outcome look like?)

716
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:22,194
We'll start with SEVENTEEN.

717
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:23,254
Go.

718
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:25,793
(They have the chance to become a team with this famous group.)

719
00:24:25,794 --> 00:24:28,087
(Which members will be on their team?)

720
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:29,331
Go.

721
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:33,423
(Nervous)

722
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,833
All right, you can look back now. 1, 2, 3.

723
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:39,096
(Who have come up?)

724
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,244
(Kwang Soo, Ji Hyo, So Min)

725
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,689
Great. Very nice.

726
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:44,933
Great. Very nice.

727
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,601
The moment I saw them,

728
00:24:48,044 --> 00:24:50,984
I knew they were the ones I wanted to team up with.

729
00:24:50,985 --> 00:24:52,623
- Why? - I knew it from the start.

730
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,371
- Good. - My goodness.

731
00:24:54,554 --> 00:24:55,694
How do we do this?

732
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,323
What he just said touched our hearts.

733
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:00,194
Look the other way, please.

734
00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:02,934
So Min, Ji Hyo, and Kwang Soo.

735
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,234
(They have a hard time deciding.)

736
00:25:05,235 --> 00:25:06,603
- Kwang Soo, you can be nervous. - Look at Kwang Soo.

737
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:07,833
- What? - Kwang Soo.

738
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,833
Really?

739
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,754
(Did SEVENTEEN make a surprising decision?)

740
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:13,269
(What is their choice?)

741
00:25:13,405 --> 00:25:14,744
1, 2, 3.

742
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:16,414
(Kwang Soo is eliminated.)

743
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:17,455
You're out.

744
00:25:18,314 --> 00:25:19,627
(I'm sorry.)

745
00:25:19,844 --> 00:25:22,339
(So Min and Ji Hyo are chosen.)

746
00:25:22,715 --> 00:25:24,053
(This is what he gets for hoping to win their favor.)

747
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:26,347
- Nice. - Nice.

748
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,353
- I'm so sorry. - Kwang Soo.

749
00:25:28,354 --> 00:25:29,654
I'm so sorry!

750
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:31,210
- I'm sorry. - Nice!

751
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:32,707
Nice!

752
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:35,087
- It's a nice team. - It is.

753
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:37,793
- Okay. - Next is Hye Yoon.

754
00:25:37,794 --> 00:25:39,249
(It's Hye Yoon's turn now.)

755
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,563
Hye Yoon.

756
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:42,019
- They'll come, right? - Hye Yoon.

757
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,095
We're running out of guests.

758
00:25:45,104 --> 00:25:46,444
- You're right. - Yes.

759
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,748
- We're running out of guests. - 1, 2, 3.

760
00:25:50,074 --> 00:25:51,862
2, 3.

761
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:55,954
(There seems to be a crowd approaching.)

762
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,113
Really?

763
00:25:57,114 --> 00:25:58,654
(Many of them have come.)

764
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:01,958
There are three duds.

765
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,494
(Hello, little girl.)

766
00:26:04,495 --> 00:26:06,182
Imagine if this was an actual blind date.

767
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:08,038
It's the worst.

768
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:10,916
Please turn around in 1, 2, 3.

769
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,333
- Hello. - Hi.

770
00:26:13,334 --> 00:26:14,363
- Hello. - It's nice to meet you.

771
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,294
(They're happy to see her.)

772
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,504
Hello.

773
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:18,655
I'm crying.

774
00:26:18,775 --> 00:26:19,885
All right.

775
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:21,419
- This is hilarious. - Okay.

776
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,460
- Please come over here. - This is funny.

777
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:26,444
- Please eliminate one of us. - Okay.

778
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:29,014
- It could even be 2 or 3. - Okay.

779
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,035
Seok Jin, do pushups in front of her.

780
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:32,724
- Yes. - Do it.

781
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,454
(You want me to show her my charms?)

782
00:26:34,455 --> 00:26:36,393
Do sit-ups or pushups.

783
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,414
(He gets down.)

784
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,885
(He shows off his strength.)

785
00:26:41,765 --> 00:26:44,734
(He even jumps in the middle.)

786
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:46,934
(Was this necessary?)

787
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,704
Can you clap midair?

788
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:49,704
Clap.

789
00:26:49,705 --> 00:26:51,303
(Slamming)

790
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:53,143
- I heard that! - My gosh.

791
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,204
Clap.

792
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:56,043
(He slams his chest on the floor.)

793
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:57,543
- I heard that! - My gosh.

794
00:26:57,544 --> 00:26:58,984
Something broke!

795
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,343
- It hurts. - I heard that.

796
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,643
Something broke in him.

797
00:27:01,644 --> 00:27:03,414
(That's enough.)

798
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:06,053
This time, I'll do sit-ups.

799
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:07,224
(I'll show you my sit-ups.)

800
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,720
(Jae Seok follows Seok Jin and shows off his charms.)

801
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:12,194
All right.

802
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,538
- How is this showing your charms? - What is this?

803
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,164
What are they doing?

804
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,508
I'll join!

805
00:27:16,695 --> 00:27:19,204
(Kwang Soo performs squats.)

806
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,504
(The studio turns into a gym.)

807
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:21,990
It's working!

808
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:23,873
My gosh.

809
00:27:23,874 --> 00:27:25,373
(Being healthy is the best for men like them.)

810
00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:26,843
They do look attractive.

811
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,444
(I'll do anything to team up with Hye Yoon.)

812
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:30,974
- All right. - You're good.

813
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:32,914
- I've made a decision. - Good.

814
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:34,414
You can eliminate just one of us.

815
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,636
(After watching them perform, she has made a decision.)

816
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:38,954
Go.

817
00:27:38,955 --> 00:27:40,283
(She stands behind one of them.)

818
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:41,537
Are you sure?

819
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,217
(Ji Hyo is surprised by Hye Yoon's pick.)

820
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,322
(She hesitates behind Jae Seok.)

821
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:48,764
- Really? - I'm sorry.

822
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:50,915
(Seok Jin is eliminated.)

823
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:54,969
(He's eliminated even before he can dry his sweat.)

824
00:27:55,435 --> 00:27:56,573
(You've made a wise decision.)

825
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,969
- I feel so bad. - Seok Jin, you did well.

826
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:01,871
The entire country now knows that you're healthy.

827
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:03,560
You showed them your strength.

828
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:06,502
Next is Bo Reum.

829
00:28:07,584 --> 00:28:08,754
(He does pushups once again.)

830
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:10,028
That's good!

831
00:28:10,185 --> 00:28:11,214
Good!

832
00:28:11,215 --> 00:28:12,283
(He puts down his knees and finally manages to clap.)

833
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:14,654
(But he is eliminated once again.)

834
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:15,766
Okay!

835
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,754
- Welcome! - Okay!

836
00:28:17,755 --> 00:28:19,885
- You're my role model! - Welcome!

837
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,323
Come here.

838
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,734
(Team SEVENTEEN, Team EXID,)

839
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,063
- Okay! - Yes!

840
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:26,124
(Team Hye Yoon, Team Bo Reum)

841
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,282
What is this?

842
00:28:28,334 --> 00:28:29,546
I'm worried.

843
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,873
- There's water. - I know.

844
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:34,004
(There are 4 water bombs.)

845
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,842
For this round, we have water bombs.

846
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:38,583
This mission is called a Pyramid Quiz.

847
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,143
(Pyramid Quiz)

848
00:28:40,144 --> 00:28:41,414
- Pyramid Quiz? - Pyramid Quiz?

849
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,484
Pyramid Quiz.

850
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,373
- There are many levels. - It'll get harder and harder.

851
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,224
You need to guess the top songs for each generation.

852
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,293
I'm good at this.

853
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,314
- Oh, are you? - Yes.

854
00:28:51,394 --> 00:28:52,724
- Gosh. - We can do this.

855
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:53,924
- Yes. - You can do well, right?

856
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:55,593
- You can do well, right? - We have three generations.

857
00:28:55,594 --> 00:28:57,333
- It's true. - You're right.

858
00:28:57,334 --> 00:29:01,033
If you know the answer, press the buzzer.

859
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,803
Then, we'll show you a scene from a drama.

860
00:29:02,804 --> 00:29:05,774
Whoever can reenact that scene well...

861
00:29:05,775 --> 00:29:07,319
will have the opportunity to answer.

862
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:09,914
I'll do it.

863
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,086
This is...

864
00:29:11,415 --> 00:29:12,514
Do we have to reenact it well?

865
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:13,714
- We do? - Okay.

866
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,184
Except for the team that gets it right,

867
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:17,654
all the others' water bombs will rise a notch.

868
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:21,224
(The water bombs will go up one notch.)

869
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,921
- My goodness. - Five notches, and it'll pour out.

870
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:26,040
That's scary.

871
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,924
- This is nerve-racking. - Once it reaches five notches,

872
00:29:27,925 --> 00:29:29,063
it'll pour out.

873
00:29:29,064 --> 00:29:31,084
I'll tell you what the first place winner gets.

874
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:32,904
From the moment you win...

875
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:34,603
until the start of the next mission,

876
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:36,573
your team's name will be shown on the center top of the monitor.

877
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,099
- Goodness. - That'll really help us go viral.

878
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,364
Okay, okay!

879
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:43,873
- This is good. - This will help a lot.

880
00:29:43,874 --> 00:29:45,414
We'll hear your chants before starting.

881
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:47,313
- We'll start first. - All right.

882
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:48,813
- Ready, set, go. - Ready, set, go.

883
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:51,684
- Han Bo Reum is on Running Man - Han Bo Reum is on Running Man

884
00:29:51,685 --> 00:29:52,954
- She's on Running Man - She's on Running Man

885
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:53,965
Okay!

886
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,323
- That's so long. - What was that?

887
00:29:57,324 --> 00:29:59,664
- This is our chant. - What's important is that...

888
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,058
- her name should be searched. - Okay, okay.

889
00:30:02,064 --> 00:30:04,234
- Start. So Min. - Ji Hyo.

890
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,664
- SEVENTEEN, very nice! - SEVENTEEN, very nice!

891
00:30:06,665 --> 00:30:09,504
We will come first place

892
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:11,495
(He ends it with the wi-fi technique.)

893
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:14,504
(I like their chant.)

894
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:15,514
All right.

895
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:17,143
Ready, set, go!

896
00:30:17,144 --> 00:30:18,684
Our age groups are

897
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:20,883
- Up, down, up, up, down - Up, down, up, up, down

898
00:30:20,884 --> 00:30:22,954
(He's very old, and they're very young.)

899
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:24,754
That's why we have an advantage!

900
00:30:24,755 --> 00:30:25,783
(Their team is full of various age groups.)

901
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:26,924
EXID!

902
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,399
- Hye Yoon is the best - Hye Yoon is the best

903
00:30:29,755 --> 00:30:31,224
That's mine!

904
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,224
(They steal her song.)

905
00:30:32,225 --> 00:30:34,293
(Hye Yoon is the best)

906
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:37,497
- Hye Yoon is the best - Hye Yoon is the best

907
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:39,984
They're stealing everything!

908
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:42,404
- That wasn't bad. - You're too harsh!

909
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,934
- No, I'm not. - It's our chant.

910
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,504
Here comes the first question.

911
00:30:46,505 --> 00:30:48,573
I'll show you a scene from a drama,

912
00:30:48,574 --> 00:30:50,214
and if you think you can do it,

913
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,557
- press the buzzer. - Okay.

914
00:30:51,844 --> 00:30:53,914
In 1993...

915
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:55,228
I was in 11th grade.

916
00:30:55,485 --> 00:30:56,853
I wasn't even born.

917
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:58,583
On June 27th,

918
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:01,454
which song came first place on "Inkigayo"?

919
00:31:01,455 --> 00:31:04,051
One. "Anyhow" by Seo Taiji and Boys.

920
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:07,093
Two. "What I Want From You" by Noise.

921
00:31:07,094 --> 00:31:08,407
(Is this one right?)

922
00:31:09,195 --> 00:31:12,934
Three. "Never Stop" by ZAM.

923
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,278
(This one's not it.)

924
00:31:14,564 --> 00:31:17,402
Four. "What Is Life" by Lee Mu Song.

925
00:31:17,604 --> 00:31:20,073
- The scene for... - The scene isn't out yet.

926
00:31:20,074 --> 00:31:22,165
The scene for this question...

927
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:23,714
is this.

928
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,113
("Lovers in Paris")

929
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:26,428
- Let me answer! - What is it?

930
00:31:26,614 --> 00:31:27,928
"Why can't..."

931
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,353
"Why can't you say it?"

932
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,576
- "Why can't you say it?" - "Why can't you say it?"

933
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:33,553
You need to do it right.

934
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:35,123
- He's not doing it well. - Do it right.

935
00:31:35,124 --> 00:31:37,194
- There's more to it. - That wasn't right.

936
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,205
(They know the answer.)

937
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,563
(From "Lovers in Paris")

938
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:47,958
("Why can't you say that I'm yours?")

939
00:31:48,034 --> 00:31:49,833
- "Why can't you say it?" - "Why can't you say it?"

940
00:31:49,834 --> 00:31:53,043
You failed to pull it off. So Min?

941
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:56,843
"Let's go pig!" No, wait.

942
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:58,214
"Let's go, baby!"

943
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:00,484
- Wait. - Where did you get the pig?

944
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,583
- What the pig? - What was that?

945
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:03,914
(The overweight producer made her say that.)

946
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:05,853
- Hold on. - I know it!

947
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:07,904
- Go, Kwang Soo. - It's our turn.

948
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,893
"Why can't you say it?"

949
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:11,843
- "Why can't you say I'm yours?" - "Why can't you say I'm yours?"

950
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:13,563
- "Why can't you say it?" - "Why can't you say it?"

951
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,939
"Let's go, baby!"

952
00:32:15,025 --> 00:32:16,984
- Correct. - Okay!

953
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:18,494
That's not right.

954
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:19,677
(Why couldn't we say anything?)

955
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:21,664
(Which choice will Team Hye Yoon pick?)

956
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,715
Hye Yoon, wait.

957
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,393
- It's "Anyhow". - Five,

958
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:27,704
- 4, 3. - It's number one.

959
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,937
- "Anyhow" by Seo Taiji and Boys. - "Anyhow" by Seo Taiji and Boys.

960
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:32,398
(They're wrong.)

961
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,414
- It's us. - It's us.

962
00:32:35,415 --> 00:32:37,940
- Okay. - Say the lines.

963
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,700
"Why can't you say it?"

964
00:32:39,784 --> 00:32:42,047
- "That I'm yours?" - "Why can't you say that..."

965
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:44,575
- "I'm yours?" - "I'm yours?"

966
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:46,093
"Let's go, baby!"

967
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,924
- "Let's go, baby!" - Hey.

968
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,450
He looks stupid.

969
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,593
- He looks like an idiot. - "Let's go, baby!"

970
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,453
- This doesn't count. - "Let's go, baby!"

971
00:32:53,665 --> 00:32:55,234
Good. It's number two.

972
00:32:55,235 --> 00:32:56,385
- Noise. - Noise.

973
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:58,873
- It's number 2. - It's "What I Want From You"...

974
00:32:58,874 --> 00:33:00,016
by Noise.

975
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:01,404
No?

976
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:02,474
(They're wrong as well.)

977
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:03,990
- Darn it. - It's us!

978
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:05,813
- Go, Hani. - "Why can't you say it?"

979
00:33:05,814 --> 00:33:08,083
"Why can't you say that I'm yours?"

980
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:09,154
- "Let's go, baby." - That's great.

981
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,714
- Okay! - It's number four.

982
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,083
- It's number 4. - It's number 4.

983
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:14,383
- "What Is Life" by Lee Mu Song. - "What Is Life" by Lee Mu Song.

984
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:16,393
("What Is Life" by Lee Mu Song)

985
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:18,678
(They get it right.)

986
00:33:19,394 --> 00:33:21,213
No way.

987
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:24,217
(We know this song.)

988
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:27,504
(They have a victorious ceremony.)

989
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,525
(We're the best.)

990
00:33:30,134 --> 00:33:34,549
(We want to be on the real-time trending chart!)

991
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,425
We did it!

992
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:39,083
- I think we'll win! - Good work.

993
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,257
(What will happen to our team?)

994
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:42,254
Look at that.

995
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:43,254
(Their water bombs go up a notch.)

996
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,654
This is great.

997
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:45,766
(Their water levels rise one notch.)

998
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,366
The water level is rising.

999
00:33:47,685 --> 00:33:48,695
Let's go.

1000
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,393
Here's the second question.

1001
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:52,563
In 1992...

1002
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,694
That was when I was born.

1003
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,653
- I wasn't even born. - You can do it.

1004
00:33:55,995 --> 00:33:57,549
"I Know" was released then.

1005
00:33:57,564 --> 00:34:01,303
On November 3rd, which song came first place?

1006
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:04,333
One. "You, Who Doesn't Answer" by Kim Jong Seo.

1007
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,774
(We do recognize the song.)

1008
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,472
Two. "Towards Tomorrow" by Shin Sung Woo.

1009
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:09,873
Hold on.

1010
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,025
Excuse me.

1011
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,568
Hye Yoon doesn't know either of them.

1012
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:15,431
- She's never heard of them. - Seriously.

1013
00:34:15,785 --> 00:34:19,157
Three. "You, in the Fantasy" by Seo Taiji and Boys.

1014
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:23,094
Four. "You Are In My Dim Memory" by Hyun Jin Young.

1015
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:26,024
This is the scene for this question.

1016
00:34:26,025 --> 00:34:27,307
("Rustic Period")

1017
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:28,933
What?

1018
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,063
(They know this scene.)

1019
00:34:30,064 --> 00:34:31,194
Go.

1020
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,780
(What scene is this?)

1021
00:34:32,905 --> 00:34:37,504
(During a wage negotiation with the American army,)

1022
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:40,808
(Kim Yeong Cheol wanted 4 dollars.)

1023
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,939
(He was curt and demanded 4 dollars.)

1024
00:34:44,814 --> 00:34:46,614
- "4 dollars". - "4 dollars".

1025
00:34:46,615 --> 00:34:47,999
- "4 dollars". - Correct!

1026
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:50,214
- Which one? - It's number one.

1027
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,003
- It's number one. - So this is how you do it.

1028
00:34:52,285 --> 00:34:53,583
- It's number 1. - It's number 1.

1029
00:34:53,584 --> 00:34:55,324
"You, Who Doesn't Answer" by Kim Jong Seo.

1030
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:57,113
("You, Who Doesn't Answer" by Kim Jong Seo)

1031
00:34:57,624 --> 00:34:59,063
- It's number 1. - It's number 1.

1032
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,464
(Seok Jin's certain.)

1033
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,594
(Will they get this one correct as well?)

1034
00:35:01,595 --> 00:35:04,160
Number one, "You, Who Doesn't Answer" by Kim Jong Seo.

1035
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,226
(They're wrong.)

1036
00:35:09,405 --> 00:35:11,353
Let us answer!

1037
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:12,904
- Us! - Us!

1038
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,203
- All right. - "Four dollars".

1039
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:16,043
- "Four dollars". - "Four dollars".

1040
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:17,143
"Okay, thank you."

1041
00:35:17,144 --> 00:35:19,063
- "Four dollars". - "Okay, thank you."

1042
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:20,731
- "Okay, thank you." - Number three.

1043
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,254
"You, in the Fantasy" by Seo Taiji.

1044
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:23,784
He said, "Seo Taiji".

1045
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,083
- He said, "Seo Taiji". - Seo Taiji and Boys.

1046
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:26,484
- Seo Taiji and Boys. - Be clear.

1047
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,784
- "You, in the Fantasy"... - "You, in the Fantasy"...

1048
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,094
- by Seo Taiji and Boys. - by Seo Taiji and Boys.

1049
00:35:29,095 --> 00:35:30,324
- Which number? - Number three.

1050
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:31,654
(They articulate.)

1051
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:35,503
(Team Hye Yoon gets it right.)

1052
00:35:36,035 --> 00:35:37,234
(I knew it.)

1053
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,504
I mentioned that one.

1054
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,585
I told you it was that one.

1055
00:35:41,664 --> 00:35:43,074
You are

1056
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,993
(They have a victorious ceremony.)

1057
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:47,497
(They know the lyrics.)

1058
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:51,714
(Hye Yoon was born 4 years after this song was released.)

1059
00:35:51,715 --> 00:35:54,913
(She doesn't know the choreography.)

1060
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:56,583
- Do you know this song? - No.

1061
00:35:56,584 --> 00:35:57,726
(She's happy.)

1062
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,123
- They're rising. - We did it.

1063
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:04,326
(The other teams' water bombs go up a notch.)

1064
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:07,493
- Hye Yoon is the best - Hye Yoon is the best

1065
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:10,767
- Hye Yoon is the best - Hye Yoon is the best

1066
00:36:11,635 --> 00:36:12,964
- Look at them. They stole it. - Here we go.

1067
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:15,226
- This is a recent one. - Okay.

1068
00:36:16,035 --> 00:36:18,873
- In 2018, - I can get this one.

1069
00:36:18,874 --> 00:36:21,703
July 8th, which song came first place...

1070
00:36:21,704 --> 00:36:23,714
- on "Inkigayo"? - It's definitely TWICE.

1071
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,230
- One. - It has to be.

1072
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:27,537
"IDOL" by BTS.

1073
00:36:27,615 --> 00:36:28,813
(No, that came out later.)

1074
00:36:28,814 --> 00:36:31,884
Two. "Ddudu Ddudu" by BLACKPINK.

1075
00:36:31,885 --> 00:36:33,083
Didn't that one come out earlier?

1076
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:34,683
- Three. - I don't think it's that one.

1077
00:36:34,684 --> 00:36:36,993
Three. "Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND.

1078
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,054
It could be that one.

1079
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:40,994
Four. "Love Scenario" by iKON.

1080
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,755
The scene for this question is this.

1081
00:36:44,294 --> 00:36:45,493
What is that?

1082
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,103
- "Trap of Youth". - "I'll..."

1083
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,504
(They know it.)

1084
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:49,603
"I'll destroy you."

1085
00:36:49,604 --> 00:36:50,817
(Ji Hyo thinks it's right.)

1086
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:54,703
("Trap of Youth")

1087
00:36:54,704 --> 00:36:58,279
(I'll destroy you.)

1088
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:01,344
"I'll destroy you."

1089
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,813
(She puts her heart into it.)

1090
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:04,633
- You're... You're right. - We'll answer now.

1091
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:06,384
- Which one? - Which one?

1092
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:08,284
- It's 1 of those 2. - Gosh, let me think.

1093
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:10,754
- It's either 4 or 5. - He was the emcee.

1094
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:13,293
I was the emcee and gave the award myself.

1095
00:37:13,294 --> 00:37:14,506
(Mingyu was an emcee on "Inkigayo".)

1096
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:18,975
(On that very day, he announced the winner.)

1097
00:37:19,164 --> 00:37:22,234
(What is his answer?)

1098
00:37:22,235 --> 00:37:23,922
Number three. "Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND.

1099
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:26,424
Right, he was the emcee.

1100
00:37:26,775 --> 00:37:27,873
Then he'd know for sure.

1101
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:28,884
(He should know.)

1102
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:31,873
("Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND)

1103
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,013
(He gets it wrong.)

1104
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:35,933
(The emcee fails to remember.)

1105
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,154
It's number two.

1106
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:39,498
- It's not number 4. - It's number 2.

1107
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:41,754
- Is it number four? - I'm so mad.

1108
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,453
- I think it's number 2. - Number 2?

1109
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:45,223
- Really? - I think that's right.

1110
00:37:45,224 --> 00:37:47,082
- Bo Reum. - Okay!

1111
00:37:47,394 --> 00:37:48,424
Okay.

1112
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:50,134
"I will destroy you!"

1113
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,234
Good job!

1114
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,864
(She reenacts the scene perfectly.)

1115
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,333
- Good. - Great.

1116
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:55,804
- It's number two. - What do you mean?

1117
00:37:55,805 --> 00:37:57,074
- It's BLACKPINK. - Yes.

1118
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:59,024
- It's number 2. - No, it's number 4.

1119
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:03,413
(Which one will they pick?)

1120
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,714
It's number two, BLACKPINK.

1121
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,114
- "Ddudu Ddudu" by BLACKPINK. - "Ddudu Ddudu".

1122
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:08,714
(She's not confident.)

1123
00:38:08,715 --> 00:38:09,897
("Ddudu Ddudu" by BLACKPINK)

1124
00:38:10,285 --> 00:38:11,513
We were right.

1125
00:38:11,514 --> 00:38:13,223
(They get it right.)

1126
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:14,384
Do you remember the dance move?

1127
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:15,384
(It's time to celebrate.)

1128
00:38:15,385 --> 00:38:16,940
(They fire their guns.)

1129
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:19,623
(She mimics it perfectly.)

1130
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:21,412
(He looks silly.)

1131
00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:23,550
(They're happy to have gotten it right.)

1132
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,203
(I can dance well as well.)

1133
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:27,518
- Okay. - My goodness.

1134
00:38:28,965 --> 00:38:30,853
We did it!

1135
00:38:31,204 --> 00:38:33,074
We got it right. What a relief.

1136
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:34,873
(The other teams' water bombs go up another notch.)

1137
00:38:34,874 --> 00:38:37,513
- I knew the answer. - I know the dance moves.

1138
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:39,913
Hye Yoon would like...

1139
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:41,257
- to dance to it. - She knows the choreography.

1140
00:38:41,414 --> 00:38:43,614
- Yes, please allow her. - This is all you need to know.

1141
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:44,714
- This is it. - Yes.

1142
00:38:44,715 --> 00:38:45,998
(Give it a try, Hye Yoon.)

1143
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,683
(She loads her guns...)

1144
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:48,683
What was it?

1145
00:38:48,684 --> 00:38:50,493
(and fires.)

1146
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,222
(She did a good job firing guns.)

1147
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,063
She's so cute.

1148
00:38:55,064 --> 00:38:56,094
(What is this?)

1149
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:57,751
(She looks like she's washing her face with hands.)

1150
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:02,674
(Her moves seem somewhat awkward despite her confidence.)

1151
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,786
She's so cute!

1152
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,034
She's so cute.

1153
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:06,274
(Even she thinks it's funny.)

1154
00:39:06,275 --> 00:39:08,174
- Hold on a minute. - Excuse me, Jae Seok.

1155
00:39:08,175 --> 00:39:09,944
- I apologize. - Jae Seok.

1156
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,243
- What is this supposed to be? - Sorry, but...

1157
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:12,698
- what is she doing? - Are you introducing someone?

1158
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:14,502
I thought she'd be really good. I'm sorry.

1159
00:39:14,584 --> 00:39:15,853
- What is this? - Hye Yoon!

1160
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,905
- Why didn't you say you're bad? - Why did you do that?

1161
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:19,600
I'll focus on my acting.

1162
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:20,924
- Hye Yoon, this is... - I'll show you my acting.

1163
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,694
Why did you even volunteer to do that?

1164
00:39:22,695 --> 00:39:23,993
It seemed like she'd be really good.

1165
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,024
(By the looks of it, it seemed like she'd be really good.)

1166
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:26,579
- She went like this. - No.

1167
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:30,864
(While Team Bo Reum was going crazy with the guns,)

1168
00:39:30,865 --> 00:39:34,641
(she was acting like a pro. "Gosh! This is right up my alley.")

1169
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,923
- She went like this. - Isn't it like this?

1170
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:38,951
Goodness! She's so cute!

1171
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:40,086
- Isn't it like this? - Gosh.

1172
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:42,473
Isn't this the "Bebeto Celebration" from the World Cup?

1173
00:39:42,474 --> 00:39:44,873
(Is it the "Bebeto Celebration" from the 1994 World Cup?)

1174
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:46,833
That's so old.

1175
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:48,900
(They look exactly the same though.)

1176
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:51,000
The "Bebeto Celebration"...

1177
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:52,554
That's so old.

1178
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,484
- I'll focus on my acting. - Isn't it the "Bebeto Celebration"?

1179
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:55,723
I'll focus on my acting.

1180
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:57,793
- It's been so long. - She's so cute.

1181
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:58,905
It's great to see that again.

1182
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:00,336
Next question.

1183
00:40:00,494 --> 00:40:01,908
In 2006...

1184
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:04,549
- It's worth trying. - I'm sure it's Ivy.

1185
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,763
- The Germany World Cup. - The number 1 song on August 13?

1186
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:09,553
That was when I watched TV a lot in the army.

1187
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:10,873
Me too. I was also in the army back then.

1188
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:13,672
Number one, "I Won't Love" by Baek Ji Young.

1189
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,543
Number two, "You Don't Know Men" by Buzz.

1190
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:19,074
- That's not it. - It's later on.

1191
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:21,812
Number three, "Celebrity" by PSY.

1192
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:25,313
Number four, "On The Street" by Sung Si Kyung.

1193
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:27,072
- It's number two. - The scene for this question...

1194
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,235
is this.

1195
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,953
- What's this? - I know this one.

1196
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:33,424
(The scene that So Min is so confident about is...)

1197
00:40:33,425 --> 00:40:34,505
What is that?

1198
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:38,165
Since when were you this pretty, Gil Ra Im?

1199
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:40,016
Last year?

1200
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:44,231
"Gil Ra Im, since when were you this pretty?"

1201
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,267
- Correct. - Hurry up, say the answer.

1202
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,504
"On The Street" by Sung Si Kyung.

1203
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:49,756
- "On The Street"? - Is it?

1204
00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:51,143
- Number four! - No, wait.

1205
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:52,813
- Number four! - No, wait just a minute.

1206
00:40:52,814 --> 00:40:53,813
Trust me on this one...

1207
00:40:53,814 --> 00:40:54,855
"Celebrity" by PSY.

1208
00:40:55,314 --> 00:40:57,072
- They're fighting. - That's not right.

1209
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,154
He went for "Celebrity" by PSY.

1210
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:01,324
Number three, "Celebrity" by PSY!

1211
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:02,324
This is Seungkwan's personal...

1212
00:41:02,325 --> 00:41:03,637
- Nice! - We got it!

1213
00:41:04,695 --> 00:41:05,964
(See? Wasn't it a good thing that you trusted me?)

1214
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:07,493
- He got it right! - Isn't it "On The Street"?

1215
00:41:07,494 --> 00:41:09,717
That's right. It's "Celebrity" by PSY.

1216
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:11,234
That's the answer?

1217
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:12,376
(Something up there doesn't feel right...)

1218
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:14,703
- We need to jump! - I will be your celebrity

1219
00:41:14,704 --> 00:41:16,623
(He copies the dance moves.)

1220
00:41:16,905 --> 00:41:19,732
(I danced to this song in my earlier days.)

1221
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:22,264
(Singing hard)

1222
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,533
(Flip)

1223
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,607
(I'll do all the tricks for you.)

1224
00:41:28,845 --> 00:41:30,114
(Good job, Seungkwan. Very nice.)

1225
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,754
- All together! - It's a concert.

1226
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,179
(The uncle fans come forward. I'll be your Bebeto.)

1227
00:41:34,854 --> 00:41:37,419
(Is everyone finished dancing? I'll finish it off.)

1228
00:41:37,825 --> 00:41:39,424
(What? She suddenly takes her jacket off.)

1229
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,524
- Who is it? - Who is it?

1230
00:41:40,525 --> 00:41:42,364
- What's up with So Min? - Who is it?

1231
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:44,385
- It's PSY's signature move. - Yes.

1232
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:45,915
Celebrity!

1233
00:41:46,064 --> 00:41:47,404
- It's filling up. - We made it.

1234
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:49,222
- Good job! - That's unbelievable.

1235
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,016
We're almost there.

1236
00:41:51,035 --> 00:41:52,703
- We're doomed. - We each got one right.

1237
00:41:52,704 --> 00:41:55,028
- We're all tied. - It's 3 to 3 to 3 to 3.

1238
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,228
We're all pretty much the same.

1239
00:41:58,175 --> 00:42:00,235
- We can do it. - We can do it.

1240
00:42:00,314 --> 00:42:01,396
Let's move on.

1241
00:42:01,914 --> 00:42:04,137
In 1996.

1242
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:05,583
That's when you were popular as Turbo.

1243
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,424
- It's the era of Jong Kook. - You should know.

1244
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:08,754
It's during the second album of Turbo.

1245
00:42:08,755 --> 00:42:11,393
- On February 2, - That's during the winter time.

1246
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:12,924
which song won first place?

1247
00:42:12,925 --> 00:42:15,723
Number one, "Sad Promise" by Kim Jung Min.

1248
00:42:16,164 --> 00:42:17,851
Now

1249
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:21,337
Number two, "Black Cat Nero" by Turbo.

1250
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,986
Is that right?

1251
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:26,842
Number three, "Winter Story" by DJ DOC.

1252
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:30,577
Number four, "Aspirin" by Girl.

1253
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:33,813
- The scene for this question... - This is also an old song.

1254
00:42:34,215 --> 00:42:35,543
- is this. - What's this?

1255
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:36,913
- It's "Descendants of The Sun". - It's "Descendants of The Sun".

1256
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:38,733
Kwang Soo will get this right.

1257
00:42:39,655 --> 00:42:41,024
He should have it memorized.

1258
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:42,524
(Lee Kwang Soo, an actor in "Descendants of The Sun".)

1259
00:42:42,525 --> 00:42:43,924
The lines for this one are hard.

1260
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:45,440
Yes. I saw it, but I don't remember the lines.

1261
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:47,281
Me! I remember a line.

1262
00:42:47,425 --> 00:42:48,524
Yes, a famous line.

1263
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,312
- "A doctor is..." What? - I'm the soldier.

1264
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,603
"If you're a doctor, you must not have a boyfriend."

1265
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:55,263
("If you're a doctor, you must not have a boyfriend.")

1266
00:42:55,264 --> 00:42:56,446
"You must be busy, since you're a soldier."

1267
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:58,703
What? Why?

1268
00:42:58,704 --> 00:43:00,373
- Your face is too different. - My face is different?

1269
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:01,603
(Sorry, but your face is too different.)

1270
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:03,543
(The staff cannot ignore their conscience.)

1271
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:04,944
- Wait a minute! - Wait!

1272
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:06,543
- Then what should I do? - You can't do this!

1273
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:07,583
Your face is too different.

1274
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:09,937
(Put side by side, it is too different.)

1275
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:11,353
- You do it! - The famous line!

1276
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:12,353
(Jong Kook, the least different, should do it!)

1277
00:43:12,354 --> 00:43:13,884
- "I'm able to manage it." - "I'm able to manage it."

1278
00:43:13,885 --> 00:43:15,784
"I'm able to manage the difficult."

1279
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:17,024
Correct.

1280
00:43:17,025 --> 00:43:19,763
(Correct, since the staff feels less guilty about it.)

1281
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,138
- Let's go. - It's number two.

1282
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:23,586
Number two, "Black Cat Nero" by Turbo.

1283
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:25,876
It can't be.

1284
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:27,833
- What? - Press it.

1285
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,632
(They are all tied and he picks his own song. Will it be correct?)

1286
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:35,103
("Black Cat Nero" by Turbo is correct.)

1287
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:36,513
- Was it February? - It was February.

1288
00:43:36,514 --> 00:43:38,844
- "Black Cat Nero" came out in 1996? - It was right.

1289
00:43:38,845 --> 00:43:41,138
(Now Team Bo Reum is in the lead.)

1290
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,813
Let's go!

1291
00:43:42,814 --> 00:43:44,013
(Calling for Nero for the first time in a while.)

1292
00:43:44,014 --> 00:43:45,701
(The perfect coordination of the original singer.)

1293
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,499
(Team Bo Reum is the best.)

1294
00:43:48,454 --> 00:43:50,576
(The winning cats dance in glee!)

1295
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:54,964
(Let's not mind the water bomb and just dance for now.)

1296
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:59,763
(The naughty cat is bringing up the keyword.)

1297
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:00,904
Are you Turbo?

1298
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:02,663
(Are you Turbo? I'm doing Kim Jung Nam's part!)

1299
00:44:02,664 --> 00:44:03,786
I'm Kim Jung Nam.

1300
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:07,043
(Team Bo Reum stays put,)

1301
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,274
(while the rest fills up another notch.)

1302
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,813
If Team Bo Reum gets another one right,

1303
00:44:12,814 --> 00:44:14,183
they win right away.

1304
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:15,527
Okay, let's finish it!

1305
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,868
- We can do it. - Let's make them be quiet.

1306
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:20,437
We have to get this one right.

1307
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:21,924
- We should. - We won't come in first, right?

1308
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,054
- We can do it. - Still...

1309
00:44:23,055 --> 00:44:24,123
Next,

1310
00:44:24,124 --> 00:44:26,285
- in 2009. - Oh, 2009.

1311
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,464
- We can do it. - It's ten years ago.

1312
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:30,194
- Right. - Yes. I was 14.

1313
00:44:30,195 --> 00:44:31,710
- In grade seven. - On May 3,

1314
00:44:31,834 --> 00:44:34,288
- which song won first place? - In 2009?

1315
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:36,134
I'll give you the scene first.

1316
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:37,447
For this question, it is...

1317
00:44:39,275 --> 00:44:41,426
"I thought I could have you if I acted this way."

1318
00:44:41,505 --> 00:44:42,655
What's the answer?

1319
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,043
No, he was just testing.

1320
00:44:44,044 --> 00:44:45,574
(We didn't hear the choices.)

1321
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:46,984
All right.

1322
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,428
- I'll try it, then. - I'll give you the choices.

1323
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,524
Number one,

1324
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:52,003
"8282" by Davichi.

1325
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:54,070
- I think this is it. - This is a good song.

1326
00:44:55,055 --> 00:44:57,983
Number two, "Sorry, Sorry" by Super Junior.

1327
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:02,897
Number three, "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi.

1328
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:07,464
Number four, "Again and Again" by 2PM.

1329
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:09,034
- We're ready! Mingyu is ready! - Us!

1330
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:10,973
- "I thought I could..." - "I thought I could..."

1331
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:13,166
"I thought I could have you if I acted this way."

1332
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:17,473
(From the drama, "Sandglass".)

1333
00:45:17,474 --> 00:45:19,743
(The line goes, "I thought I could have you if I acted this way.")

1334
00:45:19,744 --> 00:45:20,784
- Come on out. - What number is it?

1335
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,531
"I thought I could get it right."

1336
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:24,083
Number four, 2PM.

1337
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:26,609
- "Again and Again" by 2PM. - "Again and Again".

1338
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:28,623
It's correct, right?

1339
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:30,493
(They will tie with Team Bo Reum if they get this right.)

1340
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:33,163
(Will it be correct?)

1341
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:34,911
(Team SEVENTEEN, incorrect.)

1342
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:36,933
- Us! - We know it!

1343
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:37,933
(It's not correct?)

1344
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:39,433
- It's not correct? - It must be "Saturday Night".

1345
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:40,933
"I thought I could have you if I acted this way."

1346
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:42,004
"Because you're mine!"

1347
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:44,004
(He's acting silly again.)

1348
00:45:44,005 --> 00:45:45,134
- We can do this. - It's number three.

1349
00:45:45,135 --> 00:45:46,174
- "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi. - Son Dam Bi.

1350
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:47,185
Say it.

1351
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:49,839
Number three, "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi.

1352
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:53,583
If Jong Kook's team gets it right, they win right away.

1353
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,813
(The others get the water bombs if they are correct.)

1354
00:45:54,814 --> 00:45:58,251
(Fate is within this question. Will Team Bo Reum get it right?)

1355
00:45:58,259 --> 00:45:59,329
"Because you're mine!"

1356
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,196
(He's acting silly again.)

1357
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,359
- We can do this. - It's number three.

1358
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,399
- "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi. - Son Dam Bi.

1359
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,410
Say it.

1360
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,064
Number three, "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi.

1361
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,808
If Jong Kook's team gets it right, they win right away.

1362
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,945
(The others get the water bombs if they are correct.)

1363
00:46:11,946 --> 00:46:13,165
(Will Team Bo Reum get it right?)

1364
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:15,634
Number three, "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi.

1365
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,849
(Bo Reum Team gets it correct.)

1366
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,249
(The number 1 song on May 13, 2009, "Saturday Night" by Son Dam Bi.)

1367
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,794
(The dance move is poking the sky with the right hand.)

1368
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,519
Let's go.

1369
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,959
Poke it! Poke it!

1370
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,040
How do I know this dance?

1371
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,287
(A perfect copy.)

1372
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:34,568
You can't do it, Hye Yoon?

1373
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:35,868
- I can do it! - She can't.

1374
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:36,980
I can!

1375
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:41,169
(A total mess)

1376
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,159
Saturday night

1377
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:44,854
- Poke it! - Nice.

1378
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,539
Saturday night

1379
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,631
(The water is full now.)

1380
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:50,692
- Yes! - We won!

1381
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,079
We won!

1382
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,171
We won!

1383
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:57,088
Excuse me. Hye Yoon knows this dance.

1384
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:58,373
(Excuse me. Hye Yoon can pull off this dance move.)

1385
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,388
- She really wants to do this. - Yes.

1386
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:02,329
- I'll do this. - She really wants to do this.

1387
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,672
Hye Yoon, you have to make up for it this time.

1388
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:05,411
Really?

1389
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,129
(I will show you.)

1390
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:09,342
- She knows it. - She's doing it.

1391
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,198
- Is it not? - It's right!

1392
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,209
Be confident.

1393
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:15,952

1394
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:17,008
(She was doing well.)

1395
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:19,138
(What is this?)

1396
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,908
(Creative dancing Round 2)

1397
00:47:20,909 --> 00:47:22,048
- What are you doing? - What was that?

1398
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:23,121
- What is that? - Hye Yoon!

1399
00:47:23,179 --> 00:47:25,199
- What was that? - What's this?

1400
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:27,079
- Hye Yoon, how could you... - What is this move?

1401
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,312
I was dancing to the beat.

1402
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,118
I think you like these kinds of moves.

1403
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,158
We can do it!

1404
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:34,088
- Seungkwan knows the dance. - He wants to do it too.

1405
00:47:34,089 --> 00:47:36,080
- Dam Bi was in the same agency. - Yes, Seungkwan.

1406
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:37,959
Boo Seungkwan!

1407
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,849
(The agency colleague will show how it's done!)

1408
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,428
(Possessed by Son Dam Bi)

1409
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:44,883
So sexy!

1410
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,590
He's good. He's full of confidence.

1411
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:49,868
He's full of confidence.

1412
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:50,939
(Proving himself Dam Bi's junior, he has good feet movements...)

1413
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,209
(and exact hand movements!)

1414
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,532
(He plays with the beat like a pro.)

1415
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:57,278
- This is how you do it. - So sexy!

1416
00:47:57,279 --> 00:47:58,532
It's perfect.

1417
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,341
(A well put ending.)

1418
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,149
- Nice. - How talented!

1419
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:07,189
- He even knows the details. - No one got that right!

1420
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,684
- That was flawless. - The winner of this mission is...

1421
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,798
- Jong Kook, Bo Reum, - What a relief.

1422
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,999
(The winner of this mission is Team Bo Reum.)

1423
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,698
It will be, "Running Man Han Bo Reum".

1424
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:16,769
(The winner of this mission is Team Bo Reum.)

1425
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,138
Also, everyone,

1426
00:48:18,139 --> 00:48:20,298
- the three teams will get bombed. - We will.

1427
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:22,138
- I will give you two questions... - Okay.

1428
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,523
- We can get this right. - to single out the last team.

1429
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,008
There are no scenes for this round.

1430
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:26,238
- Let's go! - You can come out directly...

1431
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,609
after pressing it and say the answer.

1432
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,649
Number four, "Honey" by Park Jin Young.

1433
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,678
(Thanks to Mingyu who was an emcee of Inkigayo,)

1434
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:33,778
(Team SEVENTEEN wins 2nd place!)

1435
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,669
- Good job! - Good job!

1436
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,218
- We really have to get this. - Please.

1437
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:40,118
- Let's get this one. - Please, please, please!

1438
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,928
In 2008,

1439
00:48:41,929 --> 00:48:45,028
- March 16, which song was number 1? - March. That's spring.

1440
00:48:45,029 --> 00:48:46,198
It's spring.

1441
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:47,298
During the last cold spell.

1442
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,669
Number one, "One More Time" by Jewelry.

1443
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,698
(Confused)

1444
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:51,769
I went on a talent show with this song.

1445
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:52,780
Number two,

1446
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:54,884
"Kissing You" by Girls' Generation.

1447
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,939
It's number one, "Baby one more time".

1448
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,008
- Is it? - Number one.

1449
00:48:58,009 --> 00:48:59,209
They'll get a chance if we get this wrong.

1450
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,539
- Okay. - This is crucial.

1451
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,649
- We got this. - It's really important.

1452
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,778
- I'm so nervous! - It's either one.

1453
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,618
- Please! - 1, 2, 3!

1454
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:07,379
- Number one, Jewelry's... - Number one, Jewelry's...

1455
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,349
- "One More Time". - "Baby One More Time".

1456
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,965
- "One More Time". - "One More Time"?

1457
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:12,859
- Say it again? - "One More Time"?

1458
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,359
- "Baby One More Time". - No, it's "One More Time".

1459
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,629
- It's "Baby One More Time"! - Just stay quiet.

1460
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:16,859
It's "One More Time"!

1461
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,283
(Don't say anything and just stay quiet!)

1462
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:21,428
"Baby" is just part of the lyrics!

1463
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:22,798
It's "Baby One More Time". Is it "One More Time"?

1464
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:24,229
- It's "Baby One More Time". - "Baby One More Time"?

1465
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,298
- "Baby One More Time"? - Okay.

1466
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,368
- Okay. - The answer is?

1467
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:28,968
- "Baby One More Time" by Jewelry. - "Baby One More Time" by Jewelry.

1468
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,323
(Team EXID chooses "Baby One More Time" by Jewelry.)

1469
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:34,242
(If they get it right, Team Hye Yoon will get the water bomb.)

1470
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,548
(Will Team EXID get it correct?)

1471
00:49:37,549 --> 00:49:40,519
(Incorrect)

1472
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,689
Let me answer!

1473
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,888
(Now Team Hye Yoon has the chance.)

1474
00:49:42,889 --> 00:49:45,359
(I'm not sure about the title though.)

1475
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,258
"Baby one more time" is the lyrics.

1476
00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:48,441
It's just "One More Time".

1477
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,104
- Is it? - Seok Jin was right.

1478
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:51,859
- Let me answer. - Number one.

1479
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,729
- "One More Time" by Jewelry. - "One More Time" by Jewelry.

1480
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,928
(Team Hye Yoon goes with "One More Time" by Jewelry.)

1481
00:49:54,929 --> 00:49:58,878
(If they get it right, the water bomb goes to Team EXID!)

1482
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,638
- Correct! - Okay!

1483
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,680
(Team Hye Yoon gets it correct.)

1484
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,463
Why didn't they believe Seok Jin?

1485
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,678
- Why, you! - It's okay.

1486
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:08,709
(I'm doomed.)

1487
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,649
- No way. - I told you it was "One More Time"!

1488
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,660
(I should have listened to him.)

1489
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,330
It's this part, now.

1490
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,409
- It's coming! - Should we join in?

1491
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,818
Kim Hye Yoon!

1492
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:19,214
(It's different this time!)

1493
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:22,129
(She shows off her perfect dance.)

1494
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:23,645
- Oh, no. - It's perfect!

1495
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,146
She knows this one.

1496
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:27,440
She knows this one.

1497
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,899
- You're right! - Am I?

1498
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,415
- You're right! - She knows this one.

1499
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,860
- You're right. - I danced to this at a talent show!

1500
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,209
Okay!

1501
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,568
Great job, Hye Yoon!

1502
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,138
(Thank goodness, we're saved.)

1503
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,138
Okay.

1504
00:50:40,139 --> 00:50:41,849
Why can't you be more assertive?

1505
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:43,609
- I kept telling you! - You should have...

1506
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,499
(Seok Jin's anger bursts out.)

1507
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:46,979
- said it more definitely! - Hey!

1508
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:49,318
- Baby one more time - One more time

1509
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:51,088
- She's good at it. - You're good at this one.

1510
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,088
No, it's all right.

1511
00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:53,919
You're good at everything except for "Ddudu Ddudu".

1512
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,374
I learned this dance.

1513
00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:57,646
For your information, on the top of the monitor,

1514
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,359
"Search Running Man, Han Bo Reum" will be displayed starting now.

1515
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,428
- It's up now. - Where?

1516
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:02,428
- Where will it say that? - It will be on the right.

1517
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:03,540
- On the right? - Yes.

1518
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,099
- Everyone, from now on... - Please.

1519
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,939
- Search. - Running Man.

1520
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,039
And EXID!

1521
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,439
(Please search Running Man, EXID!)

1522
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,500
(Splash)

1523
00:51:15,279 --> 00:51:18,248
(Please search Running Man, EXID.)

1524
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,240
(That was close.)

1525
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:23,088
(Awestruck)

1526
00:51:23,089 --> 00:51:24,349
- Now, - Wow.

1527
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:25,959
- we will move on to the next round. - Wow.

1528
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,636
(Let's move on to top the real-time trending topic chart!)

1529
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,099
Everyone,

1530
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,928
this is the final round.

1531
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:33,849
- Really? - Yes.

1532
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,169
Is it the final round already?

1533
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:36,999
From now on, each team...

1534
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,368
will be making a one-minute promotional video.

1535
00:51:40,369 --> 00:51:42,408
- A promotional video? - One minute?

1536
00:51:42,409 --> 00:51:45,066
And you will upload it on social media.

1537
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:47,439
Whoever gets the most number of likes...

1538
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,048
will be today's winner.

1539
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:50,979
(The team who gets the most number of likes will win.)

1540
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:51,979
That's...

1541
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,178
This will be hard. It's hard to make it a minute long.

1542
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,806
I never even thought about it.

1543
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:57,818
Well, Hye Yoon...

1544
00:51:57,819 --> 00:51:59,738
- was on the dance team. - It's true.

1545
00:51:59,889 --> 00:52:01,859
- For real. - She's a dance machine.

1546
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,428
Her lullaby dance.

1547
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:05,229
It's 2 o'clock right now.

1548
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,329
We will gather again after 30 minutes.

1549
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,528
- All right. - But if Solji...

1550
00:52:08,529 --> 00:52:10,419
- hits the high notes... - Are we going now?

1551
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,039
My goodness, this is hard.

1552
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,269
What should we do?

1553
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:16,338
Hye Yoon, which song can you dance to the best?

1554
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:18,068
- The best? - Yes.

1555
00:52:18,069 --> 00:52:20,109
Something you learned or you're confident about.

1556
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,908
(Any new choreography you learned on your dance team...)

1557
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:22,908
"Tell Me"?

1558
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,697
("Tell Me" by the Wonder Girls?)

1559
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,118
(That was released 12 years ago.)

1560
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,948
Didn't they disband a long time ago?

1561
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:31,838
That's more than ten years old.

1562
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:33,658
(If you want a recent song...)

1563
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:34,718
"Bboom Bboom"?

1564
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,059
("Bboom Bboom" by MOMOLAND?)

1565
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,329
- You can do that? - Yes.

1566
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:38,976
(Giddy-up, giddy-up)

1567
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,629
Yes, I think I can.

1568
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,741
That gesture now...

1569
00:52:41,969 --> 00:52:43,788
- Isn't it too... - Isn't that from "Gangnam Style"?

1570
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,698
- Hye Yoon, if you don't know, - This is "Gangnam Style".

1571
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:47,487
- please just say so! - Isn't that it?

1572
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,725
Oh, this one.

1573
00:52:49,909 --> 00:52:51,757
Shall we see it, then?

1574
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,138
It was...

1575
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,372
(The maverick among dancers, what will her dance look like?)

1576
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:59,182
(This is what it looks like.)

1577
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,519
Since she was on the dance team.

1578
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,649
- That's right. - Yes.

1579
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,048
I was on the dance team.

1580
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:05,231
(Fully concentrating)

1581
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:07,430
Here I go.

1582
00:53:08,259 --> 00:53:09,341
See?

1583
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:10,741
Here I go.

1584
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:12,873
See?

1585
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:15,669
(Something doesn’t look right.)

1586
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,680
Isn't this right?

1587
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,599
I don't think your hands are supposed to be...

1588
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,559
(What's wrong with your hands?)

1589
00:53:21,299 --> 00:53:22,380
Hye Yoon.

1590
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:23,982
It's not this.

1591
00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,278
- What was it? - Isn't it this?

1592
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:28,278
(You're supposed to put the fingers slightly apart.)

1593
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,461
Is it this?

1594
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:32,038
(Sigh)

1595
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,479
It's okay.

1596
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,888
- Hey. - Why are you sighing?

1597
00:53:35,889 --> 00:53:36,899
(Does she really not know why?)

1598
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:40,222
We're supposed to make her an A-list celebrity today!

1599
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,915
We're like her agents right now.

1600
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,599
- We have to make her popular. - Now I know how agents would feel.

1601
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,658
(Now they know what it's like to be celebrities' agents.)

1602
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:47,658
- Listen to me. - How was my dance moves?

1603
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,690
When she did this, my heart was broken.

1604
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:51,689
I had no idea how I could make it right..

1605
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,638
(After watching the wrong hand motions she learned...)

1606
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,109
(from her dance team,)

1607
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,674
(Manager Lee, "What am I supposed to do with her?")

1608
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,557
It doesn't have to be the latest songs.

1609
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:01,821
How about BTS?

1610
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,749
- That would be... - BTS?

1611
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,809
(A boy group's choreography would be hard for her.)

1612
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,334
"Fire" is actually...

1613
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,118
Kwang Soo can pull off "Fire".

1614
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,706
- Really? - Yes, I like it.

1615
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:11,436
Do you want to show us here?

1616
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:13,088
Go, Kwang Soo.

1617
00:54:13,089 --> 00:54:14,088
(Manager Lee is the only hope to save them from the crisis.)

1618
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:15,359
- Show us, Kwang Soo. - It's not difficult.

1619
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,388
- Show us. - It's not hard.

1620
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:18,088
He's really good at it.

1621
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,311
(I'll watch carefully and learn.)

1622
00:54:22,869 --> 00:54:24,961
(Flap flap)

1623
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,638
(Fans of BTS will be shocked...)

1624
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,014
(if they watch Manager Lee's creative dance moves.)

1625
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:31,463
(Culture shock)

1626
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,008
(Hye Yoon...)

1627
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:35,131
(This is how you should dance!)

1628
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,360
He's still good at it.

1629
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:38,109
(Running Man doesn't agree with his reinterpretation.)

1630
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,867
- He's good... - Kwang Soo, you did well.

1631
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,178
Kwang Soo, you did well.

1632
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,888
What do you think, Hye Yoon?

1633
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:44,318
- That was "Fire". - See?

1634
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,704
Look how good he is.

1635
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,859
He pulled it off.

1636
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,928
Right?

1637
00:54:48,929 --> 00:54:50,189
You should do something...

1638
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:52,258
that you can enjoy yourself with.

1639
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:54,229
Like Jae Seok said, it should be short.

1640
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,269
It doesn't have to be sophisticated.

1641
00:54:56,270 --> 00:54:58,491
How about "I'm a shining solo"?

1642
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,798
"Solo"?

1643
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:00,999
(She can dance "Solo" by Jennie?)

1644
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,238
This is good.

1645
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:04,390
- This is quite recent, isn't it? - Yes.

1646
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,929
I'll try the chorus part.

1647
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,064
- It's coming. - Get ready.

1648
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:12,979
(What?)

1649
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,379
(She's... She's good!)

1650
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,388
Oh, great!

1651
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,388
(Jae Seok is now satisfied.)

1652
00:55:16,389 --> 00:55:17,833
That's all I know.

1653
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,388
(Just 2 seconds)

1654
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:21,519
And this.

1655
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,588
(That's all I know.)

1656
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:23,771
Hey. Wait.

1657
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,729
- This is all I know. - I'm sorry, Hye Yoon, but...

1658
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,750
(How can we get likes with only this?)

1659
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:31,080
How can we...

1660
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:33,815
(Their future looks bleak.)

1661
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,769
Why don't we go with "HeungBo" by Yukgaksu?

1662
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:37,224
(I'd rather go with "HeungBo" by Yukgaksu.)

1663
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:39,778
"HeungBo" by Yukgaksu?

1664
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:41,396
(Jae Seok is tempted.)

1665
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,548
HeungBo is unbelievable

1666
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,559
Isn't that how it goes?

1667
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,749
(Hye Yoon is unbelievable.)

1668
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,419
(They are trying to cover Hye Yoon's lame dance skills...)

1669
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:51,065
(by changing the song lyrics.)

1670
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,011
And then, Hye Yoon goes...

1671
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:56,048
Shall we add one line from "Sky Castle"?

1672
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:58,289
- For the finale. How's that? - Yes, for the finale.

1673
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,658
- Yes. - You can end it.

1674
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:00,658
- I can do it. - Which line?

1675
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,368
Is there a line you can still remember?

1676
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:05,899
(Then is there a famous line you can still remember?)

1677
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,999
"Do you want to die?"

1678
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,352
(All of a sudden)

1679
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:12,053
I'm offended.

1680
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,678
- That's not important right now. - Okay.

1681
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,309
- Okay, okay. - It's not for us to feel good.

1682
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,825
What are you talking about?

1683
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,318
I have a dancer's genes.

1684
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:21,834
Bring Ms. Kim Joo Young.

1685
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,141
Bring Ms. Kim Joo Young now!

1686
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,432
Okay, good.

1687
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,919
- That was short. - And that has an impact.

1688
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,000
It's just right.

1689
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:30,229
(Team EXID starts a meeting.)

1690
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,559
- Haha makes really good videos. - No...

1691
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,428
- It's nothing. - He's really good at it.

1692
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:35,468
- Should we begin with singing? - Singing?

1693
00:56:35,469 --> 00:56:36,928
They both sing really well, you know.

1694
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:37,999
They are such great singers.

1695
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,338
Hani is the queen of fancam.

1696
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:40,838
I think...

1697
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:42,008
(Seeing Hani, Haha comes up with an idea.)

1698
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:43,989
At first, people will think it's the same old thing.

1699
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,039
"They're dancing and doing the same stuff".

1700
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,959
- It's the same dances... - Just then!

1701
00:56:48,339 --> 00:56:51,149
It will turn out to be something totally unexpected.

1702
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,372
- While they are dancing? - While they're dancing,

1703
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,940
Solji will sing like this...

1704
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:58,118
and Hani will dance.

1705
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:00,118
I'll go around, shooting, and you keep dancing like crazy.

1706
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,150
I'll shoot from your head to toe, like this.

1707
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,915
- Up and down, everywhere. - All around.

1708
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,074
You keep doing that, and then...

1709
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:08,915
I'll go all the way, like this.

1710
00:57:10,299 --> 00:57:12,439
(But...)

1711
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,288
Then, he'll start drooling.

1712
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:16,008
Take a look.

1713
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:17,788
(How will Director Ha's unpredictable creation turn out?)

1714
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:21,168
(EXID's performance catches the eye...)

1715
00:57:21,639 --> 00:57:23,579
(But...)

1716
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,943
(What?)

1717
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,818
(Seok Jin's cameraman Yoo Seok is smiling.)

1718
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:31,941
- If he drools... - This is funny.

1719
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,559
- This is funny. - This is hilarious.

1720
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,658
It was very natural.

1721
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,928
(He gets caught while shooting someone else, instead of Seok Jin.)

1722
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,729
This is really funny.

1723
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,359
I have a suggestion, Yoo Seok.

1724
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,430
- You don't need to act. - Can you spit out water?

1725
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,399
Do this.

1726
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,480
All suggestions are nice.

1727
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,109
This is really funny.

1728
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:50,769
- Let's go with this one. - Yes.

1729
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,294
Let's go with this one.

1730
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,395
I will teach you slowly.

1731
00:57:54,509 --> 00:57:56,579
With this foot, put your weight on the ball.

1732
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:58,379
With this foot, put your weight on the heel.

1733
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,019
- 1. - 1.

1734
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,413
One. Do the same with the other foot.

1735
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:03,789
Okay.

1736
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,488
1, 2.

1737
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,782
Ji Hyo can do it. So many people can't.

1738
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:11,088
I can't do the steps as well as I would like.

1739
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:12,559
You need to practice.

1740
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,821
Rub your feet, So Min.

1741
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:17,144
Keep your feet straight at first.

1742
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:19,198
(Rub my feet? Like this?)

1743
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:20,198
Keep your feet straight.

1744
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,309
- Is this what you are doing? - That's right.

1745
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:24,109
- Is this what you are doing? - That's right.

1746
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,579
(The old steps jump out.)

1747
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,004
Ji Hyo, techno was in vogue back in my days.

1748
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:29,548
Do you know what techno is?

1749
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:30,690
No.

1750
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:33,295
It was in vogue back in my days.

1751
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,988
This is my first time to feel such an apparent generation gap.

1752
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:39,488
This is my first time to feel it on Running Man.

1753
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:40,803
Seriously.

1754
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,018
It won't be funny to see...

1755
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,928
all four of us dance as soon as the video starts.

1756
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:48,568
Shall we dance one by one?

1757
00:58:48,569 --> 00:58:51,028
Each of us should come from a different place.

1758
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:53,939
- I could sit down. - That's right.

1759
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:54,939
I could sit down.

1760
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,627
Let's say I saw you dance while I was passing by.

1761
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,695
- I will dance first. - Go ahead.

1762
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,178
- Oh Nanana - What?

1763
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:03,230
What is going on?

1764
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,919
("Oh Nanana" party suddenly begins.)

1765
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,178
We can do the Oh Nanana Dance together.

1766
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:08,888
- It's a good idea. - After that...

1767
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:10,566
I want to provoke you.

1768
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,488
- What do you mean? - I want to pass by you...

1769
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:13,758
- and hit you. - I see.

1770
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,245
I want to pass by you.

1771
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,171
For goodness' sake.

1772
00:59:17,589 --> 00:59:18,758
(Do you want to die?)

1773
00:59:18,759 --> 00:59:19,769
(Creaking)

1774
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,729
(She attacks his eyes with her lousy dance.)

1775
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,028
That came out of nowhere.

1776
00:59:24,029 --> 00:59:27,302
- That came out of nowhere. - It's like "Swallowtail Butterfly".

1777
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,934
She moved like this.

1778
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,422
She moved like this.

1779
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:36,178
We should have a video call with famous celebrities.

1780
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,849
(Team Bo Reum's content is a video call with celebrities.)

1781
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,849
(That sounds fun.)

1782
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,019
What do you think?

1783
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,379
It's a good idea.

1784
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,388
- Right? - Yes, it's a good idea.

1785
00:59:42,389 --> 00:59:45,076
We can show the celebrities' names first.

1786
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:47,459
- Let's pick a few celebrities. - That's right.

1787
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,652
There is Song Joong Ki.

1788
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,323
- That's good. - There is also Park Seo Jun.

1789
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,215
Seo Jun is quite popular.

1790
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,287
EXO members.

1791
00:59:56,869 --> 00:59:58,099
If they answer the call,

1792
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,039
it will be quite now.

1793
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,594
- I will call, so start filming. - We will start filming.

1794
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:03,781
I will do the filming.

1795
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:06,026
All right. Here I go.

1796
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,256
I have high hopes for him this year.

1797
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:11,377
(Who is Jong Kook calling first?)

1798
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:12,662
All right. Who are you calling?

1799
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:15,818
(Jackson of GOT7)

1800
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:18,920
(Will Jackson answer when he is busy with schedules?)

1801
01:00:19,259 --> 01:00:20,258
Ayo, Jackson!

1802
01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:21,269
(Jackson answers the phone.)

1803
01:00:21,929 --> 01:00:24,859
(Jackson, hello.)

1804
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,829
Jackson!

1805
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,868
I can definitely call Ryu Hyun Jin.

1806
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:29,879
(Is he calling Ryu Hyun Jin this time?)

1807
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:32,752
Hyun Jin.

1808
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:35,198
- Where are you? - I am at a shoot for Running Man.

1809
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,563
- Hello. - I am at a shoot for Running Man.

1810
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,254
Shall I try calling Son Heung Min?

1811
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,178
- Jong Kook. - That's incredible.

1812
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,249
(Jong Kook catches up with his close friends.)

1813
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,148
Here we go. The studio is in a frenzy.

1814
01:00:46,279 --> 01:00:49,988
At 2:30pm, what is your star doing?

1815
01:00:49,989 --> 01:00:51,605
You are curious about what comes afterward, right?

1816
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,818
If we place first in terms of the number of likes,

1817
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,677
we will reveal the full video.

1818
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,582
- Please press like. - Press it!

1819
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,872
There is more!

1820
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:04,028
(In 30 minutes, produce a video that gets likes from the netizens.)

1821
01:01:04,029 --> 01:01:05,868
- We should stop here. - That's right.

1822
01:01:05,869 --> 01:01:07,415
(Only the team with the most likes gets to reveal the full video.)

1823
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,039
Let's go!

1824
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,626
(Which team's video will get the most number of likes?)

1825
01:01:10,969 --> 01:01:14,373
(Time is up!)

1826
01:01:15,009 --> 01:01:18,249
Now, we will upload the four videos...

1827
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:22,019
on Running Man's official social media at the same time.

1828
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:23,289
(Running Man with EXID, SEVENTEEN, Kim Hye Yoon, and Han Bo Reum)

1829
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:27,019
We will check the number of likes in real time.

1830
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,988
Now, we will give you the rules for the final race.

1831
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:31,039
Okay.

1832
01:01:31,089 --> 01:01:33,658
It's Tail Catching Race.

1833
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:34,658
(Tail Catching Race)

1834
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,992
- This is important. - The videos have been uploaded...

1835
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:39,319
and people are pressing likes.

1836
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:41,298
(However)

1837
01:01:41,299 --> 01:01:44,138
In the order the teams get eliminated,

1838
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,709
the videos will be deleted.

1839
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,079
(The teams that are out will get their videos deleted.)

1840
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,178
What?

1841
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:50,609
The video needs to remain uploaded to receive more likes.

1842
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,379
That's right. That's right.

1843
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,520
The team that has the most number of likes wins...

1844
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:56,849
after the race.

1845
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:58,388
That team will receive a big benefit.

1846
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:00,019
What could it be?

1847
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,729
Even if you survive until the end, you don't win...

1848
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,789
if your team's number of likes is less than the other team.

1849
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:06,099
Then the other team wins, right?

1850
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:07,899
- That's right. - Really?

1851
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:11,798
Each team needs to decide who will be the Tail.

1852
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:15,778
Once the Tail's balloon pops, everyone on the team is out.

1853
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,283
- My goodness. - Really?

1854
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,923
This is the Tail Catching Race, so Team 1 will attack Team 2.

1855
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,333
Team 2 will attack Team 3.

1856
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:27,278
Team 3 will attack Team 4.

1857
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:29,718
Team 4 will attack Team 1.

1858
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:31,538
We can't pop all the balloons.

1859
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:34,258
- You can go. - It will be fun.

1860
01:02:34,259 --> 01:02:35,573
(Which team will hold out and get the most number of likes?)

1861
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:38,745
In my opinion,

1862
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,758
this race is all about popping the target team's balloon.

1863
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:44,899
Right? We need to figure out our target team...

1864
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,138
and the team that targets us.

1865
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,399
- That's right. - That's right.

1866
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,419
(It's important to figure out the team that targets your team.)

1867
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:53,039
Please reveal the team number.

1868
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,749
Okay. We are number four.

1869
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,002
(Team Hye Yoon's number is 4.)

1870
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:02,059
Team Hye Yoon's target is the team whose number is one,

1871
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:05,417
Team EXID.

1872
01:03:05,489 --> 01:03:09,227
(Seok Jin and Haha are easy targets.)

1873
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:12,399
(Meanwhile, the easy Team EXID)

1874
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,237
- Our number is 1. - Team EXID's number is 1.

1875
01:03:16,529 --> 01:03:17,629
Your target is...

1876
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:20,568
the team whose number is two is Team SEVENTEEN.

1877
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:22,055
It's doable.

1878
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:24,324
- Our number is 2. - 2.

1879
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,374
Your target is the team whose number is three...

1880
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,349
is Team Bo Reum.

1881
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:31,349
What should we do?

1882
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,749
(Team Bo Reum Feat. Jong Kook)

1883
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,849
(This is a disaster.)

1884
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,588
How are we supposed to pop their balloon?

1885
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:38,019
We should be thankful that we aren't Jong Kook's target.

1886
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,818
- You are right. - This is better.

1887
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:42,283
Your target is the team whose number is four...

1888
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,503
is Team Hye Yoon.

1889
01:03:44,889 --> 01:03:47,028
- This is great. - Thank goodness.

1890
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:48,575
- It'll be easy. - I'm glad to hear that.

1891
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,829
(The target teams have been announced.)

1892
01:03:50,830 --> 01:03:53,599
Now, please choose a member...

1893
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,399
who will be the Tail.

1894
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,868
- You should be it. - You are the best choice, Haha.

1895
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,269
- Haha. - I think...

1896
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,908
it should be Hani or Solji.

1897
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:01,627
Solji is strong.

1898
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,479
How about Solji? It's your first time on Running Man,

1899
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,749
- so you should try it. - Give it a try.

1900
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,079
- That's right. - Give it a try.

1901
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,888
This puts me under a lot of pressure.

1902
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:10,019
No, no. Give it a try.

1903
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,289
We just need to pop the balloon of Jong Kook's team.

1904
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:13,388
(Team SEVENTEEN needs to get Team Bo Reum.)

1905
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:14,959
- What should we do? - The Tail should be...

1906
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,729
Seungkwan or you.

1907
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:18,559
Then I will be the Tail.

1908
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,928
- Okay. - If you can't defend me...

1909
01:04:20,929 --> 01:04:22,399
against the other team,

1910
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,198
- I will run away. - Okay.

1911
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:26,499
We should attack.

1912
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,838
Hye Yoon, take this balloon and hide somewhere.

1913
01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:29,849
Okay.

1914
01:04:30,509 --> 01:04:31,508
- Okay? - Okay.

1915
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:32,738
- You are fast, right? - Yes.

1916
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:35,879
Jong Kook and I will protect you.

1917
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,709
I don't know which team will come after us.

1918
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,818
- The race will start in 10 seconds. - Okay.

1919
01:04:40,819 --> 01:04:42,588
Hye Yoon, hide well.

1920
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:44,749
Okay.

1921
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,437
- Make sure you come back. - We will search fast.

1922
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:48,588
That's good. That's the attitude.

1923
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:51,388
Look for places people can hide.

1924
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,859
- Very nice! - Very nice! Let's go!

1925
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,375
The race starts.

1926
01:04:55,869 --> 01:04:57,698
Don't be nervous.

1927
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,899
What color of clothes was Jong Kook's team wearing?

1928
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:01,039
Black.

1929
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,468
It was black.

1930
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:05,709
(They don't know which team is targeting them.)

1931
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,599
- There they are. - Which team is it?

1932
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:08,678
There.

1933
01:05:08,679 --> 01:05:09,689
(They spot Team SEVENTEEN.)

1934
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,278
There they are.

1935
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:13,678
- Team Bo Reum. - Where?

1936
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:15,618
- There they are. - They are our target.

1937
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,189
- My goodness. - Let's see...

1938
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,493
how they react upon seeing us. They are talking among themselves.

1939
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,988
Don't make it obvious.

1940
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:24,359
Approach them naturally.

1941
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,559
Then we can pop their balloon right away.

1942
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,993
- They are coming this way. - Will they come to us?

1943
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,129
What?

1944
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,391
They saw us watching them.

1945
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,429
Are you going to come after us?

1946
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:39,203
I don't know. I will give it some thoughts.

1947
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,198
Why don't we share information?

1948
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,278
Why would you do that for Tail Catching Race?

1949
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,936
Let's be allies.

1950
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,035
What's your number?

1951
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:51,388
Our target team...

1952
01:05:51,389 --> 01:05:52,875
isn't you.

1953
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:55,488
Then why are you approaching us so confidently?

1954
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:56,758
You could be our target.

1955
01:05:56,759 --> 01:05:58,488
(You could be our target.)

1956
01:05:58,489 --> 01:06:00,599
Let's say our number is 3. No, 4.

1957
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,099
No, number one.

1958
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,130
You could be our target. Why are you approaching us?

1959
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:08,269
We have no reason to pop your balloon.

1960
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:10,868
How would we pop your balloon?

1961
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:12,424
- It's now pretty close. - They are coming.

1962
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:14,309
- I think we are their target. - You are right.

1963
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,709
I think it's them. I think we're their target.

1964
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,479
- Go up. - I think it's them.

1965
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,919
(Our plan has failed.)

1966
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,314
If we hold out, the number of likes will go up.

1967
01:06:22,389 --> 01:06:24,168
- Firstly... - We need to eliminate them.

1968
01:06:25,489 --> 01:06:27,258
There is nowhere to hide!

1969
01:06:27,259 --> 01:06:28,704
(Hye Yoon is looking for a place to hide.)

1970
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:31,088
(Jae Seok and Kwang Soo are looking for Team EXID.)

1971
01:06:31,089 --> 01:06:32,359
What's your number?

1972
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,399
(What's your number?)

1973
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:36,328
(They find their target, Team EXID.)

1974
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,417
(Kwang Soo lies.)

1975
01:06:39,569 --> 01:06:41,761
- 1. - Is your number 1?

1976
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:44,769
- He is lying through his teeth. - Seriously.

1977
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:45,920
What's your number?

1978
01:06:46,009 --> 01:06:47,138
Give me your number first.

1979
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:48,778
- We are 1. - We are 3.

1980
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:50,466
(They throw out numbers.)

1981
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,892
Where is Jae Seok going?

1982
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,161
Hold on.

1983
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:54,849
(While Kwang Soo buys time...)

1984
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,888
What is he doing?

1985
01:06:55,889 --> 01:06:56,888
(Jae Seok approaches carefully.)

1986
01:06:56,889 --> 01:06:58,388
Which team is your target?

1987
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,732
Why are you coming?

1988
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:01,030
You...

1989
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:02,859
You aren't our target.

1990
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,375
Then why are you coming so close?

1991
01:07:04,459 --> 01:07:06,628
- Come here. - Something doesn't seem right.

1992
01:07:06,629 --> 01:07:08,447
I think it's them.

1993
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:11,344
Don't be like that.

1994
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,739
Run away. Run away!

1995
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,809
- No, our target isn't Solji. - Don't be like that.

1996
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,208
- Our target isn't Solji. - Don't be like that.

1997
01:07:18,209 --> 01:07:19,638
- Our target isn't Solji. - Don't be like that.

1998
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:22,309
Solji, I will protect you.

1999
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:24,078
I am scared.

2000
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:25,878
- Come with us. - Okay.

2001
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:26,918
Come with us.

2002
01:07:26,919 --> 01:07:28,667
Right now, go get them.

2003
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:29,989
What?

2004
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:31,519
(Jae Seok goes after Solji, but Haha stops Jae Seok.)

2005
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,588
Solji.

2006
01:07:32,589 --> 01:07:33,599
(Haha stops Jae Seok.)

2007
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:35,758
Hani.

2008
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:37,709
(They could pop the balloon if they can't be blocked.)

2009
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,918
- Run away! - Run away.

2010
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:42,059
(Jae Seok thrusts Haha and chases after them.)

2011
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:43,180
- No. - No.

2012
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,762
(Let's run away.)

2013
01:07:47,139 --> 01:07:48,798
(Jae Seok chases right after them.)

2014
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,051
Jae Seok.

2015
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,538
Jae Seok!

2016
01:07:51,539 --> 01:07:53,008
(The video is deleted when the balloon pops.)

2017
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:54,578
- No! - No.

2018
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:56,671
(Hang in there, Solji.)

2019
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,499
(Popping)

2020
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:02,041
- It popped. - It popped.

2021
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:05,716
(However, the balloon is safe.)

2022
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,771
It popped.

2023
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,529
Isn't it too early?

2024
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:10,729
(If Solji's balloon didn't pop,)

2025
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,928
(then whose balloon popped?)

2026
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:13,969
Whose balloon was it?

2027
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,328
(While Jae Seok chases after Solji,)

2028
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:18,029
(Hye Yoon is being chased by someone.)

2029
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,168
What is it?

2030
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:21,168
- Are you still alive? - Wait, wait.

2031
01:08:21,169 --> 01:08:22,684
(Jong Kook and Se Chan are right after her.)

2032
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:24,787
- Wait a minute. - Come on.

2033
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:27,504
(Popping)

2034
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:31,584
(Team Hye Yoon's balloon is eliminated.)

2035
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:33,418
Where is everyone?

2036
01:08:33,419 --> 01:08:34,779
- I don't know. - Where are they?

2037
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,910
Hye Yoon, your team is eliminated.

2038
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:42,859
(Team Hye Yoon's video is deleted.)

2039
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:44,128
(Running Man EXID, Running Man SEVENTEEN)

2040
01:08:44,129 --> 01:08:45,846
We could have gone together.

2041
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,572
We made a mistake.

2042
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:49,345
- I even got on my knees. - You're impressive.

2043
01:08:49,629 --> 01:08:50,679
No, I'm not.

2044
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,688
(I'm so relieved.)

2045
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,355
- That was amazing. - Who is left?

2046
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:56,585
It must be them.

2047
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,952
Jong Kook must be after us.

2048
01:08:58,539 --> 01:09:00,939
It's Jong Kook. We're in trouble.

2049
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:03,479
We need Team EXID to eliminate Team SEVENTEEN.

2050
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,878
(They recognize which team will attack them.)

2051
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,248
- That's the best. - Right.

2052
01:09:06,249 --> 01:09:08,846
- We should go after Haha. - Yes.

2053
01:09:09,249 --> 01:09:10,819
They're here, Jong Kook.

2054
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,159
- Are they here? - Ji Hyo is here.

2055
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,659
(Team SEVENTEEN appears.)

2056
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,972
Hurry up. Run.

2057
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:18,388
Go downstairs. I'll block them.

2058
01:09:18,389 --> 01:09:19,729
- They're going downstairs. - They're going downstairs.

2059
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,599
Let's go down this way.

2060
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,782
- What do we do? - Wait.

2061
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,369
Look that way. I'll look here.

2062
01:09:24,370 --> 01:09:25,642
(They block the top and the bottom.)

2063
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:29,668
(Team SEVENTEEN carefully approaches the place where Se Chan is.)

2064
01:09:29,669 --> 01:09:30,668
(They spot Se Chan.)

2065
01:09:30,669 --> 01:09:31,781
Hello.

2066
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,291
- Hello. - Let's go downstairs.

2067
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:34,926
Hide. Go downstairs.

2068
01:09:35,139 --> 01:09:36,625
Hurry and run away.

2069
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,020
Go downstairs.

2070
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,378
Go, I'll block the way.

2071
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:40,479
(Team SEVENTEEN chase after them.)

2072
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:41,691
Run away.

2073
01:09:42,049 --> 01:09:43,149
Run farther away.

2074
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,588
(Team Bo Reum runs away.)

2075
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:47,088
(Seungkwan is chasing right after Team Bo Reum.)

2076
01:09:47,089 --> 01:09:48,418
Go, Bo Reum. That's right.

2077
01:09:48,419 --> 01:09:49,758
(First obstacle is Se Chan.)

2078
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:52,355
(Seungkwan passes him easily with speed.)

2079
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:53,641
What do I do with him?

2080
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,758
What do I do with him?

2081
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,069
(Second obstacle is Jong Kook.)

2082
01:09:57,070 --> 01:09:58,483
What do I do?

2083
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,099
- I won't go. - Seungkwan.

2084
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:02,888
I won't go.

2085
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,858
This is what his strength feels like.

2086
01:10:05,209 --> 01:10:06,739
Seungkwan.

2087
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,224
- I won't do it. - Wait.

2088
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,878
I should keep you on hold.

2089
01:10:09,879 --> 01:10:12,232
- I'll keep you with me. - No.

2090
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,347
(Se Chan and Bo Reum run away safely.)

2091
01:10:15,749 --> 01:10:18,449
(Ji Hyo was after them on a different route.)

2092
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:19,819
Go upstairs.

2093
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,638
(She spots Bo Reum.)

2094
01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:23,128
Go upstairs.

2095
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:24,402
(This is her chance.)

2096
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:25,928
Go upstairs.

2097
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:27,848
(Mingyu and Ji Hyo versus Se Chan and Bo Reum.)

2098
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,328
What's going on?

2099
01:10:29,329 --> 01:10:30,428
(Just then)

2100
01:10:30,429 --> 01:10:31,668
(She spots Seok Jin.)

2101
01:10:31,669 --> 01:10:32,851
Be careful.

2102
01:10:33,139 --> 01:10:34,887
Ji Hyo.

2103
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,508
Ji Hyo!

2104
01:10:36,509 --> 01:10:39,138
(They run after Ji Hyo.)

2105
01:10:39,139 --> 01:10:40,838
Ji Hyo, Ji Hyo.

2106
01:10:40,839 --> 01:10:43,707
(They're face to face.)

2107
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:47,409
(Will she protect it, or will he pop it?)

2108
01:10:49,419 --> 01:10:51,975
(Mingyu lifts him up.)

2109
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,328
(Is this his respect for an old man?)

2110
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,814
- I was so surprised. - What's going on?

2111
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:01,199
Seok Jin was moving unhurriedly.

2112
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,643
(Ji Hyo is now safe thanks to polite Mingyu.)

2113
01:11:03,129 --> 01:11:05,369
(Seok Jin tries to chase after her.)

2114
01:11:05,370 --> 01:11:06,569
What do I do?

2115
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,418
(He's exhausted.)

2116
01:11:08,469 --> 01:11:09,668
Close the door, Mingyu.

2117
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:10,968
(Open the door.)

2118
01:11:10,969 --> 01:11:12,050
My goodness.

2119
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:17,178
(Ji Hyo barely escaped.)

2120
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:18,260
You startled me.

2121
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,560
They're coming up.

2122
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:21,178
- Let's move upwards. - Wait.

2123
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:22,178
Let's move, Bo Reum.

2124
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:24,744
(They're on a strong defense.)

2125
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:25,899
Go upstairs first.

2126
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,859
(Bo Reum flees to the top.)

2127
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,659
There she is. It's Ji Hyo.

2128
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,328
(Haha is chasing after Ji Hyo.)

2129
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,128
(He finds Ji Hyo on the first floor.)

2130
01:11:34,129 --> 01:11:36,018
- I'm scared so I can't even flee... - Come here.

2131
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:37,510
- I... - Come here.

2132
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,963
- I should hide. - You should.

2133
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:41,638
Let's hurry.

2134
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:43,569
(Haha approaches them furtively.)

2135
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,338
- Who is it? - It's Haha.

2136
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:47,733
Hurry and run away.

2137
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,078
Everyone is here.

2138
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:51,120
(It's a head-to-head fight.)

2139
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:52,849
(Seok Jin also joins.)

2140
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,173
Be careful of Team EXID.

2141
01:11:55,419 --> 01:11:57,369
They split into two groups.

2142
01:11:58,820 --> 01:11:59,888
He's running.

2143
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:00,918
Haha is running.

2144
01:12:00,919 --> 01:12:04,566
(He's been waiting for his chance, Haha starts to run.)

2145
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,899
Should we go this way?

2146
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:09,515
(They flee to the mountain to avoid Haha.)

2147
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:10,680
Go.

2148
01:12:10,999 --> 01:12:12,099
Wait a minute.

2149
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,756
Let's take a look first.

2150
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:14,981
Stay still.

2151
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,109
Ji Hyo, here.

2152
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,409
(Haha and Seok Jin chase Team SEVENTEEN...)

2153
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:18,955
(all the way to the mountain.)

2154
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,853
Come on.

2155
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:25,074
- Come on. Go easy on us. - Haha.

2156
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:26,949
Come on.

2157
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:28,364
(Seungkwan and So Min join the defense.)

2158
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:31,650
(Popping)

2159
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:34,418
(Ji Hyo scratches her balloon against a tree, and it pops.)

2160
01:12:34,419 --> 01:12:35,874
Your balloon has just popped.

2161
01:12:36,959 --> 01:12:39,151
- It hit the tree. - Really?

2162
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,412
Okay.

2163
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,828
I'm sure that we have many views.

2164
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:44,968
(Team SEVENTEEN's video is deleted.)

2165
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,138
That's unfortunate.

2166
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:47,439
(Order of the targets)

2167
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,699
- Isn't it the two of us? - It's just the two of us.

2168
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:49,850
Is it against each other?

2169
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:53,166
They have been eliminated. Let's go and catch Hani.

2170
01:12:53,179 --> 01:12:54,493
- Hurry and run. - Hani.

2171
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:55,689
Run.

2172
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:59,149
Tell everyone to climb down. All we can do is fight.

2173
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:00,178
Climb down.

2174
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:02,119
It's only us and Team Bo Reum.

2175
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,689
I don't know where Bo Reum is.

2176
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:04,918
(Where is Bo Reum?)

2177
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,071
Bo Reum.

2178
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,816
We should put her in a room.

2179
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:10,874
- That room? - For a little while.

2180
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,029
Come here.

2181
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:14,281
(As Bo Reum hides, Jong Kook and Se Chan search Team EXID.)

2182
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,383
Stay seated.

2183
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:18,211
Stay seated for now.

2184
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,411
Stay seated.

2185
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:21,338
It's over if they come in.

2186
01:13:21,339 --> 01:13:23,592
(Will she remain hidden?)

2187
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:24,909
- Jong Kook. - Shall I go upstairs?

2188
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:26,239
- I'll go upstairs. - Go.

2189
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,097
I'll go downstairs. Let's hurry. See you later.

2190
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,748
(Where is Team EXID?)

2191
01:13:31,749 --> 01:13:32,849
Where are they?

2192
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:34,849
Come here. Tell her to go there.

2193
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:36,418
(Team EXID doesn't hide and moves together.)

2194
01:13:36,419 --> 01:13:38,470
She shouldn't go alone.

2195
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,972
Be careful. There he is.

2196
01:13:40,259 --> 01:13:41,674
He saw us.

2197
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,650
Bo Reum is missing.

2198
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,458
(He spots Team EXID.)

2199
01:13:46,459 --> 01:13:47,509
Jong Kook!

2200
01:13:47,759 --> 01:13:49,376
They hid Bo Reum.

2201
01:13:49,469 --> 01:13:51,449
- Jong Kook. - Don't hide and let's fight.

2202
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:52,628
Kim Jong Kook.

2203
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:55,226
(The number of like keeps going up.)

2204
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:57,439
Let's just fight right away.

2205
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,338
- Jong Kook is going up. - Do you want a man-to-man fight?

2206
01:13:59,339 --> 01:14:00,451
Hani.

2207
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:02,138
Why are you holding a tree branch?

2208
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:04,078
(Behind them, Solji runs away.)

2209
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:05,208
(Se Chan goes through 3 people and runs after Solji.)

2210
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:06,248
No!

2211
01:14:06,249 --> 01:14:07,331
(Se Chan goes through 3 people and runs after Solji.)

2212
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,048
No, no!

2213
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:12,545
(It's over once she's caught.)

2214
01:14:13,089 --> 01:14:14,758
(Se Chan successfully chases after Solji.)

2215
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:17,088
Hold him.

2216
01:14:17,089 --> 01:14:18,099
(Haha blocks Se Chan.)

2217
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:19,699
Jong Kook.

2218
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:21,328
(She overcomes a crisis.)

2219
01:14:21,329 --> 01:14:23,692
Jong Kook, she went one floor down.

2220
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,328
There she is.

2221
01:14:25,329 --> 01:14:26,899
(Jong Kook hears Se Chan's cry.)

2222
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,092
(He runs as fast as he can after Solji.)

2223
01:14:29,509 --> 01:14:31,109
(Will she protect the balloon?)

2224
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:32,409
(Or will he pop it?)

2225
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:33,491
We're in trouble.

2226
01:14:34,139 --> 01:14:35,251
Where's Seok Jin?

2227
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,126
He went to look for Bo Reum.

2228
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:38,309
It's a matter of time.

2229
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:41,076
(Seok Jin looks for Bo Reum.)

2230
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:43,849
Gosh, we don't have time.

2231
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,263
(He heads to the room where Bo Reum is hiding.)

2232
01:14:45,589 --> 01:14:48,286
(She hears Seok Jin's voice right in front of her.)

2233
01:14:50,259 --> 01:14:54,928
(Will Seok Jin be able to find Bo Reum?)

2234
01:14:54,929 --> 01:14:56,099
(He passes by.)

2235
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,128
Where is she?

2236
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:58,413
(Where is she?)

2237
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,365
(I hope that he'll pass by.)

2238
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,535
(Jong Kook chases after Solji.)

2239
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,008
Who is it?

2240
01:15:07,009 --> 01:15:08,454
- What's going on? - Who is it?

2241
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:10,279
- Isn't it Jong Kook? - It is.

2242
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:11,592
(Let's go farther away.)

2243
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:13,078
You go first.

2244
01:15:13,079 --> 01:15:14,748
(Whose balloon will pop first?)

2245
01:15:14,749 --> 01:15:15,931
Where is she?

2246
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:18,248
What's this?

2247
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:20,644
(He finds the camera light inside the room.)

2248
01:15:21,259 --> 01:15:24,622
(He opens the door where the light came from.)

2249
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:27,214
You've been hiding here.

2250
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:28,498
Hey!

2251
01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:29,668
Hani, you go first.

2252
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:30,869
(Just then)

2253
01:15:30,870 --> 01:15:31,980
Girls.

2254
01:15:31,999 --> 01:15:33,439
- No. - Girls.

2255
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,638
- No. - Let's end this.

2256
01:15:34,639 --> 01:15:35,699
- No. - Hani.

2257
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,939
- No. - Solji.

2258
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:38,038
(She tries to block him with all her might.)

2259
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:39,168
Help me!

2260
01:15:39,169 --> 01:15:40,409
(She tries to block the door.)

2261
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,591
Please help me.

2262
01:15:42,209 --> 01:15:44,949
(Both teams are at risk now.)

2263
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:47,070
- Let's end this, Hani. - Go up more, Solji.

2264
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,048
(Solji's balloon)

2265
01:15:50,049 --> 01:15:51,918
(Or Bo Reum's balloon)

2266
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:53,418
No way.

2267
01:15:53,419 --> 01:15:54,904
Go farther, Solji.

2268
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:57,059
(Popping)

2269
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:58,958
(Solji's balloon pops.)

2270
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:00,009
It popped.

2271
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:02,899
(A tree branch pokes and pops her balloon.)

2272
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,010
Did it pop?

2273
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:05,985
(Yes, it did.)

2274
01:16:06,339 --> 01:16:07,498
It got stuck.

2275
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:09,638
(It's unbelievable.)

2276
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:11,739
(Dejected)

2277
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,922
It's okay. You did well.

2278
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,312
It got pocked by a tree branch.

2279
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,718
(Tail Catching Race is over.)

2280
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:20,861
Everyone.

2281
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,519
The last team that has survived is...

2282
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:24,863
- Team Bo Reum. - Okay.

2283
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:28,059
(If only it didn't get poked by a branch)

2284
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:31,826
Videos of other teams were deleted when they were eliminated.

2285
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:33,413
However, Team Bo Reum's video is still online.

2286
01:16:34,259 --> 01:16:35,258
Really?

2287
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:36,699
- Ours is still playing, right? - Really?

2288
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,689
- When will it stop? - Seriously.

2289
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:39,939
That was close.

2290
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:42,394
I'll announce the result based on the order of being eliminated.

2291
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:43,921
We're first.

2292
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:45,625
- Team Hye Yoon. - Yes.

2293
01:16:46,639 --> 01:16:50,548
The number of likes is 23,061.

2294
01:16:51,079 --> 01:16:53,078
- If we lasted longer... - That's unfortunate.

2295
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:54,999
If we lasted longer, we'd reach 100,000.

2296
01:16:55,049 --> 01:16:56,119
We were so close.

2297
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,968
Next is Team SEVENTEEN.

2298
01:16:58,089 --> 01:17:01,458
- The number of likes is 18,784. - Yes.

2299
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:03,489
(18,784 likes)

2300
01:17:03,490 --> 01:17:04,559
Yes.

2301
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:07,659
(Our number of likes is higher when we were eliminated first.)

2302
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,828
Wait a minute.

2303
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:10,214
We don't know yet.

2304
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:11,369
We don't know.

2305
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:13,769
- Ours must be higher. - We'd win if we had a week.

2306
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,338
We'd win if we had a week.

2307
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,569
Ours would definitely win.

2308
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,838
Team EXID.

2309
01:17:17,839 --> 01:17:19,168
(Team EXID's number of likes)

2310
01:17:19,169 --> 01:17:21,159
- The number of likes... - Please.

2311
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,809
- comes at 20,000 and... - It's high.

2312
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,548
(20,000...)

2313
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:27,540
(The first digit is the same as Team Hye Yoon's.)

2314
01:17:28,049 --> 01:17:30,619
(Will their number go higher than Team Hye Yoon?)

2315
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:32,509
21,284 likes.

2316
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:34,489
21,284 likes.

2317
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,489
(That was close.)

2318
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:37,105
We don't know yet.

2319
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,928
- We don't know. - We don't know yet.

2320
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,659
- Oh, no. - We have a chance.

2321
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:42,770
Zero?

2322
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,369
- Seriously. - Maybe we could win first place.

2323
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,599
We've stopped the countdown now.

2324
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,599
Just now?

2325
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,216
- We've just stopped. - Give us 10 more seconds.

2326
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,369
The number of likes.

2327
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:54,379
(Team Bo Reum's video was online for the longest time.)

2328
01:17:55,509 --> 01:17:58,109
(Did they record the highest number of likes?)

2329
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,735
17,902 likes.

2330
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:01,291
What?

2331
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,918
(We have the highest number of likes.)

2332
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:05,189
The winner is...

2333
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,079
Team Hye Yoon.

2334
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:09,159
They were eliminated first.

2335
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,846
- Yes. - Thank you.

2336
01:18:10,889 --> 01:18:11,958
Thank you.

2337
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:12,998
(All the honor goes to our netizens.)

2338
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:14,009
No way.

2339
01:18:14,299 --> 01:18:15,511
Her "Solo"?

2340
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,797
(The winner volunteers to perform again.)

2341
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,297
(We show the full version of Team Hye Yoon's video.)

2342
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:29,912
(Running Man Kim Hye Yoon)

2343
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:32,530
Guys, what are you doing?

2344
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:33,578
Move out of my way.

2345
01:18:33,579 --> 01:18:34,918
Move out of my way!

2346
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:41,519
(Running Man Kim Hye Yoon)

2347
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,229
(Running Man Kim Hye Yoon)

2348
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:44,240
How did I look?

2349
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:48,436
You're not that good at dancing as you think.

2350
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:51,990
I have a dancer's genes.

2351
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,801
I don't think you're that good.

2352
01:18:57,169 --> 01:18:58,453
Then bring Ms. Kim Joo Young.

2353
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,832
Bring Ms. Kim Joo Young now!

2354
01:19:01,110 --> 01:19:03,449
You're on Running Man.

2355
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:04,995
Kim Joo Young isn't here.

2356
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,999
Aren't you on Running Man today?

2357
01:19:07,249 --> 01:19:10,149
- Running Man, Kim Hye Yoon - Running Man, Kim Hye Yoon

2358
01:19:10,289 --> 01:19:13,350
- Running Man, Kim Hye Yoon - Running Man, Kim Hye Yoon

I beg you. Please.

2362
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:23,798
(It's the best race like a drama with a twist.)

2363
01:19:23,799 --> 01:19:24,981
This is great.

2364
01:19:25,169 --> 01:19:26,382
To Hye Yoon,

2365
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,399
we give a golden ring as a prize.

2366
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,869
(R-ring is given as a prize to Hye Yoon.)

2367
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:32,569
- I feel great. - Thank you.

2368
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:33,720
Gosh.

2369
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:36,503
(He's proud as a member of his agency wins.)

2370
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,949
I hope you didn't forget.

2371
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,718
Who's the winner of today's race?

2372
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,288
- Based on the real-time... - Most searched trending keyword.

2373
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:45,048
- That's right. - That's the winner.

2374
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:48,288
What's the prize for the final winner?

2375
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:49,458
(A benefit for today's winner)

2376
01:19:49,459 --> 01:19:51,859
We'll give you an additional keyword...

2377
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:53,244
of your choice.

2378
01:19:53,799 --> 01:19:56,759
That will be added to your time.

2379
01:19:57,429 --> 01:19:58,498
Ours is "Kim Hye Yoon".

2380
01:19:58,499 --> 01:19:59,628
"Kim Hye Yoon" would increase.

2381
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:00,838
- That's usually what happens. - Right.

2382
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,298
- Names are most searched. - We'll pick "Kim Hye Yoon".

2383
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:03,538
- Names are most searched. - Okay.

2384
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:04,609
2, 3.

2385
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:05,708
- "Kim Hye Yoon". - "Kim Hye Yoon".

2386
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:07,008
All right.

2387
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:08,678
Starting today at 5pm...

2388
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,811
to midnight, we'll sum the total.

2389
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,979
The final result will be announced next week.

(The final winner is announced next week.)

2391
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:17,748
- Okay. - It's up to midnight.

2392
01:20:17,749 --> 01:20:19,388
Let's hope for the result.

2393
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:20,673
- Please participate. - "Running Man Kim Hye Yoon".

2394
01:20:20,959 --> 01:20:23,010
- It can also be "Kim Hye Yoon" . - "Kim Hye Yoon".

01:20:23,089 --> 01:20:25,059

2396
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:27,150

2400
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:34,269
See you next week.

(Who will be the winner?)

2404
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,460
(You can find other team's videos on Running Man's social media.)

2405
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:44,578
(He made his first appearance on Running Man.)

2406
01:20:44,579 --> 01:20:47,979
(He's a secret agent of many talents.)

2407
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,172
(Yuims Bond)

2408
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:52,914
(January 2015,)

2409
01:20:53,089 --> 01:20:55,918
(Yuims Bond failed to find his successor.)

2410
01:20:55,919 --> 01:20:59,940
(He left Running Man and disappeared.)

2411
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,518
(4 years later)

2412
01:21:04,429 --> 01:21:07,733
(A mysterious place that awaits the members of Running Man)

2413
01:21:07,799 --> 01:21:10,609
(10 container boxes)

2414
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:13,239
(A prize of 100,000 dollars)

2415
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,849
(It's a money game of a huge scale.)

2416
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:19,309
(Or so they thought)

2417
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:23,158
(However)

2418
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:26,559
(Did Yuims Bond return after 4 years of silence?)

2419
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,859
(A secret mission that awaits him, and a mysterious client)

2420
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,758
(Why did he return?)

2421
01:21:31,759 --> 01:21:34,328
I'm curious why you never gave me a second chance.

2422
