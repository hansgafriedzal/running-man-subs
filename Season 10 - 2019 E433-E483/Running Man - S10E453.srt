1
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:07,832
Hello. Hello, there.

2
00:00:08,125 --> 00:00:10,032
- Hi. - Hello.

3
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,393
Hello.

4
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:12,393
- Hi. - Hello.

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:13,832
- Hello. - Hi.

6
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:15,457
Gosh, what's this?

7
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,810
What's that? That's LED.

8
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:22,017
It doesn't look like an electronic product, but a piece of furniture.

9
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,573
- Gosh, the TV looks nice. - It looks like furniture.

10
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:25,214
This will go great in any kinds of homes.

11
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,530
(This will go great in any kinds of homes.)

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,678
No, don't do that. You don't have to do that.

13
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:31,154
- You don't need to go that far. - Kwang Soo.

14
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:32,914
- I thought it was real. - Kwang Soo.

15
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:35,027
He said that whatever you say won't help the sales go up.

16
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:36,954
Why wouldn't that help?

17
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:38,393
- Look at that. - It doesn't help at all.

18
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:40,054
That's a painting. It's a frame for a painting.

19
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:42,164
- That looks nice. - Seok Jin. The condition is...

20
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,134
- How much is that? - that you mustn't talk.

21
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:46,134
- Hey, hey. - Seok Jin.

22
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:49,062
(There's no need for you to talk about the product.)

23
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:51,204
(My gosh. Is that so?)

24
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,473
- Show me the contract. - They don't want you to talk.

25
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,274
- Show me the contract. - No, no.

26
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:55,573
- The condition is... - Show me the document.

27
00:00:55,574 --> 00:00:56,674
- You should come separately. - that you should be...

28
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:59,073
- It's too early for your joke. - separated from the product.

29
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,384
- You're asking for me to punch you. - But you're here for the opening.

30
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:02,537
That's right.

31
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:03,954
- Okay, I got it. - Right.

32
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:05,414
- From what I've heard, - Okay.

33
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:08,423
Ji Hyo sends a coffee truck...

34
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:11,793
- to her colleagues. - Really?

35
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:13,793
(Ji Hyo sends a coffee truck? Even Jun Ho of 2PM confirmed it.)

36
00:01:13,794 --> 00:01:15,293
- Hey. - I've never seen that before.

37
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:16,593
- Coffee trucks? - Kwang Soo is...

38
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:17,933
in so many dramas and movies,

39
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,664
- but she's never sent one before. - Not even once.

40
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,763
To be honest, I knew about it, but I didn't mention it.

41
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:22,933
- Is that true? - Yes.

42
00:01:22,934 --> 00:01:23,933
- Hong Jong Hyun. - From what I know,

43
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:25,774
she sent one for Hong Jong Hyun whom she's not close with.

44
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,774
- Jun Ho of 2PM. - Jun Ho.

45
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:28,843
- Really? - Yes.

46
00:01:28,844 --> 00:01:30,543
- I have a story behind that. - What's the story behind it?

47
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:32,373
- Do you not have a story with me? - I...

48
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,944
We don't have a story when it's been a decade?

49
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:35,144
- Listen. - My gosh.

50
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:36,644
(We've made so many stories over the 10 years.)

51
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,214
- If that's her excuse... - No stories over the 10 years?

52
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:40,734
- My gosh, Ji Hyo. That was mean. - I wasn't going to bring this up.

53
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,123
I really didn't want to...

54
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:43,854
- bring this up. - I give you love instead.

55
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:44,854
When did you give him love?

56
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,224
- I give you a lot of love instead. - When?

57
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:48,123
- Kwang Soo, did you send her one? - My goodness.

58
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,224
(Kwang Soo, did you send her one?)

59
00:01:50,225 --> 00:01:52,033
- After that... - Hey, did you send me one?

60
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,033
Did you send her one?

61
00:01:53,034 --> 00:01:55,203
But to be fair, he didn't send it to other people.

62
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,004
- No, he sent one to So Min. - These days, she's really popular.

63
00:01:57,005 --> 00:02:00,033
- No, he sent one to So Min. - There were so many articles.

64
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,373
(He sent one to So Min.)

65
00:02:01,374 --> 00:02:02,474
- Hey, you. - He sent one with Se Chan.

66
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,774
- It was from both of them. - You sent one to So Min?

67
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:07,013
- It was from Se Chan too. - He and I sent one together.

68
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,744
- You got nothing to complain about. - Hey, you.

69
00:02:08,745 --> 00:02:10,084
- Hey, go back to your spot. - Hey.

70
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,683
How could you? It's been nine years.

71
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,014
- This is understandable. - You guys are the same.

72
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,753
- Go back. - It's been a decade between us.

73
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,024
And you were mad at that?

74
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:17,324
Be quiet. You're at a disadvantage.

75
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:19,293
- Why are you mad if you're sorry? - What?

76
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,468
- Why did you do that? - You caused trouble.

77
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:24,494
We don't need to send each other coffee trucks.

78
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,163
- Right. - Everyone.

79
00:02:26,164 --> 00:02:27,603
Today we're here to prepare...

80
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:29,864
for the fan-meet for the Ninth Anniversary of Running Man.

81
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,674
It's the 2nd episode of 9 Years of Running Man.

82
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:33,744
Today, we'll choose two members...

83
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:35,644
who will perform as a pair during the fan-meet.

84
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,044
- As a pair? - There are two people.

85
00:02:37,045 --> 00:02:38,774
- I remember that it was 2 people. - 2 people?

86
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:40,581
My gosh, they'll perform as a pair.

87
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:43,908
As for their performance, the staff will not intervene.

88
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:45,954
The chosen two members for the performance...

89
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:48,484
will be responsible for everything regarding the performance.

90
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:49,924
My gosh, that's a lot of pressure.

91
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,394
- That's a lot of pressure. - It's a lot of pressure.

92
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:53,093
- Seriously. - That's a lot of pressure.

93
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:54,563
It's a penalty. It's sort of like a penalty.

94
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:55,663
It's a penalty. It totally is.

95
00:02:55,664 --> 00:02:57,602
- It's better not to do this. - It's a penalty.

96
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,334
If I get to choose two members,

97
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:01,503
I'd choose Ji Hyo and So Min.

98
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,804
- Yes, that's a good idea. - Yes, that's good.

99
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:05,204
- This is a good pairing. - It's nice and fresh.

100
00:03:05,205 --> 00:03:07,774
Besides, there might be good chemistry between them,

101
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:08,943
- but there's none. - Right.

102
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:10,304
- That's really strange too. - I'm serious.

103
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:12,373
- They have to forge chemistry. - It's been two years.

104
00:03:12,374 --> 00:03:13,783
The chemistry between the two is non-existent.

105
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,214
- I've done it. - Hey, we should help them out.

106
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:17,653
No, you're pushing it onto us because you guys don't want it.

107
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,153
- No. - No, no.

108
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:21,283
- What are you talking about? - It's a misunderstanding.

109
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,883
- This is definitely a penalty. - It's for you girls.

110
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:25,853
Before we start today's race,

111
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:29,123
you'll watch a video that we've prepared.

112
00:03:29,124 --> 00:03:30,593
- There's a video? - We have a video?

113
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:33,093
- Is that it? - Everyone, please look at the TV.

114
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:34,103
Where?

115
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,403
- That's the TV? - That's the TV?

116
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,274
- What's this? - I've given one to Se Chan.

117
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,674
- What's it? - What's that?

118
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,000
- Do you have to put it next to it? - Does that stick there?

119
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:41,644
- What are you doing? - I'm connecting it.

120
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:43,541
- Hey, something is on the screen. - It's on.

121
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:45,174
The video in his phone is transferred to the screen.

122
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:46,274
- I guess. - That actually works.

123
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,611
This is even more interesting. Look.

124
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,183
(The TV can rotate to the side?)

125
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,413
Isn't this amazing?

126
00:03:50,414 --> 00:03:52,084
(They'll play the video on a cutting-edge device today.)

127
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:53,153
My gosh. Goodness.

128
00:03:53,154 --> 00:03:54,484
- Hey, you must work here. - It's like that horizontal phone.

129
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,024
- It's the horizontal phone! - Right.

130
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,593
- It's so cutting-edge. - This is amazing.

131
00:03:57,594 --> 00:03:58,593
- "To my grandchildren". - "To my grandchildren".

132
00:03:58,594 --> 00:03:59,794
(When they're mesmerized by the device,)

133
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:02,093
(the video starts playing.)

134
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:05,033
I bet you guys are all grown up now.

135
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,033
(To my grandchildren)

136
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,163
- "To my grandchildren". - This really rotated.

137
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,236
(I bet you guys are all grown up now.)

138
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:12,734
(We're their grandchildren?)

139
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:13,866
Are we their grandchildren?

140
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:19,074
We haven't seen you puppies for a long time because we went...

141
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,743
on our trip all around the world to fulfill our dreams.

142
00:04:20,744 --> 00:04:22,913
- On a trip around the world? - Someone else must be here.

143
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:26,016
We've missed you so much as our memories are fading away.

144
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,863
This voice sounds very familiar.

145
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:30,653
We've climbed the Great Wall.

146
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:32,021
They went to China.

147
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,593
- We've been to the pyramids too. - Egypt.

148
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,423
- Egypt. - That must've been hard.

149
00:04:35,424 --> 00:04:36,423
And we've traveled through...

150
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:37,434
- the Almighty the Arctic Ocean too. - The Arctic Ocean?

151
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:38,663
- They went far. - My gosh.

152
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:39,694
Did they have to go that far?

153
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,764
We even fought against a group of crocodiles in the Amazon too.

154
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,131
- My gosh. - And at last,

155
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,428
we found a gift for you!

156
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:48,774
(For us?)

157
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:49,973
- Is that treasure? - Treasure?

158
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:53,913
- Treasure? - We found a gift for you!

159
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:56,129
(Is that some kind of treasure?)

160
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,014
- We found such a precious gift. - Is it treasure?

161
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,617
- It's a card. - It's a blank check.

162
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:02,153
We managed to find an exemption ticket for the couple performance...

163
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:03,684
- after 30 years. - What?

164
00:05:04,195 --> 00:05:06,394
(An exemption ticket for the couple performance?)

165
00:05:06,395 --> 00:05:08,324
- Sure, it's so precious. - that's amazing.

166
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,163
- It's very valuable. - It sure is.

167
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,564
- It's valuable. - Yes, indeed.

168
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,064
- It's valuable. - Yes, it is.

169
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,064
Just trust us.

170
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,374
We'll depart for Korea soon.

171
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,134
- Come to our house quickly. - My gosh.

172
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:21,654
- Where is it? - We miss you very much.

173
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,673
(Their grandparents came back to Korea with the exemption ticket.)

174
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,756
- We have to go to their house? - Where's their house?

175
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:28,184
Before you set out to your grandparents' house,

176
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:30,954
you'll decide the rankings and jobs as their grandchildren.

177
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,153
- Okay. - Jobs?

178
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,754
- "Rankings and jobs"? - What do the rankings mean?

179
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:35,084
I guess we all have different jobs.

180
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,493
"First grandson, studying to take the bar exam for a long time."

181
00:05:37,494 --> 00:05:39,769
- Are these predetermined? - The youngest is in eighth grade.

182
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,194
All right.

183
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,894
"A member of a new girl group".

184
00:05:42,895 --> 00:05:44,894
You're the grandchildren of Family R.

185
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,493
There are 4 grandsons and 4 granddaughters.

186
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:47,504
- Okay. - There are four granddaughters?

187
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:48,504
- Four? - What?

188
00:05:48,505 --> 00:05:49,964
- There are 4 granddaughters. - There are 4?

189
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:51,473
- Yes. - We must dress up like girls.

190
00:05:51,474 --> 00:05:52,874
Eight stickers that tell you...

191
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,659
about the jobs and rankings are hidden all over this building.

192
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:58,473
Find the sticker. If you put it either on you or another member,

193
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,107
the member will be fixed with the job.

194
00:06:00,315 --> 00:06:02,865
You cannot remove the sticker once you've put it on a body.

195
00:06:02,914 --> 00:06:04,314
That means it's over for that person.

196
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:07,324
Yes, if there are two stickers on your body at the end of the race,

197
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,384
you will play rock-paper-scissors with a member without stickers.

198
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:12,024
- And the winner will get to choose. - Okay.

199
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,493
Don't you think the wrestler will have a hard time today?

200
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,124
- Yes, I think so. - It suits you.

201
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,334
I want to be the bar exam student or the lawyer.

202
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,201
- You'd make a good wrestler. - That will be neat.

203
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,064
- Yes, the lawyer sounds good. - I want the zookeeper.

204
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,204
- Zookeeper. - I want to be the zookeeper.

205
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,403
It means war. Great.

206
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:26,006
(Family Tree of Family R)

207
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:27,494
Get ready.

208
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,043
All right.

209
00:06:29,044 --> 00:06:30,103
Jong Kook is in the front again.

210
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:31,774
- Only Haha will benefit from it. - Let's go.

211
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:32,795
Only Haha will benefit.

212
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:35,573
- From which floor? - I'll search here first.

213
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:40,584
(They can put the stickers on themselves or on other members.)

214
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:41,605
Here it is.

215
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:43,283
(Kwang Soo has found the envelope with the sticker first.)

216
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:44,447
What is it?

217
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:46,593
"First grandson, long-time bar exam student."

218
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:47,663
Hey!

219
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,324
Hey, give me that.

220
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,033
(I found one too.)

221
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,093
(Jae Seok has also obtained a sticker soon after.)

222
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,964
Right here. Right here.

223
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:56,698
(I should quickly find one too.)

224
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,527
My gosh, here.

225
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:00,403
Where is it?

226
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:01,403
(He gets close to Seok Jin quietly.)

227
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,466
You startled me!

228
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:03,766
What was that?

229
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,286
You're a member of a top girl group.

230
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:07,684
Hey! Darn it.

231
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:09,283
The third-oldest granddaughter, a top girl group member.

232
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:10,384
You're unbelievable.

233
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:12,184
(Meanwhile, Jong Kook is looking for the sticker furiously.)

234
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,205
(Rushing)

235
00:07:13,854 --> 00:07:16,069
(So Min climbs after Jong Kook.)

236
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,358
(Here's your sticker.)

237
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:20,194
Hey, she put something on me.

238
00:07:20,195 --> 00:07:22,163
(He's forced to become an eighth grader, the youngest.)

239
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,379
- You're the youngest granddaughter. - Oh, no!

240
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,877
I really don't want to dress up like a girl.

241
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,903
- There's nothing here. - I don't want to dress up.

242
00:07:28,904 --> 00:07:32,374
(Jong Kook finds another sticker, his only hope.)

243
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,935
- Jong Kook. - Did you find one?

244
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,811
- Jong Kook. - My gosh.

245
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:38,214
My gosh, this is...

246
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:40,214
- What is it? - This one is bad too.

247
00:07:40,215 --> 00:07:42,543
(He obtains 2 stickers for granddaughters.)

248
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:44,853
I don't want to dress up, but I have two girl stickers.

249
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:45,913
(Current Status of Obtained Stickers)

250
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,014
(Long-time bar exam student, lawyer, girl group member, wrestler,)

251
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:48,024
(zookeeper, fortune-teller, eighth grader, girl group member)

252
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:49,147
Time is up.

253
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:51,493
All right, everyone. We'll check now.

254
00:07:51,494 --> 00:07:53,463
Whom am I supposed to play rock-paper-scissors with?

255
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,564
- Jong Kook... There's no volunteer. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

256
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:57,564
- You have to. - Come here if you want wrestler.

257
00:07:57,565 --> 00:07:59,093
- In my opinion, the four of you... - Okay.

258
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,217
- Okay. - I should go for this one.

259
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:01,564
I should go for this one.

260
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,403
- I want the zookeeper. - If I win, I can choose, right?

261
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,619
- I want to go for the zookeeper. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

262
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:07,173
- I want to try that. - Is that so?

263
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,374
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

264
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,043
(So Min wins, and Jae Seok loses.)

265
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:11,341
- So Min, go for the zookeeper. - Okay.

266
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:12,673
You're going to win.

267
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,215
It's either fortune-teller or the granddaughter.

268
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:15,483
- rock-paper... - Ready or not,

269
00:08:15,484 --> 00:08:17,983
- rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

270
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:20,954
(So Min loses, and Haha wins.)

271
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:22,024
Okay.

272
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:23,454
(Since Haha is the winner, he'll choose one for her.)

273
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:24,824
(He gives her the sticker for the wrestler.)

274
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:26,017
Why did you do that?

275
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:29,743
- Listen, So Min. - It's fun to see her as a wrestler.

276
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:30,886
- That's right. - Why?

277
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:32,794
- That's great. - Why did you go for that?

278
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,130
You can't take it off once it's on.

279
00:08:34,535 --> 00:08:36,704
- Right. That's great for you. - Why did you go against Haha?

280
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,530
- You should've gone with Jong Kook. - I wanted to go for the zookeeper.

281
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:41,034
Choose whichever one you want.

282
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,373
- Hey, it's either fortune-teller... - This is crazy.

283
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,914
Jae Seok, the fortune-teller one is better than the other one.

284
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,214
- No, no. - Rock-paper-scissors

285
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:48,407
- That's not right. - You choose.

286
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:50,311
You can never win, can you?

287
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:52,711
My goodness.

288
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,723
- That one is better. That's better. - Seriously.

289
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:56,554
- I'm going to... - Yes, you should give that to him.

290
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,523
- Should I be the fortune-teller? - I should be a middle schooler.

291
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,768
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

292
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:02,623
- Watch out. I'm in eighth grade. - What do you have?

293
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:05,216
Hey, kids in eighth grade are going through puberty.

294
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,334
- I'm at the rebellious age. - We're in big trouble.

295
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:08,664
I'm at that phase. You'd better watch out.

296
00:09:08,665 --> 00:09:10,296
This is no joke.

297
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,133
(Bar exam student, lawyer, top girl group member, wrestler,)

298
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:14,878
(fortune-teller, zookeeper, girl group member, eighth grader)

299
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,475
Younger ones, hurry up.

300
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,843
(The grandchildren show up in their disguises.)

301
00:09:19,844 --> 00:09:21,447
I have the most ordinary role today.

302
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,915
All right. 2nd and 3rd siblings. Come on out.

303
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:26,458
(She bumps her head against the youngest.)

304
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,185
(Come here, you youngest.)

305
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:33,093
- That's not how you play it. - That's not it.

306
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,523
That's not how you play it.

307
00:09:34,524 --> 00:09:36,064
(The fourth-oldest suddenly wrestles with the youngest.)

308
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,115
Look at you.

309
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:38,834
- Mr. Lawyer. - Yes, I'm the lawyer.

310
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:39,934
(Ji Hyo, a member of a new girl group and Haha, zookeeper)

311
00:09:39,935 --> 00:09:41,741
You're so scary. Gosh.

312
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:43,964
- You look so scary. - Jong Kook looks scary.

313
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,633
- How could you look this scary? - I know, right?

314
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:47,206
(The scariest eighth grader, Kook Soon)

315
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:48,503
You're so scary.

316
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,667
My brother.

317
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,783
- Do you work at funerals? - Hold on. Hey.

318
00:09:52,045 --> 00:09:53,944
- I'm a lawyer. - You are?

319
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:55,184
- You look scary. - I'm a lawyer despite my look.

320
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,123
I thought you worked for a funeral service company.

321
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,221
My gosh, this is crazy.

322
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,507
- What's that? - Seok Jin.

323
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:03,148
I'm in a girl group.

324
00:10:03,325 --> 00:10:04,493
- Really? - You're in a girl group?

325
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,647
I'm in a girl group.

326
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,194
He's in the fife and drum band.

327
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:09,337
Gosh, he scared me!

328
00:10:09,994 --> 00:10:11,294
What is this?

329
00:10:11,295 --> 00:10:12,464
(Jae Ni, the fortune-teller in pink, shows up.)

330
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:14,402
It looks good on him. It does.

331
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:16,434
- Hello. - Look at you two.

332
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:18,270
I've seen you two from somewhere.

333
00:10:18,305 --> 00:10:20,103
- Who am I? Am I a band leader? - Hold on.

334
00:10:20,104 --> 00:10:22,389
Forget about everything. But Jong Kook is supposed to be a girl?

335
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,643
- Give me an outfit that fits me. - He looks nothing like a girl.

336
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:28,243
- The sleeves are ripped here. - Seriously.

337
00:10:28,244 --> 00:10:29,284
Iron Min.

338
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,714
Give us better outfits.

339
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:32,714
- She's in a girl group. - Girl groups don't dress like this.

340
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,883
- He's on "How Is That Possible?". - I've seen him.

341
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,507
(He must be on the show, "How Is That Possible?")

342
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:39,253
I've seen an old man who dresses up like a girl.

343
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:40,857
- Right, exactly. - Yes, that's true!

344
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,878
We heard that an old man roams around Seoul in a girl's clothes.

345
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,164
- Hey, I'm in a girl group. - She's really in a girl group?

346
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,869
- I'm in a girl group. - No, that's not true.

347
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:52,853
Sir, please live a long life!

348
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,132
That's right! Yes!

349
00:10:55,344 --> 00:10:58,074
- I'm not an old man. I'm a girl. - Wait.

350
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:01,685
You'll set out to your grandparents' house now.

351
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:03,414
Gosh, I'm on Garosu-gil today.

352
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:04,714
It's a shame that I might leave now.

353
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:06,154
Where would you go in this costume?

354
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,353
- That's not a problem for me. - We can...

355
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,983
We can sit at a cafe on Garosu-gil.

356
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,893
- You know? We can sip Americano. - That's right.

357
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:13,623
People will report you two if both of you are at a cafe.

358
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,582
(People will report you two if both of you are at a cafe.)

359
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,774
- We can observe people. - You'll get reported.

360
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,363
- Let's get going for now. - Shouldn't we do that?

361
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,375
The pink wig looks great on Jae Seok.

362
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:24,103
- It looks great on him. - Yes, it does.

363
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:25,773
Pink hair suits you much better than black hair.

364
00:11:25,774 --> 00:11:27,434
(They set out to meet their grandparents in 30 years.)

365
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,036
I wonder where we are going. You know?

366
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:31,044
By the way, they look like sisters.

367
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:32,851
Jae Seok and Seok Jin look like real sisters.

368
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:35,122
Thank you for saying that.

369
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,815
I have a story. Let me tell you.

370
00:11:40,155 --> 00:11:42,654
I'm doing this because my brother likes playing dress-up.

371
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:44,461
- Hey, hey. - That's why...

372
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:48,593
(A kind brother and a brother who likes to dress up like a girl)

373
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:49,893
Stop lying.

374
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,464
- You're ridiculous. - That's so sad.

375
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,045
My brother's story has been on "How Is That Possible?"

376
00:11:54,864 --> 00:11:56,263
- That's sad. - You're very thoughtful.

377
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:57,804
- I am, right? - You're so kind.

378
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:59,674
- You almost made me cry. - You're so kind.

379
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,674
- You almost cried, didn't you? - I almost cried.

380
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,704
- His younger brother plays along. - It's a sad story.

381
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:05,785
- You hope he'll be sane someday. - Right.

382
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,931
Se Chan, what's the case you're working on these days?

383
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,544
- The case I'm defending now? - Yes.

384
00:12:10,545 --> 00:12:13,383
I'm just on a case for my business. It's a construction case.

385
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,914
- What case? - Construction case.

386
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,054
Which construction?

387
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:17,383
- Hold on. - To buy the property...

388
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,497
- To buy the property... - Do you know what a lawyer does?

389
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,658
I defend my clients, don't I?

390
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:22,848
Listen.

391
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:25,275
Tell me about the separation of powers.

392
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:26,415
What separation?

393
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,743
(What's that?)

394
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,770
- Separation of powers? - A lawyer should know that.

395
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:34,103
- You don't know that? - Hey.

396
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,502
What's prohibition against double jeopardy then?

397
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:37,373
- Double jeopardy? - Yes, double jeopardy.

398
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:38,513
Prohibition against double jeopardy...

399
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:40,146
You should tell us what it is, sister.

400
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,684
- What? - What's that?

401
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:43,072
- I know what it is, punk. - What is it?

402
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,383
Don't call me punk, sister.

403
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:46,966
(Don't call me punk, sister.)

404
00:12:47,585 --> 00:12:49,654
- How could you call me that? - Hey, we're sisters.

405
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:51,623
- I can't even call my sister punk? - How could you?

406
00:12:51,624 --> 00:12:52,753
- We're sisters. - But...

407
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:53,993
You can't call me that though.

408
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,723
I used to change your diapers when you were a baby.

409
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:56,993
Diapers? Stop lying.

410
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:58,294
You and I have a big age difference.

411
00:12:58,295 --> 00:13:00,304
These days, I'm the one changing your diapers.

412
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:02,863
- That's so sad. - Exactly.

413
00:13:02,864 --> 00:13:04,704
- She's so nice. - This is sad.

414
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,904
- You're so nice. You are. - Yes, I am.

415
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:09,119
- I take care of my sister. - You're so kind.

416
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:12,143
Since you're the fortune-teller, you should read our fortunes.

417
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:13,574
- Yes, read our fortunes. - Should I?

418
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,784
Tell us what will happen to us.

419
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:17,444
What do you say? Can I get married this year?

420
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:18,913
- Will I get married? - You?

421
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,853
- You got married last year. - You're married.

422
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,223
- Really? - Yes.

423
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:23,990
- You got married three times. - Really?

424
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,623
- I keep forgetting things. - She forgets easily.

425
00:13:25,624 --> 00:13:27,154
And you used to be a guy too.

426
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:29,164
What? I'm a guy now?

427
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,001
Hey, I'm your sister in this play.

428
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:33,430
He got out of his role. He got out of his role just now.

429
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:34,664
- Seriously. - He got out of his role.

430
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,704
- You're confusing me. Stop. - What's up with you?

431
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,304
Are we still role-playing or not?

432
00:13:38,305 --> 00:13:39,934
- Choose one. - My goodness.

433
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,574
- What's your ranking? - I'm the seventh-oldest.

434
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:42,843
- 7th-oldest. - 7th-oldest? Goodness.

435
00:13:42,844 --> 00:13:44,714
My gosh, our parents...

436
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,914
They created a masterpiece together.

437
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,853
- we are too ugly except her. - By the way,

438
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,483
- She should be in a girl group now. - She's pretty.

439
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,013
- Seriously. - How many years has it been?

440
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,637
- Wait. I'll debut soon. - She still hasn't debuted?

441
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,993
By the way, you've been saying that you'd debut for 20 years now.

442
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,324
She's the whole package as long as no one finds out about her past.

443
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,385
(The youngest is brutally honest.)

444
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:05,834
(This is a statement from the youngest.)

445
00:14:05,835 --> 00:14:07,534
Actually, the fact that she hasn't debuted might be...

446
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:09,003
- a blessing in disguise. - That's true.

447
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,596
Let's say that she makes a debut now.

448
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:13,233
If she becomes popular, people will look her up.

449
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:14,503
- Hey, take me for example. - That's right.

450
00:14:14,504 --> 00:14:16,074
When I was at my peak,

451
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:19,174
the scandal with Gong Yoo ruined my career. Look where I am now.

452
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,843
- Seok Jin, what's wrong with you? - What?

453
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:22,643
(The role-playing is off now.)

454
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,853
- Please! - Stop dressing up like a woman!

455
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,517
I'm your sister!

456
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:28,584
If there wasn't a scandal with Gong Yoo...

457
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:30,554
- Poor Seok Jin. - Goodness.

458
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,954
Seok Jin, if you go too far with the role-playing,

459
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,250
we can't go along with it.

460
00:14:34,864 --> 00:14:36,664
(Do it right.)

461
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,633
It was just enough. The scandal with Gong Yoo.

462
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:39,887
It was totally dope.

463
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,099
- "Dope"? - What's that?

464
00:14:42,435 --> 00:14:45,233
I can't put my finger on it, but don't we look like...

465
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:46,805
a circus troupe on our way to perform?

466
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,103
- Family troupe to perform a show. - Seriously.

467
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,502
- It's a family troupe. - We're a circus troupe.

468
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,574
- It's the whole family. - Is this it? Did we arrive?

469
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:53,738
My gosh, look at the house!

470
00:14:54,884 --> 00:14:55,966
Are they over there?

471
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,136
Grandma!

472
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,383
Grandpa!

473
00:14:58,384 --> 00:15:00,659
My gosh, our grandparents are loaded.

474
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:03,205
- How many houses are there? - They are totally rich.

475
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:05,331
- I didn't know they were this rich. - My grandma is rich.

476
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,427
Grandma, we're here!

477
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,564
- Grandma. - Grandma!

478
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,431
- We had no idea that you were rich. - Grandma.

479
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,073
Your oldest grandson is here.

480
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:15,503
- Your second-oldest is here. - Is there...

481
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:17,269
Is there a big show in the vicinity?

482
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,704
- Is there a show here? - No, this isn't a circus.

483
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,582
Everyone, it's the biggest show on earth!

484
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:23,847
By the way, we should meet with our grandparents.

485
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,544
(Opening)

486
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,284
- They're here! - Grandma!

487
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:30,998
- My puppies are here. - My gosh.

488
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,034
Really?

489
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:35,042
(Grandma Im Soo Hyang, Grandpa Lee Sang Yeob)

490
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:38,355
(They are our grandparents?)

491
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,353
- You're here. - Grandpa.

492
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:41,623
(Welcome, my dear grandchildren.)

493
00:15:41,624 --> 00:15:43,359
- Hey, you. - It's nice to see you.

494
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:45,608
- Why are you wearing that? - Grandpa.

495
00:15:45,634 --> 00:15:47,123
They put on the disguise before their introductions.

496
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:49,204
Grandma.

497
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,733
(Who is that guy with the yellow wig?)

498
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:51,904
You look older than Grandma.

499
00:15:51,905 --> 00:15:54,455
(You look older than Grandma.)

500
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:55,597
Grandpa.

501
00:15:55,774 --> 00:15:58,468
- Why do you look so old? - Grandma.

502
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:01,331
- Grandpa is wearing nice shoes. - Grandpa.

503
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:03,743
- He knows hip hop. - I knew he was loaded.

504
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:06,454
I'm a grandpa who knows hip hop.

505
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:09,035
You should behave well before the youngest takes your shoes.

506
00:16:09,484 --> 00:16:11,219
- You might lose your shoes to her. - Be careful.

507
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:13,954
What kind of grandpa is he? He's so scared.

508
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,393
You should act like a grandpa.

509
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:16,664
(The race starts with their grandparents.)

510
00:16:16,665 --> 00:16:18,493
By the way, we only have five grandchildren.

511
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,794
Why did eight of you come?

512
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:23,464
(We only have 5 grandchildren. Why did 8 of you come?)

513
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:26,733
(They only have five grandchildren?)

514
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:27,969
What is he saying?

515
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:29,765
What is this?

516
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,453
- What about the other 3? - 3 of us weren't family.

517
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,197
We only have five grandchildren.

518
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,876
- Exactly. - I knew there was a twist.

519
00:16:38,514 --> 00:16:39,984
- I knew there was a twist. Ma'am. - I...

520
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:41,383
Ma'am? You're an old lady.

521
00:16:41,384 --> 00:16:43,223
(Excuse me, ma'am.)

522
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,324
- She's an old lady. - I knew it.

523
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,517
It's so obvious that these two are fakes.

524
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:46,694
Hey.

525
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:48,723
- Run the DNA test! - I knew it.

526
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,907
- I'm their real granddaughter. - Something was off about her.

527
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:52,789
I'm related to them.

528
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,150
All right. Three of you...

529
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,973
are not the real grandchildren...

530
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:00,279
who are eyeing exemption ticket for the couple performance.

531
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:05,107
(3 of them are fake family members.)

532
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,543
(Some of us are fakes?)

533
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:09,444
- 3 of us... 3 of us... - My gosh.

534
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,945
- It's so obvious. I knew it. - Three of us?

535
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,354
I saw this coming.

536
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:13,507
Okay. I know who it is.

537
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,972
And among the real grandchildren,

538
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:19,624
there is the most-beloved grandchild of the grandparents.

539
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,880
- The most-beloved grandchild? - What?

540
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:23,441
- The most-beloved grandchild? - There's another twist.

541
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:27,041
(Why is he reacting this way?)

542
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,736
And the most-beloved grandchild...

543
00:17:28,905 --> 00:17:31,473
already knows 2 of 3 fake grandchildren.

544
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,874
(The most-beloved grandchild knows 2 of 3 fake grandchildren.)

545
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,444
- Two of them? - There's a spy here.

546
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,851
That member already knows 2 of 3 fake grandchildren.

547
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:39,368
That brings me to my next point.

548
00:17:39,415 --> 00:17:41,013
The real grandchildren and the most-beloved grandchild...

549
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,678
must find out who the three fake grandchildren are.

550
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,983
The fake grandchildren must eliminate...

551
00:17:44,984 --> 00:17:46,214
the most-beloved grandchild in order to win.

552
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:47,336
- The fake grandchildren? - My gosh.

553
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:48,723
My gosh, this is...

554
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:50,283
(Real grandchildren versus fake grandchildren)

555
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,293
The most-beloved grandchild is on our side.

556
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,424
- Right. - By the way,

557
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:55,523
I don't know if I should share this. But let me just say this.

558
00:17:55,524 --> 00:17:57,127
When we were getting off the bus, Jong Kook said,

559
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,694
"Grandpas love the youngest daughters the most."

560
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,604
- That's what he said. - Do you remember that?

561
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:03,503
- Do you? - I remember it too.

562
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:05,003
(While on their way to their grandparents...)

563
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:07,033
Grandparents love the youngest the most.

564
00:18:07,034 --> 00:18:09,759
(Was this a confession?)

565
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:12,144
I said that when there were no cameras.

566
00:18:12,145 --> 00:18:13,313
- No. - There was one inside.

567
00:18:13,314 --> 00:18:15,048
- There was one inside. - Oh, really?

568
00:18:15,115 --> 00:18:16,944
- I didn't mean much by it. - He's flustered.

569
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:19,606
- He is. - It's about time he became one.

570
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:20,654
You're right.

571
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:22,155
I swear. It's not me.

572
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:24,924
(Jae Seok interrupts them.)

573
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,023
It was you!

574
00:18:26,024 --> 00:18:27,354
- It was you! - The fortune-teller...

575
00:18:27,355 --> 00:18:28,624
- will reveal the truth! - Calm down.

576
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,493
- You should know the truth. - Right.

577
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,394
- That's right. - You're a fortune-teller.

578
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,067
- He's a fortune-teller. - Come on, perform your ritual.

579
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:36,864
My goodness.

580
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,374
For today's mission,

581
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,303
you'll be divided into Team Grandpa and Team Grandma.

582
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:42,704
- Okay. - This is important.

583
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,643
The hints you'll be given will differ.

584
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:46,773
If Team Grandpa wins,

585
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:48,644
your grandpa will choose one team member to whom a hint...

586
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,276
regarding the most-beloved grandchild will be given.

587
00:18:50,915 --> 00:18:52,184
If Team Grandma wins,

588
00:18:52,185 --> 00:18:53,483
your grandma will choose one team member...

589
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:54,854
- One? - who will receive a hint...

590
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,252
regarding the three fakes.

591
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,323
- We should go to Team Grandma. - Right.

592
00:18:58,324 --> 00:18:59,924
- Yes. - We should find out the fakes.

593
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:01,194
But those fakes...

594
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:03,424
might team up with Sang Yeob in order to receive hints.

595
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,833
- About the most-beloved grandson? - Right.

596
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,833
Those who are fakes will try to team up with him.

597
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,003
- They're smart. - They'll attempt to do so.

598
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:12,269
The losing team will receive water bombs.

599
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:15,374
They will also be confirmed to join the couple performance.

600
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,404
- We must win no matter what. - You're right.

601
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,404
We must win.

602
00:19:17,405 --> 00:19:20,473
Both of the grandparents will also receive water bombs if they lose.

603
00:19:20,474 --> 00:19:21,483
We must win.

604
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:23,279
- Shall we do rock-paper-scissors? - Sure.

605
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,553
- Rock-paper-scissors - Rock-paper-scissors

606
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:26,778
(Results for Rock-Paper-Scissors)

607
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,723
Who won?

608
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:30,969
- I choose Team Grandma. - Okay.

609
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:32,654
(He wants to receive hints about the fakes.)

610
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:33,654
I must go there.

611
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:35,155
- I must go there too. - I need to find the fakes.

612
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,194
- I should go there. - Then...

613
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:38,864
- I'll go to Team Grandpa. - From the way I see it...

614
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,977
(Se Chan chooses Team Grandpa.)

615
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:43,934
- That's strange. Why? - What?

616
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,303
You're being suspicious.

617
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:46,704
There are fakes among us.

618
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:47,934
- You must be a fake. - Right.

619
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:49,243
- You're a fake. - I'm...

620
00:19:49,244 --> 00:19:50,803
- Why did you pick that team? - I need to protect the hints.

621
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:52,714
There are three fakes among us.

622
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:54,614
(Is he truly going to prevent the fakes from getting the hints?)

623
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:56,813
(Team Grandma: Jong Kook, Haha, Ji Hyo, Jae Seok)

624
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,583
(Team Grandpa: Seok Jin, Kwang Soo, Se Chan, So Min)

625
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,384
It's highly likely that the most-beloved grandchild...

626
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:01,823
is in this team.

627
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:03,384
- Right. - Because they only need...

628
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,454
to know one more...

629
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,454
- Right. - with the hints.

630
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,045
But they might end up in this team after losing in rock-paper-scissors.

631
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,424
Yes, they might be unlucky.

632
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:11,435
- That's plausible. - It's a pity.

633
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:12,934
(Kwang Soo,)

634
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:15,003
(look at that plane.)

635
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,003
(Why is Jae Seok pointing at a plane?)

636
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:17,263
- What is it? - The audio...

637
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:18,533
- was interrupted. - Take that plane and get lost.

638
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,104
(He suddenly tells him off.)

639
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:22,073
What was that all of a sudden?

640
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:23,374
Take that plane and get lost.

641
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:24,843
How dare you talk like that to your older brother?

642
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,467
What?

643
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,268
Wait, I didn't mean that.

644
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:30,283
(He panics.)

645
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:32,854
- It's not like that! I swear! - Hey!

646
00:20:32,855 --> 00:20:35,232
- It wasn't like that! - What have you done?

647
00:20:35,284 --> 00:20:37,184
It's not like that! I promise!

648
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:39,253
- No, no! It was an accident! - How dare you?

649
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:41,053
- What did you do? - I'm so sorry!

650
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,554
- How dare you? - I'm truly sorry.

651
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,293
- I'm sorry. - You punk!

652
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,993
- Watch out. - Okay, I'm sorry.

653
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,763
Are you three in some kind of super strength performance?

654
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:50,163
(He's curious.)

655
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,843
Jae Seok, you have no right to ask that in your attire.

656
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,944
(Haha doesn't understand him.)

657
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:57,503
- Come here. - You're so shameless.

658
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:58,644
Come here.

659
00:20:58,645 --> 00:20:59,944
(The super strength team is finally complete.)

660
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:01,097
He's so shameless.

661
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:02,712
With that attire?

662
00:21:02,814 --> 00:21:05,583
The first match you'll have with a hint on stake is...

663
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,656
Food Name Kung Kung Ta.

664
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,187
You'll take turns...

665
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:12,523
playing a three-syllable word chain.

666
00:21:12,524 --> 00:21:14,964
However, the final member...

667
00:21:14,965 --> 00:21:17,523
may only say the name of a dish.

668
00:21:17,524 --> 00:21:18,533
(They need to do two rounds.)

669
00:21:18,534 --> 00:21:20,434
The last member needs to do well.

670
00:21:20,435 --> 00:21:22,733
There is no syllable limit for that.

671
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:24,464
- There isn't? - Only for the final member.

672
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:25,533
- It's hard. - There is no limit?

673
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,615
- The fourth player is key. - Right.

674
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,021
This isn't about attacking each other. It's teamwork.

675
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,644
- Okay, we'll go first. - Why?

676
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:32,874
- After you. - We'll go first.

677
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:33,944
Does she go first?

678
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:35,883
You may not repeat the words.

679
00:21:36,145 --> 00:21:38,021
- What? We can't? - No, you can't.

680
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,654
I'm really terrible at word chains.

681
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,420
- I'm ruined. - Can we repeat them at least once?

682
00:21:42,224 --> 00:21:43,611
- We have Ji Hyo. - You can take your shoes off.

683
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:45,531
- Take them off. - Right, they have Seok Jin.

684
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:48,154
The number of dishes that I know...

685
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:50,364
- is over 30,000. - Okay!

686
00:21:50,365 --> 00:21:52,134
- Don't be ridiculous. - It'll be a piece of cake.

687
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,934
- He made this game. - Right.

688
00:21:54,935 --> 00:21:56,763
- He's the original creator. - It's been a long time.

689
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,233
- He's the original creator! - He made it.

690
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,173
Excuse me, but are you two married?

691
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:02,387
- Who? - Their colors look like our flag.

692
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:04,003
- What do you mean? - The colors.

693
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:07,105
- Aren't you content creators? - What do you mean?

694
00:22:07,314 --> 00:22:09,558
- How could you say that? - Aren't you on social networks?

695
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:12,026
- I think I'm right. - I'm a bar exam student.

696
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:13,313
They're on social networks.

697
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,813
Ji Hyo, you're first. Get ready.

698
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:16,023
Ready, set, go.

699
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:18,323
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

700
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:20,894
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

701
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:25,033
Say a dish at the end

702
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,063
(First syllable is "ko".)

703
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:28,084
Ko Hyun Jung.

704
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:30,164
(Ko Hyun Jung)

705
00:22:30,165 --> 00:22:32,246
Water purifier.

706
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:33,799
- That was so slow. - "Gi"?

707
00:22:33,974 --> 00:22:35,303
Train ticket.

708
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:36,303
Okay.

709
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,427
Pyo In Bong.

710
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:39,674
(What's wrong with the rhythm?)

711
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:42,439
(What are they doing?)

712
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:44,743
- Hold on. - Pyo In Bong.

713
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:46,284
- What is this? - Seriously? Hold on.

714
00:22:46,455 --> 00:22:47,783
It's too weird.

715
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,154
Why bother clapping?

716
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:51,226
- Why would you do this? - They're offbeat.

717
00:22:51,284 --> 00:22:52,621
- Why would you do this? - Come out!

718
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:54,223
- This won't do. Come out. - Come on.

719
00:22:54,224 --> 00:22:55,929
- You're so slow! - Come out.

720
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:57,793
- This isn't fair. - Why not?

721
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,263
- Come out! - That's too much.

722
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:01,733
- Everyone. - Hold on.

723
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,204
- Let us do one round. - Come on.

724
00:23:03,205 --> 00:23:05,033
- Let us do one round. - My gosh.

725
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:06,674
- Let us do one more round. - Let them go one more round.

726
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:07,833
We'll let you do it. Sorry.

727
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,144
- Let's do well, guys. - We can do it.

728
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:11,644
- I'm so disappointed. - Let's do well.

729
00:23:11,645 --> 00:23:13,614
- 1, 2, 3, let's go! - 1, 2, 3, let's go!

730
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:15,013
This is your last chance.

731
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:16,013
- Wait. - It's your last chance.

732
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:17,384
This time, we'll drag you out.

733
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,802
- Let's drag them out. - Ready, set, go.

734
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:22,583
- Kungs, Kungs, Kungs - It's too fast.

735
00:23:22,584 --> 00:23:25,424
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

736
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:28,627
Say a dish at the end

737
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:30,694
"Midopa".

738
00:23:30,695 --> 00:23:31,857
- What? Hold on. - My gosh.

739
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:34,033
(What?)

740
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:35,564
- What was that? - Wait.

741
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:37,864
- "Midopa"? - I can't take this any longer.

742
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:39,374
- This is just my style! - Why doesn't this count?

743
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,033
- I like it! - "Midopa"?

744
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,273
- It doesn't work. - "Midopa"?

745
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:44,590
- It's a department store. - Don't you know "midopa"?

746
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:46,348
- Right? - Come on.

747
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,277
Why doesn't it count?

748
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:50,283
- It works. - Let me explain.

749
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:52,114
- Midopa Department Store... - It existed before.

750
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:54,283
- was quite famous. - Right.

751
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:55,924
- It disappeared. - During the financial crisis,

752
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,983
- Right. - they merged with...

753
00:23:57,984 --> 00:23:59,454
- L department store. - Yes, it's no longer existing.

754
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,523
- It's gone. - Right.

755
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,664
- It's not in the dictionary. - It's not.

756
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:03,723
How sad is that?

757
00:24:03,724 --> 00:24:05,993
- It was in her memories. - Right.

758
00:24:05,994 --> 00:24:08,033
- She's sad it has disappeared. - Yes.

759
00:24:08,034 --> 00:24:09,964
- But the other team is against it. - Come on.

760
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:11,704
- We can't be any more lenient. - Come on.

761
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:13,134
- This is your final chance. - Just once more.

762
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,874
It's your final chance. Fine.

763
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,027
Ji Hyo.

764
00:24:16,474 --> 00:24:18,310
You really are old to have remembered that.

765
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:20,272
- She's very old. - You're right.

766
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:23,034
I'm sure people are wildly searching for "Midopa" right now.

767
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,483
- I know. - I was startled too.

768
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:26,219
- "Midopa"? - I didn't know I'd say that.

769
00:24:26,455 --> 00:24:28,454
If we fail this time, we'll acknowledge it.

770
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:30,884
- Let's drag them out this time. - This is already too weird.

771
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:31,924
- Ready, set, go. - Drag them away.

772
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,023
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

773
00:24:34,024 --> 00:24:36,424
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

774
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:38,945
Say a dish at the end

775
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,715
Yu Jae Seok.

776
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:43,333
- Seokguram. - That's good.

777
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:45,704
(Yu Jae Seok, Seokguram)

778
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,164
"Ambasa".

779
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,598
Photo studio.

780
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:52,645
(Jae Seok is the 5th player and needs to say a dish.)

781
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:55,344
Stir-fried "kwanchang".

782
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:56,743
- Hold on. - Okay.

783
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,614
(Stir-fried "kwanchang"?)

784
00:24:58,615 --> 00:24:59,753
That's tasty.

785
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:01,013
- It's very tasty. - That doesn't count.

786
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:03,553
(They can't take this any longer.)

787
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:05,523
- Come out. - Stir-fried "kwanchang"?

788
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,823
Did you mean "enema"?

789
00:25:06,824 --> 00:25:08,223
- "Kwanchang"? - I meant shellfish muscles.

790
00:25:08,695 --> 00:25:10,164
It's shellfish muscles!

791
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,964
- Stir-fried shellfish muscles! - Shellfish muscles!

792
00:25:11,965 --> 00:25:13,164
- Shellfish muscles! - What's "kwanchang"?

793
00:25:13,165 --> 00:25:14,434
What is that?

794
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:16,503
- What is that? - I meant shellfish muscles!

795
00:25:16,504 --> 00:25:17,704
That's enough!

796
00:25:17,705 --> 00:25:19,306
- What's "kwanchang"? - I won't tolerate this.

797
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:21,033
- I won't tolerate this any longer. - Come out.

798
00:25:21,034 --> 00:25:22,803
- It was shellfish muscles. - What was "kwanchang".

799
00:25:22,804 --> 00:25:25,043
- "Kwanchang"? - You meant shellfish muscles.

800
00:25:25,044 --> 00:25:27,013
- We can't be lenient. - That was hilarious.

801
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:29,344
How does stir-fried "kwanchang" taste?

802
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,543
Be quiet.

803
00:25:30,544 --> 00:25:31,813
(Haha's thinking of a new menu for his bbq restaurant.)

804
00:25:31,814 --> 00:25:33,483
- All right. - Ready, set, go.

805
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:37,424
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

806
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:40,354
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

807
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:43,426
Say a dish at the end

808
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,215
Macheon-dong.

809
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,855
Club.

810
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:48,386
"Imyunsoo".

811
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:50,104
- That doesn't work. - Marine products.

812
00:25:50,105 --> 00:25:51,156
Why not? "Imyunsoo".

813
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,233
(He mispronounces the word.)

814
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:54,533
- What's wrong with him? - It's "im".

815
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:56,074
It's "im".

816
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:58,006
- Come out. - Give us one more chance.

817
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:00,284
- Goodness. Give us one more chance. - It's "im".

818
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:01,702
Give us one more chance.

819
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:03,614
Hey, I think we should be more clear.

820
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:05,552
When you're saying a word,

821
00:26:05,715 --> 00:26:07,714
make sure you emphasize the last syllable.

822
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:09,424
- Be clear. - Emphasize the last syllable.

823
00:26:09,425 --> 00:26:11,159
- We're not bad at this game. - Right.

824
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:12,993
- We just can't hear well. - Right.

825
00:26:12,994 --> 00:26:14,753
- We know many words. - All right, let's go.

826
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:16,835
Ready, set, go.

827
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,194
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

828
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,194
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

829
00:26:21,195 --> 00:26:23,245
Say a dish at the end

830
00:26:24,004 --> 00:26:25,127
Fish.

831
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:26,494
Oil sauce.

832
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,844
Was that a "chang" or a "jang"?

833
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:30,043
- Hold on. - Come on.

834
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:31,503
(After being stuck,)

835
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:33,243
(he blames it on Se Chan.)

836
00:26:33,244 --> 00:26:34,644
Come on!

837
00:26:34,645 --> 00:26:36,276
- Of course, it's "oil sauce". - He wasn't clear.

838
00:26:36,715 --> 00:26:39,000
(They're wrong once again.)

839
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,384
(Good job!)

840
00:26:40,385 --> 00:26:41,742
Well done!

841
00:26:41,754 --> 00:26:43,354
(Seok Jin's emphasizing plan goes out the window.)

842
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,884
- Great job. - I'm so irritated.

843
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,023
- What's your problem? - No.

844
00:26:46,024 --> 00:26:48,064
Was that my fault? Was it?

845
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:50,293
- Jae Seok, am I to blame? - No.

846
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:51,897
What is this?

847
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,894
- Come on. - I said, "oil sauce".

848
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,333
So Min didn't play this game once.

849
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,864
- Poor So Min. - This is great.

850
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,803
- This is awesome. - He's the spy.

851
00:26:58,804 --> 00:27:00,374
- Everyone understood "oil sauce". - Seok Jin.

852
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,944
Aren't you the spy?

853
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,596
- He said, "chang". - He's the spy.

854
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:06,013
Don't be so obvious.

855
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:07,813
- Don't do that. - They can't pass three players.

856
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:08,866
All right.

857
00:27:08,984 --> 00:27:10,678
Let's succeed this time around. Okay!

858
00:27:10,814 --> 00:27:12,553
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

859
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,354
(Ji Hyo said, "gag".)

860
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:15,547
Oil sauce.

861
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:17,177
Crock.

862
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:18,647
Boss.

863
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:21,354
(If Jae Seok can say a dish that starts with "im",)

864
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,058
(they'll succeed one round.)

865
00:27:23,695 --> 00:27:25,194
Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

866
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:26,364
- What? - Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

867
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:27,493
(Im Su Yeon's fried rice?)

868
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:29,709
We talked about the "imyunsoo" once before!

869
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:32,874
(Jong Kook explodes.)

870
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,733
- My gosh. - Im Su Yeon's fried rice!

871
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:35,844
- This is... - Get out.

872
00:27:35,845 --> 00:27:37,344
- That doesn't exist. - Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

873
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,773
- Such a thing doesn't exist. - Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

874
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,174
- It's... - It's delicious.

875
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:41,614
- It does exist. - Drag them away!

876
00:27:41,615 --> 00:27:44,441
- It's a franchise. - Who is Im Su Yeon?

877
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:47,013
- I was... - Don't be ridiculous. Leave.

878
00:27:47,014 --> 00:27:49,553
- Get out. - I'll make you fried rice.

879
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:50,723
- He wants Im Su Yeon. - Goodness.

880
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:52,454
- He said Im Su Yeon. - He's so suspicious.

881
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:54,194
Such fried rice doesn't exist.

882
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:55,993
- Come on. - Hey, we were talking about...

883
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:57,563
- They're so mean. - Excuse me.

884
00:27:57,564 --> 00:28:01,594
- We were talking about it before. - Right.

885
00:28:01,595 --> 00:28:03,704
- He's looking at me as if... - He's friendly.

886
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:06,604
- he's looking at an opponent. - Why?

887
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:07,803
- That's how he looks right now. - Come on.

888
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:09,604
- Look at him. - You got it wrong last time.

889
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,944
Look it up.

890
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:13,596
He was boasting.

891
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,644
(20 minutes ago)

892
00:28:16,645 --> 00:28:20,123
(Jae Seok mentioned the "imyunsoo".)

893
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,783
- But now, look what he's saying. - I couldn't remember it.

894
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,184
- I even helped him out. - He's suspicious.

895
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,694
I chose "boss"...

896
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:27,454
- to make it easier... - Isn't he suspicious.

897
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,164
- for him. - He's suspicious.

898
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,664
- Goodness. - I'm sorry about that.

899
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,733
I promise to do better next time.

900
00:28:32,734 --> 00:28:33,894
Or can we switch places?

901
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,180
- Wait. - Why didn't you do that earlier?

902
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:37,733
(His team members suspect him.)

903
00:28:37,734 --> 00:28:39,503
- I still can't believe it. - Ready, set, go.

904
00:28:39,504 --> 00:28:42,104
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

905
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:44,828
Say a dish at the end

906
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,467
Bicycle.

907
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:48,513
Goose liver.

908
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:49,743
(Bicycle, goose liver)

909
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:50,836
Soy sauce bottle.

910
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:52,577
Log.

911
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:54,710
Salted radishes.

912
00:28:55,014 --> 00:28:57,154
(They finally succeed.)

913
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,753
(They have completed one round...)

914
00:28:58,754 --> 00:29:00,753
(despite being laughing stocks to their opponents.)

915
00:29:00,754 --> 00:29:02,122
Im Chang Jung.

916
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:03,547
Jeongbalsan.

917
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:05,189
The foot of a mountain.

918
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:06,956
A bear's foot.

919
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:10,503
(After much turmoil, it's Jong Kook's turn.)

920
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:13,360
(If he gets it right, Team Grandma will win.)

921
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:16,644
"Bal"...

922
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:18,674
(Wailing)

923
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:20,043
"Bal"...

924
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,360
(He runs out of time and fails.)

925
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:24,214
- I thought we'd lose. - "Bal"...

926
00:29:24,215 --> 00:29:26,283
- There's balsamic! - Balsamic!

927
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:27,714
- Balsamic! - Balsamic!

928
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:28,723
Balsamic!

929
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:30,783
- Balsamic! - Balsamic!

930
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,654
- Balsamic! - Balsamic!

931
00:29:32,655 --> 00:29:34,394
(Everyone mourns for balsamic.)

932
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:35,394
That was so close!

933
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,293
Can they say "goose liver" and "soy sauce bottle"?

934
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:38,763
"Foie gras" is goose liver.

935
00:29:38,764 --> 00:29:40,833
- Of course, we can. - We can?

936
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,104
- Okay, then. - Okay.

937
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:43,303
Let's say, "duck liver" too.

938
00:29:43,304 --> 00:29:44,604
- That works too. - All right.

939
00:29:44,605 --> 00:29:46,033
Say, "chicken's liver".

940
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,374
- That was close. - That doesn't work.

941
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,043
- "Cow's liver". - That doesn't work.

942
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,773
- Why not? - It doesn't work.

943
00:29:50,774 --> 00:29:51,803
Do "pig's liver". Do everything.

944
00:29:51,804 --> 00:29:52,813
How about "Seok Jin's liver"?

945
00:29:52,814 --> 00:29:55,644
- "Seok Jin's liver"? - Goodness.

946
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,783
- Do everything. - I thought we'd make it this time.

947
00:29:57,784 --> 00:29:59,110
It was so close.

948
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:00,812
- Let's keep the same order. - The same?

949
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,854
Can we neglect the dictionary...

950
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,483
as long as whatever we say counts?

951
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:06,723
Then you'll come up with so many strange words.

952
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:09,023
And I enjoy having Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

953
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,263
Why doesn't Im Su Yeon's fried rice work?

954
00:30:11,264 --> 00:30:12,894
Who is Im Su Yeon?

955
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:14,733
- Who is she? - Bring her here!

956
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:15,763
- Who is she? - Who is she?

957
00:30:15,764 --> 00:30:17,003
- Tell me. - She's a good cook.

958
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:18,003
Call her immediately.

959
00:30:18,004 --> 00:30:20,204
There are so many Im Su Yeons in this country...

960
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:21,303
- who make fried rice. - Exactly.

961
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:23,753
So why doesn't it make sense?

962
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:24,968
Who is she?

963
00:30:25,304 --> 00:30:26,703
Come on.

964
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:29,398
- This will cause a ruckus. - Right.

965
00:30:29,715 --> 00:30:30,813
- I'm sure it will. - Right.

966
00:30:30,814 --> 00:30:32,313
You should be prepared.

967
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,684
- Let's hurry. - Okay.

968
00:30:34,685 --> 00:30:36,983
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

969
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:39,575
Say a dish at the end

970
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:41,014
Bowleg.

971
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:42,487
Handcart.

972
00:30:42,994 --> 00:30:44,094
Car repair.

973
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:46,793
(Bowleg, handcart, car repair)

974
00:30:46,794 --> 00:30:47,833
Terminal.

975
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,904
(Bowleg, handcart, car repair, terminal)

976
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:51,634
(It's Jong Kook's turn once again.)

977
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:54,634
(Will he be able to come up with a dish name?)

978
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,727
Terminal.

979
00:30:56,574 --> 00:30:59,174
Grilled deodeok roots that are made on top of a board.

980
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:00,773
- Good. - It's so delicious.

981
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:03,013
(Grilled deodeok roots that are made on top of a board.)

982
00:31:03,014 --> 00:31:04,443
(Haha verifies its taste.)

983
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:05,783
- Darn it. - That doesn't count!

984
00:31:05,784 --> 00:31:06,783
Why?

985
00:31:06,784 --> 00:31:09,283
(What was that answer?)

986
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,454
(Why is it wrong?)

987
00:31:10,455 --> 00:31:11,983
- Why? - What was that?

988
00:31:11,984 --> 00:31:13,154
- Why? - We got it right, didn't we?

989
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:14,594
Grilled deodeok roots that are made

990
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:16,094
- on top of a board. - It's tasty!

991
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:17,293
- It's delicious. - Wait.

992
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:18,763
- Hold on. - This counts.

993
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,763
- You must cook it on a board. - It's much tastier.

994
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:22,744
What was all that about a board?

995
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:24,664
On top of a board?

996
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:26,204
(This lawyer is at a loss for words.)

997
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,174
- The board will burn. - No, it won't.

998
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:30,450
- Then how do you grill it? - The grilled deodeok roots...

999
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:33,313
were made on the board.

1000
00:31:33,314 --> 00:31:35,743
If that phrase comes up online, I'll acknowledge it.

1001
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:37,384
- My gosh. - Come on.

1002
00:31:37,385 --> 00:31:38,483
Why bother searching?

1003
00:31:38,484 --> 00:31:39,483
No.

1004
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:40,883
- I couldn't find any. - It doesn't make any sense.

1005
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:43,384
There is such a thing!

1006
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:44,915
They're so picky.

1007
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:47,239
We're not close-minded people.

1008
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:49,293
- It just doesn't make sense. - We have some leniency.

1009
00:31:49,294 --> 00:31:52,094
- Then how should we eat them? - You're being too strict.

1010
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,194
Goodness.

1011
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:54,664
You lack knowledge.

1012
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,604
Then I can say,

1013
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:59,124
"kimchi that's in my fridge".

1014
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:00,404
- Sure. - Go for it.

1015
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:01,833
- Say it! - Do it!

1016
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,273
- Do it! - Go for it!

1017
00:32:03,274 --> 00:32:04,644
- I said, do it! - Let's do it.

1018
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:06,743
- Do it! It must make sense. - Do it.

1019
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:08,013
- It needs to make sense. - Do it!

1020
00:32:08,014 --> 00:32:09,283
Our youngest sister will beat you all.

1021
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:10,614
You have to keep the rhythm.

1022
00:32:10,615 --> 00:32:12,797
- Don't worry about that. - If you stutter, you'll get hit.

1023
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,614
- Hold on. - If you stutter, you'll get hit.

1024
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:16,723
(Jong Kook threatens them.)

1025
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:17,723
What did you say?

1026
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,493
Why should we get hit for stuttering?

1027
00:32:19,494 --> 00:32:21,654
- We can't stutter? - You must enunciate well.

1028
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:22,924
- You can't say that. - Enunciate.

1029
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:24,164
Keep the rhythm.

1030
00:32:24,165 --> 00:32:25,993
I'll make the rules a bit easier.

1031
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,664
It just needs to make sense, and you need to make only one round.

1032
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:28,716
Okay.

1033
00:32:29,135 --> 00:32:30,364
(The staff makes it easier.)

1034
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,634
They made it so much easier.

1035
00:32:31,635 --> 00:32:33,033
We just need to make one round.

1036
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,033
- We can do it. - One round.

1037
00:32:34,034 --> 00:32:35,273
- Focus. - We can do it.

1038
00:32:35,274 --> 00:32:36,904
- All right. - Ready, set, go.

1039
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:39,013
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1040
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:41,013
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

1041
00:32:41,014 --> 00:32:43,840
Say a dish at the end

1042
00:32:44,514 --> 00:32:45,534
Corner of a room.

1043
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:47,275
Seokguram.

1044
00:32:47,784 --> 00:32:48,804
Amsa-dong.

1045
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:50,405
Club.

1046
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:53,394
(It's So Min's turn.)

1047
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:56,149
(Will she overcome this pressure and succeed?)

1048
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,727
(The fourth word is "club".)

1049
00:32:58,965 --> 00:33:01,493
"Riyeokguk". I mean seaweed soup.

1050
00:33:01,494 --> 00:33:03,606
- It's seaweed soup. - Darn it.

1051
00:33:04,734 --> 00:33:05,733
- What? - It's seaweed soup.

1052
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,374
(What is "Riyeokguk"?)

1053
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:09,204
Nothing starts with "ri".

1054
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:11,204
- Why would you say that? - Of course, there are.

1055
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:13,153
"A hotdog with a ribbon".

1056
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:14,334
Good.

1057
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,813
- Good job. - "A hotdog with a ribbon".

1058
00:33:15,814 --> 00:33:18,396
- "Hotdog from Lisbon". - There are many, So Min.

1059
00:33:18,514 --> 00:33:20,214
Don't you dare sit there again.

1060
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,253
- There's handcart. - What?

1061
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:22,553
Don't you dare sit there again.

1062
00:33:22,554 --> 00:33:24,184
(So Min bursts.)

1063
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:25,694
- She was wrong only once. - There's handcart.

1064
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:26,793
- Don't you sit there. - Right.

1065
00:33:26,794 --> 00:33:28,293
What are you saying?

1066
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:29,394
- Seok Jin. - There's handcart.

1067
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:30,594
I only played once so far.

1068
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:31,694
She only got it wrong once.

1069
00:33:31,695 --> 00:33:33,364
- This was her first time playing. - I only played once.

1070
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:34,394
- It was just once. - Hey.

1071
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:35,763
He's so coldhearted towards her.

1072
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,763
I haven't seen him in a while.

1073
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,499
"Don't you dare sit there."

1074
00:33:38,504 --> 00:33:40,413
She only played once.

1075
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,773
- My gosh. - Isn't he so brazen?

1076
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:45,355
- My goodness. - Goodness.

1077
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:46,743
(This is an obnoxious game.)

1078
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:47,773
Let's win this time.

1079
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:49,483
- Okay. - Let's succeed. Ready, set, go.

1080
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:52,371
Say a dish at the end

1081
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:53,834
Mountaintop.

1082
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:55,304
Lee Bong Won.

1083
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:56,947
Director.

1084
00:33:57,554 --> 00:33:58,605
Atka mackerel.

1085
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:02,154
(It's Jae Seok's turn to finish it.)

1086
00:34:02,155 --> 00:34:03,793
(Will he make up for the past humiliation?)

1087
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,528
I think they'll succeed this time.

1088
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:08,227
(The fourth word is "atka mackerel.)

1089
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:09,555
Tap water.

1090
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:11,764
- That's food too. - Why not?

1091
00:34:11,765 --> 00:34:13,233
(He confidently says his answer.)

1092
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:14,773
(Why are we wrong?)

1093
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,174
- That's not food. - That doesn't count.

1094
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:17,474
- How is tap water food? - It's food.

1095
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,114
- It's not food. - This isn't right.

1096
00:34:19,115 --> 00:34:21,214
- Tap water doesn't count. - No, it works.

1097
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:23,683
You could've said, "ramyeon I had at the swimming pool".

1098
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,313
- You had many choices. - I was hungry back then!

1099
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,884
(He suddenly barges in.)

1100
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,824
(Do you know what I've gone through?)

1101
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:31,253
- Yes! - I was tormented by hunger!

1102
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,293
- Hey, I was... - I sated my hunger with tap water!

1103
00:34:33,294 --> 00:34:34,994
- Come on. - Hey.

1104
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,594
- When we were hungry, - I invited you over.

1105
00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:38,094
- we drank tap water! - It was like home for me!

1106
00:34:38,095 --> 00:34:39,764
- Im Su Yeon! - I did.

1107
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:41,094
Did you drink tap water then?

1108
00:34:41,095 --> 00:34:42,404
What do you expect us to eat then?

1109
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,003
- Still... - Come on.

1110
00:34:44,004 --> 00:34:45,674
You didn't allow us to have Im Su Yeon's fried rice either.

1111
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:47,404
- When we were young, - We can't even have...

1112
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:48,660
- grilled deodeok roots. - we were starving.

1113
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:50,003
- That's why we chose tap water! - We were so hungry.

1114
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,273
We would fill up our stomachs with tap water.

1115
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:54,514
- You're pushing it with this one. - Then what will you allow?

1116
00:34:54,515 --> 00:34:56,284
Come on. There are many.

1117
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,483
- What? - Tell us.

1118
00:34:57,484 --> 00:34:58,913
- Sujebi. - Handmade noodles.

1119
00:34:58,914 --> 00:35:00,925
- Handmade jajangmyeon. - Sujebi.

1120
00:35:01,285 --> 00:35:03,222
- There are many. - You're right.

1121
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:06,148
- Fine, let's pull out. - Okay.

1122
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:08,257
- I accept that. - Do you?

1123
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,764
- Do you? - Why would you say tap water?

1124
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:12,793
Aren't we so terrible?

1125
00:35:12,794 --> 00:35:13,793
You're the worst.

1126
00:35:13,794 --> 00:35:15,594
- I know. - This will never end.

1127
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:18,503
- The sun's going down. - Look at the sky.

1128
00:35:18,504 --> 00:35:20,003
Let's just go one round.

1129
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:22,146
They even made it easier for us.

1130
00:35:23,374 --> 00:35:25,174
- Okay. Be serious. - Ready, set, go.

1131
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:26,174
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1132
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:28,562
Say a dish at the end

1133
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:31,413
- "Yogiyo". - Chef.

1134
00:35:31,414 --> 00:35:32,654
(What?)

1135
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:33,705
Is that allowed?

1136
00:35:34,084 --> 00:35:35,104
Photo studio.

1137
00:35:35,484 --> 00:35:36,504
Wardrobe.

1138
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:39,353
(Seok Jin needs to complete the round.)

1139
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,194
(You just need to say a dish.)

1140
00:35:41,195 --> 00:35:42,253
Is that allowed?

1141
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:44,437
(Will Seok Jin, who's been making mistakes all day, succeed?)

1142
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:46,364
Stir-fried beef tripe with rice.

1143
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,710
(He enunciates clearly.)

1144
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,655
(Team Grandpa wins.)

1145
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:53,738
(It's finally over!)

1146
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:55,674
Wait a minute.

1147
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,103
Does "Yogiyo" work?

1148
00:35:57,104 --> 00:35:58,904
- That shouldn't count. - Does it work?

1149
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,844
- We did it! - Excuse me, it doesn't count.

1150
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:02,014
It means "here".

1151
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:03,384
- It doesn't work. - Why not?

1152
00:36:03,385 --> 00:36:04,543
- That's not it. - You can't do that.

1153
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,384
- "Where? 'Yogiyo'." - Then Im Su Yeon's fried rice...

1154
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:07,413
- should be right as well. - Right.

1155
00:36:07,414 --> 00:36:08,884
- You should count that right. - Yes.

1156
00:36:08,885 --> 00:36:09,924
No, no.

1157
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:11,154
- "Which way do I go?" - "Yogiyo".

1158
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:12,994
- "Yogiyo"! - That doesn't count.

1159
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,523
- You should give us credit too. - Go to your seat while we talk.

1160
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:16,264
- Okay. - If not, give us another chance.

1161
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:17,754
- We'll try again. - "Yogiyo".

1162
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:18,994
It doesn't count.

1163
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:20,833
We'll go again then.

1164
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,094
- We'll go again. - We can allow that.

1165
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:23,764
They'll do it over again, so let's pull out.

1166
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,034
- They'll do it again. - All right, we'll pull out.

1167
00:36:25,035 --> 00:36:27,003
Okay. Let's pull out.

1168
00:36:27,004 --> 00:36:29,804
(After successfully threatening them, they pull out.)

1169
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:30,944
- Hold on a minute. - Okay.

1170
00:36:30,945 --> 00:36:33,014
- What was that? - What was that?

1171
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:34,313
You can't say brand names.

1172
00:36:34,314 --> 00:36:36,014
- We're not being sponsored. - No brand names.

1173
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:37,583
- We didn't know. - We didn't.

1174
00:36:37,584 --> 00:36:38,913
Se Chan, it was you, right?

1175
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:40,313
- Yes. - You're suspicious.

1176
00:36:40,584 --> 00:36:41,983
We'll do it once again.

1177
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:43,077
Let's go.

1178
00:36:43,184 --> 00:36:45,824
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1179
00:36:45,825 --> 00:36:47,924
Kung, Kung, Ta, Kung, Kung, Ta

1180
00:36:47,925 --> 00:36:50,241
Say a dish at the end

1181
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:51,764
J ramyeon.

1182
00:36:51,765 --> 00:36:52,957
(He says a brand name.)

1183
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:55,165
- Hey. - Darn it.

1184
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,003
(J ramyeon)

1185
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:58,034
- Hold on. - Darn it.

1186
00:36:58,035 --> 00:36:59,474
- Are you kidding me? - Darn it.

1187
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:00,800
(They explode.)

1188
00:37:01,274 --> 00:37:03,404
- Hey! - How dare you?

1189
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:05,304
- Hey, you! - You can't say that!

1190
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,913
- No, wait. - My gosh.

1191
00:37:06,914 --> 00:37:09,114
Since I'm banned to say brand names,

1192
00:37:09,115 --> 00:37:10,384
- that's the only thing I think of. - I quit.

1193
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:12,554
- I can't think of anything else. - I quit. Consider me out.

1194
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:13,813
- That little... - This time...

1195
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,068
I can't stop thinking about brand names.

1196
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:18,583
Hey! You could've said Jindo dog or Qin Shi Huang.

1197
00:37:18,584 --> 00:37:20,554
- There are so many. - But that's all I could think of.

1198
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:21,921
I understand.

1199
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:23,685
I'm sorry.

1200
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:24,824
Let's succeed this time around.

1201
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,089
- Okay. - Let's go.

1202
00:37:26,164 --> 00:37:27,393
- Get ready. - I desperately want to win.

1203
00:37:27,394 --> 00:37:28,893
Ready, set, go.

1204
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,603
Kungs, Kungs, Kungs

1205
00:37:31,604 --> 00:37:34,273
Say a dish at the end

1206
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:35,273
(Don't say a brand name.)

1207
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:36,404
Shoe rack.

1208
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:40,014
(Shoe rack)

1209
00:37:40,015 --> 00:37:41,299
Jean Valjean.

1210
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,066
Soy sauce braised beef.

1211
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:44,867
Atka mackerel.

1212
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:48,747
(Jae Seok, who's filled his stomach with tap water, is next.)

1213
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:51,812
(Will he come up with a word that makes sense?)

1214
00:37:52,385 --> 00:37:54,567
(It's the same syllable.)

1215
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:55,846
Sujebi.

1216
00:37:56,394 --> 00:37:57,721
We did it!

1217
00:37:57,894 --> 00:38:00,994
(Team Grandma is the final winner.)

1218
00:38:00,995 --> 00:38:03,103
- It's over. - We did it.

1219
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:04,333
- We did it. - We did it.

1220
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:06,833
What is this?

1221
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:08,333
(What is this?)

1222
00:38:08,334 --> 00:38:09,344
Success!

1223
00:38:09,345 --> 00:38:11,474
- Okay. - Yes!

1224
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:13,074
- And now... - Good job.

1225
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:15,359
Team Grandma has won.

1226
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:16,744
Our team has no fake ones.

1227
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,083
- We all worked so hard. - We all worked so hard.

1228
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:20,564
- You'll be given hints about fakes. - Okay.

1229
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:22,183
Grandma can choose...

1230
00:38:22,184 --> 00:38:25,316
- a grandchild to look at the hint. - Okay.

1231
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:28,194
Grandma, I tried my best.

1232
00:38:28,195 --> 00:38:29,494
- You saw me. - You saw me do it.

1233
00:38:29,495 --> 00:38:31,094
You know how hard I tried.

1234
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:33,034
- You saw me. - I worked hard.

1235
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:35,333
- I'm certain. - You saw it right next to me.

1236
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,103
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1237
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:39,163
- Rock-paper-scissors. - That's the worst game to play.

1238
00:38:39,164 --> 00:38:40,333
Let's do it.

1239
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:41,528
(I can't choose.)

1240
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:42,798
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1241
00:38:43,004 --> 00:38:44,203
(Ji Hyo has lost.)

1242
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:46,114
But you have to share the hint with me.

1243
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,909
- Okay. - Share with me.

1244
00:38:47,914 --> 00:38:50,143
When you choose the same one with Grandma, you win. How's that sound?

1245
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,344
- That sounds fun. - All right?

1246
00:38:52,345 --> 00:38:53,844
- Let's try something new. - Okay.

1247
00:38:53,885 --> 00:38:55,079
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1248
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:57,666
(Haha has chosen "rock" which is the same as Grandma.)

1249
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:59,494
(The hint about the 3 fakes goes to Haha.)

1250
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:01,330
He's a bad choice.

1251
00:39:01,495 --> 00:39:03,403
- He's not a good choice. - Trust me!

1252
00:39:03,465 --> 00:39:05,393
- I tried really hard. - Share it with me.

1253
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:06,594
Yes. I'll tell you no matter what.

1254
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,433
- I don't think Haha is a fake one. - Haha, I know you tried.

1255
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:09,534
He did well.

1256
00:39:09,535 --> 00:39:11,103
I worked really hard.

1257
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,451
I'm the one who pushed through Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

1258
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,003
"Do not show anyone else."

1259
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:16,828
After all,

1260
00:39:17,644 --> 00:39:19,031
we're on the same team.

1261
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,136
Can't we see it together?

1262
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:22,378
- No. - I can't trust anyone.

1263
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:24,708
That seems too vague.

1264
00:39:24,814 --> 00:39:28,614
("Fakes are 2 men and 1 woman.")

1265
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:31,224
(Seok Jin, Jong Kook, and Jae Seok count as women in this race.)

1266
00:39:31,225 --> 00:39:33,694
(And So Min counts as a man.)

1267
00:39:33,695 --> 00:39:35,253
That's it for Round One's hint.

1268
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:37,030
- We'll move on to Round Two. - Okay.

1269
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:40,321
(Who are the 3 fakes that are hiding their identities?)

1270
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:42,333
Our team lost the spirit.

1271
00:39:42,334 --> 00:39:44,003
- We can do it. - Don't worry.

1272
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:46,015
This mission is...

1273
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,503
Mysterious Vocabulary.

1274
00:39:47,504 --> 00:39:48,759
- Okay. - What's that?

1275
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:50,974
Both teams will take turns and the winning team...

1276
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:52,344
will have the two-syllable open ticket...

1277
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:53,905
the priority to say the answer.

1278
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,344
After opening the two letters,

1279
00:39:55,345 --> 00:39:57,385
the winning team will guess the related letters.

1280
00:39:57,414 --> 00:40:00,108
When they get it wrong, the chance is passed on to the other team.

1281
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:02,054
The team that gets the two questions right first will win.

1282
00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:03,284
(The chance is passed on when one says the wrong answer,)

1283
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:04,483
(and they will play the best of 3 games.)

1284
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:06,194
Okay. It doesn't sound that hard.

1285
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,684
Your mission is...

1286
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:09,623
to find the bottle cap in the cups.

1287
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:11,227
(Find the bottle cap in the cups)

1288
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:12,864
Each representative will sit down,

1289
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:14,764
and hide the bottle cap among three cups.

1290
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:16,163
(The game will start by hiding the bottle cap in 1 of the 3 cups.)

1291
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,003
They will then shuffle the cups for 30 seconds,

1292
00:40:18,004 --> 00:40:19,912
ask each other questions, and answer.

1293
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,433
After 30 seconds,

1294
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:23,344
if you find the cup with the bottle cap,

1295
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:24,773
you'll get the 2-syllable open ticket...

1296
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:25,969
and the priority to say the answer.

1297
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:27,910
Okay.

1298
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,583
And if you either don't ask a question on your turn,

1299
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:31,884
or don't answer the question,

1300
00:40:31,885 --> 00:40:33,983
you will be hit by a toy hammer by the opponent.

1301
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:35,587
- That will make you blink. - That is bad.

1302
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,114
- We have to ask questions. - Representatives.

1303
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:38,378
Please come out.

1304
00:40:38,425 --> 00:40:40,566
Can our two members with the bright hair do it?

1305
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:41,724
- Me and... - Yes, let's do that.

1306
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:42,724
You have to win this.

1307
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,563
- Seok Jin. - It's pink versus yellow.

1308
00:40:44,564 --> 00:40:46,370
Who will hit with the toy hammer?

1309
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,194
Jong Kook can do that.

1310
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,603
Oh, no. Please.

1311
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:51,298
(Jong Kook can do that.)

1312
00:40:52,135 --> 00:40:53,174
(His pupils are dilated.)

1313
00:40:53,175 --> 00:40:55,316
- You can't do that. - Right. He's going to get hurt.

1314
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:56,844
I'll go easy on you.

1315
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:58,537
I'll avoid hitting the critical area.

1316
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,451
- Hit hard so that he can blink. - He's going to get hurt.

1317
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:02,614
But we're still on the same team after all.

1318
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:03,972
- Right. - So I'll go easy.

1319
00:41:04,115 --> 00:41:06,953
Choose a cup to put your bottle cap in.

1320
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:08,209
I can't wait to see this.

1321
00:41:08,314 --> 00:41:09,313
Okay.

1322
00:41:09,314 --> 00:41:10,447
(They both choose a cup.)

1323
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,006
Set, go.

1324
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:14,824
How much money do you have in your bank account?

1325
00:41:15,294 --> 00:41:16,549
Me? 2.8 million dollars.

1326
00:41:17,925 --> 00:41:19,046
Oh, boy.

1327
00:41:19,164 --> 00:41:20,317
Wait.

1328
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,974
(One of his cups falls.)

1329
00:41:23,635 --> 00:41:25,364
(He shows where the bottle cap is.)

1330
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:26,674
Were you surprised?

1331
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:28,203
He can't tell whether I'm lying or not.

1332
00:41:28,204 --> 00:41:29,357
- Right. - Ask him a question.

1333
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:30,603
What did you eat yesterday?

1334
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:32,278
Me? I ate jjamppong.

1335
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:33,539
- Jjamppong? - Jjamppong.

1336
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:34,942
Jjajangmyeon is better.

1337
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,614
What are you talking about?

1338
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:38,543
(Is Jae Seok giving advice?)

1339
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:39,637
What are you talking about?

1340
00:41:40,155 --> 00:41:41,990
Is this a comic talk?

1341
00:41:42,184 --> 00:41:45,183
- You have to ask him questions! - He's just being mean.

1342
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,378
Okay.

1343
00:41:46,394 --> 00:41:47,547
Do you...

1344
00:41:48,124 --> 00:41:49,379
have a girlfriend?

1345
00:41:50,394 --> 00:41:51,588
I do not.

1346
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:53,502
- Do you have one, don't you? - I don't.

1347
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,677
Of course, I don't.

1348
00:41:55,695 --> 00:41:57,602
- Hey! - I don't have a girlfriend.

1349
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:00,373
- I don't have a girlfriend. - What are you doing?

1350
00:42:00,374 --> 00:42:01,503
(He's trying to get a grip.)

1351
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:02,844
(Seok Jin shows where the bottle cap is.)

1352
00:42:02,845 --> 00:42:04,334
- I don't have one. - There's your bottle cap.

1353
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:06,597
There's your bottle cap.

1354
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:09,913
- Why did you blow it just now? - It was the last question.

1355
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:11,114
The last question is important.

1356
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:13,313
- He just showed him. - What did you do?

1357
00:42:13,314 --> 00:42:15,353
- You can't blow the whistle now. - What did you do?

1358
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:16,753
It was a simple mistake.

1359
00:42:16,754 --> 00:42:19,275
Choose who will guess first with rock-paper-scissors.

1360
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:20,547
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1361
00:42:20,595 --> 00:42:21,793
(Seok Jin wins.)

1362
00:42:21,794 --> 00:42:22,893
I won.

1363
00:42:22,894 --> 00:42:24,163
I have to guess the right one.

1364
00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:25,827
- We should do rock-paper-scissors. - You still...

1365
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:27,087
You have a good chance to win this.

1366
00:42:27,234 --> 00:42:28,417
Use your instincts.

1367
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:30,433
- This one? - This one.

1368
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:32,103
(Seok Jin chooses the cup in the middle.)

1369
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:33,197
The one in the middle.

1370
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,034
(The winner of this round gets to attack first in the actual game,)

1371
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,674
(win the 2-syllable open ticket and the priority to say the answer.)

1372
00:42:36,675 --> 00:42:38,848
(Would he have picked the right one?)

1373
00:42:39,204 --> 00:42:41,561
(It's empty.)

1374
00:42:42,475 --> 00:42:45,183
(Seok Jin fails in guessing where the bottle cap is.)

1375
00:42:45,184 --> 00:42:46,853
- That was close. - I knew it.

1376
00:42:46,854 --> 00:42:47,884
(Now it's Jae Seok's turn.)

1377
00:42:47,885 --> 00:42:49,038
Where is it?

1378
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:56,010
(You saw exactly it was going in the cup in the middle.)

1379
00:42:56,225 --> 00:42:57,293
This one.

1380
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:58,793
(What?)

1381
00:42:58,794 --> 00:43:00,121
- What? - That's not it.

1382
00:43:00,635 --> 00:43:03,804
(Jae Seok chooses the right one which does not have the bottle cap.)

1383
00:43:03,805 --> 00:43:05,663
(Jae Seok fails in guessing where the bottle cap is.)

1384
00:43:05,664 --> 00:43:06,873
- Who are you? - Who are you?

1385
00:43:06,874 --> 00:43:08,103
What did he do?

1386
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:10,625
- What did you do? - What's going on with you?

1387
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:12,404
(Did he compromise the mission on purpose?)

1388
00:43:12,405 --> 00:43:13,844
- I'm suspicious of him. - What did you do?

1389
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:14,967
I'm suspicious of him.

1390
00:43:15,144 --> 00:43:16,384
- What did you do? - What was that?

1391
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,444
- Seriously. - Why did you...

1392
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,219
- This does not make sense. - What was that?

1393
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,183
- It was so obvious. - Really.

1394
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:22,813
- It's my turn. - Right.

1395
00:43:22,814 --> 00:43:23,977
- I think he's on our team. - Right.

1396
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:27,353
This one.

1397
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,813
(Will he guess the right one this time?)

1398
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:31,527
(It's empty.)

1399
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:34,163
- It's not in there. - He chose the middle one before.

1400
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:35,864
It's either this one or that one.

1401
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,163
- I'm confused. - This one...

1402
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:38,287
or that one.

1403
00:43:38,405 --> 00:43:41,174
(He has the second chance after acting suspicious.)

1404
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,944
(Will he guess the right one this time?)

1405
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:44,344
- This one. - Yes.

1406
00:43:44,345 --> 00:43:46,674
(He has found it.)

1407
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:47,674
(Jae Seok wins the two rewards.)

1408
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,991
He was acting so weird, though.

1409
00:43:50,015 --> 00:43:51,043
I mean...

1410
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:52,714
if all of you keep acting weird,

1411
00:43:52,715 --> 00:43:54,154
- we can't find the fakes. - You were so weird.

1412
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:55,284
I actually thought this was the one.

1413
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:56,884
- He's acting so weird. - I really didn't know.

1414
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,099
- He did it on purpose. - I didn't know.

1415
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:01,154
- Do I have to guess the two words? - Right.

1416
00:44:01,155 --> 00:44:03,032
If we make a mistake,

1417
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:05,094
the other team can get a chance too.

1418
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:06,464
We might get this one.

1419
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:08,128
You can't tell by one letter.

1420
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:09,904
- Number 1 and 6? - Yes.

1421
00:44:09,905 --> 00:44:11,394
Number 1 and 6.

1422
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:12,904
I choose number 1 and 6.

1423
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:14,904
- Why? - I have to guess two.

1424
00:44:14,905 --> 00:44:16,609
Number 1 and 6.

1425
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,511
- "Gye"? - "Gye"?

1426
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,297
- I think I got it. - I think I got it.

1427
00:44:22,215 --> 00:44:23,307
First...

1428
00:44:23,515 --> 00:44:24,944
This one's difficult.

1429
00:44:24,945 --> 00:44:26,983
(Which two words start with "Lee" and end with "Gye"?)

1430
00:44:26,984 --> 00:44:28,689
- It's your turn. - "Lee" and "Gye"?

1431
00:44:28,954 --> 00:44:32,729
- It's Lee Gye In. - Lee Gye In.

1432
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:34,834
- It ends with "Gye", you idiot! - Lee Gye In?

1433
00:44:34,854 --> 00:44:36,660
How is that Lee Gye In?

1434
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:39,304
It starts with "Lee" and ends with "Gye".

1435
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:40,393
(Sighs)

1436
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:41,634
Come on.

1437
00:44:41,635 --> 00:44:43,003
That's not how you play this.

1438
00:44:43,004 --> 00:44:44,871
- He was trying to be funny. - It's not Lee Gye In.

1439
00:44:44,905 --> 00:44:46,833
- I can't guess with just two words. - You have 10 seconds.

1440
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:48,034
It's "Ogolgye" and something else.

1441
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:49,404
"Ogolgye".

1442
00:44:49,405 --> 00:44:50,974
- I think it's "Ogolgye". - "Ogolgye"?

1443
00:44:50,975 --> 00:44:52,804
Which related word starts with "Lee"?

1444
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:53,968
The bottom one is "Ogolgye".

1445
00:44:54,814 --> 00:44:56,844
(I got it.)

1446
00:44:56,845 --> 00:44:58,007
- The bottom one is "Ogolgye". - Four,

1447
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,753
- three... - Lee Byung Hun.

1448
00:44:59,754 --> 00:45:02,570
(Lee Byung Hun and the movie "New World".)

1449
00:45:02,885 --> 00:45:04,023
She's right.

1450
00:45:04,024 --> 00:45:06,724
(Was Lee Byung Hun in "New World"?)

1451
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:09,275
- He wasn't in that movie. - He wasn't in that movie.

1452
00:45:09,325 --> 00:45:10,447
He wasn't?

1453
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:11,994
- It's Lee Jung Jae! - It's Lee Jung Jae!

1454
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,034
(It was Lee Jung Jae.)

1455
00:45:13,035 --> 00:45:15,717
I played in "New World".

1456
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:18,034
Lee Kwang Soo and "Ogolgye"!

1457
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:19,773
- Lee Kwang Soo and "Ogolgye"? - "Ogolgye".

1458
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:20,773
How am I related to "Ogolgye"?

1459
00:45:20,774 --> 00:45:22,074
Let me answer!

1460
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:23,304
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1461
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:24,904
- Lee Jung Jae and "New World". - And "New World".

1462
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:28,643
(Team Grandma: Lee Jung Jae and "New World".)

1463
00:45:28,644 --> 00:45:31,235
I never imagined it would be "New World".

1464
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:33,083
Let's move on to the next one.

1465
00:45:33,084 --> 00:45:34,183
Se Chan, you go.

1466
00:45:34,184 --> 00:45:35,204
Let's go, Se Chan.

1467
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:37,983
(Ji Hyo from Team Grandma versus Se Chan from Team Grandpa)

1468
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:39,555
Set, go.

1469
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,324
Are you going to send a coffee truck for Kwang Soo?

1470
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:44,099
No way.

1471
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:46,393
Did you feel good after sending a coffee truck for So Min?

1472
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:48,608
- I loved it. - Didn't you think of me?

1473
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:49,964
Not at all.

1474
00:45:49,965 --> 00:45:51,025
You asked two questions.

1475
00:45:53,175 --> 00:45:54,255
Ask him a question.

1476
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,333
I'm sorry.

1477
00:45:55,334 --> 00:45:56,835
- Are you okay? - You...

1478
00:45:57,345 --> 00:45:58,674
- Are you okay? - Did you...

1479
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,244
(You didn't ask a question and you didn't send me a coffee truck.)

1480
00:46:00,245 --> 00:46:01,413
Did you and So Min...

1481
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:02,474
Kwang Soo.

1482
00:46:02,475 --> 00:46:04,344
(This is getting personal.)

1483
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,539
Buy some time.

1484
00:46:06,084 --> 00:46:07,177
Buy some time.

1485
00:46:07,354 --> 00:46:08,507
Okay, that's it.

1486
00:46:09,015 --> 00:46:10,324
(One is happy while the other is sad.)

1487
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:11,853
- Kwang Soo... - Wake up.

1488
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:12,983
(This is because of Kwang Soo's personal feelings.)

1489
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:14,454
What does Jun Ho have that I don't?

1490
00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:17,123
What do you see in Hong Jong Hyun?

1491
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:19,002
(He got the coffee truck gift.)

1492
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:21,034
I drink five cups of coffee in a day.

1493
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:22,433
(Do you know how much I like coffee?)

1494
00:46:22,434 --> 00:46:23,526
She's going to send you one.

1495
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:24,625
Let's win this.

1496
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:26,163
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1497
00:46:26,164 --> 00:46:27,174
Okay.

1498
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:28,225
The middle one.

1499
00:46:28,704 --> 00:46:30,074
(The winner gets the 2-syllable open ticket...)

1500
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:31,432
(and the priority to say the answer.)

1501
00:46:31,544 --> 00:46:33,574
(Did Se Chan see where the bottle cap went?)

1502
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:35,014
- Okay! - You did it.

1503
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:37,014
(The bottle cap was in there.)

1504
00:46:37,015 --> 00:46:38,614
- That's my Se Chan. - You got it at once.

1505
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:39,683
- Let's go. - At once.

1506
00:46:39,684 --> 00:46:41,983
- You're not getting the answer. - Se Chan did it.

1507
00:46:41,984 --> 00:46:43,623
- How about number 4 and 8? - The last letters?

1508
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:45,011
- 4 and 8, let's get this. - 4 and 8.

1509
00:46:45,055 --> 00:46:46,177
Se Chan!

1510
00:46:47,524 --> 00:46:49,453
"Saek" and "Gae"?

1511
00:46:49,454 --> 00:46:51,264
- "Saek" and "Gae." - Number 4 and 8 is...

1512
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:52,694
- difficult to guess. - It's difficult.

1513
00:46:52,695 --> 00:46:54,326
(What would the words be?)

1514
00:46:54,865 --> 00:46:56,700
"A Better Tomorrow".

1515
00:46:57,035 --> 00:46:58,331
It's "A Better Tomorrow".

1516
00:46:58,905 --> 00:46:59,974
Isn't it?

1517
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:01,634
(If the top word is "A Better Tomorrow"...)

1518
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:02,833
No?

1519
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,703
(What would the bottom word be?)

1520
00:47:04,704 --> 00:47:05,873
Let me answer!

1521
00:47:05,874 --> 00:47:07,242
(Let me answer!)

1522
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:09,999
(He tries to answer right after he heard "A Better Tomorrow".)

1523
00:47:10,084 --> 00:47:11,143
(What would his answer be?)

1524
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,344
"A Better Tomorrow"...

1525
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:13,753
"A Better Tomorrow",

1526
00:47:13,754 --> 00:47:14,813
and "Toothpick".

1527
00:47:14,814 --> 00:47:16,523
Kwang Soo!

1528
00:47:16,524 --> 00:47:17,523
Correct.

1529
00:47:17,524 --> 00:47:20,953
("A Better Tomorrow" and "Toothpick" are correct.)

1530
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:22,831
So Min, we did it!

1531
00:47:22,894 --> 00:47:24,252
- Wow. - Kwang Soo.

1532
00:47:24,564 --> 00:47:25,793
That was...

1533
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:27,333
You weren't the spy after all.

1534
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:28,589
How did he do that?

1535
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,503
He did great.

1536
00:47:30,504 --> 00:47:32,003
Let's move on to the last one.

1537
00:47:32,004 --> 00:47:33,463
- Okay. - So Min, you go.

1538
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:34,956
It's So Min's turn.

1539
00:47:35,274 --> 00:47:36,733
- How did he guess that? - And Soo Hyang.

1540
00:47:37,504 --> 00:47:38,944
Right here?

1541
00:47:38,945 --> 00:47:40,413
(Hide your bottle caps.)

1542
00:47:40,414 --> 00:47:41,976
Set, go.

1543
00:47:43,144 --> 00:47:44,313
You have a boyfriend, don't you?

1544
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:45,844
I don't. Do you?

1545
00:47:46,015 --> 00:47:47,214
I don't either.

1546
00:47:47,215 --> 00:47:48,514
Do you like Sang Yeob?

1547
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:49,884
I don't like him.

1548
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:52,183
(She sounds firm.)

1549
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:54,924
- You just got dumped. - I'm always being dumped.

1550
00:47:54,925 --> 00:47:56,221
Do you like Sang Yeob?

1551
00:47:56,254 --> 00:47:57,464
I have absolutely no interest.

1552
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:58,623
(She sounds solid as a rock.)

1553
00:47:58,624 --> 00:48:01,490
- He got dumped twice. - That was a good one, Soo Hyang.

1554
00:48:01,595 --> 00:48:03,441
- Will you date him if he asks you? - No.

1555
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,404
- How about you? - Me, neither.

1556
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:06,804
(It has turned into a Sang Yeob dumping competition.)

1557
00:48:06,805 --> 00:48:08,634
- When you were shooting the drama, - Yes?

1558
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,974
did you ever have feelings for him?

1559
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:11,065
No.

1560
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,103
Okay. That's enough.

1561
00:48:13,104 --> 00:48:15,174
This hurts too much for me!

1562
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:17,844
(This hurts too much for me!)

1563
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:20,014
- Don't worry. - It's just a game.

1564
00:48:20,015 --> 00:48:22,253
- They're just talking nonsense. - It's just a game.

1565
00:48:22,254 --> 00:48:23,583
It's not the truth.

1566
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,554
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - We have a good chance.

1567
00:48:25,555 --> 00:48:27,259
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Good.

1568
00:48:27,954 --> 00:48:29,253
(So Min won!)

1569
00:48:29,254 --> 00:48:30,285
That's all right.

1570
00:48:31,195 --> 00:48:32,893
(If she gets it right, she will be able to get both.)

1571
00:48:32,894 --> 00:48:33,933
Just choose anything.

1572
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:36,280
(Will So Min get it right?)

1573
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,074
(She found the bottle cap!)

1574
00:48:40,075 --> 00:48:41,103
Great, So Min!

1575
00:48:41,104 --> 00:48:42,134
(They won the 2-syllable open ticket and the priority to say the answer.)

1576
00:48:42,135 --> 00:48:43,244
You did it!

1577
00:48:43,245 --> 00:48:45,174
- Good job, good job. - So Min!

1578
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:46,203
- It's all right. - Okay.

1579
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:47,273
Should we go with 1 and 5?

1580
00:48:47,274 --> 00:48:48,313
I think we should go with 1 and 5.

1581
00:48:48,314 --> 00:48:51,744
The first letter might be confusing, though.

1582
00:48:51,745 --> 00:48:52,908
- "Ki". - "Ki".

1583
00:48:52,945 --> 00:48:54,154
- Should we go with eight, instead? - I don't know...

1584
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:56,014
- 8. - Go with 8.

1585
00:48:56,015 --> 00:48:57,249
(They decide to open 8 instead of 5.)

1586
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:59,224
This one's going to be hard.

1587
00:48:59,225 --> 00:49:01,523
Maybe it's something like the four steps to the conclusion. No?

1588
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:03,666
By the railway track

1589
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:07,793
(By the railway track)

1590
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:09,933
(What?)

1591
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,634
- "The hut by the railway track". - "The hut by the railway track".

1592
00:49:11,635 --> 00:49:13,195
- Wait a minute. - "The Hut By the Railway Track".

1593
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:14,674
(Seok Ja came up with the answer,)

1594
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,074
(But it's Team Jae Ni's turn to answer!)

1595
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:17,574
- "The hut by the railway track". - Let me answer.

1596
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,913
- "The hut by the railway track". - "The hut by the railway track".

1597
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,214
- Correct! - What were you thinking?

1598
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:22,643
("The hut by the railway track" is the correct answer.)

1599
00:49:22,644 --> 00:49:23,643
What were you thinking?

1600
00:49:23,644 --> 00:49:25,043
- We got it! - We got it!

1601
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:27,014
- Who said it? - We got it!

1602
00:49:27,015 --> 00:49:29,769
- Who said it? - It's the answer!

1603
00:49:30,354 --> 00:49:31,424
Who said it?

1604
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:32,753
(Look at Seok Jin!)

1605
00:49:32,754 --> 00:49:36,570
(It's like a funeral by the railway track.)

1606
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:39,094
- He's the best at this game. - He's so good.

1607
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:40,094
He's an expert.

1608
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,994
- He's so good at games. - This is driving me crazy.

1609
00:49:41,995 --> 00:49:44,248
If you choose one person...

1610
00:49:44,504 --> 00:49:46,034
from Team Grandpa,

1611
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:48,804
that person will get a hint on the most-beloved grandchild.

1612
00:49:48,805 --> 00:49:50,203
- Grandpa. - Grandpa, please.

1613
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,474
Choose the one who did their best.

1614
00:49:51,475 --> 00:49:53,474
He has to be careful about who he chooses,

1615
00:49:53,475 --> 00:49:55,974
or the race is going to get really difficult.

1616
00:49:55,975 --> 00:49:58,566
Grandpa, choose me. I'm the safest.

1617
00:49:58,615 --> 00:50:00,154
I'm nobody.

1618
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,683
Why don't you choose whoever...

1619
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,214
chooses the same one in rock-paper-scissors?

1620
00:50:03,215 --> 00:50:04,953
- I like it. Let's do that. - Okay.

1621
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:06,628
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

1622
00:50:07,024 --> 00:50:08,793
(Sang Yeob, So Min, and Kwang Soo choose rock.)

1623
00:50:08,794 --> 00:50:10,661
- Okay! - All right.

1624
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:11,793
- Wait a minute. - The same one, right?

1625
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:13,365
Let's go with heads or tails this time.

1626
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:14,994
- Heads or tails! - Heads or tails!

1627
00:50:14,995 --> 00:50:16,833
(Will it be the back of the hand or the palm of the hands?)

1628
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:18,569
(They will have to choose the same one in order to get the hint.)

1629
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:20,470
(Who will be the one to win the hint for the most-beloved grandchild?)

1630
00:50:20,535 --> 00:50:21,603
(Sang Yeob and Kwang Soo choose the back of the hand.)

1631
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:22,624
Okay!

1632
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:25,143
(Kwang Soo wins the hint for the most-beloved grandchild.)

1633
00:50:25,144 --> 00:50:27,334
(Why is Kwang Soo so happy?)

1634
00:50:27,335 --> 00:50:28,631
Kwang Soo, you are...

1635
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:30,857
Kwang Soo, you are...

1636
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,660
chosen as the grandparents' most-beloved grandchild.

1637
00:50:34,661 --> 00:50:36,830
(Kwang Soo is the most-beloved grandchild.)

1638
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,411
I'm my grandparents' most-beloved grandchild in real life.

1639
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:41,970
All right.

1640
00:50:41,971 --> 00:50:44,839
In order to win, you will have to hide your identity and find out...

1641
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,443
who the fake grandchild is and eliminate them.

1642
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,939
I will tell you two among the three fakes...

1643
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,810
who are after the performance exemption ticket.

1644
00:50:51,811 --> 00:50:53,220
- Three fakes? - Yes.

1645
00:50:53,221 --> 00:50:54,450
There are three fakes.

1646
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,053
They are...

1647
00:50:56,851 --> 00:50:59,167
A and B.

1648
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:02,759
However, once you reveal it to the others,

1649
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,137
the fakes will come after you...

1650
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,084
because the most-beloved grandchild is the only one who knows it.

1651
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,669
(He has to find the fakes without getting caught!)

1652
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,813
How could you tell him the answer...

1653
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,200
when he's the most suspicious one!

1654
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:17,270
- Grandpa! - I'll give it to So Min.

1655
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:19,240
(I'm going to give the hint to So Min!)

1656
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,279
- What? - Darn it.

1657
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,979
(I'm going to give the hint to So Min!)

1658
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,910
(What?)

1659
00:51:23,911 --> 00:51:25,850
- I'm sorry, but... - He's giving it to So Min.

1660
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:26,979
- I don't think you'll get it. - So Min.

1661
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:28,613
- He's giving it to So Min. - But I won.

1662
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,990
- What? - Sang Yeob wants to give it to me.

1663
00:51:29,991 --> 00:51:31,378
- Who will you give it to? - So Min.

1664
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:33,790
Then why did we play that game?

1665
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,490
- Come on... - It's my choice.

1666
00:51:36,491 --> 00:51:38,632
- That's true. - We can't trust Kwang Soo.

1667
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:40,463
He wants to give it to me.

1668
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,660
I'm sorry. Give it to me. Let go.

1669
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:45,270
(So Min wins the hint for the most-beloved grandchild.)

1670
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:46,291
What?

1671
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:47,799
It's not me.

1672
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,509
(The most-beloved grandchild's blood type is not AB.)

1673
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:52,339
What kind of hint is this?

1674
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,680
This can't be it. It's too vague.

1675
00:51:53,681 --> 00:51:54,680
Mine is, too.

1676
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:58,379
We will move on to the final race.

1677
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,410
- Okay! - Yes!

1678
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:01,460
(They move on to the last mission without much clue on the answer.)

1679
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,990
I'm going to catch them, for sure.

1680
00:52:03,991 --> 00:52:05,549
We need more information.

1681
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,790
You may win the couple performance exemption ticket...

1682
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,881
on this last mission.

1683
00:52:09,561 --> 00:52:11,193
- Please! - The exemption ticket.

1684
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:13,600
It is the Guest Room Family and the Lodger.

1685
00:52:13,601 --> 00:52:14,600
We have to do well in this one.

1686
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,129
If the most-beloved grandchild...

1687
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:18,870
or three of the real grandchildren get eliminated, the fakes win.

1688
00:52:18,871 --> 00:52:20,140
We need to be careful.

1689
00:52:20,141 --> 00:52:22,486
(If three of the real grandchildren get eliminated, the fakes win.)

1690
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,870
(They cannot attack anyone without a sure clue.)

1691
00:52:24,871 --> 00:52:26,442
We need to protect the most-beloved grandchild.

1692
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:28,680
For the real grandchildren, they will win...

1693
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:31,303
if they can eliminate just one of the fake grandchildren.

1694
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:32,910
Okay.

1695
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:34,583
Let me tell you how you can eliminate someone.

1696
00:52:34,681 --> 00:52:36,990
- You each have a job, right? - Yes.

1697
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,776
You have to find the object related to your job...

1698
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,396
in order to find out how to eliminate someone.

1699
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,859
However,

1700
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,529
if the game doesn't come to the conclusion...

1701
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,600
within the 60 minutes of the race,

1702
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:50,700
the stage that reveals your identities...

1703
00:52:50,701 --> 00:52:52,500
will open for three minutes.

1704
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:53,569
(The stage that reveals the members' identities will open!)

1705
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,200
- A stage? - If the real grandchildren...

1706
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:58,128
get on stage, the real grandchildren will win,

1707
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,933
but if there are any fake grandchildren, the fakes will win.

1708
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,770
I'm not sure about today.

1709
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,748
We need more clues.

1710
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,410
- We didn't get much. - No.

1711
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:09,779
Hints are hidden around regarding the real and fake grandchildren.

1712
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,520
(Hints are hidden around this big neighborhood.)

1713
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,589
Also, there is...

1714
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,520
- a guest room around here. - A guest room?

1715
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:17,890
It only opens at a certain time...

1716
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:19,589
and only the first three people to arrive can enter.

1717
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:20,600
- Okay. - There must be something in there.

1718
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:24,830
If three of the real grandchildren lay on the covers,

1719
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:26,361
an affectionate lullaby will play.

1720
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:28,480
If even one person is a fake,

1721
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,339
- weird music will play, - Okay.

1722
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,209
so you will be able to find the fake grandchild.

1723
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,339
However, you may not use force in the guest room.

1724
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,609
Please move on to the starting point.

1725
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,680
- Let's go! - Okay!

1726
00:53:38,681 --> 00:53:41,250
(They all move to the starting point, full of suspicions.)

1727
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,015
We barely have any hints.

1728
00:53:44,451 --> 00:53:47,259
(Kwang Soo, the most-beloved grandchild, knows the two fakes.)

1729
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,484
This is so hard.

1730
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,468
There are so many people I'm suspecting.

1731
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,359
I can't be certain about anyone, though.

1732
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,453
(He can't eliminate anyone without any hints!)

1733
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,154
The race starts now!

1734
00:53:56,831 --> 00:53:58,029
I'll have to find the weapon, first.

1735
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:01,370
(He has to find the weapon in order to eliminate the sure fakes!)

1736
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,040
I don't see anything, not even a hint.

1737
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:04,540
(Where are the hints or weapons?)

1738
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,280
I'm going to find the fakes.

1739
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:09,279
It must be somewhere around here.

1740
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,979
(Both the fake and the real grandchildren are needing hints.)

1741
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,776
They wouldn't make it too obvious.

1742
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,137
Hey, who do you think it is?

1743
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:18,819
I don't think it's among us three.

1744
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:20,120
- Haha, I'm... - Am I right?

1745
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:21,560
- I'm not it, for sure. - Right?

1746
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,660
- Am I right? - Yes.

1747
00:54:22,661 --> 00:54:23,890
- I don't think you're it, either. - I'm not it. I promise.

1748
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,459
Can you let me in on your hint? What was it?

1749
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,200
It said, "1 female and 2 males".

1750
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,864
- "1 female and 2 males"? - Really?

1751
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,770
(Haha was the only one who got the hint on the fakes.)

1752
00:54:32,771 --> 00:54:33,970
("Fakes are 2 men and 1 woman.")

1753
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:35,240
(He shares the exact hint...)

1754
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:38,709
(with Se Chan and Kwang Soo!)

1755
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,810
That seems too vague.

1756
00:54:39,811 --> 00:54:44,649
(He wouldn't have shared a hint on the fakes,)

1757
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,180
(if he were a fake.)

1758
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:47,711
- I think it's Jae Seok. - Jae Seok?

1759
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:49,445
And So Min.

1760
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,425
(Haha goes to look for another hint after sharing his hint.)

1761
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:57,853
(He finds a hint.)

1762
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:02,160
(Who will it be about?)

1763
00:55:02,161 --> 00:55:05,436
(The most-beloved grandchild is not a radio show host.)

1764
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:07,944
(Seok Jin is not the most-beloved grandchild!)

1765
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:10,336
Haha!

1766
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,640
(Seok Jin, who has been proved not to be the most-beloved, appears!)

1767
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:13,835
Did you find anything?

1768
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,609
Come over here.

1769
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:18,609
(He takes Haha to a private place...)

1770
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:20,879
(and starts to look around.)

1771
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,911
(No one is around, right?)

1772
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,829
I'm the most-beloved grandchild.

1773
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:29,027
(What nonsense!)

1774
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:31,330
(Seok Jin is confused at the unexpected reaction.)

1775
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,412
What's wrong?

1776
00:55:32,491 --> 00:55:34,093
You have to keep this a secret.

1777
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:37,091
- Please. - Seok Jin.

1778
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,330
You're so...

1779
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:40,035
You're so hilarious today.

1780
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:42,001
Why are you so funny today?

1781
00:55:42,741 --> 00:55:44,240
I'm the most-beloved grandchild.

1782
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,740
(How is he so shameless?)

1783
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,640
Hey, if you don't believe me,

1784
00:55:48,641 --> 00:55:50,793
just forget what I said. Forget it.

1785
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,432
I can't trust you anymore.

1786
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,528
Come on. Protect me.

1787
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:57,763
I need someone I can rely on.

1788
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:00,049
Seok Jin...

1789
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:01,386
(While the fake most-beloved grandchild is spewing nonsense...)

1790
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,819
- Kwang Soo! - Yes?

1791
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:04,211
Did you find anything?

1792
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:05,917
No, nothing.

1793
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,629
When will you start finding things?

1794
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,824
- What? - What?

1795
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:10,561
- What's this? You found anything? - What are you doing, Soo Hyang?

1796
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,197
(Soo Hyang found a weapon.)

1797
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:16,439
- Why are you all here? - "Grandma"...

1798
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,175
- How did you find this? - "Reading glasses"?

1799
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,439
(About this weapon...)

1800
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,339
- I found your weapon, Grandma. - Did you?

1801
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:23,881
You're on our team, aren't you?

1802
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,739
- You're on our team. - Here?

1803
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,350
You found my weapon!

1804
00:56:27,351 --> 00:56:28,580
(Jong Kook found Grandma's weapon and led Soo Hyang to it!)

1805
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:30,990
(Soo Hyang obtains her weapon!)

1806
00:56:30,991 --> 00:56:32,120
(Grandma: reading glasses)

1807
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,120
(Now that she has her weapon...)

1808
00:56:33,121 --> 00:56:35,319
You will now be able to...

1809
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,790
tear off the name tags of the other members.

1810
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,689
I can tear off their name tags and eliminate them?

1811
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:42,359
(She now has her weapon, so she's able to eliminate them!)

1812
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,270
- Is there a hint in there? - How did you find it?

1813
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:46,299
- Is it in words? - No.

1814
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,899
You have to find your own.

1815
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,533
Were you an unemployed person?

1816
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,509
I told you many times that I am not a jobless man.

1817
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,410
- Your job... - Why do you keep saying that?

1818
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,879
- You look like a jobless man. - I will find a job soon.

1819
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,879
Really?

1820
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,149
I will find a job this year no matter what.

1821
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,779
- I am on a job hunt. - You need to find the weapon...

1822
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,617
for the long-time bar exam student.

1823
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,919
- This is driving me crazy. - You are always...

1824
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,790
- either a spy... - I am not a spy!

1825
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:06,120
- or... - I am nothing today.

1826
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:07,189
a swindler.

1827
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,404
Soo Hyang, I will share the hint once I find...

1828
00:57:09,621 --> 00:57:11,120
(What?)

1829
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:15,188
(He finds a hint as soon as he finishes talking.)

1830
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,501
(What is the content of the hint Kwang Soo has found?)

1831
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:23,929
(One of the fakes is a man whose birth date includes 7.)

1832
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,934
(The grandchildren whose birth date includes 7 are...)

1833
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:29,629
(Then B is either So Min or Haha!)

1834
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:31,847
- Did you find anything? - No.

1835
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,715
Then what are you putting in the bag?

1836
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,520
What are you putting in the bag?

1837
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:39,000
A man like me...

1838
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,120
always takes notes, studies,

1839
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:43,202
- and observes. - I hate taking notes.

1840
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,990
The guest room is open.

1841
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,200
(At that moment, the guest room opens.)

1842
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:49,444
(Is the guest room opens?)

1843
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:51,299
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1844
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,770
- Let's go. - The three of us should go.

1845
00:57:52,771 --> 00:57:53,799
- Okay. - Let's go.

1846
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,899
- The three of us should go. - Okay.

1847
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,899
- Okay. - Let's go.

1848
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,910
- All right. - The three of us should go.

1849
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:58,400
- The guest room is open. - Where is the guest room?

1850
00:57:58,440 --> 00:57:59,460
Where is it?

1851
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,040
(They run towards the guest room.)

1852
00:58:01,041 --> 00:58:02,468
Let's hurry up before anyone gets there.

1853
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,094
(It's a good chance to figure out the fakes.)

1854
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,604
Where is the guest room?

1855
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,990
There it is.

1856
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:12,112
(What? It's the guest room!)

1857
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:13,790
The guest room.

1858
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,453
(They find the guest room!)

1859
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,290
(Is this the guest room?)

1860
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,483
(She gains information by chance.)

1861
00:58:18,891 --> 00:58:20,660
- The guest room. - Hold on.

1862
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:22,394
We need 3 people. Oh, there are 3 of us.

1863
00:58:22,661 --> 00:58:23,823
The three of us...

1864
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:25,399
You can't go in.

1865
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,799
(Ji Hyo runs towards the room, but she can't enter.)

1866
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,100
- Please. - My goodness.

1867
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:29,100
No, no.

1868
00:58:29,101 --> 00:58:30,609
There are three people inside.

1869
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:32,410
- Are there people inside? - For goodness' sake.

1870
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:34,209
- Are there people inside? - The room is full.

1871
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,209
- Let's go inside. - For goodness' sake.

1872
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,779
What were the rules?

1873
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,209
- If... - They are going in.

1874
00:58:38,451 --> 00:58:40,082
If all three of them are real grandchildren,

1875
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,651
a lullaby will play.

1876
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,075
This is nice.

1877
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,589
If we hear weird music...

1878
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,189
That will be really weird.

1879
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,990
(If they are real grandchildren, a lullaby will play.)

1880
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,189
- That will be chilling. - Hold on.

1881
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,890
- Only we can hear the music, right? - That's right.

1882
00:58:51,891 --> 00:58:54,043
(Their hearts beat fast.)

1883
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:57,958
- Grandma and two others went in. - Yes.

1884
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,430
I bet the lullaby won't play.

1885
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:01,069
Grandma is in danger.

1886
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:04,273
I am sure Jae Seok and Se Chan are fakes.

1887
00:59:04,411 --> 00:59:05,810
Grandma will be eliminated there.

1888
00:59:05,811 --> 00:59:06,810
Let's hear which music plays.

1889
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:09,209
Grandma will be eliminated there.

1890
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,046
(Grandma might be in danger.)

1891
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,120
(Will there be a fake as Jong Kook predicted?)

1892
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,220
- Grandma, sing us a lullaby. - Grandma, sing us a lullaby.

1893
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:18,261
(Grandma, sing us a lullaby.)

1894
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:20,991
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E453 Running Man</font>

1895
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:24,790
(If all three are real family, an affectionate lullaby will play.)

1896
00:59:24,791 --> 00:59:29,249
(If even one person is a fake, weird music will play.)

1897
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,610
(My goodness.)

1898
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,069
What?

1899
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:36,439
(It's not a lullaby!)

1900
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,460
It's not a lullaby.

1901
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,339
(One of them is a fake!)

1902
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,779
Then one of us is a fake. Hold on. Hold on.

1903
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,310
- Hey. - My goodness.

1904
00:59:44,311 --> 00:59:45,310
I can't believe you.

1905
00:59:45,311 --> 00:59:46,779
- My goodness. - No way.

1906
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,149
- I can't believe you. - No way.

1907
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,202
My goodness.

1908
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,055
I did think you were suspicious.

1909
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:53,819
Both of you were suspicious...

1910
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,189
- from the start. - Will we be the only ones...

1911
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,189
to know this information?

1912
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,189
(I have to relay this information.)

1913
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,330
It wasn't a lullaby!

1914
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:01,229
(It wasn't a lullaby!)

1915
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,560
- What? - It wasn't a lullaby!

1916
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:04,799
- One of them is a fake. - It wasn't a lullaby!

1917
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,229
We know that Grandma isn't a fake.

1918
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,629
- Grandma isn't a fake. - Hold on.

1919
01:00:08,001 --> 01:00:09,169
- Okay. - Hold on.

1920
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,009
Then one of them is a fake.

1921
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,040
Okay.

1922
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,509
It's either Jae Seok or Se Chan.

1923
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,109
- I am not a fake. - This is...

1924
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:16,680
- What are you doing? - Go.

1925
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:17,680
Go away.

1926
01:00:17,681 --> 01:00:19,009
- It's 100 percent. - Go away.

1927
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:20,919
(They don't know who the most-beloved grandchild is.)

1928
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,580
Se Chan, I can't believe you.

1929
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,620
(However, one thing is certain.)

1930
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,990
- In any case, - Okay.

1931
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:27,720
- we got... - It's one of them.

1932
01:00:27,721 --> 01:00:29,319
- a rough sense. - We don't know the number, right?

1933
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,890
We don't know the number of the fakes, right?

1934
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:32,129
We don't know the number.

1935
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,600
We know that Grandma isn't a fake.

1936
01:00:34,601 --> 01:00:35,600
It's either one of them.

1937
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,430
- It's either one of them... - It could be both of them.

1938
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:38,552
or both of them.

1939
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:40,799
(Se Chan became a strong candidate for a fake after the guest room.)

1940
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,339
I haven't found a single hint.

1941
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,310
How could they corner me so much...

1942
01:00:45,311 --> 01:00:47,879
just because I entered the guest room once?

1943
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,340
(Is he a fake who is pretending to be upset?)

1944
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,080
Now...

1945
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:54,264
We should remove Se Chan's name tag.

1946
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,254
We should remove Se Chan's name tag.

1947
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,295
(Is Jae Seok real and Se Chan fake?)

1948
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:03,985
I think he is a fake. His facial expression...

1949
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:07,799
It shows because he isn't a good actor.

1950
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,157
Se Chan...

1951
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:12,488
has behaved strangely from the start.

1952
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:14,339
He hasn't asked us...

1953
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,569
about the hints either.

1954
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:18,202
It's strange behavior.

1955
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:19,810
For goodness' sake.

1956
01:01:19,811 --> 01:01:21,953
(Is Se Chan a fake grandchild as everyone thinks?)

1957
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,223
Who is the most-beloved grandchild?

1958
01:01:24,911 --> 01:01:26,779
(They can't eliminate Se Chan on a presumption.)

1959
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,076
Here it is.

1960
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:31,450
(At that moment, he finds a hint!)

1961
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:32,543
Okay.

1962
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,359
Here it is.

1963
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,720
(The hint Seok Jin found is...)

1964
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:37,430
(The most-beloved grandchild has appeared in a movie.)

1965
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:40,560
(That means Se Chan isn't the most-beloved grandchild.)

1966
01:01:40,561 --> 01:01:41,622
All right.

1967
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:43,229
(They can remove Se Chan's name tag now.)

1968
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:44,731
We should remove Se Chan's name tag.

1969
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:49,102
(Se Chan doesn't know about the new hint.)

1970
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:53,277
(Seok Jin found his weapon earlier and can remove name tags.)

1971
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,109
(To make sure that Se Chan doesn't see him,)

1972
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:59,936
(Seok Jin follows Se Chan discreetly.)

1973
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:05,709
(Real grandchildren win if they eliminate one fake.)

1974
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,393
(If Se Chan is a fake, real grandchildren will win.)

1975
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:12,689
(He succeeds to grab Se Chan's name tag.)

1976
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:13,710
What?

1977
01:02:14,561 --> 01:02:15,683
(Ripping)

1978
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,500
(He removes Se Chan's name tag!)

1979
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:19,899
- Let's see it. - Seok Jin.

1980
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,124
(Is Se Chan a fake as Seok Jin predicted?)

1981
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:28,391
(Is he a real grandchild who was falsely accused?)

1982
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:31,509
(What?)

1983
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,680
- What? - Se Chan isn't a fake.

1984
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,319
(Se Chan isn't...)

1985
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,248
(a fake grandchild.)

1986
01:02:37,751 --> 01:02:39,520
- What? - He isn't a fake.

1987
01:02:39,521 --> 01:02:41,153
- Are you serious? - He isn't a fake.

1988
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,220
He isn't a fake.

1989
01:02:43,221 --> 01:02:45,089
I told you I am not a fake!

1990
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:47,273
- He isn't a fake. - It's okay.

1991
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:52,500
(Did the lullaby not play in the guest room...)

1992
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:57,069
(because Jae Seok is a fake grandchild?)

1993
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:59,910
- For goodness' sake. - That means Jae Seok is a fake.

1994
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:00,910
Jae Seok.

1995
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:03,461
- It's Jae Seok. - I am 100 percent sure.

1996
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:05,450
It's Jae Seok.

1997
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:07,580
(Did they finally figure out the identity of a fake grandchild?)

1998
01:03:07,581 --> 01:03:11,529
(Then they must eliminate Jae Seok.)

1999
01:03:11,991 --> 01:03:13,959
- It's Jae Seok. - I can't believe it.

2000
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,266
- I am not a fake. - It's Jae Seok.

2001
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,719
Gosh, this is...

2002
01:03:19,431 --> 01:03:21,807
(He finds a hint.)

2003
01:03:23,661 --> 01:03:26,863
(What is the content of the hint Jae Seok found?)

2004
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,330
(Oh!)

2005
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,410
(He becomes shocked upon seeing the hint.)

2006
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:35,552
(What could it be?)

2007
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,900
(Did he find the hint on the most-beloved grandchild?)

2008
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:45,082
(Jae Seok found his weapon earlier and can remove name tags.)

2009
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:47,990
(He takes sure steps.)

2010
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,857
I can't stop suspecting them.

2011
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,862
Think about it.

2012
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:54,000
(He succeeds to get close...)

2013
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:56,551
(to Kwang Soo.)

2014
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,169
Is it him?

2015
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:00,067
(At that moment!)

2016
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,669
(Jae Seok grabs the name tag that belongs...)

2017
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,742
(to Ji Hyo!)

2018
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:11,674
(Why is he trying to remove Ji Hyo's name tag?)

2019
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:15,180
(After a fierce struggle...)

2020
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:16,853
(Ripping)

2021
01:04:17,351 --> 01:04:18,950
(Ji Hyo, the real grandchild, is out.)

2022
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:20,318
What? What is going on?

2023
01:04:21,491 --> 01:04:23,319
- It's not Ji Hyo. - She isn't a fake.

2024
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,129
I told you I am not a fake.

2025
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,729
- Ji Hyo. - It's Jae Seok.

2026
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:28,700
I am 100 percent sure.

2027
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:29,956
I am 100 percent sure he is a fake.

2028
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,129
- It's Jae Seok. - Come on.

2029
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,029
- We need to catch him! - Run!

2030
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,091
(He rips off Ji Hyo's name tag and runs away at full speed.)

2031
01:04:34,601 --> 01:04:36,600
(Catch Jae Seok!)

2032
01:04:36,601 --> 01:04:37,810
- Hurry up! - Catch him!

2033
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,669
The guest room is open.

2034
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:40,810
(The guest room opens.)

2035
01:04:40,811 --> 01:04:42,410
- The guest room is open. - The guest room!

2036
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,709
Run! Come on!

2037
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,709
(Jae Seok runs towards the guest room.)

2038
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:47,979
(Once he goes in, people can't remove his name tag.)

2039
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:49,408
Come on!

2040
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,120
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2041
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,589
(Right before Kwang Soo catches Jae Seok,)

2042
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,589
(he enters the guest room.)

2043
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:57,089
- Go in. - I need to go in.

2044
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,559
Kwang Soo. Kwang Soo.

2045
01:04:58,931 --> 01:05:00,490
What? What?

2046
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:01,755
What is going on?

2047
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,993
Hold on. Why did I...

2048
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,669
- Why did I enter? - Wait.

2049
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,899
For goodness' sake.

2050
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,899
The guest room is full.

2051
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,500
So Min should have entered.

2052
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,669
I am not a fake.

2053
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,810
Hey, why did you enter?

2054
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:15,779
Kwang Soo, Jae Seok, and Sang Yeob entered.

2055
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,209
Let's wait and see the result.

2056
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:18,779
Let's wait and see the result.

2057
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,310
Let's not remove each other's name tag now.

2058
01:05:20,311 --> 01:05:22,520
What's important is that Jae Seok was in the guest room...

2059
01:05:22,521 --> 01:05:24,319
- earlier and now. - Okay.

2060
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,819
- Okay. - This is driving me crazy.

2061
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,990
It could be Jae Seok's fit of desperation.

2062
01:05:27,991 --> 01:05:30,319
- That's what it is, right? - We have seen that many times.

2063
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:31,729
It's a fit of desperation.

2064
01:05:31,730 --> 01:05:34,660
This will give us a direction.

2065
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:36,700
- This is driving me crazy. - I will pull the blankets.

2066
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:38,231
This is driving me crazy.

2067
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,260
(Kwang Soo is very troubled.)

2068
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:42,500
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2069
01:05:42,501 --> 01:05:45,194
- Grandma, sing us a lullaby. - Grandma, sing us a lullaby.

2070
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,609
- Grandma. - Grandma.

2071
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:50,310
(Is there a chance...)

2072
01:05:50,311 --> 01:05:53,209
(they will hear a lullaby?)

2073
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,319
(It's not a lullaby.)

2074
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,340
See?

2075
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,845
(I knew it.)

2076
01:06:00,351 --> 01:06:02,890
(It's just as they thought.)

2077
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:04,830
(Jae Seok must be a fake grandchild.)

2078
01:06:04,831 --> 01:06:06,361
The two of you could be fakes.

2079
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,060
- The two of us? - Yes.

2080
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:09,660
Jae Seok, I will be honest.

2081
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:11,069
- Hold on. - The production crew...

2082
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,399
wouldn't give us such important roles.

2083
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:16,600
(Leave me out. I am the most-beloved grandchild.)

2084
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:17,709
Jae Seok.

2085
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,709
(It's a very important role.)

2086
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,730
Why?

2087
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:22,068
This is driving me crazy.

2088
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,453
- My goodness. - Let's go outside.

2089
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,209
It's not me.

2090
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:27,250
Who is it?

2091
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:29,362
- A man... - I think it is...

2092
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:30,680
I am Grandma.

2093
01:06:30,681 --> 01:06:32,089
- I... - It wasn't Se Chan.

2094
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,350
I thought it was Se Chan.

2095
01:06:33,351 --> 01:06:34,620
- I can't believe it. - It wasn't Se Chan.

2096
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:36,089
- Then it's you. - One more thing.

2097
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:37,430
- Come on out. - There is...

2098
01:06:37,431 --> 01:06:39,629
a reason why I removed Ji Hyo's name tag.

2099
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,650
You...

2100
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,660
(Kwang Soo goes back into the guest room.)

2101
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:44,538
- Hey. - My goodness.

2102
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,169
My blood pressure is rising.

2103
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:48,242
(Why did Kwang Soo go back into the room?)

2104
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,705
(It seems like he found something strange in the room.)

2105
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:53,271
If it wasn't Se Chan, then you're the fake grandchild. No?

2106
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,311
If you exclude Grandma and Grandpa...

2107
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,149
and combine A's hints, what remains is Ji Hyo.

2108
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:00,009
(If you combine A's hints, what remains is Ji Hyo.)

2109
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:01,649
- Really? - That's why I eliminated Ji Hyo.

2110
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,487
(Please believe me.)

2111
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,649
(Jae Seok's first hint)

2112
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:07,960
- I'm not a fake. - No.

2113
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,164
(What was the hint that Jae Seok found?)

2114
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:12,090
It's about A.

2115
01:07:12,091 --> 01:07:14,029
(It's a hint about fake A.)

2116
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,003
(It excludes Kwang Soo, Seok Jin, and So Min.)

2117
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,370
Look at this.

2118
01:07:19,371 --> 01:07:20,871
(He finds his second hint.)

2119
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,210
(It's the hint that surprised Jae Seok.)

2120
01:07:24,211 --> 01:07:25,370
(Fake A is an actor.)

2121
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:26,939
"Fake A is an actor"?

2122
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:29,021
(The second hint is related to fake A.)

2123
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:31,040
(If fake A is an actor...)

2124
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:32,836
Fake A is Ji Hyo then.

2125
01:07:33,881 --> 01:07:37,186
(That's why he eliminated Ji Hyo without any hesitation.)

2126
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,490
(However, Ji Hyo wasn't fake A.)

2127
01:07:41,491 --> 01:07:45,130
(While being suspected as the fake grandchild, Jae Seok is cornered.)

2128
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:47,304
I'm creeped out.

2129
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:48,381
Wait.

2130
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,331
That's why I eliminated Ji Hyo.

2131
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,469
However, it's not Ji Hyo.

2132
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:55,969
(If it's not Ji Hyo, who could be fake A?)

2133
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,040
(Kwang Soo has been staying in the room.)

2134
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:01,679
(He gets closer to a photo.)

2135
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,732
What's this?

2136
01:08:04,511 --> 01:08:06,929
(Why is he looking at the photo all of a sudden?)

2137
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,319
I know what this is.

2138
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,912
(The photo looks strange.)

2139
01:08:10,951 --> 01:08:13,990
(Grandpa and Grandma were in the photo.)

2140
01:08:13,991 --> 01:08:17,160
(However, they look different from the photo.)

2141
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:18,429
(And)

2142
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:21,257
(7 grandchildren are in the photo?)

2143
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:24,870
(We have 5 grandchildren. Why are there 8 of you?)

2144
01:08:24,871 --> 01:08:28,615
(She clearly said there are only 5 grandchildren.)

2145
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,870
(Grandma and Grandpa are also fake.)

2146
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,391
(The number of grandchildren that they said is different.)

2147
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:39,856
(There are 3 fakes including the grandparents.)

2148
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:44,590
(The 3 fakes are Grandma, Grandpa,)

2149
01:08:44,591 --> 01:08:47,819
(and 1 fake grandchild.)

2150
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:51,290
(Who is the fake grandchild?)

2151
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,025
However, it's not Ji Hyo.

2152
01:08:53,131 --> 01:08:54,160
- Why? How? - That's because...

2153
01:08:54,161 --> 01:08:55,800
there's Im Soo Hyang.

2154
01:08:55,801 --> 01:08:58,014
(Fake A must be Im Soo Hyang.)

2155
01:08:58,331 --> 01:09:02,740
(2 hints related to fake A)

2156
01:09:02,741 --> 01:09:06,569
(Strange music that was played in the room)

2157
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:08,212
(Fake A is Im Soo Hyang.)

2158
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,647
(2 fakes are finally revealed.)

2159
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:15,798
2 out of 3 fakes who are after the exemption ticket are...

2160
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,192
Im Soo Hyang and Lee Sang Yeob.

2161
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:20,630
There is one fake among the grandchildren.

2162
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,527
- The grandparents are fake. - They're fake.

2163
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,960
Members will think that...

2164
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,612
there are three fakes grandchildren.

2165
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:30,729
(An important hint to prove 2 fakes)

2166
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:31,929
They'll believe it once they see this.

2167
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:33,052
(Photo that Kwang Soo found will be proof.)

2168
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,599
(According to the hint, fakes are 1 woman and 2 men.)

2169
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,223
(So, the fake grandchild is a man.)

2170
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:41,210
- Come here, Jong Kook. - What?

2171
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:43,322
(He calls Kook Soon.)

2172
01:09:44,511 --> 01:09:45,750
What's this?

2173
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:46,801
(He shares the hint with Jong Kook.)

2174
01:09:47,211 --> 01:09:48,506
There are seven.

2175
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,434
Grandma and Grandpa are fake.

2176
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:54,889
(Grandma and Grandpa are fake?)

2177
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,942
Really?

2178
01:09:56,591 --> 01:09:57,712
Then...

2179
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,260
- it's not Jae Seok. - It isn't.

2180
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:02,831
(Granddaughters Jae Ni and Seok Ja are not the fake ones.)

2181
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,059
- It's not Jae Seok. - It isn't.

2182
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,069
(The only grandson who remains)

2183
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:07,121
That means...

2184
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,094
It's So Min.

2185
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,210
I'm not. I'm a man. I'm really not it.

2186
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:14,069
I'm confused. There are two men.

2187
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:15,080
(And)

2188
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:16,109
It's either So Min or Haha.

2189
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,210
(The other grandson is Haha.)

2190
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:19,301
I swear.

2191
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:20,950
I'm really not it.

2192
01:10:20,951 --> 01:10:22,779
(Which one is the fake grandchild?)

2193
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,450
Here's what's going on.

2194
01:10:24,451 --> 01:10:25,790
(Fake grandpa Sang Yeob)

2195
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,229
I think people over there mentioned my name.

2196
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,842
Soo Hyang.

2197
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:32,581
Go to the mountain.

2198
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:34,185
Run away to the mountain.

2199
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,700
(Did people find out?)

2200
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:36,854
I should hide.

2201
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:39,429
(At times like this,)

2202
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,670
(hiding is the best plan.)

2203
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:41,824
Gosh, Soo Hyang.

2204
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:43,540
(He feels very betrayed.)

2205
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,408
I didn't think that it'd be Soo Hyang.

2206
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:49,609
(They're narrowing down who might be the fake grandchildren.)

2207
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:52,160
(Haha enters the room.)

2208
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,480
(Haha sees the photo as well.)

2209
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,389
- That photo... - We found the photo.

2210
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,442
(The fake grandchild is a man.)

2211
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,960
You're on the suspect list.

2212
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:04,090
Okay, you can be suspicious of me. I'm not it anyway.

2213
01:11:04,091 --> 01:11:05,693
- You know that you're on the list? - Yes.

2214
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:08,301
Grandpa and Grandma are fake.

2215
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:11,462
(Haha says that he's not the fake one. Then, who is he?)

2216
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:13,362
There's nothing over there.

2217
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:15,700
We shouldn't go where there's nothing.

2218
01:11:15,701 --> 01:11:16,969
We should go where there's something.

2219
01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:18,069
There's nothing.

2220
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,109
(Which one is fake, Haha or So Min?)

2221
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:20,109
Let's go.

2222
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,779
(Which one is fake, Haha or So Min?)

2223
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,939
Where did Soo Hyang go?

2224
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,041
(Feeling betrayed, Jae Seok chases after the fake grandma.)

2225
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:30,119
(She's running away from Jae Seok.)

2226
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:33,050
(He approaches where she is after hearing sounds.)

2227
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:34,189
Soo Hyang.

2228
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,620
(Soo Hyang!)

2229
01:11:35,621 --> 01:11:36,960
(They finally come face to face.)

2230
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,082
I didn't know it'd be you.

2231
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:40,529
- Soo Hyang. - Isn't it you?

2232
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,786
- Did you fool me? - Jae Seok.

2233
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:43,658
- Isn't it you? - Did you fool me?

2234
01:11:44,001 --> 01:11:47,499
(She can't avoid him anymore.)

2235
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:51,025
- Will you eliminate me? - You're the only one, Soo Hyang.

2236
01:11:51,070 --> 01:11:53,458
- Jae Seok. - Soo Hyang.

2237
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:56,279
(It's a fight of who eliminates the name tag first.)

2238
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,107
(If she takes off Jae Seok's name tag, the race is over.)

2239
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:01,462
(Right then!)

2240
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,649
(Jae Seok grabs Soo Hyang's name tag first.)

2241
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,849
Is it Soo Hyang?

2242
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:07,116
(Is it Soo Hyang's scream?)

2243
01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:09,537
What should I do?

2244
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:13,240
(Haha moves when he hears the scream.)

2245
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,277
(So Min spots Soo Hyang and Jae Seok first.)

2246
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:18,800
So Min.

2247
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,870
(If So Min helps Soo Hyang...)

2248
01:12:20,871 --> 01:12:23,170
(and eliminates Jae Seok, the race is over.)

2249
01:12:23,171 --> 01:12:24,510
(At that time)

2250
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,809
(So Min runs towards Soo Hyang.)

2251
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:26,830
Grab her.

2252
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,880
(So Min helps Jae Seok.)

2253
01:12:29,881 --> 01:12:31,880
All right. Let's talk this out.

2254
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,050
It's Soo Hyang.

2255
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:34,131
Did you eliminate her name tag?

2256
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:35,845
- Whose name tag got eliminated? - Who?

2257
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,704
Here you go.

2258
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:39,649
- Do you see it? - No.

2259
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,359
- It's Soo Hyang. - She's the fake grandma.

2260
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,490
(Soo Hyang is the fake grandma.)

2261
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,602
(Fake grandma Soo Hyang is out.)

2262
01:12:44,991 --> 01:12:47,275
- You know what? - It's shocking.

2263
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:48,952
I'm shocked.

2264
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,300
Whose name tag is torn off?

2265
01:12:50,301 --> 01:12:51,330
- Soo Hyang's name tag. - Soo Hyang's.

2266
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:52,493
- What? - Soo Hyang's name tag.

2267
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:53,724
What was Soo Hyang?

2268
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:55,832
- Isn't she fake? - Isn't she fake?

2269
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,371
(Fake grandpa Sang Yeob is revealed.)

2270
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,380
(They still don't know who the fake grandchild is.)

2271
01:13:03,381 --> 01:13:05,849
- How could you do this? - How could you?

2272
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,819
- How could you do this? - How can you, Grandmother?

2273
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:10,979
Did she get caught?

2274
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,120
Did she get caught?

2275
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,090
(He's still trying to understand the situation.)

2276
01:13:14,091 --> 01:13:16,319
(At that time)

2277
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,484
Did she get caught?

2278
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:18,830
- She got caught. - Hey.

2279
01:13:18,831 --> 01:13:19,859
(Haha approaches Sang Yeob.)

2280
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:20,929
Unbelievable.

2281
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:21,982
What?

2282
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,830
(Haha knows what Sang Yeob is.)

2283
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:27,157
What's going on?

2284
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:30,863
(He attacks the fake grandpa Sang Yeob.)

2285
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:33,710
- My goodness. - What's wrong?

2286
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:35,068
- What's going on? - What?

2287
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,457
(He tears it off without hesitating.)

2288
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:38,710
(Sang Yeob is out.)

2289
01:13:38,711 --> 01:13:39,832
- What? - That's right.

2290
01:13:40,211 --> 01:13:41,279
- He's fake Grandpa. - Right.

2291
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,679
- That's right. - What?

2292
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,813
(2 fakes except one fake grandchild are out.)

2293
01:13:46,091 --> 01:13:48,859
(Team Grandchildren wins if the fake grandchild is out.)

2294
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:49,983
He's fake Grandpa.

2295
01:13:49,991 --> 01:13:51,859
See? He's fake Grandpa.

2296
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,217
(So Min helped Jae Seok eliminate Soo Hyang.)

2297
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:54,859
The photo was right.

2298
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,359
(Haha has eliminated Sang Yeob.)

2299
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:00,921
(Who could be the fake grandchild?)

2300
01:14:01,741 --> 01:14:02,995
- Wait. - Okay.

2301
01:14:03,201 --> 01:14:04,740
(At that time)

2302
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:06,510
(Seok Jin attacks So Min.)

2303
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:07,910
- It's not me. - Wait.

2304
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:09,080
- I swear it's not me. - Wait.

2305
01:14:09,081 --> 01:14:10,479
- Wait. - It's not me.

2306
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:11,910
- Wait. - I swear it's not me.

2307
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:14,279
- We'll find out when you're out. - It's not me.

2308
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,550
- I'm pretty sure it's you. - Tear it off.

2309
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,703
There are two left.

2310
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:19,371
- I swear that it's not me. - It's not you?

2311
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:21,389
- He's definitely it. - She's the one.

2312
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,993
- It's definite. - It's 1 of the 2.

2313
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,290
There are two men.

2314
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,660
It's a grandson.

2315
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,859
- It's a grandson. - It's a grandson.

2316
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,429
- It's not a granddaughter. - Listen.

2317
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:30,500
Tearing off Sang Yeob's name tag is part of his plan.

2318
01:14:30,501 --> 01:14:32,469
- It's clear now. - Okay.

2319
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:33,469
He's fake.

2320
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,769
- Isn't it you? - Haha is faking his identity.

2321
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,433
- I swear to you. - It's not me.

2322
01:14:37,871 --> 01:14:38,992
It's 1 of the 2.

2323
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,255
Raise your hand... Wait, wait.

2324
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:42,534
I'm not the fake grandson.

2325
01:14:43,381 --> 01:14:45,279
- Time is up. - He's the fake one.

2326
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,450
- I'm serious. - I swear to you.

2327
01:14:46,451 --> 01:14:47,950
I even eliminated Sang Yeob.

2328
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,266
(Fake grandchild isn't revealed.)

2329
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,319
You're good at acting.

2330
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,290
- I approve of your acting. - You're a great actor.

2331
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:56,025
- You're very good at acting. - She's the best.

2332
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,790
- I'm learning a lot from you, Haha. - I approve.

2333
01:14:58,791 --> 01:15:00,059
- Seriously. - Seriously.

2334
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,937
- My movies failed for reasons. - No.

2335
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,800
Haha, why did you...

2336
01:15:03,801 --> 01:15:05,870
tear off Grandpa's name tag all of a sudden?

2337
01:15:05,871 --> 01:15:07,069
I had to.

2338
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:09,651
I saw the photo over there.

2339
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,969
We could have gone together, but why did you do it alone?

2340
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,210
He was turning away from me.

2341
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:14,340
- It was an opportunity. - He didn't want to be suspected.

2342
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:15,340
Really?

2343
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:16,540
- He didn't want to be suspected. - I'm serious.

2344
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:17,765
What else could I do?

2345
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,714
- Why don't you sound desperate? - Are you happy now?

2346
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,279
- Why... - Do you know why?

2347
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:24,250
It's because I'm real. That's why I'm not talking much.

2348
01:15:24,251 --> 01:15:26,332
Fake ones talk a lot.

2349
01:15:26,991 --> 01:15:28,290
- Like him. - If she's fake,

2350
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,319
it'll be a big mess. Do you remember last time?

2351
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,942
I remember. Fake ones always talk a lot.

2352
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,434
Let me say this one last time.

2353
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,760
I had to catch Soo Hyang...

2354
01:15:37,761 --> 01:15:39,569
to remove my false charge.

2355
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:42,099
I did everything to chase Soo Hyang.

2356
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,599
When I called for help,

2357
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,069
- So Min came. - I ran over.

2358
01:15:45,070 --> 01:15:46,609
- She helped without hesitating. - I helped him.

2359
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,010
It could be fake.

2360
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:50,109
- That's what I don't know. - Then Haha was faking himself too.

2361
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,784
This is driving me crazy.

2362
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:53,603
In fact,

2363
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,920
- Haha gave me all the hints. - I gave him everything.

2364
01:15:57,921 --> 01:15:59,050
He did...

2365
01:15:59,051 --> 01:16:01,189
because we didn't know about the grandparents.

2366
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:02,859
It could've been a disadvantage, but he shared them.

2367
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:05,429
- He was considering... - Here's what I insisted on.

2368
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:08,059
I asked people to gather around if they aren't fake ones.

2369
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,244
I was the first to arrive.

2370
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:13,029
(After the second mission was over,)

2371
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,724
(Team Grandpa won a hint.)

2372
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,769
- I'll show it to So Min. - What?

2373
01:16:18,770 --> 01:16:23,433
(Fake grandpa shared his hint with So Min.)

2374
01:16:24,810 --> 01:16:27,080
It's strange that he didn't take initiative.

2375
01:16:27,081 --> 01:16:29,324
- I think it's So Min. - I swear it's not me.

2376
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,279
(So Min is the fake one.)

2377
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,689
- She's the fake? - So Min is a fake grandchild.

2378
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,420
I think... Do you think I'm the fake one?

2379
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:35,992
It's too confusing.

2380
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,922
You must believe me.

2381
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,022
I worked very hard today.

2382
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:41,456
By the way,

2383
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:44,059
- So Min sincerely helped me. - Did she?

2384
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,429
- His intuition is correct. - She really did.

2385
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,429
- I'm sincere too. - This is so difficult.

2386
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:48,829
(It's confusing to find out who the fake grandchild is.)

2387
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,574
It's time to decide.

2388
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:53,370
- You go tear it off. - You tear it off.

2389
01:16:53,371 --> 01:16:54,769
- Go ahead. - You tear it off.

2390
01:16:54,881 --> 01:16:56,740
It's really not me.

2391
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:57,779
(Is it So Min?)

2392
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,010
(Or Haha?)

2393
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:01,103
Go, Kwang Soo!

2394
01:17:01,881 --> 01:17:03,176
I don't know what to do.

2395
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:04,889
I can't do it.

2396
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:06,216
It's really confusing.

2397
01:17:06,350 --> 01:17:08,360
- I have no idea. - I have no idea either.

2398
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:10,019
Let's just do it.

2399
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:11,389
(Team Fake wins if a real grandchild is out.)

2400
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:12,460
One.

2401
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,490
(Who is the fake grandchild?)

2402
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:14,581
Two.

2403
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,899
(Is it So Min who finds it unfair?)

2404
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,217
(Is it Haha who plays innocent?)

2405
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,639
Three.

2406
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:22,840
(What's the result of the race?)

2407
01:17:22,841 --> 01:17:24,740
(Tearing)

2408
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:27,801
(Haha is picked as the fake grandson.)

2409
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:29,380
(If Haha is a real grandson,)

2410
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:31,799
(Team Fake wins.)

2411
01:17:32,051 --> 01:17:34,510
(What is Haha?)

2412
01:17:34,511 --> 01:17:36,419
- Okay! - See?

2413
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:38,490
(What is Haha?)

2414
01:17:38,491 --> 01:17:40,592
See? I'm not fake.

2415
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:44,110
(Fake grandson Haha is out.)

2416
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:48,700
(The real grandchildren are the final winners.)

2417
01:17:48,701 --> 01:17:50,559
I told you that I wasn't it.

2418
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,729
- See? I'm not fake. - I was right.

2419
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:54,330
- I really am not. - I told you.

2420
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:56,139
- It wasn't So Min. - Good job.

2421
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,425
(We could have won.)

2422
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:01,696
(Today morning before the shoot)

2423
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,479
- Hello. - Hello, hello.

2424
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:08,295
Both of you will be assisting Haha who is a fake grandchild.

2425
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,450
You'll pretend to be grandparents...

2426
01:18:10,451 --> 01:18:12,149
who aren't back from their trip.

2427
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:15,181
You'll play fake grandparents.

2428
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:16,517
A grandpa?

2429
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:19,359
My goodness. Is this what I should do?

2430
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,359
Two of them are too positive.

2431
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,114
(They were determined to win by acting passionately.)

2432
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,469
Haha is picked to participate in the couple performance.

2433
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,870
He has to pick one of you.

2434
01:18:31,871 --> 01:18:33,166
(He must pick from real grandchildren.)

2435
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:37,809
(Only 1 paper has X written on it among 7 papers.)

2436
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:39,479
If you pick the one that has X written on it, you'll join...

2437
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,819
(What?)

2438
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,479
- Wait. - That's wrong.

2439
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,189
- What? - That's not right.

2440
01:18:45,190 --> 01:18:46,219
What's that?

2441
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,090
- Everyone, calm down. - Could it be me when...

2442
01:18:48,091 --> 01:18:49,790
I'm the most-beloved?

2443
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:51,189
It's a big picture of the crew.

2444
01:18:51,491 --> 01:18:52,889
It's a big picture.

2445
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,099
Whoever it turns out to be,

2446
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,300
he or she has to perform with Haha.

2447
01:18:56,301 --> 01:18:58,269
Let's open it as soon as you pick one.

2448
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:00,429
Yes, open it as soon as you pick.

2449
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:01,664
I'm nervous.

2450
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:03,062
Here you go.

2451
01:19:03,341 --> 01:19:04,969
- Do it in the count of three. - It has X written on it.

2452
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,980
- "X"? His might be the one. - What if his has X on it?

2453
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:09,939
(Kwang Soo passes.)

2454
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:11,134
Okay.

2455
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:14,359
(He reacts out of joy.)

2456
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:17,279
It's a lot of pressure.

2457
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,389
Three.

2458
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:19,819
(Seok Jin passes as well.)

2459
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,350
(I didn't want Seok Jin either.)

2460
01:19:21,451 --> 01:19:22,719
2, 3.

2461
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,527
(So Min also passes.)

2462
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,929
- Among the rest of you! - Good job.

2463
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,760
I know you were sad today.

2464
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:29,859
I wasn't picked.

2465
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,707
Let's have one each.

2466
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,370
- I'll give you without looking. - Okay.

2467
01:19:33,371 --> 01:19:34,399
I don't know.

2468
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,564
Jong Kook.

2469
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,423
I don't know.

2470
01:19:37,741 --> 01:19:39,340
- Why did you give it to me first? - I don't know what's in it.

2471
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:40,840
(They're very sensitive.)

2472
01:19:40,841 --> 01:19:42,139
- Why did you give it to me first? - All right.

2473
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,240
- One. - Wait.

2474
01:19:43,241 --> 01:19:44,439
Please.

2475
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,550
- 1, 2, 3. - It can be anyone.

2476
01:19:46,551 --> 01:19:48,519
(Who will do...)

2477
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:52,163
(a couple performance with Haha?)

2478
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:56,056
(Jae Seok is picked.)

2479
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,173
(Welcome, Jae Seok.)

2480
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:02,830
(Haha's partner is Jae Seok.)

2481
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,249
I knew it would be him.

2482
01:20:05,371 --> 01:20:06,800
That's amazing.

2483
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,130
This is great.

2484
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:09,370
Thank you.

2485
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,540
(We hope to see an amazing performance.)

2486
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:12,449
It'll be great with Haha.

2487
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,703
The couple performance will be...

2488
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,670
done by...

2489
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,816
- Jae Seok and Haha. - Yes.

2490
01:20:20,011 --> 01:20:21,683
Let's end it with the water bomb.

2491
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,990
- Today, Sang Yeob and... - They worked very hard.

2492
01:20:24,991 --> 01:20:26,689
Soo Hyang worked very hard.

2493
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:28,319
(You worked hard today.)

2494
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,290
I tried my best not to make Haha dance.

2495
01:20:32,291 --> 01:20:34,331
- We'll come to your performance. - We'll come to your performance.

2496
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,260
Water will fall in the count of three.

2497
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:38,820
1, 2, 3.

2498
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,800
(Splashing)

2499
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:43,372
That was a lot of water.

2500
01:20:44,301 --> 01:20:46,510
(We thank Lee Sang Yeob and Im Soo Hyang for joining us today.)

2501
01:20:46,511 --> 01:20:48,101
Thank you.

2502
01:20:48,171 --> 01:20:49,510
Thank you.

2503
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,796
- That was amazing. - Thank you.

2504
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,601
(The Devil Wears Running Shirts.)

2505
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,963
(Running shirts for the fan-meet are presented.)

2506
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,580
(Running Man members design the shirts for their fans.)

2507
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:06,785
(8 members' charms are printed on white shirts.)

2508
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:08,330
(However,)

2509
01:21:08,331 --> 01:21:12,630
(8 unidentifiable shirts are presented at the same time.)

2510
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:13,769
(Finally,)

2511
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:17,066
(the race to become a designer starts.)

2512
01:21:17,301 --> 01:21:20,269
(Their undying passion for their design)

2513
01:21:20,671 --> 01:21:22,312
(Members become extremely passionate.)

2514
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,010
(The process is dirty.)

2515
01:21:24,011 --> 01:21:25,642
(The result will be full of love.)

2516
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:28,433
(Who will win the right to design?)

2517
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,285
(The Devil Wears Running Shirts.)
