1
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:09,884
(The choreography for the group dance was revealed last week.)

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:12,814
(Everyone was shocked at the difficult choreography.)

3
00:00:12,815 --> 00:00:14,623
(If we can do it, it'll be a miracle.)

4
00:00:14,624 --> 00:00:16,724
(However, there's no giving up for these members.)

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,353
(They'll do it until they can. Their fierce training began.)

6
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:22,263
(It's Lia Kim's rescue project for these bad dancers.)

7
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:24,594
(The bad dancers will surprise you. You'll witness the "miracle" soon.)

8
00:00:24,595 --> 00:00:26,312
(And to practice dancing, they've been delaying...)

9
00:00:26,764 --> 00:00:30,263
(Let's Make Merchandise Race.)

10
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:33,773
(They'll manufacture Running Shirts with the winner's design.)

11
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:35,074
(Find hidden gold bars from your opponent's land.)

12
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:37,614
(It's Gold Hopscotch Race.)

13
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:38,674
(Name 5 great figures whose names have 4 syllables.)

14
00:00:38,675 --> 00:00:40,413
(Last week, as they faced water bombs as their penalties,)

15
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,284
(everyone looked terrible.)

16
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:46,053
(And Team Jae Seok and Ji Hyo are leading the race.)

17
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:48,084
(The design of the group shirts depends on this Merchandise Race.)

18
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:50,074
(What is the next mission?)

19
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,953
- What is this game now? - What is it?

20
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:54,193
Is it long jump or something?

21
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,750
It's a pair match again.

22
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,503
Let's just try not to be placed last this time.

23
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:58,774
(What's the mission this time?)

24
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,104
You will be able to acquire gold bars with this mission.

25
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,821
It's called Fly Super Balloons.

26
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:05,774
You will blow the balloons yourselves...

27
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:08,244
and fly them without trying them. And the team that has the balloon...

28
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:09,913
that travels the farthest will win.

29
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:13,046
The winning team will get to open two pieces of the opponent's land.

30
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:16,683
- But it's windy. - It's windy.

31
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:17,884
It's windy. Will this work?

32
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:21,424
However, before we start the game, we'll do a simple preliminary game.

33
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:25,063
The winning team can fly the balloon after taking a step forward.

34
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:26,163
- We have to win that. - We'll let you do that.

35
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,663
Kwang Soo has long legs. If he takes a step forward...

36
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:31,233
- You have long legs. - We must win this. I'm serious.

37
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:34,603
The mission for this benefit is called Speech Balloon 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

38
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:35,603
- "Speech balloon"? - What?

39
00:01:35,604 --> 00:01:37,444
Each team will take a turn to do this mission.

40
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,714
I will ask you questions. And the pair will take turns...

41
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,184
to answer the questions in 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 syllables...

42
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,144
in the order given.

43
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,014
- That's hard. - The winning pair will move a step.

44
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,913
For the 2nd ranked pair, 1 of the 2 will get the benefit.

45
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:49,570
That's how we'll grant the benefits.

46
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,124
You should go first.

47
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,724
Okay. So Min, your answer must have 5 syllables. And 4, 3, 2, 1.

48
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,163
- Does mine have 5 syllables? - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

49
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,423
- Yes. - Which one has five syllables?

50
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,423
- You first. - Okay.

51
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:58,764
- Here we go. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

52
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:01,193
Get ready. Start.

53
00:02:01,194 --> 00:02:02,749
What's your weakness?

54
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,333
I am ugly.

55
00:02:04,334 --> 00:02:05,618
What's your nickname?

56
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:07,116
It's a giraffe.

57
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,797
What's the nickname you want to give to Kwang Soo?

58
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:11,685
Poophole.

59
00:02:12,075 --> 00:02:13,274
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:15,414
(She names him Poophole as if it's the most natural thing to do.)

61
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:16,714
- I couldn't think of anything else. - Poophole?

62
00:02:16,715 --> 00:02:18,058
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:20,134
- You look like Poophole. - You do look like it.

64
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,324
- No. I mean... - You're Poophole.

65
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,054
- I didn't mean it. The syllables... - He does look like it.

66
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:25,824
- Poophole was great. - She didn't say Anus.

67
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,524
- She said Poophole. - You two are out.

68
00:02:27,525 --> 00:02:28,563
- Why... - You're out.

69
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,723
Why can't you speak?

70
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:31,794
Hey, we should try it. This is...

71
00:02:31,795 --> 00:02:32,863
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo will go next.)

72
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,258
Don't think long about this kind of game. Just blurt it out.

73
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:37,519
- Watch. - "What?"

74
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:39,904
- Watch and learn. - Let's see...

75
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:40,904
- Answer it right away. - how good he's at this game.

76
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:42,244
I'll show you this is how one thinks on his feet.

77
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,003
- He'll give ridiculous answers. - Get ready.

78
00:02:44,004 --> 00:02:45,274
Start.

79
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:46,829
What did you tell your son last night?

80
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,760
Go to sleep, Ji Ho.

81
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:50,926
What was your childhood nickname?

82
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:52,426
Dumb Idiot.

83
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:54,529
- That's possible. - Things to take to a desert island?

84
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:56,836
Tteokbokki.

85
00:02:57,254 --> 00:02:58,524
- Why would you take that? - How could you bring that there?

86
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:00,093
(Acting brazen)

87
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:01,793
(Why would you bring tteokbokki to a desert island?)

88
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,124
- I... - Lighter.

89
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:05,364
- I'm going to bring it. - Bring a lighter.

90
00:03:05,365 --> 00:03:07,415
- He's going to eat that there. - It has to make sense at least.

91
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,133
- You could've said a cellphone. - It makes no sense.

92
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:10,923
- You won't accept that again? - Why would you bring that there?

93
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,234
- You said no... - You could've said a cellphone.

94
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,486
to Im Su Yeon's fried rice.

95
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:14,774
They should do it over.

96
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,003
- Do-over. Start from the beginning. - It makes no sense.

97
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:17,973
Seriously. You guys are unbelievable.

98
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:19,732
- You'll start with five syllables. - Okay.

99
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,473
Get ready. Start.

100
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:22,727
What would you say if Se Chan asks you out?

101
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:27,584
- Should I think about it? - Really?

102
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,024
- Really? - You should say, "I'd be crazy."

103
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:30,601
What would you say if Ji Hyo wants to date you?

104
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,366
Have you gone mad?

105
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,924
That makes sense.

106
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:35,066
What's Jae Seok's nickname?

107
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:36,464
- Grasshopper. - There you go.

108
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,737
- That one was easy. - What do you do when you're happy?

109
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,307
- That one was easy. - What do you do when you're happy?

110
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,734
(Screaming)

111
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,364
(Scream when you're happy.)

112
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:45,204
- That's not acceptable. - It was about your action.

113
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:46,934
- It was about your action. - Hey.

114
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,033
- Listen. - Say hurrah or something.

115
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,603
- Hold on. - Or say hooray.

116
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,244
- That's not acceptable. - Say hurrah.

117
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:53,744
- Why isn't that acceptable? - Hurrah.

118
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:54,843
- Or smile. - That won't work.

119
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,144
- It wasn't "Oh, yes". - Or jump.

120
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,714
- Jump. That's right. - Darn it. You're too harsh.

121
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,139
- That was onomatopoeia word. - Exactly.

122
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,853
- I don't get why it's wrong. - Get ready.

123
00:04:02,854 --> 00:04:04,037
Haha will start with five syllables.

124
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,723
Start.

125
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,108
What if you don't have toilet paper in the bathroom?

126
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,079
I'm in trouble, man.

127
00:04:09,594 --> 00:04:10,705
- What? - What did you say?

128
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,163
("I'm in trouble, man"?)

129
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:14,234
"I'm in trouble, man."

130
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,234
- That's a dialect. - "I'm in trouble, man."

131
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:17,952
- Why the dialect all of a sudden? - "I'm in trouble, man."

132
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:19,103
- That can't count. - Hey.

133
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,374
- That's a dialect. - You'll create regional friction.

134
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,174
- "I'm in trouble, man." - That can't be accepted.

135
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,256
"I'm in trouble, man."

136
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,774
(You won't allow the Hamgyong Province accent?)

137
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,026
- "I'm in trouble, man." - This isn't acceptable?

138
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:30,313
- No, it's not. - This is unfair. Get me a new one.

139
00:04:30,314 --> 00:04:31,954
- That can't count. - That came out of the blue.

140
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:33,672
- That's not acceptable. - "I'm in trouble, dog."

141
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,554
This can't count either.

142
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:36,853
(This is already getting exhausting.)

143
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,253
- Do it over then. - No, no. You...

144
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:40,024
- Let's use standard Korean. - "I'm in trouble, son."

145
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:41,054
That came out of nowhere.

146
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,811
- I'll start now. - Here we go.

147
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,914
- Are you ready? - I'm ready, man.

148
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:47,144
Get ready.

149
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:48,882
Start. Do you have a girlfriend?

150
00:04:49,134 --> 00:04:50,317
I have one now.

151
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,197
(He answers without hiding anything.)

152
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:54,316
Do you know who it is?

153
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,443
I totally know.

154
00:04:55,444 --> 00:04:57,543
(I totally know.)

155
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:59,089
What will you take to a desert island?

156
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,387
Girl... Darn it.

157
00:05:01,814 --> 00:05:03,383
(Girl... Darn it.)

158
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:05,484
(He falls into the girlfriend trap.)

159
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:07,554
- Tell her that you love her! - Move.

160
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,242
(What are you saying?)

161
00:05:09,254 --> 00:05:11,554
- Se Chan has a girlfriend? - He has a girlfriend?

162
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,893
- I had no idea that he had one. - He got a girlfriend.

163
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:15,094
- Stop it. - Congratulations.

164
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:16,463
Don't get caught!

165
00:05:16,464 --> 00:05:17,637
(You're listening, right?)

166
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:20,063
Hey, Se Chan is imagining it.

167
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,347
Congratulations on your imaginary relationship.

168
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,104
Imaginary relationship?

169
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,983
- When did it start? - That came out of nowhere.

170
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:27,133
- I got so flustered. - Who's next?

171
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,346
- Should we go? - Okay.

172
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:30,344
We did well earlier too.

173
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:31,874
The chemistry between them is great.

174
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,544
- Their chemistry is great. - I'm so curious.

175
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,604
Jong Kook has met his perfect partner now.

176
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:38,037
- They're also the Monday Couple. - They make a good couple.

177
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:39,684
They're Stressful Couple.

178
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:41,301
- Jong Kook, you'll start. Yes. - Five syllables?

179
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:43,323
Get ready. Start.

180
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:44,536
What's your number one treasure?

181
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:46,608
Stuffed...

182
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,035
toy car.

183
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:50,040
- Stuffed toy car? - That's my treasure.

184
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:51,763
(What? Jong Kook likes stuffed toy cars?)

185
00:05:51,764 --> 00:05:53,755
- That's so scary. - Stuffed toy cars.

186
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,804
- You like stuffed toy cars? - Yes.

187
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:57,203
- That's my number one treasure. - That doesn't suit you.

188
00:05:57,204 --> 00:05:59,273
- Do you hug it in your sleep too? - Of course.

189
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,604
- I love stuffed toy cars. - You like stuffed toy cars.

190
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,244
- Of course. - That's adorable.

191
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:05,643
- It doesn't have to be true, right? - He has a point.

192
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:06,874
- We'll start again. - I'll go with that.

193
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,662
- I'll go first. - Get ready.

194
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:10,184
Start.

195
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:11,527
Whom do you love the most?

196
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:13,230
It's Yu Su Jeong.

197
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:16,184
(His romantic line sounds calculated.)

198
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,144
Whom do you hate the most?

199
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:21,554
- Jee Seok Jin... - Jee Seok Jin.

200
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:24,563
(Everyone heard Seok Jin's name clearly.)

201
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:25,934
That makes sense.

202
00:06:25,935 --> 00:06:26,934
Jee Seok Jin.

203
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:28,133
- Jee Seok Jin. - That works.

204
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,448
- Jee Seok Jin. - Let's go with that.

205
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,677
- It works. - Right.

206
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:32,474
- Hey, Jee Seok Jin. - It works.

207
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,848
- You'll be casual now, right? - This works.

208
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:35,974
- They dropped honorifics now. - That's upsetting.

209
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,763
- Jee Seok Jin. - It's upsetting.

210
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,344
We'll start from four syllables again.

211
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,073
- Yes, have a do-over. - Okay, let's do it again.

212
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:43,114
Get ready. Start.

213
00:06:43,115 --> 00:06:44,559
What would you say to your ex-girlfriend?

214
00:06:44,884 --> 00:06:45,925
Sorry for everything.

215
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:49,984
(He longingly whispers, "Sorry for everything".)

216
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,237
- That's sad. - Hold on.

217
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,806
What do you say when you confess your love?

218
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,523
I love you so...

219
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:56,281
You could've said, "I love you".

220
00:06:56,495 --> 00:06:58,023
(Stuttering)

221
00:06:58,024 --> 00:06:59,534
(He could've gone with "I love you".)

222
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,776
I needed three syllables.

223
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,954
- My gosh. - He's so frustrating.

224
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:04,475
- Come on! - Get out.

225
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:06,191
- Sorry, but get out of the seat. - Get out.

226
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:07,818
- Get out. - Get out, man.

227
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:09,443
- Seok Jin, go over there. - Get out.

228
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:11,573
- I didn't know it was three. - Go over there.

229
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:13,393
- We'll start with five syllables. - Let's try this again.

230
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,583
Get ready. Start.

231
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,028
Where would you like to go with So Min?

232
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:18,997
My...

233
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,396
- "My"? - "My"?

234
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:23,448
(That's the place he wants to go with So Min?)

235
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,710
- Is that "my house"? - It's a game.

236
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,124
- "My house"? - You're out.

237
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,494
- I can't come up with an answer. - Why can't you?

238
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,924
- What could I have said? - Take it easy.

239
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:32,016
- Paju Heyri. - Yes, "my apartment".

240
00:07:32,194 --> 00:07:34,234
"My mom's house". There are many possible answers.

241
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,821
- All right. Next team. - Ji Hyo will go first.

242
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,403
Watch me.

243
00:07:37,404 --> 00:07:38,717
There's a winning method for this game.

244
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:39,915
"There's a winning method."

245
00:07:40,134 --> 00:07:42,203
Since I'm very good at improvising,

246
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:43,943
- you must play along. - Jae Seok.

247
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,244
- Who has to play along? - Your improvised lines are short.

248
00:07:45,245 --> 00:07:46,427
Do you mean "tteokbokki"?

249
00:07:46,714 --> 00:07:47,825
Mr. Tteokbokki.

250
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,044
- Mr. Tteokbokki. Play along what? - Listen.

251
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,731
- You're too uptight. - Here we go.

252
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,507
Get ready. Start.

253
00:07:53,884 --> 00:07:55,501
What's the lie you tell the most?

254
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,442
What did you do yesterday?

255
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:00,453
- What was that? - What? Why did you ask a question?

256
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,294
(The lie he tells the most is "What did you do yesterday?")

257
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,724
(Why did you ask a question?)

258
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:06,934
- His improvised lines are terrible. - He's terrible at this game.

259
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:08,693
- What's up with your answers? - What's wrong with you?

260
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:11,088
- His answer was weird. - Hold on.

261
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:13,022
- Hear me out. - Are you nervous, Jae Seok?

262
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,674
- What's wrong with your answer? - It's not that.

263
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:16,073
- Are you nervous? - You lie about that question?

264
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:17,474
- I must have a do-over. - No.

265
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,573
Ji Hyo didn't get to answer one.

266
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,174
What are you talking about? You should start with her first.

267
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,790
- That was the worst answer! - Listen.

268
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,501
- I didn't prepare my answer. Sorry. - Exactly.

269
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:26,013
- I didn't prepare five syllables. - It's because you're nervous.

270
00:08:26,014 --> 00:08:28,554
- Ji Hyo will go first. - Okay, okay.

271
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,284
By the way, Jae Seok is awful at this.

272
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,554
Hail to the king of improvisation.

273
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,271
- Anyway, he's bad at this. - Look at the king of improvisation.

274
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,312
I'm telling you.

275
00:08:35,394 --> 00:08:37,243
- We're to play along to that? - Watch me.

276
00:08:37,324 --> 00:08:39,333
Get ready. Start.

277
00:08:39,334 --> 00:08:40,608
What will you do when you get 10 million dollars?

278
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:43,463
I'll buy a house and land.

279
00:08:43,464 --> 00:08:44,664
- Okay. - What did you say...

280
00:08:44,665 --> 00:08:45,685
when you proposed?

281
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:47,946
What should we do?

282
00:08:48,035 --> 00:08:49,388
Come on. What was that?

283
00:08:49,475 --> 00:08:51,874
(He asked, "What should we do?" when he proposed to his wife?)

284
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,530
- Hold on. It makes no sense. - Wait.

285
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,563
- That was pathetic. - Listen. Hold on.

286
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,013
- That was so pathetic. - "What should we do?"

287
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,044
How does that make sense?

288
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,453
- Hold on. - This makes no sense.

289
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,414
- What doesn't this make sense? - What was that?

290
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,224
No one can understand where I'm coming from?

291
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:05,173
- "What should we do?" - You can't understand it?

292
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,971
- "What should we do?" - It's a riddle.

293
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,523
It's hard to say this in four syllables.

294
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:11,724
Hey, Jae Seok.

295
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,189
You said you were the king. You told us to watch and learn.

296
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:16,164
Seriously.

297
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,604
All right. Let's do this, Jong Kook.

298
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:19,434
Let's do this. When they're not doing well,

299
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,585
we should win this.

300
00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:22,219
I can't believe we're doing this again.

301
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:23,374
- We'll keep getting our turns. - I already gave up on it.

302
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,773
Hey, do your best.

303
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:26,214
Everyone, do better than this.

304
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:27,474
- Get ready. Five syllables first. - Let's go.

305
00:09:27,475 --> 00:09:28,485
- Me? - Get ready.

306
00:09:28,674 --> 00:09:30,844
Start.

307
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,097
Where do you want to go for your vacation?

308
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:33,730
It's LA.

309
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,269
How do you feel when you watch our show?

310
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,236
I'm very good.

311
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:38,566
What will you do if you get 10 million dollars?

312
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,244
I'll buy a car.

313
00:09:41,325 --> 00:09:43,345
What do you think when you look at a mirror?

314
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,377
I'm handsome.

315
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:48,834
(For the first time, it's time to answer with one syllable.)

316
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,663
(If Jong Kook can answer with one syllable,)

317
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:52,352
(Seok Jin and Jong Kook will get the benefit.)

318
00:09:53,174 --> 00:09:54,273
What did you do yesterday?

319
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,403
Sleep.

320
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:57,344
("What did you do yesterday?" "Sleep")

321
00:09:57,345 --> 00:10:00,405
(With a neat answer, they will be ranked 1st.)

322
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,457
Great!

323
00:10:02,715 --> 00:10:03,755
What about my high-five?

324
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:06,379
(Jong Kook skips the high-five.)

325
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:08,883
(Their playful chemistry is getting funnier.)

326
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:09,883
I'm not that happy,

327
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,298
but I have to act I'm happy.

328
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:12,365
Why aren't you happy?

329
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:14,772
- All right. Next time. - It's our turn.

330
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:16,624
Get ready. Start.

331
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,194
What's your best dish at your barbecue restaurant?

332
00:10:18,195 --> 00:10:19,346
Pork belly and entrails.

333
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:20,746
What's your pet name for your girlfriend?

334
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:23,378
Can you not ask about my girlfriend?

335
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:24,875
Seriously.

336
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,334
(It's breaking his heart.)

337
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,324
- That question flusters me. - Listen.

338
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:31,657
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

339
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,759
Why do you make up an imaginary girlfriend?

340
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,643
- He's teasing me. - Listen.

341
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,413
How can he have a pet name when he doesn't have a girlfriend?

342
00:10:37,414 --> 00:10:38,744
How can he have a pet name?

343
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,883
Say something like Alien.

344
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,612
What? Alien? Why would that be Alien?

345
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,183
- Why would I do that? - Just do it.

346
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:46,023
- Just go with me. - This is upsetting.

347
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,670
- Alien. - Whenever he asks about that...

348
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:50,720
- My gosh, this is so frustrating. - You can say "green frog".

349
00:10:50,764 --> 00:10:52,653
- Who will go 1st? Here it goes. - I'll go 1st.

350
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,846
Get ready.

351
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:55,704
Start.

352
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,846
Who's your ideal type?

353
00:10:57,304 --> 00:10:58,445
Handsome guys.

354
00:10:58,634 --> 00:10:59,746
What's your pet name for your girlfriend?

355
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,903
(Hesitating)

356
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,003
- Answer it. - Come on.

357
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:04,418
- Answer it! - Just answer it!

358
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,906
(As he can't bring himself to answer it, he only mouths it.)

359
00:11:08,475 --> 00:11:10,283
- Why didn't you answer that? - Is she his imaginary girlfriend?

360
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,183
- Why didn't you answer it? - Hey. Are you...

361
00:11:12,184 --> 00:11:13,629
- bragging in front of Se Chan? - Exactly.

362
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:16,354
(Are you bragging in front of a guy with an imaginary girlfriend?)

363
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,423
- What was that? - You know?

364
00:11:17,424 --> 00:11:19,553
- He's teasing me too. - Exactly.

365
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,324
He's trying so hard to come up with one...

366
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,694
- when he has no one. - This is driving me crazy.

367
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,735
Cutie Pie.

368
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,714
- That's a pet name. - There are other names.

369
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:26,933
What was that?

370
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,194
It must have four syllables.

371
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,864
You could've said, Giraffe's Girlfriend.

372
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:30,903
- Get out. - It's our turn.

373
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:32,163
(I'll show you.)

374
00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:34,273
- Here's the king of improvisation. - Don't you worry.

375
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:35,574
- The king of improvisation. - Get ready to play along.

376
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,773
Listen.

377
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,824
If you don't accept my answer, I'll angry.

378
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,773
(What kind of improvised lines will the king say?)

379
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:41,886
- Jae Seok. - Get ready.

380
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,136
Start. What was your childhood dream job?

381
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,074
- It was a comedian. - Right.

382
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,683
- "It was a comedian." - Okay.

383
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,441
- He had a hard time. - That was slow.

384
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,766
What was your childhood nickname?

385
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,871
Dumb Idiot.

386
00:11:54,024 --> 00:11:55,438
What lullaby do you want to sing for your son?

387
00:11:55,725 --> 00:11:56,735
"I Love You".

388
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:59,964
(He's barely surviving with vague answers.)

389
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,106
What's your boyfriend's nickname?

390
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:02,815
Honey.

391
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:05,673
(Thanks to Ji Hyo, they have a chance to complete the game.)

392
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:08,604
(The king of improvisation must answer it with one syllable.)

393
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,372
(Will this team be able to succeed?)

394
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:12,525
What was your childhood dream job?

395
00:12:13,914 --> 00:12:14,986
Poop!

396
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:17,084
That was true.

397
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,013
(Korea's favorite MC's dream job was being poop.)

398
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:20,064
That was true.

399
00:12:20,085 --> 00:12:21,454
- That was true. - No, no.

400
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:22,738
- Why not? - We can't count this.

401
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,084
- This one is true. - Come on. You can't grow up...

402
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:25,569
- to become poop. It makes no sense. - Listen.

403
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:27,594
- Come on. - We can't count this one.

404
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:28,806
- Why not? - This can't count.

405
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:31,364
- We can't accept this answer. - That was my childhood dream job!

406
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:33,213
- You could've said, "You". - We can't count that.

407
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,254
- "You". Right. - "Him". "Her".

408
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:39,074
I can deal with other members telling me that my answer was bad,

409
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,448
- but you can't do that. - Why not?

410
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,173
- Why not? - I don't deserve it from you.

411
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:44,589
(Lack of Quick Thinking versus Lack of Imagination)

412
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,744
Here we go.

413
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,444
- Is it me first? - This is confusing.

414
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:50,913
Ready, set, go.

415
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,359
You farted in the bus, right?

416
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,553
Yes, a bit.

417
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,766
When did you date for the last time?

418
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:57,339
Two days ago.

419
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:59,142
He tries so hard to lie.

420
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,824
What would you like to tell your wife?

421
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:01,905
I love you.

422
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,094
What's your girlfriend's nickname?

423
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:04,364
Earlobe.

424
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,577
This is right!

425
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,064
(Se Chan's fake girlfriend's nickname is Earlobe.)

426
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:10,464
- What's wrong with it? - This isn't right.

427
00:13:10,465 --> 00:13:11,734
- Don't do this. - It doesn't make sense.

428
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,234
He's trying so hard.

429
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:14,503
Are her earlobes long?

430
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:15,903
- It should... - Are they?

431
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:17,303
- It should make some sense. - Her earlobes...

432
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,814
Her earlobes are this long.

433
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:22,143
- Earlobes. - It's a nickname.

434
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:23,543
- "Dear Earlobe". - We should acknowledge this.

435
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,013
- Why is it wrong? - Fine.

436
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,084
- What's wrong with it? - "Dear Earlobe".

437
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,125
We have one more.

438
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:29,253
- We're using our imaginations. - We'll go again.

439
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:31,053
We'll start with the two-syllable answer again.

440
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:33,014
(He successfully gets another chance.)

441
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,326
(If they win 2 more times, they'll come 2nd place.)

442
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,806
Who's your favorite historical figure?

443
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,194
Historical figure?

444
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:41,994
- Hey. - A historical figure?

445
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,503
(He was thinking about his girlfriend.)

446
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:45,485
(Surprised)

447
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,374
(It wasn't the genre he expected.)

448
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,933
Come on. Goodness.

449
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,995
(He fails to give an answer.)

450
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,773
- A historical figure. - Why me?

451
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,543
Why me?

452
00:13:54,544 --> 00:13:56,114
(This was a difficult question for him.)

453
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:58,114
- It's all right. Good job. - Goodness.

454
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,984
You know how I am when I get flustered, right?

455
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:02,408
You know, right? Right?

456
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,324
Why are they so bad?

457
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:06,594
How long will we do this for?

458
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,574
- The sun is setting. - Let's get this over with!

459
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,364
- That was an easy question. - I was flustered.

460
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:12,964
- You could've said, "Haha". - Or "mother".

461
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:14,307
- Or "My something". - Right.

462
00:14:14,634 --> 00:14:16,018
Are you good at this game?

463
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,903
(You're so talkative.)

464
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:22,258
- Sir, are you that good? - Listen.

465
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,173
- He's the king of improvision. - I improvise things.

466
00:14:24,174 --> 00:14:25,173
- He's the king. - Is that so?

467
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:26,629
- I'm that awesome. - I see.

468
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,844
- Let's start. - No one approves, though.

469
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,744
- Ready, set, go. - Kwang Soo goes first.

470
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,764
Why did you go to Japan?

471
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:34,354
It was a trip.

472
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:35,923
- Don't you dare lie. - I was going to say that.

473
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:38,124
- What was that answer? - "I was In Sung's butler."

474
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,053
(He was In Sung's butler.)

475
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:43,464
(As In Sung's butler, Kwang Soo went to Japan.)

476
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,181
What do you mean? We went on a trip!

477
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,433
- It was a trip. - "To make money".

478
00:14:47,434 --> 00:14:49,503
- What do you mean? - You're so frustrating.

479
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,150
We'll do the five-syllable answer again.

480
00:14:51,804 --> 00:14:52,845
Ready,

481
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,104
set, go.

482
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,604
How did you feel after returning from Japan?

483
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,944
I felt great.

484
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,258
What's your favorite dish?

485
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,614
- Omurice. - What's...

486
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:01,844
- That's wrong. - Those were five syllables.

487
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:03,543
You should've said, "kimchi stew".

488
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:04,744
- "Omurice"? - Come on.

489
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,084
- Why can't you count? - "Omrice".

490
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,183
- "Omrice". - Get out.

491
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:08,699
- That's wrong. - It's English.

492
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:11,183
(This won't end anytime soon.)

493
00:15:11,184 --> 00:15:12,468
- Ready, - He's good.

494
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:13,854
set, go.

495
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,813
What do you think of when you see your wife every day?

496
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:18,817
"You're so pretty."

497
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,834
- "You're so pretty." - "You're so pretty."

498
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:22,410
Which historical figure do you admire the most?

499
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:24,544
Sejong the Great.

500
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,503
(He gets the question right.)

501
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:27,848
Whom do you dislike the most?

502
00:15:28,134 --> 00:15:29,558
That scumbag.

503
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,104
(He hates...)

504
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:33,173
(the interviewer.)

505
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:34,814
(Director Cheol Min)

506
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,098
No, wait.

507
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:37,828
That wasn't what I meant.

508
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,053
- What was that? - I'm sorry.

509
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:41,454
- Haha. - He meant it.

510
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:42,984
- How could you? - I'm sorry.

511
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,084
- That was so harsh. - I didn't mean it.

512
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,454
- You could've said a name. - I was...

513
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:47,954
trying to make it witty.

514
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,339
I should've just said, "Jung Cheol Min".

515
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,023
- We'll do it again. - Do it again.

516
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,913
- We'll do three syllables again. - Okay.

517
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,994
- Yes. - Don't get hurt.

518
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,033
Ready, set, go.

519
00:15:57,034 --> 00:15:58,564
What do you look like the most?

520
00:15:58,565 --> 00:15:59,704
Kim Go Eun.

521
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,047
(That's his wife's name.)

522
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:03,089
(Right, you do look alike.)

523
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,515
What's your nickname?

524
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:05,944
Pauper.

525
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,944
(He criticizes himself in order to win.)

526
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,013
(Will Haha succeed?)

527
00:16:11,014 --> 00:16:12,024
What was your dream as a kid?

528
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:13,426
The best.

529
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:14,695
You did it!

530
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:18,354
(Haha and Se Chan succeed.)

531
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,413
- That was brilliant. - It worked.

532
00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:22,994
How could you be so shameless when saying, "pauper"?

533
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:24,034
It's in my imagination.

534
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,763
- We did it. - I'm a pauper.

535
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:27,464
The last question was hard.

536
00:16:27,465 --> 00:16:28,893
- "The best". - Okay.

537
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:32,137
The winning team can take one step closer...

538
00:16:32,264 --> 00:16:34,173
when flying the balloons. The second team will...

539
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:35,474
That's what we're doing?

540
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:36,543
(We're still on that?)

541
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,444
- We're still doing that? - We are?

542
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:39,513
We're not taking each other's lands?

543
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:41,844
- We're not taking their land. - What is this?

544
00:16:41,845 --> 00:16:43,835
This was the longest game we had today!

545
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,043
It was a preliminary game.

546
00:16:45,044 --> 00:16:46,771
- It was the most exhausting. - Goodness.

547
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:49,512
- They still got an advantage. - Right.

548
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:51,423
The team with...

549
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:54,094
- the farthest balloon will win. - It's so windy.

550
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:55,324
- Do we only get one chance? - We should use the wind.

551
00:16:55,325 --> 00:16:56,494
That's right.

552
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:57,663
(They need to use the wind.)

553
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:59,614
- Haha. - Me? Okay.

554
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:01,713
(Haha will go first.)

555
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:04,485
(He blows it as big as possible.)

556
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,285
You're good.

557
00:17:06,705 --> 00:17:08,133
- You can take a step forward. - Okay.

558
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,133
Okay.

559
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,316
You should blow on it more.

560
00:17:10,475 --> 00:17:11,574
It's windy.

561
00:17:11,575 --> 00:17:13,190
- It is. - It's quite windy.

562
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,264
The wind might change the balloon's direction.

563
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,143
(He pretends to test the wind.)

564
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,640
You should do it now. The wind is blowing forward.

565
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:22,735
(Flying)

566
00:17:23,424 --> 00:17:25,001
- Hey, hey! - Nice!

567
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:28,553
(Haha lets go of the balloon.)

568
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,281
- Nice! - It went far.

569
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,824
Haha.

570
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:32,893
(It's over 7m.)

571
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:34,854
(He's content.)

572
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,822
It bounced off my head.

573
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:43,496
(The balloon fell on So Min's head and bounced off.)

574
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:44,773
- Haha. - That went far.

575
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:45,773
(It's all thanks to So Min.)

576
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,874
- Good! - 7m and 40cm.

577
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,329
Okay! That's great.

578
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:50,814
Go, So Min.

579
00:17:50,815 --> 00:17:52,283
Taking one step forward is a huge advantage.

580
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,577
I wish I could do that.

581
00:17:55,014 --> 00:17:57,751
- It's so windy. - I think mine will go right.

582
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:59,197
- Should I let go right now? - Yes.

583
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,746
(She lets go while the wind is blowing forward.)

584
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,223
- Should I let go right now? - Yes.

585
00:18:04,224 --> 00:18:06,214
(Flying)

586
00:18:06,494 --> 00:18:07,663
(After flying around aimlessly,)

587
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,034
(it lands on the 1m mark.)

588
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,433
It was so weak.

589
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,444
(Discouraged)

590
00:18:12,204 --> 00:18:14,599
(The wind stopped blowing the moment she let go.)

591
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:16,743
- It was so weak. - Why was your balloon so weak?

592
00:18:16,744 --> 00:18:18,866
- I thought it was a blowfish. - Your team did well.

593
00:18:19,575 --> 00:18:21,743
- 40cm. - 42cm.

594
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:23,443
- Goodness. - Why did it go sideways? Why?

595
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:25,061
I think it'll explode.

596
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:27,314
We're not sure if blowing on it will help it fly farther.

597
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,930
- Step forward. - It might actually backfire.

598
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:31,324
That's good. You should lower it.

599
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:32,524
- Lower it? - Yes.

600
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,716
Taking a step forward is a big advantage.

601
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:36,993
Good.

602
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:38,693
(What?)

603
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:40,594
(Why is the balloon rising?)

604
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:41,633
Good.

605
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,004
- Good. - It hit something!

606
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:44,953
(The balloon flies up high.)

607
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:47,122
Good. That's good. Okay.

608
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:48,774
- Oh, no. - Are we still winning?

609
00:18:48,775 --> 00:18:49,856
Haha, tell me.

610
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,604
Mine went slightly farther.

611
00:18:51,605 --> 00:18:52,643
It's neck and neck.

612
00:18:52,644 --> 00:18:55,044
- It's a tight match. - We should leave it there.

613
00:18:55,045 --> 00:18:57,213
(Did Seok Jin beat Haha?)

614
00:18:57,214 --> 00:18:58,784
- Haha's was 35cm? - No.

615
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,713
(Seok Jin's balloon is 5cm short.)

616
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:03,785
(Haha, with 7m and 40cm, is still in 1st place.)

617
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,368
- There's no wind right now. - Do it now.

618
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:08,624
(It starts off great,)

619
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,864
It's going so far.

620
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,510
(but plummets.)

621
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:15,034
(Ji Hyo's balloon went 5m and 30cm.)

622
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:16,364
5m and 30cm.

623
00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:17,677
- That was far. - It was.

624
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:19,016
Do it now!

625
00:19:19,065 --> 00:19:20,233
I can take one step forward, right?

626
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:21,316
(Se Chan has a chance to step forward.)

627
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:25,140
- Good luck, Earlobe! - Go, Earlobe!

628
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:27,014
(He fails to focus.)

629
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:28,673
- Come on. - Her earlobes are this long, right?

630
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:29,913
- Right. - Yes.

631
00:19:29,914 --> 00:19:31,483
- It'll be... - She has Buddha's earlobes.

632
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:33,374
It'll be obvious no matter where she goes.

633
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,569
Let go when the wind blows.

634
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:36,966
Right now.

635
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,054
It's so weak.

636
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:40,508
(It flies without much strength.)

637
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,315
- What is that? - Goodness.

638
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,006
What was that?

639
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,479
- Let go when the wind blows. - I knew it.

640
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,703
(What?)

641
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:51,553
(It's flying quite fast.)

642
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,733
(It shoots forward.)

643
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,203
- It's going backwards. - It's going backwards.

644
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:56,473
It's so weak.

645
00:19:56,474 --> 00:19:58,004
(Disappointed)

646
00:19:58,005 --> 00:20:00,344
- The yellow ones have issues. - There's something wrong.

647
00:20:00,345 --> 00:20:01,814
Our balloons are odd.

648
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:03,763
- The yellow ones are weird. - Why are they so weak?

649
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:05,599
Jae Seok's balloon is huge.

650
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,502
- It is. - Pop it.

651
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:08,766
Pop it, please.

652
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:10,784
Bite it with your front teeth and pop it.

653
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:11,866
Done.

654
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:13,407
The direction is what matters.

655
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,447
(All he needs is good wind.)

656
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:17,923
(What?)

657
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,564
(What?)

658
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,150
- What? - What is that?

659
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,019
- What? - What is that?

660
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,965
(What has happened?)

661
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:33,074
(To everyone's disbelief,)

662
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,514
(the balloon passes 10m...)

663
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,665
(and 15m.)

664
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:43,707
(It flies past 15m.)

665
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:49,254
(He's the master of flying balloons.)

666
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,542
- What was that? - Jae Seok!

667
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:54,410
How is that possible?

668
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:56,163
- You're amazing. - This is impossible.

669
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:57,504
- The wind helped. - This is absurd.

670
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:59,334
The wind blew midway.

671
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,334
Since he's teamed up with Ji Hyo, he's become lucky now.

672
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,574
I've become lucky.

673
00:21:03,575 --> 00:21:05,443
- The wind blew midway. - He's lucky.

674
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:08,404
I'm pretty sure they're the winners.

675
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,561
Jong Kook isn't good at these games.

676
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:13,339
(Jong Kook has yet to compete.)

677
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:16,212
(Jae Seok's record is by far the highest.)

678
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,524
(His balloon is 16m away.)

679
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:20,493
(However, Jong Kook is competent.)

680
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:21,969
(He clenches his teeth.)

681
00:21:22,694 --> 00:21:24,644
Oh, yes!

682
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:26,024
What?

683
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:27,853
(What is this?)

684
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:29,663
Yes!

685
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,219
(He comes 2nd to last.)

686
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,604
Goodness.

687
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:34,774
(We see a weak side of him.)

688
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:37,228
- He's not the type to do this. - I know.

689
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,713
Jong Kook looks so stressed.

690
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:41,614
- This is... - Even he failed.

691
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,314
Yours was weak.

692
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:44,557
- Good job, Jae Seok. - We did it.

693
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,614
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo acquire 2 Purchase Cards)

694
00:21:46,615 --> 00:21:49,383
Now, we'll start the territory game.

695
00:21:49,384 --> 00:21:51,000
(Will Jae Seok and Ji Hyo acquire the gold bars?)

696
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,723
We'll start now.

697
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:54,824
Okay.

698
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,784
Should we choose 30 dollars or 20 dollars?

699
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:58,723
- It's the same. - It doesn't matter.

700
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:00,264
- Just open both. - You can just open both.

701
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,733
You're going to open one of Kwang Soo's anyway.

702
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:02,764
- Right. - Right.

703
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:03,903
(The target has already been decided.)

704
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:05,203
Can they open all of them?

705
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,951
(Kwang Soo and So Min...)

706
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,595
(placed 6 of their gold bars in 1 territory.)

707
00:22:10,444 --> 00:22:12,844
(Jae Seok opened Kwang Soo's 1st...)

708
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,935
(and 2nd territories.)

709
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:18,477
(They're left with only 3 territories.)

710
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:22,010
Do you think they placed them in 20 dollars?

711
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:23,997
Gold bars? Dud?

712
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,054
Since they're both ours, let's open 20 dollars.

713
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,246
- You could open both. - It could be in 30 dollars.

714
00:22:29,325 --> 00:22:30,824
- Okay, 20 dollars. - 20 dollars.

715
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:31,824
- 20 dollars? - Yes.

716
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:33,955
- There's no dud. - 20 dollars, please.

717
00:22:34,664 --> 00:22:35,794
I'll give you one last chance.

718
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:37,933
- 20 dollars. - 20 dollars. Number 4.

719
00:22:37,934 --> 00:22:39,034
(Just open it.)

720
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,318
They must've put all of them in one place.

721
00:22:40,404 --> 00:22:42,092
- I'll reveal it now. - 1, 2, 3.

722
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:43,844
(If they get the 6 gold bars, they'll be winning with 8 of them.)

723
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:46,104
I'm certain there are gold bars in there.

724
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:48,539
(Will number 4 contain the bonanza?)

725
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,544
(They hit the jackpot.)

726
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:53,595
Jae Seok!

727
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:55,614
They're way ahead of the rest of us.

728
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:56,923
(We made the wrong choice.)

729
00:22:56,924 --> 00:22:58,153
They put them all in there.

730
00:22:58,154 --> 00:22:59,324
(Jae Seok and Ji Hyo get six more gold bars.)

731
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:02,526
If we were them, we would've spent 50 dollars right away.

732
00:23:03,325 --> 00:23:04,893
They saved 30 dollars and got the gold bars.

733
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,264
Jae Seok!

734
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,433
You have one more chance.

735
00:23:07,434 --> 00:23:09,181
- Right, we do. - Yes.

736
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:10,903
Okay, okay.

737
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:12,504
- We have another chance. - Please choose us.

738
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:13,903
- Just once. - Please?

739
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:16,173
- Why? - If we get a dud,

740
00:23:16,174 --> 00:23:18,274
- They'll get a gold bar. - we have to give them one.

741
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:20,074
Then let's pick theirs.

742
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:21,730
- Thank you. - We might get a dud.

743
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:23,483
- I forgot where it was. - I forgot too.

744
00:23:23,484 --> 00:23:25,014
- I don't remember anything. - It was done randomly,

745
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:26,256
so we have no idea.

746
00:23:26,654 --> 00:23:27,653
Which one should I pick?

747
00:23:27,654 --> 00:23:29,014
(Their territories have not been opened yet.)

748
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:30,653
I pick number 1 for 10 dollars.

749
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:31,824
- Number 1. - Number 1?

750
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,094
- Pick that one. - Number one.

751
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:34,640
- 1, 2... - Ji Hyo wants number 1.

752
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:36,024
(They have a chance to gain more gold bars.)

753
00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:37,035
I'm curious.

754
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:40,121
(What's beneath the 1st territory?)

755
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,738
(They find 2 more gold bars.)

756
00:23:44,765 --> 00:23:45,834
- Did we put gold bars here? - It was there?

757
00:23:45,835 --> 00:23:47,433
What's wrong with them?

758
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,604
They get 100 dollars.

759
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:49,903
What's gotten into them?

760
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:51,844
- I can't believe this. - This is boring now.

761
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:54,238
- They're winning by far. - I know.

762
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:58,084
This mission is called Our Balloon Link.

763
00:23:58,085 --> 00:23:59,125
This is hard.

764
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:01,814
(They win again.)

765
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,865
Here!

766
00:24:04,384 --> 00:24:05,839
Okay!

767
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:06,953
Gosh!

768
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:08,554
Their record is 1 minute and 35 seconds.

769
00:24:08,555 --> 00:24:09,824
(They may be boring, but they're strong.)

770
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,440
- They came first place. - Again?

771
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:12,993
- They did. - Again?

772
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,246
- Let's choose this one. - We don't need that one.

773
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:15,633
- Also... - Please.

774
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:16,963
(When picking out the territory,)

775
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:18,703
(they hit the jackpot once again.)

776
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,594
Darn it!

777
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:22,604
Jae Seok and Ji Hyo win.

778
00:24:22,605 --> 00:24:23,903
(Stupefied)

779
00:24:23,904 --> 00:24:26,742
Haha and Se Chan came last.

780
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,514
- Our faces will be on the back. - It's actually better.

781
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:30,913
- Is it? - I preferred that anyway.

782
00:24:30,914 --> 00:24:32,814
- All right. - It's all thanks to Ji Hyo.

783
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:36,047
Let's see their designs.

784
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,423
- I don't like them. - Ji Hyo's is okay.

785
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,754
- Let's go with hers. - I like Ji Hyo's.

786
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:43,594
- I like her idea. - It's amazing.

787
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:46,695
The winning team is Jae Seok and Ji Hyo.

788
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,733
One of them will be chosen to design the Running T-Shirt...

789
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:52,463
for the fan-meet through a mission called...

790
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:54,604
100 or General.

791
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:55,903
- What is that? - What is that?

792
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:59,403
(100 or General)

793
00:24:59,404 --> 00:25:01,014
(They thought it was over.)

794
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:02,574
- What does 100 mean? - What is that?

795
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:04,014
- What is that? - It's a number.

796
00:25:04,015 --> 00:25:05,731
This game just won't end.

797
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,511
You'll flip a coin. 100 is on 1 side...

798
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:11,284
- My gosh. - 100 is on 1 side...

799
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,393
- and the general is on the other. - Gosh.

800
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:15,980
You made the mission sound so intense.

801
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,594
This is such a simple game.

802
00:25:18,595 --> 00:25:21,094
- Come on. - 100 or General.

803
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:22,163
- Everything was in vain. - It really...

804
00:25:22,164 --> 00:25:23,534
- was. - It was all in vain.

805
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:25,534
- I'm glad we lost. - Me too.

806
00:25:25,535 --> 00:25:27,595
This is like rock-paper-scissors.

807
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:31,232
What difference is this to rock-paper-scissors?

808
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:32,374
What should we do?

809
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,614
Pick which side of the coin you want.

810
00:25:34,615 --> 00:25:36,014
- Do you want the general? - Se Chan asked if...

811
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:37,743
it was 100 or genie.

812
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:41,693
(Se Chan asked if it's either 100 or genie.)

813
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:44,124
(When the mission was introduced,)

814
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,487
(he didn't recognize the word "general".)

815
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:49,624
"Genie"?

816
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:51,564
- Earlobe, what's wrong with you? - Earlobe.

817
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:53,141
- I should wake up. - It's a cute nickname.

818
00:25:53,164 --> 00:25:55,463
Who picked 100?

819
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:56,903
Which one do you want?

820
00:25:56,904 --> 00:25:59,490
Who's going to pick the number, and who's going to pick 100.

821
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,274
That's the same side.

822
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:04,678
(Make a decision.)

823
00:26:04,704 --> 00:26:06,274
That's the same side.

824
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:07,473
He said the same thing.

825
00:26:07,474 --> 00:26:09,614
- What is this? General? - It's number and general.

826
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:10,814
- Hero. - General Yi Sun Sin.

827
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,284
General Yi Sun Sin.

828
00:26:12,285 --> 00:26:14,354
It's not "hero". It's "general".

829
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,354
- Got it? - Okay.

830
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,707
- They're different. - You deserve that.

831
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,723
- My gosh. - It's either General Yi Sun Sin...

832
00:26:20,724 --> 00:26:22,723
- Right, or 100. - or 100.

833
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,163
I'll choose 100.

834
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:25,893
Okay, then I'll choose the general.

835
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:27,834
- If Jae Seok wins... - Hey.

836
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,834
- Let it be 100. - Let the coin drop.

837
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:31,203
Please let it be 100.

838
00:26:31,204 --> 00:26:33,274
- 100 is the best for us too. - If it turns out to be 100,

839
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:34,604
- I'll be amazed at her luck. - Let it be the number!

840
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,544
Let it be the number. It's much better.

841
00:26:36,545 --> 00:26:37,544
(3,000 t-shirts' design depends on this coin.)

842
00:26:37,545 --> 00:26:40,574
- Number - Number

843
00:26:40,575 --> 00:26:43,817
1, 2, 3.

844
00:26:44,214 --> 00:26:47,043
(The coin has been tossed.)

845
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,653
(If 100 comes out,)

846
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:50,223
(a design stating that anyone could become a Running Man member...)

847
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:51,770
(will be chosen.)

848
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:54,223
(If the general comes out,)

849
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,851
("The Avengers And Gung Ye" will be chosen.)

850
00:26:57,295 --> 00:27:01,133
(Which design will get picked?)

851
00:27:02,464 --> 00:27:06,141
(The day after the shooting, Sangam SBS)

852
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,203
Hello.

853
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:09,604
(Kwang Soo arrives at the dressing room first.)

854
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:10,804
Good morning.

855
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:12,643
(He looks anxious.)

856
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:13,827
What is it?

857
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:15,713
- Hello. - Hello.

858
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:16,814
- Hello. - Hello.

859
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,310
- Hello. - Hello. We're starting right away.

860
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,358
(What is this?)

861
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:25,201
What is this? Is this my head?

862
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,554
Yes.

863
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:28,513
(What is this? Is this my head?)

864
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,824
- It's Groot's head. - Right.

865
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:34,364
(That means...)

866
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,463
One...

867
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,733
(Ji Hyo versus Jae Seok)

868
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:40,129
(The outcome of 100 or General is...)

869
00:27:41,605 --> 00:27:44,837
(General Yi Sun Sin.)

870
00:27:45,204 --> 00:27:47,639
(Jae Seok's design is chosen.)

871
00:27:47,714 --> 00:27:49,173
(This is bad.)

872
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:50,314
No one's reacting.

873
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,183
To Jae Seok, the winner,

874
00:27:52,184 --> 00:27:55,114
we will give him the right to design the 3,000 t-shirts...

875
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,124
for the fan-meet.

876
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,723
("The Avengers And Gung Ye")

877
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:02,824
(Kwang Soo will be dressed up as Groot.)

878
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,693
I can't believe everything's ready in one day.

879
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:05,977
(He wishes it didn't happen.)

880
00:28:07,164 --> 00:28:09,457
This is the costume?

881
00:28:10,904 --> 00:28:13,304
(It's a shiny, feces-colored rag.)

882
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,604
This is for Groot?

883
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:15,903
(That rag will be Groot's body.)

884
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,661
It even covers my fingers.

885
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:21,114
We should put makeup on him before he puts that on.

886
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:24,614
I'm sorry, but could you please not whisper?

887
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,284
(He's become sensitive.)

888
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:28,598
Wear it.

889
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:29,724
Okay.

890
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:34,229
(How will he look with the costume on?)

891
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:35,653
Or we can do this.

892
00:28:35,654 --> 00:28:36,877
This is...

893
00:28:37,565 --> 00:28:39,524
- Oh, no. - There's no hole on the bottom.

894
00:28:39,525 --> 00:28:40,545
(Surprised)

895
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:41,693
There's no hole at the bottom.

896
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:43,351
(They refuse to look at him.)

897
00:28:43,634 --> 00:28:45,281
It's a bit tight.

898
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:47,957
I'm fine.

899
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,574
But it's really skintight.

900
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:53,807
I'm sorry. It's really tight.

901
00:28:54,214 --> 00:28:55,973
- What should I do? - Hurry and sit down.

902
00:28:55,974 --> 00:28:57,743
- It's skintight. - Hurry up and sit down.

903
00:28:57,744 --> 00:28:59,229
My feet are covered.

904
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:01,314
Hello.

905
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:02,830
(So Min, who'll be dressed as Yondu, arrives.)

906
00:29:03,384 --> 00:29:05,723
(This is what Yondu does, right?)

907
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:07,876
(Thinking he's a cool character, she enters cheerfully.)

908
00:29:08,394 --> 00:29:09,737
Hello.

909
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,723
Kwang Soo! Oh, no!

910
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:14,733
(Kwang Soo! Oh, no!)

911
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,064
- Welcome. - Hello.

912
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,433
- Hello. - He isn't Groot.

913
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:21,859
He's a trophy. Look at him.

914
00:29:22,134 --> 00:29:24,443
(His golden-brown costume...)

915
00:29:24,444 --> 00:29:26,344
(makes him look like a trophy.)

916
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:29,243
(It's a special trophy to celebrate their 9th anniversary.)

917
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:31,500
Hey, Yondu is cool.

918
00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:33,672
Wow, you're right.

919
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,584
(She'll be wearing a charismatic leather jacket.)

920
00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:37,645
- But... - Don't lie. You didn't even see it.

921
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:39,284
Don't lie. You didn't even see it.

922
00:29:39,285 --> 00:29:40,723
(I'm very sensitive right now.)

923
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:42,543
Don't be fake with your reactions.

924
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:45,723
- It's cool. - Yondu's costume is nice.

925
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:47,834
(So Min is content.)

926
00:29:47,835 --> 00:29:49,064
Is this mine?

927
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:52,235
(However, Yondu is known for his blue face.)

928
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:54,895
Kwang Soo, there's something odd.

929
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:57,969
There's silicone here.

930
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:01,643
There are a pair of scissors and tweezers.

931
00:30:01,644 --> 00:30:04,240
(It looks like an operating table.)

932
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:06,913
- Is this for my head? - Yes, to make it bald.

933
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,237
(Yes, to make it bald.)

934
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:11,402
What is this? Kwang Soo.

935
00:30:11,855 --> 00:30:13,124
This is my head.

936
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:14,653
(I think it's going to be bad for me.)

937
00:30:14,654 --> 00:30:16,764
I have feces on my face.

938
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,644
(It's already gone bad for me.)

939
00:30:19,595 --> 00:30:22,564
(Se Chan joins this chaos.)

940
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:26,403
(Laughing)

941
00:30:26,404 --> 00:30:29,004
(He bursts into laughter after seeing Kwang Soo's face.)

942
00:30:29,005 --> 00:30:30,604
- You look hilarious. - What are you doing?

943
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:32,393
- Why are you here already? - Se Chan.

944
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:34,597
Hi. Hi, So Min.

945
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,643
I saw you through the door gap,

946
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:39,109
- and you looked like a mess. - Doesn't he look like a trophy?

947
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:40,983
- Kwang Soo. - Hi, Ji Hyo.

948
00:30:40,984 --> 00:30:42,483
- So Min, hi. - Ji Hyo's here.

949
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,908
Look at Kwang Soo.

950
00:30:45,224 --> 00:30:47,881
Ji Hyo, start your makeup. Start right now.

951
00:30:48,355 --> 00:30:50,564
- Se Chan, it's bad for you too. - What?

952
00:30:50,565 --> 00:30:52,193
There's a lot of fur in there.

953
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:53,264
- Really? - Yes.

954
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:54,264
What's his name?

955
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:55,993
- What's his name? - Rocket?

956
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,733
- Rocket. - That's his name?

957
00:30:57,734 --> 00:30:58,775
Yes.

958
00:30:59,605 --> 00:31:00,947
(Staring)

959
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:03,074
Is this a real sword?

960
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,544
(Ji Hyo will transform into Gamora.)

961
00:31:04,545 --> 00:31:06,544
- Move aside. I have a sword. - Okay.

962
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:07,585
(Ji Hyo gets ready.)

963
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,844
(Jong Kook arrives.)

964
00:31:09,845 --> 00:31:10,913
Hello.

965
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:12,459
- Hello. - Hey.

966
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:15,600
Do you think I look like a raccoon?

967
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:17,824
(He looks like a delinquent.)

968
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:19,824
Jong Kook, look at this.

969
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:22,193
(I've seen this face before.)

970
00:31:22,194 --> 00:31:24,223
Do I seriously look like a raccoon?

971
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:25,524
Who are you?

972
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:26,693
(Se Chan has yet to put on the raccoon mask.)

973
00:31:26,694 --> 00:31:31,004
You remind me of "Journey to the West".

974
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,203
He's right.

975
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:35,004
(He just needs a crown to look like Sun Wukong.)

976
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:37,004
Hey, there's also Thor who has a good body.

977
00:31:37,005 --> 00:31:38,288
So why do I have to be Hulk?

978
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:40,844
You're right.

979
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,114
Why do I have to be Hulk?

980
00:31:42,115 --> 00:31:44,713
- They both have great physiques. - You're right.

981
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:47,183
Either Gamora or Hulk needs to come first.

982
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,814
- Go, Hulk. - Go first.

983
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:50,354
You'll take a while.

984
00:31:50,355 --> 00:31:52,274
I will? Don't I have a costume?

985
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,483
Maybe they'll do body painting.

986
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:55,273
I just need to paint my face, right?

987
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:57,163
You little...

988
00:31:57,164 --> 00:31:58,163
(I ought to hit you.)

989
00:31:58,164 --> 00:31:59,163
Hold on.

990
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,579
(Standing up)

991
00:32:00,595 --> 00:32:03,837
- Forget it. - Just wear these.

992
00:32:04,234 --> 00:32:05,264
Forget it.

993
00:32:05,265 --> 00:32:07,295
(He pulls his pants down.)

994
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:09,403
You can wear these.

995
00:32:09,404 --> 00:32:10,903
(Flustered)

996
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,004
You can wear them.

997
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:13,304
No, you should wear them.

998
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,213
- It's okay. - Put them back on.

999
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:17,204
I just wanted to help him.

1000
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,741
Does Yondu not have any ears?

1001
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,241
(She looks like a shuttlecock.)

1002
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,539
How detailed.

1003
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:28,907
He must not have any ears.

1004
00:32:29,424 --> 00:32:30,564
(What?)

1005
00:32:30,565 --> 00:32:32,594
Isn't that Noh Joo Hyun?

1006
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:33,794
(Let's see.)

1007
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:36,420
(She looks like Noh Joo Hyun.)

1008
00:32:37,305 --> 00:32:38,804
You know,

1009
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:40,574
Jong Kook is fit for Hulk,

1010
00:32:40,575 --> 00:32:42,903
I'm fit for Groot, and Se Chan is fit for Rocket.

1011
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,243
But why are you Yondu?

1012
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:47,173
(Why does he want to make you Yondu?)

1013
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:50,483
- We all look similar... - Right.

1014
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:52,383
- to characters. - I know what you mean.

1015
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:53,713
Because of that...

1016
00:32:53,714 --> 00:32:55,483
- Why are you Yondu? - I don't know.

1017
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:56,798
Why would Jae Seok say that?

1018
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,580
Jae Seok actually whispered in my ears yesterday,

1019
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:00,835
"You'll thank me."

1020
00:33:01,125 --> 00:33:02,669
"I'm making you a star."

1021
00:33:03,765 --> 00:33:05,006
So you're a star.

1022
00:33:05,994 --> 00:33:09,368
I think everyone didn't oppose to Jae Seok's decisions...

1023
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,963
because no one knew he'd win.

1024
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,349
- Right. - Right.

1025
00:33:12,734 --> 00:33:14,173
(He's surprised.)

1026
00:33:14,174 --> 00:33:15,245
Wait.

1027
00:33:15,734 --> 00:33:17,504
(Why are you making me wear that all of a sudden?)

1028
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:18,716
- Wait. - What is it?

1029
00:33:19,005 --> 00:33:20,143
What is that?

1030
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:21,689
It looks like a crown.

1031
00:33:21,744 --> 00:33:23,259
That doesn't even seem to belong to Groot.

1032
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:24,898
Wait. This looks like...

1033
00:33:25,085 --> 00:33:26,344
the decorations from sushi restaurants.

1034
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:29,385
(It looks like the decorations sushi restaurants give out.)

1035
00:33:30,214 --> 00:33:31,941
It looks better, though.

1036
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:34,711
- It's over. - It's over?

1037
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:37,644
Try to speak like Groot.

1038
00:33:38,525 --> 00:33:41,261
I mean, this is...

1039
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:42,864
Aren't you the sushi chef?

1040
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:45,733
(Are you the sushi chef?)

1041
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,996
(He looks like a tanned sushi chef.)

1042
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:50,226
"Welcome. Thank you for visiting".

1043
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:53,074
- He's the sushi chef. - It would be less embarrassing...

1044
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,893
if the other parts looked more like Groot.

1045
00:33:54,974 --> 00:33:56,473
(He looks at the mirror,)

1046
00:33:56,474 --> 00:33:58,883
(and feels more miserable.)

1047
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,754
Jong Kook.

1048
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:03,785
You're not Shrek, right? You're Hulk.

1049
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:05,423
I look like Shrek.

1050
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:07,010
(His face looks too green.)

1051
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:08,794
(Just be Shrek.)

1052
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,764
You'd never get in a car accident.

1053
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:13,521
(You'd never get in a car accident.)

1054
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:15,308
It's too...

1055
00:34:15,795 --> 00:34:17,178
He looks like Shrek.

1056
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,004
(The winner of Let's Make Merchandise Race has entered.)

1057
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:20,145
- Hi. - Hi.

1058
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:21,790
Kwang Soo.

1059
00:34:22,005 --> 00:34:24,570
Look at Se Chan.

1060
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:27,574
(He looks like the raccoon from the theme park.)

1061
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:29,060
My wig...

1062
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:31,243
makes me look like Jo Hye Ryun.

1063
00:34:31,244 --> 00:34:33,213
(His hair makes him look like Jo Hye Ryun.)

1064
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:34,396
Right.

1065
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:35,883
But you look better than the others.

1066
00:34:35,884 --> 00:34:36,953
I like the raccoon.

1067
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:38,642
So Min, do you know what you are?

1068
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:39,997
- Yes. - Good.

1069
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:42,712
I'll make you the star of the day.

1070
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:45,206
- Kwang Soo. - Yes?

1071
00:34:46,365 --> 00:34:47,404
Are you attaching it by yourself?

1072
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:48,545
It's just that...

1073
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,478
- she looked too busy. - Good.

1074
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:51,645
I was helping her.

1075
00:34:52,734 --> 00:34:55,733
These are my works of art, so please be careful.

1076
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:57,473
- We will. - All right?

1077
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:58,544
(Seok Jin enters and he'll be Gung Ye.)

1078
00:34:58,545 --> 00:34:59,643
What?

1079
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:01,174
Here comes Gung Ye.

1080
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,185
Gung Ye is here.

1081
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,183
- Hello. - Hello.

1082
00:35:04,184 --> 00:35:05,295
(Laughing)

1083
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:06,456
Seok Jin.

1084
00:35:06,614 --> 00:35:07,613
He's laughing.

1085
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,100
- Seok Jin is enjoying it. - Hi.

1086
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,524
Goodness.

1087
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,272
So Min's head is so pretty.

1088
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:14,453
Don't lie to her. The back of her head is so flat.

1089
00:35:14,454 --> 00:35:16,553
(He's insulting her with facts.)

1090
00:35:16,554 --> 00:35:18,040
(It's flat.)

1091
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:20,313
Why did you make me Gung Ye?

1092
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,785
The other members are all heroes.

1093
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:26,467
Gung Ye could read minds. He's the father of heroes.

1094
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:28,996
This is ridiculous.

1095
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:31,104
Is Ant-Man coming late,

1096
00:35:31,105 --> 00:35:32,255
or we just can't see him?

1097
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,126
Is he wearing his costume in here?

1098
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:37,162
Watch your feet, everyone.

1099
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:40,413
(Here comes Ant-Man.)

1100
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,854
- There he is. - There's Ant-Man.

1101
00:35:41,855 --> 00:35:43,330
- Hello. - Ant-Man.

1102
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:44,984
- Why are you late? - Hello.

1103
00:35:44,985 --> 00:35:46,268
I just got the call.

1104
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:49,524
- You're wearing cute today. - It's pretty.

1105
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:51,393
You wear so well usually,

1106
00:35:51,394 --> 00:35:52,981
why do you wear like that on camera?

1107
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:54,294
(I get that a lot.)

1108
00:35:54,295 --> 00:35:55,477
I get that a lot.

1109
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:57,151
- Why do you wear like that? - What are you?

1110
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:58,617
I'm a raccoon.

1111
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:00,589
How is that a raccoon? You look like a bum.

1112
00:36:02,835 --> 00:36:04,490
Or a beggar who sings on the street.

1113
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:07,743
Kwang Soo.

1114
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:08,973
(He's still working on his crown.)

1115
00:36:08,974 --> 00:36:10,013
He's Groot.

1116
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:12,384
- Are you a long poop? - Did you say "poop"?

1117
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:14,214
(He's shocked by his looks.)

1118
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:15,295
Did you say "poop"?

1119
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:17,067
Did you say "poop"?

1120
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:19,254
- I'm a chocolate pie. - You're a chocolate pie?

1121
00:36:19,255 --> 00:36:21,820
I'll make you a star, Kwang Soo.

1122
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:23,945
- You should thank him. - You should thank me.

1123
00:36:25,025 --> 00:36:26,124
(Here's another one who will become a star.)

1124
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,145
I look so unfamiliar.

1125
00:36:27,664 --> 00:36:28,763
(You are a star, right?)

1126
00:36:28,764 --> 00:36:29,946
It's too unfamiliar.

1127
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,680
(Tapping)

1128
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:35,573
(Ant-Man with the suit enters.)

1129
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:36,686
(Awing)

1130
00:36:37,204 --> 00:36:38,487
What are you awing for?

1131
00:36:39,644 --> 00:36:41,190
- You look good. - Really?

1132
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,613
Really.

1133
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,283
- It's so cool with the suit. - Yes.

1134
00:36:44,284 --> 00:36:45,457
Even your body looks better.

1135
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,426
He's got six-pack abs.

1136
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:48,654
No, they're eight-pack abs.

1137
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,214
(He now has six-pack abs thanks to his role.)

1138
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:54,154
(Meanwhile...)

1139
00:36:54,155 --> 00:36:55,323
What am I wearing?

1140
00:36:55,324 --> 00:36:57,323
(What am I wearing?)

1141
00:36:57,324 --> 00:36:58,638
He said, "What am I wearing?"

1142
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,711
He said, "What am I wearing?"

1143
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,113
I look like the mascot for a sushi restaurant event.

1144
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,383
You still have to come to my house today...

1145
00:37:06,264 --> 00:37:07,587
- What? - with Se Chan.

1146
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,585
For the performance for your son?

1147
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:11,794
I made a reservation at a family restaurant.

1148
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:13,860
Isn't that place filled with people?

1149
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,930
Let's go somewhere less crowded.

1150
00:37:16,244 --> 00:37:17,628
There will be too many people.

1151
00:37:17,684 --> 00:37:18,814
Why are we going there?

1152
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:22,086
My son's best friend, Eun Je, it's his birthday.

1153
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:24,305
You should go to more events while you're at it.

1154
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:25,384
You're coming too.

1155
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:28,093
(You're coming to the birthday party too.)

1156
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:29,393
(I'm coming too?)

1157
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,794
But kids don't like Gung Ye.

1158
00:37:31,795 --> 00:37:32,924
- They do. - They do.

1159
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:34,393
Kids don't like Gung Ye.

1160
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:35,879
They like what you guys are.

1161
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,893
- Ji Hyo looks awesome. - Let me take a look.

1162
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,634
She actually looks like one.

1163
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:42,104
(She looks like the real one.)

1164
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:43,720
She looks too much alike, it's almost scary.

1165
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,097
- I'm getting chills. - It's interesting.

1166
00:37:46,105 --> 00:37:47,774
I do look alike.

1167
00:37:47,775 --> 00:37:50,274
- You do. - It's your face.

1168
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,314
(Next to Ji Hyo's high-quality makeup is...)

1169
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:54,384
(Look at that.)

1170
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:55,496
Hey, Yondu.

1171
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:57,605
(What?)

1172
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,509
(Did you call my name?)

1173
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:04,363
(You can do anything but smile.)

1174
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,941
(Please don't look at us.)

1175
00:38:06,894 --> 00:38:09,157
(She's disappointed.)

1176
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:11,203
(Excuse me.)

1177
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:14,164
- You have to put on the mustache. - What?

1178
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,224
- What? - There's a mustache?

1179
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:17,843
Is there a mustache?

1180
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:20,613
(Because Yondu is the blue guy with a lot of mustaches.)

1181
00:38:20,614 --> 00:38:23,342
(The Yondu make up is looking better as it goes on.)

1182
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,667
- Is she getting the horn too? - Yes.

1183
00:38:27,114 --> 00:38:28,266
- Really? - I'll show you.

1184
00:38:28,985 --> 00:38:30,053
What is that?

1185
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:31,154
(He's taking out something.)

1186
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,145
(It's a fluorescent pink horn.)

1187
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:35,806
Wait.

1188
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:38,450
(The blue face and mustache are finished with a pink horn.)

1189
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:39,863
Look.

1190
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:41,208
I was wondering what that was.

1191
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:42,763
I didn't know what it was.

1192
00:38:42,764 --> 00:38:44,263
- Sit down. - I'm going home!

1193
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:45,433
No, don't.

1194
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:47,473
- This is the last one. - This is the last one.

1195
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:49,929
- You're almost done. - I want to go home.

1196
00:38:49,974 --> 00:38:51,793
- Please. - I thought this was...

1197
00:38:52,275 --> 00:38:54,444
a sponge for washing dishes.

1198
00:38:54,445 --> 00:38:56,738
- Then he put it on her head. - Then he...

1199
00:38:57,014 --> 00:38:58,227
placed it on her head.

1200
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,783
(It's very tough...)

1201
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:02,384
(to become a star.)

1202
00:39:02,385 --> 00:39:03,970
I want to go home right now.

1203
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,654
Look at this.

1204
00:39:05,655 --> 00:39:06,836
(I approve of that she's a real star.)

1205
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,723
- Stop teasing her. - I mean...

1206
00:39:09,724 --> 00:39:11,340
The fish roe soup guy wants us to stop.

1207
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,525
(Laughing)

1208
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:18,184
What is that laughing sound?

1209
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:19,477
Is that coming from the fish roe?

1210
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,952
Hey, green onion.

1211
00:39:23,304 --> 00:39:25,931
- Get away from me, green onion. - Did you call me a green onion?

1212
00:39:26,945 --> 00:39:28,056
I'm done.

1213
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:32,169
(The makeup of her life is finished.)

1214
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:34,425
Can I get a picture?

1215
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:38,453
I'm just a raccoon passing by.

1216
00:39:38,454 --> 00:39:39,869
Can I get a picture with you?

1217
00:39:40,054 --> 00:39:41,206
I'm just a raccoon passing by.

1218
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,816
So Min, stand in the middle.

1219
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:45,138
Let's take a picture with the wood.

1220
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,275
I'm just Gung Ye passing by.

1221
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:50,363
(What will their makeups look like in the end?)

1222
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:51,834
All heroes, come here.

1223
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:52,874
(It's time to take the pictures for the T-shirt.)

1224
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,116
Everyone.

1225
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:58,004
Jae Seok is trying to look cool. He likes his costume.

1226
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,104
This costume...

1227
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,498
is a lot better with the pin on the back.

1228
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:02,874
- It makes you look better. - But on the back...

1229
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,444
- It's a mess. - It makes you look better.

1230
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:05,696
Right.

1231
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:08,179
- Come here, heroes. - Yes, I'm ready.

1232
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:10,613
Our stylists...

1233
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:12,877
have perfectly...

1234
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:15,045
Ji Hyo looks like the actual character.

1235
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:17,007
- Look at Ji Hyo. - She's like the actress.

1236
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:18,736
Hey, Ant-Man.

1237
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,137
Come here.

1238
00:40:20,324 --> 00:40:22,516
Why am I Gung Ye?

1239
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:25,630
- You guys are all the avengers. - Come here, Avengers.

1240
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,895
Come here, Avengers.

1241
00:40:27,905 --> 00:40:30,174
- Let's gather here. - We're Guardians of the Galaxy.

1242
00:40:30,175 --> 00:40:31,703
You're Guardians of the Galaxy.

1243
00:40:31,704 --> 00:40:33,544
Gung Ye can find another set.

1244
00:40:33,545 --> 00:40:35,594
(Gung Ye can find another set.)

1245
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:37,714
- You should be at the Folk Village. - Go to another set.

1246
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:39,563
- Go to the Folk Village. - Why am I the only one?

1247
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:41,673
Why am I wearing this alone?

1248
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:44,854
You guys are all the avengers and I'm Gung Ye.

1249
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:46,254
Mr. Fish-roe-soup, this isn't your set.

1250
00:40:46,255 --> 00:40:47,924
Stop calling me fish roe soup. I'm Gung Ye.

1251
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:48,953
(You have insulted Gung Ye.)

1252
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:50,593
Right. He's Gung Ye.

1253
00:40:50,594 --> 00:40:51,776
I have to check...

1254
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,259
the costumes starting with Groot.

1255
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:55,850
Why is Groot so...

1256
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,052
- Is that the vine? - Yes.

1257
00:40:58,434 --> 00:40:59,834
- It's the vine. - It's the vine?

1258
00:40:59,835 --> 00:41:01,604
Okay. Wait.

1259
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:03,826
(And he moves on to Yondu.)

1260
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,504
- I... - She's perfect.

1261
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:07,060
(It's Captain Yumerica's masterpiece.)

1262
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,426
She's Yondu.

1263
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:09,585
- It's awesome. - Sorry.

1264
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:11,630
(He's satisfied.)

1265
00:41:12,385 --> 00:41:14,814
- That's a sponge on her head. - She looks like a chicken.

1266
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:16,774
- No, she's not. - I think...

1267
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:19,323
she could be cast as Yondu's daughter in Hollywood.

1268
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:20,598
- Seriously. - Seriously.

1269
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:22,654
I mean...

1270
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:24,564
(Do you want to get pierced with my arrow?)

1271
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,545
- I mean... - You should work at my restaurant.

1272
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:29,089
(The owner is scouting her.)

1273
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:30,780
I'll put the meat on her head instead of the headpiece.

1274
00:41:31,704 --> 00:41:32,933
(She was cast at the barbecue place before Hollywood.)

1275
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:35,404
Stay put, Ant-Man.

1276
00:41:35,405 --> 00:41:38,044
- Stay put, you have nothing. - Stay put.

1277
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:39,621
He'll be photoshopped smaller in the photo, right?

1278
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:40,774
He actually...

1279
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:42,143
didn't need to put on the suit.

1280
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,690
But thank you for your dedication.

1281
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:45,513
(Sighing)

1282
00:41:45,514 --> 00:41:46,884
Ant-Man will...

1283
00:41:46,885 --> 00:41:48,905
- almost look like a dot. - He should.

1284
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:50,823
So the fans can find you...

1285
00:41:50,824 --> 00:41:52,453
with a magnifying glass.

1286
00:41:52,454 --> 00:41:53,723
There's fun in that.

1287
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:55,393
- With a magnifying glass. - Right.

1288
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:57,294
- It'll be quite fun. - I like it.

1289
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,363
That's why you're being a dot.

1290
00:41:58,364 --> 00:42:01,121
I've been complimenting the staff.

1291
00:42:01,195 --> 00:42:02,834
Gamora looks so real.

1292
00:42:02,835 --> 00:42:04,006
She looks exactly like her.

1293
00:42:04,094 --> 00:42:05,134
- Right. - Right.

1294
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:07,134
I think you'll be in the news.

1295
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:08,933
- I was so surprised. - Her face is so similar.

1296
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:12,004
In "Guardians of the Galaxy", Gamora is actually...

1297
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:13,444
- She's considered beautiful. - Yes.

1298
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:14,573
You're perfect.

1299
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,874
- You... - I'm the daughter of Thanos.

1300
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,484
You two should thank me.

1301
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:18,858
(You two should thank me.)

1302
00:42:19,514 --> 00:42:22,084
(Did we hear him right? We should thank him?)

1303
00:42:22,085 --> 00:42:24,683
- Are you sure? - We're all related to our roles,

1304
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:25,867
but why is So Min Yondu?

1305
00:42:25,954 --> 00:42:29,154
Right, why did you make me Yondu?

1306
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:30,811
She and Yondu have nothing in common.

1307
00:42:30,894 --> 00:42:32,823
- She even has a mustache. - Why?

1308
00:42:32,824 --> 00:42:34,533
- You're... - I love my character.

1309
00:42:34,534 --> 00:42:36,313
- Rocket looks very good. - It's perfect.

1310
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:37,604
- You look like a raccoon. - Yes.

1311
00:42:37,605 --> 00:42:38,947
Jong Kook is also perfect.

1312
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:40,703
I have nothing more to say about him.

1313
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,755
- That's not even padded. - That's not even padded.

1314
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,004
- Right. - It's his actual muscles.

1315
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,143
I thought it was stuffed with cotton, but it's just a tight shirt.

1316
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:47,743
- I love Jong Kook's costume. - Yes.

1317
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:50,214
And for you, Gung Ye...

1318
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:51,413
- has a mind-reading ability. - That's right.

1319
00:42:51,414 --> 00:42:52,984
- He can read other people's minds. - Yes.

1320
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:55,479
- Who dares to sneeze? - It was a cough.

1321
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:56,814
It was a cough.

1322
00:42:56,815 --> 00:42:58,953
Who dares to make coughing noises?

1323
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:00,701
Who dares to make coughing noises?

1324
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,893
Who dares to make coughing noises?

1325
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,464
That's not how you do it.

1326
00:43:04,465 --> 00:43:06,024
Actually, when Seok Jin was using the toilet...

1327
00:43:06,025 --> 00:43:08,156
This is a true story. It really happened.

1328
00:43:08,164 --> 00:43:09,751
When Seok Jin was using the toilet,

1329
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,148
he farted.

1330
00:43:12,235 --> 00:43:14,356
And then he said, "Who dares to make coughing noises?"

1331
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,374
(He pretended that he didn't fart.)

1332
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,021
It's true! Isn't it, Seok Jin?

1333
00:43:18,644 --> 00:43:19,944
- Yes, it is. - Anyway,

1334
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:22,544
since this is going to be printed on the shirts,

1335
00:43:22,545 --> 00:43:24,384
please do your best to stay in character.

1336
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:26,214
- All right. - Could you give us our positions?

1337
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:28,810
- Sure. I'll be in the center. - Okay.

1338
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:31,754
We're going to take several shots and choose the best one.

1339
00:43:31,755 --> 00:43:33,424
When you take the group picture,

1340
00:43:33,425 --> 00:43:35,294
could you make sure Haha doesn't get overlapped with the others?

1341
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,924
You need to be isolated.

1342
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:38,124
(I can't be overlapped since I'm Ant-man.)

1343
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,163
How sad.

1344
00:43:39,164 --> 00:43:40,564
Can't you just take his picture separately?

1345
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:42,393
- It won't matter. - He can take it on his own.

1346
00:43:42,394 --> 00:43:43,694
Don't be sullen.

1347
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:45,734
- He can just be photoshopped in. - Since you're Ant-Man.

1348
00:43:45,735 --> 00:43:48,229
It'll be fun to zoom in the picture to see me.

1349
00:43:48,875 --> 00:43:50,774
(The 7 members stand by the middle...)

1350
00:43:50,775 --> 00:43:53,329
(and 1 member stays in the corner.)

1351
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:55,288
Do I put my mask on or not?

1352
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,374
You can take it on and off.

1353
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,444
(Will my face show if I do this?)

1354
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:00,113
Whether your face shows or not isn't important.

1355
00:44:00,114 --> 00:44:01,314
Your face won't even show.

1356
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:03,911
(Whether your face shows or not isn't important.)

1357
00:44:06,284 --> 00:44:07,334
How sad.

1358
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:08,870
Let's begin.

1359
00:44:09,755 --> 00:44:13,263
Act like you're actually saving the world.

1360
00:44:13,264 --> 00:44:14,933
(Acting like they're actually saving the world,)

1361
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:16,093
We will begin the shoot.

1362
00:44:16,094 --> 00:44:18,225
(they begin the shoot with a serious and cool face.)

1363
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:21,493
(I am saving the world.)

1364
00:44:22,635 --> 00:44:24,073
(Click click)

1365
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:25,143
Great.

1366
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:26,303
Come over here, Haha.

1367
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:27,830
We'll play with you. Come here.

1368
00:44:28,114 --> 00:44:29,814
- How cute. - I can pretend that I'm normal now.

1369
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:31,113
- Come over here. - We'll play with you.

1370
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:34,683
(They take the second group picture with Ant-Man.)

1371
00:44:34,684 --> 00:44:36,953
(So full of confidence)

1372
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:38,854
Don't act so cool!

1373
00:44:38,855 --> 00:44:42,086
(Gosh, don't act so cool!)

1374
00:44:42,224 --> 00:44:44,624
How dare you do this?

1375
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,064
(How dare you act so cool?)

1376
00:44:46,065 --> 00:44:47,540
You're holding a fake shield, too!

1377
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:49,263
(Hey, I'm Captain!)

1378
00:44:49,264 --> 00:44:50,694
I almost thought you were actually saving the world.

1379
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:53,159
- How about you? - I should have won.

1380
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:54,985
For the next pose,

1381
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:58,073
how about if we pretend that the enemies are in front of us,

1382
00:44:58,074 --> 00:44:59,504
- so we're surprised? - Acting surprised?

1383
00:44:59,505 --> 00:45:01,143
- Don't join us, Seok Jin. - Why not?

1384
00:45:01,144 --> 00:45:02,174
Why can't I be surprised?

1385
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:04,912
Gung Ye doesn't have to change positions so often.

1386
00:45:05,184 --> 00:45:08,013
- Can the rest of the heroes do it? - Okay.

1387
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:10,984
(Posing)

1388
00:45:10,985 --> 00:45:12,384
I told you not to do it.

1389
00:45:12,385 --> 00:45:14,354
(Get lost, enemies!)

1390
00:45:14,355 --> 00:45:16,993
- He's at it again! - Don't do that.

1391
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:18,794
- Why does he keep doing that? - Excuse me,

1392
00:45:18,795 --> 00:45:21,464
- this isn't "Shaolin Temple". - It's no fun if I stay put.

1393
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,393
And why do you keep moving forward?

1394
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:25,050
- I'm the only Asian character. - Wait a minute.

1395
00:45:25,204 --> 00:45:26,234
Why?

1396
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:27,504
Stay over here on this side.

1397
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:29,803
I won't be able to read minds here.

1398
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:31,996
- Just stay there. - You can't be in front of Ant-Man.

1399
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:33,818
Oh my gosh.

1400
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:35,691
(You're the best, Captain Yumerica.)

1401
00:45:35,974 --> 00:45:38,143
- Let's huddle a bit. - Okay.

1402
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:39,384
(They continue on after Captain Yumerica fixes the positions.)

1403
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:41,654
- Get closer. - Just stand there...

1404
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,513
- and stare out into the distance. - Exactly.

1405
00:45:43,514 --> 00:45:46,124
- That's it. How cool is that? - Like you're protecting the Earth.

1406
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,851
Who dares to see my mind-reading?

1407
00:45:52,695 --> 00:45:54,634
- Now, for the individual shots. - Let's take the individual shots.

1408
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,564
Please move over for the individual shots.

1409
00:45:56,565 --> 00:45:57,904
We will shoot three different poses.

1410
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,379
Look at that confident face.

1411
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,573
He thinks he's really Captain.

1412
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,423
Stop acting so cool.

1413
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:05,703
You seem so unfamiliar without your glasses.

1414
00:46:05,704 --> 00:46:06,855
He's wearing a fake costume, too.

1415
00:46:07,744 --> 00:46:09,143
(He's acting so cool when he's wearing a fake costume.)

1416
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:11,444
- Gosh... - He's wearing a 30-dollar costume.

1417
00:46:11,445 --> 00:46:12,556
(That tiny ant...)

1418
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:14,228
He's wearing a 30-dollar costume.

1419
00:46:15,215 --> 00:46:16,971
(You're not cool at all.)

1420
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:19,584
(Gung Ye gets in next to take the individual photos.)

1421
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:22,093
- Let's go with Hulk, next. - Great.

1422
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:24,464
- Let's go with Hulk, next. - Great.

1423
00:46:24,465 --> 00:46:25,723
- Excuse us. - Come on!

1424
00:46:25,724 --> 00:46:27,863
- The avengers need to go first. - We should go first.

1425
00:46:27,864 --> 00:46:28,993
The avengers will go first.

1426
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,033
(Hulk starts to pose...)

1427
00:46:30,034 --> 00:46:31,564
- He looks genuine. - Great.

1428
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:33,423
You look like the real Hulk.

1429
00:46:33,565 --> 00:46:34,803
Amazing.

1430
00:46:34,804 --> 00:46:36,623
- That's it. - Could you do this...

1431
00:46:36,735 --> 00:46:38,404
just in case?

1432
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:39,604
- What? - Oh, this.

1433
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:40,674
(Are you going to put Ant-Man in my hand?)

1434
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:41,685
- That's it. - Ant-Man.

1435
00:46:42,014 --> 00:46:43,944
We're going to put the meat on your hand.

1436
00:46:43,945 --> 00:46:46,339
(We're going to put the meat in your hand.)

1437
00:46:47,784 --> 00:46:48,783
Hey!

1438
00:46:48,784 --> 00:46:49,854
(Even his business partner is embarrassed.)

1439
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:52,424
- Don't you dare use it for that. - Come on, let's share.

1440
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:54,593
This isn't for caldron lid meat, you know!

1441
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:56,124
(What a good idea!)

1442
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:58,024
This isn't for caldron lid meat.

1443
00:46:58,025 --> 00:47:00,387
- Can you pose for that? - Don't you dare use my shield.

1444
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:03,656
Let's go with Guardians of the Galaxy next.

1445
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:06,703
(Gung Ye comes to the center while they are busy with the meat.)

1446
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:08,033
(He gets pushed aside again for Guardians of the Galaxy.)

1447
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,134
It is Guardians of the Galaxy's turn.

1448
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:10,703
- This is driving me crazy. - Guardians of the Galaxy.

1449
00:47:10,704 --> 00:47:12,422
- Hey! - They need to shoot.

1450
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:13,544
(Next is Rocket of the Guardians of the Galaxy.)

1451
00:47:13,545 --> 00:47:15,513
- He looks just like him. - He's identical.

1452
00:47:15,514 --> 00:47:17,274
Hey, you look better this way.

1453
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:18,743
Next is Gamora.

1454
00:47:18,744 --> 00:47:20,683
- She looks exactly like her. - Gamora looks great.

1455
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,013
- You're all perfect! - She looks exactly like her.

1456
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:23,984
She looks exactly like her. Ji Hyo, can you do this, too?

1457
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:25,183
This pose. A knife...

1458
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:26,624
I told you not to do that!

1459
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,170
Why would the Hulk and Ant-man be doing that pose?

1460
00:47:28,454 --> 00:47:29,624
- Come on, try it. - Hey!

1461
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,993
- Try using a knife. - Come over here.

1462
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:32,194
Cut the meat with a knife.

1463
00:47:32,195 --> 00:47:33,579
Could you take that for me?

1464
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:35,134
What's wrong with him?

1465
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:36,493
- Yondu, next. - Yondu.

1466
00:47:36,494 --> 00:47:37,493
The chicken.

1467
00:47:37,494 --> 00:47:39,263
- "Chicken? - You're a chicken.

1468
00:47:39,264 --> 00:47:40,819
(Cute)

1469
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,659
(Cutie Yondu is here!)

1470
00:47:44,434 --> 00:47:47,171
- What kind of Yondu are you? - Don't act out of character!

1471
00:47:47,844 --> 00:47:49,174
You're Yondu!

1472
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:51,814
- That's so terrifying. - What are you doing?

1473
00:47:51,815 --> 00:47:53,143
- You look so scary! - What is she doing?

1474
00:47:53,144 --> 00:47:54,513
Don't do that!

1475
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:56,254
- Don't do that! - What is she doing, that Yondu!

1476
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:57,823
- You have a beard? - What kind of Yondu are you?

1477
00:47:57,824 --> 00:47:58,965
She has a beard.

1478
00:47:59,684 --> 00:48:00,998
Next is...

1479
00:48:01,355 --> 00:48:03,173
- Groot. - Groot.

1480
00:48:05,565 --> 00:48:06,636
Okay, you're done. Get out.

1481
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:08,433
- Already? - Move over.

1482
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:10,064
Hey, could you point to your head...

1483
00:48:10,065 --> 00:48:11,464
and make a three?

1484
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:13,464
(Could you point to your head and make a 3?)

1485
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:14,788
- Don't do it. - What's that?

1486
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,551
- Bamboo meat. - No, don't do it.

1487
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:17,703
Bamboo meat?

1488
00:48:17,704 --> 00:48:19,404
- Come on, do it. - Don't.

1489
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:20,743
Come on!

1490
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:22,444
You can go next, Seok Jin.

1491
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:23,585
- Help me. - You can do the mind-reading.

1492
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:27,084
Who dares to make coughing noises?

1493
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:28,296
He's so bad at it.

1494
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,128
He's so bad at acting.

1495
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:32,254
- This isn't the "Shaolin Temple"! - Seok Jin...

1496
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,294
Seok Jin!

1497
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:35,366
(Isn't this right?)

1498
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:37,254
Let's go with Haha next. Ant-Man.

1499
00:48:37,255 --> 00:48:38,624
Ant-Man.

1500
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,544
- He's putting on his mask. - Come on.

1501
00:48:40,565 --> 00:48:43,119
- Okay, great. - We didn't even need him to come.

1502
00:48:43,164 --> 00:48:44,734
- Someone else could have done it. - No one will know it's him.

1503
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,263
How can you tell in the picture?

1504
00:48:46,264 --> 00:48:47,678
- That's enough. - Show your face, Haha.

1505
00:48:48,505 --> 00:48:50,134
That's enough. Move over.

1506
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,604
Come over here, Jong Kook. Hurry.

1507
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:52,874
- What are they doing? - What are you doing?

1508
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:55,067
Is it for the restaurant?

1509
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,743
- Stop that! - What are you doing?

1510
00:48:56,744 --> 00:48:57,984
- What are you doing? - Don't take the pictures...

1511
00:48:57,985 --> 00:48:59,544
- for personal use! - Don't take them!

1512
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:01,513
- Come over here. - What are you doing?

1513
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:03,214
Can you hold this up for a minute?

1514
00:49:03,215 --> 00:49:05,854
Don't you dare photoshop the meat on this.

1515
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,138
Could you put your head on this?

1516
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:09,654
- Put your head on it to grill. - I'll cut it up.

1517
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:10,654
Okay, cut it.

1518
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:12,140
Let's take it.

1519
00:49:12,425 --> 00:49:14,657
- What's this? - I'll start the fire, then.

1520
00:49:15,065 --> 00:49:17,054
(The poster for the restaurant is completed!)

1521
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:18,663
(Korean Barbeque House, Captain's Caldron Lid Meat)

1522
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,563
(Come to Haha and Jong Kook's Avengers Barbecue House.)

1523
00:49:21,574 --> 00:49:22,888
It's a barbecue place.

1524
00:49:23,235 --> 00:49:24,922
- Hey, wait. - That's enough.

1525
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:26,944
- Thank you. - Good job.

1526
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:28,843
- Good job, everyone. - Good job.

1527
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:30,057
Good job.

1528
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:34,953
(The final picture will be revealed on the day of the fan-meet.)

1529
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,714
How are we supposed to do this?

1530
00:49:37,715 --> 00:49:40,584
Since Lia dances well,

1531
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:44,154
she makes even the simplest moves look so cool,

1532
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,821
- but we won't be able to do that. - No.

1533
00:49:47,164 --> 00:49:49,589
Why are you already sitting down and talking?

1534
00:49:50,534 --> 00:49:52,104
(Serious)

1535
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:54,303
We were talking about how hard it will be for us.

1536
00:49:54,304 --> 00:49:56,374
- Since you guys are full of power. - It may be hard for the ladies.

1537
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,122
- But we aren't. - You can do it.

1538
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:00,203
(As soon as they saw the video,)

1539
00:50:00,204 --> 00:50:01,690
(she looked grim.)

1540
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:05,745
(They all dance in unity to the beat.)

1541
00:50:06,614 --> 00:50:09,484
(It is a powerful dance where you can feel the dancers' strength.)

1542
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:10,913
No way, we can't be doing that.

1543
00:50:10,914 --> 00:50:15,540
(Will they be able to do it in time?)

1544
00:50:16,155 --> 00:50:18,517
So Min is already...

1545
00:50:18,525 --> 00:50:20,694
a good dancer.

1546
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:23,926
I only know how to dance at the nightclub.

1547
00:50:24,264 --> 00:50:27,263
(I am good at nightclub dancing.)

1548
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:28,504
I don't know how to dance like that.

1549
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:30,626
Show us, then. Show us that move.

1550
00:50:30,835 --> 00:50:32,763
- This one! - Yes, that's the one.

1551
00:50:33,275 --> 00:50:35,444
(I was a clubber back in the days!)

1552
00:50:35,445 --> 00:50:37,061
This is how we dance.

1553
00:50:38,045 --> 00:50:39,944
(She's good.)

1554
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,953
Why don't you show her, Se Chan?

1555
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,053
Like this.

1556
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:44,398
(I can dance, too.)

1557
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:46,524
(Pointing here and there)

1558
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:48,110
Oh, you're good.

1559
00:50:48,195 --> 00:50:49,393
Can't we just do this?

1560
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:51,154
She's laughing so hard.

1561
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:52,863
I don't think she's ever laughed because of a dance.

1562
00:50:52,864 --> 00:50:54,294
- Hey... - Like this.

1563
00:50:54,295 --> 00:50:55,334
- How about this? - How about that?

1564
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,415
- If it's anything like this, - How does that look?

1565
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:59,234
- we can do it. - We can manage that.

1566
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:01,504
I just had a vision...

1567
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:03,424
of us dancing on stage.

1568
00:51:04,434 --> 00:51:06,504
(He saw what they would look like on stage.)

1569
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:07,655
- Are you a superhero? - I mean...

1570
00:51:07,775 --> 00:51:09,113
we will be doing it,

1571
00:51:09,114 --> 00:51:11,743
but we won't look anything like them.

1572
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:13,343
- You saw our future? - Yes.

1573
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:14,384
Just for a minute

1574
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:16,754
We'll have a perfect ending, though.

1575
00:51:16,755 --> 00:51:18,183
(They're going to make the ending right.)

1576
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:20,924
But it might just be the case...

1577
00:51:20,925 --> 00:51:22,794
where you didn't know that you could dance...

1578
00:51:22,795 --> 00:51:24,674
until now.

1579
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:25,834
- No way. - I mean...

1580
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:27,863
(He's suddenly dropping his manners.)

1581
00:51:27,864 --> 00:51:29,163
since you've never tried.

1582
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:31,064
- Why are you being rude to her? - Since you've never tried.

1583
00:51:31,065 --> 00:51:33,033
How could you talk to our teacher like that?

1584
00:51:33,034 --> 00:51:35,203
- I didn't mean to say that. - How could you say that?

1585
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:37,504
- I was only... - How could you say that?

1586
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:38,643
I was only...

1587
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:40,073
You even told us to speak impolitely.

1588
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:41,243
What do you think you're doing?

1589
00:51:41,244 --> 00:51:44,314
I'm sorry, I was only trying to say that it's impossible for us.

1590
00:51:44,315 --> 00:51:45,513
Oh, is that so?

1591
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:47,969
Seok Jin, why don't you show us your "Fire" dance?

1592
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:49,513
Look at him.

1593
00:51:49,514 --> 00:51:50,884
(He is showing her his best moves.)

1594
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:51,935
(Swinging around)

1595
00:51:52,585 --> 00:51:54,553
(He washes his face...)

1596
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:57,553
(and dries off.)

1597
00:51:57,554 --> 00:51:59,194
2, 5, shoot! Shoot, shoot.

1598
00:51:59,195 --> 00:52:01,294
I'm actually not that worried anymore,

1599
00:52:01,295 --> 00:52:02,694
- after seeing his moves. - Really?

1600
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:04,593
- My speed is... - He's quite swift.

1601
00:52:04,594 --> 00:52:06,382
I keep hearing his bones crack, though.

1602
00:52:06,905 --> 00:52:08,734
(Cracking)

1603
00:52:08,735 --> 00:52:10,422
(His body cannot support his passion.)

1604
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:11,743
(Are you okay?)

1605
00:52:11,744 --> 00:52:13,703
- I kept hearing it. - That's enough, Seok Jin.

1606
00:52:13,704 --> 00:52:15,243
- It's all right. - You don't have to do that.

1607
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:17,044
I think you pulled a muscle.

1608
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:18,814
He needs to act fine if he wants her to teach him.

1609
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,642
He's fine. They're not important bones, anyway.

1610
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,254
It's nothing serious.

1611
00:52:23,255 --> 00:52:24,884
You can manage us, right?

1612
00:52:24,885 --> 00:52:26,154
- Sure. - We're good enough.

1613
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:27,783
Yes, I think you'll do well.

1614
00:52:27,784 --> 00:52:29,953
There are a lot of students...

1615
00:52:29,954 --> 00:52:31,794
who came as terrible dancers,

1616
00:52:31,795 --> 00:52:33,924
but turned into great dancers after your classes, right?

1617
00:52:33,925 --> 00:52:35,393
Yes, of course.

1618
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:37,533
Son Dam Bi was a terrible dancer.

1619
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,004
- No way! - Dam Bi?

1620
00:52:39,005 --> 00:52:40,985
- She mentioned that before. - Yes.

1621
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:42,573
It took Dam Bi...

1622
00:52:42,574 --> 00:52:46,004
a long time to learn how to dance. She struggled a lot.

1623
00:52:46,005 --> 00:52:48,643
She overcame with her effort.

1624
00:52:48,644 --> 00:52:50,413
She could be a scary teacher.

1625
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:52,013
We are worried that you would be different...

1626
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:53,714
- when you begin to teach us. - It's entirely possible.

1627
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:56,584
- Do you get angry at your students? - I am incredibly sensitive.

1628
00:52:56,585 --> 00:52:57,913
- I am a perfectionist. - Really?

1629
00:52:57,914 --> 00:52:59,654
- This is a disaster. - So I might...

1630
00:52:59,655 --> 00:53:01,223
Do many students cry?

1631
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:02,538
- What? - Do many students cry?

1632
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:05,024
When they cry, I ignore them.

1633
00:53:05,025 --> 00:53:06,035
(When they cry, I ignore them.)

1634
00:53:06,364 --> 00:53:07,924
(The cruel world of dance)

1635
00:53:07,925 --> 00:53:09,176
She is cold-hearted.

1636
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,050
- That's cold. - She is cold-hearted.

1637
00:53:11,635 --> 00:53:13,663
Otherwise, I tell them to go outside.

1638
00:53:13,664 --> 00:53:16,504
- "Would you go outside and cry?" - "You can go to the restroom."

1639
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:18,565
"Go and wash your face."

1640
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:20,189
She is strong.

1641
00:53:21,045 --> 00:53:23,944
Show us a few of your dance skills.

1642
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:25,384
- Then, I'll... - Do what you do the best.

1643
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:27,062
- Start with popping. - Popping?

1644
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:32,922
(How good is Lia Kim, the world-class dancer?)

1645
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,617
(How good is Lia Kim, the world-class dancer?)

1646
00:53:38,003 --> 00:53:39,847
Let's see Lia Kim's dance skills.

1647
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:43,069
(She slowly moves to the rhythm.)

1648
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,899
(Her joints move freely.)

1649
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,151
She is twisting her body.

1650
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,862
She can twist her body like no other.

1651
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:50,669
Doesn't she have any bones?

1652
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:51,908
(She moves like mollusks.)

1653
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:52,979
Her facial expression is incredible.

1654
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,779
(Her moves are controlled...)

1655
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,149
(to go with the beats.)

1656
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:00,038
This is popping.

1657
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,049
(The members are surprised,)

1658
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,788
(but Lia Kim plays with the rhythm in a relaxed manner.)

1659
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:08,558
- Doesn't she have any bones? - She is amazing.

1660
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,729
Is that waacking?

1661
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:11,799
Yes, it is.

1662
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,058
(This time, it's waacking.)

1663
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:14,428
(To the rhythm,)

1664
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:16,899
(she moves her arms and legs.)

1665
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:18,939
(Her small body exudes explosive energy.)

1666
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,859
(Her knees slam into the floor.)

1667
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:22,069
(Are your knees okay?)

1668
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,150
This is it!

1669
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,927
This is waacking.

1670
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:27,695
That's enough.

1671
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,099
Hip-hop dance.

1672
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,319
(After popping and waacking)

1673
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,749
- She is an expert. - Hip-hop dance.

1674
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,319
- Hip-hop dance. - My goodness.

1675
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,249
Hip-hop dance should go like this.

1676
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,259
(Hip-hop dance is characterized by groovy moves.)

1677
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,618
She moves fast.

1678
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,115
(She becomes one with the music.)

1679
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,129
(This is the class of the world-famous dancer.)

1680
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,746
I am afraid her hips will dislocate.

1681
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,686
(He enjoys the dance in a daze.)

1682
00:54:51,469 --> 00:54:53,868
(She plays with the rhythm.)

1683
00:54:53,869 --> 00:54:56,408
(This is like a revival meeting.)

1684
00:54:56,409 --> 00:55:00,480
(Lia Kim, we believe in you!)

1685
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:03,848
- Lia. - My goodness.

1686
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:05,049
I got goosebumps.

1687
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,078
She is on another level.

1688
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,649
- She did this. - She was really fast.

1689
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:09,718
She moved so powerfully. Is your back okay?

1690
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,149
She was really fast.

1691
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,089
Where should we begin?

1692
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:17,888
We can work on the formation for the intro...

1693
00:55:17,889 --> 00:55:19,328
later on.

1694
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:21,529
Today, you will get the taste...

1695
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,799
of the dance moves.

1696
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,328
- Let's do that. - Let's get the taste.

1697
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:26,865
- Let's get the taste. - The beat is fast.

1698
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,502
This is how you start. Put your legs apart with a kick.

1699
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:33,439
- Jump and kick like this. - Bam!

1700
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,479
That's right. Your arms spread out.

1701
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,319
- Bam! - Yes. Combine them. Bam! Bam!

1702
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,618
- Bam! Bam! - Bring your limbs back.

1703
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:41,788
(Bring the arms and legs to the chest.)

1704
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:43,049
- I can do this. - That's right. Spread and fold.

1705
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,319
- You can do this, right? - Yes.

1706
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,319
I told you that you can do this.

1707
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,682
(Carefree)

1708
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:50,859
We can do this much.

1709
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,658
We aren't that terrible.

1710
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:54,399
We can do this much.

1711
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,075
The routine is a fast combination of these dance moves.

1712
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,138
- This is pretty doable. - Bam. Bam.

1713
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:03,768
As you put your arms down, cross the fists.

1714
00:56:03,769 --> 00:56:06,366
(As you put your arms down, cross the fists.)

1715
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:07,979
(Concentrating)

1716
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,969
All right. Everyone can do it.

1717
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,618
As the right foot goes back, pull the right arm.

1718
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:14,718
- Bam. - There you go.

1719
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:17,549
Now, throw your arm as if you are pitching...

1720
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,518
and move your foot to the front.

1721
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:20,618
Throw.

1722
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:23,184
(Throw your arm and move your foot to the front.)

1723
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:24,328
You can do every move.

1724
00:56:24,329 --> 00:56:25,440
(She is impressed.)

1725
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,928
Let's try it again.

1726
00:56:26,929 --> 00:56:28,229
- Lia. - Lia.

1727
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:29,669
(This is too much.)

1728
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:30,942
- Hold on. - This is too much.

1729
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,221
Just how hopeless did you think we would be?

1730
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:36,439
I looked in the mirror and everyone followed along.

1731
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,772
She is pacifying us as if we are children.

1732
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:43,009
I received the same treatment on the first day of boxing class.

1733
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:45,749
They told me that I am a secret weapon.

1734
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:47,348
(He becomes a secret weapon.)

1735
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:49,067
They told me not to use my fist haphazardly.

1736
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:52,058
When I did this, they went, "My goodness."

1737
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:53,319
Trainers are like that.

1738
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,955
- They wanted to motivate me. - Right. They do that.

1739
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,899
- Shall we try it slowly? Let's go. - Yes.

1740
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,779
(She breaks down the moves they have learned.)

1741
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:04,056
(They learn one part at a time.)

1742
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,968
(The members follow along.)

1743
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,238
Shall we try it a bit faster?

1744
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:10,238
- Okay. - It will become harder.

1745
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,238
In 5, 6...

1746
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:13,663
(They will connect the moves to the second part.)

1747
00:57:13,787 --> 00:57:16,917
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] SBS E455 Running Man</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

1748
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,149
That was almost perfect.

1749
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,078
- Is she making fun of us? - I am serious.

1750
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,837
I am the ace dancer among them.

1751
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:24,859
(I am the ace dancer.)

1752
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,819
Gosh, he became confident in no time.

1753
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,828
(He exudes confidence.)

1754
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:31,129
That was almost perfect. He is the best student.

1755
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:33,229
This must be why teachers compliment their students.

1756
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,428
Shall we try it? Let's go.

1757
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:37,669
(She checks each member.)

1758
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,238
(The ace dancer, Haha goes first.)

1759
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:41,967
(He does it without a problem.)

1760
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,385
That was good.

1761
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,556
(It's Jong Kook's turn.)

1762
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,249
- No words are needed. - Thank you.

1763
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:51,879
- Let's go. - She is generous with compliments.

1764
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,819
(Bam! Bam! Bam!)

1765
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:54,931
(Oh...)

1766
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,819
(Creaking)

1767
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,689
(She gives her first sigh.)

1768
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,089
Shall we try it again?

1769
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,259
(There was a hidden challenge.)

1770
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,658
She had a realization. "Oh."

1771
00:58:03,659 --> 00:58:04,872
The first obstacle.

1772
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,328
A small mountain you must climb over appeared.

1773
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:09,339
(It's the first out of many obstacles.)

1774
00:58:09,429 --> 00:58:11,899
I can't help but move this way because I am groovy.

1775
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,939
- Did you get it? - Really?

1776
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,538
Lia, how many of these four beats are there?

1777
00:58:16,539 --> 00:58:18,069
(An unexpected question...)

1778
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,439
(leaves Lia flustered.)

1779
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,848
Ji Hyo, this is the beginning.

1780
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:23,879
- I am curious. - There must be 400 beats.

1781
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,649
- 400 beats? - Maybe a couple of hundreds.

1782
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:28,215
When you go home today, you will sleep soundly.

1783
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:30,149
She will sleep like a baby.

1784
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,419
You have never received this kind of question, right?

1785
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,558
"How many of these four beats are there?"

1786
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,058
When she wakes up tomorrow, she will go,

1787
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:37,503
"For goodness' sake."

1788
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,029
I see a lot of potentials.

1789
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,428
- Really? - Yes.

1790
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:44,299
- Let's continue on. - Let's learn a bit more.

1791
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,299
(They continue on with the next move.)

1792
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,439
Grab the hand that comes over...

1793
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,908
and move your shoulders. Right, left,

1794
00:58:50,909 --> 00:58:53,979
right, left. Move your shoulders...

1795
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,178
four times.

1796
00:58:55,179 --> 00:58:56,866
Do it as you go up.

1797
00:58:57,449 --> 00:58:58,448
What was that?

1798
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:00,049
(Move your shoulders as you go up.)

1799
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,161
What was that?

1800
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,848
Kwang Soo and I are good at this.

1801
00:59:03,849 --> 00:59:05,288
- We can go down... - That's right.

1802
00:59:05,289 --> 00:59:07,006
and come up.

1803
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:08,558
He is good.

1804
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,689
(What do you think?)

1805
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:11,507
(I am good, right?)

1806
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:14,299
Kwang Soo, do this. He is good at going up.

1807
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,349
- Go up. - There you go.

1808
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,768
(He moves in a funny way.)

1809
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:21,467
Is there a mechanism for this?

1810
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,808
- He is good. - He is like a doll.

1811
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:25,879
- He is like a robot. - He is the best at going up.

1812
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,178
- He is the best at going up. - That was good.

1813
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:28,779
Let's do it again.

1814
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,049
(They go over what they learned.)

1815
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,819
2 and 3.

1816
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,189
(They follow along pretty well from part 1 to 4.)

1817
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,959
- 5, 6, 7, and 8. - Go up, step, and spread.

1818
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,495
(The dance moves come along.)

1819
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,658
You can do the moves. It's so fascinating.

1820
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:47,828
We can do the moves, but we don't look cool.

1821
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:50,052
(His self-examination is brutally honest.)

1822
00:59:50,769 --> 00:59:51,899
You are right.

1823
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,339
- That's the problem. - My goodness.

1824
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,138
- That was honest. - Seriously.

1825
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:56,709
- That was honest. - We don't look cool.

1826
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:57,868
- That was honest. - He is right.

1827
00:59:57,869 --> 00:59:59,860
- We don't look cool. - When you do the moves,

1828
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:02,348
you shouldn't push your hips back...

1829
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:04,919
because you will look funny.

1830
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,474
- I see. - For hip-hop dance,

1831
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,189
- you should stand like this. - Lia, you are a professional.

1832
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:10,888
- Seriously. - Lia.

1833
01:00:10,889 --> 01:00:12,819
(What's wrong?)

1834
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,859
You pulled up the T-shirt without hesitation.

1835
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,071
(You pulled up the T-shirt without hesitation.)

1836
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:17,729
We felt a bit comfortable.

1837
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,618
- We were behind you. - We understand, but...

1838
01:00:21,329 --> 01:00:24,069
(Her daring way of revealing the tip...)

1839
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,110
(left them flustered.)

1840
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:31,038
She pulled it up.

1841
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:34,738
We understand, but...

1842
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,549
I will wear those shorts the next time.

1843
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,549
(I will wear those shorts the next time.)

1844
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,267
- Don't do that. - No.

1845
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:40,948
Don't do that, Jae Seok.

1846
01:00:40,949 --> 01:00:42,131
Don't do that.

1847
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,239
I will wear those shorts.

1848
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,919
She wanted to show us the details.

1849
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,859
That's right. You need to learn how to use your body.

1850
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,589
That startled us.

1851
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,799
You are cool.

1852
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,093
- If you do this, you look funny. - That's right.

1853
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,729
- Do this instead. - This is...

1854
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,968
- what we need to learn. - Swagger.

1855
01:00:57,969 --> 01:00:59,656
- Roll up your body. - That's what we need to do.

1856
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:01,839
- Let's keep going. - We will work hard.

1857
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,879
From here...

1858
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,808
Move your body to the right...

1859
01:01:06,809 --> 01:01:09,678
and pop your shoulder once.

1860
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,979
- So... - Gosh, that's hard.

1861
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,474
Imagine hitting your chin with your shoulder.

1862
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:16,819
Move quickly like this. Left and right.

1863
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,859
- Left and right. - Your body...

1864
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,182
(He hits himself twice.)

1865
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,359
(Is it supposed to hurt this much?)

1866
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,349
Lia, he hit his own chin.

1867
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:27,158
It hurts so much.

1868
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:29,957
(Isn't this what I am supposed to do?)

1869
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:33,765
(She has never had students like them before.)

1870
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,227
- I did it unconsciously. - He really hit himself.

1871
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:38,430
Do it as if you're hitting.

1872
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:39,578
- As if you're hitting. - "As if"?

1873
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:40,922
Keep your head still.

1874
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,149
Like this.

1875
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:44,009
Move your torso.

1876
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:45,434
Go back and forth.

1877
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,118
Once on each side. Left hand, right hand.

1878
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,008
It looks amazing when Lia does it.

1879
01:01:51,719 --> 01:01:54,416
You're such a good teacher.

1880
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,488
Seriously.

1881
01:01:56,489 --> 01:01:57,828
- I think I can do it. - Right?

1882
01:01:57,829 --> 01:01:59,315
Shoulder, shoulder.

1883
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:01,177
- Hand, hand. - Hand, hand. Good.

1884
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,259
(The order is accurate.)

1885
01:02:04,769 --> 01:02:09,214
(It's the same dance but looks different.)

1886
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,828
She's such a good teacher.

1887
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,939
- It's the wrong hand movement. - What?

1888
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,768
(Those who watch are embarrassed.)

1889
01:02:15,849 --> 01:02:17,408
Shall we dance to the music?

1890
01:02:17,409 --> 01:02:18,732
- Okay. - That sounds good.

1891
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,765
(Can they dance to the music?)

1892
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,788
(The atmosphere changes when the music starts.)

1893
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:23,830
It looks amazing.

1894
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:27,018
(Her movements are accurate with the beat.)

1895
01:02:27,019 --> 01:02:28,189
That's great.

1896
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,459
(It's full of charm.)

1897
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,459
It looks amazing.

1898
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:32,176
(Is that what we learned?)

1899
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:34,759
That was amazing.

1900
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,880
Wait, Lia.

1901
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,299
- It's faster than I thought. - It's very fast.

1902
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,753
That was three seconds.

1903
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,050
It's so fast.

1904
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:42,638
We have to listen to the music...

1905
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:43,649
- in order to figure it out. - We should relax the torso.

1906
01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:47,547
At first, you may be wrong. You may not keep up with the beat.

1907
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,831
As you practice, you'll catch it.

1908
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,669
(At that moment)

1909
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,718
(All their moves are accurate to the beat.)

1910
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,819
He got it all.

1911
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:57,031
(All their moves are accurate to the beat.)

1912
01:02:59,789 --> 01:03:01,518
(Ace of dance, Haha)

1913
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:03,408
- You know it all. - No, Seok Jin.

1914
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:07,229
He's as good as the dancers in the video.

1915
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,149
No, not at all.

1916
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,289
- Dance solo, Haha. - Seriously.

1917
01:03:11,469 --> 01:03:13,216
You're very good at this part.

1918
01:03:14,269 --> 01:03:15,768
(Did you compliment me?)

1919
01:03:15,769 --> 01:03:17,009
Look at him.

1920
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,908
(He can't hide it even if he tries.)

1921
01:03:18,909 --> 01:03:21,439
He pretends to be amazing.

1922
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,723
Come here if you can't do it.

1923
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:24,279
This is why I don't want to practice with him.

1924
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:25,448
(Everyone is jealous of him.)

1925
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:26,691
He's so annoying.

1926
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,113
I want to do it. Is this it, Haha?

1927
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,567
What's wrong with you, So Min?

1928
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,313
So Min is a good dancer, but she has her own style.

1929
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,629
- She's good. - They're very good.

1930
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:37,741
She has her own style.

1931
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,029
When it comes to our ace dancers,

1932
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,615
they're Jong Kook and Haha.

1933
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:42,828
Let's watch them dance first.

1934
01:03:42,829 --> 01:03:44,299
- Let's divide into teams. - So Min is one of them.

1935
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,481
So Min.

1936
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,830
(They start with the music.)

1937
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,316
(They dance to the beat like an ace group.)

1938
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,709
(No one misses a move.)

1939
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,244
(They dance exactly what they learned.)

1940
01:04:00,619 --> 01:04:01,660
I'm sorry.

1941
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,541
(So Min and Haha bump into each other.)

1942
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:05,701
I'm sorry.

1943
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:07,288
(Instead of being flustered,)

1944
01:04:07,289 --> 01:04:08,629
(they concentrate until the end.)

1945
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:11,457
(They dance successfully to the end.)

1946
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,281
(She's truly surprised.)

1947
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,169
They're ace.

1948
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,229
That was perfect.

1949
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,513
That was amazing.

1950
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:19,982
It was great.

1951
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,499
(We did it.)

1952
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,782
They're very good.

1953
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:25,326
The rest of us should come out.

1954
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:26,891
It's a mixed group.

1955
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:29,479
- I feel too shy to do it. - Come this way.

1956
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,948
- Stand here, Ji Hyo. - She's the only woman.

1957
01:04:30,949 --> 01:04:32,162
(We can do it, odds and ends.)

1958
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,419
I know.

1959
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,763
- It ended so quickly. - It's hard to look cool.

1960
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,859
(Odds and ends also start.)

1961
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:41,172
I was late.

1962
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,971
This is bad.

1963
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:45,987
(This isn't easy.)

1964
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:48,717
What I'm doing is wrong.

1965
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,468
(He's creating another choreography.)

1966
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,776
(They're satisfied with themselves. "We danced well".)

1967
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,379
(Total disaster)

1968
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,178
This is what he did.

1969
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:02,979
- You did that. - Don't mock us.

1970
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,626
Don't laugh at us.

1971
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,948
We aren't laughing at you.

1972
01:05:06,949 --> 01:05:08,319
(We're in trouble.)

1973
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:09,359
Now,

1974
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,618
you memorized up to this point.

1975
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,377
- Let's go on. - Okay.

1976
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:15,652
- What's next? - When you come to this position,

1977
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,828
go up this way.

1978
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:17,971
This way.

1979
01:05:18,389 --> 01:05:21,428
This is the position. It's the 90-degree angle.

1980
01:05:21,429 --> 01:05:24,227
Lift it up like an elevator all the way to your elbow.

1981
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,711
Bend and lower it.

1982
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,259
- Lift your left arm again. - I'm confused.

1983
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:30,995
This arm will come down like an elevator.

1984
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:33,808
- This comes down. - Isn't it as hard as this?

1985
01:05:33,809 --> 01:05:34,819
(It's very advanced.)

1986
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,908
(The body and the mind move separately.)

1987
01:05:36,909 --> 01:05:38,162
It's very confusing.

1988
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,461
- Right. - Haha.

1989
01:05:39,579 --> 01:05:40,862
It's like the triangle and circle.

1990
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:42,934
Next,

1991
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:45,288
bring them in like this.

1992
01:05:45,289 --> 01:05:48,147
(Swing the hands together toward the stomach.)

1993
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:49,259
It's like we have a stomachache.

1994
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,488
Do it faster.

1995
01:05:50,489 --> 01:05:51,742
As if we have appendicitis.

1996
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,459
- Appendicitis. - My stomach.

1997
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,115
Open up quickly.

1998
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,428
- Next is here. - Here.

1999
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:58,939
(Raise the left hand with the right arm stretched out.)

2000
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,499
(Bring the left hand to the right.)

2001
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,439
(Pull the hands toward the chest.)

2002
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,368
(Then lower them.)

2003
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:06,209
- It's difficult. - It's hard.

2004
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:08,709
Clap your hands and send one hand away.

2005
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:10,249
(Send one hand to the back by clapping.)

2006
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,260
After that,

2007
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:16,064
- push forward your pelvis twice. - We saw that before.

2008
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:19,143
- The beat... - We're in big trouble.

2009
01:06:19,789 --> 01:06:21,536
Will we be able to do it later?

2010
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:26,660
(They dance up to where they learned to the music.)

2011
01:06:29,929 --> 01:06:32,727
(Ace Jong Kook and Haha learned perfectly.)

2012
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,596
(Is it the stomachache part?)

2013
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:39,508
7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4.

2014
01:06:39,539 --> 01:06:42,580
(There's an error due to a stomachache.)

2015
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,296
I can't follow the latter part.

2016
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:46,197
- I can't do it. - I'm in trouble.

2017
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,674
I can't do it after grabbing the appendix.

2018
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:51,419
As I grab the appendix, my body gets twisted.

2019
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,618
When I got to this part,

2020
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:53,730
I said, "I did it wrong."

2021
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,754
- Gosh, I'm wrong. - That's right.

2022
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,859
(He did well up to here.)

2023
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,098
(As soon as he grabs the stomach,)

2024
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:03,514
(I did it wrong.)

2025
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:07,299
- You can do it if you memorize it. - We have to get used to this.

2026
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,461
What if the half of us keep grabbing the appendix?

2027
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:11,553
The good dancers...

2028
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,979
do the original dance.

2029
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,859
The rest of us hold and rest.

2030
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,879
What are you talking about?

2031
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,379
We'll do this part in unison.

2032
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,834
Turn and do this twice.

2033
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,149
(She's speechless.)

2034
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:22,189
I'm sorry, Lia.

2035
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,888
(He's quick to notice.)

2036
01:07:24,889 --> 01:07:26,505
She was giving you a look, Seok Jin.

2037
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,018
That was a bad idea.

2038
01:07:28,019 --> 01:07:29,158
(No one can boss her around.)

2039
01:07:29,159 --> 01:07:30,341
I should practice it at home.

2040
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:32,342
I'll keep practicing at home, Lia.

2041
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:33,642
We can do it if we practice a lot.

2042
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:35,828
If you memorize it, you can do it.

2043
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:38,527
- You can do it with muscle memory. - It's possible.

2044
01:07:38,739 --> 01:07:41,138
- It is possible. - If you practice 100 times...

2045
01:07:41,139 --> 01:07:42,709
(She gives an extreme solution.)

2046
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,658
- Did you say 100 times? - Did I hear you correctly?

2047
01:07:44,869 --> 01:07:46,657
Did she say 100?

2048
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,609
If no one makes a mistake, do it 50 times.

2049
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:50,994
- Okay. - If no one makes a mistake.

2050
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:53,171
This is a boot camp.

2051
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,308
We shouldn't say the slogan at the end, right?

2052
01:07:56,519 --> 01:07:58,888
If you make a mistake, practice 20 more times.

2053
01:07:58,889 --> 01:08:00,909
- Oh, no... 120 times? - That's good, Lia.

2054
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,999
Let's stop, Hye Rang.

2055
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:03,900
What are you doing?

2056
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:06,658
(It's a privilege of a 54-year-old soldier.)

2057
01:08:06,659 --> 01:08:09,098
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

2058
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:10,768
- What did you say to her? - "Hye Rang"?

2059
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:11,799
Hye Rang.

2060
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,617
- Don't call her Hye Rang. - I'm sorry, Lia.

2061
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:15,185
I'm sorry. I must be out of my mind.

2062
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:16,784
- He's out of his mind. - Now, get ready.

2063
01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:18,569
He's about to lose it.

2064
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:19,609
Shall I take a look?

2065
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:21,709
(They practice 50 times if they get it correct.)

2066
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,073
(If one of them makes a mistake, they repeat 120 times.)

2067
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,649
(Will they pass the difficult part successfully...)

2068
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,366
(and do it 50 times?)

2069
01:08:29,289 --> 01:08:32,753
(Jae Seok's right foot moves one beat faster.)

2070
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:36,180
(Members don't know about it.)

2071
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:38,428
- No. - I got it wrong.

2072
01:08:38,429 --> 01:08:40,359
- We got everything right. - I got it wrong.

2073
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:41,511
Get down on all fours.

2074
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,328
Get on your knees.

2075
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:44,428
(How can you be so proud?)

2076
01:08:44,429 --> 01:08:45,611
We should practice.

2077
01:08:45,969 --> 01:08:47,768
- We should. - I thought about reducing it,

2078
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:48,839
but I had a change of heart.

2079
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,829
- Okay, it'll be 120 times. - Let's go.

2080
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:53,060
- How many was it originally? - Let's see.

2081
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:54,479
If we cry, can we go outside?

2082
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,832
(I can't do it 120 times.)

2083
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,308
(He tries to haggle with his tears.)

2084
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:59,718
Do I have to show tears...

2085
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:00,961
to go outside?

2086
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:02,801
I can't do it anymore.

2087
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:04,319
- Stop it. - I can't do it anymore.

2088
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,905
- Stop it. - Just to go out?

2089
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,202
We are being punished now.

2090
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:08,488
He asked if he can leave if he cries.

2091
01:09:08,489 --> 01:09:09,641
- I can stand this anymore. - Stop it.

2092
01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:11,928
How about no restroom break until you do it 100 times?

2093
01:09:11,929 --> 01:09:13,359
Do it without going to the restroom and going out.

2094
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,499
- Okay. - Okay, we'll do it.

2095
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,641
We have to dance while crying.

2096
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:17,868
Okay.

2097
01:09:17,869 --> 01:09:20,365
This is how I train dancers.

2098
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:22,738
- Seriously, - We'll practice.

2099
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:24,068
she's so strict.

2100
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:25,656
You can use the restroom after you do it 100 times.

2101
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,209
Get ready.

2102
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:29,673
- 5, 6, 7, and 8. - 5, 6, 7, 8.

2103
01:09:30,050 --> 01:09:31,608
- Wait. - Was I wrong?

2104
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:32,791
- The right side. - What's wrong?

2105
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:35,749
(They resume the training while holding back the tears.)

2106
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,618
(When everyone moved the right foot,)

2107
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:40,488
(Kwang Soo moved his left foot.)

2108
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,832
What's the matter?

2109
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:43,228
Did you move the right foot?

2110
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:44,673
- What's wrong with you? - What's wrong?

2111
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,228
- Left leg. - It's this foot.

2112
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:47,340
(Move the left leg.)

2113
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,559
Last time.

2114
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,828
(Why is everyone giving me a hard time?)

2115
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:51,228
He's crying.

2116
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:52,669
- Get out. - Kwang Soo is crying.

2117
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,255
(He finally bursts into tears.)

2118
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:57,238
(Finally Kwang Soo is crying.)

2119
01:09:57,409 --> 01:09:59,839
- Where is he going? - Hey, come here.

2120
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,455
- Cry here. - Come here.

2121
01:10:01,939 --> 01:10:03,364
- Do it while crying. - Come here.

2122
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:04,962
I really can't do it.

2123
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:08,249
I'll just do the wing walking instead.

2124
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,401
I'll go to Super Scary Labyrinth of Fear.

2125
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:11,408
- Go home. - Don't tell me to go home.

2126
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,602
Tell your mother.

2127
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,629
(I miss Mom.)

2128
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,889
Let's do this.

2129
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,981
(He stops crying, and they resume training again.)

2130
01:10:20,899 --> 01:10:22,486
(Squirming)

2131
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:26,139
(He steps backwards instead of dancing.)

2132
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:27,368
(What's wrong with my legs?)

2133
01:10:27,369 --> 01:10:29,056
It's confusing because of him.

2134
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:30,551
What's wrong?

2135
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,038
I thought he got shot.

2136
01:10:32,039 --> 01:10:33,049
(Seok Jin walks backwards.)

2137
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,204
- What's wrong with you? - I thought he got shot.

2138
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:38,009
(From the movie "The Front Line")

2139
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,578
(Shooting)

2140
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:40,791
(Goodness)

2141
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:43,434
- I thought he got shot. - What's wrong with you?

2142
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,089
- It's because... - I thought he got shot.

2143
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:46,459
I swung too hard.

2144
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:47,773
(He got too ambitious.)

2145
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,389
I lost my balance.

2146
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:50,459
What's wrong, Seok Jin?

2147
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:51,773
I lost my balance.

2148
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,353
- Lia, my legs are shaking. - All right.

2149
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,669
- Let's count together. - Okay.

2150
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,938
- Then you can memorize faster. - Let's try it.

2151
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:01,252
If we count together, will you reduce it by 10?

2152
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:02,550
Is that possible?

2153
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,426
(Shooting!)

2154
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:09,010
(Bullets are the best punishment for students who don't listen.)

2155
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,948
(He acts as if he got shot.)

2156
01:11:11,949 --> 01:11:13,448
He's the best actor for getting shot.

2157
01:11:13,449 --> 01:11:14,519
He's the best.

2158
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,419
- It looked real. - He's good.

2159
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,136
Go somewhere else for acting.

2160
01:11:18,789 --> 01:11:19,919
That was good.

2161
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,131
All right.

2162
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,672
Ready, set, go.

2163
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:25,182
- 5, 6, 7, and 8. - 5, 6, 7, and 8.

2164
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,512
Keep going. Get ready.

2165
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:31,060
(Their training continues without a break.)

2166
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:33,291
(No matter how exhausted they are,)

2167
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,794
(they repeat until they do it perfectly.)

2168
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,221
(He gulps down the water.)

2169
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,538
(Lia is still full of energy.)

2170
01:11:41,539 --> 01:11:44,075
- All right. - Lia is my type. I like her.

2171
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:46,618
It's 10th time.

2172
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:48,569
- It's 11th time. - 11th time.

2173
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:50,889
Lia.

2174
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,318
- Count properly. - Do we keep going?

2175
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:54,672
- Okay. - Get ready.

2176
01:11:54,789 --> 01:11:56,158
5, 6.

2177
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,371
Lia, it's this way.

2178
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:58,589
Lia.

2179
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,014
(Lia, it's this way.)

2180
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,269
- You need a break. - You should rest.

2181
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,868
- Take a break, Lia. - Take a break.

2182
01:12:04,869 --> 01:12:06,538
- Rest. It's okay. - Have a drink.

2183
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:07,799
It's okay, Lia.

2184
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,809
- Go and wash your face. - It's okay.

2185
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,309
Don't do it 100 times.

2186
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,592
Take a break.

2187
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:14,038
I'm tired too.

2188
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:16,049
Your personality comes out now that time has passed.

2189
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:17,349
Have some water.

2190
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:18,622
(She finds out about herself as she teaches bad dancers.)

2191
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:20,834
- Shall we start? - Okay.

2192
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,019
This is great. Let's go.

2193
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,635
What's so great?

2194
01:12:24,819 --> 01:12:26,419
- It's great to do it quickly. - Do you feel great?

2195
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,358
Five times to the music.

2196
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:29,629
We'll do it five times.

2197
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,158
- Lia. - After five times...

2198
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:32,188
This is great.

2199
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:34,559
- No, this is great for me. - We'll do it five times.

2200
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,929
- It's a great exercise. - Do it five times.

2201
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,499
- Do it five times. - Let's do it.

2202
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,898
- Lia is so strict. - Let's go.

2203
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:42,509
- Here we go. - Let's go. This is great.

2204
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:43,509
(He's very happy.)

2205
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:44,520
7, 8.

2206
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,938
(As the practice continues,)

2207
01:12:48,939 --> 01:12:51,309
(one person becomes happier.)

2208
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,329
(This is exciting.)

2209
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:54,298
- I'm so tired. - I'm tired.

2210
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,222
(Everyone is getting tired except for one person.)

2211
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:02,988
- I won't do it. - Let's keep going.

2212
01:13:02,989 --> 01:13:05,059
- Let's go. - Let's go. Okay.

2213
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,070
Get up.

2214
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:07,698
Please stop.

2215
01:13:07,699 --> 01:13:08,871
7, 8.

2216
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:13,139
(They're dancing,)

2217
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,120
(but their minds are off somewhere else.)

2218
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,552
(He's making a face.)

2219
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:19,879
(He's the only one smiling.)

2220
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,639
1 and 2 and keep going.

2221
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,379
1, 2, yes.

2222
01:13:23,380 --> 01:13:24,662
We got lost in the mood.

2223
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,465
- Stop now. - Five times.

2224
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:28,564
We can keep doing this.

2225
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,919
Let's go.

2226
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,549
- I can't do it anymore. - This is an exercise.

2227
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:32,759
Have some water.

2228
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,870
I love it.

2229
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,872
What should I do?

2230
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,759
What should I do?

2231
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:38,759
(Do what?)

2232
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,858
- Right now, - Do what?

2233
01:13:39,859 --> 01:13:41,398
- I'm so full of energy. - What's wrong?

2234
01:13:41,399 --> 01:13:43,450
Right now...

2235
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,618
- What? - I have to do something.

2236
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,999
- Right now. - What?

2237
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,958
- I have to do something. - What?

2238
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:51,368
- What's wrong? You're scary. - What's wrong with you?

2239
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:53,763
- My heart is beating fast. - Seriously.

2240
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:55,908
- My heart is beating fast. - I really hate him.

2241
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:56,908
(I never met a student like him.)

2242
01:13:56,909 --> 01:13:58,395
I'm just starting.

2243
01:13:58,609 --> 01:13:59,933
Let's start again, everyone.

2244
01:14:00,649 --> 01:14:02,749
- One more time? - Time is precious. Let's hurry.

2245
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:04,538
- Go to the gym after this. - Okay.

2246
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,288
Here is not your gym.

2247
01:14:06,289 --> 01:14:08,288
I'll go after my heart rate goes up.

2248
01:14:08,289 --> 01:14:09,328
Let's go.

2249
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,188
- Okay. - We have a long way to go.

2250
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:12,371
- Get ready. - Okay.

2251
01:14:12,859 --> 01:14:14,528
Ready, set, go.

2252
01:14:14,529 --> 01:14:16,528
(They continue to practice over 4 hours.)

2253
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:19,538
(They repeat 120 times.)

2254
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,099
- 1 and 2. - Kwang Soo is about to faint.

2255
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,584
- 3 and 4. - It's tiring.

2256
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,285
Now,

2257
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,778
I'll watch how you're doing.

2258
01:14:26,779 --> 01:14:28,839
Whether we do it well or not, we'll do it one last time.

2259
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,527
- Let's leave. - I'm leaving.

2260
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:32,179
You can't do that.

2261
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:33,492
We'll say goodbye next time.

2262
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,089
I'm leaving. I can't do it anymore.

2263
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:38,688
How about you dance individually?

2264
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:40,276
How about those who pass can leave?

2265
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:42,358
- That's cruel. - That sounds good.

2266
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:43,488
What's wrong with you?

2267
01:14:43,489 --> 01:14:44,959
You can go home if you make no mistakes.

2268
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,171
- It's like the room escape game. - It is, indeed.

2269
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:48,528
- Let's escape. - It's escaping from a room.

2270
01:14:48,529 --> 01:14:49,868
- How about 2 together? - 2 by 2?

2271
01:14:49,869 --> 01:14:52,799
Jae Seok and Kwang Soo have to dance all night.

2272
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,898
Two of you dance together.

2273
01:14:53,899 --> 01:14:55,198
- Let's hurry and go. - Go home if you make no mistakes.

2274
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,738
- Try it. - Do we dance by two?

2275
01:14:56,739 --> 01:14:58,225
Play the music.

2276
01:14:58,640 --> 01:14:59,639
They'll do well.

2277
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,457
(Jong Kook and Haha try first.)

2278
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:04,662
They're good.

2279
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:08,231
They look amazing.

2280
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,006
(They're good.)

2281
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,340
(They get the stomachache part perfectly.)

2282
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:18,459
(Jong Kook gets the last part wrong.)

2283
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,629
- That was right. - Jong Kook almost had it.

2284
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:21,658
I got the last part wrong.

2285
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:22,929
- They dance well. - He got the last part wrong.

2286
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:24,799
Haha can go home.

2287
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,099
I'm jealous.

2288
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,110
Haha can go home.

2289
01:15:27,369 --> 01:15:28,639
(He escapes like an ace.)

2290
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,386
He goes home!

2291
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:32,209
Would you like to try again?

2292
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:33,209
- Yes. - Try it again.

2293
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,938
Can I dance with a pair?

2294
01:15:34,939 --> 01:15:36,249
- How about... - Three of you dance.

2295
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:37,321
With me and So Min.

2296
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,778
Start.

2297
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:42,728
(They're determined to escape.)

2298
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,658
(He was doing well.)

2299
01:15:52,659 --> 01:15:54,518
(Then he misses the beat.)

2300
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,269
(Perfect)

2301
01:15:58,270 --> 01:15:59,738
They passed.

2302
01:15:59,739 --> 01:16:00,969
- That was correct. - Okay.

2303
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,585
Neither of them made a mistake.

2304
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:04,938
Good job.

2305
01:16:04,939 --> 01:16:07,202
- You successfully escaped. - Success!

2306
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,509
- 2 people. - 2? Okay.

2307
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:11,278
- Start. - One.

2308
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:12,765
(He looks determined.)

2309
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:19,608
(He's better than we expected.)

2310
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,340
(This is Se Chan's second try.)

2311
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,404
(It's the difficult stomachache part.)

2312
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:27,459
(He succeeds without trouble.)

2313
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,459
I got it.

2314
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,769
(Kwang Soo is doing well.)

2315
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:33,628
(After missing a beat, he has a meltdown.)

2316
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,886
(Fluttering)

2317
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:38,568
(I won't be going home today.)

2318
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,139
Se Chan passed.

2319
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,755
- You're impressive. - Seriously.

2320
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,428
(Seok Jin and Ji Hyo's turn)

2321
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,549
(He dances quite well.)

2322
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:49,560
He dances well.

2323
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,618
(They don't look good, but the order is perfect.)

2324
01:16:51,619 --> 01:16:53,539
- That's right. - It's right.

2325
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:57,587
(Suddenly there's a duck move.)

2326
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:59,559
(He adds a new move.)

2327
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:00,959
Wait a minute.

2328
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,040
Seok Jin.

2329
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:04,398
Didn't he do this last time?

2330
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:06,398
- Why would you make a pigeon? - Didn't a pigeon fly by?

2331
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:07,868
Why would you make a pigeon?

2332
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:09,486
Why did you do this move?

2333
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:12,139
- Something flew by. - What was that?

2334
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:14,765
- Ji Hyo passed. - You passed.

2335
01:17:14,939 --> 01:17:16,021
You passed.

2336
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:18,108
Kwang Soo, let's give it a try.

2337
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,249
Let's do it neatly.

2338
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,835
- Music. - I'm confused.

2339
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:30,552
They're very good.

2340
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:35,386
(Kwang Soo makes a mistake of stepping forward.)

2341
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,868
He got it wrong.

2342
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:38,068
(Except for one mistake, both were perfect.)

2343
01:17:38,069 --> 01:17:39,438
That wasn't bad.

2344
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:40,568
No.

2345
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:41,999
- Was it vague? - He passed.

2346
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,309
- Did I pass? - Yes.

2347
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,350
Did he pass?

2348
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:46,391
He passed.

2349
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:47,938
- Are you ready? - Yes.

2350
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:49,464
Seok Jin is so funny.

2351
01:17:49,909 --> 01:17:50,978
I can do it.

2352
01:17:50,979 --> 01:17:52,394
Music, start.

2353
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,437
(Flinching)

2354
01:17:57,220 --> 01:17:58,419
(He's unstable from the beginning.)

2355
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,531
Why did you do that?

2356
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:02,089
(He calms himself down.)

2357
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,180
(They start seriously.)

2358
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:12,321
(They're perfect so far.)

2359
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:14,969
(Losing balance)

2360
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:16,625
- Wait. - What? Why?

2361
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:20,209
(Someone always shoots after some time.)

2362
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,839
- What's wrong, Seok Jin? - He got shot again.

2363
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,209
Who shot you?

2364
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:24,709
- Don't shoot him. - Hey.

2365
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,919
- Who keeps shooting him? - Who shot him?

2366
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:28,379
Don't shoot.

2367
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,207
Did you get electrified?

2368
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,363
That's not it.

2369
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:34,204
I had to stretch out my arm.

2370
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,429
He went backwards.

2371
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:37,459
(Seok Jin blocked his way.)

2372
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:40,129
I swung too hard again.

2373
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,312
I should have controlled it.

2374
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:42,783
- I tried to look cool. - Lia.

2375
01:18:43,529 --> 01:18:44,842
Please stop.

2376
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,818
Seok Jin might die at this rate.

2377
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,038
This is enough.

2378
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:52,139
(He might die from exhaustion.)

2379
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,978
- Do it well. - Try it again.

2380
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:55,020
- It's the last time. - Last time.

2381
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:56,823
Okay, it's the last.

2382
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:59,330
Even if you move back, I'll stretch out my arm.

2383
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,863
- No matter what, - I'm sorry.

2384
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,333
- I'll poke you. - Okay, I'm sorry.

2385
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:03,589
Okay, okay.

2386
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:05,749
(Concentrating)

2387
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,275
- Start. - Go.

2388
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:16,740
It's okay so far.

2389
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,043
You have to do this part well.

2390
01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:24,779
(Will he continue to dance without getting shot?)

2391
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,867
(Seok Jin always got shot after this move.)

2392
01:19:28,439 --> 01:19:30,849
(Will he pass it safely?)

2393
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,162
(He passes.)

2394
01:19:32,449 --> 01:19:33,894
(Lia is also impressed.)

2395
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,175
Okay, you got it.

2396
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,609
You did it. You did it.

2397
01:19:42,789 --> 01:19:43,972
I did it.

2398
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,528
- You got it. - You made it.

2399
01:19:46,529 --> 01:19:47,728
Thank you.

2400
01:19:47,729 --> 01:19:49,398
We should recognize what deserves recognition.

2401
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:50,599
Thank you.

2402
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,839
- Seok Jin's impressive for his age. - Seriously.

2403
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:53,868
(Infinite training changed Seok Jin.)

2404
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,669
- That was impressive. - You made it.

2405
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,720
I made it.

2406
01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,908
How long is the dance that we just learned?

2407
01:19:59,909 --> 01:20:01,839
About 17 to 18 seconds.

2408
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,209
- We spent 5 hours for 18 seconds. - 18 seconds out of 3 minutes.

2409
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:07,919
We're worried since we're still not perfect for those 18 seconds.

2410
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,738
The latter part is less difficult than the beginning.

2411
01:20:09,789 --> 01:20:12,488
- Really? - The beginning is the hardest.

2412
01:20:12,489 --> 01:20:13,618
- Is that so? - Yes.

2413
01:20:13,619 --> 01:20:15,589
- Lia was with us. - That's a relief.

2414
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:18,155
We could do it because we were in front of the cameras.

2415
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,259
(They can do anything in front of the cameras.)

2416
01:20:20,260 --> 01:20:22,198
What if there were no cameras?

2417
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:23,685
If there were no cameras,

2418
01:20:23,829 --> 01:20:25,629
we'd have gone home after less than an hour.

2419
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:28,139
We made it because of the cameras.

2420
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,769
- We'd like to tell the viewers. - That's right.

2421
01:20:29,770 --> 01:20:32,497
Lia, I really enjoyed it...

2422
01:20:32,539 --> 01:20:34,608
- today. - Thank you.

2423
01:20:34,609 --> 01:20:36,648
- See you again next time. - Thank you, Lia.

2424
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:38,448
(How will their performance be at their fan-meet?)

2425
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:40,549
(What if members become lyrics?)

2426
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:42,913
(It's time to decide the lyrics for Running Man's title song.)

2427
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:45,448
(They reflect on what members represent.)

2428
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:48,014
(8 poets write modifiers.)

2429
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,459
(They're generous with their own modifier.)

2430
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,999
(They're strict with modifiers for other members.)

2431
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,756
(And the patterns of creating modifiers change drastically.)

2432
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,515
(Jae Seok, a positive word)

2433
01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:00,367
(It's a battle of lyrics as they exchange words of blessing.)

2434
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,580
(And)

2435
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:05,647
(Bizarre missions for lyricists)

2436
01:21:05,909 --> 01:21:08,667
(Who will be the final winner to decide the lyrics?)
